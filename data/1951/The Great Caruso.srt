It's not the first time
I've fainted, or the last.

33
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,158

left the choir.

for the procession.

I feel very happy.

the good <i>Dio</i> spared you to sing.

You must use it.

You want to get married?

But what will you feed
you and Musetta

80
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,002
and the <i>bambino</i>
that will come each year?

81
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:50,090
Sacks of flour! Sacks and sacks
and sacks from my flour mill?

82
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,050
I know you do not like me,
<i>signor</i>, but--

83
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,678
Enrico, listen to papa,
please!

84
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,889
You're wrong, Enrico.

85
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:00,391
You like my daughter
and I like you.

86
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,436
You need a wife,
I need a son.

87
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,232

you will be the big boss

00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,900

00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,819

90
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,904

91
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,989
You are very generous sir,
but I--

92
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,743
- But?
- Enrico, listen to papa.

93
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,537
I have listened to papa.

94
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,039
Perhaps for a minute
someone will listen to me!

95
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,668
It is true, <i>Signor</i> Barretto

96
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,837
that right now
I sing for pennies.

97
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,798
Pennies are not very important
in a big house like this.

98
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,009
But the singing,
that is important everywhere.

99
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,928
It makes people feel
good inside.

100
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,264
It takes away the ugliness,
the sadness

101
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,599
and it fills
the empty place here.

102
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,893
That too is something,
<i>signor</i>, isn't it?

103
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,105
No son-in-law of mine
begs for pennies.

104
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,899
If that is your answer,
<i>Signor</i> Caruso, I say, <i>addio</i>!

105
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,777
Egisto, they are in love!

106
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,450
Musetta is my only child.

107
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,162
I would like for her
to be comfortable and happy.

108
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,705
Is this unreasonable?

109
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,499
It's most reasonable.

110
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,293
Then?

111
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,132
<i>Si, signor.</i>

112
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,425

I haven't seen you for months.

117
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,586
I'm no longer a singer,
I'm a merchant.

118
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,588
I congratulate you, Enrico.

119
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,715
In Naples,
everybody is a singer,

One in 10,000.

- Ah, wonderful.

Come, come and sit!

125
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,900
No, I have much business
to attend.

126
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,443
Oh, I see. I see.

127
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,903
You got money
in your pockets now

128
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,405
so you got no time
for old friends, eh?.

129
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,157
You speak foolish.

130
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,451
It was fun in old days,
huh,Enrico?

131
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,203
A man must use his head, Fucito.

132
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,373
People have to eat,
to eat you must have money.

133
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,500
They eat.

134
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,085
And they eat good too

135
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,212
and they drink champagne.

136
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,338
Enrico: Who are they?
Merchants?

137
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,048
Merchants?
Singers!

138
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,676
From the San Carlos
Opera House.

139
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,135
- From San Carlos?
- Ah.

140
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,472
Alfredo Brazzi, the tenor,
and Carmeli.

141
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,641
No!

142
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,269
Enrico, why don't you
let them hear

143
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,437
what a real singer sounds like?

144
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,439
Oh, I can't sing anymore.

145
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,277

146
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,404

00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,985
You use your voice nicely.

155
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,446
You had some training?

156
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,031
I was taught by
Father Bronzetti.

157
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,616
Oh. And where do you
sing now?

158
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,035
Well, I'm not really a singer.

159
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,411
I'm a flour merchant.

160
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,205
Oh. With that chest,
with that voice?

161
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,041
That's what I tell him,
gentlemen.

162
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,960
He can sing anything!
High, low, <i>adaio, andante</i>--

163
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,712
Fucito, these men
are professionals.

164
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,630
Oh, go ahead, young man.
Never mind that.

165
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,050
Of course, <i>signor</i>, of course.

- The flour!
- The flour.

177
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,208
The customers, the business.
They're gone!

178
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,587
I'm a ruined man.
But it's my fault, I'm to blame.

179
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,589
You know why?
I will answer that.

180

not my head.

00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,801
I took him into the mill.

182
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,011
I have treated him like a son.

183
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,305
And see what happened?

184
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,725
You were born a beggar
and you will die a beggar.

185
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,896
You, you singer for pennies!

186
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,439
Enrico: <i>Signor</i> Barretto!

187
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,900
- You singer for pennies!
- <i>Signor</i>.

188
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,861
<i>Signor</i> Barretto, I'll deliver
the flour if it takes all night!

189
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,362
- What the flour?
- I'll pay.

190
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,698
- I'll pay for everything.
- From singing?

191
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,617
Yes! If you'll only
trust my voice.

192
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,118
I could get rich from singing!

193
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,078
I could cover Musetta with gold
from singing.

194
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,664
- Now promise me one thing.
- Anything, <i>signor</i>. Anything.

195
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,416
If you don't keep away
from my house,

196
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,252
my daughter, my flour mill,
do you know what I will do?

197
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,547
I will answer that!
I will kill you!

198
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,966
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

199
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,595
Who won, Enrico?

200
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,306
Enrico: I'm no longer
a flour merchant.

201
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,517
- Good.
- You're young, you're strong.

202
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,852
And without a penny.

203
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,313
Tell me, <i>Signor</i> Brazzi,
were you making fun of me

204
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,774
or is my voice good enough
to make a living?

205
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,109
I don't mean in cafes
or street carnivals,

206
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,571
but, but in the opera houses.
Please tell me, <i>signor</i>.

207
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,574
Perhaps, if you are
willing to learn,

208
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,868
but if you want to be
a divo overnight...

209
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,787
I don't care
if I'm never a divo,

210
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,248
just as long as I can make
a decent living.

211
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,208
I heard you carry a tune,

212
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,793
but can you carry a spear?

213
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,920
I know I can carry
a sack of flour.

214
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,672
I think I can carry a spear.

215
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,048
Better.

216
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,721
[singing in foreign language]

217
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,204
[singing in foreign language]

218
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,096
[singing in foreign language]

219
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,081
[singing in foreign language]

220
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,528
[singing continues]

221
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,081
[audience cheering]

222
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,500
[instrumental music]

223
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,595
Papa!

224
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,306
Papa, I'm home!

225
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,683
Papa!

226
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,020
Not here.

227
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,814
<i>Bambino</i>, have you seen
Papa Caruso?

228
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,941
<i>Si, signor</i>. At the barbershop.

229
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,025
- You settle everything here.
- <i>Si</i>.

230
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,443
I surprise papa.

231
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,160
- Careful, the ear, my son.
- Oh, <i>si</i>.

232
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,538
What I do for friendship.

233
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,915
Am I not brave to be shaved
by an apprentice?

234
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,458
I'm a master barber,

235
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,752
but to my father
I'm always an apprentice.

236
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,713
I have only one papa,
be careful, Gino!

237
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,048
- Enrico!
- Hey!

238
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,174
- Enrico!
- Papa!

239
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,135
My son.

240
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,095
You look beautiful!

241
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,097
You like it, huh?

242
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,640
When I tell Egisto Barretto

243
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,809
what I paid for this suit,
he will not believe it.

244
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,394
And wait till
he sees the presents,

245
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,979
something for everybody.

246
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,064
And for you, papa, a gold watch.

247
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,400
- A gold watch?
- A millionaire?

248
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,069
Enrico, tell me the truth.
From singing?

249
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,779
Two hundred lire performance.

250
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,198
Sometimes I don't
believe it myself.

251
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,533
I will show the flour merchant

252
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,784
that I do not need
his flour mill

253
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,661
to support Musetta
like a princess.

254
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,622
Enrico, let me tell you
about <i>Signor</i> Barretto--

255
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,874
I know him better than you.

256
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,584
All he wants
money, money, money.

257
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,962
- But, Enrico--
- Papa, don't be concerned.

258
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,339
He will welcome me
as his son-in-law.

259
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,508
He is not like Musetta.

260
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,844
Musetta is married.

261
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,849
I do not believe it.

262
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,559
Enrico, wait!
Wait!

263
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,686
- Gino, look after him.
- <i>Si</i>.

264
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:15,858
If she were the right girl

265
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,234
she would've waited for you.

266
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,029
- Be quiet.
- I'm quiet.

267
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,531
But in my heart, I envy you.

268
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,909
Fine clothes, money.

269
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,620
With your voice
the world is open to you.

270
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,705
And the world is full of girls.

271
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,040
You are really very lucky.

272
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,958
Who wants to see the world?

273
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,628
I do.
But who gets to see it?

274
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,087
Barber? No.

275
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,590
A singer? Yes.
Now if I were you--

276
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,009
So, you want to see the world,
huh?

277
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,386
Alright.
I take you with me.

278
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,223
I? I'm not an accomplice
like Fucito. I--

279
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,099
- That's business.
- I know.

280
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:52,603
But I'm just a barber.
What have I to offer you?

281
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,775
Friendship. I need a friend.

282
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:00,653
- Then I go with you.
- We leave tonight.

283
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,029
I do not want to see Naples

284
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,740
and I do not want
to see Musetta.

285
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,742
You go to <i>Signor</i> Barretto.

286
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,369
Tell him the flour is paid for.

287
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,538
- <i>Si. Si!</i>
- From singing!

288
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:11,622
[instrumental music]

289
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,470
Hutchins: You know
that bartender is second scene.

290
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,888
Hutchins!

291
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,975
Yes, Ms. Selka.

292
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,310
Have you any idea
how long I have been waiting?

293
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,896
About two and a half minutes,
I should say.

294
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,356
That is not the point.

295
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,859
The point is that
I am being kept waiting.

296
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,069
It is an indignity!
An insult!

297
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,780
Oh, <i>Signor</i> Caruso only
arrived in England yesterday.

298
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,532
Perhaps he's lost his way.

299
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,701
- Patience.
- How dare you?

300
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,494
I merely said
I was playing patience,

301
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:53,205
however, if you care for
some two-handed casino.

302
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,457
[scoffs] It is obvious
why you have been cast

303
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,502
in the role of the jester,
<i>Signor</i> Scotti.

304
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,297
This could not happen in Vienna
or Budapest.

305
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,090
There we have discipline.

306
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,967
We would not permit
an artist like myself

307
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,928
to be insulted
by a Italian upstart.

308
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,597
Hardly an upstart, Ms. Selka.

309
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,432
<i>Signor</i> Caruso's talent
has earned him medals

310
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,058
from the Sultan of Turkey,
the King of Belgium,

311
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:15,102
the Czar of Russia.

312
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,687
His voice
is his recommendation.

313
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,732
Tenor is not a voice,
it is a disease.

314
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,150
[indistinct chatter]

315
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,444
[speaking in foreign language]

316
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,239
- Excuse me, <i>Signor</i> Hutchins.
- Look at him!

317
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,825
Wouldn't you know
he was an Italian tenor?

318
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,831
Perhaps my English is not good
to understood your joke.

319
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,709
Your English is vile
and your clothes are worse.

320
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,337
You have the manners
of a Naples street singer.

321
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,423
When you meet a lady?
Take your hat off!

322
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,052
[speaking in foreign language]

323
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,846
Don't worry, Hutchins.
The house will be filled.

324
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,808
[speaking in foreign language]

325
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,894
Don't lose your head, <i>amico</i>.
You have a contract.

326
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,229
[speaking in foreign language]

327
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,441
It's wrong, <i>amico</i>.

328
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,651
Next to the Metropolitan,

329
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,110
this debut in Covent Garden

330
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,029
is the most important for you.

331
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,782
I told you in Italian,
I tell you in English,

332
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,867
I do not sing with Maria Selka!

333
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,578
[speaking in foreign language]

334
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,205
- I do not go back.
- I don't blame you.

335
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,457
I've spent my life being
insulted by prima donnas,

336
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,709
I wonder how I stand it
or why.

337
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:23,545
I do not have to
bend the knee to that...

338
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,547
<i>Signor</i> Hutchins,
my English is not good.

339
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:26,590
Gino, the book.

340
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:27,841
[speaking in foreign language]

341
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,638
In Italian,
I know the word.

342
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,056
Whatever you call her,
<i>Signor</i> Caruso.

343
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,432
And in whatever language,

344
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:36,934
you do it with my blessings.

345
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,812
She behaves badly,
but she sings beautifully.

346
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,356
She makes me so mad
I cannot sing.

347
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,150
Well, you're not mad at me,
are you, <i>Signor</i> Caruso?

348
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,443
Not you, <i>signor</i>.

349
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:47,778
And you're not mad at the music.

350
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,405
So why make her too important?

351
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,740
She'd be delighted
if she drove you out.

352
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,535
After the performance, you have
my permission to kill her.

353
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,787
[laughing]

354
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:02,459
For you and for the music,
I go back.

355
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:05,587
But remember,
I do not swallow the insults.

356
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,425

357
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,645

00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,775
[singing continues]

362
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:13,298
[audience applauding]

363
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:23,684
[indistinct chatter]

364
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:31,066
- Enrico. Enrico.
- Scotti, how did you like?

365
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,277
One performance
and you captured London.

366
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,611
<i>Grazie!</i>

367
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,822
No flour in the throat tonight.

368
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,243
- Alfredo!
- Enrico!

369
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,120
How did you like?
Did I do you credit?

370
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,747
I've never seen
any thing like that audience.

371
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,958
Fucito, you remember
the great tenor, Brazzi?

372
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,752
<i>Si, si,</i> from San Carlos.

373
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,921
It's good to see a face
from Naples.

374
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,841
Gino, my dear friend,
Alfredo Brazzi.

375
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,093
[speaking in foreign language]

376
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,013
Come, we can talk alone, huh?

377
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,974
[speaking in foreign language]

378
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,435
Tell me, why didn't you let me
know you were here too?

379
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,439
You are the big divo now.

380
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:14,109
Not to my friends.
Are you on tour here?

381
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,445
- I live here.
- In London?

382
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,615
Mm. Five years.

383
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:23,118
You see, Enrico,
you have found your voice,

384
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,786
but I have lost mine.

385
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:32,211
- Alfredo?
- Oh. Do not worry, my friend.

386
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,214
I manage to eat, to live.

387
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,344
Alfredo, you must do me
the great favor.

388
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,512
Anything.
Anything I can.

389
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:46,767
To singing Alfredo is good,
but the business of singing,

390
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,687
contracts, concerts, tours,
I go crazy!

391
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,731
Would you be my manager?

392
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,819
Unless you have
more important work.

393
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,613
I work in a bank.

394
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,448
[speaking in foreign language]

395
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:02,866
A banker?

396
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,160
I open the door for the banker.

397
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,415
Tell him to open his own door!
It's settled.

398
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,501
<i>Amico,</i> you have saved my life.

399
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,796
Gino, Fucito!
Salute our new manager.

400
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,714
[laughing]

401
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,550
[instrumental music]

402
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,123
[music continues]

403
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,720
[instrumental music]

404
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,941
Excuse me, <i>Signor</i> Gatti-Casazza.
Please.

405
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,860
<i>Caro amico. Salute.</i>

406
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,612
I did not want to be late,
but you know I get mixed up.

407
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,740
We do not mind waiting
a few minutes, Enrico.

408
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,867
I want to make the apology
to you and--

409
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,121
Good heavens,
is that the Great Caruso?

410
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,664
He's certainly no
Jean de Reszke.

411
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,916
Not in looks, but Santi said

412
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,210
he was a sensation
at Covent Garden.

413
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,379
But this is the Metropolitan,
my dear.

414
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,506
- Gatti: Louise.
- Yes, Gatti.

415
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,883
Gatti: Please.

416
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,718
Enrico, you have not met
our great soprano,

417
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,012
Louise Heggar.

418
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,014
Please, <i>signorina</i>, forgive me.

419
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,433
Of course, but for what,
<i>Signor</i> Caruso?

420
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,518
- I make you wait.
- Oh!

421
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,270
I'm often late myself.

422
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,106
- Then you're not angry?
- Certainly not.

423
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,026
Gatti, this lady
is not a soprano.

424
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,904
- <i>Si. Si</i>.
- I do not believe it.

425
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:09,284
Such a kind lovely, charming
and beautiful young lady.

426
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,119
You cannot be a prima donna.

427
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,413
[laughter]

428
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,665
- Santi.
- Santi: Enrico.

429
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,376
[speaking in foreign language]

430
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:18,794
- Remember Covent Garden?
- Yes.

431
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,171
- It's nice to see you here too.
- Thank you.

432
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,048
This is a wonderful place, huh?

433
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,383
Wonderful country.

434
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,259
- I am ready to begin.
- Good.

435
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,636
Uh, today I only want

436
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,596
to go over a few of
the solo numbers.

437
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,682
Uh, Miss Heggar, please,
the end of your first aria?

438
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,310
I shall begin at <i>"Numi, pieta."</i>

439
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,313
Uh, gentleman,
that is number 49.

440
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,984
[orchestral music]

441
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,412
[singing in foreign language]

442
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,110
<i>Brava.</i>

443
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,781
It will be a great pleasure
to sing with you.

444
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,908
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

445
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:58,453
Uh, Enrico, let's try
"Celeste Aida"

446
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,163
with the "Recitativo."

447
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,290
Uh, gentlemen.

448
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,293
[instrumental music]

449
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,093

450
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:14,904
[singing continues]

451
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:47,520
[singing continues]

452
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,929
[singing continues]

453
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,380
[singing continues]

454

[singing continues]

455
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,167
[applauding]

456
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,377
Now, I look forward
to this season.

457
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,463
- <i>Grazie</i>.
- Bravo, bravo.

458
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,340
- What a wonderful voice.
- Thank you.

459
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,051
Louise, you're standing
in the draft.

460
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,011
You've got to learn
to take care of yourself.

461
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,429
I have to go to the office.

462
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:27,972
I'll be back for you
after the rehearsal.

463
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:31,059
- Alright.
- <i>Signor</i>, need not trouble.

464
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,812
May I have the pleasure
to take you home?

465
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:36,397
Of course, with the permission
of your father.

466
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,440
[indistinct]

467
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,237
Park.

468
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,076
Gatti, maybe I make
a little mistake.

469
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,953
He is not the papa?

470
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:53,164
Mr. Benjamin is a very generous
patron of the Metropolitan.

471
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:56,417
Oh! I make a big mistake.

472
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,627
Mm.

473
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,723
Enrico? <i>Momento</i>.

474
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,809
Remember what I told you to say.

475
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,854
I say I came to make the apology
and I, um...

476
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,772
[chuckles] Regret.

477
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,607
I regret that
I called the old man--

478
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,652
Unh-unh, unh-unh,
the distinguished gentleman.

479
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,488
<i>Destro</i>. The distinguished
gentleman, your father.

480
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:28,241
It was a natural mistake
when I see so charming and--

481
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,243
No, no, so young and charming.

482
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:33,288
No lady cannot be angry
when you call her young.

483
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,290
<i>Si, si</i>.

484
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,420
[bells ringing]

485
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,381
I regret
the distinguished gentleman

486
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,342
so young and charming.

487
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,678
Excuse me,
maybe I make a mistake.

488
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,471
Miss Hagger lives here?

489
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,182
- This is Miss Hagger's house.
- Good.

490
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,768
I am Enrico Caruso
from the Metropolitan Opera.

491
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,729
Would you tell her
that I'm here now?

492
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,732
I expect her any minute
if you'd like to wait.

493
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,572
May I help you, Miss Dorothy?

494
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,033
<i>Signor</i> Caruso's
from the Metropolitan.

495
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,826
He has an appointment
with Miss Hagger.

496
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,620
Your tea is all ready,
Miss Dorothy.

497
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,330
Thank you.

498
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,332
- Would you come in?
- <i>Grazie</i>.

499
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,086
How do you like your tea,
<i>Signor</i> Caruso?

500
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,882
At first, not at all,
but in London I get used to it.

501
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:29,302
I mean, cream, sugar or nothing?

502
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,387
Nothing.

503
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:34,641
In America, everything is said
with the teeth.

504
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:38,645
Nothing. Thank you, Dorothy.

505
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:40,688
But Italian is soft.

506
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,399
<i>Grazie</i>.

507
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,195
[speaking in foreign language]

508
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,823
<i>Signorina</i> Doro? That is nice.

509
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,909
- You like it?
- Mm-hm.

510
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:58,206
It has a nice sound,
<i>Signorina</i> Doro, like music.

511
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,749
You like music?

512
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,542
Oh, I don't know much about it.

513
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,545
You live in the soprano's house
and you do not know about music?

514
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,798
Oh, I don't live here.
I live at school.

515
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,384
- Enrico: You have no house?
- Yes, my father's house.

516
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,136
But most of the time
I live at school.

517
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,305
It's vacation now and

518
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,015
well I guess Louise
is the closest friend

519
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,017
father and I have so...

520
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:19,811
So, and your mother?

521
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,981
My mother has been dead
for many years, Mr. Caruso.

522
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,567
Oh, and how nice you have
a friend like Miss Hagger.

523
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,862
She's a charming woman,
sings good too.

524
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,031
You sing a little?

525
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,491
Dorothy: Not the way
you mean it.

526
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,452
At school and chapel,
we all have to sing.

527
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,999
[singing in foreign language]

528
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,468
Come sing with me.

529
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,927
Oh, no.

530
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:37,638
I know enough music to know
I can't sing.

531
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,350
She can't sing?

532
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,603
The little daughter cannot sing.

533
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,897
Always the ladies come to me
to be singers.

534
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,524
They have no voice,
but they sing.

535
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:50,151
It is like fresh air
to meet someone

536
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,612
who cannot sing and knows it.

537
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,948
When you grow up,
<i>Signorina</i> Doro, do not change

538
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:58,117
and you will be one woman
in the millions.

539
00:42:58,201 --> 00:42:59,410
We're friends, huh?

540
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:04,290
Dorothy. Oh!

541
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,834
<i>Signor</i> Caruso,
what a wonderful surprise.

542
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:10,254
Gracias. Miss Hagger,
I come to make the apology.

543
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:13,132
I regret I call that old...

544
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,718
Excuse me, I must go now.

545
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,971
- But <i>Signor</i> Caruso.
- Thank you.

546
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:21,390
Very pleasant. <i>Arrivederci</i>.

547
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:24,393
- What on earth?
- The man's insane.

548
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:28,439
But <i>Signor</i> Caruso,
what happened?

549
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,733
This morning, by accident,
I make the big insult

550
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:32,318
to Mr. Benjamin and Miss Hagger.

551
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,028
You did?

552
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,239
So now I come to make the
apology and that I cannot do

553
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,490
because to make the apology

554
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,159
I must insult the old man again.

555
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:41,953
What did you say?

556
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,539
I called him Miss Hagger's papa.

557
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,748
[chuckles]

558
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,208
See, you laugh.

559
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,043
Everybody else laughed,
but he does not think

560
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,628
it is funny.

561
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,588
No, he wouldn't.

562
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:55,049
Maybe you help me.
You know him well?

563
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,051
Quite well.

564
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,594
He's my father.

565
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,889
<i>Mama-mia.</i>.

566
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,891
[speaking in foreign language]

567
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,314
[instrumental music]

568
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,205
Carrying the house?

569
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:28,583
No, I'm nervous,
all these people.

570
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,877
Why the galleries go
clear the sky.

571
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,880
[music continues]

572
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:40,136
Forget the galleries. Only
the Diamond Horseshoe counts.

573
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,889
They're patron and critic.
Judge and jury.

574
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,515
I do not like it.

575
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,976
Diamonds are hard, cold
without the feeling.

576
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,103
When they like you they're
the most wonderful audience

577
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,772
in the world, and when
they cheer you, Enrico,

578
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:54,775
you're in the hall of fame,
immortal.

579
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,616
[singing in foreign language]

580
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:27,099
[singing in foreign language]

581
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,467
[singing continues]

582
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,742
[singing continues]

583
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:37,980
[audience applauding]

584
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,807
- Didn't you like him?
- No.

585
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,351
Neither him nor his performance.

586
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,354
It was a serious mistake
to sign him.

587
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,484
- "Caruso has the ex..."
- Exuberance.

588
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,904
"...of an Italian peasant."

589
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,366
"It is clear that
he is no Jean de Reszke"

590
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:33,369
Why should you copy de Reszke?
You are yourself.

591
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,371
It was enough
for the rest of the world.

592
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,124
That is enough for here.

593
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:41,168
- "Miss Hagger struggled va..."
- Valiantly.

594
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,379
"...to keep the performance
alive.

595
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:47,049
<i>Signor</i> Caruso, however,
was too much for her.

596
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:50,094
For the Diamond Horseshoe
used to the delicate polisher

597
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:54,723
Jean de Reszke, Caruso was too
bourgeois to be..."

598
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:57,726
[speaking in foreign language]

599
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,146
Enough! Please!

600
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:06,444
- I go out.
- I go with you, Enrico.

601
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:10,072
This time, my friends,
it is better that I be alone.

602
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:14,285
- Morning.
- <i>Signor</i> Benjamin live here?

603
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,287
- Yes, sir.
- I'm Caruso.

604
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,497
I was told I'd find
Gatti-Casazza here.

605
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,249
I'm sorry but there's
an important--

606
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,793
This is important too.
I'll wait here.

607
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,795
I'll see what I can do, sir.

608
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:36,056
Giulio: Permit me to remind you,
sir, that as director

609
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,184
of the Metropolitan,
I make up the casts.

610
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:40,978
And the best director
they've had, my dear Gatti.

611
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,772
That's why I'm sure you'll agree
that another performance

612
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:47,067
like last night and Miss Heggar
will be labeled with him

613
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:48,694
a failure.

614
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,696
I advise you to pull Caruso
out of the cast.

615
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,072
Louise: Park.
Park: Louise!

616
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:53,657
Park: Please,
let me handle this.

617
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:54,909
Louise: But this is
a terrible thing

618
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,327
to do to any artist

619
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,871
and Caruso is a great artist.

620
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,165
I thought he was very good.

621
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:04,001
My dear child, I permitted you
to stay and listen

622
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,920
in the hope
that you might learn.

623
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,964
What is it, Finch?

624
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,926
- There's a gentleman--
- I will tell you myself.

625
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,303
Gatti, I sing
no more in America.

626
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,514
What you have heard
is only Mr. Benjamin's opinion.

627
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:19,016
- Park: The critics agree with me.
- Frustrated musicians.

628
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,726
Can you say his performance
last night

629
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,603
was that of a nobleman?

630
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,356
- Now Jean de Reszke--
- It is foolish to compare.

631
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,525
The singing, yes,
but nothing else.

632
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:30,486
He is tall and I'm short,
he is old and I am young.

633
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:34,156
Park: He is a gentleman.
Enrico: And I'm a peasant.

634
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,116
I go now. I do not like fights.

635
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,952
Enrico.

636
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,454
- We talk things over later.
- There's nothing to talk about.

637
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,289
I've walked the city
from one end to the other

638
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:45,000
and I have decided.
I do not sing in America.

639
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:48,003
[instrumental music]

640
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:53,217
Well, <i>Signor</i> Benjamin, you have
just destroyed one singer

641
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,843
have you another one to give me?

642
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,679
- Park: Phone Jean de Reszke.
- Impossible.

643
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,305
He doesn't want to sing anymore.
He's retired.

644
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:00,140
He, he hasn't rehearsed.

645
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,142
For this emergency,
he will sing.

646
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,027
<i>Signorina</i> Doro.

647
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,115
I sit and cry with you please.

648
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:19,034
Oh, Caruso, I must apologize
for my father.

649
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:21,620
Maybe he was right.
The newspapers, the audience--

650
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:22,955
Oh, no.

651
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,915
No, you were wonderful.

652
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:27,710
[chuckles] Thank you, <i>piccina</i>.

653
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,588
That means little girl.

654
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,798
Ah! I thought it was going
to be easy

655
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:33,966
to conquer America

656
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,051
take it by the nose.

657
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:39,346
But it is not like Europe here.
It's a cold country.

658
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,140
Oh, no.

659
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:44,977
America is a big country
with a big heart.

660
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,021
Maybe it's like that tea
in London.

661
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,814
It takes time to get used to it.

662
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,108
[speaking in foreign language]

663
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,110
[mumbling]

664
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,947
- Goodbye, Miss Dorothy, I quit.
- Tullio.

665
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,657
Ballet or no ballet,
I have a right to my opinion.

666
00:51:58,741 --> 00:51:59,950
What happened now?

667
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,368
Your father asked me
what I thought

668
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,953
of the new tenor last night.

669
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:05,289
I said "Fine", so he gets mad

670
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,999
and calls me a stupid foreigner.

671
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,043
I was born in this country.

672
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,586
I am as good an American
as he is

673
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,338
and I know as much music.

674
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:14,131
- You like Caruso?
- Yes, I did.

675
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,550
- And the gallery sounded fine.
- But the Diamond Horseshoe--

676
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:17,926
There are more seats
in the gallery

677
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,303
and don't you forget it, mister.

678
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,971
Oh, that's what I meant.

679
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:22,473
This country is full of people

680
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,683
and most of them sit
in the galleries.

681
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:26,560
Sing for them, Mr. Caruso

682
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,270
and you'd like America.

683
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:30,814
- Caruso?
- Yes.

684
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:33,317
- Doesn't he like it here?
- They don't like me.

685
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,486
Well, what's your hurry?
You're only here two weeks.

686
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,655
Expect to be president already?

687
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:40,658
[laughing]

688
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:42,743
Did you ever dress
an opera singer?

689
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,245
Are they any different
from anyone else?

690
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,247
[laughing]

691
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:50,542
[vocalizing]

692
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,509
Good.

693
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,761
- You like this kind of work?
- <i>Si</i>.

694
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,222
- You like my friends?
- <i>Si</i>.

695
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,264
You like Tullio?

696
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:07,101
[speaking in foreign language]

697
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,686
- You keep the job.
- <i>Grazie</i>.

698
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:11,980
Snuff to clear the head.

699
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,365
Whiskey to relax the throat.

700
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:27,871
[vocalizing]

701
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,084
Water to wash down the whiskey.

702
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:38,882
- Man 1: Curtains, <i>Signor</i> Caruso.
- Ready.

703
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:40,884
My good luck piece.

[speaking in foreign language]

705
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:02,781
I'm ready.

706
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:07,453
I walk to the stage with you,
<i>amico</i>, for luck.

707
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:08,495
<i>Grazie</i>.

708
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,957
Tonight, you will hear
a performance

709
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,500
worthy of the Metropolitan.

710
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,504
Dorothy.

711
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:21,633
I'm sorry, father,
I was thinking...

712
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:24,094
Oh, my dear, Jean. What on earth
are you doing here?

713
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:26,555
- The curtain will be up.
- I'm not singing tonight.

714
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,432
- What?
- Caruso has changed his mind.

715
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,892
- It's outrageous.
- Oh, no.

716
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,310
Nothing of the kind.

717
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,145
I really did not want to sing,
you know.

718
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,105
It was just a favor to you.

719
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:37,274
And now, you must do me
a favor in return.

720
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,567
Anything.

721
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,110
Since I'm here, I may as well

722
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,904
listen to this young man, hm?

723
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,198
So, and, if you're having
no guests here tonight--

724
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,616
Delighted.

725
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,868
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

726
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,538
Ah, Dorothy, my child,
I am very glad to see you here.

727
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,457
Thank you, <i>monsieur</i>.

728
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,460
I'm very glad to see you here.

[audience applauding]

730
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,885
One last thing, Enrico.

731
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,804
Don't give so much,
the Diamond Horseshoe

732
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:08,639
prefers dignity to fashion.

733
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,349
Hold back a little.

734
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,310
And take your hands
out of your pockets.

735
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,939
No, Gatti, last time I tried
to play the gentleman.

736
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,817
I'm no gentleman,
so I do what you tell me.

737
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,860
But today I learned something,

738
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:24,780
America is full of people
who sit in the galleries

739
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,157
and I can sing for them.

740
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:31,787
Tonight I play a man who's cold,
without a penny and hungry.

741
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,456
Up in the galleries,
they know this man.

742
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,792
I know this man too.

743
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,252
He keeps his hands
in his pockets

744
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,587
whether the Diamond Horseshoe
likes it or not.

745

Caruso. Bravo, Caruso!

750
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,316
- Who is that?
- Jean de Reszke.

751
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,734
Jean de Reszke!

752
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,152
Now, they'll all cheer.

753
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:10,404

754
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,825

756
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:34,928
<i>Signorina</i> Doro,
so glad to find you.

757
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,430
What are you doing here alone?

758
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,764
Father went to get Miss Heggar.

759
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:40,225
I'm waiting for him.

760
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,436
You were wonderful, Mr. Caruso.

761
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,354
I thank you for it.

762
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:47,691
You were my good luck.
If not for you I run away.

763
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,776
And now I feel good
about the people

764
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,362
and the country and...

765
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,531
Already it feels
like home to me.

766
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,493
Doro, your hands are like ice.

767
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:00,537
In the excitement,
I lost my gloves.

768
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,164
Oh, here, take mine.

769
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,124
Man 2: We want to hear you sing,
Mr. Caruso.

770
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,334
Mr. Caruso,
wanna hear you sing, please.

772
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,635
No more ticket.
Can you now sing for us?

773
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,429
No more ticket.
Sing for one song, please.

774
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,597
You could not get in?

775
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,682
No, we couldn't get any seats.

776
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:21,975
I sing.

Hold it.

Thanks. That's a pip.

I'm from "The Globe."

<i>Un, momento, eh</i>?

809
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,762
I don't need you until tonight.

- I take it.

- Merry Christmas, Ms. Dorothy.
- Merry Christmas, maestro.

- Is your father coming?
- No, he's busy.

01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,648
But he sent these
for the office staff.

835
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,859
Do it later. Come.

838
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:09,823
I didn't get a present.

839

- You do not know me?
- Of course, I do.

Even behind that beard
I recognize the Caruso voice.

847
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,718
The voice. But you forget me.

848

The little <i>piccina</i> has grown up.

01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:35,014
Uh, <i>Signor</i> Caruso,
may I have that interview now?

01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:36,433
Uh, no, later.

851
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:39,227
Just a few lines
to go with the pictures?

852
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,354
It's my first assignment.
You promised.

853
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:44,649
I get out of this.

854
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:47,026
We talk as we go.

855
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,696
Doro, you promise you wait
for me?

856
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:50,738
Please?

857
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:53,867

Maybe you're surprised,
we end up here

865
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,347
instead of The Ritz.

866
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:17,515

877
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,409
You must feed her good
because she is hungry

They seem very nice.

My mama and papa were
just like them.

887
01:06:57,305 --> 01:07:01,184
Fine people. You would think so,
but your papa, no.

888
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,645
They're many things I like
that father doesn't.

889

So glad.

890
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,567
Doro, you see,
I want to marry you.

891
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:14,989
Please say something, Doro.

892
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,910
I don't know what to say.

893
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,412
- I-- I make you mad I ask?
- Oh, no.

894
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:25,166
But how do you know your mind
so quickly?

895
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:28,086
Oh, I think I know it since you
were in a <i>piccina</i> in school.

896
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:31,256
So I wait till you grow up,
and now you are grown up.

before I go crazy.

I think I fell in love with you

903
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:01,786
- I will talk to your papa.
- Oh, no.

904
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:04,414
I think it'd best
if I talk to him alone first.

905

Oh, he will find objections
and talk you down.

much trouble with father.

Father, can't Louise take my

01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,342
Out of the question. It would

like a model hostess,

- You are on his side.
- No. Yours.

That's why I beg you,
don't rush into this.

Don't do it because

I know I'll be happy,
and I believe him

971
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:41,464
Of course, he does.
And why shouldn't he?

think of the voice?

Mm, a little too early to tell.

1242

One thing I guarantee,
she won't be a tenor.

1243
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:23,473
But she has my throat.
I look already.

but her throat
is exactly like mine.

1249

Mr. Caruso,

1250
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:43,243

to leave that baby alone.

- Everybody.

that's my big surprise

1261
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:18,653

he just called.

1262
01:34:18,736 --> 01:34:21,072
- Did he?
- Yes, just this minute.

1263
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:24,450
I told him he has a very pretty
little granddaughter.

1264

Is he coming to see her?

1265
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:29,581
Well, he has a cold
and a sore throat too.

1266
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:32,083
He said maybe it is better
he wait.

01:44:21,797 --> 01:44:23,924
Get, get Gatti.

1409
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:28,012
Curtain, <i>Signor</i> Caruso.

1410
01:44:32,475 --> 01:44:34,810
[instrumental music]

1411
01:44:34,894 --> 01:44:35,853
Ready.

1412
01:44:37,938 --> 01:44:40,441
You can't go on, I won't let
you. Wait for the doctor.

1413
01:44:40,524 --> 01:44:43,527
It's nothing, Doro.
I brush my teeth too hard.

1414
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:45,738
Darling, I beg you, don't sing.

1415
01:44:45,821 --> 01:44:48,908
My voice is not gone,
why shouldn't I sing?

1416
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:50,409
I won't let you.

1417
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:54,538
Oh, Doro...

1418
01:44:54,622 --> 01:44:58,793
long ago when I was very little,
I was frightened like you are.

1419
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:01,212
I did not want to sing
in the procession

1420
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:04,048
and my mother said,
"Enrico, the good God

1421
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:07,218
spared you for your voice."
she believed that,

1422
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:08,886
I believe it too.

1423
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:10,721
He's always taken care of me

1424
01:45:10,805 --> 01:45:13,140
and He'll take care of me
tonight.

1425
01:45:13,224 --> 01:45:14,683
Be my good Doro.

1426
01:45:14,767 --> 01:45:16,393
Go back now,
so the audience will see you

1427
01:45:16,477 --> 01:45:18,270
and know that all is well.

1428
01:45:18,354 --> 01:45:21,649
I will look and I know
it's all well too.

1429
01:45:21,732 --> 01:45:23,651
Please go.

1430
01:45:39,542 --> 01:45:42,127
Madonna <i>mia</i>,
stretch out your hand tonight

1431
01:45:42,211 --> 01:45:44,129
and help me.
