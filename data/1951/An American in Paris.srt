1
00:01:47,534 --> 00:01:49,411
This is Paris.

2
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,080
And I'm an American
who lives here.

3
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,831
My name, Jerry Mulligan...

4
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:55,750
... and I'm an ex-G.I.

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,297
In 1945, when the Army
told me to find my own job...

6
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:00,547
... I stayed on.

7
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:02,091
And I'll tell you why.

8
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:03,718
I'm a painter.

9
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:06,929
All my life that's all
I've ever wanted to do.

10
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,891
For a painter,
the mecca of the world for study...

11
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:11,934
... for inspiration and for living...

12
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:17,107
... is here on this star called Paris.

13
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:18,859
Just look at it.

14
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:22,488
No wonder so many artists
have come here and called it home.

15
00:02:22,738 --> 00:02:27,493
Brother, if you can't paint in Paris,
give up and marry the boss' daughter.

16
00:02:27,743 --> 00:02:31,956
We're on the Left Bank now.
That's where I'm billeted.

17
00:02:32,207 --> 00:02:34,125
Here's my street.

18
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,752
In the past couple of years...

19
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:38,129
... I've gotten to know
practically everyone on the block.

20
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:41,090
And a nicer bunch
you'll never meet.

21
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:44,135
Back home everyone
said I didn't have any talent.

22
00:02:44,385 --> 00:02:46,596
They might be saying
the same thing over here...

23
00:02:46,846 --> 00:02:49,475
... but it sounds better in French.

24
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:52,895
I live upstairs.

25
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,107
No, not there.

26
00:02:56,357 --> 00:02:58,943
One flight up.

27
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:34,211
Jerry!

28
00:04:35,504 --> 00:04:36,922
Those are three of my pals.

29
00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:40,258
Etienne, Maurice and Jacques.

30
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:45,555
I'm their man because
I give them American bubble gum.

31
00:04:46,014 --> 00:04:48,892
I have a lot of
good friends in Paris.

32
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:51,562
A lot of very good friends.

33
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:53,314
And I am one of them.

34
00:04:53,564 --> 00:04:55,358
Adam Cook is my name.

35
00:04:55,608 --> 00:04:56,943
I'm a concert pianist.

36
00:04:57,193 --> 00:05:01,280
That's a pretentious way of
saying I'm unemployed at the moment.

37
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:06,786
I live in the same brick pile
with young Rembrandt.

38
00:05:07,538 --> 00:05:08,747
That's not me.

39
00:05:08,997 --> 00:05:10,749
He's too happy.

40
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:12,376
I'm here on a scholarship.

41
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:16,171
Last year, I won the Hackenwall prize
and was sent abroad to study.

42
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:19,550
That's the eighth fellowship I've won.
And you know something?

43
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,635
I'm getting pretty homesick.

44
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:28,143
Not only that, but I'm beginning to feel
like the world's oldest child prodigy.

45
00:05:29,477 --> 00:05:33,189
One time I ran out of fellowships
and had to go to work for a living.

46
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,859
I had to stop because
I discovered I liked it...

47
00:05:36,109 --> 00:05:39,737
... and I didn't want to become
a slave to the habit.

48
00:05:39,988 --> 00:05:41,990
It's not a pretty face, I grant you.

49
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:47,371
But underneath its flabby exterior
is an enormous lack of character.

50
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:49,165
I like Paris.

51
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,250
It's a place where you don't
run into old friends.

52
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,503
Although that's never
been one of my problems.

53
00:05:54,753 --> 00:05:58,382
Strangely enough, I made a friend
over here once. I worked for him.

54
00:05:58,632 --> 00:06:00,385
His name was Henri Baurel.

55
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:02,971
You know, the French music hall star?

56
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:05,849
Do you remember him?

57
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:09,519
I do, because that's me.

58
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:13,732
Adam was a fine accompanist.
I wish he were still with me.

59
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:18,070
My, how nice to be
in the old quarter!

60
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:22,200
You see?
Everybody recognizes me.

61
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:24,243
I guess I haven't changed
so much after all.

62
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:26,496
They've known me a long time.

63
00:06:26,746 --> 00:06:28,289
But now, don't misunderstand.

64
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:30,374
I don't mean
to imply that I am old.

65
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,377
I'm not.
After all, I am only...

66
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:36,256
Well, what's the difference?

67
00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:40,844
No, that's not me.
I am not that young.

68
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:42,346
Let's just say...

69
00:06:42,596 --> 00:06:46,934
... I am old enough to know what to do
with my young feelings.

70
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:49,770
Right?

71
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:56,569
- Georges!
- Henri Baurel!

72
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:06,079
- Henri!
- Mathilde!

73
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:20,010
Adam?

74
00:07:34,568 --> 00:07:36,278
You used to
sing it a tone higher.

75
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:39,197
I'm a big boy now.
My voice is changing.

76
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:41,658
- Shall I come up?
- No, I'll be right down.

77
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:45,163
Hey, Georges,
some coffee!

78
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:50,751
Henri, I'm going to
make you an "omelette á la confiture".

79
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:54,464
Don't kiss me.
You'll spoil my makeup.

80
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:55,715
You look great, Hank.

81
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:57,675
What're you doing?
Taking injections?

82
00:07:57,925 --> 00:07:59,135
Something much better.

83
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:00,470
I hear your show's a big hit.

84
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,140
It is, "naturellement".

85
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,850
- When did you get over?
- Last March.

86
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,351
I phoned you,
but there was no answer.

87
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:08,812
I'd have phoned again, but I was
afraid you might be in.

88
00:08:09,062 --> 00:08:10,898
March? I wasn't in Paris then.

89
00:08:11,148 --> 00:08:14,776
Lise and I were
visiting friends in Juan-les-Pins.

90
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:18,489
- Some coffee, please.
- What are you working on?

91
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,034
- Same old concert.
- When will you give it?

92
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:24,954
When I can't figure out
any more reasons not to.

93
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:27,707
Some coffee, please.

94
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:31,461
I took Lise to hear
Weingarten play the other night.

95
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:35,173
It was her first concert,
and her eyes were shining two days.

96
00:08:35,423 --> 00:08:38,594
Why didn't you take her to an eye
doctor? Incidentally, who's Lise?

97
00:08:38,844 --> 00:08:40,554
That's the second time
that name has come up.

98
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:43,015
Adam, I am very happy these days.

99
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:44,350
I'll show you her picture.

100
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,352
- Are you married?
- Not yet.

101
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:48,437
Pretty. Very pretty.

102
00:08:48,687 --> 00:08:51,690
- She looks familiar.
- She's Jacques Bouvier's daughter.

103
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:54,861
Jacques Bouvier?

104
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,326
My coffee.

105
00:09:04,037 --> 00:09:06,373
Poor Jacques.
He was caught in the Resistance.

106
00:09:06,623 --> 00:09:10,085
I took care of Lise all through
the occupation. She lived in my house.

107
00:09:10,335 --> 00:09:11,462
Your house?

108
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:12,880
Shocking, but generous.

109
00:09:13,131 --> 00:09:14,590
She was a little girl then.

110
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:18,302
We only became
in love after she left.

111
00:09:18,553 --> 00:09:20,179
She's a little young for you,
isn't she?

112
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:22,640
No, not really. She's 19.

113
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,725
She's getting on.
What's she like?

114
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:28,105
Well, she has great vitality
and "joie de vivre".

115
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:32,276
She loves to go out, have fun and
dance. She could dance all night.

116
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:34,444
Sounds tiresome.
Kind of a wild kid, huh?

117
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:37,906
Wild?
Whatever gave you that idea?

118
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:39,366
No, she's very simple.

119
00:09:39,616 --> 00:09:41,243
Very simple.

120
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:44,246
She works all day at the
Maison Nicole, the perfume shop.

121
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:47,083
I prefer not to
discuss the matter any further.

122
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,918
Be serious.

123
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:51,212
She's an enchanting girl, Adam.

124
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:57,177
Not really beautiful,
and yet, she has great beauty.

125
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:18,616
Very spiritual type, huh?

126
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:19,950
Not at all.

127
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:23,914
She's an exciting girl, Adam.

128
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,104
She seems to be
a lusty young lady.

129
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,775
No! She's sweet and shy.

130
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,791
An old-fashioned girl, huh?

131
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,292
Course not!

132
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:11,380
She's vivacious and modern.

133
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:19,264
Always yakking it up?

134
00:11:19,514 --> 00:11:23,810
Don't be silly!
She reads incessantly.

135
00:11:54,634 --> 00:11:56,178
Doesn't all that reading
make her moody?

136
00:11:56,428 --> 00:12:01,516
Never.
She's the gayest girl in the world.

137
00:12:40,642 --> 00:12:44,687
Look, let's start
all over again, shall we?

138
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:47,982
What's she like?

139
00:12:49,818 --> 00:12:51,069
Good morning, Therese.

140
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:52,403
How are you today, "monsieur"?

141
00:12:52,654 --> 00:12:54,155
I could be better, Therese.
I'm broke.

142
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:56,449
- Broke?
- That means I have no money.

143
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,079
When I'm broke I don't eat.
Then I get tired and depressed.

144
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:02,915
When that happens, the only thing
that helps is wine and women.

145
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:05,960
That should be very simple.
You are in Paris.

146
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,128
But even in Paris
that takes money...

147
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:12,758
...which is what
I don't have in the first place.

148
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:14,886
This isn't music!

149
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:17,305
It's uncivilized.
It's noise.

150
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:19,349
- Hi!
- Hi.

151
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,352
Jerry, this is Henri Baurel.
Jerry Mulligan.

152
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,020
How do you do?
I know you.

153
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:26,481
I've heard you sing a thousand times.
You're wonderful.

154
00:13:26,731 --> 00:13:27,732
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

155
00:13:27,983 --> 00:13:29,818
Do you have
300 francs on you?

156
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:31,946
I'm going to Montmartre.
I need lunch money.

157
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:34,782
Sorry. Bought a postage stamp
and it broke me.

158
00:13:35,032 --> 00:13:35,992
Please allow me.

159
00:13:36,242 --> 00:13:37,243
No, thanks.

160
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:40,204
I never touch a guy
unless I've known him 15 minutes.

161
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:45,334
I've known him 15 years.
Lend me 300.

162
00:13:47,837 --> 00:13:51,216
I wouldn't lend him money if I were
you. He's a bum risk.

163
00:13:51,466 --> 00:13:55,554
Adam! For this you win a scholarship?

164
00:13:55,804 --> 00:13:58,348
What's the matter?
Evidently the man doesn't like jazz.

165
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:00,225
- He's against it.
- What else is there?

166
00:14:00,476 --> 00:14:04,188
I know what he likes.
He's strictly a three-quarter man.

167
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:05,564
Old Vienna.

168
00:14:05,814 --> 00:14:08,067
Franz Josef!

169
00:14:08,318 --> 00:14:10,945
The Palace of Schönbrunn.

170
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:13,958
- Kaffee with Schlagsahne.
- And Wienerschnitzel.

171
00:14:14,143 --> 00:14:16,359
Eine kleine nachtmusik.

172
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,460
The waltzes of Mittel Europa

173
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:24,361
They charm you and warm you within

174
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:26,462
While each day discloses

175
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:28,263
What Broadway composes

176
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:31,264
Is emptiness pounding on tin.

177
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,865
- Mein Herr!
- Mein Herr!

178
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:34,866
- Bitte, bitte!
- Denke, danke!

179
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:37,267
- Auf wiedersehen
- Auf wiedersehen

180
00:14:38,998 --> 00:14:40,668
How can I be civil

181
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,569
When hearing this drivel?

182
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,570
It's only for night-clubbing sauces

183
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:49,271
Oh give me the free 'n easy

184
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:53,272
Waltz that is Viennes-y

185
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:56,073
And go tell the band

186
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:57,874
If they want a hand

187
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,775
The waltz must be Strauss's

188
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:01,076
Strauss's

189
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:02,583
- Dog!
- Pig!

190
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:05,503
My card!

191
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,204
Ya ya ya

192
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:17,995
Give me oom pah pah

193
00:15:18,546 --> 00:15:24,099
When I want a melody

194
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,200
Lilting through the house

195
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:29,201
Then I want a melody

196
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:33,002
By Strauss

197
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:35,303
It laughs, it sings

198
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:37,304
The world is in rhyme

199
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:42,505
Swinging to three-quarter time

200
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:44,906
Mein kleine Liebchen!

201
00:15:45,357 --> 00:15:50,207
Let the Danube flow along

202
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,608
And The Fledermaus!

203
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:54,909
Keep the wine and give me song

204
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,210
By Strauss

205
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:01,411
By Jo, By Jing!

206
00:16:01,632 --> 00:16:04,012
By Strauss is the thing

207
00:16:04,293 --> 00:16:07,613
So I say to ha cha cha

208
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,514
- Heraus!
- Raus!

209
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:12,715
Just give me an oom pah pah

210
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:21,916
By Strauss!

211
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:26,517
When I want a melody

212
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:28,818
Lilting through the house

213
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,219
Then I want a melody

214
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,520
By Strauss

215
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:35,521
- It laughs
- Ha ha ha ha

216
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:38,222
- It sings
- La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

217
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:42,223
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

218
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:45,924
Let the Danube flow along

219
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:48,425
And The Fledermaus

220
00:16:48,526 --> 00:16:50,626
Keep the wine and give me song

221
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,127
By Strauss

222
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:54,428
By Jo, By Jing!

223
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:58,372
- Gentlemen!
- The Emperor!

224
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:48,073
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

225
00:17:48,224 --> 00:17:52,174
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

226
00:17:52,435 --> 00:17:56,275
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

227
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,175
By Strauss!

228
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:25,152
Relax, sister.
I'm from Perth Amboy, New Jersey.

229
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:29,782
I can see disregarding perspective
to achieve an effect, but I believe...

230
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:32,451
Why don't you be
a good little girl and move on?

231
00:19:32,702 --> 00:19:35,663
You won't buy anything.
You're just blocking out the sunshine.

232
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:38,041
I just wanted
to discuss your work.

233
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:40,419
I don't want you
to discuss my work.

234
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:43,255
I'm not interested
in your opinion of my work.

235
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:45,757
If you say something nice
I won't feel better...

236
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:47,176
...and if you don't
it'll bother me.

237
00:19:47,426 --> 00:19:50,762
Thank you. Good day.

238
00:19:52,598 --> 00:19:54,058
Do you mind if I look...

239
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:56,102
...or will you chew
my head off too?

240
00:19:56,352 --> 00:19:57,562
Go ahead.
You're okay.

241
00:19:57,812 --> 00:19:58,855
Thank you.

242
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:01,399
She's a third-year girl
that gripes my liver.

243
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:02,734
Third-year girls?

244
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:04,319
You know, American college kids.

245
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:07,405
They come here to take their third
year and lap up some culture.

246
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:08,948
They give me a swift pain.

247
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:10,700
Why?
They're harmless enough.

248
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,411
They're officious and dull.

249
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:18,000
They always make profound
observations they've overheard.

250
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:20,044
Say, do you have
a cigarette?

251
00:20:20,294 --> 00:20:22,963
- I think so.
- Thanks.

252
00:20:23,214 --> 00:20:25,049
Don't you like criticism?

253
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:30,305
Who does? Tough enough getting
it from those who know.

254
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:35,477
My first today.

255
00:20:35,727 --> 00:20:37,854
My guess is the business
isn't very good.

256
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:41,775
Your guess is
right on the nose.

257
00:20:52,787 --> 00:20:55,456
You know...

258
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,416
...I like these two.

259
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:59,377
Thanks. So do I.

260
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:02,630
I want to buy them.

261
00:21:02,755 --> 00:21:05,759
How much are they?

262
00:21:06,051 --> 00:21:07,344
Gee, I don't know.

263
00:21:07,594 --> 00:21:08,846
You don't know?

264
00:21:09,096 --> 00:21:13,183
I never thought I'd come to the point
where that would be an issue.

265
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:15,227
Offer me something.

266
00:21:15,477 --> 00:21:18,647
15,000 francs.

267
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:21,150
For each.

268
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:23,027
Will that be satisfactory?

269
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:25,697
That'll be
good and satisfactory.

270
00:21:25,947 --> 00:21:27,407
You sure you know what you're doing?

271
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:30,827
What do you care?

272
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:32,996
That's about $50 apiece,
isn't it?

273
00:21:33,246 --> 00:21:35,665
I don't know.
I haven't changed money lately.

274
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:36,875
Oh, dear!

275
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,713
- What's the matter?
- I haven't got enough with me.

276
00:21:40,963 --> 00:21:44,008
Come back tomorrow.
It's a cinch they'll still be here.

277
00:21:44,258 --> 00:21:47,553
Why don't you come to the hotel?
I can pay you there.

278
00:21:47,803 --> 00:21:49,221
Fine. Is it far?

279
00:21:49,471 --> 00:21:52,808
Would you care if it were?

280
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:00,567
- What's your name?
- Jerry Mulligan. Yours?

281
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:02,235
Milo Roberts.

282
00:22:02,485 --> 00:22:06,281
- Milo?
- Yeah, as in "Venus de".

283
00:22:06,531 --> 00:22:09,367
Venus de.

284
00:22:10,076 --> 00:22:13,456
Is this yours?

285
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:18,252
Maybe I should have
charged you more.

286
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,854
I'll be back.
Make yourself at home.

287
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:52,288
Here.

288
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,873
Thanks.

289
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:58,670
- Would you like some sherry?
- All right.

290
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,506
How'd you come by
these worldly possessions?

291
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,341
A rich husband or father?

292
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:04,634
A father.

293
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,846
- What's he do?
- Oil.

294
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:08,556
I should have known.

295
00:23:08,806 --> 00:23:10,307
Suntan oil.

296
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:13,686
Really? I didn't know
there was so much in that racket.

297
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:16,981
-There's a lot of red skin in America.
- There must be.

298
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:20,067
Let's see now.
Where shall I hang these?

299
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:21,527
Maybe over on...

300
00:23:21,777 --> 00:23:24,155
Here's a good place.
Good light.

301
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:25,866
Not too much sun.

302
00:23:26,116 --> 00:23:27,993
That'll be fine.

303
00:23:28,243 --> 00:23:30,620
By golly, you know, these are good!

304
00:23:30,871 --> 00:23:32,664
I've seen hundreds of paintings
by young artists...

305
00:23:32,914 --> 00:23:35,166
...and not one has
impressed me till these!

306
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:37,919
I'm glad.
Makes it easier to give up.

307
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:39,171
Give up?

308
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:42,550
It's kind of hard
for an artist to sell.

309
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,387
A writer, a composer can
buy a copy of what they create.

310
00:23:46,637 --> 00:23:48,723
With a painter,
it's the original that counts.

311
00:23:48,973 --> 00:23:51,267
Once that's gone,
it's out of his life.

312
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:54,020
I never thought of that.

313
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:57,316
Excuse me for a minute.

314
00:23:58,775 --> 00:24:00,068
Hello, Tommy.

315
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,612
No, dear.
Don't come up.

316
00:24:01,862 --> 00:24:04,531
Be a darling and wait
for me in the dining room.

317
00:24:04,781 --> 00:24:07,367
I'll be right down.

318
00:24:07,618 --> 00:24:09,286
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to stay long.

319
00:24:09,536 --> 00:24:11,288
Don't apologize.
I wanted you to.

320
00:24:11,538 --> 00:24:14,082
I wish we had more time to talk.

321
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:16,836
Goodbye, and thanks again.

322
00:24:17,086 --> 00:24:18,755
By the way...

323
00:24:19,005 --> 00:24:20,548
...what are you going to do tonight?

324
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:21,758
Why?

325
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:24,260
I'm giving
a small party here.

326
00:24:24,511 --> 00:24:27,222
There'll be an extra girl.
Why not come?

327
00:24:27,472 --> 00:24:28,431
I don't know.

328
00:24:28,681 --> 00:24:30,829
Do you have a date?

329
00:24:30,864 --> 00:24:32,978
Well, then come.

330
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:35,689
You'll find the company very easy.
Nothing formal.

331
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,567
- Be here at eight.
- Okay.

332
00:24:38,817 --> 00:24:43,489
My car can take you home.
He has nothing to do.

333
00:24:43,864 --> 00:24:46,492
Thanks.

334
00:24:58,213 --> 00:25:00,799
Me, me!

335
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:20,712
-Jerry, do you have any bubble gum?
No, je n'ai pas de buble gum.

336
00:25:21,503 --> 00:25:24,013
Demain, le buble gum pour tous.

337
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:29,454
"Demain." Tomorrow.

338
00:25:29,705 --> 00:25:32,858
It's good. Demain tomorrow.
Il parle l'anglais.

339
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:34,859
Jerry, parle anglais à nous!

340
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,860
-¿Parler anglais?
-Oui.

341
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,461
Ok! Ok! Silence, Silence!

342
00:25:39,562 --> 00:25:40,862
Faites attention!

343
00:25:41,103 --> 00:25:44,263
Écoutez! Je suis la professeure.

344
00:25:44,971 --> 00:25:48,224
- Répétez aprés moi. Door.
- Door!

345
00:25:48,474 --> 00:25:50,393
- Street.
- Street!

346
00:25:50,643 --> 00:25:52,687
- Lady.
- Lady!

347
00:25:52,937 --> 00:25:54,647
- Window.
- Window!

348
00:25:54,898 --> 00:25:57,110
- Flowers.
- Flowers!

349
00:25:57,511 --> 00:25:59,711
Bonjour! Nous sommes très intelligents.

350
00:26:00,012 --> 00:26:02,412
Nous parlons en anglais.

351
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:06,512
Ah monsieur le wise guy!

352
00:26:06,623 --> 00:26:08,413
Pour toi un mot très difficile.

353
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:10,372
A very hard word.

354
00:26:10,623 --> 00:26:12,984
-Massachussets.
-Massachussets.

355
00:26:13,925 --> 00:26:16,885
Alors, maintenant une chanson américaine.

356
00:26:17,172 --> 00:26:19,333
An American song.

357
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:20,334
Dis moi!

358
00:26:20,383 --> 00:26:22,221
- I got.
-  I got.

359
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,222
Bon.

360
00:26:23,723 --> 00:26:25,023
- I got.
- I got.

361
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,733
Good.

362
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:28,534
- I got.
- I got.

363
00:26:28,635 --> 00:26:30,835
- Tous ensemble.
- I got.

364
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:33,836
Bon. Et toujours la même
chose: "I got".

365
00:26:38,327 --> 00:26:40,637
- I got
- rhythm.

366
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,838
- I got
- music.

367
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:45,239
- I got
- my girl.

368
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,740
Who could ask for anything more?

369
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:53,041
- I got.  -I got
- daisies in green pastures.

370
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,942
- I got
- my girl.

371
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,543
Who could ask for anything more?

372
00:26:58,104 --> 00:27:00,044
Old Man Trouble,

373
00:27:00,545 --> 00:27:02,745
I don't mind him

374
00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:05,246
You won't find him

375
00:27:05,377 --> 00:27:07,847
'round my door.

376
00:27:08,048 --> 00:27:09,748
- Vous comprenez ça?
- Non.

377
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:12,449
- I got
- rhythm.

378
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,250
- I got
- music.

379
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:17,051
- I got
- my girl.

380
00:27:17,152 --> 00:27:19,552
Who could ask for anything more?

381
00:27:19,643 --> 00:27:21,953
Who could ask for anything more?

382
00:27:22,454 --> 00:27:24,954
La même chose en français.

383
00:27:27,555 --> 00:27:29,855
J'ai du rythme.

384
00:27:30,096 --> 00:27:32,356
J'ai de la musique.

385
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,057
J'ai ma chérie.

386
00:27:34,058 --> 00:27:36,758
Who could ask for anything more?

387
00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:39,659
J'ai the daisies

388
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,860
dans green pastures.

389
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:44,061
J'ai ma chérie.

390
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:46,662
Who could ask for anything more?

391
00:27:47,153 --> 00:27:49,163
Old Man Trouble,

392
00:27:49,564 --> 00:27:51,764
I don't mind him.

393
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:54,265
You won't find him

394
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,266
hanging 'round my door.

395
00:27:57,407 --> 00:27:59,267
- Vous comprenez ça, maintenant?
- Non!

396
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,668
- I got
- rhythm.

397
00:28:01,969 --> 00:28:04,369
- I got
- music.

398
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,970
- I got
- my girl.

399
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:08,771
Who could ask for anything more?

400
00:28:08,912 --> 00:28:12,272
Who could ask for anything more?

401
00:28:12,553 --> 00:28:14,473
La dance américaine.

402
00:28:23,574 --> 00:28:25,974
- C'est le time step.
-Le time step.

403
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:29,175
Ah, oui, le time step!

404
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,076
- C'est le Jim Jack
- Jim Jack.

405
00:28:35,235 --> 00:28:38,512
- Charleston!
- Charleston!

406
00:28:44,813 --> 00:28:46,713
- ¿Qu'est-ce ça?
- Je n'ai sais pas.

407
00:28:51,112 --> 00:28:55,146
- Choo-choo train!
- Choo-choo train!

408
00:29:00,511 --> 00:29:03,064
- Soldier!
- Soldier!

409
00:29:05,765 --> 00:29:07,365
Ça c'est un soldat.

410
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:13,942
Napoleon!

411
00:29:14,192 --> 00:29:17,028
- Cowboy!
- Cowboy!

412
00:29:18,196 --> 00:29:21,616
Hopalong Cassidy!

413
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:45,819
- Charlot!
- Charlie Chaplin!

414
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:54,368
Airplane!

415
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:02,969
Who could ask for anything more?

416
00:30:03,023 --> 00:30:05,197
More!

417
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:09,098
C'est tout.

418
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:11,599
- Au revoir!
- Au revoir, Jerry!

419
00:30:23,432 --> 00:30:26,560
- Good evening. I'm sorry I'm late.
- Good evening.

420
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,270
The moment I went to dress...

421
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,273
...the phone started ringing
like a steeple on Sunday.

422
00:30:31,523 --> 00:30:32,524
Would you like one of these?

423
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:34,276
Fine, fine.

424
00:30:34,526 --> 00:30:37,197
I've never seen so many
Americans in Paris before.

425
00:30:37,447 --> 00:30:40,659
The Champs Elysée looks
just like Main Street.

426
00:30:40,909 --> 00:30:42,410
Do you live here
all the time?

427
00:30:42,661 --> 00:30:48,583
I usually go home to Baltimore
for Christmas and Thanksgiving.

428
00:30:48,618 --> 00:30:52,212
That's quite a dress
you almost have on.

429
00:30:52,462 --> 00:30:54,757
- Thanks.
- What holds it up?

430
00:30:55,007 --> 00:30:56,092
Modesty.

431
00:30:56,342 --> 00:30:59,220
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

432
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,348
I see it's a formal brawl
after all.

433
00:31:02,598 --> 00:31:03,599
What makes you think that?

434
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:06,686
The more formal the party is,
the less you have to wear.

435
00:31:06,936 --> 00:31:09,814
No, you're quite wrong.
It's most informal.

436
00:31:10,064 --> 00:31:11,942
Where is everybody?

437
00:31:12,192 --> 00:31:13,402
Here.

438
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:15,654
Downstairs?

439
00:31:15,904 --> 00:31:18,949
No, here in this room.

440
00:31:19,074 --> 00:31:22,494
What about that extra girl?

441
00:31:22,744 --> 00:31:25,497
That's me.

442
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:29,502
- The party's you and me?
- That's right.

443
00:31:29,752 --> 00:31:33,131
I see. It's kind of
a little joke, isn't it?

444
00:31:33,381 --> 00:31:36,092
In a way.

445
00:31:37,385 --> 00:31:38,469
Well, lady...

446
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,931
...here's your dough back. I'll
take my pictures and run along.

447
00:31:42,181 --> 00:31:43,266
Wait a minute.

448
00:31:43,516 --> 00:31:44,684
Wait, my foot!

449
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:47,146
You must be
out of your mink-lined head!

450
00:31:47,396 --> 00:31:49,440
I know I need dough, but
I don't need it this badly.

451
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,983
If you're hard up for companionship...

452
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:53,235
...they have guys in town who
do this for a living.

453
00:31:53,485 --> 00:31:55,571
Call one of them.

454
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:56,822
What's so funny?

455
00:31:57,072 --> 00:31:59,825
You! You're so righteous.

456
00:32:00,075 --> 00:32:02,536
Stop defending your honor
so assiduously...

457
00:32:02,786 --> 00:32:04,664
...and listen to me for a minute.

458
00:32:04,915 --> 00:32:07,334
I don't need a paid escort.

459
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:11,504
And I'm not trying to rob you
of your precious male initiative.

460
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:14,841
I'm interested in your work
and want to know you better.

461
00:32:15,091 --> 00:32:16,551
Is that such a crime?

462
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,846
Well, it certainly is
a roundabout way to do it.

463
00:32:20,096 --> 00:32:24,435
Would you have accepted
a normal invitation?

464
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,561
I want to help you.

465
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:29,357
I think you have
a great deal of talent.

466
00:32:29,607 --> 00:32:32,318
It doesn't hurt to have
somebody rooting for you, does it?

467
00:32:32,568 --> 00:32:37,114
- It'll be the first time anybody ever did.
- Then let me.

468
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:39,952
Please?

469
00:32:42,204 --> 00:32:44,414
How's the food downstairs?

470
00:32:44,665 --> 00:32:47,417
- Very good.
- And probably very expensive.

471
00:32:47,668 --> 00:32:50,337
Would it embarrass you
if I signed the check?

472
00:32:50,587 --> 00:32:52,089
Let's go someplace I can afford.

473
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:55,217
How about the Café Flodair
on Montparnasse?

474
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:57,679
I feel like "jazz hot".
It's not expensive.

475
00:32:57,929 --> 00:32:59,389
It better not be.

476
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:04,143
I'd like to show a little profit
at the end of the day.

477
00:33:22,788 --> 00:33:24,373
How long did it last?

478
00:33:24,623 --> 00:33:26,417
About two years.

479
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:28,043
I lost him in the war.

480
00:33:28,294 --> 00:33:29,712
I'm sorry.

481
00:33:29,962 --> 00:33:31,798
To another woman.

482
00:33:32,048 --> 00:33:34,175
Somebody he met in California
while he was in training.

483
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:36,094
If he was the dog you
said he was...

484
00:33:36,344 --> 00:33:37,971
...you must have been glad
to be rid of him.

485
00:33:38,221 --> 00:33:40,265
I was, I guess, except that I...

486
00:33:40,515 --> 00:33:42,851
Except it would have been
more satisfactory...

487
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:44,311
...if you could have kissed him off.

488
00:33:44,561 --> 00:33:45,645
I guess.

489
00:33:45,896 --> 00:33:48,024
You should get married again.
You need it.

490
00:33:48,274 --> 00:33:49,400
- Why?
- Everybody does.

491
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,527
Everybody must
have someone to account to.

492
00:33:51,777 --> 00:33:54,655
Especially when you don't work.
It keeps the personality together.

493
00:33:54,906 --> 00:33:56,574
No, thank you.
Not for me.

494
00:33:56,824 --> 00:33:58,993
- Besides, I have work to do.
- What?

495
00:33:59,243 --> 00:34:01,120
Well, for the moment, you.

496
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,664
I want to bring you
to the attention of dealers.

497
00:34:03,915 --> 00:34:06,084
They know me.
I'm a big customer.

498
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,920
We have a large collection at home.

499
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,963
I could sponsor you...

500
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,549
...talk about you, encourage you.

501
00:34:12,799 --> 00:34:16,178
When you've done enough canvases
I could arrange your first show.

502
00:34:16,428 --> 00:34:18,555
That is, if you'll let me.

503
00:34:18,805 --> 00:34:21,350
It sounds great,
but what's in it for you?

504
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,854
Just the excitement of
helping somebody I believe in...

505
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:28,441
...and finding out if I'm right.

506
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,319
- Milo, darling.
- Tommy! I knew you'd turn up here.

507
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,779
This is Jerry Mulligan.

508
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:36,532
This is Tommy Baldwin.
He's on the "Paris Telegram".

509
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:40,329
Milo, I'm showing the Jansens
around and need your help.

510
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,498
What do you say?
Shall we go to his rescue?

511
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:43,707
Anything you like.

512
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:48,712
Follow me. You need radar to
find your way in this smoke.

513
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:57,722
- Who are the Jansens?
- Magazine illustrators.

514
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:01,601
- What're they like?
- Death.

515
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:09,025
- Look what I found.
- What a pleasant surprise!

516
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:13,154
- Jack, say hello to Milo.
- Hello, Milo.

517
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:15,324
This is Jerry Mulligan.
Jerry, the Jansens.

518
00:35:15,575 --> 00:35:16,701
How do you do?

519
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:21,247
Isn't this the chap you
told me about at lunch?

520
00:35:21,497 --> 00:35:23,791
Waiter, two more glasses, please.

521
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:25,918
Milo says you're quite wonderful.

522
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:27,712
I'd love to see
some of your pictures.

523
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:31,299
I'm having a private showing
tomorrow on a corner in Montmartre.

524
00:35:31,549 --> 00:35:32,885
You paint?

525
00:35:33,135 --> 00:35:35,554
So do we. Jack and I.
We work together.

526
00:35:35,804 --> 00:35:36,972
Well, that's cozy.

527
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:39,892
Dance, you two.
I want to talk to Milo.

528
00:35:40,142 --> 00:35:41,894
Come on, Jack.

529
00:35:42,144 --> 00:35:44,396
Have fun.

530
00:35:44,646 --> 00:35:48,442
There's a special doll over there.
Do you know who she is?

531
00:35:48,692 --> 00:35:51,571
No. But she is lovely,
isn't she?

532
00:35:51,821 --> 00:35:53,239
She sure is.

533
00:35:53,489 --> 00:35:55,742
I'm very anxious
for you to see Jerry's work.

534
00:35:55,992 --> 00:35:58,286
If you like it, you can get
him a mention on the art page.

535
00:35:58,536 --> 00:35:59,704
Nothing to it.

536
00:35:59,954 --> 00:36:01,247
- Lise.
- What?

537
00:36:01,497 --> 00:36:04,167
Her name is Lise.

538
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:08,881
Let's dance.
We haven't for years.

539
00:36:09,381 --> 00:36:12,259
Excuse me, Jerry.

540
00:36:21,602 --> 00:36:23,729
You're going to have trouble
with that one.

541
00:36:23,979 --> 00:36:27,484
No, I'm not.
He's just not housebroken yet.

542
00:36:27,734 --> 00:36:30,237
When will you stop involving
yourself with young artists?

543
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:31,947
It never works.

544
00:36:32,197 --> 00:36:34,866
If they're no good, you're ashamed.
If they are, they get too independent.

545
00:36:35,116 --> 00:36:36,743
Just dance, Tommy, please.

546
00:36:36,993 --> 00:36:39,079
All right. But I warn you,
he'll be out in four months...

547
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:43,125
...just like the composer
and the sculptor.

548
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:03,480
Lise! I didn't
see you sitting here!

549
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,148
What a pleasant surprise!

550
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:07,359
My wife and I were talking...

551
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:09,903
...and were wondering
what happened to her.

552
00:37:10,153 --> 00:37:14,449
Let's go around the floor
for old time's sake. Do you mind?

553
00:37:18,037 --> 00:37:20,081
You're certainly not
without your nerve!

554
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:23,376
Don't get angry.
This was perfectly harmless.

555
00:37:23,626 --> 00:37:27,213
I haven't been able to take
my eyes off you since I walked in.

556
00:37:27,463 --> 00:37:30,258
I only let you do this because
I didn't want a disturbance.

557
00:37:30,508 --> 00:37:31,926
And I don't have a wife.

558
00:37:32,176 --> 00:37:34,388
I threw that in to
make it look respectable.

559
00:37:34,638 --> 00:37:36,473
That was very considerate.

560
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:39,143
Please, I would like to
return to my table.

561
00:37:39,393 --> 00:37:42,146
In a minute.

562
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,078
I revise my estimate.

563
00:37:57,329 --> 00:38:00,498
Make that two months.

564
00:38:04,794 --> 00:38:07,631
This is the first time
I've done anything like this.

565
00:38:07,881 --> 00:38:11,761
At least as a civilian.
I just had to meet you.

566
00:38:12,011 --> 00:38:15,181
I don't know what type of girl
you think I am, but I'm not!

567
00:38:15,431 --> 00:38:18,017
And now I would like
to return to my friends.

568
00:38:18,267 --> 00:38:21,020
I thought you were bored with them.
You sure looked it.

569
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:24,398
You should see me now.

570
00:38:26,485 --> 00:38:28,779
The music has stopped.

571
00:38:29,029 --> 00:38:32,574
The elements are against me.

572
00:38:32,908 --> 00:38:36,453
It was swell seeing you again.
I'll tell Elaine to call you.

573
00:38:36,703 --> 00:38:38,372
What was your phone number?

574
00:38:38,622 --> 00:38:40,666
It slipped my mind
the moment you said it.

575
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,876
Opera 2-5-7-4.

576
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:46,839
No, Lise. 2-4-7-5.

577
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,842
Thank you.

578
00:38:49,968 --> 00:38:52,762
Good night.

579
00:39:01,564 --> 00:39:03,482
Well, I'm tired.
Good night.

580
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:05,317
Good night, darling.
I'll call you.

581
00:39:05,568 --> 00:39:06,777
Say good night to Milo.

582
00:39:07,027 --> 00:39:08,445
- Good night, Milo.
- Good night, Jack.

583
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:10,197
Don't I owe you something
for the wine?

584
00:39:10,447 --> 00:39:13,450
Forget it. You do it next time.
If there is one.

585
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:15,703
Good night.

586
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,873
Good night.

587
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:28,091
- That was fun, wasn't it?
- Was it?

588
00:39:28,341 --> 00:39:30,176
That's a fascinating place.

589
00:39:30,427 --> 00:39:32,178
I'd like to hang around
and paint it.

590
00:39:32,429 --> 00:39:34,514
I can imagine
all the work you'll get done.

591
00:39:34,764 --> 00:39:36,475
You've already painted
a Montmartre dive...

592
00:39:36,726 --> 00:39:38,728
...and it wasn't successful.
- Wait a minute.

593
00:39:38,978 --> 00:39:40,855
Don't tell me how
and what to paint.

594
00:39:41,105 --> 00:39:43,357
I didn't like
your exhibition tonight!

595
00:39:43,608 --> 00:39:44,692
I thought you were very rude.

596
00:39:44,942 --> 00:39:47,361
Rude? I didn't mean
to be. I'm sorry.

597
00:39:47,612 --> 00:39:49,322
Picking up stray women
is your own affair...

598
00:39:49,572 --> 00:39:52,199
...but don't do it with me.
Is that clear?

599
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,953
That's clear. That's very clear.
Stop the car.

600
00:39:55,203 --> 00:39:57,748
Sensitive artists!
You're touchy about yourself...

601
00:39:57,998 --> 00:39:59,458
...but oblivious of others.

602
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:01,501
You don't understand
how they feel.

603
00:40:01,752 --> 00:40:02,961
It's been fun.

604
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:04,713
Sorry you're stuck
with the pictures.

605
00:40:04,963 --> 00:40:09,176
- I still like the pictures.
- Thanks a lot.

606
00:40:24,234 --> 00:40:26,527
Jerry Mulligan.

607
00:40:26,778 --> 00:40:29,823
I met you at the Café Flodair
last night. Remember?

608
00:40:30,074 --> 00:40:31,450
You!

609
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,077
Yeah, me.

610
00:40:33,327 --> 00:40:36,538
It's a beautiful day and I thought
I could drop by and...

611
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:39,875
Well, now, one moment, Mr. Mooligan.

612
00:40:40,125 --> 00:40:41,168
Mulligan.

613
00:40:41,418 --> 00:40:42,962
Last night you were an annoyance.

614
00:40:43,212 --> 00:40:45,257
But today you're growing
into a nuisance.

615
00:40:45,507 --> 00:40:50,512
Now please leave me alone and don't
call me again, ever.

616
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:21,128
Good morning.

617
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,171
Good morning.

618
00:41:23,422 --> 00:41:24,506
Would you care for...

619
00:41:24,756 --> 00:41:27,175
No, thanks.
I've had my breakfast already.

620
00:41:27,426 --> 00:41:29,136
I've been up for hours...

621
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:31,513
...working, I might add, for you.

622
00:41:31,763 --> 00:41:33,724
Do you know Jules Parmentier,
the art dealer?

623
00:41:33,974 --> 00:41:34,933
I know of him.

624
00:41:35,183 --> 00:41:39,439
He came to the hotel
and had coffee this morning.

625
00:41:39,522 --> 00:41:42,191
I showed him your pictures.
He was very impressed.

626
00:41:42,442 --> 00:41:44,569
He thought you
had great individuality.

627
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:46,195
He thought they were fresh.

628
00:41:46,446 --> 00:41:48,031
- That's wonderful.
- Not only that...

629
00:41:48,281 --> 00:41:50,241
...but he wants to talk
about your show.

630
00:41:50,491 --> 00:41:52,952
- That's a long way off.
- Maybe not such a long way.

631
00:41:53,202 --> 00:41:55,331
I don't have near enough
for an exhibition.

632
00:41:55,581 --> 00:41:58,208
- What I do have, I'm not sure...
- That's not important.

633
00:41:58,459 --> 00:42:01,670
Then I went to the Marais Galleries
and talked to Louis Dufond.

634
00:42:01,921 --> 00:42:03,464
He's a very old friend of mine.

635
00:42:03,714 --> 00:42:07,092
He's coming tomorrow
to see your pictures.

636
00:42:07,343 --> 00:42:11,680
You don't waste any time, do you?

637
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:15,352
I hope not.

638
00:42:15,977 --> 00:42:19,189
Come with me and we'll
talk about it over lunch?

639
00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:22,108
I've something to do
this morning...

640
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:23,818
...but I could meet you.

641
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:27,072
How about the Restaurant Paul
on the Avenue de la Paix?

642
00:42:27,322 --> 00:42:30,660
I'll see you there at one.

643
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,789
I'm sorry about that
little tiff last night.

644
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:37,917
I was tired I guess.

645
00:42:38,167 --> 00:42:39,919
Forget it.

646
00:42:40,169 --> 00:42:44,507
- I did.
- You did? That's not very nice of you.

647
00:42:44,757 --> 00:42:47,636
See you at one.

648
00:43:02,985 --> 00:43:06,531
Very nice for a summer perfume.

649
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:12,453
This is a little heavy.

650
00:43:12,704 --> 00:43:14,706
I'll show you something else.

651
00:43:14,956 --> 00:43:17,041
What's that one on the right?

652
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:21,170
- This one?
- No, the other.

653
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:25,259
This is very nice.
It's called...

654
00:43:25,509 --> 00:43:27,886
It's called Escapade.

655
00:43:28,137 --> 00:43:31,682
There's a saleslady free at the
other end of the shop, "monsieur".

656
00:43:31,932 --> 00:43:34,560
Thank you, but what I want
is at this end.

657
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:38,689
I don't know which to choose.
They're both lovely.

658
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,900
I wish my husband were here.

659
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:43,486
He's so fussy about the way I smell.

660
00:43:43,737 --> 00:43:46,489
Why don't you bring him later
and decide then?

661
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,033
That's an excellent idea.

662
00:43:48,283 --> 00:43:50,535
He's in Milwaukee.

663
00:43:50,785 --> 00:43:53,496
Dear, oh, dear.
I hate decisions.

664
00:43:53,747 --> 00:43:56,834
I always get a rash if I
have to decide something.

665
00:43:57,084 --> 00:43:58,544
Let me help you.

666
00:43:58,794 --> 00:44:00,630
I'd have the man's point of view.

667
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,007
Yes, that's a good idea. Here.

668
00:44:03,257 --> 00:44:06,636
See which one you like.

669
00:44:07,637 --> 00:44:10,389
Not bad.

670
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,142
This is it.

671
00:44:13,392 --> 00:44:15,270
"Nuit d'Amour." Night of Love.

672
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,397
- No contest, lady.
- Really?

673
00:44:17,648 --> 00:44:21,443
Wear that and the Frenchmen will
never let you go back to Milwaukee.

674
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:22,945
I'll take it.

675
00:44:23,195 --> 00:44:25,656
Would you send it to my hotel,
collect?

676
00:44:25,906 --> 00:44:30,285
I'm Mrs. Edna Mae Benstrom.
I'm at the Granville.

677
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:32,038
Here's my card.

678
00:44:32,288 --> 00:44:33,414
Thank you.

679
00:44:33,665 --> 00:44:36,626
I think I'll put a little on.

680
00:44:36,876 --> 00:44:38,628
It is good, isn't it?

681
00:44:38,878 --> 00:44:40,338
You'll need protection.

682
00:44:40,588 --> 00:44:42,423
I hope so.

683
00:44:42,674 --> 00:44:45,093
You've been very kind.
Thank you.

684
00:44:45,343 --> 00:44:47,136
Thank you both. Good day.

685
00:44:47,387 --> 00:44:48,973
Good day.

686
00:44:49,223 --> 00:44:51,308
Now, "monsieur", what
can I do for you?

687
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:54,228
You know what you can do
for me. Go out with me.

688
00:44:54,478 --> 00:44:55,938
How do you know I'm not married?

689
00:44:56,188 --> 00:44:59,942
That finger on your left
hand is awfully naked.

690
00:45:00,192 --> 00:45:02,987
It's a pity you don't have as much
charm as persistence.

691
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:05,531
I do. You've only seen
my aggressive side.

692
00:45:05,782 --> 00:45:08,159
I have a lighter side.
I'm loaded with charm.

693
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:11,496
I go to parties, put on hats
and do funny things.

694
00:45:11,746 --> 00:45:15,292
You see? What do you say?
Come on.

695
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:18,169
All right. You win.

696
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,338
You can take me for lunch.

697
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:23,217
I can't. How about dinner?

698
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:24,844
No. That's not possible.

699
00:45:25,094 --> 00:45:26,554
You have a date?

700
00:45:26,804 --> 00:45:31,642
What about after dinner?
Say, nine o'clock?

701
00:45:32,226 --> 00:45:33,936
I guess it would be all right.

702
00:45:34,186 --> 00:45:38,065
- I'll pick you up.
- No. I'll meet you somewhere.

703
00:45:38,316 --> 00:45:40,067
Do you know the Café Bel-Ami?

704
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:41,653
By the bridge?

705
00:45:41,903 --> 00:45:46,158
- I'll see you there at nine.
- Fine.

706
00:45:46,783 --> 00:45:50,037
There is no happier man in Paris
than "Monsieur" Mulligan.

707
00:45:50,287 --> 00:45:53,206
At this moment.

708
00:46:07,388 --> 00:46:11,142
Madame, you're delicious!

709
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:37,087
One's company, two's a crowd.
You get it?

710
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,969
Disappear!
Don't you see I'm busy?

711
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:45,347
Hit the boulevard!

712
00:46:45,588 --> 00:46:47,648
Tra-la-la-la

713
00:46:47,749 --> 00:46:50,149
Tra-la-la-la

714
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,650
This time it's really love
Tra-la-la-la

715
00:46:54,851 --> 00:46:59,551
I'm in that blue above
Tra-la-la-la

716
00:46:59,732 --> 00:47:03,952
She fills me full of joy
Tell me, papa.

717
00:47:04,173 --> 00:47:08,353
Am I not a lucky guy?
Tra-la-la-la

718
00:47:08,704 --> 00:47:12,854
Just listen to my heart
Go pitterpatter

719
00:47:13,225 --> 00:47:17,355
It's started from the start
I've fallen like that

720
00:47:17,606 --> 00:47:20,656
Humming, strumming, singing, drumming
What a thrill!

721
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:25,057
I'm getting from it all
La-la-la  La-la-la

722
00:47:26,938 --> 00:47:30,858
This time it's really love!
Tra-la-la-laLa-la-la

723
00:47:31,019 --> 00:47:35,059
To me you're fu-full of
bla-bla-bla-bla!

724
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,460
I've got the grandest love,
Dites- moi, papa!

725
00:47:39,641 --> 00:47:43,661
Cherchez la femme toujours.
Ooh-la-la!  Oui!

726
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:45,962
She's got but ev'rything.

727
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:48,263
Is there a doury?

728
00:47:48,374 --> 00:47:52,564
- She's like a breath of spring.
- Wow, you'll be soury!

729
00:47:52,635 --> 00:47:54,565
Humming, strumming, singing, drumming.

730
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:00,466
- Nothing good to happen from the start!
- Tra-la-la-la La-la-la

731
00:48:37,923 --> 00:48:41,009
Look! One hand.

732
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:05,710
Rock! Rock, sinful dock!
Swing your pas with the tra-la-la.

733
00:49:44,751 --> 00:49:45,811
- Coming!
- Coming!

734
00:49:46,002 --> 00:49:46,812
- Coming!
- Coming!

735
00:49:47,053 --> 00:49:47,813
- Singing!
- Singing!

736
00:49:48,114 --> 00:49:49,214
- Coming!
- Singing!

737
00:49:49,215 --> 00:49:54,615
What a thrill!
I'm getting from it all

738
00:49:54,616 --> 00:50:02,416
Tra-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la!

739
00:50:06,217 --> 00:50:07,417
Tu sais bien que je t'aime.

740
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:13,482
- Allò.
- Hello. What's new?

741
00:50:13,732 --> 00:50:14,900
Who is this?

742
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,944
- Guess.
- Oh, Adam!

743
00:50:17,194 --> 00:50:19,614
You always call at the wrong moment.

744
00:50:19,864 --> 00:50:23,117
Wrong moment? You make me feel
like a rejected child.

745
00:50:23,368 --> 00:50:25,453
When's the new number
going into the show?

746
00:50:25,703 --> 00:50:27,497
The new number goes in tonight.

747
00:50:27,747 --> 00:50:29,332
What? Tonight, Henri?

748
00:50:29,582 --> 00:50:31,084
Yes, darling, tonight.

749
00:50:31,334 --> 00:50:33,628
Are you having a party?
Need an extra man?

750
00:50:33,878 --> 00:50:36,757
No, I was talking to Lise,
my dinner guest.

751
00:50:37,007 --> 00:50:39,510
Give me a rundown on that menu.

752
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,178
What're you having to eat?

753
00:50:41,428 --> 00:50:43,138
Magnificent pheasant.

754
00:50:43,389 --> 00:50:45,891
I can drop everything
and be up in ten minutes.

755
00:50:46,141 --> 00:50:47,935
That is, if I'm not intruding.

756
00:50:48,185 --> 00:50:52,398
No, no. I see you later at the cafe.
Goodbye.

757
00:50:52,648 --> 00:50:54,943
I'm hungry.

758
00:50:55,193 --> 00:50:57,112
That Adam.
He'll never change.

759
00:50:57,362 --> 00:51:00,365
What's the matter, darling?
Can't you come tonight?

760
00:51:00,615 --> 00:51:02,993
If you can't,
it's all right, darling.

761
00:51:03,243 --> 00:51:04,244
Don't worry.

762
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:09,249
- No. Of course, I want to come.
- You are a doll.

763
00:51:26,726 --> 00:51:29,021
Would you...

764
00:51:29,271 --> 00:51:32,274
Yes, thank you.

765
00:51:33,734 --> 00:51:35,402
I wasn't sure you'd come.

766
00:51:35,652 --> 00:51:38,405
I thought maybe you said yes
to get rid of me.

767
00:51:38,655 --> 00:51:41,408
Not that it would have.

768
00:51:41,658 --> 00:51:44,911
What would you like?

769
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:48,791
Would you mind if we didn't sit here?

770
00:51:49,042 --> 00:51:53,129
- Why, no.
- Anything wrong, "monsieur"?

771
00:51:58,509 --> 00:51:59,636
I'm sorry.

772
00:51:59,886 --> 00:52:04,975
That's all right. I didn't feel
like sitting there anyhow.

773
00:52:11,607 --> 00:52:13,275
Let's walk along the river.

774
00:52:13,525 --> 00:52:16,153
All right.

775
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,669
I have a big thing for this spot.

776
00:52:30,919 --> 00:52:32,754
One of these days
I'll paint it.

777
00:52:33,004 --> 00:52:35,340
You're a painter?

778
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:37,342
You don't look like a painter.

779
00:52:37,593 --> 00:52:40,346
There are those who'll say
I don't paint like one either.

780
00:52:40,596 --> 00:52:43,849
But that doesn't bother me.
Discouragement stimulates me.

781
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,852
That much about you, I know.

782
00:52:47,103 --> 00:52:48,854
Yes, you do, don't you?

783
00:52:49,105 --> 00:52:51,148
But mark me well,
one of these days...

784
00:52:51,399 --> 00:52:54,026
...the world will ring
with the name Mulligan.

785
00:52:54,277 --> 00:52:57,447
Picasso will be remembered
as the forerunner of Mulligan.

786
00:52:57,698 --> 00:53:02,077
This tree will be famous because
it was painted by Mulligan.

787
00:53:02,327 --> 00:53:05,163
And when will this
golden age of art be?

788
00:53:05,414 --> 00:53:08,375
Well, it's hard to say.
It's hard to say.

789
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:13,756
Civilization has a natural resistance
against improving itself.

790
00:53:14,007 --> 00:53:15,717
It might take quite a while.

791
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:19,220
Quite a while.

792
00:53:23,308 --> 00:53:25,685
- How do you feel now?
- Why?

793
00:53:25,935 --> 00:53:29,230
A moment ago you were acting like
the police were after you.

794
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,734
I was, wasn't I?

795
00:53:31,984 --> 00:53:33,986
Why?

796
00:53:34,236 --> 00:53:36,071
No. Never mind, never mind.

797
00:53:36,322 --> 00:53:38,741
Don't try to think up
what to tell me.

798
00:53:38,991 --> 00:53:43,412
I don't have to know.
It's your business.

799
00:53:43,495 --> 00:53:45,893
Candy. Would you like some?

800
00:53:45,928 --> 00:53:48,293
I couldn't eat a whole one.

801
00:53:48,543 --> 00:53:51,171
Go ahead. Try.

802
00:53:51,421 --> 00:53:54,257
The night's young.

803
00:53:54,507 --> 00:53:58,053
We should live dangerously.

804
00:54:13,152 --> 00:54:15,905
Tell me some more.

805
00:54:16,224 --> 00:54:18,184
Well...

806
00:54:18,435 --> 00:54:21,521
...in America,
Saturday night's the big night.

807
00:54:21,771 --> 00:54:24,107
No work, no school...

808
00:54:24,357 --> 00:54:27,861
...when you get home, no money.

809
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,073
And Sunday?
Is Sunday nice in America?

810
00:54:31,323 --> 00:54:35,036
In America, everybody
catches cold on Sunday.

811
00:54:35,286 --> 00:54:39,206
- Did you?
- Well, sometimes. Sometimes.

812
00:54:39,457 --> 00:54:43,419
What about you? Aren't you sick
of the life and times of Mulligan?

813
00:54:43,669 --> 00:54:47,631
I'd rather listen to you.
I don't like to talk about myself.

814
00:54:47,882 --> 00:54:50,760
- You'll have to get over that.
- Why?

815
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:53,012
With a binding like you've got...

816
00:54:53,262 --> 00:54:55,807
...people will want
to know what's in the book.

817
00:54:56,058 --> 00:54:57,392
What does that mean?

818
00:54:57,642 --> 00:55:00,896
Well, primarily, it means
you're a very pretty girl.

819
00:55:01,146 --> 00:55:03,523
- I am?
- Yes, you are.

820
00:55:03,774 --> 00:55:05,108
How do you know?

821
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:08,236
I heard it on the radio.

822
00:55:08,487 --> 00:55:10,238
Making fun with me.

823
00:55:10,489 --> 00:55:13,200
Doesn't everybody tell you that?

824
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:15,452
I haven't been out with many people.

825
00:55:15,702 --> 00:55:17,079
And always friends.

826
00:55:17,329 --> 00:55:21,292
Honey, believe me, I'm no enemy.

827
00:55:33,221 --> 00:55:35,723
I don't know if you're
a girl of mystery...

828
00:55:35,973 --> 00:55:39,060
...or just a still water
that doesn't run deep...

829
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:41,729
...but there's one
thing I can tell you.

830
00:55:41,979 --> 00:55:44,775
If I'd been around sooner,
you'd know by now that...

831
00:55:45,025 --> 00:55:46,777
...you're very pretty.

832
00:55:47,027 --> 00:55:51,073
And I'm not making fun with you.

833
00:55:55,474 --> 00:55:59,474
It's very clear

834
00:56:00,175 --> 00:56:05,575
Our love is here to stay

835
00:56:06,326 --> 00:56:10,976
Not for a year

836
00:56:11,377 --> 00:56:16,377
But ever and a day

837
00:56:16,858 --> 00:56:20,078
The radio

838
00:56:20,309 --> 00:56:23,279
And the telephone

839
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:28,380
And the movies that we know

840
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:33,181
May just be passing fancies

841
00:56:33,642 --> 00:56:38,882
And in time may go

842
00:56:39,773 --> 00:56:44,583
But oh my dear

843
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:50,384
Our love is here to stay

844
00:56:51,535 --> 00:56:56,185
Together we're

845
00:56:56,366 --> 00:57:02,186
Going a long, long way

846
00:57:02,537 --> 00:57:06,987
In time the rockies may crumble

847
00:57:07,148 --> 00:57:10,188
Gibraltar may tumble

848
00:57:10,949 --> 00:57:19,289
They're only made of clay but

849
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:31,990
Our love is here to stay

850
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:47,993
- What time is it?
- Eleven o'clock.

851
00:59:48,243 --> 00:59:50,287
- Eleven! I have to go.
- Where?

852
00:59:50,537 --> 00:59:52,915
- When will I see you again?
- I don't know.

853
00:59:53,166 --> 00:59:56,711
Lise, we have to
see each other again.

854
00:59:56,961 --> 00:59:59,172
Yes, we do, don't we?

855
00:59:59,422 --> 01:00:00,423
Tomorrow night.

856
01:00:00,673 --> 01:00:03,843
- No, I can't. How about lunch?
- No. I can't.

857
01:00:04,093 --> 01:00:06,429
Saturday morning I'm at
the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.

858
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:11,726
- I'm finished at noon. Meet me there?
- Saturday. Yes, I will.

859
01:00:23,727 --> 01:00:25,827
Une chançon

860
01:00:26,048 --> 01:00:28,028
C'est Paris, c'est Montmartre

861
01:00:28,029 --> 01:00:29,929
C'est Robinson

862
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,230
C'est le jour qui pende comme une chanson

863
01:00:34,531 --> 01:00:37,331
Car l'amour est là à mon coeur

864
01:00:37,532 --> 01:00:40,632
Oh quel grand bonheur!

865
01:00:41,903 --> 01:00:43,433
Jeaninne, comment ça va?

866
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:44,871
How are you?

867
01:00:45,272 --> 01:00:46,372
Excusez-moi, mes dames et messieurs!

868
01:00:46,473 --> 01:00:47,873
Mais c'est un ami americain.

869
01:00:49,114 --> 01:00:50,974
It's madness

870
01:00:51,155 --> 01:00:55,075
To be always sitting around in sadness. Oh!

871
01:00:55,216 --> 01:00:59,076
When you could be learning the Steps of Gladness?

872
01:00:59,277 --> 01:01:02,077
You'll be happy when you can do

873
01:01:02,278 --> 01:01:05,478
Just six or seven

874
01:01:05,859 --> 01:01:09,279
Begin today. You'll find it's nice

875
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:13,480
Have the quickest way to Paradise

876
01:01:13,811 --> 01:01:16,181
When you practice

877
01:01:16,462 --> 01:01:18,382
Here's the thing to do

878
01:01:18,553 --> 01:01:22,483
Simply say as you go

879
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:27,084
I'll build a Stairway to Paradise

880
01:01:27,335 --> 01:01:32,274
With a new Step ev'ry day

881
01:01:32,505 --> 01:01:36,405
I'm going to get there at any price

882
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:40,696
Stand aside, I'm on my way!

883
01:01:41,067 --> 01:01:43,097
I got the blues

884
01:01:43,248 --> 01:01:46,098
And up above it's so fair

885
01:01:46,279 --> 01:01:47,799
Shoes

886
01:01:47,911 --> 01:01:50,600
Go on and carry me there!

887
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:54,701
I'll build a Stairway to Paradise

888
01:01:55,022 --> 01:01:59,882
With a new Step ev'ry day

889
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:03,983
I'll build a Stairway to Paradise

890
01:02:04,434 --> 01:02:09,584
With a new Step ev'ry day

891
01:02:09,855 --> 01:02:13,785
I'm going to get there at any price

892
01:02:14,066 --> 01:02:17,986
Stand aside, I'm on my way!

893
01:02:18,567 --> 01:02:20,787
I got the blues

894
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:23,988
And up above it's so fair

895
01:02:24,409 --> 01:02:25,689
Shoes

896
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:28,790
Go on and carry me there!

897
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:32,991
I'll build a Stairway to Paradise

898
01:02:33,152 --> 01:02:37,552
With a new Step ev'ry day

899
01:02:37,843 --> 01:02:51,553
With a new Step ev'ry day

900
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:08,034
I am delighted.
It's a wonderful idea.

901
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,327
I'm so sorry.

902
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:11,038
Lise, I have wonderful news.

903
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:14,166
This, I take it, is the young
lady who'll do all the deciding.

904
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:15,417
That's right.

905
01:03:15,668 --> 01:03:18,504
This is John MacDowd,
my favorite American impresario.

906
01:03:18,754 --> 01:03:20,464
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

907
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:23,050
I've been trying to persuade Henri
to come to America...

908
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,593
...and give us Yanks a break.

909
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:26,595
He says he has to
talk it over with you.

910
01:03:26,846 --> 01:03:28,722
You make him do it, Miss Lise.

911
01:03:28,973 --> 01:03:31,684
- I'll call you in a few days.
- That's all right.

912
01:03:31,934 --> 01:03:35,981
And may I say, your Lise certainly
lives up to your advertisements.

913
01:03:36,231 --> 01:03:38,942
Thank you, Johnny.
Good night.

914
01:03:39,192 --> 01:03:42,237
- I'm sorry, but the movie...
- Never mind the movie.

915
01:03:42,487 --> 01:03:44,072
What do think of the news?

916
01:03:44,322 --> 01:03:46,950
John wants me to go
on an American tour.

917
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,411
We could get married
and go together.

918
01:03:49,661 --> 01:03:53,373
Doesn't that sound wonderful?

919
01:03:53,665 --> 01:03:55,625
- When would you go?
- Not for a few weeks.

920
01:03:55,876 --> 01:03:58,003
John will have to
see first about bookings.

921
01:03:58,253 --> 01:04:00,047
But it could be beautiful.

922
01:04:00,298 --> 01:04:01,841
A honeymoon on the boat...

923
01:04:02,091 --> 01:04:04,927
...then America.

924
01:04:05,178 --> 01:04:08,890
You'll love the Americans.

925
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:30,787
- Your limousine is here, sir.
- Thanks.

926
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:32,956
This sponsor of yours...

927
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:35,626
...what does she want
from you in return?

928
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:39,213
-Don't tell me. I shock easily.
-You're crazy. She isn't interested in me.

929
01:04:39,463 --> 01:04:42,966
She's just a goodhearted kid
who likes the way I paint.

930
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:45,385
That's real dreamy of her.

931
01:04:45,636 --> 01:04:47,513
Tell me, when you get married...

932
01:04:47,763 --> 01:04:51,392
...will you keep your maiden name?

933
01:05:00,527 --> 01:05:02,445
Hello, Therese.

934
01:05:02,695 --> 01:05:05,615
"Monsieur" Jerry, don't pay
any attention to Monsieur Cook.

935
01:05:05,865 --> 01:05:06,825
I don't intend to.

936
01:05:07,075 --> 01:05:08,910
Suppose you do have to make
love to the lady?

937
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,328
It's all for the sake of art.

938
01:05:10,578 --> 01:05:13,833
I don't have to make love...

939
01:10:04,176 --> 01:10:06,970
Bravo!

940
01:10:10,182 --> 01:10:11,642
Colossal! Encore!

941
01:10:11,893 --> 01:10:17,356
Encore! "Magnifique"! Bravo!

942
01:10:41,632 --> 01:10:42,925
Who are we seeing here?

943
01:10:43,175 --> 01:10:46,887
Never you mind.
Wait and see.

944
01:11:08,535 --> 01:11:10,161
What is all this?

945
01:11:10,411 --> 01:11:12,705
Your studio.
Isn't it beautiful?

946
01:11:12,956 --> 01:11:14,332
I've got a studio.

947
01:11:14,582 --> 01:11:17,752
Well, yes, I know, Jerry,
but you need space.

948
01:11:18,002 --> 01:11:20,296
This isn't to live in,
it's to work in.

949
01:11:20,547 --> 01:11:23,174
I can't afford a joint like this.

950
01:11:23,424 --> 01:11:25,469
Why do you make
such an issue of money?

951
01:11:25,719 --> 01:11:27,137
Because I ain't got any...

952
01:11:27,388 --> 01:11:30,975
...and when you ain't got any,
it takes on a curious significance.

953
01:11:31,225 --> 01:11:33,686
Don't be silly.
You'll be able to pay me back.

954
01:11:33,936 --> 01:11:35,396
In three months.

955
01:11:35,646 --> 01:11:37,356
Three months?
What do you mean?

956
01:11:37,606 --> 01:11:38,649
That's the real surprise.

957
01:11:38,899 --> 01:11:41,569
Your exhibition at
the Parmentier Galleries.

958
01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:43,404
My exhibition in three months?

959
01:11:43,654 --> 01:11:45,573
Already they're
arranging posters...

960
01:11:45,823 --> 01:11:47,408
Wait a minute, hold everything.

961
01:11:47,658 --> 01:11:50,871
Sit down and let's see
if I can explain this to you.

962
01:11:51,121 --> 01:11:54,040
More than anything,
I want to have an exhibition.

963
01:11:54,291 --> 01:11:55,834
But when I'm ready.

964
01:11:56,084 --> 01:11:58,920
When my stuff is good enough
to show to the public and critics.

965
01:11:59,171 --> 01:12:02,007
You can't set a production date
for a thing like that.

966
01:12:02,257 --> 01:12:05,051
Don't you understand?
I'm not manufacturing paper cups.

967
01:12:05,302 --> 01:12:07,220
I do understand, Jerry.

968
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:10,891
But you're a painter and you want
people to see what you've painted.

969
01:12:11,141 --> 01:12:13,185
I want that too.

970
01:12:13,435 --> 01:12:17,732
Give me an opportunity to provide
a decent show at a decent gallery...

971
01:12:17,982 --> 01:12:20,485
...where people can see your things.

972
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,904
Is that so extraordinary?

973
01:12:23,154 --> 01:12:26,032
Look, you're a painter
and a good one.

974
01:12:26,282 --> 01:12:28,576
I happen to have a little drive.

975
01:12:28,826 --> 01:12:31,078
That's a good combination.

976
01:12:31,329 --> 01:12:34,749
Besides, you have to
face the critics sometime.

977
01:12:34,999 --> 01:12:39,086
Yeah, but three months.

978
01:12:39,838 --> 01:12:42,216
Of course, it'll be work.
Hard work.

979
01:12:42,466 --> 01:12:45,719
That doesn't matter.

980
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:53,644
I'll do it.
On one condition.

981
01:12:53,894 --> 01:12:56,396
I pay you back.

982
01:12:56,647 --> 01:12:58,690
Jerry, I'm so glad.

983
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:02,986
I would have died if you'd said no.

984
01:14:40,129 --> 01:14:42,548
- Did you think I wasn't coming?
- No, I thought you would.

985
01:14:42,798 --> 01:14:46,595
Let's take a cab over to the Bois.

986
01:14:58,065 --> 01:14:59,858
I want to drop my stuff off.

987
01:15:00,108 --> 01:15:03,362
- When do you have to be back?
- In an hour or so.

988
01:15:03,612 --> 01:15:05,197
That's not much time.

989
01:15:05,447 --> 01:15:07,950
What kept you?
Why were you so late?

990
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,119
Well, I...

991
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:13,915
I wanted to tell you, Jerry...

992
01:15:14,165 --> 01:15:16,918
What?

993
01:15:17,627 --> 01:15:21,422
We have so little time together.
Can't we have our own world...

994
01:15:21,673 --> 01:15:26,302
...and not talk about anything
that happens when we're apart?

995
01:15:26,553 --> 01:15:30,723
I promise I'll never ask
what you do when you're not with me.

996
01:15:30,974 --> 01:15:33,101
Well, I suppose it's just as well.

997
01:15:33,352 --> 01:15:35,855
- What?
- Nothing.

998
01:15:36,105 --> 01:15:39,441
Why? What do you do
when you're not with me?

999
01:15:39,692 --> 01:15:42,069
If you don't want to
talk about it, okay.

1000
01:15:42,319 --> 01:15:45,781
Let's let it go at that.

1001
01:15:49,535 --> 01:15:52,955
Kiss me.

1002
01:15:57,585 --> 01:15:59,921
- Why are we stopping here?
- I live here.

1003
01:16:00,172 --> 01:16:04,676
- No, Jerry, let's go on...
- I want to leave my things.

1004
01:16:04,718 --> 01:16:06,219
I'll be back in a minute.

1005
01:16:06,469 --> 01:16:07,470
Hi, kid.

1006
01:16:07,721 --> 01:16:09,264
- What's your rush?
- Busy, busy.

1007
01:16:09,514 --> 01:16:13,393
Have Therese put these in my room.

1008
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:16,271
Sit down.
Have some coffee.

1009
01:16:16,521 --> 01:16:21,067
I've got someone waiting
in a cab. See you later.

1010
01:16:25,281 --> 01:16:28,784
Have some coffee.
You have time now.

1011
01:16:29,035 --> 01:16:30,578
Georges, two coffees.

1012
01:16:30,828 --> 01:16:34,540
- "Bonjour", Jerry, Adam.
- Hi, kid.

1013
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:43,216
So your exhibition's
set for next month?

1014
01:16:43,466 --> 01:16:44,509
Why so glum?

1015
01:16:44,759 --> 01:16:46,761
- Woman trouble.
- Proves you're a man.

1016
01:16:47,011 --> 01:16:50,140
That was her in the cab.

1017
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:02,861
I told you this sponsoring business
was complicated.

1018
01:17:03,111 --> 01:17:06,031
Women act like men
and want to be treated like women.

1019
01:17:06,281 --> 01:17:07,407
What are you talking about?

1020
01:17:07,658 --> 01:17:09,827
That girl in the cab.
The suntan queen.

1021
01:17:10,077 --> 01:17:12,246
No. That's a different girl.

1022
01:17:12,497 --> 01:17:15,792
You're a busy little man these days.

1023
01:17:16,042 --> 01:17:17,669
I'm hooked.

1024
01:17:17,919 --> 01:17:19,587
That girl's it.

1025
01:17:19,838 --> 01:17:22,131
Is she worthy of
a struggling young artist?

1026
01:17:22,382 --> 01:17:25,593
She's worthy of anyone.
She's wonderful.

1027
01:17:25,844 --> 01:17:28,847
What gets me is,
I don't know anything about her.

1028
01:17:29,097 --> 01:17:33,226
We manage to be together for a few
moments and then off she goes.

1029
01:17:33,476 --> 01:17:35,937
Sometimes we have
a wonderful time together.

1030
01:17:36,187 --> 01:17:39,024
Other times it's no fun at all...

1031
01:17:39,275 --> 01:17:41,569
...but I got to be with her.

1032
01:17:41,819 --> 01:17:44,905
Yep. You're hooked.

1033
01:17:45,239 --> 01:17:49,410
- What's her name?
- Lise Bouvier.

1034
01:17:50,077 --> 01:17:52,371
Georges, some brandy.

1035
01:17:52,621 --> 01:17:55,958
And some cleaning fluid.

1036
01:17:59,044 --> 01:18:01,964
- Hi, Hank.
- Jerry. Adam. May I sit down?

1037
01:18:02,215 --> 01:18:03,425
- My guest.
- Thank you.

1038
01:18:03,675 --> 01:18:05,010
Georges, a little sherry.

1039
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:08,054
Adam, I have wonderful news.
Wonderful news.

1040
01:18:08,305 --> 01:18:10,473
That's great.
Tell us something cheery.

1041
01:18:10,724 --> 01:18:13,643
- I'm going to be married.
- You're what?

1042
01:18:13,894 --> 01:18:17,647
We're getting married and going
to America on our honeymoon.

1043
01:18:17,898 --> 01:18:20,275
Another brandy.
When was this decided?

1044
01:18:20,525 --> 01:18:21,943
- Last night.
- Congratulations, Hank.

1045
01:18:22,194 --> 01:18:23,695
I'm glad somebody's happy.

1046
01:18:23,945 --> 01:18:25,822
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

1047
01:18:26,072 --> 01:18:27,116
Maybe I can help.

1048
01:18:27,366 --> 01:18:30,494
Did I ever tell you about
the time I performed for Hitler?

1049
01:18:30,745 --> 01:18:33,664
Wait. Jerry has some problem,
and I'd like to hear about it.

1050
01:18:33,915 --> 01:18:36,501
It's pretty complicated.
I'll make it brief.

1051
01:18:36,751 --> 01:18:38,544
There's a gal who's sponsoring me...

1052
01:18:38,794 --> 01:18:40,379
...and she's really
helping me a lot, but...

1053
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:42,507
She's stuck on me.

1054
01:18:42,757 --> 01:18:44,133
There's a girl I'm stuck on.

1055
01:18:44,383 --> 01:18:45,635
She doesn't know about the first one.

1056
01:18:45,885 --> 01:18:48,054
Naturally.
So far this is very ordinary.

1057
01:18:48,304 --> 01:18:49,680
- So far.
- Now wait.

1058
01:18:49,931 --> 01:18:52,434
The girl I'm stuck on has
something she can't tell me.

1059
01:18:52,684 --> 01:18:56,063
So we go out together
and go out together and get nowhere.

1060
01:18:56,313 --> 01:18:57,689
Let me ask you something.

1061
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:01,360
Is this girl, as you say,
stuck on you?

1062
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:04,488
- I think so.
- Then you have no problems.

1063
01:19:04,738 --> 01:19:05,739
Where'd they go?

1064
01:19:05,989 --> 01:19:08,075
- No problems?
- Of course not.

1065
01:19:08,325 --> 01:19:10,869
There's only one problem with
a man and a woman.

1066
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:13,831
When one of them's in love
and the other isn't.

1067
01:19:14,081 --> 01:19:15,874
After that, it's all mechanics.

1068
01:19:16,124 --> 01:19:18,837
Have you told her you love her?

1069
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:20,588
No, not in so many words.

1070
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:23,633
When you don't know what goes,
you're afraid to get hurt.

1071
01:19:23,883 --> 01:19:25,885
The first thing to do
is to tell her.

1072
01:19:26,135 --> 01:19:28,388
Believe me, Jerry, with a woman...

1073
01:19:28,638 --> 01:19:31,099
...one insincere "I love you"
that's said...

1074
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:34,978
...will bring more results than ten
sincere ones that aren't.

1075
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:37,355
So go to her and tell her
you love her.

1076
01:19:37,605 --> 01:19:39,315
Then she'll tell you she loves you.

1077
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:41,235
Then you will embrace.

1078
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:43,237
You will both be very happy.

1079
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:46,365
And then you will ask
her to marry you.

1080
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,909
- You want to, don't you?
- Sure. Sure.

1081
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:51,412
Good. Then she will say yes...

1082
01:19:51,662 --> 01:19:54,915
...and then you will tell her
about these other little matters...

1083
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:56,709
...and she will tell you about hers.

1084
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:59,753
And you'll see.
They won't seem important anymore.

1085
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:01,422
Is it as simple as that?

1086
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:03,841
Strange as it seems, yes.
So be happy.

1087
01:20:04,091 --> 01:20:06,845
- You only find the right woman once.
- That many times?

1088
01:20:07,095 --> 01:20:09,347
- When will you be with her?
- In a little while.

1089
01:20:09,598 --> 01:20:11,099
So you know what to do?

1090
01:20:11,349 --> 01:20:13,685
- I'll do it. Thanks.
- Good.

1091
01:20:13,935 --> 01:20:16,271
Adam, to be in love is to be alive.

1092
01:20:16,521 --> 01:20:18,398
Jerry and I, we are so lucky,
eh, Jerry?

1093
01:20:18,908 --> 01:20:20,660
Henri's right.
There's nothing like it.

1094
01:20:20,711 --> 01:20:22,061
C'est formidable!

1095
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:23,661
C'est magnifique!

1096
01:20:24,462 --> 01:20:26,562
'S wonderful!

1097
01:20:27,404 --> 01:20:30,163
'S marvelous!

1098
01:20:30,504 --> 01:20:35,264
She should care for me!

1099
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:39,665
'S awful nice!

1100
01:20:40,446 --> 01:20:43,466
'S Paradise!

1101
01:20:43,707 --> 01:20:49,267
'S what I love to see!

1102
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:56,168
She's made my life so glamorous

1103
01:20:57,049 --> 01:21:02,469
You can't blame me for feeling amorous

1104
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:05,570
Oh, 's wonderful!

1105
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:09,171
'S marvelous!

1106
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:14,172
That she should care for me!

1107
01:21:16,173 --> 01:21:19,073
- 'S wonderful!
- 'S wonderful!

1108
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:22,274
- 'S marvelous!
- 'S marvelous!

1109
01:21:22,424 --> 01:21:26,774
She should care for me!

1110
01:21:29,275 --> 01:21:32,275
- 'S awful nice!
- 'S awful nice!

1111
01:21:32,476 --> 01:21:35,776
- 'S Paradise!
- 'S Paradise

1112
01:21:35,927 --> 01:21:40,077
'S what I love to see!

1113
01:21:42,778 --> 01:21:48,208
She's made my life so glamorous

1114
01:21:48,899 --> 01:21:54,509
You can't blame me for feeling amorous

1115
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:57,410
Oh, 's wonderful!

1116
01:21:58,701 --> 01:22:01,911
'S marvelous

1117
01:22:02,577 --> 01:22:07,012
That she should care for me!

1118
01:22:40,013 --> 01:22:42,313
- 'S wonderful!
- 'S wonderful!

1119
01:22:42,514 --> 01:22:45,314
- C'est exceptionnel!
- 'S why I fell

1120
01:22:45,515 --> 01:22:47,915
- C'est magnifique!
- 'S what I seek

1121
01:22:48,056 --> 01:22:50,516
- C'est élégant!
- 'S what I want!

1122
01:22:50,787 --> 01:22:53,317
- C'est quelque chose!
- From head to toes!

1123
01:22:53,518 --> 01:22:56,018
'S wonderful!

1124
01:22:56,249 --> 01:23:00,019
'S marvelous!

1125
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:10,020
That she should care for me!

1126
01:23:34,644 --> 01:23:37,730
I have something to tell you.

1127
01:23:37,981 --> 01:23:40,400
I have something to tell you.

1128
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:41,651
I love you.

1129
01:23:41,901 --> 01:23:47,115
I love you and everything's
going to be all right! I know it is.

1130
01:23:48,825 --> 01:23:50,536
I won't see you anymore.

1131
01:23:50,786 --> 01:23:53,581
What do you mean?

1132
01:23:54,039 --> 01:23:55,666
I'm getting married.

1133
01:23:55,916 --> 01:23:58,836
You're getting...

1134
01:23:59,837 --> 01:24:02,798
You're in love with me,
aren't you?

1135
01:24:03,048 --> 01:24:05,342
It doesn't matter
whether I am or not.

1136
01:24:05,593 --> 01:24:08,345
It doesn't matter?

1137
01:24:08,596 --> 01:24:10,556
I couldn't leave him.

1138
01:24:10,806 --> 01:24:15,854
- Who?
- His name is Henri Baurel.

1139
01:24:19,107 --> 01:24:22,611
I practically owe him
my life, Jerry.

1140
01:24:22,861 --> 01:24:25,989
During the war, my parents
worked for the Resistance.

1141
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:29,034
I was so young,
they asked Henri to hide me...

1142
01:24:29,284 --> 01:24:32,704
...and if he'd been caught,
it would have been the end of him.

1143
01:24:32,954 --> 01:24:35,457
But for five years
he took care of me.

1144
01:24:35,707 --> 01:24:37,250
He was all I had...

1145
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,086
...and I loved him.

1146
01:24:39,337 --> 01:24:43,007
And he grew to love me.
And now I...

1147
01:24:43,257 --> 01:24:45,009
Jerry, I can't!

1148
01:24:45,259 --> 01:24:48,638
You must understand.

1149
01:24:49,096 --> 01:24:51,724
Sure.

1150
01:24:51,974 --> 01:24:53,851
Well, it's okay.

1151
01:24:54,101 --> 01:24:56,896
There's a woman who's
helping me a lot...

1152
01:24:57,146 --> 01:25:00,566
...who means so much to me, I wouldn't
want to lose her for anything.

1153
01:25:00,816 --> 01:25:04,655
My work's so important.

1154
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:09,743
Good luck.

1155
01:25:17,251 --> 01:25:21,672
If it means anything to you,
I love you!

1156
01:25:24,675 --> 01:25:27,678
Goodbye, Lise.

1157
01:25:36,646 --> 01:25:37,689
What are you doing tonight?

1158
01:25:37,939 --> 01:25:39,983
I was getting ready
for a dinner date.

1159
01:25:40,233 --> 01:25:44,737
- How about breaking it?
- That'd be difficult.

1160
01:25:45,697 --> 01:25:47,740
But not impossible.

1161
01:25:47,991 --> 01:25:51,619
You know, some days you
look exceptionally pretty.

1162
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:53,289
Is this one of them?

1163
01:25:53,539 --> 01:25:57,042
This is one of your best.

1164
01:25:58,377 --> 01:26:01,755
This is one of your good days too.

1165
01:26:02,006 --> 01:26:03,507
You and I are going out tonight.

1166
01:26:03,757 --> 01:26:06,343
I'm taking you to the Art
Students Ball. Have you been?

1167
01:26:06,594 --> 01:26:09,555
It's jet-propelled New Year's Eve,
and all of Paris will be there.

1168
01:26:09,805 --> 01:26:10,931
It's costume, isn't it?

1169
01:26:11,182 --> 01:26:14,476
I'll take care of that.
Leave it to me. Tonight's my night.

1170
01:26:14,727 --> 01:26:16,478
I feel like a woman for a change.

1171
01:26:16,729 --> 01:26:18,315
You are.

1172
01:26:18,565 --> 01:26:21,234
- Haven't I ever mentioned it to you?
- No.

1173
01:26:21,484 --> 01:26:25,610
You will hear
a lot about it from now on.

1174
01:26:25,614 --> 01:26:29,784
I'll be back soon.
I got to take care of everything.

1175
01:26:46,677 --> 01:26:48,137
I want some champagne!

1176
01:26:48,387 --> 01:26:50,640
So do I! They all seem
a bottle ahead of us!

1177
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:53,643
Come on!

1178
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:33,476
Come on, let's get some champagne!

1179
01:27:41,109 --> 01:27:43,945
- Are these parties always this wild?
- This is my first.

1180
01:27:44,195 --> 01:27:45,655
Look at that costume.

1181
01:27:45,905 --> 01:27:48,741
Jerry Mulligan, a buddy of mine,
made me come.

1182
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:50,827
- Thanks.
- To Jerry.

1183
01:27:51,077 --> 01:27:52,704
May his name survive his folly.

1184
01:27:52,954 --> 01:27:54,873
His folly? What's he doing?

1185
01:27:55,123 --> 01:27:58,586
- He's giving a show. He's a painter.
- So what's wrong with that?

1186
01:27:58,836 --> 01:28:01,964
- He'll get it in the neck.
- Then why does he do it?

1187
01:28:02,214 --> 01:28:04,884
He's got a sponsor that's
got more nerve than cash.

1188
01:28:05,134 --> 01:28:07,636
Well, Charmaine, this is farewell!

1189
01:28:07,887 --> 01:28:10,764
Let's not say "au revoir".
Just goodbye forever.

1190
01:28:11,015 --> 01:28:15,853
By the way, I think you might
like to know, I'm Jerry's sponsor.

1191
01:28:16,103 --> 01:28:18,731
I know you are.

1192
01:28:39,544 --> 01:28:40,962
The vanishing American!

1193
01:28:41,213 --> 01:28:43,924
Finally! I met
a friend of yours just now.

1194
01:28:44,174 --> 01:28:45,592
Who?

1195
01:28:45,842 --> 01:28:47,470
Him. Who is he?

1196
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:50,014
That's Adam Cook.
He's a concert pianist.

1197
01:28:50,264 --> 01:28:51,933
That's funny.
I've never heard of him.

1198
01:28:52,183 --> 01:28:56,395
It's not funny.
He's never given a concert.

1199
01:29:00,024 --> 01:29:02,109
- What a pleasant surprise.
- For me too.

1200
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,820
- Jerry, this is Lise.
- How do you do?

1201
01:29:05,071 --> 01:29:06,447
And Miss Roberts.

1202
01:29:06,697 --> 01:29:09,242
Milo, this is Henri Baurel
and fiancée.

1203
01:29:09,492 --> 01:29:11,912
This is our last night in Paris.

1204
01:29:12,162 --> 01:29:14,790
We are driving to Le Havre
at dawn to get married.

1205
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,417
And then we leave for America.

1206
01:29:17,668 --> 01:29:22,130
Well, that sounds
very romantic.

1207
01:29:22,339 --> 01:29:23,715
Let's dance, Henri.

1208
01:29:23,966 --> 01:29:25,008
Nice to have met you.

1209
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:27,094
I'll see you later.

1210
01:29:27,344 --> 01:29:29,805
That little advice I gave you
this afternoon.

1211
01:29:30,055 --> 01:29:33,016
- It worked out fine?
- It worked out great.

1212
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:35,894
Good!

1213
01:29:38,022 --> 01:29:40,233
- Haven't I seen that girl before?
- I don't know.

1214
01:29:40,483 --> 01:29:42,652
Her face seems very familiar.

1215
01:29:42,902 --> 01:29:45,071
Quite a nice boy. He's a painter.

1216
01:29:45,321 --> 01:29:48,324
A friend of Adam's.

1217
01:29:49,534 --> 01:29:54,497
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Henri.

1218
01:29:59,878 --> 01:30:01,463
Milo, I'm a fake.

1219
01:30:01,714 --> 01:30:05,509
I'm not full of life and good spirits.
It's just the reverse.

1220
01:30:05,759 --> 01:30:09,096
I shouldn't have
brought you tonight. I'm sorry.

1221
01:30:09,346 --> 01:30:11,640
That girl.

1222
01:30:11,891 --> 01:30:13,475
In the nightclub.

1223
01:30:13,726 --> 01:30:16,729
I'm in love with her.

1224
01:30:17,646 --> 01:30:21,358
I think I need some champagne.

1225
01:31:33,684 --> 01:31:37,271
I didn't know you were
getting married so quickly.

1226
01:31:37,521 --> 01:31:39,856
I couldn't tell you.

1227
01:31:40,107 --> 01:31:44,863
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

1228
01:31:45,572 --> 01:31:48,533
It's so dreadful
standing next to you like this...

1229
01:31:48,783 --> 01:31:51,536
...and not having
your arms around me.

1230
01:31:51,786 --> 01:31:56,124
You'll always be
standing next to me, Lise.

1231
01:32:12,516 --> 01:32:14,560
Maybe not always.

1232
01:32:14,810 --> 01:32:17,646
Paris has ways
of making people forget.

1233
01:32:17,897 --> 01:32:22,985
Paris? No. Not this city.

1234
01:32:23,235 --> 01:32:25,112
It's too real and too beautiful.

1235
01:32:25,362 --> 01:32:27,781
Never lets you forget anything.

1236
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,869
Reaches in and opens you wide...

1237
01:32:31,119 --> 01:32:33,163
...and you stay that way.

1238
01:32:33,413 --> 01:32:35,332
I know.

1239
01:32:35,582 --> 01:32:38,627
I came to Paris to study
and to paint it...

1240
01:32:38,877 --> 01:32:42,589
...because Utrillo did
and Lautrec did and Rouault did.

1241
01:32:42,839 --> 01:32:44,090
I loved what they created...

1242
01:32:44,341 --> 01:32:47,344
...and I thought something
would happen to me too.

1243
01:32:47,594 --> 01:32:50,055
It happened, all right.

1244
01:32:50,305 --> 01:32:52,515
Now what have I got left?

1245
01:32:52,766 --> 01:32:54,517
Paris.

1246
01:32:54,769 --> 01:32:58,397
Maybe that's enough for some,
but it isn't for me anymore.

1247
01:32:58,648 --> 01:33:00,483
Because the more beautiful
everything is...

1248
01:33:00,733 --> 01:33:04,320
...the more it'll hurt without you.

1249
01:33:07,114 --> 01:33:10,993
Don't let me leave you this way.
