2
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:27,104
Wait a minute, fellows.
You got this all wrong.

3
00:00:27,173 --> 00:00:30,263
- l never laid a hand on her.
- We got there just in time.

4
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,856
That's the trouble with you nightclub
entertainers. You're all alike.

5
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:34,853
You think you can own
every dame in the country.

6
00:00:34,923 --> 00:00:39,197
Show me a law in the country that says
l can't buy a doll a friendly drink.

7
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:44,014
No law, just don't buy a drink in your
hotel room for a doll that's underage.

8
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:47,110
- Let's get goin', bud.
- How'd l know she was jailbait?

9
00:00:47,187 --> 00:00:49,508
She looked like she was 35.

10
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,763
Want I should ask
for a driver's license?

11
00:00:51,837 --> 00:00:54,662
lf you had, you would have found out
she was the mayor's daughter.

12
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:57,320
But-- Well, can't
we talk this over?

13
00:00:57,397 --> 00:00:59,511
Come on !
You're leaving town now!

14
00:00:59,587 --> 00:01:01,907
- l can't. l'm broke.
- Here's your ticket.

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,862
One-way.

16
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:06,220
All aboard!

17
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:45,384
Thank you.

18
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:39,370
- Taxi!
- Taxicab!

19
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:42,866
Cab, lady?

20
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:45,239
Taxi, sir?

21
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,677
No, thanks. l got my car
and chauffeur meetin' me.

22
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:52,278
Step lively for a tour
of San Francisco.

23
00:03:52,352 --> 00:03:55,808
Aid, young man?
Can l give you aid?

24
00:03:55,888 --> 00:03:58,448
- What did you have in mind?
- l beg your pardon.

25
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:02,790
- Lovely homes and gardens.
- Get your early morning paper.

26
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:07,458
Golden Gate Park,
the world-renowned Cliff House...

27
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:09,727
overlooking the Pacific.

28
00:04:26,784 --> 00:04:29,878
- Let your hips swing around the whirl.
- Herm, you need a singer?

29
00:04:29,954 --> 00:04:35,153
Singer? l don't care if you sing like a
nightingale. l'm runnin' a girls' show.

30
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:40,297
Legs, not tonsils.

31
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:43,028
l see what you mean.

32
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,024
Thanks a lot.

33
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:23,632
This is the place
you can write home about.

34
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:26,141
This is the spot.

35
00:05:27,812 --> 00:05:30,975
Hurry, hurry.
The show is just about to begin.

36
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:34,017
Plenty of seats available.
Step right on in out of the rain.

37
00:05:38,722 --> 00:05:41,781
Everybody happy on the inside.

38
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:45,191
We got the greatest show in town.
The greatest show.

39
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:50,063
Come on in and hear
Ned Galvin And His Galvinizers...

40
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:52,158
the hottest band in town.

41
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:54,396
We got the finest food in town.

42
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,406
Hurry, hurry.
Everybody happy on the inside.

43
00:05:57,474 --> 00:05:59,533
Go on right in, bud.
Hey, hey!

44
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:12,487
How are your fortune cookies?

45
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:21,955
Hi, maestro.

46
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:27,061
Remember your old pal Joey?

47
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,798
How could l forget? You still owe me
30 bucks from San Diego.

48
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:32,067
What do you think l'm doing here?
l came back to pay you the loot.

49
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,770
- Oh, man, am l glad to see you.
- Sure.

50
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:36,778
Take it out of
my first week's salary.

51
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:38,837
Tell the management
l'm available.

52
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:41,746
- You're always available.
- You got to stay loose.

53
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:44,012
That's the trouble, you see,
but we have an M.C.

54
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:46,020
Excuse me a minute.

55
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:53,551
Listen, can't we go
someplace after the show?

56
00:06:53,628 --> 00:06:56,358
Have a cup of coffee and
yak up old times? Have some laughs?

57
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:59,366
That'd be good,
but l got a date with a girl.

58
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:02,165
lf she's a good-looking chick,
bring her along.

59
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:03,636
She's good-lookin' all right.

60
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:07,266
You don't understand.
Joey's turned over a new leaf.

61
00:07:07,342 --> 00:07:10,779
New Joey, huh?
Sure, how about that?

62
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:13,370
How good-lookin' is she?

63
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:16,381
Back again, huh?

64
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:30,025
I'm a red-hot mama

65
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:33,033
But I'm blue for you

66
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:36,070
l get purple with anger

67
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:39,436
At the things you do

68
00:07:39,507 --> 00:07:41,634
And l'm green with envy

69
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:45,376
When you meet a dame

70
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:47,881
And you burn my heart up

71
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,473
With an orange flame

72
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:54,487
I'm a red-hot mama

73
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:57,683
But you're white and cold

74
00:07:57,758 --> 00:07:59,726
Don't you know your mama

75
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:04,087
Has a heart of gold

76
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:09,093
Hey. Who's the mouse
with the built?

77
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:14,172
A terrific rainbow
over you and l

78
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:17,767
You got to lay off of her, Joey.
She's a nice kid.

79
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:22,679
She has ambition too.
She wants to be a singer.

80
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,240
By the way, l'm helping her
with some of her arrangements.

81
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:27,446
Looks like she's pretty
well arranged as it is.

82
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:38,693
- Has that crummy M.C. shown up yet?
- Not yet, Mike. He must be stuck.

83
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:42,702
Yeah, in a crap game. That's twice
this week this bum has been late.

84
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,397
What do you want me to do? Cut his
number out and we'll go right to finale?

85
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:48,805
- Yeah, go right into the finale.
- Okay then.

86
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:53,039
Over you and I

87
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:57,481
Come on, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's hear it. Make the ladies know it.

88
00:08:57,551 --> 00:08:59,518
You can do better than that.

89
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:04,616
Thank you. Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

90
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:08,887
We bid you good evening. l'm very happy
to be working in my hometown of...

91
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,553
San Francisco.

92
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,029
l've never seen him before.

93
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:15,898
l was born right here in this town,
right top of Telegraph Hill.

94
00:09:15,968 --> 00:09:18,527
Yes, sir, my mother
was sending a wire at the time.

95
00:09:18,603 --> 00:09:21,095
That's in Morse code. Secret Service
joke. What are you gonna do?

96
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:23,505
- You know this bum?
- Yeah, l know him.

97
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:26,773
- What's his name?
- His name's Joey Evans.

98
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:29,370
ls that the same Joey Evans
that caused all that trouble...

99
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:32,416
at the Hi-Ho Club a few years back?

100
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:34,417
You mean the same Joey Evans who--

101
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:37,149
l've had a request to do a song that's
dedicated to all the saloon keepers...

102
00:09:37,224 --> 00:09:40,191
who are blowing their liquor license
called "l Didn't Know What Time lt Was."

103
00:09:40,258 --> 00:09:42,817
l didn't know...
Oh, boy. C7, please.

104
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,332
l didn't know what time it was

105
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:51,995
Till l met you

106
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:58,231
Oh, what a lovely time it was

107
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,338
How sublime it was too

108
00:10:02,414 --> 00:10:07,680
I didn't know what day it was

109
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:10,778
You held my hand

110
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:16,351
Warm like the month of May it was

111
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:18,418
And I'll say it was grand

112
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:20,191
He's got them in a trance.

113
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,999
Better they stay awake.
ln a trance, they won't drink.

114
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,731
lf they won't drink,
I got to go out of business.

115
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:31,242
Grand to see your face
Feel your touch

116
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:34,641
Hear your voice say I'm yours

117
00:10:34,712 --> 00:10:37,146
Alone

118
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:43,118
l didn't know what time it was

119
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:44,814
And then I met you

120
00:10:46,756 --> 00:10:50,319
Oh, what a lovely time it was

121
00:10:50,394 --> 00:10:52,918
How sublime it was too

122
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:57,593
I didn't know what day it was

123
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:01,126
Then you held my hand

124
00:11:01,204 --> 00:11:05,164
Warm like the month of May it was

125
00:11:05,242 --> 00:11:08,733
And I'll say it was grand

126
00:11:08,811 --> 00:11:11,802
Grand to be alive, to be young

127
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,840
To be mad, to be yours alone

128
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:18,888
Grand to see your face
Feel your touch

129
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:22,789
Hear your voice say
I'm all your own

130
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:26,926
He's cute!

131
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:29,761
You think anyone
with pants on is cute!

132
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:32,460
That's a lie.
l Iike lots of people without pants.

133
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:36,027
- What l mean is--
- Let it lay, honey.

134
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:43,136
l'm wise and
l know what time it is now

135
00:11:44,813 --> 00:11:50,718
l'm wise and
I know what time it is now

136
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:54,150
I'm so wise

137
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:59,183
And I know what time it is now

138
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:05,132
Thank you very much.

139
00:12:08,338 --> 00:12:10,464
Okay, hit the finale.

140
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:13,998
- Say, when do I start?
- You already started.

141
00:12:14,077 --> 00:12:16,044
- What about my billing?
- Your what?

142
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,477
My billing. You know,
my picture out front.

143
00:12:18,548 --> 00:12:20,515
- Are you kidding?
- Who's kiddin', Mike?

144
00:12:20,582 --> 00:12:22,777
l got a big following. Put my picture
out front, they'll break the door down.

145
00:12:22,851 --> 00:12:24,250
You'll have the rope up
every night.

146
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:26,549
One bad night
and you'Il be on the end of it.

147
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,283
Get this straight, lover boy.
l heard a lot about you.

148
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:32,088
I don't want you sniffing
around the customers' dames.

149
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,028
One false move and
you're out on your Frances.

150
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:38,031
Yeah, you.

151
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,558
That's what l like, Mike.
Security in a job.

152
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:46,903
Say, nobody's brought it up yet,
but l get 200 a week.

153
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,840
- What?
- l'll take less.

154
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:53,244
l made it a point never to argue
with the fellow who owns the saloon.

155
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:56,943
When the sun goes down
it is wide awake

156
00:12:57,018 --> 00:13:00,146
Take your ma and your pa
and go to Frisco

157
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:03,850
Boston is England
New Orleans is France

158
00:13:03,924 --> 00:13:06,654
New York is anyone
for ten cents a dance

159
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:09,820
But this great big town
by the Golden Gate

160
00:13:09,896 --> 00:13:13,526
ls America's first
and Americans make

161
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:16,229
San Francisco

162
00:13:19,706 --> 00:13:23,041
She was one of those new kids,
a little nervous, you know.

163
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:25,874
So l coached her a little bit,
if you excuse the expression.

164
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:27,914
She was singin' all those ballads
and that draggy jazz.

165
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:29,915
One day when the fleet landed...

166
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,110
she wanted to know from me
what would please the sailors most.

167
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:34,312
So l told her.

168
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:36,913
Things were never
the same between us again.

169
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:41,222
- Linda English, Joey Evans.
- Hi.

170
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:47,661
Yeah, she was quite a doll, that little
redheaded girl of yours in San Diego.

171
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:49,703
Mine? lt was your redheaded girl.

172
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,704
lf you want to get technical
about the situation...

173
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:54,501
she was really the manager's girl,
and she was a brunette at the time.

174
00:13:54,574 --> 00:13:56,405
So good to see
American food again.

175
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:59,741
l've been out of the country. l've been
working for six months in Honolulu.

176
00:13:59,813 --> 00:14:03,043
- You don't look very tan.
- lt was the rainy season.

177
00:14:04,617 --> 00:14:08,713
lf you really want to know what
they wore under those grass skirts--

178
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:10,380
- Easy.
- Sorry.

179
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:12,982
- Excuse me, Miss, uh--
- English.

180
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:17,585
- For you, Ned.
- Okay, baby. Excuse me.

181
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:28,171
l heard about you, buster.

182
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,233
- Big reputation.
- Yeah.

183
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:34,178
But I'm too much of a lady
to say what for.

184
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:38,639
My sister worked
with you in Fresno.

185
00:14:38,718 --> 00:14:40,845
She told me all about you.

186
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,442
Which one was she?

187
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:45,821
The one you didn't
get to first base with.

188
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:48,826
Oh, she was the ugly one.
Must be twins.

189
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,760
Hey, fellows, good news.
We're coming up in the world.

190
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:59,031
Got a call from the agent, and he wants
us to play a society party on Nob Hill.

191
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:02,470
Shorty, you call the union
and get four extra guys.

192
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,201
Okay, Ned.

193
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:07,803
Something must have happened to
the band bus. lt broke down somewhere.

194
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,813
- You want to go along?
- We'd love to.

195
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:15,875
Wait a minute. Maybe this could be
a chance to pick up a couple of bucks.

196
00:15:15,953 --> 00:15:17,888
Ned boy, l'll never
forget you for this.

197
00:15:17,956 --> 00:15:21,287
Oh, yes, you wiIl forget it.
Tell the drummer to get you a jacket.

198
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:24,590
- Nice to have met you, Miss, uh--
- English.

199
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:26,492
Gotta remember that.

200
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,858
There is a small hotel

201
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:02,263
With a wishing well

202
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,062
l wish that we were there

203
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,835
Together

204
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,834
There is a bridal suite

205
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,935
One room bright and neat

206
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:18,742
Complete for us to share

207
00:16:18,816 --> 00:16:23,149
Together

208
00:16:23,221 --> 00:16:25,518
Looking through the window

209
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,582
You can see a distant steeple

210
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:32,890
Not a sign of people

211
00:16:32,963 --> 00:16:36,091
Who wants people

212
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,829
When the steeple bell

213
00:16:39,902 --> 00:16:42,565
Says, good night, sleep well

214
00:16:43,507 --> 00:16:48,239
We'll thank the small hotel
together

215
00:16:58,421 --> 00:17:01,116
l don't recognize the body,
but the face is familiar.

216
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,819
That's Mrs. Prentiss Simpson.
She owns the place.

217
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:07,029
She didn't pick up that action
at Arthur Murray's.

218
00:17:07,097 --> 00:17:11,534
You're right. She used to be
Vera Vanessa. She was in show business.

219
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,591
Then she married a wealthy guy
and retired. Don't you remember?

220
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:16,570
- lt was all in the papers.
- Yeah, now l remember.

221
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:20,405
"Vanessa, the Undresser.'' l didn't
recognize her with her clothes on.

222
00:17:20,476 --> 00:17:22,410
Not a bad-looking mouse.

223
00:17:22,478 --> 00:17:26,209
lt's too bad you can't
afford her brand of cheese.

224
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:32,821
And when the steeple bell

225
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:37,188
Says, good night, sleep well

226
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:40,195
We'll thank the small hotel

227
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:43,492
Together

228
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:59,672
Sold to the highest bidder, our
charming hostess, Mrs. Prentiss Simpson.

229
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,915
Ladies and gentlemen, l believe
this ends our little auction.

230
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:10,982
l know you'll be
very happy to learn...

231
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:13,356
that the Children's Hospital
will be richer by...

232
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:16,022
$17,605.

233
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,494
lt's a wee bit short
of our goal of 20,000...

234
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:26,871
but unfortunately we seem to
have run out of articles to auction.

235
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,966
Just a minute, Mrs. Simpson.

236
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,739
l believe l have
something to auction.

237
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:35,646
How much would you bid to hear
Mrs. Simpson do one of her numbers?

238
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:41,385
This is her favorite charity.
She couldn't possibly say no.

239
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:43,650
How much will you pay
to see the lady do the number...

240
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:47,251
that made her name
a byword from coast to coast?

241
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,422
Don't tell me you don't
remember Vera Vanessa?

242
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:54,490
She used to be Vera
with the vanishing veils.

243
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,305
You needn't start the bidding.
l will open the bidding.

244
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:04,242
l will get things going
by bidding $1,000.

245
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,575
Yes, sir, a thousand bucks
to see our lovely hostess...

246
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:13,448
do the number exactly
as she did it on the New York stage.

247
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,455
Well, not exactly because...

248
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:21,049
she promised the police commissioner
she would never do it that way again.

249
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:25,794
Do l hear 2,000? 2,000?

250
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,230
2,000!

251
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,891
- 3,000!
- That's hardly enough.

252
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:30,902
That's hardly half enough.

253
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,202
We've got to do
a lot better than that.

254
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,207
l'll bid $4,000.

255
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:46,275
Do I hear $5,000?
$5,000, ladies and gentlemen.

256
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:51,951
Doesn't any--
$5,000?

257
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,959
5,000--

258
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,168
Please-- $5,000!

259
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:08,872
- l'll bid 5,000!
- $5,000 the man bids.

260
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,568
Sold to the man for $5,000!

261
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:15,511
Ladies and gentlemen,
l give you Mrs. Prentiss Simpson.

262
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,578
You louse.

263
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,988
ln Paris
I headlined the follies

264
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:32,826
Billed as doll
of all the dollies

265
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,889
Admired by the great Stravinsky

266
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,733
But my greatest achievement
in the height of my career

267
00:20:39,804 --> 00:20:44,673
Was the time I starred for Minsky

268
00:20:46,043 --> 00:20:48,444
You're looking at
a former stripper

269
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:52,142
But before I unzip one zipper

270
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:55,744
I want it known
I was quite the artiste

271
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,312
But the intellectual kind

272
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:05,424
What was I thinking
while I worked you might ask

273
00:21:05,496 --> 00:21:12,198
While I worked these thoughts
kept crossing my mind

274
00:21:15,772 --> 00:21:20,676
Zip, Walter Lippmann
wasn't brilliant today

275
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,816
Zip, will the Giants
ever take it away

276
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:32,713
Zip, l was reading
Schopenhauer last night

277
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:38,894
Zip, and I think
that Schopenhauer was right

278
00:21:40,062 --> 00:21:43,191
Sigmund Freud has often stated
dreams and drives are all related

279
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:46,531
Zip, I'm a firm believer

280
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:49,595
Dorothy Dix's daily column
tells that love is dear and solemn

281
00:21:49,672 --> 00:21:52,540
Zip, l can take or leave her

282
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:58,478
Zip, it took intellect
to master my art

283
00:21:58,548 --> 00:22:02,449
Zip, every movement
from the heart

284
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:07,653
l have read the works of Plato
Translated most of Cato

285
00:22:07,722 --> 00:22:10,886
Zip, I am such a scholar

286
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,861
I don't care for Whistler's mother
Charley's aunt or Schubert's brother

287
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,923
Zip, had to make a dollar

288
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,868
Zip, you have asked me
what l think while l work

289
00:22:22,972 --> 00:22:26,499
Zip, I've an intellectual quirk

290
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:34,541
And my thoughts may skip
whenever so inclined

291
00:22:34,617 --> 00:22:36,847
Oh, zip

292
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,184
Zip, zip

293
00:22:40,256 --> 00:22:46,422
l'm a broad
with a broad, broad mind

294
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:53,797
More! More!

295
00:22:57,238 --> 00:22:59,207
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

296
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:03,405
Now if you'll all step onto
the terrace, supper is being served.

297
00:23:05,815 --> 00:23:08,442
l think that's a dandy idea.
Nothing like a midnight snack--

298
00:23:08,516 --> 00:23:11,212
Just a minute,
my presumptuous friend.

299
00:23:11,286 --> 00:23:13,481
The help is being fed
in the kitchen.

300
00:23:13,555 --> 00:23:15,614
T-R-U--

301
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,715
lf you ever want to make a comeback,
l got some dandy material.

302
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:19,761
You can reach me
at the Barbary Coast Club.

303
00:23:54,797 --> 00:23:57,662
- Good night, Ned.
- Good night. See you in the morning.

304
00:24:16,582 --> 00:24:19,381
Before l go, there's
one thing l'd like to know.

305
00:24:19,453 --> 00:24:20,750
What's that?

306
00:24:20,821 --> 00:24:23,790
What would you have done
if you'd been stuck for the 4,000?

307
00:24:23,857 --> 00:24:26,451
Simple. l'd have killed myself.

308
00:24:26,527 --> 00:24:30,326
- Good night, Miss, uh--
- Forget it.

309
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:35,166
- Good night, Linda.
- Good night, Ned. See you at rehearsal.

310
00:24:40,374 --> 00:24:43,434
Of all the dirty,
rotten, lowdown tricks.

311
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,774
- What are you talking about?
- You know what l'm talking about.

312
00:24:45,845 --> 00:24:48,576
Linda. You know
l'm stuck on her.

313
00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:51,549
- l never even gave her a second look.
- That's just it.

314
00:24:51,617 --> 00:24:54,881
This is a beautiful girl,
and you act like she doesn't exist.

315
00:24:54,954 --> 00:24:57,115
What are you trying to do?
Make a move with her?

316
00:24:57,191 --> 00:24:58,782
- Who, me?
- No, him!

317
00:24:58,858 --> 00:25:03,056
l told you l turned over a new leaf.
She's not my type.

318
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,529
They're all your type, Joey.

319
00:25:11,138 --> 00:25:13,434
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

320
00:25:13,505 --> 00:25:16,270
l'm going to stay with you.
l got to have a place to stay.

321
00:25:16,342 --> 00:25:19,174
Not with me. I just as soon
bunk with a cobra.

322
00:25:19,245 --> 00:25:22,305
Just a minute.
Here's 20 bucks.

323
00:25:22,381 --> 00:25:24,975
This is your share of tonight's take.
And you know what?

324
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,246
- What?
- Get your own room.

325
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,347
Ned, l'm hurt, really.

326
00:25:31,423 --> 00:25:33,516
But if that's the way
you want it, okay.

327
00:25:33,592 --> 00:25:37,028
Sure, l know. l'm going
to hate myself in the morning.

328
00:25:37,095 --> 00:25:39,724
You may not have
to wait that long.

329
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:08,151
- What do you want?
- l want to rent the room.

330
00:26:08,225 --> 00:26:10,661
At this hour?
Come back later.

331
00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:13,219
l need it now.
l'm tired.

332
00:26:30,347 --> 00:26:33,008
Sure you're not
one of those sex fiends?

333
00:26:34,251 --> 00:26:37,186
Me? No, but l'm not against it.

334
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:40,821
- Where's your baggage?
- l left it at the airport.

335
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,483
lt's coming in the morning.

336
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,360
By the way, when the boy comes,
would you tip him? Here's $10.

337
00:26:47,698 --> 00:26:49,962
All right.

338
00:26:52,635 --> 00:26:54,604
l'd like something quiet.

339
00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:57,504
You wouldn't have a room next
to someone who works nights, would you?

340
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:00,635
l've got just the thing.
Second floor front...

341
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,908
next to a young lady--
an actress-- but very refined.

342
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:07,883
You share a bath.

343
00:27:07,952 --> 00:27:09,351
We do?

344
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,285
She's nice and clean.

345
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,885
ls this what you want?

346
00:27:18,962 --> 00:27:20,896
lt's the closest thing to it.

347
00:27:20,964 --> 00:27:25,367
l don't allow pets, cooking in the room
or guests of the opposite sex...

348
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:27,835
unless related.

349
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:30,271
l have several nieces.

350
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,834
That'll be $40 a month
in advance.

351
00:27:34,912 --> 00:27:37,378
You wouldn't have change of
a hundred dollars, would you?

352
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,473
Think l want to get
murdered in my bed?

353
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:43,610
No, of course. Well,
here's 10, ma'am, on account.

354
00:27:43,686 --> 00:27:47,122
Right. l'll get you some towels.

355
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,562
Thank you.

356
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,331
l'll hurry her up.

357
00:28:02,404 --> 00:28:05,100
- Who is it?
- Mrs. Casey.

358
00:28:05,173 --> 00:28:07,699
l want you
to meet your new neighbor.

359
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,100
Oh, no!

360
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:17,513
- You know each other?
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:28:17,587 --> 00:28:21,215
- What a coincidence.
- lsn't it though?

362
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,020
If you were my girl,
you wouldn't need one of those.

363
00:28:26,627 --> 00:28:31,156
Well, l'm filling it
for Mrs. Casey.

364
00:28:34,036 --> 00:28:38,302
You shouldn't really wear pajamas.
You're definitely the nightgown type.

365
00:28:38,373 --> 00:28:39,805
The shorties.

366
00:28:51,385 --> 00:28:53,320
l'll pay you next week.

367
00:28:53,387 --> 00:28:56,481
You alter that one to fit this good,
l'll send around all my friends.

368
00:28:56,557 --> 00:28:59,753
Never mind sending your friends.
Just send your money.

369
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:14,306
Hi there, fellow. Bet you wish
you were out here, don't you?

370
00:29:16,444 --> 00:29:19,844
- Well, if it isn't Ned's girl?
- l'm not his girl.

371
00:29:19,914 --> 00:29:23,406
Oh? He told me you were.

372
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:27,250
l don't want to complain, but you
used all the hot water this morning.

373
00:29:27,321 --> 00:29:31,416
l thought that you
could use a cold shower.

374
00:29:36,663 --> 00:29:38,324
He's a cute fellow, isn't he?

375
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,061
Reminds me of a dog l had when
l was a kid. His name was Snuffy.

376
00:29:42,135 --> 00:29:45,833
l was crazy about him. One day
he got run over by a milk truck.

377
00:29:45,906 --> 00:29:48,966
l haven't been able
to drink milk since.

378
00:29:50,377 --> 00:29:51,970
Wish l could afford to buy him.

379
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:55,014
Gets a little lonely traveling
around the country all by yourself.

380
00:29:55,081 --> 00:29:57,243
Don't you have to run a song over
with your boyfriend today?

381
00:29:57,317 --> 00:30:00,616
lf you're speaking about Ned,
I told you once and for all he's--

382
00:30:00,687 --> 00:30:02,712
You're just good friends.
That's right.

383
00:30:02,788 --> 00:30:04,380
So long, Snuffy.

384
00:30:07,094 --> 00:30:10,961
By the way, both of us
use a green toothbrush.

385
00:30:11,031 --> 00:30:14,090
One of us is
going to have to change.

386
00:30:19,139 --> 00:30:23,166
Barbary Coast Club. Come right in
and see our sensational girls...

387
00:30:23,243 --> 00:30:25,768
and featuring Joey Evans.

388
00:30:26,146 --> 00:30:28,375
Come on.

389
00:30:28,447 --> 00:30:31,417
- Come on.
- Joey, stop.

390
00:30:46,731 --> 00:30:49,257
When do l get a door
on this broom closet?

391
00:30:49,334 --> 00:30:52,667
You don't. l couldn't
trust you behind a door.

392
00:30:52,738 --> 00:30:56,366
Say, lover boy, where's that big
foIlowing you're supposed to have?

393
00:30:56,442 --> 00:30:58,671
lt takes a little while, Mike.
You got to let the word percolate.

394
00:30:58,743 --> 00:31:00,974
lt better percolate pretty quick.

395
00:31:01,046 --> 00:31:04,413
- Evening, Mr. Megans. Hi, Joey.
- Hi, doll.

396
00:31:04,483 --> 00:31:08,544
Stop over tonight?
l want to show you my hi-fi.

397
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:12,787
This kid's got
a fine woofer and tweeter.

398
00:31:12,857 --> 00:31:15,325
Hey, Herm.

399
00:31:15,393 --> 00:31:17,987
Like l was saying, Mike, you got
to let the people know l'm here.

400
00:31:18,062 --> 00:31:21,690
Your name's out front, isn't it? What's
the matter? Your public can't read?

401
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:23,825
Sure, they can read, boss.
Blow up my picture.

402
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:26,131
You're blown up enough already.

403
00:31:26,204 --> 00:31:31,665
Here are your shirts, Joey.
Just the way you like them, no starch.

404
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,870
What an arrangement.

405
00:31:35,947 --> 00:31:40,475
You bum. ln two weeks you've moved in
on every doll but Gladys and Linda.

406
00:31:40,551 --> 00:31:42,348
Show time!

407
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,786
- Gladys doesn't appeal to me.
- And you don't appeal to Linda.

408
00:31:45,857 --> 00:31:51,295
Oh, no? l got plans for this doll.
Ring-a-ding plans.

409
00:31:51,361 --> 00:31:54,058
This little mouse takes
a special kind of baiting, Mike.

410
00:31:54,133 --> 00:31:56,566
You're wasting your time.
She'll never go for it.

411
00:31:58,504 --> 00:32:00,436
They all do.

412
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:08,542
lf they asked me
l could write a book

413
00:32:09,713 --> 00:32:15,844
About the way you walk
and whisper and look

414
00:32:17,655 --> 00:32:21,385
I could write a preface

415
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:24,018
On how we met

416
00:32:24,095 --> 00:32:29,158
So the world would never forget

417
00:32:31,134 --> 00:32:36,161
And the simple secret of the plot

418
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,864
ls just to tell them

419
00:32:39,943 --> 00:32:43,037
That l love you a lot

420
00:32:45,481 --> 00:32:48,940
Then the world discovers

421
00:32:49,018 --> 00:32:53,079
As my book ends

422
00:32:53,156 --> 00:32:56,853
How to make two lovers of friends

423
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:02,024
Whoever heard of singing a love song
like this without a girl?

424
00:33:02,098 --> 00:33:03,530
Come on.

425
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:11,299
About the way you walk
and whisper and look

426
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:31,716
And the simple secret of the plot

427
00:33:32,795 --> 00:33:35,923
ls just to tell them

428
00:33:35,998 --> 00:33:39,456
That l love you a lot

429
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:44,334
Then the world discovers
Sing.

430
00:33:44,406 --> 00:33:48,205
As my book ends

431
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,735
How to make

432
00:33:51,813 --> 00:33:55,374
Two lovers

433
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:58,886
Of friends

434
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,200
- Fun, huh?
- lt was wonderful.

435
00:34:18,273 --> 00:34:21,071
How's it feeI
working with a star?

436
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:24,043
Oh, don't let it go to your head.

437
00:34:28,682 --> 00:34:31,448
Just baiting the trap.

438
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,755
Why, you--

439
00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:50,933
Hey, Linda.

440
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:54,941
l'm taking a bath.
l'll be out in ten minutes.

441
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:56,943
Would you like me
to scrub your back?

442
00:34:58,244 --> 00:35:02,477
No, and you needn't bother
peeking through the keyhole.

443
00:35:05,585 --> 00:35:09,021
There's a Band-Aid over it.

444
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,225
How about a nice Sunday dinner?

445
00:35:16,295 --> 00:35:19,094
l'll take you out to the Cliff House,
and we'll have shrimp cocktail...

446
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:21,530
and a steak and French fries
and a little wine.

447
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,761
You know, the whole mishmash.

448
00:35:23,836 --> 00:35:26,464
Thanks. l can't afford it.

449
00:35:26,539 --> 00:35:28,838
What do you mean you can't afford it?
l'm poppin'.

450
00:35:31,811 --> 00:35:35,611
Why, that's very generous
of you, Joey.

451
00:35:39,286 --> 00:35:41,447
l'd love to.

452
00:35:49,262 --> 00:35:51,627
lt's funny how we both
use the same toothpaste.

453
00:35:51,697 --> 00:35:53,631
Yes, mine.

454
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:56,861
lt's little things like that
that bring people together.

455
00:35:56,936 --> 00:35:59,200
Look, there's your friend.

456
00:35:59,272 --> 00:36:01,204
Why, he's glad to see you.

457
00:36:01,273 --> 00:36:03,332
Look how he likes you.
lt's just amazing.

458
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:05,842
l come by and talk to him
every day through the window.

459
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:07,937
l pretend like he's mine.

460
00:36:09,182 --> 00:36:11,114
You really would like
to own him, wouldn't you?

461
00:36:11,183 --> 00:36:12,877
l'd give my right arm.

462
00:36:12,952 --> 00:36:15,921
- How much is this little terrier?
- Twenty-five dollars.

463
00:36:15,987 --> 00:36:17,922
- Twenty-five bucks?
- We'lI take him.

464
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:21,653
- Wait a minute. What are you doing?
- No excuses. l made up my mind.

465
00:36:21,727 --> 00:36:24,524
l couldn't let you throw away
all that money on a date with me.

466
00:36:24,596 --> 00:36:28,555
l want you to buy what you really want.
A dog to replace Snuffy.

467
00:36:28,634 --> 00:36:31,796
l don't want the--
What l mean is...

468
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,270
Mrs. Casey wouId never
let me have a dog.

469
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:36,933
Oh, but she will.
l told her how much it meant to you.

470
00:36:37,008 --> 00:36:38,703
She was touched.

471
00:36:38,778 --> 00:36:40,745
She won't be so touched
when he ruins the rug.

472
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:43,509
Nonsense. He'll be housebroke
in no time.

473
00:36:43,582 --> 00:36:46,414
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

474
00:36:46,484 --> 00:36:52,047
Here. A dog to replace Snuffy. He's
all yours. You'll never be lonely again.

475
00:36:52,123 --> 00:36:54,751
That'll be $25, mister.

476
00:36:54,826 --> 00:36:58,557
Would you like to take
some worm medicine?

477
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,359
Not if l can help it.

478
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:03,923
What about dinner? They'll never let us
in the restaurant like this.

479
00:37:04,001 --> 00:37:08,200
Now don't worry about me.
You just run along home with Snuffy.

480
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:10,934
Look at that.
He's crazy over him.

481
00:37:11,008 --> 00:37:13,068
Yeah, he loves me.

482
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:15,475
Well, don't Iet it
go to your head.

483
00:37:15,546 --> 00:37:17,913
Bye, Joey. Bye, Snuffy.

484
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:25,744
Twenty-five bucks
for a mutt like you.

485
00:37:25,823 --> 00:37:28,848
You're not exactly what l expected
to wind up with tonight.

486
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:33,592
Terrier.

487
00:37:33,664 --> 00:37:35,723
Terrier, my ankle.

488
00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:38,767
Bet you don't even know
who your old man is.

489
00:37:38,835 --> 00:37:42,567
Don't worry about it.
l don't know who mine is either.

490
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,765
That makes us members
of the same club.

491
00:37:44,841 --> 00:37:49,677
Let's see what you know.
Sit up. Roll over.

492
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:52,274
What a no-talent pooch.

493
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:54,578
Okay, get some sleep.
Tomorrow we start working.

494
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:56,584
Teach you some tricks.

495
00:38:01,258 --> 00:38:04,454
No, my little fellow.
Off. O-R-F.

496
00:38:04,528 --> 00:38:05,961
Off!

497
00:38:06,028 --> 00:38:08,292
Here. Come on.

498
00:38:19,976 --> 00:38:23,377
And remember.
The powder room is in the park.

499
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:44,492
Okay, fatten up.

500
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:46,830
Snuffy! Don't take it!

501
00:38:46,902 --> 00:38:50,533
- You mustn't do that.
- Why not? The pooch is hungry.

502
00:38:50,606 --> 00:38:54,302
- What? Chicken bones?
- What's wrong with that?

503
00:38:55,378 --> 00:38:57,436
You mean you used
to feed them to Snuffy?

504
00:39:00,984 --> 00:39:03,416
There never really
was a Snuffy, now was there?

505
00:39:06,688 --> 00:39:08,952
There is now.

506
00:39:12,092 --> 00:39:14,493
l guess l played
a dirty trick on you, huh?

507
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:18,329
Doesn't matter.
He's beginning to grow on me now.

508
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,632
So are you too.

509
00:39:30,612 --> 00:39:32,273
What's with the milk bit?

510
00:39:33,314 --> 00:39:37,115
l says, "Doc, how long do l have to
sneak in the back and drink this stuff?

511
00:39:37,185 --> 00:39:39,676
lt doesn't look good
to the customers."'

512
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:42,848
Hey, Mike, Mrs. Simpson,
the big society dame, just come in.

513
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:46,057
Mrs. Simpson? ln my place?

514
00:39:46,126 --> 00:39:47,822
Table nine.

515
00:39:49,598 --> 00:39:52,761
Take him for a walk.

516
00:39:57,871 --> 00:40:00,271
That's her. l told you l'd bring her in.
Wait a minute.

517
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:03,538
Do me a favor, will you? Let me
handle this. l'm very big with her kind.

518
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:05,579
- You're pretty big above your ears.
- l'm serious.

519
00:40:05,646 --> 00:40:08,809
Some guys got a system with horses,
and l got a system with dames.

520
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:12,816
- Hit me.
- lt's a snap.

521
00:40:12,886 --> 00:40:16,481
You treat a dame like a lady,
and treat a lady like a dame.

522
00:40:17,758 --> 00:40:21,751
And underneath those furs,
that is pure dame.

523
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:25,821
This place was definitely
not recommended by Duncan Hines.

524
00:40:25,898 --> 00:40:29,834
Wouldn't we have more fun bobbing
for apples? Why bring us here?

525
00:40:29,902 --> 00:40:32,928
l've got a little score to settle
with one of the inmates.

526
00:40:33,007 --> 00:40:34,598
Watch Joey lay on the class.

527
00:40:34,674 --> 00:40:37,576
ln the meantime, you stock up
on the caviar and the champagne...

528
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:42,344
because this dump is going to cater
to nothing but the carriage trade.

529
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:45,180
Good evening, Mrs. Simpson.
We're honored to have you here.

530
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:48,153
l'm so pleased to see you came
all the way down from the Nob Hill.

531
00:40:48,222 --> 00:40:51,747
Well, the boy auctioneer.
Won't you join us?

532
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:56,124
l'd be delighted.
l'm Joey Evans.

533
00:40:56,195 --> 00:40:58,992
- My name's Stanley.
- Mine's Livingston.

534
00:40:59,064 --> 00:41:01,056
Stanley and Livingston.
That's funny.

535
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:04,569
They have a sense of humor. l like that.
Reminds me of old Dad's.

536
00:41:04,637 --> 00:41:06,696
- Dad's?
- Yes, my father.

537
00:41:06,773 --> 00:41:10,436
He used to tease me about one thing or
another, particularly about my flying.

538
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,478
Your flying?

539
00:41:12,546 --> 00:41:14,638
ln my sports plane.

540
00:41:14,714 --> 00:41:17,308
Oh, l love my life.

541
00:41:17,382 --> 00:41:20,545
There's something you get out of flying
that you get out of nothing else.

542
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,178
Really?

543
00:41:23,257 --> 00:41:27,249
It used to upset him, because
l started when l was quite young.

544
00:41:27,326 --> 00:41:30,124
l'm sure you started very young.

545
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:34,564
lt was while l was studying aeronautics
and conversational French at Princeton.

546
00:41:34,633 --> 00:41:38,500
That is, before l resigned
to go into the theater.

547
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,730
Pierre!

548
00:41:39,805 --> 00:41:43,172
When is he going to study
conversational English?

549
00:41:43,241 --> 00:41:46,870
Would you bring the folks a bottle
of the best champagne in the cellar?

550
00:41:46,946 --> 00:41:49,140
- Oh, yes. Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

551
00:41:49,214 --> 00:41:52,706
Care for something to eat? They have
a piece of resistance that's great.

552
00:41:52,783 --> 00:41:56,118
No, thank you.
We ate before we came.

553
00:41:56,189 --> 00:42:00,682
Yes, l can't say l blame you.
l must apologize for the crum-- decor.

554
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:03,750
The man who owns this place
is an old buddy of mine.

555
00:42:03,828 --> 00:42:05,592
We were in the same platoon.

556
00:42:05,664 --> 00:42:09,498
WelI, he wired me for help
when l was in New York.

557
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:12,060
l quit my job at the Waldorf,
and here l am.

558
00:42:12,971 --> 00:42:16,304
l've always admired men
who were loyal to their friends.

559
00:42:21,178 --> 00:42:25,775
Just between you and me l have been
thinking about opening my own place.

560
00:42:25,851 --> 00:42:28,876
Something very intimate, quiet.

561
00:42:28,954 --> 00:42:31,513
Classy. Maybe have
a quartet of violins.

562
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,551
l'd be there every night.

563
00:42:35,826 --> 00:42:38,090
- You would?
- Mm-hmm.

564
00:42:38,162 --> 00:42:40,597
That's wonderful.

565
00:42:41,832 --> 00:42:43,766
What are we going to call it?

566
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:48,700
Well, l thought
we'd call it something romantic...

567
00:42:48,773 --> 00:42:51,299
and maybe foreign even.

568
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,638
How about...

569
00:42:55,946 --> 00:42:57,379
Chez Joey?

570
00:43:00,885 --> 00:43:04,048
That's very good. That's perfect.
l like that. lt's even French.

571
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:05,918
Here we are.

572
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,390
You sure that stuff is old enough
to be out on its own?

573
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:12,189
Yes, sir, 1950,
a very good year.

574
00:43:12,262 --> 00:43:15,992
May have been a good year for the grape,
but it was a lousy year for M.C.s.

575
00:43:16,633 --> 00:43:19,466
To Chez Joey.

576
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:27,301
That's what l like.
Champagne that fights back.

577
00:43:27,377 --> 00:43:29,642
Show time.

578
00:43:29,712 --> 00:43:32,180
That's me. Excuse me.

579
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:34,307
l do a little song
in this show.

580
00:43:34,384 --> 00:43:36,979
It's a lovely love song,
especially for some of my friends.

581
00:43:41,156 --> 00:43:42,623
What is this?

582
00:43:42,691 --> 00:43:47,025
Oh, we were just slumming, beauty,
and we have a lot of spots to make.

583
00:43:47,095 --> 00:43:50,963
What's next, boys? That place where
the young lady dances with the snakes?

584
00:43:55,537 --> 00:43:59,133
So that"s your system, huh?

585
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:01,143
Guess l tried it
on the wrong mare.

586
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:06,238
Your system just run out of the money
and so have you. You're through!

587
00:44:06,315 --> 00:44:09,876
You're kiddin'! Don't you know
a phony act when you see it, Mike?

588
00:44:09,952 --> 00:44:13,388
She had to do that with those
two guys along. She'll be back.

589
00:44:13,455 --> 00:44:16,686
Get your things and get out of here
before l wreck my furniture.

590
00:44:16,758 --> 00:44:20,784
Wait, wait, wait. You'll be sorry.
Come here. l want to make you a deal.

591
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,957
lf she doesn't come back by Saturday,
l'll leave without pay.

592
00:44:24,032 --> 00:44:28,297
- You bet you wilI.
- But if she comes back, l stay.

593
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:30,303
With a raise?

594
00:44:31,339 --> 00:44:34,536
Okay, you got a deal.

595
00:44:52,126 --> 00:44:54,526
Excuse me, madam.
There's a gentleman to see you.

596
00:44:54,594 --> 00:44:56,564
He wouldn't give his name.

597
00:44:56,632 --> 00:45:01,592
When l asked his business, he seemed
to talk a vernacular l couldn't follow.

598
00:45:01,669 --> 00:45:04,229
- Sounds like Superboy.
- l beg your pardon?

599
00:45:04,305 --> 00:45:07,275
Same vernacular. l'lI see him.

600
00:45:07,341 --> 00:45:11,335
You bet you will.
Get rid of the pallbearer.

601
00:45:14,448 --> 00:45:17,315
All right, what is it?

602
00:45:17,385 --> 00:45:21,252
- l dropped in to say good-bye.
- Are you going somewhere?

603
00:45:21,322 --> 00:45:24,052
Yep, away.

604
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:26,456
lt worked, baby.
l got the old bounceroo.

605
00:45:26,526 --> 00:45:29,927
- l'm through at the end of this week.
- l didn't mean that to happen.

606
00:45:29,996 --> 00:45:35,628
Don't worry your head about it.
l'm sick of this lousy town anyway.

607
00:45:35,702 --> 00:45:38,671
What l really come up here for
is to straighten you out...

608
00:45:38,738 --> 00:45:41,832
so you wouldn't get any wrong ideas
why l made a play for you.

609
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:47,279
Wouldn't want you to get any cockeyed
impressions that you appeal to me.

610
00:45:47,347 --> 00:45:51,647
The only thing about you that
appeals to me is your M-U-N-Y, money.

611
00:45:53,452 --> 00:45:57,650
- Do l make myself clear?
- Crystal clear.

612
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,893
By the way...

613
00:46:02,963 --> 00:46:07,196
if you knew what you were throwing away,
you'd cut your throat.

614
00:46:08,768 --> 00:46:11,236
Oh, Mr. Evans?

615
00:46:15,342 --> 00:46:17,605
Have you had lunch?

616
00:46:17,676 --> 00:46:21,511
Thank you, Mrs. Simpson,
but l have a luncheon date with a dog.

617
00:46:44,703 --> 00:46:49,072
Okay, it's lunchtime. Come on.

618
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:50,837
There you go.

619
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:52,934
Come on, boy.

620
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,445
l know it's not chopped liver,
but you eat what l eat...

621
00:46:58,517 --> 00:47:00,451
for the time being, anyway.

622
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,653
Here. Try this bagel.

623
00:47:04,757 --> 00:47:08,022
Hey, the fingers are mine. Easy.

624
00:47:08,093 --> 00:47:11,061
You ought to try that with
cream cheese and lox. lt's great.

625
00:47:14,266 --> 00:47:16,756
You stick with me,
you'll learn nothing but bad habits.

626
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,142
Okay, it's time for your lessons.

627
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,472
Let's see what you've learned.

628
00:47:28,981 --> 00:47:31,972
We'll begin with the praying bit.
That always gets them.

629
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:36,510
And while you're at it, pray that
Mrs. Simpson remembers to show up.

630
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,060
Lover boy.

631
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,069
You're gonna love it on the road.

632
00:47:54,138 --> 00:47:57,630
Joey, it's Linda.
May l come in?

633
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,505
Yeah, sure, come in.
Make yourself at home.

634
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:07,339
Gladys says you're leaving.

635
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:12,046
Yeah, that's right.
l got a wire from Hollywood.

636
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:15,624
Why didn't you tell me?

637
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:18,560
Why should l?
You don't care what happens to me.

638
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:23,065
Well, of course l do.
All the girls do.

639
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:26,728
l don't care about
all the girls, baby.

640
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:28,771
l just care about you.

641
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:34,332
Do you mean that, Joey,
or is it just an act?

642
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:37,005
Of course l mean it.

643
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,015
We're sure gonna miss her,
aren't we, Snuffy?

644
00:48:40,082 --> 00:48:42,017
l'm gonna miss you too.

645
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:46,180
l'm very fond of Snuffy.

646
00:48:46,255 --> 00:48:48,486
Why don't the three of us
have supper tonight?

647
00:48:51,627 --> 00:48:53,596
Show business
is a funny business.

648
00:48:53,663 --> 00:48:58,100
We may never run into each other again.
Tonight could be our last night.

649
00:49:01,671 --> 00:49:05,436
All right, Joey.
l'll change my things.

650
00:49:07,076 --> 00:49:09,909
l'll take you out to the Cliff House,
and we'll have shrimp cocktail...

651
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,504
and steak and French fries
and a little wine.

652
00:49:12,581 --> 00:49:14,844
You know, the whole mishmash.

653
00:49:24,627 --> 00:49:26,686
Mind the store.

654
00:49:30,499 --> 00:49:34,832
l'll finish your laundry, Joey.
You can pick it up later.

655
00:49:34,904 --> 00:49:37,429
Gee, l sure am gonna miss you.

656
00:49:37,506 --> 00:49:42,068
l'm gonna miss you too, doll.
Your flatwork is a gasser.

657
00:49:47,483 --> 00:49:51,316
l hear you got
the old bounceroo, big shot.

658
00:49:51,386 --> 00:49:54,652
lf you mean that you heard l was
leaving, you got it straight.

659
00:49:54,723 --> 00:49:57,521
l'm on my way to New York,
El Morocco.

660
00:49:57,592 --> 00:49:59,184
Are you kiddin'?

661
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:02,559
The only way you could get to Morocco
is to join the Foreign Legion.

662
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:03,927
Funny! Funny!

663
00:50:03,998 --> 00:50:06,763
- Here's some scraps for your dog, Joey.
- Thank you, chef.

664
00:50:06,835 --> 00:50:09,928
- Don't mention it.
- Dog, my foot. He eats them himself.

665
00:50:10,004 --> 00:50:12,871
Why not? lt's good stuff.

666
00:50:12,942 --> 00:50:16,638
Would you care to join us, sloppy?

667
00:50:26,488 --> 00:50:29,149
Take it easy.
Don't get excited.

668
00:50:31,292 --> 00:50:33,987
- Mrs. Simpson !
- Good evening.

669
00:50:34,061 --> 00:50:38,965
- Won't you come in?
- Oh, am l too late?

670
00:50:39,033 --> 00:50:41,126
You? Never!

671
00:50:43,803 --> 00:50:45,773
l'm in the mood
for a little entertainment.

672
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,104
- Pete, get the boys out of the kitchen.
- Yes, sir, right away.

673
00:50:49,176 --> 00:50:52,509
Champagne for the band
and make mine a double brandy.

674
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:56,037
- Double brandy for Mrs. Simpson!
- Okay, Mike.

675
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,388
- l believe you have a singer.
- Yeah, Joey.

676
00:51:10,464 --> 00:51:13,399
Joey, sing a song for the lady.

677
00:51:13,466 --> 00:51:15,401
What would the lady
like to hear me sing?

678
00:51:15,469 --> 00:51:17,630
Tell him to surprise me.

679
00:51:17,704 --> 00:51:20,400
Joey, surprise the lady.

680
00:51:23,042 --> 00:51:25,637
l'lI surprise the lady.

681
00:51:27,648 --> 00:51:29,706
Double brandy.

682
00:51:37,323 --> 00:51:38,756
Twenty-six.

683
00:51:53,307 --> 00:51:56,673
She gets too hungry

684
00:51:56,742 --> 00:51:58,835
For dinner at 8:00

685
00:52:00,846 --> 00:52:03,439
She likes the theater

686
00:52:04,516 --> 00:52:07,246
Never comes late

687
00:52:08,321 --> 00:52:10,379
She'd never bother

688
00:52:11,457 --> 00:52:14,254
With people she'd hate

689
00:52:15,326 --> 00:52:19,263
That's why the lady is a tramp

690
00:52:23,035 --> 00:52:26,367
Doesn't like crap games

691
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:29,067
With barons and earls

692
00:52:30,575 --> 00:52:33,305
Won't go to Harlem

693
00:52:34,378 --> 00:52:36,870
In ermine and pearls

694
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:40,543
Won't dish the dirt

695
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:45,077
With the rest of the girls

696
00:52:45,156 --> 00:52:49,387
That's why the lady is a tramp

697
00:52:51,062 --> 00:52:54,225
She likes the free

698
00:52:54,298 --> 00:52:58,759
Free fresh wind in her hair

699
00:53:00,338 --> 00:53:03,467
Life without care

700
00:53:03,542 --> 00:53:07,237
She's broke, but it's oke

701
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:09,906
Hates California

702
00:53:11,149 --> 00:53:14,709
It's cold and it's damp

703
00:53:14,785 --> 00:53:18,551
That's why the lady is a tramp

704
00:53:22,026 --> 00:53:25,461
She gets far too hungry

705
00:53:25,529 --> 00:53:28,021
To wait for dinner at 8:00

706
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:32,595
She adores the theater

707
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:35,967
And she doesn't arrive late

708
00:53:37,742 --> 00:53:41,040
She'd never bother

709
00:53:41,111 --> 00:53:44,511
With people she'd hate

710
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:48,573
That is why the lady is a tramp

711
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,887
Won't have a dice game

712
00:53:55,959 --> 00:53:59,223
With any barons and earls

713
00:53:59,295 --> 00:54:02,731
She will never go up to Harlem

714
00:54:02,799 --> 00:54:06,667
Dressed in ermine and pearls

715
00:54:07,737 --> 00:54:09,728
Won't dish the dirt

716
00:54:10,807 --> 00:54:14,402
With all the other girls

717
00:54:14,477 --> 00:54:18,709
That is why the lady is a tramp

718
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:24,278
She loves the free

719
00:54:24,354 --> 00:54:29,553
Free fresh wind in her hair

720
00:54:29,626 --> 00:54:32,685
Life without care

721
00:54:32,762 --> 00:54:34,491
She's broke

722
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:40,292
Hates California

723
00:54:40,369 --> 00:54:44,202
'Cause it's so cold and so damp

724
00:54:44,273 --> 00:54:47,036
That's why the lady

725
00:54:48,109 --> 00:54:51,772
That's why the lady

726
00:54:51,847 --> 00:54:57,184
That's why the lady is a tramp

727
00:56:06,687 --> 00:56:08,621
Come now, beauty.

728
00:56:31,978 --> 00:56:34,879
Not only will l give him a raise,
l'll buy him a bicycle.

729
00:56:34,948 --> 00:56:36,917
Champagne for everybody!

730
00:56:51,364 --> 00:56:53,833
What do you know,
a parking lot for boats.

731
00:56:55,368 --> 00:56:58,735
- v-E-R-A.
- That's correct.

732
00:56:58,805 --> 00:57:01,069
- See how smart l am?
- Care to come aboard?

733
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,506
I'd love to, Captain.

734
00:57:10,616 --> 00:57:12,585
This is quite a hideout.

735
00:57:12,652 --> 00:57:15,712
Providing you have
something to hide.

736
00:57:15,787 --> 00:57:18,154
Oh, that can be arranged.

737
00:57:18,225 --> 00:57:21,090
Yeah, this is a clever kayak,
isn't it?

738
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:23,320
My husband gave it to me.

739
00:57:23,395 --> 00:57:25,386
He's never been aboard.

740
00:57:25,464 --> 00:57:27,899
Why doesn't he try
a little Dramamine?

741
00:57:30,702 --> 00:57:34,729
This is the dining salon.
And just beyond is the galley.

742
00:57:34,806 --> 00:57:38,172
l know, it's where you keep
your slaves. Slaves?

743
00:57:38,243 --> 00:57:39,834
Nothing. Well--

744
00:57:41,848 --> 00:57:44,474
And this is the master suite.

745
00:57:44,549 --> 00:57:47,347
By the way,
where is the master?

746
00:57:49,453 --> 00:57:51,684
My husband died two years ago.

747
00:57:51,757 --> 00:57:53,349
And no cracks.

748
00:57:53,425 --> 00:57:57,418
l was just gonna say that if you ever
get tired of being a wealthy widow...

749
00:57:57,496 --> 00:58:00,192
you might like to go back
into show business.

750
00:58:00,265 --> 00:58:01,995
No thank you.

751
00:58:02,067 --> 00:58:04,591
l like being Mrs. Prentiss Simpson.

752
00:58:04,669 --> 00:58:07,797
l'm not knocking you
being Mrs. Prentiss Simpson.

753
00:58:07,872 --> 00:58:11,604
But l just thought you and me as a team,
we'd make a dandy double.

754
00:58:13,278 --> 00:58:16,577
Aren't you afraid you might
find me a bit rusty?

755
00:58:17,649 --> 00:58:19,742
Don't be ridiculous.

756
00:58:19,818 --> 00:58:22,445
Why don't you get out
of something uncomfortable...

757
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,784
and l'll give you
a small audition.

758
00:58:26,524 --> 00:58:28,355
Oh, beauty.

759
00:58:28,426 --> 00:58:32,054
You have all the subtlety
of a battering ram.

760
00:58:36,001 --> 00:58:38,560
But you wrong me, my dear.

761
00:58:40,805 --> 00:58:44,866
What l meant was perhaps you'd like to
run through one of my old routines--

762
00:58:44,942 --> 00:58:47,775
one l used to do
before l became an M.C.

763
00:58:47,845 --> 00:58:49,608
No thank you.

764
00:58:49,681 --> 00:58:52,113
That would bring back
too many memories.

765
00:58:52,182 --> 00:58:56,515
The sticks, split weeks,
drafty dressing rooms.

766
00:58:56,586 --> 00:58:58,520
Drunks tossing pennies.

767
00:59:01,392 --> 00:59:03,587
That's the story of my life.

768
00:59:05,429 --> 00:59:08,454
But l'm going places
one of these days.

769
00:59:08,531 --> 00:59:11,659
l gonna have a club
all my very own...

770
00:59:11,735 --> 00:59:13,795
my name up in lights.

771
00:59:15,139 --> 00:59:17,902
No hokey waiters rattling plates
when l'm on.

772
00:59:17,975 --> 00:59:20,772
No tough managers
beItin' me around.

773
00:59:22,613 --> 00:59:24,444
Be my own boss.

774
00:59:25,683 --> 00:59:28,206
Nobody owns Joey but Joey.

775
00:59:29,552 --> 00:59:30,814
Chez Joey?

776
00:59:36,558 --> 00:59:39,995
Chez Joey:
a place with real class.

777
00:59:41,897 --> 00:59:44,732
l might even appear
in white tie and tails.

778
00:59:46,735 --> 00:59:49,260
Might even wear an opera hat.

779
00:59:55,044 --> 00:59:56,738
Suave stuff.

780
00:59:56,812 --> 00:59:58,747
Easygoing stuff.

781
00:59:59,882 --> 01:00:02,647
l might do all of the patter
like that.

782
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:04,619
Maybe l'll do
the whole thing in French.

783
01:00:04,687 --> 01:00:06,677
Maybe you'd better not.

784
01:00:06,755 --> 01:00:09,748
That's what l said.
Maybe l'd better not.

785
01:00:09,826 --> 01:00:12,759
You'd give a lot
for a place like that, wouldn't you?

786
01:00:14,962 --> 01:00:16,555
Anything.

787
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,635
How about it?
You and me could be partners.

788
01:00:24,072 --> 01:00:26,336
What would l get out of it?

789
01:00:28,076 --> 01:00:29,667
Name something.

790
01:00:31,947 --> 01:00:34,211
There"s nothing l don't have.

791
01:00:35,317 --> 01:00:36,909
You want a bet?

792
01:00:38,187 --> 01:00:42,248
After all, two years is a long time
between drinks.

793
01:00:45,593 --> 01:00:48,529
Oh, you can hit
better than that, partner.

794
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:11,030
Bon jour, madame.

795
01:01:14,154 --> 01:01:15,746
Yes, isn't it?

796
01:01:17,447 --> 01:01:20,047
Bon jour, bon jour, bon jour.

797
01:01:20,048 --> 01:01:22,148
Madame a-t-elle bien dormi?

798
01:01:24,049 --> 01:01:26,149
Magnifique.

799
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:31,750
Madame dÃ©sire que je fasse
quelque chose por elle?

800
01:01:33,651 --> 01:01:35,451
Non, merci.

801
01:01:35,452 --> 01:01:36,652
Bien, madame.

802
01:01:47,555 --> 01:01:49,988
He's a fool...

803
01:01:50,056 --> 01:01:52,082
and don't l know it.

804
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:55,992
But a fool can have his charms.

805
01:01:59,332 --> 01:02:01,563
l'm in love...

806
01:02:01,636 --> 01:02:03,830
and don't l show it.

807
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,906
Like a babe...

808
01:02:09,242 --> 01:02:10,971
in arms.

809
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,306
Men are not a new sensation

810
01:02:17,383 --> 01:02:21,377
l've done pretty well
I think

811
01:02:21,454 --> 01:02:25,823
But this half-pint imitation

812
01:02:25,892 --> 01:02:29,691
Put me on the blink

813
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:33,531
I'm wild again

814
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,834
Beguiled again

815
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:41,636
A simpering, whimpering

816
01:02:41,706 --> 01:02:43,971
Child again

817
01:02:45,177 --> 01:02:48,511
Bewitched, bothered

818
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:51,048
And bewildered

819
01:02:52,217 --> 01:02:54,549
Am I

820
01:02:59,091 --> 01:03:01,025
Couldn't sleep

821
01:03:02,127 --> 01:03:04,527
And wouldn't sleep

822
01:03:05,663 --> 01:03:08,791
And what would l do

823
01:03:08,866 --> 01:03:11,664
If l shouldn't sleep

824
01:03:12,805 --> 01:03:15,899
Bewitched, bothered

825
01:03:15,975 --> 01:03:18,569
And bewildered

826
01:03:19,677 --> 01:03:22,203
Am l

827
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:28,679
Lost my heart

828
01:03:29,822 --> 01:03:32,017
But what of it

829
01:03:33,591 --> 01:03:36,718
My mistake

830
01:03:36,794 --> 01:03:38,728
I agree

831
01:03:40,531 --> 01:03:42,692
He's a laugh

832
01:03:43,701 --> 01:03:45,692
But I love it

833
01:03:46,904 --> 01:03:52,171
Because the love's
on me

834
01:03:54,445 --> 01:03:56,845
A pill he is

835
01:03:57,915 --> 01:04:00,849
But still he is

836
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:03,284
All mine

837
01:04:03,353 --> 01:04:07,984
And l'll keep him until he is

838
01:04:08,058 --> 01:04:11,619
Bewitched, bothered

839
01:04:11,695 --> 01:04:15,187
And bewildered

840
01:04:15,265 --> 01:04:17,859
Like me

841
01:04:39,822 --> 01:04:43,759
l guess the laugh's on me

842
01:04:45,962 --> 01:04:47,987
I've slipped again

843
01:04:49,065 --> 01:04:51,295
I've tripped again

844
01:04:52,469 --> 01:04:57,702
The way to my heart
is unzipped again

845
01:05:29,003 --> 01:05:31,438
Linda, you up yet?

846
01:05:31,507 --> 01:05:34,101
l've been up for hours.

847
01:05:34,175 --> 01:05:36,508
Open the door.
l want to talk to you.

848
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:43,850
What do you want?

849
01:05:43,918 --> 01:05:46,513
What's the idea
with all the ice?

850
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:49,854
l get it. You're burned up
because l took a powder last night.

851
01:05:49,925 --> 01:05:53,519
What possible difference
could it make to me?

852
01:05:53,595 --> 01:05:54,721
Good morning, Snuffy.

853
01:05:54,796 --> 01:05:56,991
l've got a bone for you.

854
01:05:59,968 --> 01:06:03,426
Speaking of Snuffy, l'm thinking
of making you a present of him.

855
01:06:03,505 --> 01:06:06,065
l'm planning on
blowin' this trap.

856
01:06:07,343 --> 01:06:10,505
Gonna move to a place that fits
my personality a little better.

857
01:06:10,578 --> 01:06:13,308
- You're not gonna leave the club?
- Nope.

858
01:06:13,381 --> 01:06:17,442
l'm gonna take the club with me.
Come here. Let me show you something.

859
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:20,785
Look straight up the top
of that hill, Nob Hill.

860
01:06:20,856 --> 01:06:22,481
That's where l'll take the club.

861
01:06:22,556 --> 01:06:24,650
Little old me.

862
01:06:26,761 --> 01:06:28,591
- You?
- Me...

863
01:06:28,662 --> 01:06:32,621
and Mike and all the girls
and everybody in the joint.

864
01:06:32,699 --> 01:06:36,467
lt's gonna be the same cast,
the same booze but a new address.

865
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:39,472
How? What happened?
Did somebody die?

866
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:42,235
No. As a matter of fact,
somebody came to life.

867
01:06:42,308 --> 01:06:45,006
- l have a partner.
- Who?

868
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:50,346
Yes, ma'am, we're gonna have
a real classy joint. K-L-A-S-Y.

869
01:06:50,418 --> 01:06:53,113
- Who's we?
- Me and my partner.

870
01:06:53,187 --> 01:06:55,782
Who is your partner, Joey?

871
01:06:58,192 --> 01:06:59,249
Mrs. Simpson.

872
01:07:01,394 --> 01:07:04,057
Now wait a minute.
Don't get the wrong idea.

873
01:07:04,131 --> 01:07:06,156
This is a legitimate business--

874
01:07:06,232 --> 01:07:08,292
lawyers, six-percent interest,
everything.

875
01:07:08,368 --> 01:07:09,733
Everything?

876
01:07:09,803 --> 01:07:13,067
Now don't give me
that "everything'' jazz.

877
01:07:13,139 --> 01:07:16,041
After all, this could be my big chance,
and it could be yours too...

878
01:07:16,108 --> 01:07:18,633
because l got a great idea for you
in a number in the show.

879
01:07:19,713 --> 01:07:22,545
Tell me. Just what do l
have to do for it?

880
01:07:22,615 --> 01:07:25,551
Just remember all the lyrics.

881
01:07:27,019 --> 01:07:30,217
How about Snuffy?
You gonna take him or aren't you?

882
01:07:31,791 --> 01:07:35,386
You bet l'll take him.
Not even a dog should live with you!

883
01:07:45,071 --> 01:07:46,663
His leash.

884
01:07:49,809 --> 01:07:52,676
Bye, Snuffy.
So long, old pal.

885
01:07:52,745 --> 01:07:55,270
Lucky little dog,
gettin' to live with Linda.

886
01:07:55,346 --> 01:07:57,873
Don't let her fool you.
She's a nice girl.

887
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:00,918
She just acts like
all nice girIs act: lousy.

888
01:08:50,669 --> 01:08:52,660
Good morning, Mr. Boss.

889
01:08:52,737 --> 01:08:54,329
How are you, Herm?

890
01:08:55,473 --> 01:08:59,773
Now that you got this swell new joint,
l guess there's no place for me.

891
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:02,005
Not at all.
You got a job.

892
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,207
Gee, Joey, thanks.

893
01:09:04,282 --> 01:09:07,012
Wherever there's mice,
there's always a rat.

894
01:09:19,262 --> 01:09:21,061
l'd like them about
out to there.

895
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:24,334
Out to here.

896
01:09:39,783 --> 01:09:44,220
Well, there it is, Chez Joey,
just like l pictured it to be.

897
01:09:44,288 --> 01:09:46,382
A dream come true.

898
01:09:47,625 --> 01:09:51,389
- lt means that much to you?
- You bet it does.

899
01:09:51,461 --> 01:09:55,626
Took a lot of years of scrounging
and scratching to get a joint like this.

900
01:09:55,699 --> 01:09:58,099
That isn't how you got it.

901
01:10:00,203 --> 01:10:01,831
Oh, l'm sorry.

902
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:05,508
l shouldn't have said it.
Maybe--

903
01:10:08,812 --> 01:10:11,007
Maybe you're in love with her.

904
01:10:12,149 --> 01:10:15,481
He looks a little thin.
Don't you feed him?

905
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:18,781
A lot better than you did.
He just doesn't eat.

906
01:10:22,825 --> 01:10:25,123
Maybe he's getting lonely.

907
01:10:26,663 --> 01:10:28,687
Don't look at me.
l'm eating fine.

908
01:10:47,549 --> 01:10:49,177
Who was that?

909
01:10:49,252 --> 01:10:51,277
One of the mice in the line.

910
01:10:51,354 --> 01:10:54,686
- The pretty one?
- ls she? l didn't even notice.

911
01:10:54,756 --> 01:10:57,020
You were certainly knee-deep
in conversation.

912
01:10:57,092 --> 01:10:59,059
l was asking about my dog.

913
01:10:59,127 --> 01:11:02,563
Yours? What's she doing with it?

914
01:11:02,631 --> 01:11:06,761
l gave him to her when
I evacuated Mrs. Casey's rattrap.

915
01:11:06,835 --> 01:11:09,430
- She lived there too?
- Yep.

916
01:11:10,772 --> 01:11:13,332
Why didn't you bring him with you?

917
01:11:13,408 --> 01:11:16,003
Because he wasn't yet
yacht broken.

918
01:11:39,733 --> 01:11:43,134
My funny valentine

919
01:11:43,204 --> 01:11:46,332
Sweet comic valentine

920
01:11:47,408 --> 01:11:50,308
You make me smile

921
01:11:50,377 --> 01:11:53,346
With my heart

922
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:58,813
Your looks are laughable

923
01:11:59,988 --> 01:12:03,389
Unphotographable

924
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:06,757
Yet you're my favorite

925
01:12:06,828 --> 01:12:09,490
Work of art

926
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:15,867
ls your figure less than Greek

927
01:12:15,936 --> 01:12:19,134
Is your mouth a little weak

928
01:12:20,574 --> 01:12:24,601
When you open it to speak

929
01:12:24,678 --> 01:12:28,614
Are you smart

930
01:12:30,583 --> 01:12:35,179
But don't change a hair for me

931
01:12:35,255 --> 01:12:37,985
Not if you care for me

932
01:12:39,058 --> 01:12:42,186
Stay, little valentine

933
01:12:48,468 --> 01:12:50,629
Each day

934
01:12:50,703 --> 01:12:55,572
Is Valentine's Day

935
01:13:02,883 --> 01:13:05,043
- When did she spring from the chorus?
- Who?

936
01:13:05,118 --> 01:13:07,381
The mouse in the spotlight.

937
01:13:08,588 --> 01:13:10,521
l'm beginning to talk like you.

938
01:13:10,589 --> 01:13:14,389
You mean Linda?
Well, she's Ned's girl.

939
01:13:14,459 --> 01:13:16,860
He's kind of stuck on her.

940
01:13:16,929 --> 01:13:20,490
We talked it over
and we figured she was ready.

941
01:13:21,567 --> 01:13:23,397
Ready for what?

942
01:13:53,665 --> 01:13:55,427
very nice, Miss English.

943
01:13:55,499 --> 01:13:57,865
lt was just wonderful,
beautiful.

944
01:13:57,936 --> 01:14:00,734
Pretty good, huh, Ned?
Let's do the "Kick lt Around'' number.

945
01:14:00,806 --> 01:14:02,568
Come on, kids. Let's go.

946
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,871
Don't you think
she was pretty good, partner?

947
01:14:04,943 --> 01:14:06,308
Not quite good enough.

948
01:14:06,378 --> 01:14:09,710
She's just beginning. Give her time.
Wait till you hear this next number.

949
01:14:11,182 --> 01:14:14,118
l think she'd be better off
someplace else.

950
01:14:14,186 --> 01:14:16,517
Would you like to explain that?

951
01:14:16,588 --> 01:14:18,646
l'll make it simple for you.

952
01:14:18,723 --> 01:14:21,089
She's out.

953
01:14:21,158 --> 01:14:23,719
- You want me to fire her?
- Yes, partner.

954
01:14:25,129 --> 01:14:29,225
l figure it's the onIy way
to protect my investment.

955
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,599
l don't mean the club,
l mean you.

956
01:14:33,704 --> 01:14:36,104
l think it's a stinkin' trick.

957
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:39,167
Come now, beauty.

958
01:14:40,277 --> 01:14:43,177
Don't tell me you've developed
a better nature.

959
01:14:53,991 --> 01:14:55,924
Come on, Snuffy.

960
01:14:58,629 --> 01:15:00,187
Linda, you decent?

961
01:15:00,264 --> 01:15:02,094
Just about. Come in.

962
01:15:08,305 --> 01:15:11,137
l've been thinking that
you were so good in that number...

963
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:13,472
l decided to give you
something better to do.

964
01:15:13,544 --> 01:15:15,705
- You did?
- A real blockbuster.

965
01:15:15,779 --> 01:15:18,247
That's wonderful.
Which one?

966
01:15:18,314 --> 01:15:21,647
l thought maybe
you ought to do the strip.

967
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,986
But Gladys does that number.

968
01:15:26,056 --> 01:15:29,026
You wind up out there
with nothing on.

969
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:31,059
What do you think l am?

970
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:35,325
You're the best built mouse in the
joint, so let's take advantage of it.

971
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:40,393
l won't do it!
l'm sticking to my song.

972
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:44,736
l'm sorry, baby, but l've already
given the song to Gladys.

973
01:15:44,808 --> 01:15:48,403
- l just thought you'd be pleased.
- Wait a minute.

974
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:51,674
There's something more to this.

975
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:54,842
You knew l'd say no.
You wanted me to. Why?

976
01:15:54,918 --> 01:15:58,684
Your girlfriend told you
to get rid of me, didn't she?

977
01:15:58,755 --> 01:16:00,745
- Look--
- Don't interrupt!

978
01:16:00,823 --> 01:16:03,884
But you didn't have the guts, did you?
You wanted me to quit!

979
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:07,258
Chez Joey.
Well, that's a laugh.

980
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:09,594
Why don't you change it
to Chez Vera?

981
01:16:12,066 --> 01:16:14,696
What are you waiting for?
You've run your errand.

982
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:43,527
What happened to your head?

983
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:47,329
There's something you ought to know.
l didn't have to fire her. She quit.

984
01:16:47,401 --> 01:16:49,528
That's the same thing.

985
01:16:49,604 --> 01:16:53,006
Don't let it bother you. l'm sure she'll
have no trouble finding another job.

986
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:55,838
Sure. She can always pitch
for the New York Giants.

987
01:17:08,755 --> 01:17:10,689
l want a bourbon, straight.

988
01:17:14,195 --> 01:17:17,289
lsn't it a little early in the day
for a girl who doesn't drink at night?

989
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,633
On second thought,
make it two.

990
01:18:03,075 --> 01:18:07,069
- What's with the watch bit?
- lt's getting late. Finish your drink.

991
01:18:07,148 --> 01:18:09,842
What for? We got all night.

992
01:18:09,915 --> 01:18:11,940
Oh, no, we haven't, beauty.

993
01:18:12,018 --> 01:18:14,110
l'm giving a dinner party.

994
01:18:14,186 --> 01:18:16,381
So?

995
01:18:16,455 --> 01:18:18,981
Put another plate at the table.

996
01:18:19,059 --> 01:18:22,153
lt would make 13,
and l'm superstitious.

997
01:18:24,029 --> 01:18:27,396
Only thing l'm superstitious about
is 13 in bed.

998
01:18:27,466 --> 01:18:29,400
You'll have to leave.

999
01:18:31,838 --> 01:18:34,397
l guess you think maybe l don't know
what fork to use.

1000
01:18:34,473 --> 01:18:39,207
Well, you're right, l don't, but l
wouldn't eat with those creeps anyway.

1001
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:41,543
l'll see you at the boat later.

1002
01:18:44,618 --> 01:18:47,780
l'll go down to the corner
and grab a hamburger.

1003
01:18:48,954 --> 01:18:51,116
How should l have my hamburger...

1004
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:54,125
with or without onions?

1005
01:18:55,295 --> 01:18:57,489
Without.

1006
01:18:57,562 --> 01:18:59,154
You're a cinch.

1007
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:23,046
What happened?
How come you didn't show?

1008
01:19:23,121 --> 01:19:26,057
l had to hear "Tristan and lsolde.''

1009
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:27,785
Hear him do what?

1010
01:19:29,361 --> 01:19:30,952
lt's an opera.

1011
01:19:31,029 --> 01:19:32,826
Of course.

1012
01:19:32,897 --> 01:19:35,560
Afterward, they all came back here
and l couldn't get out of it.

1013
01:19:39,605 --> 01:19:42,573
Aren't you gonna pipe me aboard?

1014
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,098
- What was that?
- l'm listening to the late news.

1015
01:19:46,176 --> 01:19:48,509
Sleep tight, doll.
Talk to you tomorrow.

1016
01:19:52,216 --> 01:19:54,150
Man's best friend.

1017
01:19:56,386 --> 01:19:57,979
Or was that your mother?

1018
01:19:58,055 --> 01:20:01,651
I wonder what she'd say
if she could see me now.

1019
01:20:03,328 --> 01:20:05,420
She'd say that you were stoned.

1020
01:20:05,494 --> 01:20:08,590
And she'd also want to know
what you're doing in my bedroom.

1021
01:20:08,665 --> 01:20:10,657
l decided to take your offer.

1022
01:20:10,734 --> 01:20:12,167
What offer?

1023
01:20:13,438 --> 01:20:15,200
Strip.

1024
01:20:15,272 --> 01:20:16,831
Peeled.

1025
01:20:18,241 --> 01:20:19,936
Take it off and let it lay.

1026
01:20:25,349 --> 01:20:27,716
You were right.

1027
01:20:27,784 --> 01:20:29,945
l do have a good shape.

1028
01:20:32,289 --> 01:20:33,881
Confidentially...

1029
01:20:35,691 --> 01:20:37,626
l'm stacked.

1030
01:20:38,695 --> 01:20:40,787
Bet you thought l wouldn't,
didn't you?

1031
01:20:40,863 --> 01:20:42,991
l'll bet you even thought
that l couldn't.

1032
01:20:44,101 --> 01:20:45,864
But l can.

1033
01:20:49,972 --> 01:20:51,701
And l will.

1034
01:22:29,704 --> 01:22:31,866
Bewitched

1035
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:33,873
Bothered

1036
01:22:56,231 --> 01:22:58,221
lt's all right, Snuffy.

1037
01:22:58,298 --> 01:23:01,063
lf l walk in my sleep,
bite me.

1038
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:26,892
Well, good morning.

1039
01:23:28,695 --> 01:23:31,289
Oh, what's good about it?

1040
01:23:31,364 --> 01:23:33,958
Oh, your first hangover, huh?

1041
01:23:35,934 --> 01:23:38,530
Well, there's a first time
for everybody.

1042
01:23:44,143 --> 01:23:47,977
Why do people drink when
it feels so awful the morning after?

1043
01:23:48,047 --> 01:23:51,039
Maybe because it feels so good
the night before.

1044
01:23:55,755 --> 01:23:57,689
What did l do last night?

1045
01:23:59,927 --> 01:24:01,620
You kissed me.

1046
01:24:02,828 --> 01:24:04,591
l wasn't myself.

1047
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:07,292
Yeah, but whoever you were,
you were great.

1048
01:24:09,536 --> 01:24:11,092
Then what?

1049
01:24:11,169 --> 01:24:13,831
Then you passed out.

1050
01:24:13,905 --> 01:24:15,840
I'm ashamed of myself.

1051
01:24:15,908 --> 01:24:17,500
Me too.

1052
01:24:18,911 --> 01:24:21,640
Why? What did you do?

1053
01:24:22,949 --> 01:24:24,881
Nothing.

1054
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:27,680
Let's try on some breakfast.
Come on.

1055
01:24:27,752 --> 01:24:29,687
lt'll do you good.

1056
01:24:33,358 --> 01:24:34,950
Nice and easy.

1057
01:24:39,331 --> 01:24:42,629
Snuffy, please.
Not so loud.

1058
01:24:46,606 --> 01:24:48,699
- There you are.
- You cook?

1059
01:24:48,774 --> 01:24:51,640
You can't go through your life
on Wheaties alone.

1060
01:24:53,946 --> 01:24:55,537
l couldn't, Joey.

1061
01:24:55,614 --> 01:24:57,980
l got an idea.

1062
01:24:58,049 --> 01:25:02,315
lt's an old family recipe.
Hangovers run in my family.

1063
01:25:02,387 --> 01:25:04,650
My old man wrote the book.

1064
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:09,859
l think this will
straighten you out. Go on.

1065
01:25:10,928 --> 01:25:13,194
Come on, Snuff.
Come on, boy. Up.

1066
01:25:16,934 --> 01:25:18,369
A bagel.

1067
01:25:28,912 --> 01:25:30,607
Something he picked up from me.

1068
01:25:33,416 --> 01:25:34,678
Fine pupil.

1069
01:25:34,751 --> 01:25:38,881
- You really don't feel well, do you?
- It's not just the hangover.

1070
01:25:40,724 --> 01:25:42,920
You see, where l come from...

1071
01:25:42,993 --> 01:25:47,396
a girl just doesn't spend the night
on a yacht and then stay for breakfast.

1072
01:25:48,464 --> 01:25:50,933
Of course, we don't have
any yachts.

1073
01:25:51,001 --> 01:25:53,060
By the way,
where do you come from?

1074
01:25:53,136 --> 01:25:54,728
Albuquerque.

1075
01:25:56,507 --> 01:25:58,940
What's wrong with Albuquerque?

1076
01:25:59,008 --> 01:26:01,442
For one thing,
they don't have any yachts.

1077
01:26:01,511 --> 01:26:04,777
Secondly, l'm surprised your mother
let you come to the big town.

1078
01:26:04,848 --> 01:26:08,782
Well, my mother says a nice girl's
a nice girl wherever she is.

1079
01:26:08,851 --> 01:26:11,320
Yeah, l know.
And a bum is a bum.

1080
01:26:11,388 --> 01:26:13,321
She didn't say that.

1081
01:26:14,457 --> 01:26:17,324
Besides, what about last night?

1082
01:26:17,393 --> 01:26:20,259
l made a fool out of myself,
and you didn't take advantage of it.

1083
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:22,456
Don't pin any medals on me.

1084
01:26:22,531 --> 01:26:25,467
lt just so happens in my book
it takes two to tango.

1085
01:26:26,569 --> 01:26:29,299
Why are you ashamed
of your good impulses?

1086
01:26:29,372 --> 01:26:31,671
Maybe it's because
l don't get many.

1087
01:26:32,742 --> 01:26:34,835
You got a feIlow in Albuquerque?

1088
01:26:34,911 --> 01:26:39,610
l suppose you could caIl him that.
His name's Alfred. Works in a garage.

1089
01:26:39,682 --> 01:26:43,777
Grease monkey. No contest.
lt's a boat race.

1090
01:26:43,852 --> 01:26:45,787
He owns the garage.

1091
01:26:48,358 --> 01:26:50,792
Well, l better go.

1092
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:52,451
Thanks for everything.

1093
01:27:09,211 --> 01:27:12,180
Maybe l ought to start
rehearsing that number.

1094
01:27:12,246 --> 01:27:16,183
You mean, now that you're sober
you still wanna do the strip number?

1095
01:27:17,386 --> 01:27:19,650
Was it your idea...

1096
01:27:19,721 --> 01:27:21,382
or was it hers?

1097
01:27:21,456 --> 01:27:23,390
Of course it was my idea.

1098
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:27,188
l run the joint, don't l?
lt says "Chez Joey.''

1099
01:27:27,261 --> 01:27:30,356
All right then, if you really want
me to do it, then l'Il do it.

1100
01:27:30,432 --> 01:27:32,865
Good. l'm glad you decided to.

1101
01:28:35,962 --> 01:28:39,523
The first guy who drops a knife
on the opening gets it in the back.

1102
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,667
That's all, kids. Thank you.
Okay, next number.

1103
01:30:39,650 --> 01:30:41,584
l never thought she'd do it.

1104
01:30:41,653 --> 01:30:46,055
l've seen 'em come and go,
but l thought this girl was different.

1105
01:30:53,297 --> 01:30:54,662
Hold it.

1106
01:30:56,399 --> 01:30:57,866
Cut.

1107
01:30:58,936 --> 01:31:01,403
You can all stop drooling.

1108
01:31:01,471 --> 01:31:03,133
Put your clothes on.

1109
01:31:05,642 --> 01:31:09,009
Well, what do you know.
Prince valiant.

1110
01:31:09,079 --> 01:31:12,412
l'll hit you a shot in the head.
Get up and do the number.

1111
01:31:12,482 --> 01:31:14,075
A pIeasure.

1112
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:35,833
Here. Try this.
Blow your nose.

1113
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:39,101
l'm sorry.

1114
01:31:39,175 --> 01:31:42,440
Forget it.
lt was a nice try.

1115
01:31:42,512 --> 01:31:45,640
No, it wasn't. lt was awful.
l just wanted to die.

1116
01:31:45,715 --> 01:31:48,376
l know what you mean.

1117
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:50,714
l guess your mother was right.

1118
01:31:50,786 --> 01:31:54,951
A nice girl's a nice girl anywhere
and a bum is a bum.

1119
01:31:57,660 --> 01:31:59,958
l shouldn't have let you do it.

1120
01:32:04,868 --> 01:32:08,565
Fix your face and put on your dress.
We're gonna do the love song.

1121
01:32:15,978 --> 01:32:18,469
Joey, somebody wants to see you.

1122
01:32:24,218 --> 01:32:25,810
l won't be long.

1123
01:32:50,144 --> 01:32:52,773
Hi, doll. What's the rush?
l was rehearsing.

1124
01:32:54,348 --> 01:32:56,612
lt may not be necessary.

1125
01:32:57,719 --> 01:32:59,516
What do you mean?

1126
01:32:59,587 --> 01:33:02,887
You lied to me.
You told me she quit.

1127
01:33:04,491 --> 01:33:08,053
Well, she did,
but she decided to come back.

1128
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:11,655
Be reasonable, baby.

1129
01:33:11,733 --> 01:33:15,067
The mouse means nothing to me. She needs
the dough. She's got a sick mother.

1130
01:33:15,135 --> 01:33:17,071
Then tell her
to get Blue Cross.

1131
01:33:17,139 --> 01:33:18,695
Get her out.

1132
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:21,972
ls that an order?

1133
01:33:25,346 --> 01:33:26,712
Yes, it is.

1134
01:33:28,216 --> 01:33:31,879
- But l don't like orders.
- You'll obey or the club won't open.

1135
01:33:35,422 --> 01:33:39,359
You mean you'd shut the whole thing
over one stagestruck little broad?

1136
01:33:40,328 --> 01:33:43,091
lt isn't just one
stagestruck little broad.

1137
01:33:43,163 --> 01:33:47,156
lt's what she stands for.
You paraded her in front of everybody.

1138
01:33:47,234 --> 01:33:50,499
You made a fool of yourself--
of me!

1139
01:33:50,570 --> 01:33:53,766
Now go out there
and tell the girl she's through.

1140
01:33:55,276 --> 01:33:57,471
What are you waiting for?

1141
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:03,543
l told you something once.
l'm gonna tell it to you again.

1142
01:34:05,151 --> 01:34:07,551
Nobody owns Joey but Joey.

1143
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:13,015
l'll show you who owns Joey.

1144
01:34:17,730 --> 01:34:21,962
Mike, pay everybody off.
Chez Joey is not going to open.

1145
01:34:23,102 --> 01:34:25,366
And take down the sign.

1146
01:34:42,353 --> 01:34:44,914
Joey, shalI l break the news?

1147
01:34:45,991 --> 01:34:47,890
Thanks, Mike. l'll do it.

1148
01:34:51,096 --> 01:34:54,429
Mr. Evans, we have the house lights on
the dimmer system. lt's all checked out.

1149
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:56,092
Fine.

1150
01:34:57,168 --> 01:35:00,365
Mr. Evans, l've arranged
all the flowers like this.

1151
01:35:00,438 --> 01:35:02,372
They're lovely. Thank you.

1152
01:35:04,977 --> 01:35:08,174
- The tables will be ready for 7:30.
- Good.

1153
01:35:11,649 --> 01:35:13,981
Mike's okay now.
You wanna try it?

1154
01:35:14,052 --> 01:35:15,988
Yeah, l'll try it.

1155
01:35:25,264 --> 01:35:27,527
Gather around, kids.
l got something to tell you.

1156
01:35:27,599 --> 01:35:30,568
l got a short announcement to make,
and this is gonna kill you.

1157
01:35:32,102 --> 01:35:34,470
Don't look now,
but the joint's folded.

1158
01:35:38,309 --> 01:35:40,868
l told you you'd get
a big laugh out of it.

1159
01:35:42,213 --> 01:35:45,875
But l'm not kidding about it.
Chez Joey won't open tonight...

1160
01:35:45,949 --> 01:35:49,545
or tomorrow night
or any other night after that.

1161
01:35:50,954 --> 01:35:53,719
l'm sorry to tell you this, kids,
but the party's over.

1162
01:35:55,094 --> 01:35:58,358
The little lady picked up her marbles
and went home.

1163
01:36:22,185 --> 01:36:24,676
- l'm sorry.
- Beat it, kid.

1164
01:36:27,991 --> 01:36:31,358
l said beat it!
Leave me alone.

1165
01:37:07,596 --> 01:37:09,427
Someone to see you, madam.

1166
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:13,498
- Show him in.
- But it's a young lady, madam.

1167
01:37:13,569 --> 01:37:16,766
- A Miss English.
- Ask her to come in.

1168
01:37:21,143 --> 01:37:22,735
This way, miss.

1169
01:37:29,117 --> 01:37:30,813
You wanted to see me?

1170
01:37:30,885 --> 01:37:32,786
lt's about Joey.

1171
01:37:32,855 --> 01:37:34,982
l know how you feel.

1172
01:37:35,057 --> 01:37:37,490
And you're wrong.
There's been nothing between us.

1173
01:37:40,029 --> 01:37:42,396
Are you sure about that,
Miss English?

1174
01:37:42,466 --> 01:37:44,228
l am quite sure.

1175
01:37:45,668 --> 01:37:47,828
Let the club open, please.

1176
01:37:47,902 --> 01:37:50,200
You're not just punishing Joe. You're hurting
a lot of other people.

1177
01:37:50,271 --> 01:37:54,868
You're not concerned with other people.
lt's Joey. You're in love with him.

1178
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:56,467
Aren't you?

1179
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:01,313
Well, let's say
we understand each other.

1180
01:38:01,384 --> 01:38:04,375
We're alike, Joey and l--
the same breed of cat.

1181
01:38:04,452 --> 01:38:06,580
I'm not so sure of that.

1182
01:38:06,655 --> 01:38:10,215
Joey's better than you think.
He's better than he thinks.

1183
01:38:11,059 --> 01:38:13,720
Nobody's better than he thinks.

1184
01:38:15,663 --> 01:38:18,564
lt may come as quite a surprise,
Miss English, but...

1185
01:38:20,335 --> 01:38:22,826
l do believe there's been nothing
between you and Joey.

1186
01:38:22,903 --> 01:38:24,963
That makes you all
the more dangerous.

1187
01:38:25,039 --> 01:38:29,807
You may not know it, but when Joey told
you to keep your clothes on today...

1188
01:38:29,878 --> 01:38:32,744
he played the greatest love scene
of his career.

1189
01:38:36,151 --> 01:38:39,587
l could undress in the lobby
of the Fairmont Hotel and...

1190
01:38:39,654 --> 01:38:41,588
he'd never turn a hair.

1191
01:38:42,689 --> 01:38:45,249
So, you see, Miss English...

1192
01:38:46,361 --> 01:38:48,828
with you on the scene...

1193
01:38:48,897 --> 01:38:51,457
l couldn't possibly
reopen the cIub.

1194
01:38:52,499 --> 01:38:54,491
lf l wasn't on the scene?

1195
01:38:54,568 --> 01:38:58,265
Well, I might give it
serious consideration.

1196
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:03,035
After all, I rather enjoyed
owning a nightclub.

1197
01:39:04,144 --> 01:39:07,375
Of course, it wouldn't do to let our boy
know why you're leaving town.

1198
01:39:07,447 --> 01:39:10,645
He dislikes being
under any obligation...

1199
01:39:10,717 --> 01:39:13,311
except financial.

1200
01:39:54,627 --> 01:39:57,221
Why not? l earned them.

1201
01:40:04,403 --> 01:40:07,531
You can unpack, Joey.
l've changed my mind.

1202
01:40:11,109 --> 01:40:14,374
- l said l've changed my mind.
- l got ears.

1203
01:40:16,014 --> 01:40:18,847
But you don't understand.
lt's all right.

1204
01:40:18,917 --> 01:40:21,010
The club will open.

1205
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:23,918
lt won't happen again.

1206
01:40:23,990 --> 01:40:27,116
Sure. One false move and
l'm right out on my Frances.

1207
01:40:29,327 --> 01:40:30,919
That's not true.

1208
01:40:33,031 --> 01:40:36,660
very well. l'll prove it.

1209
01:40:36,734 --> 01:40:38,566
We'll get married.

1210
01:40:40,806 --> 01:40:45,173
Don't give me that marriage bit.
Don't do me any favors.

1211
01:40:45,242 --> 01:40:47,233
lt isn't a favor.

1212
01:40:47,311 --> 01:40:49,246
l want it that way.

1213
01:40:50,982 --> 01:40:53,075
So the lady wants it that way.

1214
01:40:53,151 --> 01:40:55,016
"Well, jump, Joey.''

1215
01:40:55,086 --> 01:40:58,054
Now, darling, Joey,
you've had your fun.

1216
01:40:59,023 --> 01:41:00,582
Can we go now?

1217
01:41:01,927 --> 01:41:06,091
l got a big flash for you, Mrs. Simpson.
You and me ain't goin' nowhere.

1218
01:41:06,164 --> 01:41:08,326
Don't take it so big.

1219
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:11,027
l'm doing you a big favor.

1220
01:41:13,672 --> 01:41:16,732
Darling, l--
l want to marry you.

1221
01:41:17,809 --> 01:41:20,208
Take more than a gold band
and a two-buck license...

1222
01:41:20,277 --> 01:41:22,872
to make an honest man
out of a bum like me.

1223
01:41:24,049 --> 01:41:27,108
That's a little job
l'm gonna have to work out myself.

1224
01:41:27,184 --> 01:41:29,118
Thanks for the use of the pad.

1225
01:41:38,929 --> 01:41:40,521
l guess that's that.

1226
01:41:42,266 --> 01:41:43,527
That's that.

1227
01:41:54,644 --> 01:41:56,579
ls it the mouse?

1228
01:41:58,948 --> 01:42:00,382
Maybe.

1229
01:42:03,386 --> 01:42:06,083
Maybe you should tell her.

1230
01:42:06,156 --> 01:42:10,525
What for?
Why should l louse up her life?

1231
01:42:49,464 --> 01:42:52,558
All of this could have been yours,
Joey-- the whole joint.

1232
01:42:54,103 --> 01:42:56,935
And you blew it
on account of two dames.

1233
01:42:57,005 --> 01:43:00,031
You never seem to learn,
do you, Joey?

1234
01:43:15,591 --> 01:43:17,057
Dames

1235
01:43:20,963 --> 01:43:23,931
What do I care for a dame

1236
01:43:24,232 --> 01:43:26,732
What do I care for a dame

1237
01:43:27,202 --> 01:43:30,296
Every old dame is the same

1238
01:43:30,372 --> 01:43:32,931
Every hokey dame is the same

1239
01:43:34,075 --> 01:43:36,908
l got a future
a rosy future

1240
01:43:36,978 --> 01:43:39,275
You can be sure I'll be tops

1241
01:43:40,448 --> 01:43:43,350
I'm independent
I'm no dependent

1242
01:43:43,417 --> 01:43:45,680
And l'll own a nightclub
that's tops

1243
01:43:46,921 --> 01:43:49,186
I'll be in with the cops

1244
01:43:51,726 --> 01:43:54,160
What do l care for the skirts

1245
01:43:58,032 --> 01:44:00,160
l'll make 'em pay
till it hurts

1246
01:44:01,501 --> 01:44:04,300
Let 'em put up
till it hurts

1247
01:44:04,373 --> 01:44:06,806
I'm gonna own a nightclub

1248
01:44:07,841 --> 01:44:10,366
It's gonna be
the right club

1249
01:44:10,444 --> 01:44:13,744
For the swell gentry
it's elementary

1250
01:44:13,814 --> 01:44:16,408
l'll wear a top hat and cane

1251
01:44:17,618 --> 01:44:21,213
In Chez Joey
They'll pay Joey

1252
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:23,279
The gay Joey

1253
01:44:23,357 --> 01:44:27,293
l can see it

1254
01:44:27,361 --> 01:44:29,295
Plain

1255
01:46:05,557 --> 01:46:08,720
So long, little bird.
Don't pick up any nails.

1256
01:46:26,578 --> 01:46:28,876
Where are we going?

1257
01:46:28,946 --> 01:46:30,880
What do you mean "we''?

1258
01:46:30,949 --> 01:46:33,314
We're both out of work,
aren't we?

1259
01:46:34,385 --> 01:46:37,354
l don't know about you,
but l'm on my way to Sacramento.

1260
01:46:37,421 --> 01:46:40,651
Fine. l've always wanted
to see the state capital.

1261
01:46:43,193 --> 01:46:46,891
Well, look, you asked me
to do the love song with you.

1262
01:46:46,963 --> 01:46:49,330
What are you trying to do,
crawl out of it?

1263
01:46:50,401 --> 01:46:53,802
- l thought we were good together.
- Are you out of your mind or something?

1264
01:46:53,871 --> 01:46:58,398
Know what you're getting into?
l'll brush you off before the station.

1265
01:46:58,476 --> 01:47:00,410
Why don't you beat it?

1266
01:47:03,614 --> 01:47:06,844
Look, l have no desire
to be hemmed in.

1267
01:47:06,917 --> 01:47:09,943
Now why don't you beat it?
Take the mutt with you.

1268
01:47:13,723 --> 01:47:16,658
Why don't you get out
while you got the chance?

1269
01:47:28,038 --> 01:47:33,305
What do you think l'm made of? Don't
you know l got a low boiling point?

1270
01:47:55,064 --> 01:47:58,057
Well, l guess we weren't
so bad at that, were we?

1271
01:47:58,132 --> 01:48:01,660
And l can use a girl in the act--
give it a little class.

1272
01:48:01,737 --> 01:48:05,264
- l could always do a strip.
- Don't bring that up again.

1273
01:48:05,341 --> 01:48:07,536
Well, how about my billing?

1274
01:48:07,609 --> 01:48:09,942
- Your what?
- My name? My picture?

1275
01:48:11,614 --> 01:48:15,414
Well, it'lI be "Joey Evans
and Linda English.''

1276
01:48:17,518 --> 01:48:19,986
Well, how about...

1277
01:48:20,055 --> 01:48:21,613
"Joey and Linda Evans''?

1278
01:48:21,690 --> 01:48:22,986
lt"s shorter.

1279
01:48:23,059 --> 01:48:25,618
l got a better idea.

1280
01:48:26,962 --> 01:48:30,955
How about "Joey Evans and Company''?
That's shorter still. Let's go.

1281
01:48:32,433 --> 01:48:36,028
And the simple secret
of the plot

1282
01:48:37,239 --> 01:48:41,174
ls just to tell them
that I love you a lot

1283
01:48:42,443 --> 01:48:47,643
Then the world discovers
as my book ends

1284
01:48:47,716 --> 01:48:51,583
How to make two lovers

1285
01:48:51,653 --> 01:48:54,144
of friends

1286
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:06,145
