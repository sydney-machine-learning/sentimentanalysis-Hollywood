1
00:03:46,373 --> 00:03:49,524
When I came back from leave,
everything looked the same...

2
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:51,968
...except the countryside
was already green.

3
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,442
I saw the old church in a cup
in the hills...

4
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:58,931
...and the mountains beyond, brown
mountains with green on their slopes.

5
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:07,203
The war slowed down
during the winter...

6
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:10,570
...but the troops still marched
with heavy cartridge boxes...

7
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,405
...bulging under their capes...

8
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:15,485
...as though they were
six months gone with child.

9
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:20,009
Our unit was stationed in the town
where we had been since autumn.

10
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:22,966
I was glad the Austrians
seemed to want to come back.

11
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:25,289
They did not bombard it
to destroy it...

12
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:28,405
...but only a little, in a military way.

13
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:38,446
Lieutenant!

14
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:42,123
Frederico! We miss you.

15
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,609
- Hi, Bonello.
- Look who's back. Signore lieutenant.

16
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:02,966
- Car's in good shape? How's this one?
- It's okay.

17
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:06,006
- Okay, number one.
- Having any trouble with the war?

18
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:10,292
No. Here in Orsino, the ambulance
company has no trouble with the war.

19
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:14,964
But up there, the war is bad.
Always bad.

20
00:05:15,173 --> 00:05:16,447
I know how you feel.

21
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:18,723
Give me my hat
to go play with the girls.

22
00:05:18,893 --> 00:05:21,407
Show me the girls and I go play.

23
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:25,810
I see nothing's changed.
How are you, Passini?

24
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:28,322
And you, Aymo.
Still causing trouble?

25
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:31,730
I, signore lieutenant? It is Passini
who keeps moaning.

26
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:34,845
You know what he told me
about you yesterday? He said:

27
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:37,089
"The lieutenant,
he don't come back."

28
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:40,291
He's wrong. I said
you don't come back...

29
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:43,132
...because Americans,
they're too smart.

30
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,006
Not all of them, maybe.
Think I'll check in.

31
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,443
Looks like you get along
better without me.

32
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:51,213
It's better to have an officer
to complain about.

33
00:05:51,573 --> 00:05:55,009
Here, take these things
in signore lieutenant's quarters.

34
00:06:06,053 --> 00:06:07,452
Come in.

35
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:16,169
Lieutenant Henry
reporting for duty, sir.

36
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:19,683
You'll never learn. It's not like this.
Like this.

37
00:06:21,973 --> 00:06:23,326
You're back in good time.

38
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:27,009
We expect to get a road
through the snow in a few weeks.

39
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:30,363
Then we move.
Glad you're back, lieutenant.

40
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:32,564
Thank you, Major Stampi.

41
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,489
Your chess has improved, doctor.

42
00:06:49,693 --> 00:06:52,844
God must have heard
my prayers for you.

43
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:00,332
Check.

44
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:06,523
What do you say, Father, if after
you die you find out there is no God?

45
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:10,328
I shall keep the bad news
to myself, major.

46
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:14,125
The papi returns.

47
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,052
Did you have a nice permission?
You're looking well.

48
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:20,131
Lying is a sin, Father.
Lieutenant Henry looks terrible.

49
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,643
One more kiss and he'd fall apart.

50
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:27,250
What's new? I hear from Major Stampi
we're almost ready to go.

51
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:30,206
Yes. Soon we march up the Alps,
down the Alps...

52
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:33,007
...capture Austria and finish the war.

53
00:07:33,213 --> 00:07:35,602
By God's mercy.

54
00:07:36,493 --> 00:07:38,404
A stubborn fellow.
Two years in war...

55
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:41,571
...and he still pretends
there is a God of mercy. Coffee?

56
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:44,008
- No, thanks.
- Did you see much of interest?

57
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:47,563
- Well, I saw some fine churches.
- From the outside, I hope.

58
00:07:47,773 --> 00:07:50,731
Perhaps someday when you have
the time, you'll enter one.

59
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:52,246
God is patient.

60
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:56,924
Tell me, did you go fishing in Abruzzi?
And did you see my family?

61
00:07:58,893 --> 00:08:01,487
I'm sorry, Father.
I meant to go to the Abruzzi...

62
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:03,843
...but things came up in Naples and...

63
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:07,762
We'll go together someday.
Perhaps Rini will go with us.

64
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:10,771
Yes. Unbelievers are sometimes
devout fishermen.

65
00:08:11,013 --> 00:08:14,369
- How are things at the hospital?
- Since you went away, nothing.

66
00:08:14,573 --> 00:08:17,451
Jaundice, pneumonia,
self-inflicted wounds.

67
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:19,963
And of course, venereal diseases.

68
00:08:20,173 --> 00:08:22,641
Always harder
to evade than enemy bullets.

69
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:25,492
But tell me, I can wait no longer.

70
00:08:25,693 --> 00:08:28,366
What kind of a time did you have?

71
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:31,292
- Great.
- Many beautiful girls?

72
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:34,605
- Enough.
- At your age, I never spoke that word.

73
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:37,850
I think perhaps we should finish
our game tomorrow, major.

74
00:08:38,053 --> 00:08:40,283
You are a good priest, but still a priest.

75
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,490
- I shall be happy to beat you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

76
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:46,253
- Frederico.
- So long, Father.

77
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:49,047
Now, where did you go
and what did you do?

78
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:51,767
- Tell me everything at once.
- I went everywhere.

79
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:54,567
Milan, Florence, Rome,
Naples, Taormina.

80
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:58,408
You talk like a timetable. Where was
the most beautiful adventure?

81
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:01,851
- Milan.
- Maybe because it was first.

82
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:05,011
She played the piano beautifully.

83
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:08,288
There is nothing like talent.

84
00:09:08,493 --> 00:09:12,725
I remember in Verona once,
a lady artist, a contortionist...

85
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:14,366
Oh, shut up.

86
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:18,805
I bore my friend, forgive me.
However, I have something of interest.

87
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:22,483
Here we have a big improvement
in the war situation.

88
00:09:23,173 --> 00:09:26,370
- We have beautiful English girls.
- Wonderful.

89
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:29,451
Yes, the British have opened
a new hospital near Orsino.

90
00:09:29,813 --> 00:09:34,170
I am now in love with one
of the nurses, Miss Barkley.

91
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:37,407
I have even thought
of marrying Miss Barkley...

92
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:40,650
...but I best confess,
she has one drawback:

93
00:09:41,453 --> 00:09:43,728
Her attitude is uncooperative.

94
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:47,049
You must be slipping.

95
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:51,122
No, but she is very strange,
very moody.

96
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,609
Who knows, she might even
prefer you to me.

97
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:57,085
You will meet her tomorrow.

98
00:09:57,293 --> 00:09:58,806
Have you any money?

99
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:01,481
- Fifty lire?
- In my wallet.

100
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:05,368
I must make the impression
of a man of sufficient wealth.

101
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:08,770
You are my great and good friend,
and financial protector.

102
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:13,331
- Don't overdo it.
- In case I change my mind...

103
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:16,684
...I will need this for the Villa Rosa.

104
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:19,283
Poor girls, they have missed me.

105
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:23,291
- You and 50 lire.
- And you...

106
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:26,724
Carmelina told me, "If Frederico
does not come back soon...

107
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:29,322
...we hang the Villa Rosa
in black bunting."

108
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:31,808
Oh, shut up about dames.

109
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:35,929
I can see you had
a successful vacation.

110
00:10:58,013 --> 00:10:59,526
Two new ones.

111
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:02,293
England is a great country.

112
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:10,166
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

113
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:12,972
I would like...
Excuse me.

114
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:22,772
- Miss Barkley? Good morning.
- Good morning, major.

115
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:26,488
May I present my young American
friend, Lieutenant Frederick Henry.

116
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,127
How do you do?

117
00:11:29,853 --> 00:11:31,252
Hello.

118
00:11:32,773 --> 00:11:35,890
Isn't it odd for an American
to be in the Italian army?

119
00:11:36,093 --> 00:11:38,084
It's not the army, only the ambulance.

120
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:42,287
- The ambulance is important service...
- It's very odd, though.

121
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,972
Why did you do it?

122
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:47,643
Oh, I missed out on a job
as war correspondent.

123
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:52,483
I didn't want to kill anybody, so I
tried the Red Cross, to have a look.

124
00:11:53,573 --> 00:11:56,531
- To have a look?
- Yes, I may want to do some writing.

125
00:11:56,853 --> 00:11:59,287
They assigned me
to the auto ambulance.

126
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:01,961
- End of story.
- With me, it's a different story.

127
00:12:02,173 --> 00:12:03,811
I am a lover of mankind...

128
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:07,244
- Major Rinaldi?
- Yes.

129
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:10,172
Dr. Gates would like to see you,
if you have time.

130
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:14,208
Yes, I have time. Will you pardon me?

131
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:16,483
Will you follow me please, doctor?

132
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:18,770
With pleasure.

133
00:12:25,573 --> 00:12:26,847
What's the stick?

134
00:12:27,053 --> 00:12:29,442
It belonged to a boy
who was killed last year.

135
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:31,884
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

136
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,686
He was a very nice boy.
He was going to marry me.

137
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:38,651
- He was killed in the Somme.
- That was a mean battle.

138
00:12:38,853 --> 00:12:41,048
His mother sent me the little stick.

139
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:43,164
They returned it with his things.

140
00:12:43,373 --> 00:12:45,682
- Were you engaged long?
- Eight years.

141
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:48,612
- We grew up together.
- Why didn't you marry him?

142
00:12:48,773 --> 00:12:51,731
I don't know. I was a fool not to.

143
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:54,603
Have you ever loved anyone?

144
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:56,531
Off and on.

145
00:12:58,973 --> 00:13:00,850
You have beautiful hair.

146
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,647
I was going to cut it all off
when he died.

147
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:05,366
That would've been a shame.

148
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:08,133
I wanted to do something for him.

149
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,245
He could've had anything
he wanted if I had known.

150
00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:14,365
I would have married him, or anything.

151
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:18,766
I thought it would be worse for him
to go to war if we were lovers.

152
00:13:18,973 --> 00:13:22,568
Then, of course, he was killed.
That was the end of it.

153
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:24,446
I don't know.

154
00:13:24,653 --> 00:13:27,486
Oh, yes. That's the end of it.

155
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:30,284
It's very beautiful here.

156
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:34,043
- Is it true they'll have an offensive?
- So I've heard.

157
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:37,928
Then we'll have some work.
There's no work now.

158
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:41,131
- Done nursing long?
- Since the end of ' 15.

159
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:44,368
I started when he did.

160
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:48,971
I remember having a silly idea he might
come to the hospital where I was.

161
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:52,483
With a saber cut, I suppose,
and a bandage around his head.

162
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:56,447
- It doesn't happen like that.
- No, he didn't have a saber cut.

163
00:13:56,653 --> 00:13:58,848
They blew him all to bits.

164
00:14:00,613 --> 00:14:04,288
- Do you suppose it will always go on?
- No.

165
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:08,088
- What's to stop it?
- It'll crack somewhere.

166
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:11,605
It really doesn't matter.
We die anyway.

167
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:13,485
It takes a while.

168
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:15,445
You think so?

169
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:18,607
Will you excuse me?
I have to go now.

170
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:25,652
Miss Barkley...

171
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:47,003
I have been thinking
about Miss Barkley.

172
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:49,773
She has beauty and mystery,
but she is not for us.

173
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:53,323
Miss Barkley is not only a woman,
she is a problem.

174
00:14:54,013 --> 00:14:57,403
- It is not a good mixture.
- Your lectures throw me off.

175
00:14:58,213 --> 00:15:00,204
Well, gentlemen, I have news.

176
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:03,132
Tomorrow morning,
rain or shine, we advance.

177
00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:07,401
We advance in the morning, and I am
wasting time with a billiard ball.

178
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:09,729
With this news,
it will be impossible...

179
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:12,083
...to get into Villa Rosa
with a shoehorn.

180
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:14,204
You go. I'm not in the mood.

181
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:18,008
This is madness. Tomorrow night,
you will be in the Alps, freezing.

182
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:20,568
You'll need a few warm memories.

183
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,368
I am stupid. The British.

184
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:27,770
You are going to call on Miss Barkley
in spite of my warnings.

185
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:30,845
- Father Galli, I need your help.
- Yes, major.

186
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:35,285
Tell our friend if he sees Miss Barkley
three times, he'll have to marry her.

187
00:15:35,493 --> 00:15:37,882
Tell him. It is a British law.

188
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:40,886
And that is not all.
After marriage, children.

189
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:45,365
There is no end to the disasters
the British can bring down on Frederico.

190
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:48,133
I am hardly in a position
to discourage marriage.

191
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:51,485
Are you coming, papi?
I offer you a last reprieve.

192
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:54,412
I'll see you tomorrow in the parade.

193
00:15:54,613 --> 00:15:56,092
All right.

194
00:15:56,493 --> 00:15:59,212
But if all does not go well...

195
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:02,452
...you know where I am.
Good night, gentlemen.

196
00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:04,684
- Good night, major.
- Good night, major.

197
00:16:14,213 --> 00:16:18,047
- Miss Barkley will be down directly.
- Thank you very much.

198
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:38,649
- They look like a mausoleum.
- What did you say?

199
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:42,528
I said these busts
look like a cemetery.

200
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:47,886
- Bad for the patients, I should think.
- I think the busts are rather handsome.

201
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:50,004
By the way, you know
that our girls...

202
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:53,006
...are not permitted to leave
during the evening?

203
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:56,404
The Italians do not approve
of women being so near the front.

204
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:58,604
That's pretty silly of them, isn't it?

205
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:00,446
No.

206
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,609
I'm inclined to think they're right.

207
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:19,771
- Good evening.
- Hello, Miss Barkley.

208
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:22,009
Is there any place we can go?

209
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:23,726
Why?

210
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:28,129
Well, I'd... I'd like to see you.

211
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:33,522
Well, l... I suppose we could walk
in the garden, unless it rains.

212
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,689
Well, it's not raining now.

213
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:48,531
Thank you.

214
00:17:54,493 --> 00:17:57,166
They certainly have difficult rules
for you nurses.

215
00:17:57,373 --> 00:18:00,445
I'm not really a nurse.
I'm something called V.A.D.

216
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:03,406
- What's the difference?
- A nurse is like a doctor.

217
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:07,606
It takes a long time to be one.
A V.A.D. Is a shortcut. For war only.

218
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:10,162
Well, a lot of things are for war only.

219
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:13,089
Why did you want to see me?

220
00:18:14,613 --> 00:18:16,763
Isn't that rather obvious?

221
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:19,123
You mean, to have a look?

222
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,210
You're nice looking at.

223
00:18:21,613 --> 00:18:24,446
Frankly, I didn't like your attitude
about the war.

224
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:28,931
- Some people joined for other reasons.
- You mean a better world, and all that?

225
00:18:29,133 --> 00:18:33,285
Yes. Seems rather foolish
to you, doesn't it?

226
00:18:34,453 --> 00:18:37,809
You mustn't take things too hard.
It's a short life, at best.

227
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:40,886
- Yes, I think that too.
- Then why not enjoy it?

228
00:18:41,093 --> 00:18:42,765
Let's drop the war.

229
00:18:42,973 --> 00:18:45,931
- There's no place to drop it.
- Let's drop it anyway.

230
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:47,407
- Please.
- Why not?

231
00:18:47,653 --> 00:18:49,484
- It's so meaningless.
- No, it's not.

232
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:53,248
People who don't even know each other.
I don't like it. I never have.

233
00:18:57,853 --> 00:18:59,332
I'm sorry.

234
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:01,925
That's all right.

235
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,288
I'm dreadfully sorry.

236
00:19:05,493 --> 00:19:09,532
I just couldn't stand
the "nurse's evening off" aspect of it.

237
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:11,885
I didn't mean to hurt you.

238
00:19:12,493 --> 00:19:15,371
- I did hurt you, didn't I?
- No harm done.

239
00:19:15,573 --> 00:19:17,529
It's happened before.

240
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,528
You poor man.

241
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:23,008
You mean girls usually slap you?

242
00:19:23,853 --> 00:19:25,127
Well, not always.

243
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:27,765
You don't mind when they do?

244
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,363
It's more interesting when they don't.

245
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:33,488
Especially when they're
as beautiful as you.

246
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:35,923
You don't have to say
a lot of nonsense.

247
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,089
I said I was sorry.

248
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:42,491
I suppose I might have waited
until we knew each other.

249
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:45,491
- Lf only there'd been time.
- You're leaving?

250
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:47,285
We all are.

251
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:50,167
- When?
- In the morning.

252
00:20:10,013 --> 00:20:11,526
It's raining.

253
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:13,685
This is closer.

254
00:20:25,773 --> 00:20:28,731
- You're trembling.
- It's nothing.

255
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:32,084
- What is it?
- It's nothing, really.

256
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:35,411
Tell me.

257
00:20:37,093 --> 00:20:41,689
It's only that l... I've always been
afraid of the rain.

258
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:43,686
Why?

259
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:47,206
- I don't know.
- Tell me.

260
00:20:48,693 --> 00:20:50,046
Don't make me.

261
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:54,886
Tell me.

262
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:02,763
I'm afraid of the rain because
sometimes I see myself dead in it.

263
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:18,645
Hold me.

264
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:21,010
Hold me.

265
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:27,331
Say, "I've come back to Catherine
in the night."

266
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:31,682
"I've come back to Catherine
in the night."

267
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:35,522
Oh, darling, you have come back,
haven't you?

268
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:38,048
- Yes.
- I love you so...

269
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:40,403
It's been awful.

270
00:21:58,813 --> 00:22:03,523
It's very funny, really,
happening to me like this.

271
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:06,372
Not with someone I loved
for years and years.

272
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,728
With someone I've just met.

273
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:10,844
A stranger.

274
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:14,410
Your name is Frederick Henry,
isn't it?

275
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:18,003
Don't talk that way, please.
You're so sweet.

276
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,169
You don't have to play any games.

277
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:23,046
I'm not playing any games.
I'm in love with you.

278
00:22:23,253 --> 00:22:25,369
I wasn't kissing you.

279
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:27,451
I thought...

280
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:29,970
It sounds mad.

281
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:33,372
I thought he'd come back to me
in the night.

282
00:22:33,573 --> 00:22:35,086
Catherine, darling...

283
00:22:35,573 --> 00:22:37,291
"Catherine."

284
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:40,007
You don't pronounce
it very much alike.

285
00:22:40,813 --> 00:22:43,008
But you're a very nice boy.

286
00:22:43,213 --> 00:22:46,569
I'm glad you're nice. But you
don't have to pretend you love me.

287
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:49,372
- That's over for the evening.
- I'm not pretending...

288
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:52,525
I'm not mad and I'm not gone off.

289
00:22:52,973 --> 00:22:55,407
It's only a little sometimes.

290
00:22:55,613 --> 00:22:58,081
Now you can go to war
and forget all about this.

291
00:22:58,613 --> 00:23:02,367
- I'll come back to you.
- Please, you make it worse.

292
00:23:02,893 --> 00:23:06,852
I hope the advance is not too difficult.
That you don't get hurt.

293
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,486
Please.

294
00:23:08,893 --> 00:23:10,884
Don't go away like this.

295
00:23:13,773 --> 00:23:15,445
Good night.

296
00:24:55,413 --> 00:24:58,530
I'm sorry, papi, but we must leave.

297
00:26:11,413 --> 00:26:15,565
Lieutenant Henry. Lieutenant Henry!

298
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:17,724
Lieutenant Henry!

299
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:19,207
Take the wheel.

300
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:29,366
- Do you love me, truly?
- I'm mad for you.

301
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:34,001
Come back. Promise you'll come back.

302
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:37,046
- I promise.
- Promise you won't leave me behind.

303
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:47,532
Goodbye, darling. I'll be waiting.

304
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:40,252
We're liable to be up in these hills
a long time.

305
00:27:40,653 --> 00:27:43,850
Well, baby, it will seem longer
to you.

306
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:46,766
Do you think we have
to capture all the Alps?

307
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:50,449
You sound as if Miss Barkley
had been very cooperative.

308
00:27:50,653 --> 00:27:53,451
- Shut up.
- Tell me. It will make you feel better.

309
00:27:53,613 --> 00:27:54,807
- Did she...?
- Shut up.

310
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:58,932
- I am a man of extreme delicacy...
- lf you wanna be my friend, shut up.

311
00:27:59,093 --> 00:28:02,369
I don't want to be your friend.
I am your friend.

312
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:05,044
An envious one.

313
00:28:05,453 --> 00:28:09,241
It's a long time since I had anyone
to say goodbye to.

314
00:28:39,653 --> 00:28:41,405
They slow down.

315
00:28:41,973 --> 00:28:44,362
Maybe they changed their minds.

316
00:28:45,053 --> 00:28:47,931
- You think they like to attack?
- Nobody likes to attack.

317
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:50,203
- I like to attack.
- Then you are stupid.

318
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:53,530
The great Passini reads books.
Knows everything.

319
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:56,531
- Better than knowing nothing.
- Everybody's stupid.

320
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:58,803
Fighting is stupid.

321
00:28:59,013 --> 00:29:01,732
- War is stupid.
- He's right.

322
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:05,608
He's right. What are we doing here?

323
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:18,167
The field hospitals, lieutenant.

324
00:29:20,653 --> 00:29:22,883
There's your sawmill, doctor.

325
00:29:24,093 --> 00:29:25,845
Good luck up there.

326
00:29:27,053 --> 00:29:28,645
See you again, major.

327
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:35,572
Bonello, I'll drive for a while.
Passini, you and Aymo hop in the back.

328
00:32:02,013 --> 00:32:05,847
- Is good, the blessing, no?
- It can't hurt.

329
00:32:29,893 --> 00:32:33,886
Turn the ambulances around before
you come in. Fill the gas tanks too.

330
00:32:34,093 --> 00:32:38,928
- Hey, we ought to clean the plugs.
- Yes, that will win the war.

331
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,051
Very fine.

332
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:43,289
We sleep in the snow.

333
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:12,243
Beg your pardon, captain.
Thought I'd come up and have a look.

334
00:33:12,413 --> 00:33:14,404
Our front lines are just below.

335
00:33:16,213 --> 00:33:19,523
The enemy is on that ridge facing us.

336
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:24,371
Fire!

337
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:49,731
They're trying to get
our supply depot.

338
00:33:56,573 --> 00:33:58,131
I better get down.

339
00:33:58,293 --> 00:33:59,806
Looks like we'll be busy.

340
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:02,362
Take a cable car!

341
00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:06,485
Fire!

342
00:34:21,053 --> 00:34:22,566
Get the ambulances ready!

343
00:34:22,733 --> 00:34:24,963
Passini, open those doors!

344
00:34:37,973 --> 00:34:40,407
Take it easy, Passini.

345
00:35:15,173 --> 00:35:16,765
Passini.

346
00:35:21,493 --> 00:35:23,688
Shoot.

347
00:35:23,853 --> 00:35:25,650
Stop it.

348
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:29,808
Lieutenant Henry, are you all right?

349
00:35:30,013 --> 00:35:32,004
Passini.

350
00:35:37,693 --> 00:35:40,765
- Mother of God, no!
- Shut up.

351
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:42,491
Give me a hand.

352
00:35:56,013 --> 00:35:59,085
Put signore lieutenant on the bottom,
the other man on top.

353
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:08,049
- Does it hurt?
- No. Let's go!

354
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:10,488
Hold on, lieutenant.

355
00:36:38,373 --> 00:36:40,807
Bonello? Hey, Bonello!

356
00:36:40,973 --> 00:36:44,090
- What's the matter?
- The man over me has a hemorrhage.

357
00:36:44,253 --> 00:36:48,292
Then I'll go fast, signore lieutenant.
We're not far from the hospital.

358
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,687
How's the man on top,
signore lieutenant?

359
00:37:04,493 --> 00:37:06,723
He's dead, I think.

360
00:37:06,893 --> 00:37:08,167
Almost there.

361
00:37:25,733 --> 00:37:28,645
- How are you, baby?
- What do you think?

362
00:37:28,853 --> 00:37:30,923
The pain hasn't started yet.

363
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:33,124
A good thing to know.

364
00:37:33,853 --> 00:37:35,764
A present for you, papi.

365
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:38,528
The best cognac in Italy.

366
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:41,651
What's happening with the mountain?
Have we taken it yet?

367
00:37:41,813 --> 00:37:46,011
Fifty thousand Italians are now
freezing triumphantly on its top.

368
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:48,602
Father Galli's here
with his breath of heaven.

369
00:37:48,773 --> 00:37:50,047
- Hello, Frederico.
- Hello.

370
00:37:50,213 --> 00:37:52,044
Our papi's going to be all right.

371
00:37:52,213 --> 00:37:54,773
- I'm happy to hear that.
- I have other good news.

372
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:59,046
Lieutenant Henry will be moved
to the new American hospital in Milan.

373
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:02,005
No, Rini.

374
00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:03,806
I wanna be sent to Orsino.

375
00:38:04,013 --> 00:38:05,571
It is not in my hands.

376
00:38:05,733 --> 00:38:08,372
All wounded Americans
have been ordered to Milan.

377
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:10,728
Why shouldn't you want to be?

378
00:38:13,453 --> 00:38:15,762
I am very stupid.

379
00:38:15,933 --> 00:38:18,003
It is not geography.

380
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:20,243
It is Miss Barkley.

381
00:38:21,013 --> 00:38:23,573
- I'm going to Orsino.
- Relax.

382
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:25,166
I will see what can be done.

383
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:28,564
Between Father Galli and me,
we will move heaven and earth...

384
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:31,930
...to send Miss Barkley to Milan.

385
00:38:32,453 --> 00:38:34,489
- Orderly.
- Yes, major.

386
00:38:34,653 --> 00:38:38,043
Lieutenant Henry is the
illegitimate son of President Wilson.

387
00:38:38,213 --> 00:38:40,522
Keep the bugs off him.

388
00:38:47,013 --> 00:38:48,765
You are not in pain?

389
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:50,924
Feels better.

390
00:38:52,253 --> 00:38:55,051
I will pray for your quick recovery.

391
00:38:55,773 --> 00:38:57,650
I hope he hears you.

392
00:38:58,133 --> 00:38:59,771
He hears if you love him.

393
00:39:00,973 --> 00:39:03,646
Perhaps from Milan you'll go home.

394
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,846
You too...

395
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:08,447
...to the Abruzzi country.

396
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:11,571
Next time, I'll join you there.

397
00:39:11,773 --> 00:39:16,164
Yes, we'll go fishing together
in a stream below our house.

398
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:20,167
- There's a river up in Wisconsin.
- There are fine rivers everywhere.

399
00:39:20,373 --> 00:39:23,331
In Abruzzi, perhaps some of the best.

400
00:39:23,493 --> 00:39:25,404
And the people...

401
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:28,371
...kind with a smile for God.

402
00:39:29,853 --> 00:39:33,482
The springtime
is the most beautiful in Italy.

403
00:39:33,653 --> 00:39:36,292
But the fall is even more lovely.

404
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,005
Sleep well, my friend...

405
00:39:45,173 --> 00:39:48,768
...and may God bring you to your river.

406
00:40:19,653 --> 00:40:21,644
Get the porter.

407
00:40:34,093 --> 00:40:35,970
Where did he go?

408
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:42,052
- There you are.
- Yeah, big surprise.

409
00:40:51,173 --> 00:40:53,403
That's my sore leg, you fool!

410
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:57,931
Excuse me.

411
00:41:18,293 --> 00:41:20,761
- Watch what you're doing.
- Excuse me.

412
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:30,965
- Take him up.
- Go easy.

413
00:41:32,693 --> 00:41:35,082
Don't worry, we get you upstairs.

414
00:41:35,253 --> 00:41:36,811
Alive!

415
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:47,450
Easy, now.

416
00:41:55,453 --> 00:41:57,250
He won't fit.

417
00:41:59,773 --> 00:42:01,684
- You gotta put the leg down.
- I can't.

418
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,889
I help you.

419
00:42:04,413 --> 00:42:06,449
No. No!

420
00:42:06,653 --> 00:42:09,008
Hey, stop it.

421
00:42:09,893 --> 00:42:11,372
He fits now.

422
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:14,528
Sorry, lieutenant, no room.

423
00:42:14,693 --> 00:42:17,002
My leg. Put my leg up.

424
00:42:17,613 --> 00:42:20,491
Americans, lots of trouble.

425
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:31,927
- You got any idea where you're going?
- I think we have some beds up here.

426
00:42:37,293 --> 00:42:39,204
Nobody here. What do we do?

427
00:42:39,373 --> 00:42:42,570
- I'll find somebody.
- Good idea.

428
00:42:44,413 --> 00:42:46,085
Here she is.

429
00:42:46,293 --> 00:42:48,045
- Lieutenant Henry?
- Yeah.

430
00:42:48,213 --> 00:42:49,487
You're our first patient.

431
00:42:49,653 --> 00:42:52,247
Your doctor in Orsino
notified me of your coming.

432
00:42:52,413 --> 00:42:55,211
- I'm Miss Van Campen, superintendent.
- How do you do?

433
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:57,807
- This is Miss Ferguson.
- How do you do?

434
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:11,401
The room at the end of the hall,
porter.

435
00:43:13,733 --> 00:43:17,089
- Are there any other nurses here?
- Just Miss Ferguson and myself.

436
00:43:17,253 --> 00:43:19,483
I think we're enough for one patient.

437
00:43:19,653 --> 00:43:22,929
- Do you expect any other nurses?
- Just the two of us.

438
00:43:25,613 --> 00:43:27,331
That bed.

439
00:43:30,853 --> 00:43:32,730
You fool!

440
00:43:32,933 --> 00:43:34,525
Come on.

441
00:43:37,373 --> 00:43:38,806
Sorry, lieutenant.

442
00:43:38,973 --> 00:43:41,931
Excuse me, lieutenant.
Sorry.

443
00:43:49,253 --> 00:43:50,652
- Get out.
- I'm sorry...

444
00:43:50,813 --> 00:43:53,008
Get out of here!

445
00:43:59,693 --> 00:44:03,163
Undress and bathe him, Miss Ferguson.
And bring a nightgown.

446
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:06,803
- I'll undress and bathe myself.
- Nonsense.

447
00:44:09,453 --> 00:44:12,251
- Would you like to use the bedpan?
- No!

448
00:44:14,453 --> 00:44:17,013
- When does a doctor get here?
- When he gets back.

449
00:44:17,173 --> 00:44:19,812
We've telephoned
to Lake Como for him.

450
00:44:20,613 --> 00:44:22,490
I'm hungry. How's the food?

451
00:44:22,653 --> 00:44:24,405
We find it quite satisfactory.

452
00:44:24,613 --> 00:44:27,491
- Can I have wine with my meals?
- No!

453
00:44:32,213 --> 00:44:33,487
Open your mouth.

454
00:44:33,653 --> 00:44:37,692
- Let's see how sick you really are.
- I'm not sick, I'm wounded!

455
00:44:40,733 --> 00:44:43,167
I need a drink.
Why can't I have one?

456
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:45,642
Because I said absolutely not.

457
00:44:47,573 --> 00:44:49,803
That's rather infantile.

458
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:53,724
Turn him over, Miss Ferguson.

459
00:44:53,893 --> 00:44:56,726
Let's see if he can break it that way.

460
00:45:26,573 --> 00:45:28,484
- Did you get it?
- Yes, sir.

461
00:45:28,653 --> 00:45:30,564
I ran the blockade.

462
00:45:30,773 --> 00:45:33,731
- Now, turn away.
- I'm over 21.

463
00:45:35,773 --> 00:45:38,003
- Here.
- It's a pity.

464
00:45:38,173 --> 00:45:39,845
They were very becoming.

465
00:45:41,373 --> 00:45:44,649
Don't let Van Campen catch
you guzzling. We'll both get life.

466
00:45:44,813 --> 00:45:47,407
- Find out anything about Miss Barkley?
- Yes.

467
00:45:47,573 --> 00:45:49,131
- Indeed.
- What'd you find out?

468
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:52,450
Oh, look at him.
The bedridden Romeo.

469
00:45:52,613 --> 00:45:55,605
Miss Barkley is arriving
on the 8:00 train.

470
00:45:55,773 --> 00:45:58,003
She's coming? You're not kidding?

471
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,090
Boy, she must be something.

472
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:03,372
That's the barber.
I figured you could use a shave.

473
00:46:03,533 --> 00:46:05,330
Always helps a reunion.

474
00:46:20,813 --> 00:46:22,644
Hello.

475
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:24,690
Hello.

476
00:46:28,933 --> 00:46:30,651
You sweet...

477
00:46:30,813 --> 00:46:32,769
You're wonderful to come here.

478
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:42,733
Come here, please.

479
00:46:42,893 --> 00:46:46,681
- Did they operate yet?
- No. Forget about that. Please, darling.

480
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:51,571
- You mustn't.
- I'm crazy about you.

481
00:46:58,613 --> 00:47:00,649
Oh, darling.

482
00:47:02,093 --> 00:47:03,845
You do love me?

483
00:47:04,013 --> 00:47:06,004
I adore you.

484
00:47:07,813 --> 00:47:09,610
Come on, please.

485
00:47:09,773 --> 00:47:11,172
But do you really love me?

486
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:14,006
Don't keep saying that.
Please, Catherine.

487
00:47:27,613 --> 00:47:29,649
Shut the door.

488
00:47:30,773 --> 00:47:33,082
Don't talk. Please, Catherine.

489
00:47:33,253 --> 00:47:35,130
I love you.

490
00:47:53,653 --> 00:47:55,371
Darling.

491
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:02,812
Smooth.

492
00:49:05,013 --> 00:49:08,005
Smooth as piano keys.

493
00:49:09,053 --> 00:49:10,372
Smooth.

494
00:49:11,333 --> 00:49:14,006
Smooth as emery paper.

495
00:49:14,853 --> 00:49:18,004
- Is it rough?
- No, darling.

496
00:49:18,173 --> 00:49:20,528
I was just making fun of you.

497
00:49:22,853 --> 00:49:25,367
I have to go now, darling.

498
00:49:26,093 --> 00:49:28,846
I'm crazy in love with you.

499
00:49:29,053 --> 00:49:30,406
You're sure?

500
00:49:30,573 --> 00:49:33,246
- You're sure you love me?
- Very sure.

501
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:39,532
- You'll be good to me, won't you?
- Of course I will.

502
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:42,008
You will, won't you?

503
00:49:42,853 --> 00:49:46,084
Because we're going to
have a strange life.

504
00:49:47,093 --> 00:49:49,004
Strange?

505
00:49:51,173 --> 00:49:53,971
But it's the only life I want.

506
00:50:10,293 --> 00:50:13,012
It is an honor to attend
a friend of Rinaldi.

507
00:50:13,213 --> 00:50:15,124
I was his chief at the university.

508
00:50:15,293 --> 00:50:19,206
From the start he revealed
a talent for female anatomy.

509
00:50:21,213 --> 00:50:23,773
Tell me what the x-rays show, please.

510
00:50:23,973 --> 00:50:26,123
The x-ray.

511
00:50:27,853 --> 00:50:30,447
I think it'd be safer
if we don't open the knee...

512
00:50:30,613 --> 00:50:34,652
...until the foreign bodies are encysted.
That will take five or six months.

513
00:50:34,813 --> 00:50:37,373
I'm not lying around
like a dummy for six months.

514
00:50:37,533 --> 00:50:42,891
Perhaps we will know a little more
about how long, after our examination.

515
00:50:43,053 --> 00:50:45,248
Is she your girl, young man?

516
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:48,528
I'm her fella.

517
00:50:48,693 --> 00:50:50,365
I thought so.

518
00:50:52,453 --> 00:50:54,921
Injury and death. Death and injury.

519
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:57,926
I have been standing
over them for 30 years.

520
00:50:58,093 --> 00:51:00,812
But the war changes
the picture a little.

521
00:51:00,973 --> 00:51:05,046
Youth instead of age
requires my services.

522
00:51:05,213 --> 00:51:09,252
What a shame to waste
young legs as targets.

523
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:13,201
What does the x-ray
of the right kneecap show?

524
00:51:13,373 --> 00:51:16,683
- The kneecap is free.
- What?

525
00:51:16,853 --> 00:51:19,367
No foreign substance
until we come to the calf.

526
00:51:19,533 --> 00:51:22,445
You are mad. I can see
the shrapnel with my naked eye.

527
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:24,843
I'm sorry, colonel,
there is nothing there.

528
00:51:25,013 --> 00:51:28,926
All the right leg needs
is a few minor probes to the calf.

529
00:51:29,093 --> 00:51:33,052
- This is the x-ray of the left leg.
- Impossible.

530
00:51:33,213 --> 00:51:35,966
To a medical genius,
nothing is impossible.

531
00:51:36,133 --> 00:51:38,601
Now, kindly look at the leg
under discussion...

532
00:51:38,773 --> 00:51:43,130
...the right one, please,
and describe its contents.

533
00:51:44,253 --> 00:51:46,483
She is a lovely girl.

534
00:51:46,653 --> 00:51:50,441
I'll do all your obstetrical work
free, up to the third baby.

535
00:51:50,613 --> 00:51:53,730
After that there will be a small fee.

536
00:51:53,933 --> 00:51:57,369
The ankle is curiously swollen
and full of foreign bodies.

537
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:00,531
- What ankle?
- The right one, here.

538
00:52:01,973 --> 00:52:04,089
That is not an ankle.

539
00:52:04,253 --> 00:52:08,405
- That's the knee in question.
- Of course.

540
00:52:08,573 --> 00:52:11,451
- I was holding the plate upside down.
- Natural mistake.

541
00:52:11,613 --> 00:52:14,286
Next time, hand me the plate
in the proper position.

542
00:52:14,453 --> 00:52:16,489
- Right-side up.
- How about it, doctor?

543
00:52:16,693 --> 00:52:19,366
Do I have to wait six months
for an operation?

544
00:52:19,533 --> 00:52:23,924
Well, I think we can
get to you a little sooner.

545
00:52:24,093 --> 00:52:26,812
- Say, tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

546
00:52:27,373 --> 00:52:30,365
- Yes.
- Good work.

547
00:52:30,533 --> 00:52:33,889
- We'll meet at 10 in the morning.
- See you on the chopping block.

548
00:52:34,053 --> 00:52:37,284
I leave you in good hands.
Love is the best medicine.

549
00:52:37,453 --> 00:52:40,889
- Good evening, happy people.
- Good night.

550
00:52:41,693 --> 00:52:43,570
Oh, doctor...

551
00:52:43,733 --> 00:52:46,327
...thank you for your assistance.

552
00:52:49,173 --> 00:52:53,769
If I can be of any further help to you,
doctor, don't hesitate to call on me.

553
00:52:57,613 --> 00:52:59,205
I have duties.

554
00:52:59,373 --> 00:53:01,364
I have to get you ready.

555
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:05,283
I don't want anyone else
to touch you.

556
00:53:06,413 --> 00:53:09,723
I know I'm silly,
but I'll be furious if they touch you.

557
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:13,767
Now, just a little advice:

558
00:53:13,933 --> 00:53:16,731
When you're going under ether,
don't think about us...

559
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:20,203
...because people get very blabby
under an anesthetic.

560
00:53:20,373 --> 00:53:23,046
Think of something very unpleasant...

561
00:53:23,213 --> 00:53:24,646
...or say your prayers.

562
00:53:24,813 --> 00:53:27,691
That'll create a splendid impression.

563
00:53:27,893 --> 00:53:29,565
I won't talk. Not a chance.

564
00:53:30,653 --> 00:53:34,692
Don't brag. You're very sweet,
you don't have to brag.

565
00:53:35,973 --> 00:53:38,362
You have such a lovely temperature.

566
00:53:38,573 --> 00:53:40,803
I like yours better.

567
00:53:40,973 --> 00:53:44,124
I'm awfully proud
of your temperature.

568
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:47,564
Maybe all our children
will have fine temperatures.

569
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:53,008
Our children will probably
have beastly temperatures.

570
00:53:56,693 --> 00:53:59,002
Tonight? Please.

571
00:53:59,173 --> 00:54:02,245
For tonight,
the chart indicates a few drugs...

572
00:54:02,413 --> 00:54:04,608
...a bath...

573
00:54:04,773 --> 00:54:06,843
...and an emetic.

574
00:54:07,733 --> 00:54:09,530
Nothing else.

575
00:54:20,933 --> 00:54:24,608
He'll be out of the ether soon.
Couldn't ask for a better operation.

576
00:54:24,813 --> 00:54:26,565
Don't jiggle him.

577
00:54:31,493 --> 00:54:33,211
Catherine.

578
00:54:33,413 --> 00:54:35,324
Come here.

579
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:38,685
Van Campen is listening.
You better muzzle your Romeo.

580
00:54:38,853 --> 00:54:40,889
Catherine, come here.

581
00:54:41,053 --> 00:54:43,283
Our patient seems to have
a one-track mind.

582
00:54:43,453 --> 00:54:45,728
If she hears him, you're sunk.

583
00:54:45,933 --> 00:54:48,083
Catherine, come here...

584
00:55:00,613 --> 00:55:04,288
Can you imagine anyone making wine
because it tastes like strawberries?

585
00:55:04,453 --> 00:55:07,013
Why shouldn't they?
It sounds splendid.

586
00:55:07,173 --> 00:55:09,971
But it doesn't even taste
like strawberries.

587
00:55:10,133 --> 00:55:13,330
Next time, if I don't seem
too ungrateful, I'd like brandy.

588
00:55:13,493 --> 00:55:16,326
Oh, no.
It's much too strong for you.

589
00:55:17,133 --> 00:55:19,169
Tell you what I'll do, Cat.

590
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:22,643
Get me another bottle
of brandy and I'll marry you.

591
00:55:23,413 --> 00:55:26,849
Just for a bottle of brandy
you'd make an honest woman of me?

592
00:55:27,013 --> 00:55:32,212
No, as a matter of fact, I'll marry you
even if you do bring me this vile stuff.

593
00:55:33,013 --> 00:55:34,571
No.

594
00:55:35,573 --> 00:55:38,724
- We're not going to be married.
- Yes, we are.

595
00:55:39,853 --> 00:55:41,445
Darling...

596
00:55:41,613 --> 00:55:44,764
...I'd rather marry you
than do anything in the world.

597
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:49,449
- Lf we do, they'll send me away.
- Who says?

598
00:55:49,653 --> 00:55:51,962
Wives are not allowed at the front.

599
00:55:52,173 --> 00:55:55,927
Aren't you embarrassed
about not being married?

600
00:55:56,133 --> 00:55:57,646
No.

601
00:55:58,253 --> 00:55:59,732
See, darling...

602
00:55:59,893 --> 00:56:02,965
...it would mean everything
to me if I had any religion.

603
00:56:03,133 --> 00:56:05,124
But you're my only religion.

604
00:56:05,293 --> 00:56:07,648
You're all I've got.

605
00:56:13,253 --> 00:56:14,971
It's going to rain.

606
00:56:16,893 --> 00:56:18,770
Cat, darling.

607
00:56:18,933 --> 00:56:22,846
It's all nonsense.
I'm not afraid of the rain.

608
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:25,607
I'm not afraid of the rain.

609
00:56:25,773 --> 00:56:28,606
Dear God, I wish I weren't.

610
00:56:44,253 --> 00:56:46,403
- Did you see the two new patients?
- No.

611
00:56:46,573 --> 00:56:48,052
A head wound and a hernia.

612
00:56:48,213 --> 00:56:50,363
- It's interesting.
- I'm grateful for them.

613
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:53,411
- I was terrified they'd send me back.
- How's your hero?

614
00:56:53,573 --> 00:56:55,723
He walked down the corridor
three times...

615
00:56:55,893 --> 00:56:59,966
...then he wanted to try running.
I had to stop him forcibly.

616
00:57:00,133 --> 00:57:02,010
We're going boating next week.

617
00:57:02,173 --> 00:57:05,643
- I think it'll be good for him, don't you?
- Dandy.

618
00:57:05,853 --> 00:57:08,890
I went all over Milan
looking for American oatmeal.

619
00:57:09,053 --> 00:57:10,372
It's really only gruel.

620
00:57:10,533 --> 00:57:13,286
He insists it has to come out
of an American package.

621
00:57:13,453 --> 00:57:15,808
Luckily he's much more
tolerant about bacon.

622
00:57:16,013 --> 00:57:18,925
- They're all alike.
- What do you mean?

623
00:57:19,093 --> 00:57:20,606
I mean they all got habits.

624
00:57:20,773 --> 00:57:23,162
Chief one being,
they don't wanna get married.

625
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:27,121
- He's already proposed.
- Proposed what?

626
00:57:27,813 --> 00:57:29,326
To marry me.

627
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:32,491
Well, well!
I take it all back...

628
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:36,362
...about his being a "love them
and leave them" boy. Congratulations.

629
00:57:36,533 --> 00:57:39,605
Thank you, but getting married
would only mean separation.

630
00:57:39,773 --> 00:57:42,606
- You know the regulations.
- Are you crazy?

631
00:57:42,813 --> 00:57:44,212
No, don't answer. Listen:

632
00:57:44,373 --> 00:57:47,524
In a couple months your Frederico
walks out on good legs...

633
00:57:47,693 --> 00:57:50,253
...and leaves you behind.
- It won't be like that.

634
00:57:50,413 --> 00:57:52,404
Listen, honey,
that's also regulations.

635
00:57:52,573 --> 00:57:56,088
Every soldier feels the right
to walk out on any dame he captures...

636
00:57:56,253 --> 00:57:59,529
...while serving his country.
- Stop, before you make me angry.

637
00:57:59,733 --> 00:58:02,406
Get angry. It may pump
some sense into your head.

638
00:58:04,173 --> 00:58:06,926
What is the noise about,
Miss Barkley?

639
00:58:07,093 --> 00:58:11,405
Well, I was just saying that
the only thing that can help the Allies...

640
00:58:11,573 --> 00:58:15,248
...is for the Americans to come over here
and come over quick.

641
00:58:15,413 --> 00:58:18,291
Our English lady doesn't
approve of that statement.

642
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:22,412
I will not tolerate a disturbance
in this hospital of any kind.

643
00:58:22,613 --> 00:58:25,002
Yes, Miss Van Campen.

644
00:58:28,013 --> 00:58:30,402
If you don't like Americans,
Miss Barkley...

645
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:34,361
...you will please keep it to yourself.
- Yes, Miss Van Campen.

646
00:58:36,293 --> 00:58:38,409
- Does Miss Barkley smoke?
- No, I don't.

647
00:58:38,573 --> 00:58:41,610
I mean, no. No, she doesn't.

648
00:58:57,573 --> 00:58:59,689
Hold your nose when you jump.

649
00:59:13,213 --> 00:59:16,444
- How many people have you loved?
- Nobody.

650
00:59:16,613 --> 00:59:19,491
- Except me, of course.
- You're the first and only.

651
00:59:19,693 --> 00:59:21,126
Come.

652
00:59:21,293 --> 00:59:24,012
- How many others, really?
- None.

653
00:59:25,093 --> 00:59:27,653
You're lying to me.

654
00:59:27,813 --> 00:59:29,166
A little.

655
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:32,530
It's all right.
That's what I want you to do.

656
00:59:32,693 --> 00:59:35,605
Keep right on lying to me.

657
00:59:40,133 --> 00:59:42,806
When does a girl say
how much it costs?

658
00:59:43,533 --> 00:59:46,206
- I don't know.
- Of course not.

659
00:59:47,813 --> 00:59:50,122
Does she say she loves him?

660
00:59:50,733 --> 00:59:53,884
Tell me that. I want to know that.

661
00:59:54,053 --> 00:59:57,011
Yes, if he wants her to.

662
00:59:58,173 --> 01:00:00,448
Does he say he loves her?

663
01:00:00,613 --> 01:00:03,081
Tell me, please. It's important.

664
01:00:03,253 --> 01:00:06,484
He does if he wants to.

665
01:00:06,653 --> 01:00:09,213
But you never did.

666
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:12,126
Tell me the truth, please.

667
01:00:12,293 --> 01:00:13,965
No.

668
01:00:14,133 --> 01:00:17,808
You wouldn't.
I knew you wouldn't.

669
01:00:18,413 --> 01:00:20,085
I love you, darling.

670
01:00:26,053 --> 01:00:29,489
The girl just says
what the man wants her to.

671
01:00:30,133 --> 01:00:32,010
Well, not always. But...

672
01:00:32,173 --> 01:00:33,447
But I will.

673
01:00:33,613 --> 01:00:37,367
I'll say just what you wish,
and I'll do what you wish.

674
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:40,331
Then you'll never want
any other girls, will you?

675
01:00:40,493 --> 01:00:41,767
Never.

676
01:00:41,933 --> 01:00:45,448
I'll do and say what you want.
Then I'll be a great success.

677
01:00:45,613 --> 01:00:48,081
- Won't I?
- You're lovely and wonderful.

678
01:00:48,253 --> 01:00:50,483
There isn't any me anymore.

679
01:00:50,653 --> 01:00:52,689
Just what you want.

680
01:00:52,853 --> 01:00:55,083
- Ask for it.
- You.

681
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:19,612
Miss Barkley?

682
01:01:19,773 --> 01:01:22,003
Where's Miss Barkley?

683
01:01:22,173 --> 01:01:25,131
Have you seen Miss Barkley?
I've been looking everywhere.

684
01:01:25,853 --> 01:01:29,528
- I'll... I'll tell her you want to see her.
- Where is she?

685
01:01:29,693 --> 01:01:31,729
In the kitchen, I'm sure.

686
01:01:31,893 --> 01:01:34,043
She always insists
on doing the dishes.

687
01:01:34,213 --> 01:01:37,091
- Works like a truck horse.
- Thank you.

688
01:01:48,733 --> 01:01:50,246
Van Campen's on the warpath.

689
01:01:50,413 --> 01:01:53,849
I detoured her to the kitchen.
You've got about one minute.

690
01:01:54,613 --> 01:01:56,331
Van Campen.

691
01:02:02,933 --> 01:02:04,685
Give me the paper.

692
01:02:09,733 --> 01:02:13,931
"With Babe Ruth in the box, the Red Sox
again clobbered the wilting Senators...

693
01:02:14,093 --> 01:02:15,367
...5- 0.

694
01:02:15,573 --> 01:02:18,963
A dreary session, except for
a triple play in the ninth stanza...

695
01:02:19,133 --> 01:02:23,331
...that led to the groaning exodus from
the sweltering Washington bleachers."

696
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:27,363
Miss Barkley, the bedsteads
in Ward B need polishing.

697
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,364
Yes, ma'am.

698
01:02:30,573 --> 01:02:35,044
I don't understand why you remain
in the room when the patient is asleep.

699
01:02:35,973 --> 01:02:38,692
I didn't know he was asleep.
I was reading to him.

700
01:02:38,853 --> 01:02:42,209
Reading to the patients
is not part of your duties, Miss Barkley.

701
01:02:42,373 --> 01:02:45,888
- I'm very sorry. I thought...
- You may leave the paper here.

702
01:02:46,413 --> 01:02:49,723
He can finish that important
dispatch by himself.

703
01:03:11,456 --> 01:03:13,128
Come on, Black Feet!

704
01:03:13,336 --> 01:03:15,406
Come on, Black Feet.
Make your move!

705
01:03:23,456 --> 01:03:26,653
And I was counting on throwing
a party at the Grand'ltalia.

706
01:03:26,816 --> 01:03:29,728
Let's see if we can pick
a winner in the next race.

707
01:03:31,056 --> 01:03:33,695
- What's the matter, Cathy?
- Nothing, darling.

708
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:36,654
You're not depressed because
we lost the last race?

709
01:03:36,816 --> 01:03:39,614
- Certainly not.
- Then what's wrong?

710
01:03:39,776 --> 01:03:42,336
- Nothing, really.
- Yes, there is.

711
01:03:42,496 --> 01:03:44,452
Tell me, please.

712
01:03:44,616 --> 01:03:46,095
I don't want to.

713
01:03:46,256 --> 01:03:49,054
I'm afraid it would make you
unhappy or worry you.

714
01:03:49,216 --> 01:03:52,253
It won't, if it doesn't worry you.

715
01:03:53,376 --> 01:03:55,094
All right.

716
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:58,293
I'm going to have a baby.

717
01:04:02,416 --> 01:04:04,930
- That is news.
- You're not upset?

718
01:04:05,096 --> 01:04:07,052
Please don't worry.

719
01:04:07,216 --> 01:04:09,969
- I only worry about you.
- Please don't.

720
01:04:10,696 --> 01:04:13,256
Everybody has babies.
It's a natural thing.

721
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:16,852
- You're pretty wonderful.
- No, I'm not.

722
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:21,605
But I won't be any trouble
after this one minute.

723
01:04:21,776 --> 01:04:23,767
I've known for some time.

724
01:04:24,336 --> 01:04:27,885
Haven't I been a good girl till now?
You never suspected.

725
01:04:28,976 --> 01:04:30,568
Well, that settles one thing.

726
01:04:30,736 --> 01:04:33,091
- We'll get married tomorrow.
- No, please.

727
01:04:33,256 --> 01:04:35,451
That's why I didn't tell you before.

728
01:04:36,536 --> 01:04:38,970
I didn't want you to feel trapped.

729
01:04:39,696 --> 01:04:41,288
Tell me you don't feel trapped.

730
01:04:42,496 --> 01:04:45,806
You always feel trapped, biologically.

731
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:49,486
Always isn't a pretty word.

732
01:04:49,656 --> 01:04:52,807
- I'm sorry, Cat.
- It's all right.

733
01:04:53,016 --> 01:04:57,009
You see, I've never had a baby.

734
01:04:57,616 --> 01:05:00,130
I've tried to be the way you want.

735
01:05:00,816 --> 01:05:03,125
And you talk about "always."

736
01:05:03,336 --> 01:05:05,008
Cat, I could cut out my tongue.

737
01:05:05,176 --> 01:05:08,612
Darling, I'm delighted.
Honestly, I am.

738
01:05:09,776 --> 01:05:11,767
I'll dig up a minister, a mayor maybe.

739
01:05:11,936 --> 01:05:13,813
No, no, please.

740
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:16,365
They'd ship me
straight back to England.

741
01:05:18,256 --> 01:05:21,646
Maybe the war will be over
before you have to go back.

742
01:05:21,816 --> 01:05:24,808
The important thing
is for us to be together now.

743
01:05:24,976 --> 01:05:27,444
Just as long as we can.

744
01:05:27,616 --> 01:05:30,574
Attention!

745
01:05:30,776 --> 01:05:34,052
A special communique
from the Isonzo front.

746
01:05:34,576 --> 01:05:37,534
In spite of desperate resistance...

747
01:05:37,696 --> 01:05:40,164
...by the flower
of the Austrian army...

748
01:05:40,376 --> 01:05:46,485
...our troops have reached the summit
of San Gabriele and San Marco.

749
01:05:55,936 --> 01:05:58,734
Isn't that fine wedding music?

750
01:05:59,416 --> 01:06:04,285
I, Catherine, take thee, Frederick,
for my wedded husband.

751
01:06:05,056 --> 01:06:07,286
To have and to hold...

752
01:06:08,056 --> 01:06:10,286
...till death do us part.

753
01:06:13,256 --> 01:06:15,816
Till death do us part.

754
01:06:32,776 --> 01:06:34,414
Nino.

755
01:06:42,016 --> 01:06:45,611
Where did you get these bottles, Nino?
I demand an answer.

756
01:06:45,776 --> 01:06:49,974
- They're Lieutenant Henry's, aren't they?
- Please, they are empty bottles.

757
01:06:50,136 --> 01:06:52,172
I understand.

758
01:07:05,416 --> 01:07:08,965
You won't ever leave me for
anybody else, will you?

759
01:07:10,576 --> 01:07:16,208
I have plenty of faults, but I'm faithful.
I'll be so faithful you'll be sick of me.

760
01:07:17,256 --> 01:07:21,852
Lieutenant, I've suspected you of using
this hospital as a place of diversion.

761
01:07:22,016 --> 01:07:24,484
- Miss Barkley's no diversion...
- Are these yours?

762
01:07:24,696 --> 01:07:27,733
Yes. One's brandy and
the other's kummel. They're empty.

763
01:07:27,896 --> 01:07:29,170
One moment, Miss Barkley.

764
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:32,134
You know our rules.
Therefore you know what to expect.

765
01:07:33,016 --> 01:07:35,974
As for you, you're obviously
no longer a convalescent.

766
01:07:36,176 --> 01:07:39,612
I'm notifying headquarters you are
ready to return to active duty.

767
01:07:40,296 --> 01:07:42,093
This very night.

768
01:07:44,376 --> 01:07:46,048
Tonight...?

769
01:08:07,816 --> 01:08:09,727
It's almost 11.

770
01:08:10,416 --> 01:08:12,611
We still have a few hours.

771
01:08:14,936 --> 01:08:17,689
They'll be skiing in
Saint Moritz soon.

772
01:08:17,856 --> 01:08:20,051
We'll go sometime.

773
01:08:21,416 --> 01:08:23,293
All right.

774
01:08:47,536 --> 01:08:49,606
They're like us.

775
01:08:49,816 --> 01:08:51,852
Nobody's like us.

776
01:08:52,056 --> 01:08:54,775
I wish they had someplace to go.

777
01:08:54,976 --> 01:08:57,615
- It might not do them any good.
- Oh, I don't know.

778
01:08:57,816 --> 01:09:00,933
Everybody ought to have
someplace to go.

779
01:09:02,496 --> 01:09:04,612
I feel better now.

780
01:09:04,816 --> 01:09:06,886
I felt terrible when we started.

781
01:09:07,096 --> 01:09:09,371
We always feel good
when we're together.

782
01:09:09,576 --> 01:09:12,374
- We always will be together.
- Yes.

783
01:09:12,536 --> 01:09:16,688
Except that,
I'm leaving a little after 2.

784
01:09:17,336 --> 01:09:19,725
Don't think about it, darling.

785
01:09:21,736 --> 01:09:24,489
- Do you have to go back for your things?
- No.

786
01:09:24,696 --> 01:09:27,494
The porter's taking my bags
and saving me a place.

787
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:29,334
Good.

788
01:09:30,096 --> 01:09:33,805
After you leave, I'll go back
and get my things.

789
01:09:35,176 --> 01:09:39,727
- How's your leg? Getting tired?
- No.

790
01:09:40,136 --> 01:09:42,696
But let's not walk too long.

791
01:09:43,216 --> 01:09:45,093
Let's go somewhere.

792
01:09:46,096 --> 01:09:47,814
Good.

793
01:09:50,616 --> 01:09:52,607
Let's go in there.

794
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:54,814
All right.

795
01:10:11,296 --> 01:10:13,605
I'd like a room.
A suite, if you have one.

796
01:10:13,816 --> 01:10:16,376
- For how long?
- Catching a train in a few hours.

797
01:10:16,536 --> 01:10:21,371
Oh, yes, I understand. We have
no suites, but we can give you...

798
01:10:22,776 --> 01:10:25,768
...Number 15.
Our mirror room, very popular.

799
01:10:26,816 --> 01:10:28,534
- With private bath.
- Fine.

800
01:10:28,736 --> 01:10:30,374
- No luggage?
- No luggage.

801
01:10:30,576 --> 01:10:33,090
Ten lire in advance, please.

802
01:10:35,656 --> 01:10:40,605
Would you care for some wine?
We have some good French champagne.

803
01:10:40,776 --> 01:10:42,573
All right. Some sandwiches too.

804
01:10:42,736 --> 01:10:44,727
Your key. Arturo!

805
01:10:46,016 --> 01:10:48,530
Shame on you.

806
01:10:48,696 --> 01:10:51,085
Shame.

807
01:11:04,576 --> 01:11:07,488
Just the right atmosphere, isn't it?

808
01:11:09,656 --> 01:11:11,487
What's the matter, darling?

809
01:11:12,336 --> 01:11:14,975
I never felt like a whore before.

810
01:11:15,856 --> 01:11:17,414
You're not a whore.

811
01:11:17,616 --> 01:11:21,131
I know it, darling,
but it isn't nice to feel like one.

812
01:11:24,536 --> 01:11:26,686
Come here, please.

813
01:11:27,696 --> 01:11:30,290
Come here. Please, darling.

814
01:11:31,576 --> 01:11:33,965
I'm a good girl again.

815
01:11:35,136 --> 01:11:36,694
You're my fine girl.

816
01:11:37,816 --> 01:11:40,125
I'm certainly yours.

817
01:11:42,376 --> 01:11:46,608
- And you're a fine, simple girl.
- Yes, I am a simple girl.

818
01:11:46,776 --> 01:11:49,370
But no one ever
understood it except you.

819
01:11:49,536 --> 01:11:53,165
I didn't think so at first.
I thought you were a crazy girl.

820
01:11:53,336 --> 01:11:58,490
I was a little crazy. But I wasn't
crazy in any complicated way.

821
01:11:58,656 --> 01:12:02,046
- I didn't confuse you, did I, darling?
- You did, a little.

822
01:12:02,256 --> 01:12:03,974
Here.

823
01:12:10,096 --> 01:12:14,647
Wine is a grand thing. It makes you
forget all the bad you do.

824
01:12:14,856 --> 01:12:16,687
Then have some more.

825
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,532
Vice is a wonderful thing too.

826
01:12:19,696 --> 01:12:22,369
People who go in for it have
good taste about it.

827
01:12:22,576 --> 01:12:25,693
The red plush is really splendid.
Just the thing.

828
01:12:25,856 --> 01:12:30,168
I don't know how a room like this would
be for waking up with a hangover.

829
01:12:30,376 --> 01:12:33,334
But everything we do seems
so innocent and simple.

830
01:12:36,056 --> 01:12:38,251
Wine is lovely.

831
01:12:38,776 --> 01:12:41,813
But it's given
my father gout very badly.

832
01:12:41,976 --> 01:12:46,527
- Have you a father?
- Yes. He has gout.

833
01:12:46,736 --> 01:12:49,967
You won't ever have to meet him.
Haven't you a father?

834
01:12:51,376 --> 01:12:54,174
- Stepfather.
- Will I like him?

835
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:56,167
You won't ever have to meet him.

836
01:12:56,656 --> 01:13:00,171
But he's very generous. I can
draw drafts on him whenever I please.

837
01:13:00,336 --> 01:13:02,372
That's good.

838
01:13:03,856 --> 01:13:06,973
We have such a fine time together.

839
01:13:07,256 --> 01:13:10,726
I don't take any interest
in anything else anymore.

840
01:13:10,936 --> 01:13:16,010
I feel very married to you,
it makes me so happy.

841
01:13:20,656 --> 01:13:26,128
But at my back I always hear
Time's winged chariot hurrying near

842
01:13:27,256 --> 01:13:29,247
Is it time to go?

843
01:13:36,176 --> 01:13:38,132
Don't worry, darling.

844
01:13:40,096 --> 01:13:42,656
You were fine until now,
and now you're worrying.

845
01:13:42,816 --> 01:13:44,249
I won't.

846
01:13:45,216 --> 01:13:47,127
How often will you write?

847
01:13:47,336 --> 01:13:49,566
Every day.

848
01:13:49,776 --> 01:13:51,812
Do they read your letters?

849
01:13:52,016 --> 01:13:55,247
- I'll make them very confusing.
- But not too confusing.

850
01:13:55,456 --> 01:13:58,368
I'll just make them a little confusing.

851
01:14:01,696 --> 01:14:05,291
- I hate to leave our fine house.
- So do I.

852
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:09,047
We're never settled
in our home very long.

853
01:14:10,936 --> 01:14:13,052
We will be.

854
01:14:13,456 --> 01:14:17,244
I'll have a fine home for you
when you come back.

855
01:14:17,616 --> 01:14:19,766
For young Catherine.

856
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:32,487
- We have to go, darling. Really.
- All right.

857
01:14:32,976 --> 01:14:35,012
You go first.

858
01:14:57,656 --> 01:15:00,329
I'm sick with worry about you.

859
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,771
Where will you go? What will you do?

860
01:15:02,976 --> 01:15:05,285
Please don't
worry about me, darling.

861
01:15:05,496 --> 01:15:09,330
I've plenty of money,
and I'll find some nice place.

862
01:15:09,536 --> 01:15:13,927
Maybe on the lakes.
It ought to be beautiful in the autumn.

863
01:15:14,136 --> 01:15:16,604
Where will you have the baby?

864
01:15:17,176 --> 01:15:22,250
That's a long way off.
You're not to worry about that one bit.

865
01:15:22,816 --> 01:15:26,126
Anyway,
people have babies everywhere.

866
01:15:26,296 --> 01:15:28,651
Yes, that's true.

867
01:15:49,176 --> 01:15:51,212
Well.

868
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:53,691
This is it, kid.

869
01:15:54,896 --> 01:15:58,730
- I'm going into the station with you.
- No, darling, I'd rather you didn't.

870
01:15:59,216 --> 01:16:03,926
- Oh, darling, please.
- It'll be easier to say goodbye here.

871
01:16:08,616 --> 01:16:10,208
Thank you.

872
01:16:10,416 --> 01:16:13,488
- Thank you for everything.
- I love you.

873
01:16:13,656 --> 01:16:17,490
I love you. I adore you.

874
01:16:17,776 --> 01:16:20,244
Take good care of yourself
and young Catherine.

875
01:16:20,456 --> 01:16:23,254
I will. And you...

876
01:16:23,416 --> 01:16:25,691
...you promise
you'll come back to us.

877
01:16:25,896 --> 01:16:27,773
I will.

878
01:16:39,936 --> 01:16:43,087
Take the lady back
to the American hospital.

879
01:18:30,536 --> 01:18:34,449
- Hello. How are you?
- All right, sir, thank you. And you?

880
01:18:36,096 --> 01:18:38,815
You couldn't believe
how bad it's been.

881
01:18:39,456 --> 01:18:41,094
But it will be worse.

882
01:18:41,656 --> 01:18:43,806
We can expect the Germans
on this front...

883
01:18:43,976 --> 01:18:47,173
...now that the Russians have made
a separate peace with them.

884
01:18:48,776 --> 01:18:50,209
What about your countrymen?

885
01:18:50,376 --> 01:18:53,732
Now that your country's in it,
will there be many Americans here?

886
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:56,456
They're training an army of 10 million.

887
01:18:57,616 --> 01:19:01,450
The French front will get them all.
We'll never get any down here.

888
01:19:01,616 --> 01:19:04,494
- We'll face the Germans alone.
- Many of them, you think?

889
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:08,968
Five, 10 divisions, who knows.
But I suppose we'll know soon enough.

890
01:19:09,176 --> 01:19:12,452
- Heard the Germans are good.
- It isn't that they're better men.

891
01:19:12,616 --> 01:19:16,734
They've got a better war machine.
Been building it gun by gun for years...

892
01:19:16,936 --> 01:19:20,485
...while we Italians
have been practicing civilization.

893
01:19:20,656 --> 01:19:23,773
Now, of course,
civilization is not very useful.

894
01:19:27,856 --> 01:19:30,086
There's one of your
ambulances left in town.

895
01:19:30,256 --> 01:19:32,486
The others I sent to Caporetto.
You know it?

896
01:19:32,656 --> 01:19:35,773
Yes, sir. A nice little town
with a fountain in the square.

897
01:19:36,656 --> 01:19:39,295
I doubt if the fountain is still there.

898
01:19:39,856 --> 01:19:41,687
Better go see your friend Rinaldi.

899
01:19:42,376 --> 01:19:44,128
Anything wrong?

900
01:19:44,296 --> 01:19:47,891
He's had a summer and fall of it,
I can tell you.

901
01:19:50,136 --> 01:19:51,933
Thank you, sir.

902
01:19:59,896 --> 01:20:02,649
- Father Galli.
- Frederick, how are you?

903
01:20:02,816 --> 01:20:04,932
- I am glad to see you.
- Hello, Father.

904
01:20:05,096 --> 01:20:07,007
- Your wounds are healed?
- All healed.

905
01:20:07,176 --> 01:20:11,169
- You have come back at a bad time.
- Sounds a little noisy.

906
01:20:11,376 --> 01:20:15,164
- Hello, baby.
- Rini. How are you?

907
01:20:15,336 --> 01:20:17,804
- How's the leg?
- Working.

908
01:20:17,976 --> 01:20:20,206
Sit down. Let me look at it.

909
01:20:20,416 --> 01:20:22,646
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, major.

910
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:38,330
Eighty percent mobility.
It's a crime to send you back.

911
01:20:38,536 --> 01:20:41,050
Now, tell me
about everything, papi.

912
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,605
Nothing much to tell. How are you?

913
01:20:43,816 --> 01:20:50,130
How am I? I dig bullets out of blood.
I cut off arms, legs, the side of a face.

914
01:20:50,336 --> 01:20:53,248
I am becoming a remarkable surgeon.

915
01:20:53,856 --> 01:20:57,974
We will celebrate my genius.
We'll get drunk, papi.

916
01:20:58,136 --> 01:21:00,206
- No, I'm tired, Rini.
- We'll get drunk.

917
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:04,489
And go meet some girls with
loud voices, and then we'll feel fine.

918
01:21:04,656 --> 01:21:08,092
Seven stars.
War booty from San Gabriele.

919
01:21:08,336 --> 01:21:11,089
- Cognac, Father?
- No, thanks.

920
01:21:12,136 --> 01:21:16,254
Saint Paul said, "Take a little wine
for your stomach's sake."

921
01:21:16,416 --> 01:21:19,214
- Yes, I know.
- Father Galli knows.

922
01:21:19,376 --> 01:21:23,335
Father Galli is better than Saint Paul.
Saint Paul was a rounder, a chaser.

923
01:21:23,496 --> 01:21:27,853
- It's the truth, Frederico?
- I never discuss a saint after dark.

924
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:34,012
So you've gone over to the priests.
I have to bait this priest alone.

925
01:21:34,176 --> 01:21:37,168
The priests always win.
Everyone ends up on their knees.

926
01:21:37,336 --> 01:21:40,373
Except the miserable Rinaldi.
He remains true to the devil.

927
01:21:40,536 --> 01:21:43,767
No, Rinaldi, you're all right.

928
01:21:44,496 --> 01:21:46,248
To all of us.

929
01:21:56,136 --> 01:22:00,334
You are changed. You drink differently.
Are you married?

930
01:22:00,536 --> 01:22:02,333
- Not yet.
- Still in love?

931
01:22:02,496 --> 01:22:04,248
- Yes.
- Same girl?

932
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,725
- Yes.
- Is she good to you?

933
01:22:06,896 --> 01:22:08,454
Shut up.

934
01:22:08,656 --> 01:22:12,126
All right. To hell with love.

935
01:22:12,336 --> 01:22:14,611
He's been under a strain.

936
01:22:14,816 --> 01:22:18,092
The Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse.

937
01:22:18,656 --> 01:22:22,365
It destroys the liver and
makes the hand shake.

938
01:22:22,576 --> 01:22:27,206
A surgeon's hand shaking inside
a man's belly. Very fine.

939
01:22:29,296 --> 01:22:32,766
- I drink to open bellies.
- You ought to have a leave.

940
01:22:34,896 --> 01:22:37,569
He wants to get rid of me
because I have a disease.

941
01:22:39,656 --> 01:22:43,092
- Is that true, Father?
- No. It's in his mind. His mind is sick.

942
01:22:43,256 --> 01:22:45,008
It's true.

943
01:22:47,376 --> 01:22:49,332
It's true.

944
01:22:50,616 --> 01:22:52,891
Everybody has it.

945
01:22:53,096 --> 01:22:54,973
The whole world...

946
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:56,933
...has it.

947
01:22:57,536 --> 01:23:02,405
He's been working too hard, day and
night. There are not enough doctors.

948
01:23:03,616 --> 01:23:06,653
Tell me about Miss Barkley, papi.

949
01:23:08,696 --> 01:23:11,654
I want to hear something pretty.

950
01:23:14,936 --> 01:23:17,325
Tell me something pretty.

951
01:23:20,216 --> 01:23:23,367
I'll speak to the general
about a leave for him.

952
01:23:23,736 --> 01:23:27,172
- Good night, Frederico.
- Good night, Father.

953
01:23:45,856 --> 01:23:48,290
Thank you, papi.

954
01:24:08,816 --> 01:24:13,571
Turn around. Back to Orsino. Come on.

955
01:24:14,336 --> 01:24:17,851
Turn around. Go back. Clear the road.

956
01:24:18,056 --> 01:24:20,092
Come on, hurry up.
Clear the road.

957
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,775
- Sorry, lieutenant. Turn and go back.
- What for, sir?

958
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:26,734
Orders. We must clear
the road to Orsino, and fast.

959
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:28,767
- Right.
- Let's go.

960
01:24:29,616 --> 01:24:31,493
I don't understand.

961
01:24:31,696 --> 01:24:34,733
I don't either,
but I can make a pretty good guess.

962
01:26:06,936 --> 01:26:09,291
Lieutenant! Orders from the division.

963
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:12,050
- Take your ambulance to the retreat line.
- Do I take any wounded?

964
01:26:12,216 --> 01:26:14,855
- Where did you get that information?
- The division.

965
01:26:15,016 --> 01:26:18,895
It's a lie. There is no retreat.
The division has orders to hold the line!

966
01:26:19,056 --> 01:26:23,447
I'll go where I'm told, but please
get your orders straight.

967
01:26:25,376 --> 01:26:29,654
Caporetto is lost. Fifteen German
divisions have broken through.

968
01:26:29,816 --> 01:26:32,933
- All three of our armies are in retreat.
- I'm not surprised.

969
01:26:33,096 --> 01:26:35,656
We are evacuating.
Doctors will go with the army.

970
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:39,092
- What about the wounded?
- It's better not to move them.

971
01:26:39,296 --> 01:26:44,370
- The ambulances will carry equipment.
- I am not equipment.

972
01:26:45,616 --> 01:26:47,607
I am a man. I'm staying.

973
01:26:47,776 --> 01:26:52,167
I repeat division orders:
Every doctor is to go with the army.

974
01:26:53,256 --> 01:26:55,008
Yes, sir.

975
01:26:56,976 --> 01:26:59,536
Orders are a noble thing.

976
01:26:59,736 --> 01:27:02,091
I must not disappoint the division.

977
01:27:02,256 --> 01:27:04,975
- Better to disappoint...
- Come on, Rini, you're sick.

978
01:27:05,136 --> 01:27:09,812
The wounded and the dying. They should
be abandoned without hesitation.

979
01:27:09,976 --> 01:27:13,093
Excuse me, Father. The Germans
will be along in a few hours.

980
01:27:13,256 --> 01:27:16,487
- Come with us in the ambulance.
- I remain here.

981
01:27:16,696 --> 01:27:19,415
They'll pulverize the town
before they come in.

982
01:27:20,096 --> 01:27:22,212
The dying need me.

983
01:27:23,056 --> 01:27:27,015
What about the Abruzzi,
and the chestnut woods and the river?

984
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:31,136
Perhaps, if God permits.

985
01:27:35,816 --> 01:27:37,966
You're someone
to remember, Father.

986
01:27:43,536 --> 01:27:45,891
I am ordered to leave, Father Galli.

987
01:27:46,096 --> 01:27:49,327
But you have better orders,
from God, to remain.

988
01:27:53,576 --> 01:27:56,374
I salute your commanding officer.

989
01:27:56,576 --> 01:27:59,136
May his blessing go with you.

990
01:28:01,736 --> 01:28:03,454
Goodbye, Father.

991
01:28:58,136 --> 01:29:00,092
A scene to remember.

992
01:29:08,736 --> 01:29:10,089
Yes.

993
01:29:10,296 --> 01:29:13,015
Make way for Rinaldi,
who is saving his skin.

994
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:16,049
Shut up, Rini. You're full of fever.

995
01:29:46,136 --> 01:29:47,933
Get off!

996
01:30:55,216 --> 01:30:56,569
Look.

997
01:30:56,776 --> 01:30:59,529
Look, the German spy
is spitting on us.

998
01:30:59,736 --> 01:31:04,127
The dead man spits on us.
That's what we deserve.

999
01:31:18,616 --> 01:31:19,935
It's hopeless.

1000
01:31:20,656 --> 01:31:22,965
Bad luck, Rini. We're walking.

1001
01:31:23,176 --> 01:31:25,565
- Where's Bonello?
- I don't know. I was asleep.

1002
01:31:25,736 --> 01:31:27,374
Just deserted, huh?

1003
01:31:27,576 --> 01:31:29,726
- You stay close to us.
- Yes, lieutenant.

1004
01:31:29,936 --> 01:31:33,212
- Come, Rini, it's gonna be a long haul.
- Father Galli stayed.

1005
01:31:33,376 --> 01:31:36,209
The priest stayed, but Rinaldi runs.

1006
01:31:36,416 --> 01:31:38,054
Come on. No nonsense.

1007
01:31:47,376 --> 01:31:51,449
- Esmeralda!
- Aymo!

1008
01:32:01,616 --> 01:32:05,404
My only loves are untrue to me.

1009
01:32:53,776 --> 01:32:56,006
What's the use?

1010
01:32:56,736 --> 01:32:58,454
- What's the use?
- Stop, Rini.

1011
01:32:58,656 --> 01:33:01,011
What good are we to Italy?

1012
01:33:01,216 --> 01:33:03,286
- We are fit only for surrender.
- Shut up!

1013
01:33:03,456 --> 01:33:07,574
Let the Germans collect
the garbage with a shovel!

1014
01:33:07,736 --> 01:33:09,966
- You're under arrest.
- What are you talking about?

1015
01:33:10,136 --> 01:33:12,650
- You can't touch an officer.
- Shoot him if he resists.

1016
01:33:12,816 --> 01:33:15,046
- What is this? Who are you?
- Battle police.

1017
01:33:15,216 --> 01:33:17,650
- Why arrest Major Rinaldi?
- We heard him.

1018
01:33:17,856 --> 01:33:21,212
- A German infiltrator preaching defeat.
- He's just the opposite!

1019
01:33:21,376 --> 01:33:23,128
Take him away!

1020
01:33:33,016 --> 01:33:34,927
- What's your division?
- Nineteenth.

1021
01:33:35,096 --> 01:33:37,849
The 19th division was pulled out
10 days ago.

1022
01:33:38,016 --> 01:33:40,576
- You're a German in Italian uniform.
- He's a spy.

1023
01:33:40,776 --> 01:33:44,485
Guilty of preaching surrender.
I request he be sentenced to death.

1024
01:33:44,656 --> 01:33:47,568
I place the accused in the hands
of the court-martial.

1025
01:33:51,776 --> 01:33:55,007
In the name of His Majesty,
the court finds the prisoner guilty...

1026
01:33:55,176 --> 01:33:56,768
...and orders him shot.
- Wait.

1027
01:33:56,936 --> 01:34:00,292
Wait. I will talk. I will talk, wait!

1028
01:34:02,376 --> 01:34:07,166
Keep your hands off me.
I need no assistance.

1029
01:34:14,056 --> 01:34:16,172
Your name, rank and birthplace.

1030
01:34:17,296 --> 01:34:19,526
My name is Alessandro Rinaldi.

1031
01:34:19,696 --> 01:34:22,256
My rank is that of a coward.

1032
01:34:22,456 --> 01:34:25,607
My birthplace I will not
disgrace by naming it.

1033
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:28,772
You have medical corps insignia.

1034
01:34:28,936 --> 01:34:31,814
Forgive me. I forgot to tear it off.

1035
01:34:32,016 --> 01:34:34,007
No, Rini, stop it.
Tell them the truth!

1036
01:34:34,176 --> 01:34:37,213
He was spreading disorder.
He called our army "garbage."

1037
01:34:37,376 --> 01:34:39,685
- He was telling our men to surrender.
- I ran.

1038
01:34:39,976 --> 01:34:41,728
I ran with them.

1039
01:34:41,896 --> 01:34:46,174
I am a doctor needed by
our dying men. And I ran.

1040
01:34:46,336 --> 01:34:50,170
Dispose of me, garbage inspector!

1041
01:34:50,376 --> 01:34:52,128
- Let me talk for him.
- Silence.

1042
01:34:52,336 --> 01:34:56,329
Come, you heroes.
Shoot the coward, and win the war.

1043
01:34:57,696 --> 01:35:01,609
You are a German infiltrator
or a confessed deserter.

1044
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:13,851
In the name of His Majesty,
you're ordered to be shot.

1045
01:35:23,056 --> 01:35:26,810
You're mad. Major Rinaldi's sick.
He's sick, I tell you.

1046
01:35:30,896 --> 01:35:32,852
Colonel.

1047
01:35:34,056 --> 01:35:38,208
You must listen to me. He's one of
the best surgeons in your army.

1048
01:35:39,096 --> 01:35:40,370
Our army?

1049
01:35:45,696 --> 01:35:47,652
Give your name, rank and birthplace.

1050
01:35:49,256 --> 01:35:53,215
Goodbye, papi.
I am joining Father Galli.

1051
01:35:54,976 --> 01:35:56,489
No...

1052
01:35:58,616 --> 01:36:00,572
Answer the question.

1053
01:36:01,576 --> 01:36:02,895
You are not an Italian.

1054
01:36:03,096 --> 01:36:07,408
You're wearing an Italian uniform, but
you do not even know the Italian salute.

1055
01:38:17,296 --> 01:38:20,845
Ferguson! Ferguson?

1056
01:38:33,536 --> 01:38:34,889
Ferguson.

1057
01:38:35,056 --> 01:38:37,889
- Fred, what are you doing here?
- Don't ask questions.

1058
01:38:38,056 --> 01:38:40,206
- Look at you.
- Where's Catherine?

1059
01:38:40,496 --> 01:38:41,611
- Are you wounded?
- No.

1060
01:38:41,776 --> 01:38:44,244
- I hope it's a hole in your head.
- Where is she?

1061
01:38:44,416 --> 01:38:45,929
In the mess you got her into.

1062
01:38:46,096 --> 01:38:49,975
I can't stand here arguing with you.
Please, before they grab me.

1063
01:38:50,936 --> 01:38:54,611
Please, Ferguson, where is she?

1064
01:38:55,376 --> 01:38:59,164
Stresa. Hotel Valeria, room seven.

1065
01:38:59,376 --> 01:39:00,855
Lieutenant Henry.

1066
01:39:01,016 --> 01:39:03,849
Are you wounded? What are you
doing in those clothes?

1067
01:39:04,016 --> 01:39:05,813
Before you do anything, let me...

1068
01:39:05,976 --> 01:39:08,365
Don't tell me anything.
You're a deserter!

1069
01:39:08,536 --> 01:39:12,085
- Not the way you think. I had to...
- Of course. Cowards always run.

1070
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:14,850
Will you give up,
or shall I do it for you?

1071
01:39:15,856 --> 01:39:17,209
No firing squad for me.

1072
01:40:06,976 --> 01:40:08,295
Darling...

1073
01:40:11,616 --> 01:40:13,732
Oh, darling.

1074
01:40:21,856 --> 01:40:24,006
What's wrong?

1075
01:40:27,256 --> 01:40:29,565
I'll tell you about it.

1076
01:40:32,576 --> 01:40:36,091
Darling, you're ill. I'll get a doctor.

1077
01:40:36,296 --> 01:40:41,165
I don't need a doctor. I'm not sick.
Not that way.

1078
01:40:41,536 --> 01:40:44,972
Then what is it? I don't understand.

1079
01:40:45,216 --> 01:40:46,569
It's just...

1080
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:50,935
...I'm through.
I'm through with the war.

1081
01:40:51,576 --> 01:40:54,249
I've made a separate peace.

1082
01:40:55,576 --> 01:40:57,407
You mean, you...

1083
01:40:57,576 --> 01:40:59,407
You deserted?

1084
01:40:59,576 --> 01:41:03,774
Yes. I'm a deserter.

1085
01:41:05,536 --> 01:41:09,927
It's not your army, or your country.

1086
01:41:12,216 --> 01:41:14,525
Tell me what happened.

1087
01:41:16,376 --> 01:41:18,731
All kinds of hell.

1088
01:41:20,376 --> 01:41:25,575
Rinaldi's dead. They killed him.
A firing squad.

1089
01:41:25,976 --> 01:41:28,444
I'd better not tell you about it.

1090
01:41:29,096 --> 01:41:30,768
No, I want to hear.

1091
01:41:31,256 --> 01:41:34,373
He was sick. Talking like a madman.

1092
01:41:34,536 --> 01:41:38,165
And the firing squad blew his brains out.

1093
01:41:38,336 --> 01:41:42,409
I was next. You can't win an
argument with a firing squad.

1094
01:41:42,616 --> 01:41:45,574
No, of course you can't.

1095
01:41:45,736 --> 01:41:51,174
And you're not going to try.
You're not going back.

1096
01:41:51,336 --> 01:41:55,773
I'm not against them.
They're the good ones. The brave ones.

1097
01:41:55,936 --> 01:41:59,372
I wish them all the luck.
They deserve it.

1098
01:41:59,536 --> 01:42:02,209
But it's not my show anymore.

1099
01:42:02,376 --> 01:42:05,015
Of course it isn't.

1100
01:42:05,176 --> 01:42:08,134
We're together, that's all that matters.

1101
01:42:08,296 --> 01:42:12,653
The rest is something else.
Far away.

1102
01:42:12,816 --> 01:42:16,013
Just us. Us.

1103
01:42:47,856 --> 01:42:50,211
I must say, you look better.

1104
01:42:50,816 --> 01:42:53,205
I think I'll be hungry for a week.

1105
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:56,652
I thought you were going
to sleep for a week.

1106
01:42:57,216 --> 01:43:00,526
The sleeves are a bit short.
But it was the best I could do.

1107
01:43:00,696 --> 01:43:03,256
You are a little tall for your age, darling.

1108
01:43:03,416 --> 01:43:04,815
It's a fine outfit.

1109
01:43:04,976 --> 01:43:07,046
We'll just stay right here.

1110
01:43:07,256 --> 01:43:10,931
It's practically deserted this
time of the year. And cheap.

1111
01:43:11,096 --> 01:43:13,246
- Couldn't be nicer.
- Now, let's see...

1112
01:43:13,416 --> 01:43:15,008
...shall I get you some papers?

1113
01:43:15,936 --> 01:43:19,212
No, I don't wanna read the papers.

1114
01:43:19,376 --> 01:43:24,734
I'm sorry. Was it so bad you don't
want even to read about it, darling?

1115
01:43:25,336 --> 01:43:27,645
Yes, it was bad.

1116
01:43:27,816 --> 01:43:30,933
I wish I had been with you
so I would know about it too.

1117
01:43:35,576 --> 01:43:39,694
Darling, what will happen
if they find you?

1118
01:43:41,096 --> 01:43:43,929
- I'll shoot them.
- You wouldn't.

1119
01:43:44,096 --> 01:43:45,848
And what would they do to you?

1120
01:43:46,016 --> 01:43:47,893
They'd shoot me, of course.

1121
01:43:48,056 --> 01:43:50,616
Then we can't stay here.

1122
01:43:53,536 --> 01:43:55,333
We can go to Switzerland.

1123
01:43:55,496 --> 01:43:59,284
- Please, I'm tired of thinking about it.
- The border's very near here.

1124
01:43:59,456 --> 01:44:02,732
Yes, and they have guards across it
like a picket fence.

1125
01:44:04,616 --> 01:44:08,814
We can go across the lake.
We'll borrow one of those boats.

1126
01:44:09,776 --> 01:44:12,609
They'd turn us in if we even asked.

1127
01:44:12,896 --> 01:44:15,854
Then we'll steal one.
We can send it back.

1128
01:44:16,016 --> 01:44:17,574
It's over 20 miles.

1129
01:44:17,776 --> 01:44:19,653
You can do it. I know you can.

1130
01:44:19,816 --> 01:44:21,966
And the patrol boats?
They'd spot us sure.

1131
01:44:22,136 --> 01:44:24,809
Not if we go at night.
Darling, don't you see?

1132
01:44:24,976 --> 01:44:28,651
We've got to get out of here, fast.
Tonight!

1133
01:44:29,136 --> 01:44:30,728
Please.

1134
01:44:34,976 --> 01:44:36,568
All right.

1135
01:44:37,256 --> 01:44:39,053
You're a grand girl.

1136
01:44:47,376 --> 01:44:49,446
I hope nobody saw us.

1137
01:44:49,776 --> 01:44:52,495
I'm more worried about the patrol boats.

1138
01:45:46,856 --> 01:45:49,131
Darling, not so fast. You'll get tired.

1139
01:45:49,296 --> 01:45:52,686
We have to get into Swiss waters
before it's daylight.

1140
01:46:29,656 --> 01:46:31,931
Here, I can do that.

1141
01:46:32,296 --> 01:46:36,084
It's no good. I can't put you
through this. I'm taking you back.

1142
01:46:36,256 --> 01:46:39,612
- You will not.
- I will. This is crazy, you and the baby.

1143
01:46:40,016 --> 01:46:42,405
If you take me ashore,
I'll swim after you.

1144
01:46:42,696 --> 01:46:45,574
A little rain won't hurt me or the baby.

1145
01:46:45,736 --> 01:46:48,534
What will hurt is waiting in that room,
not knowing...

1146
01:46:48,696 --> 01:46:51,415
...if they caught you
and stood you against the wall.

1147
01:46:51,616 --> 01:46:53,208
Now, start rowing!

1148
01:46:56,376 --> 01:46:58,606
All right. You win.

1149
01:46:59,976 --> 01:47:01,329
That's a good boy!

1150
01:47:04,736 --> 01:47:06,010
I could use a drink.

1151
01:47:11,136 --> 01:47:15,254
- Thanks.
- You're ever so welcome.

1152
01:47:18,896 --> 01:47:20,887
- Do you know something?
- What?

1153
01:47:21,056 --> 01:47:25,015
- I don't think this rain is going to last.
- I hope not.

1154
01:47:25,176 --> 01:47:26,928
- Do you know something else?
- What?

1155
01:47:27,096 --> 01:47:29,451
I don't care if it does!

1156
01:47:55,936 --> 01:47:57,449
Aren't you dead?

1157
01:47:57,616 --> 01:48:01,848
Oh, I'm all right.
My hands are sore, is all.

1158
01:48:04,096 --> 01:48:05,734
I think I hear something.

1159
01:48:10,976 --> 01:48:13,251
It's a patrol boat.

1160
01:48:42,256 --> 01:48:43,894
They're backing up.

1161
01:49:11,576 --> 01:49:13,168
They're turning.

1162
01:49:13,656 --> 01:49:15,965
We must be close to the border.

1163
01:49:17,616 --> 01:49:20,926
- Darling, I was terrified.
- So was I.

1164
01:49:22,616 --> 01:49:24,049
Are you all right?

1165
01:49:24,216 --> 01:49:28,175
Darling, I've never been more
all right in my whole life.

1166
01:50:16,776 --> 01:50:20,246
- Darling.
- We're in Switzerland.

1167
01:50:29,096 --> 01:50:33,328
Darling. It's a lovely country.

1168
01:50:33,496 --> 01:50:37,250
Yes. It feels good beneath my feet.

1169
01:50:55,936 --> 01:50:58,609
Can you realize we're
actually in Switzerland?

1170
01:50:58,776 --> 01:51:00,607
Darling, it's true, isn't it?

1171
01:51:01,016 --> 01:51:04,372
I don't have to go down to the station
with you to see you off.

1172
01:51:05,016 --> 01:51:06,574
I hope not.

1173
01:51:07,736 --> 01:51:11,012
Don't say that. It frightens me.

1174
01:51:12,816 --> 01:51:15,455
Your hands, your poor hands.

1175
01:51:15,616 --> 01:51:18,176
We'll buy some ointment.
Magic Swiss ointment.

1176
01:51:18,336 --> 01:51:21,134
- Forget about my hands. I'm still hungry.
- So are we.

1177
01:51:21,296 --> 01:51:23,685
Pardon me.
I'm Lieutenant Zimmerman.

1178
01:51:24,016 --> 01:51:26,371
- Is that your boat that just came in?
- Yes.

1179
01:51:26,536 --> 01:51:27,969
What nationality are you?

1180
01:51:28,136 --> 01:51:29,728
American, British.

1181
01:51:29,896 --> 01:51:32,410
Well, let me see your passports.

1182
01:51:36,976 --> 01:51:38,773
Why do you come to Switzerland?

1183
01:51:38,936 --> 01:51:42,975
We're tourists. My cousin and I
want to enjoy the winter sports.

1184
01:51:43,136 --> 01:51:44,728
You rowed here from Italy?

1185
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:48,172
Rowing is my favorite sport.
I always row when I get a chance.

1186
01:51:48,336 --> 01:51:53,091
- Indeed. Your cousin too?
- Yes, I love it.

1187
01:51:53,616 --> 01:51:55,368
Cousins with the same tastes...

1188
01:51:55,536 --> 01:51:57,333
...of different nationalities...

1189
01:51:57,496 --> 01:51:59,805
...rowing all night across the lake...

1190
01:51:59,976 --> 01:52:01,967
Very interesting.

1191
01:52:03,056 --> 01:52:05,286
What have you been doing in Italy?

1192
01:52:05,456 --> 01:52:09,369
I've been doing some writing.
Picking up local color, you might say.

1193
01:52:09,696 --> 01:52:12,210
And you, Miss... Barkley?

1194
01:52:12,376 --> 01:52:14,014
She's been studying art.

1195
01:52:14,176 --> 01:52:19,330
Yes. Rubens, Raphael, Rembrandt...
You know, things like that.

1196
01:52:19,496 --> 01:52:22,647
- How much money have you?
- Twenty-five hundred lire.

1197
01:52:22,936 --> 01:52:24,255
Twenty-five hundred...?

1198
01:52:24,456 --> 01:52:28,654
As you're so interested in boating,
I can recommend an excellent place.

1199
01:52:28,816 --> 01:52:30,932
A very small, intimate hotel...

1200
01:52:31,096 --> 01:52:35,009
...overlooking the most romantic lake.
- That sounds enchanting.

1201
01:52:35,176 --> 01:52:38,327
It's owned by my mother.
Her name is Madame Zimmerman.

1202
01:52:38,496 --> 01:52:43,570
- How nice.
- I have one of my mother's cards here.

1203
01:52:46,016 --> 01:52:48,655
Take the luggage,
and get these tourists a cab.

1204
01:52:48,816 --> 01:52:51,649
Your passports will be kept
by the police.

1205
01:52:51,816 --> 01:52:54,853
I regret this, but it's necessary
under the circumstances.

1206
01:52:55,416 --> 01:52:59,170
- They'll be returned, after a time.
- But you're sure we can stay?

1207
01:52:59,376 --> 01:53:04,370
I'm certain you and your cousin will find
my mother's hotel very comfortable.

1208
01:53:05,936 --> 01:53:07,654
Thank you, lieutenant.

1209
01:53:15,136 --> 01:53:17,047
It's a great country.

1210
01:53:17,376 --> 01:53:18,775
And so practical.

1211
01:53:42,016 --> 01:53:43,972
You may come in now, Mr. Henry.

1212
01:53:44,376 --> 01:53:47,527
Your wife is an excellent
advertisement for Switzerland.

1213
01:53:47,696 --> 01:53:50,335
She's had only six weeks
of our fine air...

1214
01:53:50,496 --> 01:53:53,454
...but she couldn't be healthier
if she were born Swiss.

1215
01:53:53,696 --> 01:53:57,325
Not one wrong symptom.
A beautiful expectant mother.

1216
01:53:57,536 --> 01:53:59,413
- You should be very pleased.
- I am.

1217
01:53:59,576 --> 01:54:02,693
I prescribe a little sleep
and, of course, some exercise.

1218
01:54:02,896 --> 01:54:04,568
No scaling Alpine peaks.

1219
01:54:04,776 --> 01:54:07,688
Your husband's knee is fine now,
but he must be careful.

1220
01:54:07,856 --> 01:54:10,165
We want the child
to have a healthy father.

1221
01:54:10,336 --> 01:54:12,133
We want him able to walk the baby.

1222
01:54:12,336 --> 01:54:13,610
Well, he will be.

1223
01:54:13,776 --> 01:54:16,734
You'll have the baby in spring,
the season for beginning.

1224
01:54:16,896 --> 01:54:19,171
Thank you, doctor.
We'll see you regularly?

1225
01:54:19,336 --> 01:54:21,213
Of course, but do not be concerned.

1226
01:54:21,416 --> 01:54:23,850
We have babies quite often
in Switzerland.

1227
01:54:24,016 --> 01:54:27,770
- Goodbye, Mrs. Henry.
- Goodbye, doctor, and thank you.

1228
01:54:29,416 --> 01:54:32,931
I'm so excited to be healthy!

1229
01:54:33,096 --> 01:54:36,611
Darling, stop fussing
with that silly pipe...

1230
01:54:37,096 --> 01:54:38,654
What's that?

1231
01:54:39,016 --> 01:54:41,735
Little Catherine.
She's turning a cartwheel.

1232
01:54:41,896 --> 01:54:43,807
Want to feel her?

1233
01:54:47,336 --> 01:54:51,454
- Doesn't it hurt?
- No, you idiot. It feels wonderful.

1234
01:54:51,656 --> 01:54:56,446
I got our passports back from the
police. Now we can get married.

1235
01:54:56,656 --> 01:54:57,930
No.

1236
01:54:58,096 --> 01:55:00,849
I'm sure it would be
the proper thing to do.

1237
01:55:01,016 --> 01:55:02,335
Unless you're crazy.

1238
01:55:02,496 --> 01:55:06,967
Not as crazy as you think. I'm not
going to let you off the hook, ever.

1239
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:11,129
I won't startle the whole countryside
now, letting them know I'm not married.

1240
01:55:11,296 --> 01:55:13,252
We could go to some other village.

1241
01:55:13,416 --> 01:55:17,773
Wherever we went, it would be too
embarrassing. I show too plainly.

1242
01:55:17,936 --> 01:55:21,565
I can't be married
in this splendid matronly shape.

1243
01:55:21,736 --> 01:55:25,172
You'd make a beautiful bride
in any shape.

1244
01:55:25,776 --> 01:55:28,290
We'll get married as soon as
I'm thin again.

1245
01:55:28,456 --> 01:55:32,415
Everyone will say,
"What a handsome couple."

1246
01:55:32,576 --> 01:55:39,175
We'll have orange blossoms, organ
music, and somebody to mind the baby.

1247
01:55:39,736 --> 01:55:41,454
Come in.

1248
01:55:42,776 --> 01:55:45,370
How nice, Mrs. Zimmerman.

1249
01:55:46,136 --> 01:55:48,047
I got to tell you a joke.

1250
01:55:48,216 --> 01:55:51,094
When my son told me you were
coming, he made a mistake.

1251
01:55:51,256 --> 01:55:53,406
He thought you were cousins.

1252
01:56:01,776 --> 01:56:05,485
Here's beer and breakfast
for the gentleman...

1253
01:56:05,656 --> 01:56:09,649
...and hot wine and spices for madam.
- Thank you.

1254
01:56:11,856 --> 01:56:16,008
- Happy evening, lady and gentleman.
- Happy evening, Mrs. Zimmerman.

1255
01:56:17,656 --> 01:56:21,410
- Happy evening, Mrs. Zimmerman.
- I think I may marry Mrs. Zimmerman.

1256
01:56:21,576 --> 01:56:25,489
- She's too good for you.
- Here, drink this while it's hot.

1257
01:56:25,656 --> 01:56:29,365
Darling, I'm going to cut
my hair short. Very short.

1258
01:56:29,536 --> 01:56:32,050
- Now?
- No. When I'm thin again.

1259
01:56:32,216 --> 01:56:34,650
I'll be thin and I'll have short hair.

1260
01:56:34,816 --> 01:56:38,126
- You're not going to say no, are you?
- You can cut it.

1261
01:56:38,296 --> 01:56:41,254
- Why? I thought you liked my hair long.
- I love it long.

1262
01:56:41,416 --> 01:56:43,566
- You said you prefer it short.
- I did not.

1263
01:56:43,776 --> 01:56:46,529
- You hinted it.
- I didn't. I'm just trying to agree.

1264
01:56:46,696 --> 01:56:49,449
I wish you wouldn't try to confuse me.

1265
01:56:49,616 --> 01:56:51,334
I know why you're bored with me.

1266
01:56:51,496 --> 01:56:53,646
- Because I love you too much.
- You're mad.

1267
01:56:53,816 --> 01:56:57,855
- Please don't shout at me.
- I'm just trying to say, you don't bore me.

1268
01:56:58,016 --> 01:57:00,405
Everything else bores me but you.

1269
01:57:00,576 --> 01:57:05,047
Darling, you mustn't mind me.

1270
01:57:05,216 --> 01:57:08,413
We really are the same.
We mustn't misunderstand on purpose.

1271
01:57:08,576 --> 01:57:11,170
- We won't.
- But people do.

1272
01:57:11,496 --> 01:57:14,169
They love each other,
and misunderstand on purpose.

1273
01:57:14,336 --> 01:57:16,850
They fight, then suddenly
they aren't the same.

1274
01:57:17,056 --> 01:57:20,014
- We won't fight.
- We mustn't.

1275
01:57:20,176 --> 01:57:21,894
Because there's only us two.

1276
01:57:22,056 --> 01:57:24,286
In the world,
there's all the rest of them.

1277
01:57:24,456 --> 01:57:27,209
Anything comes between us,
we're gone. They have us.

1278
01:57:27,376 --> 01:57:29,412
They won't get us...

1279
01:57:29,576 --> 01:57:31,214
...because you're too brave.

1280
01:57:34,536 --> 01:57:37,209
Nothing ever happens to the brave.

1281
01:57:37,376 --> 01:57:39,526
They die, of course.

1282
01:57:40,616 --> 01:57:44,894
A coward dies a thousand deaths,
the brave but once.

1283
01:57:45,056 --> 01:57:49,527
The brave die thousands of times,
if they're intelligent.

1284
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:52,768
You're an authority. You're brave.

1285
01:57:52,936 --> 01:57:54,972
No, I'm not.

1286
01:57:55,376 --> 01:57:56,650
But anyway...

1287
01:57:56,816 --> 01:58:00,331
...I won't cut my hair until after
Catherine is born, and I'm thin.

1288
01:58:00,496 --> 01:58:05,889
I'll cut it off and be a fine new girl
for you. And you'll fall in love again.

1289
01:58:06,056 --> 01:58:07,728
I love you enough now.

1290
01:58:07,896 --> 01:58:09,887
What are you
trying to do, ruin me?

1291
01:58:10,056 --> 01:58:14,413
- Yes. I want to ruin you.
- Good, that's what I want too.

1292
01:58:25,216 --> 01:58:29,846
Say, you know how they go courting
in the Alps? They yodel.

1293
01:58:37,456 --> 01:58:40,254
If the lady's interested, she yodels back.

1294
01:58:40,416 --> 01:58:42,168
Really?

1295
01:59:36,496 --> 01:59:38,327
That's it. Checkmate.

1296
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:40,885
I don't care, I've got your queen.

1297
01:59:41,616 --> 01:59:44,176
Darling, the game's over. It's checkmate.

1298
01:59:44,336 --> 01:59:48,124
But why? I still have more of these
silly pieces than you have.

1299
01:59:48,616 --> 01:59:52,325
I wish you liked rummy.
It's much more fun.

1300
01:59:54,696 --> 01:59:57,085
Happy New Year, darling.

1301
01:59:57,976 --> 02:00:00,331
To all three of us.

1302
02:00:07,696 --> 02:00:11,245
- Here's to 1918.
- Little Catherine's year.

1303
02:00:13,976 --> 02:00:17,332
Do you mind? Our being alone, just us,
on New Year's Eve?

1304
02:00:17,496 --> 02:00:19,771
I never feel alone when we're together.

1305
02:00:19,936 --> 02:00:21,892
But sometimes a man
wants to be alone.

1306
02:00:22,056 --> 02:00:25,128
I imagine sometimes a girl
wants to be alone too.

1307
02:00:25,296 --> 02:00:28,129
If they love each other,
they're jealous of that.

1308
02:00:28,296 --> 02:00:31,254
- I don't want to be away from you, ever.
- Me too.

1309
02:00:31,416 --> 02:00:33,805
My life used to be full
of all sorts of things.

1310
02:00:33,976 --> 02:00:37,173
Now, if you're not with me,
I haven't a thing in the world.

1311
02:00:37,576 --> 02:00:41,205
But I'm not fun for you anymore.
I'm just like a big flour barrel.

1312
02:00:41,376 --> 02:00:43,765
You're not. You're more
beautiful all the time.

1313
02:00:43,936 --> 02:00:46,325
Just the same,
you're going to town tomorrow...

1314
02:00:46,496 --> 02:00:48,487
...and find some gay, young playmate.

1315
02:00:48,656 --> 02:00:51,887
- I don't want to be with anybody else.
- Yes, you do.

1316
02:00:52,056 --> 02:00:55,890
I'll start the New Year by buying
Catherine's first wardrobe.

1317
02:00:56,056 --> 02:00:58,729
I'll find what's necessary.
I'll do it tomorrow.

1318
02:00:58,896 --> 02:01:00,454
You should know, you were a nurse.

1319
02:01:00,616 --> 02:01:03,005
But so few soldiers had babies
in the hospital.

1320
02:01:03,176 --> 02:01:04,575
I did.

1321
02:01:09,856 --> 02:01:11,574
Where are you?

1322
02:01:11,976 --> 02:01:13,489
Where are you?

1323
02:01:13,656 --> 02:01:16,966
I'm right here. I've got a sled.

1324
02:01:17,136 --> 02:01:19,855
You sound like a ventriloquist.

1325
02:01:20,776 --> 02:01:24,291
- You look like a spook in fairy land.
- Spook for yourself, darling.

1326
02:01:25,216 --> 02:01:26,569
All aboard.

1327
02:01:26,736 --> 02:01:30,331
I don't think I want to ride.
I want to walk. It's good for the baby.

1328
02:01:30,496 --> 02:01:31,815
The baby does what I say.

1329
02:01:32,176 --> 02:01:35,373
- Well, may I steer?
- Sure, you can steer.

1330
02:01:37,256 --> 02:01:38,575
Ready?

1331
02:02:25,856 --> 02:02:27,255
Hello.

1332
02:02:30,736 --> 02:02:32,374
- Will it take much longer?
- No.

1333
02:02:32,536 --> 02:02:35,130
Don't be impatient.
She's doing a beautiful job.

1334
02:02:35,296 --> 02:02:37,890
I must look my best
when I meet little Catherine.

1335
02:02:38,056 --> 02:02:39,330
She'll be very impressed.

1336
02:02:39,496 --> 02:02:43,011
- Is this your first child, madame?
- No. We have two boys.

1337
02:02:43,176 --> 02:02:44,655
That is wonderful.

1338
02:02:44,816 --> 02:02:46,329
And two girls.

1339
02:02:46,536 --> 02:02:48,731
Oh, monsieur!

1340
02:02:53,256 --> 02:02:54,769
Hurry up.

1341
02:03:15,416 --> 02:03:18,135
She won't come between us,
will she? The little brat?

1342
02:03:18,296 --> 02:03:20,127
No, we'll keep her in a tree.

1343
02:03:20,296 --> 02:03:23,572
Won't it be fun?
There'll be three of us.

1344
02:03:35,336 --> 02:03:37,167
- Hello, Cat.
- Hello.

1345
02:03:37,336 --> 02:03:40,055
- How are you?
- I'm fine, darling.

1346
02:03:40,496 --> 02:03:42,054
I brought your things.

1347
02:03:42,256 --> 02:03:44,770
- Isn't the doctor here yet?
- In a few minutes.

1348
02:03:45,056 --> 02:03:48,810
- How is it?
- The pains are coming quite often now.

1349
02:03:50,256 --> 02:03:52,770
This is a real one.

1350
02:03:53,736 --> 02:03:55,806
You go away, darling.

1351
02:03:56,136 --> 02:03:58,206
- Go out and get some dinner.
- I couldn't.

1352
02:03:58,376 --> 02:04:00,765
I may do this for a long time,
the nurse says.

1353
02:04:00,936 --> 02:04:03,530
The first labor is usually protracted.

1354
02:04:03,976 --> 02:04:05,295
I'd rather stay.

1355
02:04:06,176 --> 02:04:11,375
Please go, darling. I think you're
just making me self-conscious.

1356
02:04:11,576 --> 02:04:15,330
I want to be a good wife, and have
this child without any foolishness.

1357
02:04:15,496 --> 02:04:17,885
You have time, if you would
like to get dinner.

1358
02:04:18,056 --> 02:04:21,969
No, I'll be just outside.

1359
02:04:33,576 --> 02:04:35,373
Can I go into the delivery room?

1360
02:04:35,536 --> 02:04:37,367
Yes, I'm sure it will be all right.

1361
02:04:37,536 --> 02:04:39,811
Thank you.

1362
02:04:41,976 --> 02:04:45,013
Bear down as hard as you can.

1363
02:04:54,696 --> 02:04:57,164
I'm having fine pains.

1364
02:04:57,416 --> 02:04:59,771
That was a very big one.

1365
02:05:00,056 --> 02:05:02,172
It will be soon, now. I can tell.

1366
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:06,375
Yes, my dear. We'll give you some
gas, to ease the pain.

1367
02:05:07,136 --> 02:05:09,445
I don't want to make any fuss.

1368
02:05:11,096 --> 02:05:13,166
- Darling?
- Yes.

1369
02:05:14,216 --> 02:05:16,855
I just wanted to be sure
you were here.

1370
02:05:17,296 --> 02:05:19,093
I won't leave.

1371
02:05:19,616 --> 02:05:21,572
That's a good boy.

1372
02:05:41,856 --> 02:05:46,372
Darling, I have the most
wonderful doctor.

1373
02:05:46,576 --> 02:05:49,932
He's been telling me
the most wonderful story.

1374
02:05:50,096 --> 02:05:54,806
When the pain came too badly,
he put me out. He's wonderful.

1375
02:05:54,976 --> 02:05:57,729
- You're wonderful, doctor.
- You're drunk.

1376
02:05:58,296 --> 02:06:02,005
I know it. But you shouldn't say it.

1377
02:06:05,296 --> 02:06:08,766
Give it to me!

1378
02:06:23,696 --> 02:06:26,256
I'm sorry I go on so long.

1379
02:06:26,496 --> 02:06:28,964
I thought I would do it so easily.

1380
02:06:29,896 --> 02:06:32,569
I try as hard as I can.

1381
02:06:32,736 --> 02:06:36,365
I push down but it goes away.

1382
02:06:40,016 --> 02:06:42,814
Here it comes!
Give it to...

1383
02:06:50,136 --> 02:06:53,651
Please, doctor, give me enough
to do some good.

1384
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:03,207
It doesn't work.

1385
02:07:03,376 --> 02:07:05,446
It doesn't work!

1386
02:07:06,416 --> 02:07:10,329
I don't care if I die, if it will only stop.

1387
02:07:12,376 --> 02:07:13,968
Please!

1388
02:07:14,216 --> 02:07:17,208
Please make it stop!

1389
02:07:17,496 --> 02:07:19,964
Can't they give me something?

1390
02:07:20,176 --> 02:07:24,169
- Doctor...
- lf they could only give me something.

1391
02:07:28,856 --> 02:07:31,051
It doesn't work.

1392
02:07:31,376 --> 02:07:33,492
Nothing works.

1393
02:07:35,576 --> 02:07:37,771
Oh, darling...

1394
02:07:38,256 --> 02:07:40,850
I'm just a fool.

1395
02:07:42,856 --> 02:07:47,850
I wanted so to have this baby and not
make trouble. And now I'm all gone.

1396
02:07:48,016 --> 02:07:52,771
- All gone to pieces. It doesn't work.
- My brave darling.

1397
02:07:53,056 --> 02:07:55,365
I'm not brave anymore...

1398
02:07:55,536 --> 02:07:57,413
...I'm all broken.

1399
02:07:57,576 --> 02:08:01,774
- In a little while...
- They just keep it up till they break you.

1400
02:08:02,016 --> 02:08:04,735
It'll be over in a little while.

1401
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:09,614
I won't die, will I, darling?

1402
02:08:09,776 --> 02:08:12,210
No. I promise you won't.

1403
02:08:13,776 --> 02:08:16,654
I don't want to die
and leave you, but I...

1404
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:20,451
...I get so tired of it...

1405
02:08:21,256 --> 02:08:23,087
...and I feel I'm going to die.

1406
02:08:23,256 --> 02:08:27,647
Nonsense. Everybody feels that.

1407
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:30,771
I always knew I was going to die.

1408
02:08:31,216 --> 02:08:34,572
You can't. You won't.
I won't let you.

1409
02:08:34,736 --> 02:08:36,647
You wouldn't do any such foolishness.

1410
02:08:36,816 --> 02:08:39,125
You wouldn't die
and leave your husband.

1411
02:08:43,456 --> 02:08:45,606
Don't mind me, darling.

1412
02:08:46,496 --> 02:08:49,294
I've just gone all to pieces.

1413
02:08:52,176 --> 02:08:54,167
I love you so.

1414
02:08:56,016 --> 02:08:57,768
I'll be good again.

1415
02:08:58,656 --> 02:09:02,092
You'll be all right, Cat.
You'll be all right.

1416
02:09:02,256 --> 02:09:03,928
You're so good to me.

1417
02:09:04,096 --> 02:09:09,728
You will go, please, for a few minutes.
I will make an examination.

1418
02:09:10,416 --> 02:09:12,372
You can come back
afterward, darling.

1419
02:09:12,536 --> 02:09:16,768
- Can't he, doctor?
- I'll send word when he can come back.

1420
02:09:30,416 --> 02:09:32,566
Poor Catherine.

1421
02:09:57,176 --> 02:09:59,974
Mr. Henry.
The doctor wants to see you.

1422
02:10:00,496 --> 02:10:02,054
Is anything wrong?

1423
02:10:05,216 --> 02:10:07,013
How does it go, doctor?

1424
02:10:07,176 --> 02:10:08,768
It doesn't go.

1425
02:10:10,016 --> 02:10:13,008
But she was so healthy.
You said yourself she was.

1426
02:10:13,176 --> 02:10:18,170
Yes, I know. But somehow,
sometimes nature fails itself.

1427
02:10:19,616 --> 02:10:21,846
- What do you advise?
- There are two things.

1428
02:10:22,056 --> 02:10:25,685
Either a high-forceps delivery,
which can tear and is dangerous...

1429
02:10:25,856 --> 02:10:29,007
...besides being bad for the child,
or a cesarean.

1430
02:10:29,456 --> 02:10:33,847
- What's the danger of a cesarean?
- No greater than an ordinary delivery.

1431
02:10:34,056 --> 02:10:36,775
If it were my wife,
I would do a cesarean.

1432
02:10:38,336 --> 02:10:41,487
- What are the aftereffects?
- None. There is only the scar.

1433
02:10:41,656 --> 02:10:43,772
What if you just went on
and did nothing?

1434
02:10:43,936 --> 02:10:46,211
We would have to do something
eventually.

1435
02:10:46,376 --> 02:10:49,095
Mrs. Henry is already losing
much of her strength.

1436
02:10:49,256 --> 02:10:51,645
The sooner we operate, the safer.

1437
02:10:52,336 --> 02:10:56,295
- Operate as soon as you can.
- I'll go and give the instructions.

1438
02:11:12,176 --> 02:11:15,646
- Did you tell him he could do it?
- Yes.

1439
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:19,128
Isn't that grand?

1440
02:11:19,976 --> 02:11:23,013
Now it will all be over in no time.

1441
02:11:29,536 --> 02:11:32,767
- Darling?
- Yes, Cat?

1442
02:11:34,656 --> 02:11:37,409
Is it raining?

1443
02:11:39,816 --> 02:11:42,091
No, I don't think so.

1444
02:11:47,656 --> 02:11:49,772
I think it's raining.

1445
02:12:42,896 --> 02:12:45,285
It's a boy. Congratulations.

1446
02:12:45,456 --> 02:12:47,287
Aren't you proud?

1447
02:12:49,176 --> 02:12:51,485
He nearly killed his mother.

1448
02:12:59,936 --> 02:13:02,496
You may come in now,
for a moment.

1449
02:13:13,256 --> 02:13:15,531
I love you, sweetie.

1450
02:13:16,656 --> 02:13:19,250
What sort of a baby is it?

1451
02:13:20,816 --> 02:13:25,731
It's a boy. Long and wide and dark.

1452
02:13:29,696 --> 02:13:33,848
- Is he all right?
- Yes, he's fine.

1453
02:13:37,816 --> 02:13:41,604
I'm awfully tired. I hurt like hell.

1454
02:13:41,776 --> 02:13:44,848
Madame Henry mustn't talk too much.

1455
02:13:46,096 --> 02:13:49,054
You haven't eaten all day, darling.

1456
02:13:49,216 --> 02:13:53,767
Go and eat something. I'll be
all right when you come back.

1457
02:13:55,016 --> 02:13:57,928
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

1458
02:14:00,696 --> 02:14:02,687
Have a nice dinner.

1459
02:14:10,296 --> 02:14:14,084
- Mr. Henry.
- Yes, doctor.

1460
02:14:19,136 --> 02:14:20,569
I'm sorry about the baby.

1461
02:14:20,736 --> 02:14:22,294
What about the baby?

1462
02:14:22,456 --> 02:14:25,653
The terrible labor, the whole ordeal,
it was too much for him.

1463
02:14:25,816 --> 02:14:27,966
We couldn't start him breathing.

1464
02:14:29,736 --> 02:14:31,010
So he's dead.

1465
02:14:31,176 --> 02:14:33,770
Yes. We tried everything.

1466
02:14:36,296 --> 02:14:39,208
- What about her?
- She'll be all right, my boy.

1467
02:14:39,376 --> 02:14:42,049
Come, have a cup of coffee with me.

1468
02:14:42,216 --> 02:14:45,288
I assure you, she'll be all right.

1469
02:14:57,296 --> 02:15:00,652
Yes, coffee and brioche.
The alcove, please.

1470
02:15:00,816 --> 02:15:03,171
- It will be free in two minutes.
- We'll wait.

1471
02:15:03,336 --> 02:15:05,930
It's true, even the German
communique admits it.

1472
02:15:06,096 --> 02:15:09,293
A month ago they said only a miracle
could save the Italians.

1473
02:15:09,456 --> 02:15:13,335
Well, the miracle has happened.
The Italians are holding the Piave River.

1474
02:15:13,496 --> 02:15:16,693
Poor Cat. She wanted this baby
so much.

1475
02:15:16,856 --> 02:15:19,086
The table is ready, doctor.

1476
02:15:32,256 --> 02:15:36,568
I don't understand it. I felt him kick.

1477
02:15:36,736 --> 02:15:39,887
He was alive inside Catherine.

1478
02:15:40,056 --> 02:15:42,729
Except the last week.

1479
02:15:42,896 --> 02:15:46,332
The last week he was quiet.
Maybe he was dead all the time.

1480
02:15:46,496 --> 02:15:49,886
- Drink your coffee, my boy.
- Poor kid.

1481
02:15:50,056 --> 02:15:52,934
Never even had a chance.

1482
02:15:53,096 --> 02:15:55,530
Maybe it's just as well.

1483
02:15:55,696 --> 02:15:57,095
They kill you in the end.

1484
02:15:57,256 --> 02:16:01,454
Maybe it's better that way than
to wind up dead on a muddy road.

1485
02:16:01,616 --> 02:16:04,813
You don't know what it's about.
You never have time to learn.

1486
02:16:04,976 --> 02:16:07,206
They throw you in
and tell you the rules...

1487
02:16:07,376 --> 02:16:10,686
...and the first time they catch you
off base, they kill you.

1488
02:16:10,856 --> 02:16:15,168
You can count on that.
Stay around and they'll kill you.

1489
02:16:17,216 --> 02:16:19,047
Poor Cat.

1490
02:16:20,896 --> 02:16:23,456
Poor, dear Cat.

1491
02:16:24,216 --> 02:16:27,731
This is the price you pay
for sleeping together.

1492
02:16:28,456 --> 02:16:31,732
She didn't have a bad time
when she was pregnant.

1493
02:16:31,896 --> 02:16:34,126
She was hardly ever sick.

1494
02:16:34,296 --> 02:16:39,006
She wasn't even very uncomfortable,
until towards the last.

1495
02:16:40,496 --> 02:16:43,568
But you never get away with anything.

1496
02:16:43,736 --> 02:16:45,852
Get away? Hell!

1497
02:16:47,096 --> 02:16:49,690
They get you in the end.

1498
02:16:51,256 --> 02:16:53,690
Maybe they're gonna get her too.

1499
02:16:55,456 --> 02:16:57,367
She's not gonna die, is she?

1500
02:16:57,536 --> 02:16:59,572
No, my boy. I'm sure.

1501
02:16:59,736 --> 02:17:01,966
You were sure about the baby too.

1502
02:17:02,136 --> 02:17:04,206
What if she should die?

1503
02:17:04,696 --> 02:17:07,051
She's coming along fine.
Don't you worry.

1504
02:17:07,216 --> 02:17:08,729
Dr. Emerich.

1505
02:17:11,296 --> 02:17:13,048
Excuse me, Mr. Henry. I'm wanted.

1506
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:15,889
Finish your coffee, I'll meet you
later at the hospital.

1507
02:17:19,896 --> 02:17:22,456
She said she felt like hell.

1508
02:17:24,136 --> 02:17:26,411
What if she should die?

1509
02:17:27,856 --> 02:17:32,976
No, she won't die. People don't die
in childbirth nowadays.

1510
02:17:34,056 --> 02:17:38,334
Yes, but that's what
all husbands think.

1511
02:17:39,336 --> 02:17:41,645
What if she should die?

1512
02:17:42,936 --> 02:17:46,485
No. She's just having a bad time.
That's it.

1513
02:17:46,696 --> 02:17:48,846
Afterwards, we'll say,
"What a bad time."

1514
02:17:49,016 --> 02:17:52,326
And Catherine will say,
"Oh, it really wasn't so bad."

1515
02:17:54,616 --> 02:17:57,130
But what if she should die?

1516
02:18:02,696 --> 02:18:04,766
But what if she should?

1517
02:18:04,936 --> 02:18:06,892
But what if she should?

1518
02:18:20,456 --> 02:18:23,414
Oh, Mr. Henry.
I just tried to telephone you.

1519
02:18:23,576 --> 02:18:27,205
- What's wrong?
- Madame Henry has had a hemorrhage.

1520
02:18:29,136 --> 02:18:31,604
- Can I go in?
- Not yet.

1521
02:18:33,176 --> 02:18:36,407
- Is it dangerous?
- It is very dangerous.

1522
02:18:47,576 --> 02:18:49,453
Oh, God.

1523
02:18:50,336 --> 02:18:52,645
Please don't let her die.

1524
02:18:54,936 --> 02:18:59,327
I'll do anything,
if you won't let her die.

1525
02:19:01,456 --> 02:19:04,334
Whatever wrong I've done...

1526
02:19:04,496 --> 02:19:09,445
Please, dear God, don't let her die.

1527
02:19:12,536 --> 02:19:16,814
You took our baby,
but don't let her die.

1528
02:19:18,336 --> 02:19:21,885
Please. Please, dear God.

1529
02:19:22,056 --> 02:19:23,614
Don't...

1530
02:19:26,736 --> 02:19:28,613
Mr. Henry.

1531
02:19:46,056 --> 02:19:48,650
Cat.

1532
02:19:53,376 --> 02:19:56,925
You're all right.
You're going to be all right.

1533
02:19:58,736 --> 02:20:01,614
Our baby's dead, isn't he?

1534
02:20:06,016 --> 02:20:08,689
I'm going to die too.

1535
02:20:09,816 --> 02:20:11,932
I hate it.

1536
02:20:14,576 --> 02:20:16,851
Don't touch me.

1537
02:20:24,656 --> 02:20:26,806
Poor darling.

1538
02:20:28,696 --> 02:20:32,006
You touch me all you want.

1539
02:20:32,176 --> 02:20:34,406
You'll be all right, Catherine.

1540
02:20:34,576 --> 02:20:36,851
I know you'll be all right.

1541
02:20:39,056 --> 02:20:42,492
I meant to write you a letter to have...

1542
02:20:42,656 --> 02:20:44,806
...if anything happened.

1543
02:20:45,856 --> 02:20:47,847
I didn't do it.

1544
02:20:50,536 --> 02:20:52,766
Do you want me to do anything?

1545
02:20:54,176 --> 02:20:58,613
Do you want me to... send for anybody?

1546
02:21:00,456 --> 02:21:02,367
Just you.

1547
02:21:06,576 --> 02:21:08,771
I'm not afraid.

1548
02:21:11,216 --> 02:21:13,525
I just hate it.

1549
02:21:21,336 --> 02:21:23,327
It's been sweet.

1550
02:21:29,296 --> 02:21:30,934
Darling.

1551
02:21:33,856 --> 02:21:37,371
You won't do our things
with another girl...

1552
02:21:39,176 --> 02:21:42,885
...or say the same things, will you?

1553
02:21:43,056 --> 02:21:44,489
No.

1554
02:21:47,296 --> 02:21:50,413
I want you to have girls, though.

1555
02:21:52,376 --> 02:21:54,571
I don't want to.

1556
02:21:59,736 --> 02:22:03,365
I'll come and stay with you nights.

1557
02:22:08,016 --> 02:22:11,247
I'm not a bit afraid, darling.

1558
02:22:12,616 --> 02:22:15,574
It's just a dirty trick.

1559
02:22:38,696 --> 02:22:40,573
Can I do anything?

1560
02:22:40,736 --> 02:22:42,806
No, just leave us alone.

1561
02:22:42,976 --> 02:22:47,367
- I think it might be better if...
- Get out. Both of you.

1562
02:23:08,336 --> 02:23:10,008
Darling.

1563
02:23:11,456 --> 02:23:13,970
My wonderful darling.

1564
02:23:15,776 --> 02:23:18,085
You'll never leave me.

1565
02:23:20,176 --> 02:23:24,010
You're with me till I die.

1566
02:23:25,376 --> 02:23:26,855
My darling.

1567
02:23:29,736 --> 02:23:31,613
Till I die.

1568
02:23:36,056 --> 02:23:37,535
Cold.

1569
02:23:40,696 --> 02:23:42,288
Cold.

1570
02:23:46,456 --> 02:23:48,970
You're so cold, Cat.

1571
02:23:51,256 --> 02:23:53,292
Like a statue.

1572
02:24:28,456 --> 02:24:32,005
Won 't it be fun?
There'll be three of us.

1573
02:24:34,936 --> 02:24:37,894
I'm not a bit afraid, darling.

1574
02:24:38,976 --> 02:24:41,171
I just hate it.

1575
02:24:44,336 --> 02:24:48,011
Darling. You will be good to me,
won't you?

1576
02:24:49,856 --> 02:24:52,689
You will, won't you?

1577
02:24:52,856 --> 02:24:55,848
Because we're going to have
a strange life.

1578
02:25:01,256 --> 02:25:03,975
But it's the only life I want.

1579
