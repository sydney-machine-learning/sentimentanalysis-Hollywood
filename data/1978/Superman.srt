1
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:45,071
<i>"In the decade of the 1930s
even the great city of Metropolis...</i>

2
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,240
<i>"... was not spared the ravages
of the worldwide depression.</i>

3
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:51,450
<i>"In the times of fear and confusion...</i>

4
00:00:51,576 --> 00:00:55,455
<i>"... the job of informing the public
was the responsibility...</i>

5
00:00:55,538 --> 00:00:56,956
<i>"... of the Daily Planet.</i>

6
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,292
<i>"A great metropolitan newspaper...</i>

7
00:00:59,376 --> 00:01:04,506
<i>"... whose reputation for clarity and truth
had become a symbol of hope...</i>

8
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,841
<i>"... for the city of Metropolis."</i>

9
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:43,303
This is no fantasy.

10
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:47,557
No careless product of wild imagination.

11
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:50,226
No, my good friends...

12
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:53,980
...these indictments...

13
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,650
...I've brought you today...

14
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:02,697
...specific charges listed herein
against the individuals...

15
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:07,535
...their acts of treason.
Their ultimate aim of sedition.

16
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:11,831
These...

17
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,836
...are matters of undeniable fact.

18
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:23,343
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...

19
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,179
...on those accused.

20
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:35,146
On this...

21
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:37,941
...this mindless aberration...

22
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:42,237
...whose only means of expression
are wanton violence and destruction.

23
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:46,991
On the woman, Ursa...

24
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:50,829
...whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...

25
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:54,416
...have threatened even the children
of the Planet Krypton.

26
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:05,301
Finally, General Zod.

27
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:08,763
Once trusted by this Council...

28
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:12,684
...charged with maintaining the defense
of the Planet Krypton itself.

29
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:17,272
Chief Architect of this intended revolution
and author of this insidious plot...

30
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:20,608
...to establish a new order amongst us...

31
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:24,988
...with himself as absolute ruler.

32
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,200
You have heard the evidence.

33
00:08:30,702 --> 00:08:33,121
The decision of the Council
will now be heard.

34
00:08:33,204 --> 00:08:34,039
<i>Guilty!</i>

35
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,250
<i>Guilty!</i>

36
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:39,836
<i>Guilty!</i>

37
00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:45,133
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El.

38
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:48,470
It has therefore now become your decision.

39
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:51,056
You alone will condemn us if you wish...

40
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:53,975
...and you alone will be held responsible
by me!

41
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:03,818
Join us!

42
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:09,074
You have been known to disagree
with the Council before.

43
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,953
Yours could become an important voice
in the new order, second only to my own!

44
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:18,249
I offer you a chance for greatness, Jor-El!

45
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,627
Take it! Join us!

46
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,714
You will bow down before me, Jor-El.

47
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:28,301
I swear it!
No matter that it takes an eternity!

48
00:09:28,927 --> 00:09:31,388
You will bow down before me!

49
00:09:31,763 --> 00:09:34,140
Both you and then one day...

50
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:35,558
...your heirs!

51
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:09,486
<i>Forgive me, forgive me...</i>

52
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,341
An unpleasant duty
has been masterly performed, Jor-El.

53
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:34,511
They have received the fate they deserved.

54
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:37,555
Isolation in the Phantom Zone...

55
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,766
...an eternal living death.

56
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:43,937
A chance for life, nonetheless.

57
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:46,481
As opposed to us.

58
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:49,025
It's suicide.

59
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:52,362
No, it's worse, it's genocide.

60
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:54,406
Be warned, Jor-El.

61
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:58,868
The Council has already evaluated
this outlandish theory of yours.

62
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:03,581
My friends, you know me
to be neither rash nor impulsive.

63
00:12:04,874 --> 00:12:08,795
I am not given
to wild unsupported statements...

64
00:12:10,004 --> 00:12:13,174
...and I tell you that we must evacuate
this planet immediately.

65
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:17,470
Jor-El, you are one
of Krypton's greatest scientists.

66
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:19,514
Yes, but so is Vond-Ah.

67
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:26,396
I don't question your data.

68
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:28,565
The facts are undeniable.

69
00:12:32,527 --> 00:12:34,863
It's your conclusions
we find unsupportable.

70
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:40,910
This planet will explode within 30 days.

71
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:42,245
If not sooner.

72
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,498
I tell you Krypton
is simply shifting its orbit.

73
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:47,208
Jor-El...

74
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:49,169
...be reasonable.

75
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:52,714
My friend...

76
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,636
...I have never been otherwise.
This madness is yours.

77
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,680
This discussion is terminated.

78
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,809
The decision of the Council is final.

79
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,623
Any attempt by you to create...

80
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:30,460
...a climate of fear and panic
among the populace...

81
00:13:30,585 --> 00:13:34,297
...must be deemed by us
an act of insurrection.

82
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,092
You would accuse me of insurrection?

83
00:13:38,343 --> 00:13:40,845
Has it now become a crime to cherish life?

84
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,100
You would be banished
to endless imprisonment...

85
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:47,143
...in the Phantom Zone:

86
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,020
The eternal void...

87
00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:52,190
...which you, yourself discovered.

88
00:13:53,942 --> 00:13:57,696
Will you abide by the Council's decision?

89
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:04,786
I will remain silent.

90
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:09,666
Neither I, nor my wife...

91
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,292
...will leave Krypton.

92
00:15:07,432 --> 00:15:08,558
Have you finished?

93
00:15:11,895 --> 00:15:12,687
Nearly.

94
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:20,236
It's the only answer, Lara.

95
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:22,155
If he remains here with us...

96
00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:25,658
...he will die as surely as we will.

97
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:27,243
But why Earth, Jor-El?

98
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:29,954
They're primitives,
thousands of years behind us.

99
00:15:30,372 --> 00:15:32,665
He will need that advantage to survive.

100
00:15:35,085 --> 00:15:36,753
Their atmosphere will...

101
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:39,547
...sustain him.

102
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:49,599
He will defy their gravity.

103
00:15:49,808 --> 00:15:51,726
He will look like one of them.

104
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:54,604
He won't be one of them.

105
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:56,106
No.

106
00:15:56,981 --> 00:16:00,193
His dense molecular structure
will make him strong.

107
00:16:01,986 --> 00:16:04,447
He'll be odd. Different.

108
00:16:06,616 --> 00:16:09,744
He'll be fast. Virtually invulnerable.

109
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:14,040
Isolated. Alone.

110
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:19,754
He will not be alone.

111
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:27,679
He will never be alone.

112
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,400
The energy input to Jor-El's quarters
is now in excess.

113
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,820
Our data indicates the loss
is due to a misuse of energy.

114
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:45,864
Investigate.

115
00:16:46,823 --> 00:16:49,993
And if the investigation proves correct?

116
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,997
He knew the penalty he faced.

117
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,542
He even is a member of this Council.

118
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:01,880
The law will be upheld.

119
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:47,258
You will travel far, my little Kal-El.

120
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:51,304
But we will never leave you.

121
00:17:52,889 --> 00:17:54,641
Even in the face of our death...

122
00:17:56,017 --> 00:17:57,894
...the richness of our lives...

123
00:17:59,771 --> 00:18:01,231
...shall be yours.

124
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:05,944
All that I have, all that I've learned,
everything I feel...

125
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,072
...all this and more, I...

126
00:18:11,408 --> 00:18:13,159
...I bequeath you, my son.

127
00:18:16,913 --> 00:18:18,790
You will carry me inside you...

128
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,085
...all the days of your life.

129
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,964
You will make my strength your own...

130
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:29,342
...see my life through your eyes...

131
00:18:30,093 --> 00:18:32,429
...as your life will be seen through mine.

132
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:38,143
The son becomes the father,
and the father...

133
00:18:39,227 --> 00:18:40,562
...the son.

134
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:45,734
This is all I...

135
00:18:48,737 --> 00:18:52,449
...all I can send you, Kal-El.

136
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,335
<i>...which Einstein called his theory
of relativity.</i>

137
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:17,213
<i>Embedded in the crystals before you...</i>

138
00:23:17,881 --> 00:23:21,801
<i>...is the total accumulation of all literature
and scientific fact from dozens...</i>

139
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:23,094
<i>...of other worlds...</i>

140
00:23:23,219 --> 00:23:25,513
<i>...spanning the 28 known galaxies.</i>

141
00:23:46,242 --> 00:23:50,246
<i>Early Chinese writings point out
the complex relationship...</i>

142
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:56,836
<i>By carrying this complex equation
to its ultimate power, my son...</i>

143
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:03,551
<i>Chief among these powers
will be your sight...</i>

144
00:24:03,635 --> 00:24:05,595
<i>...your strength, your hearing...</i>

145
00:24:06,054 --> 00:24:09,307
<i>...your ability to propel yourself
at almost limitless speed.</i>

146
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,313
<i>The early history of our universe was
a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war.</i>

147
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:18,608
<i>Each of the six galaxies
which you will pass through...</i>

148
00:24:18,942 --> 00:24:21,695
<i>...contain their own individual law
of space and time.</i>

149
00:24:21,778 --> 00:24:25,031
<i>It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.</i>

150
00:24:58,356 --> 00:24:59,858
- What!
- What was that?

151
00:25:24,674 --> 00:25:27,218
<i>Now wouldn't that beat all get out.
Well, you...</i>

152
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:38,229
Oh, Pa!

153
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:40,023
Oh, my.

154
00:26:13,723 --> 00:26:15,809
All these years, as happy as we've been...

155
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:19,562
...how I've prayed the good Lord
would see fit to give us a child.

156
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,317
Honey, will you hand me that rag up there.

157
00:26:24,734 --> 00:26:26,194
You take things easy now.

158
00:26:26,277 --> 00:26:29,155
Remember what Doc Frye said
about that heart of yours.

159
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:38,206
Now the first thing we've got to do
when we get home is find out...

160
00:26:38,873 --> 00:26:40,750
...who that boy's proper family is.

161
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:44,504
He hasn't got any.
Not around here, anyway.

162
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:51,386
Are you thinking
what I think you are thinking?

163
00:26:52,637 --> 00:26:56,266
We could say he's the child of my cousin
in North Dakota...

164
00:26:57,058 --> 00:26:58,560
...and just now orphaned.

165
00:27:00,979 --> 00:27:03,356
Jonathan, he's only a baby.

166
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,110
Martha, now you saw how we found him.

167
00:27:10,447 --> 00:27:13,283
Martha Clark Kent,
are you listening to what I'm saying?

168
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:47,734
Come on, gang.

169
00:27:51,154 --> 00:27:53,531
That was a great game.

170
00:27:54,783 --> 00:27:55,825
All right.

171
00:27:57,452 --> 00:28:00,205
Come on, hustle, let's go.
Stack your helmets neatly.

172
00:28:00,872 --> 00:28:03,124
Remember about the uniforms,
cleaned and washed...

173
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,752
...by tomorrow,
and looking like a football team.

174
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:09,464
Let's have those clothes washed and ready
for tomorrow's game.

175
00:28:09,547 --> 00:28:11,007
Got to beat Mount Vernon High.

176
00:28:11,674 --> 00:28:13,051
Can you give me a lift?

177
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:20,684
Lana?

178
00:28:20,892 --> 00:28:24,688
Don't bother with these.
I'll take them in with the other equipment.

179
00:28:26,022 --> 00:28:28,233
- Thank you, Clark.
- Sure.

180
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:32,278
Listen, a whole bunch of us are going up
to Mary Ellen's.

181
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:35,865
Play some records.
Would you like to come?

182
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:38,785
Sure.

183
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:40,912
Sounds like it could be a lot of fun.

184
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:43,790
Kent can't make it.
Still got a lot of work to do.

185
00:28:44,332 --> 00:28:47,043
<i>What are you talking about?
I've just finished stacking...</i>

186
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,211
All that?

187
00:28:49,212 --> 00:28:50,380
Oh, Brad!

188
00:28:51,506 --> 00:28:52,924
Hey, come on, Lana.

189
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:56,553
Come on, let's go.

190
00:28:57,721 --> 00:28:59,264
- He has to clean up.
- 'Bye, Clark.

191
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:01,391
- 'Bye, Lana.
- Clean this up, Clark.

192
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:05,228
'Bye, Clark.

193
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,569
'Bye, Clark.

194
00:29:13,236 --> 00:29:15,238
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

195
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:28,937
Golly! I saw a boy out there
run as fast as the train!

196
00:30:29,104 --> 00:30:30,480
Faster, even!

197
00:30:31,314 --> 00:30:34,859
Lois Lane,
you have a writer's gift for invention.

198
00:30:34,943 --> 00:30:36,945
- I'll say that for you.
- But...

199
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:39,406
Lois, please read your book.

200
00:30:40,615 --> 00:30:41,866
No one ever believes me.

201
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,817
Hey, look, there's Clark!

202
00:31:18,862 --> 00:31:19,863
Clark?

203
00:31:20,905 --> 00:31:22,532
How did you get here so fast?

204
00:31:23,658 --> 00:31:24,576
I ran.

205
00:31:24,868 --> 00:31:26,077
Ran, huh?

206
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:29,247
Told you he was an oddball,
let's get out of here.

207
00:31:36,337 --> 00:31:38,506
Been showing off a bit, haven't you, Son?

208
00:31:51,478 --> 00:31:53,229
I didn't mean to show off, Pa.

209
00:31:57,025 --> 00:32:00,695
It's just that guys like that Brad,
I just want to tear them apart.

210
00:32:00,904 --> 00:32:01,905
Yeah, I know.

211
00:32:02,781 --> 00:32:04,240
Yeah, I know I shouldn't.

212
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:07,160
Yeah, I know you can do
all these amazing things...

213
00:32:07,243 --> 00:32:09,996
...and sometimes you think
that you will just go bust...

214
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,040
...unless you can tell people about it.

215
00:32:12,123 --> 00:32:13,416
- Yeah.
- That's right.

216
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,461
I mean, every time I get the football
I can make a touchdown.

217
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:18,380
- That's for sure.
- Every time.

218
00:32:18,713 --> 00:32:22,258
Is it showing off when somebody's doing
the things he's capable of doing?

219
00:32:22,425 --> 00:32:24,344
Is a bird showing off when it flies?

220
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:27,138
No, now, you listen to me.

221
00:32:27,972 --> 00:32:29,849
When you came to us, we thought...

222
00:32:29,933 --> 00:32:31,893
...people would take you away...

223
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:34,729
...when they found out
the things that you do.

224
00:32:34,938 --> 00:32:36,773
It worried us a lot.

225
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,276
Then when a man gets older
and he thinks very differently.

226
00:32:40,735 --> 00:32:42,570
And things get very clear.

227
00:32:42,946 --> 00:32:47,659
And there's one thing I do know, Son,
and that is you are here for a reason.

228
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:51,037
I don't know whose reason,
or whatever the reason is...

229
00:32:51,121 --> 00:32:52,706
<i>...maybe it's because...</i>

230
00:32:56,835 --> 00:32:57,961
I don't know.

231
00:33:00,296 --> 00:33:03,758
But I do know one thing.
It's not to score touchdowns.

232
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:08,513
Thanks, Dad.

233
00:33:10,181 --> 00:33:11,891
I'll race you to it. Yeah.

234
00:33:12,142 --> 00:33:13,101
You will?

235
00:33:13,435 --> 00:33:15,395
Run. Come on, come on. Move, move.

236
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:18,440
Go, go. Come on. Hey, Baron.

237
00:33:49,888 --> 00:33:51,348
Jonathan!

238
00:33:57,687 --> 00:33:58,688
Dad.

239
00:34:49,864 --> 00:34:52,200
All those things I can do...

240
00:34:53,952 --> 00:34:55,912
...all those powers...

241
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:00,125
...and I couldn't even save him.

242
00:38:00,096 --> 00:38:02,098
Clark, get up.

243
00:38:06,561 --> 00:38:08,355
Good morning, Smiley.

244
00:38:09,689 --> 00:38:11,775
Clark, breakfast.

245
00:38:15,612 --> 00:38:17,781
Are you going to sleep all day?

246
00:38:19,616 --> 00:38:21,910
Clark, come on. Get up.

247
00:39:22,971 --> 00:39:24,180
I have to leave.

248
00:39:30,562 --> 00:39:32,647
I knew this time would come.

249
00:39:33,857 --> 00:39:36,609
We both knew it
from the day we found you.

250
00:39:48,538 --> 00:39:50,582
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday.

251
00:39:52,584 --> 00:39:56,755
He said that he'd be happy
to help out from now on.

252
00:40:06,056 --> 00:40:06,931
Mother!

253
00:40:08,558 --> 00:40:09,642
I know, Son.

254
00:40:12,228 --> 00:40:13,229
I know.

255
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:20,403
Do you know where you're headed?

256
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:26,034
North.

257
00:40:31,915 --> 00:40:33,208
Remember us, Son.

258
00:40:35,585 --> 00:40:37,045
Always remember us.

259
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:15,133
<i>My son...</i>

260
00:46:22,474 --> 00:46:24,225
<i>...you do not remember me.</i>

261
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:26,936
<i>I am Jor-El.</i>

262
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:30,023
<i>I am your father.</i>

263
00:46:32,525 --> 00:46:35,195
<i>By now you will have reached
your eighteenth year...</i>

264
00:46:35,862 --> 00:46:37,614
<i>...as it is measured on Earth.</i>

265
00:46:38,698 --> 00:46:40,200
<i>By that reckoning...</i>

266
00:46:41,284 --> 00:46:44,329
<i>...I will have been dead
for many thousands of your years.</i>

267
00:46:46,915 --> 00:46:48,124
<i>The knowledge...</i>

268
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:52,587
<i>...that I have of matters,
physical and historical...</i>

269
00:46:53,088 --> 00:46:56,299
<i>...I have given you fully on your voyage
to your new home.</i>

270
00:46:57,509 --> 00:46:59,678
<i>These are important matters to be sure...</i>

271
00:47:00,553 --> 00:47:02,764
<i>...but still matters of mere fact.</i>

272
00:47:04,474 --> 00:47:06,309
<i>There are questions to be asked...</i>

273
00:47:07,435 --> 00:47:10,063
<i>...and it is time for you to do so.</i>

274
00:47:13,024 --> 00:47:14,234
<i>Here, in this...</i>

275
00:47:15,694 --> 00:47:18,238
<i>...this fortress of solitude...</i>

276
00:47:19,989 --> 00:47:22,409
<i>...we shall try to find the answers together.</i>

277
00:47:24,327 --> 00:47:25,495
<i>So, my son...</i>

278
00:47:26,955 --> 00:47:27,789
<i>...speak.</i>

279
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,709
Who am I?

280
00:47:32,001 --> 00:47:33,294
<i>Your name is Kal-El.</i>

281
00:47:34,963 --> 00:47:38,049
<i>You are the only survivor
of the Planet Krypton.</i>

282
00:47:39,009 --> 00:47:43,013
<i>Even though you were raised
as a human, you are not one of them.</i>

283
00:47:44,264 --> 00:47:48,018
<i>You have great powers,
only some of which you have...</i>

284
00:47:48,643 --> 00:47:50,020
<i>...as yet discovered.</i>

285
00:47:53,023 --> 00:47:54,607
<i>Come with me now, my son...</i>

286
00:47:54,691 --> 00:47:57,610
<i>...as we break through the bars
of your earthly confinement.</i>

287
00:47:57,694 --> 00:47:59,863
<i>Traveling through time and space.</i>

288
00:48:01,448 --> 00:48:05,160
<i>Your powers will far exceed
those of mortal men.</i>

289
00:48:05,243 --> 00:48:08,038
<i>It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.</i>

290
00:48:08,163 --> 00:48:11,332
<i>Rather let your leadership stir others to.</i>

291
00:48:13,251 --> 00:48:17,172
<i>In the next year,
we shall examine the human heart.</i>

292
00:48:18,298 --> 00:48:20,383
<i>It is more fragile than your own.</i>

293
00:48:22,594 --> 00:48:26,556
<i>As we pass through the flaming turmoil
which is the edge of your own galaxy...</i>

294
00:48:27,265 --> 00:48:29,809
<i>...we will enter the realm
of the red Krypton sun...</i>

295
00:48:29,893 --> 00:48:32,228
<i>...source of your strength
and nourishment...</i>

296
00:48:32,395 --> 00:48:34,814
<i>...and cause of our eventual destruction.</i>

297
00:48:36,274 --> 00:48:38,777
<i>The Planet Krypton, my son...</i>

298
00:48:39,652 --> 00:48:41,863
<i>...your home as it was.</i>

299
00:48:43,948 --> 00:48:47,744
<i>This year we shall examine
the various concepts of immortality...</i>

300
00:48:48,203 --> 00:48:50,163
<i>...and their basis in actual fact.</i>

301
00:48:51,331 --> 00:48:55,460
<i>The total accumulation of all knowledge
spanning the 28 known galaxies...</i>

302
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,130
<i>...is embedded in the crystals
which I have sent along with you.</i>

303
00:48:59,547 --> 00:49:01,174
<i>Study them well, my son.</i>

304
00:49:04,761 --> 00:49:07,889
<i>By the time you return to the confines
of your galaxy...</i>

305
00:49:08,348 --> 00:49:10,558
<i>...twelve of your years will have passed.</i>

306
00:49:11,184 --> 00:49:12,936
<i>For this reason, among others...</i>

307
00:49:14,104 --> 00:49:16,064
<i>...I have chosen Earth for you.</i>

308
00:49:16,314 --> 00:49:19,109
<i>It is now time for you to rejoin
your new world...</i>

309
00:49:19,984 --> 00:49:22,278
<i>...and to serve its collective humanity.</i>

310
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,782
<i>Live as one of them, Kal-El...</i>

311
00:49:26,616 --> 00:49:29,744
<i>...and discover where your strength
and your power are needed.</i>

312
00:49:30,078 --> 00:49:34,708
<i>But always hold in your heart the pride
of your special heritage.</i>

313
00:49:36,084 --> 00:49:38,795
<i>They can be a great people, Kal-El,
they wish to be.</i>

314
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:42,132
<i>They only lack the light to show the way.</i>

315
00:49:44,134 --> 00:49:47,262
<i>For this reason, above all,
their capacity for good...</i>

316
00:49:48,763 --> 00:49:50,265
<i>...I have sent them you...</i>

317
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,685
<i>...my only son.</i>

318
00:50:30,055 --> 00:50:32,682
<i>Okay, this is it, mac, the Daily Planet.</i>

319
00:50:33,224 --> 00:50:37,020
Fresh fruit!
Hey, how about a tomato, lady?

320
00:50:37,645 --> 00:50:39,814
Hey, fresh fruit and vegetables.

321
00:51:12,222 --> 00:51:13,139
Smile.

322
00:51:15,642 --> 00:51:17,394
How many "T's" in "bloodletting"?

323
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:18,395
Two.

324
00:51:24,943 --> 00:51:26,277
What are you writing?

325
00:51:26,403 --> 00:51:28,738
An ode to spring.
How do you spell "massacre"?

326
00:51:29,698 --> 00:51:34,119
M- a-s-s-a-c-r-e.

327
00:51:34,786 --> 00:51:35,662
Thanks.

328
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,581
Golly, how come you get
all the great stories?

329
00:51:38,665 --> 00:51:40,834
A good reporter doesn't get great stories.

330
00:51:40,917 --> 00:51:42,335
A good reporter makes them great.

331
00:51:42,419 --> 00:51:44,504
Chief, here's that story on the murder case.

332
00:51:44,587 --> 00:51:47,924
The way I see it, it's a headline
on the front page with my picture...

333
00:51:48,008 --> 00:51:51,594
There's only one "P" in "rapist."
Lois Lane, say hello to Clark Kent.

334
00:51:52,012 --> 00:51:53,513
Hello, Miss Lane, how are...

335
00:51:57,934 --> 00:52:00,061
How are you doing?
Jimmy Olsen, photographer.

336
00:52:00,145 --> 00:52:02,022
Hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you.

337
00:52:03,398 --> 00:52:06,151
It's got everything:
Sex, violence, the ethnic angle.

338
00:52:06,443 --> 00:52:08,820
So does a lady wrestler
with a foreign accent.

339
00:52:08,903 --> 00:52:11,031
- Kent, can you open this?
- Sure, Mr. White.

340
00:52:11,114 --> 00:52:13,366
This could be the basis
for a series of articles:

341
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:16,244
"Making Sense of Senseless Killings"
by Lois Lane.

342
00:52:16,536 --> 00:52:19,164
<i>We get psychologists,
sociologists, interviews...</i>

343
00:52:19,247 --> 00:52:22,709
Lois, you're pushing a bunch
of rinky-dink tabloid garbage.

344
00:52:23,043 --> 00:52:25,045
<i>The Daily Planet has a tradition...</i>

345
00:52:25,128 --> 00:52:26,629
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

346
00:52:27,047 --> 00:52:29,632
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to shake it up like that.

347
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:31,426
Of course not, Lois.

348
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:35,180
Why would any one want to make
a total stranger look like a fool?

349
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:38,433
I'll take that.

350
00:52:38,516 --> 00:52:40,393
Thanks. I'm sorry, Mr. White.

351
00:52:40,477 --> 00:52:44,022
Why do I pay you $40 a week when
I should have you arrested for loitering?

352
00:52:44,105 --> 00:52:45,607
- Go get Mr... a towel.
- Kent.

353
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:47,192
- Move, kid, move.
- Right, Chief.

354
00:52:47,275 --> 00:52:49,319
- Make mine black, no sugar.
- Right, Chief.

355
00:52:49,402 --> 00:52:50,862
And don't call me sugar.

356
00:52:52,197 --> 00:52:53,948
<i>Right... Sugar.</i>

357
00:52:54,157 --> 00:52:56,826
Chief wants coffee, no sugar.
I'll take tea with lemon.

358
00:52:57,994 --> 00:53:01,331
Lois, why don't you take Kent out
to meet everybody, huh?

359
00:53:01,414 --> 00:53:04,376
Just introduce him around.
He's starting on the paper today.

360
00:53:04,501 --> 00:53:06,127
I'm giving him the City beat.

361
00:53:06,878 --> 00:53:07,671
Chief!

362
00:53:08,421 --> 00:53:09,881
That's my beat!

363
00:53:10,298 --> 00:53:13,927
Lois, Clark Kent may seem like
just a mild-mannered reporter...

364
00:53:14,135 --> 00:53:18,264
...but not only does he know how to treat
his Chief with the proper respect...

365
00:53:18,348 --> 00:53:20,975
...not only does he have a snappy,
punchy prose style...

366
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:25,063
...but he is, in my 40 years in this business,
the fastest typist I've ever seen.

367
00:53:25,146 --> 00:53:26,147
That's great.

368
00:53:26,898 --> 00:53:28,650
Here, you forgot my article.

369
00:53:32,362 --> 00:53:34,614
Excuse me, Mr. White. I was wondering...

370
00:53:34,698 --> 00:53:37,117
...if you could arrange for half my salary...

371
00:53:37,325 --> 00:53:39,744
...to be sent to this address
on a weekly basis.

372
00:53:40,203 --> 00:53:41,037
Your bookie, right?

373
00:53:41,121 --> 00:53:41,871
My what?

374
00:53:41,996 --> 00:53:42,956
Don't tell me!

375
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,000
He sends a check every week
to his sweet, gray-haired mother.

376
00:53:46,126 --> 00:53:47,794
Actually, she's silver-haired.

377
00:53:50,046 --> 00:53:51,506
I'll see what I can do.

378
00:53:52,215 --> 00:53:54,050
Thank you very much, Mr. White.

379
00:53:58,513 --> 00:53:59,222
Well?

380
00:54:01,224 --> 00:54:02,684
Any more at home like you?

381
00:54:03,476 --> 00:54:04,602
Not really, no.

382
00:54:07,731 --> 00:54:09,065
I didn't think so.

383
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,944
Well, get yourself a desk over here.

384
00:54:13,737 --> 00:54:14,696
Over here?

385
00:54:14,779 --> 00:54:17,574
Here, there's some paper
and a file right there.

386
00:54:17,741 --> 00:54:18,658
Sorry.

387
00:54:35,592 --> 00:54:38,345
- Hi, Bill Breesen.
- Hi, Clark Kent.

388
00:54:38,428 --> 00:54:40,764
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome aboard.

389
00:54:41,598 --> 00:54:44,768
- Here's your towel, Mr. Clark.
- Kent.

390
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:45,894
- What?
- Kent.

391
00:54:46,936 --> 00:54:48,855
- Clark Kent.
- Jimmy Olsen.

392
00:54:55,111 --> 00:54:58,073
- I met this really great guy, you know.
- Hey, fabulous.

393
00:54:58,156 --> 00:55:01,576
We had this fabulous weekend.
I met him at this dude ranch.

394
00:55:01,659 --> 00:55:03,286
I haven't been since I was seven.

395
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:06,206
- I got to mail these letters.
- Good luck tonight.

396
00:55:06,289 --> 00:55:07,791
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois.

397
00:55:07,874 --> 00:55:10,293
How did you like your first day on the job?

398
00:55:11,044 --> 00:55:13,588
The hours were sort of longer
than I expected...

399
00:55:13,672 --> 00:55:16,925
<i>...but on the whole, meeting you
and Jimmy Olsen and Mr. White...</i>

400
00:55:17,008 --> 00:55:19,177
Gosh, on a whole, I'd say it's been swell.

401
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,637
- "Swell"?
- Yup.

402
00:55:22,555 --> 00:55:23,723
You know, Clark...

403
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,519
...there are very few people left
in the world...

404
00:55:27,602 --> 00:55:29,646
...who feel comfortable saying that word.

405
00:55:29,729 --> 00:55:30,980
- What word?
- Swell.

406
00:55:31,064 --> 00:55:33,608
Really? I always thought
it was kind of natural.

407
00:55:35,819 --> 00:55:37,529
- Sorry.
- Clark.

408
00:55:41,282 --> 00:55:42,826
- Sorry, Lois.
- Hi, Rex.

409
00:55:43,243 --> 00:55:46,246
- Did you see anything good today?
- Not until you came along.

410
00:55:46,371 --> 00:55:47,455
<i>Rex, this is...</i>

411
00:55:47,539 --> 00:55:49,332
- Clark Kent. How do...
- See you...

412
00:55:51,793 --> 00:55:52,669
Lois?

413
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:55,005
Hey, where you going?

414
00:55:55,088 --> 00:55:56,464
Can I help you with your coat?

415
00:55:56,548 --> 00:55:58,341
- Thanks, can you get that?
- Sure.

416
00:55:58,425 --> 00:55:59,801
Did you like Mr. White?

417
00:55:59,884 --> 00:56:02,178
He was a nice guy
and Jimmy was fantastic.

418
00:56:03,013 --> 00:56:04,764
Come here. Come on.

419
00:56:04,848 --> 00:56:06,433
Get in here, hurry up. Come on.

420
00:56:06,516 --> 00:56:07,851
We'd better get out of here.

421
00:56:07,934 --> 00:56:09,728
We'd better do what he says, Lois.

422
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,521
Come on, get in here, quick.

423
00:56:11,604 --> 00:56:14,524
Don't, don't do anything.
It's all right, I'm coming.

424
00:56:14,607 --> 00:56:15,859
We're coming.

425
00:56:16,026 --> 00:56:17,068
Excuse me.

426
00:56:17,444 --> 00:56:18,528
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah.

427
00:56:18,611 --> 00:56:21,698
Don't point that at me, sir.
You could hurt somebody with that.

428
00:56:22,949 --> 00:56:24,534
Okay, okay. Hold it there.

429
00:56:24,784 --> 00:56:25,785
Just a minute.

430
00:56:26,036 --> 00:56:27,287
Now I realize that...

431
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:30,665
...times are tough for some these days,
but this isn't the answer.

432
00:56:30,749 --> 00:56:34,127
You can't solve society's problems
with a gun.

433
00:56:35,211 --> 00:56:36,880
You know, buddy, you're right.

434
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:40,717
- I'm going to turn over a new leaf.
- Good for you. That's the spirit.

435
00:56:40,842 --> 00:56:42,886
He doesn't really want to hurt anyone.

436
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,889
Right after I rip off this lady's purse.

437
00:56:45,972 --> 00:56:46,890
Of course!

438
00:56:47,223 --> 00:56:48,975
Now come on, lady, hand it over.

439
00:56:49,351 --> 00:56:51,269
<i>Lois, I think you'd better...</i>

440
00:56:55,732 --> 00:56:57,359
Lois! What are you doing?

441
00:57:15,752 --> 00:57:17,128
Are you all right?

442
00:57:18,171 --> 00:57:19,255
What happened?

443
00:57:20,173 --> 00:57:23,385
- Golly, I guess I must have fainted.
- Fainted?

444
00:57:24,511 --> 00:57:26,262
- You fainted!
- I'm sorry.

445
00:57:40,235 --> 00:57:42,696
Really, Lois,
supposing that man had shot you?

446
00:57:42,779 --> 00:57:44,823
Is it worth risking your life over $10...

447
00:57:44,906 --> 00:57:47,325
...two credit cards,
a hairbrush and a lipstick?

448
00:57:48,118 --> 00:57:49,911
- How did you know that?
- Know what?

449
00:57:51,663 --> 00:57:53,998
You described the exact contents
of my purse.

450
00:57:58,378 --> 00:57:59,295
Wild guess.

451
00:58:03,216 --> 00:58:04,050
Taxi!

452
00:58:08,972 --> 00:58:10,306
- Hey!
- Hi, Otis.

453
00:58:21,735 --> 00:58:23,403
So, what's happening, partner?

454
00:58:23,611 --> 00:58:24,821
Look what we got.

455
00:58:25,363 --> 00:58:26,448
Let's take him.

456
00:58:26,656 --> 00:58:28,074
Wait a minute.

457
00:58:28,158 --> 00:58:30,452
Maybe he'll lead us to the big man himself.

458
00:58:30,827 --> 00:58:31,828
Lex Luthor?

459
00:58:32,162 --> 00:58:33,455
You got it, Aramus.

460
00:58:34,706 --> 00:58:36,499
We'll make Captain by midnight.

461
00:58:38,585 --> 00:58:42,339
Hey, what do you read?
XK-101 rocket to be used.

462
00:58:43,256 --> 00:58:44,716
Hey, what do you read?

463
00:58:45,091 --> 00:58:46,801
- Hey, Matt.
- Hi, Otis.

464
00:58:46,885 --> 00:58:48,803
<i>Just getting a Daily Planet here.</i>

465
00:58:54,851 --> 00:58:56,269
Okay. All right.

466
00:58:56,811 --> 00:58:59,105
See, I'm paying him,
and I got a pretzel, too.

467
00:58:59,189 --> 00:59:00,315
Thanks, Otis.

468
00:59:01,149 --> 00:59:02,442
How many bags, Shutzy?

469
00:59:05,445 --> 00:59:08,156
This is Metropolis 46. We're on foot.
Over and out.

470
00:59:08,281 --> 00:59:09,199
Let's go.

471
00:59:14,287 --> 00:59:18,500
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

472
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:21,878
<i>The Metropolis Flyer is now ready
for departure...</i>

473
00:59:22,212 --> 00:59:24,881
<i>...on the upper level. Track 6.</i>

474
00:59:26,758 --> 00:59:29,928
He's going down on a train platform.
I'm going after him.

475
00:59:30,011 --> 00:59:32,639
Okay, I'll call for backup.
Be careful now, will you?

476
00:59:32,722 --> 00:59:34,391
All right, Aramus. All right.

477
00:59:36,518 --> 00:59:38,728
<i>Now boarding on the lower level...</i>

478
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:44,025
<i>Now 10 minutes, air-conditioned cars,
Mount Vernon, Poughkeepsie...</i>

479
00:59:44,359 --> 00:59:45,902
Board now. All aboard.

480
00:59:46,194 --> 00:59:49,739
<i>Metropolis Transportation
to Buffalo, Syracuse...</i>

481
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:53,326
Smoking cars are forward,
move along now.

482
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:55,203
Luggage at the top.

483
00:59:55,704 --> 00:59:58,707
Smoking cars are forward.
All aboard, boarding.

484
01:00:26,609 --> 01:00:29,029
Aramus, Aramus, make it Track 22.

485
01:00:29,446 --> 01:00:32,741
I've seen him and I'm right on him.
Lower level, Track 22.

486
01:01:09,819 --> 01:01:11,112
So that's it!

487
01:01:27,337 --> 01:01:31,174
It's amazing that brain can generate
enough power to keep those legs moving.

488
01:02:13,174 --> 01:02:14,009
<i>Harry...</i>

489
01:02:16,553 --> 01:02:18,722
Harry, where are you? Harry?

490
01:02:39,117 --> 01:02:39,868
Sick!

491
01:02:49,085 --> 01:02:50,712
Sick, you're really sick!

492
01:02:51,588 --> 01:02:53,131
I'm sick, Ms. Teschmacher?

493
01:02:53,256 --> 01:02:56,301
Sick when we're days
from executing the crime of the century?

494
01:02:56,384 --> 01:02:58,511
No. Step away from that, please.

495
01:03:00,764 --> 01:03:04,434
How do you choose to congratulate
the greatest criminal mind of our time?

496
01:03:04,934 --> 01:03:06,686
Do you tell me that I'm brilliant?

497
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:09,814
Oh, no, that would be too obvious,
I grant you.

498
01:03:10,065 --> 01:03:11,024
Charismatic?

499
01:03:11,608 --> 01:03:12,942
Fiendishly gifted?

500
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:15,612
Try twisted!

501
01:03:21,409 --> 01:03:23,495
Get away from that, get away!

502
01:03:25,622 --> 01:03:27,082
Tell me, Lex.

503
01:03:27,248 --> 01:03:30,251
Why do so many people have to die
for the crime of the century?

504
01:03:30,335 --> 01:03:31,628
Why? You ask why?

505
01:03:32,295 --> 01:03:35,256
Why does the phone always ring
when you're in the bathtub?

506
01:03:36,591 --> 01:03:39,886
Why is the most brilliantly diabolical leader
of our time...

507
01:03:40,595 --> 01:03:42,889
...surrounding himself
with total nincompoops?

508
01:03:42,972 --> 01:03:44,265
I'm back, Mr. Luthor.

509
01:03:44,974 --> 01:03:46,935
I was just talking about you.

510
01:03:47,977 --> 01:03:49,437
You were followed again.

511
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,819
In spite of those cat-like reflexes.

512
01:04:00,824 --> 01:04:02,617
Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry.

513
01:04:05,245 --> 01:04:07,497
Is that the newspaper
I asked you to get me?

514
01:04:08,248 --> 01:04:09,165
Yes.

515
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:11,751
Then why am I not reading it?

516
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:15,672
Because I haven't given it to you yet?

517
01:04:15,964 --> 01:04:16,756
Right.

518
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:23,304
At last it's official.

519
01:04:24,347 --> 01:04:26,474
Thanks to the help of the US Government...

520
01:04:26,558 --> 01:04:30,437
...we are about to be involved in
the greatest real-estate swindle of all time.

521
01:04:30,687 --> 01:04:32,022
Lex, what is this...

522
01:04:32,188 --> 01:04:35,400
...obsession with real estate?
All the time, "land, land, land."

523
01:04:35,525 --> 01:04:38,361
When I was 6 years old,
my father said to me...

524
01:04:38,528 --> 01:04:39,362
"Get out! "

525
01:04:41,197 --> 01:04:44,784
Before that, he said,
"Son, stocks may rise and fall...

526
01:04:44,868 --> 01:04:47,704
<i>"... utilities and transportation systems
may collapse...</i>

527
01:04:47,787 --> 01:04:50,874
<i>"... people are no damn good,
but they'll always need land...</i>

528
01:04:50,957 --> 01:04:53,293
<i>"... they'll pay through the nose to get it."</i>

529
01:04:53,376 --> 01:04:55,587
- "Remember," my father said...
- "Land."

530
01:04:58,882 --> 01:05:01,259
It's a pity that he didn't see...

531
01:05:01,343 --> 01:05:04,262
...from such humble beginnings
how I've created this empire.

532
01:05:04,346 --> 01:05:05,638
An empire. This?

533
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:11,561
How many girls do you know
have a Park Avenue address like this?

534
01:05:12,228 --> 01:05:15,398
Park Avenue address, 200 feet below?

535
01:05:15,732 --> 01:05:18,443
Do you realize
what people are shelling out up there...

536
01:05:18,651 --> 01:05:21,237
...for a few miserable rooms
off a common elevator.

537
01:05:21,821 --> 01:05:23,740
What more could anyone ask?

538
01:05:31,873 --> 01:05:34,834
Get this Loch Ness update
right into composing.

539
01:05:35,251 --> 01:05:38,380
Yeah, no that's it, Roth.
Put it to bed, right.

540
01:05:39,172 --> 01:05:40,590
Why are you standing here for?

541
01:05:40,674 --> 01:05:41,466
I'm not.

542
01:05:42,342 --> 01:05:44,052
- I wasn't going to say it.
- Go.

543
01:05:49,099 --> 01:05:51,059
The sex maniac profile.

544
01:05:51,267 --> 01:05:54,521
Right. Nine to five it's
a Pulitzer Prize winner. What do you bet?

545
01:05:54,604 --> 01:05:56,314
There's no "Z" in "brassiere."

546
01:05:56,439 --> 01:05:58,733
Nice job on that union scandal, Kent.

547
01:05:59,025 --> 01:06:00,443
Gosh, thanks, Mr. White.

548
01:06:05,198 --> 01:06:06,533
Hi, Clark. Good night.

549
01:06:06,616 --> 01:06:09,411
- Here, let me carry that for you.
- Thanks a lot.

550
01:06:09,619 --> 01:06:11,579
Lois, have you got a minute?

551
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,289
Excuse me, please.

552
01:06:14,457 --> 01:06:17,836
And these two go to the addresses
on the envelope, okay?

553
01:06:18,712 --> 01:06:20,964
I was wondering
if you'd have dinner with me?

554
01:06:21,047 --> 01:06:22,966
I'm sorry, I'm booked.

555
01:06:23,717 --> 01:06:27,512
Air Force One is landing at the airport.
This kid'll be there to make sure...

556
01:06:27,595 --> 01:06:30,640
...you-know-who answers the questions
he would rather duck.

557
01:06:30,724 --> 01:06:32,100
Don't you ever let up?

558
01:06:32,308 --> 01:06:35,228
What for? I mean I've seen
how the other half lives.

559
01:06:35,311 --> 01:06:39,149
My sister, for instance.
Three kids, two cats, and one mortgage.

560
01:06:39,733 --> 01:06:41,568
I would go bananas in a week.

561
01:06:41,693 --> 01:06:44,487
- Can I take you to the airport?
- Not unless you can fly.

562
01:06:47,782 --> 01:06:50,535
"Ladies." I have to change, thank you.
Goodbye.

563
01:06:50,618 --> 01:06:51,828
Maybe we could...

564
01:06:59,461 --> 01:07:02,339
- Would you mail that for me? Thanks.
- Sure.

565
01:07:02,589 --> 01:07:03,590
Good night.

566
01:07:09,262 --> 01:07:11,598
Going down, please, going down.

567
01:07:14,976 --> 01:07:15,935
Going down?

568
01:07:16,019 --> 01:07:17,187
Going up. Up, up.

569
01:07:19,439 --> 01:07:20,440
Good night.

570
01:07:32,577 --> 01:07:34,704
<i>Daily Planet, Copter One. This is ground.</i>

571
01:07:34,788 --> 01:07:36,164
<i>Planet One, go ahead.</i>

572
01:07:36,373 --> 01:07:40,794
<i>Miss Lane is here for a ride to the airport
to meet Air Force One. It's a hurry flight.</i>

573
01:07:41,127 --> 01:07:45,215
<i>We're on our way over the river.
Have one aboard for transfer. Over.</i>

574
01:07:45,548 --> 01:07:50,345
<i>Roger, Planet One. You're clear to land.
Wind 0-2-0-1-5. Altimeter 2-9-8-9.</i>

575
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,013
<i>Roger, Over and out.</i>

576
01:08:53,283 --> 01:08:54,868
A malfunction, can't get lift off.

577
01:08:54,951 --> 01:08:57,412
<i>- You've hooked a cable.
- What's happening?</i>

578
01:08:58,955 --> 01:08:59,998
<i>Set it down.</i>

579
01:09:00,081 --> 01:09:01,875
My God, we've lost motor control.

580
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:03,043
I can't hold it.

581
01:09:08,965 --> 01:09:10,592
I can't hold it.

582
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:13,303
He's lost it.

583
01:09:27,984 --> 01:09:28,902
Wake up.

584
01:09:32,072 --> 01:09:33,698
Help!

585
01:09:52,342 --> 01:09:53,635
Step back, folks.

586
01:09:54,344 --> 01:09:57,013
Get back. Move over
to the other side of the street.

587
01:09:59,891 --> 01:10:02,727
Bring the canvas here. Get it up there.

588
01:10:02,977 --> 01:10:04,562
There's a helicopter up there.

589
01:10:10,902 --> 01:10:11,986
Help me.

590
01:10:20,829 --> 01:10:23,206
All right, folks. Let's move back.

591
01:10:24,165 --> 01:10:25,834
Let these firemen get in here.

592
01:10:28,628 --> 01:10:29,421
Help me!

593
01:10:35,677 --> 01:10:36,970
Hold it. Get back.

594
01:10:41,057 --> 01:10:43,059
Get off the street, folks.

595
01:10:57,574 --> 01:11:00,869
All right, get along there.
Get away from the side of the building.

596
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,749
Hold these crowds back. Move.

597
01:11:08,251 --> 01:11:09,085
Help!

598
01:11:25,727 --> 01:11:26,686
<i>Say, Jim...</i>

599
01:11:27,354 --> 01:11:28,188
Excuse me.

600
01:11:28,271 --> 01:11:29,731
That's a bad outfit.

601
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:32,901
Okay, move these people.

602
01:11:42,744 --> 01:11:44,245
My God! Look up there.

603
01:11:46,206 --> 01:11:47,540
What the hell's that?

604
01:11:49,626 --> 01:11:51,127
Easy, miss. I've got you.

605
01:11:51,252 --> 01:11:54,214
You've got me? Who's got you?

606
01:11:55,965 --> 01:11:59,969
I can't believe it, I just cannot believe it.
He got her.

607
01:12:44,764 --> 01:12:46,808
Gentlemen, this man needs help.

608
01:12:48,768 --> 01:12:51,813
I hope this little incident
hasn't put you off flying, miss.

609
01:12:53,523 --> 01:12:57,027
Statistically speaking, of course,
it's still the safest way to travel.

610
01:12:58,194 --> 01:12:58,987
Right.

611
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:01,031
Wait!

612
01:13:05,702 --> 01:13:06,870
Who are you?

613
01:13:07,787 --> 01:13:08,747
A friend.

614
01:13:14,085 --> 01:13:15,086
'Bye.

615
01:14:28,618 --> 01:14:30,453
Something wrong with the elevator?

616
01:14:37,919 --> 01:14:38,837
Going down?

617
01:14:51,641 --> 01:14:52,517
Officer.

618
01:14:55,937 --> 01:14:58,273
Good evening, Officer Mooney.

619
01:14:58,982 --> 01:15:01,192
They say confession is good for the soul.

620
01:15:02,986 --> 01:15:05,989
I'd listen to this man. Take him away.

621
01:15:52,035 --> 01:15:53,745
Come on, let's get out of here.

622
01:16:04,255 --> 01:16:05,715
Move your ass! Come on!

623
01:16:06,549 --> 01:16:08,176
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

624
01:16:08,885 --> 01:16:11,680
Drop your weapons. Drop your weapons.

625
01:16:11,888 --> 01:16:14,557
Bullshit! Come on, let's get out of here.

626
01:16:14,724 --> 01:16:16,726
Okay, hold it. Hold it right there.

627
01:16:17,018 --> 01:16:18,353
Okay, freeze, you turkeys.

628
01:16:18,436 --> 01:16:20,689
- Don't shoot!
- Keep your cool. You got us.

629
01:16:45,296 --> 01:16:46,423
Bad vibrations?

630
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:50,260
Sergeant, you don't believe me.
I swear it, flying.

631
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:53,263
With a big red cape
and bright red boots as well.

632
01:16:53,722 --> 01:16:58,184
Quick as a wink he was gone. He flew up
in the air again, he did, like a big blue bird.

633
01:16:58,351 --> 01:17:00,228
- A big blue bird?
- You don't believe me!

634
01:17:00,311 --> 01:17:01,730
With bright red boots?

635
01:17:01,938 --> 01:17:03,148
Take the night off.

636
01:17:03,231 --> 01:17:05,942
Go back to Murphy's bar
and continue what you started.

637
01:17:06,109 --> 01:17:09,070
I'll be off in a few minutes
and I'll meet you there.

638
01:17:20,206 --> 01:17:22,625
The first bottle's on me.
Let me get my hat.

639
01:17:33,762 --> 01:17:35,972
Frisky, will you come down from there.

640
01:17:38,266 --> 01:17:39,726
Hi. I'll get him.

641
01:17:44,773 --> 01:17:46,358
Come on, it's all right.

642
01:17:47,984 --> 01:17:50,820
- Here you go, miss.
- Gee, thanks, mister.

643
01:17:53,448 --> 01:17:55,492
Goodbye, Frisky. So long now.

644
01:17:59,162 --> 01:17:59,954
'Bye.

645
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:06,127
Mommy, Mommy,
Frisky was stuck in the tree.

646
01:18:06,336 --> 01:18:09,130
Then this man swooped out of the sky
and gave him to me.

647
01:18:09,381 --> 01:18:12,175
Haven't I told you to stop telling lies.

648
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:21,226
Metropolis Airport, this is Air Force One.
Could we have the latest weather report?

649
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:25,271
<i>Metropolis currently ceiling 500,
overcast 700 broken...</i>

650
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:29,609
<i>...visibility one half in showers.
Wind 2-4-0-2-5. Altimeter 9-0-9-8.</i>

651
01:18:29,818 --> 01:18:30,610
Roger.

652
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:34,114
Doesn't look good. What do you think?

653
01:18:35,699 --> 01:18:39,035
- What the hell was that?
- You've lost power in number one.

654
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,329
Lost power? We've lost the whole engine.

655
01:18:41,705 --> 01:18:43,790
- Pressure's going.
- Shut down number one.

656
01:18:43,873 --> 01:18:44,958
Bring up two and three.

657
01:18:45,041 --> 01:18:47,335
We haven't got enough pressure
to keep going.

658
01:18:48,878 --> 01:18:52,215
Mayday, mayday. Metropolis tower.
Air Force One.

659
01:18:52,507 --> 01:18:55,468
We have lost port outboard engine
and part of wing.

660
01:18:55,719 --> 01:18:58,555
Request emergency landing.
What's the position?

661
01:18:58,722 --> 01:19:00,849
Ten miles southwest of Metropolis Airport.

662
01:19:00,932 --> 01:19:02,475
Notify them the President's on board.

663
01:19:02,559 --> 01:19:06,438
Present position 10 miles, that's 10 miles
southwest of Metropolis Airport.

664
01:19:06,521 --> 01:19:09,941
Heading: 3-0-5, height: 6,000 feet.

665
01:19:29,544 --> 01:19:31,963
What the hell happened?
We got our engine back?

666
01:19:32,339 --> 01:19:34,257
What the hell's going on out there?

667
01:19:34,466 --> 01:19:37,594
Fly, don't look, just fly.

668
01:19:37,969 --> 01:19:39,512
We got something.

669
01:19:40,263 --> 01:19:43,516
I'm not saying what it is, just trust me.

670
01:19:56,029 --> 01:19:57,864
<i>You enjoyed it.</i>

671
01:20:01,618 --> 01:20:03,495
I don't know what to say, Father.

672
01:20:03,787 --> 01:20:05,622
I'm afraid I just got carried away.

673
01:20:06,706 --> 01:20:09,459
<i>- I anticipated this, my son.
- You couldn't have.</i>

674
01:20:10,669 --> 01:20:12,337
<i>You couldn't have imagined...</i>

675
01:20:13,755 --> 01:20:15,006
<i>How good it felt?</i>

676
01:20:17,801 --> 01:20:19,469
<i>You are revealed to the world.</i>

677
01:20:21,638 --> 01:20:22,639
<i>Very well.</i>

678
01:20:23,473 --> 01:20:24,432
<i>So be it.</i>

679
01:20:25,642 --> 01:20:28,269
<i>But you still must keep
your secret identity.</i>

680
01:20:28,937 --> 01:20:29,938
Why?

681
01:20:30,605 --> 01:20:31,856
<i>The reasons are two.</i>

682
01:20:32,816 --> 01:20:35,735
<i>First: You cannot serve humanity
28 hours a day.</i>

683
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,863
24.

684
01:20:40,281 --> 01:20:41,741
<i>As it is, in earth time.</i>

685
01:20:43,576 --> 01:20:46,121
<i>Your help will be called for endlessly.</i>

686
01:20:46,204 --> 01:20:49,624
<i>Even for those tasks that human beings
can solve themselves.</i>

687
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:53,712
<i>It's their habit to abuse their resources
in such a way.</i>

688
01:20:54,254 --> 01:20:55,296
And secondly?

689
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:56,381
<i>Secondly:</i>

690
01:20:56,798 --> 01:20:58,425
<i>Your enemies will discover...</i>

691
01:20:59,551 --> 01:21:01,344
<i>...their only way to hurt you...</i>

692
01:21:01,761 --> 01:21:03,763
<i>...by hurting the people you care for.</i>

693
01:21:05,306 --> 01:21:06,558
Thank you, Father.

694
01:21:06,725 --> 01:21:07,726
<i>Lastly:</i>

695
01:21:10,437 --> 01:21:13,106
<i>Do not punish yourself
with your feelings of vanity.</i>

696
01:21:13,690 --> 01:21:15,358
<i>Simply learn to control them.</i>

697
01:21:15,859 --> 01:21:18,695
<i>It is an affliction common to all,
even on Krypton.</i>

698
01:21:19,696 --> 01:21:23,033
<i>Our destruction could have been avoided
but for the vanity of some...</i>

699
01:21:23,116 --> 01:21:25,618
<i>...who considered us indestructible.</i>

700
01:21:26,578 --> 01:21:28,079
<i>Were it not for vanity...</i>

701
01:21:29,873 --> 01:21:31,583
<i>...at this very moment...</i>

702
01:21:35,754 --> 01:21:38,006
<i>...I could embrace you in my arms...</i>

703
01:21:42,677 --> 01:21:43,595
<i>...my son.</i>

704
01:22:14,834 --> 01:22:18,088
<i>Reports are coming in
of a miraculous saving of Air Force One...</i>

705
01:22:18,463 --> 01:22:20,924
<i>...from almost certain destruction...</i>

706
01:22:21,341 --> 01:22:25,470
<i>...rescuing Miss Lois Lane, reporter
from the Daily Planet, with one hand...</i>

707
01:22:26,763 --> 01:22:28,515
<i>...and a crashed helicopter with the other.</i>

708
01:22:31,768 --> 01:22:33,353
That'll be the day.

709
01:22:35,021 --> 01:22:37,190
That'll be the day when a guy could fly.

710
01:22:38,024 --> 01:22:39,317
I don't know. You would be surprised.

711
01:22:42,696 --> 01:22:44,364
<i>...some sort of fantastic hoax.</i>

712
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,701
<i>Your guess is as good as anybody's.
True or false?</i>

713
01:22:47,784 --> 01:22:49,869
<i>Miracle or fraud? The answer...</i>

714
01:22:49,995 --> 01:22:51,663
<i>- Miss Teschmacher!
- Man or myth?</i>

715
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:53,456
Turn it off.

716
01:23:02,841 --> 01:23:06,636
What's the story on this guy?
Do you think it's the genuine article?

717
01:23:06,803 --> 01:23:08,638
If he is, he's not from this world.

718
01:23:09,347 --> 01:23:10,306
Why?

719
01:23:10,682 --> 01:23:14,477
If any human being was gonna perpetrate
such a hoax, it would have been me!

720
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:27,574
My robe.

721
01:23:29,701 --> 01:23:31,328
Right away, Mr. Luthor.

722
01:23:32,454 --> 01:23:35,290
It all fits somehow,
this coming here to Metropolis...

723
01:23:36,666 --> 01:23:38,501
...and at this particular time.

724
01:23:42,422 --> 01:23:44,799
There's a kind of cruel justice about it.

725
01:23:45,175 --> 01:23:49,429
To commit the crime of the century, a man
wants to face the challenge of the century.

726
01:23:52,223 --> 01:23:56,811
Listen, maybe this guy that flies
is just sort of passing through.

727
01:23:57,228 --> 01:23:58,355
Passing through?

728
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:00,690
Not on your life, Otis...

729
01:24:01,191 --> 01:24:03,568
...which I would gladly sacrifice
by the way...

730
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:07,614
...for the opportunity of destroying
everything that he represents.

731
01:24:09,032 --> 01:24:13,870
And, Otis, by the way, next time
put my robe on after I'm out of the pool.

732
01:24:16,164 --> 01:24:17,207
Now look.

733
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:18,750
<i>The Post, "It Flies."</i>

734
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:21,044
<i>The News, "Look, Ma, No Wires."</i>

735
01:24:21,252 --> 01:24:23,380
<i>The Times,
"Blue Bomb Buzzes Metropolis."</i>

736
01:24:23,713 --> 01:24:27,300
<i>The Planet. We're sitting on top
of the story of the century here.</i>

737
01:24:27,717 --> 01:24:29,928
I want the name
of this flying whatchamacallit...

738
01:24:30,011 --> 01:24:32,138
<i>...to go with the Daily Planet
like bacon and eggs...</i>

739
01:24:32,222 --> 01:24:35,308
...franks and beans, death and taxes,
politics and corruption.

740
01:24:35,558 --> 01:24:36,768
I don't think that he'd...

741
01:24:36,851 --> 01:24:39,646
...lend himself
to any cheap promotion schemes.

742
01:24:39,896 --> 01:24:41,564
Exactly how would you know that?

743
01:24:44,359 --> 01:24:45,985
Just first impression.

744
01:24:46,069 --> 01:24:48,738
Who's talking cheap?
I'll make him a partner if I have to.

745
01:24:48,822 --> 01:24:50,115
- Right?
- Right, Chief.

746
01:24:52,367 --> 01:24:53,702
I want the real story.

747
01:24:53,827 --> 01:24:55,787
I want the inside dope on this guy.

748
01:24:56,413 --> 01:24:59,958
Has he got a family? Where does he live?
What does the "S" stand for?

749
01:25:08,925 --> 01:25:11,177
Tony, who is he? Mike, what's his name?

750
01:25:11,344 --> 01:25:13,847
What's he got hidden under that cape?
Batteries?

751
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:15,765
Why did he show up last night?

752
01:25:16,266 --> 01:25:17,767
Where does he come from?

753
01:25:18,143 --> 01:25:19,602
Does he have a girlfriend?

754
01:25:21,604 --> 01:25:23,356
What's his favorite ball team, Kent?

755
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,067
Now listen to me, I tell you,
boys and girls...

756
01:25:26,651 --> 01:25:28,570
...whichever one of you gets it out of him...

757
01:25:28,653 --> 01:25:32,198
...is going to wind up with the single,
most important interview since...

758
01:25:33,283 --> 01:25:34,701
...God talked to Moses!

759
01:25:38,371 --> 01:25:41,166
What are you standing around about for?
Move!

760
01:25:41,875 --> 01:25:43,251
Get on that story.

761
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:05,148
"8:00," he said. Some friend!

762
01:26:06,649 --> 01:26:09,527
That's the story of my life,
"Cinderella Bites The Dust! "

763
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:23,833
Good evening, Miss Lane.

764
01:26:28,338 --> 01:26:30,215
Did you have plans this evening?

765
01:26:31,675 --> 01:26:32,967
This old thing? No.

766
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:35,428
- I could come back later.
- No!

767
01:26:35,637 --> 01:26:36,513
Don't move.

768
01:26:40,225 --> 01:26:41,601
Sure you can move.

769
01:26:42,769 --> 01:26:44,437
Just don't fly away, all right?

770
01:26:45,522 --> 01:26:48,483
Sorry to drop in on you like this,
but I've been thinking.

771
01:26:48,775 --> 01:26:52,278
There must be some questions
people'd like to know the answers to.

772
01:26:52,362 --> 01:26:53,363
Yes.

773
01:26:59,285 --> 01:27:00,954
You really shouldn't smoke.

774
01:27:02,789 --> 01:27:04,666
Don't tell me. Lung cancer, right?

775
01:27:07,502 --> 01:27:09,254
Well, not yet, thank goodness.

776
01:27:12,841 --> 01:27:14,426
Would you like a glass of wine?

777
01:27:14,509 --> 01:27:16,511
No, thanks. I never drink when I fly.

778
01:27:18,054 --> 01:27:19,139
Nice place.

779
01:27:19,556 --> 01:27:20,765
Thank you.

780
01:27:21,224 --> 01:27:22,392
Thank you.

781
01:27:22,934 --> 01:27:25,186
Shall we get started with the interview?

782
01:27:32,110 --> 01:27:34,863
Let's start with your vital statistics.
Are you married?

783
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,532
No, I'm not.

784
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:40,035
Do you have a girlfriend?

785
01:27:40,118 --> 01:27:41,411
<i>No, I don't. But...</i>

786
01:27:42,203 --> 01:27:44,539
If I did, you'd be the first to know about it.

787
01:27:50,795 --> 01:27:51,838
How old are you?

788
01:27:52,339 --> 01:27:53,256
Over 21.

789
01:27:53,965 --> 01:27:56,176
I get it. You don't want anyone to know.

790
01:27:56,885 --> 01:27:59,262
And how big are you? How tall are you?

791
01:27:59,596 --> 01:28:00,680
<i>About 6' 4".</i>

792
01:28:00,930 --> 01:28:04,017
<i>6' 4". And how much do you weigh?</i>

793
01:28:04,309 --> 01:28:06,019
Around 225.

794
01:28:06,811 --> 01:28:08,688
225?

795
01:28:15,737 --> 01:28:17,447
I assume then that...

796
01:28:18,907 --> 01:28:22,619
...the rest of your bodily functions
are normal?

797
01:28:23,703 --> 01:28:24,871
I beg your pardon?

798
01:28:26,039 --> 01:28:27,874
Well, putting it delicately...

799
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:33,546
...do you...

800
01:28:36,675 --> 01:28:37,467
...eat?

801
01:28:38,468 --> 01:28:41,262
Yes, I do, when I'm hungry.

802
01:28:42,097 --> 01:28:44,641
You do. Of course, you do.

803
01:28:45,517 --> 01:28:47,977
Well, then is it true...

804
01:28:48,687 --> 01:28:52,732
...that you can see through anything?

805
01:28:52,982 --> 01:28:54,734
Yes, I can, pretty much.

806
01:28:55,694 --> 01:28:59,114
And that you're totally impervious to pain?

807
01:28:59,447 --> 01:29:00,490
Well, so far.

808
01:29:02,283 --> 01:29:04,119
What color underwear am I wearing?

809
01:29:08,707 --> 01:29:10,000
Did I embarrass you?

810
01:29:10,166 --> 01:29:11,543
- No.
- I did.

811
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,629
No, it's just that
this planter must be made of lead.

812
01:29:15,755 --> 01:29:16,923
Yes, it is. So?

813
01:29:17,007 --> 01:29:20,593
I sort of have a problem
seeing through lead.

814
01:29:21,344 --> 01:29:22,554
That's interesting.

815
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:24,681
Problems with lead.

816
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:29,185
- Do you have a first name?
- Like Ralph, or something?

817
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:30,729
- No, I mean like...
- Pink.

818
01:29:32,272 --> 01:29:33,064
Pink!

819
01:29:36,276 --> 01:29:38,319
Sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you.

820
01:29:39,988 --> 01:29:41,364
You didn't embarrass me.

821
01:29:43,491 --> 01:29:45,744
What's your background?
Where are you from?

822
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,205
It's kind of hard to explain, actually.

823
01:29:49,414 --> 01:29:52,584
<i>You see, I'm from...
Well, from pretty far away.</i>

824
01:29:53,209 --> 01:29:56,880
Another galaxy, as a matter of fact.
I come from a planet called Krypton.

825
01:29:58,006 --> 01:29:59,049
Krypton.

826
01:30:00,467 --> 01:30:03,762
<i>Cripton! With a C-r-i...</i>

827
01:30:05,013 --> 01:30:08,308
No, actually it's Krypton,
with a K-r-y-p-t-o-n.

828
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:13,813
Do you like pink?

829
01:30:19,027 --> 01:30:20,528
I like pink very much.

830
01:30:25,158 --> 01:30:26,159
Why are you?

831
01:30:26,743 --> 01:30:27,577
Sorry?

832
01:30:28,286 --> 01:30:31,831
I mean, why are you here?
There must be a reason for you to be here.

833
01:30:32,207 --> 01:30:35,627
Yes, I'm here to fight for truth and justice
and the American way.

834
01:30:37,087 --> 01:30:39,798
You'll end up fighting every official
in this country.

835
01:30:40,423 --> 01:30:42,133
You don't really mean that.

836
01:30:42,425 --> 01:30:44,010
- I don't believe this.
- Lois?

837
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:46,262
I never lie.

838
01:30:55,355 --> 01:30:57,357
How fast do you fly, by the way?

839
01:30:57,899 --> 01:31:01,403
I don't know. I've never actually bothered
to time myself.

840
01:31:02,445 --> 01:31:03,113
Say?

841
01:31:04,864 --> 01:31:06,199
Why don't we find out?

842
01:31:06,783 --> 01:31:08,660
And how do you propose we do that?

843
01:31:09,369 --> 01:31:12,539
- Take a ride with me.
- You mean I could fly?

844
01:31:12,622 --> 01:31:15,125
I'd be handling the flying, if that's okay.

845
01:31:15,208 --> 01:31:18,420
- This is utterly fantastic.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

846
01:31:18,753 --> 01:31:20,630
- Are you serious?
- Sure.

847
01:31:21,339 --> 01:31:22,674
Don't you want to go?

848
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:25,635
You won't need these.

849
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:29,347
<i>- I need a sweater. It must be kind of...
- No, you'll be warm enough.</i>

850
01:31:35,895 --> 01:31:36,730
Ready?

851
01:31:37,105 --> 01:31:41,693
Clark said that you were just a figment
of somebody's imagination.

852
01:31:42,861 --> 01:31:43,987
Like Peter Pan.

853
01:31:44,612 --> 01:31:47,115
Clark, who's that? Your boyfriend?

854
01:31:47,449 --> 01:31:50,869
- Clark? No, he's nothing.
- Peter Pan?

855
01:31:53,371 --> 01:31:56,750
Peter Pan flew with children, Lois.
In a fairy tale.

856
01:35:13,697 --> 01:35:15,115
<i>Can you read my mind?</i>

857
01:35:20,787 --> 01:35:22,998
<i>Do you know what it is that you do to me?</i>

858
01:35:26,376 --> 01:35:27,877
<i>I don't know who you are.</i>

859
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,011
<i>Just a friend from another star.</i>

860
01:35:40,432 --> 01:35:42,642
<i>Here I am, like a kid out of school.</i>

861
01:35:44,602 --> 01:35:46,229
<i>Holding hands with a god.</i>

862
01:35:48,273 --> 01:35:49,274
<i>I'm a fool.</i>

863
01:35:51,401 --> 01:35:52,652
<i>Will you look at me?</i>

864
01:35:53,278 --> 01:35:54,195
<i>Quivering.</i>

865
01:35:55,322 --> 01:35:57,157
<i>Like a little girl shivering.</i>

866
01:35:58,575 --> 01:36:00,452
<i>You can see right through me.</i>

867
01:36:05,749 --> 01:36:07,292
<i>Can you read my mind?</i>

868
01:36:11,129 --> 01:36:13,423
<i>Can you picture the things I'm thinking of?</i>

869
01:36:18,261 --> 01:36:20,096
<i>Wondering why you are...</i>

870
01:36:21,973 --> 01:36:24,601
<i>...all the wonderful things you are.</i>

871
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,730
<i>You can fly.</i>

872
01:36:30,315 --> 01:36:31,858
<i>You belong in the sky.</i>

873
01:36:34,152 --> 01:36:35,111
<i>You and I...</i>

874
01:36:37,113 --> 01:36:38,782
<i>...could belong to each other.</i>

875
01:36:42,285 --> 01:36:43,703
<i>If you need a friend...</i>

876
01:36:47,332 --> 01:36:49,250
<i>...I'm the one to fly to.</i>

877
01:36:53,838 --> 01:36:55,632
<i>If you need to be loved...</i>

878
01:36:57,634 --> 01:36:58,635
<i>...here I am.</i>

879
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:01,721
<i>Read my mind.</i>

880
01:37:24,077 --> 01:37:25,704
We forgot to time ourselves.

881
01:37:28,206 --> 01:37:29,457
Maybe next time.

882
01:37:39,092 --> 01:37:39,968
You okay?

883
01:37:44,014 --> 01:37:44,931
Good night.

884
01:37:46,349 --> 01:37:47,267
Good night.

885
01:37:53,023 --> 01:37:54,149
What a super man!

886
01:38:00,739 --> 01:38:02,032
Superman!

887
01:38:07,454 --> 01:38:08,496
Anybody home?

888
01:38:17,505 --> 01:38:19,382
- Hi. Can I come in?
- Oh, yeah.

889
01:38:21,926 --> 01:38:24,346
For goodness' sake,
didn't you hear me knocking?

890
01:38:25,096 --> 01:38:28,099
We did have a date tonight, remember?

891
01:38:31,770 --> 01:38:33,021
You haven't been...?

892
01:38:34,773 --> 01:38:38,777
I should certainly hope not.
Well, let's push off, shall we?

893
01:38:39,653 --> 01:38:42,238
I'd better get a coat. It might be cold out.

894
01:38:42,447 --> 01:38:46,743
I mean, I need a purse,
and I have to fix my hair...

895
01:38:47,661 --> 01:38:49,079
...put some blush on.

896
01:39:07,681 --> 01:39:10,308
<i>There's something I have to tell you.
I'm really...</i>

897
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:17,273
I was at first really nervous about tonight.

898
01:39:18,733 --> 01:39:22,654
But then I decided, darn it, I was going
to show you the time of your life.

899
01:39:22,862 --> 01:39:24,072
That's Clark nice.

900
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:29,828
We could go for a hamburger
or whatever you want to do.

901
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:37,919
Now then...

902
01:39:39,629 --> 01:39:42,757
...given the exact location
of the galaxy that he mentions...

903
01:39:43,341 --> 01:39:46,386
<i>...and the proximity
to our own solar system...</i>

904
01:39:49,139 --> 01:39:51,808
It's amazing. Amazing!

905
01:39:52,934 --> 01:39:54,060
Too good to be true.

906
01:39:54,144 --> 01:39:57,397
It's too good to be true.
6' 4", black hair, blue eyes...

907
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:59,858
...doesn't drink or smoke
and tells the truth.

908
01:40:00,233 --> 01:40:02,777
<i>Some people can read War and Peace...</i>

909
01:40:03,361 --> 01:40:05,488
...and think it was an adventure story.

910
01:40:06,156 --> 01:40:08,950
Others can read the ingredients
on a gum wrapper...

911
01:40:09,034 --> 01:40:11,202
...and unlock the secrets of the universe.

912
01:40:12,704 --> 01:40:16,333
Lex, what has chewing gum got to do
with the secrets of the universe?

913
01:40:19,377 --> 01:40:20,962
Right, Miss Teschmacher.

914
01:40:24,591 --> 01:40:26,092
"N."

915
01:40:26,885 --> 01:40:29,346
"M"? You want "M," Mr. Luthor?
Coming right up.

916
01:40:31,014 --> 01:40:32,599
So there you go, "M."

917
01:40:32,807 --> 01:40:34,851
"M" as in "moron," Otis? No.

918
01:40:35,018 --> 01:40:37,062
<i>It's "N" as in "Neanderthal"...</i>

919
01:40:37,395 --> 01:40:40,106
..."nincompoop," "nitwit,"
and "L" as in "ladder."

920
01:40:40,190 --> 01:40:41,983
Here's a ladder, coming right up.

921
01:40:42,067 --> 01:40:44,027
<i>I didn't see...</i>

922
01:40:44,819 --> 01:40:46,237
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor.

923
01:40:47,864 --> 01:40:51,159
In the interview he says
that the Planet Krypton...

924
01:40:53,036 --> 01:40:54,913
...exploded in 1948.

925
01:40:55,664 --> 01:40:57,457
That ridiculous little freak...

926
01:40:57,916 --> 01:41:00,377
...took three years in a rocket
to get to earth.

927
01:41:01,127 --> 01:41:02,754
<i>- Ergo...
- Ergo.</i>

928
01:41:03,046 --> 01:41:05,632
Ergo 1948, that's three years on.

929
01:41:06,549 --> 01:41:07,967
He's 6' 4", you know that?

930
01:41:08,176 --> 01:41:13,056
Do you know why the number 200 is
so vitally descriptive to both you and me?

931
01:41:13,556 --> 01:41:15,100
It's your weight and my I.Q.

932
01:41:15,225 --> 01:41:16,559
Think, people, think.

933
01:41:18,228 --> 01:41:21,147
Deductive reasoning.
That's the name of the game.

934
01:41:23,108 --> 01:41:25,026
Fragments from the Planet Krypton...

935
01:41:25,568 --> 01:41:27,654
...exploded and went into outer space.

936
01:41:27,821 --> 01:41:29,614
It is reasonable to assume...

937
01:41:29,739 --> 01:41:32,742
...that some of those particles of debris
drifted to Earth.

938
01:41:35,662 --> 01:41:36,579
Meteorites!

939
01:41:37,163 --> 01:41:38,081
<i>Jawohl.</i>

940
01:41:39,958 --> 01:41:40,709
<i>Voilà!</i>

941
01:41:47,048 --> 01:41:47,924
<i>Voilà!</i>

942
01:41:52,137 --> 01:41:54,597
A meteorite found in Addis Ababa?

943
01:41:55,932 --> 01:41:58,393
I know I'll get rapped
in the mouth for this, but...

944
01:41:58,476 --> 01:41:59,644
...so what?

945
01:42:00,270 --> 01:42:02,939
So what? You mean to us
they're just meteorites.

946
01:42:03,857 --> 01:42:04,816
Fair enough.

947
01:42:05,775 --> 01:42:08,278
But the level of specific radioactivity...

948
01:42:08,361 --> 01:42:11,031
...is so high to anyone
from the Planet Krypton...

949
01:42:11,448 --> 01:42:13,033
...this substance is lethal.

950
01:42:13,700 --> 01:42:15,160
Wait a minute, Mr. Luthor.

951
01:42:15,577 --> 01:42:18,204
Fire and bullets can't hurt this guy...

952
01:42:18,371 --> 01:42:19,789
...but this stuff here...

953
01:42:19,873 --> 01:42:22,042
...will kill him.

954
01:42:25,545 --> 01:42:27,505
Doesn't it give you a kind of...

955
01:42:27,589 --> 01:42:31,301
...a shudder of electricity through you
to be in the same room with me?

956
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:35,847
Not like the shudder you'll get
when you lay that rock on him.

957
01:42:35,972 --> 01:42:39,225
He can see you coming for miles
with those super peepers of his.

958
01:42:39,434 --> 01:42:42,812
O Lord, you gave them eyes,
but they cannot see...

959
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:45,648
...nor can Superman, through lead.

960
01:42:47,692 --> 01:42:50,070
He can't see through lead?

961
01:42:50,445 --> 01:42:52,447
And Kryptonite will destroy him.

962
01:42:56,117 --> 01:42:57,452
Any questions, class?

963
01:42:58,828 --> 01:43:01,122
I wonder what they're wearing
in Addis Ababa?

964
01:43:01,790 --> 01:43:03,249
Looks like a burnoose.

965
01:43:03,375 --> 01:43:05,543
It's just a wraparound.

966
01:43:05,669 --> 01:43:08,380
Are we going to Addis Ababa, Mr. Luthor?

967
01:43:09,422 --> 01:43:11,508
<i>Mother Bird to Missile Convoy, over.</i>

968
01:43:11,966 --> 01:43:14,219
<i>Missile Convoy to Mother Bird, go ahead.</i>

969
01:43:14,469 --> 01:43:18,390
<i>Everything looks good,
see you at the base. Over and out.</i>

970
01:43:18,890 --> 01:43:21,267
<i>Roger, Mother Bird. Over and out.</i>

971
01:44:04,602 --> 01:44:05,645
Look at this!

972
01:44:06,354 --> 01:44:07,564
Looks pretty bad.

973
01:44:12,402 --> 01:44:13,528
Take her pulse.

974
01:44:23,955 --> 01:44:25,665
Get an ambulance down here.

975
01:44:25,749 --> 01:44:29,044
I don't want to hold this convoy up
more than I have to.

976
01:44:29,127 --> 01:44:31,588
She's having trouble breathing.
What do you think?

977
01:44:31,671 --> 01:44:34,674
I suggest a vigorous chest massage.

978
01:44:34,758 --> 01:44:37,260
If that doesn't work, mouth-to-mouth.

979
01:44:37,344 --> 01:44:38,345
Yes, sir!

980
01:44:39,971 --> 01:44:43,308
I won't have my men do anything
I wouldn't be prepared to do myself.

981
01:44:43,558 --> 01:44:44,726
Get an ambulance.

982
01:44:45,018 --> 01:44:46,102
Gather around.

983
01:44:47,937 --> 01:44:49,022
Turn around!

984
01:45:17,217 --> 01:45:18,218
Hi.

985
01:45:18,968 --> 01:45:19,969
Somebody hurt?

986
01:45:36,319 --> 01:45:39,030
I did it, Mr. Luthor.

987
01:45:39,656 --> 01:45:41,366
Miss Teschmacher, I did it.

988
01:45:41,992 --> 01:45:44,828
- Just like you told me.
- All right, Otis.

989
01:45:44,953 --> 01:45:47,080
<i>It isn't that I don't trust you, but...</i>

990
01:45:48,289 --> 01:45:50,542
I don't trust you, Otis. What did you do?

991
01:45:51,668 --> 01:45:55,338
I set the first directional vector...

992
01:45:55,755 --> 01:45:57,257
...to 38.

993
01:45:57,507 --> 01:46:01,386
The second one to 67.
And the third one to 117.

994
01:46:01,678 --> 01:46:03,221
What about the fourth one?

995
01:46:03,555 --> 01:46:04,806
What fourth one?

996
01:46:05,015 --> 01:46:08,351
Wait a minute. The third one to 117?

997
01:46:08,518 --> 01:46:12,188
- Yes. See, I wrote it down, Mr. Luthor.
- Otis!

998
01:46:13,315 --> 01:46:16,359
The third one was supposed to be 11,
and the fourth one, 7.

999
01:46:18,486 --> 01:46:20,655
Oh, gee, Mr. Luthor.

1000
01:46:20,989 --> 01:46:23,658
I guess my arm wasn't long enough, see.

1001
01:46:23,742 --> 01:46:25,869
Would you like to see a long arm?

1002
01:46:26,202 --> 01:46:29,664
Otis, would you like to see
a very, very, long arm?

1003
01:46:29,748 --> 01:46:30,957
No, Mr. Luthor.

1004
01:46:45,305 --> 01:46:48,475
- All right. Get it right.
- Yes, Mr. Luthor.

1005
01:46:51,102 --> 01:46:54,022
I thought you told me
this road would be blocked off?

1006
01:46:54,105 --> 01:46:57,359
- Jablowsky, didn't I tell you...
- I didn't ask him, I asked you.

1007
01:46:58,693 --> 01:47:00,403
All right. Follow me, men.

1008
01:47:02,113 --> 01:47:05,367
Back that thing off the road.
Back it off the road.

1009
01:47:15,251 --> 01:47:18,171
You'll have to circle back.
I don't have time to argue.

1010
01:47:18,254 --> 01:47:19,923
It's a heck of a day, isn't it?

1011
01:47:27,597 --> 01:47:30,266
- Route 12? That's back there.
- No, sir, it's up there.

1012
01:47:33,353 --> 01:47:36,940
- Sergeant, we took the wrong road.
- I'm a Lieutenant. A Naval Officer.

1013
01:47:44,447 --> 01:47:47,742
Shut up! Now Route 12 is back that way.

1014
01:47:53,957 --> 01:47:56,084
This man is a diabetic, you see.

1015
01:48:07,303 --> 01:48:11,016
<i>As you know, the Daily Planet
is very interested in that dam...</i>

1016
01:48:11,391 --> 01:48:13,143
...but what I don't understand...

1017
01:48:13,226 --> 01:48:16,229
...is why you'd sell out to a faceless person
you've never met?

1018
01:48:16,312 --> 01:48:17,689
You don't know his name.

1019
01:48:21,526 --> 01:48:23,862
At the stupid high price he offered...

1020
01:48:23,945 --> 01:48:26,364
...for this worthless piece of desert...

1021
01:48:26,448 --> 01:48:28,325
...I hope it's Custer!

1022
01:48:30,493 --> 01:48:32,662
Perfect, just what I need. Thank you.

<i>Reporting live from the launch site,

Hi, everybody.
Has anybody seen Lois today?

1028
01:48:51,973 --> 01:48:54,184
No, but the Chief wants to see you.

1029
01:48:54,267 --> 01:48:56,102
You're blocking the set, Clark.

1030
01:48:56,895 --> 01:48:59,522
Sorry, Gil. How's Judy today? Okay?

1031
01:48:59,606 --> 01:49:00,440
Good.

1032
01:49:01,358 --> 01:49:02,651
Excuse me, Mr. White.

1033
01:49:02,734 --> 01:49:05,695
You wanted to see me, sir?
Have you seen Lois today?

1034
01:49:06,613 --> 01:49:08,948
She's out West,
looking into a land-fraud deal.

1035
01:49:09,282 --> 01:49:11,910
I sent young Olsen with her
on his first assignment.

1036
01:49:11,993 --> 01:49:15,288
Some unidentified clown
is buying thousands of acres...

1037
01:49:15,372 --> 01:49:17,582
...of worthless desert at incredible prices.

1038
01:49:17,707 --> 01:49:19,417
That doesn't seem to make sense.

1039
01:49:19,501 --> 01:49:22,253
The world doesn't make sense.
You ought to know that.

1040
01:49:22,671 --> 01:49:24,798
Look at this dispatch from Addis Ababa.

1041
01:49:25,173 --> 01:49:29,135
People break into a museum at night,
kill two people, and what do they take?

1042
01:49:29,219 --> 01:49:32,013
A worthless piece of meteorite.
How do you figure that?

1043
01:49:32,889 --> 01:49:35,600
I've never been able
to understand violence.

1044
01:49:36,226 --> 01:49:37,560
I know that about you.

1045
01:49:37,727 --> 01:49:39,646
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1046
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:43,525
I've been in this news game
40 years man and boy...

1047
01:49:44,150 --> 01:49:47,404
...and I got where I am
with guts, compassion...

1048
01:49:47,821 --> 01:49:50,865
...elbow grease and something
you're sadly lacking in, son.

1049
01:49:51,825 --> 01:49:52,617
Humility?

1050
01:49:52,951 --> 01:49:55,537
Not humility, you've got bags of humility.

1051
01:49:56,037 --> 01:49:58,248
Aggression, confidence, that's the ticket.

1052
01:49:58,581 --> 01:50:00,709
Take charge.
Let people know who you are.

1053
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:10,885
<i>This is Lex Luthor.</i>

1054
01:50:11,428 --> 01:50:15,015
<i>Only one thing alive with less than
four legs can hear this frequency.</i>

1055
01:50:15,098 --> 01:50:16,099
<i>That's you.</i>

1056
01:50:16,599 --> 01:50:21,313
<i>In five minutes, a poisoned gas pellet
containing propane lithium compound...</i>

1057
01:50:21,855 --> 01:50:24,941
<i>...will be released through thousands
of air ducts in this city...</i>

1058
01:50:25,025 --> 01:50:28,445
<i>...effectively annihilating
half the population of Metropolis.</i>

1059
01:50:28,528 --> 01:50:31,656
I was a reporter before most of my friends
were copy boys.

1060
01:50:32,073 --> 01:50:34,784
I want you to get Lois
to introduce you to Superman.

1061
01:50:35,076 --> 01:50:38,246
Find out who he is.
Where did he get that blue suit?

1062
01:50:38,371 --> 01:50:41,124
Did he have it made?
Is it silk? Is it plastic?

1063
01:50:41,791 --> 01:50:43,543
<i>I know it all seems a bit much...</i>

1064
01:50:43,626 --> 01:50:46,087
<i>...but how else was I going to meet you,
Superman?</i>

1065
01:50:46,254 --> 01:50:49,466
<i>I knew you'd never accept
an invitation to tea.</i>

1066
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:55,013
<i>But a disaster, with people in danger,
people who need help...</i>

1067
01:50:56,598 --> 01:51:00,727
<i>I just knew you couldn't resist
that chance to sort of pitch in.</i>

1068
01:51:01,519 --> 01:51:02,854
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

1069
01:51:36,221 --> 01:51:39,432
<i>There's a strong streak of good in you,
Superman.</i>

1070
01:51:40,558 --> 01:51:42,268
<i>But then nobody's perfect.</i>

1071
01:51:45,730 --> 01:51:47,107
<i>Almost nobody.</i>

1072
01:51:56,366 --> 01:51:57,701
- Oh, Superman!
- Gee!

1073
01:51:58,118 --> 01:52:01,037
Stand back, please.
Nothing to get worried about.

1074
01:52:06,876 --> 01:52:08,837
Don't sit there like a numskull, get out!

1075
01:52:22,684 --> 01:52:25,312
Look at that overgrown boy scout,
Miss Teschmacher.

1076
01:52:26,187 --> 01:52:27,605
Tell me what you see?

1077
01:52:28,565 --> 01:52:30,358
Cuteness, dimples.

1078
01:52:31,192 --> 01:52:32,360
You like cuteness?

1079
01:52:33,486 --> 01:52:34,321
Dimples.

1080
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:36,614
I'll give you dimples.

1081
01:53:11,358 --> 01:53:13,360
<i>The pressure is still on you.</i>

1082
01:53:14,110 --> 01:53:16,363
<i>You know they say:
If you can't stand the heat...</i>

1083
01:53:16,446 --> 01:53:17,947
...get out of the tunnel.

1084
01:53:41,429 --> 01:53:43,181
It's your last chance, Superman.

1085
01:53:44,182 --> 01:53:46,601
<i>Why don't you do yourself a flavor
and freeze.</i>

1086
01:54:48,413 --> 01:54:49,998
I think he's coming, Mr. Luthor.

1087
01:55:01,176 --> 01:55:02,969
He's definitely coming.

1088
01:55:14,564 --> 01:55:15,857
It's open, come in.

1089
01:55:18,652 --> 01:55:21,946
My attorney will be in touch with you
about the damage to the door.

1090
01:55:22,072 --> 01:55:23,823
Otis, take the gentleman's cape.

1091
01:55:29,663 --> 01:55:31,456
I don't think he wants me to.

1092
01:55:31,539 --> 01:55:32,957
Where's the gas pellet?

1093
01:55:33,625 --> 01:55:34,501
Somewhere.

1094
01:55:36,753 --> 01:55:38,755
It's in the back of my mind, actually.

1095
01:55:39,881 --> 01:55:41,758
It's a little idea I was toying with.

1096
01:55:41,841 --> 01:55:44,552
Is that how a warped brain like yours
gets its kicks?

1097
01:55:44,636 --> 01:55:46,846
By planning the death of innocent people?

1098
01:55:47,806 --> 01:55:49,683
By causing the death of innocent people.

1099
01:55:49,849 --> 01:55:50,850
<i>Fire!</i>

1100
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:56,147
<i>Navy Bird, we have a good launch.</i>

1101
01:55:56,731 --> 01:55:58,191
<i>Navy missile...</i>

1102
01:56:07,450 --> 01:56:09,953
As you may or may not know,
I am, as they say...

1103
01:56:10,787 --> 01:56:12,622
...very heavy into real estate.

1104
01:56:13,248 --> 01:56:17,502
To make money, you have to buy
for a little and sell for a lot, right?

1105
01:56:17,877 --> 01:56:18,837
Right.

1106
01:56:20,380 --> 01:56:21,881
So, the problem?

1107
01:56:23,133 --> 01:56:26,261
How to make the land more valuable
between the time you buy it...

1108
01:56:26,344 --> 01:56:27,929
...and the time you sell it?

1109
01:56:28,805 --> 01:56:30,724
Now this is California.

1110
01:56:31,391 --> 01:56:33,643
The richest, most populous state
in the Union.

1111
01:56:33,727 --> 01:56:35,895
I don't need a geography lesson from you.

1112
01:56:36,855 --> 01:56:40,483
Of course, you've been there.
I do forget, you get around, don't you?

1113
01:56:41,151 --> 01:56:42,152
Where was I?

1114
01:56:42,694 --> 01:56:44,321
- California.
- California, right.

1115
01:56:44,404 --> 01:56:47,032
The San Andreas Fault,
maybe you've heard of it?

1116
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:49,534
Yes. It's the joining together
of two land masses.

1117
01:56:49,617 --> 01:56:53,330
The fault line is shifting, which is why
you get earthquakes in California.

1118
01:56:53,997 --> 01:56:56,374
Wonderful!
Couldn't have said it better myself.

1119
01:56:57,250 --> 01:57:01,504
Everything west of this line is the richest,
most expensive real estate in the world.

1120
01:57:01,629 --> 01:57:04,215
San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco.

1121
01:57:04,299 --> 01:57:06,217
Everything on this side of the line...

1122
01:57:06,343 --> 01:57:09,346
...is just hundreds of miles
of worthless desert land...

1123
01:57:09,429 --> 01:57:11,681
<i>...which just happens to be owned by...</i>

1124
01:57:11,806 --> 01:57:13,933
Lex Luthor Incorporated.

1125
01:57:15,185 --> 01:57:18,688
Now, call me foolish, call me irresponsible.

1126
01:57:19,689 --> 01:57:22,734
It occurs to me that a 500-megaton bomb...

1127
01:57:23,068 --> 01:57:25,528
<i>...planted at just the proper point would...</i>

1128
01:57:25,862 --> 01:57:28,073
Would destroy most of California.

1129
01:57:29,616 --> 01:57:33,286
<i>Millions of people would be killed
and the West Coast as we know it would...</i>

1130
01:57:33,370 --> 01:57:36,623
Fall into the sea. Bye-bye, California.

1131
01:57:37,791 --> 01:57:40,377
Hello, new West Coast. My West Coast.

1132
01:57:43,046 --> 01:57:44,714
Costa Del Lex, Luthorville.

1133
01:57:45,215 --> 01:57:47,008
Marina Del Lex, Otisburg.

1134
01:57:49,844 --> 01:57:51,096
"Otisburg"?

1135
01:57:51,262 --> 01:57:53,598
Miss Teschmacher,
she's got her own place.

1136
01:57:53,682 --> 01:57:54,599
"Otisburg"?

1137
01:57:54,891 --> 01:57:56,393
It's a little bitty place.

1138
01:57:56,559 --> 01:57:57,560
Otisburg?

1139
01:57:58,895 --> 01:58:01,189
I'll just wipe it off, that's all.

1140
01:58:01,314 --> 01:58:03,024
You're a dreamer, Lex Luthor.

1141
01:58:03,108 --> 01:58:06,111
A sick, twisted dreamer.
Your plan couldn't possibly work.

1142
01:58:06,736 --> 01:58:08,822
I'll admit there were a few problems.

1143
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,908
Adjusting the precise trajectory
of the missile.

1144
01:58:12,409 --> 01:58:15,495
Finding the optimum stress point
for the fault line itself...

1145
01:58:16,246 --> 01:58:19,749
...which, by the way, is target zero.
Right...

1146
01:58:20,417 --> 01:58:21,292
...here.

1147
01:58:47,444 --> 01:58:49,112
That's impossible!

1148
01:58:51,072 --> 01:58:52,782
What's happening, Lieutenant?

1149
01:58:52,866 --> 01:58:54,451
Trajectory malfunction, sir.

1150
01:58:56,745 --> 01:58:57,620
Abort.

1151
01:58:58,621 --> 01:59:00,081
<i>All counter control units...</i>

1152
01:59:00,165 --> 01:59:02,292
<i>...remove vacuum pressure to maximum.</i>

1153
01:59:04,669 --> 01:59:06,004
Function negative, sir.

1154
01:59:06,087 --> 01:59:07,422
Can't you knock them down?

1155
01:59:07,505 --> 01:59:11,843
Absolutely impossible, sir. They have
the new P-20 low-level avoidance systems.

1156
01:59:12,218 --> 01:59:13,678
Get me the Pentagon.

1157
01:59:20,727 --> 01:59:23,313
What do you think, super baby?
Interesting?

1158
01:59:23,813 --> 01:59:25,940
Your theory's quite impressive, Luthor.

1159
01:59:26,024 --> 01:59:28,318
Would you go to the viewing room, please?

1160
01:59:29,152 --> 01:59:31,988
But as for the rest,
it's nothing but a sick fantasy.

1161
01:59:32,155 --> 01:59:33,031
Fantasy?

1162
01:59:33,365 --> 01:59:34,324
No.

1163
01:59:35,367 --> 01:59:37,702
It's history. It's happening, Superman.

1164
01:59:38,495 --> 01:59:40,163
Miss Teschmacher!

1165
01:59:44,918 --> 01:59:46,169
Yes, Lex?

1166
01:59:46,544 --> 01:59:47,962
Where's the rocket now?

1167
01:59:48,171 --> 01:59:51,841
It's going like a bat over the Grand Canyon,
so is the other one.

1168
01:59:51,966 --> 01:59:53,009
The other one?

1169
01:59:53,343 --> 01:59:54,678
There are two of them?

1170
01:59:57,722 --> 02:00:00,016
Yes, Superman, double jeopardy.

1171
02:00:00,684 --> 02:00:03,728
Even you, with your great speed,
couldn't stop both of them.

1172
02:00:03,853 --> 02:00:06,940
While I, on the other hand,
could stop them with my detonator.

1173
02:00:07,399 --> 02:00:09,192
All right, Luthor, where is it?

1174
02:00:09,901 --> 02:00:11,319
Where's the detonator?

1175
02:00:24,833 --> 02:00:26,334
Diseased maniac!

1176
02:00:26,876 --> 02:00:29,963
Do you think you could hide it from me
by encasing it in lead?

1177
02:00:31,923 --> 02:00:34,300
I'll mold this box into your prison bars.

1178
02:00:34,384 --> 02:00:35,552
Don't touch that.

1179
02:00:42,392 --> 02:00:43,435
I told you.

1180
02:00:44,185 --> 02:00:45,437
It's Kryptonite.

1181
02:00:45,854 --> 02:00:47,814
A little souvenir from your hometown.

1182
02:00:48,106 --> 02:00:50,567
I've spared no expense
to make you feel at home.

1183
02:00:58,241 --> 02:00:59,784
You were great in your day.

1184
02:01:00,744 --> 02:01:02,579
But it just stands to reason...

1185
02:01:02,912 --> 02:01:05,165
...when it came time
to cash in your chips...

1186
02:01:05,582 --> 02:01:10,128
...this old diseased maniac
would be your banker.

1187
02:01:14,591 --> 02:01:15,717
Mind over muscle.

1188
02:01:24,351 --> 02:01:28,480
You don't even care
where the other missile's headed, do you?

1189
02:01:28,938 --> 02:01:30,106
Certainly I do.

1190
02:01:31,608 --> 02:01:33,485
I know exactly where it's headed.

1191
02:01:33,610 --> 02:01:35,070
Hackensack, New Jersey.

1192
02:01:40,867 --> 02:01:45,288
I have to leave you now. No hard feelings.
We all have our little faults.

1193
02:01:46,039 --> 02:01:47,540
Mine's in California.

1194
02:02:02,389 --> 02:02:05,266
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.

1195
02:03:11,875 --> 02:03:13,668
Please, you can't...

1196
02:03:14,252 --> 02:03:15,920
...you can't just stand there.

1197
02:03:19,507 --> 02:03:24,012
You can't just stand
and let millions of innocent people die.

1198
02:03:24,888 --> 02:03:25,722
Maybe.

1199
02:03:27,724 --> 02:03:30,226
Please, help me to save them.

1200
02:03:32,270 --> 02:03:34,773
Would you promise
to save my mother first?

1201
02:03:35,899 --> 02:03:37,859
<i>But, Lois, and Jimmy...</i>

1202
02:03:37,942 --> 02:03:39,611
But my mother comes first.

1203
02:03:39,694 --> 02:03:43,156
If you promise, I'll believe you
because you always tell the truth.

1204
02:03:45,575 --> 02:03:47,202
I promise, I promise.

1205
02:04:42,632 --> 02:04:44,092
Why did you kiss me first?

1206
02:04:47,053 --> 02:04:49,305
I didn't think you'd let me later.

1207
02:04:50,598 --> 02:04:52,183
Thank you, Miss Teschmacher.

1208
02:04:52,684 --> 02:04:55,770
Why is it I can't get it on
with the good guys?

1209
02:05:01,818 --> 02:05:04,446
Stand aside now.
I wouldn't stay here, either.

1210
02:05:23,381 --> 02:05:25,008
<i>Army Bird still heading due east.</i>

1211
02:05:25,091 --> 02:05:26,968
<i>Navy Bird still heading due west.</i>

1212
02:05:27,052 --> 02:05:28,511
<i>Losing radar contact.</i>

1213
02:05:29,095 --> 02:05:31,181
<i>Next radar contact after three seconds.</i>

1214
02:05:52,410 --> 02:05:54,287
Army Bird still headed east, sir.

1215
02:06:49,134 --> 02:06:50,844
<i>Army Bird gaining altitude.</i>

1216
02:06:50,927 --> 02:06:52,429
Miss Teschmacher!

1217
02:06:52,721 --> 02:06:54,514
<i>Radar contact strong.</i>

1218
02:06:55,515 --> 02:06:56,850
Miss Teschmacher!

1219
02:06:57,183 --> 02:06:59,436
<i>Radar report Navy Bird. San Andreas area.</i>

1220
02:07:02,772 --> 02:07:05,108
<i>Navy Bird heading down,
15 seconds to impact.</i>

1221
02:07:05,608 --> 02:07:07,027
<i>15 seconds and counting.</i>

1222
02:08:06,086 --> 02:08:09,339
<i>A military missile has exploded
in the Southern California desert.</i>

1223
02:08:09,798 --> 02:08:12,717
<i>The force of the explosion has activated
the San Andreas fault.</i>

1224
02:08:12,801 --> 02:08:15,053
<i>California is suffering a major earthquake.</i>

1225
02:09:00,724 --> 02:09:02,726
What's going on?

1226
02:09:04,561 --> 02:09:05,854
It's a quake! Look!

1227
02:10:14,547 --> 02:10:16,257
Okay, kids, it's all right now.

1228
02:10:17,050 --> 02:10:18,593
Hey, it's Superman!

1229
02:10:27,143 --> 02:10:28,812
Holy mackerel!

1230
02:10:30,021 --> 02:10:31,523
We're going off the tracks.

1231
02:11:07,684 --> 02:11:09,185
<i>All personnel evacuate dam.</i>

1232
02:11:21,573 --> 02:11:22,741
Watch that cable!

1233
02:11:30,457 --> 02:11:32,167
Someone try and pull the main.

1234
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:34,377
It's impossible. It's red hot!

1235
02:11:42,969 --> 02:11:44,304
Is that man all right?

1236
02:11:44,429 --> 02:11:45,388
Yeah.

1237
02:12:09,287 --> 02:12:10,288
Hang on, Jim.

1238
02:12:21,216 --> 02:12:22,342
The dam broke.

1239
02:12:30,433 --> 02:12:31,768
You're safe here, son.

1240
02:12:33,436 --> 02:12:36,106
That's okay. Miss Lane
will be driving by any minute.

1241
02:12:45,365 --> 02:12:47,075
- Come on!
- Make it to the hill.

1242
02:12:54,624 --> 02:12:57,627
<i>There has been major quake damage
to Southern California.</i>

1243
02:12:57,877 --> 02:13:00,422
<i>The San Andreas fault has miraculously
sealed itself.</i>

1244
02:13:00,505 --> 02:13:04,509
<i>Yet Southern California is suffering
an aftershock of a major earthquake.</i>

1245
02:13:05,051 --> 02:13:07,345
<i>The population is still warned
to be aware...</i>

1246
02:13:09,431 --> 02:13:10,974
Please, come on, turn over.

1247
02:13:12,100 --> 02:13:12,892
Come on!

1248
02:13:40,253 --> 02:13:43,089
Help me. Help me, please.

1249
02:18:55,986 --> 02:18:58,113
<i>It is forbidden for you to interfere...</i>

1250
02:18:58,655 --> 02:19:02,659
<i>There's one thing I do know, Son,
and that is you are here for a reason.</i>

1251
02:19:04,244 --> 02:19:05,328
<i>It is forbidden.</i>

1252
02:19:05,412 --> 02:19:08,248
<i>All those things I can do.
All those powers...</i>

1253
02:19:09,290 --> 02:19:11,042
<i>...but I couldn't even save him.</i>

1254
02:19:15,255 --> 02:19:16,715
<i>It is forbidden.</i>

1255
02:20:42,133 --> 02:20:42,884
Hi.

1256
02:20:44,928 --> 02:20:46,429
Don't bother, it's dead.

1257
02:20:48,598 --> 02:20:49,599
Sure it's dead.

1258
02:20:51,559 --> 02:20:54,980
The problem with men of steel is
they're never around when you want one.

1259
02:20:55,063 --> 02:20:57,774
Do you know what happened
while you were off flying around?

1260
02:20:57,857 --> 02:21:01,653
I was almost in an earthquake.
A gas station blew up beside my car.

1261
02:21:01,736 --> 02:21:05,615
Telephone poles falling all over the road.
I was almost killed.

1262
02:21:05,699 --> 02:21:08,785
To top the whole thing off,
this stupid car runs out of gas.

1263
02:21:09,035 --> 02:21:10,537
I'm sorry about that, Lois.

1264
02:21:10,996 --> 02:21:13,039
But I've been kind of busy for a while.

1265
02:21:15,792 --> 02:21:17,961
I'm sorry, that's all right.

1266
02:21:30,056 --> 02:21:31,474
Thanks a lot, Superman.

1267
02:21:31,725 --> 02:21:34,227
Put me in the middle of nowhere
during an earthquake.

1268
02:21:34,311 --> 02:21:38,023
No food, no water, snakes everywhere.
I had no idea if you were coming back.

1269
02:21:40,567 --> 02:21:43,278
There's something I have to do.
I'll see you later.

1270
02:21:46,072 --> 02:21:47,574
He can't stay still for a second.

1271
02:21:50,702 --> 02:21:54,247
Golly, Miss Lane, it's too bad
Mr. Kent wasn't here to see all this.

1272
02:21:54,331 --> 02:21:57,083
<i>Yeah, poor Clark.
He's never around when...</i>

1273
02:21:58,543 --> 02:22:00,587
<i>Clark... Wait a minute.</i>

1274
02:22:00,962 --> 02:22:01,796
What?

1275
02:22:03,340 --> 02:22:05,300
Lois Lane, that is the silliest idea.

1276
02:22:05,759 --> 02:22:09,304
I'll tell you something, Miss Lane.
I think he really cares about you.

1277
02:22:09,846 --> 02:22:12,140
- Clark? Of course, he does.
- No, not Clark.

1278
02:22:16,102 --> 02:22:18,104
Superman cares about everybody, Jimmy.

1279
02:22:19,272 --> 02:22:22,692
<i>But who knows. Someday, if he's lucky...</i>

1280
02:22:36,039 --> 02:22:37,540
You're messing up my suit!

1281
02:22:42,003 --> 02:22:44,422
<i>Otis! Watch the ground, you...</i>

1282
02:22:45,298 --> 02:22:46,716
Good evening, Warden.

1283
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:49,970
These two men should be safe here
'til they can get a fair trial.

1284
02:22:50,053 --> 02:22:51,304
Who is it, Superman?

1285
02:22:53,682 --> 02:22:54,599
Lex Luthor.

1286
02:22:55,183 --> 02:22:57,811
- The greatest criminal mind of our time.
- Of our time.

1287
02:22:57,894 --> 02:23:00,188
- I hereby serve notice...
- He's serving notice to you.

1288
02:23:00,271 --> 02:23:01,898
...that these walls...

1289
02:23:02,232 --> 02:23:04,234
Will you shut up, you fat little fool!

1290
02:23:04,401 --> 02:23:05,610
You, you nitwit!

1291
02:23:05,902 --> 02:23:07,028
Nincompoop!

1292
02:23:07,445 --> 02:23:08,655
This country...

1293
02:23:08,738 --> 02:23:11,366
...is safe again, Superman, thanks to you.

1294
02:23:11,866 --> 02:23:12,617
No, sir.

1295
02:23:12,701 --> 02:23:14,035
Don't thank me, Warden.

1296
02:23:14,494 --> 02:23:16,287
We're all part of the same team.

1297
02:23:16,705 --> 02:23:17,706
Good night.
