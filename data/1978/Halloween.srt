1
00:02:08,184 --> 00:02:11,729
<i>Black cats and goblins
and broomsticks and ghosts</i>

2
00:02:11,897 --> 00:02:15,066
<i>Covens of witches with all of their hosts</i>

3
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:18,444
<i>You may think they scare me,
you're probably right</i>

4
00:02:18,612 --> 00:02:21,422
<i>Black cats and goblins on Halloween night</i>

5
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,466
Trick or treat.

6
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:48,074
- My parents won't be home until 10.
- Are you sure?

7
00:02:57,651 --> 00:02:59,519
We are alone, aren't we?

8
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:01,909
Michael's around someplace.

9
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:05,367
Take off that thing.

10
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:10,063
- Let's go upstairs.
- Okay.

11
00:04:31,912 --> 00:04:34,664
Look, Judith, it's really late. I gotta go.

12
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:37,212
Will you call me tomorrow?

13
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:39,273
- Yeah, sure.
- Promise?

14
00:04:39,353 --> 00:04:40,854
Yeah.

15
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:49,401
Michael?

16
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:55,904
Oh, God!

17
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:31,081
Michael?

18
00:07:45,313 --> 00:07:47,925
Ever done anything like this before?

19
00:07:48,608 --> 00:07:50,673
Only minimum security.

20
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:52,701
I see.

21
00:07:54,489 --> 00:07:57,776
The driveway's a few hundred
yards up on the right.

22
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,597
The only thing that ever
bothers me is their jibberish.

23
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,672
When they start raving on and on.

24
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,383
You don't have anything to worry about.

25
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:12,874
He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.

26
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:16,181
Are there any special instructions?

27
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:19,364
Just try to understand
what we're dealing with here.

28
00:08:19,723 --> 00:08:21,186
Don't underestimate it.

29
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:24,411
Don't you think we could refer to it as him?

30
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,905
If you say so.

31
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:30,348
Your compassion's overwhelming, doctor.

32
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:40,889
What do I give him when we take him
in front of the judge?

33
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:42,729
Thorazine.

34
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,172
- He'll barely be able to sit up.
- That's the idea.

35
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:59,433
You're serious about it, aren't you?

36
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:01,014
Yeah.

37
00:09:02,849 --> 00:09:05,022
You mean you actually
never want him to get out?

38
00:09:05,102 --> 00:09:07,124
Never, never...

39
00:09:07,704 --> 00:09:09,276
...never.

40
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:11,862
Then why are we taking him up
to Hardin County if we just gonna...

41
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:14,394
Because that is the law.

42
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,047
Here we are.

43
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:26,091
Since when did they let them wander around?

44
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:29,571
- Pull up to the main gate.
- Shouldn't we put...

45
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:31,710
Go on, move.

46
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:42,121
Stop here.

47
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:48,236
- Shouldn't we go on up to the hospital...
- Wait.

48
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:49,843
- Are you all right? You all right?
- Yes, I'm okay.

49
00:10:49,923 --> 00:10:53,932
He's gone. He's gone from here.
The evil is gone.

50
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:00,759
All right, I got it.

51
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:02,061
Don't forget to drop
the key off at the Myers' place.

52
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:03,887
I won't.

53
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,505
They're coming by to look at the house at
10:30. Be sure you leave it under the mat.

54
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:09,133
Promise.

55
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:43,720
Laurie!

56
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:47,165
Hi, Tommy.

57
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:51,831
- Coming over tonight?
- Same time, same place.

58
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:54,042
- Can we make jack-o'-lanterns?
- Sure.

59
00:12:54,122 --> 00:12:56,253
- Can we watch the monster movies?
- Sure.

60
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,630
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?

61
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,987
Sure, sure, sure.

62
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:05,133
You better hurry up.

63
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:08,139
How come you're walking to school this way?

64
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:10,600
- My dad asked me to.
- Why?

65
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,019
- I have to drop off a key.
- Why?

66
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:15,484
- Because he's gonna sell a house.
- Why?

67
00:13:15,564 --> 00:13:18,191
- Because that's his job.
- Where?

68
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:21,124
- The Myers' house.
- The Myers' house?

69
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:33,206
- You're not supposed to go up there.
- Yes, I am.

70
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:36,168
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.

71
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:38,624
Just watch.

72
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,620
Lonnie Elamb said never to go up there.

73
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,248
Lonnie Elamb said that's a haunted house.
He said awful stuff happened there once.

74
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:58,148
Lonnie Elamb probably won't get out
of the sixth grade.

75
00:13:58,228 --> 00:14:01,042
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.

76
00:14:01,122 --> 00:14:03,149
- Bye.
- Bye.

77
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:10,393
<i>I wish I had you all alone</i>

78
00:14:11,082 --> 00:14:13,935
<i>Just the two of us</i>

79
00:14:16,037 --> 00:14:20,316
<i>I would hold you close to me</i>

80
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:22,985
<i>So close</i>

81
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:29,183
<i>Just the two of us</i>

82
00:14:30,885 --> 00:14:34,374
I'm not responsible, Sam.
I told them how dangerous he was...

83
00:14:34,454 --> 00:14:38,321
You couldn't have. Two Roadblocks and an
all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a 5-year-old.

84
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:41,466
He was your patient. If precautions weren't
strong enough, you should've told somebody.

85
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:44,561
- I told everybody. Nobody listened.
- There's nothing else I can do.

86
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:46,813
You can get back in there
and get back on that telephone.

87
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:50,434
Tell them exactly who walked out last night.
And tell them exactly where he's going.

88
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,669
- Probably going.
- I'm wasting my time.

89
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:56,623
Sam, Haddonfield is 150 miles away from here.
Now, for God's sakes, he can't drive a car.

90
00:14:56,703 --> 00:15:01,149
He was doing very well last night.
Maybe someone around here gave him lessons.

91
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:09,027
<i>Dr. Chance, please report to Ward C.</i>

92
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:13,018
<i>Dr. Chance, Ward C, please.</i>

93
00:15:13,636 --> 00:15:16,309
And the book ends.

94
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:20,713
But what Samuels
is really talking about here...

95
00:15:20,793 --> 00:15:22,594
...is fate.

96
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:24,711
You see...

97
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:28,865
...fate caught up with several lives here.

98
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:33,910
No matter what course of action
Collins took...

99
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,664
...he was destined to his own fate...

100
00:15:37,744 --> 00:15:41,411
...his own day of reckoning with himself.

101
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:43,907
The idea...

102
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:46,923
...is that destiny...

103
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:49,634
...is a very real, concrete thing...

104
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:53,138
...that every person has to deal with.

105
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:57,928
How does Samuels' view of fate
differ from that of Costaine's?

106
00:15:58,008 --> 00:15:59,549
- Laurie?
- Ma'am?

107
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:02,652
- Answer the question.
- Oh, um...

108
00:16:02,732 --> 00:16:06,734
...Costaine wrote that fate was
somehow related only to religion...

109
00:16:06,814 --> 00:16:10,029
...whereas Samuels felt that, well,
fate was like a natural element...

110
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:12,198
...like earth, air, fire and water.

111
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:15,994
That's right.
Samuels definitely personified fate.

112
00:16:16,074 --> 00:16:19,998
In Samuels' writing,
fate is immovable, like a mountain.

113
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,460
It stands where man passes away.

114
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,638
Fate never changes.

115
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:46,232
- Yeah.
- Stupid pumpkin.

116
00:16:46,312 --> 00:16:49,486
- Yeah, how's the little witches?
- Yeah, stupid pumpkin.

117
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:51,529
- Leave me alone.
- He's gonna get you.

118
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:55,368
He's gonna get you. He's gonna get you.
He's gonna get you. He's gonna get you.

119
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,910
He's gonna get you.

120
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,738
- The boogeyman is coming.
- Leave me alone.

121
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:03,186
He doesn't believe us.
Don't you know what happens on Halloween?

122
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:05,709
Yeah, we get candy.

123
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:07,841
The boogeyman, ooh, the boogeyman.

124
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:10,729
The boogeyman, the boogeyman, the boogeyman.

125
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:12,839
The boogeyman.

126
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:46,694
He's on his way.

127
00:18:47,704 --> 00:18:51,252
You've gotta believe me, officer.
He is coming to Haddonfield.

128
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:55,148
Because I know him.

129
00:18:55,628 --> 00:18:58,632
I'm his doctor. You must be ready for him.

130
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:02,393
If you don't, it's your funeral.

131
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,163
We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder

132
00:19:56,243 --> 00:19:58,485
Can't hear us now, we'll yell a little louder

133
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:01,538
We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder,
can't hear us now...

134
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:05,893
Look at you. Look all the books you have.
You need a shopping cart to get home.

135
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,664
Hey, Haddonfield.

136
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:11,838
Yeah, not funny.

137
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,587
You know, it's totally insane. We have
three new cheers to learn in the morning...

138
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:19,441
...the game is in the afternoon,
I have to get my hair done at 5...

139
00:20:19,521 --> 00:20:21,785
...and the dance is at 8.
I'll be totally wiped out.

140
00:20:21,865 --> 00:20:23,261
I don't think you have enough to do tomorrow.

141
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:24,909
Totally.

142
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:32,145
As usual, I have nothing to do.

143
00:20:32,225 --> 00:20:35,428
It's your own fault
and I don't feel a bit sorry for you.

144
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,795
Hey, Lynda, Laurie.
Why didn't you wait for me?

145
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,756
We did. 15 minutes, you totally never showed.

146
00:20:43,836 --> 00:20:46,239
That's not true. Here I am.

147
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:52,431
- What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
- I'm never smiling again.

148
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:55,109
Paul dragged me into the boys'
locker room to tell me...

149
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:57,725
- Exploring uncharted territory?
- It's been totally charted.

150
00:20:57,805 --> 00:21:00,131
- We just talked.
- Sure, sure.

151
00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:05,198
Old jerk-o got caught throwing eggs and
soaping windows. His parents grounded him.

152
00:21:05,278 --> 00:21:07,881
- He can't come over tonight.
- I thought you were babysitting tonight.

153
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:10,249
The only reason she babysits
is to have a place...

154
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:11,934
Shit.

155
00:21:12,014 --> 00:21:14,492
I have a place for that.

156
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:16,981
I forgot my chemistry book.

157
00:21:17,061 --> 00:21:19,492
So who cares?
I always forget my chemistry book.

158
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:23,396
And my math book, and my English book,
and my, let's see, my French book and...

159
00:21:23,476 --> 00:21:27,116
...who needs books anyway? I don't need
books. I always forget all of my books.

160
00:21:27,196 --> 00:21:30,691
I mean, it doesn't really matter
if you have your books or not.

161
00:21:31,884 --> 00:21:34,289
Hey, isn't that Devon Graham?

162
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:37,335
I don't think so.

163
00:21:37,415 --> 00:21:39,278
I think he's cute.

164
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,238
Hey, jerk.

165
00:21:45,318 --> 00:21:47,400
Speed kills.

166
00:21:57,768 --> 00:22:00,021
God, can't you take a joke?

167
00:22:07,486 --> 00:22:11,140
You know, Annie, someday,
you're going to get us all into deep trouble.

168
00:22:13,284 --> 00:22:14,580
Totally.

169
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:18,123
I hate a guy with a car
and no sense of humor.

170
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,755
Well, are we still on for tonight?

171
00:22:22,835 --> 00:22:25,733
I wouldn't wanna get you
in deep trouble, Lynda.

172
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:29,887
Oh, come on, Annie. Bob and I
have been planning on it all week.

173
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:33,741
All right. The Wallaces leave at 7.

174
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:36,316
I'm babysitting the Doyles.
It's only three houses down.

175
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:40,206
- We can keep each other company.
- Oh, terrific. I've got three choices.

176
00:22:40,286 --> 00:22:44,849
Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda
screw around, or talk to you.

177
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,157
I am so mad.

178
00:23:17,014 --> 00:23:18,594
Why don't you buy your own then?

179
00:23:18,674 --> 00:23:23,190
You bummed 20 off me, girl.
What time tonight?

180
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,868
I don't know yet. I have to get out
of taking my brother trick-or-treating.

181
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:29,322
- Saving the treats for Bob?
- Funny. See you.

182
00:23:29,402 --> 00:23:31,929
- Bye.
- Bye.

183
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,838
Annie, look.

184
00:23:45,918 --> 00:23:48,687
- Look where?
- Behind the bush.

185
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:51,177
I don't see anything.

186
00:23:51,257 --> 00:23:54,405
The guy who drove by so fast,
that one you yelled at.

187
00:23:54,485 --> 00:23:56,612
Oh, subtle, isn't he?

188
00:24:03,494 --> 00:24:05,321
Hey, creep.

189
00:24:08,374 --> 00:24:11,648
Laurie, dear, he wants to talk to you.

190
00:24:12,528 --> 00:24:14,997
He wants to take you out tonight.

191
00:24:29,378 --> 00:24:32,676
- He was standing right there.
- Poor Laurie.

192
00:24:32,756 --> 00:24:35,154
You scared another one away.

193
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:38,157
It's tragic. You never go out.

194
00:24:38,237 --> 00:24:41,727
You must have a small fortune
stashed from babysitting so much.

195
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:44,978
- Guys think I'm too smart.
- I don't, I think you're whacko.

196
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:47,705
Now you're seeing men behind bushes.

197
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:52,205
Well, home sweet home.

198
00:24:53,085 --> 00:24:55,007
See you later.

199
00:24:55,087 --> 00:24:57,548
- Bye.
- Bye.

200
00:25:10,077 --> 00:25:11,527
Oh!

201
00:25:11,607 --> 00:25:14,427
- Excuse me, Laurie.
- Oh, Mr. Brackett, I'm sorry, Mr. Brackett.

202
00:25:14,507 --> 00:25:17,613
- Oh, I didn't mean to startle you.
- Oh, it's all right.

203
00:25:17,693 --> 00:25:21,742
You know, it's Halloween. I guess
everyone's entitled to one good scare, huh?

204
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:24,442
Yes, sir. Nice seeing you, sir.

205
00:25:46,305 --> 00:25:48,190
Oh, no.

206
00:25:56,941 --> 00:25:58,475
No.

207
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:05,784
- Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.

208
00:26:09,328 --> 00:26:12,958
Well, kiddo, I thought
you outgrew superstition.

209
00:27:01,897 --> 00:27:03,430
Hello.

210
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,078
Hello?

211
00:27:10,347 --> 00:27:12,374
Who is this?

212
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,323
- Hello?
- <i>Why'd you hang up on me?</i>

213
00:27:24,403 --> 00:27:27,326
- Annie? Was that you?
- <i>Of course.</i>

214
00:27:27,406 --> 00:27:29,536
Why didn't you say anything?
You scared me to death.

215
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:33,432
- <i>I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?</i>
- Thought it was an obscene phone call.

216
00:27:33,512 --> 00:27:36,769
<i>Now, you hear obscene chewing.
You're losing it, Laurie.</i>

217
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:39,321
- I already lost it.
- <i>I doubt that.</i>

218
00:27:39,401 --> 00:27:42,508
<i>Listen, my mother is letting me
use her car. I'll pick you up, 6:30.</i>

219
00:27:42,588 --> 00:27:45,266
- Okay, bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

220
00:27:57,061 --> 00:27:59,138
Just calm down.

221
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:02,475
This is ridiculous.

222
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:21,061
- Hurry up.
- Hi.

223
00:29:29,211 --> 00:29:31,105
Just have time.

224
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:46,320
Yeah, Judith Myers. Myers...

225
00:29:47,437 --> 00:29:49,651
"Row 18, plot 20."

226
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:51,136
Hm.

227
00:29:51,216 --> 00:29:54,712
Yeah, you know, you know, every town
has something like this happen.

228
00:29:55,612 --> 00:30:00,496
I remember over in Russellville,
old Charly Bowles, about 15 years ago.

229
00:30:01,076 --> 00:30:06,664
One night, he finished dinner,
and excused himself from the table.

230
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,522
And he went out to the garage.

231
00:30:09,902 --> 00:30:12,150
He got himself a hacksaw.

232
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,077
And then he went back into the house...

233
00:30:15,157 --> 00:30:18,430
...and he kissed his wife
and his two children goodbye...

234
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,634
- ...and then he proceeded...
- Where are we?

235
00:30:20,714 --> 00:30:24,132
Huh? Oh, it's right over here.

236
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:27,840
Yeah, Myers, Judith Myers. I remember her.

237
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,129
Couldn't believe it. Such a young boy.

238
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,155
What's the matter, are you lost?

239
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:38,055
Why do they do it? Goddamn kids.

240
00:30:39,865 --> 00:30:42,151
They'll do anything for Halloween.

241
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:45,858
- Whose grave is it?
- Oh, I don't know. Uh...

242
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,891
...eighteen, 19...

243
00:30:51,176 --> 00:30:53,019
...Judith Myers.

244
00:30:55,864 --> 00:30:57,916
He came home.

245
00:31:02,371 --> 00:31:06,295
- You still spooked?
- I wasn't spooked.

246
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:08,338
- Lies.
- I wasn't.

247
00:31:08,418 --> 00:31:10,482
I saw somebody standing
in Mr. Riddle's backyard.

248
00:31:10,562 --> 00:31:13,010
- Probably Mr. Riddle.
- He's watching me.

249
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,722
Mr. Riddle was watching you?
Laurie, Mr. Riddle is 87.

250
00:31:16,802 --> 00:31:19,703
- He can still watch.
- That's probably all he can do.

251
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:23,287
- What's the pumpkin for?
- I brought it for Tommy.

252
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:26,318
I figured carving a jack-o'-lantern
would keep him occupied.

253
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:29,213
I always said you'd make
a fabulous Girl Scout.

254
00:31:29,293 --> 00:31:30,280
Thanks.

255
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,117
And for that matter, I might as well
be a Girl Scout myself tonight.

256
00:31:33,197 --> 00:31:36,428
I plan on making popcorn
and watching Dr. Dementia.

257
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:38,805
Six straight hours of horror movies.

258
00:31:38,885 --> 00:31:41,725
Little Lindsey Wallace
won't know what hit her.

259
00:31:51,273 --> 00:31:53,971
My dad. Get rid of this.

260
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:06,224
Laurie, stop coughing.
What's the matter with you? Jesus.

261
00:32:06,304 --> 00:32:09,942
Just be natural. There he is.
Just be natural, Laurie.

262
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:16,789
Hi, Annie, Laurie.

263
00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:18,929
- Hi.
- Hi, Dad, what happened?

264
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:20,931
- What?
- What happened?

265
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:24,648
Oh, uh, somebody broke into
the hardware store. Probably kids.

266
00:32:24,728 --> 00:32:26,937
You blame everything on kids.

267
00:32:27,017 --> 00:32:31,108
All they took was some Halloween masks,
uh, rope, and a couple of knives.

268
00:32:31,188 --> 00:32:35,238
- Now, who do you think it was?
- It's hard growing up with a cynical father.

269
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:37,848
- Aren't you late...
- Huh?

270
00:32:37,928 --> 00:32:40,144
I said aren't you gonna be late?

271
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,108
He shouts too.

272
00:32:45,827 --> 00:32:47,252
Bye, girls.

273
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,868
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

274
00:32:57,214 --> 00:32:58,757
Sheriff?

275
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:02,264
Pardon me, I'm, uh, Loomis. Dr. Sam Loomis.

276
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:03,432
Uh, Lee Brackett.

277
00:33:03,512 --> 00:33:06,525
- I'd like to have a word with you if I could.
- Maybe a few minutes. I gotta take care...

278
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:08,395
It's important.

279
00:33:08,475 --> 00:33:11,169
- Ten minutes.
- I'll be here.

280
00:33:26,493 --> 00:33:28,498
What's the matter with you?

281
00:33:28,578 --> 00:33:30,667
I think he knew. I'm sure he could smell it.

282
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:34,487
- No, he didn't.
- Did. See the look on his face?

283
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:37,213
He always looks like that.

284
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:42,237
What are you gonna wear
to the dance tomorrow night?

285
00:33:42,317 --> 00:33:45,187
I didn't know you thought
about things like that, Laurie.

286
00:33:51,727 --> 00:33:54,107
- You know, you could ask somebody.
- Oh, I couldn't.

287
00:33:54,187 --> 00:33:57,469
Sure you could. All you have to do
is go up to somebody and say...

288
00:33:57,549 --> 00:33:59,905
"...You wanna go to the dance?"

289
00:33:59,985 --> 00:34:02,429
You could do that. I couldn't.

290
00:34:02,904 --> 00:34:06,398
Well, you could ask Dick Baxter.
He'd go out with you.

291
00:34:06,925 --> 00:34:09,244
I'd rather go out with Ben Tramer.

292
00:34:09,953 --> 00:34:12,026
Ben Tramer?

293
00:34:12,706 --> 00:34:14,750
I knew it.

294
00:34:15,624 --> 00:34:18,891
So you do think about things
like that, huh, Laurie?

295
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:21,802
- Shut up.
- He's cute.

296
00:34:21,882 --> 00:34:24,426
- Ben Tramer.
- Shh.

297
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,419
Okay.

298
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,166
<i>Trick or treat, trick or treat,
give me something good to eat</i>

299
00:35:34,246 --> 00:35:38,012
<i>Trick or treat, trick or treat,
give me something good to eat</i>

300
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:42,196
<i>Trick or treat, trick or treat,
give me something good to eat</i>

301
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:55,578
- Hi.
- Hi, Annie. Come on in.

302
00:35:59,396 --> 00:36:02,586
Uh, be in bed by 9, Lindsey, okay?
Have a good night, dear.

303
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:04,751
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

304
00:36:30,494 --> 00:36:34,142
- Does anybody live here?
- No, not since 1963, when it happened.

305
00:36:34,222 --> 00:36:36,728
Every kid in Haddonfield
thinks this place is haunted.

306
00:36:36,808 --> 00:36:38,677
They may be right.

307
00:36:56,369 --> 00:36:59,351
- Look.
- What? What is that?

308
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:01,666
It's a dog.

309
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:09,850
Still warm.

310
00:37:10,634 --> 00:37:12,711
He got hungry.

311
00:37:13,553 --> 00:37:16,017
Come on. Could've been a skunk.

312
00:37:16,097 --> 00:37:17,974
Could have.

313
00:37:18,725 --> 00:37:20,539
A man wouldn't do that.

314
00:37:21,019 --> 00:37:23,055
This isn't a man.

315
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,079
It happened in here.

316
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:03,562
She was sitting right here.

317
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:13,854
He could have seen her through this window.

318
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,910
Standing on the lawn,
he could have seen inside.

319
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:31,635
You must see me a very sinister doctor.

320
00:38:32,215 --> 00:38:35,494
Oh, I... I do have a permit.

321
00:38:37,654 --> 00:38:40,018
Seems to me you're just plain scared.

322
00:38:40,098 --> 00:38:42,696
Yes. Yeah, I am, uh...

323
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:48,318
...I met him 15 years ago.
I was told there was nothing left.

324
00:38:48,398 --> 00:38:52,155
No reason, no, uh, conscience,
no understanding...

325
00:38:52,235 --> 00:38:56,053
...in even the most rudimentary
sense, of life or death...

326
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:59,913
...of good or evil, of right or wrong.

327
00:38:59,993 --> 00:39:03,375
I met this 6-year-old child...

328
00:39:03,455 --> 00:39:08,229
...with this blank, pale, emotionless face...

329
00:39:08,309 --> 00:39:11,775
...and the blackest eyes.

330
00:39:12,355 --> 00:39:14,386
The devil's eyes.

331
00:39:15,066 --> 00:39:17,822
I spent eight years trying to reach him.

332
00:39:17,902 --> 00:39:21,157
And then another seven trying to
keep him locked up because I realized...

333
00:39:21,237 --> 00:39:26,684
...that what was living behind that boy's
eyes was purely and simply evil.

334
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:29,484
What do we do?

335
00:39:29,564 --> 00:39:31,778
He's been here once tonight.

336
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:33,738
I think he'll come back.

337
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:37,467
- I'm gonna wait for him.
- I think I should notify the radio and...

338
00:39:37,547 --> 00:39:41,079
No. If you do that,
they'll see him on every street corner...

339
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:45,020
...they'll look for him in every house. Just
tell your men to keep their mouths shut...

340
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,182
...and their eyes open.

341
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:51,203
I'll check back in an hour.

342
00:40:02,222 --> 00:40:06,604
"'How now,' cried Arthur.
'Let no one pass this way without a fight.'

343
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:10,442
'Is that so?,' said the night
in a bold and haughty manner."

344
00:40:10,522 --> 00:40:14,279
- I don't like that story.
- I thought King Arthur was your favorite.

345
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:16,369
Not anymore.

346
00:40:18,196 --> 00:40:22,203
- Why do you keep them under there?
- Mom doesn't like me to have them.

347
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:24,539
"Laser Man."

348
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:27,451
"Neutron Man." I can understand why.

349
00:40:27,831 --> 00:40:29,627
"Tarantula Man."

350
00:40:29,707 --> 00:40:32,522
Laurie, what's the boogeyman?

351
00:40:39,092 --> 00:40:41,892
- Doyle residence.
- <i>It's me.</i>

352
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:44,821
- Hi, Annie, what are you doing?
- <i>Making popcorn.</i>

353
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:49,164
Having fun? Never mind, I'm sure you are.

354
00:40:49,644 --> 00:40:52,943
I have big, big news for you.

355
00:40:54,823 --> 00:40:57,215
Oops. Hold on a minute.

356
00:40:58,611 --> 00:41:00,533
Hi, Lester.

357
00:41:00,613 --> 00:41:03,373
I'm about to be ripped apart
by the family dog.

358
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:13,029
Lindsey, get this dog
out of the kitchen right now.

359
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:27,643
I hate that dog. I'm the only person
in the world he doesn't like.

360
00:41:28,065 --> 00:41:30,695
So, what is this big, big news?

361
00:41:30,775 --> 00:41:34,042
What would you say if I told you that you
were going to the homecoming dance...

362
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:36,094
...tomorrow night?

363
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:37,991
I'd probably say you have the wrong number.

364
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,860
Well...

365
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:45,153
...I just talked with Ben Tramer
and he got real excited when I told him...

366
00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:47,399
...how attracted you were to him.

367
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:49,165
Oh, Annie.

368
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:53,454
Oh, you didn't. Please tell me you didn't.
How could you do that?

369
00:41:53,534 --> 00:41:55,631
I mean, how can you just call him...

370
00:41:56,211 --> 00:41:58,233
What do you mean it was easy?

371
00:41:58,713 --> 00:42:00,468
I can't believe this.

372
00:42:00,548 --> 00:42:02,551
I can't tell you anything.

373
00:42:03,018 --> 00:42:06,095
Every time I tell you something,
everyone else knows about it.

374
00:42:09,198 --> 00:42:12,419
Please tell me you didn't. Oh, you didn't.

375
00:42:13,478 --> 00:42:14,999
- Laurie.
- I'm so embarrassed.

376
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:17,610
- The boogeyman is outside.
- I couldn't even face him.

377
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,654
- Laurie, he's out there.
- Hold on.

378
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:22,387
Laurie, the boogeyman is outside. Look.

379
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:30,240
Tommy, there's nobody outside.

380
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,851
Go watch TV. It's just Tommy.

381
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:38,418
Oh, please, tell me you didn't.
How could you do that?

382
00:42:39,496 --> 00:42:42,402
Look, it's simple.
You like him, he likes you.

383
00:42:42,482 --> 00:42:44,772
All you need is a little push.

384
00:42:45,626 --> 00:42:50,098
Well, it won't hurt you to go out
with him, for God's sake... shit.

385
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:55,651
No, no, I just made a mess of myself.
I gotta call you back. Oh, yuck.

386
00:42:55,731 --> 00:42:58,998
Lindsey, I need a robe.

387
00:43:42,525 --> 00:43:47,589
Lindsey, Lester's barking again
and getting on my nerves again.

388
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:52,997
Oh, never mind.

389
00:43:53,077 --> 00:43:55,147
I guess he found a hot date.

390
00:44:43,186 --> 00:44:46,692
- What about the jack-o'-lantern?
- After the movie.

391
00:44:46,772 --> 00:44:50,154
- What about the rest of my comic books?
- After the jack-o'-lantern.

392
00:44:50,234 --> 00:44:53,891
- And what about the boogeyman?
- There's no such thing.

393
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:57,812
- Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
- Do you believe everything Richie tells you?

394
00:44:57,892 --> 00:44:59,847
No.

395
00:44:59,927 --> 00:45:03,735
Tommy, Halloween night, it's when
people play tricks on each other.

396
00:45:03,815 --> 00:45:06,471
It's all make-believe. I think
Richie was just trying to scare you.

397
00:45:06,551 --> 00:45:10,616
I saw the bogeyman. I saw him outside.

398
00:45:10,696 --> 00:45:13,369
- There was nobody outside.
- There was.

399
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:15,318
What did he look like?

400
00:45:15,785 --> 00:45:17,794
The bogeyman.

401
00:45:18,371 --> 00:45:20,385
We're not getting anywhere.

402
00:45:20,665 --> 00:45:23,921
All right. The bogeyman can only
come out on Halloween night, right?

403
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:25,882
- Right.
- Well, I'm here tonight.

404
00:45:25,962 --> 00:45:28,605
I'm not about to let anything happen to you.

405
00:45:29,106 --> 00:45:31,519
- Promise?
- Promise.

406
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,224
Can we make the jack-o'-lantern now?

407
00:45:35,363 --> 00:45:37,248
Let's go.

408
00:45:59,187 --> 00:46:01,005
Hmm, terrific.

409
00:46:18,306 --> 00:46:19,891
Hello?

410
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,935
Who's there?

411
00:46:24,445 --> 00:46:27,724
Paul, is this one of your cheap tricks?

412
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:33,045
Guess not.

413
00:46:33,821 --> 00:46:36,291
No tricks for Annie tonight.

414
00:46:51,756 --> 00:46:53,649
Come on.

415
00:46:53,925 --> 00:46:55,610
Lindsey!

416
00:46:56,427 --> 00:46:58,349
Lindsey, come out here.

417
00:46:58,429 --> 00:47:01,919
Lindsey, I'm in the laundry room.
The door won't open.

418
00:47:01,999 --> 00:47:05,557
<i>Spread out, everybody. We're gonna try
to figure out the shape of this thing.</i>

419
00:47:06,437 --> 00:47:10,878
- <i>Holy cats. Hey.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

420
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:13,240
<i>Almost a perfect...</i>

421
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,073
- <i>We finally got one.</i>
- <i>We found a flying saucer.</i>

422
00:47:18,157 --> 00:47:21,006
Oh, Lindsey, get the phone. It's Paul.

423
00:47:21,786 --> 00:47:24,025
Lindsey.

424
00:47:24,505 --> 00:47:26,575
Lindsey!

425
00:47:35,967 --> 00:47:38,570
Please, Paul, don't hang up.

426
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:46,849
<i>Oh, excellent.</i>

427
00:47:48,938 --> 00:47:51,336
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul.</i>

428
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:53,779
- <i>Is Annie there?</i>
- Yes, she is.

429
00:47:53,859 --> 00:47:57,241
- <i>Get her for me, will you?</i>
- She's washing her clothes.

430
00:47:57,321 --> 00:47:59,660
<i>Look, just tell her it's me, okay?</i>

431
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,317
Okay.

432
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,372
Annie, Paul called.

433
00:48:21,012 --> 00:48:23,815
- You locked yourself in.
- I know.

434
00:48:26,017 --> 00:48:28,486
Pull my foot. I'm stuck.

435
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:50,742
Now, promise me you won't tell
anybody about this.

436
00:49:09,226 --> 00:49:12,238
She got stuck in the window.
She'll be right here.

437
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,487
- Hello.
- <i>Hi, Annie.</i>

438
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:18,906
- Oh, hi, Paul.
- <i>Stuck, huh?</i>

439
00:49:18,986 --> 00:49:21,659
All right, cut it out.
It can happen to anyone.

440
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:23,411
<i>Sure, stuck in the window.</i>

441
00:49:23,491 --> 00:49:26,956
Yeah, but I've seen you stuck
in plenty of other positions.

442
00:49:27,036 --> 00:49:31,352
- <i>My parents are gone.</i>
- Oh, that's fabulous. When did they leave?

443
00:49:31,432 --> 00:49:34,919
- <i>About a half-hour ago.</i>
- Oh, utterly fantastic.

444
00:49:36,087 --> 00:49:39,135
- So why don't you just walk over?
- <i>You come and pick me up.</i>

445
00:49:39,215 --> 00:49:41,512
Oh, I can't come now.
My clothes are in the wash.

446
00:49:41,592 --> 00:49:44,223
- <i>You won't need them.</i>
- Oh, shut up, jerk.

447
00:49:44,303 --> 00:49:47,518
God, I've got a shirt on.
That's all you ever think about.

448
00:49:47,598 --> 00:49:51,355
- <i>I think that's all you ever think about.</i>
- That's no true. I think about lots of things.

449
00:49:51,435 --> 00:49:55,665
Why don't we not stand here talking
about them and get down to doing them?

450
00:49:56,424 --> 00:50:00,323
<i>Lock your doors, bolt your windows...</i>

451
00:50:00,403 --> 00:50:03,367
<i>...and turn off the lights.</i>

452
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:06,262
<i>Don't go away, because here's a scene from...</i>

453
00:50:06,342 --> 00:50:07,371
I'm scared.

454
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:09,749
Then why are you sitting here
with all the lights off?

455
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:11,667
- I don't know.
- Well, come on, get your coat.

456
00:50:11,747 --> 00:50:15,087
- We're going to pick up Paul.
- I don't want to.

457
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,923
Look, Lindsey, I thought
we understood each other.

458
00:50:18,003 --> 00:50:20,051
I wanna stay here and watch this.

459
00:50:20,131 --> 00:50:24,122
Okay. Well, if I can fix it so you
can watch TV with Tommy Doyle...

460
00:50:24,202 --> 00:50:25,997
- ...would you like that?
- Yeah.

461
00:50:26,077 --> 00:50:28,488
Well, come with me.

462
00:50:33,694 --> 00:50:35,732
Come on, hurry up.

463
00:51:04,842 --> 00:51:07,654
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi, come on in.

464
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:11,393
- We're making a jack-o'-lantern.
- You know, I wanna watch TV.

465
00:51:12,808 --> 00:51:15,550
- Annie, I'm in here.
- <i>Good. And now...</i>

466
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:18,609
<i>...the horrifying conclusion...</i>

467
00:51:18,689 --> 00:51:21,017
<i>...to The Thing.</i>

468
00:51:23,027 --> 00:51:26,682
- All fancy.
- This has not been my night.

469
00:51:28,449 --> 00:51:31,988
I spilled butter all over my clothes, they're
in the wash. I got stuck in the laundry...

470
00:51:32,068 --> 00:51:35,459
I'll tell you something. I'd like you to call
Ben Tramer and tell him that you were fooling.

471
00:51:35,539 --> 00:51:36,919
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

472
00:51:36,999 --> 00:51:40,131
No, he went drinking with Mike Godfrey
and he won't be back till late.

473
00:51:40,211 --> 00:51:42,800
You'll have to call him tomorrow.

474
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,526
Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.

475
00:51:46,342 --> 00:51:48,672
- Wait a minute.
- If you watch her...

476
00:51:48,752 --> 00:51:52,810
...I'll consider talking
to Ben Tramer in the morning.

477
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:54,446
Deal.

478
00:51:55,226 --> 00:51:58,733
- I thought Paul was grounded.
- He was. Old Jerk-o found a way to sneak out.

479
00:51:58,813 --> 00:52:01,277
Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so, okay?

480
00:52:01,357 --> 00:52:03,278
- Yeah.
- Bye.

481
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:05,044
Bye.

482
00:52:08,113 --> 00:52:10,563
The old Girl Scout comes through again.

483
00:52:23,337 --> 00:52:27,541
<i>My Paul, I give you all</i>

484
00:52:29,885 --> 00:52:32,180
<i>No keys</i>

485
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,956
<i>But please, my Paul</i>

486
00:53:05,863 --> 00:53:10,710
<i>Oh, Paul, I can no longer stall</i>

487
00:53:11,635 --> 00:53:13,599
<i>Oh, Paul</i>

488
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,922
<i>Oh, Paul, I can no longer stall</i>

489
00:53:19,502 --> 00:53:22,479
<i>Really, Paul</i>

490
00:53:24,195 --> 00:53:26,153
<i>My Paul</i>

491
00:54:22,106 --> 00:54:25,196
<i>Attention. Captain to crew,
stand by to reverse polarity.</i>

492
00:54:25,276 --> 00:54:29,341
<i>Standard class-A security
will be maintained upon landing.</i>

493
00:54:29,421 --> 00:54:33,098
<i>And until further notice, all hands
will wear sidearms. That is all.</i>

494
00:54:33,558 --> 00:54:35,590
- <i>Artificial gravity off.</i>
- <i>Aft locked.</i>

495
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:37,918
- <i>Cut primary coils.</i>
- <i>Primary's cut, sir.</i>

496
00:55:02,496 --> 00:55:04,059
Lindsey.

497
00:55:04,456 --> 00:55:06,112
Lindsey.

498
00:55:06,692 --> 00:55:08,752
Where are you?

499
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:35,856
Hey, it's the bogeyman. He's outside.

500
00:55:35,936 --> 00:55:38,567
The bogeyman's outside. There's the bogeyman.

501
00:55:38,647 --> 00:55:40,992
- What's wrong?
- I saw the boogeyman.

502
00:55:41,072 --> 00:55:44,842
- Tommy, stop it. You're scaring Lindsey.
- But I really saw him. He's over there...

503
00:55:44,922 --> 00:55:47,832
Tommy, stop it.
Now, there's nobody out there.

504
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:49,986
There's no bogeyman.
And if you don't stop all this...

505
00:55:50,066 --> 00:55:52,955
...I'm gonna turn off the TV
and send you to bed.

506
00:55:56,467 --> 00:55:58,956
Nobody believes me.

507
00:55:59,036 --> 00:56:01,072
I believe you, Tommy.

508
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:35,200
- I'm not afraid.
- Bull.

509
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,738
- I'm not.
- Then go in.

510
00:56:44,848 --> 00:56:47,785
- Chicken.
- Go ahead, Lonnie.

511
00:56:48,936 --> 00:56:50,787
Go in!

512
00:56:53,398 --> 00:56:54,946
Hey.

513
00:56:55,026 --> 00:56:58,695
Hey, Lonnie. Get your ass away from there.

514
00:57:08,439 --> 00:57:10,032
Oh.

515
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:12,463
Jesus.

516
00:57:12,543 --> 00:57:15,366
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

517
00:57:15,446 --> 00:57:19,094
Nothing's going on except kids
playing pranks, trick-or-treating...

518
00:57:19,174 --> 00:57:23,390
...parking, getting high. I have
the feeling that you're way off on this.

519
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:26,810
- You have the wrong feeling.
- You're not doing very much to prove me wrong.

520
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:30,397
- What more do you need?
- It's gonna take more than fancy talk...

521
00:57:30,477 --> 00:57:32,733
...to keep me up all night
crawling around these bushes.

522
00:57:32,813 --> 00:57:36,245
I watched him for 15 years,
sitting in a room...

523
00:57:36,325 --> 00:57:38,981
...staring at a wall, not seeing the wall...

524
00:57:39,061 --> 00:57:43,960
...looking past the wall, looking
at this night, inhumanly patient.

525
00:57:45,784 --> 00:57:50,593
Waiting for some secret silent alarm
to trigger him off.

526
00:57:51,373 --> 00:57:54,885
Death has come to your little town, sheriff.

527
00:57:54,965 --> 00:57:58,592
You can either ignore it
or you can help me to stop it.

528
00:57:58,672 --> 00:58:00,577
More fancy talk.

529
00:58:00,657 --> 00:58:02,579
Doctor, do you know what Haddonfield is?

530
00:58:02,659 --> 00:58:06,875
Families, children, all lined up
in rows up and down these streets.

531
00:58:06,955 --> 00:58:09,311
You're telling me they're lined up
for a slaughterhouse.

532
00:58:09,391 --> 00:58:11,226
They could be.

533
00:58:12,311 --> 00:58:16,735
All right, I'll stay with you tonight
just on the chance that you're right.

534
00:58:16,815 --> 00:58:21,401
And if you are right,
damn you for letting him go.

535
00:58:41,965 --> 00:58:45,789
Okay, so we're gonna... first we go inside,
right? Then we'll just talk a little.

536
00:58:45,869 --> 00:58:48,117
Then Annie will distract Lindsey,
that's when we go upstairs...

537
00:58:48,197 --> 00:58:50,501
...to the first bedroom on the left.
You got it?

538
00:58:50,581 --> 00:58:52,880
Okay, first I rip your clothes off.

539
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,399
No, don't rip my blouse.
It's expensive, idiot.

540
00:58:55,479 --> 00:58:58,193
Then you rip my clothes off.
Then we rip Lindsey's clothes off.

541
00:58:58,273 --> 00:59:00,958
- Yeah, I think I got it.
- Totally.

542
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:18,430
No, no.

543
00:59:20,629 --> 00:59:22,993
Bob, put me down.

544
00:59:23,073 --> 00:59:27,177
Put me down.
This is totally silly. Put me down.

545
00:59:30,305 --> 00:59:33,178
- Hey, it's totally dark.
- Yeah.

546
00:59:33,558 --> 00:59:36,840
Hey, Annie. Annie, we're here.

547
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,734
I wonder where they went.

548
00:59:38,814 --> 00:59:42,112
Oh, Annie probably took
Lindsey out for something.

549
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:53,319
- Hey, let's look for a note.
- Let's don't.

550
01:00:25,152 --> 01:00:27,449
Ooh...

551
01:00:27,529 --> 01:00:30,377
- He's gonna get you.
- No, he's not.

552
01:00:30,457 --> 01:00:33,694
Hey, nobody's getting anybody.
Stop scaring each other.

553
01:00:49,384 --> 01:00:51,841
Everybody's having a good time tonight.

554
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:55,644
- All right, you guys, what's next?
- Let's make more popcorn.

555
01:00:55,724 --> 01:00:58,522
No, we've had enough.
Why don't we watch the rest of the movie?

556
01:00:58,602 --> 01:01:00,845
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

557
01:01:10,989 --> 01:01:12,557
Oh.

558
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:20,377
- Doyle house.
- Hi, Laurie. What's up?

559
01:01:20,457 --> 01:01:23,354
<i>Uh, I'm just sitting down
for the first time tonight.</i>

560
01:01:23,802 --> 01:01:25,549
Hey, is Annie around?

561
01:01:25,629 --> 01:01:28,093
<i>No. I thought she'd be home by now.
She went to pick up Paul.</i>

562
01:01:28,173 --> 01:01:30,844
Well, she's totally not here.

563
01:01:32,035 --> 01:01:34,958
She probably stopped off someplace.
Have her call me when she gets home.

564
01:01:35,038 --> 01:01:38,025
I have Lindsey here and I wanna know
what time to put her to bed.

565
01:01:38,105 --> 01:01:40,480
Okay. Later.

566
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,604
- <i>Have a good time.</i>
- We definitely will.

567
01:01:44,589 --> 01:01:46,166
Bye.

568
01:01:47,818 --> 01:01:50,307
Lindsey is gone for the night.

569
01:01:50,387 --> 01:01:52,627
Hey, now that's wonderful.

570
01:02:35,866 --> 01:02:40,315
- Oh, shit. Not again.
- I can't help it. The phone keeps ringing.

571
01:02:40,395 --> 01:02:43,877
- Oh, and I can't keep you interested?
- Just answer the damn phone.

572
01:02:43,957 --> 01:02:48,362
Well, I can't. What if it's the Wallaces?
We'd get Annie in trouble, you know.

573
01:02:52,382 --> 01:02:54,585
We'll just take it off the hook.

574
01:03:27,751 --> 01:03:30,399
Oh, fantastic.

575
01:03:33,423 --> 01:03:36,293
- Totally.
- Yeah.

576
01:03:44,893 --> 01:03:47,157
- Want a beer?
- Yeah.

577
01:03:47,437 --> 01:03:50,474
- Is that all you can say?
- Yeah.

578
01:03:52,984 --> 01:03:56,032
- Go get me a beer.
- I thought you were gonna get me one.

579
01:03:56,112 --> 01:03:57,809
Yeah?

580
01:03:59,658 --> 01:04:03,298
I'll be right back. Don't get dressed.

581
01:04:59,301 --> 01:05:00,885
Annie?

582
01:05:01,678 --> 01:05:03,263
Paul?

583
01:05:06,416 --> 01:05:08,694
Lynda, you asshole.

584
01:05:13,023 --> 01:05:15,626
Okay, Lynda. Come on out.

585
01:06:18,365 --> 01:06:20,757
Well, did you get my beer?

586
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:29,466
Cute, Bob. Real cute.

587
01:06:41,386 --> 01:06:43,255
See anything you like?

588
01:06:50,895 --> 01:06:53,755
What's the matter?
Can't I get your ghost, Bob?

589
01:07:01,965 --> 01:07:04,467
All right, all right.
Come on, where's my beer?

590
01:07:10,332 --> 01:07:12,142
Well, can't you answer me?

591
01:07:16,212 --> 01:07:18,056
Okay, don't answer me.

592
01:07:19,049 --> 01:07:22,419
Boy, are you weird.
Well, I'm gonna call Laurie.

593
01:07:22,499 --> 01:07:26,540
I wanna know where Paul
and Annie are. This is going nowhere.

594
01:07:30,769 --> 01:07:32,429
Finally.

595
01:07:38,068 --> 01:07:39,116
Hello?

596
01:07:42,322 --> 01:07:43,849
Hello?

597
01:07:46,034 --> 01:07:50,462
All right, Annie. First, I get your famous
chewing, now I get your famous squealing?

598
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:56,678
Annie, are you all right?

599
01:08:06,346 --> 01:08:08,348
Are you fooling around again?

600
01:08:09,683 --> 01:08:11,524
I'll kill you if this is a joke.

601
01:08:12,368 --> 01:08:13,904
<i>Annie?</i>

602
01:08:16,398 --> 01:08:17,540
<i>Annie?</i>

603
01:09:06,923 --> 01:09:08,792
Sleep tight, kids.

604
01:12:19,615 --> 01:12:21,200
Bob?

605
01:12:21,768 --> 01:12:23,292
Lynda?

606
01:12:31,076 --> 01:12:32,635
Lynda?

607
01:12:43,806 --> 01:12:45,368
Annie?

608
01:13:02,808 --> 01:13:04,380
Annie?

609
01:13:07,188 --> 01:13:08,698
Lynda?

610
01:13:10,733 --> 01:13:12,318
Bob?

611
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:29,444
All right, Annie.

612
01:13:54,185 --> 01:13:56,463
All right, meatheads. Joke's over.

613
01:14:00,867 --> 01:14:03,503
Come on, Annie. It's enough.

614
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,310
This most definitely stopped
being funny. Now, cut it out.

615
01:14:13,396 --> 01:14:15,198
You'll be sorry.

616
01:17:01,589 --> 01:17:03,474
Oh, God.

617
01:17:25,897 --> 01:17:28,191
Oh. No.

618
01:17:39,502 --> 01:17:41,087
Help.

619
01:17:47,918 --> 01:17:49,332
No.

620
01:17:53,908 --> 01:17:57,957
Help! Somebody help me, please!

621
01:17:58,037 --> 01:17:59,942
Somebody help!

622
01:18:00,022 --> 01:18:02,270
Oh, God, help me!

623
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:05,832
Please! Please help me!

624
01:18:07,963 --> 01:18:09,677
Help!

625
01:18:10,257 --> 01:18:12,722
Oh, God, help me, please!

626
01:18:12,802 --> 01:18:15,455
Hello! Hello!

627
01:18:17,665 --> 01:18:19,478
Hello, help me!

628
01:18:19,558 --> 01:18:22,607
Can you please help me? Please!

629
01:18:23,187 --> 01:18:25,192
Can't you hear me?

630
01:18:25,272 --> 01:18:27,236
Oh, God.

631
01:18:29,693 --> 01:18:31,921
Help me, please!

632
01:18:43,524 --> 01:18:46,962
The keys. Oh, the keys.

633
01:18:51,907 --> 01:18:53,480
Tommy!

634
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,229
Tommy, it's me!

635
01:18:58,164 --> 01:18:59,392
Tommy!

636
01:19:08,441 --> 01:19:10,983
- Who is it?
- Tommy, open up, it's me!

637
01:19:11,063 --> 01:19:14,029
- Yeah, okay.
- Tommy, please!

638
01:19:15,222 --> 01:19:19,074
Tommy, hurry up! Tommy, please!

639
01:19:20,062 --> 01:19:21,590
Tommy!

640
01:19:22,170 --> 01:19:25,230
Hurry up! Tommy, please!

641
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:26,796
- Tommy, get upstairs.
- What is it?

642
01:19:26,876 --> 01:19:29,807
Get upstairs, get Lindsey,
lock the bedroom door. Do as I say.

643
01:19:29,887 --> 01:19:32,156
- The bogeyman...
- Hurry!

644
01:19:43,934 --> 01:19:45,464
Oh, no.

645
01:20:00,534 --> 01:20:03,413
Please stop. Please.

646
01:21:18,337 --> 01:21:22,244
- Where were you? I went to the Myers' house...
- I found the car. He's here.

647
01:21:22,324 --> 01:21:23,646
- Where?
- He's three blocks down.

648
01:21:23,726 --> 01:21:26,690
You go around the back of the houses.
I'll watch the front.

649
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:28,906
- Go on.
- All right.

650
01:21:58,235 --> 01:22:00,721
Tommy? Lindsey?

651
01:22:02,223 --> 01:22:03,758
Babies.

652
01:22:07,536 --> 01:22:10,868
- We're gonna take a little walk.
- Was it the bogeyman?

653
01:22:10,948 --> 01:22:13,462
- I'm scared.
- There's nothing to be scared of.

654
01:22:13,542 --> 01:22:15,369
Are you sure?

655
01:22:16,378 --> 01:22:17,967
How?

656
01:22:18,047 --> 01:22:19,843
I killed him.

657
01:22:19,923 --> 01:22:22,126
You can't kill the bogeyman.

658
01:22:25,579 --> 01:22:28,619
Get in there. Come on, Tommy.
Now lock the door.

659
01:25:06,548 --> 01:25:09,222
Tommy, unlock the door.

660
01:25:12,579 --> 01:25:15,991
Come here. Now, just listen to me.

661
01:25:16,725 --> 01:25:19,757
I want you to go down the stairs
and out the front door.

662
01:25:19,837 --> 01:25:22,384
I want you to go down the street
to the Mackenzies' house.

663
01:25:22,464 --> 01:25:26,530
I want you to tell them to call the police
and tell them to send them over here.

664
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:28,724
- Laurie...
- Now, do you understand me?

665
01:25:28,804 --> 01:25:30,631
Go, do as I say.

666
01:25:51,410 --> 01:25:54,414
Come on! Get help! Come on.

667
01:25:54,494 --> 01:25:56,035
Come on!

668
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:21,767
Was that the bogeyman?

669
01:27:27,089 --> 01:27:30,150
As a matter of fact, it was.
