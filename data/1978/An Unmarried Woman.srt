1
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:18,765
Jesus Christ! Look at this.
My sneaker's ruined!

2
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:23,741
- They're only $35.
- Fucking city's turned into
one big pile of dog shit!

3
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:30,882
Come on out and take a crap on me!
Everybody else is! Fuck.

4
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,817
- Give it back to the poodles.
- What's the point of jogging
for two and a half miles?

5
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,820
Giving yourself lung cancer.

6
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,981
Tell you somethin', Erica.
The longer I'm married to you...

7
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,355
the more you sound like my mother.

8
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,122
Clean your own sneaker.

9
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,864
- You wanted me to step in it.
- You're going crazy, Martin.

10
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,701
- Yeah?
- Yes.

11
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,993
Why would I want you to step in dog shit?

12
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,398
Well, that's a good question.

13
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:28,105
- Oh, God.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

14
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,467
I'm not your mother.

15
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,012
- You know.
- Yeah.

16
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,673
Listen, do you think we got time
for a little quickie?

17
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:40,446
I got about 11 minutes.

18
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,113
Hey, come on!

19
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:47,284
Gimme a break here.
I'm gettin' frostbite.

20
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,534
Jesus, I got to quit smoking.

21
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:01,733
- I saw Jacobs on Tuesday. Did I tell you?
- Uh-uh.

22
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,901
Yeah, I went in
for my annual physical.

23
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,104
How are you?

24
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,113
Fine.

25
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,115
You sound surprised.

26
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:13,481
Well, you know,
I go up there for the damn thing...

27
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:18,080
and my blood pressure goes up 20 points
from the anxiety of having to take the exam.

28
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,661
- What are you doing today?
- Working at the gallery.

29
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,696
Oh, yeah.

30
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,163
<i>Goin'to school.</i>

31
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,637
- Hi.
- Hi.

32
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,834
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

33
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,810
Hmm.
Did the earth move?

34
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,386
Bye.

35
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,786
I'm telling you,
we expose that kid to too much.

36
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,859
- Well, we still lock the door.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:11,107
- Have a good time. See you tonight.
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:30,155
"Tonight, the ballet worid
was introduced...

39
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,289
"to a brilliant new talent—

40
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:38,234
"the long-awaited debut
of Erica Benton.

41
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,436
"Miss Benton astounded
the ballet worid last night...

42
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:49,413
in her incredible
performance of <i>Swan Lake. "</i>

43
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,997
"Her <i>pas de deux</i>
were breathtaking."

44
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,490
- Hello.
- Hi.

45
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,404
There she is.

46
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,835
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

47
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,907
- You look great.
- Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

48
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,600
You're just in time for some big news.

49
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,611
- Well.
- Oh, hi. Uhhh.

50
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,580
- Wine.
- Let's have a glass— another carafe. Okay?

51
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,208
- Yeah. And, uh...
- Anything else?

52
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,651
- Steamer Vic.
- Refills for everybody.

53
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:39,282
<i>- Are you ready?</i>
- You're in love.

54
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,656
Would that I were.
It's not my news.

55
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,696
- Sue.
- The only thing that happened
to me last week was...

56
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,992
my elevator man
got arrested for flashing.

57
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,466
- What is it, Jeannette?
- I met a man.

58
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,538
Well, that's terrific!

59
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,868
- Well, there's a little problem.
- He's married.

60
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,033
No.

61
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,043
- He's very young.
- You're not close.

62
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,477
- How young?
- He's 19.

63
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,913
- Oh, Jesus.
- I know. I know.

64
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,075
- He's very mature.
- Nineteen?

65
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:09,052
The problem is: Does she fuck him,
or does she adopt him?

66
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:14,525
I'm a terrible person. I'm drunk,
and I'm giddy, and I'm going to the loo.

67
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,095
- Sorry, Jeannette.
- It's okay.

68
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,187
I think Elaine's
going through early menopause.

69
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,392
It is so ironic. I've dated so many men...

70
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,268
in the last few years
that were my age or older...

71
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:30,399
and Steven— his name is Steven—

72
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,479
is the first man that I've really liked...

73
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,707
- since my divorce.
- Well, what's he like?

74
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:41,344
He's calm, quiet.
He doesn't come on.

75
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:45,447
He's very bright.
He's not afraid to be tender.

76
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,789
Well, if you were a man and you
were talking about a 19-year-old girl...

77
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,795
then there would be
no problem, would there?

78
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,229
No, I worry about Teddy.

79
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:57,029
I mean, how do you tell a six-year-old child
his new daddy is a teenager?

80
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,602
- Where does he live now?
- With his parents.

81
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,699
Maybe I <i>should</i> adopt him.

82
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,710
Did I miss anything?

83
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,746
No.

84
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,508
It's just that last night was so incredible.

85
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:17,555
I put Teddy to bed,
and Steven came over.

86
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,353
We just sat and talked
all night long.

87
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,087
- I mean, till 7:00 this morning.
- What did you talk about?

88
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:26,187
We talked a lot about loneliness.

89
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:30,292
- Got kind of emotional.
- Then?

90
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,928
- Promise you won't laugh?
- I promise.

91
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:38,807
Well, then he undressed me,
and he gave me a massage.

92
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:44,781
And it was the most incredible
experience I think I've ever had in my life.

93
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:48,081
- I'll bet.
- Was it sexual?

94
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:50,655
That's it. It was and it wasn't.

95
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,816
I mean,
he massaged my feet and my toes...

96
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,384
<i>and he massaged my fingers.</i>

97
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,430
<i>He massaged my eyes.</i>

98
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,194
<i>He actually massaged my eyes.</i>

99
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:06,294
And then I had an orgasm.

100
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,135
And then another
and then another.

101
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,641
I'd say it was sexual.

102
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,439
There ain't nothin' wrong with a good,
old-fashioned eyeball orgasm.

103
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:20,076
Oh, I love them. I mean,
I couldn't live without them.

104
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,416
- Have you read the latest book?
- No, I didn't.

105
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,957
- You think I'm going crazy.
- Crazy? What's this boy's phone number?

106
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,049
- Don't be offended, okay?
- No. What? What?

107
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,355
- Is he being honest with you?
- That's pretty naive, Erica.

108
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,521
- No, it isn't.
- No, it's not.

109
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,531
There's no such thing
as total honesty...

110
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,533
not with men.

111
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,694
They're all wrapped up in sexual ego.

112
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,795
- What the hell is sexual ego, Elaine?
- Never getting enough.

113
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,034
Always on the make.
Constantly worried about performing.

114
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,738
That's ridiculous. I know lots of men who
are interested in other things besides sex.

115
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,747
<i>- Name one.</i>
- My husband.

116
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:56,045
Harold hasn't made a pass in six months.

117
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,784
Well, listen, Elaine. Don't you think
you're taking this thing a little too far?

118
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,416
Me? No.

119
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,519
- I think you're getting to be a man-hater.
- I love men!

120
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,825
We're talking about their honesty.

121
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:10,629
- Do you think Martin is totally honest?
- I don't think about it.

122
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,364
I think Erica has the second-best man
in the five boroughs.

123
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,372
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, I'm sure.

124
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:18,807
I think what I'm gonna do is just go along
with things the way they are...

125
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,937
- and just see what happens.
- Have fun, honey.

126
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:25,040
The worst that can happen
is that it'll end.

127
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,712
No, I think the worst that could happen
is that his parents will find out.

128
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:33,315
You're fabulous.

129
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,259
- I love you.
- Swiftly moving on.

130
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,152
Patti?

131
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,891
Hello?

132
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,295
Hi.

133
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:16,962
- Giris had a long meeting tonight, huh?
- They're not meetings.

134
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,368
- What's on the news?
- Nothin'.

135
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:24,705
They're shootin' up Rhodesia,
and, uh, the garbagemen are
raisin' hell again. You know.

136
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,371
Jeannette is having an affair
with a 19-year-old boy.

137
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,779
Oh, shit. She's flipped.

138
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,942
Men go out with younger women
all the time.

139
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,953
Nineteen is four years
older than Patti.

140
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,285
Yeah, where is Patti?

141
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,654
She went to the movies with Phil.

142
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:47,398
- I like Phil.
- Well, maybe Phil should meetJeannette.

143
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,628
- Martin.
- How are Elaine and Sue?

144
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:55,435
- Fine.
<i>- Elaine makes me very nervous.</i>

145
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,102
- She likes you.
- Yeah.

146
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,441
I like her all right.
She just comes on too strong.

147
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,038
So do you sometimes.

148
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,483
Sometimes I get the feeling that you
prefer Elaine and Sue and Jeannette to me.

149
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,679
That's ridiculous, Martin.

150
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:14,290
- Do you?
- Sometimes.

151
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,566
Look, Martin. Patti's coming home.

152
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:37,644
I have to get up early.

153
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,853
Martin, I'm not in the mood.

154
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,718
You give me a headache.

155
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,987
- Take an aspirin.
- Shit.

156
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,889
<i>Anybody home?</i>

157
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,900
<i>We're in here, honey.</i>

158
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,163
What's goin' on in there?

159
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,603
Want me to go out
and come in again?

160
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,543
- Hi.
- Hi.

161
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,342
- Hi.
- Hi.

162
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,316
- How was the movie?
- Good. We saw the new Lina Wertmüller film.

163
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,547
- Yeah? Did you like it?
- I loved it.

164
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,555
But Phil thought it was flawed.

165
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,888
How old is Phil again?

166
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,259
You know how old he is. Why?

167
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:30,028
Well, your mother's friend Jeannette
is having an affair with a 19-year-old guy.

168
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:33,400
- Good for her.
- Yeah?

169
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,531
- Would Phil go out with Jeannette?
- I don't know.

170
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,803
You'd have to ask Phil.

171
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,776
Don't say anything
aboutJeannette.

172
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,350
Who am I gonna tell?

173
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,978
- You and Daddy fighting?
- No, it's not a fight.

174
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:53,115
- Daddy doesn't look too happy.
- Mmm!

175
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,125
- Good night.
- Good night.

176
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,371
Jesus.

177
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,166
You're acting like a five-year-old kid.

178
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:15,676
- I know. I know.
- It's wonderful when you're
in the mood and I'm in mood.

179
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,909
But, God!

180
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:22,078
It's not much fun when you
make me feel like it's an obligation.

181
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:25,088
I know. You're right. I'm sorry.

182
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,090
Besides, we had sex this morning.

183
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,025
What do you want?

184
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,462
Guess I'm not much fun
to live with, am I?

185
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,336
Are you okay?

186
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,772
- I don't know.
- What is it?

187
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,806
I don't know. I just...

188
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,680
find myself—

189
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:57,278
I just— I'm anxious all the time, you know.

190
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,085
About what?

191
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,252
I just— I'm fantasizing and—

192
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,820
- About what?
- Uhh.

193
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,264
About changing my life.

194
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,534
Quit Wall Street, go be
a disc jockey somewhere. I don't know.

195
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,666
- Tired of your job?
- I'll tell you something.

196
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,676
I've been the takeover type all my life.

197
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,679
I mean, in school, in the navy...

198
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,874
probably with you,
certainly with Patti.

199
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,646
- There's nothing wrong
with being a strong man.
- That's the point.

200
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,779
- I'm not a strong man.
I don't feel like a strong man.
- You are!

201
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:34,222
Well, I feel tired.

202
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,226
I don't know what to say.

203
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,353
You should see a psychiatrist.

204
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:43,026
Really.

205
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,569
I- I don't think so.

206
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,435
<i>Is it me? Are you tired of me?</i>

207
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,444
I love you.

208
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,588
Aww.

209
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,092
I'd hate to join the crowd.

210
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,690
Why? What do you mean?

211
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,260
Oh, Elaine's boozing a lot.

212
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,602
Jeannette's crazy.

213
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,268
Sue's okay. She's a strong woman.

214
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,902
- God.
- Well, so are you.

215
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,504
I'm beginning to wonder about me.

216
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,742
Oh, it's so nice
to have a man to come home to.

217
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,386
- Is that just luck?
- Yeah.

218
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,985
It's luck and a fabulous body.

219
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:19,654
Jesus. Here, three kids in the sixth grade
beat their teacher up.

220
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,495
Where?

221
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,570
The Bronx.

222
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,868
- You never have any trouble
in school, do you?
- No.

223
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,203
It's a jungle.

224
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,906
It is! They got guys carrying guns.

225
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,312
Oh, you read too much.

226
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,682
- I what?
- It doesn't really happen that way.

227
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,484
Well, it doesn't happen where
you go to school, because we
got you in a pretty good school.

228
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:49,083
- It's costing me a lot of money.
- Oh, I'll go to public school.

229
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,492
- Okay. You're on.
- Okay.

230
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,498
<i>- You think that's funny?</i>

231
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,297
- We'll buy you a gun,
send you to public school.
- I'm sorry.

232
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:02,237
I'm getting tickets to the ballet
a week from Friday. Do you want to go?

233
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,969
- I don't know. Let me ask Phil.
- Phil can come with us.

234
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,977
Only if he pays.

235
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,242
- I don't think Phil likes ballet.
- I don't either. I'm goin'.

236
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,579
Good for your soul.

237
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,709
No. I think I'll pass, Mom.

238
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:22,025
- Listen, am I a nagging father?
- No.

239
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,561
You're just feeling
the loss of separation.

240
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,654
I'm not your little girl anymore.

241
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,165
Wash your mouth with soap!

242
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,032
- Hey, no physical contact, please!
- Got to go.

243
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:35,231
- Bye.
- Bye.

244
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,641
Bye.

245
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,248
Do you think Daddy's
worried about getting old?

246
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,877
- Are you taking a psych course this year?
- Mm-hmm.

247
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:53,185
He's always joking. Never seems
to take anything seriously, you know.

248
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,090
You mean, he doesn't take Phil seriously,
and that bothers you.

249
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,164
No, it doesn't.
I don't take Phil that seriously either.

250
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,494
Oh, I think
you're serious about Phil.

251
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:10,970
Mom, I'm still a virgin,
if that's what you meant.

252
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:13,738
It's not what I meant.
But I'm glad you told me.

253
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,042
- I just meant that you like Phil.
- I like Phil.

254
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,277
I'm not gonna marry him.
I'm never getting married.

255
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,553
- You will.
- Don't be so sure.

256
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,749
- Why not?
- Why should I?

257
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,019
Everybody I know who's married
is either miserable or divorced.

258
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,220
- I don't want that.
- Oh, Patti. That's ridiculous!

259
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,096
- There's a lot of happily married couples.
- Name three.

260
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,259
- Uhh.
- Uh.

261
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,360
- I'll have to think about it.
- Yeah.

262
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,371
See you later.

263
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,373
383 West Broadway, please.

264
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,102
Now, if all this stuff
wasn't done by a woman...

265
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,577
I don't think you could sit
in the same room with it.

266
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,740
It isn't "stuff," Charlie.
It happens to be art.

267
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,977
You're a classic
male chauvinist pig.

268
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,610
I know, but I'm cute.

269
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:33,350
- You're out of style, Charlie.
- Want a bite?

270
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,426
Uh-uh.

271
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:38,087
You're a beautiful woman, Erica.

272
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,393
- But you're leading such a sheltered life.
- How can you tell?

273
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,699
It's in your eyes. You can tell
everything in a woman's eyes.

274
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,535
Oh. Can you tell
everything in a man's eyes?

275
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:53,133
Men cover it up.
Women lay it all on the line.

276
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,475
Right there in the old eyes.

277
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,844
What do you see
in my eyes, Charlie?

278
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,919
- Want me to be honest?
- Yeah.

279
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:08,789
You're not gettin' enough.

280
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,862
I think you ought to have
your eyes examined.

281
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:14,591
Oh, no.
No, you're not really satisfied.

282
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,261
I mean, your old man's
okay and all that, but, uh...

283
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,338
underneath it all
you're frustrated.

284
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,738
Go paint a still life, Charlie.

285
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,334
- You ever had an affair?
- It's none of your business.

286
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,574
Oh, man.
What a shame. What a waste!

287
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:34,641
A woman as beautiful as you should
be tasting a little variety in life.

288
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:37,221
Imagine if all you ever ate was apples?

289
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:41,418
<i>Imagine never tasting</i>
<i>a peach or a pear? Apapaya?</i>

290
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,222
Huh? No way, babe.
Same thing with sex.

291
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:48,288
I'm allergic to papayas, Charlie.

292
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,566
How about a nice, fresh guava? Huh?

293
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,835
- Huh?
- Leave me alone.

294
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,809
- Don't you ever think about
anything else, Charlie?
- Yeah, like what?

295
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:03,574
Ohh, there's
literature and ballet...

296
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,582
- and theater and dance...
- Hey, hey, hey, Erica.

297
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,584
- And architecture—
- Erica. Hey, listen.

298
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,711
There's work, there's food,
and there's sex.

299
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,812
That's the whole ball game.

300
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,090
Rowan Gallery.

301
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:20,323
Yeah. Sure.

302
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:24,630
Yeah. I'll meet you.
Um, 15 minutes.

303
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,261
Okay, honey. Bye.

304
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,234
Might I inquire
as to who "honey" is?

305
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:34,244
My husband.
I'm meeting him for lunch.

306
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,449
Well...

307
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:44,954
- think I'll hit the streets for awhile.
- Bye, Charlie.

308
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,456
- Hi.
<i>- Is this together?</i>

309
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,995
Uh, yeah, he's paying for me.

310
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:58,531
That'll be $3.95.

311
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,577
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

312
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,518
Excuse me.

313
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,127
Mmm, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

314
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,927
I think that if we're gonna go
to the island this summer...

315
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,002
that we really ought
to get on it right away.

316
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:34,902
How would you feel about sharing a place
with Sue and Harold?

317
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,011
- How's the market?
- Huh?

318
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:44,141
Just wanted to see if you
were paying any attention to me.

319
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:50,145
- You want to share a place
with Sue and Harold.
- Think you could handle it?

320
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,189
- Yeah.
<i>- Okay.</i>

321
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:56,522
<i>Well, I'll talk to Sue, and maybe the four</i>
<i>of us could drive out in a couple of weeks.</i>

322
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,859
We really should get on it right away.

323
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,661
Jesus, it's gonna be even
more expensive this year.

324
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,472
You know, if we do take a place...

325
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:11,235
we're gonna have to have
my club up there.

326
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:15,109
I could just see us,
all lying in the sun, blabbing away.

327
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:18,046
I mean, we would—
We talk. We really do.

328
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,081
I love our meetings.

329
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,452
They're so— I don't know.

330
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,650
I just love them.

331
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,784
It's sort of like
a continuing story, you know.

332
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:35,026
It's part <i>Mary Hartman</i>
and part Ingmar Bergman.

333
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,432
L— I love the women.

334
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,872
Marty. Marty. Come on.

335
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,876
What is it, honey?

336
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:50,744
What's the matter?

337
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,749
What is it?

338
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:58,885
- Th—What? Tell me!
- I'm in love with somebody else.

339
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:03,393
I've been seeing another woman...

340
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,759
for over a year.

341
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:09,664
<i> And at first, you know,</i>
<i>I thought it was just a</i>—<i>a fling.</i>

342
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,134
<i>But it isn't. I love her.</i>

343
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,137
<i>I want to live with her.</i>

344
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:21,275
Oh, God. I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want to hurt Patti.

345
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:25,281
But l—

346
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,283
I can't—

347
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,580
You don't know her or anything.

348
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,656
Her name is Marcia Brenner.

349
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,589
She's a— She's a teacher.

350
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,684
She's, uh, 26.

351
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:41,255
I met her— I met her
at Bloomingdale's, for Christ's sake.

352
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,960
I was standing there
buying a shirt, you know.

353
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,333
And she, uh—

354
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,168
She was standing next to me.

355
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,174
She asked me, uh...

356
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,768
if I liked the shirt that, uh,
she was buying for her father.

357
00:26:56,448 --> 00:27:00,976
<i>Oh, God.</i>
<i> I'm so sorry.</i>

358
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:07,687
You tell Patti—
You tell Patti that you're sorry.

359
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,927
I'm in love with her.

360
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,030
Ohhh.

361
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:22,036
- She a good lay?
- Oh, she—

362
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,665
The first thing we have to do
is get you a good lawyer.

363
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:57,257
I just can't believe it.

364
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,268
I really liked Martin.

365
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,601
- This is not a time to pity Martin.
- I am not pitying Martin.

366
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,175
Move fast, Erica.
Don't let the thing drag on.

367
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,710
That's what I did.
It just hurts more and more.

368
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,610
- Get it over with.
- I don't agree with you.

369
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,615
There's nothing to talk about.

370
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:15,208
The son of a bitch walked out
on a magnificent woman.

371
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,948
The son of a bitch may walk
right back in in a month or two.

372
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,183
It sounds to me
like this thing's just sexual.

373
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:23,454
Would you take Harold back
if he told you he was having an affair?

374
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:27,759
Oh, hon, Harold has affairs.
He doesn't tell me about 'em.

375
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,198
I don't give a damn,
as long as we respect each other.

376
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,394
That's kind of
a weird contradiction, isn't it?

377
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:36,531
- My marriage isn't based on a king-sized bed.
- Neither was mine.

378
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:40,236
I know it wasn't.
There was a lot of love there.

379
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,314
That's why I'd hate to see it wasted
if there's any hope.

380
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:46,747
- There's no hope.
- You want him back?

381
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,479
Would you take that
miserable bastard back?

382
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:52,385
No.

383
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,290
- I don't think so.
- "Think"? You have doubts?

384
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,362
- Of course, she has doubts.
- Look, all I know is...

385
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,899
I feel completely and totally alone.

386
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,595
- That'll pass.
- Not if she sits on it, it won't.

387
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:08,331
Depression has a way
of getting nice and comfortable.

388
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,737
There are days
I really enjoy my black moods.

389
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:13,606
- It's like curling up
with a good detective story.
- Merde.

390
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:16,145
How would you know
if you were never there?

391
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:20,206
Hey, honey, these old bones
have known plenty of misery.

392
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:24,812
But I make it a point to get busy
as soon as I feel the blues comin' on.

393
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,556
Oh, God.
It was so much easier in the '60s.

394
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,323
We had Vietnam,
assassinations, the Black Panthers.

395
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,921
There was a hell of a lot to do.

396
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,662
Can even find a decent cause these days.

397
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,034
We could use a good war.

398
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,108
I could use a double vodka martini.

399
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:48,339
- Patti's so sad.
- She has a right to be. So do you.

400
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,043
I'm sad, Elaine.

401
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,381
I'm sad. I'm lonely.
I'm depressed.

402
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,681
What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to say?

403
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,121
Where you goin'?

404
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,620
See you guys next week.

405
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,094
Well, let me ride home with you.

406
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,997
- You sure you're all right?
- I'll call you later.

407
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:17,236
I think we made her
feel worse than she did.

408
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,175
I don't think
that marriage is over yet.

409
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,736
I hope Martin gets a permanent case
of the clap and his pecker falls off.

410
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,655
- Hello.
- Fuck you.

411
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,430
- Hi.
- Hi.

412
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,973
I had a fight with Phil.

413
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:57,241
What about?

414
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,714
He was defending Daddy.

415
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:02,650
He doesn't think it was the right thing,
but he understands him.

416
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,813
Phil's a nice boy.

417
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,450
- I hate Daddy.
- He didn't leave you. He left me.

418
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,393
I still hate him.

419
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,624
You'll get over it.

420
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,331
I don't want to see him again.

421
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,206
Who you talkin' about—
Phil or your daddy?

422
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:30,077
- Both of'em.
- That's crazy.

423
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,911
Then I'm crazy.

424
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:39,354
Okay, honey.

425
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,519
Oh, Mom.

426
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,430
- I hate him, Mom.
- Oh.

427
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:54,704
I hate him too.

428
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,811
Would you take him back?

429
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,747
Do you want him to come back?

430
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:14,086
Yeah. I guess so.

431
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:18,561
It's over, kiddo.

432
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,427
For good.

433
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:24,262
You'd better
get used to that, you know?

434
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,840
<i>- Hello?</i>

435
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,605
Hello, Phil.

436
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:39,349
No.

437
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:44,853
Yes<i>. Star Wars.</i> Mm-hmm.

438
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,924
No. Nothin'. Nothin'.

439
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,493
I thought we went over this?

440
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,391
Mm-hmm.

441
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,915
"Balls," said the queen.
"If I had 'em, I'd be king."

442
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:25,086
Well, if you won't sue me, Erica...

443
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:28,097
I'll tell you, uh, off the record...

444
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,292
that you're in very good health.

445
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,495
- Why am I tired all the time?
- It's called divorce.

446
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:36,129
Maybe I should take Valium
or something.

447
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,265
Come on.
We'll talk about it. Huh?

448
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:49,014
- Did you feel this way, uh,
before all this happened?
- Never.

449
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,920
- Never?
- Maybe I should see a psychiatrist, Arthur.

450
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:57,723
Erica, it's normal to feel lousy
when a husband walks out on you.

451
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,965
You'd have to be crazy to feel good.

452
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,194
It's only been a few weeks.

453
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,999
Some time has to pass.

454
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,507
- And I'm not saying you
shouldn't see a psychiatrist.
- You're just saying...

455
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:16,137
- Erica's in good health.
- Mmm.

456
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,340
Are you—
Are you seeing other men yet?

457
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,917
No!

458
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,782
<i>Well, don't be so shocked.</i>

459
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,015
I'm not in the mood
for men, Arthur.

460
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:30,322
I wasn't referring to sex.
I mean, companionship.

461
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,328
Oh. Oh.

462
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,557
There are male companions
out there who don't wanna get laid?

463
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:37,998
Well, you—
Well, you could have a drink with me.

464
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:42,402
Is that a pass, Arthur?

465
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,203
No, it was an invitation
to have a drink.

466
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:49,211
How come I never got an invitation
to have a drink when I was married?

467
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,248
Well, I don't know.
L— I never thought about it.

468
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,818
It's a pass, Arthur.

469
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,080
A definite fucking pass.

470
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:02,234
My relationship
with Hal is totally honest.

471
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,241
He doesn't tell me he loves me.
I don't tell him he's fascinating.

472
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,436
- It's pure sex.
- You always were different.

473
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,445
Not always.

474
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:12,516
- I've just learned to live
with my ups and downs.
- I don't know how you do it.

475
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:16,347
I like my job.
I like my friends.

476
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:20,754
I like my holidays.
Oh, I'm going to the Catskills next week!

477
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,190
There's a new swami in town.
You wanna go?

478
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:27,025
Uh, well, my spiritual life is just fine.

479
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,258
What's spiritual?
There'll be some gorgeous men there.

480
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:34,304
- What does this Bob do?
- He's a press agent—
Broadway shows, movies.

481
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:37,033
Hal says he's a nice guy.

482
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:41,475
- If he tries to touch me, I'll break his arms.
- Relax.

483
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,480
<i>- Waiter.! Waiter.!</i>

484
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,482
<i>Right here, pal.</i>

485
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,988
<i>These are fantastic.</i>
<i>These are like claws, Bob.</i>

486
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:54,023
<i>- Oh, yeah?</i>
<i>- Claw things.</i>

487
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,025
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>- We'll take all four of these.</i>

488
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,027
- Take 50,000 of'em, if you got 'em.
- I don't know if I can—

489
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,029
- What do you call these?
- Thank you.

490
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,928
- Claws.
- Claws.

491
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,830
Erica, have a claw.
Unbelievable.

492
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,903
Give her some of those, uh...

493
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,097
the shrimp with the, uh—

494
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,970
What do you call the shrimp
with the white paper on the end?

495
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,408
- Paper shrimp.
- Paper shrimp. Give us some of those, okay?

496
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,675
<i>- Okay, anything else?</i>
<i>- That's fine. Paper shrimp. Thank you.</i>

497
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:20,046
Do you work, Erica?

498
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:23,450
Yeah, I, uh—
I work part time at, uh—

499
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,454
The Rowan Gallery in Soho?

500
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,683
- Oh, I've never been there.
- It's a good gallery.

501
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,886
- We could all take a walk there later.
- That would be nice.

502
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:34,226
- Do you paint?
- No. L— I studied painting...

503
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:37,698
- but I'm not an artist.
- Mm-hmm.

504
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,202
I'm in public relations.

505
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:42,465
What are you working on?

506
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:46,566
Well, right now it's a new picture
about an ex-Vietnam vet...

507
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:51,341
who comes back to a small
Midwestern town and shoots 300 people.

508
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,440
- That should make a fortune.
- I think I saw it.

509
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,543
- I don't think so, Hal.
- I saw it, I'm telling you.

510
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,554
You couldn't.
They haven't made it yet.

511
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:01,056
- Sounds familiar.
- Erica.

512
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:04,457
Claire! Hi!

513
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,553
- It's nice to see you.
- Remember Allison?

514
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,859
Hi.

515
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,560
How you doin'?

516
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,899
- Hey, I called you about a hundred times.
- Yeah.

517
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,131
- You're never in.
- I know. I know.

518
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,471
Oh, excuse me. This is, um, Bob.

519
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:23,877
And this is Claire and Fred
and Allison and Elaine and Hal.

520
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,040
- Hal. I'm Hal.
- Fred. Nice to meet you.

521
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,550
- How are you? Glad to know you.
<i>- Can we have lunch next week?</i>

522
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,483
- Yeah. I'll call you.
- Okay.

523
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,852
I will.

524
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,721
<i>- Want a bear claw, honey?</i>
- Oh, she's full.

525
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,886
- I'm sorry, Erica.
Call us if you need anything.
- I will. Thank you.

526
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,726
- Please call me.
- Yeah! I will.

527
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:45,495
Bye-bye.

528
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,505
Hal, this is great.

529
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:54,867
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

530
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,040
What are those things that would come
in this little steamer here?

531
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:05,019
<i> Waiter, can</i>
<i>we have the shrimp with paper?</i>
<i>Bring a couple of Bubble-Up.</i>

532
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,999
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

533
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,568
- You sure?
- This is crazy.

534
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:22,230
<i>- Erica, let's take a walk.</i>
- I feel like I've been
dim-sum-ed out of my mind.

535
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,307
- I think I'm gonna go home.
- You sure?

536
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:25,898
- Oh, come on!
- I'll take you home.

537
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,910
- Stay awhile.
- No, I really wanna go home.

538
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:30,071
- Where do you live?
- You go on, Elaine. I live in the East 60s.

539
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,978
- Good, I'll take you home.
- Bye.

540
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,983
- Well, let me take you home.
- Bye-bye!

541
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:38,020
- I'll see you later. Call you.
- Have a nice time. See you.

542
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,824
- Boy, that's a nervous lady.
- She has a right to be.

543
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,934
I'm divorced.

544
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:00,442
Married 11 years.

545
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:03,377
Two children.

546
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,677
My wife remarried.
She's living out on the island...

547
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:09,378
so I get to see the kids
just about every weekend.

548
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,386
When did you get divorced?

549
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:14,616
It's been... three years.

550
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:17,193
It was tough at first.

551
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:21,253
- You feel very disoriented.
- I know.

552
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:24,425
Yeah, Hal said you were separated?
What happened?

553
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,436
Oh—

554
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:30,996
My husband left me for a younger woman.
Ha, ha, ha.

555
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,542
He must be out of his mind.

556
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:43,515
- Are you uncomfortable?
- With you? No.

557
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,021
Why did you move closer to me?

558
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,023
I don't know. L—

559
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,320
- I guess I want to be closer to you.
- Don't, Bob! Uh-uh!

560
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:54,864
<i>- Why not?</i>
- I said so, that's why. I-I don't want you to.

561
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,160
- I didn't do anything!
- But you want to, don't you?

562
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,633
- You're paranoid.
- Do you or don't you?

563
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,830
What?

564
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:04,908
You'd think I was asking
you to go to bed with me.

565
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,336
I'm just touchy these days.
I'm sorry.

566
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:14,406
You sure are.

567
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,684
Maybe I am being
less than honest. L—

568
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,985
- I'd like to see you again, Erica.
- Oh, I don't think so.

569
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,754
- Why not?
- You seem like a nice man.

570
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:28,093
It-It's not that.
I'm just— I'm not dating.

571
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,666
- Well, what was today?
- Lunch.

572
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:33,566
Well, lunch is dating
in my neighborhood.

573
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,571
Take a girl to lunch, it's dating.

574
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,438
Uh, you're right. Lunch is dating.

575
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:49,579
Oh, God. "Dating."
It's a silly word.

576
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,261
You are a very complicated woman.

577
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,807
I'm crazy about you.

578
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:20,213
<i>You son of a... bitch.!</i>

579
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:22,649
Stop the cab! Stop it!

580
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:25,654
You— Stop the cab!

581
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,747
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't—
- Stop it!

582
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,985
Get out, you son of a bitch!

583
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:31,459
- I didn't do anything!
- Just get out!

584
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,427
Just stop it! Will you stop it?

585
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,693
Just pull the fuck over!

586
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,360
Get out!
I don't want to see you!

587
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,906
I didn't do anything.
This is ridiculous.

588
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:48,842
Just take me home!

589
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,972
Wonderful.

590
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,810
This is a wonderful thing to come home to.

591
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,316
- Get out of here, Phil!
Just get out of my house!
- I'm sorry.

592
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,648
Out! I don't want
to talk about it.

593
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:32,654
- We didn't do anything.
- You just get out!

594
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:34,656
- We didn't do anything!
- Here's your coat. You be quiet, Patti!

595
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:36,453
- No! He's not going to!
- Get out of the door!

596
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,289
- I want him to stay!
- Mrs. Benton— Call you tomorrow!

597
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,295
- Patti!
- Mom, what is with you?

598
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:42,024
Look, you've got—
I don't care what you want!

599
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,430
- You can't run my life!
- Oh, goddamn it!

600
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:47,299
- I hate it here! I don't
want to live here anymore!

601
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:49,895
- I don't want to live here, either!
- You can't stop me from seeing Phil.

602
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:52,066
I can! I can stop you
from doing anything I want!

603
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:54,201
- No, you can't! I'll run away!
- I don't care if you run away.

604
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,506
What did I do that was so wrong?
Just tell me, and I'll understand.

605
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,740
I don't think you would
act like this if your father still lived here.

606
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:01,079
Act like what?
I wasn't having an orgy or anything!

607
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:02,880
- You want me to go to the park?
- Hush!

608
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,920
- Get out of the house!
- Okay, I'll go to the park.

609
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:07,490
- I'll sit on a bench and do it in public.
- Okay, go ahead!

610
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:10,116
I'd like to see you!
You might as well do it in public!

611
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,855
- You don't have any kind
of feeling about anything!
- Fine! I'll do it!

612
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:22,502
- I don't know.
<i>- God, what is with you?</i>

613
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,437
I'm sorry.

614
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:29,945
God. Oh, God.

615
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:36,983
It's just confusing.
L— I'm sorry I screamed at you, Patti.

616
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:39,715
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

617
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:42,087
I just don't understand
why you get so upset.

618
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:45,992
- I just can't be your father.
- So just be my mother!

619
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:53,126
Come here.

620
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:59,875
Come here, honey.

621
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:08,913
Call Phil and tell him I'm sorry.

622
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,147
Uh, tell him he can come over.
We can have an orgy.

623
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,451
Maybe he's got a friend for me.

624
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,789
How was your date?

625
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,557
My date? Oh.

626
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:24,293
We had dim sum. I was almost raped.

627
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,199
- He made a pass?
- Yeah.

628
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:30,467
I don't see what's wrong with that.

629
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,735
You're beginning
to sound like my date.

630
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:39,307
- You okay?
- Yeah. Fine.

631
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:42,384
How 'bout you?

632
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:48,223
Call Phil.

633
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:50,225
Okay.

634
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:06,675
I'm— I'm afraid.
I'm frightened, you know.

635
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,575
- Mm-hmm.
- I've never been afraid of anything...

636
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,580
before in my life.

637
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,310
<i>When I was little, I was</i>—

638
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:16,318
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I was afraid of</i>—

639
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:21,122
that I was gonna get
my clothes dirty, or...

640
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:25,786
you know, I was gonna
get bad marks on my report.

641
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,796
U- U-Uhh.

642
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:31,800
I was afraid when I got my period
for the first time.

643
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:35,360
You know, l—
Well, I got my period...

644
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:39,568
when I was, uh—
when I was 13, you know.

645
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,701
And most of my—Well—

646
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,940
Some of my friends—

647
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:48,017
Well, my best friend—

648
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,615
My best friend
was Karen Fienstein...

649
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:56,159
and she got her period
when she was 12, you know.

650
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:59,956
So I thought there was something wrong
with me, because I didn't get my period.

651
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,793
So I had a terrible year
from 12 to 13.

652
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:04,799
You know, I mean, I-I-I—

653
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:07,267
I thought there was really
something wrong with me.

654
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:09,430
You know, every time
I went to the bathroom...

655
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,007
<i>I would sort of, you know,</i>

656
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,237
<i>- Check and see if l</i>—
<i>Yeah, if I got my period yet.</i>
- And go look.

657
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,371
<i>And, suddenly l</i>—

658
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:20,882
O- Oh, I was wearing—
I was wearing these...

659
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:23,680
dumb little white lace panties...

660
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:26,415
you know, that my grandmother
had given me for my birthday or some—

661
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,423
And, um...

662
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:32,792
suddenly I felt this...

663
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:36,491
wet, warm feeling
in my crotch, you know.

664
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,331
And then l—

665
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:43,099
I felt sort of excited, you know.

666
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:47,076
But then I felt afraid.

667
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:49,611
I was afraid. I was afraid...

668
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:54,047
that I was going to get
blood all over the... chair...

669
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,619
all over my pants.

670
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,520
Then the bell rang,
and then the class got up...

671
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,559
and then I saw Karen, you know.

672
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,790
And I smiled, and I winked
at her, and I went like that.

673
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,833
And she came over, and she said,
"What are you smiling about?"

674
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:14,870
And I said, "I think I got it."
And she said, "Oh, thank God!"

675
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:24,543
I don't really know why
I'm telling you all this.

676
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:28,948
- I mean, it doesn't really—
- Well.

677
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:34,957
Those are very scary moments,
and you think a lot about that
when you're a kid. It's natural.

678
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:38,653
- And what's happening now?
- Everything seems very different.

679
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:41,731
I'm— I'm not able to...

680
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,732
know what's gonna happen.

681
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:46,598
You know, before I had a sense that...

682
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:49,365
- life would go on, and—
<i>- Yes.</i>

683
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:52,601
- Now, it's like every day is like, "Whew!"
<i>- Yeah.</i>

684
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,643
What's gonna happen?
And I don't know how to control it.

685
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:56,644
- And I don't know—
<i>- Yeah.</i>

686
00:51:56,746 --> 00:52:00,409
I don't know—
I don't know what to do.

687
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:05,011
Your whole life has been
disrupted, discombobulated.

688
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,091
And... it's a new life right now.

689
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:13,026
I mean, what can you do? You know,
you can't live my life for me, can you?

690
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:17,362
No. No. I certainly
can't live your life for you.

691
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,367
It's your life.

692
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,994
But what I can do...

693
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:26,337
is to explore it with you
and see what's happening now in your life.

694
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:28,502
Yeah.

695
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:31,877
Maybe the confusion
that you're feeling now...

696
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,882
will clear up.

697
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,884
I'm pretty sure it will.

698
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:41,219
<i>I think, right now, it would be</i>
<i>a really good idea if you came twice a week.</i>

699
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,656
<i>But very quickly</i>
<i>we'll move into once a week.</i>

700
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,254
<i>Because it's a lot more</i>
<i>important what you do out there...</i>

701
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:50,356
<i>than what you do in here.</i>

702
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:38,071
Mr. Benton would like to meet there at 1:00.
Hello, Mrs. Benton.

703
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:40,376
Hi.

704
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,644
It's good to see you.
I'm glad you called.

705
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:45,846
Let me have your coat.

706
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:52,121
- You look terrific.
- I'm worried about Patti.

707
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:56,829
She's very angry at you.

708
00:53:56,933 --> 00:54:02,769
Yeah. Well, she's got a right to be.

709
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:06,239
I'm seeing a therapist, and
I want her to see her too.

710
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,436
- It's expensive.
- That's all right.

711
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:12,276
- I'll-I'll take care of it.
- Good.

712
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:18,612
- Well, that's settled.
- Who's the—Who's the therapist?

713
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:21,953
Oh, her name is Tanya Berkel.

714
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:25,391
- A woman.
- I don't know any men named Tanya.

715
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,631
Well, that's good.
I think that's— that's good.

716
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:32,964
Good. I glad you think it's good.

717
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,398
You really hate me, don't you?

718
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,441
- Yeah.
- I don't hate <i>you.</i>

719
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:43,478
- Oh, you were always a very
compassionate man, Martin.
- Now, wait a minute. L—

720
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,549
How— How can you hate somebody that
you were in love with for 16 years? I don't—

721
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,948
It's easy.

722
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:51,680
If you're trying to make me feel guiltier
than I already do...

723
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,756
- you're doing a good job.
- Good.

724
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:56,690
This is ridiculous.
Why are we having this conversation?

725
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:59,557
Martin, do you know
how many times we made love?

726
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:01,756
- No.
- No, I don't want to get into that.

727
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:04,265
I wanna tell you.
At least 2,000 times.

728
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,699
That's counting
twice a week for 16 years.

729
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,737
You should put it up
on your ticker tape.

730
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:12,171
I think it's a very
interesting statistic.

731
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,334
I wanna know something.

732
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:19,006
Did you fall out of love
with my— my flesh, my body...

733
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:21,549
or me—with Erica?

734
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,551
Did you fall out of love with Erica?

735
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,121
Wait a minute. I didn't
fall out of love with you.

736
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:28,122
L— I love you.

737
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:31,489
<i>I mean, all right,</i>
<i>it-it's different now, but l</i>—

738
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:34,722
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>I can'tjust erase all those years.</i>

739
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,460
<i>- I'll always love you.</i>
- I was your hooker, Martin.

740
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:43,062
<i>I was a bright,</i>
<i>high-priced, classy hooker.</i>

741
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,301
Upper East Side
by way of Vassar hooker...

742
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:48,309
but I was your hooker.

743
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:52,777
You have a lousy shrink.

744
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:55,316
How long do you think
Marcia's gonna last?

745
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:58,612
Well, I'm gonna marry her.

746
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:02,818
The awesome sanctity of marriage.

747
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:06,123
Listen, if you want to sit up here with me
and have a conversation, that's great.

748
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:09,494
But if you want to have an argument,
I think you'd better leave.

749
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,558
- I want to have an argument!
- You're flippin'.

750
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,936
Call Patti.

751
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,210
I never had any self-esteem.
That was the trouble.

752
00:56:41,245 --> 00:56:42,924
I never had any self-esteem.
That was the trouble.

753
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,865
I suppose I thought looks would do it.

754
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:48,699
Well, I'll tell you.
It is a nice feeling to like yourself.

755
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:51,000
Bette Davis
<i>always</i> had self-esteem.

756
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:53,007
- Oh.
- So did Katharine Hepburn.

757
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:55,270
- Mm-hmm.
- Terrific woman.

758
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:58,404
<i>- Look at this.</i>
- Oh.

759
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,540
- Beautiful.
<i>- It's strange, isn't it?</i>

760
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,711
<i>I mean, where are all the wonderful women</i>
<i>that were in the movies in the old days?</i>

761
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:08,450
Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn,
Joan Crawford.

762
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:12,255
- Where are all the women?
- Well, we've got, uh...

763
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:15,889
- Jane Fonda, Barbra Streisand.
- Oh, please. It's not the same thing.

764
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:18,160
I'd hate to see
Fonda and Streisand...

765
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,236
- in a toe-to-toe with Hepburn and Davis.
- Right.

766
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:22,236
- There's no contest.
- Different times.

767
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:24,238
Hi.

768
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,774
- Hi. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?
<i>- No.</i>

769
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:30,073
<i>- Uh-uh.</i>
<i>- We were wondering where all</i>
<i>the women movie stars are...</i>

770
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,080
<i>compared to 20, 30 years ago.</i>

771
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:35,015
Well, um, I think
we're getting to an age...

772
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,985
- where the dominate cult figure is bisexual.
- Oh, God.

773
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:41,147
- Maybe unisexual would be
a more appropriate term.

774
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:43,725
You mean like
Mick and Dylan and David?

775
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:45,727
- That sort of thing?
- Mm-hmm.

776
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:48,525
What's so funny?

777
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:52,965
- Is that good or bad?
- I don't know. Nobody knows.

778
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:55,833
- You're entitled to an opinion.
- Well, I'm not bisexual,
if that's what you mean.

779
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:58,100
- Yes, we know that.
- You know, but maybe she doesn't.

780
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:01,405
How'd we get started on this?

781
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:04,207
Self-esteem.

782
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:08,307
I could write a book on self-esteem.

783
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:11,979
"Self-esteem
and the American Woman."

784
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:14,488
Once divorced...

785
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:19,324
sleeping around,
drinking too much...

786
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:22,455
pretending to have a lot
of self-you-know-what.

787
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:25,534
Really having next to none.

788
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:30,732
<i>- You getting your period, Elaine?</i>
- Sure.

789
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,707
But I also have
no fucking confidence.

790
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:01,827
Here. Drink this.

791
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:08,470
Why do people always
give you water when you fall apart?

792
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:11,604
<i>- I don't need water. I need booze.</i>
<i>- That's a girl.</i>

793
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:16,048
Don't worry, honey.
Aunt Elaine is just a manic-depressive.

794
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:18,450
You know, like, uh,
Jekyll and Hyde?

795
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:22,514
I don't think you get enough vitamin C.

796
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:27,925
- See you guys later.
- Bye, honey.

797
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:30,295
- Bye.
- Take care.

798
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:36,435
- She's somethin' else, Erica.
- Yeah, tough cookie.

799
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:40,441
- She's confused about Martin.
- How is the son of a bitch?

800
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:43,171
Hey. We forgot Claire Trevor.

801
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:47,113
- Jean Arthur, Susan Hayward.
- What about Greta Garbo?

802
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:51,449
That was before my time.

803
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:57,083
I liked Rita Hayworth.
She was pretty.

804
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:12,216
Everywhere I go I see... couples.

805
01:00:12,325 --> 01:00:17,194
I see people holding hands
or their arms around each other...

806
01:00:17,296 --> 01:00:19,730
cheek to cheek or—

807
01:00:19,832 --> 01:00:22,198
I just feel jealous.

808
01:00:26,606 --> 01:00:30,940
Oh, I have so much to say,
you know, at the end of the day.

809
01:00:32,478 --> 01:00:35,709
I tell Patti everything.

810
01:00:37,683 --> 01:00:41,517
I think about her, you know,
going away to school and—

811
01:00:43,256 --> 01:00:46,225
I know it's, uh—
it's a couple of years away...

812
01:00:46,325 --> 01:00:50,557
but I think about it as if...

813
01:00:50,663 --> 01:00:53,427
it's gonna happen,
you know, tomorrow.

814
01:00:53,533 --> 01:00:56,934
- Yes.
- L—

815
01:00:57,036 --> 01:01:00,767
I guess I'm lonely.

816
01:01:02,675 --> 01:01:06,907
I was very lonely too
when I got divorced.

817
01:01:07,013 --> 01:01:09,311
I didn't know you were divorced.

818
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,315
Yes.

819
01:01:14,453 --> 01:01:17,047
And it's certainly okay to feel lonely.

820
01:01:17,156 --> 01:01:21,217
You're supposed to in a situation like this.

821
01:01:23,896 --> 01:01:27,559
It's— It's what is—
what's expected.

822
01:01:29,535 --> 01:01:32,470
It's really okay to feel anything—

823
01:01:32,572 --> 01:01:36,838
anger, jealousy...

824
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,138
depression.

825
01:01:42,348 --> 01:01:44,248
It's okay to feel.

826
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:48,548
I— I feel guilty about my feelings.

827
01:01:50,923 --> 01:01:56,486
Well, guilt is something
that I get livid about...

828
01:01:56,596 --> 01:01:59,326
because it's kind of
a man-made emotion.

829
01:01:59,432 --> 01:02:02,924
And, uh...

830
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:08,035
I would like to see you...

831
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,836
take a vacation from guilt.

832
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:13,377
Stop feeling guilty for one week.

833
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:17,506
Just-Just say, "Erica, turn off the guilt."

834
01:02:17,617 --> 01:02:21,678
Just turn it off.
Don't feel guilty.

835
01:02:21,787 --> 01:02:27,282
It doesn't get you anywheres.
It really prolongs the agony.

836
01:02:28,794 --> 01:02:30,989
And—

837
01:02:33,766 --> 01:02:36,792
- I know what you mean. I'll try.
- Yeah.

838
01:02:36,902 --> 01:02:40,360
And don't feel guilty
about feeling guilty, either.

839
01:02:40,473 --> 01:02:43,101
And don't feel ashamed
of your feelings.

840
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:45,439
They're your feelings.
They have no I.Q.

841
01:02:45,544 --> 01:02:49,173
They have no morality.
They're your feelings. Just feel 'em.

842
01:02:49,281 --> 01:02:52,273
When were you divorced?

843
01:02:52,385 --> 01:02:55,821
I was divorced three years ago.

844
01:02:57,957 --> 01:03:02,485
But let's get back to you
and loneliness.

845
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,798
When you were married,
did you ever feel lonely?

846
01:03:06,899 --> 01:03:10,665
- No, not really. No.
- When you were married, did you feel lonely?

847
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:12,704
Never?

848
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,570
No.

849
01:03:17,677 --> 01:03:22,444
Well, sometimes, but
I wasn't scared then, you know?

850
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:26,314
This scares me.

851
01:03:28,354 --> 01:03:31,016
It is scary.
It's a whole new way of life.

852
01:03:31,123 --> 01:03:35,150
Did you ever find yourself
<i>wanting</i> to be alone?

853
01:03:35,261 --> 01:03:38,196
Yes! But I knew it
wasn't gonna be forever.

854
01:03:38,297 --> 01:03:43,030
Does it feel to you as if this is gonna
be forever— the way you feel now?

855
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,641
Well...

856
01:03:52,978 --> 01:03:56,914
I haven't had sex
for seven weeks.

857
01:03:58,451 --> 01:04:01,249
It's been seven weeks since Martin left.

858
01:04:01,353 --> 01:04:04,220
I always took sex for granted.

859
01:04:04,323 --> 01:04:06,587
Are you feeling sexy these days?

860
01:04:06,692 --> 01:04:09,525
Hardly.

861
01:04:12,998 --> 01:04:16,434
And, uh—

862
01:04:24,243 --> 01:04:27,110
- What was I saying?
- Sex.

863
01:04:27,213 --> 01:04:29,306
Oh, yes.

864
01:04:29,415 --> 01:04:31,246
I was hoping you'd forgotten.

865
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:33,784
Um...

866
01:04:33,886 --> 01:04:38,789
well, we just had
a pretty good sex life, you know.

867
01:04:38,891 --> 01:04:42,224
I just— It was very—

868
01:04:42,328 --> 01:04:45,058
This isn't fun.

869
01:04:45,164 --> 01:04:47,064
No.

870
01:04:47,166 --> 01:04:50,067
I just—

871
01:04:50,169 --> 01:04:53,502
- I enjoyed sex. It was— It was nice.
- Mm-hmm.

872
01:04:53,606 --> 01:04:57,406
We were pretty... wild,
Martin and me.

873
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:00,070
Mm-hmm. Tell me
what you mean by that.

874
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:02,340
Wha-What do you mean,
you were pretty wild?

875
01:05:02,448 --> 01:05:07,147
Well, we had a good sex life.

876
01:05:07,253 --> 01:05:09,721
What exactly was it like?

877
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:12,814
Jesus! What do you think
happened? What happens?

878
01:05:12,925 --> 01:05:18,795
You sound pretty angry.
What's that all about?

879
01:05:18,898 --> 01:05:21,526
If I knew that, I wouldn't be here.

880
01:05:36,882 --> 01:05:39,908
Well, what are you
gonna do about it?

881
01:05:47,593 --> 01:05:51,188
You're looking at me
as if I have the answers.

882
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:55,426
I don't have the answer for you.

883
01:06:02,308 --> 01:06:05,402
I can tell you what I would do...

884
01:06:05,511 --> 01:06:08,912
if I were me
and I were in your situation.

885
01:06:12,618 --> 01:06:14,552
What?

886
01:06:14,653 --> 01:06:17,781
Well, one thing, I'd do a lot
of what you're doing already.

887
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:21,257
I'd be a— I'd spend
a lot of time with my friends...

888
01:06:22,695 --> 01:06:24,720
as you're doing.

889
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:29,733
And I'd also sort of
take myself by the hand...

890
01:06:29,835 --> 01:06:35,569
and say, "Come on, Tanya.
Get into the stream of life.

891
01:06:35,674 --> 01:06:37,835
"Get back in there.

892
01:06:37,943 --> 01:06:40,673
"Don't be scared
of going out with guys.

893
01:06:40,779 --> 01:06:44,340
Let's open the door and walk out
and get in the stream of life."

894
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:47,317
- Men, huh?
- Yeah, men.

895
01:06:47,419 --> 01:06:50,650
I'd risk it. I'd risk it
with some new men.

896
01:06:52,324 --> 01:06:57,159
They're people, you know.
I think you could enjoy them.

897
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:02,699
Take a chance.

898
01:07:02,801 --> 01:07:06,328
Yeah. I guess I should.

899
01:07:06,438 --> 01:07:09,532
Ugh.

900
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:41,106
- Can I help you?
- I'll have a glass of white wine, please.

901
01:07:48,547 --> 01:07:51,744
Two beers, Tom.

902
01:08:07,566 --> 01:08:11,002
- Erica!
- Hi!

903
01:08:13,072 --> 01:08:15,199
- Come, join us.
- Okay.

904
01:08:18,811 --> 01:08:23,510
It's good to see you.
Erica Benton, Edward Thoreaux.

905
01:08:23,615 --> 01:08:25,810
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

906
01:08:25,918 --> 01:08:27,818
Erica works over at the Rowan.

907
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,150
Oh, really?
I haven't seen the new show.

908
01:08:30,255 --> 01:08:33,713
Oh, it's very controversial.
Either you love it or you hate it.

909
01:08:33,826 --> 01:08:37,523
Edward just got back
from a year in Rome. He's a painter.

910
01:08:37,629 --> 01:08:39,529
How was Rome?

911
01:08:39,631 --> 01:08:43,761
Oh, it's very controversial.
Either you love it or you hate it. I loved it.

912
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:46,201
How are you, Erica?

913
01:08:46,305 --> 01:08:49,240
Oh, I'm a little weird these days.

914
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:52,606
- I'm getting divorced.
- Ah, I'm surprised.

915
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:55,703
- Why?
- You seem like such a normal person.

916
01:08:55,814 --> 01:08:57,805
Compared to me, that is.

917
01:08:57,916 --> 01:09:01,784
It's the normal people who are getting
divorced. Nobody else bothers to get married.

918
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:06,290
If I got married every time I thought
it was serious, I would be in lots of trouble.

919
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:08,519
How are you?

920
01:09:08,627 --> 01:09:10,788
The work I'm doing is nice.

921
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:13,660
Edward and I are definitely an item.

922
01:09:13,766 --> 01:09:17,133
- So life is good.
- One hates to be thought of as an item.

923
01:09:20,272 --> 01:09:22,399
Hey, what's happening, babe?

924
01:09:22,508 --> 01:09:24,772
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey, Charlie.

925
01:09:24,877 --> 01:09:28,973
- Jean, how ya doin'?
- Hi. My name is Edward Thoreaux.

926
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:31,709
- Charlie. Nice to see you.
- How do you do?

927
01:09:31,817 --> 01:09:34,945
- Were you slumming?
- I wasn't up till now.

928
01:09:35,054 --> 01:09:37,215
What does she want from me?

929
01:09:37,322 --> 01:09:40,985
There's a party at Tom Whalen's loft.
Do you want to come?

930
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:44,062
Tom Whalen? You mean the guy
who paints the turtles?

931
01:09:44,163 --> 01:09:47,291
- Yeah.
- I pass. Thanks.

932
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:51,392
- Erica?
- I don't think so.

933
01:09:51,503 --> 01:09:53,835
It was nice to meet you.

934
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:56,237
<i>Arrivederla.</i>

935
01:10:02,581 --> 01:10:05,448
<i>Arrivederla,</i> my ass.

936
01:10:06,585 --> 01:10:09,679
Listen, what are you doing
out by yourself? Where's honey?

937
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:14,191
- We're getting divorced.
- No shit? What happened?

938
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:17,751
He was buying a shirt in Bloomingdale's,
and he fell in love.

939
01:10:20,499 --> 01:10:24,458
- Am I supposed to be sorry or what?
- No.

940
01:10:27,239 --> 01:10:30,902
- Buy me another glass of wine, Charlie.
- Be right back.

941
01:10:55,667 --> 01:10:57,931
Take me to your loft, Charlie.

942
01:11:13,485 --> 01:11:16,318
Well, you want a cup of coffee?
Something to eat?

943
01:11:16,421 --> 01:11:18,981
- Uh-uh.
- A bottle of Chianti in the kitchen.

944
01:11:19,091 --> 01:11:20,991
Charlie, let's just do it, okay?

945
01:11:21,093 --> 01:11:22,993
Now, before I change my mind.

946
01:11:23,095 --> 01:11:25,063
Okay, okay.

947
01:11:25,164 --> 01:11:29,726
Let's just get something
straight right off the top, babe, huh?

948
01:11:29,835 --> 01:11:32,429
I don't get involved with my women.

949
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:34,506
I'm a short-term guy.

950
01:11:34,606 --> 01:11:36,938
I don't fall in love.
I don't wanna get married.

951
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:40,068
- Right.
- The only thing you can
count on me for is sex.

952
01:11:40,179 --> 01:11:42,443
I am what I am.
I make no bones about it.

953
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:46,609
Charlie, I'm very nervous.
Your talking is just making me more nervous.

954
01:11:46,718 --> 01:11:49,448
Okay.

955
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:52,217
- You havin' trouble?
- Yeah.

956
01:11:52,324 --> 01:11:54,918
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

957
01:11:55,027 --> 01:11:57,894
Here. Here. Wait.
Hold it! Hold it!

958
01:11:57,996 --> 01:12:00,430
Just a second!
You got your thing caught.

959
01:12:00,532 --> 01:12:03,126
- My necklace is in it.
- All right, all right, all right, all right.

960
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:05,567
Careful. There we go.

961
01:12:05,671 --> 01:12:07,866
Oh, what a disaster!

962
01:12:07,973 --> 01:12:10,737
Cheer up, will ya?

963
01:12:10,842 --> 01:12:13,208
Yeah. Ahh.

964
01:12:13,312 --> 01:12:16,611
The maiden! Delightful.

965
01:12:16,715 --> 01:12:18,910
Delightful.

966
01:12:27,826 --> 01:12:31,489
Will you stop actin'
like some kind of virgin, huh?

967
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:36,000
<i>Yoo-hoo? Miss? Yo.!</i>

968
01:12:40,038 --> 01:12:43,804
Ah, here you are.

969
01:12:43,909 --> 01:12:46,173
Hi.

970
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:50,772
Charlie, I've only
slept with one man in 17 years.

971
01:12:50,882 --> 01:12:53,749
Jesus, I was wrong.

972
01:12:53,852 --> 01:12:56,946
I could've sworn
you've had a few affairs.

973
01:13:03,762 --> 01:13:06,788
Oh, man, what a beautiful body.

974
01:13:11,837 --> 01:13:14,431
Come here.

975
01:13:14,539 --> 01:13:17,736
Cheer up, will ya?
This is your party.

976
01:13:24,049 --> 01:13:27,610
I'm a little embarrassed.

977
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:29,619
- When does she stop?
- Ow!

978
01:13:29,721 --> 01:13:31,848
What happened? An injury.

979
01:13:31,957 --> 01:13:34,653
- What's the matter?
<i>- A splinter.</i>

980
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:37,593
- Where?
- In my toe.

981
01:13:37,696 --> 01:13:40,927
A splinter in the toe?
The foot doctor's here.

982
01:13:41,033 --> 01:13:44,730
Let me see.
Let me see.

983
01:13:44,836 --> 01:13:47,964
First we'll have to remove
the outer garments.

984
01:13:49,741 --> 01:13:51,333
Oh, yes.

985
01:13:53,111 --> 01:13:56,979
Ah, what a lovely
piece of equipment.

986
01:13:57,082 --> 01:13:58,982
Hmm? Hmm?

987
01:14:06,391 --> 01:14:08,951
Huh.

988
01:14:14,132 --> 01:14:17,829
You like that, huh?
You like that, don't you?

989
01:14:29,414 --> 01:14:32,975
Your turn, baby. Hmm?
You gonna turn me on?

990
01:15:29,141 --> 01:15:32,736
- That was nice. Very nice.
- I have to go.

991
01:15:32,844 --> 01:15:35,039
I'll see you tomorrow night, okay?

992
01:15:35,147 --> 01:15:38,116
- No.
- What's the matter? You mad at me?

993
01:15:38,216 --> 01:15:40,377
- No.
- Come back tomorrow night.

994
01:15:40,485 --> 01:15:43,420
- Uh-uh.
- Why not?

995
01:15:43,522 --> 01:15:48,016
I don't fall in love, Charlie.
I'm a— I'm a short-term guy.

996
01:15:48,126 --> 01:15:51,755
I'll tell you one thing.

997
01:15:51,863 --> 01:15:54,525
Your ex-old man's a fuckin' asshole.

998
01:15:56,234 --> 01:15:58,225
Good night, Charlie.

999
01:17:22,654 --> 01:17:24,554
Hi.

1000
01:17:30,328 --> 01:17:32,888
Wait a minute.
I want to talk to you.

1001
01:17:32,998 --> 01:17:35,296
- Call me.
- Hey, come on.

1002
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,301
Hey, you wanna give me
a heart attack or what?

1003
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:40,769
Jesus, Martin!
What do you want?

1004
01:17:40,872 --> 01:17:43,773
Well, I just wanted to tell you
that I had a nice talk with Patti.

1005
01:17:43,875 --> 01:17:46,070
- She's okay.
- I know.

1006
01:17:46,177 --> 01:17:48,611
How are you?

1007
01:17:49,981 --> 01:17:51,881
I got laid last night.

1008
01:17:53,952 --> 01:17:55,852
- Remember Billy Higgins?
- Uh-uh.

1009
01:17:55,954 --> 01:17:59,219
Yeah, you do. He's that big, tall,
blond guy, worked for Merrill Lynch.

1010
01:17:59,324 --> 01:18:02,122
- Tennis player. About my age.
- Right, right. Yeah.

1011
01:18:02,227 --> 01:18:04,491
He had a heart attack last week.
He dropped dead.

1012
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:07,759
- That's too bad.
- You look good.

1013
01:18:07,866 --> 01:18:11,563
Would you try to have
a linear conversation, Martin?

1014
01:18:11,670 --> 01:18:14,332
Look, wait a minute.
I just want us to be friends.

1015
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:16,430
I mean, if not for my sake,
then for Patti's.

1016
01:18:16,541 --> 01:18:18,441
I don't wanna be your friend!

1017
01:18:18,543 --> 01:18:20,602
- What the hell do you want me to do?
- Just leave me alone.

1018
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:25,875
Well, Billy was supposed
to go out to L.A.

1019
01:18:25,984 --> 01:18:29,283
- Now they want me to take his spot.
- Take it.

1020
01:18:29,387 --> 01:18:32,322
- Well, it means I'd have to move out there.
- Good.

1021
01:18:32,424 --> 01:18:36,690
If I do go out, can Patti come out
and spend some time with me?

1022
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:38,786
You'll have to ask Patti.

1023
01:19:07,459 --> 01:19:09,518
Herbert, what do you think?

1024
01:19:09,628 --> 01:19:11,562
It looks a little
high on the right to me.

1025
01:19:13,765 --> 01:19:18,395
High on the right.
Hmm. What do you think?

1026
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:21,438
I- I think the whole thing
is too high.

1027
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:23,473
I like it where it is.

1028
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:29,677
<i> If you liked it where it is,</i>
<i>then why did you ask me?</i>

1029
01:19:29,781 --> 01:19:32,511
<i>Why don't we talk about it over lunch?</i>

1030
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:47,927
Where would you like
to go for dinner?

1031
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:52,595
I can't, Saul. My daughter's coming home
from school. We're eating at home.

1032
01:19:52,704 --> 01:19:55,298
- Well, give her a call.
Tell her to join us.
- No!

1033
01:19:55,407 --> 01:19:59,173
- Well, she doesn't have
to know I'm your lover.
- You're not my lover.

1034
01:19:59,277 --> 01:20:02,644
Well, uh—
You, you know what I mean.

1035
01:20:02,747 --> 01:20:07,241
I'm not very good
at hiding my feelings, Saul.

1036
01:20:07,352 --> 01:20:09,877
What are your feelings?

1037
01:20:11,289 --> 01:20:16,659
Well, l— I just slept with
a man that I barely know.

1038
01:20:16,761 --> 01:20:19,992
- I mean, casual sex is not my—
- No, no.

1039
01:20:20,098 --> 01:20:23,829
- I-I don't—
- No, it's not— I don't sleep
with every woman I meet.

1040
01:20:23,935 --> 01:20:29,840
I'm experimenting. I'm—
Well, I know it sounds a little cold...

1041
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:33,468
but that's... the way it is these days.

1042
01:20:33,578 --> 01:20:37,912
I just want to see how it feels to make love
to someone that I'm not in love with.

1043
01:20:38,016 --> 01:20:40,416
How does it feel?

1044
01:20:40,518 --> 01:20:42,418
Sort of empty.

1045
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:44,420
Well, at least you're honest.

1046
01:20:44,522 --> 01:20:47,389
The sex was very good.
You're a very nice man.

1047
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:53,090
You have a bizarre way
of handing out a compliment.

1048
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:55,325
It was the best I could do.

1049
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,940
<i>Why did you flirt</i>
<i>with me at the gallery?</i>

1050
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:06,510
I think it was mutual.

1051
01:21:06,611 --> 01:21:09,944
<i>Ah, silly games we play.</i>

1052
01:21:10,048 --> 01:21:13,040
There's no need for them, you know.

1053
01:21:13,151 --> 01:21:16,917
- Do you want to know how I really feel?
- Yes, I do.

1054
01:21:17,021 --> 01:21:19,751
As soon as the sex was over,
I wanted to leave.

1055
01:21:19,858 --> 01:21:24,852
- That's very hostile.
- I don't feel hostile. I like you.

1056
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:28,421
Perhaps you'd better go home.
I'm getting a very big headache.

1057
01:21:28,533 --> 01:21:32,264
My husband used to get headaches
whenever I didn't want to have sex.

1058
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:35,567
Poor bugger must have had migraines.

1059
01:21:35,673 --> 01:21:38,642
- You-You got a coat?
- Yeah.

1060
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:03,390
I'll see you later.

1061
01:22:14,879 --> 01:22:17,177
- Behave yourselves, ladies.
- Oh, yeah?

1062
01:22:17,282 --> 01:22:20,581
- We'll try.
- I'm always good.

1063
01:22:20,685 --> 01:22:23,415
Just show me the bar.

1064
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:26,081
- Ah.
- That did it.

1065
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:29,592
I've gotta go home pretty soon.

1066
01:22:34,732 --> 01:22:37,633
<i>- Hello, Erica.</i>
- Hi, Edward.

1067
01:22:37,735 --> 01:22:39,930
Nice to see you.

1068
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:43,007
- These are my friends.
This is Elaine Liebowitz.
- How do you do?

1069
01:22:43,107 --> 01:22:46,508
- Edward Thoreaux. And Sue Miller.
- How do you do?

1070
01:22:46,611 --> 01:22:48,511
- And Jeannette Lewin.
- Nice to meet you.

1071
01:22:48,613 --> 01:22:50,513
- Hi, Erica.
- Can I take your coats?

1072
01:22:50,615 --> 01:22:52,776
- You look wonderful!
- Thanks.

1073
01:22:52,884 --> 01:22:56,047
I'm Jean Starret.
Erica has told me about your, uh, club.

1074
01:22:56,154 --> 01:23:00,318
This is Jeannette and Elaine and Sue.

1075
01:23:00,425 --> 01:23:04,191
- What club?
- Do you know anything
about consciousness raising?

1076
01:23:04,295 --> 01:23:06,354
- Not really.
- Neither do we.

1077
01:23:06,464 --> 01:23:09,024
<i>Wejust kind of get together</i>
<i>once a week and complain a lot.</i>

1078
01:23:09,133 --> 01:23:11,533
- That's very American.
- Aren't you an American?

1079
01:23:11,636 --> 01:23:13,831
I'm from Cleveland,
but I try to forget it.

1080
01:23:13,938 --> 01:23:16,930
- I was hoping you'd show up.
- How's your headache?

1081
01:23:18,409 --> 01:23:20,673
I had it ever since you left.

1082
01:23:22,947 --> 01:23:25,347
How's the party?

1083
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:27,441
Usual.

1084
01:23:29,187 --> 01:23:33,146
Well, whenever you put
about 50 artists together in one room...

1085
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:36,591
you get a really
pleasant combination...

1086
01:23:36,694 --> 01:23:40,630
of gossip, paranoia,
envy, fear, trembling...

1087
01:23:40,732 --> 01:23:45,726
hatred, lust and pretense.

1088
01:23:45,837 --> 01:23:47,998
It's, uh, wonderful.

1089
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:50,597
Tell me some good gossip.

1090
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:55,174
Good gossip, eh? Hmm.

1091
01:23:56,948 --> 01:24:01,009
Oh. You see the short,
wiry fellow in the corner?

1092
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:03,587
The one with his arm
around Lady MacBeth?

1093
01:24:03,688 --> 01:24:07,454
<i>Well, his name is Conrad Zweiback.</i>
<i>He's Hungarian. Very intense. Very ambitious.</i>

1094
01:24:07,558 --> 01:24:10,857
- Can't paint for shit.
- Who's the woman?

1095
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:14,398
She's the wife
of Henry Gebhart, the critic.

1096
01:24:16,334 --> 01:24:18,529
<i>- Oh, I've never met him.</i>
<i>- Oh, he's a spider.</i>

1097
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:22,197
Sets traps for young artists,
using his wife as bait.

1098
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:26,266
- Is he gay?
- Oh, no. No, not at all.
That would make sense.

1099
01:24:26,377 --> 01:24:30,711
No, it appears he likes to watch
his wife make love to other men.

1100
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:33,943
Now, if the other man
is pleasing to Lady MacBeth...

1101
01:24:34,052 --> 01:24:36,816
he becomes the new
discovery of Gebhart.

1102
01:24:36,921 --> 01:24:40,550
- How do you know all this?
- I was discovered by Henry Gebhart.

1103
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:43,786
I'm kidding.

1104
01:24:43,895 --> 01:24:46,125
No, but it's true.
The story's true.

1105
01:24:46,230 --> 01:24:49,097
- You're very beautiful tonight.
- You look very good yourself.

1106
01:24:52,103 --> 01:24:54,003
Shall we dance?

1107
01:24:54,105 --> 01:24:56,198
You're full of surprises.

1108
01:24:56,307 --> 01:24:58,605
Remember, we don't
really know each other.

1109
01:24:58,710 --> 01:25:00,837
- Tanya!
- Erica!

1110
01:25:00,945 --> 01:25:03,607
- How great to see you here.
- What are you doing here?

1111
01:25:03,715 --> 01:25:06,377
- I'm an old friend ofJean Starret's.
- Ohh.

1112
01:25:06,484 --> 01:25:09,044
And I'd like to have you meet
my friend, Sophie Windham.

1113
01:25:09,153 --> 01:25:11,246
- Hello.
- Erica Benton.

1114
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:13,688
Uh, this is Saul Kaplan.
Tanya Berkel.

1115
01:25:13,791 --> 01:25:15,691
- Hi, Saul.
- Hello. Hi. Hi.

1116
01:25:15,793 --> 01:25:18,956
- Nice to meet you.
- And we're looking around
forJean, so we'll go along.

1117
01:25:19,063 --> 01:25:23,090
- I think she's back there.
- Okay, but I see something to eat
in there, so we'll go in there.

1118
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:25,499
- Okay.
- See you later. Have fun.

1119
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:33,008
- Who was that woman?
- Oh, that was no woman.
That was my therapist.

1120
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:41,545
- Having a good time?
- Yeah. You?

1121
01:25:41,652 --> 01:25:44,018
- Hey, what do you say, babe?
- Charlie! God.

1122
01:25:44,122 --> 01:25:46,181
- Do you know each other?
- Yeah.

1123
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:49,418
Charlie tells me
he's a great artist.

1124
01:25:49,527 --> 01:25:53,395
Uh, this is Elaine,
and this is Jeannette.

1125
01:25:53,498 --> 01:25:55,398
- Hello.
- This is Charlie.

1126
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,468
- Hello.
- This is Saul Kaplan.

1127
01:25:57,568 --> 01:26:00,537
Saul Kaplan? <i>The</i> Saul Kaplan?

1128
01:26:00,638 --> 01:26:03,163
Oh, let me get over there.

1129
01:26:03,274 --> 01:26:06,573
Hey, this is a real honor.
I mean, really!

1130
01:26:06,677 --> 01:26:09,009
Hey, I bow at your feet, man.

1131
01:26:09,113 --> 01:26:13,049
Now, this guy's a real fucking artist.

1132
01:26:14,519 --> 01:26:15,918
Thank you. You may rise.

1133
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:17,885
- Thank <i>you.</i>
- You're drunk, Charlie.

1134
01:26:17,989 --> 01:26:20,014
Yes, and stoned.

1135
01:26:20,124 --> 01:26:23,321
Great combo.

1136
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:26,864
- Is he dangerous?
- Oh, ask her if I'm good, babe.

1137
01:26:26,964 --> 01:26:29,990
- Shut up, Charlie. Jesus!
- Ohhh, we really got it on one night.

1138
01:26:30,101 --> 01:26:32,035
I mean, dynamite.

1139
01:26:32,136 --> 01:26:36,038
And she slams the door in my face.
What did I do to deserve such a rotten fate?

1140
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:39,041
I balled my ass off;
the lady won't see me again.

1141
01:26:41,712 --> 01:26:44,272
- It's getting to be a '60's party.
- What, is it raining?

1142
01:26:44,382 --> 01:26:46,680
What happened? What happened?

1143
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:49,184
- Why don't you go home, Charlie.
- Why don't you fuck off!

1144
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:51,187
- I'll wipe the floor with you.
- Up yours!

1145
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:55,385
- Come on. Let's leave.
- No, no. No. He leaves. We stay.

1146
01:26:55,493 --> 01:26:59,327
Oh, I get it.
You're ballin' her too.

1147
01:26:59,430 --> 01:27:03,059
If you don't mind
your dumb fuckin' manners—

1148
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:31,785
I thought you were gonna kill him.

1149
01:27:31,896 --> 01:27:35,024
No, I wouldn't give the bastard
the satisfaction.

1150
01:27:35,133 --> 01:27:39,570
If he made the front page
of the <i>Daily News,</i> he'd end up famous.

1151
01:27:41,739 --> 01:27:45,436
His work is good, actually.
I was surprised.

1152
01:27:45,543 --> 01:27:48,569
Well, you can be a bastard
and have talent.

1153
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:53,173
Where'd you see his work, eh?

1154
01:27:53,284 --> 01:27:56,845
His place. You disappointed in me?

1155
01:27:59,023 --> 01:28:02,220
I don't know you well enough
to be disappointed in you.

1156
01:28:03,995 --> 01:28:07,487
But if you ever do it again,
I'll kill you.

1157
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:18,700
You're a strange man.

1158
01:28:18,809 --> 01:28:22,609
No, I'm a simple man really.
Got very simple tastes.

1159
01:28:22,713 --> 01:28:26,114
I like Titian, Rembrandt,
Botticelli, <i>Kojak...</i>

1160
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:28,515
Camembert cheese...

1161
01:28:28,619 --> 01:28:30,519
expensive shoes—

1162
01:28:30,621 --> 01:28:32,521
I have bad feet—

1163
01:28:32,623 --> 01:28:35,922
London, Vermont,
New York about half the time.

1164
01:28:36,027 --> 01:28:38,359
And being madly in love.

1165
01:28:38,462 --> 01:28:41,124
And I've been without that
for a long time now.

1166
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:44,690
What's so funny, eh?
What the hell are you laughing at, eh?

1167
01:28:44,802 --> 01:28:47,999
I bare my soul, and you laugh at me.
What is it?

1168
01:28:48,105 --> 01:28:51,074
You stepped in dog shit!

1169
01:28:51,175 --> 01:28:56,203
I think this is poodle shit.

1170
01:28:56,314 --> 01:28:59,875
Oh, yes, after a while, you can tell
one kind from another.

1171
01:28:59,984 --> 01:29:03,283
I can even tell the difference
between an East Side dog...

1172
01:29:03,387 --> 01:29:05,821
an uptown dog and a Village dog.

1173
01:29:05,923 --> 01:29:07,914
Now, East Side dogs
shit only the best...

1174
01:29:08,025 --> 01:29:09,993
and Village dogs shit art.

1175
01:29:11,429 --> 01:29:13,329
In London, they don't
shit at all, you know.

1176
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:15,331
I don't think they're
allowed to, no, no.

1177
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:19,802
In London, I think they have an underground
passage where all the dogs shit.

1178
01:29:22,139 --> 01:29:25,006
I was born in London, you know.

1179
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:28,374
My mother and my father
had a shop near Stepney Green.

1180
01:29:28,479 --> 01:29:31,039
That's the Lower East Side
of London.

1181
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:36,714
One day when I was about six,
my parents had a row, you know.

1182
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:44,861
My mother, she threw a pickled herring
at my dad, and it, uh, missed.

1183
01:29:47,898 --> 01:29:50,366
Splattered all against the wall.

1184
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:53,869
I took one look
at that pickled herring...

1185
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:59,534
and that's when I decided
to become an abstract expressionist.

1186
01:30:23,367 --> 01:30:26,803
Your work does remind me
of pickled herring.

1187
01:30:28,539 --> 01:30:30,439
Mmm.

1188
01:30:34,845 --> 01:30:39,714
Hey, I want to know
about that man you lived with.

1189
01:30:39,817 --> 01:30:41,751
Were you passionate
with each other?

1190
01:30:41,852 --> 01:30:44,844
- You mean sexually?
- I mean in every way.

1191
01:30:44,955 --> 01:30:48,948
Well, we were married
for a very long time.

1192
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:51,551
- Well, I was married for nine years.
- Really?

1193
01:30:51,662 --> 01:30:54,222
Eight of those years
were very passionate.

1194
01:30:54,332 --> 01:30:57,199
Well, "passion's" a mild word for it, really.

1195
01:30:57,301 --> 01:30:59,667
It's—Well, it was more like war.

1196
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:01,601
How did your marriage end?

1197
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:03,697
Not with a whimper, but with a bang.

1198
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:06,834
Matilda— Her name is Matilda—

1199
01:31:06,944 --> 01:31:10,812
She wrote poetry for her soul, and she swam
a hundred laps a day for her body.

1200
01:31:10,915 --> 01:31:13,383
Now, this was after we had
the two children.

1201
01:31:13,484 --> 01:31:16,248
- Boys?
- My son is 12. My daughter's nine.

1202
01:31:16,354 --> 01:31:19,755
Well, one day I came home,
and I found her in bed...

1203
01:31:19,857 --> 01:31:22,621
with a high diver
from the local pool.

1204
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:25,560
- Oh, God.
- I wanted to kill the poor sap,
but something kept me from it.

1205
01:31:25,663 --> 01:31:28,689
- What?
- He was about seven feet tall.

1206
01:31:30,568 --> 01:31:33,867
Oh, you know something? L—

1207
01:31:37,908 --> 01:31:40,536
I wasn't angry.

1208
01:31:40,644 --> 01:31:43,135
I felt relief, really.

1209
01:31:44,382 --> 01:31:47,146
I was glad it was over—
for both of us!

1210
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:50,584
Well, I wasn't a very good husband.

1211
01:31:50,688 --> 01:31:54,522
My work means everything to me.

1212
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:57,355
I don't think I believe that.

1213
01:32:06,303 --> 01:32:08,203
Don't you miss your children?

1214
01:32:08,305 --> 01:32:11,968
I love them. Sometimes I miss them.

1215
01:32:14,044 --> 01:32:17,673
But I see them every summer. We have
a place up in Vermont. You'll like it.

1216
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:20,342
You seem to have my life
worked out for me.

1217
01:32:20,451 --> 01:32:22,942
For us. I want you.

1218
01:32:23,053 --> 01:32:25,715
- You know that?
- Yes, I'm getting the message.

1219
01:32:25,823 --> 01:32:27,256
Do you want me?

1220
01:32:27,358 --> 01:32:29,986
My head tells me to slow down.

1221
01:32:33,998 --> 01:32:36,159
But I don't think my pulse is normal.

1222
01:32:46,177 --> 01:32:49,408
You know, there are three things
that we could do right now.

1223
01:32:58,989 --> 01:33:01,719
You could call a taxi and go home.

1224
01:33:06,564 --> 01:33:10,261
Or we could go on walking,
and, uh, I could lecture you...

1225
01:33:10,367 --> 01:33:13,825
on the real dilemma of modern art.

1226
01:33:13,938 --> 01:33:17,897
Or we could go to my place,
and we could thoroughly enjoy each other.

1227
01:36:52,289 --> 01:36:55,281
You want hot sauce on your eggs?

1228
01:36:56,694 --> 01:36:58,594
Please.

1229
01:36:58,696 --> 01:37:01,790
<i>- Grated cheese?</i>
- Everything.

1230
01:37:15,379 --> 01:37:17,472
I feel great.

1231
01:37:17,581 --> 01:37:19,708
I feel... happy.

1232
01:37:19,817 --> 01:37:23,344
I- I don't know what's going on.
This is craziness.

1233
01:37:24,855 --> 01:37:28,086
I don't understand anything anymore.

1234
01:37:29,727 --> 01:37:33,686
I feel— I like
to do things, you know.

1235
01:37:33,797 --> 01:37:37,563
- I want to travel.
- We'll travel.

1236
01:37:37,668 --> 01:37:40,865
I want to see Greece.
I want to see Persia.

1237
01:37:40,971 --> 01:37:43,166
<i>I'd like to go to Tibet.</i>

1238
01:37:43,273 --> 01:37:45,434
I'd like to open up
a little restaurant.

1239
01:37:45,542 --> 01:37:49,444
Nothing fancy. Just a little something
where I sing under a spotlight.

1240
01:37:49,546 --> 01:37:53,073
You ever thought about skateboarding?

1241
01:37:55,753 --> 01:37:58,745
I do want to go to India!

1242
01:38:00,624 --> 01:38:02,558
India I can do without.

1243
01:38:02,659 --> 01:38:04,718
Why?

1244
01:38:04,828 --> 01:38:06,921
I like a nice bathroom.

1245
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:16,264
I may go back to school.

1246
01:38:17,775 --> 01:38:19,675
I may go back to school.

1247
01:38:20,811 --> 01:38:23,041
What's wrong with the gallery?

1248
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:26,412
Oh, I need more money. I don't
want to depend on Martin forever.

1249
01:38:27,785 --> 01:38:31,221
Also, I could use
a real challenge in my work.

1250
01:38:33,257 --> 01:38:36,317
Live with me.
That'd be a real challenge.

1251
01:38:36,426 --> 01:38:39,293
I could use a challenge in my <i>work.</i>

1252
01:38:40,631 --> 01:38:42,758
Living with me is work.

1253
01:38:42,866 --> 01:38:45,528
Hey, this is really delicious.

1254
01:38:47,671 --> 01:38:49,935
I'm serious.

1255
01:38:51,408 --> 01:38:53,899
So am I.

1256
01:38:59,383 --> 01:39:01,317
Does it still feel empty?

1257
01:39:01,418 --> 01:39:04,683
No, but it tastes like hot sauce.

1258
01:39:14,765 --> 01:39:16,858
Why do you only have one child?

1259
01:39:16,967 --> 01:39:18,867
Do you want to have a child?

1260
01:39:18,969 --> 01:39:21,403
No, no, no.

1261
01:39:21,505 --> 01:39:25,566
Well, I had two miscarriages
after Patti.

1262
01:39:25,676 --> 01:39:28,304
I quit trying. Why?

1263
01:39:33,617 --> 01:39:38,850
Because... I want to know
everything there is to know about you.

1264
01:39:43,093 --> 01:39:46,324
Mm. Paint! Paint!

1265
01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:48,864
Paint! Please, paint!

1266
01:39:48,966 --> 01:39:53,266
- You are the most delicious
woman I've ever met!

1267
01:39:53,370 --> 01:39:57,568
- I have to go.
- There's something so damn
Victorian about you!

1268
01:39:57,674 --> 01:40:00,575
Will you ever, ever
spend the whole day...

1269
01:40:00,677 --> 01:40:03,612
followed by the whole night
with me in this room?

1270
01:40:03,714 --> 01:40:06,080
I don't know!

1271
01:40:08,418 --> 01:40:11,353
Look, I'll come over to your place
if it's any easier.

1272
01:40:11,455 --> 01:40:14,356
There's just something
so nice about sleeping...

1273
01:40:14,458 --> 01:40:17,222
and waking up
with a person that you like.

1274
01:40:17,327 --> 01:40:18,777
You really know how
to rush a girl, don't you?

1275
01:40:18,812 --> 01:40:20,227
You really know how
to rush a girl, don't you?

1276
01:40:22,332 --> 01:40:27,964
Erica, underneath
this haunted, driven shell of a man...

1277
01:40:28,071 --> 01:40:30,835
there lives a warm homebody...

1278
01:40:30,941 --> 01:40:33,239
who likes to watch TV
and chew cashews...

1279
01:40:33,343 --> 01:40:36,039
while the woman he loves
is finishing a good novel.

1280
01:40:36,146 --> 01:40:38,546
Sounds like my marriage.

1281
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:49,092
I want to meet your daughter.

1282
01:40:49,192 --> 01:40:51,717
- Now?
- Whenever.

1283
01:40:55,532 --> 01:40:57,830
Come to dinner tomorrow night.

1284
01:41:01,505 --> 01:41:03,598
Don't know the address.

1285
01:41:28,832 --> 01:41:30,732
I like your style.

1286
01:41:59,930 --> 01:42:02,990
A girl in my school
got an abortion last week.

1287
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:06,331
- How old is she?
- Sixteen.

1288
01:42:06,436 --> 01:42:08,870
- It's not that unusual.
- Do I know her?

1289
01:42:08,972 --> 01:42:13,272
Mm-mm. Cost 200 bucks.
She said it was awful too.

1290
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:16,369
The doctor kissed her on the mouth
right after the abortion.

1291
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:18,414
- Oh, God!
- Two hundred bucks!

1292
01:42:18,515 --> 01:42:20,710
What about her parents?
Do they know?

1293
01:42:20,817 --> 01:42:23,513
- No way!
- Well, who paid for it?

1294
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:26,088
We all chipped in.

1295
01:42:26,189 --> 01:42:29,750
- What about the boy?
- She was too embarrassed to ask him.

1296
01:42:31,194 --> 01:42:34,220
That stinks.

1297
01:42:34,331 --> 01:42:37,698
- Here comes Casanova.
- Oh, I'm warning you.

1298
01:42:37,801 --> 01:42:40,634
- I'm warning you.
- Shake it.

1299
01:42:45,742 --> 01:42:47,642
- Hello.
- Hi.

1300
01:42:58,789 --> 01:43:03,021
- All right?
- Thank you. Uh-huh. Come in.

1301
01:43:05,862 --> 01:43:09,320
This is Patti Benton. Saul Kaplan.

1302
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:11,333
- Hello.
- Hi.

1303
01:43:11,435 --> 01:43:14,632
I saw one of your paintings
in the Museum of Modern Art.

1304
01:43:14,738 --> 01:43:16,933
Oh? Did you like it?

1305
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:19,031
I didn't understand it.

1306
01:43:19,142 --> 01:43:22,441
- Hmm. Well, I'm gonna like you.
- She never lies.

1307
01:43:22,546 --> 01:43:24,411
How old are you?

1308
01:43:26,216 --> 01:43:28,116
- Forty-two.
- You don't look it.

1309
01:43:28,218 --> 01:43:31,016
- You look older.
- Patti!

1310
01:43:33,090 --> 01:43:36,389
- How old do I look?
- I already know. You're 15.

1311
01:43:36,493 --> 01:43:40,589
- Do I look it?
- You look much older.

1312
01:43:40,697 --> 01:43:42,597
Good.

1313
01:43:44,067 --> 01:43:46,900
- Can I have some?
- With dinner.

1314
01:43:47,003 --> 01:43:49,301
Give her half a glass.
Cut it with water.

1315
01:43:49,406 --> 01:43:52,534
- Yeah, that's what the French do.
- We're not French.

1316
01:43:52,642 --> 01:43:58,046
Booze is worse than grass.
I smoke grass once in a while.

1317
01:43:58,148 --> 01:43:59,979
- So do I.
- Got any?

1318
01:44:00,083 --> 01:44:02,813
Now, don't be precocious, Patti.

1319
01:44:02,919 --> 01:44:06,878
I'm not being precocious.
I'm just a normal 15-year-old girl.

1320
01:44:08,258 --> 01:44:10,818
<i>Actually, I'm not normal.</i>
<i>I'm still a virgin.</i>

1321
01:44:10,927 --> 01:44:13,054
Patti, come into
the kitchen with me.

1322
01:44:15,565 --> 01:44:17,465
Excuse us.

1323
01:44:21,438 --> 01:44:23,668
- You're being very rude!
- I guess I'm just nervous.

1324
01:44:23,773 --> 01:44:26,606
- This is the first time
you've brought a man home.
- Do you like him?

1325
01:44:26,710 --> 01:44:30,237
It's too early to tell. He's cute.

1326
01:44:30,347 --> 01:44:33,510
This is—This is really delicious.

1327
01:44:35,619 --> 01:44:37,712
Your mother's a very good cook.

1328
01:44:37,821 --> 01:44:40,289
How can you tell from one dish?

1329
01:44:42,092 --> 01:44:44,617
She made eggs for me the other night.

1330
01:44:44,728 --> 01:44:47,060
With hot sauce and grated cheese?

1331
01:44:47,164 --> 01:44:49,064
- That's right.
- Hmph.

1332
01:44:49,166 --> 01:44:51,896
She really likes you then.

1333
01:44:52,002 --> 01:44:54,800
I don't think I'm having
fun at this party.

1334
01:44:54,905 --> 01:44:56,805
I am.

1335
01:44:56,907 --> 01:44:59,102
Relax.

1336
01:44:59,209 --> 01:45:02,144
I know that you and Saul are lovers.

1337
01:45:03,847 --> 01:45:06,179
It's not funny.

1338
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:11,749
What's the matter? You always
told me to tell the truth.

1339
01:45:11,855 --> 01:45:15,518
It's obvious that you invited
Saul here to prepare me.

1340
01:45:15,625 --> 01:45:18,355
Prepare you for what?

1341
01:45:18,461 --> 01:45:21,453
Um, look, I'm the one
who asked to come here.

1342
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:24,193
- I wanted to meet you.
- I have a father.

1343
01:45:29,306 --> 01:45:31,934
I don't want to be your father.

1344
01:45:32,042 --> 01:45:34,306
I'm not marrying Saul. L—

1345
01:45:34,411 --> 01:45:36,311
- Marry him! I don't care!
- He's my friend.

1346
01:45:36,413 --> 01:45:39,075
So marry him.
It doesn't matter to me.

1347
01:45:43,653 --> 01:45:46,952
Nobody's asking you
to stop loving your father.

1348
01:45:47,057 --> 01:45:51,118
Well, you know, it would be easier
if Daddy could see me here sometimes.

1349
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:58,659
Okay.

1350
01:46:07,210 --> 01:46:09,110
Sorry.

1351
01:46:09,212 --> 01:46:12,079
I behaved like a 15-year-old.

1352
01:46:15,118 --> 01:46:18,388
I do it all the time.

1353
01:46:20,323 --> 01:46:22,883
# Maybe I'm a man
Maybe I'm a lonely man #

1354
01:46:22,993 --> 01:46:25,359
#Who's in the middle of something #

1355
01:46:25,462 --> 01:46:28,260
#That he doesn't really understand #

1356
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:32,200
# Maybe I'm a man #

1357
01:46:32,302 --> 01:46:35,533
# Maybe you're the only woman
who can ever help me #

1358
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:38,369
# Baby, won't you
help me understand #

1359
01:46:41,044 --> 01:46:46,209
# Maybe I'm amazed at the way
you're with me all the time #

1360
01:46:46,316 --> 01:46:49,513
# Maybe I'm afraid
of the way I need you #

1361
01:46:51,321 --> 01:46:55,815
# Maybe I'm amazed at the way
you help me sing my song #

1362
01:46:55,925 --> 01:46:58,450
#You right me when I'm wrong #

1363
01:46:58,561 --> 01:47:01,894
# Maybe I'm amazed at the way
I really need you #

1364
01:47:04,134 --> 01:47:07,126
# Maybe I'm a man
Maybe I'm a lonely man #

1365
01:47:07,237 --> 01:47:09,637
#Who's in the middle of something #

1366
01:47:09,739 --> 01:47:12,867
#That he doesn't really understand #

1367
01:47:14,811 --> 01:47:16,711
# Maybe I'm a man #

1368
01:47:16,813 --> 01:47:20,078
# Maybe you're the only woman
who can ever help me #

1369
01:47:20,183 --> 01:47:22,879
# Baby, won't you help me under—##

1370
01:47:40,570 --> 01:47:42,834
Good morning.

1371
01:47:42,939 --> 01:47:45,032
Hi. How come
you're not jogging?

1372
01:47:45,141 --> 01:47:47,268
Oh, I had an early
appointment with this guy.

1373
01:47:47,377 --> 01:47:49,311
What's, uh—What's up?

1374
01:47:49,412 --> 01:47:52,040
Well, I've decided that
you can come to the apartment...

1375
01:47:52,148 --> 01:47:54,048
to see Patti whenever you want.

1376
01:47:54,150 --> 01:47:56,744
- Oh, good. I'm glad.
- Just call first.

1377
01:47:56,853 --> 01:48:00,084
Okay. Oh, I meant to tell you.
I'm not going to California now.

1378
01:48:00,190 --> 01:48:03,523
- Why?
- Oh, a lot of things. Mostly, no money.

1379
01:48:03,626 --> 01:48:07,118
Well, you know, I've, uh—
I've stopped seeing my therapist, and...

1380
01:48:07,230 --> 01:48:09,926
well, I'm looking around
for a better job, so...

1381
01:48:10,033 --> 01:48:12,661
the money thing will be
a lot easier for you.

1382
01:48:12,769 --> 01:48:14,896
We could make it real easy
if you want to.

1383
01:48:15,004 --> 01:48:17,165
What do you mean?

1384
01:48:17,273 --> 01:48:20,606
Well, I broke up with Marcia.

1385
01:48:20,710 --> 01:48:22,735
I'm surprised.

1386
01:48:22,846 --> 01:48:25,076
Yeah, I am too, kind of.

1387
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:29,583
Well, the truth of it is she left me.

1388
01:48:29,686 --> 01:48:33,588
I don't know. I mean, the minute
I moved in there, we stopped having fun.

1389
01:48:35,792 --> 01:48:38,454
It's craziness.

1390
01:48:38,561 --> 01:48:41,121
I'm sorry.

1391
01:48:41,231 --> 01:48:43,131
Are you really?

1392
01:48:43,233 --> 01:48:46,134
Yeah, I'm sorry for you.

1393
01:48:46,236 --> 01:48:49,137
- I want to come back.
- No.

1394
01:48:49,239 --> 01:48:53,733
- Will you think about it?
- No, Martin.

1395
01:48:55,945 --> 01:49:00,405
I mean, I was thinkin'
you could think of me...

1396
01:49:00,517 --> 01:49:04,681
as this guy who was sick for a long time,
you know, and then recovered.

1397
01:49:04,788 --> 01:49:07,222
Think you could do that?

1398
01:49:10,026 --> 01:49:12,221
It doesn't work that way, you know?

1399
01:49:16,266 --> 01:49:20,066
Yeah. Patti said you have a boyfriend.

1400
01:49:20,170 --> 01:49:23,139
Yeah. We're goin' steady.

1401
01:49:27,911 --> 01:49:30,471
Well, I'll call you.

1402
01:49:30,580 --> 01:49:32,241
Bye.

1403
01:49:32,348 --> 01:49:34,942
Bye, Martin.

1404
01:49:52,669 --> 01:49:55,934
Patti's gonna have to spend
more time alone.

1405
01:49:56,039 --> 01:49:58,098
Oh, she can cope with that.

1406
01:49:58,208 --> 01:50:02,110
Yeah. I worry about her.

1407
01:50:02,212 --> 01:50:05,010
I have to. I have to.

1408
01:50:05,114 --> 01:50:08,379
- You don't have to.
- I do.

1409
01:50:08,485 --> 01:50:11,215
I have enough money for both of us.

1410
01:50:11,321 --> 01:50:13,789
I don't want your money, Saul.

1411
01:50:13,890 --> 01:50:18,293
Look, I'd take your money,
if I needed it... and if you had it.

1412
01:50:18,394 --> 01:50:21,522
But, you—you're an artist.

1413
01:50:21,631 --> 01:50:24,930
Oh, yes.

1414
01:50:26,769 --> 01:50:28,794
What's Patti doing this summer?

1415
01:50:28,905 --> 01:50:31,237
Oh, she wants to go
to summer school.

1416
01:50:31,341 --> 01:50:34,242
Well, you know what would be nice—
what would be very nice indeed—

1417
01:50:34,344 --> 01:50:37,541
would be if both of you
came up to Vermont...

1418
01:50:37,647 --> 01:50:39,706
for the whole of the summer.

1419
01:50:39,816 --> 01:50:42,842
I can't leave the gallery.

1420
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:45,920
I can't.

1421
01:50:46,022 --> 01:50:47,922
He'd let you go for the summer.

1422
01:50:48,024 --> 01:50:51,187
Well, maybe for a week,
but not for the whole summer.

1423
01:50:51,294 --> 01:50:55,321
- It's very beautiful.
- Oh.

1424
01:50:56,866 --> 01:50:58,766
Want one?

1425
01:50:58,868 --> 01:51:02,565
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, um, one lemon, please.

1426
01:51:02,672 --> 01:51:04,572
- Make it two.
- I'm sorry. No lemon. Vanilla.

1427
01:51:04,674 --> 01:51:06,574
- Okay. That's all right.
- Fine. Good.

1428
01:51:06,676 --> 01:51:09,509
- Your children will be there, won't they?
- Yes, they certainly will!

1429
01:51:09,612 --> 01:51:12,046
Yes. Well, we'd have a lot of fun.

1430
01:51:12,148 --> 01:51:14,082
- Madame.
- Fine.

1431
01:51:14,183 --> 01:51:16,083
I can't.

1432
01:51:16,185 --> 01:51:18,346
You keep saying you can't.

1433
01:51:18,454 --> 01:51:20,354
How much are these, please?

1434
01:51:20,456 --> 01:51:22,356
- Twenty cents each, please.
- Twenty cents each.

1435
01:51:22,458 --> 01:51:25,586
- "I can't."
- Thank you very much, sir.

1436
01:51:25,695 --> 01:51:27,993
- Well, I can't.
- Oh, you can.

1437
01:51:28,097 --> 01:51:31,191
What am I gonna do up there?

1438
01:51:31,301 --> 01:51:35,829
Watch you paint?
Go fishing? Go swimming?

1439
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:38,499
Well, it sounds nice, doesn't it?

1440
01:51:38,608 --> 01:51:41,509
Ah, yeah.

1441
01:51:41,611 --> 01:51:44,774
I'll come up
for a couple of weekends.

1442
01:51:46,416 --> 01:51:48,884
Life is very complicated.

1443
01:51:48,985 --> 01:51:54,082
I've been on vacation for 16 years.

1444
01:51:56,125 --> 01:51:59,891
Oh, look, listen. I-I know you want
to get out on your own.

1445
01:51:59,996 --> 01:52:02,726
And I approve.
I wouldn't try to stop you.

1446
01:52:02,832 --> 01:52:04,732
- What do you mean, you approve?
- What?

1447
01:52:04,834 --> 01:52:07,394
- I don't understand that word.
Why are you saying you approve?
- Oh, look.

1448
01:52:07,503 --> 01:52:10,063
- I'm not doing this
for your approval, you know.
- No, listen. Let me finish.

1449
01:52:10,173 --> 01:52:12,903
- No, that's really not what I have on my mind.
- Please. All I meant was—

1450
01:52:13,009 --> 01:52:16,570
- I hate that.
- Yes. All I meant was that if—

1451
01:52:16,679 --> 01:52:19,512
Well, spending a few weeks with someone
you like— that's not out of line.

1452
01:52:19,616 --> 01:52:21,846
How do you know?
How can you say that?

1453
01:52:21,951 --> 01:52:25,318
How do you know what I need,
what I want to do for myself?

1454
01:52:26,856 --> 01:52:29,154
I think we need
a marriage counselor.

1455
01:52:32,195 --> 01:52:34,322
Why don't you come back here
every weekend?

1456
01:52:34,430 --> 01:52:36,921
Because if I stop painting
for a few days...

1457
01:52:37,033 --> 01:52:38,933
I may stop painting altogether.

1458
01:52:48,945 --> 01:52:51,106
Do you really believe that?

1459
01:52:51,214 --> 01:52:53,114
Absolutely.

1460
01:52:58,755 --> 01:53:00,586
Men!

1461
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:03,921
Women.

1462
01:53:30,286 --> 01:53:32,720
You know what I did yesterday?

1463
01:53:32,822 --> 01:53:35,620
I threw out a whole new
jar of blackberry jam.

1464
01:53:35,725 --> 01:53:38,159
Martin loved blackberry jam.

1465
01:53:39,962 --> 01:53:45,400
I think the problem was that I didn't
do things as myself, you know.

1466
01:53:45,501 --> 01:53:48,595
I did things as this—

1467
01:53:48,705 --> 01:53:52,038
Martin and Erica,
Martin and Erica.

1468
01:53:52,141 --> 01:53:55,269
It wasn't his fault.
L— I liked it.

1469
01:53:56,879 --> 01:53:59,848
Saul and Erica will be different
from Martin and Erica.

1470
01:54:02,251 --> 01:54:05,550
- You want to see other women?
- I want you!

1471
01:54:05,655 --> 01:54:07,953
- You're free to.
- I don't want to.

1472
01:54:08,057 --> 01:54:10,582
Then don't.

1473
01:54:10,693 --> 01:54:12,718
Do you want to see other men?

1474
01:54:12,829 --> 01:54:14,729
Not today.

1475
01:54:14,831 --> 01:54:17,265
I'm getting a headache.

1476
01:54:21,504 --> 01:54:24,166
I have to go back to work.

1477
01:54:24,273 --> 01:54:26,173
So do I.

1478
01:54:42,024 --> 01:54:44,322
Would you rather go back to bed?

1479
01:54:44,427 --> 01:54:46,554
Mm-hmm.

1480
01:54:46,662 --> 01:54:48,630
Yes?

1481
01:55:14,924 --> 01:55:18,291
This thing needs oil.

1482
01:55:28,004 --> 01:55:31,701
See, I'm gonna put those pillows,
you know, from the sofa around there.

1483
01:55:31,808 --> 01:55:33,799
- Mm-hmm.
- Carpet.

1484
01:55:36,345 --> 01:55:40,042
- Has a lot of outlets.
- Yeah, a lot of outlets.

1485
01:55:42,418 --> 01:55:44,318
Ta-da!

1486
01:55:44,420 --> 01:55:46,820
Another fireplace!

1487
01:55:46,923 --> 01:55:49,619
It's nice, isn't it?

1488
01:55:49,725 --> 01:55:51,989
- I can afford it.
- Then take it.

1489
01:55:52,094 --> 01:55:54,995
I don't know what to do
with Saul, you know.

1490
01:55:55,097 --> 01:55:58,692
He wants me to go to Vermont.
He goes there for five months!

1491
01:55:58,801 --> 01:56:01,599
- Then don't take it.
- You're a lot of help.

1492
01:56:01,704 --> 01:56:04,537
Why don't I go to Vermont?

1493
01:56:04,640 --> 01:56:08,303
You stay here,
work your ass off and be sensible.

1494
01:56:08,411 --> 01:56:11,778
I'll go pick berries
and dance in the woods with Saul.

1495
01:56:11,881 --> 01:56:14,145
It's confusing, Elaine.

1496
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:18,914
Since I started taking Lithium,
I feel more sensible
than this month's <i>Good Housekeeping.</i>

1497
01:56:19,021 --> 01:56:23,151
No more black, moody lows.
But I sure as hell miss my highs.

1498
01:56:41,143 --> 01:56:43,111
- You want my advice?
- Yeah.

1499
01:56:43,212 --> 01:56:45,806
Do you know how rare
a man like Saul is?

1500
01:56:45,915 --> 01:56:48,349
You know how many jerks
there are out there?

1501
01:56:48,451 --> 01:56:52,182
He's smart. He's funny.

1502
01:56:52,288 --> 01:56:55,849
- Is he a good lover?
- Eh.

1503
01:56:58,494 --> 01:57:01,361
Start packin', honey.

1504
01:57:04,467 --> 01:57:08,699
I finally settled down.
I gotta tell you this.

1505
01:57:08,804 --> 01:57:11,204
Oh, it's crazy.

1506
01:57:11,307 --> 01:57:14,276
It's okay, honey.
It's really okay.

1507
01:57:26,856 --> 01:57:29,984
<i>You're looking very beautiful.</i>

1508
01:57:30,092 --> 01:57:32,754
But you're traveling awfully light.

1509
01:57:52,982 --> 01:57:55,143
How do you pack pickled herring?

1510
01:57:55,251 --> 01:57:57,947
I'll definitely come up for holidays.

1511
01:58:02,558 --> 01:58:07,325
Do you know what it's like
up there in the woods all alone?

1512
01:58:07,430 --> 01:58:11,696
- Paint.
- Hmm.

1513
01:58:11,801 --> 01:58:14,964
Perhaps I'll find some nice,
warm moose to keep me company.

1514
01:58:15,071 --> 01:58:18,097
Am I only a sexual object to you?

1515
01:58:20,142 --> 01:58:22,303
No.

1516
01:58:22,411 --> 01:58:26,939
No, you're a bright,
willful, curious woman...

1517
01:58:28,818 --> 01:58:31,378
who is also a sexual object.

1518
01:58:35,624 --> 01:58:38,559
I hope it's the hottest...

1519
01:58:38,661 --> 01:58:41,994
muggiest, most miserable
summer on record.

1520
01:58:42,098 --> 01:58:45,261
You're so damn stubborn!

1521
01:58:45,368 --> 01:58:48,098
I'm not. I'm really not.

1522
01:58:48,204 --> 01:58:51,105
Come with me, for Christ's sake!

1523
01:58:55,244 --> 01:58:57,269
I can't.

1524
01:59:00,249 --> 01:59:03,912
- Independent.
- Trying to be.

1525
01:59:06,122 --> 01:59:08,090
Woman.

1526
01:59:11,193 --> 01:59:15,527
- Vicious.
- No. Honest.

1527
01:59:17,466 --> 01:59:19,832
You're driving me crazy.

1528
02:00:03,946 --> 02:00:06,540
Okay, Mario, I've got it!

1529
02:00:16,959 --> 02:00:19,154
- Will you hold this a minute?
- Yeah.

1530
02:00:29,338 --> 02:00:31,067
- Have you got it?
- I got it.

1531
02:00:41,450 --> 02:00:44,078
- Bye.
- What about this?

1532
02:00:44,186 --> 02:00:47,986
- Oh, that's for you.
- How the hell am I gonna get it home?

1533
02:00:49,625 --> 02:00:51,786
Take a taxi.
