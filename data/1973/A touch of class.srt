1
00:02:18,955 --> 00:02:21,321
Thataway, yes, sir! That's one.

2
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:23,425
Let's go, boy. Let's go, baby.

3
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:25,120
Come on. Check to him.

4
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:35,266
- Safe.
- Flex it. Come on.

5
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,895
Pitch it in.

6
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,899
Run!

7
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,175
Fair ball.

8
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,510
Fair ball?

9
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:52,579
That ball was foul, you blind son of a bitch!

10
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,282
It was that side of the tree.

11
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:56,552
By 5 yards that ball was foul.

12
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:58,751
What the hell do we have a tree for?

13
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:02,696
Why do we have a damn tree
if the ball falls 5 yards that side of it...

14
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,630
...and you still call it fair?

15
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:07,234
Give me my ball, lady.

16
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:08,927
Give me my kid, mister.

17
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,597
If you've finished trampling on him.

18
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:15,344
Right.

19
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:16,343
Thank you.

20
00:03:17,146 --> 00:03:19,171
Come on. There you go, pal.

21
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:24,148
- You all right?
- Now can I have my ball?

22
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,347
- What?
- You're holding my ball.

23
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:27,882
Your ball?

24
00:03:29,225 --> 00:03:30,920
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

25
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,967
What about your ball? Come on.

26
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:25,572
Taxi!

27
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:26,539
Taxi!

28
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,515
- Share it?
- Why not?

29
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:46,585
Where to?

30
00:05:46,996 --> 00:05:49,294
- Where to?
- 80 Grosvenor Street, please.

31
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,368
Lady's going to 80 Grosvenor Street.
I'll be going on.

32
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,204
- That is exactly 60 pence with the tip.
- Forget it.

33
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,706
It's the right amount.
I take this trip every day.

34
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,572
- Not necessary.
- How kind.

35
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:02,902
I'll buy a house in the country.

36
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,077
- Terrible weather.
- Filthy.

37
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:08,810
If you live in London, you have to expect it.

38
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:11,313
Do you live in London?

39
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:12,752
- I do.
- Me, too.

40
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:14,312
- Really?
- Five years.

41
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,947
Practically English.

42
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,860
- Last habitable city in the world, isn't it?
- Yes.

43
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:22,623
You do anything you like.
Nobody bothers you.

44
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:27,259
- My name is Steven Blackburn.
- Vickie Allessio.

45
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:30,797
- It sounds Italian.
- It's my husband's name.

46
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:33,505
Were those your kids in the park?

47
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:35,009
- Yes.
- Nice-looking boys.

48
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:39,014
- Thank you, but one of the boys is a girl.
- I see.

49
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:42,577
I suppose your husband
likes to sleep late on Sundays.

50
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,846
Yes, he does.

51
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:46,983
You like to go home
and cook him a nice big breakfast.

52
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:47,784
No.

53
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:50,222
- Don't you like to cook?
- I love it.

54
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:52,591
- Doesn't he like to eat?
- He loves to eat.

55
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:55,162
- I don't understand.
- We have different kitchens.

56
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,596
His is in Milan.

57
00:06:57,733 --> 00:06:58,825
That's a shame.

58
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:01,131
Please don't cry. He found another cook.

59
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,203
- Thank you very much.
- Mrs. Allessio?

60
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,110
You have a very good memory.

61
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,945
- What about tea?
- When?

62
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:16,715
- Tomorrow?
- Fine.

63
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:18,048
The Churchill.

64
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:19,679
Great. See you then.

65
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:21,915
- What time?
- 4:00.

66
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:23,989
It won't break up your day?

67
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:29,891
Don't cross-examine me in the rain.
I'll be there wet, but I'll be there.

68
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:49,714
- Just a second, Derek.
- Good afternoon.

69
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:51,685
- Lunch tomorrow?
- We haven't had tea yet.

70
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:54,450
If I can change one appointment,
I can be clear, okay?

71
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:58,654
Do you only eat and drink? I know nothing
but your name and that you play baseball.

72
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,458
From the way you played,
it's obviously not your career.

73
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:03,226
I'm in insurance. I'm married.

74
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:05,324
I live close to where Disraeli lived.

75
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,336
I have two kids and I'm a Leo.
Now, what about lunch tomorrow?

76
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,167
We should see how tea goes.

77
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:11,672
See how tea goes?

78
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:15,144
I'll talk to you later, Derek.

79
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:18,707
- Who's Derek?
- My male secretary.

80
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:34,087
Tea for two, please.

81
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:37,989
- What do you do?
- I'm in the rag trade.

82
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:40,365
- Buy or sell?
- I steal.

83
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:43,061
- Steal?
- I do, truly.

84
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,267
I steal designs from people like Dior,
Cardin, and Givenchy.

85
00:08:46,342 --> 00:08:49,209
I send them to my boss,
Mr. Sam Fingleman of New York...

86
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,146
...who makes them up in cheap materials
and brings the rue St. HonorÃ© to Kline's.

87
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,241
- Sounds like very creative work.
- Thank you.

88
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:57,218
- Where'd you learn? Paris?
- No, Italy.

89
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,481
- I took a course in Milan.
- Enter Mr. Allessio.

90
00:08:59,555 --> 00:09:00,886
- Yes.
- Also in the rag trade.

91
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:05,186
No. He specialized in charm.
It comes easy to Italians.

92
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:08,321
We were married for several years
and had two children...

93
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:10,797
...and three cars, and he kept the cars.

94
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:13,868
- What about child support?
- He's rather odd about that.

95
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:18,032
He won't send me anything for the kids,
if I don't send him something for the cars.

96
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:19,404
What about your wife?

97
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,404
Good-looking, bright, articulate,
can start a fire with two pieces of wood.

98
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:28,075
We've been married for 11 years
and I've never been unfaithful to her...

99
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:29,481
...in the same city.

100
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:31,520
- Where is she now?
- Out of town.

101
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:33,452
- I see.
- What about lunch?

102
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:35,513
- What do you have in mind?
- Just lunch.

103
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:37,923
- Where?
- I know a cute continental restaurant.

104
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,019
- Italian?
- Continental.

105
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:43,190
It's very discreet, out of the way,
it's sort of...

106
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:44,555
...a hotel.

107
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,467
It's a very nice hotel.
It's got good food, great wine...

108
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,039
- I mean...
- What the hell, a girl has to eat.

109
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:16,055
It's difficult to steal in France,
because they expect you to.

110
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:18,430
- They are such snobs with their clothes...
- Waiter.

111
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:21,265
- I'm boring you to tears.
- Not at all.

112
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:24,669
Why are you asking for the check?
I would have liked coffee.

113
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,140
Of course, it's just that...

114
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:30,172
...l've got this friend who's got this...

115
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:32,714
- Little place upstairs.
- Little place upstairs.

116
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:35,945
I thought we'd have some coffee and...

117
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,747
- Cognac?
- Cognac.

118
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,186
- You've been there before.
- I'm wildly guessing.

119
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:44,188
- Shall we?
- Why not?

120
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,420
Why pay for something
when you can get it for free?

121
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:53,132
I didn't mean it to sound like that.
Would you please forget what I said?

122
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:54,963
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

123
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:57,067
- You're welcome.
- Where do I go?

124
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:58,629
- Thank you.
- 'Bye, madam.

125
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,470
Thank you, sir.

126
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:04,174
How long have you been divorced?

127
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,611
About six months.

128
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:08,439
You had two kids in the first three years?

129
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:10,917
No, I had them in the first two years.

130
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:12,578
Was he Catholic?

131
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,247
No, he wasn't Catholic
and I wasn't careless.

132
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:18,553
I just wanted those kids. I don't know.

133
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:21,960
It all suddenly became extremely fine.

134
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:25,592
- Then why'd you keep his name?
- It was the only thing he was giving away.

135
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:27,727
My God, you ask a lot of questions.

136
00:11:27,803 --> 00:11:30,772
People either hate it or love it.
It's about 70/30.

137
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:34,369
- Milk and sugar?
- Sugar, please.

138
00:11:35,978 --> 00:11:39,175
You know, it's a funny thing.
I can always tell about people.

139
00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:41,910
- Can you?
- I know immediately when I'm relating.

140
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:44,077
I felt it right away with you.

141
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,115
Do you feel it, too?

142
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:48,789
Well, I...

143
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,426
I must feel something,
otherwise why am I here...

144
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:54,361
...when I should be stealing
Saint Laurent's new autumn line?

145
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,263
- Exactly.
- Can I say something to you?

146
00:11:57,333 --> 00:11:58,231
Sure.

147
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:02,034
In the past two days,
you have picked me up in the rain...

148
00:12:02,104 --> 00:12:05,164
...given me tea, bought me lunch,
lured me to this hideaway...

149
00:12:05,241 --> 00:12:07,675
...with the intention
of getting me into bed...

150
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:10,473
...for what you Americans
so charmingly call "a quickie."

151
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:12,104
Is that a fair resumÃ© so far?

152
00:12:12,181 --> 00:12:14,115
Why do women always think the worst?

153
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:17,584
Why does sex always have to be
the first thing that... Yes.

154
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:21,385
I'll be honest with you.
I'm a divorced woman.

155
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:24,654
I'm under a lot of strain and tension.
I'm not sleeping too well.

156
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:27,423
I can do with some good,
healthy, uninvolved sex...

157
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:31,432
...with someone who loves his wife and
won't be a pain in the ass when it's over.

158
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,400
This must be your lucky day.

159
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:37,131
I thought it was, but not in this
overworked little joy station...

160
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:41,836
...where the sheets haven't been changed
and I've to be in the office in half an hour.

161
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:45,540
If you would like to arrange
a nice weekend somewhere...

162
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:49,310
...away from London, in the sun,
where the sheets are changed every day...

163
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:51,910
...please do. I would be very happy
to go with you.

164
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:55,884
Say something. Is it a deal?

165
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,017
It would do us both a world of good.

166
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,755
You rather more than me.

167
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:05,630
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. I have another one.

168
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,652
Anything special, Derek?

169
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,491
No, not really.

170
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:37,591
Just the weekly sarcastic note
from New York.

171
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:41,659
Donnelly still wonders why Paris
runs ahead of us on sales and adjustments.

172
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,131
Also, Braithwaite took his usual
upside-down look at this lot...

173
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:48,199
...and started measuring your chair size.

174
00:13:48,377 --> 00:13:49,639
Anything else?

175
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,004
Isn't that enough?

176
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,049
Could you get me one
of those continental weather reports?

177
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:56,542
Continental weather report.

178
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:44,024
Excuse me.

179
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:56,900
What?

180
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,240
Come in.

181
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:01,246
Good afternoon.

182
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,746
- I have a surprise.
- What?

183
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,946
I've arranged us a week in Spain.

184
00:15:06,422 --> 00:15:09,391
Could you just move,
because I'm trying to sketch.

185
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,154
- Pretty as you are, I can't see through you.
- I'm sorry.

186
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:13,319
- A week?
- A week.

187
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:16,330
- I said a weekend.
- You can't just spend a weekend in Spain.

188
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:19,390
- It takes that long for room service.
- What about my children?

189
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:21,663
Who will run this place?
Maggie, the shoulder.

190
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:26,299
You'll love it. Warm winds, great food,
buffet right by the swimming pool.

191
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:28,069
Big soft towels.

192
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:31,769
- You can see Gibraltar.
- I would adore to see Gibraltar.

193
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:35,248
But I have a dog that needs exercise,
a cat that's losing its hair...

194
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:38,343
...a model who can't stand straight.
Maggie, please.

195
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:42,455
- There are no problems we can't overcome.
- I wish I could...

196
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,185
Why aren't you at the airport?

197
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:47,524
Because, Mrs. Allessio, I'm only mortal.
I'm not Apollo.

198
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:50,063
When God made me,
he gave me hands, not wings.

199
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:53,499
- What an oversight.
- Just sign it. I've got a car waiting.

200
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:56,127
- Hello, I'm Cecil.
- Steven Blackburn.

201
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:58,169
- Buying or selling?
- Begging.

202
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:02,133
How many times have I told you?
A customs declaration should be typed.

203
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,612
That would take forever, sweetie pie.
I only type with one finger...

204
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:06,773
...and I've hurt it.

205
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:08,578
Please don't tell me how.

206
00:16:09,418 --> 00:16:12,148
Vickie, you have a long distance call.
It's New York.

207
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:17,524
Get that to the airport. Tie it between
your teeth if need be. Teatime, Maggie.

208
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:19,584
Sam? How are you?

209
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,197
No, I'm fine. Yes. No.

210
00:16:22,297 --> 00:16:25,425
Let them run the ad.
They'll be there 11:00, your time.

211
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:27,927
Listen, Sam, are you standing up?

212
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,368
Then sit down, because what
I'm about to say will get you very excited.

213
00:16:32,474 --> 00:16:34,601
Guess where I'm going tomorrow. Spain.

214
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:37,202
- Marbella.
- It's near MÃ¡laga.

215
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,712
It's near MÃ¡laga.

216
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:43,080
No, I'm not going alone.
I'm going with a fella.

217
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:44,583
A very classy fella.

218
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:49,116
That doesn't make you excited.
Sam, you're getting old...

219
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:51,159
...because it excites the hell out of me.

220
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,561
Yes, I will do that. Goodbye.

221
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:58,128
I told him you're a classy fella. Are you?

222
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,959
I've got to be.
I live around the corner from Disraeli.

223
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:10,469
There we are.

224
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:11,570
Thank you.

225
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:12,944
Come on, Josie.

226
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,675
Here we are at last. Thank you, dear.

227
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:18,218
- Gently does it, Gloria.
- Thanks, Daddy.

228
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,221
Don't you think we should have wired
Steve we were coming?

229
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,657
Why spoil his fun?
This way he'll have a lovely surprise.

230
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:44,875
Good afternoon, I'm Miss Ramos.
Can I help you?

231
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:47,973
Good afternoon, Miss Ramos,
my name is Blackburn.

232
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,586
Reservations for two round-trip tickets
to MÃ¡laga, night flight tonight.

233
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,053
Thank you, Mr. Blackburn, I'll just check.

234
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:00,056
The seats are available, sir.

235
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:04,894
Charge mine to my travel card,
I'll pay cash for the other one.

236
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:07,458
Why not charge both tickets,
Mr. Blackburn?

237
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:12,333
This is a business card.
I charge my ticket to the business.

238
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:16,670
They pay for it and the other is
a surprise vacation trip for my mother.

239
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:19,076
- How nice. What's your mother's name?
- Vickie.

240
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:22,076
Vickie Allessio.

241
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,152
- Allessio?
- She remarried.

242
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:26,111
I'll get the tickets.

243
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:36,728
Here, one for Mr. Blackburn
and one for Mrs. Allessio.

244
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,696
I'll take that. I'm Mrs. Allessio.

245
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:43,794
Happy Mother's Day.

246
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:54,909
Just tell me one thing:

247
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:57,213
Why must you leave tonight...

248
00:18:57,286 --> 00:18:59,720
...on the very day
my parents arrive for a visit?

249
00:18:59,788 --> 00:19:04,054
Because when the S.S. Sera Magoso
rammed into the S.S. Antonio...

250
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:06,855
...ripping out its corkscrew
turbine rotor shaft...

251
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:10,797
...they didn't know about your parents,
or they would've avoided each another.

252
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:13,733
- You could send Braithwaite there.
- That's all I need now.

253
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:15,326
Why don't you both go down?

254
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,894
We didn't come to see you.

255
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:18,906
We came to be with our babies.

256
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:21,803
I'd love that, Grace,
but Gloria hates the place.

257
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:24,869
She can't stand the wind, the food.
Isn't that right, dear?

258
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:26,642
We were there last September.

259
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:29,377
- It was miserable.
- But in July, it's gorgeous.

260
00:19:29,451 --> 00:19:31,146
Really. You'll enjoy it.

261
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:34,284
Ask her nice, Steve.
You might have a pretty roommate.

262
00:19:34,823 --> 00:19:36,222
Why not try it, dear?

263
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:40,284
Maybe in July, it won't have the wind
and the lousy food and the heat.

264
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:43,421
- The flies.
- You think I can still get a ticket?

265
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:45,523
- That's another thing.
- That's easy.

266
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,193
- What are you flying?
- Iberian.

267
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,466
- You want me to call?
- No, I'll get it.

268
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,439
- Do you know the number?
- Yes, I do.

269
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:56,277
If you have any problems,
I know Valdez very well.

270
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:58,836
He runs the outfit.
He'd be glad to help you.

271
00:19:58,914 --> 00:20:01,314
Valdez. If I need him, I'll call him.

272
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:06,545
Hello, lberia, this is Mr. Blackburn.
I made a reservation.

273
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,590
Hello, Mr. Blackburn. This is Miss Ramos.

274
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:09,749
You're still on.

275
00:20:09,825 --> 00:20:12,055
Yes, I'm still on. Our night girl got sick.

276
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:16,361
I need one more ticket
on the MÃ¡laga flight for Mrs. Blackburn.

277
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,690
Your grandmother?

278
00:20:17,766 --> 00:20:18,790
My wife.

279
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:23,638
We can confirm that reservation.

280
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:27,731
The party will be you, your wife,
and your mother.

281
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,502
Thank you, Miss Ramos.

282
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,808
That's that.

283
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,550
Come on, dear. We'd better pack.

284
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:43,224
Just close the door, please. Come on, dog.

285
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,317
Quick, lovely ride in the car.

286
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:48,820
In you get. All right.

287
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:50,553
Good.

288
00:21:03,078 --> 00:21:04,102
Oh, dog.

289
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:06,639
When are you gonna learn to walk?

290
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,415
God, you're heavy.

291
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:13,587
Are you mad? What are you doing?

292
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:17,591
My mother is allergic to cats,
dogs and birds.

293
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:20,753
- See you next week.
- But I've got a dog, a cat and a bird.

294
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:24,663
Then you'll have two dogs, two cats
and two birds. Two of everything, Cecil.

295
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:26,195
Are they housebroken?

296
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,469
I can only vouch for the bird.

297
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:31,962
My God.

298
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:35,573
Come along.

299
00:21:47,022 --> 00:21:51,186
Gloria, have I ever criticized you
about the way you raise the children?

300
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,555
- No.
- Never?

301
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:58,626
But this time you're blowing it.
We'll return to two really screwed-up kids.

302
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:02,667
You know how your folks treat them.
Bicycles for this. Roller skates for that.

303
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,365
They bribe them for affection.

304
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:06,839
Remember when Billy came back
from a month with them?

305
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,069
He wouldn't smile until I gave him $3.

306
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:11,043
I'm telling you.

307
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:15,343
There's a time to think of yourself
and a time to think of the children.

308
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:19,214
- What's lberia's number?
- I'll do it.

309
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:27,222
I suppose there is
only one practical solution.

310
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:28,690
That's right.

311
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,968
- Hello, lberia, Miss Ramos?
- We'll take the kids with us.

312
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:36,903
This is Mr. Blackburn,
and we'll take the kids with us.

313
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,066
Take the kids with us?

314
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,103
You're right, darling.
They'll be better off with us.

315
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,936
- Are you serious?
- I'll make some excuse to my parents.

316
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,318
Make the reservation, darling.

317
00:22:54,923 --> 00:22:58,654
Miss Ramos, I'd like to add my son
and daughter to that party.

318
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:03,957
They're just little children.
Do you take them that late at night?

319
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,027
Yes, and I can confirm that for you now.

320
00:23:09,404 --> 00:23:10,530
Thank you.

321
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:18,069
We've just been confirmed.

322
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,170
Good.

323
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:22,347
And please make sure
they clean their teeth. 'Bye.

324
00:23:24,352 --> 00:23:25,842
The airport, please.

325
00:23:26,688 --> 00:23:30,124
Maria, get the children up and packed.
We're taking them to Marbella.

326
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:35,186
Maria, lay out their beach things.
I'll come and check it all, okay?

327
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,794
- I'll go help Maria.
- Just a second.

328
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:44,204
Hi, Miss Ramos, this is Mr. Blackburn.
I want two more seats.

329
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:47,003
Mr. And Mrs. Wendell Thompson.

330
00:23:47,742 --> 00:23:49,937
Yes, Miss Ramos, my in-laws.

331
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,510
- What are you doing?
- Just a minute, Miss Ramos.

332
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:56,449
You don't think they would miss a chance
to spoil their grandchildren, do you?

333
00:23:56,651 --> 00:24:00,018
They'll be down on the next plane,
if they have to buy the airline.

334
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:02,283
God, it's turning into a pilgrimage.

335
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:06,256
You'd better go down alone.

336
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,519
I think that makes sense, too.

337
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,730
Miss Ramos, cancel my in-laws,
my wife and my children.

338
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:15,229
Just you and Mother.

339
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:16,667
Roger.

340
00:24:27,182 --> 00:24:28,410
Are you free?

341
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,486
It's lberia. There's rather a lot. I think
if you went round it might be easier.

342
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,283
- Thanks. How much?
- &2, madam.

343
00:24:35,657 --> 00:24:37,215
- Goodbye.
- 'Bye.

344
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,788
- Thanks very much.
- Cheers.

345
00:25:02,517 --> 00:25:04,485
Hey, Steve. Steve.

346
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,548
- Over here, it's Walter.
- Hello, Walter.

347
00:25:09,491 --> 00:25:11,186
How are you doing?

348
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:13,452
- Where are you headed? MÃ¡laga?
- Yeah.

349
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:15,496
So am I. Who are you with?

350
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:16,920
Nobody.

351
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:21,494
- Good. We'll sit together on the plane.
- Swell.

352
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:25,437
That's terrific.
I hate to sit with strangers on a plane.

353
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:28,305
They try to tell you their life story.
They really annoy you.

354
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:29,365
You know what I mean?

355
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:45,319
- Gloria all right?
- Fine. Great.

356
00:25:45,427 --> 00:25:47,827
- And the children?
- The children are great.

357
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:51,794
Steve, there is something
I wanted to talk to you about.

358
00:25:52,367 --> 00:25:55,962
I got this screenplay ready to shoot.
It's a Western with weirdoes.

359
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:57,595
I got these Apaches...

360
00:25:57,672 --> 00:26:00,800
...and they start sucking this peyote root.
It drives them crazy.

361
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,968
Everyone starts banging everyone else.

362
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:06,605
It's got everything: Pot, sex, massacres,
orgies. Take the whole family.

363
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:08,808
It's gonna cost about $600,000.

364
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:12,182
Do you think Gloria's old man
would like to go in for about $200,000?

365
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:15,780
- What?
- The picture I just told you about.

366
00:26:15,957 --> 00:26:18,255
Sorry, Walt. That's my deaf side.

367
00:26:19,594 --> 00:26:23,724
Do you think Gloria's father
would invest $250,000 in my new picture?

368
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:25,389
- No.
- Are you sure?

369
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:28,225
Positive. He's been approached before.

370
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:32,173
You know something?
I liked you better when you couldn't hear.

371
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:43,714
I ordered a car, a Seat 124.

372
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:50,282
SeÃ±or Blackburn, if you complete
the papers, I'll get the keys.

373
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:53,792
- A Seat 124 is really a Fiat.
- Yes.

374
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:58,090
It's not a bad little car.
It'll hold all the luggage you have.

375
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,726
- Don't talk to me. Don't look at me.
- What?

376
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,635
- What's the matter?
- Steve, boy.

377
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:06,231
- That's what's the matter.
- Hi, Walter. Son of a bitch.

378
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:08,868
You'd think those customs guys
would know me by now.

379
00:27:08,943 --> 00:27:11,002
What a mess. Excuse me, Miss.

380
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:13,912
- I beg your pardon.
- Stand by, pal. I may need you.

381
00:27:13,982 --> 00:27:17,713
I'm Walter Menkes of Menkes Films.
I'd like a Seat 124.

382
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,514
I'm sorry. We don't have one car left.

383
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,790
You've got a car. A car.

384
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,255
- Yeah.
- Good, you can give me a lift.

385
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:30,128
You can find him a car.
He's a friend of mine.

386
00:27:30,198 --> 00:27:32,462
What's the sweat?
You drop me off at Los Monteros.

387
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:34,024
- They got cars.
- It's on your way.

388
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:36,696
- Patty and the kids are waiting.
- What about those cars?

389
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:39,262
- They're reserved.
- You must have something.

390
00:27:39,341 --> 00:27:42,970
We do have a Seat 600
that's just been returned.

391
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:45,439
But I'm a little nervous about the clutch.

392
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,739
- He'll take it.
- What do you mean?

393
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,851
You know what a 600 is?
It's a kiddie car. It's this big.

394
00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:53,545
- Oh, boy.
- You've got to step outside to shift gears.

395
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:55,452
You don't drive it. You mail it.

396
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,885
In the water,
it becomes an outboard motor.

397
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:59,324
All right, Walter.

398
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:01,656
You take my car. I'll take the 600.

399
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:05,189
- This is stupid.
- It's not stupid.

400
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:06,761
I'll drop you off.

401
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:09,668
- We'll have a nice ride, pleasant talk.
- It's no good.

402
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,760
Why not?

403
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:13,435
I've got this...

404
00:28:14,042 --> 00:28:16,772
I've got a trick back.
If someone else drives...

405
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:19,405
...it could easily go right into spasm.
- Spasm?

406
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,148
You know, you're a sick fellow
with the ear and the spasms.

407
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:27,210
It's 2:00 a.m. I have to drive two hours.
Please take the car.

408
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,256
- Can I at least buy you a meal?
- Sure.

409
00:28:29,324 --> 00:28:30,313
Tonight?

410
00:28:31,092 --> 00:28:32,491
- Great.
- Dinner?

411
00:28:33,328 --> 00:28:34,989
- Fine.
- Why should you be alone?

412
00:28:35,063 --> 00:28:38,362
We'll have a nice quiet evening.
Just you, me, Patty and the boys.

413
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:40,128
We'll have a fun evening.

414
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:43,967
- After dinner, I'll read you the screenplay.
- I look forward to it.

415
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:46,062
Miss?

416
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:49,435
- Can I give you a lift?
- Thank you. I'm being met.

417
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:58,515
You should go. It sounds like fun.

418
00:29:00,054 --> 00:29:01,316
What is this?

419
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:03,482
- Where do I sign?
- Here.

420
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:11,557
- Ever been in one of these?
- In Italy, when I was younger and shorter.

421
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,261
- Can you manage this?
- On my knee. Anything else?

422
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,769
Well, there's this.

423
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,970
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

424
00:29:22,977 --> 00:29:26,469
If the clutch gives you any trouble,
change the car in Marbella.

425
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:27,845
I'll keep it in mind.

426
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:29,747
- Have a pleasant trip.
- Bye-bye.

427
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,318
- Thank you.
- AdiÃ³s.

428
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:38,690
That's second, it's an Italian gearbox.

429
00:29:39,427 --> 00:29:42,954
- Thanks.
- No, that's third. First is up here.

430
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,624
- See?
- I see.

431
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:47,394
Good thing you're here.

432
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:48,925
- Ready?
- Yes.

433
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:49,992
- Nervous?
- No.

434
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:51,803
That's my girl.

435
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:06,345
It's a nice little car. It spins right along.

436
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:09,083
- You're still in first.
- Of course.

437
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:14,091
- Use the clutch.
- Right.

438
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,860
Sorry. I'm sorry.

439
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:18,929
There's a car coming.

440
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,872
There's a truck, it's trying to pass you.

441
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:30,439
Come on.

442
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:38,208
You're still in third.

443
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:39,947
- Would you like to drive?
- No.

444
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:41,750
- You sure?
- Positive.

445
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:44,154
Besides, I didn't bring my license.

446
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:58,266
For God's sake.

447
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:00,603
You'd think there'd be a porter
or something.

448
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:04,568
Leave the stuff here
and I'll come back for it.

449
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:06,876
It's all right.
I've always wanted long arms.

450
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:28,599
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

451
00:31:49,257 --> 00:31:50,485
Good morning, sir.

452
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:54,122
My name is Blackburn.
This is Mrs. Allessio.

453
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:57,091
- We ordered a suite.
- Un momento, seÃ±or.

454
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,367
I'm sorry, Mr. Blackburn...

455
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:07,541
...but there's no reservation for a suite.
It's a room. A double room.

456
00:32:11,446 --> 00:32:14,745
- Any objections?
- Anything, as long as I can see Gibraltar.

457
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,152
- Will we see Gibraltar?
- SÃ­, seÃ±or.

458
00:32:19,721 --> 00:32:21,154
This way, please.

459
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,517
Just one moment, please. What is that?

460
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:55,054
What is what?

461
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:57,751
Does Gibraltar
have washing hanging all over it?

462
00:32:57,825 --> 00:32:59,156
What are you talking about?

463
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,025
Because if it doesn't,
we don't have a view of Gibraltar.

464
00:33:02,096 --> 00:33:03,791
What do we have a view of?

465
00:33:03,865 --> 00:33:06,299
Roughly, I'd say the laundry.

466
00:33:07,135 --> 00:33:10,798
Don't be ridiculous. They don't even have
big laundries down here.

467
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:13,733
- What is that out there?
- It's the laundry.

468
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:14,934
It's the laundry.

469
00:33:15,543 --> 00:33:18,103
I told you we want to see Gibraltar.

470
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:21,509
We want a room with a view of Gibraltar,
comprende?

471
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:24,416
SÃ­, seÃ±or.

472
00:33:53,815 --> 00:33:56,511
What we'd like, seÃ±or,
is a room with a view...

473
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:59,777
...and a toilet with a seat.
That's not asking too much, is it?

474
00:34:43,097 --> 00:34:44,121
Vickie?

475
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,731
Why don't we unpack in the morning?

476
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,805
- Aren't you tired?
- Only of unpacking.

477
00:34:53,207 --> 00:34:54,231
I see.

478
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:00,505
Very well.

479
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,938
- Would you like that light on or off?
- Whichever you prefer.

480
00:36:14,355 --> 00:36:16,255
- How about on?
- Certainly.

481
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,000
Would you do me a very big favor?

482
00:36:28,336 --> 00:36:30,429
I thought that's what I was doing.

483
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:32,665
Would you mind getting on the other side?

484
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,435
What's wrong with this side?

485
00:36:34,508 --> 00:36:37,671
Nothing, it's just more natural for me
being on that side.

486
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:40,773
I don't want to cause
an international incident...

487
00:36:40,848 --> 00:36:44,375
...but it's more natural for me this side.
We always started this way.

488
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,317
- We?
- Me and my Italian.

489
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:49,220
He had this tennis elbow
and a bad shoulder and...

490
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,884
Anyway, I just got used to this side.

491
00:36:55,263 --> 00:36:57,094
It doesn't work for me.

492
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,569
- Why not?
- I'm deaf in my left ear.

493
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,200
What's that got to do with it?

494
00:37:05,273 --> 00:37:08,333
- I won't be able to hear you.
- I'm not going to say very much.

495
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:11,344
You're going to breathe.
Sometimes that sounds pretty good.

496
00:37:11,412 --> 00:37:15,178
Who knows? A word of encouragement
may slip out, it could do wonders.

497
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,908
- Shall I walk around?
- What?

498
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,179
Shall I walk around?

499
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:23,053
Why don't you slip over
and I'll slide under?

500
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:26,184
No, I think it's better if I slip under
and you slide over.

501
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,820
Why don't we just kind of roll towards...

502
00:37:28,896 --> 00:37:33,230
It's getting awfully late. Why don't you
just get on top and hope for the best?

503
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:38,634
- I've heard it put more romantically.
- Indeed.

504
00:37:46,914 --> 00:37:48,643
Christ, you're beautiful.

505
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:58,822
- My God, you can see Gibraltar.
- Where?

506
00:38:02,129 --> 00:38:04,063
- What's the matter?
- Spasm.

507
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:05,826
- I'm in spasm.
- What do you mean?

508
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,097
You think you're in spasm
and you're not in spasm, and I'm in spasm.

509
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,331
- Oh, boy.
- What do I do?

510
00:38:11,405 --> 00:38:14,306
I think you better call the doctor.
Get the doctor.

511
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,070
Don't move. Please, don't move.

512
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:20,102
- How do I get the doctor if I don't move?
- Very slowly, that's all. Very slowly.

513
00:38:22,817 --> 00:38:24,717
Oh, God!

514
00:38:29,457 --> 00:38:31,220
Buenos dÃ­as, seÃ±oras, seÃ±ores.

515
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:33,817
Another beautiful day on the Costa del Sol.

516
00:38:40,434 --> 00:38:43,528
I can't reach the phone. If you can just...

517
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,032
I've got the phone.

518
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,845
Help! What's doctor in Spanish?

519
00:38:52,947 --> 00:38:56,883
- What is Spanish for doctor?
- II dottore.

520
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,946
- You sure?
- I think so.

521
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,012
- It sounds Italian.
- Well, maybe it's Italian. It's foreign.

522
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:05,548
- You tell them.
- Please, I'm in spasm.

523
00:39:05,626 --> 00:39:07,958
- He's in spasm.
- Could you send a doctor?

524
00:39:08,662 --> 00:39:10,289
Easy.

525
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,690
Gently.

526
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,662
Now, what precisely were you doing
when this thing happened?

527
00:39:21,075 --> 00:39:22,508
I was sort of...

528
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,441
We were making love.

529
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:26,876
We were making love.

530
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:30,782
So, in the middle of making love
with this woman...

531
00:39:31,419 --> 00:39:33,717
...you turned to see Gibraltar.

532
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:35,888
- SÃ­?
- SÃ­.

533
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,651
I see.

534
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:43,964
Now, I'm going to turn you over, so relax.

535
00:39:44,098 --> 00:39:46,726
Very gently. Gently.

536
00:39:47,334 --> 00:39:48,961
Okay, it's coming.

537
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,531
Relax. That's it.

538
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:54,574
- Would you give me a hand with the foot?
- Hand with the foot?

539
00:39:54,675 --> 00:39:56,575
Yes, give him a hand with the foot.

540
00:39:57,611 --> 00:40:00,171
Very gently. Relax.

541
00:40:07,955 --> 00:40:09,047
How do you feel?

542
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:13,792
Better. Better.

543
00:40:14,762 --> 00:40:18,061
Good. Now you can put him
back in the bed.

544
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,358
Thank you.

545
00:40:24,572 --> 00:40:26,369
Easy. Gently.

546
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:31,808
Give him this.

547
00:40:32,279 --> 00:40:34,213
- This?
- To sleep.

548
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,116
- To sleep.
- Rest good.

549
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:41,545
And do not try to make love again
until you can touch your toes.

550
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:44,557
- Touch my toes?
- Like this.

551
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:53,095
Then everything will be all right. AdiÃ³s.

552
00:40:53,834 --> 00:40:55,324
- AdiÃ³s.
- AdiÃ³s.

553
00:40:56,137 --> 00:40:57,434
Gracias.

554
00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:02,104
Muchas gracias.

555
00:41:02,776 --> 00:41:04,767
Can I have the pills, please?

556
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,344
How are you enjoying the trip so far?

557
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:09,949
Nice.

558
00:41:11,752 --> 00:41:13,652
That's what I thought.

559
00:41:19,026 --> 00:41:21,494
Aren't you going to get under the covers?

560
00:41:23,364 --> 00:41:24,922
No.

561
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,595
I see. Nice.

562
00:41:41,782 --> 00:41:44,979
Mom, can I have one of these?
All the guys have them.

563
00:41:45,286 --> 00:41:46,981
No, no, no.

564
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:49,987
Why not, Mom?

565
00:41:54,195 --> 00:41:56,425
Excuse me, do you speak English?

566
00:41:56,497 --> 00:41:58,727
I try, but I'm an American.

567
00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:01,825
I have a son about the same size as yours.
Could I borrow him?

568
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:05,463
- You can have him all day if you want to.
- Thanks. Do you mind?

569
00:42:07,308 --> 00:42:09,105
- Are you British?
- Yes.

570
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:10,871
- From London? Me, too.
- Yes.

571
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,073
We've been living there for years.
What did you say your name was?

572
00:42:14,148 --> 00:42:16,616
Well, I didn't.
But it's Allessio, Vickie Allessio.

573
00:42:16,684 --> 00:42:17,776
Thanks very much.

574
00:42:17,851 --> 00:42:20,081
- Where are you staying?
- Guadalmina.

575
00:42:20,254 --> 00:42:23,655
Maybe you and Mr. Allessio would have
dinner with my husband and me.

576
00:42:23,724 --> 00:42:27,888
Well, that's very kind of you,
but I'm afraid I'm right out of Mr. Allessios.

577
00:42:29,663 --> 00:42:32,154
- Are you here alone?
- Yes.

578
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:35,634
- That makes it easier.
- It doesn't actually.

579
00:42:35,736 --> 00:42:39,263
Because I'm here for a sort of a rest.

580
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,968
And I'm on a diet. And you know how it is.

581
00:42:42,276 --> 00:42:44,301
Thanks for the use of the chest.

582
00:42:44,411 --> 00:42:47,107
Mrs. Allessio, how do you spell that?

583
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:49,513
Two L's, two S's and I'm out a lot.

584
00:42:51,885 --> 00:42:53,443
No.

585
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:42,759
Hello.

586
00:43:46,173 --> 00:43:47,401
How are you feeling?

587
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:51,075
- I can touch my toes.
- Can you?

588
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:04,489
You do realize
that I've just greased myself...

589
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:07,857
...with two tubes of very expensive
suntan oil?

590
00:44:07,928 --> 00:44:10,362
I couldn't help noticing.

591
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:18,435
Pardon me for asking, but did you always
get what you want when you wanted it?

592
00:44:18,872 --> 00:44:20,840
Even before I knew what to do with it.

593
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,812
If we are going to eat,
and I really think we...

594
00:44:32,886 --> 00:44:34,945
Are you still asleep?

595
00:44:35,723 --> 00:44:37,748
I feel marvelous.

596
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:41,352
I fell asleep before I could say thanks.

597
00:44:42,529 --> 00:44:44,463
How do you feel?

598
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,492
Fine. But they do stop serving lunch
in 10 minutes.

599
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:48,967
Everything okay?

600
00:44:49,036 --> 00:44:51,527
I booked a table,
but you know what they're like.

601
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,301
You know what I mean.
How was it for you?

602
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:55,933
Very nice.

603
00:44:57,077 --> 00:44:58,806
- "Very nice"?
- Yes.

604
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,814
- Just "very nice"?
- What's wrong with "very nice"?

605
00:45:07,821 --> 00:45:12,417
"Very nice" is hardly the phrase to describe
two bodies locked in heavenly transport.

606
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:15,890
You wouldn't chisel "very nice" in granite
under Rodin's The Kiss.

607
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:19,763
"Very nice" is when you get a get well card
from the butcher or TV repairman.

608
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:21,266
That's "very nice."

609
00:45:21,335 --> 00:45:25,601
But for what we just did, the comments
range from lousy to sensational.

610
00:45:25,672 --> 00:45:27,936
The rockets went off or the earth moved.

611
00:45:28,008 --> 00:45:29,600
For God's sake.

612
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:32,838
These things take time.
This is a body not a machine.

613
00:45:32,913 --> 00:45:35,814
You don't just press a button
and "Pow! " the earth moves.

614
00:45:35,883 --> 00:45:39,410
- It moved pretty good for me.
- Well, lucky you.

615
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:45,388
God, you are all the same.
This obsession with male sexual prowess.

616
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:47,959
It is so typically American.

617
00:45:48,028 --> 00:45:50,553
- Is it?
- It is, if you don't mind me telling you.

618
00:45:50,631 --> 00:45:52,758
I don't mind you telling me. Not a bit.

619
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,393
It's that phrase I can't stand,
"Typically American."

620
00:45:55,469 --> 00:45:56,128
Why not?

621
00:45:56,203 --> 00:45:58,831
Because there's no such thing
as "typically American."

622
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:03,067
It's a big place. Which "typically
American" Americans do you mean?

623
00:46:03,143 --> 00:46:06,135
The cab drivers in New York?
The coalminers in Pennsylvania?

624
00:46:06,213 --> 00:46:09,979
The students at Berkeley? The Mormons
in Utah? The Harlem Globetrotters?

625
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:12,848
The daughters of the American Revolution,
you mean those?

626
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,650
I'll tell you,
they're all throwing rocks at each other.

627
00:46:15,722 --> 00:46:18,850
The only thing "typically American"
about 200 million Americans...

628
00:46:18,926 --> 00:46:23,488
...is that they never do anything "typically"
alike and that goes for humping, too.

629
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:27,531
Well, of course. I've had it off
with all 200 million of them.

630
00:46:27,634 --> 00:46:29,602
Don't be an idiot.

631
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,301
Why are you so angry?
The earth moved for you.

632
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,806
I've never seen anyone
change so fast in my life.

633
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,342
I haven't changed a bit.

634
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:40,904
I'm the same sweet, sex-crazed
"typical American" I was 20 minutes ago!

635
00:46:41,915 --> 00:46:44,281
And just remember this:

636
00:46:44,351 --> 00:46:47,343
There is no better way for a man
to start the day...

637
00:46:47,421 --> 00:46:50,413
...than with that bracing, glowing,
ego-building feeling...

638
00:46:50,491 --> 00:46:53,551
...of knowing that he has struck out
in the sack.

639
00:46:53,694 --> 00:46:56,561
"Struck out in the sack" is, I assume...

640
00:46:56,697 --> 00:47:00,656
...a mixed metaphor,
undoubtedly American, and probably nasty.

641
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,634
- It'll do.
- And may I point out...

642
00:47:02,703 --> 00:47:06,161
...as you have never noticed,
women are a little different from men.

643
00:47:06,373 --> 00:47:09,433
- They require time. A little sensitivity.
- English women.

644
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:10,875
All women!

645
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:14,344
Anybody but a superannuated Boy Scout
would know that.

646
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:18,441
End of conversation. Oh, boy!

647
00:47:18,952 --> 00:47:21,853
- "Oh, boy" what?
- Nothing.

648
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:27,823
It just takes time to know a person.

649
00:47:27,895 --> 00:47:31,228
- It certainly does.
- Time and trouble.

650
00:47:31,665 --> 00:47:33,997
Lots of time and lots of trouble.

651
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:35,796
- Right.
- Do you want lunch?

652
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:39,168
- Just a sandwich. I'm playing golf.
- Good. I'll trail along.

653
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:42,265
- You don't have to.
- No, but I could use the exercise.

654
00:47:42,409 --> 00:47:45,378
I'll say. God knows,
you didn't get any this morning.

655
00:48:32,859 --> 00:48:36,727
Enrique, 100 for the first nine,
100 for the second, 100 for the 18th.

656
00:48:36,797 --> 00:48:38,230
- Â¿Comprende?
- SÃ­, seÃ±or.

657
00:48:38,298 --> 00:48:40,562
- Mucho bene.
- I shall win though.

658
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,974
Are you gambling with this child?

659
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:50,271
It's not gambling.
These kids have Spanish pride.

660
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,437
So instead of tipping him, I let him win.

661
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:55,538
- So he wins, does he?
- Yeah, if he can.

662
00:48:55,616 --> 00:48:56,913
I see.

663
00:48:59,419 --> 00:49:02,684
- What is that supposed to mean?
- What is what supposed to mean?

664
00:49:02,756 --> 00:49:06,556
"I see." That supercilious, cold-assed,
English way of saying "I see."

665
00:49:06,627 --> 00:49:08,925
It means I'm delighted
the boy has a chance to win.

666
00:49:08,996 --> 00:49:12,796
I'd hate to witness a grown man
who has to beat an 8-year-old child.

667
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:16,135
He's 13, smokes cigarettes,
goes to the flamenco dancer...

668
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,671
...and he gives me two shots aside.
- Â¡OlÃ©!

669
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:27,613
- You gonna count that?
- You play four.

670
00:49:27,681 --> 00:49:30,343
- She was talking to me.
- You lie three, you play four.

671
00:49:34,621 --> 00:49:38,955
You know, winning is not that important.
You learn that as you go through life.

672
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:44,057
That's right. It's how you play the game.

673
00:49:56,443 --> 00:49:57,535
Nice shot.

674
00:50:04,818 --> 00:50:06,251
Nice shot.

675
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,186
- Muy bien.
- Try and stay off the green, will you?

676
00:50:18,398 --> 00:50:19,592
What is it?

677
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,358
My cousins want to bet on me.

678
00:50:21,501 --> 00:50:23,594
- Your cousins want to bet on you?
- SÃ­.

679
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,537
- Starting from here?
- SÃ­.

680
00:50:25,706 --> 00:50:27,401
- Hundred, hundred, hundred?
- SÃ­.

681
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,939
- They're gonna give me two shots aside?
- SÃ­.

682
00:50:30,343 --> 00:50:31,435
It's their money.

683
00:50:45,258 --> 00:50:47,726
SeÃ±or, my cousins' friends
would like to bet on me.

684
00:50:47,928 --> 00:50:50,260
- Your cousins' friends want to bet on you?
- SÃ­.

685
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,195
- Same action as before?
- SÃ­.

686
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,364
Okay, kid.

687
00:50:59,506 --> 00:51:01,474
- Hey, seÃ±or.
- What is it?

688
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:04,508
My cousins' friends' cousins
would like to bet on me.

689
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:07,102
- Your cousins' friends' cousins?
- SÃ­.

690
00:51:07,214 --> 00:51:08,909
- Same action as before?
- SÃ­.

691
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:11,442
Okay, kid. Get out the way you got in.

692
00:52:32,365 --> 00:52:33,127
Vale.

693
00:52:51,151 --> 00:52:52,175
PerdÃ³name.

694
00:53:00,894 --> 00:53:03,089
What are you doing? What's all this?

695
00:53:03,396 --> 00:53:04,727
Here is your money.

696
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:10,528
Forget it. I just got lucky.
You win a few, you lose a few. Here.

697
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:15,735
Buy the boys a drink. See you later.

698
00:53:27,087 --> 00:53:28,452
What's bugging you now?

699
00:53:28,922 --> 00:53:31,948
- Apart from the fact you're still in second?
- Yes.

700
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:35,720
All right. This isn't a romantic holiday,
it's a proving ground.

701
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:39,390
I think you brought me here for
the same reason you had to beat that kid.

702
00:53:39,499 --> 00:53:40,898
- You do, huh?
- I do, "huh."

703
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:43,435
And I think your wife
gives you two shots aside...

704
00:53:43,503 --> 00:53:45,664
...and she's not happy in the end, either.

705
00:53:45,739 --> 00:53:49,266
Let's get one thing straight,
since I came with you, not Freud...

706
00:53:49,342 --> 00:53:53,142
...which was my first mistake,
I've had all the amateur analysis I can take.

707
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:56,543
- Is that clear?
- Perfectly, and you're still in second.

708
00:54:09,095 --> 00:54:11,393
I'm going to MÃ¡laga
to take care of my business.

709
00:54:11,464 --> 00:54:13,762
I figure I'll eat out. Alone.

710
00:54:14,634 --> 00:54:16,101
You'll enjoy the company.

711
00:54:24,244 --> 00:54:25,176
Hey, Steve!

712
00:54:25,779 --> 00:54:29,146
I just called your room.
I wanted to see if you're still free tonight.

713
00:54:29,816 --> 00:54:31,374
- I sure am, Walter.
- Good.

714
00:54:31,584 --> 00:54:33,245
Antonio's at the port at 8:30.

715
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,049
- Good. See you then.
- Okay.

716
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,883
- Where are you going?
- Business.

717
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:38,482
How's the clutch?

718
00:54:38,558 --> 00:54:40,082
- What?
- The clutch!

719
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,525
- Fine!
- Okay.

720
00:54:48,401 --> 00:54:49,163
Hello.

721
00:54:49,235 --> 00:54:50,725
- Miss Allessio?
- Yes.

722
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:54,237
This is the lady you met this morning.
The one with the little boy.

723
00:54:54,441 --> 00:54:56,375
- You borrowed his chest.
- How are you?

724
00:54:56,643 --> 00:54:59,840
Would you like to go to dinner
with my husband and me tonight?

725
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,703
That would be very nice.

726
00:55:01,982 --> 00:55:04,041
Great. We'll pick you up at about 8:15.

727
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,512
I'll look forward to it.

728
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:34,046
- Good evening, sir.
- Mr. Menkes' table.

729
00:55:34,948 --> 00:55:37,439
Hey, Steve, over here!

730
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:39,342
Hello, Walter.

731
00:55:44,624 --> 00:55:46,353
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's all right.

732
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,519
- Hello, Patty.
- Hi, Steve. How are you?

733
00:55:50,063 --> 00:55:51,690
Steve, this is Vickie Allessio.

734
00:55:52,165 --> 00:55:53,792
You two are in the same hotel.

735
00:55:54,634 --> 00:55:56,067
This is Steve Blackburn.

736
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,494
Mr. Blackburn.

737
00:55:57,804 --> 00:55:59,101
Mrs. Allessio.

738
00:56:08,915 --> 00:56:11,748
We're off and running.
But you've got to be careful.

739
00:56:12,152 --> 00:56:14,882
He's a slow starter, but he finishes fast.
So watch out.

740
00:56:14,988 --> 00:56:17,456
- Wally.
- What's wrong?

741
00:56:18,191 --> 00:56:20,659
They're two healthy people,
down here on their own.

742
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,957
No ties. No responsibilities.
It makes your mouth water.

743
00:56:24,898 --> 00:56:25,956
Wally.

744
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:29,134
What do you want to drink?

745
00:56:29,269 --> 00:56:32,204
- Whatever Mrs. Allessio wants.
- Whatever Mr. Blackburn wants.

746
00:56:33,339 --> 00:56:36,433
- What about sangria?
- Yes. They say sangria's great.

747
00:56:36,509 --> 00:56:37,533
- Lovely.
- Fine.

748
00:56:38,878 --> 00:56:39,776
Â¡Camarero!

749
00:56:41,014 --> 00:56:43,209
It's very Spanish. We're here.

750
00:56:52,358 --> 00:56:53,848
Could I have some water?

751
00:56:54,694 --> 00:56:55,922
Â¡Camarero!

752
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,539
I was just telling Wally this afternoon,
it's a shame Steve's wife couldn't come.

753
00:57:11,611 --> 00:57:13,476
You'd just love her. Wouldn't she?

754
00:57:13,546 --> 00:57:15,309
- They'd love each other.
- Really?

755
00:57:15,448 --> 00:57:16,847
She's such an amazing girl.

756
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:19,484
She's had every advantage,
and you'd never know.

757
00:57:19,886 --> 00:57:21,820
No pretenses, no airs.

758
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,283
She sounds wonderful.

759
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,551
- Why didn't you bring her?
- I wish I had.

760
00:57:26,326 --> 00:57:28,954
You'd never get Gloria to leave those kids.

761
00:57:29,496 --> 00:57:32,954
She devotes herself to them,
night and day. Especially the little one.

762
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,531
- How old is Josie now?
- Seven.

763
00:57:35,768 --> 00:57:38,259
Cute as a button, but she's got a bit of a...

764
00:57:38,505 --> 00:57:41,406
- What is it, a metabolism problem?
- Metabolism.

765
00:57:41,474 --> 00:57:42,270
Oh, dear.

766
00:57:42,408 --> 00:57:44,842
- So she's a little on the heavy side.
- Of course.

767
00:57:45,411 --> 00:57:46,776
Could I have some more wine?

768
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:48,578
Â¡Camarero!

769
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:52,515
But Josie's really a lovely girl,
and once she finishes at the orthodontist...

770
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,209
...she's gonna be gorgeous.

771
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,786
She has crooked teeth?

772
00:57:56,422 --> 00:57:59,186
I think there's something more interesting
to talk about...

773
00:57:59,259 --> 00:58:01,989
...than my daughter's metabolism rate
or fixing her teeth.

774
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:05,959
We could talk about my kids' teeth,
but they don't stop eating long enough...

775
00:58:06,032 --> 00:58:07,363
...to get them fixed.

776
00:58:12,005 --> 00:58:13,472
Did I say something wrong?

777
00:58:21,347 --> 00:58:22,211
Oh, boy.

778
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:26,150
There you go "oh, boying" again.
What's bothering Mr. Sensitive now?

779
00:58:26,219 --> 00:58:28,949
What do you know about sensitivity,
picking on a child?

780
00:58:29,022 --> 00:58:33,152
I did not. I'm sure she's a lovely girl.
A lovely fat girl with crooked teeth.

781
00:58:33,226 --> 00:58:36,024
- They're not crooked. Just overlapping.
- That's crooked.

782
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:42,666
- This is ridiculous. Let's call a truce.
- Fine by me.

783
00:58:44,571 --> 00:58:48,735
You are extraordinary. I've never known
an adult who could be hurt so easily.

784
00:58:48,808 --> 00:58:51,402
- Do you come from a large family?
- Yes, I do.

785
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,440
Lots of brothers and sisters?
There you are, then.

786
00:58:54,881 --> 00:58:57,349
Your mother spent too much time
with the others.

787
00:58:57,417 --> 00:58:59,385
Is this a seminar on family relations?

788
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:02,182
You finish chopping up my daughter,
you start on my mother.

789
00:59:02,255 --> 00:59:05,588
It's a strange time
to start attacking someone's mother.

790
00:59:05,658 --> 00:59:08,855
- I wasn't attacking. I was talking.
- I don't call that talking.

791
00:59:08,928 --> 00:59:12,261
- Tearing up a lady who never did you harm.
- I don't believe this!

792
00:59:12,665 --> 00:59:15,429
She was a marvelous woman.
And I'll tell you this:

793
00:59:15,535 --> 00:59:19,335
We weren't the richest kids,
but I never went to school in a dirty shirt.

794
00:59:19,405 --> 00:59:20,599
Dear God!

795
00:59:21,074 --> 00:59:24,202
Polio shots.
First electric blanket on the block.

796
00:59:24,577 --> 00:59:26,044
Great food in the winter.

797
00:59:26,546 --> 00:59:29,014
You lie there and hack away
at a woman like that.

798
00:59:29,082 --> 00:59:31,448
Suddenly, I'm in bed with your mother.

799
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,150
In bed with my mother?

800
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,648
That's the most disgusting thing
I've ever heard in my life.

801
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:41,327
- What are you doing now?
- I'm leaving the sanatorium.

802
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:42,927
I've had enough therapy.

803
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:46,859
- I'm going back to London, tonight.
- It'll do us both the world of good.

804
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:50,365
You bet your ass.
What a washout this has been.

805
00:59:51,237 --> 00:59:53,398
I'm gonna press it in my book of memories.

806
00:59:53,773 --> 00:59:57,766
You should have been a worm.
A cestode worm. You know why?

807
00:59:58,244 --> 01:00:02,044
Because it has a complete set
of male and female sexual organs...

808
01:00:02,115 --> 01:00:06,814
...in each of its 100 sections,
and spends its life copulating with itself.

809
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,451
Wouldn't that be lovely? You could've
taken you away for a weekend.

810
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:13,720
You'd have had you all to yourself.
And all those questions.

811
01:00:13,793 --> 01:00:17,388
"Was I good? You were wonderful.
Did the earth move? The house collapsed.

812
01:00:17,597 --> 01:00:20,327
"Am I manly?
No, but you're a great worm."

813
01:00:20,566 --> 01:00:22,557
You missed your profession: A worm.

814
01:00:22,669 --> 01:00:25,797
Crawling and humping its way through life,
and badly.

815
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:27,699
Thank you.

816
01:00:28,841 --> 01:00:31,332
- Where are you going?
- London. It's where I live.

817
01:00:31,444 --> 01:00:32,809
You can leave tomorrow.

818
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:36,675
I've had this place with or without you,
and even if we must go together...

819
01:00:36,749 --> 01:00:39,912
...I am going home to my thin children,
with their straight teeth.

820
01:00:39,986 --> 01:00:41,214
You can go tomorrow.

821
01:00:41,287 --> 01:00:44,688
- I am going now!
- All right. Okay.

822
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:49,758
But I don't want to hear one more word
out of you ever. Is that understood?

823
01:00:49,929 --> 01:00:53,956
Perfectly. So listen very clearly,
because this is the last thing I will say:

824
01:00:54,467 --> 01:00:56,162
Make a reservation.

825
01:00:56,636 --> 01:00:58,126
Not necessary.

826
01:00:58,271 --> 01:01:01,798
And if you're not downstairs in 10 minutes,
I'm leaving without you.

827
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:06,302
You can stay here and find another worm,
and hold another seminar.

828
01:01:22,128 --> 01:01:24,392
- Can I help you, sir?
- Flight 826 to London.

829
01:01:24,664 --> 01:01:27,792
- Two tickets, please.
- Flight 826 to London is full.

830
01:01:27,967 --> 01:01:30,868
- Flight 826 to London is never full.
- It is tonight, sir.

831
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:34,031
- When did the last two tickets go?
- Just a few moments ago.

832
01:01:35,675 --> 01:01:37,734
Press that in your book of memories.

833
01:01:38,578 --> 01:01:41,945
- When is the next plane to London?
- 11:30, tomorrow morning.

834
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:44,840
11:30, tomorrow morning.

835
01:01:49,322 --> 01:01:52,450
- Can I help you, miss?
- Thank you, I'm getting very good at this.

836
01:01:56,195 --> 01:01:57,628
- Good night.
- Good night.

837
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,876
Welcome to the house of mirth.

838
01:02:20,686 --> 01:02:23,712
One phone call. One stupid phone call.

839
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:27,558
It would've cost seven pesetas.
You could've won that from your caddie.

840
01:02:27,627 --> 01:02:28,389
Oh, yeah?

841
01:02:28,461 --> 01:02:31,021
I've had a bellyful
of your chicken-shit innuendos...

842
01:02:31,097 --> 01:02:33,657
...your snotty insults,
and your smart-assed needling.

843
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,630
Get stuffed, you big schmuck.

844
01:02:37,437 --> 01:02:40,133
Listen to Princess Grace, here.
Bertha Ball-Buster.

845
01:02:40,206 --> 01:02:42,902
You're as tender,
sweet and feminine as Attila the Hun.

846
01:02:42,975 --> 01:02:46,103
- Well, you should know.
- You should have a uniform and a whistle.

847
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:49,706
You direct traffic in bed, out of bed,
on the phone, in the car.

848
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,075
Talk about penis envy. You invented it.

849
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,844
- Now!
- Now.

850
01:02:58,724 --> 01:03:00,021
Don't break the lamp!

851
01:03:10,269 --> 01:03:12,829
You typical American!

852
01:03:15,775 --> 01:03:17,834
Is this a way to treat a hotel?

853
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:21,535
Don't do it!

854
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,723
Thank you very much. Good night.

855
01:03:36,429 --> 01:03:39,023
- Now, Mr. Know-All!
- Okay.

856
01:04:29,048 --> 01:04:33,178
For God's sake. My chance to be raped,
you can't get your trousers off.

857
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,557
Isn't that Vickie and Steve?

858
01:05:54,166 --> 01:05:57,966
- I guess they're getting together.
- I hope we haven't started something.

859
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:01,301
With Steve? Not a chance.
He's probably selling her a policy.

860
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:15,854
She just grabbed his arm.

861
01:06:15,921 --> 01:06:18,719
What should she grab? She just met him.
Watch the bull.

862
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:37,239
Â¡OlÃ©!

863
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:42,066
- Don't tell me they weren't holding hands.
- You're fantastic.

864
01:07:42,508 --> 01:07:45,875
Two people reach for a peanut
at the same time, they're holding hands.

865
01:07:45,945 --> 01:07:48,812
- You got a mind like a house detective.
- You should know.

866
01:07:49,181 --> 01:07:52,708
Just pass me the potato chips.
After you've checked them for fingerprints.

867
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:55,579
Oh, boy.

868
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:00,121
"Got no pajamas with my monogram

869
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:04,229
"And just like Papa, I am what I am

870
01:08:04,396 --> 01:08:09,333
"But she loves me
She told me she loved me last night

871
01:08:09,769 --> 01:08:12,101
"Oh, last night, oh, yes

872
01:08:12,204 --> 01:08:17,335
"She loves me
She told me so last night

873
01:08:17,576 --> 01:08:19,874
"Oh, last night

874
01:08:20,379 --> 01:08:24,816
"She loves me
She told me so last night"

875
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,823
- That's really awful.
- I thought it was beautiful.

876
01:08:32,091 --> 01:08:35,219
- Were you in love when you wrote it?
- Yes. I was 18, in college.

877
01:08:35,294 --> 01:08:37,353
- I was always in love. Weren't you?
- No.

878
01:08:37,429 --> 01:08:39,021
- Even at 18?
- No.

879
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,094
When did you first fall in love?

880
01:08:41,167 --> 01:08:42,600
- I didn't.
- What?

881
01:08:42,668 --> 01:08:46,229
That blind, passionate, all-out
whatever-it-is you're supposed to feel...

882
01:08:46,305 --> 01:08:49,103
...is something I have never felt.
Maybe I'm incapable.

883
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,573
I don't believe that.

884
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:55,711
Why not? After all, I'm your everyday
cold-assed, supercilious English woman.

885
01:08:56,248 --> 01:08:57,840
I'm terribly sorry I said that.

886
01:08:57,950 --> 01:09:00,145
Don't be. It warmed things up quite a bit.

887
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:03,420
It did? Well, I'm very pleased to hear that.

888
01:09:03,522 --> 01:09:04,682
Mr. Blackburn.

889
01:09:06,458 --> 01:09:09,154
- What is it?
- Your tickets to London are confirmed.

890
01:09:10,362 --> 01:09:13,024
No. We don't leave until the 26th.

891
01:09:13,532 --> 01:09:16,262
This is the 26th, seÃ±or. You leave at 5:00.

892
01:09:21,006 --> 01:09:21,870
Thank you.

893
01:09:35,154 --> 01:09:38,248
- Shall we take a swim?
- Yes, please.

894
01:09:48,901 --> 01:09:49,560
Hey!

895
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:51,859
Look alive.

896
01:09:52,338 --> 01:09:55,865
Ready when you are. Lights and camera.

897
01:09:56,175 --> 01:09:57,073
All right.

898
01:09:59,378 --> 01:10:02,040
- Action.
- Steve! Hey, Steve!

899
01:10:09,088 --> 01:10:11,921
What's so important,
you have to crash in without calling?

900
01:10:11,991 --> 01:10:14,585
Are you a dentist? I need an appointment?
It's business.

901
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:17,493
- There's nothing about your business...
- It's not my business.

902
01:10:17,563 --> 01:10:20,191
It's too intelligent,
keeping my nose in my own business.

903
01:10:20,266 --> 01:10:23,167
This is none of my business.
You and the lady.

904
01:10:23,235 --> 01:10:26,033
- What are you talking about?
- The bullfight, the beach...

905
01:10:26,105 --> 01:10:28,471
...the restaurant.
You could've taken out an ad.

906
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:30,132
What are we doing? Where you going?

907
01:10:30,209 --> 01:10:32,939
Steve, I'm gonna tell you something.
How do you want it?

908
01:10:33,012 --> 01:10:36,140
In front of her, here?
Or up there, all by ourselves?

909
01:10:50,629 --> 01:10:53,291
Listen carefully, Steve.
I know what I'm talking about.

910
01:10:53,365 --> 01:10:55,356
I'm one of the walking wounded.

911
01:10:56,101 --> 01:10:57,193
It's true.

912
01:10:57,436 --> 01:11:00,303
Even a schlep like me
gets a little action once in a while.

913
01:11:00,372 --> 01:11:02,932
Most of it is tired quail
that fly south the next day.

914
01:11:03,275 --> 01:11:06,506
But once, and only once,
did I hook into the real thing.

915
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:11,241
Happened in Malibu.
Oh, boy, was she something.

916
01:11:11,984 --> 01:11:15,420
We had a great setup.
A shack on the beach. She cooked, I ate.

917
01:11:16,055 --> 01:11:19,422
- What the hell, we dug each other.
- Do you know what a thrill this is?

918
01:11:19,491 --> 01:11:23,086
To waste my last hours here
listening to the plot of your next dirty film?

919
01:11:23,162 --> 01:11:27,292
This was for real, Steve.
And it was fantastic.

920
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,425
But then the guilt started tearing me apart.

921
01:11:30,502 --> 01:11:32,265
- La cuenta.
- Wait a minute.

922
01:11:33,005 --> 01:11:36,805
I went to a shrink five times a week
to hear the same questions.

923
01:11:36,976 --> 01:11:38,841
"Do you love the girl? Sure, I do.

924
01:11:38,911 --> 01:11:41,812
"Do you love your wife and kids?
Of course I love them.

925
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,440
"Would you give them up for the girl?
Hell, no.

926
01:11:44,516 --> 01:11:47,849
"Would you give the girl up for them?
I can't. I love her."

927
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:51,550
$18,000 later, he came to the key question.

928
01:11:52,157 --> 01:11:54,557
"Do you love her enough to give her up?"

929
01:11:55,027 --> 01:11:57,188
That's the one that pinned me to the rack.

930
01:11:57,663 --> 01:12:01,030
One cockamamie question
cost me $18,000.

931
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,728
And that doesn't include the Kleenex
I used up crying.

932
01:12:04,503 --> 01:12:08,906
I didn't go back to the coast for five years.
By that time, she'd had twin boys...

933
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:13,443
...and a kidney-shaped pool, went
to Weight Watchers every Thursday night.

934
01:12:14,813 --> 01:12:18,544
I've got to meet Patty and the boys.
We're going on some fakakta picnic.

935
01:12:18,717 --> 01:12:20,912
That's all I need now, Spanish ants.

936
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:27,521
You two may be two ships that passed
in the night and scraped hulls for a week.

937
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,720
In which case, relax and enjoy.

938
01:12:32,498 --> 01:12:33,260
I see.

939
01:12:33,999 --> 01:12:35,864
Lots of luck, boy-chick.

940
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:46,711
He was right, your fat friend.

941
01:12:47,746 --> 01:12:48,974
He was right.

942
01:12:50,349 --> 01:12:53,580
He loved a girl enough to give her up.
But, my God, $18,000?

943
01:12:53,652 --> 01:12:56,018
I could have told him for a lot less.

944
01:12:56,822 --> 01:12:58,414
I'm not giving you up.

945
01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:00,854
- What?
- I'm not giving you up. Look.

946
01:13:01,393 --> 01:13:04,453
- I know I'm selfish and neurotic.
- And American.

947
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:05,326
American.

948
01:13:05,397 --> 01:13:06,557
- Married.
- Married.

949
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:07,894
- Spoiled.
- Spoiled.

950
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:10,400
Which is precisely
why I'm not giving you up.

951
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:14,428
Why can't we get a little flat in Soho?
We'll see each other whenever we can.

952
01:13:14,506 --> 01:13:17,475
And if you're worried
about breaking up a family, forget it.

953
01:13:17,543 --> 01:13:21,138
There will be no families broken up.
You just have to take my word for it.

954
01:13:21,213 --> 01:13:23,841
I think that Soho makes a lot of sense,
for both of us.

955
01:13:23,916 --> 01:13:27,784
You can walk there.
I can take a taxi, the tube, or the 22 bus.

956
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:30,587
Vickie, what the hell have we got to lose?

957
01:13:34,026 --> 01:13:36,551
And which part of Soho
did you have in mind?

958
01:13:38,964 --> 01:13:41,125
- Do you like Chinese food?
- I love Chinese.

959
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:44,431
The reason I ask is,
there is a street called Macclesfield Street.

960
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:46,698
- Do you know it?
- To know it is to love it.

961
01:13:46,772 --> 01:13:49,366
- You've had a flat there before.
- Many times.

962
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:30,174
- What's the flat number?
- 4D.

963
01:14:33,252 --> 01:14:34,685
They're all named French.

964
01:14:34,753 --> 01:14:37,244
- You think they're related?
- Only in price.

965
01:14:37,489 --> 01:14:38,922
- Only in what?
- Price.

966
01:14:47,699 --> 01:14:49,098
What do you think?

967
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:53,768
- It's not bad.
- No, it isn't, is it? Really.

968
01:14:53,839 --> 01:14:56,171
- It's got distinct possibilities.
- Sure.

969
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:57,364
Oh, God.

970
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:04,505
- Hello.
- Hello.

971
01:16:04,576 --> 01:16:06,703
- You moving into 4D?
- Yes, I am.

972
01:16:07,079 --> 01:16:10,640
- I'm Dora French. I'm in 5D, just above.
- Hello.

973
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:15,578
If you get a bit busy...

974
01:16:15,921 --> 01:16:18,446
Anything you can't handle,
know what I mean?

975
01:16:19,258 --> 01:16:22,489
- I'd be most obliged.
- It would be my pleasure, certainly.

976
01:16:22,628 --> 01:16:23,287
Yes.

977
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:25,490
- Thanks very much.
- Not at all.

978
01:16:25,564 --> 01:16:26,963
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

979
01:16:36,074 --> 01:16:38,634
This is the second day she's forgotten
her lunch box.

980
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:41,770
- Would you like some coffee, dear?
- No, I ate too much.

981
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:44,407
- Coq au vin was perfect.
- Thank you.

982
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:49,079
- I think I'm going to walk it off.
- Take Dilly with you.

983
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:50,916
- Dilly?
- Yeah, take him with you.

984
01:16:50,989 --> 01:16:53,287
You think he should go out in the rain?

985
01:16:53,358 --> 01:16:54,985
It stopped an hour ago.

986
01:16:56,895 --> 01:16:58,453
Yeah. Right.

987
01:16:58,964 --> 01:17:00,693
Dilly, come on.

988
01:17:16,748 --> 01:17:17,737
Taxi!

989
01:17:38,537 --> 01:17:40,232
- Hello.
- Hi.

990
01:17:40,305 --> 01:17:41,294
Hi.

991
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:47,437
- Sorry about this.
- It's all right.

992
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:50,705
- Are we eating?
- That is what we arranged.

993
01:17:51,049 --> 01:17:52,141
Oh, right.

994
01:17:53,552 --> 01:17:56,851
- What are we having?
- Coq au vin. I hope you're hungry.

995
01:17:57,356 --> 01:17:59,153
- I can always eat.
- Good.

996
01:18:01,159 --> 01:18:03,855
- I'll just put Dilly down.
- Take your coat off.

997
01:18:05,497 --> 01:18:09,263
- How did you manage to get away?
- Actually, I'm out walking the dog.

998
01:18:12,804 --> 01:18:14,396
Goodbye, coq au vin.

999
01:18:21,413 --> 01:18:22,641
Your sweater.

1000
01:18:24,082 --> 01:18:25,743
- Oh, God.
- Okay?

1001
01:18:26,284 --> 01:18:28,650
Give me that. Come on.

1002
01:18:32,858 --> 01:18:35,156
Crikey, you got four arms.

1003
01:18:35,227 --> 01:18:38,287
- Thursday.
- Thursday. Go on.

1004
01:18:51,276 --> 01:18:53,471
- Is that you, dear?
- Yeah.

1005
01:18:53,912 --> 01:18:56,380
How did it go?
Was he a good boy or a bad boy?

1006
01:18:59,618 --> 01:19:03,213
You know, he didn't do a thing.
I'm gonna take him for another 20 minutes.

1007
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:04,679
That's silly.

1008
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:07,857
No, if you're gonna train a dog,
you got to train him right.

1009
01:19:07,926 --> 01:19:09,951
Here, Dilly! Come on, Dilly!

1010
01:19:10,595 --> 01:19:12,324
Come on, boy. Come on, Dilly.

1011
01:19:17,402 --> 01:19:18,391
Taxi!

1012
01:19:58,844 --> 01:20:01,711
I've had a job offered me.
I wasn't gonna tell you.

1013
01:20:01,813 --> 01:20:05,374
I wasn't going to take it.
But I know now, it's the only way out.

1014
01:20:05,951 --> 01:20:09,079
- Where?
- A long way away. Johannesburg.

1015
01:20:10,856 --> 01:20:11,845
Eric.

1016
01:20:12,524 --> 01:20:15,755
My brother's out there.
They're opening a new hospital...

1017
01:20:17,963 --> 01:20:21,626
It's a fine opportunity, really.
I'll take Madeleine and the boys.

1018
01:20:22,334 --> 01:20:25,599
It's been torturing me,
the necessity of making a decision.

1019
01:20:25,937 --> 01:20:28,462
I haven't told anybody, not even Madeleine.

1020
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,607
Do you want me to stay?

1021
01:20:31,676 --> 01:20:34,110
- To turn down the offer?
- Don't be foolish, Eric.

1022
01:20:34,579 --> 01:20:35,705
Forgive me?

1023
01:20:36,515 --> 01:20:37,846
Forgive you for what?

1024
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,979
For bringing you so much misery.

1025
01:20:40,318 --> 01:20:42,616
I'll forgive you if you'll forgive me.

1026
01:20:42,687 --> 01:20:44,587
How will it end with us?

1027
01:20:46,157 --> 01:20:49,684
Don't talk about it. I don't know.
It'll end. Everything ends.

1028
01:20:55,033 --> 01:20:56,728
All that was a week ago.

1029
01:20:57,035 --> 01:20:58,297
Socks, please.

1030
01:21:02,007 --> 01:21:06,410
Today was our last day together.
Our very last together in all our lives.

1031
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,271
Dirty enough?

1032
01:21:10,215 --> 01:21:12,911
- It's beautiful.
- At 12:30 this morning.

1033
01:21:14,185 --> 01:21:16,585
Those last few hours went by so quickly.

1034
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:20,652
- Sunday.
- Yeah, Sunday.

1035
01:21:27,666 --> 01:21:28,655
Sunday.

1036
01:21:29,401 --> 01:21:31,301
...I had no thoughts at all.

1037
01:21:32,837 --> 01:21:36,136
Only an overwhelming desire
not to feel anything ever again.

1038
01:21:58,597 --> 01:22:00,258
Safe. The game's over.

1039
01:22:11,943 --> 01:22:13,205
Excuse me.

1040
01:22:14,245 --> 01:22:15,234
Sorry.

1041
01:22:28,493 --> 01:22:29,721
Here you are.

1042
01:22:30,829 --> 01:22:32,057
You're not leaving?

1043
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:34,189
We're taking the kids to lunch
at Kew Gardens.

1044
01:22:34,265 --> 01:22:35,789
- Didn't I tell you?
- No.

1045
01:22:35,867 --> 01:22:39,098
- Christ, I thought I mentioned it. Sorry.
- That's all right.

1046
01:22:39,170 --> 01:22:41,434
- You didn't go to any trouble?
- No.

1047
01:22:41,506 --> 01:22:44,236
- You sure?
- Truly. Do you have time for coffee?

1048
01:22:44,309 --> 01:22:46,675
- I don't even have time for a shower.
- Oh, dear.

1049
01:22:46,745 --> 01:22:50,272
What are you gonna do?
You gonna take the kids to lunch?

1050
01:22:50,348 --> 01:22:52,373
Something like that, yes. Don't worry.

1051
01:22:52,450 --> 01:22:53,439
- Sure?
- Truly.

1052
01:22:53,518 --> 01:22:56,783
- Why do you look worried?
- I'm only worried you'll be late.

1053
01:22:57,355 --> 01:22:58,879
- Have a nice day.
- And you.

1054
01:23:27,719 --> 01:23:30,313
Cecil? It's me. Listen.

1055
01:23:30,388 --> 01:23:33,585
How'd you like to come for lunch,
stay for dinner, play chess...

1056
01:23:33,658 --> 01:23:35,523
...watch TV, and kiss me good night?

1057
01:23:36,461 --> 01:23:40,056
- Sorry, I've already made arrangements.
- Yes, of course you have.

1058
01:23:40,131 --> 01:23:40,859
'Bye.

1059
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:41,921
'Bye.

1060
01:24:28,246 --> 01:24:31,238
The picture is just about set.
I hired this hot, new director.

1061
01:24:31,716 --> 01:24:35,618
Sensational. $12,000.
He's 24 years old, hair down to here.

1062
01:24:35,687 --> 01:24:38,019
He has to use a shoehorn
to get into his pants.

1063
01:24:38,089 --> 01:24:40,489
The guy wears bracelets.
He has heels like that.

1064
01:24:40,558 --> 01:24:43,356
- Walter.
- The guy's last picture was a smash.

1065
01:24:43,461 --> 01:24:45,429
- Kind of a group grope in 3D.
- Walter...

1066
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:49,729
When you see those big boobs coming
out of the screen at you, you better duck.

1067
01:24:50,935 --> 01:24:52,698
- Walter.
- What?

1068
01:24:53,404 --> 01:24:57,170
- You remember that talk we had in Spain?
- Don't tell me that's still going on.

1069
01:24:59,944 --> 01:25:03,436
You told me that you broke up
with the girl because you loved her.

1070
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:05,005
But you didn't tell me how.

1071
01:25:07,252 --> 01:25:08,651
Only one way, pal:

1072
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,855
According to the rules laid down
by the Geneva Convention.

1073
01:25:11,923 --> 01:25:14,289
Kick her right in the teeth.
Lay it on the line.

1074
01:25:14,626 --> 01:25:17,094
Sometimes you got to be cruel to be kind.

1075
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:21,098
- I got it.
- Lunch is on me.

1076
01:25:21,432 --> 01:25:23,627
I hate to see a guy losing them all.

1077
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:28,138
Listen, could you lend me
a couple of pounds?

1078
01:25:28,606 --> 01:25:30,073
Why don't you sign, Walter?

1079
01:25:30,141 --> 01:25:32,632
They won't let me do that in here anymore.

1080
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:33,699
My treat.

1081
01:25:50,662 --> 01:25:54,257
And the solid color
should be out there, okay?

1082
01:25:56,901 --> 01:25:57,697
Hello?

1083
01:25:58,136 --> 01:26:00,036
Hi. Can you make it tonight?

1084
01:26:00,438 --> 01:26:02,998
Tonight? Isn't it your night
for the symphony?

1085
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:06,608
I can get away for a bit.
There's something I want to talk about.

1086
01:26:06,845 --> 01:26:10,076
Can you get a sitter for the kids
and meet me at the flat?

1087
01:26:10,181 --> 01:26:11,148
Okay, fine.

1088
01:26:11,549 --> 01:26:13,312
Good. See you later.

1089
01:26:13,985 --> 01:26:14,974
'Bye.

1090
01:27:11,609 --> 01:27:13,440
- I'm in a hurry.
- All right.

1091
01:27:23,087 --> 01:27:27,421
It's flattering that you'd give up Beethoven
for me, even if it is only for 30 bars.

1092
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:29,183
- Drink?
- No, thanks.

1093
01:27:30,795 --> 01:27:31,955
- Vickie.
- Yes.

1094
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,501
- Why don't you sit down?
- Thank you.

1095
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:44,471
- Vickie.
- Yes, again.

1096
01:27:47,578 --> 01:27:49,478
I think I'll have that drink.

1097
01:27:54,819 --> 01:27:57,652
- You said you had something to say to me.
- I do.

1098
01:27:58,156 --> 01:28:01,523
I do. I have something
that I want to say to you.

1099
01:28:08,132 --> 01:28:10,066
I've been doing some thinking.

1100
01:28:11,069 --> 01:28:14,266
- About us, which is natural.
- Yes.

1101
01:28:20,511 --> 01:28:21,500
It's...

1102
01:28:24,415 --> 01:28:26,781
What I wanted to say was that...

1103
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,017
It's just that...

1104
01:28:33,057 --> 01:28:34,046
That...

1105
01:28:37,428 --> 01:28:40,989
I love you very much, and I can't seem
to get you out of my mind.

1106
01:28:42,934 --> 01:28:45,095
Which is not that important, but...

1107
01:28:46,504 --> 01:28:47,528
Oh, my God.

1108
01:28:50,041 --> 01:28:53,033
You are so ignorant
about what is important.

1109
01:29:17,635 --> 01:29:20,399
- What are you doing?
- Taking your coat off.

1110
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:25,008
- No, wait. We can't. We can't do this.
- I've done it.

1111
01:29:25,076 --> 01:29:28,807
- I've got to be at the Albert Hall.
- You don't have to be at the Albert Hall.

1112
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,713
- They're playing Beethoven.
- Beethoven won't mind.

1113
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:53,833
You've been gone a long time.

1114
01:29:53,905 --> 01:29:56,135
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

1115
01:30:01,179 --> 01:30:03,477
Did you leave the house that way?

1116
01:30:04,348 --> 01:30:07,476
- What way?
- With a golf sock.

1117
01:30:11,756 --> 01:30:14,748
- I must have.
- How could that happen?

1118
01:30:15,793 --> 01:30:19,126
How many times have I told you,
"Keep the kids out of my drawers."

1119
01:30:19,197 --> 01:30:20,357
Okay, Steve.

1120
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:22,895
From now on,
don't rush me when I'm dressing.

1121
01:30:22,967 --> 01:30:24,093
All right.

1122
01:30:45,022 --> 01:30:47,547
The actuarial reports, their sales receipts.

1123
01:30:50,027 --> 01:30:52,154
That's it, Derek, I'm off to lunch.

1124
01:30:52,997 --> 01:30:55,090
It's been a long time between lunches.

1125
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:57,999
Nice of you to keep score, Derek,
but not essential.

1126
01:30:58,069 --> 01:31:01,197
- What do I say if someone calls?
- I told you, I'm out to lunch.

1127
01:31:02,006 --> 01:31:04,440
One of the long ones,
or one of the short ones?

1128
01:31:04,775 --> 01:31:07,403
What if I told you
it was none of your business?

1129
01:31:07,478 --> 01:31:09,378
I'd say it was one of the long ones.

1130
01:31:09,614 --> 01:31:13,106
Like your job here? Just keep talking,
it'll be one of the short ones.

1131
01:31:17,288 --> 01:31:18,277
Hello?

1132
01:31:19,557 --> 01:31:21,525
Just a moment. It's for you.

1133
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:23,984
I told you, I'm not here.

1134
01:31:24,629 --> 01:31:26,256
I think you are, sir.

1135
01:31:29,667 --> 01:31:30,531
Hello?

1136
01:31:30,601 --> 01:31:33,502
It's me, I'm sorry,
I'm not going to be able to make lunch.

1137
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:34,595
What happened?

1138
01:31:35,273 --> 01:31:37,639
What didn't happen? The dyes are wrong...

1139
01:31:38,676 --> 01:31:40,200
Go away!

1140
01:31:40,645 --> 01:31:43,637
They've screwed up all the orders,
the sizes are all wrong.

1141
01:31:43,714 --> 01:31:46,205
I have to get to the warehouse
to sort it all out.

1142
01:31:46,284 --> 01:31:47,979
Can't you put it off until tomorrow?

1143
01:31:48,252 --> 01:31:51,483
I can't. They have to be on the plane
for New York today.

1144
01:31:52,890 --> 01:31:54,448
Can you make dinner?

1145
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:57,451
- I don't think I can.
- I can get a sitter.

1146
01:31:58,829 --> 01:32:00,694
I think we've got something planned.

1147
01:32:01,365 --> 01:32:03,526
Dinner could go all the way to breakfast.

1148
01:32:03,901 --> 01:32:04,993
Breakfast?

1149
01:32:05,870 --> 01:32:07,303
Let me see what I can do.

1150
01:32:07,638 --> 01:32:09,469
God bless you, Mr. Blackburn.

1151
01:32:10,374 --> 01:32:12,433
Now! What was all that...

1152
01:32:18,182 --> 01:32:21,276
Would you run down and get me
one of those Italian sandwiches?

1153
01:32:21,352 --> 01:32:23,616
One of the long ones
or one of the short ones?

1154
01:32:23,688 --> 01:32:25,315
Just get the sandwich, Derek.

1155
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:43,270
Hello?

1156
01:32:43,574 --> 01:32:44,836
Hi, did I catch you?

1157
01:32:45,142 --> 01:32:46,507
I'm going out the door.

1158
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:47,872
- Don't hurry.
- What?

1159
01:32:48,145 --> 01:32:52,047
A call came in, I have to get a prospectus
out to New York and Oslo, immediately.

1160
01:32:53,417 --> 01:32:54,384
My God.

1161
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:58,217
If I work straight through,
I can be there by 11:00, okay?

1162
01:32:58,522 --> 01:33:01,320
Why don't we forget tonight?
If you've got to work, work.

1163
01:33:01,592 --> 01:33:03,457
Don't blow a fuse...

1164
01:33:05,263 --> 01:33:06,594
Hold on just a second.

1165
01:33:06,764 --> 01:33:08,823
Hello? Could you wait a second, please?

1166
01:33:09,467 --> 01:33:11,526
Vickie, don't be ridiculous.

1167
01:33:11,802 --> 01:33:16,466
I'll be there by 11:00, no matter what.
If my work isn't done, I'll finish later.

1168
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:18,269
- Is that okay?
- Perfectly.

1169
01:33:18,342 --> 01:33:19,138
You sure?

1170
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:21,974
Absolutely, I'm sorry I sounded like a twit.

1171
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:23,910
Forget it, see you at 11:00.

1172
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:26,510
- Hello?
- Hello, Steve?

1173
01:33:26,584 --> 01:33:27,608
Hello, Gloria.

1174
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:28,743
Where are you?

1175
01:33:28,986 --> 01:33:31,216
What do you mean? The office.
You called me.

1176
01:33:31,389 --> 01:33:33,516
You're supposed to be home,
getting ready.

1177
01:33:33,691 --> 01:33:35,215
The curtain goes up at 7:30.

1178
01:33:35,293 --> 01:33:37,659
- What curtain?
- Preview of the new Pinter play.

1179
01:33:37,728 --> 01:33:39,696
UNICEF benefit, I'm on the committee.

1180
01:33:40,564 --> 01:33:42,429
My God, I forgot.

1181
01:33:42,566 --> 01:33:46,730
Gloria, I've got to get a report out
to Oslo and New York. It'll take hours.

1182
01:33:47,305 --> 01:33:50,138
Then go back and finish it after the play,
but come home now.

1183
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:52,266
I'm not walking into that theater alone.

1184
01:33:52,610 --> 01:33:54,100
Okay. Okay.

1185
01:33:55,513 --> 01:33:56,980
When does the play finish?

1186
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:57,844
10:30.

1187
01:33:58,215 --> 01:34:01,844
All right, but I'm gonna have to work later,
much later.

1188
01:34:02,119 --> 01:34:04,178
All right, but come home now.

1189
01:34:16,367 --> 01:34:17,595
Oh, Christ.

1190
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:40,579
Oh, no.

1191
01:34:44,595 --> 01:34:45,584
Damn.

1192
01:35:05,883 --> 01:35:06,872
Hello.

1193
01:35:07,251 --> 01:35:09,651
- We met on the stairs.
- Yes. How are you?

1194
01:35:09,754 --> 01:35:13,554
I'm well, thank you. Sorry to bother you
now, but do you have oregano?

1195
01:35:14,158 --> 01:35:16,126
I hope not. I had a checkup last week.

1196
01:35:17,595 --> 01:35:18,584
No.

1197
01:35:19,029 --> 01:35:21,054
Actually, it's an herb.

1198
01:35:21,165 --> 01:35:23,429
I was doing some cooking...

1199
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:25,500
...and I ran out.

1200
01:35:26,637 --> 01:35:29,629
No. I don't have much use for my kitchen,
know what I mean?

1201
01:35:29,707 --> 01:35:30,731
Of course not.

1202
01:35:30,841 --> 01:35:34,333
There's a delicatessen in Dean Street,
just across Shaftesbury Avenue.

1203
01:35:34,412 --> 01:35:37,006
Of course, I'll try there. Thank you.

1204
01:35:43,954 --> 01:35:46,422
Hello. A jar of oregano, please.

1205
01:35:47,358 --> 01:35:48,882
Fourteen pence.

1206
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:51,453
Fourteen pence.
Cheers, thanks very much.

1207
01:36:32,837 --> 01:36:34,168
- Hello!
- Hello.

1208
01:36:36,574 --> 01:36:39,099
- Finish your work?
- No, I've got to get back.

1209
01:36:39,777 --> 01:36:43,679
- It must be an important account.
- Tremendous.

1210
01:36:44,648 --> 01:36:47,879
Forty-five ships, $70 million in insurance.

1211
01:36:48,853 --> 01:36:51,014
- What's that?
- It's chicken chasseur.

1212
01:36:52,690 --> 01:36:55,215
- What's that smell?
- Oregano.

1213
01:36:58,162 --> 01:37:00,790
I ran out of it, earlier this evening.

1214
01:37:01,799 --> 01:37:04,996
I had to go to the delicatessen
to get some more.

1215
01:37:05,302 --> 01:37:07,031
- At this hour?
- At this hour.

1216
01:37:07,171 --> 01:37:10,538
A funny thing happened on the way back
from the delicatessen.

1217
01:37:10,808 --> 01:37:14,505
I bumped into Shaftesbury Avenue
as the theaters were letting out...

1218
01:37:14,578 --> 01:37:16,273
...and how was the play?

1219
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:21,108
- I tried to call you.
- Of course.

1220
01:37:21,185 --> 01:37:24,348
I did. Gloria rang right after you hung up.

1221
01:37:24,688 --> 01:37:27,384
- She's on this committee and...
- A committee.

1222
01:37:28,292 --> 01:37:31,591
I forgot about it, I called you right back
but your line was busy.

1223
01:37:31,795 --> 01:37:35,094
Look, if you want to take your wife
to the theater, please do.

1224
01:37:35,165 --> 01:37:38,896
Just don't give me any of this bullshit
$75 million and 85 billion ships.

1225
01:37:38,969 --> 01:37:42,268
It's no bullshit,
only it was 45 ships and $70 million.

1226
01:37:42,339 --> 01:37:45,740
I am fed up with you!
I am fed up with this arrangement!

1227
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:48,271
I'm fed up hanging around on the chance...

1228
01:37:48,345 --> 01:37:51,041
...you condescend to drop in
between baseball and golf.

1229
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:53,982
And if you do not have to take
your children to Kew Gardens.

1230
01:37:54,051 --> 01:37:56,576
- We did take our...
- Lf you want a whore, step outside...

1231
01:37:56,654 --> 01:37:58,918
...and press any button marked "French."

1232
01:37:58,989 --> 01:38:02,652
You are a thoughtless, callous, selfish...

1233
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:05,695
Do not touch me.

1234
01:38:06,730 --> 01:38:07,697
Do not.

1235
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:12,291
Oh, Christ.

1236
01:38:32,923 --> 01:38:35,084
I'm beginning to sound like a wife.

1237
01:39:47,598 --> 01:39:48,724
Inland Telegraph?

1238
01:39:48,799 --> 01:39:50,790
This is account 1-2-0-8-7.

1239
01:39:51,702 --> 01:39:53,329
Goes to Vickie Allessio.

1240
01:39:53,437 --> 01:39:55,928
A-L-L-E-S-S-l-O.

1241
01:39:56,607 --> 01:39:58,199

1242
01:39:58,742 --> 01:39:59,731
Flat 4.

1243
01:40:01,011 --> 01:40:02,000
Message:

1244
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:06,345
"Darling, our fat friend was right.

1245
01:40:08,619 --> 01:40:10,610
"Only it didn't cost $18,000.

1246
01:40:12,823 --> 01:40:14,313
"It cost a lot more.

1247
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:18,785
"Signed, Steve."

1248
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:21,356
Could you read that back, please?

1249
01:40:26,403 --> 01:40:28,268
That's it. Thank you.

1250
01:41:19,656 --> 01:41:22,648
Inland Telegraph. This is 1-2-0-8-7.

1251
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:26,388
I sent a telegram about 20 minutes ago.
Can you stop it?

1252
01:41:27,431 --> 01:41:28,955
1-2-0-8-7.

1253
01:41:31,034 --> 01:41:34,060
You can?
Cancel it, immediately. Thank you.

1254
01:41:55,225 --> 01:41:57,216
"Steve...

1255
01:41:58,996 --> 01:42:03,365
"Steve, you made me feel 18
for the first time in my life."

1256
01:42:04,635 --> 01:42:06,603
Oh, shit!

1257
01:42:09,873 --> 01:42:11,500
Shit, shit.

1258
01:42:56,153 --> 01:42:59,384
I got some lasagna at the Terrazza.
Come and get it.

1259
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:03,620
Vickie?

1260
01:43:22,479 --> 01:43:23,446
Taxi!

1261
01:44:51,835 --> 01:44:52,665
Taxi!

1262
01:44:57,341 --> 01:44:59,741
- Would you care to share it?
- Are you married?

1263
01:44:59,810 --> 01:45:00,538
Yeah.

1264
01:45:01,178 --> 01:45:02,202
You take it.
