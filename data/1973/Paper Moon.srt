1
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,520
Say, it's only a paper moon

2
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,000
Sailing over a cardboard sea

3
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,480
But it wouldn't be make-believe

4
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,400
If you believed in me

5
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,240
Yes, it's only a canvas sky

6
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,520
Hanging over a cotton tree

7
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,120
But it wouldn't be make-believe

8
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,560
If you believed in me

9
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,000
Without your love

10
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,960
It's a honky-tonk parade

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,360
Without your love

12
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,280
It's a melody played
in a penny arcade

13
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,640
It's a Barnum and Bailey world

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,880
Just as hollow as it can be

15
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,560
But it wouldn't be make-believe

16
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,520
If you believed in me.

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,400
Rock of ages, cleft for me

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,320
Rock of ages, cleft for me

19
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,160
Let me hide myself in thee

20
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,880
Let the water and the blood

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,560
From thy wounded side
which flowed

22
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,160
Be of sin the double cure

23
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,480
Safe from wrath
and make me pure.

24
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,240
"Judge me, oh Lord,

25
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
"for I have lost
in mine integrity.

26
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,080
"I have trusted
also in the Lord,

27
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,200
"therefore I shall not slide.

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,040
"Examine me, oh Lord,
and prove me.

29
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,720
"Try my reins and my heart,

30
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,480
"for Thy loving kindness
is before mine eyes

31
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,560
"and I have walked in Thy truth.

32
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,200
"I have not sat

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,720
"with evil persons.

34
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,320
"Neither will I go in
with dissemblers.

35
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,200
"I will wash mine hands

36
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,600
"in innocency.

37
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,400
"So will I compass
Thine alter, oh Lord,

38
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,240
"that I may publish with
the voice of thanksgiving

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,280
and tell of all Thy
wondrous work..."

40
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
Howdy.

41
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,320
Loggins' funeral.

42
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,280
Yes, ma'am.

43
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,960
You ain't related, are ya'?

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,120
Related, ma'am?

45
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,880
We're looking
for the child's kin.

46
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,560
Thought I saw
some resemblance.

47
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,200
No kin, huh?

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,320
None we know of, 'cept out
in Missouri someplace.

49
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,320
Missouri.

50
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,640
Seems you got
the child's jaw.

51
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,280
No, ma'am, just
a friend of her mama's.

52
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,560
A friend.
Just passing through town.

53
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,560
If ever a child needed a friend.

54
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,440
"...will I bless the Lord.

55
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,680
Amen."

56
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,080
- Amen.
- Amen.

57
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Amen, Essie Maye.

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,640
I just know
your ass is still warm.

59
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,480
Would you like
some water, Addie?

60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,040
We'll get the child some water.

61
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,200
Bless you child.

62
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,640
I just wanted to pay
my respects to your mama.

63
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,560
Well, I'm going
to have to be going.

64
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,160
It's a long way to St. Louis.

65
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,960
St. Louis?
You mean in Missouri?

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes, ma'am.

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,320
I... I sell
the good book, ma'am.

68
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,520
Just moving through the country
with the Lord's good news.

69
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,720
Addie, child, don't you have

70
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,480
your Aunt Billie
living in St. Joseph?

71
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,240
St. Joseph, Missouri.

72
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,840
It's her poor mother's sister.

73
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,080
The child's only known relative.

74
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,120
That so?

75
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,960
You're driving your
chariot to Missouri, sir.

76
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,880
You could deliver this
child to her kin folk.

77
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,880
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it a chariot, Reverend.

78
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,400
I'll write the women
a letter tonight.

79
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,480
Hold it, hold it.

80
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,560
I have to think upon this,
you know, uh...

81
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,080
I mean, I may have to make
a few stops along the way.

82
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,920
I never traveled
with no child before.

83
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,680
But you're going that way.

84
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,920
The child's got no place to go.

85
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,920
Well... the eyes of the Lord.

86
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,400
Expect I have no choice, do I?

87
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,480
Hallelujah.

88
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,800
God works in mysterious ways.

89
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,920
Don't he now?

90
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,920
Come on, Addie.

91
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,200
Better get your things together.

92
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,960
This nice man's going to take
you to your aunt.

93
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,040
How come you're taking me?

94
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,000
Huh?

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,280
How come you're taking me?

96
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,440
Because I'm going that way,
honey.

97
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,160
Although, I do want to make

98
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,440
just one stop
before we leave town.

99
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,480
Got a little business
to take care of.

100
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,120
You know my mama real good?

101
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,040
Oh, pretty good.

102
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,800
You just stay out here
till I come for you.

103
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,120
Don't you say a word
unless I ask you to.

104
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,080
Mr. Robertson?

105
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,040
That's right.

106
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,120
I'd like a minute
of your time.

107
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,080
Not buying today.

108
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh, not selling.

109
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,320
Just want you to meet
somebody, Mr. Robertson.

110
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,280
Only take a second.

111
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,240
So what?

112
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,600
- Tell him your name, honey.
- Addie.

113
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,560
Addie what, honey?

114
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,520
Addie Loggins.

115
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,600
You done real fine.

116
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,960
I'll be out in a minute.

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,560
Ain't she a sweet child?

118
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,440
No, she ain't a sweet child.

119
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, maybe she don't
seem sweet right now.

120
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,200
That's because she's sad, that
is with her mama being dead...

121
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,560
what, with your brother
getting drunk

122
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,080
and driving
into that tree like that.

123
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,000
What are you trying to pull?
Get out of here.

124
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,960
Get out of here!

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,920
All right, I'm going,

126
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,400
but let me tell you
where I'm going to go.

127
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,640
I don't care where
you're going to go.

128
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,760
I'm going to go see
Mr. J.T. Faraday.

129
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,280
Now, you know
who Mr. J.T. Faraday is?

130
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,200
He's one of
the biggest lawyers in Kansas,

131
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,800
and he don't favor
the man with the money.

132
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,080
He favors the man without it.

133
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,000
And you know what's going
to happen to your brother?

134
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,560
There's going to be
a lawsuit against him.

135
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,640
You know what happens then?

136
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,600
Everything's going to be

137
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,200
just tied up in knots,
just sitting there.

138
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,040
That's his banking money,
his house, everything he owns.

139
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,000
lncluding half this plant.

140
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,600
Now, don't think that poor child
ain't entitled, 'cause she is.

141
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,920
I was thinking,

142
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,800
couple a thousand dollars
would be acceptable.

143
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,160
Couple of thou?

144
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,280
I'll give you 200.

145
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,640
$200?

146
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,560
$200.

147
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,360
It's a deal.

148
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,360
There you are.

149
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,560
That'll be, uh, $67.54.

150
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,680
You sure these tires are new?

151
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,600
$67.54.

152
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,800
Now, we'll have you
to St. Jo in no time.

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,840
What time's the next
train to St. Joseph?

154
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,680
St. Joseph?
Let's see here.

155
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,440
That'll be the 4:14.

156
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,120
Change trains in Kansas City,

157
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,760
and that'll put you
into St. Jo at 9:52 AM.

158
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,080
I want one child's price ticket.

159
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,080
That will be $11.45.

160
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,840
I want you to send
this here telegram

161
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,280
to Mrs. Billie Roy Griggs,
Cosmo Road, St. Joseph.

162
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,240
Train arriving 9:52 AM,

163
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,560
and bringing love,
affection and $20 cash.

164
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,960
Oh, make that $25 cash.

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,760
And sign it just Addie Loggins.

166
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,440
Ten words, that will be
85 cents more.

167
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,600
That will be 12 and 30.

168
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,040
12 and 30, huh?

169
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,640
Uh, you better say
in that message there,

170
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,920
love, affection and $20 cash.

171
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,000
Love, affection and $20 cash.

172
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,960
Now, here's your ticket,

173
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,040
and here's $20
for your Aunt Billie.

174
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,600
Well, we got till 4:15.

175
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,800
I don't suppose you can wait
here by yourself, can you?

176
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,240
You hungry?

177
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,920
You want a Nehi
and a Coney lsland?

178
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,200
Ain't you gonna eat it?

179
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,160
I ain't hungry.

180
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,840
Don't you worry
about going on the train.

181
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,960
You're going to like the train.

182
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,920
Don't worry about it.

183
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,880
Before you know it,

184
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,240
you'll be asleep
in your aunt's house,

185
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,360
all your troubles
will be over.

186
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,320
So eat your Coney lsland.

187
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,280
She don't even
know me.

188
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,480
Well, she's going
to know you now.

189
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,440
She ain't gonna want me.

190
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,600
What are you
making trouble for?

191
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,600
She ain't even seen you, yet.

192
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,760
She never even cared
for my mama.

193
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,920
Nobody didn't care
for your mama.

194
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,200
And she was her sister.

195
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,640
Your mama was a fine woman.

196
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,000
Everybody said she weren't.

197
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,560
Well everybody don't
know your mama, do they?

198
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,400
How good you know my mama?

199
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,640
Good enough to know
you can be real proud

200
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,600
of the happiness
she give to people.

201
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,080
Now, eat your Coney lsland.

202
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,480
You meet my mama
in a barroom?

203
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,480
Where would you get
a question like that?

204
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,360
I hear Miss Ollie talking,
the neighbor lady.

205
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,840
Says one of you's my pa.

206
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,960
Well, don't the world
have a wild imagination?

207
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,960
Eat your Coney lsland.

208
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,520
You my pa?

209
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,920
Of course I ain't your pa.

210
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,360
I'll get you some relish.

211
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,840
A Coney lsland ain't
no good without relish.

212
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,920
Look, I know how you feel.

213
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
I lost my ma, too.

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,160
I even lost my pa.

215
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,040
I don't even know
where my sister is.

216
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,880
I wish I could tell
you I'm your pa,

217
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,880
but it just ain't like that.

218
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,680
You met her in a barroom.

219
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,440
Just because a man meets a woman
in a barroom

220
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,920
don't mean he's your pa.

221
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,320
Eat your Coney lsland.

222
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,080
Well, then,
if you ain't my pa,

223
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,640
I want my $200.

224
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,400
What's that?

225
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,760
I want my $200.

226
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,160
I heard you through the door
talking to that man.

227
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,960
It's my money you got,
and I want it.

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,520
Now, you,
you just hold on a second.

229
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,720
I want my money.

230
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,920
You took my $200!

231
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,480
Will you quiet down, you hear?

232
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,520
I want my $200!

233
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,840
Hold on, now, just hold on.

234
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,400
Let me explain something to you.

235
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,600
It ain't as if you was my pa.

236
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,760
That'd be different.

237
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,960
Well, I ain't your pa, so just
get that out of your head.

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,760
I don't care what those
neighbor ladies said.

239
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
I look like that.

240
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,920
You don't look nothing like me.

241
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,080
You don't look any more like me

242
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,400
than, than you do
that Coney lsland.

243
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,560
Eat that damn thing, you hear?

244
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
We got the same jaw.

245
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,880
Lots of people got the same jaw.

246
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,840
It's possible.

247
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,120
No, no, it ain't possible.

248
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,120
Then I want my $200!

249
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
All right!

250
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,600
All right, maybe
we got the same jaw,

251
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,960
but same jaw don't
mean same blood.

252
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,400
I know a woman looks
like a bullfrog,

253
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,360
but that don't mean she's
the damn thing's mother.

254
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,560
You met my mom in a barroom.

255
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,720
For God's sakes, child.

256
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,680
You think everybody
gets met in a barroom

257
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,800
gets a baby?

258
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,040
It's possible.

259
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,520
Anything is possible,

260
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,720
but possible don't make it true.

261
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,880
Then I want my money!

262
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,240
Will you quiet down?

263
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,280
You know what the
trouble is with you?

264
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,560
You got no appreciation.

265
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,840
All right.

266
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,760
Maybe I did get a little
money from that man,

267
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,240
and you're entitled to that,
but I'm entitled to my share

268
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,480
for getting it
for you, ain't I?

269
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,200
And where do you think
you'd be without me?

270
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,480
You think them folks would spend
a penny to send you east?

271
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,680
No, sir.

272
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,280
But who got you a ticket
to St. Jo?

273
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
Who got you a Nehi
and a Coney lsland?

274
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,760
And threw in $20 extra,

275
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,920
not to mention 85 cents
for that telegram.

276
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,280
You wouldn't have had
any of that without me.

277
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,800
Now, I didn't have to take you,

278
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,160
but I took you, didn't I?

279
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,080
All right, I think
that's fair enough.

280
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,680
We're both a little better off.

281
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,680
You get to St. Jo,

282
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,320
I get myself a
little better car.

283
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,200
Fair is fair.

284
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,280
Now, drink your Nehi,

285
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,400
and eat your Coney lsland.

286
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,400
I want my $200.

287
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,680
I don't have
your $200 no more,

288
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,440
and you know it.

289
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,080
If you don't give me my $200,

290
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,640
I'm going to tell a policeman
how you got it,

291
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,440
and he'll make you
give it to me,

292
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,880
'cause it's mine.

293
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,880
But I don't have it.

294
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,840
Then get it.

295
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,200
How we doing, Angel Pie?

296
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,800
We going to have
a little dessert

297
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,240
when we finish up
our hot dog?

298
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,920
I don't know.

299
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,160
What do you say, Daddy?

300
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,440
Why don't we get Precious
a little dessert

301
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,480
if she eats her dog?

302
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,880
Her name ain't Precious.

303
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,200
I want my money back
on this here ticket,

304
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,600
and I want you to send
this here telegram.

305
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,840
Trip delayed, but
I'm coming real soon!

306
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,080
You just lie down in
the seat and be quiet.

307
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,600
Folks don't take to children
when they're doing business.

308
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,680
Yes?

309
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,680
Good afternoon, ma'am.

310
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,360
Is Mr. Rudolf Morgan
at home, please?

311
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,440
Mr. Morgan?

312
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,600
Yes, ma'am.

313
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,040
My name is Pray, Moses Pray...

314
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,160
Kansas Bible Company.

315
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,280
He'll know.

316
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,640
Oh, I'm sorry.

317
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,320
Mr. Morgan has passed on.

318
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,480
Oh, ma'am, I'm...

319
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,760
I just...

320
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,760
I don't know what to say.

321
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,360
Uh, what was it you
were seeing him about?

322
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,960
Well, he ordered
this here bible from...

323
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,920
Bible?

324
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,040
Rudolph ordered a bible?

325
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,760
Yeah, he ordered this
here deluxe edition

326
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,040
with the lady's
name in the corner.

327
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,000
Lady's name?

328
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,080
Oh, I expect

329
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,760
some special gift
for a family friend.

330
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,960
But under the circumstances,

331
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,960
I'll just give you back

332
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,080
Mr. Morgan's dollar deposit,

333
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,840
and there won't be
no further obligation.

334
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,760
Ma'am, I just don't know
how to put into words

335
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,120
the sense of sorrow
that I feel.

336
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,080
What-what,

337
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,840
what name is in the corner?

338
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,160
I don't really know what name

339
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,440
Mr. Morgan had put

340
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,680
in the corner, ma'am.

341
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Let's see, now.

342
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,680
It's here somewhere.

343
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,680
I've got it.

344
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,760
Uh... here it is.

345
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,760
Pearl.

346
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,920
Pearl.

347
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,080
I'm Pearl.

348
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,400
Well, he must have got

349
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,440
this here good book
for you, ma'am.

350
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,200
Yes. Yes, he bought it for me.

351
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,920
Of course, now, you're
not obliged to take it.

352
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,080
Of course I'll take it.

353
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,280
There's just one thing.

354
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,240
You see, I told him that I
could sell him a cheaper bible,

355
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,840
but no, naturally
he wanted the best...

356
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,760
the best, of course,
being the deluxe edition

357
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,960
with the lady's name printed

358
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,520
in child-in-the-manger
gold letters.

359
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,960
Oh, he would.

360
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,840
Bringing a balance due
of, uh, $8.00? $8.00.

361
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,480
$8.00?

362
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,000
Well, that's, uh, $8.00
minus the dollar deposit,

363
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,640
making it $7.00.

364
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,520
Um, I'll go get my purse.

365
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,200
Well, you're not
obliged to take it, now.

366
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,800
Of course I'm obliged.

367
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,080
He ordered the deluxe.

368
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,840
But cold or no cold,

369
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,600
it's good to be back
in old Manhattan.

370
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,880
Well, tell me, Jack,

371
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,480
you've been in town now
since Thursday.

372
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,120
What have you been doing
with yourself?

373
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,360
Oh, I've had a lot of fun, Don.

374
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,360
I saw some shows, went
to a couple of nightclubs,

375
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,800
and last night, I was invited

376
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,040
over to Fred Allen's
apartment for dinner.

377
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,320
Oh, Fred Allen, eh?

378
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,320
Yeah, he and I are
pretty good friends now.

379
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,480
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

380
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,880
Has Fred got a nice apartment?

381
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,200
Oh, how could I tell, Don,

382
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,720
with all that laundry
hanging in the living room?

383
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,320
Ain't you gonna go to sleep?

384
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,800
Don't you want to hear
Jack Benny?

385
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,720
No.

386
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,360
I don't want to sound catty...

387
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,800
You're too young to smoke.

388
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,280
You're going to set this
whole place on fire.

389
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:29,320
I now owe you $103.72.

390
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,040
Seventy-four.

391
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:38,040
I always knew
someday I'd accompany you

392
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,040
Along Flirtation Walk

393
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,760
A dream foretold

394
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,280
A story
that you would unfold

395
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,320
That lives forever
and never grows old

396
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,440
I always felt

397
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,360
That your little heart
would melt

398
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,680
Along Flirtation Walk...

399
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,560
Frank D. Roosevelt said
we're all feeling a lot better.

400
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,640
He did, did he?

401
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,520
Made me feel good
when he said that.

402
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,360
Better than I've felt
in a long time.

403
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,520
Bet old Frank sure
does wish he was 21.

404
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,760
You don't like me, do you?

405
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,600
No, I don't like you.

406
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,520
Yes?

407
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,920
Afternoon, ma'am.
I was wondering

408
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,160
if Mr. Bates might be at home.

409
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,480
Mr. Bates is dead.

410
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,320
He died over a week ago.

411
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,760
Oh, you mean he passed over,
ma'am?

412
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,000
Why, I was just talking to him

413
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,080
not less than a month ago.

414
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,480
What was it you wanted?

415
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,240
Well, my name is Pray,
Kansas Bible Company.

416
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,560
I'm just here
to deliver this bible

417
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,520
that Mr. Bates ordered.

418
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,480
Bible?

419
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,600
Who is it?
What's the trouble?

420
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,880
Something about Benjamin

421
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,840
buying a bible.

422
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,440
Bible? What kind of Bible?

423
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,280
He said he talked
to Benjamin,

424
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,720
less than a month ago.

425
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,360
Well, I'm-I'm not exactly sure
of the dates, ma'am.

426
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,520
Well, I don't see how.

427
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,720
Benjamin didn't go nowheres
near that shop

428
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,720
for more than a month
before he died.

429
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,400
Well, I may be a little
mixed up on the dates.

430
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,960
What company you say
you're from?

431
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,760
The Kansas Bible Company,
out of Wichita.

432
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,200
Kansas Bible Company?

433
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,360
I ain't never heard of
no Kansas Bible Company.

434
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,640
Daddy...

435
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,640
Can't we go now?

436
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,400
I want to get to church
and pray for Mama.

437
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,640
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sure we can, honey.

438
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,200
Daddy was just fixin' to leave.

439
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,560
This here is my little girl.

440
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,880
It's just the two of us now.

441
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,200
My Mama's gone to the Lord.

442
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,760
Oh, so has poor Mr. Bates,
honey.

443
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,760
I'll just, uh,

444
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,960
give you back
his dollar deposit,

445
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,000
and you let us know if
there's anything we can do.

446
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,960
Hold on, there.

447
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,600
Wait one damn minute.

448
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,320
He actually done
ordered a bible, huh?

449
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,480
Uh, he sure did... here it is,

450
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,360
right here in gold
for somebody named "Marie."

451
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,880
That's her. She's Marie.

452
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,200
Oh, she sure did
mean a lot to him.

453
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,680
He especially had me get
the deluxe edition.

454
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,640
How much to keep this here book?

455
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,720
Oh, w-well,
that one is the...

456
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,000
It's the $12 one, Daddy.

457
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,960
- $12?
- $12?

458
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,080
Uh, yeah, well, honey,
w-we have

459
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,480
to have a little goodness
in our hearts,

460
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,800
I mean, considering
the circumstances.

461
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,840
Never mind the circumstances.

462
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,000
And if it'll make
that woman happy...

463
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,240
I'll take it.

464
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,320
You owe me $85.74.

465
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,840
I mean, we're going
to Washington on the QT.

466
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,920
Molly, she says
we can't go on the QT...

467
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,800
we're got to take
the Pennsylvania.

468
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,000
Hey, I'd better get going.

469
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,920
Hey, Molly, where's my suitcase?
Do you know?

470
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,280
Uh, I'm sure I don't know,
McGee.

471
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,640
You had it last night.

472
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,200
Oh, I know where it is.
It's right here in the hall...

473
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,800
He's going to open the closet!

474
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,120
Now he's going to say

475
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,600
how he's got to straighten
the closet out!

476
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,320
Got to straighten out that
closet one of these days.

477
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,720
How'd you like to do a little
business with me?

478
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,280
You mean instead
of paying me back?

479
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,640
Now, don't get nervous.
I'll pay you back.

480
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,960
I'm just saying,
while we're heading east,

481
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,960
how'd you like to do a little
business together, that's all.

482
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,600
Well, you're looking at me

483
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,120
like I'm out to cheat you
or something.

484
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,720
I am offering you
a business proposition.

485
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,480
Take it or leave it,
and turn off that radio!

486
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,400
You're like to drive us all deaf
with that radio.

487
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Maybe I'll be a big shot...

488
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,920
in an average way, of course.

489
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,560
Okay, I want you
to remember one thing:

490
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,080
I decide on the price.

491
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,280
Maybe you don't know French,

492
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,880
but there's something in this
world called "fine-esse."

493
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,480
$12! I never sold
no bible for $12.

494
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,720
That man was a law officer.

495
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,320
You could've had me
put me in jail.

496
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,160
We got it, didn't we?

497
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,680
I don't care if we got it.

498
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,560
Don't you go making
the decisions.

499
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,760
I make the decisions.

500
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,680
All you got to do is look
like a pretty little girl.

501
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,040
You ain't got something
like a ribbon

502
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,400
in that cigar box, do you?

503
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,720
I got my mom's kimono
in my suitcase,

504
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,240
Chinamen with umbrellas.

505
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,680
That ain't quite
what I had in mind.

506
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,040
You look real nice
in that ribbon.

507
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,720
First off, I didn't know
was she a boy or a girl?

508
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,120
I'm a girl.

509
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,520
Well, it makes
all the difference.

510
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,600
Ain't she got a sweet
little face, somehow.

511
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,400
Well, seeing how I
just got paid today,

512
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,760
we'll take a
ribbon in each color.

513
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,200
How much that going
to set me back?

514
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,680
Well, that'll be 15 cents.

515
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,280
Bought my grandchildren
ribbons just like this

516
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,440
last holiday time.

517
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,120
Grandchildren?
I don't believe it.

518
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,120
You break a five?

519
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,240
Well, you can
believe it, all right.

520
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,480
I'm just as old as I look.

521
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,560
Well, now, here you be...

522
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,600
that's one, two,
three, four, five.

523
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,160
You know, this
old wallet of mine

524
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,440
is about to bust its sides.

525
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,840
I'll give you five ones back,

526
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,000
you give me that $5 bill.

527
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,160
How many grandchildren
you got all together?

528
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,880
Well, I got two little
granddaughters...

529
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,360
a nine year old,
a ten year old...

530
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,280
two grandsons near 16,

531
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,320
and I got a grandson
35 years old.

532
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,800
Come on, you're
pulling my leg.

533
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,400
Why don't you just
give me a $10 bill?

534
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,280
Here's the $5, and
five ones, there.

535
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,880
That way I won't be so quick
to see it break apart.

536
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,440
Six children, huh?
My, my, my...

537
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,680
I've got a daughter, 51.

538
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,640
Oh, now, I don't mean

539
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,760
to be handing you no line,

540
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,360
but that's just pretty
hard to believe

541
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,680
you got a 51-year-old child.

542
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,160
You can believe it,
all right.

543
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,640
Well, I'm afraid I'd have
to see it to believe it.

544
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,080
Much obliged.

545
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,040
See you again.

546
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,520
Y'all come back!

547
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:41,000
That just don't seem
quite right... somehow.

548
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,280
Yes?

549
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,480
I'm looking for Mr. Stanley,
ma'am.

550
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,800
Mr. Stanley's dead.

551
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,960
Oh, well, I'm looking

552
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,840
for Mr. Warren
M. Stanley, ma'am.

553
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,120
Warren's passed on, sir.

554
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,560
Oh, that's hard to believe.

555
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,760
I was just talking to Warren
not more than two weeks back.

556
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,680
He ordered this here bible
from me.

557
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,240
Warren spent money
on a bible?

558
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,040
Yes, ma'am, with the name Elvira
in the corner.

559
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,400
Why would Warren
spend money on a bible?

560
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,960
He took fast to the idea, ma'am.

561
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,120
Only thing is,

562
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,720
he left a balance due of,
well, let's see,

563
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,280
not counting the dollar
deposit...

564
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,840
Daddy, this one's
already paid for.

565
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,240
Huh?

566
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,400
Mr. Stanley paid
for the whole thing,

567
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,520
don't you remember?

568
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,440
Afternoon, ma'am.

569
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,640
Mr. Huff at home?

570
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,600
Mr. Huff passed away,
young man, a week ago.

571
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,880
Oh, gee, I'm sorry.

572
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,480
I was just talking to Mr. Huff
not more than a month ago.

573
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,560
What was it you wanted?

574
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,760
Oh, well, my name is Pray,
Kansas Bible Company.

575
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,040
Mr. Huff ordered this bible

576
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,520
as a gift for someone
named Edna.

577
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,880
Oh, that's my name.

578
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,320
You don't have to take it
if you don't want to.

579
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,560
I'll just give you back

580
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,200
Amos's dollar deposit, and...

581
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,040
Of course I want to keep it.

582
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,200
He bought me a bible.

583
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,160
Yes, ma'am.

584
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,360
Now, I told Amos
I could sell him a cheaper one,

585
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,440
but no, naturally,

586
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,000
he wanted the best...

587
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,680
the best, of course,
being the deluxe edition

588
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,680
with the name printed

589
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,080
in child-in-the-manger
gold letters,

590
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,400
bringing up a balance due of...

591
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,600
Of $24!

592
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,560
$24. I'll get my purse.

593
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
What's your name, honey?

594
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,120
Addie.

595
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,800
Addie. What a sweet little name.

596
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,800
Addie Pray, ma'am.

597
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,160
Well, Addie Pray, I'm
going to give you $24,

598
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,440
and an extra $5 for
just coming to my door.

599
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,920
Praise the Lord.

600
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,360
Praise the Lord.

601
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,920
Keep your sunny side
up, up

602
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,720
Hide the side
that gets blue...

603
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,800
Moze, let's give him
some money.

604
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,920
No.

605
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,720
Just a little bit.

606
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,360
We got $305.16.

607
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,240
Whole 'nother business
giving it away.

608
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,080
It's bad enough
you give away bibles.

609
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,160
But they're poorly.

610
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,240
The whole country's
poorly...

611
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
I told you before.

612
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
But Frank D. Roosevelt says

613
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,640
we got to look out
for one another.

614
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,080
I don't care about
Frank D. Roosevelt.

615
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,120
- But he says it.
- That so?

616
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,480
Why don't you ask
Frank D. Roosevelt

617
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,200
what he thinks about taking
care of himself.

618
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,720
You think he don't eat off
silver trays?

619
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,520
He could eat off tabletops
like the rest of us,

620
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,640
but he don't... you know why?

621
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,160
Because that would make him
look common.

622
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,320
And besides, Frank D. Roosevelt

623
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,320
ain't running this thing.

624
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm running it, so don't
you make up no rules

625
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,480
about what we're
going to give away.

626
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,600
It's my money too,
you know.

627
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,440
$200 belongs to me,
and don't you forget that.

628
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,400
You want it?

629
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,880
Well, just put my share
in my pocket,

630
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,440
and I'll take you
to a train station...

631
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,680
how do you like that?

632
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,840
Get the map.

633
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,160
Find out where the
nearest depot is.

634
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,400
Nothing but trouble, anyway.

635
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,680
First you charge too much,
then you want to give it away.

636
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Where are we now?

637
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,720
We just left Plainville.

638
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,320
$12 for a bible,
then it's up to $24.

639
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,320
If I stay with you,

640
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,880
I'll spend the rest
of my life in jail.

641
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,960
There's a depot in Lincoln.

642
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,040
You can take me to Lincoln.

643
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,080
You bet I will.

644
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,040
Where's Lincoln?

645
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,040
Clear over there.

646
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,520
Oh, boy, you think
I'm going to take you

647
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,320
clear over there just to get you
to some depot?

648
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,280
Then keep going east.

649
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,520
We'll hit one in Sylvan Grove.

650
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,880
- Where's Sylvan Grove?
- Right here.

651
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,440
Well, that'll take us
down through Lucas.

652
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,520
We got to go through something
to get to Sylvan Grove.

653
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,480
I am not complaining.

654
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,240
I'm just saying that'll take you
through Lucas.

655
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,600
You got to go
through Paradox and Waldo

656
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,720
- and Lorraine and Lucas
- Lorraine, huh?

657
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,960
if you want to get
to Sylvan Grove.

658
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,280
Those are pretty
good towns in there.

659
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,520
We could do some
business in there.

660
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,520
Well, it won't matter much.

661
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,640
We're near out
of bibles anyway.

662
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,840
What do you mean,
we're out of bibles?

663
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,200
Why didn't you tell me
we're out of bibles?

664
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,280
You look in the box too,
don't you?

665
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,600
Well, you've got an
excuse for everything.

666
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
'Cause you blame me
for everything.

667
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,760
If we were running
out of bibles,

668
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,720
you should have told me

669
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,840
we were running
out of bibles.

670
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,960
We're running out
of bibles!

671
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,320
Well, then we got
to get new ones!

672
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,280
Then let's get new ones!

673
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,840
We can pick some
up in Great Bend.

674
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,920
Great Bend's the other way.

675
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,520
Well, we got to have
bibles, don't we?

676
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,760
Let's see, now, we
can veer down to Lucas,

677
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,600
and we'll veer
over to Wilson.

678
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,560
Veer off to Lorraine
and Bushton.

679
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,760
And we could veer off
to Hoisington.

680
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,520
We'll just have to keep
on veering, that's all.

681
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,080
I'm getting hungry.

682
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,240
You getting hungry?

683
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,440
Uh-huh.

684
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,240
Just one more chance

685
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,800
To prove
it's you alone I care for

686
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,120
Each night I say
a little prayer for...

687
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,360
You sweet thing.

688
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,040
Don't you tell me that.
Ooh!

689
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,120
Sometimes I just don't know,
with all the old doodly-doo.

690
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,480
Doodly-doo, doodly-doo.

691
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,560
Okay, now, you go on back, now.

692
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,040
I'll see you another time.

693
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,120
Don't send me back.

694
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,560
Oh, you got to go on back.

695
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,000
I'll see you another time,

696
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,480
- I promise.
- I want to go in your place.

697
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,600
No, no.

698
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,080
You trying to keep
secrets from me?

699
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,360
You got diamonds and
rubies in there?

700
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,080
Go on, go on.

701
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,320
Oh, Fido...

702
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,600
Night-night, old Fido.

703
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,440
- Woof-woof.
- Woof-woof.

704
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,640
Woof-woof.

705
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,200
...Still
I'm holding on awhile

706
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,400
You'll give me
just one more word...

707
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,640
There it is.

708
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,080
Much obliged.

709
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,480
Thank you, sir.

710
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
All right, boy, you're next.

711
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,800
I ain't a boy.

712
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,760
Aw, don't let it bother you.

713
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,720
It ain't funny.

714
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,640
No reason to get that sore.

715
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,560
He called me a boy, didn't he?

716
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,320
He just got mixed up,
that's all.

717
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,680
He did not; he looked me
straight in the eye.

718
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,200
Yeah, well, I'm looking you
straight in the eye,

719
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,720
and I think
you're beautiful.

720
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,800
Oh, you're just saying that.

721
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,800
Would I made that up?

722
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,280
Why you're as beautiful
as your mama,

723
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,240
and she put all the flowers
in the world to shame.

724
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,320
You know, they wouldn't
even let her come to Holland

725
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,560
for fear
she'd droop the tulips,

726
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,320
and you got all the good looks
she ever had.

727
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,280
Then how come that
man called me a boy?

728
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,640
I don't know; maybe it's...

729
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,920
Maybe it's 'cause of what
you got on, or something.

730
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,640
What's wrong with what I got on?

731
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,120
Oh, nothing wrong with it.

732
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,560
Just... don't exactly
make you look feminine.

733
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,080
Maybe it wouldn't be
a bad idea

734
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,720
we get you fixed up
a little bit...

735
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,280
get you a new dress,
a fancy new hat, or something.

736
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,360
Come to think of it,

737
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,160
it wouldn't exactly
hurt business, either.

738
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,200
You really think I'm
as pretty as my mama?

739
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,600
Of course I do.

740
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,520
How much money
we got in the box?

741
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,480
$405.16.

742
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,440
Give me a $20.

743
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,440
What for?

744
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,920
Give me a $20.

745
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,200
Come on.

746
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,440
Where are we going?

747
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,200
We're going to get us
some fancy new outfits

748
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,120
with this money you got
from your Aunt Helen.

749
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,440
I don't have no Aunt Helen.

750
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,600
Oh, sure you do, honey.

751
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,400
Come on, let me
explain it to you.

752
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,040
Yes, sir?

753
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,200
I-I'd like

754
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,320
an lpana toothpaste,
and a pack of Sen-Sen.

755
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,480
Uh, 20 and five.

756
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,600
Twenty-five.

757
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,560
Yes, sir.

758
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,680
Here you go.

759
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,000
75 makes one,

760
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,280
four makes five,
and 15 makes 20.

761
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
Thank you very much.

762
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,880
I don't need a bag.

763
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,880
Thank you very much.

764
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,400
Thank you; bye, now.

765
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,880
How much is this?

766
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,480
That'll be 35 cents.

767
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,760
65 cents makes a dollar.

768
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,880
Thank you very much.

769
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,000
Thank you.

770
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,280
Yes?

771
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,960
May I have a bottle
of purple toilet water, please?

772
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,320
That'll be 25 cents.

773
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,120
There you go.

774
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,560
Lady, you made a mistake.

775
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,640
Huh? I give you $4.75.

776
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,560
But I gave you a $20 bill.

777
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,480
Uh-uh. You give me a $5.

778
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,680
No, ma'am, it was a $20 bill.

779
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,040
You give me a $5,
and I give you $4.75.

780
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,920
It was a $20 bill.

781
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,240
Got no $20s in with no $5s.

782
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,240
What's all the turmoil?

783
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,200
What's going on here?

784
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,720
This little girl
give me a $5 bill,

785
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,720
and I give her change.

786
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,840
I gave her

787
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,040
a $20 bill... I know I did.

788
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,640
It was a birthday present
from my Aunt Helen in Wichita,

789
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,160
and she wrote "Happy Birthday,
Addie" on the end of it.

790
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
You just go look and see.

791
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,960
That's it right there!

792
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,760
That's my $20 bill I got from
my Aunt Helen in Wichita.

793
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,080
Give the child her $20 bill.

794
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,280
I'm giving it.

795
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,240
Give the child her $20 bill,
Miss Brownwell.

796
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,440
Yes, sir.

797
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,440
And give her a piece of candy,
Miss Brownwell.

798
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,760
Yes, sir.

799
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,680
And pay attention to things,
Miss Brownwell.

800
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,640
Yes, sir.

801
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,600
Come on in, get
your cotton candy.

802
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,040
Sweetheart, Cotton Candy.

803
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,560
Five cents.

804
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,080
Do you have change
for this five?

805
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,440
There you are, little girl.

806
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,640
Cotton candy,
get your cotton candy.

807
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,320
Mister, this purse
is sure full.

808
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,200
If you give me the five back,
I'll give you five ones.

809
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,920
Cotton candy, get your
cotton candy right here.

810
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,600
Mister, if you got
a ten dollar bill

811
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,240
I'll give you the five back
with the five ones you have.

812
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,000
Would you give me
a ten dollar bill?

813
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,040
There, now don't bother me
any more, you understand?

814
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,800
Cotton candy!

815
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,480
Step up and get
your cotton candy.

816
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,240
Come and get it.

817
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,560
Get your tickets.

818
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,240
Only one fourth of a dollar.

819
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,280
The show goes on
in five minutes.

820
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,200
Six unusual little ladies

821
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,840
unveiling the secrets
of passion.

822
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,640
Found only a few years back

823
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,640
in the actually Egyptian
tomb of Queen Nefereti.

824
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,640
And featuring the luscious
Miss Trixie Delight.

825
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,040
I had my photo took, Moze.

826
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,440
You did, huh?
Ain't that fine.

827
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,160
Moze, can you come have
your photo took with me?

828
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,480
Can't right now, sweetheart.

829
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,440
Only take a minute.

830
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,520
Not now, you hear me?

831
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,840
But it's almost
down here tonight.

832
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,840
It wouldn't be here after...

833
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,800
I can't help that.

834
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,800
Now excuse me, you understand?

835
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,000
How many times
you going to see it?

836
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,600
As many times as I like,
that's how many times.

837
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,720
You seen it half a dozen times.

838
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,000
And I might see it
a half dozen more.

839
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,640
Now why don't you go
play bingo or something?

840
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,760
I don't want to play bingo.

841
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,720
Well, then why don't you go

842
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,200
write another love note
to St. Roosevelt?

843
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Maybe I will.

844
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,920
And stop standing around
here checking on me.

845
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,920
You don't have to worry.

846
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,440
I ain't about to leave
some poor little child

847
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,600
stranded in the middle
of nowhere.

848
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
I got scruples, too,
you know.

849
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,800
You know what that is,
"scruples"?

850
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,000
No, I don't know what it is,

851
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,840
but if you got them, I sure bet
they belong to somebody else.

852
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,480
And his name ain't Frank,
it's Franklin.

853
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,800
Hey there,
my little turtle-dee.

854
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,160
I wondered where you got to.

855
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,120
Where's your pa?

856
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,200
Is my picture ready?

857
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,160
Sure, it's...

858
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,320
Excuse me, folks,
come right back.

859
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,120
Sit back in the moon there,
I'll be right with you.

860
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,120
Let's see.

861
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,640
Here it is, here.

862
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,840
Hey, now, I thought you were

863
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,800
going to sit in the moon
with your pa.

864
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,200
He ain't my pa.

865
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,600
Hi, folks.

866
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,600
Get ready.

867
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,960
Smile. Hold it.

868
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,280
Hold it.

869
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,080
Beautiful.

870
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,480
I-I don't want you smoking
in the car tomorrow.

871
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,920
What?

872
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,200
I didn't say nothing.

873
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,880
I'm just listening to you.

874
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,880
Well, there are going to be

875
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,200
a couple extra people
riding with us,

876
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,120
and this particular person
don't like cigarette smoke.

877
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,600
What extra person?
What?

878
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,280
I said what extra person?

879
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,280
A lady and her maid.

880
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,560
I'm giving them a ride
to Topeka.

881
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,000
I didn't know we was
going to Topeka.

882
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,560
Well, that's because you
don't know everything.

883
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,280
What's the lady's name?

884
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,600
Miss Delight.

885
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,080
Miss Trixie Delight.

886
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,480
She's a real lady.

887
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
She comes from a good family

888
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,040
and I'm just giving her
a ride, that's all.

889
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Well, that's what you're always
talking about, ain't it?

890
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,080
Helping other people out.

891
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,680
Now don't you drop
nothing, lmogene.

892
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,480
You take care of those
breakables, understand?

893
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,920
Yes, Miss Trixie.

894
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,080
Morning.

895
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,160
Car is right over here.

896
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,960
You better ride in
the backseat a while.

897
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,120
And then I danced
in Tuscaloosa.

898
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,240
And the mayor was there,

899
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,320
and he just said the nicest
things about me.

900
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,080
The newspaper ran
a whole big photo on me.

901
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,080
I got a scrap book
telling stories on me

902
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,920
from towns all over.

903
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,320
Tell him 'bout the time that man

904
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,920
tried to crack your head open
with the bottle, Miss Trixie.

905
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,920
Why, lmogene,
you silly old thing.

906
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,400
You know that's not true.

907
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,520
That old country boy

908
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,600
wasn't going to hit me over
the head with no bottle.

909
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,760
He was just horsing around.

910
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,480
Ask me real nice, maybe I'll
tell you about that sometime.

911
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,880
Well, tell him about the time

912
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,000
you almost got thrown
in jail, Miss Trixie.

913
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,520
I just don't
understand it, Daddy,

914
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,960
but this little baby has to go
winky-tinky all the time.

915
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,120
Well, don't you worry none.

916
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,040
We'll just plan on
stopping here for dinner.

917
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,320
But we just stopped for her
to winky-tink at lunch.

918
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,680
That's right, and now we're
stopping for dinner.

919
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,920
Come on.

920
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,480
I ain't hungry.

921
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,280
Want one?

922
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,720
Okay.

923
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,160
How old are you?

924
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,760
I don't know, 15, why?

925
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,440
Just asking, that's all.

926
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,400
Where are you from?

927
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,360
Nowhere.

928
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,000
Well, you got to be
from somewhere.

929
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
Down by Troy, I guess.

930
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,480
How long
have you worked for her?

931
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,320
Ain't kept count.

932
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,920
A year, maybe.

933
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,120
How old you be?

934
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,560
Nine.

935
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,680
She really do all that dancing?

936
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,960
Well, if you want
to call it dancing.

937
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,720
All she do is wag her hips

938
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,000
and shake her
old behind a little.

939
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,440
How come she'd leave
that job back there?

940
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,480
'Cause the boss man
tried to make her

941
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,880
put out for his friends.

942
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,280
And she don't believe
in putting out for free.

943
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,440
She put out much?

944
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,000
Just like a gum machine.

945
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,440
You drop something in and
she'll put something out.

946
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,880
How much she charge?

947
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,640
Most she can get.

948
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,400
But she always
asks for $5.00.

949
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,080
She ain't putting out
for your pa, though.

950
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,440
Says she's going to wait
and get all she can

951
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,920
before she put out for him.

952
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,760
He tell her he was my pa?

953
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,600
Well, not exactly.

954
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,720
I heard him mumbling
something

955
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,200
like he didn't want
to talk about it.

956
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,400
Ain't he?

957
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,800
I'm with him, ain't I?

958
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,440
And how do you come
to be with her?

959
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,200
'Cause she promised to give
me $4.00 every week.

960
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,760
She ain't gave me nothing.

961
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,000
'Cept a nickel or dime,
sometimes.

962
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,000
Why don't you quit?

963
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,960
Quit?

964
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,480
How am I going to quit?

965
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,200
And what if I do quit?

966
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,520
Ain't got no money
to get home to Mom.

967
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,080
And what if I do get home?

968
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,920
They got hard times
as it is.

969
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,800
My mama say, "You go work
for a white lady,

970
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,600
she'll take
good care of you."

971
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,120
You want to know
what I think?

972
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,400
Yeah.

973
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,560
You know the little white speck
on top chicken doo-doo?

974
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,800
Yeah.

975
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,680
Well, that's the kind of white
I think miss Trixie is.

976
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,600
She's just like
that little white speck

977
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,680
on top of old chicken shit.

978
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,840
Oh, I just love it,
love it, love it.

979
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,920
All this white.

980
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,920
It is absolutely
the proper thing

981
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,520
for my particular kind
of appearance.

982
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,760
You know, it wouldn't be bad

983
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,200
for you to have
a new dress, too.

984
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,960
The right kind of dress makes
all the difference in the face.

985
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,960
Especially since you got the
right kind of bone structure.

986
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,400
Oh...

987
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,680
Oh, my, oh, my.

988
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,280
Daddy, but wouldn't
you look handsome

989
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,360
sitting behind the wheel
of a thing like that?

990
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,960
'Course, you know, everything
is in the bone structure.

991
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You know, a person can
tell his whole life

992
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,440
on what his bone
structure is.

993
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,920
I tried pushing her out
a window once in Little Rock.

994
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,840
Oh, I think there's bugs
all over the...

995
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,840
I just hope there's
no snakes around here.

996
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,920
You know,
I think we ought to go now.

997
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,320
Thank you so much.

998
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,280
Now hurry... oh.

999
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,400
Come on, hurry up.

1000
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,920
Get those things in there, now.

1001
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,720
Don't break anything, either.

1002
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,400
Let's go.

1003
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,800
Hurry up, doctor, this baby's
got to go winky-tinky.

1004
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,080
Don't worry.

1005
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,560
Hey!

1006
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,360
Come on, we're ready.

1007
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,080
Come on, now.

1008
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,160
I ain't ready.

1009
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,960
Well, you don't look
real busy with nothing,

1010
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,080
so you just come on down.

1011
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,040
I ain't coming.

1012
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,920
Now you listen here,
child.

1013
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,400
No, I won't listen here.

1014
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,960
What the heck's
up with you, then?

1015
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,400
I want to sit in front.

1016
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,920
And how come
we ain't working no more?

1017
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,600
'Cause we're on vacation,
that's why.

1018
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,600
And Miss Delight and me
are sitting in front

1019
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,200
because we are two grown-ups,

1020
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,200
and that's where grown-ups
do the sitting.

1021
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,040
And little children
do not tell grown-ups

1022
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,240
what to do with their lives,
you understand that?

1023
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,680
Well, she ain't my grown-up,

1024
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,920
and I ain't planning
no more to sit in the back.

1025
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,400
Not for no cow.

1026
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,800
Will you keep your voice down?

1027
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,120
And Miss Delight ain't no cow.

1028
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,320
She's a proper woman.

1029
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,640
She has a high school diploma,

1030
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,560
and right now she's got
to go to the bathroom,

1031
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,080
so you just
get on down to the car.

1032
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,680
She always has
to go to the bathroom.

1033
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,080
She must have a bladder
the size of a peanut.

1034
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,000
Well, I ain't getting
back in that car.

1035
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,600
Not till she gets out of it.

1036
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,160
Hey, what's up, kiddo?

1037
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,960
Daddy says you're
wearing a sad face.

1038
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,520
Ain't good to have
a sad face.

1039
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,560
Hey, how would you like
a coloring book?

1040
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,520
Would you like that?

1041
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,960
You like Mickey the Mouse?

1042
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,920
Oh, son of a bitch.

1043
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,720
Ooh... oh.

1044
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,200
Now come on down to the car
and let's all be friends.

1045
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,000
You see me smile?

1046
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,120
Come on, let's see you smile
like your Aunt Trixie.

1047
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,160
Now, come on.

1048
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,280
Come on down to the car
with mademoiselle.

1049
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,840
Kiddo, I understand
how you feel.

1050
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,600
Well, you don't have to worry.

1051
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,000
One of these days, you're
going to be just as pretty

1052
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,080
as mademoiselle,
maybe prettier.

1053
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,160
You already got bone structure.

1054
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,000
When I was your age, I didn't
have no bone structure.

1055
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,200
Took me years
to get bone structure.

1056
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,320
And don't think bone
structure's not important.

1057
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,720
Nobody started to call me
mademoiselle till I was 17

1058
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,520
and getting
a little bone structure.

1059
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,200
When I was your age, I was
skinnier than a pole.

1060
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,120
I never thought
I'd have nothing up here.

1061
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,000
You're going to have them
up there, too.

1062
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,560
Look, I'll tell you what.

1063
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,360
Want me to show you
how to use cosmetics?

1064
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,120
Look, I'll let you put on
my earrings.

1065
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,320
You can see how pretty
you're going to be.

1066
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,280
And I'll show you how
to make up your eyes.

1067
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,480
And your lips.

1068
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,600
And I'll see to it you get
a little bra or something.

1069
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,760
But right now you're going
to pick your little ass up,

1070
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,360
you're going to drop it
in the backseat

1071
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,560
and you're going to cut out
the crap, you understand?

1072
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,600
You're going to ruin it,
ain't you?

1073
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,040
Look, I don't want
to wipe you out,

1074
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,040
and I don't want you
wiping me out, you know?

1075
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,560
So I'm going
to level with you, okay?

1076
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,960
Now, you see, with me,
it's just a matter of time.

1077
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,040
I don't know why, but somehow

1078
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,720
I just don't manage
to hold on real long.

1079
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,440
So, if you wait it out a little,
it'll be over, you know?

1080
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,280
I mean, even if I want a fella,

1081
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,840
somehow or other I manage
to get it screwed up.

1082
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,920
Maybe I'll get a new pair of
shoes, nice dress, a few laughs.

1083
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,160
Times are hard.

1084
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,800
Now, if you fool around
on the hill up here,

1085
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,120
then you don't get nothing,

1086
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,000
I don't get nothing,
he don't get nothing.

1087
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,960
So how 'bout it, honey?

1088
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,760
Just for a little while,

1089
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,080
let old Trixie sit up front
with her big tits.

1090
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,280
Hey, come on.

1091
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,040
We're coming, baby doll.

1092
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,680
And if you don't find me
some old gas station soon,

1093
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,600
this little old snowflake's
going to wet her pantaloons.

1094
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,920
Oh, my, I almost fell down.

1095
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,760
Yoo-hoo!

1096
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,040
Look what we got!

1097
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,840
Ain't she the sweetest
little thing,

1098
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,200
and don't he look
like a prince on that wheel?

1099
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,320
Now, come on, lmogene.

1100
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,440
Now, get everything in here.

1101
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,400
We got more room than
the whole state of Kansas.

1102
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,520
And listen to the horn.

1103
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,480
Blow the horn, Daddy.

1104
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,080
Oh, go ahead.

1105
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,280
Do it again.

1106
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,000
Sticks his tongue
into the water,

1107
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,200
and there's an alligator
in the river...

1108
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,200
Very funny.

1109
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,240
This girl's sitting
on the trolley,

1110
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,320
and she reaches in her bag,

1111
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,760
and she takes out
this magazine,

1112
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,840
and she starts to read it.

1113
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,880
Well, she ain't read more than
a couple of pages.

1114
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,360
And real slow and careful now,
she takes her stockings down

1115
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,280
and takes off her shoes.

1116
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,040
Now, she turns the stockings
wrong side out,

1117
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,040
and she puts them back on.

1118
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,240
And she puts her shoes back on.

1119
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,680
Well, all the passengers
are watching.

1120
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,680
They wonder what's going on.

1121
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,440
This old guy,
he-he leans over to her,

1122
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,880
and he asks her,
he says, "What's...?"

1123
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,760
"I saw you indulge in a
strange procedure, ma'am.

1124
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,720
What-what were you doing?"

1125
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,160
And she said,
"Well, I was reading

1126
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,320
"this here magazine, you know?

1127
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,880
"And I found it to be
such hot stuff

1128
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,200
"that I... well,
I felt compelled

1129
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,640
to turn the hose on myself."

1130
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,400
Oh, turn the hose on!

1131
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,560
When you said that, I...

1132
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:00,440
They wouldn't have a room
with a canopy bed, would they?

1133
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,680
You wouldn't have a room
with a canopy bed, would you?

1134
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,000
Uh, no.

1135
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,320
But I got one with a fireplace.

1136
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,080
Oh, I'd like that one, daddy.

1137
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,320
It ain't no canopy bed,

1138
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:14,360
but it sure do open up a whole
new can of peas, don't it?

1139
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,480
Can of peas.

1140
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,880
Ain't that cute?

1141
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,280
- Huh? How's that?
- Come on, lmogene.

1142
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,560
Now, help the boy
with these things.

1143
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,400
Give them 234, 235, and 236.

1144
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,160
They're working
on the elevator right now,

1145
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,480
and it's the first flight up,

1146
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,600
if you don't mind.

1147
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,720
- It's all right.
- Thank you.

1148
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,960
- Thank you.
- Can of peas.

1149
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,280
Yeah, what was that all about?

1150
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,560
- Did you hear that?
- Can of peas.

1151
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,040
Well, you know,

1152
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,480
Canopy...
can of pea...

1153
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,840
They rhyme, you know?

1154
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,280
Oh, I see... can of peas,

1155
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,400
- canopy!
- Yeah.

1156
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,600
Oh, I get it now.

1157
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,160
I knew you'd get it
if I explained it to you.

1158
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,520
Picture Henry Ford
without a car

1159
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:54,360
Picture heaven's firmament
without a star

1160
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,440
Picture Grigsby Chrysler
without a fiddle

1161
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,400
Picture poor Philadelphia
without a Biddle

1162
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,240
Picture Central Park
without a sailor

1163
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,200
Picture Mr. Lord
minus his detailer

1164
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,800
Mix 'em all together,
and what have you got?

1165
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,400
Just a picture of me
without you...

1166
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,600
Now there's a rip in the seam
of that dress, lmogene.

1167
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,200
You get it sewed up good,
you hear?

1168
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,240
And wash these hose.

1169
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,640
Yes, Miss Trixie.

1170
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,800
Got my bath ready?

1171
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,920
Yes, Miss Trixie.

1172
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,120
Hope the water's not too hot.

1173
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,400
You've been making that water
awful hot lately, lmogene.

1174
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,000
I knows you like it hot,
Miss Trixie.

1175
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,120
Well, not that hot.

1176
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,840
Now, you go on,
finish up all these things.

1177
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,680
Then you come back in an hour
and dry me off.

1178
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,760
Yes, Miss Trixie.

1179
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,560
What you doing up there?

1180
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,800
I got us an idea.

1181
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,920
Come on.

1182
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,240
What kind of idea?

1183
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,000
Come on in here,
and I'll tell you.

1184
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,560
Go on.

1185
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,640
lmogene, what do you suppose
Miss Trixie would do

1186
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,680
if somebody offered her $25
to put out?

1187
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,960
Oh-wee, you crazy.

1188
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,040
For that much money,

1189
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,480
that women would
drop her pants down

1190
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,640
in the middle of the road.

1191
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,600
That's what I figured.

1192
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,880
What you got in mind?

1193
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,640
You want to get away
from Miss Trixie, don't you?

1194
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,640
Uh-huh.

1195
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,600
Well, if you help me,

1196
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,680
I'll give you enough money

1197
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,640
to get home to your mama.

1198
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,600
- How much money?
- $30.

1199
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,040
When do we start?

1200
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,400
Tomorrow morning.

1201
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,400
Miss Trixie,

1202
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,880
you know that man
down at the desk

1203
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,040
who checked us in yesterday?

1204
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,160
Yeah, I know him.

1205
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,280
What about him?

1206
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,840
Well, he tell me, he'd pay $25

1207
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,640
just to have a good time
with you.

1208
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,760
What?!

1209
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,640
Well, that little two-bit
bum nerve of that guy.

1210
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,440
$25. I bet that little John
don't make that much in a week.

1211
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,800
Where would he get 25 bucks?

1212
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,760
I don't know.

1213
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,080
All I know is what he told me.

1214
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,040
25 bucks, huh?

1215
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,080
Sure have to see the money
to believe it.

1216
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,680
Here you go.

1217
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,840
You come back and see
us again real soon.

1218
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,280
I'll have a Juicy Fruit gum,
please.

1219
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,600
Here you go,
my little beauty.

1220
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,000
Want I should chew it for you?

1221
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,440
Say, you know that
redheaded lady

1222
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,560
that comes down here
named Miss Trixie Delight?

1223
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,760
Yeah.

1224
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,320
Well, she thinks
you're real cute.

1225
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,440
Oh, yeah?

1226
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,560
Says you and who else?

1227
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,240
No, honest. She says
you're better looking

1228
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,280
than Dick Powell.

1229
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,240
She did, eh?

1230
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,000
Well, the lady's got good taste,
don't she?

1231
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,520
Well, just thought
you'd like to know.

1232
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,600
Hey, just a minute.

1233
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,640
Give these

1234
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,680
here to the lady,

1235
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,360
and tell her they're
with Floyd's compliments.

1236
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,120
Oh. She'll like that.

1237
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,160
Maybe you should
write her a note.

1238
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,720
Yeah. What kind of a note?

1239
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,840
Oh, I don't know.

1240
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,720
I thought men always wrote
ladies notes

1241
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,160
when they send them presents.

1242
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,880
Maybe you should ask her
for a date.

1243
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,480
That will sure tickle her.

1244
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,800
Yeah. Maybe I ought to.

1245
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,400
Say,

1246
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,720
she's not married up
or anything like that, is she?

1247
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,360
Of course not.

1248
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,480
She don't even have
a regular boyfriend.

1249
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,480
That man who come in here
yesterday with her is my daddy.

1250
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,800
He's her manager.

1251
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,040
She's a dancer.

1252
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,160
A dancer?

1253
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,560
You know, I figured
she was something like that.

1254
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,760
Whereabouts she dance?

1255
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,040
Oh, lots of big places.

1256
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,160
She's a star.

1257
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,640
Well, how about that!

1258
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,920
Why don't you print it?

1259
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,240
She like men who prints.

1260
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,240
Print it, huh?

1261
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,040
"Some sweets for the sweet.

1262
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,160
"Ha, ha.

1263
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,960
"Some girls say I'm a pretty
smooth dancer myself.

1264
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
How about trying me out
sometime?"

1265
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,240
You sure this is
going to work?

1266
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,520
I don't know, but we're sure
going to give it a try.

1267
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,000
Throw this in the drawer,
will you?

1268
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:03,440
And keep your fingers crossed.

1269
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,920
Who is it?

1270
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,080
It's me, Addie.

1271
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,720
Oh. What do you want?

1272
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,640
I got a message from Moze.

1273
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,600
He asked me to tell you

1274
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,320
he had to run over
to Hainesville today.

1275
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,800
He won't be back
until suppertime.

1276
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,080
Huh?

1277
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,680
I think he had to get something
fixed on his car.

1278
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,640
He'll be gone all day.

1279
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,800
Oh.

1280
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,040
Well... okay.

1281
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,480
Okay!

1282
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,200
Howdy.

1283
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,320
Howdy.

1284
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,440
What you having?

1285
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,560
Waffles.

1286
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,680
I already ate.

1287
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,840
I had waffles, too.

1288
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,720
They sure are good, ain't they?

1289
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,720
They ain't bad for waffles.

1290
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,080
Mr. Moze,
Miss Trixie don't feel so good.

1291
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,920
She say she's going
to stay in bed today.

1292
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,840
She say she'll see you
around suppertime.

1293
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,960
She sick? Sick in bed?

1294
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,240
I-I better go up there.

1295
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,440
Oh, she ain't

1296
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,480
real sick.

1297
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,760
Ain't nothing to worry about.

1298
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,200
She's just having
her lady's time.

1299
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,240
Oh.

1300
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,160
Well, you tell her
I'll see her this evening.

1301
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,320
Well, just wanted
to say good morning.

1302
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,040
I think I'll go upstairs
and polish my shoes.

1303
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,480
Somebody at the door, lmogene.

1304
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,920
Yes, Miss Trixie.

1305
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,000
It's something for you,
Miss Trixie.

1306
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,120
Oh, what is it?

1307
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,760
It was outside the door.

1308
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,680
What is that?

1309
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,960
lmogene, let all that go now.

1310
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,080
You can run along.

1311
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,560
I'll call you when I need you.

1312
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,480
Yes, Miss Trixie.

1313
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,680
Well, hello, cupid.

1314
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,960
Miss Trixie wants to see you.

1315
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,240
She says it's real important.

1316
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,480
Room 235.

1317
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,480
Oh, she does, does she? When?

1318
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,600
Right now.

1319
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,080
Well, I can't get off right now.

1320
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,560
But she says
it's real important.

1321
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,920
Well, you tell her
I'll come up later tonight...

1322
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,160
when the moon is full.

1323
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,000
But you can't come tonight.

1324
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,960
She won't even be here
after tonight.

1325
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,200
Matter of fact,

1326
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,440
she won't even be here
after today.

1327
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,600
She won't, huh?

1328
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:06,880
Well...

1329
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,360
You won't be sorry.

1330
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,240
I guess I could go up
for a few minutes.

1331
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,160
What's that room number again?

1332
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,520
Room 235.

1333
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,000
She's waiting for ya.

1334
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,120
Okay.

1335
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,280
You tell her
I'm on my way up, sweetheart.

1336
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,480
He's coming!
He's coming!

1337
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,400
Who is it?

1338
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,480
Sheik of Araby.

1339
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,600
Well, then,
don't you look pretty?

1340
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,520
Well, come on in, honey.

1341
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,360
Come on.

1342
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,800
...you don't give
a girl much time.

1343
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,200
Oh, I manage to get around.

1344
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,720
Say, you're not
one of these fellows

1345
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,280
goes around babbling,
are you, honey?

1346
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,240
What do you mean?

1347
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,360
Well, you know,

1348
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,640
now most of the time
I don't mind,

1349
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,920
but it's important to me
right now

1350
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:08,880
not to get talked about.

1351
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,920
Hey, now do I look like
that kind of fellow?

1352
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,000
S-Say, you are a wild one,
aren't you?

1353
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,280
Hold it, hold it!

1354
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,240
Now, wait a minute,

1355
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,360
you're going to tear it!

1356
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,280
Now, now,
just let me slip it off.

1357
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,400
Hey, there.

1358
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,120
Well, now, ain't you a show dog?

1359
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,240
Ooh... ooh!

1360
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,880
I'm going.

1361
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,760
The key.

1362
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,440
Give me the key.

1363
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,800
Mr. Moze's going
to kill that man.

1364
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,520
He's going to kill them both,
I just knows it.

1365
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,880
Wait for me here.

1366
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,240
Okay.

1367
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,440
Moze!

1368
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,880
What's the trouble?

1369
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,960
Better go up to Trixie's room
right away.

1370
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,480
Why? What? She sick?

1371
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,200
No, she's not sick.
Just do what I tell you.

1372
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,200
And take the elevator.

1373
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,600
Don't knock. Use the key.

1374
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,880
Your daddy going
to kill that man, I reckon.

1375
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,360
I expect he cut him up
pretty bad.

1376
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,920
Moze wouldn't do
a thing like that.

1377
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,640
Well, down home,
when a man come in from work,

1378
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,120
and hear a man inside house
in bed with his wife,

1379
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,080
he just walk around
to the woodpile

1380
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,760
and get his double-blade ax,
and go inside,

1381
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,600
chop 'em both up
to little pieces.

1382
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,680
Folks say he cut 'em up
just like kindling wood.

1383
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,520
Get your things, Addie.
We're leaving.

1384
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,680
Now?

1385
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,720
Right this minute.

1386
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,600
I swan, I don't know
why that girl

1387
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,360
did such a thing to me.

1388
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,760
I'd have done almost anything
for that girl.

1389
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,720
Just ain't fair.

1390
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:40,080
I reckon she's been...
carrying on a long time.

1391
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,200
From the start.

1392
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,120
You mean,
there were other men?

1393
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,240
Lots of 'em.

1394
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,160
Well, dadblammit,
why didn't you tell me?

1395
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,520
I just knew you
wouldn't believe me.

1396
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,280
I want you to promise me
just one thing.

1397
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,920
What, Moze?

1398
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:56,240
When you grow up,

1399
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,640
don't you be the kind of woman
who goes around deceiving men.

1400
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,920
Promise me that.

1401
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,000
I promise, Moze.

1402
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:25,160
Oh, my love,
let's take a walk

1403
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:30,560
Just a little ways away

1404
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:35,720
While we walk along,
we'll talk

1405
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:40,640
Talk about our wedding day

1406
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:45,600
Only say
that you'll be mine

1407
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:51,240
And in our home,
we'll happy be

1408
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:56,640
Down beside
where the waters flow

1409
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,400
Down on the banks
of the Ohio...

1410
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,360
Moze?

1411
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,360
Hmm?

1412
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,320
Moze, pay attention.

1413
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,360
What's the trouble?

1414
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,200
I seen
something peculiar.

1415
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,160
What's that?

1416
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,360
That man in there.

1417
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,320
What man?

1418
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,440
Standing
by the door.

1419
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,120
What's peculiar about him?

1420
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:15,160
He's got a roll of money
could choke us both to death.

1421
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,040
Well, I'm not up to
anything right now.

1422
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,240
But he's got a black book
for making notes in,

1423
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,480
and all that money,

1424
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:24,040
and he keeps going outside
and then coming back in again.

1425
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,560
- Bootlegger.
- Bootlegger?

1426
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,880
No question about it.

1427
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,840
You think we might do
some business with him?

1428
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,520
Maybe drop a wad or something?

1429
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,880
We ain't done nothing
in two months,

1430
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,960
ever since Trixie.

1431
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,320
And we only have $212 left.

1432
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,040
Better ways of doing
business with bootleggers.

1433
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,080
What ways?

1434
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,000
Oh, heaps of ways.

1435
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,920
Look, he's going out again!

1436
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,360
Follow him.

1437
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,360
Should I, Moze?

1438
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,360
I told you, didn't I?

1439
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,320
Follow him.

1440
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,480
Find out where he goes.

1441
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,960
...thinking "Lord,
what a deed I have done!"

1442
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,040
Killed the girl I loved,
you see

1443
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:02,080
'Cause she would not
marry me

1444
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:07,640
Only say that you'll be mine

1445
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:13,160
And in our home,
we'll happy be

1446
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:17,800
Down beside
where the waters flow

1447
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:22,840
Down on the banks
of the Ohio...

1448
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,200
Thank you.

1449
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:18,880
Big brown eyes
and curly hair...

1450
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:19,840
What'd you find out?

1451
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,960
He's got a
lot of bottles

1452
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,320
he keeps in some
kind of bin out back.

1453
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,320
How big's the bin?

1454
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,760
About as big as our
car trunk, maybe.

1455
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:25,720
What you plan to do?

1456
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,040
Find out where
he keeps his goods.

1457
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,600
Well, there was a little shack
out there, too,

1458
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:29,600
but he didn't go in it.

1459
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,600
Mm-hmm.

1460
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,680
Well, honey...

1461
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,880
how about a little walk before
Daddy puts you in the bed?

1462
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:36,840
Oh, goody.

1463
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,640
Our friend's name
is Jess Hardin.

1464
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:42,760
He's a bootlegger, all right.

1465
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,720
Wholesales pretty near
everybody in the county.

1466
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,240
His brother's some sort
of a big shot, too,

1467
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,120
but the girl couldn't
tell me about him.

1468
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,240
Some Romeo walked up,
and I had to beat it.

1469
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:51,200
Now where is it?

1470
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,240
Right over there.

1471
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:53,440
Okay, come on.

1472
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,360
Okay, now, you watch the hotel.

1473
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:01,880
You see anybody coming,
you cough real low.

1474
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,840
I'm going inside.

1475
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,800
It may be locked.

1476
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,800
Shucks, honey,

1477
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,360
folks in the country
never lock anything.

1478
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,720
Don't you know that?

1479
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:39,440
Come sit by my side,
little darling

1480
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:46,600
Come lay your cool hand
on my brow

1481
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:52,400
Promise me that you will never

1482
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,360
Be nobody's...

1483
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,880
Your name Hardin?

1484
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,440
That's right.

1485
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,760
Conrad's the name.

1486
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,640
Jack said I ought
to look you up.

1487
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,360
Jack who?

1488
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,120
Oh, just Jack's good enough,
I reckon.

1489
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,680
Don't know no Jack.

1490
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,120
Well, maybe you ought
to get acquainted.

1491
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,360
He's running the biggest
wholesale business in the state.

1492
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,480
You selling?

1493
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,440
That's right.

1494
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,200
Ain't interested
in no shiney.

1495
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,760
I ain't selling no shiney,
I only deal in bonded goods.

1496
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,520
- What kind?
- All kinds.

1497
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,920
I can let you have a pretty good
deal on some Three Feathers.

1498
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:23,040
How much?

1499
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,040
Well, it depends.

1500
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,000
You take 20 cases,

1501
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,520
I'll let 'em go for $25 per.

1502
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,920
- That's too much.
- Ain't too much.

1503
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,040
You can't get it that cheap
where they sell it legal.

1504
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,120
Ain't legal here.

1505
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,240
That's all the more reason
you're getting a bargain.

1506
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,200
Give you just $20.

1507
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,280
Can't do it.

1508
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,720
Price is set down in Wichita.

1509
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,480
How long before delivery?

1510
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,960
Oh... how's early
in the morning?

1511
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
You got it in the county?

1512
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,480
That's right.

1513
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,760
...that nobody knows

1514
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:56,560
My mother is dead
and in heaven...

1515
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,640
Where do I pick it up?

1516
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,960
My daddy...

1517
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,440
That'll do it.

1518
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,480
Did you leave some?

1519
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,000
Plenty.
He'll never miss it.

1520
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,040
Moze?

1521
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,320
Moze,
we better get.

1522
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,240
- Here.
- It's all filled up, I told you.

1523
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,720
Them's for me.

1524
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,120
Get going!

1525
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,960
Hurry.

1526
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,760
Get up there!

1527
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,240
Now hold on.

1528
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,400
And make sure
nothing spills off.

1529
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,600
Well, you'd better go slow.

1530
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,360
And hurry.

1531
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,160
Easy!

1532
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,200
Well, I got to turn corners,
don't I?

1533
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,320
Moze, ain't he going
to miss his whiskey?

1534
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,640
Oh, maybe in about a week,

1535
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:50,840
but by the time
he's figured it out,

1536
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,800
we'll be in Missouri,

1537
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:54,000
and he can't do nothing
once we're in Missouri.

1538
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,440
Come on.

1539
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,200
Where is it?

1540
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,680
Scoot over!

1541
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,200
How much you get?

1542
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,480
$625.

1543
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:51,120
$625, and he bought
his own whiskey!

1544
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,120
That's $625 plus the $212
we already got.

1545
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:17,480
And if we drop some wallets
and do some 20s, we'll...

1546
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,600
What's that?

1547
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,880
Where?

1548
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,000
Behind us.

1549
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,360
I don't see nothin'.

1550
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,000
There's something back there.

1551
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,520
Nothin' but pitch black.

1552
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,960
I thought I seen
something flicker.

1553
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,120
Nothin' there.

1554
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,040
You put the money in the box?

1555
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,320
Uh-huh.

1556
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:34,760
I'll be glad
to get out of this town,

1557
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:35,840
I'll tell you that.

1558
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,200
There it is again.

1559
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,480
Dadblammit!

1560
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:43,880
Somethin' flickered,
sure as hell.

1561
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,880
Nothin' 'hind us, Moze.

1562
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,680
Uh-oh.

1563
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,600
I told ya!

1564
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,480
Who could it be?

1565
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:55,760
Christ!

1566
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,840
Don't stop, keep going!

1567
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,920
I can't keep going.

1568
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,360
The damn car's in front of me.

1569
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:08,720
Everything's going to be
all right.

1570
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:09,960
You just let me do the talking.

1571
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,360
You playin' games with us,
Mister?

1572
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,640
Oh, I-I didn't know
who was back there.

1573
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:21,760
It's a risky thing to do.

1574
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,680
Might get your tires shot off.

1575
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,880
Where you headin'?

1576
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:27,200
Me and my little girl
are going to Saint Jo.

1577
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,160
Oh. Live there?

1578
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,200
Nearby.

1579
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,440
What's your business?

1580
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,960
Uh, livestock, mostly...
mules and horses.

1581
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:35,920
Some cattle.

1582
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,600
That's funny.

1583
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,640
I heard you was a bootlegger.

1584
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,960
Oh, no, sir, not me, friend.

1585
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,240
Must be some mistake.

1586
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,000
Maybe.

1587
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,080
Maybe not.

1588
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:55,920
The way I hear it...

1589
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,440
you just had a transaction
by the old barn.

1590
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,320
Where'd you hear
a thing like that?

1591
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,080
Oh, a... friend of the family.

1592
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,520
No, I'm sorry.

1593
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,000
I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

1594
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:07,080
I'm talkin' about bootleggin'.

1595
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,880
I'm talkin' about $625.

1596
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,280
Now, just where might that be?

1597
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,360
I don't have no $625.

1598
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,440
I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

1599
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,480
I don't even know where
the old barn is.

1600
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,600
Well...

1601
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,320
I reckon we'll just
have to explain

1602
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,120
a little more
thoroughly, won't we?

1603
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,080
Come on, Beau,

1604
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,080
you take a ride with
these nice people.

1605
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,040
Love to.

1606
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,480
We're all goin' back to town.

1607
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,200
Hmm.

1608
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,600
Damn.

1609
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:46,320
Just when you think
you got it made...

1610
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:49,040
just ain't made, is it?

1611
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,080
You pretty good at
this little thing?

1612
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,360
Not too good.

1613
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,880
Not too good, huh?

1614
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,920
Old bootlegger's sittin' there
with his own little game,

1615
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:00,960
and he ain't even good
at his own game.

1616
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,000
Yes, sir,
that is some good joke.

1617
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,360
I found these on the front seat.

1618
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,640
Wasn't any money in the car.

1619
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,880
Went all through it,
inside and out.

1620
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,240
Livestock business, huh?

1621
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,760
That w-whiskey's for a friend.

1622
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,400
Hold out your hands.

1623
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,520
Huh?

1624
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:24,640
I said, hold out your hands.

1625
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,120
You heard me.

1626
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,160
I didn't say put 'em down,
did I?

1627
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,240
Mighty clean hands
for livestock.

1628
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:42,720
Them hands don't look like
they do nothin' in life

1629
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:45,080
except play a little casino
every now and then.

1630
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,240
I told you,
that whiskey's for a friend.

1631
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,400
I didn't see no harm in buying
a couple of bottles...

1632
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,360
Didn't see no harm?

1633
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,080
Hear that, Beau?

1634
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,640
Big bootlegger claims
he don't know the law.

1635
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:53,880
Well, Mr. Bootlegger,

1636
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,800
I don't need
no couple of bottles

1637
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,440
to make a case against you.

1638
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,280
Law says all I need is just
one little ol' drop.

1639
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,040
And law says
you use a vehicle

1640
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,920
to transport
alcoholic beverages,

1641
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,720
and said vehicle
is confiscated

1642
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,800
to be sold
at public auctions, so...

1643
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,920
you can just kiss

1644
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,920
that pretty little ol' car
of yours good-bye.

1645
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,880
Hey, hold on! That seems
pretty rough just because...

1646
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:14,000
Don't lower your hands.

1647
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,280
I didn't tell you to
lower your hands.

1648
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,440
I tell you to lower your hands,
then you lower your hands.

1649
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,000
You don't do nothin'
until I tell you to.

1650
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,120
Understand?

1651
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,440
Answer me.
You understand?

1652
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,440
Yes, sir.

1653
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,680
Ah, I already done that.

1654
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,600
Ain't nothin' in his
clothes 'cept him.

1655
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,320
He ain't worth five cents.

1656
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,920
No, she ain't got
nothin' on her, either.

1657
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,480
You don't know what kind

1658
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,400
of real bad
trouble you're in.

1659
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,480
You better start
thinking on it.

1660
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,520
I've got a case against you

1661
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,200
for possession and
transportin' whiskey,

1662
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,320
and I reckon if I try,

1663
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,800
I can think
of a few other things.

1664
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,000
Better face it,
you're going to be

1665
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,600
up in these parts
for quite a while,

1666
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,240
working on the county roads.

1667
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,960
Maybe you're lucky,
you get out in six months.

1668
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,200
Six more months...
influencing a child...

1669
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,760
maybe get six years for that.

1670
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,680
M-Maybe we could work
something out.

1671
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,640
What's there to work out?

1672
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:09,280
...while I rustle one up,

1673
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,560
you all listen
to this little goodie

1674
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,000
from a couple of years ago...

1675
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,880
Ah, I sure don't like
to send a man

1676
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,120
to a road gang.
Never have.

1677
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,800
Always felt sorry
for them poor devils.

1678
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:24,640
But I can't overlook the fact
that you've been paid $625,

1679
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:27,200
and you ain't tellin' me
where it is.

1680
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,480
Now, I know
you're a bootlegger,

1681
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,960
so what's there for me
to work out?

1682
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,000
All right.

1683
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:34,920
Let's cut this
ring-around-the-rosy.

1684
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,360
Where's that... money?

1685
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,920
You think I'm foolin' around?

1686
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,000
I ain't foolin' around.

1687
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,960
Maybe you'll come around

1688
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,240
in time.

1689
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:12,480
Get a little thirsty
and get a little hungry.

1690
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,400
Time sure does have
a way with criminals,

1691
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,520
don't it, Beau?

1692
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:16,640
Sure do.

1693
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,000
Well, it's gettin'
on to 5:00.

1694
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:20,200
Somebody ought to be
stirring over at the cafe.

1695
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,920
I think I'll step
over there a while.

1696
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,000
See if that friend of the family
is there.

1697
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:25,280
I'll be on back 'fore long.

1698
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,400
I got all day, you know?

1699
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:28,000
I got all the time in the world.

1700
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,640
...let's have
another piece of pie

1701
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:33,120
Trouble's just a bubble

1702
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,600
And the clouds will soon roll by

1703
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,520
So let's have
another cup of coffee

1704
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,360
And let's have
another piece of pie

1705
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,920
Let a smile be your umbrella

1706
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,400
For it's just
an April shower

1707
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,640
Even John D. Rockefeller...

1708
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,920
Sir, may I get my things,
please?

1709
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,760
Mr. Herbert Hoover says
that now's the time to buy

1710
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:52,720
Okay.

1711
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:55,920
So let's have
another cup of coffee

1712
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,600
And let's have
another piece of pie.

1713
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,920
Daddy...

1714
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,200
I need to go to the shithouse.

1715
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:45,880
Well, uh, there's a place
down the hall.

1716
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,520
Daddy, I'm scared.

1717
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,320
I want you
to come stand by the door.

1718
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,480
All right if I go with her?

1719
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,960
Down there.

1720
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,360
Run!

1721
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,640
You crazy?!

1722
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,000
Hey!

1723
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,360
Where are we running?

1724
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,480
Oh, my God.

1725
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:19,600
Stop them people!

1726
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,640
Hey, there's
bootleggers...!

1727
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,040
Jesus Christ,
this is the craziest...

1728
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,160
Hurry!

1729
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,320
I'm hurryin'!

1730
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,360
Stop!

1731
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,920
Oh, Jesus!

1732
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:46,360
- I'm going to hit him!
- Make him jump! Don't slow down!

1733
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,280
I could have killed him!

1734
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:50,600
They're going to have me up
for murder!

1735
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:53,080
They're shooting at us!

1736
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,720
- But they're missin'!
- Keep going!

1737
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:04,320
We ain't gonna make it.

1738
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,320
Yes, we will.

1739
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,280
Not in this car, we ain't.

1740
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,400
Every two-bit lawman in Kansas

1741
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,800
is going to be looking
for this car.

1742
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:10,400
We got to get across
the river to Missouri.

1743
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:11,680
Where's the bridge?

1744
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,680
Oh, Jesus!

1745
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:13,920
What's the matter?

1746
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,200
Damn bridge is the other way!

1747
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,440
- What?!
- Hang on.

1748
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:41,800
Ah, this ain't no good.

1749
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,640
We're gonna make it
too easy for 'em.

1750
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,520
We got to get off this road.
Hang on!

1751
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,600
Holy smoke!

1752
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:54,720
Blow your horn!

1753
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:55,680
Won't do no good.

1754
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,000
He can't pull off the road.

1755
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,320
Ain't we got all the luck,

1756
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,240
selling whiskey to
a sheriff's brother?!

1757
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,520
Hang onto your hat.

1758
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,560
- What?
- Hold on, I said.

1759
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,560
Oh, God.

1760
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,720
You all right?

1761
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:22,920
Uh-huh.

1762
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,560
Okay, we threw a hobble
on 'em for a while,

1763
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:25,760
but we got to get off this road,

1764
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:27,480
or we're going to end up
in a town for sure.

1765
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:29,080
And take that money
out of there.

1766
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,840
You liked to give
me heart failure.

1767
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,120
We made it, didn't we?!

1768
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:26,400
Anybody 'thome?

1769
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,360
Howdy.

1770
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,040
Need to get rid of my car here.

1771
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:42,520
I need to get rid of my car!

1772
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,640
Sheriff wants to take away
my little girl,

1773
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,960
put her in an orphanage.

1774
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,320
You know anybody
who might want to swap?

1775
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:54,880
How about that truck over there?

1776
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,600
Well, we'll just let him
chew on it a while.

1777
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:11,360
Well, the rear tires
look new, anyway.

1778
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,400
The radio looks okay.

1779
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:27,680
Think this thing runs?

1780
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:30,480
It better... we got to have
some way of traveling.

1781
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:31,640
Where we going to go?

1782
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:34,720
Out of Kansas, across the river
to Saint Jo, that's where.

1783
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:37,840
Here he comes.

1784
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,040
Look at 'em all.

1785
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:04,000
All I'm looking for is a swap
and three days' head start

1786
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,720
before you take it out
on the highway.

1787
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,520
It's all legal.

1788
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,840
Got the papers right here
to prove it.

1789
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,960
Just have to fill out that form
on the back, and you own it.

1790
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,200
Ain't gonna swap.

1791
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,520
Well, it's brand-new.

1792
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,880
That car ain't no good.

1793
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,200
What's the matter with it?

1794
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:28,840
Can't haul nothing in it.

1795
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,400
Oh, well, if that's all
that's bothering you,

1796
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:31,520
you can sell the car

1797
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,120
and get two trucks
t'do your hauling in.

1798
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,880
I ain't gonna swap.

1799
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,240
Wrassle you for it.

1800
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:40,040
- Are you crazy?
- If I win, we swap.

1801
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,120
You win, you can keep the car
and the truck both.

1802
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:43,080
- Moze...
- Quiet down.

1803
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,640
What kind of wrassling?

1804
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,480
You name it.

1805
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,200
Catch as can?

1806
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:48,320
Shoes or barefoot?

1807
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,240
Makes no nevermind to me.

1808
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,800
Barefoot.

1809
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,200
You're gonna get killed
just to give something away.

1810
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:07,160
I ain't got no choice.

1811
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,400
Get that city boy.

1812
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,280
Get the city boy.

1813
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,760
Let's go.

1814
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,560
Make him say "calf rope," Leroy.

1815
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:24,600
Come on, Leroy.

1816
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:27,840
Get him, Leroy. Get him!

1817
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,520
That ain't fair!
You stop that!

1818
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:33,880
You make him fight fair!

1819
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:36,040
Look out for that rake, Leroy.

1820
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:38,160
Watch out, Leroy.

1821
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,480
Let's go in the car. Come on!

1822
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,360
Yee-haw!

1823
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,320
Are you pushing?!

1824
01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:02,040
Of course I'm pushing!

1825
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,960
Okay, it'll go now.

1826
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,280
Put your foot on the brake.

1827
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,560
The brake! The brake!

1828
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,960
It don't work!

1829
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,880
The brake, goddamn it!

1830
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,680
The brake!

1831
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,600
Don't you even know
where the damn brake is?

1832
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:43,240
It don't work.

1833
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,320
Oh. Well, it figures.

1834
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,280
Well, we're in Missouri anyway.

1835
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:51,720
What'll we do now,
drop some 20s?

1836
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,080
How much money we got?

1837
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,600
837 and some change.

1838
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,280
42 cents, I think.

1839
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,320
Well, we're just outside
of St. Jo, ain't we?

1840
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,960
So what?

1841
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,520
So... it's a big town,
ain't it?

1842
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,720
We can do better than 20s.

1843
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,080
Y'all know that one...

1844
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,240
"Let's have
another cup of coffee,

1845
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,520
let's have
another piece of pie."

1846
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,720
Well, it's 10:30,
and it's Sunday morning

1847
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:21,280
in St. Jo, and y'all get
to church now, okay?

1848
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,840
Here's the news...

1849
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,560
- Moze?
- Yeah?

1850
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,160
What if that old man
don't believe ya?

1851
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,280
He'll believe me, all right.

1852
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,040
He's in the market
for making a killing,

1853
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,000
just like we are.

1854
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,600
Maybe he don't even have
a silver mine.

1855
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:35,200
I had him checked out
real thorough.

1856
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:36,160
Where's the money?

1857
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,760
And he's just what
people say he is...

1858
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,040
rich and greedy.

1859
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:42,720
The independent candidate
for Senate this year...

1860
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:44,000
Pull up your socks.

1861
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,400
Moze, if we get a silver mine,

1862
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,680
we could get a house
and everything, couldn't we?

1863
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:50,240
Everything,
just... everything.

1864
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,840
Just around the corner,
there's a rainbow in the sky

1865
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,640
So let's have
another cup of coffee...

1866
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:55,840
Okay, you got
it straight?

1867
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,600
Corner of East Warring
and Burlington.

1868
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,840
11:00. Just show there
with tears in your eyes.

1869
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:02,600
- That's all.
- Moze, don't forget the money.

1870
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:06,040
Of course I won't forget
the money.

1871
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,360
I'll see you in 30 minutes.

1872
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,400
Moze, could we get a piano, too?

1873
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,680
A piano?

1874
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:12,080
We'll have a whole factory.

1875
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,720
Just around the corner

1876
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,720
There's a rainbow in the sky.

1877
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,000
...conservation
of natural resources.

1878
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:50,400
I guess you just didn't make
a good enough swap.

1879
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:53,120
My brother's real sore at ya.

1880
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:55,960
Seems you sold him
some of his own whiskey.

1881
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,600
You can't arrest me now.
We're in Missouri.

1882
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:00,920
And your damn brother's
a bootlegger!

1883
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:05,120
You got an awful big mouth,
mister.

1884
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,320
Maybe I can't arrest you
in Missouri,

1885
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,080
and maybe I don't want to.

1886
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,400
But I sure can make sure

1887
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:13,400
that you ain't gonna feel
real good while you're here.

1888
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:20,960
Let's go!

1889
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,080
Addie...

1890
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:13,360
Addie...

1891
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,760
Moze.

1892
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:22,880
Moze...

1893
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:23,840
I sw...

1894
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:26,080
I swallowed my gold tooth.

1895
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:27,080
Aw, Moze.

1896
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,040
They took it all.

1897
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:29,400
Oh, Moze, you'reall beat up.

1898
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,520
Ain't nothing left.

1899
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,640
Don't worry none.

1900
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,560
I've been keeping ten
dollars for emergencies.

1901
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:34,840
Ten dollars?

1902
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,440
What the hell we do
with ten dollars?

1903
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:37,760
We could buy some Bibles,

1904
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,240
do a little widow business.

1905
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,960
Must be lots of good
towns around here.

1906
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,440
Do some 20s, drop
some wallets...

1907
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,960
before you know it,
we'll be real good again.

1908
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,160
I'll bet in no time

1909
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:50,600
we could have a whole
new car and everything.

1910
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:03,040
You're going to take me
to Aunt Billie's now, ain't ya?

1911
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:07,600
- Aw, Moze...
- Don't start crying.

1912
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:08,560
I won't.

1913
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,760
That's where we set out for,
ain't it?

1914
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:27,560
Looks nice.

1915
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,840
Yeah, it looks real fine.

1916
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:35,480
That must be
your uncle Daniel.

1917
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,280
He looks nice, too, don't he?

1918
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:38,920
Yup. Real nice.

1919
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,120
Maybe if
Frank D. Roosevelt comes,

1920
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:45,400
he'll tell him to take me
to the station to see him.

1921
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,560
Maybe you write, ol' Frankie'll

1922
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,000
have a place to write you
back now.

1923
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,320
Yeah, he might, at that.

1924
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,280
'Course he will.

1925
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,960
Ain't no question but he will.

1926
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,040
All this talk's just
wasting time.

1927
01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:11,520
Here's your...

1928
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:13,760
here, your skates,
your radio.

1929
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:14,880
Where you gonna go?

1930
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:16,600
Don't worry about me.
I got plans.

1931
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,280
New ideas coming in every day.

1932
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,360
Get going.

1933
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:25,720
You know, if I knew for sure
you wasn't my pa...

1934
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:29,960
It's for sure I ain't your pa.

1935
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,560
Although sometimes
I used to figure

1936
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,480
Mr. Connors
could have been my pa,

1937
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:35,280
the way he touched my shoulder,

1938
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:38,480
get me things
from the candy counter for free.

1939
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:41,960
And Mr. Pritchard,
he smiled at me once real nice,

1940
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,320
except they don't have my jaw
or nothing.

1941
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:49,080
So long.

1942
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,360
Ain't you coming
to the door with me?

1943
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:52,760
There it is, right there.

1944
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:55,160
How much closer
am I supposed to bring you?

1945
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,000
They'll wonder how I got here.

1946
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:58,720
Tell 'em a family friend
brung you,

1947
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:00,920
and you-you had
a little trouble on the way

1948
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,320
with your car and with finances.

1949
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:04,600
Now, get going.

1950
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,760
Yes?

1951
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,360
Yes?

1952
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,280
I'm Addie.

1953
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,240
Addie?

1954
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:58,480
Addie, I've been
worried sick about you.

1955
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:01,040
Addie...
come on in, child.

1956
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,640
I been writing letters,
and your Uncle Daniel's

1957
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:12,600
been trying to call
those people down there

1958
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:13,760
to see where you've been.

1959
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:16,440
You're just the spitting
image of your mother,

1960
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:17,640
pretty as a picture.

1961
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:19,400
I don't know why
I go on like this...

1962
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,400
what you need is
some ice-cold lemonade.

1963
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:26,080
Now you just sit right there,
and I'll be right back.

1964
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:29,440
Everybody's going to be
so happy to see you.

1965
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:33,040
We're going to get
those clothes off of you.

1966
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,840
You're going to get into
a nice, fresh, bath...

1967
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:39,400
and then you're going to sleep
in your own little bed,

1968
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,280
alongside your cousin, Edna.

1969
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:44,320
I just near give
up on you, child.

1970
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:46,720
I bet you're starving
to death.

1971
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:49,880
I'm going to cut you
a big piece of pie.

1972
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:52,960
We got those telegrams,

1973
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,240
and then we never did hear
from ya.

1974
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I told you, I don't want you
riding with me no more.

1975
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:56,360
You still owe me $200.

1976
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,240
Moze, look!

1977
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:12,960
Come on.

1978
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,800
Hurry up.

1979
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:05,720
Keep your sunny side up

1980
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:09,960
Keep it up high,
the side that gets blue

1981
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,880
If you have nine sons
in a row

1982
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:18,080
Start a baseball team,
they make money, you know

1983
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:21,960
Keep your funny side up...
don't let up

1984
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,600
Let your laughter come through

1985
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:25,800
Doodley-doo

1986
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,800
Stand up on your legs

1987
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,680
Be like two fried eggs

1988
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:32,600
Keep your sunny side up.
