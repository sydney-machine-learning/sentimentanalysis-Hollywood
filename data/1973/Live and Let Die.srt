1
00:01:22,573 --> 00:01:25,992
...was so ably pointed out
by the Secretary-General

2
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:27,869
in his opening remarks.

3
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,539
But, and I must emphasize this point,

4
00:01:31,832 --> 00:01:37,128
no formula can or will
ever cover each case.

5
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:40,381
For instance...

6
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:48,556
...when three or more applicants
have been recognized,

7
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:52,185
which is in direct contradiction to...

8
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,756
Whose funeral is it?

9
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,342
Yours.

10
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:58,245
When you were young

11
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,375
And your heart was an open book

12
00:05:04,795 --> 00:05:08,673
You used to say live and let live

13
00:05:09,174 --> 00:05:12,885
You know you did, you know you did
You know you did

14
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:18,391
But if this ever-changing world
in which we live in

15
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:23,062
Makes you give in and cry

16
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,150
Say live and let die

17
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:41,372
Live and let die

18
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:12,361
What does it matter to ya?

19
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,782
When you got a job to do,
you got to do it well

20
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:21,537
You got to give
the other fellow hell

21
00:06:46,563 --> 00:06:49,940
You used to say live and let live

22
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:54,070
You know you did, you know you did
You know you did

23
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:59,825
But if this ever-changing world
in which we live in

24
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,121
Makes you give in and cry

25
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,376
Say live and let die

26
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:22,264
Live and let die

27
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:58,259
One more time again?

28
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,400
Not married by any chance, are you?

29
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:29,874
Good morning, 007.

30
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:32,501
Good morning.

31
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,507
- Insomnia, sir?
- Instructions.

32
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,262
You haven't much time.
I'll explain as you pack.

33
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:46,098
Pack, sir?

34
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:48,934
Three of our agents have been killed
during the last 24 hours.

35
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,604
Dawes in New York.
Hamilton in New Orleans.

36
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:55,691
- And Baines in the Caribbean.
- Baines, I rather liked Baines.

37
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:57,860
We shared the same bootmaker.

38
00:08:58,486 --> 00:09:01,197
Coffee, sir?

39
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,585
I take it these killings are connected.

40
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:18,047
That's precisely
what you're going to find out.

41
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:30,184
Baines was working on a small island
in the Caribbean called San Monique.

42
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:33,229
Dawes was in New York

43
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:36,649
keeping an eye on its prime minister,
one Dr. Kananga.

44
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:39,318
Hamilton was on loan to the Americans
in New Orleans.

45
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,492
Is that all it does?

46
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:50,704
By the way,
congratulations seem to be in order.

47
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:54,667
The Italians were most impressed
by the way you handled the Rome affair.

48
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:56,835
Thank you, sir. Sugar?

49
00:09:58,755 --> 00:09:59,838
Thanks.

50
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:02,675
Well, the authorities
were more than helpful.

51
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:05,928
There's one small complaint.

52
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,807
They seem to be missing
one of their agents,

53
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,768
a Miss Caruso.

54
00:10:15,605 --> 00:10:17,982
You wouldn't happen
to know where she is?

55
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:21,235
Miss Moneypenny.

56
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:23,153
Morning, Moneypenny.

57
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,699
- Good morning, sir.
- Certainly the hour that's indecent.

58
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:30,202
Really? I've got your ticket to New York.

59
00:10:30,287 --> 00:10:32,454
Q has repaired your wristwatch.

60
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:35,541
And some background material
on San Monique.

61
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:36,875
Thank you, Moneypenny.

62
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:40,629
I'm sure the overburdened British
taxpayer will be fascinated to know

63
00:10:40,714 --> 00:10:43,674
how the Special Ordnance Section
disburses its funds.

64
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:46,427
In future, Commander,
allow me to suggest

65
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:49,972
a perfectly adequate watchmaker,
just down the street.

66
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:53,934
Good God.

67
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:56,395
You see, by pulling out this button, sir,

68
00:10:56,646 --> 00:10:59,732
it turns the watch into
a hyper-intensified magnetic field.

69
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,235
Powerful enough to even deflect
the path of a bullet

70
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,612
at long range, or so Q claims.

71
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:08,490
I feel very tempted
to test that theory right now.

72
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:12,202
If you don't mind, Commander, my spoon.

73
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,538
Oh, sorry, sir.

74
00:11:14,956 --> 00:11:16,081
Thank you.

75
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,167
Dr. Kananga is, at present, in New York.

76
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:22,504
The CIA have been informed, and
they're helping out with the surveillance.

77
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,506
Your flight arrives at 11:30 a. m.

78
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:26,592
Now, where did I leave my coat?

79
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:28,886
Oh, allow me.

80
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,104
Thank you.
Come along, Miss Moneypenny.

81
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:41,607
- Morning, Bond.
- Sir. Miss Moneypenny,

82
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:45,361
thank you.

83
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:46,987
Goodbye, James.

84
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:52,576
Or should I say ciao, bello.

85
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,736
Such a delicate touch.

86
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:30,572
Sheer magnetism, darling.

87
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:40,457
A man comes.

88
00:12:43,628 --> 00:12:46,088
He travels quickly.

89
00:12:49,676 --> 00:12:51,009
He has purpose.

90
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,179
He comes over water.

91
00:12:55,098 --> 00:12:56,640
He travels with others.

92
00:12:58,309 --> 00:12:59,518
He will oppose.

93
00:13:00,437 --> 00:13:02,521
He brings violence and destruction.

94
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:47,983
Hello. Mr. Leiter for you, sir.

95
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:51,987
Thank you. Hello, Felix. How are you?

96
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,616
Traffic permitting, I should be with you
in about half an hour.

97
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,910
Then you can buy me
the best lunch in New York.

98
00:13:58,828 --> 00:14:02,539
Fine, James.
Your friend Kananga has just left the UN.

99
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:04,625
He's probably headed back to his embassy.

100
00:14:05,126 --> 00:14:08,837
No, no, don't worry. I've got the place
eyeballed, wired for sound, the works.

101
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:11,757
Right. I'll see you in about a half hour.

102
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:08,647
Easy, Charlie. Let's get there in one piece.

103
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:12,150
Charlie?

104
00:15:55,987 --> 00:15:57,362
Right. Stand by.

105
00:15:58,197 --> 00:16:00,365
Here comes Kananga's limousine.

106
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:06,872
Out he gets

107
00:16:08,124 --> 00:16:09,750
with the usual goon squad

108
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:11,543
and the girl.

109
00:16:12,045 --> 00:16:13,211
Time, 11:46.

110
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:17,007
What is that?

111
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:24,473
Hello, Felix?
You know how I hate to trouble you,

112
00:16:24,557 --> 00:16:26,391
but I've run into a little bother.

113
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:31,313
You what?

114
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:37,069
Get me a make on a white pimpmobile.

115
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:41,823
347 Nelson-David-George.

116
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:45,494
It would seem, Dr. Kananga,
that the conference has not lived up

117
00:16:45,578 --> 00:16:46,745
to your prior expectations.

118
00:16:46,829 --> 00:16:49,706
Well, we can only hope
that this is a temporary setback.

119
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:52,584
However, I do have some observations
to make.

120
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:55,754
Take a letter, please.

121
00:16:57,423 --> 00:17:00,425
To Secretary-General,
Pan Island Unity Conference.

122
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:02,552
Sir.

123
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:10,143
I wish to point out that...

124
00:17:10,687 --> 00:17:12,604
...too many of our island neighbors

125
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:15,232
have once again let themselves be

126
00:17:15,942 --> 00:17:17,943
bullied by United States industry.

127
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:20,445
The story is an old one,

128
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:22,406
the record a clear one.

129
00:17:23,157 --> 00:17:26,326
Since my historic statement of principles

130
00:17:26,953 --> 00:17:29,830
was delivered and acted upon
some six months ago,

131
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,542
our economic outlook
has improved dramatically.

132
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:38,422
By exercising our policy of friendship
to all with favoritism towards none,

133
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:42,175
new respect for the entire area
has been engendered.

134
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:44,803
And even though
some of my most important...

135
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:48,890
James, that car is registered
to a shop at 33, East 65th Street.

136
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,476
That's only a block away from here. Right.

137
00:17:52,145 --> 00:17:55,480
Take your time, buddy.
Kananga's knitting a flag in there.

138
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:57,149
It might be the easiest thing to do.

139
00:18:22,508 --> 00:18:24,301
Something in heads?

140
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,846
Just browsing. Thank you.

141
00:18:52,872 --> 00:18:53,872
$5.

142
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:56,792
Do you think you could gift-wrap it
for me, please?

143
00:18:57,668 --> 00:18:59,336
Lengthwise, if you don't mind.

144
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:01,338
Thank you.

145
00:19:24,153 --> 00:19:26,029
...remains my first concern.

146
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:29,699
Thus, San Monique's future obligations
vis-à-vis her island neighbors

147
00:19:29,784 --> 00:19:30,867
would seem clear.

148
00:19:31,619 --> 00:19:34,746
Those who fawn and crawl
in the face of intimidation

149
00:19:34,914 --> 00:19:38,208
must perforce to look up
to those who stand proudly

150
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:40,627
wrapped in a justifiable self-confidence.

151
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:43,088
The time has come,

152
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:45,173
painful as it may be,

153
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,426
to gaze out among our sister nations
in the area

154
00:19:48,594 --> 00:19:50,220
and see if any stands tall...

155
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:45,442
He's tailing.

156
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:52,157
I got him in my sights.

157
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:09,507
- Hey, you know where you going, man?
- Uptown, I believe.

158
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:13,011
Uptown? You headed into Harlem, man.

159
00:21:13,095 --> 00:21:14,930
Well, you just keep on the tail
of that jukebox

160
00:21:15,014 --> 00:21:16,806
and there's an extra 20 in it for you.

161
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:19,059
Hey, man, for 20 bucks

162
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:21,937
I'll take you to a Ku Klux Klan cookout.

163
00:21:39,246 --> 00:21:42,082
125th, you got a honky on your tail.

164
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:58,181
He's heading east.

165
00:21:58,516 --> 00:22:00,892
Can't miss him.
It's like following a cue ball.

166
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,900
That's the car.
They must have gone inside.

167
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,986
Pull up where you can.

168
00:22:18,077 --> 00:22:19,995
Sure hope you make friends easy.

169
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:21,788
Right on, brother.

170
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:27,752
He's heading on in.

171
00:22:52,903 --> 00:22:56,072
Good afternoon.
Bourbon and water, please.

172
00:22:56,282 --> 00:22:57,532
First booth will do.

173
00:22:59,535 --> 00:23:01,536
- Tell him neat, would you?
- Huh?

174
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,788
- No ice.
- That's extra, man.

175
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:24,350
I'd like something on the side
as well, information.

176
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:26,895
Three men and a girl came in.

177
00:23:32,943 --> 00:23:34,486
Relax, baby.

178
00:23:35,237 --> 00:23:38,114
Mr. Big's gonna take care of you
in a minute.

179
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:02,889
Black queen on the red king, Miss...

180
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:06,976
- Solitaire.
- My name's Bond.

181
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:10,313
James Bond.

182
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:14,776
I know who you are, what you are
and why you've come.

183
00:24:15,778 --> 00:24:19,155
You have made a mistake.
You will not succeed.

184
00:24:20,574 --> 00:24:23,201
Rather a sweeping statement,
considering we've never met.

185
00:24:24,453 --> 00:24:26,079
The cards have followed you for me.

186
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,458
Now, you get ripped off in Detroit,
baby, you yell out to me, you hear?

187
00:24:36,048 --> 00:24:37,549
Is he armed?

188
00:24:39,718 --> 00:24:43,138
You can't be too careful
in New York City these days.

189
00:25:05,911 --> 00:25:08,830
Funny how the least little thing
amuses him.

190
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:17,005
Oh, fascinating.

191
00:25:17,756 --> 00:25:19,299
Well, that's you, quite obviously.

192
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:21,634
An amazing resemblance.

193
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:23,386
Tell me, am I in there as well?

194
00:25:25,097 --> 00:25:26,222
Pick a card.

195
00:25:30,394 --> 00:25:31,477
Turn it over.

196
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,774
You have found yourself.

197
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:41,487
I'm telling you,
you all go out there to LA and clean it up,

198
00:25:41,614 --> 00:25:44,407
or I'm coming out there and clean you up,
and I mean that!

199
00:25:45,868 --> 00:25:48,119
Is this the stupid mother
that tailed you uptown?

200
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:51,539
There seems to be some mistake.
My name is...

201
00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:53,291
Names is for tombstones, baby.

202
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,627
You all take this honky out
and waste him, now.

203
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:04,344
- "Waste him"? Is that a good thing?
- The reading is over.

204
00:26:04,803 --> 00:26:06,262
Nothing about my future?

205
00:26:15,731 --> 00:26:16,731
Us?

206
00:26:21,028 --> 00:26:24,155
Now, promise you'll stay right there.
I shan't be long.

207
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:35,416
Thank you.

208
00:26:53,727 --> 00:26:55,353
Keep your hands up, honky.

209
00:26:55,938 --> 00:26:58,898
What does he think this is?
I'll blow his frigging head off, man.

210
00:27:11,078 --> 00:27:12,328
Drop it!

211
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,418
Now.

212
00:27:27,177 --> 00:27:30,221
"Harold Strutter, CIA."
Where were you when I didn't need you?

213
00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:32,724
Kind of obvious
you weren't coming out front,

214
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:35,435
not even with that clever disguise
you're wearing.

215
00:27:36,145 --> 00:27:37,645
Whiteface in Harlem.

216
00:27:38,272 --> 00:27:41,024
Good thinking, Bond. Let's get out of here.

217
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:47,322
I'm surprised they didn't spot you, too.

218
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:50,408
There's a most remarkable girl
back there with a deck of cards.

219
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:54,787
I saw those cards on the way up.
Spades, James, every one.

220
00:27:55,247 --> 00:27:57,582
You were nailed the minute you left 74th.

221
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,584
There's only supposed to be one man
who can pull together

222
00:27:59,668 --> 00:28:01,377
that much black muscle in this town.

223
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:02,920
Calls himself Mr. Big.

224
00:28:03,422 --> 00:28:06,299
You name the business,
they say he has a black concession.

225
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:16,100
What would a foreign prime minister
like Kananga

226
00:28:16,185 --> 00:28:18,144
want with an American gangster?

227
00:28:18,354 --> 00:28:21,856
The question is, what would Mr. Big
want with a two-bit island diplomat?

228
00:28:22,107 --> 00:28:26,152
Mr. Big?
Where the hell does he fit into this mess?

229
00:28:30,657 --> 00:28:33,701
A genuine Felix lighter. Illuminating.

230
00:28:34,453 --> 00:28:35,453
Now, listen, James,

231
00:28:35,537 --> 00:28:38,081
we just found out
that Kananga's got a private plane

232
00:28:38,165 --> 00:28:40,708
and he's leaving for San Monique
within the hour.

233
00:28:40,793 --> 00:28:43,086
Then get me on the next available flight,
will you, Felix?

234
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,295
I already did.

235
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:48,383
I just knew you wouldn't pass up a chance
to get away from where the real action is.

236
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,146
The legendary Baron Samedi, folks.

237
00:29:02,231 --> 00:29:04,524
That's Saturday,
for those of you who speak French.

238
00:29:04,942 --> 00:29:08,611
Voodoo god of cemeteries
and chief of the legion of the dead.

239
00:29:08,695 --> 00:29:10,905
The man who cannot die.

240
00:29:10,989 --> 00:29:15,034
But for our purposes, just a performer
in a little musical extravaganza

241
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,954
we've cooked up for you wonderful people.

242
00:29:31,802 --> 00:29:34,595
Good evening. The name is Bond.
You have a reservation for me.

243
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,932
Yes, Mr. Bond, of course.
Mrs. Bond has been expecting you.

244
00:29:40,185 --> 00:29:43,354
- Mrs. Bond?
- She arrived earlier this afternoon, sir.

245
00:29:43,772 --> 00:29:46,858
Said she preferred
something a little more private.

246
00:29:47,526 --> 00:29:48,985
Bungalow 12.

247
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:51,529
An incurable romantic, Mrs. Bond.

248
00:31:45,644 --> 00:31:46,978
Room service, please.

249
00:31:51,483 --> 00:31:54,402
Room service?
This is Mr. Bond, bungalow 12.

250
00:31:54,486 --> 00:31:58,656
I'd like a bottle of Bollinger, please.
Slightly chilled.

251
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:03,578
Two glasses. Thank you.

252
00:33:14,566 --> 00:33:16,025
Anybody home?

253
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:25,409
Your champagne, sir.

254
00:33:26,036 --> 00:33:28,371
- What was that?
- Your champagne.

255
00:33:28,664 --> 00:33:30,206
Put it on the table. Thanks.

256
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:37,713
- Shall I open it?
- What?

257
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,757
Shall I open it?

258
00:33:41,343 --> 00:33:43,427
No. I can manage. Thank you.

259
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,932
- There you are.
- Thank you.

260
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:17,897
Mrs. Bond, I presume?

261
00:35:19,608 --> 00:35:20,858
I'm Rosie Carver.

262
00:35:24,988 --> 00:35:27,156
I guess I have a little explaining to do.

263
00:35:33,288 --> 00:35:35,581
Yes. Either you

264
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:38,375
or dear Uncle Felix.

265
00:35:40,545 --> 00:35:42,505
Custom. 38 Smith & Wesson.

266
00:35:43,173 --> 00:35:45,299
Corrugated 3-inch stock. No serial number.

267
00:35:45,383 --> 00:35:46,717
Standard CIA issue.

268
00:35:47,886 --> 00:35:50,888
Question is, why point it at me?

269
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,767
The man who delivered your champagne
is not a hotel waiter.

270
00:35:55,727 --> 00:35:57,394
I was just trying to be careful.

271
00:35:58,146 --> 00:36:00,231
As for Felix Leiter, you're right.

272
00:36:00,816 --> 00:36:03,734
I've worked for CIA down here
for some time now,

273
00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:07,571
and he cabled me you were coming
and asked if I wouldn't help out, if I could.

274
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:11,033
Perhaps you'd better start
by getting your head together.

275
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:15,913
- There's a mirror in the bathroom.
- Yes.

276
00:36:17,749 --> 00:36:19,917
You're only my second mission, you know.

277
00:36:20,418 --> 00:36:23,254
My first was Baines,
the agent who was killed.

278
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:28,259
It's a relief to know I'm next in line
for the same kind of aid.

279
00:36:35,851 --> 00:36:37,059
There's a...

280
00:36:37,143 --> 00:36:39,562
- There's a...
- A snake. I forgot. I should've told you.

281
00:36:39,646 --> 00:36:41,981
You should never go in there
without a mongoose.

282
00:36:42,065 --> 00:36:44,692
I should have never gotten into any of this.

283
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,736
I'm going to be completely useless to you.

284
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:51,156
I'm sure we'll be able
to lick you into shape.

285
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,619
It's getting late, Mrs. Bond.

286
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:58,122
Tomorrow is going to be
a very busy day for us.

287
00:36:58,206 --> 00:37:00,583
You see, Kananga is protecting something
down here,

288
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:01,750
something which

289
00:37:02,335 --> 00:37:03,961
Baines obviously discovered.

290
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,090
You're going to show me the spot
where Baines' body was found.

291
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:13,137
That, I'm afraid,
only leaves us tonight to, well,

292
00:37:13,638 --> 00:37:15,264
catch up on old times.

293
00:37:16,641 --> 00:37:18,976
Felix told me there'd be moments like this.

294
00:37:20,562 --> 00:37:23,147
What did good old Felix suggest?

295
00:37:24,482 --> 00:37:27,526
If all else failed, cyanide pills.

296
00:37:30,447 --> 00:37:32,323
I settled for two bedrooms.

297
00:37:35,577 --> 00:37:36,911
Good night, Mr. Bond.

298
00:37:37,996 --> 00:37:38,996
Mrs. Bond.

299
00:37:54,095 --> 00:37:57,181
Why, it's just a hat, darling,
belonging to a small-headed man

300
00:37:57,265 --> 00:37:59,308
of limited means
who lost a fight with a chicken.

301
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:02,061
It's a warning. Get it out of here!

302
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:05,689
Please.

303
00:38:06,566 --> 00:38:08,943
Please don't leave me alone tonight.

304
00:38:09,027 --> 00:38:12,112
James, please promise me.

305
00:38:14,824 --> 00:38:16,659
All right, darling, if you insist.

306
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:18,369
I promise.

307
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:25,876
I thank you.

308
00:38:27,337 --> 00:38:28,504
Rosie!

309
00:38:30,048 --> 00:38:31,173
Breakfast's up!

310
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:57,408
- Rosie, are you ready yet?
- What?

311
00:38:57,909 --> 00:39:00,369
I have to see about organizing a car.

312
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,621
I'll see you in the lobby.

313
00:39:17,012 --> 00:39:19,221
Over here, sir. Over here.
Guaranteed big fish.

314
00:39:19,305 --> 00:39:21,515
- Catch big fish, sir.
Hey, baby.

315
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:25,853
Over here. Bring your man over here.
Just $20. Half a day.

316
00:39:25,937 --> 00:39:28,605
You got warm lady.
We got cold beer over here, man.

317
00:39:28,732 --> 00:39:31,734
You wanna catch a big fish, sir?
It's only 2 pounds over here.

318
00:39:37,198 --> 00:39:38,240
Good morning.

319
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,118
Come on, Rosie.
This one seems eager enough.

320
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:52,379
Excuse me. Where can I change?

321
00:39:55,467 --> 00:39:58,427
Me. Clothes off. Where?

322
00:40:40,178 --> 00:40:42,096
Stop right there.

323
00:40:43,181 --> 00:40:44,848
Turn around slowly.

324
00:40:47,352 --> 00:40:48,852
Keep your hands up!

325
00:40:51,147 --> 00:40:53,148
As I was saying, Quarrel, a lousy agent.

326
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:55,567
But the compensations
speak for themselves.

327
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:59,404
Rosie Carver, meet the man
who shares my hairbrush,

328
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:00,989
Quarrel Junior.

329
00:41:02,242 --> 00:41:03,700
I'm really sorry.

330
00:41:04,035 --> 00:41:05,452
I could've shot you.

331
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:09,206
You might have even killed me
if you'd taken off the safety catch.

332
00:41:17,799 --> 00:41:19,049
Never mind, darling.

333
00:41:19,467 --> 00:41:22,803
You just let us know when we get
to the spot where Baines was killed.

334
00:41:25,223 --> 00:41:28,892
It's up in the hills
just after we clear the next cove.

335
00:41:40,697 --> 00:41:44,366
Hey, Quarrel, who the hell lives up there?

336
00:41:45,076 --> 00:41:47,202
That's the house of the Kananga woman.

337
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:49,454
She's supposed to have
the power of the obeah.

338
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:52,666
No one on the island
dare go up there except him.

339
00:42:00,341 --> 00:42:01,550
He comes again.

340
00:42:02,635 --> 00:42:03,969
There will be violence.

341
00:42:05,471 --> 00:42:06,805
He approaches even now.

342
00:42:07,807 --> 00:42:08,974
By land or water?

343
00:42:09,642 --> 00:42:10,726
Water.

344
00:42:20,945 --> 00:42:21,987
He has arrived.

345
00:42:23,198 --> 00:42:24,198
Good.

346
00:42:25,283 --> 00:42:27,951
Rosie's been more efficient
than I anticipated.

347
00:42:29,245 --> 00:42:31,622
I know a place
where we can rustle up a car.

348
00:42:32,123 --> 00:42:34,208
Beautiful, brave and now resourceful.

349
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,960
Rosie, you seem to be staging
a remarkable comeback.

350
00:42:39,464 --> 00:42:40,797
Tell me about the future.

351
00:42:55,146 --> 00:42:56,230
Is it death?

352
00:42:58,191 --> 00:42:59,775
I said, is it death?

353
00:43:00,652 --> 00:43:01,777
It is death.

354
00:43:06,866 --> 00:43:08,033
They're coming.

355
00:43:09,244 --> 00:43:10,661
Rosie knows what to do.

356
00:43:11,537 --> 00:43:14,164
Now, I want no bodies this time, no trace.

357
00:43:19,087 --> 00:43:20,587
It's down there.

358
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:25,842
But I thought you said Baines
was killed up in the hills, darling.

359
00:43:28,554 --> 00:43:30,389
Up in the hills down there.

360
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,269
Why don't we have
a bite of lunch and discuss it?

361
00:43:36,396 --> 00:43:38,563
There's an excellent patty in the hamper.

362
00:43:39,482 --> 00:43:41,024
I'm in no hurry.

363
00:43:41,859 --> 00:43:43,110
Are you?

364
00:43:45,446 --> 00:43:46,446
No.

365
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:15,559
James, you don't know
what finding you has meant to me.

366
00:44:15,935 --> 00:44:17,519
Oh, I can imagine.

367
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:20,731
And you've no idea
what finding this has meant to me.

368
00:44:22,066 --> 00:44:25,569
You do know what the Queen of Cups
means in an upside-down position?

369
00:44:25,987 --> 00:44:28,905
A deceitful, perverse woman,
a liar, a cheat.

370
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:30,699
And I'd like some answers now.

371
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:33,243
Please.

372
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,164
You don't understand, see.
They'll kill me if I do.

373
00:44:37,457 --> 00:44:39,166
And I'll kill you if you don't.

374
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:44,296
But you couldn't. You wouldn't.

375
00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:46,882
Not after what we've just done.

376
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:49,301
I certainly wouldn't have killed you before.

377
00:45:01,773 --> 00:45:05,484
It used to be a convincing act, Rosie.
It's wearing a little thin now.

378
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,862
It's not an act. It's...

379
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:11,031
Make your choice.

380
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:25,253
Rosie.

381
00:45:59,455 --> 00:46:01,289
You will explain what went wrong.

382
00:46:04,502 --> 00:46:06,420
I see the intervention of a woman.

383
00:46:07,213 --> 00:46:09,756
The girl was about to confess.
We had to kill her.

384
00:46:13,428 --> 00:46:14,594
The trap was set.

385
00:46:16,347 --> 00:46:17,514
Tee Hee was waiting.

386
00:46:20,351 --> 00:46:21,852
And you saw death.

387
00:46:22,353 --> 00:46:24,271
It must have been the girl's death.

388
00:46:25,773 --> 00:46:27,774
If you do not ask specific questions

389
00:46:28,693 --> 00:46:32,320
I cannot be responsible for
your misinterpretation of the answers.

390
00:46:35,366 --> 00:46:38,577
These growing signs of impertinence
begin to disturb me, Solitaire.

391
00:46:38,661 --> 00:46:40,996
Even as they did
with your mother before you.

392
00:46:41,372 --> 00:46:44,040
She had the power and lost it,
became useless to me.

393
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:46,710
You will not make the same mistake.

394
00:46:48,379 --> 00:46:49,379
Solitaire.

395
00:46:52,675 --> 00:47:19,409
Where is Bond now?

396
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:24,873
I cannot see
when you are this way with me.

397
00:47:27,084 --> 00:47:28,793
Things become unclear.

398
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,297
Let us hope these momentary lapses
do not become a habit.

399
00:47:33,174 --> 00:47:35,258
Your power exists to serve me,

400
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:37,177
and it is mine to control.

401
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:41,223
If and when the time comes
I decide you are to lose it,

402
00:47:41,307 --> 00:47:43,016
I myself will take it away.

403
00:47:49,482 --> 00:47:51,858
Solitaire, go to sleep.
You have made me angry with you,

404
00:47:52,109 --> 00:47:53,610
and I have no wish to be.

405
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,862
Tee Hee.

406
00:49:15,026 --> 00:49:16,526
Put down those cards.

407
00:49:20,197 --> 00:49:21,656
It is a blasphemy.

408
00:49:23,492 --> 00:49:25,535
They tell nothing to those who cannot see.

409
00:49:26,037 --> 00:49:28,830
But they do. That's a bit of luck.

410
00:49:29,415 --> 00:49:31,041
Good luck for both of us.

411
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:33,918
The cards say we will be lovers.

412
00:49:38,549 --> 00:49:39,674
You're mistaken.

413
00:49:40,968 --> 00:49:42,886
It's impossible, forbidden for me.

414
00:49:44,597 --> 00:49:45,972
Now you must go.

415
00:49:46,557 --> 00:49:48,391
But you do believe,

416
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:51,728
I mean really believe, in the cards.

417
00:49:54,231 --> 00:49:56,566
They have never lied to me.

418
00:49:57,318 --> 00:49:58,526
Then they won't now.

419
00:50:04,075 --> 00:50:05,116
Pick one.

420
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:35,271
You knew the answer before it was given.

421
00:50:38,818 --> 00:50:40,527
Strangely enough, somehow

422
00:50:41,779 --> 00:50:42,821
so did I.

423
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:19,816
So it's finally happened.

424
00:51:21,819 --> 00:51:23,486
Just as it did to my mother

425
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:25,822
and her mother before her.

426
00:51:28,534 --> 00:51:30,034
Well, of course it did.

427
00:51:31,495 --> 00:51:34,122
Well, you're visual proof of that,
aren't you?

428
00:51:38,586 --> 00:51:40,628
Come on. Cheer up, darling.

429
00:51:42,006 --> 00:51:44,048
Has to be a first time for everyone.

430
00:51:46,594 --> 00:51:49,512
Now, tell me, where's Kananga?

431
00:51:52,224 --> 00:51:53,975
I cannot see.

432
00:51:57,271 --> 00:51:59,689
- Oh, yes, the cards. I'll get them.
- No.

433
00:52:01,734 --> 00:52:03,568
There's no need to be frightened.

434
00:52:04,695 --> 00:52:06,821
You'll soon be rid of him, I promise.

435
00:52:08,616 --> 00:52:09,741
I promise.

436
00:52:11,952 --> 00:52:16,080
I just need a little bit of information,
that's all.

437
00:52:19,001 --> 00:52:20,502
The power,

438
00:52:22,254 --> 00:52:23,463
I've lost it.

439
00:52:26,884 --> 00:52:28,551
The high priestess

440
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,679
is wife to the prince,
no longer of this world.

441
00:52:33,557 --> 00:52:36,476
The spiritual bridge to the secret church.

442
00:52:39,396 --> 00:52:40,647
It's my fate.

443
00:52:42,024 --> 00:52:44,150
By compelling me to earthly love,

444
00:52:45,402 --> 00:52:47,904
the cards themselves
have taken away my powers.

445
00:52:51,325 --> 00:52:55,370
Darling, I have a small confession to make.

446
00:52:55,454 --> 00:52:57,497
Now, try not to be too upset.

447
00:52:59,834 --> 00:53:02,418
The deck was slightly stacked in my favor.

448
00:53:03,879 --> 00:53:05,255
It makes no difference.

449
00:53:06,257 --> 00:53:08,716
The physical violation cannot be undone.

450
00:53:11,595 --> 00:53:13,763
When he finds out I've lost my power,

451
00:53:15,766 --> 00:53:16,850
he'll kill me.

452
00:53:17,768 --> 00:53:19,936
Now, come on. He'll have to find you first.

453
00:53:21,063 --> 00:53:23,565
Lovers' lesson number one,
we have no secrets.

454
00:53:24,942 --> 00:53:27,151
For example, I have a boat waiting.

455
00:53:27,945 --> 00:53:29,445
You can be on it.

456
00:53:30,614 --> 00:53:32,782
All I have to know before we leave is

457
00:53:33,033 --> 00:53:35,451
what goes on back there in Voodooland.

458
00:53:39,373 --> 00:53:42,417
Darling, three men and a girl have been
killed in the last four days,

459
00:53:42,501 --> 00:53:45,336
not counting the number of times
they've tried to stop me from discovering

460
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:47,213
whatever Kananga's protecting.

461
00:53:47,965 --> 00:53:50,133
Now, do you want to be
on that boat or not?

462
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:52,927
I simply read the cards for him.

463
00:53:54,305 --> 00:53:57,682
I've never been there,
and he's never taken me there.

464
00:54:09,028 --> 00:54:10,361
I've never dared to go,

465
00:54:11,488 --> 00:54:12,906
but I've looked in the cards.

466
00:54:13,824 --> 00:54:15,575
I've seen great riches there.

467
00:54:17,995 --> 00:54:19,245
They'll kill you.

468
00:54:20,664 --> 00:54:21,873
Us, darling.

469
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:24,459
They will kill us.

470
00:54:25,169 --> 00:54:26,711
Lovers' lesson number two,

471
00:54:27,296 --> 00:54:31,132
togetherness till death do us part,
or thereabouts.

472
00:54:32,593 --> 00:54:34,177
Is there time before we leave

473
00:54:35,429 --> 00:54:36,888
for lesson number three?

474
00:54:43,062 --> 00:54:44,145
Absolutely.

475
00:54:44,688 --> 00:54:47,148
There's no sense in going off half-cocked.

476
00:55:01,789 --> 00:55:04,207
- This way.
- How can you be so sure?

477
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:08,044
Well, these scarecrows are to scare people
away. You're not scared, are you?

478
00:55:08,545 --> 00:55:10,797
Lesson number four,
follow the scarecrows.

479
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:48,876
- Good morning, boss.
- Good morning.

480
00:55:48,961 --> 00:55:51,546
It's sure gonna be a beautiful day.

481
00:55:53,799 --> 00:55:56,342
Yes, sir, a beautiful day.

482
00:56:08,272 --> 00:56:10,273
They're heading for the hill.

483
00:56:13,736 --> 00:56:14,986
They're here.

484
00:56:18,824 --> 00:56:20,283
If he finds it, kill him.

485
00:57:25,557 --> 00:57:26,849
Quick!

486
00:57:37,986 --> 00:57:40,363
We've lost him. He has the girl.

487
00:57:51,416 --> 00:57:53,292
They're somewhere under the nets.

488
00:58:00,008 --> 00:58:01,509
At any cost, any.

489
00:58:01,885 --> 00:58:03,219
Bond must die.

490
00:58:24,116 --> 00:58:26,075
Unit two-five, we have picked them up.

491
00:58:35,294 --> 00:58:37,753
Base to two-five. Arrest Bond.

492
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:40,423
But, I repeat, the girl is not to be touched.

493
00:58:40,841 --> 00:58:43,259
Message received and understood.
Over and out.

494
00:58:44,136 --> 00:58:45,428
Base to all units.

495
00:58:45,846 --> 00:58:48,222
I repeat, the girl is not to be touched.

496
01:01:25,422 --> 01:01:27,340
Sweet mother of pearl.

497
01:01:27,424 --> 01:01:29,091
All change. End of the line.

498
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:32,094
Get down below quickly.

499
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,263
Here. I'll do that. You get us started.

500
01:01:43,357 --> 01:01:44,940
It appears a bust.

501
01:01:52,491 --> 01:01:53,616
James.

502
01:01:54,951 --> 01:01:57,995
He'll be looking for me now.
I know he'll never stop.

503
01:01:58,121 --> 01:01:59,497
Come on, darling.

504
01:02:00,332 --> 01:02:01,499
It's all over.

505
01:02:04,711 --> 01:02:07,171
Voodooland was just poppy fields.

506
01:02:07,798 --> 01:02:09,757
A simple matter of heroin smuggling.

507
01:02:10,675 --> 01:02:13,886
I'll have a word or two with a man named
Felix and turn the entire case over to him.

508
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:18,057
And you and I will be off.
By the way, where would you like to go?

509
01:02:20,018 --> 01:02:22,186
Anywhere where we can find one of these.

510
01:02:34,074 --> 01:02:35,741
How quickly can we
make it to New Orleans?

511
01:02:35,826 --> 01:02:38,244
Santa Mina, four hours away.

512
01:02:38,745 --> 01:02:41,163
You can catch a flight
and be there in the morning.

513
01:02:41,248 --> 01:02:43,082
Then get in touch with Felix
on the scrambler.

514
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:46,210
Tell him to meet me there tomorrow.
Royal Orleans Hotel.

515
01:02:46,336 --> 01:02:48,003
Tampa is closer.

516
01:02:48,672 --> 01:02:52,258
Hamilton was killed in New Orleans,
so there has to be a connection.

517
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:56,679
And this is a valuable
piece of merchandise we are carrying,

518
01:02:56,888 --> 01:02:58,931
which with any luck, they'll want back.

519
01:03:13,488 --> 01:03:15,197
Royal Orleans Hotel, please.

520
01:03:29,713 --> 01:03:31,589
Are you sure this is
the way to New Orleans?

521
01:03:31,673 --> 01:03:35,551
I don't know, but it sure beats
the hell out of Harlem, don't it?

522
01:03:41,183 --> 01:03:45,561
Well, hello, Jim. What's happening, baby?

523
01:03:47,981 --> 01:03:51,901
Just ease back now, Jim. Relax.

524
01:03:52,152 --> 01:03:54,111
Mr. Big wants to see you.

525
01:04:20,013 --> 01:04:22,223
You made a mistake back
on that island, Bond.

526
01:04:22,474 --> 01:04:24,183
You took something that
didn't belong to you,

527
01:04:24,434 --> 01:04:26,894
and you took it from a friend of Mr. Big's.

528
01:04:27,103 --> 01:04:30,231
That type of mistake is
tough to bounce back from.

529
01:04:33,568 --> 01:04:36,695
- But I've only just arrived.
- Today is your lucky day, Jim.

530
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:38,447
You're going skydiving.

531
01:04:38,949 --> 01:04:41,659
There's a hell of a view of
the lake from 10,000 feet.

532
01:04:42,077 --> 01:04:44,703
My only regret is I won't be there to see it.

533
01:05:09,854 --> 01:05:12,398
- Good morning. You're...
- Mrs. Bell. You're not my instructor.

534
01:05:12,482 --> 01:05:17,069
- Where's Mr. Bleeker?
- Indisposed. I'll be giving the lesson.

535
01:05:18,947 --> 01:05:20,614
Come on, come on!

536
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:25,995
What's on for today?

537
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,414
Well, let's just wing it, shall we, Mrs. Bell?

538
01:06:01,281 --> 01:06:02,865
You're over-revving.

539
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:11,415
Leroy, slow down!
For Pete's sake, slow down!

540
01:06:11,499 --> 01:06:14,418
Do what the man say!
I can't find the brake!

541
01:06:26,097 --> 01:06:27,890
Close those doors!

542
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,603
Holy shit.

543
01:06:40,904 --> 01:06:42,821
Look out! Look out!

544
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:53,666
Okay, Don. Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

545
01:06:53,917 --> 01:06:57,836
Right. Talk to you later.
I gotta go and give a lesson.

546
01:07:03,009 --> 01:07:04,718
Same time tomorrow, Mrs. Bell?

547
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:08,472
Yes, Mr. Bleeker.

548
01:07:08,848 --> 01:07:13,310
Yes, sir. Well, I know you just
can't glue the wings back on.

549
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:16,480
Now, Mr. Bleeker, I'm sure
there's no reason for name-calling.

550
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:18,232
No, that's fine.

551
01:07:18,316 --> 01:07:19,608
- You can fit the rest this afternoon.
- Right, sir.

552
01:07:19,693 --> 01:07:20,859
Don't forget the double vents.

553
01:07:20,944 --> 01:07:22,778
I appreciate she may be
one of your best pupils, yes.

554
01:07:22,862 --> 01:07:25,531
That'll do nicely. That's a little frantic.
I'll keep the other three.

555
01:07:25,615 --> 01:07:27,700
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Bleeker, any suggestion of that kind

556
01:07:27,784 --> 01:07:29,868
should be forwarded in writing
to Washington.

557
01:07:29,953 --> 01:07:33,455
- How is Mrs. Bell?
- Intensive care. But she'll pull through.

558
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:36,583
Yes, sir. Oh, no, sir, no one's
questioning your patriotism.

559
01:07:36,668 --> 01:07:38,544
I'm sure you're a veteran, sir.

560
01:07:39,421 --> 01:07:42,506
Felix, you might find out if there's
a Fillet of Soul restaurant in town.

561
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:44,049
James, we're way ahead of you.

562
01:07:44,134 --> 01:07:46,760
It's on Docker Street.
Strutter's watching it now.

563
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:52,409
Hell of a send-off.

564
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:54,411
This way.

565
01:09:11,387 --> 01:09:14,139
- Where's Strutter?
- He's gotta be inside somewhere.

566
01:09:18,603 --> 01:09:19,978
Two, gentlemen?

567
01:09:22,273 --> 01:09:24,900
I got a nice booth over here
just against the wall.

568
01:09:26,402 --> 01:09:29,738
Do you think you could find something
a little closer to the stage?

569
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:33,534
- What's wrong with a booth?
- I once had a nasty turn in a booth.

570
01:09:41,668 --> 01:09:44,461
- Bourbon. No ice, please.
- Two Sazeracs.

571
01:09:44,838 --> 01:09:48,173
Where's your sense of adventure, James?
This is New Orleans. Relax.

572
01:09:48,758 --> 01:09:50,509
When you were young

573
01:09:50,593 --> 01:09:53,387
And your heart was an open book

574
01:09:54,264 --> 01:09:58,725
You used to say live and let live

575
01:10:00,228 --> 01:10:02,813
- One of you guys called Felix Leiter?
- Yeah. Right here.

576
01:10:02,897 --> 01:10:04,857
Telephone call for you. Guy called Strutter.

577
01:10:04,941 --> 01:10:08,402
Thanks. For a minute there, I thought
Harry was laying down on the job.

578
01:10:10,905 --> 01:10:26,253
Say live and let die

579
01:10:31,634 --> 01:10:34,303
What does it matter to ya?

580
01:10:34,637 --> 01:10:37,848
When you got a job to do,
you got to do it well

581
01:10:39,183 --> 01:10:42,144
You got to give the other fellow hell

582
01:10:42,645 --> 01:10:44,146
What happened to my...

583
01:10:45,148 --> 01:10:47,399
- What happened to my friend?
- What happened to your friend? Listen...

584
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,695
Thanks for dropping in, baby.

585
01:10:53,323 --> 01:10:55,657
Yeah, you one tough pig to nail down.

586
01:10:57,076 --> 01:10:59,661
You've been picking at me
like some kind of maggot.

587
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:03,373
First, you go up to Harlem
and kill one of the brothers.

588
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:05,125
That disturbed me.

589
01:11:06,628 --> 01:11:09,087
Well, then you go and steal
this valuable young lady

590
01:11:09,172 --> 01:11:11,006
from my good friend, Dr. Kananga.

591
01:11:12,216 --> 01:11:17,012
Now, old Kananga, he believes in all
that card crap. I mean, he's mad.

592
01:11:18,306 --> 01:11:20,766
Well, possession being
nine points of the law,

593
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:23,769
I would say Kananga is your problem now.
Thank you.

594
01:11:25,813 --> 01:11:29,524
In fact, if I were you,
I'd watch my step from now on.

595
01:11:31,235 --> 01:11:34,196
Yeah, well, you just let me handle
our business with the man.

596
01:11:39,577 --> 01:11:42,162
I've got my own plans for you, baby.

597
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:45,749
But first,

598
01:11:46,709 --> 01:11:51,088
there's one little question
that he wants answers for.

599
01:11:51,172 --> 01:11:54,716
In that case, you'd better ship me back
to the island and let him ask in person.

600
01:11:55,259 --> 01:11:58,303
I'm not in the habit of
giving answers to lackeys.

601
01:11:58,721 --> 01:12:01,598
You damn lucky you got a ear left
to hear the question with.

602
01:12:02,308 --> 01:12:03,350
Which is,

603
01:12:04,143 --> 01:12:05,769
did you mess with that?

604
01:12:10,608 --> 01:12:15,153
That's between Solitaire and myself and
Kananga. I'll tell him when I see him.

605
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:17,739
You ain't gonna see the sunlight
unless you answer me!

606
01:12:17,907 --> 01:12:19,950
I had no idea
you were so frightened of him.

607
01:12:20,034 --> 01:12:24,663
- Did you touch her?
- When I see Kananga.

608
01:12:25,665 --> 01:12:26,915
Right.

609
01:12:48,604 --> 01:12:50,022
Quite revealing.

610
01:12:53,276 --> 01:12:58,071
Kananga, poppy grower in thousands
of acres of well-camouflaged fields

611
01:12:58,156 --> 01:13:00,782
protected by the voodoo threat
of Baron Samedi.

612
01:13:03,077 --> 01:13:06,204
And as Mr. Big, distributor and wholesaler

613
01:13:06,289 --> 01:13:08,582
through a chain of
Fillet of Soul restaurants.

614
01:13:09,042 --> 01:13:10,333
Wholesale?

615
01:13:12,628 --> 01:13:14,421
Sell heroin for money?

616
01:13:14,756 --> 01:13:17,507
My apologies.
I'm sure you simply give it away.

617
01:13:18,342 --> 01:13:19,634
Excellent, Mr. Bond.

618
01:13:21,012 --> 01:13:23,055
That's precisely what I intend to do.

619
01:13:24,057 --> 01:13:25,515
Two tons of it to be exact.

620
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:28,810
When entering
into a fiercely competitive field,

621
01:13:28,895 --> 01:13:31,438
one finds it advisable
to give away free samples.

622
01:13:31,898 --> 01:13:34,357
Man or woman, black or white.
I don't discriminate.

623
01:13:36,819 --> 01:13:40,572
Two tons of heroin with a street value
well over a billion dollars,

624
01:13:40,823 --> 01:13:43,116
nationally distributed free?

625
01:13:44,535 --> 01:13:48,830
That should make a certain group of
families rather angry, wouldn't you say?

626
01:13:49,248 --> 01:13:50,290
Angry?

627
01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:52,626
Why, my dear Mr. Bond,

628
01:13:53,336 --> 01:13:56,129
it'll positively drive them
out of their minds

629
01:13:56,214 --> 01:13:58,423
and, subsequently, out of the business.

630
01:13:58,508 --> 01:14:02,260
Quite ingenious.
A sort of junkie's welfare system.

631
01:14:02,345 --> 01:14:04,930
Well, merely until the number
of addicts in the country

632
01:14:05,014 --> 01:14:06,473
has doubled, shall we say.

633
01:14:07,183 --> 01:14:10,977
Then I will begin to market that acreage
that you blundered into the other day.

634
01:14:11,062 --> 01:14:16,149
That heroin will be very expensive indeed,
leaving myself and the phone company

635
01:14:16,234 --> 01:14:19,986
the only two going monopolies
in this nation for years to come.

636
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:24,199
And here I thought it was Solitaire
did the fortunetelling.

637
01:14:25,076 --> 01:14:27,536
Let's hope for both of your sakes
she still can.

638
01:14:29,997 --> 01:14:33,834
The question still stands, Mr. Bond,
asked by the gentleman concerned.

639
01:14:36,045 --> 01:14:37,546
Did you touch her?

640
01:14:38,506 --> 01:14:41,716
Why, it's not the sort of question
a gentleman answers.

641
01:14:43,427 --> 01:14:45,804
Well, having set the example,

642
01:14:46,013 --> 01:14:48,890
I don't expect Miss Solitaire
to be any less the lady.

643
01:14:55,773 --> 01:14:56,815
By the way,

644
01:14:57,650 --> 01:15:00,735
that's a particularly handsome
watch you're wearing, Mr. Bond.

645
01:15:01,904 --> 01:15:05,031
- May I see it, please?
- You'll forgive me if I don't get up.

646
01:15:08,578 --> 01:15:09,828
Butterhook.

647
01:15:22,592 --> 01:15:23,758
Tee Hee,

648
01:15:25,344 --> 01:15:30,056
on the first wrong answer
from Miss Solitaire,

649
01:15:30,141 --> 01:15:33,101
you will snip the little finger
of Mr. Bond's right hand.

650
01:15:40,359 --> 01:15:42,611
Starting with the second wrong answer,

651
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:47,115
you'll proceed to the more vital areas.

652
01:15:51,537 --> 01:15:54,414
Solitaire, my dear,

653
01:15:55,291 --> 01:15:58,251
I want you to listen to me very carefully.

654
01:16:02,256 --> 01:16:06,676
On the back of Mr. Bond's watch,
the registration number

655
01:16:06,761 --> 01:16:11,932
3-2-6-6.

656
01:16:18,856 --> 01:16:20,232
Do I speak the truth?

657
01:16:36,499 --> 01:16:37,832
You speak the truth.

658
01:16:57,395 --> 01:16:58,561
Well.

659
01:17:01,274 --> 01:17:04,192
If nothing else, at least
I have laid your fears to rest.

660
01:17:05,152 --> 01:17:07,570
My compliments on a splendid operation.

661
01:17:07,697 --> 01:17:09,698
There is one thing, however, the...

662
01:17:18,249 --> 01:17:20,875
Whisper, take him to the farm.

663
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:52,115
When do we start back?

664
01:17:59,332 --> 01:18:01,958
Soon, Solitaire, soon.

665
01:18:15,681 --> 01:18:16,931
Solitaire, why?

666
01:18:17,975 --> 01:18:20,101
I treated you well. You lacked for nothing.

667
01:18:23,481 --> 01:18:27,817
- I don't understand what you...
- Mr. Bond's watch, my dear.

668
01:18:28,944 --> 01:18:33,198
I gave you every break possible.
You had a 50-50 chance.

669
01:18:34,492 --> 01:18:36,159
You weren't even close.

670
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,454
I had no choice.

671
01:18:41,457 --> 01:18:43,625
Please believe me. The cards.

672
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,023
When the time came,
I myself would have given you love.

673
01:19:08,776 --> 01:19:12,195
You knew that. You knew that!

674
01:19:15,366 --> 01:19:18,076
There's only one proper way
to deal with this.

675
01:19:22,915 --> 01:19:24,332
And one proper time.

676
01:20:33,861 --> 01:20:35,862
The tonnage order is nearly complete.

677
01:20:40,743 --> 01:20:42,076
We move it out tonight.

678
01:20:45,915 --> 01:20:47,207
And I mean tonight.

679
01:20:48,709 --> 01:20:49,751
Mr. Bond.

680
01:21:01,847 --> 01:21:04,349
How much do you know
about crocodiles, Bond?

681
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:08,186
Oh, I've always tried to keep them
at arm's length, myself.

682
01:21:10,397 --> 01:21:12,065
Cute little nippers, ain't they?

683
01:21:13,025 --> 01:21:16,236
I don't suppose those potential
overnight bags are orphans?

684
01:21:16,445 --> 01:21:18,696
Oh, no.
We have some moms and dads, as well.

685
01:21:24,286 --> 01:21:27,163
In fact, quite a few thousand.

686
01:21:39,927 --> 01:21:43,054
This is the part I like best, feeding time.

687
01:21:43,305 --> 01:21:45,974
I suspect the highlight of the tour.

688
01:22:05,119 --> 01:22:07,704
Some of these babies
live to be 200 years old.

689
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,085
Look over there.

690
01:22:15,504 --> 01:22:18,965
That's an alligator.
You can always tell by its round nose.

691
01:22:22,845 --> 01:22:24,262
There's old Albert.

692
01:22:24,471 --> 01:22:25,597
He's a croc.

693
01:22:26,265 --> 01:22:30,226
Got over-careless with him sometime
back and he took my whole arm off.

694
01:22:31,186 --> 01:22:35,815
- Well done, Albert.
- They'll eat anything, even each other.

695
01:22:37,401 --> 01:22:40,403
Then again, sometime they can go
a whole year without eating.

696
01:22:42,948 --> 01:22:44,574
Oh, I was rather counting on that.

697
01:22:44,658 --> 01:22:47,410
There are two ways
to disable a crocodile, you know.

698
01:22:52,958 --> 01:22:56,669
I don't suppose you care
to share that information with me?

699
01:22:56,754 --> 01:23:01,132
One way is to take a pencil and jam it
in the depression hole behind his eyes.

700
01:23:01,383 --> 01:23:02,508
And the other?

701
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:05,053
Oh, the other is twice as simple.

702
01:23:07,056 --> 01:23:09,349
You just put your hand in his mouth

703
01:23:09,433 --> 01:23:10,933
and pull his teeth out.

704
01:25:56,558 --> 01:25:58,392
It's on fire!

705
01:26:06,235 --> 01:26:07,819
Adam, get him!

706
01:26:07,903 --> 01:26:11,447
Adam, get the car! Cut him off!
Hector, move, damn it!

707
01:26:26,088 --> 01:26:30,341
Bond ripped off one of our boats!
He's headed for the Irish Bayou.

708
01:26:30,425 --> 01:26:32,635
The man that gets him stays alive.

709
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:34,595
Now, move, you mother...

710
01:27:42,164 --> 01:27:43,331
Toby!

711
01:27:44,333 --> 01:27:48,586
Toby, I got me a regular
Ben-Hur down here

712
01:27:48,962 --> 01:27:51,589
doing 95 minimum.

713
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:55,343
- Need any help, J.W.?
- Hell, no!

714
01:28:33,674 --> 01:28:36,384
You got a set of wheels
that just won't quit, boy.

715
01:28:36,802 --> 01:28:39,178
If they're yours, that is.

716
01:28:39,554 --> 01:28:43,641
You spin around, boy.
Ten fingers on the fender.

717
01:28:47,646 --> 01:28:49,063
Legs apart.

718
01:28:51,733 --> 01:28:55,861
I'm sure this ain't exactly
your debut with this sort of thing.

719
01:28:57,906 --> 01:29:01,867
You picked the wrong parish
to haul ass through, boy.

720
01:29:02,577 --> 01:29:06,247
Nobody cuts and runs
on Sheriff J.W. Pepper.

721
01:29:07,249 --> 01:29:10,167
And it's him speaking, by the by.

722
01:29:17,467 --> 01:29:19,010
What the...

723
01:29:48,457 --> 01:29:52,126
J.W., soon as you nail
that offending vehicle,

724
01:29:52,627 --> 01:29:54,545
Miss Pearson just called.

725
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:57,923
Seems her dog's foaming all at the mouth.

726
01:29:58,759 --> 01:30:00,676
She's got him locked up in her shed,

727
01:30:01,011 --> 01:30:04,180
wondering if you'd like to come over
and shoot it for her.

728
01:30:07,642 --> 01:30:10,144
You tell Miss Pearson take a flying...

729
01:30:12,689 --> 01:30:15,983
That look like a boat stuck
in the sheriff's car there, Eddie?

730
01:30:16,068 --> 01:30:19,737
Boy, where you been all your life?
That there's one of them new car-boats.

731
01:30:20,155 --> 01:30:24,450
By the powers invested in me
by this parish

732
01:30:25,368 --> 01:30:28,454
I hereby do commandeer this vehicle

733
01:30:28,538 --> 01:30:30,706
and all those persons within.

734
01:30:33,335 --> 01:30:36,462
And that means you, smartass.

735
01:31:58,086 --> 01:31:59,795
Unit 23 in position.

736
01:32:00,213 --> 01:32:02,423
Ten-four, 23. Come in, 28.

737
01:32:02,632 --> 01:32:05,342
Hey, J.W., seems like Deke Rogers

738
01:32:05,427 --> 01:32:07,636
done got his boat stole off the river.

739
01:32:07,804 --> 01:32:09,847
But picked up a new one
in his swimming pool.

740
01:32:09,931 --> 01:32:12,516
Sheriff, you want
to get your boys off our frequency?

741
01:32:12,601 --> 01:32:15,895
Give me that!
Now you listen to me, trooper boy!

742
01:32:15,979 --> 01:32:18,647
We got a swamp full of black Russians

743
01:32:18,899 --> 01:32:21,859
driving boats to beat the dam down here!

744
01:32:21,943 --> 01:32:25,404
Relax, Sheriff. We've got a roadblock
waiting for them at Miller's Bridge.

745
01:32:27,782 --> 01:32:31,702
Unit 26 at Miller's Bridge.
We're just about all set here.

746
01:32:31,786 --> 01:32:34,038
Make that secure there, you hear?

747
01:32:37,876 --> 01:32:40,044
Okay, fellas, here they come.

748
01:32:54,559 --> 01:32:57,269
All right, out of my way!
I'm in charge here!

749
01:32:57,354 --> 01:32:58,854
You two boys, come on!

750
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:07,279
I don't want excuses, trooper.
I want those two men and their boats

751
01:33:07,364 --> 01:33:10,157
- apprehended immediately, did you hear?
- Yes, sir, Captain.

752
01:33:10,492 --> 01:33:12,826
I understand. But I don't know right off

753
01:33:12,911 --> 01:33:15,079
where we're going to find
a boat fast enough to catch them.

754
01:33:15,163 --> 01:33:17,623
I got it.
You call my brother-in-law Billy Bob.

755
01:33:17,707 --> 01:33:21,085
He got the fastest boat
on the whole damn river.

756
01:33:21,169 --> 01:33:25,506
Billy Bob will sure enough fix
their ass, huh? Yeah, call Billy Bob.

757
01:33:31,846 --> 01:33:33,931
Now, there's two boats, Billy Bob,

758
01:33:34,015 --> 01:33:36,183
and they're moving like buttered pigs.

759
01:33:36,434 --> 01:33:38,936
Now, I promised these boys here
you would get them.

760
01:33:39,020 --> 01:33:42,398
- Don't let me down, hear?
- Cool down, J.W. I'm on my way.

761
01:33:43,692 --> 01:33:47,486
- You want something, boy?
- Yes, I'd like to borrow this boat, if I may.

762
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:50,072
Everybody on the river
would like to borrow this boat.

763
01:33:53,034 --> 01:33:55,828
Billy Bob, we got them spotted.

764
01:33:55,912 --> 01:33:58,664
They're headed for Haley's Landing.

765
01:34:12,762 --> 01:34:15,431
That's my brother-in-law! That's Billy Bob!

766
01:34:15,515 --> 01:34:17,474
He'll get them. Billy Bob'll get them.

767
01:34:19,686 --> 01:34:21,061
Hot damn!

768
01:34:21,146 --> 01:34:24,690
If one side of the Pepper family
don't get them, the other side will.

769
01:34:24,774 --> 01:34:25,816
Let's go!

770
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,459
If any man can show just cause

771
01:35:26,044 --> 01:35:28,087
why they may not
lawfully be joined together

772
01:35:28,171 --> 01:35:30,464
let him now speak, or else hereafter...

773
01:35:54,572 --> 01:35:57,032
Headquarters to all units, suspects seen

774
01:35:57,117 --> 01:36:00,077
proceeding down via Liberty
towards Highway 11.

775
01:36:00,203 --> 01:36:01,578
Proceed with caution.

776
01:36:05,166 --> 01:36:07,835
Would you get that
chicken coop off the road?

777
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:13,465
Did you ever think of getting
a driver's license, boy?

778
01:37:04,392 --> 01:37:07,102
Are you sure that was
your brother-in-law, Sheriff?

779
01:39:21,154 --> 01:39:24,156
- Hello, Felix. What are you doing here?
- We'll get to that later.

780
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:27,034
Kananga's in town. He's got
your girl with him. They just took off.

781
01:39:30,872 --> 01:39:33,206
There's the son of a bitch!
I got him!

782
01:39:37,712 --> 01:39:39,254
What are you?

783
01:39:39,547 --> 01:39:43,008
Some kind of doomsday machine, boy?

784
01:39:43,426 --> 01:39:47,554
Well, we got a cage strong enough
to hold an animal like you here.

785
01:39:47,639 --> 01:39:50,015
Captain, would you enlighten
the sheriff please?

786
01:39:50,099 --> 01:39:51,141
Yes, sir.

787
01:39:51,225 --> 01:39:53,352
J.W., let me have a word with you.

788
01:39:54,687 --> 01:39:57,814
J.W., now, this fella's
from London, England.

789
01:39:57,899 --> 01:40:01,151
He's an Englishman working
in cooperation with our boys,

790
01:40:01,235 --> 01:40:02,694
a sort of secret agent.

791
01:40:02,779 --> 01:40:04,780
Secret agent?

792
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:07,866
On whose side?

793
01:40:08,242 --> 01:40:10,202
We busted the Fillet of Soul an hour ago.

794
01:40:10,286 --> 01:40:12,287
We came up with nothing but these.

795
01:40:14,082 --> 01:40:16,249
Kananga's clear. You should have seen

796
01:40:16,334 --> 01:40:18,251
the size of the guy
who got on the boat with him.

797
01:40:18,336 --> 01:40:20,128
Nine feet tall, I swear.

798
01:40:20,463 --> 01:40:24,675
Big top hat, a cockamamie flute in
one hand and Solitaire in the other.

799
01:40:55,164 --> 01:40:57,457
The incendiary bombs
are set for midnight.

800
01:40:58,126 --> 01:41:01,753
Now, that gives you exactly 30 minutes.

801
01:41:04,048 --> 01:41:06,299
Watch out for sharks on the way back.

802
01:41:06,384 --> 01:41:09,886
- I'll see you for breakfast, Felix.
- Good hunting.

803
01:41:27,405 --> 01:41:30,407
You're going to need these
and the shark gun on the way back.

804
01:41:33,327 --> 01:41:37,164
- Seems like the party's started.
- My regards to Baron Samedi, man,

805
01:41:37,248 --> 01:41:38,957
right between the eyes.

806
01:48:02,049 --> 01:48:03,049
Trouble!

807
01:49:07,406 --> 01:49:11,743
Ah, Mr. Bond, there you are!
And Miss Solitaire, as well.

808
01:49:11,827 --> 01:49:13,953
Hardly unexpected, but most welcome.

809
01:49:14,455 --> 01:49:15,788
Whisper!

810
01:49:16,248 --> 01:49:18,166
Two more glasses for our guests!

811
01:49:19,376 --> 01:49:23,296
- What shall we drink to, Mr. Bond?
- Well, how about an earthquake?

812
01:49:33,641 --> 01:49:35,141
Welcome home!

813
01:49:35,226 --> 01:49:37,602
- Where's our boy?
- He'll be along anytime now.

814
01:49:37,811 --> 01:49:40,188
I checked behind a rock,
and his wet suit is gone.

815
01:49:42,149 --> 01:49:43,233
Keep the change.

816
01:49:47,696 --> 01:49:49,864
It's unfortunate that
your wet suit was discovered

817
01:49:49,949 --> 01:49:51,824
only minutes before
the field was destroyed.

818
01:49:52,201 --> 01:49:57,038
- Don't tell me you're not insured.
- No. The poppy's a very sturdy flower.

819
01:49:57,331 --> 01:50:00,708
You have been a relatively minor nuisance,
in fact.

820
01:50:00,834 --> 01:50:02,168
But this gun...

821
01:50:02,836 --> 01:50:06,005
I find it particularly fascinating. What is it?

822
01:50:07,383 --> 01:50:11,094
A shark gun, naturally,
with compressed gas pellets.

823
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:36,369
Ingenious!

824
01:50:36,787 --> 01:50:39,247
Don't pull the pin out.

825
01:50:39,665 --> 01:50:41,833
The air in here is foul enough already.

826
01:50:43,585 --> 01:50:46,629
Somehow I never thought of you
as a poor loser.

827
01:50:46,714 --> 01:50:49,257
I was hoping you would join me
to a drink to the future.

828
01:50:49,341 --> 01:50:51,592
Oh, Miss Solitaire used to
know all about the future.

829
01:50:51,677 --> 01:50:54,262
She was especially good
at predicting death.

830
01:50:58,475 --> 01:51:00,059
An underground monorail.

831
01:51:01,687 --> 01:51:04,355
Connected to the last refuge
of a scoundrel, no doubt.

832
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:10,278
The heroin leaves here, I take it,
carried somewhere by that winch.

833
01:51:10,654 --> 01:51:13,281
Correct again, Mr. Bond.
What a quick study you are.

834
01:51:13,782 --> 01:51:15,450
Let me show you exactly how it works.

835
01:51:16,368 --> 01:51:19,078
- Where in hell can the man be?
- Relax.

836
01:51:19,163 --> 01:51:21,039
He must have got tied up somewhere.

837
01:51:22,458 --> 01:51:24,959
These cans hold 25 pounds each.

838
01:51:25,919 --> 01:51:29,339
There are 20 cans to a shipment,
packed in watertight...

839
01:51:31,508 --> 01:51:32,842
Metal containers.

840
01:51:33,761 --> 01:51:35,178
It's your show, Kananga,

841
01:51:35,262 --> 01:51:38,181
but I'm sure there must be a simpler way
of drowning someone.

842
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:43,853
Drown, Mr. Bond?
I doubt you'll get the chance to drown.

843
01:52:21,141 --> 01:52:23,476
Perhaps we could try something
in an even simpler vein.

844
01:52:23,769 --> 01:52:25,645
On the contrary, Mr. Bond.

845
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:28,815
I think you'll find those wounds quite fatal.

846
01:53:13,861 --> 01:53:14,902
Whisper.

847
01:53:17,114 --> 01:53:18,197
The gate.

848
01:53:21,577 --> 01:53:24,412
Oh, slowly, Whisper! Slowly, slowly.

849
01:53:24,580 --> 01:53:26,706
Let our diners assemble.

850
01:54:14,046 --> 01:54:15,213
Look out!

851
01:55:14,815 --> 01:55:16,023
Where's Kananga?

852
01:55:16,108 --> 01:55:19,151
Well, he always did have
an inflated opinion of himself.

853
01:55:24,908 --> 01:55:25,908
Oh, James,

854
01:55:27,411 --> 01:55:29,161
how do we get out of here?

855
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:31,747
We take the train, of course.

856
01:55:34,084 --> 01:55:35,876
Well, thanks for everything, Felix.

857
01:55:35,961 --> 01:55:38,087
I'll see you tomorrow night at the 21 Club,
and don't be late.

858
01:55:38,171 --> 01:55:40,131
I still don't see why you want to travel
this way.

859
01:55:40,215 --> 01:55:43,342
I mean, what the hell can the two
of you do on the train for 16 hours?

860
01:55:45,345 --> 01:55:47,096
Say goodbye to Felix, darling.

861
01:55:58,734 --> 01:56:00,610
Now, the first thing to learn
in playing gin rummy

862
01:56:00,694 --> 01:56:03,195
is to never take a card
from the exposed pile,

863
01:56:03,322 --> 01:56:04,739
unless you really need it.

864
01:56:11,455 --> 01:56:12,538
Gin.

865
01:56:17,711 --> 01:56:20,129
James, what are you doing?

866
01:56:23,342 --> 01:56:25,176
Just testing an old adage.

867
01:56:25,886 --> 01:56:27,595
Unlucky at cards...

868
01:56:50,202 --> 01:56:53,037
- Do hurry up, James.
- Won't be a moment, darling.

869
01:57:21,483 --> 01:57:24,151
Lock the door as well on your way up,
would you, James?

870
01:57:26,613 --> 01:57:27,613
After all,

871
01:57:28,240 --> 01:57:31,200
we wouldn't want anyone
to just walk in on us, would we?

872
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:39,959
The first time in my life,
I feel like a complete woman.

873
01:57:42,295 --> 01:57:44,505
The slightest touch of your hand,

874
01:57:45,716 --> 01:57:49,301
I was always so afraid that a part
of me would stay with the past.

875
01:57:50,137 --> 01:57:53,305
But now I know there's no chance
of that any longer.

876
01:57:53,473 --> 01:57:56,642
Just to be able to reach out and touch you.

877
01:58:00,188 --> 01:58:02,606
Mr. Bond, it's good to see you again.

878
01:59:52,425 --> 01:59:54,426
Well, that wasn't very funny.

879
01:59:57,138 --> 01:59:58,764
Now what are you doing?

880
02:00:03,562 --> 02:00:05,396
Just being disarming, darling.

881
02:00:18,618 --> 02:00:20,327
When you were young

882
02:00:20,412 --> 02:00:24,456
And your heart was an open book

883
02:00:26,793 --> 02:00:30,796
You used to say live and let live

884
02:00:31,089 --> 02:00:34,884
You know you did, you know you did
You know you did

885
02:00:35,218 --> 02:00:40,973
But if this ever-changing world
in which we live in

886
02:00:41,141 --> 02:00:45,644
Makes you give in and cry

887
02:00:47,981 --> 02:00:50,190
Say live and let die

888
02:00:53,194 --> 02:01:03,329
Live and let die
