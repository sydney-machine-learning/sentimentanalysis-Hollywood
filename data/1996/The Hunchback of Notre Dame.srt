1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,840
Morning in Paris
The city awakes

2
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,480
To the bells of Notre Dame

3
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,760
The fisherman fishes
The baker man bakes

4
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,800
To the bells of Notre Dame

5
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,160
To the big bells
as loud as the thunder

6
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,640
To the little bells
soft as a psalm

7
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,000
And some say the soul
of the city's the toll

8
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,360
Of the bells

9
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,440
The bells of Notre Dame

10
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,320
Listen. They're beautiful, no?

11
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,560
So many colours of sound,
so many changing moods.

12
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,600
Because, you know, they
do not ring all by themselves.

13
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,800
- They don't?
- No, you silly boy.

14
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,320
Up there, high,
high in the dark bell tower...

15
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,280
Lives the mysterious
bell ringer.

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,280
- Who is this creature?
- Who?

17
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,600
- What is he?
- What?

18
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,960
- How did he come to be there?
- How?

19
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,680
- Hush.
- Ow.

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,520
Clopping will tell you.

21
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,280
It is a tale...

22
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,480
a tale of a man
and a monster.

23
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,680
Dark was the night
when our tale was begun

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,920
- On the docks near Notre Dame
- Shut it up, will you?

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,760
- We'll be spotted!
- Hush, little one.

26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,800
Four frightened Gypsies
slid silently under

27
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,280
The docks near Notre Dame

28
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,240
Four guilders
for safe passage into Paris.

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,120
A trap had been laid
for the Gypsies

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,760
And they gazed up
in fear and alarm

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,840
At a figure whose clutches
were iron as much as the bells

32
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,600
Judge Claude Frollo!

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,880
The bells

34
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,600
Of Notre Dame

35
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,360
Judge Claude Frollo longed
to purge the world of vice and sin

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,280
And he saw corruption
everywhere except within

37
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,160
Bring these Gypsy vermin
to the Palace of Justice.

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,600
- You, there! What are you hiding?
- Stolen goods, no doubt.

39
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,040
Take them from her.

40
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,320
She ran!

41
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Sanctuary!
Please, give us sanctuary!

42
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,000
A baby?

43
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,200
A monster!

44
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,040
- Stop!
- Cried the archdeacon.

45
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,080
This is an unholy demon. I'm sending it
back to hell, where it belongs.

46
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,160
See, there, the innocent blood
you have spilt

47
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
On the steps Of Notre Dame

48
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,920
I am guiltless.
She ran. I pursued.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,040
Now you would add this child's blood
to your guilt

50
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,080
- On the steps Of Notre Dame
- My conscience is clear.

51
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,120
You can lie to yourself
and your minions

52
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,320
You can claim
that you haven't a qualm

53
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,640
But you never can run from

54
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,880
Nor hide what you've done
from the eyes

55
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,400
The very eyes

56
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:32,320
Of Notre Dame

57
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,320
And for one time in his life
of power and control

58
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:46,160
Frollo felt a twinge of fear
for his immortal soul

59
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,160
- What must I do?
- Care for the child,
and raise it as your own.

60
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,840
What? I am to be saddled
with this misshapen--

61
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,160
Very well, but let him live
with you in your church.

62
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,680
- Live here? Where?
- Anywhere.

63
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,680
Just so he's kept locked away
where no one else can see

64
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,640
The bell tower, perhaps.

65
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,680
And who knows? Our Lord
works in mysterious ways.

66
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,680
Even this foul creature
may yet prove one day to be

67
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,920
Of use to me

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,440
And Frollo gave the child
a cruel name...

69
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,320
a name that means
"half-formed."

70
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,560
Quasimodo.

71
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,000
Nowhere is a riddle
to guess if you can

72
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,440
Sing the bells Of Notre Dame

73
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,640
Who is the monster
and who is the man

74
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,280
Sing the bells, bells
bells, bells

75
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,440
Bells, bells
bells, bells

76
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,200
Bells Of Notre Dame

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,480
Good morning.

78
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,640
Will today be the day?
Are you ready to fly?

79
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,200
You sure?
Good day to try.

80
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,600
Why, if-if I picked a day to fly,
oh, this would be it.

81
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,680
The Festival of Fools.

82
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,640
It will be fun, with jugglers
and-and-and music and dancing.

83
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,320
Go on. Nobody wants to be
cooped up here for ever.

84
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,720
Man! I thought he'd never leave.
I'll be spittin' feathers for a week.

85
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,960
Well, that's what you get
for sleeping with your mouth open.

86
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,480
Go scare a nun. Hey, Quasi,
what's goin' on out there?

87
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,360
- A fight? A flogging?
- A festival.

88
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,760
- You mean the Feast of Fools?
- Uh-huh.
- All right, all right!

89
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,760
Pour the wine
and cut the cheese.

90
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,200
It is a treat to watch the colourful
pageantry of the simple peasant folk.

91
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,480
Boy, nothin' like balcony seats
for watching the ol' F.O.F.

92
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,840
- Yeah, watchin'.
- Oh, look. A mime.

93
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,680
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What gives?

94
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,360
Aren't you going to watch
the festival with us?

95
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,000
- I don't get it.
- Perhaps he's sick.

96
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,720
Impossible. If 20 years
of listenin' to you two...

97
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
hasn't made him sick by now,
nothin' will.

98
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,400
But watching
the Festival of Fools...

99
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,920
has always been the highlight
of the year for Quasimodo.

100
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,120
What good is watchin' a party
if you never get to go?

101
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,040
Here, get away from me!
Go on, ya bunch of buzzards.

102
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,040
He's not made of stone,
like us.

103
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,640
Quasi, what's wrong? You wanna tell
ol' Laverne all about it?

104
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,680
I-- I just don't feel like
watching the festival, that's all.

105
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,160
Well, did ya ever think
of goin' there instead?

106
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,480
Sure, but I'd never
fit in out there.

107
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,640
I'm not normal.

108
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,600
Oh, Quasi, Quasi, Quasi.

109
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,760
Do ya mind? I would like
to have a moment...

110
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,440
with the boy,
if it's all right with you!

111
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,240
Hey, quit beatin' around the bell tower.
What do we gotta do?

112
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,360
- Paint ya a fresco?
- As your friends and guardians...

113
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,400
we insist
you attend the festival.

114
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,520
- Me?
- No, the pope. Of course, you!

115
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,160
It would be a veritable potpourri
of educational experience.

116
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,840
- Wine, women and song.
- You can learn...

117
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,520
to identify
various regional cheeses.

118
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,920
- Bobbin' for snails.
- Study indigenous folk music.

119
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,720
- Playin' Dunk the Monk!
- Quasi, take it from an old spectator.

120
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,720
Life's not a spectator sport.

121
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,480
If watchin'
is all you're gonna do...

122
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,040
then you're gonna watch
your life go by without ya.

123
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,720
Yeah, you're human, with the flesh
and the hair and the navel lint.

124
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,880
We're just part
of the architecture, right, Victor?

125
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:13,840
Yet, if you kick us, will we not flake?
If you moisten us, do we not grow moss?

126
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,360
Quasi, just grab a fresh tunic
and a clean pair of hose, and--

127
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,120
Thanks for the encouragement,
but you're all forgetting one big thing.

128
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,680
- What?
- My master Frollo.

129
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,880
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, dear, yes.

130
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,720
W-Well, when he says you're forbidden
from ever leaving the bell tower...

131
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,480
d-does he mean "ever" eve r?

132
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,440
Never eve r. And he hates
the Feast of Fools.

133
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,840
- He'd be furious if I asked to go.
- Who says ya gotta ask?

134
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
- Oh, no.
- Ya sneak out--

135
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,360
- It's just one afternoon.
- I-l couldn't.

136
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,480
- And ya sneak back in.
- He'll never know you were gone.

137
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,680
- And if I got caught.
- Better to beg forgiveness
than ask permission.

138
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,520
- He might see me.
- You could wear a disguise.

139
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,480
Just this once. What Frollo
doesn't know can't hurt ya.

140
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,280
- Ignorance is bliss.
- Look who's talkin'.

141
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,760
Nobody wants to stay
cooped up here for ever.

142
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,040
- You're right. I'll go.
- Oh, boy !
- Oh, hurrah!

143
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,360
- I'll get cleaned up.
- Yea!
- Yes, sir!

144
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
- I'll stroll down those stairs.
- There ya go!

145
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,960
I'll march through the doors and--

146
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,240
Good morning, Quasimodo.

147
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,880
Oh, good m-morning, Master.

148
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,960
Dear boy,
whomever are you talking to?

149
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,480
My...

150
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,680
friends.

151
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,080
I see. And what are your
friends made of, Quasimodo?

152
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Stone.

153
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Can stone talk?

154
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,240
- No, it can't.
- That's right.

155
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,160
You're a smart lad.
Now, lunch.

156
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,640
Shall we review
your alphabet today?

157
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,200
Oh, yes, Master.
I would like that very much.

158
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,680
- Very well. "A"?
- Abomination.

159
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,240
- " B"?
- Blasphemy?

160
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,240
- "C"?
- C-C-Contrition.

161
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,680
- " D"?
- Damnation?

162
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,680
- " E "?
- Eternal damnation.

163
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,000
- Good. " F"?
- Festival.

164
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,600
- Excuse me?
- F-F-Forgiveness.

165
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,120
- You said "festival."
- No!

166
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,880
You are thinking
about going to the festival.

167
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,920
I-It's just that
you go every year.

168
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,160
I am a public official.
I must go.

169
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,400
But I don't enjoy a moment.

170
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,560
Thieves and cut purses,
the dregs of humankind...

171
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,040
all mixed together
in a shallow, drunken stupor.

172
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,080
I didn't mean
to upset you, Master.

173
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,960
Quasimodo,
can't you understand?

174
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,160
When your heartless mother
abandoned you as a child...

175
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,400
anyone else
would have drowned you.

176
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,120
And this is my thanks for taking you in
and raising you as my son?

177
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,800
I'm sorry, sir.

178
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,640
Oh, my dear Quasimodo.

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,440
You don't know
what it's like out there.

180
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,160
I do. I do.

181
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,120
The world is cruel

182
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,240
The world is wicked

183
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,240
It's I alone whom you can trust
in this whole city

184
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,040
I am your only friend

185
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,960
I who keep you, teach you
feed you, dress you

186
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,040
I who look upon you
without fear

187
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,840
How can l protect you, boy
unless you always stay in here

188
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,120
A way in here

189
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,080
Remember what
I've taught you, Quasimodo.

190
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,960
- You are deformed
- I am deformed

191
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,480
-And you are ugly
-And l am ugly

192
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,840
And these are crimes
for which the world shows little pity

193
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,960
- You do not comprehend
- You are my one defender

194
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,360
Out there they'll
revile you as a monster

195
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,000
I am a monster

196
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,760
Out there they will hate
and scorn and jeer

197
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,240
Only a monster

198
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,200
Why invite their calumny
and consternation

199
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,120
Stay in here

200
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,640
- Be faithful to me
- I'm faithful

201
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,680
- Grateful to me
- I'm grateful

202
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,080
Do as l say
Obey

203
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,440
-And stay in here
- I'll stay in here

204
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,240
You are good to me, Master.
I'm sorry.

205
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,840
You are forgiven.

206
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,400
But remember, Quasimodo,
this is your sanctuary.

207
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,160
My sanctuary.

208
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,840
Safe behind these windows
and these parapets of stone

209
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,920
Gazing at the people
down below me

210
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,800
All my life I watch them
as l hide up here alone

211
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,720
Hungry for the histories
they show me

212
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,560
All my life
l memorise their faces

213
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,480
Knowing them
as they will never know me

214
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,160
All my life I wonder
how it feels to pass a day

215
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,880
Not above them

216
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,400
But part of them

217
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,160
And out there

218
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,680
Living in the sun

219
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,360
Give me one day
out there

220
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,720
A Ill ask is one

221
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,920
To hold for ever

222
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,840
Out there

223
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,360
Where they all live unaware

224
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
What I'd give

225
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,600
What I'd dare

226
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,480
Just to live
one day

227
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,240
Out there

228
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,480
Out there among the millers
and the weavers and their wives

229
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,960
Through the roofs and gables
I can see them

230
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,600
Every day they shout and scold
and go about their lives

231
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,680
Heedless of the gift it is
to be them

232
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,560
If l was in their skin

233
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,000
I'd treasure every instant

234
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,760
Out there

235
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,400
Strolling by the Seine

236
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,400
Taste the morning

237
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,800
Out there

238
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,560
Like ordinary men

239
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,280
Who freely walk about there

240
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,640
Just one day and then

241
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,960
I swear I'll be content

242
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,360
With my share

243
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,680
Won't resent
Won't despair

244
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,240
Old and bent
I won't care

245
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,800
I'll have spent

246
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,360
One day

247
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,160
Out there

248
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,720
Hmm. Uh-uh. You leave town
for a couple of decades...

249
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,920
and they change everything.

250
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,200
Excuse me, gentlemen, I'm looking
for the Palace of Justice.

251
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,200
Would you--
Mmm. I guess not.

252
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,160
What are you trying to say to me?
That the pants do not--

253
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,760
They fit.

254
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,720
- Ahh!
- Stay away, child.

255
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,160
They're Gypsies.
They'll steal us blind.

256
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,280
All right, Gypsy.
Where'd ya get the money?

257
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,040
- For your information, I earned it.
- Gypsies don't earn money.

258
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,040
- They steal it.
- You'd know a lot about stealing.

259
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,800
Troublemaker, huh?

260
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,840
Maybe a day in the stocks
will cool ya down.

261
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,760
Come back here, Gypsy !

262
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,040
- Achilles, sit.
- Hey-- Whoa!

263
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,440
Oh, dear, I'm sorry.
Naughty horse! Naughty !

264
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,600
He's just impossible.
Really, I can't take him anywhere.

265
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,680
Get this thing off me!

266
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,320
I'll teach you a lesson,
peasant!

267
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,800
You were saying,
Lieutenant?

268
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,240
Oh, uh-uh.
C-C-Captain!

269
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,440
Ow! At your service, sir.

270
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,680
I know you have a lot on your mind
right now, but the Palace of Justice?

271
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,960
- Make way for the Captain.
- Go on, make way !

272
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,720
Make way.
Everybody out of the way.

273
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,480
You, make way for the Captain!

274
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,880
- Make way.
- Make way now.

275
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,120
Come on, boy.
Achilles, heel!

276
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,400
- Stop.
- Sir?

277
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,920
Ease up.
Wait between lashes.

278
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,640
Otherwise the old sting
will dull him to the new.

279
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,880
Yes, sir.

280
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,360
Ah, so this is the gallant
Captain Phoebus, home from the wars.

281
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,160
Reporting for duty
as ordered, sir.

282
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,880
Your service record
precedes you, Phoebus.

283
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,560
I expect nothing but the best
from a war hero of your calibre.

284
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,440
And you shall have it, sir.
I guarantee it.

285
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,280
Yes. You know, my last
Captain of the Guard was, um...

286
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,680
a bit of a disappointment to me.

287
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,880
Well, no matter. I'm sure
you'll whip my men into shape.

288
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,640
Uh, thank you. It's a grea-- uh, tre--
uh, tremendous honour, sir.

289
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,560
You've come to Paris
in her darkest hour, Captain.

290
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,200
It will take a firm hand to save the
weak-minded from being so easily misled.

291
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,440
- Misled, sir?
- Look, Captain.

292
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,040
Gypsies. The Gypsies live
outside the normal order.

293
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,720
Their heathen ways inflame
the people's lowest instincts.

294
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,600
And they must be stopped.

295
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,240
I was summoned from the wars to capture
fortune-tellers and palm readers?

296
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,960
Eh, the real war, Captain,
is what you see before you.

297
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,440
For 20 years, I have been
taking care of the Gypsies...

298
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,160
one by one.

299
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,120
And yet, for all my success,
they have thrived.

300
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,280
I believe they have a safe have n
within the walls of this very city.

301
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,600
A-A nest, if you will.
They call it the Court of Miracles.

302
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,680
What are we going to do
about it, sir?

303
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,280
You make your point
quite vividly, sir.

304
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,480
You know, I like you, Captain.
Shall we?

305
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,080
Oh, duty calls. Have you ever attended
a peasant festival, Captain?

306
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,680
Not recently, sir.

307
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,760
Then this should be quite
an education for you. Come along.

308
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,840
Come, one

309
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,920
Come, all

310
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Leave your looms
and milking stools

311
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,560
Coop the hens
and pen the mules

312
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,800
Come, one

313
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,480
Come, all

314
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,720
Close the churches
and the schools

315
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,720
It's the day
for breaking rules

316
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,400
Come and join the Feast

317
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,800
Of

318
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,200
Fools

319
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,920
Once a year we throw a party
here in town

320
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,160
Once a year we turn all Paris
upside-down

321
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,440
Every man's a king
and every king's a clown

322
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,680
Once again
it's Topsy-turvy Day

323
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,880
It's the day the devil in us
gets released

324
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,040
It's the day we mock the prig
and shock the priest

325
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,840
Everything is topsy-turvy
at the Feast of Fools

326
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,480
Topsy-turvy

327
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,040
Everything is upsy-daisy

328
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,480
Topsy-turvy

329
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,440
Everybody's acting crazy

330
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Dross is gold
and weeds are a bouquet

331
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,480
That's the way
on Topsy-turvy Day

332
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,880
Whoa!

333
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,440
Hey! Are you all right?

334
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,280
I-l didn't mean to.
I-l'm sorry.

335
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,760
Oh, you're not hurt, are you?
Here, here, let's see.

336
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,840
- No, no! N-No!
- There.

337
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,000
See? No harm done.

338
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,880
-Just try to be a little more careful.
- I-l-- I-l will.

339
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,440
By the way, great mask.

340
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,640
Topsy-turvy

341
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,040
Beat the drums
and blow the trumpets

342
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,000
Topsy-turvy

343
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,440
Join the bums
and thieves and strumpets

344
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,760
Streaming in
from Chartres to Calais

345
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,840
Scurvy knaves are extra scurvy
on the Sixth of Janu-ervy

346
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,120
All because
it's Topsy-turvy Day

347
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,240
Come, one

348
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,880
Come, all

349
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Hurry, hurry
Here's your chance

350
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,800
See the mystery
and romance

351
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,080
Come, one

352
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,680
Come, all

353
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,000
See the finest girl
in France

354
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,120
Make an entrance
to entrance

355
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,560
Dance
La Esmeralda

356
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,240
Dance

357
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,600
- Look at that disgusting display.
- Yes, sir.

358
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:57,200
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the pièce de résistance!

359
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,720
Here it is
The moment you've been waiting for

360
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,080
Here it is
You know exactly what's in store

361
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,320
Now's the time we laugh
until our sides get sore

362
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,200
Now's the time
we crown the King of Fools

363
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,760
You all remember
last year's king

364
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,280
So make a face
that's horrible and frightening

365
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,520
- Make a face that's gruesome
as a gargoyle's wing
- Hey !

366
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,680
For the face that's ugliest
will be the King of Fools

367
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,160
- Why?
- Topsy-turvy

368
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,200
- Ugly folks, forget your shyness
- Topsy-turvy

369
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,960
You could soon be called
Your Highness

370
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,000
Put your foulest features
on display

371
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,160
Be the King
of Topsy-turvy Day

372
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,600
Boo!

373
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,000
- Bleah!
- Boo!

374
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,840
- That's no mask.
- It's his face!

375
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,560
- He's hideous!
- It's the bell ringer from Notre Dame!

376
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,960
Oh! Oh! Oh!

377
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,120
Ladies and gentlemen,
don't panic.

378
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,280
We asked for the ugliest face
in Paris, and here it is!

379
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,440
Quasimodo,
the hunchback of Notre Dame!

380
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,760
Everybody

381
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,400
Once a year

382
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,680
- We throw a party here in town
- Whoa!

383
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,680
- Where fools are king
- Once a year

384
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,240
- We turn all Paris upside-down
- Oh, what a king

385
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,440
Once a year
the ugliest will wear a crown

386
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,800
- Girls, give a kiss
- Right here on Topsy-turvy Day

387
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,520
We've never had a king like this
And it's the day we do the things
that we deplore

388
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,160
On the other
three hundred and sixty-four

389
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,280
Once a year we love to drop in
where the beer is never stoppin'

390
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,080
- For the chance
to pop some popinjay
- Oh!

391
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,120
And pick a king
who'll put the "top" in

392
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,360
Topsy-turvy

393
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,880
Topsy-turvy
Mad-and-crazy

394
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,960
Upsy-daisy
Topsy-turvy Day

395
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,960
Quasimodo! Quasimodo! Quasimodo!

396
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,120
- You think he's ugly now? Watch this.
- Quasimodo! Quasimodo! Quasimodo!

397
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,600
Oh!

398
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,520
Now that's ugly!

399
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,320
- Hail to the King!
- Oh!

400
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,480
- Oh!
- Bon appétit!

401
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,160
Whoa!

402
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,080
Where are you goin',
hunchback?

403
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,080
The fun's just beginning.

404
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,160
Master!

405
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,560
Master, please.
Help me!

406
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,560
Sir, request permission
to stop this cruelty.

407
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,760
In a moment, Captain.
A lesson needs to be learned here.

408
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,600
Don't be afraid.

409
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,640
I'm sorry.

410
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,920
This wasn't supposed
to happen.

411
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,560
You! Gypsy girl!
Get down at once!

412
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,920
Yes, Your Honour. Just as soon
as I free this poor creature.

413
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,280
I forbid it!

414
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,160
How dare you defy me!

415
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,240
You mistreat this poor boy
the same way you mistreat my people.

416
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,880
You speak of justice, yet you are cruel
to those most in need of your help.

417
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,480
- Silence!
-Justice!

418
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,720
Mark my words, Gypsy.
You will pay for this insolence.

419
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,480
Then it appears
we've crowned the wrong fool.

420
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,160
The only fool I see
is you!

421
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,840
Captain Phoebus,
arrest her.

422
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,920
Now, let's see. One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

423
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,720
So there's ten of you and one of me.
What's a poor girl to do?

424
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,240
- Witch craft !
- Oh, boys. Over here.

425
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,760
- There she is!
- Get her!

426
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,240
I'm free. I'm free.
Dang it.

427
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,000
Whoa!

428
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,160
What a woman!

429
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,440
Whoa!

430
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,760
Find her, Captain.
I want her alive.

431
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,520
Yes, sir.
Seal off the area, men.

432
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,920
Find the Gypsy girl,
and do not harm her.

433
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:30,240
I am sorry, Master.
I will never disobey you again.

434
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,440
- Oh!
- Stand back. Stand back.

435
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,200
Stand back.
He's coming.

436
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,080
Oh, he's hideous. I--

437
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,720
- Maybe over there.
- You, there. Get away.

438
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,160
- Move on, peasant!
- Hmm.

439
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,480
Uh. Oh, you!

440
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,520
Easy, easy.
I-l-l just shaved this morning.

441
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,320
- Oh, really? You missed a spot.
- All right, all right.

442
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,000
J-Just c-calm down.
Just give me a chance to apologise.

443
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,600
For what?

444
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,480
- That, for example.
- You sneaky son of a--

445
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,080
Ah, ah, ah. Watch it.
You're in a church.

446
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,320
Are you always this charming,
or am I just lucky?

447
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,240
Whoa!

448
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,160
Candlelight,
privacy, music.

449
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,480
Can't think of a better place
for hand-to-hand combat.

450
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,080
Ooh! You fight
almost as well as a man.

451
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,000
Funny, I was going to say
the same thing about you.

452
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,040
That's hitting a little below
the belt, don't you think?

453
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,480
No, this is.

454
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,400
Touché. Ohh!

455
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,040
I didn't know
you had a kid.

456
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,040
Well, he doesn't
take kindly to soldiers.

457
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,880
Eh, I noticed.
Ah, permit me.

458
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,360
I'm Phoebus.
It means "sun god."

459
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,320
- And you are?
- Is this an interrogation?

460
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,080
I believe it's called
an introduction.

461
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,680
-You're not arresting me?
-Not as long as you're in here. I can't.

462
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,680
- Huh. You're not at all
like the other soldiers.
- Thank you.

463
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,000
So, if you're not going
to arrest me, what do you want?

464
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,840
I'd settle for your name.

465
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,480
- Esmeralda.
- Beautiful.

466
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,080
And much better than
Phoebus, anyway.

467
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,040
Good work, Captain.
Now, arrest her.

468
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,360
Claim "sanctuary."

469
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,360
- Say it!
- You tricked me.

470
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,640
I'm waiting, Captain.

471
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,480
I'm sorry, sir. She claimed "sanctuary."
There's nothing I can do.

472
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,920
Then drag her
outside and--

473
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,320
Frollo, you will not
touch her!

474
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,440
Don't worry.
Minister Frollo learned years ago...

475
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,840
to respect the sanctity
of the Church.

476
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,160
All right, all right.

477
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,200
I'm going.

478
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,600
You think you've outwitted me...

479
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,640
but I'm a patient man...

480
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:48,240
and Gypsies don't do well
inside stone walls.

481
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,200
What are you doing?

482
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,680
I was just imagining a rope
around that beautiful neck.

483
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,920
I know what you were imagining.

484
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,600
Such a clever witch.

485
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,960
So typical of your kind
to twist the truth...

486
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,200
to cloud the mind
with unholy thoughts.

487
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,080
Well, no matter.

488
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,720
You've chosen a magnificent prison.
But it is a prison, nonetheless.

489
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,240
Set one foot outside...

490
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,040
and you're mine.

491
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,640
Frollo's orders.
Post a guard at every door.

492
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Don't worry, Djali. If Frollo thinks
he can keep us here, he's wrong.

493
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,480
Don't act rashly, my child.

494
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,880
You created quite a stir
at the festival.

495
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,040
It would be unwise to arouse
Frollo's anger further.

496
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,600
You saw what he did out there,
letting the crowd torture that poor boy.

497
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,280
I thought if just one person
could stand up to him, then w--

498
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,200
Huh. What do they have against people
who are different, anyway?

499
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,760
You can't right all the wrongs
of this world by yourself.

500
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,840
Well, no one out there
is going to help, that's for sure.

501
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,880
Well, perhaps there's someone
in here who can.

502
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,560
I don't know
if you can hear me

503
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,440
Or if you're even there

504
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,920
I don't know
if you would listen

505
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,640
To a Gypsy's prayer

506
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,120
Yes, l know
I'm just an outcast

507
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,240
I shouldn't speak to you

508
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,040
Still, l see your face
and wonder

509
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,680
Were you once

510
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,440
An outcast too

511
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,280
God, help the outcasts

512
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,320
Hungry from birth

513
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,000
Show them the mercy

514
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,960
They don't find on earth

515
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,200
God, help my people

516
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,040
We look to you still

517
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,600
God, help the outcasts

518
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,160
Or nobody will

519
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,360
I ask for wealth

520
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,800
I ask for fame

521
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,040
I ask for glory

522
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,400
To shine on my name

523
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,600
I ask for love

524
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,000
I can possess

525
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,840
I ask for God and His angels

526
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,440
To bless me

527
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,760
I ask for nothing

528
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,800
I can get by

529
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,200
But l know so many

530
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,920
Less lucky than I

531
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,200
Please help my people

532
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,080
The poor and down trod

533
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,760
I thought we all were

534
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:28,800
The children of God

535
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,920
God, help the outcast

536
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,400
Children of

537
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:44,200
God

538
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,760
You! Bell ringer!
What are you doing down here?

539
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,320
Oh!

540
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,480
Haven't you caused
enough trouble already?

541
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,320
Wait.

542
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,520
I-l want
to talk to you.

543
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,680
Look, h-he's got
a friend with him.

544
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,160
Yeah. Maybe today wasn't
a total loss after all.

545
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,800
- A vision of loveliness.
- The one in the dress ain't bad either.

546
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,720
- Hurray !
- Way to go, Quasi!
- Congratulations!

547
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,080
- We knew you had it in ya.
- Got the girls chasin' ya already.
- A-A-Actually, l--

548
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,200
You mustn't run too fast,
or she'll get away.

549
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,640
Yes, l-l-l-l know.
That's what l--

550
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,200
Give her some slack,
then reel her in.

551
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,080
Then give her some slack,
then reel her in.

552
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,160
- Then give her some slack--
- Knock it off, Hugo.

553
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,240
She's a girl,
not a mackerel.

554
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,720
Here you are.

555
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,720
- I was afraid I'd lost you.
- Yes.

556
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,080
Well, l, uh--
I have chores to do.

557
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,120
I-l-l-lt was nice
seeing you again.

558
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,080
- Oh!
- N-No, wait!

559
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,960
I'm really sorry about this afternoon.
I had no idea who you were.

560
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,400
I-l would never in my life
have pulled you...

561
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,000
up on the...

562
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
stage.

563
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,920
- What is this place?
- This is where I live.

564
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,720
Did you make
all these things yourself?

565
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,800
- Most of them.
- This is beautiful.

566
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,320
Oh, if I could do this,
you wouldn't find me dancing
in the streets for coins.

567
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,200
- But you're a wonderful dancer.
- Well, it keeps bread on the table,
anyway.

568
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,880
- What's this?
- Oh! No, please! l-l-l--

569
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,920
I-l'm not finished.
I-l-l still have to paint them.

570
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,760
It's the blacksmith.
And the baker!

571
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,920
You're a surprising person,
Quasimodo.

572
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,240
Not to mention lucky.
All this room to yourself.

573
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,360
Well, it's not just me.
There's the gargoyles...

574
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,280
and, of course, the bells.

575
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,800
- Would you like to see them?
- Yes, of course. Wouldn't we, Djali?

576
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,440
Follow me.
I'll introduce you.

577
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,200
I never knew
there were so many.

578
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,320
That's Little Sophia. And Jeane-Marie,
Anne-Marie, Louise-Marie.

579
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,440
- Triplets, you know.
- And who's this?

580
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,080
- Big Marie.
- Hello!

581
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,680
She likes you.
Would you like to see more?

582
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,560
How about it, Djali?

583
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,600
- We'd love to.
- Good. I've saved the best for last.

584
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,000
Oh!

585
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,400
I bet the king himself
doesn't have a view like this.

586
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,760
I could stay
up here forever.

587
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,400
- Y-You could, you know.
- No, I couldn't.

588
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,360
- Oh, yes, you have sanctuary.
- But not freedom.

589
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,000
Gypsies don't do well
inside stone walls.

590
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:44,480
But y-y-you're not like other Gypsies.
They are evil.

591
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,160
- Who told you that?
- My master Frollo. He raised me.

592
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,120
How can such a cruel man
have raised someone like you?

593
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,240
Cruel? Oh, no.
He saved my life.

594
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,200
He took me in when no one else would.
I am a monster, you know.

595
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,960
- He told you that?
- Look at me.

596
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,000
- Give me your hand.
- Why?
-Just let me see it.

597
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,720
Hmm. A long life line.

598
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,320
Oh, and this one
means you're shy.

599
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,800
Hmm. Hmm, mmm, mmm.

600
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,400
- Well, that's funny.
- What?

601
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,840
- I don't see any--
- Any what?

602
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,840
Monster lines.
Not a single one.

603
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,640
Now, you look at me.
Do you think I'm evil?

604
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,920
No! No-No. You-You are kind
and good and-and--

605
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,160
And a Gypsy. And maybe Frollo's wrong
about the both of us.

606
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,680
- What did she say?
- Frollo's nose is long,
and he wears a truss.

607
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,400
Ha! Told ya.
Pay up.

608
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,160
- Oh, dear.
- Chump.

609
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,080
You helped me.
Now I will help you.

610
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,800
But there's no way out.
There're soldiers at every door.

611
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,160
- We won't use a door.
- You mean, climb down?

612
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,320
- Sure. You carry him, I carry you.
- Okay.

613
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,840
Come on, Djali.

614
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,800
- Ready?
- Yes.
- Don't be afraid.

615
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,920
I'm not afraid.

616
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,120
- Now I'm afraid.
- The trick is not to look down.

617
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,720
- You've done this before?
- No.

618
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,120
- Wow, you're quite an acrobat.
- Thank you.

619
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,440
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

620
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,640
- Check the alley !
- This way.

621
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,520
- I hope I didn't scare you.
- Not for an instant.

622
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,440
I'll never forget you, Esmeralda.

623
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,800
- Come with me.
- What?
- To the Court of Miracles.

624
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,560
- Leave this place.
- Oh, no.

625
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,480
I'm never going back out there again.
You saw what happened today.

626
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,280
No. This is where I belong.

627
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,320
- All right, then I'll come to see you.
- Here? But the soldiers and Frollo!

628
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,680
- I'll come after sunset.
- But at-at-at sunset...

629
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,720
I ring the evening mass, a-and after
that I clean the cloisters...

630
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,920
a-and then I ring the vespers, and--

631
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,960
- Whatever's good for you.
- If you ever need sanctuary,
this will show you the way.

632
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,960
- But how?
-Just remember...

633
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,840
when you wear this woven band,
you hold the city in your hand.

634
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,440
- Keep your eyes open.
- Hurry. You must go.

635
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,400
- Check the alley.
- Yes, sir.

636
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,920
- No one's here, sir.
- No one here, sir.

637
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,680
Check the street.

638
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,680
Hi, there. I'm looking
for the Gypsy girl. Have you seen her?

639
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy !

640
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,840
No soldiers !
Sanctuary! Get out!

641
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,640
- Wait! All I want is to--
- Go!

642
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,840
- I mean her no harm.
- Go!

643
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,160
You tell her for me,
I didn't mean to trap her here...

644
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,560
but it was the only way
I could save her life.

645
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,240
Will you tell her that?

646
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,360
- Will you?
- If you go. Now !

647
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,120
I'll go. Now, will you
put me down, please?

648
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,920
Oh, and one more thing.

649
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,640
Tell Esmeralda she's very lucky.

650
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,240
- Why?
- To have a friend like you.

651
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,760
Hey, hey! There he is!

652
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,440
- Yeah!
- Ooh, wonderful! Bravo! Fantissimo!
- Ooh-hoo!

653
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,920
You ejected that tin-plated
buffoon with great panache.

654
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,800
The nerve of him, snoopin' around here,
tryin' to steal your girl.

655
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,920
- My girl?
- Esmeralda. Dark hair,
works with a goat, remember?

656
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,360
Boy, I do.
Way to go, lover boy !

657
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,640
" Lover boy"?
Oh, no, no, no, no.

658
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,360
Oh, don't be so modest.

659
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,320
Look, I appreciate
what you're all trying to do.

660
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,840
But let's not fool ourselves.

661
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,400
" Ugliest face in all Paris,"
remember?

662
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,760
I don't think
I'm her type.

663
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,760
So many times out there

664
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,920
I've watched a happy pair

665
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,680
Of lovers
walking in the night

666
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,320
They had a kind of glow
around them

667
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:38,160
It almost looked like
heaven's light

668
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,280
I knew I'd never know

669
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,680
That warm and loving glow

670
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,400
Though l might wish
with all my might

671
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,160
No face as hideous
as my face

672
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,320
Was ever meant
for heaven's light

673
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:02,040
But suddenly an angel
has smiled at me

674
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:07,880
And kissed my cheek
without a trace off right

675
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,440
I dare to dream that she

676
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,560
Might even care for me

677
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:17,720
-And as l ring
these bells tonight
- Eh?

678
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,160
My cold, dark tower
seems so bright

679
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:30,640
I swear
it must be heaven's light

680
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,280
You know l am
a righteous man

681
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,280
Of my virtue
l am justly proud

682
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,960
You know
I'm so much purer than

683
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,120
The common, vulgar
weak, licentious crowd

684
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,840
Then tell me, Maria

685
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,480
Why l see her
dancing there

686
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,720
Why her smouldering eyes
still scorch my soul

687
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,840
I feel her
l see her

688
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,560
The sun caught
in her raven hair

689
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,920
Is blazing in me
out of all control

690
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,440
Like fire

691
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,600
Hellfire

692
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,920
This fire in my skin

693
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,440
This burning desire

694
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:27,240
Is turning me
to sin

695
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,040
It's not my fault

696
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,840
I'm not to blame

697
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,760
It is the Gypsy girl
The witch who set this flame

698
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,200
It's not my fault
if in God's plan

699
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:45,800
He made the devil
so much stronger than a man

700
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,640
Protect me, Maria

701
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,360
Don't let this siren
cast her spell

702
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,240
Don't let her fire
sear my flesh and bone

703
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,920
Destroy Esmeralda

704
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,760
And let her taste
the fires of hell

705
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,920
Or else let her be mine
and mine alone

706
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,640
Minister Frollo,
the Gypsy has escaped.

707
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,040
- What?
- She's nowhere in the cathedral.

708
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,920
- She's gone.
- But how?

709
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,720
I--
Never mind.

710
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,640
Get out, you idiot.
I'll find her.

711
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,000
I'll find her if I have
to burn down all of Paris.

712
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,920
Hellfire
Dark fire

713
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,440
No w, Gypsy
It's your turn

714
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,440
Choose me
or your pyre

715
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:43,400
Be mine
or you will burn

716
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:49,320
God have mercy on her

717
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,880
God have mercy on me

718
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,840
But she will be mine

719
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,080
Or she

720
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,560
Will

721
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:15,640
Burn

722
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,680
'Tention!

723
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,840
Good morning, sir.

724
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,200
Are you feeling all right?

725
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,400
I had a little trouble
with the fire place.

726
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,000
- I see. Your orders, sir?
- Find the Gypsy girl.

727
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,680
Ten pieces of silver
for the Gypsy, Esmeralda.

728
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,480
Lock them up.

729
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,360
Twenty pieces of silver
for the Gypsy, Esmeralda.

730
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,640
Take them away.

731
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,840
Poor miller.
He's never harmed anyone.

732
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,600
Frollo's gone mad.

733
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,440
We found this Gypsy talisman
on your property.

734
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,920
Have you been harbouring Gypsies?

735
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,320
Our home is always open
to the weary traveller.

736
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,320
- Have mercy, my lord .
- I am placing you and your family...

737
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,600
under house arrest until
I get to the bottom of this.

738
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,640
If what you say is true and you are
innocent, then you have nothing to fear.

739
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:35,200
But we are innocent. I assure you.
We know nothing of these Gypsies.

740
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,920
- Burn it.
- What?

741
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,360
Until it smoulders. These people are
traitors and must be made examples of.

742
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,760
With all due respect, sir, I was
not trained to murder the innocent.

743
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,720
But you were trained
to follow orders.

744
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,400
Insolent coward .

745
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,880
The sentence
for insubordination is death.

746
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,960
Such a pity. You threw away
a promising career.

747
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,520
Consider it
my highest honour, sir.

748
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,200
Get him!
And don't hit my horse.

749
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,120
Don't waste your arrows.
Let the traitor rot in his watery grave.

750
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:11,200
Find the girl. If you have to burn
the city to the ground, so be it.

751
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,320
Sir, we have looked every where
and still no sign of the Gypsy girl.

752
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,480
I had the entire cathedral surrounded.

753
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:47,160
Guards at every door.
There was no way she could have escaped.

754
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,360
Unless--

755
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:59,000
- Oh, it doesn't look good.
- It's hopeless. Absolutely hopeless.

756
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,680
You're tellin' me.
I'm losin' to a bird !

757
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,880
Oh, but that poor Gypsy girl.

758
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,920
- I'm beginning the fear the worst.
- I know.

759
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,600
But now don't you say anything
to upset Quasimodo.

760
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,120
- He's worried enough already.
- Yeah, you're right.

761
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,880
- We better lighten up.
- Shh. Shh. Shh. Here he comes.

762
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,680
- Now, just stay calm.
- Not a word .

763
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,720
- Easy does it.
- Stone-faced.

764
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,680
Any sign of her?

765
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,320
Oh, it's a lost cause!

766
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,600
She could be anywhere! ln the stocks,
in the dungeon, on the rack! Oh!

767
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,680
- Nice work, Victor.
- No, he's right.

768
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,160
- What are we gonna do?
- What are you guys talkin' about?

769
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,000
If I know Esmeralda,
she's three steps ahead of Frollo...

770
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,760
- and well out of harm's way.
- Do you really think so?

771
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,200
Hey, when things cool off,
she'll be back. You'll see.

772
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,440
- What makes you so sure?
- Because she likes ya.

773
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,760
- We always said you were the cute one.
- I thought I was the cute one.

774
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,120
No, you're the fat, stupid one
with the big mouth!

775
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,600
What are you saying, exactly?

776
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,440
Take it from us, Quasi.
You got nothin' to worry about.

777
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,560
Yeah. You're irresistible.

778
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,880
Knights in shining armour
certainly aren't her type.

779
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,280
And those guys
are a dime a dozen.

780
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:07,480
But you,
you're one of a kind. Look.

781
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:12,200
Paris, the city of lovers
is glowing this evening

782
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,880
True, that's because it's on fire

783
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,360
But still there's I'amour

784
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,720
Somewhere out there
in the night

785
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,520
Her heart is also alight

786
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,280
And l know the guy

787
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,920
She just might be burning for

788
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,200
A guy like you

789
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,840
She's never known, kid

790
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,200
A guy like you
a girl does not meet every day

791
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,800
You've got a look
that's all your own, kid

792
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,480
Could there be two like you

793
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,600
No way

794
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,040
Those other guys

795
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,280
That she could dangle

796
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,880
All look the same
from every boring point of view

797
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,000
You're a surprise

798
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,480
From every angle

799
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:14,880
Mon dieu above
She's gotta love a guy like you

800
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,120
A guy like you

801
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,560
Gets extra credit

802
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,480
Because it's true you've got

803
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,000
-A certain something more
- You're aces, kid.

804
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,160
You see that face

805
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,320
Ya don't forget it

806
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,920
- Want something new
- That's you.

807
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,440
For sure

808
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,680
We all have gaped
at some Adonis

809
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:42,080
But then we crave a meal
more nourishing to chew

810
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:46,640
And since you're shaped
like a croissant is

811
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,200
No question of
She's gotta love a guy like you

812
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,520
Call me a hopeless romantic

813
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,920
But Quasi, l feel it

814
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,240
She wants you so

815
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:06,520
Any moment
she'll walk through that door

816
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,760
For

817
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,200
A guy so swell

818
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:15,360
A guy like you
With all you bring her

819
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,880
A fool could tell
it's why she fell

820
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,360
- For you-know- who
- We notice every string there

821
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,680
You'll ring the bell

822
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,480
You're the bell ringer

823
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,560
When she wants ooh-la-la

824
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,600
And she wants you-la-la

825
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,720
She will disco ver, guy

826
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,840
You're one heck of a guy

827
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,960
Who wouldn't love a guy like you

828
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,880
You got a lot
The rest have not

829
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,080
Gotta love a guy like you

830
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,560
Quasi? Quasimodo?

831
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,280
Esmeralda?

832
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:53,120
Esmeralda, you're all right!
I knew you'd come back!

833
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,640
You've done so much for me
already, my friend...

834
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,720
but I must ask your help
one more time.

835
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,640
Yes. Anything.

836
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:06,480
This is Phoebus. He's wounded
and a fugitive like me.

837
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,200
He can't go on much longer.
I knew he'd be safe here.

838
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,360
Please, can you hide him?

839
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,640
This way.

840
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,680
- Esmeralda.
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

841
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,400
You'll hide here
until you're strong enough to move.

842
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,160
Great. I could use a drink.

843
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,760
Yes!

844
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,960
Feels like a 1 470 Burgundy.
Not a good year.

845
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,240
That family owes you
their lives.

846
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,720
You're either the single bravest soldier
I've ever seen or the craziest.

847
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,680
Ex-soldier, remember?

848
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,360
Why is it, whenever we meet,
I end up bleeding?

849
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,920
You're lucky. That arrow
almost pierced your heart.

850
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,720
I'm not so sure it didn't.

851
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,120
I knew I'd never know

852
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,680
That warm and loving glow

853
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:24,520
Though l might wish
with all my might

854
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:29,040
No face as hideous
as my face

855
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:34,240
Was ever meant
for heaven's light

856
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,640
Frollo's coming.
You must leave.

857
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,760
Quick, follow me.
Go down the south tower steps.

858
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,520
Be careful, my friend.

859
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,120
Promise you won't let
anything happen to him.

860
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,600
- I promise.
- Thank you.

861
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,240
Quick! We gotta
stash the stiff.

862
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,560
Oh. Oh, Master. I-l-l-l
didn't think you'd be coming.

863
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,160
I am never too busy
to share a meal with you, dear boy.

864
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,040
I brought a little... treat.

865
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,400
Oh!

866
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,120
Is there something
troubling you, Quasimodo?

867
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,120
- Oh. No!
- Oh, but there is.

868
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,560
I know there is.

869
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:10,280
I think...
you're hiding something.

870
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,280
Oh, no, Master.
I-- There's no--

871
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,760
You're not eating, boy.

872
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,040
It's very good.
Thank you.

873
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,400
Seeds.

874
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,320
What's different in here?

875
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,280
Nothing, sir.

876
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,560
Isn't this one new?
It's awfully good.

877
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:41,280
Looks very much
like the Gypsy girl.

878
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:45,880
I know you helped her escape!

879
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,000
- But l--
- And now all Paris is burning...

880
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,960
because of you!

881
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,880
She was kind to me, Master.

882
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,720
You idiot! That wasn't kindness!
It was cunning!

883
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:01,040
She's a Gypsy !
Gypsies are not capable of real love !

884
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,920
Think, boy.
Think of your mother.

885
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:12,160
But what chance could a poor,
misshapen child like you have...

886
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,680
against her heathen treachery?

887
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,800
Well, never you mind,
Quasimodo.

888
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,960
She'll be
out of our lives soon enough.

889
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,120
I will free you
from her evil spell.

890
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,760
She will torment you
no longer.

891
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,680
What do you mean?

892
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,200
I know where her hideout is,
and tomorrow at dawn...

893
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,960
I attack with a thousand men.

894
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,480
We have to find
the Court of Miracles before daybreak.

895
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,360
If Frollo gets there first--

896
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,400
Are you coming with me?

897
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,120
- I can't.
- I thought you were Esmeralda's friend.

898
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,880
Frollo's my master.
I can't disobey him again.

899
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,400
She stood up for you. You've got
a funny way of showing gratitude.

900
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:10,680
Well, l'm not going to sit by and watch
Frollo massacre innocent people.

901
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,320
You do what you think is right.

902
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,800
What? What am l supposed to do?

903
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,360
Go out there and rescue the girl
from the-- from the jaws of death...

904
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,240
and the whole town will cheer
like l'm some kind of a hero?

905
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,880
She already has her knight
in shining armour and it's not me.

906
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,600
Frollo was right.
Frollo was right about everything.

907
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,960
I'm tired of trying to be
something that l'm not.

908
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,640
I must be out of my mind.

909
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,480
Phoebus! Shh.
I'm coming with you.

910
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,680
- Glad you changed your mind.
- I'm not doing it for you.

911
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,040
- I'm doing it for her.
- You know where she is?

912
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,560
No, but she said that this
will help us find her.

913
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:16,440
Good, good, good.
Ah, great. What is it?

914
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,720
- I'm not sure.
- Must be some sort of code.

915
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,560
Maybe it's Arabic. No, no. It's not
Arabic. Maybe it's ancient Greek.

916
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,800
"When you wear this woven band,
you hold the city in your hand."

917
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,320
- What?
- It's the city.

918
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,760
-What are you talking about?
-It's a map.

919
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,760
See. Here's the cathedral
and the rive r...

920
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,040
-and-and-and this little stone must be--
-l've never seen a map that looks like--

921
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,800
Look, l've lived up in the bell tower
for 20 years and l think l know...

922
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,920
- I've been in battles
on four continents.
- what the city looks like from above...

923
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:42,160
- I've got a very good idea what
a map looks like and this is not it.
- and this is it!

924
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,840
All right. Okay. If you say
it's a map, fine. It's a map.

925
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,280
But if we're going to find Esmeralda,
we have to work together.

926
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,960
- Truce?
- Well, okay.

927
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,080
Sorry.

928
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,080
No, you're not.

929
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,960
- This looks like the symbol on the map.
- But what does it mean?

930
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,400
I'm not sure.
I can make out an inscription...

931
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,080
but it's going to take
a few minutes to translate it.

932
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,160
Yes, well. Or-Or we could just,
uh, go down those stairs.

933
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,480
Is this the Court of Miracles?

934
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:40,160
Offhand, l'd say it's
the Court of Ankle-deep Sewage.

935
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,480
Must be the old catacombs.

936
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:50,000
Cheerful place.

937
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,680
Kind of makes ya wish ya got out
more often, eh, Quasi?

938
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,600
Not me. I just want
to warn Esmeralda...

939
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,240
and get back to the bell tower
before l get in any more trouble.

940
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,680
And speaking of trouble,
we should have run into some by now.

941
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,560
- What do you mean?
- You know. A guard. A booby trap.

942
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,400
Or an ambush.

943
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,040
Well, well, well.
What have we here?

944
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:16,440
- Trespassers !
- Spies!

945
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,480
- We're not spies!
- You've got to listen--

946
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,240
Don't interrupt me.

947
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:23,040
You're very clever
to have found our hideaway.

948
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:27,520
Unfortunately, you won't live
to tell the tale.

949
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,440
Maybe you've heard
of a terrible place

950
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,120
Where the scoundrels of Paris
collect in a lair

951
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,400
Maybe you've heard of that mythical
place called the Court of Miracles

952
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,480
- Hello, you're there.
- Where the lame can walk

953
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,680
And the blind can see

954
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,880
But the dead don't talk

955
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,760
So you won't be around
to reveal what you found

956
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,840
We have a method
for spies and intruders

957
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,360
Rather like hornets
protecting their hive

958
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,840
Here in the Court of Miracles

959
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,760
Where it's a miracle
if you get out alive

960
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,280
Gather 'round, everybody.
There's "good noose" tonight.

961
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:05,680
It's a double header.
A couple of Frollo's spies.

962
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,200
And not just any spies.

963
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:12,560
His Captain of the Guard
and his loyal, bell-ringing henchman.

964
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,760
The justice is swift
in the Court of Miracles

965
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,200
I am the lawyers and judge
all in one

966
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,120
We like to get the trial
over with quickly

967
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,680
Because it's the sentence
that's really the fun

968
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,600
Any last words?

969
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,200
That's what they all say.

970
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:30,640
- Now that we've seen all the evidence
- Wait! I object.

971
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:31,920
- Overruled!
- I object!

972
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,880
- Quiet!
- Dang.

973
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,240
We find you totally innocent

974
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:40,200
Which is the worst crime of all

975
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,720
So you're going to hang

976
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,480
Stop!

977
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,800
These men aren't spies.
They're our friends.

978
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,680
- Why didn't they say so?
- We did say so.

979
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,880
This is the soldier
who saved the miller's family...

980
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,200
and Quasimodo helped me
escape the cathedral.

981
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:00,280
We came to warn you. Frollo's coming!
He says he knows where you're hiding...

982
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:04,000
and he's attacking at dawn
with a thousand men.

983
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,760
Then let's waste no time.
We must leave immediately.

984
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,360
You took a terrible risk
coming here.

985
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,080
It may not exactly show,
but we're grateful.

986
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,920
Don't thank me.
Thank Quasimodo.

987
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,440
Without his help, l would never
have found my way here.

988
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,520
Nor would l.

989
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,960
After 20 years of searching...

990
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:40,920
the Court of Miracles
is mine at last.

991
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,600
Dear Quasimodo.

992
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,560
I always knew you would
someday be of use to me.

993
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,760
- No.
- What are you talking about?

994
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:52,800
- Why, he led me right to you, my dear.
- You're a liar.

995
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,560
And look what else
l've caught in my net.

996
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,640
Captain Phoebus,
back from the dead.

997
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:01,680
Another "miracle," no doubt.

998
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,080
I shall remedy that.

999
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,360
There'll be a little bonfire
in the square tomorrow...

1000
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,200
and you're all invited to attend.

1001
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,880
- Lock them up.
- No. Please, Master.

1002
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,560
No, no.

1003
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:24,920
Take him back to the bell tower.
And make sure he stays there.

1004
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:37,880
The prisoner, Esmeralda, has been found
guilty of the crime of witch craft.

1005
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,760
The sentence: death!

1006
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,040
She is innocent!

1007
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:01,360
The time has come, Gypsy.
You stand upon the brink of the abyss.

1008
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,000
Yet even now
it is not too late.

1009
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:09,200
I can save you from the flames
of this world and the next.

1010
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,040
Choose me... or the fire.

1011
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:21,440
The Gypsy, Esmeralda,
has refused to recant.

1012
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:25,280
This evil witch has put the soul
of every citizen in Paris...

1013
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,840
in mortal jeopardy.

1014
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,760
- Come on, Quasi. Snap out of it!
- Your friends are down there.

1015
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:35,680
- It's all my fault.
- Ya gotta break these chains.

1016
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,240
I can't. I tried.
What difference would it make?

1017
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:41,200
- But you can't let Frollo win!
- He already has.

1018
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,720
So, you're givin' up? That's it?

1019
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,400
These chains aren't
what's holding you back, Quasimodo.

1020
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:48,560
Leave me alone.

1021
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:54,360
Okay. Okay, Quasi.
We'll leave you alone.

1022
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,720
After all,
we're only made out of stone.

1023
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,960
We just thought maybe
you were made of something stronger.

1024
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,880
For justice, for Paris...

1025
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,400
and for her own salvation,
it is my sacred duty...

1026
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:14,480
to send this unholy demon...

1027
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,520
back where she belongs.

1028
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,920
No!

1029
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,840
Quasimodo!

1030
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,320
Sanctuary!

1031
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:29,000
Sanctuary!

1032
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,360
Sanctuary!

1033
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:33,960
- Captain.
- Sir?

1034
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,240
Seize the cathedral.

1035
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,400
Don't worry.
You'll be safe here.

1036
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,320
Charge!

1037
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,120
Come back, you cowards!

1038
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:03,560
You men, pick up that beam.
Break down the door.

1039
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,560
Alone at last.

1040
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,160
Citizens of Paris!

1041
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:15,440
Frollo has persecuted our people,
ransacked our city.

1042
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:21,000
And now he has declared war
on Notre Dame herself!

1043
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,160
Will we allow it?

1044
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:36,160
I think the cavalry's here.
Hey, isn't that... Feeble?

1045
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,120
- Doofus.
- Phoebus!

1046
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:47,640
Sorry. Sorry.

1047
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,560
Harder!

1048
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:07,760
I'm-l'm free! I'm free!

1049
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,720
Dang it!

1050
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:22,040
Ready, aim, fire !

1051
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,680
Are you sure
that's how it works?

1052
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,040
Works for me.

1053
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,480
Achilles, sit.

1054
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:42,640
Get off me!

1055
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:45,520
Fly, my pretties! Fly, Fly!

1056
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,800
Put your backs into it!

1057
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,400
Frollo, have you gone mad?

1058
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:30,440
I will not tolerate
this assault on the house of God!

1059
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,600
Silence, you old fool!

1060
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,400
The hunchback and l
have unfinished business to attend to.

1061
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,600
And this time
you will not interfere.

1062
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:43,560
We've done it, Esmeralda!
We've beaten them back!

1063
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,960
Come and see.

1064
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:51,240
Esmeralda, wake up.
You're safe now.

1065
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,880
Esmeralda?

1066
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:58,040
Oh, no.

1067
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,120
Oh, no.

1068
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:53,400
- You killed her.
- It was my duty, horrible as it was.

1069
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,800
I hope you can forgive me.

1070
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,040
There, there, Quasimodo.

1071
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:02,600
I know it hurts,
but now the time has come...

1072
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:06,640
to end your suffering forever.

1073
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,440
Now, now. L--

1074
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:20,520
- Listen to me, Quasimodo.
- No! You listen!

1075
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,720
All my life, you have told me
that the world is a dark, cruel place.

1076
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:27,920
But now l see that the only thing dark
and cruel about it is people like you.

1077
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,320
- Quasimodo?
- Esmeralda!

1078
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:34,320
- She lives.
- No!

1079
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:56,680
Leaving so soon?

1080
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:02,240
Look! Up there.

1081
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,640
Hang on!

1082
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,360
I should have known you'd risk your life
to save that Gypsy witch...

1083
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:25,680
just as your own mother died
trying to save you.

1084
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,200
- What?
- Now l'm going to do...

1085
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:31,720
what l should have done
20 years ago!

1086
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:37,280
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Oh!

1087
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,200
Hold on. Hold on.

1088
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,920
And He shall
smite the wicked...

1089
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:06,760
and plunge them
into the fiery pit!

1090
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,760
Quasimodo! Quasi!

1091
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,240
No!

1092
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,480
Three cheers...

1093
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,040
for Quasimodo!

1094
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,000
So here is a riddle
to guess if you can

1095
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:33,800
Sing the bells Of Notre Dame

1096
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:39,360
What makes a monster
and what makes a man

1097
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:43,000
Sing the bells, bells
bells, bells

1098
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,280
Whatever their pitch
you can feel them bewitch you

1099
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,280
The rich and the ritual knells

1100
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,080
Of the bells

1101
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:56,120
Of Notre

1102
01:20:56,160 --> 01:21:00,840
Dame

1103
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,480
Don't you ever migrate?

1104
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:42,560
Someday

1105
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:46,680
When we are wiser

1106
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:50,800
When the world's older

1107
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,640
When we have learned

1108
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,600
I pray

1109
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:03,800
Someday we may yet live

1110
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:06,440
To live

1111
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:12,520
And let live

1112
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:15,600
Someday

1113
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:19,720
Life will be fairer

1114
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,440
Need will be rarer

1115
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:28,160
And greed will not pay

1116
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,160
Godspeed

1117
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:37,360
This fine millennium

1118
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:41,480
On its way

1119
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:46,960
Let it come someday

1120
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:56,560
Someday

1121
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:00,720
Our fight will be won then

1122
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,880
We'll stand in the sun then

1123
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,200
That bright afternoon

1124
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:13,320
Till then

1125
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:18,840
On days when the sun is gone

1126
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:22,120
We'll hang on

1127
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,680
And we'll wish

1128
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:29,000
Upon the moon

1129
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,960
Whoa-oh

1130
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:34,480
-And some days are dark and dreary
- Dark and dreary

1131
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,640
- Seems we haven't got a prayer
- Haven't we got but a prayer

1132
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:42,840
But a prayer for something better

1133
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:47,720
Is the one thing we all share

1134
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,800
- Someday
- Someday

1135
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,920
- When we are wiser
- When we are wiser

1136
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:59,040
- When the world's older
- When the world is older

1137
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:04,280
- When we have learned
- When we have learned

1138
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:08,880
- I pray someday we may yet
- l pray

1139
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,800
- Let live
- Live

1140
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,640
Let live

1141
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,440
- To live
- To live, to live, to live, to live

1142
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,680
-And let live
-And let live

1143
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,840
Someday

1144
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:28,000
- Life will be fairer
- Life will be fairer

1145
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:32,080
- Need will be rarer
- Need will be rarer

1146
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:37,440
- Greed will not pay
- No, no, no

1147
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,400
- Godspeed
- Godspeed

1148
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:45,680
This fine millennium

1149
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:49,840
Let it come

1150
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:55,640
Wish upon

1151
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:58,080
A moon

1152
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:00,400
One day

1153
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:04,240
Someday

1154
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:12,240
Soon

1155
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,480
- One day
- Someday

1156
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,880
Someday

1157
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,160
Soon

1158
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:56,360
Good night, everybody!
