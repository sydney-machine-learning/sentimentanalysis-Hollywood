If he doesn't get at least half the money,
he may become very violent.

167

Give him the money, Little Enos.

168
00:11:58,004 --> 00:12:00,163

get up in the morning...

-I'm not proud. I'm amazed.
-I declare.

196

I didn't realize this floozy was the same one
as the last one.

197

But I do remember all that trouble,
that poor child being abducted...

No, that ain't my radio.
It's my hemo-gauge that's beeping.

205
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,285
This hemo-gauge and that exercise...

206
00:14:25,374 --> 00:14:29,455

of Tibetan monks.

And just lucky enough,
I saw the advertisement in <i>Screw</i> magazine.

209
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,172
So I sent away for it. Cost me $19.95.

I guess that makes it easier for you...

You saved my life. It was totally unselfish.

I saw the elephant coming for you...

which was stuck in her foot.

-Yeah, they are.

You're pushing the truck to Georgia.

1474
01:38:08,942 --> 01:38:10,734
Come on.

1475
01:38:10,819 --> 01:38:13,488
That's right, you old fart. Go the wrong way.
This way.

1476
01:38:13,571 --> 01:38:16,358
MAN 1: Here we go. Pick it up.
MAN 2: Hold it. Steady.

1477
01:38:16,450 --> 01:38:19,700
BANDIT: If I was Clint Eastwood,
you'd say, "Pick Clint up."

1478
01:38:19,786 --> 01:38:22,871
BANDIT: Doctor, why don't we just keep
driving to Texas...

1479
01:38:22,957 --> 01:38:25,994
and you give her an examination
up in the truck?

1480
01:38:26,086 --> 01:38:30,249
Oh, Jesus. I'm missing my wife so bad!

1481
01:38:30,339 --> 01:38:31,502
[All laughing]

1482
01:38:33,719 --> 01:38:37,135
Do you wanna...him while
we got him down here?

1483
01:38:37,557 --> 01:38:40,843
I was the leading gynaecologist in Pompeii.

1484
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:44,561
[Film crew laughing]

1485
01:38:44,772 --> 01:38:47,478
Snowman! I've had about it all's...

1486
01:38:47,818 --> 01:38:49,063
You dumb Indian.

1487
01:38:49,153 --> 01:38:51,110
Fred, just relax, son.

1488
01:38:51,406 --> 01:38:53,777
It ain't nearly as bad as it looks.

1489
01:38:54,366 --> 01:38:56,774
Get up in there, you son of a bitch!

1490
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:02,659
Get in there, you silly son of a bitch!

1491
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:06,037
BANDIT: You got any diesel fuel?
OWNER: If I had any more diesel fuel...

1492
01:39:06,129 --> 01:39:08,917
I'd have to join that APEC, OPEC.

1493
01:39:09,757 --> 01:39:11,466
BANDIT: I'll give it to you again.

1494
01:39:11,552 --> 01:39:15,004
<i>Do you realize I won</i>
<i>the marksmanship award?</i>

1495
01:39:15,265 --> 01:39:17,174
<i>Your father's ass!</i>

1496
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:20,435
FREDERICO: [Stuttering] Longer than
three months and your mother's ass.

1497
01:39:20,519 --> 01:39:22,098
FREDERICO: But shorter than three years.

1498
01:39:22,231 --> 01:39:25,729
Sure, put her in the truck.
Bounce the "raby" around.

1499
01:39:26,819 --> 01:39:29,392
Don't make no difference.
Put her in the truck.

1500
01:39:29,488 --> 01:39:32,608
Bounce the "raby" around...
Your mother's ass.

1501
01:39:34,828 --> 01:39:38,991
Sure, <i>la signora</i> Charlotte can do
anything she wants.

1502
01:39:39,082 --> 01:39:41,954
Put her in the truck. Bounce the "raby"--

1503
01:39:42,045 --> 01:39:43,953
-Your mother's ass.
-Keep it rolling.

1504
01:39:44,046 --> 01:39:45,754
This lady gonna have a baby...

1505
01:39:45,839 --> 01:39:48,295
and not gonna be moved for 24...

1506
01:39:48,384 --> 01:39:51,421
DIRECTOR: Cut it.
CARRIE: I think we should ask this doctor.

1507
01:39:51,512 --> 01:39:55,297
Do you think we should move Charlotte
or let her rest or what?

1508
01:39:55,392 --> 01:39:59,009
I can't stand it! I'm sorry.

1509
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,647
Okay. Come on.

1510
01:40:00,814 --> 01:40:01,929
Now.

1511
01:40:03,443 --> 01:40:06,112
Well, why don't we ask this doctor here?

1512
01:40:06,195 --> 01:40:10,193
Do you think we should move Charlotte
or let her rest or what?

1513
01:40:11,034 --> 01:40:13,360
The lady gonna have a baby--

1514
01:40:13,454 --> 01:40:16,074
FREDERICO: Cut it.
DIRECTOR: All right. Save it.

1515
01:40:16,164 --> 01:40:19,534
We'll start doing what I do best.
We'll show off.

1516
01:40:20,253 --> 01:40:23,337
CARRIE: When do we get started?
BANDIT: Whenever you like.

1517
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:26,001
CARRIE: Is now too soon?

1518
01:40:26,843 --> 01:40:27,958
No.

1519
01:40:28,178 --> 01:40:31,133
It's all shit. Let's print the first one.
