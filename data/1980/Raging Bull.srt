1
00:02:57,213 --> 00:02:58,976
I remember those cheers,

2
00:02:59,582 --> 00:03:01,174
they still ring in my ears,

3
00:03:01,284 --> 00:03:04,117
and for years
they remain in my thoughts,

4
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,551
'cause one night,

5
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:07,714
I took off my robe,
and what'd I do?

6
00:03:07,824 --> 00:03:09,951
I forgot to wear shorts.

7
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:15,628
I recall every fall,
every hook, every jab,

8
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:18,895
the worst way a guy
can get rid of his flab,

9
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:21,299
as you know,
my life wasn't drab.

10
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:24,139
Though I'd much...

11
00:03:25,174 --> 00:03:27,472
Though I'd rather hear you
cheer when you delve--

12
00:03:27,577 --> 00:03:30,546
Though I'd rather hear you cheer
when I delve into Shakespeare...

13
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,410
"A horse! A horse!
My kingdom for a horse!"

14
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:35,484
I haven't had a winner
in six months.

15
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,124
And though I'm no Olivier,
I would much rather...

16
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:47,822
And though I'm no Olivier,
if he fought Sugar Ray,

17
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,763
he would say that the thing
ain't the ring, it's the play.

18
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:54,268
So, give me a stage where
this bull here can rage,

19
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,339
and though I can fight,
I'd much rather recite.

20
00:03:58,474 --> 00:03:59,998
That's entertainment.

21
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:07,048
That's entertainment.

22
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,777
Jake La Motta
and Jimmy Reeves

23
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:10,352
in the Cleveland Arena.

24
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:13,479
La Motta is undefeated,
but he's well behind on points.

25
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:16,683
The Bronx Bull has taken
a lot of punishment in this bout.

26
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:20,058
Jake is cut around the left eye.
Jimmy Reeves has outboxed him...

27
00:04:20,163 --> 00:04:23,462
Jack, tell me, why the fuck do we
have to come to Cleveland for you

28
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:24,692
to get beaten by a mulignane?

29
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:26,701
Come on, do the fuckin' right thing.

30
00:04:26,803 --> 00:04:28,964
He's got you by the balls,
you're outpointed.

31
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:31,699
You're comin' up for the tenth,
you're gonna have to knock him out.

32
00:04:31,808 --> 00:04:33,969
I want you to bite him, kick him,
do anything you gotta do.

33
00:04:34,076 --> 00:04:35,907
Nobody's lookin',
you know what to do.

34
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:37,980
Just like home--
all over the fuckin' moolies.

35
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,878
Knock the motherfucker out.
You understand? Knock him out.

36
00:04:40,983 --> 00:04:43,247
Hey, you wanna go in there?
You wanna go in and do it?

37
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,416
Help!

38
00:04:50,193 --> 00:04:51,990
We need a knockout,
let's go get a knockout,

39
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:53,061
that's where it's at.

40
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:55,858
Tenth and final round.
Good luck to you both.

41
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:57,990
La Motta fighting
out of a half crouch.

42
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,091
Reeves is up against
a tough fighter,

43
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:02,171
a man who doesn't know
how to back up.

44
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:05,832
La Motta continues to bore in,
out of the bob and weave,

45
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:08,433
hooks a left hand to the jaw,
and Reeves is down!

46
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:12,444
The crowd is urging Jake on.

47
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:16,447
The referee is tolling over Reeves.
He's got to get up.

48
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:19,180
La Motta comes at him once again,
Reeves misses a right,

49
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:22,189
takes a left, and another left,
a hard left hand to the jaw,

50
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,725
and Reeves is down
for the second time.

51
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:28,058
A determined Jake La Motta
is making a great comeback

52
00:05:28,164 --> 00:05:29,631
here in the tenth round.

53
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:33,797
Reeves is up again.
La Motta comes at him.

54
00:05:33,903 --> 00:05:37,066
A left hook to the jaw,
another left, and a right to the body.

55
00:05:37,173 --> 00:05:39,801
Three more lefts to the midsection,
a hook on the jaw,

56
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:42,901
two more lefts to the head,
a right and a left to the jaw.

57
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:45,003
Reeves goes down
for the third time,

58
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:47,378
and the referee
is pulling La Motta away.

59
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:49,474
Two... three...

60
00:05:49,585 --> 00:05:51,075
four... five...

61
00:05:51,187 --> 00:05:53,678
- The referee is counting over Reeves,
- six... seven...

62
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:55,814
- but time is running out...
- eight... nine...

63
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:57,392
...and there is the bell.

64
00:05:58,127 --> 00:06:01,585
He can't walk, but Reeves
has been saved by the bell.

65
00:06:01,697 --> 00:06:03,597
But did La Motta
do it soon enough?

66
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:05,132
Jack, Jack, come here.

67
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:08,101
It's no good.
This is Ohio, not New York!

68
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:10,536
- You waited too long!
- That dumb bastard!

69
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,507
Put the robe on right, huh?
Put my robe on right!

70
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:16,769
Ladies and gentlemen...

71
00:06:18,147 --> 00:06:22,311
...under the rules of
the Ohio Boxing Commission,

72
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:25,053
after ten rounds,

73
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:29,714
the winner,
by unanimous decision,

74
00:06:30,893 --> 00:06:33,691
- Jimmy Reeves!
- The colorful Jake La Motta,

75
00:06:33,796 --> 00:06:36,822
the Bronx Bull,
has lost his first fight.

76
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:44,067
That's Jake's fight!
Come on, that's Jake's fight!

77
00:06:44,173 --> 00:06:45,538
Jake won that fight!

78
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:48,576
Don't leave. Don't get outta
the fuckin' ring. Stay here.

79
00:06:48,678 --> 00:06:51,511
You won-- let him go first.
Stay in, I'm tellin' you.

80
00:06:51,614 --> 00:06:54,310
La Motta floored Reeves
seven times in the fight,

81
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,715
but La Motta still lost the fight.

82
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:03,757
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

83
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:20,933
Help!

84
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:47,325
...on his fuckin' back,
they pick up his arm, he's dead.

85
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:49,927
They tell him he won the fight.
People went crazy.

86
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,974
That shit woulda never happened if
Tommy was there takin' care of it.

87
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:56,306
He's gotta be with Tommy to fight
in New York, to get a title shot.

88
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:58,346
He's gonna wind up
punch-drunk, your brother.

89
00:07:58,447 --> 00:07:59,675
- I know.
- You know.

90
00:07:59,782 --> 00:08:03,240
You gotta make him understand it's
the best thing for everybody involved.

91
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:05,252
- I said I know.
- You know,

92
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:07,982
but you gotta make him know,
make him understand it.

93
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,421
Jesus Christ, you wanna stop?

94
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:11,425
When the fuck
you gonna stop with that stuff?

95
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:13,358
I told ya,
I understand everything.

96
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:15,430
He just wants to do
things for himself.

97
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:17,431
- Hard to understand?
- It's because he's got a head

98
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:19,433
- like concrete.
- You make me laugh.

99
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:21,628
You think it's easy?
Why don't you talk to him?

100
00:08:21,737 --> 00:08:23,534
- You know what to say.
- You know I can't talk to him.

101
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,539
- Why can't you talk to him?
- 'Cause he don't like me.

102
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,302
Nobody likes you,
you oughta be used to it.

103
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:30,371
They knew.

104
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,913
They knew who was the boss.

105
00:08:36,752 --> 00:08:39,380
The judges didn't know. Who knows
what happened with them?

106
00:08:39,922 --> 00:08:41,287
The people knew.

107
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:45,724
You don't believe me, you thought
I was over there foolin' around, huh?

108
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:48,797
You thought I was foolin' around,
didn't ya? Tell me the truth.

109
00:08:48,898 --> 00:08:50,832
I ain't doin' no foolin' around.

110
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:54,096
- That's in your mind.
- Yeah, so what?

111
00:08:54,203 --> 00:08:57,661
That championship belt on me,
that's when I fool around.

112
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:01,734
Is it done?

113
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:04,209
No, it's not done.

114
00:09:04,313 --> 00:09:07,009
Don't overcook it.
You overcook it, it's no good.

115
00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:10,244
It defeats its own purpose.

116
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,084
What are you doin'?
I just said don't overcook it.

117
00:09:17,193 --> 00:09:19,252
You're overcookin' it,
bring it over.

118
00:09:19,361 --> 00:09:21,420
- You want your steak?
- Bring it over.

119
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:23,655
Bring it over!

120
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:26,860
It's like a piece of charcoal!
Bring it over here!

121
00:09:26,969 --> 00:09:29,369
- You want your steak?
- Yeah, right now!

122
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:32,134
Good.
There's your stupid steak.

123
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:34,709
- Can't wait for it to be done?
- No, I can't wait.

124
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,801
Good. Okay? Happy?

125
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:38,470
- Happy?
- That's all I want.

126
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:40,446
That's-- there, no, more. There.

127
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,147
Botherin' me about a steak, huh?
You're botherin' me about a steak?!

128
00:09:45,254 --> 00:09:47,222
I agree with you.
He should be with Tommy.

129
00:09:47,323 --> 00:09:50,156
If he's in a good mood, I'll talk to him.
What the fuck you want me to do?

130
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:52,056
Tommy tells me
every day to talk to you

131
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:53,651
and speak to Jake
to straighten this thing out,

132
00:09:53,763 --> 00:09:55,287
I'm gonna wind up in the middle.

133
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:56,694
You're in the middle?
I'm his brother.

134
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,994
- He's got me fuckin' nuts.
- You're his brother.

135
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:01,467
If you can't talk to him,
who's gonna talk to him?

136
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:05,072
- I'll talk to him.
- Do what you can, that's all.

137
00:10:05,174 --> 00:10:06,903
- That's all I'm askin' you.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

138
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:09,307
- Let me go up.
- All right? Where you gonna be?

139
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:11,402
I'll be at the gym
or the other joint, one of the two.

140
00:10:11,514 --> 00:10:13,414
- I'll catch you by the gym.
- All right. Sal?

141
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:14,505
Yeah?

142
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:19,413
Complain some more,
I wanna hear.

143
00:10:19,522 --> 00:10:22,423
- Complain? You call those carrots?
- That's right.

144
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:24,356
- You call that food?
- You ate 'em. Did you eat them?

145
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,155
You call that food?
I got no choice!

146
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:27,957
- I'm sick of you already!
- I got no choice!

147
00:10:28,063 --> 00:10:31,931
- I can't believe you!
- I got no choice!

148
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:34,594
You got no choice?
Get away from me!

149
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:37,001
- Please!
- Get in there. Get in there!

150
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,700
Get your hands off me,
get away from me!

151
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:41,709
Fuck! I'm sick of you!

152
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:43,836
What's the matter with you,
you animals?

153
00:10:43,946 --> 00:10:45,504
- What?!
- Jack, come on!

154
00:10:45,614 --> 00:10:47,605
- You animals!
- Come on, huh?

155
00:10:47,716 --> 00:10:49,843
This son of a bitch
is callin' me an animal.

156
00:10:49,952 --> 00:10:52,352
- Hey, you!
- Come on, Jack.

157
00:10:52,454 --> 00:10:55,116
I'm gonna get hold of that dog,
and I'm gonna eat it for lunch!

158
00:10:55,224 --> 00:10:57,658
You hear what I'm sayin'?
You hear me, Larry?

159
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,957
- Larry?
- Crazy animal!

160
00:11:01,063 --> 00:11:03,531
Who's an animal?
Your mother's an animal!

161
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:05,497
You son of a bitch!

162
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:08,661
You're gonna find your dog dead
in the hallway tomorrow, ya bum.

163
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:10,238
- I can't take it!
- The whole block,

164
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:12,398
- people could hear you.
- I'll kill the whole family.

165
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:14,066
- Sit down, relax.
- I can't take this anymore!

166
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:16,076
You break anything
in there, I'm gonna kill ya!

167
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:18,976
I swear to God, I'm gonna
come in there and kill ya.

168
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:20,548
Yeah, sure.

169
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,816
You wanna calm down?

170
00:11:26,856 --> 00:11:27,823
Oh, fuck!

171
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:29,984
What'd I do?

172
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:34,162
Come on, honey,
let's be friends.

173
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:37,662
- Truce, all right?
- It's not all right!

174
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:40,267
You can't, I'm telling you--

175
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:43,133
you can't fuckin' eat
and drink like an animal,

176
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:45,503
put up with
this fuckin' brasciole here.

177
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:47,872
You can't do this.
I'm tellin' ya.

178
00:11:47,977 --> 00:11:51,743
Forget about the Reeves thing,
you got a million other fights comin' up.

179
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:53,815
You just can't keep doin' this.

180
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:56,543
What's wrong?

181
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:01,849
Something's the matter,
what's up?

182
00:12:09,498 --> 00:12:11,329
You know what's botherin' me?

183
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:14,294
My hands.

184
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,968
Your hands?
What about 'em?

185
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:23,471
I got these small hands.
I got a little girl's hands.

186
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,706
I got 'em, too.
What's the difference?

187
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,317
Know what that means?

188
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,578
No matter how big I get,
no matter who I fight,

189
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:36,146
no matter what I do,
I ain't never gonna fight Joe Louis.

190
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:39,490
That's right, he's a heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

191
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:42,959
I ain't never gonna get a chance
to fight the best there is.

192
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:45,829
And you know somethin'?
I'm better than them.

193
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:47,869
I ain't never gonna get a chance.

194
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:52,166
You're asking me what's wrong.

195
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,543
You're crazy to even
think about somethin' like that.

196
00:12:57,646 --> 00:12:59,671
He's a fuckin' heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

197
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:03,548
It's impossible, it'll never happen,
so why go crazy thinkin' about it?

198
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:04,778
It's not normal.

199
00:13:08,824 --> 00:13:10,621
Do me a favor.

200
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:13,524
- Yeah, what?
- I want you to hit me in the face.

201
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,094
- What?
- I want you to hit me in the face.

202
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,097
Forget about it.

203
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:21,328
I want you to hit me
in the face, go ahead.

204
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:24,429
- Take your best shot.
- Forget about it, I ain't doin' it.

205
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,974
We have fights all the time--
are you worried now?

206
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:28,202
Hit me in the face.
Go ahead.

207
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,641
- No.
- What, are you afraid?

208
00:13:29,745 --> 00:13:30,734
Afraid of what?

209
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:33,144
Come on, don't be
a little faggot, hit me.

210
00:13:34,183 --> 00:13:37,084
- I ain't a fag.
- Take your best shot, go ahead.

211
00:13:37,186 --> 00:13:40,417
Come on. You gotta be a real jerk,
you want me to punch you in the face.

212
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,591
Did I not tell you just to do it?
Now I'm tellin' you, you gotta do it.

213
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:47,154
I ain't hittin' ya.

214
00:13:47,262 --> 00:13:50,163
I'm your older brother, Joey.
I'm tellin' ya somethin'.

215
00:13:50,265 --> 00:13:52,062
I know what you said.
I ain't doin' it.

216
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:55,837
I don't care if you get mad,
I ain't doin' it.

217
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,506
Fuckin' nut.

218
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:02,435
I'm not doin' it,
I'm not gonna do it.

219
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:06,239
I don't have any gloves. What am I
gonna hit you with, the table?

220
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:08,043
- I ain't doin' it.
- Use that over there.

221
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:11,278
- What?
- That's right, use that.

222
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:15,619
Wrap it around your hand!
How many times I gotta tell you?

223
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,453
- Not too many more.
- Go ahead.

224
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,856
- You want me to hit you?
- I want you to hit me

225
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:22,055
with everything you got. I want you
to fuckin' lay me out, go ahead.

226
00:14:22,164 --> 00:14:23,131
- You sure?
- Yeah.

227
00:14:23,232 --> 00:14:24,494
- Go ahead.
- All right.

228
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,693
- Harder.
- Yeah?

229
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:29,464
You throw a punch like
you take it up the ass, come on.

230
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:31,232
Harder, harder.

231
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,137
- Harder.
- That's hard, you fuck.

232
00:14:33,242 --> 00:14:34,504
- What do you want?
- Take it off.

233
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:37,009
- Take it off.
- Come on, you wanna stop now?

234
00:14:37,112 --> 00:14:38,374
- That's enough with that--
- Take it off.

235
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,606
Come on.

236
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:40,841
- Come on.
- Don't fuck around.

237
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:42,541
- What are you, a girl?
- Oh, girl, huh?

238
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:44,278
I'm gonna smack you again,
throw it again.

239
00:14:44,386 --> 00:14:45,478
- That's enough.
- Go ahead.

240
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:47,384
- I said that's enough!
- Harder, harder.

241
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:50,151
No, your fuckin' cuts
are opening and everything.

242
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:52,785
What are you tryin' to prove?
What does it prove?

243
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:10,406
Hey, Vito.

244
00:15:15,517 --> 00:15:16,950
Joey, what's what?

245
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:19,285
Jake, you're lookin' good.

246
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,854
How you doin'?

247
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:29,593
Don't stay here.

248
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:31,658
Joey.

249
00:15:32,534 --> 00:15:33,660
Come here.

250
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,870
Yeah, he looks mad, huh?

251
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:40,168
Looks mad.

252
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:42,709
Spoke to him yesterday,
I don't know.

253
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:44,745
You told 'em to come up here?

254
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:47,107
Answer me when I talk to you.

255
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:49,013
Yeah, why?
I can't have my friends up here?

256
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:52,313
- I heard this fucker didn't win the fight.
- Take it easy.

257
00:15:52,421 --> 00:15:54,514
Don't ever bring 'em
up here again, hear me?

258
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,590
Hear me? Come on.

259
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:59,828
- Come on!
- They look like two fags over there.

260
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:18,939
We're gonna go,
I'll call you tomorrow, huh?

261
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:24,378
Hey, Jake, watch you
don't hurt yourself.

262
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:29,216
How's your wife?
Is everything okay?

263
00:16:29,324 --> 00:16:31,724
Anybody bothers you,
let me know, okay?

264
00:16:31,827 --> 00:16:33,692
Yeah. Yeah, wave.
They're your friends.

265
00:16:33,795 --> 00:16:36,923
What the fuck is wrong with you?!
You gotta make a fuckin' jerk outta me.

266
00:16:37,032 --> 00:16:40,160
They only came up here 'cause Tommy
told 'em to come up to try to help us.

267
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:43,204
What's the matter with you, help who?
What's the matter with you?

268
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,967
How they gonna help me?
What, by takin' my money?

269
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:50,069
Is that what youse talkin' about,
takin' my money?

270
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:52,272
I'm here breakin' my ass, not them.

271
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:55,279
Don't ever bring 'em
up here again, you hear me?

272
00:16:55,384 --> 00:16:56,442
What are ya,
a jerk there?

273
00:16:56,552 --> 00:16:59,112
I'm a jerk?
You're a fuckin' asshole.

274
00:16:59,221 --> 00:17:01,587
What the fuck

275
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,681
Yeah, yeah,

276
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:05,589
Maybe you can't, huh?

277
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:14,035
Ya fuck!

278
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:31,118
Come on, give me a Coke.

279
00:17:34,423 --> 00:17:37,051
Hey, shove off.
You gonna go to the dance?

280
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:38,719
Go to the dance?

281
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:48,435
- Who's that girl over there?
- The one I was talkin' to?

282
00:17:48,537 --> 00:17:49,504
- Yeah.
- The blond?

283
00:17:49,605 --> 00:17:51,072
- Yeah.
- Vickie, you mean.

284
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:57,143
- Where's she from?
- She's from the neighborhood,

285
00:17:57,246 --> 00:17:59,305
she's a neighborhood girl.

286
00:17:59,414 --> 00:18:01,348
What's her last name?

287
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,942
Vickie, that's all I know.
They call her Vickie.

288
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:08,315
She knows them?

289
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,393
She knows them, they know her,
she comes to the pool every day.

290
00:18:12,494 --> 00:18:15,156
Everybody knows each other--
you know how that shit works.

291
00:18:15,264 --> 00:18:17,391
- She go with them?
- She don't go with nobody.

292
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:19,865
She's 15 years old,
where the fuck's she gonna go?

293
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:21,731
Where ya gonna take her,
the Copacabana?

294
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:24,932
I heard there was
a girl that he went with

295
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,099
that was a very beautiful
young girl, blond.

296
00:18:27,643 --> 00:18:29,941
- Yeah?
- It's not her?

297
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:32,742
I doubt it very much.

298
00:18:32,848 --> 00:18:35,078
What are you
thinkin' about, anyway?

299
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:37,617
She ain't the kinda girl
you just fuck and forget about.

300
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:39,209
Joey, how many times
I gotta tell ya?

301
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:41,846
Why are you always cursin'
when I'm talkin' to you?

302
00:18:41,957 --> 00:18:44,790
Don't do it around me.
Do it around your friends.

303
00:18:44,893 --> 00:18:47,521
- It's that thing, just don't do it.
- All right, she's--

304
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:50,598
The kinda girl you bang
and forget about-- she's not like that.

305
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:53,293
You gotta spend time
with her, get involved.

306
00:18:53,402 --> 00:18:54,630
You know, it's...

307
00:18:56,672 --> 00:18:57,969
D'you bang her?

308
00:18:58,073 --> 00:19:00,132
- No.
- Tell me the truth.

309
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:02,676
I just told you the truth.
I tell you the truth the first time,

310
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:04,746
you don't have to ask me again,
I never do that.

311
00:19:04,846 --> 00:19:07,940
I always tell you the truth.
If I did it, you would know.

312
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:11,381
I took her out
a couple of times.

313
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:13,852
You went with her?
You didn't try to fuck her?

314
00:19:13,955 --> 00:19:16,014
I try to fuck anything,
you know that.

315
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:18,422
- She didn't go with you?
- No, she didn't go for it.

316
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:20,188
- Naturally.
- Naturally?

317
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:22,525
- She knew better.
- What do you mean, she knew better?

318
00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:24,289
She knew you were an animal,

319
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:26,367
she knew it was no good
if you'd go with her.

320
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:28,265
Her reputation would be ruined.

321
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:31,172
I thought he was
talkin' to you, Vickie.

322
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,207
- That's--
- That's the same guy?

323
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:35,037
- Yeah, it's the same guy.
- I gotta break his legs.

324
00:19:35,143 --> 00:19:36,132
He was over here yesterday.

325
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:37,541
- He was here yesterday?
- You missed him.

326
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:40,046
I was up to the house yesterday.
Didn't know he was over here.

327
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:42,446
- You stay in there, I'll go find him.
- No, I can catch him.

328
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:45,543
Your friends, they're in a huddle.
Big business meeting.

329
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:48,613
Come by the pool,
they sit around and talk.

330
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:51,318
Big deals.
They make sure she can hear.

331
00:19:52,494 --> 00:19:55,861
Hey, like the big man.
Get the fuck outta here.

332
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:58,800
Where you goin',
gettin' in the water?

333
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,265
Don't get your hair wet.

334
00:20:03,505 --> 00:20:04,631
Big shot.

335
00:20:06,174 --> 00:20:08,972
Get him alone in the back room,
smack him around, no more big shot--

336
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:10,374
without his gun.

337
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:14,311
Yeah, real tough guys.

338
00:20:16,184 --> 00:20:19,153
- They're all tough guys.
- What are you thinkin' about?

339
00:20:19,254 --> 00:20:22,815
Keep lookin'. Where the fuck you goin'?
You're dead, you're married.

340
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:26,826
You're a married man, it's all over.
Leave the young girls for me.

341
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,325
Big shot.

342
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:40,000
Let's get outta here.
You gonna stay here all night?

343
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:41,234
We'll never get through.

344
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:43,570
Where the hell do you think
you're goin' at this hour?

345
00:20:43,678 --> 00:20:45,669
What are you, a cop?
I'm goin' out. Business.

346
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:47,840
Fuckin' worm.
You go out, I'm goin' out.

347
00:20:47,949 --> 00:20:49,576
Do what you're gonna do,
what do I care?

348
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:50,651
Run out, see if I care.

349
00:20:50,752 --> 00:20:52,515
I'm not gonna be here
when you get back!

350
00:20:52,621 --> 00:20:53,747
Fuckin' bunch of guineas.

351
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:55,322
- You're always hangin' out together!
- Why don't you stop already?

352
00:20:55,424 --> 00:20:57,449
Why don't you fuckin' stop?
You're not goin' on business.

353
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,789
- You're goin' to suck each other off!
- Why don't you have some respect?

354
00:20:59,895 --> 00:21:02,125
- The whole buildin' hears ya.
- Suck him! Suck him, baby!

355
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,666
Hey, Larry! Now you got
somethin' to talk about

356
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:08,133
with that fuckin' dog,
and this one up there.

357
00:21:08,236 --> 00:21:10,363
Fuckin' Jew cunt, why don't you
hit her in the head with a bat?

358
00:21:10,472 --> 00:21:11,905
Don't call her no names,
she's still my wife.

359
00:21:12,007 --> 00:21:13,770
- How much abuse you wanna take?
- I hit her enough.

360
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,467
- What am I supposed to do?
- Kill the fuck.

361
00:21:15,577 --> 00:21:17,977
Go ahead!
Just leave me here like a dog!

362
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,877
You and your fuckin' ass--
you, too ya-- go out!

363
00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:23,610
- What's the matter with you?!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

364
00:21:23,718 --> 00:21:25,083
- You gotta leave me here?!
- You let the whole block hear you.

365
00:21:25,187 --> 00:21:28,088
- What's the matter with you?!
- I could give a shit, ya fuckin' queer!

366
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,851
- Faggot! Go stick it up his ass!
- What'd you say?!

367
00:21:37,332 --> 00:21:39,459
Oh! Beans!

368
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:42,662
Jack.

369
00:21:50,545 --> 00:21:52,979
Beansy got a table in the back,
he said we could sit with them.

370
00:21:53,081 --> 00:21:54,605
Beansy who?
Which Beansy?

371
00:21:54,716 --> 00:21:56,377
- Huh?
- Beansy who?

372
00:21:56,485 --> 00:21:58,112
Beans, you know,
he's one of the guys.

373
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,450
- You'll know him when you see him.
- She'll be over there?

374
00:22:00,555 --> 00:22:02,955
I don't know, but you could see
from there, at least.

375
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:06,459
- Come on, let's go.
- I don't wanna look too hard.

376
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,728
- Hello, Joe, how you doin'?
- Beansy, what is it?

377
00:22:16,838 --> 00:22:17,827
Thanks for the seats.

378
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:20,271
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey, what's up? Hey.

379
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,640
Nothing. I got trouble with these two
motherfuckin' greaseballs downstairs,

380
00:22:23,745 --> 00:22:26,145
- they got me crazy.
- Hello, Father, how ya doin'?

381
00:22:26,248 --> 00:22:28,580
- Hey, Father, what is it?
- Oh, ho, Father!

382
00:22:28,683 --> 00:22:30,446
You wanna get laid?
You sure?

383
00:22:30,552 --> 00:22:32,986
- You sure?
- Hey, no, no.

384
00:22:33,088 --> 00:22:35,716
Father, where you goin'?
Bless the table, give us a shot.

385
00:22:36,424 --> 00:22:38,551
D'you put money
in the basket this week?

386
00:22:57,546 --> 00:22:59,343
- You see her right there?
- I saw, I saw.

387
00:22:59,447 --> 00:23:00,744
- Okay?
- I saw.

388
00:23:05,987 --> 00:23:08,046
- They're goin' with her.
- Don't worry about them, go ahead.

389
00:23:08,156 --> 00:23:09,123
Go ahead.

390
00:23:56,037 --> 00:23:58,267
Get the fuck out,
you greaseball bastard!

391
00:23:58,373 --> 00:23:59,840
Get out! Get out!

392
00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:01,238
You, too, get out.

393
00:24:01,343 --> 00:24:04,039
Get outta here,
ya fuckin' bum, ya!

394
00:24:04,145 --> 00:24:06,545
- Rotten bastards!
- Go back where you came from.

395
00:24:09,818 --> 00:24:10,944
Hey, Vickie!

396
00:24:20,328 --> 00:24:21,852
- Hi, Joey.
- How you doin'?

397
00:24:21,963 --> 00:24:24,898
- I'm all right, what are you doin'?
- Nothin' much, what are you doin'?

398
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,094
- That your car?
- No, it's my brother's.

399
00:24:28,203 --> 00:24:29,795
D'you ever meet my brother?

400
00:24:29,904 --> 00:24:32,702
- No, Is that him?
- Yeah. Wanna meet him?

401
00:24:33,908 --> 00:24:36,138
- All right.
- Hey, Jack!

402
00:24:38,513 --> 00:24:39,639
There.

403
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:51,418
Vickie, this is my brother Jake.
He's gonna be the next champ.

404
00:24:51,526 --> 00:24:52,652
Hi.

405
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:54,487
How you doin'?

406
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:58,158
Nice to meet you.

407
00:25:01,536 --> 00:25:04,937
- Nice car.
- You like that car?

408
00:25:05,473 --> 00:25:06,906
Yeah. It's nice.

409
00:25:16,985 --> 00:25:18,111
Where you from?

410
00:25:19,621 --> 00:25:20,747
Around here.

411
00:25:23,158 --> 00:25:24,819
You wanna go for a ride?

412
00:25:27,829 --> 00:25:31,629
All right. Gotta give me a few minutes,
I have to change, okay?

413
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:33,960
- All right?
- All right.

414
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:35,593
- I'll be back in a little while
- I'll be over there.

415
00:25:35,704 --> 00:25:36,830
Okay.

416
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,306
Move over.

417
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:01,255
- I never played this game.
- Go ahead.

418
00:26:01,362 --> 00:26:04,820
It's the only way you're gonna learn.
Here, I'll show you how to do it.

419
00:26:07,302 --> 00:26:08,701
That's the way, that's right.

420
00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:09,929
- Like this?
- Yeah, that's right.

421
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:11,699
- Hit it?
- Just hit it nice.

422
00:26:11,806 --> 00:26:13,205
Hit the middle one.

423
00:26:26,654 --> 00:26:27,780
You see it?

424
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:30,817
No.

425
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:48,141
What does that mean?

426
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:51,144
It means the game is over.

427
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,477
Come on, let's go.

428
00:26:56,518 --> 00:26:57,815
Daddy?

429
00:27:05,293 --> 00:27:07,591
Dad?
Come on in.

430
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,564
Probably went shoppin'
or somethin', let me see.

431
00:27:21,976 --> 00:27:24,467
Yeah, he must have
went shoppin'. Sit down.

432
00:27:29,317 --> 00:27:31,285
- You want somethin' to eat?
- No.

433
00:27:31,386 --> 00:27:33,183
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:27:43,832 --> 00:27:45,129
Salute.

435
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:04,576
Why don't you sit over here?
Sit a little closer.

436
00:28:05,954 --> 00:28:08,752
You're so far away, like you're
on the other side of the room.

437
00:28:27,642 --> 00:28:29,837
Come here,
come here.

438
00:28:29,944 --> 00:28:31,912
Come here.
Sit over here.

439
00:28:32,013 --> 00:28:33,776
Come on,
come up from there.

440
00:28:38,653 --> 00:28:39,711
That's better.

441
00:28:43,491 --> 00:28:45,322
No, thank you anyway.

442
00:28:47,495 --> 00:28:48,826
Some water?

443
00:28:59,173 --> 00:29:01,004
Wanna see the rest
of the place?

444
00:29:02,277 --> 00:29:03,335
All right.

445
00:29:03,444 --> 00:29:05,912
I bought it for my father.
I bought the building.

446
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:07,140
Oh, yeah?

447
00:29:08,783 --> 00:29:11,581
- From fightin'?
- Yeah.

448
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:14,247
What else?

449
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:23,760
This is the dining room.

450
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:27,434
That's a bird.

451
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:30,003
It was a bird.
It's dead now, I think.

452
00:29:43,651 --> 00:29:44,777
The restroom.

453
00:29:53,494 --> 00:29:54,483
Sit down.

454
00:30:15,516 --> 00:30:18,144
That's me and my brother.
We were foolin' around.

455
00:30:18,252 --> 00:30:19,549
I know.

456
00:30:21,022 --> 00:30:22,353
You look good, though.

457
00:30:28,863 --> 00:30:30,330
What are you smilin' about?

458
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:32,325
I don't know.

459
00:30:38,873 --> 00:30:40,670
You know how beautiful you are?

460
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,507
Anybody ever tell you
how beautiful you are?

461
00:30:44,612 --> 00:30:46,375
Yeah, they tell you
all the time.

462
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:26,418
Sugar Ray Robinson
and Jake La Motta in Detroit

463
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:27,749
for their second fight.

464
00:31:27,855 --> 00:31:29,823
The undefeated Sugar Ray
defeated Jake

465
00:31:29,924 --> 00:31:32,484
at Madison Square Garden
last October.

466
00:31:33,194 --> 00:31:35,162
You can see the contrast
in their styles--

467
00:31:35,263 --> 00:31:38,426
the speedy Ray Robinson
up on his toes, the dancing master.

468
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:41,559
La Motta the brawler
moves in flat-footed most of the time.

469
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:43,466
Now he's hurt Robinson.

470
00:31:45,273 --> 00:31:46,831
La Motta coming
at Robinson again,

471
00:31:46,941 --> 00:31:49,034
both hands to the head,
a left and a right to the jaw.

472
00:31:49,143 --> 00:31:51,873
A hard left hand to the body
thrown by La Motta.

473
00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:55,745
Round 8, and it's anybody's fight
at this point. 10-rounder.

474
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,910
La Motta drives both hands
to the head, hurts Robinson again.

475
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,511
Hooks the left hand to the jaw,
a right to the body.

476
00:32:02,056 --> 00:32:03,956
Robinson comes back
with a right on the nose.

477
00:32:04,058 --> 00:32:07,186
La Motta drives him across
the ring, a left and a right to the head.

478
00:32:07,295 --> 00:32:10,196
A hard left hand to the body,
and Robinson is driven out of the ring

479
00:32:10,298 --> 00:32:12,357
for the first knockdown of his career.

480
00:32:13,468 --> 00:32:16,596
This is the nearest
Robinson has been to a loss.

481
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:29,414
The fight nears its end.
La Motta has taken charge of the fight.

482
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:32,816
The undefeated Sugar Ray--
his winning ways are in jeopardy.

483
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,048
La Motta coming at him again.
La Motta, feigning a left hand.

484
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:47,091
After ten rounds,

485
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:51,069
Judge Rossi,
8-2, La Motta.

486
00:32:52,373 --> 00:32:56,070
Judge Murphy,
7-3, La Motta.

487
00:32:56,878 --> 00:32:59,847
La Motta has won the fight!

488
00:32:59,947 --> 00:33:01,778
A unanimous decision
for the Bronx Bull.

489
00:33:01,883 --> 00:33:04,408
Jake La Motta handing
Sugar Ray Robinson

490
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:08,216
his first loss as a professional,
and Robinson doesn't like it.

491
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:11,485
With this stunning victory,
La Motta broke what was considered

492
00:33:11,592 --> 00:33:14,527
the impossible--
the invincible Sugar Ray's record.

493
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:16,790
La Motta has proved himself
a great fighter,

494
00:33:16,898 --> 00:33:19,423
and he shouldn't be denied a shot
at the middleweight crown.

495
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:26,470
You sure we should be doin' this?

496
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:28,399
Come here.

497
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:30,977
You said never to touch you
before a fight.

498
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:35,311
Come here,
before I give you a beatin'.

499
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:37,816
You said I couldn't.
You've been good for two weeks.

500
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:39,812
Come here.

501
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:51,324
Come here.

502
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:01,372
Touch my boo-boos.

503
00:34:08,716 --> 00:34:09,808
"Boo-ba?"

504
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:12,784
Boo-boo.
Give the boo-boo a kiss.

505
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:14,784
Make it better.

506
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:32,328
Take off my pants.

507
00:34:33,841 --> 00:34:35,638
You know how to
take off my pants?

508
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,225
Now take off the rest.

509
00:34:56,364 --> 00:34:59,299
You made me promise
not to get you excited.

510
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,526
Go ahead, do it.

511
00:35:17,818 --> 00:35:19,445
Take off your panties.

512
00:36:07,268 --> 00:36:08,735
I like the gym smell.

513
00:36:10,104 --> 00:36:11,093
What?

514
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:15,506
I like the smell of the gym.

515
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:45,297
No, no, no, no.
Enough, enough.

516
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:48,641
I can't do any more.
If I do any more, I'll sink it.

517
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:53,306
I gotta fight Robinson,
I can't fool around.

518
00:37:25,813 --> 00:37:26,837
What are you doin'?

519
00:37:26,947 --> 00:37:29,074
What are you doin'?
What are you doin' to me?

520
00:38:05,886 --> 00:38:07,683
Jake La Motta
and Sugar Ray Robinson

521
00:38:07,788 --> 00:38:09,119
meet for the third time.

522
00:38:09,223 --> 00:38:12,624
These men are unique,
becoming classic rivals.

523
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:15,354
These two men--
fierce, powerful fighters,

524
00:38:15,463 --> 00:38:18,796
dangerous-- so much so that
no other fighter will go near them.

525
00:38:18,899 --> 00:38:21,834
And so, they fight each other,
three weeks apart.

526
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:23,267
They've each won one,

527
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,601
and they'll probably fight again,
the way it looks now.

528
00:38:27,374 --> 00:38:29,672
They go to close quarters at the bell.

529
00:38:34,582 --> 00:38:37,210
Round 7,
with Sugar Ray well ahead on points,

530
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:39,115
La Motta may need a knockout.

531
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:42,049
The left hook to the jaw,

532
00:38:42,156 --> 00:38:45,148
and Robinson is down
for the second time in his career.

533
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:47,454
He was down
in the last fight, too.

534
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:50,826
La Motta watches Sugar Ray
take the count from the referee.

535
00:38:50,931 --> 00:38:53,593
- Robinson trying to get up.
- ...six... seven...

536
00:38:53,701 --> 00:38:55,931
- eight...
- He's up on his feet now,

537
00:38:56,036 --> 00:38:59,028
and the referee is wiping off
his gloves. He is stunned.

538
00:39:00,307 --> 00:39:01,797
La Motta comes at him.

539
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:05,242
Despite being knocked down,
Robinson is well ahead on points.

540
00:39:05,346 --> 00:39:09,043
He hooks a left to the jaw, a left
and a right to the head by Robinson.

541
00:39:10,618 --> 00:39:12,415
Your attention, fans.

542
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,181
Judge Joe Lanahan

543
00:39:14,288 --> 00:39:18,088
scores it 8-1, 1-even,

544
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:20,752
in favor
of Sugar Ray Robinson!

545
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:22,089
Boo! Boo!

546
00:39:22,196 --> 00:39:25,097
A big vote
for Sugar Ray Robinson.

547
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,430
...of 6-2, and 2-even,

548
00:39:28,536 --> 00:39:31,972
for the winner
by unanimous decision,

549
00:39:32,072 --> 00:39:35,564
Sugar Ray Robinson!

550
00:39:36,176 --> 00:39:38,144
Cocksuckers!
I'd like to fuckin'--

551
00:39:42,016 --> 00:39:45,315
- For Christ's sake!
- I'll kill those cocksuckers!

552
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,878
They only gave him
that fuckin' decision

553
00:39:47,988 --> 00:39:50,582
'cause he's goin' in the Army
next week, that's the only reason.

554
00:39:50,691 --> 00:39:53,455
I knocked him down,
I don't know what else I gotta do.

555
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:56,086
- What the hell I gotta do?
- You won and they robbed ya!

556
00:39:56,196 --> 00:39:58,562
They're miserable,
because their mothers take it up

557
00:39:58,666 --> 00:40:00,190
the fuckin' ass, that's why!

558
00:40:02,169 --> 00:40:05,605
I've done a lot of bad things, Joey.
Maybe it's comin' back to me.

559
00:40:06,874 --> 00:40:09,741
Who knows? I'm a jinx, maybe.
Who the hell knows?

560
00:40:09,944 --> 00:40:12,105
Forget about all that shit--
this was your shot.

561
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,841
They robbed us!
They out and out robbed us!

562
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:18,180
- It's Vickie, you wanna talk to her?
- I don't wanna talk to nobody.

563
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:22,621
- Joey, take her home.
- All right.

564
00:40:28,662 --> 00:40:30,994
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

565
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:32,258
You sure?

566
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:34,891
- Make sure she's all right.
- All right.

567
00:43:58,705 --> 00:44:02,266
Yeah, child. I am coming back and bash
you on your head one more time.

568
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,505
Don't ever do
that Janiro bullshit again,

569
00:44:04,611 --> 00:44:06,670
no more deals like that,
you hear what I'm sayin'?

570
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,714
- What are you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about?

571
00:44:08,816 --> 00:44:11,046
Look at that-- 168 pounds.

572
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:13,346
- Stop eatin'.
- What's with the smart answers?

573
00:44:13,453 --> 00:44:15,614
I told ya I didn't wanna do it
in the first place, didn't I?

574
00:44:15,722 --> 00:44:16,814
No, you didn't say that.

575
00:44:16,924 --> 00:44:19,825
You're the one that told me
you could get down to 155 pounds.

576
00:44:19,927 --> 00:44:21,792
Where'd I get it?
Did I pull it out of the fuckin' air?

577
00:44:21,895 --> 00:44:23,726
I don't know if I'm gonna
make it down to 155.

578
00:44:23,831 --> 00:44:25,890
I'm lucky I make it to 160.

579
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:28,365
And on top of that,
you sign me for a fight at 155,

580
00:44:28,468 --> 00:44:31,460
and If I don't make
the 155, I lose $15,000?!

581
00:44:31,572 --> 00:44:33,733
- That's right.
- You're supposed to be a manager!

582
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:35,365
You're supposed to know
what you're doin'.

583
00:44:35,475 --> 00:44:38,376
- I did just what I wanted to do.
- That's what I'm worried about, you--

584
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:40,070
- You want a title shot?
- What are ya talkin' about?

585
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,240
- Do you want a title shot?
- What am I, in a circus over here?

586
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,875
I ask him, he's got more sense
about this. What are you doin'?

587
00:44:45,986 --> 00:44:48,250
You been killin' yourself
for three years now, right?

588
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:52,655
There's nobody's left for you to fight.
Everybody's afraid to fight you.

589
00:44:52,759 --> 00:44:55,159
Along comes this kid Janiro.
He don't know any better.

590
00:44:55,262 --> 00:44:57,787
He's a young kid, up and comin',
he'll fight anybody.

591
00:44:57,898 --> 00:44:59,160
Good, you fight him.

592
00:44:59,266 --> 00:45:02,599
Bust his hole. Tear him apart.
What are you worried about?

593
00:45:02,703 --> 00:45:04,364
What's the biggest thing
you got to worry about?

594
00:45:04,471 --> 00:45:06,336
- I'm worried about the weight.
- You're worried about the weight?

595
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,340
What we arguin' for?
I just said the weight.

596
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:10,808
Let's say you lose
because of your weight.

597
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:12,606
Are they gonna think
you're not as tough as you were?

598
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:14,442
You're not the same fighter?

599
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:16,277
Good. They'll match you
with all those guys

600
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:18,146
they were afraid to match
you with you before.

601
00:45:18,252 --> 00:45:21,380
What happens? You'll kill 'em.
And they gotta give you a title shot.

602
00:45:21,488 --> 00:45:24,582
- Bring me coffee, please.
- Why? There's nobody else.

603
00:45:24,691 --> 00:45:25,715
Nobody's left.

604
00:45:25,826 --> 00:45:27,885
- Who they gonna give it to?
- Coffee.

605
00:45:27,995 --> 00:45:28,962
- In a minute.
- You listenin' to me?

606
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:31,326
- Please, honey, bring me the coffee.
- All right, just a minute.

607
00:45:31,431 --> 00:45:34,696
- How long I gotta wait?!
- Are you listenin'?

608
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:37,326
Now let's say you win,
you beat Janiro.

609
00:45:37,437 --> 00:45:40,133
Which you definitely
should beat him, right?

610
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,468
- Yeah.
- Right?

611
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:42,633
- Yeah.
- They still gotta give you

612
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:45,041
a shot at the title.
You know why?

613
00:45:45,145 --> 00:45:46,669
- Why?
- 'Cause the same thing as before,

614
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,975
there's nobody left,
there ain't nobody around.

615
00:45:49,082 --> 00:45:50,447
They gotta give you the shot.

616
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,745
Ya understand?
If you win, you win.

617
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:54,445
If you lose, you still win.

618
00:45:54,554 --> 00:45:57,318
There's no way you can lose,
and you do it on your own,

619
00:45:57,424 --> 00:45:59,984
just the way you wanted to do it,
without help from anybody.

620
00:46:00,093 --> 00:46:03,585
Ya understand? Just get down
to 155 pounds, ya fat bastard.

621
00:46:03,697 --> 00:46:07,326
Stop eatin'. What's the problem?
Stop eatin', that's all, you can do it.

622
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:09,334
You don't understand anything,
do you understand that?

623
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:11,666
Joey's right, this Janiro
is an up-and-coming fighter,

624
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:13,330
he's good-lookin', he's popular.

625
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,408
- You beat him now--
- Excuse me, what do you mean,

626
00:46:15,509 --> 00:46:17,443
- good-lookin'?
- I'm not sayin' good-lookin',

627
00:46:17,544 --> 00:46:19,944
- I'm sayin' popular. If you win--
- But what were you just sayin'

628
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:21,537
- about good-lookin', popular?
- I'm not sayin' anything.

629
00:46:21,648 --> 00:46:24,845
- I'm just tellin' you Joey's right.
- Are you an authority, or what?

630
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:26,749
- Nothin'--
- Get outta here.

631
00:46:26,853 --> 00:46:29,879
Get outta here.
Take the baby and get outta here.

632
00:46:31,325 --> 00:46:33,486
Everybody all of a sudden's
an authority about this.

633
00:46:33,593 --> 00:46:36,528
Where'd she find out
he's good-lookin', first of all?

634
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:37,858
She didn't mean nothin'.

635
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:42,234
Who asked you?

636
00:46:42,336 --> 00:46:43,997
You gonna start with me now?

637
00:46:44,104 --> 00:46:46,072
When people are talkin',
you don't interrupt.

638
00:46:46,173 --> 00:46:49,802
It's none of your business, especially
if it's my brother and his wife.

639
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:51,275
Ain't got nothin' to do with you.

640
00:46:51,378 --> 00:46:53,972
Get outta here, go inside.
Take the baby inside.

641
00:46:54,081 --> 00:46:57,414
Come on. Let's leave
the grouches here, okay?

642
00:46:57,517 --> 00:47:00,077
- Come on.
- Change her diapers, can't you see?

643
00:47:00,187 --> 00:47:02,951
- She's gonna cry, she stinks.
- You make her cry.

644
00:47:03,523 --> 00:47:06,981
- I'm gonna make you cry.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. Come on.

645
00:47:10,864 --> 00:47:13,162
- They're a couple of babies.
- 155 pounds--

646
00:47:13,266 --> 00:47:15,200
let's go to the training camp.

647
00:47:15,302 --> 00:47:18,601
No distractions,
no wives, no phone calls.

648
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:21,503
Nobody around to bother you.
I'll write out your usual schedule,

649
00:47:21,608 --> 00:47:24,270
- your usual diet--
- Listen, I wanna ask you somethin'.

650
00:47:24,378 --> 00:47:27,279
When I'm away, you ever notice
anything funny goin' on with her?

651
00:47:27,381 --> 00:47:29,110
- With who, Vickie?
- Yeah.

652
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:30,547
Like what?

653
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:32,618
What do you think I mean?

654
00:47:33,487 --> 00:47:35,785
No, I don't notice anything.

655
00:47:35,889 --> 00:47:37,948
I want you to keep
an eye on her, all right?

656
00:47:38,058 --> 00:47:40,026
For what, Jack?
She don't do anything wrong.

657
00:47:40,127 --> 00:47:42,925
I want you to keep an eye
on her when I'm away, all right?

658
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:45,965
You just start trouble for nothin',
I'm tellin' ya, you're crackin' up.

659
00:47:46,066 --> 00:47:47,397
I got a reason, right?

660
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:50,163
You and I both know,
any woman, given the right time,

661
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:53,137
the right place, the right circumstances,
they'll do anything, right?

662
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,731
I mean, anything's possible.
All right?

663
00:47:55,842 --> 00:47:57,070
- You're right.
- You oughta know.

664
00:47:57,177 --> 00:48:00,510
You're not wrong, but you're pickin'
on this girl, 'cause I saw you before.

665
00:48:00,614 --> 00:48:02,241
You're worried about your weight,
you're gettin' aggravated,

666
00:48:02,349 --> 00:48:05,910
and you tell her, "What are you--?
Go inside. Who asked ya?"

667
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:08,487
Botherin' her for that, you're gonna
give her an excuse to go out.

668
00:48:09,189 --> 00:48:11,680
- She was talkin' about a guy.
- So?

669
00:48:11,792 --> 00:48:13,987
So what? She was talkin'
on your behalf, she wasn't--

670
00:48:14,094 --> 00:48:17,063
On my behalf? She was talkin' about
a pretty kid, sayin' he's good-lookin'.

671
00:48:17,164 --> 00:48:18,222
What are you talkin' about?

672
00:48:18,331 --> 00:48:20,026
So you make him ugly,
what's the difference?

673
00:48:20,133 --> 00:48:21,395
- That's why?
- Never mind, just do it.

674
00:48:21,501 --> 00:48:22,468
All right.

675
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,939
You know what you should do?
Go inside and be nice to her.

676
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,598
Make up with her.

677
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:30,801
Tell her you're gonna
take her out, we'll go out.

678
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:32,674
You wanna go out before
you go away, don't you?

679
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:34,178
This way, you go away
with a clear head.

680
00:48:34,281 --> 00:48:35,270
You know you took her out,

681
00:48:35,382 --> 00:48:37,680
you wined and dined her,
you had a good time.

682
00:48:37,784 --> 00:48:38,751
All right?

683
00:48:39,286 --> 00:48:41,880
All right.
Where do you wanna go?

684
00:48:41,988 --> 00:48:44,548
- Well, "out" out, you know.
- All right.

685
00:48:44,658 --> 00:48:47,957
Listen, though, if you tell her now,
pull her on the side.

686
00:48:48,061 --> 00:48:50,222
Don't say nothin'
in front of Lenore...

687
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:52,321
- 'cause I'm not takin' her.
- It's on your head.

688
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:54,593
- All right.
- We can go without her.

689
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:57,534
- Do what you're gonna do.
- Oh, I am.

690
00:49:02,142 --> 00:49:03,268
Come here.

691
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:30,536
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

692
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:32,764
it's great to be back
in the Copa Lounge.

693
00:49:32,873 --> 00:49:34,204
What a great audience.

694
00:49:34,307 --> 00:49:37,276
Come on, lady, laugh it up--
I laughed when you come in.

695
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:42,206
But seriously speakin', folks,
we have a special guest with us tonight.

696
00:49:42,315 --> 00:49:46,217
I'd like to introduce the world's
leading middleweight contender,

697
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:49,015
the Bronx Bull,
the raging bull.

698
00:49:49,122 --> 00:49:52,614
Let's hear it for the great
Jake La Motta, ladies and gentlemen.

699
00:49:58,431 --> 00:49:59,830
What's your name again?

700
00:49:59,933 --> 00:50:02,424
- Janet.
- Janet, sorry, yeah, just been...

701
00:50:03,069 --> 00:50:05,333
It's, uh, toast time.

702
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,438
He hits me with a left hook--
no hand, just a hook he had.

703
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:14,977
- Where you goin'?
- Goin' to the bathroom.

704
00:50:19,419 --> 00:50:20,784
Hey, Vickie.

705
00:50:20,887 --> 00:50:22,548
- Hi.
- Gee, you're lookin' great.

706
00:50:22,656 --> 00:50:23,816
- Thanks.
- Joe here?

707
00:50:23,924 --> 00:50:25,391
Yeah, they're over there.
Jake's here, too.

708
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:27,221
That's great.
Listen, I'm over here

709
00:50:27,327 --> 00:50:28,817
with Tommy
and some of the old gang.

710
00:50:28,929 --> 00:50:30,419
You get a chance,
come over and have a drink.

711
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,656
See ya later.

712
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:37,393
- Hello, Jake, how are you?
- How you doin'?

713
00:50:37,504 --> 00:50:39,062
You're not drinkin', are ya?

714
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:42,835
- Joey, how are ya?
- How you doin', Sal?

715
00:50:42,943 --> 00:50:45,173
Look like you're havin'
a ball over here.

716
00:50:45,278 --> 00:50:46,404
I'm over there with Tommy Como.

717
00:50:46,513 --> 00:50:47,707
Why don't you come over
and have a drink?

718
00:50:47,814 --> 00:50:50,374
Tommy's here?
I didn't even see him come in.

719
00:50:50,483 --> 00:50:52,041
Charlie Rocks,
what are we gonna do here?

720
00:50:52,152 --> 00:50:53,813
What you got?
What's the odds?

721
00:50:58,158 --> 00:50:59,750
I'll see you later, Joey.

722
00:51:00,393 --> 00:51:03,021
Hey, that's some suit.
He looks good, huh, Jack?

723
00:51:05,899 --> 00:51:08,595
I thought that was my best joke.

724
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,637
Rita, Look who's here.

725
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:17,209
Hi, Vickie.

726
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:18,436
Hey, Vickie.

727
00:51:18,545 --> 00:51:20,843
- Say hello to Tommy.
- How are ya, honey?

728
00:51:20,947 --> 00:51:23,814
Good to see ya.
Say hello to Charlie.

729
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:26,010
- Sit down, have a drink.
- I can't, I have to get back to Jake.

730
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:29,850
- I just came by to say hello.
- All right, honey, thanks for comin' by.

731
00:51:29,956 --> 00:51:33,756
- Not a bad kid, that Vickie, ya know.
- She's with that fuckin' gorilla.

732
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,725
She must've caught
a hundred beatin's off that guy.

733
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:42,565
- What took ya so long?
- I went by Tommy's table to say hello.

734
00:51:42,669 --> 00:51:45,900
I saw you say hello to them all.
But what took ya so long?

735
00:51:46,673 --> 00:51:49,836
Nothin', I said hello.
I came back.

736
00:51:50,443 --> 00:51:53,412
- What else did you say?
- He asked me if I wanted a drink.

737
00:51:53,513 --> 00:51:56,482
I said, "No, Jake and Joey
are over there," and I left.

738
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:58,676
What were you talkin' to Salvy for?

739
00:51:59,386 --> 00:52:01,616
He asked me if Joey was there,
I said, "He's over there."

740
00:52:01,721 --> 00:52:04,849
Then he said, "Tommy's over there,
why don't you go say hello?" And I did.

741
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:07,686
Are you interested in him?

742
00:52:07,794 --> 00:52:09,785
No, why would I be
interested in him?

743
00:52:09,896 --> 00:52:11,796
You sure you're not interested in him?

744
00:52:11,898 --> 00:52:12,865
Yeah.

745
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:16,862
In other words, you're not interested
in him, but you could be interested

746
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:20,337
- in somebody?
- Jake, don't start.

747
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,568
What do you gotta--? Hey, shut up,
or I'm gonna smack you in the face.

748
00:52:23,677 --> 00:52:25,372
You embarrass me.

749
00:52:25,478 --> 00:52:28,106
These are from Mr. Como.

750
00:52:31,851 --> 00:52:33,182
Shall I take the...?

751
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,612
- What?
- Should I take this?

752
00:52:35,722 --> 00:52:37,622
- Are you finished?
- I'm not through with it.

753
00:52:37,724 --> 00:52:40,284
- Okay.
- These are the jokes, folks.

754
00:52:40,393 --> 00:52:44,386
I tell ya the truth, it's so--
Hi, how are ya, you bald-headed fag?

755
00:52:48,401 --> 00:52:50,665
- Hey, Joey.
- Tommy, thanks for the drinks.

756
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:52,397
- Come on, any time.
- Charlie, how are ya?

757
00:52:52,505 --> 00:52:54,268
How you doin', Joey?
How's everything?

758
00:52:54,374 --> 00:52:56,774
- Where's Jake?
- He's over there, he don't wanna come.

759
00:52:59,979 --> 00:53:02,539
- If you call him, he'll come.
- All right.

760
00:53:05,051 --> 00:53:07,042
- I'll be right back.
- Here he comes.

761
00:53:07,153 --> 00:53:09,053
What is it?
You don't call anybody anymore.

762
00:53:09,155 --> 00:53:12,454
We never see ya anymore.
For cryin' out loud.

763
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,051
You never come around anymore?
You can't even make a call? What is it?

764
00:53:16,229 --> 00:53:18,595
I'm busy,
I'm goin' away fightin', I'm busy.

765
00:53:18,698 --> 00:53:21,963
Busy, busy.
Look at him takin' me seriously.

766
00:53:22,068 --> 00:53:24,798
I'm only kiddin' you,
what a fuckin' kid.

767
00:53:24,904 --> 00:53:27,134
- That's the best fuckin' fighter around.
- Hey, Jake.

768
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,208
- How you doin'?
- Them mulignanes.

769
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:31,777
forget about it,
they're all afraid to fight you.

770
00:53:31,878 --> 00:53:34,108
- How you feelin', all right?
- I'm all right.

771
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:36,944
- Good? Strong?
- Strong, yeah. I'm doin' okay.

772
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,314
Then Janiro's gotta
watch his ass, right?

773
00:53:40,153 --> 00:53:41,211
I think he should.

774
00:53:41,688 --> 00:53:43,986
Last three, four times,
I won nothin' but money with the guy.

775
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:46,149
He's no piece of cake,
that's a good fighter.

776
00:53:46,259 --> 00:53:48,352
Very attractive guy.
All the girls like him.

777
00:53:48,461 --> 00:53:50,486
No marks, clean.

778
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:55,599
Jake, am I wrong?
Did you gain a few pounds?

779
00:53:55,702 --> 00:53:58,432
A few pounds. I'll knock it off
right away, though, no problem.

780
00:53:58,538 --> 00:54:00,301
Right off, right off.

781
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:05,875
Look, let me ask you somethin'.
I'm just talkin' now, just talkin'.

782
00:54:05,979 --> 00:54:09,779
I come to you, and I'm tellin' you
that I'm gonna bet a lot of money on you

783
00:54:09,883 --> 00:54:12,249
in this fight with Janiro, right?

784
00:54:12,352 --> 00:54:13,478
Yeah?

785
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,456
What would you tell me?
What could you say to me?

786
00:54:17,557 --> 00:54:19,525
I would say
bet everything you got.

787
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:21,856
- Everything?
- Everything.

788
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:24,626
'Cause I'm gonna
open his hole like this.

789
00:54:24,731 --> 00:54:26,358
Excuse my French, girls.

790
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:30,368
- I'm gonna make him suffer.
- What's wrong with this guy?

791
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:33,633
I'm gonna make his mother wish
she never had him.

792
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:36,140
- Is this somethin' personal?
- Make him into dog meat. What?

793
00:54:36,242 --> 00:54:39,177
- Did he say somethin' in the papers?
- No, he's a nice kid.

794
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:40,837
He's a pretty kid, too.

795
00:54:40,947 --> 00:54:44,075
I don't know, I got a problem--
if I should fuck him or fight him.

796
00:54:45,819 --> 00:54:49,220
Must be crazy.
Fuck him or fight him.

797
00:54:49,322 --> 00:54:52,587
You're really liable to get fucked
with this kid, watch out.

798
00:54:52,692 --> 00:54:54,250
- By who?
- Janiro.

799
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,419
You mean you want me
to get him to fuck you?

800
00:54:56,529 --> 00:54:57,553
- Me?
- Yeah.

801
00:54:57,664 --> 00:55:00,292
- No, I don't want him to fuck me.
- I could do that easily.

802
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,367
How you gonna do that?

803
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:03,663
I'll get youse both in the ring
and give youse both a fuckin' beatin',

804
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:05,328
and you both could fuck each other.

805
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:09,531
- I'll get all full of blood.
- You're used to that.

806
00:55:11,511 --> 00:55:13,911
Come on, drink up.
That's ginger ale, Jake.

807
00:55:14,013 --> 00:55:15,674
- Come on, salute.
- Salute.

808
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:18,407
- Jake, good luck.
- Salute. Good luck, Jake.

809
00:55:55,688 --> 00:55:57,280
Hey, Vick.

810
00:56:01,194 --> 00:56:03,526
- What?
- You awake?

811
00:56:04,564 --> 00:56:05,656
No.

812
00:56:08,134 --> 00:56:11,069
- Can you hear me?
- What?

813
00:56:16,643 --> 00:56:18,440
You ever think
of anybody else...

814
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,777
when we're in bed?

815
00:56:22,815 --> 00:56:25,375
- What do you mean?
- You know, when we make love.

816
00:56:26,986 --> 00:56:29,045
No, nobody, I love you.

817
00:56:30,924 --> 00:56:33,222
How come you said
that thing about Janiro?

818
00:56:34,327 --> 00:56:37,626
- What did I say?
- You said he had a pretty face.

819
00:56:38,831 --> 00:56:40,594
I never noticed his face.

820
00:56:41,834 --> 00:56:43,802
How come you said that, then?

821
00:56:45,505 --> 00:56:49,134
I don't even know what I said.
I don't even know what he looks like.

822
00:56:50,009 --> 00:56:51,306
Go to sleep.

823
00:58:07,676 --> 00:58:11,134
- He ain't pretty no more.
- He really messed him up.

824
00:58:14,016 --> 00:58:17,508
And the winner
by unanimous decision

825
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:21,283
in ten rounds,
Jake La Motta!

826
00:58:46,115 --> 00:58:49,414
Give me a little piece of ice,
just a sliver, just for my tongue.

827
00:58:50,019 --> 00:58:52,817
- No water!
- Come on, I'm dyin'.

828
00:58:53,622 --> 00:58:55,419
Fuckin' hard-on.

829
00:58:57,326 --> 00:58:58,725
Four pounds.

830
00:58:59,261 --> 00:59:01,821
Keep workin'.
Cut the bullshit.

831
00:59:09,571 --> 00:59:11,630
I saw him fight with Janiro,
I couldn't believe it--

832
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,833
destroyed this guy,
it was absolutely incredible.

833
00:59:13,942 --> 00:59:16,240
He knocked his nose from
one side of his face to the other.

834
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:18,973
- You've gotta be kiddin'.
- Fuckin' thing was hangin' off.

835
00:59:19,081 --> 00:59:21,242
Who you fightin' next?
Can you tell me?

836
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:23,079
I don't know.
You never know these things--

837
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:25,915
From all I've seen,
they gotta give him that title shot.

838
00:59:26,789 --> 00:59:27,949
Jackie Curtie, Joey.

839
00:59:28,057 --> 00:59:29,388
- You should know each other.
- Hi, Joey.

840
00:59:29,491 --> 00:59:31,391
Pleasure-- heard a lot
of nice things about you.

841
00:59:31,493 --> 00:59:32,824
We're gonna get
the title shot, too.

842
00:59:32,928 --> 00:59:35,795
I'm sure. I like your brother.
Made a lot of money on him.

843
00:59:35,898 --> 00:59:37,593
Probably more than he did,
that's for sure.

844
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,930
Made some nice cabbage
on the Oscar Jackson fight.

845
00:59:40,469 --> 00:59:41,731
Whatever happened to Oscar?

846
00:59:41,837 --> 00:59:44,465
- Anybody see him anymore?
- He's punchy, he probably died.

847
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:46,063
Who the fuck cares?

848
00:59:46,175 --> 00:59:47,472
- Make yourselves comfortable.
- It's a beautiful table.

849
00:59:47,576 --> 00:59:49,271
- The worst table in the house.
- And he's complainin'.

850
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:50,675
It's a beautiful table.

851
00:59:50,779 --> 00:59:52,940
He's workin' downtown,
big building-- workin' an elevator.

852
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,379
Happened to be there the other day.

853
00:59:54,483 --> 00:59:56,917
I'm not Italian, I don't care.

854
00:59:57,019 --> 00:59:58,748
- Took me right up.
- Hey, that Oscar's always

855
00:59:58,854 --> 01:00:00,879
a stand-up guy, Joey,
he did you a lot of good.

856
01:00:00,989 --> 01:00:02,547
Gave your brother
a hell of a fight, too.

857
01:00:02,658 --> 01:00:05,593
Yeah, Mickey?
Cutty Sark and water.

858
01:00:05,694 --> 01:00:06,718
Excuse me one minute, fellas.

859
01:00:06,829 --> 01:00:08,353
- I'll be right back.
- Come back, Joey.

860
01:00:08,464 --> 01:00:10,489
Come on back. Okay.

861
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:13,968
- Hey.
- Hey.

862
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:15,263
Hey, Joe.

863
01:00:15,371 --> 01:00:18,738
- Hey, Joey.
- Look at how he's lookin' at us.

864
01:00:18,841 --> 01:00:21,071
- Something's happening.
- She's having a problem.

865
01:00:21,176 --> 01:00:24,771
- You're worried about it?
- I'm just sittin' there havin' a drink!

866
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,643
- Shut up. Keep your mouth shut.
- Both of youse are the same.

867
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:27,738
I feel like I'm a prisoner.

868
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:30,842
I can't walk, I look at somebody
the wrong way, I get smacked.

869
01:00:31,687 --> 01:00:33,484
You think you're right or somethin',
the way you're fuckin' yellin'?

870
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:34,988
- I am right.
- You're wrong.

871
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,819
I am right.
I'm tired of having to turn around

872
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,018
and havin' both of youse
up my ass all the time.

873
01:00:40,562 --> 01:00:41,893
- Shut up.
- No.

874
01:00:41,997 --> 01:00:43,464
- Don't make me--
- I'm tired of listenin' to you

875
01:00:43,565 --> 01:00:46,625
- and your brother. I'm not wrong.
- Don't make me get nuts in this place.

876
01:00:46,735 --> 01:00:47,861
What am I supposed to do?

877
01:00:48,003 --> 01:00:50,164
I'm 20 years old, I gotta go home
and sleep by myself every night?

878
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:52,035
- What the fuck did you marry him for?
- 'Cause I love him.

879
01:00:52,141 --> 01:00:53,802
- You do?
- Yeah, I love him.

880
01:00:53,909 --> 01:00:56,878
What am I supposed to do?
This guy don't even wanna fuck me.

881
01:00:58,046 --> 01:00:59,604
He's just been
a contender too long.

882
01:00:59,715 --> 01:01:02,843
He'll be all right as soon as he gets
his shot, and then everything'll be okay.

883
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:05,613
You won't have to go fuckin'
runnin' around when he does.

884
01:01:05,721 --> 01:01:08,087
Jake is never gonna be champ.
Too many people hate him.

885
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:10,715
- And you're drinking with them!
- And I'm gonna finish my drink

886
01:01:10,826 --> 01:01:13,624
- and I'm gonna have a good time.
- Get your stuff.

887
01:01:18,567 --> 01:01:19,795
I said you ain't stayin' here.

888
01:01:19,902 --> 01:01:20,891
- Get your stuff.
- I'm stayin'.

889
01:01:21,003 --> 01:01:22,971
You're making an asshole
out of my brother, get your stuff.

890
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,299
- Come on, relax.
- Shut up.

891
01:01:24,406 --> 01:01:26,101
Mind your fuckin' business
and shut up.

892
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:28,802
- You're taking this all wrong.
- I said shut up, didn't I?!

893
01:01:28,911 --> 01:01:30,811
What's the matter with you?
There's nothin' goin' on here.

894
01:01:30,913 --> 01:01:33,040
This is innocent.
We're only having a few drinks.

895
01:01:34,383 --> 01:01:36,578
- Relax, no problem.
- Come on, you know better than that.

896
01:01:36,685 --> 01:01:40,052
- All right. Let's all calm down.
- Just relax, come on.

897
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:41,247
- We've been friends a long time.
- I'm just upset.

898
01:01:41,356 --> 01:01:43,950
- It's my brother's wife...
- There's nothing goin' on over here.

899
01:01:44,059 --> 01:01:45,048
I'm sorry, I really am.

900
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,457
We're friends,
we can straighten this--

901
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:49,225
Right? Nothing going on?!

902
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:52,459
Nothing going on?!
Ya dirty cocksucker!

903
01:01:56,038 --> 01:01:59,201
- Fuckin' hard-on!
- Get off! Get him off!

904
01:01:59,308 --> 01:02:02,471
I'll bite your fuckin' head off,
ya cocksucker!

905
01:02:02,578 --> 01:02:05,479
Get outta here, Joey!
What the fuck are you doin'?!

906
01:02:06,215 --> 01:02:08,183
- Easy, easy! Come on!
- Get your hands off me!

907
01:02:08,283 --> 01:02:10,046
- Come on!
- Come on!

908
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,100
Fuckin' cunt.

909
01:02:14,204 --> 01:02:15,432
Get out! Get outta the way!

910
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,838
Oh, scumbag!
I'm gonna suck your fuckin' eyes out!

911
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:23,871
Hey, you fuckin'--
what are you, nuts?!

912
01:02:23,981 --> 01:02:25,005
Don't mention Tommy.

913
01:02:25,115 --> 01:02:27,174
You do what you do,
and we do what we gotta do.

914
01:02:27,284 --> 01:02:29,115
- Don't mention no names.
- No, you're wrong, Joe.

915
01:02:29,219 --> 01:02:31,244
He's wrong.
No fuckin' trouble in the joint.

916
01:02:37,161 --> 01:02:39,789
I said get outta here,
ya fuckin' mamone!

917
01:02:39,897 --> 01:02:42,593
Get back there,
ya fuck, ya!

918
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:45,296
Take it easy, people.
Come on, now, take it easy.

919
01:02:47,571 --> 01:02:49,801
You've had it,
you rat bastard!

920
01:03:08,258 --> 01:03:10,419
You guys have
a lot of years between you,

921
01:03:10,527 --> 01:03:12,552
and you've done
a lot of things together.

922
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:15,257
I understand, Joey,
it was your brother's wife.

923
01:03:15,365 --> 01:03:16,133
But you don't raise your hands,

924
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:16,963
But you don't raise your hands,

925
01:03:17,134 --> 01:03:20,399
you don't create a scene
like that in a place like that.

926
01:03:20,504 --> 01:03:23,234
Now, we've heard
everybody's point of view here,

927
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:25,501
and we're gonna forget about it.

928
01:03:25,609 --> 01:03:29,067
I shouldn't forget about it,
but we're gonna forget about it.

929
01:03:29,713 --> 01:03:30,839
Right?

930
01:03:30,948 --> 01:03:33,007
What I want you to do now,
you two guys,

931
01:03:33,117 --> 01:03:36,211
I want you to shake hands,
forget this whole thing,

932
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,844
and no grudges.

933
01:03:37,955 --> 01:03:40,753
That's the most important thing--
no grudges.

934
01:03:41,725 --> 01:03:43,522
Now, come on, shake hands.

935
01:03:48,232 --> 01:03:50,700
It's all right with me
if it's all right with you.

936
01:03:50,801 --> 01:03:51,927
All right?

937
01:03:52,836 --> 01:03:54,963
I only wish this thing
never happened.

938
01:03:55,072 --> 01:03:56,903
We all wish it never happened.

939
01:03:57,007 --> 01:04:00,135
Right?
You'll get over it.

940
01:04:00,244 --> 01:04:03,372
Salvy, let me talk
with him alone a minute.

941
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,606
Yeah, all right.

942
01:04:06,783 --> 01:04:09,081
I'll see you Monday,
Tuesday or somethin', all right?

943
01:04:09,186 --> 01:04:11,211
I'm sorry,
I forgot all about it.

944
01:04:11,755 --> 01:04:14,553
What are you, fucking nuts?
You're killin' me.

945
01:04:19,463 --> 01:04:22,330
Aside from everything else,
is the family all right?

946
01:04:22,432 --> 01:04:25,196
Yeah, they're fine.
Everybody's fine.

947
01:04:28,939 --> 01:04:30,998
What is it with you?
You can't talk?

948
01:04:31,108 --> 01:04:32,632
- I'm talkin', what do you mean?
- I know.

949
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:36,008
Why have you got this funny attitude?
I can't figure you out.

950
01:04:36,547 --> 01:04:40,176
What is it with all the quick answers?
"Yeah, they're all right. Yeah."

951
01:04:41,385 --> 01:04:43,444
You wanna get outta here
fast or something?

952
01:04:43,554 --> 01:04:44,919
No, it's nothin' like that.

953
01:04:45,022 --> 01:04:47,923
It's just all the aggravation
and everything and...

954
01:04:48,492 --> 01:04:49,959
all the fights and all.

955
01:04:51,728 --> 01:04:54,162
Listen to me.
Now, Jake...

956
01:04:55,098 --> 01:04:57,692
the guy's become
an embarrassment.

957
01:04:58,402 --> 01:05:01,530
He's embarrassin' me
with certain people,

958
01:05:01,638 --> 01:05:03,902
and I'm lookin' very bad.

959
01:05:04,575 --> 01:05:07,874
I can't deliver a kid from
my own goddamn neighborhood.

960
01:05:08,412 --> 01:05:09,470
What is it with him?

961
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:12,549
Why does he have to make it
so hard on himself?

962
01:05:12,649 --> 01:05:15,277
He comes to me,
I make it easier for him.

963
01:05:18,255 --> 01:05:20,382
The man's got a head of rock.

964
01:05:25,028 --> 01:05:27,826
You know, it's hard
to explain, Tommy, he's...

965
01:05:28,532 --> 01:05:29,829
Jack respects you.

966
01:05:29,933 --> 01:05:32,401
I mean, he don't even
say hello to anybody.

967
01:05:32,502 --> 01:05:34,800
You he talks to, he likes you.

968
01:05:36,306 --> 01:05:38,900
It's just that when he gets
somethin' on his mind,

969
01:05:39,009 --> 01:05:42,001
he's got a hard head,
he likes to do things his own way.

970
01:05:42,112 --> 01:05:44,478
Jesus Christ could
come off the cross sometimes,

971
01:05:44,581 --> 01:05:47,015
he don't give a fuck,
he's gonna do what he wants to do,

972
01:05:47,117 --> 01:05:50,143
he wants to make it on his own.
He thinks he can make it on his own.

973
01:05:50,254 --> 01:05:51,551
Make it on his own.

974
01:05:51,655 --> 01:05:56,718
He thinks he's gonna walk in there
and become champion on his own?

975
01:05:57,461 --> 01:06:00,294
- He's crazy. You know he's nuts.
- Yeah, he's crazy.

976
01:06:00,397 --> 01:06:03,798
And he's got no respect for nobody,
he doesn't listen to nobody.

977
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,197
That's not crazy.

978
01:06:05,302 --> 01:06:08,703
- He respects you, though.
- He doesn't respect anybody.

979
01:06:08,805 --> 01:06:10,932
Now, you do this for me,
you understand?

980
01:06:11,041 --> 01:06:16,240
You tell him I don't care
how colorful he is, how great he is.

981
01:06:16,346 --> 01:06:17,973
He could beat all
the Sugar Ray Robinsons

982
01:06:18,081 --> 01:06:20,106
and the Tony Janiros in the world.

983
01:06:20,217 --> 01:06:23,778
But he ain't gonna get a shot
at that title, not without us, he ain't.

984
01:06:24,621 --> 01:06:26,714
Now, you're a smart kid.

985
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:29,217
You go to him, you tell him...

986
01:06:34,364 --> 01:06:35,661
Son of a bitch.

987
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:38,327
Twenty dollar shoe here.

988
01:06:45,542 --> 01:06:47,510
Aren't you gonna
ask me what happened?

989
01:06:51,715 --> 01:06:52,841
What's the matter?

990
01:06:55,552 --> 01:06:58,180
- What's wrong?
- I remember when I met her here.

991
01:06:59,222 --> 01:07:01,349
- Who?
- Vickie.

992
01:07:04,394 --> 01:07:07,363
Why, what's the matter?
What'd she do now?

993
01:07:10,701 --> 01:07:13,636
I know she's doin' somethin',
I just wanna catch her once.

994
01:07:13,737 --> 01:07:14,863
Just once.

995
01:07:18,475 --> 01:07:21,444
Hey, Jack.
Wanna do yourself a favor?

996
01:07:21,978 --> 01:07:24,208
Bust her fuckin' hole,
throw her out.

997
01:07:24,748 --> 01:07:27,308
Either that, or live with her
and let her ruin your life,

998
01:07:27,417 --> 01:07:29,214
'cause that's what's happenin'.

999
01:07:32,022 --> 01:07:34,991
How much could you take?
How much shit could you take?

1000
01:07:44,868 --> 01:07:46,426
So, what'd that guy say?

1001
01:07:47,371 --> 01:07:49,999
He gave me the old
"good news, bad news" routine.

1002
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:51,598
The good news is

1003
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:53,835
you're gonna get
the shot at the title.

1004
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:58,176
The bad news is they want you
to do the old flip-flop for them.

1005
01:07:59,282 --> 01:08:01,273
- So, what else is new?
- What'd you expect?

1006
01:08:01,385 --> 01:08:02,818
You didn't know that was comin'?

1007
01:08:03,887 --> 01:08:05,548
You win some,
you lose some.

1008
01:08:05,655 --> 01:08:07,122
This one, we're losin'.

1009
01:08:09,459 --> 01:08:10,585
Billy Fox.

1010
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:14,928
173 and 3/4 pounds.

1011
01:08:17,501 --> 01:08:21,801
- Jake La Motta. 167...
- I guess you've heard by now

1012
01:08:21,905 --> 01:08:25,170
a lot of the stuff that's
goin' around, a lot of rumors.

1013
01:08:25,709 --> 01:08:29,008
Matter of fact, a short time ago
you were a big favorite,

1014
01:08:29,112 --> 01:08:31,478
and all of a sudden,
you're a 12-5 underdog,

1015
01:08:31,581 --> 01:08:33,572
and people are talkin',
it's as simple as that.

1016
01:08:33,683 --> 01:08:36,481
- That's funny, I never heard anything.
- It's out there, though,

1017
01:08:36,586 --> 01:08:37,644
and It's not good.

1018
01:08:37,754 --> 01:08:39,722
As a matter of fact,
the bets are off on this one.

1019
01:08:39,823 --> 01:08:41,654
Nothin' goin' in this one.

1020
01:08:41,758 --> 01:08:45,592
Matter of fact, smart money is sayin'
that you're getting ready to hit the tank.

1021
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:47,890
- That's bullshit.
- Yeah, that's bullshit.

1022
01:08:48,865 --> 01:08:50,162
You got any money
you wanna bet?

1023
01:08:50,267 --> 01:08:51,825
- Come on.
- I'll take the action, go ahead.

1024
01:08:51,935 --> 01:08:54,733
You bet it on Fox,
'cause I'm gonna win.

1025
01:08:54,838 --> 01:08:57,170
There's no way I'm goin' down.
I don't go down for nobody.

1026
01:08:57,274 --> 01:08:59,071
- That's what I wanted to hear.
- I want you to know that.

1027
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:00,643
- All right.
- All right, Colonel.

1028
01:09:00,744 --> 01:09:02,234
Okay, that's it.

1029
01:09:02,345 --> 01:09:03,676
You came down here just
for that nonsense?

1030
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:05,475
- That was it?
- That was it.

1031
01:09:15,926 --> 01:09:17,518
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1032
01:09:17,627 --> 01:09:20,528
Welcome to
the Madison Square Garden

1033
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:22,723
feature attraction.

1034
01:09:22,833 --> 01:09:27,395
- In this corner, weighing 175 pounds...
- Commissioner, how about a picture?

1035
01:09:27,504 --> 01:09:29,301
Fellas, can we get
a picture over here?

1036
01:09:29,406 --> 01:09:33,206
...the undefeated Billy Fox.

1037
01:09:37,013 --> 01:09:39,072
Hi, Steve. Your brother
got out of the hospital?

1038
01:09:39,182 --> 01:09:42,174
- They think it's all right.
- Did he get out? Good.

1039
01:09:43,987 --> 01:09:46,455
- Charlie, let me sit over there.
- Yeah, sure.

1040
01:09:47,858 --> 01:09:50,554
Tommy, what's the matter?
Everything's all right?

1041
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:52,093
It's all right, yeah.

1042
01:09:52,195 --> 01:09:53,856
Touch gloves now,
come out boxing.

1043
01:09:53,964 --> 01:09:55,761
Five seconds, Alex.

1044
01:10:08,378 --> 01:10:11,074
Come on, stand--
come on, stand up!

1045
01:10:11,181 --> 01:10:13,877
What the fuck you doin'?
Hit me, ya fuckin' bum, come on.

1046
01:10:14,551 --> 01:10:15,677
Come on.

1047
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:19,720
What are you doin', Jake?!
Come on, box him!

1048
01:10:29,566 --> 01:10:31,363
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

1049
01:10:31,902 --> 01:10:33,961
What do you think
you're doin' out there?!

1050
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:35,367
- Huh?
- Little slow, that's all.

1051
01:10:35,472 --> 01:10:38,032
- What are you doin' out there?
- Take it easy, he'll be all right.

1052
01:10:38,141 --> 01:10:41,304
He's a little slow. He'll make it up,
what are ya worried about?

1053
01:10:41,411 --> 01:10:44,972
Goddamn it. Come on,
pick it up a little, Jake, I'm sorry.

1054
01:10:45,081 --> 01:10:47,311
Come on, Jake,
I got some money on ya!

1055
01:10:47,918 --> 01:10:50,079
- Tank job!
- Hit him back, ya bum!

1056
01:10:50,186 --> 01:10:51,483
- Come on.
- Hit him back!

1057
01:10:52,422 --> 01:10:55,357
You fuckin' bum!
You're takin' a dive in the fourth?

1058
01:10:55,892 --> 01:10:57,985
Pocket your dirty money!

1059
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:03,158
Aw, you phony bastard!
That's a fix!

1060
01:11:03,266 --> 01:11:04,824
We're stoppin' the fight!

1061
01:11:05,402 --> 01:11:08,701
What the fuck are you waitin' for
to stop the fight, ya jerk?!

1062
01:11:09,272 --> 01:11:10,330
And you standin' there.

1063
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:13,432
- Fuckin' go down, will ya?
- The referee stops this bout

1064
01:11:13,543 --> 01:11:18,242
at 2:23 of the fourth round.

1065
01:11:18,348 --> 01:11:21,749
The winner
by technical knockout,

1066
01:11:21,851 --> 01:11:24,012
and still undefeated,

1067
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:27,112
Billy Fox!

1068
01:11:28,892 --> 01:11:30,359
What'd I do?!

1069
01:11:42,572 --> 01:11:43,630
Don't fight anymore.

1070
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:46,538
It's a free country,
don't fight anymore.

1071
01:11:47,911 --> 01:11:51,711
Aw, what'd I do?
What'd I do?

1072
01:11:56,086 --> 01:11:58,247
What'd I do?

1073
01:12:05,261 --> 01:12:07,229
- Get outta here!
- Jake has an interview--

1074
01:12:09,265 --> 01:12:12,234
It's all right, Jake.
It's all right.

1075
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:16,738
Why did I do it? Why?

1076
01:12:22,345 --> 01:12:24,643
They got some balls,
some balls.

1077
01:12:25,882 --> 01:12:28,009
I take the dive.
What more do they want?

1078
01:12:28,551 --> 01:12:30,109
They want me
to go down, too?

1079
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,688
I ain't goin' down.
I ain't goin' down for nobody.

1080
01:12:32,789 --> 01:12:35,417
Why don't you do me a favor?
Just put your hands up.

1081
01:12:35,525 --> 01:12:37,823
I wanna show you somethin'.
Put your hands up.

1082
01:12:39,062 --> 01:12:42,862
- What the fuck is so hard about that?
- Hey, you don't understand.

1083
01:12:43,967 --> 01:12:46,527
I had to fight a bum.
He's a bum.

1084
01:12:46,636 --> 01:12:49,537
I fought the guy, I tapped him like that,
all of a sudden he's like this

1085
01:12:49,639 --> 01:12:51,266
all over the place,
what am I gonna do?

1086
01:12:51,374 --> 01:12:53,467
You don't have to fuckin'
pick him up and help him.

1087
01:12:53,576 --> 01:12:55,271
What am I gonna do?
If I don't pick him up,

1088
01:12:55,378 --> 01:12:57,608
then what am I gonna do?
I'm gonna be in worse trouble.

1089
01:12:58,415 --> 01:12:59,939
I don't know.

1090
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:03,076
"Purse was withheld--" look at this--
"Purse was withheld pending

1091
01:13:03,186 --> 01:13:05,245
D.A.'s probe."
Look at that.

1092
01:13:05,355 --> 01:13:07,949
Look how they make me look.

1093
01:13:08,058 --> 01:13:10,083
Like a bum,
like a mammalucco.

1094
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,727
A what?

1095
01:13:11,828 --> 01:13:14,092
Like the mammalucco of the year.

1096
01:13:14,197 --> 01:13:15,824
Tommy ain't gonna forget us.

1097
01:13:16,666 --> 01:13:19,226
You're gonna get your shot,
as long as he don't die.

1098
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:22,428
- As long as who don't die?
- Tommy.

1099
01:13:22,539 --> 01:13:24,097
What are you talkin' about?

1100
01:13:24,207 --> 01:13:26,107
In other words,
Tommy ain't gonna forget ya,

1101
01:13:26,209 --> 01:13:27,437
you're gonna get your shot
if he don't die.

1102
01:13:27,544 --> 01:13:29,603
- Gotta make sure the guy stays alive.
- He got a disease or somethin'?

1103
01:13:29,713 --> 01:13:31,613
No, I'm just sayin',
I'm kiddin', like.

1104
01:13:31,715 --> 01:13:33,478
What's wrong with him?
Is somethin' wrong with him?

1105
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:35,517
There ain't nothin' wrong with him,
that's the only way you wouldn't get it

1106
01:13:35,618 --> 01:13:38,519
- is if he dies, he won't be able to--
- What are you talkin' like that for?

1107
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:48,787
What do you want me to do?
It's an outdoor arena.

1108
01:13:48,898 --> 01:13:51,696
What do you wanna do,
fight in the rain? It's a stadium.

1109
01:13:51,801 --> 01:13:53,393
You waited this long,
you can wait longer.

1110
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:56,538
You wanna wait 24 hours?
I don't wanna wait no 24 hours.

1111
01:13:56,639 --> 01:13:59,699
I don't either, but we gotta,
so we'll wait. Hello?

1112
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:03,470
- You guys wanna stop now?
- Get off the phone with them.

1113
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:05,138
Why do you give them
the satisfaction?

1114
01:14:05,248 --> 01:14:07,546
- Get off the phone with them!
- He don't wanna talk to nobody.

1115
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:09,811
How many times do we have
to tell ya? You hear him yellin'?

1116
01:14:09,919 --> 01:14:12,479
There's enough confusion up here.
Please, don't call.

1117
01:14:12,589 --> 01:14:15,888
No comment. Right.
Thank you. Bye!

1118
01:14:15,992 --> 01:14:17,983
Pains in the asses,
I don't believe them.

1119
01:14:18,094 --> 01:14:20,722
Why do you give them the satisfaction?
Why don't you just hang up on 'em?

1120
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:22,730
- That's all.
- I'm gonna get somethin' to eat.

1121
01:14:22,832 --> 01:14:24,959
- What do you want to eat?
- I don't want nothin'.

1122
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:26,628
I don't want nothin'.

1123
01:14:26,736 --> 01:14:28,704
Eat somethin',
you gotta eat somethin'.

1124
01:14:30,874 --> 01:14:33,342
You can't go without eatin'.
Eat a steak.

1125
01:14:33,443 --> 01:14:36,344
You chew it, you spit it out,
you'll still make the weight tomorrow.

1126
01:14:37,046 --> 01:14:38,479
You're worried about that?

1127
01:14:40,717 --> 01:14:43,015
I'll order a steak.
At least if you want it, it's here.

1128
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:45,019
You don't want it,
do whatever you want with it.

1129
01:14:45,121 --> 01:14:47,555
- Go ahead.
- Vickie, what do you want?

1130
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:50,122
Order me a piece of cake.

1131
01:14:50,226 --> 01:14:52,126
That's all you want
is a piece of cake?

1132
01:14:52,228 --> 01:14:55,857
Why don't you get a cheeseburger,
French fries? It's better for you.

1133
01:14:55,965 --> 01:14:57,956
- It's like a whole meal.
- Yeah, that's good.

1134
01:14:58,067 --> 01:14:59,534
That's good,
order me one of those.

1135
01:14:59,636 --> 01:15:01,570
Wait a minute,
what do you want to eat?

1136
01:15:01,671 --> 01:15:03,901
Since when did you
order one of those?

1137
01:15:04,674 --> 01:15:06,403
- That's what I want.
- It's a free country.

1138
01:15:06,509 --> 01:15:08,636
You order what you want.
Don't let nobody influence you.

1139
01:15:08,745 --> 01:15:10,872
I'm not tellin' her what to eat,
I was just suggesting.

1140
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:12,914
What are you tellin' her
what to ask for?

1141
01:15:13,016 --> 01:15:16,144
I'm not tellin' her-- personally,
I don't give a fuck what she eats.

1142
01:15:16,252 --> 01:15:18,880
What were you tellin' her that for?

1143
01:15:18,988 --> 01:15:20,888
Order me a cheeseburger.

1144
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:26,454
Just order her
a cheeseburger, that's all.

1145
01:15:27,664 --> 01:15:28,892
What the f--?

1146
01:15:28,998 --> 01:15:32,092
What are you guys doin' so long?
How long does this thing take to do?

1147
01:15:32,202 --> 01:15:33,169
Forty seconds.

1148
01:15:33,269 --> 01:15:35,829
Forty seconds is no good.
You gotta do it in 30 seconds.

1149
01:15:35,939 --> 01:15:38,066
If we gotta stitch him up,
that's how much time.

1150
01:15:42,545 --> 01:15:43,671
Ya up?

1151
01:15:44,214 --> 01:15:46,682
- What?
- Somebody's here to see ya.

1152
01:15:47,817 --> 01:15:49,182
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Tommy, how you doin'?

1153
01:15:49,285 --> 01:15:50,582
How are you?

1154
01:15:56,226 --> 01:15:58,023
Say hello to Charlie. Charlie!

1155
01:15:58,127 --> 01:16:00,755
- Jake, how are ya? Lots of luck.
- Hello, Charlie, good to see you.

1156
01:16:01,297 --> 01:16:02,594
Thank you.

1157
01:16:03,733 --> 01:16:06,668
- How you feeling?
- I'm feelin' all right, thank you.

1158
01:16:06,769 --> 01:16:09,863
- Are you feeling good?
- I feel as good as I'm gonna feel.

1159
01:16:09,973 --> 01:16:12,441
I gotta get in there and fight,
then I'll know how I'm gonna feel.

1160
01:16:12,542 --> 01:16:15,636
All right. We just come by
to wish you luck and all that.

1161
01:16:15,745 --> 01:16:17,212
- Thanks.
- You need anything?

1162
01:16:17,313 --> 01:16:18,678
- No.
- You sure, nothing?

1163
01:16:18,781 --> 01:16:19,748
No, thank you, Tommy.

1164
01:16:19,849 --> 01:16:21,908
All right.
Take care, good luck.

1165
01:16:22,018 --> 01:16:23,713
- God bless ya.
- All right, thank you.

1166
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:26,118
- You'll be all right.
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

1167
01:16:26,923 --> 01:16:28,185
See you later, everybody.

1168
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:30,156
- Vickie, good-bye.
- Tommy, wait.

1169
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:32,728
We really appreciate your comin',
I want you to know that.

1170
01:16:32,829 --> 01:16:34,990
It was really nice of you.
I appreciate it.

1171
01:16:35,098 --> 01:16:37,965
- Come on, Joey, anytime.
- A time like this is very important to him.

1172
01:16:38,067 --> 01:16:40,365
- Anytime.
- I just wanted to say good-bye.

1173
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:43,303
So long, honey. I want you
to take good care of that guy, all right?

1174
01:16:43,406 --> 01:16:45,670
- I'll take care of him.
- Joey, any little thing,

1175
01:16:45,775 --> 01:16:48,505
I want you to call me.
He's very nervous. Ba-boom, call.

1176
01:16:48,611 --> 01:16:49,600
Good-bye, honey.

1177
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,246
Would you look at that face?
What a face.

1178
01:16:53,349 --> 01:16:55,010
Can you believe that girl?

1179
01:16:55,118 --> 01:16:57,450
Look at that beauty.
Just as beautiful as ever.

1180
01:16:57,553 --> 01:16:59,748
- The least little thing, all right?
- Bye-bye, Tommy.

1181
01:16:59,856 --> 01:17:03,314
- So long, everybody.
- So long, Tommy.

1182
01:17:12,902 --> 01:17:14,699
Hey! Come here.

1183
01:17:15,471 --> 01:17:16,768
Come here a minute.

1184
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:25,807
What was all that about?

1185
01:17:26,516 --> 01:17:27,540
All what?

1186
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:29,413
You know what I'm talkin' about.
What was that all about?

1187
01:17:31,187 --> 01:17:34,156
- With him.
- Nothin', I just said good-bye.

1188
01:17:34,257 --> 01:17:36,350
All of a sudden you're
so friendly with him?

1189
01:17:36,459 --> 01:17:38,154
- I just said good-bye.
- You don't do that.

1190
01:17:38,261 --> 01:17:40,627
You say hello, you say good-bye,
that's all, ya hear?

1191
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,197
- I hear.
- Hey!

1192
01:17:42,799 --> 01:17:45,427
You hear what I said? You don't ever
have any disrespect for me.

1193
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:47,162
You hear what I said?

1194
01:17:48,738 --> 01:17:51,536
- Yeah, I hear.
- All right. Go in there.

1195
01:17:52,442 --> 01:17:54,410
- Come here.
- Why don't you stop that?

1196
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:56,137
Shut up, you! Shut up!

1197
01:17:56,245 --> 01:17:58,679
Shut up! I'll fuckin'
take care of you later!

1198
01:17:58,781 --> 01:17:59,907
Shut up!

1199
01:18:08,324 --> 01:18:10,792
Disgusted with the two of youse.

1200
01:18:15,331 --> 01:18:16,730
Get to youse later.

1201
01:18:21,871 --> 01:18:24,339
I'm the boss, I'm the boss...

1202
01:18:26,876 --> 01:18:28,673
Hit the fuckin' thing, come on!

1203
01:18:30,713 --> 01:18:32,010
All right, let's go.

1204
01:19:02,912 --> 01:19:04,539
Good luck, Jake!

1205
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:48,953

of the World, 15 rounds.

1206
01:19:49,058 --> 01:19:52,619

1207
01:19:52,728 --> 01:19:56,164
weighing in at 158 1/4 pounds,

01:19:56,265 --> 01:20:00,565

01:20:38,141 --> 01:20:39,699

Now finish him off.
He's all stupiada. you got him.

01:20:58,227 --> 01:21:00,661
Blow on him, he'll fuckin' fall

1215
01:21:00,763 --> 01:21:03,425
Look at him.
Do you feel all right?

1216
01:21:06,235 --> 01:21:08,066
- No way, huh?
- Can't continue?

1217
01:21:08,738 --> 01:21:11,536
Hey, Commissioner? Come on in,
I'm gonna stop the fight.

1218
01:21:11,641 --> 01:21:13,108
Yeah, you did it, Jake!

1219
01:21:25,188 --> 01:21:28,316
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

1220
01:21:28,524 --> 01:21:32,927
Cerdan, unable to continue,
the referee stops the fight.

1221
01:21:33,029 --> 01:21:35,259
And the winner by
a technical knockout

01:21:35,364 --> 01:21:36,763

01:21:47,109 --> 01:21:50,078
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

1226
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:10,693
Don't shake that.
Don't shake it like that, I'm tellin' ya.

1227
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,495
It's the worst thing you could do.

1228
01:22:17,907 --> 01:22:19,204
Oh, you're home.

1229
01:22:20,243 --> 01:22:22,643
- Hi, Vick.
- Hi, Joe.

1230
01:22:25,414 --> 01:22:27,814
- Hello.
- Hi. Where were ya?

1231
01:22:27,917 --> 01:22:30,818
I went out.
What's the matter?

1232
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,387
Television won't work.

1233
01:22:33,256 --> 01:22:34,746
Where'd you go?

1234
01:22:34,857 --> 01:22:39,157
Went out, went shoppin'.
Went to my sister's. You know.

1235
01:22:50,539 --> 01:22:54,066
What's the matter with you?
What's with this kissin' on the mouth?

1236
01:22:54,176 --> 01:22:56,235
I just said hello.
Can't I kiss my sister-in-law?

1237
01:22:56,345 --> 01:22:57,869
Isn't the cheek
good enough for you?

1238
01:22:57,980 --> 01:22:58,947
Come on, huh?

1239
01:22:59,048 --> 01:23:00,606
I don't even kiss Mom on the mouth
the way you kiss her.

1240
01:23:00,716 --> 01:23:02,308
All of a sudden,
you're like a Romeo.

1241
01:23:02,418 --> 01:23:04,352
You're not supposed to kiss
your mother on the mouth.

1242
01:23:04,453 --> 01:23:06,080
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1243
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,326
- How's that?
- That looks like somethin'.

1244
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:20,460
Get back, I can't see nothin'
with your stomach in the way.

1245
01:23:21,671 --> 01:23:23,662
What are you
givin' me dirty looks for?

1246
01:23:26,509 --> 01:23:29,307
Supposed to be a champion,
ya eat like there's no tomorrow.

1247
01:23:29,412 --> 01:23:31,209
That's it, go ahead--
forget how long it took you

1248
01:23:31,314 --> 01:23:33,407
to get to the title,
all the years, the hard work.

1249
01:23:33,516 --> 01:23:36,246
You forgot. You're gonna
defend it next month, keep eatin'.

1250
01:23:37,019 --> 01:23:39,647
Give me dirty looks like
I don't know what I'm talkin' about?

1251
01:23:43,192 --> 01:23:45,820
What happened with you
and Salvy at the Copa that time?

1252
01:23:45,928 --> 01:23:48,920
- When?
- When you gave him a beatin'.

1253
01:23:49,699 --> 01:23:51,860
You mean when I caught
his head in the taxicab door,

1254
01:23:51,967 --> 01:23:54,197
and was bangin' it,
smacked him with a glass?

1255
01:23:54,303 --> 01:23:56,237
- Yeah.
- I told you about that.

1256
01:23:56,872 --> 01:23:58,339
- Didn't I?
- No.

1257
01:23:58,441 --> 01:24:00,841
- I never told you?
- No, you never told me.

1258
01:24:00,943 --> 01:24:02,274
It was no big thing, anyway.

1259
01:24:02,378 --> 01:24:05,176
I smacked him in the mouth,
he was drunk, he started some shit.

1260
01:24:05,281 --> 01:24:07,476
Had to go downtown,
straighten it all out with Tommy.

1261
01:24:07,583 --> 01:24:09,574
It's all forgotten about,
supposedly, anyway.

1262
01:24:09,685 --> 01:24:11,778
How come you
never told me about it?

1263
01:24:11,887 --> 01:24:14,117
It didn't have anything
to do with you.

1264
01:24:15,725 --> 01:24:17,590
- Had nothin' to do with me?
- No.

1265
01:24:17,693 --> 01:24:21,424
Who'd it have somethin'
to do with-- Vickie?

1266
01:24:22,064 --> 01:24:24,965
I just explained
the whole thing to you, didn't I?

1267
01:24:25,067 --> 01:24:27,058
- Yeah.
- It was between me and Salvy.

1268
01:24:27,169 --> 01:24:30,570
If it had anything to do with you
and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.

1269
01:24:33,843 --> 01:24:35,470
That's not what I heard, Joe.

1270
01:24:35,578 --> 01:24:37,068
What do you mean,
that's not what you heard?

1271
01:24:37,179 --> 01:24:39,147
- That's not what I heard.
- What'd you hear?

1272
01:24:39,248 --> 01:24:40,806
I heard some things.

1273
01:24:41,517 --> 01:24:44,111
- You heard about me and Salvy--
- I heard things, Joey.

1274
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:46,745
You heard that I cracked Salvy
all around, what'd you hear?

1275
01:24:46,856 --> 01:24:48,756
- I heard things.
- What things you heard?

1276
01:24:48,858 --> 01:24:49,950
I heard some things.

1277
01:24:50,059 --> 01:24:52,550
You heard things. You wanna worry?
Don't start that shit.

1278
01:24:52,661 --> 01:24:54,094
You know what
you should worry about?

1279
01:24:54,196 --> 01:24:57,256
Worry you got this title fight next month.
That's what you should worry about.

1280
01:24:58,167 --> 01:24:59,293
Do that.

1281
01:25:03,072 --> 01:25:04,198
Christ!

1282
01:25:09,078 --> 01:25:11,478
- Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
- What?

1283
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:13,172
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?

1284
01:25:15,117 --> 01:25:17,551
Hey, Jack,
don't start your shit.

1285
01:25:17,653 --> 01:25:19,621
- No, really, don't start.
- Joey, I asked ya.

1286
01:25:19,722 --> 01:25:22,782
- Didn't I ask ya to keep an eye on her?
- And I did keep an eye on her.

1287
01:25:22,892 --> 01:25:24,325
Then how come ya
gave him a beatin'?

1288
01:25:24,427 --> 01:25:26,725
I told you that.
I told you what that was all about.

1289
01:25:26,829 --> 01:25:28,456
Didn't have nothin' to do with you.

1290
01:25:28,564 --> 01:25:31,499
- He thinks he's a wiseguy--
- Joey, don't lie to me.

1291
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,625
- I'm not lyin'.
- What do I look like to you?

1292
01:25:33,736 --> 01:25:35,294
Hey, I'm your brother.

1293
01:25:35,404 --> 01:25:37,463
You're supposed to believe me.
Don't you trust me?

1294
01:25:37,573 --> 01:25:39,063
- No, I don't.
- You don't? That's nice.

1295
01:25:39,175 --> 01:25:42,110
I don't trust you when it comes to her.
I don't trust nobody.

1296
01:25:43,112 --> 01:25:47,310
- Tell me what happened.
- I told you exactly what happened.

1297
01:25:47,416 --> 01:25:49,850
He got out of line,
I slapped him around.

1298
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:52,716
Tommy straightened it all out,
and it's all over.

1299
01:25:58,694 --> 01:26:00,525
You give me
that look, Joey.

1300
01:26:03,399 --> 01:26:06,197
I gotta accept
your answer, you know?

1301
01:26:06,302 --> 01:26:08,270
But I'm tellin' ya now,
if I hear anything,

1302
01:26:08,370 --> 01:26:11,032
I swear on our mother,
I'm gonna kill somebody.

1303
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:15,408
- I'm gonna kill somebody.
- Well, go ahead and kill everybody!

1304
01:26:15,511 --> 01:26:16,944
You're the tough guy,
go kill people.

1305
01:26:17,046 --> 01:26:19,344
Kill Vickie, kill Salvy,
kill Tommy Como,

1306
01:26:19,448 --> 01:26:21,313
kill me, while you're at it,
what do I care?

1307
01:26:21,417 --> 01:26:24,250
You're killin' yourself,
the way you eat, ya fat fuck!

1308
01:26:24,353 --> 01:26:26,253
- Look at ya!
- What do you mean?

1309
01:26:26,355 --> 01:26:28,255
I don't understand,
what do you mean, kill you?

1310
01:26:28,357 --> 01:26:32,453
Me, kill me! Start here!
Kill me first, do me a fuckin' favor!

1311
01:26:32,561 --> 01:26:34,586
'Cause you're drivin' me crazy!

1312
01:26:34,697 --> 01:26:37,632
You're a killer, you're a big shot.
Just kill, you're a killer.

1313
01:26:37,733 --> 01:26:39,963
Excuse me,
what do you mean by you, though?

1314
01:26:40,069 --> 01:26:42,902
So? What does that mean?
Don't mean nothin'.

1315
01:26:43,005 --> 01:26:45,439
Even you don't know
what you meant by you.

1316
01:26:45,541 --> 01:26:48,066
- Don't mean nothin'.
- Joey, that meant somethin'.

1317
01:26:48,177 --> 01:26:50,577
You mentioned Tommy, Salvy,
you mentioned you--

1318
01:26:50,679 --> 01:26:52,112
you included you with them.

1319
01:26:52,648 --> 01:26:55,640
You coulda said anybody,
but you said you and them.

1320
01:26:56,685 --> 01:26:59,153
You really let this girl
ruin your life, look at ya.

1321
01:26:59,255 --> 01:27:02,156
She really did some job on ya,
ya know how fuckin' nuts you are?

1322
01:27:02,258 --> 01:27:04,783
- Look what she did to you!
- You fuck my wife?

1323
01:27:04,927 --> 01:27:06,861
- What?!
- You fuck my wife?

1324
01:27:10,533 --> 01:27:12,296
How could you ask me
a question like that?

1325
01:27:12,401 --> 01:27:14,301
How could you ask me?
I'm your brother.

1326
01:27:14,403 --> 01:27:16,371
You ask me that?

1327
01:27:17,239 --> 01:27:20,037
Where do you get your balls
big enough to ask me that?

1328
01:27:23,812 --> 01:27:25,109
Just tell me.

1329
01:27:30,052 --> 01:27:31,815
I'm not answerin' that.

1330
01:27:31,921 --> 01:27:34,082
I'm not gonna answer that,
it's stupid.

1331
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,889
You're very smart, Joey.

1332
01:27:42,164 --> 01:27:45,463
You're givin' me all these answers,
but you ain't givin' me the right answer.

1333
01:27:48,404 --> 01:27:49,928
I'm gonna ask ya again.

1334
01:27:52,675 --> 01:27:54,438
Did you or did you not?

1335
01:27:55,611 --> 01:27:57,044
I'm not gonna answer.

1336
01:27:57,146 --> 01:27:59,080
That's a sick question,
you're a sick fuck,

1337
01:27:59,181 --> 01:28:01,240
and I'm not that sick
that I'm gonna answer it.

1338
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:03,648
I'm not tellin' ya anything.
I'm gonna leave.

1339
01:28:03,752 --> 01:28:06,721
If Lenore calls, tell her I went home.
I'm not stayin' in this nuthouse with ya.

1340
01:28:06,822 --> 01:28:08,949
You're a sick bastard--
I feel sorry for ya, I really do.

1341
01:28:09,058 --> 01:28:10,116
You know what you should do?

1342
01:28:10,225 --> 01:28:12,819
Try a little more fuckin'
and a little less eatin'.

1343
01:28:12,928 --> 01:28:15,089
You won't have troubles
upstairs in your bedroom,

1344
01:28:15,197 --> 01:28:17,324
and you won't pick it out
on me and everybody else.

1345
01:28:17,433 --> 01:28:20,527
Ya understand, ya fuckin' wacko?
You're crackin' up.

1346
01:28:22,371 --> 01:28:24,339
Fuckin' screwball, ya.

1347
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:09,477
Where were ya?

1348
01:29:09,585 --> 01:29:10,950
I was at my sister's.

1349
01:29:11,053 --> 01:29:12,714
Where'd you go after that?

1350
01:29:14,089 --> 01:29:16,785
- To the movies.
- Yeah, what'd you see?

1351
01:29:18,861 --> 01:29:20,453
Father of the Bride.

1352
01:29:26,368 --> 01:29:28,836
How come you didn't
tell me about the Copa?

1353
01:29:31,373 --> 01:29:33,841
- Tell you what about it?
- You know.

1354
01:29:34,543 --> 01:29:36,568
How come you didn't
tell me about it?

1355
01:29:37,813 --> 01:29:39,940
Why didn't you tell
me about it, huh?

1356
01:29:40,049 --> 01:29:42,017
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

1357
01:29:43,485 --> 01:29:46,386
Why didn't you tell me?
Did you fuck my brother?

1358
01:29:46,488 --> 01:29:48,922
- Get off me, you fat pig!
- Did you? Did you?

1359
01:29:49,024 --> 01:29:50,321
- Huh?
- No!

1360
01:29:57,232 --> 01:29:58,256
Open the door.

1361
01:29:58,367 --> 01:29:59,994
- Get away!
- Come on, open the door.

1362
01:30:00,102 --> 01:30:02,502
- I wanna talk to you.
- Get away from me, you're sick!

1363
01:30:02,604 --> 01:30:05,164
I just wanna ask you one thing.
Why'd you fuck Joey?

1364
01:30:05,274 --> 01:30:06,571
- Get away!
- Open the door.

1365
01:30:06,675 --> 01:30:07,801
No.

1366
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:13,375
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it, huh?

1367
01:30:13,816 --> 01:30:15,147
I didn't do anything!

1368
01:30:17,352 --> 01:30:20,321
- Why did you fuck them?
- Do what? I didn't do anything?!

1369
01:30:20,422 --> 01:30:21,411
I fucked all of 'em!

1370
01:30:21,523 --> 01:30:23,650
- What do you want me to say?
- What do you mean, who'd you fuck?

1371
01:30:23,759 --> 01:30:26,319
I fucked all of 'em-- Tommy,
Salvy, your brother, all of 'em!

1372
01:30:26,428 --> 01:30:29,090
I sucked your brother's cock!
What do you want me to say?!

1373
01:30:30,199 --> 01:30:31,996
- You sucked his cock?
- I sucked his cock,

1374
01:30:32,101 --> 01:30:33,932
and everybody else on
the fuckin' street.

1375
01:30:34,036 --> 01:30:37,096
What do you want? You're nothin'
but a fat pig, selfish fool!

1376
01:30:38,707 --> 01:30:40,174
Forget fuckin' with you!

1377
01:30:44,713 --> 01:30:47,978
His fuckin' cock's
bigger than yours, too!

1378
01:30:49,384 --> 01:30:51,045
Where you goin'?

1379
01:30:51,153 --> 01:30:53,713
Where are you goin',
you bastard?

1380
01:30:53,822 --> 01:30:55,687
You sick animal!
Where you goin'?

1381
01:30:55,791 --> 01:30:59,693
Let me go! Get off of me,
ya piece of shit!

1382
01:30:59,795 --> 01:31:02,286
If I see you put your hands
in that plate one more time,

1383
01:31:02,397 --> 01:31:04,297
I'm gonna stab you
with this knife, ya hear me?

1384
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:07,027
I told ya, keep your hands
outta the plate!

1385
01:31:08,337 --> 01:31:11,170
Why can't we eat in peace
around here? Just relax.

1386
01:31:11,273 --> 01:31:13,207
Do I have to eat like you?
Like a gavone, like--

1387
01:31:13,308 --> 01:31:16,539
Jack! Jack!
What's the matter with you?!

1388
01:31:16,645 --> 01:31:18,078
Ya fucked my wife, huh?!

1389
01:31:22,017 --> 01:31:23,211
Get off of him!

1390
01:31:25,921 --> 01:31:29,584
- I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya!
- Stop it, he didn't do it!

1391
01:31:32,027 --> 01:31:33,756
Call the police!

1392
01:31:36,331 --> 01:31:37,798
I'll fuckin' kill ya!

1393
01:31:40,002 --> 01:31:41,128
Get out!

1394
01:32:35,190 --> 01:32:37,181
Don't leave, honey, please.

1395
01:33:09,558 --> 01:33:13,426
Honey, look-- I'm a bum without
you and the kids, don't go.

1396
01:33:31,546 --> 01:33:32,638
Just...

1397
01:33:53,802 --> 01:33:56,362
Less than a minute to go,
and La Motta is losing the title

1398
01:33:56,471 --> 01:33:58,701
that he won from
the gallant Marcel Cerdan.

1399
01:33:58,807 --> 01:34:01,708
After the tragic plane crash
that took Cerdan's life.

1400
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:04,711
Laurent Dauthuille vowed
to bring the title back to France.

1401
01:34:04,813 --> 01:34:07,714
Tonight, he only has to last
this fifteenth round

1402
01:34:07,816 --> 01:34:10,444
to be crowned the new
Middleweight Champion.

1403
01:34:11,153 --> 01:34:14,589
La Motta is taking terrible punishment
on the ropes as Dauthuille bangs him

1404
01:34:14,690 --> 01:34:18,091
with lefts and rights to the head.
Another left, another right to the jaw.

1405
01:34:18,193 --> 01:34:20,684
La Motta turns around,
he's been playing possum!

1406
01:34:20,796 --> 01:34:23,458
He's got Dauthuille hurt!
He rips a right hand to the body,

1407
01:34:23,565 --> 01:34:26,329
two left hooks to the jaw,
another left and a right to the head!

1408
01:34:26,435 --> 01:34:28,733
Dauthuille is reeling around the ring!

1409
01:34:28,837 --> 01:34:31,101
The tide has turned,
no question about it!

1410
01:34:34,776 --> 01:34:37,973
And he wobbles into the ropes
and goes down!

1411
01:34:38,513 --> 01:34:41,311
Dauthuille is down,
and referee Lou Handler comes over

1412
01:34:41,416 --> 01:34:44,476
and starts the count.
He's trying to get up.

1413
01:34:44,586 --> 01:34:46,281
Six... seven...

1414
01:34:46,388 --> 01:34:49,880
He'll never make it.
Nine... ten!

1415
01:34:49,992 --> 01:34:51,016
You're out!

1416
01:34:51,126 --> 01:34:52,457
It is all over!

1417
01:34:52,561 --> 01:34:54,688
He is knocked out,
and Jake La Motta,

1418
01:34:54,796 --> 01:34:57,492
with 13 seconds left to go
in the final round,

1419
01:34:57,599 --> 01:35:00,067
has made one of the most
remarkable comebacks

1420
01:35:00,168 --> 01:35:02,830
- in all boxing history.
- Jake La Motta!

1421
01:35:08,043 --> 01:35:09,169
Come on.

1422
01:35:09,878 --> 01:35:12,176
Just tell him you're sorry,
you miss him.

1423
01:35:17,219 --> 01:35:20,347
He's your brother, you have to
talk to him sooner or later.

1424
01:35:27,829 --> 01:35:30,229
I'll dial him for you,
then you talk to him.

1425
01:35:30,332 --> 01:35:33,199
Just tell him you're sorry,
then you can say whatever you want.

1426
01:35:46,515 --> 01:35:47,641
Go ahead.

1427
01:35:59,027 --> 01:36:00,995
Hey, champ-- like to ask
you a few questions.

1428
01:36:01,096 --> 01:36:03,496
- Not now.
- I been waitin' an hour for you.

1429
01:36:03,598 --> 01:36:06,226
- Excuse me, my wife is--
- There's a great angle here...

1430
01:36:06,334 --> 01:36:08,996
Don't bother me, please.
Get outta here.

1431
01:36:09,104 --> 01:36:10,332
Come on. All right, champ?

1432
01:36:10,439 --> 01:36:13,169
- You're a great guy.
- I asked you nice, will ya--?

1433
01:36:24,152 --> 01:36:25,278
Hello?

1434
01:36:31,993 --> 01:36:34,791
Salvy, this ain't
funny anymore.

1435
01:36:34,896 --> 01:36:35,954
Is that you?

1436
01:36:36,064 --> 01:36:38,965
I know somebody's there.
I can hear you breathin'.

1437
01:36:39,501 --> 01:36:40,798
You listenin'?

1438
01:36:40,936 --> 01:36:45,703
Your mother sucks
fuckin' big fuckin' elephant dicks.

1439
01:36:45,807 --> 01:36:47,274
You got that?

1440
01:37:35,891 --> 01:37:37,449
The fight of the year.

1441
01:37:37,559 --> 01:37:40,824
The next time that friendly bartender
says, "What'll you have?"

1442
01:37:40,929 --> 01:37:43,898
give him that answer the whole world
gives, "Pabst Blue Ribbon."

1443
01:37:47,335 --> 01:37:50,236
Those punches by La Motta
explain themselves.

1444
01:37:50,338 --> 01:37:53,569
They fought five times
between 1942 and 1945.

1445
01:37:53,675 --> 01:37:58,510
It has so far been a blazing bout
for the Middleweight Championship.

1446
01:37:59,181 --> 01:38:02,548
In that great action by La Motta,
he couldn't score the big one.

1447
01:38:02,651 --> 01:38:04,778
That's it,
that was his last shot.

1448
01:38:07,022 --> 01:38:09,889
Round number 13,
the hard-luck number.

1449
01:38:09,991 --> 01:38:11,583
There's the buzzer,

1450
01:38:11,693 --> 01:38:13,684
and I think you know
both the boys.

1451
01:38:24,206 --> 01:38:26,868
Robinson hurting La Motta,
he's hurting him now.

1452
01:38:29,878 --> 01:38:32,870
He has La Motta
on queer street, holding on.

1453
01:38:33,548 --> 01:38:36,244
Certainly, that was one
of the most damaging evidences

1454
01:38:36,351 --> 01:38:39,184
of punching that
you have seen in recent years.

1455
01:38:39,287 --> 01:38:41,016
Come on! Come on.

1456
01:38:46,328 --> 01:38:49,957
- What are you standin' there for?
- Robinson, apparently tired,

1457
01:38:50,065 --> 01:38:52,966
punched with a "fare thee well,"
and rocked Jake La Motta

1458
01:38:53,068 --> 01:38:54,729
- right to his heels.
- Come on, Ray, come on!

1459
01:40:01,636 --> 01:40:03,501
These are clean, whistling shots.

1460
01:40:03,605 --> 01:40:06,301
How he can survive them,
nobody knows.

1461
01:40:06,408 --> 01:40:08,638
No man can endure this pummeling!

1462
01:40:08,743 --> 01:40:11,507
The fight is stopped on...

1463
01:40:11,613 --> 01:40:14,343
the signal to Frankie Sikora.

1464
01:40:14,482 --> 01:40:17,417
Row after row after row
from the ring,

1465
01:40:17,519 --> 01:40:19,043
the crowd is standing and cheering,

1466
01:40:19,154 --> 01:40:22,180
as he just cannonaded
Jake La Motta

1467
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:25,316
- into a death defeat.
- Hey, Ray.

1468
01:40:25,427 --> 01:40:28,521
And when I say that, I mean
Jake wouldn't want to quit.

1469
01:40:28,630 --> 01:40:30,757
- He wanted to go.
- Hey, Ray.

1470
01:40:32,367 --> 01:40:33,891
Never went down, Ray.

1471
01:40:35,036 --> 01:40:37,004
You never got me down, Ray.

1472
01:40:37,872 --> 01:40:38,998
Ya hear me?

1473
01:40:39,674 --> 01:40:41,699
Never got me down.

1474
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:44,244
Yeah? See, look?

1475
01:40:44,346 --> 01:40:47,042
And in the thirteenth round,
the hard-luck round,

1476
01:40:47,148 --> 01:40:50,015
the championship of the world
has changed hands.

1477
01:40:50,885 --> 01:40:51,909
And there you see it...

1478
01:40:52,721 --> 01:40:55,189
a champion gone down to defeat.

1479
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:58,322
And so, now we wait
for the announcement

1480
01:40:58,426 --> 01:41:02,362
from Eddie Flint,
the ring announcer.

1481
01:41:03,064 --> 01:41:05,498
Then we'll get up in the ring,
join with the radio audience

1482
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,033
throughout the world,

1483
01:41:07,135 --> 01:41:09,695
and have a brief interview
with Ray Robinson.

1484
01:41:10,405 --> 01:41:13,397
Now we're waiting for the time
to be announced.

1485
01:41:13,508 --> 01:41:16,477
And it is being handed between
the commissioner and Eddie Flint.

1486
01:41:16,578 --> 01:41:18,910
The fight was stopped
on a signal from Joe Tryner--

1487
01:41:19,013 --> 01:41:20,981
Attention, ladies and gentlemen!

1488
01:41:21,082 --> 01:41:24,916
The winner by a technical knockout
in two minutes and four seconds

1489
01:41:25,019 --> 01:41:26,919
of the thirteenth round,

1490
01:41:27,021 --> 01:41:29,922
and the new World's Middleweight
Boxing Champion,

1491
01:41:30,024 --> 01:41:31,423
Sugar Ray Robinson!

1492
01:41:39,601 --> 01:41:40,966
Why are you pulling out
of Wednesday's fight?

1493
01:41:41,603 --> 01:41:43,833
It's over for me--
boxing's over for me.

1494
01:41:44,606 --> 01:41:45,698
I'm through.

1495
01:41:47,041 --> 01:41:48,668
I'm tired of worryin' about weight.

1496
01:41:48,777 --> 01:41:51,837
That's all I used to think about
was weight, weight, weight.

1497
01:41:51,946 --> 01:41:54,380
After a while, you realize
there are other things in life.

1498
01:41:54,482 --> 01:41:56,882
I'm very grateful.
Boxing's been good to me.

1499
01:41:56,985 --> 01:41:59,385
I got a nice house,
I got three great kids.

1500
01:41:59,788 --> 01:42:03,349
I got a wonderful, beautiful wife.
What more could I ask for?

1501
01:42:05,059 --> 01:42:07,550
- Hey, what's your name?
- Bob.

1502
01:42:07,662 --> 01:42:08,856
Take a picture, Bob.

1503
01:42:09,397 --> 01:42:11,627
Let him take a picture
of ya, honey-- for us.

1504
01:42:11,733 --> 01:42:13,360
Go ahead, smile.

1505
01:42:15,603 --> 01:42:16,797
Thank you, Bob.

1506
01:42:16,905 --> 01:42:19,703
Take a picture of all of us.
Jackie, come here, sit over here.

1507
01:42:23,978 --> 01:42:26,276
All right, everybody, smile. Smile.

1508
01:42:28,983 --> 01:42:31,349
Mrs. La Motta, how do you feel
about Jake's retirement?

1509
01:42:31,453 --> 01:42:32,681
I think it's great.

1510
01:42:32,787 --> 01:42:35,119
He picked the right time
to stop fightin'.

1511
01:42:35,223 --> 01:42:37,020
He's home with us
all the time now.

1512
01:42:37,158 --> 01:42:39,251
- It's really good.
- You know what? You through?

1513
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,920
- Excuse me, you through?
- Yeah.

1514
01:42:42,030 --> 01:42:44,191
I just bought a club
on Collins Avenue.

1515
01:42:44,299 --> 01:42:47,530
It's a bar, package store, everything.
Guess what I'm gonna call it?

1516
01:42:47,635 --> 01:42:48,602
I don't know.

1517
01:42:48,703 --> 01:42:50,500
- What are you gonna call it?
- Take a guess.

1518
01:43:03,218 --> 01:43:05,015
All right, shut up.
Enough, enough.

1519
01:43:07,055 --> 01:43:08,044
Thank you.

1520
01:43:13,795 --> 01:43:16,423
Just wanted to see
what the microphone

1521
01:43:16,531 --> 01:43:18,897
on a sexy girl sounds like.

1522
01:43:26,341 --> 01:43:27,638
See how that sounds.

1523
01:43:28,710 --> 01:43:30,177
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1524
01:43:30,278 --> 01:43:32,439
I haven't seen so many losers
since my last fight

1525
01:43:32,547 --> 01:43:34,014
at Madison Square Garden.

1526
01:43:36,684 --> 01:43:38,151
Okay, honey.

1527
01:43:39,354 --> 01:43:40,821
Thank you, doll.

1528
01:43:41,689 --> 01:43:43,816
- Isn't that somethin'?
- Bring us another drink.

1529
01:43:43,925 --> 01:43:45,552
- Salute.
- Salute.

1530
01:43:48,530 --> 01:43:49,895
Look at this terrific girl.

1531
01:43:49,998 --> 01:43:52,330
She's the kinda girl you
wanna bring home to your father,

1532
01:43:52,433 --> 01:43:54,731
especially if he's a degenerate.

1533
01:43:56,037 --> 01:43:57,163
Did I say that?

1534
01:43:59,507 --> 01:44:02,567
Nah, seriously, folks,
it's a thrill to be standing here

1535
01:44:02,677 --> 01:44:05,407
before all you
wonderful people tonight.

1536
01:44:05,513 --> 01:44:07,811
In fact, it's a thrill
to be standing.

1537
01:44:10,385 --> 01:44:13,411
If you believe it's a thrill to be standin'
before you wonderful people, then...

1538
01:44:13,521 --> 01:44:14,715
you're all full of shit.

1539
01:44:18,226 --> 01:44:20,592
By the way, me and my wife
Vickie's gettin' married.

1540
01:44:20,695 --> 01:44:22,925
What am I talkin' about?
I'm out of it.

1541
01:44:25,166 --> 01:44:27,600
Is she here?
She's not here.

1542
01:44:27,702 --> 01:44:29,533
Vickie?
Nah, she's not here.

1543
01:44:29,637 --> 01:44:32,299
By the way, me and my wife
Vickie's gonna celebrate--

1544
01:44:32,407 --> 01:44:34,875
it's a little different--
our 11th wedding anniversary.

1545
01:44:35,577 --> 01:44:37,204
Thank you.

1546
01:44:38,846 --> 01:44:40,541
That reminds me about
two friends of mine.

1547
01:44:40,648 --> 01:44:42,548
One was married,
one was single.

1548
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:45,050
The married guy
tells the single guy,

1549
01:44:45,153 --> 01:44:46,882
"What's the matter with you?

1550
01:44:47,055 --> 01:44:49,148
"What's the matter with you?
Look at me, and look at you.

1551
01:44:49,257 --> 01:44:52,055
And look at me,
and look at you."

1552
01:44:55,029 --> 01:44:56,496
Let me get on with it.

1553
01:44:57,131 --> 01:44:59,190
"When I come home at night,
my wife's at the door

1554
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:00,733
"with a tall drink in her hand.

1555
01:45:00,835 --> 01:45:02,962
"Then she gives me
a nice hot bath,

1556
01:45:03,071 --> 01:45:05,062
"then she gives me
a nice rubdown,

1557
01:45:05,173 --> 01:45:07,073
"then she makes
passionate love to me,

1558
01:45:07,175 --> 01:45:08,904
"and then she makes me
a nice dinner.

1559
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:11,570
What more could you ask for?
You oughta try that."

1560
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:14,204
The other friend says,
"Hey, that sounds great.

1561
01:45:14,315 --> 01:45:15,782
What time does
your wife get home?"

1562
01:45:20,888 --> 01:45:24,119
I know I'm no Olivier,
but if he fought Sugar Ray,

1563
01:45:24,225 --> 01:45:25,783
he would say

1564
01:45:25,893 --> 01:45:29,021
that the thing ain't the ring,

1565
01:45:29,130 --> 01:45:31,030
it's the play.

1566
01:45:31,833 --> 01:45:33,630
So give me a stage

1567
01:45:33,735 --> 01:45:36,033
where this bull here can rage,

1568
01:45:36,137 --> 01:45:38,037
and though I can fight,

1569
01:45:38,139 --> 01:45:40,539
I'd much rather
hear myself recite.

1570
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:48,142
That's entertainment!

1571
01:46:12,173 --> 01:46:13,970
Jake, how have you been?

1572
01:46:16,044 --> 01:46:19,104
Hey!
You were just great.

1573
01:46:19,247 --> 01:46:21,772
It's a good thing Sugar Ray
wasn't here tonight, huh?

1574
01:46:21,883 --> 01:46:24,875
- He told that joke last week.
- Come on!

1575
01:46:24,986 --> 01:46:27,454
He repeats himself,
gettin' a little senile.

1576
01:46:28,256 --> 01:46:30,554
I'd like you to meet
State's Attorney Bronson.

1577
01:46:30,658 --> 01:46:32,785
- How are ya? Nice to meet you.
- And his wife.

1578
01:46:32,894 --> 01:46:34,327
- Nice to meet you.
- You shouldn't be here this week.

1579
01:46:34,429 --> 01:46:37,830
It's next week we got
the shakedown payments, right?

1580
01:46:39,133 --> 01:46:41,431
It's good seein' you.

1581
01:46:41,569 --> 01:46:42,797
That is a joke, right?

1582
01:46:42,904 --> 01:46:45,134
It's a joke--
only you know if it's a joke.

1583
01:46:45,239 --> 01:46:46,866
He's just kidding, right?

1584
01:46:47,408 --> 01:46:48,841
All right,
we'll talk about it later.

1585
01:46:49,577 --> 01:46:51,704
- This is your wife?
- Yes, Mrs. Bronson.

1586
01:46:51,813 --> 01:46:53,610
Very pretty lady.
Charmed to meet you.

1587
01:46:53,715 --> 01:46:55,580
- Thank you.
- He's really a nice guy.

1588
01:46:55,683 --> 01:46:57,981
You can take a joke,
can't you, doll?

1589
01:47:00,121 --> 01:47:01,782
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1590
01:47:03,624 --> 01:47:06,650
Hey, Carlo? Carlo!

1591
01:47:07,528 --> 01:47:10,326
Give 'em another drink.
Somethin' happened over here.

1592
01:47:11,365 --> 01:47:13,925
- Darling, Linda, come here.
- Where's your wife?

1593
01:47:14,035 --> 01:47:15,332
- My wife?
- Yeah, why isn't she here?

1594
01:47:15,436 --> 01:47:16,994
What's it to you? You think
I'm gonna bring her around here,

1595
01:47:17,105 --> 01:47:20,131
- let you bums get involved with her?
- Come on!

1596
01:47:20,241 --> 01:47:22,471
Especially the State's Attorney
over here?

1597
01:47:22,577 --> 01:47:24,875
He comes here a lot,
darling, watch him.

1598
01:47:24,979 --> 01:47:26,537
He knows I'm only kiddin'.

1599
01:47:26,647 --> 01:47:28,615
- Thank you.
- Keep an eye on him.

1600
01:47:29,050 --> 01:47:30,278
What's the problem?

1601
01:47:30,384 --> 01:47:31,408
There's really not a problem.

1602
01:47:31,519 --> 01:47:34,386
She doesn't look 21,
so I just had to ask for some I.D.

1603
01:47:34,922 --> 01:47:36,549
- How old are you, honey?
- Twenty-one.

1604
01:47:36,657 --> 01:47:37,954
- Twenty-one?
- Mm-hmm.

1605
01:47:38,493 --> 01:47:40,324
Can you prove
that you're 21?

1606
01:47:40,428 --> 01:47:42,396
- Mm-hmm.
- Prove it to me.

1607
01:47:48,002 --> 01:47:51,403
Any girl that can kiss like that
can drink at my joint anytime.

1608
01:47:51,506 --> 01:47:52,803
What about you?
How old are you?

1609
01:47:52,907 --> 01:47:55,307
- Twenty-one.
- Can you prove that you're 21?

1610
01:47:55,409 --> 01:47:57,377
- Yes.
- Would you prove it to me?

1611
01:47:57,478 --> 01:47:58,775
Come here.

1612
01:48:10,858 --> 01:48:11,984
She's 21, too?

1613
01:48:13,027 --> 01:48:15,996
She has convinced me
that she's 21, too.

1614
01:48:32,146 --> 01:48:34,478
- Watch it while I'm pouring.
- Your wife's outside.

1615
01:48:34,582 --> 01:48:37,050
- She's waitin' for you.
- Why don't ya tell me a little louder?

1616
01:48:50,898 --> 01:48:52,195
There.

1617
01:48:57,672 --> 01:48:58,798
Come on, Jake.

1618
01:49:05,179 --> 01:49:07,113
Lonely nights

1619
01:49:08,282 --> 01:49:11,115
I'm so lonely

1620
01:49:11,652 --> 01:49:13,950
Please come home

1621
01:49:14,055 --> 01:49:18,355
You great big
lump of sugar

1622
01:49:18,893 --> 01:49:21,054
I miss you so much

1623
01:49:21,162 --> 01:49:22,993
Please come home

1624
01:49:23,097 --> 01:49:26,066
Lonely nights

1625
01:49:40,715 --> 01:49:43,183
It was a busy night last night.

1626
01:49:44,385 --> 01:49:47,013
- Everything all right?
- I'm leaving you, Jake.

1627
01:49:48,055 --> 01:49:50,546
- What else is new?
- No. I mean it this time.

1628
01:49:50,658 --> 01:49:52,956
I didn't wanna tell you
till I had everything worked out.

1629
01:49:55,730 --> 01:49:56,754
- Move over.
- Why?

1630
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:59,355
- So you can put your hands on me?
- Open the door.

1631
01:49:59,467 --> 01:50:00,934
Come on, honey,
open the door.

1632
01:50:01,035 --> 01:50:02,559
I got a lawyer,
we're gettin' a divorce

1633
01:50:02,670 --> 01:50:04,604
and I'm gettin'
custody of the kids.

1634
01:50:04,705 --> 01:50:07,731
- Let me in for a minute.
- No, I already made up my mind.

1635
01:50:08,276 --> 01:50:09,834
I'm leavin'. That's it.

1636
01:50:09,944 --> 01:50:12,572
Kids are gonna be with me,
and if you show your face around,

1637
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:13,977
I'm gonna call the cops on you.

1638
01:50:14,081 --> 01:50:16,515
- All right? That's it.
- Don't act that way, honey.

1639
01:50:43,010 --> 01:50:44,773
Come on, champ.
Come on, wake up.

1640
01:50:44,879 --> 01:50:45,971
Wake up, champ.

1641
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:50,574
What's up?

1642
01:50:52,386 --> 01:50:55,287
- We're from the D.A.
- Yeah, I know where you're from.

1643
01:50:55,389 --> 01:50:57,687
- They wanna talk with you.
- Youse all look the same to me.

1644
01:50:57,792 --> 01:51:00,192
- What's the difference?
- They wanna talk with you.

1645
01:51:00,294 --> 01:51:02,262
- About what?
- I don't know, I don't run the joint.

1646
01:51:02,363 --> 01:51:04,763
- They just told me to bring you in.
- But what do youse want?

1647
01:51:04,865 --> 01:51:05,991
For what?

1648
01:51:09,904 --> 01:51:11,769
Do you recognize this girl?

1649
01:51:13,541 --> 01:51:14,838
She been in the club?

1650
01:51:18,346 --> 01:51:20,644
- This is the same girl?
- Yeah.

1651
01:51:22,283 --> 01:51:24,046
Nah, I don't know her.

1652
01:51:24,151 --> 01:51:26,312
She says you introduced
her to some men.

1653
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:30,015
I introduced her to men. I introduce
a lot of people to a lot of people.

1654
01:51:30,124 --> 01:51:34,424
You tell me I introduced her to men.
I introduced him to men.

1655
01:51:34,962 --> 01:51:36,589
But I don't say nothin'.

1656
01:51:36,697 --> 01:51:39,598
She's 14. Come on,
put on your shoes, Jake.

1657
01:51:40,701 --> 01:51:42,532
- She's how old?
- Fourteen.

1658
01:51:42,636 --> 01:51:44,604
She's 14?
Let me see that.

1659
01:51:51,345 --> 01:51:52,869
Let me ask you somethin'.

1660
01:51:54,482 --> 01:51:57,110
You gonna tell me that
that girl looks 14?

1661
01:51:57,218 --> 01:51:59,345
- She's 14.
- I'm gonna ask you man to man.

1662
01:51:59,453 --> 01:52:02,581
What am I gonna say?
Come on, we gotta go.

1663
01:52:02,690 --> 01:52:05,056
- We gotta go downtown?
- That's right.

1664
01:52:05,726 --> 01:52:07,694
For what,
because of this girl?

1665
01:52:10,231 --> 01:52:12,358
- You drunk?
- Open the door, I'm out on bail.

1666
01:52:12,466 --> 01:52:15,299
I just gotta pick up one thing
and I'll leave, I promise.

1667
01:52:15,403 --> 01:52:17,098
- Kids are sleepin'.
- I won't bother them.

1668
01:52:17,204 --> 01:52:18,831
Let me just get somethin'.

1669
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:21,571
All right, don't make no noise.

1670
01:52:21,675 --> 01:52:22,664
- What?
- Don't make no noise.

1671
01:52:22,777 --> 01:52:24,904
I won't,
I just gotta get this one thing.

1672
01:52:27,681 --> 01:52:29,842
- What are you doin'?
- I gotta get $10,000.

1673
01:52:29,950 --> 01:52:31,850
My lawyer says if I can
spread 10,000 around,

1674
01:52:31,952 --> 01:52:34,182
- I can get the case dropped.
- They don't have a case against you.

1675
01:52:34,288 --> 01:52:35,585
Oh, no?
You kiddin' me, or what?

1676
01:52:35,689 --> 01:52:37,987
You ever see a 14-year-old
testify in court?

1677
01:52:40,528 --> 01:52:43,520
You saw the papers--
"La Motta Out on Vice Rap."

1678
01:52:43,631 --> 01:52:45,963
- What are you doin' to the belt?
- What difference does it make?

1679
01:52:47,134 --> 01:52:48,795
Can't you get the money
from your friends?

1680
01:52:48,903 --> 01:52:50,370
Yeah, what friends?

1681
01:52:51,072 --> 01:52:53,666
You're gonna wake my kids up!

1682
01:52:53,774 --> 01:52:56,140
You're gonna wake
the kids, stop it!

1683
01:53:03,551 --> 01:53:04,540
What's the matter with you?

1684
01:53:04,652 --> 01:53:07,143
Don't you put the dishes
so they don't fall down?

1685
01:53:07,254 --> 01:53:09,347
What about the belt,
Mr. La Motta?

1686
01:53:10,057 --> 01:53:12,287
Isn't that what you wanted
to sell me, the championship belt?

1687
01:53:12,393 --> 01:53:15,362
- These are the jewels from the belt.
- But where's the belt?

1688
01:53:15,463 --> 01:53:18,557
The belt of a champion
is a very rare item.

1689
01:53:18,666 --> 01:53:21,567
I wish you'd come to me
in the first place, Mr. La Motta.

1690
01:53:21,669 --> 01:53:23,034
You'd have had the belt
and the jewels together--

1691
01:53:23,137 --> 01:53:24,570
Give me 2,000 for them.

1692
01:53:24,672 --> 01:53:26,970
- Give me 2,000.
- 1,500 top, that's all--

1693
01:53:27,074 --> 01:53:29,975
- You can't give me 2,000?
- 1,500 top, Mr. La Motta.

1694
01:53:30,077 --> 01:53:32,978
- I'm sorry. I'd lose--
- Give me them.

1695
01:53:33,514 --> 01:53:35,482
Don't tell me you're not
gonna make a profit.

1696
01:53:35,583 --> 01:53:39,451
I know you're lyin'. Go around the corner,
I bet you I get twice what you're offerin'.

1697
01:53:40,855 --> 01:53:42,982
I can't raise the 10,000.

1698
01:53:44,191 --> 01:53:47,649
I tried, I tried.
I tried a lot of places.

1699
01:53:48,362 --> 01:53:49,829
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?

1700
01:53:50,865 --> 01:53:53,834
If that's what they're gonna do,
they're gonna do it, what can I do?

1701
01:53:55,369 --> 01:53:58,133
Then fuck 'em, let 'em do
what they're gonna do.

1702
01:54:00,374 --> 01:54:03,002
Get in the goddamn cell,
now, come on!

1703
01:54:03,110 --> 01:54:06,705
- That's right, can't hurt folks no more.
- This is where it's at right here.

1704
01:54:08,549 --> 01:54:11,109
Who was the one goddamn
tryin' to shirk, huh?

1705
01:54:11,218 --> 01:54:13,516
- You'll pull your load here, boy.
- That's right.

1706
01:54:13,621 --> 01:54:17,955
- I don't want no more!
- Get in the goddamn box!

1707
01:54:18,058 --> 01:54:21,186
I'll break you on one of
my fuckin' farms, you son of a bitch!

1708
01:54:21,295 --> 01:54:23,286
- Do you hear me?
- Go fuck yourself.

1709
01:54:23,397 --> 01:54:26,127
- Hold onto him just a minute!
- I got it.

1710
01:54:26,233 --> 01:54:27,700
See it? See it?!

1711
01:54:28,235 --> 01:54:30,863
Look at it, son!
Live in it!

1712
01:54:31,405 --> 01:54:33,532
Go on, boy, live in it!

1713
01:54:33,641 --> 01:54:36,439
- Do you understand that?
- On your mother's cunt, then!

1714
01:54:36,544 --> 01:54:37,670
Your mother's--!

1715
01:54:38,512 --> 01:54:40,571
- You cocksucker!
- Live in it!

1716
01:54:42,016 --> 01:54:45,975
Let that son of a bitch sit,
fuck him!

1717
01:54:46,353 --> 01:54:47,581
Fuck you!

1718
01:54:50,024 --> 01:54:51,651
Fuck your mother!

1719
01:55:28,662 --> 01:55:31,790
Dummy, dummy, dummy...

1720
01:55:38,505 --> 01:55:40,632
Why? Why? Why?

1721
01:56:00,194 --> 01:56:01,593
You motherfucker!

1722
01:56:13,874 --> 01:56:15,000
My hands!

1723
01:56:18,879 --> 01:56:20,107
Why'd you do it, why?

1724
01:56:20,214 --> 01:56:22,614
You're so stupid,
you're so stupid,

1725
01:56:22,716 --> 01:56:25,116
you're so fuckin' stupid!

1726
01:56:25,219 --> 01:56:27,619
You're so stupid.

1727
01:56:27,721 --> 01:56:30,554
They called me an animal.
I'm not an animal.

1728
01:56:30,658 --> 01:56:32,057
I'm not an animal.

1729
01:56:32,159 --> 01:56:36,562
Why do they treat me like this?
I'm not that bad. I'm not that bad.

1730
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:41,368
I'm not that guy.

1731
01:56:59,353 --> 01:57:03,312
Guy comes home, finds his wife
in bed with another guy, the wife says,

1732
01:57:03,424 --> 01:57:06,359
"Look who's here-- big mouth.
Now the whole neighborhood will know."

1733
01:57:08,028 --> 01:57:10,997
Thanks. Thanks for laughin'.
Spread it around a little bit.

1734
01:57:12,533 --> 01:57:14,933
The first night I was here,
I said to the owner of the joint,

1735
01:57:15,035 --> 01:57:18,004
I said, "Listen,
where's the toilet?"

1736
01:57:18,105 --> 01:57:19,572
He said, "You're in it."

1737
01:57:20,708 --> 01:57:22,699
Come on, let's go, let's go.

1738
01:57:22,810 --> 01:57:24,801
Why don't you leave me alone?
I'm tryin' to do my routine.

1739
01:57:24,912 --> 01:57:25,901
Up yours.

1740
01:57:26,980 --> 01:57:29,710
Pal, you're gonna force me
to make a comeback.

1741
01:57:29,817 --> 01:57:32,445
- Funny.
- Fuck you...

1742
01:57:33,153 --> 01:57:34,950
And the horse you rode in on.

1743
01:57:36,824 --> 01:57:38,951
And the whole cavalry behind ya.

1744
01:57:39,827 --> 01:57:40,953
Funny man.

1745
01:57:41,662 --> 01:57:43,289
That's why I'm here.

1746
01:57:45,999 --> 01:57:47,296
Give him another drink.

1747
01:57:47,835 --> 01:57:49,302
Piss in it for me.

1748
01:57:51,505 --> 01:57:54,406
I'm now gonna introduce a woman
who's made a worldwide tour

1749
01:57:54,508 --> 01:57:57,477
with top billing and all that
other bullshit where they all hated her.

1750
01:57:58,345 --> 01:58:00,074
And I want you all
to give her a warm welcome.

1751
01:58:00,180 --> 01:58:02,341
I know you're all capable of it.

1752
01:58:02,449 --> 01:58:04,417
You look like a bunch of junkies.

1753
01:58:05,352 --> 01:58:08,651
Her name is Emma 48's.

1754
01:58:11,024 --> 01:58:13,652
Oh, yeah! Go get it!

1755
01:58:28,542 --> 01:58:29,736
Taxi!

1756
01:58:41,588 --> 01:58:42,748
Honey...

1757
01:58:44,224 --> 01:58:45,919
Listen, I'm gonna take a little walk.

1758
01:58:46,026 --> 01:58:48,551
I got a couple of things
I gotta take care of, all right?

1759
01:58:48,662 --> 01:58:50,357
- Will I see you later?
- Yeah, here.

1760
01:58:51,899 --> 01:58:53,696
- Take that, I'll be home later.
- Thank you.

1761
01:58:55,402 --> 01:58:56,699
Be careful.

1762
01:59:11,251 --> 01:59:12,650
Hey, what are you doin'?

1763
01:59:12,753 --> 01:59:14,015
Joey.

1764
01:59:17,491 --> 01:59:19,789
Come on, Joey.
Why don't you turn around?

1765
01:59:32,139 --> 01:59:33,868
Come on, Joey,
turn around.

1766
01:59:33,974 --> 01:59:35,737
Hey, Joey, come on.

1767
01:59:48,889 --> 01:59:51,016
Come on, Joey?
What are you doin'?

1768
01:59:51,124 --> 01:59:54,218
Come on. What are you
gettin' so angry about?

1769
01:59:54,328 --> 01:59:56,125
Come on, be friends.

1770
01:59:56,230 --> 01:59:57,754
Come on, you're my brother.

1771
01:59:57,865 --> 01:59:59,355
- Be friends.
- I'm your brother?

1772
01:59:59,466 --> 02:00:02,094
Yeah, ya fuckin' bum.
Give me a break, come on.

1773
02:00:02,202 --> 02:00:03,294
- Kiss me.
- Come on, huh?

1774
02:00:03,403 --> 02:00:04,870
Give me a kiss, come on.

1775
02:00:05,405 --> 02:00:08,306
Wait, let me call my wife and kids.
Don't you want them to see the kiss?

1776
02:00:08,408 --> 02:00:11,866
You gonna forgive and forget?
It's a long time ago, forget about it.

1777
02:00:11,979 --> 02:00:13,446
Just give me a kiss, come on.

1778
02:00:14,248 --> 02:00:15,374
Come on.

1779
02:00:20,587 --> 02:00:23,147
You're my brother.
Come on.

1780
02:00:25,158 --> 02:00:26,625
Come on, give me a kiss.

1781
02:00:29,530 --> 02:00:31,157
- What?
- Come on.

1782
02:00:32,699 --> 02:00:34,599
- How's everything, all right?
- Good.

1783
02:00:34,701 --> 02:00:36,669
- Everything's all right?
- Yeah.

1784
02:00:37,538 --> 02:00:39,506
- Family?
- All right.

1785
02:00:43,710 --> 02:00:44,768
Come on.

1786
02:00:44,878 --> 02:00:46,846
You don't wanna
do this here, come on.

1787
02:00:47,881 --> 02:00:50,349
Let me call you,
we'll get together in a couple days.

1788
02:00:50,450 --> 02:00:52,418
- You'll call me?
- I will.

1789
02:00:53,053 --> 02:00:54,520
Don't forget.

1790
02:00:55,722 --> 02:00:58,020
- I'll call you.
- All right.

1791
02:01:09,469 --> 02:01:10,766
...won it legitimately...

1792
02:01:12,406 --> 02:01:15,898
...and nobody could take that
away from me, nobody.

1793
02:01:17,010 --> 02:01:19,069
Some people aren't that lucky.

1794
02:01:20,414 --> 02:01:24,043
Like the one that Marlon Brando
played in On the Waterfront.

1795
02:01:24,151 --> 02:01:26,813
an up-and-comer
who's now a down-and-outer.

1796
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:28,820
You remember that scene
in the back of the car

1797
02:01:28,922 --> 02:01:31,516
with his brother Charley,
a small-time racket guy?

1798
02:01:31,625 --> 02:01:33,422
And it went somethin' like this.

1799
02:01:36,863 --> 02:01:39,491
"It wasn't him, Charley, it was you.

1800
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:42,760
"You remember that night at the Garden,
you came to my dressing room

1801
02:01:42,869 --> 02:01:47,431
"and you said, 'Kid, this ain't your night.
We're goin' for the price on Wilson.'

1802
02:01:47,541 --> 02:01:50,271
"Remember that?
'This ain't your night.'

1803
02:01:50,377 --> 02:01:51,674
"My night.

1804
02:01:52,212 --> 02:01:54,680
"I could've taken
Wilson apart that night.

1805
02:01:54,781 --> 02:01:56,180
"So, what happens?

1806
02:01:56,283 --> 02:01:59,684
"He gets a title shot outdoors
in the ballpark, and what do I get?

1807
02:01:59,786 --> 02:02:01,947
"A one-way ticket to palookaville.

1808
02:02:02,055 --> 02:02:05,286
"I was never no good
after that night, Charley.

1809
02:02:05,392 --> 02:02:09,226
"It was like a peak you reach,
and then it's downhill.

1810
02:02:11,064 --> 02:02:12,691
"It was you, Charley.

1811
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:15,027
"You was my brother.

1812
02:02:15,569 --> 02:02:18,037
"You should've looked out
for me a little bit.

1813
02:02:18,572 --> 02:02:21,302
"You should've looked out
for me just a little bit.

1814
02:02:21,408 --> 02:02:24,468
"You should've taken care
of me just a little bit,

1815
02:02:24,578 --> 02:02:28,378
"instead of making me take
them dives for the short-end money.

1816
02:02:28,915 --> 02:02:30,712
"You don't understand.

1817
02:02:31,418 --> 02:02:34,979
"I could've had class.
I could've been a contender.

1818
02:02:35,088 --> 02:02:39,923
"I could've been somebody,
instead of a bum, which is what I am.

1819
02:02:40,027 --> 02:02:43,656
"Let's face it--
it was you, Charley.

1820
02:02:44,865 --> 02:02:47,493
- It was you, Charley."
- How you doin', Jake?

1821
02:02:48,035 --> 02:02:50,003
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

1822
02:02:50,704 --> 02:02:52,501
- Ready?
- You got about five minutes.

1823
02:02:53,373 --> 02:02:54,772
- You need anything?
- No.

1824
02:02:54,875 --> 02:02:56,001
You sure?

1825
02:02:57,044 --> 02:02:58,170
I'm sure.

1826
02:03:02,549 --> 02:03:05,677
- A lot of people out there?
- Yeah, it's crowded.

1827
02:03:26,339 --> 02:03:27,966
Go get 'em, champ.

1828
02:03:38,018 --> 02:03:39,986
I'm the boss, I'm the boss...

1829
02:03:38,018 --> 02:03:39,986
I'm the boss, I'm the boss...

1830
02:03:38,018 --> 02:03:39,986
I'm the boss, I'm the boss...
