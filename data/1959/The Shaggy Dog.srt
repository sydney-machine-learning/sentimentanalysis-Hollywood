00:01:58,014 --> 00:02:00,744
[Narrator] This is a shaggy dog story.

7
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:07,386
It could've happened anywhere
or to anyone.

8
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,393
It so happened that
it happened to Wilson Daniels.

9
00:02:13,463 --> 00:02:18,230
A man who loved people,
but hated dogs.

10
00:02:18,435 --> 00:02:21,233
Go on, get out of here. Get!

11

- Morning, dear.
- Good morning, dear.

13

Blast!

14
00:02:46,196 --> 00:02:47,220
Yes, dear?

15
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:50,232
Ridiculous!
Of all the sickly sentimentality.

Giving a medal to a dog.

17
00:02:51,902 --> 00:02:54,871
Don't get the paper in the butter, dear.

18
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:57,771
- Making a big hero out of him.
- What did he do?

19
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:01,299
Dragged a baby from a burning building.
Who couldn't do that?

20
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:03,107
Don't upset yourself, Wilson.

21
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,344
Dogs! Yapping and snapping
at a man's heels.

22
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:10,580
Man's best friend. If I ever find
the idiot who said that...

23
00:03:10,654 --> 00:03:13,555
You must remember, sweet,
that most people love dogs.

24
00:03:13,623 --> 00:03:16,023
I suppose I'm a freak because I don't.

25
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:18,617
It's nothing to be ashamed of, dear.

26
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:21,789
Frankly, I think that dogs
don't like mailmen because,

27
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:24,299
because sometimes they bring bad news.

28
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:26,927
Animals sense those things, you know.

29
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:31,673
Freeda, I am proud of the 20 years
I've spent in the mail service.

30
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:35,734
Neither snow, rain, sleet nor dogs
kept me from my appointed rounds,

31
00:03:35,812 --> 00:03:38,280
but those blasted dogs tried!

32
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:40,009
You were very brave.

33
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,847
- Where are the boys?
- They had breakfast early.

34
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,854
They're down in the cellar
tinkering with something.

35
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:47,913
- What with this time?
- I'm not sure.

36
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:51,188
Is there something called
an "issle interceptor"?

37
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:55,595
"Issle interceptor?"
You must mean "missile interceptor."

38
00:03:55,665 --> 00:04:00,193
I've been thinking, as long as you're
not taking a firm hand with Wilby,

39
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:04,263
- I've got to do something about it.
- What do you mean, dear?

40
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:06,809
That mess he got us into last week.

41
00:04:06,877 --> 00:04:09,675
- Which mess was that?
- The one where he had the police

42
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:13,341
throw the new dean of the divinity
school in jail as a public enemy.

43
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,940
Oh, well...

44
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:18,920
that was because of the picture on
the bulletin board in the post office.

45
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:22,314
It did look a little like the new dean.

46
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:24,952
Now, what I propose to do
about Wilby is...

47
00:04:26,062 --> 00:04:27,427
Missile interceptor!

49
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:35,863
Why is everything shaking?

50
00:04:46,116 --> 00:04:48,277
Maybe you better switch it off, Wilby.

51
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:51,115
How can I switch it off?
I haven't switched it on yet.

52
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,387
Maybe we better take it off
the launching site.

53
00:04:58,461 --> 00:04:59,894
Yeah, hurry!

54
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:06,966
Never mind, it's too late.

55
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:09,767
Get the upstairs area cleared.

go on outside now

58

and sort of hurry, please?

59
00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:28,416
Well, save something!

60
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,329
- Moochie, where's Wilby?
- He's still in the basement.

61

Well, I guess we've officially
entered the rocket age, eh, Pop?

64
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:13,198
It'd be great to be up there
riding it, wouldn't it, Pop?

65
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,834
I wish I was on it right now.

66
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,235
Wilson.

67
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,325
- Pop sure was sore.
- Yeah, I know.

68
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:38,793
I always seem
to rub him the wrong way.

69
00:06:46,703 --> 00:06:48,364
Wilby?

70
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,236
- Pop, how'd you get up here?
- I piled up some boxes.

71
00:06:52,308 --> 00:06:56,540
Wilby, I'm sorry, but I want you to get
rid of all that junk in the basement.

72
00:06:56,613 --> 00:06:58,080
- All, sir?
- All of it.

73
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:00,616
Dismantle the workshop,
bury the chemicals,

74
00:07:00,684 --> 00:07:03,175
- and give away those gadgets.
- Yes, sir.

75
00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:07,019
I want you to lose or give away
all the mice, hamsters, bats, crickets,

76

bugs, snails and whatever
plagues of mankind lurk down there.

77
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:15,996
Get off this roof, both of you, before
you fall off and ruin the flower beds.

78
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:18,591
Be careful, Pop,
those boxes look rickety.

79

- What about my seven bucks?

- What about it?
- Cough it up.

Look, I'm sorry, but you know how it is,
I got a date with Allison.

I'm sick and tired

Well... not exactly.

on the most popular girl in town?

going to play tennis?

Who are they, anyway?

He's the new assistant curator
at the county museum.

110

A man by the name of Andrassy.
Dr. Mikhail Andrassy.

Don't tell me how you get your gossip.
What else do you know?

114

Well, he's supposed to be
a well-known art expert.

115
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:13,069
He spent some time in a prison camp
after the war.

170
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:39,140
I better put it over here
out of the way.

171
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:43,617
Look at that.

172
00:13:45,254 --> 00:13:48,087
I've never seen Chiffon
take such a fancy to anyone.

173
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:51,149
He sure is friendly.

174
00:13:52,695 --> 00:13:55,528
- Who's she?
- Lucrezia Borgia.

175
00:13:55,598 --> 00:13:57,793
You remember the Borgias, of course.

176
00:13:57,867 --> 00:13:59,858
Sure, who?

177
00:13:59,936 --> 00:14:02,996
The Borgias were notorious
during the Dark Ages in Italy.

178
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:06,337
Some people say
the Borgia dabbled in black magic.

179
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:08,468
Black magic?

180
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:13,613
Hey! The dog in the picture
is the same kind as this one.

181
00:14:13,683 --> 00:14:16,174
Yes, a Bratislavian sheep dog.

182
00:14:16,252 --> 00:14:18,152
The breed has mostly died out now.

183
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:20,655
Chiffon is one of the few left.

184
00:14:20,723 --> 00:14:22,987
And it's very lonely for him.

185
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:27,319
Excuse me, Francesca.

186
00:14:27,396 --> 00:14:30,490
Would you be good enough
to take the Orsini artifacts

187
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:32,227
to Dr. Howard at the museum?

188
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:33,700
Certainly, father.

189
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:36,499
Why don't I drive you down there?
My car's outside.

190
00:14:36,572 --> 00:14:39,837
- Wait, we'll both take you.
- I'll get my purse.

191
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:43,106
What's the big idea?
I thought my driving made you nervous.

192
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:45,977
Look, the only thing about you
that makes me nervous

193
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:48,380
is my seven dollars,
if you know what I mean.

194
00:14:48,451 --> 00:14:52,353
All right, Wilby, if you want
to come along, glad to have you.

195
00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:53,718
Thank you.

196
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,723
- What a sweet little museum.
- It's not bad.

197
00:14:57,793 --> 00:15:01,229
I've put in a lot of time
around this place studying the arts.

198
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:03,595
Then how come you got lost
getting here?

199
00:15:05,735 --> 00:15:09,569
- Say, that's not a bad looking deal.
- [Answers in French]

200
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,507
Personally, I go in
for the old Egyptian stuff like that.

201
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,372
That figures.

202
00:15:21,884 --> 00:15:23,681
Francesca?

203
00:15:26,322 --> 00:15:28,187
Buzz?

204
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:31,622
Buzz?

205
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:40,866
Buzz?

206
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:05,190
Buzz!

207
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,645
Uh, uh!

208
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:31,482
[Laughs]

209
00:16:33,823 --> 00:16:36,986
- You scared me.
- You ought to be. Serves you right.

210
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:40,392
You shouldn't be wandering around
until the exhibit is open.

211
00:16:40,463 --> 00:16:42,192
I've worked nonstop to be ready.

212
00:16:42,265 --> 00:16:45,359
I'm sorry, Prof. Plumcutt.
I was looking for my friends.

213
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:46,696
You know me?

214
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:52,038
Why, of course!
It's Wilby Daniels, isn't it?

215
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:54,042
Yes, I used to deliver your paper.

216
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,578
That's right. So you did.

217
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,641
Or did you? Come to think of it,
I don't recall getting my papers lately.

218
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:04,876
No, sir. I gave up my route
two years ago.

219
00:17:04,954 --> 00:17:06,581
Oh.

220
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:09,887
That just goes to show
how often I read the newspaper.

221
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,757
Nothing interesting happens
to people these days.

222
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:16,696
Now in the delightfully evil days
of the Borgias here

223
00:17:16,766 --> 00:17:19,735
something interesting
happened to people every day.

224
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:26,334
Yes, sir. I guess they did, sir.
I'd better...

225
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:31,176
Wilby, do you realize this civilization
knew all about sorcery?

226
00:17:31,247 --> 00:17:35,206
Even about shape-shifting
and the casting of spells.

227
00:17:35,284 --> 00:17:36,945
What's shape-shifting?

228
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:39,317
Shape-shifting was the medieval art

229
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:42,824
of borrowing someone else's body
to live in for awhile.

230
00:17:43,592 --> 00:17:46,220
A most interesting practice.

231
00:17:46,295 --> 00:17:49,696
You've heard about people
being changed into cats, dogs

232
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:51,665
and other creatures, haven't you?

233
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:55,135
Professor, you don't believe
in this stuff, do you?

234
00:17:55,204 --> 00:18:00,767
Well, it may surprise you to hear,
my boy, that I do.

235
00:18:00,843 --> 00:18:03,835
Oh, I know people laugh
at these things today.

236
00:18:03,913 --> 00:18:08,111
But if they were honest,
they'd admit that there are moments

237
00:18:08,184 --> 00:18:12,245
on dark and lonely nights
when something stirs within us.

238
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:15,916
And reawakens
ancient fears and beliefs.

239
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:20,291
I'd better be going now.
I have to find my friends.

240
00:18:20,363 --> 00:18:23,491
Yes. Come in and see me again.
Look out!

241
00:18:29,338 --> 00:18:32,330
- Sorry.
- No, no. It's all right.

242
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:41,209
Look, Wilby...

243
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:44,684
Run along now, will you?
I'll take care of these.

244
00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:48,121
- You're sure it's all right?
- Yes, please. Please.

245
00:18:51,627 --> 00:18:55,393
Well, they say it takes all kinds.

246
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:10,906
- Then it's a date?
- It's a date.

247
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,242
Good deal.

248
00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:14,339
I wonder what happened to Wilby.

249
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:18,251
Don't worry about knothead,
he loves museums.

250
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,981
Bye now.

251
00:19:22,324 --> 00:19:24,258
[Tires screeching]

252
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:31,795
Hi, Wilby.

253
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:43,741
Who gets the mice and the hamsters?

254
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:47,249
Pete Hammers, he always wanted 'em.

255
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:51,082
Mickey Warren gave me a buck
for your chemistry stuff.

256
00:19:51,153 --> 00:19:53,644
I promised to throw in
Harry the Bat for free.

257
00:19:53,722 --> 00:19:56,020
What about ol' Zachary here?

258
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:59,788
I couldn't unload him.
Nobody wanted him.

259
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:02,592
Poor ol' Zach, I know just how you feel.

260
00:20:02,665 --> 00:20:06,567
Come on, Wilby,
quit feeling sorry for yourself.

261
00:20:06,635 --> 00:20:08,830
Pop'll get over it.

262
00:20:08,904 --> 00:20:11,134
Pop'll get over it, but I won't.

263
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:14,540
I'll still be the same mixed up guy
I've always been.

264
00:20:15,644 --> 00:20:19,876
All right, boys, time for bed.
If you haven't finished, do it tomorrow.

265
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:21,712
Be right up, Pop.

266
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:27,318
- You coming, Wilby?
- In a minute.

267
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:46,204
What the heck is this?

268
00:20:49,011 --> 00:20:51,070
How do you suppose...

269
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:54,877
I know. It must've fallen in when
I knocked over the professor's case.

270
00:20:57,286 --> 00:21:01,382
"In canis corpore transmuto."

271
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:03,789
Sounds like Latin.

272
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:06,589
Wish I knew more
than just first year Latin.

273
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,789
Canis, canis...

274
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,664
That's "dog." Dog.

275
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:18,298
"Into dog something," transmuto.

276
00:21:18,374 --> 00:21:22,310
"In canis corpore transmuto."

277
00:21:22,378 --> 00:21:26,109
"In canis corpore transmuto."

278
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:35,053
It's a transmuto and away we go

279
00:21:35,124 --> 00:21:37,388
With the do-si-do

280
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:06,951
Wait a minute.
What's going on here?

281
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:13,284
Stop! Wait, somebody,
whoever you are.

282
00:22:13,362 --> 00:22:15,387
I was just kidding!

283
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:23,336
Wilby.

284
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:25,532
Wilby, come on, now.
It's getting late.

285
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:37,212
No!

286
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:39,254
No!

287
00:22:46,195 --> 00:22:48,060
No!

288
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,654
No!

289
00:22:49,732 --> 00:22:51,222
No!

290
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,289
Wilby.

291
00:22:52,368 --> 00:22:53,892
- Yipe.
- Wilby.

292
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:55,493
Oh.

293
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:59,401
Wilby. Come on up now.
It's getting late.

294
00:22:59,475 --> 00:23:01,238
OK, Pop.

295
00:23:05,014 --> 00:23:08,745
You catching a cold? Your mother
told you to wear a sweater down here.

296
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:11,911
Sweater?
I've got a sweater.

297
00:23:11,987 --> 00:23:14,285
Come on up now.

298
00:23:19,561 --> 00:23:21,961
Oh, poor Pop.

299
00:23:22,031 --> 00:23:24,090
This'll kill him.

300
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,259
What'll I do?

301
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:28,462
Gosh, what'll I do?

302
00:23:29,838 --> 00:23:32,568
Professor Plumcutt! He'll know.

303
00:23:35,244 --> 00:23:37,576
Now, to get by Pop.

304
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,107
[Hums]

305
00:24:27,096 --> 00:24:28,791
[Wilby] Professor Plumcutt.

306
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:36,194
Hello, fella.

307
00:24:36,271 --> 00:24:37,738
I've gotta talk to you.

308
00:24:37,806 --> 00:24:40,001
You know, dogs are not allowed in here.

309
00:24:40,075 --> 00:24:43,841
I'm not a dog.
I'm Wilby Daniels.

310
00:24:46,315 --> 00:24:48,647
Wilby Daniels.

311
00:24:48,717 --> 00:24:50,617
Are you really?

312
00:24:51,787 --> 00:24:54,119
Well, well.

313
00:24:54,189 --> 00:24:55,656
I'm not surprised.

314
00:24:55,724 --> 00:24:58,352
The very first time I saw you,
I said to myself,

315
00:24:58,427 --> 00:25:01,021
"That boy's a potential shape-shifter."

316
00:25:01,096 --> 00:25:03,690
- Is that what happened to me?
- Of course.

317
00:25:03,766 --> 00:25:05,927
How on earth did you manage it?

318
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:09,198
I think this ring
had something to do with it.

319
00:25:11,807 --> 00:25:13,798
The Borgia ring.

320
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:17,510
Where did you find it?
I've looked everywhere for it.

321
00:25:18,113 --> 00:25:21,048
Well, uh, it fell in the cuff
of my trousers.

322
00:25:21,116 --> 00:25:23,107
Thank you very much for returning it.

323
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:25,915
It's a very rare and unusual ring.

324
00:25:25,988 --> 00:25:26,977
Professor!

325
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:29,319
- What's the matter?
- What about me?

326
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:31,086
What about you?

327
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,185
I don't want to be a dog.

328
00:25:33,262 --> 00:25:36,459
- You don't?
- No, of course not!

329
00:25:36,532 --> 00:25:38,932
Can't you help me?

330
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:41,094
Yes, but how?

331
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:46,301
Apparently, you've become involved
with some old spell cast upon this ring.

332
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,502
Probably by one of the Borgias.

333
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:52,340
It sounds just like them.

334
00:25:52,414 --> 00:25:53,881
But how do I get out of it?

335
00:25:53,949 --> 00:25:56,144
Don't ask me, my boy.
How should I know?

336
00:25:56,218 --> 00:25:58,118
There are all kinds of spells.

337
00:25:58,187 --> 00:26:00,621
Some of them break themselves
after awhile.

338
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:03,817
While others come and go
like a headache.

339
00:26:03,892 --> 00:26:05,291
- Come and go?
- Yes.

340
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,988
Sometimes you'll be a dog,
sometimes a boy.

341
00:26:08,063 --> 00:26:10,293
For hours at a time, sometimes longer.

342
00:26:10,365 --> 00:26:14,028
You never can tell,
that's what makes it so interesting.

343
00:26:14,102 --> 00:26:16,866
Well, how can I break the spell?

344
00:26:16,939 --> 00:26:19,066
An act of heroism might break the spell.

345
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:20,165
Heroism?

346
00:26:20,242 --> 00:26:23,109
Why, of course.
Why didn't I think of it first!

347
00:26:23,178 --> 00:26:27,376
Heroism has always been an important,
a most potent factor,

348
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:28,973
in the breaking of spells.

349
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:32,885
- Do you remember the hound of Florence?
- Hound of Florence? No, sir.

350
00:26:32,955 --> 00:26:36,857
Well, it's the famous story of a
young man who was changed into a dog,

351
00:26:36,925 --> 00:26:38,153
just as you have been.

352
00:26:38,227 --> 00:26:40,320
He was in love with a beautiful girl.

353
00:26:40,395 --> 00:26:45,560
One night he got into a terrible fight
defending her from an evil duke.

354
00:26:45,634 --> 00:26:48,569
The duke grabbed a dagger
and plunged it into the dog.

355
00:26:48,637 --> 00:26:50,400
The dog fell to the ground.

356
00:26:50,472 --> 00:26:54,169
As the poor little animal lay there
with the dagger deep in his heart,

357
00:26:54,243 --> 00:26:57,906
he suddenly changed back
into a man again.

358
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,880
Dagger in the heart?

359
00:26:59,948 --> 00:27:02,007
That'd kill me!

360
00:27:02,584 --> 00:27:06,577
No, you don't grasp
the point of the story.

361
00:27:06,655 --> 00:27:11,354
What I was trying to say is that
it is possible to break such a spell.

362
00:27:11,426 --> 00:27:14,862
Now you must excuse me, please.
I have work to do.

- Yeah, why?

Hey, Wilby, I had the funniest dream
last night.

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,643
[Moochie] Here, Wilby!

514
00:42:07,188 --> 00:42:09,418
Wilby. Here, Wilby.

515
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:10,821
Wilby.

516
00:42:10,892 --> 00:42:12,723
Here, boy.
[Whistles]

517
00:42:12,794 --> 00:42:14,261
Here, Wilby.

518
00:42:14,328 --> 00:42:16,489
Wilby. Here, boy.

519
00:42:16,564 --> 00:42:18,031
Here, Wilby.

520
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:20,260
Here, boy.
Here, Wilby.

521
00:42:21,469 --> 00:42:24,063
- Wilby?
- What do you think you're doing?

522
00:42:24,138 --> 00:42:26,106
Aw, gee.

523
00:42:26,174 --> 00:42:27,698
What's the matter?

524
00:42:27,775 --> 00:42:30,209
You're not a dog anymore.

525
00:42:30,344 --> 00:42:33,177
You were gonna put
this dog collar on me, weren't you?

526
00:42:33,247 --> 00:42:35,010
You don't have to get sore.

527
00:42:35,082 --> 00:42:37,607
Forget it.
I'm through with that dog business.

528
00:42:37,685 --> 00:42:39,414
You sure?

529
00:42:40,588 --> 00:42:42,078
No.

530
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,352
Where's Pop?

531
00:42:46,027 --> 00:42:48,689
He's in there.
Cleaning his gun.

532
00:42:53,534 --> 00:42:56,662
Well, I guess I'll have to hide these
for awhile.

533
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,201
- Did you wash your hands?
- Yep.

534
00:43:01,275 --> 00:43:04,870
Wilson, if you don't mind, we'll have
dinner early tomorrow night.

535
00:43:04,946 --> 00:43:07,210
We're all going
to the country club dance.

536
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:10,307
- Is my good suit clean?
- I had it done last week.

537
00:43:10,384 --> 00:43:14,252
Wilby, why don't you take a girl
to the dance?

538
00:43:14,322 --> 00:43:17,883
Wilby? He's a little young for dating,
isn't he?

539
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:22,020
Nonsense, just because you didn't
go out with girls until you were 23.

540
00:43:22,096 --> 00:43:24,326
That's not true. I was 20.

541
00:43:24,398 --> 00:43:26,298
Besides, I was shy.

542
00:43:27,602 --> 00:43:29,695
Well, Wilby can't exist in a vacuum.

543
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:33,001
Besides, you've already taken
all his hobbies away from him.

544
00:43:33,074 --> 00:43:36,043
I'd say it was a big jump
from bird's eggs to girls.

545
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:40,308
There is nothing wrong with girls.
They're character building.

546
00:43:41,382 --> 00:43:43,509
Why don't you ask Allison to the dance?

547
00:43:43,584 --> 00:43:46,485
Allison? Well, Buzz takes her
to all the dances.

548
00:43:46,554 --> 00:43:48,283
Oh. Then someone else.

549
00:43:48,356 --> 00:43:52,019
There must be dozens of lovely girls
who'd be delighted to go with you.

550
00:43:52,093 --> 00:43:55,187
Why does he have to take a girl?
Why can't he go with me?

551
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,697
That's a great idea, that is.

552
00:43:57,765 --> 00:44:00,893
Honey, why don't you take that new girl
down the street?

553
00:44:00,968 --> 00:44:02,993
Dr. Andrassy's daughter?

554
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:06,369
Francesca?
No, I wouldn't have a chance with her.

555
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,998
[Knocking]

556
00:44:08,075 --> 00:44:09,906
See who that is, will you, Wilby?

557
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:19,317
Wilby, could I talk to you
in private for a second?

558
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:28,055
You know, knothead... Wilby,
you're the best friend I have.

559
00:44:28,129 --> 00:44:30,063
Buzz, not a cent.

560
00:44:30,131 --> 00:44:33,191
Now, I don't come to see you
just when I need money.

561
00:44:34,568 --> 00:44:36,536
All right, I'm sorry.

562
00:44:37,171 --> 00:44:39,662
The point is, I do have a problem.

563
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,766
I'm supposed to take Allison
to the country club dance.

564
00:44:42,843 --> 00:44:43,832
I know.

565
00:44:43,911 --> 00:44:47,142
I happened to mention the dance
to Francesca.

566
00:44:47,214 --> 00:44:50,445
You know how it is.
She's a smooth worker.

567
00:44:50,518 --> 00:44:52,782
Before I knew it, I asked her to go too.

568
00:44:52,853 --> 00:44:54,980
Well, what do you want me to do?

569
00:44:55,056 --> 00:44:57,991
All you have to do is come
and make a foursome out of it.

570
00:44:58,059 --> 00:45:00,653
You don't have to be with anybody.

571
00:45:00,728 --> 00:45:01,956
I don't get you.

572
00:45:02,596 --> 00:45:06,327
Don't you see I'll handle it,
so both girls think they're with me.

573
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,867
Then everybody's happy.

574
00:45:07,935 --> 00:45:11,166
I don't see how that makes me happy.

575
00:45:11,238 --> 00:45:13,468
Sure you do, it's fun.

576
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:16,772
We're playing a harmless little joke
on the girls.

577
00:45:16,844 --> 00:45:18,277
What do you say?

578
00:45:20,348 --> 00:45:23,340
Anything's better than going
with my little brother.

579
00:45:23,417 --> 00:45:25,544
I just don't see how it's going to work.

580
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:29,350
Well, you just come along and watch
the old master at work, buddy pal.

581
00:45:31,726 --> 00:45:33,216
Oh.

582
00:45:34,295 --> 00:45:36,593
Say, I'll need gas
for tomorrow night.

583
00:45:36,664 --> 00:45:39,292
You don't happen
to have a buck on you, do you?

584
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:48,331
- How nice you look, Wilby!
- Thank you. So do you.

585
00:45:48,409 --> 00:45:49,967
Thank you.

586
00:46:19,073 --> 00:46:23,976
Don't bother getting out, Wilby.
I'll get your date for you.

587
00:46:24,045 --> 00:46:27,606
Imagine, taking the prettiest girl
in town to the dance.

588
00:46:29,383 --> 00:46:31,374
Well, you know...

589
00:46:31,452 --> 00:46:34,649
Francesca certainly seems
to find you attractive.

590
00:46:36,157 --> 00:46:37,317
You really think so?

591
00:46:37,391 --> 00:46:41,919
Of course, I'm not as sophisticated
as she is,

592
00:46:41,996 --> 00:46:46,592
but there is something about you lately.
Something unusual.

593
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:48,498
[Door closes]

594
00:46:52,306 --> 00:46:54,570
- You girls know one another.
- Of course.

595
00:46:54,642 --> 00:46:56,371
- Hello, Wilby.
- Hi, Francesca.

596
00:46:56,444 --> 00:46:58,935
I think you both better
ride up front with me.

597
00:46:59,013 --> 00:47:01,504
The wind in the back
is murder on the hair.

598
00:47:01,582 --> 00:47:03,743
You're so thoughtful, Buzz.

599
00:47:03,818 --> 00:47:06,616
[Speaks French]

600
00:47:06,687 --> 00:47:09,315
Sorry, I don't speak French.

601
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,688
Oh.

602

[Swing music plays]

603
00:47:34,048 --> 00:47:36,278
Allison, will you do something for me?

604
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,908
What is it?

605
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:42,615
Well, you know, this is Wilby's first
dress-up date, and he's scared stiff.

606
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:45,352
- Scared of what?
- Francesca.

607
00:47:46,293 --> 00:47:48,659
That's silly. She's his date, isn't she?

608
00:47:48,729 --> 00:47:53,564
Sure, but you know how shy he is.
Francesca's kind of spectacular.

609
00:47:53,634 --> 00:47:57,502
- It's got him tied up in knots.
- So?

610
00:47:57,571 --> 00:48:00,563
I thought if you could dance
the first dance with him...

611
00:48:00,641 --> 00:48:03,337
You're old friends.
It might break the ice for him.

612
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:06,345
Since when are you
so concerned about Wilby?

613
00:48:06,413 --> 00:48:08,677
I like to see everyone happy.

614
00:48:09,483 --> 00:48:12,111
Thanks, Allison, you're a real doll.

615
00:48:16,056 --> 00:48:19,150
Wilby, aren't you and Allison
gonna have the first dance?

616
00:48:19,226 --> 00:48:21,854
Sure, how 'bout it, Allison?
Wanna dance?

617
00:48:21,929 --> 00:48:23,362
Love to.

618
00:48:25,633 --> 00:48:27,760
- Shall we?
- Oui.

619
00:48:32,673 --> 00:48:34,732
They're sweet together, aren't they?

620
00:48:38,646 --> 00:48:42,275
- That's what makes it so tough.
- What does?

621
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:45,045
Well, Wilby's got a tremendous crush
on Allison.

622
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,110
Trouble is, he's so shy.

623
00:48:47,188 --> 00:48:50,715
Allison goes more
for the sophisticated type.

624
00:48:51,525 --> 00:48:54,016
She can't see Wilby for sour apples.

625
00:48:54,094 --> 00:48:56,619
Boy! He is very nice, isn't he?

626
00:48:56,697 --> 00:49:00,394
Don't you worry,
there's nothing you can do about it.

627
00:49:04,438 --> 00:49:09,569
- Buzz, I have a rather amusing idea.
- What's that?

628
00:49:09,643 --> 00:49:13,909
Suppose I make a little fuss over Wilby
and pretend to be interested in him.

629
00:49:13,981 --> 00:49:16,074
What, you mean make Allison jealous?

630
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:20,746
- Oh, just a little bit.
- Why, you're a genius.

631
00:49:20,821 --> 00:49:23,949
I never would've thought of that
in a million years.

632
00:49:30,664 --> 00:49:33,497
Next number will be a ladies' tag dance.

633
00:49:50,017 --> 00:49:51,382
Tag dance.

634
00:49:52,152 --> 00:49:53,949
It's customary.

635
00:50:04,632 --> 00:50:07,396
The custom, is it not?

636
00:50:24,151 --> 00:50:27,484
- What's the big idea?
- You told me to break the ice.

637
00:50:27,554 --> 00:50:30,216
Fine, break it. Don't melt it.

638
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:32,054
Excuse me.

00:50:47,508 --> 00:50:48,805
It's amazing.

All those pretty girls actually seem
to enjoy dancing with Wilby.

00:50:52,546 --> 00:50:53,570
Why not?

642
00:50:53,647 --> 00:50:57,310
I'd have bet anything he was going to be
the all American wallflower.

643
00:50:57,384 --> 00:51:01,184
There are a lot of things about your son
that you don't know.

644
00:51:02,222 --> 00:51:05,919
The next number is a Paul Revere.

645

- Shall we, dear?
- Love to!

646

00:52:41,588 --> 00:52:43,453
- What's the big idea?
- Get down!

652
00:52:43,524 --> 00:52:47,153
- Don't give me trouble, Mooch.
- You've got it. Look at yourself!

00:52:49,129 --> 00:52:50,596
Oh, no! No!

Oh, boy, you're a dog again!

What are you so happy about?

658
00:53:15,889 --> 00:53:16,913
Gosh, Wilby.

659
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:20,448
You're a lot more fun as a dog
than you are as my brother.

660
00:53:20,527 --> 00:53:22,791
Shut up, and get me out of here.

661
00:53:22,863 --> 00:53:26,458
OK, boy, I don't want anything
to happen to you now.

What in the world is he doing here?

00:53:50,357 --> 00:53:51,688
- Who?
- Chiffon.

- Get him, Buzz.
- Oh, yeah.

00:54:11,512 --> 00:54:15,175
There's that blasted dog again.
Get away! What's he doing here?

670
00:54:16,049 --> 00:54:19,450
- See you later, boy.
- Look out!

671
00:54:20,654 --> 00:54:22,588
Come here, you mangy mutt!

672
00:54:25,192 --> 00:54:27,251
Come here.

673
00:54:35,702 --> 00:54:38,000
Come on, Moochie.

675
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:45,776
Hello? Wilby, where are you?

676
00:54:45,846 --> 00:54:48,212
- Pop!
- Just a minute. It's a little late.

677
00:54:48,282 --> 00:54:50,580
- Isn't time you get home?
- Is he all right?

678
00:54:50,651 --> 00:54:53,119
Yes, he's all right.

679
00:54:53,186 --> 00:54:57,088
We wondered where you went. I suppose
you went chasing after the dog too.

680
00:54:59,026 --> 00:55:01,221
Is it all right if you stay
at Buzz' house?

681
00:55:01,295 --> 00:55:03,763
- It's all right, Pop.
- Yes, it's all right.

682
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:19,103
Hey, Kelly, got a dime for the phone?

683
00:55:54,681 --> 00:55:57,548
Whoops.
Sorry, Officer Hansen. Bye.

684
00:55:57,618 --> 00:55:58,710
[Phone clinking]

685
00:56:12,165 --> 00:56:14,395
Kelly, here's your dime.
Can we go now?

686
00:56:14,468 --> 00:56:17,801
- I thought you were calling home.
- I changed my mind. Let's go.

687
00:56:17,871 --> 00:56:22,740
- You said it was important.
- I know what I said. It was a whim.

688
00:56:22,809 --> 00:56:26,768
Sometimes I'm just full of little whims.
Can we go now, please?

689
00:56:26,847 --> 00:56:29,407
- But, you said...
- Forget it, I said! Forget it.

690
00:56:29,483 --> 00:56:32,509
All right, I'll forget it.

691
00:56:40,861 --> 00:56:43,022
Don't bother, Buzz.

692
00:56:44,931 --> 00:56:48,958
- Good night. I hope you find your dog.
- Thank you, Allison. Good night.

693
00:56:49,036 --> 00:56:50,765
Good night.

694
00:56:50,837 --> 00:56:52,634
[Tires screeching]

695
00:56:58,345 --> 00:57:02,042
In the words of your charming
other date, don't bother!

696
00:57:02,115 --> 00:57:06,211
- Wait, I can explain everything!
- Good night.

697
00:57:06,286 --> 00:57:08,413
Well, that's gratitude for you.

698
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:12,283
I beg your pardon?

699
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:15,760
Here I almost break my neck
trying to catch that dog of yours.

700
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:19,265
He drags me all over a parking lot
and you won't even listen to me.

701
00:57:19,332 --> 00:57:20,594
So?

702
00:57:20,667 --> 00:57:23,192
Besides that I have
a very deep cut over my eye

703
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:26,967
and it'll probably be infected
by the time I get home.

704
00:57:28,508 --> 00:57:31,841
Oh, well.
I guess I don't blame you.

705
00:57:32,946 --> 00:57:35,574
Come on inside. I'll clean your scratch.

706
00:57:35,649 --> 00:57:37,674
Now you're talking.

707
00:57:42,456 --> 00:57:43,980
What the...

708
00:57:50,097 --> 00:57:51,928
What a night!

709
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,698
- Is Chiffon here?
- Yes, he just came home.

710
00:57:55,769 --> 00:57:58,704
- He's in the kitchen.
- I'm quite displeased with you.

711
00:57:58,772 --> 00:58:01,400
I distinctly asked you
to keep Chiffon locked up.

712
00:58:01,475 --> 00:58:02,772
I did my best.

713
00:58:02,843 --> 00:58:05,937
I left him in the kitchen,
locked the doors, he escaped.

714
00:58:06,012 --> 00:58:07,877
We won't discuss it now.

715
00:58:10,417 --> 00:58:13,113
Please go and sit down.
I want to check on Chiffon.

716
00:58:13,186 --> 00:58:15,711
Will you forget
about that mutt for once?

717
00:58:15,789 --> 00:58:18,815
Like I said, it's Wilby's fault
that I got into this mess.

718
00:58:18,892 --> 00:58:21,725
- Wilby's?
- Yeah, it's all his fault.

719
00:58:21,795 --> 00:58:25,162
Because I have a soft heart.
I was trying to do him a favor.

720
00:58:25,232 --> 00:58:26,859
Ouch. That stings.

721
00:58:26,933 --> 00:58:28,924
There, it's all done now.

722
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:33,767
Wilby didn't have enough nerve
to get himself a date.

723
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,705
So, he cooked up this whole thing.

724
00:58:35,776 --> 00:58:37,607
Why are you blaming this on Wilby?

725
00:58:37,677 --> 00:58:41,807
Don't let him fool you.
He's not as dumb as he looks.

726
00:58:41,882 --> 00:58:44,146
Behind that simple face...

727
00:58:44,217 --> 00:58:48,916
Well, I don't want to talk
about my best friend like that.

728
00:58:48,989 --> 00:58:50,923
Let's talk about us.

729
00:58:50,991 --> 00:58:54,722
You know, Francesca,
I've never met a girl like you.

730
00:58:55,595 --> 00:58:59,361
No, I'm not kidding.
There's something about you...

731
00:58:59,432 --> 00:59:01,059
[barks loudly]

732
00:59:01,668 --> 00:59:02,828
Chiffon!

733
00:59:02,903 --> 00:59:06,999
There you are.
What a bad dog you've been.

734
00:59:07,073 --> 00:59:10,770
Running away again and scaring
poor Francesca half to death.

735
00:59:10,844 --> 00:59:12,607
Bad boy!

736
00:59:13,547 --> 00:59:16,209
I sure hate to see you
waste all that on a mutt.

737
00:59:16,283 --> 00:59:17,375
Why?

738
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:19,384
What do you mean?

739
00:59:19,452 --> 00:59:21,784
I mean, forget about tonight.

740
00:59:21,855 --> 00:59:24,050
Forget Wilby and the whole mess.

741
00:59:24,124 --> 00:59:27,059
Like I said before,
let's talk about us.

742
00:59:28,428 --> 00:59:29,918
You know, Francesca...

743
00:59:29,996 --> 00:59:33,159
- the first time I saw you...
- [dog growls]

744
00:59:33,233 --> 00:59:38,193
I said to myself,
"Buzz, there's just the girl for..."

745
00:59:38,271 --> 00:59:39,761
[growling]

746
00:59:44,644 --> 00:59:47,579
Does he have to keep
looking at me like that?

747
00:59:49,015 --> 00:59:53,008
Look, fella, I've had just
about enough trouble for one night.

748
00:59:53,086 --> 00:59:54,110
Now, beat it!

749
00:59:54,187 --> 00:59:56,121
[Barks]

750
01:00:02,963 --> 01:00:04,863
Would you get lost!

751
01:00:06,366 --> 01:00:07,594
Buzz!

752
01:00:08,068 --> 01:00:10,229
Hey, what's the big idea?

753
01:00:10,937 --> 01:00:13,565
Get off, will you? Francesca!

754
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,937
Chiffon, stop it!

755
01:00:15,008 --> 01:00:16,703
He flipped his lid.

756
01:00:17,544 --> 01:00:18,533
Let go!

757
01:00:19,713 --> 01:00:21,476
Get him off me.

758
01:00:21,548 --> 01:00:24,346
What has got into you?
Now stop it this instant.

759
01:00:24,417 --> 01:00:26,248
I think you'd better leave, Buzz.

760
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:30,813
OK, I'm beginning to get the point.
Your dog doesn't like me.

761
01:00:30,891 --> 01:00:32,483
I'm sorry.

762
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:35,392
That's OK.
I can find my own way out.

763
01:00:36,429 --> 01:00:37,862
Bad dog you!

764
01:00:37,931 --> 01:00:39,489
- Good night.
- Good night.

765
01:00:41,234 --> 01:00:45,466
You behaved very badly tonight, Chiffon.
Buzz is really a nice boy.

766
01:00:46,706 --> 01:00:50,005
A little, shall we say, conceited?
Come on.

767
01:01:00,654 --> 01:01:01,643
Yes?

768
01:01:04,057 --> 01:01:07,493
- I just wanted to say good night.
- Did you have a pleasant time?

769
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,460
Yes, thank you.

770
01:01:09,529 --> 01:01:12,464
The odd thing was I found Chiffon
at the dance.

771
01:01:12,532 --> 01:01:13,897
Chiffon was there?

772
01:01:13,967 --> 01:01:17,164
I don't understand
how he keeps getting out of the house.

773
01:01:17,237 --> 01:01:20,172
- May I leave him with you tonight?
- Certainly, dear.

774
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:24,176
- I'm sure he won't get away from me.
- [Doorbell rings]

775
01:01:24,244 --> 01:01:26,303
- Good night, Francesca.
- Good night.

776
01:01:27,714 --> 01:01:29,944
Now you behave yourself!

777
01:01:30,016 --> 01:01:33,008
You stupid, wonderful dog!

778
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:48,665
Thurm, what is the meaning of this?

779
01:01:48,735 --> 01:01:50,862
You were asked
not to come here at night.

780
01:01:50,937 --> 01:01:53,201
It's most urgent,
I dare not use the phone.

781
01:01:53,273 --> 01:01:55,468
Is anything wrong at the missile plant?

782
01:01:55,542 --> 01:01:59,171
On the contrary, good news.
I've been transferred to section 32.

783
01:01:59,245 --> 01:02:02,612
Section 32? Excellent!

784
01:02:02,682 --> 01:02:05,810
With what I've given you,
this should be all you need.

785
01:02:05,885 --> 01:02:07,375
How soon can you get it here?

786
01:02:07,454 --> 01:02:10,617
Taking all precautions,
I'd say tomorrow night by 8:00.

787
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:12,920
That means that the complete mechanism

788
01:02:12,993 --> 01:02:15,985
of the undersea hydrogen missile
will be in our hands.

789
01:02:16,062 --> 01:02:18,792
- Yes, sir.
- Now we must get it out of the country.

790
01:02:18,865 --> 01:02:20,355
Immediately!

791
01:02:25,438 --> 01:02:26,598
Oh, no, you don't.

792
01:02:26,673 --> 01:02:28,766
No, you don't, my friend.

793
01:02:28,842 --> 01:02:31,367
You're not getting out
of this house tonight.

794
01:02:31,444 --> 01:02:34,504
All right, up on the couch. Up!

795
01:02:37,684 --> 01:02:39,049
Good night, Thurm.

796
01:02:39,619 --> 01:02:42,110
I'll expect you tomorrow night at 8:00.

797
01:02:54,067 --> 01:02:57,503
I certainly would like to know
what has gotten into you lately.

798
01:03:23,263 --> 01:03:24,855
Spies!

799
01:03:24,931 --> 01:03:26,922
I've got to tell somebody.

800
01:03:29,769 --> 01:03:31,669
I've got to get out of here.

801
01:03:44,851 --> 01:03:46,443
The laundry chute.

802
01:03:49,722 --> 01:03:51,553
Well, here it goes.

803
01:04:45,245 --> 01:04:47,372
Easy. Easy.

804
01:05:11,204 --> 01:05:13,297
What'll I do now?

805
01:05:18,344 --> 01:05:20,369
- [Moochie] Hi, Pop.
- Wilby home yet?

806
01:05:20,446 --> 01:05:22,277
No, sir.

807
01:05:24,517 --> 01:05:27,281
What's this you're reading?

808
01:05:29,956 --> 01:05:31,685
How To Train Your Dog?

809
01:05:33,226 --> 01:05:36,957
Gosh, Pop. I thought some day you
might change your mind about dogs.

810
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:38,691
Let me tell you something.

811
01:05:38,765 --> 01:05:42,394
As long as I've got a mind,
there'll never be a dog in this house.

812
01:05:42,468 --> 01:05:43,958
How to train...

813
01:05:52,712 --> 01:05:53,838
There.

814
01:06:19,505 --> 01:06:20,870
Hey, Mooch.

815
01:06:27,981 --> 01:06:30,882
- Is that you, Wilby?
- Who'd you think it was?

816
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:33,180
Gosh, boy, I've been worried about you.

817
01:06:33,253 --> 01:06:35,551
Will you stop patting me?
I don't like it.

818
01:06:35,622 --> 01:06:39,820
- Where you been?
- We've gotta get some help and fast.

819
01:06:39,892 --> 01:06:41,655
That house is full of spies.

820
01:06:41,728 --> 01:06:44,822
Spies! Swell, that'll be fun playing.

821
01:06:44,897 --> 01:06:47,889
This isn't a game. It's serious.

822
01:06:47,967 --> 01:06:50,026
Aw, Wilby.

823
01:06:50,103 --> 01:06:53,436
Listen, they're stealing something
from the missile plant.

824
01:06:53,506 --> 01:06:54,973
The missile plant?

825
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:56,872
I don't know what it is, exactly.

826
01:06:56,943 --> 01:07:00,208
But they call it, uh, Section 32.

827
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:03,147
They're sending it
out of the country tonight.

828
01:07:03,216 --> 01:07:05,741
Wow! I'd better tell Pop.

829
01:07:05,818 --> 01:07:08,685
- Pop?
- Sure, he'll know what to do.

830
01:07:08,755 --> 01:07:11,121
You just stay out of sight.

831
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:12,384
OK.

832
01:07:22,101 --> 01:07:24,626
Pop, can I talk to you for a minute?

833
01:07:24,704 --> 01:07:25,966
Certainly, what is it?

834
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:29,668
Will you please put down that paper?
It's very urgent.

835
01:07:30,443 --> 01:07:31,535
All right.

836
01:07:31,611 --> 01:07:34,375
- I just found out something.
- What did you find out?

837
01:07:34,447 --> 01:07:38,281
You know those people down the street,
Dr. Andrassy and them?

838
01:07:39,018 --> 01:07:40,542
They're spies.

839
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:43,589
Spies, huh? Well.

840
01:07:43,656 --> 01:07:48,025
Pop, I'm not kidding. They're stealing
something from the missile plant.

841
01:07:48,094 --> 01:07:50,062
Something called Section 32.

842
01:07:50,129 --> 01:07:54,122
Section 32? That's very interesting.

843
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,361
But, Pop, you gotta believe me.

844
01:07:56,436 --> 01:07:58,529
We gotta do something about it.

845
01:07:58,604 --> 01:08:02,597
I'm surprised at you. I knew we had
one woolly-headed son in this family...

846
01:08:02,675 --> 01:08:04,404
Wilby isn't woolly-headed!

847
01:08:04,477 --> 01:08:06,445
He's the one that heard 'em talking.

848
01:08:06,512 --> 01:08:10,312
He's the one that heard it.
That explains the whole thing.

849
01:08:10,383 --> 01:08:12,146
Run along now, Moochie.

850
01:08:12,218 --> 01:08:14,448
But, Pop, we can't just
let 'em get away.

851
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:15,919
Run along.

852
01:08:16,222 --> 01:08:17,746
Pop...

853
01:08:18,858 --> 01:08:20,018
Moochie.

854
01:08:32,305 --> 01:08:34,170
No hope.

855
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:37,403
I guess I'll have to give him
the shock treatment.

856
01:08:37,477 --> 01:08:39,911
Poor Pop.

857
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:42,345
Uh, where's the gun?

858
01:08:42,415 --> 01:08:46,010
In the hall closet.
I got the key.

859
01:08:46,085 --> 01:08:47,916
Well, here goes.

860
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,329
Pop?

861
01:09:08,408 --> 01:09:12,037
- Yes, Wilby.
- I've got something to tell you.

862
01:09:13,112 --> 01:09:14,409
But I'm afraid.

863
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:17,677
You never have to be afraid
to talk to me, Wilby.

864
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:20,651
Maybe sometimes
I'm a little impatient with you,

865
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,847
but that's because you're my son.

866
01:09:22,922 --> 01:09:26,358
- I want you to be something special.
- Yes, sir.

867
01:09:26,426 --> 01:09:28,519
You just tell me what's troubling you.

868
01:09:28,594 --> 01:09:31,427
I'm sure it can't be
anything too serious.

869
01:09:31,497 --> 01:09:34,898
Whatever it is, I promise you,
I'll understand.

870
01:09:34,967 --> 01:09:37,936
- Really, Pop?
- You can bank on it, Wilby.

871
01:09:38,004 --> 01:09:39,369
Shake on it?

872
01:09:39,505 --> 01:09:41,564
Certainly I'll shake on it, Wilby.

873
01:09:46,345 --> 01:09:49,439
- No!
- Oh, that did it.

874
01:09:56,155 --> 01:09:58,316
- [Wilson] Freeda!
- Wilson?

875
01:09:58,391 --> 01:10:01,155
- Freeda.
- Wilson, is that you?

876
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:09,959
What are we gonna do now?

877
01:10:10,036 --> 01:10:12,937
- We've got to get help.
- Look!

878
01:10:13,506 --> 01:10:15,133
[Wilby] The police.

879
01:10:19,378 --> 01:10:21,778
I'd like to report
some spies, please.

880
01:10:23,316 --> 01:10:24,840
All right, what's the name?

881
01:10:24,917 --> 01:10:27,545
Montgomery Daniels.

882
01:10:28,588 --> 01:10:29,714
Daniels?

883
01:10:29,789 --> 01:10:33,657
Any relation to that kid who tipped us
off about that gangster last week?

884
01:10:33,726 --> 01:10:36,923
Yes, sir. Wilby's my brother.

885
01:10:36,996 --> 01:10:40,523
But he didn't know it was
the new dean at the divinity college.

886
01:10:42,068 --> 01:10:45,595
Remember, Kelly, last week
when I used to be a sergeant?

887
01:10:45,671 --> 01:10:49,368
No kidding, officer. We need help!

888
01:10:51,577 --> 01:10:52,805
Who are you?

889
01:10:52,879 --> 01:10:55,211
Wilby Daniels.

890
01:10:55,281 --> 01:10:57,146
Wilby Daniels.

891
01:10:57,216 --> 01:10:59,013
I knew it.

892
01:10:59,919 --> 01:11:03,184
I knew it, first time
that dog spoke to me.

893
01:11:03,256 --> 01:11:06,555
- I said to my wife...
- Easy, now. It's all right.

894
01:11:06,626 --> 01:11:09,789
Probably some kid dressed up
in a dog suit or something.

895
01:11:09,862 --> 01:11:11,489
That's right, officer.

896
01:11:11,564 --> 01:11:15,364
Sure! That's how he spied on the spies.

897
01:11:15,434 --> 01:11:17,902
All right.

898
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:20,564
Take off the dog suit.

899
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,406
I can't, I don't have
anything on underneath.

900
01:11:24,477 --> 01:11:27,105
You see, Kelly, he can't.

901
01:11:27,179 --> 01:11:30,307
- You ought to know that.
- That's enough, you two.

902
01:11:30,383 --> 01:11:34,114
Stop bothering Officer Hansen
before we take you down to the station.

903
01:11:34,186 --> 01:11:37,212
- Fine, let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

904
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:40,555
No, you don't. Not in this car.

905
01:11:40,626 --> 01:11:42,093
But the spies!

906
01:11:42,161 --> 01:11:44,220
I'm afraid they're gonna have to keep.

907
01:11:44,297 --> 01:11:48,199
You see, there's a landing of invaders
from Mars over by the stockyards.

908
01:11:48,267 --> 01:11:50,667
I'm afraid we're going
to get over there.

909
01:11:54,774 --> 01:11:56,799
[Bell tolls]

910
01:12:01,047 --> 01:12:03,379
Gosh, Wilby. 2:00.

911
01:12:03,449 --> 01:12:05,815
We gotta think of something.

912
01:12:05,885 --> 01:12:07,409
Yeah.

913
01:12:07,787 --> 01:12:09,277
I got it!

914
01:12:11,123 --> 01:12:14,217
Here you are, you miserable beast.

915
01:12:14,293 --> 01:12:16,761
You can't take him. He's my...

916
01:12:18,564 --> 01:12:19,758
Your what?

917
01:12:19,832 --> 01:12:21,993
My pal.

918
01:12:23,769 --> 01:12:27,227
This is the last time you'll ever
get away, I can promise you that!

919
01:12:27,907 --> 01:12:29,704
Come on, you devil.

920
01:12:29,775 --> 01:12:32,471
Come along before I...
Come on.

921
01:12:35,615 --> 01:12:38,209
- No.
- Wilson, Wilson?

922
01:12:38,284 --> 01:12:41,219
Don't you dare move.
I'll get the spirits of ammonia.

923
01:12:43,489 --> 01:12:46,515
Pop! Pop! Snap out of it.
We've got to get moving.

924
01:12:46,592 --> 01:12:49,083
Oh, Moochie. Moochie...

925
01:12:49,161 --> 01:12:50,685
Is it true about Wilby?

926
01:12:50,763 --> 01:12:52,754
Did I see and hear
what I thought I saw?

927
01:12:52,832 --> 01:12:55,198
You sure did, Wilby's a dog now.

928
01:12:55,267 --> 01:12:56,325
No.

929
01:12:56,402 --> 01:12:58,734
My own boy. My own flesh and blood.

930
01:12:58,804 --> 01:13:01,830
Somehow, some way,
I failed him as a father.

931
01:13:01,907 --> 01:13:02,896
How did it happen?

932
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:06,069
- I'll tell you later. Hurry.
- Are we going somewhere?

933
01:13:07,013 --> 01:13:09,811
Don't you understand?
We gotta get help.

934
01:13:09,882 --> 01:13:13,181
- We gotta stop those spies.
- What spies?

935
01:13:13,252 --> 01:13:15,516
Remember? I told you about 'em.

936
01:13:15,588 --> 01:13:17,681
Spies! That's right, you did.

937
01:13:17,757 --> 01:13:20,885
Don't worry about a thing.
I'm in this with you all the way.

938
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,691
- Come on, we'll have to get some help.
- Not that way! This way.

939
01:13:26,565 --> 01:13:27,554
Wilson Daniels.

940
01:13:27,633 --> 01:13:30,397
You close that door.
You're not leaving this house.

941
01:13:30,469 --> 01:13:33,632
Stay out of this.
This is a job that calls for cool heads.

942
01:13:33,706 --> 01:13:35,105
Here, this way.

943
01:13:36,609 --> 01:13:38,440
Calm down, Mr. Daniels.

944
01:13:38,511 --> 01:13:41,105
I just want to get this thing straight.

945
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:42,943
Oh.

946
01:13:43,416 --> 01:13:47,216
Now, you say that
this information came from your son.

947
01:13:47,286 --> 01:13:50,653
Yes, my older son. He was right there
and he heard them talking.

948
01:13:50,723 --> 01:13:52,554
And they knew he was there?

949
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:54,820
I'm sure they knew he was there, but...

950
01:13:54,894 --> 01:13:57,328
Doesn't that strike you as rather odd?

951
01:13:57,396 --> 01:14:01,093
They'd speak of confidential matters
in front of your son?

952
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:04,830
It's not odd at all, they probably
didn't pay any attention to him.

953
01:14:04,904 --> 01:14:07,099
You see, my son happens to be a dog.

954
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:12,141
Your son is a dog?

955
01:14:12,211 --> 01:14:15,180
Yes. Don't get me wrong,
he's not a dog all the time.

956
01:14:15,247 --> 01:14:17,215
Just part of the time.

957
01:14:17,283 --> 01:14:19,217
I see.

958
01:14:22,655 --> 01:14:25,123
Well, uh, thank you for coming,
Mr. Daniels.

959
01:14:25,191 --> 01:14:27,557
- We'll look into it.
- You don't believe me.

960
01:14:27,626 --> 01:14:29,651
- Ow!
- I'm sorry.

961
01:14:29,729 --> 01:14:31,526
I don't have my shoes on.

962
01:14:31,597 --> 01:14:34,293
- Don't you believe me?
- Of course!

963
01:14:34,366 --> 01:14:36,266
Aren't you gonna do something?

964
01:14:36,335 --> 01:14:39,099
Well, we must proceed with caution,
Mr. Daniels.

965
01:14:39,171 --> 01:14:41,696
Dr. Andrassy is a well-respected man.

966
01:14:41,774 --> 01:14:44,265
But you haven't got time for caution.

967
01:14:44,343 --> 01:14:48,211
This thing that they stole is being
shipped out of the country tonight.

968
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:52,546
I don't suppose you have any idea
precisely what this thing may be.

969
01:14:52,618 --> 01:14:56,110
No, I don't. All I know is that
it's something called Section 32.

970
01:14:56,188 --> 01:14:58,281
- Something like that.
- Section 32?

971
01:14:58,357 --> 01:15:00,257
- That's right.
- Are you sure?

972
01:15:00,326 --> 01:15:02,988
That's what the dog said... my son.

973
01:15:03,863 --> 01:15:06,593
- Please sit down again.
- Well, I should think so.

974
01:15:09,101 --> 01:15:13,629
Now you still insist
a dog told you about this?

975
01:15:13,706 --> 01:15:16,504
Yes, why don't you ask
my younger son, Moochie?

976
01:15:16,575 --> 01:15:17,974
He's the dog's brother.

977
01:15:18,043 --> 01:15:23,003
- Just now, it's you I'm interested in.
- Me?

978
01:15:23,082 --> 01:15:25,573
You don't think
I had anything to do with this?

979
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:29,849
I came here in good faith. I told you
a simple, straightforward story.

980
01:15:29,922 --> 01:15:32,049
Just because my son
happens to be a dog,

981
01:15:32,124 --> 01:15:34,524
you look at me as though...

982
01:15:34,593 --> 01:15:39,394
As though I had wheels in my head.
Remember, I'm a government man myself.

983
01:15:39,465 --> 01:15:41,296
We have the utmost respect

984
01:15:41,367 --> 01:15:44,803
for the members of the United States
Post Office Department.

985
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:48,931
I wonder if you'd mind repeating
your story to one of my colleagues.

986
01:15:49,008 --> 01:15:52,341
I'd be glad to. All I ask is that
you gentlemen keep an open mind.

987
01:15:52,411 --> 01:15:54,971
- You see, my side...
- Not them.

988
01:15:55,047 --> 01:15:58,210
Would you step into the hall
with these gentlemen, please?

989
01:15:58,284 --> 01:16:00,479
Well... yes.

990
01:16:00,553 --> 01:16:02,077
Excuse me.

991
01:16:02,955 --> 01:16:06,220
It's fantastic,
but he knows about Section 32.

992
01:16:06,292 --> 01:16:09,261
- How could he?
- That's what I've got to find out.

993
01:16:09,328 --> 01:16:13,958
Meantime, check every man, sketch and
piece of equipment in that department.

994
01:16:14,033 --> 01:16:16,797
- That'll take time.
- Get moving.

995
01:16:18,971 --> 01:16:21,565
All right, Mr. Daniels,
this way, please.

996
01:16:23,742 --> 01:16:26,802
- I think you'll like Dr. Galvin.
- Doctor?

997
01:16:27,179 --> 01:16:30,637
Oh, uh, it's a kind of honorary title.

998
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:32,684
Now, just a minute.

999
01:16:40,559 --> 01:16:43,892
I've just returned from the museum.
I have our plan worked out.

1000
01:16:44,697 --> 01:16:46,858
Come upstairs, I'll go over it with you.

1001
01:16:46,932 --> 01:16:48,263
Yes, sir.

1002
01:16:48,334 --> 01:16:51,167
- Is my daughter at home?
- No, sir. Not yet.

1003
01:16:51,237 --> 01:16:53,603
- She went shopping.
- Good.

1004
01:17:06,018 --> 01:17:09,613
The girl must know absolutely nothing
of what's happening here.

1005
01:17:09,688 --> 01:17:11,053
I understand, sir.

1006
01:17:11,123 --> 01:17:15,321
As it is with matters coming to a head,
I don't quite know what to do about her.

1007
01:17:15,394 --> 01:17:20,331
It is unfortunate she is your daughter.
Otherwise the solution would be obvious.

1008
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:23,232
In any case, Stefano,
the problem is mine.

1009
01:17:23,302 --> 01:17:26,203
I'll decide what to do
when the time comes.

1010
01:17:28,574 --> 01:17:32,476
This is a sketch of the packing case
containing the small fossils.

1011
01:17:32,544 --> 01:17:34,409
Understand me clearly.

1012
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:37,415
From here on,
the slightest hitch will be disastrous.

1013
01:17:37,483 --> 01:17:38,882
You can depend on me.

1014
01:17:38,951 --> 01:17:43,581
When Thurm arrives with Section 32,
take them to my office at the museum.

1015
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:49,120
There you will find the packing case
containing the Etruscan fossils.

1016
01:17:49,194 --> 01:17:51,321
Suppose the authorities open the case?

1017
01:17:53,132 --> 01:17:54,394
They may.

1018
01:17:54,466 --> 01:17:59,529
But I doubt they will tamper
with a fragile, priceless collection

1019
01:17:59,605 --> 01:18:02,335
dispatched to such a distinguished man.

1020
01:18:02,408 --> 01:18:05,400
The packing case will be shipped
on the midnight plane,

1021
01:18:05,477 --> 01:18:08,105
consigned ostensibly
to the museum in Rome.

1022
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,808
You mean Anders himself
will pick up the shipment?

1023
01:18:10,883 --> 01:18:11,872
Silence!

1024
01:18:11,951 --> 01:18:14,579
You have instructions
never to mention his name.

1025
01:18:14,653 --> 01:18:16,314
[Stefano] What harm can it do?

1026
01:18:16,388 --> 01:18:19,016
Save for the dog
we are alone in the house.

1027
01:18:19,091 --> 01:18:23,926
Very well. Suppose we go over
what you must do, point by point.

1028
01:18:29,101 --> 01:18:31,729
- What are you doing here?
- Here?

1029
01:18:32,805 --> 01:18:34,272
Oh, here...

1030
01:18:35,908 --> 01:18:38,138
As a matter of fact,
I'm glad you asked me.

1031
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:41,373
I was wondering if you'd
give Francesca a message for me.

1032
01:18:41,447 --> 01:18:44,848
There's going to be a barbecue
at Dawson's Grove next Saturday.

1033
01:18:44,917 --> 01:18:47,215
I was thinking...

1034
01:18:47,286 --> 01:18:50,187
I know what you heard
and I know how to make you forget.

1035
01:18:50,255 --> 01:18:52,382
- Not now!
- What else can we do with him?

1036
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:55,859
I said, not now! Tie him up
and lock him in the dressing room.

1037
01:19:03,168 --> 01:19:06,604
[Doctor] You've gained access
to certain secret information.

1038
01:19:06,672 --> 01:19:09,106
Now, fearful of the consequences,

1039
01:19:09,174 --> 01:19:12,007
you transfer the burden of guilt
to your second self.

1040
01:19:12,077 --> 01:19:15,410
A submerged second identity,
known only to you.

1041
01:19:15,481 --> 01:19:18,416
What second identity?

1042
01:19:18,484 --> 01:19:20,611
This is very important, Mr. Daniels.

1043
01:19:20,686 --> 01:19:23,587
Do you often visualize yourself
as a dog?

1044
01:19:23,655 --> 01:19:27,386
- What?
- Let's be honest.

1045
01:19:28,894 --> 01:19:31,522
Do you often stand in front
of your shaving mirror

1046
01:19:31,597 --> 01:19:36,557
and instead of your own face, you see
a shiny, moist, black shoe-button nose?

1047
01:19:36,635 --> 01:19:38,933
A strong intelligent head?

1048
01:19:40,472 --> 01:19:42,702
- No!
- Excuse me, sir.

1049
01:19:42,775 --> 01:19:46,302
It's getting awfully late
and Mom'll be worried about us.

1050
01:19:46,378 --> 01:19:49,108
I don't see any reason
why you can't go.

1051
01:19:49,181 --> 01:19:52,810
- Good, I've had enough of this.
- I was referring to the boy.

1052
01:19:52,885 --> 01:19:56,548
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you
to remain a while longer, Mr. Daniels.

1053
01:19:56,622 --> 01:20:00,149
- Just a few more questions.
- Why don't you ask him a few questions?

1054
01:20:00,225 --> 01:20:03,820
He knows more about this than I do.
He'll say I'm telling the truth.

1055
01:20:03,896 --> 01:20:06,057
Perhaps we should question the boy.

1056
01:20:06,131 --> 01:20:09,589
There may be a hereditary factor
present between father and son.

1057
01:20:09,668 --> 01:20:12,603
Can't it wait, sir? I ought to be going.

1058
01:20:12,738 --> 01:20:17,038
Yes, they say heredity sometimes
plays a role in lycanthropy.

1059
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:19,637
Who are you calling a liar?

1060
01:20:19,711 --> 01:20:23,010
Lycanthropy is the alleged practice

1061
01:20:23,082 --> 01:20:25,676
of turning humans
into witches and werewolves.

1062
01:20:25,751 --> 01:20:28,549
Don't be ridiculous.
My son isn't any werewolf.

1063
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:32,021
He's just a big, baggy stupid-looking
shaggy dog.

1064
01:20:32,091 --> 01:20:34,582
Pop, I'm worried about Wilby.

1065
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:38,187
- He may be in trouble.
- What do you think I'm in?

1066
01:20:38,263 --> 01:20:41,061
Now, just a few questions, my lad.

1067
01:20:41,133 --> 01:20:45,695
It won't be any good, sir.
I don't know anything about all this.

1068
01:20:46,171 --> 01:20:47,502
Moochie!

1069
01:20:47,573 --> 01:20:49,438
What did you say?

1070
01:20:49,508 --> 01:20:53,035
I said I don't know anything,
and I'd like to go home, please.

1071
01:20:53,112 --> 01:20:54,875
Moochie!

1072
01:20:54,947 --> 01:20:58,713
Then, you don't believe
your brother is a dog?

1073
01:20:58,784 --> 01:21:00,877
Gosh, sir, would you?

1074
01:21:02,354 --> 01:21:03,878
Moochie!

1075
01:21:03,956 --> 01:21:08,689
Your father made up this entire story
about the dog, it was his idea?

1076
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:11,388
Pop's a great storyteller.

1077
01:21:11,463 --> 01:21:14,364
Kids come from all around
just to hear him.

1078
01:21:14,967 --> 01:21:16,594
Moochie!

1079
01:21:18,604 --> 01:21:21,539
Sorry, Pop. I had to do it.

1080
01:21:23,108 --> 01:21:25,099
Betts, I'm letting the boy go.

1081
01:21:25,177 --> 01:21:27,805
Please see that he gets home
in a company car.

1082
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,474
- Yes, sir.
- All right, son.

1083
01:21:34,553 --> 01:21:35,542
Moochie.

1084
01:21:35,621 --> 01:21:39,751
You go back to my office and Mr. Betts
will take care of you. Go ahead.

1085
01:21:41,994 --> 01:21:43,552
Moochie.

1086
01:21:43,629 --> 01:21:45,494
- May I, Doctor?
- Of course.

1087
01:21:45,564 --> 01:21:50,058
Now, Mr. Daniels, we've had
our little joke about the dog,

1088
01:21:50,135 --> 01:21:52,228
suppose we get down to cases.

1089
01:21:52,304 --> 01:21:55,398
I want to know just how,
when and where

1090
01:21:55,474 --> 01:21:58,238
you found out about Section 32.

1091
01:22:07,252 --> 01:22:09,345
[Bell tolls]

1092
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:14,085
- Did you get it?
- Yes, I have it.

1093
01:22:18,764 --> 01:22:20,561
- Section 32, complete.
- Good.

1094
01:22:21,233 --> 01:22:23,030
[Thurm] We're in trouble.

1095
01:22:23,101 --> 01:22:26,195
- Something's gone wrong at the plant.
- What do you mean?

1096
01:22:26,271 --> 01:22:28,239
An investigation, my name came up.

1097
01:22:28,307 --> 01:22:32,300
- I had to answer ticklish questions.
- You knew the right answers, I trust?

1098
01:22:32,377 --> 01:22:34,504
Of course,
but I didn't the sound of 'em.

1099
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:36,912
I'm not sure
that I wasn't followed here.

1100
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,210
We'll have to use the emergency plan.

1101
01:22:40,285 --> 01:22:42,879
The other is too risky now.
What about the boat?

1102
01:22:42,955 --> 01:22:45,287
It's tied up at Walker's Dock,
ready to go.

1103
01:22:45,357 --> 01:22:47,416
Bring the sedan around.

1104
01:22:47,492 --> 01:22:49,119
What about the boy?

1105
01:22:50,162 --> 01:22:52,790
We'll be out of the country
before they find him.

1106
01:23:02,274 --> 01:23:04,970
[Andrassy] I don't understand
what went wrong.

1107
01:23:05,043 --> 01:23:06,635
You're sure that...

1108
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,074
Yes? What do you want?

1109
01:23:10,148 --> 01:23:13,015
I wanted to say
I'm going out with Buzz Miller.

1110
01:23:13,085 --> 01:23:15,952
I'm sorry, but I've been called away
for a few days

1111
01:23:16,021 --> 01:23:18,046
and I would like you to come with me.

1112
01:23:18,123 --> 01:23:20,614
Isn't this rather short notice?

1113
01:23:22,828 --> 01:23:24,056
Where are we going?

1114
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:26,359
I have no time for questions.
Get ready.

1115
01:23:28,734 --> 01:23:31,032
If you don't mind,
I'd prefer to stay here.

1116
01:23:31,103 --> 01:23:32,866
You'll do as I say!

1117
01:23:36,608 --> 01:23:38,371
What is this?

1118
01:23:38,443 --> 01:23:40,001
Francesca...

1119
01:23:40,078 --> 01:23:42,171
you're an intelligent girl.

1120
01:23:42,247 --> 01:23:45,045
I don't believe
I have to make any needless threats.

1121
01:23:46,118 --> 01:23:49,087
Take her to her room.
See that she takes what she needs.

1122
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:50,553
Hurry.

1123
01:24:04,636 --> 01:24:07,434
- Here you are, son.
- Thank you very much, sir.

1124
01:24:41,173 --> 01:24:44,734
We don't want to attract attention.
Drive at a normal speed.

1125
01:25:06,298 --> 01:25:09,358
Wilby. Here, Wilby!

1126
01:25:09,434 --> 01:25:11,629
[Whistles] Wilby!

1127
01:25:23,115 --> 01:25:25,379
Wilby.
Here, Wilby.

1128
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:26,474

Here, Wilby.

1131
01:25:33,225 --> 01:25:34,590
Here, Wilby.

1132
01:25:35,327 --> 01:25:36,555
Here, Wilby.

01:25:59,684 --> 01:26:01,413
Wilby, what's going on?

1137
01:26:01,486 --> 01:26:04,153
Come on, they're getting away.

1138
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:09,089
They're heading for Walker's Dock.

1139
01:26:10,996 --> 01:26:12,395
Hey, look out!

1140
01:26:17,436 --> 01:26:20,098
Some day I'm gonna murder that dog.

1141
01:26:23,675 --> 01:26:26,303
Hey, you mangy cur,
come back with my car.

1142
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,858
Wait, stop!

1143
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:55,228
Officer!

1144
01:26:55,307 --> 01:26:58,401
Officer, get him!
Get him.

1145
01:26:58,477 --> 01:27:01,071
That shaggy dog just stole my car.

1146
01:27:01,146 --> 01:27:03,444
Shaggy dog?

1147
01:27:03,515 --> 01:27:06,075
It's no use, Kelly.

1148
01:27:06,718 --> 01:27:09,516
I've just gotta face it.
I gotta face it.

1149
01:27:10,655 --> 01:27:11,986
Follow that dog!

1150
01:27:18,263 --> 01:27:19,753
Hey, wait!

1151
01:27:21,299 --> 01:27:25,565
- Wait for us!
- Never mind, Buzz, here comes my pop.

1152
01:27:33,712 --> 01:27:35,577
Pop! Pop!

1153
01:27:35,647 --> 01:27:39,014
- Follow that police car.
- Don't you ever speak to me again.

1154
01:27:39,084 --> 01:27:41,052
Come on, you can't let him get away.

1155
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:43,110
You don't know what you're asking me.

1156
01:27:43,188 --> 01:27:46,157
You know what I've gone through
for the last two hours?

1157
01:27:46,224 --> 01:27:48,215
- It's my car.
- I'm not a well man.

1158

Really? May I ask who was in it?

Would you have them
send my car around, please?

1218
01:32:40,618 --> 01:32:43,451
That is, unless it's been stolen
by a purple kangaroo

1219

All right, Mercer, very cute.

1225
01:33:27,332 --> 01:33:29,596
- Come on.
- Sorry, we're to bring you in.

1226

In? I can't go back without that dog.

1227
01:33:32,303 --> 01:33:35,101
Sorry, I got the word
from Scanlon, loud and clear.

I loaned you my dress uniform
for the Shriner's convention.

1232
01:33:46,584 --> 01:33:50,020
Ed, don't these things
mean anything to you?

1233
01:33:51,823 --> 01:33:54,257
All right, I'll take a chance, Hansen.

1234
01:33:54,325 --> 01:33:56,919

you know what you're doing.

Have them stop that boat!

Ow!

1247
01:35:36,527 --> 01:35:38,188
- What's the matter?
- Go ahead.

1248
01:35:38,262 --> 01:35:41,663
I'm all right.
I've just broken my foot.

1249
01:35:48,873 --> 01:35:50,033
Did they get away?

1250
01:35:50,108 --> 01:35:52,201
Did they get away?

1251
01:35:52,276 --> 01:35:53,641

There, there, now.
Everything's under control.

1256
01:36:37,822 --> 01:36:40,655
How in the world did you get here?

1257
01:36:40,725 --> 01:36:44,161
The last thing I remember, Chiffon...

1258
01:36:44,228 --> 01:36:49,188
Don't worry your pretty little head.
OI' Buzz got here in the nick of time.

1259
01:36:49,267 --> 01:36:52,259
- But, Buzz...
- Don't thank me. It's nothing.

1260
01:36:52,336 --> 01:36:53,826
Nothing at all.

What's the matter with you?
Let go of me.

1264
01:37:05,850 --> 01:37:09,251
Wait a minute!
I didn't do anything.

1265
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:11,311
Look out, will you?

1266
01:37:11,456 --> 01:37:13,686
Chiffon! Let go, you silly mutt!

1267
01:37:13,758 --> 01:37:15,419
Mutt. Ouch.

1268
01:37:15,493 --> 01:37:17,461
Stop it. Cut it out.

1269
01:37:22,467 --> 01:37:24,867
That's the man, Captain.
That's him.

1270
01:37:26,104 --> 01:37:27,901
No, no. I'm innocent.

1271

No, no.

1272
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:30,873
I'm innocent.

1273

Look, I'll...
I haven't done anything wrong.

1274
01:37:33,778 --> 01:37:37,236
I'll explain the whole thing again.
You see, my boy is a dog...

- Wilby!
- Good ol' Buzz?

The great big hero, eh?

[Wilby] Don't know what I'm
talking about. I bet you don't!

Over here with that.
You're in the way. You mind?

1287
01:38:40,044 --> 01:38:42,911
- No, not at all.
- Thank you. Now let's...

Thank you very much. Now...

this whole thrilling thing possible.

01:39:05,269 --> 01:39:07,669
Now, just a minute!

1298
01:39:07,738 --> 01:39:11,834
I will not have that dog
on my good chair with his dusty feet.

1299
01:39:11,909 --> 01:39:13,774
Oh, don't worry about it, honey.

1300
01:39:13,844 --> 01:39:15,505
A dog can't hurt anything.

1301
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:18,014
How 'bout me with my arm around him
like this?

1302
01:39:18,082 --> 01:39:20,209
Fine.

1303

Why not?

1306
01:39:30,294 --> 01:39:33,058
Come here, son.
Not you, the little fella.

1307
01:39:36,667 --> 01:39:39,500
Come on, Wilby, let's talk a walk.

1308

You stay just like that. Good.
Mr. Daniels, you be looking at your son.

That's fine.

1310
01:39:46,377 --> 01:39:50,143
Anyway, sure was nice of Francesca
to give us the dog.

1311
01:39:50,915 --> 01:39:55,545
That old house is sure gonna seem empty
with her gone back to Paris.

1312
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:57,554
Yeah. Swell girl.

1313
01:39:57,622 --> 01:40:00,250
Oh well, I guess it's all for the best.

1314

I was getting tired of all that
French lingo anyway.

Wanna know something else? I don't think
we've been fair to Allison.

She's a swell girl, too.

1317
01:40:09,367 --> 01:40:12,268
Yeah. Good sport, real good sport.

No, no, no, Mr. Daniels.
The medal is for the dog.

Oh.

1329

- There.
- That's good!

1330
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:12,286
Well, I finally got a dog.
