1
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,451
All aboard!

2
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,461
Let him go, Orville.

3
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,258
We made it plain we don't want
no more traveling salesmen in Brighton.

4
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,762
Credit is no good for a notions salesman.

5
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,681
How far you going, friend?

6
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,767
Wherever the people
are as green as the money...

7
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,269
...friend.

8
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,272
- What's the matter with credit?
- It's old-fashioned.

9
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,192
You're an anvil salesman.
Your firm give credit?

10
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,279
- No, sir!
- Nor anybody else!

11
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,949
River City next station stop.
River City, lowa!

12
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,330
Cash for the merchandise

13
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,957
Cash for the buttonhooks

14
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:32,003
Cash for the cotton goods
Cash for the hard goods

15
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:36,090
Cash for the fancy goods
Cash for the soft goods

16
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,302
Cash for the noggins and the piggins
And the firkins

17
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,013
Cash for the hogshead
Cask and demijohn

18
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,432
Cash for the crackers
And the pickles and the flypaper

19
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,268
Look, whaddya talk?
Whaddya talk, whaddya talk?

20
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,478
Where you get it?

21
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,521
You can talk, you can talk
You can bicker, you can talk

22
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,774
You can bicker, bicker, bicker
You can talk, you can talk

23
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,776
You can talk, talk, talk, talk
Bicker, bicker, bicker

24
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,819
You can talk all you want to
But it's different than it was

25
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,822
No it ain't, no it ain't
But you got to know the territory

26
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,868
It's the Model T Ford made the trouble
Made the people want to go

27
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,745
Want to git, want to git
Want to git up and go

28
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,248
1, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 22

29
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,999
23 miles to the county seat

30
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,167
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

31
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,504
Who's gonna patronize a little bitty
2 by 4 kind of store anymore?

32
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,173
- Whaddya talk? Whaddya talk?
- Gone, gone

33
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,175
Gone with the hogshead cask
And demijohn

34
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,302
Gone with the sugar barrel
Pickle barrel, milk pan

35
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,596
Gone with the tub
And the pail and the tierce

36
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,682
Ever meet a fellow
By the name of Hill?

37
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,308
Hill?

38
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,477
Hill?

39
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,687
- Hill!
No!

40
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,355
Just a minute
Just a minute, just a minute

41
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,982
Never heard of any salesman Hill

42
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,359
- He doesn't know the territory
- Doesn't know the territory?

43
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,362
- What's the fella's line?
- Never worries about his line

44
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,030
Or a doggone thing

45
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,741
He's just a bang-beat, bell-ringing
Big haul, great go-neck-or-nothing

46
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,868
Rip-roaring
Every-time-a-bull's-eye salesman

47
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,620
That's Professor Harold Hill
Harold Hill

48
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,871
What's the fella's line?
What's his line?

49
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,832
He's a fake
And he doesn't know the territory

50
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,126
Look, whaddya talk, whaddya talk?
Whaddya talk, whaddya talk?

51
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,585
He's a music man

52
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,212
- He's a what?
- He's a music man

53
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,214
And he sells clarinets
To the kids in the town

54
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,717
With the big trombones
And the rat-a-tat drums

55
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,552
Big brass bass
Big brass bass

56
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,637
And the piccolo, the piccolo
With uniforms too

57
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,724
With a shiny gold braid on the coat
And a big red stripe running

58
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,517
Well, I don't know much about bands

59
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,353
But I do know you can't make a living
Selling big trombones

60
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,563
No, sir!

61
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,149
Mandolin picks, perhaps
And here and there a jew's-harp

62
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,860
No, the fella sells bands
Boys' bands

63
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,154
I don't know how he does it
But he lives like a king

64
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,448
And he dallies and he gathers
And he plucks and he shines

65
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,575
And when the man dances
Certainly, boys

66
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,577
What else?
The piper pays him

67
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,953
Yes, sir!

68
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,246
Yes, sir!

69
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,248
Yes, sir!

70
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,083
Yes, sir!

71
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,253
When the man dances
Certainly, boys

72
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,506
What else?
The piper pays him

73
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,925
Yes, sir!

74
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,178
Yes, sir!

75
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,764
But he doesn't know the territory!

76
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,894
River City!

77
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,063
Station stop, River City.

78
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,523
Just crossed the state line into lowa.

79
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,485
Population River City: 2212.

80
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,280
Cigarettes illegal in this state.

81
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,785
If you're all through
I'll tell you about this Harold Hill.

82
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,745
Say, you know Hill?

83
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:15,124
Never saw him in my life. But I just
been run out of town because of Hill.

84
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,211
He's giving every one of us a black eye.

85
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,463
You go into town to call on the trade...

86
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,466
...and they're waiting for you
with tar and feathers...

87
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,885
...to ride you out the city limits on a rail!

88
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,804
How you account for that?

89
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,809
It's this Hill! He goes around
selling band instruments and uniforms...

90
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:37,313
...and instruction books by guaranteeing
to teach the kids to play.

91
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,775
- Stands to reason.
- And organize them kids into a band...

92
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,485
...with himself as the leader.

93
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,861
What's wrong with that?

94
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,322
He don't know one note...

95
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,324
...from another!
- Heh-heh.

96
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,617
That's what's wrong!

97
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,204
He don't know a bass drum
from a pipe organ.

98
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,166
He's a bare-faced, double-shuffle,
two-bit thimblerigger!

99
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,836
And I'll catch up with him
one of these days.

100
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,171
When I do I'll have
the law on him quick!

101
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,716
Territory's tough enough
without him fouling up the nest.

102
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,177
I'd like to be around
when you catch up with him.

103
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:12,849
I'm not apt to catch up with him in lowa.
Not on your kidney plaster!

104
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,852
He's too smart to pull
that flimflam out here.

105
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,729
Not on these neck-bowed Hawkeyes.

106
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:24,485
Gentlemen, you intrigue me.
I think I'll have to give lowa a try.

107
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,530
- I didn't catch your name.
- I didn't drop it.

108
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,843
Sir-?

109
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:02,940
Fine-looking animal.

110
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,151
For a horse, yeah.

111
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,581
Good morning. Could you kindly
direct me to the center of town?

112
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,627
Runs right down the middle
of the street.

113
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,278
Friend, where would I find a good hotel?

114
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,365
Try the Palmer House in Chicago.

115
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,381
I'm a stranger in town.
What do you folks do for excitement?

116
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,800
Mind our business.

117
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,136
You are in lo-way

118
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,389
At least now I know how
to pronounce it.

119
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,140
I thought you preferred lo-wuh.

120
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,350
We do.

121
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,935
But he just said lo-way.

122
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,772
We say it now and then.
But we don't like anybody else to.

123
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,983
We are from lo-way

124
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,150
I know.

125
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:33,531
Well, you folks certainly do know how
to make a body feel at home.

126
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,700
Oh, there's nothing halfway

127
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,744
About the lowa way to treat you
When we treat you

128
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,163
Which we may not do at all

129
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,751
There's an lowa kind of special
Chip-on-the-shoulder attitude

130
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,338
- We've never been without
- That we recall

131
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:53,092
We can be cold as
The falling thermometer in December

132
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,053
If you ask about our weather in July

133
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:01,017
And we're so by-God stubborn
We can stand touching noses

134
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,353
For a week at a time
And never see eye to eye

135
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,023
But what the heck
You're welcome

136
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,941
Join us at the picnic

137
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,278
- You can eat your fill
- Of all the food you bring yourself

138
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:15,197
You really ought to give lowa a try

139
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,200
Provided you were contrary

140
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,785
Good morning, Mayor Shinn.

141
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,704
Good morning, Mayor Shinn.

142
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:25,666
It is if you want to go around
in your drawers all day.

143
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,672
We can be cold as
A falling thermometer in December

144
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,884
If you ask about our weather in July

145
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:39,263
And we're so by-God stubborn
We can stand touching noses

146
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:44,644
For a week at a time
And never see eye to eye

147
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:50,733
But we'll give you our shirt

148
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:56,072
And the back to go with it

149
00:10:56,238 --> 00:11:03,245
If your crop should happen to die

150
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,082
So what the heck
You're welcome

151
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,958
Glad to have you with us

152
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,420
Even though we may not
Ever mention it again

153
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,756
You really ought to give lowa

154
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,758
Hawkeye lowa

155
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,303
Dubuque, Des Moines, Davenport
Marshalltown, Mason City

156
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,972
Keokuk, Ames, Clear Lake

157
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:27,603
Ought to give lowa a try

158
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,959
Mr. Squires. Yes.

159
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,545
I'm interested in a rig for Sunday.

160
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:56,215
Then you ought to see the man
in charge of hiring rigs.

161
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,977
Rigs?

162
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,272
Riggs? Ain't nobody here by that name.

163
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,898
Marcellus!

164
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,235
Marcellus Washburn!

165
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,322
Gregory!

166
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,995
Of all the people to run into in lowa!
Gregory!

167
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,623
Shh. Hill's the name this trip.
Professor Harold Hill.

168
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,834
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

169
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,335
I didn't know I was, myself.

170
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:37,506
I never thought I'd find a slicker
like you here in the sarsaparilla belt.

171
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,508
This is where I work.

172
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,054
- You mean you live in this town?
- Yeah. I like it too.

173
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,892
It's not Brooklyn, New York.
Not the city of homes and churches but-

174
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,853
Brooklyn?
Marce, this isn't even Dubuque.

175
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,731
Hey. Are you hiding out or what?

176
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:58,569
Just not as light on my feet as I used
to be when I was shilling for you.

177
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,655
You're in a business that got
a lot of close shaves.

178
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,784
I got a nice job now.
I got a nice girl.

179
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,536
Ethel Toffelmier.
That's the boss's niece.

180
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,539
So you've gone legitimate, huh?

181
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,833
I knew you'd come to no good.

182
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,712
What are you selling now?
I heard you were in steam automobiles.

183
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,088
- I was.
- What happened?

184
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,050
- Somebody actually invented one.
- No!

185
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,219
So now I'm back at the old stand.

186
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,513
Not boys' bands?

187
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,349
They got no call for boys' bands
in this town.

188
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,310
Anything lowa folk don't have
they do without.

189
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,686
They got music?

190
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,231
They got a gramophone down
to the barber shop.

191
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,483
And a stuck-up librarian gives piano.

192
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,193
- Gives piano?
- A maiden lady.

193
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,904
She'll expose you
before you unpack this bag.

194
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:46,200
Maiden lady librarians who give piano
are a specialty of mine.

195
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,828
Just point her out
the minute you see her.

196
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,081
Yeah. I'll back her into a corner
and breathe on her glasses.

197
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,544
Thar she blows!

198
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,676
I'll do it but I won't like it.

199
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,764
That's not the librarian.
That's Mrs. Shinn, the mayor's wife.

200
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,403
Good afternoon, Mrs. Shinn.

201
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,030
Don't change the subject.

202
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,782
Something the matter?

203
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:31,245
The same thing is the matter as is
always the matter here. Look!

204
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:36,375
Is this the sort of book
you give my daughter?

205
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:41,130
This Ruby Hat of Omar Kay-ay-ay-
I am appalled!

206
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,299
I did recommend it.

207
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,301
It's beautiful Persian poetry.

208
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,845
It's dirty Persian poetry.

209
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,806
People lying out in the woods
eating sandwiches.

210
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,268
Getting drunk
with pitfall and with gin.

211
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,813
Drinking directly out of jugs
with innocent young girls.

212
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,815
- No daughter of mine-
- Mrs. Shinn.

213
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,318
The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam
is a classic.

214
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,158
It's a smutty book, like most of
the others you keep here, I daresay.

215
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,492
Honestly, Mrs. Shinn.

216
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:15,122
Wouldn't you rather have your daughter
read a classic than Elinor Glyn?

217
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:20,085
What Elinor Glyn reads
is her mother's problem.

218
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:24,924
Just you keep your dirty books
away from my daughter.

219
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,363
You sure picked yourself a town.

220
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,823
Let me take you over to the hotel.

221
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,700
Not sure I'm going to stay yet.

222
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,996
First I got to find a way to get into
some of these lowa boodlebags.

223
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,040
Greg, it ain't easy.

224
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,833
All I need is an opening.

225
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,462
You remember the pitch. What can I use?
What's new around here?

226
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:08,092
The other day a farmer brought in
an egg had 3 yolks in it.

227
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,010
Was in the paper.

228
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,389
That's exciting, all right.
No, what do you talk about?

229
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,891
There's the weather, of course.

230
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,726
When it's in season.

231
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,312
Now, Marce, I need some ideas...

232
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,941
...if I'm going to get your town
out of the serious trouble it's in.

233
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,901
River City ain't in any trouble.

234
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,653
We'll have to create some.

235
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,573
Must create a desperate need
in your town for a boys' band.

236
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,703
Why is everyone rubbering
into the billiard parlor?

237
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,039
They just got in a new pool table.

238
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,916
They must have seen one before.

239
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,669
No. Just billiards.

240
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,924
That'll do it!

241
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,968
Just sit where you are.
And remember...

242
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,262
...if you see that music teacher...

243
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,645
Are you Mr. Dunlop?

244
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,482
Either you're closing your eyes to a
situation you don't wish to acknowledge...

245
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,277
...or you are not aware
of the caliber of disaster...

246
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:12,281
...indicated by the presence of
a pool table in your community.

247
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,492
Well, you got trouble, my friend
Right here, I say

248
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,037
Trouble right here in River City
Why, sure, I'm a billiard player

249
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,873
Certainly mighty proud to say
I'm always proud to say it

250
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,793
I consider that the hours I spend
With a cue in my hand are golden

251
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,589
Help you cultivate horse sense
And a cool head and a keen eye

252
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,924
You ever take and try to give
An ironclad leave to yourself

253
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,843
From a three-rail billiard shot?

254
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,387
But just as I say
It takes judgment, brains and maturity

255
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,265
To score in a balk-line game
I say that any boob

256
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,935
Can take and shove a ball in a pocket
And I call that sloth

257
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,814
The first big step on the road
To the depths of degrada- I say first

258
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:49,151
Medicinal wine from a teaspoon
Then beer from a bottle

259
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,155
The next thing you know your son is
Playing for money in a pinch-back suit

260
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,407
And listening to some big
Out-o'- town jasper

261
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,534
Hearing him tell about
Horserace gambling

262
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,161
Not a wholesome trotting race, no

263
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,663
But a race where they set down
Right on the horse!

264
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,833
Like to see some stuck-up jockey boy
Setting on Dan Patch?

265
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,086
Make your blood boil?
Well, I should say!

266
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,962
Now, friends
Let me tell you what I mean

267
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,006
You got 1, 2, 3, 4

268
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,258
5, 6 pockets in a table

269
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,470
Pockets that mark the difference
Between a gentleman and a bum

270
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:20,182
With a capital B and that
Rhymes with P and that stands for pool

271
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,684
And all week long your River City
Youth'll be frittering away

272
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,770
I say your young men'll be frittering

273
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,357
Frittering away their noontime
Suppertime, chore time too

274
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,818
Get the ball in the pocket
Never mind getting dandelions pulled

275
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,487
Or the screen door patched
Or the beefsteak pounded

276
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,656
Never mind pumping any water
Till your parents are caught

277
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,408
With the cistern empty on a Saturday night
And that's trouble

278
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,244
Yes, you got lots and lots of trouble

279
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,830
I'm thinking of the kids in the
Knickerbockers, shirttail young ones

280
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,456
Peeking in the pool hall window
After school

281
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,459
You got trouble, folks
Right here in River City

282
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:51,088
Trouble with a capital T and that
Rhymes with P and that stands for pool

283
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,882
Now I know all you folks
Are the right kind of parents

284
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,551
I'm going to be perfectly frank

285
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,011
Would you like to know what kind of
Conversation goes on

286
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,555
While they're loafing around that hall?

287
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,932
They'll be trying out Bevo
Trying out Cubebs

288
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,601
Trying out Tail or Mades
Like cigarette fiends

289
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,894
And bragging all about

290
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,188
How they're going to cover up
A telltale breath with Sen-Sen

291
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,192
One fine night they leave the pool hall
Headin' for the dance at the Armory

292
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,987
Libertine men and scarlet women
And ragtime

293
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,738
Shameless music
That'll grab your son

294
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:21,118
Your daughter, with the arms of
A jungle animal instinct mass-teria

295
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,204
Friends, the idle brain
Is the devil's playground, trouble!

296
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,040
We got trouble
- Right here in River City

297
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,752
With a capital T and that rhymes with P
And that stands for pool

298
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,880
We've surely got trouble

299
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,715
Right here in River City

300
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,634
Got to figure out a way to keep
The young ones moral after school

301
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,888
Our children's children
Gonna have trouble

302
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:45,267
Mothers of River City,
heed that warning before it's too late.

303
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,145
Watch for the telltale signs
of corruption.

304
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,147
The minute your son leaves the house...

305
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,901
...does he rebuckle his knickerbockers
below the knee?

306
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,112
Is there a nicotine stain
on his index finger?

307
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,907
A dime novel hidden in the corn crib?

308
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:04,036
Is he starting to memorize jokes
from Captain Billy's Whiz Bang?

309
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,458
Are certain words
creeping into his conversation?

310
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,710
Words like...

311
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,128
Like "swell."

312
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,215
And "So's your old man."

313
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,967
If so, my friends...

314
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,302
You got trouble

315
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,137
Right here in River City

316
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,807
With a capital T and that rhymes with P
And that stands for pool

317
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,100
We surely got trouble

318
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,686
Right here in River City

319
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,564
Remember the Maine, Plymouth Rock
And the Golden Rule

320
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,650
Our children's children
Gonna have trouble

321
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,486
Oh-ho, we got trouble
We're in terrible, terrible trouble

322
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,656
That game with the 15 numbered balls
Is the devil's tool

323
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,242
Oh, yes, we got
Trouble, trouble, trouble

324
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,329
- With a T
- With a capital T

325
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,331
Got to rhyme it with P

326
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,792
And that stands for pool

327
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:56,213
Remember, my friends, listen to me
Because I pass this way but once!

328
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,760
- Did you drop your-?
- No.

329
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,725
- Didn't I meet you in-?
- No.

330
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,478
I'll only be in town a short while.

331
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,273
Good!

332
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,336
Hello, Mama.

333
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,797
Keep on, Amaryllis.
I'll be there in a minute.

334
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,070
That's fine, dear.
Now on with your exercises.

335
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,823
Library open later
than usual tonight, dear?

336
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,700
It always is, Mama.

337
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,037
Mama, a man with a suitcase
followed me home.

338
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,414
Oh? Who?

339
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,375
I never saw him before.

340
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,876
Did he say anything?

341
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,252
He tried.

342
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,296
Did you say anything?

343
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,965
Of course not, Mama.

344
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,387
Now don't dawdle, Amaryllis.

345
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,971
So, do

346
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,391
La, re, ti, me

347
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,644
A little slower
And please keep the fingers curved

348
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:19,231
As nice and high as you possibly can

349
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,982
Don't get faster, dear.

350
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,151
It wouldn't have hurt you...

351
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,446
...to have found out
what the gentleman wanted.

352
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,324
I know what the gentleman wanted.

353
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,826
What, dear?

354
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,829
You'll find it in Balzac.

355
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,832
Excuse me for living,
but I never read it.

356
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,626
Neither has anyone else in this town

357
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,712
There you go again
With the same old comment

358
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,507
About the low mentality
Of River City people

359
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,968
And taking it all too much to heart

360
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,553
Now, Mama, as long as the...

361
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,055
Madison Public Library
Was entrusted to me

362
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,891
For the purpose of improving
River City's cultural level

363
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,477
I can't help my concern that
The ladies of River City

364
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,646
Keep ignoring
All my counsel and advice

365
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,856
But, darling!

366
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:04,317
When a woman has a husband
And you've got none

367
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,320
Why should she take advice from you

368
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,073
Even if you can quote
Balzac and Shakespeare

369
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,868
And all them other
Highfalutin Greeks?

370
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:16,037
If you don't mind my saying so
You have a bad habit

371
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,289
Of changing every subject

372
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,333
No, I haven't changed the subject
I was talking about that stranger

373
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,085
- What stranger?
- With the suitcase

374
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,005
Who may be your very last chance

375
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,592
Do you think that I'd allow
A common masher? Now really, Mama!

376
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,303
I have my standards
Where men are concerned

377
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,762
And I have no intention-

378
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,183
I know all about your standards
And if you don't mind my saying so

379
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,935
There's not a man alive
Who could hope to measure up

380
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,938
To that blend of Paul Bunyan,
Saint Pat and Noah Webster

381
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,066
You've concocted for yourself
Out of your Irish imagination

382
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,819
Your lowa stubbornness
And your library full of books

383
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,615
Well, if that isn't
the best I ever heard!

384
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,116
Thank you.

385
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,160
Can I have a drink, please?

386
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,329
- May I-?
- May I have a drink, please?

387
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,039
Yes, you may.

388
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,979
Hello, Winthrop.

389
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,565
Winthrop, it's after dark, dear!

390
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:29,945
I'm having a party on Saturday.
Will you please come?

391
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:34,491
It's going to be a very nice party.
And I'd especially like it if you'd-

392
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:39,287
Amaryllis asked you to her party.
Are you going or aren't you?

393
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,748
- No.
- No, what?

394
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,166
No, thank you.

395
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,293
You know the little girl's name.

396
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,629
I'll bet he won't say it.

397
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,549
"No, thank you," who, Winthrop?

398
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,801
No, thank you, Amaryllith!

399
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,010
"Amaryllith"!

400
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,099
He's crying!

401
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,062
Hello, Winthrop.

402
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,524
Winthrop, you didn't even
say hello to your sister.

403
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,027
He hates to say Amaryllis
because of the lisp.

404
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,779
He's ashamed.

405
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,948
We know all about his lisp, Amaryllis.

406
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:18,910
Why should he get so mad at people?
Just because he lisps?

407
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,455
- That's just part of it.
- What's the rest of it?

408
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:26,501
Never mind, dear. It's just that
he never talks very much.

409
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,837
Not even to you and your mother?

410
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:33,216
No, but we have to be
very patient and understanding.

411
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,260
I'm patient.

412
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:39,097
I even say good night to him
on the evening star.

413
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,682
Every night.

414
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,687
Good night, my Winthrop.

415
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,480
Good night.

416
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,357
Sleep tight.

417
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,361
And he never says anything to me.

418
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,406
Oh, darling, don't cry.

419
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,535
You'll have lots of time
for sweethearts.

420
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,079
If not Winthrop,
there'll be someone else.

421
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:07,292
Never! I'll end up an old maid like you.

422
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,711
I'm sorry, Miss Marian.

423
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,547
Can I play my cross-hand piece?

424
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,091
- May I-?
- May I play my cross-hand piece?

425
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,885
Yes, you may.

426
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,346
If a girl doesn't have a sweetheart...

427
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:23,224
...who's she going to say good night to
on the evening star?

428
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,519
For the time being, you can just say:

429
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,188
"Good night...

430
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,397
...my someone."

431
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,901
You can put the name in
when the right someone comes along.

432
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:36,196
All right. It's better than nothing.

433
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,989
Yes, it is.

434
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,908
Now you can play your cross-hand piece.

435
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:10,814
Good night, my someone

436
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,693
Good night, my love

437
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,738
Sleep tight, my someone

438
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:23,159
Sleep tight, my love

439
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:27,497
Our star is shining

440
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,626
Its brightest light

441
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:36,172
For good night, my love

442
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:40,218
For good night

443
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:44,556
Sweet dreams be yours, dear

444
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:48,226
If dreams there be

445
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,978
Sweet dreams

446
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,021
To carry you

447
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,316
Close to me

448
00:28:56,067 --> 00:29:00,113
I wish they may

449
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,993
And I wish they might

450
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:10,206
Now good night, my someone

451
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:13,168
Good night

452
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,212
True love can be whispered

453
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,840
From heart to heart

454
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:23,887
When lovers are parted, they say

455
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,182
But I must depend

456
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:31,019
On a wish and a star

457
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:35,315
As long as my heart

458
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:40,361
Doesn't know who you are

459
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:45,408
Sweet dreams be yours, dear

460
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,870
If dreams there be

461
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,872
Sweet dreams

462
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,628
To carry you close to me

463
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:01,549
I wish they may

464
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:07,680
And I wish they might

465
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,603
Now good night, my someone

466
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,731
Good night

467
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:23,822
Good night

468
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:32,372
Good night

469
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:43,258
O Columbia
The gem of the ocean

470
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:48,096
The home of the brave and the free

471
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:52,308
The shrine of each patriot's devotion

472
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:56,729
A world offers homage to thee

473
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,942
Thy mandates make heroes assemble

474
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:05,780
When liberty's form stands in view

475
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:10,451
Thy banners make tyranny tremble

476
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:14,706
When borne by the red, white and blue

477
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,126
When borne by the red, white and blue

478
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:23,965
When borne by the red, white and blue

479
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:27,969
Thy banners make tyranny tremble

480
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:32,765
When borne by the red, white and blue

481
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,908
I'm sure we're all grateful
to my wife...

482
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:53,411
...Eulalie Mackecknie Shinn,
for leading the singing.

483
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,541
And to Ethel Toffelmier...

484
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,753
...our fine player piano player...

485
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,338
...piano.

486
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,301
As mayor of River City...

487
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:11,679
...I welcome you River Citi-zeeans...

488
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:16,684
...to the Fourth of July exercises set
up indoors here in Madison Gymnasium...

489
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,020
...account the weather being so chancy.

490
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,483
Fourscore-

491
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,371
Fourscore-

492
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,708
Ah.

493
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,795
The members of the school board will
now present a patriotic tableau.

494
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:50,593
Oh. Oh. The members of the school board
will not present a patriotic tableau.

495
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,886
Oh.

496
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,390
Some disagreement about costumes,
I suppose.

497
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,893
Instead the Wa Tan Ye girls...

498
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,354
...of the local wigwam of Hiawatha...

499
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,648
...will present a spectacle. My wife.

500
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:13,241
In which my wife, Eulalie Mackecknie
Shinn, will take a leading part.

501
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,939
I will now count to 20
in the Indian tongue.

502
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,783
Ah! I'm shot! Ho-ho!

503
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,293
Who set off that firecracker?

504
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,545
Tommy Djilas did it. Tommy did it!

505
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,047
Yes, Tommy Djilas.

506
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:13,134
Tommy Djilas, I wouldn't leave
if I were you.

507
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,430
Mrs. Shinn...

508
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,642
...will recover.

509
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:31,152
No thanks to a certain young ruffian
who is a disgrace to our city.

510
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,655
Fourscore...

511
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,492
...and seven years ago our-

512
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:44,457
The Paine's Fireworks Spectacle,
"Last Days of Pomp-ee-eye"...

513
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:48,294
...will take place at 9: 30,
providing it isn't raining.

514
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:52,590
It'll be over at the Madison Picnic Park
in the far meadow.

515
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,469
- Across the creek from the pest house.
- What's all this talk about rain?

516
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:57,970
The Gazette predicted fair!

517
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,473
That's why we prepared for a storm.

518
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,059
My paper's accurate
most of the time, Jacey.

519
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,353
I wouldn't last long
in the banking business...

520
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,063
...being accurate most of the time.

521
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,820
Will members of the school board
stop bickering in public?

522
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,780
Never mind!

523
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,532
Fourscore-

524
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,869
- We heard there's a pool table in town!
- That's what I heard.

525
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,956
Just a minute!
- Is it a pool table or isn't it?

526
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,375
Allow me to get on with the exercises.

527
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:31,504
We don't want any more exercises until
we get this pool table matter settled.

528
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,263
Let's protect our children!

529
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,057
We've got to protect our children!

530
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,187
Resist sin and corruption!

531
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,565
Resist sin and corruption!

532
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,741
Let's smite that devil
and keep our young boys pure!

533
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,202
Pure boys!

534
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,127
Folks, listen.

535
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,629
May I have your attention, please?

536
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,256
Attention, please.

537
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,341
I can deal with the trouble, friends

538
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,385
With a wave of my hand, this very hand!

539
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:23,306
Please observe me if you will
I'm Professor Harold Hill

540
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,975
And I'm here to organize
The River City Boys Band

541
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,562
Oh, think, my friends
How can any pool table

542
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,606
Ever hope to compete
With a gold trombone?

543
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,444
Remember, my friends
What a handful of trumpet players

544
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,030
Did to the famous
Fabled walls of Jericho

545
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:42,742
Oh billiard parlor walls
Come a-tumbling down

546
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,744
Well, a band'll do it, my friends

547
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,787
Oh, yes, I said a boys' band.
Do you hear me?

548
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,123
I said River City got
To have a boys' band

549
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,666
And I mean she needs it today

550
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:54,795
Well, Professor Harold Hill's on hand
River City's going to have her boys' band

551
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,631
As sure as the Lord made
little green apples.

552
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,174
And that band's going to be in uniform:

553
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,551
Johnny, Willy, Teddy, Fred!

554
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,970
You'll see the glitter
of crashing cymbals...

555
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:07,433
...and hear the thunder of rolling drums
and the shimmer of trumpets. Tam-tada!

556
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:10,978
And you'll feel something akin
to the electric thrill I once enjoyed...

557
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,146
...when Gilmore...

558
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,815
...Pat Conway, the great Creatore...

559
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,692
...W. C. Handy...

560
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,862
...and John Philip Sousa...

561
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,366
...all came to town
on the very same historic day!

562
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,997
76 trombones led the big parade

563
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,000
With 110 cornets close at hand

564
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:37,672
They were followed by rows and rows
Of the finest virtuosos

565
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,175
The cream of every famous band

566
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,387
76 trombones caught the morning sun

567
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,848
With 110 cornets right behind

568
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,103
There were more than a thousand reeds
Springing up like weeds

569
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:55,523
There were horns
Of every shape and kind

570
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:59,235
There were copper-bottom timpani
In horse platoons

571
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:03,197
Thundering, thundering
All along the way

572
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:06,742
Double bell euphoniums
And big bassoons

573
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,037
Each bassoon
Having his big fat say

574
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,708
There were 50 mounted cannon
In the battery

575
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,670
Thundering, thundering
Louder than before

576
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,382
Clarinets of every size
And trumpeters who'd improvise

577
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,385
A full octave higher than the score

578
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,053
Whoo!

579
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,570
76 trombones hit the counterpoint

580
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:45,906
While 110 cornets blazed away

581
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:50,077
To the rhythm of Hark! Hark! Hark!
All the kids began to march

582
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,205
And they're marching still right today

583
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,911
There ain't nothing like a brass band
to stir a fella up.

584
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,497
When I hear them trombones...

585
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:07,251
It's them peck horns that really does it.

586
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:10,254
I bet you Estherville
ain't got anything like it.

587
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,172
Or even Des Moines.

588
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:17,303
I'll stake my River City band
against any town west of Chicago.

589
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,514
What band?

590
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:25,311
Honestly! A bunch of grown men.

591
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,651
Along comes this fly-by-night salesman
and you're all taken in.

592
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:39,700
She's right.
The man's a by-God spellbinder!

593
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:43,912
I haven't seen people so excited since
Frank Gotch and Strangler Lewis...

594
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,374
...lay on the mat for three and a half hours
without moving a muscle.

595
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,294
Oh, but that was exciting!

596
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,587
Never mind!

597
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,839
Men, this calls for emergency action.

598
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,258
I want that man's credentials.

599
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,764
Grab that hoodlum!
He almost blew up Mrs. Shinn.

600
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,682
Great honk! Let me go!

601
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,602
Much obliged.
Have to make an example of this one.

602
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,188
Everything the ringleader does
the gang does.

603
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,689
You wild kid, you!

604
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,399
Hanging around my oldest girl.

605
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,152
His father is one of them Nithelanians.

606
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,529
- You wild kid, you!
- What'd I do?

607
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:21,241
- Tagging after my oldest girl.
- I wasn't either tagging.

608
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,534
Don't contradict me!

609
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,537
We was just walking together.
Great honk!

610
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:29,375
Watch your phraseology. I know what
you was doing. Little Grade seen you.

611
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,961
Stay away from my oldest or you'll hear
from me till who-laid-the-rails.

612
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:37,299
I'll talk to you Monday morning about
this band thing. Here in City Hall.

613
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,426
Ten o'clock sharp.

614
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,430
Now, constable!

615
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,015
I'll be responsible for him.

616
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:48,977
This kid's tough. Probably got
his gang waiting around the corner.

617
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,979
I'll be careful.

618
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,774
Tommy, I want to talk to you
about the band.

619
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,443
Gee, professor,
that's for the little kids.

620
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,987
No, not about playing in the band.

621
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,864
Aren't you mechanically minded?

622
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,325
Did you ever do anything with...

623
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,077
...perpetual motion?

624
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,954
Yeah. I nearly had it
a couple times.

625
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:09,832
You did? Well, you're my man.

626
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,793
Do you realize no one has ever
invented a music holder...

627
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,462
...for a marching piccolo player?

628
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,841
There's no place to hang the music.

629
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,094
Great honk! Where can I get wire?

630
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:24,638
Look in your cellar.
That's where people keep wire.

631
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,140
Oh, Tommy.

632
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,433
Yes, sir?

633
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,643
Constable, I'll show you
how to break up a gang.

634
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,270
Young lady!

635
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:32,980
Miss, what's your name?

636
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,648
Zaneeta.

637
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:38,652
I didn't have any idea you was
beckoning to me. Ye gods!

638
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,654
- Do you know Tommy Djilas?
- Well-

639
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:44,032
Now, Tommy, this is Zaneeta.
Escort the young lady home.

640
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,327
Only I'm not going home.
I have to go to the library.

641
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:48,537
Ye gods!

642
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:53,792
Then escort the young lady home
by way of the library, uh-huh...

643
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,171
...by way of the Candy Kitchen.

644
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,006
Yes, sir.

645
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,591
Do I have to?

646
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,134
Oh, you have to.

647
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,427
Yes, sir!

648
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,012
Ye gods!

649
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,014
Professor.

650
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,184
You're a bright young fella,
only you made a couple mistakes.

651
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,853
- Oh?
- The mayor owns that billiard parlor...

652
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,605
...and that new pool table.

653
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:17,816
You don't say?
What was my other mistake?

654
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,401
That Zaneeta.

655
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,571
She's the mayor's oldest girl.

656
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,520
Good evening, ladies.

657
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,318
Just a minute, Professor Hill.

658
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,780
Sorry, we're the school board
and we need your credentials.

659
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,449
- Academic certificates.
- Nothing of the kind!

660
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,284
We need letters and papers.

661
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,328
Make him put up a bond.

662
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,038
What am I hearing?

663
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,456
You, sir.

664
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,710
Say "ice cream"

665
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:22,089
- Ice cream. But I don't sing-
- Talk, then.

666
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,423
Down here

667
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,551
Ice cream

668
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,928
Ice cream.

669
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,138
Talk slow

670
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,975
Ice cream

671
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:34,935
You see? Singing is just...

672
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,104
Sustained talking

673
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,313
Now you, sir.

674
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,523
Ice cream

675
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,317
Now you, sir.
Now you, sir!

676
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:47,948
Ice cream

677
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:53,453
From now on you won't see one of
those men without the other three.

678
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,038
Professor, you're wrong.

679
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:58,750
Why, they've hated each other
for 15 years.

680
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,044
Ice cream

681
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,714
Ice cream

682
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:09,052
Ice cream

683
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,432
Go ahead, Mom.
I'll be there in a minute.

684
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:22,274
How can there be

685
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:29,656
Any sin in sincere?

686
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:35,662
Where is the good in goodbye?

687
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,301
Your apprehensions confuse me, dear.

688
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:55,349
Puzzle and mystify

689
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,978
Tell me

690
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:04,441
What can be fair

691
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:10,197
In farewell, dear?

692
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:16,119
Why one single star shines above?

693
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:26,046
How can there be any sin in

694
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:29,716
Sincere?

695
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:40,185
Aren't we sincerely

696
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:45,524
In love?

697
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,050
- I don't suppose you live alone or anything-
- No.

698
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,847
- I have wonderful caramels at the hotel-
- Mr. Hill.

699
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,057
Oh, please, please!

700
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:20,934
Professor Hill.

701
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,937
Professor? Of what?

702
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,982
What college gives a degree
for accosting women...

703
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,276
...like a rowdy at a public dance hall?

704
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,029
I wouldn't know.
I'm a Conservatory man.

705
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:34,489
Gary, Indiana.
Gold Medal class of '05.

706
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,951
Even should that happen
to be true, Mr. Hill...

707
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:41,288
...I am not as easily mesmerized
as some people in town.

708
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,708
It's only fair to tell you
I'm not impressed by your credentials...

709
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:48,170
...which I've not seen,
nor your manners, which I have!

710
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,722
It's a golden key, as it were.

711
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,600
Your key to the magic world of music.

712
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:04,686
None of our family's ever been
what you'd call musical.

713
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,564
Madam, that you do not know.

714
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:12,819
Now the main thing is imagination
and proper instruction. Ah!

715
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,655
You, young man, repeat after me.

716
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,077
I love music, Mommy

717
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,454
I love music, Mommy

718
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,664
Now you, young man.

719
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,167
Me too, Mommy

720
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,128
Me too, Mommy

721
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,297
Madam, it's amazing!

722
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,425
Two members of the same family
with absolutely perfect pitch.

723
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,680
Sign here, madam.

724
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,730
You sure cut a swath down
at the high school yesterday.

725
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,983
- Yeah.
- When you talked about them trombones...

726
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,152
...you looked just like you used to
back in Joplin.

727
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,279
Joplin?

728
00:51:56,446 --> 00:52:00,867
Yeah, when you used to imitate that
Italian bandleader in the park.

729
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,036
Oh, yeah.

730
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:09,417
Ra ta ta ta ta ta
Ram ta ra ta ram

731
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,672
That's kid stuff.

732
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,216
I'm in rare form these days, son.

733
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:19,302
Just keep your eye on me
for the next four weeks.

734
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,848
Four weeks? You used to get
the instruments in 10 days.

735
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,643
I still do, but it takes
four weeks for the uniforms.

736
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,563
Uniforms? You've added uniforms?

737
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:32,524
Uniforms and instruction books.

738
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:35,193
Why warm up if
you're not going to pitch?

739
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:39,739
You can't pass yourself off as
a music professor. You can't read music.

740
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:43,034
I have a revolutionary new method,
the Think System.

741
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,661
You don't bother with notes.

742
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,912
My boy...

743
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,041
...someday reading music is
going to be absolutely obsolete.

744
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:53,962
I hope it's soon. In four weeks
these people will want to hear music.

745
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,257
But when the uniforms arrive
they forget everything else.

746
00:52:57,465 --> 00:53:00,302
At least long enough for me
to collect and leave.

747
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,679
This is a refined operation, son.

748
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:06,016
I've got it timed down to
the wave of the brakeman's hand...

749
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:08,727
...on the last train out of town.

750
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,909
- Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening, ladies.

751
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,291
Good evening, ladies.
Oh.

752
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:32,626
Professor Hill...

753
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,252
...we're all agog.

754
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,297
Oh, yes, simply agog!

755
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:40,217
- On the qui vive.
- Everyone's excited about the band.

756
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:43,178
I'm Ethel Toffelmier,
the pianola girl.

757
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,971
And this is Avis Grubb.

758
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,890
- How do you do?
- And Mrs. Hicks.

759
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,517
- Hello.
- And Mrs. Squires.

760
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:53,146
And, of course, you've met
Eulalie Mackecknie Shinn.

761
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,815
- Our mayor's wife.
- Yes, indeed.

762
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,984
Oh, yes.

763
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,446
Isn't it exciting, Eulalie?

764
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,782
I couldn't say.

765
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,825
Oh, no, I could not say.

766
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:08,495
I could not say at this time.

767
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,331
My husband will wish to investigate,
I'm sure.

768
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,792
And naturally I'm reticent.

769
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,795
Oh, yes. I'm reticent.

770
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,756
Yes, of course.
I understand, Mrs. Shinn.

771
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:23,301
But part of my music plans
include a committee on the dance.

772
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,928
And I was thinking-

773
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,975
Do that again, Mrs. Shinn.

774
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,477
Do what? What did I do?

775
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,604
Your foot, the way you just raised it.

776
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:38,191
Oh, well, I have a bunion there
that bothers me.

777
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,901
What grace!

778
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,821
Oh, Mr. Hill.

779
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,823
What natural flow of rhythm!

780
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,449
Oh, Mr. Hill.

781
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,952
What expression of line and movement!

782
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,706
You must accept chairmanship...

783
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:56,626
...of the ladies' auxiliary for the
classic dance. Mustn't she, ladies?

784
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:02,716
Mrs. Shinn, your every move
bespeaks Delsarte.

785
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,010
Will you? Will you?

786
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:06,469
Say yes, Mrs. Shinn.

787
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,846
Well, I-

788
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,723
That is-

789
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,559
Dancing? Well!

790
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:13,768
Then you accept?

791
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,478
Indeed! And I'd like to say-

792
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,814
Thank you, Mrs. Shinn.

793
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,149
Oh...

794
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,656
Now, the young lady
who teaches the piano.

795
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,118
Marian Paroo, I believe.

796
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,745
Oh!

797
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,582
After all, she is the librarian.

798
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,542
She must've picked him out
the first crack out of the box.

799
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:38,752
Talking up to a man like that.

800
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:41,755
He wouldn't talk about her if she
didn't try turkey-talking to him.

801
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,923
Ought to take her ticket
and punch it for her.

802
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,550
Picked her out first crack
like a cheap jack.

803
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:46,968
Not much pick to her.

804
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,678
- Pick a little, talk a lot.
- Pick a little, talk a little.

805
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,722
- Cheep, cheep, cheep.
- Talk a lot, pick a little more.

806
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,307
Pick a little, talk a little

807
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,017
Cheep, cheep, cheep
Talk a lot pick, a little more.

808
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:56,311
Pick a little, talk a little
Pick a little, talk a little

809
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,562
Talk a lot, pick a little more

810
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:06,613
Her kind of woman
doesn't belong on any committee.

811
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,949
Of course, I shouldn't tell you this,
but she advocates dirty books.

812
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,577
- Dirty books?
- Chaucer.

813
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,454
Rabelais.

814
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,122
Balzac!

815
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,293
The worst thing-
I shouldn't tell you this-

816
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,545
- I'll tell.
- The man lived on my street.

817
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,090
- Let me tell.
- No, I'll tell.

818
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:29,177
She made brazen overtures to a man
who never had a friend...

819
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,637
...till she came here.

820
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,390
- Old miser Madison.
- Miser Madison?

821
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,475
- Miser-
- Madison.

822
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:39,813
Madison Picnic Park? Madison Gymnasium?
Madison Hospital? That miser Madison?

823
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,107
Exactly! Who did he think
he was, anyway?

824
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,608
I should say!

825
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:44,984
The showoff!

826
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,694
He gave the town the library too.

827
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:50,156
That's just it. When he died
he left the library to the city.

828
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,409
But he left all the books to her.

829
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:55,829
She was seen going and coming
from his place.

830
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,705
Oh, yes! That woman made...

831
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,834
Brazen overtures
With a gild-edge guarantee

832
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,502
She had a golden glint in her eye

833
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,337
And a silver voice
With a counterfeit ring

834
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:08,591
Just melt her down and you'll reveal
A lump of lead as cold as steel here

835
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,010
Where woman's heart should be!

836
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:14,431
He left River City
The library building

837
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,350
But he left all the books to her

838
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,811
Chaucer.

839
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,396
Rabelais.

840
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,314
Balzac!

841
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,653
Just a minute here, professor.

842
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,698
Sorry. We need your credentials.

843
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:35,952
Certainly, gentlemen. I have just
what you want over at my hotel.

844
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,495
Please come with me.

845
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,830
Good night, ladies!

846
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:42,167
Good night, ladies

847
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:45,545
Good night, ladies

848
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,548
Good night, ladies

849
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:52,469
We're going to leave you now

850
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:55,889
Farewell, ladies

851
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:59,225
Farewell, ladies

852
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:02,145
Farewell, ladies

853
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,063
We're going

854
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:08,401
To leave you now

855
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,393
Can I visit the horses?

856
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,771
- "May l"?
- May I visit the horses?

857
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:48,149
It's not visiting hours, but all right.

858
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,614
What a beautiful evening.

859
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:58,910
Not bad at all for a little place
like River City, lowa.

860
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:04,374
Come to the boarding house.
We got chicken croquettes tonight.

861
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:07,001
No, I'm not thinking about food.

862
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:10,129
Going to line yourself up
a little canoodling?

863
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:13,341
No, I got something to look up
at the library.

864
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,677
From what I've heard...

865
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:19,806
Let me fix you up with
Myrtle Toffelmier, Ethel's sister.

866
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,225
Real nice girl.
Teaches Sunday school.

867
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:25,812
No wide-eyed, eager, wholesome,
innocent Sunday school teacher for me.

868
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:30,024
That kind of gal spins webs
no spider ever- Listen, boy.

869
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:32,277
A gal who trades on all that purity

870
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:35,697
Merely wants to trade
My independence for her security

871
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,574
The only affirmative she will file

872
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,993
Refers to marching down the aisle

873
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:43,454
No golden glorious gleaming
Pristine goddess

874
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:44,664
No, sir

875
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:48,751
For no Diana do I play faun
I can tell you that right now

876
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,837
I snarl, I hiss

877
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,298
How can ignorance be compared to bliss?

878
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:55,383
I spark, I fizz

879
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,844
For the lady who knows what time it is

880
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,096
I cheer and I rave

881
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:03,057
For the virtue I'm too late to save

882
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,518
The sadder but wiser girl for me

883
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:17,405
No bright-eyed blushing breathless
Baby-doll baby

884
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:20,533
No, sir
That kind of child ties knots

885
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,702
No sailor ever knew

886
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,038
I prefer to take a chance

887
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:27,332
On a more adult romance

888
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:30,084
No dewy young miss who keeps resisting

889
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,378
All the time she keeps insisting

890
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:36,215
No wide-eyed wholesome innocent female
No, sir!

891
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:39,469
Why, she's the fisherman
I'm the fish, you see

892
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,722
I flinch, I shy

893
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,183
When the lass with
The delicate air goes by

894
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:47,226
I smile, I grin

895
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,812
When the gal with a touch of sin
Walks in

896
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:51,773
I hope and I pray

897
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,942
For a Hester to win just one more "A"

898
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:58,446
The sadder but wiser girl's
The girl for me

899
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:02,742
The sadder but wiser girl for me

900
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,074
It's all right.

901
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:45,952
I know everything and it makes
no difference.

902
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,664
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Mr. Madison.

903
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:53,835
You were probably very young.
Anyone can make a mistake.

904
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,128
What?

905
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:00,466
No apologies. No explanations.

906
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,553
You see, I'll only be in town
a short while...

907
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:06,639
...and the sadder but wiser girl for me.

908
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,183
Would you please make
your selection and leave?

909
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,935
I have.

910
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,937
- What do you want to take out?
- The librarian.

911
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:14,647
Shh.

912
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:16,816
Quiet, please.

913
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,027
The librarian.

914
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,115
You're not listening, Marian.

915
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,326
Look.

916
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:34,250
Marian

917
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,545
Marbles.

918
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,922
Six steelies, eight aggies,
a dozen peewees...

919
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:43,217
...and one big glassie with
an American flag in the middle.

920
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,052
- I think I'll drop them.
- No!

921
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,721
Shh.

922
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:52,685
Madam librarian

923
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,524
Oh, what can I do, my dear

924
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,568
To catch your ear?

925
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,653
I love you madly, madly

926
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,031
Madam Librarian
Marian

927
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:08,242
Heaven help us
If the library caught on fire

928
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:11,954
And the volunteer hose-brigade men
Had to whisper the news to

929
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:16,709
Marian

930
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:25,343
Madam librarian

931
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:31,224
Oh, what can I say, my dear

932
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,351
To make it clear?

933
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,144
I need you badly, badly

934
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,522
Madam Librarian
Marian

935
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,817
If I stumbled and I busted
My whatchamacallit

936
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:44,487
I could lie on your floor unnoticed
Till my body had turned to

937
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:49,242
Carrion

938
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:57,917
Madam librarian

939
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,923
Now in the moonlight

940
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,426
A man could sing it

941
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:13,140
In the moonlight

942
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:20,982
And a fellow would know
That his darling

943
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,025
Had heard every word of his song

944
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,944
With the moonlight

945
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:29,949
Helping along

946
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:34,036
But when I try in here

947
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:36,038
To tell you, dear

948
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,165
I love you madly, madly

949
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,543
Madam Librarian
Marian

950
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:42,628
It's a long-lost cause

951
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:44,130
I can never win

952
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:46,632
For the civilized world accepts

953
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,593
As unforgivable sin

954
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,469
Any talking out loud

955
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,805
With any librarian

956
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:58,728
Such as Marian

957
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:07,194
Madam librarian

958
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,001
Tommy!

959
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,269
Shh.

960
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,839
But when I try in here

961
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:15,758
To tell you, dear

962
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:18,094
I love you madly, madly

963
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:19,845
Madam Librarian
Marian

964
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,598
It's a long-lost cause
I can never win

965
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:26,602
For the civilized world accepts
As unforgivable sin

966
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:30,856
Any talking out loud
With any librarian

967
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:32,691
Such as

968
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:35,653
Ladies Dance Committee
meets Tuesday night.

969
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:36,904
Marian

970
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:38,489
Marshmallow?

971
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:44,537
Madam librarian

972
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:03,764
- Hey, professor.
- Hello, Tommy.

973
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:05,391
- I think I got it.
- Yeah?

974
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,393
My music holder for
a marching piccolo player.

975
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,603
- Oh.
- I still haven't worked out...

976
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,105
...a couple of minor flaws.

977
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:14,400
Even Edison doesn't always
get it right the first time.

978
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:18,612
When you hold it tight enough
to keep the music steady...

979
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:22,867
...you cut off the circulation
and you can't wiggle your fingers.

980
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:24,743
And meanwhile...

981
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:26,662
...you could go blind.

982
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,248
I'd say it still needs a little work.

983
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:31,792
Like to check out
a few prospects with me?

984
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,169
Hey.

985
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:34,920
You mean you're going in there?

986
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:37,590
I don't see any quarantine sign.

987
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:39,967
Gee, I got to hand it to you, professor.

988
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,427
See you later.

989
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,053
I hope.

990
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:53,397
Just a minute here.

991
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,108
Are you soliciting?
You haven't got a license.

992
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:57,818
Why, no, Mr. Mayor.

993
01:09:58,027 --> 01:09:59,820
Mr. Mayor, I collect doorbells.

994
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,865
And this specimen has an
unusual tone quality-

995
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:05,367
Flattery will not avail you.

996
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:08,954
Soliciting is statutory in this county.
Malfeasance without a permit.

997
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:11,373
Why haven't you been over at City Hall?

998
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:15,085
- I must have just missed you.
- None of your alibis!

999
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:17,630
- Your hand. Isn't that amazing?
- Hmm?

1000
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:18,964
What? What?

1001
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:22,134
That spread of the little finger.
It's hereditary.

1002
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:23,969
- It is? What does that mean?
- Mm.

1003
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,055
It means your son's little finger...

1004
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:29,475
...is perfectly situated for
the spit valve on a flugelhorn.

1005
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,061
- Is that good?
- Good?

1006
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,688
It means America finally has
an artist who can...

1007
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,899
...flugel the "Minute Waltz"
in 50 seconds.

1008
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:39,652
- How can I get one of those horns?
- Sign here.

1009
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:41,111
Yes, sir.

1010
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:42,821
Fine, fine!

1011
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:44,823
That'll be 17 dollars import fee.

1012
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:47,493
Just think, I could've
missed this whole thing.

1013
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,495
My son could've-

1014
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:53,832
I haven't got any son!

1015
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:55,668
Oh, George.

1016
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:57,962
I never had a son.

1017
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,172
- I never said you did.
- What do you know?

1018
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:03,259
I'd certainly know if I gave you a son.

1019
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:06,011
- I'm not talking to you.
- Who are you talking to?

1020
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,471
- Him.
- Who?

1021
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,934
Never mind!

1022
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:16,021
Zaneeta, call Dr. Pyne for your father.

1023
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:22,278
Yes, my dear Mrs. Paroo,
you must realize...

1024
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:25,030
...that only one
out of every 78 adults...

1025
01:11:25,197 --> 01:11:28,742
...has a ganglion that reaches
the ligature clear down to the apex.

1026
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:32,871
This automatically turns your
entire face into an amazing embouchure.

1027
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:35,624
I never had a sick day
in my life, doctor.

1028
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:37,710
Ah. Professor.

1029
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:40,838
Professor! What shall I do for it?

1030
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:42,548
No, you don't understand.

1031
01:11:42,756 --> 01:11:45,968
I'm trying to tell you,
you have the facial characteristics...

1032
01:11:46,176 --> 01:11:48,220
...of a cornet virtuoso.

1033
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:50,764
If your boy has that same firm chin...

1034
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,225
...and those splendid cheek muscles,
oh-ho-ho...

1035
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:55,019
By George!

1036
01:11:55,519 --> 01:11:57,688
Not that he'd ever really be great.

1037
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,481
Is that so?

1038
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:01,900
And in the name of
St. Bridget, why not?

1039
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:05,362
All of the really great
cornet players were Irish.

1040
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,990
O'Clark, O'Mendez, O'Klein...

1041
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,367
But, professor, we are Irish.

1042
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,077
No!

1043
01:12:12,244 --> 01:12:13,912
No, really? That clinches it.

1044
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:17,666
Sign here, Madam.
Your boy was born to play the cornet.

1045
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:22,087
Fine, fine!
That'll be 7 dollars earnest money.

1046
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:25,924
Nothing more due until
the opening of band practice.

1047
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:30,095
Thank you. And I'll need your boy's
measurements for his uniform.

1048
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:31,680
His uniform?

1049
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:33,057
- Oh, yes-
- Ah!

1050
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:36,643
- Winthrop!
- Well, hello there, son.

1051
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:39,563
Why, certainly, his uniform.

1052
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:42,483
And there won't be
a penny due until delivery.

1053
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:46,987
Which gives him four weeks to enjoy,
anticipate, imagine at no cost.

1054
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:48,947
Never allow the demands of tomorrow...

1055
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:52,493
...to interfere with the pleasures
and excitements of today.

1056
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,119
Would it have a-?

1057
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:56,372
- A...
- A...

1058
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:00,751
A stripe! Why, certainly, my boy!

1059
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:04,630
A wide, red stripe down each side.
What do you think of that?

1060
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,680
You'll have to excuse Winthrop.

1061
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:16,475
We can't get him to say
three words a day.

1062
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:18,185
Not even to us.

1063
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,771
If you can get him to play
in that band...

1064
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:23,482
...you'll have St. Michael's
own way with you.

1065
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,652
But if anybody can do it,
I bet you can. Heh-heh.

1066
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:27,820
Thank you.

1067
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:31,782
You've a gift of the blarney about you,
no mistaking that.

1068
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:34,326
- Where are you from, my boy?
- Gary, Indiana.

1069
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:35,536
I knew it!

1070
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:37,162
Where'd you say?

1071
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:40,791
Gary, Indiana.
Gary Conservatory was my alma mater.

1072
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,126
Was she now?

1073
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:45,629
Yes, indeed.
Gold Medal Class of '05.

1074
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:48,882
Gary, Indiana

1075
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:51,260
What a wonderful name!

1076
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:55,180
Named for Elbert Gary
Of judiciary fame

1077
01:13:55,722 --> 01:13:57,057
Gary, Indiana

1078
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,852
As a Shakespeare would say

1079
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:03,730
Trips along softly
On the tongue this way

1080
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:05,941
Gary, Indiana

1081
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,526
Gary, Indiana

1082
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:09,027
Gary, Indiana

1083
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:11,196
Let me say it once again

1084
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:14,366
Gary, Indiana

1085
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:15,868
Gary, Indiana

1086
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:17,327
Gary, Indiana

1087
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,621
That's the town that knew me when

1088
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:24,126
Now if you'd like to have
A logical explanation

1089
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:28,422
How I happened on
This elegant syncopation

1090
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:32,259
I will say without
A moment of hesitation

1091
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:35,220
There is just one place

1092
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:37,347
That can light my face

1093
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:39,600
Gary, Indiana

1094
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,059
Gary, Indiana

1095
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:42,644
Not Louisiana

1096
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:45,230
Paris, France
New York or Rome

1097
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,900
But Gary, Indiana

1098
01:14:48,108 --> 01:14:49,234
Gary, Indiana

1099
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:51,320
Gary, Indiana

1100
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:53,447
My home sweet home

1101
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:25,896
Gary, Indiana

1102
01:15:26,146 --> 01:15:27,606
Gary, Indiana

1103
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:31,777
Gary, Indiana
My home sweet home

1104
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,156
- Ah!
- Whoa!

1105
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:38,784
Mama!

1106
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:40,786
How do you do, Miss Paroo?

1107
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,746
How do you do?

1108
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:46,667
Of course, Paroo!
I thought the name sounded familiar.

1109
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:50,712
- I've been trying to see you.
- He wants to put Winthrop in the band.

1110
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:52,130
We're not interested.

1111
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:56,009
But Marian dear, the boy might have
his father's musical gift.

1112
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,220
He does have my ganglion, you know.

1113
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:01,431
Your husband is musical?
I'd like to talk to him.

1114
01:16:01,848 --> 01:16:05,477
Do you always burst into people's homes
prying into personal affairs?

1115
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:07,229
We're not interested.

1116
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:08,522
Marian!

1117
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:10,357
There's one for and one against.

1118
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:13,235
Now, why not let
the boy's father decide?

1119
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:15,988
The boy's father is dead.

1120
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,616
Anything else?

1121
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:21,660
I am sorry.

1122
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,496
But all the more reason
he should have this!

1123
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:29,001
My brother is an unhappy child who can't
understand why his father was taken away.

1124
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:33,213
Would you care to explain it to him?
He's been brooding for two years.

1125
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:37,718
And as for your musical tricks,
go into business with a carnival man...

1126
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:40,679
...who sells painted watches
and glass diamond rings!

1127
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:43,640
Musical tricks? Now, Miss Paroo!

1128
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,355
I have a feeling she likes the idea.

1129
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:53,358
A little cautious,
but I admire that in a woman.

1130
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:55,777
I'll be back later in the week.

1131
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:59,364
I do hope you'll excuse Marian.
She's not really-

1132
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:02,534
Please, don't you worry about a thing.

1133
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:07,247
I'm sure that at heart,
she's as lovely as yourself.

1134
01:17:08,832 --> 01:17:11,043
Good day to you, Widow Paroo.

1135
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:38,070
- Has he gone?
- He has. And I hope not forever.

1136
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:40,739
Darling, don't you ever think
of your future?

1137
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:44,409
Now, Mama, a girl's future
doesn't depend on encouraging...

1138
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:46,703
...every fast-talking,
self-centered...

1139
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,081
...woman-chasing traveling man
who comes to town.

1140
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,999
All right, darling. All right.

1141
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:54,670
Only it's a well-known principle that
if you keep the flint in one drawer...

1142
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:57,547
...and the steel in the other
you'll never strike a fire.

1143
01:17:57,714 --> 01:18:00,092
- Mama!
- A fine-looking man.

1144
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:01,426
And educated.

1145
01:18:01,593 --> 01:18:05,180
Gary, Indiana Conservation
class of 'Aught-five.

1146
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:09,976
That he claims his commodity is music
does not, in this case, impress me.

1147
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,145
Nor does anything else about him.

1148
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,730
I give up.

1149
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:17,943
At your age, if you don't mind my asking,
what are you waiting for?

1150
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:21,279
Not for Ed Griner, who backs me
into the history shelf...

1151
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:23,115
...every time he's in the library.

1152
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:24,574
He does?

1153
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:28,620
Or Ed Gammage who has the buggy
with the removable back seat.

1154
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:33,250
If you're waiting for a knight in shining
white armor to come riding up the street...

1155
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:35,919
I'm not waiting for that either.

1156
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:38,213
Then what are you waiting for?

1157
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:41,883
Marian Paroo,
if you don't mind my asking...

1158
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:44,803
...don't you ever think
about being in love?

1159
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,471
Being in love?

1160
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:50,183
Being in love

1161
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:53,645
Used to be my favorite dream

1162
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,147
Oh, yes

1163
01:18:56,898 --> 01:19:00,277
I've been in love

1164
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:05,323
More than anybody else has
I guess

1165
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:10,287
My first love
Heroically ran the streetcar

1166
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:15,417
I tingled at every clang-clang

1167
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:20,088
Next I fell for the principal

1168
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:23,842
But, oh, that teacher who sang

1169
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:26,553
"In the Gloaming"

1170
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:30,849
Knee-deep in love

1171
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:36,188
What a lovely dream
And yet somehow

1172
01:19:36,646 --> 01:19:39,357
Me deep in love's

1173
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:44,863
Only half of what
I'm longing for now

1174
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:49,826
I still love my being
In love with someone

1175
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:53,997
But tell me why couldn't there be

1176
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:59,377
Somebody being in love

1177
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:03,089
With me?

1178
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:07,260
All I want is a plain man

1179
01:20:07,427 --> 01:20:10,138
All I want is a modest man

1180
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:11,932
A quiet man

1181
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:13,809
A gentle man

1182
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:17,020
A straightforward and honest man

1183
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:19,439
To sit with me

1184
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,609
In a cottage somewhere

1185
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:26,029
In the state of lowa

1186
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:31,660
And I would like him to be

1187
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:36,665
More interested in me

1188
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:40,961
Than he is in himself

1189
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:46,216
And more interested in us

1190
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:53,515
Than in me

1191
01:20:55,058 --> 01:21:00,188
And if occasionally he'd ponder

1192
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:05,235
What makes Shakespeare
And Beethoven great

1193
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:10,532
Him I could love till I die

1194
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:17,414
Him I could love

1195
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:21,960
Till I die

1196
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:25,797
Being in love

1197
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:28,800
What a lovely dream
And yet

1198
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:31,261
Somehow

1199
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:35,140
Being in love's

1200
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:40,812
Only half of what
I'm longing for now

1201
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:45,984
And so then
Tonight I'll be in there dreaming

1202
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:49,446
And hoping that someday there'll be

1203
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:51,323
Just once!

1204
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:58,747
Somebody being in love

1205
01:22:00,206 --> 01:22:05,420
With me

1206
01:22:24,522 --> 01:22:25,857
Please, Zaneeta.

1207
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:28,318
I'm supposed to be parallel reading.

1208
01:22:28,526 --> 01:22:30,195
Just to the Candy Kitchen.

1209
01:22:30,403 --> 01:22:32,572
With Mama and Papa shopping
on Center Street?

1210
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,407
Ye gods!

1211
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:35,742
Meet me after supper.

1212
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,787
I can't. It's Epworth League tonight.

1213
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:44,376
- Meet you where?
- The footbridge.

1214
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:46,628
See? Isn't that what I said?

1215
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:49,130
Last time the lumberyard,
now the footbridge.

1216
01:22:49,339 --> 01:22:53,468
Where will we meet after that?
The black hole of Calcutta? Ye gods!

1217
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,053
Shh.

1218
01:22:56,888 --> 01:22:59,891
It's indecent to meet boys
at the footbridge.

1219
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:03,395
First thing after supper?

1220
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:06,564
All right.

1221
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:08,984
- Ye gods!
- Shh.

1222
01:23:41,766 --> 01:23:43,893
The Wells Fargo wagon!

1223
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:45,770
The Wells Fargo wagon?

1224
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:54,821
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon

1225
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:56,948
Is a-coming down the street

1226
01:23:57,115 --> 01:24:00,118
Oh, please let it be for me

1227
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:04,164
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming down the street

1228
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:07,250
I wish, I wish I knew what it could be

1229
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:10,795
I got a box of maple sugar
On my birthday

1230
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:14,424
In March I got a gray mackinaw

1231
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:18,470
And once I got some grapefruit
From Tampa

1232
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:22,390
Montgomery Ward sent me a bathtub
And a crosscut saw

1233
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:25,477
- Is that the first thing I said or not?
- Yes, George.

1234
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:29,355
Yes, the very first thing I said,
or I'll eat hay with the horse.

1235
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:31,691
Get his credentials, I said...

1236
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,360
...morning of July 4th...

1237
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:35,653
...19 and 12.

1238
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:39,240
Now look! My wife is off
dancing at any and all hours...

1239
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:41,201
...instead of in the home.

1240
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:46,122
And the school board is singing
instead of tending to city matters.

1241
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:48,875
My oldest girl is boodling around
with some wild kid.

1242
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:52,087
And my business's fell off so far
I can't find the balance sheet.

1243
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:56,966
I found something interesting in this book
about Professor Hill's alma mater.

1244
01:24:57,133 --> 01:25:00,011
I know all about it.
It's all I can get out of him.

1245
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,931
Gary Conservatory, class of '05.

1246
01:25:03,139 --> 01:25:07,185
If you take time to read it,
you wouldn't have to look any further.

1247
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:08,394
It's on page-

1248
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:11,397
Papa, the Wells Fargo wagon
is coming this way.

1249
01:25:11,564 --> 01:25:12,649
The Wells Fargo wagon?

1250
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:14,859
It could be the band instruments!

1251
01:25:15,026 --> 01:25:16,945
- The band instruments?
- But Mayor Shinn!

1252
01:25:17,153 --> 01:25:18,863
Later, later.

1253
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:24,452
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming now

1254
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:27,914
Is it the prepaid surprise or C. O. D.?

1255
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:29,374
It could be curtains

1256
01:25:29,582 --> 01:25:32,043
- Or dishes
- Or a double boiler

1257
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:33,837
- Or it could be
Yes, it could be

1258
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:35,588
Yes, you're right
It surely could be

1259
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:38,800
- Something special
Something very, very special now

1260
01:25:39,008 --> 01:25:42,053
Just for me

1261
01:25:43,012 --> 01:25:46,933
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming down the street

1262
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:49,561
Oh, don't let him pass my door

1263
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:54,232
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming down the street

1264
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:57,152
I wish I knew what he was coming for

1265
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:01,072
I got some salmon from Seattle
Last September

1266
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:04,784
And I expect a new rocking chair

1267
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:08,413
I hope I get my raisins from Fresno

1268
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:12,750
The D. A. R. Have sent a cannon
For the courthouse square

1269
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:17,714
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming now

1270
01:26:17,922 --> 01:26:21,342
I don't know how I can ever
Wait to see

1271
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:24,095
It could be something
For thomeone who is

1272
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:27,390
No relation
But it could be

1273
01:26:29,058 --> 01:26:30,768
Something special

1274
01:26:32,061 --> 01:26:35,273
Just for me

1275
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:39,194
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming

1276
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:43,198
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming

1277
01:26:43,573 --> 01:26:47,619
Oh-ho, the Wells Fargo wagon
Don't you dare to make a stop

1278
01:26:47,827 --> 01:26:50,205
Until you stop

1279
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:52,916
For me

1280
01:26:59,088 --> 01:27:00,298
Here you are, Winthrop.

1281
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:01,883
My cornet!

1282
01:27:02,091 --> 01:27:04,344
Gee, thanks, professor.

1283
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:09,974
Isn't this the most scrumptious
solid gold thing you ever saw?

1284
01:27:10,141 --> 01:27:12,393
I never thought I'd ever
see anything...

1285
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:16,272
...so scrumptious as this
solid gold thing. Oh, sister!

1286
01:27:17,273 --> 01:27:19,192
Remember, men!
Stay off the streets...

1287
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:23,947
...pay attention to your instruments,
and think about the "Minuet in G."

1292
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:37,543
Round one for you, Mr. Hill.

1293
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:41,214
But I better hear some tooting
out of them horns in short order...

1294
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:45,093
...or I'll see you before
the grand jury at the county theat!

1295
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:48,680
Yes.

1296
01:27:48,846 --> 01:27:51,015
And now, Miss Marian, about that book-

1297
01:27:51,182 --> 01:27:53,017
George, come along.

1298
01:27:53,184 --> 01:27:55,520
Tern pus fug it.

1299
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:58,147
You watch your phraseology!

1300
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:02,694
Go along, if you want. I must
get something from the librarian.

1301
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:04,946
About that book...

1302
01:28:11,035 --> 01:28:13,454
Dance Committee meets Tuesdays
at the school.

1303
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:15,873
They'll be counting on you.

Hurry along!

1316
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:15,892
Let's start...

1317
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:19,812
...with our posture exercises.

1318
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:33,826
Lovely, ladies. Lovely!

1319
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:35,286
Now turn.

1320
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:37,288
Take the body with you.

1321
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,041
Lovely! Lovely, ladies.

1322
01:29:44,295 --> 01:29:46,798
Now for our Grecian urns.

1323
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:51,928
One Grecian urn.

1324
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:57,100
Two Grecian urns!

1325
01:29:58,768 --> 01:30:01,479
- Oh.
- That's just amazing!

1326
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,232
And a fountain.

1327
01:30:05,983 --> 01:30:09,153
Trickle, trickle, trickle,
trickle, trickle, trickle.

1328
01:30:09,362 --> 01:30:11,864
Splendid, ladies! Splendid!

1329
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,075
Our Delsarte display will be...

1330
01:30:14,283 --> 01:30:16,994
...the highlight of
the ice cream sociable.

1331
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:18,246
Girls!

1332
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:19,539
Oh.

1333
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:23,376
Now once again.
Practice makes perfection...

1334
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:25,044
...which is what we want.

1335
01:30:30,216 --> 01:30:31,592
Then remember, men:

1336
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:34,595
If you want to play
the "Minuet in G"...

1337
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:37,014
...think the "Minuet in G."

1338
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:39,725
A meeting of two minds,
yours and Beethoven's.

1339
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:42,019
- All together now.
- Professor.

1340
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:45,690
I can't even think out
how to hold the horn right.

1341
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:48,401
There's these little spigots
on the side...

1342
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:50,236
...but which one's which?

1343
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:53,489
Aha-ha. Experimentation!

1344
01:30:54,198 --> 01:30:55,491
Trial and error!

1345
01:30:56,492 --> 01:30:59,203
- Could you show me, professor?
- Oh.

1346
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:03,499
I'll tell you what
the great Giuseppe Creatore...

1347
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:06,002
...said to me once
under like circumstances.

1348
01:31:06,252 --> 01:31:10,006
"Professor Hill," he said,
"that is your instrument.

1349
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:11,466
Hold onto it.

1350
01:31:11,674 --> 01:31:13,050
Cherish it.

1351
01:31:13,217 --> 01:31:15,761
Don't let anybody else play it.
Not even me.

1352
01:31:16,095 --> 01:31:17,555
Not even you.

1353
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:20,725
Until you feel you're ready."

1354
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:23,269
- But-
- Ah-ah-ah-ah.

1355
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:24,937
Yes, sir.

1356
01:31:25,521 --> 01:31:26,564
All together now.

1357
01:31:27,106 --> 01:31:28,983
Over and over.

La di da di da

1362
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:43,080
Take charge.

1363
01:31:43,247 --> 01:31:46,542
Another half-hour at least
on the minuet.

1364
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:14,612
- Strawberry phosphate, please.
- Right with you.

1365
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:25,248
Ye gods!

1366
01:32:26,999 --> 01:32:28,417
Great honk!

1367
01:32:30,127 --> 01:32:33,881
If there's anything you
don't see there, ask for it.

1368
01:32:42,598 --> 01:32:45,309
Oh. Professor Hill, I didn't see you.

1369
01:32:45,476 --> 01:32:46,602
May I join you?

1370
01:32:46,769 --> 01:32:48,271
Well, really, I-

1371
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:51,732
Where? They were seen!
Red-handed! Caught in the act!

1372
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:54,777
- Take your hands off my daughter!
- Papa!

1373
01:32:54,944 --> 01:32:58,781
Mr. Shinn, Your Honor, your daughter
and I are going steady behind your back.

1374
01:32:58,948 --> 01:33:02,159
- Why, you-!
- We'd rather do it in front of your back.

1375
01:33:02,326 --> 01:33:03,369
Do what?

1376
01:33:03,536 --> 01:33:05,329
- Well, uh-
- Never mind!

1377
01:33:05,538 --> 01:33:07,331
Zaneeta's scared of you but I'm not.

1378
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:11,043
I should think you'd hate to have your
daughter scared of you. Great honk!

1379
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:14,130
I'll warn you once more:
If you ever touch my daughter...

1380
01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:16,674
...I'll horsewhip you
till hell won't have it!

1381
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:17,883
Now, George!

1382
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:20,636
Not one poop out of you, Madam.

1383
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:22,263
I think he means "peep."

1384
01:33:24,932 --> 01:33:26,017
Yeah.

1385
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:31,147
Now get out of this public emporium!

1386
01:33:31,522 --> 01:33:34,483
I got as much right in
a public emporium as anybody!

1387
01:33:34,692 --> 01:33:36,736
How do you get any right around here?

1388
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:40,364
Aiding and abetting the swindling
activities of this cymbal salesman!

1389
01:33:40,573 --> 01:33:43,492
You know what I see written
all over you? Reform school!

1390
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:44,910
Now get out!

1391
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:46,537
Get out, you wild kid!

1392
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:48,122
Papa, please!

1393
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:53,127
It's Capulets like you make blood
in the marketplace. Ye gods!

1394
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:56,589
You watch your phraseology,
young woman!

1395
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:58,215
Go home.

1396
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:04,472
Taking up with wild kids
from the wrong side of town!

1397
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:06,223
If I could make you understand-

1398
01:34:06,432 --> 01:34:08,225
Well, you can't!

1399
01:34:08,851 --> 01:34:10,561
And thanks for the buggy ride.

1400
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:13,731
I read that book you gave me
from cover to cover...

1401
01:34:13,898 --> 01:34:15,316
...and didn't find a thing.

1402
01:34:15,524 --> 01:34:16,567
Mr. Mayor, please-

1403
01:34:16,734 --> 01:34:17,943
I'll settle your hash...

1404
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:20,946
...as soon as I get these premises
off my oldest girl.

1405
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:24,283
- Yes.
- But in the meantime...

1406
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:26,619
...I'm vouching for Tommy Djilas.

1407
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:29,330
He has the confidence
of every kid in town.

1408
01:34:29,538 --> 01:34:31,707
You'll be waiting to shake his hand...

1409
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,918
...when our band
plays its first concert.

1410
01:34:34,126 --> 01:34:36,545
By that time,
my fine young feathered...

1411
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:39,048
...my feathered young,
my feathered fine-

1412
01:34:39,256 --> 01:34:40,841
Never mind!

1413
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:47,932
Oliver! Jacey! Ewart! Olin!

1414
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:50,976
I want that man's references
and I want them tonight.

1415
01:34:51,185 --> 01:34:54,563
He's slipperier than
a Mississippi... sturgeon.

1416
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:57,942
I think Mayor Shinn behaved abominably.

1417
01:34:58,150 --> 01:35:01,278
And it was wonderful of you,
sticking up for Tommy Djilas.

1418
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:04,198
- Oh, that was nothing.
- Yes, it was.

1419
01:35:04,573 --> 01:35:09,120
A man can't go back on his principles
because personal risk is involved.

1420
01:35:09,328 --> 01:35:10,913
What does the poet say?

1421
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:15,126
A coward dies 1000 deaths.
A brave man...

1422
01:35:15,292 --> 01:35:17,128
...only 500.

1423
01:35:17,294 --> 01:35:18,963
- Something like that.
- Thank you.

1424
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,340
Get his papers or get him in jail!

1425
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:23,342
I couldn't make myself clearer...

1426
01:35:23,551 --> 01:35:25,636
...if I was a buttonhook
in well water.

1427
01:35:30,474 --> 01:35:33,144
I want to talk to you
about Winthrop's cornet.

1428
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:37,273
A beautiful instrument.
Hammered brass, mother-of-pearl keys.

1429
01:35:37,481 --> 01:35:41,026
But he never touches it. He said
you told him it wasn't necessary.

1430
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:43,154
You must understand-

1431
01:35:43,362 --> 01:35:46,115
Something about a "Think System."

1432
01:35:46,323 --> 01:35:49,660
He says if he thinks the "Minuet in G"
he can play it.

1433
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:52,997
I admit it's still
in the experimental stages.

1434
01:35:53,205 --> 01:35:56,876
To a seasoned professional like yourself
it may seem ludicrous.

1435
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:59,295
You mustn't say that.

1436
01:36:01,213 --> 01:36:02,840
- I mustn't?
- No.

1437
01:36:03,257 --> 01:36:06,844
Throughout history the true
originator is always laughed at.

1438
01:36:07,052 --> 01:36:10,556
I hope you don't class me with
those small minds who ridiculed-

1439
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:13,559
- Galileo.
- Yes, and his conception of the heavens.

1440
01:36:13,768 --> 01:36:15,144
Or Fulton.

1441
01:36:15,352 --> 01:36:18,606
- Yes. Or Columbus.
- And his conception of the egg-

1442
01:36:18,814 --> 01:36:20,274
Globe!

1443
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:24,195
The one thing one must remember,
no matter who one is...

1444
01:36:24,361 --> 01:36:25,821
...or what one is working for...

1445
01:36:25,988 --> 01:36:29,200
...one can do anything
if one puts one's mind to it.

1446
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:31,494
Miss Marian...

1447
01:36:31,702 --> 01:36:36,040
...if one could only tell you
how much you've done for one.

1448
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:41,170
I would deem it a great privilege
to talk with you again.

1449
01:36:42,129 --> 01:36:43,798
Well, all I said-

1450
01:36:43,964 --> 01:36:46,509
May one call upon you some evening?

1451
01:36:49,553 --> 01:36:51,680
Any night this week.

1452
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:16,497
Good evening, gentlemen.

1453
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:21,585
Sorry, professor,
but we got our orders.

1454
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:23,504
We all been deputized.

1455
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:25,422
Yes, yes, yes.

1456
01:37:25,631 --> 01:37:27,508
Congratulations. Now let me see.

1457
01:37:27,716 --> 01:37:30,261
Every time I try to give you
those credentials...

1458
01:37:30,469 --> 01:37:32,847
...you always try to
change the subject somehow.

1459
01:37:33,055 --> 01:37:36,559
It's like a conspiracy.
I'll go up in my room and get them.

1460
01:37:37,059 --> 01:37:40,604
- Sorry! Afraid I'll have to go with you.
- Oh, yes.

1461
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:43,232
Let's see if I have my key.

1462
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:45,276
What's this?

1463
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,864
What do you know?

1464
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:53,909
A testimonial from
the only female bassoonist...

1465
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:56,328
...on the Redpath Circuit.
Madame Rini.

1466
01:37:56,537 --> 01:37:59,456
That's her stage name.
Actually she's from Moline.

1467
01:37:59,623 --> 01:38:01,625
- Lida Rose Quackenbush.
- Can I see that?

1468
01:38:01,792 --> 01:38:03,752
You never forget the name.
Lida Rose.

1469
01:38:03,961 --> 01:38:06,422
- Just like in the old song.
- None of that now!

1470
01:38:07,965 --> 01:38:09,133
Lida Rose

1471
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:11,302
I'm home again, Rose

1472
01:38:12,052 --> 01:38:13,971
To get the

1473
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:16,807
Sun back

1474
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:21,395
In the sky

1475
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:23,981
Lida Rose

1476
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:28,527
I'm home again, Rose

1477
01:38:28,944 --> 01:38:34,783
About a thousand kisses shy

1478
01:38:35,284 --> 01:38:36,493
Ding

1479
01:38:36,702 --> 01:38:38,162
Dong

1480
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:39,955
Ding

1481
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:45,753
I can hear the chapel bell chime

1482
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:47,338
Ding

1483
01:38:47,546 --> 01:38:48,881
Dong

1484
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:51,008
Ding

1485
01:38:51,175 --> 01:38:55,804
At the least suggestion

1486
01:38:56,347 --> 01:39:01,518
I'll pop the question

1487
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:04,063
Lida Rose

1488
01:39:04,271 --> 01:39:07,316
I'm home again, Rose

1489
01:39:08,150 --> 01:39:13,030
Without a sweetheart to my name

1490
01:39:13,364 --> 01:39:15,741
Lida Rose

1491
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:20,079
How everyone knows

1492
01:39:20,663 --> 01:39:26,460
That I am hoping you're the same

1493
01:39:27,711 --> 01:39:34,218
So here is my love song

1494
01:39:34,843 --> 01:39:39,890
Not fancy or fine

1495
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:42,226
Lida Rose

1496
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:47,481
Oh, won't you be mine?

1497
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:53,779
Lida Rose, oh, Lida Rose
Oh, Lida Rose

1498
01:39:56,865 --> 01:40:00,744
Dream of now

1499
01:40:00,911 --> 01:40:04,748
Dream of then

1500
01:40:04,999 --> 01:40:09,545
Dream of a love song

1501
01:40:09,712 --> 01:40:12,339
That might have been

1502
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:15,926
Do I love you?

1503
01:40:16,093 --> 01:40:19,930
Oh, yes, I love you

1504
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:24,143
And I'll bravely tell you

1505
01:40:24,476 --> 01:40:29,273
But only when you dream again

1506
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:34,028
Sweet and low

1507
01:40:34,194 --> 01:40:38,115
Sweet and low

1508
01:40:38,532 --> 01:40:42,911
How sweet that memory

1509
01:40:43,078 --> 01:40:46,415
How long ago?

1510
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:49,334
Forever?

1511
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:53,464
Oh, yes, forever

1512
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:57,968
Will I ever tell you?

1513
01:40:58,552 --> 01:40:59,595
No

1514
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:03,265
Lida Rose, oh, Lida Rose, oh

1515
01:41:03,974 --> 01:41:06,643
Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose

1516
01:41:06,894 --> 01:41:11,148
To get the sun back in the sky

1517
01:41:12,232 --> 01:41:14,902
Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose

1518
01:41:15,277 --> 01:41:19,615
About a thousand kisses shy

1519
01:41:19,865 --> 01:41:20,908
Ding

1520
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:22,117
Dong

1521
01:41:22,284 --> 01:41:23,327
Ding

1522
01:41:23,827 --> 01:41:27,498
I can hear the chapel bell chime

1523
01:41:28,165 --> 01:41:29,208
Ding

1524
01:41:29,374 --> 01:41:30,417
Dong

1525
01:41:30,584 --> 01:41:31,668
Ding

1526
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:34,630
At the least suggestion

1527
01:41:34,838 --> 01:41:36,840
I'll pop the question

1528
01:41:37,341 --> 01:41:40,094
Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose

1529
01:41:40,302 --> 01:41:45,015
Without a sweetheart to my name

1530
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:48,268
Lida Rose, how everyone knows

1531
01:41:48,477 --> 01:41:53,482
That I am hoping you're the same

1532
01:41:54,024 --> 01:41:58,070
So here is my love song

1533
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:02,908
Not fancy or fine

1534
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:08,205
Lida Rose, oh, won't you be mine?

1535
01:42:08,372 --> 01:42:15,379
Lida Rose, oh, Lida Rose
Oh, Lida Rose

1536
01:42:28,267 --> 01:42:30,310
Will you ever stop arguing
with yourself?

1537
01:42:30,519 --> 01:42:34,231
Will you ever tell him?
Won't you ever tell him? Yes! No!

1538
01:42:34,439 --> 01:42:37,359
Fiddlesticks! Open your mouth
and let it come out.

1539
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,944
- Now, Mama-
- Now, nothing.

1540
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:41,697
If he ever calls again,
you see him alone...

1541
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:44,741
...and if you haven't the gumption
to tell him how you feel-

1542
01:42:44,908 --> 01:42:48,745
Tell him?
- Nothing wrong with a ladylike hint.

1543
01:42:49,163 --> 01:42:51,415
Ah! What's that thing you got?

1544
01:42:51,623 --> 01:42:55,169
It's a genuine Hercules
combination pocketknife and tool kit...

1545
01:42:55,377 --> 01:42:58,589
...with a solid stag handle
and six sturdy steel blades.

1546
01:42:58,755 --> 01:43:00,716
Blessed Martin of Tours!

1547
01:43:01,091 --> 01:43:04,469
One spear blade, one sheep's foot blade,
one small pen blade...

1548
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:08,891
...a swagging awl, a file and
a combination tack puller and screwdriver.

1549
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:11,476
Where'd you pick up
that horrible weapon?

1550
01:43:11,685 --> 01:43:13,145
It was a present.

1551
01:43:13,353 --> 01:43:14,396
From Harold.

1552
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:16,690
- Professor Hill?
- Uh-huh.

1553
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:19,026
He says if I stick around River City...

1554
01:43:19,234 --> 01:43:21,195
...I better learn to whittle and spit.

1555
01:43:21,403 --> 01:43:23,405
I got the spitting down pretty good.

1556
01:43:23,947 --> 01:43:28,243
Winthrop, what do you and Harold
find to talk about?

1557
01:43:28,619 --> 01:43:32,456
Sometimes we talk business
and sometimes just plain talk.

1558
01:43:32,623 --> 01:43:35,083
He talks about his hometown,
Gary, Indiana.

1559
01:43:35,292 --> 01:43:37,294
He said he'd take me there someday.

1560
01:43:37,669 --> 01:43:39,379
Isn't that nice?

1561
01:43:39,796 --> 01:43:43,300
He taught me a song about it
with hardly any "S"s in it.

1562
01:43:44,134 --> 01:43:45,636
Gary, Indiana

1563
01:43:45,802 --> 01:43:47,304
Gary, Indiana

1564
01:43:47,512 --> 01:43:48,722
Gary, Indiana

1565
01:43:48,931 --> 01:43:51,850
Let me say it once again

1566
01:43:52,684 --> 01:43:54,186
Gary, Indiana

1567
01:43:54,394 --> 01:43:55,896
Gary, Indiana

1568
01:43:56,104 --> 01:43:57,272
Gary, Indiana

1569
01:43:57,481 --> 01:44:00,234
That's the town that knew me when

1570
01:44:00,484 --> 01:44:04,321
If you'd like to have
A logical explanation

1571
01:44:04,947 --> 01:44:08,700
How I happened on this
Elegant syncopation

1572
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:12,829
I will say without
A moment of hesitation

1573
01:44:13,455 --> 01:44:15,499
There is just one place

1574
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:17,459
That can light my face

1575
01:44:18,418 --> 01:44:19,920
Gary, Indiana

1576
01:44:20,128 --> 01:44:21,421
Gary, Indiana

1577
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:22,965
Not Louisiana

1578
01:44:23,173 --> 01:44:26,093
Paris, France
New York or Rome

1579
01:44:26,593 --> 01:44:28,470
- But-
- Gary, Indiana

1580
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:30,097
Gary, Indiana

1581
01:44:30,305 --> 01:44:32,099
Gary, Indiana

1582
01:44:32,307 --> 01:44:34,977
My home sweet home

1583
01:44:42,734 --> 01:44:45,237
All right, enough of that.
Come along, now.

1584
01:44:45,445 --> 01:44:47,531
You still have to change
for the sociable.

1585
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:04,589
Do the Shinns live
around here somewhere?

1586
01:45:05,507 --> 01:45:07,634
The Shinn home is on East Elm.
This is West Elm.

1587
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:10,053
Mm, criminy.

1588
01:45:11,471 --> 01:45:13,557
Oh. I see you're the
piano teacher here in town.

1589
01:45:14,891 --> 01:45:18,103
You must know about this fellow Hill
forming a boys' band here.

1590
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:23,066
Don't let that worry you no more.
I got the goods on him in spades.

1591
01:45:23,275 --> 01:45:25,736
That swindling, two-bit
thimblerigger!

1592
01:45:25,902 --> 01:45:28,405
That's why I got to see Shinn.
I'm just passing through...

1593
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:31,491
...and number 8 only makes
a 15-minute water stop and-

1594
01:45:33,076 --> 01:45:34,745
Ooh.

1595
01:45:35,245 --> 01:45:37,164
I wish it was 20.

1596
01:45:37,539 --> 01:45:42,419
Sure could concentrate five minutes
on you, girlie-girl.

1597
01:45:43,045 --> 01:45:44,087
Who are you?

1598
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:47,507
Name's Charlie Cowell.
Anvil salesman.

1599
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:52,763
But now I've got heavier things
on my mind.

1600
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:57,726
I've got to protect the good name
of the traveling fraternity from Hill.

1601
01:45:58,518 --> 01:46:01,730
Mr. Cowell,
you're making a big mistake.

1602
01:46:01,938 --> 01:46:04,608
Mistake, my old lady's corset cover!

1603
01:46:04,816 --> 01:46:06,610
He's been the raspberry seed...

1604
01:46:06,818 --> 01:46:09,946
...in my wisdom tooth just long enough.

1605
01:46:10,113 --> 01:46:12,699
He spoiled Illinois for me.
But he won't spoil lowa.

1606
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:15,660
You're a music teacher.
You didn't see through him?

1607
01:46:15,869 --> 01:46:18,538
- He's no more professor-
- I know all about that.

1608
01:46:18,747 --> 01:46:21,208
Bandleaders are always called professor.

1609
01:46:21,416 --> 01:46:24,669
It's an academic courtesy.
He's a fine director-

1610
01:46:24,878 --> 01:46:28,131
Now wait a minute!

1611
01:46:28,298 --> 01:46:29,758
Fine director?

1612
01:46:29,966 --> 01:46:32,594
Tell me, you heard one note
of music from any band?

1613
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:35,639
Well, no, but-

1614
01:46:35,806 --> 01:46:40,143
But nothing, girlie-girl.
He never formed a band in his life.

1615
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:42,312
And you think he ever will?

1616
01:46:42,521 --> 01:46:44,356
Not on your previous existence!

1617
01:46:44,564 --> 01:46:45,941
Just listen a minute-

1618
01:46:46,149 --> 01:46:47,776
I'd like to.

1619
01:46:50,153 --> 01:46:53,115
I'd like to do more than that
if I had the time.

1620
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:55,367
Sure got the inclination.

1621
01:46:57,077 --> 01:47:01,456
But I got to leave this dynamite
with somebody on the way to the depot.

1622
01:47:02,374 --> 01:47:05,502
Bye, girlie-girl. I'll see you
next time I come through.

1623
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:11,133
You'll never make that train
at the depot. Catch it at the crossing.

1624
01:47:11,341 --> 01:47:16,179
I've got to leave word, and I can see
you ain't the one to leave it with.

1625
01:47:16,346 --> 01:47:17,848
Wait a minute!

1626
01:47:18,014 --> 01:47:19,474
Mr. Cowell.

1627
01:47:25,105 --> 01:47:28,024
You don't know me very well yet.

1628
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:33,572
Is that an invitation, girlie-girl?

1629
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:37,200
No. I mean, I don't know you.

1630
01:47:37,367 --> 01:47:39,703
I'd need more time anyway.

1631
01:47:39,911 --> 01:47:41,955
What I mean is...

1632
01:47:42,164 --> 01:47:45,709
...as well as I'd like to.

1633
01:47:47,377 --> 01:47:50,172
Oh. There's no trouble there...

1634
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:52,090
...girlie-girl!

1635
01:47:53,758 --> 01:47:56,219
I've never met a man...

1636
01:47:56,386 --> 01:47:58,513
...who sells anvils before.

1637
01:47:59,556 --> 01:48:01,391
It's really quite...

1638
01:48:02,267 --> 01:48:03,894
...different.

1639
01:48:06,354 --> 01:48:09,399
Takes a real salesman,
I can tell you that.

1640
01:48:09,608 --> 01:48:12,319
Anvils have a limited appeal, you know.

1641
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:20,452
What am I doing?

1642
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:22,913
If I miss that train, I'll lose my job.

1643
01:48:23,121 --> 01:48:25,081
And I got to leave word about Hill.

1644
01:48:26,082 --> 01:48:27,167
Leave word with me.

1645
01:48:27,375 --> 01:48:31,463
Not on your tintype, girlie-girl.

1646
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:34,216
How do I know
you'll deliver these letters?

1647
01:48:34,382 --> 01:48:35,800
Try me.

1648
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:49,606
There's your train! Run for it!

1649
01:48:49,814 --> 01:48:53,777
You double-dealing-
Who do you think you're protecting?

1650
01:48:54,361 --> 01:48:57,280
That guy's got a gal
in every county in Illinois...

1651
01:48:57,489 --> 01:49:01,451
...and he's taken it away from
every one of them. That's 102 counties!

1652
01:49:03,036 --> 01:49:07,582
Not counting the piano teachers
like you he cozies up to...

1653
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:10,126
...just to keep your mouths shut!

1654
01:49:10,502 --> 01:49:13,630
Neither one of you have
heard the last of me, girlie-girl!

1655
01:49:15,757 --> 01:49:18,093
I'll pop the question

1656
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:21,137
Lida Rose, I'm home again, Rose

1657
01:49:21,304 --> 01:49:25,642
Without a sweetheart to my name

1658
01:49:26,601 --> 01:49:31,648
Good evening, Miss Marian

1659
01:49:36,528 --> 01:49:39,322
Lida Rose, how everyone knows

1660
01:49:39,489 --> 01:49:42,701
That I am hoping you're the same

1661
01:49:42,867 --> 01:49:45,078
Marian!

1662
01:49:47,622 --> 01:49:50,208
Marian dear, who was you talking-?

1663
01:49:50,375 --> 01:49:51,918
Why, Professor Hill!

1664
01:49:52,085 --> 01:49:54,838
Mrs. Paroo, the top of the evening!
Miss Marian.

1665
01:49:55,005 --> 01:49:57,507
You and Marian come up and set.

1666
01:49:57,674 --> 01:49:59,676
I've got some jelly on the stove.

1667
01:49:59,843 --> 01:50:01,720
There's no jelly on the stove.

1668
01:50:01,928 --> 01:50:04,180
Well, I'll put some on!

1669
01:50:08,226 --> 01:50:12,272
- Shall we "set," as your mother said?
- Really, I don't-

1670
01:50:12,522 --> 01:50:15,066
You did ask me to call. Remember?

1671
01:50:15,233 --> 01:50:17,736
Did I? I didn't mean anything.

1672
01:50:17,944 --> 01:50:20,822
I'm not suggesting
your invitation inferred...

1673
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:23,533
...anything but academic enlightenment.

1674
01:50:25,702 --> 01:50:27,120
The Think System.

1675
01:50:28,204 --> 01:50:30,457
I've been by your house
to explain it to you...

1676
01:50:30,665 --> 01:50:33,251
...but there always seem
to be people around.

1677
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:35,462
Ladies mostly, I thought.

1678
01:50:35,712 --> 01:50:38,882
Yes. Mrs. Squires
and several of the other ladies.

1679
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:40,425
I'm glad.

1680
01:50:40,925 --> 01:50:43,303
I wouldn't want anyone beating my time.

1681
01:50:46,806 --> 01:50:48,183
"You wouldn't?"

1682
01:50:49,976 --> 01:50:51,227
"No, ma'am."

1683
01:50:53,605 --> 01:50:56,274
It's evidently not
the convenient evening.

1684
01:50:56,816 --> 01:50:58,360
I'll see you at the sociable.

1685
01:50:58,568 --> 01:51:01,488
Professor Hill, is it true
that you've had 100-?

1686
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:05,241
- What I'm trying to say is-
- Yes?

1687
01:51:05,825 --> 01:51:07,661
I was wondering...

1688
01:51:09,162 --> 01:51:12,916
...how you developed the Think System.

1689
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:14,584
The Think System?

1690
01:51:15,251 --> 01:51:16,670
Oh, the Think System!

1691
01:51:16,878 --> 01:51:20,757
It's quite simple, really.
It's as simple as whistling.

1692
01:51:20,965 --> 01:51:24,135
No one had to develop an
elaborate technique for whistling.

1693
01:51:24,344 --> 01:51:26,471
You simply think the tune up here...

1694
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,973
...and it comes out clearly here.

1695
01:51:32,602 --> 01:51:35,105
Now just suppose you try this yourself.

1696
01:51:36,481 --> 01:51:37,899
I'll take your word for it.

1697
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:41,528
Why don't we all sit down?

1698
01:51:42,362 --> 01:51:45,615
Are all music teachers
as dense as I am?

1699
01:51:46,991 --> 01:51:48,410
All music teachers?

1700
01:51:49,494 --> 01:51:53,206
I daresay you've met dozens.
Maybe even a hundred.

1701
01:51:53,873 --> 01:51:57,377
- Well-
- Are they all as fascinated as I...

1702
01:51:59,629 --> 01:52:01,506
...with the Think System?

1703
01:52:01,965 --> 01:52:03,675
Some more and some less.

1704
01:52:03,883 --> 01:52:06,970
One young lady had thought
up the same system.

1705
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:08,805
She showed me a few refinements.

1706
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,391
I see.

1707
01:52:11,808 --> 01:52:13,643
Have I said something wrong?

1708
01:52:14,644 --> 01:52:17,021
Please don't let me keep you.

1709
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:19,482
You must have more important
things to do...

1710
01:52:19,649 --> 01:52:22,026
...than explain the Think System to me.

1711
01:52:22,235 --> 01:52:24,279
Nope, can't think of one.
Come, let's sit.

1712
01:52:24,487 --> 01:52:27,949
I must be very dull company
for a man of your experience.

1713
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:31,077
Now where'd you ever get
an idea like that? Heh-heh.

1714
01:52:31,536 --> 01:52:34,038
One hears rumors about
traveling salesmen.

1715
01:52:34,247 --> 01:52:37,333
Oh, now, you mustn't
believe everything you hear.

1716
01:52:37,542 --> 01:52:41,337
After all, one even hears rumors
about librarians.

1717
01:52:42,797 --> 01:52:45,133
I presume you're referring
to Uncle Maddy?

1718
01:52:46,176 --> 01:52:50,054
- Uncle Maddy?
- Mr. Madison, my father's best friend.

1719
01:52:50,263 --> 01:52:53,475
No matter what they say,
he left that library job to me...

1720
01:52:53,683 --> 01:52:56,311
...so Mother, Winthrop and I
could have security.

1721
01:52:56,519 --> 01:52:58,271
Surely, you don't believe-

1722
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:00,857
No, but that's just what I'm saying.

1723
01:53:01,065 --> 01:53:03,276
Why do you suppose
people start rumors?

1724
01:53:03,693 --> 01:53:05,278
Narrow-mindedness, jealousy.

1725
01:53:05,695 --> 01:53:07,113
Jealousy mostly, I guess.

1726
01:53:07,322 --> 01:53:08,364
Exactly!

1727
01:53:08,573 --> 01:53:11,868
And jealousy mostly starts
rumors about traveling salesmen.

1728
01:53:25,673 --> 01:53:27,342
What have you heard?

1729
01:53:28,384 --> 01:53:29,469
Oh.

1730
01:53:29,636 --> 01:53:32,180
Nothing about you personally.
It's just...

1731
01:53:32,388 --> 01:53:34,641
...you know, generally.

1732
01:53:36,267 --> 01:53:38,895
What have you heard generally?

1733
01:53:40,063 --> 01:53:41,523
Just that-

1734
01:53:43,024 --> 01:53:45,068
But of course!

1735
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:50,740
It stands to reason that disappointment
and jealousy can lead to-

1736
01:53:50,949 --> 01:53:55,245
Well, take you, for instance.
Your attentions to customers...

1737
01:53:55,411 --> 01:53:58,414
...and teachers might easily be
misconstrued, mightn't they?

1738
01:53:58,915 --> 01:54:01,584
I mean now, honestly, mightn't they?

1739
01:54:01,751 --> 01:54:05,255
And as you say, if a salesman
or somebody were jealous...

1740
01:54:05,463 --> 01:54:08,591
...they could be downright lies,
now, couldn't they?

1741
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:11,427
- What could?
- Rumors and things!

1742
01:54:11,594 --> 01:54:12,804
Of course!

1743
01:54:13,012 --> 01:54:16,391
It goes to show, you should never
believe everything you hear!

1744
01:54:16,599 --> 01:54:19,811
I mean, if you just discuss things!

1745
01:54:20,019 --> 01:54:21,938
I'd be delighted to discuss...

1746
01:54:22,105 --> 01:54:25,108
...anything in the world with you.

1747
01:54:26,192 --> 01:54:28,236
But couldn't we do it sitting down?

1748
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:30,780
You do sit?

1749
01:54:31,239 --> 01:54:33,741
Your knees bend and all?

1750
01:54:35,034 --> 01:54:38,246
We could sit on the steps, I suppose.

1751
01:54:38,454 --> 01:54:40,957
Or on the large hollow log
over at the footbridge.

1752
01:54:41,457 --> 01:54:43,918
No, I couldn't do that.

1753
01:54:45,086 --> 01:54:47,797
I've never been to the footbridge
with a man in my life.

1754
01:54:48,131 --> 01:54:49,465
Just to talk.

1755
01:54:51,301 --> 01:54:53,803
I have to dress for the sociable.

1756
01:54:57,640 --> 01:54:59,976
Then meet me there in 15 minutes.

1757
01:55:00,894 --> 01:55:02,729
No, I can't.

1758
01:55:02,937 --> 01:55:04,439
Please.

1759
01:55:04,981 --> 01:55:07,901
Some other time.
Maybe tomorrow.

1760
01:55:08,985 --> 01:55:10,445
Please.

1761
01:55:11,946 --> 01:55:15,283
Oh, my dear little librarian!

1762
01:55:15,658 --> 01:55:18,369
You pile up enough tomorrows
and you'll collect...

1763
01:55:18,578 --> 01:55:21,915
...nothing but a lot
of empty yesterdays.

1764
01:55:23,875 --> 01:55:25,752
I don't know about you...

1765
01:55:26,669 --> 01:55:29,464
...but I'd like to make today
worth remembering.

1766
01:55:31,507 --> 01:55:33,760
Oh...

1767
01:55:34,677 --> 01:55:36,304
So would I.

1768
01:55:40,266 --> 01:55:41,976
The footbridge...

1769
01:55:42,185 --> 01:55:43,853
...15 minutes.

1770
01:55:53,821 --> 01:55:55,865
Fifteen minutes.

1771
01:56:13,049 --> 01:56:15,134
Mama!
- What?!

1772
01:56:15,802 --> 01:56:19,472
I told the professor I'd meet him
at the footbridge in 15 minutes.

1773
01:56:19,681 --> 01:56:21,641
Glory be and the saints be praised!

1774
01:56:21,808 --> 01:56:23,393
- It works!
- What works?

1775
01:56:23,559 --> 01:56:28,231
I been using the Think System
on you from the parlor.

1776
01:56:50,003 --> 01:56:52,839
Any of you people Mayor Shinn?

1777
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:19,407
Please, you got to clear this area.

1778
01:57:19,615 --> 01:57:22,076
Mrs. Shinn wants
to start the entertainment.

1779
01:57:23,619 --> 01:57:25,038
No, we want to dance.

1780
01:57:26,456 --> 01:57:29,125
Wait'll you see the new steps
Professor Hill taught us.

1781
01:57:29,292 --> 01:57:32,462
Mr. Washburn,
my group is ready to perform.

1782
01:57:34,630 --> 01:57:36,924
- Start her out.
- Okay, what'll it be?

1783
01:57:37,133 --> 01:57:38,301
"The Shipoopi!"

1784
01:57:43,806 --> 01:57:45,266
Now a woman who'll kiss on the

1785
01:57:45,433 --> 01:57:47,185
Very first date is usually a hussy.

1786
01:57:47,393 --> 01:57:50,480
And a woman who'll kiss on the
Second time out is anything but fussy

1787
01:57:50,646 --> 01:57:52,523
But a woman who'll wait
Till the third time around

1788
01:57:52,732 --> 01:57:54,317
Head in the clouds
Feet on the ground

1789
01:57:54,484 --> 01:57:57,653
She's the girl he's glad he's found
She's his Shipoopi

1790
01:57:57,862 --> 01:58:00,281
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi

1791
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:02,158
The girl who's hard to get

1792
01:58:02,325 --> 01:58:04,535
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi

1793
01:58:04,827 --> 01:58:06,662
But you can win her yet

1794
01:58:06,871 --> 01:58:08,372
Walk her once
Just to raise the curtain

1795
01:58:08,581 --> 01:58:10,374
Walk around twice
And you make for certain

1796
01:58:10,583 --> 01:58:11,667
Once more in the flower garden

1797
01:58:11,834 --> 01:58:14,462
She will never get sore
If you beg her pardon

1798
01:58:15,505 --> 01:58:18,966
Do re mi fa so la si do
Si la so fa mi re do

1799
01:58:19,133 --> 01:58:20,510
Squeeze her once
When she isn't looking

1800
01:58:20,718 --> 01:58:22,678
If you get a squeeze back
That's fancy cooking

1801
01:58:22,887 --> 01:58:23,930
Once more for a pepper-upper

1802
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:26,557
She will never get sore
On her way to supper

1803
01:58:27,892 --> 01:58:30,812
Do re mi fa so la si do
Si do

1804
01:58:30,978 --> 01:58:34,524
Now little old Sal's a no-gal
As anyone could see

1805
01:58:34,857 --> 01:58:37,652
Look at her now, she's a go-gal
Who only goes for me

1806
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:39,904
Squeeze her once
When she isn't looking

1807
01:58:40,113 --> 01:58:41,864
If you get a squeeze back
That's fancy cooking

1808
01:58:42,031 --> 01:58:43,116
Once more for a pepper-upper

1809
01:58:43,324 --> 01:58:45,159
She will never get sore
On her way to supper

1810
01:58:45,326 --> 01:58:48,371
Do re mi fa so la si do
Si do

1811
01:58:48,538 --> 01:58:51,082
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi

1812
01:58:51,249 --> 01:58:52,750
The girl who's hard to get

1813
01:58:52,917 --> 01:58:55,461
Shipoopi, Shipoopi,
Shipoopi

1814
01:58:55,628 --> 01:58:57,505
But you can win her yet

1815
02:00:58,334 --> 02:01:00,753
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi

1816
02:01:00,962 --> 02:01:02,672
The girl who's hard to get

1817
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:05,883
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi
But you can win her yet

1818
02:01:06,092 --> 02:01:08,344
Hey, professor!
Show us some new steps!

1819
02:02:21,208 --> 02:02:23,586
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi

1820
02:02:23,753 --> 02:02:25,171
The girl who's hard to get

1821
02:02:25,379 --> 02:02:27,590
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi

1822
02:02:27,798 --> 02:02:29,592
But you can win her yet

1823
02:02:29,842 --> 02:02:34,930
You can win her yet

1824
02:02:37,600 --> 02:02:38,642
Shipoopi!

1825
02:02:49,695 --> 02:02:50,738
Professor Hill-

1826
02:02:50,905 --> 02:02:53,491
This is no place to talk.
You won't back down?

1827
02:02:53,699 --> 02:02:56,077
I'll come, but I promised
Mother and Winthrop...

1828
02:02:56,285 --> 02:03:00,122
...to have a plate of cream with them.
You go along, I'll meet you.

1829
02:03:01,123 --> 02:03:02,792
Fifteen minutes.

1830
02:03:05,044 --> 02:03:06,837
Fifteen minutes.

1831
02:03:18,307 --> 02:03:21,936
And now we arrive
at the high-water mark...

1832
02:03:22,144 --> 02:03:23,813
...of the evening's festivities.

1833
02:03:24,313 --> 02:03:27,483
The River City Ladies'
Eurhythmic Dance Group...

1834
02:03:27,691 --> 02:03:30,486
...under the leadership of my wife...

1835
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:34,490
...will give their interpretation of...

1836
02:03:34,657 --> 02:03:35,783
Psst.

1837
02:03:36,325 --> 02:03:38,869
Grecian urns!

1838
02:03:39,412 --> 02:03:41,997
Yes. Grecian urns.

1839
02:03:44,458 --> 02:03:45,751
Psst. Psst.

1840
02:04:09,358 --> 02:04:12,069
One Grecian urn.

1841
02:05:24,808 --> 02:05:26,977
Miss Marian, you're late.

1842
02:05:28,103 --> 02:05:31,899
- You said 15 minutes.
- Not that kind of late. I meant...

1843
02:05:32,107 --> 02:05:33,609
I'd say about...

1844
02:05:33,776 --> 02:05:35,319
...26 years late.

1845
02:05:35,528 --> 02:05:38,948
It took you all this time to get
to the footbridge with a fella.

1846
02:05:39,532 --> 02:05:42,451
If you want to know the truth,
it was almost longer.

1847
02:05:42,618 --> 02:05:44,537
- Oh?
- Halfway here...

1848
02:05:44,745 --> 02:05:46,789
...I nearly turned back.

1849
02:05:47,206 --> 02:05:50,209
I suppose I'm not
the first person to discover...

1850
02:05:50,417 --> 02:05:53,629
...a girl doesn't think clearly
under the spell of your salesmanship.

1851
02:05:55,130 --> 02:05:59,176
You surely don't think I've
been trying to sell you anything?

1852
02:05:59,385 --> 02:06:00,970
Oh, no.

1853
02:06:01,136 --> 02:06:04,306
You've given me something.
That's why I had to come.

1854
02:06:05,683 --> 02:06:07,393
- I don't recall giving you-
- Yes.

1855
02:06:08,143 --> 02:06:09,603
Something beautiful.

1856
02:06:09,812 --> 02:06:11,814
That's why I came.

1857
02:06:12,314 --> 02:06:13,649
And I'm so glad.

1858
02:06:15,025 --> 02:06:17,653
Please don't be afraid
I expect too much more.

1859
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:21,323
One can't expect
a traveling salesman to stay put.

1860
02:06:21,490 --> 02:06:24,827
There've been many ports of call
and there'll be many more.

1861
02:06:25,035 --> 02:06:28,747
Still, I can be grateful
for what you've left behind.

1862
02:06:28,956 --> 02:06:30,249
For me.

1863
02:06:31,625 --> 02:06:33,002
Marian-

1864
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:37,006
There were bells

1865
02:06:37,172 --> 02:06:39,008
On the hill

1866
02:06:39,717 --> 02:06:44,263
But I never heard them ringing

1867
02:06:45,389 --> 02:06:50,019
No, I never heard them at all

1868
02:06:50,561 --> 02:06:54,440
Till there was you

1869
02:06:56,358 --> 02:06:58,527
There were birds

1870
02:06:58,736 --> 02:07:00,446
In the sky

1871
02:07:01,196 --> 02:07:05,701
But I never saw them winging

1872
02:07:06,577 --> 02:07:10,706
No, I never saw them at all

1873
02:07:11,415 --> 02:07:15,210
Till there was you.

1874
02:07:16,545 --> 02:07:19,715
And there was music

1875
02:07:19,882 --> 02:07:26,430
And there were wonderful roses

1876
02:07:26,889 --> 02:07:28,974
They tell me

1877
02:07:29,350 --> 02:07:33,228
In sweet fragrant meadows

1878
02:07:33,395 --> 02:07:35,230
Of dawn

1879
02:07:35,564 --> 02:07:39,568
And dew

1880
02:07:40,319 --> 02:07:42,780
There was love

1881
02:07:42,988 --> 02:07:45,240
All around

1882
02:07:45,741 --> 02:07:50,954
But I never heard it singing

1883
02:07:51,705 --> 02:07:56,001
No, I never heard it at all

1884
02:07:56,585 --> 02:08:00,756
Till there was you

1885
02:08:21,026 --> 02:08:23,779
There was love

1886
02:08:23,946 --> 02:08:26,073
All around

1887
02:08:26,615 --> 02:08:33,205
But I never heard it singing

1888
02:08:33,956 --> 02:08:39,837
No, I never heard it at all

1889
02:08:40,421 --> 02:08:47,469
Till there was

1890
02:08:47,636 --> 02:08:51,640
You

1891
02:09:13,704 --> 02:09:15,080
Marian.

1892
02:09:16,832 --> 02:09:19,209
There's lots you don't know about me.

1893
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:23,046
I'm not asking.

1894
02:09:24,923 --> 02:09:26,341
Excuse me.

1895
02:09:27,176 --> 02:09:30,262
I'm expecting a telegram from Rudi Friml.

1896
02:09:30,471 --> 02:09:32,347
This could be it.

1897
02:09:37,561 --> 02:09:41,190
Who's the salesman? Looks like
she's selling and you're buying.

1898
02:09:41,398 --> 02:09:42,983
I have to keep her off balance.

1899
02:09:43,275 --> 02:09:46,528
She's as off balance as
a catboat in a hurricane.

1900
02:09:46,737 --> 02:09:48,781
It's just until those uniforms arrive.

1901
02:09:48,989 --> 02:09:51,283
They're here and the kids are in them.

1902
02:09:51,867 --> 02:09:55,329
Tommy passed out the uniforms
and collected most of the money.

1903
02:09:55,537 --> 02:09:59,458
Now he's pretending there's
a band practice at the lumberyard.

1904
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,378
- What time's the freight train go?
40 from the junction.

1905
02:10:03,587 --> 02:10:05,172
It isn't even 8: 30 yet.

1906
02:10:05,506 --> 02:10:07,674
You better cheese it now while you can!

1907
02:10:07,883 --> 02:10:10,511
I came up through the ranks
on this skirmish.

1908
02:10:10,719 --> 02:10:12,805
I won't resign without my commission.

1909
02:10:13,096 --> 02:10:14,848
Now go on, beat it!

1910
02:10:19,436 --> 02:10:22,564
Never a peaceful moment
in the music business.

1911
02:10:24,316 --> 02:10:25,526
Now where were we?

1912
02:10:26,902 --> 02:10:29,571
You were going to tell me
what I don't know about you.

1913
02:10:31,532 --> 02:10:33,367
Yeah.

1914
02:10:34,117 --> 02:10:36,411
But we don't have to go
into that right now.

1915
02:10:37,538 --> 02:10:39,331
Of course not.

1916
02:10:40,165 --> 02:10:42,417
We never have to go into that, Harold.

1917
02:10:43,544 --> 02:10:47,631
Madam Librarian, you are a lady
from the ground up.

1918
02:10:47,881 --> 02:10:51,260
The librarian hasn't felt much like
doing research lately.

1919
02:10:52,177 --> 02:10:54,805
But she did plenty of it
when you first came here.

1920
02:10:55,222 --> 02:10:56,682
Oh.

1921
02:10:56,849 --> 02:10:57,891
About what?

1922
02:10:58,350 --> 02:11:01,728
Oh. About Professor Harold Hill...

1923
02:11:01,937 --> 02:11:05,232
...Gary Conservatory of Music,
Gold Medal Class of '05.

1924
02:11:08,110 --> 02:11:09,152
Harold...

1925
02:11:09,319 --> 02:11:12,489
...there wasn't any
Gary Conservatory in '05.

1926
02:11:13,448 --> 02:11:14,908
Well, there most cert-

1927
02:11:15,075 --> 02:11:17,703
The town wasn't even built until '06.

1928
02:11:20,497 --> 02:11:21,748
Walk me home.

1929
02:11:21,957 --> 02:11:24,918
I have to get something
to draw around my shoulders.

1930
02:11:26,461 --> 02:11:27,838
You knew all the time.

1931
02:11:28,797 --> 02:11:31,758
I've known since
three days after you came here.

1932
02:11:34,678 --> 02:11:37,472
I tore this out of the Indiana Journal.

1933
02:11:37,681 --> 02:11:40,058
I meant to use it against you.

1934
02:11:40,767 --> 02:11:42,769
Now I give it to you with all my heart.

1935
02:11:45,522 --> 02:11:47,316
But if you knew-

1936
02:12:02,456 --> 02:12:05,876
It's your sweet "Hello, dear"

1937
02:12:06,043 --> 02:12:09,379
That sets me up

1938
02:12:09,838 --> 02:12:14,343
And it's your "Got to go, dear"

1939
02:12:14,509 --> 02:12:20,515
That gets me down

1940
02:12:22,517 --> 02:12:26,063
It's you on my pillow

1941
02:12:26,229 --> 02:12:29,858
In all of my dreams

1942
02:12:30,359 --> 02:12:33,153
Till once more the morning-

1943
02:12:33,362 --> 02:12:35,072
Stop! Stop!

1944
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:37,366
Stop! Stop, I tell you!

1945
02:12:37,574 --> 02:12:39,034
Listen to this man.

1946
02:12:39,242 --> 02:12:42,371
Why, you boneheaded, square-toed...

1947
02:12:42,579 --> 02:12:44,373
...tank town boobs!

1948
02:12:44,706 --> 02:12:46,166
I've been trying to tell you!

1949
02:12:46,375 --> 02:12:50,587
Can't you see this music fella's
giving you the double shuffle!

1950
02:12:50,796 --> 02:12:52,381
He's putting the shake on you...

1951
02:12:52,589 --> 02:12:56,176
...taking out your eyeteeth
while you look the other way.

1952
02:12:56,385 --> 02:12:57,636
What are you saying?

1953
02:12:57,970 --> 02:12:59,721
I'll tell you what I'm saying!

1954
02:12:59,888 --> 02:13:04,518
This burglar's in the bedroom
while you're fiddling in the parlor!

1955
02:13:05,227 --> 02:13:07,229
Whose bedroom are
the burglars fiddling in?

1956
02:13:07,396 --> 02:13:08,438
Quiet.

1957
02:13:08,647 --> 02:13:10,524
I'm talking about Harold Hill.

1958
02:13:10,732 --> 02:13:12,025
A shell worker.

1959
02:13:12,317 --> 02:13:13,485
A flimflammer!

1960
02:13:13,694 --> 02:13:15,737
An eighteen-karat thief!

1961
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:17,406
You mean the music professor?

1962
02:13:17,572 --> 02:13:19,408
Music professor?

1963
02:13:19,616 --> 02:13:22,411
Not on your fireless cooker, mister!

1964
02:13:22,577 --> 02:13:23,912
Fellow that organized the band?

1965
02:13:24,246 --> 02:13:26,832
There ain't any band.
There ain't never been a band.

1966
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:29,251
There ain't never going to be a band!

1967
02:13:29,418 --> 02:13:32,421
Unless you hunt this man down now
like a mad dog...

1968
02:13:32,587 --> 02:13:34,673
...there won't be a Harold Hill either.

1969
02:13:34,923 --> 02:13:36,842
He'll be on his way to the state line.

1970
02:13:37,050 --> 02:13:40,137
I said all along,
get his credentials, didn't I?

1971
02:13:40,345 --> 02:13:43,181
I got his credentials right here!

1972
02:13:43,432 --> 02:13:45,225
Well, what are we waiting for?

1973
02:13:45,726 --> 02:13:46,810
I want my money back.

1974
02:13:47,019 --> 02:13:48,061
I want his hide!

1975
02:13:48,437 --> 02:13:50,439
Find him and bring him to the school.

1976
02:13:50,605 --> 02:13:52,607
Roped and hogtied, if you have to.

1977
02:13:52,774 --> 02:13:54,568
And don't let him give you the slip.

1978
02:13:54,776 --> 02:13:56,278
All right, after him!

1979
02:14:48,538 --> 02:14:49,956
Have you seen Professor Hill?

1980
02:14:50,165 --> 02:14:52,417
Haven't been looking for him.

1981
02:14:56,296 --> 02:14:58,173
I'll only be a minute.

1982
02:15:07,474 --> 02:15:10,519
While 110 cornets played the air

1983
02:15:11,144 --> 02:15:13,355
Then I modestly took my place

1984
02:15:13,563 --> 02:15:15,232
As the one and only bass

1985
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:18,568
And I oompahed up and down the square

1986
02:15:19,861 --> 02:15:23,281
Good night, my someone

1987
02:15:23,824 --> 02:15:27,119
Good night, my love

1988
02:15:27,369 --> 02:15:30,664
With 110 cornets right behind

1989
02:15:32,249 --> 02:15:35,794
Our star is shining

1990
02:15:36,461 --> 02:15:40,382
Its brightest light

1991
02:15:40,715 --> 02:15:43,385
There were horns of every shape and-

1992
02:15:53,728 --> 02:15:57,858
Sweet dreams be yours, dear

1993
02:15:58,733 --> 02:16:02,571
If dreams there be

1994
02:16:02,904 --> 02:16:06,825
While 110 cornets played the air

1995
02:16:08,076 --> 02:16:11,371
I wish I may

1996
02:16:12,289 --> 02:16:16,459
And I wish I might

1997
02:16:18,879 --> 02:16:20,672
Now good night

1998
02:16:22,215 --> 02:16:23,842
My someone

1999
02:16:29,681 --> 02:16:31,057
Good night.

2000
02:16:48,033 --> 02:16:50,619
He's not in there.
Try the livery stable!

2001
02:16:51,786 --> 02:16:54,080
Try the freight depot!

2002
02:17:41,294 --> 02:17:42,337
Let's go, Greg.

2003
02:17:42,504 --> 02:17:44,965
The flivver's in the alley,
all cranked up!

2004
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:47,842
They're onto you!
That anvil salesman...

2005
02:17:48,009 --> 02:17:50,804
...is running all over town
spilling everything!

2006
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:53,014
Come on!

2007
02:17:55,267 --> 02:17:59,104
Run, professor!
They're talking about tar and feathers.

2008
02:17:59,312 --> 02:18:02,357
I've looked all over for Winthrop.
He's run away.

2009
02:18:02,565 --> 02:18:04,359
Maybe he's in his room.

2010
02:18:10,824 --> 02:18:12,909
It's not often I'm at a loss for words-

2011
02:18:13,118 --> 02:18:15,453
It's all right.
Don't you know that?

2012
02:18:15,662 --> 02:18:17,580
You don't owe me a word,
not a word.

2013
02:18:17,789 --> 02:18:19,749
Now hurry, please!

2014
02:18:21,710 --> 02:18:23,211
Greg!

2015
02:18:25,880 --> 02:18:27,382
He's not around here, folks!

2016
02:18:28,049 --> 02:18:29,634
Let's try by the creamery.

2017
02:18:35,473 --> 02:18:38,518
- Whoa. Hold on a minute, son.
- I'm not your son. Leave me go!

2018
02:18:38,685 --> 02:18:40,645
Not until I talk to you a minute.

2019
02:18:40,812 --> 02:18:43,189
I won't listen.
You wouldn't tell the truth anyway.

2020
02:18:43,356 --> 02:18:44,441
- I would too.
- Would not!

2021
02:18:44,607 --> 02:18:46,901
Tell you anything you want to know.

2022
02:18:47,986 --> 02:18:49,321
Can you lead a band?

2023
02:18:52,198 --> 02:18:53,241
No!

2024
02:18:54,576 --> 02:18:56,953
- Are you a big liar?
- Yes.

2025
02:18:57,412 --> 02:18:59,247
- Are you a dirty, rotten crook?
- Yes.

2026
02:18:59,414 --> 02:19:01,833
Then leave me go, you big liar!

2027
02:19:02,042 --> 02:19:04,252
You wanted the truth, didn't you?

2028
02:19:04,461 --> 02:19:06,504
I'm bigger than you,
and you're getting it all.

2029
02:19:06,713 --> 02:19:08,631
So just stop wiggling.

2030
02:19:09,758 --> 02:19:11,051
Now...

2031
02:19:11,217 --> 02:19:13,595
There are two things
you're entitled to know.

2032
02:19:13,803 --> 02:19:16,222
One, you're a wonderful kid.

2033
02:19:16,556 --> 02:19:19,517
I thought so from the first.
That's why I wanted you in the band...

2034
02:19:19,684 --> 02:19:22,771
...so you'd stop moping around
and feeling sorry for yourself.

2035
02:19:24,022 --> 02:19:25,815
What band?

2036
02:19:28,693 --> 02:19:30,528
I always think there's a band, kid.

2037
02:19:31,404 --> 02:19:33,448
What's the other thing
I'm entitled to know?

2038
02:19:36,618 --> 02:19:39,037
That's none of your business,
come to think of it.

2039
02:19:39,245 --> 02:19:41,581
I wish you never came to River City.

2040
02:19:44,125 --> 02:19:45,460
No, you don't, Winthrop.

2041
02:19:47,837 --> 02:19:50,048
Sister, you believe him?

2042
02:19:53,259 --> 02:19:55,345
I believe everything he ever said.

2043
02:19:57,055 --> 02:19:59,307
But he promised us!

2044
02:19:59,641 --> 02:20:03,812
I know what he promised us,
and it all happened just like he said:

2045
02:20:03,978 --> 02:20:07,107
The lights, the colors,
the cymbals and the flags.

2046
02:20:08,024 --> 02:20:09,359
Where was all that?

2047
02:20:10,151 --> 02:20:13,363
In the way every kid in town
walked around all summer...

2048
02:20:13,571 --> 02:20:15,240
...and looked and acted.

2049
02:20:15,448 --> 02:20:17,117
Especially you.

2050
02:20:17,325 --> 02:20:19,411
And the parents too.

2051
02:20:20,328 --> 02:20:22,247
Does Mama wish he'd never come?

2052
02:20:23,123 --> 02:20:25,041
Well, you do, don't you?

2053
02:20:27,043 --> 02:20:28,753
No, Winthrop.

2054
02:20:31,923 --> 02:20:34,050
You'd better go, Harold. Please!

2055
02:20:35,510 --> 02:20:37,470
Go on, professor.

2056
02:20:37,846 --> 02:20:39,264
Hurry up.

2057
02:20:40,140 --> 02:20:41,850
I can't go, Winthrop.

2058
02:20:43,351 --> 02:20:44,436
Why not?

2059
02:20:46,062 --> 02:20:48,356
Well, for the first time in my life...

2060
02:20:50,150 --> 02:20:52,360
...I got my foot caught in the door.

2061
02:20:59,284 --> 02:21:01,035
There was love

2062
02:21:02,328 --> 02:21:03,788
All around

2063
02:21:05,081 --> 02:21:09,377
But I never heard it singing

2064
02:21:10,879 --> 02:21:15,967
No, I never heard it at all

2065
02:21:21,181 --> 02:21:23,057
Till there was you.

2066
02:21:29,898 --> 02:21:31,399
Greg!

2067
02:21:32,108 --> 02:21:33,234
Greg, they're here!

2068
02:21:33,401 --> 02:21:34,652
Run this way!

2069
02:21:34,861 --> 02:21:37,030
Go on, professor! That way, that way!

2070
02:22:06,684 --> 02:22:10,146
And always remember,
fellow River City-zeeans...

2071
02:22:10,355 --> 02:22:12,941
...I did everything in my power
to prevent this dire...

2072
02:22:13,107 --> 02:22:14,859
...happening from...

2073
02:22:15,068 --> 02:22:16,110
...happening.

2074
02:22:16,778 --> 02:22:18,279
Fourscore-

2075
02:22:18,488 --> 02:22:19,822
How will you get our money back?

2076
02:22:20,031 --> 02:22:24,410
That professor collected almost
$300 on uniforms just tonight.

2077
02:22:25,161 --> 02:22:29,249
I haven't seen a uniform or my boy
either since just after supper.

2078
02:22:29,457 --> 02:22:30,917
He's a kidnapper!

2079
02:22:31,125 --> 02:22:33,002
That's a fine situation we have here!

2080
02:22:35,296 --> 02:22:37,507
Fourscore-

2081
02:22:43,137 --> 02:22:44,973
Just a minute!

2082
02:22:45,139 --> 02:22:47,559
Virtue has triumphed!

2083
02:22:48,643 --> 02:22:50,520
The sword of restibution...

2084
02:22:50,728 --> 02:22:52,272
...has cut down...

2085
02:22:52,480 --> 02:22:54,524
...Professor Harold Hill.

2086
02:23:02,991 --> 02:23:05,743
And if there are those,
as I've heard...

2087
02:23:05,952 --> 02:23:09,330
...who are melting tar
and plucking feathers...

2088
02:23:09,622 --> 02:23:11,958
...I will not say them nay!

2089
02:23:12,542 --> 02:23:16,713
I should think some of you could forget
your everlasting lowa stubbornness...

2090
02:23:16,879 --> 02:23:20,717
...long enough to remember what
this town was like before Harold Hill came.

2091
02:23:21,843 --> 02:23:23,219
Do you?

2092
02:23:23,386 --> 02:23:24,846
- Well, do you?
- Hold up, there!

2093
02:23:25,013 --> 02:23:26,556
And then after he came!

2094
02:23:27,348 --> 02:23:29,934
Suddenly there were things to do...

2095
02:23:30,143 --> 02:23:32,395
...and things to be proud of...

2096
02:23:32,604 --> 02:23:35,440
...and people to go
out of your way for.

2097
02:23:36,024 --> 02:23:40,695
Surely some of you can be grateful
for what this man has brought to us.

2098
02:23:41,195 --> 02:23:42,864
I'd think you'd want to admit it!

2099
02:23:43,072 --> 02:23:45,575
You're wasting a great deal of time!

2100
02:23:45,783 --> 02:23:47,535
If there's a person in this hall...

2101
02:23:47,702 --> 02:23:51,289
...who doesn't want this man
Hill tarred and feathered...

2102
02:23:51,497 --> 02:23:54,042
...let him, by God, stand up!

2103
02:24:31,746 --> 02:24:33,081
Eulalie, sit down!

2104
02:24:40,254 --> 02:24:44,759
And the rest of you, who are standing
there like Shropshire sheep!

2105
02:24:44,967 --> 02:24:47,053
Maybe you can remember other things.

2106
02:24:47,261 --> 02:24:49,138
Like what you paid for uniforms...

2107
02:24:49,514 --> 02:24:52,725
...technical instruction books
and band instruments.

2108
02:24:52,934 --> 02:24:54,435
With the understanding...

2109
02:24:54,602 --> 02:24:57,105
...your children would be taught
to play in a band!

2110
02:24:57,563 --> 02:25:00,274
Well, where's the band?

2111
02:25:00,483 --> 02:25:02,777
Where's the band?!

2112
02:25:13,413 --> 02:25:15,790
Oh...

2113
02:26:07,633 --> 02:26:09,343
No, I couldn't!

2114
02:26:25,526 --> 02:26:27,695
Now, think, men.

2115
02:26:29,572 --> 02:26:31,073
Think!

2116
02:26:48,174 --> 02:26:49,926
That's my Barney!

2117
02:26:50,134 --> 02:26:53,054
That tuba's my Barney!

2118
02:26:53,221 --> 02:26:54,305
Wonderful, Barney.

2119
02:26:54,472 --> 02:26:58,935
That's Eddie! That's Eddie's clarinet!
Oh. Oh.

2120
02:26:59,477 --> 02:27:00,895
Linus!

2121
02:27:01,646 --> 02:27:03,940
Play to me, son!

2122
02:27:04,273 --> 02:27:06,192
Play to me!

2123
02:27:07,235 --> 02:27:08,528
Davey!

2124
02:27:08,736 --> 02:27:10,571
That's my Davey!

2125
02:29:41,347 --> 02:29:42,723
Oh!

2126
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:04,829
76 trombones led the big parade

2127
02:30:04,996 --> 02:30:08,666
With 110 cornets close at hand

2128
02:30:09,083 --> 02:30:13,421
They were followed by rows and rows
Of the finest virtuosos

2129
02:30:13,587 --> 02:30:17,091
The cream of every famous band

2130
02:30:17,258 --> 02:30:20,761
76 trombones caught the morning sun

2131
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:25,057
With 110 cornets right behind

2132
02:30:25,224 --> 02:30:29,145
There were more than a thousand reeds
Springing up like weeds

2133
02:30:29,353 --> 02:30:33,107
There were horns
Of every shape and kind

2134
02:30:33,274 --> 02:30:37,445
There were copper-bottom timpani
In horse platoons

2135
02:30:37,778 --> 02:30:41,282
Thundering, thundering
All along the way

2136
02:30:41,782 --> 02:30:45,369
Double bell euphoniums
And big bassoons

2137
02:30:45,828 --> 02:30:47,079
Each bassoon

2138
02:30:47,288 --> 02:30:49,123
Having his big fat say

2139
02:30:49,331 --> 02:30:53,252
There were 50 mounted cannon
In the battery

2140
02:30:53,669 --> 02:30:57,465
Thundering, thundering
Louder than before

2141
02:30:57,882 --> 02:31:01,343
Clarinets of every size
And trumpeters who'd improvise

2142
02:31:01,552 --> 02:31:07,975
A full octave higher than the score!
