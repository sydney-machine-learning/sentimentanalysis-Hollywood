1
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,852
He was the most extraordinary
man I ever knew.

2
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,104
Did you know him well?

3
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:01,981
I knew him.

4
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,068
Well, <i>nil nisi bonum.</i>

5
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,279
But did he really deserve

6
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,739
a place in here?

7
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,591
Lord Allenby, could you give me a
few words about Colonel Lawrence?

8
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,801
What, more words?

9
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,555
The revolt in the desert

10
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:38,392
played a decisive part in
the Middle Eastern campaign.

11
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,395
Yes, sir, but about
Colonel Lawrence himself.

12
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,983
No, no. I didn't know
him well, you know.

13
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,281
Now, Mr. Bentley, you must know as much
about Colonel Lawrence as anybody does.

14
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,201
Yes, it was my privilege
to know him.

15
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,078
And to make him
known to the world.

16
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,541
He was a poet, a scholar
and a mighty warrior.

17
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,043
Thank you.

18
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:08,923
He was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.

19
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,050
You, sir. Who are you?

20
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,510
My name is
Jackson Bentley.

21
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,972
Well, whoever you are,
I overheard your last

22
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,932
remark, and I take the
gravest possible exception.

23
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,434
- He was a very great man.
- Did you know him?

24
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,728
No, I can't claim to
have known him.

25
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,397
I once had the honour to
shake his hand in Damascus.

26
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,274
Knew him? No,
I never knew him.

27
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,945
He had some minor function
on my staff in Cairo.

28
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,299
Michael George Hartley,

29
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,636
this is a nasty,
dark, little room.

30
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,137
That's right.

31
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,640
We are not
happy in it.

32
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:03,686
I am. It's better than
a nasty, dark, little trench.

33
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,106
- Then you're a big noble fellow.
- That's right.

34
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,528
Ah, here is William Potter
with my newspaper.

35
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,239
- Here you are, tosh.
- Thanks.

36
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,535
Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?

37
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,328
Ta.

38
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:24,248
- Is it there?
- Of course.

39
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,083
Headlines.

40
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,837
But I'll bet it isn't
mentioned in the <i>Times.</i>

41
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,842
"Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghold."

42
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,471
And I bet that no one in this whole
headquarters even knows it happened.

43
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:43,392
Or would care if it did. Allow
me to ignite your cigarette.

44
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,022
- Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes.

45
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,482
- Flimsy, sir.
- Thank you.

46
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,826
You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood.

47
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,871
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

48
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,914
And you're balmy!

49
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:19,887
Oh!

50
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:23,015
- It damn well hurts!
- Certainly, it hurts.

51
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,142
Well, what's
the trick, then?

52
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,396
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

53
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,608
Oh, by the way, if Captain
Gibbon should enquire for me,

54
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:36,153
tell him I've gone for
a chat with the general.

55
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,115
- He's balmy.
- He's all right.

56
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,539
Lawrence.

57
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,541
Yes?

58
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,585
You're supposed to be...

59
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,380
Do you usually wear
your cap in the mess?

60
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,340
Always.

61
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,717
You're supposed to be on duty, aren't you?
Where are you going?

62
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,428
Mustn't talk shop, Freddie,
not in the mess.

63
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,514
Matter of fact, I'm going for
a powwow with the general.

64
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:07,267
I'm not asking as your superior, Lawrence,
I'm asking as the secretary of this mess.

65
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,937
We don't want chaps in here
who should be on duty.

66
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,647
Where are you going,
please?

67
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,443
I must say,
Lawrence!

68
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,446
- Sorry.
- You're a clown, Lawrence.

69
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:23,075
Ah, well, we can't
all be lion tamers.

70
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,745
Sorry.

71
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,581
It's an intrigue, Dryden.

72
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,752
And I do not propose to let an
overweening, finicky, crass lieutenant

73
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,755
thumb his nose at his general officer
commanding and get away with it.

74
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,259
It doesn't sound as though
he'd be any great loss, sir.

75
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,887
Now don't try that, Dryden.
There's a principle involved.

76
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,639
There is, indeed.

77
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,808
He's of no use here in Cairo.

78
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,145
He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.

79
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:52,938
Knows the books, you mean.

80
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,275
I've already sent out
Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.

81
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:59,236
And if Brighton thinks we should send
them some small arms, then we will.

82
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,157
Well, what more do you want?

83
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,493
That there would be no question
of Lieutenant Lawrence

84
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,579
giving military advice.

85
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,747
By God, I should
hope not.

86
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:15,294
It's just that the Arab Bureau would
like its own man on the spot, sir, to...

87
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,795
To what?

88
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,506
To make our own appraisal
of the situation.

89
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:23,802
I may as well tell you, it's my
considered opinion and that of my staff

90
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,847
that any time spent on the
Bedouin will be time wasted.

91
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,433
They're a nation
of sheep-stealers.

92
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,561
They did attack Medina.

93
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,147
And the Turks made
mincemeat of them.

94
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,732
We don't know that, sir.

95
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:41,445
We know that they didn't take it. A
storm in a teacup, Dryden, a sideshow.

96
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:46,116
If you want my own opinion, this whole
theatre of operations is a sideshow.

97
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,745
The real war's being fought
against the Germans, not the Turks.

98
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,789
And not here, but on the
Western front in the trenches.

99
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,501
Your Bedouin Army,
or whatever it calls itself,

100
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,295
would be a sideshow
of a sideshow.

101
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,173
Big things have
small beginnings, sir.

102
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,594
Does the Arab Bureau
want a big thing in Arabia?

103
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,076
If they rise against the
Turks, does the bureau think

104
00:14:08,077 --> 00:14:10,307
they're going to sit down under
us when this war is over?

105
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:15,479
The bureau thinks the job of the
moment, sir, is to win the war.

106
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,398
Don't tell me my duty,
Mr. Dryden.

107
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,318
- Lawrence, sir.
- Send him in.

108
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,446
Good morning, sir.

109
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,114
Salute.

110
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,662
If you're insubordinate with me,
Lawrence, I shall put you under arrest.

111
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,664
- It's my manner, sir.
- Your what?

112
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,792
My manner, sir. It looks
insubordinate, but it isn't really.

113
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,004
I can't make out whether you're bloody
bad-mannered or just half-witted.

114
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,258
- I have the same problem, sir.
- Shut up.

115
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,886
The Arab Bureau seem to think you would
be of some use to them in Arabia.

116
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,805
Why, I can't imagine.

117
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,474
You don't seem able to perform
your present duties properly.

118
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:57,646
"I cannot fiddle, but I can make
a great state from a little city."

119
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,023
- What?
- Themistocles, sir.

120
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,567
A Greek philosopher.

121
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,860
I know you've been
well-educated, Lawrence.

122
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,363
It says so in your dossier.

123
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,743
You're the kind of creature
I can't stand, Lawrence.

124
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,164
But I suppose I could be wrong.

125
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,585
All right, Dryden. You can
have him for six weeks.

126
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,753
Who knows? It might even
make a man of him.

127
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,255
Come in!

128
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,592
Yes, what is it?

129
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,553
Navy signal, sir. The convoy will
be in Port Said tomorrow night.

130
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,805
- Is that certain?
- Yes, sir.

131
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,058
There doesn't seem
to be any artillery, sir.

132
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,061
But there must be artillery!

133
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,359
Sir, this is something
of an expedition.

134
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:48,780
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,
find the Arabs and then get back.

135
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,617
He can't do that
in six weeks.

136
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,953
- Two months, then.
- Three.

137
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:59,541
All right, three. Now, will you
let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?

138
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,418
Thank you, sir.

139
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,257
I'd like to say, sir,
that I am grateful for this.

140
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,384
Shut up and get out.

141
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,850
Sir?

142
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,734
How can I fight a bloody war
without bloody artillery?

143
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,944
How did you do it?

144
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,656
You might better ask
why I bothered to.

145
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,409
- Because I'm the man for the job.
- I just wonder about that.

146
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,537
Of course I'm the man for job.
What is the job, by the way?

147
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,498
Find Prince Feisal.

148
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,583
Good. And when
I've found him?

149
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,837
Find out what
kind of man he is.

150
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,841
Find out what his intentions are. I
don't mean his immediate intentions.

151
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,552
That is Colonel Brighton's
business, not yours.

152
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:57,099
I mean, his intentions
in Arabia altogether.

153
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,143
Oh.

154
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,895
That's new.

155
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,856
Where are they now?

156
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,984
Anywhere within 300
miles of Medina.

157
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,653
They're Hashemite Bedouins.

158
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:13,573
They can cross 60 miles
of desert in a day.

159
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,784
Oh, thanks, Dryden.
This is going to be fun.

160
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:20,247
Lawrence, only two kinds of
creature get fun in the desert:

161
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:24,000
Bedouins and gods, and you're neither.
Take it from me.

162
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:27,546
For ordinary men,
it's a burning, fiery furnace.

163
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:31,508
No, Dryden.
It's going to be fun.

164
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,640
It is recognised that you
have a funny sense of fun.

165
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,384
Here you may drink.

166
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:01,389
One cup.

167
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,774
You do not drink?

168
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,442
No.

169
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,570
I'll drink when you do.

170
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,572
I am Bedu.

171
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:22,197
Truly, now, you are
a British officer?

172
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,823
Yes.

173
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,117
From Cairo?

174
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,994
Yes.

175
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,748
- You did not ride from Cairo?
- No.

176
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,919
Thank heaven. It's 900
miles. I came by boat.

177
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,004
And before?

178
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,132
From Britain?

179
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,801
Yes.

180
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,512
Truly?

181
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,430
From Oxfordshire.

182
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,934
Is that a desert country?

183
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:56,272
No. A fat country. Fat people.

184
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,067
You are not fat?

185
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,944
No.

186
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,072
I'm different.

187
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,476
Here...

188
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,770
take it.

189
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:40,066
First I take you to Lord Feisal,
then you give it to me.

190
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,818
Take it now.

191
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,047
Bedu food.

192
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,688
Good.

193
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,190
More?

194
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,282
- Bedu.
- Where?

195
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,848
From here to Lord Feisal's
camp is Harith country.

196
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,349
Yes, I know.

197
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,434
- I am not Harith.
- No.

198
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:41,312
Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.

199
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,731
Ah...

200
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,977
Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your left foot.

201
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,812
Then, when you are
ready to go,

202
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,607
hit her on the shoulder
and say, "Hut-hut-hut."

203
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,984
Hut-hut-hut!

204
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,038
Ah.

205
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,462
Today will be difficult,
but tomorrow, good riding.

206
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:08,066
I think we reach Masturah
Well tomorrow. Yes.

207
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:11,778
And from Masturah Well to Lord
Feisal's camp, one day more.

208
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:13,279
Now!

209
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,590
Good?

210
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,676
It's all right.

211
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,013
This is a Harith well.

212
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,932
The Harith are a dirty people.

213
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,932
Turks?

214
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,543
Bedu.

215
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,841
Who is he?

216
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:13,895
Tafas!

217
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,104
He is dead.

218
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,981
Yes.

219
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,359
Why?

220
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:05,655
This is my well.

221
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,908
I have drunk from it.

222
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,619
You are welcome.

223
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,664
He was my friend.

224
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,750
- That?
- Yes, that.

225
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:31,097
- This pistol yours?
- No, his.

226
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:49,031
His?

227
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:50,908
Mine.

228
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:53,411
Then I will use it.

229
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:03,546
Your friend...

230
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,800
was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.

231
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,468
I know.

232
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,311
I am Ali ibn el Kharish.

233
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:21,939
I have heard of you.

234
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,318
So...

235
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,530
what was a Hazimi
doing here?

236
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,242
He was taking me
to help Prince Feisal.

237
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:37,204
- You have been sent from Cairo.
- Yes.

238
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:41,167
I have been in Cairo
for my schooling.

239
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,503
I can both read and write.

240
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,968
My Lord Feisal already
has an Englishman.

241
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:54,305
- Yes.
- What is your name?

242
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,850
My name is for my friends.

243
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:05,399
None of my friends
is a murderer.

244
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,362
You are angry, English.

245
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,955
He was nothing.

246
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,041
The well is everything.

247
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:26,003
The Hazimi may
not drink at our wells.

248
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,880
He knew that.

249
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:32,802
<i>Salaam.</i>
Hut-hut-hut.

250
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,637
Sherif Ali.

251
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,099
So long as the Arabs fight
tribe against tribe,

252
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,851
so long will they be
a little people,

253
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:42,478
a silly people.

254
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:47,191
Greedy, barbarous
and cruel, as you are.

255
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,373
Come.

256
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,042
I will take you to Feisal.

257
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,294
I do not want your
company, sherif.

258
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,840
Wadi Safra is another
day from here.

259
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,218
You will not find it, and not
finding it, you will die.

260
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,347
I will find it with this.

261
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,983
Good army compass.

262
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,485
How if I take it?

263
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:33,195
Then you would be a thief.

264
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:35,740
Have you no fear, English?

265
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,201
My fear is my concern.

266
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,078
Truly.

267
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,126

- I've been waiting for you.
- Did you know I was coming?

277
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:52,209
I knew someone was
coming. Feisal told me.

278
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,836
How did he know?

279
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:56,964
Not much happens within 50 miles of
Feisal that Feisal doesn't know.

280
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,300
I'll give him that. No escort?

281
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,011
My guide was killed
at the Masturah Well.

282
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,097
- Turks?
- No, an Arab.

283
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,808
Bloody savages.

284
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,646
- This is Wadi Safra, isn't it?
- Yes, they're over there.

285
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:15,441
Now, just a minute. What's
your name and who sent you?

286
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:19,403
Lawrence. I've been
seconded to the Arab Bureau.

287
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,530
Oh.

288
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,742
And what are you to do
for the Arab Bureau?

289
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:29,914
Well, it's rather vague, sir. I'm
to appreciate the situation.

290
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:34,501
Well, that won't be difficult.
The situation's bloody awful.

291
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,880
Their morale, if ever they
had any, which I doubt,

292
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:42,134
the Turks knocked out of them in
front of Medina, with howitzers.

293
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,762
They're fading away
by dozens every night.

294
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,639
What I want to say
to you is this:

295
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,558
That wherever you are
and whoever you are with,

296
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,644
you're a British-serving
officer. And here's an order.

297
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,314
When we get into that camp,
you're to keep your mouth shut.

298
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:56,815
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

299
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,777
Yes, sir. I understand
what you're saying.

300
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,737
You'll make your
appreciation and get back to...

301
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,242
Oh, my God.

302
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,745
Not again.

303
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:41,777
I've told him! God knows
I've told him.

304
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,197
"Move South," I've said.
"You're still in range."

305
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:50,619
They simply will not understand
what modern weapons do!

306
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,607
Stand and fight.
Stand and fight.

307
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:27,156
Fire back at them.

308
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:42,314
- Who are you?
- Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.

309
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,233
Seconded to the
Arab Bureau.

310
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:47,736
This is a bloody mess, sir.
We'll have to move south.

311
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,364
Yes, yes, colonel,
50 miles south.

312
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:53,492
You were right
and I was wrong.

313
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,828
We must take some
thought for the wounded.

314
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,788
Well, we can take care
of them at Yenbo, sir.

315
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,373
If they can
get to Yenbo.

316
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,083
Well, they can hardly
come with us, sir.

317
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:05,629
No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant...?

318
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:07,714
Lawrence.

319
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,425
You understand,
Lieutenant Lawrence,

320
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:15,681
my people are unused to
explosives and machines.

321
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:20,185
First the guns,
and now this.

322
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,116
Cigarette?

323
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,743
I'm sorry.

324
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,252
Hey.

325
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:30,380
Cigarette,
Your Excellency?

326
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,633
Umph off.

327
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:36,303
Please, Your Excellency.
Just one for two?

328
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,155
Hold it, Jenkins!

329
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:00,911
Jenkins! Jen...

330
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,830
Jenkins!

331
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:11,505
Aurens?

332
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:14,174
Aurens.

333
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,717
You have no servant.

334
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:18,470
- I don't need a servant.
- No?

335
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:22,432
We can do everything. Light
fires, cook food, wash clothes.

336
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:24,685
- Yes, everything.
- I don't doubt it.

337
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:28,021
- It will be very nice for you.
- I can't afford it.

338
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:55,507
Recite, then, as much of the
Koran as may be easy to you.

339
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:59,428
God knoweth that there
be some among you sick,

340
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:05,726
while others travel through the Earth
in quest for the bounties of God.

341
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:11,273
Others do battle
in his cause.

342
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:15,861
Recite, therefore,
as much as may be easy.

343
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:19,281
And observe the prayers.

344
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:25,912
This will be best and richest
in the recompense.

345
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,959
Seek ye the
forgiveness of God.

346
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:36,798
Verily, God is
forgiving, merciful...

347
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,508
Greetings, Ali.

348
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,469
- My lord.
- Sherif Ali.

349
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,931
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have
met Sherif Ali, I think.

350
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,642
Yes, my lord.

351
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:52,481
And now, Selim,
"The Brightness."

352
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,983
"By the noonday
brightness,

353
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,361
and by the night
when it darkeneth,

354
00:44:57,612 --> 00:45:00,030
thy Lord hath
not forsaken thee,

355
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,616
neither hath he
been displeased."

356
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:07,162
"And surely the future shall be
better for thee than the past."

357
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,957
"And in the end shall your
Lord be bounteous to thee

358
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,418
and thou be satisfied."

359
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,588
So...

360
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:19,925
Yes, colonel.

361
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:24,054
- I want a decision, sir.
- You want me to fall back on Yenbo.

362
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:27,015
Well, you're not doing
much good here, sir.

363
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:31,103
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir,
but we can't supply you here.

364
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,313
You could supply
us through Aqaba.

365
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,315
Aqaba?

366
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:38,819
Well, if you can get ahold of Aqaba,
sir, of course we can supply you.

367
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,987
- But you can't.
- You could.

368
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:44,074
You mean the navy?

369
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:48,286
The Turks have 12-inch
guns at Aqaba, sir.

370
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:50,539
Can you imagine
what that means?

371
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,541
Yes, I can imagine.

372
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:56,962
Put that out of your mind, sir. The
navy's got other things to do.

373
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:59,673
Oh, yes. Protecting
the Suez Canal.

374
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:04,136
The one essential sector of this
front is and must be the canal.

375
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,179
You can see that,
sir, surely.

376
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,349
I see that the canal is an
essential British interest.

377
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,560
It is of little
consequence to us.

378
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,104
I must ask you not
to speak like that, sir.

379
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:16,982
British and Arab interests
are one and the same.

380
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,110
- Possibly.
- Ha!

381
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:21,611
Ha!

382
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,947
Upon my word, sir,
you're ungrateful.

383
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,867
Fall back on Yenbo and we
will give you equipment.

384
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:29,244
Give you arms, advice,
training, everything.

385
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:32,372
- Guns?
- A modern rifle for every man.

386
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,500
No. Guns. Artillery.

387
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:39,045
Guns like the Turkish
guns at Medina.

388
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:42,299
Yes, give us guns
and keep the training.

389
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:45,260
Your men need training
far more than guns, sir.

390
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:48,138
Hmph. The English will
teach the Bedu to fight?

391
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:51,391
We will teach them, Sherif Ali, to
fight a modern, mechanised army.

392
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,226
In the...

393
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:58,273
Yes, lieutenant? What do
you think about Yenbo?

394
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:04,946
I think it is far
from Damascus.

395
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:08,575
We'll have you
in Damascus, sir. Never fear.

396
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,786
Have you been in
Damascus, Mr. Lawrence?

397
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,788
Yes, my lord.

398
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,458
It is beautiful, is it not?

399
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:18,418
- Very.
- That will do, Lawrence.

400
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:22,756
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus,
sir, but discipline will.

401
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:28,053
Look, sir, Great Britain is a small
country, it's much smaller than yours.

402
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:30,639
Small population
compared with some.

403
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,975
It's small, but it's
great. And why?

404
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:37,062
- Because it has guns.
- Because it has discipline.

405
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:41,483
Because it has a navy. Because of this,
the English go where they please

406
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:44,319
and strike where they please.
And this makes them great.

407
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,696
- Right.
- Mr. Lawrence, that will do!

408
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:49,199
Lieutenant Lawrence, sir, is
not your military adviser.

409
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,535
But I would like to
hear his opinion.

410
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,204
Damn it, Lawrence! Who do
you take your orders from?

411
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:57,874
From Lord Feisal,
in Feisal's tent.

412
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:03,380
Old fool! Why turn from him to him?
They are master and man.

413
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:08,176
My lord, I think...

414
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:11,304
I think your
book is right.

415
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:16,017
The desert is an ocean in
which no oar is dipped.

416
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:19,980
And on this ocean, the Bedu go where they
please and strike where they please.

417
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,482
This is the way the
Bedu has always fought.

418
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,652
You're famed throughout the
world for fighting in this way.

419
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,029
And this is the way
you should fight now.

420
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:29,864
I don't know.

421
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:32,367
I'm sorry, sir,
but you're wrong.

422
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:34,912
Fall back on Yenbo, sir,
and the Arab Rising

423
00:48:34,913 --> 00:48:36,830
becomes one poor unit
in the British army.

424
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,331
What is this to you?

425
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:39,833
Lawrence, do you
know you're a traitor?

426
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:42,002
No, no, colonel.

427
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:45,505
He is a young man, and
young men are passionate.

428
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,842
They must say their say.

429
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:55,015
But wiser people must decide.
I know you are right.

430
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,726
Very well, sir. When shall we move?
The sooner the better.

431
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:00,520
You'll lose another
50 men tonight.

432
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:04,482
You tread heavily...

433
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:08,236
but you speak the truth.

434
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:13,366
I will give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...

435
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:15,535
it is late.

436
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:36,806
Colonel Brighton means to put my men
under European officers, does he not?

437
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:38,933
In effect,
my lord, yes.

438
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,186
And I must do it,

439
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:45,565
because the Turks
have European guns.

440
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,485
But I fear to do it...

441
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:51,613
upon my soul I do.

442
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:57,702
The English have a great
hunger for desolate places.

443
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:01,122
I fear they hunger
for Arabia.

444
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:03,291
Then you must
deny it to them.

445
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:07,128
You are an Englishman. Are
you not loyal to England?

446
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:10,674
To England and
to other things.

447
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:13,551
To England and
Arabia both?

448
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:15,595
And is that possible?

449
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:26,564
I think you are another of
these desert-loving English.

450
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:28,942
Doughty, Stanhope,

451
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,903
Gordon of Khartoum.

452
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:34,364
No Arab loves the desert.

453
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:39,577
We love water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.

454
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:43,123
And no man
needs nothing.

455
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:49,838
Or is it that you think we are
something you can play with,

456
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:53,675
because we are a little
people, a silly people,

457
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:58,138
greedy, barbarous
and cruel?

458
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,725
Or do you know, lieutenant,
in the Arab city of Cordoba

459
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,436
were two miles of public
lighting in the streets

460
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,396
when London was a village.

461
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:09,441
Yes, you were great.

462
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:11,818
Nine centuries ago.

463
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,237
Time to be great
again, my lord.

464
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:17,741
Which is why my father made
this war upon the Turks.

465
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:21,745
My father, Mr. Lawrence,
not the English.

466
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:25,248
But my father is old...

467
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,959
and I...

468
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:33,381
I long for the vanished
gardens of Cordoba.

469
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:38,178
However, before the gardens
must come the fighting.

470
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:43,183
To be great again, it seems
that we need the English,

471
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,684
or...

472
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,311
Or?

473
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:50,482
What no man can
provide, Mr. Lawrence.

474
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:53,193
We need a miracle.

475
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,587
Aqaba.

476
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:04,509
Aqaba.

477
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:06,970
From the land.

478
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,722
You are mad.

479
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:14,477
To come to Aqaba by land we should
have to cross the Nefud Desert.

480
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:15,979
That's right.

481
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,523
The Nefud cannot
be crossed.

482
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:20,608
I'll cross it if you will.

483
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:24,946
You? It takes more than
a compass, Englishman.

484
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:27,991
The Nefud is the worst
place God created.

485
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:32,245
I can't answer for the place.
Only for myself.

486
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,163
Fifty men?

487
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:36,958
Fifty? Against Aqaba?

488
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,585
If 50 men came
out of the Nefud

489
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:42,880
they would be 50 men
other men might join.

490
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:46,009
The Howeitat
are there, I hear.

491
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:49,345
The Howeitat are brigands. They'll
sell themselves to anyone.

492
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,848
- Good fighters, though.
- Good...

493
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:56,227
Yes. There are
guns at Aqaba.

494
00:55:56,478 --> 00:56:00,648
They face the sea, Sherif Ali,
and cannot be turned around.

495
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:04,569
From the landward side,
there are no guns at Aqaba.

496
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:09,824
With good reason. It cannot be
approached from the landward side.

497
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:12,702
Certainly the Turks
don't dream of it.

498
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:18,124
Aqaba's over there.

499
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,920
It's only a matter of going.

500
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,382
You are mad.

501
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:36,059
And where are
you going, lieutenant?

502
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,437
With 50 of my men.

503
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,273
To work your miracle.

504
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:46,736
Blasphemy is a bad beginning
for such a journey.

505
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:50,073
- Who told you?
- Ali did.

506
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,949
Why not you?

507
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:56,579
You are falling back
from Yenbo, sir?

508
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,082
Yes. Yes, I must.

509
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:02,376
But I will spare
these to you.

510
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:07,381
Did Ali break
confidence to tell me?

511
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:11,969
Sherif Ali owes you
his allegiance, my lord.

512
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:15,181
Yet you did not tell
Colonel Brighton.

513
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:16,682
No.

514
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,655
Since you do know,

515
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:34,700
we can claim to ride in the
name of Feisal of Mecca.

516
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,371
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence,
you may claim it.

517
00:57:39,248 --> 00:57:42,333
But in whose name
do you ride?

518
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,567
Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.

519
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:16,070
They were here.
I caught them.

520
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:19,198
Why are you here? Boy!

521
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:21,284
To serve Lord
Aurens, sherif.

522
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:24,161
This is true, Aurens.
They do wish it.

523
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:26,247
You have been
tracking us.

524
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:29,166
- You were told to stay.
- No, sherif.

525
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:31,460
Our camel strayed.
We followed her.

526
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:34,630
She led us here to be
Lord Aurens' servants.

527
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,508
- It is the will of Allah.
- Blasphemy.

528
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:39,010
Don't do that.

529
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:44,181
No, Aurens, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-less.

530
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:47,560
Be warned. They
are not suitable.

531
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:51,522
They sound very suitable. You
can ride with the baggage.

532
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,569
These are not servants.
These are worshippers.

533
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:59,655
Aurens.

534
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,409
One shilling,
every week.

535
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,244
That is fair.

536
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:07,246
- Each.
- No.

537
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,081
- That is too much.
- All right.

538
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:21,802
They will be lucky for you. Allah
favours the compassionate.

539
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,485
There is the railway.

540
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,280
And that is the desert.

541
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:46,494
From here until the other side,
no water but what we carry.

542
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:49,955
For the camels, no water at all.

543
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:52,708
If the camels die...

544
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:55,419
we die.

545
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:59,173
And in 20 days
they will start to die.

546
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,640
There's no time to
waste, then, is there?

547
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:09,141
Hut!

548
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,835
I was thinking.

549
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:43,796
You were drifting.

550
01:04:45,757 --> 01:04:49,426
Yes. It will not
happen again.

551
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,389
Be warned, you
were drifting.

552
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:56,100
It will not
happen again.

553
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,122
That water is wasted.

554
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:07,838
From now on, we must
travel by night

555
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:11,008
and rest while it is
too hot to travel.

556
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:13,677
A few hours each day.

557
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,473
Why don't we start now?

558
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:20,351
No. We will rest now.

559
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,312
Three hours.

560
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:24,938
Fine.

561
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,024
I'll wake you.

562
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,080
Do we rest here?

563
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:50,501
There is no rest now
short of water, Aurens.

564
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:52,795
The other side of that.

565
01:08:53,922 --> 01:08:56,131
And how much
of that is there?

566
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:58,008
I'm not sure.

567
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:03,430
But however much, it must be crossed
before tomorrow's sun gets up.

568
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,767
This is the sun's anvil.

569
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:40,652
Have we done it?

570
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,947
No, but we're
off the anvil.

571
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:46,450
Thank God for
that anyway.

572
01:10:46,618 --> 01:10:48,493
Yes, thank Him.

573
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:52,372
Aurens, I do not think you
know how you have tempted him.

574
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:53,916
I know.

575
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,754
We've done it.

576
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:00,589
God willing.

577
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,760
When do we
reach the wells?

578
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:08,305
God willing,
midday.

579
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:12,059
- Then we've done it.
- Thank him, Aurens. Thank him.

580
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:13,894
Aurens.

581
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:17,481
Gasim's.

582
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:23,111
What's happened to him?

583
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,405
God knows.

584
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:28,951
Why don't you stop?

585
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:32,913
For what? He will
be dead by midday.

586
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:40,003
We must go back.

587
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:43,131
What for, to die
with Gasim?

588
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:46,677
In one hour
comes the sun.

589
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:52,849
In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!

590
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:54,393
I can.

591
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:56,895
Take the boys.

592
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:05,278
If you go back, you
kill yourself, is all.

593
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,739
Gasim you have
killed already.

594
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:09,574
Get out of my way.

595
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:13,829
Gasim's time is come,
Aurens. It is written.

596
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:15,330
Nothing is written!

597
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:19,876
Go back, then!

598
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:23,588
What did you bring us here for
with your blasphemous conceit?

599
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,508
Eh? English blasphemer!

600
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,219
Aqaba?

601
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:31,513
Was it Aqaba?

602
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:35,058
You will not be
at Aqaba, English!

603
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:38,729
Go back, blasphemer,

604
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,273
but you will not
be at Aqaba.

605
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,400
I shall be at Aqaba.

606
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:45,694
That is written.

607
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:47,571
In here.

608
01:12:57,457 --> 01:12:59,291
English!

609
01:12:59,459 --> 01:13:01,126
English!

610
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:30,538
Aurens!

611
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,708
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye!

612
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:35,710
Daud!

613
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:37,147
Aurens! Daud!

614
01:19:58,294 --> 01:20:01,087
Daud! Daud!

615
01:20:01,255 --> 01:20:03,548
Farraj!

616
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:10,597
Daud.

617
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:26,529
Aurens.

618
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:47,694
Nothing is written.

619
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:15,680
Aurens.

620
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:18,182
Aurens.

621
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:21,477
El Aurens.

622
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:27,317
Farraj.

623
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:29,611
Wash.

624
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:57,639
Farraj.

625
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,524
El Aurens.

626
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:13,613
Truly, for some men nothing is
written unless they write it.

627
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:21,245
Not El Aurens.
Just Lawrence.

628
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:24,207
- El Aurens is better.
- True.

629
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,836
Your father too,
just Mr. Lawrence?

630
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:37,929
My father is Sir
Thomas Chapman.

631
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,932
- Is that a lord?
- A kind of lord.

632
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:43,851
Then when he dies,
you too will be a lord.

633
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,353
No.

634
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:46,854
Ah.

635
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:49,482
You have an elder brother.

636
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:50,983
No.

637
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:53,611
But then, I do not
understand this.

638
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,155
- Your father's name is Chapman.
- Ali.

639
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,617
He didn't marry my mother.

640
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:02,829
I see.

641
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,706
I'm sorry.

642
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:10,586
It seems to me that you are free
to choose your own name, then.

643
01:24:13,132 --> 01:24:15,675
Yes, I suppose I am.

644
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:18,720
El Aurens is best.

645
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:25,768
All right, I'll settle
for El Aurens.

646
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:58,509
They are the robes of a
sherif of the Beni Wejh.

647
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:12,899
Very fine.

648
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:18,988
- Great honour.
- The honour is to us. <i>Salaam,</i> sherif.

649
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:21,657
- Is it permitted?
- Surely.

650
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:24,410
- <i>Salaam.</i>
- <i>Salaam.</i>

651
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:31,876
He for whom nothing is written may
write himself a clan. <i>Salaam.</i>

652
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:35,004
- <i>Salaam.</i>
- <i>Salaam.</i>

653
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:43,179
They are good
for riding. Try.

654
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:36,959
What are you doing,
Englishman?

655
01:27:38,337 --> 01:27:39,921
As you see.

656
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:42,256
Are you alone?

657
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:44,300
Almost.

658
01:27:52,935 --> 01:27:55,394
Are you with that party of dogs
who are drinking at my well?

659
01:27:55,646 --> 01:27:57,021
Yours?

660
01:28:00,651 --> 01:28:02,443
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

661
01:28:04,196 --> 01:28:07,031
I've heard of another
man of that name.

662
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:09,659
Other? What other?

663
01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:14,205
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to
summon help to look after his wells.

664
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:19,919
He must be a great hero.

665
01:28:20,087 --> 01:28:21,837
He is.

666
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:25,174
He wouldn't refuse water to men
coming out of the great Nefud Desert.

667
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:27,635
Now, would he not?

668
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:29,595
Hm.

669
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:33,057
No, that must be some other man.

670
01:28:35,519 --> 01:28:37,436
Here is my help.

671
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:05,798
Son, what
fashion is this?

672
01:29:07,134 --> 01:29:10,803
- Harith, Father.
- What manner of Harith?

673
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:12,763
A Beni Wejh sherif.

674
01:29:13,724 --> 01:29:15,224
And is he Harith?

675
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:17,685
No, Father, English.

676
01:29:20,897 --> 01:29:22,273
Son,

677
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:25,192
they are stealing
our water.

678
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:27,903
Tell them we
are coming.

679
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:30,656
- Tell them.
- Ha!

680
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:41,393
- Empty that!
- Do not!

681
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:45,856
It is Auda of the Howeitat
who speaks.

682
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:48,651
It is Ali of the Harith
who answers.

683
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:06,127
Harith.

684
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:08,212
Ali.

685
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:11,132
Does your father
still steal?

686
01:31:13,135 --> 01:31:14,468
No.

687
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:19,056
Does Auda take me for one
of his own bastards?

688
01:31:20,267 --> 01:31:23,435
No. There is no
resemblance.

689
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:26,689
Alas, you resemble
your father.

690
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:30,067
- Auda flatters me.
- You are easily flattered.

691
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:33,028
I knew your father well.

692
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:35,322
Did you know your own?

693
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,492
Auda!

694
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:43,414
We are 50, you are two.
How if we shot you down?

695
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:47,001
Why, then you have a blood
feud with the Howeitat.

696
01:31:48,295 --> 01:31:51,338
- Do you desire it?
- Not the generals in Cairo,

697
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,925
nor the sultan
himself desire that.

698
01:31:57,888 --> 01:31:59,221
Call off your men.

699
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:01,223
No, no, boy.

700
01:32:04,811 --> 01:32:07,438
This honours
the unworthy.

701
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:09,857
I've only just begun
to teach him.

702
01:32:10,108 --> 01:32:14,361
And what are you teaching him today?
Howeitat hospitality?

703
01:32:14,613 --> 01:32:16,614
Be not clever
with me, English.

704
01:32:18,325 --> 01:32:21,619
- Who is he?
- A friend of Prince Feisal's.

705
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:24,538
Oh.

706
01:32:31,087 --> 01:32:34,256
- So you desire my hospitality?
- Yes.

707
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:36,008
Is he your tongue?

708
01:32:36,718 --> 01:32:38,510
We do desire it.

709
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:44,642
Then it is given,
if you will take it.

710
01:32:46,311 --> 01:32:48,145
I'm at my summer camp,
a poor place.

711
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:53,108
Well, to me it seems a poor place.
Some men find it marvellous.

712
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:58,322
Tomorrow, maybe I will allow the
Turks to buy you, friends of Feisal.

713
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:00,824
But,

714
01:33:01,284 --> 01:33:02,618
dine with me.

715
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:05,454
Dine with Auda, English.

716
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:08,791
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.

717
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:14,338
It is my pleasure that you dine
with me in Wadi Rumm!

718
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:57,668
This thing you work
against Aqaba,

719
01:35:58,044 --> 01:36:00,421
what profit do you
hope from it?

720
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:03,298
We work it for
Feisal of Mecca.

721
01:36:03,466 --> 01:36:05,592
The Harith do not
work for profit.

722
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:10,472
Well, if it is in a man to be
a servant, Sherif Ali,

723
01:36:10,974 --> 01:36:13,517
he could find worse
masters than Feisal.

724
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:16,687
But I...
I cannot serve.

725
01:36:17,564 --> 01:36:20,649
You permit the Turks
to stay in Aqaba.

726
01:36:20,817 --> 01:36:22,860
Yes, it is my pleasure.

727
01:36:27,866 --> 01:36:31,326
We do not work this
thing for Feisal.

728
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:32,870
No?

729
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:36,582
- For the English, then?
- For the Arabs.

730
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:38,625
The Arabs?

731
01:36:39,419 --> 01:36:43,755
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.

732
01:36:43,923 --> 01:36:45,924
I have even heard
of the Harith.

733
01:36:46,593 --> 01:36:48,093
But the Arabs?

734
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:50,721
What tribe is that?

735
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:56,602
They're a tribe of slaves.
They serve the Turks.

736
01:36:56,769 --> 01:36:58,854
Well, they are
nothing to me.

737
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:00,981
My tribe is
the Howeitat.

738
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:03,525
Who work only
for profit.

739
01:37:03,693 --> 01:37:05,444
Who work at
Auda's pleasure.

740
01:37:05,612 --> 01:37:08,280
And Auda's pleasure
is to serve the Turks.

741
01:37:08,448 --> 01:37:09,698
Serve?

742
01:37:09,866 --> 01:37:11,158
I serve?

743
01:37:11,326 --> 01:37:13,952
It is the servant
who takes money.

744
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:20,959
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

745
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:23,086
- Does Auda serve?
- No!

746
01:37:23,254 --> 01:37:26,423
- Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?
- No!

747
01:37:31,054 --> 01:37:35,182
I carry 23 great wounds,
all got in battle.

748
01:37:35,642 --> 01:37:39,186
Seventy-five men have I killed
with my own hands, in battle.

749
01:37:39,354 --> 01:37:43,565
I scatter, I burn my enemies' tents.
I take away their flocks and herds.

750
01:37:43,733 --> 01:37:47,903
The Turks pay me a golden
treasure, yet I am poor!

751
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:52,241
Because I am a
river to my people.

752
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:02,125
Is that service?

753
01:38:02,585 --> 01:38:03,919
No.

754
01:38:10,677 --> 01:38:14,221
And yet now it seems
Auda has grown old.

755
01:38:14,389 --> 01:38:17,140
And lost his taste
for fighting.

756
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:21,520
It is well you say it in
my tent, thou old tulip.

757
01:38:21,688 --> 01:38:25,482
Yet this is a tulip that
the Turks could not buy.

758
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:27,442
Why should they wish to?

759
01:38:29,362 --> 01:38:30,696
Now...

760
01:38:31,281 --> 01:38:35,534
I will tell you what they pay me,
and you will tell me if this is

761
01:38:35,702 --> 01:38:37,995
a servant's wages.

762
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:42,207
They pay me,
month by month,

763
01:38:42,375 --> 01:38:46,461
100 golden guineas.

764
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:50,882
150, Auda.

765
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:54,011
- Who told you that?
- I have long ears.

766
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:56,513
And a long tongue
between them.

767
01:38:56,681 --> 01:39:00,100
100, 150, what
matters? It's a trifle.

768
01:39:00,268 --> 01:39:04,104
A trifle which they take
from a great box they have.

769
01:39:04,272 --> 01:39:06,273
In Aqaba.

770
01:39:07,525 --> 01:39:10,235
- In Aqaba?
- Where else?

771
01:39:11,112 --> 01:39:13,989
You trouble me
like women.

772
01:39:14,365 --> 01:39:17,242
Friends, we've been foolish.
Auda will not come to Aqaba.

773
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:18,744
- No.
- For money?

774
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:20,245
- No.
- For Feisal?

775
01:39:20,413 --> 01:39:24,124
- No.
- Nor to drive away the Turks.

776
01:39:24,917 --> 01:39:26,793
He will come...

777
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:30,047
because it is his pleasure.

778
01:39:32,008 --> 01:39:35,677
Thy mother mated
with a scorpion.

779
01:39:37,096 --> 01:39:40,515
Make God your agent!

780
01:39:41,893 --> 01:39:44,102
Aqaba!

781
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:45,979
Aqaba!

782
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:03,622
God be with you.

783
01:40:06,584 --> 01:40:08,251
God be with you.

784
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:24,267
God be with you.

785
01:40:24,686 --> 01:40:26,770
God be with you.

786
01:43:22,321 --> 01:43:23,655
Yes.

787
01:43:23,823 --> 01:43:25,156
Aqaba.

788
01:43:26,784 --> 01:43:29,452
Tomorrow we will
go and get it.

789
01:43:30,663 --> 01:43:33,623
- Do you think we shall?
- Yes.

790
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:35,542
If you are right
about the guns.

791
01:44:04,447 --> 01:44:07,198
He killed.
He dies.

792
01:44:07,909 --> 01:44:10,118
This is the end
of Aqaba.

793
01:44:12,788 --> 01:44:15,874
- One of our men murdered one of
Auda's man. - Why?

794
01:44:16,042 --> 01:44:19,085
Theft? Blood feud?
It makes no matter why.

795
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:20,754
Ali!

796
01:44:21,172 --> 01:44:23,048
It is an ancient wound.

797
01:44:23,215 --> 01:44:26,176
I didn't come here to
watch a tribal bloodbath.

798
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:32,849
It is the law, Aurens.

799
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:35,310
The law says
the man must die.

800
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:39,314
If he dies, will that
content the Howeitat?

801
01:44:40,274 --> 01:44:41,608
Yes.

802
01:44:45,071 --> 01:44:46,696
Sherif Ali!

803
01:44:46,864 --> 01:44:49,824
If none of Lord Auda's
men harms any of yours,

804
01:44:50,242 --> 01:44:53,453
- will that content the Harith?
- Yes.

805
01:44:59,627 --> 01:45:02,253
Then I will execute the law.

806
01:45:03,255 --> 01:45:05,382
I have no tribe.

807
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:08,927
And no one is offended.

808
01:45:21,065 --> 01:45:22,399
Gasim.

809
01:45:26,862 --> 01:45:28,321
Did you do it?

810
01:45:55,266 --> 01:45:56,891
Well, Aurens...

811
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,859
What ails the
Englishman?

812
01:46:06,027 --> 01:46:09,529
That that he killed was the man
he brought out of the Nefud.

813
01:46:09,697 --> 01:46:11,698
It was written, then.

814
01:46:12,533 --> 01:46:14,534
Better to have left him.

815
01:46:18,205 --> 01:46:21,499
It was execution, Aurens.
No shame in that.

816
01:46:21,917 --> 01:46:24,210
Besides, it
was necessary.

817
01:46:25,254 --> 01:46:27,505
You gave life
and you took it.

818
01:46:28,049 --> 01:46:29,632
The writing
is still yours.

819
01:47:06,796 --> 01:47:08,922
Auda Abu Tayi!

820
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:27,161
The miracle is
accomplished.

821
01:50:28,163 --> 01:50:29,789
Garlands for
the conqueror.

822
01:50:50,936 --> 01:50:54,105
Tribute for the prince.
Flowers for the man.

823
01:50:54,898 --> 01:50:56,649
I'm none of those
things, Ali.

824
01:50:56,817 --> 01:50:59,485
- What, then?
- Don't know.

825
01:51:00,487 --> 01:51:01,821
Thanks.

826
01:51:03,407 --> 01:51:05,325
My God, I love this country.

827
01:51:06,994 --> 01:51:08,328
What?

828
01:51:09,997 --> 01:51:12,332
No gold in Aqaba!
No great box!

829
01:51:12,499 --> 01:51:14,917
Auda, I found it!

830
01:51:24,136 --> 01:51:25,762
That's a pity.

831
01:51:29,308 --> 01:51:31,893
Ali, you get a message
down the coast to Yenbo.

832
01:51:32,061 --> 01:51:34,604
Tell Feisal to find
boats, any boats,

833
01:51:34,772 --> 01:51:37,815
and bring the Arab army
here to Aqaba, quickly.

834
01:51:37,983 --> 01:51:39,317
And you?

835
01:51:40,110 --> 01:51:42,653
I'm going to tell
the generals

836
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:44,989
in Cairo.

837
01:51:45,157 --> 01:51:47,283
Yes, cross Sinai.

838
01:51:47,451 --> 01:51:48,785
Come on!

839
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:50,453
Sinai?

840
01:51:50,913 --> 01:51:52,246
Yes.

841
01:51:52,748 --> 01:51:56,417
- With these?
- They'll be all right with me.

842
01:52:01,715 --> 01:52:06,219
Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin
arrived in Cairo and said:

843
01:52:06,387 --> 01:52:08,971
"We've taken Aqaba,"
the generals would laugh.

844
01:52:09,681 --> 01:52:11,015
I see.

845
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:14,811
In Cairo you will put off
these funny clothes.

846
01:52:14,978 --> 01:52:19,190
You will wear trousers and tell stories
of our quaintness and barbarity

847
01:52:19,817 --> 01:52:22,068
and then they will
believe you.

848
01:52:22,653 --> 01:52:24,779
You're an ignorant man.

849
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,259
Paper.

850
01:52:47,177 --> 01:52:48,970
Paper!

851
01:52:51,723 --> 01:52:54,392
There is no gold in Aqaba.

852
01:52:55,477 --> 01:52:57,311
No gold.

853
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:00,648
No great box!

854
01:53:04,862 --> 01:53:07,155
Did Auda come to
Aqaba for gold?

855
01:53:07,739 --> 01:53:10,032
For my pleasure,
as you said.

856
01:53:11,285 --> 01:53:13,786
But gold is honourable...

857
01:53:14,872 --> 01:53:17,540
and Aurens promised gold.

858
01:53:18,459 --> 01:53:19,792
Aurens lied.

859
01:53:21,753 --> 01:53:23,171
See, Auda.

860
01:53:25,841 --> 01:53:27,967
"The Crown of England...

861
01:53:29,094 --> 01:53:31,512
promises to pay...

862
01:53:32,514 --> 01:53:36,934
5000 golden guineas...

863
01:53:37,436 --> 01:53:42,148
to Auda Abu Tayi."

864
01:53:43,275 --> 01:53:47,570
Signed in
His Majesty's absence

865
01:53:47,821 --> 01:53:49,238
by...

866
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:52,158
me.

867
01:53:53,243 --> 01:53:55,369
In 10 days...

868
01:53:56,121 --> 01:53:58,206
I'll be back with the gold.

869
01:53:59,333 --> 01:54:04,086
With gold, with guns,
with everything.

870
01:54:05,172 --> 01:54:06,756
Ten days.

871
01:54:08,008 --> 01:54:09,675
You'll cross Sinai?

872
01:54:09,968 --> 01:54:11,344
Why not?

873
01:54:12,054 --> 01:54:13,804
Moses did.

874
01:54:16,433 --> 01:54:18,643
And you will take
the children?

875
01:54:19,895 --> 01:54:21,354
Moses did.

876
01:54:21,522 --> 01:54:23,231
Moses was a prophet,

877
01:54:23,732 --> 01:54:26,359
and beloved of God.

878
01:54:31,657 --> 01:54:35,743
He said there was
gold here. He lied.

879
01:54:37,037 --> 01:54:39,914
He is not perfect.

880
01:54:50,008 --> 01:54:52,468
Lord, can we
not rest?

881
01:54:52,636 --> 01:54:55,763
I told you, no rest till
they know that I have Aqaba.

882
01:54:58,016 --> 01:54:59,684
Have you two
slept in beds?

883
01:54:59,851 --> 01:55:01,185
Farraj?

884
01:55:01,728 --> 01:55:03,062
Daud?

885
01:55:04,273 --> 01:55:05,982
With sheets?

886
01:55:07,901 --> 01:55:11,404
Tomorrow the finest sheets in the finest
room in the finest hotel in Cairo.

887
01:55:11,572 --> 01:55:12,905
I promise.

888
01:55:13,156 --> 01:55:15,783
Then it shall
be so, lord.

889
01:55:37,139 --> 01:55:38,514
Look!

890
01:55:45,272 --> 01:55:46,856
Pillar of fire.

891
01:55:50,068 --> 01:55:52,069
No, lord. Dust.

892
01:56:41,662 --> 01:56:43,162
My compass.

893
01:56:44,956 --> 01:56:46,290
No matter.

894
01:56:46,708 --> 01:56:50,461
If we ride west, we
must strike the canal.

895
01:56:51,588 --> 01:56:52,963
Due west.

896
01:57:13,610 --> 01:57:15,069
Come on!

897
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:51,147
Aurens!

898
01:57:53,275 --> 01:57:54,859
Aurens!

899
01:58:03,827 --> 01:58:05,161
Farraj!

900
01:58:12,377 --> 01:58:14,211
Farraj!

901
01:58:15,422 --> 01:58:18,299
Farraj, don't! Don't!

902
01:58:19,384 --> 01:58:20,760
Don't!

903
01:59:53,937 --> 01:59:55,521
Aurens.

904
01:59:56,106 --> 01:59:57,439
Why do you walk?

905
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:02,111
But why, lord?

906
02:00:08,618 --> 02:00:10,452
Aurens.

907
02:00:13,415 --> 02:00:14,748
But why, lord?

908
02:00:14,916 --> 02:00:18,419
There is room for both.
It serves no purpose.

909
02:00:44,112 --> 02:00:46,614
Aurens, look!

910
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:17,561
Aurens.

911
02:01:33,662 --> 02:01:36,205
Aurens. Aurens.

912
02:01:42,379 --> 02:01:44,421
Aurens.

913
02:01:55,558 --> 02:01:57,643
It's all right, Farraj.

914
02:01:57,811 --> 02:01:59,353
It's all right.

915
02:02:58,163 --> 02:03:03,125
Hey-ey-ey-ey! Hey-ey-ey-ey!
Hey-ey-ey-ey! Hey-ey-ey-ey!

916
02:03:11,259 --> 02:03:13,177
Who are you?

917
02:03:15,263 --> 02:03:18,015
Who are you?

918
02:03:53,384 --> 02:03:55,969
- Daud!
- We're here, sir.

919
02:04:14,155 --> 02:04:15,739
You taking him
in there, sir?

920
02:04:16,866 --> 02:04:18,242
Yes.

921
02:04:38,763 --> 02:04:40,139
Here!

922
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:44,434
Here. You!

923
02:04:45,979 --> 02:04:49,481
And where the hell do you think
you're going to, Mustapha?

924
02:04:50,233 --> 02:04:51,733
We are thirsty.

925
02:04:53,528 --> 02:04:55,988
- Mr. Lawrence, is it?
- Yes.

926
02:04:56,447 --> 02:04:59,533
- Are you going to the officers' bar, sir?
- Yes.

927
02:05:00,785 --> 02:05:03,078
You can't take
him in there, sir.

928
02:05:06,708 --> 02:05:09,293
What do you think
you look like?

929
02:05:27,979 --> 02:05:29,646
No, no.
You must go.

930
02:05:29,814 --> 02:05:31,398
No, no. Go,
effendi, go!

931
02:05:33,234 --> 02:05:36,028
Get out! You must
get out! Get out!

932
02:05:37,655 --> 02:05:41,909
We want two large
glasses of lemonade.

933
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,827
This is a bar for
British officers.

934
02:05:43,995 --> 02:05:45,662
That's all right. We
are not particular.

935
02:05:45,830 --> 02:05:47,623
Lawrence!

936
02:05:51,085 --> 02:05:52,419
Are you off your head?

937
02:05:52,587 --> 02:05:55,214
No. Oddly enough I'm not.

938
02:05:55,506 --> 02:05:57,507
Now look here, Lawrence. Just
clear out of here, will you?

939
02:05:57,675 --> 02:05:59,134
Get that boy out of here.

940
02:05:59,427 --> 02:06:02,137
Corporal, we'll have
this one out anyway.

941
02:06:02,805 --> 02:06:05,349
- Get that wog out of here.
- Yes, clear off.

942
02:06:07,477 --> 02:06:09,186
What's going on?

943
02:06:12,148 --> 02:06:15,609
- It's Lawrence, sir.
- Lemonade with ice.

944
02:06:15,777 --> 02:06:17,236
Well?

945
02:06:17,403 --> 02:06:18,987
Explain yourself.

946
02:06:19,697 --> 02:06:21,448
We've taken Aqaba.

947
02:06:21,991 --> 02:06:24,660
- Taken Aqaba? Who has?
- We have.

948
02:06:24,911 --> 02:06:29,414
Our side in this war
has. The wogs have.

949
02:06:30,124 --> 02:06:31,500
We have.

950
02:06:33,253 --> 02:06:35,128
He likes your
lemonade.

951
02:06:35,463 --> 02:06:37,422
You mean the
Turks have gone?

952
02:06:37,715 --> 02:06:40,634
No, they're still there,
but they've no boots.

953
02:06:41,177 --> 02:06:45,264
Prisoners, sir. We took them prisoners.
The entire garrison.

954
02:06:45,765 --> 02:06:47,975
No, that's not true.
We killed some.

955
02:06:48,226 --> 02:06:52,145
Too many, really. I'll
manage it better next time.

956
02:06:53,481 --> 02:06:56,400
There's been a lot of
killing one way or another.

957
02:06:58,486 --> 02:07:01,989
Cross my heart and hope to
die, it's all perfectly true.

958
02:07:02,240 --> 02:07:04,992
- It isn't possible.
- Yes, it is.

959
02:07:05,368 --> 02:07:07,160
I did it.

960
02:07:12,375 --> 02:07:13,709
You'd better
talk to Allenby.

961
02:07:13,876 --> 02:07:15,210
General Allenby?

962
02:07:15,378 --> 02:07:17,170
Yes, he's in command
now. Murray's gone.

963
02:07:17,338 --> 02:07:19,631
Well, that's a step
in the right direction.

964
02:07:20,383 --> 02:07:23,135
First, I want a room.
With a bed, with sheets.

965
02:07:23,428 --> 02:07:26,138
- Yes, of course.
- It's for him.

966
02:07:27,849 --> 02:07:30,767
Right. You want a bed
yourself, don't you?

967
02:07:31,019 --> 02:07:33,020
See Allenby
first, though.

968
02:07:33,688 --> 02:07:35,314
Will he see me?

969
02:07:36,107 --> 02:07:37,607
I think so.

970
02:07:38,318 --> 02:07:39,901
Do that, then.

971
02:07:44,782 --> 02:07:47,451
- I'd better shave.
- Yes, you had.

972
02:07:47,618 --> 02:07:50,245
You'd better get into
some trousers too.

973
02:08:01,382 --> 02:08:03,258
"Undisciplined.

974
02:08:05,136 --> 02:08:07,095
Unpunctual.

975
02:08:08,222 --> 02:08:10,182
Untidy.

976
02:08:12,018 --> 02:08:14,144
Several languages.

977
02:08:15,438 --> 02:08:17,439
Knowledge of music...

978
02:08:18,316 --> 02:08:20,067
literature.

979
02:08:21,152 --> 02:08:23,111
Knowledge of...

980
02:08:24,489 --> 02:08:26,239
Knowledge of..."

981
02:08:29,494 --> 02:08:32,454
You're an interesting man,
there's no doubt about it.

982
02:08:33,081 --> 02:08:36,208
- Who told you to take Aqaba?
- Nobody.

983
02:08:36,501 --> 02:08:39,169
- Sir.
- Sir.

984
02:08:39,420 --> 02:08:40,796
Then why did you?

985
02:08:40,963 --> 02:08:43,507
- Aqaba's important.
- Why is it important?

986
02:08:43,674 --> 02:08:46,218
- It's the Turkish route to the canal.
- Not anymore.

987
02:08:46,386 --> 02:08:47,719
They're coming
through Beersheba.

988
02:08:47,887 --> 02:08:50,639
I know, but we've gone
forward to Gaza.

989
02:08:50,807 --> 02:08:55,394
- So?
- So that left Aqaba behind your right.

990
02:08:55,728 --> 02:08:57,062
True.

991
02:08:57,230 --> 02:09:01,858
And it will be further behind your
right when you go for Jerusalem.

992
02:09:02,735 --> 02:09:05,153
Am I going
for Jerusalem?

993
02:09:05,321 --> 02:09:06,655
Yes.

994
02:09:08,991 --> 02:09:10,409
Very well.

995
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:12,911
Aqaba behind
my right.

996
02:09:13,162 --> 02:09:16,039
It threatened
El' Arîsh and Gaza.

997
02:09:17,458 --> 02:09:18,834
Anything else?

998
02:09:19,001 --> 02:09:20,335
Yes.

999
02:09:20,503 --> 02:09:22,921
Aqaba's linked
with Medina.

1000
02:09:23,464 --> 02:09:26,508
Do you think we should shift
them out of Medina now?

1001
02:09:26,759 --> 02:09:30,345
No. I think you should
leave them there.

1002
02:09:30,513 --> 02:09:32,514
You acted without
orders, you know.

1003
02:09:33,224 --> 02:09:37,477
Shouldn't officers use
their initiative at all times?

1004
02:09:37,645 --> 02:09:40,063
Not really. It's awfully
dangerous, Lawrence.

1005
02:09:40,231 --> 02:09:42,566
Yes, I know.

1006
02:09:42,817 --> 02:09:44,359
Already?

1007
02:09:44,527 --> 02:09:45,861
Yes.

1008
02:09:47,613 --> 02:09:50,240
I'm promoting
you major.

1009
02:09:51,242 --> 02:09:53,535
I don't think that's
a very good idea.

1010
02:09:53,703 --> 02:09:56,830
I didn't ask you.
I want you to go back

1011
02:09:56,998 --> 02:10:00,667
and carry on
the good work.

1012
02:10:01,169 --> 02:10:04,004
No.
Thank you, sir.

1013
02:10:04,505 --> 02:10:08,508
- Why not?
- Well, I, it's...

1014
02:10:08,676 --> 02:10:10,051
Let me see now...

1015
02:10:11,762 --> 02:10:15,515
I killed two people.
I mean, two Arabs.

1016
02:10:15,683 --> 02:10:17,976
One was a boy.

1017
02:10:18,144 --> 02:10:19,603
That was...

1018
02:10:21,189 --> 02:10:23,106
yesterday.

1019
02:10:23,274 --> 02:10:25,317
I led him into
a quicksand.

1020
02:10:25,568 --> 02:10:27,235
The other was a man.

1021
02:10:27,570 --> 02:10:29,529
That was...

1022
02:10:29,697 --> 02:10:32,157
before Aqaba, anyway.

1023
02:10:32,825 --> 02:10:35,494
I had to execute
him with my pistol.

1024
02:10:35,995 --> 02:10:39,080
There was something
about it I didn't like.

1025
02:10:39,332 --> 02:10:42,459
- Well, naturally.
- No. Something else.

1026
02:10:44,712 --> 02:10:47,130
I see. Well, that's all right.
Let it be a warning.

1027
02:10:47,298 --> 02:10:49,382
No. Something else.

1028
02:10:51,010 --> 02:10:52,636
What, then?

1029
02:10:53,513 --> 02:10:55,889
I enjoyed it.

1030
02:11:03,397 --> 02:11:06,942
Rubbish. Rubbish
and nerves. You're tired.

1031
02:11:08,694 --> 02:11:12,364
What do you mean by coming here
dressed like that? Amateur theatricals?

1032
02:11:12,532 --> 02:11:14,241
Oh, yes. Entirely.

1033
02:11:14,492 --> 02:11:17,619
Let me see that hat
thing, or whatever it is.

1034
02:11:17,912 --> 02:11:19,955
Fascinating gear
they wear.

1035
02:11:20,206 --> 02:11:22,499
How do you think I would
look in this, Harry?

1036
02:11:22,667 --> 02:11:26,169
- Damn ridiculous, sir.
- Here, you keep it.

1037
02:11:27,046 --> 02:11:31,216
What I'm trying to say is, I
don't think I'm fit for it.

1038
02:11:31,384 --> 02:11:34,261
Really? What do you
think, Dryden?

1039
02:11:35,304 --> 02:11:39,891
Before he did it, sir, I'd
have said it couldn't be done.

1040
02:11:40,226 --> 02:11:43,228
- Brighton?
- I know what he thinks.

1041
02:11:44,397 --> 02:11:47,732
I think you should recommend
a decoration, sir.

1042
02:11:48,067 --> 02:11:51,027
I don't think it matters
what his motives were.

1043
02:11:51,195 --> 02:11:54,322
It was a brilliant
bit of soldiering.

1044
02:11:55,866 --> 02:11:57,784
- Mr. Perkins!
- Sir!

1045
02:11:57,952 --> 02:12:00,579
Let's have
a drink, gentlemen.

1046
02:12:04,625 --> 02:12:08,086
- You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?
- Yes, sir.

1047
02:12:08,254 --> 02:12:12,591
- What do you think about it?
- Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done, sir.

1048
02:12:12,758 --> 02:12:15,802
- Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
- Sir!

1049
02:12:21,517 --> 02:12:23,101
Come on, then.

1050
02:12:26,731 --> 02:12:28,523
You're a clever
man, sir.

1051
02:12:28,816 --> 02:12:32,444
No, but I know a good
thing when I see one.

1052
02:12:32,695 --> 02:12:35,405
That's fair, surely.

1053
02:12:55,926 --> 02:12:58,470
Look here, now. If I am
going to break through

1054
02:12:58,471 --> 02:13:01,014
to Jerusalem, I must
concentrate, not dissipate.

1055
02:13:01,265 --> 02:13:03,558
- Clausewitz.
- You know better?

1056
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:25,997
I fight like Clausewitz,
then you fight like Saxe.

1057
02:13:26,165 --> 02:13:28,583
We should do very well
indeed, shouldn't we?

1058
02:14:05,162 --> 02:14:07,580
Easy, gentlemen, please.

1059
02:14:08,791 --> 02:14:11,000
- Will you give us something to drink?
- Of course, sir.

1060
02:14:11,502 --> 02:14:15,088
I'm here at the invitation
of Major Lawrence.

1061
02:14:15,715 --> 02:14:17,048
Tracy.

1062
02:14:18,926 --> 02:14:20,802
Shall we go outside?

1063
02:14:31,939 --> 02:14:35,066
So you hold bound
the Turkish desert army?

1064
02:14:35,234 --> 02:14:36,568
Yes.

1065
02:14:36,736 --> 02:14:39,070
With 1000 Arabs?

1066
02:14:40,156 --> 02:14:43,324
1000 Arabs means
1000 knives.

1067
02:14:43,492 --> 02:14:45,493
Delivered anywhere,
day or night.

1068
02:14:46,036 --> 02:14:47,704
It means 1000 camels.

1069
02:14:47,997 --> 02:14:52,250
That means 1000 packs of high
explosives and 1000 crack rifles.

1070
02:14:52,793 --> 02:14:56,588
We can cross Arabia while Johnny
Turk is still turning round.

1071
02:14:57,173 --> 02:14:59,132
I'll smash his railways.

1072
02:14:59,300 --> 02:15:01,843
And while he's mending them,
I'll smash them somewhere else.

1073
02:15:02,094 --> 02:15:04,888
In 13 weeks I can
have Arabia in chaos.

1074
02:15:05,139 --> 02:15:07,515
You are going back, then?

1075
02:15:10,269 --> 02:15:11,603
Yes.

1076
02:15:11,979 --> 02:15:14,314
Of course
I'm going back.

1077
02:15:18,652 --> 02:15:21,112
Hm. Well, if we can
see it, so can the Turk.

1078
02:15:21,363 --> 02:15:25,533
If he finds he's using four divisions
to fend off a handful of bandits,

1079
02:15:25,701 --> 02:15:27,035
he'll withdraw.

1080
02:15:27,203 --> 02:15:29,996
He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.

1081
02:15:30,164 --> 02:15:32,707
If he gets out now, he knows
he'll never get back again.

1082
02:15:32,958 --> 02:15:35,460
- I wonder who will.
- No one will.

1083
02:15:36,086 --> 02:15:38,296
Arabia's
for the Arabs now.

1084
02:15:44,303 --> 02:15:46,638
That's what I've
told them anyway.

1085
02:15:47,097 --> 02:15:48,932
That's what they think.

1086
02:15:49,391 --> 02:15:52,644
- That's why they're fighting.
- Oh, surely.

1087
02:15:55,606 --> 02:15:57,899
They've only one suspicion.

1088
02:15:58,317 --> 02:16:02,695
That we'll let them drive the Turks
out and then move in ourselves.

1089
02:16:02,947 --> 02:16:07,283
I've told them that that's false,
that we have no ambitions in Arabia.

1090
02:16:07,451 --> 02:16:08,785
Have we?

1091
02:16:08,953 --> 02:16:11,454
I'm not a politician, thank God.

1092
02:16:11,622 --> 02:16:14,749
Have we any ambition
in Arabia, Dryden?

1093
02:16:15,709 --> 02:16:18,002
Difficult question, sir.

1094
02:16:20,005 --> 02:16:23,842
I want to know, sir, if I can
tell them in your name

1095
02:16:24,009 --> 02:16:27,387
that we've no
ambitions in Arabia.

1096
02:16:28,472 --> 02:16:29,973
Certainly.

1097
02:16:47,491 --> 02:16:50,827
2000 small arms, not
enough. I need five.

1098
02:16:50,995 --> 02:16:52,328
Right.

1099
02:16:52,580 --> 02:16:55,290
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.
They don't like paper.

1100
02:16:55,457 --> 02:16:56,791
Right.

1101
02:16:56,959 --> 02:17:00,378
- Instructors for the Lewis guns.
- Right.

1102
02:17:00,546 --> 02:17:02,130
More money.

1103
02:17:02,423 --> 02:17:05,675
- How much more?
- 25,000 now. A lot more later.

1104
02:17:05,843 --> 02:17:08,595
- Dryden?
- It can be done, sir.

1105
02:17:08,762 --> 02:17:11,639
A couple of
armoured cars.

1106
02:17:11,807 --> 02:17:13,182
Right.

1107
02:17:13,893 --> 02:17:15,476
Field artillery.

1108
02:17:17,646 --> 02:17:19,022
Right.

1109
02:17:21,942 --> 02:17:24,277
I'm going to give you every blessed
thing I can, Major Lawrence,

1110
02:17:24,445 --> 02:17:27,405
because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations and thank you.

1111
02:17:27,573 --> 02:17:30,283
Thank you for your
hospitality, gentlemen.

1112
02:18:05,945 --> 02:18:07,820
Congratulations!

1113
02:18:18,123 --> 02:18:21,250
Are you really going to
give them artillery, sir?

1114
02:18:21,418 --> 02:18:23,294
I was wondering
that, sir.

1115
02:18:23,462 --> 02:18:25,672
Might be deuced difficult
to get it back again.

1116
02:18:25,923 --> 02:18:29,509
Give them artillery and
you've made them independent.

1117
02:18:29,677 --> 02:18:31,636
Then I can't give
them artillery, can I?

1118
02:18:31,887 --> 02:18:33,805
- For you to say, sir.
- No, it's not.

1119
02:18:34,056 --> 02:18:36,849
I've got orders to
obey, thank God.

1120
02:18:37,017 --> 02:18:38,977
Not like that
poor devil.

1121
02:18:39,478 --> 02:18:41,104
He's riding
the whirlwind.

1122
02:18:41,271 --> 02:18:43,481
Let's hope we're not.

1123
02:24:07,222 --> 02:24:10,433
Excuse me, friend. Who
do these bags belong to?

1124
02:24:10,934 --> 02:24:12,268
To Prince Feisal.

1125
02:24:12,436 --> 02:24:14,270
You're not Prince Feisal
by any chance?

1126
02:24:14,438 --> 02:24:16,856
- No.
- You know him though?

1127
02:24:17,024 --> 02:24:20,484
He is my master.
I am his servant.

1128
02:24:22,529 --> 02:24:24,989
Um, can you read?

1129
02:24:33,665 --> 02:24:35,917
The <i>Chicago Courier</i> is
my own particular paper,

1130
02:24:35,918 --> 02:24:38,169
but my work is syndicated
throughout America.

1131
02:24:38,420 --> 02:24:41,964
I understood so from
your letter, Mr. Bentley.

1132
02:24:55,979 --> 02:24:57,313
Now...

1133
02:24:58,523 --> 02:25:02,526
- Where can I find Major Lawrence?
- Is that what you have come for?

1134
02:25:02,694 --> 02:25:04,820
Not altogether, sir, no.

1135
02:25:05,113 --> 02:25:09,492
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.

1136
02:25:09,659 --> 02:25:12,703
That's what I meant, sir.
Where can I find your army?

1137
02:25:12,871 --> 02:25:14,205
I don't know.

1138
02:25:14,873 --> 02:25:17,541
- Last week they were near El Ghira.
- Ghira?

1139
02:25:17,793 --> 02:25:21,629
Oh, yes, I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?

1140
02:25:22,589 --> 02:25:25,174
- I've never tried.
- Take a mule.

1141
02:25:25,759 --> 02:25:27,843
Avoid Mellaha,
the Turks are there.

1142
02:25:28,261 --> 02:25:31,013
In Mellaha now?
They move fast.

1143
02:25:31,181 --> 02:25:32,515
They do.

1144
02:25:32,682 --> 02:25:35,768
But not so fast as
we do, you will find.

1145
02:25:36,103 --> 02:25:37,561
Myself...

1146
02:25:38,188 --> 02:25:40,147
I am going to Cairo.

1147
02:25:40,315 --> 02:25:42,358
- As you know.
- Yes.

1148
02:25:42,526 --> 02:25:45,027
There's work for me
there of a different kind.

1149
02:25:45,487 --> 02:25:46,821
Yes.

1150
02:25:50,367 --> 02:25:52,743
I understand you've
been given no artillery.

1151
02:25:53,203 --> 02:25:55,788
- That is so.
- You're handicapped?

1152
02:25:55,956 --> 02:25:58,165
It restricts us
to small things.

1153
02:25:58,333 --> 02:25:59,667
It's intended to.

1154
02:26:02,212 --> 02:26:03,838
Do you know
General Allenby?

1155
02:26:04,840 --> 02:26:08,300
Watch out for Allenby.
He's a slim customer.

1156
02:26:08,593 --> 02:26:11,303
- Excuse me?
- A clever man.

1157
02:26:11,555 --> 02:26:14,473
Slim customer.
It's very good.

1158
02:26:14,724 --> 02:26:19,311
I'll certainly watch out for him. You're
being very sympathetic, Mr. Bentley.

1159
02:26:19,563 --> 02:26:23,107
Your Highness, we Americans
were once a colonial people,

1160
02:26:23,275 --> 02:26:25,734
and we naturally feel
sympathetic to any people

1161
02:26:25,902 --> 02:26:28,154
anywhere who are struggling
for their freedom.

1162
02:26:28,321 --> 02:26:30,531
Very gratifying.

1163
02:26:33,285 --> 02:26:37,663
Also, my interests are the same
as yours. You want your story told.

1164
02:26:37,831 --> 02:26:40,124
I badly want a story to tell.

1165
02:26:40,375 --> 02:26:44,128
Ah, now you are talking
turkey, are you not?

1166
02:26:44,796 --> 02:26:47,715
Well, Mr. Bentley, I will give
you a guide and a letter.

1167
02:26:47,883 --> 02:26:49,842
And before I leave here,

1168
02:26:50,093 --> 02:26:52,470
ah, which must be presently,

1169
02:26:52,637 --> 02:26:56,182
I will have some facts and
figures put on paper for you.

1170
02:26:57,934 --> 02:27:01,395
You know, of course, that we are
destroying the Turkish railways.

1171
02:27:01,563 --> 02:27:02,897
I do, sir.

1172
02:27:03,064 --> 02:27:05,774
Major Lawrence is in
charge of all this, is he?

1173
02:27:05,942 --> 02:27:08,486
My army is made
up of tribes.

1174
02:27:08,653 --> 02:27:11,697
The tribes are led
by the tribal leaders.

1175
02:27:11,865 --> 02:27:15,075
Well, your people do think very
highly of Major Lawrence, though?

1176
02:27:15,243 --> 02:27:18,287
Oh, yes. And the rightly.

1177
02:27:18,914 --> 02:27:22,249
In this country, Mr. Bentley...

1178
02:27:23,084 --> 02:27:26,545
the man who gives victory
in battle is prized

1179
02:27:26,713 --> 02:27:29,340
beyond every other man.

1180
02:27:30,050 --> 02:27:33,219
One figure I can give
you from my head,

1181
02:27:33,386 --> 02:27:37,056
because it never
leaves my head.

1182
02:27:37,557 --> 02:27:41,602
Since starting this campaign
four months ago, we have lost...

1183
02:27:42,562 --> 02:27:44,980
37 wounded...

1184
02:27:47,526 --> 02:27:50,861
156 dead.

1185
02:27:52,572 --> 02:27:57,409
You remark the disproportion
between our dead and wounded.

1186
02:27:57,577 --> 02:27:58,911
Yeah.

1187
02:27:59,079 --> 02:28:00,496
Four times as many.

1188
02:28:00,664 --> 02:28:05,459
That's because those too badly wounded
to bring away, we ourselves kill.

1189
02:28:05,627 --> 02:28:07,836
We leave no wounded
for the Turks.

1190
02:28:08,004 --> 02:28:09,338
You mean...?

1191
02:28:09,506 --> 02:28:12,258
I mean we leave no
wounded for the Turks.

1192
02:28:12,759 --> 02:28:16,178
In their eyes, we are
not soldiers but rebels.

1193
02:28:16,346 --> 02:28:20,891
And rebels, wounded or whole, are
not protected by the Geneva Code

1194
02:28:21,059 --> 02:28:22,977
and are treated harshly.

1195
02:28:23,436 --> 02:28:24,770
How harshly?

1196
02:28:25,021 --> 02:28:27,940
More harshly than I
hope you can imagine.

1197
02:28:28,441 --> 02:28:29,775
I see.

1198
02:28:29,943 --> 02:28:33,195
Our own prisoners, Mr. Bentley, are
taken care of until the British

1199
02:28:33,363 --> 02:28:37,241
can relieve us of them,
according to the Code.

1200
02:28:37,409 --> 02:28:41,495
- I should like you to notice that.
- Yes, sir.

1201
02:28:42,497 --> 02:28:45,124
Is that the influence
of Major Lawrence?

1202
02:28:45,542 --> 02:28:47,001
Why should you
suppose so?

1203
02:28:47,168 --> 02:28:49,169
Well, it's just that
I heard in Cairo that

1204
02:28:49,337 --> 02:28:52,339
Major Lawrence has
a horror of bloodshed.

1205
02:28:52,507 --> 02:28:54,216
That is exactly so.

1206
02:28:54,384 --> 02:28:57,886
With Major Lawrence,
mercy is a passion.

1207
02:28:58,221 --> 02:29:01,140
With me, it is merely
good manners.

1208
02:29:01,308 --> 02:29:05,436
You may judge which
motive is the more reliable.

1209
02:29:06,062 --> 02:29:09,481
- And now, perhaps...
- Oh, sure, sure.

1210
02:29:13,570 --> 02:29:15,279
Thank you, sir.

1211
02:29:15,447 --> 02:29:17,197
Do you think you'd be able
to manage the letter...?

1212
02:29:17,449 --> 02:29:20,367
I'll do everything
I have said, Mr. Bentley,

1213
02:29:20,535 --> 02:29:24,079
if you will tell me truly
the nature of your interest

1214
02:29:24,331 --> 02:29:26,707
in my people and
Major Lawrence.

1215
02:29:28,627 --> 02:29:31,920
It's very simple, sir.
I'm looking for a hero.

1216
02:29:32,088 --> 02:29:34,673
Indeed. You do not
seem a romantic man.

1217
02:29:34,841 --> 02:29:36,175
Oh, no.

1218
02:29:36,343 --> 02:29:39,928
But certain influential men back home
believe that the time has come for America

1219
02:29:40,096 --> 02:29:42,890
to lend her weight to the patriotic
struggle against Germany.

1220
02:29:43,058 --> 02:29:45,059
And Turkey.

1221
02:29:45,352 --> 02:29:49,647
Now, I've been sent to find material which
will show our people that this war is...

1222
02:29:50,190 --> 02:29:52,650
- Enjoyable?
- Oh, hardly that, sir.

1223
02:29:52,817 --> 02:29:55,903
But to show it in its more
adventurous aspects.

1224
02:29:56,071 --> 02:29:59,657
You are looking for a figure who
will draw your country towards war.

1225
02:30:01,242 --> 02:30:03,077
All right. Yes.

1226
02:30:03,703 --> 02:30:05,329
Aurens is your man.

1227
02:30:45,036 --> 02:30:46,370
Stop!

1228
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:07,266
Stop it!

1229
02:31:08,059 --> 02:31:09,476
Stop it!

1230
02:31:17,652 --> 02:31:19,153
Come on, men!

1231
02:32:28,306 --> 02:32:29,640
Aurens!

1232
02:32:50,370 --> 02:32:52,371
Good, good, good!

1233
02:33:38,710 --> 02:33:43,505
Jiminy! Never seen a man
killed with a sword before.

1234
02:33:43,798 --> 02:33:46,008
Why don't you
take a picture?

1235
02:33:46,342 --> 02:33:47,676
Wish I had.

1236
02:33:51,931 --> 02:33:54,141
How is it with
thee, Aurens?

1237
02:33:56,352 --> 02:33:58,228
- Am I in this?
- Huh?

1238
02:33:58,396 --> 02:34:00,314
Did you take
his picture?

1239
02:34:00,481 --> 02:34:01,815
Yeah.

1240
02:34:06,029 --> 02:34:10,198
You are using up your
nine lives very quickly.

1241
02:34:12,702 --> 02:34:14,912
Charming company you keep.

1242
02:34:15,079 --> 02:34:16,413
Auda?

1243
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:22,085
He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks
these things will steal his virtue.

1244
02:34:22,462 --> 02:34:24,504
He thinks you're
a kind of thief.

1245
02:34:24,756 --> 02:34:26,882
It's all right if I
take your picture?

1246
02:34:27,467 --> 02:34:29,009
- All right.
- Okay.

1247
02:34:29,177 --> 02:34:30,636
Just walk.

1248
02:34:43,107 --> 02:34:47,069
Aurens! Aurens!
Aurens! Aurens!

1249
02:34:47,236 --> 02:34:51,406
Aurens! Aurens!
Aurens! Aurens!

1250
02:34:51,574 --> 02:34:54,201
Aurens! Aurens! Aurens!

1251
02:35:30,863 --> 02:35:32,990
Major Lawrence!

1252
02:35:33,616 --> 02:35:36,326
Yes, sir, that's my baby.

1253
02:35:44,335 --> 02:35:46,962
This looting
has got to stop!

1254
02:35:47,213 --> 02:35:48,547
It is customary.

1255
02:35:48,798 --> 02:35:52,384
It's theft. And theft
makes thieves.

1256
02:35:52,635 --> 02:35:54,886
I would not say
that to Auda.

1257
02:35:55,388 --> 02:35:58,140
- It is their payment, colonel.
- Payment.

1258
02:35:58,391 --> 02:36:01,143
Truly. Are not British
soldiers paid?

1259
02:36:02,061 --> 02:36:03,478
They don't go home
when they've been paid.

1260
02:36:03,646 --> 02:36:05,355
They are not free to.

1261
02:36:10,153 --> 02:36:14,281
Well, there's another lot
you've seen the last of.

1262
02:36:14,532 --> 02:36:16,158
They'll come back.

1263
02:36:16,993 --> 02:36:19,953
He says they'll come
back. Will they?

1264
02:36:20,204 --> 02:36:22,414
Not this year,
Aurens.

1265
02:36:23,124 --> 02:36:27,544
Look, Lawrence, how many men do
you think you'll have left? 200?

1266
02:36:27,795 --> 02:36:30,547
- Less.
- Well, then?

1267
02:36:30,923 --> 02:36:33,258
I said, they'll
come back.

1268
02:36:33,801 --> 02:36:35,135
You badly hurt?

1269
02:36:36,679 --> 02:36:38,513
Not hurt at all.

1270
02:36:38,681 --> 02:36:42,851
Didn't you know? They can only
kill me with a golden bullet.

1271
02:36:58,576 --> 02:37:02,454
It is for children. I have
set myself to learn again.

1272
02:37:02,872 --> 02:37:06,416
- What are you learning from this?
- Politics.

1273
02:37:07,126 --> 02:37:11,588
You gonna be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?

1274
02:37:12,256 --> 02:37:14,549
I will tell you that
when I have a country.

1275
02:37:16,969 --> 02:37:18,303
Did I answer well?

1276
02:37:18,471 --> 02:37:22,682
You answered without saying
anything. That's politics.

1277
02:37:23,935 --> 02:37:25,644
You learn quickly.

1278
02:37:26,938 --> 02:37:29,981
- I have a good teacher.
- Yeah.

1279
02:37:31,734 --> 02:37:33,110
Yeah.

1280
02:37:40,868 --> 02:37:42,744
- How's your hurt?
- Fine.

1281
02:37:42,912 --> 02:37:47,749
Before I return to the fleshpots,
which I shall be very glad to do,

1282
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:51,044
may I put two questions
to you, straight?

1283
02:37:51,295 --> 02:37:54,548
I'd be interested to hear you put
a question straight, Mr. Bentley.

1284
02:37:54,715 --> 02:37:56,049
One.

1285
02:37:56,509 --> 02:38:00,428
What, in your opinion, do these
people hope to gain from this war?

1286
02:38:00,721 --> 02:38:03,140
They hope to
gain their freedom.

1287
02:38:04,183 --> 02:38:05,517
Freedom.

1288
02:38:06,769 --> 02:38:09,604
"They hope to gain their freedom."

1289
02:38:09,856 --> 02:38:13,525
- There's one born every minute.
- They're going to get it, Mr. Bentley.

1290
02:38:14,277 --> 02:38:16,486
I'm going to give it to them.

1291
02:38:18,156 --> 02:38:23,994
- The second question?
- Well, I was going to ask, um...

1292
02:38:24,495 --> 02:38:28,456
What is it, Major Lawrence, that
attracts you personally to the desert?

1293
02:38:30,459 --> 02:38:32,544
It's clean.

1294
02:38:35,339 --> 02:38:36,923
Well, now...

1295
02:38:37,758 --> 02:38:39,926
that's a very illuminating answer.

1296
02:38:40,261 --> 02:38:41,928
May I...

1297
02:38:42,555 --> 02:38:45,056
take one farewell picture?

1298
02:38:45,850 --> 02:38:48,935
I gave Math Budad
two lamps for it.

1299
02:38:49,187 --> 02:38:52,147
One clock for two lamps.

1300
02:38:52,523 --> 02:38:53,857
A fair bargain.

1301
02:38:54,108 --> 02:38:56,735
Fair? I robbed him.

1302
02:39:08,164 --> 02:39:09,664
Trash.

1303
02:39:10,791 --> 02:39:13,251
I must find
something honourable.

1304
02:39:13,502 --> 02:39:15,086
Honourable?

1305
02:39:15,671 --> 02:39:19,466
Yes. The year is
running out, Brighton.

1306
02:39:23,846 --> 02:39:26,848
I must find something honourable.

1307
02:41:58,376 --> 02:42:00,585
Now you may
blow up my train.

1308
02:42:00,836 --> 02:42:02,545
And what will
you do now?

1309
02:42:02,797 --> 02:42:07,342
Now I go home.
They will carry my toys.

1310
02:42:08,135 --> 02:42:10,136
They will carry my
toys too, do you see?

1311
02:42:10,513 --> 02:42:13,598
Major Lawrence will
campaign this winter.

1312
02:42:13,849 --> 02:42:17,268
But you got what you wanted,
so you're going home, is that it?

1313
02:42:17,436 --> 02:42:22,065
Of course. When Aurens has got
what he wants, he will go home.

1314
02:42:22,316 --> 02:42:24,859
When you've got what
you want, you will go home.

1315
02:42:25,111 --> 02:42:26,736
Oh, no, I shan't, Auda.

1316
02:42:27,530 --> 02:42:28,947
Then you are a fool.

1317
02:42:29,615 --> 02:42:32,617
Maybe. But I am not a deserter.

1318
02:42:33,702 --> 02:42:35,912
Give thanks to God, Brighton,

1319
02:42:36,163 --> 02:42:39,249
that when he made you a fool,
he gave you a fool's face.

1320
02:42:40,501 --> 02:42:42,585
You are an impudent rascal.

1321
02:42:44,130 --> 02:42:48,425
I must go, Aurens, before I
soil myself with a fool's blood.

1322
02:42:58,853 --> 02:43:00,562
Like talking to a brick wall.

1323
02:43:09,238 --> 02:43:11,906
So, what will you do now?
What can you do?

1324
02:43:12,575 --> 02:43:14,284
I'll go north.

1325
02:43:15,619 --> 02:43:17,454
That's what Allenby
wants, isn't it?

1326
02:43:17,705 --> 02:43:21,791
Allenby wanted the Arab
army behind Deraa.

1327
02:43:22,042 --> 02:43:24,294
Then that's where I'll take it.

1328
02:43:25,296 --> 02:43:30,091
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be
in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.

1329
02:43:30,259 --> 02:43:31,593
Won't we?

1330
02:44:03,792 --> 02:44:05,126
Train, Farraj.

1331
02:44:06,170 --> 02:44:07,670
Yeah, Aurens.

1332
02:44:36,909 --> 02:44:38,743
Hide yourself, my friend.

1333
02:44:47,962 --> 02:44:49,379
Detonator.

1334
02:45:02,893 --> 02:45:04,644
All right, fetch another.

1335
02:45:04,812 --> 02:45:08,565
- Pardon, Aurens. I put...
- There's plenty of time. Fetch another.

1336
02:45:14,029 --> 02:45:15,446
Farraj?

1337
02:45:16,615 --> 02:45:18,533
Farraj!

1338
02:45:25,708 --> 02:45:28,793
- What happened?
- Detonator. A detonator!

1339
02:45:42,308 --> 02:45:44,767
He cannot ride,
Aurens. Look.

1340
02:45:54,278 --> 02:45:57,155
If they take him alive, you
know what they'll do to him.

1341
02:46:09,543 --> 02:46:11,961
Daud will be angry with you.

1342
02:46:13,005 --> 02:46:14,881
Salute him for me.

1343
02:46:34,652 --> 02:46:36,361
What will you do now?

1344
02:46:37,780 --> 02:46:39,280
Go north.

1345
02:46:39,531 --> 02:46:40,948
With twenty?

1346
02:46:41,825 --> 02:46:44,285
What would you
recommend me to do, Ali?

1347
02:46:46,038 --> 02:46:48,039
What would you recommend?

1348
02:46:53,003 --> 02:46:55,380
Well, he hasn't one-tenth
so many men, sir.

1349
02:46:55,547 --> 02:46:57,423
He's lied, in fact.

1350
02:46:58,759 --> 02:47:02,470
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to
have done anything he hasn't done.

1351
02:47:02,721 --> 02:47:05,348
Then there is an
Arab north army.

1352
02:47:06,892 --> 02:47:11,396
- No, sir, he has lied about that.
- Any idea why?

1353
02:47:11,772 --> 02:47:15,775
- It's his army, I suppose.
- It's Prince Feisal's army.

1354
02:47:17,194 --> 02:47:19,737
Do you think he's
gone native, Harry?

1355
02:47:21,073 --> 02:47:22,657
No.

1356
02:47:23,701 --> 02:47:27,453
He would if he
could, I think.

1357
02:47:29,206 --> 02:47:32,667
- Not my line of country, this, sir.
- It doesn't matter. I'm just curious.

1358
02:47:33,377 --> 02:47:35,628
What matters is
I believed it.

1359
02:47:35,879 --> 02:47:37,588
The Turks believe it.

1360
02:47:37,840 --> 02:47:41,217
They are offering
20,000 pounds for him.

1361
02:47:43,178 --> 02:47:44,971
Good heavens.

1362
02:47:45,431 --> 02:47:47,265
Shouldn't say he had
long to live, would you?

1363
02:47:47,433 --> 02:47:49,183
Well, whatever else,
sir, he's a brave man...

1364
02:47:49,351 --> 02:47:53,730
Surely, surely. If he's still going north
with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.

1365
02:47:54,940 --> 02:47:57,692
I wonder if they'd
offer that much for me.

1366
02:47:59,403 --> 02:48:03,531
What about next year?
Will they still come back?

1367
02:48:03,782 --> 02:48:05,742
I wouldn't be surprised.

1368
02:48:05,993 --> 02:48:09,620
- They think he's a kind of prophet.
- They do or he does?

1369
02:48:25,220 --> 02:48:27,805
- Now may I speak?
- Yes.

1370
02:48:28,432 --> 02:48:31,601
Aurens, one more failure
and you will find yourself alone.

1371
02:48:33,020 --> 02:48:36,522
- I do not include myself.
- I do not include the others.

1372
02:48:36,774 --> 02:48:38,983
So say they love you.

1373
02:48:39,401 --> 02:48:41,944
The more reason to
be thrifty with them.

1374
02:48:42,112 --> 02:48:45,281
Give them something to do
that can be done. But you, no.

1375
02:48:45,449 --> 02:48:47,617
They must move mountains for
you, they must walk on water.

1376
02:48:47,868 --> 02:48:51,078
That's right. That's right.

1377
02:48:51,705 --> 02:48:54,207
Who are you to know
what can be done?

1378
02:48:54,666 --> 02:48:56,480
If we'd done what you
thought could be done,

1379
02:48:56,481 --> 02:48:58,294
we'd be back in Yenbo
now and nowhere.

1380
02:48:58,879 --> 02:49:03,341
Whatever I ask them to do can be done.
That's all. They know that if you don't.

1381
02:49:05,427 --> 02:49:08,387
Do you think I'm just anybody, Ali?

1382
02:49:08,889 --> 02:49:10,264
Do you?

1383
02:49:13,477 --> 02:49:16,813
My friends, who will
walk on water with me?

1384
02:49:20,275 --> 02:49:24,695
- Who will come with me into Deraa?
- Deraa is garrisoned.

1385
02:49:24,863 --> 02:49:26,948
Will you take 20 against 2000?

1386
02:49:27,199 --> 02:49:30,910
- I'll go by myself if I have to.
- Why?

1387
02:49:31,161 --> 02:49:33,037
Because I told the
English generals

1388
02:49:33,288 --> 02:49:36,916
the Arab revolt would be in Deraa
when they'd be in Jerusalem.

1389
02:49:37,376 --> 02:49:39,460
Or perhaps you are here...

1390
02:49:40,087 --> 02:49:42,046
for the English generals.

1391
02:49:44,091 --> 02:49:45,758
Who says this?

1392
02:49:46,009 --> 02:49:47,385
Rumour.

1393
02:49:48,679 --> 02:49:51,180
That is not an argument.

1394
02:49:51,431 --> 02:49:53,683
Oh, argument.

1395
02:49:53,851 --> 02:49:57,228
This afternoon I will take
the Arab revolt into Deraa

1396
02:49:57,479 --> 02:49:59,522
while the Arabs argue.

1397
02:49:59,690 --> 02:50:01,399
Aurens.

1398
02:50:01,817 --> 02:50:04,944
Can you pass for an Arab
in an Arab town?

1399
02:50:05,320 --> 02:50:09,115
Yes. If one of you would lend
me some dirty clothes.

1400
02:50:18,250 --> 02:50:19,584
It's madness.

1401
02:50:23,046 --> 02:50:24,839
What are you looking for?

1402
02:50:25,090 --> 02:50:27,550
Some way to
announce myself.

1403
02:50:27,801 --> 02:50:29,719
Be patient with him, God.

1404
02:50:43,150 --> 02:50:44,817
Do you not see how
they look at you? Come.

1405
02:50:44,985 --> 02:50:47,361
Peace, Ali, I am invisible.

1406
02:50:47,529 --> 02:50:48,863
Halt!

1407
02:50:49,031 --> 02:50:50,406
Walk on.

1408
02:50:50,574 --> 02:50:52,450
- Halt!
- Walk on.

1409
02:50:53,577 --> 02:50:55,786
You and you.

1410
02:51:10,218 --> 02:51:11,552
You.

1411
02:52:36,638 --> 02:52:37,972
You.

1412
02:52:54,531 --> 02:52:56,532
You have blue eyes.

1413
02:52:57,451 --> 02:53:01,662
- I say you have blue eyes.
- Yes, effendi.

1414
02:53:01,913 --> 02:53:05,166
- Are you Circassian?
- Yes, effendi.

1415
02:53:06,084 --> 02:53:07,626
How old are you?

1416
02:53:07,878 --> 02:53:10,963
Twenty-seven, effendi.

1417
02:53:11,131 --> 02:53:13,007
I think.

1418
02:53:13,258 --> 02:53:17,803
You look older. You have
had a lot of experience.

1419
02:53:19,056 --> 02:53:21,140
It's an interesting face.

1420
02:53:25,812 --> 02:53:28,230
I am surrounded by cattle.

1421
02:53:28,899 --> 02:53:32,610
He wouldn't know an interesting
face from a sow's belly.

1422
02:53:33,612 --> 02:53:37,656
I have been in Deraa now
for three and a half years.

1423
02:53:37,824 --> 02:53:42,244
If they posted me to the dark side
of the moon, I could not be more...

1424
02:53:42,412 --> 02:53:44,288
isolated.

1425
02:53:46,166 --> 02:53:48,793
You haven't the least idea
what I'm talking about, have you?

1426
02:53:49,044 --> 02:53:50,753
No, effendi.

1427
02:53:53,340 --> 02:53:54,715
Have you?

1428
02:53:55,884 --> 02:53:57,218
No.

1429
02:53:57,928 --> 02:53:59,762
That would be too...

1430
02:54:00,013 --> 02:54:01,597
lucky.

1431
02:54:26,081 --> 02:54:27,873
Where did you get that?

1432
02:54:28,041 --> 02:54:33,921
- Oh, it's old, effendi.
- No, no, this is recent.

1433
02:54:36,007 --> 02:54:38,217
- You are a deserter.
- No, effendi.

1434
02:54:38,468 --> 02:54:40,386
Yes, you are a deserter.

1435
02:54:41,471 --> 02:54:43,722
But from which army?

1436
02:54:46,226 --> 02:54:48,519
Not that it matters at all.

1437
02:54:48,812 --> 02:54:51,188
A man cannot be always in uniform.

1438
02:55:02,659 --> 02:55:04,618
Your skin is very fair.

1439
02:55:23,471 --> 02:55:24,805
Beat him.

1440
02:56:59,359 --> 02:57:00,734
To me!

1441
02:59:03,233 --> 02:59:04,817
Sleep.

1442
02:59:06,569 --> 02:59:08,153
Sleep.

1443
02:59:19,916 --> 02:59:21,291
Eat.

1444
02:59:27,048 --> 02:59:28,382
Eat.

1445
02:59:32,220 --> 02:59:35,055
You have a body,
like other men.

1446
02:59:43,314 --> 02:59:44,648
Good.

1447
02:59:45,775 --> 02:59:47,568
Then sleep.

1448
03:00:01,040 --> 03:00:02,374
Better?

1449
03:00:02,959 --> 03:00:05,711
Much better.
You were right.

1450
03:00:05,962 --> 03:00:08,130
Rest, rest.
Can you not learn?

1451
03:00:09,090 --> 03:00:11,133
Oh, I've learned all right.

1452
03:00:16,931 --> 03:00:18,640
I'm going, Ali.

1453
03:00:19,726 --> 03:00:21,810
- Why?
- Why?

1454
03:00:23,062 --> 03:00:24,438
Heavens.

1455
03:00:24,606 --> 03:00:25,939
Why?

1456
03:00:26,858 --> 03:00:29,067
I've come to the end
of myself, I suppose.

1457
03:00:29,319 --> 03:00:31,361
And the end of
the Arab revolt?

1458
03:00:31,613 --> 03:00:34,740
I'm not the Arab revolt,
Ali. I'm not even Arab.

1459
03:00:34,991 --> 03:00:38,035
A man can be whatever
he wants. You said.

1460
03:00:38,286 --> 03:00:41,288
I'm sorry.
I thought it was true.

1461
03:00:41,539 --> 03:00:43,457
You proved it.

1462
03:00:43,708 --> 03:00:45,876
Look, Ali. Look.

1463
03:00:46,127 --> 03:00:49,922
That's me. What colour
is it? That's me.

1464
03:00:50,715 --> 03:00:53,050
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

1465
03:00:53,218 --> 03:00:55,886
A man can do whatever
he wants. You said.

1466
03:00:57,639 --> 03:00:59,139
He can...

1467
03:00:59,307 --> 03:01:02,226
but he can't want
what he wants.

1468
03:01:03,144 --> 03:01:06,396
This is the stuff that
decides what he wants.

1469
03:01:09,192 --> 03:01:12,986
You may as well know. I
would've told them anything.

1470
03:01:13,238 --> 03:01:17,157
I would've told them who I am. I
would've told them where you were.

1471
03:01:17,408 --> 03:01:20,202
- I tried to.
- So would any man.

1472
03:01:20,370 --> 03:01:23,914
Well, any man
is what I am.

1473
03:01:24,916 --> 03:01:28,919
And I'm going back to
Allenby to ask him for a job

1474
03:01:29,170 --> 03:01:31,213
that any man can do.

1475
03:01:31,506 --> 03:01:33,423
Allenby's in Jerusalem.

1476
03:01:33,675 --> 03:01:36,385
- I'll make easy stages.
- You?

1477
03:01:37,971 --> 03:01:41,431
Oh, yes. Easy stages.

1478
03:01:43,184 --> 03:01:47,729
Look, Ali, I think I see
a way of being just

1479
03:01:47,981 --> 03:01:49,565
ordinarily...

1480
03:01:50,233 --> 03:01:51,650
happy.

1481
03:01:55,488 --> 03:01:57,072
Can I take this?

1482
03:01:57,699 --> 03:01:59,616
It is not clean.

1483
03:01:59,867 --> 03:02:02,911
No, but it's warm.

1484
03:02:03,246 --> 03:02:04,580
And these...

1485
03:02:04,831 --> 03:02:08,750
having led them here,
have you no care for them?

1486
03:02:10,253 --> 03:02:15,465
You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.

1487
03:02:17,677 --> 03:02:19,886
And let me go back to mine.

1488
03:02:49,042 --> 03:02:52,127
- I say, don't forget those form fives.
- All right.

1489
03:02:55,423 --> 03:02:56,923
Hey.

1490
03:02:58,009 --> 03:02:59,843
- Mind if I join you?
- Oh.

1491
03:03:00,678 --> 03:03:02,346
Honoured, sir.

1492
03:03:04,682 --> 03:03:07,976
- Good to be back.
- We heard you were, sir.

1493
03:03:08,561 --> 03:03:11,104
- What's doing out there?
- Where?

1494
03:03:11,356 --> 03:03:13,607
- Oh, Arabia?
- Well, yes, sir.

1495
03:03:13,858 --> 03:03:17,194
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?

1496
03:03:17,445 --> 03:03:19,905
We're settling in all right, sir.
We built a squash court.

1497
03:03:20,073 --> 03:03:21,531
Jolly good.

1498
03:03:22,367 --> 03:03:26,328
Well, I have to go up there.

1499
03:03:27,330 --> 03:03:29,790
It's borrowed.
Someone pinched mine.

1500
03:03:30,041 --> 03:03:31,750
Bloody wogs.

1501
03:03:33,169 --> 03:03:35,087
Yes, probably.

1502
03:03:35,797 --> 03:03:38,173
Jolly good about the squash court.

1503
03:03:40,927 --> 03:03:43,428
Lays it on a bit thick,
doesn't he?

1504
03:03:56,609 --> 03:03:57,943
Morning.

1505
03:03:58,111 --> 03:03:59,903
- Good morning, sir.
- Good to be back.

1506
03:04:00,154 --> 03:04:03,240
- I'll believe you, sir.
- No, really, it is.

1507
03:04:06,494 --> 03:04:07,828
Hello.

1508
03:04:08,454 --> 03:04:11,581
Morning. You're
to go right in.

1509
03:04:23,594 --> 03:04:25,053
Aurens.

1510
03:04:26,848 --> 03:04:29,391
Or is it Major Lawrence?

1511
03:04:30,059 --> 03:04:32,936
- Sir.
- Ah.

1512
03:04:37,233 --> 03:04:39,109
Well, general,
I will leave you.

1513
03:04:39,360 --> 03:04:42,237
Major Lawrence doubtless
has reports to make

1514
03:04:42,530 --> 03:04:46,324
about my people
and their weakness

1515
03:04:46,576 --> 03:04:51,371
and the need to keep them
weak in the British interest.

1516
03:04:53,875 --> 03:04:57,461
And the French interest too, of course.
We must not forget the French.

1517
03:04:57,628 --> 03:04:59,671
I told you, sir,
no such treaty exists.

1518
03:04:59,922 --> 03:05:04,426
Yes, general, you have lied most
bravely, but not convincingly.

1519
03:05:04,594 --> 03:05:06,678
I know this treaty
does exist.

1520
03:05:06,846 --> 03:05:08,805
Treaty, sir?

1521
03:05:10,975 --> 03:05:12,976
He does it better
than you, general.

1522
03:05:13,227 --> 03:05:16,521
But then, of course,
he is almost an Arab.

1523
03:05:30,703 --> 03:05:32,329
You really don't know?

1524
03:05:34,624 --> 03:05:36,625
Then what the devil's this?

1525
03:05:37,668 --> 03:05:41,588
It's my request for release
from Arabia, sir.

1526
03:05:41,756 --> 03:05:45,675
For what reason? Are you sure you haven't
heard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?

1527
03:05:45,843 --> 03:05:47,219
No.

1528
03:05:47,970 --> 03:05:51,139
- I can guess.
- Don't guess. Tell him.

1529
03:05:52,934 --> 03:05:54,351
Well, now...

1530
03:05:54,769 --> 03:05:57,813
Mr. Sykes is an
English civil servant.

1531
03:05:58,064 --> 03:06:01,191
Monsieur Picot is
a French civil servant.

1532
03:06:01,359 --> 03:06:05,570
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met,
and they agreed that after the war,

1533
03:06:05,822 --> 03:06:09,199
France and England should
share the Turkish Empire.

1534
03:06:09,450 --> 03:06:11,201
Including Arabia.

1535
03:06:11,452 --> 03:06:15,580
They signed an agreement,
not a treaty, sir.

1536
03:06:15,748 --> 03:06:18,875
An agreement
to that effect.

1537
03:06:19,502 --> 03:06:23,088
There may be honour among thieves,
but there's none in politicians.

1538
03:06:23,339 --> 03:06:26,091
And let's have no displays
of indignation.

1539
03:06:26,342 --> 03:06:29,469
You may not have known, but
you certainly had suspicions.

1540
03:06:29,971 --> 03:06:33,348
If we've told lies,
you've told half-lies.

1541
03:06:33,516 --> 03:06:37,978
And a man who tells lies,
like me, merely hides the truth.

1542
03:06:38,229 --> 03:06:42,941
But a man who tells half-lies
has forgotten where he put it.

1543
03:06:43,526 --> 03:06:46,820
The truth is, I'm an ordinary man.

1544
03:06:47,321 --> 03:06:49,739
You might have told me that, Dryden.

1545
03:06:51,200 --> 03:06:53,201
And I want an ordinary job, sir.

1546
03:06:53,452 --> 03:06:55,787
That's my reason
for resigning.

1547
03:06:55,955 --> 03:06:58,748
It's personal.

1548
03:06:58,916 --> 03:07:01,126
- Personal?
- Yes, sir.

1549
03:07:01,377 --> 03:07:04,462
Personal? You're a
serving officer in the field.

1550
03:07:04,714 --> 03:07:08,091
And as it happens, a damned important one.
Personal? Are you mad?

1551
03:07:08,342 --> 03:07:11,553
No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.

1552
03:07:11,804 --> 03:07:13,847
That's my reason too.

1553
03:07:14,015 --> 03:07:19,102
Look, Lawrence, I'm making my big push
on Damascus the 16th of next month,

1554
03:07:19,270 --> 03:07:21,229
and you are part of it.

1555
03:07:21,731 --> 03:07:25,400
Can you understand that? You're
an important part of the big push!

1556
03:07:25,651 --> 03:07:29,529
I don't want to be part
of your big push!

1557
03:07:30,281 --> 03:07:32,365
What about your Arab friends?
What about them?

1558
03:07:32,533 --> 03:07:36,411
I have no Arab friends!
I don't want Arab friends!

1559
03:07:36,579 --> 03:07:38,830
What in hell do
you want, Lawrence?

1560
03:07:38,998 --> 03:07:44,127
I've told you, I just want my
ration of common humanity.

1561
03:07:44,378 --> 03:07:47,297
- Lawrence.
- Yes?

1562
03:07:50,009 --> 03:07:52,761
Nothing. Sorry
I interrupted, sir.

1563
03:07:53,012 --> 03:07:55,138
That's quite all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.

1564
03:07:55,389 --> 03:07:57,098
Thank you, sir.

1565
03:07:58,184 --> 03:08:00,393
Why don't we...?

1566
03:08:02,980 --> 03:08:04,814
There's blood
on your back.

1567
03:08:06,067 --> 03:08:09,194
- Do you want a doctor?
- No.

1568
03:08:10,363 --> 03:08:12,530
Tell me what happened.

1569
03:08:17,495 --> 03:08:19,621
Say, what goes
on in there?

1570
03:08:20,414 --> 03:08:22,374
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on!

1571
03:08:22,541 --> 03:08:26,044
- No, really. Nothing at all.
- Is the man in trouble?

1572
03:08:26,212 --> 03:08:30,173
I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.

1573
03:08:30,424 --> 03:08:32,259
Just let me know if the
man's in trouble. I've

1574
03:08:32,260 --> 03:08:34,094
got an interest in that man.
I've got a claim.

1575
03:08:34,261 --> 03:08:35,595
What claim?

1576
03:08:35,763 --> 03:08:37,973
You've read my stuff.
I've made that boy a hero.

1577
03:08:38,224 --> 03:08:40,934
When the war's over, that boy
can be anything he wants.

1578
03:08:41,185 --> 03:08:45,480
Yes. Well, at the moment he
wants to be somebody else.

1579
03:08:45,982 --> 03:08:48,817
Will you kindly
allow me to pass?

1580
03:08:49,402 --> 03:08:51,861
Walk away, Dryden,
walk away.

1581
03:08:52,113 --> 03:08:54,906
Always walking
away, aren't you?

1582
03:08:55,157 --> 03:08:56,741
Well, I'll tell you.

1583
03:08:56,909 --> 03:08:59,911
It's a little clash of temperament
that's going on in there.

1584
03:09:00,079 --> 03:09:02,998
Inevitably, one of
them's half-mad

1585
03:09:03,249 --> 03:09:06,001
and the other,
wholly unscrupulous.

1586
03:09:06,836 --> 03:09:09,879
I believe your name will
be a household word,

1587
03:09:10,381 --> 03:09:14,050
when you'd have to go to the war
museum to find who Allenby was.

1588
03:09:14,927 --> 03:09:17,804
You're the most extraordinary
man I ever met.

1589
03:09:18,431 --> 03:09:19,931
Leave me alone.

1590
03:09:20,182 --> 03:09:22,767
- Leave me alone.
- That's a feeble thing to say.

1591
03:09:22,935 --> 03:09:25,520
- I know I'm not ordinary.
- That's not what I'm saying.

1592
03:09:25,771 --> 03:09:28,523
All right,
I'm extraordinary.

1593
03:09:30,276 --> 03:09:31,609
What of it?

1594
03:09:31,986 --> 03:09:34,738
Not many people have
a destiny, Lawrence.

1595
03:09:34,905 --> 03:09:38,074
It's a terrible thing for a
man to flunk it if he has.

1596
03:09:38,242 --> 03:09:40,368
Are you speaking
from experience?

1597
03:09:40,661 --> 03:09:42,037
No.

1598
03:09:42,204 --> 03:09:44,080
You're guessing, then.

1599
03:09:45,207 --> 03:09:46,583
Suppose you're wrong.

1600
03:09:46,834 --> 03:09:49,919
Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.

1601
03:09:50,713 --> 03:09:53,673
- Yes. I said, yes.
- After all...

1602
03:09:56,260 --> 03:09:58,303
- The 16th?
- Can you do it?

1603
03:09:58,471 --> 03:10:00,555
I'll give you a lot of money.

1604
03:10:00,848 --> 03:10:03,683
- Artillery?
- I can't.

1605
03:10:04,894 --> 03:10:07,854
They won't be coming for
money, not the best of them.

1606
03:10:08,147 --> 03:10:10,356
They'll be coming for Damascus.

1607
03:10:11,442 --> 03:10:13,485
Which I'm going to give them.

1608
03:10:14,195 --> 03:10:15,987
That's all I want.

1609
03:10:17,031 --> 03:10:19,991
All you want is someone
holding down the Turkish Right.

1610
03:10:20,159 --> 03:10:24,454
But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.

1611
03:10:24,705 --> 03:10:27,874
And when we've
got it, we'll keep it.

1612
03:10:28,125 --> 03:10:30,543
You can tell the politicians
to burn their bit of paper now.

1613
03:10:30,711 --> 03:10:32,045
Fair enough.

1614
03:10:32,546 --> 03:10:35,465
Fair? What's fair
got to do with it?

1615
03:10:36,175 --> 03:10:38,093
It's going to happen.

1616
03:10:38,803 --> 03:10:40,887
I shall want quite
a lot of money.

1617
03:10:41,597 --> 03:10:43,306
All there is.

1618
03:10:43,808 --> 03:10:45,391
Not that much.

1619
03:10:48,687 --> 03:10:51,439
The best of them
won't come for money.

1620
03:10:53,359 --> 03:10:54,734
They'll come for me.

1621
03:11:13,170 --> 03:11:14,504
No pictures! You
take no pictures.

1622
03:11:14,755 --> 03:11:17,090
It's not for you, Sheik Auda,
it's for Major Lawrence.

1623
03:11:17,341 --> 03:11:21,553
He doesn't mind having his picture taken.
He doesn't mind at all.

1624
03:11:21,720 --> 03:11:23,972
Well, there's
only one Aurens.

1625
03:11:28,435 --> 03:11:31,104
Have you met Major Lawrence
since he's come back, sherif?

1626
03:11:31,272 --> 03:11:32,605
Yes.

1627
03:11:32,773 --> 03:11:35,191
- Changed, hasn't he?
- No.

1628
03:11:35,359 --> 03:11:38,236
Oh, I'd say he had.
Different man, I'd say.

1629
03:11:40,406 --> 03:11:42,866
Aurens! Aurens!

1630
03:11:43,033 --> 03:11:46,703
What did that Turkish
general do to him in Deraa?

1631
03:11:47,413 --> 03:11:52,167
He was the same man after Deraa.
The same man, humbled.

1632
03:11:53,878 --> 03:11:56,421
What did the English general
do to him in Jerusalem?

1633
03:11:56,672 --> 03:11:58,423
Search me.
Ask Aurens.

1634
03:11:58,591 --> 03:12:00,508
- I did.
- What did he say?

1635
03:12:00,759 --> 03:12:02,343
He laughed.

1636
03:12:02,845 --> 03:12:05,471
He told me to gather
the Harith here.

1637
03:12:06,056 --> 03:12:07,599
He offered me money.

1638
03:12:07,850 --> 03:12:09,434
Did you take it?

1639
03:12:10,227 --> 03:12:12,812
No. But many did.

1640
03:12:50,559 --> 03:12:53,645
- What is this?
- This is my bodyguard.

1641
03:12:54,313 --> 03:12:56,981
There is not a man there
without a price on his head.

1642
03:12:57,233 --> 03:13:00,860
- There's a price on my head too.
- But these are murderers.

1643
03:13:01,111 --> 03:13:03,071
You know, the sheiks
will hang these men.

1644
03:13:03,322 --> 03:13:05,114
These men are mine.

1645
03:13:05,616 --> 03:13:09,953
Aurens, these things know
nothing of the Arab revolt.

1646
03:13:10,287 --> 03:13:13,706
- You, Ghitan of Aleppo.
- Sherif?

1647
03:13:13,958 --> 03:13:16,918
- Where do we ride?
- Damascus, sherif.

1648
03:13:17,169 --> 03:13:19,087
Aye, but for what?

1649
03:13:19,255 --> 03:13:21,464
Sherif, for Aurens.

1650
03:13:24,551 --> 03:13:27,887
- You have bought these things.
- I bought half the men here, Ali.

1651
03:13:28,138 --> 03:13:30,890
That is different. These
are not ordinary men.

1652
03:13:31,141 --> 03:13:34,102
I don't want
ordinary men. Hut!

1653
03:13:38,107 --> 03:13:39,941
Damascus!

1654
03:13:40,192 --> 03:13:42,277
Damascus! Damascus!

1655
03:13:42,528 --> 03:13:45,571
Damascus! Damascus!

1656
03:14:19,440 --> 03:14:23,026
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's
gone through Mazril and Deraa.

1657
03:14:23,277 --> 03:14:26,946
Very good, by the way. Very
good indeed. Now your turn.

1658
03:14:27,114 --> 03:14:30,491
If the enemy's retreating in any kind
of order, which we'd better assume...

1659
03:14:30,659 --> 03:14:31,993
Certainly.

1660
03:14:32,161 --> 03:14:33,911
He can't be far from
this Mallud place...

1661
03:14:34,580 --> 03:14:38,875
in which case I can have him within
range by 0900 hours tomorrow.

1662
03:14:39,126 --> 03:14:41,127
Splendid. Philip.

1663
03:14:41,545 --> 03:14:44,213
Well, these are the last infantry
supports going up now, sir.

1664
03:14:44,465 --> 03:14:48,009
But Mallud, we could have
the fusiliers there by Wednesday.

1665
03:14:48,719 --> 03:14:52,096
That'll do for now.
The guns are what matter.

1666
03:14:52,264 --> 03:14:53,598
Any questions?

1667
03:14:54,058 --> 03:14:58,144
This Arab army on the
right, sir, what's it consist of?

1668
03:14:58,645 --> 03:15:00,897
Irregular cavalry,
sir. About 2000.

1669
03:15:01,065 --> 03:15:02,940
Where are they now?

1670
03:15:03,650 --> 03:15:05,485
Can only know that by
being with them, sir.

1671
03:15:05,652 --> 03:15:08,571
Then get with them,
Harry. I want to know.

1672
03:15:08,864 --> 03:15:11,157
Pound them, Charley.

1673
03:15:11,784 --> 03:15:13,159
Pound them.

1674
03:15:23,754 --> 03:15:26,547
God help the men
who lie under that.

1675
03:15:26,799 --> 03:15:28,466
They're Turks.

1676
03:15:28,634 --> 03:15:30,301
God help them.

1677
03:16:13,011 --> 03:16:16,764
Well, he's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1678
03:16:17,015 --> 03:16:18,349
Cocky?

1679
03:16:18,517 --> 03:16:20,309
More than cocky, sir.

1680
03:16:20,561 --> 03:16:23,896
He's got the bit
between his teeth all right.

1681
03:16:24,148 --> 03:16:27,608
I tell you, sir, I think he'll
get to Damascus before we do.

1682
03:16:28,277 --> 03:16:30,153
- Unless...
- Unless?

1683
03:16:30,320 --> 03:16:34,198
Well, there's a Turkish column
in front of him, out of Mazril.

1684
03:16:34,450 --> 03:16:37,410
- What do the Turks have in Mazril?
- A brigade, sir.

1685
03:16:40,414 --> 03:16:42,623
I wonder where they are now.

1686
03:18:03,330 --> 03:18:05,289
Hut.

1687
03:18:24,518 --> 03:18:25,851
No prisoners.

1688
03:18:29,356 --> 03:18:31,482
Damascus, Aurens.

1689
03:18:41,368 --> 03:18:44,203
Aurens, not this.

1690
03:18:44,913 --> 03:18:48,958
Go round. Damascus,
Aurens, Damascus.

1691
03:18:49,668 --> 03:18:51,294
No prisoners.

1692
03:18:59,177 --> 03:19:01,053
Aurens.

1693
03:19:01,388 --> 03:19:03,014
This was Talaal's village.

1694
03:19:07,227 --> 03:19:09,228
Talaal!

1695
03:19:19,156 --> 03:19:20,489
Talaal!

1696
03:19:29,541 --> 03:19:31,542
No prisoners!

1697
03:19:31,752 --> 03:19:33,085
No prisoners!

1698
03:19:44,931 --> 03:19:46,265
God.

1699
03:19:50,062 --> 03:19:51,395
God.

1700
03:19:53,273 --> 03:19:54,690
God!

1701
03:21:44,384 --> 03:21:46,510
Aurens!

1702
03:21:55,353 --> 03:21:57,021
Aurens!

1703
03:22:03,612 --> 03:22:05,404
Aurens!

1704
03:22:09,868 --> 03:22:11,410
Aurens.

1705
03:22:11,953 --> 03:22:15,122
Enough. Enough!
Make them stop!

1706
03:22:35,644 --> 03:22:37,561
Aurens.

1707
03:22:40,982 --> 03:22:42,316
Aurens.

1708
03:22:48,031 --> 03:22:49,365
Aurens.

1709
03:23:52,429 --> 03:23:53,762
Major!

1710
03:23:54,389 --> 03:23:56,056
Major Lawrence!

1711
03:24:01,730 --> 03:24:03,355
Jesus wept.

1712
03:24:18,872 --> 03:24:20,205
Jesus wept.

1713
03:24:22,125 --> 03:24:24,168
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?

1714
03:24:24,794 --> 03:24:27,546
Surely you know the Arabs
are a barbarous people.

1715
03:24:27,797 --> 03:24:29,632
Barbarous and cruel.

1716
03:24:30,425 --> 03:24:32,343
Who but they?

1717
03:24:32,719 --> 03:24:34,053
Who but they?

1718
03:24:36,389 --> 03:24:38,807
Oh, you rotten man.

1719
03:24:39,851 --> 03:24:44,229
Here, let me take
your rotten bloody picture.

1720
03:24:46,358 --> 03:24:48,442
For the rotten bloody newspapers.

1721
03:25:14,928 --> 03:25:18,430
These were cut last night,
Aurens, in Damascus.

1722
03:25:18,890 --> 03:25:20,599
Damascus!

1723
03:25:20,767 --> 03:25:22,643
Take them to Sherif Ali.

1724
03:25:22,894 --> 03:25:24,269
Tell him.

1725
03:25:25,271 --> 03:25:26,981
Remind him.

1726
03:25:27,857 --> 03:25:30,943
- Is Allenby in Damascus?
- Near.

1727
03:25:31,778 --> 03:25:34,071
Tell Sherif Ali that.

1728
03:25:35,365 --> 03:25:37,199
They are not ripe.

1729
03:25:43,123 --> 03:25:45,207
General salute!

1730
03:25:45,375 --> 03:25:48,002
Present...

1731
03:25:48,586 --> 03:25:50,004
arms!

1732
03:26:01,975 --> 03:26:03,851
Port arms!

1733
03:26:06,646 --> 03:26:08,522
Lawrence is
behind it, sir.

1734
03:26:08,773 --> 03:26:11,608
The whole town is plastered
with the Arab flag.

1735
03:26:17,949 --> 03:26:19,783
- When?
- A day and a night, sir.

1736
03:26:19,951 --> 03:26:21,827
They've been here
a day and a night.

1737
03:26:22,078 --> 03:26:24,580
They've occupied the
town, sir. They've done it.

1738
03:26:24,831 --> 03:26:28,709
He's set up his own
headquarters in the town hall.

1739
03:26:29,627 --> 03:26:31,462
What else beside
the town hall?

1740
03:26:31,713 --> 03:26:34,590
Telephone exchange,
post office, powerhouse,

1741
03:26:34,841 --> 03:26:37,301
hospitals, fire station.
Everything, sir.

1742
03:26:37,469 --> 03:26:40,429
They call themselves
the Arab National Council,

1743
03:26:40,597 --> 03:26:42,264
and they're in
the town hall.

1744
03:26:42,515 --> 03:26:45,392
Well, they're your
pigeon, Harry.

1745
03:26:46,895 --> 03:26:48,729
What do you think we
should we do about it?

1746
03:26:48,897 --> 03:26:51,190
Well, get them out
of it, sir, quick time.

1747
03:26:52,067 --> 03:26:53,942
How about that, Dryden?

1748
03:26:55,695 --> 03:26:58,447
Not unless you want a full-scale
rising on your hands.

1749
03:26:59,199 --> 03:27:02,284
- Well, what, then?
- When will Feisal be in Damascus?

1750
03:27:02,452 --> 03:27:04,536
By special train in
two days' time.

1751
03:27:04,704 --> 03:27:06,038
Two days.

1752
03:27:06,206 --> 03:27:09,625
Two days is what you asked me for.
I can't keep him out any longer.

1753
03:27:09,876 --> 03:27:11,960
- Isn't it enough?
- Yes.

1754
03:27:12,128 --> 03:27:15,547
- Ample, I should think.
- Look, sir, we can't just do nothing.

1755
03:27:15,799 --> 03:27:18,634
Why not? It's usually best.
Get us something to drink, Tracey.

1756
03:27:18,802 --> 03:27:20,135
Yes, sir.

1757
03:27:20,303 --> 03:27:22,805
And, Tracey, all troops to remain
quartered until further orders.

1758
03:27:22,972 --> 03:27:25,974
Yes, sir. Does that apply
to technical units, sir?

1759
03:27:26,226 --> 03:27:28,352
Technical units particularly.

1760
03:27:28,603 --> 03:27:29,937
Yes, sir.

1761
03:27:30,522 --> 03:27:31,939
Medicals too, sir?

1762
03:27:32,190 --> 03:27:34,399
I'm afraid so, Harry.

1763
03:27:34,734 --> 03:27:36,485
Medicals too.

1764
03:28:16,818 --> 03:28:18,443
We here

1765
03:28:18,611 --> 03:28:21,530
are neither Harith nor Howeitat,

1766
03:28:21,698 --> 03:28:24,867
nor any other tribe, but Arabs

1767
03:28:25,160 --> 03:28:28,620
of the Arab Council,
acting for Prince Feisal.

1768
03:28:28,872 --> 03:28:30,914
He insulted me.

1769
03:28:32,041 --> 03:28:36,128
Sherif Ali said that the telephones
are in the care of the Howeitat

1770
03:28:36,379 --> 03:28:39,214
and that the telephones have ceased
to work. And this is true, Auda.

1771
03:28:39,674 --> 03:28:43,468
They will not work because
they are given no electricity.

1772
03:28:43,636 --> 03:28:47,181
The electricity is
in the care of the Harith.

1773
03:28:49,642 --> 03:28:51,977
If you answer,
there will be bloodshed.

1774
03:28:52,896 --> 03:28:56,356
You speak to me
of bloodshed?

1775
03:28:59,110 --> 03:29:03,030
I ask pardon
of Auda Abu Tayi.

1776
03:29:03,281 --> 03:29:04,823
Humbly?

1777
03:29:04,991 --> 03:29:06,408
Humbly, Harith?

1778
03:29:06,659 --> 03:29:08,660
Yes, humbly.

1779
03:29:09,037 --> 03:29:11,163
This is a new trick.

1780
03:29:12,165 --> 03:29:13,832
Why is there no electricity?

1781
03:29:14,792 --> 03:29:17,544
I have been to that
electrical house, Aurens.

1782
03:29:17,795 --> 03:29:20,672
There are three large machines.

1783
03:29:20,924 --> 03:29:23,258
He means generators!

1784
03:29:23,593 --> 03:29:24,927
So.

1785
03:29:25,345 --> 03:29:27,054
One of them is burning.

1786
03:29:27,305 --> 03:29:30,432
They are of an incredible
size, but helpless.

1787
03:29:30,725 --> 03:29:33,518
It is so of all machines.

1788
03:29:33,686 --> 03:29:37,689
Let them burn.
What need of telephones?

1789
03:29:40,360 --> 03:29:43,528
- The need is absolute.
- Then we need the English engineers.

1790
03:29:43,780 --> 03:29:47,407
No. Take English engineers
and you take English government.

1791
03:29:47,575 --> 03:29:48,909
Take...

1792
03:29:52,914 --> 03:29:54,248
Fire has broken out.

1793
03:29:54,415 --> 03:29:56,041
- Where?
- The Jinsibi district.

1794
03:29:56,292 --> 03:29:59,169
- It is not a district that matters.
- It will spread!

1795
03:29:59,420 --> 03:30:01,129
Then in God's name,
use the fire brigade!

1796
03:30:01,381 --> 03:30:04,258
We have tried, but there
is no force in the water.

1797
03:30:04,509 --> 03:30:06,009
Then you must carry it.

1798
03:30:06,261 --> 03:30:10,597
- The Ruala do not carry water.
- What else are they good for?

1799
03:30:22,902 --> 03:30:26,446
We will hear petitions this afternoon.

1800
03:30:29,325 --> 03:30:31,034
This afternoon!

1801
03:30:54,767 --> 03:30:58,812
- I'm gonna take this up after the war.
- Surely we should do something, sir.

1802
03:30:58,980 --> 03:31:02,983
- It's an old man's sport.
- Are you an old man, sir?

1803
03:31:03,151 --> 03:31:06,069
Well, all I can say is, sir,
it's a heavy responsibility.

1804
03:31:07,488 --> 03:31:08,822
Sorry, sir.

1805
03:31:11,075 --> 03:31:12,743
Maybe it's the bulb.

1806
03:31:17,248 --> 03:31:18,582
No, sir.

1807
03:31:19,000 --> 03:31:20,667
It's the power.

1808
03:31:35,850 --> 03:31:37,267
They're leaving, sir.

1809
03:31:37,935 --> 03:31:39,644
That's it, then.

1810
03:31:40,146 --> 03:31:42,272
Marvellous-looking
beggars, aren't they?

1811
03:32:03,461 --> 03:32:06,338
Leave it, Aurens.
Come with me.

1812
03:32:06,631 --> 03:32:08,632
- Come where?
- Back.

1813
03:32:13,054 --> 03:32:15,305
I know your heart.

1814
03:32:23,731 --> 03:32:25,357
What is it?

1815
03:32:26,359 --> 03:32:28,026
Is it this?

1816
03:32:30,780 --> 03:32:33,865
I tell you, this is nothing.

1817
03:32:47,046 --> 03:32:48,713
Is it the blood?

1818
03:32:49,507 --> 03:32:52,634
The desert has dried up more
blood than you could think of.

1819
03:32:54,178 --> 03:32:58,515
I pray that I may never
see the desert again.

1820
03:32:59,559 --> 03:33:00,892
Hear me, God.

1821
03:33:02,603 --> 03:33:06,440
You will come. There is
only the desert for you.

1822
03:33:23,249 --> 03:33:24,583
What about you, Ali?

1823
03:33:25,585 --> 03:33:29,212
No, I shall stay here
and learn politics.

1824
03:33:31,716 --> 03:33:33,091
That's a very low occupation.

1825
03:33:33,593 --> 03:33:36,636
I had not thought of it
when I met you.

1826
03:33:45,605 --> 03:33:48,565
You have tried very hard
to give us Damascus.

1827
03:33:48,733 --> 03:33:50,609
It's what I came for.

1828
03:33:54,071 --> 03:33:55,405
And then...

1829
03:33:57,783 --> 03:33:59,117
it would be something.

1830
03:33:59,285 --> 03:34:00,619
Yes.

1831
03:34:01,162 --> 03:34:02,496
Much.

1832
03:34:21,557 --> 03:34:23,975
- He is your friend?
- Take your hand away.

1833
03:34:24,143 --> 03:34:25,477
- You love him.
- No, I fear him.

1834
03:34:25,728 --> 03:34:27,521
Then why do you weep?

1835
03:34:27,897 --> 03:34:30,065
If I fear him,
who love him,

1836
03:34:30,233 --> 03:34:33,151
how must he fear himself,
who hates himself?

1837
03:34:33,528 --> 03:34:36,154
Take your hand
away, Howeitat!

1838
03:34:36,322 --> 03:34:38,281
Oh...

1839
03:34:39,075 --> 03:34:42,118
So you are not yet
entirely politician.

1840
03:34:42,286 --> 03:34:43,620
Not yet.

1841
03:34:43,871 --> 03:34:48,208
Well, these are new tricks,
and I am an old dog.

1842
03:34:48,793 --> 03:34:50,669
And Allah be thanked.

1843
03:34:51,170 --> 03:34:52,587
I'll tell thee what, though,

1844
03:34:52,838 --> 03:34:56,174
being an Arab will be thornier
than you suppose, Harith.

1845
03:35:17,655 --> 03:35:20,991
In all my years as a medical officer,
I've never seen anything like it.

1846
03:35:21,284 --> 03:35:24,077
It comes within the jurisdiction
of the Arab Council.

1847
03:35:24,328 --> 03:35:28,665
I'm sorry, sir. Under the circumstances,
I think I must take over. Immediately.

1848
03:35:28,916 --> 03:35:31,960
Under any circumstances at all,
you must obey your orders.

1849
03:35:32,211 --> 03:35:33,795
No, sir, I will not.

1850
03:35:34,714 --> 03:35:36,339
Control yourself.

1851
03:35:36,841 --> 03:35:39,926
Now, go over to the town hall
and see what they say.

1852
03:35:40,886 --> 03:35:43,221
We did what we could
in the civic hospitals.

1853
03:35:43,389 --> 03:35:44,723
But you forgot the Turkish
Military Hospital.

1854
03:35:44,890 --> 03:35:46,224
Yes.

1855
03:35:46,601 --> 03:35:51,062
It has 600 beds. There are
about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.

1856
03:35:51,731 --> 03:35:56,359
All of whom are the responsibility
of your precious Arab Council.

1857
03:36:03,075 --> 03:36:04,534
What's it like?

1858
03:37:21,362 --> 03:37:23,446
This is outrageous!

1859
03:37:24,532 --> 03:37:26,449
Outrageous!

1860
03:37:29,495 --> 03:37:30,829
Outrageous!

1861
03:37:32,498 --> 03:37:34,708
You filthy little wog!

1862
03:37:45,219 --> 03:37:49,305
My friend Aurens,
if I may call him that.

1863
03:37:49,557 --> 03:37:52,016
"My friend Aurens."

1864
03:37:52,268 --> 03:37:56,896
How many men will claim the right
to use that phrase? How proudly.

1865
03:37:57,064 --> 03:37:59,733
He longs for the greenness
of his native land.

1866
03:37:59,984 --> 03:38:05,071
He pines for the Gothic
cottages of Surrey, is it not?

1867
03:38:05,322 --> 03:38:08,950
Already in imagination,
he catches trout

1868
03:38:09,201 --> 03:38:12,704
and all the activities
of the English gentleman.

1869
03:38:12,955 --> 03:38:16,416
That's me you're describing,
sir, not Colonel Lawrence.

1870
03:38:17,334 --> 03:38:19,586
You're promoted colonel.

1871
03:38:19,754 --> 03:38:22,255
Yes. What for?

1872
03:38:22,423 --> 03:38:25,675
Take the honour,
colonel. Be a little kind.

1873
03:38:25,843 --> 03:38:29,971
As a colonel, you'll have
a cabin to yourself on the boat home.

1874
03:38:30,556 --> 03:38:32,849
Then, thank you.

1875
03:38:36,979 --> 03:38:38,313
Well, then...

1876
03:38:38,606 --> 03:38:39,939
Godspeed.

1877
03:38:40,441 --> 03:38:44,360
There's nothing further
here for a warrior.

1878
03:38:44,653 --> 03:38:48,740
We drive bargains.
Old men's work.

1879
03:38:48,991 --> 03:38:53,369
Young men make wars, and the virtues
of war are the virtues of young men.

1880
03:38:53,621 --> 03:38:57,123
Courage and hope for the future.

1881
03:38:57,291 --> 03:39:00,001
Then old men make the peace.

1882
03:39:01,086 --> 03:39:04,047
And the vices of peace
are the vices of old men.

1883
03:39:04,215 --> 03:39:06,674
Mistrust and caution.

1884
03:39:07,593 --> 03:39:09,427
It must be so.

1885
03:39:25,861 --> 03:39:30,448
What I owe you is beyond evaluation.

1886
03:39:40,209 --> 03:39:43,878
The powerhouse, the telephone
exchange, these I concede.

1887
03:39:44,129 --> 03:39:45,922
The pumping plant
I must retain.

1888
03:39:46,090 --> 03:39:48,633
If you retain the pumping plant,
there will be no water, sir.

1889
03:39:48,884 --> 03:39:50,718
I shall be glad of
any technical assistance.

1890
03:39:50,886 --> 03:39:52,595
In fairness, then, you
must bring down your flag.

1891
03:39:52,847 --> 03:39:56,724
I shall not bring down my flag, and if your
men attempt it, my men will resist it.

1892
03:39:56,976 --> 03:39:58,685
- Have you any men, sir?
- Enough of that.

1893
03:39:58,853 --> 03:40:01,271
It's the kind of thing that
makes a very ugly incident.

1894
03:40:01,605 --> 03:40:03,439
I'm sure your government

1895
03:40:03,691 --> 03:40:07,569
does not wish to appear at the peace
conference in the light of an aggressor.

1896
03:40:09,822 --> 03:40:11,322
I say!

1897
03:40:12,741 --> 03:40:14,659
It's Lawrence, isn't it?

1898
03:40:15,452 --> 03:40:16,828
Well...

1899
03:40:16,996 --> 03:40:19,247
May I shake your hand, sir?

1900
03:40:20,374 --> 03:40:23,001
Just want to be able
to say I'd done it, sir.

1901
03:40:26,630 --> 03:40:28,840
Haven't we met before?

1902
03:40:29,091 --> 03:40:30,717
Don't think so, sir.

1903
03:40:30,885 --> 03:40:33,636
No, no, sir, I should
remember that.

1904
03:40:38,851 --> 03:40:43,062
It is widely known the Arab
Council took power in my name.

1905
03:40:43,230 --> 03:40:45,231
They have no
power, sir. It's illusory.

1906
03:40:45,482 --> 03:40:47,942
Illusions can be
very powerful.

1907
03:40:48,319 --> 03:40:49,903
Particularly...

1908
03:40:50,821 --> 03:40:53,448
when they take this form.

1909
03:40:55,576 --> 03:40:58,578
The world is delighted
at the picture of Damascus

1910
03:40:58,829 --> 03:41:00,788
liberated by the Arab army.

1911
03:41:01,332 --> 03:41:04,375
Led, may I remind you, sir,
by a British-serving officer.

1912
03:41:04,919 --> 03:41:09,964
Ah, yes. But then Aurens
is a sword with two edges.

1913
03:41:10,215 --> 03:41:13,259
We are equally glad
to be rid of him, are we not?

1914
03:41:16,889 --> 03:41:19,098
I thought I was a hard man, sir.

1915
03:41:19,934 --> 03:41:22,226
You are merely a general.

1916
03:41:22,478 --> 03:41:24,103
I...

1917
03:41:24,813 --> 03:41:26,314
must be a king.

1918
03:41:29,318 --> 03:41:31,194
Excuse me, sir.

1919
03:41:45,751 --> 03:41:47,085
Well?

1920
03:41:47,962 --> 03:41:49,379
Well...

1921
03:41:49,797 --> 03:41:52,757
it seems we're to have
a British waterworks

1922
03:41:52,925 --> 03:41:55,218
with an Arab flag on it.

1923
03:41:55,386 --> 03:41:57,345
Do you think it was worth it?

1924
03:41:57,513 --> 03:42:00,306
Not my business.
Thank God I'm a soldier.

1925
03:42:00,474 --> 03:42:01,849
Yes, sir.

1926
03:42:02,017 --> 03:42:03,601
So you keep saying.

1927
03:42:03,769 --> 03:42:05,395
You, I suspect,

1928
03:42:05,896 --> 03:42:09,774
are chief architect
of this compromise.

1929
03:42:10,234 --> 03:42:13,319
- What do you think?
- Me, Your Highness?

1930
03:42:14,029 --> 03:42:18,282
On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.

1931
03:42:56,321 --> 03:42:59,407
Well, sir. Going home.

1932
03:43:00,117 --> 03:43:03,369
- Hm?
- Home, sir.

1933
03:43:10,419 --> 03:43:14,005
♪ Goodbye, Dolly, I must leave you ♪

1934
03:43:14,256 --> 03:43:17,425
♪ Though it breaks my heart to go ♪
