1
00:02:32,472 --> 00:02:35,373
All right. All right, everybody!

2
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:38,308
- My daughter needs a pink spot.
- Never mind now.

3
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:40,639
You'll all get a chance.

4
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:43,174
Herbie. Come here, Herbie.

5
00:02:43,383 --> 00:02:45,943
- We were here first.
- The mothers again.

6
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,782
- Forget the mothers.
- Get 'em out.

7
00:02:47,854 --> 00:02:51,346
I don't want the mothers in the wings.
I don't want 'em in the house!

8
00:02:51,424 --> 00:02:53,119
They're only tryin' to help the kids.

9
00:02:53,192 --> 00:02:55,023
Don't argue with me, Herbie.

10
00:02:55,094 --> 00:02:57,892
Mothers, please, will you get out?
Get off stage!

11
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:06,962
I want you to come forward one at a time.

12
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:11,041
And now let's have the first wee lad
on Uncle Jocko's Kiddie Kapers.

13
00:03:12,078 --> 00:03:14,911
Take 'em each from the top,
then cut to the last eight.

14
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:16,039
All right!

15
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:21,318
Uncle Jocko presents
Clarence and his clarinet.

16
00:03:21,654 --> 00:03:22,916
Go ahead, kid.

17
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:27,652
Cut to the end! To the end, kiddo!

18
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:34,558
And who does Uncle Jocko have here?

19
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:36,491
Baby June and Company.

20
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:39,094
I'm "and Company." I mean, I assist.

21
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,234
That is until Mama finds out
what I do best. She's workin' on it.

22
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:48,345
You seem like nice kids,
but I've only got time for half your routine.

23
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:50,541
Let's have it fast, forte and off. Okay?

24
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:53,149
Herbie, come here.

25
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:56,622
That one's gotta get the contract.

26
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:58,088
The one with the balloons.

27
00:03:58,157 --> 00:04:00,455
The one that gets it is the one with talent.

28
00:04:00,893 --> 00:04:04,761
- I'm the boss and I pick the cast.
- And I'm getting sick of it, George.

29
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:11,263
Gus, hit this doll with a surprise pink
when she does her turn, huh?

30
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:16,999
And now Uncle Jocko presents
Baby June and Company.

31
00:04:21,547 --> 00:04:25,108
"Let me entertain you

32
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:28,954
"Let me see you smile

33
00:04:29,622 --> 00:04:32,113
"I will do some kicks

34
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:36,459
"I will do some tricks

35
00:04:36,863 --> 00:04:39,991
"I'll tell you a story

36
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,790
"I'll dance when she's done"

37
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:44,666
Sing out, Louise! Sing out!

38
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:46,598
Now quiet. Who said that?

39
00:04:46,773 --> 00:04:49,503
You're behind, Louise.
Catch up, dear, catch up.

40
00:04:49,742 --> 00:04:51,232
Hold it! Hold it!

41
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,335
Get off the stage, please!

42
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:56,377
Didn't I see your sensitive face
at the Odd Fellows Hall?

43
00:04:56,616 --> 00:04:57,412
I'm not an Odd Fellow.

44
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,951
- Knight of Pythias.
- I'm not a Knight of Pythias.

45
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:01,953
- Aren't you anything?
- I'm an Elk.

46
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:04,182
I should have known it
by your good manners.

47
00:05:04,257 --> 00:05:06,782
My father's an Elk, too.
1853 Seattle, Washington.

48
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:09,760
I got his tooth here someplace.
I'm an Honorable Elk.

49
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:10,818
Hi, Bill.

50
00:05:10,897 --> 00:05:13,127
Mind holding Chowsie?
That's short for Chow Mein.

51
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,635
Mama just loves chow mein.
Stop sucking your thumb, Louise.

52
00:05:16,702 --> 00:05:19,762
I just marvel how you can make
a performer into an artist.

53
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,639
So you can help my little girls by giving
them a nice loud "da-de-da de-da-da."

54
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:27,008
Mr. Zipser, when my girls do
their specialty would you ad-lib it?

55
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,171
- Sure.
- Show 'em, girls.

56
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:30,715
- You're the boss. What do I do?
- Get her out!

57
00:05:30,783 --> 00:05:33,513
Mr. Electrical!
Would you please spot Baby June?

58
00:05:33,853 --> 00:05:37,289
The one with all the movement.
Each movement has a meaning of it's own.

59
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:40,052
Hit her with something pink.
Or would you prefer amber?

60
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:42,560
I never can make up my mind
what color to use.

61
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:44,619
Decisions, decisions, decisions!

62
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,264
She's ready for the big time.

63
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:48,766
We'd be there too
if we had first-class management.

64
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:49,927
Big time?

65
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,698
Open time, layoff time, big time.
Boy, is she...

66
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:56,401
Is that so? Don't you laugh.
Don't you dare laugh!

67
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:58,500
Please, let us get on.

68
00:05:58,578 --> 00:06:01,046
- We're not finished.
- You are according to me.

69
00:06:01,113 --> 00:06:04,981
'Cause you're playing favorites with
Miss Balloon? Louise heard every word.

70
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:08,316
How dare you let that untalented balloon
block up my babies!

71
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:12,179
I won't leave this stage till she does.
Have you no loyalty to the Elks?

72
00:06:12,258 --> 00:06:17,025
- It's not a question of Elks, but of talent.
- My girls have the only talent on the stage.

73
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:21,395
I'll tell that to the editor of the Gazette.
Which it so happens, he's an Elk.

74
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:25,028
I'll also shout out loud the whole audition
is bein' fixed because of her.

75
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:27,038
You get in the wings and wait.

76
00:06:31,277 --> 00:06:32,801
Thank you, Professor.

77
00:06:34,046 --> 00:06:35,445
Thank you, Jocko.

78
00:06:35,514 --> 00:06:36,913
Herbie, come here.

79
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,042
Thank you, Mr. Zipser.

80
00:06:40,052 --> 00:06:43,044
I don't care who she shouts on,
we sign the balloon.

81
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,593
You sign, I resign!

82
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:55,028
Hit it, girls!

83
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:07,702
Uncle Jocko was a gent. He quit.

84
00:07:08,247 --> 00:07:11,375
And I made the usual arrangements
with my wedding rings.

85
00:07:11,651 --> 00:07:12,675
Pawned them.

86
00:07:12,852 --> 00:07:17,846
All three of them. And we all started back
to Pa's house in Seattle to refinance.

87
00:07:18,324 --> 00:07:22,624
We were like an advancing army
on the big time, backfirin' all the way.

88
00:07:23,796 --> 00:07:27,789
Mama, I've been thinking.
How come I have three fathers?

89
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:29,791
Because you're lucky.

90
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:32,763
Does it have to be this cold, Mama?

91
00:07:32,905 --> 00:07:36,932
Breathe hard on each other, kids,
and hold that Thermos up against you.

92
00:07:38,577 --> 00:07:42,809
Why does this pile of junk
have to be stopping all the time?

93
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:44,950
Because it isn't going, Mama.

94
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,985
The trouble's got to be in either
the universal joint or the rear end.

95
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:51,279
Now, now. No dirty talk.

96
00:07:51,857 --> 00:07:54,621
Don't worry. Whatever it is, I'll fix it.

97
00:08:00,566 --> 00:08:02,295
I think something melted.

98
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:03,794
Look, Mama.

99
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:07,271
What are we gonna do?

100
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:09,965
We'll break our jump.

101
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:12,739
There must be a theater in this hamlet.

102
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:16,642
We'll get a hitch into town, which means
we'll go see one of Mama's brothers.

103
00:08:16,716 --> 00:08:19,310
Have you got brothers
in this town, too, Mama?

104
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:22,452
Practically all men in America
are Mama's brothers.

105
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:25,120
Like your grandpa says:

106
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:29,093
"You can always tell the size
of a man's heart by the button in his lapel."

107
00:08:29,362 --> 00:08:32,229
What would Grandpa say
about this automobile, Mama?

108
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:34,293
He'd ask if it was insured.

109
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,594
It is, isn't it?

110
00:08:36,068 --> 00:08:37,296
Only for fire.

111
00:08:39,772 --> 00:08:41,069
Get everything out.

112
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,402
I smell smoke!

113
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,910
Mr. Willis, don't give me that stuff about
what the other salesman used to sell you.

114
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:52,781
How much of his candy did you sell?
Practically zero. He steered you wrong.

115
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:56,219
You're not on the ball with your patrons
selling plain chocolate bars.

116
00:08:56,288 --> 00:08:59,815
It's like women wearing bustles.
Now this is an era of flaming youth.

117
00:08:59,892 --> 00:09:03,089
Of flappers, of shifters.
It's a world that crunches.

118
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:06,521
What should you sell?
Crunchy Butterfingers.

119
00:09:06,665 --> 00:09:10,795
Crispy Baby Ruths covered with our
nourishing milk chocolate, safe for a baby.

120
00:09:11,137 --> 00:09:13,628
I'm gonna put you down
for 100 gross, Mr. Willis.

121
00:09:13,773 --> 00:09:16,469
I personally guarantee
you'll reorder within a month.

122
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:19,602
- Ten dozen chocolate bars.
- You're cheating yourself. Here.

123
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:21,077
Ask her what her kids eat.

124
00:09:21,714 --> 00:09:23,113
Butterfingers, so help me.

125
00:09:23,182 --> 00:09:25,480
I speak as a mother.
Who'd argue with a mother?

126
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:27,916
Not me. Twenty dozen assorted.

127
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:31,748
Are you the woman Buffalo
Mr. Beckman called me about?

128
00:09:31,857 --> 00:09:34,087
I certainly am. I came to discuss the act.

129
00:09:34,193 --> 00:09:38,095
- Now, how big is your orchestra?
- Three pieces. Piano, cover and stool.

130
00:09:38,898 --> 00:09:41,799
- What kind of act do you do?
- It's great. I caught it in LA.

131
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:44,233
- You two a team?
- I've never seen him before.

132
00:09:44,303 --> 00:09:45,600
I speak only as a pro.

133
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:49,163
Well, sometimes I play an act
when I got a weak movie.

134
00:09:50,543 --> 00:09:53,103
Tell you the truth, lady,
I got a weak movie.

135
00:09:53,546 --> 00:09:56,640
But this town's very brotherhood-minded
Buffalo-wise.

136
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,577
Are you sure you're a lady Buffalo?

137
00:10:01,387 --> 00:10:02,479
Honorary.

138
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:07,855
- Now we can talk turkey.
- Turkey's 60-40.

139
00:10:07,927 --> 00:10:08,916
That's a deal.

140
00:10:08,994 --> 00:10:11,292
She gets the 60, you get the 40.

141
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,588
But no guarantee.

142
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:15,759
With a town full of Buffaloes,
she doesn't need a guarantee.

143
00:10:15,835 --> 00:10:19,271
I don't like it, but I'm stuck
with my Buffalo oath.

144
00:10:20,406 --> 00:10:24,274
Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go
to the ladies room and fix the sink.

145
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:30,476
- Thanks for getting me that 60.
- Thanks for getting me this order.

146
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,778
Thanks for saying
you caught the act in LA.

147
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:34,679
I did. Hello, Chowsie.

148
00:10:35,488 --> 00:10:36,853
I was Uncle Jocko.

149
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,053
Uncle Jocko! Well, where's your goggles
and tam-o'-shanter?

150
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:42,719
How come you're sellin' candy?

151
00:10:42,795 --> 00:10:44,729
I quit the profession, thanks to you.

152
00:10:45,097 --> 00:10:45,722
Me?

153
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:47,493
You triggered it down in LA.

154
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:51,366
I had this candy bar proposition
for a long time and I'm singing like a bird.

155
00:10:51,437 --> 00:10:53,803
I tip the Fedora to you.
Name is Herbie Sommers.

156
00:10:53,873 --> 00:10:55,602
Hovick. Rose Hovick.

157
00:10:55,774 --> 00:10:58,641
How come you quit the profession
to become a candy butcher?

158
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:00,611
Because, lady, Rose...

159
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,772
The profession is makin' a buck
the hard way.

160
00:11:02,848 --> 00:11:04,543
Not if it's in your blood.

161
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:10,948
When you say that, you look like
a pioneer woman without a frontier.

162
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:14,154
Is that good or bad?

163
00:11:14,226 --> 00:11:18,322
It's good. You've got what it takes.
You won't let the world push you around.

164
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:21,226
Say, it's that fashionable
cocktail hour again, Rose.

165
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,894
I'd like to buy you a small booze
and a bite to eat.

166
00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:27,700
Now, there's a local speak which has
fair gin but dandy chow mein...

167
00:11:27,773 --> 00:11:29,934
...if you happen to go in for Chinese food.

168
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:31,670
Is there any other kind?

169
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:40,714
Say, you're a regular Irene Castle, Rose.

170
00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:43,584
Everybody in my family is except Louise.

171
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:46,186
- But you're working on it.
- You bet I am.

172
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:50,294
She must be able to do somethin'.
But June is already the show-biz whiz.

173
00:11:50,362 --> 00:11:51,795
She's a worker all right.

174
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:55,027
I'd like to see her in a big flash act.
A lot of scenery.

175
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,831
Maybe six little girls behind her.
All brunettes to show off her blondness.

176
00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:02,772
To really show her off, you oughta
back her up with boys, like Ziegfeld does.

177
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:06,208
What does he know about vaudeville?
My mind's made up, it'll be girls.

178
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:08,678
No, you're wrong, Rose, it oughta be boys.

179
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:11,278
I don't need any advice
from a candy butcher.

180
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:16,846
Check, please.

181
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:18,817
Herbie, don't get so mad.

182
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:21,291
I know I need advice.
I know I need management.

183
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,726
- I know everybody in the business.
- Who?

184
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:25,764
- Later, boy, later.
- Yes, ma'am.

185
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:28,890
Who don't I know?
That's a better question.

186
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:32,665
In my time, I've met them all: Mr. Albee,
Mr. Loew, even Mr. Goldstone.

187
00:12:32,738 --> 00:12:35,229
You know what Mr. Goldstone says
when he sees me?

188
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,530
What?

189
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:38,304
He says, "Hello, Herbie."

190
00:12:41,413 --> 00:12:42,641
Hello, Herbie.

191
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:45,642
Hello, Rose.

192
00:12:46,852 --> 00:12:47,978
I like you.

193
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:52,481
You certainly didn't show it
when we auditioned for you in LA.

194
00:12:52,558 --> 00:12:55,118
We had so many stage mothers there...

195
00:12:55,194 --> 00:12:58,288
- I hate to see mothers exploiting their kids.
- Not me.

196
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,896
I'm a mother first and don't you forget it.

197
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:04,299
That's why I'm taking the girls
back to Seattle to my father's house.

198
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,965
So that June can go to the dentist
and Louise can get her tonsils out.

199
00:13:08,207 --> 00:13:11,108
I knew you were a good mother.
Wanna know something?

200
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:13,603
I'm crazy for mothers.

201
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,474
Yeah? Anybody who likes mothers
so much should have been a father.

202
00:13:17,616 --> 00:13:21,609
I never married. I had five sisters.
The ugly one didn't marry until a year ago.

203
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,187
She's pregnant now.

204
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,080
I don't like dirty talk.

205
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:33,762
- I apologize.
- No need to. You're a gent and I like gents.

206
00:13:33,832 --> 00:13:36,062
Does that mean you'd consider
marrying again?

207
00:13:36,135 --> 00:13:38,831
Not me. I don't mean for instance,
but anybody?

208
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:44,206
After three husbands it takes a lot o' butter
to get you back in the frying pan.

209
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,668
How much butter, Rose?

210
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:51,273
That all depends on who's dishing it out.
This time he'd have to be in the profession.

211
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,285
Why? After 20 years of show business...

212
00:13:55,754 --> 00:13:58,552
No, you kind of breathe better
in the real world.

213
00:13:59,224 --> 00:14:00,452
- Funny.
- What?

214
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:01,826
Us.

215
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:04,663
I like you, but I don't want marriage.

216
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,857
You like me.
You don't want show business.

217
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:10,960
That seems to leave you there
and me here.

218
00:14:11,637 --> 00:14:13,867
Now that depends on how you look at it.

219
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:17,170
You look at what we don't have.
I look at what we do have.

220
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:19,504
"Funny

221
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:22,945
"You're a stranger who's come here

222
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:26,250
"Come from another town

223
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,980
"Funny

224
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:32,150
"I'm a stranger myself here

225
00:14:33,025 --> 00:14:35,687
"Small world, isn't it?

226
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:38,523
"Funny

227
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:41,632
"You're a man who goes travelling

228
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,097
"Rather than settlin' down

229
00:14:46,505 --> 00:14:47,665
"Funny

230
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:50,840
"'Cause I love to go travellin'

231
00:14:51,543 --> 00:14:54,205
"Small world, isn't it?

232
00:14:55,614 --> 00:14:59,516
"We have so much in common

233
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:02,847
"It's a phenomenon

234
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:08,150
"We could pool our resources

235
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:10,920
"By joining forces

236
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:12,759
"From now on

237
00:15:13,665 --> 00:15:14,825
"Lucky

238
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:18,202
"You're a man who likes children

239
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:22,029
"That's an important sign

240
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:24,569
"Lucky

241
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,679
"I'm a woman with children

242
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,072
"Small world, isn't it?

243
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:36,076
"Funny, isn't it?

244
00:15:37,723 --> 00:15:41,955
"Small and funny

245
00:15:43,128 --> 00:15:46,291
"And fine"

246
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:51,731
Sometimes it's a real fine world, Rose...

247
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:54,436
...like tonight.

248
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,004
Yeah.

249
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:57,439
But there's tomorrow.

250
00:15:57,509 --> 00:16:01,912
Tomorrow I gotta get those kids on a train
and, gee, Herbie, how they hate trains.

251
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,311
Where's your next stop?

252
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:05,714
I'm goin' back east to Chicago
and the home office.

253
00:16:05,784 --> 00:16:06,910
Chicago?

254
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,852
Do you know Mr. Weber
of the Weber Theater in Chicago?

255
00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:12,516
He likes kid acts.
Maybe you could talk to him.

256
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,985
Be a cinch.

257
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,357
Might also be a cinch for me to drive you
and your beautiful family to Seattle.

258
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,422
- I couldn't ask you to go out of your way.
- Why not?

259
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,627
Seattle's just a hop, skip and a jump...

260
00:16:23,702 --> 00:16:27,900
I wouldn't mind a hop, skip and a jump,
if you'd sit in the front seat with me.

261
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:30,567
And I like company, especially children.

262
00:16:30,776 --> 00:16:32,937
You like kumquat? Fortune cookies?

263
00:16:34,847 --> 00:16:37,645
- No, I want the check now, though.
- Yes, sir.

264
00:16:41,153 --> 00:16:42,620
I have a suggestion.

265
00:16:42,721 --> 00:16:46,452
If you'd like to test my driving,
just hop into the old flivver right now.

266
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:49,024
I'll show you the view
from Lookout Mountain.

267
00:16:49,094 --> 00:16:51,528
Sure, Herbie. Just wait'll I get my hat.

268
00:16:52,264 --> 00:16:53,526
And my hatpin.

269
00:16:55,834 --> 00:17:00,203
So everything was comin' up roses.
Herbie drove us all the way to Seattle.

270
00:17:00,372 --> 00:17:03,136
It was a pleasure to have a man
behind the wheel.

271
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:06,706
All right, let's face it,
it was a pleasure to have a man.

272
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:10,740
This is the end of the line, Rose.
I'll sure be missing you all a lot.

273
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:14,149
- I owe you money for lunches and stuff.
- Mark it on ice.

274
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:15,208
Grandpa!

275
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:17,050
- Hello, sweethearts.
- Hi, Grandpa.

276
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:20,319
- I've been worried crazy.
- You worry too much, Pa.

277
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:24,423
I want you to meet Mr. Sommers,
a very big gentleman in the candy game.

278
00:17:24,496 --> 00:17:28,091
- Herbie, this is my father.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance, sir.

279
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,292
Glad to meet you.

280
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:31,393
Did the express company deliver
our valises?

281
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,529
Yeah, to the station, collect.

282
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:37,035
Pa was head of the baggage room
at the Kings St. Station.

283
00:17:37,109 --> 00:17:39,805
Pa also plays the piano good.
Pa could've been a real pro.

284
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:41,846
You just stop with that show talk.

285
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:44,644
Guess I'll be shovin'.
I'll be seeing ya, Rose.

286
00:17:44,716 --> 00:17:45,876
I'll be seeing ya, Herbie.

287
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:47,077
I'll be seeing ya, kids.

288
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:48,642
I'll be seeing ya, Herbie.

289
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:50,313
I'll be seeing ya.

290
00:17:51,723 --> 00:17:54,692
I'll be seeing ya. More show talk.

291
00:17:55,594 --> 00:17:57,687
- Goodbye, Rose.
- So long, Herbie.

292
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:23,614
"Act opens Weber Theater, Chicago.
Split week beginning April 20th.

293
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:26,749
"$300. Agreement calls for
four boys and two girls.

294
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:29,316
"Confirm and rush photos.
Kindest personal regards.

295
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:32,056
"Love, Herbie
P.S. Don't forget, four boys."

296
00:18:32,631 --> 00:18:35,794
Four boys. I gotta teach that Herbie
not to be so pig-headed.

297
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:39,166
I think Herbie's right, Ma.
Boys would be good in the act.

298
00:18:39,304 --> 00:18:41,101
But they better have talent!

299
00:18:41,406 --> 00:18:42,873
Whose act is this?

300
00:18:42,941 --> 00:18:45,307
We've gotta get some dollars
to get to Chicago.

301
00:18:45,377 --> 00:18:47,038
Give me the jewelry, kids.

302
00:18:48,313 --> 00:18:50,440
Mama, do we have to stay
in show business?

303
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:51,607
Hurry up, darling.

304
00:18:51,683 --> 00:18:55,084
Honest, Louise! How are you going
to get the boys, Mama?

305
00:18:55,153 --> 00:18:59,089
We'll get 'em. Louise can be a boy.
We got that jiggin' kid from Klamath Falls.

306
00:18:59,157 --> 00:19:00,852
Herbie and I'll get the others.

307
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,458
- How're we gonna pay them?
- Experience'll be their pay.

308
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:08,124
If I can hock this stuff, I'll get
a down payment for costumes and scenery.

309
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,191
Then we'll squeeze money
out of Grandpa...

310
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:12,759
...and we're on our way to Chicago
and the big time.

311
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:16,001
I gotta get that Reo I saw for sale
for 88 simoleons.

312
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,372
Pa! Oh, Pa!

313
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:20,567
Yeah?

314
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,140
Maybe you think I don't know
you been connivin' behind my back.

315
00:19:25,217 --> 00:19:28,345
I didn't want to tell you till it was sure.
We're booked, Pa.

316
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,583
I got almost enough for incidentals.
I know you'll put up the rest.

317
00:19:31,657 --> 00:19:32,715
Oh, bunk!

318
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,986
Something wonderful will happen
for my girls.

319
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,049
Bunk!

320
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,920
I've had a dream, Pa.

321
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:44,160
Aren't you ashamed of yourself,
fooling our kids with those dreams?

322
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:47,262
They're real dreams and I'll make 'em
come real for my kids.

323
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,136
What are you, a crazy woman?

324
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:52,774
Heaven put you here
because it meant for you to stay right here.

325
00:19:52,844 --> 00:19:56,007
Heaven helps those who help themselves.
And I need your help, Pa!

326
00:19:56,248 --> 00:19:59,012
You squeezed the last penny out of me
you'll ever get!

327
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:01,052
It's too late for me. It's for my kids!

328
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,986
It's not too late for you to get a husband
to support you.

329
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:07,185
After three husbands,
I'm through with marriage.

330
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:10,251
I want to enjoy myself.
I want my girls to enjoy themselves.

331
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:11,795
And travel like Mama does.

332
00:20:11,863 --> 00:20:15,060
Yeah, and you'll leave them
just like your mother left you.

333
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:19,001
Never! I don't want them to sit
their lives away the way I did.

334
00:20:19,204 --> 00:20:22,435
And the way you do,
with nothing but a calendar to tell you...

335
00:20:22,507 --> 00:20:24,498
...one day is different from the next.

336
00:20:24,576 --> 00:20:25,941
And that plaque!

337
00:20:26,545 --> 00:20:30,413
From your grateful railroad company,
to say congratulations.

338
00:20:31,249 --> 00:20:34,980
For 50 years you did the same dull thing
every dull day.

339
00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:38,779
That plaque is a great tribute.
It's solid gold.

340
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:43,416
Yeah?

341
00:20:45,597 --> 00:20:47,189
How much could you get for it?

342
00:20:47,265 --> 00:20:48,493
Rose, if you...

343
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,398
What good's it doing hanging there?

344
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:52,164
That plaque belongs there.

345
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:56,297
Like you belong home instead of
running around the country like a gypsy.

346
00:20:57,476 --> 00:20:59,501
Anybody that stays home is dead.

347
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:04,345
If I die it won't be from sitting,
it'll be from fighting to get up and get out!

348
00:21:05,117 --> 00:21:08,678
"Some people can get a thrill

349
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:12,750
"Knitting sweaters and sittin' still

350
00:21:12,924 --> 00:21:16,325
"That's okay for some people

00:21:16,595 --> 00:21:19,758
"Who don't know they're alive

352
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:24,032
"Some people can thrive and bloom

353
00:21:24,536 --> 00:21:27,801
"Livin' life in a livin' room

354
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,741
"That's perfect for some people

355
00:21:31,943 --> 00:21:34,969
"Of 105

356
00:21:35,614 --> 00:21:40,574
"But I at least gotta try

357
00:21:42,354 --> 00:21:45,653
"When I think of all the sights
That I gotta see yet

358
00:21:45,757 --> 00:21:49,523
"All the places I gotta play

00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:51,685

360
00:21:51,763 --> 00:21:54,789

"For some humdrum people to be

00:22:10,415 --> 00:22:14,078
"But some people ain't me!

00:22:17,055 --> 00:22:20,354
"I had a dream

00:22:21,026 --> 00:22:24,757
"A wonderful dream, Papa

"All about June and the Orpheum Circuit

00:22:29,601 --> 00:22:32,399

00:22:33,638 --> 00:22:36,630
"Just as real as can be, Papa

00:22:58,463 --> 00:23:01,261

376
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,727
"A wonderful dream, Papa

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,673

"That's what he said, Papa

380
00:23:15,981 --> 00:23:17,949
"Only 88 bucks"

381
00:23:21,253 --> 00:23:23,813
You ain't gettin' eight cents from me, Rose.

382
00:23:24,756 --> 00:23:29,090
I'll get it someplace else then.
But I'll get it and I'll get my kids out!

00:23:31,963 --> 00:23:36,957
"Goodbye to blueberry pie

"But not Rose!"

393
00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:27,846
We blew into the Windy City
to break in our new flash act.

394
00:24:28,353 --> 00:24:31,322
Herbie, makin' out like Uncle Jocko,
got us the boys.

395
00:24:31,489 --> 00:24:34,356
The only thing that bugged me
was our spot on the bill...

396
00:24:34,426 --> 00:24:36,894
...following some unknown stand-up comic.

397
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:45,001
My girl is so dumb she was fired
from the five-and-ten cents store...

398
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,795
...because she couldn't remember
the prices.

399
00:24:50,108 --> 00:24:53,805
And her uncle, she's got an uncle,
I won't say that he...

400
00:24:53,979 --> 00:24:58,439
...he drank too much you see,
but two years after he died...

401
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,014
...his liver won a Charleston contest.

402
00:25:06,224 --> 00:25:07,885
How about that one, huh?

403
00:25:08,593 --> 00:25:11,756
Well, listen, I can't go any bigger than that.

404
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:14,759
So good night, folks.
I'll be seeing you soon.

405
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:24,602
Well, let's see your kids follow that.

406
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:27,837
What a ham!

407
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:30,877
Yeah. He'll never get anyplace.

408
00:25:40,492 --> 00:25:41,823
"Extra, extra!

409
00:25:41,893 --> 00:25:45,488
"Hey, look at the headlines
Historical news is being made

410
00:25:46,698 --> 00:25:48,029
"Extra, extra!

411
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:51,728
"They're drawing a red line
Around the biggest scoop of the decade

00:25:53,071 --> 00:25:55,596

413
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:58,874

"Baby June!"

417
00:26:16,594 --> 00:26:19,427
Hello, everybody. My name is June.

418
00:26:19,898 --> 00:26:21,991
What's yours?

419
00:26:27,205 --> 00:26:29,469
"Let me entertain you

420
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,668
"Let me make you smile

421
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:34,336
"Let me do a few tricks
Some old and some new tricks

422
00:26:34,412 --> 00:26:36,903
"I'm very versatile

423
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:39,449
"And if you're real good
I'll make you feel good

424
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:41,516
"I want your spirits to climb

425
00:26:41,619 --> 00:26:43,780
"So let me entertain you

426
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:46,614
"And we'll have a real good time
Yes, sir

427
00:26:46,925 --> 00:26:50,326
"We'll have a real good time"

428
00:28:32,964 --> 00:28:35,660
Mr. Conductor, if you please.

429
00:28:52,617 --> 00:28:55,177
Was I right about June or was I right?

430
00:28:55,353 --> 00:28:58,720
In the next couple of years
she killed the people on the big time.

431
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:02,123
We were Dainty June now
and we headlined the Orpheum Circuit.

432
00:29:27,185 --> 00:29:29,176
Boy, was I ever happy.

433
00:29:29,454 --> 00:29:31,445
My dream was in high gear.

434
00:29:31,923 --> 00:29:34,585
But after a while the booking offices
were in low.

435
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:38,686
Instead of 52 weeks solid,
the next year we signed for only 44.

436
00:29:38,896 --> 00:29:42,559
And the following season,
we laid off as much as we played.

437
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,665
But we worked more than most.

438
00:29:44,736 --> 00:29:47,330
Like this split week
Herbie booked in Newark.

439
00:29:47,572 --> 00:29:52,703
Newark is in New Jersey and New Jersey
is only one big deep breath from New York.

440
00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:56,006
And in New York was Grantziger's Tivoli.

441
00:29:56,414 --> 00:29:59,042
And that was my real big dream.

442
00:30:00,084 --> 00:30:03,383
But did you ever notice
something's always wakin'you up?

443
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:10,386
It ain't even noon yet. Turn it off.

444
00:30:11,996 --> 00:30:12,985
Please!

445
00:30:13,064 --> 00:30:14,463
Turn it off, Plug.

446
00:30:14,832 --> 00:30:16,424
Was that the alarm?

447
00:30:17,001 --> 00:30:19,469
No, it was Major Bowes
and you just got the gong.

448
00:30:37,355 --> 00:30:38,583
Surprise!

449
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,048
Happy birthday, Louise.

450
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,558
Happy birthday, Louise.

451
00:30:42,627 --> 00:30:45,118
Wild Indians. Wild Indians,
that's what you are.

452
00:30:45,196 --> 00:30:46,663
Happy birthday, darling.

453
00:30:46,731 --> 00:30:48,858
- Come on, make a wish.
- Yeah.

454
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:51,160
Oh, I wish...

455
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,035
Oh, Mama, I wish...

456
00:30:54,138 --> 00:30:56,538
That greedy monkey ate a piece
out of the cake.

457
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,632
Bad, Gigolo. Bad, bad, bad.

458
00:30:59,043 --> 00:31:00,908
Blow out the candles, Louise.

459
00:31:02,947 --> 00:31:05,438
Say, that'd make a good coat.

460
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:08,578
There's only ten candles on this cake.

461
00:31:08,653 --> 00:31:11,053
What do you care?
You're not eating candles.

462
00:31:11,122 --> 00:31:14,683
Yeah, but she only had ten candles
last year and the year before that.

463
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:17,489
Come to think of it,
she's had ten candles for the last...

464
00:31:17,562 --> 00:31:18,893
Stop right there.

465
00:31:18,963 --> 00:31:21,625
As long as we have this act,
nobody is over 12.

466
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,398
And you all know it. Except me, of course.

467
00:31:24,469 --> 00:31:28,132
You can give Louise her presents
while I see if the chow mein is warmed up.

468
00:31:28,206 --> 00:31:29,400
Chow mein?

469
00:31:30,575 --> 00:31:31,803
It's my birthday.

470
00:31:32,176 --> 00:31:34,110
But chow mein for breakfast?

471
00:31:35,046 --> 00:31:37,537
Why not? There's an egg roll, isn't there?

472
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:43,680
If your mother paid us a salary,
we could've all bought you presents.

473
00:31:43,788 --> 00:31:46,916
But it's more fun to clip
from the five-and-dime anyway.

474
00:31:48,092 --> 00:31:50,458
It's a catcher's mitt
and a big league baseball.

475
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:53,323
Gee, thanks, Yonkers.

476
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:55,799
I clipped a bowl of goldfish...

477
00:31:55,867 --> 00:31:58,631
...but they caught me,
so I drew a fish instead.

478
00:31:59,971 --> 00:32:01,802
It's beautiful.

479
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,233
Here, Louise.

480
00:32:03,741 --> 00:32:04,799
Oh, June.

481
00:32:06,043 --> 00:32:08,136
You shouldn't have done that.

482
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:10,442
Gee, what a beautiful box.

483
00:32:13,418 --> 00:32:15,215
Oh, it's lined in velvet.

484
00:32:15,787 --> 00:32:18,187
Sure, it's for diamonds and like that...

485
00:32:18,489 --> 00:32:21,356
...because someday, who knows,
you might get some.

486
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,494
It's beautiful. Thank you.

487
00:32:26,297 --> 00:32:29,755
Here, I should've wrapped it.
It's a chicken and it plays music.

488
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,303
You don't have to wrap a music box, Tulsa.

489
00:32:37,675 --> 00:32:39,472
Well, happy birthday, Plug.

490
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,907
Happy birthday, Tulsa.
I mean, you're welcome.

491
00:32:43,948 --> 00:32:48,476
All right, only one egg roll apiece.
I counted them. No more.

492
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:51,313
Take it easy.
Don't claw each other to death.

493
00:32:51,556 --> 00:32:53,786
Now, I wanna tell you about a dream I had.

494
00:32:53,858 --> 00:32:56,383
It's really in your honor,
comin' on your birthday.

495
00:32:56,461 --> 00:32:58,986
Baby, you'll love it. You all will.

496
00:32:59,363 --> 00:33:01,490
Children, it's a new act.

497
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,131
That ain't a dream, it's a miracle.

498
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:08,171
In this act I saw June singing a song
in like a barnyard.

499
00:33:08,706 --> 00:33:09,832
And then...

500
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:12,299
...a cow came onstage.

501
00:33:12,376 --> 00:33:13,274
A cow?

502
00:33:13,344 --> 00:33:14,834
That's pretty sophisticated.

503
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:18,473
Not a real cow. Sort of a dancin' cow,
with a great big smile.

504
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,510
That cow...

505
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:24,479
That cow leaned right over my bed
and spoke to me.

506
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:26,052
What did the cow say?

507
00:33:26,123 --> 00:33:27,283
Mrs. Hovick!

508
00:33:27,358 --> 00:33:31,317
I am not cooking in here, Mr. Kringelein.
That cow, in front of...

509
00:33:31,395 --> 00:33:34,887
- Open up this door!
- I'm dressing. That cow...

510
00:33:35,066 --> 00:33:36,055
Mrs. Hovick!

511
00:33:36,133 --> 00:33:39,500
I'll call you tomorrow when I'm finished.
Now about that cow.

512
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:41,060
Mrs. Hovick!

513
00:33:41,138 --> 00:33:44,471
That dear, talented cow
looked me right in the eye and said:

514
00:33:45,276 --> 00:33:48,939
"Rose, if you want to get back
on the Orpheum Circuit...

515
00:33:49,413 --> 00:33:51,244
"...you put me in your act."

516
00:33:52,316 --> 00:33:53,943
You know what I'm gonna do?

517
00:33:54,018 --> 00:33:56,452
You're gonna pay that talented cow
and not us.

518
00:33:56,587 --> 00:33:59,181
I'm not payin' anybody
but I'm takin' that cow's advice.

519
00:33:59,257 --> 00:34:02,988
I'm gonna call the new act,
"Dainty June and Her Farm Boys."

520
00:34:03,227 --> 00:34:06,060
I'll put the cow in the act,
and Chowsie and the monkey.

521
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:09,827
Everybody works. Let me tell you this:
Kids, this is real big time.

522
00:34:09,901 --> 00:34:11,732
I really had an inspiration.

523
00:34:13,771 --> 00:34:15,329
No cooking, Mrs. Hovick.

524
00:34:15,406 --> 00:34:18,637
The very idea of entering
a woman's boudoir without knocking!

525
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:19,937
Where's your hot plate?

526
00:34:20,011 --> 00:34:24,072
- Where's your search warrant?
- In all my years running a theatrical hotel...

527
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:27,709
Leave, or your name'll be mud
throughout the entire theatrical profession.

528
00:34:27,785 --> 00:34:30,185
You know the rules. No cooking.

529
00:34:30,354 --> 00:34:32,481
No sterno stoves. No percolators.

530
00:34:32,623 --> 00:34:35,615
No electric irons turned upside down.
No dogs and no...

531
00:34:40,531 --> 00:34:45,093
Happy birthday, darling.
This is Herbie's birthday present to you.

532
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:46,996
Why, it's a damned zoo.

533
00:34:47,905 --> 00:34:51,341
Profanity in front of my babies.
June, get the Bible. Get the Bible.

534
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:54,776
I'll report you to the Board of Health,
and my friends. Hello, Gladys.

535
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:57,575
You can just pack up this menagerie
and get out of here!

536
00:34:57,648 --> 00:35:00,446
You'll have to throw us out,
you heartless animal hater.

537
00:35:00,518 --> 00:35:03,453
- Send for the SPCA.
- Send for the police.

538
00:35:03,554 --> 00:35:07,354
Why, I rented this producer's suite
to one adult and three children!

539
00:35:07,425 --> 00:35:11,088
Now I see one adult
and one, two, three, four...

540
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:14,528
You counted him twice.
It's a simple birthday party for my child.

541
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,760
One, two, three, four...

542
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:18,429
Stand still!

543
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,534
I'd offer you some chow mein,
but there's only one egg roll.

544
00:35:22,607 --> 00:35:25,440
One, two, three, four, five...

545
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,471
How many people are sleeping
in these rooms?

546
00:35:28,546 --> 00:35:30,411
- What rooms?
- This room, madam.

547
00:35:30,481 --> 00:35:32,415
Why there isn't a soul in this room.

548
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,819
- Now, you know what I mean.
- Except you and me, honey.

549
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,681
Mr. Kringelein, what are you tryin' to do?

550
00:35:38,756 --> 00:35:40,656
Stop! Help! Help!

551
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:43,017
Mr. Kringelein, stop! Help!

552
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:47,860
- Oh, my babies!
- Mama!

553
00:35:51,035 --> 00:35:53,333
A peeping tom. A monster.

554
00:35:53,537 --> 00:35:55,801
Oh, my babies! My babies!

555
00:35:55,873 --> 00:35:57,067
Get her some water.

556
00:35:57,141 --> 00:35:59,666
Gladys, a simple little birthday party.

557
00:35:59,877 --> 00:36:02,710
Chow mein. A tiny little cake.

558
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:05,315
Thank you, darling. Can you imagine?

559
00:36:05,783 --> 00:36:07,842
These dangerous middle-aged men.

560
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:11,054
You never know what sort of beasts
and brutes you'll meet...

561
00:36:11,122 --> 00:36:12,419
Rose, what happened?

562
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,549
Mr. Kringelein, the hotel manager,
tried to...

563
00:36:14,625 --> 00:36:15,557
Again?

564
00:36:15,626 --> 00:36:19,619
I had to do something, Herbie.
And don't you dare apologize to him.

565
00:36:20,831 --> 00:36:22,958
I hope it didn't spoil Louise's birthday.

566
00:36:23,034 --> 00:36:25,025
Why should it? Thank you, everyone.

567
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:28,037
- Back to your rooms now.
- Yes, thank you. Thank you.

568
00:36:28,773 --> 00:36:29,762
You, too.

569
00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:31,664
No.

570
00:36:32,543 --> 00:36:34,033
Rose, this is Mr. Goldstone.

571
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:37,103
Mr. Goldstone, the child has a birthday
once a year.

572
00:36:37,181 --> 00:36:39,411
We have a small party, a tiny little cake...

573
00:36:39,483 --> 00:36:41,576
The act is booked at the Tivoli Theater.

574
00:36:41,652 --> 00:36:44,018
...fried rice and subgum chow...

575
00:36:44,522 --> 00:36:46,683
Mr. Goldstone puts on
the Grantziger shows.

576
00:36:46,757 --> 00:36:48,520
He practically has the last word.

577
00:36:48,592 --> 00:36:50,958
We just have to show the act
to Mr. Grantziger.

578
00:36:51,028 --> 00:36:53,258
Mr. Goldstone says that's a cinch.

579
00:36:57,034 --> 00:37:00,834
"Have an egg roll, Mr. Goldstone

580
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:03,072
"Have a napkin
Have a chopstick

581
00:37:03,274 --> 00:37:04,468
"Have a chair

582
00:37:04,942 --> 00:37:08,434
"Have a sparerib, Mr. Goldstone

583
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:11,546
"Any sparerib that I can spare
I'd be glad to share

584
00:37:12,216 --> 00:37:14,150
"Have a dish

00:37:14,218 --> 00:37:15,981

"Have a smoke

"Would you like to hear a joke?
I'll have June recite a poem

589
00:37:26,897 --> 00:37:30,458
"Have a lichee, Mr. Goldstone

590
00:37:30,701 --> 00:37:33,431
"Tell me any little thing that I can do

"Have some fried rice, Mr. Soy Sauce

The won ton soup is better
in San Francisco.

636
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:39,275
The fu yung has more egg in it
in St. Louis.

637
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,977
But I will say New York City...

638
00:41:41,051 --> 00:41:44,418
...has got the best doggone,
subgum chicken chow mein I ever tasted.

639
00:41:44,488 --> 00:41:47,321
The onions are chopped good and fine.
Hand me that plate.

640
00:41:47,391 --> 00:41:48,483
Mother!

641
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:52,086
We're payin' for it, aren't we?
You'll get an ulcer like Herbie.

642
00:41:52,563 --> 00:41:54,758
Besides, what the dogs don't eat, we will.

643
00:41:54,832 --> 00:41:58,700
Did it ever occur to you there might be
someone who doesn't like Chinese food?

644
00:41:58,802 --> 00:42:01,600
Don't be silly! Who?
You like it, don't you, Herbie?

645
00:42:01,672 --> 00:42:03,162
Of course, I love it.

646
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,537
- Did she?
- Yes.

647
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:06,439
That's a healthy-wealthy lady-wady.

648
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,534
Oh, Lord!

649
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:09,806
Herbie's angry. He's chain-smoking.

650
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,041
Herbie's never angry. It's bad for his ulcer.
Come on now, girls, beddy-bye.

651
00:42:14,118 --> 00:42:15,483
But it's so early.

652
00:42:15,586 --> 00:42:20,148
Baby, tomorrow you're gonna audition for
Mr. T.T. Grantziger and his Tivoli Theater.

653
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,814
You gotta look young.

654
00:42:21,992 --> 00:42:23,152
Can I wear a dress?

655
00:42:23,227 --> 00:42:25,525
A dress'd make you look old,
and you don't own one.

656
00:42:25,596 --> 00:42:28,121
- Good night, Uncle Herbie.
- Good night, June.

657
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,566
- Good night, Louise.
- Good night, Herbie.

658
00:42:33,837 --> 00:42:36,101
I'll cold cream their faces
and be right back.

659
00:42:36,173 --> 00:42:38,198
The hotel is just two doors away.

660
00:42:38,275 --> 00:42:41,711
Honestly, the way you behave
with those girls. Rose!

661
00:42:42,012 --> 00:42:45,379
We need silverware for when we set up
housekeepin' on Riverside Drive.

662
00:42:45,449 --> 00:42:49,510
You're so high and mighty with a suite
at the Astor and you still steal the cutlery.

663
00:42:49,586 --> 00:42:51,520
You gotta grasp every opportunity.

664
00:42:51,588 --> 00:42:54,648
Herbie, how long is it gonna take you
to get used to me?

665
00:42:54,725 --> 00:42:57,125
How long did it take me
to get used to those coats?

666
00:42:57,194 --> 00:43:00,027
What's wrong with them?
Louise is very handy with a needle.

667
00:43:00,097 --> 00:43:02,827
As the Lord says,
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."

668
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,198
And it serves 'em right for overcharging.

669
00:43:13,744 --> 00:43:16,269
They can skip the cold cream for one night.

670
00:43:18,215 --> 00:43:21,309
All this time we've been together
and you still stand up for me.

671
00:43:21,385 --> 00:43:24,843
- It's instead of standing up to you.
- I hope the babies'll be all right.

672
00:43:24,922 --> 00:43:28,380
Rose, no matter how you dress them,
or smother them, they're not babies.

673
00:43:28,459 --> 00:43:31,622
- They're almost young women!
- They're not and they never will be!

674
00:43:31,695 --> 00:43:33,458
I'm embarrassed in front of them.

675
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:36,021
Why should you be?
You're almost their father.

676
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,126
- When are you going to marry me?
- Don't forget our scrapbooks...

677
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:42,969
- When are you going to quit stalling?
- When we're rolling in dough.

678
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,271
- Do you know there's a depression?
- Sure I know. I read Variety.

679
00:43:46,343 --> 00:43:48,208
You know what it's doing to vaudeville?

680
00:43:48,278 --> 00:43:51,839
Do you know what the talkies are doing
to vaudeville? Don't you know...

681
00:43:52,616 --> 00:43:53,844
...I love you?

682
00:43:54,184 --> 00:43:56,948
Do you think I'd be unfaithful
to my husbands if you didn't?

683
00:43:57,621 --> 00:43:59,646
I gotta think of my girls
and their happiness.

684
00:43:59,723 --> 00:44:02,248
Louise is some happy
being the front end of a cow.

685
00:44:02,326 --> 00:44:05,659
- It's better than the rear end.
- She and June should be in school.

686
00:44:05,729 --> 00:44:08,721
I promised June I'd get her
on the Pantages Circuit and I did.

687
00:44:08,799 --> 00:44:11,131
Honey, could I have a spoon to stir my tea?

688
00:44:11,502 --> 00:44:14,437
I promised her I'd get her
on the Orpheum Circuit and I will.

689
00:44:14,505 --> 00:44:17,804
I will. And you promised me
that after I do you'd marry me.

690
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:21,435
I promised myself she'd be a headliner
at the Tivoli Theater and she will.

691
00:44:21,512 --> 00:44:24,072
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes, but I'm ignoring it.

692
00:44:24,148 --> 00:44:25,410
Thanks, honey.

693
00:44:26,483 --> 00:44:31,147
Herbie, it isn't very polite of a gentleman
to remind a lady that she welched.

694
00:44:31,955 --> 00:44:34,185
Besides, there was no date
on that promise.

695
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:36,749
Will you stop handing me that?
Rose, sometimes...

696
00:44:36,827 --> 00:44:38,522
Your stomach!

697
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:42,190
Why don't you get angry on the outside
instead of lettin' it settle inside?

698
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:43,995
- I'm afraid.
- Of me?

699
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:45,731
No, of me. Me.

700
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:47,058
Why?

701
00:44:48,939 --> 00:44:52,602
If I ever let loose, it'll end up
with me picking up and walking.

702
00:44:56,547 --> 00:44:58,947
- Only around the block.
- Oh, no!

703
00:45:01,185 --> 00:45:02,243
Don't say that.

704
00:45:04,354 --> 00:45:08,757
"You'll never get away from me

705
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:11,755
"You can climb the tallest tree

706
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:14,620
"I'll be there somehow

707
00:45:16,466 --> 00:45:20,903
"True, you could say
'Hey, here's your hat'

708
00:45:21,438 --> 00:45:24,339
"But a little thing like that

709
00:45:24,675 --> 00:45:27,075
"Couldn't stop me now

710
00:45:28,979 --> 00:45:33,439
"I couldn't get away from you

711
00:45:33,951 --> 00:45:36,579
"Even if you told me to

712
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:42,114
"So go on and try, just try

713
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,524
"And you're gonna see

714
00:45:46,697 --> 00:45:50,633
"How you're gonna not at all

715
00:45:51,868 --> 00:45:56,862
"Get away from me"

716
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:03,272
What do you want?
There are better managers.

717
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:04,371
Not for me.

718
00:46:04,448 --> 00:46:06,075
- Even weaker men.
- Not for me.

719
00:46:06,149 --> 00:46:07,707
- Then what?
- You.

720
00:46:08,051 --> 00:46:11,418
Herbie, just go on helping me
like you've been helpin'.

721
00:46:11,989 --> 00:46:14,514
So you get the Tivoli, so what comes after?

722
00:46:14,758 --> 00:46:16,851
- Rose, what you expect...
- I'll get!

723
00:46:18,962 --> 00:46:21,487
And after I get it, I promise to marry you.

724
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,927
I even promise to keep my promise.

725
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:29,828
Herbie, I don't want anything
to upset that audition tomorrow...

726
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,532
...includin' your stomach.

727
00:46:38,482 --> 00:46:39,972
Yes, Mr. Grantziger.

728
00:46:40,517 --> 00:46:44,009
I know, but they're having a little difficulty
with their scenery.

729
00:46:44,087 --> 00:46:47,147
Well, wait till you see it.
I'm trying, Mr. Grantziger.

730
00:46:47,457 --> 00:46:49,516
Keep the tempo up now. Keep it bright.

731
00:46:49,626 --> 00:46:50,991
That's the mother.

732
00:46:51,395 --> 00:46:52,726
I have told her!

733
00:46:53,463 --> 00:46:55,021
Hello, Mr. Grantziger.

734
00:46:56,133 --> 00:46:59,364
- Where is he?
- He's in his office at the top of the theater.

735
00:46:59,436 --> 00:47:00,664
- Hi.
- We're ready now.

736
00:47:00,771 --> 00:47:03,137
It's a privilege to audition, Mr. Grantziger.

737
00:47:03,206 --> 00:47:04,730
You're gonna love us.

738
00:47:08,011 --> 00:47:09,273
"Extra, extra!

739
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:12,871
"Hey, look at the headlines
Historical news is being made

740
00:47:14,017 --> 00:47:15,348
"Extra, extra!

"They're drawing a red line
Around the biggest scoop of the decade

"Dainty June!"

747
00:47:41,611 --> 00:47:44,341
Hello, everybody. My name is June.

748
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:46,444
What's yours?

749
00:47:50,921 --> 00:47:53,651
"I have a moo cow, a new cow

750
00:47:53,824 --> 00:47:56,292
"A true cow named Caroline

"'Cause she loves me more"

757
00:49:07,931 --> 00:49:09,398
Yes, Mr. Grantziger?

758
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,764
Dainty June, would you
come out here, please?

759
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:16,970
Face front, dear.

760
00:49:19,075 --> 00:49:20,133
Profile.

761
00:49:21,311 --> 00:49:22,778
Yes, Mr. Grantziger.

762
00:49:23,346 --> 00:49:25,507
Thank you. That's all.

763
00:49:26,817 --> 00:49:28,682
But we've got a big dramatic finale.

764
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:31,550
- Sure. But he's seen quite enough.
- Hit it! Hit it!

765
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,490
"Broadway, Broadway!

766
00:49:37,194 --> 00:49:38,684
"We've missed it so

00:50:23,106 --> 00:50:24,630
Straighten that line!

Get this.

785
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,154
It's a train.

786
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:22,928
Goodbye, Caroline. I'll write to you.

787
00:51:24,234 --> 00:51:26,099
Don't forget to wire.

788
00:51:26,536 --> 00:51:27,935
Goodbye, Caroline.

789
00:51:28,605 --> 00:51:31,438
Goodbye. Don't forget to wire.

790
00:51:32,075 --> 00:51:33,770
Goodbye.

791
00:51:35,545 --> 00:51:37,706
'Bye. Goodbye. Wait!

792
00:51:37,881 --> 00:51:40,406
Stop the train. Stop everything.

793
00:51:40,917 --> 00:51:42,976
I can't go to Broadway with you.

794
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,484
Why not, Dainty June?

795
00:51:48,992 --> 00:51:50,323
Because...

796
00:51:51,428 --> 00:51:54,920
...everything in life that really matters
is right here.

797
00:51:55,765 --> 00:51:59,861
What care I for tinsel and glamour...

798
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:03,204
...when I have friendship and true love?

799
00:52:04,174 --> 00:52:06,404
I'm staying with Caroline.

800
00:52:40,477 --> 00:52:42,035
Yes, Mr. Grantziger?

801
00:52:42,946 --> 00:52:43,935
What?

802
00:52:45,548 --> 00:52:46,674
He liked it.

803
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:49,044
Well, of course he did.

804
00:52:49,552 --> 00:52:50,576
Yes, sir.

805
00:52:51,454 --> 00:52:54,048
Yes, Mr. Grantziger,
if that's what you want.

806
00:52:59,963 --> 00:53:03,956
If you and your tribe'll come up
to the office, I'll make out a contract.

807
00:53:05,535 --> 00:53:07,696
You won't be sorry, Mr. Grantziger.

808
00:53:09,372 --> 00:53:10,999
This is gonna make you!

809
00:53:13,209 --> 00:53:16,110
Miss Cratchitt, I believe Mr. Grantziger
made a mistake...

810
00:53:16,179 --> 00:53:18,170
...a slight mistake on this contract.

811
00:53:18,248 --> 00:53:19,078
So do I.

812
00:53:19,149 --> 00:53:21,242
- Happy, girls?
- Yes, Mama.

813
00:53:22,485 --> 00:53:26,319
We auditioned for Mr. Grantziger's Tivoli.
This is for Mr. Grantziger's Variety.

814
00:53:26,389 --> 00:53:28,289
- That's right.
- But the Variety is...

815
00:53:28,358 --> 00:53:30,155
...way down on 12th Street.

816
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,919
He'll give you a visa to get there.

817
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:35,453
Yes?

818
00:53:35,765 --> 00:53:37,824
- I'd like to talk to Mr. Grantziger.
- No!

819
00:53:37,901 --> 00:53:40,199
Now you can't disturb Mr. Grantziger.
Listen...

820
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:44,206
- I'm through listening. Where is he?
- He's still auditioning down on the stage.

821
00:53:44,274 --> 00:53:48,210
When we're down there he's up here,
and when we're up here he's down there.

822
00:53:48,678 --> 00:53:51,408
Mr. Grantziger is a very clever man.

823
00:53:52,716 --> 00:53:55,116
I'll go see if he's down on that stage.
This way?

824
00:53:55,185 --> 00:53:57,176
No. No, Rose. Wait.

825
00:53:57,921 --> 00:54:00,412
- We will wait right here.
- Herbie...

826
00:54:00,557 --> 00:54:05,085
Look, friend, strictly between us,
if I were you I'd sign that contract.

827
00:54:05,895 --> 00:54:09,331
There's only one item in that act of yours
that the boss likes.

828
00:54:09,499 --> 00:54:10,932
Dainty little June.

829
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:12,964
He thinks she can be an actress...

830
00:54:13,036 --> 00:54:15,402
...musical comedy, Broadway,
that sort of stuff.

831
00:54:15,472 --> 00:54:17,804
And he's right. That's great, isn't it, Rose?

832
00:54:17,907 --> 00:54:19,272
On one condition:

833
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:22,141
You stay away.

834
00:54:23,513 --> 00:54:25,845
Stay away? I'm her mother.

835
00:54:26,483 --> 00:54:27,916
You said it, I didn't.

836
00:54:28,251 --> 00:54:29,411
What about the act?

837
00:54:29,486 --> 00:54:31,181
One week at the Variety.

838
00:54:31,788 --> 00:54:34,018
After that, what about it? June is the act.

839
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:37,856
- This must be a private discussion.
- How are Louise and I supposed to live?

840
00:54:38,261 --> 00:54:39,990
You might get a job, dear.

841
00:54:41,698 --> 00:54:43,461
I have a job, dear.

842
00:54:44,033 --> 00:54:45,591
And I do it damn well!

843
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:48,963
This'd be much better
than vaudeville for June, and for us.

844
00:54:49,038 --> 00:54:52,132
- Nothing is better than vaudeville.
- Was better than vaudeville.

845
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:54,369
- Where's your values?
- Motherhood comes first.

846
00:54:54,444 --> 00:54:58,175
Then you ought to see that this is right.
You'll have June on the stage.

847
00:54:58,248 --> 00:55:01,581
I'll take care of you and Louise
and we'll all live like real people.

848
00:55:01,651 --> 00:55:04,552
Rose, this way we can have our cake
and eat it, too.

849
00:55:04,621 --> 00:55:05,747
Your cake!

850
00:55:06,422 --> 00:55:11,325
Besides, June wouldn't start all over again,
like some beginner.

851
00:55:12,262 --> 00:55:13,490
Ask her, Mama.

852
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:15,488
Ask her.

853
00:55:17,367 --> 00:55:20,803
Yes. Oh, Mama, yes. Please say yes.

854
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:23,669
I want to learn, to work.

855
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:27,604
I'll try so hard to make you
proud of me, Mama.

856
00:55:29,045 --> 00:55:30,478
Say yes, Mama.

857
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:38,910
No.

858
00:55:40,557 --> 00:55:42,354
And I am proud of you, Baby.

859
00:55:42,826 --> 00:55:45,727
You don't need lessons any more
than you need Grantziger.

860
00:55:45,795 --> 00:55:48,320
There's no one in show business
who doesn't need him.

861
00:55:48,398 --> 00:55:50,696
- Take a good look at this person.
- Rose.

862
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:52,632
They're so smart in New York.

863
00:55:53,269 --> 00:55:55,203
New York is the center of everything.

864
00:55:55,572 --> 00:55:57,403
New York is the center of New York.

865
00:55:57,607 --> 00:55:59,939
The country's full of people
who know people...

866
00:56:00,009 --> 00:56:02,239
...who know what a mother means
to her daughter.

867
00:56:02,312 --> 00:56:05,770
Hicks like you don't know.
And Grantziger's a hick! He'll get no place.

868
00:56:05,849 --> 00:56:07,373
Do you hear me, keep still!

869
00:56:07,851 --> 00:56:11,048
Don't you dare answer that phone
when I'm yellin' at you.

870
00:56:13,323 --> 00:56:14,756
Did you hear what I said?

871
00:56:14,824 --> 00:56:18,351
They're tryin' to take my baby from me.
Over my dead body they will!

872
00:56:18,428 --> 00:56:22,023
- Come on, we'll go down and tell him.
- Just a minute, Mrs. Hovick!

873
00:56:23,733 --> 00:56:24,893
Mrs. Hovick!

874
00:56:29,939 --> 00:56:31,429
Don't worry, kids...

875
00:56:32,008 --> 00:56:34,943
...I will read her
the Declaration of Independence.

876
00:56:35,278 --> 00:56:36,370
Believe me.

877
00:56:37,013 --> 00:56:39,948
It's not your fault, Herbie,
it's just the way it is.

878
00:56:40,483 --> 00:56:43,714
Well, I'm gonna try to change the way it is.
Just you wait.

879
00:56:50,894 --> 00:56:51,883
No!

880
00:56:55,899 --> 00:56:59,892
Mama's just talking angry, June.
She won't really spoil anything.

881
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:01,728
Yes, she will.

882
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:04,664
I'll never be anything but Baby.

883
00:57:05,108 --> 00:57:07,042
Dainty old Baby June.

884
00:57:08,444 --> 00:57:12,505
Well, aren't ya happy that somebody
like Mr. T.T. Grantziger thinks...

885
00:57:12,582 --> 00:57:14,482
...you can be a real actress?

886
00:57:14,884 --> 00:57:16,317
I would be happy...

887
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,750
...if Mama would only see
what this means to me.

888
00:57:20,223 --> 00:57:23,556
I'm going to be awfully unhappy
remembering how I lost this chance.

889
00:57:24,027 --> 00:57:26,757
Mama made you a vaudeville star
and she can do it again.

890
00:57:26,829 --> 00:57:28,456
Vaudeville is gone, Louise.

891
00:57:28,665 --> 00:57:29,723
It's over.

892
00:57:29,933 --> 00:57:32,925
The only show business left
is right here on Broadway.

893
00:57:34,304 --> 00:57:38,536
I want to learn to be part of it.
Part of this kind of show business.

894
00:57:39,309 --> 00:57:41,402
You can be anything you want.

895
00:57:42,111 --> 00:57:44,102
You were born for this business.

896
00:57:44,514 --> 00:57:46,539
You're a real stage personality.

897
00:57:48,751 --> 00:57:50,582
You're really wonderful, Louise.

898
00:57:51,754 --> 00:57:52,914
I am? Why?

899
00:57:53,957 --> 00:57:55,948
Because, well, I don't know.

900
00:57:56,826 --> 00:58:00,193
When it comes to the act,
you never worry about yourself...

901
00:58:01,497 --> 00:58:02,759
...only for me.

902
00:58:03,766 --> 00:58:06,758
I don't have any talent.
It doesn't really matter.

903
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:10,168
It's just that Mama would
like it better if I did.

904
00:58:15,545 --> 00:58:19,311
Your mother isn't feeling well.
I'm gonna take her back to the hotel.

905
00:58:26,222 --> 00:58:28,816
Don't worry, kids, I'll figure something out.

906
00:58:37,767 --> 00:58:40,361
More than ever I wish
Mama would marry Herbie.

907
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:42,863
And then we could all be together.

908
00:58:44,173 --> 00:58:47,472
"If Mama was married
We'd live in a house

909
00:58:47,877 --> 00:58:51,244
"As private as private can be

910
00:58:51,547 --> 00:58:54,277
"Just Mama, three ducks, five canaries

911
00:58:54,384 --> 00:58:59,412
"A mouse, two monkeys, one father
six turtles and me

912
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:03,458
"If Mama was married

913
00:59:05,828 --> 00:59:09,423
"If Mama was married
I'd jump in the air

914
00:59:09,632 --> 00:59:12,795
"And give all my toe shoes to you

915
00:59:13,369 --> 00:59:16,896
"I'd get all these hair ribbons
Out of my hair

916
00:59:17,206 --> 00:59:21,040
"And once and for all
I'd get Mama out, too

917
00:59:22,945 --> 00:59:25,311
"If Mama was married

918
00:59:28,317 --> 00:59:31,343
"Mama, get out your white dress

919
00:59:31,521 --> 00:59:33,216
"You've done it before

920
00:59:33,356 --> 00:59:35,119
"Without much success

921
00:59:35,725 --> 00:59:38,888
"Mama, Godspeed and God bless

922
00:59:39,162 --> 00:59:40,891
"We're not keeping score

923
00:59:41,164 --> 00:59:42,995
"What's one more or less

924
00:59:45,468 --> 00:59:46,935
"Oh, Mama, say yes

925
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:50,498
"And waltz down the aisle while you may

926
00:59:51,107 --> 00:59:53,132
"I'll gladly support you

927
00:59:53,242 --> 00:59:55,301
"I'll even escort you

928
00:59:55,378 --> 00:59:58,142
"And I'll gladly give you away

929
00:59:59,115 --> 01:00:03,779
"Oh, Mama, get married today

930
01:00:06,889 --> 01:00:11,019
"If Mama was married
There wouldn't be any more

931
01:00:11,094 --> 01:00:14,393
"'Let me entertain you

932
01:00:14,997 --> 01:00:17,864
"'Let me make you smile

933
01:00:19,035 --> 01:00:20,969
"'I will do some kicks

934
01:00:22,872 --> 01:00:24,840
"'I will do some tricks'

935
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:26,440
"'Sing out, Louise!

936
01:00:28,311 --> 01:00:29,642
"'Smile, Baby.'

937
01:00:32,081 --> 01:00:35,312
"Mama, please take our advice

938
01:00:35,585 --> 01:00:37,246
"We aren't the Lunts

939
01:00:37,453 --> 01:00:39,148
"I'm not Fanny Brice

01:00:39,655 --> 01:00:42,954
"Mama, we'll buy you the rice

941
01:00:43,159 --> 01:00:44,751
"If only this once

01:00:45,061 --> 01:00:46,995
"You wouldn't think twice

"Oh, Mama

951
01:01:19,762 --> 01:01:22,230
"Get married today"

952
01:01:28,538 --> 01:01:30,403
How do you like those kids?

953
01:01:30,473 --> 01:01:33,931
They knew darn well I'd marry Herbie
at the right time and place.

954
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:36,906
But 12th Street sure wasn't
what I had in mind.

955
01:01:36,979 --> 01:01:39,709
So what if the act is a little shabby
right now?

956
01:01:39,782 --> 01:01:43,183
Instead of buyin' longer costumes,
I'm gonna get shorter boys.

957
01:01:43,319 --> 01:01:45,219
And that goes for Tulsa, too.

958
01:01:46,055 --> 01:01:47,386
All that jiggin'.

959
01:02:01,771 --> 01:02:05,673
Say, that's pretty fancy footwork, Tulsa.
Why don't you show it to Mrs. Hovick?

960
01:02:05,741 --> 01:02:07,436
It's just fooling around.

961
01:02:08,311 --> 01:02:11,508
Well, you started fooling around
about three months ago.

962
01:02:12,014 --> 01:02:14,175
He had to do something during the layoffs.

963
01:02:15,418 --> 01:02:17,750
I thought maybe you were worried
about the act.

964
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:21,950
Because the way things are pickin' up,
I wouldn't be surprised if you kids got paid.

965
01:02:22,024 --> 01:02:25,551
Things are lookin' so good I might even
treat you to an ice-cream soda.

966
01:02:26,362 --> 01:02:27,590
No, thank you.

967
01:02:28,898 --> 01:02:29,990
Chow mein?

968
01:02:31,567 --> 01:02:33,330
Baby Ruth? Butterfinger?

969
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:37,639
Mama doesn't like us to eat
just before a show.

970
01:02:38,708 --> 01:02:42,144
We don't always have to do
what your mama likes, do we, Louise?

971
01:02:45,848 --> 01:02:46,837
Herbie?

972
01:02:52,321 --> 01:02:53,583
Oh, nothing.

973
01:02:56,759 --> 01:03:00,786
Tulsa, if you and the boys have
any problems just bring them to me, huh?

974
01:03:02,098 --> 01:03:03,156
Sure, Herbie.

975
01:03:10,973 --> 01:03:13,840
You can't blame him
for tryin' to act like a big shot.

976
01:03:13,909 --> 01:03:15,740
Everybody knows he's just a stooge.

977
01:03:16,946 --> 01:03:18,174
He is not.

978
01:03:19,515 --> 01:03:21,244
I mean, we all depend on him.

979
01:03:21,317 --> 01:03:23,046
I like Herbie. We all do.

980
01:03:25,521 --> 01:03:29,116
You didn't tell him, did you?
I mean, that you're rehearsing for a team?

981
01:03:29,392 --> 01:03:30,984
How did you know I was?

982
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:34,723
I saw you practicing last Monday
after the matinee. I was up in the flies.

983
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:37,765
I wouldn't tell anybody, Tulsa, honest.

984
01:03:39,335 --> 01:03:41,394
I'm very secretive, just like you.

985
01:03:45,574 --> 01:03:46,563
Look...

986
01:03:47,877 --> 01:03:48,866
See?

987
01:03:49,645 --> 01:03:51,943
That's what that means in your palm.

988
01:03:52,281 --> 01:03:53,270
And...

989
01:03:54,317 --> 01:03:56,615
...this means that you make up dreams.

990
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,317
Just like me. See?

991
01:04:01,757 --> 01:04:03,691
And what do you make up dreams about?

992
01:04:09,532 --> 01:04:10,521
People.

993
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,497
I do that, too.

994
01:04:14,503 --> 01:04:17,529
Yes, but yours are about
a partner for your act.

995
01:04:17,907 --> 01:04:20,398
She's gonna be more than a partner,
I hope.

996
01:04:22,078 --> 01:04:23,443
I mean, I dream...

997
01:04:28,317 --> 01:04:29,579
Well, you know.

998
01:04:32,388 --> 01:04:34,549
What would she have to be like, Tulsa?

999
01:04:35,524 --> 01:04:37,822
A real wonderful dancer
and a singer, I guess.

1000
01:04:38,294 --> 01:04:42,458
Oh, no. I'm gonna do most of that.
I don't mean I'm gonna hog it all, but...

1001
01:04:42,598 --> 01:04:45,499
Well, they always look at the girl
on a dance team.

1002
01:04:45,601 --> 01:04:47,262
Especially if she's pretty.

1003
01:04:50,673 --> 01:04:53,506
Makeup could help, and costumes.

1004
01:04:54,276 --> 01:04:57,404
I've got the costumes all figured out.
A blue satin tux for me.

1005
01:04:58,881 --> 01:05:00,212
With rhinestone lapels?

1006
01:05:00,883 --> 01:05:01,941
You think?

1007
01:05:02,184 --> 01:05:03,276
I'll sew 'em on.

1008
01:05:03,352 --> 01:05:07,186
Okay. Thanks. Well, you see, I pretend...
Oh, this is a mirror.

1009
01:05:08,391 --> 01:05:10,621
I take a comb and comb my hair.

1010
01:05:11,594 --> 01:05:12,959
Take a flower...

1011
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:15,492
...smell it...

1012
01:05:15,931 --> 01:05:17,660
...and put it in my lapel.

1013
01:05:18,634 --> 01:05:20,534
And then I spot the audience.

1014
01:05:21,203 --> 01:05:23,763
"Once my clothes were shabby

1015
01:05:23,873 --> 01:05:26,341
"Tailors called me 'Cabbie'

1016
01:05:26,409 --> 01:05:28,809
"So I took a vow

1017
01:05:29,111 --> 01:05:31,636
"Said, 'This bum'll be Beau Brummel'

1018
01:05:31,714 --> 01:05:33,944
"Now I'm smooth and snappy

1019
01:05:34,049 --> 01:05:36,517
"Now my tailor's happy

1020
01:05:36,585 --> 01:05:38,576
"I'm the cat's meow

1021
01:05:38,888 --> 01:05:41,379
"My wardrobe is a wow!

1022
01:05:41,957 --> 01:05:43,447
"Paris silk

1023
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:46,325
"Harrod's tweed

1024
01:05:47,163 --> 01:05:50,360
"There's only one thing I need

1025
01:05:51,834 --> 01:05:54,394
"Got my tweed pressed

1026
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:56,995
"Got my best vest

1027
01:05:57,139 --> 01:05:59,767
"All I need now

1028
01:05:59,842 --> 01:06:01,833
"Is the girl

1029
01:06:02,912 --> 01:06:05,380
"Got my striped tie

1030
01:06:05,514 --> 01:06:08,108
"Got my hopes high

1031
01:06:08,217 --> 01:06:11,812
"Got the time and the place
And I got rhythm

1032
01:06:11,954 --> 01:06:14,821
"Now all I need's a girl to go with 'em

1033
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:18,255
"If she'll just appear

1034
01:06:18,828 --> 01:06:23,822
"We'll take this big town for a whirl

1035
01:06:25,668 --> 01:06:30,037
"And if she'll say
'My darling, I'm yours'

1036
01:06:30,105 --> 01:06:33,506
"I'll throw away my striped tie

1037
01:06:33,609 --> 01:06:36,407
"And my best pressed tweed

1038
01:06:36,812 --> 01:06:41,078
"All I really need is the girl"

1039
01:06:48,424 --> 01:06:50,119
I start easy, you see.

1040
01:06:55,464 --> 01:06:57,659
Now I'm more debonair.

1041
01:07:12,548 --> 01:07:13,537
Break.

1042
01:07:17,753 --> 01:07:19,220
And I sell it here.

1043
01:07:20,856 --> 01:07:22,483
I start this step, see.

1044
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:25,927
And then I build it.

1045
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:29,120
And now I double it.

1046
01:07:34,603 --> 01:07:36,400
She appears all in white.

1047
01:07:38,274 --> 01:07:40,936
I take her hand...

1048
01:07:41,777 --> 01:07:43,108
...and I kiss it.

1049
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,312
And lead her on the floor.

1050
01:08:06,969 --> 01:08:09,096
This step is good for the costume.

1051
01:08:14,109 --> 01:08:15,235
Astaire bit.

1052
01:08:26,288 --> 01:08:29,052
"Now we waltz

1053
01:08:29,925 --> 01:08:32,086
"Strings come in"

1054
01:08:49,645 --> 01:08:50,976
And I lift her.

1055
01:08:53,649 --> 01:08:54,638
Again.

1056
01:08:57,953 --> 01:08:59,284
Once more.

1057
01:09:13,402 --> 01:09:15,233
And now the tempo changes...

1058
01:09:16,271 --> 01:09:18,262
...and all the lights come up...

1059
01:09:19,308 --> 01:09:22,402
...and I build for the finale.

1060
01:09:24,313 --> 01:09:26,577
Louise, that's it. Over here.

1061
01:09:27,049 --> 01:09:28,380
Give me your hand.

1062
01:09:29,051 --> 01:09:30,416
Now follow me.

1063
01:09:31,286 --> 01:09:33,618
That's it, Louise. Now do it faster.

1064
01:09:34,757 --> 01:09:36,588
That's it. Now the front.

1065
01:09:37,626 --> 01:09:38,752
Do it again.

1066
01:09:40,229 --> 01:09:41,526
Do it again.

1067
01:09:42,898 --> 01:09:43,887
Turn.

1068
01:09:45,534 --> 01:09:46,523
Louise.

1069
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:04,981
So okay, they keep on makin' garages
out of vaudeville houses...

1070
01:10:05,054 --> 01:10:07,579
...and bowling alleys and stuff like that.

1071
01:10:07,956 --> 01:10:09,514
But kill vaudeville?

1072
01:10:09,591 --> 01:10:13,083
Did you ever hear such banana oil?
There was still Omaha.

1073
01:10:13,662 --> 01:10:16,028
So we were a smash, like usual.

1074
01:10:16,432 --> 01:10:19,799
And then made tracks
for a sensational engagement in Dallas.

1075
01:10:20,636 --> 01:10:22,866
As we waited for the train I was high.

1076
01:10:22,971 --> 01:10:26,065
Just had a feelin' everything
was gonna be dipsy-doodle.

1077
01:10:26,275 --> 01:10:30,302
You know how you are sometimes.
There'sjust somethin' in the air.

1078
01:10:31,714 --> 01:10:33,579
Have you guys seen Louise and June?

1079
01:10:33,649 --> 01:10:35,617
Where's Jerry and Joe?
Why's everyone late?

1080
01:10:35,684 --> 01:10:37,117
We'd like to talk to you.

1081
01:10:37,186 --> 01:10:39,711
Let me find out whether
the train's on time.

1082
01:10:40,589 --> 01:10:42,557
Is the southbound train on schedule?

1083
01:10:42,624 --> 01:10:45,320
I wouldn't say it is
and I wouldn't say it ain't.

1084
01:10:45,394 --> 01:10:49,592
- I will say you got time for a bowl of chili.
- Thanks. We have a short wait.

1085
01:10:49,965 --> 01:10:53,526
- Why don't you get a cup of java?
- We ain't goin' to Dallas, we're quitting.

1086
01:10:53,602 --> 01:10:56,036
You've been threatening that for years.

1087
01:10:56,105 --> 01:10:58,596
- No, this is the truth.
- We're not kidding.

1088
01:11:00,876 --> 01:11:02,241
Tell her, Herbie.

1089
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,638
The boys are kind of unhappy.

1090
01:11:08,083 --> 01:11:09,914
Not serious. I'll straighten it out.

1091
01:11:09,985 --> 01:11:12,954
- You can't straighten it out.
- Mrs. Hovick, we're finished.

1092
01:11:13,021 --> 01:11:16,149
We want our railroad tickets.
We're going in the other direction.

1093
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,927
- You're walkin' out on the act?
- They don't mean anything of the kind.

1094
01:11:21,997 --> 01:11:24,795
They're just kids and every once in a while
they get upset.

1095
01:11:24,867 --> 01:11:28,098
When they get upset, I get upset.
And I don't like it.

1096
01:11:29,104 --> 01:11:32,369
Shut your traps.
Now where are June and Louise?

1097
01:11:32,841 --> 01:11:34,706
I shouldn't have let 'em go to the movies.

1098
01:11:34,777 --> 01:11:37,143
They're crazy about John Gilbert.
I couldn't refuse.

1099
01:11:37,212 --> 01:11:39,510
Mrs. Hovick, you've got to believe us.

1100
01:11:39,715 --> 01:11:42,513
It's nothing personal,
but we're quitting the act.

1101
01:11:43,118 --> 01:11:45,484
I told you in Klamath Falls
I didn't want boys.

1102
01:11:45,554 --> 01:11:47,249
They're troublemakers.

1103
01:11:47,322 --> 01:11:50,723
But we got boys, Rose.
Just let me talk to them, will you?

1104
01:11:51,593 --> 01:11:55,222
Fellas, Angie, I've always been your friend,
haven't I? So give a listen.

1105
01:11:55,297 --> 01:11:59,961
Now don't lower yourself to argue, Herbie.
These rats wanna quit the act, let 'em quit.

1106
01:12:00,736 --> 01:12:03,398
They want their railroad tickets,
give 'em bus tickets.

1107
01:12:03,472 --> 01:12:05,633
- What's keepin' the girls?
- We got lots of time.

1108
01:12:05,707 --> 01:12:09,040
Fellas, I know we've had
a couple of layoffs in the past...

1109
01:12:09,111 --> 01:12:11,375
It isn't that, Herbie. We're too old.

1110
01:12:13,148 --> 01:12:17,244
Would you be too old
if we could increase your salary?

1111
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,610
Increase what salary?

1112
01:12:19,688 --> 01:12:21,781
- Herbie's been payin' us...
- Moron!

1113
01:12:22,758 --> 01:12:25,556
How long will it take you
to get used to me, Rose?

1114
01:12:25,994 --> 01:12:26,865
Button your coat.

1115
01:12:26,866 --> 01:12:27,360
Button your coat.

1116
01:12:28,264 --> 01:12:32,064
Ingrates! You take the bread out of
that man's mouth and spit it in his face.

1117
01:12:32,135 --> 01:12:34,695
As the good Lord says,
"Good riddance to bad rubbish."

1118
01:12:34,771 --> 01:12:37,501
Give 'em the tickets.
They were sluffin' the act anyway.

1119
01:12:39,542 --> 01:12:41,271
Okay. Okay.

1120
01:12:43,112 --> 01:12:45,910
Thanks, Herbie. We'd also like Joe's ticket.

1121
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:48,317
Joe's leaving, too?

1122
01:12:49,152 --> 01:12:50,813
That leaves us just with Jerry.

1123
01:12:50,887 --> 01:12:54,015
Well, not exactly. Jerry's already gone.
On his own.

1124
01:12:54,490 --> 01:12:55,514
Where you been?

1125
01:12:55,592 --> 01:12:58,652
Where's the baby? You didn't let her stay
for the second show?

1126
01:12:58,828 --> 01:13:00,819
- No, we didn't go to the show.
- What?

1127
01:13:00,897 --> 01:13:03,365
I've been looking for the baby
all over the place.

1128
01:13:03,433 --> 01:13:06,994
I finally went to the hotel and
the room clerk gave me this note for you.

1129
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:09,004
- What's she writing me for?
- I don't know.

1130
01:13:09,072 --> 01:13:11,233
- What's in it?
- I'll read it to you.

1131
01:13:13,109 --> 01:13:15,373
I can read my own letters, thank you.

1132
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:19,470
"Mama...

1133
01:13:20,183 --> 01:13:21,775
"...l've had a dream. Me.

1134
01:13:22,318 --> 01:13:24,013
"My dream was like a nightmare.

1135
01:13:24,087 --> 01:13:27,614
"I dreamed I was a very old lady,
but I was still Dainty June...

1136
01:13:27,857 --> 01:13:29,825
"...still doin' the same old act.

1137
01:13:29,893 --> 01:13:32,862
"I was so ashamed of myself,
I ran away, Mama...

1138
01:13:32,996 --> 01:13:35,226
"...from the act, from you,
from your dreams...

1139
01:13:35,298 --> 01:13:37,289
"...because they only made you happy.

1140
01:13:37,367 --> 01:13:41,269
"And if I want a dream of my own,
my very own, I have to be like you, Mama.

1141
01:13:41,337 --> 01:13:42,929
"I have to fight for it.

1142
01:13:43,006 --> 01:13:46,567
"I started toward my dream
three weeks ago in between shows.

1143
01:13:53,149 --> 01:13:54,582
"I married Jerry.

1144
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:21,739
"Please don't worry about me, Mama.

1145
01:14:22,512 --> 01:14:27,142
"Maybe I'm enough like you
to make my dream come true...

1146
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:30,614
"...to grow up and be a real actress.

1147
01:14:31,854 --> 01:14:36,120
"I'll always love you and Louise, Mama...

1148
01:14:37,226 --> 01:14:40,992
"...and I'll always be grateful to Herbie.

1149
01:14:42,298 --> 01:14:43,287
"June."

1150
01:14:48,104 --> 01:14:51,005
When did they leave?
Did she tell you where they were going?

1151
01:14:51,074 --> 01:14:53,372
No. Nothing, honest.

1152
01:14:54,777 --> 01:14:59,077
I'll call the cops. They'll find 'em, Rose,
and bring 'em back. Don't you worry.

1153
01:14:59,148 --> 01:15:01,548
You shouldn't call the cops.
They'll scare June.

1154
01:15:01,617 --> 01:15:05,075
It's gotta be against the law
for a 13-year-old to be marryin'.

1155
01:15:06,155 --> 01:15:08,521
Rose, she must have lied about her age.

1156
01:15:11,294 --> 01:15:13,023
I'm gonna call the police.

1157
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:16,697
I'd better get her ammonia.
I think it's in her valise.

1158
01:15:19,002 --> 01:15:21,470
Can I use your phone?
I've gotta call the police.

1159
01:15:24,874 --> 01:15:27,604
This little girl, underage,
who married a boy...

1160
01:15:28,745 --> 01:15:32,146
- How old are they, mister?
- The girl's 13. The boy is 17, 18.

1161
01:15:32,248 --> 01:15:35,046
There's nothing illegal about that
in this state.

1162
01:15:35,118 --> 01:15:38,747
It's legal for a girl of 12
and legal for a boy at 16.

1163
01:15:39,188 --> 01:15:42,282
This is pioneer country
and we've never changed the law.

1164
01:15:43,426 --> 01:15:45,018
I still want to call the cops.

1165
01:15:45,094 --> 01:15:46,186
Come on in.

1166
01:15:46,262 --> 01:15:48,924
You won't hear any different
from them than me.

1167
01:15:50,066 --> 01:15:52,500
Can we have the tickets now?
We gotta get movin'.

1168
01:15:52,568 --> 01:15:53,694
Police department.

1169
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:56,364
- I fixed up an act of my own...
- Get moving.

1170
01:15:56,439 --> 01:15:59,875
Don't be sore, Herbie.
It ain't our fault the act's washed up.

1171
01:16:03,346 --> 01:16:04,711
Goodbye, Herbie.

1172
01:16:05,081 --> 01:16:06,343
Hey, fellas...

1173
01:16:07,483 --> 01:16:08,507
...good luck.

1174
01:16:09,152 --> 01:16:12,053
- Thanks, Herbie.
- Thanks. Good luck to you, too, Herbie.

1175
01:16:12,121 --> 01:16:13,349
Good luck, Louise.

1176
01:16:19,062 --> 01:16:20,427
Come on, Yonkers.

1177
01:16:23,032 --> 01:16:24,226
Goodbye, Louise.

1178
01:16:29,639 --> 01:16:30,628
Goodbye?

1179
01:16:31,774 --> 01:16:34,174
You mean you're all going away?

1180
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:38,603
Yeah, all of us. Gee, I'm sick about it,
but I gotta think of my future.

1181
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:42,742
Why didn't you tell me, Tulsa?

1182
01:16:42,819 --> 01:16:47,051
Like you once said, Louise, it's in my palm.
I keep secrets the way you do.

1183
01:16:47,557 --> 01:16:50,253
Listen, I would've loved June
to be my partner.

1184
01:16:53,529 --> 01:16:54,518
I know.

1185
01:16:56,933 --> 01:16:58,491
You'll find another one.

1186
01:16:58,568 --> 01:16:59,762
What will you do?

1187
01:17:01,304 --> 01:17:02,293
I don't know.

1188
01:17:02,371 --> 01:17:06,603
Well, I hope we run into each other again.
Maybe we'll even play on the same bill.

1189
01:17:06,676 --> 01:17:08,371
Yeah. Maybe.

1190
01:17:08,911 --> 01:17:11,311
You're a great girl.
You're the cat's whiskers.

1191
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:14,577
That's what we all say.
You're just like one of the boys.

1192
01:17:15,485 --> 01:17:18,511
Yeah, that's me all right.
"One of the boys."

1193
01:17:20,957 --> 01:17:21,946
Thanks, Tulsa.

1194
01:17:26,362 --> 01:17:30,196
I just talked to the authorities.
There's no way we can get June back.

1195
01:17:31,734 --> 01:17:32,962
What're we gonna do?

1196
01:17:34,637 --> 01:17:35,626
Rose.

1197
01:17:37,406 --> 01:17:39,306
Rose. Honey, listen.

1198
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:44,903
I'm still in the candy business.
It's steady, 52 weeks a year, every year.

1199
01:17:44,981 --> 01:17:48,348
I'll be a district manager.
We can stay put, have a home of our own.

1200
01:17:48,417 --> 01:17:49,941
Louise can go to school.

1201
01:17:51,454 --> 01:17:52,443
Rose?

1202
01:17:57,226 --> 01:17:58,887
Rose, you still got Herbie.

1203
01:17:59,529 --> 01:18:02,896
You can marry me and I promise
you won't have one single worry...

1204
01:18:02,965 --> 01:18:05,456
...for the rest of your life.
Don't you want that?

1205
01:18:08,471 --> 01:18:12,032
Yes. Oh, Mama, say yes.

1206
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:15,340
Herbie.

1207
01:18:15,912 --> 01:18:19,973
You read palms, I read minds. It's okay.
It's all gonna be fine now, honey.

1208
01:18:20,283 --> 01:18:23,684
Everything happens for the best.
Okay, so the act is finished.

1209
01:18:23,819 --> 01:18:25,912
But you and me and our daughter...

1210
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:30,985
...we're gonna have a home of our own.
We even got a cow for the backyard.

1211
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:34,257
We're gonna be the best
damned homebodies you ever saw.

1212
01:18:35,264 --> 01:18:38,290
The boys walked because they think
the act's finished.

1213
01:18:38,834 --> 01:18:40,563
They think we're nothin'.

1214
01:18:41,204 --> 01:18:44,662
Well, let 'em walk. Let 'em all walk.
I don't need any of 'em.

1215
01:18:46,175 --> 01:18:47,267
They needed me.

1216
01:18:48,844 --> 01:18:50,835
I'm used to people walkin' out.

1217
01:18:51,547 --> 01:18:55,449
When my own mother did it,
I cried for a week. Your father did it.

1218
01:18:56,819 --> 01:18:59,219
Then the man I married after him did it.

1219
01:19:00,456 --> 01:19:02,447
Well, this time I'm not cryin'.

1220
01:19:03,025 --> 01:19:05,016
Because I don't need any of 'em.

1221
01:19:05,695 --> 01:19:07,185
I'm the electricity.

1222
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:10,164
I was always the electricity.
Who do you think made the act?

1223
01:19:10,233 --> 01:19:13,600
I made it! And I can make it again.
And I will, I swear I will.

1224
01:19:16,839 --> 01:19:18,966
This time I'm gonna do it for you.

1225
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:23,435
This time I'm gonna make you a star, baby.

1226
01:19:24,313 --> 01:19:27,942
We're gonna have all new costumes,
all new people, all new everything.

1227
01:19:28,017 --> 01:19:31,214
It's like bein' born all over again.
We got everything ahead of us.

1228
01:19:31,287 --> 01:19:32,777
Take a look at our new star.

1229
01:19:32,855 --> 01:19:34,482
Look at her, Herbie. Look at her.
You're right.

1230
01:19:36,474 --> 01:19:39,500
This is today and everything else
is yesterday's mashed potatoes.

1231
01:19:39,611 --> 01:19:44,412
Finished? Why, we're just beginning.
And this time nothing's gonna stop us.

1232
01:19:50,055 --> 01:19:52,148
"I had a dream

1233
01:19:53,391 --> 01:19:56,656
"A dream about you, baby

1234
01:19:57,629 --> 01:20:01,030
"It's gonna come true, baby

1235
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,930
"They think that we're through

1236
01:20:05,403 --> 01:20:08,372
"But, baby

1237
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:13,240
"You'll be swell, you'll be great

1238
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:16,809
"Gonna have the whole world on a plate

1239
01:20:17,515 --> 01:20:20,450
"Startin' here, startin' now

1240
01:20:21,219 --> 01:20:26,156
"Honey, everything's comin' up roses

1241
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:31,327
"Clear the decks, clear the tracks

1242
01:20:31,997 --> 01:20:34,864
"You got nothin' to do but relax

1243
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,569
"Blow a kiss, take a bow

1244
01:20:39,337 --> 01:20:44,138
"Honey, everything's comin' up roses

1245
01:20:46,911 --> 01:20:49,971
"Now's your inning

1246
01:20:50,849 --> 01:20:53,409
"Stand the world on its ear

1247
01:20:54,152 --> 01:20:56,985
"Set it spinning

1248
01:20:57,722 --> 01:21:00,555
"That'll be just the beginning

1249
01:21:00,625 --> 01:21:03,458
"Curtain up, light the lights

1250
01:21:04,262 --> 01:21:07,026
"You've got nothin' to hit but the heights

1251
01:21:07,832 --> 01:21:10,528
"You'll be swell, you'll be great

1252
01:21:11,403 --> 01:21:14,338
"I can tell, just you wait

1253
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:19,841
"That lucky star I talk about is due

01:21:22,213 --> 01:21:27,082
"Honey, everything's comin' up roses

01:21:27,752 --> 01:21:30,778
"For me and for you

1256
01:21:34,959 --> 01:21:37,291
"You can do it

1257
01:21:38,997 --> 01:21:40,931
"All you need is a hand

1258
01:21:42,467 --> 01:21:45,197
"We can do it

1259
01:21:46,471 --> 01:21:50,100
"Mama is gonna see to it!

01:21:50,275 --> 01:21:53,108
"Curtain up, light the lights

"There's the bell, follow me

1264
01:22:04,522 --> 01:22:09,255
"And nothin's gonna stop us

01:22:11,563 --> 01:22:17,024
"Honey, everything's coming up roses
and daffodils

1266
01:22:18,403 --> 01:22:23,739
"Everything's comin' up sunshine

01:22:31,182 --> 01:22:36,017
"Everything's comin' up roses

01:22:36,588 --> 01:22:41,423
"For me and for you!"

1270
01:23:03,081 --> 01:23:04,480
No, no, no.

1271
01:23:05,917 --> 01:23:07,475
That's not right.

1272
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,020
Sing out, Louise, sing out.

1273
01:23:12,157 --> 01:23:14,455
Let Mr. Ziegfeld hear you.

1274
01:23:16,661 --> 01:23:18,925
I got it! I got it!

1275
01:23:20,532 --> 01:23:21,999
I had another dream.

1276
01:23:22,901 --> 01:23:26,462
Instead of boys we'll use girls.
And you know the cow in the act?

1277
01:23:26,704 --> 01:23:29,400
It's not gonna be a cow anymore.
It's gonna be a bull.

1278
01:23:29,474 --> 01:23:31,203
So, it's gonna be a bull.

1279
01:23:32,944 --> 01:23:34,138
It's a good idea.

1280
01:23:34,445 --> 01:23:37,505
And you're gonna be the bullfighter.
And you know what?

1281
01:23:37,682 --> 01:23:40,810
We're callin' the act
Madame Rose's Toreadorables.

1282
01:23:41,719 --> 01:23:43,152
All we need is the girls.

1283
01:23:44,322 --> 01:23:45,482
Yes, Mother.

1284
01:23:46,624 --> 01:23:48,353
All we need is the girls.

1285
01:23:49,027 --> 01:23:50,551
How're we gonna get 'em?

1286
01:23:52,363 --> 01:23:53,728
We'll get 'em...

1287
01:23:54,132 --> 01:23:55,429
...Uncle Jocko.

1288
01:24:00,939 --> 01:24:05,535
Herbie did the Uncle Jocko bit again and
got us six girls for the act, semi-talented.

1289
01:24:05,977 --> 01:24:10,607
I didn't like the dough goin' out for hotels,
so I discovered the Army and Navy stores.

1290
01:24:10,982 --> 01:24:12,779
Surplus tents, for instance.

1291
01:24:14,919 --> 01:24:16,011
Ready, Louise?

1292
01:24:16,087 --> 01:24:17,145
Yes, Mama.

1293
01:24:17,589 --> 01:24:19,989
- Ready, girls?
- Yes, Madam Rose.

1294
01:24:20,225 --> 01:24:22,659
Remember, you mustn't be discouraged
by the past.

1295
01:24:22,727 --> 01:24:24,661
You're artists of the theater.

1296
01:24:28,233 --> 01:24:30,895
Madam Rose's Toreadorables.

1297
01:24:40,044 --> 01:24:41,272
"Extra, extra!

1298
01:24:41,346 --> 01:24:44,577
"Hey, look at the headlines
Historical news is being made"

1299
01:24:44,882 --> 01:24:45,871
Sing out!

1300
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:47,178
"Extra, extra!

1301
01:24:47,252 --> 01:24:50,585
"They're drawing a red line
Around the biggest scoop of the decade

1302
01:24:50,655 --> 01:24:51,644
"In the decade

1303
01:24:51,723 --> 01:24:54,487
"A barrel of charm
A fabulous thrill

1304
01:24:54,892 --> 01:24:57,690
"The biggest little headline in vaudeville

- "That 5-foot-3 bundle of dynamite"
- Sell it! Sell it, girls!

1307
01:25:04,836 --> 01:25:06,770
"Senorita Louise"

1308
01:25:09,774 --> 01:25:12,265
Well, come on, Louise, come on!

1309
01:25:22,387 --> 01:25:25,948
Olé, everybody! My name's Louise.
What's yours?

1310
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:31,460
Well, it's comin' along.

1311
01:25:34,999 --> 01:25:35,988
Mama...

1312
01:25:37,368 --> 01:25:38,699
...l'm just no good at it.

1313
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:42,467
Now don't be silly.
All right, girls, let's try the finish.

1314
01:25:42,707 --> 01:25:45,608
They'll forgive you anything
if you've got a strong finish.

1315
01:25:45,677 --> 01:25:48,612
You're late. Now, girls,
let's make it stirring!

1316
01:25:54,052 --> 01:25:56,782
Pick up your feet, Louise! Pick 'em up!
Up, up!

1317
01:26:11,269 --> 01:26:12,861
I guess they're tired.

1318
01:26:13,538 --> 01:26:16,666
All right, girls, over to your tents.
Get ready for bed.

1319
01:26:17,542 --> 01:26:19,533
- Good night, Louise.
- Good night, Mama.

1320
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:22,875
- But it's still light, Madam Rose.
- Don't argue, go to bed.

1321
01:26:23,314 --> 01:26:25,782
And don't forget to write your mothers...

1322
01:26:25,883 --> 01:26:27,111
...for money.

1323
01:26:27,752 --> 01:26:29,242
How'd it go in town?

1324
01:26:29,654 --> 01:26:31,121
Not even a benefit.

1325
01:26:31,189 --> 01:26:33,657
They're too un-American down here,
that's what.

1326
01:26:33,725 --> 01:26:37,957
We better talk about goin' back up north
as soon as I tell the girls a bedtime story.

1327
01:26:40,064 --> 01:26:42,430
Why do you make Louise
wear that wig in the act?

1328
01:26:44,335 --> 01:26:46,269
It makes her look more like...

1329
01:26:48,606 --> 01:26:49,698
...a star.

1330
01:26:50,375 --> 01:26:51,899
Why do you keep the cow?

1331
01:26:51,976 --> 01:26:54,843
Herbie, if that cow goes, I go.

1332
01:26:55,179 --> 01:26:56,669
The act can be fixed.

1333
01:26:56,748 --> 01:26:59,376
If I was doin' it for her sister
I'd have it all set.

1334
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:00,781
But you're not.

1335
01:27:01,085 --> 01:27:02,643
And I'm not my sister.

1336
01:27:03,688 --> 01:27:05,588
She doesn't expect you to be.

1337
01:27:05,923 --> 01:27:06,890
Mama...

1338
01:27:07,492 --> 01:27:10,518
...I love you so much
and I've tried hard as I could...

1339
01:27:11,362 --> 01:27:14,092
...but the act is rotten and I'm rotten in it.

1340
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:17,396
How do you like that? Typical of a kid.

1341
01:27:17,869 --> 01:27:19,860
Mama, I've been wanting to say this...

1342
01:27:19,937 --> 01:27:21,871
- Always impatient.
- Mama...

1343
01:27:21,939 --> 01:27:24,931
- A few break-in dates don't go so good...
- I'm not a blonde.

1344
01:27:25,009 --> 01:27:28,410
And I'm not my sister,
and I just can't do what she did.

1345
01:27:28,813 --> 01:27:30,212
She's not asking you to.

1346
01:27:30,281 --> 01:27:31,976
Maybe you want show business...

1347
01:27:32,049 --> 01:27:34,142
Maybe? Why, it's our whole lives!

1348
01:27:34,218 --> 01:27:36,880
It's what we've been working for
since you were born.

1349
01:27:36,954 --> 01:27:40,754
Honey, maybe I have been
on the wrong track about your material...

1350
01:27:40,825 --> 01:27:42,725
...but I'll find out what you do best.

1351
01:27:42,794 --> 01:27:45,888
The good Lord says, "You gotta take
the rough with the smooth."

1352
01:27:45,963 --> 01:27:49,455
And you're lucky. You were born lucky,
because you're not alone, see?

1353
01:27:49,534 --> 01:27:51,126
- Right, Herbie?
- Right.

1354
01:27:52,904 --> 01:27:56,806
You know, we could get a nice refund
on this if we'd ever paid for it.

1355
01:27:57,775 --> 01:28:01,040
How about getting a gallon of peroxide
and a carton of toothbrushes?

1356
01:28:01,145 --> 01:28:02,271
What for, Herbie?

1357
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:04,077
Make 'em all blondes.

1358
01:28:05,116 --> 01:28:06,378
I was only jokin'.

1359
01:28:06,517 --> 01:28:07,848
So was I, honey.

1360
01:28:08,119 --> 01:28:09,552
But why not do it?

1361
01:28:10,455 --> 01:28:13,856
- Louise, they're just children.
- They're young girls, Mama.

1362
01:28:14,192 --> 01:28:16,353
As blondes they could be
pretty young girls.

1363
01:28:16,427 --> 01:28:18,088
With some imagination it might work.

1364
01:28:18,162 --> 01:28:20,426
It'd jazz up the act, make it easier to sell.

1365
01:28:20,498 --> 01:28:23,626
We could call it,
Madam Rose and her Blonde Babies.

1366
01:28:23,701 --> 01:28:24,759
Baby Blondes.

1367
01:28:24,836 --> 01:28:26,463
No, nothing with babies.

1368
01:28:26,537 --> 01:28:28,004
- Hollywood Blondes.
- Yes!

1369
01:28:28,072 --> 01:28:30,768
All blondes except you,
'cause you're the star.

1370
01:28:31,542 --> 01:28:32,941
If I'm the star...

1371
01:28:33,344 --> 01:28:36,370
...then it should be
Louise and Her Hollywood Blondes.

1372
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:42,048
Rose Louise and her Hollywood Blondes!

1373
01:28:44,455 --> 01:28:45,422
Okay.

1374
01:28:46,557 --> 01:28:49,492
Well, I told you everything
would come up lollipops.

1375
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:51,594
Herbie got us a two-week date.

1376
01:28:51,796 --> 01:28:54,993
And we were paid minimum plus,
guaranteed in advance...

1377
01:28:55,433 --> 01:28:57,367
...at the Wichita Opera House.

1378
01:28:57,602 --> 01:28:59,433
We were on our way up again.

1379
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:02,065
Nothin' can stop Rose. Nothin'.

1380
01:29:03,608 --> 01:29:06,042
Okay, okay. Kill the traveler.

1381
01:29:06,544 --> 01:29:08,978
That's right, trim it. Okay.

1382
01:29:09,514 --> 01:29:10,708
That's right.

1383
01:29:20,491 --> 01:29:22,982
It's a real live theater!

1384
01:29:23,361 --> 01:29:25,295
With a real live stage!

1385
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:26,995
Don't you love it?

1386
01:29:33,371 --> 01:29:35,032
Louise, look!

1387
01:29:36,007 --> 01:29:38,305
A real live theater.

1388
01:29:40,177 --> 01:29:42,702
Just like opening day rehearsals
used to be.

1389
01:29:43,347 --> 01:29:44,678
Mama's gonna love it.

1390
01:29:44,749 --> 01:29:48,185
- Will you kill them floods?
- Will you shut your face?

1391
01:29:49,186 --> 01:29:52,417
- She isn't gonna love that.
- Or that!

1392
01:29:53,224 --> 01:29:55,055
Slave, my fiddle.

1393
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:00,824
What the hay?

1394
01:30:01,599 --> 01:30:03,863
What kind of an act is that?

1395
01:30:04,135 --> 01:30:05,193
Yeah?

1396
01:30:06,237 --> 01:30:08,569
Okay, jailbait, you the Hollywood Blondes?

1397
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:10,266
- Yes. I'm...
- You're late.

1398
01:30:10,341 --> 01:30:12,707
- Our car broke down and...
- Skip it.

1399
01:30:12,977 --> 01:30:16,276
Some of you can use that dressing room.
The rest of you, over there.

1400
01:30:16,347 --> 01:30:19,214
The first one you share with Tessie Tura,
the Texas Twirler.

1401
01:30:19,984 --> 01:30:22,111
The second with Mazeppa,
Revolutions in Dance.

1402
01:30:22,186 --> 01:30:23,585
Now shake it up, will you?

1403
01:30:24,689 --> 01:30:25,678
So...

1404
01:30:26,724 --> 01:30:30,023
...you're the act that's supposed
to keep the cops out, huh?

1405
01:30:30,494 --> 01:30:32,257
Boy, you must be lousy.

1406
01:30:34,498 --> 01:30:36,398
It's a real live theater, all right.

1407
01:30:36,467 --> 01:30:38,799
He reminds me of my brother.

1408
01:30:40,204 --> 01:30:41,501
Don't start sniveling.

1409
01:30:41,572 --> 01:30:45,064
Take the cow and anything else
you can carry into the first dressing room.

1410
01:30:45,142 --> 01:30:48,942
Marjorie May, take the other girls
into that second room and start unpacking.

1411
01:30:49,013 --> 01:30:50,605
I want to go home.

1412
01:31:00,758 --> 01:31:02,555
Look at this!

1413
01:31:03,294 --> 01:31:07,663
That Tessie Tura must be a very fancy lady.

1414
01:31:12,336 --> 01:31:14,031
She must also be a pig.

1415
01:31:16,941 --> 01:31:17,930
Louise!

1416
01:31:19,644 --> 01:31:20,906
In here, Mama.

1417
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:23,642
Let me help you.

1418
01:31:23,714 --> 01:31:25,739
Baby, we're back in the theater.

1419
01:31:26,083 --> 01:31:28,176
We're back in a real live theater.

1420
01:31:28,252 --> 01:31:31,221
I really think we ought to talk to Herbie.

1421
01:31:31,288 --> 01:31:35,281
He went up front to check on our billing.
Good morning. Good morning, I...

1422
01:31:46,604 --> 01:31:48,037
It ain't weighted right.

1423
01:31:54,645 --> 01:31:58,103
It scratches the devil out of me
and it just don't bump when I do.

1424
01:31:58,182 --> 01:32:00,878
Maybe there's somethin' wrong
with your bumper.

1425
01:32:02,186 --> 01:32:03,448
Big joke!

1426
01:32:04,188 --> 01:32:08,147
I'm out there bumpin' my brains off
with no action and she's bein' witty.

1427
01:32:11,195 --> 01:32:12,662
Hey, you with the neck.

1428
01:32:13,364 --> 01:32:17,198
I paid six bucks for that costume.
Now back where you found it.

1429
01:32:17,268 --> 01:32:18,394
Yes, ma'am.

1430
01:32:42,059 --> 01:32:44,220
Get the bags, get the cow, get the props!

1431
01:32:44,295 --> 01:32:47,059
You don't know
what kind of theater this is.

1432
01:32:47,364 --> 01:32:49,525
Yes, I do. It's a house of burlesque.

1433
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,831
A house of burlesque.
And you know what that is? Filth!

1434
01:32:52,903 --> 01:32:56,270
- When your friend Herbie shows his face...
- I'm sure he didn't know.

1435
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:57,864
Not much, he didn't. Agnes!

1436
01:32:57,942 --> 01:32:59,910
He got the booking over the telephone.

1437
01:33:00,344 --> 01:33:01,675
We were all so happy.

1438
01:33:02,747 --> 01:33:04,078
My name is Amanda.

1439
01:33:04,148 --> 01:33:08,107
Your name is Agnes and I want you
and the others out of here in two seconds.

1440
01:33:08,185 --> 01:33:10,483
- But, Madam Rose...
- March! March! Go!

1441
01:33:10,588 --> 01:33:13,216
Wait a minute.
Wait in the other dressing room.

1442
01:33:14,625 --> 01:33:17,093
You take the rear end of the cow,
I'll take the front.

1443
01:33:17,161 --> 01:33:21,495
And what bags we can't carry, your friend
Herbie can pick up and carry himself.

1444
01:33:22,833 --> 01:33:25,859
Listen to me. Just because you think
Herbie can do no wrong...

1445
01:33:25,936 --> 01:33:29,167
- This has nothing to do with him.
- You don't know what burlesque is.

1446
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:30,764
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't!

1447
01:33:30,841 --> 01:33:33,173
No daughter of mine will work
in a burlesque house.

1448
01:33:33,244 --> 01:33:35,212
And no daughter of any woman I know.

1449
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:36,803
Where are we gonna work?

1450
01:33:36,881 --> 01:33:40,544
Vaudevillians won't even live
in the same hotel as burlesque people.

1451
01:33:42,853 --> 01:33:44,878
Mama, how much money do we have?

1452
01:33:46,157 --> 01:33:49,615
Including what's left of their allowances,
how much money do we have?

1453
01:33:52,062 --> 01:33:53,427
Somethin' will turn up.

1454
01:33:53,664 --> 01:33:56,030
It has turned up and this is it!

1455
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:59,497
Mama, we're flat broke.
We've gotta take this job.

1456
01:34:00,371 --> 01:34:03,340
Even if you wanted to quit and go home,
we'd have to take it.

1457
01:34:07,077 --> 01:34:08,339
I had a dream.

1458
01:34:13,017 --> 01:34:15,451
- Mama...
- You're gonna like this one.

1459
01:34:15,953 --> 01:34:19,150
I had it over a week ago,
only I didn't want to tell you.

1460
01:34:19,356 --> 01:34:21,085
The cow came into my room.

1461
01:34:22,493 --> 01:34:25,223
But she wasn't dancin', smilin' this time.

1462
01:34:26,797 --> 01:34:28,992
She was wheezin' and kind of sad-like.

1463
01:34:30,034 --> 01:34:33,333
She came over to my bed
and looked at me, and she said:

1464
01:34:34,138 --> 01:34:36,629
"Rose, move over."

1465
01:34:39,076 --> 01:34:40,441
I'm sorry, Mama.

1466
01:34:41,512 --> 01:34:44,310
Why? She didn't ask you to move over.

1467
01:34:45,583 --> 01:34:48,313
I mean, I'm sorry I'm not good enough
in the act.

1468
01:34:50,187 --> 01:34:52,781
It's the act that isn't good enough, baby...

1469
01:34:54,758 --> 01:34:55,952
...or somethin'.

1470
01:34:57,027 --> 01:34:58,085
Rose!

1471
01:35:00,497 --> 01:35:01,464
In here.

1472
01:35:01,532 --> 01:35:04,865
Look, I didn't know. Louise.
Rose, I didn't know, believe me.

1473
01:35:04,935 --> 01:35:06,095
I do, honey.

1474
01:35:06,737 --> 01:35:09,365
Oh, what's the difference?
The money is good.

1475
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:13,308
It's only two weeks and maybe
by that time somethin' will turn up. Right?

1476
01:35:14,111 --> 01:35:15,100
Right!

1477
01:35:15,846 --> 01:35:17,814
You're a nice girl, Rose. Thank you.

1478
01:35:18,782 --> 01:35:22,309
- That's show business.
- One good thing: I bet we get top billing.

1479
01:35:23,888 --> 01:35:26,982
Actually, you see,
they had us kinda lost in the middle.

1480
01:35:27,124 --> 01:35:29,490
I thought last would be better,
so that it reads:

1481
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:31,824
"And Rose Louise
and Her Hollywood Blondes."

1482
01:35:31,896 --> 01:35:34,694
They'll use plenty of pictures
and put a box around it.

1483
01:35:34,765 --> 01:35:37,233
Forget the box, Herbie, and the pictures.

1484
01:35:37,368 --> 01:35:40,360
You don't know what they say
in the business, but Herbie does.

1485
01:35:40,437 --> 01:35:43,895
When a vaudeville act plays burlesque
it means it's all washed up.

1486
01:35:44,341 --> 01:35:47,640
Herbie, nothin' is gonna
turn up for us, is it?

1487
01:35:50,047 --> 01:35:51,036
No.

1488
01:35:54,919 --> 01:35:56,614
It is a pretty rotten act.

1489
01:35:57,821 --> 01:35:59,413
Honey, it's not the act.

1490
01:35:59,490 --> 01:36:03,051
It's like I been tellin' you,
vaudeville is dead, stone-cold dead!

1491
01:36:03,928 --> 01:36:06,294
- We sure tried though, didn't we?
- We sure did.

1492
01:36:06,864 --> 01:36:07,796
Right?

1493
01:36:07,932 --> 01:36:08,921
Right.

1494
01:36:10,234 --> 01:36:11,223
Herbie.

1495
01:36:13,504 --> 01:36:15,267
I better get the cues ready.

1496
01:36:15,339 --> 01:36:19,799
Hey, Rose Louise, where's your music?
And your light cues?

1497
01:36:19,877 --> 01:36:21,504
I'll be right with you.

1498
01:36:22,846 --> 01:36:25,110
- You Rose Louise?
- Yeah, I'm Rose Louise.

1499
01:36:25,215 --> 01:36:26,341
Oh, Herbie.

1500
01:36:27,017 --> 01:36:28,609
Things are lookin' up.

1501
01:36:28,986 --> 01:36:32,353
I got a show to open, Rose Louise,
so move your butt.

1502
01:36:36,327 --> 01:36:38,158
Now listen, you little punk!

1503
01:36:39,596 --> 01:36:43,327
For the next two weeks you're gonna speak
like a Sunday school teacher.

1504
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:47,336
You got something in this theater
you probably never saw before: A lady.

1505
01:36:47,538 --> 01:36:48,596
Take a look.

1506
01:36:49,473 --> 01:36:50,735
That is a lady.

1507
01:36:51,275 --> 01:36:52,936
And that is also a lady.

1508
01:36:54,178 --> 01:36:58,512
And every girl in this act is a lady and
don't you forget it. Do you understand?

1509
01:36:58,782 --> 01:36:59,840
Yes, sir.

1510
01:37:03,654 --> 01:37:07,590
Now get out there on that stage
and I'll give you the cues when I'm ready.

1511
01:37:07,658 --> 01:37:08,647
Yes, sir.

1512
01:37:12,696 --> 01:37:13,856
Excuse me...

1513
01:37:14,598 --> 01:37:15,622
...ma'am.

1514
01:37:29,046 --> 01:37:33,107
Sir, won't you give me your protection?
I'm a lady, too.

1515
01:37:33,584 --> 01:37:36,712
Just let me by, lady,
and there won't be any casualties.

1516
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:38,185
Say, you're cute.

1517
01:37:38,355 --> 01:37:41,290
How about you and me
goin' for a ride after the show?

1518
01:37:41,425 --> 01:37:42,983
All my seats are reserved.

1519
01:37:45,129 --> 01:37:47,620
The thing worked, thanks to you.

1520
01:37:53,170 --> 01:37:56,662
- Well, if you ladies will excuse me.
- We're very busy.

1521
01:37:57,241 --> 01:37:59,607
- In my dressing room?
- In your dress...

1522
01:37:59,843 --> 01:38:01,504
You heard me.

1523
01:38:02,212 --> 01:38:05,010
And I don't like sharin' it
any more than you do.

1524
01:38:05,249 --> 01:38:08,275
Particularly with a troupe
from the Virgin Islands.

1525
01:38:08,685 --> 01:38:13,213
Now don't start up on us, understand?
We're headliners from the Orpheum Circuit.

1526
01:38:13,457 --> 01:38:15,687
We were booked into this theater
by mistake.

1527
01:38:15,759 --> 01:38:17,056
Weren't we all?

1528
01:38:18,629 --> 01:38:21,029
Say, who made that?

1529
01:38:22,066 --> 01:38:24,500
I did. I make all our costumes.

1530
01:38:25,202 --> 01:38:28,569
My, look at them ladylike little stitches.

1531
01:38:29,506 --> 01:38:33,340
That miserable broad who's been makin'
my gowns must be usin' a fish hook.

1532
01:38:34,178 --> 01:38:35,509
What do you pay her?

1533
01:38:36,513 --> 01:38:39,107
- $25 a gown and I provide the material.
- $30.

1534
01:38:39,183 --> 01:38:40,878
- She's new in the business.
- $30.

1535
01:38:40,951 --> 01:38:42,475
- Are you her mother?
- Yes.

1536
01:38:42,553 --> 01:38:43,542
$30.

1537
01:38:45,856 --> 01:38:48,256
I'll get the material after the matinee.

1538
01:38:48,525 --> 01:38:51,392
It's a deal. Louise,
where's your toreador costume?

1539
01:38:51,662 --> 01:38:54,790
The girls must have it
in the other dressing room with them.

1540
01:38:55,299 --> 01:38:58,166
Heaven knows what else they've got
in their dressing room.

1541
01:39:00,070 --> 01:39:01,765
From the way that dame walks...

1542
01:39:01,839 --> 01:39:04,637
...she would've made a real good stripper
in her day.

1543
01:39:09,046 --> 01:39:10,138
Tessie...

1544
01:39:10,581 --> 01:39:12,708
Tessie, I'm short a talking woman.

1545
01:39:13,217 --> 01:39:15,583
Tough. "T, U, F." Tough.

1546
01:39:16,453 --> 01:39:18,751
The new comic won't use a chorus girl.

1547
01:39:19,156 --> 01:39:22,353
Then let him use Mazeppa.
Everybody else has.

1548
01:39:26,797 --> 01:39:30,528
Now you know Mazeppa's got
her Gladiator Ballet just before his spot.

1549
01:39:30,667 --> 01:39:32,931
Let them cut the ballet. It stinks anyway.

1550
01:39:33,170 --> 01:39:34,967
Be a sport. I'm in a bind.

1551
01:39:35,606 --> 01:39:38,404
You're always in a bind
in this flea-bitten trap.

1552
01:39:39,042 --> 01:39:42,910
I'm a strip woman, slob.
I don't do no scenes. Now blow.

1553
01:39:45,516 --> 01:39:49,043
Have you ever heard of
a first-class strip woman playin' scenes?

1554
01:39:49,353 --> 01:39:53,346
When you play stock in a dump like this,
I guess you gotta expect to get insulted.

1555
01:39:53,423 --> 01:39:54,981
The work is steady, isn't it?

1556
01:39:55,058 --> 01:39:57,583
But you bring a new star in
for each show, don't ya?

1557
01:39:57,661 --> 01:39:59,595
Tessie, it's just a few lines.

1558
01:40:00,297 --> 01:40:02,731
Fat boy, save your bad breath.

1559
01:40:02,799 --> 01:40:05,233
- I'll give you $10 extra.
- No.

1560
01:40:05,402 --> 01:40:06,733
I can read lines.

1561
01:40:06,803 --> 01:40:07,735
Who are you?

1562
01:40:07,804 --> 01:40:10,830
Rose Louise, of Rose Louise
and Her Hollywood Blondes.

1563
01:40:11,041 --> 01:40:13,202
Just a minute. What kind of lines?

1564
01:40:13,277 --> 01:40:14,801
- You in her act?
- Not exactly.

1565
01:40:14,878 --> 01:40:18,439
- Shut up! How are your legs?
- Great! And I'll learn her the scenes.

1566
01:40:18,515 --> 01:40:19,880
Okay, $10.

1567
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:21,715
It's money, Mama.

1568
01:40:23,053 --> 01:40:25,521
What kind of lines will she read
out on that stage?

1569
01:40:25,589 --> 01:40:29,047
The same burlesque junk that's been said
since the year 1.

1570
01:40:29,793 --> 01:40:33,422
- Say, where've you been all your life?
- Playin' vaudeville.

1571
01:40:33,497 --> 01:40:35,328
Where? In the Louvre?

1572
01:40:36,433 --> 01:40:39,698
You name any town in the United States
and we've played it.

1573
01:40:40,237 --> 01:40:43,297
My grandpa says we've covered
the country like gypsies.

1574
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:46,609
Well, you may be a gypsy, Rose Louise,
but you're...

1575
01:40:46,677 --> 01:40:49,942
Say, that ain't a bad name if you ever
take up strippin'.

1576
01:40:51,381 --> 01:40:52,507
She won't.

1577
01:40:52,749 --> 01:40:55,274
No, but you'll let her feed lines
to a bum comic...

1578
01:40:55,352 --> 01:40:57,217
...for a lousy $10 a week.

1579
01:40:57,621 --> 01:41:01,216
That's trainin'. She's gonna be a headliner.
This is only temporary.

1580
01:41:01,291 --> 01:41:04,954
Just as soon as we finish here
she's goin' right back to vaudeville.

1581
01:41:05,162 --> 01:41:06,993
I better talk to Herbie about this.

1582
01:41:07,064 --> 01:41:10,727
We never do anything without consulting
our artists' representative.

1583
01:41:11,101 --> 01:41:13,899
I'd like to consult
your artists' representative.

1584
01:41:14,771 --> 01:41:15,999
That's a man.

1585
01:41:16,673 --> 01:41:18,470
He and Mama are gonna be married.

1586
01:41:18,542 --> 01:41:21,306
She better grab him
or she's dumber than she looks.

1587
01:41:21,378 --> 01:41:25,474
Don't you start calling my mother dumb.
She's a lot smarter than any of you.

1588
01:41:27,217 --> 01:41:29,651
Listen, we gotta share a dressing room.

1589
01:41:30,087 --> 01:41:32,078
Let's smoke a peace pipe, okay?

1590
01:41:33,757 --> 01:41:34,883
I'm willing.

1591
01:41:35,192 --> 01:41:36,386
I hope so.

1592
01:41:36,493 --> 01:41:40,259
Sharin' a dressing room is like sleepin'
together, and if you don't get along...

1593
01:41:42,432 --> 01:41:47,165
I'll thank you not to give the boss
any notion that I would ever play scenes.

1594
01:41:47,604 --> 01:41:52,405
And one more disparaging remark
about my ballet...

1595
01:41:53,176 --> 01:41:56,839
...will find this bugle right in your eye.

1596
01:41:56,913 --> 01:41:57,902
Please!

1597
01:42:00,183 --> 01:42:01,878
There's a lady present.

1598
01:42:02,286 --> 01:42:03,253
Where?

1599
01:42:03,654 --> 01:42:05,884
Open your eyes instead of your mouth.

1600
01:42:06,757 --> 01:42:09,954
Gypsy, meet Miss Mazeppa, Miss Electra.

1601
01:42:11,962 --> 01:42:15,762
Say, you're even younger than I was
when I started strippin'.

1602
01:42:16,533 --> 01:42:17,864
I'm not gonna strip.

1603
01:42:19,736 --> 01:42:22,034
Somethin' wrong with strippin'?

1604
01:42:22,773 --> 01:42:25,469
No, I just meant I don't have any talent.

1605
01:42:25,976 --> 01:42:27,466
You think they have?

1606
01:42:29,546 --> 01:42:31,810
I, myself, of course, was a ballerina.

1607
01:42:32,282 --> 01:42:37,117
But take it from me, to be a stripper
all you need to have is no talent.

1608
01:42:37,587 --> 01:42:39,316
You'll pardon me...

1609
01:42:40,624 --> 01:42:42,956
...but to have no talent is not enough.

1610
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:47,726
What you need to have is an idea
that makes your strip special.

1611
01:42:56,373 --> 01:42:59,001
"You can pull all the stops out

1612
01:42:59,109 --> 01:43:00,974

01:47:51,234 --> 01:47:52,360
Yeah, I do.

1679
01:47:54,671 --> 01:47:56,036
Let's do it today.

1680
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:59,565
Not while we're still in burlesque.

1681
01:47:59,643 --> 01:48:01,941
- The day we close.
- It's a deal.

1682
01:48:02,846 --> 01:48:04,074
Oh, Herbie.

1683
01:48:05,515 --> 01:48:06,948
I do, I do!

1684
01:48:07,117 --> 01:48:08,607
So do I, Rose.

1685
01:48:34,911 --> 01:48:36,037
Come in.

1686
01:48:39,082 --> 01:48:41,243
I'll bet you thought I forgot, huh?

1687
01:48:42,786 --> 01:48:44,048
Not Herbie!

1688
01:48:44,521 --> 01:48:49,083
I remember everything, including
the wedding bouquet, the finest in Wichita.

1689
01:48:50,126 --> 01:48:51,423
Thanks, Herbie.

1690
01:48:52,162 --> 01:48:54,357
They're knockouts, aren't they?

1691
01:48:54,931 --> 01:48:56,956
They sure are knockouts, Herbie.

1692
01:48:59,135 --> 01:49:01,831
Hey, stop packing and talk to me!

1693
01:49:03,973 --> 01:49:06,840
Gosh, this is the great day!

1694
01:49:08,645 --> 01:49:11,045
I can't help it. I'm nervous.
Why aren't you?

1695
01:49:11,114 --> 01:49:14,049
- I've never been so nervous.
- You've never been married before.

1696
01:49:14,117 --> 01:49:17,553
You've never been married before
like you'll be married this time.

1697
01:49:17,620 --> 01:49:20,555
She's a little sad, too.
You know, about the girls.

1698
01:49:21,324 --> 01:49:23,519
Rose, honey, I know what you're feelin'.

1699
01:49:23,593 --> 01:49:27,689
It ain't easy to give this up after
all these years, but you'll never regret it.

1700
01:49:27,764 --> 01:49:29,561
I ought to shut up, but I can't help it.

1701
01:49:29,632 --> 01:49:31,862
I'm finally getting everything
I ever wanted.

1702
01:49:31,935 --> 01:49:34,301
Including a fancy ceremony
and bridesmaids.

1703
01:49:35,371 --> 01:49:38,898
What the minister will say when he sees
all that Hollywood blonde hair...

1704
01:49:38,975 --> 01:49:41,068
...I don't know. I don't know.

1705
01:49:41,377 --> 01:49:44,608
Let's hope he's colorblind.
What difference does it make?

1706
01:49:45,014 --> 01:49:47,482
All he has to ask in exactly one hour is:

1707
01:49:47,917 --> 01:49:50,044
"Do you, Rose, take him, Herbie?"

1708
01:49:51,254 --> 01:49:55,054
And you know what I'm gonna answer?
"I, Rose, take you, Herbie."

1709
01:49:55,925 --> 01:49:57,051
Thank you.

1710
01:50:01,164 --> 01:50:04,964
- I better get the bags in the car.
- I don't know why I stay in this business!

1711
01:50:05,034 --> 01:50:08,333
- If it ain't one headache, it's another!
- They'll hear you out front.

1712
01:50:08,404 --> 01:50:11,498
It's my theater, ain't it?
Last week, no talkin' woman.

1713
01:50:11,574 --> 01:50:13,337
The week before, no second banana.

1714
01:50:13,409 --> 01:50:16,936
If you knew that crazy broad wasn't here
why'd you start the performance?

1715
01:50:17,013 --> 01:50:18,674
She don't go on till next to closin'.

1716
01:50:18,748 --> 01:50:21,239
She said she was only goin'
to the drugstore.

1717
01:50:21,317 --> 01:50:23,683
- What'd they arrest her for?
- Shoplifting.

1718
01:50:23,753 --> 01:50:24,742
Cut the spot.

1719
01:50:24,821 --> 01:50:27,790
Rose, can we invite the minister
for a drink afterwards?

1720
01:50:27,857 --> 01:50:29,552
It's the star strip!

1721
01:50:29,726 --> 01:50:30,784
Cut it!

1722
01:50:33,196 --> 01:50:36,461
Mama, we could hang the cow's head
over the mantelpiece.

1723
01:50:36,566 --> 01:50:40,332
They'll yell "murder" if it's the same bags
they've seen the last eight weeks.

1724
01:50:40,403 --> 01:50:43,839
- The star's the novelty.
- Pastey, what do you expect me to do?

1725
01:50:43,907 --> 01:50:45,568
- Let you strip?
- No.

1726
01:50:47,744 --> 01:50:49,473
- My daughter can do it.
- What?

1727
01:50:49,546 --> 01:50:51,480
- Rose Louise.
- Since when?

1728
01:50:51,548 --> 01:50:53,482
Since she's seen how easy it is.

1729
01:50:53,550 --> 01:50:56,951
- She didn't look bad in the scenes.
- She'll look great when I fix her up!

1730
01:50:57,020 --> 01:51:00,387
- What's the gimmick?
- She's young and you got any better ideas?

1731
01:51:01,057 --> 01:51:02,524
She'd better get ready now.

1732
01:51:02,592 --> 01:51:03,957
It's the star spot.

1733
01:51:04,027 --> 01:51:05,790
- That means star salary.
- If we keep her.

1734
01:51:05,862 --> 01:51:08,023
You will. She's gonna be wonderful.

1735
01:51:08,097 --> 01:51:09,724
I knew somethin' would turn up.

1736
01:51:09,799 --> 01:51:11,892
Where's the dress you were making
for Tessie?

1737
01:51:11,968 --> 01:51:14,766
It'll work perfect for you.
Get into your makeup.

1738
01:51:14,838 --> 01:51:16,430
There isn't much time.

1739
01:51:20,476 --> 01:51:23,070
Silly, you aren't really gonna strip.

1740
01:51:23,580 --> 01:51:27,038
All you're gonna do is walk
around the stage in time to the music...

1741
01:51:27,116 --> 01:51:30,643
...and drop a shoulder strap at the end.
You're a lady, like Herbie says.

1742
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:34,918
You'll parade so grand they'll think
it's a favor if you even show 'em your knee.

1743
01:51:34,991 --> 01:51:37,289
Louise, it's the star spot.

1744
01:51:37,427 --> 01:51:39,691
I always promised my daughter
we'd be a star.

1745
01:51:39,762 --> 01:51:41,024
Not like this.

1746
01:51:41,631 --> 01:51:43,189
You can't do it, Rose.

1747
01:51:43,266 --> 01:51:46,326
Herbie, it's all right to walk out
when they want ya...

1748
01:51:46,436 --> 01:51:49,872
...but we can't walk out when
after all these years we're still a flop.

1749
01:51:49,939 --> 01:51:53,033
That's quittin'.
We can't quit because we're still a flop.

1750
01:51:53,109 --> 01:51:56,101
Please, do this. Then we can leave proud
because we made it.

1751
01:51:56,179 --> 01:51:57,203
Maybe only in burlesque.

1752
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,908
Maybe only in second-rate burlesque
at that, but...

1753
01:52:01,851 --> 01:52:03,580
Let's walk away a star.

1754
01:52:19,669 --> 01:52:20,658
Baby.

1755
01:52:24,607 --> 01:52:26,507
No time to finish that dress.

1756
01:52:26,776 --> 01:52:28,471
I'll get everything ready.

1757
01:52:28,578 --> 01:52:31,342
Get the junk off this dress, the Tessie trim.

1758
01:52:33,082 --> 01:52:35,243
Herbie, see what the house is like.

1759
01:52:35,852 --> 01:52:36,841
Sure.

1760
01:52:36,986 --> 01:52:38,351
Sure, why not?

1761
01:52:40,356 --> 01:52:43,382
Didn't I always tell you,
you were born lucky, Louise?

1762
01:52:44,227 --> 01:52:47,253
Not too much makeup, baby.
Young and girlish, pure.

1763
01:52:47,330 --> 01:52:50,128
Don't smear that junk on your face
the way the others do!

1764
01:52:50,199 --> 01:52:52,759
Just leave your mouth
the way the good Lord made it.

1765
01:52:52,835 --> 01:52:54,769
Not too much rouge. No beauty marks.

1766
01:52:54,837 --> 01:52:58,773
You'll be a lady: Grand, elegant,
with a classy ladylike walk.

1767
01:52:59,175 --> 01:53:02,303
Ye gods, shoes!
We can use the black ones.

1768
01:53:02,378 --> 01:53:04,505
The old ones that we borrowed
from Tessie.

1769
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:07,549
They'll have to do.
If they're too big, stuff 'em with paper.

1770
01:53:07,617 --> 01:53:11,383
Your hair's all wrong. You can't just let it
hang there like spaghetti.

1771
01:53:11,454 --> 01:53:14,685
Get it up, dear! And puff it out on top.
It's gotta be classy.

1772
01:53:14,924 --> 01:53:18,451
Thank God the Lord gave us good color
and that you washed it this morning.

1773
01:53:18,528 --> 01:53:20,826
Do you think we should use
a few feathers in it?

1774
01:53:20,897 --> 01:53:22,990
No, that's what they all do. Jewelry!

1775
01:53:23,066 --> 01:53:26,900
No, let Tessie and the others wear
all this vulgar junk. Come in.

1776
01:53:27,170 --> 01:53:28,660
- She ready?
- She'll be there.

1777
01:53:28,738 --> 01:53:29,966
She's on in seven minutes.

1778
01:53:30,039 --> 01:53:32,872
She'll be there. Come on, Louise.
Get in the dress.

1779
01:53:32,942 --> 01:53:34,534
Come dear, come.

1780
01:53:35,712 --> 01:53:37,942
You're gonna be just wonderful, darling.

1781
01:53:38,047 --> 01:53:40,481
Go along, dear. Here's your dress.

1782
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:43,781
Keep a lot of pins in your hair.
Get it tight so it won't fall down.

1783
01:53:43,853 --> 01:53:46,651
- Will you get out of here!
- Six and a half minutes.

1784
01:53:46,723 --> 01:53:48,088
I know, I know.

1785
01:53:49,425 --> 01:53:51,393
Say, whose are these?

1786
01:53:51,761 --> 01:53:53,820
My wedding present from Tessie.

1787
01:53:53,896 --> 01:53:57,696
Good for a lady. She can wear 'em.
Now what else? Music. Music.

1788
01:54:00,870 --> 01:54:03,464
Spanish. Military. Cow.

1789
01:54:07,110 --> 01:54:09,544
Maybe she can do
the Let Me Entertain You number.

1790
01:54:09,612 --> 01:54:12,445
Baby, you can do
the Let me Entertain You number.

1791
01:54:12,515 --> 01:54:15,416
I'll mark it for the conductor
to repeat two choruses slow.

1792
01:54:15,485 --> 01:54:17,817
No, two and a half. And sing out, Louise!

1793
01:54:18,054 --> 01:54:19,453
Just walk and dip.

1794
01:54:19,789 --> 01:54:21,484
Remember, you're a lady.

1795
01:54:21,657 --> 01:54:24,251
Make 'em beg for more
and then don't give it to 'em.

1796
01:54:24,327 --> 01:54:25,658
Did I forget anything?

1797
01:54:26,462 --> 01:54:28,794
Is that you, honey? How is the audience?

1798
01:54:28,865 --> 01:54:30,230
It don't matter.

1799
01:54:30,533 --> 01:54:33,058
The car is outside and the girls are in it.

1800
01:54:33,669 --> 01:54:37,105
I'm just gonna put these bags in the car
and then we're going.

1801
01:54:37,373 --> 01:54:39,898
You, Louise and me,
we're gonna get married.

1802
01:54:40,576 --> 01:54:43,739
- This is our farewell to show business.
- Herbie, don't talk dumb.

1803
01:54:43,946 --> 01:54:48,349
Two performances, a lot of dollars, and
she'll always remember she was a star.

1804
01:54:48,418 --> 01:54:52,548
You want your daughter to take off her
clothes in front of a lot of hooting savages?

1805
01:54:52,622 --> 01:54:55,113
You really want her
to be ogled and leered at?

1806
01:54:55,191 --> 01:54:57,659
When a star's onstage
there's an invisible wall...

1807
01:54:57,727 --> 01:55:00,161
...between her and the audience.
She's an artist.

1808
01:55:00,229 --> 01:55:03,221
An artist can keep her audience away
and leave them smiling.

1809
01:55:03,299 --> 01:55:06,029
Listen, I'm getting sick
to my stomach again.

1810
01:55:06,102 --> 01:55:08,536
Herbie, don't you see
that I have to do this?

1811
01:55:08,604 --> 01:55:11,072
No, I don't see that you have to do this!

1812
01:55:12,075 --> 01:55:14,066
All I see is what I have to do.

1813
01:55:14,777 --> 01:55:16,745
- I'm leaving.
- I apologize.

1814
01:55:16,813 --> 01:55:17,939
No, let me!

1815
01:55:18,481 --> 01:55:20,949
For my resemblance to a mouse.
No, a worm!

1816
01:55:21,584 --> 01:55:24,712
The way I've crawled after you.
No more, Rose. No more, I won't!

1817
01:55:24,787 --> 01:55:27,950
I wanted to crawl away from you
because my stomach turned over...

1818
01:55:28,024 --> 01:55:30,618
...to think of coming back
to tell you we're finished!

1819
01:55:30,693 --> 01:55:32,888
- Tell me after we're married.
- We'll never be.

1820
01:55:32,962 --> 01:55:35,829
- We certainly are.
- No, no! No, never!

1821
01:55:36,365 --> 01:55:39,198
Not even if you got down on your knees
and begged.

1822
01:55:40,903 --> 01:55:43,565
Now look, I still love you, Rose.

1823
01:55:44,474 --> 01:55:47,568
But all the vows from here to doomsday
couldn't make you a wife.

1824
01:55:47,643 --> 01:55:49,634
I want a wife, Rose!

1825
01:55:51,114 --> 01:55:52,911
I'm gonna be a man if it kills me.

1826
01:55:52,982 --> 01:55:55,109
- So you're killin' me.
- Nobody can kill you.

1827
01:55:55,184 --> 01:55:58,847
You think I got a bulletproof vest?
You're jealous, that's what you are.

1828
01:55:58,921 --> 01:56:01,014
Of my girls, 'cause they're always first.

1829
01:56:01,090 --> 01:56:04,321
They always did and they always will.
And Louise is gonna be a star!

1830
01:56:04,393 --> 01:56:08,523
She's gonna be a star if it kills you and her.
She's gonna be a star someplace!

1831
01:56:08,598 --> 01:56:11,294
While she's gonna be a star,
where are you gonna be?

1832
01:56:11,367 --> 01:56:13,562
Where will you be
when she gets married?

1833
01:56:16,506 --> 01:56:19,031
She won't get married for years.
She's just a baby.

1834
01:56:19,108 --> 01:56:19,904
Sure.

1835
01:56:19,976 --> 01:56:23,503
- Anyway, her career'll always come first.
- That's right.

1836
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:25,342
That is right.

1837
01:56:25,581 --> 01:56:26,673
Herbie...

1838
01:56:28,684 --> 01:56:30,515
Why does everybody walk out?

1839
01:56:34,624 --> 01:56:36,091
Maybe Louise won't.

1840
01:56:37,059 --> 01:56:38,549
Don't leave, Herbie.

1841
01:56:39,729 --> 01:56:40,855
I need you.

1842
01:56:41,297 --> 01:56:42,355
What for?

1843
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:45,665
A million things.

1844
01:56:49,772 --> 01:56:51,501
Just one would be better.

1845
01:56:54,877 --> 01:56:56,139
Goodbye, honey.

1846
01:57:05,388 --> 01:57:06,685
Be a good girl.

1847
01:57:10,159 --> 01:57:12,093
You go to the devil!

1848
01:57:14,764 --> 01:57:16,527
Get her music to the conductor...

1849
01:57:16,599 --> 01:57:19,033
...and you better stand by me
for the light cues.

1850
01:57:19,101 --> 01:57:21,467
I just hope you know what you're doin'.

1851
01:57:33,916 --> 01:57:35,110
"Lucky

1852
01:57:36,485 --> 01:57:39,420
"You're a man who likes children

1853
01:57:41,724 --> 01:57:44,659
"That's an important sign

1854
01:57:47,630 --> 01:57:48,597
"Lucky

1855
01:57:50,466 --> 01:57:53,094
"I'm a woman with children

1856
01:58:02,845 --> 01:58:03,834
"Funny

1857
01:58:10,319 --> 01:58:15,313
"Small and funny"

1858
01:58:44,553 --> 01:58:46,646
I'll get the music to the leader.

1859
01:58:48,791 --> 01:58:49,917
Remember...

1860
01:58:50,726 --> 01:58:52,091
...you're a lady.

1861
01:58:52,762 --> 01:58:55,424
And you are going to be a star!

1862
01:59:17,820 --> 01:59:18,809
Mama...

1863
01:59:22,058 --> 01:59:23,218
...l'm pretty.

1864
01:59:25,328 --> 01:59:27,023
I'm a pretty girl, Mama.

1865
01:59:46,782 --> 01:59:48,147
Come on, come on.

1866
01:59:55,758 --> 01:59:57,225
You look beautiful.

1867
01:59:58,327 --> 02:00:01,194
- Just for luck, honey.
- Are you nervous, baby?

1868
02:00:01,263 --> 02:00:03,322
- What?
- I said, "Are you nervous?"

1869
02:00:04,700 --> 02:00:05,894
No, Mother.

1870
02:00:08,704 --> 02:00:12,003
Wichita's one and only
burlesque theater presents:

1871
02:00:12,141 --> 02:00:12,800
Mama!

1872
02:00:12,875 --> 02:00:14,775
Gypsy Rose Lee!

1873
02:00:15,478 --> 02:00:16,843
Her name's Louise.

1874
02:00:17,046 --> 02:00:19,037
It ain't anymore. Go on, kid.

1875
02:00:43,172 --> 02:00:46,733
"Let me entertain you

1876
02:00:49,345 --> 02:00:52,212
"Let me make you smile"

1877
02:00:52,581 --> 02:00:53,912
Sing out, Louise!

1878
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:55,005
Sing out!

1879
02:00:55,084 --> 02:00:57,575
"Let me do a few tricks

1880
02:00:57,920 --> 02:01:00,616
"Some old and then some new tricks

1881
02:01:00,990 --> 02:01:05,927
"I'm very versatile

1882
02:01:08,097 --> 02:01:10,759
"And if you're real good

1883
02:01:11,167 --> 02:01:13,829
"I'll make you feel good

1884
02:01:14,236 --> 02:01:18,866
"I want your spirits to climb

1885
02:01:19,308 --> 02:01:24,302
"So let me entertain you

1886
02:01:25,948 --> 02:01:30,942
"And we'll have a real good time
Yes, sir!

1887
02:01:32,655 --> 02:01:39,618
"We'll have a real good time"

1888
02:01:57,146 --> 02:01:59,410
Don't just walk, do something!

1889
02:02:00,082 --> 02:02:02,175
Dip! Just dip!

1890
02:02:08,390 --> 02:02:09,914
Take somethin' off!

1891
02:02:23,272 --> 02:02:27,368
"Let me entertain you"

1892
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:29,875
A glove! Give 'em a glove!

1893
02:02:30,079 --> 02:02:34,345
"And we'll have a real good time. Yes, sir!

1894
02:02:35,784 --> 02:02:37,809
"We'll have...

1895
02:02:40,422 --> 02:02:43,084
"...a real good time!"

1896
02:02:50,399 --> 02:02:54,062
The Alhambra Theater of Detroit
is happy to present...

1897
02:02:54,136 --> 02:02:56,900
...that lovely newcomer,
Miss Gypsy Rose Lee!

1898
02:03:44,219 --> 02:03:48,656
Philadelphia's Diamond Burlesque
takes pleasure in presenting...

1899
02:03:49,024 --> 02:03:50,787
...that lovely new star...

1900
02:03:51,160 --> 02:03:53,321
...Miss Gypsy Rose Lee.

1901
02:04:12,147 --> 02:04:14,240
Hello everybody. My name's Gypsy.

1902
02:04:14,850 --> 02:04:16,249
What's yours?

1903
02:04:55,424 --> 02:04:59,884
Minsky's world famous burlesque
takes great pride and pleasure...

1904
02:05:00,162 --> 02:05:02,824
...in presenting the queen
of the striptease...

1905
02:05:02,898 --> 02:05:05,628
...the incomparable Miss Gypsy Rose Lee...

1906
02:05:05,934 --> 02:05:08,334
...in our salute to the new year.

1907
02:05:34,396 --> 02:05:39,390
"Let me entertain you

1908
02:05:41,403 --> 02:05:45,567
"Let me make you smile

1909
02:06:02,391 --> 02:06:07,852
"Let me entertain you

1910
02:06:09,064 --> 02:06:12,261
"We'll have a real good

1911
02:06:15,904 --> 02:06:18,566
"And if you're real good

1912
02:06:19,041 --> 02:06:21,976
"I'll make you feel good

"Let me entertain you

02:06:34,223 --> 02:06:39,217
"And we'll have a real good time
Yes, sir!

1916
02:06:40,829 --> 02:06:42,888
"We'll have...

1917
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:47,691
"...a real good time!"

1918
02:07:33,248 --> 02:07:35,113
- Good evening, Mrs. Hovick.
- Good evening.

1919
02:07:35,184 --> 02:07:36,276
Glad to see you.

1920
02:07:36,351 --> 02:07:39,809
If you are, you're the only one.
Who put that sign up on the blackboard?

1921
02:07:39,888 --> 02:07:43,187
I do not know, madame.
I think it was probably a pleasantry.

1922
02:07:43,258 --> 02:07:45,624
I don't think it's a very pleasant pleasantry.

1923
02:07:46,628 --> 02:07:48,596
A cow! What's that for?

1924
02:07:48,831 --> 02:07:51,891
That's a souvenir to remind some people
where they came from...

1925
02:07:51,967 --> 02:07:53,901
...which it wouldn't do any harm.

1926
02:08:05,180 --> 02:08:06,772
Renee, that comes down.

1927
02:08:08,016 --> 02:08:11,474
You need something to remind you
your goal was to be a great actress...

1928
02:08:11,553 --> 02:08:12,986
...not a cheap stripper.

1929
02:08:13,088 --> 02:08:16,251
My sister's the actress, Mother.
And I'm not a cheap stripper.

1930
02:08:16,325 --> 02:08:18,316
I'm the highest paid in the business.

1931
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:20,994
You won't be ready for vaudeville
when it comes back.

1932
02:08:21,063 --> 02:08:22,360
No, I'll be dead.

1933
02:08:23,065 --> 02:08:26,057
- Renee, would you take this tray, please?
- I'll do it.

1934
02:08:26,168 --> 02:08:29,433
Mother, please. And bring my press agent
in as soon as he comes.

1935
02:08:29,538 --> 02:08:30,698
Oui, madame.

1936
02:08:33,709 --> 02:08:36,610
Since when do you fix your face
before you have your bath?

1937
02:08:36,678 --> 02:08:38,407
A photographer is coming.

1938
02:08:38,714 --> 02:08:41,080
Where's he going to photograph you,
in the tub?

1939
02:08:42,317 --> 02:08:43,443
Eventually.

1940
02:08:43,685 --> 02:08:44,674
Louise!

1941
02:08:45,387 --> 02:08:48,288
Mother, it's for a very chic
fashion magazine.

1942
02:08:50,325 --> 02:08:52,384
Do you think I oughta freshen up?

1943
02:08:53,228 --> 02:08:55,093
They only want me in the tub.

1944
02:08:57,666 --> 02:08:58,826
I'll get it.

1945
02:08:59,635 --> 02:09:00,624
Hello.

1946
02:09:03,839 --> 02:09:04,863
Hello.

1947
02:09:07,209 --> 02:09:08,335
No, it's...

1948
02:09:09,912 --> 02:09:11,539
...difficult right now.

1949
02:09:11,747 --> 02:09:13,112
I'm not leaving.

1950
02:09:14,249 --> 02:09:15,944
Let's meet at the party.

1951
02:09:16,385 --> 02:09:17,352
Yes.

1952
02:09:17,786 --> 02:09:19,083
Yes, I promise.

1953
02:09:19,755 --> 02:09:20,847
A bientôt.

1954
02:09:22,057 --> 02:09:23,217
A bien what?

1955
02:09:24,426 --> 02:09:26,587
I guess I am being a little much...

1956
02:09:27,062 --> 02:09:28,757
...but, Mama, I love it.

1957
02:09:30,065 --> 02:09:31,498
Who's givin' the party?

1958
02:09:32,034 --> 02:09:33,092
Some friends.

1959
02:09:33,769 --> 02:09:35,930
In the old days, I used to be asked first.

1960
02:09:37,272 --> 02:09:39,740
I wouldn't go even if I did have
somethin' to wear.

1961
02:09:39,808 --> 02:09:41,605
I got more important things to do.

1962
02:09:41,677 --> 02:09:44,237
Like thinkin' up an idea
for a new strip for us.

1963
02:09:44,713 --> 02:09:48,774
We're still stuck with that wind machine
you bought to blow my clothes off.

1964
02:09:51,353 --> 02:09:54,288
Actually, I'm putting in a new number
on Saturday.

1965
02:09:58,527 --> 02:09:59,619
What is it?

1966
02:10:00,162 --> 02:10:01,288
You'll see.

1967
02:10:02,998 --> 02:10:04,226
I'll see!

1968
02:10:05,767 --> 02:10:07,462
Mama, let me surprise you.

1969
02:10:09,204 --> 02:10:12,662
You're just one big surprise after another
these days, aren't you?

1970
02:10:12,741 --> 02:10:16,438
We'd better go shopping tomorrow
for the material for your dress.

1971
02:10:16,678 --> 02:10:18,942
I have a French lesson tomorrow.

1972
02:10:20,782 --> 02:10:23,478
Well, I'll go alone.
You got any color in mind?

1973
02:10:25,387 --> 02:10:28,185
Mother, I've already started
to make the dress.

1974
02:10:31,026 --> 02:10:33,961
Well, I'll run your bath for you.

1975
02:10:34,629 --> 02:10:37,826
Mama, you don't have to.
That's what I have a maid for.

1976
02:10:37,899 --> 02:10:39,457
Let me do somethin', damn it!

1977
02:10:40,502 --> 02:10:41,491
What, Mother?

1978
02:10:42,571 --> 02:10:44,766
A million things. I'm not a baby.

1979
02:10:45,073 --> 02:10:46,131
Neither am I!

1980
02:10:47,242 --> 02:10:49,369
Don't take that tone with me, young lady.

1981
02:10:49,444 --> 02:10:51,537
- Your sister...
- I am not my sister!

1982
02:10:51,613 --> 02:10:53,843
- You're not Louise either!
- Neither are you!

1983
02:10:53,915 --> 02:10:57,908
Yes, I am! More than you,
Miss Gypsy Rose Lee...

1984
02:10:58,387 --> 02:11:02,653
...with your maids and press agents
and fancy friends with their fancy parties.

1985
02:11:03,258 --> 02:11:07,456
Your loudmouth mother isn't invited to
those high-tone parties. They laugh at her.

1986
02:11:07,529 --> 02:11:09,087
- They don't!
- They do.

1987
02:11:09,498 --> 02:11:12,956
Don't think I don't know that's one reason
you don't want me backstage.

1988
02:11:13,035 --> 02:11:16,300
So I won't hear 'em laugh.
It's them you ought to keep out, not me!

1989
02:11:16,371 --> 02:11:18,635
Because they're laughin' at you, too.

1990
02:11:18,740 --> 02:11:21,004
The burlesque queen who speaks
lousy French...

1991
02:11:21,176 --> 02:11:23,440
...and reads book reviews
like they was books!

1992
02:11:23,512 --> 02:11:24,706
Turn it off, Mother!

1993
02:11:24,780 --> 02:11:27,681
You know what you are to them?
A circus freak.

1994
02:11:27,816 --> 02:11:30,808
This year's novelty act.
And when the bill is changed you'll...

1995
02:11:31,186 --> 02:11:32,949
I said, turn it off!

1996
02:11:33,255 --> 02:11:34,745
Nobody laughs at me!

1997
02:11:34,990 --> 02:11:37,550
Because I laugh first. At me!

1998
02:11:38,226 --> 02:11:41,491
Me, from Seattle! Me, with no education.

1999
02:11:41,563 --> 02:11:45,192
Me, with no talent,
as you kept reminding me my whole life!

2000
02:11:45,634 --> 02:11:47,693
Well, Mama, look at me now.

2001
02:11:47,869 --> 02:11:49,063
I'm a star!

2002
02:11:49,371 --> 02:11:52,101
Look! Look how I live!
Look at my friends!

2003
02:11:52,407 --> 02:11:55,399
Look where I'm going!
I'm not staying in burlesque!

2004
02:11:55,477 --> 02:11:57,707
I'm moving, maybe up, maybe down!

2005
02:11:58,146 --> 02:12:00,341
But wherever it is, I'm enjoying it.

2006
02:12:00,549 --> 02:12:05,111
I'm having the time of my life!
Because for the first time, it is my life!

2007
02:12:05,320 --> 02:12:07,880
And I love it. I love every second of it!

2008
02:12:08,156 --> 02:12:11,284
And I'll be damned if you're gonna
take it away from me!

2009
02:12:11,893 --> 02:12:14,259
I am Gypsy Rose Lee!

2010
02:12:15,063 --> 02:12:16,360
And I love her!

2011
02:12:17,532 --> 02:12:20,126
And if you don't,
you can just clear out now!

2012
02:12:26,308 --> 02:12:28,674
Your press agent is here
with the photographer.

2013
02:12:29,511 --> 02:12:32,241
All right, tell him I'll be ready in a minute.

2014
02:12:35,951 --> 02:12:39,182
Mama, we can't go shouting
seven performances of this a week.

2015
02:12:39,287 --> 02:12:40,754
The whole family shouts.

2016
02:12:40,856 --> 02:12:43,825
It comes from our living
so near the railroad tracks.

2017
02:12:44,326 --> 02:12:46,988
- I'm getting an ulcer.
- You think I'm not?

2018
02:12:47,062 --> 02:12:48,723
Yes, I think you're not!

2019
02:12:48,830 --> 02:12:52,493
If you want an ulcer, get one of your own,
'cause you can't have mine!

2020
02:12:52,567 --> 02:12:53,898
Let's forget it.

2021
02:12:54,269 --> 02:12:55,736
No, let's finish it.

2022
02:12:55,937 --> 02:12:57,370
I should go feed Chowsie.

2023
02:12:57,439 --> 02:13:01,808
Mama, you fought your whole life.
I wish you could just relax now.

2024
02:13:01,877 --> 02:13:05,608
- You need more mascara on your left eye.
- Mama, you've got to let go of me!

2025
02:13:06,348 --> 02:13:07,372
Let go?

2026
02:13:08,783 --> 02:13:10,478
I'll give you anything you want.

2027
02:13:11,786 --> 02:13:12,912
You need me.

2028
02:13:13,288 --> 02:13:15,688
A house, a farm, a school.

2029
02:13:16,892 --> 02:13:18,689
A dramatic school for kids.

2030
02:13:19,261 --> 02:13:21,126
You were always great with kids.

2031
02:13:22,364 --> 02:13:23,422
I'm a pro.

2032
02:13:24,132 --> 02:13:26,862
I'm not an old work horse
you can turn out to pasture...

2033
02:13:26,935 --> 02:13:29,870
...just because you think you're riding
high on your own.

2034
02:13:32,807 --> 02:13:35,002
Mama, no kid does it all on his own.

2035
02:13:35,977 --> 02:13:37,740
I'm not a kid anymore.

2036
02:13:39,247 --> 02:13:41,374
And from now on, even if I flop...

2037
02:13:42,417 --> 02:13:43,907
...I flop on my own.

2038
02:13:48,490 --> 02:13:50,617
Hey, Gyp, what do you say?

2039
02:13:50,825 --> 02:13:54,386
"So long, Rose." That's what she says.
"Don't slam the door as you leave."

2040
02:13:54,462 --> 02:13:58,330
Hi, Rose. Gyps, baby, may I present
Monsieur Bougeron-Cochet.

2041
02:13:58,934 --> 02:14:01,801
- Enchantée, monsieur.
- Enchanté, mademoiselle.

2042
02:14:01,903 --> 02:14:03,029
Excusez-moi.

2043
02:14:03,205 --> 02:14:06,936
Let's make with the oiseau, kiddies.
One before you take the plunge, Gyps.

2044
02:14:07,042 --> 02:14:08,134
Get ready now.

2045
02:14:08,343 --> 02:14:11,710
All right, miss,
but just one thing I wanna know.

2046
02:14:12,681 --> 02:14:15,149
All the pushing and workin' and fenaglin'...

2047
02:14:15,250 --> 02:14:18,742
...all the scrimpin' and the schemin'
and lyin' awake nights figurin':

2048
02:14:19,321 --> 02:14:21,619
How do we get from one town to the next?

2049
02:14:21,690 --> 02:14:23,521
How do we all eat on a buck?

2050
02:14:23,959 --> 02:14:26,086
How do I make an act out of nothin'?

2051
02:14:26,695 --> 02:14:29,528
What did I do it for?
You said I fought all my life.

2052
02:14:30,165 --> 02:14:31,996
I fought all your life.

2053
02:14:32,500 --> 02:14:35,526
So now, tell me, what did I do it for?

2054
02:14:39,474 --> 02:14:41,601
I thought you did it for me, Mama.

2055
02:14:55,890 --> 02:14:57,915
Come on smile, Gyps.

2056
02:14:58,493 --> 02:14:59,983
Show us your talent.

2057
02:15:01,763 --> 02:15:02,855
That's it.

2058
02:15:18,913 --> 02:15:21,074
"I thought you did it for me, Mama."

2059
02:15:22,317 --> 02:15:25,377
"I thought you did it for me, Mama."

2060
02:15:28,790 --> 02:15:31,759
I thought you made a no-talent ox
into a star because...

2061
02:15:31,860 --> 02:15:34,351
...you like doin' things
the hard way, Mama.

2062
02:15:36,197 --> 02:15:37,789
And you have no talent.

2063
02:15:39,467 --> 02:15:42,732
Not what I call talent,
Miss Gypsy Rose Lee.

2064
02:15:44,005 --> 02:15:45,131
I made you.

2065
02:15:46,374 --> 02:15:47,500
I made you!

2066
02:15:48,943 --> 02:15:50,535
And you wanna know why?

2067
02:15:51,880 --> 02:15:54,075
You wanna know what I did it for?

2068
02:15:56,284 --> 02:15:59,651
Because I was born too soon
and started too late, that's why.

2069
02:16:01,589 --> 02:16:03,079
What I got in me...

2070
02:16:05,393 --> 02:16:07,691
I could've been better than any of you.

2071
02:16:09,631 --> 02:16:11,064
What I got in me...

2072
02:16:12,767 --> 02:16:15,463
...what I've been holdin' down
inside of me...

2073
02:16:16,404 --> 02:16:18,133
...if I ever let it go...

2074
02:16:19,841 --> 02:16:22,503
...there wouldn't have been signs
big enough.

2075
02:16:23,545 --> 02:16:25,809
There wouldn't have been lights
bright enough.

2076
02:16:26,681 --> 02:16:29,013
Here she is, boys!

2077
02:16:30,285 --> 02:16:32,754
Here she is, world!

2078
02:16:34,322 --> 02:16:36,483
Here's Rose!

2079
02:16:41,997 --> 02:16:43,156
"Curtain up

2080
02:16:45,867 --> 02:16:47,232
"Light the lights

2081
02:16:49,104 --> 02:16:50,435
"Play it, boys

2082
02:16:53,975 --> 02:16:57,002
"You either got it or you ain't

2083
02:16:57,979 --> 02:16:59,470
"And, boys, I got it

2084
02:17:02,484 --> 02:17:03,679
"You like it?

2085
02:17:06,287 --> 02:17:07,721
"Well, I got it

2086
02:17:10,926 --> 02:17:14,486
"Some people got it and make it pay

2087
02:17:15,063 --> 02:17:18,362
"Some people can't even give it away

2088
02:17:19,100 --> 02:17:20,692
"This people's got it

2089
02:17:21,035 --> 02:17:24,972
"And this people's spreadin' it around

2090
02:17:26,741 --> 02:17:31,873
"You either have it, or you've had it"

2091
02:17:35,584 --> 02:17:36,982
Hello, everybody.

2092
02:17:37,318 --> 02:17:40,651
My name's Rose. What's yours?

2093
02:17:43,158 --> 02:17:46,150
How do you like them egg rolls,
Mr. Goldstone?

2094
02:17:47,362 --> 02:17:51,459
"Hold your hats and hallelujah
Mama's gonna show it to you

2095
02:18:03,244 --> 02:18:06,544
"Ready or not
Here comes Mama

2096
02:18:07,148 --> 02:18:09,981
"Mama's talkin' loud
Mama's doin' fine

2097
02:18:10,085 --> 02:18:13,019
"Mama's gettin' hot
Mama's goin' strong

2098
02:18:13,088 --> 02:18:15,783
"Mama's movin' on
Mama's all alone

2099
02:18:15,958 --> 02:18:18,687
"Mama doesn't care
Mama's lettin' loose

2100
02:18:18,893 --> 02:18:21,521
"Mama's got the stuff
Mama's lettin' go

2101
02:18:21,797 --> 02:18:23,195
"Mama, Mama

2102
02:18:24,166 --> 02:18:27,066
"Mama's got the stuff
Mama's gotta move

2103
02:18:27,169 --> 02:18:28,533
"Mama's gotta go

2104
02:18:28,671 --> 02:18:30,069
"Mama, Mama

2105
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:32,329
"Mama's gotta let go

2106
02:18:38,914 --> 02:18:40,278
"Why did I do it?

2107
02:18:43,919 --> 02:18:45,408
"What did it get me?

2108
02:18:47,723 --> 02:18:50,214
"Scrapbooks full of me in the background

2109
02:18:52,694 --> 02:18:55,162
"Give 'em love and what does it get you?

2110
02:18:56,364 --> 02:19:00,061
"What does it get you?
One quick look as each of 'em leaves you

2111
02:19:02,704 --> 02:19:05,036
"All your life and what does it get you?

2112
02:19:05,207 --> 02:19:07,505
"Thanks a lot
And out with the garbage

2113
02:19:07,676 --> 02:19:10,143
"They take bows
And you're battin' zero

2114
02:19:15,084 --> 02:19:18,075
"I had a dream

2115
02:19:19,287 --> 02:19:23,725
"I dreamed it for you, June

2116
02:19:24,692 --> 02:19:28,220
"It wasn't for me, Herbie

2117
02:19:28,998 --> 02:19:31,626
"And if it wasn't for me

2118
02:19:31,900 --> 02:19:34,266
"Just where would you be

2119
02:19:34,336 --> 02:19:37,635
"Miss Gypsy Rose Lee?

2120
02:19:39,875 --> 02:19:42,503
"Well, someone tell me
When is it my turn?

2121
02:19:42,577 --> 02:19:44,671
"Don't I get a dream for myself?

2122
02:19:44,847 --> 02:19:47,076
"Startin' now, it's gonna be my turn

2123
02:19:47,182 --> 02:19:49,479
"Gangway, world,
Get off of my runway

2124
02:19:49,552 --> 02:19:51,815
"Startin' now, I bat a thousand

2125
02:19:51,887 --> 02:19:54,583
"This time, boys, I'm takin' the bows

2126
02:19:54,790 --> 02:19:58,055
"And everything's comin' up Rose

2127
02:19:59,661 --> 02:20:02,961
"Everything's comin' up roses

2128
02:20:04,266 --> 02:20:07,258
"Everything's comin' up roses

2129
02:20:07,535 --> 02:20:09,696
"This time for me

2130
02:20:12,073 --> 02:20:13,062
"For me

2131
02:20:21,717 --> 02:20:25,152
"For me"

2132
02:20:43,505 --> 02:20:46,735
Just tryin' out a few ideas
I thought you might wanna use.

2133
02:20:48,377 --> 02:20:50,504
You'd really have been something, Mother.

2134
02:20:52,214 --> 02:20:53,202
Think so?

2135
02:20:53,415 --> 02:20:55,883
If you had had someone to push you
like I did.

2136
02:20:57,185 --> 02:21:00,985
If I could have been, I would have been.
That's show business.

2137
02:21:02,958 --> 02:21:05,448
About that school for kids, like you said.

2138
02:21:06,027 --> 02:21:07,654
I could open one, but...

2139
02:21:10,031 --> 02:21:11,396
...kids grow up.

2140
02:21:11,834 --> 02:21:13,994
Anyway, I guess I did it for myself.

2141
02:21:15,504 --> 02:21:16,664
Why, Mother?

2142
02:21:19,273 --> 02:21:20,969
Just wanted to be noticed.

2143
02:21:22,443 --> 02:21:24,469
Like I wanted you to notice me.

2144
02:21:27,383 --> 02:21:28,815
I still do, Mama.

2145
02:21:34,123 --> 02:21:35,249
Louise.

2146
02:21:38,493 --> 02:21:39,619
Okay, Mama.

2147
02:21:41,430 --> 02:21:42,556
Okay, Rose.

2148
02:21:43,432 --> 02:21:46,229
Say, you look like you should speak French.

2149
02:21:47,535 --> 02:21:49,730
You're coming to that party with me.

2150
02:21:50,104 --> 02:21:50,934
No.

2151
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:52,267
Come on.

2152
02:21:52,675 --> 02:21:53,766
Like this?

2153
02:21:54,308 --> 02:21:57,903
Here, you can wear my mink.
I've got a stole in the car.

2154
02:22:00,082 --> 02:22:01,049
Well...

2155
02:22:01,482 --> 02:22:03,417
...only for an hour or two.

2156
02:22:05,186 --> 02:22:06,176
Say...

2157
02:22:06,588 --> 02:22:10,489
...this looks better on me than on you.
Funny how we can wear the same size.

2158
02:22:11,225 --> 02:22:12,557
Especially in mink.

2159
02:22:12,628 --> 02:22:14,755
You know, I had a dream last night.

2160
02:22:14,829 --> 02:22:17,094
It was a big poster
of a mother and daughter.

2161
02:22:17,166 --> 02:22:19,656
You know, like the cover
of that ladies' magazine.

2162
02:22:19,734 --> 02:22:20,860
Yes, Mother.

2163
02:22:20,969 --> 02:22:24,803
Only it was you and me,
wearing exactly the same gown.

2164
02:22:24,906 --> 02:22:27,967
It was an ad for Minsky
and the headline said:

2165
02:22:30,012 --> 02:22:32,241
"Madame Rose...

2166
02:22:35,718 --> 02:22:38,743
"...and her daughter Gypsy!"
