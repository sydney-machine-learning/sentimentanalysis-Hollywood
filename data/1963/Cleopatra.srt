1
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,532
<i>And so it fell out</i>
<i>that at Pharsalia...</i>

2
00:04:56,733 --> 00:05:00,726
<i>... the great might and manhood of Rome</i>
<i>met in bloody civil war...</i>

3
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:04,892
<i>... and Caesar's legions</i>
<i>destroyed those of the great Pompey...</i>

4
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:08,483
<i>... so that now only Caesar</i>
<i>stood at the head of Rome.</i>

5
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:13,130
<i>But there was no joy for Caesar</i>
<i>as in his other triumphs...</i>

6
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:18,248
<i>... for the dead which his legions</i>
<i>counted and buried and burned...</i>

7
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:20,211
<i>... were their own countrymen.</i>

8
00:05:22,093 --> 00:05:25,642
The smoke of burning Roman dead
is just as black...

9
00:05:25,853 --> 00:05:29,084
...and the stink no less.

10
00:05:29,293 --> 00:05:32,012
It was Pompey, not I,
who wanted it so.

11
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:34,727
Let what I have said be set down.

12
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:38,724
You may stand.

13
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:45,892
Do not try and impress me by looking
either too penitent or too proud.

14
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:49,449
As field officers,
you fought miserably for Pompey.

15
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:52,963
Men under your command will be
permitted to enlist in my legions...

16
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:55,482
...and returned to Rome as Romans.

17
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:57,490
You shall have the same privilege.

18
00:05:57,693 --> 00:06:00,924
I'm not magnanimous. Your names
are marked. You'll be watched.

19
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:03,442
First sign of treachery,
you'll be killed.

20
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:06,326
What is it, Flavius? Antony?

21
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,730
Oh, yes. Canidius.
With news of Pompey, I hope.

22
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:45,891
- Hail Caesar!
- Drink that in my name, Canidius.

23
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:49,489
To all Marc Antony's cavalry,
Caesar's left wing and right arm.

24
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:51,610
What news of Pompey, or what's left?

25
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:54,484
Pompey's gone, Caesar.

26
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:57,924
Slipped through our fingers,
disguised as a peddler.

27
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:01,284
- Leaving most of his merchandise.
- Gone? Where?

28
00:07:01,493 --> 00:07:05,771
He has a galley waiting at the coast.
Provision enough for Egypt, they say.

29
00:07:05,973 --> 00:07:10,763
Egypt. Possibly.
They owe him a great deal.

30
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:14,682
He'll ask for sanctuary.
Borrow money, borrow time.

31
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:18,363
I thought it was over.
It seems it's not.

32
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:21,292
Rufio, consult the augurers.
I want to know.

33
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:24,371
In Egypt, will Pompey face me at last?

34
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:28,841
But surely Caesar will now
return to Rome!

35
00:07:29,053 --> 00:07:30,725
I must go to Egypt in any case.

36
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:34,045
King Ptolemy and his sister
have a civil war of their own...

37
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:38,326
...intent on destroying each other,
and in the process, Rome's wheat.

38
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:40,211
That cannot be so urgent.

39
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:43,450
Let the Romans welcome
great Caesar properly at last...

40
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:45,689
...in this greatest of his triumphs.

41
00:07:45,893 --> 00:07:49,681
Triumph? Over what?

42
00:07:49,893 --> 00:07:52,168
Over whom?

43
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:54,170
- Canidius.
- Caesar?

44
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:57,644
Leave me the 10th and 12th.
Antony's to take the rest to Rome.

45
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,969
- When can he start?
- Whenever you say.

46
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,965
Then at once.

47
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:07,049
And in Rome,
Marc Antony is to speak for Caesar.

48
00:08:07,293 --> 00:08:09,045
His authority is not to be questioned.

49
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:11,050
His word will be yours.

50
00:08:11,253 --> 00:08:12,925
As always, Caesar's word is law.

51
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,452
Of course.

52
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:18,646
But remind him to keep his legions
intact. They make the law legal.

53
00:08:18,893 --> 00:08:19,882
Caesar.

54
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:34,612
<i>And even as Caesar's galleys</i>
<i>sailed the great sea to Egypt...</i>

55
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:37,725
<i>... it was happening that,</i>
<i>just as the Romans...</i>

56
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:41,289
<i>... so the Egyptians made war,</i>
<i>one upon the other...</i>

57
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:44,570
<i>... for King Ptolemy would no longer</i>
<i>share the throne...</i>

58
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:46,804
<i>... with his sister Cleopatra...</i>

59
00:08:47,013 --> 00:08:49,481
<i>... but drove her</i>
<i>from the city of Alexandria...</i>

60
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:52,730
<i>... and sought to destroy her.</i>

61
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,129
We've arrived on their market day.

62
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:54,967
Once a week they're allowed
in the royal enclosure.

63
00:09:55,173 --> 00:09:57,243
Where's the guard of honor for Caesar?

64
00:09:57,453 --> 00:09:59,921
Some representative
of the royal or military?

65
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:49,889
We have the privilege of watching
Caesar battle through our marketplace.

66
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:54,251
Marcellus, a dozen front-rank men,
swords only.

67
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:56,723
Clear a direct line
to the palace steps.

68
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:59,401
Then as many more to keep it open.

69
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:03,606
It's precisely what they hope we'd do:
Manhandle their people.

70
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:07,089
No. This is their market day,
we will go marketing.

71
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:10,603
- You're not serious.
- We'll shop our way to the palace.

72
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:14,488
Have you my money?
Everything is to be paid for by coin.

73
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:17,412
Tell them to put away the swords
and carry moneybags.

74
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:42,730
Olives. Oil of olives.

75
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:45,049
Ah, the wine of Samos.

76
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:48,006
How much for your wine? Four drachma.

77
00:11:48,213 --> 00:11:50,169
Sixty of your wine for my men.

78
00:11:50,373 --> 00:11:52,170
Pay him.

79
00:11:52,373 --> 00:11:54,250
Pay him.

80
00:11:57,493 --> 00:12:00,405
You said they'd push the people
and make them angry.

81
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:03,332
Why aren't they doing
what you said they'd do?

82
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:06,172
Your king has asked a question,
Lord Chamberlain.

83
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:10,968
The Romans have degenerated minds,
Most High Majesty.

84
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:13,289
They do the unexpected.

85
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:16,166
Particularly one Roman.

86
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:18,603
Master of the unexpected.

87
00:12:18,813 --> 00:12:21,566
But with so few men.

88
00:12:28,853 --> 00:12:30,525
You all look so impressive.

89
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:32,570
Any one of you could be king.

90
00:12:32,813 --> 00:12:35,008
His Divine Majesty, my Lord Ptolemy...

91
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,568
...Iord of the Upper
and Lower regions...

92
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:40,241
...son of Ra, of Horus and of Thoth,
beloved of...

93
00:12:40,453 --> 00:12:42,887
Et cetera, et cetera. You welcome me.

94
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:46,051
And I, Gaius Julius Caesar,
Pontifex Maximus...

95
00:12:46,253 --> 00:12:48,483
...et cetera, et cetera, thank you.

96
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:51,765
From the Senate and people
of Rome, hail King Ptolemy.

97
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:55,767
And his sister and co-ruler,
Queen Cleopatra?

98
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:59,369
They won't tell you so,
but Cleopatra's dead.

99
00:12:59,573 --> 00:13:02,804
She tried to kill me,
and we chased her into the desert.

100
00:13:03,013 --> 00:13:04,571
And there she died.

101
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:07,924
Whereas it is true
that His Majesty's sister...

102
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:10,448
...repeatedly plotted
to have him killed...

103
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:12,848
...it is not true
that Cleopatra is dead.

104
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:15,886
Whereas it is true that she
fled from Alexandria...

105
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:18,010
I seem to always interrupt you...

106
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:20,852
...but the search for truth
can go on and on.

107
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:22,247
Pothinus, is it not?

108
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:25,883
Lord Chamberlain and chief eunuch
to King Ptolemy. An exalted rank.

109
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:30,445
Obtained not without certain,
shall we say, sacrifice.

110
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:32,371
Theodotus, am I right?

111
00:13:32,573 --> 00:13:36,486
Tutor to His Majesty in history,
philosophy and ambition.

112
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:39,207
And Achillas.
They say you're a good soldier.

113
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:42,928
- As one to another, where is Cleopatra?
- With her army.

114
00:13:43,173 --> 00:13:45,892
And how many of your men
between her and Alexandria?

115
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:48,806
- Enough.
- May I speak?

116
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:51,049
Surely you have come in peace.

117
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:55,485
And we present ourselves to you
in warm and respectful welcome.

118
00:13:55,693 --> 00:13:59,652
Our only problem being an
internal one, of concern only to us...

119
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:01,485
...why have you come, Caesar?

120
00:14:02,213 --> 00:14:06,001
As we all know, when the father
of both Ptolemy and Cleopatra died...

121
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:09,649
...he named the two of them
to rule jointly over Egypt.

122
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:13,971
Rome was appointed their guardian
and the executor of his will.

123
00:14:14,173 --> 00:14:17,961
I have come in the name of Rome to ask
why Cleopatra has been deposed...

124
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:21,165
...to resolve the differences
between her and King Ptolemy...

125
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:25,605
...and to see that they peacefully
resume their joint rule of Egypt.

126
00:14:25,813 --> 00:14:29,123
That will be difficult.
Cleopatra has forfeited her right.

127
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:31,443
I shall try to decide justly.

128
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:34,884
Don't you see he'll send for her?
He'll bring her back!

129
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:38,642
The sun which sheds its grace
upon the ruler of the two lands...

130
00:14:38,853 --> 00:14:40,491
...burns too brightly perhaps.

131
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:42,524
If Lord Ptolemy wishes to retire...

132
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:44,411
I wish nothing of the kind!

133
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:48,652
I won't be put out of the way
until I've watched you give him that!

134
00:14:50,453 --> 00:14:53,251
A thousand pardons,
I had almost forgotten.

135
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:58,248
Lord Ptolemy wishes to enhance his
welcome by a gift of some importance.

136
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:00,851
Most generous.

137
00:15:01,413 --> 00:15:03,847
The ring. Give him Pompey's ring.

138
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:18,244
And now the token of
His Majesty's affection for Rome...

139
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:20,842
...and regard for Caesar.

140
00:15:33,293 --> 00:15:35,124
Pompey the Great.

141
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:41,882
Dead men, they say, do not bite.

142
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:45,649
Does it please you, Caesar?

143
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:48,242
They said it would
please you very much.

144
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:54,250
The sun does shed its grace
too brightly.

145
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:58,051
It has become too hot here for kings.

146
00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:01,051
My Lord Ptolemy will retire.

147
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:19,642
For His Majesty,
a Roman guard of honor.

148
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:32,647
It was not by your hand, of course.

149
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:37,246
Lf, as you say, you've been told
of me, you know better, Caesar.

150
00:16:39,693 --> 00:16:41,843
My men shall be
properly housed and fed.

151
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:44,288
- May I speak?
- Not until you're spoken to.

152
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:46,245
I'll require rooms in the palace.

153
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:49,331
I shall consider myself
honored to escort you.

154
00:16:49,693 --> 00:16:51,445
Anyone but you.

155
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:56,125
Find the rest of Pompey.

156
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,052
Tear out a thousand tongues,
but find him.

157
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:00,966
Have him purified...

158
00:17:01,173 --> 00:17:04,051
...the coin in the mouth
and the rest, honorably.

159
00:17:04,813 --> 00:17:06,246
Of course.

160
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,889
For now, this is what we must hold.

161
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:47,323
Moon gate and three others.
Here, here and here.

162
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,966
How are we placed?

163
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:51,647
The 10th slingers on the moon gate.
The rest in reserve.

164
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:54,771
The 12th holding all other positions.
Very thin.

165
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:56,446
For now, deep enough.

166
00:17:56,693 --> 00:17:59,890
- And the wells?
- The water's brackish, but drinkable.

167
00:18:00,093 --> 00:18:03,051
So far. Keep an eye on them.
Watch the corn and wheat.

168
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:05,972
With our supplies secure,
we can hold indefinitely.

169
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:10,451
For a week, perhaps,
but for the time being, time enough.

170
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:12,052
What do you want?

171
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,844
Is the man to be trusted?

172
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:23,083
Seems someone's brought me a gift...

173
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:25,244
...from Queen Cleopatra.

174
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:29,484
Apparently, a rug peddler.

175
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,092
Flavius doubts it.

176
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,324
He seems to know the palace very well.

177
00:18:33,573 --> 00:18:37,361
He appeared through a secret passage
which none of the men knew.

178
00:18:37,773 --> 00:18:41,049
Pothinus might send an assassin
in Cleopatra's name.

179
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:43,249
Have the man brought in.

180
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:02,050
Are you the one
who brings a gift from Cleopatra?

181
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:03,841
Put it down and go.

182
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:07,887
It is the command of my queen
I deliver her gift personally.

183
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:10,129
I am Caesar. Lay it here before me.

184
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:13,365
Forgive me, Admiral Agrippa,
but you're not Caesar.

185
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:16,081
Nor you, General Rufio.
Nor you, Germanicus.

186
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:18,887
My queen's gift is for
the eyes of Caesar...

187
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:20,646
...alone.

188
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,168
- It seems harmless enough.
- No, Caesar!

189
00:19:23,373 --> 00:19:27,286
You can lend me your sword, Rufio.
It may require some cutting.

190
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:37,764
Odd way to carry a rug.

191
00:19:37,973 --> 00:19:40,612
Isn't it easier
to sling it over your shoulder?

192
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,202
It was less comfortable that way.

193
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:47,206
- For you or the rug?
- That sword, Caesar.

194
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:51,042
The rug is such a delicate weave.
If I may untie it for you.

195
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:53,721
Turn it over first.

196
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:57,648
- The rug is right-side up.
- I want it the wrong side up.

197
00:19:57,853 --> 00:20:00,731
- Should I flip it over with my sword?
- No.

198
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:09,492
I find one can tell more
about the quality of merchandise...

199
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:12,566
...by examining the back side first.

200
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,449
All hail Cleopatra,
kindred of Horus and Ra...

201
00:20:19,693 --> 00:20:22,651
...beloved of the moon and sun,
daughter to Isis...

202
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:26,442
...and of Upper and Lower Egypt,
queen.

203
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:38,046
Thank you.

204
00:20:38,293 --> 00:20:39,692
Here.

205
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:44,253
Take this to the captain
of the night watch.

206
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:47,843
He'll see the queen's quarters
are made ready to her.

207
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:50,244
Stay where you are.

208
00:20:50,453 --> 00:20:53,570
- Have I dismissed you?
- No, Your Majesty.

209
00:20:53,813 --> 00:20:55,644
This is my palace, Caesar.

210
00:20:55,893 --> 00:20:58,691
All of it
is available to me at my will.

211
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:02,642
I am not your prisoner.
If anything, you are my guest.

212
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:03,882
Most kind.

213
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:07,449
And as for having my quarters,
as you put it, made ready...

214
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:11,049
...my chief handmaiden has, by now,
brought the others out of hiding.

215
00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:12,971
They should almost be finished.

216
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:15,443
Impossible.
The doors are under guard.

217
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:17,723
There are doors, and doors.

218
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,052
Of course.

219
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:23,802
You must take me on a tour someday
within the walls of your palace.

220
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:26,686
- What are you waiting for?
- Permission to leave.

221
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:28,252
Granted.

222
00:21:29,173 --> 00:21:30,401
Apollodorus.

223
00:21:32,253 --> 00:21:33,845
Thank you.

224
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,850
I'm pleased you received my summons
and were able to...

225
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:48,285
Summons? I'm pleased to say
I received nothing of the kind.

226
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:51,047
I'm surprised you thought
I would answer one.

227
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:53,483
Young lady, the voyage
in your carpet...

228
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:56,850
...has apparently not tired you,
but I'm exhausted.

229
00:21:57,133 --> 00:22:00,170
Caesar, it is essential
we understand each other.

230
00:22:00,413 --> 00:22:02,643
Only through me
can you hope to escape...

231
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:05,845
...the desperate situation
in which you find yourself.

232
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,324
I wouldn't bite into that.

233
00:22:08,973 --> 00:22:12,363
Did you bring it with you?
Have you had it tasted?

234
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:14,484
If neither, it's probably poisoned.

235
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:19,045
At least it's another way out of the
desperate situation in which I'm found.

236
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:24,051
You're being tolerant of me,
aren't you?

237
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,893
Is it because you're so much older?

238
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:32,723
Your maps are inferior.
Out-of-date, compared to mine.

239
00:22:33,093 --> 00:22:35,288
They and I have aged together.

240
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:37,842
The lakes to the west
are poorly marked...

241
00:22:38,053 --> 00:22:40,772
...certain important hill positions
not even noted.

242
00:22:41,253 --> 00:22:45,041
I must arrange for you to address
my mapmakers and general staff.

243
00:22:47,293 --> 00:22:49,932
We've gotten off to a bad start,
haven't we?

244
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:52,371
I've rubbed you the wrong way.

245
00:22:53,013 --> 00:22:56,642
I'm not sure I want to be
rubbed by you at all, young lady.

246
00:22:59,613 --> 00:23:02,127
It is permissible
for me to sit, is it not?

247
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:10,045
As quickly as possible you must
set me alone on the throne of Egypt.

248
00:23:10,293 --> 00:23:13,808
My mission is to put to an end
to your tiresome squabbling.

249
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:16,243
You're not a fool. Or are you?

250
00:23:16,453 --> 00:23:18,648
Lmmodestly, perhaps, no.

251
00:23:18,893 --> 00:23:21,282
You've seen my brother
and listened to him?

252
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,093
And that truly evil man
to whom he belongs?

253
00:23:25,453 --> 00:23:26,488
Yes.

254
00:23:27,893 --> 00:23:30,453
Shall we agree upon what Rome
really wants...

255
00:23:30,653 --> 00:23:32,371
...has always wanted of Egypt?

256
00:23:32,613 --> 00:23:36,686
Corn, grain, treasure.
It's the old story.

257
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:40,130
Roman greatness built
upon Egyptian riches.

258
00:23:40,573 --> 00:23:43,929
You shall have them.
You shall have them all and in peace.

259
00:23:44,573 --> 00:23:46,450
But there is only one way.

260
00:23:46,693 --> 00:23:49,526
My way. Make me queen.

261
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:52,483
That sounds very much
like an ultimatum.

262
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:54,166
There is no other way.

263
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:57,247
For one whose assets,
up to a few moments ago...

264
00:23:57,493 --> 00:24:00,053
...was a devoted slave
and a rolled-up carpet...

265
00:24:00,293 --> 00:24:02,249
But I have you now, Caesar.

266
00:24:02,493 --> 00:24:04,165
Besides, there are my armies...

267
00:24:04,413 --> 00:24:07,644
...and the simple fact that
no mortal hand can destroy me.

268
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:10,642
Yes, I recall some
mention of an obsession...

269
00:24:10,853 --> 00:24:12,844
...you have about your divinity.

270
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:15,001
Isis, is it not?

271
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:20,126
I shall have to insist
that you mind what you say.

272
00:24:20,373 --> 00:24:24,605
I am Isis. I am worshiped
by millions who believe it.

273
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:27,045
Do not confuse what I am...

274
00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:29,568
...with the so-called divine origin...

275
00:24:29,813 --> 00:24:33,362
...that every Roman general acquires
together with his shield.

276
00:24:33,613 --> 00:24:38,812
It was Venus you chose to be
descended from, wasn't it?

277
00:24:39,693 --> 00:24:42,048
I must now do a little
insisting of my own.

278
00:24:42,293 --> 00:24:44,966
The journey has tired you
and you wish to retire.

279
00:24:45,213 --> 00:24:47,886
I am not your servant, Caesar.
Do not dismiss me.

280
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:50,408
Secondly, you have no armies,
young lady.

281
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:53,292
They are gone because
you could not pay them.

282
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,286
Egypt's riches are not
available for your use...

283
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:59,172
...much less to give away.
Perhaps in a day or two...

284
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:01,643
...we can speak again.
- That may be too late...

285
00:25:01,893 --> 00:25:02,962
...for both of us.

286
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:05,773
Your safety will be
my responsibility.

287
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:08,889
And what about your own?

288
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,727
I am prepared, I believe,
for the time being.

289
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:13,886
I hope so.

290
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:17,531
I hope you are as wise,
as brilliant...

291
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:19,650
...the god they say you are.

292
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:23,249
You Roman generals
become divine so quickly.

293
00:25:23,613 --> 00:25:26,764
A few victories, a few massacres.

294
00:25:27,013 --> 00:25:29,846
Only yesterday, Pompey was a god.

295
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:32,772
- They murdered him, didn't they?
- Yes.

296
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:35,647
Because they thought
it would please you.

297
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:38,845
- It didn't, did it?
- No.

298
00:25:40,653 --> 00:25:44,771
Today I found myself remembering
how much my daughter loved him.

299
00:25:45,013 --> 00:25:47,652
She died trying
to bear him a son.

300
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:49,925
Gave him this ring.

301
00:25:51,613 --> 00:25:54,252
Sleep well tonight, Caesar.

302
00:25:54,813 --> 00:25:56,929
These next days may
be difficult for you.

303
00:25:57,693 --> 00:25:59,126
Good night.

304
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:06,164
Germanicus, a guard to escort
Queen Cleopatra to her apartments.

305
00:26:06,413 --> 00:26:07,482
Guards!

306
00:26:17,813 --> 00:26:20,452
The corridors are dark, gentlemen.

307
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:23,242
But you mustn't be afraid.

308
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,692
Haven't we covered everything
we can tonight, sir?

309
00:26:38,893 --> 00:26:42,249
- Perhaps a fresh start in the morning.
- No, a few more matters.

310
00:26:42,453 --> 00:26:45,650
Rufio, has it occurred to you
that our maps of this area...

311
00:26:45,853 --> 00:26:48,003
...are not quite what they should be?

312
00:26:48,213 --> 00:26:50,681
Why, no. What makes you
think they're not?

313
00:26:50,893 --> 00:26:53,009
I have an instinct about these things.

314
00:27:01,693 --> 00:27:03,490
- Actually of Macedonian descent.

315
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:05,928
No officially admitted Egyptian blood.

316
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:09,285
"Reputed to be extremely intelligent
and sharp of wit.

317
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:12,843
Queen Cleopatra is widely read.
Well-versed in the sciences...

318
00:27:13,093 --> 00:27:14,048
...and mathematics.

319
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,893
She speaks seven languages
proficiently.

320
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:20,364
Were she not a woman, she'd be
considered an intellectual."

321
00:27:21,413 --> 00:27:23,688
Nothing bores me so much
as an intellectual.

322
00:27:24,053 --> 00:27:26,169
Makes a better admiral of you,
Agrippa.

323
00:27:27,293 --> 00:27:29,727
Here's something
of more interest to the navy:

324
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:34,563
"In obtaining her objectives, she has
been known to use torture, poison...

325
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:38,607
...and even her own sexual talents,
which are said to be considerable.

326
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:43,121
Her lovers, I am told, are listed
more easily by number than by name.

327
00:27:43,373 --> 00:27:46,251
It is said that she chooses
in the manner of a man...

328
00:27:46,453 --> 00:27:49,172
...rather than wait to be chosen
in womanly fashion."

329
00:27:49,413 --> 00:27:51,802
Well, there's more reason
than we thought...

330
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:54,851
...for not wanting to leave
you two alone, eh, sir?

331
00:27:55,053 --> 00:27:56,771
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

332
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,089
Are you inclined to trust Cleopatra?

333
00:27:59,613 --> 00:28:01,808
Trust? Not for a minute.

334
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:06,365
"Trust." The word has always
made me apprehensive.

335
00:28:06,613 --> 00:28:10,572
Like wine, whenever I've tried it,
the aftereffects have not been good.

336
00:28:10,813 --> 00:28:12,041
So I've given up wine...

337
00:28:12,573 --> 00:28:13,926
...and trusting.

338
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:17,531
Oh, it's been a long
and difficult day, gentlemen.

339
00:28:17,773 --> 00:28:21,004
The next few may be even longer
and more difficult.

340
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:23,568
- Good night.
- Good night.

341
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:02,046
Flavius!

342
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:06,446
Flavius!

343
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:04,410
"It is autumn again,
My best-loved Lesbia

344
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:09,482
Look, the torrents of Roman leaves
Are falling, falling

345
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:13,003
And lovers revive in kisses
The promise of spring

346
00:31:13,213 --> 00:31:17,411
Which will end the winter world
With new nightingales calling."

347
00:31:17,613 --> 00:31:19,763
I taste your food, daughter of Isis...

348
00:31:19,973 --> 00:31:23,568
...and if there be harm in it,
let the harm fall upon me.

349
00:31:23,773 --> 00:31:26,162
"But love must bring
Despair one day

350
00:31:26,373 --> 00:31:28,807
As beauty, sorrow."

351
00:31:33,573 --> 00:31:37,566
- Why do you stop, Phoebus?
- In the corridor, there is movement.

352
00:31:38,693 --> 00:31:40,923
That's how the Romans
frighten the enemy...

353
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:44,921
...by stamping their elephant feet.
- No, this is one man...

354
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:46,845
...followed by others.

355
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:50,370
- Caesar, I would say.
- Would you?

356
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:56,762
We must not disappoint
the mighty Caesar.

357
00:31:56,973 --> 00:32:00,090
The Romans tell fabulous tales
of my bath...

358
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:02,369
...and handmaidens...

359
00:32:02,613 --> 00:32:04,843
...and my morals.

360
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:10,044
Cleopatra's requested my presence.

361
00:32:10,253 --> 00:32:13,290
- That was yesterday, Caesar.
- I've been occupied.

362
00:32:13,493 --> 00:32:17,566
The queen is occupied with her bath.
Perhaps Caesar could return later...

363
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:20,646
...or tomorrow.
- I'm afraid not. Hold him.

364
00:32:20,893 --> 00:32:22,690
No, don't hurt him.

365
00:32:22,893 --> 00:32:24,611
You're a good man, Apollodorus.

366
00:32:24,813 --> 00:32:26,451
I hope you're appreciated.

367
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:29,251
Wait here for me.

368
00:32:45,773 --> 00:32:48,492
"Ah, then let us live and love
Without one thought

369
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:53,045
For the gossip of virgins
Now grown old and stale

370
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:54,965
Suns go down and may return

371
00:32:55,213 --> 00:32:57,204
But once put out
Our own brief light

372
00:32:57,413 --> 00:32:59,722
We sleep through
One eternal night."

373
00:33:00,453 --> 00:33:02,648
An intruder! A man!

374
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:07,571
Oh, it's you.

375
00:33:08,413 --> 00:33:10,449
You wanted to see me?

376
00:33:11,853 --> 00:33:14,572
I summoned you yesterday...

377
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:17,003
...to an audience in my throne room.

378
00:33:17,213 --> 00:33:19,932
I was told I was not
permitted to go there.

379
00:33:20,613 --> 00:33:24,322
It's too close to the quarters
occupied by your brother and the rest.

380
00:33:24,733 --> 00:33:28,123
I will not be told where
I can go and where I cannot go!

381
00:33:28,893 --> 00:33:30,645
Since there's nothing you want...

382
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:33,282
Except my throne!

383
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:39,206
At least you've dressed
properly for my presence.

384
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:42,005
Your best armor?

385
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:45,290
Almost, but I'm afraid
it's not being worn in your honor.

386
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:48,252
I know.

387
00:33:48,773 --> 00:33:53,164
This morning, you paid a formal
visit to the tomb of Alexander.

388
00:33:53,373 --> 00:33:56,888
You remained alone beside
the sarcophagus for some time.

389
00:33:57,613 --> 00:33:59,524
I'd like to know
how you know.

390
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:01,849
Just staring down at him.

391
00:34:03,373 --> 00:34:05,045
And then you cried.

392
00:34:06,893 --> 00:34:08,565
Why did you cry, Caesar?

393
00:34:11,173 --> 00:34:12,845
That man recites beautifully.

394
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:14,725
- Is he blind?
- Don't you hurt him.

395
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:18,249
I won't. Not anyone
who speaks Catullus so well.

396
00:34:18,453 --> 00:34:21,923
Catullus doesn't approve of you.
Why haven't you had him killed?

397
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:24,243
Because I approve of him.

398
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,771
"My desire to please you,
Caesar, is very slight

399
00:34:27,973 --> 00:34:30,885
Nor do I greatly care to know
If you are black or white."

400
00:34:31,093 --> 00:34:34,210
Achillas is moving
his entire army to Alexandria.

401
00:34:34,813 --> 00:34:38,362
By tonight, he'll outnumber you
20-to-1, 30-to-1.

402
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:42,049
He'll have the royal enclosure
entirely surrounded.

403
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:43,203
Except to the sea.

404
00:34:44,253 --> 00:34:46,483
Do you plan to sail away,
great Caesar?

405
00:34:47,773 --> 00:34:49,491
Not for the time being.

406
00:34:49,973 --> 00:34:52,851
Achillas may attack tomorrow,
the next day...

407
00:34:53,053 --> 00:34:55,487
...whenever it suits him!
- Very probable.

408
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:59,762
In your wildest dreams, Caesar,
how can you possibly hope to hold...

409
00:35:00,013 --> 00:35:02,925
...the gates of this enclosure
against such odds?

410
00:35:03,173 --> 00:35:05,846
And if you say once more,
"For the time being..."

411
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:09,443
My officers say anything
from a week to indefinitely.

412
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:11,365
What would you estimate?

413
00:35:12,773 --> 00:35:14,650
Before you're without water...

414
00:35:14,853 --> 00:35:16,081
...without food...

415
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:19,245
...your troops slaughtered,
picked off from the rooftops...

416
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:21,444
...poisoned in the brothels?

417
00:35:21,693 --> 00:35:25,652
A few days, Caesar.
At the most, a few days.

418
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,449
I'm inclined to agree with you.

419
00:35:29,693 --> 00:35:32,048
Young man, do you know this
of Catullus?

420
00:35:32,293 --> 00:35:35,171
"Give me a thousand
And a thousand kisses

421
00:35:35,373 --> 00:35:37,841
When we have many more,
We'll scramble them

422
00:35:38,093 --> 00:35:39,572
And forget the score

423
00:35:39,773 --> 00:35:42,446
So evil envy will not know
How high the count

424
00:35:42,693 --> 00:35:45,446
And cast its evil eye."

425
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:52,491
It couldn't have been
as pleasant in the throne room.

426
00:35:56,013 --> 00:35:58,971
"My desire to please you, Caesar,
Is very slight..."

427
00:35:59,213 --> 00:36:00,248
Be still!

428
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,853
Caesar, a word. It's important.

429
00:36:05,653 --> 00:36:09,612
The Egyptian galleys in the harbor
have been taking on men and armaments.

430
00:36:09,853 --> 00:36:13,641
- When will they be prepared?
- Tomorrow, with the morning wind.

431
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:16,246
Burn them tonight.

432
00:36:16,453 --> 00:36:18,250
Their ships lie close to shore.

433
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:21,451
- The fire may spread to the city.
- Let's hope it doesn't.

434
00:36:21,693 --> 00:36:23,046
I can't risk a blockade.

435
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:26,649
Remember, not before tonight.
Prepare as secretly as possible.

436
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,724
I need this day.

437
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:30,247
Good luck.

438
00:36:33,853 --> 00:36:37,243
Why not before tonight, my lord?
Why does Caesar need this day?

439
00:36:37,453 --> 00:36:40,843
I can't give you that information,
for the time being.

440
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,052
Flavius.

441
00:36:50,613 --> 00:36:53,207
Here it is, Caesar. Just arrived.

442
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:55,768
The gods shouldn't
tantalize us so, Rufio.

443
00:36:58,373 --> 00:37:00,728
It's even better than I'd hoped.

444
00:37:00,973 --> 00:37:04,682
- Be on your way, you haven't much time.
- Hail Caesar.

445
00:37:25,853 --> 00:37:30,290
It's called an epilepse because of the
arching caused by muscular spasms...

446
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:33,331
...the contortions.
The early Greeks considered...

447
00:37:33,573 --> 00:37:36,770
...those who suffered from it
to be favored by the gods.

448
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:39,564
The great Alexander, they say...

449
00:37:39,813 --> 00:37:42,043
...had this falling sickness.

450
00:37:42,253 --> 00:37:45,848
And, so they say,
the mighty Caesar too.

451
00:37:47,653 --> 00:37:50,247
Your Majesty, forgive me.
Sosigenes, the library.

452
00:37:50,493 --> 00:37:52,882
- What are you saying?
- The Romans set fire...

453
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:55,522
...to the Egyptian fleet.
- It's about time.

454
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,651
Come see for yourself.
The fire's spread to the city.

455
00:37:58,853 --> 00:38:01,128
- The city?
- Just a few buildings...

456
00:38:01,373 --> 00:38:03,250
...but the library is burning.

457
00:38:07,373 --> 00:38:09,568
The great library.

458
00:38:24,413 --> 00:38:26,529
Aristotle's manuscripts.

459
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:32,762
The Platonic commentaries,
the plays, the histories.

460
00:38:33,213 --> 00:38:35,249
The Testament of the Hebrew god.

461
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,402
The Book of Books.

462
00:38:42,813 --> 00:38:46,965
- Wind blew into the merchant shipping.
- Four burned and sank right here.

463
00:38:47,213 --> 00:38:48,851
- And our ships?
- Safe and dry.

464
00:38:49,053 --> 00:38:51,692
Prisoners are surrendering in droves.
I need help.

465
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:55,482
- Not one man. I may need your sailors.
- Halt!

466
00:38:57,093 --> 00:38:58,845
Take your hands off me!

467
00:39:05,853 --> 00:39:09,482
You should attack my guards more
often. Battle seems to become you.

468
00:39:10,173 --> 00:39:12,641
You grow more beautiful
each time I see you.

469
00:39:13,813 --> 00:39:15,769
And you grow bolder.

470
00:39:16,013 --> 00:39:16,889
And busier.

471
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:20,648
- Actually, we're extremely busy...
- Do you smell smoke?

472
00:39:22,013 --> 00:39:24,732
We found it necessary
to burn the Egyptian fleet.

473
00:39:24,973 --> 00:39:26,691
The ships were in the water.

474
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:29,891
Did you find it necessary
to burn them in the streets?

475
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:31,771
Merchant ships caught fire.

476
00:39:32,013 --> 00:39:33,924
The burning masts fell.
Some houses...

477
00:39:34,173 --> 00:39:37,848
One of them, the great
Library of Alexandria.

478
00:39:38,053 --> 00:39:40,521
Yes, I've been told.
I'm extremely sorry.

479
00:39:40,773 --> 00:39:43,446
- Now, if you don't mind, I must ask...
- I do mind.

480
00:39:43,693 --> 00:39:45,524
Are you putting the fire out?

481
00:39:45,773 --> 00:39:48,162
We're forming prisoners
into fire brigades.

482
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:52,162
Oh, I see. Romans only start fires,
is that it?

483
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:55,410
Have you left the nursery
to come irritate the adults?

484
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:57,086
Another time, we're working.

485
00:39:57,333 --> 00:40:02,123
- Shall we remove her for you, Caesar?
- Use Roman genius for destruction.

486
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,893
Tear down pyramids, wipe out cities!

487
00:40:05,133 --> 00:40:10,332
How dare you and the rest of your
barbarians set fire to my library?

488
00:40:10,693 --> 00:40:13,605
Play conqueror all you want,
mighty Caesar.

489
00:40:14,053 --> 00:40:17,932
Rape, murder, pillage thousands,
millions of human beings.

490
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:21,489
But neither you nor
any other barbarian...

491
00:40:21,693 --> 00:40:24,287
...has the right to destroy
one human thought!

492
00:40:24,693 --> 00:40:28,129
Enough!
Leave me alone with her.

493
00:40:30,973 --> 00:40:33,806
I will send for you when I finish.
It won't be long.

494
00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:41,246
Swords? Javelins?

495
00:40:41,453 --> 00:40:43,444
Or are you going to set me on fire?

496
00:40:43,653 --> 00:40:46,690
The time has come for us
to understand each other.

497
00:40:46,933 --> 00:40:50,721
Whatever else I may be, in your
opinion, first of all, I am Caesar.

498
00:40:50,973 --> 00:40:53,441
And I am Cleopatra,
queen, daughter of Isis!

499
00:40:53,693 --> 00:40:57,766
If I say so and when I say so,
you are what I say you are...

500
00:40:58,013 --> 00:40:59,492
...nothing more.

501
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:01,849
Hail Caesar!

502
00:41:03,893 --> 00:41:09,092
You, descendant of inbred generations
of incestuous mental defectives...

503
00:41:09,293 --> 00:41:11,853
...how dare you call me barbarian.
- Barbarian!

504
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:15,125
Daughter of a drunkard who
bribed his way to the throne.

505
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:19,332
- Your price was too high, remember?
- I've had enough of you pretenders...

506
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:23,248
...parading on ruins of past glories.
- Only the future concerns me.

507
00:41:23,453 --> 00:41:26,889
- Keep out of my affairs, do as I say.
- Do as you say?

508
00:41:27,133 --> 00:41:27,963
Literally?

509
00:41:28,213 --> 00:41:30,522
As if I were something
you had conquered?

510
00:41:30,893 --> 00:41:33,407
If I choose to regard you as such.

511
00:41:34,933 --> 00:41:38,528
Am I to understand that you're free
to do with me whatever you want...

512
00:41:39,253 --> 00:41:40,368
...whenever you want?

513
00:41:40,773 --> 00:41:43,446
Yes, I want that understood.

514
00:41:47,853 --> 00:41:50,208
Won't you at least wear
your laurel wreath...

515
00:41:50,453 --> 00:41:54,605
...so I can be reminded it's
the divine Caesar that honors me so?

516
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:57,045
You talk too much.

517
00:41:59,213 --> 00:42:01,044
I promise you...

518
00:42:01,453 --> 00:42:03,330
...you won't like me this way.

519
00:42:05,653 --> 00:42:08,645
Caesar! An attack on the moon gate!

520
00:42:09,013 --> 00:42:11,481
The moon gate.
An attack in force!

521
00:43:16,373 --> 00:43:18,204
Those ballistas need eliminating.

522
00:43:18,413 --> 00:43:20,290
Send out a turtle.

523
00:43:22,973 --> 00:43:25,612
Form the turtle!

524
00:44:38,373 --> 00:44:40,284
Now is the time for us to attack!

525
00:44:40,493 --> 00:44:42,688
- No.
- We have a full legion in reserve.

526
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,686
We hold our positions here.

527
00:44:56,733 --> 00:44:59,645
Two hours till dawn.
We'll hold where we are.

528
00:44:59,853 --> 00:45:02,492
- And what happens at dawn?
- I thought you knew.

529
00:45:02,693 --> 00:45:04,604
The sun comes up.

530
00:45:35,813 --> 00:45:37,531
Tell the men they've won.

531
00:45:37,773 --> 00:45:40,082
Liberty and wine
for defenders of the gate.

532
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:43,962
All reserves, cavalry, every man
available, move out behind Achillas.

533
00:45:44,173 --> 00:45:47,324
- We have him in a vise.
- What is the other half?

534
00:45:47,533 --> 00:45:50,650
Rufio and the armies of Mithradates.
He went out last night.

535
00:45:50,893 --> 00:45:53,407
Mithradates? How could
he get here this fast?

536
00:45:53,653 --> 00:45:55,564
I sent him when we sailed for Egypt.

537
00:45:55,773 --> 00:46:00,324
No general in his right mind can
hold Alexandria with two legions...

538
00:46:00,533 --> 00:46:03,764
...as you and others have repeatedly
pointed out to me.

539
00:46:26,933 --> 00:46:29,288
I taste your drink,
daughter of Isis...

540
00:46:29,493 --> 00:46:33,008
...and if there be harm in it,
let the harm fall upon me.

541
00:46:38,453 --> 00:46:39,886
Lotus.

542
00:46:42,213 --> 00:46:46,445
You wiped the rim of the cup
after you tasted it. Why?

543
00:46:46,813 --> 00:46:49,930
Why? So my mouth would not soil it.

544
00:46:50,853 --> 00:46:51,649
Lotus...

545
00:46:53,093 --> 00:46:54,287
...taste it again.

546
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:07,205
Pothinus said he would have me killed.
Forgive me, Majesty.

547
00:47:07,493 --> 00:47:10,326
Forgive me. Forgive me.

548
00:47:11,253 --> 00:47:12,242
I forgive you.

549
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,002
Now drink it.

550
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:46,046
Apollodorus!

551
00:47:47,773 --> 00:47:49,445
Apollodorus!

552
00:47:54,853 --> 00:47:57,162
Great silence
for Gaius Julius Caesar...

553
00:47:57,413 --> 00:47:59,529
...senate consul of the people
of Rome.

554
00:47:59,773 --> 00:48:01,809
You will all stand.

555
00:48:24,853 --> 00:48:26,684
Let what is said be recorded...

556
00:48:26,893 --> 00:48:30,772
...as the judgment and decree
of the Senate and people of Rome.

557
00:48:32,013 --> 00:48:33,731
There is no judgment here.

558
00:48:33,933 --> 00:48:36,367
And the decree not Rome's,
but Cleopatra's.

559
00:48:37,053 --> 00:48:38,532
She has lied to you, Caesar.

560
00:48:38,733 --> 00:48:40,724
She and her slaves lie to you.

561
00:48:40,933 --> 00:48:44,721
You have not been accused, Pothinus.
Thus far.

562
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:49,484
You are now charged with inciting and
abetting war against the Roman army...

563
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:52,730
...and plotting to assassinate
Queen Cleopatra.

564
00:48:53,373 --> 00:48:56,092
You are guilty of both.
You are sentenced to death.

565
00:49:15,693 --> 00:49:18,765
It's too bright in here.
Shut out some of the sun.

566
00:49:32,293 --> 00:49:34,363
Are you going to kill me too, Caesar?

567
00:49:34,693 --> 00:49:35,842
What am I accused of?

568
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:40,812
King Ptolemy is hereby removed
from the protective custody of Rome.

569
00:49:41,093 --> 00:49:42,890
He'll leave within the hour...

570
00:49:43,133 --> 00:49:45,886
...and be conducted safely
to the camp of Achillas.

571
00:49:46,213 --> 00:49:49,410
Achillas! You're going to send me
back to my own troops?

572
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:53,612
He is to be accompanied
by his learned tutor, Theodotus.

573
00:49:53,853 --> 00:49:56,606
Do you hear that?
You'll be saved along with me.

574
00:49:56,853 --> 00:49:59,128
Stop grinning, you little idiot.

575
00:49:59,373 --> 00:50:03,924
May I speak?
You know that Achillas is trapped...

576
00:50:04,173 --> 00:50:07,245
...between your own legions
and the armies of Mithradates.

577
00:50:07,453 --> 00:50:10,604
To send His Majesty to fight
may mean his death.

578
00:50:10,813 --> 00:50:13,247
An occupational hazard
for those who are king.

579
00:50:13,493 --> 00:50:15,643
But then certainly not I, Caesar.

580
00:50:15,853 --> 00:50:17,923
I'm no king, nor general.
What do I know of war?

581
00:50:18,133 --> 00:50:20,089
A simple scholar.

582
00:50:20,293 --> 00:50:22,443
A man of thoughts and words.

583
00:50:22,693 --> 00:50:25,651
Too many words. Enough.

584
00:50:25,893 --> 00:50:27,884
Let all be done properly as decreed.

585
00:50:51,253 --> 00:50:53,005
Flavius.

586
00:50:54,813 --> 00:50:57,327
Find Apollodorus.
Return his dagger to him.

587
00:50:57,573 --> 00:51:01,202
You might clean it first.
It has Pothinus all over it.

588
00:51:02,053 --> 00:51:05,409
Yes, yes, I know I'm tired.
I promise I'll sleep.

589
00:51:07,293 --> 00:51:11,650
You have my apologies
for what almost happened to you.

590
00:51:11,893 --> 00:51:15,806
Caesar, will you talk with me
for just a minute?

591
00:51:16,213 --> 00:51:18,283
Yesterday was full.
Tonight was long.

592
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,683
This morning has not been uneventful.

593
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:23,925
Did you know that Apollodorus
would kill Pothinus?

594
00:51:24,533 --> 00:51:28,048
He was kind enough to wait until Rome
had passed sentence of death.

595
00:51:28,813 --> 00:51:30,610
And my brother...

596
00:51:30,813 --> 00:51:32,212
...and Theodotus?

597
00:51:32,453 --> 00:51:34,444
They too will be killed, possibly.

598
00:51:34,653 --> 00:51:36,405
Probably.

599
00:51:36,853 --> 00:51:38,764
Your Majesty, I'm truly weary.

600
00:51:39,453 --> 00:51:43,048
You knew all along, didn't you,
that there was no real danger.

601
00:51:43,293 --> 00:51:46,330
That Mithradates was on his way
to reinforce you.

602
00:51:46,573 --> 00:51:49,883
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You wouldn't believe me.

603
00:51:50,093 --> 00:51:52,812
- I really must insist...
- I would've believed you.

604
00:51:53,013 --> 00:51:55,573
- You didn't trust me.
- Not for an instant.

605
00:51:56,293 --> 00:51:58,284
And yet, in these last few minutes...

606
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:01,411
...you have made me undisputed queen.

607
00:52:01,613 --> 00:52:04,002
The sole ruler of Egypt. Why?

608
00:52:04,213 --> 00:52:06,807
Perhaps tomorrow we could talk.

609
00:52:07,013 --> 00:52:09,049
- Why, Caesar?
- It was best for Rome!

610
00:52:09,253 --> 00:52:11,608
- Best for Egypt.
- For Egypt too.

611
00:52:11,853 --> 00:52:14,413
Cleopatra, get out.
I beg of you, get out.

612
00:52:38,933 --> 00:52:40,889
That will not be needed.

613
00:52:41,293 --> 00:52:44,410
It wasn't necessary
for me to betray myself.

614
00:52:44,653 --> 00:52:46,530
I could have
called out for Flavius.

615
00:52:46,773 --> 00:52:49,571
How many new spy-holes
have you dug in the walls?

616
00:52:49,773 --> 00:52:52,207
Are we being watched
even now?

617
00:52:53,053 --> 00:52:56,011
If you see Flavius,
you might send him to me.

618
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:59,885
- Still trying to dismiss me?
- What is it you want?

619
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:03,608
- What more do you want?
- To be of help to you.

620
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:07,010
There never has been help.
There never will be.

621
00:53:11,253 --> 00:53:13,209
Now there is.

622
00:53:13,613 --> 00:53:16,047
One day it'll happen
where I cannot hide.

623
00:53:16,253 --> 00:53:18,721
Where the world will see me fall.

624
00:53:18,933 --> 00:53:21,367
I shall tumble down before the mob...

625
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:24,007
...and foam at the mouth
and make them laugh.

626
00:53:24,253 --> 00:53:26,244
And they'll tear me to pieces.

627
00:53:26,493 --> 00:53:29,485
The gods themselves had your sickness.

628
00:53:29,693 --> 00:53:33,368
Hannibal, even the great Alexander.

629
00:53:33,573 --> 00:53:35,564
And in the end, they fell.

630
00:53:35,773 --> 00:53:38,003
Were torn to pieces by the mob.

631
00:53:39,373 --> 00:53:41,011
Not you.

632
00:53:41,773 --> 00:53:44,207
I will see to that.

633
00:54:00,093 --> 00:54:04,723
In the name of the Senate and the
people of Rome and by their will.

634
00:54:34,573 --> 00:54:39,089
Isis herself would surrender her place
in heaven to be as beautiful as you.

635
00:54:39,293 --> 00:54:42,922
You're not supposed
to look at me. No one is.

636
00:54:43,173 --> 00:54:46,006
If they aren't looking,
how do they know I am?

637
00:54:47,133 --> 00:54:49,010
You should be kneeling.

638
00:54:49,213 --> 00:54:53,001
Would that do
before all these visiting kings?

639
00:54:53,613 --> 00:54:56,810
Making believe
they're not watching us?

640
00:55:00,293 --> 00:55:03,649
You have such bony knees.

641
00:55:03,893 --> 00:55:07,806
Not only bony, but unaccustomed
to this sort of thing.

642
00:55:53,733 --> 00:55:56,008
If we're to get an early start
in the morning...

643
00:55:56,213 --> 00:55:58,010
What will it be tomorrow?

644
00:55:58,253 --> 00:55:59,686
More wheat?

645
00:55:59,933 --> 00:56:03,323
What I've seen could feed
more legions than Rome ever had.

646
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:05,404
There's enough to feed the world.

647
00:56:05,613 --> 00:56:07,126
More gold then.

648
00:56:07,373 --> 00:56:09,887
Why not buy the world?
Surely you have enough.

649
00:56:10,693 --> 00:56:14,208
At least enough to pay more legions
than even Rome has ever had.

650
00:56:14,453 --> 00:56:16,364
More granite, more marble...

651
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:19,804
...more millions of slaves
to build whatever needs building.

652
00:56:20,053 --> 00:56:22,851
Better routes to India,
shorter routes to the East.

653
00:56:23,053 --> 00:56:25,806
What can there be in Egypt
that I haven't seen?

654
00:56:26,013 --> 00:56:29,085
Egypt itself. The reason for Egypt.

655
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:32,009
My responsibility is Rome.

656
00:56:33,093 --> 00:56:35,323
Alexander understood it...

657
00:56:35,573 --> 00:56:38,610
...that from Egypt
he could rule the world.

658
00:56:39,773 --> 00:56:43,049
He was very young.
And you, even younger.

659
00:56:43,293 --> 00:56:47,730
At your age, such dreams have a
reality which grows less in time.

660
00:56:49,053 --> 00:56:51,044
Caesar no longer dreams?

661
00:56:51,653 --> 00:56:53,723
Dangerous to a man of my calling.

662
00:56:55,013 --> 00:56:57,208
Necessary, I would have thought.

663
00:57:13,253 --> 00:57:16,563
I can't stay away from Rome too long.
There are problems.

664
00:57:16,773 --> 00:57:19,685
Messages from Marc Antony
endlessly demanding my return.

665
00:57:19,893 --> 00:57:23,806
And on my way back, wars
to be fought in the east and north.

666
00:57:24,053 --> 00:57:27,443
Even in Rome itself
I'm not without opposition.

667
00:57:27,693 --> 00:57:30,207
Do to them
what you did to Achillas.

668
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:32,608
This is opposition
of a different sort.

669
00:57:32,813 --> 00:57:35,327
They weave it cleverly, lightly,
like a cobweb.

670
00:57:35,573 --> 00:57:39,407
You know what happens when cobwebs
are not regularly swept away.

671
00:57:39,613 --> 00:57:42,525
Do you trust this Marc Antony?

672
00:57:43,813 --> 00:57:46,566
If anyone in the world,
I trust Antony.

673
00:57:46,973 --> 00:57:51,012
Let him brush away the cobwebs
for you and stay with me.

674
00:57:51,253 --> 00:57:53,528
You've been declared
dictator for a year.

675
00:57:53,773 --> 00:57:55,809
You can do what you want
with your time.

676
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:59,446
Everything but make it stand still.

677
00:58:00,653 --> 00:58:03,247
If... When you return to Rome...

678
00:58:03,493 --> 00:58:07,088
...these wars that have to be fought
on the way, are they important?

679
00:58:07,293 --> 00:58:11,002
Well, there's no such thing
as an unimportant war.

680
00:58:11,213 --> 00:58:15,206
I've been reading in your commentaries
about your campaigns in Gaul.

681
00:58:15,413 --> 00:58:17,768
How does my writing
compare with Catullus?

682
00:58:19,053 --> 00:58:21,044
Well, it's different.

683
00:58:21,293 --> 00:58:22,806
Dull.

684
00:58:23,213 --> 00:58:25,488
Perhaps a little
too much description.

685
00:58:25,733 --> 00:58:29,043
You're being tactful.
Some of my critics, Brutus, for one...

686
00:58:29,293 --> 00:58:33,002
...tell me my Latin is not only
ungrammatical, but common.

687
00:58:33,733 --> 00:58:36,805
You spared his life more than once.

688
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:40,005
People say it's because
Brutus is your son.

689
00:58:40,213 --> 00:58:41,566
Is that true?

690
00:58:42,253 --> 00:58:44,403
I have no son.

691
00:58:44,613 --> 00:58:47,252
- Calpurnia, your third wife...
- Fourth.

692
00:58:47,453 --> 00:58:51,207
...married to you how long?
12 years?

693
00:58:51,493 --> 00:58:54,883
And still, Caesar has no son,
no child at all.

694
00:58:55,133 --> 00:58:58,205
It is well-known that
Calpurnia is barren.

695
00:58:58,453 --> 00:59:01,172
A woman who cannot bear children...

696
00:59:01,373 --> 00:59:04,445
...is like a river that is dry.

697
00:59:04,693 --> 00:59:07,810
I see no purpose in discussing
the subject further.

698
00:59:08,493 --> 00:59:12,930
A woman, too, must make
the barren land fruitful.

699
00:59:13,173 --> 00:59:17,052
She must make life grow
where there was no life.

700
00:59:17,293 --> 00:59:22,208
Just as the Mother Nile feeds
and replenishes the earth.

701
00:59:23,973 --> 00:59:26,009
I am the Nile.

702
00:59:29,293 --> 00:59:32,012
I will bear many sons.

703
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:34,609
Isis has told me.

704
00:59:36,453 --> 00:59:40,412
My breasts are filled
with love and life.

705
00:59:41,093 --> 00:59:44,403
My hips are rounded
and well apart.

706
00:59:45,453 --> 00:59:47,603
Such women, they say...

707
00:59:47,853 --> 00:59:49,809
...have sons.

708
01:00:11,613 --> 01:00:14,685
That first time
when you stood here alone...

709
01:00:15,693 --> 01:00:18,412
...why did you cry?
Will you tell me now?

710
01:00:18,653 --> 01:00:21,042
Because I had lost something.

711
01:00:21,293 --> 01:00:23,648
- What?
- A lifetime.

712
01:00:23,893 --> 01:00:26,043
- Mine.
- Nonsense.

713
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:29,729
Having conquered the world,
he died at 32.

714
01:00:29,933 --> 01:00:31,889
I am 52.

715
01:00:32,133 --> 01:00:35,443
My remaining ambition is to keep
the world from conquering me.

716
01:00:38,653 --> 01:00:42,009
Your ambitions
must always have been his.

717
01:00:42,493 --> 01:00:44,245
They still must be.

718
01:00:44,493 --> 01:00:49,169
Shall I tell you something?
When I was 32 in Spain...

719
01:00:49,373 --> 01:00:52,251
...I came upon a statue of Alexander.

720
01:00:52,493 --> 01:00:54,449
I wept then too.

721
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:56,251
Even then.

722
01:00:56,893 --> 01:01:00,090
I want you to have his sword
to take back with you.

723
01:01:00,333 --> 01:01:02,403
- Too deeply embedded.
- It can be removed.

724
01:01:02,613 --> 01:01:04,444
It's buried in time.

725
01:01:04,693 --> 01:01:07,890
- And Alexander's mantle?
- Too heavy for Caesar.

726
01:01:10,693 --> 01:01:12,411
His dream then.

727
01:01:13,613 --> 01:01:16,411
Make his dream yours, Caesar.

728
01:01:16,653 --> 01:01:19,213
His grand design.

729
01:01:19,933 --> 01:01:22,527
Pick it up where he left off.

730
01:01:23,893 --> 01:01:27,203
Out of the patchwork of conquests...

731
01:01:27,413 --> 01:01:29,210
...one world.

732
01:01:29,453 --> 01:01:32,604
And out of one world, one nation.

733
01:01:32,853 --> 01:01:37,051
One people on earth living in peace.

734
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:40,490
So you have told me at last
what it is you want of me.

735
01:01:40,733 --> 01:01:42,007
Of us!

736
01:01:42,253 --> 01:01:45,802
At the center, the capital of this
world, one people, one nation...

737
01:01:46,013 --> 01:01:47,128
...Alexandria?

738
01:01:47,373 --> 01:01:48,931
- He chose it.
- I am Roman.

739
01:01:49,173 --> 01:01:52,802
He was Greek! What will it matter
when we're all one people?

740
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:55,652
I am 52. He was 32 and failed.

741
01:01:55,893 --> 01:01:57,611
We will succeed.

742
01:01:57,853 --> 01:02:01,402
Your dreams, your ambitions.

743
01:02:01,653 --> 01:02:05,612
One lifetime is not enough
for such dreams, such ambitions.

744
01:02:06,533 --> 01:02:09,093
The cloak of Alexander
cannot be too heavy...

745
01:02:09,293 --> 01:02:12,649
...for Rome and Egypt
to carry together.

746
01:02:12,893 --> 01:02:16,727
And what if his sword
is too deeply embedded?

747
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:19,322
Yours will replace it, Caesar.

748
01:02:19,573 --> 01:02:22,406
You have a way of mixing
politics and passion.

749
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:25,002
Where does one begin
and the other leave off?

750
01:02:25,253 --> 01:02:29,007
That did not start,
nor will it end with me.

751
01:02:29,293 --> 01:02:33,002
Cleopatra, whatever it is,
however it comes out...

752
01:02:33,253 --> 01:02:35,209
...leave me my destiny.

753
01:02:35,973 --> 01:02:40,125
Your destiny
is no longer just yours.

754
01:02:40,373 --> 01:02:42,204
It's mine too.

755
01:02:42,893 --> 01:02:47,489
Soon, there will be someone to
carry both the cloak of Alexander...

756
01:02:47,733 --> 01:02:50,850
...and the sword of Caesar...

757
01:02:51,093 --> 01:02:53,084
...and the name of Caesar.

758
01:02:54,293 --> 01:02:57,683
And in that name he will rule Egypt.

759
01:02:57,893 --> 01:03:02,250
And whatever part or all
of the world that we give him...

760
01:03:02,493 --> 01:03:05,212
...our child...

761
01:03:05,413 --> 01:03:09,201
...will be a son for you, Caesar.

762
01:03:10,493 --> 01:03:12,961
By Isis, I swear it.

763
01:03:18,893 --> 01:03:21,805
Could you put off
your return to Rome...

764
01:03:22,253 --> 01:03:24,084
...just long enough?

765
01:03:50,841 --> 01:03:52,274
I came as quickly as I could.

766
01:03:52,521 --> 01:03:57,436
Antony is welcome to Caesar's house
as often and as quickly as he likes.

767
01:03:57,721 --> 01:04:01,031
As Caesar's wife, before truth
is distorted into vicious gossip...

768
01:04:01,241 --> 01:04:05,234
...I wanted you to hear...
- That my husband has married Cleopatra.

769
01:04:07,121 --> 01:04:10,830
There's some fresh wine.
One of your many favorites.

770
01:04:12,801 --> 01:04:16,680
The ceremony, according to vicious
gossip, was in the Egyptian religion.

771
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:19,435
Even if true, that can't be
taken seriously.

772
01:04:19,641 --> 01:04:23,031
During which he was formally
declared an Egyptian god.

773
01:04:23,481 --> 01:04:25,836
Officially divine, at last.

774
01:04:26,441 --> 01:04:28,477
That must have pleased Caesar.

775
01:04:28,721 --> 01:04:32,077
Calpurnia, we know Caesar, you and I.

776
01:04:32,321 --> 01:04:35,393
This so-called marriage
has no validity under Roman law.

777
01:04:35,601 --> 01:04:37,557
There must be political purpose.

778
01:04:37,801 --> 01:04:40,873
Perhaps a symbolic ceremony
to ratify our bond with Egypt.

779
01:04:41,121 --> 01:04:44,272
Perhaps merely
indulging some barbaric custom.

780
01:04:44,521 --> 01:04:46,591
You've been loyal and kind.

781
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:49,235
You came as quickly
as you could.

782
01:04:49,601 --> 01:04:53,150
Unhappily, vicious gossip
travels even faster than you...

783
01:04:53,361 --> 01:04:55,033
...and the truth.

784
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:59,839
Have you heard, for instance, that
Cleopatra is carrying Caesar's child?

785
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:03,837
Yes, Antony.

786
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:05,838
We know him...

787
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:08,032
...you and I.

788
01:05:31,521 --> 01:05:33,318
There shall be...

789
01:05:33,561 --> 01:05:35,313
There shall be...

790
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:37,358
...Rome.

791
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:39,831
Mighty and alone and unloved.

792
01:05:40,081 --> 01:05:41,912
A mistress.

793
01:05:42,161 --> 01:05:45,471
A mistress shall raise thee again
from earth to heaven...

794
01:05:45,721 --> 01:05:50,636
...and all the world shall know
a golden age of justice and of love.

795
01:05:52,201 --> 01:05:54,431
A son shall be born to Isis!

796
01:05:55,721 --> 01:05:58,360
A son shall be born to Isis!

797
01:05:58,601 --> 01:06:01,069
Rome shall know him in cloth of gold.

798
01:06:01,321 --> 01:06:05,439
The East shall see him laden
with jewels and treasure.

799
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:08,753
A son of Egypt and of Rome!

800
01:06:13,321 --> 01:06:17,234
Here shall he find his destiny!

801
01:06:48,521 --> 01:06:51,240
Do exactly as I tell you.

802
01:06:51,601 --> 01:06:53,831
When the child is born...

803
01:06:54,081 --> 01:06:57,551
...after he is anointed
and named royal prince...

804
01:06:57,801 --> 01:06:59,473
...take him to Caesar.

805
01:06:59,721 --> 01:07:00,915
Bring Caesar here.

806
01:07:01,161 --> 01:07:05,234
No. Exactly as I tell you.

807
01:07:05,481 --> 01:07:09,190
Take the child to Caesar,
in front of his men.

808
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:11,232
Do you understand?

809
01:07:11,521 --> 01:07:14,035
In front of all the Romans.

810
01:07:15,801 --> 01:07:18,759
Lay him at Caesar's feet.

811
01:07:18,961 --> 01:07:21,680
At Caesar's feet.

812
01:07:21,921 --> 01:07:24,037
I will do just as you say.

813
01:07:41,761 --> 01:07:43,752
Fear not.
We have never lost a Caesar.

814
01:07:44,001 --> 01:07:47,437
That remark was insubordinate
and in bad taste!

815
01:07:55,521 --> 01:07:57,477
Caesar, remember Roman law.

816
01:07:57,721 --> 01:08:00,474
If you pick up this child
you acknowledge it's yours...

817
01:08:00,721 --> 01:08:03,110
...and a citizen of Rome,
as your heir.

818
01:08:27,241 --> 01:08:29,232
A son.

819
01:08:32,521 --> 01:08:34,751
I have a son!

820
01:08:34,961 --> 01:08:37,634
- Hail Caesar!
- Hail Caesar!

821
01:08:43,961 --> 01:08:45,633
He's been made king of Egypt.

822
01:08:45,881 --> 01:08:48,441
They have named their bastard
Caesarion.

823
01:08:48,641 --> 01:08:50,074
Prince Caesarion.

824
01:08:50,321 --> 01:08:53,233
What better name for the heir
to the throne of Rome.

825
01:08:53,481 --> 01:08:55,039
There is no throne of Rome.

826
01:08:55,281 --> 01:08:58,034
Nor shall there be,
nor would Caesar tolerate one.

827
01:08:58,281 --> 01:08:59,760
But a son!

828
01:09:00,001 --> 01:09:03,232
We know how much he's wanted one.
I am happy for Caesar.

829
01:09:03,921 --> 01:09:06,435
Your happiness
is understandable enough.

830
01:09:06,641 --> 01:09:09,314
Now that Caesar has
publicly recognized a son...

831
01:09:09,521 --> 01:09:12,160
...one need no longer
wonder about Brutus.

832
01:09:12,401 --> 01:09:14,869
Is it a relief not to be
wondered about, Casca?

833
01:09:15,121 --> 01:09:17,760
To be known openly
as you are for what you are:

834
01:09:18,001 --> 01:09:20,071
Liar, swindler, bully and coward.

835
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:23,273
Brutus, you'll turn Casca's head
with your flattery.

836
01:09:23,481 --> 01:09:27,030
And Casca's head, if turned,
will see Marc Antony.

837
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:31,072
A part of Caesar more to be feared
than his infant son.

838
01:09:32,441 --> 01:09:36,514
But it is for the good of Rome that
Caesar has stayed so long in Egypt.

839
01:09:36,761 --> 01:09:39,833
In his absence, the people
have come to worship him as a god.

840
01:09:40,041 --> 01:09:43,238
Why should he return to show himself
as mortal as the rest?

841
01:09:43,481 --> 01:09:46,439
There are those
who fear Caesar's ambition.

842
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:49,713
But what is to fear?
That he will destroy the republic?

843
01:09:49,961 --> 01:09:52,236
Yes, he will.

844
01:09:52,441 --> 01:09:54,238
I promise you he will.

845
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:56,909
Your tongue is old but sharp, Cicero.

846
01:09:57,121 --> 01:10:00,033
Be careful how you waggle it.
It may cut off your head.

847
01:10:00,241 --> 01:10:02,516
It will more likely
be your sword, Antony.

848
01:10:02,761 --> 01:10:05,434
'Tis just as sharp and quicker...

849
01:10:05,681 --> 01:10:07,831
...and frightened of heads.

850
01:10:09,641 --> 01:10:12,872
There'll be a strong smell
of wine in the Senate today.

851
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:15,032
We must breathe with restraint.

852
01:10:20,281 --> 01:10:24,240
Octavian, this what's his name,
this son of Caesar...

853
01:10:24,441 --> 01:10:26,079
...does it upset you?

854
01:10:26,321 --> 01:10:27,754
No.

855
01:10:28,001 --> 01:10:29,639
You run off at the mouth so...

856
01:10:29,881 --> 01:10:32,679
...one thinks your words
are as precious as your gold.

857
01:10:32,921 --> 01:10:36,630
Like my gold, I use them
where they are worth most.

858
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:41,235
And your virtue?
My friend has a friend.

859
01:10:41,761 --> 01:10:43,638
That too.

860
01:10:44,081 --> 01:10:47,756
You know, it's quite possible
that when you die...

861
01:10:47,961 --> 01:10:51,431
...you will die without
ever having been alive.

862
01:11:24,721 --> 01:11:28,760
I can't leave without saying
goodbye to my son and to you.

863
01:11:29,001 --> 01:11:32,789
We thought, your son and I,
that if we came to you...

864
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:35,913
...we would have those
few minutes more.

865
01:11:40,641 --> 01:11:43,030
A good thing to remember, my son...

866
01:11:43,481 --> 01:11:46,393
...what you will not let go,
no one will take from you.

867
01:11:49,721 --> 01:11:52,440
Hail and farewell, little Caesar.

868
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:10,831
Was it a century ago when I was dropped
at your feet, wrapped in a carpet?

869
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:14,911
Or was it last night?

870
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:28,357
When will you send for us? When?

871
01:12:28,561 --> 01:12:31,837
- Soon.
- How soon? When?

872
01:12:32,041 --> 01:12:34,839
So much time must go by
before even I reach Rome.

873
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:37,271
And then how soon?

874
01:12:37,481 --> 01:12:39,551
Within reasonable time.

875
01:12:39,761 --> 01:12:41,717
Time is never reasonable.

876
01:12:41,921 --> 01:12:43,673
Time is our enemy, Caesar.

877
01:12:43,881 --> 01:12:47,874
Am I to conquer it for you?
What plan of battle do you suggest?

878
01:12:48,961 --> 01:12:51,429
I must bring your son to Rome.

879
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:54,834
Rome must see Caesar's son...

880
01:12:55,601 --> 01:12:58,638
...who will one day rule
over Caesar's world.

881
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:00,640
Caesar?

882
01:13:02,281 --> 01:13:05,034
I'm afraid the tides
will soon be against you.

883
01:13:21,001 --> 01:13:23,720
Not only time, but the tides.

884
01:13:23,921 --> 01:13:27,436
Even as divinities, there seems
little we can do about either.

885
01:13:42,361 --> 01:13:44,511
<i>But only after more than two years...</i>

886
01:13:44,721 --> 01:13:48,191
<i>... and many wars</i>
<i>in Africa and Asia Minor...</i>

887
01:13:48,401 --> 01:13:52,553
<i>... was Caesar able to cross over</i>
<i>to Italy and come home at last...</i>

888
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:57,277
<i>... to celebrate his triumphs</i>
<i>and see to his affairs.</i>

889
01:14:17,841 --> 01:14:20,833
"In recognition, the Senate
has bestowed upon Caesar...

890
01:14:21,081 --> 01:14:25,916
...the rank, privilege and title
of dictator of Rome for life."

891
01:14:26,121 --> 01:14:28,157
Dictator for life!

892
01:14:28,361 --> 01:14:31,319
At long last, he is master of Rome.

893
01:14:31,521 --> 01:14:34,513
Apollodorus,
everything must be made ready at once.

894
01:14:34,721 --> 01:14:36,916
- Ships, servants...
- We are prepared.

895
01:14:37,121 --> 01:14:40,113
Surely now nothing
can prevent his sending for us...

896
01:14:40,321 --> 01:14:43,074
...if only to attend
his coronation as he did mine.

897
01:14:43,281 --> 01:14:46,398
- Your Majesty...
- Three long, wasted years!

898
01:14:46,601 --> 01:14:48,956
Why should the Senate
have taken so long...

899
01:14:49,161 --> 01:14:51,834
...to recognize what the world
has already known?

900
01:14:52,041 --> 01:14:55,113
That Caesar was master of Rome.

901
01:14:55,641 --> 01:14:58,030
Rufio wishes to speak.

902
01:14:58,241 --> 01:15:00,197
Your Majesty seems to misunderstand.

903
01:15:00,401 --> 01:15:04,997
It seems quite clear. Caesar has been
declared dictator of Rome for life.

904
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:10,116
True. But there is a vast difference
between dictator and master.

905
01:15:10,561 --> 01:15:12,552
No man can call himself
master of Rome.

906
01:15:12,761 --> 01:15:14,479
Why not?

907
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:18,310
It has a meaning far too close
to a word no Roman will tolerate:

908
01:15:18,521 --> 01:15:19,920
King.

909
01:15:26,801 --> 01:15:29,599
And to be dictator of Rome for life?

910
01:15:29,801 --> 01:15:34,033
Is to be granted the lifelong respect
and honor of the Roman people.

911
01:15:34,241 --> 01:15:37,119
And the dictates of the dictator?

912
01:15:37,321 --> 01:15:41,519
Must in each case, of course,
be approved by the Senate of Rome.

913
01:15:43,321 --> 01:15:45,118
Thank you, Rufio.

914
01:15:51,801 --> 01:15:54,190
The enemy! The enemy! The enemy!

915
01:16:06,281 --> 01:16:07,919
Sosigenes.

916
01:16:10,361 --> 01:16:14,832
You must think it odd that I propose
an invitation to Queen Cleopatra.

917
01:16:15,041 --> 01:16:16,315
Do you?

918
01:16:16,561 --> 01:16:20,110
Egypt, after all, has been
officially declared ally of Rome.

919
01:16:20,361 --> 01:16:24,240
Still, I confess I was surprised
at some of those who voted in favor.

920
01:16:24,481 --> 01:16:25,550
Were you?

921
01:16:25,761 --> 01:16:30,471
May I express my gratitude for being
permitted to visit today's session?

922
01:16:30,681 --> 01:16:32,399
It was truly inspiring...

923
01:16:32,601 --> 01:16:36,560
...to witness the free will
of free men so fearlessly expressed.

924
01:16:38,401 --> 01:16:40,437
He seemed most anxious to be present.

925
01:16:40,641 --> 01:16:43,439
- I saw no harm in granting permission.
- Didn't you?

926
01:16:43,681 --> 01:16:48,596
After today, never again shall I
doubt the extent of Egypt's wealth.

927
01:16:48,841 --> 01:16:50,752
I don't like Cicero's implication.

928
01:16:51,001 --> 01:16:54,550
There's not enough gold in Egypt
to buy a Roman senator.

929
01:16:54,761 --> 01:16:58,515
More than enough, it seems,
to buy his vote.

930
01:17:00,841 --> 01:17:02,672
How was it now?

931
01:17:02,881 --> 01:17:07,113
"Rome will know him in cloth of gold."

932
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:28,916
By reports, the reception
in the streets is extraordinary.

933
01:17:29,121 --> 01:17:32,318
The queen has instructed
the procession to move slowly...

934
01:17:32,561 --> 01:17:34,756
...for the people's enjoyment.

935
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:39,791
I might almost believe Cleopatra set
out to capture the citizens of Rome.

936
01:17:40,001 --> 01:17:43,311
One would have every reason
for believing exactly that.

937
01:22:56,601 --> 01:23:00,310
Nothing like this has come
into Rome since Romulus and Remus.

938
01:23:52,121 --> 01:23:54,510
How unafraid he is.

939
01:23:54,881 --> 01:23:57,315
How unafraid he is.

940
01:26:00,001 --> 01:26:02,640
Your queen has conquered
the people of Rome.

941
01:26:02,841 --> 01:26:05,196
The people, yes.

942
01:26:16,641 --> 01:26:19,792
Now then, walk like a king.
Head up.

943
01:26:20,001 --> 01:26:21,753
Listen to them cheer.

944
01:26:21,961 --> 01:26:23,713
Take your throne.

945
01:26:23,921 --> 01:26:26,230
Bow to the right, left.

946
01:26:26,441 --> 01:26:29,513
Now an angry glance at someone
who's displeased you.

947
01:26:30,641 --> 01:26:33,792
Very good. I tremble.
See me tremble?

948
01:26:34,881 --> 01:26:36,553
No, don't smile.

949
01:26:36,801 --> 01:26:39,361
Not when they're trembling.
It makes them stop.

950
01:26:39,601 --> 01:26:42,638
Now the prisoners
are dragged before you, one by one.

951
01:26:42,881 --> 01:26:46,032
This one has no power anywhere,
therefore means nothing.

952
01:26:46,281 --> 01:26:50,354
But you wish to be known
as a noble ruler. What do you say?

953
01:26:51,121 --> 01:26:53,396
"I pardon you."

954
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:56,599
Louder. You pardon somebody,
you want it known.

955
01:26:56,841 --> 01:27:00,117
"I pardon you!"

956
01:27:02,641 --> 01:27:04,359
Ah, now, who comes here?

957
01:27:04,601 --> 01:27:08,833
Once your friend. You trusted him,
and he turned against you.

958
01:27:09,081 --> 01:27:11,151
He has power, wealth and family.

959
01:27:11,401 --> 01:27:14,393
He kneels.
He begs you to be his friend again.

960
01:27:14,601 --> 01:27:16,512
To have you trust him again.

961
01:27:16,721 --> 01:27:19,110
And then? What then, little king?

962
01:27:27,641 --> 01:27:30,872
Caesar must wish
what needs commanding.

963
01:27:31,081 --> 01:27:34,118
To drain the Pontine Marshes.
To free Rome from malaria.

964
01:27:34,321 --> 01:27:35,993
To fill my belly.

965
01:27:36,241 --> 01:27:38,709
To control the Tiber's floods.

966
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:42,630
To improve the harbor at Ostia.
To please my ambition.

967
01:27:42,881 --> 01:27:46,351
And must I wish roads to be built,
libraries for public use?

968
01:27:46,601 --> 01:27:49,399
The men of Italy to be equal
to those of Rome?

969
01:27:49,601 --> 01:27:52,399
Many of these have merits
and merit our approval.

970
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:56,640
"Merit your approval." Is Caesar
to come before the Senate each day...

971
01:27:56,881 --> 01:27:59,793
...like a schoolboy,
now passing, now failing?

972
01:28:00,001 --> 01:28:03,835
Do you suggest the Senate no longer
deliberate the welfare of Rome?

973
01:28:04,041 --> 01:28:06,032
To end the process of Roman law?

974
01:28:06,241 --> 01:28:10,519
I must be the law! And my word
must be the welfare of Rome.

975
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:16,112
Else, take from me
this meaningless title of dictator.

976
01:28:16,841 --> 01:28:18,911
I've carried a sword for too long.

977
01:28:19,161 --> 01:28:22,312
I cannot now pretend
with an empty scabbard.

978
01:28:24,401 --> 01:28:27,677
Surely Caesar recalls the symbolic
nature of the title "dictator"...

979
01:28:27,881 --> 01:28:29,712
...at the time it was conferred.

980
01:28:29,921 --> 01:28:32,151
It was to honor Caesar
above all men...

981
01:28:32,401 --> 01:28:35,950
...and to indicate Rome's gratitude
for your triumphs in its name.

982
01:28:36,961 --> 01:28:40,920
Brutus, I recall them well,
those triumphs.

983
01:28:41,121 --> 01:28:42,600
Do you?

984
01:28:42,841 --> 01:28:45,674
Pharsalia, for one.
You trembled in Antony's hand...

985
01:28:45,881 --> 01:28:48,759
...when he was hot
to separate you from your head...

986
01:28:49,001 --> 01:28:50,354
...with just cause.

987
01:28:51,161 --> 01:28:53,152
My command spared your life.

988
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:56,751
There was no deliberating body.
It was not my wish, but my command.

989
01:28:56,961 --> 01:29:01,239
By my dictate that you stand here
dribbling virtue out of your mouth.

990
01:29:01,441 --> 01:29:02,920
Sit down.

991
01:29:03,881 --> 01:29:07,635
No, I want no more meaningless
privileges and considerations.

992
01:29:07,841 --> 01:29:10,594
No more honors designed to pacify me.

993
01:29:10,801 --> 01:29:13,838
I would rather have nothing.
Remain what I am at heart.

994
01:29:14,041 --> 01:29:16,919
A humble man, anxious only to serve.

995
01:29:19,161 --> 01:29:22,517
Why are the eyes of a statue
always without life?

996
01:29:24,801 --> 01:29:27,076
Have any of you here seen the Nile?

997
01:29:27,281 --> 01:29:29,476
Spare yourselves the journey.

998
01:29:29,681 --> 01:29:32,320
She carries it within her eyes.

999
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:35,676
I suggest, Caesar,
that the hour is late.

1000
01:29:35,881 --> 01:29:37,712
Very late for Rome.

1001
01:29:37,921 --> 01:29:39,832
I was speaking, Cassius! I was...

1002
01:29:43,441 --> 01:29:44,760
Now, where was I?

1003
01:29:45,001 --> 01:29:46,832
"Anxious to serve."

1004
01:29:48,201 --> 01:29:52,080
Yes, I've served.
Served for all of my life.

1005
01:29:52,281 --> 01:29:55,159
I've won for Rome
more than half of the world.

1006
01:29:55,361 --> 01:29:58,273
Most of you owe your honors
and fortunes to me.

1007
01:29:58,481 --> 01:30:02,110
And now I want you to do as I say.

1008
01:30:02,921 --> 01:30:04,912
You will appoint me...

1009
01:30:05,121 --> 01:30:07,510
...emperor of Rome.

1010
01:30:13,081 --> 01:30:15,311
There is no need to resume your seats.

1011
01:30:15,961 --> 01:30:19,795
On behalf of all, thank you,
Majesty, for your hospitality.

1012
01:30:21,881 --> 01:30:23,314
Good night.

1013
01:30:27,001 --> 01:30:29,310
Thank you and good night.

1014
01:30:38,241 --> 01:30:42,792
They resent being summoned here for
meetings properly held in the Senate.

1015
01:30:43,001 --> 01:30:45,117
Resent it, do they?

1016
01:30:46,281 --> 01:30:48,431
I cannot understand...

1017
01:30:48,681 --> 01:30:53,118
...that the eyes of a statue
should be always without life.

1018
01:30:57,921 --> 01:30:59,513
They resent me.

1019
01:30:59,761 --> 01:31:02,229
To flaunt me like this.

1020
01:31:02,481 --> 01:31:05,712
They'll use it to keep from you
that which is yours.

1021
01:31:07,041 --> 01:31:10,113
By divine right, is that not so?

1022
01:31:11,881 --> 01:31:14,076
Yes. It is.

1023
01:31:15,761 --> 01:31:18,116
By divine right.

1024
01:31:18,601 --> 01:31:23,117
We shall have the Senate,
in its deliberations, deliberate that.

1025
01:31:31,681 --> 01:31:34,149
Are you quite sure
what it is you want...

1026
01:31:34,401 --> 01:31:35,675
...so desperately?

1027
01:31:35,881 --> 01:31:38,441
I've always been sure.

1028
01:31:39,561 --> 01:31:40,676
And Caesar?

1029
01:31:42,481 --> 01:31:44,278
Does anyone speak for him?

1030
01:31:47,041 --> 01:31:48,520
No.

1031
01:31:49,281 --> 01:31:50,714
Good night.

1032
01:31:56,881 --> 01:32:00,635
Tell me, Brutus, is it proper
to stand before this goddess...

1033
01:32:00,881 --> 01:32:04,351
...Caesar's set here in the temple?
- Or must we, as Romans, kneel?

1034
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:08,554
Not yet. See there, where room
has been left for another deity?

1035
01:32:08,801 --> 01:32:12,316
When the god Caesar stands beside the
goddess Cleopatra...

1036
01:32:12,561 --> 01:32:14,313
...then Rome will crawl before them.

1037
01:32:14,521 --> 01:32:16,432
When that day comes, if it comes.

1038
01:32:16,681 --> 01:32:20,560
- He demanded we make him emperor.
- Only once, and it was his sickness.

1039
01:32:20,761 --> 01:32:23,321
His sickness grows worse.
Soon it will kill us.

1040
01:32:23,521 --> 01:32:27,434
He asked once to be made emperor,
but he's since decreed himself god!

1041
01:32:27,641 --> 01:32:32,032
Emperor and god. No longer just king,
but emperor and god!

1042
01:32:32,241 --> 01:32:35,631
- Brutus, open your eyes!
- What do you want of me?

1043
01:32:35,841 --> 01:32:38,355
When the people think
upon the honor of Rome...

1044
01:32:38,601 --> 01:32:40,671
...they think upon one man:
Brutus.

1045
01:32:40,881 --> 01:32:43,634
By that honor and
by the responsibility you carry...

1046
01:32:43,841 --> 01:32:46,275
...Brutus, save Rome from Caesar!

1047
01:32:46,481 --> 01:32:48,870
You cannot ask me to destroy him.

1048
01:32:49,081 --> 01:32:52,118
Then let Caesar destroy Rome.

1049
01:33:08,841 --> 01:33:12,914
Antony has just come from a meeting
of my friends with good news.

1050
01:33:13,121 --> 01:33:17,273
Tomorrow at the Senate, Lucius Cotta
will move that I be made king.

1051
01:33:17,481 --> 01:33:19,312
It will pass.

1052
01:33:19,841 --> 01:33:22,355
But I don't understand.

1053
01:33:22,561 --> 01:33:24,597
King and emperor.

1054
01:33:24,801 --> 01:33:26,359
And it will pass?

1055
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:28,990
The last few months,
I've been enjoying...

1056
01:33:29,201 --> 01:33:31,635
...one of the few privileges
of being dictator.

1057
01:33:31,841 --> 01:33:33,672
I have been appointing senators.

1058
01:33:33,881 --> 01:33:37,920
Slightly more than half the Senate
has been appointed by me.

1059
01:33:38,521 --> 01:33:41,593
Once again, the army of Mithradates...

1060
01:33:41,801 --> 01:33:44,031
...on its way all the time.

1061
01:33:44,241 --> 01:33:45,515
It will pass.

1062
01:33:45,761 --> 01:33:48,719
Tomorrow, the ides of March,
a day to be remembered...

1063
01:33:48,921 --> 01:33:51,435
...the Senate will declare me
king of Rome.

1064
01:33:51,641 --> 01:33:53,632
King, yes, but not of Rome.

1065
01:33:54,521 --> 01:33:57,194
Not of Rome? What are you saying?

1066
01:33:57,441 --> 01:34:00,558
They'll offer you king
of the Roman Empire, outside Italy.

1067
01:34:02,441 --> 01:34:05,319
They're afraid, Caesar.
Even your friends.

1068
01:34:05,521 --> 01:34:07,113
Afraid of the people.

1069
01:34:07,321 --> 01:34:11,155
- Perhaps in time...
- To be afraid of the people.

1070
01:34:11,361 --> 01:34:13,238
To waste time on the people.

1071
01:34:13,441 --> 01:34:16,239
King of all but Rome?

1072
01:34:16,481 --> 01:34:19,598
What is there? The huts of Gaul?
The caves of Britain?

1073
01:34:19,841 --> 01:34:22,799
The whole of the empire outside Italy.

1074
01:34:23,481 --> 01:34:25,233
I will not accept.

1075
01:34:25,481 --> 01:34:28,473
They mean it to be an empty gesture.

1076
01:34:28,681 --> 01:34:31,718
Another title to please your fancy,
flatter your ego.

1077
01:34:31,961 --> 01:34:33,314
Nothing more.

1078
01:34:34,761 --> 01:34:36,717
And it will pass.

1079
01:34:38,081 --> 01:34:39,992
Then accept it, Caesar.

1080
01:34:40,361 --> 01:34:42,716
I have never settled
for half a victory.

1081
01:34:42,961 --> 01:34:46,317
Nor will you now.
Caesar, mighty Caesar...

1082
01:34:46,521 --> 01:34:49,115
...all I can say
is what you've taught me:

1083
01:34:49,361 --> 01:34:53,559
Take a little, then a little more
until finally you have it all.

1084
01:34:54,401 --> 01:34:56,312
Let them declare you king.

1085
01:34:56,521 --> 01:34:59,433
Even if it's only
of a tree in Asia Minor.

1086
01:34:59,681 --> 01:35:01,319
The rest will come to you.

1087
01:35:01,561 --> 01:35:04,598
To redo once more everything
I have already done?

1088
01:35:04,801 --> 01:35:09,556
It's what you have never done, what
you never conquered that waits for you.

1089
01:35:09,761 --> 01:35:14,437
The great legions of Rome in the outer
empire that will become your legions.

1090
01:35:14,641 --> 01:35:18,520
The gold, the power of Egypt.
Your Egypt.

1091
01:35:18,721 --> 01:35:22,953
Caesar, you can conquer
and hold the world as your own.

1092
01:35:23,161 --> 01:35:25,675
Won't you understand?

1093
01:35:25,881 --> 01:35:29,760
Kings are not elected.
Gods are not elected.

1094
01:35:29,961 --> 01:35:33,920
Why, not only Rome but all of Italy
upon which Rome stands...

1095
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:36,721
...must fall in your hands
like a drop of sweat.

1096
01:35:36,921 --> 01:35:38,798
Let them make you what they choose.

1097
01:35:39,041 --> 01:35:41,350
I'll serve with you.
My legions with yours.

1098
01:35:41,561 --> 01:35:46,476
Together we'll conquer a world beyond
the wildest dreams of Alexander.

1099
01:35:46,681 --> 01:35:49,400
Rome.
What was Rome when Sulla died...

1100
01:35:49,641 --> 01:35:52,474
...when Crassus lost the armies
in Parthia?

1101
01:35:52,721 --> 01:35:55,360
These same men came after me
through the streets...

1102
01:35:55,601 --> 01:35:59,116
...howling like frightened dogs,
"Caesar, save us!"

1103
01:35:59,321 --> 01:36:01,516
They would've made me king then.

1104
01:36:01,721 --> 01:36:04,076
I wouldn't let them then.

1105
01:36:14,041 --> 01:36:17,351
He was thrown over the wall.
It's not a pretty sight.

1106
01:36:17,721 --> 01:36:19,677
Titus, the moneylender.

1107
01:36:19,921 --> 01:36:23,277
Why should he be killed savagely
and brought here?

1108
01:36:23,481 --> 01:36:26,279
Obviously, I am being warned.

1109
01:36:26,481 --> 01:36:28,233
Perhaps I am next.

1110
01:36:28,441 --> 01:36:30,511
They dare to threaten you?

1111
01:36:30,761 --> 01:36:33,480
- Caesarion. Where was my son...?
- Not far away.

1112
01:36:33,681 --> 01:36:35,558
It frightened him.

1113
01:36:41,681 --> 01:36:45,469
- Lepidus, how many legions has he now?
- Fifteen. Perhaps more.

1114
01:36:45,681 --> 01:36:47,399
- Where?
- Scythia.

1115
01:36:47,641 --> 01:36:49,871
You and I will dine
with Lepidus tonight.

1116
01:36:50,081 --> 01:36:53,790
We'll talk of armies and battlefields
and lists of men to die.

1117
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:58,193
Tomorrow in the Senate, let them offer
the sands of Libya as my kingdom...

1118
01:36:58,401 --> 01:37:00,278
...I will accept.

1119
01:37:38,721 --> 01:37:41,076
This is great Caesar...

1120
01:37:41,321 --> 01:37:43,277
...beloved by Rome...

1121
01:37:44,121 --> 01:37:46,555
...and at least one of us...

1122
01:37:46,761 --> 01:37:49,912
...who must die so that Rome may live.

1123
01:37:50,161 --> 01:37:54,677
If it must be done, then let us do it
unashamed and unafraid.

1124
01:37:55,161 --> 01:37:58,676
If the world is to know that
Rome will not have a king...

1125
01:37:58,881 --> 01:38:02,920
...then let us make it the honorable
act of free men in the light of day.

1126
01:38:03,121 --> 01:38:05,191
In the light of what day, Brutus?

1127
01:38:05,401 --> 01:38:07,073
Tomorrow?

1128
01:38:08,201 --> 01:38:11,671
In the curia of the Senate?

1129
01:38:12,561 --> 01:38:15,473
And shall we be armed, all of us?

1130
01:38:20,641 --> 01:38:25,078
Decimus, come to Caesar's villa early
tomorrow to escort him to the Senate.

1131
01:38:25,281 --> 01:38:29,399
Cimber, Marc Antony must not enter
the curia with Caesar.

1132
01:38:29,601 --> 01:38:34,038
On a pretext, lead him aside to speak
of what you heard at Lepidus' house.

1133
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:36,630
I remember something odd.

1134
01:38:36,841 --> 01:38:39,309
At one point,
Caesar asked of each of us...

1135
01:38:39,521 --> 01:38:42,194
...what manner of death
we would choose.

1136
01:38:42,441 --> 01:38:45,877
And Caesar, when it came to him,
looked straight at me and said:

1137
01:38:46,081 --> 01:38:47,878
"Sudden."

1138
01:38:49,721 --> 01:38:51,677
Odd, isn't it?

1139
01:39:13,961 --> 01:39:16,111
I was afraid I'd find you
still asleep.

1140
01:39:16,361 --> 01:39:19,512
Caesarion is.
He was awake most of the night.

1141
01:39:19,721 --> 01:39:21,439
Did the storm frighten him?

1142
01:39:21,641 --> 01:39:25,429
He said not, but it did.
I could tell.

1143
01:39:25,641 --> 01:39:27,359
Have you time to come in?

1144
01:39:27,561 --> 01:39:32,032
Decimus awaits. He came by expressly
to accompany me to the Senate.

1145
01:39:32,241 --> 01:39:34,596
Decimus? Has he done this before?

1146
01:39:34,841 --> 01:39:36,354
A shrewd politician.

1147
01:39:36,601 --> 01:39:40,037
He hopes to benefit
by arriving with me, this day of days.

1148
01:39:40,241 --> 01:39:42,550
Keep Antony close by.

1149
01:39:44,401 --> 01:39:46,198
You too?

1150
01:39:46,401 --> 01:39:49,234
The ladies of Rome seem to have caught
each other's fears this morning.

1151
01:39:49,441 --> 01:39:51,159
Like a head cold.

1152
01:39:51,361 --> 01:39:54,433
Calpurnia pleaded with me
not to go to the Senate at all.

1153
01:39:54,641 --> 01:39:57,917
Why? Why would she
not want you to go?

1154
01:39:58,161 --> 01:40:00,277
Oh, the bad night. Nothing else.

1155
01:40:00,521 --> 01:40:03,831
She awoke screaming in her sleep.
The thunder, the lightning.

1156
01:40:04,041 --> 01:40:08,080
She dreamed that she saw me murdered.
That she saw me...

1157
01:40:08,321 --> 01:40:10,391
...or a statue of me covered in blood.

1158
01:40:10,641 --> 01:40:13,997
The servants told her of seeing
men of fire in the heavens...

1159
01:40:14,201 --> 01:40:16,112
...odd happenings and so forth.

1160
01:40:16,321 --> 01:40:18,915
Strange birds were seen in the Forum.

1161
01:40:19,121 --> 01:40:23,990
One flew into the Senate carrying a
sprig of laurel which it dropped...

1162
01:40:24,241 --> 01:40:26,675
...at the base of Pompey's statue.

1163
01:40:26,961 --> 01:40:28,474
Pompey?

1164
01:40:29,761 --> 01:40:33,959
- Caesar, I'm afraid.
- You must not tell me to stay away.

1165
01:40:34,201 --> 01:40:36,271
Shall I too be afraid?

1166
01:40:36,521 --> 01:40:40,560
Can it be said of Caesar, he gave up
the world because of a thunderstorm?

1167
01:40:40,761 --> 01:40:44,470
That such divinity that was in him ran
before mortal superstition?

1168
01:40:45,281 --> 01:40:47,272
I feel you need me now...

1169
01:40:47,481 --> 01:40:49,199
...and I cannot help you.

1170
01:40:49,441 --> 01:40:54,356
Then help me to live as I have lived,
always differently from the rest.

1171
01:40:54,721 --> 01:40:58,714
The others, for whom life is merely
an endless fear of dying.

1172
01:41:00,241 --> 01:41:01,879
Your gods...

1173
01:41:02,081 --> 01:41:04,879
...and mine go with you, Caesar.

1174
01:41:06,881 --> 01:41:10,999
The world, except for you,
is filled with little men.

1175
01:42:14,681 --> 01:42:16,672
Fire burns.

1176
01:42:16,921 --> 01:42:19,481
Fire burns.

1177
01:42:20,241 --> 01:42:22,835
The winds of destruction blow.

1178
01:42:24,521 --> 01:42:26,398
Rome...

1179
01:42:26,641 --> 01:42:30,475
...mighty and alone, the winds of
destruction blow down upon thee!

1180
01:42:30,681 --> 01:42:32,797
Storms and hail
shall cut down wheat...

1181
01:42:33,001 --> 01:42:35,754
...shall cut down birds
and living things of earth.

1182
01:42:35,961 --> 01:42:38,077
The heavens...

1183
01:42:38,361 --> 01:42:40,921
...and the gods themselves.

1184
01:44:48,441 --> 01:44:50,875
My son!

1185
01:45:05,521 --> 01:45:06,920
<i>Caesar! Caesar!</i>

1186
01:45:07,161 --> 01:45:08,992
<i>Caesar! Caesar!</i>

1187
01:47:47,281 --> 01:47:49,112
There has been much to do.

1188
01:47:49,361 --> 01:47:52,273
And it seems you have
done it extremely well.

1189
01:47:54,681 --> 01:47:56,717
Is that where...?

1190
01:47:56,961 --> 01:47:58,280
Yes.

1191
01:48:01,161 --> 01:48:05,677
In Egypt, we build eternal monuments
to our dead heroes.

1192
01:48:06,001 --> 01:48:08,754
Here, you burn them like rubbish.

1193
01:48:09,001 --> 01:48:10,070
Goodbye.

1194
01:48:10,281 --> 01:48:13,273
I've brought the 10th Legion.
You have nothing to fear.

1195
01:48:14,561 --> 01:48:18,031
Nothing to fear?
That's no reason for staying.

1196
01:48:19,361 --> 01:48:21,511
So much has happened so quickly.

1197
01:48:21,721 --> 01:48:24,872
Suddenly I have the pieces
of a broken world to pick up:

1198
01:48:25,121 --> 01:48:27,840
Caesar, you running off
at night like this.

1199
01:48:28,041 --> 01:48:29,918
Do you suggest that I stay? Why?

1200
01:48:30,121 --> 01:48:33,796
Don't ask me to be clear about
my feelings right now. I'm tired.

1201
01:48:34,241 --> 01:48:37,278
And with you,
it's never easy to say my meaning.

1202
01:48:38,001 --> 01:48:40,913
But you speak so well, Antony.

1203
01:48:41,121 --> 01:48:44,238
I've been told how excitingly
you read Caesar's will...

1204
01:48:44,441 --> 01:48:48,320
...to the sobbing, murdering,
free citizens of Rome.

1205
01:48:48,521 --> 01:48:52,833
Naming as his heir
his great nephew, Octavian!

1206
01:48:53,081 --> 01:48:55,470
I knew Caesar's will
and the reasons for it.

1207
01:48:55,681 --> 01:48:57,512
If Octavian hadn't been named...

1208
01:48:57,761 --> 01:49:00,480
...how many hours or minutes
would you have survived?

1209
01:49:02,121 --> 01:49:04,555
And if Caesar had become truly king...

1210
01:49:04,761 --> 01:49:07,673
...do you believe he would
still have named Octavian?

1211
01:49:09,921 --> 01:49:11,957
In any case, it's over.

1212
01:49:12,161 --> 01:49:13,753
Caesar...

1213
01:49:14,001 --> 01:49:16,879
...and the dream
that was murdered with him.

1214
01:49:17,561 --> 01:49:19,870
First Alexander's...

1215
01:49:20,881 --> 01:49:22,872
...then Caesar's.

1216
01:49:23,081 --> 01:49:25,037
Now over. Finished.

1217
01:49:25,241 --> 01:49:27,755
- First, Rome must be put in order.
- Rome again.

1218
01:49:27,961 --> 01:49:30,555
Brutus and the others
must be found and killed.

1219
01:49:30,801 --> 01:49:32,120
- Then?
- In death...

1220
01:49:32,361 --> 01:49:36,240
...Caesar must be granted the power
and title he was denied in life.

1221
01:49:36,441 --> 01:49:40,150
A dead king, a dead god.
Safe enough even for Rome.

1222
01:49:40,401 --> 01:49:45,270
Caesarion as Caesar's son could claim
the title of king and his deification.

1223
01:49:45,921 --> 01:49:49,709
And to what court of law
would my son and I take our claim?

1224
01:49:49,921 --> 01:49:53,072
I will present it
to the Roman Senate myself.

1225
01:49:55,361 --> 01:49:57,875
I believe you would.

1226
01:49:58,201 --> 01:50:01,352
And after the noble senators
have stopped laughing...

1227
01:50:01,561 --> 01:50:04,678
...do my son and I
then declare war on Rome?

1228
01:50:04,881 --> 01:50:09,193
No. For this,
a Caesar would be needed.

1229
01:50:09,401 --> 01:50:11,869
You have very little time.

1230
01:50:14,121 --> 01:50:16,077
Another Caesar.

1231
01:50:16,441 --> 01:50:20,719
But thank you.
I shall remember your kindness to us.

1232
01:50:20,921 --> 01:50:23,674
- You give up too easily.
- Do I?

1233
01:50:24,641 --> 01:50:27,394
Let me come to Alexandria
and talk more with you.

1234
01:50:27,641 --> 01:50:31,475
- Whenever you like.
- Now. Tonight, if I could.

1235
01:50:33,761 --> 01:50:35,877
In any case, try to remember.
