1
00:08:00,635 --> 00:08:05,805
<i>This land has a name today</i>
<i>and is marked on maps.</i>

2
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:10,895
<i>But the names and the marks and the land</i>
<i>all had to be won.</i>

3
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:14,525
<i>Won from nature and from primitive man.</i>

4
00:08:15,315 --> 00:08:20,825
<i>Five generations ago,</i>
<i>a mere 125 years back...</i>

5
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:24,033
<i>... this land was known</i>
<i>only as the West.</i>

6
00:08:24,195 --> 00:08:27,575
<i>Known only to a handful of white men...</i>

7
00:08:27,745 --> 00:08:32,495
<i>... lonely trappers wandering its vastness</i>
<i>in search of beaver.</i>

8
00:08:32,665 --> 00:08:35,755
<i>They were known as mountain men,</i>
<i>a new breed.</i>

9
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:40,845
<i>Men like Jim Bridger,</i>
<i>Franch√®re and Sublette, Linus Rawlings.</i>

10
00:08:41,005 --> 00:08:44,425
<i>More Indian than the Indians</i>
<i>in all but blood.</i>

11
00:08:44,595 --> 00:08:47,555
<i>They held to no law but their own...</i>

12
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:53,315
<i>... drifted free as the clouds,</i>
<i>settled nowhere, kept forever on the move.</i>

13
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:59,315
<i>Their mocassined feet and unshod horses</i>
<i>leaving no trace on the land.</i>

14
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:03,525
<i>Like the Indians,</i>
<i>with whom they were at peace...</i>

15
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:08,205
<i>... they wanted nothing beyond</i>
<i>what they found, and little of that.</i>

16
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:12,875
<i>The mountains, the forests,</i>
<i>the harsh country...</i>

17
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:16,545
<i>... were as unchanging to them</i>
<i>as the stars...</i>

18
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:19,425
<i>... and just as unyielding.</i>

19
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:25,135
<i>Far behind the mountains,</i>
<i>beyond the rolling plains...</i>

20
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:31,015
<i>... they had left the people of the East,</i>
<i>people who were restless in another way.</i>

21
00:09:31,725 --> 00:09:35,065
<i>The kind who'd look at a mountain</i>
<i>and see a watershed...</i>

22
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:37,525
<i>... look at a forest</i>
<i>and see lumber for houses...</i>

23
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:40,395
<i>... look at a stony field and see a farm.</i>

24
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:44,655
<i>Their faces and their instincts</i>
<i>had been turned to the West...</i>

25
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:47,905
<i>... ever since Plymouth Rock</i>
<i>and Jamestown.</i>

26
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:52,165
<i>The trapper's road was the trail</i>
<i>of a wolf or the bend of a canyon.</i>

27
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,835
<i>But for whole families</i>
<i>chaffing to follow the sun...</i>

28
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,545
<i>... there had to be broader ways.</i>

29
00:09:58,705 --> 00:10:03,255
<i>There were no roads into the wilderness,</i>
<i>only rivers.</i>

30
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:06,465
<i>And they flowed in the wrong direction:</i>
<i>North or south.</i>

31
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:09,765
<i>Or else they stopped at the Alleghenies.</i>

32
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:16,685
<i>Until one day, a new river took source</i>
<i>in the mind of a man named DeWitt Clinton.</i>

33
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:20,275
<i>He conceived of a river</i>
<i>that would go west.</i>

34
00:10:20,435 --> 00:10:25,775
<i>And in the way Americans have</i>
<i>of acting out their dreams, it came to be.</i>

35
00:10:25,945 --> 00:10:28,615
<i>The Erie Canal left the Hudson</i>
<i>above Albany...</i>

36
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:32,245
<i>... and carried clear across</i>
<i>to the Great Lakes.</i>

37
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:35,785
<i>People who yearned for virgin land</i>
<i>and a new life...</i>

38
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:38,295
<i>... now had a highway to take them.</i>

39
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:40,045
<i>And they moved along.</i>

40
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:42,795
Pride of Utica now loading!

41
00:10:43,465 --> 00:10:47,175
<i>All aboard for the Pride of Utica!</i>

42
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:50,975
The Ramsey family, Peter Smith...

43
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:53,515
...the Skoga family!

44
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:55,685
All eight of them!

45
00:10:55,855 --> 00:11:00,395
<i>All aboard for the Pride of Utica!</i>

46
00:11:01,815 --> 00:11:04,695
Is the laddie's health
the reason you're heading west?

47
00:11:04,855 --> 00:11:05,985
Partly.

48
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:09,155
Only partly.
Mostly our trouble East was rocks.

49
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:12,825
I had me a farm where some years
I'd raise 100 bushels of rocks to the acre.

50
00:11:12,995 --> 00:11:15,495
Zebulon, you hadn't
ought to lie to the man like that.

51
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:19,245
Wife, I'm a God-fearing soul,
and I tell the truth as I see it.

52
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:22,835
Now, I never used a plow.
I'd blast out the furrows with gunpowder.

53
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:25,925
And then one morning,
I hauled the bucket up out of the well...

54
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,965
...and so help me,
the bucket was full of rocks.

55
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:30,175
Rocks.

56
00:11:30,345 --> 00:11:33,475
I just stood there right still
trying not to blaspheme.

57
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:36,055
I said to myself,
"You've got a son that's ailing...

58
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:38,805
...you've got a daughter
what won't take to herself a husband."

59
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:41,185
- There she sits there, mooning as usual.
- Pa.

60
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:44,195
You've got another who don't seem
quite right in the head.

61
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:46,355
Lilith?

62
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:50,025
Yes, Pa?

63
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:53,075
Now, I'll remind you, sir.

64
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:57,205
I'm still standing there
holding a bucket full of rocks...

65
00:11:57,365 --> 00:12:00,245
...and staring into a bleak old age.

66
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:02,795
So I made me a vow
right then and there. I said:

67
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:07,215
"If I can find a man with $500
who likes rocks...

68
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:10,045
...then there's gonna be another fool
owning this farm."

69
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:13,885
Well, sir, the Lord provided such a man...

70
00:12:14,055 --> 00:12:15,265
...and here I am.

71
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:18,225
He ain't told you one word of truth,
Mr. Harvey.

72
00:12:18,395 --> 00:12:20,185
We had the best farm in the township.

73
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:22,725
Yeah, Rockville Township it was.
Stone County.

74
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:24,395
Oh, it was not.

75
00:12:24,565 --> 00:12:27,235
It was his itching foot
that brought us here.

76
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:29,695
Heaven knows where we'll end up.

77
00:12:30,405 --> 00:12:34,245
Oh, these are my laddies.
Angus, Brutus and Colin.

78
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:35,575
- How do you do?
- Hello.

79
00:12:35,745 --> 00:12:39,455
I think they're already acquainted
with your daughters.

80
00:12:39,705 --> 00:12:43,085
- Be they single?
- Aye, single so far.

81
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:46,545
Well, this Illinois country's beginning
to sound better to me.

82
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:47,755
Lilith?

83
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:51,215
Lilith, here. Strike up a little tune
for these handsome lads.

84
00:12:51,385 --> 00:12:54,515
- Oh, I ain't in no mood, Pa.
- Lilith, there's a time for coaxing...

85
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:56,385
...this ain't the time.

86
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:58,055
All right.

87
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:02,265
All right.

88
00:13:04,105 --> 00:13:08,565
<i>A captain bold in Halifax</i>
<i>Who lived in country quarters</i>

89
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,405
<i>Betrayed a maid who hanged herself</i>
<i>One morning in her garters...</i>

90
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,865
Lilith.

91
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:16,785
Now, you know better
than to sing a song like that.

92
00:13:16,945 --> 00:13:19,285
- What ones do you know?
- We know "Yankee Doodle."

93
00:13:19,455 --> 00:13:21,245
- "Yankee Doodle"?
- Their mother's dead.

94
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:24,455
They haven't had much learning
in the social graces.

95
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,085
All right, give them
"A Home in the Meadow."

96
00:13:31,795 --> 00:13:34,305
Eve, come on, you too.

97
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:36,515
That's it.

98
00:13:37,465 --> 00:13:39,135
Come on, join in.

99
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:42,435
That's it.

100
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:49,235
Come on.

101
00:13:53,815 --> 00:13:56,155
Stop.

102
00:14:10,005 --> 00:14:12,885
<i>Loading for the Flying Arrow!</i>

103
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:17,005
<i>All aboard for the Flying Arrow!</i>

104
00:14:17,505 --> 00:14:20,555
- The Prescott family!
- Here we be. Come on.

105
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:24,685
Alec Harvey and three sons!

106
00:14:24,855 --> 00:14:28,315
Jeffrey Rose and family!

107
00:14:58,885 --> 00:15:03,185
<i>But the canal was only the first step</i>
<i>toward the promised land.</i>

108
00:15:03,345 --> 00:15:06,555
<i>The next steps were longer and harder.</i>

109
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:11,565
<i>Those who could raise the fare</i>
<i>went by steamboat to the end of the line.</i>

110
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:15,195
<i>Others found a cheaper way</i>
<i>to head for Ohio, Illinois...</i>

111
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:17,655
<i>... and the open spaces beyond.</i>

112
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:37,085
Lilith. Lilith, listen to this:

113
00:15:37,255 --> 00:15:40,715
"Theirs was a poignant parting
in the forest.

114
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:45,265
The handsome young backwoodsman
carved two hearts on a tree trunk...

115
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:49,815
...then from ten paces, hurled a knife
at the junction of the two hearts."

116
00:15:49,975 --> 00:15:51,565
Junction. What's that?

117
00:15:52,775 --> 00:15:55,645
Well, that's where the two hearts meet.
Now, listen:

118
00:15:55,815 --> 00:15:58,235
"His marksmanship was uncanny.

119
00:15:58,405 --> 00:16:03,945
Three times he hurled the knife on target.
'That was for luck,, he said the first time.

120
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:07,995
'That was for love. Deep, divine love"
he said the second.

121
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:14,125
And the third time, 'That was a prayer,
a plea for love undying."'

122
00:16:14,295 --> 00:16:15,965
Isn't that beautiful?

123
00:16:17,085 --> 00:16:19,795
I reckon. If anybody ever talks like that.

124
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:23,135
Well, it's the sentiments, not the talk.

125
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:25,635
There ain't no sense to you, Eve.

126
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:29,515
You wanna to be a farm wife,
but you don't wanna marry a farmer.

127
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:31,725
Neither do you.

128
00:16:31,895 --> 00:16:32,935
Of course not.

129
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:35,525
I don't wanna have
nothing to do with farms.

130
00:16:35,685 --> 00:16:40,695
I want silk dresses and fine carriages
and a man to smell good.

131
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:43,695
What I want's back East, not West.

132
00:16:43,865 --> 00:16:46,155
But I'll get there yet. You watch.

133
00:16:46,825 --> 00:16:49,325
You don't know what you want yet.

134
00:16:49,535 --> 00:16:52,665
It's the man that counts,
not where he lives.

135
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,255
- Ready, now?
Ready.

136
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:42,925
Daddy, Daddy, something coming upriver.
Hostile Indians, I suspect.

137
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:06,695
- Could it be river pirates, Zebulon?
- Don't know.

138
00:18:06,865 --> 00:18:09,245
They say no honest man
travels this river at night.

139
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:11,165
I can only see one man, Pa.

140
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:14,535
I hear that's a favorite pirate trick.
They hide in the bottom of the boat...

141
00:18:14,705 --> 00:18:16,335
...till they're ready to jump you.

142
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,505
- Get my gun, Colin.
- All right, Pa.

143
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:28,765
Just come in slow and easy, stranger.

144
00:18:29,845 --> 00:18:32,765
And keep your hands
where we can see them.

145
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,785
Name's Linus Rawlings.

146
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:54,625
I'm hungrier than sin
and real peaceful like.

147
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,955
- What have you got in the craft?
- Beaver pelts.

148
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,625
I said beaver pelts.

149
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:03,755
I never had a chance to see a beaver pelt,
Mr. Rawlings.

150
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:07,845
Well, in that case, ma'am,
I'll show you one.

151
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:09,845
There you are.

152
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,095
That's real soft.

153
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:13,515
It's a fine pelt, ma'am.

154
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,055
Now, my apologies, sir.

155
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:19,645
- We was afeared you might be a pirate.
- I ain't no pirate.

156
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:22,855
Come on, let's have supper
and get acquainted.

157
00:19:23,355 --> 00:19:27,655
No, no, no. That's yours.
Keep that, ma'am.

158
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:43,965
Well, you sure set your cap in a hurry.

159
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,465
Is he the backwoodsman
you've been waiting for?

160
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:50,505
More than likely he's got
a wife and six kids waiting for him.

161
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:18,035
Thank you, ma'am, that was right tasty.

162
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:21,585
You've only had four plates.
I was beginning to think you didn't like it.

163
00:20:21,745 --> 00:20:25,875
Well, it don't pay to eat too much
on an empty stomach, ma'am.

164
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:28,425
How come you're to be traveling
so late at night?

165
00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:30,715
Well, I'm kind of anxious
to get to Pittsburgh.

166
00:20:30,885 --> 00:20:34,215
I ain't seen a city for a long time.
I aim to whoop it up a little.

167
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:37,975
Well, now, we've never seen
a mountain man before.

168
00:20:38,145 --> 00:20:41,685
Tell me, them Rocky Mountains
as high as they say?

169
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:46,855
Well, now, I just don't rightly know.
I never climbed one. I've...

170
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:48,525
Uh...

171
00:20:48,695 --> 00:20:53,075
Well, you know,
that just ain't exactly true.

172
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:55,155
Jim Bridger and me...

173
00:20:55,325 --> 00:21:00,415
...we started up one of them little-bitty
Rocky Mountain foothills, you know.

174
00:21:00,915 --> 00:21:04,705
And then, one day, we see this fella...

175
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:09,175
...and he has a great big pair
of white wings...

176
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,005
...and a harp in his hand.

177
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:13,715
And I said to Jim...

178
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:17,675
...I said, "Jim, I don't like the way
that fella's looking at us."

179
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:22,015
And Jim said he didn't care too much
for it neither...

180
00:21:22,185 --> 00:21:24,265
...so we both skedaddled down
out of there...

181
00:21:24,435 --> 00:21:28,445
...and to this day I ain't never had
a good look at the Rocky Mountains.

182
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:36,325
- Well, I remember one time...
- Zebulon.

183
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,705
- What?
- One liar at a time is enough.

184
00:21:41,495 --> 00:21:45,955
Well, then, I reckon it's about bedtime.
Gotta get an early start in the morning.

185
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,955
We'll be expecting you for breakfast.

186
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:50,465
Oh, well, that's mighty hospitable,
Mr. Prescott...

187
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,005
...but sometimes I wake up
and get the urge to move.

188
00:21:53,175 --> 00:21:55,425
I might be long gone by sunup,
but thank you.

189
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:59,135
- I wanna thank all of you. Good night.
- Good night.

190
00:22:00,345 --> 00:22:05,315
- Strange fellas, these mountain men.
- Yeah, kind of like a wisp of smoke.

191
00:22:24,835 --> 00:22:28,085
- By golly, that looks like my blanket.
- It is.

192
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:31,715
Well, then, I'm a mite confused, ma'am.
Whose bed would it be?

193
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,835
Yours.

194
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:38,925
I ain't ever saw a bed like that
since last time I come east.

195
00:22:39,305 --> 00:22:41,135
Why'd you do it?

196
00:22:41,305 --> 00:22:44,555
Ain't polite to ask a girl
why she done something for a man.

197
00:22:45,145 --> 00:22:47,855
No. Well, I reckon my manners
ain't much at that.

198
00:22:48,015 --> 00:22:51,565
Anyway, I sure thank you.
Good night, ma'am.

199
00:22:56,195 --> 00:22:58,235
Are them Indian girls pretty?

200
00:22:58,405 --> 00:23:02,245
Well, now, I reckon that all depends
on just how long a man has gone...

201
00:23:02,405 --> 00:23:04,495
...without seeing one.

202
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:08,545
How long's it been
since you seen a white girl?

203
00:23:08,995 --> 00:23:11,505
I ain't quite sure why you asked that.

204
00:23:13,795 --> 00:23:15,795
How pretty do I look to you?

205
00:23:15,965 --> 00:23:17,675
But, ma'am...

206
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:21,475
...ain't you just being a little bit forward?

207
00:23:21,635 --> 00:23:26,725
Well, you're headed upriver
and I'm headed down.

208
00:23:26,895 --> 00:23:29,645
There's no time
to get these questions answered.

209
00:23:32,235 --> 00:23:34,815
You dead sure you want them answered?

210
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:38,525
Yes.

211
00:23:51,755 --> 00:23:53,415
Glory be.

212
00:23:55,045 --> 00:23:57,385
Ma'am, it seems like
you've been kissed before.

213
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:02,095
I've never been kissed permanent before.

214
00:24:03,595 --> 00:24:05,885
By golly, you sure use surprising words.

215
00:24:06,055 --> 00:24:10,225
I never heard "permanent" mixed up
with a thing like a kiss before.

216
00:24:11,975 --> 00:24:14,355
I can still feel that kiss.

217
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:16,855
- Can you?
- Well, you said something before...

218
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:18,775
...that we had not forget:

219
00:24:18,945 --> 00:24:22,785
I'm heading upstream
and you're headed downstream.

220
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:25,455
Lovers have parted before
and come together again.

221
00:24:25,615 --> 00:24:27,035
- Ma'am.
- Eve.

222
00:24:28,955 --> 00:24:33,165
Eve, I'm a sinful man.

223
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,965
Deep, dark, sinful.

224
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:40,135
I'm on my way to Pittsburgh
to be sinful again.

225
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:42,095
Likely I'll stay drunk for a month.

226
00:24:42,255 --> 00:24:44,975
I won't even remember
the fancy gals I dally with...

227
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:48,015
...or the men I carve up
just out of pure cussedness...

228
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:50,805
...any more than I'll remember you.

229
00:24:51,645 --> 00:24:56,275
Linus, I'm asking you.
Can you still feel that kiss?

230
00:24:56,435 --> 00:24:57,565
Eve...

231
00:24:59,605 --> 00:25:04,535
Eve, you make me feel like a man
standing on a narrow ledge...

232
00:25:04,695 --> 00:25:08,785
...coming face-to-face with a grizzly bear.

233
00:25:09,495 --> 00:25:14,125
There just ain't no ignoring the situation.

234
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:37,355
Eve!

235
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:42,275
Eve!

236
00:25:42,445 --> 00:25:44,695
- Eve! Where is she?
- Zeb, what's the matter?

237
00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:47,865
Anyways, you're here.
I thought you'd gone with him.

238
00:25:48,035 --> 00:25:51,035
- Gone?
- Yes, gone.

239
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:53,375
I knowed you were setting with him...

240
00:25:53,535 --> 00:25:56,545
...but I kept telling myself,
"At least she's looking at a man."

241
00:25:56,705 --> 00:26:00,465
Even a wisp of smoke like that
is better than...

242
00:26:02,545 --> 00:26:05,885
Are you crying? Crying for him?
Now, what does that mean?

243
00:26:07,015 --> 00:26:09,095
Now, tell me what that means.

244
00:26:10,225 --> 00:26:11,725
Nothing, Pa.

245
00:26:11,895 --> 00:26:14,055
What time did you come to bed?

246
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:16,565
It was early, Pa.

247
00:26:16,895 --> 00:26:19,605
It wasn't. It was late.

248
00:26:19,775 --> 00:26:22,405
Daughter, I'm only gonna ask you once.

249
00:26:22,565 --> 00:26:25,985
Is there anything for your ma and pa
to worry about?

250
00:26:26,525 --> 00:26:28,655
No, Pa, there ain't.

251
00:26:45,345 --> 00:26:47,135
He'll be back.

252
00:26:47,635 --> 00:26:49,175
I'll see him again.

253
00:26:49,345 --> 00:26:53,095
But you expected to see him this morning.
You know you did.

254
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:56,435
I don't care. I'll see him again.

255
00:26:56,855 --> 00:26:58,525
Look.

256
00:27:04,405 --> 00:27:10,075
- You got a growed man to do that?
- I did. Just like in the book.

257
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:13,285
Did you get him to say them crazy words?

258
00:27:13,455 --> 00:27:16,575
I told you before, it ain't the words,
it's the sentiment.

259
00:27:17,665 --> 00:27:21,125
You mean, he didn't even giggle nor nothing
at such foolishness?

260
00:27:22,215 --> 00:27:25,425
He said it was a real solemn occasion.

261
00:27:25,585 --> 00:27:28,255
Like shooting the rapids without a paddle.

262
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:34,095
No matter what he said, he did it just
to get rid of you so as he could clear out.

263
00:27:34,265 --> 00:27:36,395
You know that's so.

264
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:40,395
And you're lucky he did. Do you wanna
live like a squaw all your life?

265
00:27:40,565 --> 00:27:43,025
Go on, say anything you like...

266
00:27:43,185 --> 00:27:46,105
...but I'll see him again. I know I will.

267
00:27:46,275 --> 00:27:48,575
And he ain't got a wife and six kids.

268
00:27:49,325 --> 00:27:51,945
He ain't got a wife at all yet.

269
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:06,795
Hey, Pierre!

270
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:08,295
Someone's coming upriver.

271
00:28:23,275 --> 00:28:24,395
Customer.

272
00:28:33,285 --> 00:28:34,865
Trapper, seems like.

273
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:38,915
See how that cover bellies up?
Could be furs.

274
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:52,305
Thirsty, mister?

275
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:56,015
Drier than a grasshopper on a hot griddle.

276
00:28:59,225 --> 00:29:01,815
Well, welcome to our little inn, sir.

277
00:29:01,975 --> 00:29:04,975
My name is Jeb Hawkins,
late colonel of the Alabama militia.

278
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:06,685
- Where you bound for?
- Pittsburgh.

279
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:07,895
Pittsburgh? Well.

280
00:29:08,065 --> 00:29:10,615
Looks like he's got
a whole canoe of furs, Pop.

281
00:29:10,775 --> 00:29:12,985
- Sure enough mountain man.
- Indeed.

282
00:29:13,155 --> 00:29:16,745
One of our explorers gonna extend
our domain to the far shores of the Pacific.

283
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:19,245
Well, nothing but the finest for you, sir.
Whiskey?

284
00:29:19,415 --> 00:29:21,995
- Right.
- No pepper or rattlesnake heads in this.

285
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:24,585
Nothing but the pure grain
and the sweet kiss of the malt.

286
00:29:24,745 --> 00:29:29,585
- Never mind the cup, I'll just take the jug.
- Oh, a real mountain man, huh?

287
00:29:29,755 --> 00:29:33,595
- I trust you'll toast our noble banner, sir.
- Sure will.

288
00:29:54,445 --> 00:29:56,615
Golly, you're right.
That's real sipping liquor.

289
00:29:56,785 --> 00:30:00,495
Pa, him being a trapper, you suppose he
might know what that varmint is we got?

290
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:03,285
Well, say, now, he might.
Yes, sir, he just might.

291
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:05,795
Sir, we caught us
a cave-dwelling critter...

292
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:08,045
...that no man in these parts
has seen before.

293
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:11,465
You know, it'd be right satisfying
to having you tell us what it is.

294
00:30:11,795 --> 00:30:15,635
Well, I don't know too much
about cave-dwelling varmints.

295
00:30:15,805 --> 00:30:19,135
Just yonder. Take your jug.

296
00:30:19,635 --> 00:30:21,805
Well, I...

297
00:30:23,805 --> 00:30:25,815
I don't know.

298
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:44,705
WOIt's right over here.

299
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:57,175
You know any sweet-talking gals
in Pittsburgh?

300
00:30:57,345 --> 00:31:00,015
No, no. Nary a one, yet.

301
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:02,515
Well, Pop and I are hoping
we'll vacation there.

302
00:31:02,685 --> 00:31:06,645
I'll be at the Duquesne House
if it ain't burned down.

303
00:31:06,805 --> 00:31:13,315
Hey, there, now, you pretty girl,
you sure you got a varmint in here?

304
00:31:13,525 --> 00:31:14,985
Now, you...

305
00:31:15,155 --> 00:31:16,775
WODo you hear him?
Huh?

306
00:31:16,945 --> 00:31:19,405
WOHe breathes loud and fierce.

307
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:23,785
- We keep him in this hole just yonder.
You keep him in there?

308
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:28,375
You gotta look a little closer.

309
00:31:48,055 --> 00:31:49,895
Well, he seen the varmint, Pa.

310
00:31:50,065 --> 00:31:53,025
- Well done, daughter.
- I ain't so sure.

311
00:31:53,185 --> 00:31:56,565
He was hard muscled. I could feel
the blade just skitter along his ribs.

312
00:31:56,735 --> 00:31:58,865
Oh, you just need more practice,
that's all.

313
00:31:59,025 --> 00:32:01,405
It's a pity you ain't got the knack
your ma had.

314
00:32:01,575 --> 00:32:03,575
Lord rest her soul.

315
00:32:03,745 --> 00:32:05,915
All right, men, lay it on, men.

316
00:32:06,075 --> 00:32:09,035
Come on, come on.
We got more fish to fry.

317
00:32:09,205 --> 00:32:11,335
Down to the island.

318
00:33:08,095 --> 00:33:10,975
Tell Pa them settlers, rafts are coming.

319
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:37,165
Can't I have this toilet water, Pa?

320
00:33:37,335 --> 00:33:40,295
- Genuine Parisian accent, it says.
- How much is it?

321
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:42,045
It's only 15 cents.

322
00:33:42,215 --> 00:33:44,135
Fifteen cents? Put it back.

323
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:48,515
You're right, sir. Absolutely right.
You save the pennies and dollars will grow.

324
00:33:48,675 --> 00:33:50,305
Likely you've growed many a dollar.

325
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:54,015
Mr. Bedloe, all my life I've been striving
to avoid becoming a millionaire.

326
00:33:54,185 --> 00:33:55,975
I think I've succeeded right well.

327
00:33:56,145 --> 00:33:58,775
I've got a little put away in the sock.
It'll stay there.

328
00:33:58,945 --> 00:34:01,315
Well, now, them's my sentiments exactly.

329
00:34:01,485 --> 00:34:04,025
Now, you, sir.
You look like a man of property.

330
00:34:04,195 --> 00:34:08,365
Now, if I was to bet, I'd say
you was worth, say, a thousand dollars.

331
00:34:08,535 --> 00:34:11,535
- Pretty close to the mark?
- Well, close, maybe.

332
00:35:07,175 --> 00:35:11,265
Colin, how much powder we got left?
- Don't be afraid, now, don't be afraid.

333
00:35:11,425 --> 00:35:13,185
Now, there's women and children here.

334
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:16,605
You gents wouldn't want us to have
to start shooting, now, would you?

335
00:35:17,355 --> 00:35:18,855
Be of good cheer, folks.

336
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:21,815
It's in our noble tradition
that we conquer the wilderness...

337
00:35:21,985 --> 00:35:24,405
...with nothing but our bare hands
and stout hearts.

338
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:28,485
You can build new rafts and sally forth
in the spirit of your forefathers.

339
00:35:28,655 --> 00:35:30,865
Why, you pious old scoundrel.

340
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:33,285
I'll see you burn.

341
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:42,545
Americans can't be whipped.

342
00:35:44,795 --> 00:35:48,045
It's him.
I knew he'd come back. It's him.

343
00:36:44,525 --> 00:36:48,155
Now let us pray.

344
00:36:49,365 --> 00:36:51,445
O Lord...

345
00:36:52,485 --> 00:36:55,285
...we thank thee for our salvation.

346
00:36:55,445 --> 00:36:59,125
We commit the souls of our dead
to thy gentle keeping.

347
00:36:59,745 --> 00:37:02,495
We pray for a speedy recovery
of our wounded.

348
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:08,255
And now another matter.

349
00:37:08,755 --> 00:37:10,845
O Lord...

350
00:37:11,215 --> 00:37:13,675
...without consulting with thee...

351
00:37:13,845 --> 00:37:19,225
...we have sent thy way some souls
whose evil ways passeth all understanding.

352
00:37:19,895 --> 00:37:22,815
We ask thee humbly to receive them.

353
00:37:23,605 --> 00:37:25,565
Whether you want them or not.

354
00:37:25,735 --> 00:37:27,235
Amen.

355
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,085
Now, it'll be a job...

356
00:37:50,255 --> 00:37:53,595
...but I guess I can patch her up
good enough to get to Pittsburgh.

357
00:37:54,135 --> 00:37:55,925
- Linus.
- Now, Eve...

358
00:37:56,095 --> 00:37:59,185
...let's just not talk any more about it.

359
00:37:59,345 --> 00:38:02,765
Linus, I'm telling you,
you don't know your own mind.

360
00:38:02,935 --> 00:38:04,975
Well, maybe so, maybe not.

361
00:38:05,145 --> 00:38:08,565
You know, I ain't saying
that you haven't been on my mind some.

362
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:10,235
I ain't saying that.

363
00:38:10,395 --> 00:38:13,735
But I still went to see the varmint
with that pirate girl.

364
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:16,945
I'll always be
going to see the varmint, Eve.

365
00:38:17,115 --> 00:38:21,115
I just ain't cut out
to be a farmer or a husband.

366
00:38:22,285 --> 00:38:25,335
Linus, I ain't never bringing up
the subject again...

367
00:38:25,495 --> 00:38:27,295
...whether ever I see you or not.

368
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:29,965
No, it's for the best.

369
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:33,175
I wish you Godspeed, Eve.

370
00:38:33,335 --> 00:38:38,055
And I ain't said that to anybody
for a long time.

371
00:39:11,715 --> 00:39:14,835
I can see rapids ahead, Pa. White water.

372
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:16,345
Look. Look.

373
00:39:16,505 --> 00:39:18,425
Oh, we must've taken the wrong fork.

374
00:39:18,595 --> 00:39:20,975
Let's beach her on this side.

375
00:39:21,135 --> 00:39:23,475
Harvey!

376
00:39:24,055 --> 00:39:25,555
Rapids!

377
00:39:25,725 --> 00:39:28,185
Rapids ahead! Beach her!

378
00:39:28,355 --> 00:39:29,685
Beach her!

379
00:39:33,145 --> 00:39:35,195
Hold her steady.

380
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:42,705
Rein!

381
00:39:43,035 --> 00:39:45,325
Pa, we're in the current!

382
00:39:48,955 --> 00:39:51,165
Get inside, Zeke.

383
00:39:51,335 --> 00:39:54,175
No, I don't wanna.

384
00:39:59,555 --> 00:40:02,095
Straighten her, Pa.

385
00:40:03,175 --> 00:40:05,055
Lilith!

386
00:40:24,535 --> 00:40:26,995
Hold it steady!

387
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:31,125
I can't!

388
00:41:46,575 --> 00:41:49,495
Go on. Go on to help Pa.

389
00:41:49,665 --> 00:41:51,495
I'll get it.

390
00:42:06,965 --> 00:42:10,015
Lilith! Lilith!

391
00:42:44,715 --> 00:42:47,385
Lie down!

392
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:49,305
Lie down!

393
00:43:25,295 --> 00:43:26,595
What happened?

394
00:43:26,755 --> 00:43:30,595
They took the wrong fork of the river
and they went over the falls.

395
00:43:30,765 --> 00:43:32,845
Did you happen to hear
the name of the family?

396
00:43:33,015 --> 00:43:36,645
Uh... Prescott, I think.
Something like that.

397
00:43:50,735 --> 00:43:52,825
As soon as they're buried decent...

398
00:43:52,995 --> 00:43:55,955
...I'm heading back East
on the first boat that comes along.

399
00:43:56,125 --> 00:44:00,165
And if you were in your right mind,
you would too.

400
00:44:29,315 --> 00:44:31,615
Oh, Linus.

401
00:45:55,735 --> 00:45:58,575
Would you walk with me a piece, Eve?

402
00:46:18,345 --> 00:46:19,515
Eve, I...

403
00:46:21,435 --> 00:46:26,725
Eve, all the time I was paddling down here
I was thinking...

404
00:46:26,895 --> 00:46:30,775
...if I found you alive, I'd...

405
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:34,695
Would you come
to Pittsburgh with me, Eve?

406
00:46:35,235 --> 00:46:37,445
Oh, Linus.

407
00:46:39,075 --> 00:46:41,285
I'm staying right here.

408
00:46:41,455 --> 00:46:44,455
I ain't moving a foot
one way or the other.

409
00:46:46,035 --> 00:46:48,415
Now, would you explain that a little?

410
00:46:50,415 --> 00:46:53,585
Ma and Pa,
they wanted a farm in the West...

411
00:46:53,755 --> 00:46:56,385
...and this is as far as they got.

412
00:46:57,305 --> 00:47:00,635
Seems to me this is where the Lord
wanted the farm to be.

413
00:47:00,805 --> 00:47:03,515
But your brother, Sam, he's bad hurt,
and winter's coming...

414
00:47:03,685 --> 00:47:06,105
There's no sense talking about it.
I'm gonna do it.

415
00:47:06,435 --> 00:47:08,815
Eve, you just ain't making much sense.

416
00:47:10,485 --> 00:47:14,485
Well, half the people that come West
don't make much sense, I reckon.

417
00:47:19,445 --> 00:47:21,115
All right.

418
00:47:21,575 --> 00:47:23,325
All right.

419
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:28,245
By golly, you're a strong-minded woman.

420
00:47:30,085 --> 00:47:34,505
I reckon I seen that varmint
for the last time.

421
00:48:20,385 --> 00:48:25,135
<i>The westward course was no smoother</i>
<i>than that of true love.</i>

422
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:29,725
<i>Not only the hard hand of nature</i>
<i>was against it, but the impediment of war.</i>

423
00:48:29,895 --> 00:48:33,435
<i>Trouble over land</i>
<i>smoldered along the Mexican border.</i>

424
00:48:33,605 --> 00:48:38,235
<i>Not all Americans were for war, including</i>
<i>Congressman Abe Lincoln of Illinois.</i>

425
00:48:38,405 --> 00:48:41,405
<i>But a war did break out,</i>
<i>and in the end...</i>

426
00:48:41,575 --> 00:48:45,405
<i>... vast new territories came into the Union</i>
<i>along with their rich Spanish names:</i>

427
00:48:45,575 --> 00:48:49,495
<i>Rio Grande, Santa Fe,</i>
<i>Albuquerque, El Paso.</i>

428
00:48:49,665 --> 00:48:52,625
<i>And most glittering of all, California...</i>

429
00:48:52,795 --> 00:48:57,505
<i>... named after a mythical island</i>
<i>of pearls and gold in a 15th-century novel.</i>

430
00:48:57,675 --> 00:49:00,505
<i>Here, in 1848...</i>

431
00:49:00,675 --> 00:49:04,215
<i>... at Sutter's Mill, a man found something</i>
<i>he wasn't even looking for...</i>

432
00:49:04,385 --> 00:49:05,845
<i>... at the bottom of a ditch.</i>

433
00:49:06,015 --> 00:49:09,145
<i>And the cry of his discovery was heard</i>
<i>clear across the continent...</i>

434
00:49:09,305 --> 00:49:11,055
<i>... in Boston, New York, Savannah...</i>

435
00:49:11,225 --> 00:49:14,735
<i>... and across the oceans</i>
<i>in London, Paris, Berlin.</i>

436
00:49:14,895 --> 00:49:21,115
<i>But nowhere was the clamor of gold</i>
<i>heard more eagerly than in St. Louis...</i>

437
00:49:21,275 --> 00:49:23,785
<i>... the busiest fur-trading center</i>
<i>in the world...</i>

438
00:49:23,945 --> 00:49:28,205
<i>... and the noisiest, bawdiest,</i>
<i>most uppity town west of New York.</i>

439
00:50:17,795 --> 00:50:19,415
I say there's no more than three.

440
00:50:19,795 --> 00:50:20,835
- Six.
- Six?

441
00:50:21,005 --> 00:50:23,095
It's that lace that fooled you. I say three.

442
00:50:23,255 --> 00:50:27,055
Watch him. I hear Cleve's an expert on
petticoats. Anyway, you can never prove it.

443
00:50:27,215 --> 00:50:29,265
We're going to be late
for that poker game.

444
00:50:29,425 --> 00:50:32,225
Look, I've just stuck you
for the most expensive dinner in St. Louis.

445
00:50:32,395 --> 00:50:36,355
I don't mind sticking you a bit deeper.
I'll lay you a hundred it's no less than six.

446
00:50:36,525 --> 00:50:38,855
- How will you prove it?
- Go backstage and find out.

447
00:50:39,025 --> 00:50:42,485
- If I go back and check with you.
- Fair enough.

448
00:50:49,745 --> 00:50:51,705
Second girl.

449
00:50:55,035 --> 00:50:57,085
- Miss Prescott? Miss Prescott?
- Later.

450
00:50:57,245 --> 00:50:59,585
It's rather important.

451
00:50:59,755 --> 00:51:01,335
It's always important.

452
00:51:01,505 --> 00:51:04,085
The older they are,
the more important it gets.

453
00:51:04,255 --> 00:51:06,845
Miss Prescott, please.
I am Hylan Seabury...

454
00:51:07,005 --> 00:51:10,095
...attorney in the matter
of Jonathan Brooks.

455
00:51:10,385 --> 00:51:12,265
He means nothing to you?

456
00:51:12,435 --> 00:51:13,725
That old goat?

457
00:51:13,895 --> 00:51:16,515
Well, you must've meant
something to him, Miss Prescott.

458
00:51:16,685 --> 00:51:18,435
- Why?
- You're included in his will.

459
00:51:18,605 --> 00:51:22,355
Of course, you have to make the trip
to California to claim the bequest.

460
00:51:22,525 --> 00:51:24,905
Well, now, I wouldn't go to California...

461
00:51:25,065 --> 00:51:27,985
...if John Jacob Astor left me
San Francisco.

462
00:51:28,155 --> 00:51:30,745
I don't think Mr. Astor
had holdings there, no.

463
00:51:30,905 --> 00:51:34,075
However, the yield from
Mr. Brooks, property is not to be scorned.

464
00:51:34,245 --> 00:51:38,545
- Yield of what?
- Gold, Miss Prescott. Gold.

465
00:51:38,705 --> 00:51:40,625
- Gold?
- Precisely.

466
00:51:40,795 --> 00:51:46,465
You own a gold mine, Miss Prescott.
It yielded $3500 the very first week.

467
00:51:46,635 --> 00:51:48,755
Gold mine?

468
00:51:51,095 --> 00:51:53,685
Well. Well, I...

469
00:51:53,845 --> 00:51:56,605
That sweet old goat.

470
00:51:59,895 --> 00:52:01,895
For heavens...

471
00:52:13,365 --> 00:52:15,115
Well.

472
00:52:15,285 --> 00:52:16,955
This is an unexpected pleasure.

473
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:19,375
- Where's the money?
- Money?

474
00:52:19,535 --> 00:52:20,625
Money?

475
00:52:20,795 --> 00:52:24,715
Oh, yes. You're referring, of course,
to our little agreement.

476
00:52:25,465 --> 00:52:27,715
One hundred to start you off...

477
00:52:27,885 --> 00:52:29,675
...and my share of the winnings.

478
00:52:31,135 --> 00:52:35,765
Well, I'm somewhat embarrassed to report
that the hundred no longer exists.

479
00:52:37,805 --> 00:52:39,685
That $100, I assure you...

480
00:52:39,855 --> 00:52:44,435
...will turn out to be the best investment
you have ever made.

481
00:52:44,605 --> 00:52:46,525
I have plans, gentlemen...

482
00:52:46,695 --> 00:52:49,485
...beyond your wildest dreams.

483
00:52:49,655 --> 00:52:53,495
I'm gonna earn you
a piece of a gold mine.

484
00:52:53,825 --> 00:52:55,955
Gold mine.

485
00:52:56,325 --> 00:52:58,165
You ain't gonna earn nothing.

486
00:52:58,325 --> 00:53:01,125
You ain't gonna be nothing,
you ain't gonna do nothing...

487
00:53:01,285 --> 00:53:03,545
...unless we get that 100 back
by the morning.

488
00:53:03,705 --> 00:53:06,005
Grimes, you don't mean that.

489
00:53:06,165 --> 00:53:10,005
- You're gonna kill off the golden goose.
- Call it what you want, mister.

490
00:53:10,175 --> 00:53:12,095
We'll be waiting.

491
00:53:34,535 --> 00:53:39,785
<i>Independence, Missouri, was the jump-off</i>
<i>point for emigrants from everywhere.</i>

492
00:53:39,955 --> 00:53:44,375
<i>Solid, God-fearing families</i>
<i>bound for the farmlands of Oregon...</i>

493
00:53:44,545 --> 00:53:49,715
<i>... and get-rich-quick adventurers</i>
<i>racing for the gold of California.</i>

494
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:54,055
Try it.

495
00:53:59,225 --> 00:54:02,055
- You got a wagon, I suppose?
- I can get one.

496
00:54:02,225 --> 00:54:03,475
And a team to pull it?

497
00:54:03,645 --> 00:54:05,025
I can get everything I need.

498
00:54:05,855 --> 00:54:09,235
- You got a husband?
- I'm single, Mr. Morgan.

499
00:54:09,395 --> 00:54:11,695
No traveling companion?

500
00:54:11,865 --> 00:54:15,035
- No, I'm traveling alone.
- Not on my wagon train.

501
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:18,705
Alone and single brings out
the deviltry in a man.

502
00:54:18,865 --> 00:54:22,205
Gets them all worked up
and they're wild enough already.

503
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:24,745
I intend to keep to myself, Mr. Morgan.

504
00:54:25,915 --> 00:54:28,165
Oh, woman of your sort?

505
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:33,135
One day you'd find yourself in trouble, and
there'd be hell to pay just figuring out who.

506
00:54:33,295 --> 00:54:36,715
What did you say, Mr. Morgan?

507
00:54:37,015 --> 00:54:41,765
Well, now, ain't you the feisty one.
I like spirit in a woman.

508
00:54:41,935 --> 00:54:46,225
Hey, you got a pretty face
under that powder too.

509
00:54:46,395 --> 00:54:50,195
And a fine, sturdy body
under them clothes, I wager.

510
00:54:52,275 --> 00:54:55,275
There's a woman named Clegg,
Aggie Clegg.

511
00:54:55,445 --> 00:54:57,485
Why don't you go see her?

512
00:55:05,415 --> 00:55:07,205
Thanks.

513
00:55:16,175 --> 00:55:18,255
I told you, no.

514
00:55:18,425 --> 00:55:21,305
I was hoping to make this trip
with a husband.

515
00:55:21,475 --> 00:55:22,885
Nearly got one last week.

516
00:55:23,305 --> 00:55:27,065
Look, I hear there's 40 men
to every woman in California.

517
00:55:27,225 --> 00:55:30,815
- Miss Clegg, I'd be willing to pay you.
- I don't need money.

518
00:55:30,985 --> 00:55:33,315
I need a man.

519
00:55:34,315 --> 00:55:36,445
Any man.

520
00:55:43,155 --> 00:55:45,245
Morning, ladies.

521
00:55:45,825 --> 00:55:47,915
Beautiful morning.

522
00:55:48,495 --> 00:55:52,375
Would you, by any chance,
happen to be Miss Lily Prescott?

523
00:55:52,715 --> 00:55:55,135
Not unless you got a big imagination.

524
00:55:55,295 --> 00:55:57,845
Then you must be the lady in question.

525
00:55:58,005 --> 00:56:00,425
Cleve Van Valen, Miss Prescott,
at your service.

526
00:56:00,595 --> 00:56:03,345
At your every command
from here to California.

527
00:56:03,515 --> 00:56:04,725
Well, thank you.

528
00:56:04,885 --> 00:56:07,105
But whatever you're offering,
I don't need.

529
00:56:08,435 --> 00:56:09,685
Perhaps you don't understand.

530
00:56:11,025 --> 00:56:14,105
Yes, I do.
I know a tinhorn when I see one.

531
00:56:14,275 --> 00:56:15,695
Miss Prescott.

532
00:56:15,855 --> 00:56:18,905
I'm offering you an honest day's work
for an honest day's pay.

533
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:22,695
Goodbye, Mr. Van Valen. Goodbye.

534
00:56:23,745 --> 00:56:26,415
Well, it's been a pleasure to meet you,
Miss Clegg.

535
00:56:26,575 --> 00:56:32,085
May I say I have never seen a woman
with more beautiful hair.

536
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,375
What a prize catch it'll make...

537
00:56:34,545 --> 00:56:37,335
...hanging from the waist of an Indian.

538
00:56:37,715 --> 00:56:42,385
Beauty alone in the wilderness,
and who's to protect you?

539
00:56:42,555 --> 00:56:43,635
No one.

540
00:56:43,805 --> 00:56:48,935
Not one person
won't be looking after himself.

541
00:56:50,725 --> 00:56:52,315
Well...

542
00:56:54,275 --> 00:56:57,985
Good day, ladies. Good day.

543
00:57:01,825 --> 00:57:05,075
Nobody ever said that to me before.

544
00:57:05,245 --> 00:57:07,035
What?

545
00:57:07,365 --> 00:57:11,245
That I had such... Such beautiful hair.

546
00:57:14,085 --> 00:57:16,255
You know something?

547
00:57:16,415 --> 00:57:20,925
I got a hunch you're gonna draw men
like fish to the bait.

548
00:57:21,095 --> 00:57:25,015
Maybe I can catch one of them
while they swim by.

549
00:57:25,765 --> 00:57:28,225
You got yourself a partner.

550
00:57:28,385 --> 00:57:29,805
Thank you.

551
00:57:31,435 --> 00:57:33,355
How's it, men?

552
00:57:33,815 --> 00:57:37,605
It's all clear through here. Look for
a little mudhole up through the next pocket.

553
00:57:37,775 --> 00:57:39,775
How far?
Oh, maybe half a quarter.

554
00:57:39,945 --> 00:57:42,945
Well, thanks.
Looks a little higher up on that ridge.

555
00:57:43,115 --> 00:57:46,995
There's a water hole up there
about half a mile. Let's head for it.

556
00:57:54,335 --> 00:57:57,045
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.

557
00:58:01,135 --> 00:58:03,465
Hey, you're driving.

558
00:58:03,885 --> 00:58:06,715
I was raised on a farm.

559
00:58:09,935 --> 00:58:11,595
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.

560
00:58:50,095 --> 00:58:51,265
Hey, Aggie?

561
00:58:52,845 --> 00:58:55,765
- Can you use these?
Yeah, sure.

562
00:58:55,935 --> 00:58:57,775
Thanks.

563
00:59:10,535 --> 00:59:12,035
Ladies.

564
00:59:21,415 --> 00:59:23,295
At your service.

565
00:59:23,465 --> 00:59:25,045
I thought we'd gotten rid of you.

566
00:59:25,215 --> 00:59:28,965
Well, I just couldn't bear to think of
you two making this trip without my help.

567
00:59:29,135 --> 00:59:33,015
If I was to hear later on that something
happened to you, I'd never forgive myself.

568
00:59:33,185 --> 00:59:34,645
You came 100 miles alone?

569
00:59:34,805 --> 00:59:39,315
Well, I had no way of counting the miles,
Mr. Morgan, but I'll take your word for it.

570
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:41,735
Well, you've got another 100, mister.
Going back.

571
00:59:41,895 --> 00:59:45,065
I told you, when a wagon breaks down,
I want men who can fix it...

572
00:59:45,235 --> 00:59:46,985
...not bet how long it'll take.

573
00:59:47,155 --> 00:59:48,825
You don't mean you'll turn me out?

574
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,575
Pass me adrift at the mercy
of savage Indians?

575
00:59:51,745 --> 00:59:53,915
If you don't get moving,
I'll cast you adrift...

576
00:59:54,075 --> 00:59:56,875
Uh-uh-uh.
I appeal to your sporting instinct, sir.

577
00:59:57,035 --> 01:00:00,335
I'm prepared to wager you
that I stay with this train.

578
01:00:00,505 --> 01:00:03,415
- Well, you got a wager.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

579
01:00:03,585 --> 01:00:05,425
The fact is, I hired this man.

580
01:00:05,585 --> 01:00:08,045
We'll put up his stake.

581
01:00:10,255 --> 01:00:12,095
Is that right, Miss Prescott?

582
01:00:12,265 --> 01:00:14,805
If Miss Clegg says so.

583
01:00:25,485 --> 01:00:27,195
Ma'am...

584
01:00:27,695 --> 01:00:29,445
...I'll be forever grateful.

585
01:00:33,195 --> 01:00:36,495
Now, I'll unpack my gear.

586
01:00:39,455 --> 01:00:42,125
Agatha, have you gone crazy?

587
01:00:42,295 --> 01:00:45,295
He says he's a man
wanting to do an honest day's work.

588
01:00:46,465 --> 01:00:49,635
And he'll do it. I can promise you that.

589
01:00:50,505 --> 01:00:53,595
Hey, you men on that last wagon,
keep up that slack.

590
01:00:53,765 --> 01:00:55,555
Keep it up.

591
01:00:55,975 --> 01:00:59,395
Get that team moving.
Keep them moving there.

592
01:01:01,975 --> 01:01:04,735
Don't let those lines sag.

593
01:01:05,945 --> 01:01:08,355
Keep them up. Keep them up.

594
01:01:12,025 --> 01:01:14,535
Keep those teams moving.

595
01:01:16,365 --> 01:01:18,415
Keep them moving.

596
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:21,915
Don't let those lines sag.

597
01:01:22,335 --> 01:01:25,545
You, on that middle team,
keep them moving.

598
01:01:35,515 --> 01:01:37,135
Get in there.
Over here, Pa.

599
01:01:37,305 --> 01:01:39,055
Get in there.

600
01:01:39,975 --> 01:01:43,685
Get in there. Get in there, mule.

601
01:02:17,055 --> 01:02:21,475
I'm just overwhelmed by all this attention,
Miss Prescott.

602
01:02:28,895 --> 01:02:30,985
I want to confess...

603
01:02:31,155 --> 01:02:36,075
...I have lied about
why I wanted to work for you.

604
01:02:36,235 --> 01:02:37,945
I know.

605
01:02:38,905 --> 01:02:42,495
The real reason is, of course,
that I'm in love with you.

606
01:02:42,665 --> 01:02:43,995
No.

607
01:02:44,165 --> 01:02:45,455
It's the truth.

608
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:51,465
From the first moment I saw you,
I've known that I couldn't live without you.

609
01:02:52,215 --> 01:02:57,265
Well, I'd hate to be the cause
of your death, Mr. Van Valen.

610
01:02:57,425 --> 01:02:59,555
I don't speak lightly, Miss Prescott.

611
01:02:59,725 --> 01:03:04,015
I'm prepared to assume
the responsibilities of a faithful husband.

612
01:03:04,185 --> 01:03:07,475
Oh, and are you ready to assume
the responsibilities...

613
01:03:07,645 --> 01:03:10,065
...of my property too, Mr. Van Valen?

614
01:03:11,105 --> 01:03:12,985
Really?

615
01:03:13,155 --> 01:03:14,775
What kind of property?

616
01:03:15,905 --> 01:03:17,945
Gold, Mr. Van Valen.

617
01:03:18,115 --> 01:03:21,205
Gold by the ton, from what I understand.

618
01:03:21,365 --> 01:03:25,375
Bright, yellow, shiny gold.

619
01:03:26,785 --> 01:03:30,125
Why, I had no idea.

620
01:03:31,465 --> 01:03:34,675
- I'm sure you hadn't.
- Miss Prescott, I really mean...

621
01:03:34,835 --> 01:03:39,715
Here comes Agatha.
If you must propose to somebody...

622
01:03:39,885 --> 01:03:42,515
...I suggest you get on your knees to her.

623
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:46,225
Besides, she has beautiful hair.

624
01:03:47,645 --> 01:03:49,525
Look at them.

625
01:03:49,685 --> 01:03:52,525
Think they was getting ready
to bury somebody.

626
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:55,525
Ain't we worn down enough as it is?

627
01:03:55,695 --> 01:03:59,285
Well, let's wake them up.

628
01:04:02,325 --> 01:04:03,825
Listen, everybody.

629
01:05:23,195 --> 01:05:26,495
That's the spirit! That's the way to feel!

630
01:05:35,255 --> 01:05:37,965
Oh, hiya, Mr. Morgan!

631
01:05:50,805 --> 01:05:53,435
Aggie. For lunch.

632
01:05:53,605 --> 01:05:57,025
Thanks. Nice nest of fish.

633
01:06:04,325 --> 01:06:06,655
What is it, Mr. Morgan?

634
01:06:06,905 --> 01:06:09,785
Miss Prescott, I've been thinking.

635
01:06:10,785 --> 01:06:12,455
Oh?

636
01:06:14,495 --> 01:06:17,965
Wet or dry, you're the handsomest woman
I ever did see.

637
01:06:18,125 --> 01:06:20,795
Spirit and a fine, sturdy body.

638
01:06:21,135 --> 01:06:23,635
It's a noble combination, Miss Prescott.

639
01:06:23,795 --> 01:06:27,975
Why, for you, childbearing would
come as easy as rolling off a log.

640
01:06:29,935 --> 01:06:33,725
Well, I think I'd rather roll off a log,
Mr. Morgan.

641
01:06:34,475 --> 01:06:36,975
Ma'am, I'm telling you,
you got the build for it.

642
01:06:37,775 --> 01:06:40,195
I want you for my wife.

643
01:06:40,485 --> 01:06:43,115
I've got a cattle ranch
just below the Merced.

644
01:06:43,945 --> 01:06:46,405
I'll be settling down there, fit and proper.

645
01:06:47,945 --> 01:06:50,955
I'm sure you're very fit and proper,
Mr. Morgan.

646
01:06:51,665 --> 01:06:53,205
Well, then...

647
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:56,245
...you just couldn't do no better
than marrying me.

648
01:06:56,625 --> 01:07:00,165
Why, we'd have ourselves a fine family
in no time at all.

649
01:07:01,545 --> 01:07:03,795
I believe that.

650
01:07:04,715 --> 01:07:06,595
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan...

651
01:07:07,765 --> 01:07:09,475
...but I can't accept your proposal.

652
01:07:09,635 --> 01:07:11,185
Why not?

653
01:07:11,935 --> 01:07:16,265
Well, a woman likes to hear something
a little more inviting.

654
01:07:17,525 --> 01:07:20,525
Well, ain't that what I've been doing?
Inviting you?

655
01:07:21,145 --> 01:07:23,315
Inviting you to share my life,
Miss Prescott.

656
01:07:26,735 --> 01:07:29,325
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan.

657
01:07:30,865 --> 01:07:32,955
It's something else, ain't it?

658
01:07:33,915 --> 01:07:36,205
Must be something else nagging at you.

659
01:07:37,285 --> 01:07:39,125
Well...

660
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:42,585
...I don't aim to let it stop me,
Miss Prescott.

661
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:45,675
You can count on that.

662
01:07:45,845 --> 01:07:47,925
What did he want?

663
01:07:49,055 --> 01:07:50,925
Children.

664
01:07:51,345 --> 01:07:52,885
Children?

665
01:07:53,055 --> 01:07:55,435
Well, I'll be...

666
01:07:55,595 --> 01:07:58,895
Why didn't he come shopping
at the right store?

667
01:08:41,975 --> 01:08:44,485
- I'll take a look.
- Well.

668
01:08:44,645 --> 01:08:46,815
Now, gentlemen, are we pikers?

669
01:08:46,985 --> 01:08:50,025
I'm gonna see
and I'm gonna raise this fine pistol...

670
01:08:50,195 --> 01:08:53,075
...London-made and loaded for bear.

671
01:08:53,365 --> 01:08:55,955
I'll take part of that bet.

672
01:09:02,545 --> 01:09:05,585
I told you I wouldn't stand
for you fleecing any...

673
01:09:08,635 --> 01:09:09,715
Cheyennes.

674
01:09:10,965 --> 01:09:13,385
There's too many to fight.
We'll have to run for it.

675
01:09:13,555 --> 01:09:15,135
You can't outrun them with wagons.

676
01:09:15,305 --> 01:09:17,515
The minute you get moving,
cut your teams loose.

677
01:09:17,685 --> 01:09:19,605
- Have you gone crazy?
- Go on, get moving.

678
01:09:19,765 --> 01:09:21,815
Chances are they want our stock
more than us.

679
01:09:21,975 --> 01:09:24,895
Now, you're a gambler, ain't you?
All right, let's get moving.

680
01:09:41,835 --> 01:09:44,045
Keep them closed up there.

681
01:09:55,425 --> 01:09:57,765
I don't know how to unhook them.

682
01:11:02,075 --> 01:11:03,745
Cleve, watch out!

683
01:11:38,615 --> 01:11:39,695
Cleve!

684
01:12:05,935 --> 01:12:08,645
Joe, pick me up.

685
01:12:55,025 --> 01:12:57,155
We'll be moving at daybreak.

686
01:12:57,605 --> 01:13:00,485
I'll take a few men,
see if we can find him.

687
01:13:00,655 --> 01:13:03,245
Give him a decent, Christian burial.

688
01:13:10,835 --> 01:13:13,915
Someone's coming! Someone's coming!

689
01:13:57,755 --> 01:14:01,755
Well, I can let you have this rig for a dollar
a day, and I'll give you a good team.

690
01:14:01,925 --> 01:14:03,965
- Pick it up in the morning.
- That'll be fine.

691
01:14:04,135 --> 01:14:06,265
Could you tell me the way
to the Brooks claim?

692
01:14:06,425 --> 01:14:08,885
Well, the claims are down by the river.

693
01:14:09,055 --> 01:14:12,805
- Which road should I take?
- Only one road. Along the river.

694
01:14:12,975 --> 01:14:14,525
- Thank you.
- Sure welcome.

695
01:14:29,075 --> 01:14:31,455
We're looking for a Mr. Huggins.

696
01:14:31,625 --> 01:14:33,495
You found him.

697
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:40,965
This is Miss Lilith Prescott.

698
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:42,385
I figured.

699
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:44,805
They told me you was a real looker.

700
01:14:44,965 --> 01:14:49,225
Yup. It's all here for you.
Just the way Mr. Brooks staked it out.

701
01:14:49,385 --> 01:14:51,135
Must've had 20 men working on it.

702
01:14:51,305 --> 01:14:54,145
Well, where are they now?
Who's digging the gold?

703
01:14:54,515 --> 01:14:59,145
Gold? I ain't never seen a better grade
since I come here with Millie.

704
01:14:59,525 --> 01:15:01,105
It was just a pocket, though.

705
01:15:01,275 --> 01:15:04,575
The whole shebang, nothing but a pocket.

706
01:15:04,735 --> 01:15:08,405
Oh, we cleared 4200
before it played out.

707
01:15:08,575 --> 01:15:10,785
Now, about that 4200...

708
01:15:10,955 --> 01:15:13,455
Mr. Brooks, he spent three
before his heart give out.

709
01:15:13,625 --> 01:15:16,495
I put up 600 for a brass-handled casket.

710
01:15:16,665 --> 01:15:20,295
I figure the rest you owe me
for sitting on your claim.

711
01:15:24,005 --> 01:15:27,175
Oh, miss, I mean, that's only fair, ain't it?

712
01:15:27,345 --> 01:15:29,555
I mean, wouldn't you...?

713
01:15:36,185 --> 01:15:38,355
Funny pair, all right.

714
01:16:00,415 --> 01:16:03,175
How about you boys?
Come and see the brand-new attraction.

715
01:16:03,335 --> 01:16:06,045
It's exciting and sensational.
Step right in, gentlemen.

716
01:17:22,795 --> 01:17:24,295
Miss Prescott?

717
01:17:24,455 --> 01:17:25,875
Hello, Mr. Morgan.

718
01:17:26,045 --> 01:17:30,595
I'd invite you in, but it's a little cramped.

719
01:17:42,225 --> 01:17:44,395
This is no life for a fine woman like you.

720
01:17:48,065 --> 01:17:51,065
I heard your mine was played out.

721
01:17:52,075 --> 01:17:54,115
But where's your fancy friend?

722
01:17:54,285 --> 01:17:56,075
Cleve?

723
01:17:56,655 --> 01:18:00,125
Last I heard, he was in Hangtown.

724
01:18:00,995 --> 01:18:03,835
You mean that no-good went off
and left you?

725
01:18:06,505 --> 01:18:08,675
He went off and left me.

726
01:18:10,675 --> 01:18:13,465
But I don't agree that he's no good.

727
01:18:14,095 --> 01:18:16,345
Cleve is Cleve, that's all.

728
01:18:19,555 --> 01:18:22,685
You're a perplexing woman,
Miss Prescott.

729
01:18:23,355 --> 01:18:25,815
When a skunk needs killing...

730
01:18:26,145 --> 01:18:29,025
...well, it ain't enough just to say
a skunk's a skunk.

731
01:18:29,195 --> 01:18:30,945
Mr. Morgan...

732
01:18:31,565 --> 01:18:35,075
...all my life I've wanted
to marry a rich husband.

733
01:18:35,865 --> 01:18:39,535
Can I blame Cleve for wanting
to marry a rich wife?

734
01:18:41,415 --> 01:18:44,625
Both of us may have been born
for the poorhouse...

735
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:48,415
...but we're not the kind to like it.

736
01:18:49,665 --> 01:18:52,675
Do you believe all this you've been saying,
or is it just words?

737
01:18:52,835 --> 01:18:53,965
Now, tell me the truth.

738
01:18:57,715 --> 01:18:59,635
The truth is...

739
01:18:59,805 --> 01:19:03,895
...Cleve and I couldn't live alone
just on love.

740
01:19:04,055 --> 01:19:05,645
Not for five minutes.

741
01:19:06,265 --> 01:19:11,775
Then you've answered the question I've
been asking for better than 2000 miles.

742
01:19:12,905 --> 01:19:15,235
I got the biggest ranch you ever did see.

743
01:19:15,405 --> 01:19:18,325
You can't ride across it in a day.

744
01:19:18,825 --> 01:19:21,915
That land's gonna mean money
sooner than you think.

745
01:19:23,535 --> 01:19:25,835
You want a rich husband...

746
01:19:27,125 --> 01:19:28,375
...you're looking at him.

747
01:19:36,345 --> 01:19:39,765
There ain't a blessed thing you have to do
except mind the kids.

748
01:19:43,095 --> 01:19:44,975
I'm sorry.

749
01:19:46,265 --> 01:19:48,225
Not now.

750
01:19:48,525 --> 01:19:50,185
Not ever.

751
01:19:57,525 --> 01:19:59,575
What a waste.

752
01:20:02,205 --> 01:20:04,825
Someone put together like you.

753
01:20:10,915 --> 01:20:12,585
Aggie.

754
01:20:16,135 --> 01:20:20,805
<i>Those who struck it rich wanted</i>
<i>all the pleasures that money could buy.</i>

755
01:20:20,965 --> 01:20:23,305
<i>And there were plenty to sell to them.</i>

756
01:20:23,475 --> 01:20:27,895
<i>Even the Sacramento riverboats</i>
<i>took on luxury goods.</i>

757
01:20:50,705 --> 01:20:52,625
I'll see it.

758
01:20:54,215 --> 01:20:56,085
It's up to you.

759
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:58,715
Betting?

760
01:21:01,885 --> 01:21:03,925
What's the matter with you?

761
01:21:05,435 --> 01:21:07,145
- I'm checking out.
- Checking out?

762
01:21:07,305 --> 01:21:09,185
What's the matter with him?

763
01:22:39,275 --> 01:22:42,275
Lily, I got to talk to you.

764
01:22:45,235 --> 01:22:48,455
I found myself throwing in
a winning hand.

765
01:22:48,615 --> 01:22:51,825
Well, I just never thought
I'd do that for any girl.

766
01:22:51,995 --> 01:22:53,625
Lily.

767
01:22:54,785 --> 01:22:57,955
How'd you like to hook up
with a no-good gambler?

768
01:23:02,795 --> 01:23:06,005
Oh, hon, we are on our way.
I got $1200 right here.

769
01:23:06,175 --> 01:23:08,515
- What'll we do, open a gambling house?
- No.

770
01:23:09,175 --> 01:23:11,385
A married man should spend
his evenings at home.

771
01:23:11,555 --> 01:23:13,725
Then we'll open a music hall
in San Francisco.

772
01:23:13,895 --> 01:23:15,395
- No.
- I can still sing and dance.

773
01:23:15,565 --> 01:23:18,525
No. A married woman should
spend her evenings at home.

774
01:23:18,685 --> 01:23:22,775
- But we can't sit at home on $1200 for...
- Lily.

775
01:23:22,945 --> 01:23:25,365
Have you seen San Francisco?

776
01:23:25,525 --> 01:23:29,195
It's ugly, and it's small,
and it's full of fleas.

777
01:23:29,365 --> 01:23:31,455
And it burns down
about every five minutes...

778
01:23:31,615 --> 01:23:36,495
...but each time they keep on rebuilding it
a little bigger and better than before.

779
01:23:36,665 --> 01:23:40,665
It's alive and kicking
and nothing can stop it.

780
01:23:40,835 --> 01:23:43,795
And it makes you
wanna build something too.

781
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:45,925
A railroad.

782
01:23:46,095 --> 01:23:48,215
A steamship line.

783
01:23:48,385 --> 01:23:50,975
Something to help the baby grow.

784
01:23:51,135 --> 01:23:53,645
Cleve, on $1200?

785
01:23:53,805 --> 01:23:57,355
We could start out
with a wagon or a rowboat.

786
01:23:57,515 --> 01:24:00,815
With the help of the devil,
I'll bet we make it.

787
01:29:43,575 --> 01:29:48,495
<i>Young America was not only</i>
<i>a union of East and West.</i>

788
01:29:48,665 --> 01:29:51,285
<i>There were North and South too.</i>

789
01:29:51,455 --> 01:29:54,835
<i>And between them,</i>
<i>the bonds were weakening.</i>

790
01:29:55,005 --> 01:29:58,255
<i>Mr. Lincoln, now retired</i>
<i>from Congress and practicing law...</i>

791
01:29:58,425 --> 01:30:00,715
<i>... realized that the South would fight...</i>

792
01:30:00,885 --> 01:30:05,055
<i>... to mold the new and</i>
<i>uncommitted territories to its own image.</i>

793
01:30:05,305 --> 01:30:07,685
<i>Still two years from the presidency...</i>

794
01:30:07,845 --> 01:30:11,355
<i>... he pleaded that the free West</i>
<i>be allowed to remain free...</i>

795
01:30:11,515 --> 01:30:14,725
<i>... and warned of the hazards</i>
<i>of a house divided against itself.</i>

796
01:30:15,605 --> 01:30:19,565
<i>But the South,</i>
<i>seeing its power and influence wane...</i>

797
01:30:19,735 --> 01:30:24,365
<i>... struggled against the inevitable</i>
<i>in dozens of Western towns.</i>

798
01:30:24,535 --> 01:30:29,865
<i>And slowly, the bitter seeds of civil war</i>
<i>took root.</i>

799
01:31:06,445 --> 01:31:08,405
Howdy, Ms. Rawlings.

800
01:31:11,325 --> 01:31:13,785
Whoa, Rosebud, whoa.

801
01:31:14,665 --> 01:31:18,505
Say, Mr. Peterson,
what's that suit you got on?

802
01:31:18,665 --> 01:31:22,835
Uniform, Mrs. Rawlings. A uniform.

803
01:31:23,005 --> 01:31:25,805
Our militia company was sworn in...

804
01:31:25,965 --> 01:31:29,765
...and I'm Corporal Peterson now,
Ohio Volunteers.

805
01:31:30,305 --> 01:31:32,975
You won't be seeing me for a spell.

806
01:31:33,555 --> 01:31:37,355
Hey, I got a letter for you,
from way out in California.

807
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:40,275
It must be from my sister, Lilith.

808
01:31:44,315 --> 01:31:46,485
"Dear Eve..."

809
01:31:50,955 --> 01:31:53,455
Mr. Peterson, could you wait a minute?

810
01:31:53,615 --> 01:31:55,535
I wanna answer this right away.

811
01:31:55,995 --> 01:31:57,455
Zeb?

812
01:31:57,625 --> 01:31:59,455
Zeb, come on down here.

813
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:03,675
Well, we was hoping
that Zeb might be going with us.

814
01:32:03,835 --> 01:32:06,885
His pa went when the first bugle blew.

815
01:32:07,045 --> 01:32:08,255
Ain't one enough?

816
01:32:09,715 --> 01:32:11,135
Hi, corporal.

817
01:32:13,225 --> 01:32:16,185
Jeremiah, get Mr. Peterson
some buttermilk.

818
01:32:16,355 --> 01:32:18,645
Buttermilk.

819
01:32:29,575 --> 01:32:31,405
It's from your aunt Lilith.

820
01:32:31,575 --> 01:32:35,785
She says there ain't no war out in California
and they don't expect there'll be one.

821
01:32:36,875 --> 01:32:38,835
"Business is brisk.

822
01:32:38,995 --> 01:32:42,505
Many opportunities
for an energetic young man."

823
01:32:42,665 --> 01:32:45,925
There's talk of building a railroad east.

824
01:32:46,085 --> 01:32:49,135
"Cleve has hopes of getting in
on the ground floor.

825
01:32:49,965 --> 01:32:52,555
We would welcome Zeb
if he wants to come."

826
01:32:52,725 --> 01:32:56,645
Ma, did you write her about me?

827
01:32:57,265 --> 01:33:00,225
- Not exactly.
- Now, did you?

828
01:33:00,395 --> 01:33:04,105
I told her you didn't like farming
any better than your pa did.

829
01:33:04,275 --> 01:33:07,275
Ma, you got the wrong idea
about this war.

830
01:33:07,445 --> 01:33:10,195
It ain't gonna be so bad, is it, corporal?

831
01:33:10,365 --> 01:33:12,325
You know Pa's having the time of his life.

832
01:33:12,495 --> 01:33:15,285
Now, Ms. Rawlings,
I got it from the captain himself...

833
01:33:15,455 --> 01:33:18,915
...that we ain't gonna be gone
no time at all.

834
01:33:20,665 --> 01:33:23,085
Pa left it up to you whether I go or not.

835
01:33:23,255 --> 01:33:24,875
But you know what he really felt.

836
01:33:25,045 --> 01:33:28,835
Ms. Rawlings, there ain't much glory
in tromping behind a plow.

837
01:33:29,925 --> 01:33:33,595
Reckon there's no hurry
in answering this letter.

838
01:33:34,135 --> 01:33:36,095
Thank you for waiting.

839
01:33:38,345 --> 01:33:40,265
You mean I can go?

840
01:33:41,935 --> 01:33:44,605
Oh, there'll be things to do.

841
01:33:46,235 --> 01:33:47,815
Ma...

842
01:33:49,775 --> 01:33:54,325
Gotta get your underwear washed
and your socks darned.

843
01:33:56,495 --> 01:33:59,495
Do they give you one of them suits?

844
01:33:59,665 --> 01:34:02,415
One of them uniforms?

845
01:34:02,875 --> 01:34:04,955
I reckon.

846
01:34:06,295 --> 01:34:09,005
Might not give you no shirts, though.

847
01:34:09,175 --> 01:34:12,045
Take that one off, I'll wash it for you.

848
01:34:12,595 --> 01:34:15,635
I got the others washed,
they aren't ironed yet.

849
01:34:16,845 --> 01:34:18,515
Mother, I...

850
01:34:21,685 --> 01:34:23,725
Why'd you call me that?

851
01:34:23,895 --> 01:34:26,565
It's always been "Ma" before.

852
01:34:28,945 --> 01:34:30,655
I don't know.

853
01:34:31,195 --> 01:34:33,235
All of a sudden...

854
01:34:33,735 --> 01:34:37,075
..."Ma" didn't seem enough somehow.

855
01:34:55,635 --> 01:34:58,055
Hey, cowpoke!

856
01:35:51,065 --> 01:35:53,445
Go on back, dog!

857
01:35:54,025 --> 01:35:55,735
Go on!

858
01:36:18,805 --> 01:36:21,135
What could I do, Pa?

859
01:36:21,305 --> 01:36:23,725
He's Linus, boy.

860
01:36:26,305 --> 01:36:29,275
Always was more Linus, blood.

861
01:36:32,315 --> 01:36:35,405
I guess that's why I love him so much.

862
01:36:40,615 --> 01:36:43,455
But you've gotta help me pray, Pa.

863
01:36:48,165 --> 01:36:50,165
Help me pray.

864
01:37:27,995 --> 01:37:29,165
Ohio.

865
01:37:29,335 --> 01:37:32,205
Battery B, Ohio!

866
01:37:32,375 --> 01:37:34,295
- Let's go!
On the double, come on!

867
01:37:34,465 --> 01:37:38,715
Anybody here from the 12th Michigan?

868
01:37:38,885 --> 01:37:42,465
Thirty-sixth Indiana.

869
01:37:44,885 --> 01:37:48,845
<i>Evening of April 6th, 1862.</i>

870
01:37:49,055 --> 01:37:52,185
<i>The guns that had roared all day</i>
<i>fell silent...</i>

871
01:37:52,355 --> 01:37:57,945
<i>... around a little church</i>
<i>called the Shiloh Meeting House.</i>

872
01:37:58,105 --> 01:38:01,985
<i>Many a man had met his God</i>
<i>that Sunday...</i>

873
01:38:02,235 --> 01:38:03,825
<i>... but not in church.</i>

874
01:38:12,285 --> 01:38:14,205
You wasted your time, men. He's dead.

875
01:38:14,375 --> 01:38:18,625
- But, doc, this here is Captain Rawlings.
- Captain Linus Rawlings.

876
01:38:18,795 --> 01:38:21,675
- Take him out.
- Keep moving, men.

877
01:38:30,225 --> 01:38:33,895
- Why can't you look where you're going?
- I'm sorry, soldier.

878
01:38:34,065 --> 01:38:35,815
Watch it.

879
01:38:42,615 --> 01:38:44,825
Saw. Brandy.

880
01:38:44,985 --> 01:38:46,155
Chloroform.

881
01:38:47,405 --> 01:38:50,575
Get it all down. Come on, all of it.

882
01:38:52,415 --> 01:38:55,085
Come on, we're just in the way here.

883
01:38:59,425 --> 01:39:04,345
<i>It had been the bloodiest day</i>
<i>of the war on the Western front.</i>

884
01:39:04,635 --> 01:39:10,225
<i>In the morning, it had looked like</i>
<i>a Confederate victory, but by nightfall...</i>

885
01:39:10,385 --> 01:39:15,145
<i>... no man cared to use</i>
<i>the words "win" or "lose."</i>

886
01:39:16,855 --> 01:39:19,235
<i>After Shiloh...</i>

887
01:39:20,065 --> 01:39:22,945
<i>... the South never smiled.</i>

888
01:39:36,955 --> 01:39:38,915
- You tasted that water yet?
- No.

889
01:39:39,085 --> 01:39:40,965
Well, try it.

890
01:39:45,925 --> 01:39:47,925
- Tastes funny, huh?
- Yeah.

891
01:39:48,095 --> 01:39:50,805
I seen it before sundown. It was pink.

892
01:39:50,975 --> 01:39:53,475
Pinker than sassafras tea.

893
01:39:53,645 --> 01:39:54,765
You mean...?

894
01:39:54,935 --> 01:39:57,935
It don't seem fitting a man should have
to drink water like that.

895
01:39:58,105 --> 01:40:01,695
Don't seem fitting a man should have
to do any of the things we've done today.

896
01:40:01,855 --> 01:40:04,655
Did you kill anybody?

897
01:40:04,815 --> 01:40:06,985
I don't think so.

898
01:40:07,365 --> 01:40:10,035
I got knocked dizzy right off.

899
01:40:10,865 --> 01:40:15,165
And when I come to, found my rifle,
it was busted.

900
01:40:16,415 --> 01:40:21,125
And then some more soldiers come along
and tried to stick me in the arm.

901
01:40:22,875 --> 01:40:25,675
All the rest is mixed up after that.

902
01:40:25,835 --> 01:40:30,015
Well, I ain't killed nobody, neither.
And I don't want to.

903
01:40:31,095 --> 01:40:34,475
- Hey, where you from?
- Ohio.

904
01:40:34,645 --> 01:40:38,435
This fool war started in the East.
What's us Westerners doing in it?

905
01:40:38,605 --> 01:40:41,815
I don't rightly know anymore.

906
01:40:46,065 --> 01:40:48,615
It ain't quite what I expected.

907
01:40:50,405 --> 01:40:55,415
There ain't much glory looking at a man
with his guts hanging out.

908
01:40:58,035 --> 01:41:00,875
- Where are you from?
- Texas.

909
01:41:02,375 --> 01:41:03,965
Say...

910
01:41:04,295 --> 01:41:06,255
You ain't a Reb, are you?

911
01:41:06,425 --> 01:41:11,135
Well, I was this morning.
Tonight, I ain't so sure.

912
01:41:11,595 --> 01:41:15,435
Seems like I ought to be shooting you.

913
01:41:16,265 --> 01:41:19,515
Well, you got anything to shoot with?

914
01:41:21,275 --> 01:41:22,895
No.

915
01:41:23,065 --> 01:41:25,565
All I got's this bayonet.

916
01:41:26,065 --> 01:41:28,235
I got a pistol.

917
01:41:29,115 --> 01:41:32,155
I took it off a dead officer.

918
01:41:34,955 --> 01:41:37,915
Hey, why don't we
skedaddle out of here?

919
01:41:38,625 --> 01:41:40,705
- You mean desert?
- I mean, why don't...?

920
01:41:40,875 --> 01:41:44,455
Just leave this here war
to the folks who'd want it.

921
01:41:49,595 --> 01:41:53,595
They say there ain't no war
out in California.

922
01:41:54,805 --> 01:41:57,515
Get that battery over here.

923
01:41:59,895 --> 01:42:04,895
Stragglers, join your regiment.
Stragglers. Hey, you!

924
01:42:13,445 --> 01:42:16,785
I'm planning to move Rousseau's brigade
into this area.

925
01:42:17,455 --> 01:42:22,125
Hidden battery, placed well before dawn.
Do you approve?

926
01:42:22,285 --> 01:42:25,295
I'll approve any dispositions
you wanna make.

927
01:42:25,455 --> 01:42:29,635
If you hadn't held the flank today,
we'd have been whipped for fair.

928
01:42:30,175 --> 01:42:34,555
Sherman, let's sit down a minute.
There's something I wanna say to you.

929
01:42:36,265 --> 01:42:38,185
Lantern.

930
01:42:43,815 --> 01:42:45,975
You may find yourself in command here.

931
01:42:46,145 --> 01:42:47,235
Why?

932
01:42:47,855 --> 01:42:53,775
I've seen some of the dispatches the
newspaper correspondents have filed today.

933
01:42:53,945 --> 01:42:57,075
They're saying
I was taken by surprise this morning.

934
01:42:57,245 --> 01:42:59,915
You weren't taken by surprise.

935
01:43:00,075 --> 01:43:01,325
I was.

936
01:43:01,495 --> 01:43:03,245
No matter.

937
01:43:03,625 --> 01:43:04,745
They're saying...

938
01:43:06,545 --> 01:43:09,215
...I was drunk again last night.

939
01:43:11,925 --> 01:43:13,595
Were you?

940
01:43:16,005 --> 01:43:17,515
No.

941
01:43:18,175 --> 01:43:21,135
But you can't fight front and rear.

942
01:43:21,305 --> 01:43:23,555
Win or lose, tomorrow...

943
01:43:24,515 --> 01:43:26,185
...I intend to resign.

944
01:43:27,895 --> 01:43:30,565
Because of the newspapers?

945
01:43:32,565 --> 01:43:35,695
Because of a general
lack of confidence in me.

946
01:43:35,865 --> 01:43:38,995
Oh, don't you think
I've ever felt like that?

947
01:43:39,155 --> 01:43:42,745
A month ago they were saying
I was crazy. Insane.

948
01:43:42,915 --> 01:43:47,375
Now they're calling me a hero.
A hero or crazy, I'm the same man.

949
01:43:47,545 --> 01:43:49,915
It doesn't matter what the people think.

950
01:43:50,085 --> 01:43:51,675
It's what you think, Grant.

951
01:43:54,795 --> 01:43:56,805
You mean that's Grant?

952
01:43:58,765 --> 01:44:00,225
I reckon.

953
01:44:00,385 --> 01:44:02,555
General Grant.

954
01:44:02,725 --> 01:44:06,265
You know this war's gonna be won
in the West, and how to win it.

955
01:44:06,435 --> 01:44:08,975
Everything you've done proves it.

956
01:44:09,645 --> 01:44:14,865
And I say that a man has the right
to resign only if he's wrong.

957
01:44:15,155 --> 01:44:17,155
Not if he's right.

958
01:44:18,735 --> 01:44:23,365
I guess I never thought of it that way.

959
01:44:24,285 --> 01:44:25,495
I'll think it over.

960
01:44:26,415 --> 01:44:27,915
What is there to think about?

961
01:44:28,085 --> 01:44:32,295
The Army's better off with you
than without you. That's the test.

962
01:44:35,965 --> 01:44:37,675
All right.

963
01:44:38,095 --> 01:44:39,255
Thanks.

964
01:44:41,135 --> 01:44:44,055
There's a lot to do
before morning, Sherman.

965
01:44:44,225 --> 01:44:45,265
What are you doing?

966
01:45:03,905 --> 01:45:06,245
Why did you make me do that?

967
01:45:54,375 --> 01:45:56,085
Fire.

968
01:47:36,315 --> 01:47:38,275
Hey, Zeb!

969
01:48:03,465 --> 01:48:05,635
Didn't you get my letter?

970
01:48:06,805 --> 01:48:09,465
I wrote more than four months ago.

971
01:48:12,095 --> 01:48:13,845
She never was...

972
01:48:14,015 --> 01:48:18,145
...quite the same
after she got the news about Pa.

973
01:48:21,275 --> 01:48:24,485
I don't think she minded going,
Zeb, except...

974
01:48:26,115 --> 01:48:28,405
...she wanted to see you again.

975
01:48:33,245 --> 01:48:36,245
Of course Pa ain't really there.

976
01:48:38,625 --> 01:48:40,955
I put up a stone anyway.

977
01:49:00,105 --> 01:49:01,685
Well...

978
01:49:02,355 --> 01:49:04,485
...better be on my way.

979
01:49:05,025 --> 01:49:07,525
Way? Where?

980
01:49:07,695 --> 01:49:09,615
I need you, Zeb.

981
01:49:09,775 --> 01:49:12,245
Only one thing brought me back.

982
01:49:13,365 --> 01:49:15,325
She's...

983
01:49:15,495 --> 01:49:17,785
Well, this farm is half yours.

984
01:49:17,955 --> 01:49:22,545
I was thinking we'd finally clear away that
patch of woods down by the river and...

985
01:49:22,705 --> 01:49:26,375
You're twice the farmer I am.
You don't need me.

986
01:49:26,545 --> 01:49:30,175
Farm's all yours. It's only fair.

987
01:49:31,555 --> 01:49:34,345
Sure don't feel right about this.

988
01:49:34,515 --> 01:49:36,015
What are you gonna do?

989
01:49:36,185 --> 01:49:37,845
I haven't mustered out yet.

990
01:49:38,015 --> 01:49:40,145
I can still transfer to the regulars.

991
01:49:40,315 --> 01:49:43,395
Cavalry, maybe. Go west.

992
01:49:43,565 --> 01:49:46,065
Have to fight Indians?

993
01:49:46,905 --> 01:49:49,275
You sure are hard to make out, Zeb.

994
01:49:49,445 --> 01:49:53,445
Now, what do you wanna do that for?
Do you like fighting?

995
01:49:54,745 --> 01:49:58,915
You remember the story Pa used to tell us
about fighting that grizzly bear?

996
01:49:59,075 --> 01:50:00,165
Yeah.

997
01:50:00,335 --> 01:50:03,585
And I asked him, I said,
"Well, why'd you get in such a fix?

998
01:50:03,755 --> 01:50:06,165
Do you like fighting grizzlies?"

999
01:50:06,335 --> 01:50:07,875
He said:

1000
01:50:08,045 --> 01:50:12,385
"Well, uh, not especially. Uh...

1001
01:50:12,595 --> 01:50:17,095
I just wanted to go somewhere
and the bear was there first."

1002
01:50:29,655 --> 01:50:31,275
Well, I...

1003
01:50:34,235 --> 01:50:37,035
I guess I just wanna go somewhere too.

1004
01:50:41,285 --> 01:50:44,745
- So long.
- So long, Zeb.

1005
01:51:03,935 --> 01:51:07,235
<i>Even while North and South</i>
<i>were being torn apart...</i>

1006
01:51:07,395 --> 01:51:11,275
<i>... East and West had been</i>
<i>drawn together by the Pony Express...</i>

1007
01:51:11,445 --> 01:51:13,865
<i>... the most daring mail route in history.</i>

1008
01:51:14,025 --> 01:51:17,695
<i>Eighty riders were in the saddle</i>
<i>at all times, night and day, in all weather.</i>

1009
01:51:17,865 --> 01:51:20,665
<i>Half of them riding east,</i>
<i>half riding west...</i>

1010
01:51:20,825 --> 01:51:22,955
<i>... between Missouri and Sacramento...</i>

1011
01:51:23,125 --> 01:51:27,165
<i>... carrying mail across country</i>
<i>in days instead of months.</i>

1012
01:51:27,335 --> 01:51:30,125
<i>Unarmed, they rode to save weight.</i>

1013
01:51:30,295 --> 01:51:33,965
<i>Five dollars a letter, the mail cost,</i>
<i>and on thin paper too.</i>

1014
01:51:34,135 --> 01:51:37,095
<i>It was courage, skill and speed...</i>

1015
01:51:37,265 --> 01:51:42,765
<i>... against hostile Indians, bandits,</i>
<i>hell and occasional high water.</i>

1016
01:51:43,305 --> 01:51:45,725
<i>Even as they rode,</i>
<i>men were already building...</i>

1017
01:51:45,895 --> 01:51:50,695
<i>... a faster message carrier across</i>
<i>the country: The Overland Telegraph.</i>

1018
01:51:50,855 --> 01:51:53,355
<i>And the Indians found</i>
<i>a new amusement...</i>

1019
01:51:53,525 --> 01:51:56,695
<i>... listening to the level tune</i>
<i>of the singing wires.</i>

1020
01:51:56,865 --> 01:51:58,995
<i>But far less amusing to the Indians...</i>

1021
01:51:59,155 --> 01:52:03,035
<i>... was the coming of the steel roadway</i>
<i>of the iron horse.</i>

1022
01:52:03,205 --> 01:52:09,205
<i>The surveyors, route lay through immense</i>
<i>natural barriers, the Rocky Mountains...</i>

1023
01:52:09,375 --> 01:52:12,625
<i>... and the equally discouraging</i>
<i>High Sierras.</i>

1024
01:52:12,795 --> 01:52:16,715
<i>But range upon range could never stop</i>
<i>the titanic contest...</i>

1025
01:52:16,885 --> 01:52:19,385
<i>... between two corporate giants</i>
<i>racing to put down...</i>

1026
01:52:19,555 --> 01:52:22,885
<i>... the greatest mileage of track</i>
<i>before they met.</i>

1027
01:52:23,055 --> 01:52:27,855
<i>The Central Pacific eastward</i>
<i>from Sacramento through the Sierras.</i>

1028
01:52:31,685 --> 01:52:35,775
<i>And the Union Pacific,</i>
<i>forging westward across the plains...</i>

1029
01:52:35,945 --> 01:52:37,825
<i>... with the Rockies still to come.</i>

1030
01:52:37,985 --> 01:52:43,535
<i>The prize in the race was free land,</i>
<i>vast parcels for every mile of track laid.</i>

1031
01:52:43,705 --> 01:52:47,125
<i>Land that would one day</i>
<i>be worth millions.</i>

1032
01:52:52,295 --> 01:52:54,085
Hold it.

1033
01:52:54,255 --> 01:52:56,045
Set it down.

1034
01:52:56,585 --> 01:52:58,755
Workers, up.

1035
01:53:04,765 --> 01:53:06,395
Where'd you find them?

1036
01:53:06,555 --> 01:53:08,975
About a mile back yonder.

1037
01:53:09,435 --> 01:53:12,895
That's Johnny Hormatz.
That's Jack Perkin.

1038
01:53:15,065 --> 01:53:16,945
What the hell is this? A picnic?

1039
01:53:17,115 --> 01:53:20,825
- Well, the Indians got a couple of our men...
- Mister, you were the foreman here.

1040
01:53:20,985 --> 01:53:24,035
Now you're a tracklayer.
Now get back to work, all of you!

1041
01:53:24,205 --> 01:53:25,575
Move it!

1042
01:53:25,745 --> 01:53:27,375
Fast!

1043
01:53:27,535 --> 01:53:28,665
- You.
- Yes, sir.

1044
01:53:28,835 --> 01:53:31,165
You're the foreman
till I can find somebody better.

1045
01:53:31,335 --> 01:53:32,665
- Yes, sir.
- Get them at it.

1046
01:53:32,835 --> 01:53:34,795
- Wait a minute.
- Move it!

1047
01:53:34,965 --> 01:53:37,715
Your name Jethro Stuart?

1048
01:53:38,005 --> 01:53:39,295
All right, get at it.

1049
01:53:39,465 --> 01:53:43,095
Well, Mr. Jethro Stuart, you're hired
to hunt buffalo to feed these men...

1050
01:53:43,265 --> 01:53:46,805
...not to stop their work.
Why'd you bring these bodies here?

1051
01:53:46,975 --> 01:53:50,105
They're railroaders. I thought somebody
in the railroad might be interested.

1052
01:53:50,265 --> 01:53:53,145
I'm the railroad and I'm not interested.

1053
01:53:53,315 --> 01:53:56,565
You should've buried them,
then tracked down the Indians who did it.

1054
01:53:57,525 --> 01:54:00,025
Well, Mr. King, like you said,
I was hired to hunt...

1055
01:54:00,195 --> 01:54:03,325
...not to dig graves or fight Indians.

1056
01:54:03,485 --> 01:54:05,195
Those fellas are mostly old soldiers.

1057
01:54:05,365 --> 01:54:07,865
You wouldn't think a couple
dead men bother them much.

1058
01:54:08,035 --> 01:54:11,915
I don't want anything in their thick skulls
but their work. Do you understand?

1059
01:54:12,085 --> 01:54:15,125
Now, get rid of those bodies.
Start tracking those Indians.

1060
01:54:15,295 --> 01:54:20,005
You keep forgetting, Mr. King,
my job's buffalo.

1061
01:54:21,965 --> 01:54:23,805
It was buffalo.

1062
01:54:23,965 --> 01:54:26,345
Go to the paymaster and draw your time.

1063
01:54:26,515 --> 01:54:28,935
Well, now, that foreman fella,
you didn't fire him.

1064
01:54:29,095 --> 01:54:31,895
You just took him down a peg
because you needed him.

1065
01:54:32,065 --> 01:54:34,025
Who's gonna shoot buffalo? You?

1066
01:55:06,555 --> 01:55:09,225
- What the devil is that?
- Milk.

1067
01:55:09,385 --> 01:55:11,225
Milk?

1068
01:55:11,555 --> 01:55:14,105
The Army must've changed
since I was in it.

1069
01:55:14,265 --> 01:55:18,065
- Just rode in. I'm hungry.
- You are, huh?

1070
01:55:18,895 --> 01:55:21,405
But you'd rather watch them than eat.

1071
01:55:21,565 --> 01:55:23,235
- Is that it?
- That's it.

1072
01:55:23,405 --> 01:55:26,825
Well, I wish you were as eager
to protect this railroad.

1073
01:55:26,995 --> 01:55:30,075
Did you get any word about those two men
who were killed today?

1074
01:55:30,245 --> 01:55:33,285
I tracked the Arapahos
and talked to the chief.

1075
01:55:33,455 --> 01:55:35,545
Those men were a mile off
the right-of-way...

1076
01:55:35,705 --> 01:55:38,795
...where they had no business,
drunk and chasing squaws.

1077
01:55:38,965 --> 01:55:42,675
- As much their fault as it was the Indians'.
- That a fact?

1078
01:55:42,835 --> 01:55:47,175
Well, soldier boy, your job
is to fight Indians, not to agree with them.

1079
01:55:47,345 --> 01:55:51,805
Mr. King, there were 200 Arapahos
and I had 20 men.

1080
01:55:51,975 --> 01:55:53,725
Now, to me...

1081
01:55:53,895 --> 01:55:55,935
...agreeing seemed wiser than fighting.

1082
01:55:56,105 --> 01:55:58,065
To you, huh?

1083
01:55:58,225 --> 01:56:01,855
Well, you know, I might just send off
a wire to the colonel.

1084
01:56:02,105 --> 01:56:04,275
He may not agree.

1085
01:56:05,315 --> 01:56:08,075
I already reported. He does agree.

1086
01:56:41,275 --> 01:56:44,065
Acknowledged and understood. Sergeant.

1087
01:56:44,235 --> 01:56:45,655
Trouble, sir?

1088
01:56:51,155 --> 01:56:52,655
I don't know.

1089
01:56:52,825 --> 01:56:54,665
Hey, lieutenant.

1090
01:56:56,745 --> 01:56:58,835
I got a message:
Indians are up to something.

1091
01:56:58,995 --> 01:57:00,755
You know anything about it?

1092
01:57:01,085 --> 01:57:03,665
Chief says railroad busted the agreement.

1093
01:57:03,835 --> 01:57:07,175
Changed the route, come smack
through Arapaho hunting grounds.

1094
01:57:07,345 --> 01:57:09,755
- You sure the chief's right?
- Plenty sure.

1095
01:57:09,925 --> 01:57:12,175
They're getting the war paint ready.

1096
01:57:15,895 --> 01:57:17,765
Can you stand there and tell me...

1097
01:57:18,105 --> 01:57:21,815
...that one little change is gonna cost
the Arapahos one buffalo.

1098
01:57:21,975 --> 01:57:24,315
- Or even one jackrabbit?
- Mr. King.

1099
01:57:24,485 --> 01:57:27,815
They can be made to see it differently.
Who's hurting them?

1100
01:57:27,985 --> 01:57:31,035
What's a railroad anyway?
Two tracks and a whistle.

1101
01:57:31,865 --> 01:57:35,325
It's not the tracks they're afraid of.
It's what the tracks bring.

1102
01:57:35,495 --> 01:57:38,325
The buffalo hunters slaughtering off
their herds.

1103
01:57:38,495 --> 01:57:40,165
And then the settlers coming in.

1104
01:57:40,335 --> 01:57:43,205
And when will that be?
Twenty, 30 years, maybe?

1105
01:57:43,375 --> 01:57:45,545
By then, we'll all be dead.

1106
01:57:45,715 --> 01:57:47,885
Right now we're just crossing the land.

1107
01:57:48,045 --> 01:57:51,715
That's all. Land that's safe
to the Arapahos for our lifetime.

1108
01:57:51,885 --> 01:57:53,055
Now, you go talk to them.

1109
01:57:53,215 --> 01:57:56,185
Smoke a peace pipe with them.
Do anything they want.

1110
01:57:56,345 --> 01:57:58,555
Just get them to make a new agreement.

1111
01:58:00,435 --> 01:58:03,645
That's your job, isn't it?
Keeping the peace?

1112
01:58:05,355 --> 01:58:07,485
I'll keep the peace, Mr. King...

1113
01:58:07,655 --> 01:58:10,025
...but you keep your promise.

1114
01:58:18,535 --> 01:58:20,585
Hear your name's Rawlings,
you're from Ohio.

1115
01:58:20,745 --> 01:58:24,085
Your pa's name couldn't be
Linus Rawlings, could it?

1116
01:58:24,255 --> 01:58:25,915
- Could be.
- Knew him.

1117
01:58:26,085 --> 01:58:27,465
Jethro Stuart.

1118
01:58:27,625 --> 01:58:30,255
- He used to speak of you.
- Used to?

1119
01:58:30,425 --> 01:58:32,635
Pa was killed at Shiloh.

1120
01:58:33,305 --> 01:58:35,595
Sit down, Mr. Stuart.

1121
01:58:36,595 --> 01:58:38,345
Well, better than dying behind a plow.

1122
01:58:39,145 --> 01:58:42,435
I tried it. Settled down for a year once.

1123
01:58:42,605 --> 01:58:44,775
Took 10 years off my life.

1124
01:58:47,235 --> 01:58:48,945
Your ma...

1125
01:58:49,405 --> 01:58:54,195
She must've been something real special
getting old Linus to stay put.

1126
01:58:54,365 --> 01:58:57,955
She was, Mr. Stuart. Very special.

1127
01:58:58,115 --> 01:58:59,785
Old Linus.

1128
01:58:59,955 --> 01:59:02,495
Two years running once.
Your pa and me trapped together.

1129
01:59:02,665 --> 01:59:04,585
Up along the Waunakee.

1130
01:59:04,745 --> 01:59:07,295
Got so many beaver,
we had to tie them tail-to-tail...

1131
01:59:07,465 --> 01:59:09,375
...just to drag them down the mountain.

1132
01:59:09,545 --> 01:59:12,635
Over a mile long it was,
that line of beaver pelts.

1133
01:59:12,795 --> 01:59:17,135
Mr. Stuart, my father could take the truth
and stretch it about six ways.

1134
01:59:17,305 --> 01:59:19,385
You sound just like him.

1135
01:59:20,345 --> 01:59:22,895
I'll take it you meant that kindly.

1136
01:59:23,055 --> 01:59:26,105
Well, I'd think twice
before I called you a liar.

1137
01:59:26,275 --> 01:59:29,025
Tell me something,
talking about liars.

1138
01:59:29,195 --> 01:59:33,945
Why would a son of old Linus
get mixed up with a man like Mike King?

1139
01:59:34,825 --> 01:59:36,325
I know what you mean.

1140
01:59:36,485 --> 01:59:39,495
- But Mike King isn't the railroad.
- Oh?

1141
01:59:39,655 --> 01:59:41,825
I don't think he knows that.

1142
01:59:41,995 --> 01:59:44,455
He's changing the route back, is he?

1143
01:59:44,625 --> 01:59:46,085
No.

1144
01:59:46,995 --> 01:59:48,005
I know.

1145
01:59:48,165 --> 01:59:51,175
But he'd do anything
to gain a day on the Central Pacific.

1146
01:59:51,335 --> 01:59:55,965
He's not a fool. He doesn't want a war,
and neither do the Arapahos.

1147
01:59:56,675 --> 01:59:59,515
I think I could get them to agree
to this change in route...

1148
01:59:59,675 --> 02:00:01,845
...if I sit down and talk with them
for a while.

1149
02:00:02,015 --> 02:00:04,685
- How you gonna get them to do it?
- That's just it.

1150
02:00:04,855 --> 02:00:08,145
I need somebody that knows
the language and who they trust.

1151
02:00:09,355 --> 02:00:12,735
You wouldn't happen to know someone
like that, would you, Mr. Stuart?

1152
02:00:15,775 --> 02:00:20,245
Your pa could set a trap
like no man I ever come across.

1153
02:00:20,405 --> 02:00:23,415
Just coax them on and, bam.

1154
02:00:40,555 --> 02:00:44,055
You'd better do something
so he'll know you're pledging your word.

1155
02:01:30,015 --> 02:01:34,445
That blame whistle's like the crack of doom
for all that's natural.

1156
02:01:34,605 --> 02:01:37,865
My ma felt a man ought to
make his scratch on the land.

1157
02:01:38,025 --> 02:01:40,985
Leave it a little different
than when he come.

1158
02:01:41,155 --> 02:01:43,825
Anyway, thanks for fixing things
with the chief.

1159
02:01:43,995 --> 02:01:45,455
Me? I fixed nothing.

1160
02:01:45,615 --> 02:01:48,625
You put the words to my mouth
but that won't make them come true.

1161
02:01:48,785 --> 02:01:51,245
Jethro, I said what I had to
to keep the peace.

1162
02:01:51,415 --> 02:01:53,375
- I know there's a risk.
- Risk?

1163
02:01:53,545 --> 02:01:55,545
Maybe you don't understand.

1164
02:01:55,715 --> 02:01:57,295
You pledged your word back there.

1165
02:01:57,465 --> 02:01:59,965
Not mine, not the Army's,
not the railroad's.

1166
02:02:00,135 --> 02:02:02,845
It's your word told them
they'd keep their hunting grounds.

1167
02:02:03,015 --> 02:02:05,725
- I think they will.
- I think you got your neck stuck out...

1168
02:02:05,885 --> 02:02:09,515
...like a prairie chicken waiting for one side
or the other to chop it off.

1169
02:02:09,685 --> 02:02:12,605
Your pa and me got kicked out
of one territory after another...

1170
02:02:12,775 --> 02:02:16,195
...with people pouring in,
killing off game, putting up towns.

1171
02:02:16,355 --> 02:02:18,155
It ain't gonna stop.

1172
02:02:18,315 --> 02:02:22,275
Your treaty's gonna get broke and
I don't wanna be around to see it happen.

1173
02:02:22,825 --> 02:02:25,115
Look me up when you get your bellyful.

1174
02:02:25,285 --> 02:02:27,535
- Where you going?
- Heading back to the mountains.

1175
02:02:27,705 --> 02:02:31,625
A high lonesome
where there ain't no people at all yet.

1176
02:02:31,875 --> 02:02:33,625
So long.

1177
02:02:40,675 --> 02:02:44,805
<i>By now, the Central Pacific had broken</i>
<i>through the wall of the high Sierras...</i>

1178
02:02:44,965 --> 02:02:49,435
<i>... and was straining eastward</i>
<i>across the flatlands of Nevada.</i>

1179
02:02:49,595 --> 02:02:53,395
<i>While the Union Pacific,</i>
<i>thanks to its long peace with the Indians...</i>

1180
02:02:53,565 --> 02:02:58,275
<i>... was able to keep up pressure</i>
<i>just as avidly in the opposite direction.</i>

1181
02:03:12,955 --> 02:03:16,455
<i>The competition was exciting,</i>
<i>but also costly...</i>

1182
02:03:16,625 --> 02:03:21,835
<i>... and both companies were itching</i>
<i>to earn money from tracks already laid.</i>

1183
02:03:35,515 --> 02:03:38,275
Did the horses ride all right, Jake?
- No better than I did.

1184
02:03:38,435 --> 02:03:42,405
We'll have to rest them a day before we can
start hunting rabbits, much less buffalo.

1185
02:03:42,565 --> 02:03:44,695
Just get them to water right away.

1186
02:03:44,865 --> 02:03:47,075
You say no buffalo hunter come.

1187
02:03:47,235 --> 02:03:48,865
White man, liar.

1188
02:03:49,035 --> 02:03:51,705
We scout for you no more.

1189
02:03:57,545 --> 02:03:59,125
Not in our lifetime, you said.

1190
02:03:59,295 --> 02:04:03,425
And there they are.
The buffalo slaughterers and the settlers.

1191
02:04:03,585 --> 02:04:06,215
All right, it's sooner than I figured.

1192
02:04:06,385 --> 02:04:09,595
But the railroad's broke.
They need money to keep moving on.

1193
02:04:09,765 --> 02:04:12,055
No people, no money.
No money, no railroad.

1194
02:04:12,225 --> 02:04:14,855
- It's as simple as that.
- What about the Arapahos?

1195
02:04:15,015 --> 02:04:18,895
Just take a look at those people.
Half of them straight from Europe.

1196
02:04:19,065 --> 02:04:21,195
They'll have a rough time,
but they'll make it.

1197
02:04:21,355 --> 02:04:23,275
And do you wanna know
why they'll make it?

1198
02:04:23,445 --> 02:04:26,905
Because they're willing
to change their ways.

1199
02:04:27,075 --> 02:04:30,115
Arapahos will have to change too.
If they don't, they're finished.

1200
02:04:30,285 --> 02:04:33,165
I know they have to
and someday the land will be taken over...

1201
02:04:33,325 --> 02:04:35,875
...by these farmers
with their towns and their cattle.

1202
02:04:36,035 --> 02:04:37,245
But not like this.

1203
02:04:37,415 --> 02:04:40,835
They don't have to be double-crossed,
and I don't have to be a part of it.

1204
02:04:41,005 --> 02:04:43,255
You don't, lieutenant?

1205
02:04:43,425 --> 02:04:45,635
Well, aren't you forgetting that uniform?

1206
02:04:45,795 --> 02:04:48,005
That's right, Mr. King, I'm forgetting it.

1207
02:04:48,175 --> 02:04:51,475
If the Army hasn't got any authority
out here, I'm resigning. And now.

1208
02:04:51,635 --> 02:04:53,805
I don't see how that's
gonna help the Arapahos.

1209
02:04:53,975 --> 02:04:55,305
Nothing will help them.

1210
02:04:55,475 --> 02:04:58,185
But nothing's gonna stop them.

1211
02:05:28,385 --> 02:05:30,135
Indian attack!

1212
02:05:30,305 --> 02:05:32,055
Indian attack! Take cover!

1213
02:05:42,855 --> 02:05:44,235
Take a good look.

1214
02:05:44,395 --> 02:05:48,115
You wanted a war and you got one.
I hope you're the first man killed in it.

1215
02:05:48,275 --> 02:05:50,735
Turn those wagons over!

1216
02:06:12,425 --> 02:06:14,555
Shoot for the lead horses.
Pick off the chief.

1217
02:06:14,725 --> 02:06:16,935
Rawlings, try that.

1218
02:06:26,275 --> 02:06:28,405
The Indians are stampeding the buffalo.

1219
02:06:28,565 --> 02:06:31,075
Dirty skunks. Come on.

1220
02:08:47,705 --> 02:08:51,045
I told you there'd be no war.

1221
02:08:51,215 --> 02:08:52,665
Look at them.

1222
02:08:52,835 --> 02:08:54,925
They've quit.

1223
02:08:55,085 --> 02:08:57,215
They'll be back.

1224
02:08:57,595 --> 02:09:02,175
They just sent a bunch of animals
to kill an animal they call the "iron horse."

1225
02:09:02,345 --> 02:09:04,725
Well, it's still standing, isn't it?

1226
02:09:04,895 --> 02:09:06,975
And nothing's gonna stop it.

1227
02:09:26,995 --> 02:09:29,745
You think you can live with that?

1228
02:09:30,375 --> 02:09:32,835
I can live with it, or I can die with it.

1229
02:09:33,005 --> 02:09:34,835
Just listen.

1230
02:09:35,005 --> 02:09:37,425
You can live with that?

1231
02:09:38,095 --> 02:09:39,255
That?

1232
02:09:39,425 --> 02:09:41,175
That ain't crying.

1233
02:09:41,345 --> 02:09:44,265
That's just new life going on.

1234
02:09:49,515 --> 02:09:53,435
Pick up this woman and put the rest
of the injured in the tent house.

1235
02:09:57,945 --> 02:09:58,945
Hey, Merv...

1236
02:09:59,115 --> 02:10:02,195
The rest of you, back to work.
We got a railroad to build.

1237
02:10:55,415 --> 02:10:57,165
Well...

1238
02:10:57,665 --> 02:11:00,005
Looks like you finally got your bellyful.

1239
02:11:00,175 --> 02:11:02,095
Hello, Jethro.

1240
02:11:02,635 --> 02:11:04,805
Appears you're doing well.

1241
02:11:05,515 --> 02:11:07,345
Can't complain.

1242
02:11:07,515 --> 02:11:11,725
Creek's loaded with beavers,
fighting their way into the trap.

1243
02:11:11,895 --> 02:11:13,765
No white men looking
over my shoulder...

1244
02:11:13,935 --> 02:11:16,525
...and the Indians are plumb cordial.

1245
02:11:16,685 --> 02:11:19,525
Toss your stuff in there.
Plenty of room for two.

1246
02:11:19,695 --> 02:11:21,195
Thanks.

1247
02:11:22,445 --> 02:11:23,615
You'll be bunking yonder.

1248
02:11:23,775 --> 02:11:26,535
Take your bearings now
so you can find it when you need it.

1249
02:11:26,695 --> 02:11:29,575
If you don't like my snoring,
you can build your own cabin.

1250
02:11:29,745 --> 02:11:31,915
I'll furnish the ax.

1251
02:11:33,455 --> 02:11:36,835
- Thanks. I'm just passing through.
- Through to where?

1252
02:11:37,005 --> 02:11:39,125
Anywhere you go is like
where you've been.

1253
02:11:39,295 --> 02:11:41,545
Ain't you lost enough tail feathers
back there?

1254
02:11:43,595 --> 02:11:45,675
I've been plucked some.

1255
02:11:46,595 --> 02:11:48,555
But that's what I like about this country.

1256
02:11:48,725 --> 02:11:51,685
There's always greener grass
over the next hill.

1257
02:11:51,845 --> 02:11:54,685
Not no more.
Not since that damn railroad come.

1258
02:11:54,855 --> 02:11:58,395
All the grass is being staked out now,
with a lock on it.

1259
02:12:00,565 --> 02:12:04,155
Maybe I'll just have to climb
a little higher hill to find it.

1260
02:12:07,075 --> 02:12:08,575
How about coming along?

1261
02:12:08,745 --> 02:12:10,825
You crazy?

1262
02:12:10,995 --> 02:12:14,745
Like the Indians say, "These rocks
and trees around here feel no call to move."

1263
02:12:14,915 --> 02:12:16,495
Why should I?

1264
02:12:17,585 --> 02:12:19,915
Guess I'm not an Indian, Jethro.

1265
02:12:20,085 --> 02:12:22,925
But I'm sure not a rock nor a tree.

1266
02:12:23,085 --> 02:12:26,255
Man belongs his own kind,
like him or not.

1267
02:13:02,375 --> 02:13:06,635
<i>The coming of railroads brought changes</i>
<i>in the land through which they passed.</i>

1268
02:13:06,795 --> 02:13:10,465
<i>Now immense herds of cattle were driven</i>
<i>hundreds of miles to meet the lines...</i>

1269
02:13:10,635 --> 02:13:12,475
<i>... bound for markets in the East.</i>

1270
02:13:13,015 --> 02:13:16,185
<i>Fences went up, cattle trails were barred...</i>

1271
02:13:16,475 --> 02:13:20,225
<i>... and a long and bloody wrangle began</i>
<i>between cattlemen and homesteaders.</i>

1272
02:13:20,815 --> 02:13:24,905
<i>The law was in the hands of whoever</i>
<i>could shoot fast and straight...</i>

1273
02:13:25,065 --> 02:13:29,275
<i>... except where there was somebody</i>
<i>determined to stand for law.</i>

1274
02:13:29,445 --> 02:13:33,205
<i>Others might look on sheep and a shepherd</i>
<i>as a pastoral scene.</i>

1275
02:13:35,915 --> 02:13:37,375
<i>Not the cattleman.</i>

1276
02:13:37,535 --> 02:13:43,125
<i>To him, sheep destroyed grass,</i>
<i>and grass came dear.</i>

1277
02:13:43,295 --> 02:13:45,925
<i>And if a man's life were held cheaper</i>
<i>than grass...</i>

1278
02:13:46,085 --> 02:13:50,095
<i>... it was considered a casualty of war,</i>
<i>not a crime.</i>

1279
02:13:50,255 --> 02:13:55,975
<i>And, in all this, the man with the star</i>
<i>was only one against many.</i>

1280
02:13:56,385 --> 02:13:59,185
<i>But time was running out</i>
<i>for the reckless ones...</i>

1281
02:13:59,355 --> 02:14:03,025
<i>... the desperadoes,</i>
<i>the gallop-and-gunshot boys...</i>

1282
02:14:03,185 --> 02:14:05,985
<i>... as more and more citizens demanded</i>
<i>respect for the law...</i>

1283
02:14:06,145 --> 02:14:09,025
<i>... and showed themselves ready to fight</i>
<i>to uphold it.</i>

1284
02:14:09,195 --> 02:14:12,535
<i>And the raw new towns that sprung up</i>
<i>in the West began to dream...</i>

1285
02:14:12,695 --> 02:14:17,455
<i>... of becoming as refined as that one-time</i>
<i>hooligan city by the Golden Gate.</i>

1286
02:14:17,615 --> 02:14:19,915
<i>San Francisco was now respectable.</i>

1287
02:14:20,085 --> 02:14:24,045
<i>So sophisticated, in fact,</i>
<i>it even had mansions up for auction.</i>

1288
02:14:24,205 --> 02:14:25,875
Two thousand dollars.

1289
02:14:26,045 --> 02:14:28,045
Two thousand dollars.

1290
02:14:28,215 --> 02:14:30,295
Is that your last bid?

1291
02:14:30,465 --> 02:14:35,055
Ladies and gentlemen,
this trophy is solid gold and fully inscribed.

1292
02:14:35,225 --> 02:14:40,185
"Mr. Cleve Van Valen, president.
San Francisco-Kansas City Railroad."

1293
02:14:40,355 --> 02:14:43,105
It's a treasure he held dear to his heart.

1294
02:14:43,275 --> 02:14:47,195
Do I hear $3000
for this priceless possession?

1295
02:14:47,355 --> 02:14:49,735
Priceless, my foot.

1296
02:14:49,905 --> 02:14:52,235
We used it for a doorstop.

1297
02:14:52,735 --> 02:14:55,245
- Twenty-five hundred.
- Twenty-five hundred dollars.

1298
02:14:55,405 --> 02:14:57,245
Twenty-five hundred dollars.

1299
02:14:57,405 --> 02:15:00,075
Twenty-five hundred? Sold $2500.

1300
02:15:00,785 --> 02:15:02,915
It's a sad day, Lilith.

1301
02:15:03,085 --> 02:15:04,585
Sad?

1302
02:15:04,745 --> 02:15:07,415
We made and spent
three fortunes together.

1303
02:15:07,585 --> 02:15:09,585
What's so sad about that?

1304
02:15:09,755 --> 02:15:13,425
And if he'd lived a little longer,
we would've made and spent another.

1305
02:15:13,715 --> 02:15:15,845
- I beg your pardon, Mrs. Van Valen.
- What?

1306
02:15:16,015 --> 02:15:17,975
The chair, it's been sold. I'm sorry.

1307
02:15:18,135 --> 02:15:20,805
Well then, take it.
Quit apologizing and take it.

1308
02:15:20,975 --> 02:15:22,225
Thank you, madam.

1309
02:15:22,395 --> 02:15:24,935
If there'd been some other way
to pay off the debts...

1310
02:15:25,105 --> 02:15:26,395
It doesn't matter.

1311
02:15:26,565 --> 02:15:30,025
I've got two things
no one can ever take from me:

1312
02:15:30,695 --> 02:15:34,235
This and my land in Arizona.

1313
02:15:34,405 --> 02:15:37,365
Lilith, I don't want to dash any hopes...

1314
02:15:37,535 --> 02:15:39,745
...but that ranch is nearly worthless.

1315
02:15:39,915 --> 02:15:41,415
Well, it's there, isn't it?

1316
02:15:41,575 --> 02:15:44,455
Yes, but most of the cattle
have been sold off or stolen.

1317
02:15:44,625 --> 02:15:47,125
- I'll get cattle.
- You'll need someone to work it.

1318
02:15:47,295 --> 02:15:49,625
- Someone to manage it for you.
- I'll get that too.

1319
02:15:49,795 --> 02:15:50,925
Who?

1320
02:15:51,085 --> 02:15:55,135
My nephew.
He's a marshal out there somewhere.

1321
02:15:55,305 --> 02:15:59,055
Now, Lilith, at your age,
it might be kind of rough.

1322
02:15:59,635 --> 02:16:01,225
Rough?

1323
02:16:01,385 --> 02:16:06,185
My ma and pa were killed
going down the river just looking for land.

1324
02:16:06,775 --> 02:16:10,985
I guess I got a little of that Prescott blood
in me after all.

1325
02:16:19,865 --> 02:16:20,905
Pa?

1326
02:16:21,495 --> 02:16:25,495
Is Aunt Lilith's house on Nob Hill
as high as that?

1327
02:16:26,835 --> 02:16:28,375
I don't know, son.

1328
02:16:28,545 --> 02:16:32,375
On our way home, you ask your aunt Lilith.
She'll tell you.

1329
02:17:21,135 --> 02:17:23,725
Honey? Do you think you'll know her?

1330
02:17:23,885 --> 02:17:25,395
- What?
- You aunt Lilith.

1331
02:17:25,555 --> 02:17:28,225
- Do you think you'll recognize her?
- Sure.

1332
02:17:28,395 --> 02:17:31,735
Zeb? What's the matter?

1333
02:17:32,105 --> 02:17:33,395
Nothing.

1334
02:17:33,565 --> 02:17:35,065
Come on.

1335
02:17:40,785 --> 02:17:42,575
Thank you.

1336
02:17:47,875 --> 02:17:51,915
- Ma'am, are you our great-aunt Lilith?
- If you're Zeb's children, I am.

1337
02:17:54,875 --> 02:17:57,545
- Lilith.
- Zeb.

1338
02:17:58,595 --> 02:18:01,095
Zeb Rawlings.

1339
02:18:01,255 --> 02:18:02,765
Oh, goodness.

1340
02:18:02,925 --> 02:18:05,765
I swore up and down I wasn't gonna cry.

1341
02:18:06,095 --> 02:18:09,475
You're just as pretty as Ma said you was.

1342
02:18:09,645 --> 02:18:11,895
I'd like you to meet my wife, Julie.

1343
02:18:12,065 --> 02:18:13,485
Pleased to meet you.

1344
02:18:13,645 --> 02:18:15,895
I'm pleased to meet you too.

1345
02:18:16,065 --> 02:18:19,275
I just can't tell you how pleased.

1346
02:18:19,445 --> 02:18:22,285
This here's Eve, underneath all the jam.

1347
02:18:22,445 --> 02:18:24,615
- Come on and meet Sam now.
- Sam?

1348
02:18:24,785 --> 02:18:28,285
Sam's our horse.
He could pull two wagons if he wanted.

1349
02:18:28,455 --> 02:18:32,245
Oh, well, if you'll excuse me,
I have my orders to meet Sam.

1350
02:18:32,415 --> 02:18:33,455
Come on.

1351
02:18:33,955 --> 02:18:36,715
- Oh, just a minute now, boys.
- But he's on the other side.

1352
02:18:36,875 --> 02:18:38,335
Come on.
Okay.

1353
02:18:38,505 --> 02:18:39,885
Come on.
Just a minute.

1354
02:18:40,045 --> 02:18:42,255
I think this means a whole lot to her.

1355
02:18:42,425 --> 02:18:44,885
You have no idea how much
it means to me...

1356
02:18:45,055 --> 02:18:48,975
...to be able to settle down
to a life of peace and quiet.

1357
02:18:49,145 --> 02:18:50,555
I'll get the luggage.

1358
02:18:53,855 --> 02:18:55,895
Hello, boys.

1359
02:18:56,065 --> 02:18:57,815
Jake.

1360
02:18:58,145 --> 02:18:59,235
Tom.

1361
02:18:59,405 --> 02:19:01,115
Pablo.

1362
02:19:11,325 --> 02:19:13,745
Zeb. Let's go.

1363
02:19:13,915 --> 02:19:20,005
Now, marshal, don't tell me you come
all the way to Gold City just to meet me?

1364
02:19:20,175 --> 02:19:22,755
I hardly expected it.

1365
02:19:23,175 --> 02:19:27,135
And the beautiful... Mrs. Rawlings?

1366
02:19:27,305 --> 02:19:29,265
What a pleasure.

1367
02:19:29,435 --> 02:19:33,765
I envy you, marshal.
A well-favored, bright-eyed wife...

1368
02:19:33,935 --> 02:19:37,775
...just as dazzling as that sun up there.

1369
02:19:38,695 --> 02:19:41,105
Makes you almost thankful, don't it?

1370
02:19:41,275 --> 02:19:43,945
It makes a person wanna live.

1371
02:19:50,285 --> 02:19:51,875
That's Charlie Gant.

1372
02:19:52,035 --> 02:19:54,415
I thought you said he was in Montana.

1373
02:19:54,585 --> 02:19:56,245
Zeb?

1374
02:19:56,415 --> 02:19:59,215
I'm just gonna get the luggage, that's all.

1375
02:20:08,305 --> 02:20:09,885
See to the rooms, will you, Julie?

1376
02:20:10,055 --> 02:20:12,685
- Prescott, take care of the horses.
- Yes, sir.

1377
02:20:12,845 --> 02:20:16,265
- Linus, help your mother.
- Yes, sir.

1378
02:20:22,565 --> 02:20:24,615
Anything wrong, Julie?

1379
02:20:24,775 --> 02:20:27,445
No. No, nothing.

1380
02:20:27,615 --> 02:20:29,745
Come on, Eve.

1381
02:20:36,085 --> 02:20:38,585
- Lou.
- Zeb.

1382
02:20:38,755 --> 02:20:40,255
Got a minute?

1383
02:20:40,415 --> 02:20:42,425
Of course I got a minute.

1384
02:20:44,215 --> 02:20:45,715
Here.

1385
02:20:45,885 --> 02:20:48,425
Now, I urge you,
most respectfully to peruse the...

1386
02:20:48,595 --> 02:20:51,225
- Cigar?
- No, thanks.

1387
02:20:51,595 --> 02:20:53,935
Well, what can I do for you?

1388
02:20:55,435 --> 02:20:56,765
Go ahead, name it.

1389
02:20:56,935 --> 02:20:59,775
I saw Gant get off the train this morning.

1390
02:20:59,935 --> 02:21:02,485
There were three men waiting for him.

1391
02:21:05,565 --> 02:21:08,025
That's why you're here, huh?

1392
02:21:08,535 --> 02:21:10,405
That's it.

1393
02:21:12,405 --> 02:21:14,785
Look, there ain't a thing we can do...

1394
02:21:14,955 --> 02:21:19,545
...to keep Charlie Gant from going
where he wants to in this territory.

1395
02:21:20,335 --> 02:21:24,045
I know. I know what he was...

1396
02:21:24,295 --> 02:21:26,465
...but that's over now.

1397
02:21:26,925 --> 02:21:29,345
It was over the day his brother got...

1398
02:21:31,265 --> 02:21:34,305
Should've killed them both
that day, but...

1399
02:21:34,805 --> 02:21:38,015
Well, you didn't.
There ain't a thing I can do about it now.

1400
02:21:38,185 --> 02:21:40,935
What's he doing here, Lou?
Ain't you even curious?

1401
02:21:41,105 --> 02:21:44,605
Well, what do you want me to do?
Run him out of town at the point of a gun?

1402
02:21:44,775 --> 02:21:47,315
Do you think we still put the law
inside a holster here?

1403
02:21:47,485 --> 02:21:50,575
Look over there, Zeb. There's the law.

1404
02:21:50,735 --> 02:21:53,995
With all its writs and decrees and...

1405
02:21:54,495 --> 02:21:58,165
- We abide by that circuit judge now.
- How many get killed meantime?

1406
02:21:58,325 --> 02:22:00,245
Nobody's got killed. Nobody's going to.

1407
02:22:00,415 --> 02:22:03,665
Doc Holliday, the Clantons, the Youngers...

1408
02:22:04,125 --> 02:22:08,175
- They're all gone now.
- Charlie Gant ain't gone.

1409
02:22:09,135 --> 02:22:12,135
You get me a warrant. I'll get you Gant.

1410
02:22:12,385 --> 02:22:16,225
Lou? They want three guards in the wagon
with the gold shipment tomorrow.

1411
02:22:16,385 --> 02:22:21,015
- Three?
- This is a big one. Over $100,000 worth.

1412
02:22:21,185 --> 02:22:24,105
I'll take Clayton and Sims with me,
all right?

1413
02:22:28,615 --> 02:22:30,115
Well?

1414
02:22:30,275 --> 02:22:32,155
Well what?

1415
02:22:32,365 --> 02:22:34,495
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

1416
02:22:34,655 --> 02:22:38,035
- It means we put on a three-man guard.
- To the train.

1417
02:22:38,205 --> 02:22:40,375
What happens then?

1418
02:22:40,535 --> 02:22:43,125
You know there's gold going out here
every month or so.

1419
02:22:43,295 --> 02:22:46,915
There hasn't been a train robbery
since Jesse James was killed.

1420
02:22:47,875 --> 02:22:50,885
Now, if the councilors
wish to have a conference, we'll have one.

1421
02:22:51,045 --> 02:22:52,555
Zeb.

1422
02:22:54,015 --> 02:22:57,975
I don't want any trouble here now.
We've been friends a long time.

1423
02:22:58,685 --> 02:23:00,765
As a friend...

1424
02:23:00,935 --> 02:23:02,975
...I'd like you to leave town.

1425
02:23:25,125 --> 02:23:27,415
Boys, get back from there.

1426
02:23:30,335 --> 02:23:32,095
Look down there, son.

1427
02:23:32,255 --> 02:23:34,805
- Do you know how deep that shaft is?
- Uh-uh.

1428
02:23:34,965 --> 02:23:36,845
That's a thousand foot deep.

1429
02:23:37,015 --> 02:23:38,595
Do you know how deep
a thousand foot is?

1430
02:23:38,765 --> 02:23:39,765
Uh-uh.

1431
02:23:39,935 --> 02:23:44,105
Well, if you had 200 brothers,
all standing on your shoulders...

1432
02:23:44,265 --> 02:23:48,275
...you wouldn't be able to see over the top.
- I'd be squished.

1433
02:23:48,435 --> 02:23:52,025
Come on.
I'll show you boys the donkey engine.

1434
02:23:57,285 --> 02:24:00,575
You boys go ahead.
I'll be along in a minute.

1435
02:24:03,285 --> 02:24:06,795
I hear you've been talking
to the local marshal about me.

1436
02:24:08,625 --> 02:24:12,755
- Would you call that friendly?
- I never considered us exactly friendly.

1437
02:24:13,175 --> 02:24:15,345
I don't like you, marshal.

1438
02:24:15,505 --> 02:24:19,385
I don't like what you and your kind
are doing to this country.

1439
02:24:19,885 --> 02:24:21,765
Now, I don't want any trouble.

1440
02:24:21,935 --> 02:24:26,435
But you wanna put things on the old basis,
just you and me?

1441
02:24:26,605 --> 02:24:28,935
That's fine.

1442
02:24:29,105 --> 02:24:32,155
I'm not gonna
get in a fight with you, Gant.

1443
02:24:32,985 --> 02:24:35,575
It's peace you want, huh, marshal?

1444
02:24:35,735 --> 02:24:37,155
Peace?

1445
02:24:37,325 --> 02:24:40,155
There's only one kind I know of.

1446
02:24:40,865 --> 02:24:43,035
That's the kind my brother's got.

1447
02:24:43,285 --> 02:24:46,995
What happened to your brother
didn't teach you very much, did it?

1448
02:24:47,165 --> 02:24:49,505
Easy, marshal.

1449
02:24:49,795 --> 02:24:51,505
Floyd never made mistakes...

1450
02:24:51,665 --> 02:24:54,885
...except the one time he trusted you.

1451
02:24:55,045 --> 02:24:56,925
And you're the one that got away.

1452
02:25:00,725 --> 02:25:03,975
One of these days, I'm likely
to pay you Rawlingses a little visit.

1453
02:25:31,085 --> 02:25:33,295
Come on, move along.

1454
02:25:33,465 --> 02:25:35,795
Get those gold boxes up there.

1455
02:25:35,965 --> 02:25:38,095
That's a lot of gold.

1456
02:25:38,255 --> 02:25:40,845
Come on, keep moving, boys.

1457
02:25:43,225 --> 02:25:44,555
Zeb?

1458
02:25:44,725 --> 02:25:47,015
Lou Ramsey's here.

1459
02:25:48,935 --> 02:25:50,565
Lou.

1460
02:25:51,185 --> 02:25:54,025
- I warned you, Zeb.
- What is it?

1461
02:25:54,195 --> 02:25:56,485
Gant came to see me last night.

1462
02:25:56,655 --> 02:25:59,615
Said you tried to start
some trouble with him.

1463
02:25:59,775 --> 02:26:01,365
You believe him?

1464
02:26:01,535 --> 02:26:04,785
I'm telling you, Zeb,
you take your trouble to your own territory.

1465
02:26:04,955 --> 02:26:06,495
I don't want any more of it here.

1466
02:26:09,745 --> 02:26:13,415
There won't be any more trouble, Lou.
Gant's gone.

1467
02:26:13,585 --> 02:26:16,045
Rode out of here early this morning.

1468
02:26:16,335 --> 02:26:17,425
With who?

1469
02:26:17,585 --> 02:26:19,425
His gang.

1470
02:26:19,925 --> 02:26:24,385
They should be somewhere
between here and Kingman...

1471
02:26:24,555 --> 02:26:25,765
...waiting on that train.

1472
02:26:26,265 --> 02:26:28,015
You don't fool me for a minute, Zeb.

1473
02:26:28,185 --> 02:26:30,895
You are not looking for a robbery,
you're looking for Gant.

1474
02:26:31,065 --> 02:26:34,275
You still carry lead where he shot you.
That was Texas.

1475
02:26:34,435 --> 02:26:37,775
And Oklahoma, where you killed Floyd.
And now this.

1476
02:26:39,985 --> 02:26:42,025
I'm sorry, Julie...

1477
02:26:42,195 --> 02:26:45,745
...but I don't want my office
to be any part of this.

1478
02:26:55,585 --> 02:26:56,625
Zeb?

1479
02:26:56,795 --> 02:26:59,255
The boys have got the team hitched.

1480
02:26:59,755 --> 02:27:01,175
I know.

1481
02:27:01,345 --> 02:27:03,505
It's almost time to go.

1482
02:27:07,555 --> 02:27:09,305
Zeb?

1483
02:27:33,165 --> 02:27:36,085
- Julie.
- No one's asking you to face Gant.

1484
02:27:36,255 --> 02:27:38,005
No one's making you.

1485
02:27:38,165 --> 02:27:41,255
We could ride out of here right now.
We could forget it.

1486
02:27:45,005 --> 02:27:48,475
Maybe there's
something you haven't told me.

1487
02:27:48,975 --> 02:27:50,845
Is there, Zeb?

1488
02:27:54,855 --> 02:27:57,775
I'm asking you not to go.

1489
02:27:58,435 --> 02:28:00,195
Please.

1490
02:28:00,525 --> 02:28:02,945
Don't go.

1491
02:28:04,115 --> 02:28:05,445
Sorry, Julie.

1492
02:28:23,215 --> 02:28:29,055
I guess there's nothing more pigheaded
in a man than his sense of honor.

1493
02:28:29,225 --> 02:28:32,975
They're all the same, every one of them.

1494
02:28:33,145 --> 02:28:35,225
You take my Cleve now.

1495
02:28:35,395 --> 02:28:37,855
Never could turn down a poker game.

1496
02:28:38,025 --> 02:28:40,145
Felt duty-bound to go.

1497
02:28:40,315 --> 02:28:42,855
Three nights running sometimes,
but he wouldn't quit...

1498
02:28:43,025 --> 02:28:46,115
...not if his life depended on it. He...

1499
02:28:47,615 --> 02:28:49,495
I guess it isn't very funny.

1500
02:28:49,655 --> 02:28:51,285
Ma?

1501
02:28:51,655 --> 02:28:52,705
Where's Pa?

1502
02:28:52,865 --> 02:28:55,375
Out. That's where he is.
- What's the matter with Mom?

1503
02:28:55,535 --> 02:28:58,335
Nothing's the matter.
Come on, now, in the other room.

1504
02:28:58,495 --> 02:29:00,625
- What's the matter?
Come on, we're gonna play.

1505
02:29:00,795 --> 02:29:02,425
That's a good girl. That's better.

1506
02:29:02,585 --> 02:29:05,085
What's the matter with Mama?
- Nothing's the matter.

1507
02:29:05,255 --> 02:29:06,385
Do you know any games?

1508
02:29:06,545 --> 02:29:08,465
We know tag.
Musical chairs.

1509
02:29:08,635 --> 02:29:10,385
- Ugh. Tag.
- I know hide-and-seek.

1510
02:29:10,555 --> 02:29:12,265
Well, do you know how to play poker?

1511
02:29:12,435 --> 02:29:13,435
- Poker?
- Poker?

1512
02:29:13,595 --> 02:29:17,305
You're in luck. Sit down right there.
Now, come on, sit down. That's it.

1513
02:29:17,565 --> 02:29:19,355
But we don't know how to play poker.

1514
02:29:19,525 --> 02:29:21,855
Well, it's time you learned.

1515
02:29:22,025 --> 02:29:25,695
First, we'll start off
with a little five-card stud.

1516
02:29:44,125 --> 02:29:46,295
I'll take that rifle, Zeb.

1517
02:29:46,465 --> 02:29:47,635
Your pistol too.

1518
02:29:50,965 --> 02:29:52,845
Sorry, Lou.

1519
02:29:53,225 --> 02:29:54,595
I just can't oblige.

1520
02:30:04,105 --> 02:30:06,445
Thought the law wouldn't let you
use that anymore.

1521
02:30:07,525 --> 02:30:09,155
I'll use it if I have to.

1522
02:30:09,735 --> 02:30:12,995
I'm going out of here, Lou,
and I'm taking this with me.

1523
02:30:13,495 --> 02:30:14,995
To kill Gant.

1524
02:30:15,155 --> 02:30:17,115
That's what you think, isn't it?

1525
02:30:17,285 --> 02:30:19,995
It's something personal
between him and me.

1526
02:30:20,165 --> 02:30:22,505
Well, Lou, it could be...

1527
02:30:22,665 --> 02:30:26,085
...if I settle down with my family
and wait for him to come.

1528
02:30:26,255 --> 02:30:29,795
And he'll come
if I don't stop him here and now.

1529
02:30:29,965 --> 02:30:33,515
I'm gonna catch Gant red-handed,
breaking the law...

1530
02:30:33,675 --> 02:30:37,515
...and then I'm gonna use the law
to put him away once and for all.

1531
02:30:37,685 --> 02:30:38,935
The law, Lou.

1532
02:30:39,395 --> 02:30:41,185
I'm gonna use the law...

1533
02:30:41,355 --> 02:30:44,235
...but I haven't got much chance
without your help.

1534
02:31:09,715 --> 02:31:11,345
How many men in the caboose?

1535
02:31:11,505 --> 02:31:12,885
Just one brakeman.

1536
02:31:13,055 --> 02:31:16,345
- Is he armed?
- No, never has been.

1537
02:31:16,515 --> 02:31:18,725
I'll be in the express car.

1538
02:31:24,435 --> 02:31:25,725
Thanks, Lou.

1539
02:31:25,895 --> 02:31:29,735
Marshal?
There's some riders up ahead.

1540
02:31:30,565 --> 02:31:32,905
I'll take a look.

1541
02:31:52,795 --> 02:31:55,345
Engineer, there's a barricade ahead!

1542
02:31:55,505 --> 02:31:57,265
Open it up, wide open.

1543
02:32:23,325 --> 02:32:24,785
Zeb!

1544
02:32:24,955 --> 02:32:27,955
Come on. Come on.

1545
02:32:47,855 --> 02:32:49,815
Everyone make it?
- Frenchy's horse fell.

1546
02:32:49,985 --> 02:32:52,025
- I don't think he made it.
- Well, let's move.

1547
02:32:52,195 --> 02:32:54,155
It's a long way from here to that gold.

1548
02:32:54,315 --> 02:32:56,155
There's no danger. Just keep going.

1549
02:33:14,505 --> 02:33:16,505
It's Rawlings.

1550
02:34:47,345 --> 02:34:48,935
Back this train up!

1551
02:34:49,095 --> 02:34:50,305
And fast!

1552
02:37:17,285 --> 02:37:19,085
How come we're leaving so early, Pa?

1553
02:37:19,245 --> 02:37:22,005
We got a long way to go, son.

1554
02:37:22,165 --> 02:37:23,755
Here.

1555
02:37:27,345 --> 02:37:29,515
Auntie, when we going to your house?

1556
02:37:29,675 --> 02:37:31,885
Your daddy will decide
when we get to your home.

1557
02:37:32,055 --> 02:37:33,595
Auntie, can we take Sam with us?

1558
02:37:33,765 --> 02:37:36,605
I think Sam is taking us.

1559
02:37:58,335 --> 02:38:00,955
Pa, how much further is it
to Aunt Lilith's ranch?

1560
02:38:01,125 --> 02:38:04,505
Well, son, it's around the next bend,
the next bend...

1561
02:38:04,675 --> 02:38:07,135
...and the valley beyond.
- Oh.

1562
02:38:10,215 --> 02:38:13,725
- Aunt Lilith, do you know that song?
LINUS: That's our song.

1563
02:38:13,885 --> 02:38:15,305
Your song?

1564
02:38:15,475 --> 02:38:19,565
I sang that song
long before your pa was ever born.

1565
02:38:24,065 --> 02:38:25,065
Come on.

1566
02:38:31,195 --> 02:38:32,825
Zeb.

1567
02:39:06,695 --> 02:39:13,195
<i>The West that was won by its pioneers,</i>
<i>settlers, adventurers is long gone now.</i>

1568
02:39:13,365 --> 02:39:15,825
<i>Yet it is theirs forever.</i>

1569
02:39:15,995 --> 02:39:20,575
<i>For they left tracks in history</i>
<i>that will never be eroded by wind or rain...</i>

1570
02:39:20,745 --> 02:39:26,415
<i>... never plowed under by tractors,</i>
<i>never buried in the compost of events.</i>

1571
02:39:27,005 --> 02:39:30,715
<i>Out of the hard simplicity of their lives,</i>
<i>out of their vitality...</i>

1572
02:39:30,885 --> 02:39:33,385
<i>... their hopes and their sorrows...</i>

1573
02:39:33,555 --> 02:39:35,555
<i>... grew legends of courage and pride...</i>

1574
02:39:35,715 --> 02:39:39,555
<i>... to inspire their children</i>
<i>and their children's children.</i>

1575
02:39:40,225 --> 02:39:42,645
<i>From soil enriched by their blood...</i>

1576
02:39:42,805 --> 02:39:45,605
<i>... out of their fever to explore and build...</i>

1577
02:39:45,775 --> 02:39:49,065
<i>... came lakes where once</i>
<i>were burning deserts...</i>

1578
02:39:49,315 --> 02:39:52,735
<i>... came the goods of the earth,</i>
<i>mines and wheat fields...</i>

1579
02:39:52,905 --> 02:39:55,365
<i>... orchards and great lumber mills...</i>

1580
02:39:55,535 --> 02:39:58,865
<i>... all the sinews of a growing country.</i>

1581
02:40:00,115 --> 02:40:04,085
<i>Out of their rude settlements,</i>
<i>their trading posts, came cities...</i>

1582
02:40:04,245 --> 02:40:07,255
<i>... to rank among the great ones</i>
<i>of the world.</i>

1583
02:40:07,415 --> 02:40:10,545
<i>All the heritage of a people</i>
<i>free to dream...</i>

1584
02:40:10,715 --> 02:40:15,255
<i>... free to act,</i>
<i>free to mold their own destiny.</i>
