- Oh, good. Excuse me.

167
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,206
Oh, Dr. Schlick was so right.

168
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:47,609
I'm really ready for a ripe,
mature relationship now.

169
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,671
Is that why you married me?

170
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:53,412
- Just a prescription from your analyst?
- Don't be silly, darling.

171
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,977
I can hardly wait to get to Monterey.

172
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,023
Uh, you'll have to.

173
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,787
The State Highway Commission frowns
on commencing a honeymoon in a vehicle.

174
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,852
- Hmm?
- It's a moving violation.

175
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,863
[Chuckling]

176
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,001
Thank you very much.

177
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,115
Thank the whole United States Navy!

178
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,831
- [ Girl] It's your turn.
- [ Girl #2] I can beat you.!

179
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,874
- No, you can't.!
- Yes, I can!

180
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,910
- You missed! You missed!
- I did not.

181
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,969
You did too.
You stepped right on the crack.

182
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,413
I did not. Anyway, you made me.

183
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,713
You have to start over again.

184
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:04,119
You splashed water in my eyes.
No fair.!

185
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,802
Stop splashing.

186
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,861
That's no fair.

187
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,887
- Hello.
- Hello.

188
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,691
- Hi.
- Shh.

189
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,818
I'm walking a tightrope.

190
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,692
Oh, well, I see you are,
and you're doing very nicely.

191
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,857
Who are you?

192
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,631
I don't think you remember me,
but I remember you.

193
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,570
Are you a lady or a man?

194
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,478
- I used to be a lady.
- [ Older Girl] Are you a sailor?

195
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,480
Well, not really, no.

196
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,608
Some sailors helped Daddy
look for our mother once.

197
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,675
She drowned, in the ocean.

198
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:10,483
- Did she?
- Long time ago.

199
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,719
We're the only one in our whole school
who has a "drownded" mother.

200
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:21,732
[Chuckles, Sniffs]
Would you like to have her back?

201
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,994
Can't have her back. She's "drownded."

202
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,096
Like this- glug, glug, glug.

203
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,404
[ Water Bubbling]

204
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,373
[Sighs]

205
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:38,348
Um, tell me something.
Do you miss her?

206
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:42,717
Every Easter, Daddy takes us
to put flowers on her grave.

207
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,722
Her grave?

208
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,782
Don't be sad. She's not in the grave.

209
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,352
She's at the bottom of the ocean-
the deepest part.

210
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,660
Oh, I know.

211
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:56,724
Tell me about your school,
what you do and everything.

212
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:00,260
We're not supposed
to talk to strangers.

213
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,365
L- I'm not really a stranger.
I know your daddy.

214
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,774
- Our grandma too?
- Yes.

215
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,372
- She's inside.
- Well, first I wanted to see you.

216
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:14,078
- What for?
- Because I heard that you were both so pretty.

217
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,880
And you are so pretty.

218
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,958
Are you gonna cry?

219
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,660
She was crying, that lady.

220
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,400
- She was not.
- She was so.

221
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,374
Aw, she's just goofy.

222
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,773

we are going to have for dinner.

- In the freezer.

225
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,083

00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,896
- Listen carefully, Mari-
- Oh.

We're going to have chicken,
you know?

229
00:15:01,632 --> 00:15:03,566

00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:13,636
And there will be a man.

- Come here. Aqui.
- Aqui?

235
00:15:17,748 --> 00:15:20,148
To wash the windows.

Sabe "wash windows"?

00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:25,544
- "Weendows"?
- Si. "Weendows."

238
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:28,922
Wash the "weendows."

00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,393
Oh. Here he is now.
I'll tell him myself.

248

Oh, come on. Let me help you up.

261

to break it to you gently...

and then on a submarine.

- Submarine?
- I'll tell you about it later.

Well, then what are you crying about?

277
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,384
Well, it's gonna be such a shock to him
to find out you're back.

278
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:45,121
Oh, I know it is, and we've got to
figure out a way to tell him.

279
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:48,187
- Yes.
- What am I gonna do?
Maybe I should call the office.

- Oh.
- I want to call him right now.

Of course not, and I didn't know
how to tell them without Nicky.

290
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:21,327
- Where is he?
- Uh, perhaps first you'd better take a bath.

00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:23,628
- I don't want a bath!
- Well, take one anyway.

- Are you hiding something from me?
- Hiding? Oh!

get you that drink.

Five years is a long time, darling.

00:19:44,614 --> 00:19:48,516
Can't expect a healthy man
to wait forever.

311
00:19:50,654 --> 00:19:53,316
Just how long did he wait?

312
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,984

00:20:06,603 --> 00:20:09,401
Calling the airline,
get you out on the next flight.

318
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:13,272
- What flight? Where?
- You'll be at the hotel before they arrive.

319
00:20:13,343 --> 00:20:17,336
- I can't do that, Grace!
- Why can't you? You're his wife.

320
00:20:17,414 --> 00:20:19,712
- So is she.
- She's his bride.

321
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,808
- What's the difference?
- A honeymoon.

322
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:25,184
And you're not
gonna let them have one.

323
00:20:25,255 --> 00:20:27,849
But first we gotta find you
something to wear...

324
00:20:27,924 --> 00:20:30,791
then I'll call
for the next flight to Monterey.

325
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,794
- Monterey?
- Yeah.

326
00:20:32,862 --> 00:20:36,025
- You mean he's taking her to our hotel?
- Yes.

327
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:38,829
Doesn't that make you fighting mad?

328
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:48,043
Oh, no.

329
00:20:51,214 --> 00:20:54,012
I think that's terribly sweet.

Oh, brother. You have been away.

331
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,112
Oh, we had such
a lovely honeymoon there.

Keep the change.

- Uh, yes, ma'am?
- Pardon me. Has Mr. Nicholas Arden arrived yet?

No, please. Leave the makeup kit
straight up, quickly.

a reservation for me-Arden.

- Yes, Mr. Codd.
- "A"? Don't you have something else?

346
00:22:57,374 --> 00:23:01,606
- Well, it's our very best.
After all, the honeymoon-
- I know, but I can't.

347
00:23:01,678 --> 00:23:04,408
I mean, I'd rather not.
You must have something else.

348
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:08,144

and it hasn't been redecorated as late-

to be nervous. I'm the bride.

You shave here, and I'll watch.

I mean, it's the massage.

- The minute? Well-

00:34:40,343 --> 00:34:44,677
He certainly can, if he loves
his dead wife who's come back.

505
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:46,682
If he loves her?

506
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:51,512
Now, that hurts, Ellen.
That really hurts.

507
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:57,426
Y-You wouldn't say that...

508
00:34:57,494 --> 00:35:01,555
if-if you'd seen the memorial service
we had for you.

509
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:03,565
Memorial service?

510
00:35:04,801 --> 00:35:07,292
There were over 200 people there.

511
00:35:10,473 --> 00:35:14,170
It was the most beautiful service
that I've ever attended.

512
00:35:14,244 --> 00:35:16,178
Really?

513
00:35:16,246 --> 00:35:21,183
L- l-I sent a blanket of carnations...

514
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:23,378
that covered the whole altar.

515
00:35:25,388 --> 00:35:27,322

517
00:35:31,895 --> 00:35:34,125
Your color- pink.

518
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:37,659
Pink.

519
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:40,430
After the choir sang...

520
00:35:40,503 --> 00:35:43,301
a hush fell over
the- the whole church...

521
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:46,672
as Dr. Slocum came forward
to deliver the eulogy.

522
00:35:48,912 --> 00:35:50,903
What did he say?

523
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,073
Oh, what every one of us knew.

524
00:35:53,149 --> 00:35:56,983
That you were an angel on Earth...

525
00:35:57,053 --> 00:36:00,887
a wonderful mother, a devoted wife...

Oh, Nicky. Really?

529
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,734
Me?

530
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:15,794
There wasn't a dry eye
in the congregation.

531
00:36:15,872 --> 00:36:18,272
Oh. Gosh, I wish I'd been there.

532
00:36:19,976 --> 00:36:23,309

there wouldn't have been a service.

00:36:35,658 --> 00:36:39,651
Um, what about the, um...

538
00:36:41,898 --> 00:36:45,390
- What about it?
- It was $100,000, wasn't it?

539
00:36:45,468 --> 00:36:47,527
No, 50. I'm a hundred.

540
00:36:47,604 --> 00:36:50,835
Oh. Did you collect it?

541
00:36:50,907 --> 00:36:52,841
Not yet.

542
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:56,310
You weren't legally dead
until this morning.

543
00:36:56,379 --> 00:36:58,711
And you didn't claim it right away.

544
00:36:58,782 --> 00:37:01,410
Well, I never even thought about it.

- Well, what is it?

549
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:20,492
Mr. Arden, as a resident manager
of this hotel...

550
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:24,062
I find it my duty to inform you
that when a man takes a room here...

551
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,665
we expect him to go to that room
with his own wife.

552
00:37:26,743 --> 00:37:29,541
We do not expect that wife
to be paging him constantly...

553
00:37:29,612 --> 00:37:32,103
when he is next door
dallying with another woman.

554
00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:35,709
Dallying? Oh, he's not dallying.

555
00:37:35,785 --> 00:37:38,117
- Please, madam, do not interfere-
- Mr. Codd.

556
00:37:38,188 --> 00:37:41,055
- We will not be made a party to intrigue.
- Oh, now wait a minute!

557
00:37:41,124 --> 00:37:45,060
This establishment's maintained
a reputation for respectability for 25 years.

558
00:37:45,128 --> 00:37:47,460
We do not intend
to lose it in one night.

559
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,227
Well, you could lose more than your reputation
with that kind of loose talk.

560
00:37:51,301 --> 00:37:53,235
Loose? My dear sir...

561

as a hotel manager
of many years experience...

562
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:58,636
I can sniff hanky-panky
in an air-conditioned building.

563
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:01,040
Hanky-panky? You get out of here.

564
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:04,102
I am leaving. I am leaving.
There's only one thing we ask.

565
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:07,240
That you restrict yourself
to one suite, one wife.

00:38:07,317 --> 00:38:09,649
- That's the American way.
- Right.

00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:13,246
- Ellen!
- I absolutely agree.

568
00:38:13,323 --> 00:38:15,917
Oh? Fine.

569
00:38:15,992 --> 00:38:17,983
Then you'll leave?

570
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:21,087
Leave? Why should I leave?
I'm Mrs. Arden.

00:38:21,164 --> 00:38:23,098
- You are?
- Yes.

572

Tell him, darling.

573
00:38:30,006 --> 00:38:34,375
And you allowed your husband to register
in this hotel with another woman?

574
00:38:34,444 --> 00:38:36,878
- Why do you think I'm here?
- Oh, Ellen. Stop it!

575
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:40,438
Unless I'm very much mistaken,
you registered the first one as Mrs. Arden...

00:38:40,517 --> 00:38:42,747

- He-

I don't know what you two-
or you three- think you're doing...

00:38:50,593 --> 00:38:54,256
but I insist that one of your women
leave this hotel at once!

580
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,890

It's really a very simple situation.

You see, my wife- my bride-
She's my wife.

584
00:39:04,073 --> 00:39:07,065
What my husband is trying to tell you
is that he has two wives.

585
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:09,634
- Yes!
- I don't care if he has 10 wives.

586
00:39:09,712 --> 00:39:12,704
As long as he's in this hotel,
he will have only one wife-

587
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:15,774
the one that he registered here
as his wife- his first wife.

588
00:39:15,852 --> 00:39:17,786
- His second wife?
- You're confused.

- Yes!
- I can explain it.

- I'll be right back.

- [Kissing]
- Not while I'm manager here.

- Mrs. Arden.
- Yes?

been so humiliated in my whole life!

Oh, now, Bianca. I was down in the lobby,
and I ran into someone.

here all alone for some old army buddy!

842
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,554
Darling,
do you remember that song?

843
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:39,191
- I heard it someplace.
- Where?

844
00:55:39,267 --> 00:55:42,566
On the radio, I think.
I don't like it.

845
00:55:42,637 --> 00:55:45,197
Oh.

846
00:55:46,841 --> 00:55:48,775
Are you gonna stay here?

847
00:55:48,843 --> 00:55:51,073
Would you like me to?

848
00:55:51,145 --> 00:55:53,375
Where would you sleep?

849
00:55:54,382 --> 00:55:57,010
Well, in the guest room.

850
00:55:57,084 --> 00:55:59,211
Bianca's gonna sleep there.

851
00:55:59,287 --> 00:56:04,418
No, she's gonna sleep in Daddy's room
because she's our new mother.

852
00:56:04,492 --> 00:56:07,325
I don't want her to.

853
00:56:07,395 --> 00:56:09,329
Don't you want a mother?

854
00:56:09,397 --> 00:56:11,729
- No. Just Daddy.
- Yeah.

855
00:56:19,273 --> 00:56:21,264
Good night.

856
00:56:31,752 --> 00:56:33,686
Good night.

857
00:56:38,292 --> 00:56:41,693
Moo! Moo!

858
00:56:43,698 --> 00:56:45,632
[Swishing]

859
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,930
- Ah! Leche.
- Leche.

860
00:56:48,002 --> 00:56:51,369
- Si, senora. [Spanish]
- Grace. Grace.

861
00:56:51,439 --> 00:56:54,237
You'd better start studying Spanish,
or learn to play charades.

862
00:56:54,308 --> 00:56:57,903
- Who was that on the phone?
- Oh. Yeah, sit down, Ellen.

863
00:56:57,979 --> 00:57:00,277
It was Nick.
He's not coming home.

864
00:57:00,348 --> 00:57:03,408
- He is coming home.
- Well- Oh, then he told her.

865
00:57:03,484 --> 00:57:06,578
- Grace, he told her.
- Actually, it was Bianca who called.

866
00:57:06,654 --> 00:57:09,521
- Bianca?
- Now, don't get excited, honey.

867
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:12,423
Nick's had a little accident.
N-Nothing serious.

868
00:57:12,493 --> 00:57:15,155
- He hurt his back.
- His back?

869
00:57:16,497 --> 00:57:19,159
He could've slipped or something.

870
00:57:19,233 --> 00:57:21,428
Well, he could have.

871
00:57:21,502 --> 00:57:23,561
And they'll be here
first thing tomorrow morning.

872
00:57:24,905 --> 00:57:26,896
- You mean he's gonna bring that woman here?
- Shh!

873
00:57:26,974 --> 00:57:29,442
- In my house?
- Simmer down, Ellen.

874
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:32,377
- You'll upset the children
and make a worse mess of things.
- Oh!

875
00:57:32,446 --> 00:57:34,573
There must be some way
to handle this.

876
00:57:34,649 --> 00:57:37,049
What do you want me to do,
hide in the attic?

877
00:57:37,118 --> 00:57:40,212
Don't be silly.
There's a very simple solution.

878
00:57:40,288 --> 00:57:43,553
- What?
- You can go to a hotel for a couple of days.

879
00:57:43,624 --> 00:57:45,956
- I will not be thrown out of my own house!
- Shh!

880
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:48,222
This is as much my house
as it is his.

881
00:57:48,296 --> 00:57:50,321
- How can we explain your being here?
- [ Maria] Leche!

882
00:57:50,398 --> 00:57:52,992
[Spanish]

883
00:57:53,067 --> 00:57:57,367
- Gracias.
- Por nada. Por nada. Por nada. por nada.

884
00:57:57,438 --> 00:57:59,929
Why don't you let her go
and make me the cook?

885
00:58:00,007 --> 00:58:03,534
Oh, I can think of some lovely dishes
to make for them.

886
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:06,637
No, dear. We'd better think
of something else.

887
00:58:21,128 --> 00:58:25,326
Jenny! Jenny!

888
00:58:25,399 --> 00:58:27,833
You forgot your sweater!

889
00:58:27,902 --> 00:58:29,870
Oh, dear.

890
00:58:34,575 --> 00:58:36,509
Ellen!

891
00:58:40,781 --> 00:58:42,715
Ellen?

892
00:58:43,951 --> 00:58:46,249
Ellen! They're here.

893
00:59:06,273 --> 00:59:09,868
For heaven's sakes, Nicky!
You look terrible.

894
00:59:09,944 --> 00:59:12,811
I feel terrible.

895
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,610
Well, don't you worry, Son.
We'll take care of you.

896
00:59:15,683 --> 00:59:17,617
Oh, I'll take care of him.

897
00:59:17,685 --> 00:59:22,145
[ With Swedish Accent]
No. I will be the one to take care.

898
00:59:22,223 --> 00:59:25,158
- Who's that?
- Uh, that's Miss Svensson.

899
00:59:25,226 --> 00:59:27,353
- Uh, she's Swedish.
- Svensson?

900
00:59:27,428 --> 00:59:30,363
Uh, the nurse I engaged for you.

901
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:33,332
Ja. My name is Greta Svensson.

902
00:59:33,401 --> 00:59:37,303
Is Swedish name. You call me Greta.

903
00:59:37,371 --> 00:59:39,737
Well, Nicholas doesn't need
a nurse, Mother Arden.

904
00:59:39,807 --> 00:59:42,901
- I'm gonna call Dr. Schlick for him.
- The psychiatrist?

905
00:59:42,977 --> 00:59:45,844
Oh, yes. I'm sure his trouble
is psychogenic.

906
00:59:45,913 --> 00:59:47,938
He has a deep-seated anxiety neurosis.

907
00:59:48,015 --> 00:59:49,949
[Normal Voice]
Deep-seated?

908
00:59:50,017 --> 00:59:52,247
[With Accent]
In his back?

909
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,651
Well, you see, l-
I just had an accident.

910
00:59:54,722 --> 00:59:57,816
I was running down some-well,
up some stairs- and I tripped and fell.

911
00:59:57,892 --> 01:00:00,360
- I had all my clothes on at the time!
- Uh, Nicholas, dear-

912
01:00:00,428 --> 01:00:03,090
It was early last night-very early-
just before dinner even.

913
01:00:03,164 --> 01:00:05,655
Darling, you don't have to explain
anything to Miss Svensson.

914
01:00:05,733 --> 01:00:08,463
- Oh, but I do. She's here to help me, isn't she?
- Oh, yes.

915
01:00:08,536 --> 01:00:11,664
Ooh, ja.
And give good Swedish massage.

916
01:00:11,739 --> 01:00:15,573
Don't worry, lady.
I fix his aching back. Uh, come.

917
01:00:15,643 --> 01:00:19,204
Uh, well, thank you. But first, would you
go out and bring our luggage in?

918
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,771
- Me?
- Well, of course you.

919
01:00:21,849 --> 01:00:23,817
Come, Nicholas.

920
01:00:25,152 --> 01:00:27,814
Darling, I've never seen
the bedrooms in this house.

921
01:00:27,888 --> 01:00:31,153
- How many have we?
- Not nearly enough.

922
01:00:31,225 --> 01:00:35,355
Oh! I'll be right up, dear,
as soon as I call Dr. Schlick.

923
01:00:41,001 --> 01:00:43,401
Just wait'll I get my hands on him.

924
01:00:43,471 --> 01:00:45,598
Now, now, Ellen. Temper, temper.

925
01:00:45,673 --> 01:00:48,403
Everything's working out just fine.

926
01:00:48,476 --> 01:00:51,968
Fine? How dare she come in here
and order me around!

927
01:00:52,046 --> 01:00:55,812
I'll have a little talk
with her about your duties.

928
01:00:55,883 --> 01:00:58,545
And I'll have a talk with him about his.

929
01:00:58,619 --> 01:01:02,817
Well, uh, when Dr. Schlick is free,
would you have him call me...

930
01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:07,554
at... 235-4505, please?

931
01:01:08,696 --> 01:01:11,187
Thank you.

932
01:01:11,265 --> 01:01:15,065
Mother Arden!
I thought the nurse was doing that.

933
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:19,834
She helped. But, uh, she's going
to give Nick his massage.

934
01:01:21,509 --> 01:01:23,443
Oh, here, Ellen. Here.

935
01:01:23,511 --> 01:01:25,638
- Let's talk-
- You just keep away from me.

936
01:01:25,713 --> 01:01:28,341
You had all night to tell her.
All night!

937
01:01:28,415 --> 01:01:30,815
I've tried to tell her, believe me. L-

938
01:01:30,885 --> 01:01:33,820
- Here, would you get me out of this straitjacket?
- Let her get you out.

939
01:01:33,888 --> 01:01:36,948
- She got you into it.
- Nobody got me into anything.

940
01:01:37,024 --> 01:01:40,755
Nothin' happened. Why do you think
I went to all this trouble?

941
01:01:40,828 --> 01:01:42,921
- Faking a bad back!
- Faking?

942
01:01:42,997 --> 01:01:45,898
I don't believe you.

943
01:01:45,966 --> 01:01:48,491
Here. Does it look like
I've got a sprained back?

944
01:01:52,406 --> 01:01:54,340
Nicholas!

945
01:01:56,577 --> 01:01:58,511
It works.
[Chuckles]

946
01:01:58,579 --> 01:02:01,013
- What works?
- Greta's massage.

947
01:02:01,081 --> 01:02:03,413
- So soon?
- Yeah, how about that?

948
01:02:03,484 --> 01:02:06,681
Oh, ja. Special Swedish massage.

949
01:02:06,754 --> 01:02:08,949
- Isn't she marvelous?
- Marvelous?

950
01:02:09,023 --> 01:02:10,957
It- It's almost a miracle.

951
01:02:11,025 --> 01:02:13,585
Was no miracle.
Was just the touch in fingers.

952
01:02:15,596 --> 01:02:17,530
Oh, I give you massage too.

953
01:02:17,598 --> 01:02:19,589
Very good after long drive.

954
01:02:19,667 --> 01:02:22,158
- Well, I don't know. I really don't usually-
- Oh, ja, ja.

955
01:02:22,236 --> 01:02:26,172
- I fix you just like husband.
- What?

956
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,606
Uh, Miss Svensson, uh-

957
01:02:28,676 --> 01:02:31,611
- I don't think that you-
- Oh, ja, ja, it be fine.

958
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:34,477
Give you chance
to talk with your son.

959
01:02:34,548 --> 01:02:36,982
- Oh, yes, see that he rests, Mother Arden.
- Come. Come.

960
01:02:37,051 --> 01:02:40,646
You must take off your clothes. Mmm.

961
01:02:40,721 --> 01:02:43,884
What's going on around here?
Where'd she ever get such an idea?

962
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:45,892
A nurse. And Swedish.

963
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,292
Necessity is the mother of invention...

964
01:02:48,362 --> 01:02:50,330
and I was the mother who invented it.

965
01:02:50,397 --> 01:02:52,365
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just a little.

966
01:02:52,433 --> 01:02:57,200
I can't quite seem to adjust to two
daughters-in-law for only one son.

967
01:02:57,271 --> 01:03:00,536
Well, as long as you had only one,
why did it have to be me?

968
01:03:00,608 --> 01:03:03,805
Ja. Lie down here on the bed, miss.

969
01:03:03,877 --> 01:03:05,811
It's missus.

970
01:03:07,348 --> 01:03:11,148
Your husband's mother tell me
you been Mr. Arden's second wife.

971
01:03:11,218 --> 01:03:13,584
Mm-hmm. He was a widower.

972
01:03:13,654 --> 01:03:15,178
- Ja.
- That's nice.

973
01:03:15,255 --> 01:03:18,918
His poor wife lost
in the airplane accident.

974
01:03:18,993 --> 01:03:22,622
- My mother-in-law likes to chat.
- Ja.

975
01:03:22,696 --> 01:03:25,130
I was thinking before-

976
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:29,568
What if Mr. Arden's
first wife didn't was dead?

977
01:03:29,637 --> 01:03:32,105
[Chuckles]
What an idea!

978
01:03:32,172 --> 01:03:35,733
When I was a little girl in Sweden,
I went once to the movies.

979
01:03:35,809 --> 01:03:38,835
Poor Cary Grant thought
his first wife was dead...

980
01:03:38,912 --> 01:03:41,847
so he married another lady.

981
01:03:41,915 --> 01:03:45,578
But Irene Dunne,
who was the first wife...

982
01:03:45,653 --> 01:03:48,383
she come back.

983
01:03:48,455 --> 01:03:51,117
Movies. When do movies
ever reflect real life?

984
01:03:51,191 --> 01:03:54,649
Ja. But suppose
Mr. Arden's first wife...

985
01:03:54,728 --> 01:03:58,255
was to come back
like Irene Dunne done- did.

986
01:03:58,332 --> 01:04:00,266
- What would happen?
- Nothing would happen.

987
01:04:00,334 --> 01:04:03,599
She'd still be legally dead
in the eyes of the law, and as long as she-

988
01:04:03,671 --> 01:04:06,003
Ow! Not- Not so hard!

989
01:04:06,073 --> 01:04:09,770
But if she was dead by law
and alive by everything else, then what?

990
01:04:09,843 --> 01:04:12,004
I couldn't care less.
Mr. Arden's mine now.

991
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:14,411
She'd just have to go back
to where she came from.

992
01:04:14,481 --> 01:04:15,778
- Ooh!
- Ow!

993
01:04:15,849 --> 01:04:18,579
- She would? She would?
- Ow! Ow!

994
01:04:18,652 --> 01:04:20,643
It's just what you need!

995
01:04:20,721 --> 01:04:22,655
- It's good for you!
- Stop it!

996
01:04:23,724 --> 01:04:26,318
All right, Mom. I'll tell her.

997
01:04:26,393 --> 01:04:28,554
About time.

998
01:04:30,631 --> 01:04:33,896
- First, I'd better have a cup of coffee.
- Oh, Nick.

999
01:04:33,967 --> 01:04:36,561
[ Bianca]
Ow.! Don't do that. Ouch.!

1000
01:04:36,637 --> 01:04:39,834
Stop that.! Nicholas. Help me.!

1001
01:04:39,907 --> 01:04:42,569
Is good special Swedish massage.!

1002
01:04:42,643 --> 01:04:46,044
I walk up and down your back!

1003
01:04:46,113 --> 01:04:48,411
On my back?

1004
01:04:48,482 --> 01:04:50,643
With your shoes on?

1005

Prokey's my name. Clyde Prokey.
I'm with American Accident and Life.

Hey, hey. This is quite a nice little place
you got here, Arden.

1027
01:05:49,042 --> 01:05:51,101
I don't have time to talk
about insurance this morning.

1028
01:05:51,178 --> 01:05:54,306
I'm not selling insurance, Mr. Arden.
I'm with the Claims Division.

- All my policies are with the Eastern Life-
- Not your signature, Mr. Arden.

01:06:01,889 --> 01:06:03,948
This is for Mrs. Arden. She here?

1033
01:06:04,024 --> 01:06:06,322
Well, which Mrs. Arden?

- Well, uh, my mother. And there's my-

who was on that island for five years.

- How do you know about that?
- Well, that's my job to know, Arden.

Now where is the little lady?

Uh, now,
what are these papers about?

I gotta say, Arden,
I take my hat off to you.

What's to see? Just an affidavit
for the missus to sign.

1047
01:06:47,734 --> 01:06:50,828
What kind of affidavit? She won't sign
anything unless I've seen it first.

But there's somebody waiting for you.

1164
01:17:44,524 --> 01:17:46,492
Nicky, darling.

1165
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,687
I've brought someone for you to meet.

1166
01:17:50,297 --> 01:17:52,527
This is Adam.

1167
01:17:54,467 --> 01:17:58,233
Well, well. So this is Mr. Burkett.

1168
01:17:58,305 --> 01:18:00,773
[Chuckles]
Pleased to meet ya, Nick.

1169
01:18:00,841 --> 01:18:04,004
Yeah, and I to meet you, Adam.

1170
01:18:04,077 --> 01:18:06,671
- Well, that- that's a little joke, you know.
- Yes, isn't it?

1171
01:18:06,746 --> 01:18:08,680
[All Chuckling]

1172
01:18:08,748 --> 01:18:11,410
Well, why don't we all sit down, huh?

1173
01:18:14,321 --> 01:18:16,255
Well, I, uh-
[Clears Throat]

1174
01:18:16,323 --> 01:18:18,450
L- I really haven't much time.

1175
01:18:18,525 --> 01:18:21,824
I, uh- I'm making a report
to the Geographic Society...

1176
01:18:21,895 --> 01:18:25,092
on the flora and fauna
we found on the island.

1177
01:18:25,165 --> 01:18:29,067
I was really very excited
about the island vegetation.

1178
01:18:30,403 --> 01:18:32,598
I'm afraid I spent
so much time on research...

1179
01:18:32,672 --> 01:18:35,163
I was not very good company
for your wife.

1180
01:18:35,242 --> 01:18:39,611
- Well, I'm sure she understood.
- Of course.

1181
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:43,513
Uh, Eve said you had some
questions to ask me, Nick.

1182
01:18:43,583 --> 01:18:46,882
Well, uh, let me see, uh-

1183
01:18:48,722 --> 01:18:50,656
What kind of an island was it?

1184
01:18:50,724 --> 01:18:52,692
Kind?

1185
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:57,523
Uh, uh, well, I'd say it was a-

1186
01:18:57,597 --> 01:18:59,531
an ordinary island.

1187
01:18:59,599 --> 01:19:02,067
- Wouldn't you say?
- Oh, y- Oh, yes.

1188
01:19:02,135 --> 01:19:04,729
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Small?

1189
01:19:04,804 --> 01:19:07,796
Well, not small. Not large.

1190
01:19:07,874 --> 01:19:11,037
- Medium.
- Medium. Medium.

1191
01:19:12,345 --> 01:19:14,813
Uh, jungle?

1192
01:19:14,881 --> 01:19:18,612
- Jungle?
- Well, y-you know, trees, vines.

1193
01:19:18,685 --> 01:19:20,915
Oh, trees!
[Chuckles]

1194
01:19:20,987 --> 01:19:23,012
Oh, golly, yeah, trees.

1195
01:19:24,557 --> 01:19:27,287
- Uh, no vines?
- Oh, uh-

1196
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:31,592
[Stammering]
V-Vines, yeah. Around the trees.

1197
01:19:31,665 --> 01:19:33,565
[Chuckles]

1198
01:19:33,633 --> 01:19:35,567
Uh, water?

1199
01:19:35,635 --> 01:19:38,798
Oh, yeah, water.
Uh, around the island.

1200
01:19:40,073 --> 01:19:42,041
Where'd you live?

1201
01:19:42,108 --> 01:19:44,576
The trees.
We lived- lived in trees.

1202
01:19:44,644 --> 01:19:46,874
- Oh.
- Separate trees.

1203
01:19:46,947 --> 01:19:50,246
Oh. Even during the rainy season?

1204
01:19:52,285 --> 01:19:56,551
- Oh, when it rained, we moved into caves.
- Oh.

1205
01:19:56,623 --> 01:19:58,818
Separate caves.

1206
01:19:58,892 --> 01:20:02,828
Well, uh, I guess Adam
had better be running along.

1207
01:20:02,896 --> 01:20:05,524
- Oh, must you?
- Well, I don't know. L-

1208
01:20:05,598 --> 01:20:09,466
Well, you know the Geographic Society
insists on punctuality, Adam.

1209
01:20:09,536 --> 01:20:12,027
And if Adam is anything, he's punctual.

1210
01:20:12,105 --> 01:20:15,404
A sterling quality.
Well, it's been nice meeting you, Adam.

1211
01:20:15,475 --> 01:20:18,876
- Hey, uh, we should get together sometime, huh?
- Yeah. That's a good idea.

1212
01:20:18,945 --> 01:20:20,936
Maybe we should make a night of it.

1213
01:20:21,014 --> 01:20:23,949
- Have some chow mein, go bowling or something.
- Yeah, sure.

1214
01:20:24,017 --> 01:20:26,645
- Thursday?
- Well, uh, Thursday-

1215
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,711
- Oh, it's good to see you again, Adam.
- Bye.

1216
01:20:28,788 --> 01:20:31,086
- Good-bye, Adam.
- Good-bye.

1217
01:20:31,157 --> 01:20:33,125
- Real nice chap.
- Thank you.

1218
01:20:35,028 --> 01:20:36,962
There now.

1219
01:20:38,898 --> 01:20:40,832
- Satisfied?
- Completely.

1220
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:43,460
Are you ashamed
of all those nasty suspicions?

1221
01:20:43,536 --> 01:20:46,471
- I blush at the thought.
- Oh, Nicky.

1222
01:20:46,539 --> 01:20:50,942
Imagine thinking
that sweet little man and I were-

1223
01:20:51,011 --> 01:20:54,777
Really!
[Laughs]

1224
01:20:54,848 --> 01:20:56,907
[Both Laughing]

1225
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:02,955
Oh, sweetheart. Look-

1226
01:21:03,023 --> 01:21:07,187
Now that you're here,
why don't we go for a drive...

1227
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:09,251
and maybe stop for
something to drink, huh?

1228
01:21:09,329 --> 01:21:11,889
Oh, I'd love it.
Um, will you let me drive?

1229
01:21:11,965 --> 01:21:13,899
- Oh, sure.
- I need the practice.

1230
01:21:13,967 --> 01:21:17,164
Mm-hmm. Shall we go together
or in separate cars, hmm?

1231
01:21:24,311 --> 01:21:26,245
[ Brakes Screech]

1232
01:21:26,313 --> 01:21:28,338
Whew. I didn't do too badly, did I?

1233
01:21:28,415 --> 01:21:30,610
Oh, no. Except when
you made that left-hand turn...

1234
01:21:30,684 --> 01:21:32,879
you signaled
with your windshield wipers.

1235
01:21:32,953 --> 01:21:35,649
It's all those buttons, Nicky.
They confuse me.

1236
01:21:35,722 --> 01:21:37,656
It's like learning all over again.

1237
01:21:37,724 --> 01:21:41,251
Well, that's civilization for you, Eve.
[Chuckles]

1238
01:21:41,328 --> 01:21:43,353
[Chattering]

1239
01:21:50,036 --> 01:21:52,095
- Two, please.
- Right this way, please.

1240
01:21:57,744 --> 01:22:00,178
Oh, uh, why don't you sit there?
I'll sit here.

1241
01:22:00,247 --> 01:22:02,647
- Oh. Why?
- Uh, keep the sun out of your eyes.

1242
01:22:02,716 --> 01:22:04,741
I don't mind the sun.

1243
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,883
Uh, what would you like, dear?

1244
01:22:09,956 --> 01:22:12,356
- Scotch? Martini?
- You know what I'd love?

1245
01:22:12,425 --> 01:22:14,859
Something I've been dreaming
about for five years-

1246
01:22:14,928 --> 01:22:17,419
a big, fat double-dipped
chocolate soda.

1247
01:22:19,299 --> 01:22:22,166
- And you, sir?
- Scotch, please.

1248
01:22:22,235 --> 01:22:24,533
- A big, fat double?
- On the rocks.

1249
01:22:28,908 --> 01:22:31,433
- You sure you wouldn't rather sit over here?
- I'm fine.

1250
01:22:31,511 --> 01:22:33,945
- Really, I love the sun.
- You're squinting.

1251
01:22:34,014 --> 01:22:36,574
- I'm smiling.
- [Chuckles]

1252
01:22:38,718 --> 01:22:40,709
On the back. Get it on the back.

1253
01:22:40,787 --> 01:22:43,517
A very attractive group of people here,
don't you think?

1254
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:46,718
Oh, Nicky. You're funny.

1255
01:22:46,793 --> 01:22:48,852
Me?

1256
01:22:48,928 --> 01:22:51,522
You're trying so hard
to make conversation with me.

1257
01:22:51,598 --> 01:22:56,126
- Oh, well-
- Of course, we have been apart a long time.

1258
01:22:56,202 --> 01:22:59,137
Oh, Nicky.
I know it hasn't been easy for you.

1259
01:22:59,205 --> 01:23:03,198
- I mean, with Jenny and Didi.
- Oh, well, they're great kids.

1260
01:23:03,276 --> 01:23:06,677
Oh, they are. They're marvelous.

1261
01:23:06,746 --> 01:23:10,113
And you've just done the most
wonderful job of raising them.

1262
01:23:10,183 --> 01:23:14,017
Oh, kids aren't hard to bring up.

1263
01:23:14,087 --> 01:23:16,817
You just pretend they're someone else's.

1264
01:23:16,890 --> 01:23:19,882
But they're not someone else's.
They're ours.

1265
01:23:22,028 --> 01:23:25,520
Oh, and I can't seem to find
a way to tell them who I am.

1266
01:23:27,567 --> 01:23:29,899
Well, we'll work it out.

1267
01:23:35,909 --> 01:23:37,843
Nick, there's-

1268
01:23:39,112 --> 01:23:42,081
there's something that I'd-
I'd like to tell you.

1269
01:23:42,148 --> 01:23:44,309
Well?

1270
01:23:44,384 --> 01:23:49,185
Oh, I'm such a dope. And I meant well,
Nick, but I'm such a dope.

1271
01:23:49,255 --> 01:23:52,349
About what?

1272
01:23:52,425 --> 01:23:55,656
That man that I brought to your office
was not Stephen Burkett.

1273
01:23:55,729 --> 01:23:59,631
- Really?
- No. He was a shoe clerk.

1274
01:23:59,699 --> 01:24:02,031
And I paid him to say those things.

1275
01:24:04,904 --> 01:24:08,340
Oh, Nick, I thought if you met
the real Stephen Burkett...

1276
01:24:08,408 --> 01:24:10,569
that you just- that you just might-

1277
01:24:10,643 --> 01:24:13,407
I might what?

1278
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:16,711
Well, I thought that you might think
what I thought you were thinking...

1279
01:24:16,783 --> 01:24:18,774
you know,
when you thought that- that-

1280
01:24:20,253 --> 01:24:22,187
Well, he is kind of attractive.

1281
01:24:22,255 --> 01:24:25,122
Burkett?

1282
01:24:25,191 --> 01:24:28,126
Oh, not to me. Not to me at all.

1283
01:24:28,194 --> 01:24:30,424
But- But some people
might think so.

1284
01:24:30,497 --> 01:24:33,057
And l- I was just so afraid-
so afraid that you might-

1285
01:24:33,133 --> 01:24:35,101
that you might be upset.

1286
01:24:35,168 --> 01:24:38,103
- [Chuckles, Mouths Words]
- [ Girl Yells]

1287
01:24:42,409 --> 01:24:44,775
[Laughing]

1288
01:24:44,844 --> 01:24:47,438
E-Ellen, let's get out of here.

1289
01:24:47,514 --> 01:24:49,209
- Oh, Nick, you are upset.
- I'm not.

1290
01:24:49,282 --> 01:24:50,874
- Please don't be.
- I'm not.

1291
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:53,214
- You hate me. I know you do.
- I don't.

1292
01:24:53,286 --> 01:24:55,652
It's just I know where
they serve a better soda.

1293
01:24:55,722 --> 01:24:58,782
- Where?
- Oh, Ellen, come on.

1294
01:25:00,994 --> 01:25:03,258
Sir.! Sir.!

1295
01:25:03,329 --> 01:25:06,821
- Your doubles.
- You go ahead, Ellen. I'll catch up.

1296
01:25:07,834 --> 01:25:10,268
Here.

1297
01:25:10,336 --> 01:25:12,463
[ Stephen]
Eve.!

1298
01:25:14,908 --> 01:25:16,808
Eve.

1299
01:25:17,977 --> 01:25:20,912
Baby! What are you doing here?

1300
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:23,244
Me? What are you doing here?

1301
01:25:23,316 --> 01:25:25,807
Oh, just trying to unwind a little.

1302
01:25:28,455 --> 01:25:30,389
So that's why you brought me here!

1303
01:25:30,457 --> 01:25:32,391
Oh, Ellen,
it only appears that way-

1304
01:25:32,459 --> 01:25:35,292
- What a miserable, dirty rotten trick!
- Oh, honey, this can't be Nicky.

1305
01:25:35,361 --> 01:25:38,023
- Why can't it be?
- You just wanted to humiliate me, that's all.

1306
01:25:38,097 --> 01:25:40,725
- I'm Steve Burkett, old buddy.
- He knows perfectly well who you are.

1307
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,325
- And he's a suspicious, narrow-minded, jealous-
- Let's go, honey.

1308
01:25:43,403 --> 01:25:45,735
- I'll explain in the car. You see-
- Explain what?

1309
01:25:45,805 --> 01:25:49,366
- How you deliberately made
a fool of me all afternoon?
- Ellen!

1310
01:25:53,379 --> 01:25:56,644
Man, she sure looks great in clothes.

1311
01:25:56,716 --> 01:25:59,207
I've got a few questions
for you, old buddy.

1312
01:25:59,285 --> 01:26:03,016
Uh-uh. I just sold exclusive rights
to my story to Life magazine...

1313
01:26:03,089 --> 01:26:05,057
old buddy.

1314
01:26:11,297 --> 01:26:13,925
Ellen. Ellen, wait! Ellen!

1315
01:26:16,436 --> 01:26:18,961
Hey, cab. Follow that car!

[Horn Honks]

1317
01:26:54,641 --> 01:26:57,906
Oh, women! I'll never figure
them out if I live to be-

1318
01:26:57,977 --> 01:26:59,911
if I live!

1319
01:26:59,979 --> 01:27:02,914
- Talk up, mister. Don't mumble.
- Just keep your eye on the road.

1320
01:27:02,982 --> 01:27:05,007
- And catch that car, that's all.
- Catch that car.

1321
01:27:24,504 --> 01:27:26,768
Catch that nut before she kills herself.

1322
01:27:26,839 --> 01:27:29,501
- We could all go, mister.
- I'll double anything on the meter.

1323
01:27:29,576 --> 01:27:31,510
I can't spend it up there.

1324

[Honks]

1325
01:28:26,699 --> 01:28:29,532
Oh. Oh, no. Shut the door.

1326
01:28:45,718 --> 01:28:48,380
[Screaming]

1327
01:28:50,823 --> 01:28:52,757
Get me out of here!

1328
01:28:54,293 --> 01:28:56,124
Oh!

1329
01:29:14,814 --> 01:29:17,476
Oh, my hair!

1330
01:29:27,393 --> 01:29:29,987
[Screams]
Oh, help!

1331
01:29:36,069 --> 01:29:37,832
[Screams]
Oh, help!

1332
01:29:53,086 --> 01:29:54,678
Ellen!

1333
01:30:12,605 --> 01:30:15,472
I can't help myself, Dr. Schlick.

1334
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:18,237
That's how I feel about my marriage.

1335
01:30:18,311 --> 01:30:22,247
Very well. I will have
a little chat with your Nicholas.

1336
01:30:22,315 --> 01:30:27,582
- If he arrives ever.
- Oh, you are such a comfort, Doctor.

1337
01:30:27,653 --> 01:30:29,985
You know, I truly believe...

1338
01:30:30,056 --> 01:30:32,854
the most vital relationship
a woman can establish...

1339
01:30:32,925 --> 01:30:36,554
is not between man and wife.

1340
01:30:36,629 --> 01:30:40,827
It's the relationship between
a woman and her analyst.

1341
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:43,994
Don't you agree, Dr. Schlick?

1342
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:46,504
Call me Herman.

1343
01:31:02,155 --> 01:31:04,123
Will you wait a minute, please?

1344
01:31:06,826 --> 01:31:08,953
[Doorbell Rings]

1345
01:31:13,866 --> 01:31:15,857
- Ellen. Wait!
- [Banging]

1346
01:31:18,838 --> 01:31:20,772
Ellen, wait.

1347
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:24,173
- We can settle this thing right here and now.
- Ooh!

1348
01:31:24,243 --> 01:31:27,872
Ow! Oh, Ellen, stop-
Ellen, come here. Listen to me.

1349
01:31:27,947 --> 01:31:30,745
- I said let go of me!
- Nicholas!

1350
01:31:30,817 --> 01:31:34,014
- See what I mean, Herman?
- You didn't say he was violent.

1351
01:31:34,086 --> 01:31:36,646
- Nicholas.
- What on earth is all this yelling about?

1352
01:31:36,722 --> 01:31:38,656
Nicholas, let that woman go!

1353
01:31:38,724 --> 01:31:41,158
- Not until she answers my question!
- I won't answer anything.

1354
01:31:41,227 --> 01:31:44,663
- You big bully!
- I want to know what happened on that island.

1355
01:31:44,730 --> 01:31:48,222
You don't have to know anything. You should learn
to trust your wife, with no questions asked!

1356
01:31:48,301 --> 01:31:51,896
- He doesn't trust you?
- Not her. Her. She's my wife!

1357
01:31:51,971 --> 01:31:53,939
- Oh.
- There! I said it. Are you satisfied?

1358
01:31:54,006 --> 01:31:56,668
- You're my wife!
- I was your wife!

1359
01:31:56,742 --> 01:32:00,769
- Oh, you poor dear boy.
- Oh, Mom, will you tell her Ellen's my wife?

1360
01:32:00,847 --> 01:32:04,146
- Who is this Ellen?
- She's my wife, stupid!

1361
01:32:04,217 --> 01:32:06,151
His first wife. She's dead!

1362
01:32:06,219 --> 01:32:09,245
- And that woman-
- That's the nurse I told you about.

1363
01:32:09,322 --> 01:32:11,790
A nurse from the Busy Bee Car Wash?

1364
01:32:11,858 --> 01:32:14,326
She is not a nurse!
These are her clothes.

1365
01:32:14,393 --> 01:32:18,727
- She is Ellen Wagstaff Arden, my wife, stupid!
- [ Doorbell Rings]

1366
01:32:19,999 --> 01:32:21,967
- Yes?
- You Nicholas Arden?

1367
01:32:22,034 --> 01:32:24,730
- Yes. What do you want?
- We have a warrant for your arrest.

1368
01:32:24,804 --> 01:32:27,170
Arrest? What for?

1369
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,504
- Bigamy.
- Bigamy?

1370
01:32:29,575 --> 01:32:31,509
There, now do you believe me?

1371
01:32:31,577 --> 01:32:34,307
But he's not a bigamist.
Who made such a ridiculous charge?

1372
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:37,076
- Yeah.
- A Mrs. Grace Arden.

1373
01:32:37,149 --> 01:32:39,845
- My... mother?
- That's right.

1374
01:32:39,919 --> 01:32:44,549
If you can't settle this mess,
maybe the courts can.

1375
01:32:45,892 --> 01:32:49,020
Quiet. Quiet!
Can't we have a little order in here?

1376
01:32:49,095 --> 01:32:51,290
Order. Order in the court.

1377
01:32:51,364 --> 01:32:54,561
I don't know why this has to be
the loudest court in the state.

1378
01:32:54,634 --> 01:32:57,102
Well, where's the district attorney?
Isn't this his case?

1379
01:32:57,169 --> 01:32:59,160
Yes, Your Honor.

1380
01:32:59,238 --> 01:33:02,435
I know he's the district attorney.
I know that.

1381
01:33:02,508 --> 01:33:05,238
Now, uh, what is all this?

1382
01:33:05,311 --> 01:33:09,111
Your Honor, in an effort to expedite matters
in this somewhat unusual hearing...

1383
01:33:09,181 --> 01:33:12,742
we pray decisions on a number
of legal actions filed concurrently...

1384
01:33:12,818 --> 01:33:15,651
all of which are components
of one basic familial disturbance.

1385
01:33:15,721 --> 01:33:19,521
Sounds like something the court of appeals
is going to reverse me on already.

1386
01:33:19,592 --> 01:33:22,857
If the bailiff will call the principals...

1387
01:33:22,929 --> 01:33:25,523
I will try to provide the court
with the various issues involved.

1388
01:33:25,598 --> 01:33:27,463
Nicholas Arden.

1389
01:33:27,533 --> 01:33:30,934
[ District Attorney] Mr. Nicholas Arden,
a respected member of the local bar...

1390
01:33:31,003 --> 01:33:33,062
is charged primarily with bigamy...

1391
01:33:33,139 --> 01:33:36,597
but is also a party
to one or two other actions.

1392
01:33:36,676 --> 01:33:39,372
- Haven't I seen you here before?
- Well, yes, sir.

1393
01:33:39,445 --> 01:33:41,379
- [Bailiff] Mrs. Grace Arden.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1394
01:33:41,447 --> 01:33:44,712
It is Mrs. Grace Arden who brought
the charge of bigamy against Mr. Arden.

1395
01:33:44,784 --> 01:33:46,979
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself, ma'am-

1396
01:33:47,053 --> 01:33:49,146
a woman your age marrying this man.

1397
01:33:49,221 --> 01:33:52,713
Marrying him?
I happen to be his mother.

1398
01:33:52,792 --> 01:33:55,989
You mean, your own mother
charged you with bigamy?

1399
01:33:56,062 --> 01:33:59,225
I certainly did!

1400
01:33:59,298 --> 01:34:01,698
I hope you remember this
on Mother's Day.

1401
01:34:01,767 --> 01:34:04,065
[ Bailiff]
Mrs. Bianca Steele Arden.

1402
01:34:04,136 --> 01:34:08,004
Mrs. Bianca Steele Arden
is one of the wives of the defendant...

1403
01:34:08,074 --> 01:34:10,406
and is asking for an annulment
of that marriage.

1404
01:34:10,476 --> 01:34:13,274
- You look familiar, young lady.
- I hope so, Your Honor.

1405
01:34:13,346 --> 01:34:16,543
- You married me.
- No, I married a little, short, fat-

1406
01:34:16,615 --> 01:34:18,810
- Oh, you-you mean to him.
- [Bracelet Jangles]

1407
01:34:18,884 --> 01:34:20,852
Oh, yes. I remember you now.

1408
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:23,354
You're that do-it-yourself
head-shrinker.

1409
01:34:23,422 --> 01:34:26,914
Please, Your Honor.! Please.!
May I object to that remark?

1410
01:34:26,993 --> 01:34:30,861
- Who are you?
- I happen to be Dr. Herman Schlick.

1411
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:34,559
He's my analyst and my dearest friend.

1412
01:34:34,633 --> 01:34:37,568
And he's here to testify to my
emotional need for an annulment.

1413
01:34:37,636 --> 01:34:41,037
Yes, this man is completely unstable,
with definite schizoid tendencies-

1414
01:34:41,107 --> 01:34:44,599
Quiet. Nobody asked you
to testify, Doctor.

1415
01:34:44,677 --> 01:34:46,975
Just take your seat.

1416
01:34:47,046 --> 01:34:50,812
- Can he do that?
- It's all right, dear. Really!

1417
01:34:50,883 --> 01:34:54,478
- Did you say she wanted an annulment?
- I most certainly do.

1418
01:34:54,553 --> 01:34:59,525
Now even my marriages
are being reversed on me.

1419
01:34:59,658 --> 01:35:01,626
- What was wrong with it?
- [Whispering] Well, as usual in such cases-

1420
01:35:01,693 --> 01:35:04,093
- Un-kissed, you mean?
- Un-anything.

1421
01:35:04,162 --> 01:35:06,995
[Chuckles]
Harvard man.

1422
01:35:08,367 --> 01:35:11,200
[ Bailiff]
Mrs. Ellen Wagstaff Arden.

1423
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:14,535
[ District Attorney] Mrs. Ellen Wagstaff Arden,
who on the motion of Mr. Arden...

1424
01:35:14,606 --> 01:35:18,201
was declared legally dead, now petitions
the court to reverse that order.

1425
01:35:18,277 --> 01:35:22,680
Now, what bumbling idiot ever declared this
perfectly healthy-looking young woman dead?

1426
01:35:22,748 --> 01:35:24,716
- Well, you did, Your Honor.
- Oh.

1427
01:35:24,783 --> 01:35:26,751
Uh, strike my last remark
from the record.

1428
01:35:26,818 --> 01:35:29,548
When Mrs. Arden is declared
legally alive again...

1429
01:35:29,621 --> 01:35:32,488
she asks a divorce from Mr. Arden.

1430
01:35:32,558 --> 01:35:35,220
Well, if that's on my account,
you can save yourself the trouble.

1431
01:35:35,294 --> 01:35:38,320
It's no trouble. He's all yours.

1432
01:35:38,397 --> 01:35:42,163
I couldn't possibly
be less interested in the man.

1433
01:35:42,234 --> 01:35:44,702
Well, you seem to be back
in public domain, counselor.

1434
01:35:44,770 --> 01:35:48,365
In the event Mrs. Bianca Steele Arden's
petition for annulment is denied...

1435
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:50,635
she also asks a divorce from Mr. Arden.

1436
01:35:50,709 --> 01:35:52,700
- On what grounds?
- Mental cruelty.

1437
01:35:52,778 --> 01:35:55,941
- Extreme mental cruelty.
- Oh, nonsense-

1438
01:35:56,014 --> 01:35:58,005
- Quiet.
- At the same time, Your Honor...

1439
01:35:58,083 --> 01:36:00,517
Mr. Arden is bringing countersuits
for divorce against...

1440
01:36:00,586 --> 01:36:03,384
Mrs. Bianca Steele Arden
and Mrs. Ellen Wagstaff Arden.

1441
01:36:03,455 --> 01:36:06,083
Against me?

1442
01:36:06,158 --> 01:36:08,649
[Huffs]
How could you?

1443
01:36:08,727 --> 01:36:11,218
- You're doing it to me.
- That's entirely different.

1444
01:36:11,296 --> 01:36:14,788
- [ Gavel Bangs]
- Your Honor, against Mrs. Ellen Wagstaff Arden...

1445
01:36:14,866 --> 01:36:19,360
Mr. Arden names as correspondent,
Mr. Stephen Burkett.

1446
01:36:19,438 --> 01:36:23,568
Oh, Nicholas Arden, don't you ever
speak to me again as long as you live!

1447
01:36:23,642 --> 01:36:26,406
Come back here, young woman.
Where do you think you're going?

1448
01:36:26,478 --> 01:36:29,811
I will not stay here
and be humiliated by this- this-

1449
01:36:29,881 --> 01:36:32,873
You are going to stay here.
And don't argue with me.

1450
01:36:32,951 --> 01:36:34,680
I'll fine you $25 for contempt.

1451
01:36:37,923 --> 01:36:40,221
How can you fine a corpse?
I'm still legally dead.

1452
01:36:40,292 --> 01:36:42,260
Then I'll declare you legally alive.

1453
01:36:42,327 --> 01:36:45,421
If you do that before the annulment,
Your Honor, I'll be guilty of bigamy.

1454
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:50,694
I should've played golf today,
arthritis and all.

1455
01:36:50,769 --> 01:36:53,033
I'm also asking
for a restraining order...

1456
01:36:53,105 --> 01:36:56,802
against the publication of Mr. Burkett's
story in a national magazine...

1457
01:36:56,875 --> 01:36:59,867
on the grounds that it may
hold me up to public ridicule.

1458
01:36:59,945 --> 01:37:02,470
Oh, really? What is the story?

1459
01:37:02,547 --> 01:37:05,072
- Well, I don't know it, Your Honor.
- You don't know it?

1460
01:37:05,150 --> 01:37:08,119
Well, no, sir. That's why I asked
for a subpoena for Mr. Burkett...

1461
01:37:08,186 --> 01:37:10,120
so he can tell his story in court.

1462
01:37:10,188 --> 01:37:12,281
- [Bailiff] Stephen Burkett!
- That isn't necessary!

1463
01:37:13,859 --> 01:37:16,419
Would you like to change places
with me, madam?

1464
01:37:16,495 --> 01:37:18,929
Your Honor, do we have to discuss it here?
It isn't "revelant."

1465
01:37:18,997 --> 01:37:20,965
- Relevant.
- R-Relevant.

1466
01:37:21,033 --> 01:37:23,433
It so happens I consider it
entirely "revelant"...

1467
01:37:23,502 --> 01:37:26,130
and I consider you
entirely out of order.

1468
01:37:26,204 --> 01:37:29,731
- Now don't tax my patience.
- Good morning, Your Honor.

1469
01:37:29,808 --> 01:37:32,242
What's your story, Tarzan?

1470
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:35,302
Well, sir, Ellen and I were both
survivors of that plane crash.

1471
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:37,940
- Now, I'm a very strong swimmer-
- Never mind about your strength.

1472
01:37:38,016 --> 01:37:40,780
- Just get to the point.
- I'll do the questioning here, counselor.

1473
01:37:40,852 --> 01:37:43,150
Go on. After the crash,
what happened?

1474
01:37:43,221 --> 01:37:45,815
- Well, sir, when-
- Nothing happened.

1475
01:37:45,891 --> 01:37:49,224
- Twenty-five dollars.
- Can he do that?

1476
01:37:49,294 --> 01:37:51,285
He can do whatever he wants.
He's the judge.

1477
01:37:51,363 --> 01:37:53,422
That's right. Well?

1478
01:37:53,498 --> 01:37:56,524
Well, sir, I fished Ellen out of the water,
got her to that island...

1479
01:37:56,601 --> 01:37:58,933
where we stayed
until we were, uh, rescued.

1480
01:37:59,004 --> 01:38:01,973
- Oh? How long was that?
- Five years.

1481
01:38:03,442 --> 01:38:06,172
You two were on that island
together for five years?

1482
01:38:06,244 --> 01:38:08,576
And three days.

1483
01:38:08,647 --> 01:38:12,413
- Were they alone?
- Oh, just the two of us,
Your Honor-Adam and Eve.

1484
01:38:12,484 --> 01:38:15,476
- Is that in the brief?
- It is not.

1485
01:38:16,555 --> 01:38:18,489
Oh, that should be in the brief.

1486
01:38:18,557 --> 01:38:20,991
- That's the most interesting part of the case.
- [ Bianca] Your Honor.

1487
01:38:21,059 --> 01:38:24,688
May I please have your permission
to get out of here before I explode?

1488
01:38:24,763 --> 01:38:27,095
I'd like to go home myself.

1489
01:38:27,165 --> 01:38:29,156
I'd like to tell my wife about this.

1490
01:38:29,234 --> 01:38:31,361
She thinks all my cases are dull.

1491
01:38:31,436 --> 01:38:33,370
This one's a doozy.

1492
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:40,136
Now then, counselor,
we'll take first things first.

1493
01:38:40,212 --> 01:38:42,680
Uh, what is the first thing?

1494
01:38:42,748 --> 01:38:45,046
The charge of bigamy, Your Honor.

1495
01:38:45,117 --> 01:38:47,142
I have a precedent to cite.
The case of-

1496
01:38:47,219 --> 01:38:50,780
Never mind. I'm not interested in precedents.
My decisions are obvious.

1497
01:38:50,856 --> 01:38:53,256
When you married
the second Mrs. Arden...

1498
01:38:53,325 --> 01:38:56,158
the first Mrs. Arden
had been declared legally dead.

1499
01:38:56,228 --> 01:38:59,720
So I hereby dismiss the charge of bigamy.

1500
01:38:59,798 --> 01:39:04,064
Now, as for the second matter,
the "kissless" bride-

1501
01:39:04,136 --> 01:39:06,502
I hereby annul that marriage.

1502
01:39:06,571 --> 01:39:08,562
Thank you, Your Honor.
Now may I leave?

1503
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:12,098
As far as I'm concerned, you may all leave.
And the sooner the better.

1504
01:39:12,177 --> 01:39:14,145
But, Judge, I'm still legally dead!

1505
01:39:14,212 --> 01:39:18,876
Oh, yes. I hereby declare
Ellen Wagstaff Arden legally alive.

1506
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:20,884
Does that mean
she's married to him again?

1507
01:39:20,952 --> 01:39:22,886
You're darn right she's
married to me again- Still!

1508
01:39:22,954 --> 01:39:25,855
- I didn't ask you. I asked the judge.
- Leave me out of this.

1509
01:39:25,924 --> 01:39:29,052
- Case dismissed.
- Now wait, Your Honor. You can't do that.

1510
01:39:29,127 --> 01:39:32,153
- He can do whatever he wants. He's the judge.
- That's right.

1511
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:34,858
- But you haven't heard the whole story.
- I don't have to hear it.

1512
01:39:34,933 --> 01:39:37,561
I'll take your petition for divorce
under advisement and let you know later.

1513
01:39:37,636 --> 01:39:40,605
How much later? I'd like to know
when Ellen's free to marry me.

1514
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:43,664
- [Huffs]
- You hear that? Something
did happen on that island!

1515
01:39:43,742 --> 01:39:45,937
- Nothing happened!
- Ellen, tell them what-

1516
01:39:46,011 --> 01:39:48,411
- You keep quiet!
- [Judge Bangs Gavel] Here.! Here.!

1517
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:51,244
[ Ellen] And you stop banging
that silly little hammer.!

1518
01:39:51,316 --> 01:39:53,375
What are you beefing about,
anyway, old buddy?

1519
01:39:53,451 --> 01:39:56,978
You and Ellen were married for only three years,
while she and I were together for five.

1520
01:39:57,055 --> 01:39:59,751
- So I'm claiming her on the basis of seniority.
- Ooh!

1521
01:39:59,825 --> 01:40:01,850
Well, you can have her.

1522
01:40:01,927 --> 01:40:03,861
- [Screams] Nicky!
- Baby.

1523
01:40:03,929 --> 01:40:05,863
See what you've done!

1524
01:40:05,931 --> 01:40:09,128
Look, let's you and me cut out
to my hotel and talk it over, huh?

1525
01:40:09,201 --> 01:40:13,194
For five years you've been a big fat pain
in the neck, chasing me around that island...

1526
01:40:13,271 --> 01:40:16,604
and I told you I never wanna look
at that wolfish face of yours again!

1527
01:40:16,675 --> 01:40:19,576
You're a smug, egotistical,
strutting peacock!

1528
01:40:19,644 --> 01:40:21,771
Well, then, uh, how about lunch?

1529
01:40:21,847 --> 01:40:23,781
[Screams]

1530
01:40:33,458 --> 01:40:37,792
For five years you went through
this kind of treatment?

1531
01:40:37,863 --> 01:40:39,990
[Clicks Tongue]
My goodness.

1532
01:41:02,988 --> 01:41:05,081
- Where have you been?
- Where's Nicky?

1533
01:41:05,156 --> 01:41:07,147
I expected you back hours ago.

1534
01:41:07,225 --> 01:41:10,592
- Didn't he come home with you?
- After the way he stormed out of that courtroom?

1535
01:41:10,662 --> 01:41:12,653
I took a cab.

1536
01:41:14,266 --> 01:41:16,860
I've just made such a mess of everything.

1537
01:41:18,136 --> 01:41:20,070
And what about the children?

1538
01:41:20,138 --> 01:41:22,629
Well, they had to live without a mother
for a long time.

1539
01:41:22,707 --> 01:41:25,039
I suppose they can do without
a father around the house.

1540
01:41:27,145 --> 01:41:30,308
Oh, Grace. How will I ever
explain to them?

1541
01:41:30,382 --> 01:41:35,217
You just march yourself out there
and tell your children who you are.

1542
01:41:35,287 --> 01:41:37,653
Go on.

1543
01:42:10,956 --> 01:42:13,254
[Jenny]
Hi, Mom.

1544
01:42:19,998 --> 01:42:22,364
Hi, Mommy.
[Laughs]

1545
01:42:32,410 --> 01:42:36,904
Well, isn't it about time somebody
started kissing somebody around here?

1546
01:42:38,717 --> 01:42:40,708
Oh, Nicky!

1547
01:42:49,661 --> 01:42:52,152
- Hey!
- It's my turn.

1548
01:43:20,661 --> 01:43:21,152
