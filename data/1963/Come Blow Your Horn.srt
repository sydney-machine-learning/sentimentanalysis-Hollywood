1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:03,237
[up-tempo music]

2
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:08,662
[up-tempo music continues]

3
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:37,491
- [stair squeaks]
 - [woman] Buddy? Is that you?

4
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,428
- Yeah, Mom.
 - You're home from work early.

5
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:42,930
Yeah, um, I'm going out tonight.

6
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,700
[mother] Please, darling, don't
track dirt in the living room.

7
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,935
[Buddy] I won't.

8
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:51,965
- [mother] Buddy?
 - Mom, I'm in a hurry.

9
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:56,404
All right, only maybe someday
 you'll tell me what I did
 to deserve it.

10
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:57,705
[Buddy] Deserve what, Mom?

11
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,640
A son who's gone all day
and comes home

12
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,443
and doesn't even ask
 his mother how she's feeling.

13
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,378
How do you feel, Mom?

14
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,914
Don't ask.

15
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,896
Gee, Mom, I'm sorry
you don't feel well.

16
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,065
I would've come to you, darling,
but I can't leave the stove.

17
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:28,235
- Sure.
 - You know your father
 likes stuffed peppers.

18
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:32,072
So I'm trapped here all day
 like an animal.

19
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:34,007
It's only 5:00.
Where are you going?

20
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,609
I told you, Mom.
I'm going out.

21
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,746
- Without dinner?
- Oh, Mom, don't worry.

22
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:41,081
- I'll eat, honest.
 - Where? What?

23
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,416
Better have something now.

24
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,884
Oh, no, Mom, listen.
I'm not hungry now.

25
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,354
Here's some potato pancakes.
I just warmed them up.

26
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:49,823
- Oh, no, Mom,
I can't eat now.
- Eat.

27
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:53,527
Over the sink,
 I just waxed the floor.

28
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,796
Now, let me see,
what else can I get you?

29
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:59,767
- The pancakes are enough, Mom.
- There's some nice, cold lamb.
Would you like some cold lamb?

30
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:02,903
- Mm-mm. Nothing else...
- Over the sink
with the pancakes.

31
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:06,574
And if you're going
 to eat like a slob,
 don't do me any favors.

32
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:08,542
Mom, I didn't want
to eat anyway!

33
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,578
Sure, that's why
 you're eating them.

34
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:12,580
Now I don't have enough
 for your father.

35
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,116
But, Mom, you gave 'em to me!

36
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:18,285
Oh, what's the use?

37
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:20,053
I'll see you later.
I gotta go.

38
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,256
- All right.
 You'll be back early?
 - Yeah, sure.

39
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:28,696
Some backache. Khrushchev
 should have such a backache.

40
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,054
[mother] Harry, is that you?

41
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,190
No, it's a burglar...

42
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,761
...coming through
 the front door at 5:00...

43
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,464
...for dinner!

44
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,634
[mother] I see
 you're in a good mood.

45
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,937
Don't start with me.

46
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,142
[mother] You must've had some
day, coming home in such a mood.

47
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:18,512
The newspapers, you put them on
the dining room table again.

48
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,715
They're clean.
 I had them boiled.

49
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,952
That's all I need
 is scratches.

50
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,131
You'll spoil your appetite.

51
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:49,276
All right, Harry, something's
 eating you up alive.

52
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:51,078
What is it,
 what could it be?

53
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:55,849
Well, what is it,
what could it be? Your son!

54
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,485
Sh!

55
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,520
Harry, the neighbors.

56
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,689
So, it's Alan again?

57
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:04,992
Hasn't been to the office
 for three days. Three days!

58
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,860
And who's waiting
 for him all that time?

59
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,230
Only Eckman from Dallas,
one of our biggest accounts!

60
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,432
For three days
 I'm making up stories

61
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,635
while that, that bum...
Who knows where he is!

62
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:16,436
- Your son.
 - My son.

63
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,138
When it's Alan,
 it's my son.

64
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,673
When it's Buddy,
it's yours.

65
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,675
Buddy's different, he's got a
 head on his shoulders.

66
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,012
You'll spoil your appetite!

67
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,215
Come, I made
stuffed peppers special.

68
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,018
[Harry] I want something first.

69
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,153
Where is Buddy?
 He left the plant early today.

70
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:37,224
He had an early date.
Stop picking and close the door.

71
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:38,826
You'll let the cold out.

72
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,595
What's the difference?
There's no food in there anyway!

73
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:45,599
This isn't a refrigerator,
 it's an aluminum mine!

74
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,901
So it's an aluminum mine!

75
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:53,574
- Where was Buddy going tonight?
- He didn't say.

76
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:56,309
I'll feel better when he meets
a nice girl, gets married...

77
00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:00,681
Don't push so hard.
Sometimes I think that's
why Alan never married.

78
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:02,115
Alan I didn't
push hard enough.

79
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,752
And you, you were
 too soft all together.

80
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:06,787
Sure, my fault,
 blame it on me.

81
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,922
My fault Alan lives
 the way he does.

82
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,625
- Please, Sophie...
- My fault he won't settle down.

83
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:14,695
It's nobody's fault!

84
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:20,834
Three days he don't come
 to the office. I don't know
 what to do anymore.

85
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,836
Harry...

86
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,007
...eat.

87
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:32,445
Eat. Some solution.

88
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:35,883
They're looking for you
at the United Nations.

89
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:05,012
Four hours and
 ten minutes exactly.

90
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:07,014
Not bad for
 one-hand driving, huh?

91
00:09:07,114 --> 00:09:09,249
Next time,
we'll try with no hands.

92
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:12,085
- Next time.
 - [purrs]

93
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:15,122
- I'll race you to the elevator.
- All right.

94
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,226
I win!

95
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,261
So you did.

96
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,931
Now let's go right to my place
 where I keep the prizes.

97
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:27,267
- No, Alan.
 - But you said you were cold.

98
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,036
Well, I am.

99
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:32,339
Come on, I'll have your blood
 going up and down in no time.

100
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:39,647
Wanna stop in the lobby
for messages?

101
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,686
You didn't press my floor.

102
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,855
I'd rather press you.

103
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,824
- But, Alan,
it's been a long drive.
- No, no.

104
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:56,129
Let's not part yet.
Let's have a little drink
to cap off the perfect weekend.

105
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,440
We're here.

106
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,910
- But Alan...
 - Oh, come on.

107
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,180
- Alan...
 - Look, ever since I was a kid

108
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,884
I've had a thing about going
 into a dark apartment alone.

109
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:20,453
- Really, Alan?
- Would I lie to you
about a thing like that?

110
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,355
Yes.

111
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,391
You're right. Come on.

112
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,412
Ooh.

113
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:50,984
This apartment... Every time I
come up here, it just sends me.

114
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,021
Actually, it's a mere hovel.

115
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:57,290
But it's rather like me,
it responds to beautiful women.

116
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,961
Don't you ever get tired
of looking sensational?

117
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,930
- Think I do?
 - You kidding?

118
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,232
See those guys
on that ski jump?

119
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,801
They were watching you and
jumping in the parking lot.

120
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,402
[both laughing]

121
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,175
Ooh, you were right.

122
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,310
My blood is running
 up and down.

123
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,081
Mm. Now I'll get that drink
I was telling you about.

124
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,415
- Alan?
- Mm-hm?

125
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,751
Thank you for the weekend.

126
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,352
I had a wonderful time.

127
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,420
Yeah, it was fun.

128
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,857
Even though he didn't show up.

129
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:32,826
Even though... he, do...
what show up?

130
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:34,895
Your friend from Paramount.

131
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,530
Oh, Macintosh! Yes,
of course, that's show biz.

132
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,901
Did it say when expects to
 return to New York again?

133
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,937
- Did what say?
 - The telegram from Hollywood.

134
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:48,441
Oh, didn't I tell you? Yes, of
course, he's, uh, he's coming
next week. Next week.

135
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,846
Uh, early part. Monday or
Tuesday or something like that.

136
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,450
It's kind of funny now that you
think of it, isn't it?

137
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,521
- What's funny?
 - Well, him wanting
 to meet me in a hotel.

138
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:05,158
- It wasn't a hotel,
 it was a ski lodge.
 - Was it?

139
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,127
- Yes.
 - Anyway, it was nice.

140
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,163
I've never been to
 New Hampshire before.

141
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,765
It was Vermont.

142
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:16,069
Oh, I'm just terrible
 with names.

143
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,372
I can't imagine why such
an important producer

144
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:23,376
would want to travel all the way
up there just to meet me.

145
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:28,849
Yeah, well, uh... You see, like
I was trying to explain to you,

146
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,551
he's doing a picture about
 a winter carnival.

147
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:35,588
And he wanted to meet you up
there to see how you'd
photograph against the snow.

148
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,925
Now that makes sense,
 doesn't it?

149
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:39,392
Well, doesn't it?

150
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,594
Oh, sure.

151
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,763
Sure.

152
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:50,303
We gotta go again sometime
 when it's not for business.

153
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,172
- Just for fun.
- Crazy.

154
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,374
That'll be a swinging weekend.

155
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,776
Let's drink to that.

156
00:12:56,877 --> 00:13:00,647
Maybe next time,
 I could learn to ski!

157
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,615
It wouldn't surprise me at all.

158
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,953
It's a shame we were
 cooped up inside so long.

159
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:09,489
Yeah, well, like I explained
 to you, we got a bad break
 in the weather.

160
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:15,062
- You mean all that snow.
 - All that snow,
 it was very bad.

161
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,830
But you know something?

162
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,168
You made the cutest
 Saint Bernard I ever saw.

163
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,736
- [both laugh]
 - [slow jazz record plays]

164
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,873
[telephone rings]

165
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,908
- Alan?
- Mm-hm.

166
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,576
That's the lobby.

167
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,311
Mm-hm.

168
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:34,047
Well, you'd better answer it.
 It might be important.

169
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,548
Ohh...

170
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,117
- Alan...
 - Mm...

171
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:40,187
Alan, it might be important.

172
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,490
Lobby, schmobby.

173
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,526
Yeah, hello?

174
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,929
Yeah, about ten minutes ago.

175
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,531
Who? Well, put him on.

176
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,334
Hi, Buddy. What do you say, pal?

177
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,170
You wanna come up now?

178
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,172
Yeah, well, OK.
 I guess all right.

179
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,740
You know where the apartment is.
Come on up.

180
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,375
My kid brother.

181
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,545
I'd better go.
 I'll slip out the back way.

182
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,515
What are you rushing so?
We're on the 20th floor.

183
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:10,550
It takes a minute and
56 seconds to get up here.

184
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,320
Well, that's all right.
I wanted to go downstairs
and freshen up anyway.

185
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,588
I'd like to get
 a little fresh myself.

186
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:20,160
Oh, do you think he'll
 be here very long?

187
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,662
Not when you ask me like that
 he won't be here long.

188
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,098
Well, why don't you come down
 in about 20 minutes?

189
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,134
Why don't you come up in 19?

190
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,835
OK.

191
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:31,271
- Bye.
 - Bye.

192
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,115
[Alan] Come on in, it's open.

193
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,985
Hello, Alan.
 You busy?

194
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,254
No, no, no. I'm up in
the bedroom. Come on up.

195
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,097
- Are you coming up
 or aren't you, Buddy?
 - Yeah, I'm coming.

196
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,532
I'm just taking a look around.

197
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,670
Boy, this apartment's always
more exciting than I remembered.

198
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,872
- Hi, kid.
 - Hi, Alan.

199
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:07,374
I just got back from a trip.

200
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:09,109
Mind if I freshen up
while we visit?

201
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,544
This isn't a visit.

202
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,581
It isn't a...

203
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:21,321
- What you got in there?
- Pajamas, toothbrush.
The works.

204
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,556
You're kidding.

205
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,426
- Nope.
 - You left.

206
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:28,996
Permanently?

207
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,797
I packed eight pairs of socks.

208
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,432
For me, that's permanently.

209
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,001
I don't believe it.

210
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,603
Well, the baby brother finally
went over the wall.

211
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,906
Yeah, we talked about it long
 enough, didn't we?

212
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,042
Yeah, but every time
I brought it up you said
you weren't ready.

213
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:43,610
Why didn't you
 tell me about it?

214
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,912
When? You haven't been
to work since Thursday.

215
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:47,880
That's true.

216
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:50,217
Come on, come on in here.
Take off your coat.

217
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:52,619
The old man say anything about
 my being away?

218
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,855
Well, not at the office.
But, boy, at home,
he's been slamming doors.

219
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,492
- Yesterday, you know that
 chandelier in the foyer?
 - Yeah.

220
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,495
- It fell down.
 - [makes whistling sound]

221
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,930
[crashing sound]

222
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,832
- Hey, where were you?
 - Vermont.

223
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:08,335
- Skiing?
 - Among other things.

224
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,370
[turns electric razor on]

225
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,107
Well, I don't know
how you do it, Alan.

226
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:17,244
- Do what?
 - If I'm at work
 one minute after nine,

227
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:20,913
he docks my pay and I think
 I get less to eat at home.

228
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,449
That's because of you
 he expects things.

229
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,317
But for me,
 he says he expects nothing.

230
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,819
That's what he thinks he gets,
 nothing. [laughs]

231
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,322
Hey, you know, the other night,
 you know what he did?

232
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,525
- No.
 - I came home about
 4:00 in the morning.

233
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:36,263
So what does he do?
 As I walk by his bedroom door,

234
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:39,166
he crows like a rooster!

235
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,435
You mean, cock-a-doodle-doo!

236
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:44,671
Yeah! [crowing]

237
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:47,874
I felt like clucking back
 like a chicken, you know?

238
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,809
But, I didn't have the nerve.

239
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:52,045
Oh, I tell you something.

240
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,181
He's beautiful.
He's a beautiful man.

241
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:55,982
Yeah, he's beautiful
all right.

242
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,350
[sighs]

243
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,487
Anyway, I figured it
 was time I got out.

244
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:03,022
So I wrote him a letter
explaining everything.

245
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:05,692
He'll get it in the morning.

246
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,994
And here I am.

247
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,330
You should be the one who's...
 [crowing]

248
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,532
I'm proud of you
 and I'm glad you're here.

249
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,034
Gee, thanks, Alan.

250
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,637
Hey...

251
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:19,839
You use a roll-on.

252
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,908
- Sure.
 - I do too.

253
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,077
And people say we're not alike.

254
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:27,046
Are they kidding, pal?

255
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,822
Boy, this is beautiful.

256
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,690
What do you call it, Alan?

257
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,859
Alpaca, it's all yours.

258
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:43,296
- Really? You mean it?
- Yeah. Wear it in good health.

259
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,765
Gee, thanks.

260
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,334
Hey, Alan?

261
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,602
Are you sure I'm not gonna
be in your way around here?

262
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,105
No, no, of course not.

263
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:55,975
But maybe we ought to work out
a kind of a, you know,
a traffic system.

264
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:00,079
- For instance, I expect a young
lady up here in a few minutes.
- A girl? Really?

265
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,416
Why didn't you tell me so?
 Look, if you want me to be
 out of the place or something,

266
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:06,986
you just say the word and, uh,
 I'll go out to a movie.

267
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:11,391
Yeah, the way things have been
working out, you might not miss
a picture all year long.

268
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:15,328
But first, we drink to your
emancipation. Come on, pal.

269
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:25,305
Alan, you really think
 I did the right thing?

270
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,840
In terms of Dad
 and all that I mean.

271
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,542
No question about it.

272
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:32,445
Now what'll you have?
Bourbon, scotch, vodka...

273
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:35,648
- Scotch. Scotch.
 - Scotch. Scotch the man says.

274
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:39,486
- And ginger ale.
 - And a little ging...

275
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,722
Oh, they must know you
 at every bar in town.

276
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:48,561
Oh, stop worrying about it, kid.

277
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,630
After all, it's not like you
deserted him completely.

278
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,332
You're still working for him,
aren't you?

279
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:55,134
[scoffs] There's gonna
 be trouble there too, Alan.

280
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:58,305
I'm thinking about
 leaving the business.

281
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:02,309
Boy, you don't fool around.
When you bust out,
you really go.

282
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:05,412
Well, it just doesn't
 interest me anymore, Alan.

283
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:09,549
Look what's going on
 in the world today.
 New countries are being born,

284
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,818
they're getting ready
to send men to the moon,

285
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:15,722
I just can't get excited about
 making artificial fruit!

286
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,757
Well, it's a business
like any other business.

287
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:20,327
Yeah, it's different for you.
 You're on the outside.

288
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:25,632
I'm on the inside,
 looking at all those
 petrified apples and grapes.

289
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:29,436
They never rot, they never turn
 brown, they never grow old!

290
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:33,240
It's like the fruit version
 of Dorian Gray.

291
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,942
The fruit version of...
Hey, that's pretty good!

292
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,477
Take a bite of that.

293
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,947
- To the Baker brothers.
- Cock-a-doodle-doo!

294
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,319
Well, how do you like it?

295
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,556
- It's different.
- It should be, you invented it.

296
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:52,725
- [doorbell chimes]
 - Oops! That'll be Peggy.

297
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:56,696
- Oh, look, I'd better...
 - No, no, no, no, no.
 Leave an anchor.

298
00:19:56,796 --> 00:20:01,301
When you see this chick, my boy,
you'll be glad you moved uptown!

299
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:08,775
Oh, my third wish, oh, genie,
 is that when I open this door

300
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,812
the most beautiful girl
 in the world will be standing
 on the other side.

301
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,618
Dad!

302
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:24,424
This is a pleasant surprise.

303
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,759
Uh...

304
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,830
How are you? How do you feel,
 Dad? How are you?

305
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:35,001
How am I? I'll tell you
 some time, that's how I am.

306
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,570
Um... I've redecorated.

307
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,938
Isn't it nice?
How do you like it?

308
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,474
Fancy. Very fancy.

309
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,743
You must have some nice job.

310
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:46,546
Well, I write half of it off
as a business expense.

311
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:49,482
Well, I mean, after all,
you won't open up a showroom

312
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,284
and I gotta take the customers
to a nice place.

313
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,553
Customers you bring to a desk.
 A desk and a pencil.

314
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:56,155
Oh, no, not today you don't.
 Today selling is different.

315
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,024
It's not like in your day.

316
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:01,694
Oh, what's the use? We've been
 through this 100 times before.

317
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:06,399
Say, seeing you reminds me
 I was gonna call you today.

318
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:09,336
The phone company shouldn't
have to depend on your business.

319
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,638
No, no, no, seriously.
 I wanted to explain.

320
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,407
- There's nothing to explain.
 - No, but there is.

321
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,142
I wanted to explain why I wasn't
in for the last two days.

322
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:20,380
No, I understand. You work
 very hard two days a week,

323
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,183
you need a five day weekend,
that's normal.

324
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,485
I'm not gonna lie to you, Dad.

325
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,153
I went skiing up in Vermont.

326
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:31,724
And I planned to be home
by Sunday, but I...
I hurt my bad ankle.

327
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,593
You know, the thing I always
have the trouble with.

328
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:36,963
I couldn't drive,
I thought it was broken.

329
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:38,865
I'll send you
a get well card.

330
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,335
Dad, I'll be in the office
 first thing in the morning.

331
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,637
That's good news.

332
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:47,907
You know the address,
 don't you?

333
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,509
Yes, Dad, I know the address.

334
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,711
I always said you were smart.

335
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,947
Now, I'll see you
 in the morning.

336
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,483
Right.

337
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,185
Ooh! By the way,

338
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,854
how is the Neiman Marcus
account doing?

339
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,089
The Neiman Marcus account?

340
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,224
Yeah, you know, Dallas,
 our biggest customer...

341
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,761
Oh! That Neiman Marcus!
It's going very well.

342
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:11,197
- Dandy, fine, fine.
- The buyer's name is Eckman...

343
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:14,300
Eckman, Eckman, Eckman. She's
coming to town next Friday.

344
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:16,736
Next Friday?

345
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,137
Yeah.

346
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:21,841
That's why she called from the
Waldorf Astoria last Friday?!

347
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:24,711
- No!
 - And again today?

348
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:28,415
Well, I suppose maybe
 she called about an order?

349
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,750
Yeah, about an order.

350
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,285
- Did we get one?
 - Yeah, we got one.

351
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:35,655
- How much?
 - Guess.

352
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,256
Oh, I don't know.
It's hard to say.

353
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,728
No! Guess how much
 we got from Eckman?

354
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,533
- Nothing?
 - Bingo!

355
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,835
Right on the button!

356
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:50,470
Bum!

357
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,771
Oh, please, Dad,
let me explain...

358
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,973
You had a nice weekend, bum?
Huh?

359
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:55,908
I honestly thought she was
coming next Friday.

360
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:59,378
Yeah. Three days she's
 at the hotel waiting.

361
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,848
While you're playing
in the snow. Huh?

362
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:03,616
- Yes.
 - Now, wait a minute, Dad.

363
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,918
No more walking,
 please, I'm tired.

364
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,888
Tomorrow morning, the first
thing, I'll call her up.
I'll explain it to her.

365
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:12,091
We're good friends.
 I promise you,
 I will not lose the account.

366
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:14,326
Why? It won't be the first one
 you ever lost.

367
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:18,130
You wanna see the list? You can
 ski down your cancellations!

368
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,734
- Skiing has nothing
 to do with it.
 - Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

369
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:27,273
I left off golf and sailing,
 sleeping and drinking, women.

370
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:31,210
If I was in the bum business,
 I would want ten like you!

371
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,280
You talk as though I put no time
at all in the business.

372
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,815
So, do you?

373
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,051
You take off legal holidays,
Jewish holidays,

374
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:43,990
Catholic holidays, last year
 you took off Halloween!

375
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,095
Look, Dad, let's face it.

376
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:52,732
You don't want me around anyway.

377
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,503
Have you ever once asked my
advice about the business?

378
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,571
Never, not once.

379
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,206
I admit, I'm not a genius.

380
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,975
But I got a couple good ideas.
You want to listen to them?

381
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,444
What does a skier know
 about wax fruit?

382
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:08,581
There you go. You won't give me
the same respect you give
the night watchman.

383
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:10,550
At least I know
 where he is at night.

384
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,318
Well, you're never gonna know
where I am at night

385
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:13,820
because what I do at night
is my business.

386
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,623
Go ahead,
 do whatever you like.

387
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:18,858
- Live like a bum.
 - Why am I a bum?!

388
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,359
- Are you married?
 - No!

389
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,894
Then you're a bum!

390
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:24,330
Well, what's all the hurry?

391
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,265
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
I'll get married.

392
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:27,734
Listen, I heard that for years

393
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:30,336
when you were 25, 30,
 35 you were a bachelor.

394
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:33,072
Now you're past 35 and
 you're still not married,

395
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:36,008
so you're a bum and that's
 all there is to it.

396
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,544
My stomach is growling.

397
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,812
Who made 35 the closing date?

398
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,549
Just answer that
question for me.

399
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:45,918
Who made 35 the closing date?

400
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:51,123
Dad, you're not listening to me.

401
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,859
Dad!

402
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,597
I'm sorry.

403
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,534
But, honest,
 I really want to know.

404
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:04,537
Why does our relationship depend
on my getting married?

405
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:05,972
Can't you love me
no matter what?

406
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:08,440
You really think
I don't love you?

407
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:14,280
Well, sometimes I wonder. You
act so strangely, I don't know.

408
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,516
Go explain parents to children.

409
00:25:20,587 --> 00:25:21,921
I know it isn't easy, Pop,

410
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,156
it's not easy for me either.

411
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,225
But I'm not a bum.

412
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:29,228
I'm just trying to get
 a little fun out of life.

413
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:33,933
I'm not unlike any other normal,
healthy, American guy.

414
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:45,311
American, you are.

415
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:50,950
Healthy... I'm not too sure.

416
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,088
And if this is normal...

417
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:58,591
...I'm an Eskimo!

418
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,928
- [clattering]
 - [Alan] Wait a minute, Dad.

419
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:03,763
I can explain
the whole thing to you.

420
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:06,232
For crying out loud,
 it was only a shoe!

421
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,367
At least I got your brother.
 He'll never be like you.

422
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:11,403
- Not in a million years!
- Yeah, well,
he might surprise you.

423
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,807
Ah, there's nothing to discuss.
 I'll see you tomorrow at the
 office at 10:00?

424
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:17,143
- OK.
 - First, you go to
 the Waldorf Astoria.

425
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,211
Straighten out with Eckman
 and get her order!

426
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,447
- I'll get the order.
 - You'll have to get up early.

427
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:24,416
No trouble at all, I was just
 getting ready to go to bed
 anyway.

428
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,153
- Yeah.
- Hi!

429
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,690
Sorry I'm late!

430
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:35,828
[nervous chuckle]
You're not late.
You're not even early.

431
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,297
As a matter of fact,
 you're in the wrong apartment.

432
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,232
I'll explain tomorrow.

433
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:44,270
It's a funny thing about
this lady, Pop, she...
She's got insomnia or something.

434
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,140
She goes around every night
and she visits people
up and down the hall.

435
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,142
And she rings...

436
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:58,718
The day your brother
becomes like you...

437
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:05,992
...I throw myself
in front of an airplane!

438
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:08,661
- [door slams]
- [chandelier creaking]

439
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:15,968
[chandelier shatters]

440
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:31,751
Boy, I thought maybe he'd
 gotten my letter already.

441
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:34,020
Boy, that took the cake.

442
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,755
Yeah.

443
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:37,690
Hello, Waldorf?

444
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,491
Would you ring Miss Eckman,
please, in 404?

445
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,227
Hey, what about that Peggy?
She's coming back up, isn't she?

446
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,996
No, I told her
 come back tomorrow.

447
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:47,333
No answer yet? Well,
 this is Alan Baker again.

448
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,301
Yes, thank you.

449
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,204
- [telephone rings]
 - Hello? Who's this?

450
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:53,639
Is that Eckman?

451
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,909
Connie. Hello, baby.

452
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,979
And it took me three weeks
 to get a date to my prom.

453
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,613
When did you get the time?

454
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:05,217
You weren't due till tomorrow.

455
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:09,188
Don't you know you can
get arrested having
a sexy voice like that?

456
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:10,890
Hm?

457
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,192
Of course you can.
 Are you kidding?

458
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:16,929
Three minutes?
 Why don't you make it two?

459
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,365
After all, I'm only human.

460
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,769
[makes biting sound]

461
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:26,205
Hey, Alan, who was that?

462
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:28,540
That, my dear young brother,
 was a girl.

463
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,476
And she's on her way
 over here.

464
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:33,045
On her way over? I thought
 you said you were bushed?

465
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:35,314
Not where this little kitten
 is concerned.

466
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:36,548
This one is different.

467
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,617
Oh, you mean this one's serious?

468
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:39,852
Alan. [clucks tongue]

469
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:41,520
Who said anything
about serious?

470
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,589
- I just said she's different.
 - Oh.

471
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:47,726
Hey, you know it sure would
solve a lot of things around
home if you got married.

472
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:51,798
I mean, after all,
Mom's had an open line to
the caterer for three years.

473
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:54,066
Me, get married?
With all of this?

474
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,002
Are you out of your
cotton-picking mind?!

475
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:58,737
- [doorbell rings]
 - Well, I...

476
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,240
I'd better get my coat.

477
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:07,346
And for my third wish,
 oh, genie...

478
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,148
Ah, who's got time?

479
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:15,287
- Eckman.
 - You mean, "Eckman, darlin'".

480
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:16,655
Don't you, lover?

481
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,058
Oh, yeah. That's right.

482
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:23,295
- Eckman, darling.
- All weekend I waited for you.

483
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:28,100
Since Friday noon.
 Where were ya... lover boy?

484
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,636
Well, I'm almost too embarrassed
to tell you, see.

485
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:32,271
I was down in Dallas...

486
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:37,076
Ow. No, really.
Eckman, baby, honest.

487
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:40,179
I knew this was our weekend
and I didn't know you were
coming here,

488
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:44,450
so I, I took a plane and
I went down to Dallas.

489
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:48,520
Oh! Ow, ow, ow. And I was
in the Dallas Hilton hotel
for three whole days

490
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,791
in my room all by myself
with a bunch of samples
of our stemless purple plums.

491
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:57,129
- Shut up, lover.
 - Would I lie to you about
 a thing like that, honey?

492
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:59,866
Of course, I could phone
the Dallas Hilton.

493
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:02,001
[stammers] Well, I'd like to ask
you to stay, but, uh...

494
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:03,802
But you're not alone?

495
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:05,237
That's right, I'm not alone.

496
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:07,239
- My kid brother's here.
- Kid brother?

497
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:10,442
- Yeah, he's here.
 - Lover, don't make me laugh.

498
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:11,944
No, I mean it. Hey, Buddy!

499
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:13,612
Hey, pal. [whistles]
 Come here, son.

500
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,814
I was just getting ready
 to leave, Alan. Hi, Connie.

501
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:17,549
- Connie?
 - Honey. Honey, he means.

502
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,952
I told you never to be forward
to people you don't know.

503
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,054
Say hello to Miss Eckman.

504
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,655
Miss Eckman, the buyer?

505
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,257
My brother.

506
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:27,960
I'm sorry, lover.

507
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,761
That's all right, baby.
Now you go on home

508
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:32,631
and get a good night's sleep.
And everything's gonna be fine.

509
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:37,136
Of course, tomorrow night,
 I want you to look absolutely
 ravishing.

510
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:39,238
But I'm due back in Dallas
 tomorrow.

511
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,240
When we got business to attend
 to? [clucks tongue]

512
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,143
- But, lover...
- Honey, tomorrow night
is all ours.

513
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:47,646
I can't wait for you to see
 those stemless purple plums.

514
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,648
All right.

515
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:52,151
- Bye, lover.
 - Bye.

516
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:59,158
- Hiya, baby!
 - I thought I heard good-bye
 in there somewhere.

517
00:30:59,258 --> 00:31:02,328
- Am I coming or going?
 - [Alan] Oh, you're coming.

518
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,968
I won't even miss
 the foreign films.

519
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:15,241
Golly, I missed you.

520
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:19,278
Come on in and I'll give you
 a chance to prove it.

521
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,716
Well, only for a minute, Alan.

522
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:28,254
- [sighs] I just
 got off the plane.
 - [door closes]

523
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:31,257
I haven't unpacked.
 I haven't even been home.

524
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:34,626
Well, that proves it.

525
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,495
I've missed you too, baby.

526
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:42,734
Oh, Alan.

527
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,536
Please don't take advantage.

528
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,974
I've got enough handicaps
 as it is.

529
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:50,742
Like what?

530
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,379
Like being on your side.

531
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,881
Oh, that's silly.

532
00:31:55,982 --> 00:31:59,318
- Oh, put that thing down.
 - I won't.

533
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,387
OK.

534
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,457
Oh, it isn't fair.

535
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:08,660
You and me...

536
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,962
...against me.

537
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:12,264
Just isn't fair!

538
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,233
One more kiss.

539
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,335
I tell you what, if it leaves
you cold, I'll quit.

540
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,971
But if it gets you all crazy,
then we play house rules.

541
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:21,873
- Alan, don't.
 - Come on, what do you say?

542
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:23,642
Oh, Alan, play fair!

543
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:26,312
I'll put my hands
behind my back, I'll spot
you a five point lead,

544
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:30,116
and I'll only be permitted
to use my underlip.

545
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:38,024
Oh, Alan, not now, please.
 I haven't even got the strength
 to put up an interesting fight.

546
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:43,095
I... I just came here
 to say I'm back.

547
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:45,497
And... to tell you something.

548
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,201
I guess it must've been
 a pretty rough tour, huh?

549
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,638
The roughest.
 And the last.

550
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,775
The last?

551
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,845
Well, that's what I came
by to tell you.

552
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:01,613
I've quit, Alan.

553
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:05,517
I mean, not just the show.
 The whole business.

554
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,553
Quit? I don't get it.

555
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,922
Everything's been going so well,
how can you give up such a
promising career?

556
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:14,193
Promising? Even you said
I was a lousy singer.

557
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:15,827
Oh, no, I didn't.

558
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:17,563
I said you had a lousy voice.

559
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:19,598
Now there's really
a difference, you know.

560
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,567
- There is?
 - Yeah.

561
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:25,104
I mean, you know, you've got
 looks, and personality.

562
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:27,839
And today, that's all you need
 in the music business.

563
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,775
Even the hockey players
are making albums.

564
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:34,012
Ooh, I'd go on, I guess,
 if I wanted it that much.

565
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:37,449
But somehow I just
 don't care anymore.

566
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:43,021
It all started when I met you.

567
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:45,023
Me?

568
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:50,729
I just don't like being away
 from you so much.

569
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:56,102
Well, um...
What do you plan to do?

570
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,306
Ooh, well, I'll manage.

571
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:03,175
I, um, could try modeling.

572
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:06,044
Or I could become a secretary.

573
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:08,347
Or a housewife.

574
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:11,250
A housewife?

575
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,784
Housewife.

576
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,688
You know, sleep-in maid.

577
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,091
I don't... I don't follow you.

578
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:21,893
It was a joke. [laughs]

579
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:23,362
And you don't get it.

580
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:26,432
[sarcastic laughter]
 I got it, I got it.

581
00:34:26,532 --> 00:34:30,202
Well, don't act like we've never
discussed it on this very couch.

582
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,338
Or were they just
 campaign promises?

583
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:35,841
And what if they were?
I never won the election anyway.

584
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:37,243
Ohh...

585
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:40,279
Oh, I'm sorry.

586
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,348
I guess maybe I was just...

587
00:34:42,448 --> 00:34:44,683
...pressing a little too hard.

588
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,324
Yeah, I guess maybe you're just
tired from such a long journey.

589
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,794
Yeah, that's it.
 I'm a little tired.

590
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:58,997
- Will I see you tomorrow?
 - If you want.

591
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,500
I want.

592
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,237
- Do I get a good night kiss?
 - Mm-hm.

593
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:07,473
Wanna kiss me here
 or at the elevator?

594
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:11,543
Well, why don't we start here
 and finish at the elevator?

595
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,457
[whistling]

596
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:27,493
Hey, Alan, you know what I've
been thinking?

597
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:31,330
Living here with you,
I may never have to eat
a meal over a sink again.

598
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:35,567
I mean, you're gonna let me sit
in a chair and eat at a table.

599
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,536
Just like real people,
aren't ya?

600
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,837
[laughs]

601
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:41,840
Take it easy, son, not so fast.
You might get the bends.

602
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,309
Crazy. Hey, listen, Alan.

603
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:46,712
By the way, how do you
 afford this place?

604
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,980
- What do you mean?
 - Well, I heard you tell Dad

605
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,849
that you write part of it off
 as a business expense,

606
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:53,051
but, gee, the rest of it must
 cost a fortune.

607
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,688
Well, it's a kind of a
 peculiar situation.

608
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:58,557
- [Buddy] Yeah?
- Um...

609
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,392
Skip it. I'll tell you about it
another time.

610
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,561
OK, but how much is my rent?

611
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:06,632
I mean, you know,
 I wanna pay my share
 or I don't wanna live here.

612
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:08,900
We'll talk about it the first
of the month, all right?

613
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,338
OK. We split everything,
50-50.

614
00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:14,773
Gas, lights, telephone.

615
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,275
Agreed?

616
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,781
[sighs]

617
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,952
Boy, what a birthday.

618
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:28,820
What birthday?

619
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,924
Well, actually it was
 last week, but...

620
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,626
Holy smokes,
I forgot all about it.

621
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:37,195
- You were 21 years old.
- Yeah.

622
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:42,167
- Happy birthday, kid.
 - Thanks, Alan.

623
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:44,236
Least I could've done
was to buy you a present.

624
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:47,706
[scoffs] I wouldn't lose
any sleep over that.

625
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:49,475
Good night, kid.

626
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:51,643
[yawns] Good night, Alan.

627
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:05,023
Mom... Mom!

628
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,392
Mom...

629
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:09,295
Mom, Mom,
I just can't come home.

630
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:11,497
Well, all right,
I'll think about it.

631
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:15,000
But, Mom, listen, please,
don't tear up that letter.

632
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,568
I said I'd think about it.

633
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:19,438
I will! Mom, I'll call you.

634
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,707
Later. Yeah, I promise.

635
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:23,442
OK. OK, Mom, now...

636
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,176
Mom, listen, please.

637
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:26,878
Please don't tear up
that letter.

638
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:30,516
OK, Mom. OK. Bye-bye.

639
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,251
How bad is she?

640
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:36,054
Oh. Oh, she's terrible.

641
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:40,225
Gee, last night
 Dad came home and
 he carried on something awful.

642
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:43,629
She was closing windows
all night long.

643
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:45,464
You mean he didn't get
the letter yet, huh?

644
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:49,200
No, he went to the office
 before the letter came.

645
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:50,836
[exhales]

646
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,204
She's afraid that he's gonna get
that thing and read it and

647
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:56,007
just go to pieces
 altogether.

648
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:01,913
Well...
what do you wanna do?

649
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,351
I don't know.

650
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:08,186
Maybe...

651
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,355
Maybe I should go home.

652
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:11,289
Go home? Why?

653
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,692
Mom's so upset.

654
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,898
What am I supposed to do?

655
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,633
Grow up.

656
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,335
Sure.

657
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:25,771
Come out of your shell.
You're 21 years old now.

658
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:28,340
Do you mean I should just forget
about the whole thing?

659
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,275
You've earned your freedom.

660
00:38:30,376 --> 00:38:32,678
Now go out and have
 a fling at life.

661
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:35,647
Take a bite out of
the real fruit of life.

662
00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:39,751
Maybe you're right.

663
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,621
- Then you'll stay.
 - Why not?

664
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:44,690
That's the kid brother I love.

665
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,859
Now the first thing we gotta do
is get rid of those square
clothes.

666
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,529
Hm?

667

Yeah, we're gonna make you over
from head-to-toe.

668
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,467
Come on.

669
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,980
[coins jingling]

670
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,652
* Make like a Mr. Milquetoast

671
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:49,387

675
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:01,132
* Wham, you're shorn

00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:09,274
* Make like a Mr. Mumbles

678
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:11,877
* And you're a zero

679
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:14,480
* Make like a Mr. Big

680
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,383
* They dig a hero

681
00:40:18,484 --> 00:40:20,318
* You've got to sound 
 your "A" *

682
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,654
* The day you're born

683
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:28,126
* I tell you chum it's time

684
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:41,339

685
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,909
* The sweeter the peach

00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:47,679
* I'll give you 
 the whole magilla *

687
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,915

688
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:51,416

694
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,033

00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:12,771
* I tell you chum it's time

696
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,044
* In civilized jungles

697

00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:34,325
* You can be

702
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,128
* Or be the reader

703
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:41,199
* You can be 
 either lead *

704
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,835
* Or be the leader

705
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:51,109
* Don't wait until you're told 
 you're old and worn *

706
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:54,012
* Take in some air 
 and get your lips puckered *

707
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:57,215
* Before you find you're simply 
 too tuckered *

708
00:41:57,315 --> 00:42:00,118

711
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:03,548
[no audio]

712
00:43:03,649 --> 00:43:06,084
[honking]

713
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:44,255
[light chattering]

714
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:54,032
You know, I never had
 a martini before.

715
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,500
It's about time.

716
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,736
- Here's looking at you.
- Thanks, Alan.

717
00:43:57,836 --> 00:44:00,171
And I might add,
it's a pleasure.

718
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:02,908
Extreme pleasure.

719
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,779
- Another one?
 - Certainly.

720
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:09,280
I'm gonna need
a gross of these tonight.

721
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,382
I've not only got Eckman,
I've got Connie on my hands.

722
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:15,353
- A double-header.
 - Hey, it's a triple-header.
 You forgot Peggy.

723
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:18,289
Yeah, I forgot about Peggy.

724
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:21,259
You know, you ought to get one
 of those little maps

725
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:24,395
with the stick pins in them, so
you know where everybody is.

726
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,631
Hey, I got an idea.
 What are you doing tonight?

727
00:44:26,732 --> 00:44:27,999
Why?

728
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:29,868
I'd like to have you
take Peggy off my hands.

729
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:32,603
Me?! She's expecting you.

730
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:34,505
All you do is turn
the lights down low

731
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,908
and she won't figure it out
until she's on her way
down the elevator.

732
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,677
- You're crazy.
 - No, that's how I met her.

733
00:44:39,778 --> 00:44:41,913
She rang the wrong bell
one night.

734
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:46,484
Alan, look, Peggy, she probably
babysits for guys like me.

735
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:48,553
Will you trust me, Buddy boy?

736
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:50,021
She'll be crazy about you.

737
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:52,590
Nah, she won't. Nah, nah.

738
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,625
Nah, I just can't do it,
Alan. Nah, nah.

739
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:57,028
I got other plans
 tonight anyway.

740
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,897
You've got other...
What kind of plans?

741
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:02,233
Well, there's an emergency
 UN meeting on television

742
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,770
and I'm gonna watch it.

743
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:08,807
The UN? You know that
if I offered this deal

744
00:45:08,907 --> 00:45:11,076
to the Security Consulate
they'd call the meeting off?

745
00:45:11,176 --> 00:45:14,645
Look, Alan, I don't know
 if you care about what's
 going on in the world today,

746
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:18,283
but I do. I'm watching
 telebision.

747
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:21,286
[laughs] You're watching what?

748
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:23,021
Telebision.

749
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,623
Say that again,
I didn't read you.

750
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:29,260
Telebision. Tel-e-bision.

751
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,229
[both laugh]

752
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:34,032
Let me tell you something.
I wouldn't watch anything
I couldn't pronounce.

753
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:36,367
All right, you pronounce it.

754
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,069
Telebision.

755
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:41,106
Now, will you take Peggy
off my hands?

756
00:45:41,206 --> 00:45:43,842
OK, OK. But she better like
 telebision,

757
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:46,377
or I won't take her
 off your hands.

758
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:57,422
Look, Alan, I don't care what I
said before. The answer's no.

759
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:59,324
I'm not seeing Peggy.

760
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:03,594
I don't understand.
What gives with you?

761
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,696
Are you afraid or something?

762
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:07,698
- Well...
- You're afraid.

763
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:09,968
No, I'm not afraid.

764
00:46:10,068 --> 00:46:13,271
All right, I wanted to get you
a birthday present anyway.

765
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:15,606
And I found something
you haven't got.

766
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:19,811
I don't want another birthday
 present, I'm really very happy
 the way I am.

767
00:46:19,911 --> 00:46:21,312
Will you do me a favor,
please, Buddy?

768
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:23,781
I can't handle three dates
all by myself.

769
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:26,484
So if you don't want to do it
for me, do it for yourself.
What do you say?

770
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:29,787
- No, I really don't want...
 - That's my kid brother.

771
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:31,389
Ten-J, please.

772
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,892
I'm gonna set you up
so perfectly, you'll
be thanking me

773
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:35,726
for the rest of your life.

774
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:38,396
Peg? Hello, sweetheart.

775
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,731
How are ya?

776
00:46:40,832 --> 00:46:43,301
Listen, I got good news
and I got bad news.

777
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,803
First, the bad news.
I can't see you tonight.

778
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:48,573
No, I got some important
business to take care of.

779
00:46:48,673 --> 00:46:51,076
Now, are you ready
for the good news?

780
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:52,911
He's here.

781
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:54,946
- Macintosh.
 - Who?

782
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:58,049
Paul Macintosh, the producer
 from Paramount.

783
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,717
- What?!
- Yeah, he got in this morning.

784
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,586
He's staying with me
in my apartment tonight.

785
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:04,122
- He wants to meet you.
- Sorry, Alan.

786
00:47:04,956 --> 00:47:07,592
Well, don't thank me,
sweetheart.

787
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:09,827
No, I'm doing him the favor.

788
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:12,663
Yeah, in about ten minutes?
Yeah, that'll be fine.

789
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:14,532
- Bye.
 - [hangs up telephone]

790
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:17,135
Well, the ball is over the fence
now all you gotta do
is run the bases.

791
00:47:17,235 --> 00:47:19,637
Are you out of your mind?
 Me, a producer?!

792
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:22,440
- You wanna be a director?
I'll call her back.
- No! Don't do that.

793
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:27,145
- Look, Alan, doesn't she know
 what this McQuillan...
 - Macintosh.

794
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:29,414
- Doesn't she know what
Macintosh looks like?
- No! I made him up.

795
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:32,283
Made him? Well, what if she
 calls Paramount and finds
 out...

796
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:35,720
She doesn't even know
how to dial. She's been
auditioning all of her life.

797
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,490
- She loves being discovered.
 - What am I supposed to do,
 make her a star?

798
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,326
No, just give her a little part
in the picture.

799
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:43,995
- What picture?!
 - Ha! How do I know?
 Make one up.

800
00:47:44,095 --> 00:47:48,033
Look, you're my kid brother.
 When the chips are down,
 you'll come through.

801
00:47:48,133 --> 00:47:50,068
- But, Alan...
 - Oh, this is gonna be

802
00:47:50,168 --> 00:47:52,938
the most beautiful night
of your life, pal.

803
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:55,173
Happy birthday.

804
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:57,575
Happy birthday.

805
00:47:57,675 --> 00:48:02,080
Why couldn't he give me a tie
 like everybody else?

806
00:48:10,688 --> 00:48:12,423
[doorbell rings]

807
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:19,630
OK, I'm coming. Just a minute.

808
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:32,210
Mom!

809
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,445
Oh, darling,
I'm so glad you're here.

810
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:37,548
- Mom, are you all right?
 - Get me a glass of water,
 darling.

811
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:41,152
- I almost fainted
 on the subway.
 - Mom, why'd you come here?

812
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:44,589
And then I got such
a dizzy spell, I thought
I'd never get here.

813
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:47,658
What'd you come here for? I told
you I'd call you tomorrow.
What do you want?

814
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,427
Get me a glass of water,
darling.

815
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:51,262
But, uh...

816
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,531
Oh.

817
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:58,069
Mom, uh, I hope you'll
 understand this, but, uh...

818
00:48:58,169 --> 00:49:02,340
- I have an appointment tonight.
- Oh, my feet. These shoes are
killing me.

819
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:08,379
Look, you see, I have this
 appointment and uh...

820
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:11,516
- Oh, here.
 - Thank you.

821
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:13,151
There, feel better?

822
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:16,087
When did I ever feel better?

823
00:49:16,754 --> 00:49:18,889
Ooh, look at the dirt.

824
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,891
- Look at this place.
 - It's all right, Mom.

825
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:24,729
It looks all right?
I bet no one's been in here
to clean in a year.

826
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:26,197
Mom, will you,
will you listen to me?

827
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:29,267
Uh, there's a girl coming up
here in just a minute.

828
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:31,469
- To clean?
 - No, not to clean.

829
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:34,805
- Uh, she's a friend of mine.
 - Oh. From our neighborhood?

830
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:37,208
No, not exactly.
You wouldn't know her.

831
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:39,077
Uh, she's a friend
of mine from college

832
00:49:39,177 --> 00:49:41,012
and we're, uh, writing
a book together.

833
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:44,182
Buddy, I want to talk to you
 about your father.

834
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:46,751
Mom, we can't talk right now
 because she's gonna be here in
 just a minute.

835
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:49,387
- You told me not to
 tear up the letter.
 - Oh, I did.

836
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,389
- I bet you didn't
 either, did you, Mom?
 - Course I didn't.

837
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,991
- Right.
 - But now when he comes home,
 he's gonna read it

838
00:49:54,092 --> 00:49:56,494
and then you could get killed
 from the fallout.

839
00:49:56,594 --> 00:49:58,696
Yeah, well, we can't talk about
all that right now.

840
00:49:58,796 --> 00:50:00,331
He's gonna blame it all on me.

841
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:02,667
He's gonna say I was too soft
 with both of you.

842
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:06,904
He's gonna say,
 "Because of you, my sister
 Gussie has two grandchildren

843
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,040
and all I have
is a bum and a letter."

844
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:13,144
- I know him.
 - Yeah, well, Mom, supposing I
 come home tomorrow night, OK?

845
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:16,547
- And talk to Dad about
everything? OK?
- Fine, fine.

846
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:19,284
- Uh, will you come to dinner?
 - Oh, yeah. I promise.

847
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:22,953
- I promise.
 - So what'll I make?

848
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:24,889
- What?
- For dinner?
What do you want to eat?

849
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:28,459
Oh! Anything, Mom.
 Anything's fine. Yeah.

850
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:34,799
- Bye!
- I want to make something you
like, now that you're not home.

851
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:36,467
OK, how about roast beef?

852
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:39,270
Roast beef? Fine.
I'll make a nice roast beef.

853
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,706
- OK, good.
 - We had roast beef Monday.

854
00:50:41,806 --> 00:50:44,442
- I can eat it again.
 - Yeah? All right, darling.

855
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:46,544
- OK.
 - Maybe I should get a turkey.

856
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,646
- A nice, big turkey.
 - Well, all right.

857
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:52,217
- A turkey sounds just great.
 Fine, Mom, fine. Bye.
 - OK.

858
00:50:52,317 --> 00:50:55,186
No, it doesn't pay.
 A big turkey for three people.

859
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:56,821
Mom, for heaven's sakes,
make anything you like.

860
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:59,490
Make turkey or roast beef.
 I don't care what it is.

861
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:03,594
I'll be there. Now, you just run
along home and relax.

862
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:05,763
And take everything easy.
 Take a cab.

863
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:09,434
Take a cab.
 Where am I gonna get a cab?

864
00:51:09,534 --> 00:51:12,803
Well... I'll get one for you.

865
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:17,108
- You just wait right there.
 - Don't rush.

866
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:18,709
To whom am I talking to?

867
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:21,912
[groans] My feet.

868
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,649
These shoes are killing me.

869
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,193
[humming]

870
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:54,312
[telephone ringing]

871
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:03,554
Hello? Who?

872
00:52:03,654 --> 00:52:08,159
No, he isn't. To whom am I
 speaking to, please?

873
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:11,462
Eckman. Mrs. Eckman?

874
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:13,964
No, no, no.

875
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:17,034
No, this is Alan's mother.

876
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:21,206
What? Why should I kid
about a thing like that?

877
00:52:22,307 --> 00:52:25,710
No, I am positive
 he is not here.

878
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:30,248
A message? Wait a minute.
 I'll get a pencil.

879
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:47,332
[telephone ringing]

880
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:55,039
Hello?

881
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:57,808
Ohh... Mrs. Eckman?

882
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,477
[stammers, laughs]

883
00:52:59,577 --> 00:53:02,647
Well, excuse me, Mrs. Eckman,
 I couldn't find a pencil.

884
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:06,150
Talk fast so I can write it down
as soon as you're finished.

885
00:53:06,251 --> 00:53:08,353
This is extremely important.

886
00:53:08,453 --> 00:53:12,189
I just learned my husband
 flew in from Dallas tonight.

887
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,959
From Dallas, that's right.

888
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:17,895
I've checked out of the Waldorf,

889
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:19,530
and into the Hampshire House.

890
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,866
I'll wait here.
 Do you have that?

891
00:53:21,966 --> 00:53:27,204
Yes. It's extremely important,
 you just learned your husband

892
00:53:27,305 --> 00:53:29,374
is flying in
 from Dallas tonight.

893
00:53:29,474 --> 00:53:31,476
And you checked out
 of the Waldorf

894
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:33,811
and into the Hampshire House,

895
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:35,145
and you'll wait there.

896
00:53:35,246 --> 00:53:37,181
Yes, yes, I have it.

897
00:53:37,282 --> 00:53:40,084
Well, I do.
 No, I can't repeat it,

898
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:43,654
I'm trying to remember.
 Please, don't talk anymore

899
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:46,524
I'm going to write it down
 quickly. Good-bye.

900
00:53:46,624 --> 00:53:50,227
Some message.
 It's a book, not a message.

901
00:53:50,328 --> 00:53:53,764
Where's a pencil? Humph.

902
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:56,767
How could they not
 have a pencil?

903
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:58,603
[telephone rings]

904
00:54:03,508 --> 00:54:07,445
Suddenly I'm an answering
 service?

905
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,149
Hello? Who?

906
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,451
No, no, he's out.

907
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:16,253
This is Alan's mother.

908
00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:19,390
Why should I kid about
 a thing like that?

909
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,360
To whom am I speaking, please?

910
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,195
Eckman. Mr. Eckman?

911
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:28,198
Eckman, where did I hear that
 name before?

912
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:31,669
Well, ma'am,
you tell your son for me

913
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:35,005
that a little birdie down in
 Dallas told me all about him.

914
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,475
Now I don't know whether I'm
 gonna get the pleasure of
 meeting up with him

915
00:54:37,575 --> 00:54:42,713
this trip or not, because
evidently I got to the Waldorf
a little bit too late.

916
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:45,483
But when I do meet up with him,
you tell him for me,

917
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:48,586
that I'm gonna tear
 his hide off. Yeah.

918
00:54:48,686 --> 00:54:51,456
Wait a minute.
 Wait a minute, Mr. Eckman,

919
00:54:51,556 --> 00:54:54,459
I just remembered where I heard
your name. Your wife.

920
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,462
Yes, I talked to her
 just a minute ago.

921
00:54:57,562 --> 00:54:59,397
You see, when you said
 the Waldorf,

922
00:54:59,497 --> 00:55:01,966
everything came back to me.

923
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:03,534
[stammers] What?

924
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,703
I should hurry up and tell you?

925
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:10,675
Look, Mr. Eckman, I am not a
 secretary. I am just a mother.

926
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:13,411
Without a pencil.
 All right, all right!

927
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:17,415
All I know is she checked out
 of the Waldorf and she's
 checking into the...

928
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:19,617
...into the...

929
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:22,587
Something with a "pencil" in it.
I mean with a "house" in it.

930
00:55:22,687 --> 00:55:26,156
- The Hampshire House?
- Yeah, yeah. That's it.

931
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:28,092
The Hampshire House. Yeah.

932
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:31,128
All right, never mind the
 thanks. Better let me hang up.

933
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:32,763
Good-bye.

934
00:55:34,131 --> 00:55:38,335
Businessman, college graduate.
 Doesn't have a pencil.

935
00:55:38,436 --> 00:55:39,970
Huh!

936
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:42,139
[telephone ringing]

937
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:45,476
Oh, for heaven sake.

938
00:55:45,576 --> 00:55:47,945
All right,
 what do you want from me?

939
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:56,721
Yes. Who?

940
00:55:56,821 --> 00:55:58,789
Who do you want?

941
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:01,892
No, no. He's out.
 This is Alan's mother.

942
00:56:01,992 --> 00:56:05,195
Listen, don't start
 that with me.

943
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:08,265
Who is this? Connie what?

944
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,167
Again with the message.

945
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:13,871
Look... [grunting] miss,

946
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:18,308
maybe you can write it down.
 I don't have a pencil.

947
00:56:18,409 --> 00:56:22,179
All right, yes.
Yes. yes.

948
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:24,114
Yes, you're welcome. Good-bye!

949
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:28,586
Good-bye, good luck, go home.
 Who knows what she said?

950
00:56:32,657 --> 00:56:36,026
[groans] Who tells him to have
 so many phone calls?

951
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:38,463
- It's disgusting.
 - [telephone rings]

952
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:41,398
What do they want from my life?!

953
00:56:44,502 --> 00:56:48,673
I wouldn't answer it now
if it stood on its head.

954
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:51,876
I'm getting dizzy.

955
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:55,946
Yes? What is it?

956
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:58,983
Who is this? Alan who?

957
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:01,686
A... Alan?

958
00:57:01,786 --> 00:57:03,521
This is your mother!

959
00:57:03,621 --> 00:57:05,422
Did anyone call?

960
00:57:05,523 --> 00:57:07,257
The whole world called.

961
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:09,026
Mrs. Eckman? Oh, yeah.

962
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:12,229
She's at the Hampshire House
 and she's waiting for you.

963
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:14,632
- [Buddy] OK, Mom, let's go.
 - I gotta go now.

964
00:57:14,732 --> 00:57:17,301
Yes, darling. Who?
 Other messages?

965
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:21,606
Who remembers?
 Be glad I was here or you
 wouldn't have that one.

966
00:57:21,706 --> 00:57:25,543
Mom, hurry up. The cab's
downstairs waiting.

967
00:57:30,981 --> 00:57:33,450
Oh, I only hope I don't
pass out in the taxi.

968
00:57:33,551 --> 00:57:35,152
Don't worry, Mom, you won't.

969
00:57:35,252 --> 00:57:36,887
Bye.

970
00:57:38,723 --> 00:57:41,391
Oh, boy, I couldn't handle Peggy
before, but now!

971
00:57:41,492 --> 00:57:43,961
I gotta get out of here.

972
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:46,731
I'll write her a note.

973
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:50,234
Let's see, a pencil, pencil.

974
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,642
"Dear Peggy.

975
00:57:58,509 --> 00:58:02,513
More bad news.

976
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:05,950
Paul Macintosh...

977
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:10,721
...is... dead.

978
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:14,692
Love, Alan."

979
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:21,932
[doorbell rings]

980
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:33,844
Hi! I'm Peggy John.

981
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:38,015
Hi. I'm, I'm not disturbing you
or anything, am I?

982
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:42,319
- Oh, no. Not at all.
 - Oh, good.

983
00:58:42,419 --> 00:58:44,521
Alan said you wanted to see me.

984
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:49,426
I do hope you forgive
 the way I look, but it's
 been a rather hectic day.

985
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,629
Yeah, it sure has.
I know what you mean.

986
00:58:51,729 --> 00:58:55,966
Oh, I mean...
No, you look, uh... nice.

987
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:59,870
Oh, thanks. Coming from you,
that's something.

988
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:03,173
It's a shame you couldn't
 get up to the ski lodge.

989
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:04,541
Oh, what ski lodge?

990
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:08,145
In New Hampshire.
 Or was it Vermont?

991
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:10,180
I'm terrible with names.

992
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,117
In fact, I'm afraid
 I've forgotten yours.

993
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,786
Oh, it's Macintosh.

994
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:19,189
- Fred Macintosh.
 - No. Yes. Fred Macintosh.

995
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:21,025
Right, that's me.

996
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:27,564
- Oh, would you
 like to sit down?
 - Oh, thank you.

997
00:59:27,665 --> 00:59:30,935
I understand you just flew out
 from Hollywood.

998
00:59:31,035 --> 00:59:34,204
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, I did.

999
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:38,609
Uh, would you like a drink?

1000
00:59:38,709 --> 00:59:41,545
Ooh! Just like a transfusion.

1001
00:59:41,646 --> 00:59:44,448
I don't mind admitting it,
 but I'm nervous.

1002
00:59:44,548 --> 00:59:46,150
You're nervous?

1003
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,351
Why would you be nervous?

1004
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:48,753
Well, you know.

1005
00:59:48,853 --> 00:59:51,355
Meeting an important
movie producer like yourself

1006
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:53,858
- under these circumstances.
 - Yeah, I know what you mean.

1007
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:56,060
- You do?
 - Yeah, sure.

1008
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,595
[stammers] I used to
 feel like that myself.

1009
00:59:58,696 --> 01:00:00,564
- Really?
 - Uh-huh.

1010
01:00:00,665 --> 01:00:01,866
Now what would you
like to drink?

1011
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:04,001
Well, what are you having?

1012
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,737
Oh, a scotch and ginger ale.

1013
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:09,173
Scotch and ginger ale?

1014
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:12,042
Is that the latest kick
 out on the coast?

1015
01:00:12,142 --> 01:00:14,344
Oh! Oh, yeah!

1016
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,947
- I think that's cute!
 - You do?

1017
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:19,650
Oh, yes, I think it's darling!

1018
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:23,220
It's just adorable!

1019
01:00:33,898 --> 01:00:35,733
- Howdy.
 - Yes, sir?

1020
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:37,267
You got a Mrs. Eckman
 registered?

1021
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:39,236
- I beg your pardon.
 - A Mrs. Eckman?

1022
01:00:39,336 --> 01:00:41,571
Mrs. Eckman.
 Yes, she just checked in.

1023
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:44,341
Ten-fifteen-A.

1024
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,329
- You have a Mrs. Eckman here?
 - Eckman?

1025
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:09,299
Yes. Ten-fifteen-A.

1026
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:11,936
Ten-fifteen-A.

1027
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,976
- And a boo to you...
 - [gasps]

1028
01:01:52,076 --> 01:01:55,079
Oh, did I scare you?
I didn't mean to, dear.

1029
01:01:55,179 --> 01:01:57,848
Don't be afraid of Waldo,
he's harmless.

1030
01:01:58,983 --> 01:02:01,451
I'm the one you have to be
 afraid of.

1031
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,888
Come here, baby.

1032
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,466
Mm...

1033
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,468
Honey, guess what?

1034
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,737
I got my contact lenses today.

1035
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:23,407
Yeah, I did. See, they're right
there in my eye.

1036
01:02:23,507 --> 01:02:26,276
Well, can't see them, can you?

1037
01:02:26,376 --> 01:02:28,245
They're just... It's incredible
what they do for me.

1038
01:02:28,345 --> 01:02:29,914
Here, let me show you
how they work.

1039
01:02:30,014 --> 01:02:33,317
You see, you open your eye
like that and they drop...

1040
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:35,252
...right in your hand.

1041
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:43,293
The doctor said all you do is
 just spread they eye,
 and they drop out.

1042
01:02:43,393 --> 01:02:47,131
Well, they're supposed to drop
 right in your hand.

1043
01:02:48,833 --> 01:02:50,334
They're not coming out.

1044
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:52,202
Course they're not coming out.
You know why?

1045
01:02:52,302 --> 01:02:56,473
Because they're not there.
I left them in the doctor's
office.

1046
01:02:56,573 --> 01:03:00,911
Now, Helen, isn't that
the stupidest thing
you ever heard of ?

1047
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:03,247
You are Helen Lovequist,
aren't you?

1048
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:08,785
Good heavens,
 I made a dreadful mistake.

1049
01:03:08,886 --> 01:03:11,555
This isn't even Helen's room.

1050
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:13,457
Oh, how do you do, sir.

1051
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:15,559
You must be
 this young lady's father.

1052
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:17,361
My name is Spencer.
Jefferson Spencer.

1053
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:20,530
I'm terribly sorry.
My apologies to the little lady.

1054
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:25,469
- I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.
 - I'm mighty happy to have met
 you, Mr. Baker.

1055
01:03:25,569 --> 01:03:27,437
Oh, well, thank you...

1056
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:32,910
[Alan] Down, please.

1057
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:43,020
[Connie] I could've had a steak
ready at the apartment.

1058
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:45,789
But who knew you were fighting
 lady heavyweights these days.

1059
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:47,624
Oh, come on, Connie.

1060
01:03:47,724 --> 01:03:52,662
I explained. I told you I ran
into the door of the taxi cab.

1061
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:54,398
I couldn't understand last night

1062
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:57,301
why you were fighting so hard
 to keep me in show business.

1063
01:03:57,401 --> 01:04:00,804
- It's suddenly very clear.
 - What's very clear?

1064
01:04:00,905 --> 01:04:04,574
It's not my career
 you're worried about,
 it's yours.

1065
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,210
- My career?
 - As a lover.

1066
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:09,479
Who were you with just now,
 Alan?

1067
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,448
Was she pretty?

1068
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:13,750
Oh, honey. Look...

1069
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,452
You know I'm nuts about you.

1070
01:04:15,552 --> 01:04:17,521
Now why do you act like this?

1071
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:23,093
- What's that?
 - Mashed potatoes and peas.
 They come with the steak.

1072
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:25,562
The steak's for my eye.
 What am I gonna do with that?

1073
01:04:25,662 --> 01:04:29,433
For all I care, you can
stick it in your ear.
It comes with the order.

1074
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:35,805
Don't be mad at me, sweetheart.

1075
01:04:35,906 --> 01:04:38,842
Oh, Alan, I'm not mad.

1076
01:04:38,943 --> 01:04:40,710
I'm serious.

1077
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,479
I'm serious about you.

1078
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:43,914
You know what I mean?

1079
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:47,884
Well, sure,
I know what you mean.

1080
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:49,453
Well, for some strange reason

1081
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:52,022
I felt you felt
 the same way I did.

1082
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:54,124
I mean, these past
 six months were...

1083
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:56,793
Well, they were wonderful,
 right?

1084
01:04:56,893 --> 01:05:00,230
That's why I don't
 want to see them end.

1085
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:02,132
End?

1086
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:04,034
Alan...

1087
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:06,803
Alan, you might be
 surprised to learn...

1088
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,039
...that some people
think of getting serious

1089
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:10,975
as a beginning...

1090
01:05:11,075 --> 01:05:13,177
...not an end.

1091
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:26,323
- Connie, wait a minute. Wait a
minute, dear.
- No!

1092
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:29,326
This isn't fair to either of us.
Now let's talk about it for a
minute.

1093
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,461
- No.
 - Look, I got a good idea.

1094
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:33,897
Look, I have never been
in a handsome cab.

1095
01:05:33,998 --> 01:05:38,602
So why don't we go
 up to Central Park and we'll
 take a ride in a handsome cab?

1096
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:43,207
And we'll talk this whole thing
out. Would you like a ride in a
handsome cab?

1097
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:47,044
OK.

1098
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:54,818
Hey, buddy, would you help a
 fella out? I ain't ate in two
 days.

1099
01:05:54,918 --> 01:05:56,620
Huh? Come on, what do you say?

1100
01:06:04,861 --> 01:06:08,432
Why didn't I tell him the truth?
Why did I have to lie, huh?

1101
01:06:08,532 --> 01:06:11,235
Why didn't I tell him
 what I really wanted?

1102
01:06:11,935 --> 01:06:13,403
Oh.

1103
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:18,542
You know, Mr. Macintosh,

1104
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:20,710
I'm sure you've
 heard this before,

1105
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,047
but you look awfully young
 to be a producer.

1106
01:06:23,147 --> 01:06:27,817
- I do?
 - To look at you, I'd say
 you were only about 29.

1107
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:30,054
But I bet I'm way off!

1108
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:31,755
Yeah, you're way off all right.

1109
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:33,857
Well, now, down to business.

1110
01:06:33,957 --> 01:06:37,461
- What?
 - Well, I suppose you'll want
 to know what I've done.

1111
01:06:37,561 --> 01:06:39,163
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not necessarily.

1112
01:06:39,263 --> 01:06:41,098
I'll be perfectly
 honest with you.

1113
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:43,700
I've never been
 in a movie before.

1114
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:47,003
- Is that right?
 - But I'm not totally
 inexperienced.

1115
01:06:47,104 --> 01:06:48,638
That's what Alan told me.

1116
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:52,542
Last summer, when I was
 on the coast, I did a TV film.

1117
01:06:52,642 --> 01:06:55,345
- No kidding?
 - I was a dead body.

1118
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:57,614
They fished me out of the river.

1119
01:06:57,714 --> 01:06:59,916
I think I saw that.

1120
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,118
Is that so?!

1121
01:07:01,218 --> 01:07:02,886
Oh, yeah. You were very good.

1122
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:04,754
Oh, thank you!

1123
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:09,793
Really now, I think that's the
 most remarkable coincidence.

1124
01:07:09,893 --> 01:07:11,295
[chuckles] How 'bout that?

1125
01:07:11,395 --> 01:07:14,231
And just think,
a year later here we are.

1126
01:07:14,331 --> 01:07:16,500
Life is funny, isn't it?

1127
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,035
Yeah. Hysterical.

1128
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:23,807
Well, is there anything
you'd like me to do?

1129
01:07:25,075 --> 01:07:26,410
What?

1130
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:28,212
Well, do.

1131
01:07:28,312 --> 01:07:29,713
Like, read a scene

1132
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:32,882
or do a take-off on a character,
like in class.

1133
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:36,720
Or maybe just talking like this
is enough.

1134
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:38,955
It's plenty.

1135
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,991
As a matter of fact,
I'm a little tired.

1136
01:07:42,092 --> 01:07:43,960
Oh, of course!

1137
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,130
- From the trip.
- Right, from the trip.

1138
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:49,933
Would you like me to massage
 your think muscle?

1139
01:07:50,033 --> 01:07:51,435
- Huh?
- Here.

1140
01:07:51,535 --> 01:07:55,572
Now, you just close
 your eyes and relax.

1141
01:07:55,672 --> 01:07:59,576
- Oh, no, really. I...
 - No, no.
 No, I'm very good at this.

1142
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:02,446
Now just relax,
 and try and forget

1143
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:05,582
all about
 the picture business.

1144
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,418
No. I can feel it.

1145
01:08:08,518 --> 01:08:11,054
You're still thinking
 about the studio.

1146
01:08:11,155 --> 01:08:12,689
Oh, no. No, I'm not.

1147
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:14,291
How inconsiderate of me,

1148
01:08:14,391 --> 01:08:17,761
making you talk business
 on your first night here.

1149
01:08:17,861 --> 01:08:20,530
No wonder you're so tense.

1150
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:23,633
- Yeah.
 - But I'll make it up to you.

1151
01:08:23,733 --> 01:08:27,437
I know how to get all that
 tenseness right out of you.

1152
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,908
You do? How?

1153
01:08:32,008 --> 01:08:33,477
Television!

1154
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:38,081
Greatest relaxer there is,
 isn't it?

1155
01:08:38,182 --> 01:08:39,949
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

1156
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:42,652
You know, Mr. Macintosh,

1157
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:45,489
you ought to be
 in your own pictures.

1158
01:08:45,589 --> 01:08:47,691
That's an interesting show.

1159
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:50,794
I mean... you're cute.

1160
01:08:50,894 --> 01:08:53,497
Hey, you're gonna
 miss all the fun.

1161
01:08:53,597 --> 01:08:58,235
Oh, you're so tense,
 Mr. Macintosh.

1162
01:08:58,335 --> 01:09:00,304
You should relax.

1163
01:09:00,404 --> 01:09:05,975
You're sweet, so adorable,
 Mr. Macintosh.

1164
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:07,911
[makes kissing sound]

1165
01:09:18,422 --> 01:09:20,724
- Alan?
- Mm-hm.

1166
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:24,861
Tell me something, and no jokes,
because it's too important.

1167
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:30,734
Why do you take out other girls?

1168
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,875
You know very well why.

1169
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:42,512
Well, tell me again.

1170
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:46,783
It's because I'm only human.

1171
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:50,487
And it's because I've been
seeing you for six months.

1172
01:09:50,587 --> 01:09:56,192
And, well, I've had to give up
certain things and make
sacrifices

1173
01:09:56,293 --> 01:09:59,095
that are against
the very nature of man.

1174
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,799
- You mean...
 - You know very well
 what I mean.

1175
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:09,839
All right then, Alan.
 Let's have the truth.

1176
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:13,109
Either you've said to yourself,
"I'm going to marry this girl,"

1177
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,744
or "I'm going to have
 an affair with her."

1178
01:10:14,844 --> 01:10:17,647
All I ask is that you let me in
on your decision.

1179
01:10:17,747 --> 01:10:20,317
I mean, if marriage is out,
 just say so.

1180
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:22,218
And we'll get on
with the affair.

1181
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:24,988
But, if you're in love with me,

1182
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:27,457
as I am with you,

1183
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:29,125
you have to tell me

1184
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:32,696
and be prepared to back it up
 with the rest of your life.

1185
01:10:38,602 --> 01:10:40,737
Well, which is it to be, Alan?

1186
01:10:40,837 --> 01:10:46,576
Do we march down the aisle
 or up to your apartment?

1187
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:48,945
That's the lousiest thing
I ever heard.

1188
01:10:49,045 --> 01:10:50,614
What am I supposed to say?

1189
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:54,418
Well, Alan, say what
you really feel.

1190
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:56,320
Well, how can I?

1191
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:59,389
If I say "I want you",
I'm yours.

1192
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:02,191
If I say "I love you",
you're mine.

1193
01:11:02,292 --> 01:11:04,361
- It's that simple.
 - Oh, no.

1194
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:07,931
I'm not playing at this game.
This is more dangerous
than Russian Roulette.

1195
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,999
Driver, stop.

1196
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,139
It's just being honest
 with each other, Alan,

1197
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:17,774
but you don't want that.

1198
01:11:17,874 --> 01:11:19,576
You won't even be honest
with yourself.

1199
01:11:19,676 --> 01:11:21,511
Connie, wait a minute,
will you, please?

1200
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:23,513
- I want to talk to you. Connie!
- Taxi! Taxi!

1201
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:26,716
Now just a second.
 Now hold it a minute.

1202
01:11:26,816 --> 01:11:28,184
What's the big idea?

1203
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,286
I'd say you needed
 a chance to think.

1204
01:11:30,387 --> 01:11:32,121
No, I don't.

1205
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:33,523
You mean you've
 made up your mind?

1206
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:36,893
- I have.
 - Well?

1207
01:11:36,993 --> 01:11:39,363
- You'll go along with it?
 - To the letter.

1208
01:11:39,463 --> 01:11:42,766
OK. OK, then.

1209
01:11:42,866 --> 01:11:46,302
Let's march right up
to my apartment.

1210
01:11:46,403 --> 01:11:49,806
That's the lousiest thing
 I ever heard.

1211
01:11:51,341 --> 01:11:53,076
- Where are you going?
 - To my place.

1212
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:55,345
If I'm going to do business
 at your apartment,

1213
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:58,815
I might as well get
 the rest of my merchandise.
 Let's go, driver.

1214
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:06,590
[soft music plays]

1215
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:17,434
Mr. Macintosh,
 may I tell you something?

1216
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:22,305
I'm awfully glad your friend,
Alan, couldn't make it tonight.

1217
01:12:22,406 --> 01:12:24,608
- You are?
 - Uh-huh.

1218
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:26,610
[telephone rings]

1219
01:12:30,547 --> 01:12:32,882
Cool it, man, I'm coming.

1220
01:12:32,982 --> 01:12:35,084
I'm coming.

1221
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:38,988
All right, take it easy.

1222
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:41,324
I'll answer it.

1223
01:12:41,425 --> 01:12:43,560
Hello.

1224
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:46,295
Dad! Dad, where are you?

1225
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:47,664
Downstairs?!

1226
01:12:47,764 --> 01:12:50,166
No, don't come up.
 Don't come up.

1227
01:12:50,266 --> 01:12:51,501
Uh, there's nobody here.

1228
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:53,369
I mean, no, Alan's not here.

1229
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:55,271
[nervous chuckle] Uh, what?

1230
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:58,775
Well, look, supposing...
 supposing I come downstairs?

1231
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,044
What, Dad...

1232
01:13:01,144 --> 01:13:03,379
Dad? Dad?

1233
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,749
Oh, boy.

1234
01:13:07,617 --> 01:13:09,118
[Peggy] Is anything wrong?

1235
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,520
What? Oh, no.

1236
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,289
Uh, it's just someone
 I didn't want to see.

1237
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:14,691
Uh, a writer.

1238
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:17,461
A writer? It sounded like
it was your father.

1239
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:20,430
Oh, no. Dad's just a nickname!

1240
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:22,632
[nervous laugh]
 We call him "Dad".

1241
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:28,271
Like, like Ernest Hemingway
 they called "Papa". You know?

1242
01:13:28,371 --> 01:13:29,773
Dad... Ernest... Papa...

1243
01:13:29,873 --> 01:13:33,176
Well, anyway, uh,
 Dad's coming up now.

1244
01:13:33,276 --> 01:13:36,345
And, uh, we kind of have to talk
alone for a few minutes.

1245
01:13:36,446 --> 01:13:38,648
Uh, about some changes
 in the script.

1246
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:41,384
- Oh! I understand.
 - Sure.

1247
01:13:41,485 --> 01:13:44,020
Maybe I'll go down
 to my place for a bit.

1248
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,122
That's it!
Will you do that?

1249
01:13:46,222 --> 01:13:48,692
- Of course.
 - Oh.

1250
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:50,694
[exhales]

1251
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:52,328
Oh, no! Not that way!

1252
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:57,400
Not that way. You see, I don't
want him to know I'm auditioning

1253
01:13:57,501 --> 01:13:59,202
someone else for the part.

1254
01:13:59,302 --> 01:14:03,139
Because I think he has some
 other actress in mind already.

1255
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:06,543
Oh, I really appreciate that,
 Mr. Macintosh.

1256
01:14:06,643 --> 01:14:08,478
- Thanks an awful lot.
 - Sure.

1257
01:14:08,578 --> 01:14:10,346
I'll go out the back.
 I know the way.

1258
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,816
- OK.
 - Bye.

1259
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:14,684
Bye.

1260
01:14:15,351 --> 01:14:17,186
[door opens]

1261
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:18,922
[door closes]

1262
01:14:41,878 --> 01:14:44,147
[doorbell ringing repeatedly]

1263
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:00,096
Why, hi, Dad.

1264
01:15:00,797 --> 01:15:02,599
Uh, you all right, Dad?

1265
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:05,535
Is there anything wrong?

1266
01:15:07,737 --> 01:15:10,073
I really wasn't expecting
 you up tonight.

1267
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:14,377
I was gonna go home and
have a nice, long talk
with you tomorrow night.

1268
01:15:14,477 --> 01:15:18,615
I, uh, I even told Mom
 I'd come home for dinner.

1269
01:15:20,416 --> 01:15:22,886
Boy, you're really angry,
 aren't you, Dad?

1270
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:24,988
Me, angry?

1271
01:15:25,088 --> 01:15:26,355
Why should I be angry?

1272
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:27,991
About the letter.

1273
01:15:28,091 --> 01:15:29,759
What letter?

1274
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:32,395
This letter.
 The letter I wrote you.

1275
01:15:32,495 --> 01:15:34,764
Oh, no. You didn't write
this letter.

1276
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:37,366
Somebody I don't know wrote this
letter, not you.

1277
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:40,570
You, I know.
This person, I never met.

1278
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:43,406
Dad, don't you think
 we could wait till tomorrow
 night to talk about this?

1279
01:15:43,506 --> 01:15:46,209
I mean, you'll be calmer.
 We can talk better.

1280
01:15:46,309 --> 01:15:49,545
What's there to talk about? It's
signed, sealed and delivered.

1281
01:15:49,646 --> 01:15:52,015
[laughs] The Declaration
of Independence.

1282
01:15:52,115 --> 01:15:55,785
Dad, I really think
 you're too upset now
 to discuss this logically.

1283
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:59,055
Listen, I expected it. You hang
around your brother long enough,

1284
01:15:59,155 --> 01:16:00,556
it was bound to happen.

1285
01:16:00,657 --> 01:16:04,060
So, what's the wind up?

1286
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:07,396
My sister Gussie has two
grandchildren...

1287
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:09,032
...and I got
a bum and a letter!

1288
01:16:09,132 --> 01:16:11,334
Dad, look, this didn't
 suddenly happen.

1289
01:16:11,434 --> 01:16:14,437
Now, I've tried to explain to
 you many times how I felt.

1290
01:16:14,537 --> 01:16:16,072
But you'd never listen to me.

1291
01:16:16,172 --> 01:16:20,777
All right. I would like to
hear from your own lips, nicely,

1292
01:16:20,877 --> 01:16:24,413
why a young, single boy can't
live at home with his parents.

1293
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:26,382
- Young boy?!
 - Nicely.

1294
01:16:26,482 --> 01:16:28,584
- Dad, I'm 21!
 - You're 21?

1295
01:16:28,685 --> 01:16:30,153
You say it as if
 you don't believe me.

1296
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:32,488
- I was 21 last week!
 - Whatever you say.

1297
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:35,625
- What do you mean,
 "whatever I say"?!
 - Nicely!

1298
01:16:35,725 --> 01:16:38,327
OK, I say I was 21.

1299
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,797
Now that's old enough for a man
 to be out on his own.

1300
01:16:40,897 --> 01:16:42,932
When you were 21,
 you were out on your own.

1301
01:16:43,032 --> 01:16:46,535
- You were there?
 - No, I wasn't there.

1302
01:16:46,636 --> 01:16:48,504
You've told me yourself.

1303
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,606
Those days were altogether
different.

1304
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:53,710
I was working
when I was 11 years old.

1305
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,578
I never went to camp!

1306
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,981
What's camp got to do
 with all this?!

1307
01:16:58,081 --> 01:16:59,816
- I'll walk right out of here
 in a minute.
 - All right.

1308
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:03,186
OK, Dad, I don't mean to be
 disrespectful now, but

1309
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:07,791
well, your answers just never
 match my questions.

1310
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:10,093
That too, huh?

1311
01:17:10,193 --> 01:17:13,262
Now I don't talk fancy enough
for you, huh?

1312
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:15,965
- Dad.
 - Soon even the business won't
 be good enough for you.

1313
01:17:16,065 --> 01:17:18,134
Well, now that you mention it,
 I've been thinking about that
 too.

1314
01:17:18,234 --> 01:17:22,538
- Huh?
- Maybe the business isn't
the right field for me.

1315
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,674
Not the right field?!

1316
01:17:25,608 --> 01:17:27,210
I give the boy the biggest

1317
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:30,579
artificial fruit manufacturing
 house in the east,

1318
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,448
and he tells me
"not the right field"?!

1319
01:17:32,548 --> 01:17:35,018
- [laughs]
 - Dad, I don't know if I have
 any talent or not,

1320
01:17:35,118 --> 01:17:37,520
but I've always kind of toyed
with the idea of being a writer.

1321
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:38,988
A writer? What kind of a writer?

1322
01:17:39,088 --> 01:17:41,524
Letters? Letters you write
 beautifully.

1323
01:17:41,624 --> 01:17:43,927
I don't know who's gonna buy
 them, but they're terrific.

1324
01:17:44,027 --> 01:17:46,395
Dad, look, will you just forget
about the business for now?

1325
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,031
I'll stay and work for you, OK?

1326
01:17:48,131 --> 01:17:51,701
Now, look, Dad, all I want
 tonight is your blessing

1327
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:54,437
for me to live here with Alan.

1328
01:17:54,537 --> 01:17:56,372
You want my blessing?

1329
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,442
I'll tell you what I'll do.

1330
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:01,677
- What?
- We had a disagreement,

1331
01:18:01,778 --> 01:18:05,214
a dispute,
we'll arbitrate.

1332
01:18:05,314 --> 01:18:08,251
- OK.
 - I heard your side,
 you heard my side.

1333
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:11,921
If you want, we'll give it
 a six month trial period.

1334
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:14,557
Fairer than that I couldn't be.

1335
01:18:14,657 --> 01:18:16,793
Gee, I think that's
 very fair, Dad.

1336
01:18:16,893 --> 01:18:19,328
Oh, that's wonderful.
Six months is just fine!

1337
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:22,899
- Wonderful!
- Then it's settled. You'll come
home and live for six months.

1338
01:18:22,999 --> 01:18:25,234
Come home?! You don't want
to give me a trial period,

1339
01:18:25,334 --> 01:18:26,803
you don't want
to be fair to me at all!

1340
01:18:26,903 --> 01:18:28,371
Listen, don't you raise
 your voice to me!

1341
01:18:28,471 --> 01:18:30,940
You're not too big to get
a good slap across the face!

1342
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,076
- I'm sorry, Dad.
 - You're here one day.

1343
01:18:33,176 --> 01:18:36,079
When did you ever
 yell at me before?!

1344
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:40,817
Never, I guess.
Now that you mention it.

1345
01:18:40,917 --> 01:18:43,586
I've been some terrible father
 to you, haven't I?

1346
01:18:43,686 --> 01:18:45,154
Dad, no, you've been fine.

1347
01:18:45,254 --> 01:18:48,257
You've been wonderful.
That's not what I mean.

1348
01:18:48,357 --> 01:18:52,195
All I'm asking you to do
is meet me halfway.

1349
01:18:52,295 --> 01:18:54,931
- I'll let you know.
 - What do you mean
 you'll let me know?

1350
01:18:55,031 --> 01:18:58,234
We'll see. You're coming home
 for dinner tomorrow night,
 we'll see.

1351
01:18:58,334 --> 01:19:00,870
OK, wonderful, Dad. Great.
Thanks a lot.

1352
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:03,572
- Good night, now.
 - [Peggy] Hi.

1353
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:07,811
Ooh, pardon me. You said
 you'd just be a few minutes.

1354
01:19:07,911 --> 01:19:11,514
This is some busy little girl.

1355
01:19:11,614 --> 01:19:14,450
Oh, hi, Dad!

1356
01:19:17,854 --> 01:19:20,824
Ooh, excuse me.

1357
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:22,859
I'll just wait in there.

1358
01:19:22,959 --> 01:19:28,364
Ooh, I'm awfully sorry,
Mr. Macintosh.

1359
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:36,873
Macintosh?

1360
01:19:36,973 --> 01:19:38,808
Now even his name
isn't good enough?

1361
01:19:38,908 --> 01:19:40,476
- Dad, you don't understand.
 - Bum!

1362
01:19:40,576 --> 01:19:42,411
- Dad, if you'll just
 let me explain...
 - Bum!

1363
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:44,814
- Dad, I know I can
 straighten it...
 - Bum!

1364
01:19:44,914 --> 01:19:46,715
- ...all out if...
- Twenty-one years old,

1365
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:51,087
already you're a bigger bum
than your brother is and
you got 18 years to go!

1366
01:19:51,187 --> 01:19:54,623
Oh, Dad, now, listen.
 [stammering] I can
 explain everything...

1367
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:57,126
Ah! The other bum!

1368
01:19:57,226 --> 01:20:01,097
Come on in, bum,
 we're having a party!

1369
01:20:01,197 --> 01:20:03,799
What are you doing here, Dad?

1370
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,801
I was invited to dinner.

1371
01:20:05,902 --> 01:20:08,571
That's some cook
 you got in there.

1372
01:20:08,671 --> 01:20:10,806
What cook?
What's he talking about?

1373
01:20:10,907 --> 01:20:12,842
Uh, he means Peggy.

1374
01:20:12,942 --> 01:20:15,144
Oh, why don't you tell him
she's waiting for me?

1375
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:19,248
I don't need you to make up
 stories for this.
 I got Tennessee Williams.

1376
01:20:19,348 --> 01:20:21,184
[doorbell rings]

1377
01:20:22,785 --> 01:20:24,988
- [Alan] Eckman!
- Eckman?

1378
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:27,523
From Dallas?
The buyer's brother?

1379
01:20:29,092 --> 01:20:31,995
Eckman, from Dallas...

1380
01:20:32,095 --> 01:20:34,330
...the buyer's husband.

1381
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:40,870
- Mr. Eckman?
 - You left your sample case,
 Mr. Baker.

1382
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:42,638
I wanted to make sure
 you got it back.

1383
01:20:42,738 --> 01:20:44,340
- You're not gonna
make a scene, are you?
- Southern hospitality.

1384
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:46,075
- Don't make any scenes,
will ya?
- Let's see here.

1385
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:47,944
Everything is arranged, yes.

1386
01:20:48,044 --> 01:20:51,514
Here we have
your 822-B ripe banana.

1387
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:55,584
And let's see... Ah!

1388
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:58,521
Naval orange, 55-A.

1389
01:20:58,621 --> 01:21:00,023
[shatters]

1390
01:21:00,123 --> 01:21:04,560
And what's this?
 The 300-A seedless grapes.

1391
01:21:05,461 --> 01:21:06,562
[smashes with foot]

1392
01:21:06,662 --> 01:21:11,400
And your 82-W Pippin apple.

1393
01:21:14,737 --> 01:21:16,639
Ah, and your latest item,

1394
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:20,376
the 99 stemless purple plum.

1395
01:21:22,011 --> 01:21:23,579
[popping sound]

1396
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,950
Good day, gentlemen.

1397
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:34,090
Oh, by the way, Mr. Baker,

1398
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:38,127
if I ever catch you even near
 Neiman Marcus again,

1399
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:43,432
I'm gonna jump on you
 till your eyes bug out like
 a stomped-on toad frog.

1400
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,668
Good night, gentlemen.

1401
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:57,446
He was...
 He was just kind of clowning.

1402
01:21:57,546 --> 01:22:00,116
You know, he does this
 all the time.

1403
01:22:00,783 --> 01:22:02,785
Now, Dad...

1404
01:22:02,885 --> 01:22:04,954
If you give me a couple
of seconds, I can explain
what happened.

1405
01:22:05,054 --> 01:22:08,591
- Yeah, Alan can tell you, Dad.
It's, uh...
- Will you listen to me?

1406
01:22:08,691 --> 01:22:12,295
Dad, will you just hear him out,
for just a second, please?

1407
01:22:16,332 --> 01:22:20,069
May you and your brother
live and be well.

1408
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:24,507
God bless you
 all the luck in the world.

1409
01:22:24,607 --> 01:22:29,979
You should know
 nothing but happiness.

1410
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:42,458
If I ever speak
 to either one of you again...

1411
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:48,397
...my tongue should fall out!

1412
01:22:52,035 --> 01:22:53,702
Maybe he didn't mean it?

1413
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,039
[loud crashing]

1414
01:22:58,574 --> 01:23:00,543
He meant it.

1415
01:23:02,111 --> 01:23:03,479
So we're fired.

1416
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:07,050
Yeah, don't let it eat your
heart out, will ya?

1417
01:23:14,123 --> 01:23:16,625
Hey, Dad! Dad!

1418
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:25,968
Hey, Alan!

1419
01:23:26,069 --> 01:23:28,003
Connie.

1420
01:23:30,306 --> 01:23:34,243
What are you doing here?
What do you got in that bag?

1421
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,545
The rest of my merchandise.
 I'll see you upstairs.

1422
01:23:36,645 --> 01:23:38,781
Oh, no. Get back
in the car there.
What's the matter with you?

1423
01:23:38,881 --> 01:23:41,517
Why, Alan, I think this is
 wonderful service.

1424
01:23:41,617 --> 01:23:43,452
You don't even have to pick up.
We deliver.

1425
01:23:43,552 --> 01:23:47,456
- Now you stop that.
 You get back in there.
 - Oh, Alan, don't.

1426
01:23:52,328 --> 01:23:55,264
Now, look, dear, honest,
this whole thing's all wrong.

1427
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:57,200
I mean, I just can't
go through with it.

1428
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:59,168
I probably could
with somebody else,

1429
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:02,037
but I can't go through with it
 with you. It's different.

1430
01:24:02,138 --> 01:24:04,573
Careful, Alan.

1431
01:24:04,673 --> 01:24:05,941
You'll commit yourself.

1432
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,843
Well, I don't care.

1433
01:24:07,943 --> 01:24:10,546
You know I love you.

1434
01:24:10,646 --> 01:24:12,448
- You do?
 - Of course I do.

1435
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:13,882
If I turned down
an offer like this,

1436
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:16,085
I must be in love with you.

1437
01:24:16,185 --> 01:24:19,588
You do? You really do?

1438
01:24:20,089 --> 01:24:21,390
Oh, Alan!

1439
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:23,459
Oh, Alan, I want
 to get married now.

1440
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:25,494
I want to get married tonight.

1441
01:24:25,594 --> 01:24:27,496
Oh, wait a minute, baby,
not so fast, honey.

1442
01:24:27,596 --> 01:24:30,133
No, not too fast.
You see, a lot of things
have happened to me tonight.

1443
01:24:30,233 --> 01:24:32,868
For instance,
I just lost my job.

1444
01:24:32,968 --> 01:24:35,138
- I thought you worked
 for your father.
 - Well, I did,

1445
01:24:35,238 --> 01:24:39,275
but we've had a heck
of a recession and he just
let two of his sons go.

1446
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:43,279
Oh, well. You'll get
 another job.

1447
01:24:43,379 --> 01:24:47,650
Sweetheart, wait a minute.
Dear, there's my kid brother
I have to worry about.

1448
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:50,719
- Oh, your brother.
 - My brother.

1449
01:24:52,521 --> 01:24:56,425
And your sisters
 and your cousins?

1450
01:24:56,525 --> 01:24:59,228
And your girlfriends
by the dozens?

1451
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:01,864
Oh, now, Connie, please.

1452
01:25:01,964 --> 01:25:03,732
Out.

1453
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:05,234
What do you mean "out"?

1454
01:25:05,334 --> 01:25:07,303
- Look...
 - Out, Alan.

1455
01:25:07,403 --> 01:25:09,638
Wait a minute, until everything
is cleared up,

1456
01:25:09,738 --> 01:25:12,141
why can't we just go on with
things the way they've been?

1457
01:25:12,241 --> 01:25:15,244
It's over, Alan,
 you're just not ready.

1458
01:25:15,344 --> 01:25:17,580
Not for any kind
of relationship.

1459
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:21,317
And it's just possible
 you never will be.

1460
01:25:22,185 --> 01:25:24,019
And if you'll excuse me,

1461
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,021
I have some weeping to do.

1462
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:28,991
Sweetheart.

1463
01:25:29,091 --> 01:25:30,593
[engine starts]

1464
01:26:10,633 --> 01:26:12,100
[door opens]

1465
01:26:12,201 --> 01:26:15,003
Harry, is that you?

1466
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:16,739
[door slams]

1467
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:19,375
That's you.

1468
01:26:31,654 --> 01:26:35,791
Well, darling,
did you have a nice day?

1469
01:26:38,561 --> 01:26:42,164
I, I made you a lovely dinner.

1470
01:26:42,265 --> 01:26:44,199
Oh, no, no.

1471
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,734
That's for tomorrow.

1472
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:47,770
It's on the table. Come.

1473
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:49,905
Come, darling, and sit down.

1474
01:26:50,273 --> 01:26:51,807
Here.

1475
01:27:10,259 --> 01:27:11,627
Harry...

1476
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:14,563
You know, since Buddy left,
 three months already,

1477
01:27:14,663 --> 01:27:16,865
you haven't said
 a civil word to me.

1478
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:19,502
Not so much as
 a pleasant hello.

1479
01:27:19,602 --> 01:27:23,171
Well, today you're going
 to have to force yourself.

1480
01:27:23,272 --> 01:27:25,207
You know why?

1481
01:27:25,308 --> 01:27:28,444
It's our anniversary, 43 years.

1482
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:31,414
Forty-three years.

1483
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,282
Well...

1484
01:27:33,382 --> 01:27:35,718
...happy anniversary, darling.

1485
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:39,955
I wish you all the happiness
in the world.

1486
01:27:40,055 --> 01:27:42,190
Thank you.

1487
01:27:42,291 --> 01:27:44,126
I wish you what you wish me.

1488
01:27:44,226 --> 01:27:47,330
What did I do you should
say such a thing?

1489
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:49,298
All I did was wish you
what you wish me.

1490
01:27:49,398 --> 01:27:51,700
- But you know what I wish you.
- You bet I do!

1491
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,370
Harry, don't start.
 The neighbors.

1492
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:55,904
Leave it alone!

1493
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:58,006
The neighbors should hear
what a wife wishes her husband.

1494
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:01,410
What could I wish you, a man who
turns his back on two sons?

1495
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:04,212
Sons? What sons?
You never gave me sons,
you gave me bums!

1496
01:28:04,313 --> 01:28:05,548
Harry, don't say that again.

1497
01:28:05,648 --> 01:28:08,216
I will not listen
 to that anymore.

1498
01:28:08,317 --> 01:28:10,319
You won't? Then who will?
Maybe the neighbors?

1499
01:28:10,419 --> 01:28:12,187
- Harry, don't you dare!
- Huh?

1500
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:16,024
Harry... Harry.

1501
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:17,893
This is no life for us.

1502
01:28:17,993 --> 01:28:21,129
We don't know how to live
 without children.

1503
01:28:21,229 --> 01:28:25,701
We'll learn. We'll learn,
 Sophie. We'll travel.

1504
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:27,370
Faraway places.

1505
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:29,872
No, Harry, I won't.
 I can't.

1506
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:33,342
Not until everything is right
 between you and the boys.

1507
01:28:33,442 --> 01:28:35,310
- You won't go with me?
- No!

1508
01:28:35,411 --> 01:28:38,647
- Then I'll take a neighbor!
 - Harry!

1509
01:28:38,747 --> 01:28:40,949
- Neighbor!
 - Harry!

1510
01:28:41,049 --> 01:28:44,286
- [up-tempo music plays]
 - Three, four, cha-cha-cha.

1511
01:28:44,387 --> 01:28:46,389
Very good, cha-cha-cha.

1512
01:28:46,489 --> 01:28:48,391
To the right, cha-cha-cha.

1513
01:28:48,491 --> 01:28:50,526
And again, cha-cha-cha.

1514
01:28:50,626 --> 01:28:52,428
Here we go, cha-cha-cha.

1515
01:28:52,528 --> 01:28:54,329
Baby, cha-cha-cha.

1516
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:56,331
Hey, baby!

1517
01:28:56,432 --> 01:28:58,501
Hurry up.

1518
01:28:58,601 --> 01:29:00,536
Three, four, cha-cha-cha.

1519
01:29:00,636 --> 01:29:02,304
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

1520
01:29:02,405 --> 01:29:04,172
Very good, cha-cha-cha.

1521
01:29:04,272 --> 01:29:06,809
Tonight's the night,
 cha-cha-cha.

1522
01:29:09,311 --> 01:29:11,113
Hi, Alan.
 Cha-cha-cha.

1523
01:29:11,213 --> 01:29:12,815
How are you?
 Cha-cha-cha.

1524
01:29:12,915 --> 01:29:16,619
- One, two, cha-cha-cha.
- Anybody call me today?

1525
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:18,921
To the right, cha-cha-cha.

1526
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:20,255
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

1527
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,324
I said, did anybody
call me today?

1528
01:29:22,425 --> 01:29:25,227
Mr. Copeland and Mr. Sampler.
 Cha-cha-cha.

1529
01:29:25,327 --> 01:29:26,995
- One, two, cha-cha-cha.
- What did they say?

1530
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:29,031
Three, four, cha-cha-cha.

1531
01:29:29,131 --> 01:29:31,066
Five, six, cha-cha-cha.

1532
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:33,001
Poopie!

1533
01:29:36,739 --> 01:29:38,674
- [turns music off]
 - What's wrong?

1534
01:29:38,774 --> 01:29:41,243
I'd like to hear
one sentence without
the rhythm section in it.

1535
01:29:41,343 --> 01:29:43,378
- What did they say?
 - Who?

1536
01:29:43,479 --> 01:29:45,648
Copeland and Sampler.
 Cha-cha-cha.

1537
01:29:45,748 --> 01:29:47,850
Oh, nothing. They'll call back.

1538
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:49,852
- [turns music on]
- One, two, cha-cha-cha.

1539
01:29:49,952 --> 01:29:52,054
- [turns music off]
 - To the right...

1540
01:29:54,256 --> 01:29:56,592
All right, all right.

1541
01:29:59,762 --> 01:30:01,830
Well, what's the matter,
Al, baby?

1542
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:07,102
Oh, now it's Al, baby?
I'll tell you what's the matter.

1543
01:30:07,202 --> 01:30:10,439
It's a little annoying to have
to wait around for the dance to
end to get my messages.

1544
01:30:10,539 --> 01:30:13,241
[sighs] Boy,
 you're jumpy lately.

1545
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:14,877
What do you do all day
 anyway, now?

1546
01:30:14,977 --> 01:30:18,046
You're gone from ten till six.
 You come home bushed,

1547
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:21,984
and you keep getting these
 strange calls all day.

1548
01:30:22,084 --> 01:30:24,620
Hey, you got a job?

1549
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:27,122
No, I haven't got a job,
Buddy, baby.

1550
01:30:27,222 --> 01:30:33,361
All right, OK, you don't
 have to bite my head off.

1551
01:30:33,462 --> 01:30:37,900
Look, Alan, what are you
 just eating your heart out
 like this for now?

1552
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,703
Now, why don't you pick up
 that phone and call her?

1553
01:30:40,803 --> 01:30:42,771
- Call who?
- [sarcastic] Call who.

1554
01:30:42,871 --> 01:30:45,841
Connie. Listen,
I've seen you reach for
that phone 1,000 times,

1555
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:48,977
- you even talk about her
 in your sleep.
 - You're nutty.

1556
01:30:49,077 --> 01:30:50,813
- You need her, Alan.
- I don't need anybody.

1557
01:30:50,913 --> 01:30:54,517
All right, fine.
 I'm sorry I brought it up.

1558
01:31:03,859 --> 01:31:05,994
Listen, kid, why don't we, uh...

1559
01:31:06,094 --> 01:31:08,063
Why don't we go to a movie
 tonight, just you and me, huh?

1560
01:31:08,163 --> 01:31:10,599
Aw, gee, Al, I'd love to do
 that, I really would.

1561
01:31:10,699 --> 01:31:13,201
But, you see, I have a...
 I got a date tonight.

1562
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:17,806
And, uh, matter of fact, she's
 in the den right now changing.

1563
01:31:17,906 --> 01:31:20,609
- Changing?
- Ready or not.

1564
01:31:20,709 --> 01:31:24,880
Yeah, she came right here after
basketball practice.

1565
01:31:26,582 --> 01:31:27,883
Zip me up, would ya?

1566
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:29,652
Where are we going tonight?

1567
01:31:29,752 --> 01:31:31,554
Well, first we'll
 go out to dinner,

1568
01:31:31,654 --> 01:31:33,288
and, uh, then we'll go dancing,

1569
01:31:33,388 --> 01:31:37,760
and, uh, maybe we'll come back
 here and shoot a few baskets.

1570
01:31:40,462 --> 01:31:44,232
That is if a certain party will
cooperate with us a little bit

1571
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:47,335
by going out to a late movie?

1572
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:49,004
What do you say,
certain party?

1573
01:31:49,104 --> 01:31:51,974
[Alan] Boy, I'm beginning to
 feel like I'm 80 years old.

1574
01:31:52,074 --> 01:31:54,276
Let me tell you something,
 Al baby,

1575
01:31:54,376 --> 01:31:58,513
that's about ten years younger
 than you're beginning to act.

1576
01:31:58,614 --> 01:32:00,616
Get a hold of yourself, fella.

1577
01:32:04,386 --> 01:32:06,722
See you later, Al.

1578
01:32:06,822 --> 01:32:08,691
- [woman] Who was that?
- [Buddy] My brother.

1579
01:32:08,791 --> 01:32:10,826
He shares the apartment with me.

1580
01:32:15,764 --> 01:32:18,834
- Hiya, Mr. Baker.
 - Hi, Willie. Oh, say, Willie?

1581
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:21,704
I didn't get my
blue mohair suit this morning.

1582
01:32:21,804 --> 01:32:23,371
You promised to
give it to me today.

1583
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:24,940
Sure, sure, Mr. Baker,

1584
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,676
but then your brother comes
 in with that rush order.

1585
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,511
"Hold the presses" he says.

1586
01:32:29,612 --> 01:32:34,549
- I figured he's your brother...
- OK, Willie.
Thank you very much.

1587
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:44,092
Maxie, here's a dime
for the local.

1588
01:32:44,192 --> 01:32:47,495
Get me down for five
on Raza Daza and Highly
in the fifth.

1589
01:32:47,596 --> 01:32:49,665
Sorry, Mr. Baker,
 I filled the book.

1590
01:32:49,765 --> 01:32:53,235
Your brother took the last
 ten spot a few minutes ago.

1591
01:33:01,944 --> 01:33:04,613
- Hi, Rudy.
- Hi, Mr. Baker.

1592
01:33:04,713 --> 01:33:08,617
- You almost finished?
 - Not quite.

1593
01:33:08,717 --> 01:33:10,352
Won't be long though, will it?

1594
01:33:10,452 --> 01:33:13,355
Well, I just started.

1595
01:33:13,455 --> 01:33:16,759
I've had a standing appointment
here for every week for nine
years,

1596
01:33:16,859 --> 01:33:18,360
I haven't missed one yet.

1597
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:20,162
It's, uh, my fault, Alan.

1598
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:21,630
Hiya, pal.

1599
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:23,699
This is the last straw.

1600
01:33:23,799 --> 01:33:27,970
- I mean, the last straw.
 - Look, Alan, I didn't think
 you'd be in today.

1601
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:31,206
- Hey, buff 'em up good there,
 sweetie.
 - I'm sorry, Mr. Baker.

1602
01:33:31,306 --> 01:33:34,576
Look, Alan, Pete's not in right
now, but he'll be back in a
couple minutes, though.

1603
01:33:34,677 --> 01:33:36,278
He's a good barber,
 why don't you try him?

1604
01:33:36,378 --> 01:33:37,746
I didn't come here for Pete.

1605
01:33:37,846 --> 01:33:41,149
Well, you want Rudy?
 You want my barber?

1606
01:33:41,249 --> 01:33:43,485
Your barber?

1607
01:33:43,585 --> 01:33:46,989
Your barber?!
I brought you here!

1608
01:33:47,089 --> 01:33:49,324
He's my barber!

1609
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:53,662
The whole world
 doesn't have to know.

1610
01:33:53,762 --> 01:33:55,898
Atta girl, sweetie.
 You tell him, babe.

1611
01:33:55,998 --> 01:34:00,035
[chuckles] Hey, Rudy, make sure
you sneak up on those sideburns
nice and easy, will ya?

1612
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:02,705
Uh, Alan, you were saying?

1613
01:34:02,805 --> 01:34:05,507
I take him in,
I teach him how to walk,

1614
01:34:05,607 --> 01:34:07,642
how to dress,
 how to talk even,

1615
01:34:07,743 --> 01:34:09,912
now look at him.
 He uses my barber,

1616
01:34:10,012 --> 01:34:12,180
my manicurist, my shoeshine man,
my bookmaker,

1617
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:15,784
- my apartment, even!
- Look, Alan, I thought we were
splitting everything 50-50.

1618
01:34:15,884 --> 01:34:18,086
We were, is true.
But it's over now.

1619
01:34:18,186 --> 01:34:20,288
- OK, all right.
 - And another thing,

1620
01:34:20,388 --> 01:34:23,525
you'd better start giving
some thought about buying
your own food.

1621
01:34:23,625 --> 01:34:27,662
I'm sick and tired of bringing
 the cookies home and watching
 you finish them.

1622
01:34:27,763 --> 01:34:30,699
While you look at my television,
read my magazines,

1623
01:34:30,799 --> 01:34:33,135
and get the crumbs
 all over my chair!

1624
01:34:33,235 --> 01:34:35,838
- You must be kidding.
 - The heck I am!

1625
01:34:35,938 --> 01:34:39,174
And keep your hands
 off my Fig Newtons.

1626
01:34:39,274 --> 01:34:40,943
[telephone rings]

1627
01:34:43,879 --> 01:34:45,981
Yeah? Yes, he's here.

1628
01:34:46,081 --> 01:34:49,918
Mr. Baker, it's for you.
No, the young one.

1629
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:54,422
- Ooh.
 - Just a minute.
 I'm not through with you yet.

1630
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:56,792
Hello? Oh, hi Mr. Sardi.

1631
01:34:56,892 --> 01:34:59,862
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
 I did call you. It seems
 that your head waiter

1632
01:34:59,962 --> 01:35:02,931
couldn't find me a spot
 for a luncheon reservation.

1633
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:05,567
Uh-huh. Well,
 I thought maybe you could.

1634
01:35:05,667 --> 01:35:08,136
Well, it's, uh, Macintosh.

1635
01:35:08,236 --> 01:35:11,907
And if you can't find it there,
look under Paramount Pictures.

1636
01:35:12,007 --> 01:35:17,345
Wonderful, thank you so much.
 I'm sure it was just
 a misunderstanding.

1637
01:35:17,445 --> 01:35:19,281
Uh-huh. Good-bye.

1638
01:35:20,382 --> 01:35:22,650
Now, look, Alan,
just get off my back, huh?

1639
01:35:22,751 --> 01:35:24,419
It's really not very pleasant,
 you know.

1640
01:35:24,519 --> 01:35:28,623
How about that? That guy thought
I was really from Paramount.

1641
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:31,226
So did I.

1642
01:35:34,129 --> 01:35:35,998
[band playing jazz music]

1643
01:35:36,098 --> 01:35:38,500
[people chattering]

1644
01:35:42,204 --> 01:35:50,278
B-U-I-L-D.

1645
01:35:50,378 --> 01:35:53,982
Five letters.

1646
01:35:55,450 --> 01:36:01,790
One, two, three, four...

1647
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:06,929
...five.

1648
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:08,864
What are they playing?

1649
01:36:08,964 --> 01:36:10,598
Strip Scrabble.

1650
01:36:10,698 --> 01:36:13,201
[indistinct chatter]

1651
01:36:16,704 --> 01:36:21,944
Golly, Mr. Macintosh, you have
 such intellectual friends.

1652
01:36:22,044 --> 01:36:26,915
I mean, well, I've never been
to a party with so many brains.

1653
01:36:27,015 --> 01:36:30,485
Yeah, well, that's the way it is
with us people in the arts.

1654
01:36:30,585 --> 01:36:32,888
You're in a deep sleep.

1655
01:36:32,988 --> 01:36:36,058
On the count of three,
you will awaken from that sleep

1656
01:36:36,158 --> 01:36:39,527
and you will think that you are
United States Senators.

1657
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:44,599
You, Mildred,
will look everywhere
for President Kennedy.

1658
01:36:44,699 --> 01:36:49,271
Ready now? One, two, three.

1659
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:00,315
[woman laughing]

1660
01:37:15,864 --> 01:37:18,400
Hi. I understand
you're the sculptor.

1661
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:22,570
Yes, and a very exciting one,
I might immodestly say.

1662
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:25,307
Oh, I, I just adore sculptors.

1663
01:37:25,407 --> 01:37:28,543
Do you? I work in very
 unusual materials.

1664
01:37:28,643 --> 01:37:31,479
I've done some lovely small
 heads in soap.

1665
01:37:31,579 --> 01:37:35,583
And lately, I've had a lot of
luck in cream cheese.

1666
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:37,285
Really?!

1667
01:37:41,223 --> 01:37:45,493
[man] T-H-Y-R-O-I-D.
Thyroid, seven letters.

1668
01:37:45,593 --> 01:37:51,900
[woman] One, two, three, four...

1669
01:38:00,008 --> 01:38:01,509
Ah! There you are.

1670
01:38:01,609 --> 01:38:04,712
You with your promises
of federal aid to education.

1671
01:38:04,812 --> 01:38:07,215
Promises, that's all they were.

1672
01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:09,985
She thinks you're
President Kennedy.

1673
01:38:10,085 --> 01:38:13,989
Make her happy.
Say something to assure her.

1674
01:38:14,089 --> 01:38:19,127
I'll try to push the bill
 through before the close
 of the next session.

1675
01:38:21,196 --> 01:38:24,299
- Hey, Peg.
- Oh, hi, Alan!

1676
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:26,168
Isn't this a marvy party?

1677
01:38:26,268 --> 01:38:29,304
Yeah, say, have you seen Buddy?
I mean, my buddy Macintosh?

1678
01:38:29,404 --> 01:38:32,074
Oh, uh, he's around here
someplace.

1679
01:38:32,174 --> 01:38:35,877
Alan, I'd like you to meet
 Wilton Harkute.

1680
01:38:35,978 --> 01:38:38,113
He's a poet.

1681
01:38:38,213 --> 01:38:42,084
Actually, we were just leaving
 because Wilton's gonna take me
 to his apartment

1682
01:38:42,184 --> 01:38:44,786
to meet his roommate,
 Carl Sandburg.

1683
01:38:44,886 --> 01:38:49,157
Well, come on, Bye!

1684
01:38:50,558 --> 01:38:54,429
Sandburg. That's a better line
 than Macintosh.

1685
01:39:04,472 --> 01:39:08,110
Wait, Eunice, where you going?
 I love you.

1686
01:39:08,210 --> 01:39:10,012
Where are you going and
what's with all the love talk?

1687
01:39:10,112 --> 01:39:11,446
What's with this eavesdropping?

1688
01:39:11,546 --> 01:39:13,615
- I gotta talk to you, kid.
 - Not now, Alan.

1689
01:39:13,715 --> 01:39:15,483
Buddy?

1690
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:25,093
- Eunice? Eunice?
 - She's in there.

1691
01:39:27,162 --> 01:39:28,763
Now, listen...

1692
01:39:28,863 --> 01:39:32,934
- Hey, pal?
 - I was just looking
 for some cream cheese.

1693
01:39:33,035 --> 01:39:35,703
Try Wisconsin,
 it's the dairy state.

1694
01:39:38,606 --> 01:39:41,143
I don't like what's
 happening to you, kid.

1695
01:39:42,210 --> 01:39:44,046
Why, you shouldn't talk
that way, big brother.

1696
01:39:44,146 --> 01:39:46,448
Everything I know,
 I learned from you.

1697
01:39:47,449 --> 01:39:48,916
You're the one
that told me to, uh,

1698
01:39:49,017 --> 01:39:50,585
take a bite out of
 the real fruit of life.

1699
01:39:50,685 --> 01:39:53,055
The one that told me to go out
 and have some real fun

1700
01:39:53,155 --> 01:39:55,090
- for a change.
- That's right. I said have fun.

1701
01:39:55,190 --> 01:39:59,594
But I didn't say anything about
all night parties and drinking
all night.

1702
01:39:59,694 --> 01:40:02,797
- Oh, come off it, Alan.
 - I won't have it, Buddy.

1703
01:40:02,897 --> 01:40:05,233
I won't have my kid brother
 carrying on like this.

1704
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:07,102
- Like what?
 - Like a bum!

1705
01:40:07,202 --> 01:40:09,304
- A bum?!
 - A bum!

1706
01:40:09,404 --> 01:40:12,907
Just take a look at that crowd
 you're running around with.

1707
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:15,810
Intellectual delinquents.

1708
01:40:15,910 --> 01:40:18,080
Strip Scrabble players.

1709
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:19,847
Amateur hypnotists.

1710
01:40:19,947 --> 01:40:24,086
And another thing, where were
 you until 4:00 this morning?

1711
01:40:24,186 --> 01:40:28,990
- What?!
 - I wanna know where you were
 until 4:00 this morning.

1712
01:40:29,091 --> 01:40:31,926
Oh! Cock-a-doodle-doo!

1713
01:40:32,026 --> 01:40:34,462
What's with you?!

1714
01:40:42,237 --> 01:40:44,106
Don't you cock-a-doodle me,
 young man.

1715
01:40:44,206 --> 01:40:46,141
You're not too big to get a good
slap across the face.

1716
01:40:46,241 --> 01:40:49,244
Cock-a-doodle-do.
 Now I've got two fathers.

1717
01:40:49,344 --> 01:40:52,647
Stop that. I'm nothing like him.

1718
01:40:52,747 --> 01:40:55,650
I'm seeing you
 for the first time.

1719
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:57,819
[crows]

1720
01:40:57,919 --> 01:40:59,754
[music, chatter stops]

1721
01:41:06,828 --> 01:41:09,797
I'm sorry, kid, honest I am.

1722
01:41:11,699 --> 01:41:15,036
You're seeing yourself
 for the first time, Alan.

1723
01:41:15,137 --> 01:41:17,472
I'm just a carbon copy.

1724
01:41:18,673 --> 01:41:22,577
You're bugged 'cause
 you don't belong here.

1725
01:41:22,677 --> 01:41:24,712
Well, I do.

1726
01:41:25,813 --> 01:41:28,883
I'm just starting
 my fling, Alan.

1727
01:41:28,983 --> 01:41:31,686
You're flung.

1728
01:41:40,795 --> 01:41:43,431
Good-bye, Mr. President.

1729
01:41:48,836 --> 01:41:50,605
[tires squeal]

1730
01:42:02,984 --> 01:42:06,087
Operator, this is KJ12121.

1731
01:42:06,188 --> 01:42:09,257
Could you get me
Trafalgar 46598, please?

1732
01:42:09,357 --> 01:42:10,758
Thank you.

1733
01:42:10,858 --> 01:42:13,395
[telephone rings]

1734
01:42:23,104 --> 01:42:27,342
- Hello?
- Connie, this is Alan.

1735
01:42:27,442 --> 01:42:30,812
- Alan who?
- The Alan who loves
and adores you.

1736
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:33,781
[yawns] Oh, that Alan.

1737
01:42:36,651 --> 01:42:38,152
That Alan?!

1738
01:42:38,253 --> 01:42:42,757
Oh! Oh, Alan!

1739
01:42:42,857 --> 01:42:45,360
Alan, you called!

1740
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:47,829
I was beginning to give up hope.

1741
01:42:47,929 --> 01:42:49,831
Alan, I love you.

1742
01:42:49,931 --> 01:42:51,833
And I missed you!

1743
01:42:51,933 --> 01:42:54,802
- Where are you? 
 - I'm in Bermuda.

1744
01:42:54,902 --> 01:42:58,340
Bermuda? What are you 
 doing in Bermuda?

1745
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:00,475
I came down here
 to do some thinking.

1746
01:43:00,575 --> 01:43:04,279
And you know what?
 I've decided I want
 to marry you.

1747
01:43:05,447 --> 01:43:08,316
Oh, Alan! Oh, Alan!

1748
01:43:08,416 --> 01:43:12,186
Oh, darling, darling!

1749
01:43:12,287 --> 01:43:14,456
Oh, I waited so long for this!

1750
01:43:14,556 --> 01:43:17,225
Oh, Alan, how soon
 can you come home?

1751
01:43:17,325 --> 01:43:20,528
Oh, about two days.

1752
01:43:20,628 --> 01:43:23,298
Well, why must it take two days?

1753
01:43:23,398 --> 01:43:24,432
Can't you fly?

1754
01:43:24,532 --> 01:43:26,734
What did you say?

1755
01:43:26,834 --> 01:43:28,570
I said take a plane.

1756
01:43:28,670 --> 01:43:32,006
Oh, darling. Darling, darling!

1757
01:43:32,106 --> 01:43:34,742
- What?
 - Oh, Alan.

1758
01:43:34,842 --> 01:43:36,578
I can't hear you,
there's too much noise.

1759
01:43:36,678 --> 01:43:39,947
Alan! Oh, Alan!
 For heaven's sake!

1760
01:43:40,047 --> 01:43:40,948
Just a second.

1761
01:43:41,048 --> 01:43:42,450
Alan, what noise?

1762
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:44,719
I don't hear any noise. 
 Alan?

1763
01:43:44,819 --> 01:43:47,822
Alan, talk to me! 
 I can't hear you.

1764
01:43:47,922 --> 01:43:49,991
Alan...

1765
01:43:53,628 --> 01:43:55,263
Alan, never mind the noise.

1766
01:43:55,363 --> 01:43:57,432
- Alan?
 - [knocking at door]

1767
01:43:57,532 --> 01:43:59,967
- Who is it?
 - [Alan in deep voice]
 Telegram, ma'am.

1768
01:44:00,067 --> 01:44:02,637
Oh, um, just a moment.
 Alan?

1769
01:44:02,737 --> 01:44:06,073
Alan, Alan? Oh, for heaven's
 sakes. Just a moment, please.

1770
01:44:06,173 --> 01:44:07,909
Don't go away.

1771
01:44:08,009 --> 01:44:10,378
Telegram, ma'am.

1772
01:44:10,478 --> 01:44:12,680
Oh, put it on the table.

1773
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:14,349
Alan?

1774
01:44:50,518 --> 01:44:52,620
- Alan! Hey, where you been?
- Hi, kid.

1775
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:55,890
I've been really worried about
 you. I was gonna apologize for
 the other night, Alan.

1776
01:44:55,990 --> 01:44:59,927
- It was really my fault.
 - It's all right, you did me
 a great big favor.

1777
01:45:00,562 --> 01:45:01,696
Where you been?

1778
01:45:01,796 --> 01:45:04,699
That's the favor.
You drove me to it.

1779
01:45:04,799 --> 01:45:07,369
- No! No! You didn't do that!
 - Yep.

1780
01:45:07,469 --> 01:45:09,270
- Not you! Really?
 - Yep, I did it.

1781
01:45:09,371 --> 01:45:12,640
- I don't know what to say! Gee.
- [Sophie humming]

1782
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:15,076
- Oh, Alan.
 - Mom.

1783
01:45:15,176 --> 01:45:17,545
- Hello, darling.
 - What are you doing here?

1784
01:45:17,645 --> 01:45:19,681
She moved in this morning,
 for keeps.

1785
01:45:19,781 --> 01:45:22,049
I'm like him,
I've run away from home.

1786
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:24,686
- She's kidding, of course.
 - No, she's not kidding.

1787
01:45:24,786 --> 01:45:26,688
- She's dead serious.
 - What happened?

1788
01:45:26,788 --> 01:45:29,223
What happened?
 Ask America what happened.

1789
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:34,629
In Alaska they must've
 heard how that man has
 been carrying on with me.

1790
01:45:34,729 --> 01:45:38,199
Yeah, I know, he's been pretty
 upset, Mom. But everything's
 gonna be all right now.

1791
01:45:38,299 --> 01:45:39,867
- Yeah?
- Right, Buddy?

1792
01:45:39,967 --> 01:45:42,670
- You shouldn't hold
 your breath.
 - [doorbell rings]

1793
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:45,640
- That'll be Connie.
- I'll go clean the den.

1794
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:49,477
- OK.
- Twenty years nobody's
been in there to clean.

1795
01:45:50,111 --> 01:45:51,278
Dad.

1796
01:45:51,379 --> 01:45:53,147
Where is she?

1797
01:45:53,247 --> 01:45:55,683
I know she's in here.

1798
01:45:56,484 --> 01:45:58,853
Where is their mother?

1799
01:45:58,953 --> 01:46:00,822
She's in the den.

1800
01:46:00,922 --> 01:46:04,626
Now they're hiding them
in the den?

1801
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,229
Very nice!

1802
01:46:08,329 --> 01:46:10,097
Very nice for a mother!

1803
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:14,402
- [Sophie] What do you want?
 - What is she doing here?

1804
01:46:14,502 --> 01:46:16,571
Where else should she be?

1805
01:46:16,671 --> 01:46:18,673
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

1806
01:46:18,773 --> 01:46:22,043
This is something I will not
 discuss in front of strangers.

1807
01:46:22,143 --> 01:46:23,545
They are your sons.

1808
01:46:23,645 --> 01:46:27,515
They are your sons.
 They are my strangers.

1809
01:46:28,082 --> 01:46:29,884
Is she coming home?!

1810
01:46:29,984 --> 01:46:32,420
She is home.

1811
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:34,956
This is where she lives now.

1812
01:46:37,459 --> 01:46:39,727
This is where she lives?

1813
01:46:39,827 --> 01:46:43,097
- With bums?!
 - That's right,
 so that makes me a bum too.

1814
01:46:43,197 --> 01:46:46,601
Are you happy now?
 Now you've got three bums.

1815
01:46:46,701 --> 01:46:50,171
- Can I say something, Dad?
 - Who's he talking to?
 I'm not even here.

1816
01:46:50,271 --> 01:46:53,407
- Dad, can I say something?
 - Write it in a play,
 I'll see it opening night.

1817
01:46:53,508 --> 01:46:56,878
Will you calm down for two
seconds? There's something very
important I have to tell you.

1818
01:46:56,978 --> 01:46:59,180
Is she coming with me or do I go
alone around the world?

1819
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,483
- Around the world?
 - Are you gonna make a trip
 around the world?

1820
01:47:01,583 --> 01:47:03,785
Look, look who's
 suddenly so shocked!

1821
01:47:03,885 --> 01:47:06,488
The skier,
 the Pulitzer Prize winner.

1822
01:47:06,588 --> 01:47:10,057
- Would you listen to me,
 please?
 - I don't wanna hear any more.

1823
01:47:11,859 --> 01:47:14,496
If the woman wants,
 she can meet me in Hong Kong.

1824
01:47:14,596 --> 01:47:19,433
- Look, Dad, please.
 - Pushing a father?
 You're pushing?

1825
01:47:19,534 --> 01:47:22,003
- [Buddy] I'm sorry, Dad.
 - Alan?

1826
01:47:22,103 --> 01:47:24,338
Sweetheart, come on in.

1827
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:26,874
I want you to meet my mother,
my father and my kid brother.

1828
01:47:26,974 --> 01:47:29,376
- This is Connie.
 - How do you do?

1829
01:47:29,477 --> 01:47:32,046
- Are you gonna stay here or
 are you gonna come with me?
 - Dad.

1830
01:47:32,146 --> 01:47:34,982
- Oh, come on, Dad,
Alan has something to tell you.
- Again he's pushing?

1831
01:47:35,082 --> 01:47:37,485
- Harry, let the boy talk.
 - [telephone rings]

1832
01:47:37,585 --> 01:47:40,522
- Oh, Alan, the phone.
 - Alan, perhaps
 I'd better come back?

1833
01:47:40,622 --> 01:47:43,024
- You wait right where you are.
- Buddy, the phone.

1834
01:47:43,124 --> 01:47:46,327
- Dad, there's something
 I must tell you.
 - Will you just let him talk?

1835
01:47:46,427 --> 01:47:48,496
If he pushes me once more, I...

1836
01:47:48,596 --> 01:47:50,565
Maybe I'm crazy,
 nobody hears a phone?

1837
01:47:50,665 --> 01:47:53,568
Will you all please
 be quiet for five seconds?

1838
01:47:53,668 --> 01:47:57,438
There's something I'd like...
 It isn't often a son can make
 an announcement like this.

1839
01:47:57,539 --> 01:47:59,841
Oh, this I can't stand already.

1840
01:47:59,941 --> 01:48:02,043
- Alan, perhaps I...
 - Pop!

1841
01:48:02,143 --> 01:48:05,613
- It's very important that you
 listen to what I have to say!
 - Hello?

1842
01:48:05,713 --> 01:48:07,248
- I'm not here.
- Hello?!

1843
01:48:07,348 --> 01:48:10,117
- Oh, Alan, it's for you.
 - Take a message, Mom, please.

1844
01:48:10,217 --> 01:48:12,987
Again with the message.
Where's the paper now?

1845
01:48:13,087 --> 01:48:15,757
No, you stay right...
 Mom, I'll get it.

1846
01:48:17,458 --> 01:48:20,762
Hello? Oh, Mr. Copeland,
how are you, sir?

1847
01:48:20,862 --> 01:48:24,231
Fine. Oh, that's wonderful.

1848
01:48:24,331 --> 01:48:26,300
The same order
we discussed at lunch.

1849
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,603
That's fine.
Thank you very much.
Have a good trip back home.

1850
01:48:28,703 --> 01:48:34,208
- Bye-bye.
 - How does he come to know
 Copeland of Milwaukee?

1851
01:48:34,308 --> 01:48:37,712
I'd heard he was in town,
so I took him to lunch
a few times last week.

1852
01:48:37,812 --> 01:48:41,282
Five years I'm after
 Copeland of Milwaukee.

1853
01:48:41,382 --> 01:48:43,184
I thought I owed you
that much, Dad.

1854
01:48:43,284 --> 01:48:44,752
You don't owe me anything.

1855
01:48:44,852 --> 01:48:47,722
- I don't wanna be owed
anything by a bum!
- Ha!

1856
01:48:47,822 --> 01:48:49,557
- Why am I a bum?
 - Are you married?

1857
01:48:49,657 --> 01:48:51,926
- Yes!
 - Then you're a bu... What?

1858
01:48:52,026 --> 01:48:55,930
- What?
- This is your daughter-in-law.
We were married last night.

1859
01:48:56,030 --> 01:48:58,900
- No! Well, Connie!
 - Yes.

1860
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,935
- Darling!
- That's what I've been
trying to say.

1861
01:49:01,035 --> 01:49:03,337
- I've been trying to tell ya.
 - Why didn't you say so, baby?

1862
01:49:03,437 --> 01:49:04,806
Darling! Look at that!

1863
01:49:04,906 --> 01:49:08,242
[overlapping chatter]

1864
01:49:08,342 --> 01:49:12,146
Harry, your son is married.

1865
01:49:14,649 --> 01:49:16,651
Nobody tells me anything.

1866
01:49:16,751 --> 01:49:19,754
All I get is pushed.

1867
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:49,016
Now listen,

1868
01:49:49,116 --> 01:49:51,052
how about we go out and
we have a bottle of champagne

1869
01:49:51,152 --> 01:49:53,621
and a nice brunch to celebrate
 the wedding, huh?

1870
01:49:53,721 --> 01:49:54,922
What do you say?

1871
01:49:55,022 --> 01:49:56,824
Yes, why don't we, Mr. Baker?

1872
01:49:56,924 --> 01:49:59,393
We can all be together and
have a nice, long talk.

1873
01:49:59,493 --> 01:50:01,696
Just the family, all right?

1874
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,435
- Well...
- Come on, Mom.

1875
01:50:08,535 --> 01:50:12,306
- Maybe just a cup of coffee.
 - Yes, that's all, Mr. Baker.

1876
01:50:12,406 --> 01:50:14,909
[all chattering]

1877
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:23,785
Come, come, come, come, come!

1878
01:50:23,885 --> 01:50:25,920
You're lagging,
we're gonna bust the wine.

1879
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:27,554
Well, I was just thinking, Alan.

1880
01:50:27,655 --> 01:50:28,856
After all, you're married now.

1881
01:50:28,956 --> 01:50:30,291
And a place like this...

1882
01:50:30,391 --> 01:50:32,660
Save your breath, I know what
you're trying to say.

1883
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:34,028
But you can have it,
it's all yours.

1884
01:50:34,128 --> 01:50:35,730
Really?!
 You mean it? You mean it?

1885
01:50:35,830 --> 01:50:38,299
Your brother you're pushing?

1886
01:50:38,399 --> 01:50:40,334
[telephone ringing]

1887
01:50:41,202 --> 01:50:43,805
Hello. Julia?

1888
01:50:43,905 --> 01:50:45,807
Uh, yeah, just a minute.

1889
01:50:45,907 --> 01:50:48,509
It's for you.
 Who's Julia?

1890
01:50:48,609 --> 01:50:50,011
That'll be Julia Merritt.

1891
01:50:50,111 --> 01:50:52,680
Remember once you asked me
how I could afford this place?

1892
01:50:52,780 --> 01:50:54,348
Well, I really never could.

1893
01:50:54,448 --> 01:50:56,383
See, I leased it from her.

1894
01:50:56,483 --> 01:50:59,821
- So?
- So, if she likes you,

1895
01:50:59,921 --> 01:51:02,757
she practically gives it away.

1896
01:51:05,927 --> 01:51:09,596
Hello, Julia?
 This is Alan's brother, Buddy.

1897
01:51:09,697 --> 01:51:14,601
Hey, uh, don't you know you
 could get arrested for having
 such a sexy voice?

1898
01:51:14,702 --> 01:51:17,304
[laughs]
