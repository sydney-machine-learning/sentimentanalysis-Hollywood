00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,741
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree</i>

2
00:01:56,742 --> 00:02:01,037
<i>A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be</i>

3
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,749
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo</i>

4
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,003
<i>Good luck will rub off when
he shakes hands with you</i>

5
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:14,361
<i>Chim chiminy chim chim cheree
Chim cheroo</i>

6
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,414
All right, ladies and gents.

7
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,041
Comical poems suitable
for the occasion,

8
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,837
extemporised and thought
up before your very eyes.

9
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,089
All right, here we go.

10
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,968
<i>Room here for everyone
Gather around</i>

11
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,345
The constable's responstable.

12
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,722
Now, how does that sound?

13
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,870
Hmm...

14
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:51,757
<i>Hello, Miss Lark
I got one for you</i>

15
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,735
Miss Lark likes to
walk in the park...

16
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,338
- Grrrr.
- ...with Andrew!

17
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,863
Arf! Arf!

18
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:02,719
- Hello, Andrew.
- Arf! Arf! Grrrr! Grrrr!

19
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,994
<i>Ah, Mrs Cory</i>

20
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:08,080
<i>A story for you</i>

21
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,499
Your daughters were
shorter than you,

22
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,149
but they grew.

23
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,287
<i>Dear Miss Persimmon...</i>

24
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,665
Yes?

25
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,290
<i>Wind's in the east</i>

26
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,980
<i>Mist comin' in</i>

27
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,691
<i>Like something is brewin'</i>

28
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,716
<i>About to begin</i>

29
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:44,142
<i>Can't put me finger
on what lies in store</i>

30
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,912
<i>But I feel what's to happen</i>

31
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,391
<i>All happened before</i>

32
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,476
Arf! Arf! Grrrr!

33
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,688
I'm sorry. Where was I?

34
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,516
Thank you, one and all,
for your kind support.

35
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,060
Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.

36
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,792
Crikey.

37
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,502
Bless you, guv.

38
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,213
Generosity itself,
that's what you are.

39
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,907
No charge.

40
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,363
Oh, it's you. Hello.

41
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,184
Number 17 Cherry
Tree Lane, you say?

42
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,083
All right. Come with me.

43
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:58,046
This here's Cherry Tree Lane.

44
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,653
Nice little spot, you might say.

45
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,678
Number 17 is just down a bit.

46
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,954
Now this imposing edifice
what first greets the eye

47
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,456
is the home of Admiral Boom,

48
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,584
late of His Majesty's navy.

49
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:21,737
Likes his house shipshape and
Bristol fashion at all times.

50
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:31,682
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.

51
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,832
- Three minutes and six seconds.
- Aye, aye, sir.

52
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,981
What he's famous
for is punctuality.

53
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,317
The whole world takes its
time from Greenwich,

54
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:45,446
but Greenwich takes its
time from Admiral Boom.

55
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,281
What cheer, Admiral?

56
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,534
Good afternoon!
Where are you bound?

57
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:54,079
Some parties want to see number 17.

58
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,124
- Enter that in the log.
- Aye, aye, sir.

59
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,335
Some advice, young man.

60
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,338
Storm signals are up at 17.

61
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,673
Heavy weather brewing there.

62
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,277
Thank you, sir.
I'll keep an eye skinned.

63
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,013
Here we are.

64
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:15,643
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane,
residence of George Banks, esquire.

65
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,522
Hello, hello, hello.
The admiral's right.

66
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,777
Heavy weather brewing at
number 17, and no mistake.

67
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,987
Leave her alone!

68
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,531
Don't you be trying to stop
the wretched creature!

69
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,700
Let her go and good riddance.

70
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,869
I never liked her from the
moment she set foot in the door.

71
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,916
But who'll get stuck with
the children? Me, that's who!

72
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,210
Her and her high and mighty ways.

73
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,420
And that face of her that would
stop a coal barge, it would.

74
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,630
Indeed, Mrs Brill!

75
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,715
I wouldn't stay in this
house another minute

76
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,385
for all the jewels in Christendom.

77
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,054
No, Katie Nanna, don't go!

78
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,514
Stand away from that door!

79
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,164
What'll I tell the master
about the children?

80
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,726
It's no concern of mine.

81
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,980
Those beasts ran away from me.

82
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:06,360
They must be somewhere.
Did you look around the zoo?

83
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,405
You think the lion got them?

84
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,074
They're fond of hanging
around the cage.

85
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,076
I've said my say.

86
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,954
I've done with this house forever.

87
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,747
Hip, hip, hooray!

88
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,792
Don't stumble on the way out.

89
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,336
No, no, Katie Nanna!

90
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,825
Mrs Banks. She's home.

91
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,844
<i>Our daughter's
daughters will adore us</i>

92
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,415
<i>And we'll sing in grateful chorus
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"</i>

93
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,516
Good evening,
Katie Nanna and Ellen.

94
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,768
The meeting was glorious!

95
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,106
Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained herself
to the prime minister's carriage.

96
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,525
You should have been there!

97
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,379
And Mrs Ainslie was
carried off to prison.

98
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,572
Singing and scattering
pamphlets all the way!

99
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,616
Madam, I've always given my best...

100
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,640
Thank you, Katie Nanna.

101
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,722
I knew you were one of us.

102
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:03,625
<i>We're clearly soldiers
in petticoats</i>

103
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,671
<i>And dauntless crusaders
for women's votes</i>

104
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,633
<i>Though we adore men individually</i>

105
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:16,305
<i>We agree that as a group
they're rather stupid</i>

106
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,389
Mrs Banks...

107
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,143
<i>Cast off the shackles of yesterday</i>

108
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,813
<i>Shoulder to shoulder into the fray</i>

109
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,358
<i>Our daughter's
daughters will adore us</i>

110
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:32,654
<i>And they'll sing in grateful chorus</i>

111
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,908
<i>"Well done, Sister Suffragette"</i>

112
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,827
I don't wish to offend, but...

113
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:43,082
<i>From Kensington to Billingsgate
One hears the restless cries</i>

114
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:47,044
<i>From every corner of the land
Womankind, arise</i>

115
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,672
<i>Political equality and
equal rights with men</i>

116
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:55,344
<i>Take heart, for Mrs Pankhurst
has been clapped in irons again</i>

117
00:09:55,345 --> 00:10:00,167
<i>No more the meek and
mild subservients we</i>

118
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:06,271
<i>We're fighting for our
rights militantly</i>

119
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,815
<i>Never you fear</i>

120
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:11,026
If I may have a word...

121
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:15,948
<i>So cast off the
shackles of yesterday</i>

122
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,535
<i>Shoulder to shoulder into the fray</i>

123
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:24,039
<i>Our daughter's daughters
will adore us</i>

124
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,710
<i>And they'll sing in grateful chorus</i>

125
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,003
<i>"Well done"</i>

126
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,046
Mrs Banks!

127
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,173
<i>"Well done"</i>

128
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,175
Mrs Banks!

129
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,052
What is it, Katie Nanna?

130
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,556
I have something to say to you.

131
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,099
Where are the children?

132
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,311
The children, to be
precise, are not here.

133
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,855
They've disappeared again.

134
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,482
That's really careless of you.

135
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,484
That's the third time this week.

136
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,111
The fourth, madam.

137
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,572
I've had my fill.

138
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,407
I'm not one to speak
ill of the children.

139
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,450
When do you expect them home?

140
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,996
I couldn't say. If you'd
compute my wages...

141
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,207
Oh, gracious! You're not leaving?

142
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,917
What will Mr Banks say?

143
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,421
He'll be cross when he finds
the children missing.

144
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:17,278
Put these away. The cause
infuriates Mr Banks.

145
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,971
I beseech you, please reconsider.

146
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,431
Think of the children.

147
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,457
Think of Mr Banks. He was
just getting used to you.

148
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,169
Posts, everyone!

149
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:41,742
4, 3, 2, 1...

150
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,095
Fire!

151
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,991
- I do beseech you...
- My wages, if you please.

152
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,974
Bit early tonight, Admiral?

153
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,186
Nonsense. Bang on
the dot, as usual.

154
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,563
How's the world of finance?

155
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,773
Never better.

156
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:16,068
Money's sound, credit
rates are moving up,

157
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,988
- and the pound is admired everywhere.
- Good.

158
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,490
How about you?

159
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,243
Bit chancy, I'd say.

160
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,787
The Wind's up.
The glass is falling.

161
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,623
- Don't like it.
- Good. Good, good.

162
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:34,336
Banks, you're steering into
a nasty piece of weather.

163
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,438
Banks!

164
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,440
Do you hear me?

165
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:43,531
Hello, Katie Nanna. That
must be heavy. Allow me.

166
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,450
Hmph!

167
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,078
What a very pretty hat.

168
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:01,029
<i>I feel a surge of
deep satisfaction</i>

169
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,241
<i>Much as a king astride
his noble steed</i>

170
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:05,325
Thank you.

171
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:09,663
<i>When I return from daily
strife to hearth and wife</i>

172
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,582
<i>How pleasant is the life I lead</i>

173
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,960
- Dear, the children...
- Yes, yes, yes.

174
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,714
<i>I run my home precisely on schedule</i>

175
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:22,676
<i>At 6:01, I march through my door</i>

176
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:26,888
<i>My slippers, sherry, and
pipe are due at 6:02</i>

177
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,683

178
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,976
George, they're missing.

179
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,728
Splendid, splendid.

180
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:36,440
<i>It's grand to be an
Englishman in 1910</i>

181
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:40,277
<i>King Edward's on the

183
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,826

186
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,003
<i>And adequately fed</i>

187
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:02,215
<i>And so I'll pat them on the head
and send them off to bed</i>

188
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:07,823
<i>Ah, lordly is the life I lead</i>

189
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,749
Winifred, where are the children?

190
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,044
They're not here, dear.

191
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:17,439
Of course they're here.
Where else would they be?

192
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,025
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

193
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,820
They're missing. Katie Nanna
has looked everywhere.

194
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,800
Very well. I'll deal
with this at once.

195
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,871
The police station.
Quickly, please.

196
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,291
We needn't bother
the police. The fact is...

197
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,460
Facts cloud the issue.

198
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,631
One fact alone is clear.
Katie Nanna's faltered.

199
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,986
She's disappointed us.
I shall bring her to book...

200
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,969
Oh.

201
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,974
- She's left us, hasn't she?
- Yes, only just.

202
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,749
George Banks here.

203
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,670
17 Cherry Tree Lane.
It's a matter of some urgency.

204
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,151
Please send a policeman.

205
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,487
The policeman's here, George.

206
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:09,116
What? Oh. Very prompt.
Wonderful service.

207
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,827
Thank you so much. Good night.

208
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,079
Come in, constable.

209
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,875
While on duty across the park,
I noted some stray valuables.

210
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,399
- I believe they're yours.
- Valuables?

211
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,773
Come along now.

212
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,843
Jane.

213
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,344
Michael.

214
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,096
Winifred, don't be emotional.

215
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:35,475
I wouldn't be too hard on them, sir.
They've had a long, weary walk today.

216
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,999
Children, come here at once.

217
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,942
Well?

218
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:48,029
- Sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.
- It was windy...

219
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,407
And the kite was too strong.

220
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:54,369
The kite ran away,
sir, not the children.

221
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,873
Thank you. I'll manage this.

222
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,877
It wasn't a good kite.
We made it ourselves.

223
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,254
Perhaps if you helped us...

224
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:08,008
That's the ticket.
Kites are skittish things.

225
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,634
Only last week...

226
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,220
I'm very grateful
to you, constable.

227
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:16,683
The cook will find you
a plate of something.

228
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,020
I shall now return to my duties.

229
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,373
Thank you, constable.

230
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:26,401
Good night, miss. Good night,
ma'am. Good night, sir.

231
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,051
"Cook will find something."

232
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,118
I'm awfully sorry
about this, George.

233
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,412
You'll want to discuss it.

234
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,789
I would, indeed.

235
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,167
Ellen, take the children upstairs.

236
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,861
Yes, sir.

237
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,922
I knew it.

238
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:50,634
Who bears the brunt of everything?

239
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,135
Me, that's who.

240
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:56,014
They don't want an honest
working girl here.

241
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,709
They need a ruddy zoo keeper.

242
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,644
Sorry.

243
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:04,856
When I chose Katie Nanna,
I thought she'd be firm.

244
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,983
She looked solemn, cross.

245
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,612
Never confuse efficiency
with a liver complaint.

246
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,447
I'll do better next time.

247
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:18,203
Next time? You've engaged six nannies.
They've all been unqualified disasters.

248
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,579
I quite agree.

249
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,457
Choosing a nanny is
a delicate task,

250
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:27,837
requiring insight, balanced judgment,
and an ability to read character.

251
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,422
Under the circumstances,

252
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:34,553
it might be apropos to select
the next person myself.

253
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,929
Would you, George?

254
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,224
I'll do this properly.

255
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,142
I'll advertise in The Times.

256
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,478
- Take this down, please.
- Yes, of course.

257
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,439
Wanted... No, required...

258
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,691
Nanny.

259
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,762
Firm, respectable, no-nonsense.

263
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,459
<i>It is a nanny who can give commands</i>

264
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,004
- Getting this, Winifred?
- Yes, every word.

270
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:34,321
Splendid, George. Inspirational.
<i>The Times</i> will be so pleased.

271
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,800
- Father.
- Yes?

272
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:41,870
We've discussed everything,
and we're very sorry about today.

273
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,705
I should think so.

274
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,958
- It was wrong.
- Indeed.

275
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,210
We'll cooperate with the new nanny.

276
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,422
I'll be glad for your help.

277
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:55,467
That's why we wrote

00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,593
Advertisement for what?

I congratulate myself

- Nonsense. Witches have brooms.

It's her. It's the person. She's
answered our advertisement.

00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,664
I never give references.

352
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,749
I believe it very old-fashioned.

353
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,711
We'll see about that then.

354
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,860
Now then, the qualifications.

355
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,217
Item one, "A cheery disposition."

356
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,969
I am never cross.

357
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,038
Item two, "Rosy cheeks."

358
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,724
Obviously.

359
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:21,644
Item three,
"Play games, all sorts."

360
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,313
They'll find my games
extremely diverting.

361
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:27,942
Where did you get this paper?
I tore it up.

362
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,360
Excuse me.

363
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,904
Item four, "You must be kind."

364
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:35,074
I am kind, but extremely firm.

365
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,410
Have you lost something?

366
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:40,496
That paper. I thought that I...

367
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,124
You are George Banks?

368
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,418
And you did advertise for a nanny?

369
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:47,920
George Banks.

370
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,068
Very well, then.

371
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:55,454
Tore it up, turned it over,
threw it in the...

372
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,573
Are you ill?

373
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,992
I hope not.

374
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,560
About my wages...

375
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,396
- The reference is obscure.
- Obscure.

376
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,191
We must be clear on that.

377
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,967
- I require every second Tuesday off.
- Every Tuesday.

378
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,973
Perhaps a trial
period would be wise.

379
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,697
Hmm... I'll give you one week.
I'll know by then.

380
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,944
I'll see the children now.

381
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,133
Close your mouth.
We are not codfish.

382
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,533
Don't stand there.
Best foot forward.

383
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,011
Spit spot.

384
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,581
George?
- Aah!

385
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,751
I thought you were
interviewing nannies.

386
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,545
I was, I was.

387
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,130
You've selected one already?

388
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,881
Yes, it's done.

389
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:17,718
- Where is she?
- In the nursery.

390
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,263
- I put her to work straight-away.
- How clever.

391
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:23,224
I'd have muddled everything.

392
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:27,603
Is she everything that
we hoped she'd be?

393
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:31,732
It all happened rather quickly.
I mean, I... I, uh...

394
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,110
Will she be firm and give commands?

395
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:37,135
Will she mould our young breed?

396
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,301
Winifred, I think she will.

397
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,952
I think she Will!

398
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:46,789
In that case, perhaps Ellen
should dismiss the others.

399
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,583
The others?

400
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,586
- Ellen!
- Yes, sir?

401
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,755
Tell the others the
position's been filled.

402
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,110
- The others, sir?
- Yes, the others.

403
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:03,040
How many nannies does
this house need?

404
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,587
The position has been filled.

405
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,862
I'm afraid the nursery
isn't very tidy.

406
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,198
Rather like a bear pit.

407
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,867
- That's a funny bag.
- Carpet.

408
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,244
- To carry carpets?
- No, made of.

409
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,724
Your room has a lovely view.

410
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,893
Hmm...

411
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,648
It's not exactly
Buckingham Palace...

412
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,318
Still, it's clean.

413
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,596
Yes, it will be quite suitable.

414
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,415
Just needs a touch here and there.

415
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,477
First things first.

416
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:53,924
The place to hang a hat
is on a hat stand.

417
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:08,704
Oh!

418
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,024
This will never do.

419
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:20,109
I much prefer seeing all
of my face at once.

420
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,053
But there was nothing in it.

421
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:28,557
Never judge things by their
appearance, even carpetbags.

422
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,955
I never do.

423
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:38,878
"A thing of beauty
is a joy forever."

424
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,973
Hmm... A little more light perhaps.

425
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,840
We'd better watch this one.

426
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,718
- She's tricky.
- She's wonderful.

427
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,492
Much better.

428
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,374
Now, let me see.

429
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:19,525
That's funny. I always carry it.
It must be here somewhere.

430
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,402
- What?
- My tape measure.

431
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:24,723
- What for?
- To see how you measure up.

432
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,831
That's the funniest
thing I ever saw.

433
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,355
Ah ha ha ha. Here it is.

434
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,501
Good.

435
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,276
Come along, then. Quickly.

436
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,529
Head up, Michael. Don't slouch.

437
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,597
Just as I thought. "Extremely
stubborn and suspicious."

438
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,793
- I am not.
- See for yourself.

439
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:58,715
- "Extremely stubborn and susips..."
- Suspicious.

440
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,718
Now you, Jane.

441
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:08,179
"Rather inclined to giggle.
Doesn't put things away."

442
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,810
How about you?

443
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,731
Very well. Hold this for me.

444
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,711
As I expected.

445
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,840
"Mary Poppins, practically
perfect in every way."

446
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:28,912
Mary Poppins.
Is that your name? It's lovely.

447
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,305
I've always liked it.

448
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,808
Shall we move?

449
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:37,269
In your advertisement,
did you not request games?

450
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,088
Yes.

451
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,483
First we'll play
"Well Begun Is Half Done."

452
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,151
That sounds suspicious.

453
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,405
Otherwise entitled,
"Let's Tidy Up The Nursery."

454
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,759
I told you she was tricky.

455
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:52,701
Shall we begin?

456
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,663
It is a game, isn't it?

457
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,499
Depends on your viewpoint.

458
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,671
You see, in every job that must be
done, there is an element of fun.

459
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:07,948
You find the fun,
and snap, the job's a game.

460
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,762
<i>And every task you undertake</i>

461
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,098
<i>becomes a piece of cake</i>

462
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,517
<i>A lark, a spree</i>

463
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:20,187
<i>It's very clear to see</i>

464
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:23,107
<i>That a</i>

465
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:27,862
<i>spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down</i>

466
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:32,074
<i>The medicine go down
Medicine go down</i>

467
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:36,829
<i>Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down</i>

468
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,708
<i>In a most delightful way</i>

469
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:49,925
<i>A robin feathering his nest
has very little time to rest</i>

470
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:53,888
<i>While gathering his
bits of twine and twig</i>

471
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:58,601
<i>Though quite intent in his pursuit
He has a merry tune to toot</i>

472
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,936
<i>He knows a song</i>

473
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:06,589
<i>Will move the job along</i>

474
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:18,996
<i>For a spoonful of sugar

475
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:23,209
<i>The medicine go down
Medicine go down</i>

476

<i>Just a spoonful of sugar

477
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:32,035
<i>In a most delightful way</i>

478
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:37,950
<i>The honeybees that fetch the nectar
from the flowers to the comb</i>

479
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:41,579
<i>Never tire of ever
buzzing to and fro</i>

480
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,958
<i>Because they take a little nip
from every flower that they sip</i>

481
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,835
<i>And hence</i>

482
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,169
<i>And hence</i>

483
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,296
<i>They find</i>

484
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,505
<i>They find</i>

485
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:56,737
<i>Their task is not a grind
Their task is not a grind</i>

486
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:04,127
<i>Aaah</i>

487
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,917
Cheeky.

488
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,130
Don't be all day.

489
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,453
Let me out! Let me out!

490
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,804
Let me out!

491
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,135
Well...

492
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,593
Thank you now.

493
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,017
When you've quite finished!

494
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,272
Thank you.

495
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,753
That's quite sufficient.

496
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,297
Hats and coats, please.

497
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,091
It's time for our outing.

498
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:20,761
Let's tidy up the nursery again.

499
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,097
Enough's as good as a feast.

500
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:26,558
You're not as well
turned out as I'd like.

501
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,936
Still, there's time.

502
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,146
Spit Spot.

503
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,023
And off we go!

504
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:37,069
<i>For a spoonful of sugar

505
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,823
<i>The medicine go down

<i>I does what I likes and I likes...</i>

00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,935
<i>What I do</i>

511
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,083
Hello, art lovers.

512
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,002
<i>Today I'm a screever</i>

513
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:39,074
<i>And as you can see
A screever's an artist</i>

514
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,177
<i>Of highest degree</i>

515
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:47,624
<i>And it's all me own work
from me own memory</i>

516
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:53,103
Not Royal Academy.
Still, they're not bad, are they?

517
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,274
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo</i>

518
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,346
<i>I draws what I likes
and I likes what I drew</i>

519
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,118
<i>No remuneration do
I ask of you</i>

520
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,872
<i>But me cap would be
glad of a copper or two</i>

521
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:16,444
<i>Me cap would be glad
of a copper or two</i>

522
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,552
Wait!

523
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,137
Don't move.

524
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,182
Don't move a muscle.

525
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:33,002
Stay right where you are.

526
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,898
I'd know that silhouette anywhere.

527
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:41,674
- Mary Poppins!
- Hello, Bert.

528
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,987
You know Jane and Michael.

529
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,658
Well, I've seen them here and about.
Chasing a kite last time, weren't it?

530
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,932
We're going to the park.

531
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,579
To the park?

532
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,249
Not if I know Mary Poppins.

533
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,543
Other nannies go to the park.

534
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,712
When you're with Mary Poppins,

535
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:04,049
quick as you can say,
"Bob's your uncle,"

536
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,927
the most unusual things happen.

537
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,497
What are you talking about?

538
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,765
It's not my place to say,

539
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:16,103
but she probably has
in mind a jolly holiday.

540
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,047
Something along these lines.

541
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,504
That's always good. Here we go.

542
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:39,376
How about a lovely circus?
Lions and tigers.

543
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,627
World famous artistes

544
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:45,359
performing death-defying feats
of dexterity and skill.

545
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,243
Ta-da!

546
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,513
Ta-da!

547
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:16,121
Oh, that's lovely.
I'd much rather go there.

548
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:21,835
A typical English countryside
done by a loving hand.

549
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:28,133
Though you can't see it, there's a
little country fair down that road.

550
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,594
I don't see any road.

551
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,743
What? No road?

552
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:39,212
Just wants a bit of something here

553
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,592
and a bit of something there.

554
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,568
There.

555
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:50,405
A country road suitable for
travel and high adventure.

556
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,616
May we go, Mary Poppins, please?

557
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:56,370
Don't you think it's lovely,
Mary Poppins?

558
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,997
Now's the time. No one's looking.

559
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,708
Oh, please. Please.

560
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:05,109
I have no intention of making
a spectacle of myself.

561
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,195
All right. I'll do it myself.

562
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,133
Do what?

563
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,551
Bit of magic.

564
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,428
- Magic?
- It's easy.

565
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,721
Let's see.

566
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,745
You think.

567
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,601
You wink.

568
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:23,047
You do a double blink.

569
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,213
You close your eyes and jump.

570
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:33,448
Is something supposed to happen?

571
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,972
Bert, what utter nonsense.

572
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:36,848
Oh.

573
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,707
Why do you complicate things?

574
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,042
Give me your hand, Michael.
Don't slouch.

575
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,861
1, 2...

576
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:06,064
Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.

577
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:10,277
- Do you really think so?
- Cross my heart, you do.

578
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,779
You look fine, too, Bert.

579
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,073
Isn't there a fair?

580
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:19,327
Down the road and behind the hill.

581
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,788
I hear the merry-go-round.

582
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,938
- Tell them hello.
- Don't smudge the drawing.

583
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:34,051
<i>Ain't it a glorious day
Right as a mornin' in May</i>

584
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:37,247
<i>I feel like I could fly</i>

585
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,640
Now, Bert, none of
your larking about.

586
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:45,145
<i>Have you ever seen
the grass so green</i>

587
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:48,546
<i>Or a bluer sky</i>

588
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:55,822
<i>Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary</i>

589
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,492
<i>Mary makes your heart so light</i>

590
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,285
You haven't changed.

591
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:04,289
<i>When the day is grey and ordinary</i>

592
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,501
<i>Mary makes the sun shine bright</i>

593
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:08,668
Oh, honestly.

594
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:12,615
<i>Oh, happiness is bloomin'
all around her</i>

595
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:17,552
<i>The daffodils are
smiling at the dove</i>

596
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:21,890
<i>When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand</i>

597
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:26,371
<i>Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band</i>

598
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,816
You are light-headed.

599
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:34,945
<i>It's a jolly holiday with Mary</i>

600
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:38,300
<i>No wonder that it's
Mary that we love</i>

601
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:57,217
<i>Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary</i>

602
00:43:57,218 --> 00:44:01,323
<i>Mary makes your heart so light</i>

603
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:05,725
<i>When the day is grey and ordinary</i>

604
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:09,896
<i>Mary makes the sun shine bright</i>

605
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:14,568
<i>Oh, happiness is
bloomin' all around her</i>

606
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:18,488
<i>The daffodils are smiling
at the dove, oink, oink</i>

607
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:23,243
<i>When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand</i>

608
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:27,474
<i>Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band</i>

609
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:34,087
<i>It's a jolly holiday with Mary</i>

610
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:37,988
<i>No wonder that it's
Mary that we love</i>

611
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,564
Thank you.

612
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:19,134
Our pleasure, Mary Poppins.

613
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:28,808
<i>Oh, it's a jolly
holiday with you, Bert</i>

614
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:32,038
<i>Gentlemen like you are few</i>

615
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,540
A vanishing breed.

616
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:38,044
<i>Though you're just a
diamond in the rough, Bert</i>

617
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,922
<i>Underneath your blood is blue</i>

618
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,299
Common knowledge.

619
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,553
<i>You'd never think of
pressing your advantage</i>

620
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:50,890
<i>Forbearance is the
hallmark of your creed</i>

621
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:55,312
<i>A lady needn't fear
when you are near</i>

622
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:59,649
<i>Your sweet gentility
is crystal clear</i>

623
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:04,070
<i>Oh, it's a jolly
holiday with you, Bert</i>

624
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:08,677
<i>A jolly, jolly holiday with you</i>

625
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,278
Waiter! Waiter?

626
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,862
Now then, what would be nice?

627
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,781
<i>We'll start with raspberry ice</i>

628
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:51,807
<i>And then some cakes and tea</i>

629
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:54,371
<i>Order what you will</i>

630
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:56,581
<i>There'll be no bill</i>

631
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,501
<i>It's complimentary</i>

632
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:00,794
You're very kind.

633
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:04,005
Anything for you, Mary Poppins.

634
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,924
You're our favourite person.

635
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:07,550
Right you are.

636
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,927
It's true that...

637
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,720
<i>Mavis and Sybil have
ways that are winning</i>

638
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,555
<i>And Prudence and Gwendolyn
set your heart spinnin'</i>

639
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,140
<i>Phoebe's delightful
Maude is disarming</i>

640
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,475
<i>Felicia, Janice and Lydia</i>

641
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:17,852
<i>Charming!
Cynthia's dashing, Vivian's sweet</i>

642
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,479
<i>Stephanie's smashing,
Priscilla a treat</i>

643
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,606
<i>Veronica, Millicent,
Agnes, and Jane</i>

644
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,566
<i>Convivial company, time and again</i>

645
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:27,153
<i>Dorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts
I'll agree are three jolly good sports</i>

646
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:31,725
<i>But cream of the crop, tip of the top
is Mary Poppins and there we stop</i>

647
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:14,302
<i>When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand</i>

648
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:18,056
<i>Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band</i>

649
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:19,534
Woo!

650
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:24,354
<i>It's a jolly holiday with Mary</i>

651
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:27,334
<i>No wonder that it's
Mary that we love</i>

652
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:31,945
<i>No wonder that it's
Mary that we love</i>

653
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:37,268
<i>No wonder that it's
Mary that we love</i>

654
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,316
Yahoo!

655
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,116
Yahoo!

656
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:48,021
Yahoo! Yahoo!

657
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:51,691
Our own private merry-go-round.

658
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:55,778
Nice. Very nice, indeed,

659
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,472
if you don't want to go nowhere.

660
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,242
Who says we're not going anywhere?

661
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,535
Oh, guard!

662
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,139
Righto, Mary Poppins.

663
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,392
Thank you.

664
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,221
They're off!

665
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:25,826
Mary Poppins leads by two
lengths, Jane's second by...

666
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,978
My horse is the fastest.

667
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:56,861
Hear that, mate?
Want to put up with that?

668
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:59,926
Is that the best you can do?

669
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,469
Hurry up, boy!

670
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,039
Not so fast, please. Michael.

671
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,202
Bert, you're just as bad.

672
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,713
Sorry. Whoa, boy. Whoa.

673
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,004
Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa.

674
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:20,780
Just a bit of high spirits,
Mary Poppins.

675
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:24,431
Please control yourself.
We're not on a racecourse.

676
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:32,067
Follow me, please.

677
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:51,037
- Good morning.
- Oh, yes, quite. What?

678
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,170
I say.

679
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,818
Have you...

680
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,011
Ever?

681
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,551
Never!

682
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:14,083
View halloo.

683
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,711
Oh, yes, definitely. A view halloo.

684
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,671
View halloo?

685
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:25,492
Faith and Begorra.
'Tis them redcoats again.

686
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,311
Oh, musha, musha.

687
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:35,188
Poor little bloke.

688
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:37,315
Let's give him a hand.

689
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:39,692
Saints preserve us.

690
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,295
Yikes!

691
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,141
Tally ho! Da-doo da-doo!

692
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:57,187
Up you go. Now hang on.

693
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:04,902
Would you look at this?
An elegant merry-go-round horse.

694
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:11,492
Come on, you dirty omadhauns.
I'll lick all of you.

695
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:15,296
Faster, me beauty. Faster!

696
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:08,573
Riders, would you be
kind and let me pass?

697
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:11,450
Certainly, ma'am.

698
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,179
- Thank you.
- Not at all, ma'am.

699
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,178
Excellent time, gentlemen.

700
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,281
- Quite.
- Perfect day for it.

701
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,993
Ahem.

702
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,878
Oh, how nice.

703
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,051
Hooray! Yay! Yay!

- Well...

- Gaining fame and fortune.
- Yes.

I'll stay until the wind changes.

779
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:21,635
How long will that be?

780
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,804
It's time to go to sleep.

781
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:27,850
We couldn't possibly go to sleep.
So many lovely things happened today!

782
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,018
Did they?

783
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:31,187
We jumped into Bert's picture.

784
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,939
The horses fled the carousel.

785
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,192
And we went riding!

786
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:39,111
Tally ho! Tchunga!
Tally ho! Yoicks!

787
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,154
Really?

788
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:43,532
Don't you remember?
You won the race.

789
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:47,661
A respectable person like me?
How dare you.

790
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,206
I saw you do it.

791
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,834
Another word and I'll
summon a policeman.

792
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,920
I saw it happen!

793
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:59,131
- Go to sleep.
- I don't want to.

794
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,926

01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:42,053
<i>And dream</i>

816
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:59,084
Glorious day,
Mr Binnacle, glorious.

817
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:03,088
Nobody sleeps this morning.
Put in double powder.

818
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,549
A double charge? Aye, sir.

819
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,824
Shake things up a bit, what?

820
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:13,265
- Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.
- Indeed it is, ma'am.

821
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:16,435
- You packed the spoiled eggs?
- Yes.

822
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:22,043
After our meeting, we're all going to
throw things at the prime minister.

823
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,652
How distinguished you look today.

824
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:28,781
What's all that
fearful caterwauling?

825
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,282
It's cook singing.

826
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:34,453
- What's wrong with her?
- She's happy as a cricket.

827
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:37,539
Since you hired Mary Poppins,

828
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,210
the most extraordinary thing
has come over the household.

829
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:46,131
- Ellen hasn't broken a dish all morning.
- That is extraordinary.

830
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:51,261
She and cook fight like
cats and dogs, but today...

831
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:54,957
- I'll hold the door.
- Thanks ever so.

832
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,234
Ellen, stop making
that offensive noise.

833
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:09,757

I don't think there's
anything to explain.

I should like to be quite clear.

857
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:29,151
I am not out of sorts. I'm
in a perfectly equable mood.

858

I do not require being
made to feel better!

You're always saying you want a
cheerful and pleasant household.

I should like to make a differentiation
between cheerful and...

Excuse me, dear.

862
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,791

undermine the discipline...

That is entirely beside the point!

876
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,555
Now, let me see.

877
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:42,266
We must go to the piano tuners,

878
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:47,123
then to Mrs Cory's shop
for some gingerbread,

879
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:52,734
then to the fishmonger's
for dover sole and prawns.

880
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,571
Michael, stop stravaging
along behind.

881
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:56,738
Ahoy, there!

882
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,386
Ahoy!

883
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:03,120
- Good day to you.
- Good morning, Admiral.

884
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:08,333
What fine adventure are
we off upon today?

885
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,002
Going to fight the Hottentots?

886
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:12,296
Dig for buried treasure?

887
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:14,506
We're going to buy fish.

888
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:17,801
Very good. Proceed at flank speed.

889
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:19,428
Aye, aye, sir.

890
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,139
Let's put our backs into it.

891
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,460
More spit and polish.
That's what's wanted.

892
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:28,834
Andrew.

893
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:32,341
Woof! Woof! Woof!
Woof! Woof! Woof!

894
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,861
Slow down. I can't
understand a word.

895
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:38,465
Woof! Woof! Woof!

896
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,429
Again?

897
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:42,514
The poor man.

898
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,979
Woof! Woof! Woof!

899
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,584
Woof! Ah-choo!

900
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,028
Bless you.

901
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,589
Woof! Woof! Woof!

902
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:58,925
Why, yes, certainly.
I'll go straight-away.

903
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,903
- Thank you very much.
- Woof!

904
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,202
- What did he say?
- "You're welcome."

905
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:07,643
- And?
- He didn't say anything.

906
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,853
You know best.

907
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:12,377
I thought we were buying fish.

908
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,842
There's been a change of plans.

909
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,930
Come along, please.
Don't straggle.

910
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,540
Andrew, worrying won't help anyone.

911
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,518
You should go home and rest.

912
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,149
Woof!

913
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,724
- Bert, I'm glad you're here.
- I came right away.

914
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:49,768
How is he?

915
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:52,543
He's never been worse.

916
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,856
How about them?
It's contagious, you know.

917
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:57,506
- We'll get spots?
- Unlikely.

918
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,236
Ohh! Hoo hoo hoo!

919
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:01,405
Oh, Uncle Albert.

920
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:03,824
Bless my soul.

921
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:06,553
It's Mary Poppins.
I'm delight... Ha-ha!

922
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:08,912
I'm delighted to see you.

923
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,706
Uncle Albert, you promised.

924
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:13,625
Ha-ha! I know.

925
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:17,087
I tried, really, I did. I... Ho ho!

926
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:21,133
But I so enjoy laughing. Ah ha ha!

927
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:25,137
When I start, it's up with...
Ha ha ha!

928
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:27,806
That's what happens.

929
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,433
I love to laugh! Ah ho ho!

930
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:32,644
Oh, my! I can't help it.

931
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,396
Ha ha ha!

932
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,545
I just like laughing.

933
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,425
Ha ha! Ha ha!

934
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:42,404
Don't you dare.
You'll only make him worse.

935
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:46,950
- It's quite serious.
- Keep a straight face.

936
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:50,646
Last time, we took three
days to get him down.

937
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:55,083
<i>I love to laugh</i>

938
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:56,585
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

939
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,712
<i>Loud and long and clear</i>

940
01:10:58,713 --> 01:10:59,838
Ha!

941
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,442
<i>I love to laugh</i>

942
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,884
Ha ha ha ha!

943
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:06,595
<i>It's getting worse every year</i>

944
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:07,721
Ha ha ha!

945
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:09,973
<i>The more I laugh</i>

946
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:11,266
Ho ho ho!

947
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,810
<i>The more I fill with glee</i>

948
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,353
You're no help!

949
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:16,855
<i>The more the glee</i>

950
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:18,732
Ha ha ha ha!

951
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:21,193
<i>The more I'm a merrier me</i>

952
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:22,360
Hoo hoo hoo!

953
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,362
It's embarrassing.

954
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:27,699
<i>The more I'm a merrier me</i>

955
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,427
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

956
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:33,022
Ha ha ha ha!

957
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:37,292
<i>Some people laugh
through their noses</i>

958
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,753
<i>Sounding something like this</i>

959
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:41,505
Mmm-hmm hmm hmm!

960
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:42,698
Dreadful.

961
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,317
Sss-sss-sss!

962
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:48,720
<i>Some people laugh through
their teeth Goodness sakes</i>

963
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,324
<i>Hissing and fizzing like snakes</i>

964
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:52,390
Sss sss sss!

965
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,994
Not at all attractive.

966
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:57,604
<i>Some laugh too fast</i>

967
01:11:57,605 --> 01:11:59,457
Hee hee hee hee!

968
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,335
<i>Some only blast</i>

969
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:04,299
Ha!

970
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,948
<i>Others they twitter like birds</i>

971
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:10,222
Hee hee hee hoo! Hee hee hee hoo!

972
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,828
You're as bad as he is.

973
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:16,854
<i>Then there's that kind what
can't make up their mind</i>

974
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,334
Hmm hmm hmm, ha ha ha!

975
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,086
Hee hee hee, ho ho ho!

976
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:22,609
Hee ha ho huh?

977
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:29,469
<i>When things strike me as funny
I can't hide it inside</i>

978
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:34,140
<i>And squeak, hee,
as the squeakelers do</i>

979
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,267
Ha ha ha!

980
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:38,019
<i>I've got to let go</i>

981
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,939
<i>With a ho ho ho ho</i>

982
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,190
Ha ha ha ha!

983
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:47,320
<i>And a ho ho ho, hoo!</i>

984
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,155
How nice!

985
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:52,385
I was hoping you'd turn up.

986
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:55,309
We always have a jolly time.

987
01:12:57,123 --> 01:13:00,542
<i>We love to laugh</i>

988
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,127
Ha ha ha ha!

989
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:04,421
<i>Loud and long and clear</i>

990
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:05,547
Hoo hoo hoo!

991
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:07,591
<i>We love to laugh</i>

992
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:09,801
Ha ha ha ha!

993
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:11,887
<i>So everybody can hear</i>

994
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:13,221
Ha ha ha!

995
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,724
<i>The more you laugh</i>

996
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:18,310
Don't you start. Come back here.

997
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,644
<i>We fill With glee</i>

998
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:20,729
Hee hee hee!

999
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:23,299
<i>And the more the glee</i>

1000
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:24,649
Ha ha ha ha!

1001
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,720
<i>The more we're a merrier we</i>

1002
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:37,329
Welcome, children. Welcome.
Make yourselves comfortable.

1003
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:39,603
Pull up a chair.

1004
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,586
I say, you're a sight.

1005
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:49,007
Speaking of sight,
it reminds me of me brother.

1006
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:51,176
He works in a watch factory.

1007
01:13:51,177 --> 01:13:53,970
What's he do?

1008
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:57,871
He stands about all
day and makes faces.

1009
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:03,131
Makes faces in a watch factory!

1010
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:06,629
You made that up.

1011
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:13,365
That's good.

1012
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:15,184
Such behaviour.

1013
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:25,043
It's disgraceful or my
name isn't Mary Poppins.

1014
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:28,380
I know a man with a
wooden leg named Smith.

1015
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:31,280
What's the name of his other leg?

1016
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:35,220
Wasn't that funny?
What's the name of...

1017
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:39,474
Children, it's tea time. I won't
have schedule interruptions.

1018
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,726
Please stay.

1019
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,187
Look, I have tea ready for you.

1020
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:46,064
And it's getting cold.

1021
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:49,760
I had hoped that maybe you would...

1022
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:56,032
Splendid! Thank you very much.

1023
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:58,159
Mind the bread and butter.

1024
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,411
Now watch, children.

1025
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:03,540
I knew she'd do it... A proper tea.

1026
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,876
I suppose you'll want me to pour.

1027
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:09,651
If I must, I must.

1028
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:14,634
But stop behaving
like laughing hyenas.

1029
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:17,429
- Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
- Yes, please.

1030
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,890
- Bed?
- None for me.

1031
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:24,541
I'm glad you came.
It wouldn't be fun otherwise.

1032
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:27,897
Pour some milk for
Michael and yourself.

1033
01:15:27,898 --> 01:15:31,651
- Nice weather we're having.
- Yes.

1034
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:37,430
The other day when it was cold,
a friend bought long underwear.

1035
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:41,578
The shopkeeper said,
"How long do you want it?"

1036
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:45,479
My friend said,
"From September to March."

1037
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:52,399
Jane! Control yourself!

1038
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,990
Children, please sit up properly.

1039
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:01,681
- Your tea, Uncle Albert.
- Thank you, dear.

1040
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,975
I'm having fun.

1041
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:07,395
I wish you could always stay here.

1042
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:10,440
We'll have to. There's no way down.

1043
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:12,776
Oh, there is a way.

1044
01:16:12,777 --> 01:16:18,198
I hate mentioning it because you
must think of something sad.

1045
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:20,158
Do it, please.

1046
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:23,161
Let me see.

1047
01:16:23,162 --> 01:16:25,663
I've got the very thing.

1048
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:29,814
Yesterday, when my neighbour
answered the bell, a man was there.

1049
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:36,174
The man said, "I'm terribly sorry.
I just ran over your cat."

1050
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:39,427
- Oh, that's sad.
- The poor cat.

1051
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,639
Then he said,
"I'll replace your cat."

1052
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,119
She said, "Okay,
but can you catch mice?"

1053
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:52,607
I started out saying...

1054
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:54,984
I try. Really, I do.

1055
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:58,571
But everything ends
up so hilarious. I can't...

1056
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,720
I can't help...

1057
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,746
That will be enough of that.

1058
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:09,207
It's time to go home.

1059
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,501
Oh, that is sad. Oh, no.

1060
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:14,902
That's the saddest
thing I ever heard.

1061
01:17:15,923 --> 01:17:18,174
Come along, children.

1062
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:20,927
Must you really go?

1063
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:26,808
People come to see me all the time,
and we have such a lovely time.

1064
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:32,230
Then they go home,
and I'm very, very sad about it.

1065
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:34,899
Don't worry. We'll return soon.

1066
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,985
It was lovely.

1067
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:40,905
- Keep an eye on him, Bert.
- I'll stay a while.

1068
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,599
Thank you.

1069
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:45,869
Uncle Albert,

1070
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:49,664
I got a jolly joke I saved
for just such an occasion.

1071
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:53,084
- Want to hear it?
- I'd be so grateful.

1072
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:56,671
Righto. It's about me granddad.

1073
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:59,090
One night, he had a nightmare.

1074
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:03,136
So scared he chewed
his pillow to bits.

1075
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:05,763
Next morning, I says,
"How do you feel?"

1076
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:09,539
He says,
"A little down in the mouth."

1077
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,609
There's nothing like a good joke.

1078
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:21,840
No, and that's nothing
like a good joke.

1079
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:40,073
Bit late tonight, aren't you?

1080
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,384
I say, Banks!

1081
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,803
Is anything the matter, Banks?

1082
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:47,747
Banks!

1083
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,273
We're so glad you're home!

1084
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:00,109
We had the most
wonderful afternoon.

1085
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:04,822
I know a man with a
wooden leg named Smith.

1086
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:07,909
We don't know anyone called Smith.

1087
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:12,747
The second chap says,
"What's his other leg's name?"

1088
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:15,750
And a party on the ceiling.

1089
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,585
Children, be quiet.

1090
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,546
Mary Poppins says we'll go again.

1091
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:21,773
Oh?

1092
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:24,259
Oh, Mary Poppins said that?

1093
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:27,887
Please return to your room.

1094
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:31,641
Mary Poppins,
will you come with me?

1095
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:33,460
As you wish.

1096
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:39,959
Mary Poppins, I regret
what I must say.

1097
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:46,864
Good evening, George.
Is anything the matter?

1098
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:48,116
I'm afraid so.

1099
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:51,202
I have to dress for my rally.

1100
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:55,248
- I'd rather you be present.
- Of course, George.

1101
01:19:55,249 --> 01:19:59,544
Mary Poppins, I confess
I'm disappointed in you.

1102
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:03,298
She's for it.
I've heard this before.

1103
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:05,550
I don't deny I'm
partially responsible

1104
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:10,346
for allowing the children's
worthless frivolity.

1105
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:13,224
But they must learn the
seriousness of life.

1106
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,518
But they're only children.

1107
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:17,729
In light of what's happened...

1108
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,565
George, are you certain?

1109
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:22,233
I believe I am.

1110
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:25,820
<i>A British bank is
run with precision</i>

1111
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:29,741
<i>A British home
requires nothing less</i>

1112
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:34,287
<i>Tradition, discipline, and
rules must be the tools</i>

1113
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:39,625
<i>Without them disorder,
chaos, moral disintegration</i>

1114
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:41,711
<i>In short, you have a ghastly mess</i>

1115
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:43,421
I quite agree.

1116
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:47,258
<i>The children must be
moulded, shaped and taught</i>

1117
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:50,762
<i>That life's a looming battle
to be faced and fought</i>

1118
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:55,475
I'm disturbed to hear my children
talking about popping into pictures,

1119
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:58,895
consorting with racehorse
persons, fox hunting...

1120
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:02,357
I don't mind that. It's tradition.

1121
01:21:02,358 --> 01:21:05,443
But parties on the ceiling?

1122
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:07,445
Having tea parties on the ceiling?

1123
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:10,448
And other highly
questionable outings...

1124
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:12,825
<i>If they must go on outings</i>

1125
01:21:12,826 --> 01:21:17,705
<i>These outings ought to be fraught
with purpose, yes, and practicality</i>

1126
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,729
<i>These silly words like</i>

1127
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:21,334
Superca...

1128
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:23,127
Super...

1129
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:24,545
Supercal...

1130
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,589
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

1131
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,257
Yes, well done.

1132
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:34,472
<i>And popping through pictures have
little use, fulfill no basic need</i>

1133
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:38,393
<i>They've got to learn the honest truth
Despite their youth</i>

1134
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:39,477
<i>They must learn</i>

1135
01:21:39,478 --> 01:21:42,021
<i>About the life you lead</i>

1136
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:43,439
Exactly.

1137
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:48,653
<i>They must feel the thrill of
totting up a balanced book</i>

1138
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:51,531
<i>A thousand ciphers neatly in a row</i>

1139
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:52,824
Quite right.

1140
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:56,661
<i>When gazing at a graph
that shows the profits up</i>

1141
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,831
<i>Their little cup of joy
should overflow</i>

1142
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:01,165
Precisely.

1143
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:04,961
<i>It's time they learnt to
walk in your footsteps</i>

1144
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:06,045
My footsteps.

1145
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:08,923
<i>To tread your straight
and narrow path with pride</i>

1146
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,007
With pride.

1147
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:11,759
<i>Tomorrow, just as you suggest</i>

1148
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:17,265
<i>Pressed and dressed Jane
and Michael will be at your side</i>

1149
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,184
Splendid! You've hit the nail...

1150
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:22,854
At my side? Where are we going?

1151
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:24,689
To the bank.

1152
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,816
- The bank?
- Yes.

1153
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:29,569
Tomorrow's an important day.

1154
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:32,469
I'll see they have a
proper night's sleep.

1155
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:47,545
Did I say I'd take the
children to the bank?

1156
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:50,214
It sounded that way.

1157
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,382
And why not?

1158
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:52,967
Capital idea.

1159
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:58,473
Just the medicine they need for all this
sugary female thinking they get here.

1160
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:00,391
Quite right. Good idea.

1161
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,335
Quite right.

1162
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,440
Mary Poppins, we won't let you go.

1163
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:09,192
What do you mean?

1164
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:11,027
Weren't you sacked?

1165
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:14,071
Sacked? I am never sacked.

1166
01:23:14,072 --> 01:23:16,824
- Oh, Mary Poppins!
- Hooray!

1167
01:23:16,825 --> 01:23:19,535
Neither am I a maypole.

1168
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:21,245
- But...
- Goats butt.

1169
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,538
Birds fly.

1170
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:26,751
Children going out with their
father get some sleep.

1171
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:28,650
An outing with Father?

1172
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:32,131
He's never taken us on an outing.

1173
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:35,202
He's never taken us anywhere.

1174
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,220
How did you manage it?

1175
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:39,931
You gave him the idea.

1176
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:42,225
How impertinent!

1177
01:23:42,226 --> 01:23:45,102
Me giving ideas to people? Really.

1178
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:47,772
- Where's he taking us?
- The bank.

1179
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:52,527
Michael, the city! Father
can point out the sights.

1180
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,972
Most things he can.

1181
01:23:55,572 --> 01:24:01,099
Sometimes people, through no fault of
their own, can't see past their nose.

1182
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:03,663
Past their nose?

1183
01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:07,667
Yes. Sometimes a little
thing is quite important.

1184
01:24:07,668 --> 01:24:09,794
Oh, look. The cathedral.

1185
01:24:09,795 --> 01:24:13,172
Father passes that every day.

1186
01:24:13,173 --> 01:24:19,220
<i>Early each day to the
steps of St. Paul's</i>

1187
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:24,999
<i>The little old bird woman comes</i>

1188
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:33,011
<i>In her own special way
to the people she calls</i>

1189
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:40,241
<i>Come buy my bags full of crumbs</i>

1190
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:43,995
<i>Come feed the little birds</i>

1191
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:47,373
<i>Show them you care</i>

1192
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:54,005
<i>And you'll be glad if you do</i>

1193
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:57,341
<i>Their young ones are hungry</i>

1194
01:24:57,342 --> 01:25:00,803
<i>Their nests are so bare</i>

1195
01:25:00,804 --> 01:25:05,433
<i>All it takes is tuppence</i>

1196
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:11,188
<i>From you</i>

1197
01:25:11,189 --> 01:25:14,984
<i>Feed the birds</i>

1198
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:18,195
<i>Tuppence a bag</i>

1199
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:21,699
<i>Tuppence, tuppence</i>

1200
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:25,369
<i>Tuppence a bag</i>

1201
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:28,539
<i>Feed the birds</i>

1202
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:32,168
<i>That's what she cries</i>

1203
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:38,883
<i>While overhead,
her birds fill the skies</i>

1204
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:42,094
<i>All around the cathedral</i>

1205
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:44,722
<i>The saints and apostles</i>

1206
01:25:44,723 --> 01:25:50,895
<i>Look down as she sells her wares</i>

1207
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:54,398
<i>Although you can't see it</i>

1208
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:57,902
<i>You know they are smiling</i>

1209
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:01,530
<i>Each time someone shows</i>

1210
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:07,513
<i>That he cares</i>

1211
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:14,688
<i>Though her words are simple and few</i>

1212
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:18,339
<i>Listen, listen</i>

1213
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:23,302
<i>She's calling to you</i>

1214
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:26,764
<i>Feed the birds</i>

1215
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:30,518
<i>Tuppence a bag</i>

1216
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:34,730
<i>Tuppence, tuppence</i>

1217
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:39,211
<i>Tuppence a bag</i>

1218
01:27:08,807 --> 01:27:15,646
<i>Though her words are simple and few</i>

1219
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:19,108
<i>Listen, listen</i>

1220
01:27:19,109 --> 01:27:24,280
<i>She's calling to you</i>

1221
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:27,533
<i>Feed the birds</i>

1222
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:32,455
<i>Tuppence a bag</i>

1223
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:35,374
<i>Tuppence</i>

1224
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:38,502
<i>Tuppence</i>

1225
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:45,578
<i>Tuppence a bag</i>

1226
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:11,869
Now, remember. Be on
your best behaviour.

1227
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,454
Isn't it your bank?

1228
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:17,291
As a younger officer,
it is, sort of.

1229
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:19,065
Michael, look.

1230
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,963
It's her!

1231
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:25,633
- Who? It's who?
- The bird woman.

1232
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:27,843
Just like Mary Poppins said.

1233
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:29,553
You see her?

1234
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:33,015
Of course I can. Do you think
I can't see past the end of my nose?

1235
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:35,351
Listen, she's saying it.

1236
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:38,229
Feed the birds.

1237
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:39,897
Tuppence a bag.

1238
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:43,150
Of course she's saying it.

1239
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:45,694
- May we feed the birds?
- Whatever for?

1240
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:48,864
- I have tuppence.
- Just this once.

1241
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:52,243
Waste your money on birds?
Certainly not.

1242
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:53,744
But Mary Poppins...

1243
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:59,291
I'm not interested in Mary
Poppins nor in hearing her name.

1244
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:01,335
But it's my tuppence.

1245
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:04,922
Michael, don't throw
your money away!

1246
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:08,926
At the bank, I'll show
you what to do.

1247
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,904
It's extremely interesting.

1248
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:49,592
Hello, Banks.
What's all this about?

1249
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:51,135
My children.

1250
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:53,262
Why are they here?

1251
01:29:53,263 --> 01:29:55,491
They're opening an account, sir.

1252
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:59,143
How much money do you have?

1253
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:02,354
Tuppence. I want it
to feed the birds.

1254
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:04,423
Tuppence!

1255
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:07,318
Tuppence...

1256
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:09,421
Precisely how I started.

1257
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:19,830
That's the elder Mr Dawes,
a giant in the finance world.

1258
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,457
A giant?

1259
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:24,835
Father, these are Banks' children!

1260
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:27,129
They want to open an account!

1261
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:31,201
Do they, boy? Excellent. Excellent.

1262
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:37,454
We can use more money to
put to work for the bank.

1263
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:43,646
You have tuppence?

1264
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:45,731
May I be permitted to see it?

1265
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:48,150
It's for feeding the birds.

1266
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:51,695
Feed the birds and
what have you got?

1267
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:53,781
Fat birds!

1268
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:55,115
But...

1269
01:30:55,116 --> 01:31:01,440
<i>If you invest your
tuppence wisely in the bank</i>

1270
01:31:01,665 --> 01:31:05,815
<i>Safe and sound</i>

1271
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:08,379
<i>Soon that tuppence</i>

1272
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:12,174
<i>Safely invested in the bank</i>

1273
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:16,553
<i>Will compound</i>

1274
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:22,661
<i>And you'll achieve
that sense of conquest</i>

1275
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:28,341
<i>As your affluence expands</i>

1276
01:31:30,026 --> 01:31:37,010
<i>In the hands of the directors</i>

1277
01:31:37,283 --> 01:31:39,910
<i>Who invest</i>

1278
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:46,189
<i>As propriety demands</i>

1279
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:50,022
- May I, sir?
- Carry on, Banks.

1280
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:55,926
You see, Michael, you'll be part
of railways through Africa!

1281
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,678
Exactly.

1282
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,430
Dams across the Nile.

1283
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:03,267
- Talk about the ships.
- Fleets of ocean greyhounds.

1284
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:04,585
Tell them more.

1285
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:07,604
Majestic self-amortizing canals.

1286
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:09,940
It fires the imagination!

1287
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:16,970
<i>Plantations of ripening tea</i>

1288
01:32:18,324 --> 01:32:21,035
<i>All from</i>

1289
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:22,578
<i>Tuppence</i>

1290
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:28,208
<i>Prudently, thriftily,
frugally invested in the...</i>

1291
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:29,918
<i>To be specific</i>

1292
01:32:29,919 --> 01:32:35,049
<i>In the Dawes, Tomes,
Mousley, Grubbs</i>

1293
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:38,074
<i>Fidelity Fiduciary bank</i>

1294
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,148
Give me the money, boy.

1295
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:54,234
I want to feed the birds.

1296
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:55,486
Banks!

1297
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:57,780
Yes, sir. Now, Michael...

1298
01:32:57,781 --> 01:33:02,326
<i>When you deposit tuppence
in a bank account</i>

1299
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:03,452
Go on!

1300
01:33:03,453 --> 01:33:06,397
<i>Soon you'll see</i>

1301
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:07,539
Tell him more!

1302
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:11,543
<i>That it blooms into credit
of a generous amount</i>

1303
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:15,945
<i>Semi-annually</i>

1304
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:21,345
<i>And you'll achieve
that sense of stature</i>

1305
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:26,433
<i>As your influence expands</i>

1306
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:31,188
<i>To the high financial strata</i>

1307
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:34,964
<i>That established credit now commands</i>

1308
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:39,965
You can purchase first
and second trust deeds.

1309
01:33:39,989 --> 01:33:41,740
Imagine the foreclosures,

1310
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:45,619
bonds, chattels, dividends, shares.

1311
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:46,703
Bankruptcies.

1312
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:47,805
Debtor sales.

1313
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:49,248
Opportunities.

1314
01:33:49,249 --> 01:33:51,041
Private enterprise.

1315
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:52,209
Shipyards.

1316
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:53,710
- The mercantile.
- Collieries.

1317
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:54,837
Tanneries.

1318
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:56,713
Corporations, amalgamations.

1319
01:33:56,714 --> 01:33:58,215
Banks!

1320
01:33:58,216 --> 01:34:01,160
While stand the Banks of England,

1321
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:03,404
England stands.

1322
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:12,604
When fall the Banks of England,

1323
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:14,628
England falls!

1324
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:19,550
You see, Michael?

1325
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:21,738
All for the lack of...

1326
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:23,073
<i>Tuppence</i>

1327
01:34:23,074 --> 01:34:24,241
<i>Patiently</i>

1328
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:25,701
<i>Cautiously</i>

1329
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:29,227
<i>Trustingly invested in the...</i>

1330
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:31,248
<i>To be specific</i>

1331
01:34:31,249 --> 01:34:36,253
<i>In the Dawes, Tomes,
Mousley, Grubbs</i>

1332
01:34:36,254 --> 01:34:40,966
<i>Fidelity Fiduciary Bank</i>

1333
01:34:40,967 --> 01:34:44,595
Welcome to our joyful
family of investors.

1334
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:46,013
Give it back!

1335
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:47,431
Give it back!

1336
01:34:47,432 --> 01:34:48,599
Michael, behave...

1337
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,517
Give it to him.

1338
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:54,213
Give me back my money!

1339
01:34:54,856 --> 01:34:57,316
Give me back my money!

1340
01:34:57,317 --> 01:35:00,444
The bank won't give
someone their money.

1341
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:01,888
I'm getting mine.

1342
01:35:01,905 --> 01:35:03,822
Come along, every penny!

1343
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:06,301
And give me mine, too.

1344
01:35:10,413 --> 01:35:11,580
Stop all payments.

1345
01:35:11,581 --> 01:35:13,058
Stop all payments.

1346
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:33,332
Give me my money!

1347
01:35:48,117 --> 01:35:49,409
Children, come back!

1348
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:51,030
- Stop those children!
- Jane! Michael!

1349
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:00,438
Come on!

1350
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:04,534
Stop those children!

1351
01:36:10,014 --> 01:36:11,536
Stop those children!

1352
01:36:13,518 --> 01:36:14,915
Aah!

1353
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:32,494
Come with me.

1354
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:33,642
Granny will hide you!

1355
01:36:43,589 --> 01:36:44,986
Aah!

1356
01:36:49,595 --> 01:36:50,762
Aah!

1357
01:36:50,763 --> 01:36:51,955
Aah!

1358
01:36:52,682 --> 01:36:54,725
Here, half a mo.

1359
01:36:54,726 --> 01:36:56,624
Leave my sister alone.

1360
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:59,088
Your friend won't hurt you.

1361
01:37:01,107 --> 01:37:03,005
Bert, it's you.

1362
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:05,511
In the flesh and at your service.

1363
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:08,280
You're filthy.

1364
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:10,782
Perhaps a smudge.

1365
01:37:10,783 --> 01:37:13,160
It so happens today
I'm a chimney sweep.

1366
01:37:13,161 --> 01:37:15,639
Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.

1367
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:17,998
Don't take on so.

1368
01:37:17,999 --> 01:37:20,943
Bert will take care of you.
Like I was your own father.

1369
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,377
Who's after you?

1370
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:23,420
Father.

1371
01:37:23,421 --> 01:37:24,522
What?

1372
01:37:24,756 --> 01:37:26,608
We went to his bank.

1373
01:37:26,632 --> 01:37:29,952
We must have done
something dreadful.

1374
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:33,243
The police and army were after us.

1375
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:35,265
Michael, don't exaggerate.

1376
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:38,310
There must be some mistake.

1377
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:40,604
Your dad loves you.

1378
01:37:40,605 --> 01:37:44,551
No, not with the look
he had on his face.

1379
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:46,711
He doesn't like us.

1380
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:49,722
That don't seem likely, does it?

1381
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:51,261
It's true.

1382
01:37:53,076 --> 01:37:54,348
Let's sit down.

1383
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,871
Begging your pardon,

1384
01:37:57,872 --> 01:38:01,041
but my heart goes
out to your father.

1385
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:05,192
There he is in that cold,
heartless bank,

1386
01:38:05,254 --> 01:38:08,904
hemmed in by mounds of
cold, heartless money.

1387
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:11,034
I don't like seeing
living things caged up.

1388
01:38:11,844 --> 01:38:13,787
Father in a cage?

1389
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:16,890
Cages come in all sizes and shapes,

1390
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:18,993
even bank-shaped.

1391
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:22,229
Father's not in trouble, we are.

1392
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,458
Sure about that, are you?

1393
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:29,095
You've got your mother
to look after you,

1394
01:38:29,153 --> 01:38:32,928
and Mary Poppins and
Constable Jones and me.

1395
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:35,385
Who looks after your father?

1396
01:38:35,993 --> 01:38:38,995
When something happens,
what does he do?

1397
01:38:38,996 --> 01:38:41,164
Fends for himself, he does.

1398
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:42,437
Who does he tell?

1399
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,209
No one.

1400
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:46,586
Don't blab his troubles.

1401
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:48,439
He pushes on at his job,

1402
01:38:48,464 --> 01:38:51,283
uncomplaining, alone, and silent.

1403
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:53,552
He's not very silent.

1404
01:38:53,553 --> 01:38:55,512
Michael, be quiet.

1405
01:38:55,513 --> 01:38:58,492
Bert, does Father
really need our help?

1406
01:38:59,475 --> 01:39:01,953
It's not my place to say.

1407
01:39:02,478 --> 01:39:06,273
But fathers can always
do with a bit of help.

1408
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:08,251
I'll take you home.

1409
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:19,786
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree</i>

1410
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:23,415
<i>A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be</i>

1411
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:26,585
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo</i>

1412
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:30,005
<i>Good luck will rub off when
I shakes hands with you</i>

1413
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:31,574
<i>Or blow me a kiss</i>

1414
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:35,031
<i>And that's lucky, too</i>

1415
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:41,163
<i>Now as the ladder of
life has been strung</i>

1416
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:44,603
<i>You might think a sweep's
on the bottommost rung</i>

1417
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:48,023
<i>Though I spends me time
in the ashes and smoke</i>

1418
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:51,128
<i>In this whole wide world
there's no happier bloke</i>

1419
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:54,718
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree</i>

1420
01:39:54,739 --> 01:39:58,492
<i>A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be</i>

1421
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:01,578
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo</i>

1422
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:04,398
<i>Good luck will rub off when
I shakes hands with you</i>

1423
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:08,418
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree</i>

1424
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:12,069
<i>A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be</i>

1425
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:15,217
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo</i>

1426
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:18,697
<i>Good luck will rub off when
I shakes hands with you</i>

1427
01:40:23,726 --> 01:40:26,102
Ellen, whoever that is,
send them away.

1428
01:40:26,103 --> 01:40:27,938
I'm dreadfully late.

1429
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:28,980
Yes, mum.

1430
01:40:28,981 --> 01:40:30,298
I'll be leaving.

1431
01:40:30,316 --> 01:40:33,568
Please stay till Father comes home!
Father will feel better

1432
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:35,671
if you shake hands with him.

1433
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:38,865
It's the children, mum.

1434
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:40,617
I thought they were
with their father.

1435
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:43,517
You haven't been
running off, have you?

1436
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:46,206
They haven't exactly been
running away, mum.

1437
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:48,605
They've been frightened and
should be looked after.

1438
01:40:49,126 --> 01:40:52,504
Oh, of course,
Mary Poppins will...

1439
01:40:52,505 --> 01:40:55,006
Oh, no, it's her day off.

1440
01:40:55,007 --> 01:40:56,466
Ellen, would you...

1441
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:59,636
No, mum. I haven't
done me brasses.

1442
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:00,762
Ask Mrs Brill...

1443
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:02,722
Not for 100 quid.

1444
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:06,327
It's baking day,
and you know how cook is.

1445
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:09,789
What about you, sir?

1446
01:41:09,814 --> 01:41:12,508
You've been so kind.

1447
01:41:12,525 --> 01:41:14,192
Me, mum?

1448
01:41:14,193 --> 01:41:17,070
Lord mayor's got a
stopped-up chimney.

1449
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:19,845
How clever of you to know.

1450
01:41:20,157 --> 01:41:21,866
Our drawing room chimney

1451
01:41:21,867 --> 01:41:24,561
is in the most ghastly condition.

1452
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:27,163
Thank you so much.

1453
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:31,690
Besides, it will
amuse the children.

1454
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:33,445
The lord mayor's going
to be terrible put out.

1455
01:41:33,462 --> 01:41:35,046
Thank you so much.

1456
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,798
I do appreciate it.

1457
01:41:36,799 --> 01:41:38,008
I must hurry.

1458
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:41,989
Our gallant ladies in prison are
waiting for me to lead them in song.

1459
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,703
Good-bye, my darlings.

1460
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:55,968
<i>I choose me bristles
with pride, yes, I do</i>

1461
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:57,795
<i>A broom for the shaft</i>

1462
01:41:57,820 --> 01:41:59,922
<i>And a brush for the flue</i>

1463
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:04,977
It's awfully dark and
gloomy up there.

1464
01:42:04,994 --> 01:42:07,973
You see how wrong people can be?

1465
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:13,152
That's a doorway to a
place of enchantment.

1466
01:42:13,169 --> 01:42:17,649
<i>Up where the smoke
is all billowed and curled</i>

1467
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,967
<i>'Tween pavement and stars</i>

1468
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:23,696
<i>Is the chimney sweep world</i>

1469
01:42:24,847 --> 01:42:27,450
<i>When there's hardly no day</i>

1470
01:42:27,642 --> 01:42:29,619
<i>Nor hardly no night</i>

1471
01:42:30,728 --> 01:42:34,423
<i>There's things half in shadow</i>

1472
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:37,001
<i>And halfway in light</i>

1473
01:42:38,235 --> 01:42:42,181
<i>On the rooftops of London</i>

1474
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:47,137
<i>Coo, what a sight</i>

1475
01:42:47,745 --> 01:42:50,394
I wish we could go up there.

1476
01:42:50,414 --> 01:42:52,107
I like chimneys.

1477
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:57,170
Rightly so. A chimney
is a wondrous thing.

1478
01:42:57,171 --> 01:42:59,631
It's built tall up
there on the roof.

1479
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:03,093
The wind blows across her top

1480
01:43:03,094 --> 01:43:05,845
and draws the smoke
right up the flue.

1481
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:09,541
Feel the pull on the
end of that brush.

1482
01:43:09,767 --> 01:43:12,435
It's like you've got a whale
at the end of the line, isn't it?

1483
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:13,708
Michael, be careful.

1484
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:16,382
Things happen around fireplaces.

1485
01:43:18,401 --> 01:43:19,502
Oh, bother.

1486
01:43:22,988 --> 01:43:25,115
Michael!

1487
01:43:25,116 --> 01:43:27,659
Michael, come back down here!

1488
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:30,161
Michael, Michael, where are you?

1489
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:31,605
That's a bit awkward.

1490
01:43:31,789 --> 01:43:34,517
Stop putting ideas in their heads.

1491
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:37,585
There goes another one.

1492
01:43:37,586 --> 01:43:38,670
Shall I go after them?

1493
01:43:38,671 --> 01:43:42,742
They can't gallivant up
there like kangaroos.

1494
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,574
Michael, everything's
going to be...

1495
01:43:52,309 --> 01:43:54,582
Will you put your things on?

1496
01:43:58,399 --> 01:44:00,092
Hurry up. Spit spot.

1497
01:44:00,109 --> 01:44:01,927
Thought you'd left.

1498
01:44:01,944 --> 01:44:03,671
We didn't mean to.

1499
01:44:03,696 --> 01:44:05,363
No harm done.

1500
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:09,264
Truth is, this is a
fortuitous circumstance.

1501
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:10,640
Look there.

1502
01:44:12,037 --> 01:44:16,859
A trackless jungle just
waiting to be explored.

1503
01:44:17,084 --> 01:44:18,168
Why not, Mary Poppins?

1504
01:44:18,169 --> 01:44:20,271
Oh, please, Mary Poppins.

1505
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:26,156
Oh, well... If we must, we must.

1506
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:30,948
Fall in.

1507
01:44:31,474 --> 01:44:33,016
Look lively. Look lively.

1508
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:35,745
Jump to it. Get in line.

1509
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:37,998
Attention!

1510
01:44:38,606 --> 01:44:41,733
Slope arms!

1511
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:44,132
Right turn!

1512
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:53,137
Quick march!

1513
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:24,335
Hello there!

1514
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:32,017
It's just good clean soot, Michael.

1515
01:45:37,748 --> 01:45:38,873
Far as we go, right?

1516
01:45:38,874 --> 01:45:40,271
Not at all.

1517
01:46:30,593 --> 01:46:32,510
What did I tell you?

1518
01:46:32,511 --> 01:46:34,284
The world's at your feet,

1519
01:46:35,806 --> 01:46:37,974
and who sees it but the birds,

1520
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:41,079
the stars, and the chimney sweeps?

1521
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:51,922
Quite nice,

1522
01:46:52,156 --> 01:46:55,180
but we've had enough
night air. Follow me, please.

1523
01:47:06,378 --> 01:47:10,403
<i>Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree</i>

1524
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:12,117
<i>When you're with a sweep</i>

1525
01:47:12,134 --> 01:47:14,612
<i>You're in glad company</i>

1526
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:18,556
<i>Nowhere is there a
more happier crew</i>

1527
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:22,810
<i>Than them what sings
Chim chim cheree, chim cheroo</i>

1528
01:47:22,811 --> 01:47:29,840
<i>Chim chiminy chim chim
Cheree chim cheroo</i>

1529
01:47:30,152 --> 01:47:31,486
Cheroo!

1530
01:47:31,487 --> 01:47:32,570
Cheroo!

1531
01:47:32,571 --> 01:47:33,655
Cheroo!

1532
01:47:33,656 --> 01:47:34,781
Cheroo! Cheroo!

1533
01:47:34,782 --> 01:47:35,929
Cheroo! Cheroo!

1534
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:38,409
It's all me pals!

1535
01:47:38,410 --> 01:47:39,911
Step in time!

01:47:39,912 --> 01:47:41,037
Step in time!

Come on, mateys, step in time!

1541
01:47:51,507 --> 01:47:53,609
Step in time!

1542
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:56,328
<i>Step in time, step in time</i>

01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:02,348
<i>You step in time</i>

1582
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:08,768
Mary Poppins, step in time!

1583
01:50:08,769 --> 01:50:11,964
There you go, Mary Poppins!

1584
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:14,504
Lucky old Bert!

1585
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:22,008
Come on, Mary Poppins!

1586
01:50:25,702 --> 01:50:27,179
Here we go!

1587
01:50:44,721 --> 01:50:46,323
Ain't she marvellous?

1588
01:50:46,348 --> 01:50:47,974
Ain't she beautiful?

1589
01:50:47,975 --> 01:50:49,418
Lovely. Tell your mum.

1590
01:50:51,228 --> 01:50:53,330
Hello, hello, hello!

1591
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:05,138
- More! More!
- Mary, do it again!

1592
01:51:41,069 --> 01:51:42,512
Here we go.

1593
01:52:58,063 --> 01:53:00,022
We're being attacked by Hottentots!

1594
01:53:00,023 --> 01:53:01,148
Aye, aye, sir.

1595
01:53:01,149 --> 01:53:04,026
Cheeky devils! Give them what for!

1596
01:53:04,027 --> 01:53:06,004
Empty the shot lockers!

1597
01:53:06,029 --> 01:53:07,346
Ave, aye, sir!

1598
01:53:13,245 --> 01:53:15,814
Move along, Mr Binnacle.

1599
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:18,184
Teach the beggars a lesson!

1600
01:53:23,547 --> 01:53:25,006
Gun ready, sir.

1601
01:53:25,007 --> 01:53:26,590
Stand by.

1602
01:53:26,591 --> 01:53:27,908
Fire!

1603
01:53:47,738 --> 01:53:49,385
Fire!

1604
01:53:54,619 --> 01:53:55,995
Well hit, sir!

1605
01:53:55,996 --> 01:53:57,518
Very well hit!

1606
01:54:18,018 --> 01:54:19,727
Aah! They're at it again!

1607
01:54:19,728 --> 01:54:21,520
<i>They're at it again, step in time</i>

1608
01:54:21,521 --> 01:54:23,248
<i>At it again, step in time</i>

1609
01:54:26,109 --> 01:54:27,961
<i>They're at it again, step in time</i>

1610
01:54:33,533 --> 01:54:34,950
Ow!

1611
01:54:34,951 --> 01:54:36,452
<i>Ow! Step in time</i>

1612
01:54:36,453 --> 01:54:38,100
<i>Ow! Step in time</i>

1613
01:54:38,121 --> 01:54:39,789
<i>Never need a reason
Never need a rhyme</i>

1614
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:40,998
Whoa!

1615
01:54:40,999 --> 01:54:42,191
<i>Step in time</i>

1616
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:47,606
Oh, Ellen, when you're free...

1617
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:49,817
<i>Votes for women, step in time</i>

1618
01:54:49,841 --> 01:54:51,092
<i>Votes for women, step in time</i>

1619
01:54:51,093 --> 01:54:52,968
Not at the moment.

1620
01:54:52,969 --> 01:54:54,011
<i>Votes for women</i>

1621
01:54:54,012 --> 01:54:55,238
Votes for women!

1622
01:55:07,651 --> 01:55:08,923
It's the master!

1623
01:55:08,985 --> 01:55:10,277
<i>It's the master, step in time</i>

1624
01:55:10,278 --> 01:55:11,445
<i>It's the master</i>

1625
01:55:11,446 --> 01:55:12,763
What's all this?

1626
01:55:12,781 --> 01:55:13,864
What's all this?

1627
01:55:13,865 --> 01:55:15,533
<i>What's all this, what's all this</i>

1628
01:55:15,534 --> 01:55:16,742
<i>What's all this</i>

1629
01:55:16,743 --> 01:55:17,827
<i>Link your elbows, step in time</i>

1630
01:55:17,828 --> 01:55:19,771
What's all this? What's all this?

1631
01:55:19,788 --> 01:55:21,455
<i>Kick your knees up
Kick your knees up...</i>

1632
01:55:21,456 --> 01:55:22,603
Bert.

1633
01:55:26,878 --> 01:55:28,504
Good luck, guv'nor.

1634
01:55:28,505 --> 01:55:30,528
Lovely time.

1635
01:55:30,632 --> 01:55:32,951
Had an elegant time, guv'nor.

1636
01:55:39,307 --> 01:55:40,704
Good luck, guv'nor.

1637
01:56:20,223 --> 01:56:22,975
Father, every sweep
shook your hand.

1638
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:25,394
You'll be so lucky!

1639
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:26,770
Come along, children. Spit spot.

1640
01:56:26,771 --> 01:56:28,464
One moment, Mary Poppins.

1641
01:56:29,191 --> 01:56:31,009
What's the meaning of this?

1642
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:32,902
I beg your pardon?

1643
01:56:32,903 --> 01:56:35,051
Will you explain all this?

1644
01:56:36,072 --> 01:56:38,616
I'd like to make one thing clear.

1645
01:56:38,617 --> 01:56:39,843
Yes.

1646
01:56:41,203 --> 01:56:43,305
I never explain anything.

1647
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:51,772
Yes? Banks here.

1648
01:56:52,923 --> 01:56:54,741
Mr Dawes...

1649
01:56:54,841 --> 01:56:57,051
I'm dreadfully sorry about
what happened today.

1650
01:56:57,052 --> 01:56:59,575
I can assure you that...

1651
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:01,531
Tonight, sir?

1652
01:57:01,806 --> 01:57:05,059
Yes. We'll expect you
at 9:00 precisely.

1653
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:06,143
Without fail.

1654
01:57:06,144 --> 01:57:07,917
Without fail.

1655
01:57:09,397 --> 01:57:11,090
Why, yes, Banks.

1656
01:57:11,525 --> 01:57:13,317
It's extremely serious.

1657
01:57:13,318 --> 01:57:15,528
We regret this action.

1658
01:57:15,529 --> 01:57:16,904
We regret this action.

1659
01:57:16,905 --> 01:57:19,929
You've been with us many years...

1660
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:21,659
You've been with us many years...

1661
01:57:21,660 --> 01:57:23,661
As was your father.

1662
01:57:23,662 --> 01:57:25,560
As was your father.

1663
01:57:26,706 --> 01:57:28,499
Yes, Mr Dawes.

1664
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:31,729
I shall be there at 9:00.

1665
01:57:52,482 --> 01:57:56,837
A man has dreams of
walking with giants.

1666
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:02,930
To carve his niche in
the edifice of time.

1667
01:58:04,494 --> 01:58:09,373
<i>Before the mortar of his zeal</i>

1668
01:58:09,374 --> 01:58:13,168
<i>Has a chance to congeal</i>

1669
01:58:13,169 --> 01:58:15,754
The cup's dashed from his lips.

1670
01:58:15,755 --> 01:58:18,028
The flame's snuffed aborning.

1671
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:20,444
He's brought to wrack
and ruin in his prime.

1672
01:58:23,138 --> 01:58:24,847
Life's a rum go, guv'nor.

1673
01:58:24,848 --> 01:58:26,390
That's the truth.

1674
01:58:26,391 --> 01:58:29,643
I think it's Mary Poppins.

1675
01:58:29,644 --> 01:58:31,770
Since she's come,

1676
01:58:31,771 --> 01:58:33,248
things have happened to me.

1677
01:58:33,523 --> 01:58:34,715
Mary Poppins?

1678
01:58:34,733 --> 01:58:36,525
Yes, of course!

1679
01:58:36,526 --> 01:58:40,654
<i>My world was calm</i>

1680
01:58:40,655 --> 01:58:43,008
<i>Well ordered...</i>

1681
01:58:43,033 --> 01:58:44,259
Exemplary.

1682
01:58:45,410 --> 01:58:48,480
<i>Then came this person</i>

1683
01:58:48,538 --> 01:58:51,858
<i>With chaos in her wake</i>

1684
01:58:53,752 --> 01:58:59,089
<i>And now my life's ambitions go</i>

1685
01:58:59,090 --> 01:59:02,160
<i>With one fell blow</i>

1686
01:59:04,179 --> 01:59:10,537
<i>It's quite a bitter pill</i>

1687
01:59:11,645 --> 01:59:13,187
<i>To take</i>

1688
01:59:13,188 --> 01:59:15,507
That Poppins woman did it!

1689
01:59:15,899 --> 01:59:18,067
I know the person... Mary Poppins.

1690
01:59:18,068 --> 01:59:20,216
She's the one what sings...

1691
01:59:20,278 --> 01:59:23,405
<i>A spoonful of sugar</i>

1692
01:59:23,406 --> 01:59:26,950
<i>That is all it takes</i>

1693
01:59:26,951 --> 01:59:30,829
<i>It changes bread and water into</i>

1694
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:32,539
<i>Tea and cakes</i>

1695
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:34,166
That's it exactly!

1696
01:59:34,167 --> 01:59:37,146
Changing bread into cakes, indeed.

1697
01:59:37,212 --> 01:59:40,297
No wonder everything's
higgledy-piggledy.

1698
01:59:40,298 --> 01:59:43,072
<i>A spoonful of sugar</i>

1699
01:59:43,093 --> 01:59:45,537
<i>Goes a long, long way</i>

1700
01:59:46,304 --> 01:59:49,473
<i>Have yourself a healthy helpin'</i>

1701
01:59:49,474 --> 01:59:52,248
<i>Every day</i>

1702
01:59:52,268 --> 01:59:53,936
A healthy helpin' of trouble.

1703
01:59:53,937 --> 01:59:56,855
You know what she did?
I realise it now. She tricked me

1704
01:59:56,856 --> 01:59:58,982
into taking Jane and
Michael to the bank.

1705
01:59:58,983 --> 02:00:01,402
That's how the trouble started.

1706
02:00:01,403 --> 02:00:04,006
Tricked you into that?

1707
02:00:04,072 --> 02:00:05,823
Outrageous!

1708
02:00:05,824 --> 02:00:08,473
A man as important as you?

1709
02:00:08,493 --> 02:00:09,719
Shameful!

1710
02:00:11,454 --> 02:00:15,275
You're a man of high position,

1711
02:00:15,333 --> 02:00:18,437
esteemed by your peers.

1712
02:00:18,712 --> 02:00:22,047
<i>And when your little
tykes are cryin'</i>

1713
02:00:22,048 --> 02:00:25,368
<i>You haven't time to dry their tears</i>

1714
02:00:26,094 --> 02:00:30,074
<i>And see them grateful little faces</i>

1715
02:00:30,098 --> 02:00:33,793
<i>Smilin' up at you</i>

1716
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:36,083
<i>Because their dad</i>

1717
02:00:36,146 --> 02:00:40,672
<i>He always knows just what to do</i>

1718
02:00:40,734 --> 02:00:42,302
I mean, look...

1719
02:00:42,318 --> 02:00:45,012
Like you say, guv'nor...

1720
02:00:45,113 --> 02:00:49,514
<i>You've got to grind, grind, grind</i>

1721
02:00:49,576 --> 02:00:53,120
<i>At that grindstone</i>

1722
02:00:53,121 --> 02:00:55,770
<i>Though childhood slips</i>

1723
02:00:55,874 --> 02:00:58,167
<i>Like sand</i>

1724
02:00:58,168 --> 02:00:59,645
<i>Through a sieve</i>

1725
02:01:01,337 --> 02:01:03,338
<i>And all too soon</i>

1726
02:01:03,339 --> 02:01:06,300
<i>They've up and grown</i>

1727
02:01:06,301 --> 02:01:10,998
<i>And then they've flown</i>

1728
02:01:11,014 --> 02:01:17,622
<i>And it's too late for you to give</i>

1729
02:01:21,024 --> 02:01:26,426
<i>Just that spoonful of sugar</i>

1730
02:01:26,446 --> 02:01:28,219
<i>To help the medicine</i>

1731
02:01:28,823 --> 02:01:30,783
<i>Go down</i>

1732
02:01:30,784 --> 02:01:35,078
<i>The medicine go down</i>

1733
02:01:35,079 --> 02:01:38,123
<i>Medicine go down</i>

1734
02:01:38,124 --> 02:01:39,817
Well, goodbye, guv'nor.

1735
02:01:39,876 --> 02:01:42,320
Sorry to have troubled you.

1736
02:01:55,183 --> 02:01:56,535
Father.

1737
02:01:57,227 --> 02:02:00,080
We're sorry about the tuppence.

1738
02:02:00,104 --> 02:02:02,164
We didn't know it would
cause you so much trouble.

1739
02:02:10,073 --> 02:02:13,302
Here, Father. You can
have the tuppence.

1740
02:02:26,881 --> 02:02:28,858
Will that make
everything all right?

1741
02:02:31,344 --> 02:02:32,821
Thank you.

1742
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:26,953
Come in!

1743
02:05:36,738 --> 02:05:38,181
Take your hat off, Banks.

1744
02:05:52,754 --> 02:05:54,322
Good evening, gentlemen.

1745
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:00,302
Get on with it. Go on.

1746
02:06:00,303 --> 02:06:01,905
Yes, Father.

1747
02:06:05,725 --> 02:06:09,853
In 1773, an official of this bank

1748
02:06:09,854 --> 02:06:12,423
unwisely loaned a
large sum of money

1749
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:14,441
to finance a shipment of tea

1750
02:06:14,442 --> 02:06:16,465
to the American colonies.

1751
02:06:16,778 --> 02:06:18,300
Do you know what happened?

1752
02:06:18,654 --> 02:06:22,908
I do. As the ship lay
in Boston Harbour,

1753
02:06:22,909 --> 02:06:25,558
colonists dressed as Red Indians

1754
02:06:25,828 --> 02:06:28,898
boarded, behaved rudely,

1755
02:06:28,915 --> 02:06:30,642
and threw the tea overboard.

1756
02:06:30,958 --> 02:06:33,752
This made the tea
unsuitable for drinking,

1757
02:06:33,753 --> 02:06:36,322
even for Americans.

1758
02:06:41,052 --> 02:06:42,244
Precisely.

1759
02:06:42,595 --> 02:06:44,697
The loan was defaulted.

1760
02:06:45,264 --> 02:06:48,016
Panic ensued within these walls.

1761
02:06:48,017 --> 02:06:51,166
There was a run on the bank.

1762
02:06:51,187 --> 02:06:53,335
From that time to this,

1763
02:06:53,731 --> 02:06:58,337
there has not been
a run on this bank.

1764
02:06:59,403 --> 02:07:01,096
Until today!

1765
02:07:01,572 --> 02:07:04,972
A run, sir, caused by
the disgraceful conduct

1766
02:07:04,992 --> 02:07:06,639
of your son.

1767
02:07:06,786 --> 02:07:08,354
Do you deny it?

1768
02:07:08,704 --> 02:07:10,477
No, sir.

1769
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:14,645
I shall gladly assume
responsibility for my son.

1770
02:07:18,548 --> 02:07:19,631
Why are you waiting?

1771
02:07:19,632 --> 02:07:21,154
Get on with it.

1772
02:07:21,175 --> 02:07:22,697
Yes, Father.

1773
02:07:41,904 --> 02:07:43,155
No, not that!

1774
02:07:43,156 --> 02:07:44,257
Steady on.

1775
02:08:05,261 --> 02:08:07,489
Do you have anything to say?

1776
02:08:07,930 --> 02:08:10,599
Sir, they do say

1777
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:13,453
that when there's nothing to say,

1778
02:08:13,477 --> 02:08:15,671
all you can say...

1779
02:08:19,483 --> 02:08:20,901
Confound it, Banks!

1780
02:08:20,902 --> 02:08:22,720
Do you have anything to say?

1781
02:08:25,865 --> 02:08:27,824
Just one word, sir.

1782
02:08:27,825 --> 02:08:28,950
Yes?

1783
02:08:28,951 --> 02:08:31,224
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

1784
02:08:33,164 --> 02:08:34,390
What?

1785
02:08:34,498 --> 02:08:37,542
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

1786
02:08:37,543 --> 02:08:38,752
Mary Poppins was right.

1787
02:08:38,753 --> 02:08:40,821
It does make you feel better.

1788
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:44,633
There's no such word.

1789
02:08:44,634 --> 02:08:47,203
It is a perfectly good word.

1790
02:08:47,261 --> 02:08:49,784
Do you know what there's
no such thing as?

1791
02:08:49,805 --> 02:08:54,251
With due respect, there's
no such thing as you!

1792
02:08:56,270 --> 02:08:57,587
Impertinence, sir!

1793
02:08:57,605 --> 02:09:00,754
Would you like to hear
a marvellous joke?

1794
02:09:00,775 --> 02:09:02,377
A real snapper.

1795
02:09:02,443 --> 02:09:04,011
Joke? Snapper?

1796
02:09:04,111 --> 02:09:08,657
Jane and Michael meet
one day on the street.

1797
02:09:08,658 --> 02:09:13,328
Jane says, "I know a man with
a wooden leg named Smith."

1798
02:09:13,329 --> 02:09:17,434
Michael says, "What's the
name of his other leg?"

1799
02:09:20,002 --> 02:09:22,446
The man's gone mad.
Call the guard!

1800
02:09:22,505 --> 02:09:24,547
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

1801
02:09:24,548 --> 02:09:26,424
I'm feeling better!

1802
02:09:26,425 --> 02:09:28,301
Don't strike my father!

1803
02:09:28,302 --> 02:09:31,054
There's the tuppence,
the wonderful, fateful,

1804
02:09:31,055 --> 02:09:33,123
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
tuppence.

1805
02:09:33,849 --> 02:09:35,767
Guard it well. Good-bye!

1806
02:09:35,768 --> 02:09:37,852
Where are you going?

1807
02:09:37,853 --> 02:09:41,898
I might pop through a
chalk pavement picture

1808
02:09:41,899 --> 02:09:45,443
or seize a horse off
a merry-go-round

1809
02:09:45,444 --> 02:09:46,945
or fly a kite.

1810
02:09:46,946 --> 02:09:48,673
Only Poppins knows.

1811
02:09:49,407 --> 02:09:51,283
- Poppins?
- My nanny.

1812
02:09:51,284 --> 02:09:53,682
She sings that ridiculous song.

1813
02:09:53,786 --> 02:09:55,829
<i>A spoonful of sugar</i>

1814
02:09:55,830 --> 02:09:58,206
<i>Makes the medicine go down</i>

1815
02:09:58,207 --> 02:10:00,208
<i>The medicine go down</i>

1816
02:10:00,209 --> 02:10:02,812
<i>The medicine go down</i>

1817
02:10:02,878 --> 02:10:04,104
<i>The medicine...</i>

1818
02:10:05,381 --> 02:10:08,405
Mad as a March hare.

1819
02:10:08,426 --> 02:10:11,325
A wooden leg named Smith.

1820
02:10:13,723 --> 02:10:17,168
A wooden leg named Smith.

1821
02:10:19,437 --> 02:10:21,164
A wooden le...

1822
02:10:35,202 --> 02:10:36,849
Father.

1823
02:10:37,079 --> 02:10:38,726
Father!

1824
02:10:38,748 --> 02:10:40,665
Father, come down!

1825
02:10:40,666 --> 02:10:42,188
Daddy!

1826
02:10:42,209 --> 02:10:45,358
Daddy, come back!

1827
02:10:53,846 --> 02:10:55,388
Wind's come around,

1828
02:10:55,389 --> 02:10:58,493
blowing dead on from the west.

1829
02:11:00,394 --> 02:11:02,667
She doesn't care
what happens to us.

1830
02:11:02,938 --> 02:11:04,397
She only promised to stay

1831
02:11:04,398 --> 02:11:07,251
till the wind changed, right?

1832
02:11:07,943 --> 02:11:09,636
Bring my hat stand, please.

1833
02:11:13,115 --> 02:11:16,139
Mary Poppins, don't you love us?

1834
02:11:19,288 --> 02:11:22,123
What would happen to me

1835
02:11:22,124 --> 02:11:25,728
if I loved all the children
I said goodbye to?

1836
02:11:28,547 --> 02:11:31,758
That's right. George W. Banks,

1837
02:11:31,759 --> 02:11:34,135
17 Cherry Tree Lane.

1838
02:11:34,136 --> 02:11:36,638
About 6'1", I'd say.

1839
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:40,266
Yes, we rang up his
bank first thing.

1840
02:11:40,267 --> 02:11:44,145
We discovered he'd been
discharged last night.

1841
02:11:44,146 --> 02:11:47,565
No telling what he'll do
in a fit of despondency.

1842
02:11:47,566 --> 02:11:49,567
Wouldn't hurt to drag the river.

1843
02:11:49,568 --> 02:11:53,593
There's a spot popular
with jumpers.

1844
02:11:53,656 --> 02:11:55,099
Really, Ellen!

1845
02:11:56,659 --> 02:11:59,786
He seemed to have been
a fine, stable gentleman.

1846
02:11:59,787 --> 02:12:02,857
No hanky-panky.

1847
02:12:02,873 --> 02:12:06,000
Regular habits,
as far as anyone knows.

1848
02:12:06,001 --> 02:12:08,604
<i>The medicine go down</i>

1849
02:12:08,629 --> 02:12:10,255
<i>Just a spoonful...</i>

1850
02:12:10,256 --> 02:12:11,506
It's him!

1851
02:12:11,507 --> 02:12:13,550
Or something similar.

1852
02:12:13,551 --> 02:12:16,905
A little less noise
on the premises.

1853
02:12:16,929 --> 02:12:18,747
I can't understand the inspector.

1854
02:12:20,808 --> 02:12:23,912
<i>Just a spoonful of sugar</i>

1855
02:12:24,019 --> 02:12:26,963
<i>Makes the medicine go down</i>

1856
02:12:26,981 --> 02:12:29,524
You didn't jump in the river.

1857
02:12:29,525 --> 02:12:31,776
How sensible of you.

1858
02:12:31,777 --> 02:12:33,236
It's all right, sir.

1859
02:12:33,237 --> 02:12:35,055
He's been found.

1860
02:12:35,322 --> 02:12:37,516
No, alive,

1861
02:12:37,533 --> 02:12:38,783
or so I presume.

1862
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:40,682
He's kissing Mrs Banks.

1863
02:12:41,495 --> 02:12:43,313
What happened at the bank?

1864
02:12:43,873 --> 02:12:46,833
I've been sacked,
flung into the street.

1865
02:12:46,834 --> 02:12:48,835
<i>A spoonful of sugar</i>

1866
02:12:48,836 --> 02:12:51,504
<i>Makes the medicine go down</i>

1867
02:12:51,505 --> 02:12:55,842
Gone off his crumpet,
that's what he's done.

1868
02:12:55,843 --> 02:12:58,321
Dotty as you please.

1869
02:12:59,096 --> 02:13:01,723
What were you doing in the cellar?

1870
02:13:01,724 --> 02:13:03,667
First, where are the children?

1871
02:13:03,726 --> 02:13:05,727
Jane! Michael!

1872
02:13:05,728 --> 02:13:07,103
Your father's calling.

1873
02:13:07,104 --> 02:13:09,063
It doesn't sound like Father.

1874
02:13:09,064 --> 02:13:10,711
Jane! Michael!

1875
02:13:10,733 --> 02:13:12,835
Run along. Spit spot.

1876
02:13:17,948 --> 02:13:21,222
You won't go,
Mary Poppins, will you?

1877
02:13:21,243 --> 02:13:22,344
Spit Spot.

1878
02:13:33,631 --> 02:13:35,324
He mended it!

1879
02:13:40,721 --> 02:13:41,868
It's wonderful!

1880
02:13:41,889 --> 02:13:44,412
However did you manage it?

1881
02:13:44,433 --> 02:13:47,602
<i>With tuppence for
paper and strings</i>

1882
02:13:47,603 --> 02:13:50,939
<i>You can have your own set of wings</i>

1883
02:13:50,940 --> 02:13:53,213
<i>With your feet on the ground</i>

1884
02:13:53,275 --> 02:13:56,444
<i>You're a bird in flight</i>

1885
02:13:56,445 --> 02:14:00,175
<i>With your fist holding tight</i>

1886
02:14:00,199 --> 02:14:02,097
<i>To the string of your kite</i>

1887
02:14:02,284 --> 02:14:04,807
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

1888
02:14:05,120 --> 02:14:08,724
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

1889
02:14:08,791 --> 02:14:12,293
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

1890
02:14:12,294 --> 02:14:15,614
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

1891
02:14:15,631 --> 02:14:19,406
<i>And send it soaring</i>

1892
02:14:19,468 --> 02:14:22,887
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

1893
02:14:22,888 --> 02:14:26,474
<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

1894
02:14:26,475 --> 02:14:30,625
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite</i>

1895
02:14:32,189 --> 02:14:34,857
A proper kite needs a proper tail.

1896
02:14:34,858 --> 02:14:36,631
That's what I said.

1897
02:14:36,652 --> 02:14:38,754
Go fly a kite.

1898
02:14:40,155 --> 02:14:44,135
No, sir. I don't
mean you personally.

1899
02:14:44,159 --> 02:14:47,787
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

1900
02:14:47,788 --> 02:14:51,017
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

1901
02:14:51,208 --> 02:14:54,419
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

1902
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:58,115
<i>And send it soaring</i>

1903
02:14:58,299 --> 02:15:01,759
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

1904
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:05,239
<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

1905
02:15:05,264 --> 02:15:09,460
<i>Oh, let's go fly a kite</i>

1906
02:15:11,478 --> 02:15:15,208
<i>When you send it flying up there</i>

1907
02:15:15,232 --> 02:15:18,651
<i>All at once you're lighter than air</i>

1908
02:15:18,652 --> 02:15:20,695
<i>You can dance on the breeze</i>

1909
02:15:20,696 --> 02:15:23,845
<i>Over houses and trees</i>

1910
02:15:23,866 --> 02:15:26,435
<i>With your fist holding tight</i>

1911
02:15:27,244 --> 02:15:29,912
<i>To the string of your kite</i>

1912
02:15:29,913 --> 02:15:32,186
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

1913
02:15:32,708 --> 02:15:36,252
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

1914
02:15:36,253 --> 02:15:39,631
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

1915
02:15:39,632 --> 02:15:43,092
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

1916
02:15:43,093 --> 02:15:46,512
<i>And send it soaring</i>

1917
02:15:46,513 --> 02:15:48,890
There you are, Banks.

1918
02:15:48,891 --> 02:15:51,059
Congratulations.

1919
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:52,707
Capital bit of humour.

1920
02:15:52,728 --> 02:15:55,146
"Wooden leg named Smith,"

1921
02:15:55,147 --> 02:15:57,523
or Jones, whatever it was.

1922
02:15:57,524 --> 02:15:59,001
Father died laughing.

1923
02:16:00,653 --> 02:16:02,362
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

1924
02:16:02,363 --> 02:16:05,592
Nonsense. Nothing
to be sorry about.

1925
02:16:05,616 --> 02:16:08,076
Never seen him happier.

1926
02:16:08,077 --> 02:16:10,350
He left an opening
for a new partner.

1927
02:16:10,454 --> 02:16:12,682
Congratulations.

1928
02:16:12,790 --> 02:16:16,334
Thank you very much indeed, sir.

1929
02:16:16,335 --> 02:16:19,921
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

1930
02:16:19,922 --> 02:16:23,132
<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

1931
02:16:23,133 --> 02:16:27,283
<i>Oh, let's go</i>

1932
02:16:28,097 --> 02:16:29,244
<i>Fly a kite</i>

1933
02:16:31,767 --> 02:16:34,791
Awk! That's gratitude for you.

1934
02:16:34,812 --> 02:16:36,938
Didn't even say goodbye.

1935
02:16:36,939 --> 02:16:38,336
No, they didn't.

1936
02:16:38,357 --> 02:16:39,899
Look at them.

1937
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:44,362
They think more of their
father than of you.

1938
02:16:44,363 --> 02:16:46,614
That's as it should be.

1939
02:16:46,615 --> 02:16:48,991
Don't you care?

1940
02:16:48,992 --> 02:16:51,452
Practically perfect people
never permit sentiment

1941
02:16:51,453 --> 02:16:53,037
to muddle their thinking.

1942
02:16:53,038 --> 02:16:54,789
Is that so?

1943
02:16:54,790 --> 02:16:58,459
Mary Poppins, you don't fool me.

1944
02:16:58,460 --> 02:16:59,627
Really?

1945
02:16:59,628 --> 02:17:03,256
Really. I know how you feel.

1946
02:17:03,257 --> 02:17:07,362
If you think I'm keeping
my mouth shut...

1947
02:17:07,886 --> 02:17:11,456
That will be quite
enough, thank you.

1948
02:17:33,537 --> 02:17:35,329
Goodbye, Mary Poppins.

1949
02:17:35,330 --> 02:17:36,773
Don't stay away too long.

1950
02:18:23,545 --> 02:18:26,380
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

1951
02:18:26,381 --> 02:18:30,009
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

1952
02:18:30,010 --> 02:18:33,513
<i>Up to the highest height</i>

1953
02:18:33,514 --> 02:18:37,016
<i>Let's go fly a kite</i>

1954
02:18:37,017 --> 02:18:40,561
<i>And send it soaring</i>

1955
02:18:40,562 --> 02:18:44,148
<i>Up through the atmosphere</i>

1956
02:18:44,149 --> 02:18:47,735
<i>Up where the air is clear</i>

1957
02:18:47,736 --> 02:18:52,406
<i>Oh, let's go</i>

1958
02:18:52,407 --> 02:18:55,636
<i>Fly a kite</i>
