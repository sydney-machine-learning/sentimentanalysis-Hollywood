1
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,484
As in every stone of this size,
there is a flaw.

2
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:39,113
- A flaw?
- The slightest flaw, Your Excellency.

3
00:00:39,197 --> 00:00:41,157
If you look deep into the stone...

4
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:43,284
you will perceive
the tiniest discoloration.

5
00:00:44,118 --> 00:00:46,454
It resembles an animal.

6
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:49,248
- An animal?
- A leaping panther.

7
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,502
Yes. A pink panther.

8
00:00:57,506 --> 00:00:59,467
Come here, Dala.

9
00:01:05,014 --> 00:01:07,642
A gift to your father
from his grateful people.

10
00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:09,977
Someday it will be yours.

11
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:12,521
The most fabulous diamond
in all the world.

12
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:14,523
Come closer.

13
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:06,837
Okay. Thanks a lot, fellas.

14
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,839
Don't forget
to take the wardrobe back.

15
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:10,841
How do you want them,
matte or glossy?

16
00:07:10,883 --> 00:07:12,843
I want it right away.
I'm in a hurry.

17
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:15,387
You can't rush a genius.

18
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:17,473
I'll rush.

19
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:19,850
Now, don't forget
about the wardrobe.

20
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:28,609
What you doing?

21
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:32,571
Where is everybody?

22
00:07:37,243 --> 00:07:39,870
- Hey, you, come out of there!
- Who is it?

23
00:07:39,954 --> 00:07:42,081
Come out of there,
or we'll bust the door in!

24
00:07:42,164 --> 00:07:44,083
Just a minute.

25
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:47,503
- Can I help you?
- Where is he?

26
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:49,547
- Where's who?
- You know who. George Lytton.

27
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,841
He owes me 40 grand,
and nobody welshes on Big Joe.

28
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:55,887
Now, look, Big Joe,
I'm not a bill collector.

29
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:58,557
I'm a photographer.
Just took his picture.

30
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,101
- What kind of a picture?
- Graduation picture.

31
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:03,103
- His what?
- Graduation.

32
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:04,771
Get him!

33
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:47,939
They're worth half a million.
We'll settle for 300,000.

34
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:52,193
I'll do what I can, but
the merchandise is extremely hot.

35
00:09:12,672 --> 00:09:15,133
You stay here.
Come with me.

36
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:29,606
Come on!

37
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,591
- Pardon, madame.
- Certainly.

38
00:09:56,675 --> 00:09:58,760
She's gone down.
Come on!

39
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,540
We must find that woman.

40
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:34,046
- What was that? What'd you say?
- We don't have much of a description.

41
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:39,093
About 5'7", black hair,
wearing a light beige coat.

42
00:10:39,135 --> 00:10:42,346
And the fools let that fence escape.
He might have talked.

43
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,557
- We will catch him.
- We must.

44
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:49,020
We must find that woman. She is our
first positive link with the Phantom.

45
00:10:52,273 --> 00:10:55,109
- Yes?
- Your wife to see you, Inspector.

46
00:10:55,192 --> 00:10:58,279
Send her in, please.
All right, Henri, that will be all.

47
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:06,537
- Hello, my darling.
- My angel.

48
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:00,383
Amber, how are you?

49
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:15,065
Hello, Duchess.
So glad you could come.

50
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:17,859
Have fun, children.
Hello. How are you?

51
00:12:17,943 --> 00:12:21,864
- Hello, darling!
- You ever met Monica?

52
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:24,616
Oh, but of course.
You were stunning in your last film.

53
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:29,830
- What's he say?
- He says hello...

54
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:31,874
and he would like you
to meet his cousin.

55
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:37,713
- His third cousin.
- Oh, well, that makes a difference.

56
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:46,930
- Who's that?
- Princess Dala.

57
00:12:47,014 --> 00:12:49,516
Oh! Excuse me.

58
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:05,908
Yes?

59
00:13:07,951 --> 00:13:09,912
Miss Angela Dunning.

60
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,877
- Yes?
- Your Highness?

61
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,629
Yes.

62
00:13:18,712 --> 00:13:21,089
Well, here I am again,
Your Highness.

63
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:24,134
I was just having a cocktail party,
and I saw you driving by.

64
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:30,557
I just know you'd enjoy it.
Yes, you'd just love it...

65
00:13:42,402 --> 00:13:44,321
Your Highness.

66
00:13:46,156 --> 00:13:47,783
Hello there.

67
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:50,410
I can't tell you
what an honor this is.

68
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:52,996
Everyone's just dying to meet you.

69
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,201
- Good morning, Your Highness.
- Good morning.

70
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:13,828
- You're a wonderful skier.
- Thank you.

71
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,748
Help! Help!

72
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:21,085
Somebody's taking my sleigh.
Amber! My dog.

73
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:24,797
Leave this to me, ma'am.

74
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:33,723
- What happened?
- I don't know.

75
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:37,685
Suddenly there was a man with a gun,
and he took the sleigh and Amber.

76
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:50,240
We'll only be here
for a few days, my darling.

77
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:53,409
It's going to be a wonderful chance
for a beautiful vacation.

78
00:15:56,204 --> 00:15:58,373
Excuse me. I'm...
My leg is caught.

79
00:15:58,456 --> 00:16:00,875
I apologize
for this inconvenience.

80
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,463
Do you know who that was?
That was Sir Charles Lytton.

81
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,507
- Really?
- Yes.

82
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,177
Oh, I am Inspector Clouseau.
This is Madame Clouseau.

83
00:16:15,431 --> 00:16:17,350
All right. Thank you.

84
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,023
Oh, I'm sorry, my darling.

85
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,902
- It's all right, my darling.
- Excuse me, please.

86
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,281
- Do you know that you're really amazing?
- So you've said.

87
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,077
How you can manage
on a police inspector's salary.

88
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,913
How many women could save
enough out of their housekeeping...

89
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,624
to buy such a beautiful
mink coat as this?

90
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,626
Well, it's not easy.

91
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,170
You are a constant
and desirable contradiction.

92
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,840
Oh, I'm simply
a woman in love, my darling.

93
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,508
My darling.

94
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,517
I'm sorry, my darling.
Please excuse me.

95
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,603
It's perfectly all right.

96
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,147
Oh, did I hurt you?
Are you all right?

97
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,940
- Yes, I'm fine.
- You sure?

98
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,735
- Yes, I am.
- My darling, I'm so sorry.

99
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,199
Darling, I have a little business
to conclude with the manager.

100
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,700
Yes?

101
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,580
After which, I'll return
to you immediately.

102
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,582
Bye, darling.

103
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,681
It's all right.

104
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,337
- How did it go?
- Perfectly.

105
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:17,972
Come in.

106
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,606
Her Highness Princess Dala
is concerned about your injuries.

107
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,609
Oh, well, please
thank the princess...

108
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,653
and tell her that there's
nothing to be concerned about.

109
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,697
It's really not too serious.

110
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,074
In that case, Her Highness
has instructed me...

111
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,077
to invite you for dinner
this evening, 8:00 at her chalet.

112
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,872
Thank the princess.
I'd be delighted to come.

113
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,928
I understand you already know
Signor Tucker from Lloyds of London.

114
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,638
- Hello again.
- Hello, old bean.

115
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,600
- Your company insures the Pink Panther.
- Yes, for half a million.

116
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,393
- Pounds?
- Sterling.

117
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,645
The Phantom could not resist
such a prize as the Pink Panther.

118
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,731
He will most certainly
make an attempt.

119
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,567
But when he does, I shall
be waiting for him. Excuse me.

120
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:13,945
If I understand your theory, the
Phantom is one of Miss Dunning's guests.

121
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,239
That is the theory, yes.
I would like to have from you...

122
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:19,159
the names of those guests
and the location of their rooms.

123
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,161
Of course!

124
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,830
I assume that the Princess Dala
has the jewel with her.

125
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,916
She'd only tell me
it was in a safe place.

126
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:28,877
I suppose if it isn't here,
it's at her villa in Rome.

127
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,879
My men are watching that villa.

128
00:19:30,962 --> 00:19:33,882
With such foresight and planning,
how can the Phantom succeed?

129
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:37,010
With such foresight and planning,
he's already succeeded for 20 years.

130
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,472
It's a mistake to underestimate him,
as the inspector can tell you.

131
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:43,475
The shrewdest, cleverest, most ingenious
criminal in all the world.

132
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,478
- And you have never even seen him?
- Well, I've seen him once.

133
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,773
Five years ago,
I got a fleeting glimpse...

134
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,316
Excuse me.

135
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,610
Got a fleeting glimpse of him
as he made his getaway.

136
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,862
In a strange way,
I also admire that man.

137
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:59,824
He has... how would you say...
a unique flair for the dramatic.

138
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:05,205
- He actually waved good-bye to me.
- Fascinating.

139
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:09,459
But this time, gentlemen,
I shall be waving good-bye to him...

140
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,503
on his way to prison.

141
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,341
Good evening.

142
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,303
- Thank you.
- Make yourself comfortable.

143
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,973
Her Highness will join you in a moment.
May I give you a drink?

144
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,475
Oh, I'd like a brandy,
thank you.

145
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,494
- Oh, Your Highness.
- Good evening, Sir Charles.

146
00:20:43,536 --> 00:20:46,664
Any news from the police
about your dear little dog?

147
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:48,916
They expect I'll receive
a ransom note.

148
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,919
I want you to know I am deeply grateful
for what you tried to do.

149
00:20:52,003 --> 00:20:54,755
Ma'am, it was nothing.

150
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,465
Thank you.

151
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:58,968
- Please sit down.
- Aren't you drinking?

152
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,929
- I don't drink.
- Not ever?

153
00:21:02,013 --> 00:21:06,559
I'm quite content with reality.
I have no need for escape.

154
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,854
I enjoy reality as much as the next man,
but in my case, fortunately...

155
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:12,940
reality includes a good,
stiff belt every now and then.

156
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:16,360
- On the other hand, I don't smoke.
- You're right. It's a nasty habit.

157
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:19,697
Here's to all those nasty little habits
that we hold so dear.

158
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,700
I beg your pardon?

159
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:26,412
Well, let's just say
in this case it means...

160
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:29,290
your health and thank you
for inviting me to dinner.

161
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:33,336
It's not often I have the chance
to dine alone with a beautiful princess.

162
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:37,632
I hate to disappoint you, Sir Charles,
but I'm afraid this isn't the night.

163
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:42,386
- But I understood that...
- We're having dinner, but not alone.

164
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:55,566
At last! Hello! We've been through
icicles up to our you-know-whats!

165
00:21:55,608 --> 00:21:57,693
Oh, Your Highness!

166
00:21:57,777 --> 00:22:02,156
I think it's just too darling of you
to invite me here tonight.

167
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,992
- You've just made Cortina for me.
- Hello, lover.

168
00:22:05,076 --> 00:22:10,414
Oh, hello, dear boy.
Now, don't you move a muscle, darling.

169
00:22:10,456 --> 00:22:15,294
Isn't he wonderful, Your Highness?
Such a magnificent sacrifice.

170
00:22:19,382 --> 00:22:21,300
Good evening, sir.

171
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:55,210
- May I have a cigarette, my darling?
- Yes, of course, my darling.

172
00:22:56,753 --> 00:22:59,089
- There you are, my love.
- Thank you.

173
00:23:01,675 --> 00:23:04,052
- Yes, sir?
- Scotch on the rocks.

174
00:23:08,265 --> 00:23:10,851
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

175
00:23:10,934 --> 00:23:13,353
Thank you very much.

176
00:23:13,395 --> 00:23:16,982
Say, I'm looking for my uncle,
Sir Charles Lytton.

177
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:20,819
- Darling.
- May I get you some water?

178
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:26,450
- Hold your hands over your head.
- Yes, my darling. Bend forward.

179
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:29,661
- Oh, darling, I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

180
00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:32,122
Are you all right, my darling?

181
00:23:32,206 --> 00:23:33,707
What?

182
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,959
- My darling?
- I'll be right back.

183
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:38,003
Yes, darling.

184
00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:49,348
Please.

185
00:23:56,605 --> 00:24:01,485
Yes, she's got a cough
in her throat, you know.

186
00:24:07,783 --> 00:24:11,745
And what do you think?
She turned out to be a man!

187
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:13,997
It's true! It's quite true!

188
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:17,209
You know, Your Highness, you really
must let me give you a party.

189
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:21,338
And I can positively guarantee
it'll be a party to end all parties.

190
00:24:21,421 --> 00:24:23,966
- I'm sure it will.
- Perhaps Her Highness has other plans.

191
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:28,136
On the contrary. Sounds like fun.
Will you include Sir Charles?

192
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:33,517
Oh, no. Charles is having a fling
in Capri. He has his own parties.

193
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,061
Yes, I've read about
some of his parties.

194
00:24:36,103 --> 00:24:38,730
They're wonderful.
We call him the juggler.

195
00:24:38,814 --> 00:24:40,941
I've never really known
a man like him.

196
00:24:41,024 --> 00:24:44,736
He can keep ten girls in the air at once
and make each one happy.

197
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,781
Amazing. Sort of
a contemporary Don Juan.

198
00:24:47,823 --> 00:24:49,993
- That's it.
- Ah, but there's a difference.

199
00:24:50,076 --> 00:24:53,580
Sir Charles' predecessor was forced
to climb balconies and fight duels...

200
00:24:53,663 --> 00:24:56,708
and, as I understand it,
keep his women separate and apart.

201
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:00,461
Now, Charles, on the other hand,
drives a Ferrari...

202
00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:03,464
enters with a key
and resorts to collective bargaining.

203
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:06,968
But they both have
something in common.

204
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:10,722
- And what's that, Your Highness?
- Maybe it's best forgotten.

205
00:25:10,805 --> 00:25:12,849
Oh, don't be silly.
Charles doesn't mind.

206
00:25:12,932 --> 00:25:16,603
- Everyone takes a potshot at Charles.
- Go ahead, ma'am, shoot.

207
00:25:16,686 --> 00:25:20,064
Well, it seems to me,
any middle-aged bachelor...

208
00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:23,610
who has never desired
the basic rewards of wife and family...

209
00:25:23,693 --> 00:25:27,155
and finds it necessary to occupy
the major portion of his life...

210
00:25:27,238 --> 00:25:29,157
making one conquest after another...

211
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,785
is trying to prove something
that he can never possibly prove.

212
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:34,954
- And what's that?
- That he's a man.

213
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:37,290
- What?
- Oh, you're joking!

214
00:25:37,332 --> 00:25:40,251
It's somewhat complicated,
but basically sound.

215
00:25:40,335 --> 00:25:43,004
- Well, Charles?
- Not very original.

216
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:46,090
That particular theory has become
rather a tired Freudian cliche.

217
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:49,469
- But true.
- I've never been on the couch.

218
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,971
Not true.
That's part of your problem.

219
00:25:54,057 --> 00:25:57,435
How refreshing to find royalty
possessed of such a perceptive wit.

220
00:25:57,518 --> 00:26:00,313
Well, Charles, you going
to take that lying down?

221
00:26:00,355 --> 00:26:03,650
Yes, as a matter of fact.
Ma'am, my leg is hurting rather badly.

222
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:05,693
May I be excused?

223
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:11,241
- Well, I'll be damned.
- I can't believe it.

224
00:26:11,324 --> 00:26:13,535
- The leg?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

225
00:26:13,618 --> 00:26:17,914
Well, that just goes to prove
there's a first time for everything.

226
00:26:17,997 --> 00:26:19,415
Got a terrific laugh anyway.

227
00:26:27,382 --> 00:26:28,800
Simone!

228
00:27:38,621 --> 00:27:41,790
Jacques, I'm still cold.

229
00:27:41,874 --> 00:27:44,585
Perhaps another blanket,
my darling.

230
00:27:44,627 --> 00:27:46,837
Yes, all right, darling.

231
00:28:22,706 --> 00:28:24,875
There you are, my darling.

232
00:28:28,504 --> 00:28:30,965
- Yes, darling?
- The light.

233
00:28:50,317 --> 00:28:54,113
- What?
- I'm sorry, darling. It doesn't help.

234
00:28:56,532 --> 00:29:00,077
Perhaps a hot glass of milk.

235
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,457
But I think the room service
has finished, my love.

236
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,835
Oh, yes, of course.
I forgot.

237
00:29:06,877 --> 00:29:10,839
You see?
They're all gone now.

238
00:29:10,922 --> 00:29:13,884
Oh, well. No matter.

239
00:29:16,344 --> 00:29:18,263
Well, you see...

240
00:29:20,307 --> 00:29:24,227
if my little pigeon
wants a glass of milk...

241
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:26,229
she shall have one...

242
00:29:28,106 --> 00:29:31,860
even if I have to force them
to open the kitchen.

243
00:29:34,237 --> 00:29:37,032
She shall have milk
wherever she goes, hot or cold.

244
00:29:37,073 --> 00:29:40,327
- Hot.
- Yeah, I know. That's what I said.

245
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:48,251
Open the door.

246
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:31,336
Darling, I need to talk to you.

247
00:30:32,671 --> 00:30:35,924
My darling, I've sent Jacques
for some milk. I only have a moment.

248
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:39,803
- Well, let's make the most of it.
- No! Stop it.

249
00:30:39,886 --> 00:30:42,389
- It was your idea.
- Yes, but you're the wrong...

250
00:30:42,472 --> 00:30:45,725
The wrong what? Man?
You think I was...

251
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:49,271
No. I thought you were exactly
who you are, but I'm too impulsive.

252
00:30:49,354 --> 00:30:51,523
I mean, this is not the right way.

253
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:55,902
- Another time?
- Huh?

254
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,192
- Here you are, my beloved.
- Thank you.

255
00:31:37,153 --> 00:31:39,071
It's all they had.

256
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:42,825
Can't get a thing in this hotel.
I had to force them to give me that.

257
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,493
Never mind.

258
00:31:55,254 --> 00:31:57,965
My darling, lovely darling.

259
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,052
What's wrong?

260
00:32:01,135 --> 00:32:04,680
My darling, your feet
are like two icicles.

261
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,682
Have you been out of bed
or something?

262
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:09,852
No, of course not.

263
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:13,689
Oh, well, anyway,
you warm them on me, eh?

264
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:33,834
This is Princess Dala.
My guests have gone...

265
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,212
and I thought perhaps
you'd come back and have a drink.

266
00:32:36,295 --> 00:32:38,256
I would feel better
if we're friends.

267
00:32:38,297 --> 00:32:43,010
Oh, I would too, and I'd love to come,
but my leg is rather painful.

268
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,555
I'm sorry. Another time.

269
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,723
Why don't you come up here?

270
00:32:47,807 --> 00:32:49,809
Because my leg is only bad
if I walk too much...

271
00:32:49,892 --> 00:32:53,145
and I thought maybe you could do
the walking and I could do the drinking.

272
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:59,694
Unless, of course, you think it would be
indiscreet to come to a man's room.

273
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:04,031
I'll be there in five minutes.
Good-bye, Sir Charles.

274
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,741
Good-bye.

275
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:41,945
Oh, I don't know what's wrong.
I'm just a bundle of nerves.

276
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:45,616
Well, don't worry.
We've solved that problem before.

277
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,242
- You don't mean...
- Of course.

278
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:50,162
- Oh, Jacques, I don't think you should.
- Don't worry, my darling.

279
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:53,790
- I shall do it ever so softly.
- Oh, Jacques, are you sure?

280
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:56,376
My darling, of course.
It's always worked before.

281
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,712
There's no reason
why it should not work now.

282
00:33:58,795 --> 00:34:02,007
You just relax
and leave everything to me.

283
00:34:17,898 --> 00:34:20,984
- Yes, my darling?
- I don't think that's such a good idea.

284
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:24,112
You mean that it's not helping?

285
00:34:24,196 --> 00:34:27,991
I'm afraid not. I think
I'll just take a sleeping pill.

286
00:34:29,576 --> 00:34:32,037
Very well, my darling.
I'll get it for you.

287
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:37,000
And why don't you take one yourself?
I... You need the rest, you know?

288
00:34:38,627 --> 00:34:40,837
Yes, I think perhaps I will, dear.

289
00:35:07,197 --> 00:35:09,116
Here, my darling.

290
00:35:13,203 --> 00:35:15,956
- Thank you, my angel.
- Thank you, my angel.

291
00:35:38,771 --> 00:35:40,565
My poor Jacques.

292
00:35:41,983 --> 00:35:46,863
No matter. When you've seen
one Stradivarius, you've seen them all.

293
00:35:56,623 --> 00:35:58,917
I hadn't realized
it was so late.

294
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,253
Come in, sit down, relax.
Have a nice glass of champagne.

295
00:36:02,337 --> 00:36:05,673
- I told you I don't drink.
- Oh, champagne's not drinking.

296
00:36:05,757 --> 00:36:09,093
That's the minimum of alcohol
and the maximum of companionship.

297
00:36:09,135 --> 00:36:11,137
It's still against my principles.

298
00:36:11,179 --> 00:36:13,598
Oh, that's too bad.
I thought it might break the ice.

299
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,643
- You took me to task rather properly.
- No, thank you.

300
00:36:16,726 --> 00:36:19,187
I thought your analysis
was very perceptive.

301
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:22,232
- But not very polite.
- No, it wasn't.

302
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:24,817
- What made you do it?
- I resented you.

303
00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:28,112
I find it hard to understand
a man of your reputation.

304
00:36:28,154 --> 00:36:30,114
You know, we both
have reputations.

305
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:32,784
Perhaps mine is a little more
highly publicized than yours...

306
00:36:32,825 --> 00:36:35,078
but you have presented the press
with a rather definite image.

307
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:36,871
Yes, I know.

308
00:36:36,955 --> 00:36:38,748
- Well, are you?
- What?

309
00:36:38,831 --> 00:36:41,459
What they call you.
The virgin queen.

310
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:43,795
I'm not the queen.

311
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:47,632
That's only half an answer.

312
00:36:47,674 --> 00:36:50,802
The strong-willed ruler of ten million
people, sitting in her ivory tower...

313
00:36:50,885 --> 00:36:54,597
untouched, unwed
and unapproachable.

314
00:36:55,932 --> 00:36:59,269
If you had known my father,
you would understand me.

315
00:36:59,352 --> 00:37:01,521
He was an absolute ruler.

316
00:37:01,604 --> 00:37:03,773
He governed his people
with an iron hand...

317
00:37:03,856 --> 00:37:06,985
but he gave me a white pony
for my fifth birthday.

318
00:37:07,026 --> 00:37:09,404
He was wrong about many things...

319
00:37:09,487 --> 00:37:12,448
but he made his decisions according
to the ways of his predecessors.

320
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:17,871
I learned the way of the West,
so I've become a little of both...

321
00:37:17,954 --> 00:37:22,000
a paradox... and it is hard
to reconcile the extremes.

322
00:37:22,876 --> 00:37:26,296
Have a glass of champagne.
Does wonders for extremes.

323
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:29,550
It's been known to launch
some lasting friendships.

324
00:37:34,763 --> 00:37:37,600
- Don't you trust me?
- No.

325
00:37:37,683 --> 00:37:41,312
- Are you afraid?
- No.

326
00:37:53,032 --> 00:37:57,453
I was three years old
when I rode my first elephant.

327
00:37:57,536 --> 00:38:02,082
I was six when I went
on my first "safrari"...

328
00:38:04,543 --> 00:38:06,754
"frasari"...

329
00:38:06,837 --> 00:38:09,048
wild animal hunt...

330
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:12,301
and I was ten when I bagged
my first tiger.

331
00:38:13,093 --> 00:38:16,388
But I'll never forget
my lovely little pony.

332
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,224
When did you bag him?

333
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:24,146
Oh, you're making fun again.
You really don't like animals.

334
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,483
Don't trust a man
who doesn't care about animals...

335
00:38:29,276 --> 00:38:31,237
and don't trust an animal...

336
00:38:31,278 --> 00:38:33,906
who doesn't care about people.

337
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:38,035
Why you don't like people?

338
00:38:38,118 --> 00:38:39,745
I like people.

339
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:45,876
That's supposed to be
me who doesn't...

340
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,420
like people, right?

341
00:38:48,462 --> 00:38:50,256
If you say so.

342
00:38:51,298 --> 00:38:55,094
I don't say so.
You say so.

343
00:38:55,177 --> 00:38:57,012
- Right?
- I said so.

344
00:38:57,096 --> 00:39:00,432
And another thing you did,
you didn't tell me the truth.

345
00:39:01,725 --> 00:39:05,104
- About what?
- About champagne. About this.

346
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:10,442
Oh, boy, did you fib.

347
00:39:10,526 --> 00:39:16,282
You said something
about extremes.

348
00:39:16,323 --> 00:39:18,909
It does wonders for them.

349
00:39:18,993 --> 00:39:23,455
It does more than that.
It makes your lips numb.

350
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:27,459
I can't feel them.
Are they still there?

351
00:39:30,629 --> 00:39:32,548
Let's have a look.

352
00:39:35,886 --> 00:39:38,221
You didn't tell me
about that part.

353
00:39:47,105 --> 00:39:49,733
Won't do you any good.
I can't feel it.

354
00:39:54,613 --> 00:39:57,741
Hoisted on your own petard.

355
00:39:57,824 --> 00:40:02,370
Oh, don't try to say that
when you haven't got any lips.

356
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,337
I'm plastered.

357
00:40:11,922 --> 00:40:14,966
- If that's the right expression.
- Yes, that's the right expression.

358
00:40:16,218 --> 00:40:18,637
You're a fraud and a liar...

359
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,432
and you think you are going
to take advantage of me.

360
00:40:22,515 --> 00:40:25,101
Oh, no. You think I am.

361
00:40:25,185 --> 00:40:28,855
I know you are.
That's the plan, isn't it?

362
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:32,984
Feed me champagne...

363
00:40:33,068 --> 00:40:34,986
break down the inhibitions...

364
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,863
and tallyho.

365
00:40:42,744 --> 00:40:44,371
No more virgin queen.

366
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:49,042
Oh, we're all out of champagne.

367
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:51,169
- I'll get another bottle.
- Oh, no!

368
00:40:53,296 --> 00:40:55,757
I prefer to remain conscious...

369
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,720
so I may view the attempted
seduction at firsthand...

370
00:41:00,762 --> 00:41:03,557
because you've got
a surprise coming, Charlie.

371
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:07,811
I got friends in low places.

372
00:41:07,894 --> 00:41:11,356
You make one pass at me,
and I'll sic him on you.

373
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:13,066
Understand?

374
00:41:13,149 --> 00:41:16,611
If he moves a muscle,
attack without mercy.

375
00:41:18,864 --> 00:41:21,116
You see, Charlie?

376
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:24,619
You're outnumbered,
two against one...

377
00:41:24,703 --> 00:41:27,205
and I don't care
if you can juggle.

378
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:42,138
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

379
00:41:42,221 --> 00:41:45,057
Hmm? Cat got your tongue?

380
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:50,438
Got his tongue? Mm-mm.
My friend says he hasn't got it.

381
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,110
- Then, why don't you say something?
- I couldn't think of anything to say.

382
00:41:58,362 --> 00:42:01,324
Why don't you kiss me again?

383
00:42:03,492 --> 00:42:04,577
All right.

384
00:42:12,376 --> 00:42:16,047
You know what, Charlie?
I could feel that one.

385
00:42:18,174 --> 00:42:19,592
Again.

386
00:42:29,518 --> 00:42:34,106
If I were my father,
I'd have you tortured.

387
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:37,401
No. If you were your father...

388
00:42:37,485 --> 00:42:39,654
I doubt very much
if I would have kissed you.

389
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:43,991
Good thinking, Charlie.

390
00:42:44,033 --> 00:42:47,662
Then, now that we've
straightened out who I am...

391
00:42:47,745 --> 00:42:49,705
what are you going
to do about it?

392
00:43:01,384 --> 00:43:05,680
What kind of a friend are you?
You were supposed to attack.

393
00:43:08,683 --> 00:43:11,602
No friends, Charlie.
Now you got me outnumbered.

394
00:43:11,686 --> 00:43:14,814
I thought we were friends.

395
00:43:14,897 --> 00:43:18,192
You are the juggler.
I am the virgin queen.

396
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:20,528
Somebody's got to win.

397
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:23,698
Friends don't act like that.

398
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:27,076
Want to be friends, Charlie,
or want to win?

399
00:43:33,749 --> 00:43:36,294
You really want to know?

400
00:43:51,184 --> 00:43:52,895
What's wrong?

401
00:43:52,978 --> 00:43:56,356
I don't feel...
I think I'm going...

402
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,067
Good-bye, Charlie.

403
00:44:02,613 --> 00:44:04,573
Here, um...

404
00:44:10,704 --> 00:44:13,207
Darling. Dala.

405
00:44:15,209 --> 00:44:18,587
Ma'am? Your Highness!

406
00:45:55,476 --> 00:45:57,687
Oh, thank you. Up.

407
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:01,149
There we are.

408
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,154
Hello, Uncle Charles.

409
00:46:07,572 --> 00:46:08,990
George!

410
00:46:21,085 --> 00:46:25,215
Hello. Good morning.
Listen, what about this nephew?

411
00:46:25,298 --> 00:46:27,550
- How did you find out?
- I met him in the bar last night.

412
00:46:27,634 --> 00:46:29,969
That's what I was trying
to explain to you at the window.

413
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:33,556
- What happened to you?
- Jacques dragged me back to the hotel.

414
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,767
- I looked everywhere for you.
- Well, I looked everywhere for you.

415
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:38,228
In fact, I nearly climbed in bed
with your nephew.

416
00:46:38,311 --> 00:46:42,065
- You what?
- Don't worry. I took care of it.

417
00:46:42,106 --> 00:46:45,276
Well, he had kind of a heavy night. I
almost put the princess in bed with him.

418
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,737
- Really?
- What you got there?

419
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,532
A note to Uncle Charles.

420
00:46:50,615 --> 00:46:53,159
"Dear Uncle Charles,
Don't worry about a thing.

421
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:57,080
I've gone to see the princess
to apologize for last night."

422
00:46:57,121 --> 00:46:59,082
Apologize for what?
Nothing happened.

423
00:46:59,123 --> 00:47:02,585
It must have been rather embarrassing,
expecting to end up with one man...

424
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:04,587
She didn't expect
to wind up with anybody.

425
00:47:04,671 --> 00:47:07,882
She just had a couple glasses
of champagne and had to rest a while.

426
00:47:07,966 --> 00:47:10,927
- Of course.
- Think of him taking over my room.

427
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:13,930
- Well, didn't you know he was coming?
- No. I haven't seen him for years.

428
00:47:13,972 --> 00:47:15,932
But who is he?
What is he?

429
00:47:15,974 --> 00:47:19,686
Well, he is my nephew, really.
He's my late brother's son...

430
00:47:19,769 --> 00:47:22,981
and I've been responsible for him
ever since he was ten years old.

431
00:47:23,064 --> 00:47:25,275
I sent him to all
the best schools in America.

432
00:47:25,316 --> 00:47:27,443
He did very well,
as a matter of fact.

433
00:47:27,485 --> 00:47:29,988
He's just graduated
from college. Look.

434
00:47:34,325 --> 00:47:36,244
Isn't he a bit old for school?

435
00:47:36,327 --> 00:47:38,288
Well, he did two years in the army.

436
00:47:38,371 --> 00:47:41,833
Then he lost another whole year after
that to some strange tropical disease.

437
00:47:41,916 --> 00:47:44,043
Anyway, he's certainly attractive.

438
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,463
There's a slight family resemblance.
Otherwise, we have nothing in common.

439
00:47:47,547 --> 00:47:50,758
He's dedicated to education.
He passed at the top of his class.

440
00:47:50,842 --> 00:47:54,762
Cares nothing about sports,
and he's never once mentioned girls.

441
00:47:54,846 --> 00:47:58,182
Well, he may not mention them, but he's
got a pretty good idea what they are.

442
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,768
In fact, I nearly didn't
get out of here last night.

443
00:48:00,852 --> 00:48:02,313
You're joking.

444
00:48:02,354 --> 00:48:05,149
It was a relief to get back
to Jacques and his fiddle.

445
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:07,484
Still, if we don't do something soon,
he's gonna ruin everything.

446
00:48:07,568 --> 00:48:10,738
- You mean if I don't do something.
- It shouldn't be too difficult.

447
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:13,407
He's just a young man
who's not been out in the world.

448
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,452
That's because he's been spending
all his time in the bedroom.

449
00:48:16,535 --> 00:48:19,330
- I'm surprised at you.
- Oh, I can handle it.

450
00:48:19,413 --> 00:48:21,874
As a matter of fact,
it might be rather intriguing...

451
00:48:21,957 --> 00:48:25,586
particularly if the family resemblance
goes deeper than you think.

452
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,129
I'm envious.

453
00:48:27,213 --> 00:48:30,174
Well, it seems that we're somewhat
in the same spot, my love.

454
00:48:30,216 --> 00:48:33,219
You envy George,
and I envy the princess.

455
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,349
I really don't know
what I'm going to do yet.

456
00:48:38,432 --> 00:48:41,769
I might even go back to college
and get my doctorate.

457
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:43,771
But I'm torn.

458
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:46,190
I feel there's so many things
to be done in the world...

459
00:48:46,232 --> 00:48:49,109
so many backward countries
where I might be useful.

460
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:51,779
I've even been considering
the Peace Corps.

461
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:54,281
You're certainly not
much like your uncle.

462
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:56,200
Well, I don't know
too much about my uncle...

463
00:48:56,283 --> 00:48:58,494
except what I've read
in the newspapers and magazines.

464
00:48:58,577 --> 00:49:01,664
- One certainly mustn't judge by that.
- No?

465
00:49:01,747 --> 00:49:04,875
After all, whatever I am today,
he made it possible.

466
00:49:04,917 --> 00:49:07,878
I guess everyone has
at least one redeeming quality.

467
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,380
Yes.

468
00:49:16,512 --> 00:49:19,223
Good morning, Your Highness.
Hair of the dog.

469
00:49:19,265 --> 00:49:21,475
- May I present Madame Clouseau.
- Good morning.

470
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:24,979
- This is my Americanized nephew George.
- Yes. We met at the bar last night.

471
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:27,731
- How is your cough?
- Oh, it's completely gone. Thank you.

472
00:49:27,773 --> 00:49:31,735
You should have a glass of this. It'll
put everything in its right perspective.

473
00:49:31,777 --> 00:49:35,573
My perspective is excellent this
morning. I see your leg is much better.

474
00:49:35,614 --> 00:49:38,242
Oh, it's a vast improvement, ma'am.
Thank you. Very much better.

475
00:49:38,284 --> 00:49:42,079
We had a wonderful family reunion
last night after we carried you home.

476
00:49:42,121 --> 00:49:43,914
- He's quite a lad.
- So I've discovered.

477
00:49:43,998 --> 00:49:47,710
He's considering the Peace Corps.
Imagine a Lytton in the Peace Corps.

478
00:49:47,793 --> 00:49:50,212
Be careful, or you'll be giving
your family a good name.

479
00:49:50,296 --> 00:49:52,214
- Please sit down.
- No, thank you.

480
00:49:52,298 --> 00:49:54,592
I was on my way to ski
when I ran into Sir Charles.

481
00:49:54,633 --> 00:49:57,887
- Do you ski, Mr. Lytton?
- Ski?

482
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,598
- No, not very well.
- You should learn, George.

483
00:50:00,681 --> 00:50:03,225
If it wasn't for this ropy leg of mine,
I'd take you in hand myself.

484
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:07,605
I'm hardly in your uncle's class,
but I'd be happy to teach you.

485
00:50:07,688 --> 00:50:11,943
I'm sure Madame is an excellent teacher.
She could surely get you started right.

486
00:50:12,027 --> 00:50:13,945
Well, if it wouldn't be
too much trouble, yeah.

487
00:50:14,029 --> 00:50:16,489
Not at all.
It would be a pleasure.

488
00:50:16,573 --> 00:50:19,326
Perhaps you'd like
to come along now.

489
00:50:19,409 --> 00:50:21,620
George, you can't pass up
an invitation like that.

490
00:50:21,661 --> 00:50:24,080
I haven't got the proper clothes,
and I don't have any skis.

491
00:50:24,164 --> 00:50:27,292
Well, the shop will fix you up.
Just charge everything to me.

492
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:30,629
Thanks. Your Highness,
hope to see you again.

493
00:50:30,712 --> 00:50:33,673
If you're back early.
I'm leaving on the afternoon train.

494
00:50:34,674 --> 00:50:36,593
- Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.

495
00:50:36,676 --> 00:50:38,094
- Thanks, Uncle Charles.
- Have fun.

496
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:41,973
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

497
00:50:42,015 --> 00:50:44,643
- Mind her. She knows what she's doing.
- I'm sure she does.

498
00:50:44,726 --> 00:50:46,645
- You're not staying?
- No. We're off to the slopes.

499
00:50:46,728 --> 00:50:49,522
I'll get the door.
So long, Uncle Charles.

500
00:50:49,606 --> 00:50:51,691
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

501
00:50:53,235 --> 00:50:55,987
Just in time. Thank you.
You sure you won't join me?

502
00:50:56,071 --> 00:50:57,656
Quite sure.

503
00:51:01,368 --> 00:51:04,621
- Do you have to leave this afternoon?
- Yes.

504
00:51:04,704 --> 00:51:06,706
Isn't this departure rather sudden?

505
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:09,042
Not at all.
Why do you think so?

506
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:11,586
Well, I just thought that
after last night...

507
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:14,422
My leaving has nothing
to do with last night.

508
00:51:14,506 --> 00:51:17,425
- Hasn't it?
- You don't know me very well.

509
00:51:17,509 --> 00:51:19,928
No, but I thought last night
I was making some progress.

510
00:51:20,011 --> 00:51:22,514
That was champagne,
nothing more.

511
00:51:22,597 --> 00:51:25,600
Well, whatever it was,
it was very interesting.

512
00:51:25,684 --> 00:51:29,312
- I really don't remember.
- That's such an awful old cliche.

513
00:51:29,396 --> 00:51:32,065
- It's true.
- You know, the majority of women...

514
00:51:32,148 --> 00:51:34,609
they have half a glass too much
and let down the barriers a little...

515
00:51:34,693 --> 00:51:36,611
then they wake up in the morning
riddled with guilt...

516
00:51:36,695 --> 00:51:39,614
and think they can reclaim their virtue
by saying, "I don't remember."

517
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:42,701
Are you saying my virtue
is not intact?

518
00:51:42,784 --> 00:51:44,953
- You know it is.
- Then why should I feel guilty?

519
00:51:45,036 --> 00:51:47,289
You're not concerned
about what happened.

520
00:51:47,372 --> 00:51:49,624
You're worried about
what might have happened.

521
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:52,627
That makes you vulnerable.
That makes you a woman.

522
00:51:52,711 --> 00:51:54,629
You're an arrogant fool.

523
00:51:56,381 --> 00:52:00,510
Perhaps. But after what I just said,
a real woman would've slapped my face.

524
00:52:11,938 --> 00:52:14,232
Whew, I'm glad that's over.
Friends again?

525
00:52:14,316 --> 00:52:16,068
Friends.

526
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:19,572
Good. Now the least you can do
is let me take you to the station.

527
00:52:19,614 --> 00:52:21,741
- All right.
- You really have to go, though?

528
00:52:21,824 --> 00:52:24,452
- Yes, I must go.
- Oh, that's too bad.

529
00:52:24,535 --> 00:52:27,038
- Nothing I can say to make you stay?
- Nothing.

530
00:52:27,121 --> 00:52:29,040
- What time do you have to be there?
- 3:00.

531
00:52:29,123 --> 00:52:32,376
3:00 on the dot,
I'll be here, Your Highness.

532
00:52:35,796 --> 00:52:37,215
3:00.

533
00:52:47,058 --> 00:52:49,435
Look, do we have to start
the lessons right away?

534
00:52:49,477 --> 00:52:51,729
That's what we're up here for,
is it not?

535
00:52:51,812 --> 00:52:55,274
I was hoping we could talk
about last night.

536
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:59,445
- We can talk about that later.
- You were more fun in bed.

537
00:52:59,528 --> 00:53:02,532
- Would you do me a favor, Mr. Lytton?
- Sure, if you call me George.

538
00:53:02,615 --> 00:53:05,535
Forget about last night.
I was impetuous.

539
00:53:05,618 --> 00:53:08,371
I had too much to drink, and
I'd just had a fight with my husband.

540
00:53:08,454 --> 00:53:12,166
It might be easy for you to forget, but
I didn't sleep a wink after you left.

541
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:14,502
It was a very frustrating
experience.

542
00:53:14,585 --> 00:53:17,296
I'm afraid that's your problem,
but I wouldn't make any plans.

543
00:53:17,338 --> 00:53:22,426
Oh, I never make any plans. I just
sort of follow my instincts, you know?

544
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:25,471
George, it's four miles
down the mountain...

545
00:53:25,513 --> 00:53:27,473
and I'm a very good skier.

546
00:53:27,515 --> 00:53:31,102
You follow your instincts too closely,
and you're liable to break your neck.

547
00:53:31,185 --> 00:53:34,605
Now, the first things to learn
about skiing are the fundamentals.

548
00:53:34,689 --> 00:53:36,732
Let's see you turn around.

549
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:42,989
It's not as easy as it looks.
Let me give you a hand.

550
00:53:44,282 --> 00:53:48,452
Ah, let's try something easier.
It's a lot easier, honest.

551
00:53:48,536 --> 00:53:51,747
- I told you to watch those instincts.
- I'm busy. You watch them.

552
00:53:51,831 --> 00:53:54,667
- You're abominable.
- Yeah, that's me.

553
00:53:54,709 --> 00:53:58,671
- The Abominable Snowman.
- Now, George, stop it!

554
00:54:02,425 --> 00:54:04,468
Imbecile!

555
00:54:21,069 --> 00:54:22,696
Perhaps we'll meet again.

556
00:54:22,738 --> 00:54:25,199
- Good-bye, Sir Charles.
- Just a minute.

557
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:29,369
- That's him. There he goes.
- Who?

558
00:54:29,411 --> 00:54:32,372
The man who stole your dog,
in that little car.

559
00:55:19,378 --> 00:55:20,796
Whoa!

560
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:24,758
- How's it going?
- Fine. I'm going to miss her.

561
00:55:24,841 --> 00:55:27,469
Let that be a lesson to you. Never
get too involved with your victims.

562
00:55:27,553 --> 00:55:30,389
- Shall we get out in the open?
- No. It's a bit hard here. Come on.

563
00:55:32,808 --> 00:55:37,104
That's good. That's okay.
Right, start. Give it to me now.

564
00:55:45,153 --> 00:55:47,447
- How close are they?
- Now.

565
00:55:47,531 --> 00:55:50,617
- Sorry. Ready?
- Right.

566
00:55:53,078 --> 00:55:56,290
Come on, little doggy.
Here we are.

567
00:55:59,293 --> 00:56:01,253
Look out!

568
00:56:11,722 --> 00:56:13,974
She's got the dog.
I will see you later.

569
00:59:46,855 --> 00:59:51,026
- You have a wonderful smile.
- I have a great deal to smile about.

570
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:53,654
I have Amber back,
and I'm having a wonderful time.

571
00:59:53,737 --> 00:59:55,656
You missed your train.

572
00:59:55,739 --> 00:59:57,658
There's one at midnight
and one in the morning.

573
00:59:57,741 --> 00:59:59,910
Perhaps I should arrange
to have your dog kidnapped again.

574
00:59:59,994 --> 01:00:01,704
Then you'd be bound to stay.

575
01:00:03,038 --> 01:00:05,207
Did you arrange to have her
kidnapped the first time?

576
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:07,293
Of course.

577
01:00:12,506 --> 01:00:16,552
Well, I am willing
to bet you 10,000 francs...

578
01:00:16,594 --> 01:00:19,430
that the Phantom is in Cortina
at this very moment...

579
01:00:19,513 --> 01:00:21,515
even perhaps in this very room.

580
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,934
How exciting.
What do you think, Mr. Tucker?

581
01:00:24,018 --> 01:00:25,936
Oh, I agree with the inspector.

582
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:29,273
You see, 10 of his last 15 victims have
been guests at Angela Dunning's parties.

583
01:00:29,356 --> 01:00:31,984
What are you all talking about?

584
01:00:32,067 --> 01:00:35,613
- The notorious Phantom.
- I'm afraid I've never heard of him.

585
01:00:35,696 --> 01:00:38,240
What little I've read about him,
he seems to be quite a fellow.

586
01:00:38,282 --> 01:00:41,745
Believe me, there are few thieves
who are as clever as the Phantom.

587
01:00:41,828 --> 01:00:44,414
Each theft is completely
different and unique...

588
01:00:44,497 --> 01:00:46,625
classic in its conception.

589
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:49,878
But I thought you were working on
the theory that he does repeat himself.

590
01:00:49,961 --> 01:00:52,714
Only as far as
Angela Dunning's parties are concerned.

591
01:00:52,797 --> 01:00:55,258
However, there is
one other duplication...

592
01:00:55,300 --> 01:01:00,597
but that is his trademark,
his calling card, so to speak.

593
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:03,558
He always leaves
a white monogrammed glove.

594
01:01:03,642 --> 01:01:05,602
Sounds terribly theatrical.

595
01:01:05,644 --> 01:01:09,231
Your Highness, if I were the Phantom,
I'd have chosen my victim already.

596
01:01:09,314 --> 01:01:11,524
Really? And who would that be?

597
01:01:11,608 --> 01:01:15,320
Well, who has the most
fabulous diamond in the world?

598
01:01:15,403 --> 01:01:18,365
- I suppose I do.
- Exactly. The Pink Panther.

599
01:01:18,448 --> 01:01:21,243
Such a prize he could never resist.
He would be bound to try for it.

600
01:01:21,326 --> 01:01:24,871
I'm afraid he'd be disappointed.
The Pink Panther is in my safe at...

601
01:01:24,955 --> 01:01:27,624
Your Highness, please.
Don't say it, not here.

602
01:01:27,666 --> 01:01:29,626
If I'm not being too nosy,
Your Highness...

603
01:01:29,668 --> 01:01:33,171
I read somewhere there was some dispute
over the ownership of the Pink Panther.

604
01:01:33,255 --> 01:01:36,758
It belongs to me.
It was a gift from my late father.

605
01:01:36,841 --> 01:01:39,302
- I shall never surrender it.
- Why should you?

606
01:01:39,344 --> 01:01:41,555
When the present government
seized power...

607
01:01:41,638 --> 01:01:44,432
they claimed the diamond
was the property of the people.

608
01:01:44,516 --> 01:01:48,270
There's even some talk of the
International Court deciding the issue.

609
01:01:48,353 --> 01:01:51,731
Why don't I steal the diamond
and leave that old glove behind?

610
01:01:51,815 --> 01:01:54,693
- You and I could split the insurance.
- All right.

611
01:01:55,652 --> 01:01:59,823
- I feel like dancing. Your Highness?
- I'd love to.

612
01:02:01,533 --> 01:02:05,078
- How about you, madame?
- Yes, of course.

613
01:02:05,161 --> 01:02:08,206
- Your leg is better, Sir Charles.
- What?

614
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:12,377
- I say, your leg is better.
- Oh, yes, much better. Thank you.

615
01:02:13,545 --> 01:02:15,171
You know, Mr. Tucker...

616
01:02:18,884 --> 01:02:21,511
- It's my beer, old man.
- My hand. It burnt...

617
01:02:21,553 --> 01:02:23,013
I'm sorry.

618
01:02:26,516 --> 01:02:27,934
Sit down.

619
01:02:31,855 --> 01:02:34,524
Seems to be working out
better than we expected.

620
01:02:34,566 --> 01:02:36,860
The only thing we've found out
is that it's not here.

621
01:02:36,902 --> 01:02:39,613
You shouldn't have any trouble
discovering exactly where it is.

622
01:02:39,696 --> 01:02:43,325
Her Highness seems
to be completely captivated.

623
01:02:43,408 --> 01:02:45,702
I'd say that's
a considerable exaggeration.

624
01:02:45,785 --> 01:02:49,415
You're either showing a touch of
senility or you need glasses, my love.

625
01:02:49,498 --> 01:02:51,417
When I'm showing
my senility, darling...

626
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,878
you'll be occupying your time
with your grandchildren.

627
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,797
One has to have children
before one has grandchildren.

628
01:02:56,881 --> 01:02:58,633
You wouldn't dare.

629
01:02:58,716 --> 01:03:02,511
Jacques would make a wonderful father.
He has many redeeming qualities.

630
01:03:02,595 --> 01:03:03,846
Name one.

631
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:07,016
He's kind, loyal,
faithful, obedient.

632
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:09,560
You're either married
to a Boy Scout or a Dachshund.

633
01:03:09,644 --> 01:03:13,231
- And he adores me.
- That eliminates the Boy Scouts.

634
01:03:15,107 --> 01:03:16,859
- Good night.
- Thank you.

635
01:03:25,284 --> 01:03:27,453
- You seem to have lost something.
- Yes.

636
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:31,165
- How'd you like to borrow mine?
- Thanks, Uncle Charles, yes.

637
01:03:31,249 --> 01:03:32,667
Madame.

638
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:43,177
- You've been avoiding me.
- That about describes it.

639
01:03:43,261 --> 01:03:46,931
- You know what I've been thinking?
- Yes, that's why I've been avoiding you.

640
01:03:46,973 --> 01:03:50,685
I don't think you were really looking
for me that night in my uncle's bedroom.

641
01:03:50,768 --> 01:03:52,728
- Don't be ridiculous.
- No, I mean it.

642
01:03:52,812 --> 01:03:54,814
Not the way you treated me today.

643
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:56,899
- You know what I think?
- What?

644
01:03:56,983 --> 01:03:58,401
Well...

645
01:03:59,110 --> 01:04:00,570
Oh, yeah.

646
01:04:00,653 --> 01:04:02,947
What do you think, George?

647
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:05,992
Well, I think maybe I was wrong.

648
01:04:10,955 --> 01:04:14,625
I'm sorry I have to leave, but
I must make a very important phone call.

649
01:04:14,709 --> 01:04:17,628
- Can't it wait?
- I'm afraid not.

650
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:19,171
Good night.

651
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:34,520
That's better.

652
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:42,945
Just a quick shower, my love,
and I will be right with you.

653
01:05:06,678 --> 01:05:08,597
One moment, please.

654
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:14,019
Hello...

655
01:05:14,853 --> 01:05:16,188
Inspector Clouseau.

656
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:19,733
Inspector Clouseau,
this is the prefect of police.

657
01:05:19,816 --> 01:05:22,653
- I have information about the Phantom.
- The Phantom?

658
01:05:22,736 --> 01:05:25,197
Yes, you must come at once.
I'm in Brunico.

659
01:05:25,239 --> 01:05:29,201
Brunico, but that's in Brunico.
I mean, that's 30 miles from here.

660
01:05:29,284 --> 01:05:31,161
It is here that I have
discovered the information.

661
01:05:31,245 --> 01:05:34,373
It is imperative you come immediately.
I cannot say more. I am being watched.

662
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:38,377
Yes. I understand, yes.

663
01:05:40,712 --> 01:05:43,840
I'm sorry, my darling.
Important police business.

664
01:05:43,924 --> 01:05:46,134
I will be back with you
as soon as possible.

665
01:05:46,218 --> 01:05:48,845
I understand, my love.

666
01:05:48,929 --> 01:05:51,431
- My darling.
- Yes?

667
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:55,477
I am a husband that must be
envied by all other husbands.

668
01:05:55,561 --> 01:05:58,438
I'm sure no one
ever had a husband like you.

669
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,524
My darling.

670
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:06,113
My darling, don't move.
Don't panic.

671
01:06:06,154 --> 01:06:08,323
All that has happened
is that my hat has caught...

672
01:06:08,407 --> 01:06:12,035
in one of your naughty
little hairpins.

673
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:13,579
Voila.

674
01:06:19,418 --> 01:06:22,254
You know, at times like this...

675
01:06:22,337 --> 01:06:25,215
I wish I was
but a simple peasant.

676
01:06:25,299 --> 01:06:29,469
It's times like this that make me
realize how lucky I really am.

677
01:07:00,835 --> 01:07:03,922
He's gone to Brunico.
Another call about the Phantom.

678
01:07:05,965 --> 01:07:08,218
Well, there's something going on.

679
01:07:08,301 --> 01:07:11,179
I don't quite know what it is,
but there's something wrong.

680
01:07:11,221 --> 01:07:13,181
Do you want to call it off?

681
01:07:13,223 --> 01:07:15,183
I don't know.
I'm considering it.

682
01:07:15,225 --> 01:07:17,810
- Have you considered something else?
- What's that?

683
01:07:17,852 --> 01:07:20,313
The possibility that
you're growing a conscience.

684
01:07:20,355 --> 01:07:23,233
- A conscience? About what?
- The princess.

685
01:07:24,609 --> 01:07:27,111
- You're being ridiculous.
- No, I'm just being a woman.

686
01:07:27,195 --> 01:07:30,448
This time, you've chosen yourself
a fascinating victim.

687
01:07:30,532 --> 01:07:34,661
I suspect you've broken the first rule
and allowed yourself to become involved.

688
01:07:34,702 --> 01:07:36,996
You're being a woman, all right.

689
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:40,542
That's obvious. Competition
always makes a woman obvious.

690
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,963
- Who is it?
- Bellboy.

691
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,759
Wait a minute.

692
01:07:52,095 --> 01:07:54,847
- What is it?
- Flowers.

693
01:08:05,066 --> 01:08:06,901
- George!
- Trick or treat.

694
01:08:06,985 --> 01:08:10,196
- Now, wait a minute.
- I found these growing in the hall.

695
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:16,828
- You get right out of here.
- What kind of hospitality is that?

696
01:08:16,911 --> 01:08:18,872
But, listen, my husband
could be back any minute.

697
01:08:18,913 --> 01:08:22,208
He must be about
halfway to Brunico by now.

698
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:24,502
"You must come to Brunico
immediately, Inspector.

699
01:08:24,586 --> 01:08:27,171
I have information
about the Phantom.

700
01:08:27,255 --> 01:08:30,550
And while you're in Brunico,
waiting for the prefect of police..."

701
01:08:30,592 --> 01:08:32,176
Thank you very much.

702
01:08:32,260 --> 01:08:35,263
"I shall be investigating
your wife."

703
01:08:38,308 --> 01:08:40,643
One never knows, huh?

704
01:08:40,727 --> 01:08:43,187
Perhaps the Phantom
is hiding under the bed?

705
01:08:44,606 --> 01:08:46,190
That's more like it.

706
01:08:46,274 --> 01:08:48,735
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- I'm planning on it.

707
01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:50,904
- Suppose Jacques doesn't go to Brunico?
- Not a chance.

708
01:08:50,945 --> 01:08:52,989
Suppose he finds out the prefect
never really called him?

709
01:08:53,072 --> 01:08:55,867
- Stop this. You must get out of here.
- You are the damnedest woman I ever met.

710
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:57,952
What are you? A sexual yo-yo?
First you jump in my bed.

711
01:08:58,036 --> 01:09:01,080
Then you push me off a mountain. Then
you almost seduce me on the dance floor.

712
01:09:01,122 --> 01:09:04,417
You're terribly attractive,
and I'm naturally...

713
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,461
- But not here.
- Where?

714
01:09:06,502 --> 01:09:08,255
I don't know, but not tonight.

715
01:09:08,339 --> 01:09:10,716
You know what your trouble is?
You just can't make up your mind.

716
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:12,760
- I am married.
- Where's your husband?

717
01:09:12,843 --> 01:09:14,803
Out in 12 feet of snow,
chasing the Phantom.

718
01:09:14,845 --> 01:09:16,430
- That was your idea.
- Sure it was.

719
01:09:16,513 --> 01:09:20,226
But if he was any kind of a man,
he wouldn't have gone.

720
01:09:20,309 --> 01:09:22,853
- Darling.
- Darling?

721
01:09:25,898 --> 01:09:27,816
It's locked.

722
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:36,575
There you are.
Halfway to Brunico, huh?

723
01:09:36,659 --> 01:09:38,077
Angel?

724
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,669
- What do I do?
- Answer the door.

725
01:09:46,752 --> 01:09:48,837
- Simone?
- Yes, dear?

726
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:54,552
- But, Jacques, I thought you were on...
- That phone call was a ruse.

727
01:09:56,262 --> 01:09:59,431
Oh, dear!
Are you hurt, my darling?

728
01:10:01,016 --> 01:10:02,977
I don't recall that being there.

729
01:10:03,018 --> 01:10:06,021
No, it was sent a while ago.
I thought it was from you.

730
01:10:06,063 --> 01:10:08,607
No, it certainly was not from me.

731
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,820
Some very strange things
going on here.

732
01:10:14,029 --> 01:10:15,990
I passed the prefect on the road.

733
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:20,411
- He never made that call.
- No?

734
01:10:23,038 --> 01:10:24,999
There was no card with these?

735
01:10:28,419 --> 01:10:30,754
Why should anybody want me
to go to Brunico?

736
01:10:32,631 --> 01:10:35,175
Oh, my darling. I'm so sorry.

737
01:10:35,259 --> 01:10:37,219
- I was trying to kiss your foot.
- It's all right.

738
01:10:37,261 --> 01:10:39,346
- Let me kiss your face.
- It's all right.

739
01:10:39,388 --> 01:10:41,515
Darling, I'm sorry.
Come here.

740
01:10:41,599 --> 01:10:46,020
That's nice and comfy.
You belong in bed there.

741
01:10:46,061 --> 01:10:48,230
- My darling.
- Listen, dear.

742
01:10:48,314 --> 01:10:51,567
Why don't we go down to the bar
and have a nightcap?

743
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:56,280
Darling, listen,
why don't I have a nice bath?

744
01:10:56,363 --> 01:10:59,366
And afterwards,
we have our lovely, warm bed.

745
01:10:59,408 --> 01:11:02,036
Don't worry about this mess.
We can have it cleaned up later.

746
01:11:02,119 --> 01:11:06,749
- We don't want any more interruptions.
- Would you mind if I bathed first?

747
01:11:06,832 --> 01:11:09,501
Did you not bathe earlier?

748
01:11:09,585 --> 01:11:13,965
Yes, I did, but it would warm me up
and help me to relax.

749
01:11:15,926 --> 01:11:17,886
All right, my darling.
I'll tell you what we'll do.

750
01:11:17,928 --> 01:11:19,971
Like we did in the old days,
when you're in there...

751
01:11:20,055 --> 01:11:21,973
I will come in and
scrub your back for you.

752
01:11:22,057 --> 01:11:24,643
You're so romantic,
but I'll only be a moment.

753
01:12:42,929 --> 01:12:45,974
- Darling?
- Yes?

754
01:12:47,267 --> 01:12:50,770
- Hello, my darling.
- Hello, my darling.

755
01:12:50,854 --> 01:12:54,357
- Why did you draw the curtains?
- Just to keep me warm.

756
01:12:54,441 --> 01:12:57,694
Warm? Warm is one thing.
It must be hell in there.

757
01:12:57,777 --> 01:13:00,071
No, it's wonderful.

758
01:13:00,155 --> 01:13:02,115
Why don't you let me
wash your back for you?

759
01:13:02,199 --> 01:13:06,620
It's already done, darling. As I told
you before, I just want to relax.

760
01:13:06,703 --> 01:13:08,830
We must have no secrets
from one another, my darling.

761
01:13:08,872 --> 01:13:10,832
I know, my darling.

762
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:17,672
I will brush my teeth
and keep you company.

763
01:13:17,714 --> 01:13:19,716
That's sweet of you, my darling.

764
01:13:34,232 --> 01:13:35,316
Hello?

765
01:13:36,943 --> 01:13:40,780
I thought you would like to know
Princess Dala has just checked out.

766
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:43,032
Thank you very much.

767
01:13:45,535 --> 01:13:48,871
Darling, you got rid
of all those naughty little bubbles?

768
01:13:48,913 --> 01:13:51,374
- I beg your pardon?
- You got rid of those little bubbles?

769
01:13:51,415 --> 01:13:52,875
Yes, I did.

770
01:13:57,922 --> 01:13:59,465
Hey, come...

771
01:14:00,424 --> 01:14:02,552
Come out quick.

772
01:14:10,226 --> 01:14:12,436
- Who is it?
- Bellboy.

773
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,438
One minute.

774
01:14:16,023 --> 01:14:17,108
Yes?

775
01:14:17,191 --> 01:14:19,360
- Inspector's violin, ma'am.
- Thank you.

776
01:14:19,443 --> 01:14:22,572
- Madame, the flowers.
- It's nothing. It doesn't matter.

777
01:14:22,655 --> 01:14:24,907
If they found out downstairs,
I'd lose my job.

778
01:14:24,991 --> 01:14:27,910
- Do it in the morning.
- I'll ring for the maid.

779
01:14:39,297 --> 01:14:40,882
- Darling?
- Yes, dear?

780
01:14:40,965 --> 01:14:44,552
- How would you like to wash my back?
- I'd love to, but you see...

781
01:14:44,635 --> 01:14:47,889
I have to... I mean...
Well, I'm cold.

782
01:14:54,478 --> 01:14:57,481
Get the broom.

783
01:15:01,277 --> 01:15:04,113
Come on. Hurry up. Go.

784
01:15:17,835 --> 01:15:20,630
Shan't be a moment, my darling.
I'll just put on my pajamas.

785
01:15:20,713 --> 01:15:24,091
Darling, look. I think
I've got something in my right eye.

786
01:15:24,175 --> 01:15:26,385
- Let me put you in the...
- I mean, my left one. No, this one.

787
01:15:26,469 --> 01:15:29,306
- If you'd come in the light...
- It hurts!

788
01:15:29,348 --> 01:15:32,976
- Stand still. I can't see it.
- It hurts. I cannot open it.

789
01:15:33,018 --> 01:15:37,105
- Stand in the light a moment. Where?
- Here.

790
01:15:37,189 --> 01:15:40,359
- There's absolutely nothing in your eye.
- Nothing? Are you sure?

791
01:15:40,442 --> 01:15:43,362
Only your eye.
That is all that is there.

792
01:15:53,247 --> 01:15:55,582
- What are you doing?
- It broke off.

793
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:58,335
Put it back. We have no time.
He's coming back.

794
01:15:58,377 --> 01:16:01,171
Get under the bed.
Come on. Quick.

795
01:16:03,549 --> 01:16:05,175
Come on.

796
01:16:07,636 --> 01:16:12,724
- Why aren't you in bed, my darling?
- I was... I mean...

797
01:16:12,808 --> 01:16:15,769
I mean, I'm just going to.

798
01:16:17,854 --> 01:16:19,314
I'm cold.

799
01:16:20,357 --> 01:16:24,528
- My Stradivarius.
- The porter just brought it in.

800
01:16:26,822 --> 01:16:30,367
I sent it to the village to be repaired.
I hope they know how to fix plastic.

801
01:16:30,409 --> 01:16:32,286
I hope so too.

802
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:36,039
So far, so good.

803
01:16:36,081 --> 01:16:38,041
We shall see.

804
01:16:42,629 --> 01:16:44,214
Better than ever.

805
01:16:45,257 --> 01:16:47,968
Dear, I doubt if we shall
need it tonight, my love.

806
01:16:48,051 --> 01:16:51,179
I'm sure we won't, darling.

807
01:17:07,863 --> 01:17:08,947
What?

808
01:17:10,532 --> 01:17:12,659
It's very strange.

809
01:17:25,839 --> 01:17:28,759
Why don't you come to bed?

810
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,928
You know,
I don't understand this.

811
01:17:32,512 --> 01:17:33,973
You see...

812
01:17:35,141 --> 01:17:39,062
these footprints...

813
01:17:39,145 --> 01:17:43,983
they were made by shoes...

814
01:17:44,067 --> 01:17:48,279
and they were not
made by feet.

815
01:17:54,327 --> 01:17:56,871
I'll just get up
and turn off the lights.

816
01:18:01,834 --> 01:18:04,671
At last. At last.

817
01:18:04,754 --> 01:18:06,714
Darling, my little...

818
01:18:10,051 --> 01:18:12,512
Darling, what's the matter,
my darling?

819
01:18:12,595 --> 01:18:16,599
It's very strange, my love,
but suddenly I'm freezing cold.

820
01:18:16,683 --> 01:18:20,311
- You're freezing cold?
- The window is open.

821
01:18:20,353 --> 01:18:24,482
The window's open. Sometimes
it's healthy to have fresh air.

822
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:28,319
Healthy is one thing,
but it's hell in here, my love.

823
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:31,573
Ten below zero outside, my darling.

824
01:18:36,119 --> 01:18:37,370
That's better.

825
01:18:45,211 --> 01:18:47,171
- There, my darling.
- Yes?

826
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:52,677
At last!

827
01:19:16,576 --> 01:19:18,578
- Yes?
- I just arrived in town.

828
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,580
No trouble with the police yet.

829
01:19:20,663 --> 01:19:23,666
I understand the princess is expecting
important visitors here tomorrow.

830
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:26,502
- She say anything about leaving?
- Who is this?

831
01:19:40,351 --> 01:19:42,853
- Yes?
- Princess Dala, please.

832
01:19:42,937 --> 01:19:46,106
Her Highness checked out
a short while ago.

833
01:20:59,263 --> 01:21:01,098
Uncle Charles.

834
01:21:38,052 --> 01:21:39,720
What did you say?

835
01:21:39,803 --> 01:21:41,722
I said he could come
as one of the Borgias.

836
01:21:41,805 --> 01:21:43,766
Then he wouldn't have
to explain his cousin.

837
01:21:43,849 --> 01:21:46,310
What's a Borgia?

838
01:21:48,855 --> 01:21:50,273
Good evening.

839
01:21:59,074 --> 01:22:01,201
I mean...

840
01:22:01,243 --> 01:22:04,538
I enjoy champagne in bed
as much as the next man, my angel.

841
01:22:04,579 --> 01:22:08,708
But from now on, perhaps
a more practical approach?

842
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:13,171
I'm sorry, my darling. I just
wanted to surprise you. That's all.

843
01:22:13,255 --> 01:22:17,175
- It's been a night of surprises.
- You can say that again.

844
01:22:17,259 --> 01:22:18,677
It's been...

845
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,889
Anyway, anyway...

846
01:22:22,973 --> 01:22:24,808
- My love?
- Yes?

847
01:22:27,435 --> 01:22:29,396
Shall I say you're not here?

848
01:22:30,564 --> 01:22:33,400
No, it's all right, darling.
I'll answer it.

849
01:22:42,158 --> 01:22:45,036
- Yes!
- Oh, Tucker here, Inspector.

850
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,373
The man who kidnapped the dog
was driving a rented car.

851
01:22:48,456 --> 01:22:51,084
He's been identified
as a man named Artoff.

852
01:22:51,126 --> 01:22:54,296
Now, London informs us
that a man of his description...

853
01:22:54,379 --> 01:22:57,090
is at present employed
by Sir Charles Lytton.

854
01:22:57,132 --> 01:22:59,426
I see. Come up immediately.

855
01:22:59,509 --> 01:23:01,011
- Sir Charles!
- Sir Charles?

856
01:23:01,094 --> 01:23:04,848
He's the Phantom!
I've really got him this time.

857
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,406
Sir Charles?
Open that door.

858
01:23:21,489 --> 01:23:26,077
I know you're in there, Sir Charles.
Open up. This is the police.

859
01:23:26,161 --> 01:23:29,581
- Stand back while I fire.
- No, don't do that, old man.

860
01:23:43,178 --> 01:23:44,512
Jacques knows.

861
01:23:44,596 --> 01:23:48,350
And somebody else. George has
got my do-it-yourself Phantom kit.

862
01:23:48,433 --> 01:23:51,061
I've got to get out of here.

863
01:23:51,144 --> 01:23:54,732
- Well, his clothes are still here.
- Perhaps he's already escaped.

864
01:23:54,815 --> 01:23:57,401
Most unlikely. He doesn't realize
that I am onto him.

865
01:23:57,485 --> 01:23:59,070
Now, listen, old man.

866
01:23:59,153 --> 01:24:02,823
After all, we've no proof that Artoff
was the man driving the Innocente.

867
01:24:02,907 --> 01:24:05,993
Sir Charles is our man.
My every instinct tells me so.

868
01:24:06,035 --> 01:24:08,162
Careful, you fool.
You realize this gun is loaded?

869
01:24:08,204 --> 01:24:11,541
What I must do now is get dressed
and search the rest of the hotel.

870
01:24:19,549 --> 01:24:21,509
- Did you find him?
- No, but he can't be far.

871
01:24:21,551 --> 01:24:24,554
I must dress quickly and get...

872
01:24:28,015 --> 01:24:29,475
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

873
01:24:29,559 --> 01:24:30,893
My coat!

874
01:24:30,977 --> 01:24:33,771
My Surete-Scotland-Yard-type
macintosh! It's gone!

875
01:24:33,854 --> 01:24:35,982
Good evening, Inspector.

876
01:25:14,103 --> 01:25:16,856
- What is it, Saloud?
- Inspector Clouseau.

877
01:25:20,276 --> 01:25:22,695
Your Highness, please
excuse this interruption.

878
01:25:22,778 --> 01:25:27,158
I have news of great importance.
This is Mr. Tucker of Lloyds of London.

879
01:25:27,241 --> 01:25:31,621
- And we have met before.
- I've met her, too, you know.

880
01:25:31,704 --> 01:25:34,040
Yes, I know, but
we are meeting her again now.

881
01:25:34,123 --> 01:25:36,083
What is this news?

882
01:25:36,167 --> 01:25:39,420
Your Highness, I have discovered
the identity of the Phantom.

883
01:25:39,503 --> 01:25:41,547
- You don't say.
- I do say.

884
01:25:41,631 --> 01:25:43,549
- Of course, we're not positive.
- I am positive.

885
01:25:43,633 --> 01:25:45,593
He is, I believe,
at this very moment here in Rome.

886
01:25:45,676 --> 01:25:47,637
- Really?
- Yes.

887
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:50,097
Have you seen or heard
from Sir Charles Lytton?

888
01:25:50,181 --> 01:25:52,767
Not since I left Cortina. Why?

889
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:55,519
Sir Charles and the Phantom
are one and the same.

890
01:25:55,603 --> 01:25:58,689
- You're not serious.
- I am serious.

891
01:25:58,773 --> 01:26:02,945
I can understand how difficult it is
for Your Highness to accept the facts.

892
01:26:02,986 --> 01:26:06,281
Sir Charles is a very
persuasive and attractive man.

893
01:26:06,365 --> 01:26:10,452
He is also Sir Charles Lytton, a man of
considerable influence and reputation.

894
01:26:10,494 --> 01:26:12,454
She's got quite
a point there, you know.

895
01:26:12,496 --> 01:26:15,290
He is a fraud,
and I shall prove it.

896
01:26:15,374 --> 01:26:19,211
Meanwhile, I would like your permission
to surround the house with armed guards.

897
01:26:19,294 --> 01:26:22,047
- I take it the gem is in the villa.
- It is.

898
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:24,841
But as you gentlemen know, I'm having
a rather large party this evening.

899
01:26:24,925 --> 01:26:28,679
I assure you, your guests will
be caused no embarrassment whatsoever.

900
01:26:28,762 --> 01:26:32,391
They will not even be aware that my men
are present in their disguises.

901
01:26:32,474 --> 01:26:34,434
In that case,
you have my permission.

902
01:26:34,518 --> 01:26:35,936
Thank you.

903
01:26:47,823 --> 01:26:50,742
Your Highness, mark my words...

904
01:26:50,826 --> 01:26:55,289
if Sir Charles is foolish enough to
attempt to steal your diamond tonight...

905
01:26:55,372 --> 01:26:59,835
you will be witness to the capture
of the notorious Phantom.

906
01:27:01,378 --> 01:27:02,796
Gentlemen.

907
01:27:19,813 --> 01:27:23,525
- The plans will have to be changed.
- No.

908
01:27:23,609 --> 01:27:27,863
We just have to make sure that
Sir Charles doesn't steal the jewel.

909
01:28:18,665 --> 01:28:20,625
- Hello.
- Hello, Tucker.

910
01:28:20,667 --> 01:28:22,126
- Like a drink?
- No, thank you.

911
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:25,171
I never drink whilst I'm on duty.
You should know that. Never, never.

912
01:28:25,255 --> 01:28:27,632
- Oh, well, cheers.
- Cheers.

913
01:28:27,715 --> 01:28:31,719
- Warm.
- Yes, it must be hell in there.

914
01:28:31,803 --> 01:28:34,639
Bet it's not so good in there.

915
01:28:34,722 --> 01:28:38,977
- Anything suspicious?
- No, nothing to worry about.

916
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:41,563
My men are everywhere,
mingling here, mingling there.

917
01:28:41,646 --> 01:28:43,731
Watching all the time, watching.

918
01:28:49,737 --> 01:28:52,907
How dare you drink whilst on duty!
Who is inside there?

919
01:28:52,991 --> 01:28:55,118
- Sergeant Walter!
- Sergeant Quinn.

920
01:28:55,159 --> 01:28:57,453
Any more behavior like this,
and I'll have your stripes.

921
01:28:57,495 --> 01:29:00,665
Now get out of here
and start mingling again.

922
01:29:04,043 --> 01:29:06,379
That's funny.
That zebra and the stripes?

923
01:29:06,462 --> 01:29:11,175
- Yes, very good, very good.
- Not bad, not bad.

924
01:29:11,259 --> 01:29:13,761
Well, I think I'll mingle.

925
01:29:13,845 --> 01:29:15,305
Right.

926
01:29:31,195 --> 01:29:34,490
Didn't I tell you that I'd make this
the biggest social success of the year?

927
01:29:34,574 --> 01:29:36,159
Certainly you did.

928
01:29:36,242 --> 01:29:39,871
The only thing that worries me is, of
course, what do we do for your next one?

929
01:29:39,954 --> 01:29:44,167
- How can I possibly top this?
- I'm sure you'll think of something.

930
01:29:44,209 --> 01:29:46,961
- Excuse me.
- Of course, love. Have a ball!

931
01:29:47,045 --> 01:29:48,338
Hello, you!

932
01:29:51,883 --> 01:29:53,468
May I see
your invitation, please?

933
01:29:55,303 --> 01:29:56,721
All right.

934
01:30:03,478 --> 01:30:05,980
Wasn't there another gorilla
in a Rolls-Royce?

935
01:30:06,064 --> 01:30:08,233
Yes, probably a rich uncle.

936
01:30:09,943 --> 01:30:12,612
You see, gentlemen?
Perfectly safe.

937
01:30:12,695 --> 01:30:16,992
One cannot be too careful. This party...
All your guests wearing masks.

938
01:30:17,076 --> 01:30:20,454
It was just possible that the Phantom
had already done his work.

939
01:30:20,538 --> 01:30:24,375
Without an invitation, how could
Sir Charles get past your guards?

940
01:30:24,416 --> 01:30:27,211
Where the Phantom is concerned,
Your Highness...

941
01:30:29,171 --> 01:30:30,589
What's wrong?

942
01:30:42,768 --> 01:30:44,937
- What are you doing?
- The question is, what are you doing?

943
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:48,357
- I protest!
- Remove your head at once!

944
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:50,526
Tucker, remove his head.

945
01:30:54,613 --> 01:30:57,783
- Oh, good grief. It's our ambassador.
- Ambassador?

946
01:30:57,867 --> 01:30:59,827
My apologies,
Lord Cravenwood.

947
01:30:59,910 --> 01:31:02,288
The inspector was only acting
with the best of motives.

948
01:31:02,371 --> 01:31:03,789
Your Highness.

949
01:31:10,754 --> 01:31:14,925
Oh, really, Lord Cravenwood,
what would your wife think?

950
01:31:19,638 --> 01:31:21,724
- What's he got that I haven't got?
- George!

951
01:31:21,807 --> 01:31:23,851
- In the flesh.
- What are you doing here?

952
01:31:23,934 --> 01:31:27,271
- Tarzan let me use the car tonight.
- Listen, I've got to talk to you.

953
01:31:27,313 --> 01:31:31,692
You've got to get out of here...
Oh, darling.

954
01:31:31,775 --> 01:31:34,653
Lord Cravenwood, I'm so terribly
sorry about what happened.

955
01:31:34,737 --> 01:31:36,780
You see, I was discussing
important things with Her Highness...

956
01:31:36,864 --> 01:31:40,826
and when I discovered you outside
the library door, naturally, I thought...

957
01:31:44,663 --> 01:31:46,832
- The ambassador.
- Yes, I know.

958
01:31:46,916 --> 01:31:49,460
You know, darling, you haven't
danced with me all evening, my angel.

959
01:31:49,543 --> 01:31:54,215
- Oh, I'm sorry, my darling.
- That's all for now.

960
01:31:58,844 --> 01:32:01,472
Pardon me! I'm lost.

961
01:32:01,555 --> 01:32:06,143
I must have gotten off the main road.
I'm on my way to Frascati.

962
01:32:06,227 --> 01:32:10,064
You'll have to go down the road
about a half mile. You'll see a sign.

963
01:32:10,147 --> 01:32:13,108
Turn right. It'll take you
right to the highway.

964
01:32:32,587 --> 01:32:36,007
Excuse me, dear, but I've got to talk
to Lord Cravenwood. It's very important.

965
01:32:36,049 --> 01:32:38,260
That's okay.
He's making me itch anyway.

966
01:32:38,343 --> 01:32:39,761
Fine.

967
01:32:40,845 --> 01:32:44,307
Now, listen to me. I know what
you're up to, and it won't work.

968
01:32:44,391 --> 01:32:47,018
- You'll ruin everything.
- Excuse me, Your Excellency.

969
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:49,896
May I cut in?
Thank you so much, sir.

970
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:51,898
- Are you having a good time?
- Yes.

971
01:32:51,982 --> 01:32:53,567
- Extremely good time.
- Good.

972
01:33:55,170 --> 01:33:57,339
Fine party, Angela darling.

973
01:33:57,422 --> 01:34:00,425
Wait till you see
the fireworks at midnight.

974
01:34:31,457 --> 01:34:34,335
Hello, old boy.
May I have this dance?

975
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,507
I never learned to dance. I've simply
got natural rhythm, you know.

976
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:41,175
You're quite right.

977
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:47,807
By Jove, that looked...
It is! It's Sir Charles!

978
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:56,232
Tucker!

979
01:34:58,818 --> 01:35:01,779
- Inspector!
- Tucker!

980
01:35:05,283 --> 01:35:06,617
Inspector!

981
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:12,498
Take your filthy hands
off my asp.

982
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:18,880
- Charles?
- Where's the safe?

983
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:20,673
In the library.
George is robbing it.

984
01:35:20,756 --> 01:35:22,383
- Which way?
- Come on.

985
01:35:22,466 --> 01:35:25,261
- But it's not midnight yet.
- They turned the lights out.

986
01:35:25,344 --> 01:35:27,305
Her Highness must have
changed her mind.

987
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:29,473
All right.

988
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:31,434
Be careful.
I can't see a thing.

989
01:35:31,517 --> 01:35:34,103
Tucker? Where are you?

990
01:35:36,105 --> 01:35:38,065
Watch where you're going!

991
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:54,540
It's hell in here.

992
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:02,506
A candle!

993
01:36:04,717 --> 01:36:07,220
- Hey, quick, got a match?
- Oh, yes, sir.

994
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:09,305
Quick, quick.

995
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:30,201
What kind of a candle is this?

996
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,919
In there. George
is in the gorilla suit.

997
01:36:39,002 --> 01:36:41,046
- Gorilla?
- Good luck.

998
01:36:44,091 --> 01:36:46,093
Rule, Britannia

999
01:36:46,176 --> 01:36:48,303
Britannia, rule the waves

1000
01:36:48,387 --> 01:36:52,391
Britons never, never, never
shall be slaves

1001
01:36:52,474 --> 01:36:54,685
Oh, rule, Britannia

1002
01:36:54,768 --> 01:36:56,353
Britannia, rule the waves

1003
01:36:56,436 --> 01:36:59,147
Oh, I say!

1004
01:37:11,326 --> 01:37:15,789
Inspector! Inspector!
Oh, Inspector, Sir Charles is here.

1005
01:40:04,792 --> 01:40:06,586
- George?
- Uncle Charles?

1006
01:40:06,669 --> 01:40:08,588
- Have you got it?
- No, haven't you?

1007
01:40:08,671 --> 01:40:10,798
No, the safe's empty.

1008
01:40:13,426 --> 01:40:15,136
What's that?

1009
01:40:20,266 --> 01:40:22,185
Someone's being highly dishonest.

1010
01:40:22,268 --> 01:40:23,603
Follow me, men.

1011
01:40:27,315 --> 01:40:29,275
You idiots!
They're getting away from us!

1012
01:40:29,359 --> 01:40:33,613
Help me to my feet, someone.
Mr. Tucker! Mr. Tucker!

1013
01:40:33,696 --> 01:40:36,699
After them! Come on, Tucker!

1014
01:41:02,184 --> 01:41:03,894
Come back! It's me!

1015
01:42:00,242 --> 01:42:02,912
Come on now!
Faster! Faster!

1016
01:42:04,747 --> 01:42:08,459
Hurry! What's the matter with you?
Can't you drive this thing faster?

1017
01:42:20,095 --> 01:42:22,973
Tucker, you're wrong.
Come on! Quick!

1018
01:42:23,057 --> 01:42:26,727
I tell you, this is the road
they've gone up.

1019
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:29,897
Don't argue with me! I'm telling you,
I know where they've gone.

1020
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:44,119
Now, George, any idea
how we get out of here?

1021
01:42:44,161 --> 01:42:46,121
I don't know.
I've been all over this place.

1022
01:42:46,163 --> 01:42:48,958
I've been up this street, up that one,
that one. How we gonna get out of here?

1023
01:42:48,999 --> 01:42:50,960
Why don't you try the high road?

1024
01:42:51,001 --> 01:42:53,129
I'll take the high road.
You take the low road.

1025
01:42:53,171 --> 01:42:55,131
- So long, Uncle Charles.
- Ciao, George.

1026
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:30,500
Who taught you
to drive this thing?

1027
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:46,349
- I see them! That's them!
- No, it isn't!

1028
01:44:19,090 --> 01:44:24,512
Then when I was thrown out of college,
I made up my mind.

1029
01:44:24,596 --> 01:44:28,099
I decided to live a little.

1030
01:44:28,183 --> 01:44:30,393
I knew if I continued
my academic endeavors...

1031
01:44:30,435 --> 01:44:33,021
I could depend upon
that check of yours every month.

1032
01:44:33,104 --> 01:44:36,858
You know what I did?
I took a plush Hollywood apartment.

1033
01:44:36,942 --> 01:44:41,738
Surrounded myself with all of
the advantages of a wealthy bachelor.

1034
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:45,200
Then I sent you glowing reports
of a brilliant academic career.

1035
01:44:45,283 --> 01:44:47,410
I suppose a certain
amount of dishonesty...

1036
01:44:47,494 --> 01:44:49,871
is bound to beget
a certain amount of dishonesty.

1037
01:44:54,459 --> 01:44:56,628
- Hey.
- But, Inspector...

1038
01:44:56,711 --> 01:44:59,172
Come on, please.
I have not much time.

1039
01:45:21,153 --> 01:45:23,155
Better be right this time.

1040
01:45:27,118 --> 01:45:29,161
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Inspector.

1041
01:45:29,245 --> 01:45:31,205
- Good morning, Inspector.
- Everything all sharp and shiny?

1042
01:45:32,790 --> 01:45:35,376
Just thought you'd like to know the
trial is all set for tomorrow morning.

1043
01:45:35,459 --> 01:45:38,212
- Shouldn't take too long.
- Well, that sounds encouraging.

1044
01:45:38,296 --> 01:45:42,758
Yes, it's encouraging for me,
but bad for you.

1045
01:45:42,842 --> 01:45:44,302
Have some coffee, Inspector.

1046
01:45:44,343 --> 01:45:48,055
You could save yourself a lot of trouble
if you would tell me where the jewel is.

1047
01:45:48,139 --> 01:45:51,100
Pack in some of that porridge.
It's guaranteed good for sleuthing.

1048
01:45:51,183 --> 01:45:54,395
- You refuse to cooperate?
- We've offered coffee and porridge.

1049
01:45:54,478 --> 01:45:58,065
- It's all that's left.
- I'm glad you're enjoying yourselves.

1050
01:45:58,149 --> 01:46:02,987
Because you're going to be here
for the next 20 years...

1051
01:46:14,999 --> 01:46:16,417
Madame Clouseau.

1052
01:46:21,005 --> 01:46:23,466
- Your Highness.
- Madame.

1053
01:46:23,549 --> 01:46:26,177
Won't you sit down?

1054
01:46:28,387 --> 01:46:30,306
I'll be brief and to the point.

1055
01:46:30,389 --> 01:46:32,433
My husband feels
he has enough evidence...

1056
01:46:32,516 --> 01:46:34,477
to prove that Sir Charles
is the Phantom...

1057
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,562
and to convict George
as his accomplish.

1058
01:46:36,646 --> 01:46:39,565
As I see it,
they only have one chance.

1059
01:46:39,649 --> 01:46:41,651
What is that?

1060
01:46:41,734 --> 01:46:44,654
If Your Highness were
to testify on their behalf...

1061
01:46:44,737 --> 01:46:48,824
Somehow convince the jury that
they didn't even take the diamond.

1062
01:46:48,908 --> 01:46:51,827
- You surprise me, madame.
- I expect to.

1063
01:46:51,911 --> 01:46:56,207
I'm taking the chance you will keep what
I'm about to tell you in confidence.

1064
01:46:56,249 --> 01:47:00,670
- I think I can guess.
- It's not too difficult.

1065
01:47:00,753 --> 01:47:02,922
Being the wife
of Inspector Clouseau...

1066
01:47:03,005 --> 01:47:05,967
you could have been
very helpful to Charles.

1067
01:47:07,052 --> 01:47:08,595
I have been.

1068
01:47:09,346 --> 01:47:12,099
Was stealing my dog
all part of the plan?

1069
01:47:12,182 --> 01:47:15,185
That was the plan.

1070
01:47:15,269 --> 01:47:18,605
But I think you should know
that Charles wanted to call it off.

1071
01:47:43,505 --> 01:47:45,424
You've had it all the time.

1072
01:47:45,507 --> 01:47:48,927
You stole the jewel yourself before the
International Court made its decision.

1073
01:47:48,969 --> 01:47:53,390
I'd gladly sacrifice it to save Charles,
but it's not so simple.

1074
01:47:53,473 --> 01:47:56,143
Couldn't you say you found it
on the grounds or something?

1075
01:47:56,226 --> 01:47:59,563
They'd just claim he dropped it
making his escape.

1076
01:47:59,646 --> 01:48:03,275
No, to save Charles, we must prove
that someone else stole it.

1077
01:48:03,317 --> 01:48:05,277
But we'd never
be able to do that.

1078
01:48:06,695 --> 01:48:08,739
I have an idea.

1079
01:48:11,366 --> 01:48:13,785
The trial is in its third day.

1080
01:48:13,827 --> 01:48:15,871
Seldom in the history
of Italian jurisprudence...

1081
01:48:15,954 --> 01:48:18,749
has a trial created
such intense excitement.

1082
01:48:18,832 --> 01:48:21,960
Thousands of people... It is interesting
to note, most of them women...

1083
01:48:22,044 --> 01:48:25,672
have gathered daily hoping to catch
a glimpse of Sir Charles Lytton...

1084
01:48:25,756 --> 01:48:28,592
the man accused of being
the notorious Phantom.

1085
01:48:28,675 --> 01:48:31,470
The court adjourned yesterday
as the defense requested time...

1086
01:48:31,553 --> 01:48:34,056
to investigate certain
new important evidence...

1087
01:48:34,139 --> 01:48:37,142
and it is rumored that
when the court convenes today...

1088
01:48:37,226 --> 01:48:39,978
the defense will call
a surprise witness.

1089
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:42,814
The defense has only one witness,
Mr. President.

1090
01:48:42,856 --> 01:48:45,442
Would you please call
Inspector Jacques Clouseau to the stand?

1091
01:48:47,527 --> 01:48:48,946
Me, a defense witness?

1092
01:48:50,030 --> 01:48:51,490
Inspector Clouseau?

1093
01:48:51,531 --> 01:48:54,826
Nothing to worry about, my darling.
You'll make fools out of them.

1094
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:08,340
Inspector Clouseau,
you have testified under oath...

1095
01:49:08,423 --> 01:49:12,219
to certain pertinent facts
concerning this case.

1096
01:49:12,302 --> 01:49:14,222
Your testimony
and your testimony alone...

1097
01:49:14,305 --> 01:49:18,268
has been the major factor in casting
suspicion on the defendant.

1098
01:49:18,351 --> 01:49:22,939
Aside from the Phantom himself, you are
the foremost authority on the Phantom.

1099
01:49:24,649 --> 01:49:27,652
I have made
the Phantom my life's work.

1100
01:49:27,735 --> 01:49:30,738
You've testified that the Phantom
has been a frequent guest...

1101
01:49:30,822 --> 01:49:33,283
at the numerous parties
given by Miss Angela Dunning.

1102
01:49:33,366 --> 01:49:34,951
That is correct. Yes.

1103
01:49:35,034 --> 01:49:39,497
You've testified it was either
during or sometime soon afterwards...

1104
01:49:39,581 --> 01:49:42,667
that certain of Miss Dunning's guests
were robbed of their jewels.

1105
01:49:42,750 --> 01:49:43,835
Yes.

1106
01:49:45,378 --> 01:49:48,590
- How many times did this happen?
- Sixteen.

1107
01:49:48,673 --> 01:49:51,885
- Sixteen parties, 16 thefts?
- Yes.

1108
01:49:51,926 --> 01:49:55,388
- And Sir Charles attended all 16?
- All of them.

1109
01:49:55,430 --> 01:49:58,057
And how many of those parties
did you attend, Inspector?

1110
01:49:59,434 --> 01:50:03,897
- All of them.
- Oh, that's very interesting.

1111
01:50:05,315 --> 01:50:07,567
You attended the first party
when the jewels were stolen?

1112
01:50:07,650 --> 01:50:09,235
Yes.

1113
01:50:09,319 --> 01:50:13,239
The jewels were stolen
during or after the party?

1114
01:50:13,281 --> 01:50:14,574
After.

1115
01:50:14,616 --> 01:50:17,202
- You knew they were going to be stolen?
- Well, yes.

1116
01:50:17,285 --> 01:50:21,164
- How did you know?
- That is the Phantom's modus operandi.

1117
01:50:21,247 --> 01:50:23,208
He always works that way.

1118
01:50:24,125 --> 01:50:25,418
Oh, I see.

1119
01:50:27,754 --> 01:50:31,090
Were the same people
always present at each party?

1120
01:50:31,174 --> 01:50:34,302
No, the guest lists varied.

1121
01:50:34,385 --> 01:50:39,766
Outside of Sir Charles, was anybody else
always present at each of these parties?

1122
01:50:42,101 --> 01:50:47,148
Only Sir Charles was present
at each party when there was a robbery?

1123
01:50:47,232 --> 01:50:50,944
- Yes, yes.
- I see.

1124
01:50:50,985 --> 01:50:53,571
- And what about you?
- Me?

1125
01:50:53,655 --> 01:50:56,866
- Yes, you.
- What about me?

1126
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:58,952
- Well, you were there.
- Yes.

1127
01:50:59,035 --> 01:51:01,079
Then Sir Charles was not the only one
who was present at each party.

1128
01:51:03,081 --> 01:51:07,585
- What are you suggesting?
- I'm not suggesting anything yet.

1129
01:51:11,756 --> 01:51:13,550
Inspector Clouseau?

1130
01:51:14,634 --> 01:51:16,386
How much money do you make?

1131
01:51:18,471 --> 01:51:21,267
- What does this got to do with it?
- Well, your salary...

1132
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:24,603
- How much does an inspector get paid?
- You know, I...

1133
01:51:24,645 --> 01:51:28,649
Enough to buy a wife
a $10,000 mink coat?

1134
01:51:28,732 --> 01:51:30,359
No, of course not.

1135
01:51:30,442 --> 01:51:33,946
You're aware that your wife spent $7,000
at Yves St. Laurent only last month?

1136
01:51:35,364 --> 01:51:36,615
What?

1137
01:51:36,657 --> 01:51:40,619
- And two months before that, $4,000.
- That's impossible.

1138
01:51:40,661 --> 01:51:45,082
We know for a fact your wife spent at
least $30,000 on clothes the past year.

1139
01:51:45,165 --> 01:51:49,753
Sir, my wife is very frugal.
She saves out of the housekeeping money.

1140
01:51:54,884 --> 01:51:57,887
$30,000 out of
the housekeeping money.

1141
01:51:57,970 --> 01:51:59,889
We have been
married for ten years.

1142
01:52:02,558 --> 01:52:04,602
About the time that
these robberies began...

1143
01:52:04,685 --> 01:52:07,313
and the notorious Phantom
came into existence, correct?

1144
01:52:07,396 --> 01:52:09,815
Yes! No, not correct!

1145
01:52:09,899 --> 01:52:12,860
Of course, not correct.
Of course...

1146
01:52:12,943 --> 01:52:16,614
All right, wait, wait.
You see...

1147
01:52:18,574 --> 01:52:22,244
- It's not Sir Charles!
- He must be the Phantom!

1148
01:52:22,328 --> 01:52:26,832
- It must be the inspector.
- He's the Phantom!

1149
01:52:26,916 --> 01:52:30,336
- I refuse to believe...
- Now, Inspec...

1150
01:52:56,111 --> 01:52:58,614
No, I'm not the Phantom!
No, no, please! Please!

1151
01:53:07,915 --> 01:53:10,626
- Thank you, darling.
- Thank the princess.

1152
01:53:10,709 --> 01:53:14,046
- Look at that.
- No, no! I'm not the Phantom!

1153
01:53:14,129 --> 01:53:15,923
No, no, no!
I'm not the Phantom!

1154
01:53:16,924 --> 01:53:18,884
We can't just let him rot in prison.

1155
01:53:18,926 --> 01:53:20,886
Oh, it takes years
for people to rot.

1156
01:53:20,928 --> 01:53:25,099
Besides, when the Phantom strikes again,
the inspector will be as free as a bird.

1157
01:53:25,182 --> 01:53:27,602
Want to come to South America, George?
Family rates?

1158
01:53:27,686 --> 01:53:29,896
- I wouldn't miss it, Uncle Charles.
- That's good.

1159
01:53:29,938 --> 01:53:33,650
And who knows, when I retire,
you might take over the business.

1160
01:53:46,621 --> 01:53:51,626
Go back! Go home!
Crazy woman.

1161
01:53:51,710 --> 01:53:54,004
She's the one who tried
to tear off all his clothes.

1162
01:53:54,087 --> 01:53:57,090
- My wife.
- Wife?

1163
01:53:57,173 --> 01:53:59,634
You can thank my mother
for the flowers.

1164
01:53:59,718 --> 01:54:03,430
You're a national hero.
I envy you.

1165
01:54:03,513 --> 01:54:07,934
- I'm going to prison.
- A few years, but after you get out...

1166
01:54:14,065 --> 01:54:15,692
Tell me, Inspector...

1167
01:54:15,775 --> 01:54:18,194
Signor Phantom...

1168
01:54:18,278 --> 01:54:20,280
all those robberies?

1169
01:54:20,363 --> 01:54:22,574
How did you ever manage it?

1170
01:54:25,452 --> 01:54:27,662
Well, you know...

1171
01:54:29,372 --> 01:54:31,333
it wasn't easy.
