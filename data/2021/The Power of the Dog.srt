1
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,416
<i>When my father passed,</i>

2
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,875
<i>I wanted nothing more
than my mother's happiness.</i>

3
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,083
<i>For what kind of man would I be
if I did not help my mother?</i>

4
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,625
<i>If I did not save her?</i>

5
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,833
You're not eating?

6
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:15,750
No.

7
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,333
Have you figured it out yet, fatso?

8
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,333
What?

9
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,416
How many years
since we took over the ranch

10
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,625
from the Old Gent and Old Lady?

11
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,333
Why?

12
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,958
Oh hell, think about it.

13
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,875
You ever try the house bath, Phil?

14
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,041
No, I have not.

15
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,041
Early up tomorrow, brother.
Big old drive.

16
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,166
There's a dead cow.
Keep our cattle away.

17
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,583
- What happened?
- Anthrax. Don't touch.

18
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,083
Well, guess this is it.

19
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,458
What's "it," Phil?

20
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:02,250
What's "it"? All right, fatso,
I'll tell you what "it" is.

21
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,250
Twenty-five years
since our first run together.

22
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,625
Nineteen hundred and nothing.

23
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,916
That's a long time.

24
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,208
Well, not too damn long.

25
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,750
Know what we should do?

26
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,666
What's that?

27
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,125
Go camping again in the mountains
and shoot ourselves some fresh elk liver.

28
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,583
Cook it right there on the coals
like Bronco Henry taught us.

29
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,583
You got a sore gut?

30
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:42,791
No.

31
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,958
You act like it pains you
to hitch two words together.

32
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,583
There'll be 12 for tonight.

33
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,333
Do you what they'd prefer to eat?

34
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,166
They like the fried chicken dinner.

35
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,291
Yes?

36
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,791
I'm going to need your room.

37
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:01,875
All right.

38
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,083
What are you doing?

39
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:10,791
Nothing.

40
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,833
Is that an album?

41
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,666
Not really.

42
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,583
- May I?
- Sure.

43
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,958
- Do you like the mansion?
- Too much to clean.

44
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:31,041
You wouldn't have to clean it.
There would be cleaners.

45
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,583
Oh, she's beautiful.

46
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,583
I like her flowers.

47
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,208
Oh! That's clever, Peter.

48
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,583
They're so lovely.

49
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:48,708
Thanks.

50
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,875
For the tables?

51
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:53,958
Sure.

52
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,541
- I need three chickens. Can you do them?
- All right.

53
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,916
You're gonna have
to move your stuff to the shed.

54
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll make a bed for you on the floor.

55
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,583
Jake.

56
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,208
- He there?
- Nope.

57
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:51,375
Well, we can't wait forever.
The cattle are in the yards, so drink up.

58
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,083
- You gonna say something?
- Nope.

59
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,708
Not without my brother.

60
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:06,875
Where were you?

61
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,625
I couldn't make
the boys hold back forever.

62
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,000
That's fine.

63
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,791
Uh…

64
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,875
Checked the power, and it's held up.
Not coming till morning.

65
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,333
Oh, no, thanks. Phil, they're ready for us
next door at the Red Mill.

66
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,625
Dinnertime, boys.

67
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,250
Let's get a move on.

68
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,708
Twenty-five years ago,
where were you, Georgie Boy?

69
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:34,958
Hmm?

70
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,458
- With you.
- I'll tell you.

71
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,791
A chubby know-nothing
too dumb to get through college.

72
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,291
People helped you, fatso.

73
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,291
One person in particular
taught you and me ranching

74
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,125
so we damn well succeeded.

75
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,000
- Bronco Henry.
- Hmm.

76
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,125
So…

77
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:07,625
So, to us brothers, Romulus and Remus,
and the wolf who raised us.

78
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,458
- Bronco Henry.
- Bronco.

79
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,875
<i>- Il Lupo.</i>
- Bronco.

80
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,333
- Bronco Henry.
- Bronco Henry.

81
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,083
- Boss is leavin'.
- Dinner, boys.

82
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,333
Much obliged.

83
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:39,458
Rose? Rose, play piano for us please.

84
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,708
I can't!

85
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,416
- Play! Play! Play!
- Come on!

86
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,458
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, ma'am. Fine.

87
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,583
I can play the piano.

88
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,041
Well, well…

89
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,791
Ain't them purdy.

90
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,833
"I've never seen a woman
behind the wheel of a car."

91
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:40,291
I said, "Have you never seen
a lady drive a car before?"

92
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,000
He thought the dog was driving.

93
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,500
No. No.

94
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,083
No!

95
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,500
Oh, yeah.

96
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,208
Well…

97
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:54,333
I wonder what little lady made these.

98
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,875
Actually, I did, sir.

99
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,500
My mother was a florist.

100
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,833
So I made them
to look like the ones in our garden.

101
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,916
Oh, well, do pardon me.

102
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:16,041
They're just as real as possible.

103
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,083
Mmm.

104
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,833
All right. Now, gentlemen, look.
See, that's what you do with the cloth.

105
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,500
- It's really just for wine drips.
- Ooh, you got that, boys?

106
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,666
Only for the drips.

107
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,041
Now get us some food.

108
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,416
- Did Bronco ever eat here?
- No, he did not.

109
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,333
So where did you eat?

110
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:21,750
Uh, back then we had herring at the saloon
and a whole lot of alcohol.

111
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,083
Oh.

112
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:28,125
I remember this one time, Bronco made
this wager that he could jump any horse

113
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:32,000
over the tables and chairs of the saloon
piled up in the street.

114
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,416
Well, we chose him a nag all right.

115
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,500
It didn't bother him.

116
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,291
He took off his saddle,

117
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,916
walked the horse
up to the tables and chairs,

118
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,500
talking to him all the while,

119
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,791
stroking his big, ugly head
while the horse sniffed.

120
00:13:53,541 --> 00:14:00,083
And then he swung on
and rode him back and…

121
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:03,833
What?

122
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:08,625
Flew over.

123
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,333
He jumped it?

124
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,541
But to get a nag to jump… ain't heard of.

125
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,458
Put it down to <i>amour.</i>

126
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,083
What do you say, George?

127
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,750
<i>Amour?</i>

128
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:38,125
What… I don't know
what you're talking about.

129
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,500
Do you mind quietening? We're eating.

130
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,541
Shut that down, or I will!

131
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,166
Are you all right, Peter?

132
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,375
Where are you going?

133
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,416
Go on over. I'll settle up.

134
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,416
Settle in the morning.

135
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,833
I'll be along.

136
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,750
Shall I settle up now, Mrs. Gordon, or…

137
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,416
Please, you can…

138
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,625
Send the bill, and I'll post a check.

139
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,666
Come over here. I love you.

140
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:40,791
George?

141
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,666
George?

142
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,083
Brother.

143
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:12,583
Where have you been?

144
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,250
What you said about her boy tonight, Phil…

145
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,750
Made her cry.

146
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,125
She had her ear to the door?

147
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,833
She was crying, Phil.

148
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,333
What the hell?

149
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:42,500
I said her boy needed
to snap out of it and get human.

150
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,958
Pointed it out, that's all.

151
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,375
She should damn well know.

152
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,458
Hold it.

153
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,500
He's got it!

154
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:35,250
He was better before.

155
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,083
He's getting there.

156
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,333
Is that how Bronco Henry learned it?

157
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,708
I never saw him out on a lunge,
that's a fact.

158
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,625
What is it
you see up there, Phil?

159
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:03,958
Are animals up there?

160
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,166
Has anyone else seen
what you've seen, Phil?

161
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,208
George?

162
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:16,333
Nah, not him.

163
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,375
Come on, Phil. What is it?

164
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,750
There is something there, right?

165
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,833
Not if you can't see it, there ain't.

166
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,291
Gotta be an animal.

167
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,250
Hello, Mr. Burbank.

168
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,083
Hello, Mrs. Gordon.

169
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,458
How can I help you?

170
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,958
I really just came to see you.

171
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:39,875
Oh.

172
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:41,750
I'm quite busy.

173
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:02,041
"This most wholesome sauce is excellent

174
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:06,166
with meats, fish, and cheese."

175
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,666
They have wine with them.

176
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:13,833
I wish they wouldn't do that.

177
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:15,625
I don't like drinking.

178
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,583
I'd say they have more in them than wine.
Sounds like booze.

179
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:21,250
They're early.

180
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:23,541
I should have never put
the pianola in there.

181
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,291
Here's the water.

182
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:47,708
I see… I see the Herndon doctor
and the undertaker, Mr. Weltz.

183
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:50,541
Oh, goodness.
I wish Peter were here.

184
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:54,750
He should be serving the salad,
and I need to fry the chicken.

185
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:58,000
Sometimes if you get food on the table…

186
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,208
Um, Mr. Burbank,

187
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,833
I'm gonna run and get Peter.

188
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:15,708
Afternoon!

189
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,916
Uh, looks like I'm the new waiter.

190
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,791
Doctor.

191
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:27,583
Mr. Burbank.

192
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,333
Mr. Weltz.

193
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:21,166
Run into any snow down below?

194
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,875
None to speak of.

195
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:32,208
Well, I guess I'll roll me a smoke
since I'm woke up.

196
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:40,500
How far did you get?

197
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:45,833
Beech. That's where I aimed for.

198
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:47,958
Beech?

199
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,833
Whatcha doin' down there, Georgie Boy?

200
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,333
Little tomcatting?

201
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:01,458
I was speaking to Mrs. Gordon.

202
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:07,416
Oh, yes.

203
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,708
She cried on your shoulder.

204
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:14,166
So she did.

205
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:17,458
Give her half a chance,

206
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:21,166
and she'll be after some dollar
for Miss Nancy's college fee.

207
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,541
Remember how the Old Lady
brought those girls out to the ranch

208
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,583
as soon as we could get hard-ons?

209
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:37,375
Oh my God.

210
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:41,500
Remember the tomato soup queen?

211
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:48,833
Wasn't it her that wrote you,

212
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,791
"I always will remember the western moon"?

213
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:59,833
Well, guess you coulda taken her out

214
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:02,583
without first putting
a sack over her head.

215
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,291
Unlike some others.

216
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,666
Well, night, Phil.

217
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,375
It's a piece of ass
you're after, fatso,

218
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:36,208
I'm damn sure
you can get it without a license.

219
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,083
Hold it.

220
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,125
What do you do with these?

221
00:30:13,208 --> 00:30:14,208
Goddamn.

222
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:16,875
Do you cut 'em up or something?

223
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,541
George has…

224
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:33,750
He's gone again?

225
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:39,375
…got himself… tangled

226
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:45,458
with a suicide… widow…

227
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:56,500
…and her half-cooked son.

228
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:11,208
A little desk for your big desk.

229
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:19,750
Phil.

230
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:21,958
Yep, got you, old-timer.

231
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:26,833
Did you write to the Old Lady?

232
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,000
Yeah, I dropped 'em both a line.

233
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,791
Did you say something about Rose?

234
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,958
Yeah, Rose…

235
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:41,791
Well, you know as well as I do
what the Old Lady would feel

236
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:47,083
if she thought
you were getting mixed up with her.

237
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:51,958
She'd likely have a hemorrhage.

238
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:59,125
The Old Lady would feel
as one Mrs. Burbank would feel

239
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:01,791
for another Mrs. Burbank.

240
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:04,166
Come again?

241
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:08,000
We were married Sunday.

242
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:12,375
She got rid of her property in Beech.

243
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:37,583
Quit it.

244
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,000
Stand steady, you little bitch, huh?

245
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,125
Come on.

246
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:47,666
- Look at me, you little bitch!
- Huh? Yeah?

247
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,541
Quit it! You fat-faced bitch!

248
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:55,125
Whore!

249
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:05,375
My school boarders eat dinner
at 6:00 p.m. sharp.

250
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:07,958
No dish-washing duty if he has homework.

251
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:11,291
Oh. No shoes inside.

252
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:19,041
Maybe you'd like to come
to the ranch sometimes?

253
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,375
Won't that be nice?

254
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,208
May I keep
some of these rose petals?

255
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:37,416
Hey, ho.

256
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,750
Take the rest for later.

257
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,708
I've been thinking
we should have some sort of dinner party

258
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:02,541
to introduce you to my parents.

259
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:09,416
And perhaps we could invite
the governor and his wife too.

260
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,291
I saw them in Herndon today, and, uh,

261
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,041
I… I kind of already mentioned it to them.

262
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:24,416
Uh, maybe you'd be kind enough
to play something on our old piano.

263
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,291
But, George, I'm not very good.

264
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:31,958
I only played for the moving pictures.

265
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:36,041
You are plenty fine enough for us.

266
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:41,333
The Old Lady can't play a note,
so…

267
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,625
If that's what you want.

268
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:49,541
This looks like a good spot.

269
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:51,625
Pull over here, please.

270
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:53,291
A good spot for what?

271
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,875
You are marvelous, Rose.

272
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,541
Stand beside me, George.

273
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,833
What's happening?

274
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:39,083
Follow me.

275
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:41,166
Left foot forward.

276
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:45,833
One, two, three. And to the side.

277
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:49,083
One, two, three. And back.

278
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:52,541
One, two, three.

279
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:56,833
- To the side again. One, two…
- Sorry, I… I really can't.

280
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:02,208
- I really can't dance. I…
- You're dancing.

281
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:05,166
Here. This foot forward.

282
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:08,625
Don't think.

283
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:12,750
One, two, three. To the side.

284
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:15,166
One, two, three. And back.

285
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,500
One, two, three.

286
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,416
I told you I'd teach you.

287
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:30,458
Forward, two, three.

288
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:31,875
Side, two…

289
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,291
What is it, George?

290
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,375
I just…

291
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:02,375
I wanted to say how nice it is

292
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:05,416
not to be alone.

293
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:54,208
Go on up and get out of the cold.

294
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:15,791
Hello, Phil.

295
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:18,416
You remember Rose?

296
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:21,416
- Oh, hello there.
- Hello.

297
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:25,583
- Something wrong with the furnace?
- Search me.

298
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:31,875
- I'll go down and shake it up.
- I've been hanging around for you all day.

299
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,541
There's a deed
the Old Gent wants sent to him.

300
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:38,583
Well, I figure that can go till morning.

301
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:41,958
- You all right?
- I'm perfectly fine, George.

302
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:01,375
Well, brother Phil,

303
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:04,791
we had such a nice trip...

304
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,083
I'm not your brother.

305
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:08,375
You're a cheap schemer.

306
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:29,916
"We had such a nice trip."

307
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:04,125
Come on in.

308
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
This is the bathroom.
Just make yourself at home.

309
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,125
Yeah, that's fine.

310
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:20,833
All right.

311
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:08,291
Mm-hmm.

312
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:54,791
Now, you just make yourself comfortable.

313
00:43:57,708 --> 00:44:00,166
Now, I'm going to bring you a surprise.

314
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,916
What is it?

315
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:05,208
Well, then it won't be a surprise.

316
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:27,708
When the rains come,
the cellar gets flooded.

317
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:32,916
So, the rats all drown.
They float to the surface.

318
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,041
I have to get the young lads in
to scoop 'em all up with a…

319
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,333
Please keep talking.

320
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:51,375
Don't mind me.

321
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:53,625
I like to keep busy.

322
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:09,666
Easy.

323
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,333
We got it.

324
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:13,791
Head to the right.

325
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,458
- Turn it around that way.
- Please, I'll take it.

326
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:24,708
- What is it?
- Head to the front door.

327
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:27,125
George. Is that…

328
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:29,583
Is that a grand?

329
00:45:29,666 --> 00:45:31,583
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

330
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:36,083
- Whoa, hold it.
- It's a Mason & Hamlin baby grand.

331
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:39,000
Oh no, it's… it's too good for me. I'm…

332
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:42,541
I'm just very average.
I… I only know tunes.

333
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:44,958
That's what I want, tunes.

334
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:46,875
The governor too.

335
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:50,791
We don't want a concert.
We just wanna hear you play, Rose.

336
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,875
- I should like to look on the governor…
- Easy.

337
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:58,416
…as he drives up
and gets out of his vehicle.

338
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:02,958
- One step at a time, ready?
- Two, three, four.

339
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:32,958
- You make a rope with these?
- These strips? Yeah.

340
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:50,416
You boys find something needs doing.

341
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:53,416
Yes, sir.

342
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:07,500
I just came over to speak about something.

343
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,625
Come on, partner.
Open your talker. What is it?

344
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:30,750
His Nibs will be here for dinner
and the Old Gent and the Old Lady.

345
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:34,666
Well, sir, ain't we going into society.

346
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:41,500
She on the pinano again?

347
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,750
Setting your teeth on edge?

348
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,458
No. Uh…

349
00:50:50,416 --> 00:50:52,625
No, I… I like to hear Rose play.

350
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:55,833
Hmm.

351
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:02,541
Well, old-timer, what is it?

352
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:03,708
What's in the noodle?

353
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:07,375
Well…

354
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:11,625
Phil. I, uh…

355
00:51:14,916 --> 00:51:17,291
- I just…
- Go on, spit it out.

356
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:21,375
- Well, it's about His Nibs, the governor.
- All right.

357
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,958
And, uh…

358
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:27,000
Well, it's not so much about His Nibs

359
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:32,458
but His Nibs' wife, actually, uh…

360
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:39,041
I was thinking His Nibs
probably wouldn't mind so much,

361
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:43,333
but his missus might.

362
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:45,416
What, for dear Christ's sake?

363
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:49,875
Well, it's sort of a hard thing…

364
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:52,583
…to say.

365
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:53,750
Uh…

366
00:51:57,833 --> 00:52:01,041
She might mind if you come
to the table without a washup.

367
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Yeah.

368
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:31,208
Hello, Mother, Father.

369
00:52:31,291 --> 00:52:32,250
Hello.

370
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,583
The car's around the side.

371
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:38,916
Is there anyone with you?

372
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:41,250
My wife.

373
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:54,041
The napkin is fanned, so…

374
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:58,875
Light the fire.

375
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,333
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

376
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:02,375
We may as well try and warm this place.

377
00:53:04,125 --> 00:53:05,916
Water, white wine…

378
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:11,291
Use your hand. Use your hand like so.

379
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:13,875
They're here.

380
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:27,208
You keep warm. I can bring them in.

381
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:56,000
Oh, how sweet.
They have their own umbrella.

382
00:53:56,083 --> 00:53:59,416
- Orange blossoms.
- It's an island of civilization here.

383
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,333
Mmm.

384
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:03,875
I was, uh, telling Georgie
about your brother.

385
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:06,125
Phi Beta Kappa at Yale, wasn't it?

386
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:08,541
Yes, in classics.

387
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:10,458
That's right.

388
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:15,458
So, uh… he swears at the cattle
in Greek or Latin?

389
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:23,333
Yeah.

390
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:30,125
Uh, Rose plays the piano very well.

391
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:31,708
Do you?

392
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,916
That's a nice surprise.

393
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:46,708
I'll just go have a look-see
out the back for Phil.

394
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:49,291
Oh, good. I want to meet this brother.

395
00:54:50,291 --> 00:54:51,291
Yes.

396
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,250
I suppose
there was some sort of an injury.

397
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,041
Oh, Edward, Georgina.

398
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:59,833
Ah! Here are two people we can't fool.

399
00:54:59,916 --> 00:55:03,583
Oh no, you cannot. We know everything.
We're walking encyclopedias.

400
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,875
At least I am.
I have nothing to do but read.

401
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:08,958
She's been reading
"The Curse of Tutankhamun" in <i>The Digest.</i>

402
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:11,291
So, uh, you believe in the curse?

403
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:14,416
Oh, no, no, I'm not drinking
George's concoction.

404
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,333
Yes, I do. But did you know
that Tutankhamun was just a boy?

405
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:19,291
Only 18.

406
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:32,958
Phil, are you here?

407
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:43,750
I was looking for you.

408
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,458
Well, you found me.

409
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:52,958
Everyone's here.
And we're just about to eat.

410
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:56,125
They're asking after you.

411
00:55:58,041 --> 00:55:59,000
Really?

412
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:02,708
Yes, we're counting on your conversation.

413
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:11,750
I shouldn't have said
what I said to you about...

414
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:15,166
You two can keep your apologies
to yourself. I'm not coming.

415
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:18,750
And what will I say?

416
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:23,458
The Old Lady wants to see you too.
She's come a long way.

417
00:56:23,541 --> 00:56:24,958
You can tell them the truth.

418
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:29,083
That I stink and I like it.

419
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:34,000
Nothing could have happened
to Phil, could it?

420
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:37,958
No, he'll be fine.
Something just must've come up.

421
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:41,791
So, Rose…

422
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:45,625
Are you going to play for us?

423
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:48,208
Yes, George told me
you play very well.

424
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:51,083
- Oh no, I'm terribly out of practice.
- Yes, we'd love that.

425
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:54,500
Come now, you've been playing a lot.

426
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:55,666
You know you have.

427
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,458
I don't know what to play.

428
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,333
Why,

429
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:01,583
play the one I like.

430
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:07,583
- What one?
- Why, the… the one about the Gypsy.

431
00:57:07,666 --> 00:57:09,708
I… I can't seem to remember that one.

432
00:57:13,416 --> 00:57:16,416
Just play anything.

433
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:08,833
I'm so sorry.

434
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:12,166
I can't seem to play.

435
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:17,083
I… I played in a cinema pit
for hours and hours.

436
00:58:17,166 --> 00:58:19,750
I'm… I'm so sorry.

437
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:24,291
Well, she got you halter trained,
right, George? That's the main thing.

438
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,000
I'm so sorry.

439
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:28,666
No, it was a lovely, lovely evening.

440
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:29,583
Thank you.

441
00:58:39,875 --> 00:58:41,791
Oh, you're Phil.

442
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,791
So, you weren't eaten by a cougar.

443
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:47,041
Not yet.

444
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:49,708
I am sorry
to have missed your conversation.

445
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:51,208
I've heard you're brilliant.

446
00:58:51,291 --> 00:58:54,458
You're gonna want to keep your distance.
I'm just off the horse.

447
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:57,208
Anyhows, you don't want conversation.

448
00:58:57,291 --> 00:59:00,166
You've been listening to the pinano
and dancing, I guess.

449
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:04,291
You dance?

450
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:11,958
You didn't play?

451
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:15,375
You sure did practice a terrible lot.

452
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,875
See, you wouldn't think
there was much difference

453
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:22,333
between a cinema pit and a dinner party.

454
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:23,916
Where have you been, Phil?

455
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:27,291
I could hardly eat worrying about you.

456
00:59:28,458 --> 00:59:31,041
I didn't get washed up, so I didn't come.

457
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:32,666
You didn't wash?

458
00:59:35,583 --> 00:59:39,333
Oh, he's a ranchman, isn't that right?
That's honest dirt.

459
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:43,833
- Thank you, again.
- Thank you.

460
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:57,875
I'll just run and grab you
a blanket for the ride.

461
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:16,875
All right, goodbye.

462
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,166
I wondered
if you didn't think about

463
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,583
leaving your medical books here
for the summer.

464
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:03,125
I thought about it, but…
but you understand they were Dad's.

465
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:04,875
Turn around.

466
01:01:07,916 --> 01:01:08,958
Are you eating?

467
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:13,333
I made a new friend.

468
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,041
He calls me Doctor,
and I call him Professor,

469
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:17,916
'cause that's what we wanna be.

470
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,458
Why don't you invite your friend
to the ranch?

471
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:22,708
No, Rose.

472
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:24,875
Why not?

473
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,375
Thank you.

474
01:01:27,458 --> 01:01:29,583
I don't want him to meet a certain person.

475
01:01:34,333 --> 01:01:35,708
A bull calf, boss!

476
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:38,416
Keep that leg stretched out!
You got him?

477
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,583
Grab his head!

478
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:43,541
I got it! I got it!

479
01:01:53,666 --> 01:01:55,500
How come
you don't wear gloves?

480
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,791
How 'bout
'cause they're not needed.

481
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:07,208
Castrate 1,500 head,
then nick your thumb on the last.

482
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:13,625
Well, fatso, I think we're finished.

483
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:23,166
Who's that?

484
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,083
Miss Nancy.

485
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:29,458
Our waiter?

486
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:31,333
Yep, that's him.

487
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:36,000
You're gonna see him
creeping all over the place now.

488
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:37,875
Big eyes goggling.

489
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:44,875
Little Lord Fauntleroy.

490
01:03:01,916 --> 01:03:03,041
Rose?

491
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:06,541
Does he like his room?

492
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:07,958
Mm-hmm.

493
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:10,166
I think so.

494
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:14,041
Watch your fires. Summer's coming.

495
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:18,750
Which also means any Indians camping
need to be moved off the property.

496
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:20,000
No exceptions.

497
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:23,791
We got animals they want to eat. Got it?

498
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:25,375
Yes, sir.

499
01:03:25,458 --> 01:03:26,875
We don't sell hides.

500
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:29,916
We don't sell anything here.

501
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:52,125
Keep your eyes and ears open.

502
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:55,000
Maybe find yourselves
an arrowhead up by them aspens.

503
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,041
Rose?

504
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,916
I have a headache.

505
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:49,750
Have a seat.

506
01:04:54,916 --> 01:04:56,666
I'm not eating tonight.

507
01:04:56,750 --> 01:05:02,166
It's George's week in town,
so it's just Phil.

508
01:05:03,458 --> 01:05:04,625
Mm-hmm.

509
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:08,458
I made a trap.

510
01:05:08,541 --> 01:05:11,291
Oh no. It's… it's not a snake, is it?

511
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:16,958
It's a bunny.

512
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:19,333
Oh. Oh!

513
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,458
You're okay.

514
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:28,750
No, no, it's scared.

515
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:30,291
- Come here.
- Get it, Peter.

516
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:32,750
Come here. Come here. Come here.

517
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,708
Bring him to me.

518
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:38,166
Aw.

519
01:05:52,291 --> 01:05:53,708
Don't worry about him.

520
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:57,166
You can eat in your room.

521
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,833
They dug up that graveyard
to make way for the new highway.

522
01:06:03,916 --> 01:06:06,750
Among those buried there
was a friend of mine.

523
01:06:06,833 --> 01:06:11,500
A clumsy tractor driver
broke open the coffin,

524
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:17,208
and they found her hair
had continued to grow after her death.

525
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:24,000
The whole coffin just stuffed
with her lovely golden hair.

526
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:27,250
Except for a few feet from the end,

527
01:06:28,791 --> 01:06:30,041
where it was gray.

528
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,500
Can I take it up?

529
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:37,583
- Some say she was a beauty.
- What?

530
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:39,875
Golden braids
on top of her hair.

531
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:42,500
Oh! Yes, go and see. It's very sweet.

532
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,708
- No, please. Get out of my room.
- Where's your rabbit?

533
01:06:57,708 --> 01:06:58,833
I got it a carrot.

534
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:00,708
It doesn't want one.

535
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:02,833
Why?

536
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,333
Holy hell.

537
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:19,583
Shut the door.

538
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:35,000
Now, even if you're happy
being in your room all day,

539
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,416
it's good for me.

540
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:39,000
- Mom, I have a lot to do.
- Come on.

541
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:41,333
Peter…

542
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:44,708
I thought you liked rabbits.

543
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:48,416
Yes. I do.

544
01:07:50,208 --> 01:07:52,666
But if I want to be a surgeon,
I have to practice.

545
01:07:55,041 --> 01:07:58,041
Well, you're not to kill them
in the house, Peter.

546
01:07:58,875 --> 01:08:00,500
No, I'm putting my foot down.

547
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:05,375
Oh, where'd a man be
if he always did what his mother told him?

548
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:06,458
I'll score.

549
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:12,375
Whoa!

550
01:08:12,958 --> 01:08:14,208
Point to Mrs. Burbank.

551
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:17,083
I know, Lola. You don't have to…

552
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:21,416
You don't have to narrate it.
I'll just… remember.

553
01:08:27,458 --> 01:08:30,250
- Whoo!
- Yeah, that was definitely out.

554
01:08:45,416 --> 01:08:48,708
Lola, can you please take over?
I have a migraine.

555
01:08:49,541 --> 01:08:50,541
Yeah.

556
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,291
- Where do you want me?
- Back there.

557
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,291
Yes, ma'am.

558
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:55,875
- I hit that way.
- I was aiming for you.

559
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:57,291
Don't listen to Bobby.

560
01:08:57,375 --> 01:08:58,708
Are you all right, Mother?

561
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:01,833
I feel like my eyes
are going to pop out of my head.

562
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:12,958
It's Phil, isn't it?

563
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:16,500
He's cold.

564
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:19,541
He's just a man, Peter, only another man.

565
01:09:21,333 --> 01:09:22,333
You go ahead.

566
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:06,166
Yeah? You want 'em off, do you?

567
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,916
You want 'em off?

568
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:09,958
Yeah, come on.

569
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:11,666
Yeah, you want 'em?

570
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,500
Yeah, you got 'em!

571
01:16:38,166 --> 01:16:40,416
Get out of here, you little bitch!

572
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,333
You hear me?

573
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:46,375
Get out of here!

574
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:16,666
I know you. Good worker.

575
01:17:34,791 --> 01:17:36,791
Jesus.

576
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:39,416
You boys wanna eat,
come get it now.

577
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,041
Whoa, whoa.

578
01:18:03,958 --> 01:18:06,041
No one tell him to soak those jeans?

579
01:18:11,708 --> 01:18:12,833
Howdy, ma'am.

580
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:20,541
Little faggot.

581
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:28,500
Little Nancy.

582
01:18:56,708 --> 01:18:57,708
Pete.

583
01:18:58,833 --> 01:18:59,875
Hey, Pete.

584
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:03,041
Peter.

585
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:09,916
You want me, Mr. Burbank?

586
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,250
Well, I don't see
any Mr. Burbank here.

587
01:19:16,666 --> 01:19:17,916
I'm Phil.

588
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:19,791
Yes, Mr. Burbank.

589
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:23,041
I guess it's hard for a young'un like you
to call an old fella like me

590
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:26,166
just plain Phil, at first.

591
01:19:28,375 --> 01:19:30,041
Now come and take a look at this.

592
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,333
Have you done any braiding
or plaiting yourself, Pete?

593
01:19:37,666 --> 01:19:40,166
No, I never have, sir.

594
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:49,250
Peter, we kind of got off
on the wrong foot.

595
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:53,333
- Did we, sir?
- Forget the "sir" stuff.

596
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,250
That can happen to people.

597
01:19:57,875 --> 01:20:00,250
People who get to be good friends.

598
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,875
Well, you know what?

599
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:05,833
What? What, Phil?

600
01:20:08,875 --> 01:20:11,166
Now, you see? You did it.

601
01:20:12,166 --> 01:20:13,291
You called me Phil.

602
01:20:15,291 --> 01:20:19,250
I'm gonna finish this rope and give it
to you and teach you how to use it.

603
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:23,500
Sort of a lonesome place out here, Pete.

604
01:20:24,416 --> 01:20:26,333
Unless you get in the swing of things.

605
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:29,458
Thank you… Phil.

606
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:34,541
How long do you expect it would take
to finish that rope?

607
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:37,375
I could get it finished
before you go back to school.

608
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,166
Well…

609
01:20:43,791 --> 01:20:45,458
It won't be very long then, Phil.

610
01:21:52,166 --> 01:21:53,166
Get on it.

611
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:56,000
You can sit on it, Pete.

612
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,250
Get yourself used to it.

613
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:05,458
You got any boots?

614
01:22:06,666 --> 01:22:08,708
- Yes.
- You should wear 'em.

615
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:13,375
Don't let your mom make a sissy of you.

616
01:22:24,166 --> 01:22:25,541
That's impressive, Phil.

617
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:29,166
Well, just by sitting there,

618
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:32,875
you're soaking up all the riding know-how
you'll ever need and then some.

619
01:22:33,666 --> 01:22:35,708
That saddle belonged to Bronco Henry.

620
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:38,875
Greatest rider I ever knew.

621
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:53,083
There's a cliff way out back of the ranch
with initials and 1805 carved into it.

622
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:56,250
Must have been some fella
from the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

623
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:00,750
They were real men in those days.

624
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:06,333
Let's say just you and me
go out for a couple of days.

625
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:08,708
Find those trails
and follow them to the end.

626
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:14,541
Wouldn't be surprised if there were gold

627
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:18,000
or precious minerals in them there rocks.

628
01:23:21,916 --> 01:23:24,291
Do many of the calves
die from wolves?

629
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:33,416
There's always a few that get…
tore up or hamstrung or die of anthrax.

630
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:34,375
Call it blackleg.

631
01:23:34,458 --> 01:23:37,625
You know, you talk like a Victrola record.
You know that?

632
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:40,375
No, I didn't know.

633
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:42,291
Yeah, well, you do.

634
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:54,708
- Did Bronco Henry teach you to ride, Phil?
- Yep.

635
01:23:57,750 --> 01:24:01,541
He taught me to use my eyes
in ways that other people can't.

636
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,000
Take that hill over there.

637
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:14,166
Most people look at it
and just see a hill.

638
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:18,041
Where Bronco looked at it,
what do you suppose he saw?

639
01:24:22,375 --> 01:24:23,375
A barking dog.

640
01:24:25,166 --> 01:24:28,166
- The hell, you just saw that now?
- No.

641
01:24:29,416 --> 01:24:30,666
When I first came here.

642
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:35,458
See, it looks like a dog
with its jaw wide open.

643
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:39,833
You… you just saw that?

644
01:24:41,291 --> 01:24:42,125
Yeah.

645
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,166
Peter.

646
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Peter.

647
01:24:53,416 --> 01:24:55,458
Can't you come in and talk for a little?

648
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,416
You've gotten to be quite friendly
with Phil, haven't you?

649
01:25:16,208 --> 01:25:17,625
Is he nice to you?

650
01:25:20,208 --> 01:25:21,541
He's making a rope for me.

651
01:25:23,291 --> 01:25:24,375
Making a rope?

652
01:25:27,166 --> 01:25:29,875
Peter, I wish you wouldn't make that sound
with your comb.

653
01:25:33,416 --> 01:25:34,500
I wasn't aware.

654
01:25:34,583 --> 01:25:36,333
When I was little, I…

655
01:25:36,416 --> 01:25:40,625
I felt a chill in my spine when I heard
the chalk squeak on a blackboard.

656
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,208
Oh, Miss…
Mrs. Merchant, that's who it was.

657
01:25:47,541 --> 01:25:52,375
She… she drew chalk stars
by our names on the blackboard.

658
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:56,916
I wonder why it was stars she gave us.

659
01:25:58,416 --> 01:26:02,083
Why not diamonds? Why not hearts?

660
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:05,708
Why not spades? Why…

661
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:13,375
I wonder why it was always stars.

662
01:26:14,916 --> 01:26:17,208
Because stars are supposed
to be unreachable.

663
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:21,375
Yes.

664
01:26:22,416 --> 01:26:25,666
But they weren't unreachable
because she gave them to us.

665
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:31,791
- And, Peter?
- Hmm?

666
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:36,541
We had this valentine box,
and it was covered with white crepe paper.

667
01:26:38,416 --> 01:26:41,125
And we would paste big, red hearts on it.

668
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:44,416
Lopsided hearts.

669
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,333
And you had a great many valentines.

670
01:26:50,416 --> 01:26:51,666
A great many?

671
01:26:55,833 --> 01:26:57,125
Because you're beautiful.

672
01:27:08,166 --> 01:27:10,458
Is there a sound that makes you shiver?

673
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:20,958
I don't remember.

674
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:25,833
We're not unreachable.

675
01:27:30,833 --> 01:27:31,916
Hey.

676
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:36,750
No, we're not unreachable.

677
01:27:36,833 --> 01:27:39,250
Mother, you don't have to do this.

678
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:43,208
I'll see you don't have to do it.

679
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:02,333
- This his first week?
- Nope, third.

680
01:28:02,416 --> 01:28:03,375
Third?

681
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:06,208
Open up the gate. Let him out.

682
01:28:06,291 --> 01:28:08,333
- You sure? He's not ready.
- Go on. Let him out.

683
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:18,791
Yeehaw, cowboy! Whoo!

684
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:19,833
There you go!

685
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,708
Grab her by the reins!

686
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:25,791
- What you doing?
- Going to give him a hand.

687
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:26,875
Don't.

688
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,291
- Let him figure it out.
- Oh, oh!

689
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:31,375
Or not.

690
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:35,833
Fall off, you get back on.

691
01:28:37,291 --> 01:28:38,541
Get her over!

692
01:30:51,208 --> 01:30:53,625
Any happenings while I was away?

693
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:55,250
Boys dug the ditch.

694
01:30:56,416 --> 01:30:57,916
Water's flowing good.

695
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:00,041
Fixing that stack there.

696
01:31:00,125 --> 01:31:02,333
Hey, Pete!

697
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:03,791
Come here.

698
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:09,041
Peter? Peter?

699
01:31:11,416 --> 01:31:13,125
Where are you two off to?

700
01:31:14,208 --> 01:31:17,416
We're going to the far field
to fence off the stack there.

701
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:20,083
Peter?

702
01:31:21,833 --> 01:31:23,208
- Rose?
- Peter!

703
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:26,958
Rose, what's the matter?

704
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,166
Rose?

705
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:34,791
Can't Peter go with you today?

706
01:31:35,958 --> 01:31:39,208
Well, he could, but him and Phil
have kinda paired up.

707
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:40,750
I don't want that.

708
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:44,625
- I don't want him to be with Phil at all.
- But, Rose…

709
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:49,166
He's helping him.
He taught him how to ride.

710
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:46,208
Hey, Pete, my pal.

711
01:32:50,208 --> 01:32:51,625
Hey, Pete, my pal.

712
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:53,958
You gonna help?

713
01:33:12,916 --> 01:33:15,125
You know who started riding
as late as you?

714
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,750
- Who?
- Bronco Henry.

715
01:33:20,208 --> 01:33:22,833
Hadn't done any of it
till he was about your age now.

716
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:30,166
Hello, Mr. Cottontail.

717
01:33:37,541 --> 01:33:40,416
Hey, Peter, let's see how long it takes

718
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,166
before Mr. Cottontail
makes a run for the open.

719
01:33:44,333 --> 01:33:49,416
Now, as kids,
we used to take bets…

720
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,416
…on how many poles we'd remove

721
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:55,458
before the animals ran out
and made a run for it.

722
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:08,000
Oh, he's still in there.

723
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:10,583
Gutsy little bugger.

724
01:34:11,708 --> 01:34:13,083
I guess he has to be gutsy.

725
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:23,750
Damn son of a bitch.

726
01:34:30,041 --> 01:34:32,250
Come on, now. Come on.

727
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:35,958
Think it broke his leg.

728
01:34:37,666 --> 01:34:40,000
Well, put him out of his misery.

729
01:34:44,625 --> 01:34:45,666
Hmm.

730
01:34:47,625 --> 01:34:48,625
It's all right.

731
01:35:04,083 --> 01:35:05,250
That's deep.

732
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,333
You okay, Phil?

733
01:35:08,416 --> 01:35:09,500
Yeah, what the hell?

734
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,083
Must be a splinter.

735
01:35:31,083 --> 01:35:33,583
You got a tan.
That's a cowboy tan you got.

736
01:35:34,416 --> 01:35:35,250
Hmm.

737
01:35:40,875 --> 01:35:42,291
Bronco Henry told me that…

738
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:47,208
A man was made
by patience and the odds against him.

739
01:35:52,375 --> 01:35:54,041
My father said…

740
01:35:56,041 --> 01:35:57,208
Obstacles.

741
01:35:59,291 --> 01:36:01,041
And you had to try and remove them.

742
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:02,458
Another way to put it.

743
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:09,083
Well, you've certainly got obstacles.
That's a fact, Pete, me boy.

744
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:12,958
- "Obstacles"?
- Well, take your ma.

745
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:16,666
Today or any day…

746
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:20,083
How she's on the sauce.

747
01:36:21,166 --> 01:36:22,375
"On the sauce"?

748
01:36:24,708 --> 01:36:25,708
Drinking, Pete.

749
01:36:26,708 --> 01:36:27,833
Boozing it up.

750
01:36:32,458 --> 01:36:34,500
I guess you know
she's been half-shot all summer.

751
01:36:34,583 --> 01:36:36,833
Yeah, I know.

752
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:40,958
She never used to drink.

753
01:36:41,791 --> 01:36:44,166
- Oh, didn't she now?
- No.

754
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:48,125
- She never did.
- But your pa, Pete?

755
01:36:49,875 --> 01:36:51,208
My father?

756
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:52,500
Yeah, your father.

757
01:36:55,416 --> 01:36:57,458
I guess he hit the bottle pretty hard?

758
01:36:58,791 --> 01:36:59,791
The booze?

759
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:04,291
Until right at the very end.

760
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:11,708
Then he hung himself.

761
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:18,125
I found him.

762
01:37:21,875 --> 01:37:22,875
Cut him down.

763
01:37:31,166 --> 01:37:33,208
He used to worry I wasn't kind enough.

764
01:37:36,958 --> 01:37:38,250
That I was too strong.

765
01:37:38,333 --> 01:37:39,750
You, too strong?

766
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:43,041
He got that wrong.

767
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:46,375
Poor kid.

768
01:37:51,916 --> 01:37:53,583
Things will work out for you yet.

769
01:38:05,208 --> 01:38:06,416
Where's Mrs. Lewis?

770
01:38:07,208 --> 01:38:08,416
She's with the Indians.

771
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,125
What Indians?

772
01:38:14,041 --> 01:38:14,875
These ones.

773
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:17,500
You shouldn't even be here.

774
01:38:18,625 --> 01:38:19,750
He won't like it.

775
01:38:20,541 --> 01:38:21,791
Go now. Go.

776
01:38:26,625 --> 01:38:29,083
Water!

777
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:34,291
They were standing right in front
of the damn things asking,

778
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:36,333
"Do we have any hides?"

779
01:38:38,666 --> 01:38:41,958
"Do we have any hides?" Are they leaving?

780
01:38:43,833 --> 01:38:45,625
Yes, they've got their horse going.

781
01:38:46,416 --> 01:38:49,708
I told them
the hides are gonna be burned.

782
01:38:54,333 --> 01:38:55,416
Why?

783
01:38:56,041 --> 01:38:58,291
Why are the hides going to be burned?

784
01:38:58,375 --> 01:39:00,500
Phil doesn't want anyone else to have 'em.

785
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,333
Waits till there's a big pile
and sets fire to the lot.

786
01:39:05,416 --> 01:39:08,000
He'd blow up
if they even touched 'em.

787
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:11,125
What's she doin'?

788
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:30,125
Please, please.

789
01:39:32,208 --> 01:39:33,833
Wait! Please!

790
01:39:36,625 --> 01:39:38,708
Wait! Please, stop.

791
01:39:39,583 --> 01:39:40,583
Please wait.

792
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:43,125
Please.

793
01:39:44,125 --> 01:39:45,125
Come back.

794
01:39:45,958 --> 01:39:47,333
Take the hides.

795
01:39:47,416 --> 01:39:50,916
It would be my honor
if you would take them.

796
01:39:52,833 --> 01:39:53,833
Please.

797
01:39:55,041 --> 01:39:56,541
My husband owns the ranch.

798
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:01,125
Come back. Take them.

799
01:40:32,625 --> 01:40:34,083
They're so soft.

800
01:40:36,416 --> 01:40:38,875
So deliciously soft.

801
01:40:41,125 --> 01:40:42,125
So beautiful.

802
01:41:07,958 --> 01:41:10,583
- You all right, ma'am?
- Is she breathing?

803
01:41:10,666 --> 01:41:11,583
Ma'am.

804
01:41:12,625 --> 01:41:13,958
- Ma'am.
- What happened?

805
01:41:14,458 --> 01:41:16,125
She just collapsed, sir.

806
01:41:19,708 --> 01:41:20,708
Rose?

807
01:41:42,333 --> 01:41:43,500
Sorry, sir.

808
01:41:44,875 --> 01:41:45,791
Thank you, Lola.

809
01:41:59,625 --> 01:42:00,500
Mine.

810
01:42:03,875 --> 01:42:05,666
- Almost done.
- Howdy.

811
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:07,541
- Hey, boss.
- All right.

812
01:42:19,416 --> 01:42:20,708
I'll be damned.

813
01:42:32,666 --> 01:42:34,375
Is there something wrong, Phil?

814
01:42:34,458 --> 01:42:35,458
Wrong?

815
01:42:36,125 --> 01:42:37,791
For Christ's sake.

816
01:42:37,875 --> 01:42:40,500
Every goddamn hide is gone!

817
01:42:41,333 --> 01:42:43,958
Oh, she really put
her foot into it this time.

818
01:42:45,833 --> 01:42:47,041
You think she did it?

819
01:42:48,458 --> 01:42:50,208
- She sold them?
- Bloody tootin'.

820
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:54,083
- Or maybe even gave them away.
- Why? Why?

821
01:42:54,166 --> 01:42:56,625
Why would she do that, Phil?
She knew that we needed the hides.

822
01:42:56,708 --> 01:42:58,625
Because she was drunk!

823
01:42:59,583 --> 01:43:02,166
Pie-eyed! She was smashed!

824
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,500
I'd think you'd know
from the books your pa left you

825
01:43:05,583 --> 01:43:07,916
that your ma's got a… a whatchamacallit.

826
01:43:08,666 --> 01:43:12,500
Alcoholic personality.
It comes under the letter A!

827
01:43:19,958 --> 01:43:23,208
- You're not gonna say anything to her?
- Say anything?

828
01:43:23,291 --> 01:43:24,625
I won't say nothin'.

829
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:29,416
But sure as one good hell,
brother George is going to.

830
01:43:38,875 --> 01:43:40,375
Rose is not well, Phil.

831
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:44,166
She's ill.

832
01:43:46,791 --> 01:43:48,375
Not well?

833
01:43:50,208 --> 01:43:54,625
It is high time
that that bozo and you got next to a few…

834
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:56,958
What do you ever call them? Facts!

835
01:43:57,041 --> 01:44:02,083
She stashes alcohol all around the place,
even drinking in the stinking alley.

836
01:44:04,708 --> 01:44:06,875
Look at your face in the mirror!

837
01:44:06,958 --> 01:44:11,375
Is it that she could like?
Or our money? Wake the hell up!

838
01:44:11,458 --> 01:44:12,541
That's enough, Phil.

839
01:44:17,833 --> 01:44:20,500
Well, what is the harm?

840
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:23,208
The hides were only going to be burned.

841
01:44:24,083 --> 01:44:25,166
I needed them.

842
01:44:26,666 --> 01:44:28,250
I needed them.

843
01:44:30,166 --> 01:44:31,583
Well, I apologize.

844
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,291
They were mine!

845
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:49,250
I needed them!

846
01:45:05,458 --> 01:45:07,166
- Phil?
- Huh?

847
01:45:14,333 --> 01:45:15,333
Phil, I've…

848
01:45:17,625 --> 01:45:19,458
I've got rawhide to finish the rope.

849
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:23,500
You've got it?

850
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:25,541
What are you doing with rawhide?

851
01:45:26,041 --> 01:45:27,125
I cut some up.

852
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:29,916
I wanted to be like you.

853
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,458
Please take what I've got.

854
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:38,708
Well…

855
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:40,625
That's damn kind of you, Pete.

856
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,208
Tell you something.

857
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:03,750
Everything's gonna be plain sailing
for you from now on in.

858
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:08,583
And you know what?

859
01:46:09,541 --> 01:46:10,541
I'm gonna work.

860
01:46:11,958 --> 01:46:13,583
Finish up that rope tonight.

861
01:46:16,958 --> 01:46:18,708
<i>You'll watch me do it?</i>

862
01:48:47,958 --> 01:48:50,083
How old were you
when you met Bronco Henry?

863
01:48:52,291 --> 01:48:53,708
About the age you are now.

864
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:05,458
Was he your best friend?

865
01:49:06,833 --> 01:49:10,166
Yeah… he was.

866
01:49:11,625 --> 01:49:12,833
He was more than that.

867
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,541
Once, he saved my life.

868
01:49:23,458 --> 01:49:27,583
We were way off up in the hills
shooting elk, and the weather turned mean.

869
01:49:30,083 --> 01:49:35,666
Bronco kept me alive
by… lying body against body in a bedroll.

870
01:49:39,291 --> 01:49:40,875
Fell off to sleep that way.

871
01:49:46,833 --> 01:49:47,833
Naked?

872
01:51:43,916 --> 01:51:46,375
- Phil left already?
- No, he's not here.

873
01:51:48,708 --> 01:51:50,416
He say he was settin' out early?

874
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:51,500
No.

875
01:51:56,958 --> 01:51:58,083
Good mornin'.

876
01:51:59,208 --> 01:52:00,625
Have you seen your brother?

877
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,416
He's not had breakfast?

878
01:52:06,458 --> 01:52:07,916
He's not been down at all.

879
01:52:11,375 --> 01:52:13,250
Can I get
some of that coffee please?

880
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:33,708
I'll run you into Herndon
to see the doctor.

881
01:52:59,541 --> 01:53:00,458
Phil…

882
01:53:02,541 --> 01:53:04,083
What happened to your hand?

883
01:53:07,625 --> 01:53:08,958
Let's get your boots off.

884
01:53:19,875 --> 01:53:21,208
I'm… I'm good.

885
01:53:30,208 --> 01:53:31,625
I'll get the car.

886
01:54:37,666 --> 01:54:38,875
Let's go, Phil.

887
01:54:40,125 --> 01:54:41,291
Where's the boy?

888
01:55:04,875 --> 01:55:05,791
Phil.

889
01:55:15,333 --> 01:55:16,333
I'll get it to him.

890
01:56:09,708 --> 01:56:10,958
I'll take this one.

891
01:56:13,416 --> 01:56:14,250
Uh…

892
01:58:16,083 --> 01:58:22,666
Rose would like you to join us
for Christmas, if you care to.

893
01:58:26,458 --> 01:58:27,291
Yes.

894
01:58:28,416 --> 01:58:29,583
Thank you, George.

01:58:34,875 --> 01:58:36,208
I'm afraid I'm mystified.

896
01:58:37,166 --> 01:58:39,833
I'll know in a day or two
when the results come back.

897
01:58:40,666 --> 01:58:41,958
Those last convulsions…

898
01:58:44,333 --> 01:58:47,458
- Yes?
- Terrible, truly frightful.

899
01:58:49,458 --> 01:58:50,833
You know what I'm thinking?

900
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:52,666
What?

901
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:54,750
Anthrax.

902
01:58:59,458 --> 01:59:02,666
But he never handled diseased animals.

903
01:59:02,750 --> 01:59:04,458
He was particular on that.

904
02:00:01,041 --> 02:00:03,416
"Deliver my soul from the sword,

905
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:05,625
my darling from the power of the dog."
