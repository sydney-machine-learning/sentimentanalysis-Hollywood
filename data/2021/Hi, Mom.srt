1
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:44,407
<i>They say a daughter
is like a vest to her mother.</i>

2
00:00:45,107 --> 00:00:47,007
It's a girl. 2.8 kilograms.

3
00:00:47,307 --> 00:00:49,607
<i>But I think I'm more like a fur coat.</i>

4
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:53,380
It's a girl. 4.9 kilograms.

5
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,380
<i>I was born different than other babies.</i>

6
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,880
<i>Their first word was
either daddy or mommy...</i>

7
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,630
<i>...while mine was "more."</i>

8
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,580
<i>Kids, you know,
always bring trouble to their parents.</i>

9
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,180
Mommy.

10
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,480
I pooped my pants.

11
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,380
<i>But I had some big moments, too.</i>

12
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,980
Mommy.

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,080
I finished first in the race.

14
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,980
<i>As I grew up,
my mom picked up all sorts of skills.</i>

15
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,224
<i>After I started school...</i>

16
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:34,780
<i>...she often came to get lectured herself.</i>

17
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,580
You should help your girl
with her study at home.

18
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,480
<i>It was till much later
that I realize that...</i>

19
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,880
<i>...as it turns out,
not every little girl...</i>

20
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,780
<i>...grows up to be beautiful.</i>

21
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,180
It's been three years...

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,780
...and your daughter's grades
have remained stable.

23
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,280
<i>That was the first time
I spotted white hair on my mom's head.</i>

24
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,313
<i>I don't know if you remember
what your mom looked like in her youth.</i>

25
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,720
<i>I for one seem to remember...</i>

26
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,280
<i>...my mom only as a middle-aged woman.</i>

27
00:02:18,473 --> 00:02:21,107
When will you ever make me proud?

28
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:28,333
I'm so happy today.

29
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:31,433
Now I can officially announce that...

30
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:35,133
...my daughter, Jia Xiaoling,
was admitted into a fine college.

31
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,683
<i>I've finally made my mom proud.</i>

32
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:41,182
<i>Even my dad was super excited.</i>

33
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:46,113
<i>All it took was a little shenanigan
on my part.</i>

34
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,343
Fantastic.

35
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:48,465
Of course.

36
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:50,980
I am the best certificate forger
in all of Xiangfan.

37
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,187
Here, this is your own adult
education diploma.

38
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:55,653
Compare the two.

39
00:02:58,073 --> 00:02:59,280
You won't be able to tell.

40
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:03,033
The forger guy promised me on his honor
that no one could tell the difference.

41
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,327
Fantastic.

42
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,853
Whose signature is this?

43
00:03:11,953 --> 00:03:13,020
Mine.

44
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,487
Your handwriting is child-like.
Nothing like a dean's.

45
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:22,680
How dean-like is it now?

46
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:23,894
Good.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,199
Almost a like doctor's handwriting.

48
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:36,093
Perfect.

49
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:51,263
How many letters of admission
do you reckon...

50
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:53,566
...the Capital Academy of Drama
sends out every year?

51
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:55,673
Hundreds...

52
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:57,573
...if not thousands.

53
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:03,943
And every single one
is signed by the dean.

54
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,543
To think our daughter
will be in such good hands.

55
00:04:06,643 --> 00:04:07,693
Exactly.

56
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:09,943
Come here.

57
00:04:13,793 --> 00:04:14,793
Huanying.

58
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:19,093
Is this not Wang Qin?
I didn't think you'd make it.

59
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,318
Well, I have to.

60
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:22,093
Why didn't you say hello to aunt Qin?

61
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:23,633
Your mom and I both resent her.

62
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,840
Without Shen Guanglin, her husband,
she's nobody.

63
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,320
Quit gossiping.

64
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:32,677
She's not really drinking green tea.
She's showing off her watch.

65
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:37,427
Just wait and see. She's start bragging
even before her butt touches the chair.

66
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,827
The atmosphere is great today.

67
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:41,127
Reminds me of the past...

68
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:44,860
...when everyone was in my house
watching TV together.

69
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,117
Ling, you wouldn't know but
it was so much fun.

70
00:04:48,317 --> 00:04:50,253
Speaking of TV,
it just occurred to me that...

71
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:53,353
...your family was the first to own
a television among us factory workers.

72
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:57,393
You were so envied.
Even me, the director, was jealous of you.

73
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,350
We couldn't possibly have stolen
your thunder, Director.

74
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,493
Remember that volley ball tournament
you set up back in the day?

75
00:05:03,593 --> 00:05:07,393
That was a huge event
and it was truly glorious.

76
00:05:07,493 --> 00:05:09,666
Are you complimenting me or yourself?

77
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:12,000
Weren't you the winner that year?

78
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,127
How dare she?

79
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,880
If your mom and I hadn't missed that game
she wouldn't have won.

80
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:21,050
It would've totally been your mother.

81
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,900
What would my mom have won?

82
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:24,587
A life-changing opportunity.

83
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:26,953
Come by the supermarket tomorrow
and I'll tell you.

84
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:30,973
Now that Ling has gotten
into a great school...

85
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:33,127
...she'd be an actress upon graduation.

86
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,233
With the right director...

87
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,713
...plus a little luck,
who knows what she'll accomplish?

88
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,827
Absolutely.

89
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:44,693
What is your daughter studying in the US?

90
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:46,100
Film directing.

91
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,053
At UCLA.

92
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:58,220
What can she do graduating
as a director there?

93
00:05:58,347 --> 00:05:59,347
Making films.

94
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:01,547
Must be a pain in the ass
trying to find a job back home.

95
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:03,947
- She will stay in America.
- Wouldn't language be a problem?

96
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:05,947
- She's fluent in English.
- Will she make enough money?

97
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:08,647
- Eighty thousand per month.
- Where does she even get paid like that?

98
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:09,747
Hollywood.

99
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:15,300
Now...
I will set an example for you.

100
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,693
Ling...
here's another red envelope from Aunt Bao.

101
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,820
What are you doing?

102
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:26,467
You should've told us
you're gonna do that.

103
00:06:28,947 --> 00:06:32,330
Bao Yumei, what do you think you're doing?
You already gave us one. Give it back now.

104
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,080
- Aunt Bao, I can't take this.
- Ying, what is this? It's not for you.

105
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,330
It's for the young lady.

106
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,030
But you've already given one.
Give it back to Aunt Bao.

107
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,180
I'm just happy that my god-daughter
finally got into college.

108
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
I'll just put it in your backpack.

109
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,080
Aunt Bao, not the bag.

110
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,080
What's this for? You already gave us one.

111
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,080
Yeah, you did.

112
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,580
Mom, give me my bag.

113
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,880
What's the matter with you?

114
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,380
Mom, give me my bag.

115
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,680
Kid, leave it be.

116
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,080
We've already received your good will.

117
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,380
Just a token of love.

118
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,980
Put it in the bag.

119
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,080
Mom, give me my bag.

120
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,980
Mom, give me my bag.

121
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,960
Give it to your husband, Zhang Jiang.

122
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:25,023
<i>As a tree owes its exuberance
to rich soil...</i>

123
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:27,223
<i>...children owe their success
to good parenting.</i>

124
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:28,373
This one has no seal.

125
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,273
<i>A woman born fragile will grow strong
once she becomes a mother.</i>

126
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:34,573
<i>Please welcome the mother of the prodigy,
Ms. Li Huanying...</i>

127
00:07:34,673 --> 00:07:36,573
<i>...to the stage!</i>

128
00:07:45,793 --> 00:07:47,567
Mom, it's all my fault.

129
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,473
I just wanted to make you proud.

130
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:58,607
I know I'm such a big loser.

131
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:03,673
Who says you're a loser?

132
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:06,620
But I'll be somebody someday.

133
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,760
I have no doubt.

134
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:16,407
Mom.

135
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,413
A fake college diploma for
an Adult Education Degree?

136
00:08:19,513 --> 00:08:21,513
I was thinking it'd bring in
more gift money.

137
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:25,513
I'll tell you what, comrade Li Huanying,
you need to start planning now.

138
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:26,813
For what?

139
00:08:26,913 --> 00:08:29,413
For what you're gonna buy
when your daughter gets rich.

140
00:08:29,513 --> 00:08:31,613
How big a ballpark
are we talking about here?

141
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,113
How about eighty thousand per month,
like Shen Tingting.

142
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,913
- No way, gotta be more than that.
- Ninety thousand then.

143
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:40,863
In that case,
you deserve a gold necklace.

144
00:08:43,413 --> 00:08:45,813
And this crappy bike of yours,
get rid of it.

145
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:47,463
It can barely carry me.

146
00:08:47,563 --> 00:08:48,613
Let's get you a car.

147
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:50,413
Cars are smothering.

148
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:52,913
It's got windows.

149
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:55,613
Mom, how do you like that one?

150
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:59,013
I'll turn it into a convertible
if you find it smothering.

151
00:08:59,113 --> 00:09:00,113
Alrighty then.

152
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:21,553
Uncle Jia.

153
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,807
We'll see if she
can make it through tonight.

154
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:42,480
Mom...

155
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:46,173
...please don't leave just yet.

156
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:50,633
I'm about to succeed.

157
00:09:51,293 --> 00:09:52,707
If you pass away now...

158
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,820
...I'll blame myself forever.

159
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:03,420
I'm a lousy daughter...

160
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,693
...who has never even made you proud once.

161
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,907
How I wish I could change that.

162
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:38,067
<i>During the 80s...</i>

163
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:41,367
<i>...color film wasn't even available
in China.</i>

164
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:46,017
<i>So, the videos and photos we can find...</i>

165
00:10:46,117 --> 00:10:48,117
<i>...are mostly black and white.</i>

166
00:10:48,217 --> 00:10:49,267
<i>However...</i>

167
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:51,567
<i>- ...skillful photographers...</i>
- Mom.

168
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:55,405
<i>...would use paint to add a touch
of color to those gray pictures.</i>

169
00:10:55,505 --> 00:10:56,518
Mom.

170
00:10:58,667 --> 00:10:59,667
Mom.

171
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:02,067
<i>- As color photos came along...</i>
- Mom.

172
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:03,867
<i>...those sealed memories...</i>

173
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,817
<i>- ...came back to life.</i>
- Mom.

174
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:08,067
<i>Well-arranged factory buildings
made of red bricks...</i>

175
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,367
<i>...energetic workers in blue uniforms...</i>

176
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:15,017
<i>...everything seems to be speaking to
us about what a wonderful time it was.</i>

177
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:18,567
<i>Young people born in the 1950s and 1960s</i>

178
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:22,267
<i>made up the majority of
the workforce in the era.</i>

179
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:24,667
<i>They strode on at a brisk pace...</i>

180
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:28,117
<i>...with a big smile on their faces.</i>

181
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:32,467
<i>Today, we're going to tour
Triumph Chemical Factory...</i>

182
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,567
<i>...for some first-hand experience
of a simpler time.</i>

183
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,967
<i>Not checkmate yet.</i>

184
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:03,067
Then I'll make this move.

185
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:08,367
Again, checkmate.

186
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,130
What's going on?
Wait, what is this?

187
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,180
I was just talking to Ying
and she told me I looked fresh today.

188
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,180
I said it must be the red armband.

189
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,040
That's when this big girl
fell from god knows where...

190
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,447
...and landed on Ying.

191
00:12:26,673 --> 00:12:29,893
- Oh no, someone's crashed.
- She's not from our factory.

192
00:12:29,993 --> 00:12:32,893
Cut the bullshit and hurry.
Take them to the hospital. Now, hurry.

193
00:12:32,993 --> 00:12:35,197
Make way, people.
Come on.

194
00:12:39,187 --> 00:12:41,087
That's right. Good job.

195
00:12:41,187 --> 00:12:42,187
Yeah.

196
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,003
Come on.

197
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:33,987
HI, MOM

198
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,247
Am I dreaming?

199
00:14:49,253 --> 00:14:51,107
Or did I just time travel?

200
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:53,527
You are in trouble.

201
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:55,707
You're a tough one.

202
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,312
Not even a scratch.

203
00:14:57,612 --> 00:14:59,607
Did I pass out?

204
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:01,120
I don't think so.

205
00:15:01,227 --> 00:15:02,853
You wouldn't have snored if you did.

206
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,840
Don't worry,
we won't be harsh on you...

207
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:10,880
...but you can't get away with this.

208
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:16,167
I can see that
you're from an average family.

209
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:19,440
But then again, the average family...

210
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:22,247
...is pretty much average.

211
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,760
Just sign this statement that says...

212
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:31,007
...you take full responsibility
for the incident...

213
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,660
...and that it has nothing to do
with our safety supervisor...

214
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,133
...who, by the name of Zhang Jiang,
played an active role in helping you.

215
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:39,593
- Here, sign it.
- Zhang Jiang.

216
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,887
- Yep, yours truly.
- Uncle Zhang.

217
00:15:41,987 --> 00:15:43,105
Yeah, sign it.

218
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:44,380
Uncle Zhang.

219
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,580
Uncle Zhang, it's me.

220
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
What are you doing?

221
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,080
I'm telling you,
people frown upon this kind of behavior.

222
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,480
- What is the matter with you?
- Uncle Zhang.

223
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,860
I... Ling.

224
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,853
How about I'm Ding?

225
00:15:57,613 --> 00:15:58,787
What year is this?

226
00:15:58,953 --> 00:15:59,953
What?

227
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,833
What year is it now?

228
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,893
1981.

229
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,899
Year of the Rooster.

230
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:18,253
I wasn't even born yet.

231
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:22,527
How did I wind up in 1981?

232
00:16:24,627 --> 00:16:26,280
That character is "xi"?

233
00:16:27,573 --> 00:16:28,900
Li Huanying's family.

234
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,447
Mom.

235
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,660
Mom.

236
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:39,407
Mom.

237
00:16:40,473 --> 00:16:41,587
Mom.

238
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:43,100
Mom.

239
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,340
Mom.

240
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:46,667
- Mom.
- What are you doing here? Let's go.

241
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,367
Let's get out of here first, now.

242
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:50,867
Uncle Zhang, this is an odd situation.
You don't understand.

243
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:53,217
I'm sure the police will, let's go.

244
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:54,967
Uncle Zhang, please, you always liked me.

245
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:56,767
Who likes you? Come with me now.

246
00:16:56,867 --> 00:16:58,760
- Hurry up.
<i>- Zhang Jiang.</i>

247
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:24,100
- Mom.
- Drop the act.

248
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:27,340
Ying. She's the one that crashed on you.

249
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,847
You'd better confess everything,
or go talk to the police.

250
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,113
I'll confess.

251
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,600
I'm from the year 2001.

252
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,900
Police it is.

253
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,100
I'm your future...

254
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,453
Wait, Zhang Jiang.

255
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,327
She does look familiar.

256
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:50,353
Do we know each other?

257
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:52,653
Definitely.

258
00:17:57,053 --> 00:17:58,600
You are my cousin from the city.

259
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,600
Li Leying.

260
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,033
It's been forever, cousin.

261
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,613
I don't think we've met before.

262
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,780
Yet I recognized you at first glance.

263
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,880
You look just like my aunt.

264
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,080
Do I?

265
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,150
What brought you here, Leying?

266
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,020
Hang on.

267
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,373
I get a question.

268
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,687
Stand up.

269
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:32,993
I thought your name was Ling.

270
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:36,293
How come she calls you Leying?

271
00:18:37,587 --> 00:18:39,600
Ling is short for Leying.

272
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,653
Just say it fast.

273
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:44,307
People usually call me Xiaoling.

274
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:45,847
I got it.

275
00:18:46,353 --> 00:18:49,453
So, my name is Zhang Jiang,
or Zhang Ji-ang if said slowly.

276
00:18:49,553 --> 00:18:50,607
True.

277
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:51,847
Ying.

278
00:18:52,973 --> 00:18:54,873
You scared me big time.

279
00:18:54,973 --> 00:18:58,020
The whole factory was talking about
how you were hit by a meteor.

280
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,592
I was worried to death.
Got here as soon as I can.

281
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:02,447
I can assure you it's not a meteor.

282
00:19:02,547 --> 00:19:04,667
This is my cousin.
Let me introduce you.

283
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:05,773
Xiaoling.

284
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:07,767
- Yumei.
- Hi, hello.

285
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:09,280
The TVs are here.

286
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:11,300
- TV.
- TV.

287
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Speed up, girl.

288
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,700
Maybe we should take the next one.

289
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,100
Then she'll be late.

290
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,900
Wang Qin and Ying got the only 2 tickets.
And Wang Qin left early.

291
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,000
She doesn't own a TV, either?

292
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,150
- Nope.
- Stand closer.

293
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,350
Get on now.

294
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,550
I can't. Xiaoling.

295
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,700
Try the back.

296
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Sure.

297
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,899
Come on, people, let's scooch.

298
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:48,453
How did we get off?

299
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,447
Ma'am...

300
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:01,347
...do you know where they sell TV?

301
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:02,472
Over there.

302
00:20:02,572 --> 00:20:03,747
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

303
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:04,847
Aunt Qin.

304
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,847
Who would know she's gonna get filthy rich?

305
00:20:10,397 --> 00:20:11,446
TV.

306
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:13,047
Order, everyone.

307
00:20:13,147 --> 00:20:16,247
People who have tickets can go wait
in line. Those who don't, step aside.

308
00:20:19,847 --> 00:20:20,947
Coming through.

309
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:22,147
Slow down.

310
00:20:22,447 --> 00:20:24,147
Tickets only.

311
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:26,373
No tickets, no going in.

312
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:41,633
What a coincidence.

313
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:42,820
I know.

314
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:45,013
We're the only ones with tickets.

315
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,507
Yeah, we can both get one.

316
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,353
- Are we there yet?
- Let me see.

317
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:51,513
Close.

318
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,780
Ying.

319
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,833
I like your shirt.
The blue dots are so cute.

320
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:02,660
- Do I?
- Really? It's simple but elegant.

321
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:06,020
Don't let her.

322
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,259
Wang Qin, there are more dots on the back.

323
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,510
- Not as good as the front.
- The backside is better.

324
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,260
- And your shoes.
- From the factory.

325
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,400
- And that dress.
- You got one too, remember?

326
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:19,367
Li Huanying.

327
00:21:20,067 --> 00:21:21,667
I was actually here first.

328
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:23,987
Then you fell behind waiting in line.

329
00:21:24,373 --> 00:21:26,473
What? I was ahead of you.

330
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,320
I was half-shoulder ahead of you
since the beginning.

331
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,095
Then you tried to push your way up,
which I ignored.

332
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,120
You know? I'm staying right here.

333
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,920
I'm staying right here, too.

334
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,193
Such a funny girl
that she started her own row.

335
00:21:42,293 --> 00:21:45,403
Who would serve her anyway?
I've never seen something like that before.

336
00:21:45,503 --> 00:21:47,320
Do you ever shut up? Li Huanying.

337
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,620
You want a piece of me?

338
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,320
What, you don't think I can take you?

339
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,920
Ladies, please.

340
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,693
Watch your manners.

341
00:21:55,893 --> 00:21:56,900
Look.

342
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,000
There are still ten left.

343
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,327
We can all get one.

344
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:03,333
Eight for the city thermo power plant.

345
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:05,587
I'll take one.

346
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:09,207
- One for me.
- And one for me.

347
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:10,613
That was close.

348
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,620
- Only one left.
- Mine.

349
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,067
- It's mine. Comrade, I'm here first.
- I'm first.

350
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:18,267
A new batch will arrive next week.

351
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:20,840
Maybe one of you can come back next week.

352
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,293
Ying.

353
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:23,587
Let's be fair.

354
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,193
You stand down this week.
And I'll do the same next week.

355
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,220
You wish.

356
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:30,480
Comrade, sell it to me.

357
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,213
Comrades,
how about you both take a step back...

358
00:22:33,313 --> 00:22:35,920
...and leave the TV
to someone who needs it more?

359
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,493
- I'm in dire need of it.
- I need it way more than she does.

360
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:40,640
Comrade...

361
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,747
Comrade...

362
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,433
...excuse me,
is this where you sell TV?

363
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,153
Is it here?

364
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,260
Yeah. Great.

365
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,287
I'll take one.

366
00:22:53,993 --> 00:22:56,800
We only have one left
and it's about to be sold.

367
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,407
Ah, that's too bad.

368
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,927
I've waited so long for this day.

369
00:23:05,727 --> 00:23:09,307
When I was six years old
I lost my eye sight.

370
00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:11,407
How I wish...

371
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:13,773
...I could feel the colorfulness
of the world...

372
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,340
...through this TV set.

373
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:18,153
But...

374
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,567
But...

375
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:21,753
Young lady...

376
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,293
...don't be sad.

377
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,773
Take this.

378
00:23:27,487 --> 00:23:28,493
What is...?

379
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:29,933
This is...

380
00:23:31,307 --> 00:23:32,427
A radio.

381
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:34,993
Compared to TV it suits you better.

382
00:23:35,453 --> 00:23:36,660
You can hear.

383
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,687
I can hear.

384
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:43,773
Now that you put it this way,
I'm not sure what to say now.

385
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,800
Why are you crying?

386
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,800
I'm just thinking...

387
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,100
...thinking about...

388
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
...my brother who is deaf.

389
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,000
He's not as lucky as I am.

390
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,050
You have a deaf brother?

391
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,050
And another one who's missing.

392
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,950
What an unfortunate family.

393
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,480
Comrades...

394
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:25,007
...may I suggest...

395
00:24:25,107 --> 00:24:28,307
...that we let this poor woman buy the TV.

396
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:29,493
Agree?

397
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,200
Well..

398
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,300
I agree.

399
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,600
What about you, Wang Qin?

400
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,900
I agree.

401
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,300
And you?

402
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,600
I agree.
I can't buy one anyone.

403
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,800
Yeah, I agree.

404
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,800
Thank you.

405
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,700
Ticket, please.

406
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,213
Ticket?

407
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:52,240
I need a ticket to buy TV?

408
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,460
Will this kind lady
let me borrow...

409
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,060
...your ticket?

410
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,060
Yeah, Ying.

411
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
Why don't you give her your ticket?

412
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,960
You take the ticket...

413
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,260
...and the money, too.

414
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,160
Look what I got.

415
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,860
The very first TV in our factory.

416
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,060
I got the first one.

417
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,710
- Yumei, watch out, careful.
- I know.

418
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,960
What are you thinking?

419
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,660
Are you happy to see me?

420
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,860
Of course I am.

421
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,760
I can make you even happier.

422
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,053
Good for you, girl.
People should be positive!

423
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:53,860
I'll tell you guys the truth.

424
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,760
That TV Huanying bought
even makes me, the director, jealous.

425
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,860
Of course.

426
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,510
You're not alone on this.
Even the manager would be jealous.

427
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,660
Come on guys, quiet down.

428
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,560
Comrade Huanying
is the first one to own a TV...

429
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,860
...in our factory.

430
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Yeah.

431
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,307
An occasion like this
calls for a speech...

432
00:26:15,613 --> 00:26:18,200
...otherwise it'd feel like
something's missing.

433
00:26:18,307 --> 00:26:19,357
Hear, hear.

434
00:26:19,957 --> 00:26:22,407
- I'll say something then.
- Great.

435
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,807
I'm Ying's cousin...

436
00:26:27,107 --> 00:26:29,457
And I helped her buy the TV.

437
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:33,865
Wang Qin...

438
00:26:34,165 --> 00:26:37,227
...it's only been an afternoon,
what happened to your mouth?

439
00:26:37,327 --> 00:26:39,760
I think, we should all remember that...

440
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:43,067
...Li Huanying is the first
in our factory to get a TV.

441
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:44,170
What?

442
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,473
Is it inflammation?

443
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,460
What inflammation?

444
00:26:48,327 --> 00:26:49,533
It's allergy.

445
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,340
We should always talk about this...

446
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,034
...whenever there's a gathering, such as
your kids getting into college or married.

447
00:26:56,173 --> 00:26:57,173
Yeah!

448
00:27:00,573 --> 00:27:02,173
That's all I have to say.

449
00:27:03,773 --> 00:27:05,733
Well said, Cousin Huanying.

450
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:10,340
I'll just add a few words
to Cousin's speech.

451
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,240
<i>The 3rd FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup.</i>

452
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,290
<i>Team China versus Team Japan...</i>

453
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,940
<i>...at the final competition
for the champion.</i>

454
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,240
<i>And the deciding set is about to kick off.</i>

455
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,840
<i>China's turn to serve.</i>

456
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,040
<i>Number 10, Chen Yaqiong,
is going to serve the ball.</i>

457
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,740
<i>Sun Jinfang, nice pass.
Number 3, Lang Ping.</i>

458
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
<i>And she scores.</i>

459
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,740
<i>Never knew watching TV is this much fun.</i>

460
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,540
<i>China scores with a block.
Sixteen fifteen.</i>

461
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,940
<i>What more can I do to make my mom happier?</i>

462
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,840
<i>Score.
Seventeen fifteen.</i>

463
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,440
<i>China wins.</i>

464
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,740
Guys, quiet, quiet.

465
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,507
While everyone's thrilled
I'd like to make a speech.

466
00:28:02,707 --> 00:28:04,660
To celebrate the victory of team China...

467
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,293
...this year's factory
volleyball tournament...

468
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,100
...will be for women only.

469
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,600
- Let's show them what we got.
- Great!

470
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:33,240
Ying, you got lucky with that TV scheme.

471
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,180
I'll see you...

472
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,607
...on the volleyball court.

473
00:28:38,273 --> 00:28:41,140
Wang Qin.
How serious is this inflammation of yours?

474
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,707
There's no inflammation.

475
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:45,427
I have a sore throat because of my allergy.

476
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:47,373
Not that.

477
00:28:47,753 --> 00:28:49,400
Your breath stinks.

478
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,344
Oops. I thought it was someone's feet.

479
00:28:52,444 --> 00:28:53,508
You smelt it, too.

480
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:54,712
It almost killed me.

481
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,433
I dare you to touch me again.

482
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,300
It's not her game to call.

483
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:03,047
We don't have to go.

484
00:29:03,147 --> 00:29:04,150
Right.

485
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,653
Let's not indulge her.

486
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,207
You done?

487
00:29:08,653 --> 00:29:09,667
Let's go.

488
00:29:11,487 --> 00:29:13,987
<i>If we hadn't missed that game...</i>

489
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:15,487
...she wouldn't have won.

490
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,560
What would my mom have won?

491
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:19,300
A life-changing opportunity.

492
00:29:20,407 --> 00:29:23,087
<i>I will not let mom's big opportunity
slip away.</i>

493
00:29:24,507 --> 00:29:28,107
Ying, I think you should attend
the volleyball tournament this year.

494
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:29,313
Why?

495
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:32,027
Didn't you hear the director?
"Let's show them what we got."

496
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,727
That's just his catch phrase.

497
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:37,307
Sir, wanna go grab a drink later?

498
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,727
Absolutely.

499
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,887
Let's show them what we got. Go.

500
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,013
See.

501
00:29:43,953 --> 00:29:45,653
Just trust me on this one.

502
00:29:45,753 --> 00:29:48,180
Something great will happen
if you win this year.

503
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:49,467
Ling...

504
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:53,007
...we've been here for more then ten years.

505
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,753
I think we'd know
if it'd be something great.

506
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,873
Yeah.

507
00:29:56,973 --> 00:30:00,110
Ling, you don't come here very often.
Let me show you a good time.

508
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,253
Just tell me what you want to do.

509
00:30:03,013 --> 00:30:04,613
I want to see you play volleyball.

510
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,353
Okay, Yumei.

511
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,167
Tell the girls to come tomorrow.

512
00:30:10,087 --> 00:30:12,027
Have you got no principle at all?

513
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,100
Where are the rest of the team?

514
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,780
They all have problems to deal with.

515
00:30:24,887 --> 00:30:27,787
Did you not make it clear
that this time is different?

516
00:30:27,887 --> 00:30:30,873
I did make it clear.
It couldn't have been more clearer.

517
00:30:30,987 --> 00:30:34,133
I even told them that if they don't show
up, no one's gonna beg them to come.

518
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:37,687
And that they should never show
their faces again. No show.

519
00:30:38,387 --> 00:30:41,487
Yumei, my dear,
you never fail to impress me.

520
00:30:41,993 --> 00:30:43,000
I'll go.

521
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:46,207
Maybe Yumei wasn't convincing enough.

522
00:30:46,653 --> 00:30:48,193
If I go myself...

523
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:51,853
...the girls would at least
show me some respect.

524
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,627
Can't play.

525
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,993
End of the harvest season is days away.
I won't be able to make it.

526
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,360
Indeed.

527
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,213
Yumei told me.

528
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,747
But...

529
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:10,793
I came to you myself.

530
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,100
What difference does that make?

531
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,900
You guys are so funny,
taking turns to come.

532
00:31:21,693 --> 00:31:23,393
I'm actually quite busy.

533
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,193
<i>I went to sleep fine...</i>

534
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,280
...and woke up like this.

535
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:35,353
The first half of the night
I couldn't seem to get up.

536
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,307
Like I was possessed or something.

537
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,060
Then the second half, I finally got up...

538
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,880
...and then my hair was gone.

539
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,053
It's OK.

540
00:31:44,173 --> 00:31:45,927
It'll grow back in no time.

541
00:31:46,033 --> 00:31:48,407
You know what,
turn around and let me see.

542
00:31:49,013 --> 00:31:50,213
Is it obvious?

543
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,667
I wouldn't say so.

544
00:31:58,867 --> 00:32:00,300
What do you think?

545
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:02,210
Right.

546
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,733
If you don't look closely...

547
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,173
If you don't look closely...

548
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,780
How can I possibly not look closely?

549
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,980
How can I possibly go out again?

550
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,180
I don't have time for volleyball now.

551
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,330
I'm trying to get the factory
to approve this new program.

552
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,430
It's called Poems by Yanhua.

553
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,080
How I'm under a lot of pressure
as an artist.

554
00:32:34,147 --> 00:32:35,947
I gave up sport to become a poet.

555
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:42,346
She never even went to school.

556
00:32:44,647 --> 00:32:46,647
You have foreigners working here?

557
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:49,493
She's from Inner Mongolia.

558
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,099
Her grandfather moved here
from the Soviet Union.

559
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,320
Let me introduce you.
This is Mao Qin.

560
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,460
Sister Mao.

561
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,100
Don't call me sister.

562
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,150
That's for strangers.
Just call me Muscovite.

563
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,600
Where's my uncle?

564
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,800
He's out.

565
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,900
He still goes scavenging for junks?

566
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,313
He does it as an exercise.

567
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,420
Right.

568
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,527
Mao Qin.

569
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,260
We're here to talk to you about
training.

570
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,360
I can't do it.
I'm starting a business.

571
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,760
I'll tell you something. I went to school
with this guy, Zhang Kaifen...

572
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,553
...who got super rich
selling nothing but tea.

573
00:33:33,653 --> 00:33:37,653
If someone like him could make money,
why can't I?

574
00:33:38,453 --> 00:33:41,247
- Indeed you should make some money.
- Right?

575
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,393
What business will you start?

576
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,690
Something that requires
minimum investment or effort...

577
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,140
...but is lucrative.

578
00:33:53,013 --> 00:33:54,413
They are not coming.

579
00:33:54,513 --> 00:33:57,327
And it has nothing to do
with how convincing you are.

580
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,137
Yumei, your little speech
is not helpful at all.

581
00:34:02,437 --> 00:34:04,733
Ling, there's nothing I can do.

582
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,413
I don't think we have to play
under such circumstance.

583
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,640
We really don't have to.

584
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,233
I don't get it. Why did you have to do
this in the first place?

585
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,293
My cousin was making a big deal of it.

586
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,147
You guys are not unwilling to play.

587
00:34:22,053 --> 00:34:23,880
You're just afraid to lose.

588
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:25,567
Am I right?

589
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,113
You hate losing to Wang Qin.

590
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,887
But you know what?

591
00:34:28,993 --> 00:34:32,327
If you lose this time,
you'll probably be losers for life.

592
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,823
Reverse psychology...

593
00:34:41,923 --> 00:34:43,087
...doesn't seem to work.

594
00:34:44,987 --> 00:34:46,537
This trick, I'm telling you.

595
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,387
Who is Jia Xiaoling?

596
00:35:03,787 --> 00:35:05,047
Who is Jia Xiaoling?

597
00:35:05,153 --> 00:35:06,267
Which one of you?

598
00:35:06,973 --> 00:35:07,973
You?

599
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,887
You are Jia Xiaoling?

600
00:35:14,953 --> 00:35:17,553
- Just as you pointed out.
- Boss, say no more.

601
00:35:17,853 --> 00:35:19,460
I'm not even finished.

602
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:23,313
We came to you because Wang...

603
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:27,147
What's Wang Shoufeng's sister's name again?

604
00:35:27,347 --> 00:35:28,353
Wang Qin.

605
00:35:28,653 --> 00:35:30,173
Do you know Wang Qin?

606
00:35:30,527 --> 00:35:31,853
Yeah.

607
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,273
We're good friends.

608
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,587
Why?

609
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:36,933
Did you take her TV?

610
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:39,233
We didn't.

611
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,833
- You're a really good liar, you know that?
- Let me finish.

612
00:35:43,833 --> 00:35:46,340
Boss, I'm upset that you
won't let me join the action.

613
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:53,433
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Leng Te...

614
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,467
...and this factory is my turf.

615
00:35:55,573 --> 00:35:58,200
If you are smart enough
you'd give the TV back.

616
00:35:58,607 --> 00:36:02,367
If you don't that's fine.
I'll just deal with it my way.

617
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:10,193
You got five seconds to decide.

618
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:12,067
Five...

619
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:14,167
No, this is a misunderstanding.

620
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:15,267
Four...

621
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:17,667
Three...

622
00:36:18,267 --> 00:36:19,267
Two...

623
00:36:24,567 --> 00:36:25,567
Boss.

624
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:27,567
- Boss.
- Help me.

625
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:31,017
- What are you looking at? Go rescue him.
- You go first, I snapped my toe nails.

626
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:33,667
My horse...

627
00:36:33,767 --> 00:36:34,967
...my chariot. My horse.

628
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,167
My carriage.

629
00:36:37,427 --> 00:36:40,693
How could Wang Qin do this?
Sending those thugs to threaten us.

630
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:44,667
We have to attend this tournament
and we have to win.

631
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,027
That'll crash Wang Qin.

632
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:47,167
Great!

633
00:36:47,267 --> 00:36:49,527
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Right?

634
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:52,753
But we're short of hands.
They are all occupied.

635
00:36:53,553 --> 00:36:56,390
We'll help them solve their problems first.

636
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,490
How...

637
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,493
Ling knows how.

638
00:37:01,947 --> 00:37:04,240
Me? How should I know?

639
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,567
Where are you going?

640
00:37:08,873 --> 00:37:11,473
All yours now.
You are such a good friend.

641
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:18,973
I don't want it.

642
00:37:19,073 --> 00:37:20,473
What stupid therapy is this?

643
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:21,898
I'm not doing it.

644
00:37:21,998 --> 00:37:23,473
What choices do you have?

645
00:37:23,773 --> 00:37:26,073
You're not married yet.

646
00:37:27,273 --> 00:37:30,823
Mommy, do you think my hair
would ever grow back?

647
00:37:31,523 --> 00:37:32,973
If it doesn't grow back...

648
00:37:33,173 --> 00:37:36,673
...mom will be here for you
for the rest of your life.

649
00:37:37,073 --> 00:37:38,673
Mommy...

650
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:47,267
How about now?
Can't tell the difference, can you?

651
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:49,967
It works.
Not bald anymore.

652
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:54,017
I shouldn't go out
and walk him anymore, right?

653
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:58,367
As long as you two are not out together.

654
00:37:58,467 --> 00:37:59,467
Exactly.

655
00:38:02,067 --> 00:38:03,467
Give me ten more.

656
00:38:03,567 --> 00:38:04,567
Here.

657
00:38:08,817 --> 00:38:11,567
Ling, this is way more profitable
than my dad's scavenging business.

658
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:17,867
Now all that's left are
Yawen's rice paddies.

659
00:38:18,267 --> 00:38:20,667
Once we're done reaping,
we can play some volleyball.

660
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:34,067
There are still a lot.
When will we ever finish reaping?

661
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:40,917
Yumei.

662
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:43,167
Where did Ling go?

663
00:38:43,467 --> 00:38:46,767
To get help.
Said we need more hands on deck.

664
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:49,167
Who else could she get?

665
00:38:50,067 --> 00:38:53,953
Then, Chan Ho Nam and Chicken rose
to fame overnight in the final combat...

666
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,507
...and the city was
the Hung Hing Gang's to rule.

667
00:38:58,513 --> 00:39:03,473
That means, all of us
are to be known as Goo Wak Chai.

668
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,947
Bingo.

669
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:09,333
Right, that Chan Ho Nam you mentioned,
what's his other name again?

670
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,267
Zheng Yijian.

671
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,120
I Can Change?

672
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:17,387
That's one badass name.

673
00:39:18,293 --> 00:39:21,693
Boss, you think he's related
to our town butcher...

674
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:23,207
...Aye Don Cheng?

675
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,087
Possibly.

676
00:39:27,313 --> 00:39:28,313
Boss.

677
00:39:28,413 --> 00:39:30,860
We should go to the city and join them.

678
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,553
Maybe you can introduce us.

679
00:39:35,653 --> 00:39:36,747
No probs.

680
00:39:36,947 --> 00:39:39,667
Thank you for sharing
all that information.

681
00:39:39,867 --> 00:39:42,357
From now on, we're friends.

682
00:39:42,657 --> 00:39:44,233
BFF, if you please.

683
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,893
Just let us know...

684
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:49,587
...if you're ever in need
and we'll help.

685
00:39:51,187 --> 00:39:53,187
Didn't expect you to come to us so soon.

686
00:39:53,287 --> 00:39:55,087
You three, get this area covered.

687
00:39:57,587 --> 00:39:58,587
Ling.

688
00:39:58,687 --> 00:39:59,687
Just reap.

689
00:40:02,187 --> 00:40:04,437
<i>Today, Comrade Li Fenjin...</i>

690
00:40:04,537 --> 00:40:07,087
<i>...returned to the factory
after a three-year excursion.</i>

691
00:40:07,187 --> 00:40:09,887
<i>When seeing his co-workers
for the first time in so long.</i>

692
00:40:10,187 --> 00:40:12,187
<i>Li burst into tears.</i>

693
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:16,387
<i>Now Comrade Zhao Yanhua from the workshop
will perform one of her original poems.</i>

694
00:40:16,487 --> 00:40:19,237
<i>"Mr. Li, Crying Is Not A Crime"</i>

695
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:22,687
<i>Yanhua's original poems.
Ling wrote it for her.</i>

696
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:25,187
Mr. Li.

697
00:40:25,587 --> 00:40:28,887
You can cry, for crying...

698
00:40:28,987 --> 00:40:30,787
<i>...is not a crime.</i>

699
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:33,187
<i>Have a taste of the...</i>

700
00:40:33,287 --> 00:40:35,287
...long overdue tears.

701
00:40:35,887 --> 00:40:39,687
<i>Reunited with former co-workers, Lao Liu...</i>

702
00:40:39,787 --> 00:40:41,087
<i>...Lao Zhang...</i>

703
00:40:41,287 --> 00:40:42,537
<i>...and Lao Wei.</i>

704
00:40:42,637 --> 00:40:46,837
<i>You should take the chance...</i>

705
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:50,187
...and let out all your tears.

706
00:40:50,487 --> 00:40:52,487
My dear fellow factory workers...

707
00:40:52,787 --> 00:40:54,987
...I've missed you so much!

708
00:41:25,257 --> 00:41:26,257
Let me.

709
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:28,107
Good game.

710
00:41:38,007 --> 00:41:39,407
That was amazing.

711
00:41:39,707 --> 00:41:41,707
Except for Yumei, she's the weak link.

712
00:41:41,807 --> 00:41:43,407
She's the worst.

713
00:41:43,607 --> 00:41:45,007
But you know what?

714
00:41:45,307 --> 00:41:46,407
Someone...

715
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:48,507
...doesn't think so.

716
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:50,207
Who?

717
00:41:50,707 --> 00:41:52,007
Herself.

718
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,093
Yumei, come on.

719
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,467
We must win.

720
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:00,833
Relax.

721
00:42:00,933 --> 00:42:02,433
We will be the winners.

722
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,160
Bone fracture.

723
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,913
That last move cased it.

724
00:42:14,047 --> 00:42:15,053
That last move cased it.

725
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,927
You're just helpless.

726
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,607
Why did you do that last move?

727
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:23,453
Looks like we're not going
to the tournament.

728
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:30,313
<i>Triumph Chemical Factory's...</i>

729
00:42:30,413 --> 00:42:34,713
<i>...very first Women's Volleyball Tournament
is about to kick off.</i>

730
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:37,863
<i>Now, let's give a warm round of applause...</i>

731
00:42:37,963 --> 00:42:41,013
<i>...for players of both teams.</i>

732
00:42:56,013 --> 00:42:57,313
Ling.

733
00:42:57,413 --> 00:42:58,413
Come on.

734
00:43:08,613 --> 00:43:11,463
Ying, don't you think your team name
is a bit too much?

735
00:43:14,013 --> 00:43:16,263
Well, we are the forging workshop.

736
00:43:17,013 --> 00:43:19,813
What's wrong with
representing ourselves?

737
00:43:37,113 --> 00:43:38,513
Ying, Ying.

738
00:43:38,913 --> 00:43:40,913
- The manager's here.
- Yeah, he is.

739
00:43:41,013 --> 00:43:42,363
This is a huge event indeed.

740
00:43:42,563 --> 00:43:43,913
So, can we win?

741
00:43:45,813 --> 00:43:46,913
Relax.

742
00:43:47,013 --> 00:43:48,013
No probs.

743
00:43:48,513 --> 00:43:50,613
<i>It gives me great pleasure
to announce that...</i>

744
00:43:50,713 --> 00:43:53,563
<i>...our factory manager is here today.</i>

745
00:43:53,663 --> 00:43:56,913
<i>Sir, would you do the honor
of addressing the audience?</i>

746
00:43:57,013 --> 00:43:58,213
Bravo!

747
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,287
<i>The game now begins.</i>

748
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,020
Bravo.

749
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,120
You serve first. Here.

750
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,270
Keep moving, girls, come on.

751
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,670
Come on!

752
00:45:16,373 --> 00:45:17,373
What is it?

753
00:45:18,073 --> 00:45:19,173
What happened?

754
00:45:19,273 --> 00:45:20,373
Her hair dropped off.

755
00:45:27,823 --> 00:45:28,824
No.

756
00:45:28,924 --> 00:45:30,123
Hell no.

757
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:32,773
Guixiang.

758
00:45:38,173 --> 00:45:40,023
Timeout before the game even starts?

759
00:45:45,273 --> 00:45:46,833
Totally unnecessary.

760
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:49,407
Ling, you have really strong hands.

761
00:45:49,507 --> 00:45:50,707
I didn't mean to do that.

762
00:45:50,807 --> 00:45:52,984
Fortunately, we found out about it now.

763
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,860
Any time later and we're done for.

764
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:56,300
Let's just quit.

765
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:59,157
Come on now, we must stay in the game.

766
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:02,207
Ling, it's not that we won't help you.

767
00:46:02,307 --> 00:46:04,560
You see, there aren't enough people.

768
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:06,220
- Indeed.
- That's true.

769
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,447
Okay, that's enough.

770
00:46:08,147 --> 00:46:10,700
Ling. Quick, go get Guixiang.

771
00:46:11,247 --> 00:46:13,267
- What about them?
- I'll talk to them.

772
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:18,147
Coming through.

773
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,553
What is this?

774
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,773
So, Xiaoling helped you with all your
chores and now you're quitting on her?

775
00:46:28,693 --> 00:46:30,493
Ling.

776
00:46:30,893 --> 00:46:33,073
- Where are you going?
- Guixiang left.

777
00:46:33,173 --> 00:46:35,273
Everyone else is giving up.
I have to find her now.

778
00:46:35,373 --> 00:46:37,473
But if you leave now,
we'll be even more shorthanded.

779
00:46:37,573 --> 00:46:38,673
Then what do we do?

780
00:46:38,773 --> 00:46:40,673
We'll go get her.
You back and talk to them.

781
00:46:40,773 --> 00:46:41,873
- Go.
- OK.

782
00:46:42,673 --> 00:46:43,773
Hurry up.

783
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:49,873
Don't worry.

784
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,473
I'll bring them back.

785
00:46:51,573 --> 00:46:53,893
If not, the five of us can play anyway.

786
00:46:57,513 --> 00:46:58,580
Where's Guixiang?

787
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,807
Yumei went to get her.

788
00:46:59,907 --> 00:47:00,934
- Great.
- Ling.

789
00:47:01,034 --> 00:47:05,040
Now we're one player short and you're the
rookie so just stay away from the ball...

790
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,053
- ...and don't get in our way, get it?
- Right.

791
00:47:07,153 --> 00:47:08,157
Come on.

792
00:47:09,707 --> 00:47:11,513
How did you convince them?

793
00:47:12,733 --> 00:47:16,113
- They always look up to me.
- Come on, seriously.

794
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,773
I promised to lend them the TV for a week.

795
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,273
Come on.

796
00:47:25,673 --> 00:47:27,923
Let's kick their asses now.

797
00:47:28,023 --> 00:47:29,473
And we'll watch TV together.

798
00:47:29,573 --> 00:47:31,373
Alright, let's do this.

799
00:47:35,373 --> 00:47:36,373
Ying.

800
00:47:43,973 --> 00:47:44,973
Mine.

801
00:47:47,173 --> 00:47:48,372
What's the score now?

802
00:47:49,873 --> 00:47:51,173
I can't see anything.

803
00:47:51,873 --> 00:47:53,173
He's like a mountain.

804
00:48:00,473 --> 00:48:02,373
Xiaoling sure is giving it all she got.

805
00:48:02,473 --> 00:48:03,473
Totally.

806
00:48:03,573 --> 00:48:05,173
Otherwise we'd have scored more points.

807
00:48:24,573 --> 00:48:27,173
We're one point away from winning.
Pass me the next ball.

808
00:48:27,273 --> 00:48:28,273
I know.

809
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,613
Comrade Huanying...

810
00:48:41,907 --> 00:48:44,820
...if you feel like you can't go on
I can end the game now.

811
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,620
I have the power.

812
00:48:51,993 --> 00:48:52,993
Referee.

813
00:48:53,493 --> 00:48:55,293
Number 13 in.

814
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,500
No.

815
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,100
God, it's over.

816
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,200
Guixiang.

817
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,100
What is she doing here?

818
00:49:41,927 --> 00:49:43,127
That's OK.

819
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:45,127
It's just a game.

820
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,953
<i>If we hadn't missed that game...</i>

821
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:57,853
<i>...she wouldn't have won.
It would've totally been your mother.</i>

822
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:16,513
Use your hands.

823
00:50:45,013 --> 00:50:47,613
The Forger Ladies have got
some spirit in them.

824
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:51,513
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

825
00:50:51,613 --> 00:50:52,713
Keep playing like this.

826
00:50:52,813 --> 00:50:54,513
Come on, girls!
We can do it!

827
00:50:54,613 --> 00:50:56,813
They act like they've won the game.

828
00:50:56,913 --> 00:50:57,919
Li Huanying.

829
00:51:01,107 --> 00:51:04,900
If we get one more point,
we will win the game.

830
00:51:07,093 --> 00:51:08,300
Don't touch the net.

831
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,927
Wang Qin.

832
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:13,907
You underestimated us.

833
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,887
They don't call me Little Iron Hammer
for nothing.

834
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,419
It has just gotten interesting!

835
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,520
Who's that girl?

836
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,320
Li Huanying from factory branch one.

837
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,920
Not bad.

838
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,720
Have you noticed?

839
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,570
People give off a certain radiance...

840
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,320
...when they refuse to give up.

841
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,320
Mine.

842
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,720
Where do you think you're going?

843
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,220
Referee.

844
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,220
That one was out of bounds.

845
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,570
No way. It landed right on the line.

846
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:45,020
How could it be? I was close enough
to see everything. It was out.

847
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,270
- OK, I'll be more careful next time.
- No, next time won't do.

848
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:50,670
Go explain to the manager now,
so we can start over.

849
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:52,820
Now you're just making trouble.
How about this?

850
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,920
I give you one point, making it even.
I'll give you all those three points.

851
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,620
I don't want three points.
I want you to go talk to the manager.

852
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,920
And we'll play for it again.

853
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,820
- This game means everything to me.
- I'm not a pro, I'm just a cook.

854
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,320
They called me at the last minute.

855
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:05,820
Why don't you get off my back?

856
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,420
I'm dying of jealousy.

857
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,820
In previous years,
only the 1st place would receive this.

858
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,720
This year, it's like you
just have to be here.

859
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,020
They're being really generous.

860
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,920
This is a nice mug, even comes with a lid.

861
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,620
This mug is meaningful.

862
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,070
How great is this?

863
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,420
Ling, you're so awesome.

864
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:25,820
We'd have agreed to play immediately
if you had told us at first.

865
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,020
Indeed.

866
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,620
I didn't mean that.

867
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,020
<i>Now, the manager will present
the award to team Forger Ladies.</i>

868
00:53:40,847 --> 00:53:42,093
Unbelievable.

869
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,567
Just a flashlight for the winning team?

870
00:53:45,673 --> 00:53:47,173
I didn't think it's possible, either.

871
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,247
But that's what they did.

872
00:53:49,453 --> 00:53:51,393
Do you think the factory
is generous this year?

873
00:53:51,547 --> 00:53:53,107
They truly are.

874
00:53:55,013 --> 00:53:58,913
The final champions
don't even get promoted...

875
00:53:59,013 --> 00:54:02,307
...or life-changing opportunities?
Nothing like that?

876
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,020
No.

877
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,340
Xiaoling, what were you thinking?
It's not like we played in the Asian Games.

878
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,240
Even for that we won't get promoted.

879
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,443
- Maybe the Olympics.
- Not even the Olympics.

880
00:54:11,643 --> 00:54:12,673
Trust me.

881
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,007
That's enough.

882
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,020
Look at you.

883
00:54:21,027 --> 00:54:22,507
The director's here.

884
00:54:22,713 --> 00:54:24,873
Huanying, come. I need to talk to you.

885
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,000
Shut the door.

886
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,407
I'm not going.

887
00:54:36,013 --> 00:54:38,687
This is a factory mission.
You must go.

888
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,393
Just do it as a favor to me.

889
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,573
Deal.

890
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,160
What mission?

891
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,720
Perhaps I can take your place.

892
00:54:52,227 --> 00:54:53,593
It's an arranged date.

893
00:54:53,693 --> 00:54:54,720
You go.

894
00:54:56,053 --> 00:54:57,220
My dad.

895
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,600
Hello.

896
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,300
My name is Shen Guanglin.

897
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,633
Uncle Guanglin.

898
00:55:14,067 --> 00:55:15,473
And you are...

899
00:55:15,707 --> 00:55:16,707
Li Huanying.

900
00:55:17,207 --> 00:55:18,307
I'm not--

901
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,980
Wait, who said you can come in?

902
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:29,187
Ying.

903
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:35,907
Shen Guanglin?

904
00:55:36,013 --> 00:55:37,260
The manager's son.

905
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,267
How can it be Shen Guanglin?

906
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:42,317
They're made for each other.

907
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:43,767
What are you talking about?

908
00:55:43,867 --> 00:55:46,517
If they get together, I'll be damned.

909
00:55:47,017 --> 00:55:49,807
If they get together,
you're the one to thank.

910
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,327
How is that?

911
00:55:52,813 --> 00:55:56,380
Weren't you the one who pushed Ying
to attend the volleyball tournament?

912
00:55:56,573 --> 00:55:57,873
Is she didn't go..

913
00:55:57,973 --> 00:56:01,293
...the manager wouldn't have fancied her
to be his future daughter-in-law.

914
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,980
If Ying didn't show up,
the manager would've picked...

915
00:56:06,973 --> 00:56:08,073
...Fengzhi?

916
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:12,453
No way, you don't think that Fengzhi,
likes look an eggplant?

917
00:56:12,553 --> 00:56:13,987
You're one to talk.

918
00:56:14,387 --> 00:56:16,333
What about Shuxian?

919
00:56:16,433 --> 00:56:18,633
Like she doesn't look like a potato.

920
00:56:18,733 --> 00:56:21,183
Whenever I make fun of Shuxian
you always act like this.

921
00:56:21,283 --> 00:56:23,183
Shuxian definitely does not look
like a potato.

922
00:56:23,283 --> 00:56:25,593
Who else could've been picked
if not Fengzhi?

923
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,880
I don't know.

924
00:56:28,347 --> 00:56:29,767
Should be Wang Qin.

925
00:56:32,413 --> 00:56:34,840
She wouldn't be so lucky
in a million years.

926
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,953
Speaking of lucky.

927
00:56:43,347 --> 00:56:47,227
Dinner's cancelled.
Boss's mom was rushed to the hospital.

928
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:48,693
What are you doing here?

929
00:56:49,693 --> 00:56:52,993
Ask yourself, when have you
ever not worried your mother?

930
00:56:53,713 --> 00:56:56,412
If it weren't for you,
she wouldn't be in the hospital?

931
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,527
Get away.

932
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:08,133
<i>What did the doctor say?</i>

933
00:57:09,527 --> 00:57:10,807
<i>It's serious.</i>

934
00:57:13,453 --> 00:57:15,560
I'm sure she will be fine.

935
00:57:23,007 --> 00:57:25,867
Would you believe me if I told you
I know exactly how you feel?

936
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,107
That's not possible.

937
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,293
I'm nothing like you.

938
00:57:32,467 --> 00:57:35,180
My mom has never stopped worrying
ever since I was born.

939
00:57:36,433 --> 00:57:39,233
And, I've never done anything that...

940
00:57:39,973 --> 00:57:41,753
...made her happy.

941
00:57:42,773 --> 00:57:44,293
My dad is right.

942
00:57:45,787 --> 00:57:47,427
If it weren't for me...

943
00:57:49,053 --> 00:57:51,460
...my mom wouldn't have been
in this condition.

944
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,100
<i>Sometimes I wonder...</i>

945
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,027
<i>...if I weren't her son...</i>

946
00:58:04,873 --> 00:58:07,353
<i>...she would've lived a better life.</i>

947
00:58:14,653 --> 00:58:16,303
How's she?

948
00:58:17,553 --> 00:58:19,753
- The surgery was a success.
- Thank you.

949
00:58:20,053 --> 00:58:21,553
Thank you, doctor.

950
00:58:21,753 --> 00:58:23,313
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

951
00:58:40,407 --> 00:58:41,607
<i>1981.</i>

952
00:58:42,407 --> 00:58:43,907
I wasn't even born yet.

953
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:45,507
I can't do anything.

954
00:58:45,607 --> 00:58:47,507
How did I wind up here?

955
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:51,157
<i>Weren't you the one who pushed Ying
to attend the volleyball tournament?</i>

956
00:58:52,007 --> 00:58:53,207
<i>Is she didn't go...</i>

957
00:58:53,307 --> 00:58:56,307
<i>...the manager wouldn't have fancied her

958
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,807

959
00:58:57,907 --> 00:59:00,307
<i>She wouldn't be so lucky

960
00:59:00,407 --> 00:59:03,257
<i>My daughter Tingting is going
to study in the United States.</i>

961
00:59:03,357 --> 00:59:05,557
<i>At UCLA.</i>

962
00:59:06,257 --> 00:59:08,757
<i>When will you ever make me proud?</i>

963
00:59:11,407 --> 00:59:15,857
<i>And, I've never done anything

971
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:07,933
That's what standard Cantonese sounds like.
I've sung it four times. You got it?

972
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,920
Still no?

973
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:12,493
You sounded different each time.

974
01:00:14,827 --> 01:00:15,920
Aunt Wang.

975
01:00:16,127 --> 01:00:19,187
You've been here all this time?
Did I sound different every time.

976
01:00:19,293 --> 01:00:23,107
That's the way it's supposed to be.
There are four different songs.

977
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:26,900
That's enough, go mind you own business.

978
01:00:27,047 --> 01:00:28,467
Move your feet then.

979
01:00:30,273 --> 01:00:32,973
Let's sort out the lyrics,
Young Master Shen.

980
01:00:35,373 --> 01:00:38,787
Anyone who wants to quit,
now is your time to leave.

981
01:00:39,893 --> 01:00:43,313
Don't force yourselves to work with me
because I'm the manager's son.

982
01:00:43,927 --> 01:00:45,673
Let me tell you something.

983
01:00:45,827 --> 01:00:48,993
As of next month,
my dad is no longer the manager.

984
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:56,607
He'll be promoted to the party chief.
Why don't you go inside?

985
01:00:56,713 --> 01:00:58,673
What are you sitting out here for?

986
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,633
In my opinion,
we should all work harder.

987
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,700
The show is just a few days away.

988
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,860
Aye.

989
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:09,233
Comrades, let's get serious.

990
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,424
OK.

991
01:01:10,524 --> 01:01:11,607
OK.

992
01:01:12,013 --> 01:01:13,017
Hi.

993
01:01:13,913 --> 01:01:15,907
Are you Shen Guangin?

994
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,347
Hi.

995
01:01:17,547 --> 01:01:19,427
Could I talk to you in private
for a minute?

996
01:01:19,533 --> 01:01:22,360
Whatever it is, we can talk here.
I have to coach these people.

997
01:01:25,347 --> 01:01:27,247
I understand you went on a date yesterday--

998
01:01:27,347 --> 01:01:29,347
- And I think...
- Well. Let's talk...

999
01:01:29,647 --> 01:01:30,967
...over here in private. Come on.

1000
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:33,927
<i>And you are...</i>

1001
01:01:34,033 --> 01:01:37,227
- ...from Women's Federation?
- I'm Li Huanying's cousin.

1002
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,227
Cousin who works for Women's Federation.

1003
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,307
Not that.

1004
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:46,700
I came to ask you
how you feel about Li Huanying.

1005
01:01:47,107 --> 01:01:49,020
If you like her...

1006
01:01:49,153 --> 01:01:50,293
I can help.

1007
01:01:56,107 --> 01:01:58,907
My meeting with comrade Li Huanying...

1008
01:01:59,453 --> 01:02:01,253
...was arranged by my father.

1009
01:02:01,953 --> 01:02:03,220
What do you mean?

1010
01:02:03,927 --> 01:02:06,577
You have no idea
what kind a man my father is.

1011
01:02:07,527 --> 01:02:08,720
Let me put it this way.

1012
01:02:08,827 --> 01:02:10,000
Growing up...

1013
01:02:10,107 --> 01:02:12,107
...be it school, work...

1014
01:02:12,207 --> 01:02:15,420
...or dating,
he made the choice for me every time.

1015
01:02:17,093 --> 01:02:19,153
And I'd like for once choose for myself.

1016
01:02:21,067 --> 01:02:22,180
I see.

1017
01:02:23,387 --> 01:02:24,893
Sorry to bother you.

1018
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,327
Bye.

1019
01:02:36,467 --> 01:02:37,980
Is today Wednesday?

1020
01:02:40,313 --> 01:02:42,167
It's really Wednesday, oh god.

1021
01:02:42,573 --> 01:02:43,720
Wednesday?

1022
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,807
Are we rehearsing or not?

1023
01:02:49,213 --> 01:02:51,280
He booked us for Wednesday, right?

1024
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,407
Comrade Cousin...

1025
01:02:53,007 --> 01:02:54,113
...wait up.

1026
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:57,867
What?

1027
01:02:58,807 --> 01:03:01,060
Earlier, we were surrounded by a crowd...

1028
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:04,393
...so I don't think
you got my point clearly.

1029
01:03:04,627 --> 01:03:06,167
I got it alright.

1030
01:03:06,427 --> 01:03:08,810
Your date with Ying was arranged
by you father...

1031
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,693
...and you'd like to make your own choices.

1032
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,987
See. You didn't get it.

1033
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:18,580
This time, it was my own choice, and
I asked my father to set up the meeting.

1034
01:03:21,513 --> 01:03:24,520
You mean, you really like Ying?

1035
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,173
I'm in love with her.

1036
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:42,340
What?

1037
01:03:43,927 --> 01:03:44,933
It's OK.

1038
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:46,620
Rain will come.

1039
01:03:48,267 --> 01:03:49,273
Yeah.

1040
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,207
Rain will come, and mom will be mom.

1041
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,167
You can't change the law of natural.

1042
01:03:55,473 --> 01:03:56,473
Right.

1043
01:03:57,353 --> 01:04:00,287
You mentioned
that you can help me pursue Ying.

1044
01:04:01,293 --> 01:04:02,333
How?

1045
01:04:06,727 --> 01:04:10,180
These seats are next to each other,
just pretend it's a coincidence.

1046
01:04:13,093 --> 01:04:14,100
Thanks.

1047
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,087
See you later.

1048
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:51,540
Ying.

1049
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,340
What are you doing here?

1050
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,740
Come with me.

1051
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:58,940
- For what?
- For some fun.

1052
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,140
You like it?

1053
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,640
It's hideous.

1054
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,540
Not if it goes with this,
suits you perfectly.

1055
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,240
- I don't want it.
- You should wear bright color more often.

1056
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,340
I hate it. Don't make me wear this.

1057
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,640
I'm done.

1058
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:17,740
Don't waste it.

1059
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:26,340
They don't fit.

1060
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:29,740
I'm not wearing these, it looks stupid.

1061
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,540
What shoes are these?

1062
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,940
Thank you.

1063
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:37,040
Dinner's ready.

1064
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:06,090
Ying.

1065
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:12,840
You've been waiting?

1066
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:21,090
Ling, am I over-dressed coming to
the movies with you looking like this?

1067
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,340
You look stunning.

1068
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,640
Ling.

1069
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:26,840
I was looking all over for you.
It's urgent, you must come with me now.

1070
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:28,741
What is it?

1071
01:06:28,841 --> 01:06:31,390
Please let me borrow her for a while,
we'll be back in no time.

1072
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:33,740
Not that.
What's the emergency?

1073
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,740
I'll come with you, maybe I can help.

1074
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:39,193
I have an emergency.

1075
01:06:39,393 --> 01:06:41,093
It's urgent.

1076
01:06:41,493 --> 01:06:43,493
No need. Why don't you go in first?

1077
01:06:43,593 --> 01:06:45,727
I'll go with him and come back
to you once we're done.

1078
01:06:46,493 --> 01:06:49,813
- I'll come right back.
- It's about to start, be quick.

1079
01:06:49,913 --> 01:06:51,260
- No worries.
- Come on.

1080
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,347
Excuse me.

1081
01:07:44,653 --> 01:07:46,053
You're here, too.

1082
01:07:47,453 --> 01:07:48,927
Here for the movie?

1083
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,267
Thank you for this.

1084
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,213
It's OK.

1085
01:08:09,887 --> 01:08:12,400
I didn't think my acting was
convincing enough, though.

1086
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,667
What are you talking about?
Of course your acting's not perfect.

1087
01:08:15,907 --> 01:08:17,613
It's not like you learned how to act.

1088
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:24,480
What?

1089
01:08:25,507 --> 01:08:26,507
Nothing.

1090
01:08:26,907 --> 01:08:28,306
Rain will come.

1091
01:08:30,987 --> 01:08:32,527
Why are you laughing?

1092
01:08:33,347 --> 01:08:35,273
Nothing. I just realized that...

1093
01:08:35,927 --> 01:08:38,627
Rain will come,
and mom will be mom.

1094
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:43,360
- What's so funny about that?
- What?

1095
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:45,540
- What are you laughing for?
- What?

1096
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:47,240
What are you laughing?

1097
01:08:48,647 --> 01:08:50,447
Now you're just being silly.

1098
01:08:53,347 --> 01:08:56,447
OK, stop hitting me, it's raining.
Let's find a shelter, come on.

1099
01:08:56,547 --> 01:08:57,647
I'm not going.

1100
01:08:57,747 --> 01:08:59,600
I'd like to take a walk in the rain...

1101
01:09:00,807 --> 01:09:03,607
...so when my face gets wet
I wouldn't be able to tell...

1102

Ying, don't you need to use the bathroom?

You want me to be with her?

01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:19,833

Ling.

1156
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:38,240
If you really wanna help,
you need to up your game.

1157
01:12:38,547 --> 01:12:40,173
In fact, I've checked.

1158
01:12:41,533 --> 01:12:44,327
- We'd be perfect for each other.
- Checked what?

1159
01:12:44,733 --> 01:12:45,840
Like names.

1160
01:12:46,013 --> 01:12:47,073
You see...

1161
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:50,187
...her name is Huanying
and mine is Guanglin.

1162
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:53,613
Together it means
"a warm welcome."

1163
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:55,747
Sounds good, huh?

1164
01:13:09,253 --> 01:13:12,300
You should talk to her more
while on the boat.

1165
01:13:12,473 --> 01:13:13,480
Relax.

1166
01:13:15,233 --> 01:13:16,533
How romantic is this?

1167
01:13:17,013 --> 01:13:19,887
I got it ready the day before yesterday,
was going to give it to her.

1168
01:13:20,193 --> 01:13:21,653
Won't it go bad in three days?

1169
01:13:23,147 --> 01:13:25,873
Nonsense.
I would never give Ying bad food.

1170
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:28,167
- Please don't give her this.
- I'll eat it instead.

1171
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:31,560
Yum.

1172
01:13:32,067 --> 01:13:33,073
Ling...

1173
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,027
...boats are ready.

1174
01:13:36,153 --> 01:13:38,653
Do we have to take the same boat?

1175
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,680
Sure, I'll get in the boat with you.

1176
01:13:40,787 --> 01:13:41,967
Ying.

1177
01:13:42,073 --> 01:13:43,927
Leng Te wants to sail with me.

1178
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,607
He... wants to talk to me about something.

1179
01:13:50,853 --> 01:13:52,000
You and Ling.

1180
01:13:53,327 --> 01:13:54,433
You two...

1181
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:05,247
You and Ling's cousin.

1182
01:14:14,847 --> 01:14:16,073
Family.

1183
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:18,027
In-laws.

1184
01:14:36,007 --> 01:14:37,007
Ling.

1185
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:41,407
I don't even know when you were born.

1186
01:14:42,007 --> 01:14:43,107
1982.

1187
01:14:45,207 --> 01:14:46,307
Next year?

1188
01:14:47,907 --> 01:14:49,107
Not that.

1189
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:54,973
I mean, I was planning on
having a baby next year.

1190
01:14:58,213 --> 01:14:59,333
Row faster.

1191
01:15:10,847 --> 01:15:12,100
Want some?

1192
01:15:20,327 --> 01:15:21,560
This is so good.

1193
01:15:26,967 --> 01:15:28,167
Why are you staring at me?

1194
01:15:28,267 --> 01:15:30,760
Well, we're the only ones here.
Who else am I going to look at?

1195
01:15:40,807 --> 01:15:41,907
Ying...

1196
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:44,247
Wanna switch?

1197
01:15:44,453 --> 01:15:45,553
Sure.

1198
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:48,887
Are you alright?

1199
01:15:49,031 --> 01:15:50,036
I'm OK.

1200
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,860
Just my appendicitis.

1201
01:15:53,967 --> 01:15:55,213
It's your turn to row.

1202
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:56,567
Why did you stop?

1203
01:15:57,547 --> 01:15:59,320
Who are you talking to in that tone?

1204
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:08,433
If you're not feeling well,
you can cough out loud.

1205
01:16:08,633 --> 01:16:09,833
I won't mind.

1206
01:16:10,433 --> 01:16:12,387
It's not that I don't want to cough.

1207
01:16:12,793 --> 01:16:14,193
I dare not.

1208
01:16:14,893 --> 01:16:16,493
Fast as you can.

1209
01:16:16,793 --> 01:16:17,893
You can do it.

1210
01:16:21,067 --> 01:16:22,167
Why bother?

1211
01:16:25,613 --> 01:16:27,813
Boss is not on the boat.
What did you call me?

1212
01:16:27,913 --> 01:16:29,513
Third brother.

1213
01:16:29,613 --> 01:16:31,013
What am I, a dwarf?

1214
01:17:02,133 --> 01:17:03,733
How far is the shore?

1215
01:17:04,433 --> 01:17:05,433
Close.

1216
01:17:05,833 --> 01:17:06,833
Go faster.

1217
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:09,333
I will try.

1218
01:17:11,033 --> 01:17:12,033
Faster.

1219
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:35,033
Who is that?

1220
01:17:35,133 --> 01:17:36,933
They fell into the water.

1221
01:17:37,033 --> 01:17:38,133
People are drowning.

1222
01:17:39,333 --> 01:17:40,733

01:18:16,947 --> 01:18:18,153
With some passion.

1227
01:18:18,253 --> 01:18:21,660
Since we've decided to sing in mandarin,
accent matters.

1228
01:18:22,347 --> 01:18:25,573
The thing is,
we have no idea if your mandarin...

1229
01:18:26,373 --> 01:18:27,680
...is standard or not.

1230
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,280
I'm the only radio announcer
in the factory.

1231
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,107
What do you think?

1232
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:39,240
I thought your dad
got you that job.

1233
01:18:40,873 --> 01:18:43,180
You are such a cynical person.

1234
01:18:44,993 --> 01:18:48,100
What evidence do you have
that my dad got me that job?

1235
01:18:49,967 --> 01:18:51,547
Please, it's so obvious.

1236
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,613
Before you were the announcer we didn't
even have a radio station in the factory.

1237
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:57,693
Let me tell you something.

1238
01:18:57,793 --> 01:19:01,767
That radio station was going to be built
with or without me.

1239
01:19:02,573 --> 01:19:06,801
Anyone can doubt my mandarin
but not you.

1240
01:19:12,667 --> 01:19:16,053
Once again, for the record,
me being the announcer...

1241
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,800
...has nothing to do with my dad,
the manager.

1242
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:22,212
It was simply because of
this beautiful voice...

1243
01:19:22,312 --> 01:19:24,913
...that I'm the only announcer
in the factory.

1244
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:26,373
I agree.

1245
01:19:26,747 --> 01:19:29,647
Guanglin does have the best
and the most radio-worthy...

1246
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:31,420
...voice among us all.

1247
01:19:31,727 --> 01:19:34,047
You're the best candidate
for the announcer job.

1248
01:19:38,067 --> 01:19:39,073
Shen Guanglin.

1249
01:19:42,093 --> 01:19:44,573
Ling, to be honest...

1250
01:19:45,787 --> 01:19:47,987
...with your help, these last few days.

1251
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:50,380
I think it's over between Ying and me.

1252
01:19:50,787 --> 01:19:52,387
Don't be so negative.

1253
01:19:52,893 --> 01:19:55,887
For what is worth,
you at least had a nice bath...

1254
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,260
...in the river.

1255
01:19:58,087 --> 01:20:00,287
Enough with the bath.

1256
01:20:01,107 --> 01:20:04,440
I think perhaps Ying heard some rumors...

1257
01:20:04,553 --> 01:20:07,160
...that my father did everything for me.

1258
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:09,853
That I'm just another spoiled rich kid.

1259
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:12,353
All the more reason not to give up now.

1260
01:20:12,477 --> 01:20:16,467
You should try harder, proving to
them you're not what they think you are.

1261
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,673
This show is the perfect opportunity...

1262
01:20:20,933 --> 01:20:24,313
...for me to show Ying
and everyone in the factory...

1263
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:27,967
...that I, Shen Guanglin,
am a man in my own right.

1264
01:20:28,547 --> 01:20:30,700
I'll be the star of the show.

1265
01:20:30,907 --> 01:20:33,013
I'm totally on board with you.

1266
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,767
What are you going to perform this time?

1267
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,007
A chorus.

1268
01:20:36,113 --> 01:20:39,553
How are you gonna be the star
of the show in a chorus?

1269
01:20:39,653 --> 01:20:42,780
If we sing well then
we'll be the star of the show.

1270
01:20:43,487 --> 01:20:45,787
You know what type of man Ying likes?

1271
01:20:50,713 --> 01:20:52,493
Tell me, otherwise how would I know?

1272
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:56,033
There's just one thing missing for you
to be her type.

1273
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:57,520
Not funny enough.

1274
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,520
Ying likes guys with a sense of humor.

1275
01:20:59,744 --> 01:21:01,653
Someone who makes her laugh.

1276
01:21:01,887 --> 01:21:03,773
So you must do something else on the show.

1277
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,147
I'll help.

1278
01:21:06,627 --> 01:21:08,647
I'm not sure if there's
enough time for that.

1279
01:21:08,773 --> 01:21:10,773
Director needs to approve the change.

1280
01:21:10,873 --> 01:21:13,136
- He's getting off work.
- Go talk to him then.

1281
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,387
Just get on the bike, will you?

1282
01:21:17,493 --> 01:21:19,293
I don't know how.

1283
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:34,393
- Ying, come on.
- Ling.

1284
01:21:34,493 --> 01:21:36,293
Why did you bring me here?

1285
01:21:36,393 --> 01:21:39,793
The talent show has begun.
To see Shen Guanglin's performance.

1286
01:21:39,917 --> 01:21:42,193
Why would I want to see that?

1287
01:21:42,993 --> 01:21:44,993
He'll definitely crack you up this time.

1288
01:21:45,093 --> 01:21:46,307
Let's go see him.

1289
01:21:46,731 --> 01:21:47,736
Ling.

1290
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:50,100
I sensed something's off
about you last time.

1291
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,860
What are you up to?

1292
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,033
I...

1293
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,907
Not that. Actually, I came up with the idea
for his skit. So, I'd like you to see it.

1294
01:21:58,007 --> 01:21:59,140
You came up with it?

1295
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:01,047
- Why didn't you say so?
- Let's go.

1296
01:22:01,147 --> 01:22:04,033
♪ For Eternity the Great Wall will stand ♪

1297
01:22:04,153 --> 01:22:08,353
♪ Through a thousand years
the Yellow River has run ♪

1298
01:22:08,477 --> 01:22:12,480
♪ All this spectacles and magnificence ♪

1299
01:22:12,787 --> 01:22:16,587
♪ Surely this can't be a land in decay ♪

1300
01:22:20,287 --> 01:22:21,975
I'm suddenly nervous.

1301
01:22:22,099 --> 01:22:23,187
It's OK.

1302
01:22:23,287 --> 01:22:24,299
Relax.

1303
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:26,187
Just do it as we rehearsed.

1304
01:22:26,287 --> 01:22:29,700
<i>The next performance
is absolutely a wonder.</i>

1305
01:22:29,807 --> 01:22:33,473
<i>Presented to you in an unprecedented form.</i>

1306
01:22:37,013 --> 01:22:40,580
<i>I can almost hear
the excitement in the air.</i>

1307
01:22:40,687 --> 01:22:42,887
<i>Without further ado, please enjoy...</i>

1308
01:22:42,987 --> 01:22:45,213
<i>...the following two-role act.</i>

1309
01:22:45,313 --> 01:22:47,873
<i>There is... The Duet.</i>

1310
01:22:50,153 --> 01:22:53,067
With this look, people will pee their
pants laughing upon your entrance.

1311
01:22:53,191 --> 01:22:54,349
Trust me.

1312
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:26,547
One more lap.

1313
01:23:28,713 --> 01:23:29,720
<i>No one's clapping.</i>

1314
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:31,567
<i>One more lap.</i>

1315
01:23:50,427 --> 01:23:54,627
<i>By this time, the audience
will be fighting for breath.</i>

1316
01:23:54,727 --> 01:23:56,151
You sure they will?

1317
01:23:56,251 --> 01:23:57,651
Most definitely.

1318
01:23:57,751 --> 01:24:02,227
With the look and that walk of yours,
they won't be able to stop laughing.

1319
01:24:02,327 --> 01:24:03,651
We still need a plan B, though.

1320
01:24:03,751 --> 01:24:06,027
<i>My dad will be sitting in the audience.</i>

1321
01:24:06,927 --> 01:24:08,327
How about this?

1322
01:24:08,451 --> 01:24:10,927
You can also try to put
your left foot on your right foot...

1323
01:24:11,027 --> 01:24:12,527
...and then just do this.

1324
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,287
<i>No one's clapping.</i>

1325
01:24:34,693 --> 01:24:36,287
<i>One more lap.</i>

1326
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:51,640
Sir, should I go up there and help him up?

1327
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:53,067
Let him get up on his own.

1328
01:24:54,787 --> 01:24:56,636
- Are you OK?
- I don't know why...

1329
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,727
It's just that...
his performance was so funny.

1330
01:25:00,527 --> 01:25:02,293
But I dared not to laugh.

1331
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,953
- It's OK, the show must go on.
- What?

1332
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:07,686
Out of my way,
I'm in character. Move.

1333
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,940
Let's show Guanglin some support, people.

1334
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,093
Sure!

1335
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:18,780
Shen Guanglin, get up!

1336
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:21,780
Shen Guanglin, get up!

1337
01:25:21,904 --> 01:25:23,680
Shen Guanglin, get up!

1338
01:25:23,804 --> 01:25:25,580
Shen Guanglin, get up!

1339
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:27,280
Shen Guanglin, get up!

1340
01:25:27,404 --> 01:25:29,680
Shen Guanglin, get up!

1341
01:25:29,804 --> 01:25:31,680
Shen Guanglin, get up!

1342
01:25:31,804 --> 01:25:33,780
Shen Guanglin, get up!

1343
01:25:33,904 --> 01:25:35,880
Shen Guanglin, get up!

1344
01:25:36,004 --> 01:25:38,080
Shen Guanglin, get up!

1345
01:25:38,204 --> 01:25:39,756
Shen Guanglin, get up!

1346
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,780
Shen Guanglin, get up!

1347
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:43,980
Shen Guanglin, get up!

1348
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:45,880
Shen Guanglin!

1349
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:47,304
Bravo, Shen Guanlin!

1350
01:25:47,404 --> 01:25:48,656
Shen Guanglin, good job!

1351
01:25:52,933 --> 01:25:56,560
Guanglin, let's try again
from before the fall.

1352
01:25:58,873 --> 01:25:59,880
Get away.

1353
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:13,933
<i>Something happened.</i>

1354
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:15,071
<i>No big deal.</i>

1355
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:16,373
<i>But it's okay.</i>

1356
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:19,013
<i>A duet is supposed to be
performed by two people.</i>

1357
01:26:19,213 --> 01:26:21,644
<i>Now please welcome
onto the stage my partner.</i>

1358
01:26:21,744 --> 01:26:22,903
<i>What do you say?</i>

1359
01:26:23,627 --> 01:26:24,627
<i>Please.</i>

1360
01:26:33,433 --> 01:26:36,273
Yumei, what are you doing?
Why aren't you going out there?

1361
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:41,129
Ling. I didn't know
it's going to be so awkward.

1362
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:42,494
Do I have to go?

1363
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,887
What about the rest of the performance?
It'll be humiliating ending like this.

1364
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:49,547
Even more humiliating than now?

1365
01:26:51,067 --> 01:26:52,573
<i>Perhaps I wasn't loud enough.</i>

1366
01:26:53,793 --> 01:26:56,827
<i>Please welcome onto the stage...
my partner!</i>

1367
01:26:57,073 --> 01:26:59,473
Maybe just the one person
being humiliated is enough.

1368
01:26:59,573 --> 01:27:01,007
I think I'll just sit this one out.

1369
01:27:12,547 --> 01:27:13,767
<i>I'll go take a look.</i>

1370
01:27:13,873 --> 01:27:15,849
- I'm here, partner.
- Yeah.

1371
01:27:15,973 --> 01:27:18,055
- Here I am.
- I guess I better leave then.

1372
01:27:18,179 --> 01:27:19,773
Where are you going? What about Ying?

1373
01:27:19,873 --> 01:27:21,697
My dad's gonna disown me
if I don't leave now.

1374
01:27:21,797 --> 01:27:23,567
- Don't go.
- You don't think I'm ashamed.

1375
01:27:23,667 --> 01:27:25,267
Not after you finish the performance.

1376
01:27:34,427 --> 01:27:35,627
Red underpants.

1377
01:27:38,927 --> 01:27:40,727
- I'm sorry.
- Don't touch me.

1378
01:27:41,527 --> 01:27:42,527
So...

1379
01:27:49,327 --> 01:27:50,627
You alright?

1380
01:27:50,827 --> 01:27:52,427
How is my dad doing?

1381
01:27:55,427 --> 01:27:56,427
Relax.

1382
01:27:57,127 --> 01:27:58,327
You dad left.

1383
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:02,727
Let's carry on.

1384
01:28:02,927 --> 01:28:04,527
Carry on my ass.

1385
01:28:05,427 --> 01:28:06,427
Come on.

1386
01:28:06,551 --> 01:28:07,839
Pull yourself together.

1387
01:28:07,939 --> 01:28:10,827
- Where do you think you're going?
- Don't go, stop.

1388
01:28:23,027 --> 01:28:24,427
Why are you back now?

1389
01:28:25,227 --> 01:28:27,727
Ying laughed. I have to pick a side.

1390
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,487
Music.

1391
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:15,760
<i>Are you happy to see me?</i>

1392
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:17,184
<i>Of course I am.</i>

1393
01:29:17,284 --> 01:29:18,748
<i>I can make you even happier.</i>

1394
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:24,160
<i>Rain will come, and mom will be mom.</i>

1395
01:29:24,260 --> 01:29:26,260
<i>You can't change that which is natural.</i>

1396
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:42,860
Then I just rushed onto the stage.

1397
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:45,852
Yumei wouldn't go whatsoever.

1398
01:29:45,952 --> 01:29:48,508
- She wouldn't?
- Bad call.

1399
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:52,760
How was I?

1400
01:29:53,787 --> 01:29:54,793
Extraordinary.

1401
01:29:58,933 --> 01:30:00,447
And how was Shen Guanglin?

1402
01:30:01,747 --> 01:30:04,067
You know what? He did surprise me tonight.

1403
01:30:05,887 --> 01:30:07,193
You don't say.

1404
01:30:10,053 --> 01:30:11,060
Ling.

1405
01:30:11,567 --> 01:30:14,447
You and Leng Te, you two...

1406
01:30:15,447 --> 01:30:17,653
Nothing will ever happen between us.

1407
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,507
I figured.

1408
01:30:19,913 --> 01:30:21,167
You're a catch.

1409
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:23,460
You can do so much better.

1410
01:30:28,973 --> 01:30:30,393
My mom used to say that.

1411
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:31,503
See.

1412
01:30:35,933 --> 01:30:36,940
Ying...

1413
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:41,220
...you will marry a great guy, too.

1414
01:30:42,813 --> 01:30:44,447
How could you know?

1415
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:46,933
I know physiognomy.

1416
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,504
As in face reading?

1417
01:30:48,604 --> 01:30:49,687
Try it on me.

1418
01:30:49,787 --> 01:30:50,867
Let me see.

1419
01:30:52,553 --> 01:30:53,947
First of all...

1420
01:30:54,053 --> 01:30:57,507
...your future husband
will be young, handsome...

1421
01:30:57,607 --> 01:30:59,473
...and powerful.

1422
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:03,567
Please, how can a man have
all these qualities at the same time?

1423
01:31:03,753 --> 01:31:04,847
He inherited it.

1424
01:31:14,887 --> 01:31:18,180
Right, do you prefer a son or a daughter?

1425
01:31:20,233 --> 01:31:21,700
A daughter would be great.

1426
01:31:22,507 --> 01:31:23,920
What are the odds?

1427
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:25,711
You will have a daughter.

1428
01:31:25,811 --> 01:31:27,393
- Do I?
- You don't say.

1429
01:31:27,553 --> 01:31:29,167
You daughter will have...

1430
01:31:29,713 --> 01:31:30,913
...big eyes...

1431
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:33,640
...and a slim face,
like a Barbie doll.

1432
01:31:33,764 --> 01:31:34,793
So pretty?

1433
01:31:34,893 --> 01:31:37,307
Looks aren't even her best traits.

1434
01:31:37,873 --> 01:31:40,367
She'll start school
at the age of five...

1435
01:31:40,491 --> 01:31:44,340
...and if her grades were ever the first in
her class it'd be considered a setback...

1436
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:47,233
...for she has always been
the first in her school.

1437
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:51,347
At 18, she'll get into this...

1438
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,787
...prestigious college...

1439
01:31:54,093 --> 01:31:59,953
...called UC something A,
where she studies film directing.

1440
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:03,553
And she makes 80 thousand a month.

1441
01:32:04,147 --> 01:32:06,869
How awesome is that?
Eighty thousand.

1442
01:32:10,380 --> 01:32:12,667
Ling, I can't say I agree with your values.

1443
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:17,540
I want nothing from my daughter,
except for her to be healthy and happy.

1444
01:32:22,667 --> 01:32:24,200
You don't get it.

1445
01:32:24,473 --> 01:32:26,173
How do I not get it?

1446
01:32:26,973 --> 01:32:28,747
Take me for instance.

1447
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:32,840
I'm like a little piglet,
healthy and happy.

1448
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:34,940
But completely useless.

1449
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:38,087
What the hell are you talking about?

1450
01:32:38,293 --> 01:32:39,940
I think you're great.

1451
01:32:44,207 --> 01:32:46,307
Well, you're not my mother.

1452
01:32:47,113 --> 01:32:49,413
I'd have no problem with that.

1453
01:32:51,313 --> 01:32:53,273
I'll tell you what, in our next life.

1454
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:55,980
We must be mother and daughter
in our next life.

1455
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:57,480
Deal?

1456
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:00,987
Come on.

1457
01:33:01,307 --> 01:33:02,353
Come on.

1458
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:05,348
But, next life...

1459
01:33:08,047 --> 01:33:09,767
I'll be your mom...

1460
01:33:15,067 --> 01:33:17,267
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

1461
01:33:19,667 --> 01:33:22,220
How about the life after next life?
You'll be my mother then.

1462
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:40,773
You're up.

1463
01:33:41,353 --> 01:33:42,460
Just a minute.

1464
01:33:44,487 --> 01:33:46,007
Why are you sewing it up?

1465
01:33:46,233 --> 01:33:48,127
It's an original style.

1466
01:33:48,587 --> 01:33:51,707
What style?
Looks like a cat made it with its claws.

1467
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:56,420
That's how it's supposed to look like.
These pants make you look young.

1468
01:33:56,813 --> 01:33:59,307
Why don't you just put on
crotchless pants then?

1469
01:34:00,433 --> 01:34:01,540
Much better.

1470
01:34:02,747 --> 01:34:04,807
Did I get drunk last night?

1471
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:08,513
You were pretty hammered,
puking all over.

1472
01:34:10,507 --> 01:34:12,013
You didn't puke, did you?

1473
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,787
Not at first.

1474
01:34:13,887 --> 01:34:15,893
I did when cleaning up your vomit.

1475
01:34:28,773 --> 01:34:29,927
- So, Ying...
- Ling.

1476
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:32,900
You go first.

1477
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:34,100
Alright.

1478
01:34:40,133 --> 01:34:41,240
I got married.

1479
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,020
Here's the certificate.

1480
01:34:48,673 --> 01:34:52,013
As a matter of fact, Wentian and I
have been together for three years.

1481
01:34:52,787 --> 01:34:54,160
We just never told anyone.

1482
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:57,393
Yesterday, while drinking,
I had an epiphany.

1483
01:34:57,620 --> 01:35:00,260
I think I should seize the opportunity...

1484
01:35:00,373 --> 01:35:02,640
...so I just stepped up and did it.

1485
01:35:02,813 --> 01:35:06,633
But it was a wrong step, you know that?
You're getting back to where you started.

1486
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:09,273
What do you mean by that?

1487
01:35:10,033 --> 01:35:13,007
Anyway, how do you know I didn't start
at the right place?

1488
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:16,153
I just know.

1489
01:35:16,507 --> 01:35:18,507
You know what?
While it's not too late...

1490
01:35:18,607 --> 01:35:20,307
...go get a divorce now.

1491
01:35:20,607 --> 01:35:21,631
I'm not going.

1492
01:35:21,731 --> 01:35:22,807
Go get a divorce.

1493
01:35:22,907 --> 01:35:24,907
What are you doing?

1494
01:35:25,007 --> 01:35:27,295
- I'll do it for you then.
- Give me that.

1495
01:35:27,619 --> 01:35:29,307
- Give it to me.
- What are you doing?

1496
01:35:29,431 --> 01:35:30,783
- Give me that.
- Cut it out.

1497
01:35:44,507 --> 01:35:46,795
I think I have a pretty good life.

1498
01:35:48,607 --> 01:35:50,307
Why don't you believe me?

1499
01:37:34,133 --> 01:37:36,347
How come I've never see you before?

1500
01:37:37,193 --> 01:37:40,660
I'm in a different office.
We don't see each other often.

1501
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:42,487
Which office is that?

1502
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,807
The boiler office.

1503
01:37:45,127 --> 01:37:46,533
So, you're a coal-shoveler?

1504
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:48,067
Don't say it like that.

1505
01:37:48,333 --> 01:37:51,407
It's a decent job
that keeps people warm.

1506
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:55,280
You do have some tricks.

1507
01:37:56,087 --> 01:37:58,040
Sister, your name is Xiaoling?

1508
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:00,867
What a pretty name.

1509
01:38:02,613 --> 01:38:05,233
If we ever have a daughter...

1510
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:06,920
...we'll name her that.

1511
01:38:09,233 --> 01:38:11,333
Do you prefer a son or a daughter?

1512
01:38:11,527 --> 01:38:12,533
A son.

1513
01:38:13,240 --> 01:38:14,693
That's sexism.

1514
01:38:14,930 --> 01:38:15,960
No.

1515
01:38:16,087 --> 01:38:17,193
Think about it.

1516
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:20,427
If we have a son that takes after her
he'd be a handsome boy.

1517
01:38:20,553 --> 01:38:23,967
But if our daughter takes after me
it'd be a tragedy.

1518
01:38:33,307 --> 01:38:37,413
Maybe she can have my face
but it's gotta be her body.

1519
01:38:37,537 --> 01:38:39,262
Slender and tall.

1520
01:38:39,386 --> 01:38:41,833
She should at least
inherit one good set of genes.

1521
01:38:42,933 --> 01:38:44,747
What if she inherits neither?

1522
01:38:46,427 --> 01:38:47,527
It's OK.

1523
01:38:47,793 --> 01:38:49,420
She can be all you.

1524
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,613
As long as our daughter
is healthy and happy.

1525
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:55,127
Right?

1526
01:38:55,373 --> 01:38:56,920
Couldn't agree more.

1527
01:38:57,327 --> 01:39:00,727
Cousin, you and I
may not agree on everything...

1528
01:39:01,333 --> 01:39:03,413
...but ever since we met...

1529
01:39:03,773 --> 01:39:06,307
...I felt this strange closeness
between us.

1530
01:39:08,493 --> 01:39:10,080
It's really unusual.

1531
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,244
Ying, let's go.

1532
01:39:12,344 --> 01:39:13,427
- Go.
- To where?

1533
01:39:13,527 --> 01:39:16,527
To tell everyone the good news.
It'll make them happy.

1534
01:39:16,651 --> 01:39:18,503
Sister, you stay. Go.

1535
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:51,740
It's time for me to go back.

1536
01:40:12,073 --> 01:40:13,180
Leng Te...

1537
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:18,487
...here.

1538
01:40:24,393 --> 01:40:27,420
I asked you out today
to say goodbye.

1539
01:40:29,327 --> 01:40:30,333
I'm leaving.

1540
01:40:31,333 --> 01:40:32,847
You're leaving?

1541
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:35,947
I have no more business here.

1542
01:40:37,507 --> 01:40:40,160
So, did you tell Ying?

1543
01:40:40,873 --> 01:40:42,507
Don't worry about that.

1544
01:40:43,047 --> 01:40:45,113
I will see her again soon enough.

1545
01:40:46,667 --> 01:40:48,373
Can't say the same about you, though.

1546
01:40:49,887 --> 01:40:50,920
Ling.

1547
01:40:52,127 --> 01:40:53,127
Stop the car.

1548
01:40:54,827 --> 01:40:56,660
Where are you going?

1549
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:00,053
Shenzhen.

1550
01:41:00,927 --> 01:41:03,640
Ying and Wentian have been going out
for three years.

1551
01:41:03,747 --> 01:41:05,487
The whole factory was talking about it.

1552
01:41:05,593 --> 01:41:07,740
Also that I've been pursuing Ying
for a week.

1553
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:09,787
The whole factory
was talking about that, too.

1554
01:41:09,887 --> 01:41:11,039
I'm sorry.

1555
01:41:11,139 --> 01:41:12,267
No need.

1556
01:41:12,373 --> 01:41:14,527
It's a perfect albeit awkward chance...

1557
01:41:14,933 --> 01:41:17,467
...for me to steer away
from my father's shadow.

1558
01:41:17,567 --> 01:41:19,127
I'm gonna be my own boss.

1559
01:41:19,227 --> 01:41:20,740
You're so brave.

1560
01:41:21,307 --> 01:41:23,180
What are you gonna do in Shenzhen?

1561
01:41:23,287 --> 01:41:24,607
Haven't figured that out yet.

1562
01:41:24,707 --> 01:41:26,907
The factory set up a new office
in Shenzhen...

1563
01:41:27,007 --> 01:41:30,087
...and my dad asked me to run it,
wanting me to gain some experience.

1564
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,253
I said no.

1565
01:41:35,313 --> 01:41:37,767
I'll get a job myself
and live my life.

1566
01:41:38,427 --> 01:41:41,887
I yielded the position
to a female co-worker.

1567
01:41:43,127 --> 01:41:44,673
I think her name is Wang Qin.

1568
01:41:48,387 --> 01:41:49,893
Let's all work for a better future.

1569
01:41:50,293 --> 01:41:53,027
No need to shake hands.
We've both been unlucky.

1570
01:41:55,447 --> 01:41:57,747
Come find me in Shenzhen
if thing's don't go so well.

1571
01:41:58,047 --> 01:41:59,880
Are you leaving or not?

1572
01:41:59,987 --> 01:42:01,027
Coming.

1573
01:42:02,513 --> 01:42:03,673
So this is it.

1574
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:08,647
Have a safe trip.

1575
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:12,393
Put your mind at ease,
I'll make it safe come what may.

1576
01:42:12,553 --> 01:42:13,653
So this is it.

1577
01:42:22,347 --> 01:42:23,420
Ling...

1578
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:26,880
What are you doing here?

1579
01:42:27,347 --> 01:42:28,353
You're leaving?

1580
01:42:29,387 --> 01:42:30,387
Take this with you.

1581
01:42:30,587 --> 01:42:31,793
For the road.

1582
01:42:33,013 --> 01:42:34,387
I don't need them.

1583
01:42:34,993 --> 01:42:37,833
Zhang Jiang, I'll tell you the truth
now that you're here.

1584
01:42:38,867 --> 01:42:40,880
Remember the first time you saw me?

1585
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:44,060
Sure. It's like, "bang,"
and you crashed into the ground.

1586
01:42:46,007 --> 01:42:47,653
I'm going away now.

1587
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:50,080
Probably in the same way, with a "bang."

1588
01:42:50,413 --> 01:42:52,613
Or, possibly, just a "whoosh."

1589
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:55,040
Could there be smoke?

1590
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:57,440
It really could.

1591
01:42:57,540 --> 01:42:58,627
Uncles...

1592
01:42:59,633 --> 01:43:01,233
...see you soon!

1593
01:43:24,947 --> 01:43:26,160
Girl...

1594
01:43:26,787 --> 01:43:28,340
...don't get heatstroke.

1595
01:43:31,533 --> 01:43:32,940
What's taking so long?

1596
01:43:33,467 --> 01:43:35,253
Take a rest and eat something.

1597
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:44,593
By what means are you gonna leave?

1598
01:43:44,693 --> 01:43:46,567
You can't stop talking, can you?

1599
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:52,527
Ling...

1600
01:43:52,760 --> 01:43:55,400
...that's some funny tailor work
on your pants.

1601
01:43:55,507 --> 01:43:56,513
Ying did it.

1602
01:43:57,313 --> 01:43:59,213
Well, she's got some skills.

1603
01:43:59,513 --> 01:44:00,980
Not like my mom.

1604
01:44:01,080 --> 01:44:04,740
You should see the size of the patch
she put on my pants.

1605
01:44:09,467 --> 01:44:13,000
My mom used to have clumsy hands, too,
always patching up my pants.

1606
01:44:13,607 --> 01:44:17,127
My classmates made fun of me
so she secretly practiced at home.

1607
01:44:17,387 --> 01:44:20,833
In the end,
no matter how worn out my pants were...

1608
01:44:20,953 --> 01:44:23,553
...she could always fashion
a cute pattern on them.

1609
01:44:23,653 --> 01:44:24,660
Do I?

1610
01:44:25,607 --> 01:44:26,747
Like this.

1611
01:44:27,253 --> 01:44:28,300
Not bad.

1612
01:44:41,067 --> 01:44:43,353
But my mom can't do that yet.

1613
01:44:44,713 --> 01:44:47,220
<i>Mom, I finished first in the race.</i>

1614
01:44:52,933 --> 01:44:54,067
Ling, here.

1615
01:44:54,973 --> 01:44:56,333
<i>Just a minute.</i>

1616
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:01,140
What's wrong, Ling?

1617
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:02,440
Ling, what happened?

1618
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:09,466
But my mom can't do that yet.

1619
01:45:12,867 --> 01:45:13,867
Ling.

1620
01:45:17,467 --> 01:45:18,567
Xiaoling.

1621
01:45:36,387 --> 01:45:38,740
<i>You see, I'm a lousy daughter...</i>

1622
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,588
<i>...who has never even made you proud once.</i>

1623
01:45:44,601 --> 01:45:46,527
<i>How I wish I could change that.</i>

1624
01:45:48,133 --> 01:45:49,333
<i>The 1980s...</i>

1625
01:45:49,733 --> 01:45:52,321
<i>...is an era of passion...</i>

1626
01:45:52,945 --> 01:45:56,021
<i>...and a time of adventurous spirit.</i>

1627
01:45:56,645 --> 01:45:57,833
<i>Back then...</i>

1628
01:45:58,133 --> 01:45:59,733
<i>...being a factory worker...</i>

1629
01:45:59,833 --> 01:46:02,033
<i>...was the most honorable thing...</i>

1630
01:46:02,533 --> 01:46:06,321
<i>...with their standard-issue
blue uniform and bicycle.</i>

1631
01:46:08,133 --> 01:46:11,221
<i>For many, memories of the 80s...</i>

1632
01:46:11,345 --> 01:46:14,333
<i>...are well kept in old photos.</i>

1633
01:46:14,433 --> 01:46:17,545
<i>At that time,
color film wasn't even available...</i>

1634
01:46:17,645 --> 01:46:19,674
<i>...in China.</i>

1635
01:46:19,798 --> 01:46:20,833
<i>So...</i>

1636
01:46:20,933 --> 01:46:23,821
<i>...the videos and photos we can find...</i>

1637
01:46:23,945 --> 01:46:26,221
<i>...are mostly black and white.</i>

1638
01:46:26,833 --> 01:46:29,921
<i>However, skillful photographers...</i>

1639
01:46:30,145 --> 01:46:34,621
<i>...would use paint to add a touch
of color to those gray pictures.</i>

1640
01:46:36,633 --> 01:46:37,833
To the canteen?

1641
01:46:40,133 --> 01:46:43,433
Excuse me, coming through.

1642
01:46:58,533 --> 01:46:59,533
Li Huanying.

1643
01:47:02,533 --> 01:47:03,533
Li Huanying.

1644
01:47:23,993 --> 01:47:25,093
Zhang Jiang.

1645
01:47:27,273 --> 01:47:29,173
How come you look so young?

1646
01:47:29,873 --> 01:47:30,873
Do I?

1647
01:47:30,997 --> 01:47:33,573
Maybe it's this red armband I'm wearing.

1648
01:47:33,673 --> 01:47:35,973
I don't think that's what it is.

1649
01:47:36,173 --> 01:47:38,953
You are a young fella, aren't you?

1650
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:42,953
Well, you're not exactly ripe yourself.

1651
01:47:58,393 --> 01:48:00,181
I was rejuvenated.

1652
01:48:04,093 --> 01:48:06,893
How did this even happen?

1653
01:48:12,093 --> 01:48:13,143
My sweetie.

1654
01:48:14,093 --> 01:48:15,093
Ying.

1655
01:48:27,593 --> 01:48:30,693
- Let's go.
- Uncle Zhang, please, you always liked me.

1656
01:48:31,593 --> 01:48:33,105
Stay still, not quite done yet.

1657
01:48:33,205 --> 01:48:34,493
Hurry up, kid.

1658
01:48:34,893 --> 01:48:36,693
- All right.
- Don't move.

1659
01:48:37,693 --> 01:48:39,093
Are you happy to see me?

1660
01:48:39,193 --> 01:48:40,317
Of course I am.

1661
01:48:40,417 --> 01:48:42,081
I can make you even happier.

1662
01:48:43,793 --> 01:48:45,193
Let me help you.

1663
01:48:45,493 --> 01:48:48,305
TV, refrigerator, you name it.
I can get them all for you.

1664
01:48:48,405 --> 01:48:49,493
Trust me.

1665
01:48:50,493 --> 01:48:53,193
I think we should all remember that...

1666
01:48:53,293 --> 01:48:56,892
...Li Huanying is the first in our factory
to get a TV.

1667
01:48:58,193 --> 01:48:59,293
Your cousin?

1668
01:49:00,943 --> 01:49:01,993
Yes.

1669
01:49:02,093 --> 01:49:03,893
She's a cocky one.

1670
01:49:05,493 --> 01:49:07,193
What is she doing here?

1671
01:49:09,193 --> 01:49:10,692
Trying to make me happy.

1672
01:49:18,643 --> 01:49:19,793
What is this?

1673
01:49:20,317 --> 01:49:22,893
So, Xiaoling helped you
with all your chores...

1674
01:49:22,993 --> 01:49:24,893
...and now you're quitting on her?

1675
01:49:25,393 --> 01:49:26,417
Ying.

1676
01:49:26,517 --> 01:49:29,093
Why do we have to play this game?

1677
01:49:29,617 --> 01:49:32,081
Xiaoling's mom was a volleyball player...

1678
01:49:33,193 --> 01:49:35,493
...and now she's probably gone.

1679
01:49:36,293 --> 01:49:39,393
But, what does that have to do with us?

1680
01:49:42,193 --> 01:49:44,493
She said I look just like her mother.

1681
01:50:00,893 --> 01:50:02,193
Let's go home.

1682
01:50:03,293 --> 01:50:04,593
Mommy.

1683
01:50:07,293 --> 01:50:08,393
Yes.

1684
01:50:09,293 --> 01:50:11,493
I'll be your mom in the next life.

1685
01:50:15,793 --> 01:50:18,381
<i>No, I'll be your mom in the next life.</i>

1686
01:50:47,393 --> 01:50:49,953
<i>You managed to hold up the bun
when you fell.</i>

1687
01:50:57,953 --> 01:51:02,053
<i>Mom, I pooped my pants.</i>

1688
01:51:05,953 --> 01:51:07,347
<i>Stop laughing.</i>

1689
01:51:07,853 --> 01:51:09,360
<i>Bad mommy.</i>

1690
01:51:12,133 --> 01:51:15,127
<i>Why does my baby keep pooping her pants?</i>

1691
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:18,527
<i>Because you're so little.</i>

1692
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:22,600
<i>If you're so little, how come you're
in the same class with older kids?</i>

1693
01:51:22,927 --> 01:51:25,280
<i>That's because my baby is the smartest.</i>

1694
01:51:25,387 --> 01:51:26,397
<i>Aren't you?</i>

1695
01:51:26,497 --> 01:51:27,500
<i>Yes.</i>

1696
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:30,700
<i>Let mommy have a sniff.</i>

1697
01:51:31,612 --> 01:51:33,167
<i>Mommy.</i>

1698
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:37,133
<i>Li Huanying.</i>

1699
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:40,200
<i>What did you call me, you little brat?</i>

1700
01:51:40,307 --> 01:51:42,507
<i>I want to eat skewers.</i>

1701
01:51:46,573 --> 01:51:47,773
<i>Let's go.</i>

1702
01:51:48,473 --> 01:51:50,173
<i>Can we not eat skewers?</i>

1703
01:51:52,273 --> 01:51:53,273
<i>Alright.</i>

1704
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:56,724
<i>How about some crawfish?</i>

1705
01:51:56,824 --> 01:51:58,100
<i>Absolutely.</i>

1706
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:01,700
<i>My baby is so gullible.</i>

1707
01:52:03,593 --> 01:52:05,193
<i>Are those crawfish?</i>

1708
01:52:12,887 --> 01:52:14,487
<i>So many of them...</i>

1709
01:52:16,687 --> 01:52:18,187
<i>...biting your tummy.</i>

1710
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:29,050
<i>Mom...</i>

1711
01:52:29,150 --> 01:52:30,488
<i>Li Huanying.</i>

1712
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:33,900
<i>What did you call me, you little brat?</i>

1713
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,800
<i>I got into the provincial institute of art.</i>

1714
01:52:39,800 --> 01:52:41,424
<i>Come again, what?</i>

1715
01:52:41,524 --> 01:52:43,800
<i>I got into the provincial institute of art.</i>

1716
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,900
<i>Ying, I heard it.</i>

1717
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,100
<i>Xiaoling got into
the provincial institute of art.</i>

1718
01:52:51,613 --> 01:52:53,813
<i>Why is the tuition so expensive?</i>

1719
01:52:54,313 --> 01:52:57,001
<i>Mommy, there's like a thousand left
on this account.</i>

1720
01:52:57,125 --> 01:52:58,313
<i>Not this.</i>

1721
01:52:58,513 --> 01:53:02,113
<i>This is my backup plan in case
you turn out to be a total failure.</i>

1722
01:53:02,213 --> 01:53:04,913
<i>How dare you say that?
Don't you believe in me?</i>

1723
01:53:05,013 --> 01:53:06,113
<i>I do.</i>

1724
01:53:06,213 --> 01:53:08,413
<i>That's bullshit.</i>

1725
01:53:09,213 --> 01:53:10,237
<i>What if...</i>

1726
01:53:10,337 --> 01:53:12,213
<i>Don't "what if" me.</i>

1727
01:53:18,313 --> 01:53:20,313
<i>I forgot to give you this,
take it.</i>

1728
01:53:21,213 --> 01:53:22,437
<i>When did you make them?</i>

1729
01:53:22,537 --> 01:53:24,413
<i>Does it matter? You will eat it anyway.</i>

1730
01:53:25,213 --> 01:53:28,001
<i>Mom, it's snowing.
You should take the bus home.</i>

1731
01:53:28,225 --> 01:53:32,401
<i>- It's not that far, I can just walk.
- Come on, buy the ticket now.</i>

1732
01:53:32,525 --> 01:53:34,813
<i>Since when did you learn to
care about your mother?</i>

1733
01:53:35,913 --> 01:53:37,780
<i>I'll see you get on it.</i>

1734
01:53:49,087 --> 01:53:50,537
<i>Can I get a refund for the ticket?</i>

1735
01:53:50,637 --> 01:53:53,563
<i>- Aunt Ying, why are you getting off?
- I have some unfinished business.</i>

1736
01:55:32,367 --> 01:55:33,527
Mom.

1737
01:55:35,233 --> 01:55:36,240
Don't go.

1738
01:55:37,613 --> 01:55:39,607
Don't leave me.

1739
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:47,500
Don't go.

1740
01:56:00,633 --> 01:56:01,840
My baby...

1741
01:56:03,347 --> 01:56:06,420
...you'll live a healthy
and happy life.

1742
01:56:08,987 --> 01:56:11,040
I can't.
