00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:48,940
- I'm a failure.
- Oh, poppycock.

177
00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:50,675
I was reaching too high.

178
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:54,612
Honestly, one negative comment,
and it's all, "Woe is me."

179
00:09:54,646 --> 00:09:57,181
Nana, come on.
She said I'm not good enough.

180
00:09:57,215 --> 00:09:59,350
I mean, heck,
I've just been told

181
00:09:59,384 --> 00:10:01,386
that my destiny,
all of my hopes and dreams,

182
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:03,254
uh, they all end right here.

183
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:04,656
Well, what did you expect?

184
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:07,725
That she would drop to her knees
and declare you a genius?

185
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,262
Roll out the red carpet
for the great Buster Moon!

186
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:12,930
She-she ran me off the road
into a canal.

187
00:10:12,964 --> 00:10:14,632
Well, you're still
in one piece, aren't you?

188
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,267
Well, yeah, but...

189
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,270
Well, anyone who dares set out
to follow their dreams

190
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:22,874
is bound to face a lot worse
than a dip in the canal.

191
00:10:22,907 --> 00:10:24,542
Ah, Hobbs. I found him.

192
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:26,310
Uh, bring the car round,
will you?

193
00:10:26,344 --> 00:10:27,812
- There's a good chap.
- I-I...

194
00:10:27,845 --> 00:10:30,381
I just thought she'd at least
see we deserved a shot.

195
00:10:30,415 --> 00:10:33,217
Never mind what this person
you don't even know said.

196
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:35,353
Do you think you're good enough?

197
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:36,821
- Of course, but...
- Then you must fight

198
00:10:36,854 --> 00:10:37,955
for what you believe in.

199
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:40,224
Guts, stamina, faith.

200
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:42,226
These are the things
you need now,

201
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,395
and without them...

202
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:46,731
Well, maybe that scout
was right.

203
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:49,667

Moon. Hey.

228
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:28,666
Wow.
You were great out there.

229
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:30,535
I got to go back out
for an encore.

230
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:31,969
Okay.
Hey, but what are you doing

231
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:33,604
- after the show?
- Uh, nothing.

232
00:12:33,638 --> 00:12:35,406
Well, listen, I know this is
crazy short notice,

233
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:37,075
but you always said
you'd come back to work with us

234
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:39,077
- when the time was right.
- Of course.

235
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:41,579
Well, this is that time.

236
00:12:41,612 --> 00:12:43,081
Here, paycheck.

237
00:12:43,115 --> 00:12:44,682
I'm getting the gang together
to go audition

238
00:12:44,715 --> 00:12:46,384
- for this huge show...
- Just-just a second.

239
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,820
Hey, Rick, how come
you're only paying me

240
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:50,588
half what the other acts get?

241
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:52,890
I pay what I think
you're worth, sweetheart.

242
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:54,659
Oh, okay.
See, I have this rule

243
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:57,962
about not letting guys like you
tell me what I'm worth,

244
00:12:57,995 --> 00:12:59,764
so, you know, unless I get paid

245
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:01,766
like everyone else,
I'm out of here.

246
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,835
This is the only club in town.

247
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:05,103
Where else you gonna play?

248
00:13:05,137 --> 00:13:07,038
I have no idea,
but I'm sure as heck

249
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:08,573
not sticking around here.

250
00:13:08,606 --> 00:13:09,707
Let's go.

251
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,442
Ooh!

252
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:13,911
Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
You-you got to do the encore.

253
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:15,947
Hey, Ash!

254
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,982
Deal with it, sweetheart.

255
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:19,984
Redshore City Bus five

256
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:22,420
leaving from park 15...

257
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:24,755
Okay, I got the tickets.

258
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:25,990
Anyone seen Miss Crawly?

259
00:13:26,023 --> 00:13:27,391
Here you go, Johnny.

260
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:28,693
- Here's yours, and...
- Mr. Moon.

261
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:30,862
Uh, uh, I'm sorry,
but I'm really having

262
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:32,463
second thoughts about this.

263
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:34,632
What? No, no, no, wait.

264
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:36,500
All right, last call. Let's go.

265
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:38,502
- Now, just a second.
- Johnny's right.

266
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:40,172
I mean, that theater scout,

267
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:41,906
she didn't think
we were good enough.

268
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:44,142
- She sounds like a jerk.
- Yeah, total jerk.

269
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:46,410
Yeah, but she's wrong...
dead wrong.

270
00:13:46,444 --> 00:13:49,480
There's a reason our show
is sold out every night,

271
00:13:49,513 --> 00:13:51,449
and I'm telling you,
her boss is gonna love it.

272
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:53,151
Ooh. Or maybe
we could just, like,

273
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:55,019
do a different show, you know?

274
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:56,721
Gunter, please, I got this.

275
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:59,957
Seriously, I have this idea
for, like, a space musical.

276
00:13:59,991 --> 00:14:02,894
All right, we're rolling out here.

277
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:05,097
You don't want to hear
about the space musical?

278
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,732
Guys, come on!

279
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,567
Wait!

280
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:20,745
Listen, you guys,
I have dreamt of performing

281
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:23,714
in Redshore City
since I was a little kid.

282
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:25,683
And besides,
I just convinced my husband

283
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:27,718
to babysit
for the next 24 hours,

284
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:30,655
and I am not gonna waste
an opportunity like that.

285
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:33,958
So come on.
We've got nothing to lose.

286
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,229
Here, Ash.

287
00:14:37,262 --> 00:14:38,796
You come in on page two.

288
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:40,698
Wait. We're just gonna
rehearse this here

289
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:42,700
- at the back of the bus?
- Yes, we are.

290
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,236
- Course we are.
- Yep.

291
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:46,604
We got to get this show
in the best shape ever.

292
00:14:46,637 --> 00:14:48,806
Ah, Miss Crawly,
you made it. Good.

293
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,209
You are an angel, and we're
sure gonna need that...

294
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:53,044
Whoa!

295
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:54,545

I'm here to see Mr. Crystal
for the presentation.

321
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:56,667
This is so unfair.

322
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,236
She's, like, totally unfair,
that lady.

323
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,805
I mean, why's she
got to be so snotty about it?

324
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:02,873
I got all dressed up
for nothing.

325

Thank you very much.

413
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:05,410
Jerry, for the love of...

414
00:22:05,443 --> 00:22:07,112
- Sorry, sir.
- Well, where's the next group, Jerry?

415
00:22:07,145 --> 00:22:08,380
Why am I standing here waiting?

416
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:09,681

I just... I just, uh...

Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

419
00:22:13,016 --> 00:22:14,686
Um, okay. Um, you.

420
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:16,987
Hey. Hey. Yeah, you.

421
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,523
Little guy, you're here
for the audition?

422
00:22:18,556 --> 00:22:20,291
Uh, yes.

423
00:22:20,325 --> 00:22:22,060
Yeah, yeah, yes, we are.

424
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:24,027
Guys, we're on right now.

425
00:22:24,062 --> 00:22:25,296
- Now?
- What?

426
00:22:27,232 --> 00:22:29,367
Your name?
Hey, your name, please?

427
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:32,270
Uh, it's Buster Moon
from the New Moon Theater.

428
00:22:32,303 --> 00:22:34,706
And we're very excited to share
our story with you today, sir.

429
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:36,074
Right, guys?

430
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:38,276
Yeah, great. Now, get to it.

431
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:39,144
Of course. Yes.

432
00:22:39,177 --> 00:22:41,079
Okay, guys,
just like we rehearsed.

433
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:45,350
This is the story

434
00:22:45,383 --> 00:22:48,052
of an ordinary high school girl
who discovers...

435
00:22:48,086 --> 00:22:49,487
Stop.

436
00:22:49,521 --> 00:22:50,522
Stop?

437
00:22:50,555 --> 00:22:51,556
He wants you to stop.

438
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,292
"Ordinary" and "school."

439
00:22:54,325 --> 00:22:56,094
Two words I will never
be associated with.

440
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:58,096
- Never. Never.
- Where the heck did you

441
00:22:58,129 --> 00:22:59,330
dig these guys up from, huh?

442
00:22:59,364 --> 00:23:00,698
If you could all leave
very quickly,

443
00:23:00,732 --> 00:23:02,100
we'd appreciate that, please.

444
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:04,102
I need big shows, Jerry.

445
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:06,104
- Big ideas!
- Yes, sir, big. The biggest.

446
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:08,072
Hey, I have a big one.

447
00:23:09,006 --> 00:23:10,974
Okay, honey. Come on, let's go.

448
00:23:11,008 --> 00:23:12,677
You know, the sci-fi musical.

449
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:14,712
- That's big, right?
- Um, uh...

450
00:23:14,746 --> 00:23:17,115
I mean, it's got
the aliens and the robots

451
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:19,484
and the lasers
and these amazing songs

452
00:23:19,517 --> 00:23:21,219
from, like, Clay Calloway to...

453
00:23:21,252 --> 00:23:23,688
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Clay Calloway?

454
00:23:23,721 --> 00:23:25,557
I love Clay Calloway.

455
00:23:26,424 --> 00:23:27,625
I know, right?

456
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,060
I mean, doesn't everybody?

457
00:23:29,093 --> 00:23:30,462
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
See, Jerry?

458
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:33,198
This is exactly the kind
of big idea I'm talking about.

459
00:23:33,231 --> 00:23:34,766
- Yes, sir.
- So, uh...

460
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,568
so what's the show called?

461
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:38,770
What's it called? Um...

462
00:23:38,803 --> 00:23:41,072
- Gunter, you, uh...
- you want to...

463
00:23:41,105 --> 00:23:42,407
...uh, tell Mr. Crystal
what it's called?

464
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,477
Uh-huh. It's called

- Ah.

488
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,437
Okay, so what, you got

489
00:24:46,471 --> 00:24:48,339
some kind of personal connection

490
00:24:48,373 --> 00:24:50,675

- Moon!

Wait, if you know him,

492
00:24:52,343 --> 00:24:56,281

495
00:25:00,818 --> 00:25:02,420
Sir, I'm sorry, but seriously?

496
00:25:02,453 --> 00:25:04,856
You think this little guy
from nowhere

497
00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:07,592
can get Clay Calloway
in the show?

498
00:25:09,394 --> 00:25:11,462
Well, Suki,
for your information,

499
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:15,099
I am not just
a little guy from nowhere.

500
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:16,834
Consider it done, sir.

501
00:25:16,868 --> 00:25:18,570
I'll give you three weeks, Moon.

502
00:25:18,603 --> 00:25:21,239
Three weeks to get this show
up and running, okay?

503
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:22,840
Yes, sir. Thank you.

504
00:25:22,874 --> 00:25:24,576
Moon, do you really know
Clay Calloway?

505
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:25,710
Shh, shh. Not now.

506
00:25:25,743 --> 00:25:27,378
- Jerry.
- Oh! Right here, sir.

507
00:25:27,412 --> 00:25:29,614
I want these guys
to start work right away.

508
00:25:29,647 --> 00:25:32,317
Set 'em up with our designers,
our dancers, whatever they need.

509
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,385
And get 'em rooms
at the hotel, okay?

510
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:36,721
The very best suites.
The whole shaboodle.

511
00:25:36,754 --> 00:25:37,855
Yes, sir. Yes, of course.

512
00:25:37,889 --> 00:25:39,357
Uh, hey, one last thing.

513
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,492
Don't you ever do nothing
to make me look bad.

514
00:25:41,526 --> 00:25:42,860
You got that?

515
00:25:42,894 --> 00:25:44,495
Oh, I will never
let that happen, sir.

or I'll throw you off the roof.

00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,201
Great job, everyone.

518
00:25:50,234 --> 00:25:52,503
Take it away, Raoul.

519
00:25:57,508 --> 00:25:58,276
Oh, my gosh.

520
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:00,178
- Is this really happening?
- Yeah!

521
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:02,513
We're playing
Redshore City, baby!

522
00:26:02,547 --> 00:26:05,283
Yes, we are, Gunter.

You're a genius.

525
00:26:08,653 --> 00:26:10,521
Yeah, well, Mama always said,

526
00:26:10,555 --> 00:26:13,725
"Gunter, you're not as stupid
as your papa."

527
00:26:13,758 --> 00:26:15,493
No, you're not.

528
00:26:15,526 --> 00:26:16,861
Hey, Suki.

529
00:26:16,894 --> 00:26:18,329
No hard feelings, huh?

530
00:26:18,363 --> 00:26:20,665
You have no idea
what you're getting into.

531
00:26:20,698 --> 00:26:21,899
Whoa.

532
00:26:21,933 --> 00:26:23,401
- Are you out of your mind?
- What?

533
00:26:23,434 --> 00:26:25,570
Clay Calloway?
I'm, like, his biggest fan,

534
00:26:25,603 --> 00:26:27,805
and I can tell you,
the guy is a recluse.

535
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:29,907
Seriously, after his wife died,

536
00:26:29,941 --> 00:26:31,909
no one's seen him
in over 15 years.

537
00:26:31,943 --> 00:26:33,878
Ah. That's not good.

538
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:35,613
No, it's not.

539
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:37,515
Uh...

540
00:26:37,548 --> 00:26:39,851
Miss Crawly, I need you
to help me find Clay Calloway.

541
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:41,653
An address,
a phone number, anything.

542
00:26:41,686 --> 00:26:43,921

and it's, like, cuckoo crazy,

566
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:52,457
and then I think
we should have, like,

567
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,293
this cool alien tango scene.

568
00:27:55,326 --> 00:27:59,530

569
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:00,898
Oh. I love it.

570
00:28:00,932 --> 00:28:02,734
Wait. I've got a better idea.

571
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:06,838
What if it was, like,
a big underwater scene instead?

572
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:08,372
- Underwater?
- Yeah, yeah.

573
00:28:08,406 --> 00:28:10,274
I'm sure of this. Write it down.

574
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:11,676
- Mm, okay.
- Wait, wait.

575
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:13,945
Stop your clicky-clacky.
I have a better idea.

576
00:28:13,978 --> 00:28:15,847
Uh, you can't keep
changing your mind.

577
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,048
Why?

578
00:28:17,082 --> 00:28:18,883
Why? Because in
exactly 20 minutes,

579
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:22,019
the stage crew are coming here
to start work on our show,

580
00:28:22,054 --> 00:28:24,056
and we need to lock
this stuff down.

581
00:28:24,089 --> 00:28:26,891
Oh, my gosh, they're early.

582
00:28:26,924 --> 00:28:29,460
Ooh, and I want to have, like,
this beautiful love scene...

583
00:28:29,494 --> 00:28:31,496
Miss Crawly,
anything on Calloway?

584
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:33,798
- Hmm, not a thing.
- Oh, geez.

585
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:37,802
Ah, Mr. Moon.

586
00:28:37,835 --> 00:28:39,904
We're your production team,
and we're here to start...

587
00:28:39,937 --> 00:28:42,740
Yes, yes, yes. Uh, you're here
to work on the show.

588
00:28:42,774 --> 00:28:45,042
And I would gladly invite
you all in right now, but...

589
00:28:45,077 --> 00:28:47,345
We should totally do,
like, a battle scene!

590
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:49,514
Gunter, no, not now.

591
00:28:49,547 --> 00:28:51,616
I just need a little
more time to, you know,

592
00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:54,452
hammer out a few minor, little
details, so would it be okay

593
00:28:54,485 --> 00:28:56,454
if you all could
come back in, like,

594
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:58,356
I don't know, an hour?
Or maybe four?

595
00:28:58,389 --> 00:29:00,424

your patience.

Hmm. Okay.

00:29:03,828 --> 00:29:06,397
Okay.
That was not a great start.

599
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,734
- Oh, look, it's a gift from Mr. Crystal.
- Huh.

609
00:29:33,591 --> 00:29:36,427
Okay, um, on behalf
of myself and the cast,

610
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,829
I just want to say that

611
00:29:37,862 --> 00:29:39,964
to be given
this incredible opportunity

612
00:29:39,997 --> 00:29:42,600
to work with you all here
at the Crystal Tower Theater,

613
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:44,535
well, it's an honor
for all of us.

614
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:46,838
And I believe that, together,
we can make a show

615
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:48,906
that'll take the audience
out of this world.

616
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:53,511
And a big thanks
to Steve over here

617
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:55,446
for staying up all night
to make this model.

618
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:56,881
Great work, Steve.

619
00:29:56,914 --> 00:29:58,916
And here she is, folks.

620
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,552
The star of our show, Rosita.

621
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:03,888
That's you, baby!

622
00:30:03,921 --> 00:30:05,489
The lead role?

623
00:30:05,523 --> 00:30:07,625
Trust me,
you are perfect for it.

624
00:30:09,527 --> 00:30:11,129
Wait till my kids
hear about this.

625
00:30:11,163 --> 00:30:13,131
And so the story goes like this.

626
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:15,466
Rosita plays
an astronaut searching

627
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:17,501
for a missing space explorer.

628
00:30:17,535 --> 00:30:19,470
Together,
with their trusty robot...

629
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:21,639
- That's me.
- Mm-hmm, yes.

630
00:30:21,672 --> 00:30:23,608
They follow the trail
across four planets.

631
00:30:23,641 --> 00:30:26,111
There's a planet of war,
a planet of love,

632
00:30:26,144 --> 00:30:28,146
a one of despair and one of joy.

633
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,515
And each planet will have its
own spectacular musical number

634
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:34,152
performed by one of our terrific cast.

635
00:30:34,186 --> 00:30:36,587
A-And how does it end?
Do I find the explorer?

636
00:30:36,621 --> 00:30:39,157
Oh, we have no clue what
we're going to do at the end.

637
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:40,725
Gunter, no, no, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

638
00:30:40,758 --> 00:30:43,494
We do have great ideas
for the ending.

639
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:44,962
We just... All right.

640
00:30:44,996 --> 00:30:47,099
We've only got three weeks
to make this reality, folks.

641
00:30:47,132 --> 00:30:48,499
Let's get to work.

642
00:30:48,532 --> 00:30:50,568
Johnny, you are gonna play

643
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:53,037
an alien warrior
in a fantastic battle scene.

644
00:30:53,071 --> 00:30:54,872
- Yes!
- Come with me.

645
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,649
Johnny, I want you to meet
your fellow dancers.

646
00:31:04,682 --> 00:31:06,817
- Hello, lads.
- Hey, how you doing?

647
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:08,819
Uh, wait. You said
mine was a battle scene.

648
00:31:08,853 --> 00:31:12,090
Well, it is, but Gunter saw it
as more of a... a dance battle.

649
00:31:12,124 --> 00:31:14,059
- Yeah!
- Okay...

650
00:31:14,092 --> 00:31:15,960
Johnny, don't worry.
You're gonna be working with

651
00:31:15,993 --> 00:31:18,196
the number one choreographer
in Redshore City.

652
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,499
"Klaus Kickenklober."

653
00:31:21,532 --> 00:31:23,768
Yep. Klaus will turn you
into a pro in no time.

654
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:24,969
- Okay.
- Uh...

655
00:31:25,002 --> 00:31:26,938
Mr. Moon?

656
00:31:26,971 --> 00:31:28,673
Meena, you okay?

657
00:31:28,706 --> 00:31:32,510
Gunter said I'm in
a romantic scene and, uh, uh...

658
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:34,545
I have to kiss someone.

659
00:31:34,578 --> 00:31:36,214
Yeah.
It's gonna be an amazing,

660
00:31:36,248 --> 00:31:37,949
beautiful, romantic scene.

661
00:31:37,982 --> 00:31:39,717
Mr. Moon, I've never even had

662
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,519
a boyfriend
or any of that stuff.

663
00:31:41,552 --> 00:31:42,787
Ah, don't you worry.

664
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,057
I'm gonna cast
a great partner for you.

665
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,724
- Promise?
- Promise.

666
00:31:46,757 --> 00:31:48,726
Mr. Moon, we're ready
to start building

667
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,594
the rest of the sets and...

668
00:31:50,628 --> 00:31:51,963
Okay, okay, okay, listen.

669
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:53,931
I don't exactly know
what they are yet,

670
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:56,901
so could you give me one more
night to figure this out?

671
00:31:56,934 --> 00:31:59,003
Hey, this guy
doesn't have it figured out,

672
00:31:59,036 --> 00:32:00,972
so we can't start work right now.

673
00:32:01,005 --> 00:32:02,240
Mason?

674
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:03,708
- Did everybody hear that?
- Hey, don't...

675
00:32:03,741 --> 00:32:05,177
He does not have the show
figured out.

676
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,944
I'm looking into his eyes,

677
00:32:06,978 --> 00:32:08,980
- and all I see is fear.
- Uh-uh. Mm-mm.

678
00:32:09,013 --> 00:32:10,282
Hey, hey, hey, listen, listen...

679
00:32:10,315 --> 00:32:11,816
- And a little bit of shame.
- Yeah, yeah.

680
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:13,851
Look, I-I think
everyone heard you, Mason.

681
00:32:13,884 --> 00:32:14,852
Thank you so much.

682
00:32:14,885 --> 00:32:16,954
Gunter...
we have work to do.

683
00:32:16,988 --> 00:32:19,790
And then I'm thinking,
Ash, you know, she can, like,

684
00:32:19,824 --> 00:32:21,926
totally have a duet
with Clay Calloway,

685
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:24,862
'cause, like, she's a star
that is, like,

686
00:32:24,895 --> 00:32:27,265
guiding them all the way
back home again.

687
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,800
Yes, Gunter.
That's perfect for Ash.

688
00:32:31,136 --> 00:32:33,604
Mommy!

689
00:32:33,637 --> 00:32:35,806
Oh, my darlings, you're here.

690
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,907
Yeah, Johnny!

691
00:32:36,941 --> 00:32:38,642
Oh.

692
00:32:38,676 --> 00:32:40,845
My gosh, I wasn't
expecting you till the morning.

693
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:43,181
I know, but they couldn't
wait to see you.

694
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:45,016
The star of the show, huh?

695
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:46,584
Can you believe it?

696
00:32:46,617 --> 00:32:48,120
It's literally
my dream come true.

697
00:32:48,153 --> 00:32:50,322
- I know. Mwah.
- Ew.

698
00:32:50,355 --> 00:32:52,556
I am so proud of you, honey.

699
00:32:53,924 --> 00:32:55,160
Uh... help.

700
00:32:55,193 --> 00:32:57,828
Mr. Moon, I found him.

701
00:32:57,862 --> 00:33:00,598
- Clay Calloway?
- Yeah. I found his home address.

702
00:33:00,631 --> 00:33:02,267
No way.

703
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,768
Yes way.

704
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:05,237
Miss Crawly, I'm gonna need you

705
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,804
to go visit him
first thing tomorrow.

706
00:33:06,837 --> 00:33:08,672
- Oh, yes, sir.
- You'll need to rent a car

707
00:33:08,706 --> 00:33:11,042
and take him a letter and, uh,
maybe that fruit basket.

708
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:12,144
Yes, the fruit basket.

709
00:33:12,177 --> 00:33:13,644
- You got that?
- Got it.

710
00:33:14,812 --> 00:33:17,082
And one, two, three, four,

711
00:33:17,115 --> 00:33:19,184
five, six, seven, eight.

712
00:33:19,217 --> 00:33:21,053
We're dancing. We're dancing.

713
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:23,020
We're holding. We're holding.

714
00:33:23,055 --> 00:33:24,322
Stay en pointe.

715
00:33:24,356 --> 00:33:26,724
Shuffle and hold.

716
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:29,361
I said hold, Johnny.
He's not holding.

717
00:33:29,394 --> 00:33:31,829
- And one, two, three, four...
- All right, I'm... I am trying.

718
00:33:31,862 --> 00:33:35,666
Let's not forget,
this is Redshore City,

719
00:33:35,699 --> 00:33:37,202
not your little local theater.

720
00:33:37,235 --> 00:33:39,337
And five, six, seven, eight.

721
00:33:39,371 --> 00:33:41,206
Ryan, that was excellent.

722
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:43,674
Johnny, you are doing it wrong.

723
00:33:43,707 --> 00:33:44,842
That was awful.

724
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,244
Come on, Johnny.
You can do better.

725
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:47,878
- He's freaking me out.
- Johnny.

726
00:33:47,912 --> 00:33:50,014
- I'm trying.
- Thrust.

727
00:33:50,047 --> 00:33:51,615
And thrust, and thrust.

728
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:52,950
You're not thrusting, Johnny.

729
00:33:52,983 --> 00:33:54,652
- Come on. Thrust.
- Thrust, and thrust.

730
00:33:54,685 --> 00:33:56,720
Still not thrusting.
Can you thrust, please?

731
00:33:56,754 --> 00:34:00,624
Five, six, seven,
and tippy-toes, tippy-toes.

732
00:34:00,658 --> 00:34:02,360
I don't see your tippy-toes.

733
00:34:02,394 --> 00:34:04,162
Oh, come on,
he's having a laugh.

734
00:34:04,196 --> 00:34:06,098
- Tippy-toes. Come on, let's go.
- Seven, and...

735
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:09,600
That is rubbish,
terribly poor, really bad.

736
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:14,406
That bloke absolutely hates me.

737
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:16,141
Hang in there, Johnny.

738
00:34:16,174 --> 00:34:17,775
The first week's always tough.

739
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:19,743
Yeah. You're right.
You're right.

740
00:34:19,777 --> 00:34:21,679
Meena, come and meet
your partner.

741
00:34:21,712 --> 00:34:22,746
Oh, my gosh, he's here?

742
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,316
Yep. He's called Darius.

743
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:25,916
Won a ton of awards.

Mr. Calloway?

797
00:37:27,031 --> 00:37:28,899
Hello?

798
00:37:28,932 --> 00:37:31,035
Is anybody home?

00:37:40,278 --> 00:37:41,346

Oopsie-daisy.

803
00:38:29,927 --> 00:38:31,262
Hello.

804
00:38:31,296 --> 00:38:33,631
I can't take your call
right now,

805
00:38:33,665 --> 00:38:37,102
but please leave me a message
after the beep.

806
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,305
Miss Crawly, it's me, Mr. Moon.

807
00:38:40,338 --> 00:38:42,107
I haven't heard from you
in a while.

808
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,508
I'm starting to worry here.

809
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:44,975
Moon!

810
00:38:45,008 --> 00:38:46,644
Mr. Crystal.

811
00:38:46,678 --> 00:38:49,381
Your set designs are a disgrace.

812
00:38:49,414 --> 00:38:51,014
What?

813
00:38:52,317 --> 00:38:54,686
I'm just messing with you.

814
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:56,987
Where's your sense of humor,
huh?

815
00:38:58,256 --> 00:39:00,392
Anyway, this is
my daughter Porsha.

816
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:01,659
Hey.

817
00:39:01,693 --> 00:39:03,294
Nice to meet you, Porsha.

818
00:39:03,328 --> 00:39:05,296
She wants to meet Calloway.
Big fan, aren't you, baby?

819
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:08,199
Oh, my gosh, I'm, like,
so into vintage right now.

820
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:09,467
So, where is he?

821
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:11,269
Uh, well...

822
00:39:11,302 --> 00:39:13,971
I-I'm not expecting Clay
on set just yet.

823
00:39:14,004 --> 00:39:15,407
- I mean...
- Wait.

824
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,007
Is this, like, a sky-fi show?

825
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,544
Uh, sci-fi? Yes. Yes, it is.

826
00:39:19,577 --> 00:39:22,380
Oh, my gosh, I love sky-fi.

827
00:39:22,414 --> 00:39:23,681
Mr. Moon!

828
00:39:23,715 --> 00:39:25,949
- We're ready on the tower.
- Oh.

829
00:39:25,983 --> 00:39:27,352
Thank you, Sasha. We, uh...

830
00:39:27,385 --> 00:39:29,287
We're gonna rehearse,
Mr. Crystal, so...

831
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,556
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You go
and do your rehearsing thing.

832
00:39:31,589 --> 00:39:33,258
- Go, go, go, go.
- Playback.

833
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:37,362

835
00:39:38,263 --> 00:39:40,064

the safety catch

836
00:39:40,098 --> 00:39:41,566
before you jump, okay?

837
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,101
Okay, yeah.

838
00:39:43,134 --> 00:39:45,002
Is Mommy gonna jump off that?

839
00:39:45,035 --> 00:39:46,571

850
00:40:13,765 --> 00:40:16,634
Mr. Moon,
I think Rosita's having, like,

851
00:40:16,668 --> 00:40:19,204
a major freak-out up here.

852
00:40:19,237 --> 00:40:20,205
Oh, no.

853
00:40:20,238 --> 00:40:22,005
Hey, Moon, you really think
the mommy pig's

854
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:23,341
gonna pull this off?

855
00:40:23,374 --> 00:40:24,209
Mommy pig?

856
00:40:24,242 --> 00:40:26,077
Absolutely, sir.

857
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:29,046
Believe me, there's nothing
Rosita can't do.

858
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,149
- I can't do this.
- Why didn't you tell me

859
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:32,617
- you were afraid of heights?
- I wasn't.

860
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,619
I-I mean, I've never been
afraid in my whole life before,

861
00:40:34,652 --> 00:40:36,788
but I... suddenly, I just...

862
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:39,090
I don't know
what happened to me.

863
00:40:39,123 --> 00:40:41,493
- Did my kids see that?
- Hey, you guys.

864
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:43,261
What's going on up here?

865
00:40:43,294 --> 00:40:44,562
Who is that?

866
00:40:44,596 --> 00:40:46,097
Ooh. Can I try?

867
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,232
No, no, no, no, no, no.

868
00:40:47,265 --> 00:40:49,067
I-I can't let you jump off here.

869
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,769
Daddy, he won't let me jump!

870
00:40:51,803 --> 00:40:54,072
Moon, come on.
Let her do the thing.

871
00:40:54,105 --> 00:40:55,807
- Yay!
- Porsha, wait!

872
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,576
Whoa, hey. Uh, just a minute.

873
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:04,749
I love it!

874
00:41:04,782 --> 00:41:06,784
Whee! It's easy!

875
00:41:06,818 --> 00:41:08,686
All right,
let's get you down, Rosita.

876
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,321
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

877
00:41:10,355 --> 00:41:13,324
This is exactly like
the dream I had last night.

878
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:16,160
Seriously,
you-you were all there.

879
00:41:16,194 --> 00:41:19,130
And you and you and that
funny-looking guy over there.

880
00:41:19,163 --> 00:41:20,798
- Um...
- All of you.

881
00:41:20,832 --> 00:41:23,701
And you asked me
to sing for you.

882
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:26,204
I... I did?

883
00:41:26,237 --> 00:41:29,274
Yeah. And so, I was like...

884
00:41:29,307 --> 00:41:34,579
♪ This girl is on fire ♪

885
00:41:34,612 --> 00:41:39,751
♪ This girl is
on fire ♪

886
00:41:39,784 --> 00:41:44,822
♪ She's walking on fire ♪

887
00:41:44,856 --> 00:41:50,061
♪ This girl is on fire. ♪

888
00:41:51,596 --> 00:41:54,465
Well, that's a lovely dream
you had there, Porsha.

889
00:41:54,499 --> 00:41:57,535
Um, okay, everybody, back
to first positions, please.

890
00:41:57,569 --> 00:41:58,836
Here, Rosita.

891
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,405
You want to try
with the helmet this time?

892
00:42:00,438 --> 00:42:02,774
Oh, but now I know
what the dream meant.

893
00:42:02,807 --> 00:42:05,143
Yeah. She's afraid.

894
00:42:05,176 --> 00:42:07,245
She'll never be able
to play the part.

895
00:42:07,278 --> 00:42:11,182
But here I am, and I'm young,
and I'm not afraid at all.

896
00:42:11,215 --> 00:42:14,786
I-I can't just give you
Rosita's part. I mean...

897
00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:16,888
Moon, walk with me.

898
00:42:16,921 --> 00:42:18,790
What's wrong with you, huh?

899
00:42:18,823 --> 00:42:20,425
What, you got a kink
in your think?

900
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:22,460
It's just that I wrote
this part for Rosita and...

901
00:42:22,493 --> 00:42:24,462
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let me tell you something, Moon.

902
00:42:24,495 --> 00:42:27,899
What you got here is an
opportunity to make me happy.

903
00:42:27,932 --> 00:42:30,201
And when an opportunity
like that comes along,

904
00:42:30,234 --> 00:42:31,903
you'd better grab it!

905
00:42:31,936 --> 00:42:33,538
You get me?

906
00:42:33,571 --> 00:42:35,239
- Uh...
- What?

907
00:42:35,273 --> 00:42:37,542
You don't think my daughter's
good enough for your show?

908
00:42:37,575 --> 00:42:40,144
No, Mr. Crystal.
Well, I-I think she's wonderful.

909
00:42:40,178 --> 00:42:41,913
Oh, good.
So you'll figure it out.

910
00:42:41,946 --> 00:42:43,815
I'll... Yes, I will.

911
00:42:43,848 --> 00:42:45,750
Daddy, I'm hungry
for French toast.

912
00:42:45,783 --> 00:42:47,251
Jerry!

913
00:42:47,285 --> 00:42:49,153
- Yes, sir.
- Get her some French toast.

914
00:42:49,187 --> 00:42:50,421
And, by the way, I like the set.

915
00:42:50,455 --> 00:42:52,624
That whole
"rings moving around" thing.

916
00:42:52,657 --> 00:42:54,392
Creative, quirky. I like it.

917
00:42:54,425 --> 00:42:55,560
Bye, Daddy.

918
00:42:55,593 --> 00:42:57,528
Mm-kay.
Let's have Porsha measured

919
00:42:57,562 --> 00:42:58,896
for a costume
right away, please.

920
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,398
Yes, right away, people.

921
00:43:00,431 --> 00:43:01,899
Would you just get
the French toast, Jerry?

922
00:43:01,933 --> 00:43:03,935
I'm getting
the French toast, Suki.

923
00:43:03,968 --> 00:43:05,169
You okay?

924
00:43:05,203 --> 00:43:07,271
A little shaky, but I'm okay.

925
00:43:07,305 --> 00:43:09,307
Yeah. You know, uh...

926
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,376
Look, maybe this is
for the best, huh?

927
00:43:11,409 --> 00:43:13,878
I mean, you really were
scared up there.

928
00:43:13,911 --> 00:43:15,313
Right.

929
00:43:15,346 --> 00:43:16,648
I'll write you another part,
Rosita.

930
00:43:16,681 --> 00:43:19,250
A really... a really,
really great part.

931
00:43:19,283 --> 00:43:21,185
- You all right?
- Oh, I'm fine.

932
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:22,787
- Really?
- Yes. You're all very sweet,

933
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:26,357
but like Mr. Moon says,
this is probably for the best.

934
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:28,192
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

935
00:43:28,226 --> 00:43:30,461
I am completely fine with this.

936
00:43:37,235 --> 00:43:38,670
Hey, honey.

937
00:43:38,703 --> 00:43:41,706
Are you... you-you're sure
you're not, you know, upset?

938
00:43:41,739 --> 00:43:43,408
No, I-I'm good.

939
00:43:43,441 --> 00:43:46,277
Um, can I please just have
the bathroom to myself

940
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:48,446
- for five minutes?
- You got it.

941
00:43:48,479 --> 00:43:50,948
Okay, kids, go get your jammies on!

942
00:43:53,618 --> 00:43:56,220
Thank you for choosing
to drive with Royalty.

943
00:43:57,822 --> 00:43:59,557

949

Oh, I thought maybe
you had been involved

959
00:44:44,368 --> 00:44:46,370
in a terrible accident
and we'd never have to

see you again, but never mind.

00:48:52,616 --> 00:48:53,784
Hey. Who are you?

1045
00:48:53,818 --> 00:48:55,153
Ah, it's all right.
She's with me.

1046
00:48:55,187 --> 00:48:56,787
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Nooshy.

1047
00:48:56,821 --> 00:48:58,990
I'm his dance coach.
And I really love that hat.

1048
00:48:59,023 --> 00:49:01,159
She's right. Great hat.

1049
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:05,963
You think some riffraff
street dancer

1050
00:49:05,997 --> 00:49:07,232
can help you more than me?

1051
00:49:07,265 --> 00:49:08,866
- Riffraff?
- Okay, okay. Hang on.

1052
00:49:08,899 --> 00:49:10,634
She's just gonna give me
some extra lessons, that's all.

1053
00:49:10,668 --> 00:49:13,604
Oh, because I,
Klaus Kickenklober,

1054
00:49:13,637 --> 00:49:17,008
master choreographer,
am not good enough for Johnny.

1055
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:20,145
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Yes, I'm irrelevant to him.

1056
00:49:20,178 --> 00:49:22,880
I'm just a stupid,
fat, old monkey.

1057
00:49:22,913 --> 00:49:24,749
- I don't think that at all.
- I do.

1058
00:49:24,782 --> 00:49:26,218
Shh! Please.

1059
00:49:26,251 --> 00:49:27,885
She's only trying
to help me, that's all.

1060
00:49:27,918 --> 00:49:30,088
Dude, anyway, I only need
two days with him.

1061
00:49:30,122 --> 00:49:32,057
Two days? Ha!

1062
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:33,724
200 years, more like.

1063
00:49:33,758 --> 00:49:35,160
Two days. He'll be amazing.

1064
00:49:35,193 --> 00:49:36,694
Oh, really?

1065
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:41,766
Well, if he is,
I will eat my hat.

1066
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:44,269
<i>Okay, everybody, from the top.</i>

1067
00:49:44,302 --> 00:49:46,771
Stand by, playback.

1068
00:49:46,804 --> 00:49:48,906
Lots of energy now, and...

1069
00:49:48,939 --> 00:49:51,042
Wha...?

1070
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,279
Miss Crawly?

1071
00:49:54,312 --> 00:49:56,781
You can't go back there,
Mr. Moon.

1072
00:49:56,814 --> 00:49:58,649
- Never. Never.
- What? What happened to you?

1073
00:49:58,682 --> 00:50:01,652
That lion, you see,
he's crazy. Crazy!

1074
00:50:01,685 --> 00:50:04,189
Oh, he's crazy.

1075
00:50:04,222 --> 00:50:06,324
Pew. Pew, pew.

1076
00:50:06,358 --> 00:50:07,858
- Wow, she's a mess.
- Pew, pew! Pew...

1077
00:50:07,892 --> 00:50:09,693
So, you're not gonna
go out there, are you?

1078
00:50:09,727 --> 00:50:10,961
Gonna have to. I mean...

1079
00:50:10,995 --> 00:50:12,596
All set over here, Mr. Moon.

1080
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,765
Okay. Playback!

1081
00:50:16,268 --> 00:50:18,303
Stand by, Rosita.

1082
00:50:18,336 --> 00:50:20,805
And... action!

1083
00:50:20,838 --> 00:50:23,707

1092
00:50:43,361 --> 00:50:45,130
Did I do good?

1093
00:50:45,163 --> 00:50:46,964
Yeah.

1094
00:50:46,997 --> 00:50:49,367
That was so good.

1095
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:50,968
Yay!

1096
00:50:51,001 --> 00:50:52,337
Did you hear that?

1097
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,239
He thinks I'm awesome.

1098
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,310
Okay, she cannot act.

1099
00:50:58,343 --> 00:50:59,910
Shh. I know. I know.

1100
00:50:59,944 --> 00:51:01,745
But I got to keep
Mr. Crystal happy.

1101
00:51:01,779 --> 00:51:04,715
Take that, you nasty
alien monster.

1102
00:51:04,748 --> 00:51:06,784
Excuse me, but Mr. Crystal
wants to see you.

1103
00:51:06,817 --> 00:51:08,786
Take that,
you nasty alien monster.

1104
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:10,654
Oh. Well, I could come by
this afternoon.

1105
00:51:10,688 --> 00:51:12,656
He means now. Right now.

1106
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:15,626
O... kay.

1107
00:51:16,694 --> 00:51:18,230
You wanted to see me, sir?

1108
00:51:18,263 --> 00:51:20,265
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

1109
00:51:20,298 --> 00:51:21,999
- Come on in.
- Whoa.

1110
00:51:22,032 --> 00:51:24,202
This place is incredible.

1111
00:51:24,236 --> 00:51:26,036
Pretty great, huh?

1112
00:51:26,071 --> 00:51:28,206
So, how's it going
with Calloway?

1113
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,040
Calloway?

1114
00:51:30,075 --> 00:51:31,909
It's, uh... it's good.

1115
00:51:31,942 --> 00:51:34,812
- Yeah. Very good.
- Right, right.

1116
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:36,181
Well, let me ask you something.

1117
00:51:36,214 --> 00:51:38,883
What did I do to make you
disrespect me, huh?

1118
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:39,683
What?

1119
00:51:39,717 --> 00:51:41,219
Oh, what?
You think I'm an idiot?

1120
00:51:41,253 --> 00:51:42,753
Some kind of bozo?

1121
00:51:42,786 --> 00:51:44,755
No. No, sir, not at all.

1122
00:51:44,788 --> 00:51:48,193
My team, they talked
to Calloway's lawyer,

1123
00:51:48,226 --> 00:51:52,397
and they say he's never
heard of you or your show.

1124
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,732
Really? They said that? Uh...

1125
00:51:54,765 --> 00:51:56,734
- You lied to me!
- I-I didn't mean to.

1126
00:51:56,767 --> 00:51:58,969
Okay? Honestly, I really
thought I could get him.

1127
00:51:59,003 --> 00:52:01,106
No one makes me look
like a fool! No one!

1128
00:52:01,139 --> 00:52:03,108
I-I wouldn't dream of doing that to you.

1129
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:05,310
I swear, if you didn't have
my kid in your show,

1130
00:52:05,343 --> 00:52:07,044
you'd be out
of that window by now!

1131
00:52:07,078 --> 00:52:08,779
Please, please, please.
I-I'm so sorry.

1132
00:52:08,812 --> 00:52:10,415
You'd better have Calloway
by the end of next week,

1133
00:52:10,448 --> 00:52:12,450
- or so help me!
- I-I-I will.

1134
00:52:12,484 --> 00:52:15,453
I-I-I'll get him.
I won't let you down, sir.

1135
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:19,090
Oh, I know
you won't let me down.

1136
00:52:19,124 --> 00:52:21,459
- Jerry, get in here!
- Yes, sir. Right here, sir.

1137
00:52:21,493 --> 00:52:24,028
- Clean this mess up, will you?
- Yes, absolutely, I'd love to.

1138
00:52:25,096 --> 00:52:26,830
Listen up.
I got to go to Calloway's,

1139
00:52:26,864 --> 00:52:28,400
and I got to go ASAP.

1140
00:52:28,433 --> 00:52:30,202
- Oh, no, please don't go there.
- D-Don't worry. Don't worry.

1141
00:52:30,235 --> 00:52:32,337
I know you said he's crazy,
but I'll be all right.

1142
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:34,439
- Oh, can I go with you, please?
- Uh, I don't know.

1143
00:52:34,472 --> 00:52:35,940
Come on, you're gonna need me.

1144
00:52:35,973 --> 00:52:37,741
I know everything
about this guy.

1145
00:52:37,775 --> 00:52:39,977
- Uh... I think you're right.
- Yes!

1146
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,946
Now, listen, Gunter,
you've got to figure out

1147
00:52:41,979 --> 00:52:43,515
the ending of this show
on your own.

1148
00:52:43,548 --> 00:52:45,217
- On my own?
- Yes.

1149
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,485
Miss Crawly, I need you
to take charge while I'm away.

1150
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:49,019
- Yes, sir.
- Now, listen to me.

1151
00:52:49,054 --> 00:52:50,888
You got to bring
your A game here, Miss Crawly.

1152
00:52:50,921 --> 00:52:52,224
I'm serious.
You got to be tough.

1153
00:52:52,257 --> 00:52:54,459
- Yes, I got to be tough.
- You got to be firm.

1154
00:52:54,492 --> 00:52:55,960
Oh, and I got to be firm. Yes.

1155
00:52:55,993 --> 00:52:57,828
And you cannot...
I repeat, cannot...

1156
00:52:57,861 --> 00:52:59,830
let production fall behind,
not one little bit.

1157
00:52:59,863 --> 00:53:00,965
Is that clear?

1158
00:53:00,998 --> 00:53:02,833
Yes, sir, Mr. Moon, sir.

1159
00:53:09,873 --> 00:53:11,243
Mason!

1160
00:53:11,276 --> 00:53:13,545
That volcano should've been
finished yesterday!

1161
00:53:13,578 --> 00:53:15,913
- W-We're on it, Miss Crawly.
- You better be!

1162
00:53:15,946 --> 00:53:18,316
Meena, Darius,
take it from the top,

1163
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:21,253
and this time, put a little
juice in it, will you?

1164
00:53:21,286 --> 00:53:23,521
I'm trying my best, Miss Crawly.

1165
00:53:23,555 --> 00:53:25,523
A little juice?

1166
00:53:25,557 --> 00:53:27,925
Hey, everybody.

1167
00:53:30,562 --> 00:53:32,896
You're two hours late
for rehearsal!

1168
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:35,267
Wait. Wait, where's the koala?

1169
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,434
Who are you?

1170
00:53:36,468 --> 00:53:38,002
I'm in charge! That's who!

1171
00:53:38,035 --> 00:53:40,838
Now, get your tail to wardrobe,
sweetheart.

1172
00:53:52,617 --> 00:53:54,286
Oh, my gosh.

1173
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:55,487
There he is.

1174
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,522
That's him.

1175
00:53:57,555 --> 00:54:00,525
Holy moly, it really is.

1176
00:54:00,558 --> 00:54:03,194
He doesn't look so scary.

1177
00:54:03,228 --> 00:54:05,096
Mr. Calloway!

1178
00:54:05,929 --> 00:54:08,099
- Go away!
- No, please.

1179
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:10,402
We-we-we just want to talk
to you for one minute.

1180
00:54:10,435 --> 00:54:12,237
That's all.

1181
00:54:13,904 --> 00:54:17,342
We are not leaving
until you talk to us.

1182
00:54:18,476 --> 00:54:20,844
Fine. If you're not
coming over here,

1183
00:54:20,878 --> 00:54:22,980
we're coming over to you.

1184
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:24,848
No! Stay off the fence!

1185
00:54:24,882 --> 00:54:26,284
Don't listen to him.

1186
00:55:00,352 --> 00:55:01,619
Stop, stop, stop!

1187
00:55:01,653 --> 00:55:03,555
Porsha, you're still
messing it up.

1188
00:55:03,588 --> 00:55:05,457
It's not my fault.

1189
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:07,392
He keeps missing the catch.

1190
00:55:07,425 --> 00:55:09,893
I think she's trying to kill me.

1191
00:55:09,927 --> 00:55:11,429
Reset. Let's go again.

1192
00:55:11,463 --> 00:55:13,164
Meena! Darius!

1193
00:55:13,198 --> 00:55:15,400
We're coming to you next,
and I better see

1194
00:55:15,433 --> 00:55:17,669
some chemistry between you two.

1195
00:55:17,702 --> 00:55:20,105
Okay, let's run these steps
one more time.

1196
00:55:20,138 --> 00:55:23,675
So, music starts, I step out,

1197
00:55:23,708 --> 00:55:25,976
do my moves, fancy moves.

1198
00:55:26,009 --> 00:55:27,412
Step together, drop.

1199
00:55:27,445 --> 00:55:32,083
Gazing at each other like
we're burning up with love...

1200
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:35,018
What are you doing
with your face?

1201
00:55:36,521 --> 00:55:38,289
Your face looks broken.

1202
00:55:38,323 --> 00:55:39,657
What is that?

1203
00:55:39,691 --> 00:55:41,126
Uh...

1204
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:43,628
I was falling in love?

1205
00:55:43,661 --> 00:55:45,563
Yeah, Gina, listen.

1206
00:55:45,597 --> 00:55:47,699
I'm sorry, that-that's not what

1207
00:55:47,732 --> 00:55:49,501
falling in love with me
looks like.

1208
00:55:49,534 --> 00:55:51,069
I... I should know.

1209
00:55:51,102 --> 00:55:53,036
I see it day after day,
week after week.

1210
00:55:53,071 --> 00:55:55,038
Let's run it again.

1211
00:55:55,073 --> 00:55:57,609
From the top!
And five, six, seven, eight.

1212
00:55:57,642 --> 00:55:59,411
And one...

1213
00:56:03,548 --> 00:56:06,418
Would you like
some ice cream, ma'am?

1214
00:56:06,451 --> 00:56:10,321
Or should I say, Your Majesty?

1215
00:56:11,322 --> 00:56:12,290
Uh...

1216
00:56:12,323 --> 00:56:14,359
I just...
You look like a goddess,

1217
00:56:14,392 --> 00:56:17,195
and, uh...
and-and-and lucky for you,

1218
00:56:17,228 --> 00:56:19,697
it's "free ice cream
for all goddesses" day.

1219
00:56:19,731 --> 00:56:22,534
Aw.

1220
00:56:34,145 --> 00:56:37,282
That's cherry cheesecake,
and I-I make it all myself.

1221
00:56:37,315 --> 00:56:39,317
See, my truck's
right over there.

1222
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:41,319
Come by anytime...

1223
00:56:41,352 --> 00:56:43,288
Your Majesty.

1224
00:56:45,156 --> 00:56:47,991
Ooh, that... Are you okay?

1225
00:57:00,738 --> 00:57:02,774
Buster?

1226
00:57:04,642 --> 00:57:06,377
You okay?

1227
00:57:07,245 --> 00:57:09,647
Ash?

1228
00:57:09,681 --> 00:57:11,483
Where are we?

1229
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:14,252
We're in Clay's house.

1230
00:57:14,285 --> 00:57:15,086
Oh, my gosh.

1231
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,255
- Have you talked to him yet?
- Uh-huh.

1232
00:57:17,288 --> 00:57:19,390
- You have?
- We were just discussing

1233
00:57:19,424 --> 00:57:21,493
whether he'd consider
being in our show.

1234
00:57:21,526 --> 00:57:22,660
What did he say?

1235
00:57:22,694 --> 00:57:24,696
He said no.

1236
00:57:24,729 --> 00:57:28,433
Not in a million years.

1237
00:57:29,434 --> 00:57:31,302
Please, Mr. Calloway.

1238
00:57:31,336 --> 00:57:33,505
Look, you don't...
you don't realize how much

1239
00:57:33,538 --> 00:57:36,107
it would mean to have you in our show and...

1240
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,609
Will you stop your yakking?

1241
00:57:39,677 --> 00:57:41,079
Here.

1242
00:57:41,112 --> 00:57:44,382
Your friend left this
on my property.

1243
00:57:50,455 --> 00:57:53,191
And I want you gone
in the morning.

1244
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:59,163
And that's why they say,
"Never meet your heroes."

1245
00:57:59,764 --> 00:58:02,267
Step, two, three, four.

1246
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,402
One, two, three, four.

1247
00:58:04,435 --> 00:58:05,603
Yes!

1248
00:58:07,171 --> 00:58:08,473
Whoa, mate.

1249
00:58:08,506 --> 00:58:10,775
You're not ready
to be busting out these moves.

1250
00:58:10,808 --> 00:58:12,310
- Sorry.
- Look at you.

1251
00:58:12,343 --> 00:58:14,245
Klaus has thrown you
in the deep end

1252
00:58:14,279 --> 00:58:16,681
and drained out
all of your confidence like...

1253
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:20,718
Don't worry.

1254
00:58:20,752 --> 00:58:22,453
We'll build up to it
step-by-step.

1255
00:58:22,487 --> 00:58:25,123

But I can't stop.

1280
00:59:47,939 --> 00:59:51,442
It's 'cause I really want
to talk to him.

1281

1282

Whoa!

1289
01:00:16,968 --> 01:00:18,803
And when you see
the sets and the...

1290
01:00:18,836 --> 01:00:20,471
Turn on that tap for me.

01:00:20,505 --> 01:00:21,906
Tap? Uh, sure.

1292
01:00:21,939 --> 01:00:23,741

Oopsie-daisy.

1295
01:00:30,982 --> 01:00:32,984
Moon, you okay?

1296
01:00:33,017 --> 01:00:35,553
I'm okay!

1297
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,825
It's tea.

1298
01:00:40,858 --> 01:00:42,427
You drink it.

1299
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,429
I promise,

1300
01:00:44,462 --> 01:00:46,764
this is going to be
the most wonderful...

1301
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:48,700
I mean, fantastic show ever.

1302
01:00:48,733 --> 01:00:50,334
Did you put honey in this?

1303
01:00:50,368 --> 01:00:52,370
A-And the ending? Oh, boy.

1304
01:00:52,403 --> 01:00:54,972
I mean, i-it's gonna end
with you

1305
01:00:55,006 --> 01:00:56,841
and your song...

1306
01:00:56,874 --> 01:00:58,843
You don't want to do the show.

1307
01:00:58,876 --> 01:01:02,013
Besides,
lost my singing voice, so...

1308
01:01:02,046 --> 01:01:04,649
Your voice sounds fine to me.

1309
01:01:05,717 --> 01:01:07,452
This...

1310
01:01:07,485 --> 01:01:10,855
This is all because
you lost your wife, isn't it?

1311
01:01:10,888 --> 01:01:12,957
Okay, porcupine.

1312
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:14,992
We're not talking about my Ruby.

1313
01:01:15,026 --> 01:01:18,696
Look, I know she inspired
so many of your songs...

1314
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:20,465
All of my songs.

1315
01:01:20,498 --> 01:01:21,399
Right.

1316
01:01:21,432 --> 01:01:24,469
I... I can't imagine
what it must be like

1317
01:01:24,502 --> 01:01:26,671
to lose someone so special,

1318
01:01:26,704 --> 01:01:31,375
but do you think this is what
Ruby would've wanted for you?

1319
01:01:31,409 --> 01:01:35,480
I mean, you out here on your own

1320
01:01:35,513 --> 01:01:37,749
and never singing again?

1321
01:01:37,782 --> 01:01:40,318
No, y-you don't understand.

1322
01:01:40,351 --> 01:01:44,322
There's... there's no rock star
living here anymore.

1323
01:01:44,355 --> 01:01:46,357
Clay, you just need
to play again.

1324
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:48,826
Your songs will bring you back.

1325
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:51,063
You can.
You can reconnect with...

1326
01:01:51,096 --> 01:01:52,697
No, I can't!

1327
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:57,368
I haven't even heard one
of my songs in over 15 years.

1328
01:01:57,401 --> 01:01:59,437
And for good reason.

1329
01:02:02,707 --> 01:02:06,444
Ruby was everything.

1330
01:02:07,678 --> 01:02:11,649
And I don't like honey
in my tea.

1331
01:02:14,452 --> 01:02:16,721
He's not gonna change his mind.

1332
01:02:16,754 --> 01:02:18,090
He will.

1333
01:02:18,123 --> 01:02:19,991
But you should go back.

1334
01:02:20,024 --> 01:02:22,293
Me? What about you?

1335
01:02:22,927 --> 01:02:25,797
I just need time with him.

1336
01:02:26,664 --> 01:02:29,433
I can't just
leave him like this.

1337
01:02:31,536 --> 01:02:33,604
Ten-hut!

1338
01:02:33,638 --> 01:02:36,374
- Whoa.
- Welcome back, Mr. Moon, sir.

1339
01:02:36,407 --> 01:02:38,009
Uh, thank you, Miss Crawly.

1340
01:02:38,042 --> 01:02:39,944
Oh, and I have
something for you.

1341
01:02:39,977 --> 01:02:41,479
Thank you, Mr. Moon, sir.

1342
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:43,781
All right, you can ease off
the attitude now.

1343
01:02:43,815 --> 01:02:45,550
Oh, oh, yes, yes.

1344
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:47,618
So, any luck with Clay Calloway?

1345
01:02:47,652 --> 01:02:48,686
Shh! Not yet.

1346
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:50,955
But if anyone can convince him,
it's Ash, so...

1347
01:02:50,988 --> 01:02:53,791
All right, folks, tomorrow,
we have our first run-through,

1348
01:02:53,825 --> 01:02:56,828
so let's get this show
in shipshape shape.

1349
01:03:39,971 --> 01:03:42,506
And cue Porsha.

1350
01:03:47,912 --> 01:03:49,914
Captain's log.

1351
01:03:49,947 --> 01:03:51,482
I must take care,

1352
01:03:51,515 --> 01:03:55,786
for I have landed
on the Planet of War.

1353
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:59,423
Ooh. Okay, so let's just
hold it right there, folks.

1354
01:03:59,457 --> 01:04:01,126
Uh, everyone, take five.

1355
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:05,596
What the heck is
a captain's log, anyway?

1356
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:09,134
Um, Porsha, can I have a word?

1357
01:04:09,167 --> 01:04:12,170
Porsha, you know I truly believe

1358
01:04:12,204 --> 01:04:13,905
that this show, i-it...

1359
01:04:13,938 --> 01:04:16,908
it's close to being fantastic,
maybe even perfect.

1360
01:04:16,941 --> 01:04:18,776
- Thank you.
- Y-Yeah, yeah,

1361
01:04:18,809 --> 01:04:21,179
but-but, see, to make it
the best it can be...

1362
01:04:22,813 --> 01:04:25,650
...well, I got to make
some changes.

1363
01:04:25,683 --> 01:04:27,219
Uh-huh.

1364
01:04:27,252 --> 01:04:28,819
Like...

1365
01:04:28,853 --> 01:04:30,655
uh...

1366
01:04:30,688 --> 01:04:33,058
I have to give the lead role
back to Rosita.

1367
01:04:33,091 --> 01:04:34,525
What?

1368
01:04:34,558 --> 01:04:35,793
I'm just offering you
the opportunity

1369
01:04:35,826 --> 01:04:38,130
- to switch roles with...
- You're firing me?

1370
01:04:38,163 --> 01:04:39,697
No, I-I'm not firing you.

1371
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:42,200
Oh, wait till my dad hears
that you fired me.

1372
01:04:42,234 --> 01:04:44,602
But I'm not firing you.
Please, wait!

1373
01:04:44,635 --> 01:04:47,139
Oh, my gosh.

1374
01:04:47,172 --> 01:04:49,207
You all hate me, don't you?

1375
01:04:49,241 --> 01:04:52,177
No, no, no, we don't hate you.
We all think you're terrific!

1376
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:53,945
Well, I don't care
if you hate me.

1377
01:04:53,978 --> 01:04:55,213
Please stop.

1378
01:04:55,247 --> 01:04:58,083
You and your stupid,
stupid sky-fi show

1379
01:04:58,116 --> 01:04:59,817
can go to heck!

1380
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:01,953
Porsha, stop. Wait!

1381
01:05:03,587 --> 01:05:06,590

Mr. Crystal. Aah!
I got some great news.

Clay Calloway is

Okay, I think I know what
this might be about, and I...

1434
01:08:51,116 --> 01:08:52,384
You fired Porsha.

1435
01:08:52,417 --> 01:08:54,386
No. No. I never fired her.

1436
01:08:54,419 --> 01:08:56,053
You calling her a liar?

1437
01:08:56,087 --> 01:08:58,889
No, no, no, no,
she just got it wrong, is all.

1438
01:08:58,923 --> 01:09:01,059
I was only trying to help her
do the best she could,

1439
01:09:01,092 --> 01:09:04,795
and be-believe me, I-I-I just
wanted to do the right thing.

1440

The right thing to do...

- But I did!

1450
01:09:24,848 --> 01:09:26,484
- You made me look bad.
- No, no!

1451
01:09:26,518 --> 01:09:27,818
I didn't mean to!

1452
01:09:27,851 --> 01:09:29,354
No!

1453
01:09:29,387 --> 01:09:31,122

01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:01,092
that bully steal
our hopes and dreams.

1560
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:03,761
No, no, no. We are way past
singing and dancing now.

1561
01:14:03,795 --> 01:14:05,463
Look, I-I know
this might sound crazy.

1562
01:14:05,497 --> 01:14:07,632
- If we got the theater back...
- Oh, come on.

1563
01:14:07,665 --> 01:14:09,167
- Just for one night only.
- Seriously?

1564
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,802
It's not like
we can just sneak in there

1565
01:14:10,835 --> 01:14:13,271
and put the show on
behind Crystal's back.

1566
01:14:14,172 --> 01:14:17,175
That is exactly
what we're gonna do.

1567
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:18,176
Yes!

1568
01:14:20,778 --> 01:14:22,714
Maybe it's, like, room service?

1569
01:14:24,282 --> 01:14:26,150
Open up or you're dead, Moon!

1570
01:14:26,184 --> 01:14:28,119
Okay, it's not room service.

1571
01:14:28,152 --> 01:14:30,655
You and your dumb friends
better not be hiding in there.

1572
01:14:30,688 --> 01:14:32,056
What are we gonna do?

1573
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:33,558
Guys, we just
got to be brave now.

1574
01:14:33,591 --> 01:14:35,393
Are you saying
we should fight these thugs?

1575
01:14:35,426 --> 01:14:37,095
No, no.
They'll beat us to a pulp.

1576
01:14:38,296 --> 01:14:39,764
We're gonna put this show on

1577
01:14:39,797 --> 01:14:41,366
whether Crystal likes it or not.

1578
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:44,669
But first, we're gonna jump
out that window.

1579
01:14:44,702 --> 01:14:46,137
What?

1580
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:48,406
I'm beginning to like this guy.

1581
01:14:58,116 --> 01:14:59,684
Security.
Yeah, we got nine suspects

1582
01:14:59,717 --> 01:15:01,252
loose on the river ride.

1583
01:15:01,286 --> 01:15:04,155
Repeat, nine suspects loose
on the river ride.

1584
01:15:04,188 --> 01:15:06,824
Hang on, everybody.

1585
01:15:06,858 --> 01:15:08,560
Uh, this is pool security.

1586
01:15:08,593 --> 01:15:10,395
I don't see anyone here. Over.

1587
01:15:10,428 --> 01:15:11,596
There!

1588
01:15:11,629 --> 01:15:13,865
They're heading east
through the back lot!

1589
01:15:13,898 --> 01:15:15,333
Go, go, go, go, go.

1590
01:15:15,366 --> 01:15:17,468
Oh, I wish I didn't have...

1591
01:15:17,502 --> 01:15:19,170

Well?

Uh, no sign of 'em, sir.

1599
01:15:38,489 --> 01:15:39,857
We think they might
have split town.

1600
01:15:51,536 --> 01:15:54,505
No one is supposed
to be in here.

Uh, who are you?

1602
01:15:57,208 --> 01:15:58,876
We're the night cleaners.

Oh, I see.

1604
01:16:00,411 --> 01:16:02,547
Well, we don't need
any cleaning right now,

1605
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:05,750
but it'd be better
if you didn't leave, so...

1606
01:16:05,783 --> 01:16:08,920
Mm, I don't suppose any of you
can tap-dance, huh?

1607
01:16:08,953 --> 01:16:10,622
Huh.

1608
01:16:10,655 --> 01:16:12,523
Well, let's move it, folks.

01:16:16,661 --> 01:16:18,463
Here, Rosita.

1610

It's your role.

1611
01:16:22,734 --> 01:16:25,637
Miss Crawly, let's see if we
can get us a new green alien.

01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:26,904
Yes, sir, Mr. Moon, sir.

Yeah, well, uh, maybe
I overreacted a little before.

1617
01:16:40,618 --> 01:16:43,388
A little? You were, like,
a total drama queen back there.

Uh, no.

01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:45,376

in the Crystal Tower Theater...

Mr. Crystal's office.

1662
01:18:46,911 --> 01:18:48,379
This is Jerry speaking.

1663
01:18:48,412 --> 01:18:52,383
...a brand-new show
called <i>Out of This World.</i>

1664
01:18:52,416 --> 01:18:55,620
A musical space odyssey
featuring the return of

1665
01:18:55,653 --> 01:18:57,789
the legendary Clay Calloway.

1666
01:18:57,822 --> 01:19:01,059
That's right, Clay Calloway.

1667
01:19:01,093 --> 01:19:04,462
And what's more,
this show is completely free,

1668
01:19:04,495 --> 01:19:07,465
so step right up, folks,
and take your seats.

1669
01:19:07,498 --> 01:19:10,568
The journey of a lifetime
is about to begin.

1670
01:19:10,601 --> 01:19:13,671
All right, folks,
we all set back here?

1671
01:19:13,704 --> 01:19:15,406
There he is!

1672
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:17,041

01:19:17,075 --> 01:19:18,810
- Come here.
- What are you wearing?

01:19:18,843 --> 01:19:20,478
Oh, well, we're still doing

ain't we, lads?

1676
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:23,548
- Yeah.
- That's right.

01:19:23,581 --> 01:19:25,917
Oh, my gosh. He's here.

1678
01:19:25,950 --> 01:19:26,951
Crystal's here?

1679
01:19:26,984 --> 01:19:29,987
No. M-My ice cream guy.

1680
01:19:30,021 --> 01:19:32,090
And he's sitting
in the front row.

1681
01:19:32,124 --> 01:19:34,559
- Mr. Crystal! Mr. Crystal!
- Aah! Jerry!

1682
01:19:34,592 --> 01:19:36,128
- Mr. Crystal, wake up, wake up.
- I tried to stop him, sir.

1683
01:19:36,161 --> 01:19:37,595
I-I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry
to wake you up, sir.

1684
01:19:37,628 --> 01:19:38,963
It's Moon.
He's taken over the theater,

1685
01:19:38,996 --> 01:19:40,598
and he's putting on
a show right now.

1686
01:19:40,631 --> 01:19:42,867
He's what?!

1687
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:53,611
Okay, this is it, guys.
You ready?

1688
01:19:53,644 --> 01:19:55,446
Oh, my gosh.
Are we really doing this?

1689
01:19:55,479 --> 01:19:56,848
Yeah, you better believe it.

1690
01:19:56,881 --> 01:19:59,617
Yeah, big-time, baby!

1691
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:00,718
Remember...

1692
01:20:00,751 --> 01:20:04,522
There's only one way
left to go, and that's up!

1693
01:20:04,555 --> 01:20:06,023
- Yeah!
- Let's do it! Come on!

went missing long ago.

Captain, I am picking up
his signal.

1703
01:20:47,465 --> 01:20:49,901
Excellent.
But from which planet?

1704
01:20:49,934 --> 01:20:51,502
I see four of them ahead.

1705
01:20:51,535 --> 01:20:53,771
It is impossible
to know which one

1706
01:20:53,804 --> 01:20:55,840
the signal is, like,
coming from.

1707
01:20:55,873 --> 01:20:57,142
I see.

1708
01:20:57,175 --> 01:20:59,177
Then I'll have to
explore them all.

1709
01:20:59,211 --> 01:21:01,113
Take us down.

1710
01:21:01,146 --> 01:21:02,880
