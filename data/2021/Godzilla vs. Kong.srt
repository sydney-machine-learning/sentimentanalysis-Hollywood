00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,108
Mm.

3
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,858
<i>Alert, biodome breach.</i>

4
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:16,692
<i>Alert, biodome breach.</i>

5
00:03:19,192 --> 00:03:21,525
Dr. Andrews, did you see that?

6
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:23,775
The habitat's not gonna
hold much longer.

7
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:26,192
We need to start thinking
about off-site solutions.

8
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:28,733
The island is the one thing
that's kept him isolated.

9
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:30,817
If he leaves,
Godzilla will come for him.

10
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,317
There can't be
two alpha Titans.

11
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,275
The whole theory
of an ancient rivalry

12
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:36,817
stems from Iwi mythology.

13
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,192
He's gotten too big over time.

14
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:40,067
This environment
won't sustain much longer.

15
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,608
It's too unstable.

16
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:46,192
Hey.

17
00:03:58,733 --> 00:04:00,900
Off-site would be
a death sentence.

18
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:04,233
You don't think the King
could take care of himself?

19
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:06,358
There has to be another way.

20
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:16,942
<i>Finding the origin

21
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:20,983

24
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,108
<i>joined by natural avenues.</i>

25
00:04:30,192 --> 00:04:32,483
<i>The admiral

26
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:35,025
<i>searching for an entrance

27
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,692
<i>The purpose

28
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:38,192

<i>Members of the lost
party were never seen again.</i>

32
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:49,442
<i>Still no word
on what may have happened.</i>

33
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,150
<i>There's an ecosystem
out there,</i>

34
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:58,567
<i>the likes of which
we can't imagine.</i>

35
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,650
<i>And the place to find it
is this island.</i>

36
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:31,067

<i>Today is the day.</i>

40
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:39,317
<i>Maybe the last podcast
I ever record.</i>

41
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,067
<i>And look, I know
I said that last week</i>

42
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,983
<i>and maybe the week before
and a few other times.</i>

43
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:44,567
<i>But, look, this is the point.</i>

44
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,400
After five years of deep cover
at Apex Cybernetics,

45
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:49,233
I'm finally taking my shot.

46
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:50,900
Something bad
is going on here.

47
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:52,317
I don't know what it is,

48
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,733
but I'm about to walk in
and download hard evidence

49
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:57,317
and expose
a vast corporate conspiracy.

50
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,942
Yeah, you can call me
a whistleblower,

51
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:00,400
but I ain't just whistling.

52
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:03,983
I mean, this is more
than a leak. It's a flood.

53
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:05,775
And believe me, this flood

54
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,942
is gonna wash away
all of Apex's lies.

55
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:10,733
You can believe that.

56
00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:17,983

<i>When we started
Apex Cybernetics,</i>

59
00:07:24,525 --> 00:07:25,942
<i>we dreamt of new ways</i>

60
00:07:26,025 --> 00:07:29,358
<i>to push past the limits

61

<i>And neither are you.</i>

68
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,567
There you are, baby.

69
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:06,150
No, don't eat that!

70
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:07,983
It's incredibly unhealthy.

71
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:10,983
It's just all the GMOs.

72
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:12,567
Growing a second head
could be useful.

73
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,650
You have to let me know.

74
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:15,025
Because me, myself?

75
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:16,650
I can barely handle
the one I got.

76
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:19,692
Bernie, you're not
supposed to be in here.

77
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:22,483
You ever wonder
what we're really doing here?

78
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,067
I mean, really doing here.

79
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,483
Why are you here?

80
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:27,358
This isn't Engineering.

81
00:08:27,442 --> 00:08:28,817
Because, you know,
I had to wait

82
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,192
because they're rendering
these new specs,

83
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:31,983
which is gonna
take over, uh...

84
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:33,400
That's calculator mode.

85
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:35,108
...over one hour,
maybe even more.

86
00:08:35,192 --> 00:08:37,192
So my foreman told me
to just take a walk

87
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:39,733
- and make some new friends.
- Oh.

88
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:41,067
Oh! Now that
we're new friends,

89
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,900
I can share something
with you, right?

90
00:08:42,983 --> 00:08:44,525
I know it's in here somewhere.

91
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,192
This is hand sanitizer that
I made from my own garden.

92
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,525
It's really amazing.

93
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:49,400
Don't know
if I used that or not.

94
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:53,858
Yes. This. Check this out.

95
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:56,608
That right there
is radio mesh networking

96
00:08:56,692 --> 00:08:58,358
with a voice-record
subprocessor.

97
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:00,192
- Guess from where. Come on.
- I don't care.

98
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:01,525
A toaster!

99
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,275
It's from a toaster.
Look at this thing.

100
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:04,900
I have to go to the bathroom.

101
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:06,358
Is it one or two?

102
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:08,025
'Cause if it's two, it's
probably from these apples.

103
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:10,733
Hey, you wanna use the
hand sanitizer that I made?

104
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:11,817
I'm good.

105
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,483
Okay, I'll just stay here.

106
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,775
Okay. Yeah.

107
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,858
Ah, let's see.

108
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:22,025
Whoo.

109
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:25,025
Screen.

110
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,900
What are they shipping
to Hong Kong?

111
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:34,150
What's Sublevel 33?

112
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:37,942
What the...?

113
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:43,400
<i>Evacuation, Titan alert.</i>

114
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,150

116
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:49,358

00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:51,233
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

118

Let's go!

120
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,942
They used
cyanide capsules

121
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:25,483
instead of fallout shelters
to keep the secrets in,

122
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:26,983
but, you know,
that's neither here nor there,

123
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:28,650
so don't listen to me.

124
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:32,525
Level two personnel,
this way! Let's go, let's go!

125
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,150
Yeah, that way.

126
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:45,275
It's time!

127
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:47,733

- No.
- Hey, you!

131
00:11:21,483 --> 00:11:23,400
- Where's your clearance tag?
- You know what?

132
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,858
The fact that
you're talking about

133
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:26,400
clearance tags right now
in a time of crisis

134
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:28,025
is incredibly unprofessional.

135
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:29,942
We should be talking
about evacuation.

136
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:31,150
Yo! Okay!

00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,067
I don't want you to help.
I want you to stay safe.

177
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,067
We needed a plan to keep peace
with these things,

178
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,317
and the best one we had
just went down in flames.

179
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,983
I don't have any more.

180
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,983
And the last thing that I need
is to be worrying about you.

181
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:59,317
Godzilla saved us. You were
there with Mom. You saw it.

182
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,692
How could you doubt him?

183
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:02,358
- There has to be a pattern.
- There doesn't.

184
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,400
- A reason why he was provoked.
- There isn't.

185
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:05,692
How do you know that?

186
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:07,650
Because creatures,
like people, can change.

187
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:09,150
And right now,
Godzilla's out there

188
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:11,275
and he's hurting people,
and we don't know why.

189
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:13,983
So cut your pop some slack,
would ya?

190
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:17,525
See you at home, Dad.

191
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:23,442
<i>You wanna know
my theory?</i>

192
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:25,275
<i>I mean, of course you do.
That's why you're here.</i>

193
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:27,775
<i>Come on, it's all about
patterns and variables.</i>

194
00:14:27,858 --> 00:14:29,567
<i>Oh, wait, stick with me.
I'm gonna take you back</i>

195
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,358
<i>to sixth grade with this,
okay?</i>

196
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:33,858
<i>Godzilla attacks when
provoked, that's the pattern.</i>

197
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:36,567
<i>Pensacola is
the only coastal Apex hub</i>

198
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,817
<i>with an advanced robotics lab.</i>

199
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,150
<i>That's the variable.</i>

200
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:40,983
<i>And add them up
and your answer is</i>

201
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:43,692
<i>that Apex is at the heart
of the problem.</i>

202
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,108
Can I help you?

203
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:05,567
If you want an appointment,

204
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,067
my office hours
are nine to five.

205
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,900
- Please, Dr. Lind.
- What the f...

206
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:12,233
Guys like you and me,

207
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:14,317
we don't do normal hours,
do we?

208
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:18,567
I've been fixated
on Hollow Earth

209
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,067
for as long as you have.

210
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,150
Your theory that it's
the birthplace of all Titans

211
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:24,442
is fascinating.

212
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:26,483
Your book was very impressive.

213
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:29,442
Oh, yeah? Well, I got
about 30 unsold boxes

214
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:31,108
in my apartment
if you want some.

215
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:34,233
Walt Simmons.

216
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:36,108
I know who you are, sir.
It's an honor.

217
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:39,775
No, the honor is mine.
As is the urgency.

218
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:43,150
Godzilla has never attacked us
unprovoked before.

219
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,150
These are dangerous times,
Dr. Lind.

220
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:47,608
Allow me to introduce

221
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:51,400
our Apex chief technology
officer, Mr. Ren Serizawa.

222
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,900
He has an interesting thing
to show you.

223
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:03,025
Magnetic imaging from
one of our new satellites.

224
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:05,650
You know what this is, right?

225
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:07,067
Hollow Earth.

226
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,442
An ecosystem
as vast as any ocean,

227
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:12,025
right beneath our feet.

228
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,400
This energy signal
is enormous.

229
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:21,900
And almost identical
to readings from <i>Gojira.</i>

230
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:24,233
As our sun
fuels the planet's surface,

231
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,608
this energy sustains
the Hollow Earth,

232
00:16:26,692 --> 00:16:31,400
enabling life as powerful as
our aggressive Titan friend.

233
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:34,442
If we can harness
this life force,

234
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:38,108
we'll have a weapon that can
compete with Godzilla.

235
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:40,358
I need your help to find it.

236
00:16:42,817 --> 00:16:46,108
I don't know if I'm
the right guy for the job.

237
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,483
Did you read the reviews?

238
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:51,525
"A sci-fi quack
trading in fringe physics."

239
00:16:51,608 --> 00:16:53,150
Look where they put my office.

240
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:56,567
I'm in the basement
right across from flute class.

241
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,358
Besides, I'm not
with Monarch anymore.

242
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:01,775
And Hollow Earth entry
is impossible.

243
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:03,817
We tried.

244
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,858
I'm sorry about your brother.

245
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:11,858
He was a true pioneer.

246
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:13,025
Thanks.

247
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:19,900
See, all of our forward scans

248
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:23,275
suggest a habitable
environment down there.

249
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:29,025
So, what really went wrong
on your brother's mission?

250
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:34,525
When they tried to enter,

251
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:37,233
they hit
a gravitational inversion.

252
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:39,608
A whole planet's worth
of gravity

253
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,817
reversed in a split second.

254
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,567
They were crushed
in an instant.

255
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,900
What if I told you
that we, at Apex,

256
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:54,067
have created
a phenomenal craft

257
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,775
which could sustain
such an inversion?

258
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:02,025
The Hollow Earth
Aerial Vehicle.

259
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:03,817
HEAV.

260
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,942
We can make the journey

261
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:10,317
to Hollow Earth possible,
Dr. Lind.

262
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,942
But we need you
to lead the mission.

263
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:20,817
Help me.

264
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:24,775
Help everyone.

265
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:27,275
Finding this needle
in a haystack

266
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:29,608
is our best shot
against Godzilla.

267
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:33,483
Well, I, uh,
might have an idea.

268
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:35,442
But it's crazy.

269
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:39,150
I love crazy ideas.
They made me rich.

270
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,150
Are you guys familiar
with genetic memory?

271
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:46,025
It's a theory that all Titans
share a common impulse

272
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:48,150
to return
to their evolutionary source.

273
00:18:48,233 --> 00:18:49,567
Like spawning salmon.

274
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,858
Exactly. Or a...
Or a homing pigeon.

275
00:18:53,942 --> 00:18:56,150
So if this is the Titans' home

276
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:58,358
and this life force
sustains them...

277
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:00,275
A Titan
could show you the way.

278
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:03,942
Yeah.

279
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:06,067
With a little help
of an old colleague.

280
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:41,858
Ugh, where is it?

281
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:44,942
<i>Dr. Andrews, you have
a visitor waiting for you at security.</i>

282
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:52,858
Okay.

283
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:09,692
A power source
in Hollow Earth?

284
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,983
This sounds nuts, Nathan,
even for you.

285
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:14,983
It's there! We just
need Kong to bring us to it!

286
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:17,567
The second you take
Kong out of containment,

287
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,108
Godzilla's gonna come for him.

288
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:20,650
You said you can't
keep him here forever.

289
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:22,692
No. Our meddling
has already wreaked havoc

290
00:20:22,775 --> 00:20:23,900
on Kong's habitat.

291
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:25,400
No way am I
letting you drag him

292
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:27,108
halfway across the world
to use him as a weapon.

293
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,567
No, not as a weapon.
As an ally.

294
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,733
To protect us,
lead the way down there.

295
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:33,983
What even makes you think
that he'll go in?

296
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,775
You always believed
that Skull Island

297
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:38,275
was like Hollow Earth
come to the surface, right?

298
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:40,108
And that's where Kong's
ancestors came from.

299
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:41,317
Mm-hmm.

300
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,525
Through the entrance
in Antarctica,

301
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,650
we could help him
find a new home.

302
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:46,650
And he could save ours.

303
00:20:47,483 --> 00:20:48,858
Hers.

304
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:51,400
That power source
may be our only hope.

305
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,483
We gotta stop Godzilla.
This is our only chance.

306
00:20:55,275 --> 00:20:56,900
We have to take it.

307
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:15,567
- Okay.
- Yes!

308
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,775
But when it comes to Kong,
what I say goes.

309
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:21,025
You name the terms. Thank you.

310
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,983
Sorry. Thank you.

311
00:21:26,192 --> 00:21:27,608
You won't regret this.

312
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:29,900
Mm, I already regret this.

313
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:51,567
Come on.

314
00:22:49,233 --> 00:22:52,650
Whoo! Jeez,
I can smell him from up here.

315
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:54,692
Well, he can smell you, too.

316
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,650
Still not a fan, huh?

317
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:11,650
What's she saying?

318
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,233
Just an Iwi expression.

319
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:15,900
It means
that you're very brave.

320
00:23:15,983 --> 00:23:17,150
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

321
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:21,650
Hey, use a light touch
on the sedatives.

322
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,192
He's our escort.

323
00:23:23,275 --> 00:23:25,483
We can't have him comatose
when we reach Hollow Earth.

324
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:27,567
What if Kong
doesn't go willingly?

325
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,400
What do you do then?

326
00:23:29,483 --> 00:23:30,900
<i>Dr. Lind, please report</i>

327
00:23:30,983 --> 00:23:32,983
<i>to the forward deck. Dr. Lind.</i>

328
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:34,192
Excuse me.

329
00:23:35,775 --> 00:23:37,067
New arrivals.

330
00:24:00,317 --> 00:24:01,400
Welcome.

331
00:24:03,983 --> 00:24:08,942
Wow. Who's the idiot
who came up with this idea?

332
00:24:09,025 --> 00:24:10,775
- Ha-ha.
- I'm Maia Simmons.

333
00:24:10,858 --> 00:24:11,900
My father sent me.

334
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,442
I run point for Apex.

335
00:24:13,525 --> 00:24:15,233
Nathan Lind, mission chief.

336
00:24:17,692 --> 00:24:20,775
Yeah, don't worry.
I'm just here to babysit.

337
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:23,817
The Hollow Earth
Aerial Vehicles

338
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,150
are on their way to Antarctica
as we speak.

339
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:28,608
I know you people
think you're cutting-edge,

340
00:24:28,692 --> 00:24:30,317
but these prototypes
we're loaning you

341
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,858
will make what you've been
flying look like used Miatas.

342
00:24:33,942 --> 00:24:35,442
I love Miatas.

343
00:24:35,525 --> 00:24:37,650
Forget about the price tag,
which is obscene, of course.

344
00:24:37,733 --> 00:24:39,442
The antigravity engines
alone produce

345
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:41,942
enough charge
to light up Vegas for a week.

346
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,150
Feel free to be impressed.

347
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,233
Wow.

348
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:01,317
All right, we'll be

349
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,358
at the Antarctica entry
in 48 hours.

350
00:25:03,442 --> 00:25:06,525
This path will get us
into Hollow Earth.

351
00:25:06,608 --> 00:25:10,317
Once we're inside, Kong should
lead us to the power source.

352
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,858
Now, the gravitational
inversion

353
00:25:11,942 --> 00:25:13,358
will be quite intense.

354
00:25:13,442 --> 00:25:14,817
Our best guess
is that on entry,

355
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,900
it'll feel like
bungee jumping...

356
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:19,150
with the cord tied
to your lower intestine.

357
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:21,567
But if your helicopters
are as good as you say...

358
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,858
HEAVs.

359
00:25:22,942 --> 00:25:25,483
If your HEAVs are as good
as you say they are,

360
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:27,192
I believe we can do this.

361
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,775
They'll do the job.

362
00:25:29,483 --> 00:25:31,525
You just gotta do yours.

363
00:25:31,608 --> 00:25:32,983
Excellent.

364
00:25:35,275 --> 00:25:37,025
Dr. Andrews.

365
00:25:37,108 --> 00:25:39,900
We've avoided all of Godzilla's
known territorial waters

366
00:25:39,983 --> 00:25:41,692
according to your guidelines.

367
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:42,692
Good.

368
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,108
Do I need to be concerned?

369
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,025
Yes. They do have a way
of sensing threats.

370
00:25:46,108 --> 00:25:48,567
And we believe that they had
an ancient rivalry.

371
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,192
The myths say
that their ancestors

372
00:25:50,275 --> 00:25:51,733
fought each other
in a great war.

373
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:54,900
So if they meet again,
who bows to who, is that it?

374
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,025
No, I spent 10 years
on that island studying him.

375
00:25:59,108 --> 00:26:01,233
I know this for sure.

376
00:26:01,317 --> 00:26:03,608
Kong bows to no one.

377
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:53,442
Is she supposed
to be out there?

378
00:27:58,858 --> 00:28:00,525
Jia, come on. Come on.

379
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,108
Did the monkey just talk?

380
00:29:03,025 --> 00:29:05,233
<i>Okay, class, listen up.</i>

381
00:29:05,317 --> 00:29:08,900
<i>In the midst of Godzilla's
attack on Apex Pensacola,</i>

382
00:29:08,983 --> 00:29:12,775
<i>I found some crazy tech with
no official classification.</i>

383
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,067
<i>What I saw doesn't match</i>

384
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,858
<i>any of the engineering specs
I've ever seen.</i>

385
00:29:16,942 --> 00:29:20,317
<i>So what are they working on
in such blackout secrecy, hmm?</i>

386
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,025
<i>This could be the thread
that finally unravels</i>

387
00:29:22,108 --> 00:29:23,733
<i>the Apex sweater
of conspiracy.</i>

388
00:29:23,817 --> 00:29:26,525
<i>You better believe
I'm gonna keep tugging.</i>

389
00:29:26,608 --> 00:29:27,942
<i>For now, I'm secure.</i>

390
00:29:28,025 --> 00:29:29,442
<i>Anonymous
and hiding in plain sight</i>

391
00:29:29,525 --> 00:29:31,108
<i>as I continue my mission.</i>

392
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,650
To be clear, my brother can
never know we took his van.

393
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:51,108
Josh, to be clear, even if
we got into an accident,

394
00:29:51,192 --> 00:29:52,650
I don't think he could tell.

395
00:29:52,733 --> 00:29:54,525
No, no, my brother would never
let you drive either.

396
00:29:54,608 --> 00:29:55,733
My mission, my wheel.

397
00:29:55,817 --> 00:29:57,233
I just don't think
it's a good idea,

398
00:29:57,317 --> 00:29:59,108
looking for some secret weirdo
off the Internet.

399
00:29:59,192 --> 00:30:01,483
I mean, we just had
an assembly about this.

400
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:03,900
He's not a weirdo.
He's a covert investigator.

401
00:30:03,983 --> 00:30:05,900
And he's the only one
looking for the truth

402
00:30:05,983 --> 00:30:07,442
about Godzilla and Apex.

403
00:30:07,525 --> 00:30:10,150
So let him look.
Why do we have to help him?

404
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:11,483
Because...

405
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:13,733
If we don't, nobody else will.

406
00:30:15,275 --> 00:30:17,358
Are you coming or not?

407
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:18,858
Obviously I'm coming.

408
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:21,733
It's stuck.

409
00:30:21,817 --> 00:30:24,233
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

410
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,442
<i>Mind control.
Read up on it, sheep.</i>

411
00:30:36,525 --> 00:30:38,150
<i>Psionic link technology
is a reality.</i>

412
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:40,400
<i>That's right.
One brain controlling another.</i>

413
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:41,775
Oh, man.

414
00:30:41,858 --> 00:30:42,858
<i>Imagine that
on a global scale</i>

415
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:44,233
<i>and Apex is invincible.</i>

416
00:30:44,317 --> 00:30:46,025
We've been listening
to this weirdo for hours.

417
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:47,942
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

418
00:30:48,025 --> 00:30:50,108
Whoa! Knock it off!

419
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:52,025
Wait, this is the part
I was telling you about.

420
00:30:52,108 --> 00:30:54,067
<i>...need special UV to
even know you've been marked!</i>

421
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,733
<i>One or two gallons
won't cut it.</i>

422
00:30:55,817 --> 00:30:58,525
<i>I need my bleach in bulk!</i>

423
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:00,650
<i>Because spy dust
is real, people!</i>

424
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,358
<i>I mean, come on,
invisible to the naked eye...</i>

425
00:31:02,442 --> 00:31:04,067
That's how we find him.

426
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,067
- The bleach.
- Bleach?

427
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,067
He consumes a ton of bleach.

428
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,608
He drinks bleach?

429
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,025
Showers with it.

430
00:31:12,108 --> 00:31:14,900
Oh! Yeah, I shower
with bleach. No, what?

431
00:31:14,983 --> 00:31:17,858
Prevention against
organic tracking technology.

432
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,358
See? Tradecraft.

433
00:31:20,442 --> 00:31:23,025
Would've made more sense
if he just drank it.

434
00:31:28,692 --> 00:31:30,567
Come on,
just one more place.

435
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:33,150
Madison, this is getting old.

436
00:31:33,233 --> 00:31:35,525
Hey, you sell bleach?

437
00:31:35,608 --> 00:31:37,733
Is this another one of those
Internet challenge things?

438
00:31:37,817 --> 00:31:39,525
When I sold those kids
those detergent pods,

439
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:41,233
I didn't know
they were gonna eat them.

440
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:43,567
I'm still dealing
with the lawsuits from that.

441
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,983
Look, we're looking for a guy

442
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:46,567
who works
for Apex Cybernetics.

443
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,483
Buys a lot of bleach.
Like every night.

444
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:50,942
He's probably paranoid,

445
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:53,233
high-strung,
doesn't like daylight.

446
00:31:53,317 --> 00:31:55,358
You know, has a lot of crumbs
in his beard,

447
00:31:55,442 --> 00:31:56,567
if he has a beard.

448
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,192
Okay, look,
you kids want some candy?

449
00:31:58,275 --> 00:31:59,942
Because I can help you
with candy.

450
00:32:00,025 --> 00:32:03,275
Look at me in the eye. Okay?
I need information.

451
00:32:03,358 --> 00:32:04,775
Yeah, we want lots of candy.

452
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:08,150
What are you doing?
You think...?

453
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:11,525
Oh, you mean Bernie.

454
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:13,525
Yeah, I know that guy.

455
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:15,150
He buys,
like, a ton of bleach.

456
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,650
I know where he is, too.

457
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:18,942
If you buy a live fish,
I'll give you his address.

458
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:23,650
Bernie?

459
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,275
Mister...
Mis...

460
00:32:26,692 --> 00:32:28,025
Mister Bernie not home.

461
00:32:28,108 --> 00:32:29,400
Yep, that was
definitely Mister Bernie.

462
00:32:29,483 --> 00:32:30,900
Yeah. Um...

463
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:35,275
Hi! Hi. Listen, we wanna talk
about Apex and Godzilla.

464
00:32:35,358 --> 00:32:37,400
No. No. No.

465
00:32:37,483 --> 00:32:41,275
I... I got your faces.
I contact authorities. Yes.

466
00:32:41,358 --> 00:32:42,483
For knocking on a door?

467
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:43,775
No. No.

468
00:32:43,858 --> 00:32:45,942
Bernie, you don't trust
the authorities.

469
00:32:46,025 --> 00:32:47,942
My name is Madison Russell.

470
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:50,983
My father works for Monarch
and my mother was...

471
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:53,192
Emma Russell, right?

472
00:32:54,817 --> 00:32:57,900
<i>Before we go any farther,
I got one question.</i>

473
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:00,192
Tap or no tap?

474
00:33:00,275 --> 00:33:01,817
No tap.

475
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,233
- Excuse me, what is "tap"?
- Water.

476
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:06,525
They put fluoride in it.
Learned it from the Nazis.

477
00:33:06,608 --> 00:33:09,358
Theory is it makes you docile,
easy to manipulate.

478
00:33:09,442 --> 00:33:11,067
Oh, I drink tap water.

479
00:33:11,983 --> 00:33:13,442
Yeah, I kind of figured that.

480
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,025
But she does the thinking
for both of you,

481
00:33:15,108 --> 00:33:16,983
so it should be all right.

482
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:18,900
- Thanks.
- Okay.

483
00:33:18,983 --> 00:33:20,108
What you got?

484
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,442
I believe Godzilla's
most recent attacks

485
00:33:23,525 --> 00:33:24,775
haven't just been random.

486
00:33:24,858 --> 00:33:26,775
I think he targeted
the Apex facility.

487
00:33:26,858 --> 00:33:28,317
I'm of the same opinion.

488
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,733
But why? What is Apex up to
that's provoking him?

489
00:33:30,817 --> 00:33:33,358
For five years, I embedded
myself inside this company,

490
00:33:33,442 --> 00:33:35,525
trying to figure out
what their game was.

491
00:33:35,608 --> 00:33:38,108
Then, last week...

492
00:33:38,192 --> 00:33:39,317
I saw this.

493
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,692
A manifest of huge cargo
being sent from here

494
00:33:43,775 --> 00:33:45,192
to Apex headquarters
in Hong Kong,

495
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:46,650
which makes no sense

496
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,567
because we are not equipped
for heavy shipping.

497
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,900
- Then what?
- And then boom!

498
00:33:49,983 --> 00:33:51,692
Godzilla shows up.

499
00:33:51,775 --> 00:33:53,192
Caved in half the facility,

500
00:33:53,275 --> 00:33:55,025
but I got a sneak peek
at some suspicious tech

501
00:33:55,108 --> 00:33:56,692
which was hidden
in a secret bunker.

502
00:33:56,775 --> 00:33:58,733
I mean, some pretty
damn suspicious tech.

503
00:33:58,817 --> 00:34:01,025
Yeah, but what is that?

504
00:34:04,983 --> 00:34:06,358
That's, um...

505
00:34:07,817 --> 00:34:10,150
That's Katzunari
single malt whiskey.

506
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:12,525
Yeah, but it's
in a gun holster.

507
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,608
It was a gift from my Sara.

508
00:34:14,692 --> 00:34:15,775
You have a Sara?

509
00:34:15,858 --> 00:34:17,400
She was my wife.

510
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:19,567
Um, she passed on.

511
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,775
She was my rock.

512
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:27,192
My truth.

513
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:30,317
I'll tell you something,
the day that this goes empty,

514
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,358
that's the day
you know I've given up.

515
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:39,192
Bernie.

516
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:41,067
I think we can
help each other.

517
00:34:44,942 --> 00:34:47,442
Okay, I guess
now that we're a team,

518
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:49,900
I feel like we should
come up with a plan.

519
00:34:49,983 --> 00:34:51,275
We're breaking into Apex.

520
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:53,483
- Wait, what?
- You heard her.

521
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:55,275
Tap water.

522
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:56,817
Shit.

523
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:27,983
Hey.

524
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:10,317
Thank you.

525
00:36:11,817 --> 00:36:13,275
How is she?

526
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:16,358
Calm. So calm, it's scary.

527
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:18,525
That was extraordinary.

528
00:36:18,608 --> 00:36:22,358
I have been signing
the alphabet. Basic commands.

529
00:36:22,442 --> 00:36:24,983
I thought that he showed
recognition, but he never...

530
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:27,983
Do you have any idea how long
they've been communicating?

531
00:36:28,067 --> 00:36:29,358
No.

532
00:36:29,442 --> 00:36:31,567
I knew that they had a bond.

533
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,108
He trusts her.

534
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:35,400
Without her, he'd be
tearing the ship apart.

535
00:36:36,942 --> 00:36:40,192
You know, Jia's parents
were killed on the island.

536
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:42,400
When the storm
took over the island,

537
00:36:42,483 --> 00:36:44,233
it wiped out
the native people.

538
00:36:44,317 --> 00:36:45,692
But Kong saved her.

539
00:36:45,775 --> 00:36:47,858
She had nowhere to go.

540
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:49,358
So I made a promise,

541
00:36:49,442 --> 00:36:51,942
then and there,
to protect her.

542
00:36:52,025 --> 00:36:56,192
And I think that in some way,
he did the same.

543
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,400
Do you think he would take
directions from her?

544
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:04,983
No.

545
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:06,733
If we have someone who can
keep the reins on Kong...

546
00:37:06,817 --> 00:37:09,025
Yeah, no one can keep
the reins on Kong.

547
00:37:10,442 --> 00:37:12,108
And she's a child.

548
00:37:40,108 --> 00:37:43,442
I know
Jia is only a child.

549
00:37:43,525 --> 00:37:47,442
But she's the only one
he'll communicate with.

550
00:37:47,525 --> 00:37:50,567
<i>And we need Kong
to find that power source.</i>

551
00:37:52,192 --> 00:37:54,275
The world needs him.

552
00:38:07,317 --> 00:38:08,983
What's she saying?

553
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:10,192
Godzilla.

554
00:38:19,817 --> 00:38:21,150
Did we change course?

555
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:23,025
No. We're nowhere near
the areas you flagged.

556
00:38:23,108 --> 00:38:25,025
It looks like
he's coming for us anyway.

557
00:38:25,108 --> 00:38:26,317
He's not coming for us.

558
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,692
Him? Then dump him.
Dump the monkey!

559
00:38:28,775 --> 00:38:30,983
How about we throw you off
instead, huh?

560
00:38:32,983 --> 00:38:34,150
We have to release him.

561
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:35,733
If we lose Kong,
the mission is over.

562
00:38:35,817 --> 00:38:37,108
He's a sitting duck out there.

563
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:39,150
We have to let him
protect himself. And us.

564
00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:35,067
Oh, my God, Jia!

565
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,275
Nathan?

566
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,692
He needs our help.

567
00:44:29,775 --> 00:44:31,817
There must be some way
to disorient Godzilla.

568
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,525
Depth charges.

569
00:45:44,483 --> 00:45:45,942
He's circling back.

570
00:45:46,025 --> 00:45:49,108
This won't end
until one of them submits.

571
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:53,650
- Shut it down.
- What?

572
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:55,483
All of it.

573
00:45:55,567 --> 00:45:57,275
Guns, engines.

574
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:00,317
- Shut it down. Right now.
- If we do that, we're dead.

575
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,108
No, we're playing dead.

576
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,067
And we're making him think
that he's won.

577
00:46:07,983 --> 00:46:10,442
Cut the power.
Cut the engines.

578
00:46:10,525 --> 00:46:11,858
<i>Kill anything
that makes a noise.</i>

579
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,608
This better work.

580
00:47:18,317 --> 00:47:21,150
As soon as we move,
he'll be back.

581
00:47:21,233 --> 00:47:23,900
How are we supposed
to get the rest of the way?

582
00:47:30,525 --> 00:47:32,692
How's Kong with heights?

583
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:44,358
So, what's the plan?

584
00:47:44,442 --> 00:47:47,067
We find out
what's on Sublevel 33.

585
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:48,317
Ow.

586
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,233
Keep it moving, tap water.

587
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,650
Go ahead.

588
00:48:02,983 --> 00:48:06,275
All right, Mad Hatter.
Down the rabbit hole.

589
00:48:07,608 --> 00:48:09,483
Okay. We got this.

590
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:11,400
Oh, my God!

591
00:48:11,483 --> 00:48:12,567
Are you sure
we can trust this guy?

592
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:14,067
Yeah, why?

593
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:15,733
Well, mainly because he says
crazy shit all the time

594
00:48:15,817 --> 00:48:17,108
and carries
a bottle of whiskey

595
00:48:17,192 --> 00:48:19,192
from his dead wife like a gun.

596
00:48:19,275 --> 00:48:20,942
I think it's romantic.

597
00:48:21,025 --> 00:48:22,108
Whoo-hoo!

598
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,275
I really don't
understand women.

599
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:44,150
Okay, come on.

600
00:48:50,192 --> 00:48:53,150
This whole thing came
down, and there was this...

601
00:48:54,025 --> 00:48:55,858
eye.

602
00:48:55,942 --> 00:48:57,900
Uh, what are
we looking at?

603
00:48:57,983 --> 00:49:00,400
No, no, no, no.
No, it was here.

604
00:49:00,483 --> 00:49:03,275
I swear to God, it was...
it was right there.

605
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:04,942
Hey, guys.

606
00:49:07,692 --> 00:49:09,900
Anyone know
where this leads to?

607
00:49:11,233 --> 00:49:12,483
You believe me, right?

608
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:14,025
'Cause I know that
there was something here.

609
00:49:14,108 --> 00:49:16,942
I'm gonna get a migraine
from that torch.

610
00:49:17,025 --> 00:49:20,442
"Sublevel." How deep
does this thing go, Bernie?

611
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:23,733
Hell. Goes to hell.

612
00:49:23,817 --> 00:49:25,692

Whoa.

616

What is all this?

617
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:45,483
It's breakaway civilization.

618
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:46,983
I mean, come on.
This is page one

619
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,817
in the Apex-playing-God
handbook. Huh?

620
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,025
I mean, the Illuminati
running shadow economies

621
00:49:53,108 --> 00:49:55,358
all to fund a hidden colony
for the elite

622

in case any
of these governments

623
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,483
and megacorporations

624
00:49:58,567 --> 00:50:00,733
accidentally hit
the doomsday button.

625
00:50:01,942 --> 00:50:03,108
It makes sense

626
00:50:03,192 --> 00:50:04,150
- if you think about it.
- Yeah, sure.

627
00:50:06,733 --> 00:50:07,900
- Someone's coming.
- What?

628
00:50:07,983 --> 00:50:09,275
- Someone's coming.
- What?

629
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:10,942
- Someone's coming?
- Yes!

630
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,900
Oh, my God.

631
00:50:21,108 --> 00:50:24,358
- They look like eggs.
- Skull-crawlers.

632
00:50:24,442 --> 00:50:26,858
What's Apex doing
with skull-crawlers?

633
00:50:26,942 --> 00:50:28,233
All right,
let's load it up!

634
00:50:29,692 --> 00:50:31,108
What was that?
What was that?

635
00:50:31,192 --> 00:50:33,150
No way. No, no, no. Come on.

636
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:35,275
Okay, guys,
I think we're moving.

637
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:53,650
It says we're headed

638
00:50:53,733 --> 00:50:55,192
to Apex headquarters
in Hong Kong.

639
00:50:55,275 --> 00:50:56,733
- What?
- Hong Kong.

640
00:50:56,817 --> 00:50:59,025
That means that we're gonna
get some answers.

641
00:50:59,108 --> 00:51:01,317

It's not working.

645
00:53:58,983 --> 00:54:00,733
Just wait. Wait, wait, wait.

646
00:54:00,817 --> 00:54:01,942
What if she tells him

647
00:54:02,025 --> 00:54:03,900
there are others
down there like him?

648
00:54:04,817 --> 00:54:06,067
But you don't know that.

649
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:08,733
We lost our entire fleet
getting here.

650
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:11,733
There's no way back for him.

651
00:54:11,817 --> 00:54:13,900
And he can't survive here.

652
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:29,233
All right. All right.

653
00:54:36,025 --> 00:54:37,233
Hey.

654
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:24,108

Everybody to their station.

1,000 miles in two seconds

and spits us into free fall.

Well, if there's a corporate-friendly
term for "sacrifice pit,"

699
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:24,025
I'd say we are in it.

01:04:38,858 --> 01:04:41,067

01:04:57,775 --> 01:05:01,275
Mr. Simmons,

01:05:25,942 --> 01:05:27,650
Commence uplink.

708
01:05:30,483 --> 01:05:32,233
Engaging uplink.

01:05:32,317 --> 01:05:34,567
<i>Pilot engaged.</i>

710
01:06:05,567 --> 01:06:07,608
That's robot Godzilla.

711
01:06:07,692 --> 01:06:09,358
Oh, no. That's...

712
01:06:09,442 --> 01:06:11,317
That's Mechagodzilla.

713
01:06:30,067 --> 01:06:32,358
Release number 10.

714
01:06:39,567 --> 01:06:42,108
Go, go!
Go through there!

715
01:06:48,942 --> 01:06:51,192
Madison! Run, girl!

716
01:07:18,983 --> 01:07:20,108
Yes!

717
01:07:30,358 --> 01:07:32,400
Damn it.

718
01:07:32,483 --> 01:07:35,067
<i>System only reached 40% power.</i>

719
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:36,233
Oh, I know.

720
01:07:36,317 --> 01:07:37,567
As expected.

721
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:39,150
<i>Don't worry.
Once the Hollow Earth</i>

01:07:39,233 --> 01:07:40,817
<i>sample is uploaded,</i>

723
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,025
our power troubles
will be over.

724
01:07:43,108 --> 01:07:44,942

the source.

01:07:45,025 --> 01:07:49,067
<i>Oh, they'll find it.
I have faith in my daughter.</i>

726
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:51,400
I have faith in our creation.

727
01:07:51,483 --> 01:07:54,442
And humanity
will once again...

728
01:07:54,525 --> 01:07:57,858
be the apex species.

729
01:07:57,942 --> 01:08:01,900
This is why Godzilla attacked
the Apex facility.

730
01:08:01,983 --> 01:08:04,983
They're trying
to replace him.

731
01:08:30,317 --> 01:08:32,442
Come on, Maddie.

732
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,317
<i>Sir,
Godzilla just made an abrupt change</i>

733
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,025
<i>in direction.
He's moving very fast.</i>

734
01:08:38,108 --> 01:08:40,442
<i>Projections show he's likely
headed to Hong Kong.</i>

735
01:08:40,525 --> 01:08:43,483
<i>Transport is ready and waiting
to take you there, sir.</i>

736
01:09:04,692 --> 01:09:05,942
That has to be it.

737
01:11:06,192 --> 01:11:07,983
We were right.

738
01:11:09,025 --> 01:11:10,442
He's home.

739
01:12:34,108 --> 01:12:35,858
<i>All personnel must display</i>

740
01:12:35,942 --> 01:12:38,817
<i>their Apex employee badge

741
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,983
Follow me.

742
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:42,775
Lizard people
build all their facilities

743
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,858
the same way.
I can find the exit.

744
01:12:46,983 --> 01:12:49,025
The exit's this way.

745
01:12:49,108 --> 01:12:51,233
Guys. Madison!

746
01:13:01,025 --> 01:13:02,858
Oh, my God.

747
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:07,567
Bitch, what?

748
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:09,108
It's a Titan skull.

749
01:13:09,192 --> 01:13:12,400
No, no, no.
That's not just any Titan.

750
01:13:12,483 --> 01:13:13,983
That's Monster Zero.

751
01:13:14,067 --> 01:13:16,442
Ghidorah.

752
01:13:20,817 --> 01:13:22,733
They hardwired its DNA.

753
01:13:22,817 --> 01:13:24,817
Self-generating
neural pathways

754
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,025
capable of intuitive learning.

755
01:13:27,108 --> 01:13:29,192
Okay, I'm smart,
but I only go to high school.

756
01:13:29,275 --> 01:13:31,567
- It's a living supercomputer.
- Shh.

757
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:36,942
It had three heads.

758
01:13:37,025 --> 01:13:38,233
Its necks were so long,

759
01:13:38,317 --> 01:13:40,567
they communicated
telepathically.

760
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:42,025
And there's one here

761
01:13:42,108 --> 01:13:43,983
and another one
inside of that thing.

762
01:13:44,067 --> 01:13:46,483
Yeah, it could be
a psionic interface.

763
01:13:47,192 --> 01:13:48,942
Oh, my God.

764
01:13:50,525 --> 01:13:51,733
Careful.

765
01:13:51,817 --> 01:13:52,900
It's a pilot.

766
01:13:52,983 --> 01:13:56,233
Yeah.
He's in a trance.

767
01:13:56,317 --> 01:13:58,192
That's a psionic uplink.

768
01:13:59,358 --> 01:14:01,775
It follows his will.

769
01:14:01,858 --> 01:14:04,233
Oh, Apex, what have you done?

770
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:50,025
This is the day we feared.
I've given the order, Doctor.

771
01:14:50,108 --> 01:14:51,858
<i>The city is being evacuated.</i>

772
01:15:00,025 --> 01:15:03,483
I don't understand.
He led us here. Where is it?

773
01:15:23,442 --> 01:15:24,775
What is he doing?

774
01:15:54,442 --> 01:15:55,858
It's the axe.

775
01:15:55,942 --> 01:15:57,858
It's drawing radiation
from the core

776
01:15:57,942 --> 01:15:59,442
like it's charging.

777
01:16:41,317 --> 01:16:45,025
Whoa! Godzilla's
responding! They found it!

778
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:50,525
What in the hell?

779
01:17:04,192 --> 01:17:05,817
What are you doing?

780
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,650
Extracting a sample.

781
01:17:07,733 --> 01:17:09,942
This is a power
beyond our understanding.

782
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:11,608
You can't just drill into it.

783
01:17:11,692 --> 01:17:13,608
Actually, we can.

784
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,442
My father gets what he wants.

785
01:17:18,525 --> 01:17:20,192
That's Apex property now.

786
01:17:20,275 --> 01:17:21,483
What?

787
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:29,650
Energy signature incoming.

788
01:17:29,733 --> 01:17:32,775
We should be able
to recreate it soon.

789
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:37,942
That is the discovery
of the millennium.

790
01:17:38,025 --> 01:17:40,650
- You can't strip it for parts.
- Hold it.

791
01:18:06,442 --> 01:18:08,525
Go. Go. Got what we needed.

792
01:18:08,608 --> 01:18:10,192
Let's go!

793
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,108
Yes.

794
01:18:13,192 --> 01:18:16,692
Mr. Serizawa,
start your engines!

795
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:18,025
The upgrade is untested.

796
01:18:18,108 --> 01:18:19,567
Once we get online,

797
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:21,317
<i>Gojira</i> will come
straight for us.

798
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:22,983
He's been coming for us

799
01:18:23,067 --> 01:18:25,025
since our creation
first awoke.

800
01:18:25,108 --> 01:18:27,442
- We must embrace it.
- We shouldn't rush this.

801
01:18:27,525 --> 01:18:29,650
We have no idea
how this energy source

802
01:18:29,733 --> 01:18:30,775
will affect the Mecha.

803
01:18:30,858 --> 01:18:32,692
Get in the goddamn chair.

804
01:18:47,817 --> 01:18:50,525
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, come on!

805
01:18:50,608 --> 01:18:53,150
Move! What are you
waiting for? Let's go!

806
01:18:59,483 --> 01:19:02,317
This way, sir! Hurry!
We gotta get back...

807
01:19:28,983 --> 01:19:30,733
Okay.

808
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:09,025
Get him out of the way!
Shoot him!

809
01:20:11,275 --> 01:20:12,858
Go, go, go!

810
01:20:21,858 --> 01:20:23,025
Oh, no.

811
01:20:23,692 --> 01:20:24,983
No, no, no...

812
01:20:27,733 --> 01:20:30,358
Oh, Jesus!
Come on, let's go!

813
01:20:58,942 --> 01:21:00,317
- Hold on, ladies.
- Yeah.

814
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:02,275
Whoa.

815
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,817
Stay low.

816
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:36,900
Yeah. Going viral.

817
01:21:37,608 --> 01:21:38,692
What?

818
01:21:38,775 --> 01:21:41,400
We've gotta try and stop this.

819
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:45,608
Mm-mm. I don't like this, guys.

820
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:47,650
If this wasn't contributing
to world destruction,

821
01:21:47,733 --> 01:21:49,317
this would be
a great DJ booth.

822
01:21:53,483 --> 01:21:54,817
I know what it... Maintenance.

823
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,483
Madison, we should go.

824
01:21:56,567 --> 01:21:58,192
I'm Maintenance.
You don't have to alert the...

825
01:21:58,275 --> 01:21:59,900
She doesn't buy that.
Uh, Madison, we need to go.

826
01:21:59,983 --> 01:22:01,900
The woman
with the villain hairdo...

827
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:03,442
Madison, they have guns.

828
01:22:03,525 --> 01:22:06,233
Hey, guys. Uh, it's soundproof
so I can't really...

829
01:22:06,317 --> 01:22:08,317
- I wanna communicate...
- Open the door!

830
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,483
Say again?

831
01:22:09,567 --> 01:22:11,275
Oh, God!
Get down! Get down!

832
01:22:11,358 --> 01:22:13,442
Oh, shit!

833
01:24:48,275 --> 01:24:50,733
We're about to breach
the veil! Hold on!

834
01:26:01,692 --> 01:26:04,192
Looks like round two
goes to Kong.

835
01:26:16,775 --> 01:26:17,858
Hey!

836
01:26:22,942 --> 01:26:26,567
Oh, come on, guys.
Really? Greenpeace again?

837
01:26:26,650 --> 01:26:28,608
Greenpea...

838
01:26:28,692 --> 01:26:30,900
Actually, sir, not like
you would know this,

839
01:26:30,983 --> 01:26:32,817
but I'm Level Two
Assistant Engineering...

840
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:35,358
Well, Provisional Level Two
Assistant Engineering,

841
01:26:35,442 --> 01:26:36,733
not like you would know that.

842
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:38,775
My evaluations
were incredibly encourag...

843
01:26:38,858 --> 01:26:43,150
I'm just saying Greenpeace
wishes, is all I'm saying.

844
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:46,900
Where do I know you from?

845
01:26:49,483 --> 01:26:51,692
Oh, my goodness.

846
01:26:51,775 --> 01:26:54,942
Director Russell's daughter,
yes?

847
01:26:55,025 --> 01:26:56,608
You caused all of this.

848
01:26:56,692 --> 01:27:00,900
If by "all of this,"
you mean I, and I alone,

849
01:27:00,983 --> 01:27:03,567
have given humanity a chance
against the Titans,

850
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:06,567
then, yes,
I will own that title.

851
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:09,067
Godzilla had left us in peace.

852
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:10,900
You provoked him into war.

853
01:27:10,983 --> 01:27:13,733
There can only be one alpha,
Miss Russell.

854
01:27:13,817 --> 01:27:16,692
It seems to have been
providence.

855
01:30:06,358 --> 01:30:08,067
<i>It's time to launch.</i>

856
01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:10,317
<i>Begin pilot integration.</i>

857
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:19,483
And now...

858
01:30:20,567 --> 01:30:21,900
my Mecha.

859
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:25,650
<i>It's not only
Godzilla's equal...</i>

860
01:30:27,567 --> 01:30:29,317
<i>but his superior.</i>

861
01:30:31,358 --> 01:30:34,983
The Apex Titan of my own hand.

862
01:30:36,733 --> 01:30:39,733
<i>It's time to show
the world what you can do.</i>

863
01:30:42,067 --> 01:30:44,025
<i>Pilot engaged.</i>

864
01:30:47,858 --> 01:30:51,025
<i>Alert: Failure.
System unstable.</i>

865
01:30:51,108 --> 01:30:55,233
<i>Alert: Failure.
System unstable.</i>

866
01:30:57,358 --> 01:31:00,817
This is how we,
as a species, win.

867
01:31:02,108 --> 01:31:03,900
You see, 10 years ago,

868
01:31:03,983 --> 01:31:07,608
when <i>Gojira</i> was first revealed
to the world,

869
01:31:07,692 --> 01:31:09,817
I had a dream.

870
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:12,983
And in that dream,
I saw one thing.

871
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:18,817
And that beautiful,
amazing thing was...

872
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:23,067
Oh, shit.

873
01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:24,233
No!

874
01:31:37,317 --> 01:31:39,108
It's unfair.

875
01:31:39,192 --> 01:31:41,483
I really wanted to hear
the rest of that speech.

876
01:32:17,775 --> 01:32:19,400
What in God's name is that?

877
01:33:04,358 --> 01:33:06,733
It's thinking for itself now.

878
01:33:06,817 --> 01:33:08,900
We have to warn Monarch.

879
01:33:08,983 --> 01:33:11,483
Or try to stop it ourselves.

880
01:33:11,567 --> 01:33:13,275
That thing's still linked
to their satellite.

881
01:33:13,358 --> 01:33:15,358
Wait, Josh.

882
01:33:15,442 --> 01:33:17,442
If I can figure out
the password,

883
01:33:17,525 --> 01:33:19,275
maybe we can shut it down.

884
01:33:19,358 --> 01:33:20,442
All right.

885
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:35,775
What the hell is that?

886
01:34:27,567 --> 01:34:28,817
What?

887
01:34:34,650 --> 01:34:36,567
What's happening?

888
01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:38,483
She can feel his heartbeat.

889
01:34:39,108 --> 01:34:40,150
He's dying.

890
01:34:42,608 --> 01:34:44,692
There's nothing we can do
to restart his heart.

891
01:34:44,775 --> 01:34:46,192
We'd need a charge
big enough to...

892
01:34:46,275 --> 01:34:48,108
Light up Las Vegas for a week.

893
01:35:11,275 --> 01:35:12,775
Is that a password?

894
01:35:14,233 --> 01:35:15,483
Is that a password?

895
01:35:15,567 --> 01:35:16,817
I don't know!
I'm not used to this.

896
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:18,483
I'm used to pirating
movies online.

897
01:35:18,567 --> 01:35:20,067
Okay, then go to Settings.

898
01:35:20,150 --> 01:35:21,650
- <i>This is Mark.</i>
- Dad?

899
01:35:21,733 --> 01:35:23,692
Madison, where are you?

900
01:35:23,775 --> 01:35:25,942
<i>Dad, can you hear...</i>

901
01:35:26,025 --> 01:35:27,817
Can you hear me?
I'm in Hong Kong.

902
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:29,400
- <i>Mad?</i>
- Dad!

903
01:35:29,483 --> 01:35:31,317
Mad? Madison!

904
01:35:35,983 --> 01:35:37,233
A-ha!

905
01:35:40,567 --> 01:35:42,733
Okay, you two better
get some distance.

906
01:35:49,275 --> 01:35:50,567
Hey.

907
01:35:52,317 --> 01:35:55,400
You are
a very brave little girl.

908
01:36:02,942 --> 01:36:04,317
I don't know.

909
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,025
Maybe we both are.

910
01:36:44,692 --> 01:36:45,942
Okay.

911
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:51,567
Good luck, big fella.

912
01:38:26,692 --> 01:38:28,108
I thought you said
you were a hacker!

913
01:38:28,192 --> 01:38:30,067
I said I took an HTML course
at summer camp.

914
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:31,733
- HTML?
- Yes, at summer camp.

915
01:38:31,817 --> 01:38:34,192
Was it a '90s camp?
Come on. Use QWERTY.

916
01:38:34,275 --> 01:38:36,567
<i>Error. Security lock.</i>

917
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:39,067
No. Shit!

918
01:38:39,150 --> 01:38:40,567
Shit.

919
01:40:18,192 --> 01:40:19,942
Josh!
You have to do something.

920
01:40:20,025 --> 01:40:22,025
We tried to take down
those Apex bastards,

921
01:40:22,108 --> 01:40:23,525
but I think this is
as far as we go,

922
01:40:23,608 --> 01:40:24,858
so bottom's up.

923
01:40:24,942 --> 01:40:27,150
I was hoping to die
with adults, but okay.

924
01:40:32,150 --> 01:40:35,233
If you've never had a drink
before, now's the time 'cause...

925
01:40:35,317 --> 01:40:36,858
Drink. Drink!

926
01:40:36,942 --> 01:40:38,650
Hey! What are you...

927
01:40:40,442 --> 01:40:41,858
That's your solution?

928
01:40:41,942 --> 01:40:44,108
I gotta die here with you,
and sober!

929
01:41:07,817 --> 01:41:09,442
- Yeah!
- Yes! Yes!

930
01:42:02,692 --> 01:42:04,108
Hey, Nathan?

931
01:42:05,567 --> 01:42:07,483
Nathan?

932
01:42:07,567 --> 01:42:09,317
Nathan, are you okay?

933
01:42:33,275 --> 01:42:34,358
Dad?

934
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:36,983
Dad!

935
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:38,858
Dad!

936
01:42:47,150 --> 01:42:50,525
Hi. Um, it was, um...
Madison's idea.

937
01:42:51,650 --> 01:42:53,150
Shut up, Josh.

938
01:42:53,275 --> 01:42:56,983
Dad. This is the man
who saved our lives.

939
01:42:57,067 --> 01:42:58,400
Bernie, meet Dad.

940
01:42:58,483 --> 01:42:59,858
Dad. Uh, Bernie.

941
01:42:59,942 --> 01:43:01,858
Um, it's an absolute pleasure
to meet you.

942
01:43:01,942 --> 01:43:05,025
I was wondering if I
could invite you onto my podcast

943
01:43:05,108 --> 01:43:08,358
to talk about the Monarch
facility in Roswell because...

944
01:43:14,275 --> 01:43:15,608
It's amazing. It happened...

945
01:43:29,442 --> 01:43:31,067
Jia? Jia!

946
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:49,275
Heads up, guys! He's coming
around for his morning walk.

947
