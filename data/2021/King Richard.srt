00:00:56,989 --> 00:00:59,158
I'll take that. Thank you.

3
00:00:59,242 --> 00:01:02,120
<i>Where I grew up,
Louisiana, Cedar Grove,</i>

4
00:01:02,203 --> 00:01:05,039
<i>tennis was not
a game peoples played.</i>

5
00:01:05,123 --> 00:01:07,291
<i>We was too busy
running from the Klan.</i>

6
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:09,460
<i>But here it is.</i>

7
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:12,004
<i>When I'm interested
in a thing, I learn it.</i>

8
00:01:12,088 --> 00:01:13,464
<i>How it works,</i>

9
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:15,258
<i>how the best peoples
in the world do it.</i>

10
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,136
<i>And that's what I did
with tennis, with the girls.</i>

11
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:20,179
<i>If you
look at the biggest servers,</i>

12
00:01:20,263 --> 00:01:22,265
<i>Sampras, Lendl, Connors,</i>

13
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:25,476
<i>you'll see the break of
their wrist is like a smack,</i>

14
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,936
<i>like a high-five.</i>

15
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:29,272
<i>That's what you're looking for
when you hit it.</i>

16
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,648
<i>That "pop".</i>

17
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:33,693
All we need is a club
for training,

18
00:01:33,776 --> 00:01:35,361
and clinics, the whole deal.

19
00:01:35,444 --> 00:01:39,699
Everything the girls need
to go from prodigy to pro.

20
00:01:39,782 --> 00:01:42,869
I wrote me a 78-page plan
for their whole career

21
00:01:42,952 --> 00:01:44,412
before they was even born.

22
00:01:46,455 --> 00:01:49,167
It was, uh, 1977, I had
watched this tennis match

23
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,711
and I seen them get this girl,
uh, Virginia Ruzici,

24
00:01:51,794 --> 00:01:54,088
$40,000 for four days' work.

25
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:57,425
And since I knew I had
only made $52,000 all year,

26
00:01:57,508 --> 00:01:59,635
I knew I was
in the wrong business.

27
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,554
Went home that night,
told the wife,

28
00:02:01,637 --> 00:02:04,557
"We need to make
two more kids."

29
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,309
So that night
I wrote up the plan.

30
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,728
One for Venus, one for Serena.

31
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:10,438
- All right.
- Cover their whole tennis...

32
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:12,899
- Step in a little bit more.
- ...cover their education,

33
00:02:12,982 --> 00:02:15,109
foreign languages, everything.

34
00:02:15,193 --> 00:02:17,028
- And now that plan say...
- All right, short it up.

35
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:19,155
...it's time for us
to come see you

36
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:21,324
to help turn them
into champions.

37
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,951
Now, I know what you thinking.

38
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:26,204
"This family
is from the ghetto.

39
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:28,414
How they gonna pay old me?"

40
00:02:28,497 --> 00:02:29,707
Well, don't you worry
about that.

41
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,958
We're not here to rob ya.

42
00:02:31,042 --> 00:02:32,710
We here to make you rich.

43
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:34,921
You ever think
about basketball?

44
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:38,633
Best of luck to you.

45
00:02:38,716 --> 00:02:40,885
Okay, you making a mistake,
but I'mma let you make it.

46
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:42,428
- All right.
- Okay.

47
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:45,097
- Them pants look expensive.
- Oh, they are.

48
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:46,974
If I had a dollar
for every crazy parent

49
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:49,560
that told me their kid
would make it to number one,

50
00:02:49,644 --> 00:02:51,103
I'd be a rich man.

51
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:54,440
You look pretty rich to me.

52
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:55,816
Well, there you go.

53
00:02:58,402 --> 00:03:00,571
You need to open
your stance up a little more.

54
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:02,031
Your stance too closed.

55
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:26,681
Serena, those books
are bigger than you are.

56
00:03:26,764 --> 00:03:28,683
No, they're not. I can do it.
I can carry more than you.

57
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:30,142
And break your back
while you're at it?

58
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:31,143
Wanna bet?

59
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:33,062
Serena!

60
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:35,481
Oh.

61
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:36,691
Phone book.

62
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,194
Phone book.

63
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:43,823
Phone book.

64
00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:46,534
Phone book.

65
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,162
- Phone book.
- Girls.

66
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:52,331
- Hey.
- Told ya I'd win.

67
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:55,042
- Hi, Mrs. Strickland.
- Thank you.

68
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:56,377
Now, you need
to go tell your father

69
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,504
to stop working you so hard.

70
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:01,132
I seen y'all practicing
in the rain.

71
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:03,175
The man is crazy.

72
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:06,887
Girls. Y'all go ahead
back in the house.

73
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:08,848
Tell your sisters
we leaving in a few minutes.

74
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:10,266
Okay.

75
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:12,852
We'll deliver
the rest of them books later.

76
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:16,564
I ain't gonna tell you again,
do not talk to them kids.

77
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:20,026
Excuse me.
They came onto my lawn.

78
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:22,862
And somebody has gotta,
as hard as you're working 'em.

79
00:04:22,945 --> 00:04:24,530
They work as hard
as they need to

80
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:26,824
to stay off these streets.

81
00:04:26,907 --> 00:04:29,994
I'm in the champion-raising
business.

82
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:31,912
I got a book about it
about to come out soon.

83
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:34,248
Maybe I give a copy
to your daughter.

84
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:36,083
Remind me which corner
she working on again?

85
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,376
Get off my property.

86
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,753
Richard, leave
that nosy woman alone.

87
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:40,171
Yeah, just stop talking
to my kids.

88
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:41,297
Got your little
booty-hugging shorts.

89
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,715
You need some bigger shorts.

90
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:43,716
You know
she just wanna rile you up.

91
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:46,218
I gotta get to work.

92
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:49,638
I think you riling me up with
them little nurse shoes on.

93
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,265
I love them nurse shoes.

94
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:52,641
Get these girls to practice.

95
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,144
- All right. Have a good day.
- You, too.

96
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:59,357
Keep turning those hips
if you wanna get that power.

97
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,900
- Okay.
- Bye, Mom.

98
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:02,401
- Tunde, dang, you're a nerd.
- Stop.

99
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:04,070
Why you doing homework
on a Saturday?

100
00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:06,238
Because I am trying
to get an A.

101
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:08,115
You should try it
with your B-Plus.

102
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,285
Where are we practicing today,
Daddy?

103
00:05:11,369 --> 00:05:12,870
Yeah,
where are we practicing?

104
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:14,246
At the club.

105
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,207
And, Serena, stop saying
everything Venus say.

106
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,667
Hope they don't steal
our balls again.

107
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:19,919
Lyn, you probably
told 'em to do it

108
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:21,545
so we wouldn't
have to practice.

109
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:24,382
We got us
a van full of balls.

110
00:05:24,465 --> 00:05:25,674
And you don't need
to be worrying

111
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,218
about what other folks
is doing anyway.

112
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:29,387
You need to worry
about what you doing.

113
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,763
We out here getting great,

114
00:05:30,846 --> 00:05:32,264
that's what we need
to be worrying about.

115
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:33,599
You understand that?

116
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:35,267
Yes, Daddy, we do.

117
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:36,894
All right.

118
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:38,145
Oh.

119
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:40,022
Say hi to the peoples
that's gone.

120
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,858
Hi to the people
that's gone.

121
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,868
I feel like
I'm in church.

122
00:05:55,037 --> 00:05:57,623
Hey, who ready to work?
Who ready to work?

123
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:07,216
- Say again?
- We're ready, Daddy.

124
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,511
That's what I like to hear.

125
00:06:24,066 --> 00:06:25,151
Stay up on your toes.

126
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:27,111
You're making too much noise.

127
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:33,284
King Richard, don't get
much rest ever, do you?

128
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:35,953
Don't nothing come
to a sleeper but a dream.

129
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:46,964
Oh, no, watch out. Watch out.

130
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:49,633
There you go. Keep that wrist
like the smack.

131
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:51,051
It's like
with the "pop" on top.

132
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,347
Throw it to the sky.
Get this one over the fence.

133
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:57,099
I like that. Yeah, that's it.

134
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:00,519
There you go!

135
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:04,064
First drill.
Whoever hit that, one dollar.

136
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:08,110
Yes, yes, good power.

137
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:12,448
Yes, there you go.
There you go.

138
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:17,077
Yes! Ooh, watch out, Martina.

139
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:18,913
Speed that racket here though.

140
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:21,540
Oh! Almost, Venus Williams!

141
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,460
Forehand.

142
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:25,961
Yes, you keep that stance open

143
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,631
or else I'mma come down there
and tickle you.

144
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:29,882
Very good. Very good.

145
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:30,925
Get to it.
Get to it. Get to it.

146
00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:33,469
There you go. There you go.

147
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:35,971
Wait for that ball.
Go get it. Go get it. Yes.

148
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:45,105
Good depth. Good depth there.

149
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:49,443
Switch it backhand.

150
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:53,030
Don't get too excited.
This is your game.

151
00:07:53,113 --> 00:07:54,657
Get it all the way
up to that cotton picker.

152
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,493
All the way up to the sky.

153
00:07:57,576 --> 00:07:59,995
Yes, Venus Williams.
Come on in here.

154
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,623
That's a very,
very good day today.

155
00:08:02,706 --> 00:08:04,458
You did good work.

156
00:08:04,542 --> 00:08:05,918
- Venus Williams...
- Mm?

157
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:07,503
...who is your best friend?

158
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:08,754
You, Daddy.

159
00:08:08,837 --> 00:08:10,756
Serena Williams,
who is your best friend?

160
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,174
Venus. Then you.

161
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,551
- Then you. After Venus.
- That's unbelievable.

162
00:08:13,634 --> 00:08:14,927
- That is unbelievable.
- It's okay.

163
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,428
Give your daddy a kiss.

164
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:18,847
Thank you. All right.

165
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,558
Why don't y'all go ahead, uh,

166
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:23,727
and pick the balls
and everything up?

167
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:27,606
How you doing? I'm sorry,
what's your name, mama?

168
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,316
You ain't gotta act
like that, love.

169
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,986
We just trying to talk to you,
that's all.

170
00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:33,195
Tunde!

171
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,822
Pick your things up,
get your sisters,

172
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:36,115
go ahead to the bus.

173
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:37,616
You Tunde?
That's your name?

174
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,660
Hey, the homie said
he wanna talk to you.

175
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:43,539
But, Tunde, you ain't gotta
be acting like that, love.

176
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:45,457
She's studying.
Where she going?

177
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,210
Don't drop
your backpack, baby.

178
00:08:56,218 --> 00:08:58,262
Keep talking all that shit.

179
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:04,310
Oh, Tunde!

180
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:06,687
Tunde, the homie's
still right here.

181
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,903
I be tellin' this love
right here...

182
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,322
You gotta stop acting

183
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:18,824
What is he doing?

184
00:09:18,907 --> 00:09:21,869
Nigga be acting like
he scared or something like...

185
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:25,831
Young man, now
I asked you a couple times...

186
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:27,249
Young man?

187
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,669
Now, that girl there
is only 16 years old.

188
00:09:30,753 --> 00:09:32,004
And she out here to work.

189
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:34,298
Just leave her alone.

190
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:36,175
Leave her alone.

191
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:37,843
I talk to whoever I want,
homie.

192
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:39,470
Oh, he upset, nigga.

193
00:09:39,553 --> 00:09:41,513
You leave these girls
at peace.

194
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:42,848
Hey, yo, come on, homie, man.

195
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:44,350
Leave this
old-ass nigga alone.

196
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:45,768
What, now you feel like

197
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,394
you're better than us
or something, homie?

198
00:09:47,478 --> 00:09:50,147
Hey, homeboy, you know
you hear me talking to you.

199
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,861
What's up, homie, you got
something you wanna say?

200
00:09:55,944 --> 00:09:58,113
I done said what I wanna say.

201
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:01,909
Just mind your business.
She not interested in you.

202
00:10:04,787 --> 00:10:07,039
Yeah, now

203
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:09,208
Oh, damn! Come on, Roc!

204
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,210
See your daddy now,
huh, Tunde?

205
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:14,129
Come on, man.
He's an old-ass nigga, man.

206
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,882
That's your homie, man.
What's going on with him?

207
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:18,217
Come on, man.

208
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,677
Hey, keep your old ass
at home, homie.

209
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,887
Turn that music up.
Turn that music up.

210
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,431
Come over here trippin'
and shit, man.

211
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:29,561
Why you beating up
my homeboy, man?

212
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:34,566
Came over here
with that stupid shit.

213
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,527
Punk-ass niggas,
say what?

214
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:49,123
Daddy, are you okay?

215
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:53,293
When I was your age, I used to
have to fight every day.

216
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:55,713
If it wasn't the Ku Klux Klan
or the police

217
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:59,800
or the White boys
from the next town,

218
00:10:59,883 --> 00:11:04,179
somebody was always beating
on me for something.

219
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,182
And I ain't had no daddy
to stand in their way.

220
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:12,980
This world ain't never had no
respect for Richard Williams.

221
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:16,400
But they gonna respect y'all.

222
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:20,863
They gonna respect y'all.

223
00:11:41,842 --> 00:11:44,678
Somebody ought to call
the cops on you.

224
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:48,766
Daddy, what's happening?

225
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:50,976
Nothing, Junior.
Go in the house.

226
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:52,478
Okay.

227
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:54,938
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, Mom.

228
00:11:55,022 --> 00:11:56,106
Hey, Mommy.

229
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,441
Dinner's ready.
How was practice?

230
00:11:57,524 --> 00:12:00,527
- It was good.
- Daddy got beat up again.

231
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:02,071
Did you work
on your serve?

232
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,530
Yeah.

233
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:05,532
Tunde, get the plates.

234
00:12:05,616 --> 00:12:07,159
If we eat fast enough,

235
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:08,827
we'll probably have time
for the talent show.

236
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:10,496
Oh, wait, hold on.
I'm going first.

237
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:11,622
I already know
what I'm singing.

238
00:12:11,705 --> 00:12:12,998
Let me guess...

239
00:12:13,081 --> 00:12:18,420
<i>♪ Because the greatest ♪</i>

240
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:19,838
<i>♪ Love of all ♪</i>

241
00:12:19,922 --> 00:12:22,966
Stop! What's so funny?
The song is a great song.

242
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,052
- Move, move, move.
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

243
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:26,345
Leave Serena alone.

244
00:12:26,428 --> 00:12:28,430
- Here, give this out.
- Thank you, Mama.

245
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,765
Y'all go wash up.

246
00:12:37,314 --> 00:12:39,274
What happened?

247
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,277
That same boy
sniffing around Tunde.

248
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:47,115
- Gimme this.
- Thank you.

249
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,077
All right.
I got to get to work.

250
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:53,121
Okay, girls, half hour.

251
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,791
Finish your homework,
then get to bed.

252
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:57,125
- Y'all clean up.
- You got it?

253
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,627
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:02,214
Something has to change.

255
00:13:02,297 --> 00:13:05,300
- What you mean?
- We can't keep up this pace.

256
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:10,806
Me nursing all day,
you working all night.

257
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:12,182
Coaching in-between.

258
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:13,559
Now look at your face.

259
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:16,228
Look, I done already
put this behind me.

260
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:17,938
Okay, we just got to stick
to the plan.

261
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:20,274
We got champions
in the other room.

262
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:22,901
Richard, we have done
a great job with them.

263
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:24,444
They are great,

264
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:27,030
but they're not going
to Wimbledon like this.

265
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:30,534
Not with hitting with you and
me on those raggedy courts.

266
00:13:30,617 --> 00:13:33,078
They need
better surfaces that...

267
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:34,746
They need better everything.

268
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,833
And not playing with you
with your busted-up feet.

269
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:42,212
My feets are fine, okay?

270
00:13:42,296 --> 00:13:44,089
Okay, actually
they was hurting out there

271
00:13:44,172 --> 00:13:45,591
a little bit today.

272
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:52,097
Richard, you playing.
I'm serious.

273
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:54,933
I'm serious.

274
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,778
- You are right.
- I know I'm right.

275
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:07,988
Yeah.

276
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,951
You should have seen Venus
out there today.

277
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:15,954
Just something done clicked
in her mind.

278
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:18,332
- She is so ready.
- Yeah, she really is.

279
00:14:18,415 --> 00:14:20,125
She ready for that next level.

280
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:28,133
- She ready.
- You got to trust me, okay?

281
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:31,970
- All right.
- I'mma get us some help.

282
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:35,807
Venus and Serena
gonna shake up this world.

283
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:39,144
And they gonna need to

284
00:14:39,227 --> 00:14:41,021
'cause they not gonna
make it as singers.

285
00:14:42,397 --> 00:14:43,690
They not 'cause...

286
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:45,484
<i>♪ I wanna dance with somebody ♪</i>

287
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:47,069
Oh, Serena.

288
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,446
I got to get to work.
I got to get to work.

289
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:51,156
<i>♪ With somebody ♪</i>

290
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:52,991
- That's what I wanna hear.
- Mm-hmm.

291
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:55,077

292
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,913
<i>♪ Say you wanna dance

293
00:14:57,996 --> 00:14:59,498

294
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:03,418
<i>♪ Oh,

295
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,216
- A basketball.
- Dancing together. A hole...

296
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:11,677
- Ballet.
- Oh, a ring. A ring.

297
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,095
A basketball hoop.

298
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:14,721
Ten o'clock, girls.
Time for bed.

299
00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:16,223
What was it?

300
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:17,599
Saturn.

301
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:23,313
All right.
Y'all wrote in your journals?

302
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:24,773
Made your plans for tomorrow?

303
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:26,733
- Yes, Daddy.
- That's right.

304
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:28,986
Got to have a plan
for every day, else what?

305
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:31,029
You fail to plan,
you plan to fail.

306
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:32,739
That's right.
We not failing, are we?

307
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:33,782
No, Daddy.

308
00:15:33,865 --> 00:15:35,617
Okay, all the way to the top.

309
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,911
Come on, Meka.

310
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:40,330
You know,
one day not too long from now,

311
00:15:40,414 --> 00:15:44,584
somebody gonna hand you girls
a check for $1 million.

312
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:47,587
And you gonna buy
as many beds as you want.

313
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:49,006
In one check? Really?

314
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:51,508
Maybe even a couple of 'em.

315
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:54,302
But we not gonna be
like this forever, okay?

316
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:58,765
- Okay.
- All right.

317
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:02,269
- You girls go to bed.
- Good night, Daddy.

318
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:56,675
<i>As you notice, Vic,</i>

319
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:58,426
<i>they have very good form.</i>

320
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,886
<i>And, uh, you can see</i>

321
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,849
<i>their serve looks very good,
hopefully.</i>

322
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:06,184
<i>Raise your hand, Serena.</i>

323
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:07,811
<i>Venus Williams.</i>

324
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:13,483
<i>And, uh, we have your tape,</i>
Tennis Our Way,

325
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,110
<i>and we've been viewing it.</i>

326
00:18:15,193 --> 00:18:18,488
<i>However, the tape say
you'll be good by Friday.</i>

327
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:21,867
<i>Well, guess what, Vic,
we got good by Tuesday.</i>

328
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,535
<i>That's how good your tape is.</i>

329
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:26,288
<i>These girls is looking
for some coaching,</i>

330
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,831
<i>and we think you'd be great.</i>

331
00:18:27,914 --> 00:18:30,542
<i>So, you want to relax,
take it easy,</i>

332
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:34,629
<i>and get a chance to see
some real good tennis players.</i>

333
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,339
That's it.

334
00:18:36,423 --> 00:18:38,049
So I guess
you made that yourself.

335
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:39,926
Yes, I did. Yes.

336
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,428
Uh, when the girls
was younger,

337
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:43,388
I had bought me
this camcorder.

338
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:45,182
So I film myself in the mirror

339
00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:46,975
asking questions, things,
and the such.

340
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:49,477
Then when they got older,
I start doing it with them.

341
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,938
I called it
their "media training".

342
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:54,524
I see.
Well, that's very industrious.

343
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:57,736
Oh, yeah,
I'm a businessman, Vic.

344
00:18:57,819 --> 00:19:00,405
This deal you're asking for,
you know,

345
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:02,699
all of this for free, Richard,

346
00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:06,369
nobody's taking that bet.

347
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:08,747
Tennis is a technical game,

348
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,290
you know,
probably one of the most.

349
00:19:10,373 --> 00:19:15,337
And... And if you didn't
grow up with the game, then...

350
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,922
It's like playing the violin.

351
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:19,466
You know, it takes hours
and hours a day.

352
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:21,426
You know, year after year

353
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:23,762
of expensive
expert instruction,

354
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:26,264
just to hold the thing right.

355
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:27,807
Yeah, and even then,

356
00:19:27,891 --> 00:19:31,144
even for families with
unlimited financial resources,

357
00:19:31,228 --> 00:19:34,606
the chances
of achieving the kind of

358
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:38,777
mastery and success
that you're talking about...

359
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,696
I mean, for one kid,
let alone two, it's...

360
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,574
It's like asking somebody
to believe that

361
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:46,743
you got the next two Mozarts

362
00:19:46,826 --> 00:19:49,788
living in your house,
you know?

363
00:19:49,871 --> 00:19:51,164
It's just...

364
00:19:51,248 --> 00:19:54,542
It's just very, very unlikely.

365
00:19:56,044 --> 00:19:58,922
I'm sorry,
that's just my two cents.

366
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:02,050
- Yep. Yep.
- I, uh...

367
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:05,303
- Maybe you can prove me wrong.
- Okay.

368
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:14,646
Daddy?

369
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:25,407
<i>Dear Heavenly Father,
Jehovah, God,</i>

370
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,492
we thank you for this food.

371
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:30,328
We ask you to bless
the hands of the peoples

372
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:32,289
that prepared this food.

373
00:20:32,372 --> 00:20:35,417
We thank you for
this opportunity as a family

374
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,960
to come together.

375
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:39,587
And we ask you to please,

376
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:43,508
please don't let nobody get
fat from eating all this food.

377
00:20:44,801 --> 00:20:46,678
In Jesus name we pray. Amen.

378
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:48,930
Amen.

379
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:52,934
Meka,
I think he was talking to you.

380
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:56,187
Oh!

381
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:58,231
- Look at all this cheese.
- What'd you get, Isha?

382
00:20:58,315 --> 00:21:00,900
I got a little bit of work
I got to do. Uh...

383
00:21:00,984 --> 00:21:03,445
Y'all ride home
with your mother. All right?

384
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,946
Everything okay?
You all right?

385
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,073
Oh, everything's great.
Y'all just go and eat.

386
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:09,242
Bring... Bring my food home
when you come.

387
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:12,579
Bye, Daddy.

388
00:21:12,662 --> 00:21:15,206
All right.

389
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,083
- You eating his food?
- Mm-hmm.

390
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:47,947
Hey, where Tunde at,
homie?

391
00:21:48,031 --> 00:21:49,366
Roc,
what you doin', man?

392
00:21:49,449 --> 00:21:51,034
Come on.

393
00:21:51,117 --> 00:21:52,619
Did I stutter, nigga?

394
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:54,454
Hey, let's roll, homie.
Fool just went right now.

395
00:21:54,537 --> 00:21:55,580
We bounce, we can smoke 'em.

396
00:21:55,663 --> 00:21:57,791
Leave this old-ass dude alone.

397
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:01,586
You know
what my daddy taught me?

398
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:05,799
How to smoke a blunt.

399
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,594
And how to smoke
a bitch nigga, too.

400
00:22:11,638 --> 00:22:13,723
I'm real good at both.

401
00:22:19,312 --> 00:22:20,980
What you scared for, homie?

402
00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:23,191
Tell Tunde,

403
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:25,527
me and the homies
might come by later

404
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,113
and run a train on her.

405
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:30,532
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!

406
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,409
Get his ass! Get his ass!

407
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,087
Get the fuck
out the way, homie.

408
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:47,841
Smoke him, homie.

409
00:22:47,924 --> 00:22:51,136
On the turf, homie. Smoke him.

410
00:22:51,219 --> 00:22:53,596
He came and disrespect you
in our hood.

411
00:22:55,056 --> 00:22:58,393
Don't nobody give a damn
about you, homeboy.

412
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:01,521
Nobody.

413
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,907
Let's roll. Let's roll.

414
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,451
Take your balls, nigga.

415
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:56,094
They got Roc!

416
00:24:56,177 --> 00:24:57,136
Roc!
Hey, call an ambulance, nigga!

417
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,513
Call an ambulance!

418
00:24:58,596 --> 00:24:59,806
Roc!

419
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:00,807
Come on, Roc,
wake up! Talk to me!

420
00:25:02,016 --> 00:25:03,309
Get up, man.

421
00:25:08,022 --> 00:25:10,608
Come on, let's go!

422
00:26:03,036 --> 00:26:05,413
Give me this. Give me this.

423
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:19,886
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

424
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:21,846
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

425
00:26:41,574 --> 00:26:43,785
How many fingers
am I holding up?

426
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,206
How you get all nine fingers
on one hand?

427
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,170
You fine.

428
00:26:55,338 --> 00:26:57,507
Gonna take a shower.

429
00:27:09,977 --> 00:27:11,771
Where are we practicing
today, Daddy?

430
00:27:11,854 --> 00:27:13,731
Yeah, where are we
practicing today?

431
00:27:13,815 --> 00:27:15,858
Oh, we going
someplace special today.

432
00:27:15,942 --> 00:27:17,944
These houses are huge.

433
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:20,530
Yes. That one
looks like a castle.

434
00:27:20,613 --> 00:27:21,781
Y'all like these houses?

435
00:27:21,864 --> 00:27:23,032
Yes.

436
00:27:23,116 --> 00:27:24,701
That one looks
like the White House.

437
00:27:24,784 --> 00:27:26,786
Which one? Which one you like?
What's your favorite?

438
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:28,329
I like that one.

439
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:30,123
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, that one's nice.

440
00:27:30,206 --> 00:27:31,582
If that was my house,

441
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:33,751
I'd put a pool in the front
and a slide on the roof.

442
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:35,128
You'd put your pool
in the front?

443
00:27:35,211 --> 00:27:36,587
Have a big pool party.

444
00:27:36,671 --> 00:27:38,256
Everybody's gonna want
to come to my house.

445
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:39,424
Oh, you just gonna be
the crazy lady on the block.

446
00:27:39,507 --> 00:27:40,633
No. I'm gonna be

447
00:27:40,717 --> 00:27:42,260
the coolest person
on the block.

448
00:27:42,343 --> 00:27:43,761
That one
has a tennis court.

449
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:45,096
Oh, that's the one then.

450
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:46,556
- That's the one.
- Yeah.

451
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:49,434
You gonna have any one
of these houses you want.

452
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:51,269
Beverly Hills,
Hollywood Hills,

453
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:53,271
any of these old hills.

454
00:27:53,354 --> 00:27:55,481
'Cause you got a plan
and you gonna stick to it.

455
00:27:56,774 --> 00:27:58,651
When I was a little boy,
my mom used to say,

456
00:27:58,735 --> 00:28:02,447
"Son, the most strongest,
the most powerful,

457
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,491
the most dangerous creature
on this whole Earth

458
00:28:05,575 --> 00:28:08,369
is a woman
who knows how to think.

459
00:28:09,495 --> 00:28:11,622
Ain't nothing she can't do."

460
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:12,915
Y'all know how to think?

461
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:14,208
Yes, Daddy.

462
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,793
Now, these peoples
we about to go see,

463
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:17,503
you gonna show them
how dangerous you are?

464
00:28:17,587 --> 00:28:18,838
Yes, Daddy.

465
00:28:18,921 --> 00:28:20,631
Lemme see
your dangerous face.

466
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:23,009
That's your dangerous face?

467
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:24,469
There you are. There you go.

468
00:28:24,552 --> 00:28:25,720
That's your dangerous face.

469
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:27,054
Okay, don't do that
for the peoples.

470
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,473
- Don't do that.
- Don't do that.

471
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:43,237
- Hey.
- That's a nice shirt.

472
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,114
Top o' the morning to ya.

473
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:58,544
Look at that.
Look at that. Come on.

474
00:29:01,714 --> 00:29:03,299
Do you see who that is?

475
00:29:03,382 --> 00:29:04,592
- Yes.
- Who's that?

476
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:07,345
- John McEnroe?
- That's right. Who that?

477
00:29:07,428 --> 00:29:09,430
- That's Pete Sampras.
- Mm-hmm.

478
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,891
One day,
they gonna be bragging

479
00:29:11,974 --> 00:29:14,310
about the time
they met the two of you.

480
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,065
- What are you doing, Johnny?
- What?

481
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:21,776
You know he's a smoker.
Get off your heels.

482
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:24,362
- Oh, screw you.
- Screw me?

483
00:29:24,445 --> 00:29:25,863
Okay, let's take a break.

484
00:29:25,947 --> 00:29:28,366
Why are you guessing early?
Just read the toss.

485
00:29:28,449 --> 00:29:29,992
It looked like
it was going outside.

486
00:29:30,076 --> 00:29:31,702
- It did not.
- You see what he did?

487
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:32,995
Yeah, but that's what

488
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,497
you've been working
so hard for...

489
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,290
- Excuse me, Mr. Cohen?
- ...getting that shot...

490
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:37,625
Yeah?

491
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:40,419
Uh, Richard Williams.
We spoke on the phone.

492
00:29:40,503 --> 00:29:41,754
Oh, yeah. I remember.

493
00:29:41,838 --> 00:29:43,381
- The brochure.
- Yep, that's right.

494
00:29:43,464 --> 00:29:44,757
I actually brought you
another one

495
00:29:44,841 --> 00:29:46,259
in case you misplaced
the first one.

496
00:29:46,342 --> 00:29:48,553
No, no, no. I got it.
What can I do for ya?

497
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:51,222
Well, we figured you was busy.
That's why we came to see you.

498
00:29:51,305 --> 00:29:52,723
Yeah.

499
00:29:52,807 --> 00:29:54,308
Everybody says I got these two
great tennis players,

500
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,060
and we're still looking
for a coach.

501
00:29:56,143 --> 00:29:57,520
- Oh, yeah, Mr. Wilson, listen.
- No, it's Williams. Williams.

502
00:29:57,603 --> 00:29:58,771
We're in the middle
of practice here.

503
00:29:58,855 --> 00:30:00,064
This my daughter,
this is Venus.

504
00:30:00,147 --> 00:30:01,232
This is my other daughter,
Serena.

505
00:30:01,315 --> 00:30:02,900
Nice to meet you, girls.

506
00:30:02,984 --> 00:30:04,402
It won't take but a minute
to watch them hit a few balls.

507
00:30:04,485 --> 00:30:05,736
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I'm not taking any juniors

508
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,321
right now,
and we're in the middle

509
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:08,739
- of a very serious practice.
- Well, I don't mean

510
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:09,907
to interrupt nothing.
Uh, Mac, Pete.

511
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:11,117
Oh, tough break at Wimbledon.

512
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,410
I see what happened
to you, Mac.

513
00:30:12,493 --> 00:30:13,411
Uh, you...
You gonna win again.

514
00:30:13,494 --> 00:30:14,745
Just keep your head up.

515
00:30:14,829 --> 00:30:16,122
Mr. Williams,

516
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:17,415
- this is not a good time.
- Wait. Listen. Look...

517
00:30:17,498 --> 00:30:18,791
All right?

518
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:19,834
- We're in the middle of...
- I just want you to

519
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:21,043
watch them hit a few.

520
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:22,295
Look, Mac is gone.
Mac is gone.

521
00:30:22,378 --> 00:30:23,421
The way Pete
whipping up on him,

522
00:30:23,504 --> 00:30:24,922
he may never come back.

523
00:30:25,006 --> 00:30:26,591
Look, Pete, you don't mind

524
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:28,301
if he just watch 'em
hit a few balls, do you?

525
00:30:28,384 --> 00:30:29,760
It's okay with me.

526
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:33,097
See? Come on. Mac is gone.
Pete's okay. We ready.

527
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,765
You the only person
got a problem with this.

528
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:36,851
Come on.
Watch 'em hit a few balls.

529
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:38,436
You girls
are pretty good, huh?

530
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:39,687
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

531
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,772
Oh, they better than good.

532
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:44,525
- All right. A few balls.
- A few balls. That's...

533
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,985
- Come on, come on.
- Come on, girls.

534
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:48,112
Show him this magic.
Show him this magic.

535
00:30:48,195 --> 00:30:51,782
Hey, that's
their brochure, Pete.

536
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:53,117
Now you take a look at that.

537
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,493
I'mma have them sign it
for you later.

538
00:30:54,577 --> 00:30:56,120
- Come on, come on.
- Got it.

539
00:30:56,203 --> 00:30:57,204
So tell me your names again.

540
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,664
- I'm Venus.
- I'm Serena.

541
00:30:58,748 --> 00:31:00,041
Venus and Serena. I'm Paul.

542
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,709
Oh, yeah,
no, no, you not Paul.

543
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:02,835
You Mr. Cohen.

544
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,004
Mr. Cohen, right.

545
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:06,756
All right, Serena, why
don't you start at forehand?

546
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,090
Venus, backhand.

547
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:09,884
We'll hit some down the line,
all right?

548
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:10,968
That's good, Paul. That's how
I usually start with 'em too.

549
00:31:11,052 --> 00:31:12,011
That's real smart.

550
00:31:12,094 --> 00:31:14,597
Good.
All right, ready?

551
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,070
That's right.
Show him the magic.

552
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,489
There you go.
Good power, Venus Williams.

553
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:33,908
That's it.

554
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:36,994
What you think, Pete?

555
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:38,371
They look good.

556
00:31:38,454 --> 00:31:41,415
They good. I know they good.
I know they good.

557
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:45,169
Pete Sampras
is looking at you.

558
00:31:45,252 --> 00:31:48,089
Pete Sampras
gonna steal your stuff.

559
00:31:49,131 --> 00:31:51,634
All right, great job, girls.

560
00:31:51,717 --> 00:31:53,177
So, Serena, why don't
you go get some water?

561
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,513
I wanna hit with your sister
for a minute.

562
00:31:55,596 --> 00:31:57,890
Venus, you wanna try something
a little different?

563
00:31:57,974 --> 00:31:59,600
Okay, so start in the middle.

564
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:02,103
I want you to go after
every single ball, all right?

565
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:03,479
I'm not gonna tell you
where they're coming.

566
00:32:03,562 --> 00:32:04,814
But don't stop
until we're done.

567
00:32:04,897 --> 00:32:07,233
Oh, she do that.
She'll do that.

568
00:32:10,236 --> 00:32:11,821
There you go.

569
00:32:11,904 --> 00:32:14,240
Yeah, I want
you to recover each time.

570
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,372
Get it.
Show it to him.

571
00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:23,499
You have to
show him that magic.

572
00:32:28,337 --> 00:32:32,717
Yes. There you go.
There you go.

573
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:35,386
Get it. All right.

574
00:32:35,469 --> 00:32:37,013
Okay.

575
00:32:37,096 --> 00:32:39,140
Girls, come here
and talk to me for a second.

576
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,183
Hustle, hustle, hustle.

577
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,562
Lemme ask
you both something.

578
00:32:45,479 --> 00:32:47,148
What do you want out of this?

579
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:50,609
I know what your dad wants,
but what about you?

580
00:32:50,693 --> 00:32:51,902
Well, I wanna win Wimbledon

581
00:32:51,986 --> 00:32:54,071
as many times
as anyone's ever won it.

582
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:56,198
You think you can do that?

583
00:32:56,282 --> 00:32:57,742
I know I can.

584
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:00,411
What about you?

585
00:33:00,494 --> 00:33:02,621
Who on the tour
do you wanna play like?

586
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,127
Well, I'd like other people
to want to play like me.

587
00:33:09,462 --> 00:33:11,422
I bet they will.

588
00:33:11,505 --> 00:33:14,508
All right,
you girls go pick 'em up.

589
00:33:19,472 --> 00:33:21,223
Come on, Paul, let's go.

590
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:25,186
You taught 'em all this?

591
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:26,771
Oh, yeah,
me and my wife, Brandy.

592
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:28,647
We both athletes.

593
00:33:30,024 --> 00:33:32,151
So, what you think?

594
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:37,156
- Is this a bee you're drawing?
- Yes, it is.

595
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:38,449
You're not working on...

596
00:33:38,532 --> 00:33:40,201
I thought y'all
were doing homework.

597
00:33:46,582 --> 00:33:49,126
We got a coach.

598
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:56,092
You little fakers.

599
00:33:56,175 --> 00:33:57,551
You little fakers!

600
00:33:59,386 --> 00:34:02,264
- Pete Sampras's coach?
- Mm-hmm.

601
00:34:02,348 --> 00:34:03,432
Sure as hell.

602
00:34:03,516 --> 00:34:05,601
So he's gonna do it for free?

603
00:34:05,684 --> 00:34:06,644
Um...

604
00:34:06,727 --> 00:34:09,313
He said he can't
do two for free.

605
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:10,773
What?

606
00:34:10,856 --> 00:34:12,274
He only gonna teach Venus.

607
00:34:12,358 --> 00:34:14,735
Okay, okay,
you should have seen Venus.

608
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,028
Pete Sampras was there

609
00:34:16,112 --> 00:34:17,404
and I don't think
he could beat her at all.

610
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,531
Sampras? Okay, Venus!

611
00:34:18,614 --> 00:34:20,032
We were so good.

612
00:34:20,116 --> 00:34:21,659
Did you tell Serena?

613
00:34:21,742 --> 00:34:23,119
I know.

614
00:34:23,202 --> 00:34:24,954
And then, we only
hit the net, like, twice.

615
00:34:25,037 --> 00:34:26,455
Do you want to?

616
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:27,915
Oh, Richard.

617
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:30,334
We got
a coach. We got a coach.

618
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:31,502
We got a coach.

619
00:34:31,585 --> 00:34:32,795
We got a coach.
We got a coach.

620
00:34:38,968 --> 00:34:42,847
It's not fair.
I wanna go with you.

621
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,224
I know.
I want you to, too.

622
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:49,603
Meka, Daddy said he's gonna
record everything,

623
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,272
and then we can
watch it together.

624
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,732
He has a plan, okay?

625
00:34:53,816 --> 00:34:55,317
Yeah, for you.

626
00:34:55,401 --> 00:34:58,028
Okay, Meka, your mom ready.
Y'all gonna practice today.

627
00:34:58,112 --> 00:35:00,656
But, Daddy,
I can't practice on her court.

628
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:02,116
She always hits slices.

629
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,952
That ain't nothing
but a few minor adjustments.

630
00:35:05,035 --> 00:35:06,245
You got to stay prepared

631
00:35:06,328 --> 00:35:09,248
for whatever's unpredictable.
Okay?

632
00:35:09,331 --> 00:35:11,584
Come on now,
give your daddy a kiss.

633
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:14,086
Don't put no mean on my face.
Come on.

634
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,631
Daddy love you.
Come on, Junior, let's go.

635
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:28,934
I know you feel left out.
But you're not left out.

636
00:35:31,103 --> 00:35:32,980
You got something great, too.

637
00:35:33,063 --> 00:35:35,357
- What?
- Me!

638
00:35:36,484 --> 00:35:38,360
Come on, we got work to do.

639
00:35:38,444 --> 00:35:40,905
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now.

640
00:35:40,988 --> 00:35:43,073
I ain't raised no poop butts.

641
00:35:43,157 --> 00:35:45,743
- Mom...
- Come on. We got work to do.

642
00:35:45,826 --> 00:35:47,745
Go. That's it.

643
00:35:47,828 --> 00:35:50,414
Back. Centre. And back.

644
00:35:50,497 --> 00:35:51,916
What you're going through

645
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:53,918
is the Paul Cohen first-strike
strategic tennis system.

646
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:55,920
It's gonna turn you
into a killer.

647
00:35:56,003 --> 00:35:57,671
You're gonna learn to think
about this tennis court

648
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:01,133
as a chessboard
made up of 228 shots.

649
00:36:01,217 --> 00:36:02,927
You will learn
to perfect them all.

650
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:05,387
Did I say stop?
Go, go, go. Again.

651
00:36:05,471 --> 00:36:07,139
Centre.

652
00:36:07,223 --> 00:36:11,310
Come on! Up, up, up!
Explode! Side!

653
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,272
Up, up, up! Back!

654
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:19,568
Side, side, side. I need
you to be faster, Serena.

655
00:36:19,652 --> 00:36:21,654
24...

656
00:36:23,364 --> 00:36:25,115
25... Oh, halfway there.
Come on.

657
00:36:26,283 --> 00:36:27,493
26...

658
00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:31,664
Oh! Come on, back to
the middle each time.

659
00:36:31,747 --> 00:36:32,831
Let's get 50.

660
00:36:32,915 --> 00:36:34,959
Make sure you keep
that stance open.

661
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:36,585
Please, Richard...

662
00:36:38,754 --> 00:36:41,006
Oh! Blame your dad.

663
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:44,301
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop.
What are you doing?

664
00:36:44,385 --> 00:36:46,887
This is it. What! That's it.

665
00:36:49,765 --> 00:36:51,141
Trust it, trust it.

666
00:36:51,225 --> 00:36:53,185
Better!

667
00:36:53,269 --> 00:36:54,728
Yes!

668
00:36:57,606 --> 00:36:58,899
Yeah.

669
00:37:00,276 --> 00:37:02,278
Lemme see
a little bit more pronation

670
00:37:02,361 --> 00:37:04,071
on that wrist
right at the end.

671
00:37:04,154 --> 00:37:05,614
You just focus right here.

672
00:37:05,698 --> 00:37:07,366
You know
exactly what you're doing.

673
00:37:07,449 --> 00:37:09,868
Do you want to be the best?
You can do it. You know why?

674
00:37:09,952 --> 00:37:11,453
Because you're
a killing machine.

675
00:37:11,537 --> 00:37:16,083
You're a goddamn attack dog.
So, bite.

676
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:17,668
Talk a little louder, Paul.
Can't hear you.

677
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:18,961
That wasn't for you, Richard.

678
00:37:19,044 --> 00:37:20,754
I'm trying
to record though, Paul.

679
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,673
You can
interview me later.

680
00:37:25,759 --> 00:37:27,344
- Yes!
- There you go.

681
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:30,472
Yes! That's what the pronation
gets you right there.

682
00:37:32,308 --> 00:37:33,350
Really?

683
00:37:35,352 --> 00:37:37,771
Yeah! Keep it up. Keep it up.

684
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,273
That's the move.

685
00:37:39,356 --> 00:37:40,858
Now get back to the middle.
Get back to the middle.

686
00:37:40,941 --> 00:37:42,526
You never know
where that ball's gonna go.

687
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:44,361
You gotta be ready.
Stay low, stay low,

688
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:46,071
stay low, stay low, stay low.

689
00:37:46,155 --> 00:37:48,365
Yeah, baby! Yes!

690
00:37:48,449 --> 00:37:53,370
Go!
You're on it. That's it.

691
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:56,874
End the point. Recover quick.
You gotta move faster.

692
00:37:56,957 --> 00:37:58,542
Hold on, Junior, Junior.
Junior.

693
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:00,377
All right, Paul, one second.

694
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:02,087
Look, you just got
a little closed up that time.

695
00:38:02,171 --> 00:38:03,339
You're doing real good.

696
00:38:03,422 --> 00:38:05,132
You just gotta keep
that stance open.

697
00:38:05,215 --> 00:38:06,717
- You plant that right foot...
- What are you doing, Richard?

698
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,010
...that's how you get
a little closed off...

699
00:38:08,093 --> 00:38:10,220
Richard, what are you doing?

700
00:38:10,304 --> 00:38:12,222
I'm talking to my daughter.
Is something wrong with that?

701
00:38:12,306 --> 00:38:13,599
No, nothing wrong with that.

702
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:15,309
Except you want me
to fix her stance,

703
00:38:15,392 --> 00:38:16,769
and I can't do that if you
keep telling her to hit open.

704
00:38:16,852 --> 00:38:18,103
Well, Paul, ain't no reason

705
00:38:18,187 --> 00:38:19,813
to fix something
that's not broke. Okay?

706
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,231
You've been hollering
at the girl

707
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:22,900
all day long
to get back to the middle,

708
00:38:22,983 --> 00:38:24,485
get back to the middle.
That's all I hear you saying.

709
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,653
Yet you instructing her
to close her stance.

710
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:28,030
That's right.

711
00:38:28,113 --> 00:38:29,239
How's she supposed to get back
to the middle

712
00:38:29,323 --> 00:38:30,574
with her stance all closed up?

713
00:38:30,657 --> 00:38:33,327
Okay, if she stays open,
she can plant that foot.

714
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,745
- More power, more speed.
- No!

715
00:38:34,828 --> 00:38:35,913
That's how she get back
to the middle.

716
00:38:35,996 --> 00:38:37,539
That is not how you get power.

717
00:38:37,623 --> 00:38:39,249
You want power in your stroke,
you square your shoulders,

718
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:40,834
you close your stance,

719
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,544
hold your head right at
contact, and blast through it.

720
00:38:42,628 --> 00:38:44,922
You do not hit open stance.
Okay?

721
00:38:45,005 --> 00:38:46,590
- Yep.
- Can we please get back to it?

722
00:38:46,673 --> 00:38:47,883
But just keep
your mind open, Paul.

723
00:38:47,966 --> 00:38:49,176
You know,
just in case you not...

724
00:38:49,259 --> 00:38:50,636
Richard, it would be
really helpful...

725
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,137
...the smartest person
in the whole world.

726
00:38:52,221 --> 00:38:53,764
...if we could
actually hit a few.

727
00:38:53,847 --> 00:38:55,432
- Okay, yeah, you can hit 'em.
- Because I got about

728
00:38:55,516 --> 00:38:57,101
18 minutes left and I'd like
to finish this practice.

729
00:38:57,184 --> 00:38:58,268
It just don't make no sense
what you saying, Paul.

730
00:38:58,352 --> 00:38:59,937
If she keep her stance closed,

731
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,522
- feet are all jumbled up...
- I'll tell you what, Richard.

732
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,273
She's not gonna
be able to get back.

733
00:39:03,357 --> 00:39:04,817
I'll get my lesson from
you when we're done, okay?

734
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,443
But right now,
I'd like to focus on Venus.

735
00:39:06,527 --> 00:39:07,820
Okay, yeah, I keep forgetting
you know everything.

736
00:39:07,903 --> 00:39:08,612
- 17 minutes now.
- I keep forgetting that.

737
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:09,947
That's it.

738
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,698
Okay, just as long as
she hits some open.

739
00:39:16,203 --> 00:39:17,329
Keep that stance open, Junior.

740
00:39:17,413 --> 00:39:19,248
Recover,
recover, recover.

741
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:21,375
Get around it. Get around it.
I want a forehand.

742
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,252
I want a forehand.
Get back to center.

743
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:24,586
There you go.

744
00:39:28,715 --> 00:39:31,218
<i>Great serve.
You know, Capriati is...</i>

745
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:32,886
Dang, that's Capriati?

746
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,638
Now,
she's a freaking killer.

747
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:36,682
Won the Junior Orange Bowl
in Miami

748
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:38,809
in the U.S. 18 and Under
when she was 12.

749
00:39:38,892 --> 00:39:40,477
Just went pro last year.

750
00:39:40,561 --> 00:39:42,729
That's her coach Rick Macci.
He's in Florida.

751
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,731
About as dumb
as the rest, but...

752
00:39:44,815 --> 00:39:47,776
she is the youngest pro ever
to be ranked in the Top 10.

753
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,611
And guess what she just did?

754
00:39:49,695 --> 00:39:51,738
She just beat Steffi Graf.

755
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:53,824
How do you think
she learned how to do that?

756
00:39:53,907 --> 00:39:56,577
Juniors.
That's where the fight is.

757
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,163
That's where you face
adversity, competition.

758
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:00,747
It's also where
you get noticed by agents

759
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,249
who can help you pay
for the training

760
00:40:02,332 --> 00:40:03,834
and introduce you to sponsors.

761
00:40:03,917 --> 00:40:06,086
Capriati signed a $2 million
contract with Diadora

762
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,464
before she played
a single pro match.

763
00:40:08,547 --> 00:40:10,132
How do you think
that happened?

764
00:40:10,215 --> 00:40:11,216
Juniors.

765
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,431
So, what do you guys say?
Wanna play Juniors?

766
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:22,895
I think I can add that
to the plan.

767
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,772
We play some Juniors.

768
00:40:29,776 --> 00:40:32,696
Come on. Come on.
Do you feel good?

769
00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:34,948
- Yes. I'm excited.
- Okay.

770
00:40:37,409 --> 00:40:38,702
Good morning.
Good morning.

771
00:40:38,785 --> 00:40:40,370
Did you see that, Mom?

772
00:40:40,454 --> 00:40:41,538
It's okay.

773
00:40:41,622 --> 00:40:42,706
They're just
not used to seeing

774
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:44,541
good-looking peoples like us.

775
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:45,709
You don't worry about them.

776
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:47,127
Let them worry about you,
Venus.

777
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,796
Oh, this it.
This it right here.

778
00:40:51,256 --> 00:40:54,635
Come on, come on, come on.
Just take a step there.

779
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,136
- Kick their butts.
- All right, y'all.

780
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,305
- Have fun. Bye.
- Thanks. Love you.

781
00:40:58,388 --> 00:40:59,556
All right.

782
00:41:00,974 --> 00:41:04,645
Okay. You just focus
on that ball. Okay?

783
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:07,606
You are Venus Williams.

784
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:10,400
You gonna win Wimbledon.

785
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:11,944
These girls ain't never
gonna wanna see

786
00:41:12,027 --> 00:41:15,113
your name in their draw. Okay?

787
00:41:15,197 --> 00:41:16,323
Okay, Daddy.

788
00:41:16,406 --> 00:41:18,116
You just go on out there
and you have fun.

789
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,536
I know. I got this.

790
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:22,287
- All right.
- Okay. I love you.

791
00:41:22,371 --> 00:41:23,413
I love you.

792
00:41:49,064 --> 00:41:50,983
All right, girls,
meet at the net.

793
00:42:03,495 --> 00:42:06,498
Best of three sets.
Tiebreaks at six-all.

794
00:42:06,582 --> 00:42:08,166
I'm covering three courts.

795
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,461
So, keep your own score
and call your own lines.

796
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:18,594
Good luck.

797
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,433
Okay, up or down?

798
00:42:25,434 --> 00:42:27,352
Up, I guess. Thanks.

799
00:42:31,064 --> 00:42:33,233
Down. You can serve.

800
00:42:47,914 --> 00:42:51,293
She knows who she is.
We've done our job.

801
00:42:51,376 --> 00:42:52,628
Yeah, yeah.

802
00:42:52,711 --> 00:42:54,087
- She'll be fine.
- Mm-hmm.

803
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:55,839
Come on, V,
you got this!

804
00:42:55,922 --> 00:42:57,132
Good luck, V!

805
00:42:58,133 --> 00:42:59,301
Come on, Venus.

806
00:43:03,597 --> 00:43:07,768
She's nervous. Take a step up.

807
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,728
You just have some
fun out there, Venus Williams.

808
00:43:09,811 --> 00:43:11,647
That's all this about.
Have some fun.

809
00:43:23,825 --> 00:43:25,160
Good job, V!

810
00:43:25,243 --> 00:43:27,454
Maybe she ought to take
a few more steps up.

811
00:43:27,537 --> 00:43:29,289
You know,
just get someplace safe.

812
00:43:31,249 --> 00:43:32,292
Don't move.

813
00:43:45,806 --> 00:43:47,349
You are so freaking stupid.

814
00:43:47,432 --> 00:43:49,518
- All right, Venus!
- Go, Venus!

815
00:43:51,645 --> 00:43:52,979
All right, V.

816
00:43:54,648 --> 00:43:56,274
- You watching? You watching?
- Mm-hmm.

817
00:44:00,779 --> 00:44:02,948
You're so bad!

818
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:05,951
Damn!

819
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:07,160
Good job!

820
00:44:08,537 --> 00:44:09,996
I am talking to you.
I am talking to you.

821
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,748
Do you even want to be
out there right now?

822
00:44:11,832 --> 00:44:12,999
Do you?

823
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,292
Because the way
that you just played,

824
00:44:14,376 --> 00:44:15,794
it's hard to believe
that you do.

825
00:44:19,715 --> 00:44:20,757
Thank you.

826
00:44:22,718 --> 00:44:25,011
Venus!

827
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,596
Get in here,
get in here.

828
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,889
I'm so proud of you.

829
00:44:27,973 --> 00:44:29,349
Get in my picture.
Get in my picture.

830
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:31,685
Come on, come on.
Come on, Paul!

831
00:44:31,768 --> 00:44:32,936
Say, "Venus!"

832
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:35,147
Venus!

833
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,940
That's it. That's it.

834
00:44:41,361 --> 00:44:43,405
Bad sportsmanship.

835
00:44:43,488 --> 00:44:45,407
Yeah!

836
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:48,118
Can I take a picture
with the winner?

837
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:49,411
Right here. Hold it.

838
00:44:49,494 --> 00:44:50,871
- Oh, you look so good.
- So proud of you.

839
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:56,251
Let's go, Venus!

840
00:44:56,334 --> 00:45:00,130
Kelly. Kelly. Kelly.
It was out. Call it.

841
00:45:00,213 --> 00:45:01,423
It was out.

842
00:45:01,506 --> 00:45:03,467
- What?
- No.

843
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,302
No, it wasn't.

844
00:45:05,385 --> 00:45:07,179
- It wasn't out, though.
- Can they do that?

845
00:45:07,262 --> 00:45:08,638
- It's all right.
- They can't do that.

846
00:45:08,722 --> 00:45:10,056
That's okay, Junior.

847
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,975
Just do what you do.

848
00:45:12,058 --> 00:45:14,728
- Just cheating.
- That's all right.

849
00:45:14,811 --> 00:45:17,355
Just watch this one.

850
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:20,150
- Come on, Venus.
- You got this, V.

851
00:45:20,233 --> 00:45:21,735
30-40.

852
00:45:32,037 --> 00:45:35,248
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah, V, good job!

853
00:45:37,083 --> 00:45:38,668
All right. All right.

854
00:45:38,752 --> 00:45:39,795
That's it.

855
00:45:42,714 --> 00:45:44,007
It's all right.

856
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:45,842
- Come on, y'all.
- What's wrong?

857
00:45:45,926 --> 00:45:47,052
- That's okay.
- What's wrong? You won.

858
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,386
Okay, you can smile.

859
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:49,846
You can smile.

860
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:51,014
That was good.

861
00:45:51,097 --> 00:45:52,849
A little adversity.
That's okay.

862
00:45:57,395 --> 00:45:58,647
You're missin' it.

863
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,315
No, I can hear everything
with that ball.

864
00:46:00,398 --> 00:46:02,192
- Good play.
- Come on!

865
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:04,194
You got this.

866
00:46:09,574 --> 00:46:10,700
Did you see any of that?

867
00:46:10,784 --> 00:46:13,537
Yes, I saw some of that.

868
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,121
Come on, y'all, come on.

- You were so good.

873
00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:29,469
I told you that girl
was a pusher.

874
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,138
Yeah, Paul calls that
"playing patty-cake."

875
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,558
That's why she got moded.

876
00:46:34,641 --> 00:46:36,643
Moded. Corroded.

877
00:46:36,726 --> 00:46:39,646
Your booty exploded.

You should be very proud
of yourself. You did good.

888
00:47:47,505 --> 00:47:48,506
Well done.

889
00:47:49,382 --> 00:47:50,800
Mommy, wait.

890
00:47:50,884 --> 00:47:53,136
<i>The first place

892
00:48:00,018 --> 00:48:01,436
Go, V!

Moded. Corroded.
Your booty exploded.

896
00:48:08,777 --> 00:48:10,528
That looked
kinda heavy up there.

897
00:48:10,612 --> 00:48:13,073
Let me see.
Let me see that big ol' thing.

898
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:14,324
Ooh. I'm about to drop it.

899
00:48:14,407 --> 00:48:15,992
Were you
nervous at all, V?

900
00:48:16,076 --> 00:48:17,160
Why is she nervous?

901
00:48:17,243 --> 00:48:18,411
That girl looked like
she was 18

902
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:20,163
and Venus
still whupped her anyway.

903
00:48:20,246 --> 00:48:22,290
- Yeah.
- Yes, she did.

904
00:48:22,374 --> 00:48:23,875
Okay, that's enough of that
back there.

905
00:48:23,959 --> 00:48:25,335
No more tennis talk.

906
00:48:25,418 --> 00:48:27,087
And stop all that bragging.

907
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,380
Daddy,
we're not bragging.

908
00:48:28,463 --> 00:48:30,632
Oh, you're not?
What you doing?

909
00:48:30,715 --> 00:48:33,551
I mean, it's just the truth,
and here's the proof.

910
00:48:33,635 --> 00:48:34,970
That's right.

911
00:48:35,053 --> 00:48:36,471
Right now,
let's hear what I'm saying.

912
00:48:36,554 --> 00:48:37,639
Stop all that bragging.

913
00:48:37,722 --> 00:48:39,557
Richard, they're not bragging.

914
00:48:39,641 --> 00:48:40,892
They bragging.

915
00:48:40,976 --> 00:48:42,227
- I'm listening to 'em.
- They're having fun.

916
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:43,478
I know what bragging
sounds like.

917
00:48:43,561 --> 00:48:44,771
The girl won.
She's just happy.

918
00:48:44,854 --> 00:48:45,772
Look, Junior won,
the other girl lost.

919
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:47,190
Everybody did their best.

920
00:48:47,273 --> 00:48:48,900
And I'm not gonna hear
no more about it now.

921
00:48:52,445 --> 00:48:54,155
If that was that girl's best,

922
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:55,740
then she needs
to practice some more.

923
00:48:55,824 --> 00:48:58,243
I'm just saying. Jeez.

924
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:08,044
Okay, you big shots.

925
00:49:08,128 --> 00:49:09,212
Here's five bucks.

926
00:49:09,295 --> 00:49:10,714
Go on and get me
something to drink.

927
00:49:10,797 --> 00:49:11,840
- I wanna get something.
- Stop. Stop. Stop.

928
00:49:11,923 --> 00:49:13,383
Uh, give the money to Tunde.

929
00:49:13,466 --> 00:49:14,884
- Give the money to Tunde.
- Stop arguing. Stop arguing.

930
00:49:14,968 --> 00:49:16,344
Why do they always take
the money from me?

931
00:49:16,428 --> 00:49:17,721
Daddy gave it to me.
Not to you, Tunde.

932
00:49:31,818 --> 00:49:33,278
Richard...

933
00:49:34,112 --> 00:49:35,405
Where are you going?

934
00:49:35,488 --> 00:49:36,698
They wanna brag, let them brag

935
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:38,450
about how they walked
three miles home.

936
00:49:38,533 --> 00:49:40,618
Richard, you can't leave
those girls like that.

937
00:49:40,702 --> 00:49:42,245
I done told them I didn't
wanna hear nothing about

938
00:49:42,328 --> 00:49:46,124
- no tennis and no bragging.
- Richard, stop! Stop!

939
00:49:46,207 --> 00:49:47,917
You can't leave them
back there like that.

940
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:49,544
Leaving 'em
on the streets like that.

941
00:49:49,627 --> 00:49:50,587
You can't do that.

942
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:52,255
Okay, look at me. Listen here.

943
00:49:52,338 --> 00:49:54,632

You go back and get my girls.

00:49:54,716 --> 00:49:56,051
When these matches is over,

945
00:49:56,134 --> 00:49:58,553
I don't wanna hear
nothing about no tennis.

946
00:49:58,636 --> 00:50:01,806
Okay? They can talk
about Kingdom Hall,

947
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:04,601
they can talk about dinosaurs,
they can talk about space.

948
00:50:04,684 --> 00:50:06,019
- Space?
- But I don't wanna hear...

949
00:50:06,102 --> 00:50:07,604
Why is it that
you gotta ruin...

950
00:50:07,687 --> 00:50:08,772
- ...nothing about no tennis.
- ...everybody else's day?

951
00:50:08,855 --> 00:50:10,106
You don't wanna be happy...

952
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:11,733
I don't
wanna hear no bragging.

953
00:50:11,816 --> 00:50:13,318
...so you don't want
nobody else to be happy.

954
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:14,944
- This ain't about being happy.
- No...

955
00:50:15,028 --> 00:50:16,446
- It's about bragging.
- ...it is about it.

956
00:50:16,529 --> 00:50:17,989
You don't want
nobody else to be happy...

957
00:50:18,073 --> 00:50:19,657
I told them
I don't want no bragging.

958
00:50:19,741 --> 00:50:21,159
...so you gotta make
everybody else upset.

959
00:50:21,242 --> 00:50:22,577
I have never in my life...
Never ever met

960
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,620
somebody who just
don't wanna be happy.

961
00:50:23,703 --> 00:50:25,121
I don't want no bragging.

962
00:50:25,205 --> 00:50:26,956
You go back and get my girls.
That's what you do.

00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,124

00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,259
Daddy, where were you going?
I thought you were leaving us.

Well, you gotta be

If you're not gonna listen

1002
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,238
- I answered your question.
- Okay, okay.

1003
00:52:22,322 --> 00:52:23,740
They answered your questions.

1004
00:52:23,823 --> 00:52:25,742
All right, all right.
Hold on. Hold on.

1005
00:52:25,825 --> 00:52:29,162
The point is she was humble.

1006
00:52:29,245 --> 00:52:31,915
No matter how
them peoples treated her,

1007
00:52:31,998 --> 00:52:34,000
no matter how disrespected,

1008
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:37,921
she stayed calm,
she kept her heart clean.

1009
00:52:38,838 --> 00:52:40,924
She was humble.

1010
00:52:41,007 --> 00:52:43,301
Now we gonna go out here and

1011
00:52:43,384 --> 00:52:45,261

But we gonna stay humble,
else we not gonna do it.

1013
00:52:51,142 --> 00:52:53,561
All right, y'all can go ahead
with yourself.

1014
00:53:03,529 --> 00:53:05,573
You feel good about yourself?

1015
00:53:07,325 --> 00:53:08,701
I mean,
I think they got the point.

1016
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:11,371
Never drive off
on my kids again.

1017
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:12,956
- Ever.

1018
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:14,916

'cause they not gonna bounce.

1023

If they hit the ground,

1024
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:35,603
I need you to take it
right out of the air.

1025
00:53:35,687 --> 00:53:37,730
Take it right out the air.

1026
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:40,024

00:54:29,073 --> 00:54:30,658
Go ahead.
Y'all get in the car.

1041
00:55:04,233 --> 00:55:05,943
Daddy,
why are the police here?

1042
00:55:06,027 --> 00:55:07,236
I don't know.

1043
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,075
Do you
sometimes don't get

1044
00:55:12,158 --> 00:55:13,451
to have dinner
before you go to sleep?

1045
00:55:13,534 --> 00:55:15,119
No, ma'am.

1046
00:55:15,203 --> 00:55:17,205
What's going on?
Everybody okay?

1047
00:55:17,288 --> 00:55:18,790
They got a call.

1048
00:55:18,873 --> 00:55:20,500
Said there was trouble
in the house,

1049
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,418
and that we were being rough
with the girls,

1050
00:55:22,502 --> 00:55:24,253
and they needed to look.

1051
00:55:24,337 --> 00:55:27,340
- A call from who?
- Not at liberty to say.

1052
00:55:29,842 --> 00:55:32,136
- Okay, okay.
- Yeah.

1053
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,097
You... You all need
to look around?

1054
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,265
Go ahead, you can check on
in the cupboards.

1055
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:37,850
Maybe you go check
under their beds,

1056
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,310
make sure there's no monsters.

1057
00:55:39,394 --> 00:55:40,978
It's a little wet
for practice, don't you think?

1058
00:55:41,062 --> 00:55:42,230
Don't the girls have
schoolwork to do?

1059
00:55:42,313 --> 00:55:44,399
They do their homework.

1060
00:55:44,482 --> 00:55:48,111
Tunde's first in her class.
Lyn and Isha are, too.

1061
00:55:48,194 --> 00:55:51,531
That's right.
Girls, spell "civilization."

1062
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:54,992
C-I-V-I-L-I-Z-A-T-I-O-N.

1063
00:55:55,076 --> 00:55:56,369
- Okay, Mr. Williams...
- Wait, now hold on.

1064
00:55:56,452 --> 00:55:57,495
...this is
really not necessary.

1065
00:55:57,578 --> 00:55:58,955
Hold on.

1066
00:55:59,038 --> 00:56:01,666
You wanna check on the kids?
Let's check on the kids.

1067
00:56:03,376 --> 00:56:06,087
We got future doctors
and lawyers,

1068
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:10,133
plus a couple of tennis stars
in this house.

1069
00:56:10,216 --> 00:56:11,843
Now, I understand
you got to do your job

1070
00:56:11,926 --> 00:56:14,846
even if some
crazy-ass neighbor do call,

1071
00:56:14,929 --> 00:56:16,806
talking foolishness.

1072
00:56:16,889 --> 00:56:18,850
And I don't even mind you
saying we hard on these kids,

1073
00:56:18,933 --> 00:56:21,102
you know why? 'Cause we are!

1074
00:56:21,185 --> 00:56:25,273
That's our job,
to keep 'em off these streets.

1075
00:56:25,356 --> 00:56:27,525
You wanna arrest us
for that? Fine.

1076
00:56:27,608 --> 00:56:29,068
But what you not
gonna never do

1077
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,236
is come knock on this door

1078
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:31,612
talking about you have to blow

1079
00:56:31,696 --> 00:56:33,322
their damn brains out
in them streets

1080
00:56:33,406 --> 00:56:34,991
'cause they running
with hoodlums

1081
00:56:35,074 --> 00:56:36,367
and doing drugs and things.

1082
00:56:36,451 --> 00:56:39,996
That's what you not never
gonna say in this house.

1083
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,874
You wanna arrest us for that?

1084
00:56:42,957 --> 00:56:44,417
That's fine.
You need to be arresting

1085
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,043
them parents
at them tennis matches.

1086
00:56:46,127 --> 00:56:48,754
That's who needs
to be getting arrested.

1087
00:57:05,521 --> 00:57:07,690
- Hey, where you going?
- I'll be back.

1088
00:57:28,961 --> 00:57:30,880
- Hey, Betty.
- Oracene.

1089
00:57:30,963 --> 00:57:32,924
I've never been
over here before.

1090
00:57:33,007 --> 00:57:34,467
- You haven't.
- That's a shame.

1091
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:36,052
It is.

1092
00:57:36,135 --> 00:57:39,388
I know you know how hard it is
raising a daughter.

1093
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,975
I have five of them.

1094
00:57:43,809 --> 00:57:44,977
Five.

1095
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:50,233
Don't make me come back
over here again.

1096
00:58:22,473 --> 00:58:24,100
All right, Venus,
you're running a little late.

1097
00:58:24,183 --> 00:58:26,060
It's about to start.
So you're on court three.

1098
00:58:26,143 --> 00:58:27,311
- Good luck out there.
- Thank you.

1099
00:58:27,395 --> 00:58:29,855
Okay, come on.
Come on. Come on.

1100
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:32,900
Can't be the only Black
peoples here and be late.

1101
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:39,991
Um, Serena Williams.
10 and under.

1102
00:58:40,074 --> 00:58:42,451
- I'm signing in, too.
- Oh, okay.

1103
00:58:42,535 --> 00:58:45,121
Let me find you here.
You are on court nine.

1104
00:58:45,204 --> 00:58:46,706
I'll send your opponent
right over.

1105
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:48,165
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1106
00:58:51,627 --> 00:58:52,962
There you go.

1107
00:58:53,045 --> 00:58:55,756
Great shot, Venus Williams.
Good decision.

1108
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,800
Your daughter
looks good out there.

1109
00:58:57,883 --> 00:58:59,427
Yeah, thank you.
She a little tight today.

1110
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:03,764
No, I mean the little one.
She looks like a champ, too.

1111
00:59:03,848 --> 00:59:06,475
Could have warned us, man.
I didn't know you had two.

1112
00:59:39,258 --> 00:59:42,053
May as well let her finish.

1113
00:59:42,136 --> 00:59:43,679
Come on!

1114
00:59:43,763 --> 00:59:45,931
Whoo!

1115
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:54,523
What you doing?

1116
00:59:56,692 --> 00:59:59,320
You done started,
now you might as well finish.

1117
01:00:00,571 --> 01:00:03,157
Go on.
Just make sure you have fun.

1118
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,242
That's all we here to do.
Go ahead. Have fun.

Serena Williams!

1120
01:00:11,332 --> 01:00:14,919
- You knew about this?
- No. Mm-mm.

1121
01:00:16,712 --> 01:00:17,838
That's real.

1122
01:00:19,298 --> 01:00:21,425
Hey, you want it? We can swap.

1123
01:00:21,509 --> 01:00:23,052
I like silver better anyway.

1124
01:00:23,135 --> 01:00:24,762

- Yes.

I'm sure you know,
but Laird here is the best.

1206

01:03:34,535 --> 01:03:35,786
Mary Pierce, too.

1209
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:38,122
And we believe that Venus
can be bigger than both.

1210
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:40,583
I'm sorry, you, um...

1211
01:03:40,666 --> 01:03:44,128
You said two times already.
You said it's incredible.

1212
01:03:44,211 --> 01:03:45,337
- Yeah.
- And, uh,

1213
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:48,173
why is what we did
so incredible?

1214
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:50,426
Well, I just meant
with your resources,

1215
01:03:50,509 --> 01:03:51,760
and your experiences.

1216
01:03:51,844 --> 01:03:53,429
Richard, I think
all that Laird is saying is

1217
01:03:53,512 --> 01:03:54,972
that you've done an incredible
job with the girls.

1218
01:03:55,055 --> 01:03:56,807
Hold on.
Hold on, Paul.

1219
01:03:56,891 --> 01:04:00,978
That is a full-grown adult man
sitting right there.

1220
01:04:01,061 --> 01:04:03,480
He don't need you to say
what he said.

1221
01:04:03,564 --> 01:04:04,940
If you was gonna say
what he said,

1222
01:04:05,024 --> 01:04:06,150
you could have said it
back at the house.

1223
01:04:06,233 --> 01:04:07,443
We could have saved everybody

1224
01:04:07,526 --> 01:04:09,278
the trouble of coming
to this meeting.

1225
01:04:09,361 --> 01:04:12,448
Now, I asked this man
a simplified question.

1226
01:04:12,531 --> 01:04:15,117
He over-emphasizing
how incredible it is,

1227
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,702
"it's so incredible"
what we did.

1228
01:04:16,785 --> 01:04:18,120
I see all these White kids
around here.

1229
01:04:18,203 --> 01:04:19,622
He ain't saying
how incredible that is.

1230
01:04:19,705 --> 01:04:21,165
Let him answer the question.

1231
01:04:21,248 --> 01:04:22,541
Okay. Let's answer...
That's why we're here.

1232
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,126
Why it's so incredible
what we did?

1233
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:25,502
- Sir, I'm sorry.
- We're here to ask questions.

1234
01:04:25,586 --> 01:04:27,588
I certainly did not mean

1235
01:04:27,671 --> 01:04:29,298
to make any offence there,
Mr. Williams.

1236
01:04:29,381 --> 01:04:31,300
I'm very sorry. I just meant
with your background and...

1237
01:04:31,383 --> 01:04:32,676
Our background.

1238
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,762
Now, of course,
what you mean is our race.

1239
01:04:36,096 --> 01:04:37,514
No, it's okay.
It's okay. I get it.

1240
01:04:37,598 --> 01:04:40,142
You know, little Black girl,
all-White sport.

1241
01:04:40,225 --> 01:04:41,977
That's why we picked tennis.

1242
01:04:42,061 --> 01:04:45,522
Your little, uh,
ghetto Cinderella.

1243
01:04:45,606 --> 01:04:47,816
Your Ghetto-rella.

1244
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,069
Well, that's exactly what
we're talking about, Richard.

1245
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:51,654
We think Venus could be
very inspirational

1246
01:04:51,737 --> 01:04:52,988
to a whole group of people

1247
01:04:53,072 --> 01:04:54,448
who quite honestly,
as an industry,

1248
01:04:54,531 --> 01:04:56,617
we have not done enough
to reach.

1249
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,285
Venus can open a lot of doors.

1250
01:04:58,369 --> 01:04:59,787
And we'd like
to help her do it.

1251
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:02,873
Okay, okay.
So, uh, what're you offering?

1252
01:05:02,957 --> 01:05:06,502
Whatever you need.
Shoes, coaches, rackets.

1253
01:05:06,585 --> 01:05:08,712
Rackets?

1254
01:05:08,796 --> 01:05:10,923
They offering rackets?

1255
01:05:11,006 --> 01:05:12,841
We wouldn't even be sitting
here if you hadn't seen

1256
01:05:12,925 --> 01:05:14,843
what they had done
with their rackets.

1257
01:05:14,927 --> 01:05:16,553
That's true. Fair enough. Yes.

1258
01:05:16,637 --> 01:05:18,013
Come on.
You sure you the best?

1259
01:05:18,097 --> 01:05:19,431
Well, I don't know.
He said it.

1260
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:21,433
Richard, can I be frank?

1261
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:24,311
I think you should be
whoever the hell you wanna be.

1262
01:05:24,395 --> 01:05:26,480
What Venus needs now is
more court time and training.

1263
01:05:26,563 --> 01:05:27,898
The right tournaments
and exposure.

1264
01:05:27,982 --> 01:05:30,567
That's a hundred grand
a year, easy.

1265
01:05:32,152 --> 01:05:33,529
You sign with us

1266
01:05:33,612 --> 01:05:35,990
and we'll help you
carry that burden.

1267
01:05:38,325 --> 01:05:40,869
Let us take it from here.

1268
01:05:40,953 --> 01:05:43,914
Let us make this a sure thing.

1269
01:05:45,332 --> 01:05:48,085
You don't wanna risk all that,
do you, Richard?

1270
01:05:57,136 --> 01:05:58,721
I think I'mma go
get in the pool.

1271
01:05:59,805 --> 01:06:01,098
We'll talk later.

1272
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:05,060
Lovely to meet you.

1273
01:06:07,771 --> 01:06:09,273
What the hell was that?

1274
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:14,486
Okay, here you go.

1275
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:17,698
- Thank you.
- What you all doing?

1276
01:06:17,781 --> 01:06:21,076
- Hey, Daddy. You hungry?
- You want something to eat?

1277
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,828
Where the food
I packed for you?

1278
01:06:22,911 --> 01:06:24,538
Don't worry.
It's all on our tab.

1279
01:06:24,621 --> 01:06:25,622
Mm-hmm.

1280
01:06:25,706 --> 01:06:26,707
It's on your tab?

1281
01:06:26,790 --> 01:06:28,250
It's no big deal, Mr. Williams.

1282
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:29,668
All the food here is for free.

1283
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:32,004
Nothing's for free.
Somebody's paying for it.

1284
01:06:32,087 --> 01:06:33,297
Put it down.

1285
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:35,174
Don't you bite that cookie
one more time.

1286
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:37,009
Put it down.

1287
01:06:37,092 --> 01:06:39,803
Let's go. Get your little tabs
out in the bus.

1288
01:06:41,472 --> 01:06:42,806
- Bye.
- Bye, guys.

1289
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:45,434
- Daddy, what's wrong?
- What's wrong?

1290
01:06:45,517 --> 01:06:46,769
You sitting
at some country club

1291
01:06:46,852 --> 01:06:48,103
with your legs all crossed

1292
01:06:48,187 --> 01:06:50,439
like you Queens of Sheba
from somewhere.

1293
01:06:50,522 --> 01:06:53,150
Never take anything
from anybody for free.

1294
01:06:53,233 --> 01:06:55,652
Everything in this place
got hooks in it.

1295
01:06:56,945 --> 01:06:58,447
No, don't touch us,
Panty-Man!

1296
01:07:02,117 --> 01:07:03,827
- Y'all be careful.
- Hey, girls.

1297
01:07:03,911 --> 01:07:05,454
- Hi, Mr. Cohen.
- Hiya.

1298
01:07:05,537 --> 01:07:06,997
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey, Oracene. How you doing?

1299
01:07:07,081 --> 01:07:08,457
All right. I'll get you
something to drink.

1300
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:10,042
Yeah, sure. That'd be great.

1301
01:07:12,419 --> 01:07:14,505
So what are we doing here,
Richard?

1302
01:07:14,588 --> 01:07:16,673
What the hell was that
back there?

1303
01:07:16,757 --> 01:07:19,760
- Yeah, we not doing this.
- Not doing what?

1304
01:07:19,843 --> 01:07:22,012
We not signing
with none of them agents.

1305
01:07:22,096 --> 01:07:24,014
We not playing
no more Juniors.

1306
01:07:24,098 --> 01:07:26,058
Have you lost your mind?

1307
01:07:26,141 --> 01:07:28,477
Venus is 63-0, okay?

1308
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,479
You pull her out of Juniors
now, you're gonna ruin it.

1309
01:07:30,562 --> 01:07:31,814
Those girls need
to play matches

1310
01:07:31,897 --> 01:07:33,482
or they're gonna die
on the vine.

1311
01:07:33,565 --> 01:07:35,484
Yeah, I done heard the risk,

1312
01:07:35,567 --> 01:07:38,821
but this Junior circuit
is worse than the ghetto.

1313
01:07:40,197 --> 01:07:42,157
Kids out there cracking up,
burning out.

1314
01:07:42,241 --> 01:07:43,659
Their parents
ought to be shot.

1315
01:07:43,742 --> 01:07:46,203
What are you talking about?
Your daughters are fine.

1316
01:07:46,286 --> 01:07:47,830
Oh, yeah,
they fine now.

1317
01:07:47,913 --> 01:07:49,331
But you heard them agents,

1318
01:07:49,414 --> 01:07:50,999
they talking about
pushing them up the ladder.

1319
01:07:51,083 --> 01:07:53,127
Nationals and Internationals.

1320
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:56,672
They don't need
all that pressure. Okay?

1321
01:07:56,755 --> 01:07:59,800
They will play matches
when they turn pro.

1322
01:07:59,883 --> 01:08:01,885
And right now, they need
to just do what they're doing.

1323
01:08:01,969 --> 01:08:03,053
They need to just be kids.

1324
01:08:03,137 --> 01:08:05,055
No, there will be no pros,
Richard.

1325
01:08:05,139 --> 01:08:06,598
And even if there were,

1326
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:08,100
you don't sign with an agent,
how're you guys going

1327
01:08:08,183 --> 01:08:09,226
to afford all their training
till then?

1328
01:08:09,309 --> 01:08:10,185
Yeah. Let me worry about that.

1329
01:08:10,269 --> 01:08:11,311
Did you know about this?

1330
01:08:15,732 --> 01:08:18,694
Richard, don't do this.

1331
01:08:18,777 --> 01:08:21,446
Every American player
who's ever done anything

1332
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:22,906
got good following this path.

1333
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:24,992
Mac, Tracy, Agassi, Pete.

1334
01:08:25,075 --> 01:08:26,368
Yep.

1335
01:08:26,451 --> 01:08:29,663
This window you guys have
is so freaking small.

1336
01:08:29,746 --> 01:08:31,081
- And it will close.
- Yep.

1337
01:08:31,165 --> 01:08:32,416
I know you don't wanna
believe me, but it will.

1338
01:08:32,499 --> 01:08:34,168
Everybody talking
about this window,

1339
01:08:34,251 --> 01:08:36,712
this... this window
they got to get through.

1340
01:08:36,795 --> 01:08:37,963
But peoples like us,

1341
01:08:38,046 --> 01:08:40,048
we... we get shot
when we go through those.

1342
01:08:40,132 --> 01:08:42,968
So I'm thinking we just gonna
pause right here,

1343
01:08:43,051 --> 01:08:44,720
and then
when the time is right,

1344
01:08:44,803 --> 01:08:46,722
we just gonna walk
through the front door.

1345
01:08:48,473 --> 01:08:50,559
Man, I don't understand.

1346
01:08:51,852 --> 01:08:53,353
You do not have a clue.

1347
01:08:53,437 --> 01:08:55,772
You are pissed off because
some guy insulted you today,

1348
01:08:55,856 --> 01:08:58,150
- so now you wanna walk away.
- Mm-mm.

1349
01:08:58,233 --> 01:08:59,776
You are the most
stubborn person

1350
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:01,653
I have ever met in my life.

1351
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:04,573
And I coach McEnroe.

1352
01:09:04,656 --> 01:09:07,075
We appreciate everything
you've done, Paul.

1353
01:09:08,327 --> 01:09:12,915
But this part
of our relationship is done.

1354
01:09:12,998 --> 01:09:14,124
And we will no longer

1355
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:17,169
be requiring your services
any more.

1356
01:09:17,252 --> 01:09:21,048
Richard, no good coach
is gonna take them for free

1357
01:09:21,131 --> 01:09:22,799
if they're
not playing Juniors.

1358
01:09:22,883 --> 01:09:26,261
Yeah, you did. Remember?

1359
01:09:26,345 --> 01:09:28,931
And I think
you're a pretty good coach.

1360
01:09:37,522 --> 01:09:38,857
All right.

1361
01:09:42,361 --> 01:09:44,738
I just pray
you don't screw this up.

1362
01:09:44,821 --> 01:09:46,782
Yeah, we appreciate
your prayers, Paul.

1363
01:09:46,865 --> 01:09:49,117
Mm-hmm.

1364
01:09:49,201 --> 01:09:51,495
Okay, Panty-Man,
we gonna get her!

1365
01:09:51,578 --> 01:09:52,746
Oracene.

1366
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:57,709
Come on,
before Panty-Man gets you.

1367
01:10:04,216 --> 01:10:06,301
- Hey.
- Hey.

1368
01:10:06,385 --> 01:10:08,303
I'll see you
at Wimbledon, kid.

1369
01:10:14,393 --> 01:10:17,020
Are we a team?

1370
01:10:17,104 --> 01:10:18,939
Are we a team? We a...
We a family.

1371
01:10:19,773 --> 01:10:20,983
So we're a team?

1372
01:10:21,066 --> 01:10:22,484
We a family. The best kind
of team there is.

1373
01:10:22,567 --> 01:10:23,902
And you don't think that
that was a decision

1374
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:26,571
that you should have
discussed with me?

1375
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,699
Discussed with Venus?

1376
01:10:28,782 --> 01:10:30,117
- What do you...
- Richard,

1377
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,661
my faith dictates
that I stand by your side.

1378
01:10:32,744 --> 01:10:34,162
All right,
well, just do that then.

1379
01:10:34,246 --> 01:10:36,665
But don't mistake my silence
for agreement.

1380
01:10:36,748 --> 01:10:40,043
You do that again,
and I won't be quiet.

1381
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,587
Now, don't do that.
Don't do that to me.

1382
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,213
You don't make a fool
outta me.

1383
01:10:43,297 --> 01:10:45,173
- Who made a fool outta you?
- You made a fool outta me.

1384
01:10:45,257 --> 01:10:47,843
- What are you talking about?
- Don't make a fool out of me.

1385
01:10:47,926 --> 01:10:50,512
Ain't nobody making
no fool outta you.

1386
01:10:57,561 --> 01:11:00,689
Good feet. Excellent.
Get there. Work!

1387
01:11:00,772 --> 01:11:02,274
Excellent.
I like it. I like it.

1388
01:11:02,357 --> 01:11:04,359
Hey, who's aggressive?
Who wants this point?

1389
01:11:04,443 --> 01:11:05,694
Hey! Rick.

1390
01:11:05,777 --> 01:11:07,571
This guy, Richard Williams,
keeps calling.

1391
01:11:07,654 --> 01:11:08,864
It's like the tenth time
in a row.

1392
01:11:08,947 --> 01:11:10,240
Told me to tell you
it's urgent.

1393
01:11:10,324 --> 01:11:12,534
Urgent? What's so urgent?
His backhand?

1394
01:11:12,618 --> 01:11:13,785
You gotta get that ball.

1395
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:15,746
No, some, uh,
father in California.

1396
01:11:15,829 --> 01:11:17,080
Says he's got two daughters,

1397
01:11:17,164 --> 01:11:18,707
that they're the best
in the state.

1398
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:21,543
Yeah, let me guess,
next Jennifer Capriati?

1399
01:11:21,627 --> 01:11:24,171
These girls so great, how come
I've never heard of 'em?

1400
01:11:24,963 --> 01:11:26,506
They're from Compton.

1401
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:28,133
Compton?

1402
01:11:28,216 --> 01:11:31,053
All right, keep working.
Cuz, it's on you.

1403
01:11:31,136 --> 01:11:32,721
Let's go, guys.

1404
01:11:34,681 --> 01:11:37,517
You guys are late. Let's go.
Move, move, move.

1405
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:40,771
I like that. I like the visor.

1406
01:11:40,854 --> 01:11:42,272
Are you eating that?

1407
01:11:42,356 --> 01:11:43,732
You put crap like that
in your mouth,

1408
01:11:43,815 --> 01:11:45,067
your game's gonna go south.

1409
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:46,860
- Hey, Barry, which line?
- Line two.

1410
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,612
Line two. Okay.

1411
01:11:50,989 --> 01:11:53,325
This is Rick Macci.

1412
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:01,166
He's here! He's here!
He's here! He's here!

1413
01:12:01,249 --> 01:12:02,918
Okay, okay.
Relax, relax.

1414
01:12:03,001 --> 01:12:04,586
Everybody, come on,
get in your position.

1415
01:12:04,669 --> 01:12:05,754
Let's go.

1416
01:12:07,214 --> 01:12:10,008
Mr. Macci.
Welcome, welcome.

1417
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:11,676
Hello, everybody.

1418
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,011
- Hello.
- Hi.

1419
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:15,055
- I'm Richard Williams.
- Mr. Williams.

1420
01:12:15,138 --> 01:12:17,099
- This my wife. This Brandy.
- Hi, it's an honor.

1421
01:12:17,182 --> 01:12:18,850
- We glad to see you.
- It's great to be here.

1422
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:20,227
This is all our kids.
This our family.

1423
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:22,896
That's Venus, Serena,
Tunde, Lyn, Isha.

1424
01:12:22,979 --> 01:12:24,106
- Hello.
- Hi.

1425
01:12:24,189 --> 01:12:25,732
Thank you for coming.

1426
01:12:25,816 --> 01:12:27,067
We know you came a long way,
so we won't waste your time.

1427
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:28,360
You wanna get on
over to the club?

1428
01:12:28,443 --> 01:12:29,653
Let's get it started.

1429
01:12:29,736 --> 01:12:30,862
Let's get it.
Come on, girls, let's go.

1430
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:32,280
Mr. Macci a busy man.

1431
01:12:32,364 --> 01:12:33,782
- All right.
- Be great, be great.

1432
01:12:33,865 --> 01:12:35,534
Come on, y'all,
let's go. Get on in there.

1433
01:12:36,535 --> 01:12:38,078
Grab the door here.

1434
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:41,623
Wow.

1435
01:12:41,706 --> 01:12:45,252
So, uh, tell me one more time,
which one of you is, uh...

1436
01:12:45,335 --> 01:12:47,295
Big one, Venus.
Little one, Serena.

1437
01:12:47,379 --> 01:12:49,923
Okay.
I think I can handle that.

1438
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:55,846
Oh, don't worry about that.
You don't need that.

1439
01:13:00,058 --> 01:13:01,268
Bye, guys!

1440
01:13:05,272 --> 01:13:07,149
We got Rick Macci
in Compton!

1441
01:13:09,234 --> 01:13:11,361
Good. There you go, Meka.

1442
01:13:11,445 --> 01:13:13,321
Take that. And that.

1443
01:13:13,405 --> 01:13:14,656
Close her down, Richard?

1444
01:13:14,739 --> 01:13:16,867
Uh, yeah,
you can just close it up.

1445
01:13:24,291 --> 01:13:25,542
Hey, hey, hey!

1446
01:13:25,625 --> 01:13:28,462
Slow down, haircut.
Hell you think you going?

1447
01:13:30,338 --> 01:13:33,133
Oh. Just gonna
play some tennis.

1448
01:13:33,216 --> 01:13:34,509
Hey, yo, Richard,

1449
01:13:34,593 --> 01:13:36,553
this Jimmy Connors-looking
cracker with you?

1450
01:13:36,636 --> 01:13:38,555
Uh, yeah, yeah.
White boy with us.

1451
01:13:38,638 --> 01:13:40,015
All right, it's spoke.

1452
01:13:40,098 --> 01:13:41,641
- Yeah, he just White.
- It's spoke.

1453
01:13:41,725 --> 01:13:43,351
Amen.

1454
01:13:43,435 --> 01:13:44,686
Get up out of here.

1455
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:46,021
I ain't gonna
let you get shot, Rick.

1456
01:13:46,104 --> 01:13:47,314
Appreciate it.

1457
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:51,401
- This is it, huh?
- This it.

1458
01:13:51,485 --> 01:13:53,153
Compton Country Club.

1459
01:13:54,488 --> 01:13:56,323
Really good,
really good, really good.

1460
01:13:58,575 --> 01:14:01,036
They ain't gonna hit you.
They ain't gonna hit you.

1461
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:02,621
<i>Go get it. Forehand.</i>

1462
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:04,956
Pop. Excellent. Backhand.

1463
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,124
Attagirl, go!

1464
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:07,584
Move. Fast feet.
Good recovery.

1465
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:08,752
Excellent. Recover.

1466
01:14:09,753 --> 01:14:11,713
Wheels, wheels, recover. Go!

1467
01:14:12,839 --> 01:14:14,925
Good! Again!

1468
01:14:15,008 --> 01:14:17,469
Hey, I like it.
Find the slot, rip the shot.

1469
01:14:17,552 --> 01:14:18,887
- That's Rick Macci.
- Again.

1470
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:20,514
Where you get that power from?

1471
01:14:20,597 --> 01:14:21,932
Macci rhyme with crazy.

1472
01:14:22,015 --> 01:14:23,391
I'm sorry,
was it something I said?

1473
01:14:23,475 --> 01:14:25,101
I think it's the 'stache.
I think she doesn't like

1474
01:14:25,185 --> 01:14:26,895
the guy with the 'stache.
Get there.

1475
01:14:26,978 --> 01:14:29,064
I love it. Come on in
for the approach.

1476
01:14:30,023 --> 01:14:32,526
Yes! Come on. Get there.

1477
01:14:32,609 --> 01:14:34,236
What do you say?
Fight it like you're angry.

1478
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:35,946
Oh, I like it! Excellent work.

1479
01:14:36,029 --> 01:14:38,532
Hey, girls. Hey.
I love what you're doing.

1480
01:14:38,615 --> 01:14:40,033
- Excellent job.
- There you go.

1481
01:14:40,116 --> 01:14:42,244
Put it right there.
Did you guys have fun?

1482
01:14:42,327 --> 01:14:44,704
- Yeah.
- Good. Good, good. I like it.

1483
01:14:44,788 --> 01:14:46,748
That father of yours,
he's done a heck of a job,

1484
01:14:46,831 --> 01:14:48,750
so, uh, this was a lot of fun
for me too.

1485
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:50,794
So, thank you, girls.
Thank you.

1486
01:14:50,877 --> 01:14:53,547
Richard, I'm, uh...
I'm impressed.

1487
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:56,091
Y'all go get
some water. Get some water.

1488
01:14:56,174 --> 01:14:59,094
They're, uh...
They're terrific, I think.

1489
01:14:59,177 --> 01:15:00,428
I think you might just have

1490
01:15:00,512 --> 01:15:02,347
the next Michael Jordan
on your hands.

1491
01:15:02,430 --> 01:15:04,140
Oh, no, brother-man,

1492
01:15:04,224 --> 01:15:06,768
I gots me the next two.

1493
01:15:08,395 --> 01:15:10,313
I like the way you think.

1494
01:15:10,397 --> 01:15:14,109
This here,
this is my standard agreement.

1495
01:15:14,192 --> 01:15:17,279
Same one I used with Jennifer.
All right.

1496
01:15:17,362 --> 01:15:19,614
Instruction, housing,
food, education.

1497
01:15:19,698 --> 01:15:21,283
You don't pay for a thing.

1498
01:15:21,366 --> 01:15:24,869
Even trips to Disney World,
which is right down the road.

1499
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:27,581
But mostly, it's...
It's my personal time.

1500
01:15:27,664 --> 01:15:29,207
Now, that I promise
you will get.

1501
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,793
You train at Rick Macci,
hey, you're...

1502
01:15:31,877 --> 01:15:33,128
you're gonna train with Rick.

1503
01:15:33,211 --> 01:15:35,213
Sounds expensive.
What's in it for you?

1504
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:38,091
My fee is 15%
of their future earnings.

1505
01:15:38,174 --> 01:15:40,135
If you make nothing,
I make nothing.

1506
01:15:40,218 --> 01:15:42,304
But, uh,
I can tell you one thing,

1507
01:15:42,387 --> 01:15:44,139
we are not gonna make nothing.

1508
01:15:45,473 --> 01:15:47,225
What you know
about Nick Bollettieri?

1509
01:15:49,352 --> 01:15:51,521
He a real famous, uh,
tennis coach.

1510
01:15:51,605 --> 01:15:53,064
Sure.

1511
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:55,233
The boy keep calling here.
Can't get him off the phone.

1512
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,360
Yeah, Nick is a...
He's a good coach.

1513
01:15:57,444 --> 01:16:00,697
You know, he's had
a lot of success, but, uh...

1514
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:02,616
I can tell you now,
you go down to Bradenton

1515
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:04,326
to train with Nick,
you're not gonna get Nick.

1516
01:16:04,409 --> 01:16:05,660
You're gonna get
whatever hitting coach

1517
01:16:05,744 --> 01:16:06,703
he's got available.

1518
01:16:06,786 --> 01:16:08,747
You're gonna get a factory.

1519
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:10,624
Now, you train with me,
I'm your coach. It's me.

1520
01:16:10,707 --> 01:16:12,083
A lot of people say
Nick the best.

1521
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:14,002
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

1522
01:16:14,085 --> 01:16:15,378
Remember that man
who said that?

1523
01:16:15,462 --> 01:16:17,213
- Mm-hmm.
- Mr. and Mrs. Williams,

1524
01:16:17,297 --> 01:16:19,174
whether it's Nick or Rick...

1525
01:16:19,257 --> 01:16:20,675
Tom, Dick, or Harry,
it doesn't matter.

1526
01:16:20,759 --> 01:16:22,719
If it's their dream
to be a champion,

1527
01:16:22,802 --> 01:16:24,012
well, then you got a chance.

1528
01:16:24,095 --> 01:16:25,680
But, you know,
if it's yours, mine, no.

1529
01:16:25,764 --> 01:16:28,350
Crash and burn.
It's not gonna happen.

1530
01:16:28,433 --> 01:16:30,477
So, you wanna go with Nick,

1531
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,354
you know,
you gotta go with Nick.

1532
01:16:32,437 --> 01:16:33,438
That's your prerogative.

1533
01:16:33,521 --> 01:16:34,773
No, we wanna go with you.

1534
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:36,149
Oh.

1535
01:16:36,232 --> 01:16:37,984
Thank heavens.
I was...

1536
01:16:38,068 --> 01:16:39,736
We just wanted to hear you say
what you had said.

1537
01:16:39,819 --> 01:16:41,071
Well, well done.

1538
01:16:41,154 --> 01:16:43,406
Whew!

1539
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:45,992
- Hey, Tunde. Uh...
- Wow.

1540
01:16:46,076 --> 01:16:48,703
Now, this here
is our standard agreement.

1541
01:16:48,787 --> 01:16:51,247
I'm sorry, your...

1542
01:16:51,331 --> 01:16:53,083
You know,
you take these girls,

1543
01:16:53,166 --> 01:16:55,210
you take us all,
the whole family.

1544
01:16:57,128 --> 01:17:00,382
I'm sorry, you...
You all wanna come to Florida?

1545
01:17:00,465 --> 01:17:01,758
Not Tunde.

1546
01:17:01,841 --> 01:17:04,386
She just graduated
valedictorian.

1547
01:17:04,469 --> 01:17:06,137
So, her life is here.

1548
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:07,931
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

1549
01:17:08,014 --> 01:17:10,058
Yeah, but all that other stuff
that's in that contract,

1550
01:17:10,141 --> 01:17:11,393
we need that.

1551
01:17:11,476 --> 01:17:13,061
Uh, we need a house,
we need the best school,

1552
01:17:13,144 --> 01:17:16,564
and, uh, a job for me
on your staff.

1553
01:17:16,648 --> 01:17:19,317
It says here, a...
a mobile home?

1554
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:21,903
Yeah, I mean, we got
to get there, don't we?

1555
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,989
You believe in these kids
or what?

1556
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:27,867
You bet I do.

1557
01:17:27,951 --> 01:17:29,786
I swear to you two.
You bet I do.

1558
01:17:29,869 --> 01:17:31,538
Okay, then why are we
still sitting here?

1559
01:17:31,621 --> 01:17:33,456
- We supposed to be in Florida.
- What are we doing?

1560
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:34,708
Let's go to Florida.

1561
01:17:46,761 --> 01:17:49,013
No, 'cause you always
take the longest.

1562
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,265
Oh, thank you.

1563
01:17:50,348 --> 01:17:51,599
Y'all,
can you get me one?

1564
01:17:51,683 --> 01:17:53,017
Here you go.
No, we can share that.

1565
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:54,644
- We can share now.
- Give me one.

1566
01:17:54,728 --> 01:17:55,812
No. 'Cause y'all
wouldn't let me sit with you.

1567
01:17:55,895 --> 01:17:57,105
Keep your hands...

1568
01:17:57,188 --> 01:17:58,440
You keep your hand
on that wheel.

1569
01:17:58,523 --> 01:17:59,816
She got it.
Do you need me, Junior?

1570
01:17:59,899 --> 01:18:01,192
- No, I got it.
- Put one hand,

1571
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:02,485
at least one hand
on that wheel. Something.

1572
01:18:02,569 --> 01:18:03,987
What's up?
Hey, police.

1573
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:05,405
- Hi, police!
- We were just

1574
01:18:05,488 --> 01:18:07,157
breaking the law. Sorry.

1575
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:10,118
- Okay, spell "Albuquerque."
- Albuquerque.

1576
01:18:10,201 --> 01:18:13,872
A-L-B-U-Q...

1577
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:15,081
- No.
- Yeah.

1578
01:18:15,165 --> 01:18:16,374
Can't be L-R.

1579
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:18,543
- It started...
- A-L...

1580
01:18:18,626 --> 01:18:20,295
- The word got, like...
- A-L-B-U-Q...

1581
01:18:20,378 --> 01:18:21,546
...it got, like, three Q's.

1582
01:18:21,629 --> 01:18:23,256
No, don't tell 'em.
Let 'em do it.

1583
01:19:05,715 --> 01:19:07,467
Look at that.
We in Florida.

1584
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:08,843
So pretty!

1585
01:19:08,927 --> 01:19:10,011
There you go.
Welcome to Florida.

1586
01:19:12,055 --> 01:19:13,556
Rick Macci,
here we come.

1587
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:15,642
Rick Macci,
there we go.

1588
01:19:24,734 --> 01:19:25,860
There they are.

1589
01:19:25,944 --> 01:19:27,362
- Hi.
- Wow, look at that.

1590
01:19:27,445 --> 01:19:30,824
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to the Sunshine State.

1591
01:19:30,907 --> 01:19:32,575
Gosh, it's great
to see you guys.

1592
01:19:32,659 --> 01:19:33,910
How was the trip? Was it good?

1593
01:19:33,993 --> 01:19:35,119
Yeah. It was long.

1594
01:19:35,203 --> 01:19:36,663
Long?
Yeah, I bet it was.

1595
01:19:36,746 --> 01:19:38,331
It wasn't long.
It was not long.

1596
01:19:38,414 --> 01:19:39,999
Richard, do you see
that blue bad boy right there?

1597
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:41,417
- Mm-hmm.
- I call it the Comet.

1598
01:19:41,501 --> 01:19:42,585
I like to ride around,

1599
01:19:42,669 --> 01:19:44,087
makes me feel like
I own the place.

1600
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:46,089
Which is crazy 'cause,
you know, I kinda do.

1601
01:19:46,172 --> 01:19:47,423
That gonna be mine.

1602
01:19:47,507 --> 01:19:48,925
- That gonna be mine.
- Now, girls,

1603
01:19:49,008 --> 01:19:50,385
these are the drilling courts.
That's Tommy Ho.

1604
01:19:50,468 --> 01:19:51,845
He won the U.S.
Junior Nationals at 15.

1605
01:19:51,928 --> 01:19:53,513
He's top 50 in the country.

1606
01:19:53,596 --> 01:19:55,765
That's Eric Taino.
That's John Roddick.

1607
01:19:55,849 --> 01:19:57,308
They're both top five
in the country

1608
01:19:57,392 --> 01:19:58,768
right now for their age group.

1609
01:19:58,852 --> 01:19:59,978
Now, John, he's got

1610
01:20:00,061 --> 01:20:01,521
- a little brother.
- Yeah, he's good.

1611
01:20:01,604 --> 01:20:02,689
His name's Andy.
That kid is a savage.

1612
01:20:02,772 --> 01:20:03,857
He breathes fire. He's good.

1613
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:05,316
Wait till I get
my hands on him.

1614
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,734
This is it right here.
Let's go.

1615
01:20:06,818 --> 01:20:08,486
Dig, dig, dig, dig. Feet.

1616
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:09,779
You hear that sound?

1617
01:20:09,863 --> 01:20:11,447
That sound is effort.
I love effort.

1618
01:20:11,531 --> 01:20:13,992
That's my happy place.
Come with me.

1619
01:20:14,075 --> 01:20:15,660
This is where we eat.

1620
01:20:15,743 --> 01:20:17,412
Hey, guys, don't eat too many
of these things, all right?

1621
01:20:17,495 --> 01:20:19,581
This will give you horns.

1622
01:20:19,664 --> 01:20:20,999
Best French fries in Florida.

1623
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:22,542
Now, look, this place
will always be open

1624
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:23,877
and available to you guys.

1625
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:25,169
You help yourselves
whenever you want.

1626
01:20:25,253 --> 01:20:26,713
All right, good,
'cause I'm hungry.

1627
01:20:26,796 --> 01:20:28,381
For real? We just ate.

1628
01:20:28,464 --> 01:20:29,674
You got some place here, Rick.

1629
01:20:29,757 --> 01:20:31,301
And it just got
a lot better today.

1630
01:20:31,384 --> 01:20:33,094
Come on, Richard, let's go.

1631
01:20:33,177 --> 01:20:34,596
Over here.
Look at 'em walking off.

1632
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:37,056
Try the cinnamon rolls.
They're first class.

1633
01:20:38,308 --> 01:20:39,434
What you got over there?

1634
01:20:39,517 --> 01:20:41,436
That's the chum?

1635
01:20:41,519 --> 01:20:43,438
Yeah, you know,
you got a good eye, Richard.

1636
01:20:43,521 --> 01:20:45,273
- Mm-hmm.
- You know how that works.

1637
01:20:45,356 --> 01:20:48,276
You need a few cheeseburgers
to pay for the sirloin.

1638
01:20:48,359 --> 01:20:49,777
You sell enough sirloin,

1639
01:20:49,861 --> 01:20:50,987
you can get
to the filet mignon.

1640
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:52,906
Oh, there you go.

1641
01:20:52,989 --> 01:20:55,533
Here we are, girls.
This is Mecca.

1642
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:58,119
These two courts here,
they're yours.

1643
01:20:58,203 --> 01:21:00,288
Just you and me
and the best pros we got.

1644
01:21:00,371 --> 01:21:02,790
This is where we hit the horn,
we pop the corn,

1645
01:21:02,874 --> 01:21:05,793
and when we pop it, we pop
with extra butter, right?

1646
01:21:05,877 --> 01:21:06,961
- Right.
- Huh? You feel me?

1647
01:21:07,045 --> 01:21:08,338
- Yep.
- Yeah? Bang.

1648
01:21:08,421 --> 01:21:09,505
- Bang.
- Right? Bang.

1649
01:21:09,589 --> 01:21:10,798
Bang.

1650
01:21:10,882 --> 01:21:12,425
Now, look, I got
a little surprise for you.

1651
01:21:12,508 --> 01:21:15,720
This won't happen every day,
but since she's here,

1652
01:21:15,803 --> 01:21:18,514
I thought maybe
you'd wanna hit a little bit.

1653
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:20,808
Jennifer!

1654
01:21:20,892 --> 01:21:21,976
Oh, look.

1655
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:24,395
- That Jennifer Capriati.
- Hey.

1656
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:27,190
I hear you guys can play.
You wanna hit?

1657
01:21:27,273 --> 01:21:28,399
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1658
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:29,817
- Can we?
- Oh, yeah.

1659
01:21:29,901 --> 01:21:31,194
You girls just take it easy
on her though.

1660
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:34,364
- Let's go, Meka.
- Have fun, girls.

1661
01:21:34,447 --> 01:21:36,532
This is
really special. Have fun.

1662
01:21:36,616 --> 01:21:37,825
This is special
for her, too.

1663
01:21:37,909 --> 01:21:39,661
I told her
all about the girls,

1664
01:21:39,744 --> 01:21:41,120
and she wanted to meet Venus,
so, yeah.

1665
01:21:41,204 --> 01:21:42,872
Yeah, you know
how to throw a party.

1666
01:21:44,123 --> 01:21:45,458
Well, it's good
you guys are here.

1667
01:21:45,541 --> 01:21:47,252
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey, girls.

1668
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:49,504
All right, girls,
let's go. Warm up slow.

1669
01:21:49,587 --> 01:21:50,838
Just have fun.

1670
01:21:50,922 --> 01:21:52,924
Look at that.
That's gotta be

1671
01:21:53,007 --> 01:21:54,676
- special for her, huh?
- Yeah.

1672
01:21:54,759 --> 01:21:57,053
- She looks strong.
- She is. She is.

1673
01:21:57,136 --> 01:21:58,888
- A lot of work she's put in.
- Mm-hmm.

1674
01:21:58,972 --> 01:22:00,056
So, she's gonna
get there.

1675
01:22:00,139 --> 01:22:02,183
V's gonna get there.

1676
01:22:02,266 --> 01:22:05,186
That's it. Attagirl.
Good. I like it.

1677
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:08,356
I mean, look at that.
That's the model right there.

1678
01:22:08,439 --> 01:22:10,942
Now, I figure we mold her
in Jennifer's path.

1679
01:22:11,025 --> 01:22:13,236
We start with the Easter Bowl,
then the Orange Bowl,

1680
01:22:13,319 --> 01:22:14,445
just like how Jennifer did it,

1681
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:15,863
- right?
- Yeah.

1682
01:22:15,947 --> 01:22:17,657
They're good tournaments,
they're challenging.

1683
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:20,618
I'm thinking we not gonna play
the Easter Bowl though, Rick.

1684
01:22:20,702 --> 01:22:23,746
Okay, well, you got
another tournament in mind?

1685
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,125
No, uh,

1686
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:28,459
I meant to tell you, uh,

1687
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:30,962
we not playing
no more Juniors.

1688
01:22:31,045 --> 01:22:34,257
Yeah, they'll play matches
again when they turn pro.

1689
01:22:35,299 --> 01:22:36,884
Okay.

1690
01:22:36,968 --> 01:22:39,345
And when exactly is that
gonna be, Richard?

1691
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:42,473
When I say they ready.

1692
01:22:42,557 --> 01:22:43,599
We're not gonna
rush this, Rick.

1693
01:22:43,683 --> 01:22:44,767
Everything going good.

1694
01:22:44,851 --> 01:22:46,978
We not gonna
start rushing now.

1695
01:22:47,061 --> 01:22:48,730
What are they gonna do,
Richard?

1696
01:22:48,813 --> 01:22:50,231
They gonna play ping-pong?

1697
01:22:50,314 --> 01:22:51,899
No, no.
They gonna practice with you.

1698
01:22:51,983 --> 01:22:54,610
They gonna go to school,
they gonna go to the Hall,

1699
01:22:54,694 --> 01:22:56,487
and pretty much,
they gonna be kids.

1700
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:57,572
That's what I want.

1701
01:22:57,655 --> 01:22:59,032
They're gonna be kids?

1702
01:22:59,115 --> 01:23:01,743
But, Richard, that's...
That is not how it works.

1703
01:23:01,826 --> 01:23:03,745
I... I... I can't do that.

1704
01:23:03,828 --> 01:23:05,455
I can't mold her like that.

1705
01:23:05,538 --> 01:23:06,706
You need to play Juniors.

1706
01:23:06,789 --> 01:23:08,249
Look, there's not
a single player,

1707
01:23:08,332 --> 01:23:10,501
not one on the pro tour,
that didn't play Juniors.

1708
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:12,962
Without Juniors,
it's impossible.

1709
01:23:13,046 --> 01:23:16,424
Well, not for you.
Not for you. You Rick Macci.

1710
01:23:16,507 --> 01:23:18,051
That's why we drove
all this way.

1711
01:23:18,134 --> 01:23:21,471
Nothing is impossible
for Rick Macci.

1712
01:23:21,554 --> 01:23:22,680
But if you think
you can't do it,

1713
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:24,891
we... we can go talk to Nick.

1714
01:23:28,061 --> 01:23:31,397
You know, you might have
mentioned this in Compton.

1715
01:23:31,481 --> 01:23:32,899
I probably could have,

1716
01:23:32,982 --> 01:23:34,317
but then
you wouldn't have made

1717
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,111
the best decision
you ever made in your life.

1718
01:23:38,905 --> 01:23:40,573
This is great, Rick.

1719
01:23:40,656 --> 01:23:42,867
Oh, and I need 'em hitting
open-stance strokes.

1720
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:44,452
That's one of the things.
That's the most important.

1721
01:23:44,535 --> 01:23:46,287
They got to hit
them open-stance strokes.

1722
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:47,747
We gonna make it go "boom"
like you said.

1723
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:49,040
- Remember?
- Right.

1724
01:23:49,123 --> 01:23:50,792
- Make it go boom.
- Yeah, I said "bang,"

1725
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:52,251
- but, yeah.
- You said, "bang," "boom,"

1726
01:23:52,335 --> 01:23:53,669
we gonna make 'em
make some noise.

1727
01:23:53,753 --> 01:23:55,129
I got to get the family.
They need to see this.

1728
01:23:55,213 --> 01:23:56,297
I'mma grab a burger.
You want something?

1729
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:59,050
Nah. I don't want a burger.

1730
01:23:59,133 --> 01:24:00,968
Don't be scared, Rick.
I wrote the plan.

1731
01:24:01,052 --> 01:24:02,762
Oh, God, the plan.

1732
01:24:06,224 --> 01:24:08,309
All right, Venus, serve it up.

1733
01:24:22,573 --> 01:24:25,076
Good! Hey, look at that.

1734
01:24:25,159 --> 01:24:27,328
Boom! I like it.
How about that?

1735
01:24:27,411 --> 01:24:28,496
Bang!

1736
01:24:28,579 --> 01:24:30,039
Come on, get in there and dig!

1737
01:24:30,123 --> 01:24:31,666
Kill it. I like it. Good.

1738
01:24:31,749 --> 01:24:33,417
Good, good. Hey, listen.

1739
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:35,711
That wasn't a good shot
at the end. You know why?

1740
01:24:35,795 --> 01:24:37,421
- It was excellent.
- 'Cause it was excellent.

1741
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:40,049
Good. Hey, I'm proud of ya.
Excellent work.

1742
01:24:40,133 --> 01:24:41,342
Let's go.
I'll race you to the water.

1743
01:24:41,426 --> 01:24:42,927
You've faced
a lot of criticism

1744
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:44,512
in the last three years since
you pulled your daughters

1745
01:24:44,595 --> 01:24:45,972
out of
Junior tournament tennis.

1746
01:24:46,055 --> 01:24:47,098
- Mm-hmm.
- You've been called

1747
01:24:47,181 --> 01:24:49,100
controversial, overbearing,

1748
01:24:49,183 --> 01:24:51,811
- a self-promoting distraction.
- Mm-hmm.

1749
01:24:51,894 --> 01:24:53,896
How do you respond
to all that?

1750
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:55,481
Well, look, peoples gonna say

1751
01:24:55,565 --> 01:24:56,899
what peoples gonna say,
you know.

1752
01:24:56,983 --> 01:24:58,192
When somebody come to me,

1753
01:24:58,276 --> 01:24:59,735
telling me my daughter so good

1754
01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:02,530
and she, you know, she need
to be playing matches,

1755
01:25:02,613 --> 01:25:04,782
I know the only reason
they see good

1756
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:06,409
is 'cause they see money.

1757
01:25:06,492 --> 01:25:07,910
And most of the time,

1758
01:25:07,994 --> 01:25:09,829
they see money that can be
going into they pocket.

1759
01:25:09,912 --> 01:25:11,998
But you've certainly said
a lot of provocative things.

1760
01:25:12,081 --> 01:25:13,499
- Mm-hmm.
- You've said "tennis parents

1761
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:14,876
- "should be shot."
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

1762
01:25:14,959 --> 01:25:16,752
You said you're brokering
a deal to purchase

1763
01:25:16,836 --> 01:25:19,172
- Rockefeller Center.
- Yep.

1764
01:25:19,255 --> 01:25:21,883
Well, truth is, I got
so many businesses now,

1765
01:25:21,966 --> 01:25:23,718
I hardly even think
about tennis.

1766
01:25:23,801 --> 01:25:25,970
And you're not concerned
all that's holding them back?

1767
01:25:26,053 --> 01:25:27,638
Most top prospects their age,

1768
01:25:27,722 --> 01:25:29,390
like Martina Hingis,
for example,

1769
01:25:29,473 --> 01:25:30,975
- are about to turn pro.
- Yeah.

1770
01:25:31,058 --> 01:25:34,437
But your daughters haven't
played a match since 1991.

1771
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:36,647
Well, we still
pushing 'em forward.

1772
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:39,317
Venus speaking four languages.

1773
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,736
Most of 'em fluently, almost.

1774
01:25:41,819 --> 01:25:43,654
How many languages you speak?

1775
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:47,033
Exactly. Not even
really good at this one.

1776
01:25:47,116 --> 01:25:49,160
Look, I've been broke
all my life,

1777
01:25:49,243 --> 01:25:52,079
and Venus don't wanna be poor,
you know.

1778
01:25:52,163 --> 01:25:54,081
But we not gonna let
nobody push our daughter

1779
01:25:54,165 --> 01:25:56,083
into nothing
she ain't ready for.

1780
01:25:57,585 --> 01:25:58,711
Okay, all right,

1781
01:25:58,794 --> 01:26:00,338
- so, I'mma get Venus.
- Thank you.

1782
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:02,131
Uh, y'all can go ahead
and move and set up up top.

1783
01:26:02,215 --> 01:26:03,841
- Okay.
- Fast feet. Fast feet.

1784
01:26:03,925 --> 01:26:05,426
Fast feet.
Good. Here they come.

1785
01:26:05,509 --> 01:26:07,136
Here's it come. You don't know
when it's coming.

1786
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:09,055
Let's go. You don't know.
Go! React.

1787
01:26:09,138 --> 01:26:10,848
Good! I like it.
Let's go. Move.

1788
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:12,892
Yes, like a bullet.
Yes, I like it!

1789
01:26:12,975 --> 01:26:14,727
Boom, that's major league.
Let's go. Fast feet.

1790
01:26:14,810 --> 01:26:16,103
- Fast feet. Keep 'em moving.
- Junior!

1791
01:26:16,187 --> 01:26:17,605
When you're moving,
I'm grooving.

1792
01:26:17,688 --> 01:26:19,065
- Good. Get there.
- Junior!

1793
01:26:19,148 --> 01:26:22,485
You got an interview.
Come on, let's go.

1794
01:26:22,568 --> 01:26:26,113
Come on.
Hey, V, we got two more hours.

1795
01:26:26,197 --> 01:26:27,615
Hey, look,
I'm telling you now,

1796
01:26:27,698 --> 01:26:29,408
you leave this court,
your sister's taking over.

1797
01:26:29,492 --> 01:26:31,035
Sorry, Rick, it's showtime.

1798
01:26:31,118 --> 01:26:33,746
Yeah, it's always showtime,
isn't it, Richard?

1799
01:26:34,705 --> 01:26:36,123
Hey, Meek, let's go.

1800
01:26:36,207 --> 01:26:38,334
I know someone
wants to be here.

1801
01:26:38,417 --> 01:26:40,253
<i>Do you wanna turn pro?</i>

1802
01:26:40,336 --> 01:26:41,462
Yes.

1803
01:26:41,545 --> 01:26:42,838
A lot of people
are excited to see

1804
01:26:42,922 --> 01:26:45,383
how you'd do
against players like Seles.

1805
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:47,635
Do you think you can beat her?

1806
01:26:47,718 --> 01:26:49,136
I know I could beat her.

1807
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:52,723
You know you can beat her?
Very confident.

1808
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:54,100
I'm very confident.

1809
01:26:55,142 --> 01:26:58,437
You say it so easily. Why?

1810
01:26:59,897 --> 01:27:01,357
Because I believe it.

1811
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,484
But you haven't played a match
in almost three years.

1812
01:27:03,567 --> 01:27:05,278
All right,
hold it right there.

1813
01:27:05,361 --> 01:27:06,904
If you don't mind,
lemme tell you why.

1814
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:08,739
Richard,
we're doing an interview.

1815
01:27:08,823 --> 01:27:10,241
Well, what she had said,

1816
01:27:10,324 --> 01:27:12,827
she said it with so much
confidence the first time,

1817
01:27:12,910 --> 01:27:14,161
but you keep going on and on.

1818
01:27:14,245 --> 01:27:15,663
But you can't
just keep interrupting.

1819
01:27:15,746 --> 01:27:17,498
What you gots to understand
is you're dealing

1820
01:27:17,581 --> 01:27:20,209
with the image
of a 14-year-old child.

1821
01:27:20,293 --> 01:27:21,669
And this child
gonna be playing

1822
01:27:21,752 --> 01:27:24,797
when your old ass and me
gonna be in the grave.

1823
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:25,923
When she had said something,

1824
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:27,258
we done told you
what's happening.

1825
01:27:27,341 --> 01:27:29,885
You are dealing
with a little Black kid.

1826
01:27:29,969 --> 01:27:31,262
Let her be a kid.

1827
01:27:31,345 --> 01:27:33,264
Now, she done answered it
with a lot of confidence.

1828
01:27:33,347 --> 01:27:35,308
Leave that alone!

1829
01:27:38,311 --> 01:27:40,229
Focus. That's it.
It's all about your eyes.

1830
01:27:40,313 --> 01:27:42,732
Focus. Right there.
Good. Turn it over.

1831
01:27:42,815 --> 01:27:44,775
Good. Sharp. Again.

1832
01:27:44,859 --> 01:27:48,112
Again. Sharp. Let's go.
One, two, right there.

1833
01:27:48,195 --> 01:27:50,698
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1834
01:27:50,781 --> 01:27:52,992
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1835
01:27:53,075 --> 01:27:54,994
Let's go. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Fast feet.

1836
01:27:55,077 --> 01:27:56,537
What's going on, Shakespeare?

1837
01:27:56,620 --> 01:27:57,872
Good.

1838
01:27:57,955 --> 01:27:59,832
- Did you get the part?
- Yeah, it was good.

1839
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:02,918
Rick, what's going on
over there?

1840
01:28:03,002 --> 01:28:05,546
Eh, big Junior tournament's
coming up.

1841
01:28:05,629 --> 01:28:08,299
The Continental Cup.
Hoopla's for Kournikova.

1842
01:28:08,382 --> 01:28:09,425
She's getting
some practice in.

1843
01:28:09,508 --> 01:28:10,885
Again. Go take a break.

1844
01:28:10,968 --> 01:28:12,386
I heard she's going pro
next month in Russia.

1845
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:15,014
- Hingis announced, too.
- Yeah, they, uh...

1846
01:28:15,097 --> 01:28:16,015
They are.

1847
01:28:16,098 --> 01:28:18,017
But look, Russia's overrated.

1848
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:19,935
The weather's lousy,
the food's terrible...

1849
01:28:20,019 --> 01:28:21,979
But, Rick, I wanna play.

1850
01:28:22,063 --> 01:28:23,939
Sweetheart, you're preaching
to the choir, okay?

1851
01:28:24,023 --> 01:28:25,900
- Do you think I'm ready?
- No, I know you're ready.

1852
01:28:25,983 --> 01:28:27,985
Okay, will you talk to my dad?

1853
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:29,737
- Sweetheart, look...
- Come on, Rick, please.

1854
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:31,155
You're trying to feed me
to the wolves here.

1855
01:28:31,238 --> 01:28:32,406
I'm ready. You know I'm ready.

1856
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:33,657
Look, I've been
down this road...

1857
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:35,701
Rick, just talk to him.
Please.

1858
01:28:35,785 --> 01:28:36,911
Eh...

1859
01:28:36,994 --> 01:28:38,287
Please?

1860
01:28:38,371 --> 01:28:39,622
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

1861
01:28:39,705 --> 01:28:41,123
Is that a yes?

1862
01:28:41,207 --> 01:28:42,917
It's that face.
It's your face.

1863
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,043
It's like I can't...

1864
01:28:44,126 --> 01:28:45,086
- So, yes?
- You give me the face...

1865
01:28:45,169 --> 01:28:46,295
- Yes, yes.
- Yes!

1866
01:28:46,379 --> 01:28:47,546
All right,
all right, all right.

1867
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:49,215
- Yes!
- Oh, boy. Here we go.

1868
01:28:49,298 --> 01:28:50,758
- Let's just...
- It's a yes.

1869
01:28:50,841 --> 01:28:52,343
...hope he doesn't actually
kill the messenger.

1870
01:28:52,426 --> 01:28:54,428
- He said yeah?
- He said yes.

1871
01:28:54,512 --> 01:28:55,763
Jesus.

1872
01:28:55,846 --> 01:28:58,391
Think fast. Put those on,
train your sister.

1873
01:28:58,474 --> 01:28:59,642
I need a break to figure out

1874
01:28:59,725 --> 01:29:01,227
how I'm gonna talk
to this maniac.

1875
01:29:01,310 --> 01:29:03,104
- Let's go. Put your gloves on.
- Let's go.

1876
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,148
The main reason
we not rushing,

1877
01:29:06,232 --> 01:29:09,443
'cause without an education,
no matter how good you are,

1878
01:29:09,527 --> 01:29:11,445
by the time they 18,
they gonna be broke,

1879
01:29:11,529 --> 01:29:13,823
then have 50 more years
to live like a fool.

1880
01:29:13,906 --> 01:29:15,282
We not doing that.

1881
01:29:15,366 --> 01:29:16,951
- Oh, look at that.
- What's going on, everybody?

1882
01:29:17,034 --> 01:29:18,786
- There's Rick Macci.
- Kids, where...

1883
01:29:18,869 --> 01:29:21,789
Rick own everything you see
as far as you can see.

1884
01:29:21,872 --> 01:29:23,416
True. Hey, Richard,

1885
01:29:23,499 --> 01:29:26,168
do you think I could, um,
bend your ear for a minute?

1886
01:29:26,252 --> 01:29:27,711
Oh, yeah, yeah,
sure thing.

1887
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:29,755
Uh, girls, take the kids on
down to the court.

1888
01:29:29,839 --> 01:29:31,298
I'll meet you down there.

1889
01:29:31,382 --> 01:29:32,216
You can go on with them.
I'll talk to you in a second.

1890
01:29:32,299 --> 01:29:33,217
Okay. Thank you.

1891
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:34,802
Rick got that look on his face

1892
01:29:34,885 --> 01:29:36,387
like he need
to say something to me

1893
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:37,888
that I'm not gonna wanna hear.

1894
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:39,515
Have fun. Have fun, kids.
You got great teachers.

1895
01:29:39,598 --> 01:29:41,142
Yeah, come on, lemme give you
a ride in your cart.

1896
01:29:41,225 --> 01:29:42,726
She got the fire in her eye,
that one.

1897
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:45,104
Thank you. I miss this sucker.

1898
01:29:45,187 --> 01:29:47,148
Richard, there's, uh...

1899
01:29:47,231 --> 01:29:49,650
There's a tournament
in Oakland coming up.

1900
01:29:49,734 --> 01:29:51,152
It's called
the Bank of the West.

1901
01:29:51,235 --> 01:29:53,737
Now, I called the director.

1902
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:55,156
He said they'd, uh,

1903
01:29:55,239 --> 01:29:57,199
give Venus a wild card
if we committed now.

1904
01:29:57,283 --> 01:29:59,034
Also, my friend Patrick,
he's from Nike,

1905
01:29:59,118 --> 01:30:01,078
he's gonna be there, and
he's available for a sit-down.

1906
01:30:01,162 --> 01:30:02,580
I don't like that.
I don't like that, Rick.

1907
01:30:02,663 --> 01:30:04,123
You don't like what, Richard?
Wait a second.

1908
01:30:04,206 --> 01:30:05,541
Don't talk to peoples
behind my back like that.

1909
01:30:05,624 --> 01:30:07,001
I'm not talking
to anybody behind...

1910
01:30:07,084 --> 01:30:08,544
Don't do that.
You know I don't like that.

1911
01:30:08,627 --> 01:30:10,171
- Don't do that.
- Wait, wait, wait, Richard,

1912
01:30:10,254 --> 01:30:11,547
hang on a second. Will you
just hear me out, please?

1913
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:13,674
Look, she's...
she's 14 years old.

1914
01:30:13,757 --> 01:30:16,010
Hingis just turned pro.
Kournikova, she's going soon.

1915
01:30:16,093 --> 01:30:19,013
I don't understand why we
would give them a head start.

1916
01:30:19,096 --> 01:30:20,890
Jennifer,
she'd been on the cover

1917
01:30:20,973 --> 01:30:22,349
of a freaking
Wheaties box by now.

1918
01:30:22,433 --> 01:30:23,934
And I know
I'm not supposed to say this,

1919
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:26,479
but Venus is twice as good
as Jennifer ever was.

1920
01:30:26,562 --> 01:30:28,189
Jennifer just dropped
off the tour.

1921
01:30:28,272 --> 01:30:29,815
Nah, she...

1922
01:30:29,899 --> 01:30:32,359
She didn't drop off the tour.
She's taking a break, okay?

1923
01:30:32,443 --> 01:30:33,944
- Rick, tell me the truth.
- It's a vacation.

1924
01:30:34,028 --> 01:30:35,446
- I am telling you the truth.
- Peoples are saying

1925
01:30:35,529 --> 01:30:36,989
- that she burnt out.
- She's not burnt out.

1926
01:30:37,072 --> 01:30:38,699
Richard, Jennifer is fine,
but you know what?

1927
01:30:38,782 --> 01:30:40,117
So is Venus.

1928
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:42,536
Come on, man.
Look, she's ready.

1929
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:43,871
Hold your racket
like this.

1930
01:30:43,954 --> 01:30:45,331
Let's get this show
on the road.

1931
01:30:45,414 --> 01:30:46,582
I can see it in her eyes.

1932
01:30:46,665 --> 01:30:48,834
She's hungry.
She's got the fire.

1933
01:30:48,918 --> 01:30:51,295
Come on, Richard.
What do you say?

1934
01:30:51,378 --> 01:30:52,796
Did she send you up here
to talk to me?

1935
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,715
- You're gonna beat me?
- I'm gonna hit it now.

1936
01:30:54,798 --> 01:30:57,259
Look,
it's not just my idea.

1937
01:30:58,677 --> 01:31:01,305
Rick, I don't say this
to you too often...

1938
01:31:01,388 --> 01:31:04,475
- Okay.
- ...but you are not wrong.

1939
01:31:05,184 --> 01:31:06,477
So, does that...

1940
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:07,561
But that's all you're getting
from me today.

1941
01:31:07,645 --> 01:31:08,687
- Okay?
- Okay.

1942
01:31:08,771 --> 01:31:10,231
Just let me think about it.

1943
01:31:10,314 --> 01:31:11,732
- I'll take it.
- All right.

1944
01:31:11,815 --> 01:31:13,067
Thank you for your time,
Richard.

1945
01:31:13,150 --> 01:31:14,568
Mm.

1946
01:31:14,652 --> 01:31:16,820
Uh, you can borrow
your cart if you want.

1947
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:18,781
No, that's okay, Richard,
you hang onto it.

1948
01:31:18,864 --> 01:31:20,074
It looks great on you.

1949
01:31:20,157 --> 01:31:21,575
No, just have it back
in 40 minutes.

1950
01:31:21,659 --> 01:31:23,244
Okay.

1951
01:31:23,327 --> 01:31:25,454
Oh, my gosh.

1952
01:31:25,538 --> 01:31:27,331
<i>...far more than expected.</i>

1953
01:31:27,414 --> 01:31:29,416
<i>It doesn't look like
the tide will turn back</i>

1954
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,961
<i>in the favor of drivers
in the near future...</i>

1955
01:31:32,044 --> 01:31:33,462
- Thank you.
- Here you go, sir.

1956
01:31:33,546 --> 01:31:35,256
My wife think I got
a girlfriend down here,

1957
01:31:35,339 --> 01:31:37,424
I be coming to get
your burgers so much.

1958
01:31:37,508 --> 01:31:39,760
She don't know
I'm cheating on her cooking.

1959
01:31:39,843 --> 01:31:42,471
<i>Michael Williams
has that story from Miami.</i>

1960
01:31:42,555 --> 01:31:44,431
<i>Jennifer Capriati now faces</i>

1961
01:31:44,515 --> 01:31:46,267
<i>her most serious court battle.</i>

1962
01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:47,768
<i>The 18-year-old was arrested</i>

1963
01:31:47,851 --> 01:31:50,771
<i>after police showed up

1964
01:31:50,854 --> 01:31:52,606
<i>to check a tip

1965

<i>They say that they found

1966

01:32:03,033 --> 01:32:06,412
<i>and suspected

1970
01:32:06,495 --> 01:32:08,789
Let's go!

1971
01:32:08,872 --> 01:32:10,040
What do you say?
What do you say?

1972
01:32:10,124 --> 01:32:11,959
Time to get sharp for the Bay.

1973
01:32:12,042 --> 01:32:14,169
Little steps, big results.

1974
01:32:14,253 --> 01:32:18,382
What's going on?
Where is everybody?

1975
01:32:18,465 --> 01:32:20,467
Come on, guys, somebody say
something. What's going on?

1976
01:32:20,551 --> 01:32:22,469
- They're at Disney World.
- They're what?

1977
01:32:22,553 --> 01:32:23,887
They're at Disney World.

1978
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:26,056
Richard said practice
is cancelled for today.

1979
01:32:27,725 --> 01:32:29,310
Ah, you gotta be...

1980
01:32:36,609 --> 01:32:38,068
There go Rick.
There go Rick.

1981
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:40,029
- Hey, Richard.
- Hey, Rick.

1982
01:32:47,244 --> 01:32:48,454
- Okay, let's go.
- Come on.

1983
01:32:48,537 --> 01:32:50,164
Homework, homework.
You got homework.

1984
01:32:50,247 --> 01:32:51,915
- Hello, everybody.
- Hey!

1985
01:32:51,999 --> 01:32:54,335
- You guys have a good time?
- I rode on Space Mountain.

1986
01:32:54,418 --> 01:32:56,211
- Did ya? Were you scared?
- I was not scared.

1987
01:32:56,295 --> 01:32:57,880
They were crying like babies.

1988
01:32:57,963 --> 01:32:59,548
- I like those ears.
- Don't drop that.

1989
01:32:59,632 --> 01:33:02,176
Richard, Richard, maybe
if I could just get a minute?

1990
01:33:02,259 --> 01:33:03,385
Thank you.

1991
01:33:04,970 --> 01:33:06,430
There was, uh...

1992
01:33:06,513 --> 01:33:08,807
- We had a practice scheduled.
- Uh-huh.

1993
01:33:08,891 --> 01:33:11,101
Tournament's just
a few weeks away, so,

1994
01:33:11,185 --> 01:33:12,603
you know, we gotta practice.

1995
01:33:12,686 --> 01:33:16,065
Yeah, well, I decided we not
playing that tournament.

1996
01:33:16,148 --> 01:33:18,525
Daddy, what?
Why? What happened?

1997
01:33:18,609 --> 01:33:20,110
It's okay, Junior.

1998
01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:22,363
I'm not gonna let him burn
you out like he did Capriati.

1999
01:33:22,446 --> 01:33:24,031
- What?
- I'm... I'm sorry,

2000
01:33:24,114 --> 01:33:25,532
like I did with what?

2001
01:33:25,616 --> 01:33:27,034
Well,
you was her coach, right?

2002
01:33:27,117 --> 01:33:28,410
- Mommy...
- It's all right.

2003
01:33:28,494 --> 01:33:29,828
That's all
you been saying is,

2004
01:33:29,912 --> 01:33:31,455
"Look at Jennifer.
Look at Jennifer."

2005
01:33:31,538 --> 01:33:33,791
Well, we looking. She on TV,
her mugshot. Arrested.

2006
01:33:33,874 --> 01:33:36,251
Venus is not gonna
be cracked out

2007
01:33:36,335 --> 01:33:38,045
in some alley
'cause you pushed her there.

2008
01:33:38,128 --> 01:33:39,797
- Come on.
- It's not fair.

2009
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,382
Venus,
don't you get upset.

2010
01:33:41,465 --> 01:33:43,884
Don't you let him
see you upset. Come on.

2011
01:33:43,967 --> 01:33:46,845
You proud of yourself?
Just broke her heart.

2012
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:52,142
I tell you what, man...

2013
01:33:52,226 --> 01:33:55,020
I'm getting pretty tired
of your games.

2014
01:33:56,605 --> 01:33:57,815
My games? What games?

2015
01:33:57,898 --> 01:33:59,108
These games.

2016
01:33:59,191 --> 01:34:00,943
You showed up here,
first thing you did,

2017
01:34:01,026 --> 01:34:02,444
you pulled 'em out of Juniors.

2018
01:34:02,528 --> 01:34:03,821
Now you pull 'em
out of practice.

2019
01:34:03,904 --> 01:34:05,280
You do it constantly.

2020
01:34:05,364 --> 01:34:07,574
For... For music lessons,
or homework, or church.

2021
01:34:07,658 --> 01:34:10,077
Look, they got to get
straight A's,

2022
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:11,787
else they can't play tennis.
You knew that.

2023
01:34:11,870 --> 01:34:13,038
I told you that.
That's my rules.

2024
01:34:13,122 --> 01:34:14,331
Well, you pull 'em
out to train

2025
01:34:14,415 --> 01:34:15,791
with other coaches
behind my back?

2026
01:34:17,459 --> 01:34:18,877
I'm trying to round out
they games.

2027
01:34:20,254 --> 01:34:21,880
They not gonna get great
doing the same drills...

2028
01:34:21,964 --> 01:34:23,132
- Thank you.
- ...that every other Junior

2029
01:34:23,215 --> 01:34:24,758
in America is doing.

2030
01:34:24,842 --> 01:34:26,218
I'm trying to look out
for my kids.

2031
01:34:26,301 --> 01:34:27,720
No, you're looking out
for yourself.

2032
01:34:27,803 --> 01:34:29,430
You know, all I hear from you
is pressure.

2033
01:34:29,513 --> 01:34:31,223
Pressure, pressure, pressure.

2034
01:34:31,306 --> 01:34:33,934
But you know what I see?
On TV, I see it every day.

2035
01:34:34,017 --> 01:34:35,769
I see
the Richard Williams Show.

2036
01:34:35,853 --> 01:34:38,856
A million dollars. Number one.
The greatest of all time.

2037
01:34:38,939 --> 01:34:40,733
You don't think
that adds pressure?

2038
01:34:40,816 --> 01:34:42,025
It add confidence.

2039
01:34:42,109 --> 01:34:44,111
Nah, that's bullshit.
It's about you.

2040
01:34:44,194 --> 01:34:46,447
Now, look, you wanna jerk
my chain, go on and jerk it.

2041
01:34:46,530 --> 01:34:49,408
But do not do it
to those girls.

2042
01:34:49,491 --> 01:34:52,995
Rick, all respects due,
we love you.

2043
01:34:53,078 --> 01:34:55,998
You... You like a member
of our family.

2044
01:34:56,081 --> 01:34:58,333
But you work for us.

2045
01:34:58,417 --> 01:35:00,127
- I wrote this plan.
- Plan.

2046
01:35:00,210 --> 01:35:02,129
And when I say
she's not playing,

2047
01:35:02,212 --> 01:35:04,089
she is not playing.

2048
01:35:04,173 --> 01:35:05,966
I call the shots.

2049
01:35:06,049 --> 01:35:08,844
And I'm sorry
if you don't like that.

2050
01:35:08,927 --> 01:35:11,513
Richard,
screw your freaking plan.

2051
01:35:11,597 --> 01:35:12,890
You don't know
what you're doing.

2052
01:35:14,224 --> 01:35:15,476
You don't.

2053
01:35:22,399 --> 01:35:25,152
That is a nice house,
by the way.

2054
01:35:25,235 --> 01:35:26,820
Remind me, who pays for that?

2055
01:35:26,904 --> 01:35:31,033
Don't do that. Don't do that.
You're a better man than that.

2056
01:35:53,806 --> 01:35:55,599
Are you going
after her?

2057
01:35:57,017 --> 01:35:59,394
- Uh, she'll be fine.
- No, she won't.

2058
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:01,772
Go fix this.

2059
01:36:03,690 --> 01:36:07,069
I puts
this whole thing together,

2060
01:36:07,152 --> 01:36:09,696
and now everybody seem to know
better than me.

2061
01:36:21,708 --> 01:36:23,043
Richard,

2062
01:36:23,127 --> 01:36:25,462
do you think
you did this by yourself?

2063
01:36:25,546 --> 01:36:28,048
From the first day we met.

2064
01:36:28,131 --> 01:36:30,384
Remember that?
Out on that bus stop?

2065
01:36:32,010 --> 01:36:35,013
You didn't even tell me
your real name.

2066
01:36:35,097 --> 01:36:38,433
'Cause you thought I was just
another dumb nigga.

2067
01:36:39,810 --> 01:36:41,562
You just like them White boys.

2068
01:36:41,645 --> 01:36:43,272
You never believed
in none of this.

2069
01:36:43,355 --> 01:36:45,190
When did I not believe?

2070
01:36:45,274 --> 01:36:47,734
I want you to tell me,
when did I not believe?

2071
01:36:47,818 --> 01:36:49,862
You not the only dreamer
in this family.

2072
01:36:49,945 --> 01:36:51,530
Wouldn't be no dream
if it wasn't for me.

2073
01:36:51,613 --> 01:36:54,616
I carried them
inside me and on my back.

2074
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:56,577
And I carried you, too.

2075
01:36:56,660 --> 01:37:01,164
Working two shifts so I could
put food on your table.

2076
01:37:01,248 --> 01:37:04,585
That open stance,
you got that from me.

2077
01:37:04,668 --> 01:37:07,462
Oh, you did that? Oh, okay.

2078
01:37:07,546 --> 01:37:10,924
And I fixed Serena's serve
because you messed that up.

2079
01:37:11,008 --> 01:37:12,301
You did what?

2080
01:37:12,384 --> 01:37:14,177
Yes, I fixed that toss
because you messed it up.

2081
01:37:14,261 --> 01:37:15,888
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm here. I've been here

2082
01:37:15,971 --> 01:37:18,473
dreaming and believing
just like you.

2083
01:37:18,557 --> 01:37:20,517
- Mm-hmm.
- You just don't wanna see me.

2084
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:25,606
So, uh, what you want?

2085
01:37:25,689 --> 01:37:28,108
What you want?
You want a thank you?

2086
01:37:29,526 --> 01:37:31,320
That's all right, Richard.
That's all right.

2087
01:37:31,403 --> 01:37:32,738
I don't need your thank you.

2088
01:37:32,821 --> 01:37:34,114
Unlike you,

2089
01:37:34,197 --> 01:37:36,783
I don't need the world
to tell me I'm great.

2090
01:37:42,289 --> 01:37:43,790
See how you do?

2091
01:37:43,874 --> 01:37:45,834
- You see what you just did?
- Come on.

2092
01:37:45,918 --> 01:37:47,711
How you walk away
when something's not finished.

2093
01:37:47,794 --> 01:37:49,630
- Did you just see that?
- Come on. Come on.

2094
01:37:49,713 --> 01:37:51,214
You see that?
That's what you do...

2095
01:37:51,298 --> 01:37:52,841
That's what you do with...
with all your businesses.

2096
01:37:52,925 --> 01:37:55,594
Remember the cement
company business...

2097
01:37:55,677 --> 01:37:56,762
Mm-hmm.

2098
01:37:56,845 --> 01:37:58,597
...the cleaning company
business.

2099
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:00,557
All your other kids.

2100
01:38:01,725 --> 01:38:03,602
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2101
01:38:03,685 --> 01:38:04,770
You sound like
you got something

2102
01:38:04,853 --> 01:38:06,730
you need
to get off your chest.

2103
01:38:06,813 --> 01:38:08,815
Don't let God stop you.
Say what you need to say.

2104
01:38:08,899 --> 01:38:10,525
Oh, I said it.

2105
01:38:10,609 --> 01:38:14,029
Your son showing up
in that red Nissan truck,

2106
01:38:14,112 --> 01:38:15,364
knocking on my door,

2107
01:38:15,447 --> 01:38:16,949
and all you had to say was,

2108
01:38:17,032 --> 01:38:20,410
"Oh, look, it's my son.
He found me."

2109
01:38:20,494 --> 01:38:23,330
And then all your other kids
showing up after that.

2110
01:38:23,413 --> 01:38:24,665
Okay.

2111
01:38:24,748 --> 01:38:27,167
See, another woman
would have left.

2112
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:29,711
But I stay
because I don't quit. You...

2113
01:38:29,795 --> 01:38:32,172
You're the one who leaves.

2114
01:38:32,255 --> 01:38:34,174
Well, go ahead, then.
Go ahead. Don't...

2115
01:38:34,257 --> 01:38:36,510
I will stay right here
until the job is done.

2116
01:38:36,593 --> 01:38:38,136
Don't stay here
doing me no favors.

2117
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:40,514
Richard, you think I'm staying
here because of you?

2118
01:38:40,597 --> 01:38:42,349
I stay here
because of my girls.

2119
01:38:42,432 --> 01:38:44,017
I stay here because I answer

2120
01:38:44,101 --> 01:38:46,061
to something higher
than Richard Williams.

2121
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:47,312
And you better be glad

2122
01:38:47,396 --> 01:38:50,107
because if I was
staying here for you,

2123
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:53,235
I would have been gone
a long time ago.

2124
01:38:53,318 --> 01:38:55,237
- Look at this house.
- I'm looking.

2125
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:56,488
Look where you live.

2126
01:38:56,571 --> 01:38:57,948
I'm looking.
I'm looking. I'm looking.

2127
01:38:58,031 --> 01:38:58,949
Where would you live
if it wasn't for me?

2128
01:38:59,032 --> 01:39:00,534
Where would you be?

2129
01:39:00,617 --> 01:39:03,328
Stuck in some apartment
with three kids and no daddy.

2130
01:39:03,412 --> 01:39:05,664
That's where you would be.

2131
01:39:05,747 --> 01:39:09,334
Listen to you. That's your ego
and your bragging.

2132
01:39:10,627 --> 01:39:12,254
You just scared.

2133
01:39:13,630 --> 01:39:15,132
You just scared.

2134
01:39:15,966 --> 01:39:18,385
Scared you will fail.

2135
01:39:18,468 --> 01:39:22,431
Scared that the world
will look at you and see

2136
01:39:22,514 --> 01:39:27,060
another dumb nigga.

2137
01:39:27,144 --> 01:39:31,773
And you know what?
You think they might be right.

2138
01:39:35,068 --> 01:39:36,611
I have never,

2139
01:39:37,821 --> 01:39:40,323
never thought that about you.

2140
01:39:51,126 --> 01:39:53,128
You've done your job.

2141
01:39:53,211 --> 01:39:56,256
And whether you wanna see it
or not, I've done mine.

2142
01:39:56,339 --> 01:40:00,969
But this is Venus's life.
You gotta let her decide.

2143
01:40:01,053 --> 01:40:03,221
Because if you don't
trust her to do that,

2144
01:40:03,305 --> 01:40:05,599
she's gonna be
the one leaving you.

2145
01:41:20,090 --> 01:41:21,925
So you wanna play?

2146
01:41:23,468 --> 01:41:26,513
I don't know
why you won't let me.

2147
01:41:26,596 --> 01:41:28,723
Unless you think
I'm not ready.

2148
01:41:47,242 --> 01:41:50,829
When I was a little boy,
I grew up in Shreveport.

2149
01:41:52,414 --> 01:41:54,457
One day, my father
took me to town.

2150
01:41:54,541 --> 01:41:57,669
He give me this money to pay
this White man for something.

2151
01:41:58,461 --> 01:42:00,088
Back in them days,

2152
01:42:00,172 --> 01:42:03,800
Black folks weren't allowed
to touch White peoples.

2153
01:42:03,884 --> 01:42:06,303
So I went to give
the man this money,

2154
01:42:06,386 --> 01:42:08,722
and I accidently touched
his hand.

2155
01:42:09,806 --> 01:42:11,933
And he start beating on me.

2156
01:42:13,476 --> 01:42:15,187
He knocked me down,
his friends come over,

2157
01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:19,441
they all start stomping on me
and beating on me.

2158
01:42:19,524 --> 01:42:22,360
And I look up and I see
my father in the crowd,

2159
01:42:23,528 --> 01:42:25,238
and he took off running.

2160
01:42:27,324 --> 01:42:30,160
Left me there with these
grown men beating on me.

2161
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:35,207
Now, I haven't been
no great daddy...

2162
01:42:36,875 --> 01:42:40,545
but I've never done nothing
but try to protect you.

2163
01:42:43,757 --> 01:42:47,344
This next step
you about to take,

2164
01:42:49,387 --> 01:42:52,015
it would...
It would be hard for anybody.

2165
01:42:53,475 --> 01:42:55,310
But for you,

2166
01:42:55,393 --> 01:42:57,229
you not gonna
just be representing you,

2167
01:42:57,312 --> 01:42:58,605
you gonna be representing

2168
01:42:58,688 --> 01:43:02,692
every little Black girl
on Earth.

2169
01:43:04,694 --> 01:43:09,282
And you gonna be the one
gotta through that gate.

2170
01:43:09,366 --> 01:43:12,619
And I just never
wanted you to look up...

2171
01:43:14,871 --> 01:43:17,415
and see your daddy
running away.

2172
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:23,588
Daddy, you always said

2173
01:43:23,672 --> 01:43:26,049
I'd be number one
in the world, right?

2174
01:43:28,134 --> 01:43:30,887
Let's go out there
and show all of those people

2175
01:43:30,971 --> 01:43:33,515
that I can handle
what's coming.

2176
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:37,769
And I'm not gonna
let you down.

2177
01:43:38,937 --> 01:43:40,855
How could you, Junior?

2178
01:43:45,068 --> 01:43:46,152
Come here.

2179
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:02,043
<i>Welcome

2180
01:44:02,127 --> 01:44:03,670

<i>Arantxa Sanchez Vicario,</i>

01:44:12,554 --> 01:44:16,474
<i>all hoping to take home

2186

14-year-old Venus Williams,</i>

- <i>...cannot hide.</i>

2200
01:44:56,473 --> 01:45:00,435
We been working for this day

2201
01:45:00,518 --> 01:45:01,770
Uh, you be saying,

2202
01:45:01,853 --> 01:45:03,563
"We gonna get there,
we gonna get there."

2203
01:45:03,646 --> 01:45:08,276

<i>We belong
back in the ghetto."</i>

2208
01:45:16,242 --> 01:45:21,331
<i>A genius? A huckster?
Tomorrow, we will finally see.</i>

2209
01:45:21,414 --> 01:45:23,041
<i>Is his dream only hype</i>

2210
01:45:23,124 --> 01:45:25,210
<i>or is his daughter, in fact,</i>

2211
01:45:25,293 --> 01:45:28,380
<i>what the tennis world
has been waiting for?</i>

2212
01:45:30,298 --> 01:45:31,591
You did it, Richard.

2213
01:45:31,674 --> 01:45:33,468
Last year, there was
24 media credentials

2214
01:45:33,551 --> 01:45:34,844
for this tournament.

2215
01:45:34,928 --> 01:45:37,430
This year, you got 200, so...

2216
01:45:37,514 --> 01:45:39,099
- You know what? That's him.
- Okay. That's him.

2217
01:45:39,182 --> 01:45:40,767
- We should get Venus, right?
- Okay. I got...

2218
01:45:40,850 --> 01:45:42,727
Guys, it's go time.
Look alive.

2219
01:45:42,811 --> 01:45:44,354
Come on. The man is here.
The man is here.

2220
01:45:44,437 --> 01:45:46,189
The Nike man here.
Y'all, close that. Close that.

2221
01:45:46,272 --> 01:45:48,566
This is it. This is it.
You guys are gonna go there.

2222
01:45:48,650 --> 01:45:50,318
- Yep. Go get in your position.
- Okay. You ready?

2223
01:45:50,402 --> 01:45:51,569
Get in your positions.

2224
01:45:51,653 --> 01:45:53,113
Okay. You ready?

2225
01:45:53,196 --> 01:45:54,489
Hey, Patrick, how you doing?

2226
01:45:54,572 --> 01:45:55,949
Very well.
Good to see you, Rick.

2227
01:45:56,032 --> 01:45:57,450
How's Terri
and the kids? They good?

2228
01:45:57,534 --> 01:45:58,910
- They're good, thank you.
- Yeah? That little Billy

2229
01:45:58,993 --> 01:46:00,453
- still playing baseball?
- That's right.

2230
01:46:00,537 --> 01:46:01,871
- Yeah, he's swingin' away.
- I like that.

2231
01:46:01,955 --> 01:46:02,956
- Hello.
- Richard Williams.

2232
01:46:03,039 --> 01:46:04,290
- Welcome.
- Hi. Patrick.

2233
01:46:04,374 --> 01:46:05,667
- Nice to meet you.
- This is Oracene.

2234
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:07,001
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- That's my wife,

2235
01:46:07,085 --> 01:46:08,628
- that's Brandy.
- Nice to meet you.

2236
01:46:08,711 --> 01:46:10,130
- You know who that is.
- Honor to meet you. Honored.

2237
01:46:10,213 --> 01:46:11,631
That's who you brought
that briefcase for.

2238
01:46:11,714 --> 01:46:12,715
That's right. Yeah.

2239
01:46:13,842 --> 01:46:15,218
Well, you had a long trip...

2240
01:46:15,301 --> 01:46:16,761
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and a big day tomorrow,

2241
01:46:16,845 --> 01:46:18,138
so I am not gonna take up
too much of your time.

2242
01:46:18,221 --> 01:46:19,347
Mm-hmm.

2243
01:46:19,431 --> 01:46:21,641
Now, I hope it is clear

2244
01:46:21,725 --> 01:46:24,018
how highly
we regard your daughter.

2245
01:46:24,102 --> 01:46:27,230
We'd like to take her
off the table right now.

2246
01:46:27,313 --> 01:46:30,150
- That is $3 million.
- Whoo.

2247
01:46:30,233 --> 01:46:32,652
Signature shoe.
Signature line.

2248
01:46:32,735 --> 01:46:34,988
We wanna build our women's
brand around Venus.

2249
01:46:35,071 --> 01:46:37,824
Make her a marquee player.
How's that sound?

2250
01:46:37,907 --> 01:46:39,742
Well, I think, uh...

2251
01:46:41,411 --> 01:46:42,829
Well, actually,

2252
01:46:43,913 --> 01:46:45,248
you need to be pitching her.

2253
01:46:48,209 --> 01:46:50,420
Well, Venus,
what do you think?

2254
01:46:50,503 --> 01:46:52,755
I mean,
that is a generous deal.

2255
01:46:52,839 --> 01:46:54,215
It's a million more
than Capriati got

2256
01:46:54,299 --> 01:46:56,551
- before she went pro.
- It's great.

2257
01:46:56,634 --> 01:46:58,928
Plus, a real commitment
to invest

2258
01:46:59,012 --> 01:47:00,555
in the charity
and outreach programs

2259
01:47:00,638 --> 01:47:03,141
- you and your family support.
- That's great.

2260
01:47:03,224 --> 01:47:05,894
We think you're gonna have
a tremendous career

2261
01:47:05,977 --> 01:47:09,606
and we wanna help you
build it, starting today.

2262
01:47:18,907 --> 01:47:20,992
Uh...

2263
01:47:21,075 --> 01:47:23,077
- It's, uh...
- Yeah.

2264
01:47:25,914 --> 01:47:27,874
Um...

2265
01:47:30,877 --> 01:47:33,713
Yeah, maybe...
Maybe just have a minute.

2266
01:47:33,796 --> 01:47:35,006
You know,
just let the family...

2267
01:47:35,089 --> 01:47:36,424
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2268
01:47:36,508 --> 01:47:38,176
- No problem, just for...
- Of course, of course.

2269
01:47:38,259 --> 01:47:40,345
But, uh, just to be clear,
this deal is for tonight only.

2270
01:47:40,428 --> 01:47:42,138
It's off the table
as soon as you step

2271
01:47:42,222 --> 01:47:44,557
on that court tomorrow, okay?
Take your time. Talk about it.

2272
01:47:44,641 --> 01:47:45,767
Patrick,
listen, thank you.

2273
01:47:45,850 --> 01:47:47,101
Yeah, we'll just
take a second.

2274
01:47:47,185 --> 01:47:48,853
There is a heck
of a seafood buffet.

2275
01:47:48,937 --> 01:47:50,230
Okay.

2276
01:47:50,313 --> 01:47:51,564
Now, it's
on the mezzanine level, right?

2277
01:47:51,648 --> 01:47:52,815
You don't wanna hit
one or two.

2278
01:47:52,899 --> 01:47:54,567
A lot of people
get that wrong.

2279
01:47:54,651 --> 01:47:55,860
Just fix your face
till the man get out the door.

2280
01:47:55,944 --> 01:47:57,153
What does he mean by that?

2281
01:47:57,237 --> 01:47:58,488
Let the man
get out the door first.

2282
01:47:59,948 --> 01:48:01,407
No, I wanna know
what he means though.

2283
01:48:01,491 --> 01:48:02,575
We gonna talk about it
when the man leaves.

2284
01:48:02,659 --> 01:48:03,743
Just let him get out the door.

2285
01:48:03,826 --> 01:48:05,286
What is going on?

2286
01:48:05,370 --> 01:48:07,455
I... What did he mean by,

2287
01:48:07,539 --> 01:48:09,290
it's one night only?
Tonight only?

2288
01:48:09,374 --> 01:48:10,625
Don't you
worry about that.

2289
01:48:10,708 --> 01:48:12,418
- Don't worry.
- But I wanna understand.

2290
01:48:12,502 --> 01:48:13,920
He's just trying to scare us.
He's just trying to scare us.

2291
01:48:14,003 --> 01:48:15,088
That's right.
He's trying to scare us,

2292
01:48:15,171 --> 01:48:16,339
and guess what? I'm scared.

2293
01:48:16,422 --> 01:48:18,758
I'm freaking terrified.

2294
01:48:18,841 --> 01:48:22,262
Guys, what...
What is going on?

2295
01:48:22,345 --> 01:48:25,807
$3 million.
What's the problem here?

2296
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:27,642
- Rick, look...
- Let me see.

2297
01:48:27,725 --> 01:48:29,602
They haven't even seen
the girl play yet.

2298
01:48:29,686 --> 01:48:32,480
Yeah, no, that...
I mean, that's the point.

2299
01:48:32,564 --> 01:48:35,483
They don't have to.
Richard, you did it.

2300
01:48:35,567 --> 01:48:37,151
Hey, you did it, Richard.

2301
01:48:37,235 --> 01:48:38,444
Look, I thought you were nuts.

2302
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:40,113
All the talking
and the interviews

2303
01:48:40,196 --> 01:48:41,364
and the nonsense.

2304
01:48:41,447 --> 01:48:43,616
But look, you were right,
she's a star.

2305
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:44,867
Look at what it...

2306
01:48:44,951 --> 01:48:46,160
We won, this is it.

2307
01:48:46,244 --> 01:48:48,830
Why is everybody so glum?
Please, guys.

2308
01:48:48,913 --> 01:48:50,915
Oracene, please,
can you help me out here?

2309
01:48:50,999 --> 01:48:53,042
You need
to be talking to Venus.

2310
01:48:54,752 --> 01:48:56,838
V, what's going on?

2311
01:48:58,923 --> 01:49:00,008
I just wanna show them

2312
01:49:00,091 --> 01:49:01,676
- what I can do.
- Okay.

2313
01:49:01,759 --> 01:49:03,803
I understand
it's a good offer but...

2314
01:49:03,886 --> 01:49:04,887
This is
not a good offer.

2315
01:49:04,971 --> 01:49:06,973
This is an unbelievable offer.

2316
01:49:07,056 --> 01:49:09,642
Guys, this is money
that changes your lives.

2317
01:49:09,726 --> 01:49:12,478
That changes your
family's lives. What do we...

2318
01:49:12,562 --> 01:49:13,646
Rick,

2319
01:49:13,730 --> 01:49:15,148
you asking this girl

2320
01:49:15,231 --> 01:49:16,482
to take all the hard work
she done did for the last...

2321
01:49:16,566 --> 01:49:17,817
Richard, stop it. Stop it.

2322
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:19,485
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

2323
01:49:19,569 --> 01:49:21,696
All the hard work she done did
for the last 10 years

2324
01:49:21,779 --> 01:49:23,990
and accept the first offer
that come through the door.

2325
01:49:24,073 --> 01:49:25,491
You know
that's not right, Rick.

2326
01:49:25,575 --> 01:49:26,743
Richard,
the draw's not even out yet.

2327
01:49:26,826 --> 01:49:28,453
- Rick.
- We don't know...

2328
01:49:28,536 --> 01:49:31,122
The girl is asking
for a opportunity to compete.

2329
01:49:31,205 --> 01:49:32,915
We don't even know
who she's playing.

2330
01:49:32,999 --> 01:49:35,418
She don't care
nothing about that.

2331
01:49:35,501 --> 01:49:39,047
Venus Williams,
do you care who you play?

2332
01:49:39,130 --> 01:49:40,256
No, Daddy.

2333
01:49:40,340 --> 01:49:41,924
Venus Williams,
are you gonna beat

2334
01:49:42,008 --> 01:49:43,426
whoever on the other side
of that net?

2335
01:49:43,509 --> 01:49:45,178
Yes, Daddy.

2336
01:49:45,261 --> 01:49:48,306
Venus Williams,
do you wanna take this deal?

2337
01:49:52,977 --> 01:49:54,145
No.

2338
01:49:54,228 --> 01:49:55,730
Well, there it is.

2339
01:49:55,813 --> 01:49:57,649
We're not taking the deal.
Let's go get something to eat.

2340
01:49:59,275 --> 01:50:01,361
- Rick, you hungry?
- No.

2341
01:50:01,444 --> 01:50:02,945
Come on,
everybody, let's go.

2342
01:50:03,029 --> 01:50:04,530
It's a...

2343
01:50:04,614 --> 01:50:06,032
Come on, Rick,
you got to pay for this food.

2344
01:50:06,115 --> 01:50:07,575
Hey, y'all.

2345
01:50:07,659 --> 01:50:09,285
- Hey, everybody.
- Tunde!

2346
01:50:09,369 --> 01:50:10,703
There you go.

2347
01:50:10,787 --> 01:50:12,246
- Look at that. Look at that.
- Hey. Whoa.

2348
01:50:14,916 --> 01:50:16,542
- Hi! How are you?
- Yeah.

2349
01:50:16,626 --> 01:50:18,753
Mister Rick is paying for us
to go to the seafood buffet.

2350
01:50:18,836 --> 01:50:21,172
- Ooh.
- Yeah. Yes, come on.

2351
01:50:21,255 --> 01:50:22,757
Hi.

2352
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:24,634
You knew about this?

2353
01:50:29,597 --> 01:50:31,724
- Yes.
- Yeah! Come on!

She's looking
a little tight out there.

2369
01:51:54,056 --> 01:51:55,516
But she's gonna loosen up.

2370
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:57,059
It's gonna be good. I'm gonna
check out another match.

2371
01:51:57,143 --> 01:51:58,853
I'll talk to you later, okay?

2372

2376
01:52:20,750 --> 01:52:23,669
Hey, let it go now.
Next game. Let that go.

2377
01:53:08,297 --> 01:53:09,465
- Yeah!
- <i>Love-15.</i>

2378
01:53:09,549 --> 01:53:11,008
Attagirl, V.

2379
01:53:15,263 --> 01:53:16,389
There you go.

2380
01:53:19,433 --> 01:53:22,436
That's a great ball!
That's a great ball!

2381
01:53:25,356 --> 01:53:26,566
<i>Game, Williams.</i>

2382
01:53:26,649 --> 01:53:28,776
<i>Stafford leads
four games to two.</i>

2383
01:53:32,154 --> 01:53:33,656
- Let's go!
- <i>Game, Williams.</i>

2384
01:53:33,739 --> 01:53:35,825
- There it is. There you go.
- <i>Four games all.</i>

2385
01:53:58,973 --> 01:54:00,433
You were great
tonight, Venus.

2386
01:54:00,516 --> 01:54:02,602
Were you surprised
how you handled your nerves?

2387
01:54:02,685 --> 01:54:05,271
I was somewhat surprised
but somewhat not surprised.

2388
01:54:05,354 --> 01:54:07,273
I guess since I haven't played
a tournament in a while,

2389
01:54:07,356 --> 01:54:09,317
I was surprised that I wasn't
nervous or jumpy.

2390
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:11,152
Tomorrow, you play
the top seed, Vicario.

2391
01:54:11,235 --> 01:54:14,405
She's number one in the world,
a three-time Grand Slam champ.

2392
01:54:14,488 --> 01:54:16,282
How do you think
you'll hold up?

2393
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:19,952
I think I have the game
to beat anyone.

2394
01:54:20,036 --> 01:54:21,370
I just have to play it.

2395
01:54:21,454 --> 01:54:22,830
- Also, I was wondering...
- That's enough though.

2396
01:54:22,914 --> 01:54:24,040
Real good questions.

2397
01:54:24,123 --> 01:54:26,167
Let's go! Huh?

2398
01:54:26,250 --> 01:54:28,794
What did you do out there?
I... I couldn't believe it.

2399
01:54:28,878 --> 01:54:30,379
- It's like...
- Okay, Rick, I gotta go.

2400
01:54:30,463 --> 01:54:32,465
It's like she's a...
a hired assassin.

2401
01:54:32,548 --> 01:54:35,092
I mean,
it's, like, unbelievable.

2402
01:54:35,176 --> 01:54:37,011
Richard,
I talked to Dougherty.

2403
01:54:37,094 --> 01:54:38,387
He's upping the offer.

2404
01:54:38,471 --> 01:54:39,805
$4 million, Richard.

2405
01:54:39,889 --> 01:54:42,600
$4 million.
We did it. We did it, Richard.

2406
01:54:42,683 --> 01:54:44,060
I think we just gonna
keep our chips

2407
01:54:44,143 --> 01:54:45,144
on the table though, Rick.

2408
01:54:45,227 --> 01:54:46,395
Wait, wait. Hey, Richard, no.

2409
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:47,855
She's playing Vicario.

2410
01:54:47,939 --> 01:54:49,357
She's the best player
on the planet, Richard.

2411
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:50,483
She's the best player
in the whole wide world.

2412
01:54:50,566 --> 01:54:52,068
She... She can't beat her.

2413
01:54:52,151 --> 01:54:53,819
But what if she do?

2414
01:54:53,903 --> 01:54:55,321
Richard,
it doesn't work like that.

2415
01:54:55,404 --> 01:54:58,115
Oh, hey, Bud. Bud.
Good to see you.

2416
01:54:58,199 --> 01:54:59,784
Still got
them pretty pants on.

2417
01:54:59,867 --> 01:55:01,452
You missed out on this money
though. I tried to tell ya.

2418
01:55:01,535 --> 01:55:03,287
You know him?

2419
01:55:03,371 --> 01:55:05,665
Rick, if she beats Vicario,

2420
01:55:05,748 --> 01:55:08,459
a 14-year-old
who's never played a match,

2421
01:55:08,542 --> 01:55:12,380
walks off the street and beats
the best player on the planet,

2422
01:55:12,463 --> 01:55:13,881
forget Ali-Frazier,

2423
01:55:13,965 --> 01:55:16,926
it'll be the greatest upset
in the history of sports!

2424
01:55:35,403 --> 01:55:37,697
Yes!

2425
01:55:39,782 --> 01:55:41,075
Oh.

2426
01:55:52,586 --> 01:55:54,755
Meek, come on.

2427
01:56:09,311 --> 01:56:12,273
I know you love Venus,

2428
01:56:12,356 --> 01:56:15,234
and all this is exciting,

2429
01:56:15,317 --> 01:56:17,737
but it's a little hard
for you, too, huh?

2430
01:56:21,323 --> 01:56:23,034
Can I tell you a secret?

2431
01:56:24,785 --> 01:56:28,372
Your sister is gonna be
number one in the whole world,

2432
01:56:28,456 --> 01:56:30,249
no doubt about it.

2433
01:56:30,332 --> 01:56:31,584
I know that.

2434
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:34,420
But you,

2435
01:56:34,503 --> 01:56:37,048
you gonna be
the best there ever was.

2436
01:56:38,424 --> 01:56:42,636
You gonna be
the greatest of all time.

2437
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:46,140
You know how I know?
'Cause I planned for it.

2438
01:56:47,725 --> 01:56:51,103
I knew you was having
a hard time in Venus's shadow,

2439
01:56:51,187 --> 01:56:53,481
but I kept you there
'cause I knew you was rough.

2440
01:56:53,564 --> 01:56:56,609
I knew you was tough,
I knew you was a fighter.

2441
01:56:58,235 --> 01:57:01,072
That's why I did
this whole thing like this.

2442
01:57:05,201 --> 01:57:06,869
Go on, take that in.

2443
01:57:08,287 --> 01:57:09,747
You're up next.

2444
01:57:19,548 --> 01:57:22,426
Come on now. Move your feets.

2445
01:57:22,510 --> 01:57:24,720
One, two, three, four, five.

2446
01:57:24,804 --> 01:57:26,347
One, two, three, four, five.

2447
01:57:26,430 --> 01:57:28,974
One, two, three, four, five.

2448
01:57:29,058 --> 01:57:30,893
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

2449
01:57:30,976 --> 01:57:32,812
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

2450
01:57:32,895 --> 01:57:34,313
Now, whatever
happens tonight...

2451
01:57:34,396 --> 01:57:36,190
- Close, close.
- Next time, 10.

2452
01:57:36,273 --> 01:57:38,734
...I want you guys to remember

2453
01:57:38,818 --> 01:57:41,779
that you come
from a rich history of people.

2454
01:57:42,488 --> 01:57:43,614
Right?

2455
01:57:43,697 --> 01:57:46,158
Like Sojourner Truth.

2456
01:57:46,242 --> 01:57:48,202
- Remember her?
- Yes.

2457
01:57:48,285 --> 01:57:50,663
What did she say
at Seneca Falls?

2458
01:57:50,746 --> 01:57:52,957
What she say? What she say?

2459
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:55,042
- "Ain't I a woman?"
- That's right, that's right.

2460
01:57:55,126 --> 01:57:56,335
And what does
that mean to you?

2461
01:57:56,418 --> 01:57:58,254
- What does that mean to you?
- Um...

2462
01:57:58,337 --> 01:58:01,048
That she's strong
and that she can do anything.

2463
01:58:01,132 --> 01:58:02,341
Exactly.

2464
01:58:02,424 --> 01:58:05,261
That she was
a young Black woman,

2465
01:58:05,344 --> 01:58:07,096
just like you guys,

2466
01:58:07,179 --> 01:58:09,473
and that she deserves
to be seen,

2467
01:58:09,557 --> 01:58:12,852
and that she deserves
to be heard.

2468
01:58:12,935 --> 01:58:15,521
So, tonight, I want you
to remember who you are,

2469
01:58:15,604 --> 01:58:18,357
remember where you came from.

2470
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:20,734
Stand tall
and be proud in that.

2471
01:58:22,278 --> 01:58:23,487
All right?

2472
01:58:25,281 --> 01:58:27,950
Yeah.
You gonna look beautiful.

2473
01:58:30,411 --> 01:58:32,329
You are beautiful, Venus.

2474
01:58:37,042 --> 01:58:39,795
You too, Serena.

2475
01:58:42,715 --> 01:58:44,300
<i>Hello, everybody,</i>

2476
01:58:44,383 --> 01:58:45,885

2483
01:59:00,399 --> 01:59:02,818
before a sold-out crowd
tonight.

2484
01:59:08,324 --> 01:59:09,575
Waiting for my daughter

That's how she do that.

2509
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:08,921
- Impressive.
- Yep. Yep.

2510
02:02:17,179 --> 02:02:18,722

- Ooh!
- <i>First set.</i>

2516
02:02:42,454 --> 02:02:44,748
See that?
Flames come off that ball.

2517
02:02:49,169 --> 02:02:50,712
- <i>40-15.</i>
- That's it. That's it.

2518
02:02:50,796 --> 02:02:52,131
You like that?

2519
02:02:52,214 --> 02:02:54,967
My wife taught her that.

2520
02:02:55,050 --> 02:02:58,220
That's Venus Williams.
Remember that name.

2521
02:03:02,099 --> 02:03:04,685
Okay, that's a can of corn.
That's a can of corn!

2522
02:03:06,979 --> 02:03:08,272
<i>Game, Williams.</i>

2523
02:03:08,355 --> 02:03:10,774
<i>Williams leads
five games to two.</i>

2524
02:03:10,858 --> 02:03:11,900
<i>First set.</i>

2525
02:03:11,984 --> 02:03:13,986
See how she do
that open stance?

2526
02:03:14,069 --> 02:03:16,113
- That's what we worked on.
- Yeah.

2527
02:03:19,867 --> 02:03:21,368
That's right.

2528
02:03:21,452 --> 02:03:23,412
Looking good, Venus Williams.

2529
02:03:27,708 --> 02:03:29,001
- Whoa.
- There you go.

2530
02:03:29,084 --> 02:03:31,044
<i>Game. First set.
Venus Williams.</i>

2531
02:03:31,128 --> 02:03:33,505
- Come on, Venus!
- That's it, kid! That's it!

2532
02:03:38,135 --> 02:03:39,344
There you go.

2533
02:03:39,428 --> 02:03:41,472
That's all that hard work,
right there.

2534
02:04:00,782 --> 02:04:02,159
<i>Game, Williams.</i>

2535
02:04:02,242 --> 02:04:03,911
<i>She leads the set 3-1.</i>

2536
02:04:03,994 --> 02:04:07,331
She's scared of you.
She's scared of you, Venus.

2537
02:04:17,466 --> 02:04:19,384
<i>¡Esto es una locura!</i>

2538
02:04:52,459 --> 02:04:54,127
Just stay loose, Junior.

2539
02:05:08,225 --> 02:05:09,726
She's gone to the toilet.

2540
02:05:11,144 --> 02:05:12,229
Okay.

2541
02:05:32,499 --> 02:05:34,543
We're right here
with you, Venus.

2542
02:05:37,504 --> 02:05:39,047
- Stay in your game.
- Let it go.

2543
02:05:39,131 --> 02:05:40,465
- Stay in your game.
- You stay right there.

2544
02:05:40,549 --> 02:05:41,466
- Stay in your game.
- You got it, V.

2545
02:05:41,550 --> 02:05:42,801
We love you.

2546
02:05:50,684 --> 02:05:52,894
Don't let it
get in your head, Junior.

2547
02:06:02,112 --> 02:06:03,113
Oh, come on.

2548
02:06:03,196 --> 02:06:04,781
What's... What's happening?

2549
02:06:06,158 --> 02:06:07,618
She's icing her.

2550
02:06:07,701 --> 02:06:09,870
- They don't have a rule...
- There's nothing we can do.

2551
02:06:09,953 --> 02:06:11,163
...for how long
you can stay in the...

2552
02:06:11,246 --> 02:06:12,623
They can't... There's...

2553
02:06:12,706 --> 02:06:15,000
She can just say she's
in there using the toilet.

2554
02:06:15,083 --> 02:06:16,543
It's a dirty, old trick.

2555
02:06:19,463 --> 02:06:21,506
That's eight minutes already.

2556
02:06:22,633 --> 02:06:24,468
That's eight minutes.

2557
02:06:27,095 --> 02:06:28,805
That's nine minutes.

2558
02:06:35,312 --> 02:06:37,314
You got her
on the ropes!

2559
02:06:39,941 --> 02:06:40,901
Let's go!

2560
02:06:40,984 --> 02:06:42,903
This is ridiculous!

2561
02:06:57,209 --> 02:06:58,835
Why won't she stand up?

2562
02:06:59,795 --> 02:07:01,171
Stand up, Junior.

2563
02:07:25,904 --> 02:07:28,073
That's all right,
just stay in it, V.

2564
02:07:28,156 --> 02:07:30,200
- Let's go, Venus.
- Hey, V, your game.

2565
02:07:30,283 --> 02:07:32,744
Your game, Venus. Let's go.

2566
02:07:32,828 --> 02:07:34,955
- <i>Time.</i>
- That's right. Let's go.

2567
02:07:37,833 --> 02:07:40,210
Yeah! Feel your game!

2568
02:08:01,690 --> 02:08:05,485
- Out.
- <i>Love-15.</i>

2569
02:08:05,569 --> 02:08:07,946
- You got the next one, Venus.
- Hey, fight it.

2570
02:08:08,029 --> 02:08:09,948
You got the next one, Venus.

2571
02:08:16,204 --> 02:08:18,415
- Let!
- <i>Fault.</i>

2572
02:08:19,791 --> 02:08:21,543
Let it go. Let's go.
Next one.

2573
02:08:34,890 --> 02:08:35,932
Yes!

2574
02:08:39,394 --> 02:08:40,937
Come on, Venus Williams.

2575
02:08:56,244 --> 02:08:57,871
<i>¡Esta si!</i>

2576
02:08:57,954 --> 02:09:00,832
<i>Game, Vicario.
Three games all.</i>

2577
02:09:06,963 --> 02:09:08,256
<i>15-40.</i>

2578
02:09:14,387 --> 02:09:15,931
Okay, Junior.

2579
02:09:21,686 --> 02:09:23,396
<i>Game, Vicario.</i>

2580
02:09:26,775 --> 02:09:28,944
<i>Game, Vicario.</i>

2581
02:09:33,323 --> 02:09:35,575
<i>Game. Second set,</i>

2582
02:09:35,659 --> 02:09:38,537
<i>Vicario, six-three.
One set all.</i>

2583
02:09:50,090 --> 02:09:51,550
Oh, my God.

2584
02:10:44,269 --> 02:10:46,813
<i>Five-love. Final set.</i>

2585
02:11:01,369 --> 02:11:02,787
<i>Love-40.</i>

2586
02:11:06,583 --> 02:11:08,335
It's all right, Venus.

2587
02:11:28,813 --> 02:11:31,650
<i>Game, set, and match.
Vicario, two sets to one.</i>

2588
02:11:31,733 --> 02:11:34,736
<i>Two-six, six-three, six-love.</i>

2589
02:11:45,413 --> 02:11:46,831
Good job, Venus.

2590
02:11:49,751 --> 02:11:53,922
She did good out there.
She did great. She did great.

2591
02:12:15,777 --> 02:12:17,487
Hey, V.

2592
02:12:19,990 --> 02:12:21,074
Okay.

2593
02:12:32,794 --> 02:12:34,796
I should have won tonight.

2594
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:41,553
Now all our deals,
no respects...

2595
02:12:41,636 --> 02:12:43,680
Uh-uh. No. No, no, no.

2596
02:12:43,763 --> 02:12:45,015
- Don't do that.
- Mm-mm.

2597
02:12:45,098 --> 02:12:46,641
You were counting on me.

2598
02:12:46,725 --> 02:12:49,102
Okay, okay,
you listen to me.

2599
02:12:50,020 --> 02:12:51,146
Look here.

2600
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:54,691
You just went toe-to-toe

2601
02:12:54,774 --> 02:12:56,651
for two hours

2602
02:12:56,735 --> 02:12:59,821
with the number-one player
in the whole world.

2603
02:12:59,904 --> 02:13:01,281
Had her shook.

2604
02:13:01,364 --> 02:13:03,366
- Had her knees shaking.
- Yes.

2605
02:13:04,159 --> 02:13:05,326
Yes.

2606
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:07,328
And you did it with grace.

2607
02:13:09,205 --> 02:13:12,250
If you don't have no respect
for yourself right now,

2608
02:13:12,333 --> 02:13:14,335
you will never have none.

2609
02:13:15,003 --> 02:13:16,296
At all.

2610
02:13:17,630 --> 02:13:21,176
You are a champion,
Venus Williams.

2611
02:13:21,259 --> 02:13:23,303
And the whole world know it.

2612
02:13:24,763 --> 02:13:27,599
You gonna walk out there
with your head up.

2613
02:13:29,184 --> 02:13:32,562
I have never been more proud
of a person

2614
02:13:32,645 --> 02:13:34,314
in my whole life.

2615
02:13:40,070 --> 02:13:42,489
Come on, your sisters outside
waiting for you. It's cold.

2616
02:13:53,541 --> 02:13:55,293
Daddy, I'll take my bag.

2617
02:13:55,376 --> 02:13:57,670
- No, I'll carry it, Junior.
- I got it.

2618
02:14:10,308 --> 02:14:12,310
Hey, champion.

2619
02:14:12,393 --> 02:14:13,770
There she go.

2620
02:14:21,945 --> 02:14:23,613
We're proud of you.

2621
02:14:23,696 --> 02:14:25,865
You did it, V.

2622
02:14:50,682 --> 02:14:53,560
We're proud of you.
You did good.

2623
02:14:53,643 --> 02:14:57,355
You're the second of
all the players in the world.

2624
02:14:57,438 --> 02:14:59,149
This is the exit.
I can let you all out here.

2625
02:14:59,232 --> 02:15:01,192
Thank you, sir.
Y'all go ahead.

2626
02:15:12,203 --> 02:15:13,371
Richard.

2627
02:15:13,454 --> 02:15:15,415
Venus! Venus! Venus!

2628
02:15:15,498 --> 02:15:18,334
Venus! Venus! Venus! Venus!

2629
02:15:18,418 --> 02:15:21,963

2631
02:15:25,633 --> 02:15:27,760
They look like they know.

2632
02:15:27,844 --> 02:15:30,680
Go on. Don't keep 'em waiting.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

2633
02:15:30,763 --> 02:15:32,473
That's your fans. Go ahead.

2634
02:15:33,641 --> 02:15:35,393
- Come on, Serena, come.
- Okay!

2635
02:15:35,476 --> 02:15:36,436
You next!

2636
02:15:36,519 --> 02:15:38,438
Venus! Venus! Venus!

2637
02:15:38,521 --> 02:15:40,190
Richard. Richard.

2638
02:15:40,982 --> 02:15:42,108
How about that, huh?

2639
02:15:42,192 --> 02:15:43,985
Hey, Nike's back on the line.

2640
02:15:44,068 --> 02:15:46,321
I mean, they're... They're
coming out of the woodwork.

2641
02:15:46,404 --> 02:15:47,780
Puma. Fila. Reebok.

2642
02:15:47,864 --> 02:15:49,866
They all wanna meet.
They all wanna meet first.

2643
02:15:49,949 --> 02:15:51,659
I'mma tell 'em
they can kiss my backside.

2644
02:15:51,743 --> 02:15:53,745
No, I think
we'll talk to the peoples.

2645
02:15:53,828 --> 02:15:55,455
I think we gonna talk to them.

2646
02:15:55,538 --> 02:15:57,874
Hey, Richard, she did it.

2647
02:15:57,957 --> 02:15:59,584
Oh, yeah, she did it.

2648
02:16:02,795 --> 02:16:04,964
Venus! Venus! Venus!

2649
02:16:05,048 --> 02:16:10,094
Venus! Venus! Venus! Venus!
Venus! Venus! Venus! Venus!

2650
02:16:12,138 --> 02:16:17,769
Venus! Venus! Venus!
Venus! Venus! Venus!

2651
02:16:17,852 --> 02:16:21,856
Venus! Venus!
Venus! Venus! Venus!

2652
02:17:31,759 --> 02:17:34,470
<i>We had the kids' future
planned before they were born,</i>

2653
02:17:34,554 --> 02:17:37,140
<i>and the first day that I took
Venus and Serena</i>

2654
02:17:37,223 --> 02:17:40,101
<i>to the tennis court,
I knew I had champions.</i>

2655
02:17:40,184 --> 02:17:42,061
<i>Sometimes I feel like
it was just...</i>

2656
02:17:42,145 --> 02:17:44,188
<i>destiny, for the both of 'em.</i>

2657
02:17:44,272 --> 02:17:45,690
<i>If you were a tennis player,</i>

2658
02:17:45,773 --> 02:17:47,066
<i>who would you want to be like?</i>

2659
02:17:47,150 --> 02:17:50,361
<i>I'd like other people
to be like me.</i>

2660
02:17:50,445 --> 02:17:52,864
<i>If she plays the way
that she's capable of,</i>

2661
02:17:52,947 --> 02:17:54,032
<i>this kid's gonna be great.</i>

2662
02:17:56,117 --> 02:17:57,702
<i>Venus and Serena Williams</i>

2663
02:17:57,785 --> 02:17:59,454

<i>They're the first sisters</i>

2665
02:18:06,794 --> 02:18:08,546
<i>and the first
African Americans</i>

2666
02:18:08,629 --> 02:18:13,676
<i>ever to claim the top two
spots in the world rankings.</i>

2667
02:18:20,808 --> 02:18:22,435
<i>People are so captivated</i>

2668
02:18:22,518 --> 02:18:26,773
<i>by the story of sisters
having to play each other.</i>

2669
02:18:26,856 --> 02:18:28,941
<i>This is how we've always
dreamed it would be.</i>

2670
02:18:35,782 --> 02:18:37,325
<i>Young African-American kids,</i>

2671
02:18:37,408 --> 02:18:39,786

02:18:39,869 --> 02:18:41,788
<i>No matter which one win,
we still win.</i>

2673
02:18:41,871 --> 02:18:44,248
<i>Raise your hand,
Serena. Venus.</i>

2674
02:18:51,672 --> 02:18:53,216
<i>My dad,
he always thought</i>

2675
02:18:53,299 --> 02:18:54,884
<i>it was important for me
to give back to the community.</i>

2676

<i>Being number one
is great, but fighting for</i>

2677
