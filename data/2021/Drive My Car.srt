1
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,932
From time to time,

2
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:59,532
she starts sneaking into Yamaga's house.

3
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,432
Yamaga?

4
00:01:03,267 --> 00:01:08,766
The name of her first love.
He's a high school classmate.

5
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:12,766
He's not aware of her love for him.

6
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,399
She doesn't want him to
know, so that's OK with her.

7
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:21,166
But she wants to know more about him.

8
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,816
She wants to know everything about him,

9
00:01:25,383 --> 00:01:27,882
without letting him know about her.

10
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,816
So she sneaks in.

11
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,449
Right.

12
00:01:35,717 --> 00:01:41,382
When he's attending classes,
she feigns illness and leaves early.

13
00:01:42,217 --> 00:01:45,982
Yamaga's an only child,
and his dad's an office worker.

14
00:01:46,383 --> 00:01:48,816
His mom's a school teacher.

15
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,382
So the girl knows there's
nobody at home during the day.

16
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,049
How does she sneak in?
She's just an ordinary teenager.

17
00:02:02,683 --> 00:02:08,782
She takes a guess and searches
under a potted plant by the front door.

18
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:11,116
There's a key.

19
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:15,282
What a careless family.

20
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:20,482
She uses it to let herself into the house.

21
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:25,216
She goes upstairs and opens a door.

22
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:32,266
The number on the soccer uniform
on a hanger tells her it's his room.

23
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,999
The room is tidy for a 17-year-old boy,

24
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:42,866
and she senses that he has controlling
parents, his mom in particular.

25
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,166
She breathes in.

26
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,866
She listens carefully.

27
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,566
She hears silence.

28
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,466
An amplified silence, like the sound
through a hearing aid, fills the room.

29
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,432
She lies down on Yamaga's bed.

30
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:16,866
She holds back the urge to masturbate.

31
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:29,232
Why? The limits of a television drama?

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,500
No.

33
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:36,199
She has her own set of rules.

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,599
Things she'll allow or
won't allow herself to do.

35
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:49,749
She can sneak into his
house, but not masturbate there.

36
00:03:50,183 --> 00:03:51,183
Right.

37
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:19,516
Then she leaves an
unused tampon in his room.

38
00:04:19,617 --> 00:04:21,049
A tampon?

39
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:24,117
-That's what you said.
-That's so weird.

40
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:27,916
More so than usual.
Can this be adapted for TV?

41
00:04:28,383 --> 00:04:33,182
Don't worry. The producer said,
it's for an innovative late-night slot.

42
00:04:34,217 --> 00:04:35,482
If you say so.

43
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,016
So she takes out an unused
tampon from her school bag

44
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,716
and puts it in a drawer in his desk.

45
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,684
What if his overprotective mom finds it?

46
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,049
She feels a rush of
excitement at the thought.

47
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,399
She's kinky.

48
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,499
The tampon is a token,
indicating she was really there.

49
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:57,732
A token.

50
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,832
She continues sneaking in
from time to time after that.

51
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,666
She's aware of the risks.

52
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:09,299
She's the type, who is trusted
by her parents and teachers,

53
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:11,332
so a lot is at stake.

54
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,566
Nevertheless, she can't stop.

55
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:16,699
She can't stop.

56
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,432
She sniffs around in his room,
longing for his slightest scent.

57
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:26,099
She always takes a token
from his room when she leaves.

58
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,566
A pencil or something
that he won't notice is gone.

59
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,532
And in exchange, she
leaves a token of herself.

60
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:37,800
At her most daring moment,

61
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:43,466
she took off her underwear and
put it deep in his chest of drawers.

62
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:51,032
She feels that they are gradually
mingling by exchanging such tokens.

63
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:56,500
And that she is giving him the
strength to escape his mother's control.

64
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,199
That's it for today.

65
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,116
I see.

66
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,849
Want to know the rest?

67
00:06:05,183 --> 00:06:07,082
Yeah, I do.

68
00:06:08,683 --> 00:06:12,416
Shall I wait, or shall I write it? Which?

69
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:15,782
You can still wait.

70
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,916
Yeah. I want to know the rest, too.

71
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,460
You really don't know?

72
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,282
I never do, do I?

73
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:27,916
Well, I thought maybe this
time it was about your first love.

74
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,682
Of course it's not!

75
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,282
Thanks.

76
00:06:52,783 --> 00:06:54,749
-Hello.
-Hello.

77
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:02,384
When does the curtain go up?

78
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:05,016
6:30 p.m. Doors open at 6:00.

79
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:07,149
I'll be cutting it close.

80
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:10,901
Don't bother coming.
You shouldn't slip out of a meeting.

81
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,867
I'll bother. I want to see your play.

82
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,799
-Break a leg.
-Thanks.

83
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,032
Not worth a curse.

84
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,967
(YOU SAY WE HAVE TO COME BACK TOMORROW?)

85
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,299
Yes.

86
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:52,466
(THEN WE CAN BRING A GOOD BIT OF ROPE.)

87
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,199
Yes.

88
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,866
(DIDI?)

89
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,100
Yes.

90
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:04,199
(I CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS.)

91
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,266
That's what you think.

92
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:14,032
(IF WE PARTED?
THAT MIGHT BE BETTER FOR US.)

93
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,900
We'll hang ourselves tomorrow.

94
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:23,382
Unless Godot comes.

95
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:25,916
(AND IF HE COMES?)

96
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,616
We'll be saved.

97
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:43,749
(WELL? SHALL WE GO?)

98
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:45,527
Pull on your trousers.

99
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:46,617
(WHAT?)

100
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,230
Pull on your trousers.

101
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,127
Yes?

102
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:00,382
May I come in?

103
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,916
Come in.

104
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,417
What?

105
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,382
It was great.

106
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,216
Yeah? I'm glad.

107
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:18,784
May I introduce someone now?

108
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:20,160
Yeah, after I change...

109
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,549
Takatsuki.

110
00:09:23,883 --> 00:09:25,849
Hello, I'm Takatsuki.

111
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:28,560
Your wife kindly invited me.

112
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,910
Don't say "wife."

113
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,832
I see you a lot on TV.

114
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,166
Thank you.

115
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,866
He's in my new one, too. A good role.

116
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,333
He always has a good role.

117
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:41,032
Better than ever.
He's the heroine's love interest.

118
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,866
Yes.

119
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:46,766
When I mentioned your play
during the production meeting,

120
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,300
and he said he wanted to come.

121
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,632
I'd heard about your
methods and was interested.

122
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:56,832
They're so different. Multilingual.

123
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,532
I'm not sure if this is the right
sentiment, but it was moving.

124
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,532
Really? You're a strange young man.

125
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:08,999
Oto, please.

126
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,300
It's true.

127
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,310
Yes, thank you.

128
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,443
Don't thank me.

129
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:15,733
I need to change, so maybe later.

130
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,199
Excuse me.

131
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:20,532
Good work.

132
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,882
Sorry, did I wake you?

133
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,790
You must be tired.

134
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:39,982
My flight's Narita at 9:00, gotta run.

135
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,549
See you.

136
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:43,516
See you.

137
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:00,443
You didn't have to come.

138
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:02,166
Here. Uncle Vanya.

139
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:05,410
I recorded it.
About time you need it, right?

140
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,000
Thanks.

141
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:13,047
You'll miss your flight.

142
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,332
See you. Take care.

143
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:19,166
See you.

144
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:43,399
Here, have some tea.

145
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,632
I don't feel like drinking tea.

146
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,966
How about vodka, then?

147
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:54,599
Nobody knows how I feel.

148
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:58,549
I can't sleep at night
from frustration and anger.

149
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,482
I've wasted my time.

150
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,082
I could have attained so much from life,

151
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:08,149
but it's too late now at this age.

152
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,449
Uncle Vanya, that's so boring.

153
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:18,249
You speak as if your former
convictions were somehow to blame.

154
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,016
But your convictions were not at fault.

155
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,949
You were the one at fault.

156
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,799
-Hi there.
-Hi. Did you get there all right?

157
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:30,999
Yeah.

158
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:33,332
Jury duty starts tomorrow?

159
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,710
Yeah.

160
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,116
How's your hotel? Comfy?

161
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,249
They're all the same.

162
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,549
Try any Vladivostok specialties.

163
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,882
What's the specialty?

164
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,383
I don't know, so I'm asking you.

165
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:49,316
How lazy.

166
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,682
A week later.

167
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:31,649
For 25 years he's been
pretending to be someone he's not.

168
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:36,649
Look at that swagger, acting
like he's some kind of lord!

169
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:42,482
You envy him, don't you?

170
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,132
Yes, I do. I envy him a lot.

171
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,699
Such good luck with women!

172
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,466
Don Juan himself couldn't
have had more experience!

173
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:02,732
His first wife, who was my sister...

174
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,299
Hey.

175
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:26,387
What a relief.

176
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,132
I'm OK.

177
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:31,910
You're really all right?

178
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,366
I don't know yet.

179
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,632
They examined me.
Still waiting for the results.

180
00:19:39,467 --> 00:19:41,299
Glaucoma in your left eye.

181
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,266
Glaucoma?

182
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:48,500
Damage to the optic nerve
causing partial vision loss.

183
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:54,499
Loss of vision in one eye is hard to
detect because the other eye adapts.

184
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:58,549
Which means that it
doesn't impact daily activities,

185
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:02,316
and by the time one
notices it, it's often too late.

186
00:20:02,983 --> 00:20:06,116
You were lucky it was diagnosed early.

187
00:20:09,383 --> 00:20:10,982
Can I drive?

188
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:12,982
It's not impossible.

189
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,049
That means I can?

190
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,949
Yes, if your symptoms don't worsen.

191
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,716
How is it treated?

192
00:20:21,683 --> 00:20:25,843
The root cause of glaucoma is
still unknown, so it can't be cured.

193
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,716
The goal is to slow its progression.

194
00:20:30,217 --> 00:20:32,649
These eye drops lower eye pressure.

195
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:39,316
You might doubt the effect, but you'll
lose your vision if you stop using it.

196
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,682
Make sure you use them twice daily.

197
00:20:56,183 --> 00:20:59,500
"Died February 25, 2001."

198
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,332
You wanted to drive today, didn't you?

199
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:39,733
Why?

200
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:42,666
Well, you just got your car back.

201
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:47,799
I love you dearly, but...

202
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,380
What, all of a sudden?

203
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:53,166
There's one thing I can't stand.

204
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:55,832
What?

205
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,832
Your driving. Face forward.

206
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:06,132
Why didn't you change lanes just now?

207
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,366
Hey, that could be
considered verbal harassment.

208
00:22:19,283 --> 00:22:21,282
Honestly speaking

209
00:22:24,683 --> 00:22:26,882
did you want kids again?

210
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:35,016
I don't know.

211
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,382
Nobody can take her place, after all.

212
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:42,250
But we could have loved them as much.

213
00:22:42,517 --> 00:22:46,229
There's no use in me wanting
something that you don't want.

214
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,116
I'm sorry.

215
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:55,382
It's not your fault.
I made that choice with you.

216
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,682
So it's all right.

217
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,982
I really do love you so much.

218
00:23:10,717 --> 00:23:12,016
Thanks.

219
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,282
I'm so glad you're with me.

220
00:25:29,717 --> 00:25:35,249
One day, she remembers
her previous existence.

221
00:25:39,383 --> 00:25:42,049
You mean that girl who sneaks in?

222
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,599
She used to be a
lamprey in her previous life.

223
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:52,566
A lamprey?

224
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:57,132
She was a noble lamprey.

225
00:25:58,233 --> 00:26:00,799
She didn't leech off the fish

226
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,966
that passed overhead
like other lampreys did.

227
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:12,066
She fastened her suction cup-like
mouth to a rock on the riverbed

228
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:14,966
and did nothing but sway there.

229
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,432
Until she wasted away

230
00:26:29,533 --> 00:26:33,032
and really became like riverweed,

231
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,032
she clung to the rock.

232
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:42,632
She doesn't remember how she died.

233
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,866
Did she starve to death?

234
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,232
Was she eaten by other fish?

235
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,016
All she remembers is swaying
at the bottom of the river.

236
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:10,882
In Yamaga's room, she
suddenly understands.

237
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,150
What she's doing here is the same.

238
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:26,449
She can't tear herself away from his
room, just like how she clung to a rock.

239
00:27:38,383 --> 00:27:43,116
Come to think of it,
the silence in this room

240
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,016
is very similar to under water.

241
00:27:52,117 --> 00:27:54,149
Time stands still.

242
00:27:57,983 --> 00:28:02,382
Past and present fade away.

243
00:28:04,633 --> 00:28:06,632
And she

244
00:28:07,967 --> 00:28:10,799
becomes a lamprey again.

245
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:15,766
She

246
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,899
begins to masturbate on Yamaga's bed.

247
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,666
She strips off all her
clothes one layer at a time.

248
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:35,900
She'd forbidden herself from doing it,

249
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,499
but now she can't stop.

250
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,299
Tears fall,

251
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:45,866
wetting the pillow.

252
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:53,466
She thinks that those
tears are her token for today.

253
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,899
Just then, someone comes home.

254
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,516
A door opens downstairs.

255
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:21,216
She notices then that it's starting
to get dark outside the window.

256
00:29:22,183 --> 00:29:23,482
Is it Yamaga?

257
00:29:24,217 --> 00:29:25,816
Or his father?

258
00:29:26,717 --> 00:29:28,349
His mother?

259
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:33,116
She hears that person
coming up the stairs.

260
00:29:35,217 --> 00:29:36,516
It's over.

261
00:29:37,283 --> 00:29:41,116
But now, she can stop at last.

262
00:29:43,183 --> 00:29:45,949
At last, it'll all end.

263
00:29:46,983 --> 00:29:51,682
She can finally escape the
karmic fate from her prior life.

264
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:57,282
She'll become a new person.

265
00:30:00,483 --> 00:30:03,482
The door opens.

266
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,832
"Neither eel nor fish!? Lamprey."

267
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,099
Do you remember yesterday's story?

268
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:26,032
Sorry, I don't remember clearly.
I was pretty much asleep.

269
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
I see.

270
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:28,732
Sorry.

271
00:31:29,633 --> 00:31:32,716
That just means it wasn't
worth remembering.

272
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:35,749
I have to go.

273
00:31:36,517 --> 00:31:38,160
You have plans today?

274
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,616
I'm teaching a workshop.
Didn't I tell you?

275
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,082
No.

276
00:31:43,283 --> 00:31:44,582
Sorry.

277
00:31:45,217 --> 00:31:46,427
Are you driving?

278
00:31:46,517 --> 00:31:48,349
Yeah.

279
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,116
Sorry, I still had it.

280
00:31:58,883 --> 00:31:59,949
Thanks.

281
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:01,493
Can you handle it?

282
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,916
-I'll be fine. See you...
-Yusuke.

283
00:32:04,617 --> 00:32:07,150
When you return tonight, can we talik?

284
00:32:07,783 --> 00:32:10,882
Of course. Why do you ask?

285
00:32:12,283 --> 00:32:14,682
-Have a nice day.
-You too.

286
00:32:21,883 --> 00:32:25,116
Is she faithful to him?

287
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,882
Yes, unfortunately.

288
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:32,016
Why unfortunately?

289
00:32:32,883 --> 00:32:37,582
Because that woman's fidelity
is a lie through and through.

290
00:32:38,183 --> 00:32:42,632
There's an abundance of
rhetoric, but no logic in it.

291
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:49,466
My life is lost,

292
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:51,747
there's no turning back.

293
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:57,366
That thought haunts me like
an evil spirit day and night.

294
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:02,032
My past went by without event.
It's unimportant.

295
00:33:02,967 --> 00:33:04,332
But the present

296
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:06,999
is worse.

297
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:13,366
What should I do about
my life and my love?

298
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:15,432
What happened...

299
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,799
When you speak to me of love and romance,

300
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,932
I feel like I'm in a daze

301
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:28,199
and don't know what to say.

302
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:41,732
Oh... Lord, have mercy.

303
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:43,999
Sonya.

304
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:46,799
I'm miserable.

305
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:50,582
If you only knew how miserable I am.

306
00:33:50,883 --> 00:33:55,082
What can we do? We must live our lives.

307
00:33:56,817 --> 00:34:00,316
Yes, we shall live, Uncle Vanya.

308
00:34:01,617 --> 00:34:04,217
We'll live through the long, long days,

309
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,049
and through the long nights.

310
00:34:08,317 --> 00:34:12,116
We'll patiently endure the
trials that fate sends our way.

311
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:17,416
Even if we can't rest,
we'll work for others

312
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,916
both now and when we have grown old.

313
00:34:24,283 --> 00:34:27,416
And when our last hour comes

314
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,716
we'll go quietly.

315
00:34:31,016 --> 00:34:33,749
And in the great beyond, we'll say to Him

316
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:37,249
that we suffered,

317
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:40,916
that we cried

318
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:44,682
that life was hard...

319
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Oto.

320
00:35:25,033 --> 00:35:26,033
Oto.

321
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,466
Oto.

322
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:52,832
Hello?

323
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,532
Please send an ambulance.

324
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:47,016
"Oto Kafuku Funeral Service."

325
00:36:50,883 --> 00:36:53,282
So sudden... a cerebral hemorrhage.

326
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:13,582
For 25 years he's been
pretending to be someone he's not.

327
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:17,816
Look at that swagger, acting
like he's some kind of lord!

328
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,666
(You envy him, don't you.

329
00:37:22,133 --> 00:37:26,066
Yes, I do. I envy him a lot!

330
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:35,032
His first wife, who was my sister,

331
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,166
was a wonderful, kind woman.

332
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,244
And she loved him from
the bottom of her heart,

333
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:50,266
the way an untainted,
noble human loves an angel.

334
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:59,432
And his second wife, as you
can see, is a lovely, smart woman.

335
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,266
Why?

336
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:10,766
(IS SHE FAITHFUL TO HIM?)

337
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,999
Yes, unfortunately.

338
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,000
(WHY UNFORTUNATELY?)

339
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,732
Because

340
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,099
that woman's fidelity

341
00:38:31,617 --> 00:38:33,616
is a lie through and through.

342
00:38:48,317 --> 00:38:49,616
(VANYA...)

343
00:39:01,283 --> 00:39:03,082
(DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.)

344
00:39:05,883 --> 00:39:07,749
(COME ON...)

345
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,716
(SHUT UP, WAFFLES.)

346
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:21,516
(NO, I'll HAVE MY SAY.
MY WIFE TOOK OFF WITH HER LOVER)

347
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
2 years later.

348
00:39:41,733 --> 00:39:43,299
Of course.

349
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:46,032
I'm sure that

350
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:49,066
the truth

351
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,799
no matter what it is,
isn't that frightening.

352
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:59,532
What is most frightening

353
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,366
is not knowing it.

354
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:24,699
"Hiroshima Arts and Culture Theater."

355
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,166
-Are you tired after the long trip?
-Not at all.

356
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,466
Long time no see, Ms. Yuzuhara.

357
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,666
Let me introduce you. Yoon-su
will participate as the dramaturge.

358
00:42:58,633 --> 00:43:00,313
We've exchanged e-mails.

359
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,932
As we explained over e-mail,

360
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:09,616
your residency will be for 2 months
until December, starting today.

361
00:43:09,883 --> 00:43:13,249
6 weeks of rehearsals and
2 weeks of performances.

362
00:43:13,417 --> 00:43:15,950
Auditions will already begin tomorrow.

363
00:43:16,417 --> 00:43:18,649
Here are the audition sheets.

364
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,549
Thank you.

365
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:27,949
We informed theaters around Asia

366
00:43:28,117 --> 00:43:31,573
and received applications
from Korea, China, Hong Kong,

367
00:43:31,717 --> 00:43:34,249
Taiwan and the Philippines.

368
00:43:34,493 --> 00:43:35,493
Yes.

369
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:37,849
I'll interpret Korean.

370
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:42,249
People who can speak English
will communicate with you directly.

371
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
Yes.

372
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:49,500
Actors from overseas were recommended
by the local theaters' program directors.

373
00:43:49,717 --> 00:43:53,301
And we also received many
applications from within Japan.

374
00:43:53,517 --> 00:43:56,082
Even I recognize some faces.

375
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,082
I'll have a look. Can't wait.

376
00:44:01,283 --> 00:44:03,350
Now let's go to your residence.

377
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:09,382
We found a place about an hour
away by car, just like you requested.

378
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:10,716
Thank you.

379
00:44:10,883 --> 00:44:13,416
On a scenic island, since you're here.

380
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:14,660
An island, huh?

381
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:19,499
Also, we've hired a driver
for you according to our rules.

382
00:44:19,733 --> 00:44:23,966
So our driver will be handling
your car, is that all right?

383
00:44:24,133 --> 00:44:27,299
About that... I'll drive my own car.

384
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:30,699
I've got insurance. Please don't mind me.

385
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,066
This isn't about hospitality, actually.
We can't let you drive.

386
00:44:36,567 --> 00:44:37,610
What do you mean?

387
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,966
An artist ran over a person
by accident in the past.

388
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:43,133
Yes.

389
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,666
It was terrible.
Since then, it's become the rule

390
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:52,032
to provide a driver for our
resident artists, no exceptions.

391
00:44:58,033 --> 00:45:01,866
I go over my lines while I'm driving.

392
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,932
It's an important routine for me.

393
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:09,599
That's why I asked you to book
a hotel some distance away.

394
00:45:09,933 --> 00:45:11,299
We're sorry.

395
00:45:12,133 --> 00:45:15,532
We should have explained
to you more clearly.

396
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:22,099
There's a budget set aside for it,
so the theater festival has to use it.

397
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:31,416
If it concerns you, you're
welcome to test our driver.

398
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:35,882
But don't worry, the
driver is very skilled.

399
00:45:39,617 --> 00:45:40,882
Let's go.

400
00:45:45,383 --> 00:45:47,583
Thank you for your understanding.

401
00:45:58,517 --> 00:46:01,249
I'll follow you in the official car.

402
00:46:04,517 --> 00:46:07,082
She's your driver.

403
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,249
I'm Misaki Watari.

404
00:46:11,717 --> 00:46:14,916
This is Mr. Kafuku, our stage director.

405
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:20,049
The festival hires her every year.
She knows the roads well.

406
00:46:20,383 --> 00:46:22,116
She's an excellent driver.

407
00:46:23,683 --> 00:46:25,516
Nice to meet you.

408
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:33,082
Sorry, but I still haven't agreed
to having you as my driver.

409
00:46:35,367 --> 00:46:37,466
Is a test drive OK with yen?

410
00:46:37,733 --> 00:46:39,132
Yes, of course.

411
00:46:39,633 --> 00:46:41,666
No, I'll drive after all.

412
00:46:43,733 --> 00:46:45,132
I'm sorry.

413
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:49,532
Is it because I'm a young woman?

414
00:46:51,233 --> 00:46:53,332
That's not why.

415
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,699
This car is pretty old and has quirks.
It's not easy the first time.

416
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:00,932
Very well.

417
00:47:01,667 --> 00:47:06,466
Then if you sense any danger
in my driving, you take the wheel.

418
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,400
How does that sound?

419
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,500
Do you prefer the passenger seat?

420
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,010
Any problems with

421
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,827
the electrical components?

422
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:04,416
No, none.

423
00:48:04,717 --> 00:48:09,116
Sorry, but you said it was an
old car, so I had to make sure.

424
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:12,584
I've driven it 15 years and no problems.

425
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:14,382
I see.

426
00:49:51,933 --> 00:49:54,133
Could you play the cassette tape?

427
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:57,632
The cassette tape?

428
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:01,832
Yes.

429
00:50:06,883 --> 00:50:08,782
I'm leaving.

430
00:50:10,483 --> 00:50:15,582
Vanya, please just drop it.
Do you hear me?

431
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:17,450
I refuse.

432
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:22,049
Wait, I'm not done yet.

433
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:25,649
You destroyed my life.

434
00:50:26,283 --> 00:50:28,549
I've never lived.

435
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:30,950
Because of you,

436
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:35,849
I wasted the best years
of my life and spoiled them.

437
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:40,449
You're my foe. My bitter enemy.

438
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,749
You fool.

439
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:49,782
If this estate is yours, then take it.

440
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:52,582
I don't want it.

441
00:50:55,183 --> 00:51:01,016
I'm leaving right now. This is like hell.

442
00:51:02,117 --> 00:51:03,782
I can't stand it.

443
00:51:05,883 --> 00:51:10,482
I'm gifted and intelligent.
Courageous, too.

444
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:16,466
If I'd lived normally, I might have been
another Schopenhauer or Dostoevsky.

445
00:51:16,733 --> 00:51:18,410
I'm sick of this nonsense.

446
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,166
I'm losing my mind.

447
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,366
Mother, I can't take it anymore.

448
00:51:24,633 --> 00:51:26,832
Listen to the professor.

449
00:51:28,533 --> 00:51:30,899
Mother, what should I do?

450
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,232
No, never mind. Don't say anything.
I know what to do.

451
00:51:36,533 --> 00:51:39,132
I'll make you pay for this.

452
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,432
Oh, I'll do it.

453
00:52:53,783 --> 00:52:55,223
What do you think?

454
00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:00,116
The Setouchi sea is tranquil and lovely.

455
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,516
Her driving, I mean.

456
00:53:14,617 --> 00:53:18,782
I'll come pick you up at 8 a.m.
tomorrow morning.

457
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:23,416
OK. Sorry it's so early.

458
00:53:23,683 --> 00:53:25,149
No problem.

459
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:44,463
Shall I play the tape?

460
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:46,749
Yes, please.

461
00:54:52,983 --> 00:54:55,916
Uncle, are you crying.

462
00:54:58,417 --> 00:55:02,616
I'm not crying. It's nothing.
Don't be ridiculous.

463
00:55:03,483 --> 00:55:08,949
Your eyes when you looked at me
now looked exactly like your dead mother.

464
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:12,849
Oh, Sonya. Your mother,

465
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:16,116
my sister, where is she now?

466
00:55:21,383 --> 00:55:24,082
You've been ill for such a long time.

467
00:55:25,217 --> 00:55:28,682
Sonya's mother Vera used to stay awake

468
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,016
at night for you, too.

469
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:34,916
She must have been so worried.

470
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:37,049
(LET'S GO, MARINA.)

471
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:40,916
Hey, I haven't finished my lines yet.

472
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:42,416
Oh, well.

473
00:55:43,183 --> 00:55:49,082
My own feet are in pain as well.
Such a throbbing pain.

474
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,000
-Ok, thank you very much.
-Thank you.

475
00:56:07,233 --> 00:56:09,132
Next, please.

476
00:56:14,233 --> 00:56:15,632
Excuse me.

477
00:56:38,467 --> 00:56:41,432
Koji Takatsuki. I'm trying out for Astrov.

478
00:56:49,267 --> 00:56:53,410
You both requested the same
scene, so enact it as a pair.

479
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,000
Yes.

480
00:56:56,067 --> 00:56:58,799
So she's Yelena, and where from?

481
00:57:00,983 --> 00:57:03,050
From "You are a cunning woman."

482
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:04,250
Yes.

483
00:57:08,117 --> 00:57:12,341
I don't understand what she's saying.
Is it OK if I try to wing it?

484
00:57:12,783 --> 00:57:15,250
Yes, go ahead. Whenever you're ready.

485
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:41,882
Oh, you are a cunning woman!

486
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,427
(WHAT DO YOU MEAN?)

487
00:57:43,517 --> 00:57:44,960
How cunning you are!

488
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:49,916
Assuming Sonya is suffering,
let's set that aside for now.

489
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:51,083
But..

490
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:53,193
(WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?)

491
00:57:53,283 --> 00:57:55,049
You know perfectly well

492
00:57:55,917 --> 00:57:58,849
why I come here every day.

493
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:03,016
You know why and for whose sake I come!

494
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:07,482
You're a tigress! My sweet...(A TIGRESS?)

495
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,570
(WHAT DO YOU MEAN?)

496
00:58:10,017 --> 00:58:14,232
A sleek, enchanting tigress.

497
00:58:16,067 --> 00:58:17,643
You must have your victims!

498
00:58:17,733 --> 00:58:19,666
(ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?)

499
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,866
How coy you are.

500
00:58:25,533 --> 00:58:28,333
(I'M NOT THE KIND OF
WOMAN YOU THINK I AM.)

501
00:58:28,633 --> 00:58:30,310
(I SWEAR, I'M NOT THAT VULGAR.)

502
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,832
No need to swear. Don't waste words.

503
00:58:34,867 --> 00:58:36,566
You're so beautiful.

504
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,666
Such lovely hands.

505
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,766
(ENOUGH OF THIS!)

506
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,999
Listen to me.

507
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,632
This is fate, it's inevitable.

508
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,532
(PLEASE STOP THIS.)

509
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,999
(LET GO OF ME.)

510
00:58:59,633 --> 00:59:02,932
Meet me in the forest tomorrow.

511
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,332
At 2 o'clock.

512
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,166
All right? Be there.

513
00:59:08,433 --> 00:59:09,666
Be there, OK?

514
00:59:09,833 --> 00:59:11,266
(LET ME GO!)

515
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:22,060
That's enough. Sorry about that.

516
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,900
Thanks.

517
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:51,282
The next person is the last one.
She's a bit different.

518
00:59:54,117 --> 00:59:55,449
(COME IN.)

519
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,382
She's Lee Yoon-A.

520
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:28,382
She's saying she uses
Korean sign language.

521
01:00:29,017 --> 01:00:30,457
You understand it?

522
01:00:30,967 --> 01:00:32,132
Yes.

523
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:37,166
(NOBODY ELSE CHOSE THIS
SCENE, SO YOU'LL AUDITION ALONE.)

524
01:00:38,867 --> 01:00:40,799
She can hear.

525
01:00:41,133 --> 01:00:44,566
I'll translate in Korean if necessary.

526
01:00:44,967 --> 01:00:46,210
Will that be OK?

527
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,800
Yes.

528
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:50,933
(PLEASE BEGIN).

529
01:01:07,633 --> 01:01:11,866
Uncle Vanya, did you take the morphine?

530
01:01:12,867 --> 01:01:14,499
Give it back.

531
01:01:18,367 --> 01:01:20,466
Why do you make us worry?

532
01:01:21,667 --> 01:01:23,400
Give it back, Uncle Vanya.

533
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:34,032
My misfortune could
perhaps be greater than yours,

534
01:01:34,933 --> 01:01:37,266
but I don't give in to despair.

535
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:45,949
Until my life comes to a
natural end, I'll keep enduring it.

536
01:01:46,883 --> 01:01:48,316
So,

537
01:01:50,417 --> 01:01:53,149
you must endure yours, too.

538
01:02:04,317 --> 01:02:07,216
My dear and only Uncle.

539
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Please.

540
01:02:15,517 --> 01:02:16,849
Give it back.

541
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:24,682
Have pity on us.

542
01:02:26,283 --> 01:02:31,582
You must endure your sorrow.

543
01:02:41,683 --> 01:02:42,949
Thank you.

544
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,732
Not too many auditioned
for the part of Vanya.

545
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,699
You're right.

546
01:03:20,933 --> 01:03:25,932
Everyone probably thinks
you'll be playing the role.

547
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,116
Sorry, it's so late.

548
01:03:59,417 --> 01:04:00,582
No problem.

549
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:01,016
Serebryakov, Roy Lucelo.

550
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:03,582
Yelena, Janice Chang.

551
01:05:04,183 --> 01:05:06,349
Sonya, Lee Yoon-A.

552
01:05:06,817 --> 01:05:09,299
Voynitskaya, Kaoru Komagata.

553
01:05:10,133 --> 01:05:13,399
Vanya, Koji Takatsuki.

554
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,399
Astrov, Ryu Jeong-Eui.

555
01:05:18,133 --> 01:05:20,366
Telegin, Takashi Kimura.

556
01:05:21,067 --> 01:05:23,332
Marina, Yumi Eto.

557
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,799
Excuse me. You want me to play Vanya?

558
01:05:31,367 --> 01:05:32,499
Yes.

559
01:05:32,867 --> 01:05:34,732
There's quite an age-gap.

560
01:05:36,533 --> 01:05:41,466
You can wear make-up. Everyone's
role doesn't match their actual age.

561
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:47,134
If уош'гe unwilling, then don't sign.

562
01:05:47,667 --> 01:05:49,867
The role will go to someone else.

563
01:05:50,967 --> 01:05:55,099
When you finish signing,
we'll start reading the script.

564
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:18,949
(SUPERB! HOW WONDERFUL!)

565
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:22,049
(WHAT A STUNNING VIEW.)

566
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:29,249
The view is indeed
wonderful, your Excellency.

567
01:06:29,717 --> 01:06:33,482
Mr. Kimura, please say it slower.

568
01:06:33,817 --> 01:06:35,649
-Slower than that?
-Yes,

569
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:40,082
And enunciate more clearly
so that everyone can hear.

570
01:06:41,417 --> 01:06:42,417
OK.

571
01:06:42,717 --> 01:06:43,982
Continue.

572
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:52,882
The view is indeed
wonderful, your Excellency.

573
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:14,216
Ladies and gentlemen, tea is ready.

574
01:07:16,383 --> 01:07:18,616
(IF YOU DON'T MIND...)

575
01:07:19,117 --> 01:07:21,549
(HUSH, SOMEONE WILL HEAR YOU.)

576
01:07:22,383 --> 01:07:26,716
No, let me say that I love you.
Don't drive me away.

577
01:07:26,883 --> 01:07:28,999
That's all I need to be happy.

578
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:32,899
(I CAN'T STAND THIS.)

579
01:07:40,133 --> 01:07:43,732
Thank you. Let's stop here for today.
Good work.

580
01:08:01,533 --> 01:08:02,966
Aren't you cold?

581
01:08:04,533 --> 01:08:05,966
Not at all.

582
01:08:14,933 --> 01:08:16,053
From now on...

583
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,666
Yes?

584
01:08:19,133 --> 01:08:22,632
Could you wait in the
car when I'm running late?

585
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:27,353
I feel uncomfortable knowing
you're waiting in the cold.

586
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,432
No, thank you.

587
01:08:32,433 --> 01:08:35,832
I know you cherish
this car, so I can't relax.

588
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:40,550
If you know that, then it's no problem.

589
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:44,049
Just smoke outside.

590
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:50,148
Fine, then.
Only when it's really too cold.

591
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:54,749
Shall I play the tape?

592
01:08:55,649 --> 01:08:56,816
Yes.

593
01:09:01,417 --> 01:09:07,316
But allow me, as an old man, give
one word of advice before parting.

594
01:09:09,683 --> 01:09:15,049
Everyone, the important thing is to work.

595
01:09:16,383 --> 01:09:18,916
You must keep working.

596
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:06,866
Mr. Kafuku.

597
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:15,132
Could I invite you out for a drink?
My car is here, too.

598
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:17,499
You're driving?

599
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:22,632
Yes, so if you don't mind,
how about the bar at my hotel?

600
01:10:24,667 --> 01:10:26,199
I'll be a bit late.

601
01:10:26,767 --> 01:10:28,099
No problem.

602
01:10:28,367 --> 01:10:31,099
I'll bring my car around, then.

603
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,799
Please follow me.

604
01:10:50,867 --> 01:10:54,766
I actually sometimes do a
search on your name online.

605
01:10:56,983 --> 01:10:59,316
That's how I found this audition

606
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:03,416
and that day was the deadline.
Isn't that amazing?

607
01:11:04,917 --> 01:11:06,850
Why are you interested in me?

608
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:10,916
I really liked acting
out Oto's screenplays.

609
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:14,549
Saying her lines made me happy.

610
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:20,416
My theater projects and Oto's
screenplays are different things.

611
01:11:20,717 --> 01:11:22,049
Yes.

612
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:25,116
But when I saw your play that time,

613
01:11:25,317 --> 01:11:31,249
I felt that what you two were doing
were the same, albeit in different ways.

614
01:11:31,683 --> 01:11:33,082
How so?

615
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:37,682
Tough question.

616
01:11:39,017 --> 01:11:42,216
I get the feeling that you both value

617
01:11:42,517 --> 01:11:45,849
the finer details that
people won't even notice.

618
01:11:49,183 --> 01:11:52,049
I actually like things like that.

619
01:11:53,383 --> 01:11:57,516
But I wouldn't have known if I
hadn't acted out Oto's scripts.

620
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:04,849
When I saw the casting call, I
knew this was my only chance.

621
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:11,532
I'm not sure if you know,
but I'm working freelance now.

622
01:12:13,133 --> 01:12:17,166
I know. Though in my case
I didn't have to look you up.

623
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:19,299
Is that so.

624
01:12:20,133 --> 01:12:22,199
That's embarrassing.

625
01:12:22,967 --> 01:12:24,232
How stupid.

626
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,066
You were a star.

627
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,399
No, I was framed.

628
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,200
Do you do things like that often?

629
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,360
Things like what?

630
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,932
With women you barely know.

631
01:12:41,433 --> 01:12:42,832
Don't you?

632
01:12:43,433 --> 01:12:44,433
No.

633
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,632
Lots of women must approach you, too.

634
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:50,132
All you have to do is say no.

635
01:12:50,433 --> 01:12:53,799
I don't do it with just anybody, either.

636
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:58,966
If you click and want to get
to know her better... Not ever?

637
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:02,332
Sex isn't the only way
to get to know someone.

638
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:05,632
But some things you
can't know unless you do it.

639
01:13:05,967 --> 01:13:08,266
-Like what?
-Like.

640
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,177
What's the matter?

641
01:13:14,267 --> 01:13:15,616
Just that..

642
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:19,282
Why am I talking to you about this?

643
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:26,449
Oto must have been happy
with a husband like you.

644
01:13:29,050 --> 01:13:30,482
I wonder.

645
01:13:32,483 --> 01:13:37,449
If you don't mind, could you
tell me something about her?

646
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:40,050
Something about her?

647
01:13:40,383 --> 01:13:42,216
How you two met,

648
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:44,816
how she wrote her screenplays,

649
01:13:45,117 --> 01:13:47,816
everyday conversations. Anything.

650
01:13:52,083 --> 01:13:53,950
Here's what you're thinking.

651
01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:58,549
"He and I share the same pain, because..."

652
01:13:59,883 --> 01:14:02,000
"We loved the same woman."

653
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:06,882
Oh please.
Mine was just an unrequited longing.

654
01:14:07,917 --> 01:14:10,249
You were in love with her.

655
01:14:12,117 --> 01:14:13,616
I don't deny it.

656
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:17,082
She was lovely. Very much so.

657
01:14:21,383 --> 01:14:22,649
Yeah.

658
01:14:23,017 --> 01:14:27,699
So I'm jealous of you, Mr. Kafuku.

659
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:30,166
Forgive me.

660
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:33,966
You're jealous

661
01:14:34,833 --> 01:14:36,032
of me?

662
01:14:46,367 --> 01:14:47,666
Excuse me.

663
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:51,400
You took a picture, didn't you?

664
01:14:55,167 --> 01:14:56,847
You took one just now.

665
01:14:57,267 --> 01:14:58,632
Delete it.

666
01:14:58,967 --> 01:15:00,767
What's the matter with you?

667
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,132
I'm leaving now.

668
01:15:06,967 --> 01:15:07,967
Yes.

669
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:11,432
-The check, please.
-Yes, sir.

670
01:15:29,933 --> 01:15:31,466
I'm sorry.

671
01:15:32,133 --> 01:15:33,916
I invited you today.

672
01:15:34,417 --> 01:15:35,616
It's OK.

673
01:15:37,217 --> 01:15:42,549
I'm glad to be here now, to be
able to perform under your direction.

674
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:46,416
I believe Oto brought us together.

675
01:15:48,217 --> 01:15:51,716
I look forward to working
with you again from tomorrow.

676
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:57,149
Yeah. See you tomorrow.

677
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:21,882
What's the matter? You look so glum.

678
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:26,282
Is it because you feel
sorry for that professor?

679
01:16:27,617 --> 01:16:29,682
Leave me alone.

680
01:16:31,083 --> 01:16:35,416
(OR BECAUSE YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HIS WIFE?)

681
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:39,349
She's a good friend of mine.

682
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:42,249
(ALREADY?)

683
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:46,277
What do you mean by "already"?

684
01:16:46,367 --> 01:16:48,243
Stop.

685
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:50,199
Still too much emotion?

686
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,532
Ryu I's doing it right.
Emulate him. Continue.

687
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:03,366
(THERE'S A PROPER ORDER FOR A
WOMAN TO BECOME A MAN'S FRIEND.)

688
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:06,466
(FIRST, SHE'S AN ACQUAINTANCE, )

689
01:17:06,667 --> 01:17:11,899
(THEN SHE'S LOVER, AND FINALLY,
SHE BECOMES A GOOD FRIEND.)

690
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,866
What a banal philosophy.

691
01:17:15,067 --> 01:17:16,366
Takatsuki.

692
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:22,699
Try focusing on your text.
All you have to do is read it.

693
01:17:51,067 --> 01:17:53,000
From where we left off, then.

694
01:18:11,483 --> 01:18:14,982
I didn't get him? I missed again?

695
01:18:15,217 --> 01:18:16,449
Damn it.

696
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:19,316
God damn it.

697
01:18:20,917 --> 01:18:25,049
(GET ME OUT OF HERE. KILL ME IF YOU MUST.)

698
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:27,349
(I CAN'T STAY HERE ANYMORE.)

699
01:18:28,783 --> 01:18:33,449
What's wrong with me? What am I doing?

700
01:18:45,717 --> 01:18:48,416
Good work, everyone.

701
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:54,900
Mr. Kafuku.

702
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Yes?

703
01:18:56,100 --> 01:19:00,293
Could we do a little interview
for the festival website?

704
01:19:00,383 --> 01:19:01,793
Yes.

705
01:19:01,883 --> 01:19:04,632
We need a video, so somewhere outside.

706
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:26,199
All we do is read the text.

707
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:29,499
When will we start moving?

708
01:19:29,867 --> 01:19:33,366
Honestly, the foreign
language-parts lull me to sleep.

709
01:19:33,567 --> 01:19:36,132
-Me too!
-Me too.

710
01:19:36,567 --> 01:19:41,166
-Though not in a bad way.
-Yeah, it's like hearing a sutra.

711
01:19:41,467 --> 01:19:45,199
Sounds like a blessing
when you put it that way.

712
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:54,932
Yoon-su, where did you learn Japanese?

713
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,266
I studied Noh in graduate school
at Waseda University for 2 years.

714
01:20:02,367 --> 01:20:07,799
Korean, English, Japanese, and
sign language. That's awesome.

715
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:14,482
Japanese and Korean have similar grammar,
so learning the vocabulary is enough.

716
01:20:14,783 --> 01:20:17,316
I've liked English from a young age.

717
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:20,250
When did you learn sign language?

718
01:20:23,217 --> 01:20:27,949
Mr. Kafuku, you kindly
offered to take me home.

719
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:32,049
May I invite you over for dinner today?

720
01:20:32,883 --> 01:20:35,116
No, I don't want to intrude.

721
01:20:36,817 --> 01:20:40,416
There's something I have
to apologize to you about.

722
01:20:41,150 --> 01:20:44,017
-What is it?
-You'll know when we get there.

723
01:21:09,517 --> 01:21:12,016
Both of you, please come inside.

724
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:27,699
Let's go. He probably doesn't feel
comfortable making you wait hungry.

725
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:31,666
There's no need to worry about that.

726
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:35,332
I wouldn't worry. But I'm sure he will.

727
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,366
Come on.

728
01:21:57,533 --> 01:21:58,966
My wife.

729
01:22:48,983 --> 01:22:50,882
She says it looks like me.

730
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:53,382
That's mean.

731
01:22:56,317 --> 01:23:00,716
These potatoes are from the back yard.
She grew them.

732
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:09,182
This Is what I wanted to
apologize to you about.

733
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:12,549
Why didn't you tell me?

734
01:23:12,917 --> 01:23:18,082
She worried you might find it hard to
reject her, if you knew she was my wife.

735
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:19,660
No, I...

736
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:21,849
You wouldn't mind, I can tell.

737
01:23:22,083 --> 01:23:25,516
But silence is golden.

738
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:33,349
To answer your question, I learned
sign language after meeting her.

739
01:23:34,117 --> 01:23:37,182
I wanted to know her
language so I learned it.

740
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:40,263
That's really something.

741
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:42,999
She's originally a dancer,

742
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:49,366
and I was the coordinator when her
dance company performed in Busan.

743
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,400
Love at first sight.

744
01:23:54,533 --> 01:23:56,032
Don't tell her.

745
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:01,032
Why Hiroshima?

746
01:24:03,133 --> 01:24:06,269
I was invited to the
theater festival 3 years ago.

747
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,299
And Yoon-A came with you?

748
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:16,399
Yes. When I got the offer, I debated
whether or not she should come along.

749
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,599
In Korea, she has family and
friends who know sign language.

750
01:24:22,767 --> 01:24:25,466
I thought she would be lonely here.

751
01:24:25,767 --> 01:24:30,666
But I figured I could listen
to her like a hundred people.

752
01:24:31,167 --> 01:24:35,332
I felt that I'm the only
one, who could support her.

753
01:24:51,117 --> 01:24:53,949
Why did you decide to audition?

754
01:25:19,117 --> 01:25:22,182
"I got pregnant and took
time off from dancing,"

755
01:25:22,683 --> 01:25:25,816
"but had a miscarriage."

756
01:25:46,617 --> 01:25:50,749
"Although I wanted to work
again, my body refused to dance."

757
01:25:51,083 --> 01:25:56,249
"That was when my husband told
me about you and suggested I try it."

758
01:25:57,683 --> 01:25:59,482
Thank you.

759
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:02,967
Is there anything hard about rehearsals?

760
01:26:19,233 --> 01:26:23,166
"Why do you ask me something,
that you don't ask others?"

761
01:26:23,567 --> 01:26:27,599
"You don't have to be nicer to
me than you are to other people."

762
01:26:34,867 --> 01:26:39,366
"People not understanding
my words is normal for me."

763
01:27:00,433 --> 01:27:03,899
"But I can see and hear."

764
01:27:04,233 --> 01:27:07,699
"Sometimes I can understand
a lot more than words."

765
01:27:08,067 --> 01:27:11,749
"That's what's important
in our rehearsals, right?"

766
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:14,982
Yes.

767
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:42,949
"So right now, every day is so much fun."

768
01:27:43,417 --> 01:27:46,849
"Chekhov's text comes inside me and"

769
01:27:47,150 --> 01:27:49,816
"moves my body that was stuck before."

770
01:27:56,017 --> 01:27:59,282
"I'm glad I got my courage up."

771
01:28:01,317 --> 01:28:02,849
Glad to hear that.

772
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:10,782
Do you like spicy food?

773
01:28:11,317 --> 01:28:13,449
Yes. It's good.

774
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:28,232
How's her driving?

775
01:28:33,233 --> 01:28:35,332
It's fabulous.

776
01:28:38,167 --> 01:28:42,266
She speeds up and slows down
so smoothly, I hardly feel gravity.

777
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,766
Sometimes I forget I'm in a car.

778
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:53,599
I've experienced many people's
driving, but it's never been so pleasant.

779
01:28:57,700 --> 01:29:02,066
I'm glad she was assigned
as my driver is how I feel now.

780
01:29:44,017 --> 01:29:48,616
"Compliment us actors as
much for once," she says.

781
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:57,316
This means, "to compliment"?

782
01:29:57,483 --> 01:29:58,682
Yes.

783
01:30:40,733 --> 01:30:44,299
Thank you for inviting me.

784
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,166
It was Yoon-su who invited us.

785
01:30:49,567 --> 01:30:51,466
They were a lovely couple.

786
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,777
Now I'm curious about your rehearsals.

787
01:30:56,867 --> 01:30:58,432
Yoon-A's Sonya.

788
01:31:02,367 --> 01:31:06,832
I've been hearing your tape,
so I kept thinking, "She's Sonya."

789
01:31:09,167 --> 01:31:10,847
You're welcome to watch.

790
01:31:11,433 --> 01:31:14,832
No, thank you. I'm sorry.

791
01:31:15,033 --> 01:31:17,700
-Come watch us...
-Shall I play the tape?

792
01:31:18,433 --> 01:31:19,699
Yeah.

793
01:31:24,767 --> 01:31:29,499
Vanya, you're educated and intelligent,

794
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,666
so you must surely understand

795
01:31:33,700 --> 01:31:37,399
that the world isn't
destroyed by villains...

796
01:31:37,667 --> 01:31:40,099
Don't you get sick of hearing this?

797
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:42,566
No.

798
01:31:43,367 --> 01:31:45,499
I like this voice is why.

799
01:31:47,367 --> 01:31:48,682
See.

800
01:31:50,217 --> 01:31:51,716
Whose voice is it?

801
01:31:56,183 --> 01:31:57,582
My wife.

802
01:31:58,417 --> 01:31:59,649
Oh.

803
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:07,616
The flow of the entire play has
to be memorized with my method.

804
01:32:08,017 --> 01:32:10,150
So I listen to it over and over.

805
01:32:10,683 --> 01:32:15,782
I acted in Uncle Vanya before,
so Vanya's parts are left out.

806
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:20,487
When I say my line at my pace,
the next line starts precisely.

807
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:22,249
Wow.

808
01:32:24,017 --> 01:32:25,916
What I said before is true.

809
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:32,182
I forget that I'm in the car
and forget that you're here.

810
01:32:33,117 --> 01:32:34,637
Annoying, isn't it?

811
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:37,682
No, it's your job.

812
01:32:41,417 --> 01:32:43,649
Where did you learn to drive?

813
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:48,182
My hometown.

814
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:52,149
Kami-junitaki Village in Hokkaido,

815
01:32:52,350 --> 01:32:54,816
where you need a car to do anything.

816
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:56,749
Oh.

817
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:59,966
My mother taught me to drive,

818
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,833
and I've done it since junior high.

819
01:33:04,133 --> 01:33:05,499
Junior high?

820
01:33:05,767 --> 01:33:06,832
Yes.

821
01:33:07,267 --> 01:33:10,732
My mother worked at
a nightclub in Sapporo.

822
01:33:12,233 --> 01:33:15,369
She took a train there,
so ever since junior high.

823
01:33:15,833 --> 01:33:18,732
I drove her to and from our local station.

824
01:33:22,833 --> 01:33:25,299
The station was an hour away.

825
01:33:26,433 --> 01:33:30,799
We left the house at 5 p.m.
and I picked her up at 7 a.m.

826
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:34,666
During those two hours,

827
01:33:35,633 --> 01:33:38,066
my mother wanted to sleep.

828
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:43,432
If I woke her with my driving,
she'd kick me in the back

829
01:33:44,167 --> 01:33:46,099
and hit me when we arrived.

830
01:33:46,967 --> 01:33:47,999
That's how.

831
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:53,266
I learned to drive over bad
roads without waking her.

832
01:33:57,233 --> 01:33:58,632
I see.

833
01:34:02,767 --> 01:34:06,543
What you said made me very happy.

834
01:34:06,633 --> 01:34:09,000
No.

835
01:34:10,317 --> 01:34:14,816
I'm grateful to my mother
for teaching me how to drive.

836
01:34:16,483 --> 01:34:21,582
It was for her own sake, but the
way she taught me was thorough.

837
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:24,982
I see.

838
01:34:25,583 --> 01:34:26,816
Yes.

839
01:34:28,583 --> 01:34:31,116
No doubt it must have been so.

840
01:35:47,567 --> 01:35:51,466
Will you tell me the
whole truth afterwards?

841
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:58,166
Yes, of course.

842
01:35:59,233 --> 01:36:03,999
I'm sure that the truth,

843
01:36:04,333 --> 01:36:08,232
no matter what it is,
isn't that frightening.

844
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:12,132
What is most frightening

845
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:15,299
is not knowing it.

846
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:28,882
Oh, to flirt with a man like him
and to lose oneself in his arms.

847
01:36:31,117 --> 01:36:35,482
I guess, I'm a bit in love with him too.

848
01:36:37,450 --> 01:36:42,249
Yes, I miss him when he doesn't come...

849
01:36:43,883 --> 01:36:45,949
(MY CONSCIENCE TORTURES ME)

850
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:50,082
(AS IF I'D KILLED THAT MAN).

851
01:36:51,450 --> 01:36:53,116
(I SIT DOWN, AND...)

852
01:36:55,983 --> 01:37:00,582
(CLOSE MY EYES LIKE THIS, AND THINK...)

853
01:37:03,717 --> 01:37:07,516
(WILL THE PEOPLE LIVING
200 OR 300 YEARS FROM NOW, )

854
01:37:08,850 --> 01:37:12,582
(THE ONES WE'RE CURRENTLY
CLEARING THE WAY FOR, )

855
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:16,549
(WILL THEY REMEMBER US AND BE GRATEFUL?)

856
01:37:20,283 --> 01:37:22,516
(THEY'LL ALL COMPLETELY FORGET.)

857
01:37:23,683 --> 01:37:31,683
People might forget, but
God will surely commend you.

858
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:38,000
(THANKS. THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.)

859
01:37:41,833 --> 01:37:43,399
Sorry we're late.

860
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:47,532
Either Vanya or Yelena is in most scenes.

861
01:37:48,367 --> 01:37:52,399
We kept repeating the same
ones and started the walk-through.

862
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:54,700
I'm very sorry.

863
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:58,332
It was for the best, actually.

864
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:01,367
Why don't you two move a bit as well?

865
01:38:11,367 --> 01:38:16,332
My life is lost, there's no turning back.

866
01:38:17,833 --> 01:38:22,966
That thought haunts me like
an evil spirit day and night.

867
01:38:24,133 --> 01:38:28,099
My past went by wfthouf event.
It's unimportant.

868
01:38:28,367 --> 01:38:31,699
But the present is worse.

869
01:38:32,467 --> 01:38:36,832
What should I do about
my life and my love?

870
01:38:37,867 --> 01:38:40,032
What happened?

871
01:38:44,983 --> 01:38:48,449
(YOU SAY SUCH THINGS, BUT I DON'T KNOW...)

872
01:38:49,317 --> 01:38:50,782
(WHAT TO DO.)

873
01:38:52,650 --> 01:38:54,716
(I'M SORRY IS ALL I CAN SAY.)

874
01:38:55,217 --> 01:38:58,216
(FORGIVE ME. GOOD NIGHT.)

875
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:00,550
Please understand...

876
01:40:35,267 --> 01:40:36,866
(WHO'S THERE?)

877
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,199
(IS IT YOU, SONYA?)

878
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:41,699
(IT'S ME.)

879
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,532
Mr. Kafuku.

880
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,282
I'm very sorry about today.

881
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:09,316
Never mind.

882
01:41:10,317 --> 01:41:14,382
I was just lending her an ear.

883
01:41:14,983 --> 01:41:19,049
You say that, but you can't
speak English or Mandarin.

884
01:41:19,417 --> 01:41:21,616
She doesn't speak Japanese.

885
01:41:22,217 --> 01:41:23,482
Right.

886
01:41:24,750 --> 01:41:27,449
So we ended up..

887
01:41:29,617 --> 01:41:31,800
Use good judgment.

888
01:41:33,383 --> 01:41:34,982
I'm sorry.

889
01:41:38,617 --> 01:41:40,297
That's all I have to say.

890
01:42:07,850 --> 01:42:10,382
Could you keep driving somewhere?

891
01:42:12,117 --> 01:42:13,616
Somewhere?

892
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:18,000
I still haven't seen much of Hiroshima.

893
01:42:18,167 --> 01:42:20,232
Some place you like is fine.

894
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:26,032
All right.

895
01:43:14,633 --> 01:43:17,866
Isn't it kind of like snow?

896
01:43:51,283 --> 01:43:54,716
Straight down that way is
the Peace Memorial Park.

897
01:43:56,583 --> 01:44:01,816
The line between the A-Bomb Dome and the
Cenotaph is called the "axis of peace."

898
01:44:04,217 --> 01:44:08,416
The architect who designed
this facility created this atrium

899
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:14,282
so that the line would continue on
to the sea without being severed.

900
01:44:19,583 --> 01:44:21,583
Why did you come to Hiroshima?

901
01:44:24,350 --> 01:44:26,882
Wait, never mind.

902
01:44:31,583 --> 01:44:33,732
Behind our house was a hill.

903
01:44:36,067 --> 01:44:37,332
5 years ago,

904
01:44:38,267 --> 01:44:42,832
a landslide occurred and our
house was destroyed by the debris.

905
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:46,899
My mother died in that accident.

906
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:54,632
I'd turned 18 years old right before then,

907
01:44:55,067 --> 01:44:58,395
and had just officially
obtained my driver's license.

908
01:45:01,633 --> 01:45:06,166
The car was intact, so I left
home in it after her funeral.

909
01:45:08,033 --> 01:45:10,999
So you're 23 years old now.

910
01:45:11,667 --> 01:45:12,899
Yes.

911
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:24,866
I had nowhere to go, so I
just kept heading out west.

912
01:45:26,667 --> 01:45:31,332
But my car broke down in
Hiroshima, and I had no money to fix it.

913
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:37,632
So I began driving those garbage trucks.

914
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,533
Driving is the only thing I can do.

915
01:45:49,050 --> 01:45:50,982
Do you plan on staying here?

916
01:45:52,083 --> 01:45:53,649
I don't know.

917
01:45:55,983 --> 01:45:58,749
My last name, Watari, is from my father,

918
01:46:00,717 --> 01:46:03,250
and it's common Shimane and Hiroshima.

919
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:09,282
Though I've never met him
and don't even know if he's alive.

920
01:46:10,783 --> 01:46:12,382
I see.

921
01:46:53,667 --> 01:46:55,666
Your last name, Kafuku,

922
01:46:56,667 --> 01:47:00,299
is uncommon, isn't it?
Written, "house" and "good luck."

923
01:47:01,333 --> 01:47:02,613
It's auspicious.

924
01:47:06,833 --> 01:47:09,733
My wife said the same
thing before we married.

925
01:47:12,033 --> 01:47:14,232
My wife's name is Oto.

926
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:15,700
Oto.

927
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:17,566
Oto, as in "sound."

928
01:47:18,533 --> 01:47:22,032
Oto Kafuku. What a name.

929
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:27,272
The primary reason why
she hesitated marrying me.

930
01:47:27,967 --> 01:47:30,634
Her name would be "House of the Gospel."

931
01:47:35,867 --> 01:47:37,666
She died 2 years ago.

932
01:47:41,933 --> 01:47:43,799
Cerebral hemorrhage.

933
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:49,299
She was on the floor when I got home,

934
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,400
and never regained consciousness.

935
01:47:59,267 --> 01:48:01,467
Does that tape creep you out now?

936
01:48:03,483 --> 01:48:05,749
No, not at all.

937
01:48:06,917 --> 01:48:08,649
In fact, it's...

938
01:48:15,417 --> 01:48:17,282
Sorry!

939
01:48:22,217 --> 01:48:23,916
Thank you!

940
01:48:29,483 --> 01:48:31,782
I like that car.

941
01:48:33,083 --> 01:48:35,616
Can tell it's been treated with care,

942
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:39,782
so I also want to drive it with care.

943
01:48:45,917 --> 01:48:47,216
Let's go.

944
01:49:09,183 --> 01:49:12,066
There must be something.
I can't take this.

945
01:49:12,433 --> 01:49:14,266
I'm 47 years old.

946
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:18,399
If I live to be 60, that's
13 years I have before me.

947
01:49:19,633 --> 01:49:20,833
That's so long.

948
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:24,999
How am I supposed to
live out those 13 years?

949
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:40,199
Such nice weather.

950
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,699
Yes.

951
01:50:00,133 --> 01:50:01,813
Let's do it over there.

952
01:50:46,983 --> 01:50:48,916
(WHY ARE YOU CRYING?)

953
01:50:49,650 --> 01:50:53,382
I don't know. It's nothing.
I just started tearing up.

954
01:50:55,450 --> 01:50:59,316
(NEVER MIND. SILLY, NOW I'M CRYING TOO.)

955
01:51:01,083 --> 01:51:03,083
(YOU'RE ANGRY WITH ME BECAUSE)

956
01:51:03,583 --> 01:51:06,975
(YOU THINK I PARRIED YOUR
FATHER FOR SELFISH REASONS.)

957
01:51:08,083 --> 01:51:10,127
(I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'LL BELIEVE ME, )

958
01:51:10,217 --> 01:51:11,897
(BUT I SWEAR TO YOU, )

959
01:51:12,083 --> 01:51:14,382
(I MARRIED HIM FOR LOVE.)

960
01:51:15,717 --> 01:51:18,617
(I WAS INFATUATED WITH
THE FAMOUS PROFESSOR.)

961
01:51:19,783 --> 01:51:23,882
(I KNOW NOW THAT THE LOVE
WAS FAKE AND NOT REAL, )

962
01:51:24,383 --> 01:51:26,583
(BUT IT SEEMED REAL AT THE TIME.)

963
01:51:27,350 --> 01:51:29,832
(I COULDN'T HELP IT.)

964
01:51:30,867 --> 01:51:33,943
(BUT YOU'VE GLARED AT ME DISAPPROVINGLY)

965
01:51:34,033 --> 01:51:38,199
(WITH THOSE CLEVER, SUSPICIOUS
EYES EVER SINCE OUR MARRIAGE.)

966
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:41,832
Stop, stop, we made up.

967
01:51:42,233 --> 01:51:43,910
Let's forget the past.

968
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,110
(DON'T LOOK AT OTHERS LIKE THAT.)

969
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:47,777
(IT DOESN'T SUIT YOU.)

970
01:51:47,867 --> 01:51:52,199
(YOU SHOULD TRUST PEOPLE, OR
ELSE LIFE BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE.)

971
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:56,300
Hey.

972
01:51:57,667 --> 01:51:59,199
Tell me hefiestly.

973
01:51:59,633 --> 01:52:02,166
Are you happy?

974
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,032
(NO.)

975
01:52:37,533 --> 01:52:39,516
(I WISH YOU HAPPINESS)

976
01:52:40,850 --> 01:52:43,082
(FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.)

977
01:52:43,683 --> 01:52:48,749
(AS FOR ME, I'M UNIMPORTANT,
LIKE AN ACCESSORY.)

978
01:52:50,217 --> 01:52:54,616
(IN MUSIC, IN MY HUSBAND'S
HOUSE, IN ROMANCE...)

979
01:52:54,817 --> 01:52:59,782
(NO MATTER WHERE I AM,
I'M JUST AN ACCESSORY.)

980
01:53:01,283 --> 01:53:04,449
(TO BE HONEST, SONYA...)

981
01:53:05,883 --> 01:53:10,949
(COME TO THINK OF IT, I'M VERY UNHAPPY.)

982
01:53:12,217 --> 01:53:16,049
(HAPPINESS FOR ME
DOESN'T EXIST IN THIS WORLD.)

983
01:53:19,217 --> 01:53:20,982
(WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?)

984
01:53:22,050 --> 01:53:23,782
I'm happy.

985
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:26,716
I'm just so happy.

986
01:53:29,250 --> 01:53:32,382
(I WANT TO PLAY THE PIANO NOW.)

987
01:53:42,183 --> 01:53:43,516
Do play.

988
01:53:43,683 --> 01:53:45,363
I'd love to hear you.

989
01:54:04,167 --> 01:54:06,132
Something happened just now.

990
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:09,166
But it's still just between actors.

991
01:54:09,367 --> 01:54:11,047
There's the next step.

992
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:13,400
We open it up to the audience.

993
01:54:14,167 --> 01:54:17,299
We recreate that moment
onstage in its entirety.

994
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,000
Let's do Act 3, too.

995
01:54:24,333 --> 01:54:25,532
Takatsuki.

996
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:27,899
Yes.

997
01:54:59,450 --> 01:55:00,649
It's freezing.

998
01:55:00,817 --> 01:55:01,949
Yes.

999
01:55:07,350 --> 01:55:10,149
Thank you for today.

1000
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:12,249
About what?

1001
01:55:13,283 --> 01:55:14,316
Nothing.

1002
01:55:20,583 --> 01:55:22,382
Could we talk?

1003
01:55:24,450 --> 01:55:27,982
If you don't mind, somewhere nearby.
Just for a bit.

1004
01:55:29,583 --> 01:55:31,082
Where's your car?

1005
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:33,350
It's being repaired.

1006
01:56:07,683 --> 01:56:09,032
About today

1007
01:56:10,267 --> 01:56:13,000
what happened?

1008
01:56:13,167 --> 01:56:16,699
Between Janice and Yoon-A.

1009
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:21,067
Only they know the answer to that.

1010
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:27,232
One thing I can say is that this text
has the power to make that happen.

1011
01:56:28,300 --> 01:56:33,066
Mr. Kafuku, why aren't
you playing Vanya yourself?

1012
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:39,199
Chekhov is terrifying.

1013
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:46,799
When you say his lines,
it drags out the real you.

1014
01:56:47,967 --> 01:56:49,407
Don't you feel it?

1015
01:56:51,433 --> 01:56:54,466
I can't bear that anymore.

1016
01:56:55,833 --> 01:57:00,866
Which means I can no longer
yield myself up to this role.

1017
01:57:02,267 --> 01:57:05,499
But then, why me?

1018
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:10,366
I feel out of place in this production.

1019
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:13,533
I'm not suited for this role.

1020
01:57:14,467 --> 01:57:18,616
I'm sure the audience
will feel the same way.

1021
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:25,482
When I auditioned, I was
desperate and in shambles.

1022
01:57:26,183 --> 01:57:28,716
I didn't know what I was doing.

1023
01:57:29,483 --> 01:57:33,782
So why did you choose me?

1024
01:57:38,783 --> 01:57:40,616
Oto brought us together.

1025
01:57:41,083 --> 01:57:44,949
Please, don't be glib. I'm serious.

1026
01:57:45,150 --> 01:57:48,416
I came here to change myself.

1027
01:57:57,983 --> 01:58:00,916
You can't control yourself very well.

1028
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,449
Right.

1029
01:58:08,450 --> 01:58:10,960
From a social standpoint, that's not good.

1030
01:58:11,050 --> 01:58:14,182
But it's not necessarily
a drawback for an actor.

1031
01:58:15,450 --> 01:58:19,249
During your audition and
our sessions, you weren't bad.

1032
01:58:20,583 --> 01:58:23,349
You can yield yourself to your cast mate.

1033
01:58:25,383 --> 01:58:27,732
Do the same to the text.

1034
01:58:28,933 --> 01:58:32,999
Yield yourself and respond to the text.

1035
01:58:33,867 --> 01:58:35,366
Respond to it?

1036
01:58:37,367 --> 01:58:39,499
The text is questioning you.

1037
01:58:39,967 --> 01:58:43,807
If you listen to it and respond,
the same will happen to you.

1038
01:58:52,533 --> 01:58:55,566
Go on ahead. I'll take you to your hotel.

1039
01:58:56,067 --> 01:58:57,232
Check, please.

1040
01:58:58,400 --> 01:58:59,866
Thank you.

1041
01:59:12,767 --> 01:59:15,567
Mr. Kafuku offered to take me to my hotel.

1042
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:18,032
OK, the same as before?

1043
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:23,999
I'll go pay for parking.

1044
01:59:45,817 --> 01:59:47,257
Where's Takatsuki?

1045
01:59:55,250 --> 01:59:58,049
Sorry, let's go.

1046
02:00:29,450 --> 02:00:30,782
Mr. Kafuku.

1047
02:00:33,517 --> 02:00:37,249
I'm empty.

1048
02:00:39,117 --> 02:00:41,049
There's nothing inside me.

1049
02:00:45,050 --> 02:00:47,066
About the text questioning me.

1050
02:00:48,067 --> 02:00:53,266
I think I felt that with
Oto's screenplays.

1051
02:00:55,533 --> 02:00:59,999
I came here because I
wanted to feel it again.

1052
02:01:01,700 --> 02:01:02,999
So.

1053
02:01:05,467 --> 02:01:08,532
That bit about Oto bringing us together

1054
02:01:10,333 --> 02:01:11,999
is true after all.

1055
02:01:15,333 --> 02:01:17,013
I finally understand.

1056
02:01:21,667 --> 02:01:23,499
Oto and I..

1057
02:01:23,967 --> 02:01:25,166
Yes.

1058
02:01:26,533 --> 02:01:28,066
We had a daughter.

1059
02:01:29,833 --> 02:01:32,633
She died from pneumonia when she was four.

1060
02:01:33,333 --> 02:01:35,499
She'd be 23 if she were alive.

1061
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:46,799
Our daughter's death marked
the end of our happy times.

1062
02:01:48,433 --> 02:01:50,166
Oto quit acting.

1063
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:54,032
I quit working in TV
and returned to theater.

1064
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:59,082
Oto was lethargic for years.

1065
02:01:59,850 --> 02:02:04,016
But then she suddenly
began writing stories one day.

1066
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:08,749
No, she began telling them.

1067
02:02:10,617 --> 02:02:12,816
Her first story

1068
02:02:17,217 --> 02:02:19,484
was born after having sex with me.

1069
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:26,916
She suddenly started
narrating it after having sex.

1070
02:02:27,917 --> 02:02:31,282
But the next morning,
her memory was foggy.

1071
02:02:32,883 --> 02:02:35,449
I remembered it all, so I told her.

1072
02:02:36,950 --> 02:02:40,470
She wrote a script based
on it and sent it to a contest.

1073
02:02:41,550 --> 02:02:46,249
It won an award and launched
her career as a screenwriter.

1074
02:02:48,850 --> 02:02:51,849
"That" would strike
her at times after sex.

1075
02:02:53,383 --> 02:02:56,549
She'd tell it to me and
make me remember it.

1076
02:02:57,217 --> 02:03:01,916
The next morning, I'd tell her.
She'd take notes.

1077
02:03:03,283 --> 02:03:05,550
Eventually that became our custom.

1078
02:03:07,333 --> 02:03:10,832
Sex and her stories
were strongly connected.

1079
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:13,567
Even if it didn't seem like it.

1080
02:03:14,867 --> 02:03:19,166
She'd grasp a thread of a story
from the edge of orgasm and spin it.

1081
02:03:19,833 --> 02:03:21,899
That's how she used to write.

1082
02:03:22,733 --> 02:03:24,299
Not all the time.

1083
02:03:24,467 --> 02:03:29,399
But whenever her career
hit a wall, "that" would strike.

1084
02:03:31,700 --> 02:03:33,032
Those stories

1085
02:03:34,533 --> 02:03:38,232
became a bond that helped
us overcome our child's death.

1086
02:03:43,300 --> 02:03:45,966
I think we were a compatible couple.

1087
02:03:47,167 --> 02:03:49,900
We needed each other to get through life.

1088
02:03:51,167 --> 02:03:54,666
Everyday living and our sex life

1089
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:57,666
were very fulfilling.

1090
02:03:58,633 --> 02:04:00,799
At least they were for me.

1091
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:04,266
But...

1092
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:10,532
Oto saw other men.

1093
02:04:15,817 --> 02:04:17,682
She's fine, don't worry.

1094
02:04:21,283 --> 02:04:23,416
Oto slept with other men.

1095
02:04:25,583 --> 02:04:27,249
Not just one.

1096
02:04:27,617 --> 02:04:31,585
Probably with the actors who
were cast in the dramas she wrote.

1097
02:04:32,783 --> 02:04:35,616
Each relationship ended with the drama,

1098
02:04:35,950 --> 02:04:39,316
and another would begin
when another drama started.

1099
02:04:41,917 --> 02:04:43,782
Do you have evidence?

1100
02:04:44,717 --> 02:04:46,517
I've witnessed them before.

1101
02:04:49,117 --> 02:04:52,149
She sometimes brought them into our home.

1102
02:04:58,217 --> 02:05:01,682
Even so, I've never
doubted her love for me.

1103
02:05:02,917 --> 02:05:04,716
There was no doubt.

1104
02:05:06,550 --> 02:05:10,016
Oto betrayed me so
naturally while she loved me.

1105
02:05:11,450 --> 02:05:14,793
We were definitely deeply
bonded, more so than anyone.

1106
02:05:14,883 --> 02:05:17,016
Still, she contained within her

1107
02:05:17,583 --> 02:05:21,682
a spot that I couldn't look into,
where something dark swirled.

1108
02:05:23,683 --> 02:05:28,499
Didn't you ever ask her about any of this?

1109
02:05:30,667 --> 02:05:34,499
What I feared most was losing her.

1110
02:05:35,533 --> 02:05:40,666
If she found out I knew, we wouldn't
have been able to maintain our balance.

1111
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:47,066
Isn't it possible that she
wanted you to hear her out?

1112
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,132
Did Oto tell you something?

1113
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:04,732
May I tell you a story she told me?

1114
02:06:06,833 --> 02:06:08,132
Yes.

1115
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:10,966
It's a very mysterious tale.

1116
02:06:11,633 --> 02:06:16,432
A high school girl sneaks into
the home of a boy she likes.

1117
02:06:18,967 --> 02:06:22,932
I've heard that one, too.

1118
02:06:23,633 --> 02:06:26,266
The girl who was formerly a lamprey.

1119
02:06:26,467 --> 02:06:27,832
Right.

1120
02:06:28,533 --> 02:06:33,632
She sneaks in multiple times and
leaves a token of herself each time.

1121
02:06:34,533 --> 02:06:38,649
One day, she starts
masturbating on Yamaga's bed.

1122
02:06:39,250 --> 02:06:44,249
Someone comes home, but the
story ends without telling who it was.

1123
02:06:44,617 --> 02:06:46,082
No.

1124
02:06:49,250 --> 02:06:51,049
It doesn't end there.

1125
02:06:54,317 --> 02:06:56,616
You know what happens next?

1126
02:06:57,750 --> 02:06:59,216
Yes.

1127
02:07:00,083 --> 02:07:01,816
Who was it, then?

1128
02:07:03,483 --> 02:07:05,449
Who came up the stairs?

1129
02:07:06,950 --> 02:07:09,082
Another intruder.

1130
02:07:09,650 --> 02:07:11,216
Another one?

1131
02:07:11,650 --> 02:07:13,116
Yes.

1132
02:07:13,450 --> 02:07:17,216
It wasn't Yamaga, or
his father, or his mother.

1133
02:07:17,817 --> 02:07:19,616
Just a burglar.

1134
02:07:20,617 --> 02:07:25,016
The burglar finds her
half naked in the room

1135
02:07:25,417 --> 02:07:27,097
and attempts to rape her.

1136
02:07:28,617 --> 02:07:32,616
She takes a pen lying around
and stabs the man in the left eye.

1137
02:07:33,750 --> 02:07:36,016
She struggles desperately,

1138
02:07:36,417 --> 02:07:41,349
and stabs the pen in his
temple, in his neck, over and over.

1139
02:07:42,717 --> 02:07:45,332
She notices the man has gone limp.

1140
02:07:46,433 --> 02:07:48,932
She has killed the burglar.

1141
02:07:51,367 --> 02:07:56,532
She washes the blood off in
the shower and goes home.

1142
02:07:58,900 --> 02:08:02,632
The token she left in
Yamaga's room that day

1143
02:08:03,467 --> 02:08:05,632
was the burglar's corpse.

1144
02:08:07,567 --> 02:08:12,032
The next morning, she goes
to school prepared to confess

1145
02:08:12,467 --> 02:08:16,066
everything to Yamaga
and face his judgment.

1146
02:08:16,867 --> 02:08:21,899
But Yamaga looks the same
as usual at school that day.

1147
02:08:24,033 --> 02:08:30,132
She sees him play soccer after
school seemingly carefree as always.

1148
02:08:31,367 --> 02:08:33,866
Things are the same the next day.

1149
02:08:35,867 --> 02:08:40,999
Nothing has changed. What became
of that body in Yamaga's house?

1150
02:08:41,967 --> 02:08:45,266
Did she just imagine what happened?

1151
02:08:48,333 --> 02:08:53,666
She goes to Yamaga's house but
nothing seems out of the ordinary.

1152
02:08:54,583 --> 02:08:56,263
Except for one thing...

1153
02:08:57,517 --> 02:09:01,116
A surveillance camera has
been set up by the front door.

1154
02:09:03,817 --> 02:09:09,416
To not appear guilty, she walks
past his house without stopping.

1155
02:09:11,417 --> 02:09:13,550
Something terrible had happened,

1156
02:09:14,483 --> 02:09:17,149
and she was to blame,

1157
02:09:18,283 --> 02:09:21,675
but the world seemed serene
as if nothing had changed.

1158
02:09:23,150 --> 02:09:29,216
However, the world had definitely
changed to something sinister.

1159
02:09:30,883 --> 02:09:33,249
She turns back.

1160
02:09:36,217 --> 02:09:39,225
"I must take responsibility
for what I've done."

1161
02:09:40,350 --> 02:09:43,016
"I can't pretend it didn't happen."

1162
02:09:44,883 --> 02:09:47,083
"Because it definitely happened."

1163
02:09:47,883 --> 02:09:52,049
"I definitely killed that man."

1164
02:09:55,183 --> 02:10:00,982
She searches under the planter
but the key is no longer there.

1165
02:10:02,550 --> 02:10:05,099
She stares at the surveillance camera.

1166
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:09,999
Because it's the only change
she has elicited in this world.

1167
02:10:12,500 --> 02:10:14,599
She looks into the lens and

1168
02:10:16,133 --> 02:10:18,799
repeats her words over and over.

1169
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,799
Clearly, so that she's understood,

1170
02:10:25,533 --> 02:10:27,632
"I killed him."

1171
02:10:29,333 --> 02:10:31,432
"I killed him."

1172
02:10:33,700 --> 02:10:35,799
"I killed him."

1173
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:44,132
This is as far as I know.

1174
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:50,999
Maybe the tale ends
there, or maybe it continues.

1175
02:10:53,533 --> 02:10:55,966
The story leaves a bad taste,

1176
02:10:57,167 --> 02:11:00,132
but even so, when I heard it from her,

1177
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:04,999
I felt that Oto had handed
me something important.

1178
02:11:07,867 --> 02:11:09,332
Mr. Kafuku.

1179
02:11:14,350 --> 02:11:19,482
As far as I know, Oto
was a really lovely woman.

1180
02:11:21,150 --> 02:11:27,149
Of course, what I know must be a
tiny fraction of what you know about her.

1181
02:11:28,050 --> 02:11:30,916
But I still think so with certainty.

1182
02:11:32,250 --> 02:11:35,649
You lived with such a lovely
person for over 20 years,

1183
02:11:37,317 --> 02:11:41,916
and you should be grateful about that.
That's my opinion.

1184
02:11:44,950 --> 02:11:48,282
But even if you think
you know someone well

1185
02:11:49,750 --> 02:11:52,150
even if you love that person deeply,

1186
02:11:54,717 --> 02:11:57,949
you can't completely look
into that person's heart.

1187
02:11:58,317 --> 02:12:00,416
You'll just feel hurt.

1188
02:12:02,350 --> 02:12:05,216
But if you put in enough effort,

1189
02:12:06,050 --> 02:12:09,762
you should be able to look
into your own heart pretty well.

1190
02:12:11,250 --> 02:12:14,282
So in the end, what we should be doing

1191
02:12:16,683 --> 02:12:19,049
is to be true to our hearts

1192
02:12:20,217 --> 02:12:23,399
and come to terms
with it in a capable way.

1193
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:30,033
If you really want to look at someone,

1194
02:12:32,267 --> 02:12:34,499
then your only option is

1195
02:12:37,167 --> 02:12:39,834
to look at yourself squarely and deeply.

1196
02:12:42,833 --> 02:12:44,566
That's what I think.

1197
02:13:48,950 --> 02:13:50,150
You can go now.

1198
02:14:24,850 --> 02:14:27,382
It didn't sound like he was lying.

1199
02:14:34,250 --> 02:14:37,049
I don't know if it's the truth,

1200
02:14:37,917 --> 02:14:41,216
but he was telling you
what was true to him.

1201
02:14:43,767 --> 02:14:45,366
I can tell.

1202
02:14:45,933 --> 02:14:48,666
Because I grew up among liars.

1203
02:14:49,767 --> 02:14:52,567
I had to discern it or I couldn't survive.

1204
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,366
Are you sure?

1205
02:15:10,667 --> 02:15:11,999
Yeah.

1206
02:16:23,450 --> 02:16:26,816
See, there they go again!
Those vulgar geese!

1207
02:16:27,083 --> 02:16:28,716
Acting so boorishly!

1208
02:16:28,950 --> 02:16:30,727
(STOP THAT MAN! HE'S GONE MAD!)

1209
02:16:30,817 --> 02:16:32,527
(STOP THAT MAN! HE'S GONE MAD!)

1210
02:16:32,617 --> 02:16:35,689
(GIVE IT TO ME-!) -Let
me go, Yelena, let me go!

1211
02:16:36,817 --> 02:16:38,449
Where is he?

1212
02:16:39,950 --> 02:16:41,582
Ah, there he is!

1213
02:16:41,850 --> 02:16:42,850
(NO!)

1214
02:16:53,117 --> 02:16:54,716
I didn't get him?

1215
02:16:55,282 --> 02:16:57,249
I missed again?

1216
02:16:57,782 --> 02:16:59,249
Damn it...

1217
02:17:00,117 --> 02:17:02,232
God damn it!

1218
02:17:02,400 --> 02:17:05,066
(GET ME OUT OF HERE!)

1219
02:17:05,333 --> 02:17:07,366
What's wrong with me?

1220
02:17:07,532 --> 02:17:10,732
(KILL ME IF YOU MUST.
I CAN'T STAY HERE ANYMORE!)

1221
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:13,066
What am I doing?

1222
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:31,966
Takatsuki, that was good.

1223
02:17:37,799 --> 02:17:39,479
-Takatsuki...
-Excuse me.

1224
02:17:40,333 --> 02:17:41,532
What.

1225
02:17:43,633 --> 02:17:45,999
I'm Kato, Hiroshima North Police.

1226
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:48,031
Excuse me.

1227
02:17:50,967 --> 02:17:52,932
Koji Takatsuki?

1228
02:17:58,032 --> 02:17:59,032
Yes.

1229
02:17:59,133 --> 02:18:01,466
Could we speak some place else?

1230
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:06,099
Here is fine.

1231
02:18:08,267 --> 02:18:10,316
On Sunday, November 24,

1232
02:18:11,317 --> 02:18:17,482
at around 7:30 p.m., you got into a fight
and beat up a man in Shintenchi Park.

1233
02:18:18,017 --> 02:18:19,649
Is that correct?

1234
02:18:22,282 --> 02:18:24,415
You were caught on camera.

1235
02:18:25,650 --> 02:18:29,149
That man died in the hospital yesterday.

1236
02:18:31,049 --> 02:18:34,882
Yes, I saw the news.

1237
02:18:36,549 --> 02:18:40,316
I did it. That's correct.

1238
02:18:41,883 --> 02:18:44,449
Come with us to the police station.

1239
02:18:44,617 --> 02:18:46,716
-May I change?
-Yes.

1240
02:19:47,700 --> 02:19:52,399
"Hiroshima North Police."

1241
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:10,749
The lawyer

1242
02:20:11,167 --> 02:20:15,866
says that Mr. Takatsuki admits to
the charge of injury resulting in death.

1243
02:20:20,767 --> 02:20:22,299
Can I see him?

1244
02:20:22,667 --> 02:20:24,466
Not now.

1245
02:20:25,433 --> 02:20:29,149
More importantly, what
shall we do about the play?

1246
02:20:31,483 --> 02:20:33,449
Must we think about that now?

1247
02:20:33,617 --> 02:20:38,116
Yes. It's something we must think about.

1248
02:20:39,083 --> 02:20:41,849
We have two choices.

1249
02:20:43,483 --> 02:20:45,049
We cancel it,

1250
02:20:45,550 --> 02:20:48,082
or you act in it.

1251
02:20:53,250 --> 02:20:54,882
I can't do that.

1252
02:20:56,383 --> 02:20:59,116
You know all the lines.

1253
02:20:59,783 --> 02:21:04,249
Vanya in Japanese like Takatsuki
would be the least disruptive.

1254
02:21:04,750 --> 02:21:06,049
Yoon-su.

1255
02:21:07,450 --> 02:21:09,616
Why are we discussing this now?

1256
02:21:15,150 --> 02:21:16,916
I can't do it.

1257
02:21:18,817 --> 02:21:22,216
Then let's cancel.

1258
02:21:23,250 --> 02:21:25,049
Is that all right?

1259
02:21:37,517 --> 02:21:39,232
Give me some time.

1260
02:21:40,067 --> 02:21:44,099
We can wait 2 days. That's the limit.

1261
02:21:45,233 --> 02:21:46,699
I understand.

1262
02:21:47,567 --> 02:21:49,247
I'll get back to you.

1263
02:22:07,067 --> 02:22:09,732
Do you know of a place where

1264
02:22:11,833 --> 02:22:13,353
can think in peace?

1265
02:22:25,667 --> 02:22:27,366
I'll drive you somewhere.

1266
02:22:42,667 --> 02:22:44,499
Kami-junitaki Village.

1267
02:22:49,517 --> 02:22:51,449
Are you willing to show me

1268
02:22:52,783 --> 02:22:54,650
the place where you grew up?

1269
02:22:57,517 --> 02:22:59,449
There's nothing there.

1270
02:23:02,917 --> 02:23:04,597
If that's OK with you.

1271
02:23:05,950 --> 02:23:07,282
I don't mind.

1272
02:24:05,933 --> 02:24:07,933
I'll take the wheel somewhere.

1273
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:12,699
We should take turns
to get there in a day.

1274
02:24:14,333 --> 02:24:15,966
No taking turns.

1275
02:24:18,733 --> 02:24:19,899
Why not?

1276
02:24:20,067 --> 02:24:22,832
Because driving is my job.

1277
02:24:26,333 --> 02:24:29,499
I can go without sleeping for a day.

1278
02:25:57,117 --> 02:25:58,416
Thank you.

1279
02:25:58,617 --> 02:26:00,549
You can rest a bit more.

1280
02:26:00,917 --> 02:26:02,597
I can sleep in the ferry.

1281
02:26:02,917 --> 02:26:04,116
I see.

1282
02:27:01,367 --> 02:27:02,899
The day Oto died...

1283
02:27:07,167 --> 02:27:10,751
She asked before I left if we
could talk when I got home.

1284
02:27:12,600 --> 02:27:15,166
Her tone was gentle but determined.

1285
02:27:16,800 --> 02:27:20,599
I had no plans that
day, but kept on driving.

1286
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:23,520
I couldn't go home.

1287
02:27:24,333 --> 02:27:29,582
I thought that once I went home,
we would never be the same again.

1288
02:27:31,617 --> 02:27:34,881
I found her collapsed
when I returned late at night.

1289
02:27:37,317 --> 02:27:38,997
I called an ambulance,

1290
02:27:43,083 --> 02:27:45,550
but she never regained consciousness.

1291
02:27:48,117 --> 02:27:50,517
What if I'd gone home a bit earlier?

1292
02:27:52,083 --> 02:27:53,982
I think so every day.

1293
02:28:01,750 --> 02:28:03,482
I killed my mother.

1294
02:28:06,150 --> 02:28:08,582
When the landslide crushed our home,

1295
02:28:09,750 --> 02:28:11,616
I was inside, too.

1296
02:28:12,383 --> 02:28:16,416
I was able to crawl out
from the fallen house.

1297
02:28:18,517 --> 02:28:22,549
After escaping, I gazed at the
half-collapsed house for a while.

1298
02:28:23,950 --> 02:28:28,749
Then some more debris came
falling and completely destroyed it.

1299
02:28:31,350 --> 02:28:34,382
My mother was found dead under the debris.

1300
02:28:36,833 --> 02:28:40,032
I knew she was still in the house.

1301
02:28:41,667 --> 02:28:47,566
I don't know why I didn't call
for help, or why I didn't save her.

1302
02:28:48,567 --> 02:28:52,699
I hated her, but that wasn't
the only thing I felt about her.

1303
02:28:57,233 --> 02:29:01,099
This scar on my cheek
is from that accident.

1304
02:29:02,433 --> 02:29:05,599
I was told surgery could
make it less conspicuous,

1305
02:29:06,500 --> 02:29:09,499
but I don't feel like erasing it.

1306
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:20,132
If I were your father,

1307
02:29:22,433 --> 02:29:25,166
I'd hold you round the shoulders and say,

1308
02:29:27,567 --> 02:29:29,247
"It's not your fault."

1309
02:29:31,100 --> 02:29:33,132
"You did nothing wrong."

1310
02:29:39,433 --> 02:29:41,113
But I can't say that.

1311
02:29:45,067 --> 02:29:46,982
You killed your mother,

1312
02:29:48,783 --> 02:29:50,549
and I killed my wife.

1313
02:29:54,483 --> 02:29:55,649
Yes.

1314
02:31:06,933 --> 02:31:10,032
Altercation with Kazuya
Yamauchi of Hiroshima

1315
02:31:10,233 --> 02:31:13,689
and assaulted him, repeatedly
punching him in the face.

1316
02:31:14,200 --> 02:31:18,732
Yamauchi was taken to hospital
but was pronounced dead.

1317
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:25,699
Koji Takatsuki is an actor who has
appeared in many dramas and movies,

1318
02:31:26,067 --> 02:31:30,699
but after reports of his relationship
with a minor broke last year,

1319
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:36,366
he worked independently, quitting
his management company in january.

1320
02:32:05,783 --> 02:32:07,149
Good morning.

1321
02:32:55,083 --> 02:32:59,749
"Flowers & Vegetables For Sale."

1322
02:34:35,450 --> 02:34:37,849
Is this where you...

1323
02:34:38,417 --> 02:34:39,982
Probably.

1324
02:34:43,417 --> 02:34:45,282
It's changed a lot.

1325
02:34:48,417 --> 02:34:50,097
Could we go up there?

1326
02:35:44,467 --> 02:35:45,999
That's our house.

1327
02:36:20,967 --> 02:36:22,199
My mother

1328
02:36:23,733 --> 02:36:26,333
had a separate personality named Sachi.

1329
02:36:31,433 --> 02:36:32,699
Yes.

1330
02:36:33,667 --> 02:36:36,432
She first appeared when I was 14.

1331
02:36:37,800 --> 02:36:39,766
She said she was 8 years old,

1332
02:36:39,933 --> 02:36:43,282
but she never aged in 4 years.

1333
02:36:48,283 --> 02:36:49,749
Sachi would

1334
02:36:50,483 --> 02:36:54,516
often appear after my
mother beat me up terribly.

1335
02:36:57,650 --> 02:37:02,249
It was like her awareness
didn't match the body of an adult,

1336
02:37:03,117 --> 02:37:04,949
so she couldn't move well.

1337
02:37:06,750 --> 02:37:09,049
She'd try to walk but fall over,

1338
02:37:10,150 --> 02:37:13,216
and would end up just sitting still.

1339
02:37:18,917 --> 02:37:21,316
Sachi liked puzzle rings.

1340
02:37:23,617 --> 02:37:26,316
We did crosswords together.

1341
02:37:28,583 --> 02:37:31,549
Sachi cried a lot for no reason.

1342
02:37:33,417 --> 02:37:35,449
Whenever she did, I'd hold her

1343
02:37:36,183 --> 02:37:38,250
and rub her back over and over.

1344
02:37:40,417 --> 02:37:44,616
I liked those times.

1345
02:38:05,233 --> 02:38:08,066
The last beautiful thing in my mother

1346
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:11,666
was condensed in Sachi.

1347
02:38:14,333 --> 02:38:16,032
Sachi was

1348
02:38:18,467 --> 02:38:20,666
my only friend.

1349
02:38:49,833 --> 02:38:52,966
I don't know if my
mother was mentally ill,

1350
02:38:54,967 --> 02:38:59,966
or if she was acting to
keep me close to her.

1351
02:39:03,450 --> 02:39:06,816
But even if she were acting,

1352
02:39:08,517 --> 02:39:11,249
it was from the bottom of her heart.

1353
02:39:14,850 --> 02:39:17,316
Becoming Sachi was my mother's way

1354
02:39:18,950 --> 02:39:22,416
of surviving in a
hellish reality, I think.

1355
02:39:33,550 --> 02:39:35,549
When that landslide occurred,

1356
02:39:37,783 --> 02:39:39,916
I knew that my mother's death

1357
02:39:41,117 --> 02:39:44,216
meant that Sachi would die, too.

1358
02:39:46,883 --> 02:39:48,149
Even so.

1359
02:39:51,350 --> 02:39:53,349
I didn't move.

1360
02:40:12,500 --> 02:40:13,932
It's dirty.

1361
02:40:27,967 --> 02:40:29,266
Mr. Kafuku,

1362
02:40:30,167 --> 02:40:31,732
about Oto...

1363
02:40:34,400 --> 02:40:37,832
Would it be hard for you to accept her,

1364
02:40:38,600 --> 02:40:41,566
everything about her, as genuine?

1365
02:40:44,333 --> 02:40:47,233
Maybe there was nothing
mysterious about her.

1366
02:40:48,500 --> 02:40:52,099
Would it be hard to think
that she was simply like that?

1367
02:40:54,467 --> 02:40:56,932
That she loved you dearly and

1368
02:40:58,133 --> 02:41:00,899
that she sought other men constantly

1369
02:41:02,767 --> 02:41:07,132
don't seem to contradict each
other or sound deceptive to me.

1370
02:41:09,967 --> 02:41:11,732
Is that strange?

1371
02:41:19,333 --> 02:41:20,632
I'm sorry.

1372
02:41:36,883 --> 02:41:39,083
I should have been hurt properly.

1373
02:41:41,783 --> 02:41:43,949
I let something genuine slip by.

1374
02:41:46,317 --> 02:41:48,482
I was so deeply hurt.

1375
02:41:49,883 --> 02:41:51,750
To the point of distraction.

1376
02:41:53,883 --> 02:41:55,316
But...

1377
02:41:56,550 --> 02:41:57,982
Because of that.

1378
02:41:59,550 --> 02:42:01,816
I pretended not to notice it.

1379
02:42:04,483 --> 02:42:06,816
I didn't listen to myself.

1380
02:42:14,550 --> 02:42:16,816
So I lost Oto.

1381
02:42:19,550 --> 02:42:21,016
Forever.

1382
02:42:24,050 --> 02:42:25,582
Now I see.

1383
02:42:34,367 --> 02:42:36,032
I want to see Oto.

1384
02:42:39,500 --> 02:42:41,567
If I do, I want to yell at her.

1385
02:42:43,100 --> 02:42:44,599
Berate her.

1386
02:42:45,733 --> 02:42:47,999
For lying to me all the time.

1387
02:42:49,800 --> 02:42:51,400
I want to apologize.

1388
02:42:54,067 --> 02:42:56,366
For not listening.

1389
02:42:58,833 --> 02:43:00,999
For not being strong.

1390
02:43:07,400 --> 02:43:08,866
I want her back.

1391
02:43:10,867 --> 02:43:12,387
I want her to live.

1392
02:43:14,400 --> 02:43:16,867
I want to talk to her just once more.

1393
02:43:22,833 --> 02:43:24,466
I want to see her.

1394
02:43:28,133 --> 02:43:29,699
But it's too late.

1395
02:43:33,133 --> 02:43:34,832
There's no turning back.

1396
02:43:36,667 --> 02:43:38,347
There's nothing I can do.

1397
02:44:04,717 --> 02:44:06,382
Those who survive

1398
02:44:07,383 --> 02:44:09,749
keep thinking about the dead.

1399
02:44:11,483 --> 02:44:13,163
In one way or another,

1400
02:44:15,383 --> 02:44:16,982
that will continue.

1401
02:44:23,083 --> 02:44:24,566
You and I

1402
02:44:25,883 --> 02:44:27,949
must keep living like that.

1403
02:44:39,650 --> 02:44:41,330
We must keep on living.

1404
02:44:55,433 --> 02:44:56,666
It'll be OK.

1405
02:45:01,333 --> 02:45:02,899
I'm sure

1406
02:45:06,033 --> 02:45:07,399
we'll be OK.

1407
02:45:49,733 --> 02:45:52,866
I refuse! Wait, I'm not done yet!

1408
02:45:53,833 --> 02:45:57,732
You destroyed my life. I've never lived.

1409
02:45:57,900 --> 02:46:02,682
Because of you, I wasted the best
years of my life and spoiled them.

1410
02:46:03,017 --> 02:46:05,316
You're my foe. My bitter enemy!

1411
02:46:05,483 --> 02:46:06,843
I can't stand it.

1412
02:46:07,117 --> 02:46:08,760
(BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT?)

1413
02:46:08,850 --> 02:46:10,182
I'm going.

1414
02:46:10,383 --> 02:46:14,216
(WHAT EARTHLY RIGHT HAVE YOU
TO USE SUCH LANGUAGE TO ME?)

1415
02:46:14,383 --> 02:46:15,716
(YOU FOOL!)

1416
02:46:16,717 --> 02:46:20,716
(IF THIS ESTATE IS YOURS,
THEN TAKE IT, I DON'T CARE!)

1417
02:46:21,117 --> 02:46:25,149
(THIS IS LIKE HELL.
I CAN'T STAND IT. I'M LEAVING NOW.)

1418
02:46:25,350 --> 02:46:28,482
I'm gifted and intelligent.
Courageous, too.

1419
02:46:28,817 --> 02:46:32,893
If I'd lived normally, I might have been
another Schopenhauer or Dostoevsky.

1420
02:46:32,983 --> 02:46:34,716
I'm sick of this nonsense!

1421
02:46:35,450 --> 02:46:36,793
I'm losing my mind!

1422
02:46:36,883 --> 02:46:39,682
Mother, I can't take it anymore!

1423
02:46:39,983 --> 02:46:42,516
Listen to the professor!

1424
02:46:42,683 --> 02:46:45,549
Mother, what should I do?

1425
02:46:46,183 --> 02:46:51,049
No, never mind. Don't say anything.
I know what to do.

1426
02:46:51,383 --> 02:46:53,616
I'll make you pay for this!

1427
02:46:53,817 --> 02:46:55,216
Jean!

1428
02:48:21,083 --> 02:48:22,916
I'm miserable.

1429
02:48:27,117 --> 02:48:29,882
If you only knew how miserable I am.

1430
02:48:34,417 --> 02:48:36,816
What can we do?

1431
02:48:37,317 --> 02:48:40,382
We must live our lives.

1432
02:49:08,583 --> 02:49:11,849
Yes, we shall live, Uncle Vanya.

1433
02:49:18,017 --> 02:49:20,782
We'll live through the long, long days,

1434
02:49:21,650 --> 02:49:26,116
and through the long nights.

1435
02:49:28,267 --> 02:49:35,099
We'll patiently endure the
trials that fate sends our way.

1436
02:49:35,767 --> 02:49:40,266
Even if we can't rest,

1437
02:49:41,233 --> 02:49:47,199
we'll continue to work for others

1438
02:49:50,367 --> 02:49:54,299
both now and when we have grown old.

1439
02:49:57,700 --> 02:50:00,899
And when our last hour comes

1440
02:50:01,200 --> 02:50:05,632
we'll go quietly.

1441
02:50:11,300 --> 02:50:15,566
And in the great beyond, we'll say to Him

1442
02:50:22,567 --> 02:50:27,032
that we suffered

1443
02:50:30,533 --> 02:50:34,199
that we cried

1444
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:39,416
that life was hard.

1445
02:50:42,117 --> 02:50:44,616
And God

1446
02:50:46,917 --> 02:50:50,182
will have pity on us.

1447
02:51:00,983 --> 02:51:04,282
Then you and I

1448
02:51:05,183 --> 02:51:08,516
we4l see that bright, wonderful,

1449
02:51:11,383 --> 02:51:15,216
dreamlike life before our eyes.

1450
02:51:18,650 --> 02:51:21,782
We shall rejoice, and

1451
02:51:23,383 --> 02:51:27,482
with tender smiles on our faces,

1452
02:51:28,883 --> 02:51:32,482
we'll look back on our current sorrow.

1453
02:51:38,183 --> 02:51:40,549
And then at last

1454
02:51:40,983 --> 02:51:43,682
we shall rest.

1455
02:51:48,767 --> 02:51:51,532
I believe it.

1456
02:51:53,633 --> 02:51:57,032
I strongly believe it from
the bottom of my heart.

1457
02:51:58,200 --> 02:52:01,432
When that time comes,

1458
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:10,832
we shall rest.

1459
02:53:35,150 --> 02:53:36,849
(NEED A PLASTIC BAG?)

1460
02:53:37,050 --> 02:53:38,949
(NO, I'M FINE.)

1461
02:53:42,050 --> 02:53:43,360
(SAVING YOUR POINTS?)

1462
02:53:43,450 --> 02:53:44,616
(NO.)
