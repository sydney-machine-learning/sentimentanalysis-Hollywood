00:00:11,317 --> 00:00:13,907
<i>Oh, my God,
you're, like, coughing.</i>

3
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:15,579
- <i>I actually like it.</i>
- <i>Yeah, I like it.</i>

4
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:17,884
<i>This is an
announcement about Picture Day.</i>

5
00:00:17,926 --> 00:00:20,085
<i>Freshmen class portraits
at 9:30.</i>

6
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:22,448
<i>Sophomore class portraits
at 10:30.</i>

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,527
<i>Juniors will be during lunch.</i>

8
00:00:25,798 --> 00:00:27,187
That wasn't hard.

9
00:00:27,229 --> 00:00:28,395
Shut up, bitch.

10
00:00:28,437 --> 00:00:29,794
You shut up.

11
00:00:29,836 --> 00:00:30,896
Feel like a man.

12
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:32,228
Like a giant.

13
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,734
Cherry bomb!

14
00:00:55,287 --> 00:00:56,295
Comb?

15
00:00:57,456 --> 00:01:00,398
Mirror? Comb? No?

16
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:03,764
Mirror?

17
00:01:04,901 --> 00:01:05,863
Comb?

18
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:07,534
- Bonzai!
- Oh!

19
00:01:07,576 --> 00:01:09,242
Fuck off, asshole.

20
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:12,245
- Ugh!
- I'll take it.

21
00:01:22,152 --> 00:01:23,487
So what's your name?

22
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,787
Talkative. I like that.

23
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,087
How's your day going?

24
00:01:30,597 --> 00:01:31,624
Yeah.

25
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:32,925
Dinner tonight?

26
00:01:34,263 --> 00:01:36,330
Are you asking me out?

27
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:37,592
Yes.

28
00:01:37,634 --> 00:01:39,592
I'm not going on a date
with you. You're 12.

29
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:41,601
You're funny. I'm 15.

30
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,034
How old are you?

31
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,469
You're not supposed
to ask that.

32
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:47,935
You're not supposed to ask
a girl how old she is.

33
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:49,470
Annoying.

34
00:01:49,512 --> 00:01:51,944
You're right,
it doesn't matter to me.

35
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,907
How are you
gonna pay for dinner?

36
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,816
If I say yes and we go
on a date for dinner,

37
00:01:57,858 --> 00:01:58,985
how are you gonna pay?

38
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:01,682
You say everything twice.

39
00:02:01,724 --> 00:02:03,419
- I don't say everything twice.
- You do. You do.

40
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:05,430
What is this,
"Say everything twice"?

41
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,532
Come on. How are you gonna pay?

42
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:11,963
Do you go to the movies?

43
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:13,965
Of course I go to the movies.

44
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:15,737
Did you see <i>Under One Roof?</i>

45
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:17,376
Yeah.

46
00:02:18,175 --> 00:02:20,371
You're looking at Tony.

47
00:02:20,413 --> 00:02:21,939
There's, like,
a million kids in that movie.

48
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:24,210
I don't know a Tony.

49
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:26,174
I want you to have dinner
with me, not my work.

50
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:27,345
I'm not trying to brag,

51
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:29,347
but you did ask how I was
gonna pay for dinner.

52
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:33,644
You're such an actor.
You're such an actor.

53
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,152
What else have you been in?

54
00:02:35,194 --> 00:02:36,814
- <i>This House is Haunted.</i>
- No.

55
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,390
- <i>Two Beds, Two Baths.</i>
- Mmm-mmm.

56
00:02:39,432 --> 00:02:41,355
I've done three sketches
on <i>The Merv Griffin Show.</i>

57
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:42,493
Did you ever see me on the...

58
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:44,330
All right. Don't list your
whole resume, it's braggy.

59
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,159
I'm not going on a date
with you, man. You're 15.

60
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,198
"Man."

61
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,706
I like that.

62
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:53,537
"Kid," how about that?

63
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:56,669
I'm not going on a date
with you, "kid." You're 15.

64
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:59,570
Don't call it a date.
It's not a date.

65
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:01,044
Just come say hello.

66
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:02,345
I like the way you look.

67
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:04,376
I like talking with you.

68
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:05,708
Where do you live?

69
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,878
Encino.

70
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,853
Encino? I live in Encino.
Where in Encino?

71
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:10,914
On Hatteras.

72
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:13,016
- Hatteras and what?
- Ugh. Creep.

73
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,822
"Hatteras and what?
Hatteras and what?"

74
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:16,322
I'm not telling you where
I live, creep. Come on.

75
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:18,493
- I'll be at the Tail o' the Cock tonight.
- I don't care where you'll be.

76
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:19,696
I go there every Thursday
for dinner.

77
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:21,201
I don't care where you eat.
Wait, where are your parents

78
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,562
- while all this is happening?
- They're working.

79
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:25,037
They're working.
Just come say hi.

80
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,973
Just shut up.

81
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:29,771
I'll tell you
what I'm doing.

82
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:32,878
I take my brother Greg
to Tastee-Freez around 6:30,

83
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,340
he's in bed by 7:30.

84
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:36,739
Wait, you go all the way from Encino
to Tail o' the Cock for dinner?

85
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:37,947
I live in Sherman Oaks.

86
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:39,110
Oh, come on.

87
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,579
I take my brother Greg
to Tastee-Freez around 6:30,

88
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,918
he's in bed by 7:30.

89
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,088
I slip around the corner to
Tail o' the Cock for my dinner.

90
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,685
That's where I'll be.

91
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:47,761
I'm not trying to pressure you.

92
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:49,226
You are pressuring me.

93
00:03:49,268 --> 00:03:50,392
You are.
That's what you're doing.

94
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:51,592
If you wanna come
and say hello,

95
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:52,856
if it's convenient
within your plans,

96
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:54,263
I'd love to see you.

97
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:56,293
"Convenient within my plans"?

98
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:58,533
Wait, you leave your brother alone?
How old is he?

99
00:03:58,575 --> 00:04:00,974
He's eight. He's nine.

100
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:03,474
You're hilarious.

101
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:05,940
You can't even keep
your own stories straight.

102
00:04:05,982 --> 00:04:08,071
What are you? You're like a little...

103
00:04:08,113 --> 00:04:10,776
Robert Goulet,
Dean Martin or something.

104
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:12,785
- Where do you come from?
- Sherman Oaks.

105
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:14,526
Ha! Sherman Oaks.

106
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:17,421
- Hi, Alana.
- Hi, Cindy.

107
00:04:17,463 --> 00:04:19,792
Did you know we got
a big movie star here?

108
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:21,652
Gary Valentine.

109
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,469
Your name is Valentine?

110
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:25,461
Valentine.

111
00:04:25,503 --> 00:04:26,623
Should I get
an autograph?

112
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:28,034
Don't bother.

113
00:04:29,177 --> 00:04:30,337
I've been right here
the whole time.

114
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,564
I get this feeling I was meant
to know you, Alana.

115
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:34,770
You know I'm 25, right?

116
00:04:34,812 --> 00:04:36,974
I can be your friend
but I can't be your girlfriend.

117
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:38,076
That's illegal.

118
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:40,003
- You give me hope.
- Shut up.

119
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:41,345
This is fate
that brought us together.

120
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:42,945
- This is fate.
- Shut up.

121
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:44,116
Card.

122
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:47,450
- Right here. Okay.
- I mean, I'm trying

123
00:04:47,492 --> 00:04:48,649
- to spend my time with you.
- Oi, oi.

124
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:49,988
- Is that bad?
- Stop, stop that. Oi.

125
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,048
Turn your legs around.

126
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,819
Not too down,
so look up, look up. Uh...

127
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,523
Close your mouth
just a little bit.

128
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:56,625
Just see a little bit of teeth.

129
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:57,691
Little bit of teeth.
Little bit of teeth.

130
00:04:57,733 --> 00:05:00,194
Go on, like a tiger.
Off it. Go.

131
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:01,996
Next. Next.

132
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:04,533
How have I never seen you before?
How have we never met?

133
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:06,832
Stop talking
so much, slimy.

134
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:10,435
We'll see.
I doubt it, but we'll see.

135
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,041
Now I gotta get back to work and
you have to get back to class.

136
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:15,678
Stop using time as an excuse, Alana.
Our roads took us here.

137
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,217
Stop sounding
like a philosophy guy,

138
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:20,151
Albert Einstein.
Maybe I'll see you later.

139
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:22,187
I'm not gonna see you later.

140
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:29,621
Put your chin up
just a little bit like that, Laura.

141
00:05:31,037 --> 00:05:32,032
Chin up, chin up.

142
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:38,874
- Hey, Gary. Hey, Greg.
- Hey.

143
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,409
I met the girl
I'm gonna marry one day, Greg.

144
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,624
Oh, yeah?

145
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:55,286
And you're gonna be
my best man.

146
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:16,241
<i>So,
two down and Garvey the batter.</i>

147
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,045
I'll be at the Tail
o' the Cock if you need me.

148
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:22,244
Love you, Greggo.

149
00:06:22,286 --> 00:06:23,380
Love you, too.

150
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:30,182
<i>Steve finished the
regular season with 111 RBIs,</i>

151
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:33,923
<i>three more than Jimmy Wynn.</i>

152
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:36,890
<i>Sixth inning with the Dodgers
leading two to nothing.</i>

153
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:39,399
<i>Two runs, three hits,
and no errors.</i>

154
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,265
<i>Remember, there are
still tickets available</i>

155
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:43,695
<i>for Tuesday's game.</i>

156
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,932
<i>You can get them today</i>

157
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:47,765
<i>at the Dodgers ticket office
on Stadium Way.</i>

158
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,112
<i>And the pitch is high,
ball one.</i>

159
00:06:57,454 --> 00:06:59,086
Don't be creepy, please.

160
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,431
<i>Foul ball
up the middle.</i>

161
00:07:13,473 --> 00:07:15,465
Will you stop
with the googly eyes?

162
00:07:20,212 --> 00:07:21,713
Excuse me, Don.

163
00:07:22,314 --> 00:07:23,604
Can I have two Cokes?

164
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:25,075
Sure, Gary, you got it.

165
00:07:25,117 --> 00:07:26,113
Thank you.

166
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,563
Stop.

167
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,354
What?

168
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:39,995
I can hear you breathing.

169
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,032
Stop.

170
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:47,673
- Breathing?
- Yes.

171
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:05,592
So, Alana, what are your plans?

172
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:11,014
I don't know.

173
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:12,830
What's your future look like?

174
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,054
I don't know.

175
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:16,834
How do you like working
at Tiny Toes?

176
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:19,860
I hate working at Tiny Toes.

177
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:21,165
You should start
your own business.

178
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:25,403
What business should I be in?

179
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:27,006
I don't know.
What do you like?

180
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,639
I don't know.

181
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:31,635
You're an actress.
You should be an actress.

182
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:38,050
So how'd you become
such a hotshot actor?

183
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:39,515
I'm a showman.

184
00:08:39,557 --> 00:08:40,881
- It's my calling.
- Ugh.

185
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:42,078
I don't know how
to do anything else.

186
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,346
It's what I'm meant to do.

187
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:44,752
I mean, ever since
I was a kid, I've been

188
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:46,555
- a song and dance man.
- Come on.

189
00:08:46,597 --> 00:08:48,360
Ever since you were a kid?

190
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,558
Song and dance man?

191
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,191
Where are your parents?

192
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,762
- My mom works for me.
- Oh, of course she does.

193
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:54,861
- Yes, she does.
- That makes sense.

194
00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:55,929
In my public relations company.

195
00:08:55,971 --> 00:08:58,601
In your
public relations company?

196
00:08:58,643 --> 00:09:00,097
- Because you have that?
- Yes.

197
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,834
- And you're an actor.
- Yes.

198
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:03,206
And you're a secret agent too?

199
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,069
Well, no,
I'm not a secret agent.

200
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:07,412
That's funny.

201
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,317
Are you joking?

202
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,584
Well, no, I'm not.

203
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,253
That's a lot.

204
00:09:16,295 --> 00:09:17,714
Gets complicated.

205
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:19,452
I'm sure.

206
00:09:19,494 --> 00:09:21,591
And all that math homework you
have to do after everything.

207
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,793
My mom's in Las Vegas right now

208
00:09:24,835 --> 00:09:26,793
taking care of
the Hacienda Hotel,

209
00:09:26,835 --> 00:09:28,568
which leaves me back here.

210
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,366
We do PR for Tail o'
the Cock and Chadney's.

211
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:31,435
I like Chadney's.

212
00:09:31,477 --> 00:09:32,634
- You like Chadney's?
- Yeah.

213
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:34,473
Do you like Japanese food?

214
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:36,206
I don't really know
what that is.

215
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:38,038
The Mikado?

216
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,045
I'm taking you to The Mikado
next time.

217
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:41,246
Next time?

218
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:42,788
Yeah.

219
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,252
The food's magnificent.

220
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,125
You're sweet, Gary.

221
00:09:55,298 --> 00:09:59,101
You're gonna be rich in a
mansion by the time you're 16.

222
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,162
I'm gonna be here

223
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:04,810
taking photos of kids for
their yearbooks when I'm 30.

224
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,011
You're never gonna remember me.

225
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:11,146
I'm not gonna forget you.

226
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,380
Just like you're not
gonna forget me.

227
00:10:33,501 --> 00:10:36,601
If I ask for your phone number,
would you give it to me?

228
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:39,362
Why should I give you
my phone number?

229
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:41,308
So I can call you.

230
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,801
I don't know, Gary.

231
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:45,851
Why not?

232
00:10:46,915 --> 00:10:48,544
How are you gonna remember it?

233
00:10:48,586 --> 00:10:50,317
It's only seven numbers.

234
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:58,315
758-4686.

235
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:01,097
- 756-4686.
- You already got it wrong.

236
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:04,661
758-4686.

237
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:07,334
All right, Don Rickles.

238
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:13,631
Don't call me
all the time. Okay?

239
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,541
We're not boyfriend and girlfriend.
Remember that.

240
00:11:18,747 --> 00:11:20,380
We're... You know.

241
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:22,888
I know.

242
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,892
- Hi, Dad.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

243
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:41,397
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

244
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,734
What's up?

245
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:44,305
- What?
- What's going on?

246
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:46,702
Nothing.

247
00:11:46,744 --> 00:11:48,064
What time is it now?

248
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:49,112
10:00.

249
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,701
What'd you do?

250
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:53,442
I told you what I was
gonna do this morning.

251
00:11:53,484 --> 00:11:54,546
What?

252
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,712
Go to dinner with Lisa.

253
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:56,844
- Lisa?
- Yeah.

254
00:11:56,886 --> 00:11:58,274
Who the fuck is Lisa?

255
00:11:58,316 --> 00:11:59,910
Dad, you know Lisa.

256
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,014
Lisa?

257
00:12:01,056 --> 00:12:02,182
Yeah, she works with me

258
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:03,245
- at Tiny Toes.
- I don't know Lisa.

259
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:04,930
- What?
- Yes.

260
00:12:18,477 --> 00:12:19,938
Where were you?

261
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,639
Why are you dressed like that?
Were you on a date?

262
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:23,940
Looks like it was a long date.

263
00:12:23,982 --> 00:12:25,704
Get out of my room, Este.

264
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,650
<i>"His name is
Jerome H. Frick.</i>

265
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:33,917
His friends know him
simply as Jerry,

266
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,752
and his attractive
young wife as Mioko.

267
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:38,318
Their new restaurant Mikado

268
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,318
is a delightful dinery
featuring foods of Japan,

269
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,961
and it should be
quite authentic,

270
00:12:43,003 --> 00:12:46,463
for Jerry had a restaurant
some 15 years in Tokyo.

271
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:47,733
The entire staff,

272
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:50,427
with the exception of Jerry,
is Japanese,

273
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,771
and those 'little doll'
waitresses

274
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:55,604
are dressed fittingly
in colorful kimonos.

275
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:56,805
Give it a try,

276
00:12:56,847 --> 00:12:59,275
we think you'll be delighted."

277
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:02,578
- Oh, that's wonderful, Anita.
- Oh, fantastic.

278
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,649
Oh, of course.

279
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:05,409
- It's just wonderful.
- Oh.

280
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,684
- Thank you.
- Of course.

281
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:08,413
Uh, do you think
we should mention

282
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,952
something about
the serenity, though?

283
00:13:09,994 --> 00:13:12,651
- Hmm.
- The pleasant quiet?

284
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:15,420
Yes, and I wish that we had
space to include everything

285
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,990
because it's such
a beautiful restaurant,

286
00:13:17,032 --> 00:13:19,367
but if we choose one thing...

287
00:13:20,573 --> 00:13:21,763
Right.

288
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:24,197
Okay. Let's just...

289
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:26,768
Oh, Mioko,

290
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,532
how you think of this?

291
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,511
What do you think of item
for newspaper?

292
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,261
Oh, oh, Yoko-san.

293
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:48,384
I think the cuisine
is not mentioned.

294
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:49,495
- Oh.
- She's wondering

295
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,891
if we mentioned the cuisine.

296
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:52,457
Of co... Uh...

297
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,492
- The cuisine?
- Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

298
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,532
I think we did talk about that,
didn't we?

299
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:57,462
I might...

300
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,572
I have an earlier draft.

301
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:02,636
Here it is.

302
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:05,976
"There is a complete roster of
Japanese appetizers available

303
00:14:06,018 --> 00:14:08,978
while sipping American
or Japanese spirits.

304
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,181
For the daring,
sashimi is offered.

305
00:14:11,223 --> 00:14:14,085
But don't worry, there are
many American dishes too.

306
00:14:14,127 --> 00:14:18,749
Mikado is for the gourmet
and the non-gourmet alike."

307
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,690
What you think of that?

308
00:14:25,137 --> 00:14:27,490
Much better
talking about the cuisine

309
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:28,724
than the waitresses. Thank you.

310
00:14:28,766 --> 00:14:31,102
Oh, fantastic.
I will make a note of that.

311
00:14:31,144 --> 00:14:34,267
- Sure.
- That's what we'll send to the paper.

312
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:35,740
Thank you so much

313
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:37,235
for coming in to

00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:38,711
Really appreciate it, Anita.

315
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,009
- Thank you so much.
- Mmm-hmm.

I can't take you to New York

No. Why is that bad?

Well, you can't go to New York

330

They're not gonna let you do the

How's the chicken?

00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,390
Delicious.

Excuse me, sir,
could I offer you another beverage?

00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:47,437
I beg your pardon?

00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:35,287
- Pretty smooth ride, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

353
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:36,663
Never flown this bird before.

354
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:40,290
What'd you have for lunch?

355
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,566
Salisbury steak.

356
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:43,463
I had the chicken.

357
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:45,936
They did have steak back here?
Good, good.

358
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,676
All right. Well, hey,
very nice to meet you, Alana.

359
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,349
I'll see you on the tarmac.

360
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,010
Charmed.

361
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:03,087
Wow, super-hot chaperone, Gar.
Nice one.

362
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:04,748
That's my friend,
don't think about that.

363
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,585
Oh, man, are you kidding?
My mind's racing,

364
00:17:06,627 --> 00:17:08,252
doing circles around
that track.

365
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:12,489
Hello, boys.

366
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,666

373
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:28,873
And, Valentine, don't.
Just don't in here.

374
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:31,778
What's that? What is that? V?
Is that for "vagina"?

375
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,114
Why are you doing that?
Why do people keep doing that?

376
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:35,281
Peace and love, baby.

377
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:36,583
Oh, shut it, you little shit.

378
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:38,922
Now, cut the comedy.
Don't be an ass out there.

379
00:17:38,964 --> 00:17:41,127
Good show, everybody.

380
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:42,927
- Thank you, Lucy.
- Thank you, Lucy.

381
00:17:44,172 --> 00:17:47,527
Sweetheart, do not embarrass
Mommy, okay? Have fun.

382
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:49,571
Break legs.

383
00:17:52,003 --> 00:17:53,871
Watch for me on stage.
I'll send you a signal.

384
00:17:53,913 --> 00:17:55,038
I'll make a joke just for you.

385
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,875
- Okay.
- Straight ahead.

386
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:58,308
She's not
even stopping.

387
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,318
Keep going straight ahead
to the stage.

388
00:18:01,688 --> 00:18:03,072
To the right.

389
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:12,322
Lucy, I wanna tell you how much
we enjoyed your visit tonight.

390
00:18:12,364 --> 00:18:14,892
Before you go,
I'd like the audience to meet

391
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:16,627

392
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:17,722

Lance, how's things
in Hollywood for you?

432

Oh, things are going
real well, Jerry.

433
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:06,370
I just did a guest spot on <i>Banacek</i>
with George Peppard for NBC.

434
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:08,007
George Peppard.
That's great, that's great.

435
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:09,371
- Thank you.
- How about you, Gary?

436
00:20:09,413 --> 00:20:11,667
Well, last week
I did Three Beavers.

437
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:12,978
<i>Leave it to Beaver?</i>

438
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:15,208
Three Beavers.

439
00:20:17,652 --> 00:20:18,710
Hi, what's your name?

440
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:20,119
Thank you
for asking, Jerry.

441
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:21,380
- Boo.
- My name is Margo.

442
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:22,513
Hi, Margo.

443
00:20:24,562 --> 00:20:26,290
- Oh, there you are, my...
- You little shit!

444
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:27,953
- You little prick.
- What'd I do?

445
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:31,024
You think you're funny, huh?
You think you're funny?

446
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:33,296
- Humiliating me in front of millions.
- Lucy! Wait.

447
00:20:33,338 --> 00:20:35,197
- Let me go.
- These are my fans.

448
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:37,027
You cannot treat me like this.

449
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,939
This is the end for you.
I'm coming to get you.

450
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:42,473
Oh, baby, are you okay?

451
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:44,041
- She didn't seem too happy.
- Are you okay?

452
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,273
- No.
- It's okay.

453
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:46,375
Is she like that all the time?

454
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:48,208
More or less, yeah.

455
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,421
How are you doing?

456
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:52,416
- Good.
- Good.

457
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,710
All right, I should go
get out of these pajamas.

458
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:56,049
- Okay.
- I'll see you.

459
00:20:56,091 --> 00:20:57,088
Bye.

460
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:26,349

young man.

462
00:21:28,057 --> 00:21:29,054
Gary?

463
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:30,683
- Gary Valentine.
- Vic.

464
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:31,781
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

465
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,353
What've you been up to, man?

466
00:21:33,395 --> 00:21:35,688
I was in New York on a PR trip for
<i>Under One Roof. The Jerry Best Show.</i>

467
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,755
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my God, you're huge.

468
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,295
- Oh, hi, Gale.
- Wow.

00:21:39,337 --> 00:21:40,824
- Gary.
- Nice to see you.

470
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:41,966
You've really grown a lot, huh?

471
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:43,135
- Yeah.
- Good,

472
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,476
you've been eating
your vegetables.

473
00:21:45,978 --> 00:21:48,033
And action.

474
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:50,680
You can wear the new
Sears 10-in-1 suit this way.

475
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:57,313
Or this way.

476
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:22,138
Or try this all-new
vest suit look.

477
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,570
Or seven other ways.

478
00:22:23,612 --> 00:22:25,067
Perfect, man, you still got it.

479
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:27,036

00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:38,417
How about a, uh, cold read?

486
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:40,059
Sure, let's do it.

487
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:43,719
And action.

488
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:44,925
"My face is a..."

489
00:22:44,967 --> 00:22:46,262
Sorry.
Can I do it one more time?

490
00:22:46,304 --> 00:22:48,067
- Sure.
- "My fa..."

491
00:22:49,775 --> 00:22:52,762
"My face is a pimply mess
and I don't know what to do."

492
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,264
Cut. Fantabulous!

493
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:56,867
- You still got it, man.
- Thank you. Thanks, Vic.

494
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,004

00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:12,347
<i>Or make sure they all have
their own sleeping bags?</i>

523
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:13,619
"Make sure they all have

524
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,112
- their own sleeping bags."
- <i>Your 13-year-old daughter</i>

525
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:17,419
<i>wants to have a co-ed
slumber party.</i>

526
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:19,756
<i>What should Mom do, Mike?</i>

527
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:22,424
<i>No question in my mind.
Tell Henrietta no.</i>

528
00:24:22,466 --> 00:24:24,924
<i>Provide separate rooms, uh-uh.</i>

529
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:26,422
<i>Tell Henrietta no.
That's, that's...</i>

530
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,929
<i>Mike would say,
"Henrietta, no." Sheri?</i>

531
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:30,634
<i>I would love
to sleep with the kids,</i>

532
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:33,137
<i>but I think as long as
she's only 13, I agree.</i>

533
00:24:35,143 --> 00:24:38,542
<i>We agree. I would tell her no.
No, no slumber parties.</i>

534
00:24:38,584 --> 00:24:41,613
<i>All right,
Sheri agrees with Mike.</i>

535
00:24:41,655 --> 00:24:43,547
<i>It's a good thing</i>

536
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:44,950
<i>that you agreed with me
on that one.</i>

537
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:53,665
Hello?

538
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:57,328
Hello?

539
00:24:58,171 --> 00:24:59,998
<i>Is Alana there?</i>

540
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,398
Yeah. Who's this?

541
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,532
<i>Lance.</i>

542
00:25:05,574 --> 00:25:06,876
Yeah, hold on one second.

543
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:09,400
Alana, it's Lance.

544
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:11,501
<i>I believe that you
should provide separate rooms.</i>

545
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:14,752
<i>I don't think you should
call the party off, or...</i>

546
00:25:17,418 --> 00:25:18,591
Hello?

547
00:25:19,354 --> 00:25:20,417
Lance?

548
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:24,754
Hello?

549
00:25:24,796 --> 00:25:26,487
<i>Well,
they might try something.</i>

550
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:27,560
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

551
00:25:27,602 --> 00:25:28,693
<i>If you're gonna be there
to stop them...</i>

552
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,319
<i>If you're a good parent,
and you're watching...</i>

553
00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:32,396
<i>I can hear
someone breathing.</i>

554
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:34,325
<i>All right, Chuck,</i>

555
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,225
<i>that's not exactly agreeing
with them, but...</i>

556
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:38,170
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>Chuck says,</i>

557
00:25:38,212 --> 00:25:39,833
<i>"Provide separate rooms."</i>

558
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:41,100
<i>Marina, do you agree
with Chuck?</i>

559
00:25:41,142 --> 00:25:42,571
<i>No, this is
where we start again.</i>

560
00:25:42,613 --> 00:25:44,441
<i>We always disagree.</i>

561
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:47,072
<i>I'm going to tell</i>

562
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:48,406
<i>Henrietta no.
I think she's too young.</i>

563
00:25:48,448 --> 00:25:52,117
<i>And I wouldn't even let her
have a girl sleeping...</i>

564
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,754
The phone's ringing.

565
00:25:55,796 --> 00:25:57,514
<i>I don't agree with him.
I agree with him.</i>

566
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,929
<i>I don't care if she knows...</i>

567
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:02,461
<i>So Marina says,</i>

568
00:26:02,503 --> 00:26:05,731
<i>"No. No co-ed slumber
party." Louis?</i>

569
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,696
<i>Well, I think
I'd provide separate rooms.</i>

570
00:26:08,738 --> 00:26:10,128
<i>No, you just can't.</i>

571
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,633
<i>You tell Henrietta no.
She's too young.</i>

572
00:26:28,095 --> 00:26:29,282
<i>Max?</i>

573
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:31,386
- <i>Yes, ma'am?</i>
- <i>Is there someone there?</i>

574
00:26:31,428 --> 00:26:32,522
<i>Yes, madam.</i>

575
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:37,958
<i>Okay, Louis.
Provide separate rooms.</i>

576
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,756
<i>Louis says provide
separate rooms. Tracy?</i>

577
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:43,333
<i>I'd tell Henrietta no
because she's too young.</i>

578
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:54,073
<i>Mike and Sheri
were the only couple</i>

579
00:26:54,115 --> 00:26:56,409
<i>who agrees with
telling Henrietta no.</i>

580
00:26:56,451 --> 00:26:59,285
<i>Not one of you had said,
suggested sleeping with the kids.</i>

581
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:13,068
<i>♪ Amen ♪</i>

582
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,136
Nice.

583
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:18,139
Lance...

584
00:27:19,742 --> 00:27:22,044
are you ready for nice dinner?

585
00:27:22,645 --> 00:27:24,001
- Very ready.
- Good.

586
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:25,245
Thank you for having me again.

587
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:26,884
Wonderful.

588
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,140
Are you ready to do a <i>berakhah</i>
on the <i>challah?</i>

589
00:27:32,182 --> 00:27:33,885
Oh, wow, thank you. Uh,

590
00:27:33,927 --> 00:27:36,685
however, I must respectfully refuse.
I'm an atheist.

591
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:48,268
You're Jewish.

592
00:27:49,332 --> 00:27:51,335
Well, you're certainly right.

593
00:27:51,377 --> 00:27:53,165
I was born into Judaism,

594
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:56,972
but my personal path
has led me to atheism.

595
00:27:57,014 --> 00:27:58,500
You see, I just can't believe
there's a God

596
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:00,409
when I see all the suffering in
the world.

597
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:02,337
Vietnam, you know?

598
00:28:02,379 --> 00:28:05,077
So, with all due respect,
no, sir.

599
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,287
I can't do the blessing,
but thank you.

600
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,866
What does your penis look like?

601
00:28:16,731 --> 00:28:17,935
What?

602
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,203
What does your penis look like?

603
00:28:24,543 --> 00:28:27,241
Like a regular penis, I guess.

604
00:28:28,413 --> 00:28:29,980
Is it circumcised?

605
00:28:31,414 --> 00:28:32,477
Yeah.

606
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,711
Then you're a fucking Jew!

607
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:40,717
Why would you do that?
Why would you do that?

608
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,254
He was maybe gonna be
my boyfriend.

609
00:28:42,296 --> 00:28:43,349
Listen, young lady,

610
00:28:43,391 --> 00:28:45,283
you don't bring this idiot
to Shabbat dinner here.

611
00:28:45,325 --> 00:28:47,559
Listen, Dad,
he's an atheist, and an actor,

612
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,088
- and he's famous.
- But he's Jewish.

613
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,286
He was gonna take me
out of here.

614
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,891
Este, don't you
even look at me.

615
00:28:51,933 --> 00:28:52,960
Don't you even look at me.

616
00:28:53,002 --> 00:28:54,195
- You're always looking at me.
- No.

617
00:28:54,237 --> 00:28:55,867
- I didn't even say anything.
- What are you doing?

618
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:57,593
What are you doing?
What are you thinking, huh?

619
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:00,371
"I'm Este. I work for Mom and Dad.
I'm perfect.

620
00:29:00,413 --> 00:29:01,430
I'm a real estate agent.

621
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:02,764
Alana doesn't have
her life together.

622
00:29:02,806 --> 00:29:05,740
Alana brings home stupid
boyfriends all the time."

623
00:29:05,782 --> 00:29:07,239
- I mean...
- I knew it.

624
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:08,746
I knew that was
what you were thinking.

625
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,415
You're always thinking things,
you thinker.

626
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,649
You thinker! You think things!

627
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:22,789
Gotta stop fighting with
everyone all the time.

628
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:24,463
Oh, fuck off, Danielle.

629
00:29:54,196 --> 00:29:56,921
Hello, baby.
How can I help you?

630
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:59,027
What is that?

631
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:02,072
That is a bed
made of water, sweetheart.

632
00:30:02,507 --> 00:30:03,876
What's your name?

633
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:05,669
Gary.

634
00:30:06,146 --> 00:30:07,209
Gary,

635
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:11,210
won't you come in
and take a closer look at it.

636
00:30:11,252 --> 00:30:12,885
It won't bite.

637
00:30:22,593 --> 00:30:23,995
Come on, baby.

638
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:37,910
It's nice, isn't it?

639
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:42,442
Hop on.

640
00:30:49,422 --> 00:30:51,253
Groove on that.

641
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,324
How much does it cost?

642
00:30:59,366 --> 00:31:02,327
$69.95.

643
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:03,823
Do you dig it?

644
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:05,489
Do you love it?

645
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:08,928
Nobody's gonna sleep
on mattresses anymore.

646
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,732
That's old hat, Jack.

647
00:31:10,774 --> 00:31:12,406
That's for squares.

648
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,364
Do you sell
a lot of these?

649
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:18,104
No, you're my first customer.

650
00:31:18,146 --> 00:31:19,874
How long
has it been out?

651
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:21,841
Just a couple of days.

652
00:31:21,883 --> 00:31:23,914
It's modern edge.

653
00:31:23,956 --> 00:31:28,585
Out-there, sleep and dream technology.

654
00:31:28,627 --> 00:31:30,886
Liquid luxury for you.

655
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:34,263

your lady friend.

- the real Herman Munster?
- Can I have your autograph?

681
00:32:29,387 --> 00:32:31,574
No, we're not open.
Yes, I'm the real Herman Munster,

but you can't be here

Okay.

688
00:32:45,638 --> 00:32:47,294
Um, I have my dad's pipe.

689
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:49,666
So, we should give
your customers some weed

690
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:51,198
to help sell waterbeds.

691
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,366
Yeah, that is actually
a good idea.

692
00:32:53,408 --> 00:32:54,606
Do you mind grabbing lights

693
00:32:54,648 --> 00:32:56,081
- Yeah, okay.
- Thank you.

00:33:09,825 --> 00:33:11,722
Photo booth.

699
00:33:11,764 --> 00:33:13,887
Okay. Let's sell some beds.

There's my star.
There's my star.

701

702
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:19,357
Magical. Magical.

703
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:21,865
Head right here,
facing that way.

704
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:27,364
Lovely. Lovely. Look that way.
Look that way.

705
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:29,739
Arm like this. Arm like this.

706
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:31,729
Who wants to be famous?

707
00:33:31,815 --> 00:33:33,049
Who wants to be famous?

708
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,507
- Hey, Gary. Gary. Hey.
- Just guess the amount of...

709
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:36,906
I think I know where
I can find some LSD.

710
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,411
Do you think that would be
better than the weed?

711
00:33:38,453 --> 00:33:40,074
No, no, no. Keep it
with the grass, man.

712
00:33:40,116 --> 00:33:41,685
- Keep it with the grass.
- All right. Okay, sounds good.

713
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:42,754
Keep it with the grass.

714
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,480
Have you guys
ever been to the ocean?

715
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:46,819
- Yeah, why?
- Sure.

716
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:50,025
You remember that relaxing feeling
of just laying on the water?

717
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:51,393
- Laying on the water?
- Yeah.

718
00:33:51,435 --> 00:33:53,798
Have that every night
with a Soggy Bottom waterbed.

719
00:33:55,037 --> 00:33:56,597
Keep the energy up, Kiki.

Hello, handsome.

729
00:34:20,094 --> 00:34:21,089
Come here often?

730
00:34:22,131 --> 00:34:25,755
No, 'cause I'm not a teenager.

731
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,997
I'm selling earrings
for my friend JoJo.

732
00:34:30,506 --> 00:34:33,277
Is your bottom soggy?
Having trouble sleeping?

733
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,412
Well, now that
you mention it...

734
00:34:38,585 --> 00:34:40,571

No boyfriend.

738
00:34:45,155 --> 00:34:47,115
So I don't really have trouble.

739
00:34:50,762 --> 00:34:51,757
Well, that's good.

740
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,755
Let me introduce you

741
00:34:54,797 --> 00:34:57,395
to the greatest invention in
sleeping since the inner spring.

00:34:57,437 --> 00:35:01,232
<i>And don't forget,
we have the movies of Tarzana.</i>

I've seen these before.
These are far out.

744
00:35:05,502 --> 00:35:06,597
Oh, hi, Kiki.

745
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,732
Hey, Alana.
What are you doing here?

746
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:11,104
Seeing this
little David Cassidy.

747
00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:12,171
What are you doing here?

748
00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:13,548
I'm working for him.

749
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:15,649
Is that so?

750
00:35:16,888 --> 00:35:18,678
So, how many dots is it?

751
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,751
Who knows? I don't think
they even counted.

752
00:35:20,793 --> 00:35:22,179
- Hey!
- Whoa!

753
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:23,418
Whoa. Whoa.

754
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,856
- Gary.
- Hey! What's going on?

755
00:35:24,898 --> 00:35:26,182
- Gary!
- Gary!

756
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,232
Officers?

757
00:35:28,033 --> 00:35:29,354
- What's going...
- Gary!

758
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:30,520
What? Officer, what...

759
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:31,688
No, Gary! No! No! Gary!

760
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,921
There must
be a mistake.

761
00:35:32,963 --> 00:35:34,363
- Gary!
- Gary, what did you do?

762
00:35:34,405 --> 00:35:36,660
- Officer, what did I do?
- Officers, he's innocent,

763
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:37,761
- he's a kid.
- I promise I'm innocent.

764
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,534
- He has rights!
- Officer, what did I do?

765
00:35:39,576 --> 00:35:41,271
- What are your badge numbers?
- Officer, what did I do?

766
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:42,472
- I will be reporting you...
- What did I do?

767
00:35:42,514 --> 00:35:44,645
...to the chief of police
immediately when I get outside.

768
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:46,416
Where's he going?

769
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:48,375
Gary, don't worry.

770
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:49,779
Don't worry.
I'm gonna find you, okay?

771
00:35:49,821 --> 00:35:50,915
Don't worry, okay?

772

Hey, that's him?

789
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:13,960
That's not him.

790

Come on.

791
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:00,385
Come on.

792
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:04,279
Come on!

793
00:38:42,556 --> 00:38:43,593
What did you do?

794
00:38:45,493 --> 00:38:47,784
Did you murder someone, huh?

795
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,401
What, do you have drugs on you?

796
00:38:50,101 --> 00:38:51,601
What did you do, Gary?

797
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:30,265
<i>Do you still have

798
00:39:30,307 --> 00:39:31,929
No, no...

799
00:39:31,971 --> 00:39:34,105
No, I threw it out.
I threw it out.

800
00:39:39,278 --> 00:39:42,817
Hey, "Soggy Bottom" sounds
like someone shit their pants.

801
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:48,019
I know, I know.

802
00:39:48,061 --> 00:39:49,989
- That's not good.
- I know.

803
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,454
That's only funny to you guys.

804
00:39:52,496 --> 00:39:53,789
But when someone wants
to buy a bed,

805
00:39:53,831 --> 00:39:56,124
they don't wanna think about
shitting or shitty diapers,

806
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:58,087
or shit in pants.

807
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,590
Well, the bed's not just
for sleeping, Alana.

808
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:03,963
Well, if it's not just for sleeping,
I think you mean it's for sex.

809
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:06,465
"Soggy Bottom" isn't making
anyone hot or horny.

810
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:07,842
It doesn't make you hot?

811
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:09,305
No.

812
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:16,038
<i>"Everybody's talking about

814
00:40:17,522 --> 00:40:18,815

Twenty, 25, 30. Just 30.

I got 400. 400.

853
00:42:45,801 --> 00:42:47,857
- 150.
- I have 400,

854
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,465

855
00:42:49,507 --> 00:42:50,726
Wait a sec. What were the five?

856
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:51,798
Fifty here.

All right.

858
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:54,633
- 30.
- There's 21.

859
00:42:54,675 --> 00:42:55,735
Twenty-one's there.

860
00:42:55,777 --> 00:42:56,839
And then
how much was the change?

861
00:42:56,881 --> 00:42:58,642
Wait, I think there
might have been 19 there.

862
00:42:58,684 --> 00:43:00,311
Not that good of a start.

863
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:02,136
No, we have 21.

864
00:43:02,178 --> 00:43:03,413
No, we only had 19.

865
00:43:06,686 --> 00:43:09,023
"Fat Bernie's..."

866
00:43:09,855 --> 00:43:11,980
It's small on the bottom.

867
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,830
Too many "Fat Bernie's."

868
00:43:14,864 --> 00:43:17,493
Yeah, but it can be small.
That's fine.

869
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,200
And then...

870
00:43:22,536 --> 00:43:23,708
Let's try...

871
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:29,404
<i>To radiate the specimen
with your ionization nebulizer.</i>

872
00:43:29,446 --> 00:43:30,834
<i>Now, back to the ship.</i>

873
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:31,947
Are you left-handed?

874
00:43:33,781 --> 00:43:35,979
Yeah. You didn't know that?

875
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:37,075
No.

876
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:39,383
I've never met anyone
left-handed before.

877
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,056
Really?

878
00:43:48,561 --> 00:43:49,625
Gary!

879
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:50,691
- There he is.
- Jerry.

880
00:43:50,733 --> 00:43:52,157
Good to see you. How you doing?

881
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,495
- Good to see you, my friend.
- Good to see you.

882
00:43:53,537 --> 00:43:54,595
- All right.
- Hi, Mioko.

883
00:43:54,637 --> 00:43:55,863
No, no, no. Mioko is gone.

884
00:43:55,905 --> 00:43:58,601
This is my new wife,
Kimiko.

885
00:43:58,643 --> 00:44:00,371
- Hi, Kimiko.
- Pretty as a picture.

886
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:02,539
Who's this pretty thing?

887
00:44:02,581 --> 00:44:04,542
Uh, this is
my lady friend, Alana.

888
00:44:04,584 --> 00:44:06,439
- How do you do, Alana?
- Business partner.

889
00:44:06,481 --> 00:44:07,540
A pleasure.

890
00:44:07,582 --> 00:44:08,643
Nice to meet you.

891
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:11,877
Jerry, I want to talk
to you about this,

892
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:13,044
- by the way.
- Hold up, hold up.

893
00:44:13,086 --> 00:44:15,212
Let's do it right.
Let's sit down

894
00:44:15,254 --> 00:44:17,552
and have something
to drink first, okay?

895
00:44:17,594 --> 00:44:18,653
- Sounds great.
- After you.

896
00:44:18,695 --> 00:44:20,226
Thank you, Jerry.

897
00:44:23,266 --> 00:44:27,997
Oh, Gary, I love you,
and I wanna do anything for you.

898
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:30,959
But I just don't really think
these fit in my restaurant.

899
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,066
We're Japanese,

900
00:44:32,108 --> 00:44:36,067
and this waterbed business
is strictly American.

901
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:37,408
Uh, Kimiko,

902
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,784
what you think
of this waterbed?

903
00:44:44,784 --> 00:44:45,922
Mmm-hmm.

904
00:44:46,688 --> 00:44:48,542
What did she just say?

905
00:44:48,584 --> 00:44:51,046
It's hard to tell,
I don't speak Japanese.

906
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,318
Gary, I wanna help,

907
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,031
but can I help without putting
these out inside everywhere?

908
00:45:05,134 --> 00:45:06,701
Oh, hey, Alana.

909
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:09,143
Hey, Frisbee.

910
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:11,938
You work here?

911
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:14,643
Unfortunately.
What are you doing?

912
00:45:15,722 --> 00:45:18,338
Helping my friend
with his waterbed business.

913
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,075
- Gary?
- Yeah. You know him?

914
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,551
Yeah, I love that kid.

915
00:45:22,823 --> 00:45:24,323
- You love him?
- Uh-huh.

916
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:26,087
How do you know him?

917
00:45:26,129 --> 00:45:28,586
He's in here all the time.
He's a friend of Jerry's.

918
00:45:28,628 --> 00:45:29,856
Yeah.

919
00:45:29,898 --> 00:45:31,396
He's cute for a little hustler.

920
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:36,299
He's also really smart
and a good businessman.

921
00:45:36,341 --> 00:45:38,096
Mmm-hmm.

922
00:45:38,138 --> 00:45:39,976
Hey, you still work
at Tiny Toes?

923
00:45:40,942 --> 00:45:43,144
No, I'm partners with Gary now.

924
00:45:43,844 --> 00:45:46,345
Oh, the "Hand Man."

925
00:45:48,248 --> 00:45:50,080
Did he try and get
a hand job from you?

926
00:45:51,524 --> 00:45:53,882
Yeah, he's asking all the time.

927
00:45:53,924 --> 00:45:56,322
Good. I'll pass
the baton off to you.

928
00:46:01,194 --> 00:46:03,154
Okay, I'll see you
later, Frisbee.

929
00:46:03,196 --> 00:46:05,992
Okay. Say hi
to your sisters for me.

930
00:46:16,712 --> 00:46:22,005
I could describe the sensation
as a soft, spongy, slow-motion trampoline

931
00:46:22,047 --> 00:46:23,146
without the great bounce.

932
00:46:23,188 --> 00:46:24,513
Sexier.

933
00:46:24,555 --> 00:46:25,682
Sexier. Make it sexier.

934
00:46:25,724 --> 00:46:26,782
<i>But there's no...</i>

935
00:46:26,824 --> 00:46:27,849
- Shut up.
- <i>I can't...</i>

936
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:30,014
<i>There's no floor model
for me to try?</i>

937
00:46:30,056 --> 00:46:31,484
No, but you can get the bed

938
00:46:31,526 --> 00:46:33,347
and if you don't like it,
we can do a money-back guarantee.

939
00:46:33,389 --> 00:46:34,749
Alana, you have to be sexier

940
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,260
- or he's not gonna buy it.
- <i>I think I just wanna</i>

941
00:46:36,302 --> 00:46:37,089
<i>think about it for a while,
then maybe I'll give you a call back.</i>

942
00:46:37,131 --> 00:46:38,328
Don't let him
get off the phone.

943
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,592
What's your name?

944
00:46:39,634 --> 00:46:40,795
<i>Uh, Ted.</i>

945
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:42,693
Ted.

946
00:46:42,735 --> 00:46:43,863
<i>Yes.</i>

947
00:46:43,905 --> 00:46:46,370
Oh, Ted, I love that name.

948
00:46:46,412 --> 00:46:47,406
<i>Okay...</i>

949
00:46:47,907 --> 00:46:48,997
My name's Alana.

950
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:50,531
<i>Hi, Alana.</i>

951
00:46:50,573 --> 00:46:52,604
Can I come and install
the bed for you?

952
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:53,777
<i>What?</i>

953
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:56,879
I'd lay it down
and show you how it works.

954
00:46:56,921 --> 00:46:59,088
It moves in a similar way
to the ocean...

955
00:47:00,391 --> 00:47:03,044
wet inside.

956
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:07,386
And it takes some getting used to,
but once you're in there, oh, Ted,

957
00:47:07,428 --> 00:47:10,389
I don't think you're
gonna be asking any questions.

958
00:47:10,431 --> 00:47:12,358
<i>Sounds like you just sold
a waterbed, Alana.</i>

959
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,465
<i>Tell me, what time can you
be over with that bed?</i>

960
00:47:14,507 --> 00:47:17,129
Oh, well. Eager.

961
00:47:17,171 --> 00:47:19,401
I have to wait until
my work is done.

962
00:47:19,443 --> 00:47:20,631
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

963
00:47:20,673 --> 00:47:25,135
Yeah. I have a mean, old boss
that makes me work all day.

964
00:47:25,177 --> 00:47:28,040
<i>Why don't you tell Fat Bernie you
have work to do and get out of there?</i>

965
00:47:28,082 --> 00:47:31,073
Oh. Fat Bernie is so mean, Ted.

966
00:47:31,115 --> 00:47:32,175
<i>Sounds like it.</i>

967
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:34,453
He keeps me locked up inside.

968
00:47:35,758 --> 00:47:36,881
But you know what, Ted?

969
00:47:36,923 --> 00:47:37,985
<i>What's that?</i>

970
00:47:38,027 --> 00:47:42,750
I know you're
gonna love our wet beds.

971
00:47:42,792 --> 00:47:44,559
- You know what they come with?
- <i>What's that?</i>

972
00:47:44,601 --> 00:47:46,263
A wood headboard.

973
00:47:46,305 --> 00:47:50,929
And that wood is strong and sticks
straight up against the wall.

974
00:47:50,971 --> 00:47:52,030
<i>That sounds great.</i>

975
00:47:52,072 --> 00:47:53,894
We don't have wood headboards.

976
00:47:53,936 --> 00:47:56,071
I'm gonna hand you off
to my associate, Kirk,

977
00:47:56,113 --> 00:47:58,105
and he's gonna take down
all your information,

978
00:47:58,147 --> 00:48:00,341
and I will be
at your place later, Ted.

979
00:48:00,383 --> 00:48:03,077
Thank you for calling Fat Bernie's.
Have a nice day.

980
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,844
What are you doing?
We don't have beds.

981
00:48:04,886 --> 00:48:05,950
Well, we better get some,

982
00:48:05,992 --> 00:48:08,276
because water in a plastic bag
is a water balloon.

983
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:09,412
With a frame, it's a bed.

984
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:11,015
Let's just go
to Northridge Lumber,

985
00:48:11,057 --> 00:48:12,690
- they have real good...
- I wrote good dialogue. You're improvising too much.

986
00:48:12,732 --> 00:48:14,057
You told me
to make it more sexy.

987
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,026
I told you to make it
more sexy, I didn't tell you,

988
00:48:16,068 --> 00:48:17,752
"Go over to the guy's house
and get in his bed."

989
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:20,688
I told you I'm a good actress,
Gary. I told you.

990
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:22,296
Don't tell me to make it
more sexy, man.

991
00:48:22,338 --> 00:48:25,936
If you want it more sexy,
I'll make it fucking horny.

992
00:48:25,978 --> 00:48:30,474
We just have our own
dreams and ideas.

993
00:48:30,516 --> 00:48:31,702
And so we'll just...

994
00:48:31,744 --> 00:48:35,111
So, just say yes.
To whatever she asks you, just say yes.

995
00:48:35,153 --> 00:48:37,440
Let's say, if she asks you
if you can sing, say yes.

996
00:48:37,482 --> 00:48:39,143
If she asks if you can dance,
say yes.

997
00:48:39,185 --> 00:48:40,375
I can sing, and I can dance.

998
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,984
No, I know. I know. I know.

999
00:48:43,026 --> 00:48:44,979
I'm just saying that
if she asks you

1000
00:48:45,021 --> 00:48:47,325
if you can do something that
you might not know how to do,

1001
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:48,453
just say yes.

1002
00:48:48,495 --> 00:48:49,988
Because you can always
learn how to do something

1003
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,365
once you get the part.

1004
00:48:53,037 --> 00:48:55,623
So just say yes
to whatever she asks.

1005
00:48:55,665 --> 00:48:57,330
Whatever she asks,
just say yes.

1006
00:48:57,372 --> 00:48:58,731
- Just say yes, just say yes...
- Okay, I got it.

1007
00:48:58,773 --> 00:48:59,769
Okay.

1008
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:02,112
- Hi, Janice.
- Hi, Gary.

1009
00:49:03,175 --> 00:49:05,049
- Mary.
- Oh, darling.

1010
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:12,114
So, Gary tells me
that you've been studying

1011
00:49:12,156 --> 00:49:14,274
at Everywoman's Village
with Milton Farmer.

1012
00:49:14,316 --> 00:49:15,610
Yes.

1013
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,686
I love his work
with young actors.

1014
00:49:17,728 --> 00:49:20,116
He is a miracle worker.

1015
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:27,203
You have a warm smile,

1016
00:49:28,233 --> 00:49:31,471
which is very powerful.

1017
00:49:33,241 --> 00:49:36,509
And you have
a very Jewish nose,

1018
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:40,701
which is becoming
very fashionable.

1019
00:49:40,743 --> 00:49:43,040
I am getting
a lot more requests

1020
00:49:43,082 --> 00:49:44,253
for Jewish girls.

1021
00:49:45,053 --> 00:49:46,648
Really? That's great.

1022
00:49:53,926 --> 00:49:54,923
No.

1023
00:50:00,273 --> 00:50:01,369
No.

1024
00:50:09,711 --> 00:50:11,214
No.

1025
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,121
Love to Tatum.

1026
00:50:18,755 --> 00:50:20,212
Are you athletic?

1027
00:50:20,254 --> 00:50:21,879
You seem to have
a very firm body.

1028
00:50:21,921 --> 00:50:22,985
Yes.

1029
00:50:23,027 --> 00:50:25,355
Do you know
how to horseback ride?

1030
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,923
Yes.

1031
00:50:26,965 --> 00:50:28,957
Uh, do you know
how to do fencing?

1032
00:50:29,392 --> 00:50:30,464
Yes, I can fence.

1033
00:50:32,297 --> 00:50:34,059
- Basketball?
- Yes.

1034
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:35,389
- Baseball?
- Yes.

1035
00:50:35,431 --> 00:50:36,932
- Soccer?
- Yes.

1036
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,938
Any other sports or special
skills that I should know about?

1037
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,281
I studied Krav Maga.

1038
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:50,774
Well, I don't know what that is.
What is "Quick Draw McGraw"?

1039
00:50:50,816 --> 00:50:53,942
It's martial arts from Israel.
It's used in combat.

1040
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:56,622
My dad was in the Israeli Army.
We all know it.

1041
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:03,921
So it's a form of karate,
let's say?

1042
00:51:03,963 --> 00:51:06,632
It's more like, "How to use a
pen to stab someone's eye out."

1043
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:13,001
You're a goddamn
fucking fighter, aren't you?

1044
00:51:13,435 --> 00:51:14,607
I like that.

1045
00:51:16,175 --> 00:51:17,511
I can see that.

1046
00:51:18,843 --> 00:51:23,142
You come here
trying to be all pretty for me,

1047
00:51:23,184 --> 00:51:25,354
but really, you remind me...

1048
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,820
of a dog.

1049
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:33,824
Of an English pit bull dog...

1050
00:51:35,326 --> 00:51:37,366
with sex appeal...

1051
00:51:37,997 --> 00:51:39,632
and...

1052
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:43,666
a very Jewish nose.

1053
00:51:47,144 --> 00:51:49,001
Do you know
any other languages?

1054
00:51:49,043 --> 00:51:50,346
Besides English?

1055
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,733
Hebrew.

1056
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:55,172
- Besides Hebrew.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

1057
00:51:55,214 --> 00:51:56,715
Um... Spanish...

1058
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,321
Oh.

1059
00:51:58,985 --> 00:52:00,177
French...

1060
00:52:00,219 --> 00:52:01,225
Mmm-hmm.

1061
00:52:03,055 --> 00:52:04,327
Latin...

1062
00:52:07,831 --> 00:52:08,958
And Portuguese.

1063
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:13,798
<i>Bueno.</i>

1064
00:52:16,742 --> 00:52:18,165
<i>Fantastico.</i>

1065
00:52:22,842 --> 00:52:24,474
Would you
be willing to work topless?

1066
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,513
Yes.

1067
00:52:26,848 --> 00:52:27,845
No.

1068
00:52:31,413 --> 00:52:35,754
You will lose out on work if
you're not willing to do nudity.

1069
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:40,217
So you'd be naked in a movie,
but you wouldn't make out with me?

1070
00:52:40,259 --> 00:52:42,885
You'd show the whole world your
boobs, but I'm not allowed to see?

1071
00:52:42,927 --> 00:52:44,159
You told me to say yes
to everything, remember?

1072
00:52:44,201 --> 00:52:45,325
I told you to say no
to that, Alana.

1073
00:52:45,367 --> 00:52:46,892
Well, I didn't know
what to say.

1074
00:52:46,934 --> 00:52:48,096
Say "no!"

1075
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:52,631
I would get naked in a movie
if it gave me the part.

1076
00:52:52,673 --> 00:52:54,398
Actresses get naked in movies
all the time.

1077
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,631
What's wrong with that, Gary?

1078
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:56,799
Because there's too much nudity

1079
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:58,406
- in pictures right now.
- Oh, come on.

1080
00:52:58,448 --> 00:53:00,811
And you're my friend.
We're friends, Alana.

1081
00:53:00,853 --> 00:53:02,205
And you'd do it in a movie,

1082
00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:04,677
you'd show your boobs in a movie
but you wouldn't show them to me!

1083
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:07,476
Why won't you ask someone
your age to see their boobs?

1084
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:08,622
Because I'm asking you!

1085
00:53:43,656 --> 00:53:45,214
Do you really wanna
see my boobs?

1086
00:53:45,256 --> 00:53:46,330
Yes.

1087
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:50,994
- Where's Greg?
- He's in his room.

1088
00:54:10,184 --> 00:54:11,454
Can I touch them?

1089
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:14,523
No.

1090
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:19,594
If you ever say anything to anyone,
I'm never speaking to you ever again.

1091
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:22,289
I'll see you tomorrow.

1092
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:37,271
Do you think it's weird I hang out
with Gary and his friends all the time?

1093
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,388
No.

1094
00:54:48,894 --> 00:54:50,152
I think it's weird.

1095
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:58,963
It is whatever you think it is.

1096
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:04,697
I think it's weird
that I hang out with Gary

1097
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:06,905
and his 15-year-old friends all
the time.

1098

1099

1100
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:26,451
Yes, I'm happy. Are you happy?

1101
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:27,957
If you're happy, I'm happy.

1102
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,793
Of course, I'm happy!

00:55:31,593 --> 00:55:32,667
Really?

1105
00:55:33,773 --> 00:55:35,098
Wow.

1106
00:55:42,345 --> 00:55:44,138
<i>The best kind of vinyl.</i>

1107
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,799

1108
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:46,901

1109
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,003
It says "Land ho!" right there.

1110
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:49,245
- You can float away on it.
- Riverboat.

1111
00:55:49,287 --> 00:55:50,346
Great for your back
and your neck.

1112
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,511
And you could just
float away on a boat.

1113
00:55:51,553 --> 00:55:52,574
Right on your back,
or right here.

1114
00:55:52,616 --> 00:55:53,681
And Arabian vinyl

1115
00:55:53,723 --> 00:55:55,075
- is the best kind of vinyl.
- It's the best kind.

1116
00:55:55,117 --> 00:55:57,151
Nothing will puncture.
We tested it.

1117
00:55:57,193 --> 00:55:58,383
We tested it under, like,

1118
00:55:58,425 --> 00:56:00,352
the worst conditions.

1119
00:56:00,394 --> 00:56:02,184
This is our "Big Bernie."

- It's the "Serious Sleeper."
- That right? Mmm-hmm.

1121
00:56:04,966 --> 00:56:08,766
Um... "It's the classic design

our highest-end model, and also
made from 100% Arabian vinyl.

1131
00:56:38,097 --> 00:56:40,861
This is Fat Bernie's
personal king-size mattress.

1132
00:56:40,903 --> 00:56:44,629
He has the heater, the
headboard, the side ashtrays,

1133
00:56:44,671 --> 00:56:46,798
- and the lamp fixtures.
- Hmm.

1134
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,898
And what happens
if Fat Bernie falls asleep

1135
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,567
while he's smoking
in his waterbed?

1136
00:56:50,609 --> 00:56:52,139
That is a great question.

1137
00:56:52,181 --> 00:56:55,474
Actually, the water is too cold to
allow the cigarette to burn through.

1138
00:56:55,516 --> 00:56:56,979
- Oh, that's smart.
- Uh-huh.

1139
00:56:57,021 --> 00:56:58,175
So, it's cold?

1140
00:56:58,217 --> 00:57:00,814
Well, in the summer, it is,
and in the winter, it isn't.

00:57:09,863 --> 00:57:12,426
Fat Bernie's waterbeds,

Hi, welcome to Fat Bernie's.

1147
00:57:15,774 --> 00:57:16,771
Hi.

you can do it.

00:57:22,037 --> 00:57:24,735
Hi. And who is this, Gary?

1152
00:57:24,777 --> 00:57:28,001
Gary. Hi. I'm the manager here.

1153
00:57:28,043 --> 00:57:29,177

it's nice to meet you.

1157
00:57:33,887 --> 00:57:35,685
Hey, Gary, can I steal you
for a second?

1158
00:57:35,727 --> 00:57:38,781
I just wanna see how you want
these orders written out.

1159
00:57:38,823 --> 00:57:40,025
I'll be right there.

1160
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:42,592
Well, I really need
to know soon,

1161
00:57:42,634 --> 00:57:44,825
because I really want
the paperwork to be correct.

1162
00:57:44,867 --> 00:57:46,854
We don't wanna get it wrong
on the first day, do we?

1163
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:48,033
I'll be right there.

1164
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,036
Is everything okay?

1165
00:57:54,078 --> 00:57:55,434
Yes, of course.

1166
00:57:55,476 --> 00:57:56,502
Is that your girlfriend?

1167
00:57:56,544 --> 00:57:57,703
No, that is not my girlfriend.

1168
00:57:57,745 --> 00:57:59,637
Does it seem like
she's my girlfriend?

1169
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:00,683
Kind of.

1170
00:58:01,316 --> 00:58:02,705
No. I mean...

1171
00:58:02,747 --> 00:58:04,213
No. She works for me.

1172
00:58:04,255 --> 00:58:05,615
She used to be my babysitter.

1173
00:58:05,657 --> 00:58:06,874
Now, I'm gonna take you
over here. This is the...

1174
00:58:33,714 --> 00:58:35,014
I'm so high.

1175
00:58:35,714 --> 00:58:37,621

1176
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:40,908
Okay...

1177
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:42,843
I'm very happy, Gary.

1178
00:58:42,885 --> 00:58:43,921
Mmm-hmm.

1179
00:58:43,963 --> 00:58:46,422
Congratulations.

1180
00:58:46,464 --> 00:58:48,248
We did this together,
didn't we?

1181
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:50,422
- Uh-huh. We did. Okay.
- We did it.

1182
00:58:50,464 --> 00:58:51,800
Are you happy?

1183
01:00:59,693 --> 01:01:00,731
Oh, shit.

I didn't say a word.

01:01:53,977 --> 01:01:55,842
It gets better.

1201
01:01:55,884 --> 01:01:57,206
You have to
pass through "Faithful"

1202
01:01:57,248 --> 01:01:58,879
to get there.

1203
01:01:58,921 --> 01:02:01,216
That must be quite
some cross to bear.

1204
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:07,617
My parents are dead.

1205
01:02:07,659 --> 01:02:11,459
They were killed in an automobile
accident five years ago.

1206
01:02:11,501 --> 01:02:14,225
They were nice people.

1207
01:02:14,267 --> 01:02:16,939
Nothing really happens
in Intercourse, you know.

1208
01:02:18,137 --> 01:02:20,629
So as soon as
I graduated high school,

1209
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:24,573
I grabbed my bag and my guitar,
and I came to California.

1210
01:02:27,351 --> 01:02:29,206
And, cut-a-rooski.

1211
01:02:29,248 --> 01:02:31,822
- That was wonderful.
- Thank you, Alana.

1212
01:02:32,757 --> 01:02:34,616
This says you know
how to ride a horse.

1213
01:02:34,983 --> 01:02:36,484
Yes.

1214
01:02:36,526 --> 01:02:38,191
And you speak Portuguese.

1215
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:39,952
Mmm-hmm.

1216
01:02:39,994 --> 01:02:42,922
Rainbow loves horses
and archery.

1217
01:02:42,964 --> 01:02:44,995
That's a subplot
we've been developing.

1218
01:02:45,037 --> 01:02:47,729
We would wanna make sure that
actresses under consideration

1219
01:02:47,771 --> 01:02:49,893
are capable
of doing these things.

1220
01:02:49,935 --> 01:02:51,303
Yes, I can do both.

1221
01:02:53,107 --> 01:02:55,839
Thank you, Alana.
Thank you for coming.

1222
01:02:55,881 --> 01:02:58,340
I feel like I've been with
Rainbow for 10 minutes,

1223
01:02:58,382 --> 01:02:59,542
don't you, Jack?

1224
01:03:00,482 --> 01:03:01,544
Absolutely.

1225
01:03:02,443 --> 01:03:03,986
Thank you, Mr. Holden.

1226
01:03:08,226 --> 01:03:09,453
You know...

1227
01:03:10,395 --> 01:03:13,556
you remind me of Grace.

1228
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,066
Kelly?

1229
01:03:30,982 --> 01:03:33,101
Mr. Holden,

1230
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:34,676
another martini, sir?

1231
01:03:35,143 --> 01:03:36,183
Yes, please.

1232
01:03:36,748 --> 01:03:37,811
Another?

1233
01:03:38,222 --> 01:03:39,880
Sure.

1234
01:03:39,922 --> 01:03:42,178
- Make it three.
- Okay.

1235
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:44,752
I've never had
a martini before.

1236
01:03:45,495 --> 01:03:47,029
They're good.

1237
01:03:50,499 --> 01:03:51,759
The jungle.

1238
01:03:53,032 --> 01:03:54,696
That's where I'm most myself.

1239
01:03:56,275 --> 01:03:57,534
Not this jungle.

1240
01:03:59,034 --> 01:04:00,042
Africa.

1241
01:04:01,346 --> 01:04:04,734
Oh. Yes, Africa.

1242
01:04:04,776 --> 01:04:09,282
I saw two of my best Black
friends beheaded in the Congo.

1243
01:04:10,449 --> 01:04:13,682
I'll tell you intimacies
I've shared with no one.

1244
01:04:17,025 --> 01:04:19,622
But don't ask me
about Kuala Lumpur.

1245
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:24,132
Is this lines

1246
01:04:24,963 --> 01:04:26,695
or is this real?

1247
01:04:29,807 --> 01:04:31,799
You're such
a delicate creature.

1248
01:04:33,477 --> 01:04:35,209
You are Rainbow.

1249
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:38,099
I'm Jewish.

1250
01:04:40,143 --> 01:04:41,710
What's funny?

1251
01:04:44,412 --> 01:04:46,240
It's true.

1252
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:49,157
Is that Rex damn Blau?

1253
01:04:49,757 --> 01:04:51,048
Who said Blau?

1254
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:53,656
Right over here. Blau!

1255
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:57,085
Jack!

1256
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:58,221
Wait till you meet

1257
01:04:58,263 --> 01:05:00,191
this character.

1258
01:05:00,233 --> 01:05:04,131
Jack goddamn Holden. Bang.

1259
01:05:04,173 --> 01:05:07,469
You son of a bitch from hell,
get over here.

1260
01:05:07,511 --> 01:05:09,802
You shiny, golden,

1261
01:05:09,844 --> 01:05:13,373
tall, inexpensive prick.

1262
01:05:13,415 --> 01:05:15,874
- My goodness.
- It's so good to see you.

1263
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:17,206
There is God's...

1264
01:05:20,355 --> 01:05:22,248
Think of any six
numbers, I can guess them.

1265
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:23,651
- Okay.
- I can guess them. All right.

1266
01:05:23,693 --> 01:05:24,883
- Okay.
- You're thinking

1267
01:05:24,925 --> 01:05:28,589
six, three, four, five.

1268
01:05:28,631 --> 01:05:29,925
- Hey.
- Henri!

1269
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:31,225
- Always happy to see you.
- Good to see you.

1270
01:05:31,267 --> 01:05:32,562
- Good to see you as well.
- Yeah, are you staying?

1271
01:05:32,604 --> 01:05:34,556
I'm great, yes. Of course.

1272
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:36,699
Hey. We can always do
take-out tonight.

1273
01:05:37,939 --> 01:05:38,962
- He looks around.
- No way.

1274
01:05:39,004 --> 01:05:40,043
He's all scruffy.

1275
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:44,841
Interesting development
to the plot, Henri.

1276
01:05:44,883 --> 01:05:47,400
Well, let's not have
any trouble, please.

1277
01:05:47,442 --> 01:05:48,669
No trouble, no trouble.

1278
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:49,973
This is Tail o' the Cock,
this is my place.

1279
01:05:50,015 --> 01:05:51,276
Yes, I'm staying.

1280
01:05:51,318 --> 01:05:52,982
It's a table for four, please.
Table 38?

1281
01:05:53,024 --> 01:05:54,916
Well, tonight you might want
a different table.

1282
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:56,343
- What do you think?
- Table 38, Henri.

1283
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:57,983
With direct sight lines.

1284
01:05:58,025 --> 01:06:00,954
Direct sight lines, huh? Okay.

1285
01:06:07,033 --> 01:06:08,764
Oh, no.

1286
01:06:08,806 --> 01:06:11,140
Full of gas
on the railroad.

1287
01:06:12,734 --> 01:06:15,695
Now, you know what
I'd like to say...

1288
01:06:15,737 --> 01:06:17,540
Have you ever seen him
on a bike?

1289
01:06:17,582 --> 01:06:18,868
I see it spin.

1290
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,268
Good.

1291
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:21,977
I know you know I knew

1292
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:24,879
- and know I do.
- No. Yeah, well...

1293
01:06:24,921 --> 01:06:26,614
I'm patient. I'm a patient man.

1294
01:06:26,656 --> 01:06:28,546
The hell you are.

1295
01:06:28,588 --> 01:06:30,545
There is this kind of
a biblical feeling...

1296
01:06:30,587 --> 01:06:31,711
Yeah, but...
It's just not.

1297
01:06:31,753 --> 01:06:33,349
Someone
will be right over.

1298
01:06:33,391 --> 01:06:34,880
- Thank you, Henri.
- Thank you.

1299
01:06:34,922 --> 01:06:36,391
Watch, you gotta watch him.

1300
01:06:36,433 --> 01:06:37,486
Oh, yeah.

1301
01:06:37,528 --> 01:06:39,560
Oh, no.
Whatever it isn't.

1302
01:06:39,602 --> 01:06:40,824
Jack,

1303
01:06:40,866 --> 01:06:43,466
you know what I got out there
in the parking lot right now?

1304
01:06:45,402 --> 01:06:46,604
- Right on.
- Mmm.

1305
01:06:47,235 --> 01:06:49,001
650cc.

1306
01:06:49,043 --> 01:06:52,031
No, no. You mischievous man.

1307
01:06:52,073 --> 01:06:55,448
A full desert sled.
It's out there for you, Jack.

1308
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:57,981
It's built for you.

1309
01:06:58,023 --> 01:06:59,906
- I'm seeing it spin now.
- It's spinning.

1310
01:06:59,948 --> 01:07:02,785
I know it's spinning,
and it's gotta spin back.

1311
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:04,921
Come on,
you know you want it.

1312
01:07:04,963 --> 01:07:06,756
- No.
- You know you need it.

1313
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:08,419
Oh, yeah, you do.

1314
01:07:08,461 --> 01:07:10,583
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah, you bet.

1315
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:12,421
Gary, Gary, Gary, I see Alana.

1316
01:07:12,463 --> 01:07:15,161
Kirk,
assassin's focus.

1317
01:07:15,203 --> 01:07:17,099
Gritted teeth
and fixed bayonets.

1318
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:26,842
- Armand!
- Okay. Bastard.

1319
01:07:26,884 --> 01:07:27,937
What are you guys
talking about?

1320
01:07:27,979 --> 01:07:29,369
Bastard.

1321
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:31,042
What are we doing?

1322
01:07:31,084 --> 01:07:32,412
Yes, Mr. Rex?

1323
01:07:32,454 --> 01:07:35,443
Armand, I need three
wing-back chairs from the bar,

1324
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:36,711
I need a bottle of Everclear,

1325
01:07:36,753 --> 01:07:39,087
I need plenty of grease
from the kitchen.

1326
01:07:39,129 --> 01:07:41,221
And I want you to meet me
on the eighth hole

1327
01:07:41,263 --> 01:07:44,955
by the sand trap,
<i>dos minutos. Pronto.</i>

1328
01:07:44,997 --> 01:07:46,354
<i>Apurarse.</i>

1329
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,123
We're burning daylight!

1330
01:07:50,306 --> 01:07:53,671
I gotta do some prep.
I'll see you kids later.

1331
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:04,814
Did you see <i>No Time for Honor?</i>

1332
01:08:04,856 --> 01:08:06,147
- With Jack Holden?
- Yeah.

1333
01:08:06,189 --> 01:08:07,815
Do you guys
wanna order martinis?

1334
01:08:07,857 --> 01:08:09,644
I can get us martinis.

1335
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:11,458
I'll get us
four martinis right now.

1336
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:16,423
"The Bridges span a narrow gap
between two targets.

1337
01:08:16,465 --> 01:08:20,096
They're the most important
targets in all of Korea.

1338
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:22,832
Consequently,
they're fortified accordingly.

1339
01:08:24,274 --> 01:08:26,998
Although we're only over
the targets 30 seconds,

1340
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,442
it's a lifetime."

1341
01:08:30,044 --> 01:08:31,841
We're going to Korea?

1342
01:08:33,344 --> 01:08:35,304
I don't understand.

1343
01:08:35,346 --> 01:08:36,910
But I'm sexy, right?

1344
01:08:36,952 --> 01:08:39,806
"Every gun imaginable

1345
01:08:39,848 --> 01:08:41,774
is hidden in those mountainsides.

1346
01:08:41,816 --> 01:08:44,178
And the men behind the guns..."

1347
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,316
Mmm-hmm.

1348
01:08:45,358 --> 01:08:47,316
"They know where
we're coming from

1349
01:08:47,358 --> 01:08:48,792
and where we're headed.

1350
01:08:50,364 --> 01:08:52,587
We're gonna fly
right between them.

1351
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:55,831
We're gonna fly
low and straight

1352
01:08:55,873 --> 01:08:58,658
with no element of surprise.

1353
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,540
And they're just sitting there

1354
01:09:01,173 --> 01:09:02,674
waiting for us,

1355
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:04,907
hoping we'll come.

1356
01:09:09,076 --> 01:09:13,442
Those are the Bridges
of Toko-San, Nancy."

1357
01:09:13,484 --> 01:09:15,212
Ladies and gentlemen,

1358
01:09:15,254 --> 01:09:17,445
good people of The Cock,

1359
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,282
put that dinner down.

1360
01:09:19,324 --> 01:09:21,856
That salad can wait.

1361
01:09:21,898 --> 01:09:25,319
Let that steak get cold.

1362
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:30,129
'Cause tonight, we have a man who
needs no introduction, really.

1363
01:09:30,171 --> 01:09:32,297
His name is Mr. Jack Holden.

1364
01:09:37,078 --> 01:09:38,205
That's right.

1365
01:09:38,247 --> 01:09:41,144
And if you've seen
his pictures,

1366
01:09:41,186 --> 01:09:44,508
then you know
that every goddamn one of them

1367
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:47,376
has got Jack riding
a motorcycle,

1368
01:09:47,418 --> 01:09:49,512
as if it's the only way

1369
01:09:49,554 --> 01:09:51,484
to travel.

1370
01:09:51,526 --> 01:09:55,218
Whether he's in the jungle,
or he's in Manila,

1371
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:57,222
or he's in Paris,

1372
01:09:57,264 --> 01:10:00,392
or if he's in Rio de Janeiro.

1373
01:10:00,434 --> 01:10:03,358
They don't have taxis
in the desert.

1374
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:05,935
Thank you, Jack.

1375
01:10:07,075 --> 01:10:08,864
And for those of you

1376
01:10:08,906 --> 01:10:12,732
who perhaps may have seen
a little film called,

1377
01:10:12,774 --> 01:10:15,339
<i>The Bridges of Toko-San...</i>

1378
01:10:15,381 --> 01:10:16,748
Yeah.

1379
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:19,586
Kirk.

1380
01:10:20,889 --> 01:10:22,016
Jack

1381
01:10:22,058 --> 01:10:26,717
and the beautiful Grace Kelly.

1382
01:10:26,759 --> 01:10:31,059
Well, tonight, you're lucky,
'cause tonight,

1383
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:35,569
we bring Toko-San
right here to Encino.

1384
01:10:39,009 --> 01:10:40,935
That's right. That's right.

1385
01:10:40,977 --> 01:10:42,733
Thank you. Thank you.

1386
01:10:42,775 --> 01:10:46,103
On your feet now,
follow me to the eighth hole.

1387
01:10:46,145 --> 01:10:47,482
Here we go.

1388
01:10:49,987 --> 01:10:51,486
Would you mind to play Grace?

1389
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,775
Jack, I don't know
how to ride a motorcycle.

1390
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:56,755
You just have to hold on tight.

1391
01:10:57,926 --> 01:10:59,451
Let's ride.

1392
01:10:59,493 --> 01:11:02,596
That's my Rainbow.
Rainbow rides.

1393
01:11:03,858 --> 01:11:07,787
Fire up those torches! Now!

1394
01:11:07,829 --> 01:11:10,327
Hold on, people. Single file.

1395
01:11:10,369 --> 01:11:13,765
Single file. There we go.

1396
01:11:13,807 --> 01:11:18,172
Okay. Right along the ridge.
Right along the ridge.

1397
01:11:18,883 --> 01:11:20,469
Thank you, good people.

1398
01:11:22,613 --> 01:11:23,640
Okay, Armand,

1399
01:11:23,682 --> 01:11:25,619
will you handle
that crowd for me?

1400
01:11:25,986 --> 01:11:27,049
Okay.

1401
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:33,612
All right, people.
I need some more flame.

1402
01:11:33,654 --> 01:11:35,123
More flame.

1403
01:11:38,295 --> 01:11:39,699
God.

1404
01:11:40,862 --> 01:11:43,162
It's a great night for a jump.

1405
01:11:49,343 --> 01:11:51,132
I can't believe it!

1406
01:11:51,174 --> 01:11:52,208
He came here.
He's definitely gonna do it.

1407
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:53,603
I can't wait
to see this shit.

1408
01:11:53,645 --> 01:11:54,813
Oh,
he's gonna do it.

1409
01:12:15,102 --> 01:12:16,406
All right.

1410
01:12:17,868 --> 01:12:20,366
Can I have some quiet
on the set?

1411
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:22,610
Roll sound.

1412
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,272
Roll camera A.

1413
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:27,450
Roll camera B.

1414
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:30,915
Okay. Mark it.

1415
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:36,789
Action, Jack.

1416
01:12:41,563 --> 01:12:44,390
Do you even remember
what my real name is?

1417
01:12:45,595 --> 01:12:48,064
Whoa.

1418
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:58,371
Keep your gas.
Attaboy. Attaboy.

1419
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,916
Looks like he's coming in hot.

1420
01:13:06,088 --> 01:13:09,459
I'm coming, Nancy!

1421
01:13:10,992 --> 01:13:12,052
Yeah!

1422
01:13:21,765 --> 01:13:23,228
I fucked up Danielle's guitar.

1423
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:24,528
Are you okay?

1424
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:26,674
I fucked up Danielle's guitar.

1425
01:13:28,977 --> 01:13:30,744
Oh, man.

1426
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:38,276
I'm all right!

1427
01:13:45,923 --> 01:13:48,490
<i>Toko-San! Toko-San!</i>

1428
01:13:48,532 --> 01:13:51,993
<i>Toko-San! Toko-San!
Toko-San! Toko-San!</i>

1429
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:57,133
This man needs a drink!

1430
01:13:57,175 --> 01:13:59,224
- To the Cock!
- To the Cock!

1431
01:14:01,969 --> 01:14:04,499
<i>Toko-San! Toko-San!</i>

1432
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:06,274
<i>Toko-San!</i>

1433
01:14:11,055 --> 01:14:13,940
<i>Toko-San! Toko-San!</i>

<i>...decided to
use their oil as a political weapon.</i>

1435
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:18,139
<i>They will reduce oil production</i>

1436
01:16:18,181 --> 01:16:19,808
<i>by 5% a month</i>

1437
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:23,073
<i>until the Israelis withdraw
from occupied territory.</i>

1438
01:16:23,115 --> 01:16:24,743
<i>If the Arab countries
keep that pledge,</i>

1439
01:16:24,785 --> 01:16:26,875
<i>it would reduce
their production</i>

1440
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:29,576
<i>by almost 50% in one year.</i>

1441
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:31,112
<i>According
to some of our leaders,</i>

1442
01:16:31,154 --> 01:16:33,986
<i>as the Arab
oil embargo continues,</i>

1443
01:16:34,028 --> 01:16:36,484
<i>the situation will become
increasingly worse</i>

1444
01:16:36,526 --> 01:16:40,123
<i>and we may be forced into
a gas rationing program.</i>

1445
01:16:40,165 --> 01:16:41,291
<i>The immediate shortage</i>

1446
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:44,228
<i>will affect the lives
of each and every one of us.</i>

1447
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:46,830
<i>In our factories, our cars,
our homes, our offices,</i>

1448
01:16:46,872 --> 01:16:49,229
<i>we will have to use less fuel</i>

1449
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,099
<i>than we are
accustomed to using.</i>

1450
01:16:51,141 --> 01:16:53,641
<i>The fuel crisis need
not mean...</i>

1451
01:16:53,683 --> 01:16:55,843
Did you know there was
an oil embargo?

1452
01:16:55,885 --> 01:16:58,178
<i>...require
some sacrifice by all.</i>

1453
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,073
Wait, what?

1454
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:01,647
Do you understand any of this?

1455
01:17:03,561 --> 01:17:05,115
<i>Major tie-ups like these</i>

1456
01:17:05,157 --> 01:17:07,856
<i>are becoming more frequent
in Los Angeles.</i>

1457
01:17:07,898 --> 01:17:09,323
- <i>Will your gas supplies...</i>
- Huh?

1458
01:17:09,365 --> 01:17:10,359
<i>...hold out very long?</i>

1459
01:17:11,128 --> 01:17:14,020
The beds are made
from vinyl, Gary.

1460
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:16,293
Vinyl is made from oil.

1461
01:17:16,335 --> 01:17:17,427
<i>Do you have
any idea what that means?</i>

1462
01:17:17,469 --> 01:17:18,591
It is?

1463
01:17:18,633 --> 01:17:20,664
Fucking duh. What did you
think it was made out of?

1464
01:17:20,706 --> 01:17:21,764
- Gold?
- I don't know.

1465
01:17:21,806 --> 01:17:23,967
I thought it was, um...

1466
01:17:24,009 --> 01:17:26,373
- What? Magic?
- I thought it was...

1467
01:17:26,415 --> 01:17:27,475
Like a scientific fabric.

1468
01:17:27,517 --> 01:17:28,850
I thought it was like a rubber.

1469
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:34,206
Which is also made
out of oil, dipshit.

1470
01:17:34,248 --> 01:17:37,145
<i>Filled up. Have to wait till
I got some money to get it filled up.</i>

1471
01:17:37,187 --> 01:17:38,683
<i>I tried to pump gas</i>

1472
01:17:38,725 --> 01:17:40,113
<i>on the way home last night</i>

1473
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:41,686
<i>and had a little success.</i>

1474
01:17:41,728 --> 01:17:43,225
<i>What little money I had on me,</i>

1475
01:17:43,267 --> 01:17:46,824
<i>I got a couple of dollars' worth,
but, I'm afraid for the weekend.</i>

1476
01:18:10,088 --> 01:18:12,586
It's the end
of the world, Greggo.

1477
01:20:01,305 --> 01:20:02,495
Hey, fellas.

1478
01:20:02,537 --> 01:20:03,532
Hello.

1479
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:06,797
Which one is in charge?
Are you? Are you in charge?

1480
01:20:06,839 --> 01:20:08,001
Yeah, I'm in charge.

1481
01:20:08,043 --> 01:20:09,768
May I just speak with you
for a second?

1482
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:10,968
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

1483
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:12,132
You can tell your crew to stop.

1484
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:13,344
Stop for a sec, guys.

1485
01:20:14,074 --> 01:20:15,247
Um...

1486
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,036
So, this is what
I wanna say to you.

1487
01:20:18,078 --> 01:20:19,086
Um...

1488
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:22,310
- Do you know who I am?
- Yeah.

1489
01:20:22,352 --> 01:20:23,816
Do you know who
my girlfriend is?

1490
01:20:24,823 --> 01:20:26,027
Barbra Streisand.

1491
01:20:26,694 --> 01:20:27,821
Barbra "Streisand."

1492
01:20:27,863 --> 01:20:29,320
- "Sand."
- "Sand." Yeah, like "sands."

1493
01:20:29,362 --> 01:20:31,557
- Like the ocean, like beaches.
- Barbra Streisand.

1494
01:20:31,599 --> 01:20:33,194
No. "Streisand."

1495
01:20:33,236 --> 01:20:34,563
"Sand."

1496
01:20:34,605 --> 01:20:36,565
- "Streisand."
- "Streisand."

1497
01:20:38,937 --> 01:20:40,206
"Barbra Streisand."

1498
01:20:41,742 --> 01:20:43,044
"Barbra Streisand."

1499
01:20:44,779 --> 01:20:45,948
Are you fucking with me?

1500
01:20:46,782 --> 01:20:48,006
All right, let's get past that.

1501
01:20:48,048 --> 01:20:49,469
Hopefully, you never
fucking meet her.

1502
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:51,875
She'll fucking...
You think I'm bad.

1503
01:20:51,917 --> 01:20:54,681
So, we're going to the movies right
now and I'm on my way to pick her up,

1504
01:20:54,723 --> 01:20:56,142
so I'm gonna leave you here.

1505
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:58,548
But, I wouldn't normally leave somebody
in my house when I'm not there,

1506
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:00,712
but I have to because you guys
are so motherfucking late.

1507
01:21:00,754 --> 01:21:02,081
- I'm sorry. There was no gas.
- Yeah, well,

1508
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:04,758
that's an excuse I'm gonna shove
up your fucking penis hole, man.

1509
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:07,891
What's your name?

1510
01:21:07,933 --> 01:21:09,894
- Gary.
- Gary. Gary.

1511
01:21:09,936 --> 01:21:11,257
How big is your penis hole?

1512
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:12,764
It's regular sized.

1513
01:21:12,806 --> 01:21:14,336
Hmm. How would you know?

1514
01:21:14,378 --> 01:21:17,365
Imagine what that would feel like,
if I shoved that excuse up there.

1515
01:21:17,407 --> 01:21:19,674
- That would hurt a lot, right?
- Yeah.

1516
01:21:19,716 --> 01:21:21,602
But that's what I'd like to do.

1517
01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:23,272
I'm sorry, I don't wanna
make you any more late

1518
01:21:23,314 --> 01:21:24,987
than you already are.
You can leave.

1519
01:21:25,987 --> 01:21:27,880
Look at you,
you cocky motherfucker.

1520
01:21:29,623 --> 01:21:30,718
I like it.

1521
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:39,361
We speak the same language, huh?
We're both from the streets.

1522
01:21:39,403 --> 01:21:40,521
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1523
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:42,897
I didn't see it before.
That's... Wow.

1524
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:45,358
Wow, you get right in there
and you do it.

1525
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,395
Wow. You have a little, um...

1526
01:21:47,437 --> 01:21:48,728
You have a tincture
in your left eye.

1527
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:51,034
It means that you're deficient
in vitamin K.

1528
01:21:51,076 --> 01:21:52,436
I'm like a fucking doctor.

1529
01:21:52,478 --> 01:21:55,610
You need to take more vitamin D
and cod liver oil.

1530
01:21:55,652 --> 01:21:56,974
You see that Daytona Ferrari?

1531
01:21:57,016 --> 01:21:58,911
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's mine.

1532
01:22:00,151 --> 01:22:01,608
Gary, that's filled with gas.

1533
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:03,742
That's gonna get me
to the movies on time.

1534
01:22:03,784 --> 01:22:05,277
'Cause I'm not
a shithead idiot fuck-up,

1535
01:22:05,319 --> 01:22:06,451
I'm Jon Peters.

1536
01:22:06,493 --> 01:22:09,085
My only problem in life
is that I love tail too much.

1537
01:22:09,127 --> 01:22:11,033
I love it. I love it so much.

1538
01:22:12,029 --> 01:22:13,122
I love it so much.

1539
01:22:13,164 --> 01:22:14,761
- Is that your sister?
- No.

1540
01:22:14,803 --> 01:22:16,467
- It's your girlfriend?
- No.

1541
01:22:21,011 --> 01:22:23,210
I love it so much,
it's gonna kill me one day.

1542
01:22:24,376 --> 01:22:25,935
- You know how much tail I get?
- No.

1543
01:22:25,977 --> 01:22:27,016
All of it.

1544
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,437
It's all mine.

1545
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:30,943
- You like Barbra Streisand?
- Yeah...

1546
01:22:31,555 --> 01:22:33,272
- You do?
- Mmm-hmm.

1547
01:22:33,314 --> 01:22:34,386
Do you?

1548
01:22:34,885 --> 01:22:35,882
Yeah.

1549
01:22:38,021 --> 01:22:39,511
I do, too.

1550
01:22:39,553 --> 01:22:41,063
Gets boring, but you know...

1551
01:22:42,059 --> 01:22:43,825
Yeah.

1552
01:22:43,867 --> 01:22:45,857
I'm gonna kill you
and your family

1553
01:22:45,899 --> 01:22:47,465
if you fuck up my house.

1554
01:22:48,906 --> 01:22:50,931
- Okay? Do you have a cat?
- No. No.

1555
01:22:50,973 --> 01:22:52,100
- You got a dog?
- No.

1556
01:22:52,142 --> 01:22:53,628
- Your brother and sister...
- Brother.

1557
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:55,034
Yeah. Your brother?
I'm gonna fucking choke

1558
01:22:55,076 --> 01:22:56,268
your brother out
right in front of you.

1559
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:58,841
Okay, Steve's gonna look
after you while I'm gone.

1560
01:22:58,883 --> 01:23:00,708
Uh, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Gary.

1561
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:02,174
I want you to be horrified.

1562
01:23:02,216 --> 01:23:04,140
- Okay.
- Your life's on the line.

1563
01:23:04,182 --> 01:23:06,010
But you know from that, right?

1564
01:23:06,052 --> 01:23:07,254
It's the way of the streets.

1565
01:23:16,896 --> 01:23:18,626
Miss Streisand?

1566
01:23:18,668 --> 01:23:21,155
Hi, it's Steve. Mmm-hmm.

1567
01:23:21,197 --> 01:23:22,566
Yes, he just left.

1568
01:23:24,707 --> 01:23:28,702
I also thought you might wanna know
that he ordered a waterbed this evening.

1569
01:23:28,744 --> 01:23:31,171
Right now. Mmm-hmm.

1570
01:23:31,213 --> 01:23:33,975
Four small children and a girl
or a young woman.

1571
01:23:34,017 --> 01:23:36,204
To be honest,
I don't know what she is.

1572
01:23:36,246 --> 01:23:38,714
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Okay.

1573
01:23:40,355 --> 01:23:45,127
Yes. Sure will. Thanks,
Miss Streisand. Uh-huh. Bye.

1574
01:23:45,626 --> 01:23:46,920
Okay.

1575
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:07,380
I used to work
with Julie Andrews.

1576
01:24:07,615 --> 01:24:08,612
Oh.

1577
01:24:13,051 --> 01:24:14,717
She was difficult.

1578
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:16,785
Mmm-hmm.

1579
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:28,060
He said he was gonna kill Greg.

1580
01:25:07,634 --> 01:25:08,936
We're done, let's go.

1581
01:25:20,182 --> 01:25:21,241
Boo.

1582
01:25:24,287 --> 01:25:25,491
Jerks.

1583
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:28,786
"I'm gonna choke your brother."

1584
01:25:28,828 --> 01:25:29,825
Uh-huh.

1585
01:25:30,992 --> 01:25:33,091
I kept it inside,
but what I wanted to say was,

1586
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:35,028
"No, I'm gonna choke you."

1587
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:36,426
- Oh, yeah?
- I would've said it.

1588
01:25:36,468 --> 01:25:37,831
I was trying
to stay cool though.

1589
01:25:37,873 --> 01:25:39,571
I was trying to stay...

1590
01:25:55,185 --> 01:25:56,522
Scooch over.

1591
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:02,924
Back it up. Oh, fuck.

1592
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:08,496
We're going back
up the hill, okay?

1593
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:09,733
Okay.

1594
01:26:12,071 --> 01:26:13,295
How'd it turn out?

1595
01:26:13,337 --> 01:26:14,662
It was good. Went well.

1596
01:26:14,704 --> 01:26:16,196
You didn't fuck up my house,
did you?

1597
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:17,839
No.

1598
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:19,535
You okay? Can you see okay?

1599
01:26:19,577 --> 01:26:21,071
- Yeah.
- Well, why don't you just...

1600
01:26:21,113 --> 01:26:24,209
Why don't you just back in the
driveway, and then you can go straight.

1601
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:29,621
Steve. Steve.

1602
01:26:41,303 --> 01:26:44,697
You blew it, man.
You blew it. Did she call?

1603
01:26:44,739 --> 01:26:45,866
No.

1604
01:26:45,908 --> 01:26:47,606
God damn it, Steve.

1605
01:26:51,542 --> 01:26:54,737
Where the fuck is the...
God damn.

1606
01:26:54,779 --> 01:26:58,207
There's no gas-o
in the goddamn car-o, Steve-o.

1607
01:26:58,249 --> 01:26:59,552
Motherfucker.

1608
01:27:07,822 --> 01:27:09,430
How long you guys
been together?

1609
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,292
- Me and her?
- Yeah.

1610
01:27:12,334 --> 01:27:14,254
- Oh, we're not together.
- We're not together.

1611
01:27:14,296 --> 01:27:15,304
Why not?

1612
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:17,097
I don't know.

1613
01:27:18,773 --> 01:27:19,770
What?

1614
01:27:20,434 --> 01:27:21,869
I'm 28.

1615
01:27:21,911 --> 01:27:24,270
- What's that?
- I'm 25.

1616
01:27:24,312 --> 01:27:26,007
You're 25?
When's your birthday?

1617
01:27:27,114 --> 01:27:28,274
- December.
- December.

1618
01:27:28,316 --> 01:27:30,308
Are you a Capricorn?
Sagittarius?

1619
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:31,570
- Sagittarius.
- Sagittarius.

1620
01:27:31,612 --> 01:27:33,111
December what? 13?

1621
01:27:33,153 --> 01:27:34,981
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen.

1622
01:27:35,023 --> 01:27:36,457
I was only two off.

1623
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:41,256
What do you wanna do
if you're not gonna do hair?

1624
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:43,662
Do you have sisters,
or brothers, or anything?

1625
01:27:43,963 --> 01:27:45,091
Sisters.

1626
01:27:45,133 --> 01:27:46,451
Are they older or younger?

1627
01:27:46,493 --> 01:27:47,554
Older.

1628
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:48,931
So you're the youngest?

1629
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:53,125
How about your dad?

1630
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:55,100
Do you have a good relationship
with your dad?

1631
01:27:55,142 --> 01:27:56,675
- Yeah.
- What's he do?

1632
01:27:58,143 --> 01:27:59,266
Real estate.

1633
01:27:59,308 --> 01:28:00,942
Oh, yeah?

1634
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:02,384
Did he teach you how to drive?

1635
01:28:03,315 --> 01:28:04,570
You're really good at it.

1636
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:06,641
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1637
01:28:06,683 --> 01:28:09,721
It's not easy.
Gary can't do it.

1638
01:28:18,326 --> 01:28:20,732
All right. Just slow it down now, okay?
There she is.

1639
01:28:22,029 --> 01:28:24,593
Okay, do you have
enough room? Yeah?

1640
01:28:24,635 --> 01:28:26,360
- Mm-hmm.
- You sure?

1641
01:28:26,402 --> 01:28:27,533
I think so.

1642
01:28:27,575 --> 01:28:28,837
I parked on the side
so no one would hit it.

1643
01:28:28,879 --> 01:28:30,132
You know what? Here.

1644
01:28:30,174 --> 01:28:32,305
I don't want you to have to bear
the burden in case we hit it.

1645
01:28:32,347 --> 01:28:33,935
Here, why don't
I take the wheel,

1646
01:28:33,977 --> 01:28:35,504
and then you just
put your foot on the clutch

1647
01:28:35,546 --> 01:28:36,772
and just feather the brake.

1648
01:28:36,814 --> 01:28:38,809
That's it.
We'll do it together, okay?

1649
01:28:38,851 --> 01:28:42,108
Yeah, we'll do it together, okay?
Here we go.

1650
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:45,881
Oh, yeah. Smooth.
Smooth, yeah. Just breathe.

1651
01:28:45,923 --> 01:28:49,355
We got it. Yeah, we got it.
I think we got it.

1652
01:28:49,397 --> 01:28:51,990
Look. Look, look. Over there.
You see?

1653
01:28:52,032 --> 01:28:53,094
We got it.

1654
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:55,864
We did it.

1655
01:28:55,906 --> 01:28:57,789
That's so good, Alana.

1656
01:28:57,831 --> 01:29:00,699
Oh.

1657
01:29:00,741 --> 01:29:02,561
- Yeah. No.
- We didn't hit it at all.

1658
01:29:02,603 --> 01:29:03,829
I...

1659
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:06,712
Oh, you smell so good. Whoo!

1660
01:29:07,678 --> 01:29:10,716
Gary. Gary, Gary, Gary.

1661
01:29:11,551 --> 01:29:13,851
Get some gas,
I'll be on my way.

1662
01:29:16,688 --> 01:29:20,286
Oh, shit.
Look at this line, man.

1663
01:29:22,627 --> 01:29:24,421
Fucking sardines
packed in a can.

1664
01:29:24,463 --> 01:29:25,822
Go, just make a left here.

1665
01:29:25,864 --> 01:29:28,057
I'm not fucking waiting
in this motherfucker.

1666
01:29:28,099 --> 01:29:30,195
All right, let that car just go past.
There you go.

1667
01:29:30,237 --> 01:29:31,662
Okay, now, stop it.

1668
01:29:31,704 --> 01:29:33,498
Oh, they'll...
They'll move out of the way.

1669
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,873
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Okay, stop the car.

1670
01:29:38,645 --> 01:29:43,374
God! Fuck. Son of a bitch.
Fucking shit!

1671
01:29:43,416 --> 01:29:44,948
What you got, motherfucker?

1672
01:29:45,715 --> 01:29:48,044
Fucking Chumash Territory!

1673
01:29:48,086 --> 01:29:50,316
Goddamn sons of bitches
don't even know where they are.

1674
01:29:53,824 --> 01:29:55,992
Yeah, motherfucker,
that's right.

1675
01:29:57,099 --> 01:29:58,632
It's my nozzle now.

1676
01:29:59,662 --> 01:30:01,194
Go. Let's go. Let's go.

1677
01:30:01,236 --> 01:30:02,429
- Just reverse it.
- Now?

1678
01:30:02,471 --> 01:30:04,394
Reverse, reverse, reverse.

1679
01:30:04,436 --> 01:30:06,397
- It's your move!
- Okay.

1680
01:30:06,439 --> 01:30:08,301
- Relax.
- It's my nozzle.

1681
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,644
Want some gas, Jon?
I got your gas.

1682
01:30:21,686 --> 01:30:23,855
I got your gas right here, Jon.

1683
01:30:24,522 --> 01:30:26,627
Jon Peters' Ferrari...

1684
01:30:57,684 --> 01:30:58,791
No.

1685
01:30:59,191 --> 01:31:00,419
Come on.

1686
01:31:00,461 --> 01:31:01,794
Oh, no.

1687
01:31:03,725 --> 01:31:04,830
Where are we?

1688
01:31:05,661 --> 01:31:07,827
I don't know.

1689
01:31:07,869 --> 01:31:10,861
No, no, no, we ran out of gas.
You have to push the truck.

1690
01:31:10,903 --> 01:31:12,363
The fuck are you staring at?
Push the truck.

1691
01:31:12,405 --> 01:31:13,542
What are you doing?

1692
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:24,410
Get in.

1693
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:35,657
Hold on.

1694
01:33:07,085 --> 01:33:08,783
If we get lucky
and make the light at Ventura,

1695
01:33:08,825 --> 01:33:11,279
I think I can make a right
and get us to the 76 station.

1696
01:33:11,321 --> 01:33:13,695
If you make the left,
the Mobil station's closer.

1697
01:33:33,272 --> 01:33:34,734
I'm gonna blow this stop sign.

1698
01:33:34,776 --> 01:33:35,882
I trust you.

1699
01:33:52,565 --> 01:33:54,526
Oh!

1700
01:33:54,568 --> 01:33:58,363
Oh, my...
Alana! Hard! Core!

1701
01:33:58,405 --> 01:34:00,259
Hardcore, Alana!

1702
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:02,701
Fellas, you okay back there?
You okay?

1703
01:34:02,743 --> 01:34:05,000
Oh, my... We did it!
We... You...

1704
01:34:05,042 --> 01:34:08,206
Alana, you did it. I...
We did it!

1705
01:34:08,248 --> 01:34:09,375
Oh!

1706
01:34:09,417 --> 01:34:11,313
How did we survive?

1707
01:34:44,682 --> 01:34:45,754
What the...

1708
01:34:48,617 --> 01:34:51,089
It's a goddamn newsstand
in the middle of fucking...

1709
01:34:59,867 --> 01:35:01,528
Yeah, you fucking...
Yeah, that's right.

1710
01:35:09,978 --> 01:35:11,064
Did you hear that
whole thing that went down

1711
01:35:11,106 --> 01:35:12,432
with that other instructor

1712
01:35:12,474 --> 01:35:14,001
at the courts the other day?
It was, like...

1713
01:35:14,043 --> 01:35:15,434
- Hey.
- Hi.

1714
01:35:15,476 --> 01:35:16,772
Do you like
peanut butter sandwiches?

1715
01:35:16,814 --> 01:35:18,271
Peanut butter?

1716
01:35:18,313 --> 01:35:19,942
- Not really. No.
- No?

1717
01:35:19,984 --> 01:35:21,613
Like,
creamy or nutty?

1718
01:35:21,655 --> 01:35:22,974
However you like it.

1719
01:35:23,016 --> 01:35:24,948
I like it a bit nutty.

1720
01:35:24,990 --> 01:35:26,616
Who's got
the better backhand?

1721
01:35:27,994 --> 01:35:29,521
You do.
No, you have the serve.

1722
01:35:29,563 --> 01:35:30,749
You have a bigger serve.

1723
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:32,460
- She's got a good ground game?
- Yeah.

1724
01:35:47,584 --> 01:35:48,966
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Brian?

1725
01:35:49,008 --> 01:35:50,016
<i>Yes?</i>

1726
01:35:50,815 --> 01:35:52,811
Hi, it's Alana Kane.

1727
01:35:52,853 --> 01:35:54,215
<i>Drive their own cars...</i>

1728
01:35:54,257 --> 01:35:55,417
Alana.

1729
01:35:56,249 --> 01:35:59,311
Wow. Hi. How are you?

1730
01:35:59,353 --> 01:36:00,815
<i>I'm good. How are you?</i>

1731
01:36:00,857 --> 01:36:02,325
I'm doing fine.

1732
01:36:03,157 --> 01:36:04,162
What are you doing?

1733
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:06,197
Not much.

1734
01:36:08,103 --> 01:36:11,169
I was calling to see if you
still work for Joel Wachs?

1735
01:36:11,868 --> 01:36:13,962
<i>Yes, I sure do.</i>

1736
01:36:14,004 --> 01:36:15,767
Well, do you need volunteers?

1737
01:36:16,378 --> 01:36:17,846
<i>We always do.</i>

1738
01:36:18,875 --> 01:36:20,046
<i>Do you mean you?</i>

1739
01:36:21,447 --> 01:36:22,510
Yes.

1740
01:36:23,879 --> 01:36:25,341
<i>Alana...</i>

1741
01:36:25,383 --> 01:36:28,506
<i>please come and work with us.
We need you.</i>

1742
01:36:28,548 --> 01:36:29,816
I've seen how
you do your homework.

1743
01:36:29,858 --> 01:36:32,180
<i>Oh, my God,
you remember that?</i>

1744
01:36:32,222 --> 01:36:34,390
Yes, of course.
How could I forget?

1745
01:36:35,726 --> 01:36:36,865
We need you.

1746
01:36:57,980 --> 01:36:59,003
Alana.

1747
01:36:59,045 --> 01:37:00,615
Hi.

1748
01:37:00,657 --> 01:37:02,111
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

1749
01:37:02,153 --> 01:37:03,307
I'm good.
Good, it's good to see you.

1750
01:37:03,349 --> 01:37:04,377
Good to see you, too.

1751
01:37:04,419 --> 01:37:05,551
Let me introduce you
to everybody.

1752
01:37:05,593 --> 01:37:07,214
Welcome to our campaign.

1753
01:37:07,256 --> 01:37:08,389
I'm just gonna
give this to you.

1754
01:37:08,431 --> 01:37:09,953
Tess, this is Alana...

1755
01:37:09,995 --> 01:37:11,220
- Hi.
- ...our newest volunteer.

1756
01:37:11,262 --> 01:37:13,386
- Nice to meet you.
- Over here is Elizabeth.

1757
01:37:13,428 --> 01:37:14,893
We have Richard.
They're in a meeting.

1758
01:37:14,935 --> 01:37:17,293
We have Spencer,
Chuck's on the phone.

1759
01:37:17,335 --> 01:37:20,401
Let me introduce you.
Hey, Ted. Ah, he's busy.

1760
01:37:20,443 --> 01:37:21,629
Don't worry about it.

1761
01:37:21,671 --> 01:37:23,063
So, here's where we're gonna
be spending most of our time.

1762
01:37:23,105 --> 01:37:24,466
We're making phone calls.

1763
01:37:24,508 --> 01:37:26,573
Joel, you're the youngest
councilman in the city,

1764
01:37:26,615 --> 01:37:28,236
you're also its only bachelor.

1765
01:37:28,278 --> 01:37:29,541
- Yes.
- How do you find time

1766
01:37:29,583 --> 01:37:31,207
for a social life?

1767
01:37:31,249 --> 01:37:32,909
Being single means
I have more time to work,

1768
01:37:32,951 --> 01:37:34,574
and a councilman's schedule

1769
01:37:34,616 --> 01:37:36,849
pretty much ruins
the social life anyways, so...

1770
01:37:36,891 --> 01:37:38,752
What do your dates
say about that?

1771
01:37:38,794 --> 01:37:40,246
They're not
saying anything.

1772
01:37:40,288 --> 01:37:42,247
I'm not going on any dates.

1773
01:37:42,289 --> 01:37:43,747
As you can imagine,

1774
01:37:43,789 --> 01:37:45,049
it's probably pretty difficult
for somebody

1775
01:37:45,091 --> 01:37:46,992
to be a part of all the social
events that I'm a part of.

1776
01:37:47,034 --> 01:37:48,427
You know,
keep up with my busy schedule.

1777
01:37:48,469 --> 01:37:49,590
But, um...

1778
01:37:49,632 --> 01:37:52,096
I imagine someday soon
somebody's gonna come along

1779
01:37:52,138 --> 01:37:54,559
who'll wanna share that
with me, so...

1780
01:37:54,601 --> 01:37:56,498
Certainly you have
some prospects?

1781
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:58,101
I can't tell you
how many times I've heard,

1782
01:37:58,143 --> 01:37:59,769
"Boy, have I got
the girl for you."

1783
01:37:59,811 --> 01:38:03,040
And I've met some pretty magnificent
women through my district residents.

1784
01:38:03,082 --> 01:38:04,440
But I'll tell you
what I tell them,

1785
01:38:04,482 --> 01:38:07,615
and that's, "I'm sorry
but my time is spoken for."

1786
01:38:08,383 --> 01:38:10,412
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you.

1787
01:38:10,454 --> 01:38:11,609
Let's get
one photo for the paper,

1788
01:38:11,651 --> 01:38:12,785
if you don't mind,
Councilman Wachs.

1789
01:38:12,827 --> 01:38:15,086
- It's "Wachs."
- Wachs. Wachs.

1790
01:38:15,128 --> 01:38:17,519
If you don't mind,
let's have you... Yeah.

1791
01:38:17,561 --> 01:38:19,190
Let's have you stand with
your mother over here, yeah?

1792
01:38:19,232 --> 01:38:21,085
Have a nice little picture
of you guys, and...

1793
01:38:21,127 --> 01:38:23,128
- For sure.
- Since you're doing so much

1794
01:38:23,170 --> 01:38:24,965
for his campaign.

1795
01:38:25,007 --> 01:38:26,233
There you go.
Put your hand...

1796
01:38:26,275 --> 01:38:28,266
Why don't you put your hand on
her shoulder? And then, ma'am,

1797
01:38:28,308 --> 01:38:29,870
- if you grab the telephone...
- Councilman?

1798
01:38:29,912 --> 01:38:31,272
- Yes?
- We'll handle it, sir.

1799
01:38:31,314 --> 01:38:33,135
Wanted to introduce you to a
friend of mine. This is Alana Kane.

1800
01:38:33,177 --> 01:38:34,270
- She's a volunteer.
- Oh, hey.

1801
01:38:34,312 --> 01:38:35,369
- Oh, volunteer. Wow.
- Hi. It's an honor

1802
01:38:35,411 --> 01:38:36,605
- to meet you.
- Wow, what a pleasure.

1803
01:38:36,647 --> 01:38:37,642
No, I'm honored to meet you.
Thank you for coming on board.

1804
01:38:37,684 --> 01:38:39,303
I have integrity.

1805
01:38:39,345 --> 01:38:40,480
Me too.

1806
01:38:40,522 --> 01:38:42,111
- I know.
- Honest.

1807
01:38:42,153 --> 01:38:43,486
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm. I'm that too.

1808
01:38:44,688 --> 01:38:49,483
This is public land which
the state bought for $34,000

1809
01:38:49,525 --> 01:38:51,654
when everyone knew
it was worth millions.

1810
01:38:51,696 --> 01:38:54,989
Sam Yorty and his cronies would
gladly destroy this beautiful

1811
01:38:55,031 --> 01:39:00,834
225,000 square acre mountain chain
for favors, payoffs, and ugly houses

1812
01:39:00,876 --> 01:39:03,001
that only their friends
can afford.

1813
01:39:03,043 --> 01:39:05,631
But it needn't be that way,
you see.

1814
01:39:05,673 --> 01:39:07,799
I understand it's crazy,

1815
01:39:07,841 --> 01:39:09,743
and everybody's talking
about a revolution,

1816
01:39:09,785 --> 01:39:12,013
but it doesn't have to be that.

1817
01:39:12,055 --> 01:39:15,347
All that we need are people
in positions of power

1818
01:39:15,389 --> 01:39:18,981
to remember to be who they were
when they were voted in.

1819
01:39:19,023 --> 01:39:20,814
And cut. That was great.

1820
01:39:20,856 --> 01:39:22,585
- I think that was the one.
- That felt really good.

1821
01:39:22,627 --> 01:39:23,853
- Yeah, I mean, that was terrific, Joel.
- It was great.

1822
01:39:23,895 --> 01:39:25,396
It did.

1823
01:39:38,372 --> 01:39:39,770
You ready? We good?

1824
01:39:39,812 --> 01:39:41,035
- Yeah.
- Good.

1825
01:39:42,314 --> 01:39:43,968
What would you say
to the people that think

1826
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:46,873
you're too young and don't
have enough experience?

1827
01:39:46,915 --> 01:39:48,880
I would say, "Thank you
very much for the compliment."

1828
01:39:48,922 --> 01:39:50,017
Sorry, sorry, just...

1829
01:39:50,059 --> 01:39:51,587
Can you say that again?
We didn't get that.

1830
01:39:53,529 --> 01:39:54,555
Really?

1831
01:39:54,597 --> 01:39:56,286
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1832
01:39:56,328 --> 01:39:58,383
Sorry, Councilman.

1833
01:39:58,425 --> 01:40:00,101
Everybody rolling? Good?

1834
01:40:01,438 --> 01:40:02,433
One more time.

1835
01:40:03,363 --> 01:40:05,130
<i>So, Councilman,</i>

1836
01:40:05,172 --> 01:40:06,893
what would you say
to the people that say,

1837
01:40:06,935 --> 01:40:09,566
"You're too young and don't
have enough experience"?

1838
01:40:09,608 --> 01:40:11,937
I would say, "Thank you
very much for the compliment."

1839
01:40:12,681 --> 01:40:13,939
The way I look at it...

1840
01:40:15,083 --> 01:40:16,406
I'm sorry.
Are you rolling? Did you...

1841
01:40:16,448 --> 01:40:18,578
- Are you rolling?
- I think we rolled out.

1842
01:40:20,023 --> 01:40:21,714
We're gonna need to take five.
I'm so sorry.

1843
01:40:21,756 --> 01:40:23,975
It's okay. It's okay.

1844
01:40:24,017 --> 01:40:25,919
So, Joel, don't forget,
tomorrow we got that

1845
01:40:25,961 --> 01:40:27,483
Toluca Lake neighborhood
council thing.

1846
01:40:27,525 --> 01:40:28,655
- Yeah.
- They'd love you there at 10,

1847
01:40:28,697 --> 01:40:29,716
if you can get there.

1848
01:40:29,758 --> 01:40:30,822
What's been going on
with the pinball?

1849
01:40:30,864 --> 01:40:31,892
Art's calling me...

1850
01:40:31,934 --> 01:40:32,992
Did you hear about
Judge Sachs?

1851
01:40:33,034 --> 01:40:34,094
- I did, yeah.
- It's over.

1852
01:40:34,136 --> 01:40:35,592
He lost five games to nothing.
So that's done.

1853
01:40:35,634 --> 01:40:37,590
- That's it?
- Pinball will be legal again

1854
01:40:37,632 --> 01:40:39,265
in LA for
the first time since...

1855
01:40:39,307 --> 01:40:41,100
- Wow
- It's been illegal since 1939.

1856
01:40:41,142 --> 01:40:43,002
- Can you believe it?
- I can believe it.

1857
01:40:43,044 --> 01:40:44,502
It's an outmoded
discriminatory law

1858
01:40:44,544 --> 01:40:46,507
in the first place so,
of course it took this long.

1859
01:40:46,549 --> 01:40:49,701
If I'm gonna call Art, I need to
know 100% that this thing is passing.

1860
01:40:49,743 --> 01:40:50,769
Oh, it's passing.
It's done.

1861
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:52,072
I talked to all my people
with the court.

1862
01:40:52,114 --> 01:40:53,177
It's over.

1863
01:40:53,219 --> 01:40:55,012
- Decision comes out tomorrow.
- Good.

1864
01:40:56,552 --> 01:40:59,278
Yes,
it's Gary Valentine.

1865
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:03,494
I started a new company, and, um,
I'm looking for some pinball machines.

1866
01:41:07,832 --> 01:41:08,829
No?

1867
01:41:09,163 --> 01:41:11,124
Okay.

1868
01:41:11,166 --> 01:41:13,600
Well, thank you for picking up my call.
Have a good day, Jimmy.

1869
01:41:18,311 --> 01:41:20,071
Are you doing what I think
you're doing?

1870
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:24,276
What do you think I'm doing?

1871
01:41:24,318 --> 01:41:26,484
Calling people
about pinball machines.

1872
01:41:27,921 --> 01:41:29,256
That's what I'm doing.

1873
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:32,358
Because?

1874
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:36,652
Because we could be the first
place open that has them.

1875
01:41:36,694 --> 01:41:39,530
Because we could start
"Fat Bernie's Pinball Palace."

1876
01:41:40,531 --> 01:41:42,121
You know, we spent the day
with a great man

1877
01:41:42,163 --> 01:41:44,823
who's really trying to make
a change on how this city runs,

1878
01:41:44,865 --> 01:41:46,396
and the only thing
you fucking heard was,

1879
01:41:46,438 --> 01:41:48,659
"Pinball machines
are about to be legal."

1880
01:41:48,701 --> 01:41:50,395
I heard other things, too.

1881
01:41:56,885 --> 01:42:00,180
Yello. Gary Valentine here.

1882
01:42:00,222 --> 01:42:02,408
Don, thank you for
calling me back so swiftly.

1883
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:03,684
"Swiftly"?

1884
01:42:03,726 --> 01:42:05,721
- Who are you?
- Yes.

1885
01:42:06,121 --> 01:42:08,015
Yes.

1886
01:42:08,057 --> 01:42:10,521
Is there a time that's convenient for
you, within your plans,

1887
01:42:10,563 --> 01:42:12,150
that I could come lay
some eyes on the equipment?

1888
01:42:12,192 --> 01:42:16,860
- Give me a fucking break, Gary.
- Great. Great.

1889
01:42:16,902 --> 01:42:20,591
I'm 10 minutes away, I'll be right over.
Thank you so much, Don.

1890
01:42:20,633 --> 01:42:21,827
I'm not driving you.

1891
01:42:21,869 --> 01:42:24,295
That's great news
'cause I can drive myself.

1892
01:42:24,337 --> 01:42:25,368
Hmm.

1893
01:42:25,410 --> 01:42:27,871
You're gonna go on your own?
Big man.

1894
01:42:27,913 --> 01:42:29,074
Yes, I am.

1895
01:42:33,656 --> 01:42:37,654
You smoke those cigarettes,
you're gonna throw up like a little bitch.

1896
01:42:41,158 --> 01:42:42,230
These cigarettes?

1897
01:42:42,930 --> 01:42:44,232
These ones right here?

1898
01:42:45,427 --> 01:42:47,235
"King size Mayburn."

1899
01:42:52,602 --> 01:42:54,242
You don't have
the balls.

1900
01:43:18,592 --> 01:43:20,631
I'm cooler than you.

1901
01:43:21,099 --> 01:43:23,189
Don't forget it.

1902
01:43:23,231 --> 01:43:25,857
I don't need you to tell me
whether I'm cool or not, old lady.

1903
01:43:25,899 --> 01:43:27,926
- What was that?
- I said "milady."

1904
01:43:27,968 --> 01:43:29,332
- I said "milady."
- What was that, then?

1905
01:43:29,374 --> 01:43:30,601
- What was that?
- "My lady."

1906
01:43:30,643 --> 01:43:33,545
I don't need you to tell me
whether I'm cool or not.

1907
01:43:34,942 --> 01:43:38,209
You're not cool,
and your breath smells.

1908
01:43:40,787 --> 01:43:41,784
Says you.

1909
01:43:42,450 --> 01:43:43,555
And you're old.

1910
01:43:45,484 --> 01:43:46,657
I'm old?

1911
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:49,956
I don't know what's cool?

1912
01:43:49,998 --> 01:43:52,333
Changing the world isn't cool?

1913
01:43:53,298 --> 01:43:54,693
Go ask Brian if you're cool.

1914
01:43:54,735 --> 01:43:55,732
I will.

1915
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:58,359
Who thinks you're cool, Gary?

1916
01:43:58,401 --> 01:44:00,460
Your waterbed fans?

1917
01:44:00,502 --> 01:44:02,475
Sue, Kirk, and Mark?

1918
01:44:03,344 --> 01:44:05,801
I hang out with
more people than that.

1919
01:44:05,843 --> 01:44:08,239
You don't even know
what's going on in the world.

1920
01:44:09,616 --> 01:44:11,805
You think that the world
revolves around Gary Valentine

1921
01:44:11,847 --> 01:44:13,473
and whatever stupid shit
you come up with.

1922
01:44:13,515 --> 01:44:14,610
- It does.
- It doesn't.

1923
01:44:14,652 --> 01:44:16,741
- It does.
- It doesn't. It's about more.

1924
01:44:16,783 --> 01:44:18,301
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

1925
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:19,232
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

1926
01:44:19,294 --> 01:44:20,552
Alana, you would still
be taking pictures

1927
01:44:20,594 --> 01:44:24,156
at my high school of children
if it wasn't for me.

1928
01:44:29,370 --> 01:44:31,834
You're talking
about pinball machines...

1929
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:34,342
I'm a politician.

1930
01:44:37,772 --> 01:44:39,710
I need to get my life together.

1931
01:44:43,216 --> 01:44:45,175
So, get it together.

1932
01:44:45,217 --> 01:44:46,681
Where are you going?

1933
01:44:46,723 --> 01:44:47,949
I'm going out.

1934
01:44:48,715 --> 01:44:50,556
Okay, I'll take you.

1935
01:44:53,058 --> 01:44:56,221
Come on, you wanna go see these
stupid pinball machines or what?

1936
01:44:58,057 --> 01:45:01,089
Gary, I'm gonna take you,
it's fine.

1937
01:45:01,131 --> 01:45:02,370
Gary.

1938
01:45:03,565 --> 01:45:05,856
What is your problem?

1939
01:45:05,898 --> 01:45:07,694
Don't you get in that car.

1940
01:45:07,736 --> 01:45:10,037
Don't you fucking
get in that car.

1941
01:45:11,237 --> 01:45:14,108
Gary fucking Valentine,
if you get in that...

1942
01:45:14,150 --> 01:45:16,206
I will never
speak to you ever again.

1943
01:45:26,322 --> 01:45:27,758
Just stop.

1944
01:45:55,752 --> 01:45:57,384
Good morning.
This is Alana Kane

1945
01:45:57,426 --> 01:45:58,713
calling from Councilman
Joel Wachs' office.

1946
01:45:58,755 --> 01:45:59,955
Am I catching you
at a good time?

1947
01:46:02,429 --> 01:46:03,922
I'm calling to ask
if you've heard

1948
01:46:03,964 --> 01:46:06,291
of the councilman's efforts to
reduce corruption in our local...

1949
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:09,470
Well, fuck you, then.

1950
01:46:14,068 --> 01:46:16,401
So, um, what's going on
with the analysis?

1951
01:46:16,443 --> 01:46:18,169
Oh, yeah,
that's Len Barton's thing.

1952
01:46:18,211 --> 01:46:20,097
They're small, but...

1953
01:46:20,139 --> 01:46:21,606
Good morning.
This is Alana Kane

1954
01:46:21,648 --> 01:46:22,836
calling from Councilman
Joel Wachs' office.

1955
01:46:22,878 --> 01:46:24,375
Am I catching you
at a good time?

1956
01:46:27,781 --> 01:46:28,873
Yes, I'm calling...

1957
01:46:28,915 --> 01:46:30,074
- Alana.
- Oh, I'm so sorry,

1958
01:46:30,116 --> 01:46:31,379
- I have to go.
- Oh, sorry about that.

1959
01:46:31,421 --> 01:46:32,615
- Um...
- Sorry.

1960
01:46:32,657 --> 01:46:33,786
Is it okay
if I tell you something?

1961
01:46:33,828 --> 01:46:34,911
Yeah.

1962
01:46:34,953 --> 01:46:37,721
Um, I've been known to be

1963
01:46:37,763 --> 01:46:41,120
a little forgetful,
absent-minded, and, um...

1964
01:46:41,162 --> 01:46:44,055
Look at me, I can't even
remember what I'm saying.

1965
01:46:44,097 --> 01:46:45,355
But, ever since
you've gotten here,

1966
01:46:45,397 --> 01:46:49,926
I've been very organized,
capable, and inspired.

1967
01:46:49,968 --> 01:46:53,105
So, thank you for that.

1968
01:46:53,147 --> 01:46:54,515
Thank you, Councilman.

1969
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:56,176
That's it.

1970
01:47:15,095 --> 01:47:16,626
Good morning.
This is Alana Kane

1971
01:47:16,668 --> 01:47:17,825
calling from
Joel Wachs' office.

1972
01:47:17,867 --> 01:47:19,540
Am I catching you
at a good time?

1973
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:21,901
I'm calling to ask
if you've heard

1974
01:47:21,943 --> 01:47:24,336
of the councilman's efforts to
reduce corruption in our local...

1975
01:47:26,345 --> 01:47:28,043
Well, fuck you, then.

1976
01:47:33,383 --> 01:47:36,250
Councilman Joel Wachs' office.
This is Alana. How may I help you?

1977
01:47:36,292 --> 01:47:38,513
- <i>Hey, it's me.</i>
- Oh, hey.

1978
01:47:38,555 --> 01:47:39,845
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1979
01:47:39,887 --> 01:47:42,318
Working. What are you doing?

1980
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:47,026
<i>Gary just came by and dropped off
a flier for his Pinball Palace.</i>

1981
01:47:47,068 --> 01:47:48,989
What did he say?

1982
01:47:49,031 --> 01:47:51,323
<i>Well, he wanted to see
if we would go.</i>

1983
01:47:51,365 --> 01:47:54,034
<i>And he wanted to make sure
you knew about it.</i>

1984
01:47:54,076 --> 01:47:55,466
What else did he say?

1985
01:47:56,134 --> 01:47:57,974
<i>Well, I think he misses you.</i>

1986
01:47:58,475 --> 01:48:00,174
He said that?

1987
01:48:00,216 --> 01:48:03,243
<i>No, but he looked really sad.</i>

1988
01:48:03,886 --> 01:48:05,080
<i>And sweet.</i>

1989
01:48:05,978 --> 01:48:07,819
<i>He asked about Brian.</i>

1990
01:48:09,484 --> 01:48:10,481
Hmm.

1991
01:48:11,593 --> 01:48:14,549
<i>You should just go to
his pinball store.</i>

1992
01:48:14,591 --> 01:48:16,013
I can't, I'm working.

1993
01:48:16,055 --> 01:48:18,225
<i>But they have free Pepsi.</i>

1994
01:48:18,893 --> 01:48:21,722
<i>And it's open till midnight.</i>

1995
01:48:21,764 --> 01:48:23,723
- Pepsi...
- <i>There's a band.</i>

1996
01:48:23,765 --> 01:48:25,192
Free Pepsi... Danielle,

1997
01:48:25,234 --> 01:48:27,559
I'm eliminating state
property tax for the elderly,

1998
01:48:27,601 --> 01:48:29,610
and saving the mountains,
and you're talking about free Pepsi.

1999
01:48:30,775 --> 01:48:33,581
Brian, do you see
that guy over there?

2000
01:48:36,612 --> 01:48:38,038
Number 12 guy?

2001
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:40,810
Yeah. I think
he's spying on us.

2002
01:48:40,852 --> 01:48:42,953
He keeps looking over here
like a creep.

2003
01:48:44,688 --> 01:48:46,253
He doesn't look weird to you?

2004
01:48:48,789 --> 01:48:50,256
He does a little.

2005
01:48:50,298 --> 01:48:52,422
He's been there all morning.

2006
01:48:52,464 --> 01:48:54,129
Go say something to him.

2007
01:48:54,795 --> 01:48:56,597
Just leave him.

2008
01:48:56,639 --> 01:48:58,598
If he stays there too long,
I'll say something.

2009
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:00,300
Yeah, you too. Thursday?

2010
01:49:05,443 --> 01:49:06,647
Can I help you?

2011
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:08,814
I don't know.

2012
01:49:09,647 --> 01:49:11,311
You're staring at our office.

2013
01:49:12,388 --> 01:49:15,445
Yeah, my eyes need
someplace to go.

2014
01:49:15,487 --> 01:49:16,822
What are you doing here?

2015
01:49:17,787 --> 01:49:18,876
I'm waiting for my friend.

2016
01:49:18,918 --> 01:49:20,122
Who's your friend?

2017
01:49:21,327 --> 01:49:22,663
No one you'd know.

2018
01:49:24,163 --> 01:49:25,690
Move it.

2019
01:49:25,732 --> 01:49:27,918
Away from our office.
Go down the street.

2020
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:29,591
Well...

2021
01:49:29,633 --> 01:49:31,798
This is a free country...

2022
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:35,907
so why don't you just go on
back to your little office

2023
01:49:37,644 --> 01:49:40,340
before I start
asking you questions.

2024
01:49:41,645 --> 01:49:43,145
Is there a problem?

2025
01:49:43,579 --> 01:49:45,015
Not from me.

2026
01:49:46,013 --> 01:49:47,808
Why don't you get out of here?

2027
01:49:47,850 --> 01:49:50,483
Hmm? Oh, yeah, I'm on my way.

2028
01:49:50,525 --> 01:49:52,352
- What was he saying?
- I don't know.

2029
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:01,658
- Fat Bernie's Pinball Palace.
- Tonight.

2030
01:50:01,700 --> 01:50:02,703

01:50:42,203 --> 01:50:45,075
Hi, Gary.
Please step up over here.

2053
01:50:47,746 --> 01:50:49,640
You have a dinner tonight, sir?

2054
01:50:50,252 --> 01:50:51,870
I hope so. I hope so.

2055
01:50:51,912 --> 01:50:53,278
That's great.

2056
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:54,986
Jacket. Mmm-hmm.

2057
01:51:23,946 --> 01:51:27,579
Hey, hey, buddy, buddy, buddy.

2058
01:51:27,621 --> 01:51:28,954
You're gonna break the machine.

2059
01:51:32,357 --> 01:51:33,354
Hey.

2060
01:51:33,922 --> 01:51:35,290
Hey, man, cool out.

2061
01:51:36,356 --> 01:51:38,888
Hey, can you hear me?
Buddy, stop!

2062
01:51:38,930 --> 01:51:41,296
Hey, I'm telling you
to fuck off, man.

You're out of here.

2065
01:52:01,282 --> 01:52:03,442
Come inside when
you're ready to be cool.

2066
01:52:03,484 --> 01:52:06,417
What is this? What is this?

2067
01:52:06,459 --> 01:52:07,520
Bikes to the side.

2068
01:52:07,562 --> 01:52:08,789
Jack, Matty, bikes to the side.

2069
01:52:08,831 --> 01:52:10,280
- They are on the side!
- Bikes to the side,

2070
01:52:10,322 --> 01:52:11,931
you're blocking the entrance!

2071
01:52:25,776 --> 01:52:26,946
Hand me that jacket.

2072
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:29,867
Here. Don't know whose it is.

2073
01:52:29,909 --> 01:52:30,917
Yeah.

2074
01:52:35,424 --> 01:52:36,681
I'm really glad you're here.

2075
01:52:38,359 --> 01:52:39,453
I told you that?

2076
01:52:40,824 --> 01:52:42,192
I'm glad I'm here, too.

2077
01:53:01,948 --> 01:53:04,175
Councilman Wachs' office.
Alana speaking.

2078
01:53:04,217 --> 01:53:06,511
<i>Oh, Alana,
I'm so glad I caught you.</i>

2079
01:53:06,553 --> 01:53:07,638
Oh, hi, Councilman.

2080
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:09,782
<i>Hi. I was wondering,
if you're not too busy,</i>

2081
01:53:09,824 --> 01:53:12,222
<i>if you could come meet me
for a drink?</i>

2082
01:53:13,953 --> 01:53:14,982
Me?

2083
01:53:15,024 --> 01:53:17,288
<i>Yes, you. It'll be nice, right?</i>

2084
01:53:17,330 --> 01:53:20,296
<i>We could have a quick drink,
I was thinking, Rive Gauche?</i>

2085
01:53:21,061 --> 01:53:22,659
That sounds nice.

2086
01:53:22,701 --> 01:53:25,094
<i>Just one small drink.</i>

2087
01:53:25,136 --> 01:53:27,126
<i>I don't wanna keep you
too long, but, um,</i>

2088
01:53:27,168 --> 01:53:29,797
<i>you should come straight away.</i>

2089
01:53:29,839 --> 01:53:30,977
<i>It's important.</i>

2090
01:53:31,875 --> 01:53:33,300
Right, straight away.

2091
01:53:33,342 --> 01:53:34,703
<i>Thanks so much, Alana.
See you soon.</i>

2092
01:53:34,745 --> 01:53:35,740
I'll see you soon.

2093
01:53:38,379 --> 01:53:39,986
The councilman
forgot his wallet.

2094
01:53:40,553 --> 01:53:42,054
- Again?
- Yeah.

2095
01:53:44,526 --> 01:53:46,190
He's never gonna win, is he?

2096
01:53:46,823 --> 01:53:47,928
What do you mean?

2097
01:53:48,697 --> 01:53:51,849
He's a mess.
Forgets everything.

2098
01:53:51,891 --> 01:53:54,786
If it's not his wallet,
it's his keys or his briefcase.

2099
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:57,062
I've gone to his house three
times to pick up paperwork.

2100
01:53:57,104 --> 01:53:59,170
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
he's not gonna win.

2101
01:54:01,675 --> 01:54:03,499
- I'll go with you.
- No.

2102
01:54:03,541 --> 01:54:04,538
No.

2103
01:54:05,543 --> 01:54:07,000
No.

2104
01:54:07,042 --> 01:54:08,949
Just finish locking up.

2105
01:54:09,745 --> 01:54:10,803
Okay.

2106
01:54:10,845 --> 01:54:11,842
Found it.

2107
01:54:15,556 --> 01:54:16,847
Guess I'll see you later?

2108
01:54:18,118 --> 01:54:19,124
Sure.

2109
01:54:19,957 --> 01:54:21,588
Wanna meet at Tarzana Bobs?

2110
01:54:22,289 --> 01:54:24,129
Tarzana Bobs. Sounds good.

2111
01:54:26,568 --> 01:54:28,562
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

2112
01:54:38,945 --> 01:54:40,740
Stop playing.
Stop playing. Leave.

2113
01:54:40,782 --> 01:54:43,501
- But I put my money...
- Leave. Leave.

2114
01:54:43,543 --> 01:54:46,085
- But, I...
- I own the place. Leave.

2115
01:55:00,502 --> 01:55:02,891
- Hello, Este.
- Hey.

2116
01:55:02,933 --> 01:55:05,424
- Hey, Gary.
- Hey.

2117
01:55:05,466 --> 01:55:07,962
This is really great.

2118
01:55:08,004 --> 01:55:10,233
Someone did their toes.

2119
01:55:10,275 --> 01:55:12,300
- I did do my toes.
- I like them. I like them.

2120
01:55:12,342 --> 01:55:13,402
- I like them. I like them.
- Thank you.

2121
01:55:13,444 --> 01:55:15,739
- Thank you for coming. Really.
- It's a big night.

2122
01:55:15,781 --> 01:55:17,101
You ladies look great.

2123
01:55:17,143 --> 01:55:18,282
Thank you.

2124
01:55:20,515 --> 01:55:22,649
Did you get a chance to talk
with Alana?

2125
01:55:27,025 --> 01:55:28,490
- Fuck!
- She gonna come?

2126
01:55:37,596 --> 01:55:39,039
You know where
she works, right?

2127
01:55:39,538 --> 01:55:40,535
Yeah.

2128
01:55:47,847 --> 01:55:49,610
Are you telling me to go? I...

2129
01:55:51,814 --> 01:55:52,811
Yeah.

2130
01:55:57,985 --> 01:55:58,982
Go.

2131
01:56:08,196 --> 01:56:09,630
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

2132
01:56:25,348 --> 01:56:26,846
No, I spoke to her,
and I said,

2133
01:56:26,888 --> 01:56:28,375
"No, it's not possible to do
that."

2134
01:56:28,417 --> 01:56:29,642
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah?

2135
01:56:29,684 --> 01:56:31,316
- And she was okay?
- Yeah, she was fine with it.

2136
01:56:50,105 --> 01:56:51,111
Alana!

2137
01:56:51,379 --> 01:56:52,376
Alana.

2138
01:56:55,915 --> 01:56:56,967
- Hi.
- Hi.

2139
01:56:57,009 --> 01:57:00,470
I wanna introduce you
to my old friend, Matthew.

2140
01:57:00,512 --> 01:57:01,574
Oh, nice to meet you.

2141
01:57:01,616 --> 01:57:02,749
- Nice to meet you.
- This is Alana.

2142
01:57:02,791 --> 01:57:04,213
She works with me
on the campaign.

2143
01:57:04,255 --> 01:57:05,685
She's been
such a terrific help.

2144
01:57:05,727 --> 01:57:06,744
- Mmm-hmm.
- I...

2145
01:57:06,786 --> 01:57:08,153
She helped make
those TV spots, actually.

2146
01:57:08,195 --> 01:57:11,024
Yes. I helped with
the "Integrity" billboard.

2147
01:57:11,066 --> 01:57:13,156
That and, like,
100 other things you've done.

2148
01:57:13,198 --> 01:57:15,095
Don't be shy.

2149
01:57:15,137 --> 01:57:17,260
Things come easily
when they matter so much.

2150
01:57:17,302 --> 01:57:19,599
It's funny, we were
just talking about that.

2151
01:57:19,641 --> 01:57:20,767
- Really?
- Yeah.

2152
01:57:20,809 --> 01:57:22,000
- Madame.
- Hi.

2153
01:57:22,042 --> 01:57:23,407
May I get
you something?

2154
01:57:24,711 --> 01:57:26,399
Uh... A martini.

2155
01:57:26,441 --> 01:57:28,540
Martini. Vodka or gin?

2156
01:57:28,582 --> 01:57:30,440
Vodka-gin.

2157
01:57:30,482 --> 01:57:32,774
Would you like
an olive or a lime with it?

2158
01:57:32,816 --> 01:57:34,009
Yes.

2159
01:57:34,051 --> 01:57:35,077
Yeah, madame.

2160
01:57:35,119 --> 01:57:37,107
Why am I even staying in this?

2161
01:57:37,149 --> 01:57:39,376
Did you have any
trouble, um, finding the place?

2162
01:57:39,418 --> 01:57:40,449
- Oh, no.
- No?

2163
01:57:40,491 --> 01:57:41,887
No, I come here all the time.

2164
01:57:42,563 --> 01:57:44,387
That's good.

2165
01:57:44,429 --> 01:57:46,421
And now, you're dragging
this poor girl into it.

2166
01:57:46,463 --> 01:57:48,456
Can we please
just enjoy dessert?

2167
01:57:48,498 --> 01:57:50,521
And settle down?
Everything's gonna be fine.

2168
01:57:50,563 --> 01:57:52,095
Alana's got her drink coming.

2169
01:57:53,467 --> 01:57:55,340
Is that your campaign slogan?

2170
01:57:56,074 --> 01:57:57,433
"Everything is gonna be fine

2171
01:57:57,475 --> 01:57:59,740
as long as no one finds out
who I really am."

2172
01:58:03,013 --> 01:58:05,610
I'm dealing with so many
things that you don't understand.

2173
01:58:05,652 --> 01:58:07,139
So tell me.

2174
01:58:07,181 --> 01:58:09,449
Do you have any idea how
uncomfortable I am all day long?

2175
01:58:09,491 --> 01:58:12,109
I can't understand.
No, because you don't tell me these things.

2176
01:58:12,151 --> 01:58:16,088
The one time, the one time
that I wanna feel comfortable,

2177
01:58:16,130 --> 01:58:17,748
you go out
and make me feel uncomfortable.

2178
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:19,657
I haven't done
anything to you, Joel.

2179
01:58:19,699 --> 01:58:21,456
Okay.

2180
01:58:21,498 --> 01:58:23,889
I didn't call this girl.
You called her.

2181
01:58:23,931 --> 01:58:25,229
Okay, but you're upset
that I called her.

2182
01:58:25,271 --> 01:58:27,161
Yes, I'm upset
because nothing is about me.

2183
01:58:27,203 --> 01:58:28,333
Nothing is about us.

2184
01:58:28,375 --> 01:58:29,599
Oh, yeah, I forget
who I'm dealing with here.

2185
01:58:29,641 --> 01:58:31,602
"I'm Matthew Marshall,
and, uh, it's always about me."

2186
01:58:31,644 --> 01:58:32,641
No.

2187
01:58:33,307 --> 01:58:34,379
No, no, Joel.

2188
01:58:35,513 --> 01:58:37,974
It's never about me,
and that's why I'm sad.

2189
01:58:38,016 --> 01:58:39,010
Well, look...

2190
01:58:40,153 --> 01:58:42,475
We're here,
we're having dinner.

2191
01:58:42,517 --> 01:58:44,280
You asked me to come to dinner.

2192
01:58:44,322 --> 01:58:46,610
I'm tired,
and I'm here at dinner.

2193
01:58:46,652 --> 01:58:48,327
What more do you want from me?

2194
01:58:49,654 --> 01:58:52,628
I want you to myself.

2195
01:58:54,126 --> 01:58:56,731
Well, that's just not
how the world works, is it?

2196
01:59:00,137 --> 01:59:01,868
I don't know.

2197
01:59:01,910 --> 01:59:03,738
Well, then you need to grow up.

2198
01:59:08,250 --> 01:59:10,973
There was a man hanging around
the office earlier,

2199
01:59:11,015 --> 01:59:12,714
and he's here now.

2200
01:59:14,855 --> 01:59:16,382
That's why I called.

2201
01:59:16,424 --> 01:59:18,843
Um, you see, I don't think it's
wise for my personal life

2202
01:59:18,885 --> 01:59:21,216
to distract from
what our first priority is.

2203
01:59:21,258 --> 01:59:23,223
What is our first priority?

2204
01:59:23,265 --> 01:59:25,949
Well, there's
the community, my campaign,

2205
01:59:25,991 --> 01:59:27,491
and everything
that I'm working towards.

2206
01:59:27,533 --> 01:59:29,489
Mmm-hmm. Yes, and that's that,
and this is dinner,

2207
01:59:29,531 --> 01:59:31,527
so what are we working towards?

2208
01:59:31,569 --> 01:59:34,163
So, Alana, you came
to meet me for a drink.

2209
01:59:34,205 --> 01:59:35,466
Um, you were running late,

2210
01:59:35,508 --> 01:59:37,300
and now, you're going
to be taking your boyfriend,

2211
01:59:37,342 --> 01:59:39,037
Matthew, home.

2212
01:59:43,109 --> 01:59:45,975
Is she gonna be taking
her boyfriend to his house,

2213
01:59:46,017 --> 01:59:47,037
or to your house?

2214
01:59:47,079 --> 01:59:48,312
Would you please
keep your voice down?

2215
01:59:48,354 --> 01:59:50,422
She's going to be taking you
to your house.

2216
01:59:52,124 --> 01:59:53,623
Are you gonna be coming there?

2217
01:59:57,199 --> 02:00:00,822
Can we just discuss this
at another time? Please.

2218
02:00:00,864 --> 02:00:02,428
Are you gonna come
to my house tonight, Joel?

2219
02:00:02,470 --> 02:00:04,898
Can we please just
discuss this at another time?

2220
02:00:06,239 --> 02:00:07,528
- Do you want me to...
- Can't...

2221
02:00:07,570 --> 02:00:08,735
Do you want me
to wait up for you?

2222
02:00:08,777 --> 02:00:10,442
No, Matthew.

2223
02:00:11,608 --> 02:00:13,478
Thank you both for coming.

2224
02:00:16,976 --> 02:00:19,544
Let's go
paint the town red.

2225
02:00:19,586 --> 02:00:22,487
- So nice of you guys to...
- And black and blue.

2226
02:00:46,842 --> 02:00:49,008
Thank you, Alana.
You're very sweet.

2227
02:00:59,685 --> 02:01:01,328
Do you have a boyfriend?

2228
02:01:03,962 --> 02:01:05,156
Yes and no.

2229
02:01:06,526 --> 02:01:07,664
I don't know.

2230
02:01:11,630 --> 02:01:12,966
Is he a shit?

2231
02:01:14,700 --> 02:01:17,597
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

2232
02:01:17,639 --> 02:01:19,643
They're all shits, aren't they?

2233
02:01:24,476 --> 02:01:25,649
Aw...

2234
02:01:33,389 --> 02:01:35,153
Thank you, sweetheart.

2235
02:01:39,034 --> 02:01:41,225
You have
a very powerful feeling.

2236
02:01:44,906 --> 02:01:46,373
Thank you, Matthew.

2237
02:03:24,162 --> 02:03:26,127
You're very cool.
What do you play?

2238
02:03:26,169 --> 02:03:27,262
Guitar.

2239
02:03:27,304 --> 02:03:28,461
- Hey.
- Me, too.

2240
02:03:28,503 --> 02:03:29,509
Where's Gary?

2241
02:03:29,977 --> 02:03:31,104
Are you okay?

2242
02:03:31,605 --> 02:03:32,677
Where's Gary?

2243
02:03:33,607 --> 02:03:34,613
He left.

2244
02:03:35,279 --> 02:03:36,305
Where'd he go?

2245
02:03:36,347 --> 02:03:37,341
I don't know.

2246
02:03:38,777 --> 02:03:43,448
Pop. Pop. Pop.

2247
02:03:52,157 --> 02:03:53,992
Miss Alana.
Good evening.

2248
02:03:54,034 --> 02:03:55,084
Is Gary here?

2249
02:03:55,126 --> 02:03:57,459
No, Gary didn't
come in tonight.

2250
02:03:57,501 --> 02:03:58,965
- You haven't seen him?
- No.

2251
02:03:59,007 --> 02:04:00,199
Do you need some help?

2252
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:02,201
No, thank you, Henri.

2253
02:05:15,616 --> 02:05:18,948
Oh, my God.

2254
02:05:29,225 --> 02:05:33,592
Everyone, everyone!
May I have your attention, please?

2255
02:05:33,634 --> 02:05:36,735
Let me introduce to you,
Mrs. Alana Valentine.

2256
02:05:40,567 --> 02:05:41,564
Idiot.

2257
02:05:59,487 --> 02:06:00,484
Hi.

2258
02:06:03,656 --> 02:06:04,730
Hi.

2259
02:06:11,501 --> 02:06:12,969
I love you, Gary.
