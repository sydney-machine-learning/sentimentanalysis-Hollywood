2
00:01:19,723 --> 00:01:20,991
That's the cleanup crew

3
00:01:21,024 --> 00:01:22,993
up on the track,
and that's a lot of racers

4
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:25,996
involved there, folks.

5
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:42,312
Jack, you realize
you got this in the bag, right?

6
00:01:42,345 --> 00:01:44,781
Season's wrapped up, man.
Doesn't matter where you place.

7
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,249
I'm telling you,
I got intermittent miss.

8
00:01:46,283 --> 00:01:47,317
- Last two laps.
- On it!

9
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,486
Get those plug wires!

10
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,687
Jakob! Now.

11
00:01:51,955 --> 00:01:52,923
Hey, Pop.

12
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:54,391
Tell me what you see, Dom.

13
00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:55,825
Got an oil spill
going into turn two.

14
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:57,327
Bell's driving safe.

15
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,329
Corbin's got a sponsor in
the stands, so he's pushing it.

16
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:00,764
Talking about me?

17
00:02:00,797 --> 00:02:02,165
You got a real problem
with car 23.

18
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:04,901
- Linder.
- About to whip your ass, Toretto!

19
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:06,803
- Settle down, pretty boy!
- That's right.

20
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:08,506
- Shut up!
- Yeah, you. You want to tell your driver

21
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,040
- he's gonna get somebody hurt?
- What'd you say?

22
00:02:10,073 --> 00:02:11,341
- Hey! Leave it!
- Go home! You suck!

23
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:12,842
He's just pissed I got that spot

24
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:14,244
in the Busch Series
next season, not him.

25
00:02:14,277 --> 00:02:17,214
Life's got no shortage of guys
like Kenny Linder.

26
00:02:17,247 --> 00:02:18,748
You're good!

27
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:23,887
It's not about being
the stronger man, Dom.

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,122
It's about being the bigger one.

29
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:56,886
I swear to God, this guy.

30
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,062
Pop, turn two, turn two!

31
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:12,769
Got it. I'm walking him in.

32
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:18,942
Shit!

33
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:30,186
Tell me what you see, Dom.

34
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:38,061
He's gonna come at you for that.

35
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:46,169
Get ready on your left.

36
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:53,002
Three-eighths ratchet.

37
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,275
Three-eighths driver.

38
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:02,212
Six-inch extension.

39
00:05:06,282 --> 00:05:07,317
Are you sure?

40
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:21,398
Remember what your daddy
told you.

41
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:23,667
Be precise in life.

42
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:25,402
It can make all the difference.

43
00:05:25,435 --> 00:05:27,203
Now, watch this.

44
00:05:28,338 --> 00:05:30,407
- See how it's working now?
- Mm-hmm.

45
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,342
And you see what's happening?

46
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:35,011
It's turning the screw.

47
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:37,414
You're right.

48
00:05:37,447 --> 00:05:39,149
Water heater's out again.

49
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:42,185
It's the price we pay
for peace and quiet.

50
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:45,422
Want to come and give us a hand?

51
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,961
Are you expecting someone?

52
00:05:54,197 --> 00:05:55,699
Brian, remember
what we practiced.

53
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:23,126
Yo, yo!

54
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:27,230
We come in peace.
We come in peace!

55
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:32,202
It's me!

56
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:34,404
Roman?
Maybe you don't recognize me

57
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,607
'cause I've been tanning
all week, bro.

58
00:06:39,477 --> 00:06:42,546
B, come out, son.

59
00:06:50,186 --> 00:06:52,422
What you gonna do
with that thing, man?

60
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,625
What, you out here trying
to kill elephants or something?

61
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:56,359
We would've called first.

62
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:59,395
Except you actually need phones
in order to get phone calls.

63
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:00,396
You know that, right?

64
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,465
- Little B!
- Wow, you're so big.

65
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,067
- Hi. - Wow.
- Hi.

66
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,103
Now, I know you don't carpool.

67
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:09,673
So what's up?

68
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:11,274
Mayday! Mayday!

69
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:14,377
My plane is under attack
by a rogue agent!

70
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:19,750
We're being boarded. I've got
dangerous cargo on board.

71
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:21,384
I need you to assemble the team.

72
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,487
...still alive. I'll explain...

73
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:28,526
It's an SOS transmission
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

74
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,794
It came through with
a mess of encrypted data,

75
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:32,496
most of which
I'm still trying to crack.

76
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,430
- Did anybody else get this?
- Well, that's the thing.

77
00:07:34,464 --> 00:07:36,734
He sent it only to us.

78
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:39,202
Why just us?

79
00:07:47,578 --> 00:07:48,679
He caught Cipher.

80
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:50,548
But there was a midair attack,

81
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:52,215
and she was extracted.

82
00:07:52,248 --> 00:07:55,218
It seems his plane crashed
somewhere here,

83
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:57,453
over the northwest region
of Montequinto.

84
00:07:57,488 --> 00:08:00,189
If Mr. Nobody survived,
we need to find him.

85
00:08:00,223 --> 00:08:01,792
But the whole area's sealed off.

86
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:03,561
Isolationist, run by military.

87
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:05,529
We're not on call anymore.

88
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,167
Wait, wait.

89
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,837
Dom, this is Cipher.

90
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:17,407
The woman who killed
the mother of your child.

91
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:22,580
Things change.

92
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:30,888
Listen, we're wheels up
at 8:00 a.m.,

93
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:33,557
if you change your mind.

94
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:35,291
Thank you.

95
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:40,363
<i>Daddy,
do you know where God is?</i>

96
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:42,600
- Where is God?
- In your heart.

97
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:45,168
He's in your heart, too.

98
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:46,737
And you know something?

99
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,506
I'll always be in your heart.

100
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,107
Hey, little guy.

101
00:08:51,642 --> 00:08:53,242
I have a gift for you.

102
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:56,245
Your father gave this to me.

103
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,183
And now I'm gonna
give it to you.

104
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:03,754
It's very special.

105
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:05,455
Take care of it.

106
00:09:21,672 --> 00:09:23,473
Good night.

107
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:36,419
This isn't who we are.

108
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:43,192
Brian and Mia got out of the
game when they became parents.

109
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:46,530
We're not them.

110
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:29,740
...under
attack by a rogue agent!

111
00:10:29,773 --> 00:10:33,309
We're being boarded. I've got
dangerous cargo on board.

112
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:34,578
...assemble the team.

113
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:36,680
...still alive. I'll explain...

114
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:40,216
...alive. I'll explain...

115
00:11:31,034 --> 00:11:32,803
Coming up on the signal,
two miles.

116
00:11:32,836 --> 00:11:35,639
It's deep in the militarized
zone of Montequinto.

117
00:11:35,672 --> 00:11:37,908
- I hope everyone's ready.
- Ready?

118
00:11:37,941 --> 00:11:39,543
Y'all want to make jokes
about me

119
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:41,444
not making practical decisions?

120
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:43,379
This is as prepared as it gets.

121
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,082
We all see you, man.

122
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:47,918
Nobody thinks you're
compensating for anything.

123
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,395
- I'll take point.
- Careful.

124
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,799
Careful's when you get hurt.

125
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:16,513
Right now, we have

126
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:18,347
a ten-minute window
between patrols.

127
00:12:18,381 --> 00:12:20,083
Mr. Nobody's signal is close,

128
00:12:20,117 --> 00:12:22,519
but we've got
to move quickly, guys.

129
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:24,822
We do not want to cross paths
with the military here.

130
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:52,916
- It's inside.
- Cover us.

131
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,705
The source of the SOS signal is
coming from inside this thing.

132
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:19,710
Somebody wanted in.

133
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,746
Plane must have gone down
before they could cut through.

134
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:25,682
Or it was sent down
on purpose to stop 'em.

135
00:13:25,716 --> 00:13:27,751
Yeah, well, their mistake
was trying to cut into it.

136
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:30,654
But just give me a minute.
I can get in.

137
00:13:32,956 --> 00:13:34,091
Dom.

138
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:36,093
There's not a soul in sight.

139
00:13:36,126 --> 00:13:38,427
No sign of Mr. Nobody.

140
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:40,463
Got it.

141
00:13:47,137 --> 00:13:48,705
What the hell is this?

142
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:51,808
Whatever it is, Mr. Nobody
wanted us to find it.

143
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:53,911
How's that work...

144
00:13:53,944 --> 00:13:55,779
Go!

145
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:35,953
What?!
You don't know who I am?!

146
00:14:35,986 --> 00:14:37,654
You think I'm scared?!

147
00:16:02,205 --> 00:16:04,741
Roman, where the hell are you?!

148
00:16:10,347 --> 00:16:14,117
Who's compensating now, Tej?!

149
00:16:37,274 --> 00:16:39,943
<i>"Peligro minas."</i>
What does that mean?

150
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:41,645
Tej, how fast we got to go
to clear 'em?

151
00:16:41,678 --> 00:16:42,946
Please don't tell me
you're thinking

152
00:16:42,979 --> 00:16:44,314
- what I think you're thinking.
- Why?

153
00:16:44,347 --> 00:16:45,949
What does <i>"peligro minas"</i> mean?

154
00:16:45,982 --> 00:16:48,251
- Tej, how fast?
- I don't know, man.

155
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:49,653
Somebody answer me!

156
00:16:49,686 --> 00:16:51,088
What does <i>"peligro minas"</i> mean?

157
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:52,322
<i>"Peligro minas"</i> means

158
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:54,691
- "danger, land mines"!
- What?!

159
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,962
How fast, Tej?

160
00:16:58,995 --> 00:17:00,697
Assuming a 50-foot blast radius

161
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,800
and a-a half a second trigger
delay, I'd say about 80.

162
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:04,634
I can't!

163
00:17:04,668 --> 00:17:06,970
My speedometer
only goes up to 70.

164
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:09,272
- What do I do?!
- You put your foot to that floor,

165
00:17:09,306 --> 00:17:10,273
and you pray!

166
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,956
Get to that palm plantation,
and then we're clear.

167
00:18:40,063 --> 00:18:41,164
Whoa!

168
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,244
Whoa!

169
00:18:57,147 --> 00:18:58,315
Roman, you good?

170
00:19:02,118 --> 00:19:04,955
My ass is <i>en fuego!</i>

171
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:15,999
Tej! Wait! Land mine!

172
00:20:30,874 --> 00:20:33,243
How in the hell
are you not dead?

173
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:45,955
Wait, okay, I think
I found us another way out.

174
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:48,592
Two miles to what looks like
a bridge across the border.

175
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:51,928
Good. The sooner we get
out of here, the better.

176
00:20:54,898 --> 00:20:56,366
Letty, on the right.

177
00:21:33,704 --> 00:21:36,272
The device.

178
00:21:57,293 --> 00:21:58,361
Get in.

179
00:22:18,214 --> 00:22:21,485
That was Jakob back there,
wasn't it?

180
00:22:52,015 --> 00:22:54,350
Always check your mirrors,
bitches!

181
00:22:55,351 --> 00:22:56,152
Oh, hell no.

182
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:57,688
Are we supposed to drive
across that?

183
00:22:57,721 --> 00:23:00,356
Well, I said
it looked like a bridge.

184
00:23:12,803 --> 00:23:16,105
Oh, my God!

185
00:23:35,325 --> 00:23:37,126
The military's not giving up.

186
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,596
We got to get past the border.

187
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:37,186
Where's the bridge?

188
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:43,393
No. No, no.

189
00:24:43,426 --> 00:24:44,662
Dom.

190
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,165
Well, that was new.

191
00:25:41,317 --> 00:25:43,487
Look, we're in the clear.

192
00:25:44,588 --> 00:25:46,255
But this thing is a mess.

193
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:48,358
The headlines out there?

194
00:25:48,391 --> 00:25:51,629
Secret spy plane crashes
in a hostile country?

195
00:25:51,662 --> 00:25:55,431
Followed by some kind of
covert ops firefight?

196
00:25:55,465 --> 00:25:58,201
I'll get you where you need...

197
00:25:58,234 --> 00:26:00,436
and then I'm gonna need
to back off.

198
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:07,478
I appreciate the favor.

199
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:13,550
I got to stop doing
so many favors.

200
00:26:16,252 --> 00:26:18,889
What we doing, Ramsey?

201
00:26:18,922 --> 00:26:20,289
Like, where are we going?

202
00:26:20,323 --> 00:26:23,226
I-I was able to decrypt the data

203
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:24,795
that came through
with Mr. Nobody's SOS,

204
00:26:24,828 --> 00:26:28,732
and I found GPS coordinates,
definitely included on purpose.

205
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:33,369
You knew about Jakob?

206
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,907
Question: Who is Jakob?

207
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,810
Jakob is...

208
00:26:39,843 --> 00:26:41,612
or was Dom's brother.

209
00:26:44,782 --> 00:26:46,817
Oh, my-my bad.

210
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,787
I'm sorry. I'm just processing.

211
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,922
Brother?

212
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:53,691
You got a brother?

213
00:26:53,724 --> 00:26:57,427
Who also happens to be
some kind of super spy

214
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,697
with his own private army,

215
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,398
who drives literally like
a bat out of hell,

216
00:27:02,432 --> 00:27:04,735
who preplanned an aerial jump

217
00:27:04,768 --> 00:27:07,236
and landed at the bottom
of an airplane?

218
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,305
Who does that?

219
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:12,743
Who does that? A Toretto.

220
00:27:13,744 --> 00:27:17,380
That's my dad! That's my dad!

221
00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:19,650
He's gone! He's gone!

222
00:27:19,683 --> 00:27:21,417
We got to get him out of there.

223
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:23,787
We got to get him out of there!
That's my dad!

224
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:28,992
That's my dad! That's my dad!

225
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:30,761
That's my dad!

226
00:27:30,794 --> 00:27:33,262
Get him out of there!

227
00:27:33,296 --> 00:27:34,765
That's my dad!

228
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:44,340
There's a couple of release
forms we've got to sign.

229
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:46,577
Few clearances.

230
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,349
Everything else is down there
around the corner.

231
00:28:18,575 --> 00:28:20,343
Hey.

232
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:23,412
Nobody's supposed to be
around here.

233
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:25,916
You Toretto's other son?

234
00:28:25,949 --> 00:28:27,918
You're the useless one, right?

235
00:28:33,924 --> 00:28:35,793
What is that?

236
00:28:35,826 --> 00:28:39,062
Get out of here. Go.

237
00:28:39,096 --> 00:28:41,430
So a man can't pay
his last respects?

238
00:28:41,464 --> 00:28:42,933
That's what that is?

239
00:28:42,966 --> 00:28:44,034
No.

240
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:45,468
No, not you.

241
00:28:45,502 --> 00:28:46,837
You're the one that killed him.

242
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,639
No, racing killed him.

243
00:28:48,672 --> 00:28:50,607
Look, he knew that I was gonna
pit him into the wall.

244
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:51,708
He knew that.

245
00:28:51,742 --> 00:28:53,544
Now, I don't know if
he dropped gear. I don't know.

246
00:28:53,577 --> 00:28:55,746
I swear... I swear to God,

247
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:57,981
- if you don't get out of here...
- What? What?

248
00:28:58,015 --> 00:28:59,483
Go find Buddy.

249
00:28:59,516 --> 00:29:01,350
Now!

250
00:29:05,856 --> 00:29:09,626
All right, well,
now we got the golden boy.

251
00:29:12,996 --> 00:29:14,731
Leave.

252
00:29:15,566 --> 00:29:17,400
You here to make threats, too?

253
00:29:17,433 --> 00:29:20,369
"Leave" is a simple word.

254
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:22,573
Man, what is it
with you Torettos

255
00:29:22,606 --> 00:29:24,775
where you're all the heroes
in your own stories?

256
00:29:24,808 --> 00:29:27,578
Look, I'm gonna
tell you a secret.

257
00:29:27,611 --> 00:29:30,914
You, your dad, me...
we're all stuck,

258
00:29:30,948 --> 00:29:34,450
going round and round
in the same shitty circle.

259
00:29:34,484 --> 00:29:36,687
And we ain't never getting out.

260
00:29:38,488 --> 00:29:40,891
You ain't half the man
my dad was.

261
00:29:42,192 --> 00:29:44,862
- At least I'm alive, asshole.
- What did you say?

262
00:29:44,895 --> 00:29:46,797
Get off me!

263
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,131
Dom! Dom!

264
00:29:48,165 --> 00:29:50,433
Dom!

265
00:29:50,466 --> 00:29:52,401
Dom, no! Dom!

266
00:29:52,435 --> 00:29:53,971
No, man!

267
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:12,956
In here.

268
00:30:36,914 --> 00:30:38,649
Jakob.

269
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:40,717
I simply cannot believe that
magnet trick actually worked.

270
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:43,654
It looked so damn cool.
Look at this here.

271
00:30:43,687 --> 00:30:45,122
I got this off the cockpit feed.

272
00:30:45,155 --> 00:30:47,190
Oh, I love being rich.

273
00:30:47,224 --> 00:30:49,458
It was sloppy. He almost had me.

274
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:52,629
- She say anything?
- Nope. Nada.

275
00:30:52,663 --> 00:30:55,532
You know, I look at her
and I feel creeped out.

276
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:58,168
And sort of turned on
at the same time.

277
00:30:58,201 --> 00:31:00,203
Is that weird?

278
00:31:03,106 --> 00:31:04,841
Nice operation.

279
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,611
You snatched me off
Mr. Nobody's plane midair

280
00:31:07,644 --> 00:31:09,846
without a scratch,
and you took him down.

281
00:31:10,847 --> 00:31:12,516
Money well spent.

282
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:16,820
- Do you know who I am?
- I know who you are.

283
00:31:16,853 --> 00:31:17,955
Do you?

284
00:31:20,257 --> 00:31:23,459
East L.A. is a tough enough
place to grow up.

285
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:29,800
But it was your brother's shadow
that turned you into this.

286
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:30,867
Isn't it?

287
00:31:33,303 --> 00:31:38,041
So your whole life, you pushed
yourself to be faster than Dom.

288
00:31:38,075 --> 00:31:40,010
Smarter than Dom.

289
00:31:41,078 --> 00:31:43,613
Stronger than Dom.

290
00:31:44,881 --> 00:31:50,620
Tell me, do you hate him enough
that it keeps you up at night?

291
00:31:52,155 --> 00:31:53,991
Still?

292
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:58,762
All these years later?

293
00:32:02,232 --> 00:32:03,834
I should've just hired you

294
00:32:03,867 --> 00:32:06,670
instead of coercing your
brother a couple of years back.

295
00:32:06,703 --> 00:32:08,205
I don't work
for the competition.

296
00:32:08,238 --> 00:32:09,806
That's cute.

297
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,308
You thinking
you're the competition.

298
00:32:11,341 --> 00:32:13,844
Says the woman in the box.

299
00:32:17,047 --> 00:32:18,315
Look familiar?

300
00:32:18,348 --> 00:32:19,950
The other half's hidden

301
00:32:19,983 --> 00:32:23,153
in one of the agency's
thousands of vaults.

302
00:32:23,186 --> 00:32:25,856
I need you to find out
which one.

303
00:32:25,889 --> 00:32:29,626
We secured the master drive here
from Mr. Nobody's plane.

304
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:31,261
The rest of the hardware
is a bit dated.

305
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:33,163
Pre-Internet.

306
00:32:33,196 --> 00:32:34,631
To make sure you don't go

307
00:32:34,664 --> 00:32:36,867
hack into anything
we don't want you to.

308
00:32:38,635 --> 00:32:41,605
Say you get what you're after.

309
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:43,673
A weapon so dangerous
it shouldn't exist

310
00:32:43,707 --> 00:32:44,741
for another half century.

311
00:32:44,775 --> 00:32:46,109
What would you do with it?

312
00:32:46,143 --> 00:32:48,278
Launch some global attack?

313
00:32:48,311 --> 00:32:50,680
Sell it to the highest bidder?

314
00:32:50,714 --> 00:32:53,917
Or maybe you see yourself

315
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,753
as a necessary shock
to the system.

316
00:32:56,787 --> 00:32:59,823
I bet all you ever wanted
was a hug.

317
00:32:59,856 --> 00:33:02,959
You read my psych eval.
Good for you.

318
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:06,329
I read your second-grade
report card.

319
00:33:06,363 --> 00:33:08,732
That's what I do.

320
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,644
Your chin... it's distinctive.

321
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:24,948
I know the Torettos have
quite the mixed bloodlines,

322
00:33:24,981 --> 00:33:28,185
but I never detected
a Nordic strain.

323
00:33:37,227 --> 00:33:41,698
Finding the two halves of
Project Aries is the easy part.

324
00:33:41,731 --> 00:33:43,767
Add in your brother Dom
to the mix?

325
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,136
You don't have a chance.

326
00:33:47,137 --> 00:33:49,606
Plans are in motion.

327
00:33:53,143 --> 00:33:55,112
Qasar Khan.

328
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:57,981
What?

329
00:33:58,782 --> 00:34:00,750
Genghis Khan's little brother.

330
00:34:04,287 --> 00:34:05,989
Nobody's heard of him either.

331
00:34:31,314 --> 00:34:33,450
Talk about off the grid.

332
00:34:33,484 --> 00:34:35,852
I don't think they had grids

333
00:34:35,886 --> 00:34:37,821
when this place was built.

334
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:40,857
If a Ninja Turtle pop out on me,

335
00:34:40,891 --> 00:34:42,859
tell you right now, I'm out.

336
00:34:42,893 --> 00:34:45,762
No way this place was
sanctioned by the agency.

337
00:34:45,795 --> 00:34:48,999
This was definitely
Mr. Nobody's secret hideout.

338
00:34:57,073 --> 00:34:58,742
What now, Dom?

339
00:35:00,511 --> 00:35:02,913
Whoever Jakob has become...

340
00:35:05,081 --> 00:35:07,217
...and whatever he's up to...

341
00:35:11,755 --> 00:35:14,191
...it's on me.

342
00:35:14,224 --> 00:35:15,258
And me alone.

343
00:35:15,292 --> 00:35:16,793
Nah.

344
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:21,064
Whatever's on you, it's on us.

345
00:35:21,097 --> 00:35:22,899
Let's get to work.

346
00:35:39,182 --> 00:35:43,286
Y'all ever thought about how
many wild missions we been on?

347
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,422
How we somehow...

348
00:35:45,455 --> 00:35:47,824
- always survive?
- Yeah.

349
00:35:47,857 --> 00:35:50,093
- So far, so good, I guess.
- It's just luck.

350
00:35:50,126 --> 00:35:52,262
No, no, no, see,
y'all not listening.

351
00:35:52,295 --> 00:35:54,364
Think about this.

352
00:35:54,397 --> 00:35:57,300
We've now been
on insane missions

353
00:35:57,334 --> 00:36:01,371
around the world,
doing what most would say is

354
00:36:01,404 --> 00:36:02,973
damn near impossible.

355
00:36:03,006 --> 00:36:05,875
And I ain't got one single scar
to show for it?

356
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:08,178
I mean, look at my jacket.

357
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:13,817
Those are bullet holes from
14 dudes trying to take my head

358
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,151
clean off its shoulders.

359
00:36:15,185 --> 00:36:18,255
We've taken out
cars, trains, tanks.

360
00:36:18,288 --> 00:36:20,390
I'm not gonna even
mention the submarine.

361
00:36:20,423 --> 00:36:23,393
And yet we're still here.

362
00:36:23,426 --> 00:36:24,861
Exactly.

363
00:36:24,894 --> 00:36:26,396
Ramsey, what happens
when you test a theory

364
00:36:26,429 --> 00:36:29,866
over and over again only
to come to the same result?

365
00:36:29,899 --> 00:36:31,134
A hypothesis becomes fact.

366
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:32,869
But you're not actually
suggesting that...

367
00:36:32,902 --> 00:36:34,871
I don't know,
but when the improbable happens

368
00:36:34,904 --> 00:36:38,008
again and again,
that's more than luck.

369
00:36:38,908 --> 00:36:40,910
Maybe we're not so normal.

370
00:36:40,944 --> 00:36:42,879
That's what I'm saying.

371
00:36:42,912 --> 00:36:44,447
We are not normal.

372
00:36:44,482 --> 00:36:47,083
Okay, um...

373
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:48,952
just to clarify,

374
00:36:48,985 --> 00:36:51,888
are you two maybe suggesting
that we're what,

375
00:36:51,921 --> 00:36:53,823
invincible?

376
00:36:54,457 --> 00:36:57,093
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

377
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:01,197
Or maybe...

378
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:02,566
you're just a dumbass.

379
00:37:06,403 --> 00:37:10,307
Take your dumbass jacket
with you, man.

380
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:19,983
Pretty impressive driving
out there.

381
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:23,253
You miss the old life.

382
00:37:25,422 --> 00:37:26,423
Do you?

383
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,293
Every day.

384
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:33,830
Guys.

385
00:37:34,598 --> 00:37:37,367
We got a little company.

386
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:40,036
Think you know this person.

387
00:37:41,104 --> 00:37:44,608
- It's so good to see you.
- I missed you.

388
00:37:44,642 --> 00:37:46,544
Thank you.

389
00:37:46,577 --> 00:37:48,378
Of course.

390
00:37:51,582 --> 00:37:53,983
You should've told me.

391
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:57,387
She deserved to know.

392
00:37:58,388 --> 00:38:01,424
Jakob's my brother, too.
I need to be here.

393
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:05,862
You get involved here, you put
everything you have at risk.

394
00:38:07,397 --> 00:38:10,066
Your kids and the whole world
that you built.

395
00:38:10,701 --> 00:38:13,002
We're all risking something.

396
00:38:14,471 --> 00:38:16,973
Dom, listen to me.

397
00:38:17,006 --> 00:38:21,244
My kids and yours are
in the safest hands possible.

398
00:38:21,277 --> 00:38:22,345
With Brian.

399
00:38:23,714 --> 00:38:26,116
Our world's grown, Dom.

400
00:38:27,283 --> 00:38:29,185
I got this one.

401
00:38:36,126 --> 00:38:38,128
The firewall on this old thing

402
00:38:38,161 --> 00:38:39,329
is actually pretty good.

403
00:38:39,362 --> 00:38:42,332
But, you know, port scan,
UDP message peek,

404
00:38:42,365 --> 00:38:44,300
pop to root shell, and...

405
00:38:46,169 --> 00:38:48,572
...say hello to Project Aries.

406
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:50,073
What is it?

407
00:38:50,106 --> 00:38:51,709
It's what we got from
Mr. Nobody's plane.

408
00:38:51,742 --> 00:38:54,077
Or at least part of it.

409
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,045
Aries was designed
to override and assimilate

410
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,715
anything that runs on code.

411
00:38:57,748 --> 00:38:59,315
Any computer anywhere.

412
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:01,451
If it operates on zeros
and ones, it's vulnerable.

413
00:39:01,485 --> 00:39:04,622
If you take Aries
and upload it to a satellite,

414
00:39:04,655 --> 00:39:07,023
it'll spread like a virus.

415
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:09,292
Then it'll be a matter of time
before someone can control

416
00:39:09,325 --> 00:39:12,228
any weapon system...
traditional, nuclear,

417
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:13,631
stuff we haven't even seen yet...

418
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:16,232
and just point it
wherever they want.

419
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:21,739
Jakob reboots the world order
within minutes.

420
00:39:21,772 --> 00:39:24,608
Ares is the god of war, right?

421
00:39:24,642 --> 00:39:26,610
If Jakob gets his hands on this,

422
00:39:26,644 --> 00:39:29,747
he'll be the god
of damn near everything.

423
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,715
Because of how dangerous it was,

424
00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:33,216
the Aries prototype
was recovered

425
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:35,285
and split into two halves
by Mr. Nobody.

426
00:39:35,318 --> 00:39:38,988
Both of which are worthless
without the activation key.

427
00:39:39,022 --> 00:39:41,224
Jakob now has one of the pieces.

428
00:39:41,257 --> 00:39:43,393
He'll be going after
the other half next.

429
00:39:43,426 --> 00:39:47,063
As for the key, it's...
it's vanished.

430
00:39:47,096 --> 00:39:48,198
So we find it.

431
00:39:48,231 --> 00:39:50,033
If we're gonna beat Jakob to it,

432
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:51,367
we're gonna have to split up.

433
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:53,504
Roman, Tej,
I know a couple of guys

434
00:39:53,537 --> 00:39:56,540
operating out of Germany that
could get us anything we need.

435
00:39:56,574 --> 00:39:58,074
I'm on it.

436
00:39:58,107 --> 00:39:59,409
Wait, there's one more thing.

437
00:39:59,442 --> 00:40:01,010
Mr. Nobody's transmission

438
00:40:01,044 --> 00:40:03,213
had one name
connected to the key.

439
00:40:03,246 --> 00:40:07,016
You guys are gonna want
to brace yourselves for this.

440
00:40:12,388 --> 00:40:14,492
No way.

441
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:16,192
That's exactly what I said.

442
00:40:16,226 --> 00:40:18,762
So you're saying
Han's death is connected

443
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:20,163
to all of this?

444
00:40:20,196 --> 00:40:22,265
He has to have
something to do with it.

445
00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:23,601
I'll look into it.

446
00:40:23,634 --> 00:40:25,168
Tej, can you send me

447
00:40:25,201 --> 00:40:27,437
- all the files you have on Han?
- Yeah.

448
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,607
I'll go with you.

449
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,040
Letty.

450
00:40:33,644 --> 00:40:36,012
I got this the day Han died.

451
00:40:36,747 --> 00:40:38,448
Mexico.

452
00:40:38,482 --> 00:40:39,817
Check the postmark.

453
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:44,354
Whatever he was up to,
it ended here.

454
00:40:44,387 --> 00:40:45,656
Tokyo.

455
00:40:45,689 --> 00:40:48,726
What are you gonna do
about Jakob?

456
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:51,427
I'm gonna find him.

457
00:40:53,664 --> 00:40:55,164
How?

458
00:40:55,799 --> 00:40:57,467
An old friend.

459
00:41:24,862 --> 00:41:26,630
Yo, what do you think?

460
00:41:26,664 --> 00:41:29,833
<i>¿Es una ilusión o es real?</i>

461
00:41:29,867 --> 00:41:32,135
It doesn't matter.

462
00:41:32,168 --> 00:41:33,469
It's all about
how you choose to see it.

463
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:36,306
Shit. I told you I was right.

464
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:39,309
- I'm Leo.
- Santos.

465
00:41:39,342 --> 00:41:41,444
Dom. What are you guys in for?

466
00:41:41,478 --> 00:41:43,313
Driving while brown.

467
00:41:53,891 --> 00:41:56,292
You see that?

468
00:41:56,326 --> 00:41:58,161
Hairline crack in the fuel line.

469
00:41:58,194 --> 00:42:00,196
Air gets in there,
you got a lean condition.

470
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:02,365
Lean condition?

471
00:42:49,312 --> 00:42:51,782
Yeah! Yeah, Jakob!

472
00:42:51,815 --> 00:42:54,384
That's what I'm talking about!

473
00:42:58,656 --> 00:43:00,289
Who wants next?

474
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:01,959
I said, who wants next?!

475
00:43:01,992 --> 00:43:03,560
I got next.

476
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:08,164
Dom.

477
00:43:08,832 --> 00:43:10,567
Well, when'd you get out, man?

478
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:12,670
I said I got next.

479
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:15,539
Come on, Dom.

480
00:43:16,807 --> 00:43:19,677
You don't want to race me
in Buddy's old Charger.

481
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,779
Car don't make the driver.

482
00:43:28,852 --> 00:43:30,954
Here's how this goes.

483
00:43:30,988 --> 00:43:32,990
You win...

484
00:43:33,023 --> 00:43:35,759
you can come back home.

485
00:43:35,793 --> 00:43:37,828
You lose...

486
00:43:37,861 --> 00:43:40,631
you keep driving,
you don't stop,

487
00:43:40,664 --> 00:43:43,500
you don't ever come back.

488
00:43:43,534 --> 00:43:45,903
Ever.

489
00:43:45,936 --> 00:43:47,303
What do you mean, Dom?

490
00:43:47,336 --> 00:43:49,272
I know what you did.

491
00:43:50,741 --> 00:43:54,912
The day we lost him, Dad kept
talking about a misfire.

492
00:43:54,945 --> 00:43:56,547
Remember?

493
00:43:57,581 --> 00:44:00,349
You were the last one
under his hood that day.

494
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:04,722
A minute later, he was gone.

495
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:08,357
Tell me why you killed Dad.

496
00:44:15,331 --> 00:44:17,400
Now let's race.

497
00:44:22,506 --> 00:44:23,907
Armed robbery in Echo Park.

498
00:44:23,941 --> 00:44:26,777
- Fourth Street Bridge is open.
- Clear, clear, clear!

499
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:48,866
Ready?

500
00:44:48,899 --> 00:44:50,299
Set.

501
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,537
Go.

502
00:46:17,821 --> 00:46:18,922
Too soon.

503
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,765
No!

504
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:17,514
...and beating the shortstop.

505
00:47:17,547 --> 00:47:20,584
Line drive over the head of Gonzalez

506
00:47:20,617 --> 00:47:22,819
on the field for a base hit.

507
00:47:24,821 --> 00:47:25,656
Up next...

508
00:47:28,825 --> 00:47:31,028
Place still looks the same.

509
00:47:32,729 --> 00:47:35,065
Just like your dad left it.

510
00:47:35,098 --> 00:47:37,801
I'm looking for Jakob.

511
00:47:40,904 --> 00:47:42,873
Can't help you, man.

512
00:47:42,906 --> 00:47:47,778
I know you took Jakob in
after my father died.

513
00:47:47,811 --> 00:47:50,914
The worst thing
you can do to a Toretto

514
00:47:50,948 --> 00:47:52,983
is take away their family.

515
00:47:54,618 --> 00:47:57,154
That's what you did to Jakob.

516
00:47:57,187 --> 00:48:01,992
You've got people who love you,
count on you, care for you.

517
00:48:02,025 --> 00:48:03,961
He ain't got no one.

518
00:48:03,994 --> 00:48:05,829
You get in his way,
this ain't gonna end

519
00:48:05,862 --> 00:48:07,731
until one of you guys
are in the ground.

520
00:48:07,764 --> 00:48:10,600
I know you did
the best you could, Buddy.

521
00:48:11,835 --> 00:48:15,739
But we both know he's about
to cause a lot of hurt.

522
00:48:27,617 --> 00:48:30,654
I did my best
to take care of Jakob.

523
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:34,624
But I'm no Jack Toretto.

524
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:54,711
You've got to make peace
with the past if you...

525
00:48:56,646 --> 00:48:58,882
...if you want hope
for the future.

526
00:49:06,223 --> 00:49:08,558
He's in London.

527
00:49:08,592 --> 00:49:10,794
That's all I know.

528
00:49:21,238 --> 00:49:23,073
Dom.

529
00:49:26,209 --> 00:49:28,712
I hope you find your peace.

530
00:49:31,381 --> 00:49:34,818
The chance for peace died
that day on the track.

531
00:49:59,042 --> 00:50:00,710
<i>Arigato.</i>

532
00:50:03,146 --> 00:50:05,148
This place is a dead end.

533
00:50:05,182 --> 00:50:08,618
Do you think Jakob could be
onto the Han connection?

534
00:50:09,653 --> 00:50:12,856
If he has all the information
we do, probably.

535
00:50:16,226 --> 00:50:18,128
I never told Dom...

536
00:50:19,796 --> 00:50:22,999
I stayed in touch with him for
a while after what happened.

537
00:50:24,034 --> 00:50:27,237
He was over at Buddy's
for about a year, and then...

538
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:29,739
he was gone with
a message not to follow.

539
00:50:30,841 --> 00:50:32,843
But after he disappeared,
I was so desperate to find him

540
00:50:32,876 --> 00:50:35,846
that I would've...
would've done anything.

541
00:50:35,879 --> 00:50:37,848
I even broke into
a police archive,

542
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:39,249
but I didn't find anything.

543
00:50:39,282 --> 00:50:40,984
You what?

544
00:50:41,017 --> 00:50:42,652
You were like 16.

545
00:50:43,753 --> 00:50:45,755
I did what I had to do.

546
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:48,758
Yeah.

547
00:50:51,161 --> 00:50:53,196
How about you?

548
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:54,965
How are you doing?

549
00:50:54,998 --> 00:50:57,033
It's a change of pace, huh?

550
00:50:58,902 --> 00:51:01,104
Just as I was remembering...

551
00:51:03,073 --> 00:51:05,041
...who I was,

552
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:07,144
everything changed.

553
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:10,046
It slowed down.

554
00:51:10,914 --> 00:51:13,183
There's peace for me
in the chaos.

555
00:51:13,216 --> 00:51:17,154
It's like I... I need to face
the world head-on or something

556
00:51:17,187 --> 00:51:18,822
to feel alive.

557
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,159
Seeing Little Brian

558
00:51:22,192 --> 00:51:25,829
hiding in a hole because
we had unexpected company...

559
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:29,032
...that got to me.

560
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:33,003
We never used to hide.

561
00:51:34,337 --> 00:51:38,141
Hey, Dom's my brother, but you
will always be my sister.

562
00:51:38,942 --> 00:51:42,179
Funny how we all have secrets.

563
00:51:48,151 --> 00:51:50,120
What?

564
00:51:50,153 --> 00:51:52,355
You got to be kidding me.

565
00:51:52,389 --> 00:51:53,990
What is it?

566
00:51:54,024 --> 00:51:56,826
Remember what Han used to say
about Tokyo?

567
00:51:59,095 --> 00:52:01,264
You mean how
in all the old Westerns,

568
00:52:01,298 --> 00:52:03,400
cowboys would make a run
for the border to get away

569
00:52:03,433 --> 00:52:05,503
from the law,
how Tokyo was his...

570
00:52:05,536 --> 00:52:06,970
Mexico.

571
00:52:11,174 --> 00:52:12,976
No way.

572
00:52:29,192 --> 00:52:30,961
She's ready to roll.

573
00:52:30,994 --> 00:52:33,096
No. No!

574
00:52:33,129 --> 00:52:34,364
No, Sean!

575
00:52:34,397 --> 00:52:35,966
Tell me you are not modding

576
00:52:35,999 --> 00:52:37,467
the quick disconnect valve
on the LOX line.

577
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:38,468
Hey, man, chill out.

578
00:52:38,502 --> 00:52:40,070
All right? It's all good.

579
00:52:40,103 --> 00:52:42,506
- That tweak just saved us 0.4 seconds.
- "All good"?

580
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,108
This isn't <i>Top Gun,</i> Maverick.

581
00:52:45,141 --> 00:52:46,443
You don't follow
the rules here, you die.

582
00:52:46,477 --> 00:52:48,778
Hey, come on.
That's a bit much.

583
00:52:48,812 --> 00:52:50,981
When you know what too much
pressure in the LOX line

584
00:52:51,014 --> 00:52:52,249
can do, come talk to me.

585
00:52:52,282 --> 00:52:53,450
Till then, stay in your lane.

586
00:52:53,484 --> 00:52:55,185
Yo, you're lucky
to even be in my lane.

587
00:52:55,218 --> 00:52:57,220
In case you forgot,
I'm the one that figured out

588
00:52:57,254 --> 00:53:00,257
how to let us build
rocket engines and get paid.

589
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:02,325
This whole thing was my idea.

590
00:53:02,359 --> 00:53:05,228
So who are you gonna trust
with your brilliant idea,

591
00:53:05,262 --> 00:53:07,464
this glorified mechanic...

592
00:53:07,498 --> 00:53:08,965
or a rocket scientist?

593
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:11,034
Without me, you'd be
working at Jiffy Lube.

594
00:53:11,067 --> 00:53:12,168
Guys, guys.

595
00:53:12,202 --> 00:53:12,869
Look, it's all good.

596
00:53:12,902 --> 00:53:14,437
Who cares about who did what?

597
00:53:14,471 --> 00:53:16,106
Kind of hard for you
to do anything

598
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:17,907
when you pee your pants
every time you fly, Twinkie.

599
00:53:17,941 --> 00:53:19,876
Did I hear that right?

600
00:53:19,909 --> 00:53:22,279
You a runner
and you afraid of flying?

601
00:53:23,581 --> 00:53:25,549
"Twinkie"?

602
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:29,286
So you must be
Ding Dong and Snoball.

603
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:31,522
- Right?
- Yo, uh...

604
00:53:31,555 --> 00:53:33,056
I don't go by that name anymore.

605
00:53:33,089 --> 00:53:35,593
You went by that name ever?

606
00:53:35,626 --> 00:53:36,993
Like, ever?

607
00:53:37,027 --> 00:53:38,295
I... That's-that's-that's...

608
00:53:39,996 --> 00:53:42,799
- Hey! We're up.
- Oh, good.

609
00:53:44,234 --> 00:53:45,402
Hey, fellas.

610
00:53:45,435 --> 00:53:47,370
Y'all seen ten-second cars?

611
00:53:48,271 --> 00:53:52,175
Well, say hello
to the two-second car.

612
00:53:59,049 --> 00:54:02,319
Is that a Pontiac Fiero

613
00:54:02,352 --> 00:54:03,987
strapped to a rocket engine?

614
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,189
Impressive, I know.

615
00:54:06,222 --> 00:54:07,057
No.

616
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:08,958
No, that's not impressive.

617
00:54:10,628 --> 00:54:13,196
Eyes up! Here it comes!
Let the race begin!

618
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,348
Plane's taking off!

619
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:33,116
Go, go, go, go!

620
00:54:49,332 --> 00:54:51,000
Yes!

621
00:54:52,402 --> 00:54:53,370
We did it!

622
00:55:00,009 --> 00:55:03,947
Uh... I'm confused.

623
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,583
Y'all didn't actually
beat the jet.

624
00:55:05,616 --> 00:55:07,518
It didn't explode.

625
00:55:07,551 --> 00:55:09,386
- Yeah, or melt.
- Yeah.

626
00:55:09,419 --> 00:55:11,287
She's still in one piece.

627
00:55:17,293 --> 00:55:18,361
You mean "pieces"?

628
00:55:18,395 --> 00:55:23,066
Hey, Jiffy Lube, next time,
will you listen to me?

629
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:26,970
Look, we heard y'all could
get us some wheels.

630
00:55:27,003 --> 00:55:29,372
Preferably the kind
that don't explode.

631
00:55:29,406 --> 00:55:31,040
Is that possible?

632
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:34,043
Well, the Honda dealership's
about 3,000 miles that way.

633
00:55:34,077 --> 00:55:36,279
Dominic Toretto sent us.

634
00:55:43,987 --> 00:55:46,122
Who's Dominic Toretto?

635
00:56:35,573 --> 00:56:37,240
Hmm.

636
00:56:39,643 --> 00:56:42,111
Nice necklace, Queenie.

637
00:56:43,112 --> 00:56:46,484
Diamonds and emeralds
never looked so good.

638
00:56:46,517 --> 00:56:48,552
Dominic Toretto.

639
00:56:50,286 --> 00:56:53,156
The word on the street is
you got locked up.

640
00:56:53,189 --> 00:56:56,226
Yeah, well, in and out,
you know.

641
00:56:56,259 --> 00:56:58,496
When are they gonna learn?

642
00:56:58,529 --> 00:57:00,296
Some birds can't be caged.

643
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:02,600
Are you looking for
one of me sons?

644
00:57:03,734 --> 00:57:06,236
Not tonight.

645
00:57:06,269 --> 00:57:09,105
You do the driving,
I'll cut you in for 15%.

646
00:57:12,576 --> 00:57:15,479
My thieving days are over.

647
00:57:16,412 --> 00:57:18,114
Mine ain't.

648
00:57:19,315 --> 00:57:21,251
You coming?

649
00:57:52,315 --> 00:57:54,150
I'm looking for someone.

650
00:57:54,183 --> 00:57:56,854
Would've shown up in town
a little while ago.

651
00:57:56,887 --> 00:57:59,857
A lot of guys,
a lot of resources.

652
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:02,158
Oh, yeah, yeah,
word did go round

653
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:04,828
on a crew that just turned up,
led by an American.

654
00:58:10,601 --> 00:58:13,169
Yeah, he bought some arms
off a local seller.

655
00:58:13,202 --> 00:58:16,306
Rumor had it he was into
something big up in Edinburgh.

656
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:23,379
Local seller, huh?

657
00:58:23,413 --> 00:58:25,849
She wouldn't happen to be
wearing a stolen necklace,

658
00:58:25,883 --> 00:58:27,216
- would she?
- He paid well.

659
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,319
What was I supposed to do?

660
00:58:33,591 --> 00:58:35,726
This geezer was about
your height, actually.

661
00:58:35,759 --> 00:58:38,361
Similar features.

662
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:41,899
Oh, bloody hell, he's not your
cousin or something, is he?

663
00:58:41,932 --> 00:58:44,334
He's my brother.

664
00:58:47,638 --> 00:58:49,506
Get the hand brake for me,
would you, darling?

665
00:58:58,749 --> 00:59:01,785
Glad I'm not the only one with
a family full of eccentrics.

666
00:59:03,654 --> 00:59:05,689
He offered payment
for something else.

667
00:59:08,424 --> 00:59:09,693
You.

668
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:38,956
You know,
nothing's more powerful

669
00:59:38,989 --> 00:59:40,658
than the love of family.

670
00:59:40,691 --> 00:59:44,394
But you turn that
into anger and resentment,

671
00:59:44,427 --> 00:59:47,330
nothing's more dangerous.

672
00:59:52,468 --> 00:59:53,904
Dom?

673
00:59:53,937 --> 00:59:56,674
Don't get yourself killed, okay?

674
00:59:56,707 --> 00:59:58,374
You're my favorite American.

675
01:00:23,299 --> 01:00:25,969
This is your kind of party,
isn't it, Dom?

676
01:00:26,003 --> 01:00:28,972
Beautiful women, best cars,
best everything.

677
01:00:29,006 --> 01:00:30,974
You know, best security, too.

678
01:00:31,008 --> 01:00:34,210
I'm Otto.
I'm your brother's partner.

679
01:00:38,347 --> 01:00:40,383
Well, fi-financier.

680
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:42,251
But, you know, my dad,
he's a dictator,

681
01:00:42,285 --> 01:00:44,021
so we're not talking
regular people rich here.

682
01:00:44,054 --> 01:00:45,321
No, no, no, no, no.

683
01:00:45,354 --> 01:00:46,590
Everything you see here, I own.

684
01:00:46,623 --> 01:00:48,659
These girls, if you want
to meet one of them,

685
01:00:48,692 --> 01:00:49,927
maybe two, maybe three,

686
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,662
just let me know.
They're on the payroll.

687
01:00:51,695 --> 01:00:54,598
I offer a bomb-ass dental plan,
too. Huh?

688
01:00:54,631 --> 01:00:55,899
Where is Jakob?

689
01:00:55,933 --> 01:00:57,801
He's inside.

690
01:01:38,075 --> 01:01:40,677
The brother
you're looking for...

691
01:01:40,711 --> 01:01:42,513
he's from an old life.

692
01:01:43,947 --> 01:01:46,049
- He's long gone.
- All I see is the same

693
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:48,652
scared little kid
that killed our father.

694
01:01:50,821 --> 01:01:52,756
That's your mistake.

695
01:01:54,691 --> 01:01:56,927
The spy game...

696
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,762
this is my world.

697
01:02:03,466 --> 01:02:05,468
So here's my offer.

698
01:02:06,136 --> 01:02:08,437
It's the same one you gave me.

699
01:02:11,608 --> 01:02:12,743
You leave.

700
01:02:12,776 --> 01:02:14,578
Now.

701
01:02:14,611 --> 01:02:19,683
You drive away,
and you never come back.

702
01:02:19,716 --> 01:02:20,751
Ever.

703
01:02:20,784 --> 01:02:22,686
A deal?

704
01:02:23,854 --> 01:02:25,722
I showed you mercy!

705
01:02:27,758 --> 01:02:29,860
And I won't show it
to you again.

706
01:02:39,837 --> 01:02:40,904
Toretto.

707
01:02:42,539 --> 01:02:45,408
Since my dad is head of state,

708
01:02:45,441 --> 01:02:47,578
it makes me a foreign dignitary

709
01:02:47,611 --> 01:02:50,413
and this place an embassy.

710
01:02:50,446 --> 01:02:52,616
Which means you just trespassed

711
01:02:52,649 --> 01:02:54,518
into my country
and attempted murder.

712
01:02:54,551 --> 01:02:56,587
So, naturally, I called in
a little favor

713
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,689
with all my good friends
from Interpol.

714
01:02:58,722 --> 01:03:02,125
You keep digging around
in the past, Dom,

715
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:04,561
you're not gonna like
what you find.

716
01:03:12,536 --> 01:03:15,404
And here I thought my dad
was a pain in the ass.

717
01:03:15,438 --> 01:03:19,009
But your family is
a train wreck.

718
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:22,512
Well, now that your brother's
finally out of the game,

719
01:03:22,546 --> 01:03:24,514
it's time we go to Edinburgh.

720
01:03:24,548 --> 01:03:28,886
Get the second piece, maybe
do a little sightseeing, huh?

721
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,588
Any news on the key?

722
01:03:31,622 --> 01:03:33,790
Don't worry about it.
Our men are closing in.

723
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:39,663
One week from now, there won't
be a superpower in the world

724
01:03:39,696 --> 01:03:41,498
can take a piss
without our permission.

725
01:03:41,531 --> 01:03:43,500
One week from now,
your dad will be asking you

726
01:03:43,533 --> 01:03:45,702
for an allowance.

727
01:03:45,736 --> 01:03:46,803
I'd like that.

728
01:03:48,471 --> 01:03:49,940
I'd like that.

729
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:04,154
Whew.

730
01:04:05,489 --> 01:04:06,690
What's up?

731
01:04:08,492 --> 01:04:10,928
- Well done, Leysa.
- Please.

732
01:04:10,961 --> 01:04:14,097
If it wasn't for you, I'd still
be stealing gas in the D.R.

733
01:04:14,131 --> 01:04:16,166
So Queenie treating you right?

734
01:04:16,199 --> 01:04:17,466
Like a <i>princesa.</i>

735
01:04:17,501 --> 01:04:18,702
I'm her number-one pick,
you know.

736
01:04:18,735 --> 01:04:20,804
Cara's little sister done good.

737
01:04:20,837 --> 01:04:21,738
Good?

738
01:04:21,772 --> 01:04:24,074
You saw my fine ass
in that white dress.

739
01:04:24,107 --> 01:04:25,776
You see how I been rocking shit?

740
01:04:25,809 --> 01:04:28,578
All this crew,
this is mine. Huh?

741
01:04:28,612 --> 01:04:30,147
I been around the world.

742
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,548
Oh, I almost forgot.

743
01:04:31,581 --> 01:04:33,483
You might need this.

744
01:04:33,517 --> 01:04:36,520
Your boy Jakob biometrics
are encoded to this gun.

745
01:04:36,553 --> 01:04:39,589
You'll have no trouble
tracking him now.

746
01:05:17,027 --> 01:05:18,695
Hey, Letty.

747
01:05:19,629 --> 01:05:20,864
Yeah.

748
01:05:20,897 --> 01:05:23,066
Come look at this.

749
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,267
What the hell?

750
01:05:24,301 --> 01:05:27,537
Han never mentioned
a girl, not ever.

751
01:05:29,339 --> 01:05:31,174
Letty, Mia!

752
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:32,576
Down, now!

753
01:07:28,225 --> 01:07:30,026
You okay?

754
01:08:31,054 --> 01:08:34,925
Welcome to Saint Giles'
Cathedral of Edinburgh.

755
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:39,763
The High Kirk has a history
stretching back over 900 years.

756
01:08:39,796 --> 01:08:41,998
Renowned for
its stained glass windows,

757
01:08:42,032 --> 01:08:45,168
you can see
the intricate craftsmanship...

758
01:08:48,038 --> 01:08:50,073
We're a go.

759
01:08:57,013 --> 01:08:58,848
Ramsey, talk to me.
What do we got?

760
01:08:58,882 --> 01:09:00,884
I pulled Jakob's biometric
signature off the gun,

761
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:02,352
and the algorithm I've run says

762
01:09:02,385 --> 01:09:04,454
Jakob's team is
right on top of us.

763
01:09:04,488 --> 01:09:06,923
Anywhere between
80 and 100 meters.

764
01:09:06,957 --> 01:09:09,493
80 meters?
That's a lot around here.

765
01:09:09,527 --> 01:09:12,362
This whole area
seems pretty packed in.

766
01:09:12,395 --> 01:09:14,197
So, we don't know

767
01:09:14,231 --> 01:09:17,367
where the secret vault facility
Jakob is looking to hit is,

768
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,502
now, do we?

769
01:09:18,536 --> 01:09:20,870
Wouldn't be a secret if we did.

770
01:09:20,904 --> 01:09:22,272
You know what?

771
01:09:22,305 --> 01:09:24,808
I'm starting to think
your little English accent

772
01:09:24,841 --> 01:09:27,043
makes you sound smarter
than you are.

773
01:09:32,115 --> 01:09:34,251
Man, can I point out
that a good old-fashioned

774
01:09:34,284 --> 01:09:35,553
tracking chip would've put us

775
01:09:35,586 --> 01:09:37,153
within like
six feet of this dude?

776
01:09:37,187 --> 01:09:39,490
But, nah, instead,
we out here with biometrics

777
01:09:39,523 --> 01:09:41,458
and facial recognition imaging.

778
01:09:41,492 --> 01:09:43,293
Feels like we looking
for Where's Waldo

779
01:09:43,326 --> 01:09:46,162
- in Harry Potter world.
- Yeah, uh,

780
01:09:46,196 --> 01:09:49,065
strong argument there, Tej, but
tracking chips follow the chip.

781
01:09:49,099 --> 01:09:51,101
Before we know it,
we'd be chasing some expensive

782
01:09:51,134 --> 01:09:53,403
yet tacky jacket
to the dry cleaner's.

783
01:09:53,436 --> 01:09:56,039
Biometrics, on the other hand,
are impossible to...

784
01:09:58,008 --> 01:09:59,042
Wait.

785
01:09:59,075 --> 01:10:01,044
Guys, okay, we have a problem.

786
01:10:01,077 --> 01:10:02,513
Cameras are going down
all around us,

787
01:10:02,546 --> 01:10:05,282
and my equipment is
freaking out.

788
01:10:07,083 --> 01:10:09,152
What the hell, Jimmy?

789
01:10:09,185 --> 01:10:11,388
Security alert.
Cameras are down.

790
01:10:13,591 --> 01:10:15,292
Damn.

791
01:10:15,325 --> 01:10:16,893
You see anything suspicious?

792
01:10:16,926 --> 01:10:18,562
Uh, where do I start?

793
01:10:18,596 --> 01:10:22,065
First of all, all of this
looks a little spooky.

794
01:10:22,098 --> 01:10:24,234
I even seen
these two ladies walking

795
01:10:24,267 --> 01:10:27,404
with George Washington wigs
on their head from the 1700s.

796
01:10:27,437 --> 01:10:30,608
I feel like I'm in Transylvania
or some damn where.

797
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:45,355
Ramsey,
we're looking everywhere.

798
01:10:45,388 --> 01:10:46,590
I just grew a new bunion.

799
01:10:46,624 --> 01:10:48,858
This is hopeless.

800
01:10:50,293 --> 01:10:51,394
What?

801
01:10:51,428 --> 01:10:53,564
- You see that?
- See what?

802
01:10:53,597 --> 01:10:55,332
The ears.

803
01:10:55,365 --> 01:10:57,267
They got cauliflower ears.

804
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,235
They fight for a living.

805
01:11:00,604 --> 01:11:03,006
- Don't worry about it.
- Roman.

806
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:05,241
Hey, man, I ordered
a pair of Crocs

807
01:11:05,275 --> 01:11:09,079
three weeks ago,
and I'm still waiting!

808
01:11:12,382 --> 01:11:14,884
Where are my shoes, man?!

809
01:11:16,953 --> 01:11:19,557
Man, we really need
to work on your planning.

810
01:11:21,124 --> 01:11:24,060
Hey, Dom, you should
get down to the cathedral.

811
01:11:24,094 --> 01:11:25,962
Dumbass here just attacked
some delivery dudes

812
01:11:25,995 --> 01:11:27,864
'cause he didn't like
their ears.

813
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,167
Wait, wait, wait.

814
01:11:31,201 --> 01:11:33,937
H-How much did you say
you paid for that again?

815
01:11:34,638 --> 01:11:37,006
You know silver
ain't magnetic, right?

816
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,376
You know what?
Sh... Just shut up.

817
01:11:39,409 --> 01:11:40,644
Just shut up.

818
01:11:40,678 --> 01:11:43,012
Ramsey, say we had
a big electromagnet

819
01:11:43,046 --> 01:11:45,649
turned up right around here.

820
01:11:45,683 --> 01:11:48,385
Wouldn't that disrupt
all electronic signals?

821
01:11:48,418 --> 01:11:50,286
Including security systems.
That's it.

822
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,889
That's how Jakob's
getting into the vault.

823
01:11:57,026 --> 01:11:58,294
Guys?

824
01:11:59,262 --> 01:12:00,296
Guys?

825
01:12:02,966 --> 01:12:05,368
Okay, we've got police
coming from all sides.

826
01:12:05,402 --> 01:12:08,405
- The area's locking down.
- He ain't using roads.

827
01:12:22,352 --> 01:12:24,655
I got eyes on Jakob.

828
01:12:33,196 --> 01:12:34,532
I see Otto.

829
01:12:36,567 --> 01:12:38,268
I'm gonna tail him.

830
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:49,279
He's heading towards
a blue Jaguar.

831
01:12:49,312 --> 01:12:50,180
Okay, follow him.

832
01:12:50,213 --> 01:12:52,550
Me? I can't.

833
01:12:52,583 --> 01:12:53,717
Why not?

834
01:12:53,751 --> 01:12:55,452
Okay, this is a bad time
to tell you this,

835
01:12:55,486 --> 01:12:57,187
but I don't drive.

836
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:59,222
Okay? I never got my license.
I don't know how to drive.

837
01:12:59,255 --> 01:13:01,424
And, you know, no one
really drives in London.

838
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:04,327
Okay? And that is not
my contribution to this group.

839
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:05,395
It's you or no one.

840
01:13:18,642 --> 01:13:19,777
Shit.

841
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:21,679
Guys, come on, man.

842
01:13:21,712 --> 01:13:23,179
I feel like,
between the six of us,

843
01:13:23,213 --> 01:13:25,415
we can work this out, right?

844
01:13:33,791 --> 01:13:35,493
Okay. I've got...

845
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:44,502
Ramsey, shut it off!

846
01:13:44,535 --> 01:13:45,769
Shut it off!

847
01:13:47,403 --> 01:13:48,404
Go, go, go!

848
01:13:48,438 --> 01:13:50,306
Okay. Uh...

849
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:53,042
Brake is on the left,
accelerator right.

850
01:13:55,646 --> 01:13:56,814
Oh.

851
01:14:48,264 --> 01:14:50,233
Shit.

852
01:14:53,871 --> 01:14:55,271
Hey!

853
01:15:07,885 --> 01:15:10,186
Oh! Sorry!

854
01:15:27,771 --> 01:15:29,607
Whoa!

855
01:15:53,864 --> 01:15:56,265
Oh, no!

856
01:15:57,801 --> 01:15:59,235
Move!

857
01:15:59,268 --> 01:16:01,337
Hey, that was not my fault!

858
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,181
Okay, that one was my fault.

859
01:16:45,816 --> 01:16:47,751
See?

860
01:16:47,785 --> 01:16:49,820
What'd I tell you?

861
01:16:49,853 --> 01:16:51,454
Not even a scratch.

862
01:17:05,602 --> 01:17:06,937
Otto, sending you
new pickup location.

863
01:17:15,445 --> 01:17:17,581
I've got it.
I'm headed to you now.

864
01:17:57,054 --> 01:17:58,421
Otto, where are you?

865
01:17:58,454 --> 01:18:01,424
Jakob, I'm there.
I don't see anybody.

866
01:18:02,493 --> 01:18:04,293
It's because you're
on the wrong street.

867
01:18:38,461 --> 01:18:39,863
That's my car, pal!

868
01:18:39,897 --> 01:18:41,698
Dom!

869
01:18:45,969 --> 01:18:48,337
Go!

870
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:52,676
Damn it.

871
01:19:24,007 --> 01:19:25,108
You're a natural.

872
01:19:25,142 --> 01:19:27,945
Of course I am.

873
01:19:41,491 --> 01:19:42,726
Okay, listen up!

874
01:19:42,759 --> 01:19:45,596
I want 50 of the best men!
I want guns!

875
01:19:45,629 --> 01:19:48,866
I want wheels, freaking
X-wing fighters... I don't care!

876
01:19:48,899 --> 01:19:50,033
The <i>Millennium Falcon,</i>

877
01:19:50,067 --> 01:19:51,702
Chewbacca if you can
get ahold of him.

878
01:19:51,735 --> 01:19:54,104
Money's no object. Go.

879
01:19:54,137 --> 01:19:56,540
Go!

880
01:20:05,849 --> 01:20:07,584
What?

881
01:20:08,919 --> 01:20:10,787
What's so funny?

882
01:20:11,788 --> 01:20:13,757
I...

883
01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:16,994
I was thinking,
if this was a movie,

884
01:20:17,027 --> 01:20:18,495
this would be the moment

885
01:20:18,528 --> 01:20:21,899
where the villain has
an unexpected setback,

886
01:20:21,932 --> 01:20:24,701
overcompensates without
thinking it through

887
01:20:24,735 --> 01:20:26,970
and gets crushed
by the good guys.

888
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:32,910
No offense, but you have
no idea what we're about to do.

889
01:20:32,943 --> 01:20:36,079
And for the record,
we're the good guys.

890
01:20:36,113 --> 01:20:38,649
Me?
I'm Luke freaking Skywalker.

891
01:20:38,682 --> 01:20:40,117
Are you sure about that?

892
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:43,654
I mean, I get
the daddy issues, but...

893
01:20:45,188 --> 01:20:47,557
Look at what you've built.

894
01:20:48,825 --> 01:20:50,794
Really? Luke?

895
01:20:51,862 --> 01:20:53,163
You're right.

896
01:20:53,196 --> 01:20:55,732
No, I'm more of a Han Solo.

897
01:20:56,733 --> 01:20:58,035
No.

898
01:21:00,203 --> 01:21:01,538
You're Yoda.

899
01:21:01,571 --> 01:21:03,472
- Yoda?
- Mm-hmm.

900
01:21:03,507 --> 01:21:04,908
No. The little green guy?

901
01:21:04,942 --> 01:21:06,543
- Yeah.
- No.

902
01:21:07,911 --> 01:21:10,247
Ah, shit, I'll take it.

903
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,215
Because he's
a powerful Jedi, right?

904
01:21:12,249 --> 01:21:14,551
No.

905
01:21:14,584 --> 01:21:16,452
Yoda's a puppet.

906
01:21:18,588 --> 01:21:21,224
With someone's hand up his ass.

907
01:21:44,548 --> 01:21:46,516
So what now, Dom?

908
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:49,987
No one outruns their past.

909
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:51,722
And yours just caught up to you.

910
01:22:00,964 --> 01:22:02,532
Man.

911
01:22:02,566 --> 01:22:04,234
There is
literally zero industrial

912
01:22:04,267 --> 01:22:06,303
or weapons-grade electromagnets
I can find

913
01:22:06,336 --> 01:22:07,871
that are this powerful.

914
01:22:07,904 --> 01:22:09,272
Look at the pull strength
level here.

915
01:22:09,306 --> 01:22:11,575
- It's crazy.
- Yeah.

916
01:22:11,608 --> 01:22:13,777
Wait, watch this.

917
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:32,229
Every time. I can't believe it.

918
01:22:32,262 --> 01:22:34,131
What are you doing, bruh?

919
01:22:34,164 --> 01:22:35,599
I'm hungry.

920
01:22:35,632 --> 01:22:37,567
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, damn.

921
01:22:37,601 --> 01:22:39,069
Surprise.

922
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:44,941
Nice clubhouse.

923
01:22:55,152 --> 01:22:56,953
'Sup, man?

924
01:23:01,324 --> 01:23:02,859
Nice to meet you.

925
01:23:19,109 --> 01:23:21,845
So you got my postcard, huh?

926
01:23:38,695 --> 01:23:42,032
I'm just still
trying to figure out...

927
01:23:42,065 --> 01:23:44,134
How are you still alive?

928
01:23:46,269 --> 01:23:49,739
Well, after Gisele died...

929
01:23:49,773 --> 01:23:51,975
I didn't know what to do.

930
01:23:52,943 --> 01:23:54,177
I was aimless.

931
01:23:55,779 --> 01:23:57,380
- Lost.
- Absolutely.

932
01:23:57,414 --> 01:23:59,883
But can you get
to the part where

933
01:23:59,916 --> 01:24:02,385
the car exploded
and you're still alive?

934
01:24:02,419 --> 01:24:04,387
- Like, I'm trying to...
- Roman, can you...

935
01:24:04,421 --> 01:24:06,356
can you just be quiet
for one minute?

936
01:24:06,389 --> 01:24:08,758
We made plans.

937
01:24:10,026 --> 01:24:10,927
We had dreams.

938
01:24:10,961 --> 01:24:14,097
So what's our next adventure
after this?

939
01:24:16,299 --> 01:24:19,903
How about...
we stay in one place?

940
01:24:20,971 --> 01:24:23,340
- Where you thinking?
- Tokyo.

941
01:24:23,373 --> 01:24:26,143
We always talk about Tokyo.

942
01:24:26,176 --> 01:24:27,911
Tokyo it is.

943
01:24:29,012 --> 01:24:31,815
<i>You know, it's funny,
Gisele led me there,</i>

944
01:24:31,848 --> 01:24:34,985
and I wasn't even
looking for it.

945
01:24:37,287 --> 01:24:38,955
But it became home.

946
01:24:40,123 --> 01:24:42,826
Then one day,
Mr. Nobody came calling.

947
01:24:42,859 --> 01:24:44,828
<i>I worked with Gisele.</i>

948
01:24:44,861 --> 01:24:46,830
Back when I was a CIA operative

949
01:24:46,863 --> 01:24:50,100
running the drug trade
in Central America.

950
01:24:51,468 --> 01:24:53,036
The good old days.

951
01:24:53,069 --> 01:24:55,372
Gisele was my best.

952
01:24:55,405 --> 01:24:57,807
You can lose an asset
at any time.

953
01:24:59,409 --> 01:25:02,946
Bullet, knife, wire.

954
01:25:02,979 --> 01:25:06,116
But I never thought
I'd lose her...

955
01:25:06,149 --> 01:25:07,817
to love.

956
01:25:10,787 --> 01:25:11,922
What do you want?

957
01:25:11,955 --> 01:25:15,258
I'm offering you a job, Han.

958
01:25:15,292 --> 01:25:17,360
Here, in Tokyo.

959
01:25:17,394 --> 01:25:18,929
Why me?

960
01:25:18,962 --> 01:25:21,198
'Cause I saw your work
with Gisele.

961
01:25:21,231 --> 01:25:23,934
I saw that she trusted you.

962
01:25:25,101 --> 01:25:27,971
And that means I can trust you.

963
01:25:28,004 --> 01:25:33,109
And that is very rare
in this line of work.

964
01:25:38,215 --> 01:25:40,283
<i>And all I knew
was that I had to steal</i>

965
01:25:40,317 --> 01:25:43,720
<i>some tech from the home
of a scientist couple.</i>

966
01:25:47,257 --> 01:25:49,759
<i>But as usual...</i>

967
01:25:49,793 --> 01:25:52,128
<i>Mr. Nobody didn't
tell me everything.</i>

968
01:25:53,531 --> 01:25:56,132
In fact, he left out
the most important part.

969
01:26:01,104 --> 01:26:02,839
I was 11.

970
01:26:02,872 --> 01:26:05,809
My parents would take me
to the movies on Saturdays

971
01:26:05,842 --> 01:26:08,211
if I tried hard in school
during the week.

972
01:26:09,379 --> 01:26:11,815
<i>I was so excited to go</i>

973
01:26:11,848 --> 01:26:15,819
<i>I forgot my raincoat,
so I went back in.</i>

974
01:26:22,058 --> 01:26:24,294
<i>At first, I didn't see it.</i>

975
01:26:26,229 --> 01:26:28,798
By the time
I looked out the window...

976
01:26:31,569 --> 01:26:33,537
Mom and Dad were gone.

977
01:26:33,571 --> 01:26:35,272
Turns out
I wasn't the only one

978
01:26:35,305 --> 01:26:37,173
<i>looking for this thing.</i>

979
01:27:03,601 --> 01:27:05,802
Get down!

980
01:27:14,878 --> 01:27:16,313
<i>Han saved me.</i>

981
01:27:16,346 --> 01:27:18,549
<i>Wouldn't leave me behind.</i>

982
01:27:18,582 --> 01:27:23,420
He knew I'd always be a target,
so he taught me how to survive.

983
01:27:26,222 --> 01:27:28,158
We became a family.

984
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:32,429
"Always be a target"?

985
01:27:34,364 --> 01:27:35,865
Why?

986
01:27:35,899 --> 01:27:37,967
'Cause she is the key.

987
01:27:42,105 --> 01:27:45,408
Everybody's been looking
for a thing.

988
01:27:45,442 --> 01:27:47,611
It was a person all along.

989
01:27:47,645 --> 01:27:49,312
My parents didn't want

990
01:27:49,346 --> 01:27:52,082
Project Aries to fall
into the wrong hands,

991
01:27:52,115 --> 01:27:55,885
so they locked it with their
own DNA, something we share.

992
01:27:56,986 --> 01:27:59,122
And then, one day,
Mr. Nobody gave me the heads-up

993
01:27:59,155 --> 01:28:02,626
that one of his best agents
went rogue.

994
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:04,628
<i>So when Deckard Shaw
came calling,</i>

995
01:28:04,662 --> 01:28:06,296
<i>we used it as cover.</i>

996
01:28:12,202 --> 01:28:15,338
But you got killed
in a car crash, Han.

997
01:28:17,006 --> 01:28:19,442
Mr. Nobody had a way
of making things look real.

998
01:28:27,417 --> 01:28:29,986
Pretty nifty magic trick.

999
01:28:30,019 --> 01:28:32,255
Yeah, I've done better.

1000
01:28:34,023 --> 01:28:36,226
Now for the hard part.

1001
01:28:38,294 --> 01:28:39,697
Keeping you dead.

1002
01:28:42,298 --> 01:28:43,667
My death...

1003
01:28:43,701 --> 01:28:45,935
Became the best way
to stay alive.

1004
01:28:51,274 --> 01:28:52,610
- What's happening?
- It's some kind of

1005
01:28:52,643 --> 01:28:54,444
hidden subroutine
the system follows.

1006
01:29:18,101 --> 01:29:20,437
That's it, right there.

1007
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:23,239
Yeah, nobody moves...

1008
01:29:23,273 --> 01:29:25,241
everybody lives.

1009
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:31,347
Jakob.

1010
01:29:33,383 --> 01:29:34,951
I'm sorry, Mia.

1011
01:29:38,522 --> 01:29:40,558
I was the rogue agent.

1012
01:29:40,591 --> 01:29:41,592
Me.

1013
01:29:43,092 --> 01:29:45,328
Dom, you ever think about
how Mr. Nobody found you?

1014
01:29:45,361 --> 01:29:47,731
Think he just dropped
out of the sky and chose you?

1015
01:29:47,765 --> 01:29:52,368
I ran missions with Mr. Nobody
out of this place for years.

1016
01:29:55,104 --> 01:29:58,007
I've been looking for that key
for a long time, Dom.

1017
01:29:58,776 --> 01:30:00,578
And you just handed her over.

1018
01:30:01,779 --> 01:30:03,413
I told you.

1019
01:30:04,548 --> 01:30:06,249
This is my world.

1020
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:09,419
Got it.

1021
01:30:09,452 --> 01:30:11,287
Got a lot of guys here.

1022
01:30:11,321 --> 01:30:13,389
You trust 'em?

1023
01:30:13,423 --> 01:30:14,525
Trust this.

1024
01:30:20,096 --> 01:30:22,432
You know the only good thing
to come from Dad dying?

1025
01:30:25,669 --> 01:30:29,138
If he hadn't, I'd have spent
my entire life in your shadow.

1026
01:30:31,675 --> 01:30:36,246
And now you're gonna spend the
rest of yours living in mine.

1027
01:30:39,449 --> 01:30:43,186
Only good thing
about Dad dying...

1028
01:30:43,219 --> 01:30:45,623
was he didn't have to watch
what you became.

1029
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:49,225
You never deserved
the Toretto name.

1030
01:30:51,294 --> 01:30:52,696
You think you knew Dad, huh?

1031
01:30:52,730 --> 01:30:55,131
What, 'cause you were his
favorite? You don't know shit!

1032
01:30:56,266 --> 01:30:57,635
Okay?

1033
01:30:57,668 --> 01:30:59,603
You want the truth?

1034
01:31:02,438 --> 01:31:05,441
Dad died 'cause he was trying
to throw that race.

1035
01:31:06,309 --> 01:31:08,378
We were in deep debt.

1036
01:31:08,411 --> 01:31:11,180
'Cause of how he felt about you,

1037
01:31:11,214 --> 01:31:13,182
he had to ask me for help.

1038
01:31:13,216 --> 01:31:16,185
How was I supposed to know
that car was gonna blow?

1039
01:31:16,887 --> 01:31:19,255
A good son would've said no.

1040
01:31:20,189 --> 01:31:22,693
And a real brother
would've come to me.

1041
01:31:22,726 --> 01:31:24,528
Come to you?

1042
01:31:29,265 --> 01:31:32,135
He made me promise
you would never find out.

1043
01:31:32,903 --> 01:31:35,606
And through all of it...

1044
01:31:36,607 --> 01:31:38,274
...I kept that promise.

1045
01:31:45,348 --> 01:31:47,317
The girl comes with me.

1046
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:48,384
Jakob!

1047
01:31:51,522 --> 01:31:53,857
I will stop you.

1048
01:31:53,891 --> 01:31:55,693
And that's my promise.

1049
01:31:59,797 --> 01:32:01,498
Hey!

1050
01:32:06,202 --> 01:32:08,606
Sue. Sue. Ah.

1051
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:10,206
Come on. Come on.

1052
01:32:38,334 --> 01:32:39,603
Down!

1053
01:32:49,546 --> 01:32:50,648
Go! Go!

1054
01:32:50,681 --> 01:32:52,148
Come on!

1055
01:33:02,626 --> 01:33:03,761
This way!

1056
01:33:24,247 --> 01:33:26,416
I'm always here.

1057
01:33:26,449 --> 01:33:27,551
Tell him.

1058
01:33:29,318 --> 01:33:32,489
No...!

1059
01:33:32,523 --> 01:33:34,625
No!

1060
01:34:48,999 --> 01:34:50,466
No!

1061
01:35:09,352 --> 01:35:10,988
<i>Dom.</i>

1062
01:35:11,021 --> 01:35:13,422
<i>Tell me what you see, son.</i>

1063
01:35:20,564 --> 01:35:23,534
See, cars like this
are immortal.

1064
01:35:28,872 --> 01:35:31,642
'70 Chargers are
designed so well

1065
01:35:31,675 --> 01:35:36,079
that if you take care of 'em,
they'll run for 100 years.

1066
01:35:36,113 --> 01:35:37,781
Immortal?

1067
01:35:40,117 --> 01:35:41,919
Just like a family, Dom.

1068
01:35:43,419 --> 01:35:46,389
Build it right,
you take care of it...

1069
01:35:47,524 --> 01:35:48,926
...it'll live beyond you.

1070
01:35:48,959 --> 01:35:51,327
Daddy.

1071
01:35:59,002 --> 01:36:00,436
Little B.

1072
01:36:00,469 --> 01:36:02,773
When are you coming home?

1073
01:36:02,806 --> 01:36:04,708
Com...

1074
01:36:22,526 --> 01:36:25,829
No. You know I'm good for it.
I promise I'll deliver.

1075
01:37:08,872 --> 01:37:10,140
I'm telling you,
I got intermittent miss.

1076
01:37:10,173 --> 01:37:11,842
- Last two laps.
- On it!

1077
01:37:11,875 --> 01:37:13,944
Get those plug wires!

1078
01:37:15,045 --> 01:37:17,948
Jakob! Now.

1079
01:37:42,105 --> 01:37:44,074
You're good!

1080
01:38:01,091 --> 01:38:04,528
No!

1081
01:38:49,339 --> 01:38:51,608
You came to me, Letty.

1082
01:38:51,641 --> 01:38:56,646
None of it is worth a thing
if I lose you.

1083
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:59,116
Do you hear me?

1084
01:39:00,917 --> 01:39:03,120
Is this who we are?

1085
01:39:08,191 --> 01:39:10,060
Yeah.

1086
01:39:14,664 --> 01:39:16,299
From here, things move quickly.

1087
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:18,035
Jakob has all the pieces
he needs.

1088
01:39:18,068 --> 01:39:19,636
Once he activates Aries,

1089
01:39:19,669 --> 01:39:21,204
all he needs to do is
send the signal global.

1090
01:39:21,238 --> 01:39:22,973
And then there's
no stopping him, ever.

1091
01:39:23,006 --> 01:39:25,609
He'll have to launch
some kind of pirate satellite,

1092
01:39:25,642 --> 01:39:27,677
something that'll act
as an amplifier,

1093
01:39:27,711 --> 01:39:30,013
infecting other satellites
in orbit one by one.

1094
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:32,783
So we find him, stop him,
and then we get Elle back.

1095
01:39:32,816 --> 01:39:34,618
Our odds are zero here, Han.

1096
01:39:34,651 --> 01:39:36,586
Satellite equipment is
easy enough to track,

1097
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:38,055
but we're not gonna
beat Jakob to a launch.

1098
01:39:38,088 --> 01:39:40,057
Which gives us
a two-target problem:

1099
01:39:40,090 --> 01:39:41,792
Jakob on the ground...

1100
01:39:41,825 --> 01:39:43,226
With his own private army.

1101
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:45,629
- And the satellite.
- Which can't be hacked.

1102
01:39:45,662 --> 01:39:47,097
Not remotely.
We'd have to do it physically,

1103
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:50,901
50 miles above ground while
the satellite is in orbit.

1104
01:39:50,934 --> 01:39:52,669
Orbit?

1105
01:39:52,702 --> 01:39:54,104
We need help.

1106
01:39:54,137 --> 01:39:56,039
Otherwise, we have no chance.

1107
01:39:56,873 --> 01:39:58,208
We do it ourselves.

1108
01:39:59,142 --> 01:40:02,279
It's where we've been
that got us this far.

1109
01:40:02,312 --> 01:40:04,314
No. No, no, no, no, no.

1110
01:40:04,347 --> 01:40:06,750
Do y'all not understand?

1111
01:40:06,783 --> 01:40:08,218
Clearly, y'all don't.

1112
01:40:08,251 --> 01:40:11,621
Because if you did,
you'd be pissing your pants

1113
01:40:11,655 --> 01:40:12,923
like a normal person.

1114
01:40:12,956 --> 01:40:14,091
Orbit.

1115
01:40:14,124 --> 01:40:15,992
That's outer space.

1116
01:40:16,026 --> 01:40:18,095
That's another level.

1117
01:40:18,128 --> 01:40:21,331
What we gonna do?
Hijack a space shuttle?

1118
01:40:21,364 --> 01:40:22,933
Put rockets on our backs?

1119
01:40:24,401 --> 01:40:26,803
That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

1120
01:40:26,837 --> 01:40:28,138
What?

1121
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:44,654
There goes my father's
diplomatic ties

1122
01:40:44,688 --> 01:40:45,856
with Eastern Europe.

1123
01:40:45,889 --> 01:40:47,224
This place is
going to be crawling

1124
01:40:47,257 --> 01:40:49,226
with every cop in the city.

1125
01:40:49,259 --> 01:40:51,661
Time to get the hell
out of here.

1126
01:41:11,748 --> 01:41:13,049
Keep her close.

1127
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,029
It's activated.

1128
01:41:28,965 --> 01:41:30,467
As soon as the satellite
reaches orbit,

1129
01:41:30,501 --> 01:41:32,836
we start the uplink.

1130
01:41:35,739 --> 01:41:38,208
Ah, damn.

1131
01:41:38,241 --> 01:41:40,343
What?

1132
01:41:40,377 --> 01:41:42,045
You see that?

1133
01:41:42,078 --> 01:41:44,948
We can't have
an air leak, man.

1134
01:41:47,217 --> 01:41:50,187
Are you really patching
yourself up with duct tape?

1135
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:51,354
Yes.

1136
01:41:51,388 --> 01:41:52,989
I don't know
if you noticed or not,

1137
01:41:53,023 --> 01:41:55,392
but this whole operation is
Band-Aids and duct tape.

1138
01:41:55,425 --> 01:41:57,260
Man, this is insane.

1139
01:41:57,294 --> 01:41:59,930
We are headed to outer space.

1140
01:41:59,963 --> 01:42:02,732
You acting like
we on our way to Home Depot.

1141
01:42:02,766 --> 01:42:03,967
This is ridiculous, man.

1142
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,735
I'm about to abort
this whole mission

1143
01:42:05,769 --> 01:42:07,938
and take my Black ass home.

1144
01:42:07,971 --> 01:42:10,473
We're literally gonna be
in a perpetual freefall.

1145
01:42:10,508 --> 01:42:11,474
Freefall?

1146
01:42:11,509 --> 01:42:13,009
What does that even mean?

1147
01:42:13,043 --> 01:42:15,912
Roman, it means
numbers don't lie.

1148
01:42:15,946 --> 01:42:17,881
As long as we obey
the laws of physics,

1149
01:42:17,914 --> 01:42:20,484
then we'll be fine, okay?

1150
01:42:20,518 --> 01:42:22,486
It's just all math and science.

1151
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:24,488
I knew I should've listened
to my teachers.

1152
01:42:24,522 --> 01:42:26,122
Four minutes to launch.

1153
01:42:26,156 --> 01:42:27,891
You fellas good to go?

1154
01:42:29,025 --> 01:42:31,761
Yeah, we just up here putting
a bunch of duct tape on shit.

1155
01:42:31,795 --> 01:42:33,964
You know, that's what Tej do.

1156
01:42:33,997 --> 01:42:36,900
Man, please hurry up so I can
stop hearing his damn mouth.

1157
01:42:36,933 --> 01:42:39,436
- Yes, we're good to go.
- We're not good.

1158
01:42:39,469 --> 01:42:42,239
This is the same car
that we watched

1159
01:42:42,272 --> 01:42:43,840
do a test run and explode.

1160
01:42:43,873 --> 01:42:46,109
- This is not smart, Tej.
- Don't worry, man.

1161
01:42:46,142 --> 01:42:48,912
With my ceramic polymer coating,
you're gonna be just fine.

1162
01:42:48,945 --> 01:42:51,781
You're 100% fireproof.

1163
01:42:52,282 --> 01:42:53,383
Exactly.

1164
01:42:53,416 --> 01:42:55,185
All eight thrusters

1165
01:42:55,218 --> 01:42:56,820
fully functional.

1166
01:42:59,490 --> 01:43:00,991
Hey, please don't tell me

1167
01:43:01,024 --> 01:43:02,993
you're still running
launch simulations.

1168
01:43:03,026 --> 01:43:05,128
Virgin Galactic launched
at 36,000 feet.

1169
01:43:05,161 --> 01:43:07,998
The space shuttle tests
around 50,000 feet.

1170
01:43:08,031 --> 01:43:09,533
Our last test run
with this load means

1171
01:43:09,567 --> 01:43:10,934
we'll have to go higher...
way higher!

1172
01:43:10,967 --> 01:43:12,469
If we don't get them
high enough,

1173
01:43:12,503 --> 01:43:14,271
these guys are gonna be
pancakes at IHOP

1174
01:43:14,304 --> 01:43:16,039
before the coffee
even gets to the table.

1175
01:43:16,072 --> 01:43:17,173
Hey!

1176
01:43:17,207 --> 01:43:18,408
We can still hear you!

1177
01:43:18,441 --> 01:43:20,844
Don't worry, guys. We got this.

1178
01:43:20,877 --> 01:43:22,912
We do got this, right?

1179
01:43:52,342 --> 01:43:54,911
I've run thermal imaging.
Elle's in the armory truck.

1180
01:43:54,944 --> 01:43:56,480
And I've got a lock
on the Aries signal.

1181
01:43:56,514 --> 01:43:57,981
It's coming from
the beast up ahead.

1182
01:43:58,014 --> 01:43:59,316
We need to get in there
to deactivate it

1183
01:43:59,349 --> 01:44:00,950
by the time Roman and Tej
are in position.

1184
01:44:00,984 --> 01:44:03,820
Ramsey, power us up.

1185
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:09,359
Satellite is in low orbit.

1186
01:44:11,094 --> 01:44:12,195
Begin.

1187
01:44:27,977 --> 01:44:30,347
All right,
we're passing 50,000 feet!

1188
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:32,215
Time to get ready, boys.

1189
01:44:32,248 --> 01:44:33,983
What we supposed to be doing

1190
01:44:34,017 --> 01:44:36,353
with these old-ass suits

1191
01:44:36,386 --> 01:44:38,355
that ain't been used
since World War I?

1192
01:44:38,388 --> 01:44:39,956
Oh, I'm sorry.

1193
01:44:39,989 --> 01:44:42,959
Astronauts "R" Us was closed
for shopping today.

1194
01:44:42,992 --> 01:44:45,629
Listen, these suits are
just like space suits.

1195
01:44:45,663 --> 01:44:47,565
They both account
for pressure differential.

1196
01:44:47,598 --> 01:44:49,132
Only thing is we may

1197
01:44:49,165 --> 01:44:51,201
blow up like balloons
just a little bit.

1198
01:44:51,234 --> 01:44:52,570
- That's the only difference.
- What?

1199
01:44:52,603 --> 01:44:54,204
We just hit
the launch altitude.

1200
01:44:54,237 --> 01:44:56,339
- You guys ready for a five count?
- No, man!

1201
01:44:56,373 --> 01:45:00,009
I'm barely ready to go scuba
diving in this old-ass thing.

1202
01:45:00,043 --> 01:45:01,512
Don't listen to him. We ready!

1203
01:45:01,545 --> 01:45:02,979
- "We"?
- Yes, I said "we"!

1204
01:45:03,012 --> 01:45:04,381
I thought you was invincible.

1205
01:45:04,414 --> 01:45:07,050
Let's see how invincible
your Black ass is after this.

1206
01:45:07,083 --> 01:45:09,052
- Punch it!
- No! Tej!

1207
01:45:12,155 --> 01:45:14,658
Oh, my God!
I don't want to die!

1208
01:45:14,692 --> 01:45:16,893
Ignition!

1209
01:46:00,604 --> 01:46:04,207
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1210
01:46:07,678 --> 01:46:09,513
We're in outer space!

1211
01:46:10,581 --> 01:46:13,651
Told you numbers don't lie.

1212
01:46:13,684 --> 01:46:16,085
This is crazy, bro!

1213
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:29,065
Man, how much candy did you eat?

1214
01:46:29,098 --> 01:46:32,135
Well, I-I... I eat candy
when I get nervous.

1215
01:46:41,377 --> 01:46:43,581
I thought you said
you took care of this.

1216
01:46:45,248 --> 01:46:47,083
Yeah. Hey.

1217
01:46:47,116 --> 01:46:50,420
You take them back to the
freaking junkyard right now!

1218
01:48:25,683 --> 01:48:27,484
All right, Han, Mia, you're up!

1219
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:42,398
Now.

1220
01:48:47,805 --> 01:48:49,707
Letty.

1221
01:49:09,493 --> 01:49:10,694
Han!

1222
01:50:08,786 --> 01:50:10,554
Not all of us.

1223
01:50:23,867 --> 01:50:27,504
Now, the satellite we looking
for should be somewhere...

1224
01:50:27,538 --> 01:50:29,238
There.

1225
01:50:29,272 --> 01:50:30,574
Right there. You see it?

1226
01:50:30,607 --> 01:50:31,909
Got it.

1227
01:50:31,942 --> 01:50:34,310
Tell me you know
how to work the thrusters.

1228
01:50:34,343 --> 01:50:37,815
Tej, numbers is
what you do, right?

1229
01:50:38,782 --> 01:50:41,217
Driving is what I do.

1230
01:50:47,624 --> 01:50:51,294
Two dudes from the ghetto...
outer space.

1231
01:50:52,763 --> 01:50:54,898
You know ain't nobody
gonna believe us, right?

1232
01:50:54,932 --> 01:50:57,467
You're right.

1233
01:51:05,441 --> 01:51:07,410
Something's wrong with
the satellite array.

1234
01:51:07,443 --> 01:51:10,214
It's, uh, interfering
with the uplink.

1235
01:51:12,381 --> 01:51:14,485
I'll handle it.

1236
01:51:32,069 --> 01:51:33,469
Han?

1237
01:51:34,638 --> 01:51:36,607
Grab the wheel.

1238
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:37,841
Something's up.

1239
01:51:39,476 --> 01:51:41,812
I think I can link
into their feed.

1240
01:51:53,757 --> 01:51:56,392
- Something you want to tell me, Otto?
- My bad.

1241
01:51:56,425 --> 01:51:59,395
Satellite uplink is
actually going splendid.

1242
01:51:59,428 --> 01:52:01,999
Oh, and by the way,
I have a new business partner.

1243
01:52:02,032 --> 01:52:04,034
Maybe you know her.

1244
01:52:04,067 --> 01:52:06,970
Guess who's
out of the box, Jakob.

1245
01:52:07,004 --> 01:52:09,405
But I did try to warn you.

1246
01:52:11,542 --> 01:52:13,644
You were never my competition.

1247
01:52:13,677 --> 01:52:16,547
- Otto, there's something you should know.
- Yeah, go on.

1248
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:18,682
- Lay it on me, dude.
- You're a spoiled rich prick,

1249
01:52:18,715 --> 01:52:21,450
- and I'm gonna kill you.
- Oh, man, I am so sorry.

1250
01:52:21,485 --> 01:52:23,120
No one told you, huh?

1251
01:52:23,153 --> 01:52:27,558
Spoiled rich pricks
run the world.

1252
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:53,677
Come on. Come on!

1253
01:54:12,062 --> 01:54:13,563
Go.

1254
01:54:52,869 --> 01:54:54,871
- What's happening?
- Uh, well,

1255
01:54:54,905 --> 01:54:58,542
we appear to have lost
our escort and Jakob.

1256
01:54:58,575 --> 01:54:59,977
And, well, Dom is making things

1257
01:55:00,010 --> 01:55:01,812
a little bit difficult here,
but it's fine.

1258
01:55:01,845 --> 01:55:03,981
Really, it's peachy.
Don't worry, don't worry.

1259
01:55:04,014 --> 01:55:05,749
I'll finish this myself.

1260
01:55:09,753 --> 01:55:12,789
All right, let's see
what that beast is made of.

1261
01:55:12,823 --> 01:55:13,991
You ready, Elle?

1262
01:55:27,137 --> 01:55:28,839
Crank it.

1263
01:55:28,872 --> 01:55:31,074
If we can't break through,
we stop it.

1264
01:56:01,905 --> 01:56:04,274
Guys, that thing is
not slowing down

1265
01:56:04,307 --> 01:56:05,876
and the download's almost done.

1266
01:56:05,909 --> 01:56:09,546
Dom, we don't get
out of here now, we're dead.

1267
01:56:18,221 --> 01:56:20,791
Letty, drop back and line up
with the front tires.

1268
01:56:20,824 --> 01:56:21,858
What?

1269
01:56:21,892 --> 01:56:23,794
If we can't slow it
and we can't punch through,

1270
01:56:23,827 --> 01:56:25,929
we flip it
and we hit the underside.

1271
01:56:25,962 --> 01:56:28,965
Goddamn it!
Why do I have to say this?

1272
01:56:28,999 --> 01:56:30,767
Flatten these clowns!

1273
01:56:48,919 --> 01:56:50,821
- Letty, the wires.
- You read my mind.

1274
01:56:50,854 --> 01:56:52,789
Han, get in front of me.

1275
01:56:54,424 --> 01:56:56,860
Dom, I can't get to you.

1276
01:56:57,694 --> 01:56:59,162
But I can.

1277
01:58:14,404 --> 01:58:16,773
All right,
the satellite is in range.

1278
01:58:16,806 --> 01:58:18,476
Let's power up these magnets
and fry it.

1279
01:58:18,509 --> 01:58:20,177
All right, take our time.

1280
01:58:30,453 --> 01:58:32,155
Okay. All right.

1281
01:58:33,757 --> 01:58:36,393
- Tej!
- Hold on. Come on, baby.

1282
01:58:36,426 --> 01:58:38,228
Power up. Power up.

1283
01:58:40,964 --> 01:58:42,199
Shit.

1284
01:58:42,232 --> 01:58:44,502
- Shit, shit, shit.
- What?

1285
01:58:44,535 --> 01:58:46,236
Talk to me. What's going on?

1286
01:58:46,269 --> 01:58:48,405
The pressure of the launch...
it must have jammed the cables

1287
01:58:48,438 --> 01:58:50,073
to the power source.

1288
01:58:50,106 --> 01:58:53,343
Damn it, how did I
not think of that?

1289
01:58:53,376 --> 01:58:55,345
Guys, where are you?

1290
01:58:55,378 --> 01:58:58,748
The upload is almost complete.

1291
01:58:58,782 --> 01:59:01,485
Why don't you just kill it?

1292
01:59:01,519 --> 01:59:03,353
Let's smash it.
Let's run it over, right?

1293
01:59:03,386 --> 01:59:07,757
No. If we crash into that
satellite, we'll probably die.

1294
01:59:07,791 --> 01:59:09,092
And even if we don't,

1295
01:59:09,125 --> 01:59:11,261
the fuel that it would take
to smash it...

1296
01:59:11,294 --> 01:59:13,463
we'd be stuck out here forever.

1297
01:59:13,497 --> 01:59:15,232
You got to have faith, bro.

1298
01:59:15,265 --> 01:59:17,867
Faith? Faith is not numbers.

1299
01:59:17,901 --> 01:59:19,903
You know what, Tej?

1300
01:59:20,904 --> 01:59:22,472
You're probably right.

1301
01:59:25,008 --> 01:59:26,910
<i>We're not invincible.</i>

1302
01:59:28,979 --> 01:59:32,983
<i>We probably just been lucky
this whole time.</i>

1303
01:59:38,489 --> 01:59:40,790
<i>This might be it.</i>

1304
01:59:43,159 --> 01:59:45,829
<i>But you know what?</i>

1305
01:59:45,862 --> 01:59:47,330
<i>If we're gonna go out...</i>

1306
01:59:49,132 --> 01:59:51,401
...let's go out
on top of the world.

1307
01:59:52,335 --> 01:59:54,572
Guys,
what's happening up there?

1308
01:59:54,605 --> 01:59:57,007
We've got seconds left.

1309
01:59:58,509 --> 02:00:00,410
Let's do it.

1310
02:00:00,443 --> 02:00:01,878
Let's go.

1311
02:00:06,383 --> 02:00:09,419
Five, four, three,

1312
02:00:09,452 --> 02:00:11,888
two, one.

1313
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:31,575
We did it.

1314
02:00:31,609 --> 02:00:33,343
We did it!

1315
02:00:33,376 --> 02:00:35,211
Let's go.

1316
02:00:35,245 --> 02:00:36,547
Yes!

1317
02:00:36,580 --> 02:00:38,582
Shit.

1318
02:00:38,616 --> 02:00:40,250
Not bad, man.

1319
02:00:40,283 --> 02:00:41,951
Not bad at all.

1320
02:00:53,463 --> 02:00:56,099
Hold on!

1321
02:01:03,406 --> 02:01:04,441
Dom!

1322
02:01:57,293 --> 02:01:59,429
Yes!

1323
02:02:04,968 --> 02:02:07,003
Got to be kidding me.

1324
02:02:41,539 --> 02:02:43,339
Shit!

1325
02:03:35,626 --> 02:03:37,994
Think these belong to you.

1326
02:03:46,570 --> 02:03:50,340
There's gonna be a lot of
people coming after you, Jake.

1327
02:03:50,373 --> 02:03:52,308
Yeah.

1328
02:03:52,342 --> 02:03:54,344
This is the world I chose, Dom.

1329
02:03:56,079 --> 02:03:59,148
You know, Dad wasn't perfect.

1330
02:03:59,182 --> 02:04:02,018
And he loved us all the same.

1331
02:04:05,121 --> 02:04:08,726
Someone once gave me
a ten-second car...

1332
02:04:08,759 --> 02:04:11,127
as a second chance.

1333
02:04:12,428 --> 02:04:15,098
I owe you that, little brother.

1334
02:04:28,111 --> 02:04:30,481
I lost you once.

1335
02:04:30,514 --> 02:04:32,583
Don't let that
happen again, okay?

1336
02:05:13,490 --> 02:05:16,359
We come in peace!

1337
02:05:16,392 --> 02:05:18,227
Hey!

1338
02:05:46,255 --> 02:05:49,225
This was the last place
I saw your grandfather.

1339
02:05:50,928 --> 02:05:52,630
This is where he raced.

1340
02:05:52,663 --> 02:05:55,298
Did you race here, too, Daddy?

1341
02:05:55,331 --> 02:05:56,232
No.

1342
02:05:56,265 --> 02:05:58,502
But I'll tell you something.

1343
02:06:00,436 --> 02:06:02,573
Everything I needed
to know about life,

1344
02:06:02,606 --> 02:06:03,941
I learned on this track.

1345
02:06:03,974 --> 02:06:05,542
You did?

1346
02:06:06,543 --> 02:06:07,945
I did.

1347
02:06:50,453 --> 02:06:53,624
It's all gonna be okay, Jakob.

1348
02:06:57,260 --> 02:06:59,462
We got some rough times ahead...

1349
02:07:01,498 --> 02:07:03,701
...but it's gonna be okay.

1350
02:07:05,736 --> 02:07:07,571
'Cause we're family.

1351
02:07:32,896 --> 02:07:34,998
- Fellas.
- Hey.

1352
02:07:39,970 --> 02:07:41,905
What?

1353
02:07:41,939 --> 02:07:44,641
No way.

1354
02:07:55,318 --> 02:07:57,521
What's going on?

1355
02:07:58,622 --> 02:08:01,759
I couldn't believe it
when I heard you were alive.

1356
02:08:06,063 --> 02:08:08,364
It's a long story.

1357
02:08:09,398 --> 02:08:11,869
But for now, let's just
enjoy the moment, huh?

1358
02:08:11,902 --> 02:08:13,469
Guys, this is Elle.

1359
02:08:13,504 --> 02:08:15,606
Hey, Elle. I'm Sean.

1360
02:08:15,639 --> 02:08:17,541
Just call me T.

1361
02:08:17,574 --> 02:08:19,543
- I'm Earl.
- Nice to meet you.

1362
02:08:20,544 --> 02:08:22,345
Mia.

1363
02:08:25,949 --> 02:08:28,284
Hi. Nice to finally meet you.

1364
02:08:37,027 --> 02:08:39,530
- Hey, guys.
- Mm. - Hey.

1365
02:08:39,563 --> 02:08:41,598
How much longer on this food?

1366
02:08:41,632 --> 02:08:44,400
Like, I'm-I'm...
I'm ready to eat now.

1367
02:08:44,433 --> 02:08:46,737
I've been eating space food
for weeks.

1368
02:08:46,770 --> 02:08:50,107
Oh. So Tootsie Rolls
are space food?

1369
02:08:50,140 --> 02:08:51,474
'Cause that's all you ate.

1370
02:08:51,508 --> 02:08:53,076
It was fat free, bruh.

1371
02:08:53,110 --> 02:08:54,645
Snickers and Twix
fat free, too?

1372
02:08:54,678 --> 02:08:56,547
- My forehead hungry.
- Yeah, okay.

1373
02:08:56,580 --> 02:08:57,948
- I'll see you later.
- Y-Your forehead is overweight.

1374
02:08:59,448 --> 02:09:00,851
Oh!

1375
02:09:01,852 --> 02:09:04,721
You drive just like your dad.

1376
02:09:04,755 --> 02:09:07,758
- I do?
- Mm-hmm.

1377
02:09:07,791 --> 02:09:09,693
Do you know, this is...

1378
02:09:09,726 --> 02:09:12,129
this is where I met your mom
for the first time.

1379
02:09:12,162 --> 02:09:13,964
Right there.

1380
02:09:13,997 --> 02:09:16,133
She's watching over you
from heaven.

1381
02:09:16,166 --> 02:09:18,602
- She is?
- Mm-hmm.

1382
02:09:21,138 --> 02:09:23,774
I think Daddy has
a question for you.

1383
02:09:28,011 --> 02:09:30,080
You ready to say grace, kid?

1384
02:09:30,113 --> 02:09:32,448
But I don't know what to say.

1385
02:09:33,083 --> 02:09:34,685
Oh, it's easy.

1386
02:09:35,719 --> 02:09:37,921
Just say whatever's
in your heart.

1387
02:09:37,955 --> 02:09:38,989
You ready?

1388
02:09:39,022 --> 02:09:40,456
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on.

1389
02:09:47,164 --> 02:09:48,732
Hey, guys.

1390
02:09:48,765 --> 02:09:50,767
Hey.

1391
02:09:50,801 --> 02:09:52,936
Little Brian's ready
to say grace with us.

1392
02:09:52,970 --> 02:09:55,404
- Uh-huh.
- Nice.

1393
02:09:55,438 --> 02:09:57,541
Now, hold on.

1394
02:09:57,574 --> 02:09:59,543
There's still an empty chair.

1395
02:10:00,177 --> 02:10:01,511
He's on the way.

1396
02:13:01,158 --> 02:13:02,993
Thank you.

1397
02:13:03,026 --> 02:13:04,661
Please.

1398
02:13:04,694 --> 02:13:06,329
I tell you where the drive is,
the plans we stole.

1399
02:13:06,363 --> 02:13:07,931
I tell you where it is.

1400
02:13:07,964 --> 02:13:09,599
You mean this drive?

1401
02:13:10,233 --> 02:13:11,902
These plans?

1402
02:13:13,403 --> 02:13:15,338
But you already got it.

1403
02:13:15,372 --> 02:13:17,174
Yes, mate.

1404
02:13:17,207 --> 02:13:19,643
How else do you think
I stay in this good of shape?

1405
02:13:25,315 --> 02:13:27,150
Don't go anywhere.

1406
