1
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:18,814
<i>You ready?</i>

2
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,047
<i>No, just... Yeah, just-just
ignore the microphone.</i>

3
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,055
<i>Yeah, just-just act as if
it's not there.</i>

4
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:26,756
<i>Sing as if it's not there.</i>

5
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:30,461
<i>Yeah, uh...</i>

6
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:40,030
<i>Okay?</i>

7
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:45,577
- Ready for them?
- Yes.

8
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:46,853
Let's go.

9
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,763
<i>If you're here,
then you already know</i>

10
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,199
<i>who she is, and that is one
of the most important</i>

11
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:01,596
<i>musical figures of our time.</i>

12
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:03,660
<i>Lydia Tár is many things:</i>

13
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:07,097
<i>a piano performance graduate
at the Curtis Institute,</i>

14
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:09,602
<i>Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard.</i>

15
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:13,777
<i>She got her PhD in Musicology
from the University of Vienna,</i>

16
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:16,374
<i>specializing in
the indigenous music</i>

17
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,350
<i>of the Ucayali Valley
in Eastern Peru,</i>

18
00:06:19,486 --> 00:06:21,386
<i>where she spent five years</i>

19
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:23,380
<i>among the Shipibo-Konibo peopl.</i>

20
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:27,018
<i>As a conductor,
Tár began her career</i>

21
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,385
<i>with the Cleveland Orchestra,</i>

22
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,992
<i>one of the so-called
"Big Five."</i>

23
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:32,291
<i>A string of
important posts followed,</i>

24
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,794
<i>including
the Philadelphia Orchestra,</i>

25
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:36,159
<i>the Chicago Symphony Orchestra,</i>

26
00:06:36,294 --> 00:06:37,501
<i>the Boston Symphony Orchestra,</i>

27
00:06:37,636 --> 00:06:39,406
<i>until she at last arrived here</i>

28
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:42,506
<i>at our own
New York Philharmonic.</i>

29
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:43,973
<i>With the latter, she organized</i>

30
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:46,580
<i>the Highway 10
refugee concerts in Zaatari,</i>

31
00:06:46,715 --> 00:06:50,979
<i>which were attended
by over 75,000 people.</i>

32
00:06:51,115 --> 00:06:52,651
<i>She's become particularly
well-known</i>

33
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,479
<i>for commissioning
contemporary work</i>

34
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:57,689
<i>from, among others,
Jennifer Higdon, Caroline Shaw,</i>

35
00:06:57,824 --> 00:07:00,155
<i>Julia Wolfe
and Hildur Gudnadóttir.</i>

36
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,321
<i>And she's made a point
of programming their works</i>

37
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,398
<i>alongside composers
of the canon.</i>

38
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:07,832
<i>She's been quoted as saying,</i>

39
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:10,669
<i>"These composers
are having a conversation</i>

40
00:07:10,804 --> 00:07:13,665
<i>and it may not always
be so polite."</i>

41
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,273
<i>Lydia Tár has also written
music for the stage and screen.</i>

42
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:21,012
<i>She is in fact one of only 15
so-called EGOTs, meaning those</i>

43
00:07:21,147 --> 00:07:25,344
<i>who have won all four
major entertainment awards:</i>

44
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,013
<i>an Emmy, a Grammy,
an Oscar and a Tony.</i>

45
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,591
<i>It is, as you can imagine,</i>

46
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:33,055
<i>an extremely short
and shimmering list</i>

47
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:36,224
<i>that includes Richard Rodgers,
Audrey Hepburn,</i>

48
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,133
<i>Andrew Lloyd Webber
and, of course, Mel Brooks.</i>

49
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:47,365
In 2010, with
the support of Eliot Kaplan,

50
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:50,371
she founded the Accordion
Conducting Fellowship,

51
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:53,404
which fosters entrepreneurship
and performance opportunities

52
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,616
for female conductors,
allowing them residencies

53
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:59,544
with major orchestras
around the world.

54
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,653
In 2013, Berlin elected Tár
as its principal conductor,

55
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:07,251
in succession to Andris Davis,

56
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:10,221
and she's remained there
ever since.

57
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,060
Like her mentor,
Leonard Bernstein,

58
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:15,226
Tár has a particular
affinity for Mahler,

59
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,402
whose nine symphonies
she recorded

60
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:19,696
during her Big Five stints.

61
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,171
However, she never managed
to complete

62
00:08:22,307 --> 00:08:25,903
the so-called "cycle" with
a single orchestra until now.

63
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,308
Under her direction,

64
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:29,408
Berlin has recorded eight
of the Mahler symphonies,

65
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:32,244
saving the big one,
Symphony No. 5, for last.

66
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,314
Due to the pandemic,
that performance,

67
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,081
which was scheduled for
last year, had to be canceled.

68
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:38,923
But I'm told that next month,

69
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:41,624
she'll make a live recording
of Mahler's Fifth,

70
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,257
which will complete the cycle

71
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:46,928
and will be issued in a box set
by Deutsche Grammophon

72
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:49,099
just in time
for Mahler's birthday.

73
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:52,970
As if that's not enough,
her new book,<i> Tár on Tár,</i>

74
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:56,766
will be published by Nan
Talese's imprint at Doubleday,

75
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:59,943
just in time for Christmas,
a perfect stocking stuffer,

76
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,346
especially if you have
a very large stocking.

77
00:09:04,016 --> 00:09:05,552
All of us at<i> The New Yorker</i>
welcome you.

78
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:07,386
Thank you for joining us,
Maestro, today.

79
00:09:07,521 --> 00:09:09,213
Thank you, Adam. Thank you.

80
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,823
Thank you.

81
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,059
Lydia, I couldn't...

82
00:09:15,194 --> 00:09:18,396
I couldn't help but see you
flinch just a little bit

83
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:20,030
as I was reading your bio.

84
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:22,129
Was it because I forgot
some other amazing achievement?

85
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:24,636
Or do you have
a slight self-consciousness

86
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,800
about the incredibly
varied things

87
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:28,841
that you've accomplished?

88
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:33,975
Well, in today's world,
"varied," it-it's a dirty word.

89
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:36,079
I mean,
our era is one of specialists,

90
00:09:36,214 --> 00:09:39,013
and if you're trying to do
more than one thing,

91
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:40,815
it's, you know,
it's often frowned upon.

92
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,420
Every artist gets typecast.

93
00:09:42,556 --> 00:09:43,922
Oh, yes. Aggressively so.

94
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:45,690
Well, do you think there'll be
a moment, though,

95
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:47,859
when the classical music
community,

96
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:51,330
uh, decides not to use
sexual distinctions

97
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,500
to differentiate artists?

98
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,700
I'm probably
the wrong person to ask

99
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:58,161
since I don't, uh, read reviews.

100
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,730
- Never, really?
- No.

101
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:03,941
But it is odd, I-I think,
that anyone ever felt compelled

102
00:10:04,076 --> 00:10:06,913
to substitute
"maestro" with "maestra."

103
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:10,244
I mean, we don't call women
astronauts "astronettes."

104
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:12,015
Mm-hmm. Right.

105
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,788
But as to the question
of, uh, gender bias,

106
00:10:15,923 --> 00:10:18,353
I really have nothing
to complain about.

107
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:21,519
Nor, for that matter, should
Marin Alsop, JoAnn Falletta,

108
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,795
uh, Laurence Equilbey
and Nathalie Stutzmann.

109
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,562
I mean, there's so many
incredible women

110
00:10:26,698 --> 00:10:28,031
who came before us.

111
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,467
You know, women who did
the-the real lifting.

112
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:31,701
That-that's fascinating.

113
00:10:31,837 --> 00:10:33,700
Can you... Who, for instance?

114
00:10:33,835 --> 00:10:34,938
Uh, okay, sure.

115
00:10:35,073 --> 00:10:37,139
Uh, first and foremost,
Nadia Boulanger.

116
00:10:37,274 --> 00:10:40,107
I mean, that would be
the, uh, happy example.

117
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:43,377
Uh, the sad one would be
Antonia Brico,

118
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:46,281
who by all accounts
was an incredible conductor

119
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,652
but was ghettoized
into the non glamorous status

120
00:10:49,787 --> 00:10:51,723
of a "guest conductor"

121
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,627
and essentially
treated as a dog act.

122
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:56,890
A dog...
Uh, she never got the chance

123
00:10:57,026 --> 00:10:58,060
to lead a major orchestra?

124
00:10:58,195 --> 00:11:00,130
Well, yes.
Yes, she did, uh, conduct

125
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:02,559
the, uh, Berlin Philharmonic,
as well as the Met,

126
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,728
but, again,
only as a guest conductor.

127
00:11:05,864 --> 00:11:07,572
You know, at, I mean,
at that time it was...

128
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:09,838
it was all gender spectacle.

129
00:11:09,974 --> 00:11:11,502
But fortunately, times change,

130
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,242
and-and the Pauline
conversion is...

131
00:11:13,377 --> 00:11:15,075
- "Pauline..."
- ...if not complete,

132
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,750
then it's-it's evolving nicely.

133
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,410
N-No less, um,
having fallen off its horse.

134
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,686
Um, Lydia, could we talk
a little bit

135
00:11:21,821 --> 00:11:23,821
- about, uh, translation?
- Mm-hmm.

136
00:11:23,957 --> 00:11:25,453
'Cause I think
there's still people

137
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:28,960
who think of the conductor
as a kind of human metronome.

138
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:32,864
Well, yeah,
that's-that's partly true.

139
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,697
- Yeah, but it's...
- But keeping time,

140
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,265
it's-it's no small thing.

141
00:11:36,401 --> 00:11:38,462
But I suspect there's
a lot more to it than that.

142
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:39,968
Yeah, well,
I-I would hope so, yes.

143
00:11:40,104 --> 00:11:42,766
- But time is the thing.
- Uh-huh.

144
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,974
Time is-is the essential piece
of, uh, interpretation.

145
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:48,776
You cannot start without me.

146
00:11:48,912 --> 00:11:50,850
See, I start the clock.

147
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:54,283
Now, my left hand shapes,
but my right hand,

148
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:58,783
the second hand, marks time
and moves it forward.

149
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:02,660
However, unlike a clock,
sometimes my second hand stops,

150
00:12:02,795 --> 00:12:05,798
which means that time stops.

151
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,968
Now, the illusion is that,
like you,

152
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,204
I'm responding to
the orchestra in real time...

153
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,464
- Right, right.
- ...making the decision about the right moment

154
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,973
to restart the thing,
or reset it,

155
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:17,801
or throw time out
the window altogether.

156
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,977
The reality is that right
from the very beginning,

157
00:12:21,112 --> 00:12:23,080
I know precisely
what time it is...

158
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:25,018
- Really? That's...
- ...and the exact moment

159
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:28,019
that you and I will arrive
at our destination together.

160
00:12:28,154 --> 00:12:31,686
You know, the only real,
uh, discovery for me

161
00:12:31,821 --> 00:12:33,583
is in rehearsal.

162
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,490
It's never,
never in performance.

163
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:39,524
Hard question, I know, but
if you could define one thing

164
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,528
that Bernstein gave you,
what would it be?

165
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:45,770
Kavvanah.

166
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:47,102
Yeah, it's-it's the Hebrew word

167
00:12:47,238 --> 00:12:50,041
for attention to meaning
or-or intent.

168
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:51,903
You know, what are
the composer's priorities,

169
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,178
and what are yours, and how do
they complement one another?

170
00:12:54,313 --> 00:12:56,181
Right, kavvanah. I think
that's a word that will have

171
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,381
a slightly different meaning
for many in our audience.

172
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:01,721
Well, yes, yes, I imagine so.

173
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:03,087
Am I right in thinking
that a conductor

174
00:13:03,222 --> 00:13:05,858
was not always, uh,
an onstage presence

175
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,290
- in classical music?
- No, that's right.

176
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:09,359
I-I think I read someplace
that it actually was

177
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:11,427
the first violin, for a long
time, who was responsible.

178
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:14,258
Yes, the first violinist,
whether they had any interest

179
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:15,858
or-or skill in it or not.

180
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:18,697
Wh-When did that change,
and-and who changed it?

181
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:21,865
With the French composer,
Jean-Baptiste Lully,

182
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,870
who reportedly, uh,
used a, uh, rather enormous,

183
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:29,879
rather pointy staff to pound
the tempi into the floor.

184
00:13:30,014 --> 00:13:31,148
It's not something I imagine

185
00:13:31,283 --> 00:13:33,614
the players particularly,
uh, appreciated.

186
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,555
Uh, anyway, uh, that technique
ended during a performance

187
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,554
when Lully accidentally

188
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:41,885
stabbed himself in the foot
with the thing and died.

189
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,726
Yeah, of-of-of gangrene.

190
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:46,631
But anyway...

191
00:13:46,766 --> 00:13:49,502
Yeah.

192
00:13:49,638 --> 00:13:52,896
Anyway, but the conductor

193
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:56,633
really becomes essential
as the ensembles get bigger.

194
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,177
And once again,
we go back to Beethoven.

195
00:13:59,312 --> 00:14:02,245
♪ Buh, buh, buh, bum,
buh, buh, buh, bum. ♪

196
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,279
Now, that doesn't start
with the eighth note.

197
00:14:04,414 --> 00:14:06,848
The downbeat...
♪ Buh, buh, buh ♪...

198
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:08,645
It's silent, right?

199
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,156
So someone had to start
that clock.

200
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,155
Someone had to, uh,
plant their flag in the sand

201
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,855
and say, "Follow me," you know?

202
00:14:16,991 --> 00:14:20,263
And when that someone was
Lenny, the orchestra was led

203
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,432
on the most extraordinary
tour of pleasures.

204
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:27,497
'Cause he knew the music,
Mahler especially,

205
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,633
as well or better than anyone.

206
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,944
And he would often play
with the form.

207
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,342
'Cause he wanted an orchestra
to feel

208
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:36,607
that they had never seen,
let alone heard

209
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,610
or-or performed
any of that music.

210
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,887
So he-he would do
radical things,

211
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:44,154
like, uh, disregarding
the tempo primo

212
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,683
or-or ending this phrase
molto ritardando,

213
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,320
even though
it had no such marking.

214
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,696
Was he over-egging it?

215
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:52,197
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all.

216
00:14:52,332 --> 00:14:55,998
He, he, he celebrated the joy
of his discovery.

217
00:14:56,134 --> 00:14:57,532
You just told us a moment ago

218
00:14:57,667 --> 00:15:00,039
that your discovery
takes place in rehearsal.

219
00:15:00,174 --> 00:15:02,668
When will that process
begin again for you?

220
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:04,907
We start on Monday.

221
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:06,879
- Immediately?
- Mm.

222
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:09,314
With this one,
it really is about

223
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,843
trying to read the tea leaves
of-of Mahler's intention.

224
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,478
I mean, we know a great deal
about this

225
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,146
with his other symphonies.

226
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:19,389
You know, he was so inspired
by the poetry of Rückert

227
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:21,828
that for years he didn't set
another author to music.

228
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,828
But all of this changes
with the Five.

229
00:15:24,963 --> 00:15:27,161
The Five is a mystery.

230
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:29,936
And the only clue he leaves us

231
00:15:30,072 --> 00:15:32,004
is on the cover
of the manuscript itself.

232
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,008
Yes, the-the dedication
to his new wife, Alma.

233
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,007
So if you're gonna partner
with Mahler

234
00:15:38,142 --> 00:15:40,845
on his, uh, fifth symphony,

235
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,379
the first thing you must do

236
00:15:42,514 --> 00:15:46,846
is try to understand
that very complex marriage.

237
00:15:46,982 --> 00:15:49,714
And would you say that you have
a different interpretation

238
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:52,157
of that marriage
than Bernstein did?

239
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:58,126
You mentioned my ethnographic
fieldwork in the Amazon.

240
00:15:58,262 --> 00:16:00,933
Well, Adam, the Shipibo-Konibo

241
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:03,703
only receive an<i> icaro,</i> or song,

242
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,436
if the singer is there, right?

243
00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:09,308
On the same side of the-the
spirit that-that created it.

244
00:16:09,443 --> 00:16:12,903
And in that way, the past
and the present converge.

245
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:16,413
It's the flip sides
of the same cosmic coin.

246
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:19,413
That definition of fidelity
makes sense to me.

247
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:21,944
But Lenny,
he believed in<i> teshuvah.</i>

248
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,387
The Talmudic power
to reach back into time

249
00:16:24,522 --> 00:16:27,384
and-and transform
the, uh, significance

250
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,954
of one's past deeds.

251
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:33,094
So when he played the Adagietto
at Robert Kennedy's funeral,

252
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:35,266
it ran for 12 minutes.

253
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:37,731
He treated it as a mass.

254
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,568
And, you know, if you listen
to a recording of it,

255
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:43,338
you will no doubt feel
the tragedy and-and the pathos.

256
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:46,011
And of course
that, uh, interpretation

257
00:16:46,147 --> 00:16:48,147
was very true for Mahler
later in life,

258
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:50,246
after the professional bottom
dropped out

259
00:16:50,382 --> 00:16:52,316
and Alma had left him
for Gropius.

260
00:16:52,452 --> 00:16:57,586
But, as I said before,
we are dealing with time.

261
00:16:57,721 --> 00:17:02,157
And this piece was not born
into aching tragedy.

262
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:04,597
It was born into young love.

263
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,861
And so you chose...

264
00:17:06,996 --> 00:17:08,432
Love.

265
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:11,462
Right, but precisely how long?

266
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,868
Well...

267
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:14,936
seven minutes.

268
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,978
I was so taken
by what you said to Adam

269
00:17:22,114 --> 00:17:25,279
about, um, interpretation

270
00:17:25,414 --> 00:17:28,786
and specifically about feelings,

271
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,181
and that you chose love.

272
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,517
And I know it's said
that you should leave the tears

273
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,624
for the audience, but...

274
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,394
do you ever find yourself
overwhelmed by emotion

275
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,130
when you're up there
at the podium?

276
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:43,032
Yes.

277
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,995
Yes, that does happen.

278
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,139
There's an...
an expectation-reward cycle

279
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,243
with some works
and the spots in them

280
00:17:50,378 --> 00:17:53,177
that I find so incredible,
that when I'm conducting,

281
00:17:53,313 --> 00:17:55,578
it's not that
I'm rushing exactly,

282
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:58,316
but, oh, I just can't wait
to get to that spot,

283
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,751
and, yeah, it does it.
It does it every time.

284
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:04,320
So it's physical
as well as emotional.

285
00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:06,320
- Hmm. Hmm.
- God, it must take hours

286
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:08,559
to come back down to earth.

287
00:18:08,694 --> 00:18:12,029
You say things after others
remember, but you won't.

288
00:18:12,164 --> 00:18:14,265
And sleep, it's impossible.

289
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,393
It's like my freshman year
at Smith.

290
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,497
Which piece does that to you?

291
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,934
Oh, I saw you.

292
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,206
I saw you conduct, uh,
<i>The Rite of Spring</i>

293
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:26,712
at the Met last year.

294
00:18:26,848 --> 00:18:28,839
It was so powerful.

295
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,017
Thank you. Thank you.

296
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,017
It's...
It's the 11 pistol shots...

297
00:18:34,152 --> 00:18:35,386
It's a prime number...

298
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:37,881
That strike you as both victim
and perpetrator.

299
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,457
You know, it's not until
I conducted it

300
00:18:39,592 --> 00:18:43,196
that I became convinced
we're all capable of murder.

301
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,955
That is a fantastic handbag,
by the way.

302
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,524
Thank you.
I'm glad you like it.

303
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:50,127
Oh, I do. I do.

304
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,035
Sorry.
Your lunch with Mr. Kaplan.

305
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,771
His driver is waiting.

306
00:18:53,906 --> 00:18:55,031
All right.

307
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,207
I-I'm sorry,
I've forgotten your name.

308
00:18:56,342 --> 00:18:57,809
- Whitney. Whitney Reese.
- Whitney.

309
00:18:57,945 --> 00:18:58,942
Whitney, of course.

310
00:18:59,077 --> 00:19:00,445
I'm, I'm so sorry,

311
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,138
and unfortunately
I've left things a bit late

312
00:19:02,273 --> 00:19:03,539
- and there's something I can't get out of.
- Oh.

313
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,716
I understand.

314
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:07,253
Can I text you?

315
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:28,571
It's perfect, Aldo.

316
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:33,602
Oh. I was hoping
we could celebrate.

317
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:35,739
No. So was I.

318
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:37,408
I've got a class at Juilliard.

319
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:38,574
Oh, good.

320
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:40,112
I promised Ben.

321
00:19:40,248 --> 00:19:43,685
I'm sure you'll have a few
elbowing for an Accordion slot.

322
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:47,260
We should open up
the fellowship.

323
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,593
- What, expand our numbers?
- No, our sex.

324
00:19:49,729 --> 00:19:52,931
I mean, it feels quaint
to keep things single-gender.

325
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,266
We've made our point.

326
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,025
And, honestly,
we've had no real trouble

327
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,000
successfully placing
any of them.

328
00:19:58,135 --> 00:19:59,936
Except one.

329
00:20:00,071 --> 00:20:01,707
Oh, well.

330
00:20:01,842 --> 00:20:03,841
She had issues.

331
00:20:03,977 --> 00:20:05,476
So I've heard.

332
00:20:05,612 --> 00:20:07,603
The topic comes up
in every Citibank meeting

333
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:10,014
with her father.

334
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:11,618
I'm sorry about that.

335
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:12,809
It's fine.

336
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:15,115
It's nothing I can't handle.

337
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:20,320
So, you want to torpedo
Accordion's founding principle?

338
00:20:20,456 --> 00:20:22,357
We'd likely lose donors.

339
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:24,955
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

340
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,031
M-Maybe it's something
we revisit

341
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,027
- down the line.
- Sure.

342
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:31,533
Now, Bryant Park's locked
for the 25th.

343
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:33,635
Nan asked me
to help fill the place,

344
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:35,467
so the Kaplan Fund
is gonna buy some radio

345
00:20:35,603 --> 00:20:37,633
and outdoor advertising.

346
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,812
And claqueurs.

347
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:41,136
It's too big, Eliot.

348
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:42,681
She should have booked
the Strand.

349
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:44,013
Relax.

350
00:20:44,148 --> 00:20:46,252
It'll be great.

351
00:20:46,388 --> 00:20:48,783
And it almost falls
on your birthday.

352
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,091
I was, uh, I was sorry
you weren't able to make it

353
00:20:53,227 --> 00:20:55,295
to my Mahler Three in London.

354
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:57,825
Me, too.

355
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:01,532
Uh, Petra had a school thing.

356
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:06,306
Uh, and I promised Sharon
I'd be there.

357
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:09,341
Of course.

358
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,576
I was just hoping
for your honest opinion.

359
00:21:12,711 --> 00:21:15,443
My player rating sheets
were off the charts.

360
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:17,416
Those are confidential, Eliot.

361
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:19,847
Well, the principal oboist
is a big fan.

362
00:21:21,086 --> 00:21:22,355
On the way back,

363
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,181
I was listening to yours
with the Israeli Phil,

364
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,182
and I was struck
by what you managed to pull

365
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,524
from the strings
in the last movement.

366
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,127
I mean, how did you
get them there?

367
00:21:32,262 --> 00:21:33,690
Was it the hall?

368
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,291
Was it the players?

369
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:38,369
The players weren't
very obliging.

370
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,104
The principal violinist
came up to me

371
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,372
after the first rehearsal

372
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,533
- and asked if I was a Jew.
- What?

373
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:46,479
It seemed to him unusual, if
not suspicious, that a non-Jew

374
00:21:46,614 --> 00:21:49,580
would be interested
in conducting Jewish music.

375
00:21:49,715 --> 00:21:52,583
Felt like Max Bruch.

376
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:56,046
Well, big Jew that I am,
the Kaplan Fund has, uh,

377
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,048
committed a sizable
amount to them

378
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,657
- for a klezmer commission.
- Mm-hmm.

379
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,657
Uh, maybe they'll invite me
to guest conduct.

380
00:22:01,793 --> 00:22:03,719
Oh, well, they'd be lucky
to have you.

381
00:22:03,854 --> 00:22:05,622
Oh, please.

382
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,597
I know my place.

383
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:10,370
Money can't always
buy you everything.

384
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:13,439
You don't really believe that.

385
00:22:13,575 --> 00:22:15,569
I'll have you know
I tried to bribe Francesca

386
00:22:15,704 --> 00:22:17,272
to let me look at your notation.

387
00:22:17,408 --> 00:22:18,844
She sent me packing.

388
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:20,470
Good girl.

389
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,106
That gentleman sitting
over there with the gnome

390
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:25,484
is urgently focused
on our table.

391
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:28,749
At first, I thought
he was looking at me,

392
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:31,023
but I think he's got
his eye on you.

393
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:32,920
Please try and ignore him.

394
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:35,159
I can excuse myself
and go wash my hands

395
00:22:35,295 --> 00:22:36,920
if you'd like to be alone.

396
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,796
And I would never forgive you.

397
00:22:39,932 --> 00:22:42,024
The last thing I need
is to be buttonholed in here

398
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,096
by someone exactly like me.

399
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:47,607
Uh, what time are you
leaving tomorrow?

400
00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:50,833
Francesca's looking
into flights.

401
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,175
Well, call her off.

402
00:22:52,311 --> 00:22:54,002
Leave when you like.

403
00:22:54,138 --> 00:22:55,778
You don't have to do that.

404
00:22:55,913 --> 00:22:59,618
My motives are not entirely
altruistic.

405
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,151
Just one peek. One peek
at your performing score.

406
00:23:05,024 --> 00:23:06,390
Fine.

407
00:23:06,525 --> 00:23:09,519
- Would 5:15 be okay?
- Sure.

408
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:12,494
Okay, I mean, I do... I have
to get turned around fast.

409
00:23:12,629 --> 00:23:14,828
We're filling a vacant position.

410
00:23:14,963 --> 00:23:17,002
Oh, please tell me
it's Sebastian.

411
00:23:17,138 --> 00:23:18,369
Now, be fair, Eliot.

412
00:23:18,504 --> 00:23:20,829
Sebastian has decent technique.

413
00:23:20,965 --> 00:23:22,231
He has baton.

414
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,741
A month ago,
I dropped into Bunkamura

415
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:26,974
to watch the Turing machine
trot out Chopin One.

416
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:30,510
Ol' Sebastian really
is Mr. Tempo Rubato.

417
00:23:30,646 --> 00:23:32,215
Robot-o is more like it.

418
00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:33,551
Why do you keep him on?

419
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:35,883
Oh, he's Andris's man,
you know that.

420
00:23:36,018 --> 00:23:37,657
Exactly. You inherited
that decision.

421
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,658
Seven years is a long time
to pretend you respect it.

422
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,121
They have different
labor contracts over there.

423
00:23:44,398 --> 00:23:47,361
He's a... he's a strange guy.

424
00:23:47,496 --> 00:23:48,857
Who? Andris?

425
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:50,861
No, Sebastian.

426
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,335
He has, uh, fetishes.

427
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:55,333
Fetishes? Like what?

428
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:59,035
Nostalgia for prewar Kalmus
miniature scores,

429
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,004
dead-stock pencils he's seen

430
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,039
von Karajan hold in photographs.

431
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,007
You know, that sort of thing.

432
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:07,487
That's just sad.

433
00:24:11,556 --> 00:24:14,021
Yeah, but you're not wrong.

434
00:24:14,156 --> 00:24:17,156
I am gonna have to rotate him
at some point.

435
00:24:19,428 --> 00:24:21,831
For who?

436
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,601
<i>What Love Teaches Me.</i>

437
00:24:27,736 --> 00:24:30,004
That string notation.

438
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:33,678
Mahler gives it to you himself.

439
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,382
- Come on.
- Trust me.

440
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,880
You do not want to go to school

441
00:24:39,016 --> 00:24:41,416
on someone else's
red and blue pencil.

442
00:24:41,552 --> 00:24:43,054
Least of all, mine.

443
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,547
Oh, but I do.

444
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:45,956
All right.
Will you quit pestering me?

445
00:24:46,092 --> 00:24:48,059
Yes.

446
00:24:48,194 --> 00:24:50,189
Free bowing.

447
00:24:51,622 --> 00:24:53,929
It's not pretty
for an audience to look at,

448
00:24:54,064 --> 00:24:55,562
but if you can manage
to keep your players

449
00:24:55,698 --> 00:24:57,570
out of the weeds...

450
00:24:58,405 --> 00:25:00,606
...the sound's ferocious.

451
00:25:02,207 --> 00:25:04,104
Oh.

452
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:10,583
There's no glory
for a robot, Eliot.

453
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,215
Do your own thing.

454
00:25:18,322 --> 00:25:20,593
Hmm.

455
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:40,970
All right, um...

456
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,615
Let's... stop here.

457
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,451
- Thank you, Max. Very good.
- Thanks.

458
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:50,388
Um, just for my own
edification...

459
00:25:50,524 --> 00:25:52,619
why did you come to Juilliard?

460
00:25:55,995 --> 00:25:58,194
Uh, it's the best music
conservatory in the country?

461
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:01,324
People from Curtis, Eastman,
and others may beg to differ.

462
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,801
I mean,
Juilliard's a brand, right?

463
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:06,637
So, did you come to study
with a brand?

464
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,906
- No.
- No, right. So there's a teacher

465
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:11,335
or graduate somewhere
down the line who, you know,

466
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:12,843
conjured something
in your imagination.

467
00:26:12,978 --> 00:26:15,213
- Someone you aspire to be yourself.
- Mm-hmm.

468
00:26:15,348 --> 00:26:16,972
So, who was that?

469
00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:18,482
Sarah Chang.

470
00:26:18,617 --> 00:26:20,385
Hmm. So you're a violinist?

471
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,154
- Yeah.
- All right, okay.

472
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,756
Well, I can see why

473
00:26:23,891 --> 00:26:26,484
you would choose to conduct
a piece like this.

474
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,893
Must be a familiar pleasure
in presiding over

475
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:31,727
a bed of strings that behave
as if they're tuning.

476
00:26:31,862 --> 00:26:33,695
Now...

477
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:38,329
this piece is very au courant.

478
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,838
I mean, here,
the composer tells us

479
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:43,007
to begin with "back-and-forth
tremolo strokes

480
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:47,043
with wire brush and slowly
sliding crotales over skin."

481
00:26:47,178 --> 00:26:49,609
Sounds like René Redzepi's
recipe for reindeer.

482
00:26:51,346 --> 00:26:54,010
It's exciting to play
new music, isn't it?

483
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,348
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

484
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:58,823
Great. All right, please,
join the other fellows.

485
00:27:00,157 --> 00:27:03,619
Now, I know you're all
conducting students

486
00:27:03,754 --> 00:27:06,398
of, uh, Mr. Wolfe's,
but how many of you

487
00:27:06,534 --> 00:27:09,597
are also studying composition?

488
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:11,202
Right, what's your name?

489
00:27:11,337 --> 00:27:12,633
Olive Kerr.

490
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:15,204
All right, Olive. Uh...

491
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,704
What do you make of what
we've just been listening to?

492
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,711
It's pretty awesome.

493
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:22,778
I mean, there's incredible
atonal tension.

494
00:27:22,913 --> 00:27:25,115
I agree about the tension part.

495
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:28,985
Now, you can intellectually
contemplate, or masturbate,

496
00:27:29,121 --> 00:27:32,914
about the felicity
of the so-called "atonal,"

497
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:38,593
but the important question here
is: What are you conducting?

498
00:27:38,729 --> 00:27:39,893
What is the effect?

499
00:27:40,028 --> 00:27:42,899
What is it actually doing to me?

500
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:46,767
Good music can be
as ornate as a cathedral

501
00:27:46,903 --> 00:27:49,007
or bare as a potting shed

502
00:27:49,143 --> 00:27:52,510
so long as it allows you to
answer both those questions.

503
00:27:52,645 --> 00:27:54,743
Max.

504
00:27:54,878 --> 00:27:57,211
Come on, what do you think?

505
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,922
When... Anna Thorvaldsdóttir
gave her master class,

506
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,951
she said she was often
influenced by the form

507
00:28:09,086 --> 00:28:14,459
and structure of landscapes
and nature she grew up within.

508
00:28:14,594 --> 00:28:16,834
But I'm not sure
she was interested per se

509
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,163
in, uh, describing
those actual sounds.

510
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,841
Very<i> Punkt Kontra Punkt.</i>

511
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:25,473
Yes.

512
00:28:25,608 --> 00:28:30,279
The intent of her composition
is vague, to say the least.

513
00:28:30,415 --> 00:28:35,181
So, if her intent is vague,
how do you, as a conductor,

514
00:28:35,317 --> 00:28:38,785
have a point of view
about anything?

515
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:40,354
Now, to be fair, I mean,

516
00:28:40,489 --> 00:28:42,885
there are times when you will
simply have no choice.

517
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,393
And you will be made to stand
in front of an orchestra

518
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:48,697
and pretend that there are
these invisible structures.

519
00:28:48,832 --> 00:28:51,793
But my prayer for you

520
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:54,004
is that you will be spared
the embarrassment

521
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:56,302
of standing on the podium
with a 4'33",

522
00:28:56,438 --> 00:28:58,970
trying to sell a car
without an engine.

523
00:28:59,106 --> 00:29:01,304
Because now, my friends,

524
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:04,509
now is the time to conduct music

525
00:29:04,644 --> 00:29:07,852
that actually requires
something of you.

526
00:29:07,987 --> 00:29:09,483
You know,
music that everybody knows

527
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:14,154
but will hear differently
when you interpret it for them.

528
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:18,021
For instance, Max,
why not a Kyrie?

529
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:23,225
You know, like, uh, something
like Bach's<i> Mass in B minor.</i>

530
00:29:24,902 --> 00:29:26,737
I'm not really into Bach.

531
00:29:26,872 --> 00:29:29,503
- You're not into Bach?
- Mm-hmm.

532
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:31,438
Oh, Max.

533
00:29:32,341 --> 00:29:34,442
Have you read
the Schweitzer book?

534
00:29:34,578 --> 00:29:36,205
No.

535
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,679
Well, you should.

536
00:29:37,815 --> 00:29:40,013
It's an important text.

537
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:42,417
Now, Antonia Brico thought so.

538
00:29:42,553 --> 00:29:45,354
So much so that she shipped
herself to Equatorial Africa

539
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,190
and canoed up the Congo River
to track Schweitzer down

540
00:29:48,325 --> 00:29:51,358
and ask him to teach her
what he knew about Bach.

541
00:29:51,494 --> 00:29:53,365
I mean, somewhere,
I've got a picture of her

542
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:55,598
in a, in a pith helmet.

543
00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:57,067
I mean, have you...

544
00:29:57,202 --> 00:30:01,104
have you ever played
or-or conducted Bach?

545
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:06,778
Honestly, as a BIPOC,
pangender person,

546
00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:08,714
I would say Bach's
misogynistic life

547
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:11,715
makes it kind of impossible
for me

548
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,249
to take his music seriously.

549
00:30:15,685 --> 00:30:17,286
Come on.

550
00:30:17,421 --> 00:30:20,253
What do... what do...
what do you mean by that?

551
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:24,429
Well, didn't he sire,
like, 20 kids?

552
00:30:24,565 --> 00:30:26,591
Yes, that's documented.

553
00:30:26,726 --> 00:30:30,164
Along with a considerable
amount of music.

554
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,764
But I'm sorry,
I'm... I'm unclear

555
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:35,407
as to what his prodigious
skills in the marital bed

556
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:38,573
have to do with B minor.

557
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:40,012
Sure.

558
00:30:40,147 --> 00:30:42,905
All right, whatever.
That's-that's your choice.

559
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,776
I mean, after all, "a soul
selects her own society."

560
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:48,612
But remember, the flip side
of that selection

561
00:30:48,748 --> 00:30:51,417
closes the valves
of one's attention.

562
00:30:51,553 --> 00:30:55,918
Now, of course,
siloing what is acceptable

563
00:30:56,053 --> 00:30:59,128
or not acceptable
is a basic construct of many,

564
00:30:59,264 --> 00:31:01,767
if not most,
symphony orchestras today,

565
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,667
who see it
as their imperial right

566
00:31:03,803 --> 00:31:05,427
to curate for the cretins.

567
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:07,270
So, slippery as it is,

568
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:11,109
there is some merit
in examining Max's allergy.

569
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:14,343
Can classical music
written by a bunch of straight,

570
00:31:14,478 --> 00:31:17,774
Austro-German, churchgoing
white guys exalt us,

571
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,150
individually
as-as well as collectively,

572
00:31:20,285 --> 00:31:24,286
and who, may I ask,
gets to decide that?

573
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:27,656
You know, what about Beethoven?

574
00:31:27,792 --> 00:31:29,619
You into him?

575
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:32,293
Because for me,
as a U-Haul lesbian,

576
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:35,660
I'm... I'm not too sure
about old Ludwig.

577
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:40,034
But then, I face him.

578
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:42,303
And I find myself nose-to-nose

579
00:31:42,438 --> 00:31:47,012
with his magnitude
and inevitability.

580
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:52,145
Come on, Max. Indulge me.

581
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,651
Let's allow Bach a similar gaze.

582
00:32:00,394 --> 00:32:01,961
Sit.

583
00:32:04,788 --> 00:32:07,495
Now, this is all
filigree, right?

584
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:12,334
I mean, it could be
a first-year piano student.

585
00:32:12,469 --> 00:32:17,141
♪ Or Schroeder playing
for Lucy. ♪

586
00:32:19,043 --> 00:32:21,475
Or Glenn Gould, for that matter.

587
00:32:26,053 --> 00:32:28,548
Now, it's not until
it changes...

588
00:32:29,746 --> 00:32:31,052
...when you get inside it,

589
00:32:31,187 --> 00:32:32,688
that you hear what it really is.

590
00:32:32,823 --> 00:32:34,521
It's a question.

591
00:32:36,927 --> 00:32:39,031
And an answer.

592
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:43,266
Which begs another question.

593
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,535
There's a humility in Bach.

594
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:51,472
He's not pretending
he's certain about anything.

595
00:32:51,607 --> 00:32:54,636
'Cause he knows
that it's always the question

596
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:57,716
that involves the listener.

597
00:32:57,852 --> 00:33:00,809
It's never the answer, right?

598
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:04,318
Now, the big question
for you is:

599
00:33:04,454 --> 00:33:07,026
What do you think, Max?

600
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,729
You play really well.

601
00:33:14,865 --> 00:33:21,005
But nowadays, white, male, cis
composers, just not my thing.

602
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:25,273
Don't be so eager
to be offended.

603
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:27,440
The narcissism
of small differences

604
00:33:27,576 --> 00:33:30,244
leads to the most boring
conformity.

605
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:32,278
I guess Edgard Varèse is okay.

606
00:33:32,413 --> 00:33:34,252
I mean, I like "Arcana," anyway.

607
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,283
Oh, well, then you must be
aware that Varèse

608
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:39,586
once famously stated that jazz

609
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:44,086
was "a Negro product
exploited by the Jews."

610
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:46,757
Didn't stop Jerry Goldsmith
from ripping him off

611
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:48,925
for his
<i>Planet of the Apes</i> score.

612
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,367
It's kind of a perfect insult,
don't you think?

613
00:33:51,503 --> 00:33:55,139
But you see, the problem
with enrolling yourself

614
00:33:55,274 --> 00:33:57,639
as an ultrasonic epistemic
dissident

615
00:33:57,775 --> 00:34:01,344
is that if Bach's talent
can be reduced to his gender,

616
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:04,616
birth country, religion,
sexuality, and so on,

617
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,219
then so can yours.

618
00:34:07,354 --> 00:34:10,618
Now, someday, Max,
when you go out into the world

619
00:34:10,754 --> 00:34:14,392
and you guest conduct
for a major or minor orchestra,

620
00:34:14,528 --> 00:34:17,553
you may notice that the players
have more than light bulbs

621
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:20,055
and music on their stands.

622
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,232
They will also have been
handed rating sheets,

623
00:34:23,368 --> 00:34:26,232
the purpose of which
is to rate you.

624
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:28,569
Now, what kind of criteria

625
00:34:28,704 --> 00:34:31,300
would you hope that they would
use to do this?

626
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:34,674
Your score reading and stick
technique, or something else?

627
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:41,017
All right, everyone,
using Max's criteria,

628
00:34:41,152 --> 00:34:43,814
let's consider Max's thing.

629
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:46,488
In this case,
Anna Thorvaldsdóttir.

630
00:34:46,623 --> 00:34:50,259
Now, can we agree on two pieces
of observation?

631
00:34:50,395 --> 00:34:52,989
One, that Anna was born
in Iceland.

632
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,333
And two, that she is,
in a, I don't know,

633
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,866
Waldorf teacher kinda way,
a super hot young woman.

634
00:34:58,002 --> 00:34:59,895
Show of hands.

635
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,071
All right,
now let's turn our gaze

636
00:35:02,206 --> 00:35:04,165
back to the piano bench up there

637
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:07,412
and see if we can square
how any of those things

638
00:35:07,548 --> 00:35:11,748
possibly relate to the person
we see seated before us.

639
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,421
Oh, where are you going?

640
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,518
You're a fucking bitch.

641
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,057
And you are a robot.

642
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:29,692
I mean, unfortunately,
the architect of your soul

643
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,361
appears to be social media.

644
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:35,698
You want to dance the mask,
you must service the composer.

645
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,042
You gotta sublimate yourself,

646
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,905
your ego, and, yes,
your identity.

647
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:42,714
You must, in fact, stand
in front of the public and God

648
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,514
and obliterate yourself.

649
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,387
All right.

650
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:51,047
During the lockdown,

651
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,252
you did something
I thought remarkable.

652
00:35:53,388 --> 00:35:55,052
You made music for free.

653
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:57,753
Anyone at all could stream
Berlin performances

654
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:00,130
without ever paying a dime.

655
00:36:00,266 --> 00:36:02,257
Well, that-that was a...

656
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:05,470
it's a democratically made
decision by the players.

657
00:36:05,605 --> 00:36:09,672
And though I-I wish I could
claim the idea was mine,

658
00:36:09,808 --> 00:36:13,275
it really did spring from
the heart of Sharon Good now.

659
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:14,846
Sharon is your partner.

660
00:36:14,982 --> 00:36:16,171
You have a child together,

661
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,744
and she's also the
concertmaster for Berlin.

662
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,919
- Does that ever...
- Yes, that's right.

663
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:22,520
...complicate things for you?

664
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,756
Your work getting into your
home or the other way ar...?

665
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:39,766
Jake said he was certain

666
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:41,773
you'd be happy with the drape
of the seat.

667
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:43,265
I will be...

668
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,605
...if I can keep the fat off
until next month.

669
00:36:45,741 --> 00:36:48,577
You never gain weight.

670
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:54,144
Your... your mother texted me.

671
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,679
She knows you're busy
but is hoping to drop by.

672
00:36:58,121 --> 00:36:59,619
Next trip.

673
00:36:59,755 --> 00:37:01,988
What are you thinking
for dinner?

674
00:37:02,124 --> 00:37:03,660
Uh, no.

675
00:37:03,796 --> 00:37:06,530
No, I'm-I'm gonna stay in
and put this piano to good use.

676
00:37:06,665 --> 00:37:10,292
I'm suspicious of the E natural
in the cello line.

677
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:13,628
Doesn't it sound like
warmed-over Charles Ives to you?

678
00:37:13,763 --> 00:37:15,371
Not-not at all.

679
00:37:15,506 --> 00:37:17,369
But don't worry,
I'll call Houston.

680
00:37:17,505 --> 00:37:18,805
They'll be flexible.

681
00:37:18,941 --> 00:37:21,472
You must have
some New Haven friends

682
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:23,642
you want to see tonight?

683
00:37:23,777 --> 00:37:25,916
No. Not really.

684
00:37:27,684 --> 00:37:30,813
Should I stop by later
for notes?

685
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,819
No, that won't be necessary.

686
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:35,789
Okay.

687
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:43,533
Oh, I, I-I almost forgot, but...

688
00:37:43,668 --> 00:37:46,527
this was left for you
at the front desk.

689
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:47,706
By who?

690
00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:49,698
They didn't say.

691
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,532
Wh-What, no card?

692
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:52,706
No.

693
00:37:52,842 --> 00:37:54,744
Okay, just, just leave it
over there.

694
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,945
Thanks.

695
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,022
Good night.

696
00:38:08,157 --> 00:38:09,691
Night.

697
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:19,195
You're listening to

698
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,571
<i>All Things Considered</i>
from NPR News.

699
00:38:21,707 --> 00:38:23,265
<i>All Things Considered</i>

00:38:32,751 --> 00:38:34,980

- And you should, too.

706
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:39,121
And now, more from NPR.

707
00:38:39,257 --> 00:38:40,491
Over the next few weeks,

708
00:38:40,626 --> 00:38:42,624
we'll be hearing poems
from four finalists

709
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,464
for the National
Youth Poet Laureate Award.

710
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:56,471
When were you informed of this?

711
00:38:56,607 --> 00:38:59,243
Just this morning.

712
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,473
Mr. Kaplan was very apologetic.

713
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:02,907
I was able to get us on

714
00:39:03,043 --> 00:39:04,575
the 7:00 a.m. you like,
through Munich.

715
00:39:04,711 --> 00:39:05,745
The connection's short,

716
00:39:05,881 --> 00:39:07,909
but special services
are standing by.

717
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,753
Where are things with DG?

718
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,357
Please tell me they've finally
woken up to see the wisdom

719
00:39:12,493 --> 00:39:14,754
of honest-to-God LPs
for this release?

720
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,825
No movement there yet.

721
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,592
Have you looked at the email
I drafted for you?

722
00:39:18,727 --> 00:39:19,992
- Sent it last night.
- Mm-hmm.

723
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:22,864
- Well, just forward me their response.
- Mm-hmm.

724
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,933
What's your take
on<i> The New Yorker</i> talk?

725
00:39:28,306 --> 00:39:29,501
It went well, I thought.

726
00:39:29,637 --> 00:39:31,274
Oh. You're hedging.

727
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,045
I was garrulous.

728
00:39:34,181 --> 00:39:35,379
No.

729
00:39:35,515 --> 00:39:37,444
No, not at all.
You, you were fabulous.

730
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,847
Francesca.

731
00:39:39,982 --> 00:39:42,520
If you have any real interest
in conducting,

732
00:39:42,655 --> 00:39:44,450
you need to be able
to speak your mind.

733
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:46,558
Okay. Perhaps you...

734
00:39:46,693 --> 00:39:48,993
You could've made less
of the relationship with...

735
00:39:49,128 --> 00:39:50,526
- Lenny?
- No.

736
00:39:50,662 --> 00:39:52,893
I-I was thinking
about Mahler and Alma's.

737
00:39:53,029 --> 00:39:54,796
- Oh. Huh.
- You implied that she betrayed him.

738
00:39:54,931 --> 00:39:58,067
I'm not, I'm not sure
I agree with that.

739
00:39:58,202 --> 00:39:59,499
Oh, really?

740
00:39:59,635 --> 00:40:01,196
Alma was a composer, too,

741
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,374
but he insisted
she stop writing music.

742
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,039
He said there was
only room for...

743
00:40:05,175 --> 00:40:07,310
- One asshole in the house?
- One asshole in the house. Yes.

744
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,138
And she agreed to those rules.

745
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:11,377
No one made that decision
for her.

746
00:40:11,512 --> 00:40:14,552
#Rules Of The Game.

747
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:20,459
Okay.

748
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,891
How was your evening?

749
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,369
Yeah, was uneventful.

750
00:40:31,505 --> 00:40:33,735
Are there any
of Sharon's pills left?

751
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,875
No, but Dr. Korovin
called these in.

752
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,511
Ah, thanks.

753
00:40:46,818 --> 00:40:49,617
I received another weird email
from Krista.

754
00:40:49,752 --> 00:40:53,253
- Mm-hmm.
- How should I reply?

755
00:40:53,388 --> 00:40:55,054
Don't.

756
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,954
Well, this one felt
especially desperate.

757
00:43:00,448 --> 00:43:02,852
Do you have some kind
of profit-sharing deal

758
00:43:02,987 --> 00:43:05,419
with the utility company
that I am unaware of?

759
00:43:07,525 --> 00:43:09,985
The flutter's back.

760
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:13,356
It's... It's racing.

761
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:15,661
I can't find my Metoprolol
anywhere.

762
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:21,805
Oh, fuck.

763
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:37,315
Uh, I found this
lying loose in the drawer.

764
00:43:39,722 --> 00:43:42,056
Is this the right one?

765
00:43:43,492 --> 00:43:45,059
Yeah.

766
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,000
Thank you.

767
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:57,199
Is that a new bag?

768
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:59,576
Oh, it's just a gift from Eliot.

769
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:00,978
You want it?

770
00:44:01,114 --> 00:44:02,681
No.

771
00:44:03,744 --> 00:44:05,206
Suits you.

772
00:44:07,084 --> 00:44:12,790
Let's slow this down
to 60 beats a minute.

773
00:44:36,779 --> 00:44:38,580
Actually, it's 64 beats.

774
00:44:43,121 --> 00:44:46,257
Tried calling you
on your mobile last night.

775
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:47,918
Hmm.

776
00:44:48,054 --> 00:44:50,822
And again at the hotel.

777
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:53,391
Must've been asleep.

778
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:56,257
You never sleep that deeply.

779
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,494
No, no, don't be a scold.

780
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:02,303
♪ Feelin' a feelin' ♪

781
00:45:03,406 --> 00:45:09,913
♪ For somethin' there ain't
too much of... ♪

782
00:45:10,681 --> 00:45:12,784
I'm worried about Petra.

783
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,317
She's starting to disappear
into herself.

784
00:45:19,523 --> 00:45:21,320
Be specific.

785
00:45:24,294 --> 00:45:27,856
She keeps coming home
with bruises on her shins.

786
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:32,133
And then when I ask her
about it, she gets quiet.

787
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,465
I mean, I hope
it's just playground football

788
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,300
and not some<i> Biodeutsche</i> thing.

789
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:42,176
Hmm, we talked about this.

790
00:45:43,444 --> 00:45:46,516
But maybe we just need
to put more effort

791
00:45:46,652 --> 00:45:49,486
into finding her a friend.

792
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:51,318
Last year was really hard

793
00:45:51,454 --> 00:45:54,991
to be locked up alone
with two old ladies like us.

794
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:01,360
She's old enough to learn piano.

795
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:05,133
I'll teach her.

796
00:46:09,803 --> 00:46:11,870
Yeah.

797
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:14,472
That might be good.

798
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:17,915
How's your heart?

799
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:21,083
Better now.

800
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,034
Knock, knock. Who's there?

801
00:46:46,169 --> 00:46:48,541
Lenny?

802
00:46:48,677 --> 00:46:50,876
Walter?

803
00:46:51,011 --> 00:46:53,985
Oh, it's you, MTT.

804
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,049
Why do you insist on holding
things up like that?

805
00:46:57,184 --> 00:46:58,813
Your business here is rejoicing,

806
00:46:58,948 --> 00:47:02,423
not screaming
like a fucking porn star.

807
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:04,560
Michael Tilson Thomas...

808
00:47:13,396 --> 00:47:15,368
Hello, Petra.

809
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:20,373
Why are you lurking? Hmm?

810
00:47:21,207 --> 00:47:23,508
Tell me and I'll help.

811
00:47:24,244 --> 00:47:25,749
- Sharon?
- Hmm?

812
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,110
Uh, I'm taking Petra to school.

813
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:29,577
Oh, okay.

814
00:47:29,712 --> 00:47:32,253
- Come on.
<i>- Tschüss.</i>

815
00:47:52,142 --> 00:47:54,940
Who'll bear the pall?

816
00:47:55,076 --> 00:47:56,805
"We," said the wren,

817
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,813
- "both the cock and the hen."
- The hen.

818
00:47:59,949 --> 00:48:01,719
"I'll..."

819
00:48:01,855 --> 00:48:04,048
"We'll bear the pall."

820
00:48:04,184 --> 00:48:05,880
And who'll sing a psalm?

821
00:48:06,015 --> 00:48:10,461
"I," said the thrush
as she sat on a bush.

822
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:12,496
"I'll sing a song."

823
00:48:12,632 --> 00:48:14,564
"Who'll toll the bell?"

824
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,961
"I," said the bull,

825
00:48:16,097 --> 00:48:18,568
"because I can pull.

826
00:48:18,704 --> 00:48:20,001
I'll toll the bell."

827
00:48:20,136 --> 00:48:22,838
All the birds of the air

828
00:48:22,973 --> 00:48:25,907
fell a-sighing and a-sobbing

829
00:48:26,043 --> 00:48:28,908
when they heard the bell toll

830
00:48:29,044 --> 00:48:33,116
for poor Cock Robin!

831
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:42,059
It's gonna be okay.

832
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,597
All right.
Okay, which one is she?

833
00:48:48,732 --> 00:48:50,969
The red one.

834
00:48:53,738 --> 00:48:55,666
- Bye.
- Go on.

835
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,547
<i>Hallo,</i> Johanna.

836
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:05,208
Hello. Hi.

837
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,746
They're all in the chamber hall?

838
00:50:13,882 --> 00:50:15,616
Yes.

839
00:50:15,752 --> 00:50:18,056
No.

840
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:00,296
Good morning.

841
00:51:01,328 --> 00:51:03,801
Oh, I'm sorry, Maestro.

842
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:05,534
We weren't sure you were coming.

843
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:08,998
We were told there might be,
um, a scheduling conflict.

844
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:10,972
Would you like me to take notes?

845
00:51:11,108 --> 00:51:12,242
No, thank you, Sebastian.

846
00:51:12,378 --> 00:51:13,736
That won't be necessary.

847
00:51:13,872 --> 00:51:15,375
Do we all have
our rating sheets?

848
00:51:15,511 --> 00:51:17,248
- We narrowed it down to three.
- Mm-hmm.

849
00:51:17,383 --> 00:51:19,640
So, unless anyone has
other business to discuss,

850
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:21,680
let's bring in number one.

851
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,429
Goossens stands, sounds his A.

852
00:52:41,565 --> 00:52:44,335
And of course, uh, Léon
was rather famous

853
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:48,637
- for his, um, rather wide vibrato, huh?
- Hmm.

854
00:52:48,773 --> 00:52:52,236
Beech am looks up and says,
"Gentlemen, take your pick."

855
00:52:55,145 --> 00:52:57,072
How's the writing going?

856
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:00,308
Ah, I never know how
to answer that question.

857
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:01,448
No.

858
00:53:01,584 --> 00:53:04,120
Makes it sound like
a physical act.

859
00:53:04,255 --> 00:53:06,085
Like, how's the shitting going?

860
00:53:07,924 --> 00:53:09,090
Okay.

861
00:53:09,226 --> 00:53:11,091
How's the thinking going?

862
00:53:11,226 --> 00:53:13,462
Yeah, not so well.

863
00:53:13,597 --> 00:53:16,100
I keep hearing something
and getting excited

864
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:19,668
only to catch myself
in pastiche.

865
00:53:19,804 --> 00:53:21,168
Hmm.

866
00:53:21,303 --> 00:53:23,437
Uh, it's all pastiche.

867
00:53:23,573 --> 00:53:25,943
We all have the same
musical grammar.

868
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:28,777
Uh, just look at Beethoven Five.

869
00:53:28,913 --> 00:53:31,977
The third movement's theme has
the same sequence of intervals

870
00:53:32,113 --> 00:53:35,681
as the opening theme of the
final movement of Mozart Forty.

871
00:53:35,816 --> 00:53:38,152
Mm, th-that could've been
a coincidence.

872
00:53:38,287 --> 00:53:40,157
No. Not in this case.

873
00:53:40,293 --> 00:53:42,984
If you examine
the sketchbooks he used,

874
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,061
29 bars of Mozart's
finale appear.

875
00:53:47,197 --> 00:53:49,399
Copied out by Beethoven.

876
00:53:49,534 --> 00:53:53,632
Oh, my God. I find that
extremely depressing.

877
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:55,466
I finished reading
your manuscript.

878
00:53:55,601 --> 00:53:57,203
It's very good, Lydia.

879
00:53:57,338 --> 00:53:59,308
One for the ages.

880
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,575
And, I dare say,
will be available

881
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:03,243
long after my book
has been forgotten.

882
00:54:03,378 --> 00:54:04,878
Oh, yes, you're right.

883
00:54:05,013 --> 00:54:08,347
The entire first printing
will always be available.

884
00:54:08,482 --> 00:54:10,717
Too modest, as usual.

885
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,464
Thank you, Andris.

886
00:54:22,363 --> 00:54:24,163
I'll cherish this.

887
00:54:24,298 --> 00:54:26,365
You may use it.

888
00:54:26,501 --> 00:54:28,834
A-a blurb for the covers.

889
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,537
Oh, thank you.

890
00:54:32,673 --> 00:54:34,539
I'll send it to the publisher.

891
00:54:34,675 --> 00:54:36,542
Hopefully, there's still time.

892
00:54:36,677 --> 00:54:39,016
I'm proud to call you my pupil,

893
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,346
uh, even though there was really

894
00:54:40,482 --> 00:54:41,710
nothing I could teach you.

895
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,147
Now, that's not true.

896
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:46,047
I'd never have the position
here were it not for you.

897
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:48,419
Then you'd be in London,
New York.

898
00:54:48,555 --> 00:54:50,526
They're not Berlin.

899
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:54,030
Besides, I'm not sure
what Sharon would do,

900
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,297
were we ever to leave.

901
00:54:55,432 --> 00:54:57,133
She's so close with her family.

902
00:54:57,269 --> 00:55:00,702
Ah, yeah, the Good now sisters.

903
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:03,403
I remember the elder one
being an absolute ball-breaker

904
00:55:03,538 --> 00:55:06,476
while she still held sway at DG.

905
00:55:06,611 --> 00:55:10,638
- Heike is a woman of many opinions.
- Oh.

906
00:55:10,773 --> 00:55:11,710
And that voice.

907
00:55:11,845 --> 00:55:13,140
I mean, the signal-to-noise
ratio,

908
00:55:13,275 --> 00:55:15,386
it's unbearable.

909
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:17,547
I've had to bolt-hole
at my old place in town

910
00:55:17,683 --> 00:55:20,215
to get any writing done.

911
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,588
Schopenhauer measured
a man's intelligence

912
00:55:21,723 --> 00:55:23,893
against his sensitivity
to noise.

913
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:28,393
Didn't he once also throw
a woman down a flight of stairs

914
00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:30,000
who later sued him?

915
00:55:30,136 --> 00:55:31,232
Yes.

916
00:55:31,367 --> 00:55:32,764
Although, it's unclear

917
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:34,402
this private
and personal failing

918
00:55:34,537 --> 00:55:37,170
is at all relevant to his work.

919
00:55:44,873 --> 00:55:46,807
You're late.

920
00:55:48,385 --> 00:55:49,417
Here, give me your stick.

921
00:55:49,552 --> 00:55:51,185
- Thank you.
- I've got it.

922
00:59:37,644 --> 00:59:39,947
Okay. Uh...

923
00:59:41,451 --> 00:59:42,581
<i>Gut, gut.</i>

924
00:59:45,781 --> 00:59:47,988
...Christian...

925
00:59:52,064 --> 00:59:53,427
Okay?

926
00:59:53,563 --> 00:59:55,562
Uh, but it's also...

927
00:59:55,698 --> 00:59:56,764
It's like we're hearing it

928
00:59:56,899 --> 00:59:59,400
from a very, very great
distance.

929
00:59:59,536 --> 01:00:04,998
So it's...

930
01:00:05,133 --> 01:00:06,233
Ju... Uh...

931
01:00:06,368 --> 01:00:07,739
Sorry.<i> Ist</i> Harald da?

932
01:00:10,674 --> 01:00:12,681
Harald? I was just wondering
if you might, um,

933
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:15,378
uh, quickly rig something up
for us?

934
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:48,375
<i>Gut, gut, gut.</i>

935
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,653
Harald?

936
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:52,387
Uh, we'll want the same
backstage setup

937
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:53,589
for the live recording.

938
01:00:53,724 --> 01:00:55,725
One, two, one.

939
01:01:23,284 --> 01:01:26,256
Okay? Looks great, but...

940
01:01:26,392 --> 01:01:27,514
...we need to hear it.

941
01:01:27,649 --> 01:01:30,293
Okay? It's not...

942
01:01:31,955 --> 01:01:32,859
Hey.

943
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:41,600
<i>Ja?</i>

944
01:01:41,735 --> 01:01:44,071
Okay?

945
01:01:57,423 --> 01:01:59,288
No.

946
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,923
Bah!

947
01:02:01,691 --> 01:02:03,255
It's-it's much too slow.

948
01:02:11,797 --> 01:02:13,334
Mm-hmm.

949
01:02:13,469 --> 01:02:15,535
Okay.

950
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,239
Okay, tutti.

951
01:02:17,374 --> 01:02:18,803
Uh...

952
01:02:20,877 --> 01:02:23,136
How are things feeling up here?

953
01:02:23,271 --> 01:02:24,371
Fine, yeah.

954
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:25,982
Yeah, actually great, but, uh,

955
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,313
it's a shame we don't record
this one direct-to-disk.

956
01:02:28,448 --> 01:02:31,349
Oh. It's criminal,
is more like it.

957
01:02:32,547 --> 01:02:33,989
Will you shoot me the MP3s?

958
01:02:34,124 --> 01:02:36,026
Yeah, sure,
but don't you want WAV files?

959
01:02:36,162 --> 01:02:39,495
No, just think what people
will actually be streaming.

960
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,829
Uh, what about video?

961
01:02:40,964 --> 01:02:42,731
Yes, yes.
Uh, stage left A camera.

962
01:02:42,867 --> 01:02:44,195
- Okay.
- All right. Thanks, guys.

963
01:02:44,331 --> 01:02:46,094
Okay. Uh, bye.
You're quite welcome.

964
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:49,830
- There?
- Yeah.

965
01:02:49,965 --> 01:02:51,666
You want us to come,
to come in stronger there?

966
01:02:51,802 --> 01:02:53,008
- Okay, then yeah.
- Yeah.

967
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,670
Here, 'cause the reigning
dynamic is forte,

968
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:56,074
which is not good.

969
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:57,839
- Hmm.
- Yeah?

970
01:02:57,975 --> 01:03:00,911
Yeah. Um, just
one small thing, Maestro.

971
01:03:01,047 --> 01:03:03,844
During the scherzo, um,

972
01:03:03,979 --> 01:03:06,956
th-th-the clarinet solo's
still a bit too loud.

973
01:03:07,091 --> 01:03:09,023
It should really be
an accompanying figure

974
01:03:09,159 --> 01:03:12,095
- to the first violins.
- Hmm.

975
01:03:12,231 --> 01:03:15,597
But apart from that, I'd say
we're in very good shape.

976
01:03:15,732 --> 01:03:17,467
Thank you, Sebastian.

977
01:03:17,603 --> 01:03:19,837
Thank you.

978
01:03:24,873 --> 01:03:26,442
Accurate assessment?

979
01:03:26,577 --> 01:03:28,277
I don't think so.

980
01:03:28,413 --> 01:03:31,705
The clarinet is marked piano,
and we are marked pianissimo.

981
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,610
Sebastian likes to sit
in the stalls,

982
01:03:33,745 --> 01:03:37,310
but there's no problem
with the balance in the circle.

983
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:39,252
Mm-hmm.

984
01:03:40,424 --> 01:03:41,789
Mm-hmm.

985
01:03:41,925 --> 01:03:44,050
Something a bit more playful.

986
01:03:44,186 --> 01:03:45,522
Mm-hmm.

987
01:03:49,433 --> 01:03:51,667
Oh, and here's something
Tanya and I did with Gustavo.

988
01:03:51,802 --> 01:03:53,266
I think it's very powerful.

989
01:03:53,401 --> 01:03:55,730
Yes, it's-it's really wonderful
work, uh, Karl.

990
01:03:55,866 --> 01:03:57,574
I'm just wondering
if we might try something

991
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:00,570
a little less, uh, considered.

992
01:04:03,209 --> 01:04:05,577
Something simple like this?

993
01:04:05,713 --> 01:04:06,906
Hmm?

994
01:04:07,042 --> 01:04:09,412
I'm not sure how you would
want to light it.

995
01:04:09,548 --> 01:04:12,384
Have Harald dim
the houselights to half.

996
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,992
Houselights down half, please.

997
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:21,326
I mean, we could make it work,

998
01:04:21,462 --> 01:04:23,256
but we'd have to bring in
some lights.

999
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:25,232
Mm-hmm.

1000
01:04:28,172 --> 01:04:29,872
If we want to do
something like this,

1001
01:04:30,007 --> 01:04:32,008
uh, we'll have to bring
the hot lights

1002
01:04:32,144 --> 01:04:34,107
next week, Tanya...
Forget about the strobes.

1003
01:04:34,243 --> 01:04:36,442
Hmm.

1004
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:38,679
Thank you for waiting.

1005
01:04:38,815 --> 01:04:40,279
Of course, Maestro.

1006
01:04:40,415 --> 01:04:43,349
How are we feeling
about today's rehearsal?

1007
01:04:43,484 --> 01:04:47,281
Well, Sebastian thinks
your solo in the scherzo

1008
01:04:47,417 --> 01:04:49,392
is, uh, a bit loud.

1009
01:04:49,528 --> 01:04:50,625
It's possible.

1010
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:52,493
Hmm. I don't agree.

1011
01:04:52,629 --> 01:04:55,795
Your dynamic marking is higher
than that of the first violin.

1012
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:57,358
Yes, that's true.

1013
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:58,998
Look.

1014
01:04:59,134 --> 01:05:02,737
Sebastian's getting old, Knut.

1015
01:05:02,872 --> 01:05:04,502
I'm rotating him out.

1016
01:05:05,502 --> 01:05:07,538
You're the first to know.

1017
01:05:10,613 --> 01:05:12,983
Well...

1018
01:05:14,616 --> 01:05:17,850
Then I will organize a caucus,
and we'll take a vote.

1019
01:05:17,985 --> 01:05:20,854
No. No, you won't.

1020
01:05:20,989 --> 01:05:23,322
A vote must be taken.

1021
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:25,491
I am familiar with
the electoral conclave.

1022
01:05:25,626 --> 01:05:27,761
But the appointment
of the assistant conductor

1023
01:05:27,897 --> 01:05:30,490
is entirely my decision.

1024
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:33,366
Yes.

1025
01:05:33,502 --> 01:05:36,572
So, I can count on your
support with the others?

1026
01:05:38,641 --> 01:05:39,771
Yes.

1027
01:05:39,906 --> 01:05:41,172
Good.

1028
01:05:41,308 --> 01:05:42,536
Who will you replace him with?

1029
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:44,378
Oh. I'm considering a few names,

1030
01:05:44,514 --> 01:05:47,684
but the main thing is we
proceed with this immediately.

1031
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:50,010
I understand.

1032
01:05:50,145 --> 01:05:52,219
Maestro, uh, the other players
would like to know

1033
01:05:52,355 --> 01:05:53,851
if you have chosen
the companion piece.

1034
01:05:53,987 --> 01:05:55,993

01:07:41,031 --> 01:07:43,595
This isn't the place, Francesca.

1052
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:47,328
You're...
That's not about...

1053
01:07:48,706 --> 01:07:50,504
I just...

1054
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:54,111
I just got this from someone
over at Accordion.

1055
01:08:05,953 --> 01:08:07,318
Oh, no.

1056
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:11,695
When did this happen?

1057
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:13,790
Day before yesterday.

1058
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,833
That email she sent you,
it felt like she was already...

1059
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:21,832
Delete it. And the rest.

1060
01:08:21,967 --> 01:08:25,241
There's no reason to get
caught up in any intrigue.

1061
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:32,215
Now, now.

1062
01:08:33,617 --> 01:08:38,546
Come on. There's nothing
we could have done to stop her.

1063
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:41,020
She wasn't one of us.

1064
01:08:56,508 --> 01:09:00,039
I can't stop thinking about
our trip up the Ucayali.

1065
01:09:00,175 --> 01:09:01,473
Hmm.

1066
01:09:01,609 --> 01:09:03,544
- The three of us were so close.
- Yes.

1067
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:07,184
But that was before
she started making demands.

1068
01:09:08,849 --> 01:09:13,756
There was just something
not quite right about her.

1069
01:09:13,892 --> 01:09:16,492
She had so much promise.

1070
01:09:16,628 --> 01:09:18,285
She did.

1071
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:20,093
Yes.

1072
01:09:20,228 --> 01:09:22,562
Almost as much as you.

1073
01:09:26,535 --> 01:09:29,800
Now, we have to forget
about her.

1074
01:09:33,371 --> 01:09:35,377
You understand?

1075
01:09:40,249 --> 01:09:42,384
Right?

1076
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,152
- I'm sorry.
- No.

1077
01:09:46,287 --> 01:09:47,747
I know you're working.

1078
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:49,154
Oh.

1079
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:50,588
Your...

1080
01:09:50,723 --> 01:09:53,659
Your keys are on
the kitchen table.

1081
01:10:57,956 --> 01:10:59,828
She went straight to sleep.

1082
01:11:02,499 --> 01:11:04,895
Didn't even have
to hold her foot.

1083
01:11:09,573 --> 01:11:12,841
And she came home
in a much better mood.

1084
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,711
Oh, attagirl.

1085
01:11:24,353 --> 01:11:26,218
Met the new cellist today.

1086
01:11:26,354 --> 01:11:28,923
Oh, what was that like?

1087
01:11:29,059 --> 01:11:31,220
Olga Metkina.

1088
01:11:31,356 --> 01:11:33,026
Russian.

1089
01:11:33,162 --> 01:11:35,060
Strong player.

1090
01:11:35,195 --> 01:11:37,365
Good.

1091
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:40,530
Her facial posture
is a bit much.

1092
01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:42,035
How so?

1093
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:43,604
Her legato.

1094
01:11:43,739 --> 01:11:46,072
Looks like she's on
the verge of climaxing.

1095
01:11:50,509 --> 01:11:52,773
She is young.

1096
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:54,681
Ah, so you've met her.

1097
01:11:56,678 --> 01:11:58,210
No, no.

1098
01:11:58,346 --> 01:12:00,587
Uh, Francesca
mentioned something.

1099
01:12:00,722 --> 01:12:03,558
I think she's arranging
a welcome lunch.

1100
01:12:05,791 --> 01:12:08,460
You may want to hold off
on that.

1101
01:12:08,596 --> 01:12:11,533
Her invitation is conditional.

1102
01:12:14,435 --> 01:12:17,002
You have reservations?

1103
01:12:17,138 --> 01:12:18,973
No.

1104
01:12:19,108 --> 01:12:21,440
Not really.

1105
01:12:21,576 --> 01:12:24,381
We need to see if she fits in.

1106
01:12:28,086 --> 01:12:30,387
Did you take your pill?

1107
01:12:31,218 --> 01:12:33,584
No.

1108
01:12:33,719 --> 01:12:36,723
Thank you for reminding me.

1109
01:14:04,073 --> 01:14:06,246
How was Johanna yesterday?

1110
01:14:06,382 --> 01:14:09,009
She stays away now.

1111
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:11,213
You let me know if that changes.

1112
01:14:14,486 --> 01:14:18,187
Petra, last night, you weren't,
by any chance, in my study?

1113
01:14:19,322 --> 01:14:20,861
- No, Lydia.
- Because you do know

1114
01:14:20,996 --> 01:14:23,194
you're not supposed to be
in there without me.

1115
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:24,864
I know.

1116
01:14:26,701 --> 01:14:28,670
That's right.

1117
01:15:01,973 --> 01:15:03,706
S...

1118
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:05,738
It's not so simple.

1119
01:15:05,874 --> 01:15:07,340
It's got...
it's got to be messier.

1120
01:15:11,939 --> 01:15:13,172
Okay?

1121
01:15:21,754 --> 01:15:24,258
A lot of pressure. Okay?

1122
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:28,529
Okay?

1123
01:15:28,664 --> 01:15:30,262
S-So familiar to everyone here.

1124
01:15:30,398 --> 01:15:33,570
It really doesn't help you to
know this piece so well. Okay.

1125
01:15:34,633 --> 01:15:36,606
Same place.

1126
01:16:05,498 --> 01:16:06,898
Please.

1127
01:16:07,034 --> 01:16:09,302
Please, please, please.

1128
01:16:09,437 --> 01:16:11,641
You must watch.

1129
01:16:15,937 --> 01:16:17,410
Okay?

1130
01:16:17,546 --> 01:16:18,745
It's got to be like, uh,

1131
01:16:18,881 --> 01:16:22,311
just one person
singing their heart out.

1132
01:16:24,616 --> 01:16:26,914
And...

1133
01:16:32,624 --> 01:16:34,154
Okay.

1134
01:16:42,636 --> 01:16:44,168
Okay.

1135
01:16:46,842 --> 01:16:49,045
Maestro.

1136
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,240
What a surprise.

1137
01:16:50,375 --> 01:16:52,172
- I was just having a spot of lunch.
- Hmm.

1138
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:53,516
C-Can I offer you anything?

1139
01:16:53,652 --> 01:16:55,181
Uh, no, thank you.

1140
01:16:55,317 --> 01:16:58,019
- Mm, well, some tea, perhaps?
- No, thank you, Sebastian.

1141
01:16:59,022 --> 01:17:01,718
You know, I forget sometimes
just how impressive

1142
01:17:01,854 --> 01:17:03,555
your collection is here.

1143
01:17:03,691 --> 01:17:05,756
Is that Kalinnikov?

1144
01:17:05,892 --> 01:17:07,361
- Yes.
- Ah.

1145
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:09,465
Isn't he marvelous?

1146
01:17:09,601 --> 01:17:12,634
He belongs in a museum.

1147
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:15,099
I rescued him
for a hundred rubles

1148
01:17:15,235 --> 01:17:17,638
- from a Kyiv street fair back in '90.
- Huh.

1149
01:17:17,773 --> 01:17:19,632
Right after the Wall came down.

1150
01:17:19,767 --> 01:17:21,942
That must really
have been something.

1151
01:17:22,077 --> 01:17:25,076
- Oh, incredible to have lived through it.
- Hmm.

1152
01:17:25,212 --> 01:17:27,640
I'd only just arrived here
with Andris,

1153
01:17:27,775 --> 01:17:31,086
and suddenly the impossible
was possible.

1154
01:17:31,221 --> 01:17:32,788
Yeah.

1155
01:17:34,019 --> 01:17:36,482
I'd like to talk about that.

1156
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:38,393
- The reunification?
- Uh, no, no.

1157
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:40,495
But please, sit down.

1158
01:17:40,631 --> 01:17:43,732
No, uh, about the possibility

1159
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:47,394
of you fronting
a subscription orchestra.

1160
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:48,668
But I already do.

1161
01:17:48,804 --> 01:17:51,433
Yes, but not as Kapellmeister.

1162
01:17:52,777 --> 01:17:56,108
If not now,
then when, Sebastian?

1163
01:17:57,481 --> 01:17:58,942
You mean leave Berlin?

1164
01:17:59,077 --> 01:18:02,251
Well, rotate somewhere, yes.

1165
01:18:02,387 --> 01:18:04,486
But this is my home.

1166
01:18:04,621 --> 01:18:07,687
Our only home is the podium.

1167
01:18:07,823 --> 01:18:10,250
We all live out of a suitcase.

1168
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,388
You know that as well as anyone.

1169
01:18:18,568 --> 01:18:21,270
Just think about it.

1170
01:18:21,406 --> 01:18:23,696
Take your time. Mm?

1171
01:18:23,831 --> 01:18:26,908
It's not something
we need to decide now.

1172
01:18:29,645 --> 01:18:31,270
It's the girl, isn't it?

1173
01:18:31,405 --> 01:18:32,809
I'm sorry, what girl?

1174
01:18:32,945 --> 01:18:35,349
Y-You're not asking.

1175
01:18:35,484 --> 01:18:37,185
You're telling.

1176
01:18:37,321 --> 01:18:41,824
I knew as soon as she showed up
that my days here were numbered.

1177
01:18:41,959 --> 01:18:44,523
Andris told me not to worry,
but...

1178
01:18:44,658 --> 01:18:46,159
...I knew.

1179
01:18:46,294 --> 01:18:49,990
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

1180
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:51,161
Oh, please.

1181
01:18:51,297 --> 01:18:53,402
Just because
nobody dares breathe it.

1182
01:18:53,538 --> 01:18:55,537
We know the things you do.

1183
01:18:55,672 --> 01:18:58,503
The little favors you grant.

1184
01:18:58,638 --> 01:18:59,974
I'm...

1185
01:19:00,109 --> 01:19:03,335
I really don't know
what to say, Sebastian.

1186
01:19:03,471 --> 01:19:05,705
I mean, you of all people

1187
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:07,881
have the temerity
to question my integrity?

1188
01:19:08,016 --> 01:19:09,477
No, no.
I-I'm-I'm sorry, Maestro.

1189
01:19:09,613 --> 01:19:11,152
I don't, I don't know
what I'm saying.

1190
01:19:11,288 --> 01:19:13,846
No, no, no, it's clear you know
exactly what you're saying.

1191
01:19:13,981 --> 01:19:15,988
I mean, if that's how
you really feel about me,

1192
01:19:16,124 --> 01:19:17,856
then wouldn't you say
that staying is

1193
01:19:17,992 --> 01:19:19,157
entirely out of the question?

1194
01:19:19,293 --> 01:19:21,253
No, no, please, Maestro.
Please forgive me.

1195
01:19:21,388 --> 01:19:22,822
For what?

1196
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:26,196
Your obsequiousness,
your hypocrisy, your misogamy?

1197
01:19:26,332 --> 01:19:29,438
- I'm not a misogynist!
- Misogamy.

1198
01:19:29,574 --> 01:19:31,973
It's a hatred of marriage.

1199
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:36,507
Andris is still
very much married.

1200
01:19:37,677 --> 01:19:42,510
And you occupy an apartment
on the same floor, don't you?

1201
01:19:42,646 --> 01:19:46,045
I just don't like
what he's implying.

1202
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:50,015
It could lead to more than
Chinese whispers.

1203
01:19:50,151 --> 01:19:51,627
I know.

1204
01:19:51,762 --> 01:19:53,124
We barely survived<i> Der Spiegel</i>

1205
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:55,524
when you and I
came out together.

1206
01:19:57,101 --> 01:20:01,365
But with Francesca, no one
could point their finger.

1207
01:20:01,501 --> 01:20:03,867
It's not like you two are
in a relationship.

1208
01:20:04,002 --> 01:20:05,467
Yeah, that's true.

1209
01:20:05,602 --> 01:20:07,800
I just...
Turns my stomach to think

1210
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,539
the old robot will be right
about something.

1211
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:16,083
He's probably already run
to Andris.

1212
01:20:16,218 --> 01:20:19,654
Well, is there someone
other than Francesca

1213
01:20:19,789 --> 01:20:22,056
you feel is more qualified?

1214
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:27,358
There are others
equal to the task.

1215
01:20:30,092 --> 01:20:31,896
Hmm?

1216
01:20:32,031 --> 01:20:34,299
Maybe wait to decide.

1217
01:20:43,548 --> 01:20:45,181
Where are we at with DG?

1218
01:20:45,316 --> 01:20:48,841
- Uh, I spoke to an assistant in Boyd Muir's office...
- Hmm.

1219
01:20:48,976 --> 01:20:51,447
...who said they weren't sure
why they decided

1220
01:20:51,583 --> 01:20:55,252
on a digital-only set,
what the criteria were.

1221
01:20:55,388 --> 01:20:57,122
But I do know they just did

1222
01:20:57,258 --> 01:20:58,790
a full-vinyl pressing
for Long Yu.

1223
01:20:58,926 --> 01:21:00,596
Of course they did.

1224
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:02,828
The Chinese market's incredible.

1225
01:21:02,963 --> 01:21:04,831
All right. Gloves off.

1226
01:21:04,967 --> 01:21:06,426
I'm going straight to Lucian.

1227
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:07,760
Maybe he needs to be reminded of

1228
01:21:07,895 --> 01:21:09,536
his Annenberg
Inclusion Initiative.

1229
01:21:11,273 --> 01:21:12,764
You've got
his contact details, right?

1230
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:16,077
Mm-hmm.
I'll send it to you right now.

1231
01:21:17,146 --> 01:21:21,144
My machine's misbehaving again.

1232
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:23,113
I've already spoken to I.T.

1233
01:21:23,248 --> 01:21:25,515
Just here... let me borrow yours.

1234
01:21:32,661 --> 01:21:34,458
Thank you.

1235
01:21:37,602 --> 01:21:39,331
Where's the match a?

1236
01:22:23,904 --> 01:22:25,745
Ah, I wasn't sure
where you were.

1237
01:22:25,881 --> 01:22:27,511
Was working out a kink.

1238
01:22:27,646 --> 01:22:29,950
The-the matcha's cold.
I-I'll get another.

1239
01:22:30,086 --> 01:22:31,377
It's all right.
I don't need it.

1240
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:33,583
Let's just keep working.

1241
01:22:40,931 --> 01:22:43,022
Francesca, you did as I asked

1242
01:22:43,157 --> 01:22:46,697
and deleted any and all
correspondence with Krista,

1243
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:48,499
correct?

1244
01:22:50,102 --> 01:22:53,207
Um, I'm not sure.

1245
01:22:54,174 --> 01:22:55,775
Uh, I'm-I'm... I'm not sure.

1246
01:22:55,911 --> 01:22:58,212
I-I'll double-check.

1247
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:08,086
You know,
Sebastian's leaving us,

1248
01:23:08,221 --> 01:23:09,882
and I wondered if you might, uh,

1249
01:23:10,017 --> 01:23:14,030
compile a list
of suitable replacements.

1250
01:23:18,598 --> 01:23:22,038
Uh, of course, feel free
to add your own name.

1251
01:23:25,076 --> 01:23:27,439
Thank you.

1252
01:23:28,707 --> 01:23:32,578
Oh, your-your lunch
with the new cellist.

1253
01:23:32,714 --> 01:23:33,839
Oh.

1254
01:23:33,974 --> 01:23:35,114
Meant to have you
reschedule that

1255
01:23:35,249 --> 01:23:36,915
'til after the orchestra votes.

1256
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:39,154
I'll text her now.

1257
01:23:40,922 --> 01:23:43,024
No, wait.

1258
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,857
Might as well
see what she's made of.

1259
01:23:54,266 --> 01:23:56,501
This food.

1260
01:23:58,109 --> 01:24:02,134
The cucumber salad's,
uh, very good.

1261
01:24:02,269 --> 01:24:04,141
It's kind of the only
real option in this place

1262
01:24:04,276 --> 01:24:05,779
if you're vegetarian.

1263
01:24:05,915 --> 01:24:07,615
Uh, do you eat fish?

1264
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:09,580
Not really.

1265
01:24:12,255 --> 01:24:15,614
You know, we can go
somewhere else.

1266
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,283
L-Like the Store Kitchen.

1267
01:24:17,418 --> 01:24:20,786
I mean, it's... uh, it's kind
of a silly tradition really

1268
01:24:20,921 --> 01:24:22,855
that new members
are brought here

1269
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:25,796
to sup with the ghosts
of the past.

1270
01:24:25,931 --> 01:24:28,832
I mean, at some point,
everyone from... from Napoleon

1271
01:24:28,968 --> 01:24:32,873
to Beethoven tucked in for
a meal at one of these tables.

1272
01:24:33,008 --> 01:24:35,204
Yes, and Clara Zetkin.

1273
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:36,902
I wonder which one.

1274
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:39,747
Who's that?
It's a, uh, musician?

1275
01:24:39,883 --> 01:24:41,547
No. She helped found

1276
01:24:41,682 --> 01:24:44,547
Social Democratic
women's movement in Germany

1277
01:24:44,683 --> 01:24:48,023
and KPD until
Hitler came to power

1278
01:24:48,158 --> 01:24:50,856
and she was exiled
to Soviet Union.

1279
01:24:50,992 --> 01:24:52,350
Clara Zetkin?

1280
01:24:52,486 --> 01:24:53,691
Yes.

1281
01:24:53,826 --> 01:24:56,161
Every March 8th, we place
flowers at her plaque

1282
01:24:56,296 --> 01:24:58,831
in Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

1283
01:24:58,967 --> 01:25:00,264
Her birthday?

1284
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,604
No, International Women's Day.

1285
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:08,408
Are you ready, Maestro?

1286
01:25:08,544 --> 01:25:12,874
- Yes, uh...
- Yes, first shashlik, then veal.

1287
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:16,215
- For you?
- Cucumber salad.

1288
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:17,714
- Thank you.
- Good choice.

1289
01:25:20,988 --> 01:25:22,919
Some more bread?

1290
01:25:23,055 --> 01:25:24,853
Hmm.

1291
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:31,697
It's good.
Would you like a bite?

1292
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:33,558
Oh, no.

1293
01:25:33,694 --> 01:25:35,501
No. Thank you.

1294
01:25:36,502 --> 01:25:38,200
Have you lived in Berlin long?

1295
01:25:38,335 --> 01:25:40,106
No, not at all.

1296
01:25:40,241 --> 01:25:41,639
I have friends in Wicker I visit

1297
01:25:41,774 --> 01:25:44,378
- until I know decision of orchestra.
- Hmm.

1298
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,048
Simonov will hold your place?

1299
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:50,186
Yes, I think so.
He is my uncle.

1300
01:25:51,512 --> 01:25:52,717
Oh.

1301
01:25:52,852 --> 01:25:55,547
But my dream has always been
to play with Berlin.

1302
01:25:55,682 --> 01:25:57,583
Oh, me, too.

1303
01:25:57,719 --> 01:25:59,789
There's nowhere like it.

1304
01:26:03,467 --> 01:26:07,203
I imagine, uh, Rostropovich
is a hero of yours.

1305
01:26:08,204 --> 01:26:10,303
Well, of course, he was great.

1306
01:26:10,439 --> 01:26:12,473
We study him
at Moscow Conservatory,

1307
01:26:12,609 --> 01:26:16,770
but growing up, my favorite
is Jacqueline du Pré.

1308
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:19,308
She made me want to play cello.

1309
01:26:19,444 --> 01:26:20,848
Which record was it?

1310
01:26:20,984 --> 01:26:23,575
Not record. YouTube.

1311
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:25,551
Elgar Concerto.

1312
01:26:27,286 --> 01:26:28,488
Oh, of course.

1313
01:26:28,623 --> 01:26:31,190
With Barenboim conducting
the London Phil.

1314
01:26:31,325 --> 01:26:34,127
I don't know who was conducting.

1315
01:26:34,262 --> 01:26:37,088
But she did something to me.

1316
01:26:37,224 --> 01:26:38,925
That's when I decide
to learn piece

1317
01:26:39,061 --> 01:26:41,433
and play it
with youth orchestra.

1318
01:26:41,569 --> 01:26:43,529
Quite a challenge.
How old were you?

1319
01:26:43,664 --> 01:26:45,406
Thirteen.

1320
01:26:46,809 --> 01:26:48,271
Wow.

1321
01:26:48,407 --> 01:26:50,212
I'd love to hear it.

1322
01:26:50,347 --> 01:26:53,249
They make video.
I will text to you.

1323
01:30:01,301 --> 01:30:03,032
Beautiful.

1324
01:30:12,778 --> 01:30:15,645
Now, um, just before we break,

1325
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:17,714
I know many of you are wondering

1326
01:30:17,849 --> 01:30:20,720
what the companion piece
will be.

1327
01:30:20,855 --> 01:30:23,349
And I have been
thinking quite a bit about it

1328
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:25,318
and was wondering
if we could just take

1329
01:30:25,454 --> 01:30:28,988
an informal poll about
possibly pairing the Five

1330
01:30:29,123 --> 01:30:31,995
with Elgar's Cello Concerto.

1331
01:30:57,991 --> 01:31:02,462
Oh, and, uh, given what
we've all been through,

1332
01:31:02,597 --> 01:31:04,193
what we're still going through,

1333
01:31:04,329 --> 01:31:08,867
and we're finally back
together as a family, I-I...

1334
01:31:10,034 --> 01:31:11,935
...I feel that
maybe the soloist

1335
01:31:12,071 --> 01:31:14,706
should come from
within our own ranks.

1336
01:31:14,841 --> 01:31:16,109
Yeah.

1337
01:31:17,678 --> 01:31:18,976
Good. Okay, good.

1338
01:31:19,112 --> 01:31:21,780
Just... Sorry.
One more question.

1339
01:31:21,916 --> 01:31:24,085
And this really is
just for you, Gosia.

1340
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:25,719
I mean...

1341
01:31:25,855 --> 01:31:28,453
...as a practical matter,
I mean, this would

1342
01:31:28,588 --> 01:31:30,617
normally fall to you.

1343
01:31:30,753 --> 01:31:33,395
But given how much is gonna be
asked of you with the Mahler,

1344
01:31:33,531 --> 01:31:35,263
I-I wondered if you'd be
at all bothered

1345
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:38,028
if we were to hold auditions?

1346
01:31:46,809 --> 01:31:50,271
Well, that's a bit unorthodox.

1347
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:56,341
But, in theory,
I have no objection.

1348
01:31:56,477 --> 01:31:57,816
My only hesitation
will depend on

1349
01:31:57,952 --> 01:31:59,420
when these auditions
might take place.

1350
01:31:59,555 --> 01:32:00,917
I wouldn't want them in any way

1351
01:32:01,052 --> 01:32:02,314
to interfere with
our sectionals.

1352
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:04,087
No, no, no.
That's a good point.

1353
01:32:04,222 --> 01:32:05,756
I mean, it is gonna
have to be a...

1354
01:32:05,891 --> 01:32:07,291
It's gonna have to be a sprint.

1355
01:32:07,426 --> 01:32:09,059
Um...

1356
01:32:10,497 --> 01:32:12,260
How about Monday?

1357
01:32:16,304 --> 01:32:17,969
All right.

1358
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:22,468
Okay, good.

1359
01:32:22,603 --> 01:32:25,607
Knut, would you assemble
a quorum for Monday?

1360
01:32:40,597 --> 01:32:42,790
Let me see what she says.

1361
01:32:42,926 --> 01:32:44,831
Okay, I got, I gotta go.

1362
01:32:46,092 --> 01:32:47,793
Britta, hi.

1363
01:32:47,928 --> 01:32:48,799
Lydia.

1364
01:32:48,934 --> 01:32:50,629
- Just caught the end.
- Ah!

1365
01:32:50,764 --> 01:32:52,536
What'd you think? How's it, uh,
how's it sounding?

1366
01:32:52,672 --> 01:32:54,840
Oh, it's fantastic.

1367
01:32:54,976 --> 01:32:57,169
I can't wait
until the live recording.

1368
01:32:57,305 --> 01:32:58,841
Yes, well.

1369
01:32:58,977 --> 01:33:01,414
I'll be happy when it's over.

1370
01:33:01,549 --> 01:33:03,181
It's always that way.

1371
01:33:03,317 --> 01:33:06,515
I know you're busy, and I don't
want to add to your load,

1372
01:33:06,650 --> 01:33:08,585
but...

1373
01:33:08,721 --> 01:33:10,823
Andris Davis called.

1374
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:14,162
Look, he's upset
I'm rotating Sebastian.

1375
01:33:14,298 --> 01:33:15,492
No, no, no, no, no.

1376
01:33:15,627 --> 01:33:16,828
Something else.

1377
01:33:16,963 --> 01:33:18,193
But you will please
let Laura know

1378
01:33:18,329 --> 01:33:19,600
as soon as you have chosen
his replacement

1379
01:33:19,735 --> 01:33:21,036
so she can prepare
a press release.

1380
01:33:21,171 --> 01:33:22,401
Yeah, of course.

1381
01:33:22,537 --> 01:33:24,201
Uh, so what did he want?

1382
01:33:24,336 --> 01:33:26,665
To complain about
the punctuality of a driver

1383
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,575
he seems to believe
the board supplies him with.

1384
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:31,737
Do you know anything about this?

1385
01:33:31,873 --> 01:33:33,045
Yes.

1386
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:36,045
No, it's just... it's just
something I pay for.

1387
01:33:36,181 --> 01:33:38,750
Then why does he believe
it's the board?

1388
01:33:38,885 --> 01:33:42,113
Because he needs
to believe that.

1389
01:33:42,248 --> 01:33:43,924
H-He needs to b...

1390
01:33:44,059 --> 01:33:46,519
needs to believe he hasn't
been forgotten, Britta.

1391
01:33:46,654 --> 01:33:49,227
Uh, the academy
has von Karajan's name on it,

1392
01:33:49,363 --> 01:33:51,856
and there are love shrines
to Abbado all over this place.

1393
01:33:51,992 --> 01:33:56,269
But the name of Davis, it's
essentially nowhere to be seen.

1394
01:33:56,404 --> 01:33:57,895
All right.

1395
01:33:58,031 --> 01:34:01,406
Then perhaps Francesca could
have a word with the driver.

1396
01:34:01,541 --> 01:34:03,705
Of course.

1397
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,707
One other thing.

1398
01:34:05,842 --> 01:34:07,544
It's unpleasant.

1399
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:09,075
Oh, is it?

1400
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:10,983
Operational shortfall?

1401
01:34:11,118 --> 01:34:13,580
Must I take Mrs. Sewing
out to drinks again?

1402
01:34:13,715 --> 01:34:15,581
No, no, no, nothing to do
with the orchestra.

1403
01:34:15,716 --> 01:34:17,753
Do you remember
an Accordion Academy fellow

1404
01:34:17,889 --> 01:34:20,388
named Krista Taylor?

1405
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:25,600
Yes. Why?

1406
01:34:25,736 --> 01:34:28,236
Apparently,
she committed suicide.

1407
01:34:28,372 --> 01:34:31,404
Oh, God. Poor thing.

1408
01:34:31,539 --> 01:34:33,469
Her parents mu...

1409
01:34:34,405 --> 01:34:37,007
Wait, sorry,
I'm... I'm confused, Britta.

1410
01:34:37,143 --> 01:34:39,414
Why, why were you put
in the position

1411
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:40,749
to deliver this terrible news?

1412
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:42,812
Why didn't Accordion
contact me directly?

1413
01:34:42,947 --> 01:34:44,817
It's delicate, Lydia.

1414
01:34:44,952 --> 01:34:46,420
Mr. Kaplan thought
it might be best

1415
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:47,822
if you contacted a lawyer

1416
01:34:47,957 --> 01:34:50,419
before speaking with anyone
at Accordion.

1417
01:34:50,555 --> 01:34:53,927
Well, presumably, that anyone
includes Eliot himself.

1418
01:34:55,933 --> 01:34:59,163
I'm, I'm sorry, why-why
would I need to do that?

1419
01:34:59,298 --> 01:35:03,739
Apparently, some accusations
have been made.

1420
01:35:05,304 --> 01:35:07,274
Accusations?
What kind of accusations?

1421
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:08,876
He didn't say.

1422
01:35:09,011 --> 01:35:11,275
But they were brought
to Accordion's counsel.

1423
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:14,339
Mr. Kaplan said he's certain
nothing will come of it,

1424
01:35:14,475 --> 01:35:17,082
but one can't be too careful.

1425
01:35:35,599 --> 01:35:38,037
I'm sorry about the hour.
It's Lydia Tár calling.

1426
01:35:38,172 --> 01:35:41,306
I need to speak to Mr. Singer
immediately.

1427
01:35:41,442 --> 01:35:42,706
Yes.

1428
01:35:42,841 --> 01:35:44,813
Yes, it's urgent.

1429
01:36:13,804 --> 01:36:15,844
Tired?

1430
01:36:18,876 --> 01:36:21,345
Sleep's elusive.

1431
01:36:22,248 --> 01:36:24,820
I was the same
before a recording date.

1432
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:28,186
Lydia...

1433
01:36:28,321 --> 01:36:31,920
are-are you absolutely
certain about Sebastian?

1434
01:36:32,056 --> 01:36:34,386
Mm-hmm.

1435
01:36:34,522 --> 01:36:37,223
Who will you replace him with?

1436
01:36:37,358 --> 01:36:39,595
Possibly Andrew Crust.

1437
01:36:40,498 --> 01:36:43,766
He's been assisting
Otto Tausk at the VSO.

1438
01:36:43,902 --> 01:36:46,369
Not the girl?

1439
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:57,281
Andris...

1440
01:37:00,515 --> 01:37:03,218
...have you ever had an issue

1441
01:37:03,353 --> 01:37:05,918
with a, a student or colleague,

1442
01:37:06,054 --> 01:37:08,060
where that person may have
misinterpreted your intention?

1443
01:37:08,196 --> 01:37:09,591
Has someone been complaining
about me?

1444
01:37:09,726 --> 01:37:11,665
- No, no, no, of course not.
- Because at this point,

1445
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,232
they've missed their chance.

1446
01:37:13,367 --> 01:37:15,435
- I'm out of the game.
- Yes, yes, I know, I know.

1447
01:37:15,570 --> 01:37:16,828
Course you are.

1448
01:37:16,963 --> 01:37:18,769
Thank God I was never pulled
from the podium

1449
01:37:18,904 --> 01:37:20,841
like Jimmy Levine.

1450
01:37:20,977 --> 01:37:24,735
Or-or hunted
like Charles Dutoit.

1451
01:37:24,871 --> 01:37:27,279
I take it you're asking
for a reason.

1452
01:37:27,415 --> 01:37:30,275
Well, there's just been
so much of this sort of thing

1453
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:31,945
in the news lately.

1454
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:35,386
Well, nowadays, to be accused
is the same as being guilty.

1455
01:37:36,322 --> 01:37:37,849
But I suppose
that was also the case

1456
01:37:37,984 --> 01:37:40,956
all those years ago
with Furtwängler.

1457
01:37:41,092 --> 01:37:44,229
A bit with Karajan, too.

1458
01:37:46,836 --> 01:37:49,500
Who was the better conductor?

1459
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:52,799
I never played
under Furtwängler.

1460
01:37:52,934 --> 01:37:55,170
Yeah, when I first arrived here,
the older members

1461
01:37:55,306 --> 01:37:58,476
had, uh, hmm, hushed opinions.

1462
01:37:58,612 --> 01:38:01,943
At the same time, they wanted
to leave that era behind.

1463
01:38:02,079 --> 01:38:03,474
What, the war?

1464
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:04,781
- No, postwar.
- Ah.

1465
01:38:04,916 --> 01:38:07,050
Denazification.

1466
01:38:07,185 --> 01:38:08,789
Someone pointed a finger at you,

1467
01:38:08,924 --> 01:38:10,858
process started all over again.

1468
01:38:10,994 --> 01:38:13,561
Furtwängler never joined
the Party.

1469
01:38:13,697 --> 01:38:14,962
Refused to give the salute

1470
01:38:15,098 --> 01:38:17,128
or to conduct the
"Horst-Wessel-Lied."

1471
01:38:17,264 --> 01:38:19,964
Or to sign his letters,
"Heil, Hitler."

1472
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:23,002
Even those he wrote to Hitler.

1473
01:38:23,138 --> 01:38:27,676
But he was obliged
to be denazified.

1474
01:38:27,811 --> 01:38:30,477
Until then, he was semiretired,

1475
01:38:30,612 --> 01:38:33,146
playing corpses.

1476
01:38:33,945 --> 01:38:35,982
Playing corpses?

1477
01:38:36,118 --> 01:38:39,449
Secretly performing
in a graveyard.

1478
01:38:40,981 --> 01:38:43,152
You're not equating
sexual impropriety

1479
01:38:43,287 --> 01:38:45,554
with being an accused Nazi?

1480
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:48,162
Either way, you had to be ready.

1481
01:38:48,298 --> 01:38:50,930
For years, I made sure
all the hangers in my closet

1482
01:38:51,065 --> 01:38:53,298
were facing the same direction.

1483
01:39:03,837 --> 01:39:06,707
How many are auditioning
on Monday?

1484
01:39:10,981 --> 01:39:12,515
No one.

1485
01:39:13,489 --> 01:39:15,155
No one?

1486
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:19,025
Maybe Martin.

1487
01:39:19,161 --> 01:39:20,886
He's never gotten along
with Gosia.

1488
01:39:21,021 --> 01:39:23,658
He would love to sit downstage
for once.

1489
01:39:25,325 --> 01:39:27,726
Well...

1490
01:39:27,862 --> 01:39:30,170
he's still gonna
have to audition.

1491
01:39:31,904 --> 01:39:33,806
Of course.

1492
01:39:33,942 --> 01:39:36,176
Have to follow the rules.

1493
01:39:38,006 --> 01:39:40,379
Aren't we being
a bit formal, Francesca?

1494
01:39:40,514 --> 01:39:43,050
From what I understand,
there's only one player, right?

1495
01:39:43,186 --> 01:39:46,087
No, Maestro, there are two.

1496
01:40:48,281 --> 01:40:50,149
Well, it's unanimous.

1497
01:40:50,284 --> 01:40:52,852
- Number two.
- Mm-hmm.

1498
01:40:52,987 --> 01:40:54,285
And we have a problem.

1499
01:40:54,421 --> 01:40:55,781
She's not officially
been invited

1500
01:40:55,917 --> 01:40:58,093
to become a member
of the orchestra.

1501
01:40:59,262 --> 01:41:02,559
Well, she wouldn't need to be
to solo for us.

1502
01:41:02,694 --> 01:41:04,797
I believe the criteria
of the audition

1503
01:41:04,933 --> 01:41:07,325
was all section members?

1504
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:09,665
- Then her audition gets thrown out.
- No.

1505
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:12,169
Francesca, please ask Martin
to come back in

1506
01:41:12,304 --> 01:41:14,499
so we can give him the news.

1507
01:41:14,635 --> 01:41:16,639
Wait. Gosia, let's talk.

1508
01:41:19,011 --> 01:41:21,473
Shit!

1509
01:41:22,813 --> 01:41:25,219
Yeah!

1510
01:41:26,553 --> 01:41:29,920
I'll confirm solo rehearsal
dates with her.

1511
01:41:30,055 --> 01:41:31,889
Thank you.

1512
01:41:32,024 --> 01:41:34,228
Have a seat.

1513
01:41:38,463 --> 01:41:40,397
I have made a decision

1514
01:41:40,533 --> 01:41:43,336
regarding Sebastian's
replacement.

1515
01:41:44,473 --> 01:41:48,209
And I want you to know
it wasn't an easy one.

1516
01:41:49,544 --> 01:41:53,876
Uh, this position brings with it
enormous responsibility,

1517
01:41:54,011 --> 01:41:57,341
and my personal affection for you aside...

1518
01:41:57,477 --> 01:42:02,355
...I will have to go with
someone more, more experienced.

1519
01:43:02,149 --> 01:43:04,081
Oh, leave me alone.

1520
01:43:04,217 --> 01:43:06,584
I don't have your paper.

1521
01:43:07,452 --> 01:43:09,286
I've told you before, I...

1522
01:43:09,422 --> 01:43:11,622
Oh, I'm sorry. Please come in.

1523
01:43:57,631 --> 01:43:58,835
Good. Good.

1524
01:43:58,970 --> 01:44:01,900
I-I think the contrast is,
it's much better now.

1525
01:44:02,035 --> 01:44:03,408
- Don't you think?
- Hmm.

1526
01:44:03,544 --> 01:44:05,306
How do you take your coffee?

1527
01:44:05,442 --> 01:44:07,678
Black. Strong.

1528
01:44:09,315 --> 01:44:11,142
Is all right if I play?

1529
01:44:11,277 --> 01:44:13,783
Hmm? Oh, yes,
of course, of course.

1530
01:45:02,271 --> 01:45:04,728
That's as far as I've gotten.

1531
01:45:04,864 --> 01:45:06,874
But it's good.

1532
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:09,575
Um, this part here.

1533
01:45:13,347 --> 01:45:15,713
Maybe change A to B-flat?

1534
01:45:19,422 --> 01:45:21,884
That's better.
I like that sound.

1535
01:45:23,521 --> 01:45:25,760
Come on. Take a break.

1536
01:45:25,895 --> 01:45:27,857
Okay.

1537
01:45:40,242 --> 01:45:41,739
<i>Sharon?</i>

1538
01:45:45,045 --> 01:45:46,909
Hello.

1539
01:46:02,722 --> 01:46:04,564
Petra.

1540
01:46:30,325 --> 01:46:32,150
What are you doing in here?

1541
01:46:32,286 --> 01:46:35,194
I'm hiding from her.

1542
01:46:35,330 --> 01:46:36,696
Why?

1543
01:46:36,831 --> 01:46:39,858
Because she told me
to put my things in order,

1544
01:46:39,993 --> 01:46:42,833
but they already are.

1545
01:46:45,601 --> 01:46:47,805
I can see that.

1546
01:46:48,801 --> 01:46:49,968
Come on.

1547
01:46:50,103 --> 01:46:51,973
They're all waiting for you.

1548
01:46:52,109 --> 01:46:55,347
I'm going to give
everyone a pencil.

1549
01:46:55,482 --> 01:46:56,645
All of them?

1550
01:46:56,781 --> 01:46:58,310
They can't all conduct, honey.

1551
01:46:58,445 --> 01:47:01,984
It's not a,
it's not a democracy.

1552
01:48:07,617 --> 01:48:09,221
Okay, uh...

1553
01:48:15,454 --> 01:48:18,090
- Hey, that's good.
- Yeah. Good.

1554
01:48:18,225 --> 01:48:19,331
You happy?

1555
01:48:22,903 --> 01:48:25,739
How long were you acquainted
with Miss Taylor?

1556
01:48:25,874 --> 01:48:29,839
Oh, I'd have to double-check
with my assistant,

1557
01:48:29,974 --> 01:48:32,776
but cumulatively speaking,
I'd say

1558
01:48:32,912 --> 01:48:35,474
- not more than a few months.
- Hmm.

1559
01:48:35,609 --> 01:48:38,215
- Thank you for your time, Maestro.
- Not at all.

1560
01:48:39,385 --> 01:48:41,612
- This recording will exist on a protected server...
- Mm-hmm.

1561
01:48:41,747 --> 01:48:43,919
...under attorney-client
privilege with Mr. Singer.

1562
01:48:44,055 --> 01:48:45,657
- Great.
- He will follow up with you

1563
01:48:45,793 --> 01:48:47,661
to help prepare
for the deposition.

1564
01:48:50,957 --> 01:48:52,756
Deposition?

1565
01:48:52,892 --> 01:48:54,267
Yes.

1566
01:48:54,403 --> 01:48:56,098
I assumed you were aware.

1567
01:48:56,233 --> 01:48:58,270
Mr. Singer's office said
they'd been coordinating

1568
01:48:58,406 --> 01:49:00,303
with your assistant.

1569
01:49:00,438 --> 01:49:02,834
Francesca, you'd better get
your pretty little ass to work

1570
01:49:02,969 --> 01:49:04,510
right now.

1571
01:49:06,178 --> 01:49:08,046
The only communication
we've received from Francesca

1572
01:49:08,182 --> 01:49:10,341
was an email to my assistant
in the middle of the night

1573
01:49:10,477 --> 01:49:11,814
tendering her immediate
resignation,

1574
01:49:11,949 --> 01:49:13,620
stating she would be in contact

1575
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:16,113
when she had more details
to provide.

1576
01:49:16,248 --> 01:49:17,620
What kind of details?

1577
01:49:17,756 --> 01:49:19,188
A new address, I suppose.

1578
01:49:19,323 --> 01:49:21,561
In the meantime,
we've been trying all morning

1579
01:49:21,697 --> 01:49:23,296
to find someone suitable
to assist you

1580
01:49:23,431 --> 01:49:24,632
on a temporary basis.

1581
01:49:24,767 --> 01:49:26,463
For now, perhaps
your new assistant conductor

1582
01:49:26,599 --> 01:49:28,033
would be the right fit.

1583
01:49:28,169 --> 01:49:30,534
No. No. He's not available
'til after the live Five date.

1584
01:49:30,670 --> 01:49:32,772
Yes, I'm ready. Let's go.

1585
01:49:36,778 --> 01:49:38,544
I know how much
you depended on her.

1586
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:40,038
Two-faced little bitch.

1587
01:49:40,173 --> 01:49:41,639
Imagine her hurt, Tár.

1588
01:49:41,775 --> 01:49:44,142
- Don't you dare try to defend her.
- God, slow down!

1589
01:49:44,277 --> 01:49:45,810
She'll come galumphing back.

1590
01:49:45,945 --> 01:49:47,822
- I mean, I've got a dumb phone like every robot.
- Tár, s...

1591
01:49:47,957 --> 01:49:50,021
How hard can it be to text all day?

1592
01:49:50,157 --> 01:49:52,554
Slow down!

1593
01:49:52,690 --> 01:49:55,025
Or let me out!

1594
01:50:15,915 --> 01:50:18,147
Francesca!

1595
01:50:51,183 --> 01:50:53,886
Fräulein?

1596
01:51:43,403 --> 01:51:44,634
Come.

1597
01:53:20,902 --> 01:53:22,534
Sorry I'm late again.

1598
01:53:22,670 --> 01:53:24,766
Oh.

1599
01:53:29,512 --> 01:53:32,203
D-Do you live here?

1600
01:53:32,338 --> 01:53:34,547
Not normally, no.

1601
01:53:34,683 --> 01:53:36,044
Uh, make yourself at home.

1602
01:53:36,179 --> 01:53:37,483
I'm just gonna put something on.

1603
01:53:37,619 --> 01:53:39,084
Do you have a towel?

1604
01:53:41,185 --> 01:53:43,550
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1605
01:53:48,697 --> 01:53:51,426
I got caught in the rain.

1606
01:54:02,573 --> 01:54:05,136
There is small concert
with musician friends.

1607
01:54:05,271 --> 01:54:06,608
You should come.

1608
01:54:07,712 --> 01:54:11,246
Thanks, but I-I...
really must get home.

1609
01:54:11,381 --> 01:54:14,421
- You have child, yes?
- Mm-hmm.

1610
01:54:14,557 --> 01:54:16,253
I will not do that.

1611
01:54:18,584 --> 01:54:20,389
Pets are better for some people.

1612
01:54:23,227 --> 01:54:25,999
Oh.

1613
01:54:33,266 --> 01:54:34,364
What... Oh.

1614
01:54:34,499 --> 01:54:35,699
- Sorry.
- Bye.

1615
01:54:35,834 --> 01:54:36,938
Oh, yes. Goodbye. Yes.

1616
01:54:37,074 --> 01:54:38,436
- Goodbye.
- Okay.

1617
01:54:38,572 --> 01:54:40,409
- Oh.
- Okay.

1618
01:54:47,346 --> 01:54:49,113
Oh, Olga!

1619
01:54:49,248 --> 01:54:50,353
Olga!

1620
01:54:58,367 --> 01:55:00,165
Olga?

1621
01:55:06,771 --> 01:55:08,943
Olga?

1622
01:55:37,230 --> 01:55:38,973
Hello?

1623
01:55:50,683 --> 01:55:52,382
Olga?

1624
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,666
Olga?

1625
01:56:21,846 --> 01:56:23,210
Olga?

1626
01:57:10,756 --> 01:57:12,757
Why didn't you go to the police?

1627
01:57:12,892 --> 01:57:15,729
I fought. He ran.
What's to tell?

1628
01:57:19,398 --> 01:57:20,503
Oh, God.

1629
01:57:20,638 --> 01:57:21,708
I'm gonna get you something
for the pain.

1630
01:57:21,844 --> 01:57:22,776
No, I don't need anything.

1631
01:57:22,911 --> 01:57:24,938
No, I'm gonna get you something.

1632
01:57:31,114 --> 01:57:32,746
<i>Ja.</i>

1633
01:57:48,267 --> 01:57:50,764
Lydia!

1634
01:57:53,432 --> 01:57:54,330
Lydia!

1635
01:58:00,143 --> 01:58:02,116
What is it?

1636
01:58:04,181 --> 01:58:06,285
Hold my foot.

1637
01:58:14,619 --> 01:58:15,989
Is that better?

1638
01:58:16,125 --> 01:58:17,692
Yes.

1639
01:58:59,003 --> 01:59:00,702
Okay.

1640
01:59:00,837 --> 01:59:03,507
Let's, uh, shoo the elephant
from the room.

1641
01:59:04,609 --> 01:59:07,280
"What the hell happened
to her face?"

1642
01:59:07,415 --> 01:59:09,713
"Did she, uh, schedule
a nose and eye job

1643
01:59:09,849 --> 01:59:12,477
and bail before the surgeon
finished the other half?"

1644
01:59:17,692 --> 01:59:19,419
No.

1645
01:59:19,555 --> 01:59:21,089
I was, uh, I was attacked.

1646
01:59:21,224 --> 01:59:23,620
Thank you.

1647
01:59:23,755 --> 01:59:25,596
I'm fine. Really.

1648
01:59:25,731 --> 01:59:27,568
Should've seen the other guy.

1649
01:59:27,703 --> 01:59:28,592
All right.

1650
02:00:13,915 --> 02:00:15,440
Don't.

1651
02:00:15,575 --> 02:00:17,113
It burns.

1652
02:00:17,249 --> 02:00:19,282
You must see the doctor.

1653
02:00:19,417 --> 02:00:21,185
He's booked 'til next week.

1654
02:00:21,321 --> 02:00:22,519
I'll call them again

1655
02:00:22,655 --> 02:00:24,182
and tell them how much pain
you're in.

1656
02:00:24,317 --> 02:00:26,692
No, no, let's just,
let's just finish up here.

1657
02:00:26,827 --> 02:00:28,293
Okay?

1658
02:00:28,429 --> 02:00:30,326
Overall, the balance
feels right.

1659
02:00:30,461 --> 02:00:31,693
Other than a quick brush up,

1660
02:00:31,828 --> 02:00:34,229
we should concentrate
on the Elgar.

1661
02:00:34,365 --> 02:00:37,033
You're certain of that?

1662
02:00:37,168 --> 02:00:39,472
I think so. Yes.

1663
02:00:39,608 --> 02:00:41,341
<i>We're absolutely
rock-solid there,</i>

1664
02:00:41,476 --> 02:00:46,170
but I am going to try
to hold them back here.

1665
02:00:46,305 --> 02:00:47,975
Uh, they're just
getting caught up in the power

1666
02:00:48,110 --> 02:00:51,916
of your, uh, glissando
in there, trying to match it.

1667
02:00:52,051 --> 02:00:55,022
Um, probably...

1668
02:00:55,157 --> 02:00:57,648
Where were you attacked,
Maestro?

1669
02:00:57,784 --> 02:01:00,694
Oh, doesn't matter.

1670
02:01:00,829 --> 02:01:02,324
Here.

1671
02:01:02,459 --> 02:01:05,655
Thank you.

1672
02:01:05,791 --> 02:01:07,228
There you are.

1673
02:01:08,131 --> 02:01:10,398
- When did this fall happen?
- Uh, it's all a blur.

1674
02:01:10,533 --> 02:01:13,204
Three, four days ago.

1675
02:01:13,339 --> 02:01:14,738
It's just my shoulder. Yeah.

1676
02:01:14,873 --> 02:01:18,543
It kind of burns,
like I fell asleep by the pool.

1677
02:01:19,678 --> 02:01:22,840
Okay, you can
put your shirt back on.

1678
02:01:22,975 --> 02:01:24,184
You've damaged some nerves.

1679
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:25,513
The burning sensation
you're feeling

1680
02:01:25,648 --> 02:01:27,182
is called notalgia paresthetica.

1681
02:01:27,317 --> 02:01:28,415
Nostalgia?

1682
02:01:28,551 --> 02:01:30,752
"Notalgia." No "S."

1683
02:01:30,888 --> 02:01:33,289
- Well, how do we treat it?
- You don't.

1684
02:01:33,425 --> 02:01:34,758
Eventually, it goes away.

1685
02:01:34,894 --> 02:01:38,332
An adjustment might help.
You're somewhat crooked.

1686
02:02:26,714 --> 02:02:28,578
Oh, well, then you must be

1687
02:02:28,714 --> 02:02:32,111
a Negro product
exploited by the Jews.

1688
02:02:33,580 --> 02:02:36,418
Now let's turn our gaze back
to the piano bench up there

1689
02:02:36,554 --> 02:02:38,788
to a super hot young woman.

1690
02:02:39,890 --> 02:02:41,918
That's-that's...
th-that was very good.

1691
02:02:42,054 --> 02:02:44,089
Now, you could masturbate,

1692
02:02:44,225 --> 02:02:47,830
but what are you
actually doing to me?

1693
02:02:53,439 --> 02:02:54,805
- Britta.
- Hi, hi.

1694
02:02:54,940 --> 02:02:57,671
- Have you seen it?
- Yes, yes. I've just seen it.

1695
02:02:57,807 --> 02:03:00,776
...gathering this afternoon.

1696
02:03:00,911 --> 02:03:02,810
- This afternoon?
- Is that a problem?

1697
02:03:02,946 --> 02:03:05,144
No, just...
No, it's no problem.

1698
02:03:38,777 --> 02:03:44,314
First of all, that class was
conducted in a tech-free zone.

1699
02:03:44,450 --> 02:03:48,057
And second,
whoever violated that rule

1700
02:03:48,192 --> 02:03:51,428
edited what we've all seen
to create linguistic traps

1701
02:03:51,563 --> 02:03:53,028
to completely redefine my words.

1702
02:03:53,164 --> 02:03:55,326
I mean, look at the
reverse shots on the students.

1703
02:03:55,461 --> 02:03:57,168
There's no way that was done
in real time.

1704
02:03:57,304 --> 02:03:58,600
It's a hatchet job.

1705
02:03:58,735 --> 02:04:00,697
I'm sure that's true, Lydia.

1706
02:04:00,832 --> 02:04:04,511
And were it just this video,
we would not be sitting here.

1707
02:04:04,646 --> 02:04:06,175
Unfortunately,
it's linked to an article in

1708
02:04:06,311 --> 02:04:08,712
the<i> New York Post</i> regarding
Krista Taylor's suicide,

1709
02:04:08,847 --> 02:04:11,614
which alludes to
other Accordion fellows

1710
02:04:11,749 --> 02:04:13,619
they claim to have interviewed.

1711
02:04:13,755 --> 02:04:15,846
Laura, can you tell us
about your conversations?

1712
02:04:15,982 --> 02:04:17,190
We haven't had any.

1713
02:04:17,326 --> 02:04:18,858
Obviously, we gave no response

1714
02:04:18,993 --> 02:04:21,527
- as we first wanted to meet to discuss strategy.
- Mm-hmm.

1715
02:04:21,663 --> 02:04:23,992
- Here's the article.
- Thank you, Laura.

1716
02:04:28,395 --> 02:04:31,637
"Enticed and groomed
multiple young women

1717
02:04:31,772 --> 02:04:34,630
"to engage in sex acts
for professional favors.

1718
02:04:34,766 --> 02:04:37,275
Blocked opportunities
to those who didn't comply."

1719
02:04:37,410 --> 02:04:39,710
This is total fiction.

1720
02:04:39,846 --> 02:04:42,138
And the<i> Post</i> is
a how-de-do scandal rag.

1721
02:04:42,273 --> 02:04:45,013
No serious person reads it.

1722
02:04:47,853 --> 02:04:51,552
And so far as
Krista Taylor goes,

1723
02:04:51,687 --> 02:04:53,049
she was disturbed.

1724
02:04:53,185 --> 02:04:55,159
I mean, she fixated on me.

1725
02:04:55,294 --> 02:04:57,063
In what way?

1726
02:04:57,199 --> 02:04:58,494
She sent me weird gifts.

1727
02:04:58,629 --> 02:05:00,163
She trolled me online.

1728
02:05:00,298 --> 02:05:03,099
- She tried to send me signals.
- Well, what kind of signals?

1729
02:05:03,235 --> 02:05:06,395
She vandalized my Wikipedia
page to say she was my muse.

1730
02:05:06,531 --> 02:05:08,774
I mean,
that's easily checked, right?

1731
02:05:08,909 --> 02:05:12,546
And did you ever report this
or file a complaint?

1732
02:05:14,114 --> 02:05:15,572
No.

1733
02:05:15,708 --> 02:05:18,283
No. And I... Look, I probably,
I probably should have.

1734
02:05:18,419 --> 02:05:20,784
I... I felt sorry for her.

1735
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:22,512
Is this something
you shared with Sharon?

1736
02:05:22,647 --> 02:05:24,415
No. I didn't want
to burden her with it.

1737
02:05:24,551 --> 02:05:26,424
- Don't you think you should have?
- Yes. Yes.

1738
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:28,123
Well, what-what do you advise?

1739
02:05:28,258 --> 02:05:30,754
Well, for now, it hasn't gotten
all that much traction.

1740
02:05:30,889 --> 02:05:33,457
None of the trades have linked
to it or called for comment.

1741
02:05:33,592 --> 02:05:35,901
- So I say let's see what happens.
- Mm-hmm.

1742
02:05:37,137 --> 02:05:40,605
We wanted to give you as much
warning as possible, Lydia,

1743
02:05:40,741 --> 02:05:42,674
before this Friday's
donor meeting.

1744
02:05:42,810 --> 02:05:44,609
Well, unfortunately,
I won't be there.

1745
02:05:44,745 --> 02:05:46,941
Well, I very much advise
that you are.

1746
02:05:47,077 --> 02:05:48,776
I have the book launch
in New York

1747
02:05:48,911 --> 02:05:51,618
and apparently a deposition.

1748
02:05:52,853 --> 02:05:55,853
Well, we'll fill you in
upon your return, then.

1749
02:05:58,425 --> 02:06:00,187
Enjoy your weekend.

1750
02:06:02,427 --> 02:06:04,493
Starving.

1751
02:06:04,629 --> 02:06:06,228
Finished my thing today.

1752
02:06:06,363 --> 02:06:09,235
Congratulations.
We should go out and celebrate.

1753
02:06:09,370 --> 02:06:11,194
I can't. I gotta pack.

1754
02:06:11,330 --> 02:06:13,101
- Hi!
- Hi, Lydia.

1755
02:06:18,511 --> 02:06:20,344
Sharon?

1756
02:06:20,479 --> 02:06:22,582
Yeah?

1757
02:06:22,718 --> 02:06:24,476
You seen my performance score?

1758
02:06:24,611 --> 02:06:26,848
No. Why?
Isn't it with the other ones?

1759
02:06:26,983 --> 02:06:28,884
No. No, it's not.

1760
02:06:29,020 --> 02:06:31,724
Are you sure
it's not in my office?

1761
02:06:34,058 --> 02:06:36,828
Yeah, what about
the orchestra library?

1762
02:06:38,458 --> 02:06:40,997
Yeah, can you
check again, please?

1763
02:06:43,735 --> 02:06:46,299
I don't know. Yes, exactly.

1764
02:07:03,315 --> 02:07:05,454
Lydia?

1765
02:07:08,019 --> 02:07:09,427
Yes?

1766
02:07:09,562 --> 02:07:12,297
When will you be back?

1767
02:07:12,433 --> 02:07:14,596
The day after tomorrow.

1768
02:07:14,731 --> 02:07:16,432
Will you promise?

1769
02:07:16,567 --> 02:07:18,936
Yes, I promise.

1770
02:07:29,342 --> 02:07:31,751
- Good night.
- Good night.

1771
02:07:45,897 --> 02:07:48,167
Thanks.
Do you have any bottles?

1772
02:07:48,302 --> 02:07:49,597
Of course.

1773
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:52,737
Do you need anything else
before I close the cabin door?

1774
02:07:52,873 --> 02:07:55,940
Uh, yes.
Uh, we're waiting on one more.

1775
02:08:02,541 --> 02:08:03,847
<i>To all my questions</i>

1776
02:08:03,983 --> 02:08:05,649
pertaining to
your communications

1777
02:08:05,785 --> 02:08:08,421
with Krista Taylor and others,

1778
02:08:08,557 --> 02:08:10,954
your answers have always been

1779
02:08:11,089 --> 02:08:15,894
"I don't know"
or "I don't remember."

1780
02:08:18,063 --> 02:08:19,589
Is there anything
I could show you

1781
02:08:19,725 --> 02:08:22,602
that might help refresh
your recollection?

1782
02:08:22,737 --> 02:08:25,200
Any documents,
such as emails from you

1783
02:08:25,335 --> 02:08:27,798
or your personal assistant,
Miss Lentini,

1784
02:08:27,934 --> 02:08:31,943
that might help you recall
what you did and didn't say?

1785
02:08:39,983 --> 02:08:41,720
I guess you heard by now.

1786
02:08:41,856 --> 02:08:44,791
Bryant Park bumped you
to 53rd Street.

1787
02:08:47,919 --> 02:08:50,962
This is the Kaplan Fund's
prepared statement.

1788
02:08:52,997 --> 02:08:54,525
I'm sorry to say this is likely

1789
02:08:54,660 --> 02:08:56,033
the last time
we'll see each other.

1790
02:08:56,168 --> 02:08:58,461
Well, now I can buy
my own plane tickets.

1791
02:08:58,596 --> 02:08:59,971
And you can bother someone else

1792
02:09:00,106 --> 02:09:03,540
to try and teach you
to crawl to the podium.

1793
02:09:21,024 --> 02:09:23,392
Is there a back entrance?

1794
02:09:23,527 --> 02:09:27,733
"Indeed, the common metaphors
used to explain music

1795
02:09:27,869 --> 02:09:29,933
"are based on
the idea that music

1796
02:09:30,069 --> 02:09:34,664
"is a language,
albeit a secret one.

1797
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:39,879
"And in this way,
holy and unknowable.

1798
02:09:41,511 --> 02:09:45,083
"These joyful noises we make
being the closest thing

1799
02:09:45,219 --> 02:09:49,185
"any of us might ever
experience to the divine...

1800
02:09:50,489 --> 02:09:55,488
"... yet something born by
the mere act of moving air.

1801
02:09:57,665 --> 02:10:00,262
No different than birdsong."

1802
02:10:09,033 --> 02:10:11,373
So, meet downstairs
in half an hour for dinner?

1803
02:10:11,508 --> 02:10:14,210
Thank you, but I am jet-lagged.
I go to sleep now.

1804
02:10:14,345 --> 02:10:18,412
Yeah, me, too.
I'll... probably do the same.

1805
02:11:17,107 --> 02:11:18,701
Yes, hello.

1806
02:11:18,837 --> 02:11:21,614
Yes, there's no water
in my room.

1807
02:11:21,750 --> 02:11:23,774
Yes, I've checked the minibar.

1808
02:11:23,910 --> 02:11:26,214
How long would it take
to get a bottle of water?

1809
02:11:26,350 --> 02:11:29,120
Uh, don't worry.
I'll just come down.

1810
02:11:32,023 --> 02:11:33,619
Lobby, please.

1811
02:12:00,478 --> 02:12:03,312
Oh, Jesus.

1812
02:12:15,626 --> 02:12:18,136
It was Britta.

1813
02:12:18,967 --> 02:12:20,730
Right?

1814
02:12:20,866 --> 02:12:22,700
I mean, that is
how you heard about

1815
02:12:22,835 --> 02:12:25,375
these millennial robots
trading in lies.

1816
02:12:25,510 --> 02:12:28,178
I couldn't care less about
the Juilliard thing.

1817
02:12:28,313 --> 02:12:30,339
Too much time on her hands.

1818
02:12:30,475 --> 02:12:31,714
She's fringe.

1819
02:12:31,849 --> 02:12:34,052
The worst kind.

1820
02:12:34,187 --> 02:12:36,255
Every time
I walk out of this house,

1821
02:12:36,390 --> 02:12:40,016
she's in your ear with intrigue
or she's asking me about

1822
02:12:40,152 --> 02:12:43,293
some other piece of fringe,
like Samantha Hankey.

1823
02:12:43,428 --> 02:12:46,395
God, a nobody
who has nothing better to do

1824
02:12:46,531 --> 02:12:50,867
than drop my name at lunch
and imply things.

1825
02:12:51,002 --> 02:12:52,604
I feel sorry for you.

1826
02:12:52,739 --> 02:12:54,733
Save it.

1827
02:12:55,734 --> 02:12:58,110
I tried calling you last night.

1828
02:13:00,045 --> 02:13:02,714
Did you have fun with her?

1829
02:13:02,849 --> 02:13:05,649
My back is killing me.

1830
02:13:05,784 --> 02:13:07,043
Francesca left,

1831
02:13:07,178 --> 02:13:09,614
and I simply needed someone
to carry my bags.

1832
02:13:09,750 --> 02:13:11,657
I mean, who was I
supposed to ask?

1833
02:13:11,793 --> 02:13:14,726
To go with me? Hmm? Knut?

1834
02:13:14,862 --> 02:13:16,294
Jesus fucking...

1835
02:13:16,430 --> 02:13:18,622
There are many things
I accept about you.

1836
02:13:18,757 --> 02:13:20,133
And in the end,

1837
02:13:20,268 --> 02:13:24,060
I'm sure I could get over
something like this.

1838
02:13:24,195 --> 02:13:27,073
But that's not what
we're talking about, is it?

1839
02:13:29,534 --> 02:13:30,835
These accusations

1840
02:13:30,970 --> 02:13:34,113
from the parents of the girl
who suicided?

1841
02:13:39,143 --> 02:13:41,747
You honestly believe
what they're saying?

1842
02:13:45,924 --> 02:13:47,588
They're lies.

1843
02:13:49,328 --> 02:13:51,029
Do you understand
what it was like

1844
02:13:51,165 --> 02:13:53,165
to walk into
my sectional yesterday

1845
02:13:53,300 --> 02:13:56,160
and to see everybody
whispering about me?

1846
02:13:56,295 --> 02:14:00,837
It's got nothing to do with
what they're accusing you of.

1847
02:14:00,973 --> 02:14:02,934
It's a simple matter

1848
02:14:03,069 --> 02:14:06,443
of not warning me
that our family is in danger.

1849
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:09,447
And what good
would that have done?

1850
02:14:09,583 --> 02:14:12,516
I mean, what could you possibly
do to make things better?

1851
02:14:14,987 --> 02:14:17,183
Because I deserve that.

1852
02:14:17,319 --> 02:14:19,455
Those are the rules.

1853
02:14:20,424 --> 02:14:22,859
You are to ask
for my fucking counsel,

1854
02:14:22,995 --> 02:14:24,955
the way you always have.

1855
02:14:25,090 --> 02:14:26,794
The way you did
when you first arrived here

1856
02:14:26,930 --> 02:14:29,793
as a guest conductor looking
for a permanent position.

1857
02:14:29,929 --> 02:14:32,204
You asked me
what were the politics,

1858
02:14:32,339 --> 02:14:35,297
what were the moves,
how could we swing it.

1859
02:14:37,975 --> 02:14:39,641
Of course...

1860
02:14:39,776 --> 02:14:43,176
these conversations
took place in another bed.

1861
02:14:43,312 --> 02:14:46,010
Or rather, the couch

1862
02:14:46,145 --> 02:14:48,478
of that horrible place
you still can't let go of.

1863
02:14:48,614 --> 02:14:51,289
Old sorrow blows in.

1864
02:14:52,825 --> 02:14:57,295
How cruel of you to define our
relationship as transactional.

1865
02:15:00,458 --> 02:15:04,500
There's only one relationship
you've ever had that wasn't.

1866
02:15:04,635 --> 02:15:07,570
And she is sleeping
in the room next door.

1867
02:15:07,705 --> 02:15:10,803
Apparently, this hasn't even
crossed your mind.

1868
02:17:23,373 --> 02:17:25,476
Petra!

1869
02:17:28,048 --> 02:17:29,711
Come here, darling.

1870
02:17:32,120 --> 02:17:33,317
- It was good.
- Was it?

1871
02:17:33,453 --> 02:17:35,784
- Yeah.
- You want to go to the park?

1872
02:17:36,654 --> 02:17:38,757
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.

1873
02:17:38,893 --> 02:17:40,491
Please don't.

1874
02:18:06,516 --> 02:18:09,012
Hello. I am Anna Franzen.

1875
02:18:09,148 --> 02:18:11,984
This is
my late mother's apartment.

1876
02:18:13,417 --> 02:18:16,795
Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry
about your mother.

1877
02:18:16,930 --> 02:18:19,029
Thank you.

1878
02:18:19,165 --> 02:18:21,192
How's your sister doing?

1879
02:18:21,327 --> 02:18:24,398
Eleanor lives now
in a facility in Neukölln.

1880
02:18:24,534 --> 02:18:26,229
I'm sorry to trouble you,

1881
02:18:26,364 --> 02:18:29,538
but my husband and I
are selling the place

1882
02:18:29,674 --> 02:18:33,777
and couldn't help
hearing the music.

1883
02:18:33,913 --> 02:18:35,038
Oh.

1884
02:18:35,173 --> 02:18:36,545
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1885
02:18:36,681 --> 02:18:38,248
We were wondering if there are

1886
02:18:38,383 --> 02:18:40,210
specific hours you rehearse,

1887
02:18:40,345 --> 02:18:43,016
so we can schedule showings
around them.

1888
02:18:44,052 --> 02:18:46,892
We don't want to scare
potential buyers off

1889
02:18:47,028 --> 02:18:49,390
with all the noise.

1890
02:18:49,525 --> 02:18:51,993
Oh, no.

1891
02:18:52,129 --> 02:18:53,128
No.

1892
02:18:55,367 --> 02:18:57,264
No, we wouldn't want that.

Come on, give me some eyes!

1905
02:21:45,965 --> 02:21:47,705
Lydia.

1906
02:21:48,538 --> 02:21:51,267
This is my score.

1907
02:21:51,402 --> 02:21:53,612
Lydia, you're confused.

1908
02:21:53,747 --> 02:21:55,580
It's my score!

1909
02:21:55,716 --> 02:21:59,112
You fucking little nothing!

1910
02:22:07,394 --> 02:22:08,425
I'm fine.

1911
02:22:38,085 --> 02:22:40,691
You sign CAMI voucher.

1912
02:23:02,681 --> 02:23:05,147
Good afternoon. CAMI.

1913
02:23:05,283 --> 02:23:06,851
Hold on.

1914
02:23:07,787 --> 02:23:09,316
Normally, I'd think Lisa Rich

1915
02:23:09,452 --> 02:23:11,921
in our booking department
would be a great fit for you,

1916
02:23:12,056 --> 02:23:14,350
but she's just got
too much on her plate.

1917
02:23:14,486 --> 02:23:17,828
So, I'd like to team you
with Jake here.

1918
02:23:17,963 --> 02:23:20,365
Jake, you want to,
you want to show Lydia

1919
02:23:20,501 --> 02:23:21,999
what you've prepared for her?

1920
02:23:22,135 --> 02:23:24,334
Well...

1921
02:23:24,470 --> 02:23:26,770
right now it's a reset.

1922
02:23:26,905 --> 02:23:28,536
What we're after is less,
not more.

1923
02:23:28,672 --> 02:23:29,773
We want to be selective

1924
02:23:29,908 --> 02:23:31,839
and rebuild this
from the ground up.

1925
02:23:31,974 --> 02:23:33,976
That means we need a new story.

1926
02:23:38,485 --> 02:23:40,184
Just here.

1927
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:41,914
Here. Thank you.

1928
02:23:42,049 --> 02:23:44,023
Make it 40.

1929
02:23:44,158 --> 02:23:45,724
Thank you.

1930
02:25:19,183 --> 02:25:21,110
Didn't you feel triumphant?

1931
02:25:24,620 --> 02:25:28,289
Now we can really understand
what the meaning of music is.

1932
02:25:28,424 --> 02:25:32,556
It's the way it makes you feel
when you hear it.

1933
02:25:32,691 --> 02:25:35,659
Finally, we've taken
that last giant step.

1934
02:25:35,794 --> 02:25:38,168
And we're there.
We know what music means now.

1935
02:25:38,304 --> 02:25:41,004
And we don't have to know
a lot of stuff about sharps

1936
02:25:41,139 --> 02:25:43,470
and flats and chords
and all that business

1937
02:25:43,606 --> 02:25:48,411
in order to understand music
if it tells us something.

1938
02:25:48,546 --> 02:25:51,984
And the most wonderful thing of
all is that there's no limit to

1939
02:25:52,119 --> 02:25:56,219
the different kinds of feelings
music can make you have.

1940
02:25:56,354 --> 02:26:00,155
And some of those feelings
are so special and so deep

1941
02:26:00,290 --> 02:26:02,659
that they can't even be
described in words.

1942
02:26:02,795 --> 02:26:03,992
You see, we can't always name

1943
02:26:04,128 --> 02:26:05,396
the things we feel.

1944
02:26:05,531 --> 02:26:06,496
Sometimes we can.

1945
02:26:06,632 --> 02:26:07,998
We can say we feel joy,

1946
02:26:08,133 --> 02:26:11,832
pleasure, peacefulness,
whatever, love, hate.

1947
02:26:11,968 --> 02:26:14,070
But every once in a while,

1948
02:26:14,206 --> 02:26:16,905
we have feelings that are
so deep and so special

1949
02:26:17,040 --> 02:26:18,666
that we have no words for them.

1950
02:26:18,802 --> 02:26:21,678
And that's where music
is so marvelous,

1951
02:26:21,813 --> 02:26:23,946
because music names them for us,

1952
02:26:24,082 --> 02:26:26,881
only in notes
instead of in words.

1953
02:26:27,016 --> 02:26:28,414
It's all in the way music moves.

1954
02:26:28,549 --> 02:26:31,186
You must never forget
that music is movement,

1955
02:26:31,321 --> 02:26:34,023
always going somewhere,
shifting and changing

1956
02:26:34,159 --> 02:26:37,863
and flowing
from one note to another.

1957
02:26:37,998 --> 02:26:39,360
And that movement can tell us

1958
02:26:39,495 --> 02:26:42,624
more about the way we feel
than a million words can.

1959
02:26:42,760 --> 02:26:44,361
And here we're going
to play you a...

1960
02:26:58,846 --> 02:27:00,545
Tony.

1961
02:27:01,849 --> 02:27:03,387
Oh.

1962
02:27:03,522 --> 02:27:04,651
Hi, Linda.

1963
02:27:04,786 --> 02:27:06,081
Sorry.

1964
02:27:06,216 --> 02:27:08,284
Lydia.

1965
02:27:08,419 --> 02:27:10,659
Ma said you'd be over.

1966
02:27:10,795 --> 02:27:13,129
You must be hiding out.

1967
02:27:13,898 --> 02:27:16,424
Why would I be hiding out?

1968
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:18,636
Beats the hell out of me.

1969
02:27:18,771 --> 02:27:21,038
None of my business anyhow.

1970
02:27:22,107 --> 02:27:24,602
Lot of loose ends,
you got to admit.

1971
02:27:26,370 --> 02:27:27,737
What do you mean?

1972
02:27:27,872 --> 02:27:30,082
Well, like I said,
it ain't my business.

1973
02:27:31,252 --> 02:27:33,408
But you don't seem to know
where the hell you came from

1974
02:27:33,543 --> 02:27:35,217
or where you're going.

1975
02:28:27,530 --> 02:28:29,271
May I come inside?

1976
02:28:30,543 --> 02:28:32,175
Thank you.

1977
02:28:44,118 --> 02:28:45,653
Um, I'm so sorry.

1978
02:28:45,789 --> 02:28:48,323
Uh, we just wanted to confirm
that the composer was in fact

1979
02:28:48,458 --> 02:28:50,393
not flying in from Osaka
to attend the concert.

1980
02:28:50,529 --> 02:28:51,988
Oh.

1981
02:28:52,124 --> 02:28:55,166
I-I must tell you that I-I
looked in the music libraries,

1982
02:28:55,301 --> 02:28:58,902
uh, for her score,
but I-I couldn't find anything.

1983
02:28:59,037 --> 02:29:01,165
- This just arrived.
- Ah.

1984
02:29:01,301 --> 02:29:03,503
That's great. Thank you.

1985
02:29:04,706 --> 02:29:07,178
Shirley and Cirio will be
most happy to show you

1986
02:29:07,313 --> 02:29:09,437
- the sights of our beautiful country.
- Oh. Thank you.

1987
02:29:09,572 --> 02:29:11,240
Thank you so much.

1988
02:29:11,376 --> 02:29:13,385
Oh, goodness.

1989
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:15,218
Thank-thank you.

1990
02:29:46,352 --> 02:29:50,445
Maybe we could stop somewhere
and take a swim.

1991
02:29:50,581 --> 02:29:52,052
Yeah, at the waterfall.

1992
02:29:52,188 --> 02:29:54,158
But, mm, not in the river.

1993
02:29:54,293 --> 02:29:56,728
Why? Is there something wrong
with the water?

1994
02:29:56,863 --> 02:29:59,462
N-No. There are crocodiles.

1995
02:29:59,598 --> 02:30:01,429
Oh.

1996
02:30:01,564 --> 02:30:04,068
I didn't think
they'd be this far inland.

1997
02:30:04,204 --> 02:30:07,129
They escaped from
Marlon Brando movie.

1998
02:30:07,265 --> 02:30:08,739
Wow.

1999
02:30:08,875 --> 02:30:11,641
That was a long time ago.

2000
02:30:11,777 --> 02:30:13,573
They survive.

2001
02:30:47,808 --> 02:30:50,280
Lady. Lady.- -

2002
02:30:52,280 --> 02:30:53,676
Here is prescription.

2003
02:30:53,811 --> 02:30:55,443
- Ten dollars.
- Oh. Thank you.

2004
02:30:56,851 --> 02:31:00,957
Uh, is there somewhere
around here... thank you...

2005
02:31:01,092 --> 02:31:03,019
Where I could get a massage?

2006
02:31:03,154 --> 02:31:05,627
Was hoping it might help me
with this jet lag.

2007
02:31:07,765 --> 02:31:09,631
Hmm.

2008
02:31:09,767 --> 02:31:10,893
Yes.

2009
02:31:11,028 --> 02:31:13,703
There is
the very nice place I know.

2010
02:31:13,838 --> 02:31:15,468
Thank you.

2011
02:31:28,655 --> 02:31:29,855
Thank you.

2012
02:31:29,990 --> 02:31:31,755
Please step over
to the fishbowl.

2013
02:31:31,891 --> 02:31:33,657
The... the fishbowl?

2014
02:31:33,792 --> 02:31:35,457
Yes, over there.

2015
02:31:40,967 --> 02:31:42,198
Um, I'm sorry, I'm confused.

2016
02:31:42,334 --> 02:31:44,532
H-How does this...
how does it work?

2017
02:31:45,334 --> 02:31:47,568
You just pick a number here.

2018
02:31:48,972 --> 02:31:50,903
I pick a number?

2019
02:31:51,039 --> 02:31:52,610
Yes.

2020
02:32:03,551 --> 02:32:05,817
Number five?

2021
02:32:49,198 --> 02:32:50,892
Good morning.

2022
02:32:51,027 --> 02:32:52,403
Good morning.

2023
02:32:52,539 --> 02:32:55,063
Now, before we begin,
let's-let's talk a bit about

2024
02:32:55,199 --> 02:32:58,705
the composer's intent
with this piece.

2025
02:33:00,046 --> 02:33:01,943
And what she might be after.

2026
02:33:21,058 --> 02:33:22,894
Five minutes.

2027
02:33:54,432 --> 02:33:56,433
Thank you.

2028
02:34:20,222 --> 02:34:24,226
Sisters and brothers
of the Fifth Fleet, it's time.

2029
02:34:24,361 --> 02:34:26,821
I'll keep my farewell brief.

2030
02:34:26,957 --> 02:34:29,423
Never was much with words.

2031
02:34:29,559 --> 02:34:33,562
Once you board this ship,
there's no turning back.

2032
02:34:33,697 --> 02:34:37,841
The next ground your feet touch
will be that of the New World.

2033
02:34:40,479 --> 02:34:42,336
If any of you
have lost your nerve,

2034
02:34:42,472 --> 02:34:46,707
then step away now
and let no one judge you.
