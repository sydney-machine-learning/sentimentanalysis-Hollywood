1
00:03:03,994 --> 00:03:06,872
<i>Today, we're
looking at some of the hottest weather...</i>

2
00:05:02,146 --> 00:05:03,314
Hey.

3
00:05:07,784 --> 00:05:09,019
What is it?

4
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:12,322
What?

5
00:05:12,423 --> 00:05:14,225
We've been ordered
to stand down.

6
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:16,026
They're scrapping the program.

7
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:18,929
They say we fell short.

8
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:21,165
The contract threshold
is mach 10.

9
00:05:21,298 --> 00:05:23,601
Mach 10 is supposed to be
in two months.

10
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:25,536
Today's test point is mach 9.

11
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:27,471
Well, that's not good enough.

12
00:05:27,605 --> 00:05:28,838
Says who?

13
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:30,840
Admiral Cain.

14
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:33,143
The drone ranger.

15
00:05:33,277 --> 00:05:35,613
He wants our budget for
his unmanned program.

16
00:05:35,744 --> 00:05:39,781
He's on his way to kill the test
and shut us down personally.

17
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:55,031
Well, he isn't here yet.

18
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:00,403
They want mach 10,

19
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:02,438
let's give 'em mach 10.

20
00:06:20,223 --> 00:06:23,092
Now remember, the
contract threshold is mach 10.

21
00:06:23,226 --> 00:06:26,763
Not 10.1. Not 10.2.
Mach 10.

22
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:29,132
That should keep
the program alive.

23
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,503
I don't like that look, mav.

24
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:37,140
It's the only one I got.

25
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:48,284
<i>Control, this is</i>
dark star. <i>How do you read?</i>

26
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:50,653
<i>Dark star,</i> control.
Loud and clear. How me?

27
00:06:50,787 --> 00:06:54,123
Loud and clear. Takeoff precheck's
complete. Ready for apu start.

28
00:06:54,257 --> 00:06:57,226
<i>Ready left engine start.</i>

29
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:00,396
<i>Ready right engine start.</i>

30
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:02,565
Thumbs for taxi.

31
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:06,703
We are ready for taxi.

32
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,407
Tower, this is <i>dark star.</i> We
are taxiing with information Alpha.

33
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,662
Dark star, <i>you are clear to taxi.</i>

34
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:16,412
<i>Runway 21. Winds 210, 10.</i>

35
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:18,881
- Fuel temps are looking good.
<i>- Control concurs.</i>

36
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:21,685
<i>Battery's holding at
95%. Cabin pressure looks good.</i>

37
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:24,780
<i>Control concurs. Tower,

38
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:27,725
<i>Requesting an unrestricted
climb to 600 and above.</i>

39
00:07:27,857 --> 00:07:30,338
Dark star,
<i>the runway and skies are yours.</i>

40
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:32,895
Rear admiral Chester Cain.

41
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,033
Maverick,
Cain just pulled up to the gate.

42
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,335
It's not too late to stop,
buddy.

43
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,439
<i>You know what happens to you
if you go through with this.</i>

44
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:46,610
I know what happens
to everyone else if I don't.

45
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:51,013
Dark star <i>is ready for takeoff.</i>

46
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:54,984
Everyone,

47
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:57,620
go for takeoff,
starting with engine.

48
00:07:57,754 --> 00:07:59,522
Engine, go.
Thermals, go.

49
00:07:59,655 --> 00:08:01,591
Fuel, go.
Electric, go.

50
00:08:01,724 --> 00:08:03,292
Control surfaces, go.

51
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:05,828
Dark star, <i>control.</i>
<i>You're cleared for takeoff.</i>

52
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:07,630
All right, sweetheart,

53
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:09,399
one last ride.

54
00:08:34,858 --> 00:08:38,996
Dark star, <i>you are cleared
above 600. Increase to mach 3.5.</i>

55
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:43,232
Cleared above 600.
Increase to mach 3.5.

56
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:50,540
Admiral.

57
00:08:50,673 --> 00:08:53,709
Uh, just in time, sir.
I'm early. So are you.

58
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:55,144
You care to explain?

59
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:57,480
Transitioning to scramjet.

60
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:13,029
Uh, mav,
admiral Cain is asking...

61
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:15,465
Ordering. Ordering
that we bring her down.

62
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,958
<i>Op... oop... Alpha...</i>

63
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:19,268
<i>three, oh...</i>

64
00:09:19,402 --> 00:09:22,672

65
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:24,507
<i>within six...</i>

66
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,521
This is where we've had
trouble with comms, sir.

67
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:28,946
It's the earth's curvature.
It's called "earth bulge."

68
00:09:29,078 --> 00:09:30,580
Did anyone offer you a coffee?

69
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:33,348
Okay.

70
00:09:40,991 --> 00:09:42,826
He's at mach 7, pushing 8.

71
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:45,362
Flight data?
Receiving. Data is good.

72
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:53,804
Temperature's climbing. Response
is still stable. We're feeling good.

73
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:59,109
<i>Mach 8.8.</i>

74
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:01,111
8.9.

75
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:02,746
Mach 9.

76
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,681
He's the fastest man alive.

77
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:25,601
Talk to me, goose.

78
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,704
Mach 9.1.

79
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:30,706
9.2.

80
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:39,315
Mach 9.3.

81
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:43,252
9.4.

82
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,622
Approaching high hypersonic.

83
00:10:58,902 --> 00:11:00,571
Windshield hot caution.

84
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:11,380
Surface temp rising.

85
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:18,654
Come on, sweetheart,
just a little more.

86
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:21,324
Just a little.

87
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,261
Come on!

88
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:32,767
Come on!

89
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,610
Mach 10!

90
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:43,679
Put that
in your Pentagon budget!

91
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:46,782
Sir.

92
00:11:57,627 --> 00:11:59,528
Oh,
don't do it. Don't do it.

93
00:11:59,662 --> 00:12:00,696
Just...

94
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,768
A little push.

95
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:10,574
Holy shit.

96
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:22,986
You got some
balls, stick jockey.

97
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,387
I'll give you that.

98
00:12:28,858 --> 00:12:30,226
Oh, shit.

99
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:36,465
Maverick.

100
00:12:38,267 --> 00:12:39,735
Maverick!

101
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:31,221
Thank you.

102
00:13:31,855 --> 00:13:33,557
Where am I?

103
00:13:34,357 --> 00:13:35,759
Earth.

104
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,407
<i>Maverick.</i>

105
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,243
Thirty-plus years of service.

106
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:56,612
Combat medals.

107
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:58,215
Citations.

108
00:13:58,347 --> 00:14:03,285
Only man to shoot down three
enemy planes in the last 40 years.

109
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:05,055
"Distinguished."

110
00:14:05,188 --> 00:14:08,791
"Distinguished."
"distinguished."

111
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:13,629
Yet you can't get a promotion,
you won't retire,

112
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:16,732
and despite your best efforts,
you refuse to die.

113
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:22,005
You should be at least a two-star
admiral by now, if not a senator.

114
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:23,873
Yet here you are:

115
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,676
Captain.

116
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:28,879
Why is that?

117
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:31,048
It's one of
life's mysteries, sir.

118
00:14:31,182 --> 00:14:34,684
This isn't a joke.
I asked you a question.

119
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:38,687
I'm where I belong, sir.

120
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:41,925
Well, the Navy
doesn't see it that way.

121
00:14:42,926 --> 00:14:44,027
Not anymore.

122
00:14:45,394 --> 00:14:47,396
These planes
you've been testing,

123
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:49,266
captain,

124
00:14:49,398 --> 00:14:52,835
one day, sooner than later,
they won't need pilots at all.

125
00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:56,739
Pilots that need to sleep,
eat, take a piss.

126
00:14:58,674 --> 00:15:01,044
Pilots that disobey orders.

127
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:05,548
All you did was buy some
time for those men out there.

128
00:15:07,383 --> 00:15:08,818
The future is coming,

129
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,720
and you're not in it.

130
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:15,724
Escort this man off the base.

131
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:18,394
Take him to his quarters.

132
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,330
Wait with him
while he packs his gear.

133
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,702
I want him on the road to
north island within the hour.

134
00:15:30,006 --> 00:15:31,540
North island, sir?

135
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:34,376
Call came in
with impeccable timing,

136
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:39,317
right as I was driving here to
ground your ass once and for all.

137
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:42,686
It galls me to say it, but...

138
00:15:43,955 --> 00:15:47,824
For reasons known only to the
almighty and your guardian angel...

139
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:52,362
You've been called back
to top gun.

140
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:59,836
Sir? You are dismissed, captain.

141
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:07,476
The end is inevitable, Maverick.

142
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,845
Your kind is headed
for extinction.

143
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:15,085
Maybe so, sir.

144
00:16:16,585 --> 00:16:18,387
But not today.

145
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:26,488
<i>Captain Pete
"Maverick" Mitchell.</i>

146
00:17:26,622 --> 00:17:28,757
Your reputation precedes you.

147
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,027
Thank you, sir.

148
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:33,862
Wasn't a compliment.

149
00:17:35,198 --> 00:17:37,533
I'm admiral Beau Simpson.
I'm the air boss.

150
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,136
I believe you know
admiral bates. Warlock, sir.

151
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:43,006
Must admit, I wasn't
expecting an invitation back.

152
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:45,208
They're called orders, Maverick.

153
00:17:46,475 --> 00:17:47,810
You two have
something in common.

154
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:50,713
Cyclone here was first
in his class back in '88.

155
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:52,983
Actually, sir,
I finished second.

156
00:17:53,116 --> 00:17:55,784
Just want to manage
expectations.

157
00:17:59,723 --> 00:18:01,158
The target...

158
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:05,729
Is an unsanctioned
uranium enrichment plant

159
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:08,165
built in violation
of a multilateral NATO treaty.

160
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:11,402
The uranium produced there
represents a direct threat

161
00:18:11,534 --> 00:18:12,702
to our allies in the region.

162
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:14,305
The Pentagon has tasked us

163
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:16,974
with assembling a strike
team and taking it out

164
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:19,576
before it becomes
fully operational.

165
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:23,713
The plant sits in an underground
bunker at the end of this valley.

166
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:25,349
Said valley is GPS-jammed

167
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:28,219
and defended by an extensive
surface-to-air missile array

168
00:18:28,352 --> 00:18:31,054
serving a limited number
of fifth-generation fighters,

169
00:18:31,187 --> 00:18:35,291
which in turn are backed up by a
plentiful reserve of surplus aircraft.

170
00:18:35,425 --> 00:18:37,427
Even a few old f-14s.

171
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,196
Seems like we're not the only
ones holding on to old relics.

172
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,100
What's your read, captain?

173
00:18:45,402 --> 00:18:49,305
Well, sir, normally this would be
a cakewalk for the f-35's stealth,

174
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:51,740
but the GPS-jamming
negates that.

175
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:55,811
And a surface-to-air threat necessitates
a low-level laser-guided strike

176
00:18:55,945 --> 00:18:57,414
tailor-made for the f-18.

177
00:18:57,546 --> 00:18:58,982
I figure,

178
00:18:59,115 --> 00:19:01,017
two precision bombs, minimum.

179
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:04,054
Makes it four aircraft
flying in pairs.

180
00:19:04,187 --> 00:19:06,256
That is one hell of a
steep climb out of there,

181
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:09,058
exposing you to all
the surface-to-air missiles.

182
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,061
You survive that,

183
00:19:12,028 --> 00:19:13,463
it's a dogfight
all the way home.

184
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:16,899
All requirements for which
you have real-world experience.

185
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:19,601
Not in the same mission, sir.

186
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:23,206
No.

187
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:28,344
No, someone's
not coming back from this.

188
00:19:28,478 --> 00:19:29,778
Can it be done or not?

189
00:19:29,913 --> 00:19:32,382
How soon before the plant
becomes operational?

190
00:19:32,515 --> 00:19:34,384
Three weeks. Maybe less.

191
00:19:35,552 --> 00:19:38,321
Well, it's been a while
since I've flown an f-18, and...

192
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:41,657
I'm not sure who I'd trust
to fly the other three.

193
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,859
But I'll find a way
to make it work.

194
00:19:43,993 --> 00:19:45,929
I think you misunderstand,
captain.

195
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:47,362
Sir?

196
00:19:47,464 --> 00:19:49,299
We don't want you to fly it.

197
00:19:49,432 --> 00:19:50,833
We want you to teach it.

198
00:19:53,536 --> 00:19:54,971
Teach, sir?

199
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:59,741
We've recalled 12 top gun
graduates from their squadrons.

200
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,278
We want you to narrow
that pool down to six.

201
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:05,081
They'll fly the mission.

202
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:08,184
Is there a problem, captain?

203
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:12,355
You know there is, sir.

204
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,591
Yeah.

205
00:20:14,723 --> 00:20:17,160
Bradley bradshaw,
aka "rooster."

206
00:20:17,293 --> 00:20:19,362
I understand you used to fly
with his old man.

207
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:21,365
What was his call sign?

208
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:23,567
"Goose," sir.

209
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,002
Tragic what happened.

210
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:26,977
Captain Mitchell was
cleared of any wrongdoing.

211
00:20:27,037 --> 00:20:28,838
Goose's death was an accident.

212
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:30,614
Is that how you see it, captain?

213
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,043
Is that how goose's son sees it?

214
00:20:35,845 --> 00:20:38,748
With all due respect, sir,
I'm not a teacher.

215
00:20:38,882 --> 00:20:40,351
You were a top gun
instructor before.

216
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:42,953
That was almost 30 years ago.
I lasted two months.

217
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:44,421
It's not where I belong.

218
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:46,423
Then let me be perfectly blunt.

219
00:20:46,557 --> 00:20:50,727
You were not my first choice. In
fact, you weren't even on the list.

220
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,863
You are here at the request
of admiral kazansky.

221
00:20:53,998 --> 00:20:57,467
Now, iceman happens to be
a man I deeply admire,

222
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,037
and he seems to think that you
have something left to offer the Navy.

223
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:03,772
What that is, I can't imagine.

224
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:07,143
You don't have to take this job.

225
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:08,277
But let me be clear:

226
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:11,514
This will be your last post,
captain.

227
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:16,885
You fly for top gun, or you
don't fly for the Navy ever again.

228
00:21:25,093 --> 00:21:27,196
Twenty bucks
you can't get three in a row.

229
00:22:08,304 --> 00:22:10,607
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

230
00:22:13,343 --> 00:22:14,444
Pete.

231
00:22:15,712 --> 00:22:16,745
Penny?

232
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,082
What are you doing here?

233
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:21,351
I should ask you the same thing.

234
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:24,621
Well, that is a long story.
I doubt that.

235
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:25,754
Yeah.

236
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,457
Who'd you piss off this time?

237
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,058
Another admiral.

238
00:22:29,192 --> 00:22:30,226
Exactly.

239
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:35,465
Are you mad at me?
Oh, Pete.

240
00:22:35,598 --> 00:22:39,135
I can never stay mad at you.
That's the problem.

241
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:40,269
Huh.

242
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,940
I got to say, north island
is the one place

243
00:22:43,073 --> 00:22:44,874
I thought for sure
I'd never run into you.

244
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:46,910
Mmm.
How long you been here?

245
00:22:47,044 --> 00:22:48,811
Bought this place
about three years ago.

246
00:22:48,946 --> 00:22:51,015
Three years?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

247
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:55,519
Not long after you got shipped off to the
desert for pissing off that other admiral.

248
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,555
That was three years ago?

249
00:22:59,423 --> 00:23:01,692
You must be in a lot of trouble.

250
00:23:01,824 --> 00:23:04,528
No way you'd come
back here willingly.

251
00:23:06,363 --> 00:23:07,364
Well,

252
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,933
you'll sort it out.

253
00:23:10,434 --> 00:23:11,834
No, I think, uh...

254
00:23:12,902 --> 00:23:15,239
I think this is it.
Come on, Pete.

255
00:23:15,372 --> 00:23:17,908
You've been saying that
as long as I've known you.

256
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:21,679
You said it after they busted you
for taking me on a joyride in that f-18.

257
00:23:21,811 --> 00:23:24,880
Then the next thing I know,
you're off to Bosnia.

258
00:23:25,014 --> 00:23:28,051
Then Iraq. Both times.

259
00:23:28,184 --> 00:23:29,885
You get yourself in trouble,

260
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:33,822
iceman makes a call,
and you're back in the air.

261
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:35,525
Penny, this is different.

262
00:23:35,658 --> 00:23:36,993
Pete, trust me,

263
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:39,261
as improbable
as it seems right now,

264
00:23:39,394 --> 00:23:43,098
somehow you'll be back in a
fighter plane with your tail on fire.

265
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:45,734
Penny...
Too late.

266
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:47,069
What?

267
00:23:47,202 --> 00:23:49,371
You were about to ask me
what time I get off.

268
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,544
Don't give me that look.

269
00:23:55,478 --> 00:23:58,681
I'm not giving you any look.
I swear.

270
00:23:58,815 --> 00:24:01,451
It always ends
the same with us, Pete.

271
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:04,921
Let's not start this time.

272
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:10,225
Okay.

273
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,295
Okay.

274
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:18,201
You look good.

275
00:24:28,111 --> 00:24:30,012
Much appreciated, pal.

276
00:24:32,582 --> 00:24:33,882
What am I missing?

277
00:24:35,785 --> 00:24:39,856
"Disrespect a lady, the Navy, or
put your cell phone on my bar..."

278
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:41,824
"And you buy a round."

279
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:43,493
For everyone?

280
00:24:43,626 --> 00:24:46,562
I'm afraid rules are rules.
You're lucky it's early.

281
00:24:47,697 --> 00:24:49,532
Oh, come on!

282
00:24:49,665 --> 00:24:52,068
What do we have here?

283
00:24:53,603 --> 00:24:55,538
If it ain't Phoenix!

284
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:58,441
And here I thought
we were special, coyote.

285
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:02,678
Turns out the invite
went to anyone.

286
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:04,914
Fellas, this here's bag man.

287
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:06,784
Hangman.
Whatever.

288
00:25:06,917 --> 00:25:09,420
You're looking at the only
naval aviator on active duty

289
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:11,288
with a confirmed
air-to-air kill.

290
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:12,456
Stop.

291
00:25:12,589 --> 00:25:14,691
Mind you, the other guy
was in a museum piece

292
00:25:14,825 --> 00:25:16,093
from the Korean war.

293
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:18,962
Cold war. Different
wars, same century.

294
00:25:19,096 --> 00:25:20,096
Not this one.

295
00:25:20,164 --> 00:25:21,598
Who are your friends?

296
00:25:21,732 --> 00:25:23,667
Payback.
Fanboy.

297
00:25:23,801 --> 00:25:25,736
Hey, coyote.
Hey.

298
00:25:25,869 --> 00:25:27,538
Who's he?
Who's who?

299
00:25:30,507 --> 00:25:32,276
When did you get in?

300
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:34,311
Oh, I've been here
the whole time.

301
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:37,080
The man's a stealth pilot.
Literally.

302
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:39,650
Weapons systems officer,
actually.

303
00:25:39,783 --> 00:25:41,652
With no sense of humor.

304
00:25:43,754 --> 00:25:45,122
What do they call you?

305
00:25:45,656 --> 00:25:46,857
Bob.

306
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,425
No, your call sign.

307
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:50,193
Uh...

308
00:25:51,327 --> 00:25:52,528
Bob.

309
00:25:52,662 --> 00:25:54,362
Bob Floyd.

310
00:25:54,496 --> 00:25:57,466
You're my new backs eater?
From lemoore?

311
00:25:58,567 --> 00:26:00,435
Looks like it. Yeah.

312
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:04,506
Nine-ball, Bob.

313
00:26:05,874 --> 00:26:06,975
Rack 'em.

314
00:26:08,743 --> 00:26:09,878
Okay.

315
00:26:10,011 --> 00:26:12,414
- Penny, my dear.
- Yeah.

316
00:26:12,547 --> 00:26:15,116
I'll have four more
on the old-timer.

317
00:26:23,626 --> 00:26:26,262
<i>That's all right,
mama. Uh, what's up?</i>

318
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:33,102
Bradshaw!

319
00:26:33,971 --> 00:26:35,605
Is that you?

320
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:43,112
This is how I find out
you're stateside?

321
00:26:43,246 --> 00:26:45,381
Yeah, I just thought
I'd surprise you. Hmm.

322
00:26:48,017 --> 00:26:50,319
I guess I surprised you back.

323
00:26:51,554 --> 00:26:53,723
It's good to see you.
Good to see you too.

324
00:26:56,259 --> 00:26:57,995
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

325
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,129
Much appreciated, pops.

326
00:27:07,737 --> 00:27:10,373
How about ringing me up
before the evening rush?

327
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:25,588
Bradshaw.

328
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:27,423
As I live and breathe.

329
00:27:28,058 --> 00:27:29,058
Hangman.

330
00:27:29,126 --> 00:27:31,495
You look... good.

331
00:27:32,396 --> 00:27:34,431
Well, I am good, rooster.

332
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:37,601
I'm very good.

333
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:39,102
In fact,

334
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:41,005
I am too good to be true.

335
00:27:41,138 --> 00:27:42,506
So,

336
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:44,800
anybody know what this special
detachment is all about?

337
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:48,345
No, mission's a mission.
They don't confront me.

338
00:27:48,478 --> 00:27:51,181
What I want to know:
Who's gonna be team leader?

339
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:53,584
And which one of y'all

340
00:27:53,717 --> 00:27:56,720
has what it takes to follow me?

341
00:27:57,888 --> 00:28:01,258
Hangman, the only place you'll
lead anyone is an early grave.

342
00:28:01,758 --> 00:28:03,260
Whoo!

343
00:28:10,466 --> 00:28:14,403
Well, anyone who follows you
is just gonna run out of fuel.

344
00:28:14,537 --> 00:28:16,805
But that's just you,
ain't it, rooster?

345
00:28:18,106 --> 00:28:20,042
You're snug on that perch,

346
00:28:20,175 --> 00:28:23,178
waiting for just
the right moment...

347
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:26,848
That never comes.

348
00:28:29,851 --> 00:28:31,119
I love this song!

349
00:28:38,727 --> 00:28:40,663
Well, he hasn't changed.

350
00:28:41,464 --> 00:28:43,265
Nope. Sure hasn't.

351
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,239
Check it out.

352
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:52,042
More patches.

353
00:28:52,174 --> 00:28:55,112
That's Harvard,
Yale, Omaha. Shit, that's Fritz.

354
00:28:55,244 --> 00:28:57,346
What the hell
kind of mission is this?

355
00:28:58,481 --> 00:29:01,118
That's not the question
we should be asking.

356
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,486
Everyone here
is the best there is.

357
00:29:04,654 --> 00:29:06,856
Who the hell are they
gonna get to teach us?

358
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,727
It's been declined.

359
00:29:11,861 --> 00:29:13,362
You're kidding.

360
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:30,780
Hey, guys. Come on.

361
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:46,429
How about...

362
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,465
That won't cover it.

363
00:29:53,637 --> 00:29:57,340
Uh, I'll come by tomorrow
and bring you the cash.

364
00:29:57,474 --> 00:30:00,310
I'm afraid
rules are rules, Pete.

365
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:10,154
Overboard!
Overboard! Overboard!

366
00:30:10,287 --> 00:30:11,288
Really?

367
00:30:11,421 --> 00:30:12,589
Overboard!

368
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:15,792
Overboard! Overboard!

369
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:18,495
Overboard! Overboard!

370
00:30:18,628 --> 00:30:21,531
Overboard! Overboard!

371
00:30:21,665 --> 00:30:22,665
Overboard!

372
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:25,267
Great to see you, Pete!
Overboard!

373
00:30:25,401 --> 00:30:28,738
Overboard! Overboard!

374
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:29,973
Overboard!

375
00:30:31,774 --> 00:30:34,510
Thanks for the beers!
Come back anytime!

376
00:31:36,338 --> 00:31:39,142
<i>Altitude 8,000... 7,000...</i>

377
00:31:39,276 --> 00:31:41,877
<i>Goose, I can't reach
the ejection handle.</i>

378
00:31:42,012 --> 00:31:44,047
<i>Eject, eject, eject!</i>

379
00:31:49,953 --> 00:31:51,288
Goose! Oh, no!

380
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,490
God, he loved flying
with you, Maverick.

381
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:39,435
<i>Attention on deck!</i>

382
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:51,881
Morning.

383
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:54,284
Welcome to your special
training detachment.

384
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:55,584
Be seated.

385
00:32:55,718 --> 00:32:58,587
I'm admiral bates,
nawdc commander.

386
00:32:58,721 --> 00:33:00,756
You're all top gun graduates.

387
00:33:01,358 --> 00:33:02,524
The elite.

388
00:33:02,658 --> 00:33:05,195
The best of the best.

389
00:33:05,328 --> 00:33:07,897
That was yesterday.

390
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:11,967
The enemy's new fifth-generation
fighter has leveled the playing field.

391
00:33:12,101 --> 00:33:13,735
Details are few,
but you can be sure

392
00:33:13,868 --> 00:33:16,038
we no longer possess
the technological advantage.

393
00:33:16,171 --> 00:33:19,341
Success, now more than ever,

394
00:33:19,474 --> 00:33:22,710
comes down to the man or woman
in the box.

395
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:25,714
Half of you will make the cut.

396
00:33:25,848 --> 00:33:27,683
One of you will
be named mission leader.

397
00:33:27,816 --> 00:33:30,853
The other half
will remain in reserve.

398
00:33:31,955 --> 00:33:33,889
Your instructor
is a top gun graduate

399
00:33:34,024 --> 00:33:36,592
with real-world experience
in every mission aspect

400
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:38,594
you will be expected to master.

401
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:41,730
His exploits are legendary.

402
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:45,168
And he's considered
to be one of the finest pilots

403
00:33:45,302 --> 00:33:47,536
this program has ever produced.

404
00:33:48,637 --> 00:33:50,140
What he has to teach you

405
00:33:50,273 --> 00:33:53,910
may very well mean the
difference between life and death.

406
00:33:54,643 --> 00:33:57,113
I give you
captain Pete Mitchell.

407
00:33:57,247 --> 00:33:59,983
Call sign: "Maverick."

408
00:34:04,687 --> 00:34:05,922
Good morning.

409
00:34:14,197 --> 00:34:15,898
The f-18 natops.

410
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,637
It contains everything they want
you to know about your aircraft.

411
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,573
I'm assuming you know the book
inside and out.

412
00:34:24,707 --> 00:34:26,042
Damn right.
Damn straight.

413
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,543
You got it.

414
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:36,686
So does your enemy.

415
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,056
And we're off.

416
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:43,227
But what the enemy
doesn't know is your limits.

417
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,595
I intend to find them,

418
00:34:45,729 --> 00:34:47,597
test them,

419
00:34:48,065 --> 00:34:49,233
push beyond.

420
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:54,205
Today we'll start with
what you only think you know.

421
00:34:55,904 --> 00:34:57,673
You show me what you're made of.

422
00:35:02,845 --> 00:35:04,080
Rooster.

423
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:06,181
Bradley.

424
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:08,118
Lieutenant bradshaw!

425
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:11,754
Yes, sir.

426
00:35:12,521 --> 00:35:14,523
Let's not do it like this.

427
00:35:15,425 --> 00:35:17,093
You gonna wash me out?

428
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:19,929
That'll be up to you, not me.

429
00:35:22,132 --> 00:35:23,665
Am I dismissed?

430
00:35:40,882 --> 00:35:43,352
Good morning, aviators.
This is your captain speaking.

431
00:35:43,485 --> 00:35:45,820
Welcome to basic
fighter maneuvers.

432
00:35:47,023 --> 00:35:49,926
<i>As briefed, today's exercise
is dog fighting.</i>

433
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,995
<i>Guns only, no missiles.</i>

434
00:35:52,996 --> 00:35:55,798
We do not go below the hard deck
of 5,000 feet.

435
00:35:55,932 --> 00:35:58,801
<i>Working as a team, you have
to shoot me down, or else.</i>

436
00:35:58,935 --> 00:36:02,138
Or else what, sir?
Or else I shoot back.

437
00:36:02,272 --> 00:36:05,141
<i>If I shoot either one of
you down, you both lose.</i>

438
00:36:05,275 --> 00:36:08,445
This guy needs an ego check.
We'll see to that.

439
00:36:08,577 --> 00:36:11,247
What say we put some skin in the
game? What do you have in mind?

440
00:36:11,381 --> 00:36:14,417
Whoever gets shot down first
has to do 200 push-ups.

441
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:17,087
Guys. That's a lot of push-ups.

442
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,456
They don't call it an
exercise for nothing, sir.

443
00:36:19,588 --> 00:36:21,458
You got yourself a deal,
gentlemen.

444
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:24,060
Fight's on.
Let's turn and burn.

445
00:36:25,295 --> 00:36:28,031
Fanboy, you see him?
Nothing on radar up ahead.

446
00:36:28,164 --> 00:36:29,999
He must be somewhere behind us.

447
00:36:31,534 --> 00:36:32,368
<i>Yeah!</i>

448
00:36:32,502 --> 00:36:34,104
Damn it!
What the hell?

449
00:36:34,237 --> 00:36:35,237
Shit!

450
00:36:39,442 --> 00:36:40,709
<i>Easy, Maverick.</i>

451
00:36:40,843 --> 00:36:43,413
Let's try not to get fired
on the first day.

452
00:36:43,546 --> 00:36:46,615
Tally, tally, tally! Maverick's
coming in! Break left!

453
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:48,118
Breaking left.

454
00:36:49,885 --> 00:36:51,854
Payback, where's your wing man?

455
00:36:51,988 --> 00:36:54,090
Rooster, where are you?
I got your back.

456
00:36:54,224 --> 00:36:56,758
I'm coming. Hang in there.
Hang in there.

457
00:36:56,892 --> 00:36:58,395
Hurry up, man! Hurry up!

458
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:05,102
Payback, break right.
Breaking right.

459
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:08,705
Rooster just saved your life,
fellas. But it's gonna cost him.

460
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:10,806
Not this time, old man.

461
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:15,044
Don't let him
get to you, Maverick.

462
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:24,220
Rooster, you're too low! Pull
up! You're hitting the hard deck!

463
00:37:24,354 --> 00:37:27,190
<i>- Altitude.
- Altitude.</i> Oh, shit.

464
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,228
That's a kill.

465
00:37:35,831 --> 00:37:38,767
Down! 110.

466
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,005
That should be us
down there. 111!

467
00:37:42,138 --> 00:37:43,473
But it's not.
Down!

468
00:37:43,606 --> 00:37:46,910
And now you know a little
something about rooster.

469
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,145
Whoo!
Wow.

470
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:51,756
Hold that tarmac down
till we get back, brother, all right?

471
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,459
Get in there, boys.

472
00:37:55,717 --> 00:37:57,719
That's a kill.
Damn!

473
00:37:58,321 --> 00:37:59,688
Smoked.
Damn it.

474
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:02,858
It was all fun and games in
that selfie, wasn't it? Down!

475
00:38:02,992 --> 00:38:04,026
<i>Say, Phoenix.</i>

476
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:05,170
How's about we tell everybody

477
00:38:05,194 --> 00:38:06,929
"Bob" stands for something?

478
00:38:07,062 --> 00:38:09,308
<i>- Other than Robert, I mean.</i>
- Don't take the bait, Bob.

479
00:38:09,332 --> 00:38:11,501
Want to know why
we call him hangman?

480
00:38:11,634 --> 00:38:13,769
I got it. "Baby on board."

481
00:38:16,372 --> 00:38:17,974
Shit!

482
00:38:18,975 --> 00:38:20,643
Greetings, aviators.
Fight's on.

483
00:38:20,776 --> 00:38:23,745
<i>All right, Phoenix,
let's take this guy out!</i>

484
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:24,948
Watch your back, Phoenix.

485
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:27,217
Break right!
Breaking right.

486
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,520
Where's he going?

487
00:38:30,653 --> 00:38:32,021
That's why we call him hangman.

488
00:38:32,155 --> 00:38:33,889
He'll always
hang you out to dry.

489
00:38:34,657 --> 00:38:35,992
Leaving your wing man.

490
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:37,886
There's a strategy
I haven't seen in a while.

491
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:40,196
He called you a man, Phoenix.
You gonna take that?

492
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,797
So long as he doesn't
call you a man.

493
00:38:41,931 --> 00:38:43,832
Talk to me, Bob.
Where's Maverick?

494
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:45,901
Jesus, his nose
is already coming around!

495
00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:47,670
Get him off me, hangman!

496
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:51,307
For all you folks at
home, this is how you Bury a fossil.

497
00:38:51,441 --> 00:38:54,077
All right, hangman.
Time to teach you a lesson.

498
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,246
You're out, Phoenix.
Son of a bitch!

499
00:38:57,547 --> 00:38:58,780
That's it.

500
00:38:58,915 --> 00:39:00,396
Let's go, mav.
Let's see what you got.

501
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,883
Come get me.

502
00:39:03,353 --> 00:39:05,355
Evil be gone.
Hangman's coming.

503
00:39:06,289 --> 00:39:08,890
Yeah, you're good.
I'll give you that.

504
00:39:16,332 --> 00:39:18,201
Phoenix, I can't see him.
How close am I?

505
00:39:18,334 --> 00:39:20,770
Phoenix?
I'm dead, dickhead.

506
00:39:20,903 --> 00:39:22,740
See you in the afterlife,
bag man.

507
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:26,442
Where is he? Where
is he?

508
00:39:26,576 --> 00:39:27,744
That's a kill.

509
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:31,880
Seventy-nine. Down.
Eighty. Down.

510
00:39:32,015 --> 00:39:33,483
<i>Let's go. Who's next?</i>

511
00:39:34,651 --> 00:39:36,486
I got you, Omaha.
Damn it!

512
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:41,624
Lights out, coyote.
Copy kill.

513
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:46,362
Down. Fifty-one.
Down. Fifty-two.

514
00:39:48,998 --> 00:39:51,934
So, rooster, mind if I ask you
a personal question?

515
00:39:52,068 --> 00:39:53,269
Would it matter if I did?

516
00:39:53,403 --> 00:39:55,505
What's the story
with you and Maverick?

517
00:39:55,638 --> 00:39:58,807
It seems like he's got you rattled.
That's none of your business.

518
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:00,743
Now where the hell is he?

519
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:02,844
<i>Been here the whole time.</i>

520
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,581
Holy shit.

521
00:40:07,617 --> 00:40:08,785
You see me now?

522
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:11,554
Come on, let's get it over with.

523
00:40:12,021 --> 00:40:13,589
Fight's on!

524
00:40:15,124 --> 00:40:17,826
What is with these two?

525
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:25,535
All right, you put us here.
How you gonna get yourself out?

526
00:40:25,668 --> 00:40:28,071
You can bail out anytime.

527
00:40:28,204 --> 00:40:29,706
How low you want to go, rooster?

528
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:33,176
I can go as low as you, sir!
And that's saying something.

529
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:38,548
What's past is past.
For both of us.

530
00:40:38,681 --> 00:40:40,483
You'd like to believe that,
wouldn't you?

531
00:40:40,616 --> 00:40:44,554
Hard deck is 5,000 feet, fellas.
You are running out of room.

532
00:40:44,687 --> 00:40:47,728
<i>Altitude.</i> Your strategy
is about to run us into the ground.

533
00:40:47,824 --> 00:40:50,526
What's your move? <i>Altitude. Altitude.</i>

534
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,195
<i>Altitude.</i>

535
00:40:53,629 --> 00:40:56,632
<i>Altitude. Altitude. Altitude.</i>

536
00:40:56,766 --> 00:40:59,335
<i>Altitude. Altitude.</i>

537
00:41:01,137 --> 00:41:04,073
<i>Pull up! Pull up!
Pull up! Pull up!</i>

538
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,874
<i>Pull up! Pull up!</i>

539
00:41:08,845 --> 00:41:10,780
You got it.
Don't think, just do.

540
00:41:10,913 --> 00:41:14,417
Come on, rooster, you got him!
Drop down and take the shot!

541
00:41:15,884 --> 00:41:17,053
It's too low.

542
00:41:17,886 --> 00:41:19,655
Too late. You had your chance.

543
00:41:25,728 --> 00:41:28,564
That's a kill. Knock it off.

544
00:41:29,532 --> 00:41:30,566
Damn it!

545
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,635
Same old rooster.

546
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:37,540
Go see hon do
about your push-ups.

547
00:41:45,481 --> 00:41:47,016
All right, that's enough.

548
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,119
Rooster.
That's enough, man.

549
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,870
Breaking the hard deck, insubordination.
Are you trying to get kicked out?

550
00:42:08,004 --> 00:42:09,472
Don't worry about it.

551
00:42:09,605 --> 00:42:12,442
Look, I'm going on this mission.

552
00:42:13,609 --> 00:42:15,970
But if you get kicked out, you
leave us flying with hangman.

553
00:42:16,045 --> 00:42:20,516
Talk to me. What the hell
was that? He pulled my papers.

554
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:24,220
What? Who?
Maverick.

555
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:28,024
He pulled my application
to the naval academy.

556
00:42:28,858 --> 00:42:31,093
Set me back four years.

557
00:42:33,296 --> 00:42:35,064
Why would he do that?

558
00:42:40,436 --> 00:42:42,872
The hard deck is
5,000 feet above ground level.

559
00:42:43,005 --> 00:42:45,274
A parameter is set not just
for the safety of our pilots,

560
00:42:45,408 --> 00:42:47,076
but for the safety
of their aircraft.

561
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:51,314
5,000 feet is not just a rule. It is
a law, as immutable as gravity.

562
00:42:51,447 --> 00:42:54,117
The hard deck will be much
lower for the mission, sir.

563
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:57,287
And it will not change
without my approval!

564
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,288
Especially not
in the middle of an exercise.

565
00:42:59,422 --> 00:43:03,226
And that cobra maneuver of yours?
That could've got all three of you killed.

566
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,294
I never want to see
that shit again.

567
00:43:05,428 --> 00:43:08,564
What exactly do you suppose
you were teaching, captain?

568
00:43:08,698 --> 00:43:11,076
That as good as they are, sir,
they still have something to learn.

569
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,812
You are talking about the best
fighter pilots on the planet, captain.

570
00:43:13,836 --> 00:43:15,677
And they've been told that
their entire career,

571
00:43:15,705 --> 00:43:17,549
while they've been dropping
bombs from a high altitude

572
00:43:17,573 --> 00:43:19,609
with little to no dog fighting.

573
00:43:19,742 --> 00:43:22,254
The parameters of this mission call for
something they have never encountered.

574
00:43:22,278 --> 00:43:26,883
Okay, you have less than three weeks
to teach them how to fight as a team

575
00:43:27,016 --> 00:43:28,217
and how to strike the target.

576
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:30,386
And how to come home.

577
00:43:33,022 --> 00:43:35,258
And how to come home, sir.

578
00:43:40,596 --> 00:43:43,165
Every mission has its risks.

579
00:43:43,299 --> 00:43:45,034
These pilots accept that.

580
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:47,069
I don't, sir.

581
00:43:50,673 --> 00:43:52,341
Every morning,
from this day forward,

582
00:43:52,475 --> 00:43:54,844
you will brief us on your
instructional plans in writing.

583
00:43:54,978 --> 00:43:57,846
And nothing will change
without my express approval.

584
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,550
Including the hard deck, sir?
Especially the hard deck, captain.

585
00:44:03,585 --> 00:44:04,687
Sir.

586
00:44:05,588 --> 00:44:06,656
What is this?

587
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:08,591
It's a request to lower
the hard deck, sir,

588
00:44:08,724 --> 00:44:11,205
to practice a low-level bombing
run per the mission parameters.

589
00:44:16,832 --> 00:44:19,769
You could learn a thing or two
about timing, captain.

590
00:44:20,403 --> 00:44:21,604
<i>Yo, coyote.</i>

591
00:44:22,138 --> 00:44:23,606
Take a look at this.

592
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:30,013
The man, the legend.
There he is.

593
00:44:30,146 --> 00:44:32,381
No, no, no.
Next to him.

594
00:44:33,115 --> 00:44:35,384
He look familiar to you?

595
00:44:37,086 --> 00:44:38,821
What have we here?

596
00:44:39,422 --> 00:44:41,424
Bradshaw.

597
00:44:42,158 --> 00:44:44,126
As I live and breathe.

598
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:49,732
Hey, Theo, you got big.

599
00:44:50,366 --> 00:44:51,400
Hey, mav.

600
00:44:58,741 --> 00:44:59,741
Amelia?

601
00:44:59,842 --> 00:45:01,210
I know. I got big.

602
00:45:01,344 --> 00:45:02,778
Yes.

603
00:45:03,813 --> 00:45:04,982
Bar opens at 5:00.

604
00:45:05,114 --> 00:45:07,850
No, I just came by
to pay off a debt.

605
00:45:07,985 --> 00:45:09,418
Mom!

606
00:45:13,756 --> 00:45:16,860
Hey, how's your dad?
With his wife, in Hawaii.

607
00:45:16,995 --> 00:45:18,528
Mom!

608
00:45:19,262 --> 00:45:21,798
Mav says he owes you money.

609
00:45:21,933 --> 00:45:25,201
Oh. Don't worry
about it. I insist.

610
00:45:27,971 --> 00:45:31,908
Thank you, captain.
Consider your tab closed.

611
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:34,510
Captain? Still?

612
00:45:34,644 --> 00:45:37,513
A highly decorated captain.

613
00:45:37,647 --> 00:45:38,514
Finish up.

614
00:45:38,648 --> 00:45:40,316
We have to get the boat
to the yard.

615
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:42,351
I can't go. What do
you mean, you can't go?

616
00:45:42,485 --> 00:45:45,688
Test tomorrow. I have to
study. They only told us today.

617
00:45:45,821 --> 00:45:47,924
Well, I can't sail her alone.

618
00:45:48,058 --> 00:45:49,325
Just use the engine.

619
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:51,727
Why are we taking her
to the yard?

620
00:45:51,861 --> 00:45:53,462
To fix the engine.

621
00:45:53,596 --> 00:45:55,731
Mm-hmm.
I can help.

622
00:46:01,704 --> 00:46:04,807
Little rougher than I
was expecting. You don't say.

623
00:46:04,941 --> 00:46:08,744
Pull on the back stay.
We'll de-power the sails.

624
00:46:08,878 --> 00:46:10,179
Okay.

625
00:46:10,312 --> 00:46:12,213
What does that mean?

626
00:46:13,314 --> 00:46:15,450
You're supposed to be
in the Navy!

627
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:19,354
I don't sail boats, penny.
I land on them.

628
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:22,791
It's sort of like raising
the flaps on an airplane.

629
00:46:22,925 --> 00:46:24,492
So how do I do that?

630
00:46:24,626 --> 00:46:27,229
You pull on
that green line up there.

631
00:46:27,363 --> 00:46:28,831
Green line.

632
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:32,601
Yep. Pull it hard.

633
00:46:32,735 --> 00:46:35,805
Yep. Crank that winch
right there,

634
00:46:35,939 --> 00:46:37,807
tighten the jib.

635
00:46:38,441 --> 00:46:40,843
Crank it. You okay? Yeah.

636
00:46:42,244 --> 00:46:43,446
Good.

637
00:46:44,613 --> 00:46:45,648
Now,

638
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,317
you ready?

639
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:51,821
For what?

640
00:46:51,955 --> 00:46:53,622
The afterburner.

641
00:47:13,642 --> 00:47:15,745
Now you're in the Navy.

642
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:39,836
Thanks for helping out today.

643
00:47:41,371 --> 00:47:42,940
I'm not exactly sure I helped.

644
00:47:44,775 --> 00:47:45,943
Hmm.

645
00:47:48,278 --> 00:47:49,813
Don't give me that look.

646
00:47:49,947 --> 00:47:51,148
What look?

647
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,016
That one.

648
00:47:56,219 --> 00:47:57,686
Good night, Pete.

649
00:47:58,287 --> 00:47:59,789
Night, penny.

650
00:48:15,138 --> 00:48:17,107
Mom, is that you?

651
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,707
Yeah, it's me.

652
00:48:19,475 --> 00:48:21,178
I'll make you dinner.

653
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:22,545
Okay.

654
00:48:28,483 --> 00:48:30,885
Time is your greatest enemy.

655
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:34,256
Phase one of the mission
will be a low-level ingress

656
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:35,925
attacking in two-plane teams.

657
00:48:36,058 --> 00:48:38,760
You'll fly along this narrow
canyon to your target.

658
00:48:38,893 --> 00:48:42,363
Radar-guided surface-to-air
missiles defend the area.

659
00:48:42,497 --> 00:48:45,100
These sams, they're lethal.

660
00:48:45,234 --> 00:48:49,072
But they were designed to protect
the skies above, not the canyon below.

661
00:48:49,206 --> 00:48:53,176
That's because the enemy knows no one
is insane enough to try and fly below them.

662
00:48:54,177 --> 00:48:56,846
That's exactly what
I'm gonna train you to do.

663
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:01,350
On the day, your altitude
will be 100 feet maximum.

664
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:02,818
You exceed this altitude...

665
00:49:02,953 --> 00:49:05,354
Radar will spot you

666
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:07,857
and you're dead.

667
00:49:07,991 --> 00:49:10,392
Your airspeed will be 660 knots

668
00:49:11,027 --> 00:49:12,027
minimum.

669
00:49:12,095 --> 00:49:14,331
Time to target:
Two and a half minutes.

670
00:49:14,463 --> 00:49:19,435
That's because fifth-generation
fighters wait at an air base nearby.

671
00:49:19,568 --> 00:49:23,873
In a head-to-head with these
planes in your f-18s, you're dead.

672
00:49:25,075 --> 00:49:27,776
That's why you need to get in,
hit your target and be gone

673
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:30,981
before these planes even
have a chance of catching you.

674
00:49:31,114 --> 00:49:34,217
This makes time
your greatest adversary.

675
00:49:35,651 --> 00:49:39,688
<i>You'll fly a route in your nav
system that simulates the canyon.</i>

676
00:49:39,822 --> 00:49:41,690
<i>The faster you navigate
this canyon,</i>

677
00:49:41,824 --> 00:49:44,393
<i>the harder it'll be to stay under
the radar of these enemy sams.</i>

678
00:49:44,526 --> 00:49:46,495
<i>The tighter the turns,</i>

679
00:49:46,629 --> 00:49:48,331
<i>the more intensely
the force of gravity</i>

680
00:49:48,464 --> 00:49:50,399
<i>on your body multiplies...</i>

681
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:52,068
<i>Compressing your lungs...</i>

682
00:49:52,202 --> 00:49:54,637
<i>Forcing the blood from
your brain...</i>

683
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,907
<i>Impairing your judgment
and reaction time.</i>

684
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,475
So for today's lesson, we're
gonna take it easy on you.

685
00:49:59,608 --> 00:50:02,846
Max ceiling: 300 feet.
Time to target: Three minutes.

686
00:50:04,514 --> 00:50:05,917
Good luck.

687
00:50:14,025 --> 00:50:15,859
Time to target is one minute 30.

688
00:50:15,993 --> 00:50:18,395
We are two seconds behind.
Increase to 480 knots.

689
00:50:18,527 --> 00:50:19,963
We got to move, coyote.

690
00:50:20,663 --> 00:50:22,299
Copy. Increasing speed.

691
00:50:22,431 --> 00:50:23,699
Oh!

692
00:50:24,867 --> 00:50:25,867
Oh, shit!

693
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:30,206
Why are they dead?

694
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:33,310
We broke the 300-foot ceiling,
and a Sam took us out.

695
00:50:33,442 --> 00:50:35,078
No. Why are they dead?

696
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:37,422
I slowed down and didn't give
her a warning. It was my fault.

697
00:50:37,446 --> 00:50:40,527
Was there a reason you didn't communicate
with your team? I was focusing on...

698
00:50:40,649 --> 00:50:43,319
One that their family
will accept at the funeral.

699
00:50:43,451 --> 00:50:44,652
None, sir.

700
00:50:45,653 --> 00:50:47,014
Why didn't you
anticipate the turn?

701
00:50:47,056 --> 00:50:48,623
You were briefed on the terrain.

702
00:50:48,756 --> 00:50:51,961
Don't tell me.
Tell it to his family.

703
00:50:57,066 --> 00:50:59,634
Hangman, ease up.
The canyon's getting tighter.

704
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:02,438
Negative, payback.
Increase your speed.

705
00:51:03,738 --> 00:51:07,642
You're going too fast, man. No
harm in being ahead of schedule.

706
00:51:09,378 --> 00:51:12,282
Damn it, slow down!
I can't stay on the course!

707
00:51:12,415 --> 00:51:15,517
You're gonna hit the wall!
Watch out! Watch out!

708
00:51:18,854 --> 00:51:21,557
What happened?
I flew as fast as I could.

709
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:23,492
Kind of like my ass
depended on it.

710
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:27,230
And you put your team in danger,
and your wing man's dead.

711
00:51:28,365 --> 00:51:30,033
They couldn't keep up.

712
00:51:35,704 --> 00:51:38,540
<i>Rooster, we're 20
seconds behind and dropping.</i>

713
00:51:38,674 --> 00:51:41,277
We're fine. Speed is good.

714
00:51:41,411 --> 00:51:43,046
Increase to 500 knots.

715
00:51:43,179 --> 00:51:45,881
Negative, Yale. Hold your
speed. <i>Rooster, we're late!</i>

716
00:51:46,016 --> 00:51:48,784
We're alive. We'll make
up time in the straightaway.

717
00:51:48,918 --> 00:51:50,320
<i>We are not gonna make it.</i>

718
00:51:50,453 --> 00:51:53,589
Just trust me. Maintain
your speed. We can make it.

719
00:51:53,722 --> 00:51:55,824
Why are you dead?

720
00:51:55,959 --> 00:51:57,460
You're team leader up there.

721
00:51:57,593 --> 00:51:59,996
Why are you,
why is your team dead?

722
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:02,798
Sir, he's the only one
who made it to the target.

723
00:52:02,932 --> 00:52:04,934
A minute late.

724
00:52:05,068 --> 00:52:07,536
He gave enemy aircraft
time to shoot him down.

725
00:52:07,669 --> 00:52:09,439
He is dead.
You don't know that.

726
00:52:09,571 --> 00:52:13,143
You're not flying fast enough.
You don't have a second to waste.

727
00:52:13,276 --> 00:52:14,944
We made it to the target.

728
00:52:15,078 --> 00:52:18,048
And superior enemy aircraft
intercepted you on your way out.

729
00:52:18,181 --> 00:52:21,117
Then it's a dogfight. Against
fifth-generation fighters.

730
00:52:21,251 --> 00:52:23,853
Yeah. We'd still have
a chance. In an f-18.

731
00:52:23,988 --> 00:52:26,524
It's not the plane, sir,
it's the pilot.

732
00:52:26,656 --> 00:52:27,992
Exactly!

733
00:52:34,898 --> 00:52:37,535
There's more than one way
to fly this mission.

734
00:52:37,667 --> 00:52:39,303
You really don't get it.

735
00:52:40,438 --> 00:52:43,307
On this mission,
a man flies like Maverick here,

736
00:52:43,441 --> 00:52:45,341
or a man does not come back.

737
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:47,743
No offense intended.

738
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,914
Yet somehow you always manage.

739
00:52:52,115 --> 00:52:53,849
Look, I don't mean to criticize.

740
00:52:53,983 --> 00:52:55,818
You're conservative, that's all.
Lieutenant.

741
00:52:55,952 --> 00:53:00,855
We're going into combat, son, on
a level no living pilot's ever seen.

742
00:53:02,257 --> 00:53:03,591
Not even him.

743
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,262
That's no time to be
thinking about the past.

744
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,867
What's that supposed
to mean? Rooster.

745
00:53:13,001 --> 00:53:15,712
I can't be the only one that knows
that Maverick flew with his old man.

746
00:53:15,736 --> 00:53:18,373
That's enough. Or that Maverick
was flying when his old man...

747
00:53:18,507 --> 00:53:20,976
Lieutenant, that's enough!

748
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:23,145
That's enough.
You son of a bitch!

749
00:53:23,278 --> 00:53:24,679
Hey, come on!

750
00:53:24,812 --> 00:53:26,515
I'm cool,
I'm cool. Hey, hey.

751
00:53:26,647 --> 00:53:28,968
That's enough.
He's not cut out for this mission.

752
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:31,619
That's enough!
You know it.

753
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:35,325
You know I'm right.

754
00:53:41,663 --> 00:53:42,999
You're all dismissed.

755
00:54:47,231 --> 00:54:48,765
Maverick.

756
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,269
It's come back?

757
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:54,371
No one knows.

758
00:54:56,273 --> 00:54:58,808
There's nothing else
they can do.

759
00:54:58,943 --> 00:55:02,179
Even speaking is painful now.

760
00:55:07,817 --> 00:55:09,954
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

761
00:55:29,471 --> 00:55:30,505
Admiral.

762
00:55:41,917 --> 00:55:43,318
How's my wing man?

763
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:57,267
Please, don't worry about me.

764
00:55:58,001 --> 00:56:00,036
What can I do for you?

765
00:56:08,378 --> 00:56:09,479
All right.

766
00:56:12,115 --> 00:56:15,451
Well, rooster's still angry
with me about what I did.

767
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:19,855
I thought eventually
he would understand why.

768
00:56:21,823 --> 00:56:23,792
I hoped he'd forgive me.

769
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,770
The mission is less
than three weeks away.

770
00:56:33,902 --> 00:56:36,205
The kid's not ready.

771
00:56:44,247 --> 00:56:46,449
He doesn't want
what I have to give.

772
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:48,785
Ice, please,

773
00:56:48,918 --> 00:56:51,054
don't ask me to send
someone else to die.

774
00:56:51,187 --> 00:56:52,522
Please don't...

775
00:56:53,289 --> 00:56:55,091
Don't ask me to send him.

776
00:56:55,224 --> 00:56:56,926
Send me.

777
00:57:28,524 --> 00:57:30,293
I don't know how.

778
00:57:43,238 --> 00:57:45,273
I'm not a teacher, ice.

779
00:57:47,576 --> 00:57:49,478
I'm a fighter pilot.

780
00:57:51,913 --> 00:57:53,482
A naval aviator.

781
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:58,153
It's not what I am.

782
00:57:59,121 --> 00:58:01,022
It's who I am.

783
00:58:02,591 --> 00:58:04,426
How do I teach that?

784
00:58:05,893 --> 00:58:09,431
Even if I could teach it,
it's not what rooster wants.

785
00:58:09,564 --> 00:58:11,833
It's not what the Navy wants.

786
00:58:11,967 --> 00:58:14,469
That's why they canned me
the last time.

787
00:58:17,105 --> 00:58:20,309
The only reason I'm here is you.

788
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,452
If I send him on this mission,

789
00:58:30,753 --> 00:58:32,688
he might never come home.

790
00:58:36,259 --> 00:58:38,594
And if I don't send him,

791
00:58:38,728 --> 00:58:40,630
he'll never forgive me.

792
00:58:43,166 --> 00:58:45,968
Either way,
I could lose him forever.

793
00:58:56,112 --> 00:58:57,346
I know.

794
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:59,482
I know.

795
00:59:10,393 --> 00:59:14,330
The Navy needs Maverick.

796
00:59:16,132 --> 00:59:19,802
The kid needs Maverick.

797
00:59:20,636 --> 00:59:23,239
That's why I fought for you.

798
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:27,543
That's why you're still here.

799
00:59:35,552 --> 00:59:37,087
Thank you, ice,

800
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:39,456
for everything.

801
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,661
One last thing.

802
00:59:45,795 --> 00:59:47,965
Who's the better pilot?

803
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:49,565
You or me?

804
00:59:52,435 --> 00:59:55,037
This is a nice moment.
Let's not ruin it.

805
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:37,112
All right, all right.

806
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,175
Yeah!

807
01:01:58,861 --> 01:01:59,997
Sir.

808
01:02:00,129 --> 01:02:01,697
What is this?
This is dogfight football.

809
01:02:01,831 --> 01:02:04,367
Offense and defense
at the same time.

810
01:02:04,867 --> 01:02:06,103
Who's winning?

811
01:02:06,235 --> 01:02:08,771
I think they stopped
keeping score a while ago.

812
01:02:08,904 --> 01:02:11,874
This detachment still has some
training to complete, captain.

813
01:02:12,009 --> 01:02:14,310
Every available
minute matters. Yes, sir.

814
01:02:14,443 --> 01:02:16,545
So why are we out here
playing games?

815
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:18,814
You said to create a team, sir.

816
01:02:20,182 --> 01:02:21,417
There's your team.

817
01:04:00,951 --> 01:04:03,552
Should I go?
Before Amelia gets back?

818
01:04:03,686 --> 01:04:06,388
She'll be at her friend's
house tonight. Oh, good.

819
01:04:09,291 --> 01:04:11,260
You and Amelia, you seem...

820
01:04:13,628 --> 01:04:16,099
A lot closer
than when I last saw you.

821
01:04:16,233 --> 01:04:18,801
Yeah. Yeah, we are.
How do you manage?

822
01:04:20,903 --> 01:04:22,872
Well,

823
01:04:23,006 --> 01:04:26,542
you know, she always wanted more
freedom than I thought she was ready for.

824
01:04:26,675 --> 01:04:29,712
Hmm. Where'd she
get that from, I wonder?

825
01:04:33,183 --> 01:04:34,750
I guess I realized

826
01:04:35,484 --> 01:04:37,753
I also had to trust her.

827
01:04:39,022 --> 01:04:42,358
Let her make some of her
own mistakes sometimes.

828
01:04:44,194 --> 01:04:46,062
Not an easy choice.
Mmm.

829
01:04:50,033 --> 01:04:52,434
Is that what happened
with rooster?

830
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:58,773
I pulled his papers
from the naval academy.

831
01:05:01,576 --> 01:05:03,578
Took years off his career.

832
01:05:09,784 --> 01:05:10,819
Why?

833
01:05:13,321 --> 01:05:17,358
His mother never wanted him to
fly, not after what happened to goose.

834
01:05:19,761 --> 01:05:23,232
She made me promise
before she died, so...

835
01:05:23,364 --> 01:05:25,533
Does rooster know that?

836
01:05:28,737 --> 01:05:32,008
He will always resent me
for what I did.

837
01:05:33,776 --> 01:05:36,579
Why should he resent her too?

838
01:05:40,716 --> 01:05:43,053
Not an easy choice.
Hmm.

839
01:05:45,454 --> 01:05:48,091
I was trying to be
the father he lost.

840
01:05:51,127 --> 01:05:52,361
I just...

841
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:57,399
I wish I would've
done it better.

842
01:05:59,368 --> 01:06:02,471
But the truth is...

843
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:06,775
I didn't think he was ready.

844
01:06:10,213 --> 01:06:12,015
Is he ready now?

845
01:06:14,617 --> 01:06:16,920
Mom, I'm home!

846
01:06:18,288 --> 01:06:20,756
I thought you were staying
at Karen's tonight.

847
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:23,626
Karen's sick.
And I've got homework to do.

848
01:06:23,759 --> 01:06:26,029
I should go.
You should go.

849
01:06:26,162 --> 01:06:29,564
- Have you had dinner yet?
- Not yet. You wanna go out?

850
01:06:29,697 --> 01:06:32,567
No, it's okay.
I'll make you something.

851
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,535
I'll be down in a sec!

852
01:06:34,669 --> 01:06:36,872
Wait! Not that way.
What?

853
01:06:38,375 --> 01:06:40,476
Look, I have an example to set.

854
01:06:40,609 --> 01:06:43,113
I can't be bringing guys
home on a first date.

855
01:06:43,246 --> 01:06:44,747
This is not our first date.

856
01:06:45,648 --> 01:06:47,516
You know what I mean.

857
01:06:50,086 --> 01:06:51,121
Okay.

858
01:06:52,222 --> 01:06:54,024
Fine.

859
01:06:54,157 --> 01:06:56,458
But this is the last time
I go out your window.

860
01:06:56,592 --> 01:06:58,094
We'll see.

861
01:06:58,228 --> 01:07:00,230
No. No, I mean it.

862
01:07:00,363 --> 01:07:02,531
I'm never gonna leave you again.

863
01:07:04,301 --> 01:07:05,734
Oh, shut up.

864
01:07:05,868 --> 01:07:08,004
Go on, get out of here.

865
01:07:21,418 --> 01:07:23,619
Just don't
break her heart again.

866
01:07:34,964 --> 01:07:36,231
<i>Good morning.</i>

867
01:07:36,365 --> 01:07:38,466
The uranium enrichment plant
that is your target

868
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:40,902
will be operational
earlier than expected.

869
01:07:41,036 --> 01:07:44,839
Raw uranium will be delivered
to the plant in ten days' time.

870
01:07:44,974 --> 01:07:47,910
As a result, your mission
has been moved up one week

871
01:07:48,044 --> 01:07:51,480
in order to avoid contaminating
the target valley with radiation.

872
01:07:51,613 --> 01:07:54,616
Sir, no one here has successfully
flown a low-level course.

873
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:56,920
Nevertheless, you've
been ordered to move on.

874
01:07:58,054 --> 01:07:59,089
Captain.

875
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:04,127
We have one week left
to focus on phase two.

876
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,129
It's the most difficult stage
of the mission.

877
01:08:06,262 --> 01:08:07,998
It's a pop-up strike
with a steep dive,

878
01:08:08,131 --> 01:08:11,500
requiring nothing less
than two consecutive miracles.

879
01:08:12,469 --> 01:08:13,702
<i>Two pairs of f-18s will fly</i>

880
01:08:13,836 --> 01:08:15,305
<i>in a welded wing formation.</i>

881
01:08:15,438 --> 01:08:19,209
<i>Teamwork. Precise coordination
of these aircraft is essential</i>

882
01:08:19,342 --> 01:08:22,045
<i>to both the mission's success
and your survival.</i>

883
01:08:22,178 --> 01:08:24,880
As you know, the plant rests
between two mountains.

884
01:08:25,015 --> 01:08:29,953
On final approach, you'll
invert directly into a steep dive.

885
01:08:30,086 --> 01:08:33,056
<i>This allows you to maintain
the lowest possible altitude</i>

886
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:36,059
<i>and the only possible
attack angle.</i>

887
01:08:39,429 --> 01:08:44,366
Your target is an impact point
less than three meters wide.

888
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,502
<i>The two-seat aircraft
will paint the target</i>

889
01:08:46,634 --> 01:08:48,870
<i>with a laser bull's-eye.</i>

890
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:50,838
The first pair
will breach the reactor

891
01:08:50,973 --> 01:08:54,642
by dropping a laser-guided bomb
on an exposed ventilation hatch.

892
01:08:54,776 --> 01:08:57,678
This will create an opening
for the second pair.

893
01:08:57,812 --> 01:08:59,615
That's miracle number one.

894
01:09:01,418 --> 01:09:04,454
<i>The second team
will deliver the kill shot...</i>

895
01:09:05,788 --> 01:09:07,856
And destroy the target.

896
01:09:08,824 --> 01:09:10,326
That's miracle number two.

897
01:09:11,627 --> 01:09:14,030
<i>If either team
misses the target...</i>

898
01:09:16,032 --> 01:09:18,401
That's a miss.
<i>The mission is a failure.</i>

899
01:09:18,535 --> 01:09:19,802
Damn it!

900
01:09:19,936 --> 01:09:22,405
Egress
is a steep high-g climb out

901
01:09:22,539 --> 01:09:24,207
to avoid hitting this mountain.

902
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:29,678
A steep climb at that speed,
you're pulling at least eight g's.

903
01:09:29,812 --> 01:09:31,147
Nine, minimum.

904
01:09:31,281 --> 01:09:33,983
The stress limit
of the f-18's airframe is 7.5.

905
01:09:34,117 --> 01:09:35,651
That's the accepted limit.

906
01:09:35,784 --> 01:09:37,853
To survive this mission,
you'll pull beyond that,

907
01:09:37,987 --> 01:09:40,924
even if it means
bending your airframe.

908
01:09:41,057 --> 01:09:45,228
<i>You'll be pulling so hard, you'll
weigh close to 2,000 pounds,</i>

909
01:09:45,361 --> 01:09:47,997
<i>your skull crushing
your spine...</i>

910
01:09:48,131 --> 01:09:51,334
<i>Your lungs imploding like an
elephant's sitting on your chest,</i>

911
01:09:51,468 --> 01:09:55,137
<i>fighting with everything you
have just to keep from blacking out.</i>

912
01:09:57,072 --> 01:09:59,908
And this is where you'll be
at your most vulnerable.

913
01:10:00,641 --> 01:10:03,278
This is coffin corner.

914
01:10:03,412 --> 01:10:05,948
Assuming you avoid crashing
into this mountain,

915
01:10:06,081 --> 01:10:09,884
you'll climb straight up into enemy
radar while losing all of your airspeed.

916
01:10:10,018 --> 01:10:13,356
Within seconds, you'll be
fired upon by enemy sams.

917
01:10:14,524 --> 01:10:17,360
You've all faced sustained
g's before, but this...

918
01:10:17,494 --> 01:10:21,364
This is gonna take you and
your aircraft to the breaking point.

919
01:10:21,498 --> 01:10:24,234
Sir, is this even achievable?

920
01:10:24,367 --> 01:10:26,236
The answer to that question

921
01:10:26,369 --> 01:10:28,904
will come down
to the pilot in the box.

922
01:10:38,314 --> 01:10:40,450
Talk to me, Bob. We are
12 seconds late on target.

923
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:43,486
We gotta move! We gotta
move! Copy. Try to stay with me.

924
01:10:46,523 --> 01:10:48,958
Huh? Wait, who's that?

925
01:10:49,892 --> 01:10:51,437
<i>Blue team, you've been spotted.</i>

926
01:10:51,461 --> 01:10:53,762
Shit, it's Maverick.
What the hell is he doing here?

927
01:10:53,896 --> 01:10:57,167
I'm a bandit on course to intercept.
Blue team, what are you gonna do?

928
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:00,569
He's 20 miles left. Ten o'clock.
700 knots closure.

929
01:11:00,701 --> 01:11:02,304
Your call.
What do you want to do?

930
01:11:02,437 --> 01:11:05,140
Continue. We're close.
Stay on target.

931
01:11:05,274 --> 01:11:08,377
He's swinging around to the
north! Stand by for pop-up.

932
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:11,712
Be ready on that laser, Bob.
Copy. I'm on it.

933
01:11:12,981 --> 01:11:14,682
Blue team,
bandit is still closing.

934
01:11:14,815 --> 01:11:15,883
Popping now.

935
01:11:22,091 --> 01:11:24,127
Talk to me, Bob.
Where's Maverick?

936
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:26,728
He's five miles out.
He's coming fast.

937
01:11:32,202 --> 01:11:35,338
Target's in sight.
Where's my laser, Bob?

938
01:11:35,471 --> 01:11:38,908
Dead eye! Dead eye! It's no good.
Sorry, I can't get a lock.

939
01:11:39,042 --> 01:11:41,144
We're out of time.
I'm dropping blind.

940
01:11:44,314 --> 01:11:45,881
Damn it, missed!

941
01:11:56,426 --> 01:11:58,194
That's tone.

942
01:11:58,328 --> 01:12:00,762
Maverick's got missile
lock on us. Shit! We're dead.

943
01:12:01,531 --> 01:12:02,932
Blue team, that's a fail.

944
01:12:03,066 --> 01:12:04,267
Level out, coyote.

945
01:12:06,768 --> 01:12:08,938
<i>Coyote? Do you copy?</i>

946
01:12:11,574 --> 01:12:13,509
<i>Coyote, come in.</i>

947
01:12:13,643 --> 01:12:15,511
<i>Coyote, level wings.</i>

948
01:12:15,645 --> 01:12:17,046
Oh, god. He's in g-loc.

949
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:20,282
<i>Coyote? Coyote?</i>

950
01:12:20,415 --> 01:12:23,018
He's gonna burn in!
I'm going after him.

951
01:12:25,954 --> 01:12:28,357
Come on. Give me tone,
give me tone, give me tone.

952
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:31,994
Snap out
of it, coyote. Come on! Come on!

953
01:12:34,796 --> 01:12:37,367
Come on, coyote, come on.
Come on!

954
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,535
<i>- Damn it! Coyote! Coyote!
- Pull up!</i>

955
01:12:39,669 --> 01:12:42,804
<i>- Coyote! Coyote!
- Pull up! Pull up!</i>

956
01:12:47,744 --> 01:12:49,312
Coyote, you okay? You okay?

957
01:12:49,445 --> 01:12:52,448
I'm okay. I'm good.

958
01:12:53,216 --> 01:12:56,319
Good. Good.
That's enough for today.

959
01:12:58,454 --> 01:12:59,555
That was close.

960
01:12:59,689 --> 01:13:01,224
Too close.

961
01:13:01,924 --> 01:13:03,993
Bird strike! Bird strike!

962
01:13:04,127 --> 01:13:06,095
Bird strike!

963
01:13:08,498 --> 01:13:11,467
Phoenix, left engine's
on fire! Climbing.

964
01:13:13,236 --> 01:13:15,771
Throttling back. Shutting
off fuel to left engine.

965
01:13:15,903 --> 01:13:17,838
Extinguishing fire.

966
01:13:18,974 --> 01:13:20,841
Right engine is out!

967
01:13:20,976 --> 01:13:22,644
It's still spinning.
Trying to restart it.

968
01:13:25,113 --> 01:13:26,114
Phoenix, it's on fire.

969
01:13:26,248 --> 01:13:28,050
Don't start... throttling up.

970
01:13:29,484 --> 01:13:30,919
Oh, my god.

971
01:13:33,989 --> 01:13:36,258
We're on fire! We're on fire!
Damn it!

972
01:13:36,391 --> 01:13:39,428
<i>Engine fire.
Right.</i> Extinguishing right engine.

973
01:13:42,431 --> 01:13:44,334
Phoenix, Bob,
punch out, punch out!

974
01:13:44,467 --> 01:13:46,536
Warning lights everywhere!
Hydraulic failure!

975
01:13:46,669 --> 01:13:48,638
<i>Flight controls.</i>
I can't control it.

976
01:13:48,771 --> 01:13:51,292
We're going down, Phoenix!
We're going in! We're going in!

977
01:13:51,374 --> 01:13:54,010
You can't save it.
Eject, eject!

978
01:13:54,143 --> 01:13:55,311
Eject, eject, eject!

979
01:13:55,445 --> 01:13:58,448
<i>Altitude. Altitude.</i>

980
01:14:19,635 --> 01:14:22,772
They'll keep Phoenix and Bob in
the hospital overnight for observation.

981
01:14:22,904 --> 01:14:24,540
They're gonna be okay.

982
01:14:28,578 --> 01:14:30,079
That's good.

983
01:14:33,182 --> 01:14:35,151
I've never lost a wing man.

984
01:14:35,718 --> 01:14:37,286
You're lucky.

985
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:39,455
Fly long enough, it'll happen.

986
01:14:42,058 --> 01:14:44,026
There will be others.

987
01:14:46,395 --> 01:14:48,630
Easy for you to say.
No wife.

988
01:14:50,565 --> 01:14:52,334
No kids.

989
01:14:52,467 --> 01:14:55,238
Nobody to mourn you
when you burn in.

990
01:14:58,408 --> 01:14:59,909
Go home.

991
01:15:00,777 --> 01:15:02,378
Just get some sleep.

992
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,883
Why'd you pull my papers
at the academy?

993
01:15:07,016 --> 01:15:08,951
Why did you stand in my way?

994
01:15:11,187 --> 01:15:12,588
You weren't ready.

995
01:15:12,722 --> 01:15:14,190
Ready for what?

996
01:15:15,024 --> 01:15:17,260
Huh? Ready to fly like you? No.

997
01:15:17,393 --> 01:15:19,028
Ready to forget the book.

998
01:15:19,162 --> 01:15:21,664
Trust your instincts.
Don't think, just do.

999
01:15:21,798 --> 01:15:24,967
You think up there,
you're dead. Believe me.

1000
01:15:25,968 --> 01:15:27,937
My dad believed in you.

1001
01:15:30,272 --> 01:15:33,074
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake.

1002
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:40,215
Maverick.

1003
01:15:50,425 --> 01:15:53,562
Ready, aim, fire.

1004
01:15:58,333 --> 01:15:59,501
Ready,

1005
01:15:59,901 --> 01:16:01,203
aim,

1006
01:16:01,336 --> 01:16:03,038
fire.

1007
01:16:12,849 --> 01:16:14,250
Ready,

1008
01:16:15,051 --> 01:16:16,486
aim,

1009
01:16:16,619 --> 01:16:18,087
fire.

1010
01:16:51,487 --> 01:16:54,557
I can only imagine what
you must be feeling right now.

1011
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:57,961
Take some time.
Whatever you need.

1012
01:16:58,094 --> 01:17:00,530
I appreciate that, sir, but
there is no time. The mission...

1013
01:17:00,663 --> 01:17:03,165
I'll be taking over
the training from here.

1014
01:17:03,934 --> 01:17:05,134
Sir?

1015
01:17:06,269 --> 01:17:07,947
We both know you didn't
want this job, captain.

1016
01:17:07,971 --> 01:17:10,373
Sir, they're not ready. It was
your job to get them ready.

1017
01:17:10,506 --> 01:17:13,808
Sir, they have to believe
that this mission can be flown.

1018
01:17:13,943 --> 01:17:17,178
And all you've managed to do
is teach them that it can't.

1019
01:17:17,981 --> 01:17:20,017
Sir... you're grounded, captain.

1020
01:17:20,149 --> 01:17:21,784
Permanently.

1021
01:17:25,454 --> 01:17:27,290
Sir... that is all.

1022
01:17:45,507 --> 01:17:46,541
I heard.

1023
01:17:48,743 --> 01:17:50,111
I'm sorry.

1024
01:17:50,812 --> 01:17:52,547
What are you gonna do?

1025
01:17:53,648 --> 01:17:55,116
Ice is gone.

1026
01:17:57,319 --> 01:17:59,321
What choice do I have?

1027
01:18:00,322 --> 01:18:02,857
You'll have to find a
way back on your own.

1028
01:18:02,992 --> 01:18:04,426
No, penny.

1029
01:18:06,028 --> 01:18:07,529
I'm out.

1030
01:18:09,097 --> 01:18:10,532
This is over.

1031
01:18:10,967 --> 01:18:12,001
Pete.

1032
01:18:12,133 --> 01:18:14,502
If you lost
your wing man up there,

1033
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:16,871
you'd keep fighting.

1034
01:18:17,006 --> 01:18:18,440
You wouldn't just give up.

1035
01:18:19,075 --> 01:18:21,276
Those are your pilots.

1036
01:18:22,277 --> 01:18:25,081
If anything happens to them,

1037
01:18:25,213 --> 01:18:27,549
you'll never forgive yourself.

1038
01:18:31,354 --> 01:18:33,489
I don't know what to do.

1039
01:18:37,393 --> 01:18:39,161
But you'll find a way.

1040
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:42,665
I know you will.

1041
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,802
<i>Captain Mitchell
is no longer your instructor.</i>

1042
01:18:46,937 --> 01:18:50,139
And as of today, there are
new mission parameters.

1043
01:18:50,272 --> 01:18:52,642
Time to target is now
four minutes.

1044
01:18:52,775 --> 01:18:55,344
You'll be entering the
valley level at reduced speed.

1045
01:18:55,478 --> 01:18:58,180
Not to exceed 420 knots.

1046
01:18:58,314 --> 01:19:01,018
Sir, won't we be giving
their planes time to intercept?

1047
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:03,831
Well, lieutenant, you have a
fighting chance against enemy aircraft.

1048
01:19:03,886 --> 01:19:06,889
What are the odds of surviving a
head-on collision with a mountain?

1049
01:19:07,024 --> 01:19:09,759
You'll be attacking the target
from a higher altitude,

1050
01:19:09,892 --> 01:19:11,227
level with the north wall.

1051
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,462
Gonna be a little harder
to keep your lase on target,

1052
01:19:13,596 --> 01:19:15,464
but you will avoid
the high-g climb out.

1053
01:19:15,598 --> 01:19:18,200
We'll be sitting ducks
for enemy missiles.

1054
01:19:23,305 --> 01:19:24,707
Who the hell is that?

1055
01:19:26,143 --> 01:19:29,146
<i>Maverick to range
control. Entering point Alpha.</i>

1056
01:19:29,278 --> 01:19:31,213
Confirm green range.

1057
01:19:31,347 --> 01:19:35,484
<i>Uh, Maverick, range
control, uh, green range is confirmed.</i>

1058
01:19:35,618 --> 01:19:38,854
<i>I don't see an event scheduled
for you, sir.</i>

1059
01:19:38,989 --> 01:19:40,957
<i>Well, I'm going anyway.</i>

1060
01:19:41,091 --> 01:19:42,224
Nice.

1061
01:19:42,358 --> 01:19:44,127
<i>Setting time to target:</i>

1062
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:46,063
<i>Two minutes 15 seconds.</i>

1063
01:19:46,195 --> 01:19:47,730
2:15? That's impossible.

1064
01:19:47,863 --> 01:19:50,733
Final attack point.
Maverick's inbound.

1065
01:21:28,265 --> 01:21:31,667
Popping in three, two, one.

1066
01:21:58,028 --> 01:21:59,262
Bombs away.

1067
01:22:16,946 --> 01:22:19,547
Bull's-eye! Holy shit!

1068
01:22:20,082 --> 01:22:21,783
Yes.

1069
01:22:24,452 --> 01:22:25,486
Damn.

1070
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:41,136
You have put me
in a difficult position, captain.

1071
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:45,007
On the one hand, you have demonstrated
that this mission can be flown.

1072
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:47,809
Perhaps the only way
it can be survived.

1073
01:22:48,944 --> 01:22:50,312
On the other hand,

1074
01:22:50,445 --> 01:22:53,249
you did it by stealing a
multimillion-dollar military aircraft

1075
01:22:53,381 --> 01:22:56,718
and flying it in such a manner
that it may never be airworthy again.

1076
01:22:57,819 --> 01:23:00,788
Iceman is no longer here
to protect you.

1077
01:23:00,923 --> 01:23:03,558
I have everything I need
to have you court-martialed

1078
01:23:03,691 --> 01:23:05,727
and dishonorably discharged.

1079
01:23:06,328 --> 01:23:07,862
So what do I do?

1080
01:23:08,663 --> 01:23:09,797
Risk the lives of my pilots

1081
01:23:09,932 --> 01:23:11,967
and perhaps the success
of this mission

1082
01:23:13,335 --> 01:23:14,570
or...

1083
01:23:15,972 --> 01:23:17,573
Risk my career

1084
01:23:18,407 --> 01:23:20,442
by appointing you team leader?

1085
01:23:23,746 --> 01:23:28,484
Sir... I think the admiral's asking
a rhetorical question, captain.

1086
01:25:09,151 --> 01:25:10,852
Talk to me, goose.

1087
01:25:13,888 --> 01:25:15,723
Captain Mitchell!

1088
01:25:22,464 --> 01:25:24,233
You're where you belong.

1089
01:25:29,138 --> 01:25:30,772
Make us proud.

1090
01:25:56,632 --> 01:25:58,968
It has been an honor
flying with you.

1091
01:25:59,969 --> 01:26:03,872
Each one of you represents
the best of the best.

1092
01:26:04,007 --> 01:26:07,310
This is a very specific mission.

1093
01:26:07,444 --> 01:26:10,813
My choice is a reflection
of that and nothing more.

1094
01:26:10,947 --> 01:26:13,049
Choose your two foxtrot teams.

1095
01:26:14,484 --> 01:26:16,219
Payback and fanboy.

1096
01:26:17,253 --> 01:26:18,754
Phoenix and Bob.

1097
01:26:22,758 --> 01:26:24,760
And your wing man.

1098
01:26:29,032 --> 01:26:30,066
Rooster.

1099
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:36,638
The rest of you will stand by
on the carrier

1100
01:26:36,772 --> 01:26:39,909
for any reserve role
that's required.

1101
01:26:40,577 --> 01:26:41,945
Dismissed.

1102
01:26:49,352 --> 01:26:52,455
Your target
is a clear and present threat.

1103
01:26:53,755 --> 01:26:57,626
<i>A secret uranium enrichment
site under rogue state control.</i>

1104
01:26:57,759 --> 01:26:59,627
<i>It's an underground bunker,</i>

1105
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,829
tucked between
these two mountains.

1106
01:27:03,365 --> 01:27:06,734
<i>Your route of ingress is heavily
defended by surface-to-air missiles</i>

1107
01:27:06,868 --> 01:27:09,204
<i>backed up
by fifth-generation fighters.</i>

1108
01:27:09,338 --> 01:27:12,074
Once your f-18 strike team
crosses the border,

1109
01:27:12,207 --> 01:27:14,143
tomahawk missiles
from the USS <i>Leyte Gulf</i>

1110
01:27:14,276 --> 01:27:18,180
will launch a synchronized
strike on the enemy's airfield here.

1111
01:27:19,214 --> 01:27:21,782
<i>This will knock out
their runway.</i>

1112
01:27:23,218 --> 01:27:26,455
<i>But you'll have to contend with
any planes already in the air.</i>

1113
01:27:26,588 --> 01:27:29,891
The moment those tomahawks hit,
the enemy will know you're coming.

1114
01:27:30,825 --> 01:27:32,027
Your time to target

1115
01:27:32,161 --> 01:27:35,097
will be two minutes
and 30 seconds.

1116
01:27:36,398 --> 01:27:38,333
<i>Any longer than that,
and you will be exposed</i>

1117
01:27:38,467 --> 01:27:41,403
<i>to any aircraft
the tomahawks may have missed.</i>

1118
01:27:44,473 --> 01:27:47,242
This is what you've all
been training for.

1119
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:50,811
Come home safely.

1120
01:28:05,328 --> 01:28:07,163
You give 'em hell!

1121
01:28:19,642 --> 01:28:20,876
Sir.

1122
01:28:21,277 --> 01:28:22,278
Sir?

1123
01:28:24,447 --> 01:28:25,481
I...

1124
01:28:28,184 --> 01:28:30,119
I just want to say...

1125
01:28:39,028 --> 01:28:40,463
We'll talk

1126
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:43,366
when we get back.

1127
01:28:49,405 --> 01:28:51,274
Hey, Bradley! Bradley!

1128
01:28:52,342 --> 01:28:53,376
Hey.

1129
01:28:56,745 --> 01:28:58,314
You got this.

1130
01:29:06,622 --> 01:29:07,855
<i>Maverick.</i>

1131
01:29:10,326 --> 01:29:11,394
Maverick?

1132
01:29:12,662 --> 01:29:14,830
Hey, you with me?

1133
01:29:16,065 --> 01:29:18,167
I don't like that look, mav.

1134
01:29:20,802 --> 01:29:22,438
It's the only one I got.

1135
01:29:26,908 --> 01:29:28,410
Thank you.

1136
01:29:29,777 --> 01:29:31,779
If I don't see you again, hon do,

1137
01:29:31,913 --> 01:29:33,415
thank you.

1138
01:29:40,989 --> 01:29:43,091
It's been an honor, captain.

1139
01:30:15,991 --> 01:30:18,960
Dagger one,
up and ready on catapult one.

1140
01:30:19,094 --> 01:30:21,130
Dagger spare standing by.

1141
01:30:21,264 --> 01:30:23,032
Dagger four, up and ready.

1142
01:30:23,166 --> 01:30:24,701
Dagger three, up and ready.

1143
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:27,170
Dagger two, up and ready.

1144
01:30:28,037 --> 01:30:29,548
Support assets airborne.

1145
01:30:29,572 --> 01:30:30,740
Strike package ready.

1146
01:30:30,872 --> 01:30:33,343
Standing by for launch decision.

1147
01:30:33,476 --> 01:30:34,510
Send them.

1148
01:30:54,997 --> 01:30:56,466
Dagger two away.

1149
01:30:57,433 --> 01:30:59,335
Dagger three away.

1150
01:30:59,469 --> 01:31:01,437
Dagger four away.

1151
01:31:12,215 --> 01:31:14,984
Comanche, dagger one.
Standby check in.

1152
01:31:16,052 --> 01:31:17,352
<i>Comanche 11, set.</i>

1153
01:31:17,486 --> 01:31:19,821
Picture clean.
Recommend dagger continue.

1154
01:31:19,955 --> 01:31:22,157
Copy. Daggers descending
below radar.

1155
01:31:41,711 --> 01:31:44,614
Daggers now
below radar. Switching to e-2 picture.

1156
01:31:52,989 --> 01:31:55,390
Here we go.
Enemy territory up ahead.

1157
01:31:55,524 --> 01:31:58,427
Feet dry in 60 seconds.
Comanche, dagger one. Picture.

1158
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,530
Comanche. Picture clean.
Decision is yours.

1159
01:32:01,663 --> 01:32:03,131
Copy.

1160
01:32:11,139 --> 01:32:12,474
Dagger attack.

1161
01:32:17,012 --> 01:32:18,847
Tomahawks airborne.

1162
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:21,283
No turning back now.

1163
01:32:26,855 --> 01:32:29,124
Daggers,
assume attack formation.

1164
01:32:37,766 --> 01:32:39,701
<i>Daggers set.
Proceeding to target.</i>

1165
01:32:39,835 --> 01:32:44,574
Two minutes and 30 seconds
in three, two, one, Mark.

1166
01:32:44,707 --> 01:32:45,909
Two Mark.
Three Mark.

1167
01:32:46,042 --> 01:32:47,176
Four Mark.

1168
01:32:51,314 --> 01:32:53,082
Going in.

1169
01:33:08,364 --> 01:33:10,766
First Sam site overhead.

1170
01:33:15,037 --> 01:33:16,478
Looks like we're clear
on radar, mav.

1171
01:33:16,506 --> 01:33:18,541
Let's not take it for granted.

1172
01:33:21,912 --> 01:33:24,013
More sams! Three o'clock high!

1173
01:33:26,349 --> 01:33:28,584
- We got two minutes to target.
<i>- Copy.</i>

1174
01:33:28,718 --> 01:33:31,721
We're a few seconds behind,
rooster. We got to move.

1175
01:33:31,854 --> 01:33:35,757
Thirty seconds to
tomahawk impact on enemy airstrip.

1176
01:33:43,164 --> 01:33:44,805
Dagger, comanche.

1177
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:47,111
We're picking up two bandits.
Single group, two contacts.

1178
01:33:47,135 --> 01:33:50,338
Where the hell'd they come
from? Long-range patrol?

1179
01:33:55,111 --> 01:33:56,646
Comanche, what's their heading?

1180
01:33:56,779 --> 01:33:58,881
<i>Bull's-eye
090, 50, tacked southwest.</i>

1181
01:33:59,016 --> 01:34:01,217
They're headed away from us.
They don't know we're here.

1182
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:03,252
The second those tomahawks
hit the air base,

1183
01:34:03,386 --> 01:34:05,454
those bandits are gonna move
to defend the target.

1184
01:34:05,588 --> 01:34:08,491
We have to get there before
they do. Increase speed.

1185
01:34:09,559 --> 01:34:12,228
We got you, mav.
Don't wait for me.

1186
01:34:17,767 --> 01:34:20,902
Sir, daggers
two and four are behind schedule.

1187
01:34:21,037 --> 01:34:23,371
Time to target, one minute 20.

1188
01:34:23,505 --> 01:34:26,575
Tomahawk impact in three, two...

1189
01:34:30,645 --> 01:34:33,448
Impact.
Enemy runway is destroyed.

1190
01:34:34,115 --> 01:34:35,817
They know we're coming now.

1191
01:34:38,253 --> 01:34:41,289
Bandits are switching
course to defend the target.

1192
01:34:41,423 --> 01:34:42,757
Rooster, where are you?

1193
01:34:44,292 --> 01:34:45,938
<i>Come on, rooster.
Bandits inbound.</i>

1194
01:34:45,962 --> 01:34:48,530
We got to make up time now.
Let's turn and burn.

1195
01:34:56,271 --> 01:34:57,539
Heads up, Phoenix.

1196
01:35:01,142 --> 01:35:02,477
Whoa!

1197
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:09,885
Sir, bandits
are two minutes from target.

1198
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:11,387
Daggers are one minute
from target.

1199
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,190
Come on, rooster.
Move it or lose it.

1200
01:35:15,959 --> 01:35:18,761
Guys, we're falling behind.
We really gotta move.

1201
01:35:18,894 --> 01:35:20,763
If we don't increase our speed
right now,

1202
01:35:20,896 --> 01:35:23,866
those bandits are gonna be waiting
for us when we reach the target.

1203
01:35:25,668 --> 01:35:26,869
Talk to me, dad.

1204
01:35:28,105 --> 01:35:29,438
Come on, kid, you can do it.

1205
01:35:29,572 --> 01:35:31,841
Don't think, just do.

1206
01:35:40,216 --> 01:35:41,717
Jesus, rooster, not that fast!

1207
01:35:41,851 --> 01:35:44,520
That's it, kid, that's it.
All right, let's go.

1208
01:35:48,356 --> 01:35:49,891
Damn, rooster, take it easy.

1209
01:35:50,026 --> 01:35:53,328
Sir, dagger two is reengaging.

1210
01:35:53,461 --> 01:35:56,197
All right, now hit your target
and come home.

1211
01:36:00,301 --> 01:36:02,804
Thirty seconds to target.
Bob, check your laser.

1212
01:36:02,938 --> 01:36:06,675
Air-to-ground check complete.
Laser code verified, 1688.

1213
01:36:06,808 --> 01:36:07,910
<i>Laser is a go!</i>

1214
01:36:10,146 --> 01:36:11,680
Watch your heads.

1215
01:36:13,248 --> 01:36:14,549
Holy shit! Shit!

1216
01:36:14,683 --> 01:36:16,819
Payback, you with me?
Right behind you.

1217
01:36:17,687 --> 01:36:19,488
Phoenix, stand by
for pop-up strike.

1218
01:36:19,622 --> 01:36:21,290
Dagger three in position.

1219
01:36:22,025 --> 01:36:24,593
Popping in three, two, one.

1220
01:36:52,387 --> 01:36:54,823
Get me eyes on that
target, Bob. Dagger three.

1221
01:36:55,890 --> 01:36:57,692
<i>Stand by, mav.</i>
Come on, Bob, come on.

1222
01:36:57,826 --> 01:36:59,661
Stand by.

1223
01:36:59,794 --> 01:37:02,831
I've got it. Captured!
Target acquired. Bombs away.

1224
01:37:23,651 --> 01:37:27,089
We've got impact!
Check, direct hit! Direct hit!

1225
01:37:27,223 --> 01:37:29,025
That's miracle number one.

1226
01:37:29,625 --> 01:37:31,094
Dagger two, status.

1227
01:37:31,228 --> 01:37:32,862
Almost there, mav. Almost there.

1228
01:37:35,364 --> 01:37:36,766
Fanboy, where's my laser?

1229
01:37:36,899 --> 01:37:39,568
Rooster, there's something wrong
with this laser!

1230
01:37:39,702 --> 01:37:41,204
Shit! Dead eye, dead eye, dead eye!

1231
01:37:41,337 --> 01:37:43,639
Come on, guys, we're
running out of time. Get it online!

1232
01:37:43,773 --> 01:37:45,274
<i>I'm trying!
Come on, fanboy!</i>

1233
01:37:45,407 --> 01:37:47,376
Nearly there! Nearly there!

1234
01:37:56,219 --> 01:37:58,563
Come on, fanboy, get it online.
There's no time. I'm dropping blind.

1235
01:37:58,587 --> 01:38:00,689
Rooster, I got this!
No time. Pull up.

1236
01:38:00,823 --> 01:38:02,992
Wait!
Bombs away! Bombs away!

1237
01:38:15,570 --> 01:38:17,872
Bull's-eye,
bull's-eye, bull's-eye!

1238
01:38:21,609 --> 01:38:22,777
Miracle number two.

1239
01:38:22,912 --> 01:38:24,546
Now they're in coffin corner.

1240
01:38:24,679 --> 01:38:26,982
We're not out of this yet.

1241
01:38:28,817 --> 01:38:30,385
Here it comes.

1242
01:38:32,988 --> 01:38:35,257
Radar warning! Smoke in
the air. Phoenix, break right.

1243
01:38:35,390 --> 01:38:37,559
Emergency jettison.
Dagger three defending.

1244
01:38:37,692 --> 01:38:39,461
Here comes another one!

1245
01:38:39,595 --> 01:38:41,564
Dagger one defending.

1246
01:38:47,570 --> 01:38:48,871
Rooster, status.

1247
01:38:57,013 --> 01:38:58,048
Oh, my god.

1248
01:38:59,983 --> 01:39:01,750
Smoke in the air!
Smoke in the air!

1249
01:39:02,818 --> 01:39:04,955
Break right, payback!
Breaking right.

1250
01:39:06,056 --> 01:39:08,058
Oh, my god, here they come!

1251
01:39:08,191 --> 01:39:09,725
Sam on your six, rooster!

1252
01:39:11,061 --> 01:39:12,595
Deploying countermeasures.

1253
01:39:15,231 --> 01:39:16,865
Negative contact.

1254
01:39:18,666 --> 01:39:19,969
Dagger one defending.

1255
01:39:21,070 --> 01:39:23,906
Talk to me, Bob. Break right,
Phoenix! Break right! Mav!

1256
01:39:24,039 --> 01:39:25,874
<i>Nine o'clock! Nine o'clock!</i>

1257
01:39:26,909 --> 01:39:28,409
<i>Rooster, two more on your six.</i>

1258
01:39:28,543 --> 01:39:30,145
Dagger two, defending.

1259
01:39:34,582 --> 01:39:36,784
Payback, Sam on your nose.
Dagger four defending.

1260
01:39:36,919 --> 01:39:38,629
Rooster, tally, seven o'clock!
Talk to me, Bob!

1261
01:39:38,653 --> 01:39:39,934
On our six!
Dagger two defending.

1262
01:39:40,022 --> 01:39:41,656
- Phoenix, break right!
<i>- I see it!</i>

1263
01:39:49,231 --> 01:39:50,766
Dagger two defending.

1264
01:39:51,834 --> 01:39:53,103
Shit, I'm out of flares!

1265
01:39:53,236 --> 01:39:55,238
Rooster, evade, evade!

1266
01:39:55,372 --> 01:39:58,008
I can't shake 'em!
They're on me! They're on me!

1267
01:40:08,084 --> 01:40:09,818
Mav! No!

1268
01:40:11,587 --> 01:40:15,125
Dagger one is hit!
I repeat, dagger one is hit!

1269
01:40:15,258 --> 01:40:16,592
<i>Maverick is down.</i>

1270
01:40:16,725 --> 01:40:17,994
<i>Dagger one, status.</i>

1271
01:40:18,128 --> 01:40:19,560
<i>Status!</i>

1272
01:40:19,694 --> 01:40:21,729
<i>Anyone see him?
Does anyone see him?</i>

1273
01:40:21,863 --> 01:40:24,199
Dagger one, come in!
I didn't see a parachute.

1274
01:40:24,333 --> 01:40:25,767
We have to circle back.

1275
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:28,436
Comanche.
Bandits inbound. Single group, hot.

1276
01:40:28,569 --> 01:40:30,205
Recommend dagger flow south.

1277
01:40:31,206 --> 01:40:33,075
<i>One minute to intercept.</i>

1278
01:40:36,045 --> 01:40:39,214
Get 'em back to the carrier
now. All daggers flow to ecp.

1279
01:40:39,348 --> 01:40:41,429
<i>You have bandits headed
for you.</i> What about Maverick?

1280
01:40:41,482 --> 01:40:44,286
Tell him there's nothing he can do
for Maverick, not in a goddamn f-18.

1281
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:47,722
Dagger spare request permission
to launch and fly air cover.

1282
01:40:49,724 --> 01:40:51,060
Negative, spare.

1283
01:40:51,859 --> 01:40:52,962
Launch search and rescue.

1284
01:40:53,095 --> 01:40:54,538
Negative.
Not with bandits in the air.

1285
01:40:54,562 --> 01:40:55,907
But, sir,
Maverick is still out there.

1286
01:40:55,931 --> 01:40:58,233
We are not losing
anyone else today.

1287
01:41:00,169 --> 01:41:01,503
Get 'em home now.

1288
01:41:01,637 --> 01:41:04,207
Dagger, you are not to engage.

1289
01:41:04,341 --> 01:41:06,142
Repeat, do not engage.

1290
01:41:06,276 --> 01:41:09,478
<i>Dagger two,
return to carrier. Acknowledge.</i>

1291
01:41:09,611 --> 01:41:10,646
<i>Acknowledge.</i>

1292
01:41:10,779 --> 01:41:13,016
Rooster,
those bandits are closing.

1293
01:41:13,149 --> 01:41:14,184
We can't go back.

1294
01:41:14,317 --> 01:41:17,253
Rooster, he's gone.

1295
01:41:18,754 --> 01:41:20,589
<i>Maverick's gone.</i>

1296
01:42:50,745 --> 01:42:51,980
Oh, no, no.

1297
01:42:58,287 --> 01:43:00,155
<i>Dagger two is hit.</i>

1298
01:43:01,256 --> 01:43:02,357
Dagger two is hit.

1299
01:43:03,791 --> 01:43:05,660
Dagger two, come in.

1300
01:43:06,861 --> 01:43:08,931
Dagger two, do you copy?

1301
01:43:09,897 --> 01:43:11,934
<i>Dagger two, come in.</i>

1302
01:43:37,127 --> 01:43:38,127
You all right?

1303
01:43:38,161 --> 01:43:40,063
Yeah, I'm good.
You all right?

1304
01:43:42,298 --> 01:43:44,501
What the hell?
What are you doing here?

1305
01:43:44,633 --> 01:43:46,835
What am I doing here?
You think I took that missile

1306
01:43:46,970 --> 01:43:48,505
so you could be
down here with me?

1307
01:43:48,637 --> 01:43:50,373
You should be back
on the carrier by now!

1308
01:43:50,507 --> 01:43:52,008
I saved your life!

1309
01:43:52,142 --> 01:43:55,178
I saved your life.
That's the whole point.

1310
01:43:55,311 --> 01:43:57,280
What the hell
were you even thinking?

1311
01:43:57,413 --> 01:43:59,715
You told me not to think!

1312
01:44:16,231 --> 01:44:17,332
Well,

1313
01:44:18,766 --> 01:44:20,102
it's good to see you.

1314
01:44:22,571 --> 01:44:24,173
It's good to see you too.

1315
01:44:27,943 --> 01:44:29,744
So what's the plan?

1316
01:44:40,623 --> 01:44:42,025
You're not serious.

1317
01:44:57,039 --> 01:44:59,141
You've got to be shitting me.

1318
01:45:01,109 --> 01:45:02,578
An f-14?

1319
01:45:02,710 --> 01:45:04,279
I shot down three migs
in one of those.

1320
01:45:04,413 --> 01:45:07,182
We don't even know
if that bag of ass can fly.

1321
01:45:09,717 --> 01:45:11,920
Let's find out.
Mav!

1322
01:45:13,589 --> 01:45:14,822
Okay.

1323
01:45:24,032 --> 01:45:27,135
There's guys up there, mav.
Yeah.

1324
01:45:27,269 --> 01:45:30,239
There's more
over there. Okay.

1325
01:45:30,372 --> 01:45:32,975
- Let's start running.
- Yeah, run. Run.

1326
01:45:42,117 --> 01:45:45,053
Once... once I give you
the signal for air,

1327
01:45:45,187 --> 01:45:47,823
you're gonna flip this switch
until the needle gets to 120.

1328
01:45:47,957 --> 01:45:49,325
When the engine starts,

1329
01:45:49,459 --> 01:45:51,760
you got to pull out the pins
and disconnect everything.

1330
01:45:51,893 --> 01:45:53,563
You understand?
Yeah.

1331
01:45:55,764 --> 01:45:57,000
Yes!

1332
01:45:58,668 --> 01:46:01,037
Once I'm up, stow the ladder.

1333
01:46:08,745 --> 01:46:11,014
Okay. Wow.

1334
01:46:11,914 --> 01:46:14,017
It's been a minute, huh, mav?

1335
01:46:42,477 --> 01:46:45,880
Oh, my god.
This thing is so old.

1336
01:46:46,648 --> 01:46:47,882
All right.

1337
01:46:52,721 --> 01:46:54,389
Canopy?
Clear.

1338
01:47:12,541 --> 01:47:14,875
Both runways are cratered.

1339
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:17,312
How we gonna get this
museum piece in the air?

1340
01:47:27,389 --> 01:47:29,157
Why are the wings
coming out, mav?

1341
01:47:35,464 --> 01:47:38,166
Mav, this is a taxiway,
not a runway.

1342
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:41,770
This is a very short
taxiway, mav.

1343
01:47:41,902 --> 01:47:43,305
Just hang on.

1344
01:47:44,539 --> 01:47:46,074
Holy shit!

1345
01:47:51,879 --> 01:47:53,048
Come on, come on, come on.

1346
01:47:53,181 --> 01:47:55,117
Needle's alive. Come on.

1347
01:47:57,552 --> 01:47:59,887
Mav?
That's it. Come on, come on!

1348
01:48:00,021 --> 01:48:01,289
All right.

1349
01:48:01,990 --> 01:48:04,226
Mav!
Here we go.

1350
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:07,129
Holy shit.

1351
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:23,713
Sir, we're receiving a signal
from rooster's esat.

1352
01:48:23,846 --> 01:48:25,715
But there seems to be
a malfunction.

1353
01:48:25,848 --> 01:48:27,350
Have you lost him?
No, sir.

1354
01:48:28,251 --> 01:48:29,685
He's supersonic.

1355
01:48:30,219 --> 01:48:31,487
He's airborne.

1356
01:48:32,655 --> 01:48:34,557
In what?
Sir.

1357
01:48:34,690 --> 01:48:39,295
Over watch reports an f-14 tomcat is
airborne and on course for our position.

1358
01:48:40,029 --> 01:48:42,698
Can't be. It can't be!

1359
01:48:44,434 --> 01:48:45,468
Maverick.

1360
01:48:47,437 --> 01:48:49,839
Okay, rooster,
get us in touch with the boat.

1361
01:48:49,972 --> 01:48:51,441
I'm working on it.

1362
01:48:51,574 --> 01:48:54,677
Radio's out. No radar.
Everything's dead back here.

1363
01:48:54,811 --> 01:48:57,915
What do I do? Talk me
through it. Okay, first the radio.

1364
01:48:58,047 --> 01:48:59,917
Throw the, uh...

1365
01:49:00,049 --> 01:49:03,218
The uhf-2 circuit breaker.
Try that.

1366
01:49:03,351 --> 01:49:06,254
There's 300 breakers back here.
Anything more specific?

1367
01:49:06,388 --> 01:49:08,490
I don't know.
That was your dad's department.

1368
01:49:08,623 --> 01:49:10,225
I'll figure it out.

1369
01:49:13,261 --> 01:49:15,630
Mav, tally two, 5:00 low.

1370
01:49:20,869 --> 01:49:22,204
What do we do?

1371
01:49:22,871 --> 01:49:24,739
Okay, listen. Just be cool.

1372
01:49:24,873 --> 01:49:27,542
If they knew who we were,
we'd be dead already.

1373
01:49:29,144 --> 01:49:31,046
Well, here they come.

1374
01:49:31,179 --> 01:49:34,483
What's your plan?
Just put your mask on.

1375
01:49:35,450 --> 01:49:38,153
Remember,
we're on the same team.

1376
01:49:40,689 --> 01:49:42,557
Just wave and smile.

1377
01:49:43,158 --> 01:49:44,759
<i>Just wave and smile.</i>

1378
01:49:51,633 --> 01:49:53,401
What's that signal?
What's he saying?

1379
01:49:53,535 --> 01:49:57,005
No idea.
I have no idea what he's saying.

1380
01:49:57,138 --> 01:50:01,076
What about that one? Any
idea? No, never seen that one either.

1381
01:50:03,913 --> 01:50:08,183
Oh, shit. His wing man is moving
into weapons envelope.

1382
01:50:08,817 --> 01:50:10,318
All right, listen up.

1383
01:50:10,452 --> 01:50:13,021
When I tell you, you grab
those rings above your head.

1384
01:50:13,154 --> 01:50:14,823
That's the ejection handle.

1385
01:50:15,757 --> 01:50:18,226
<i>Mav, can we outrun these guys?</i>

1386
01:50:18,961 --> 01:50:21,096
Not their missiles and guns.

1387
01:50:25,333 --> 01:50:27,269
Then it's a dogfight.

1388
01:50:27,402 --> 01:50:30,505
An f-14 against
fifth-gen fighters?

1389
01:50:31,707 --> 01:50:34,310
It's not the plane,
it's the pilot.

1390
01:50:35,545 --> 01:50:37,713
You'd go after 'em
if I wasn't here.

1391
01:50:38,281 --> 01:50:40,216
But you are here.

1392
01:50:40,816 --> 01:50:42,318
Come on, mav.

1393
01:50:43,219 --> 01:50:44,587
Don't think.

1394
01:50:45,755 --> 01:50:46,822
Just do.

1395
01:51:02,305 --> 01:51:04,507
Tell me when you see
smoke in the air.

1396
01:51:08,578 --> 01:51:11,080
Smoke in the air!
Smoke in the air! Hang on.

1397
01:51:13,516 --> 01:51:16,352
Yeah, mav! Splash one!
Splash one!

1398
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:23,459
Here comes another one.

1399
01:51:25,963 --> 01:51:28,229
Rooster, flares!
Now, now, now!

1400
01:51:31,333 --> 01:51:32,767
Splitting the throttles.

1401
01:51:34,868 --> 01:51:36,203
Coming around.

1402
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:41,954
Give me tone, give me tone.

1403
01:51:41,978 --> 01:51:44,579
You got him, mav! You
got him! Taking the shot.

1404
01:51:50,552 --> 01:51:51,786
What the...

1405
01:51:52,554 --> 01:51:54,889
Holy shit!
What the fuck was that?

1406
01:51:56,191 --> 01:51:58,326
Hang on. We gotta get low.

1407
01:51:58,460 --> 01:52:01,129
The terrain will confuse
his targeting system.

1408
01:52:02,999 --> 01:52:04,165
Here he comes!

1409
01:52:16,578 --> 01:52:18,446
Talk to me, rooster.
Where is he?

1410
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:20,548
He's still on us!

1411
01:52:27,455 --> 01:52:29,758
We took a hit! We took a hit!
Damn it!

1412
01:52:34,596 --> 01:52:37,066
Come on, mav. Do some of
that pilot shit. Brace yourself.

1413
01:52:47,709 --> 01:52:48,777
Holy shit.

1414
01:52:55,584 --> 01:52:57,687
I got tone. Taking the shot.

1415
01:53:02,025 --> 01:53:03,459
Damn it!

1416
01:53:04,226 --> 01:53:07,229
Out of missiles.
Switching to guns.

1417
01:53:12,902 --> 01:53:14,236
Come on, mav, come on.

1418
01:53:16,539 --> 01:53:18,474
You got him, mav!
It's not over yet.

1419
01:53:22,812 --> 01:53:24,915
One last chance.
You can do this.

1420
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:27,918
Come on, Maverick.

1421
01:53:37,259 --> 01:53:39,428
Yes! Splash two!

1422
01:53:50,238 --> 01:53:51,907
Mav, I got the radio on.
Outstanding.

1423
01:53:52,041 --> 01:53:54,110
Get us in touch with
the boat. Copy that.

1424
01:53:56,376 --> 01:53:57,778
Oh, my god.

1425
01:53:59,546 --> 01:54:01,515
Where the hell is this guy?

1426
01:54:02,549 --> 01:54:04,452
He's on our nose.

1427
01:54:06,821 --> 01:54:08,958
Damn it, we're out of ammo.

1428
01:54:10,825 --> 01:54:13,528
Smoke in the air!
Rooster, flares!

1429
01:54:15,931 --> 01:54:17,398
That was close.

1430
01:54:19,534 --> 01:54:21,703
We're out of flares, mav.

1431
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:27,842
Shit, he's already on us.

1432
01:54:32,081 --> 01:54:34,482
This is not good.

1433
01:54:42,390 --> 01:54:44,592
We took another hit!
No, no, no, no, no!

1434
01:54:49,198 --> 01:54:51,366
We can't take much more of this.

1435
01:54:51,499 --> 01:54:53,235
We can't outrun this guy.
We got to eject.

1436
01:54:53,368 --> 01:54:54,636
What?
We need altitude.

1437
01:54:54,769 --> 01:54:56,771
Pull the ejection handles
the second I tell you.

1438
01:54:56,906 --> 01:54:59,074
Mav, wait! Rooster,
there's no other way.

1439
01:55:02,244 --> 01:55:03,645
Eject, eject, eject!

1440
01:55:03,778 --> 01:55:06,548
Rooster,
pull the handle! Eject!

1441
01:55:06,681 --> 01:55:08,583
It's not working!

1442
01:55:18,427 --> 01:55:21,664
Mav!

1443
01:55:22,631 --> 01:55:24,333
I'm sorry.

1444
01:55:25,501 --> 01:55:27,336
I'm sorry, goose.

1445
01:55:39,682 --> 01:55:41,483
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

1446
01:55:41,617 --> 01:55:43,619
This is your savior speaking.

1447
01:55:43,752 --> 01:55:45,554
<i>Please fasten your seat belts,</i>

1448
01:55:45,688 --> 01:55:48,225
<i>return your tray tables to their
locked and upright positions...</i>

1449
01:55:49,458 --> 01:55:51,894
<i>And prepare for landing.</i>

1450
01:55:54,130 --> 01:55:56,266
Hey, hangman, you look good.

1451
01:55:56,398 --> 01:55:59,902
I am good, rooster.
I'm very good.

1452
01:56:01,604 --> 01:56:03,572
<i>I'll see you back on deck.</i>

1453
01:56:25,059 --> 01:56:27,662
Maverick is downwind.
No front landing gear.

1454
01:56:27,795 --> 01:56:29,999
No tail hook. Pull the cable
and raise the barricade.

1455
01:56:30,132 --> 01:56:32,634
Foul deck! Foul deck!
Raise the barricade!

1456
01:56:33,468 --> 01:56:35,004
Go!

1457
01:56:57,192 --> 01:56:59,427
Please don't tell me
we lost an engine.

1458
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:02,497
All right, I won't
tell you that. Okay.

1459
01:57:26,422 --> 01:57:27,488
You good?

1460
01:57:27,622 --> 01:57:29,590
Yeah. I'm good.

1461
01:58:14,903 --> 01:58:17,740
Chalked yourself another
kill. That makes two.

1462
01:58:18,308 --> 01:58:19,508
Mav has five.

1463
01:58:19,641 --> 01:58:21,176
Makes him an ace.

1464
01:58:39,128 --> 01:58:41,696
Captain Mitchell!
Captain Mitchell!

1465
01:58:48,336 --> 01:58:49,771
Sir.

1466
01:58:57,012 --> 01:58:58,947
Thank you for saving my life.

1467
01:59:00,049 --> 01:59:02,184
It's what my dad would've done.

1468
01:59:41,356 --> 01:59:42,590
Hey, mav.

1469
01:59:43,425 --> 01:59:44,725
Jimmy.

1470
01:59:45,660 --> 01:59:46,894
Is, uh...

1471
01:59:47,595 --> 01:59:48,931
Is penny around?

1472
01:59:49,064 --> 01:59:52,700
Uh, she took Amelia
on a sailing trip.

1473
01:59:54,937 --> 01:59:57,072
Did she say when she'd be back?

1474
01:59:57,206 --> 01:59:59,041
You know, she didn't.

1475
02:00:01,277 --> 02:00:03,046
Can I get you anything?

1476
02:00:16,292 --> 02:00:17,327
Get in there.
