1
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,190
<i>I shall tell you of William Wallace.</i>

2
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,810
<i>Historians from England will say I am a liar.</i>

3
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,940
<i>But history is written by those
who have hanged heroes.</i>

4
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,650
<i>The King of Scotland had died without a son.</i>

5
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,820
<i>And the King of England...</i>

6
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,330
<i>...a cruel pagan known as
Edward the Longshanks...</i>

7
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,830
<i>...claimed the throne of Scotland for himself.</i>

8
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,830
<i>Scotland's nobles fought him...</i>

9
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,550
<i>...and fought each other over the crown.</i>

10
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,340
<i>So Longshanks invited them
to talks of a truce.</i>

11
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,100
<i>No weapons. One page only.</i>

12
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,690
<i>One farmer of that shire
was Malcolm Wallace...</i>

13
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,850
<i>...a commoner with his own lands.</i>

14
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,480
<i>He had two sons: John and William.</i>

15
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,870
I told you to stay!

16
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,910
Well, I finished my work.
Where are we going?

17
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,210
MacAndrews'. He was supposed
to visit after the gathering.

18
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,330
- Can I come?
- No! Go home, boy!

19
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,130
- But I want to go!
- Go home, or you'll feel the back of my hand!

20
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,630
Away hame, William.

21
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,790
MacAndrews!

22
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,210
MacAndrews!

23
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,010
Holy Jesus.

24
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,680
- William! William!

25
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,310
It's all right, it's all right. Easy, lad.

26
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,420
And I say we hit back now!

27
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,920
- We cannae fight them.
- Something's got to be done.

28
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,710
Wallace is right! We fight them!

29
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,590
Every nobleman willing to fight
was at that meeting!

30
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,050
We cannot beat an army!
Not with the 50 farmers we can raise.

31
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,180
We do not have to beat them...
Just fight them.

32
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,560
- Now, who's with me?
- I am, Wallace.

33
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,020
- All right, all right.
- Aye.

34
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,290
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm going with you.

35
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,000
Och, are ye?
And what are you going to do?

36
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,170
I'm gonna help.

37
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,130
Aye, and a good help you'd be, too.

38
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,760
But I need you to stay here...

39
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,970
...and look after the place for me
while I'm away.

40
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,640
I can fight!

41
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,320
I know! I know you can fight.

42
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:08,030
But it's our wits that make us men.

43
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,870
See ye tomorrow.

44
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,910
- English!
- Get down.

45
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,370
With your father and brother gone,
they'll kill us and burn the farm!

46
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,250
It's up to us, Hamish.

47
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,520
Nah!

48
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,610
Da?

49
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,570
Da?

50
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,615
William.

51
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:28,280
Come here, lad.

52
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,870
<i>De profundis...</i>

53
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,250
<i>...clamavi ad te, Domine.</i>

54
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:31,300
<i>Domine, exaudi vocem meam.</i>

55
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,840
<i>Fiant aures tuae intendentes...</i>

56
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:42,140
<i>...in vocem deprecationis meae.</i>

57
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:48,230
<i>Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine.</i>

58
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,030
<i>Et lux perpetua luceat eis.</i>

59
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,860
<i>Requiescant in pace.</i>

60
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,780
Amen.

61
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,660
Amen.

62
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,030
William.

63
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,740
I'm your uncle. Argyle.

64
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,290
You have the look of your mother.

65
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,020
We'll stay here tonight.
Tomorrow, you'll come home with me.

66
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,230
I don't want to leave!

67
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,270
You didn't want your father
to die either, did you?

68
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,990
But it happened.

69
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,410
Did the priest give a poetic benediction?

70
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,830
- The Lord bless thee and keep thee...
- It was in Latin.

71
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,620
You don't speak Latin?

72
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,420
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy.

73
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,300
The Lord...

74
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,840
...bless thee and keep thee.

75
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,140
The Lord cause his light to shine on thee.

76
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,680
The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee...

77
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,520
...and give thee peace.

78
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,400
Amen.

79
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,030
<i>Your heart is free.</i>

80
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,660
<i>Have the courage to follow it.</i>

81
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,560
What are they doing?

82
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,940
Saying goodbye in their own way.

83
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:05,240
Playing outlawed tunes on outlawed pipes.

84
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,080
It was the same for me and your daddy...

85
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,920
...when our father was killed.

86
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,660
First, learn to use...

87
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,660
...this.

88
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,490
Then I'll teach you... to use...

89
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,960
...this.

90
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,610
<i>Many years later...</i>

91
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,950
<i>...Edward the Longshanks,
King of England...</i>

92
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,660
<i>...supervised the wedding of his eldest son,
who would succeed him as king.</i>

93
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,580
Amen.

94
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,710
<i>As bride for his son...</i>

95
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,220
<i>...Longshanks had chosen
the daughter of his rival...</i>

96
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,100
<i>...the King of France.</i>

97
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,040
<i>It was widely whispered
that for the Princess to conceive...</i>

98
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,460
<i>...Longshanks would have
to do the honors himself.</i>

99
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:28,760
<i>That may have been
what he had in mind all along.</i>

100
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,470
Scotland...

101
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,680
My land.

102
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,560
The French will grovel
to anyone with strength.

103
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:48,650
But how will they believe our strength
when we cannot rule the whole of our island?

104
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,830
Where is my son?

105
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,000
Your pardon, my Lord.

106
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,460
He asked me to come in his stead.

107
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,960
I sent for him and he sends you?

108
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,880
Shall I leave, my Lord?

109
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,220
If he wants his queen to rule
when I am gone...

110
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:20,180
...then by all means stay
and learn how. Please.

111
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,350
Nobles.

112
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,650
Nobles are the key to the door of Scotland.

113
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,490
Grant our nobles lands in the North.

114
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,740
Give their nobles estates here in England.

115
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,580
And make them too greedy to oppose us.

116
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,750
But, sir, our nobles
will be reluctant to uproot.

117
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,370
New lands mean new taxes and they're
already taxed for the war in France.

118
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,460
Are they?

119
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,340
Are they?

120
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,650
The trouble with Scotland...

121
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,650
...is that it's full of Scots.

122
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,830
Perhaps the time has come...

123
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,790
...to reinstitute an old custom.

124
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,460
Grant them "primae noctis".

125
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,250
First night.

126
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,760
When any common girl
inhabiting their lands is married...

127
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:41,970
...our nobles shall have sexual rights to her
on the night of her wedding.

128
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,270
If we can't get them out...

129
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,400
...we'll breed them out.

130
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:53,320
That should fetch just the kind
of lords we want to Scotland.

131
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,490
Taxes or no taxes, eh?

132
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,610
A most excellent idea, sire.

133
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,490
Is it?

134
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,830
<i>Now, in Edinburgh were gathered
the council of Scottish nobles.</i>

135
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,800
<i>Among these was Robert,
the 17th Earl of Bruce...</i>

136
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:19,010
<i>...a leading contender
for the crown of Scotland.</i>

137
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,640
I hear that Longshanks
has granted "primae noctis".

138
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:31,190
Clearly meant to draw
more of his supporters here.

139
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,070
My father believes we must lull
Longshanks into our confidence...

140
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,200
...by neither supporting his decree
nor opposing it.

141
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,200
- A wise plan.
- How is your father? He missed the council.

142
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:47,000
His affairs in France keep him long overdue.

143
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,210
But he sends his greetings.

144
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,380
And he says that I speak
for all of the Bruces...

145
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,260
...and for Scotland.

146
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,230
- You've dropped your rock.
- A test of manhood.

147
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,150
- You win.
- Ah-hah!

148
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,190
Call it a test of soldiery, then.

149
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,490
The English won't let us train with weapons,
so we train with stones.

150
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,370
The test of a soldier is not in his arm.
It's here.

151
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,950
No. It's here.

152
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:42,050
- Hamish?
- Mm-hm.

153
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,980
Here you go, son. Show him how.

154
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:59,060
- Come on, Hamish!
- Come on, boy!

155
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,690
Come on!

156
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,250
That's a good throw.

157
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,370
Aye. Aye, it was.

158
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,960
I was wondering
if you could do that when it matters.

159
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,050
As it... as it matters in battle.

160
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,800
Could you crush a man with that throw?

161
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,100
I could crush you... like a worm.

162
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,430
Oooh!

163
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,600
- You could?
- Aye.

164
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,230
Well, then, do it.

165
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,650
Would you like to see him
crush me like a worm?

166
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
- Come and do it.
- You'll move.

167
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:52,570
- I will not.
- Right.

168
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,200
He'll move.

169
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,200
Come on, Hamish!

170
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:00,290
Come on there, boy!

171
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,510
Well done!

172
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,440
A fine display, young Wallace.

173
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,900
Are you all right?
You look a wee bit shaky.

174
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,150
I should have remembered the rocks.

175
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,160
Aye, you should have.

176
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,160
Get up, you big heap of...

177
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:45,750
- It's good to see ye again.
- Aye, welcome home.

178
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,840
- Look what you did to my head.
- You should have moved.

179
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,770
William, will you dance with me?

180
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,650
Of course I will.

181
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,880
I've come to claim the right
of "primae noctis".

182
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:40,270
As lord of these lands, I will bless this
marriage by taking the bride into my bed...

183
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,930
...on the first night of her union.

184
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,100
By God you will not!

185
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,440
It is my noble right.

186
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,900
Good evening, sir.

187
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,860
Ah, young Wallace.
A grand soft evening, huh?

188
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,780
Aye, it's that.

189
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,370
Might I have a word with your daughter?

190
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,080
What do you want to have
a word with her about?

191
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,080
Well, erm...

192
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,410
Murron?

193
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,500
Would you like to ride with me this evening?

194
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:17,050
In this? You're out of your mind!

195
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,380
It's good Scottish weather, madam.
The rain is falling almost straight down.

196
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,140
- She cannae go with you.
- No?

197
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,680
No. No the now, anyway.

198
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,430
- No the now.
- No the now.

199
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,350
- We'll see ye later.
- The weather's fine. It's hardly raining.

200
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,940
Did you no hear what I said?

201
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,820
- Murron!
- Murron!

202
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,370
It's you she takes after.

203
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,440
How did you know me after so long?

204
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,980
I didn't.

205
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,320
I saw you staring at me
and I didn't know who you were.

206
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:22,150
I'm sorry. I suppose I was.

207
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,160
Are you in the habit of riding off
in the rain with strangers?

208
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:31,040
It was the best way to make you leave.

209
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,540
If I ever find the courage to ask ye again,
I'll warn you in writing first.

210
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:39,300
- It wouldn't help. I can't read.
- Can ye not?

211
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,470
No.

212
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,640
Well, that's something
we shall have to remedy.

213
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:48,260
- You're gonna teach me to read?
- If you like.

214
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,720
Aye.

215
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,770
In what language?

216
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,980
You're showing off now.

217
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,650
- That's right. Are you impressed yet?
- No. Should I be?

218
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,030
Do that standing on your head,
and I'll be impressed.

219
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,250
- My kilt'll fly up, but I'll try...

220
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,710
You learnt no manners on your travels!

221
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,040
The French and the Romans
are worse than I.

222
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,920
- You went to Rome?
- Aye. Uncle took me on a pilgrimage.

223
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,170
What was it like?

224
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,720
What does that mean?

225
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,680
Beautiful.

226
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,980
But I belong here.

227
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,350
Murron!

228
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,220
Come in now!

229
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:27,460
Sir, I know it was strange of me
to invite Murron to ride last night, but...

230
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,010
MacClannough's daughter is another matter.

231
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,510
- I've come to fetch you to a meeting.
- What kind of meeting?

232
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:39,640
- The secret kind.
- Your meetings are a waste of time.

233
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,060
Your father was a fighter...

234
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:45,940
...and a patriot.

235
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,110
I know who my father was.

236
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,200
I came home to raise crops
and, God willing, a family.

237
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:57,120
If I can live in peace, I will.

238
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,580
Go on!

239
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,370
- You want to stay out of the troubles?
- Aye.

240
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,670
If you can prove it,
you may court my daughter.

241
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,840
Until you prove it, the answer is no.

242
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,550
- No.
- No, Wallace. No.

243
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,630
Didn't I just prove it?

244
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,840
No!

245
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:16,720
- No?
- No!

246
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,760
Of course, running a farm is a lot of work.

247
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,140
But that will all change when my sons arrive.

248
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:05,350
So, you've got children.

249
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,320
Well, not yet. But I was hoping
that you could help me with that.

250
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,900
So you want me to marry you, then?

251
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,530
Well, it's a bit sudden, but all right.

252
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,280
Is that what you call a proposal?

253
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,910
I love you. Always have.

254
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:27,000
I want to marry you.

255
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,970
Is that a yes?

256
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,810
- Aye, that's a yes.
- Yeah?

257
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,060
- We'd best hurry. He'll be waiting.
- Oh, wait.

258
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,980
Where are you going?

259
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:38,610
- What's that?
- You'll see.

260
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,890
Father.

261
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,860
I will love you my whole life.

262
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,740
You and no other.

263
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,910
And I you.

264
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,040
You and no other... for ever.

265
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:38,920
<i>In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti...</i>

266
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:56,250
When will I see ye again? Tonight?

267
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,580
- I can't.
- Why not?

268
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,420
My dad's growing suspicious.

269
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:03,300
Would that have anything to do with...

270
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,760
When?

271
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:08,430
When?

272
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,300
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

273
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,690
Look lively, Sergeant.

274
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,450
What are you carrying, lassie?

275
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,660
- That looks heavy. Can we help you?
- That's fine.

276
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:39,790
I'm not going to steal it...

277
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,960
Ohh! You remind me
of my daughter back home.

278
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,770
Hello, lassie.

279
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,950
Ssh.

280
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,460
Keep quiet, Smythe.

281
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:26,090
Aagh! Bitch!

282
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,050
You bitch!

283
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:46,440
Are you all right?

284
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,450
- Are you all right?
- Aye.

285
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:04,210
- Can you ride?
- Aye.

286
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:10,550
Come back here, you bastard!

287
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,340
Ring the alarm! Help!

288
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,510
Meet me at the grove.

289
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,470
- Ride!
- They're getting away!

290
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:05,480
All right, you bitch!

291
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,420
Murron!

292
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:39,220
Murron!

293
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,440
All of you know full well
the great pains I've always taken...

294
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:56,150
...never to be too strict, too rigid,
with the application of our laws.

295
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,860
And, as a consequence...

296
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:02,080
...have we not learned to live together...

297
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,740
...in relative peace and harmony?

298
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,420
Huh?

299
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:17,970
And this... day's lawlessness
is how you repay my leniency.

300
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:29,190
Well, you leave me with little choice.

301
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:39,030
An assault on the King's soldiers...

302
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,990
...is the same as an assault
on the King himself.

303
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,760
Now...

304
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:05,390
...let this scrapper come to me.

305
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:02,820
There.

306
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,610
Aaagh!

307
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,180
Aaagh!

308
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:31,820
Corporal! Some archers on the tower! Now!

309
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,960
- Hold still, Father.

310
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:47,050
You idiot, boy!

311
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:07,520
Aaagh!

312
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,550
- Father, are you all right?
- Aye.

313
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,920
MacCaulich.

314
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:41,140
MacCaulich.

315
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:43,260
MacCaulich!

316
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:47,640
MacCaulich! MacCaulich!

317
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:51,480
MacCaulich!

318
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,230
Wallace! Wallace!

319
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:05,410
<i>Anima eius
et animae omnium fidelium defunctorum...</i>

320
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,580
<i>...per misericordiam Dei...</i>

321
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:11,040
<i>...requiescant in pace.</i>

322
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:14,130
<i>In nomine Patris, et Filii...</i>

323
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,170
<i>...et Spiritus Sanctus.</i>

324
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:20,760
- Amen.
- Amen.

325
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:19,500
What are you waiting for, boy?

326
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:24,340
Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down.

327
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,140
Here. You can do it. I'll hold him down.

328
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:30,310
Pour it straight in the wound, boy.

329
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,310
I know it seems like
a waste of good whisky. Indulge me.

330
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,110
Hold him! Hold him! Hold him. Now...

331
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,780
...let him go.

332
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:48,820
All right?

333
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:51,660
That'll wake you up in the morning, boy.

334
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:56,080
- There's somebody coming!
- Arm yourselves!

335
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:03,670
There's somebody coming.

336
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,970
MacGregors! From the next glen.

337
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:14,640
We heard about what was happening.

338
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:19,190
We don't want you "amerdans"
thinking you can have your fun without us.

339
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,690
Go home.

340
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,490
Some of us are in this.

341
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,610
I can't help that now.

342
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:30,820
But you can help yourselves. Go home.

343
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:36,830
We'll have no homes left when the English
garrison comes through and burns us out.

344
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:40,750
- And they will.
- Aye.

345
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,590
Welcome.

346
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:16,950
Patrol returning, my Lord.

347
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,190
So, what news?

348
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:00,750
I have dispatched 100 soldiers to Lanark.
They will be returning now!

349
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,710
Were they dressed like this?

350
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,420
Actually, it was more like 50.

351
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:10,510
Make it quick.

352
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,390
Do you remember me?

353
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:17,140
I never did her any harm. It was my right!

354
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:20,310
Your right.
I'm here to claim the right of a husband!

355
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:32,200
I'm William Wallace.

356
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,030
And the rest of you will be spared.

357
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,700
Go back to England!

358
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,870
And tell them there...

359
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:44,710
...that Scotland's daughters and her sons
are yours no more.

360
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,590
Tell them Scotland is free.

361
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:55,680
Burn it.

362
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:32,960
The Scottish rebels
have routed one of my garrisons...

363
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,430
...and murdered the noble Lord.

364
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:39,140
I heard.
This Wallace is a brigand, nothing more.

365
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:42,720
And how would you deal with this... brigand?

366
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:48,650
Like any common thief. Have the local
magistrate arrest and punish him.

367
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:53,320
Leave us.

368
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:07,870
Wallace has already killed the magistrate
and taken control of the town.

369
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,290
Stand up.

370
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,130
Stand up!

371
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,170
In the morning...

372
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:18,800
...I depart for France to press our rights there.

373
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,930
And I leave you here
to quell this little rebellion.

374
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:26,640
Understood? Is it?

375
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:31,900
One day you will be a king.

376
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:35,820
At least try to act like one.

377
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,910
Get away from me!

378
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:45,120
Convene my military council!

379
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:27,580
There!

380
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:31,290
After them!

381
01:02:56,650 --> 01:03:00,070
No point resisting.
You're outnumbered and trapped.

382
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:05,240
Where are the rest of you? Where's Wallace?

383
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,920
- Father.
- Ah, come in. Come in.

384
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,800
A rebellion has begun.

385
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,810
Under whom?

386
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:34,860
A commoner... named William Wallace.

387
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:46,280
You will embrace this rebellion.

388
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:49,200
Support it from our lands in the North.

389
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:53,710
I will gain English favor by condemning it...

390
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:59,000
...and ordering it opposed
from our lands in the South.

391
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:03,550
Sit down. Stay awhile.

392
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:11,980
This Wallace...

393
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:13,730
He doesn't even have a knighthood.

394
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,310
But he fights with passion.

395
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,440
And he inspires!

396
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:23,320
And you wish to charge off
and fight as he did, eh?

397
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,280
- So would I.
- Well, maybe it's time.

398
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:29,700
It is time... to survive.

399
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:32,830
You're the 17th Robert Bruce.

400
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:40,500
The 16 before you passed you land and title
because they "didn't" charge in.

401
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,130
- Call a meeting of the nobles.
- They do nothing but talk.

402
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:49,180
Rightly so! They're as rich in English titles
and lands as they are in Scottish, as we are.

403
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:52,640
You admire this man... this William Wallace.

404
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:55,390
Uncompromising men are easier to admire.

405
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,850
He has courage. So does a dog.

406
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:03,490
But it is exactly the ability to compromise
that makes a man noble.

407
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:05,570
And understand this:

408
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:09,990
Edward Longshanks is the most ruthless king
ever to sit on the throne of England.

409
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,410
And none of us...

410
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:15,620
...and nothing of Scotland will remain...

411
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:19,080
...unless "we" are as ruthless.

412
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:21,670
Give ear to our nobles.

413
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,550
Knowing their minds...

414
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,430
...is the key to the throne.

415
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:45,820
Wait. Wait! Look.

416
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:48,660
This is out, and this is left.

417
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:50,570
Carry on.

418
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:54,410
Carry on!

419
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:35,510
You know...

420
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,930
...eventually Longshanks
will send in his northern army.

421
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:43,940
Heavy cavalry. Armoured horse.
Shake the very ground.

422
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:46,150
He'll ride right over us.

423
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,860
Uncle Argyle used to talk about it.

424
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:51,990
How no army had ever stood up
to a charge of heavy horse.

425
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:57,080
- So what do we do?
- Hit. Run. Hide. The Highland way.

426
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:06,840
Or make spears.

427
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:11,840
Hundreds of 'em.
Long spears. Twice as long as a man.

428
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:14,930
- That long?
- Aye.

429
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,180
Some men are longer than others.

430
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:21,730
Your mother been telling you
stories about me again, eh?

431
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:25,690
Volunteers coming in!

432
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:30,610
William Wallace.
We've come to fight and to die for you.

433
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:34,490
Stand up, man. I'm not the Pope.

434
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:37,280
My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.

435
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:40,330
- I brought you this...
- We checked them for arms.

436
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:42,870
I brought you this.

437
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,040
My wife made it for you.

438
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:47,330
Ah, thank you.

439
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:53,840
Him! That can't be William Wallace.

440
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:57,680
I'm prettier than this man.

441
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,470
All right, Father.

442
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,640
I'll ask him.

443
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,810
If I risk my neck for you...

444
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,980
...will I get to kill Englishmen?

445
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:13,490
Is your father a ghost
or do you converse with the Almighty?

446
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:16,820
To find his equal,
an Irishman is forced to talk to God.

447
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:18,370
Yes, Father!

448
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,950
The Almighty says,
"Just answer the fucking question!"

449
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:25,790
- Mind your tongue.
- Insane Irish!

450
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:32,380
Smart enough to get a dagger
past your guards, old man.

451
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:34,460
That's my friend, Irishman.

452
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:39,930
And the answer to your question is yes.
Fight for me, you get to kill the English.

453
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,260
Excellent!

454
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:44,430
Stephen is my name.

455
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,890
I'm the most wanted man on my island.

456
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:49,440
Except I'm not on my island, of course.

457
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:51,980
- More's the pity.
- Your island?

458
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:56,780
- You mean Ireland?
- Yeah. It's mine.

459
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:02,410
You're a madman.

460
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,920
I've come to the right place, then.

461
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:35,340
Sure, didn't the Almighty
send me to watch your back?

462
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:39,970
I didn't like him anyway.

463
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:44,720
He wasn't right in the head.

464
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:00,740
William! It's our runners!

465
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:13,960
The English... are advancing
an army towards Stirling!

466
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:18,380
- Do the nobles rally?
- Robert the Bruce and others will not fight.

467
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:22,050
But word has spread. The Highlanders
are coming down on their own.

468
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,390
Aye... In droves of hundreds...
and thousands!

469
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,600
Are you ready for a war?!

470
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:46,660
- What news?
- We're outnumbered, at least three to one.

471
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:49,080
- How many horse, then?
- 300, maybe more.

472
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:52,120
- 300 heavy horse!
- We must "try" to negotiate.

473
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:55,960
Who was in command?
Did he have a scarlet chevron?

474
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:58,500
- Aye, he did.
- That'll be Cheltham.

475
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:02,420
We could still negotiate...

476
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,840
What are they talking about?

477
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:09,550
I cannae hear, but it doesnae look good.

478
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:11,720
The nobles will negotiate.

479
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:15,060
They do a deal... and we go home.

480
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:17,690
If not... we charge.

481
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:21,230
300 heavy horse! We've no chance!

482
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:22,590
So many.

483
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:29,090
I didn't come here to fight
so they could own more lands.

484
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,300
Then I'd have to work for them.

485
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,470
Nor me.

486
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,430
All right, lads!

487
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,930
I'm not dying for these bastards!

488
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:40,650
Let's go home!

489
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,830
Stop, men!

490
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:05,670
Do not flee! Wait until we've negotiated!

491
01:15:56,430 --> 01:15:58,350
William Wallace!

492
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,190
Can't be. Not tall enough.

493
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:26,040
The Almighty says this is a fashionable fight.
It's drawn the finest people.

494
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:31,550
- Where is thy salute?
- For coming to this battlefield, I thank you.

495
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,720
This is our army.
To join it, you give homage.

496
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:37,220
I give homage to Scotland.

497
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:40,890
And if this is your army...

498
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:42,520
...why does it go?

499
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:44,940
We didn't come here to fight for them!

500
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:53,150
Home! The English are too many!

501
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:02,830
Sons of Scotland!

502
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:05,040
I am William Wallace!

503
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:09,420
- William Wallace is seven feet tall.
- Yes, I've heard.

504
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:11,590
He kills men by the hundred.

505
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,970
And if he were here, he'd consume
the English with fireballs from his eyes...

506
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:18,140
...and lightning from his arse!

507
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:25,230
I "am" William Wallace!

508
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,440
And I see...

509
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:30,320
...a whole army of my countrymen...

510
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:34,440
...here in defiance of tyranny.

511
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:40,330
You've come to fight as free men...

512
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:44,580
...and free men you are!

513
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:49,290
What will you do without freedom?

514
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,460
Will you fight?

515
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:57,880
Against that? No!

516
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:01,100
We will run, and we will live.

517
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:04,560
Aye. Fight and you may die.

518
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:07,020
Run, and you'll live.

519
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:10,940
At least a while.

520
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:15,940
And dying in your beds,
many years from now...

521
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:19,610
...would you be willing to trade...

522
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:22,580
...all the days from this day to that...

523
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:25,290
...for one chance, just one chance...

524
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:28,250
...to come back here and tell our enemies...

525
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,540
...that they may take our lives...

526
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:36,590
...but they'll never take our freedom!

527
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:40,430
<i>Alba qu bra!</i>

528
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:44,060
<i>Alba qu bra!</i>

529
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:05,120
They seem quite optimistic.
Maybe they do want to fight.

530
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:08,120
Confrontation might be
a foregone conclusion.

531
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:12,420
But nonetheless...
I think we should deliver the King's terms.

532
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:15,090
The King's terms?
They'll never live up to them.

533
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:17,550
My Lord, I think...

534
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:21,470
All right! Offer them the terms.

535
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:27,310
- They're coming out. Should we go to them?
- Let me do the talking. Agreed?

536
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:30,310
Aye.

537
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:36,320
Fine speech.

538
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:38,740
Now what do we do?

539
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:40,900
Just be yourselves.

540
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:43,070
Where are you going?

541
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,950
I'm going to pick a fight.

542
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:57,380
Well... we didn't get dressed up for nothing.

543
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:02,130
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

544
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,510
Here are the King's terms.

545
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:12,810
Lead this army off the field...

546
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:19,070
...and he will give you each
estates in Yorkshire...

547
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:24,280
...including hereditary title,
from which you will pay...

548
01:20:24,530 --> 01:20:27,160
- From which you will pay...
- I have an offer for ye.

549
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:30,830
Cheltham, this is William Wallace.

550
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:34,040
From which you will pay the King
an annual duty...

551
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:37,420
- I said I have an offer for "you".
- You disrespect a banner of truce!

552
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:40,300
From his King? Absolutely.

553
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:43,010
Here are Scotland's terms.

554
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:46,510
Lower your flags...
and march straight back to England.

555
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:52,850
At every home you pass, beg forgiveness
for 100 years of theft, rape and murder.

556
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:55,190
Do that, and your men shall live.

557
01:20:55,440 --> 01:21:00,860
Do it not...
and every one of you will die today.

558
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:09,780
You are outmatched.
You have no heavy cavalry.

559
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,660
In two centuries, no army has won without...

560
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:16,460
I'm not finished!

561
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:18,420
Before we let you leave...

562
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:23,550
...your commander must cross that field,
present himself before this army...

563
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:28,850
...put his head between his legs...
and kiss his own arse.

564
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:41,070
I'd say that was rather less cordial
than he was used to.

565
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:44,490
You be ready and do exactly as I say.
On my signal...

566
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:47,660
...ride round behind our position,
and flank them.

567
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:52,200
- We must not divide our forces.
- Do it... and let the English see you do it.

568
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:54,120
They'll think we run away?

569
01:21:54,370 --> 01:21:58,170
Take out their archers.
I'll meet you in the middle.

570
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:02,050
Right. Come on.

571
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:20,440
<i>Ego vos absolvo...</i>

572
01:22:20,690 --> 01:22:24,650
<i>...ab omnibus peccatis vestris.
In nomine Patris...</i>

573
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:29,410
Insolent bastard!
I want this Wallace's heart on a plate!

574
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:30,990
Archers!

575
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:44,380
Archers forward!

576
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:42,350
You bastards!

577
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:39,080
The Lord tells me
He can get me out of this mess...

578
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:43,210
...but He's pretty sure you're fucked.

579
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:06,230
Ready... Loose!

580
01:25:22,910 --> 01:25:25,960
Ride!

581
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:30,920
See? Every Scot with a horse is fleeing.

582
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:36,090
Our cavalry will ride them down like grass.
Send the horse.

583
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:39,600
Full attack.

584
01:26:52,630 --> 01:26:55,340
Steady...

585
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:58,470
Hold!

586
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:02,100
Hold!

587
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:07,930
Hold!

588
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:14,320
Hold!

589
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:28,330
Now!

590
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:14,580
- Send the infantry.
- My Lord...

591
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:17,590
You lead them!

592
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:33,190
Charge!

593
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:38,560
Retreat!

594
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:14,560
Bastard!

595
01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:18,560
Come on!

596
01:31:56,850 --> 01:32:00,480
All right.

597
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:31,510
Wallace!

598
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:40,020
Wallace! Wallace!

599
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,840
I knight thee...

600
01:33:13,090 --> 01:33:16,720
...Sir William Wallace.

601
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:21,220
Sir William, in the name of God...

602
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:24,690
...we appoint thee guardian
and high protector of Scotland...

603
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:27,480
...and thy captains as aides-de-camp.

604
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:30,900
Stand and be recognized.

605
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,960
Does anyone know his politics?

606
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:47,540
No, but his weight with the commoners
could upset everything.

607
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:52,800
The Balliols will kiss his arse,
and so we must.

608
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:02,720
Sir William!

609
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:07,230
Sir William.

610
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:10,860
Inasmuch as you and your captains
hail from a region...

611
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:14,030
...long known to support the Balliol clan...

612
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:19,200
...may we invite you to continue your support
and uphold our rightful claim?

613
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:23,250
Damn the Balliol clan!
They're all Longshanks's men!

614
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:27,790
Gentlemen.

615
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:30,170
- Gentlemen!
- It's time to declare a king.

616
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:34,460
Halt! Wait! Are you prepared
to recognize "our" legitimate succession?

617
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:38,300
- You won't support the claim.
- Those were lies, written by you.

618
01:34:38,550 --> 01:34:40,600
- Oh, no.

619
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:46,940
- I demand recognition of these documents!
- These were lies when you wrote them!

620
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:50,810
Please, gentlemen!

621
01:34:51,610 --> 01:34:55,820
Quiet! Sir William! Where are you going?

622
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:58,280
We have beaten the English.

623
01:34:58,530 --> 01:35:00,450
But they'll come back...

624
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:02,530
...because you won't stand together.

625
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:04,870
What will you do?

626
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:10,080
I will invade England...
and defeat the English on their own ground.

627
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:14,380
Invade? That's impossible.

628
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:17,130
Why? Why is that impossible?

629
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:21,640
You're so concerned with squabbling
for scraps from Longshanks's table...

630
01:35:21,890 --> 01:35:26,980
...that you've missed
your God-given right to something better.

631
01:35:27,230 --> 01:35:29,140
There's a difference between us.

632
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:34,070
You think the people of Scotland exist
to provide you with position.

633
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:39,150
I think your position exists
to provide those people with freedom.

634
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:43,620
And I go to make sure that they have it.

635
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:58,920
Wait!

636
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:01,220
I respect what you said.

637
01:36:01,470 --> 01:36:04,970
But remember that these men
have lands and castles.

638
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:06,970
It's much to risk.

639
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:12,520
And the common man that bleeds
in battle, does he risk less?

640
01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:16,980
No.

641
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:20,740
But from top to bottom,
this country has got no sense of itself.

642
01:36:20,990 --> 01:36:24,070
Its nobles share allegiance with England.

643
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:28,160
- Its clans war with each other.
- Aye.

644
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:32,500
If you make enemies on both sides
of the border... you'll end up dead.

645
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:35,210
We all will. It's just
a question of how and why.

646
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:37,630
I'm not a coward. I want what you want.

647
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,510
But we need the nobles.

648
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:43,010
- We need 'em?
- Aye.

649
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:45,850
Now, tell me.
What does that mean, to be noble?

650
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:50,850
Your title gives you claim to Scotland's
throne, but men don't follow titles.

651
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:52,850
They follow courage.

652
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:54,980
Now, our people know you.

653
01:36:55,230 --> 01:36:57,270
Noble and common, they respect you.

654
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:02,030
And if you would just lead them to freedom...

655
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:06,070
...they'd follow you.

656
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:10,950
And so would I.

657
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:34,940
Damn it! My sodomite cousin the Prince
tells me he has no troops to lend.

658
01:37:35,190 --> 01:37:39,150
And every town in northern England
is begging for help.

659
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:41,110
He advances!

660
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:44,570
- To which town?
- To here, my Lord.

661
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:49,200
Bring the provisions inside,
double the guards, seal the gate. Now!

662
01:37:49,450 --> 01:37:54,370
Quickly! Bring in the provisions!

663
01:38:22,030 --> 01:38:24,570
Sir, we can get you out if you leave now.

664
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:29,830
I will not tell my uncle I've lost him
the greatest city in the North.

665
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:12,620
Come on!

666
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:49,400
Make way for the King!

667
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,910
It's not your fault.

668
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:04,840
- Stand up to him!
- I will stand up to him and more.

669
01:40:40,370 --> 01:40:43,960
What news of the North?

670
01:40:44,630 --> 01:40:49,170
Nothing new, Your Majesty.
We've sent riders to speed any word.

671
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:53,890
I heard the word in France where I was
fighting to expand your future kingdom.

672
01:40:54,140 --> 01:41:01,730
The word, my son, is that
our entire northern army is annihilated.

673
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:04,060
And you have done nothing.

674
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:09,940
I... I have ordered conscription, sir,
assembled and ready to depart.

675
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:14,660
Excuse me, sire, but there's
a very urgent message from York.

676
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:18,490
Come.

677
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:27,750
- Leave us.
- Thank you, sire.

678
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:31,590
Erm... W... Wallace has sacked York.

679
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:32,800
What?

680
01:41:33,050 --> 01:41:36,680
Wallace has sacked York.

681
01:41:38,180 --> 01:41:39,810
Uh!

682
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:43,690
Oh!

683
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:53,990
Sire... thy own nephew!

684
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:58,580
What beast could do such a thing!

685
01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:02,410
If he can sack York...

686
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:04,830
...he can invade Lower England.

687
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:08,340
We will stop him!

688
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:15,630
Who is this person who speaks to me
as though I needed his advice?

689
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:18,470
I have declared Phillip my High Counsellor.

690
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:20,890
Is he qualified?

691
01:42:21,140 --> 01:42:25,520
I am skilled in the arts of war
and military tactics, sire.

692
01:42:25,770 --> 01:42:27,480
Are you?

693
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:29,270
Tell me...

694
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:34,650
What advice would you offer
on the, er, present... situation?

695
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:38,700
Aaaagh!

696
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:09,560
I shall offer a truce...

697
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:13,280
...and buy him off.

698
01:43:13,610 --> 01:43:16,990
But who will go to him? Not I.

699
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:20,450
If I fell under the sword of that murderer...

700
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:23,950
...it might be "my" head in a basket.

701
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:28,080
And not... my gentle son.

702
01:43:28,330 --> 01:43:32,960
The mere sight of him would only encourage
an enemy to take over the whole country.

703
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:40,090
So whom do I send?

704
01:43:43,100 --> 01:43:45,890
Whom do I send?

705
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:09,060
I'm dreaming.

706
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:12,310
Yes, you are.

707
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:16,190
And you must wake.

708
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:27,410
I don't want to wake.

709
01:45:27,660 --> 01:45:30,750
I want to stay here with you.

710
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,920
And I with you.

711
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:36,840
But you must wake now.

712
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:40,220
Wake up, William.

713
01:45:40,470 --> 01:45:43,840
Wake up.

714
01:45:44,970 --> 01:45:47,510
William, wake up...

715
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:50,680
William! A royal entourage comes...

716
01:45:50,930 --> 01:45:52,850
...flying banners of truce...

717
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:57,320
...and the standards of Longshanks himself!

718
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:40,780
I am the Princess of Wales.

719
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:44,400
I come as the King's servant
and with his authority.

720
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:47,450
To do what?

721
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:51,330
To discuss the King's proposals.

722
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:55,790
Will you speak with a woman?

723
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:17,520
I understand you have recently
been given the rank of knight.

724
01:47:17,770 --> 01:47:19,690
I have been given nothing.

725
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:22,730
God makes men what they are.

726
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:25,650
Did God make you
the sacker of peaceful cities?

727
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:30,410
The executioner of the King's nephew,
my husband's own cousin?

728
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:34,700
York was the staging point
for every invasion of my country.

729
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:41,340
That cousin hanged innocent Scots, even
women and children, from the city walls.

730
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:48,430
Longshanks did far worse
the last time he took a Scottish city.

731
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:12,490
You ask your King...
to his face. Ask him.

732
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:18,210
See if his eyes can convince you of the truth.

733
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:29,090
Hamilton... Leave us.

734
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:33,640
- My Lady?
- Leave us! Now.

735
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:45,650
Let us talk plainly.

736
01:48:45,860 --> 01:48:47,820
You invade England.

737
01:48:48,070 --> 01:48:53,030
But you cannot complete the conquest
so far from your shelter and supply.

738
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:56,080
The King desires peace.

739
01:48:56,330 --> 01:48:58,200
Longshanks desires peace?

740
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:00,420
He declares it to me, I swear it.

741
01:49:00,670 --> 01:49:03,460
He proposes that you withdraw your attack.

742
01:49:03,710 --> 01:49:07,130
In return he grants you title,
estates and this chest of gold...

743
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:10,220
...which I am to pay to you personally.

744
01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:14,760
A lordship and titles, gold...
that I should become Judas.

745
01:49:15,010 --> 01:49:16,970
Peace is made in such ways.

746
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:20,560
Slaves are made in such ways!

747
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:25,440
The last time Longshanks spoke of peace,
I was a boy.

748
01:49:25,690 --> 01:49:28,190
And many Scottish nobles
who would not be slaves...

749
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:31,490
...were lured by him,
under a flag of truce, to a barn...

750
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:35,330
...where he had them hanged.

751
01:49:35,370 --> 01:49:37,330
I was very young.

752
01:49:37,580 --> 01:49:42,000
But I remember
Longshanks's notion of peace.

753
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:47,880
I understand you have suffered.

754
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:52,880
I know... about your woman.

755
01:50:02,310 --> 01:50:05,900
She was my wife.

756
01:50:06,860 --> 01:50:11,990
We married in secret because I would
not share her with an English lord.

757
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:15,700
They killed her... to get to me.

758
01:50:20,830 --> 01:50:24,420
I've never spoken of it.

759
01:50:24,580 --> 01:50:28,880
I don't know why I tell you now, except...

760
01:50:30,050 --> 01:50:33,680
...I see her strength in you.

761
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:39,850
One day...

762
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:42,560
...you'll be a queen.

763
01:50:42,810 --> 01:50:46,440
And you must open your eyes.

764
01:50:52,690 --> 01:50:54,650
You tell your King...

765
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:57,530
...that William Wallace will not be ruled...

766
01:50:57,780 --> 01:51:01,790
...and nor will any Scot while I live.

767
01:51:33,650 --> 01:51:37,950
Ah! My son's loyal wife returns
unkilled by the heathen.

768
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:40,080
So he accepted our bribe?

769
01:51:40,330 --> 01:51:43,950
No. He did not.

770
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:46,000
Then why does he stay?

771
01:51:46,250 --> 01:51:48,960
My scouts tell me that he has not advanced.

772
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:51,130
He waits for you at York.

773
01:51:51,380 --> 01:51:53,510
He says he will attack no more towns...

774
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:56,260
...if you are man enough
to come and face him.

775
01:51:56,510 --> 01:51:59,050
Did he?

776
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:03,220
The Welsh bowmen will not be detected...

777
01:52:03,470 --> 01:52:08,520
...arriving so far around his flank.

778
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:11,560
The main force of our armies
from France land here...

779
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:13,820
...to the north of Edinburgh.

780
01:52:14,070 --> 01:52:18,240
Conscripts from Ireland
approach from the southwest...

781
01:52:18,490 --> 01:52:19,910
...to here.

782
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:23,580
Welsh bowmen, troops from France,
Irish conscripts.

783
01:52:23,790 --> 01:52:26,370
But they'd take weeks to assemble.

784
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:28,540
I dispatched them...

785
01:52:28,790 --> 01:52:32,540
...before I sent your wife.

786
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:37,470
So our little ruse succeeded.

787
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:39,630
Thank you.

788
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:43,970
And while this upstart
awaits my arrival in York...

789
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:49,100
...my forces will have arrived
in Edinburgh, behind him.

790
01:52:49,350 --> 01:52:52,900
You spoke with this, er...

791
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:55,780
...Wallace in private?

792
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:59,030
Tell me...

793
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:02,450
What kind of man is he?

794
01:53:02,700 --> 01:53:06,040
A mindless barbarian.

795
01:53:06,290 --> 01:53:09,910
Not a king like you, my Lord.

796
01:53:10,830 --> 01:53:13,170
You may return to your embroidery.

797
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:15,340
Humbly, my Lord.

798
01:53:15,590 --> 01:53:19,760
You brought back the money, of course?

799
01:53:22,050 --> 01:53:26,680
No. I gave it to ease the suffering
of the children of this war.

800
01:53:29,350 --> 01:53:33,310
That's what happens
when you send a woman.

801
01:53:33,690 --> 01:53:38,780
Forgive me, sire. I thought that generosity
might demonstrate your greatness...

802
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:40,950
...to those you mean to rule.

803
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,200
My greatness...

804
01:53:46,450 --> 01:53:50,370
...will be better demonstrated
when Wallace returns to Scotland...

805
01:53:50,620 --> 01:53:53,000
...and finds his country in ashes.

806
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:59,760
William!

807
01:54:00,010 --> 01:54:03,800
There's riders approaching.

808
01:54:09,100 --> 01:54:11,980
A personal escort of the Princess.

809
01:54:12,230 --> 01:54:14,310
Aye.

810
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:16,560
Must have made an impression.

811
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:17,940
Aye.

812
01:54:18,190 --> 01:54:22,280
I didn't think you were in the tent that long.

813
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:27,660
<i>Mademoiselle.</i>

814
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:30,790
<i>Un message de ma maîtresse.</i>

815
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:34,620
<i>Merci.</i>

816
01:54:56,650 --> 01:54:59,730
It's true! The English ships
are moving up from the South.

817
01:54:59,980 --> 01:55:03,150
I don't know about the Welsh yet,
but the Irish have landed.

818
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:05,530
I had to see it myself to believe it.

819
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:08,410
What are the Irish doing
fighting with the English?

820
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:12,290
I wouldn't worry about them.
Didn't I tell you before?

821
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:14,410
It's "my" island.

822
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:18,750
Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburgh
and assemble the council. Order it!

823
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,380
Right. Come on!

824
01:55:21,630 --> 01:55:23,920
Ya!

825
01:55:24,170 --> 01:55:28,640
- Your island?
- My island! Yup!

826
01:55:28,890 --> 01:55:31,350
- We'll have to negotiate.
- Please, gentlemen!

827
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:33,850
Lords, Craig is right!

828
01:55:34,100 --> 01:55:37,020
This time our only option is to negotiate.

829
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:41,400
Unless you want to see Edinburgh razed...

830
01:55:46,820 --> 01:55:50,200
My army has marched
for more days than I can remember.

831
01:55:50,450 --> 01:55:52,580
And we still have preparations to make...

832
01:55:52,830 --> 01:55:55,580
...so I'll make this plain.

833
01:55:55,830 --> 01:55:58,420
We require every soldier you can summon...

834
01:55:58,670 --> 01:56:01,380
...your personal escorts, even yourselves.

835
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:04,970
And we need them now.

836
01:56:05,090 --> 01:56:08,680
With such a force arrayed against us,
it's time to discuss other options.

837
01:56:08,930 --> 01:56:11,640
Other options?!

838
01:56:11,890 --> 01:56:15,180
Don't you wish at least
to lead your men onto the field...

839
01:56:15,430 --> 01:56:18,100
...and barter a better deal with Longshanks...

840
01:56:18,350 --> 01:56:20,690
...before you run?
- Sir William...

841
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:22,690
- We cannot defeat them!
- We can!

842
01:56:22,940 --> 01:56:26,820
- Sir William!
- And we will!

843
01:56:27,610 --> 01:56:32,120
We won at Stirling, and still you quibble!

844
01:56:32,580 --> 01:56:35,160
We won at York
and you would not support us.

845
01:56:35,410 --> 01:56:40,210
If you'll no stand up with us now,
I'd say you're cowards.

846
01:56:45,550 --> 01:56:46,970
If you are Scotsmen...

847
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:49,010
...I'm ashamed to call myself one.

848
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:53,310
Please, Sir William, speak with me alone.

849
01:56:54,220 --> 01:56:57,600
I beg you.

850
01:56:59,850 --> 01:57:01,860
You've achieved
more than anyone ever dreamed.

851
01:57:02,110 --> 01:57:05,400
But fighting these odds,
it looks like rage, not courage.

852
01:57:05,650 --> 01:57:09,280
It's well beyond rage.

853
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:12,740
Help me.

854
01:57:12,820 --> 01:57:16,870
In the name of Christ, help yourselves!

855
01:57:17,120 --> 01:57:19,000
Now is our chance! Now!

856
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:21,210
If we join, we can win. If we win...

857
01:57:21,460 --> 01:57:24,840
...we'll have what none of us
have ever had before.

858
01:57:25,090 --> 01:57:28,670
A country of our own.

859
01:57:29,170 --> 01:57:31,090
You're the rightful leader...

860
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:35,810
...and there is strength in you, I see it.

861
01:57:39,310 --> 01:57:43,060
Unite us.

862
01:57:43,980 --> 01:57:48,030
Unite us! Unite the clans!

863
01:57:53,620 --> 01:57:58,160
- All right!
- Right.

864
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:03,040
This cannot be the way.

865
01:58:03,290 --> 01:58:05,380
You said yourself...

866
01:58:05,630 --> 01:58:10,220
...the nobles will not support Wallace.

867
01:58:10,470 --> 01:58:15,300
So how does it help us
to join the side that is slaughtered?

868
01:58:15,550 --> 01:58:19,220
I gave him my word.

869
01:58:25,610 --> 01:58:27,520
I know it is hard.

870
01:58:27,770 --> 01:58:31,440
Being a leader is.

871
01:58:31,530 --> 01:58:33,450
My son...

872
01:58:33,700 --> 01:58:35,320
Son...

873
01:58:35,570 --> 01:58:38,660
Look at me.

874
01:58:44,330 --> 01:58:46,580
I cannot be King.

875
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:49,380
You and you alone can rule Scotland.

876
01:58:49,630 --> 01:58:52,470
What I tell you, you must do.

877
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:55,300
Not for me, not for yourself...

878
01:58:55,550 --> 01:58:59,180
...but for your country.

879
01:59:14,360 --> 01:59:18,200
Right, lads, make way. Coming through.

880
01:59:23,790 --> 01:59:27,460
Make way, lads.

881
01:59:31,090 --> 01:59:33,010
The Bruce is not coming, William.

882
01:59:33,260 --> 01:59:36,640
He'll come.

883
01:59:36,890 --> 01:59:40,600
Mornay and Lochlan have come.

884
01:59:40,810 --> 01:59:44,430
So will the Bruce.

885
01:59:45,350 --> 01:59:50,520
Quite a lovely... gathering.

886
01:59:50,770 --> 01:59:54,610
Wouldn't you agree?

887
01:59:54,820 --> 01:59:56,700
The archers are ready, sire.

888
01:59:56,950 --> 01:59:58,820
Not the archers.

889
01:59:59,070 --> 02:00:02,240
My scouts say their archers
are miles away and no threat.

890
02:00:02,490 --> 02:00:04,410
Arrows cost money.

891
02:00:04,660 --> 02:00:07,500
Use up the Irish. The dead cost nothing.

892
02:00:07,750 --> 02:00:10,000
And send in the infantry and cavalry.

893
02:00:10,250 --> 02:00:13,300
- Infantry!
- Infantry!

894
02:00:13,550 --> 02:00:15,720
- Cavalry!
- Cavalry!

895
02:00:15,970 --> 02:00:18,260
- Cavalry!
- Cavalry!

896
02:00:18,510 --> 02:00:23,310
- Advance!
- Advance!

897
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:50,600
Ah, good to see ye this morning!

898
02:01:50,730 --> 02:01:52,730
Irish!

899
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:54,980
Glad to have ye with us.

900
02:01:55,230 --> 02:01:58,860
Watch this.

901
02:04:06,610 --> 02:04:09,160
Mornay? Lochlan?

902
02:04:09,410 --> 02:04:12,160
I gave Mornay
double his lands in Scotland...

903
02:04:12,410 --> 02:04:14,250
...and matching estates in England.

904
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:17,790
Lochlan turned... for much less.

905
02:04:18,040 --> 02:04:19,960
Archers.

906
02:04:20,210 --> 02:04:24,420
I beg your pardon, sire?
Won't we hit our own troops?

907
02:04:24,670 --> 02:04:26,510
Yes.

908
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:28,640
But we'll hit theirs as well.

909
02:04:28,890 --> 02:04:31,470
We have reserves.

910
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:34,140
Attack!

911
02:04:34,390 --> 02:04:35,930
Archers!

912
02:04:36,180 --> 02:04:40,730
- Archers!
- Archers!

913
02:05:14,060 --> 02:05:16,560
Send in our reinforcements.

914
02:05:16,810 --> 02:05:21,060
- Send in the rest!

915
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:30,570
Bring me Wallace.

916
02:05:30,820 --> 02:05:32,700
Alive, if possible.

917
02:05:32,950 --> 02:05:35,660
Dead... just as good.

918
02:05:35,910 --> 02:05:37,830
Send us news of our victory.

919
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:41,710
Shall we retire?

920
02:06:45,020 --> 02:06:49,650
Ya! Ya!

921
02:07:05,330 --> 02:07:08,920
Protect the King.

922
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:19,390
Aaaagh!

923
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:51,500
Aagh! Aagh!

924
02:09:10,630 --> 02:09:15,090
Get up! Get up!

925
02:09:15,510 --> 02:09:18,550
Get up! Get up!

926
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:22,260
- Get him out of here!
- Jesus!

927
02:09:25,430 --> 02:09:28,230
Go!

928
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:32,310
Ya!

929
02:10:26,410 --> 02:10:30,080
I'm dying.

930
02:10:32,250 --> 02:10:35,540
Let me be.

931
02:10:39,340 --> 02:10:42,300
No.

932
02:10:42,550 --> 02:10:46,180
You're going to live.

933
02:10:46,350 --> 02:10:48,720
I've lived long enough to live free.

934
02:10:48,970 --> 02:10:51,730
Proud...

935
02:10:51,980 --> 02:10:56,060
...to see you become the man you are.

936
02:10:59,400 --> 02:11:02,990
I'm a happy man.

937
02:12:51,050 --> 02:12:53,060
I'm the one who's rotting.

938
02:12:53,310 --> 02:12:58,730
But I think your face looks graver than mine.

939
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:04,940
Son...

940
02:13:09,530 --> 02:13:13,290
We must have alliance
with England to prevail here.

941
02:13:13,540 --> 02:13:15,450
You achieved that.

942
02:13:15,700 --> 02:13:17,620
You saved your family...

943
02:13:17,870 --> 02:13:19,790
...and increased your land.

944
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:24,920
In time, you will have
all the power in Scotland.

945
02:13:25,170 --> 02:13:26,920
Lands.

946
02:13:27,170 --> 02:13:29,340
Titles. Men.

947
02:13:29,590 --> 02:13:31,140
Power. Nothing.

948
02:13:31,390 --> 02:13:35,390
- Nothing?
- I have nothing.

949
02:13:35,640 --> 02:13:39,560
Men fight for me because if they do not
I throw them off my land...

950
02:13:39,810 --> 02:13:43,440
...and I starve their wives and children.

951
02:13:43,690 --> 02:13:45,610
Those men...

952
02:13:45,860 --> 02:13:49,820
...who bled the ground red at Falkirk...

953
02:13:50,070 --> 02:13:53,240
They fought for William Wallace,
and he fights...

954
02:13:53,490 --> 02:13:57,080
...for something that I've never had.

955
02:13:58,330 --> 02:14:00,960
And I took it from him when I betrayed him...

956
02:14:01,210 --> 02:14:03,920
...and I saw it in his face
on the battlefield.

957
02:14:04,170 --> 02:14:06,840
And it's tearing me apart.

958
02:14:07,090 --> 02:14:10,220
Well, all men betray. All lose heart.

959
02:14:10,470 --> 02:14:14,720
I don't want to lose heart!

960
02:14:17,020 --> 02:14:19,180
I want to believe...

961
02:14:19,430 --> 02:14:23,060
...as he does.

962
02:14:27,570 --> 02:14:31,950
I will never be on the wrong side again.

963
02:15:13,780 --> 02:15:16,950
Aagh!

964
02:15:20,250 --> 02:15:23,790
No!

965
02:16:18,430 --> 02:16:21,510
Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay?

966
02:16:21,770 --> 02:16:23,680
Aye.

967
02:16:23,930 --> 02:16:26,600
Wallace rode into his bedchamber
and killed him.

968
02:16:26,850 --> 02:16:30,320
More of a liability now than ever he was.

969
02:16:30,570 --> 02:16:34,240
And there's no telling who'll be next.

970
02:16:34,490 --> 02:16:37,910
Maybe you.

971
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:42,740
Maybe me.

972
02:16:45,460 --> 02:16:48,420
It doesn't matter.

973
02:16:48,670 --> 02:16:50,540
I'm serious, Robert.

974
02:16:50,790 --> 02:16:53,880
So am I!

975
02:17:05,560 --> 02:17:07,270
Christ! Shit!

976
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:11,860
Search the place!

977
02:17:13,150 --> 02:17:16,990
Lochlan!

978
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:24,240
William Wallace killed 50 men.

979
02:17:24,490 --> 02:17:26,410
50 if it was one.

980
02:17:26,660 --> 02:17:29,040
100 men... with his own sword.

981
02:17:29,290 --> 02:17:31,080
Cut through them like...

982
02:17:31,330 --> 02:17:36,130
...Moses through the Red Sea.

983
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:09,040
His legend grows.

984
02:18:09,290 --> 02:18:11,920
It will be worse than before.

985
02:18:12,170 --> 02:18:14,710
He rallies new volunteers
in every Scottish town.

986
02:18:14,960 --> 02:18:16,880
When he replenishes his numbers...

987
02:18:17,130 --> 02:18:19,380
They're sheep! Mere sheep!

988
02:18:21,300 --> 02:18:24,640
Easily dispersed if we strike the shepherd.

989
02:18:24,890 --> 02:18:28,100
Very well.

990
02:18:28,140 --> 02:18:32,270
Pick a flock of your finest assassins
and set a meeting.

991
02:18:32,520 --> 02:18:37,980
My Lord, Wallace is renowned
for his ability to smell an ambush.

992
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:44,070
If what Lord Hamilton tells me is correct...

993
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:49,540
...he warmed to our future Queen
and would trust her.

994
02:18:49,580 --> 02:18:53,040
So we'll dispatch her
with the notion that she comes in peace.

995
02:18:53,290 --> 02:18:55,920
My Lord,
the Princess might be taken hostage...

996
02:18:56,170 --> 02:18:58,090
...or her life be put in jeopardy.

997
02:18:58,340 --> 02:19:03,220
My son would be most distressed by that.

998
02:19:03,470 --> 02:19:05,720
But in truth if she were to be killed...

999
02:19:05,970 --> 02:19:13,690
...we would soon find the King of France
a useful ally against the Scots.

1000
02:19:13,810 --> 02:19:15,730
You see...

1001
02:19:15,980 --> 02:19:22,610
As King, you must find
the good in any situation.

1002
02:19:47,930 --> 02:19:50,640
It's William Wallace, sure.

1003
02:19:50,890 --> 02:19:52,770
And he's given up his sword.

1004
02:19:53,020 --> 02:19:56,440
Be ready.

1005
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:22,300
Aagh!

1006
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:37,710
My Lady.

1007
02:21:39,620 --> 02:21:41,460
I received your message.

1008
02:21:54,600 --> 02:22:00,480
This is... the second time
you've warned me of danger.

1009
02:22:01,230 --> 02:22:02,480
Why?

1010
02:22:02,730 --> 02:22:06,440
There will be a new shipment
of supplies coming north next month.

1011
02:22:06,690 --> 02:22:08,570
Foods and weapons. They will...

1012
02:22:08,820 --> 02:22:12,120
No, stop.

1013
02:22:12,370 --> 02:22:15,950
Why do you help me?

1014
02:22:19,580 --> 02:22:23,290
Why do you help me?

1015
02:22:23,670 --> 02:22:27,960
Because of the way
you are looking at me now.

1016
02:24:18,620 --> 02:24:21,330
Just when we thought all hope was lost...

1017
02:24:21,580 --> 02:24:25,790
...our noble saviors have arrived.

1018
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:30,590
Off with their hoods.

1019
02:24:33,920 --> 02:24:36,590
Sir William, we come to seek a meeting.

1020
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:38,760
Well, what's the point?

1021
02:24:39,010 --> 02:24:41,640
You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks.

1022
02:24:41,890 --> 02:24:44,350
An oath to a liar is no oath at all.

1023
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:47,150
Every man of us is ready
to swear loyalty to you.

1024
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:49,310
So let the council swear publicly.

1025
02:24:49,560 --> 02:24:52,980
We cannot.
Some scarcely believe you're alive.

1026
02:24:53,230 --> 02:24:55,610
Others think you'll pay them Mornay's wages.

1027
02:24:55,860 --> 02:24:57,780
So we bid you to Edinburgh.

1028
02:24:58,030 --> 02:25:02,160
Meet us two days from now. Pledge us
your pardon and we'll unite behind you.

1029
02:25:02,410 --> 02:25:04,290
- Scotland will be one.
- One?

1030
02:25:04,540 --> 02:25:08,580
- You mean us and you.
- No.

1031
02:25:08,750 --> 02:25:12,630
I mean this.

1032
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:16,840
It's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.

1033
02:25:24,850 --> 02:25:26,730
You do know it's a trap. Tell him!

1034
02:25:26,980 --> 02:25:30,310
If the Bruce wanted to kill you,
he'd have done it at Falkirk.

1035
02:25:30,560 --> 02:25:31,560
Aye.

1036
02:25:31,820 --> 02:25:33,230
I know. I saw.

1037
02:25:33,480 --> 02:25:36,780
All right, leaving him aside,
what about the others?

1038
02:25:37,030 --> 02:25:42,410
Scheming bastards who couldnae agree on
the color of shit! It's a trap! Are you blind?

1039
02:25:42,660 --> 02:25:44,580
Look at us.

1040
02:25:44,830 --> 02:25:46,750
We've got to try.

1041
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:51,080
We can't do this alone. Joining the nobles
is the only hope for our people.

1042
02:25:51,330 --> 02:25:54,340
- You know what happens if we don't?
- What?

1043
02:25:54,590 --> 02:25:58,220
Nothing.

1044
02:25:58,970 --> 02:26:02,300
- I don't want to be a martyr.
- Nor I.

1045
02:26:02,550 --> 02:26:04,470
I want to live.

1046
02:26:04,720 --> 02:26:07,310
I want a home, and children. And peace.

1047
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:09,440
- Do ye?
- Aye, I do.

1048
02:26:09,690 --> 02:26:14,110
I've asked God for those things.
It's all for nothing if you don't have freedom.

1049
02:26:14,360 --> 02:26:18,110
- It's just a dream, William.
- A dream? Just a...

1050
02:26:18,360 --> 02:26:21,820
Well, then,
what have we been doing all this time?

1051
02:26:22,070 --> 02:26:23,950
We've lived that dream.

1052
02:26:24,200 --> 02:26:27,870
Your dream isn't about freedom.
It's about Murron!

1053
02:26:28,120 --> 02:26:31,330
You're doing this to be a hero
because you think she sees ye!

1054
02:26:31,580 --> 02:26:34,670
I don't think she sees me. I know she does.

1055
02:26:34,920 --> 02:26:39,470
And your father sees you, too.

1056
02:26:47,180 --> 02:26:50,770
Jesus.

1057
02:26:55,320 --> 02:26:58,900
Shall I come with you?

1058
02:26:59,780 --> 02:27:03,280
No. I'll go alone.

1059
02:27:03,530 --> 02:27:05,410
I'll see you after.

1060
02:27:05,660 --> 02:27:08,870
Right.

1061
02:27:11,500 --> 02:27:15,710
Sooner rather than later, I hope.

1062
02:27:20,920 --> 02:27:24,260
- He won't come.
- He will.

1063
02:27:24,510 --> 02:27:28,140
I know he will.

1064
02:27:40,150 --> 02:27:43,740
My Lord! He approaches!

1065
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:29,870
No!

1066
02:28:33,040 --> 02:28:34,910
Stay out of it, Robert!

1067
02:28:35,170 --> 02:28:39,840
Aagh! Get away! Get away!

1068
02:28:40,880 --> 02:28:45,590
The Bruce is not to be harmed,
that's the arrangement.

1069
02:28:53,060 --> 02:28:56,100
Father!

1070
02:29:00,570 --> 02:29:03,230
You rotting bastard!

1071
02:29:03,490 --> 02:29:07,200
Why? Why?

1072
02:29:10,530 --> 02:29:13,240
Longshanks required Wallace.

1073
02:29:13,500 --> 02:29:15,870
So did our nobles.

1074
02:29:16,120 --> 02:29:18,500
That was the price of your crown.

1075
02:29:18,750 --> 02:29:20,960
Die!

1076
02:29:21,210 --> 02:29:23,380
I want you to die.

1077
02:29:23,630 --> 02:29:26,090
Soon enough I'll be dead.

1078
02:29:26,340 --> 02:29:28,220
And you'll be King.

1079
02:29:28,470 --> 02:29:30,970
I don't want anything from you!

1080
02:29:31,220 --> 02:29:33,470
You're not a man!

1081
02:29:33,720 --> 02:29:37,350
And you're not my father.

1082
02:29:39,980 --> 02:29:41,900
You're my son...

1083
02:29:42,150 --> 02:29:45,610
...and you have always known my mind.

1084
02:29:45,860 --> 02:29:47,780
You deceived me.

1085
02:29:48,030 --> 02:29:50,070
You let yourself be deceived.

1086
02:29:50,320 --> 02:29:56,120
In your heart, you always knew
what had to happen here.

1087
02:29:56,580 --> 02:29:58,460
At last...

1088
02:29:58,710 --> 02:30:02,670
...you know what it means to hate.

1089
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:09,630
Now you're ready to be a king.

1090
02:30:09,880 --> 02:30:11,800
My hate...

1091
02:30:12,050 --> 02:30:15,770
...will die with you.

1092
02:30:19,770 --> 02:30:23,570
William Wallace,
you stand in taint of high treason.

1093
02:30:23,820 --> 02:30:25,860
Against whom?

1094
02:30:26,110 --> 02:30:28,570
Against your King.

1095
02:30:28,820 --> 02:30:31,950
Have you anything to say?

1096
02:30:32,200 --> 02:30:35,790
Never in my whole life...

1097
02:30:35,830 --> 02:30:39,750
...did I swear allegiance to him.

1098
02:30:39,910 --> 02:30:44,250
It matters not. He is your King.

1099
02:30:44,790 --> 02:30:48,800
Confess and you may receive a quick death.

1100
02:30:49,050 --> 02:30:51,800
Deny and you must be purified by pain.

1101
02:30:52,050 --> 02:30:54,800
Do you confess?

1102
02:30:55,060 --> 02:31:00,480
Do you confess?

1103
02:31:04,650 --> 02:31:09,740
Then on the morrow
you shall receive your purification.

1104
02:31:19,870 --> 02:31:22,080
- Your Highness.
- I will see the prisoner.

1105
02:31:22,330 --> 02:31:26,210
- The King ordered that nobody...
- The King will die soon and his son is weak.

1106
02:31:26,460 --> 02:31:28,710
Who do you think will rule this kingdom?

1107
02:31:28,960 --> 02:31:32,550
Now open this door.

1108
02:31:32,800 --> 02:31:36,430
Your Majesty.

1109
02:31:40,430 --> 02:31:42,310
Come on, filth. Up on your feet!

1110
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:46,310
Stop it! Leave me.

1111
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:50,400
I said leave me!

1112
02:32:00,790 --> 02:32:03,960
My Lady.

1113
02:32:04,210 --> 02:32:06,750
Sir...

1114
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:10,300
I come to beg you...

1115
02:32:10,550 --> 02:32:15,260
...to confess all and swear allegiance
to the King that he might show you mercy.

1116
02:32:15,510 --> 02:32:19,180
Will he show mercy to my country?

1117
02:32:19,430 --> 02:32:21,390
Mercy is to die quickly...

1118
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:23,730
...perhaps even live in a tower.

1119
02:32:23,980 --> 02:32:27,190
In time, who knows what can happen?

1120
02:32:27,440 --> 02:32:31,070
If you can only live...

1121
02:32:34,650 --> 02:32:37,030
If I swear to him...

1122
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:42,200
...then all that I am is dead already.

1123
02:32:50,090 --> 02:32:52,090
You will die. It will be awful.

1124
02:32:52,340 --> 02:32:55,970
Every man dies.

1125
02:32:56,720 --> 02:33:00,350
Not every man really lives.

1126
02:33:06,020 --> 02:33:07,940
Drink this.

1127
02:33:08,190 --> 02:33:10,570
It will dull your pain.

1128
02:33:10,820 --> 02:33:12,980
No. It will numb my wits.

1129
02:33:13,230 --> 02:33:15,820
And I must have them all.

1130
02:33:16,070 --> 02:33:18,530
For if I'm senseless or if I wail...

1131
02:33:18,780 --> 02:33:20,910
...then Longshanks will have broken me.

1132
02:33:21,160 --> 02:33:23,700
I can't bear the thought of your torture.

1133
02:33:23,950 --> 02:33:27,580
Take it.

1134
02:33:30,670 --> 02:33:34,300
All right.

1135
02:34:20,180 --> 02:34:22,050
I have come...

1136
02:34:22,300 --> 02:34:24,560
...to beg for the life of William Wallace.

1137
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:28,770
You're quite taken with him, aren't you?

1138
02:34:29,020 --> 02:34:32,520
I respect him.

1139
02:34:33,320 --> 02:34:35,320
At worst, he was a worthy enemy.

1140
02:34:35,570 --> 02:34:39,570
Show mercy, O thou great King,
and win the respect of your own people.

1141
02:34:49,580 --> 02:34:52,170
Even now...

1142
02:34:52,420 --> 02:34:54,710
...you are incapable of mercy.

1143
02:35:00,220 --> 02:35:03,850
And you...

1144
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:09,770
To you, that word is as unfamiliar as love.

1145
02:35:10,020 --> 02:35:12,690
Before he lost his powers of speech...

1146
02:35:12,940 --> 02:35:14,860
...he told me his one comfort...

1147
02:35:15,110 --> 02:35:19,240
...was that he would live
to know Wallace was dead.

1148
02:35:36,750 --> 02:35:39,760
You see?

1149
02:35:40,010 --> 02:35:43,680
Death comes to us all.

1150
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:54,980
But before it comes to you...

1151
02:35:55,230 --> 02:35:57,320
...know this:

1152
02:35:57,570 --> 02:36:01,190
Your blood dies with you.

1153
02:36:02,240 --> 02:36:07,280
A child who is not of your line
grows in my belly.

1154
02:36:08,660 --> 02:36:14,000
Your son will not sit long on the throne,
I swear it.

1155
02:36:50,740 --> 02:36:54,330
I'm so afraid.

1156
02:37:00,050 --> 02:37:02,800
Give me the strength...

1157
02:37:03,050 --> 02:37:06,680
...to die well.

1158
02:37:16,980 --> 02:37:21,190
Boo!

1159
02:37:27,990 --> 02:37:32,040
Here he comes!

1160
02:38:58,160 --> 02:39:03,170
Now behold the awful price of treason!

1161
02:39:08,510 --> 02:39:12,140
Or fall to your knees now...

1162
02:39:12,510 --> 02:39:16,220
...declare yourself the King's loyal subject...

1163
02:39:16,470 --> 02:39:20,480
...and beg his mercy...

1164
02:39:25,190 --> 02:39:28,820
...and you shall have it.

1165
02:39:37,950 --> 02:39:40,580
Rope!

1166
02:39:52,550 --> 02:39:56,180
- Raise him.

1167
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:04,730
Stretch him!

1168
02:40:04,980 --> 02:40:06,860
That's it.

1169
02:40:07,110 --> 02:40:10,690
Stretch him!

1170
02:40:46,810 --> 02:40:50,530
Pleasant, yes?

1171
02:40:51,740 --> 02:40:53,950
Rise to your knees.

1172
02:40:54,200 --> 02:40:56,950
Kiss the royal emblem on my cloak...

1173
02:40:57,200 --> 02:41:00,450
...and you will feel no more.

1174
02:41:40,660 --> 02:41:42,450
Rack him!

1175
02:42:36,550 --> 02:42:40,180
Enough?

1176
02:43:30,100 --> 02:43:32,650
It can all end...

1177
02:43:32,900 --> 02:43:34,810
...right now.

1178
02:43:35,070 --> 02:43:37,650
Peace.

1179
02:43:38,190 --> 02:43:39,650
Bliss.

1180
02:43:39,900 --> 02:43:41,570
Just say it.

1181
02:43:41,820 --> 02:43:43,660
Cry out...

1182
02:43:43,910 --> 02:43:47,290
..."Mercy".

1183
02:43:55,590 --> 02:43:56,920
Mercy!

1184
02:43:57,170 --> 02:44:02,260
Mercy! Mercy!

1185
02:44:05,180 --> 02:44:07,810
Cry out.

1186
02:44:12,980 --> 02:44:18,480
Just say it. "Mercy".

1187
02:44:39,340 --> 02:44:42,170
Mercy, William. Mercy.

1188
02:44:42,420 --> 02:44:46,050
Jesus, man, say it.

1189
02:44:50,270 --> 02:44:55,270
The prisoner wishes to say a word.

1190
02:45:13,290 --> 02:45:24,090
Freedom!

1191
02:47:09,200 --> 02:47:11,450
<i>After the beheading...</i>

1192
02:47:11,700 --> 02:47:16,580
<i>...William Wallace's body was torn to pieces.</i>

1193
02:47:17,700 --> 02:47:22,040
<i>His head was set on London Bridge.</i>

1194
02:47:22,170 --> 02:47:24,250
<i>His arms and legs...</i>

1195
02:47:24,500 --> 02:47:27,800
<i>...sent to the four corners of Britain...</i>

1196
02:47:28,050 --> 02:47:29,920
<i>...as a warning.</i>

1197
02:47:30,180 --> 02:47:35,560
<i>It did not have the effect
that Longshanks planned.</i>

1198
02:47:35,890 --> 02:47:38,850
<i>And I, Robert the Bruce...</i>

1199
02:47:39,100 --> 02:47:44,060
<i>...rode out to pay homage
to the armies of the English King...</i>

1200
02:47:44,310 --> 02:47:47,360
<i>...and accept his endorsement of my crown.</i>

1201
02:47:47,610 --> 02:47:50,030
I hope you've washed your arse this morning.

1202
02:47:50,280 --> 02:47:54,160
It's about to be kissed by a king.

1203
02:48:22,140 --> 02:48:26,770
Come. Let's get it over with.

1204
02:48:36,950 --> 02:48:39,540
Stop!

1205
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:59,970
You have bled with Wallace!

1206
02:49:04,730 --> 02:49:08,150
Now bleed with me.

1207
02:49:47,190 --> 02:49:51,360
Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

1208
02:50:14,050 --> 02:50:16,970
<i>In the year of our Lord 1314...</i>

1209
02:50:17,220 --> 02:50:21,760
<i>...patriots of Scotland,
starving and outnumbered...</i>

1210
02:50:22,010 --> 02:50:25,140
<i>...charged the fields of Bannockburn.</i>

1211
02:50:25,390 --> 02:50:28,020
<i>They fought like warrior poets.</i>

1212
02:50:28,270 --> 02:50:31,270
<i>They fought like Scotsmen...</i>

1213
02:50:31,520 --> 02:50:35,150
<i>...and won their freedom.</i>
