00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,871
You know where it is.

346
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,832
Yeah, I know where it is.

347
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:44,588
And, uh... And we're going?

348
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:47,674
You and I are.

349
00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:52,387
The kid we gotta pitch
over the side.

350
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:58,227
- What?
- My boat's tore up.

351
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,812
I'm takin' on water.

352
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:04,316
I'd be lucky to get
half a hydro ration out of that.

353
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:08,028
You know...
I said I won't drink.

354
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,656
For 12 days?

355
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:15,160
No. It's better
one of you dies now...

356
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:17,287
than both of you die slow.

357
00:42:17,371 --> 00:42:19,581
Wait. Wait.

358
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:22,084
We saved your life.
We got you out.

359
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:26,255
No, you got me out so you
could get out. We're even.

360
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:28,382
She can cook.
She can fish.

361
00:42:28,423 --> 00:42:30,717
- So can I.
- Then take my necklace.
Take my necklace.

362
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:33,053
- I got better ones below.
- No, look!

363
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:35,931
Oh.

364
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:39,101
After what you went through
back there on the atoll,

365
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:42,354
I can understand
why you would want to.

366
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:44,439
But she's a child.

367
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:48,110
[Enola Humming]

368
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,870
Is there something else then?

369
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:05,878
Enola! Go below.

370
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:08,964
Enola.

371
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:22,644
Yeah. You said so yourself.

372
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:27,274
Been out there a long time.

373
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:15,989
Couple hours ago,
I was potential dirt to you.

374
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:19,451
- We're not like that.
- You all are.

375
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,335
Know what I was really thinkin'?

376
00:44:28,377 --> 00:44:31,547
Why I don't drop both of you
in my wake right now.

377
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:35,425
You got nothin' I need.

378
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:53,735
You're taking us to Dryland.

379
00:44:58,073 --> 00:45:00,909
Killing's a hard thing to do well.

380
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:04,413
- Believe me. I'm not
the one to start on.
- Both of us!

381
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:12,504
How long you plan
to hold that on me?

382
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:14,756
As long as it takes.

383
00:45:17,301 --> 00:45:20,345
- Okay.
- No!

384
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:25,142
Let me out of here!

385
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:29,062
Where the hell are you?
Don't you touch my child.

386
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:31,064
Come here!
[Indistinct Shouting]

387
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:34,610
[Groaning]

388
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:21,990
Okay, now don't move, okay?
There.

389
00:46:22,074 --> 00:46:25,494
Ohh. Oh, lookin'
real good, yeah.

390
00:46:25,536 --> 00:46:27,871
There. There.

391
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:29,873
All done.

392
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:32,960
Now, there may be some small problem
in depth perception.

393
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:35,879
Well, it better not
screw up my short game.

394
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,759
- Well?
- [Smokers] Looks good.
I like it. Yeah.

395
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:43,929
- I like it better than your real eye.
- Much better.

396
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:47,516
- What do you say, Toby? The truth.
- Looks like shit.

397
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,519
That's why I love children.
No guile.

398
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:58,277
It does look like shit.

399
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,279
And it feels like cold shit!

400
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:02,865
Deacon? What...

401
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:07,369
I'm sorry. L-lt's just that
there's a problem in the pit.

402
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:09,371
Maybe you should come.

403
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:18,213
- Let's drive.
- [Chattering]

404
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:27,556
The pit. Don't bother
with the scenic route.

405
00:47:27,598 --> 00:47:29,558
[Deacon] Drive!

406
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:32,895
Hey, it's drivin' better.

407
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:47,117
Get off!

408
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:50,579
Get over there.
Get out of the way.

409
00:47:50,662 --> 00:47:52,789
All right, all right, all right.
Okay, okay.

410
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:59,463
You guys are great.
Bless all you cousins over there.

411
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:04,009
Keep up the good work.
Growth is progress. Growth is progress.

412
00:48:04,092 --> 00:48:08,764
Somebody!
Hey, up there!

413
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:10,766
Take it off!

414
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:16,563
- Yes.
- Your Deaconship.

415
00:48:16,605 --> 00:48:20,567
Hello. Good morning.
Or night,

416
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:23,153
whichever the case may be.

417
00:48:23,237 --> 00:48:26,114
- What is it? I'm a busy man.
- I thought you should know.

418
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:28,825
We're down to exactly...

419
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:32,913
four feet, nine inches
of black stuff.

420
00:48:34,498 --> 00:48:39,169
- [Spitting]
- Thank you, sir.

421
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:42,130
- How many G's is that after refinin'?
- Maybe three refuelers.

422
00:48:42,172 --> 00:48:45,801
- We'll burn through that in two lunars.
- Sweet Joe!

423
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:49,471
Will somebody please tell me
what's happened to this place?

424
00:48:49,513 --> 00:48:51,598
We outgrowed it.

425
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,519
All right, the only thing
that is important is the tattooed girl.

426
00:48:55,602 --> 00:48:58,981
We don't spare any go-juice
findin' her.

427
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:02,150
We don't waste it anywhere else.
You cancel all those tractor pulls...

428
00:49:02,234 --> 00:49:04,111
and all that stuff
until later.

429
00:49:04,152 --> 00:49:06,154
You got it?

430
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:10,492
Dryland is the mother lode.

431
00:49:10,576 --> 00:49:12,703
[Laughing]
On your toes.

432
00:49:14,162 --> 00:49:16,081
Excellent.

433
00:49:45,569 --> 00:49:48,864
- Hi.
- Move.

434
00:49:48,947 --> 00:49:51,325
Enola!
Enola, come here!

435
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:55,537
Come on!

436
00:49:57,539 --> 00:49:59,499
Enola, come over here.

437
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:14,806
Hey!

438
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:21,605
- What are ya doin'?
- Decorating your boat. It's ugly.

439
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:28,904
- Where did you get this?
- From down below.

440
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:31,657
This is mine!
You don't touch anything of mine.

441
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,118
- I drew it for you.
- You don't draw on anything.
You understand?

442
00:50:40,707 --> 00:50:42,626
What...

443
00:50:44,878 --> 00:50:47,840
This is my boat.
I got it the way I like it.

444
00:50:47,923 --> 00:50:50,717
You take up space
and you slow me down.

445
00:50:54,638 --> 00:50:57,266
You know, she's just a little girl.

446
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:00,477
- She doesn't know your rules.
- You wanna stay?

447
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:02,479
You teach her.

448
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:24,126
Enola, what'd I tell you?

449
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:31,800
You're not so tough.
You know that?

450
00:51:36,138 --> 00:51:38,056
How many people
have you killed?

451
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:43,729
Ten? Twenty?

452
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:50,319
- You talk a lot.
- I talk a lot 'cause
you don't talk at all.

453
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,321
Now how many?

454
00:51:54,156 --> 00:51:57,868
- Including little girls?
- I'm not afraid of you.

455
00:52:01,747 --> 00:52:05,000
I told Helen you wouldn't be so ugly
if you cut your hair.

456
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:11,006
In fact, you talk all the time.

457
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:13,175
- It's like a storm
when you're around.
- Enola!

458
00:52:13,258 --> 00:52:15,844
Hey! What are you doing?

459
00:52:15,928 --> 00:52:19,056
- [Enola] Helen!
- [Helen] You bastard!
She can't swim!

460
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:22,017
Help me! Helen!

461
00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:25,646
Helen, help me!

462
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:28,315
Helen!

463
00:52:28,357 --> 00:52:30,400
[Sobbing]
Helen, help me!

464
00:52:32,736 --> 00:52:35,447
[Gasping]

465
00:52:38,909 --> 00:52:41,578
Helen! Helen!

466
00:52:41,662 --> 00:52:44,206
Hold on!

467
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,667
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

468
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:51,755
Oh, please, come back.
Please!

469
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,342
Please! Oh, please!

470
00:52:55,384 --> 00:52:57,344
[Choking]

471
00:53:00,138 --> 00:53:02,724
Hey! [Gasping]

472
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:06,687
Hold on.
Okay, almost...

473
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:10,190
there.

474
00:53:20,242 --> 00:53:21,493
Thanks. I swear,

475
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:25,372
if you ever touch her again...

476
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:27,583
You son of a bitch.
Look at me.

477
00:53:27,624 --> 00:53:30,210
You will go to bed that night,
and you will never wake up.

478
00:53:30,252 --> 00:53:32,588
- Shut up.
- What?

479
00:53:32,629 --> 00:53:35,591
- [Helen] Smokers?
- Yeah.

480
00:53:35,674 --> 00:53:37,926
Can't we outrun them?

481
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,972
- [Engine Humming]
- Not with my sail down.

482
00:54:00,115 --> 00:54:04,161
- What are you thinkin' about?
- That's a nice touch.

483
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:06,163
That's them.

484
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:15,214
Don't hit the kid.

485
00:54:19,885 --> 00:54:22,054
[Cackling]

486
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:32,523
Hey!

487
00:54:37,486 --> 00:54:39,571
Coward!

488
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:47,704
[Laughing]

489
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:50,123
Fuck!

490
00:55:17,568 --> 00:55:20,362
No!

491
00:55:22,281 --> 00:55:25,409
[Groaning]

492
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:34,042
[Indistinct]

493
00:55:41,216 --> 00:55:43,135
Cut it!

494
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:54,229
Come on! Come on!

495
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:29,223
[Yells]
All right. Okay.

496
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:05,259
[Gunfire]

497
00:57:29,157 --> 00:57:32,411
[Helen]
Oh, I'm really sorry.

498
00:57:32,494 --> 00:57:35,664
I'm sorry.
But you didn't give me much choice.

499
00:57:35,706 --> 00:57:38,667
Oh, I know.

500
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:41,503
But you ran away.
L... What?

501
00:57:41,545 --> 00:57:45,382
What are you do...
No! Please, no! No!

502
00:57:50,179 --> 00:57:52,264
[Grunting]

503
00:57:54,474 --> 00:57:58,770
Don't ever touch
anything on my boat again.

504
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:04,193
She said she was sorry!

505
00:58:08,197 --> 00:58:10,991
That means you're supposed
to say something back!

506
00:58:34,223 --> 00:58:36,225
- Did you say somethin'?
- [Enola] Mm-mmm.

507
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:02,167
[Deacon] The child...
did he have the girl with him?

508
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:04,503
- [Pilot] Uh-huh.
- Seems to me if we launch now,

509
00:59:04,586 --> 00:59:06,713
we can cut him down
just about here.

510
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:11,927
- If he doesn't change course.
- Ah, it's not likely.

511
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:15,639
He's a wily one,
that ichthy-demon.

512
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:18,308
Yeah, if he knows
he's been spotted,

513
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:22,187
he'll expect us to expect him
to change course,

514
00:59:22,229 --> 00:59:25,816
which is exactly why
he'll keep his heading.

515
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:29,111
The important question is,
where's he heading?

516
00:59:29,194 --> 00:59:32,739
And does he know
how precious his cargo is?

517
00:59:32,823 --> 00:59:37,202
I say that he's headed here,
and we take him here.

518
00:59:45,002 --> 00:59:48,297
[Drifter Shouting]

519
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:50,549
- Drifter?
- Mm-hmm.

520
00:59:50,632 --> 00:59:52,551
- [Shouting Continues]
- [Helen] Are we gonna stop?

521
00:59:52,634 --> 00:59:54,553
- Look at the flag!
- His flag's up.

522
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:56,722
I thought you all
stopped for each other.

523
01:00:02,019 --> 01:00:04,688
Well... maybe he has some food!

524
01:00:08,192 --> 01:00:10,819
Don't find many who follow
the rules anymore.

525
01:00:10,861 --> 01:00:13,697
Well, make it quick.
What's your business?

526
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,662
Trade.

527
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:24,583
You got any resin?

528
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:31,256
Resin? He's gotta be out of
his mind. He's out of his mind.
I don't have any resin.

529
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,800
- [Babbling]
- You been outwater
a long time, haven't you?

530
01:00:35,636 --> 01:00:38,055
Must be jokin' me, man.
Resin! You don't got enough.

531
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:40,349
How 'bout food?

532
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:42,434
Could you say that again, please?

533
01:00:42,518 --> 01:00:45,437
- How 'bout food?
- Ah, yeah, food.

534
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:48,023
Yeah, that'd be good, eh?

535
01:00:48,065 --> 01:00:51,068
I haven't eaten in, well,
you know, forever.

536
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,780
Which one of you two is a cook?

537
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:58,534
'Cause I usually fall for the waitress.
[Chuckling]

538
01:00:58,617 --> 01:01:00,619
Like you said,
I don't have much.

539
01:01:00,702 --> 01:01:03,914
Now listen, eh? [Mumbles]
Let's see. What do I have to do?

540
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:07,835
We can start with that wee orchard
you got over there.

541
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:12,756
- [Whooping]
- All right, hold it there.

542
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:16,260
- [Mariner] We can talk.
- [Drifter] Fair enough.

543
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:19,304
[Babbling]

544
01:01:21,223 --> 01:01:23,600
It's a nice rod, isn't it?

545
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:26,728
I like that rod.
It's a nice rod. [Babbles]

546
01:01:33,068 --> 01:01:35,863
Got yourself a wee harem
goin' here now, do ya?

547
01:01:42,452 --> 01:01:44,580
What you want for the women?

548
01:01:44,621 --> 01:01:47,040
We're not for sale.

549
01:01:47,082 --> 01:01:49,793
Not for sale?
There's no such thing as not for sale.

550
01:01:49,877 --> 01:01:52,129
"Not for sale"!
Not for sale, eh?

551
01:01:54,131 --> 01:01:57,634
- Are they a pair or would you
consider sellin' 'em separate?
- No.

552
01:01:57,718 --> 01:02:01,722
Our business is done here unless you got
some resin for sale you can part with.

553
01:02:01,763 --> 01:02:03,724
I told you once already,
I don't have it.

554
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:06,560
I-I-I don't have it.
Don't have it. Don't have it.

555
01:02:06,602 --> 01:02:10,772
Haven't seen neither for trade
in lunars now. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

556
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:16,278
I do have somethin' that'll
make you change your mind.

557
01:02:17,571 --> 01:02:21,200
Somethin' that you can't pass on.
[Giggles]

558
01:02:21,283 --> 01:02:25,579
I took it off
an Atoller refugee camp.

559
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:27,581
The life savings
of the entire clan.

560
01:02:35,547 --> 01:02:38,550
Paper.
[Babbles]

561
01:02:38,634 --> 01:02:44,139
It's paper. Have you ever
seen paper? Look at it.

562
01:02:44,181 --> 01:02:46,141
Smell it.

563
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:49,978
I been savin' it
for a special trade.

564
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:55,734
Don't you do it.

565
01:02:55,817 --> 01:02:58,695
You know, maybe I'm talkin'
to the wrong person here.

566
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:00,948
Whose boat is this?
Is it your boat or your boat?

567
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:04,660
No. No, it's his boat.
But he doesn't own us.

568
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:13,669
Half an hour.

569
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:17,297
[Mumbling, Babbling]
Out of his mind somethin' there.

570
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:21,343
I got two pages in here, man!
I mean, I'd get half a dozen
girls with this, you know.

571
01:03:21,385 --> 01:03:24,054
Half an hour.

572
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:26,265
- You tradin' or not?
- Don't.

573
01:03:26,348 --> 01:03:28,308
Shut up.

574
01:03:29,852 --> 01:03:31,979
Okay.

575
01:03:33,564 --> 01:03:35,858
Forty-five minutes
with the wee one right there.

576
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:38,360
I like to do the talkin',
if you know what I mean.

577
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,030
No!

578
01:03:43,073 --> 01:03:46,159
Fair. Come, come,
come, come, come!

579
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:48,579
No. My boat.

580
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:53,917
- Fair enough. Fair enough.
Good, good, good. Aye.
- Helen.

581
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:57,546
- Sit down.
- Enola, just do as he says.

582
01:03:59,756 --> 01:04:01,884
[Chuckling]

583
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,803
It's been a while for me now.

584
01:04:46,887 --> 01:04:50,474
Guess it's been
more than a while, actually.

585
01:04:53,644 --> 01:04:58,607
I've only got half an hour.
[Repeating] Half an hour,
half an hour, half an hour...

586
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:01,610
[Mumbles]
Great, great, great...

587
01:05:01,693 --> 01:05:06,448
[Gasps] Ooh! You're so beautiful.
Aye! Anyone ever told you that?

588
01:05:06,532 --> 01:05:09,451
Give me that. What are you doin'?
It's just a game.

589
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:15,832
Oh, I, um... I, uh...
We was just playin'.

590
01:05:18,961 --> 01:05:21,004
The trade's off.

591
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:22,965
I changed my mind.

592
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:27,010
Well, um... Well,
you can't do that.

593
01:05:27,094 --> 01:05:29,555
I mean, a deal's a deal, eh?

594
01:05:29,638 --> 01:05:31,473
I just did.

595
01:05:31,974 --> 01:05:33,767
Hey!

596
01:05:33,809 --> 01:05:38,355
She's mine. Aye. No. No, no
I own her. But... No.

597
01:05:38,438 --> 01:05:41,316
- Go on.
- Get, get, get.
Go, go, go. Good, good.

598
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,821
But don't go too far now.
This won't take but a minute.

599
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:56,290
I hate this boat.
I hate this boat!

600
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:59,042
You bastard.

601
01:06:03,255 --> 01:06:08,177
You... You're pretty stingy for a man
who's got everything, aren't ya now?

602
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:14,266
Oh-h-h. Ohh.

Where's me boat?

607
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:43,837
Where's me boat?

608

[Mumbling]

609
01:06:51,136 --> 01:06:53,055
Help me to me boat.

610
01:06:54,598 --> 01:06:56,558
Ow! Me boat.

611
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:00,604
Me boat.

612
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:31,510
[Helen]
What the... No!

613
01:07:33,929 --> 01:07:36,223
Never catch anything
with this. It's useless.

614
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,018
[Helen Gasps]

615
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:46,567
Look, I'm sorry.
You were right about the pole.

616
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:50,362
You were right,
but we have to eat.

617
01:07:56,076 --> 01:07:58,078
Now I know
you can hear me!

618
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,623
Now we can fish for ourselves.
You show us what to do.

619
01:08:01,665 --> 01:08:03,959
You must know how.
Even you gotta eat!

620
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:06,378
You just sit there.

621
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:32,946
- What...
- [Mumbling] I don't know.

622
01:09:08,774 --> 01:09:10,692
Happy now?

[Humming Continues]

625
01:09:28,877 --> 01:09:30,796
You don't like my singing,
do you?

626
01:09:33,715 --> 01:09:37,761
Helen says you don't like my singing
'cause you can't sing.

627
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:46,562
- Ever try and listen?
- To what?

628
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:51,900
The sound of the world.

629
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:58,991
- I don't hear anything.
- That's because you're too loud,

630
01:09:59,074 --> 01:10:00,993
and you're movin' around
all the time.

631
01:10:01,076 --> 01:10:03,829
Try sittin' still.

632
01:10:03,912 --> 01:10:06,915
Eyeball?

633
01:10:21,305 --> 01:10:23,348
I wish I had feet like his.

634
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:28,312
Then maybe I could swim.

635
01:10:28,395 --> 01:10:30,063
Enola.

636
01:10:33,734 --> 01:10:35,819
[Burps] Sorry.

637
01:10:40,532 --> 01:10:42,993
Never met a person
couldn't swim before.

638
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:48,624
I can't.

639
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:52,169
People say I was weird.

640
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:54,171
Maybe they were right.

641
01:10:57,716 --> 01:11:00,135
Maybe they were right
about you too.

642
01:11:27,996 --> 01:11:29,957
Enola wanted to give you this.

643
01:11:34,253 --> 01:11:36,880
And this.

644
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:41,134
She won't take it again.

645
01:11:47,558 --> 01:11:50,519
You don't look much like her.

646
01:11:50,561 --> 01:11:54,606
- Well, I'm not her mother,
if that's what you're asking.
- You act like it.

647
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,571
What are those marks
on her back?

648
01:12:00,654 --> 01:12:03,323
Nothing.
They're just fanciful things.

649
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:08,745
- Like what she draws?
- She draws what she sees.

650
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:11,665
She's like a mirror.

651
01:12:11,707 --> 01:12:13,792
People on the atoll
thought she was a...

652
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:18,297
Freak?

653
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:20,757
Uh-huh. Yeah.

654
01:12:20,841 --> 01:12:22,801
I just thought
she was special.

655
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:34,313
I'm not givin' it
to her. It's just...

656
01:12:34,396 --> 01:12:36,148
A loan.

657
01:12:36,231 --> 01:12:39,193
Yeah. I'm not
givin' it to her.

658
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:48,202
Is Dryland beautiful?

659
01:12:49,745 --> 01:12:52,080
You'll see.

660
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:14,811
[Enola Laughing, Giggling]

661
01:13:17,856 --> 01:13:20,275
- Enola?
- [Laughing]

662
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:22,361
Enola, what are you doing?

663
01:13:22,444 --> 01:13:25,864
- Those monsters'll kill her!
- No, they're asleep now.

664
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:31,036
Hands around my neck.

665
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,541
Let the water tell your arms
and legs how to move.

666
01:13:35,624 --> 01:13:37,793
We're goin' down.
Hold your breath.

667
01:15:17,309 --> 01:15:20,312
- What is it?
- What is it?

668
01:15:22,397 --> 01:15:24,483
Barter outpost.

669
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:26,527
You said we'd get
to Dryland today.

670
01:15:26,568 --> 01:15:29,738
Today. Tomorrow.
What's it matter?

671
01:15:31,365 --> 01:15:33,283
I need resin.

672
01:15:42,918 --> 01:15:48,340
- What is that?
- It's PortuGreek. Their own language.

673
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:53,637
Or so I thought.

674
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,332
Ah.

01:16:22,416 --> 01:16:25,752
There's my girl. Yeah.

Howdy, darlin'.
Come on in here now.

01:16:58,994 --> 01:17:01,371
- What's going on?
- Smokers.

678

What the hell?

01:18:04,518 --> 01:18:07,396
Watch it.
He's clearin' the net.

687
01:18:18,782 --> 01:18:20,951
Go to the helm.

688
01:18:22,744 --> 01:18:25,122
- Get the centerboard!
- Centerboard?

689
01:18:25,205 --> 01:18:27,958
What centerboard?
I don't know what to do!

690
01:18:30,586 --> 01:18:32,629
It's too late.
Over here!

691
01:18:45,642 --> 01:18:49,271
[Screaming, Yelling]

692
01:18:52,232 --> 01:18:54,193
No!

693
01:19:10,459 --> 01:19:15,339
Gimme that rifle.
Boy, if you wanna do somethin' right,

694
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:18,091
you've got to do it yourself.

695
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:20,093
[Whispers]
All right.

696
01:19:26,642 --> 01:19:28,602
- I winged him.
- I say we load...

697
01:19:28,644 --> 01:19:31,813
all the go-juice onto one boat
and run the freak down.

698
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:35,192
You can't catch him in ten boats,
and you wanna send just one?

699
01:19:35,275 --> 01:19:37,903
Well, I pray that you're jokin'.

700
01:19:46,328 --> 01:19:49,373
Bring me the trackers.

701
01:19:54,127 --> 01:19:56,588
He's hurt.

702
01:19:56,672 --> 01:19:59,007
It's not what you think.
They weren't after her.

703
01:19:59,091 --> 01:20:01,718
- I saw what I saw.
- What?

704
01:20:06,098 --> 01:20:08,016
No more lies.

705
01:20:09,518 --> 01:20:12,729
- [Shrieks]
- What are the marks on her back?

706
01:20:12,813 --> 01:20:15,482
People say it's the way to Dryland.

707
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:18,151
Dryland's a myth!

708
01:20:18,193 --> 01:20:21,238
No! You said so yourself
that you know where it is.

709
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:23,240
You did.

710
01:20:27,452 --> 01:20:30,664
You're a fool to believe in something
you've never seen before.

711
01:20:30,706 --> 01:20:35,169
I've seen it. I've touched it!
Dirt that was richer
and darker than yours.

712
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:37,129
It was in the basket
we found Enola in!

713
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:39,840
- It doesn't exist!
- Well, how can you be so sure?

714
01:20:39,882 --> 01:20:44,636
Because I've sailed farther than most
have dreamed, and I've never seen it.

715
01:20:46,555 --> 01:20:49,391
But the things on your boat!

716
01:20:49,433 --> 01:20:51,852
"Things on my boat" what?

717
01:20:51,894 --> 01:20:55,355
There are things on your boat
that nobody has ever seen!

718
01:20:55,397 --> 01:20:57,566
What are these shells?

719
01:20:57,649 --> 01:21:00,777
And that reflecting glass?

720
01:21:00,861 --> 01:21:05,240
And th-the music box?
That...

721
01:21:05,282 --> 01:21:08,994
Well, if not from Dryland,
then where? Wh-Where?

722
01:21:11,872 --> 01:21:13,832
You wanna see Dryland?

723
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:17,461
You really wanna see it?

724
01:21:19,129 --> 01:21:21,215
I'll take you to Dryland.

725
01:21:28,555 --> 01:21:30,474
Get in.

726
01:21:36,438 --> 01:21:39,608
- Well, what about Enola?
- There's only air for one.

727
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:41,985
- Get in the water.
- It'll be all right.

728
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:49,701
Don't touch anything.

729
01:21:54,456 --> 01:21:56,416
Okay?

730
01:25:27,503 --> 01:25:29,463
I didn't know.

731
01:25:31,298 --> 01:25:34,301
All this time...

732
01:25:34,343 --> 01:25:36,303
I didn't know.

733
01:25:36,345 --> 01:25:38,305
Nobody does.

734
01:25:46,355 --> 01:25:48,357
Can you get us outta here?

735
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:51,902
I'd say there're
two chances o' that.

736
01:25:51,985 --> 01:25:54,404
- Hey!
- No way and no how.

737
01:25:54,488 --> 01:25:58,200
Shoulda bought me
that drink. Come on!

738
01:25:58,283 --> 01:26:00,077
This way. Come on!

739
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:04,998
[Men Yelling, Cheering]

740
01:26:06,834 --> 01:26:09,086
Proper introductions first.

741
01:26:10,212 --> 01:26:12,673
I'm the Deacon.

742
01:26:12,714 --> 01:26:16,927
[Men Laughing]

743
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:21,723
If you don't recall the face,
perhaps it's 'cause I didn't
always look like this.

744
01:26:24,852 --> 01:26:28,480
Now, ahem, I suspect
she's somewhere real close.

745
01:26:28,564 --> 01:26:34,403
So we can tear this boat apart
lookin' for her, but I'd rather
somebody tell me where she is.

746
01:26:34,486 --> 01:26:37,322
And the first one
that does that, lives.

747
01:26:37,406 --> 01:26:41,785
And the runner-up...
Well, actually, there are no runners-up.

748
01:26:44,413 --> 01:26:47,040
Oh, sweet Joe,
I love this part.

749
01:26:47,082 --> 01:26:49,960
Choose 'em. One, two.
Live or die.

750
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:54,631
You know, personally,

751
01:26:54,715 --> 01:26:57,634
I'd rather shoot
the sperm-of-the-devil here.

752
01:26:57,718 --> 01:27:00,929
Huh? But you know somethin'?

753
01:27:01,013 --> 01:27:03,515
I don't think you're gonna
tell me, are ya?

754
01:27:03,599 --> 01:27:05,517
Huh? Too bad.

755
01:27:06,643 --> 01:27:10,147
Come on, eh?
What do you say?

756
01:27:10,230 --> 01:27:12,149
She's not your kind.

757
01:27:13,609 --> 01:27:16,111
You don't even have a kind.

758
01:27:16,195 --> 01:27:20,324
If you say it,
he'll still kill us both.

759
01:27:20,407 --> 01:27:23,493
[Deacon Grunts]

760
01:27:24,661 --> 01:27:26,622
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

761
01:27:28,624 --> 01:27:30,584
If you don't tell me,

762
01:27:30,626 --> 01:27:33,212
I swear to Poseidon
I will torch your boat.

763
01:27:39,801 --> 01:27:43,305
Refresh my memory.
What happens when neither of 'em talks?

764
01:27:43,347 --> 01:27:46,183
- Never happened before.
- Never happened before.

765
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:48,894
[Sighs]
All right!

766
01:27:48,977 --> 01:27:54,066
If they won't tell us where
she is, do 'em! Both of 'em!
Kill 'em now! [Fires Gun]

767
01:27:54,149 --> 01:27:57,027
- No!
- [Helen] No!

768
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:59,029
So gullible!
Bring her here.

01:27:59,112 --> 01:28:01,532
[Men Cheering, Shouting]

770
01:28:01,615 --> 01:28:04,326
- Take and ye shall receive!
- [Helen] No! Leave her!

771
01:28:04,409 --> 01:28:07,079
So ends your daily sermonette!
[Laughing]

772
01:28:07,162 --> 01:28:10,999
All we gotta do is figure out this map.
Turn her upside down.

773
01:28:11,083 --> 01:28:14,419
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.

774
01:28:14,503 --> 01:28:18,006
[Deacon] We'll figure it out back
at the 'Deez. Back at the 'Deez, boys.

775
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:20,425
Careful with her.
Careful with her!

776
01:28:20,509 --> 01:28:22,386
- What about them?
- Do 'em both.

777
01:28:22,469 --> 01:28:25,055
Torch the boat.

778
01:28:28,517 --> 01:28:31,436
We have to go under!

779
01:28:32,563 --> 01:28:35,440
No, I can't breath like you!

780
01:28:35,524 --> 01:28:37,442
I'll breathe for both of us.

781
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:04,011
[Man] Whoo!

782
01:29:04,052 --> 01:29:06,013
[Enola] Helen!

783
01:29:08,056 --> 01:29:13,604
Helen, help!
Helen! Helen!

784
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:46,720
My boat.

785
01:29:56,146 --> 01:29:58,106
Enola.

786
01:29:58,148 --> 01:30:00,400
[Door Opens]

787
01:30:00,442 --> 01:30:03,278
What is this?
Get those chains off her.

788
01:30:03,362 --> 01:30:06,281
What are we, barbarians here?

789
01:30:06,365 --> 01:30:08,784
Goodness gracious.
Sakes alive.

790
01:30:08,825 --> 01:30:11,286
Come on. Outta here,
you big, nasty animal, you!

791
01:30:12,955 --> 01:30:15,374
Well, rub-a-dub-dub.
[Chuckles]

792
01:30:17,292 --> 01:30:20,671
You wanna come over here
and sit on my lap?

793
01:30:20,754 --> 01:30:23,465
No? Ahem.

794
01:30:23,549 --> 01:30:26,552
How 'bout a cigarette?

795
01:30:26,635 --> 01:30:30,055
Nothin' like a good smoke
if you miss your mom.

796
01:30:30,138 --> 01:30:32,057
Never too young to start.

797
01:30:33,684 --> 01:30:37,062
No. Well, I got somethin'
right here I know you'd like.

798
01:30:38,814 --> 01:30:41,358
Like to draw, don't you? Huh?

799
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:47,573
Huh?
Now they're yours...

800
01:30:47,656 --> 01:30:51,910
if you help me with just
one problem, all right?

801
01:30:54,913 --> 01:30:58,500
Now, ahem... Now that tattoo
on your back... Ahem.

802
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:04,673
I've been told that, uh...
that's actually a map?

803
01:31:07,843 --> 01:31:10,220
It's the way to Dryland.

804
01:31:10,304 --> 01:31:12,222
Now we're gettin' someplace.

805
01:31:14,016 --> 01:31:16,810
Could you teach me
how to read that?

806
01:31:19,688 --> 01:31:21,648
Setback.

807
01:31:23,859 --> 01:31:27,988
Well, have you ever heard
any of your friends talk about it?

808
01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:33,202
You know, like your mommy or
your pet fish? Did he say anything?

809
01:31:33,243 --> 01:31:35,704
You shouldn't make fun of him.
He wouldn't like it.

810
01:31:35,746 --> 01:31:41,168
Girl, I don't give a shit
what he'd like. He took out my eye.

811
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:47,174
And if I ever see him again, I'm gonna
cut open his head and eat his brains!

812
01:31:47,216 --> 01:31:49,468
You think he'd like that?

813
01:31:49,551 --> 01:31:53,305
Can't kill him.
He's even meaner than you are.

814
01:31:54,389 --> 01:31:56,558
But he's not here.

815
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,560
And he ain't comin'.

816
01:31:58,602 --> 01:32:00,479
And no one's gonna save you.

817
01:32:01,897 --> 01:32:03,815
He'll come for me. He will.

818
01:32:03,899 --> 01:32:07,945
Then you better tell me what I wanna
know or he can see what's left of you...

819
01:32:08,028 --> 01:32:10,197
in a goddamn jar.

820
01:32:20,499 --> 01:32:22,876
We're going to die here,
aren't we?

821
01:32:42,771 --> 01:32:44,690
Aren't we?

822
01:32:54,116 --> 01:32:56,827
After the atoll,

823
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:59,580
when I offered myself to you,

824
01:33:02,165 --> 01:33:04,626
why didn't you take me?

825
01:33:06,503 --> 01:33:08,463
'Cause you didn't really want me.

826
01:33:10,424 --> 01:33:13,427
Not really.

827
01:35:09,168 --> 01:35:11,503
Have I been asleep long?

828
01:35:17,217 --> 01:35:19,136
I was dreaming.

829
01:35:21,638 --> 01:35:24,641
It's funny.

830
01:35:24,725 --> 01:35:27,436
I always thought Dryland floated.

831
01:35:27,519 --> 01:35:30,939
That it drifted with the wind.
That's why it was so hard to find.

832
01:35:30,981 --> 01:35:33,275
Why did you believe in it so much?

833
01:35:34,568 --> 01:35:37,112
Because we weren't made for the sea.

834
01:35:38,447 --> 01:35:41,700
Got hands... and feet.

835
01:35:41,783 --> 01:35:44,411
We're supposed to walk.

836
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:49,374
I miss her sound.

837
01:35:51,919 --> 01:35:53,837
Don't you?

838
01:35:57,341 --> 01:35:59,218
[Gregor] Helen!

839
01:35:59,301 --> 01:36:02,471
He... No, no, no.
Helen, up here. Above you!

840
01:36:02,513 --> 01:36:05,098
- [Chuckling]
- [Helen] Gregor!

841
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:09,353
[Chuckling Continues]

842
01:36:09,436 --> 01:36:12,189
Smart thinking
to burn your boat.

843
01:36:12,272 --> 01:36:16,026
Without the smoke,
I never would have found you.

844
01:36:16,109 --> 01:36:18,153
Who's that with you?

845
01:36:18,195 --> 01:36:21,907
Ichthyus Sapien,
is that really you?

846
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:25,953
I'll throw the rope down.
You catch it. I'll help you climb up.

847
01:36:28,163 --> 01:36:31,667
Helen. Where's Enola?

848
01:36:31,708 --> 01:36:37,130
Smokers took her. They'd have me too
if it weren't for him.

849
01:36:37,172 --> 01:36:41,385
My friend, thank you.
Very human of you.

850
01:36:43,345 --> 01:36:46,014
Go grab your things quickly.
Quickly. Come.

851
01:36:53,897 --> 01:36:55,941
[Gregor] You see?
Right down there.

852
01:36:56,024 --> 01:36:59,027
There's several of us survivors.
We'll just start over again.

853
01:37:01,071 --> 01:37:03,031
[Man] You can't ask us
to go get her!

854
01:37:03,073 --> 01:37:05,325
[Woman] Enola's the reason
we're in all this trouble.

855
01:37:05,367 --> 01:37:10,163
[Helen] They don't have any
reason to kill her. They need
to find Dryland just like we do.

856
01:37:10,205 --> 01:37:14,209
- Of course.
- [Helen] If the Mariner's
willing to go, why not us?

857
01:37:14,251 --> 01:37:16,378
[Woman]
If he wants to go, then let him!

858
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:19,673
[Woman #2] We don't want you here!
You or the girl!

859
01:37:19,715 --> 01:37:24,178
Helen. The papers
the Mariner brought you...

860
01:37:24,219 --> 01:37:28,891
It's the same language the tattoo
is written in. They're numbers.

861
01:37:28,932 --> 01:37:32,227
- [Man] Gregor,
you're as crazy as she is!
- [Woman] We can't stay here!

862
01:37:32,311 --> 01:37:35,898
We're wasting valuable time.
More Smokers will come.
We need to be moving now!

863
01:37:35,981 --> 01:37:40,360
My friends, don't you see we need
this child if we want to find Dryland?

864
01:37:40,402 --> 01:37:42,404
- I'm not goin'.
- Nobody is.

865
01:37:42,446 --> 01:37:44,865
[Woman] We've seen their smoke
on the horizon!

866
01:37:44,907 --> 01:37:47,701
- Know what that is yet?
- The numbers? Yes, I think I do.

867
01:37:47,743 --> 01:37:53,290
It seems to be some ancient form
of geographic location:
Latitude, longitude.

868
01:37:53,373 --> 01:37:58,212
It doesn't make sense, though.
The numbers, they seem
to be backwards or something.

869
01:37:58,253 --> 01:38:00,422
- It's upside down.
- The world?

870
01:38:00,506 --> 01:38:03,133
The poles have reversed themselves?

871
01:38:03,217 --> 01:38:05,469
I've been mappin' the cities below.

872
01:38:08,263 --> 01:38:11,683
The world wasn't created in a deluge.
It was covered by it.

873
01:38:11,767 --> 01:38:14,978
- [Man] That's blasphemy!
- [Helen] No, it's true.

874
01:38:15,062 --> 01:38:19,775
I've seen it with
my own eyes. There is land.
It's right under our keel.

875
01:38:19,816 --> 01:38:21,944
- None of it's dry anymore.
- Some is.

876
01:38:23,403 --> 01:38:27,991
Enola's been there.
I know that now. I saw what she drew.

877
01:38:28,075 --> 01:38:31,912
So that's why he's going after Enola...
to find Dryland.

878
01:38:31,954 --> 01:38:34,665
I don't care about Dryland.

879
01:38:34,748 --> 01:38:37,584
This is ridiculous.
Going after the Smokers?

880
01:38:37,626 --> 01:38:39,920
He doesn't even know
which direction they came from.

881
01:38:39,962 --> 01:38:44,800
- [Man] I say let him go.
- [Woman] We're better off
without them anyway!

882
01:38:44,883 --> 01:38:48,637
If she's alive,
I'll bring her back to you.

883
01:38:48,679 --> 01:38:53,308
[Woman] Forget the mute-o, Helen.
If he brings her back, they'll kill us!

884
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:57,020
I can't stand it. We gotta go help him.
I can't ask him to do this alone.

885
01:38:57,104 --> 01:39:01,149
Oh, don't worry, my dear.
You're not going to have to.

886
01:39:07,239 --> 01:39:10,200
[Deacon] You got that tattoo
figured out yet?

887
01:39:10,242 --> 01:39:12,870
It would be easier if it was flat...
big and flat.

888
01:39:12,911 --> 01:39:15,789
- It needs to be flat.
- What you got in mind?

889
01:39:15,873 --> 01:39:20,210
Well, you cut it off her back.
You stretch it, mount it.

890
01:39:20,252 --> 01:39:23,922
- Give us a proper look.
- Take her down below until I holler.

891
01:39:24,006 --> 01:39:26,258
Saint Joe, we're close.

892
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:30,846
After centuries of shame.

893
01:40:06,965 --> 01:40:09,009

[Crowd Shouting]

897
01:41:01,228 --> 01:41:04,898
- They're gettin' ugly.
- Don't I know it.

898
01:41:04,982 --> 01:41:07,025
Announce me, cousin.

899
01:41:08,735 --> 01:41:11,029
[Crowd Chanting]

900
01:41:11,071 --> 01:41:13,198
- [Microphone Popping]
- Hey. Here he is.

901
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:15,200
[Crowd] Deacon!

902
01:41:15,242 --> 01:41:17,786
Rise up, brothers and sisters.

903
01:41:19,454 --> 01:41:22,875
Turn your eyes and open your hearts...

904
01:41:22,958 --> 01:41:25,377
to your humble benefactor,

905
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:29,339
your spiritual shepherd
and dictator for life,

906
01:41:29,381 --> 01:41:32,384
the Deacon of the 'Deez.

01:41:53,947 --> 01:41:57,075
- Look out!
- It's mine! It's mine!

01:41:57,159 --> 01:41:59,536
[Confused Shouting]

911
01:42:03,749 --> 01:42:07,085
- Deacon!
- Wahoo!

912
01:42:07,169 --> 01:42:12,925
Children.
Children of the provider.

913
01:42:13,008 --> 01:42:16,887
Citizens of the good ship.
Please now, hear me speak.

914
01:42:20,891 --> 01:42:23,977
- I've had a vision.
- [Man] Yeah, we're
tired of your visions!

915
01:42:24,061 --> 01:42:26,438
What about the land
you promised us?

916
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:29,274
[Crowd]
Yeah! Yeah!

917
01:42:29,316 --> 01:42:31,527
[Deacon]
O ye of little faith.

918
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:33,862
I've had a vision so great...

919
01:42:33,946 --> 01:42:37,324
that as it came to me, I wept.

920
01:42:37,407 --> 01:42:41,537
- And in this splenditudinous
figment of wonder,
- Is that Bone's ride?

921
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:43,705
- Is that blood on the seat?
- I saw...

922
01:42:43,789 --> 01:42:47,626
And you know
what it is that I saw.

923
01:42:47,709 --> 01:42:51,630
I saw... the land.

924

- Horse, that you?
- [Engine Revving]

928
01:43:31,545 --> 01:43:34,673
Look, just bring it in slow,
okay? I don't have all day.

929
01:43:34,756 --> 01:43:38,135
- [Engine Revs]
- Horse!

930
01:43:38,177 --> 01:43:40,679
Just bring it up slow.

931
01:43:41,805 --> 01:43:44,683
I said slow!
[Screams]

932
01:43:49,479 --> 01:43:53,483
Shouldn't be doing that.
You're gonna get in trouble.

933
01:43:53,525 --> 01:43:55,819
Ha. That's right.

934
01:43:55,861 --> 01:43:59,907
You're not afraid. You've got
your pet freak comin' to rescue you.

935
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:04,536
He's not a freak,
and he can take you anytime.

936
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:08,707
He's killed dozens of people, and he
doesn't have any mercy or anything.

937
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:10,918
He even kills little girls.

938
01:44:12,794 --> 01:44:14,379
Haven't we all?

939
01:44:16,465 --> 01:44:18,467
Shit.

940
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:20,719
It's Horse.

941
01:44:22,054 --> 01:44:24,556
- Find him. Find him!
- Come on!

942
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:28,936
- [Crowd Chanting]
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

943
01:44:29,019 --> 01:44:32,689
- Come on.
- Gettin' nervous, aren't you?

944
01:44:36,985 --> 01:44:38,904
I don't get nervous.

945
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:42,741
[Deacon]
And if there's a river, we'll dam it.

946
01:44:42,824 --> 01:44:47,287
And if there's a tree,
we'll ram it.

947
01:44:47,371 --> 01:44:50,499
'Cause I'm talkin' progress here.

948
01:44:50,582 --> 01:44:53,585
Yes, sir. I'm talkin' development.

949
01:44:53,669 --> 01:44:57,714
- [Man] Yeah!
- For we shall suck and savor...

950
01:44:57,756 --> 01:45:02,219
the sweet flavor of Dryland.

951
01:45:02,261 --> 01:45:04,137
- [Crowd Whistling]
- [Enola] Face is all red.

952
01:45:04,221 --> 01:45:09,309
- [Deacon Continues Faintly]
- Helen said with anybody
that has a face that red,

953
01:45:09,393 --> 01:45:11,562
he's had too much sun
or too much to drink.

954
01:45:11,603 --> 01:45:15,732
- All right, that's it.
I'm gonna burn your face.
- Almost time.

955
01:45:15,774 --> 01:45:19,903
- [Clanging]
- What's up?
- We're just talkin' about our friend.

956
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:25,117
- [Doctor] What's his name?
- [Enola] He doesn't have a name.

957
01:45:25,158 --> 01:45:27,786
So death can't find him.

958
01:45:27,828 --> 01:45:29,788
Nah-nah.

959
01:45:33,041 --> 01:45:36,962
Doesn't have a home
or people to care for.

960
01:45:37,045 --> 01:45:39,965
He's not afraid of anything,
men least of all.

961
01:45:40,048 --> 01:45:43,677
He's fast and strong
like a big wind.

962
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:46,972
He can hear a hundred miles
and see a hundred miles underwater.

963
01:45:47,055 --> 01:45:51,101
- [Gagging]
- He can hide in the shadow
of the noon sun.

964
01:45:51,143 --> 01:45:55,063
He could be right behind you, and you
won't even know it 'til you're dead!

965
01:45:57,649 --> 01:45:59,651
Give it a rest.

966
01:46:00,944 --> 01:46:02,988
He'll come for me. He will.

967
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:05,657
- [Deacon Addressing Crowd]
We are the people...
- Yeah?

968
01:46:05,699 --> 01:46:09,161
- Well, I hope he does.
- [Deacon] The Lord's creation.

969
01:46:10,454 --> 01:46:12,372
Remember you said that.

970
01:46:13,498 --> 01:46:16,293
[Deacon Continues]
Look at us.

971
01:46:16,335 --> 01:46:19,004
- Look at us here today.
- [Man] Yeah!

972
01:46:19,046 --> 01:46:22,674
Dryland is not just
our destination,

973
01:46:22,758 --> 01:46:24,843
but it is our destiny!

974
01:46:24,927 --> 01:46:27,221
[Cheering, Whistling]

975
01:46:34,228 --> 01:46:36,688
Find him. Find him!

976
01:46:36,772 --> 01:46:38,941
How can I find...

977
01:46:39,024 --> 01:46:41,151
this glorious place?

978
01:46:42,194 --> 01:46:45,030
And he said to me:

979
01:46:45,072 --> 01:46:49,034
"A child shall lead you."

980
01:46:50,536 --> 01:46:52,663
A child.

981
01:46:52,704 --> 01:46:55,040
- And behold!
- It's time.

982
01:46:55,082 --> 01:46:58,168
The instrument of our salvation!

984
01:47:05,676 --> 01:47:08,095

[Deacon]
Our beacon in the darkness.

986
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:12,558
Turn her around, Nord.

987
01:47:12,641 --> 01:47:15,435
She has shown me the path!

[Cheering]

989
01:47:19,898 --> 01:47:23,402
And before the holy-most moment
is upon us,

990
01:47:23,443 --> 01:47:26,905
let's sacrifice one
to old Saint Joe.

991
01:47:30,075 --> 01:47:33,704
And let's get this
tub of shit up to speed.

992
01:47:39,751 --> 01:47:41,753
Yep.

993
01:47:49,428 --> 01:47:52,347
[Wild Cheering]

994
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:21,668
Pull!

995
01:48:21,752 --> 01:48:24,421
- Pull!
- Pull!

996
01:48:24,463 --> 01:48:26,632
- Pull.
- Pull!

997
01:48:41,146 --> 01:48:43,065
Ow.

998
01:48:46,610 --> 01:48:49,905
- So which way we rowin'?
- I don't have a goddamn clue.

999
01:48:49,988 --> 01:48:51,907
[Laughs]
Don't worry.

1000
01:48:51,990 --> 01:48:54,952
They'll row for a month
before they figure out I'm fakin' it.

1001
01:48:54,993 --> 01:48:57,663
But, um, wh-wh...

1002
01:48:57,746 --> 01:49:00,874
Oh, you want details.
Well, I'm not tellin' these savages...

1003
01:49:00,958 --> 01:49:03,168
that we haven't
solved the map yet.

1004
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:08,632
I promised them results,
and I'll get 'em if I gotta
cut 'em out of her goddamn back.

1005
01:49:10,092 --> 01:49:13,470
Who is that?
Who is that?

1006
01:49:14,555 --> 01:49:17,015
Maybe one of
the spare rowers?

1007
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:27,693
Why aren't you rowin'?

1008
01:49:36,243 --> 01:49:38,370
- It's him.
- It is him.

1009
01:49:39,746 --> 01:49:42,416
You guys are in
so much trouble.

1010
01:49:45,252 --> 01:49:49,631
Well, I'll be damned.
It's the gentleman guppy.

1011
01:49:49,715 --> 01:49:53,510
You know, he's like
a turd that won't flush.

1012
01:49:53,552 --> 01:49:56,221
I want the girl.

1013
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:03,812
You know, I thought you
were stupid, friend.

1014
01:50:03,896 --> 01:50:06,815
- [Gun Cocking]
- But I underestimated you.

1015
01:50:06,899 --> 01:50:09,902
You're a total freakin' retard.

1016
01:50:09,985 --> 01:50:13,071
[Laughing]

1017
01:50:13,113 --> 01:50:16,366
I want the girl. That's all.

1018
01:50:16,408 --> 01:50:21,246
Well, what on this screwed-up Earth
makes you think you're gonna get her?

1019
01:50:29,505 --> 01:50:31,423
You know what this is?

1020
01:50:35,761 --> 01:50:38,263
I drop it, you burn.

1021
01:50:38,347 --> 01:50:42,267
- We all burn.
- Now wait, wait, wait, wait.

1022
01:50:42,309 --> 01:50:46,146
Ahem. Let's not do
anything rash here.

1023
01:50:46,230 --> 01:50:49,441
I mean, uh, are you sure
she's worth all this?

1024
01:50:49,483 --> 01:50:52,653
She never does stop talkin'.
She never shuts up.

1025
01:50:52,736 --> 01:50:55,072
- I noticed.
- What is it then?

1026
01:50:55,113 --> 01:50:57,449
Huh? It's the map.

1027
01:50:58,951 --> 01:51:01,745
She's my friend.

1028

Golly gee.
A single tear rolls down my cheek.

1029
01:51:04,623 --> 01:51:07,584
I mean, you're gonna
die for your friend.

1030
01:51:08,961 --> 01:51:10,921
If it comes to that.

1031
01:51:13,215 --> 01:51:17,636
- He's bluffing. I'll kill him.
- He's not bluffing. He never bluffs.

1032
01:51:17,719 --> 01:51:18,929
Shut up!

1033
01:51:20,264 --> 01:51:25,435
I don't... l-l... I don't think
you're gonna drop that torch, my friend.

1034
01:51:25,477 --> 01:51:29,147
- Why not?
- Because you're not crazy.

1035
01:51:32,693 --> 01:51:35,487
No!

1036
01:51:42,452 --> 01:51:45,163

- [Screaming]
- Don't just stand there!
Kill somethin'!

1043
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:20,449

[Screaming]

1045
01:52:29,166 --> 01:52:33,086
Oh, yeah! I've always wanted
to drive this monster.

1046
01:52:36,381 --> 01:52:39,551
There he is!
There he is!

1047
01:52:42,638 --> 01:52:45,015

You're lucky I do.

[Helen]
It's going down.

1067
01:55:23,006 --> 01:55:28,220
- You can see it sinking.
- Gregor, bring us
right down on top of it.

1068
01:55:28,262 --> 01:55:30,430
- Hurry, Gregor!
- [Gregor] Don't worry.

1069
01:55:30,514 --> 01:55:32,432
Hurry.

North is south.
- What?

1096
01:58:29,026 --> 01:58:32,404
- South is north.
- I was swimming.

1097

- I saw.
- [Gregor] My friends.

1098

My friends, look.

1099
01:58:36,909 --> 01:58:41,747
If I take a bearing from the sun and
reverse the coordinates on Enola's back,

1100

then Dryland is that way!

I found something!

1109
02:01:25,244 --> 02:01:28,872
Maybe we should put them
under the dirt.

1110
02:01:28,914 --> 02:01:30,874
I think it was their way.

1111
02:01:33,126 --> 02:01:35,087

they were dying.

First time in your life
you got nothin' to say?

Enola, I have to go now.

1123

Why are you leaving?

02:04:17,666 --> 02:04:21,336
- I don't belong here.
I belong out there.
- You belong here.

1127
02:04:24,673 --> 02:04:27,551
It's too strange here.
It doesn't move right.

1128
02:04:27,593 --> 02:04:30,429
Helen said that
it's only land sickness.

1129
02:04:31,680 --> 02:04:35,225
We're all feeling it.
It'll go away soon.

1130
02:04:35,267 --> 02:04:37,227
It's more than that.
