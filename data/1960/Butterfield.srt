1
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:19,832
Liggett.

2
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,630
Liggett?

3
00:02:29,612 --> 00:02:32,080
- Good morning, Mr. Liggett.
- Morning.

4
00:09:35,203 --> 00:09:38,536
Butterfield 8? Hi, it's Gloria.
Any messages?

5
00:09:39,608 --> 00:09:40,734
Johnny.

6
00:09:41,176 --> 00:09:42,108
George.

7
00:09:42,844 --> 00:09:44,243
Listen...

8
00:09:44,646 --> 00:09:49,106
...a Mr. Liggett will call sometime
today. He might use Mr. L.

9
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:51,114
Find me wherever I am.

10
00:09:51,553 --> 00:09:55,319
This is one call I want to take
personally and immediately.

11
00:09:55,524 --> 00:09:57,253
Okay, bye-bye.

12
00:10:34,463 --> 00:10:35,691
Taxi!

13
00:10:40,135 --> 00:10:43,935
38 Horatio Street, please.
Double your tip for a cigarette.

14
00:10:49,277 --> 00:10:51,677
What's the matter, you crazy?

15
00:10:55,383 --> 00:10:57,510
You're in good voice this morning.

16
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:45,263
I'm from the Census Bureau.

17
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:48,296
Good morning.

18
00:11:49,237 --> 00:11:51,398
How many persons
do you have living here?

19
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,307
Just one. Me.

20
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:56,238
Well, that's not nearly enough.

21
00:11:57,646 --> 00:11:59,978
- You working?
- Trying to.

22
00:12:00,182 --> 00:12:01,706
Tomorrow's arrangements.

23
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:04,542
Tribute.

24
00:12:05,086 --> 00:12:08,681
- To what?
- Your faith, hope and charity.

25
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:12,122
Sunday morning and scotch
on your breath?

26
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:14,420
Well, it's good scotch.
Twenty years old.

27
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:15,618
And cigar smoke?

28
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:18,789
I always said I'd try anything once.

29
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:20,691
Ever try common sense?

30
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:22,927
Only in desperation.

31
00:12:29,878 --> 00:12:32,278
Notice anything unusual
about me this morning?

32
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,004
I wish I could.

33
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:37,214
Look.

34
00:12:42,591 --> 00:12:43,888
Well, look!

35
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,956
You're panting to tell me
where you got it.

36
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,761
I stole it.

37
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:51,899
Sure you did. It figures.

38
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,434
Oh, not for real. Just long enough
to get even with somebody.

39
00:12:56,638 --> 00:12:58,196
Even for what?

40
00:12:58,406 --> 00:13:00,237
Somebody made me so damn mad.

41
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,102
He left me money.
He actually left me money.

42
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:13,917
- What would you have done?
- I don't know.

43
00:13:14,122 --> 00:13:16,852
My work is designed so people
will leave me money.

44
00:13:18,126 --> 00:13:19,957
This wasn't work.

45
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,564
Besides, my dress was torn.

46
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:27,164
I had nothing to wear...

47
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:30,529
...so I borrowed something
spiteful and elegant.

48
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:34,605
Liggett.

49
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:37,209
Weston Ansbury Liggett.

50
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:42,579
- Do you know him?
- Heard of him. He's very social.

51
00:13:42,784 --> 00:13:44,411
And very Yale.

52
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:47,315
What's with you and Yale?
Always Yale.

53
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:50,013
- It's the last college left.
- Why?

54
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:55,591
I started with Amherst, and I worked
my way through the alphabet to Yale.

55
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:57,230
I'm stuck there.

56
00:13:59,067 --> 00:14:01,501
Of course, I could work
backwards again.

57
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:04,562
Did he tell you about his wife?

58
00:14:04,873 --> 00:14:06,534
- IHilljoy.
- I hear he's a lush.

59
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:09,969
A rumor of little mind.

60
00:14:10,578 --> 00:14:12,273
We did have a drink last night.

61
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,278
- One?
- A dozen maybe.

62
00:14:15,483 --> 00:14:18,975
And this morning you stagger
out of his apartment. Charming.

63
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:24,221
Funny thing, I don't even
remember going there.

64
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:28,587
Better than sleeping pills.

65
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:34,868
Can I help with anything?

66
00:14:48,983 --> 00:14:50,951
Could I help you with anything?

67
00:14:52,754 --> 00:14:53,948
Housework?

68
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:59,092
You put that coat back on.

69
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:01,290
Why?

70
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:05,291
Half-dressed women make it
difficult to concentrate.

71
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,297
Well, then don't.

72
00:15:13,308 --> 00:15:15,503
Don't think of me as a woman.

73
00:15:16,578 --> 00:15:19,308
After all, we're just
like brother and sister.

74
00:15:19,514 --> 00:15:20,640
Remember?

75
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:28,450
You're mad at me this morning.

76
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:30,419
Put the coat on!

77
00:15:36,865 --> 00:15:38,298
Why this morning?

78
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:43,300
Because I'm sick of seeing you
boozed up, burned out and ugly!

79
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:46,602
Sick for me or sick for you?

80
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:49,276
For you.
For everything you're wasting.

81
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:53,444
Why do you come here like this?

82
00:15:55,617 --> 00:15:57,881
Where have I always come, Steve?

83
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:02,145
At least I can be honest with you.

84
00:16:03,825 --> 00:16:05,622
Start being honest with yourself.

85
00:16:05,827 --> 00:16:09,388
You're making a mess out of your life
and forcing me to watch it.

86
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,463
- Do you want me to go?
- Yes!

87
00:16:14,803 --> 00:16:16,293
- For good?
- Yes!

88
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:24,845
No.

89
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:41,023
It's terrible, isn't it?

90
00:16:41,963 --> 00:16:45,228
I say "yes" too much when I shouldn't.

91
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,964
And you say "no" too much
when you shouldn't.

92
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:53,301
But you're not nearly as mad
as you pretend to be.

93
00:16:53,942 --> 00:16:55,239
I try to be.

94
00:16:59,848 --> 00:17:00,678
Hungry?

95
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:03,850
Ravenous.

96
00:17:11,826 --> 00:17:14,590
Now, the problem is,
how do I get home?

97
00:17:14,963 --> 00:17:16,954
Car's outside. You drive.

98
00:17:18,266 --> 00:17:21,167
- By the way, thanks for the use of it.
- Anytime.

99
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:26,973
What I mean is, what's my mother gonna
think if I show up dressed like this?

100
00:17:27,175 --> 00:17:29,200
Your mother knows everything
about you.

101
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,605
That may be so,
but we never admit it.

102
00:17:32,347 --> 00:17:34,838
I'm still her innocent little girl.

103
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:38,382
And she's my dear, sweet
cookie-baking mother.

104
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:42,647
So go home, give her an innocent
smile and have a cookie.

105
00:17:43,658 --> 00:17:44,920
And tell her the truth.

106
00:17:45,126 --> 00:17:47,424
If I tell her the truth,
I'll have to move out.

107
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:51,294
That's what normally happens
when people grow up.

108
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,634
If I left, she'd be lonesome.

109
00:17:54,836 --> 00:17:57,828
I'm all she has, so we have
to lie to each other.

110
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:00,667
What does your analyst say
about all this?

111
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,901
I only tell Dr. Tredman
what I think he ought to hear.

112
00:18:04,112 --> 00:18:05,943
That's very intelligent.

113
00:18:06,147 --> 00:18:09,344
If I were intelligent,
I wouldn't need a psychiatrist.

114
00:18:10,985 --> 00:18:14,216
Listen, where am I gonna find
a dress to wear on Sunday?

115
00:18:14,422 --> 00:18:15,684
How would I know?

116
00:18:18,293 --> 00:18:21,660
Your girlfriend, Norma,
is almost my size.

117
00:18:21,863 --> 00:18:26,630
You expect me to ask Norma to bring
her clothes over here to put on you?

118
00:18:26,834 --> 00:18:29,325
It would certainly get me
out of a jam.

119
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:31,061
And put me in one.

120
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:35,004
Listen to old Gloria.

121
00:18:35,209 --> 00:18:37,871
The greater the sacrifice
you ask a woman to make...

122
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,071
...the more she knows
you love her. Honestly.

123
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:00,632
He//o?

124
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:04,931
Hello, Norma?

125
00:19:21,522 --> 00:19:22,989
Problems, Liggett?

126
00:19:24,592 --> 00:19:27,220
You haven't said a word
since we left the city.

127
00:19:27,562 --> 00:19:28,494
Bing...

128
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:33,366
...you know three of the most
overrated things in this world?

129
00:19:34,002 --> 00:19:36,630
Home loving, home cooking
and security.

130
00:19:38,373 --> 00:19:40,705
That should be over
the doorway of The Stork Club.

131
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:43,570
It should be over the doorway
of my apartment.

132
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:46,804
Oh, come on, Ligg.
You've got everything.

133
00:19:47,148 --> 00:19:49,343
Lots of people would envy you.

134
00:19:50,218 --> 00:19:51,879
But am I happy?

135
00:19:52,086 --> 00:19:53,713
Obviously not.

136
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,314
Ever wonder why?

137
00:19:58,226 --> 00:19:59,250
I have.

138
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,255
Can you take it from
an old fraternity brother?

139
00:20:07,402 --> 00:20:09,063
You're a heel.

140
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,800
A low-down, rotten heel.

141
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:16,568
Anything doesn't go your way,
anything you can't have, you destroy.

142
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:21,640
I've known you all these years...

143
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:24,875
...and I never realized
you despise me.

144
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:29,216
If I really despised you, I could
never tell you what I think of you.

145
00:20:34,862 --> 00:20:35,886
Tell me.

146
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,894
You married a lovely woman,
and you mistreat her...

147
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,159
...because you blame her
for your life.

148
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:43,633
Drinking, letching and lying.

149
00:20:43,838 --> 00:20:45,601
You won't face the truth.

150
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:50,676
- And what is this so-called truth?
- You find it out yourself.

151
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:53,312
- Tell me.
- It wouldn't be any good.

152
00:20:53,815 --> 00:20:57,046
Go out and earn it the way
everybody else does.

153
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:03,449
The offer is still open.

154
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:08,092
You could come back as a law partner
with me anytime.

155
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:14,430
I wouldn't join
the Foreign Legion with you.

156
00:21:17,572 --> 00:21:18,470
Pull!

157
00:21:21,943 --> 00:21:22,773
Emily.

158
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:24,001
Yes, darling?

159
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:26,174
How's your mother?

160
00:21:26,547 --> 00:21:29,710
She's doing well, thank you.
She's getting much stronger.

161
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:32,181
When are you coming back to town?

162
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:34,445
Soon as I can.

163
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:38,282
- Why? You getting lonesome?
- Sometimes.

164
00:21:39,827 --> 00:21:43,820
The question was more one
of curiosity than passion.

165
00:21:51,372 --> 00:21:52,396
Pull!

166
00:21:57,211 --> 00:21:58,940
I have to get back to town
after lunch.

167
00:22:00,348 --> 00:22:02,680
But I invited the Farleys
for dinner tonight.

168
00:22:02,884 --> 00:22:05,148
My apologies to the Farleys.

169
00:22:05,553 --> 00:22:07,487
Cliff Holbrook's in town.

170
00:22:08,489 --> 00:22:12,585
And the court jester of the chemical
industry has to keep him laughing.

171
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,034
Pull!

172
00:22:27,141 --> 00:22:29,268
As vice president
in charge of nonsense...

173
00:22:29,477 --> 00:22:32,878
...I have to keep a $6 million
customer happy, don't I?

174
00:22:35,783 --> 00:22:38,445
Why don't you send someone
less important in the company?

175
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:41,281
There isn't anybody
less important than me.

176
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,121
Pull!

177
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,428
Darling?

178
00:22:54,035 --> 00:22:56,595
Will you be charming
at the country club today?

179
00:22:56,938 --> 00:23:00,032
I know you're always charming,
but will you be especially so?

180
00:23:00,241 --> 00:23:01,105
Why?

181
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:05,803
I was asked if you'd consider being
elected to the board of governors.

182
00:23:06,013 --> 00:23:09,676
Why me? Nobody on that board
is under 60.

183
00:23:10,785 --> 00:23:14,050
Isn't that where aging,
useless executives go to die?

184
00:23:14,255 --> 00:23:16,723
Maybe they want to get
some young blood on it.

185
00:23:16,924 --> 00:23:21,452
Or maybe they see me as just
another aging, useless executive.

186
00:23:21,662 --> 00:23:24,096
Why do you say such cruel
things about yourself?

187
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:27,392
To beat everybody, including you,
to the punch.

188
00:23:28,402 --> 00:23:29,300
Pull!

189
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:40,503
Somebody at the cleaners
seems to have left a pin in it.

190
00:23:40,748 --> 00:23:43,239
I know how embarrassed you must be.

191
00:23:43,451 --> 00:23:45,078
I'll speak to them.

192
00:23:45,286 --> 00:23:47,754
Really, this is terribly sweet of you.

193
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:52,719
Just remember that suit has led
a sheltered life. It shocks easily.

194
00:23:54,061 --> 00:23:56,962
Then it's time it had
a little adventure.

195
00:23:57,765 --> 00:24:02,668
By the way, just for the record,
what did happen to your dress?

196
00:24:03,037 --> 00:24:06,495
Well, it's a funny thing.
One minute it was there...

197
00:24:06,707 --> 00:24:08,368
...and the next minute
it wasn't.

198
00:24:08,576 --> 00:24:11,477
Much like your virtue, I presume.

199
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,311
Am I wrong?

200
00:24:14,515 --> 00:24:15,573
Somehow...

201
00:24:15,783 --> 00:24:19,014
...I get the feeling
that you don't like me.

202
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,446
And I tried so hard to conceal it.

203
00:24:23,724 --> 00:24:25,157
Why?

204
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:27,327
You're Steve's girl.

205
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,098
I'm just an old friend.

206
00:24:31,565 --> 00:24:33,965
Well, listen, old friend,
it's about time...

207
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:35,032
Are you decent?

208
00:24:35,236 --> 00:24:36,396
I am.

209
00:24:36,804 --> 00:24:38,863
You can speak for yourself.

210
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:41,265
Come on in.

211
00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:50,810
I hate to drink and run.

212
00:24:51,285 --> 00:24:52,718
To the three of us.

213
00:24:53,621 --> 00:24:55,418
One for all, and all for one.

214
00:24:55,623 --> 00:24:57,921
The question is, which one?

215
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:03,359
Where are the keys to my car?

216
00:25:04,432 --> 00:25:05,922
Right there, on the mantel.

217
00:25:06,133 --> 00:25:09,261
Oh, darling, don't forget
to feed junior regularly.

218
00:25:14,108 --> 00:25:15,302
Bye, now.

219
00:25:26,988 --> 00:25:29,582
- What're we gonna do?
- About what?

220
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:32,255
Me. You. Her.

221
00:25:32,493 --> 00:25:34,757
Three mixed-up musketeers.

222
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:36,520
I don't understand.

223
00:25:36,797 --> 00:25:39,061
How are you fixed for honesty?

224
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,734
Do you know how old I am?

225
00:25:42,103 --> 00:25:43,434
Twenty-seven.

226
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:47,563
How long have we been,
what they call, going together?

227
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:48,764
Three years.

228
00:25:48,976 --> 00:25:50,807
And four months.

229
00:25:51,078 --> 00:25:55,845
It's a lot of time to put in on
a man who can't make up his mind.

230
00:25:57,151 --> 00:26:00,643
- What are you talking about, marriage?
- I didn't say that.

231
00:26:00,921 --> 00:26:03,583
But it's Gloria or me.

232
00:26:04,225 --> 00:26:06,716
Are you telling me
who I can have for friends?

233
00:26:06,927 --> 00:26:11,159
I'm only telling you that you can't
kiss me, wishing I were Gloria anymore.

234
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:14,493
- That's the stupidest...
- Call me when you make up your mind.

235
00:26:14,702 --> 00:26:16,602
Shall we set a deadline?
New Year's Eve?

236
00:26:16,804 --> 00:26:17,668
Wait a minute!

237
00:26:17,872 --> 00:26:21,000
Let me get this straight.
You're handing me an ultimatum?

238
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,210
The first ultimatum
is always the hardest.

239
00:26:25,413 --> 00:26:27,040
Goodbye and good luck.

240
00:26:27,381 --> 00:26:28,905
Gloria, don't go like this.

241
00:26:31,585 --> 00:26:33,450
My name is Norma.

242
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:53,205
Here's Gloria now.

243
00:26:53,474 --> 00:26:55,965
From where? Girl Scout camp?

244
00:26:57,545 --> 00:26:59,342
Do I look all right?

245
00:26:59,847 --> 00:27:01,610
Do you have to?

246
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:13,192
- Hi, girls!
- Oh, darling!

247
00:27:16,964 --> 00:27:19,228
You're getting circles
under your eyes.

248
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:21,264
Too much reading.

249
00:27:21,469 --> 00:27:22,868
Dear Mrs. Thurber.

250
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,765
How's church?

251
00:27:24,972 --> 00:27:27,770
Why don't you go sometime
and find out?

252
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:29,904
Coffee. Just what I need.

253
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:31,169
Not bad.

254
00:27:31,378 --> 00:27:34,870
Now, Frances, you know Gloria's
always been a big coffee drinker...

255
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:36,674
...ever since she was little.

256
00:27:36,884 --> 00:27:39,284
That's a perfectly lovely suit, dear.

257
00:27:39,487 --> 00:27:41,318
Have I seen it before?

258
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:45,725
I picked it up at the designer's last
week. Had it in the trunk of the car.

259
00:27:46,026 --> 00:27:49,655
Must be hard changing clothes
in one of those foreign car trunks.

260
00:27:50,965 --> 00:27:53,263
The model agency sent some dresses.

261
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:56,698
One of them they want you to wear
to three different places.

262
00:27:56,971 --> 00:28:01,601
The Salvation Army, the public library
and the PTA in Brownsville.

263
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:07,846
Frances, don't joke
about Gloria's work.

264
00:28:08,048 --> 00:28:09,743
It's very important to her.

265
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,418
She's one of the few girls
of her kind in the city.

266
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:16,253
I pass.

267
00:28:17,725 --> 00:28:20,125
Did Butterfield 8 call?

268
00:28:20,327 --> 00:28:21,419
Not today.

269
00:28:24,198 --> 00:28:25,426
Any mail?

270
00:28:27,168 --> 00:28:29,500
Oh, just act like I'm not here.

271
00:28:30,471 --> 00:28:32,530
You mean I haven't been?

272
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,774
There's a card from
the finance company.

273
00:28:35,976 --> 00:28:39,002
You're two weeks late
on your car payments.

274
00:28:39,213 --> 00:28:41,841
Oh, it completely slipped my mind.

275
00:28:42,082 --> 00:28:44,073
Listen, I've only got about $40.

276
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:46,617
Could I borrow the $35
until I'm paid?

277
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,650
Of course, darling.

278
00:28:47,855 --> 00:28:50,153
I don't know what I'd do without you.

279
00:28:51,091 --> 00:28:52,353
Thank you, darling.

280
00:28:52,826 --> 00:28:54,953
I'll go get cleaned up
and do my nails.

281
00:28:55,262 --> 00:28:57,230
Yeah, sharpen them!

282
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:01,061
For you, Mrs. Thurber, I would.

283
00:29:01,402 --> 00:29:04,599
In case you forgot, your room
is the first one on the right.

284
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:05,897
Thank you.

285
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:10,740
Exactly where did you stay last night?

286
00:29:10,945 --> 00:29:13,846
Oh, the penthouse at the YWCA.

287
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:15,774
Oh, Annie.

288
00:29:15,983 --> 00:29:17,951
Please don't tease Gloria.

289
00:29:18,152 --> 00:29:21,178
My daughter and my best friend
should appreciate each other.

290
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:24,050
Mama, don't be upset.

291
00:29:24,258 --> 00:29:26,852
Every time I'm separated
from Mrs. Thurber...

292
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:29,154
...I learn to appreciate her
a little bit more.

293
00:29:29,363 --> 00:29:33,026
I return the sentiment.
Enjoy them in good health.

294
00:29:33,234 --> 00:29:34,792
Thank you, Frances.

295
00:29:35,502 --> 00:29:38,471
I spent the night
with Steve's girlfriend, Norma.

296
00:29:38,672 --> 00:29:40,572
Now isn't that nice?

297
00:29:41,342 --> 00:29:44,106
She knows a boy whose girlfriend
is that unselfish.

298
00:29:44,311 --> 00:29:47,508
That's a girlfriend that won't
have a boyfriend long.

299
00:29:48,249 --> 00:29:50,774
A compliment from you, Mrs. Thurber?

300
00:29:50,985 --> 00:29:52,919
I must have said it wrong.

301
00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:54,915
See you later.

302
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,826
Hello.

303
00:31:07,795 --> 00:31:09,387
He's on the line?

304
00:31:10,264 --> 00:31:12,095
Let me speak to him.

305
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,569
Mr. Liggett, I didn't think you'd
be foolish enough to call today.

306
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:18,999
But since you have...

307
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:26,105
Wow!

308
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:31,075
I haven't heard that since
I was in Marine boot camp.

309
00:31:31,352 --> 00:31:33,343
But you're way out of line, honey.

310
00:31:34,621 --> 00:31:36,987
Okay, no "honey."

311
00:31:37,891 --> 00:31:41,327
I tore your dress last night
and felt I owed you a new one.

312
00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:45,031
After all, only a fool would
offer pennies for a Renoir.

313
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,898
Suppose we meet again
at the o/d trading post?

314
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:51,333
I might be in the neighborhood.

315
00:31:51,805 --> 00:31:53,739
If I am, what time
will you be there?

316
00:31:55,642 --> 00:31:57,200
About 8:30?

317
00:31:58,812 --> 00:32:01,781
I'm getting cold in my skin.
Goodbye.

318
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,184
- IH eep the change, honey.
- Here you are, sir.

319
00:32:11,492 --> 00:32:12,550
Thank you.

320
00:32:21,435 --> 00:32:23,369
May Yale go bankrupt.

321
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,003
That will take a while.

322
00:32:25,205 --> 00:32:26,604
But here's to it.

323
00:32:39,153 --> 00:32:41,121
We didn't talk much last night.

324
00:32:41,321 --> 00:32:42,618
Hardly.

325
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,957
But be grateful for small favors.

326
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,321
I'm sorry about the money.

327
00:32:49,263 --> 00:32:50,628
Forgotten!

328
00:32:51,365 --> 00:32:53,697
Hey, you're with me, kid.
Remember?

329
00:32:54,234 --> 00:32:56,634
By choice, only.

330
00:32:57,004 --> 00:32:58,801
You're all alike, aren't you?

331
00:32:59,006 --> 00:33:00,132
Play tough.

332
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,071
- I'm not like anyone. I'm me.
- That's right.

333
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:06,007
I shouldn't knock it, should I?

334
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:09,173
You know...

335
00:33:10,184 --> 00:33:12,209
...last night you were great company.

336
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,645
I've spent time around and about.

337
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:19,792
I didn't ask for your credits
last night. I don't need them now.

338
00:33:19,993 --> 00:33:23,895
- But you're something different.
- I got the world by the tail.

339
00:33:24,097 --> 00:33:26,190
That's what I wanted to talk
to you about.

340
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:28,566
What do you want?

341
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,169
Just what I'm getting.

342
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:33,669
Oh, now, come on, dollface.

343
00:33:34,174 --> 00:33:36,938
You must go to some very bad plays.

344
00:33:37,678 --> 00:33:38,940
Okay.

345
00:33:41,148 --> 00:33:42,547
Gloria...

346
00:33:44,518 --> 00:33:45,780
Now, look...

347
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,887
...you have a price.

348
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,581
We all have, and I can go pretty high.

349
00:33:54,595 --> 00:33:56,688
So hold out for all you can get.

350
00:33:57,164 --> 00:33:58,893
You may hit it pretty big.

351
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:03,759
On the other hand, if you try for
too much, you may end up with nothing.

352
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:09,475
Good night.

353
00:34:10,377 --> 00:34:12,174
You've got a great act.

354
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:51,248
Go ahead, rub your wrist.

355
00:34:52,085 --> 00:34:53,518
I know it hurts.

356
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:55,721
Not if it killed me.

357
00:34:56,523 --> 00:34:58,855
I wanna take you in my arms
and carry you away.

358
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:01,755
That was a lesson pal,
not a treatment.

359
00:35:01,962 --> 00:35:04,954
I won't talk about money again.
But think.

360
00:35:05,165 --> 00:35:09,602
- A big apartment, charge accounts...
- Mr. Liggett...

361
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:13,864
...put your assets away.
You don't have enough.

362
00:35:14,074 --> 00:35:15,200
Try me.

363
00:35:16,677 --> 00:35:20,169
You couldn't match what
I've already turned down.

364
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,712
180-foot yacht in the French Riviera.

365
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:25,908
Van Goghs in every room,
genuine-type Van Goghs.

366
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:28,553
Paid for by this man
with pocket money.

367
00:35:28,755 --> 00:35:31,553
Annuities for life, jewelry...

368
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:33,951
You turned this down?

369
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:36,595
- Flatly!
- Why?

370
00:35:36,997 --> 00:35:39,261
I earn my living...

371
00:35:39,466 --> 00:35:41,832
...modeling clothes like this.

372
00:35:42,035 --> 00:35:43,593
I wish I had a tape recorder.

373
00:35:43,804 --> 00:35:46,932
Command performances
leave me quite cold.

374
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,574
I've had more fun
in the back of a '39 Ford...

375
00:35:49,776 --> 00:35:52,438
...than I ever would inside
the Chase National Bank.

376
00:35:54,414 --> 00:35:56,177
Now I get it.

377
00:35:56,817 --> 00:35:58,546
You pick the man.

378
00:35:58,785 --> 00:35:59,774
He doesn't pick you.

379
00:36:01,355 --> 00:36:03,289
Finally!

380
00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:06,856
Why I'm not teaching logic
at Columbia, I'll never know.

381
00:36:07,527 --> 00:36:08,789
One moment.

382
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:11,097
Postgraduate course.

383
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:14,197
You also drop the man
when you want to?

384
00:36:16,169 --> 00:36:18,637
And without a parachute.

385
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:21,170
Oh, I'm with you, kid.

386
00:36:21,575 --> 00:36:24,237
And very grateful to be
up there for the trip.

387
00:36:24,444 --> 00:36:27,436
That's the first nice thing
you've said since I met you.

388
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:32,847
Drink up before you're
too busy to reach for it.

389
00:36:35,188 --> 00:36:37,156
And then it's...

390
00:36:37,357 --> 00:36:41,691
...go, go, go.
- Slowly, friend.

391
00:36:42,062 --> 00:36:43,927
I have work to do.

392
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:45,762
Namely?

393
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,667
I have three elegant bistros...

394
00:36:49,936 --> 00:36:53,428
...where I'm obliged to be
photographed in this dress.

395
00:36:54,341 --> 00:36:58,107
Besides, you'll enjoy seeing
my good side first.

396
00:36:59,246 --> 00:37:01,771
This time, let's take my car.

397
00:37:02,816 --> 00:37:05,341
You mean the one with
that crazy back seat?

398
00:37:06,887 --> 00:37:08,377
The same.

399
00:38:07,314 --> 00:38:09,111
Excuse me, darling.
I'll be back.

400
00:38:09,316 --> 00:38:10,681
Gloria.

401
00:38:10,884 --> 00:38:12,909
I called you three times today.

402
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,782
I sent you a telegram.
I guess you didn't get it.

403
00:38:17,758 --> 00:38:19,453
I think I'm getting it now.

404
00:38:20,193 --> 00:38:24,186
I've got some fellows from New Haven
over there, and you're what we need.

405
00:38:24,397 --> 00:38:29,232
Yeah. But you see, I'm working.
And besides, I'm with somebody.

406
00:38:29,903 --> 00:38:32,303
I see. Aren't you Weston Liggett?

407
00:38:32,506 --> 00:38:34,599
No, I'm Whistler's father.

408
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:39,144
There's nothing I love better
than a great kidder.

409
00:38:39,346 --> 00:38:41,712
Oh, it's a lost art.

410
00:38:41,915 --> 00:38:44,008
But he's one of the greatest.

411
00:38:49,055 --> 00:38:51,250
El Morocco's right around this corner.

412
00:38:52,926 --> 00:38:55,121
You drove right by it!

413
00:38:55,595 --> 00:38:56,721
That's right.

414
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,595
Now, look!

415
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:00,289
Now, you look.

416
00:39:00,734 --> 00:39:02,964
I'm tired of looking and listening.

417
00:39:03,203 --> 00:39:05,296
Nobody treats me like this.

418
00:39:05,505 --> 00:39:09,168
Oh, you mean big Weston Liggett,
the wealthy.

419
00:39:09,376 --> 00:39:11,970
I mean, me.
Weston Liggett, the man.

420
00:39:13,446 --> 00:39:17,007
- There was such a person?
- In spades, honey.

421
00:39:17,217 --> 00:39:19,447
I wasn't cut out to be a chauffeur...

422
00:39:19,786 --> 00:39:21,549
...a rented escort...

423
00:39:22,355 --> 00:39:24,755
...a straight man for your
nightclub repartee.

424
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:28,519
Now, you mustn't run yourself
down like that.

425
00:39:28,728 --> 00:39:31,595
And the next time you
get angry, sweetheart...

426
00:39:31,798 --> 00:39:35,529
...just remember, you sent for me.
I didn't send for you.

427
00:39:41,675 --> 00:39:43,734
Take one of these out
for me, will you?

428
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:08,361
Like hell, you didn't send for me.

429
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,970
Now what?

430
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:17,342
Are you going to drag me off
to your cave?

431
00:40:17,611 --> 00:40:20,045
My apartment is three minutes away.

432
00:40:20,247 --> 00:40:21,373
Oh, no.

433
00:40:21,581 --> 00:40:24,607
Not your apartment.
Absolutely not.

434
00:40:25,452 --> 00:40:27,443
It was all right for you last night.

435
00:40:28,421 --> 00:40:32,881
But last night my sense of direction
was slightly impaired by gin.

436
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,996
Okay, I've got caves
all over the place.

437
00:40:39,966 --> 00:40:42,867
You can straighten up now.
We've made the curve.

438
00:40:43,236 --> 00:40:44,999
But I don't want to.

439
00:40:47,774 --> 00:40:48,934
Hello.

440
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,304
Hello.

441
00:41:15,435 --> 00:41:18,029
Happy? Happy!

442
00:41:19,172 --> 00:41:20,503
Good evening!

443
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:22,574
Good evening.

444
00:41:23,209 --> 00:41:25,268
- Good evening.
- Lf it isn't Mr. Liggett.

445
00:41:25,478 --> 00:41:26,775
I see you're all filled up.

446
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,108
Oh, well, I wouldn't be Happy
if I wasn't.

447
00:41:34,054 --> 00:41:36,887
We always have room
for two more weary travelers.

448
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,819
If you'll excuse me,
I need rest.

449
00:41:39,025 --> 00:41:40,993
Oh, sure.
I know, I know.

450
00:41:41,494 --> 00:41:44,088
Hey, I've got a new joke for you!

451
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:47,528
- It's crazy and there's some words...
- Now, please!

452
00:41:47,734 --> 00:41:52,103
- But there were these two old maids...
- Some other time. Later.

453
00:41:52,305 --> 00:41:55,900
A man's got to get his rest.
He's got to get it regular.

454
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:00,541
Honey, there was a time
I could've worn that coat.

455
00:42:00,747 --> 00:42:05,309
- Happy was in vaudeville once.
- In vaudeville? I was vaudeville.

456
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:08,587
You should see my scrapbooks!

457
00:42:52,232 --> 00:42:55,395
You're liable to end up
psychologically famous.

458
00:42:55,602 --> 00:42:57,934
A case history in a medical book.

459
00:42:58,204 --> 00:43:00,604
- You writing it?
- No.

460
00:43:01,141 --> 00:43:05,237
But I tell my psychiatrist everything.
Even down to the smallest...

461
00:43:05,445 --> 00:43:07,174
...darkest details.

462
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,780
That's a set of notes
I'd like to read.

463
00:43:11,351 --> 00:43:13,649
But why do you need a psychiatrist?

464
00:43:13,853 --> 00:43:17,311
I've never met anyone as direct
and uninhibited as you.

465
00:43:18,258 --> 00:43:21,921
You know that Latin motto,
sic transit g/oria?

466
00:43:23,129 --> 00:43:26,690
I'm the g/oria, and in my case
the sic is for real sick.

467
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,336
I'm not too sure about the transit.
I think it's about my car.

468
00:43:36,242 --> 00:43:37,539
Gloria...

469
00:43:39,145 --> 00:43:40,339
You're wonderful.

470
00:43:41,181 --> 00:43:42,910
"Wild" is the word.

471
00:43:43,383 --> 00:43:46,511
First genuine wildness
I've come across in a woman.

472
00:43:47,987 --> 00:43:50,478
Have you stopped to think
that perhaps...

473
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,624
...you bring out the wildness in me?

474
00:43:53,193 --> 00:43:55,286
With you, who has time to think?

475
00:43:55,728 --> 00:43:57,161
Take five.

476
00:43:57,697 --> 00:44:00,325
- Waitress, some more french fries?
- Coming up.

477
00:44:05,805 --> 00:44:07,830
Gloria, where do we go from here?

478
00:44:08,341 --> 00:44:10,036
That's a good question.

479
00:44:11,177 --> 00:44:14,476
Why don't we go on a long trip
to faraway places...

480
00:44:14,681 --> 00:44:16,273
...exploring?

481
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:18,244
Exploring what?

482
00:44:18,718 --> 00:44:20,049
What else?

483
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,951
Each other.

484
00:44:25,325 --> 00:44:26,917
Here's the overture.

485
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,988
Theme.

486
00:44:29,229 --> 00:44:30,594
Where's the theme?

487
00:44:31,731 --> 00:44:32,891
I'll get it.

488
00:44:34,868 --> 00:44:38,201
- You're working. I'll drop by later.
- No, come on in.

489
00:44:38,404 --> 00:44:39,803
We've finished.

490
00:44:40,707 --> 00:44:41,969
Sit down.

491
00:44:42,609 --> 00:44:45,601
I'll have the last 16 bars
and the tag for you tomorrow.

492
00:44:45,812 --> 00:44:48,144
- About noon.
- See you, Steve.

493
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:51,680
Now...

494
00:44:53,253 --> 00:44:55,221
I found your message and came over.

495
00:44:55,555 --> 00:44:58,080
I wanted to thank you
for the birthday gift.

496
00:44:58,992 --> 00:45:02,120
It was ordered a long time ago.
They sent it automatically.

497
00:45:02,328 --> 00:45:04,421
And a few days early at that.

498
00:45:06,566 --> 00:45:08,227
I've missed seeing you.

499
00:45:09,035 --> 00:45:11,833
- This place is a wreck.
- I guess so.

500
00:45:12,038 --> 00:45:15,235
I've been busy.
Here, let me take your coat.

501
00:45:18,578 --> 00:45:19,704
Thank you.

502
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:35,256
- The story of my life.
- What is?

503
00:45:35,562 --> 00:45:39,658
My simple cloth coat hanging
in your closet, next to Gloria's mink.

504
00:45:39,866 --> 00:45:42,733
- At least mine's paid for.
- This is not her coat.

505
00:45:42,936 --> 00:45:44,494
She borrowed it.

506
00:45:45,104 --> 00:45:46,503
I don't know where she is.

507
00:45:46,706 --> 00:45:49,903
I've been calling Butterfield 8.
They don't know either.

508
00:45:50,109 --> 00:45:51,098
- I do.
- Where?

509
00:45:51,578 --> 00:45:54,274
She's way out in another world.

510
00:45:55,481 --> 00:45:57,278
Give me my coat.
I'll be on my way.

511
00:45:57,483 --> 00:46:00,043
- You just got here.
- It was a mistake.

512
00:46:00,253 --> 00:46:02,744
- Norma.
- I thought when I found your message...

513
00:46:02,956 --> 00:46:06,585
...that you'd made up your mind,
but you haven't. No, thanks!

514
00:46:06,793 --> 00:46:08,693
- Norma, sit down.
- I don't want to.

515
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:11,090
Norma, sit down and listen.

516
00:46:12,899 --> 00:46:16,357
Every time we see each other,
we fight about Gloria.

517
00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:18,230
Without raising our voices...

518
00:46:18,438 --> 00:46:21,168
...let me explain Gloria
to you once and for all.

519
00:46:21,374 --> 00:46:22,671
That's quite a job.

520
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:26,140
We grew up in the same area.
I've known her all my life.

521
00:46:26,346 --> 00:46:27,779
We went to the same school.

522
00:46:28,147 --> 00:46:31,310
Her father died when she was little.
Her mother went to work.

523
00:46:32,085 --> 00:46:35,213
So I sort of became her family.

524
00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:38,313
I have to look after her.

525
00:46:38,725 --> 00:46:40,750
I'm gonna do it for
as long as it takes.

526
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,689
Will you try to understand?

527
00:46:42,996 --> 00:46:44,861
- I understand.
- I knew you would.

528
00:46:45,064 --> 00:46:48,090
I understand that it's
much worse than I thought.

529
00:46:48,301 --> 00:46:51,566
You're in love with her,
and you don't even know it.

530
00:46:53,006 --> 00:46:54,473
Steve...

531
00:46:54,674 --> 00:46:58,041
...is she not a tramp?
- I never liked that word.

532
00:46:58,244 --> 00:47:02,874
- She's the biggest tramp in the city.
- I don't like to hear you use it.

533
00:47:03,082 --> 00:47:05,880
Suppose you make up your mind
to marry me someday?

534
00:47:06,085 --> 00:47:10,215
We marry and have kids. Do you want
her hanging around, babysitting?

535
00:47:10,423 --> 00:47:13,790
Nipping brandy in the morning
and telling them the story...

536
00:47:13,993 --> 00:47:17,622
...of Red Riding Hood and the
Three Lecherous Bears in a hotel?

537
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:20,993
Do we keep a room where
she can sleep off her hangovers?

538
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,193
- All I know is, I worry about her.
- But does she worry about you?

539
00:47:25,405 --> 00:47:27,396
- Does she?!
- I don't know or care!

540
00:47:27,607 --> 00:47:30,906
This is something I'm gonna do
whether you like it or not!

541
00:47:42,822 --> 00:47:44,289
Steve...

542
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:46,549
...I withdraw my ultimatum.

543
00:47:46,759 --> 00:47:49,990
This fight is far too important
for me to run away.

544
00:47:53,866 --> 00:47:55,595
If I'm going to lose...

545
00:47:55,802 --> 00:47:59,135
...it's only gonna be because
I'm thoroughly beaten.

546
00:48:05,778 --> 00:48:08,212
If you don't kiss me,
I'm going to kiss you.

547
00:48:34,207 --> 00:48:35,902
That's where I was born.

548
00:48:41,814 --> 00:48:45,306
- Right behind that window up there.
- It's not what I pictured.

549
00:48:45,752 --> 00:48:48,084
It isn't what my mother
pictured either.

550
00:48:48,287 --> 00:48:51,279
We couldn't even afford a doctor.
My father delivered me.

551
00:48:51,491 --> 00:48:56,087
- He must have been a courageous man.
- He was an inventor.

552
00:48:56,529 --> 00:48:58,827
Can you think of
anything more useless...

553
00:48:59,165 --> 00:49:01,190
...in a small town like this?

554
00:49:01,968 --> 00:49:04,630
- Not if he invented a way to get out.
- He did.

555
00:49:04,837 --> 00:49:06,737
Oh, with some gimmick or other.

556
00:49:06,939 --> 00:49:11,137
And he made money. Not a lot,
but enough to set us up comfortably.

557
00:49:11,944 --> 00:49:14,970
He was very proud of me
when I graduated law school.

558
00:49:15,481 --> 00:49:18,177
He was certain I'd go
a long way in this world.

559
00:49:18,384 --> 00:49:20,045
And you did, didn't you?

560
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:24,555
- The head of a big chemical company.
- I'm just another hired hand.

561
00:49:24,757 --> 00:49:27,487
The company belongs
to my wife's family.

562
00:49:31,197 --> 00:49:34,223
My wife is a fact that I can't avoid.

563
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:37,894
She's the center of a spiderweb
of family, money...

564
00:49:38,104 --> 00:49:41,130
...country clubs and time-killing
childish employments.

565
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,103
Fall into it once...

566
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,949
- What will the neighbors think?
- The worst.

567
00:49:51,417 --> 00:49:53,908
You know, that's exactly
what I'm thinking now.

568
00:49:54,754 --> 00:49:56,745
I want to kiss you right here...

569
00:49:56,956 --> 00:50:00,392
...on Chestnut Street at noon
in the worst possible way.

570
00:50:01,527 --> 00:50:04,018
You know, I'm glad
you're in chemicals.

571
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,702
Annie?

572
00:50:19,979 --> 00:50:22,573
- Annie.
- Did you play?

573
00:50:22,782 --> 00:50:24,443
Quite a while ago.

574
00:50:26,986 --> 00:50:28,248
There!

575
00:50:28,521 --> 00:50:30,648
You can't be out of clubs.

576
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:32,580
Well, what did I play?

577
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:37,126
Your heart. And I can hear yours
pounding right across the table.

578
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:39,195
I'm sorry, Franny.

579
00:50:40,233 --> 00:50:41,495
Let's forget the game.

580
00:50:41,701 --> 00:50:45,296
No, no, no. I'll pay attention.
Now, let's play.

581
00:50:46,138 --> 00:50:48,766
I'd rather you put your troubles
on the table.

582
00:50:48,975 --> 00:50:50,840
I don't wanna burden you with them.

583
00:50:51,043 --> 00:50:53,739
So what am I your friend for?
Your money?

584
00:50:53,946 --> 00:50:56,210
Or maybe I want to steal your husband?

585
00:50:58,084 --> 00:51:01,952
You think I don't know you haven't
heard from your daughter in six days?

586
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:07,253
She's never done such a thing
before without calling.

587
00:51:09,896 --> 00:51:11,796
Something terrible
must have happened.

588
00:51:11,998 --> 00:51:15,229
Why does it have to be bad?
Good things happen too.

589
00:51:15,434 --> 00:51:18,767
Frances, you're my best friend, but...

590
00:51:19,338 --> 00:51:21,670
...I can't talk to you, frankly.
- Why not?

591
00:51:21,874 --> 00:51:25,401
There are things you don't know about.
Nobody should.

592
00:51:25,611 --> 00:51:29,638
- Yes, they should!
- Her father died when she was so little.

593
00:51:31,684 --> 00:51:33,481
If only she'd had a wise father...

594
00:51:33,686 --> 00:51:36,814
...and strong enough to keep her
on the right path!

595
00:51:40,092 --> 00:51:42,492
Once, there was a man I almost married.

596
00:51:42,695 --> 00:51:45,391
The major.
Major Hartley?

597
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:50,225
Somehow or other,
Gloria didn't like him.

598
00:51:51,237 --> 00:51:54,035
It might have been good for her
if I had.

599
00:51:54,574 --> 00:51:55,871
Anne.

600
00:51:56,909 --> 00:52:00,140
Gloria's a good girl.
Don't worry about her.

601
00:52:00,346 --> 00:52:03,281
But you always say
such impolite things to her.

602
00:52:03,482 --> 00:52:06,178
I say the same to everybody.
I'm a born critic.

603
00:52:06,552 --> 00:52:09,077
There's bad in everything,
but there's good too.

604
00:52:09,288 --> 00:52:11,882
Her good far outweighs the bad.

605
00:52:12,091 --> 00:52:16,687
If she was that bad, you wouldn't
have heard from her in six years.

606
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:19,620
Do you mind if I kiss you?

607
00:52:19,832 --> 00:52:23,962
You do, and I'll spread an ugly rumor
all around the neighborhood.

608
00:52:50,663 --> 00:52:52,597
She's a real rust bucket.

609
00:52:53,165 --> 00:52:54,655
But she's mine.

610
00:52:54,867 --> 00:52:56,232
A yacht!

611
00:52:56,435 --> 00:53:00,235
- You didn't tell me.
- It doesn't have any Van Goghs in it...

612
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,498
...but I do have two original
copies of P/ayboy magazine.

613
00:53:07,113 --> 00:53:10,549
Let's go aboard and "sail away
for a year and a day...

614
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:14,709
...to the land of the bong trees."
- The Ow/ and the Cat.

615
00:53:15,121 --> 00:53:17,316
Come aboard, mate, and sign on.

616
00:53:22,995 --> 00:53:24,553
But I warn you...

617
00:53:25,131 --> 00:53:28,066
...the crew hasn't seen a woman
for three months.

618
00:53:28,267 --> 00:53:29,791
Crazy.

619
00:53:30,636 --> 00:53:32,797
Where are you bound for, captain?

620
00:53:33,406 --> 00:53:35,135
Out of frustration...

621
00:53:35,508 --> 00:53:37,135
...bound for ecstasy.

622
00:53:37,743 --> 00:53:39,643
I've heard a lot about ecstasy.

623
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:41,745
It's everything they say...

624
00:53:42,381 --> 00:53:44,008
...and more.

625
00:53:51,257 --> 00:53:55,785
If you'd kindly show me to my quarters,
you can lift anchor anytime.

626
00:54:09,675 --> 00:54:10,937
Emily?

627
00:54:11,477 --> 00:54:12,671
Mother!

628
00:54:14,914 --> 00:54:16,074
You should be in bed.

629
00:54:16,282 --> 00:54:19,843
And you should not be in bed.
At least alone.

630
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,950
Now, I can take care of myself.

631
00:54:23,456 --> 00:54:26,084
Which seems to be more
than you can do.

632
00:54:28,027 --> 00:54:30,359
I want to tell you about our family.

633
00:54:30,563 --> 00:54:34,556
- It's 11:00, and I know all about...
- I'll tell you anyway. Sit down.

634
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,267
I want to make a point.

635
00:54:36,469 --> 00:54:37,629
All right.

636
00:54:37,837 --> 00:54:41,034
We've had sacrifice and cowardice...

637
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,265
...honor and infidelity...

638
00:54:43,476 --> 00:54:45,341
...courage, love...

639
00:54:45,544 --> 00:54:49,105
...deception, confusion, brilliance...

640
00:54:49,682 --> 00:54:52,742
...tragedy.
- Why not just bring the dictionary?

641
00:54:52,952 --> 00:54:57,218
You know what we've never had in the
family since its history's been recorded?

642
00:54:57,957 --> 00:54:59,390
Privacy.

643
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,555
There's not one single,
solitary divorce.

644
00:55:06,432 --> 00:55:09,663
It's my opinion, after 150 years,
we've earned...

645
00:55:09,869 --> 00:55:11,700
...a divorce with a clear conscience.

646
00:55:12,037 --> 00:55:14,301
Tomorrow, I want you
to call Mr. Robinson...

647
00:55:14,507 --> 00:55:17,169
...and instruct him to draw up
the necessary papers...

648
00:55:17,376 --> 00:55:19,867
...and to have them served
forthwith on that...

649
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,775
...worthless, absentee husband of yours.

650
00:55:23,015 --> 00:55:26,382
- He is not worthless.
- Then why isn't he with you?

651
00:55:26,585 --> 00:55:29,349
Mother, you were ill.
I wanted to look after you.

652
00:55:29,555 --> 00:55:32,888
You wanted to hide from
unpleasantness and the truth.

653
00:55:33,092 --> 00:55:37,495
Somewhere, at this very minute, he's
probably lifting a glass in a bar...

654
00:55:37,696 --> 00:55:40,028
...or some woman's skirt.
And you know it.

655
00:55:40,232 --> 00:55:41,631
Oh, Mother, don't be vulgar!

656
00:55:41,834 --> 00:55:44,029
Vulgarity has its uses.

657
00:55:44,804 --> 00:55:46,635
Anyway, your marriage is over.

658
00:55:47,439 --> 00:55:49,498
Divorce him without delay...

659
00:55:49,775 --> 00:55:51,800
...and start out fresh.
- No.

660
00:55:52,011 --> 00:55:53,205
Never.

661
00:55:53,412 --> 00:55:57,439
This is not pride speaking,
but because I know Wes is good.

662
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:59,277
- And I love him.
- Oh, nonsense!

663
00:55:59,485 --> 00:56:00,543
Now, Mother...

664
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,048
...you listen to me.

665
00:56:02,254 --> 00:56:05,314
If there's anything wrong with Wes,
we brought it about.

666
00:56:05,524 --> 00:56:06,821
Explain.

667
00:56:07,026 --> 00:56:11,019
Instead of my living his life,
we brought him here to ours.

668
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:13,858
We handed him a gift-wrapped
package and said:

669
00:56:14,066 --> 00:56:17,433
"Here. Here's your life.
Don't bother to live it yourself."

670
00:56:17,636 --> 00:56:21,231
You presented him with a meaningless
job, all title and no work.

671
00:56:21,974 --> 00:56:26,035
He woke up with energy to burn,
and he started burning it.

672
00:56:26,245 --> 00:56:30,875
But in all the wrong directions:
Liquor, women, defiance.

673
00:56:31,584 --> 00:56:34,849
The more he did it, the more
he had to go on to justify it.

674
00:56:35,054 --> 00:56:37,420
You're not running a mission
for lost egos.

675
00:56:37,923 --> 00:56:40,084
Mother, I'm running a marriage.

676
00:56:40,292 --> 00:56:43,819
Not just through the good days,
but through the bad days too.

677
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:46,898
Someday Wes is going to find himself.

678
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:49,624
When he does, I want to be there.

679
00:56:50,202 --> 00:56:51,134
In the meantime?

680
00:56:52,371 --> 00:56:54,236
All I need is patience.

681
00:56:54,874 --> 00:56:56,273
How much have you got left?

682
00:56:58,277 --> 00:56:59,869
I don't know, Mother.

683
00:57:00,546 --> 00:57:02,241
That's what scares me.

684
00:57:02,548 --> 00:57:03,708
I don't know.

685
00:57:11,357 --> 00:57:13,882
You're a magnificent woman, Emily.

686
00:57:14,493 --> 00:57:15,858
Magnificent.

687
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:19,320
But why don't you fight for him?

688
00:57:19,665 --> 00:57:22,828
A knock-down, drag-out kind of fight.

689
00:57:23,035 --> 00:57:26,004
And give him all the more reason
to run away from me?

690
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:32,238
Emily...

691
00:57:34,647 --> 00:57:38,105
...where did you ever learn
all this wisdom?

692
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,554
From you, you fool!

693
00:57:57,036 --> 00:58:00,494
That attaché case, a man would
love that, wouldn't he?

694
00:58:00,706 --> 00:58:01,604
Any man.

695
00:58:01,807 --> 00:58:04,275
Especially if the right woman
gave it to him.

696
00:58:04,476 --> 00:58:07,206
I know the right woman
and the right man.

697
00:58:07,413 --> 00:58:08,903
Let's buy it.

698
00:58:15,721 --> 00:58:16,710
Good morning.

699
00:58:16,922 --> 00:58:19,982
- Good morning.
- I'd like to see that attaché case.

700
00:58:20,192 --> 00:58:22,057
- The one in tan.
- This one?

701
00:58:26,632 --> 00:58:30,398
- Very nice. Can you gift-wrap it?
- Yes, of course.

702
00:58:34,306 --> 00:58:38,003
Would you care to have the initials
put on it in gold?

703
00:58:38,577 --> 00:58:39,407
Excuse me.

704
00:58:40,012 --> 00:58:42,674
- We have a machine that can do it.
- Fine. Thank you.

705
00:58:42,881 --> 00:58:44,405
- What initials, please?
- S.C.

706
00:58:44,616 --> 00:58:47,084
- S.C. Thank you.
- S. C?

707
00:58:47,286 --> 00:58:48,378
Who's S. C?

708
00:58:48,587 --> 00:58:50,145
Steve Carpenter.

709
00:58:50,456 --> 00:58:53,016
- And who's Steve Carpenter?
- A friend of mine.

710
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:54,958
Out of nowhere.

711
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:58,252
Completely out of nowhere
comes a friend called "Steve."

712
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:02,860
It's his birthday.

713
00:59:03,068 --> 00:59:06,003
Every birthday, for 12 years,
I've bought him a present.

714
00:59:06,238 --> 00:59:09,435
Oh, that's grand.
I'm all choked up.

715
00:59:12,711 --> 00:59:13,541
Liggett?

716
00:59:16,749 --> 00:59:19,946
I'm going to have to leave
you today and go see Steve.

717
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:21,850
Now, look.

718
00:59:22,087 --> 00:59:24,783
I know. "You're
with me, kid. Remember?"

719
00:59:26,692 --> 00:59:28,592
Lt'll be only a moment, ma'am.

720
00:59:29,828 --> 00:59:30,658
Oh, clerk?

721
00:59:33,766 --> 00:59:38,135
I'm Gloria Wandrous. I called to see
if something would be ready today.

722
00:59:38,337 --> 00:59:41,033
- Do you know if it is?
- I have it right here.

723
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,238
Miss Wandrous.
Here it is, miss.

724
00:59:44,443 --> 00:59:45,671
Thank you.

725
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:14,130
- Do you mind?
- Go right ahead, sir.

726
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:24,746
Gloria...

727
01:00:25,084 --> 01:00:29,180
...l'm afraid it's your turn
to act like a fool because...

728
01:00:29,555 --> 01:00:31,580
...there's something
I have to tell you.

729
01:00:32,324 --> 01:00:35,623
You act like a man who's expecting
his wife back in town.

730
01:00:36,395 --> 01:00:38,022
How did you know? Today?

731
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:40,195
I always knew.

732
01:00:40,399 --> 01:00:41,423
Someday.

733
01:00:43,969 --> 01:00:46,904
Here I was, trying
to find a way to...

734
01:00:48,207 --> 01:00:51,665
Look, Gloria, I have to spend
at least tonight with her.

735
01:00:53,645 --> 01:00:56,637
A good night's sleep will
be the best thing for you.

736
01:00:58,117 --> 01:01:00,142
I have Steve to keep me warm.

737
01:01:00,352 --> 01:01:02,149
Don't say things like that.

738
01:01:04,123 --> 01:01:07,388
Mr. Liggett, I can hardly wait
for your call tomorrow.

739
01:01:07,593 --> 01:01:09,288
You won't forget the number?

740
01:01:10,062 --> 01:01:10,994
I'll do my best.

741
01:01:13,132 --> 01:01:14,360
And, Liggett...

742
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,629
...thank you for not calling me...

743
01:01:16,835 --> 01:01:19,531
..."honey" and "babe"
and "dollface" anymore.

744
01:01:20,172 --> 01:01:21,639
I couldn't.

745
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:24,566
I don't think of you
like that anymore.

746
01:01:48,033 --> 01:01:49,193
Mama?

747
01:02:06,685 --> 01:02:07,913
Darling.

748
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,587
I've been so worried about you.

749
01:02:09,788 --> 01:02:12,882
I know you have been, darling,
and I'm sorry.

750
01:02:13,158 --> 01:02:14,989
- Are you hungry?
- No.

751
01:02:15,594 --> 01:02:18,290
Mama, I want to tell you
what I've been doing.

752
01:02:18,497 --> 01:02:21,295
- No, dear, you don't have to.
- I do.

753
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:24,859
I've been with a man a whole week.

754
01:02:27,372 --> 01:02:29,897
Let me tell you the truth
for once in my life.

755
01:02:30,642 --> 01:02:33,236
No, please. Please.

756
01:02:33,812 --> 01:02:36,645
We both know what kind
of a girl I've been.

757
01:02:36,848 --> 01:02:40,249
- No, I don't want to hear about it.
- Mama, you have to!

758
01:02:40,452 --> 01:02:44,354
Unless I am honest about yesterday,
how can you believe me today?

759
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:45,420
Believe what?

760
01:02:45,624 --> 01:02:46,955
I'm different!

761
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:48,922
Mama, I am different.

762
01:02:49,127 --> 01:02:52,756
Yesterday, it was men,
a whole world full of men...

763
01:02:52,965 --> 01:02:54,933
Let me go! You're hurting me!

764
01:02:55,133 --> 01:02:56,430
Mama, face it!

765
01:02:56,635 --> 01:02:58,728
I was the slut of all time!

766
01:03:03,709 --> 01:03:07,304
If only you'd done that before.

767
01:03:08,046 --> 01:03:09,308
Long ago...

768
01:03:09,514 --> 01:03:13,678
...every time I came home
all soaked through with gin.

769
01:03:16,855 --> 01:03:18,083
I'm sorry.

770
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:25,988
It's not your fault, Mama.
It never has been.

771
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:28,194
It was in me...

772
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,727
...but it isn't there anymore.

773
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:35,532
It's no longer just men for me.
There's only one man. One.

774
01:03:35,741 --> 01:03:37,208
Just one.

775
01:03:38,744 --> 01:03:41,008
Maybe it's too late for marriage...

776
01:03:42,414 --> 01:03:45,008
...but it's not too late for love.

777
01:03:46,118 --> 01:03:47,483
Now...

778
01:03:48,453 --> 01:03:51,684
...by some miracle,
I'm like everybody else.

779
01:03:52,391 --> 01:03:53,881
I'm in love.

780
01:03:55,427 --> 01:03:57,452
You can look at me, Mama...

781
01:03:58,096 --> 01:04:00,758
...without wishing
I'd never been born.

782
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,474
Hi, Bing.

783
01:04:16,682 --> 01:04:17,979
Hi, Ligg.

784
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:21,543
Well?

785
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:23,915
Is that offer still open?

786
01:04:26,725 --> 01:04:27,953
Yes or no?

787
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,024
So you finally came to your senses.

788
01:04:31,229 --> 01:04:33,561
Well, what brought this on?

789
01:04:33,765 --> 01:04:35,596
Something just woke me up.

790
01:04:37,936 --> 01:04:39,403
I won't ask what it was...

791
01:04:39,604 --> 01:04:42,767
...because I wish it had
happened five years ago.

792
01:04:42,974 --> 01:04:45,499
- You prepared to work hard?
- Harder than you.

793
01:04:45,711 --> 01:04:49,442
We keep regular hours.
Law and liquor don't go together.

794
01:04:49,648 --> 01:04:51,946
It'll take six months
of study to catch up.

795
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:53,742
I'll catch up in three.

796
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:56,553
All right, Ligg, old friend.
Let's go.

797
01:05:02,994 --> 01:05:04,552
She's here, doctor.

798
01:05:06,131 --> 01:05:08,326
Good afternoon, Dr. Tredman.

799
01:05:09,067 --> 01:05:12,434
I don't know if I care to talk
with you, Miss Wandrous.

800
01:05:12,637 --> 01:05:14,298
Then why did you let me in?

801
01:05:14,506 --> 01:05:17,907
Don't try to analyze me.
You don't have the training.

802
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:19,805
Not in books, perhaps.

803
01:05:20,011 --> 01:05:24,345
You missed three sessions in a row,
and you're late for this one.

804
01:05:24,783 --> 01:05:26,876
I have only so much time a day.

805
01:05:27,085 --> 01:05:30,782
If you don't need the time,
there are people who desperately do.

806
01:05:30,989 --> 01:05:34,925
Now, let's get to work
without anymore nonsense.

807
01:05:35,494 --> 01:05:38,429
I'm sure after all that,
we'll have no rapport.

808
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:41,190
But if you get mad enough,
I might find something.

809
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,925
Doctor Tredman, are you
hard of hearing?

810
01:05:44,136 --> 01:05:45,125
No.

811
01:05:45,337 --> 01:05:47,897
- I'm trying to tell you something.
- What?

812
01:05:48,974 --> 01:05:51,101
I don't need you anymore.

813
01:05:52,511 --> 01:05:54,911
I have no problems anymore.

814
01:05:57,749 --> 01:05:59,410
I'm in love.

815
01:05:59,885 --> 01:06:01,750
I am in love.

816
01:06:01,953 --> 01:06:05,116
I am really in love.

817
01:06:05,557 --> 01:06:07,787
I'm delighted to hear it.

818
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,224
Goodbye, Dr. Tredman.
Thank you for everything.

819
01:06:14,499 --> 01:06:18,993
While it is sometimes possible
that love can solve many things...

820
01:06:19,204 --> 01:06:23,402
...love is not so simple that you can
rely on it as a complete solution.

821
01:06:23,608 --> 01:06:24,802
So...

822
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:27,935
...if it isn't all that
you hoped it would be...

823
01:06:28,346 --> 01:06:31,474
...if it doesn't work out,
don't hesitate to come back...

824
01:06:31,683 --> 01:06:32,945
...quickly.

825
01:06:33,418 --> 01:06:35,010
But it will work out.

826
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,450
And I'm gonna make it work.

827
01:06:37,923 --> 01:06:39,049
But if it doesn't...

828
01:06:42,027 --> 01:06:43,619
But it will.

829
01:06:44,329 --> 01:06:45,921
It has to.

830
01:06:55,974 --> 01:06:58,306
Happy birthday, Steve!

831
01:06:58,643 --> 01:07:00,338
Come on in.
Norma's on the phone.

832
01:07:00,545 --> 01:07:02,012
Give her my best.

833
01:07:02,214 --> 01:07:03,613
Sorry, Norma.

834
01:07:04,015 --> 01:07:05,642
Yeah, that place sounds fine.

835
01:07:05,851 --> 01:07:07,819
I'll pick you up in a half-hour.

836
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,412
What?

837
01:07:09,821 --> 01:07:12,312
That was just a studio messenger.

838
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:14,487
See you later. Bye.

839
01:07:14,693 --> 01:07:16,320
What are you trying to do to me?

840
01:07:16,528 --> 01:07:19,326
Drive you wild with desire!

841
01:07:19,531 --> 01:07:21,465
Where have you been all this time?

842
01:07:21,666 --> 01:07:26,365
I've been chained to the wall in
a sanitarium to keep away from you.

843
01:07:26,771 --> 01:07:27,601
Indifference.

844
01:07:27,806 --> 01:07:30,707
You can't drive me away
this time with indifference.

845
01:07:30,909 --> 01:07:32,240
Norma's waiting. I gotta...

846
01:07:32,444 --> 01:07:36,471
Flesh and blood can only stand
so much voluptuous torture.

847
01:07:36,681 --> 01:07:38,911
You have 30 seconds, buddy-boy.

848
01:07:39,117 --> 01:07:40,846
Have you gone on the needle?

849
01:07:41,052 --> 01:07:42,485
I am hooked.

850
01:07:42,754 --> 01:07:43,982
I am hooked.

851
01:07:44,189 --> 01:07:45,713
- I'm hooked on you.
- Cut it out.

852
01:07:45,924 --> 01:07:47,653
You have 20 seconds.

853
01:07:47,859 --> 01:07:49,121
19...

854
01:07:49,327 --> 01:07:50,294
...18...

855
01:07:50,495 --> 01:07:52,122
...17...

856
01:07:54,566 --> 01:07:57,592
The coat!
Oh, Lord, the coat!

857
01:07:57,802 --> 01:08:00,362
She's coming back to town today!

858
01:08:00,572 --> 01:08:02,802
- What am I gonna do?
- 16...

859
01:08:03,008 --> 01:08:05,203
...15, 14...

860
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:08,174
- You're crazier than I am.
...13, 12...

861
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:10,075
- Bye. Happy birthday!
...11...

862
01:08:10,282 --> 01:08:13,809
...10, 9, 8, 7...

863
01:08:29,568 --> 01:08:30,592
Mrs. Liggett.

864
01:08:30,802 --> 01:08:33,327
Welcome home.
It's good to have you back.

865
01:08:33,538 --> 01:08:35,972
- How nice of you, George.
- How is Mrs. Jescott?

866
01:08:36,174 --> 01:08:38,699
She's coming along fine,
out of danger.

867
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:10,706
Darling, I didn't even
hear you come in.

868
01:09:10,909 --> 01:09:13,571
- You been standing there long?
- A minute.

869
01:09:15,547 --> 01:09:16,673
Welcome home.

870
01:09:16,881 --> 01:09:18,371
Thank you, Wes.

871
01:09:18,984 --> 01:09:20,349
Thank you.

872
01:09:22,153 --> 01:09:25,384
I must say, you're looking
surprisingly youthful.

873
01:09:25,724 --> 01:09:28,784
I'm far from being an old man,
as yet, I hope.

874
01:09:29,594 --> 01:09:32,927
I didn't mean that you ever were old.
It's just that...

875
01:09:33,264 --> 01:09:35,960
...there's a certain
aliveness about you.

876
01:09:36,568 --> 01:09:38,195
I don't know what I mean.

877
01:09:38,737 --> 01:09:40,500
Is your mother feeling better?

878
01:09:40,739 --> 01:09:42,730
Yes. Much.

879
01:09:43,108 --> 01:09:45,008
Well, that's nice. I'm glad.

880
01:09:46,511 --> 01:09:48,843
- Emily, there's something...
- I know. Missing.

881
01:09:49,047 --> 01:09:51,515
- What?
- I noticed it as soon as I came in.

882
01:09:51,716 --> 01:09:53,581
- What are you talking about?
- My coat.

883
01:09:53,785 --> 01:09:55,548
- What coat?
- My mink.

884
01:09:55,754 --> 01:09:58,985
- Your mink is missing?
- Didn't you know it was gone?

885
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:00,555
Of course not.

886
01:10:02,127 --> 01:10:03,355
See?

887
01:10:04,029 --> 01:10:06,520
- You must have misplaced it.
- I checked every closet.

888
01:10:06,731 --> 01:10:08,494
Maybe you left it out
at Long Island.

889
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,965
Just to make certain, I called Mother.
But it's not there.

890
01:10:12,404 --> 01:10:13,735
How could it be gone?

891
01:10:13,938 --> 01:10:15,030
I don't know.

892
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,935
I've been here every day...

893
01:10:17,142 --> 01:10:19,736
...and nobody else
has been in here but me.

894
01:10:19,944 --> 01:10:21,434
None of our friends...

895
01:10:22,213 --> 01:10:23,407
...nobody.

896
01:10:32,691 --> 01:10:33,919
Wes?

897
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,094
Have you thought of something?

898
01:10:37,295 --> 01:10:39,320
Yes, I was thinking...

899
01:10:40,031 --> 01:10:41,225
Yes?

900
01:10:47,605 --> 01:10:49,072
- You know, those...?
- What?

901
01:10:49,274 --> 01:10:52,937
Those magazine salesmen and people
who solicit for charities?

902
01:10:53,144 --> 01:10:55,908
I've heard some are
fronts for burglaries.

903
01:10:56,114 --> 01:10:58,981
You sound like a Park Avenue
Sherlock Holmes.

904
01:10:59,184 --> 01:11:02,278
Go ahead and laugh.
Stranger things have happened.

905
01:11:02,487 --> 01:11:04,955
The best thing to do
is call the police.

906
01:11:05,156 --> 01:11:06,350
No!

907
01:11:06,558 --> 01:11:07,718
Why not?

908
01:11:08,026 --> 01:11:11,928
- The cheap publicity and all.
- Expensive fur isn't cheap publicity.

909
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:13,757
And the insurance companies.

910
01:11:13,965 --> 01:11:18,493
If something's stolen, you're labeled
a bad risk and your premium goes up.

911
01:11:18,703 --> 01:11:20,864
You're ridiculous.
I don't understand it.

912
01:11:21,072 --> 01:11:22,562
Well, I do!

913
01:11:25,777 --> 01:11:27,836
I'll get a private detective.

914
01:11:28,847 --> 01:11:30,405
I know a good one.

915
01:11:30,849 --> 01:11:32,817
Private detective?

916
01:11:33,318 --> 01:11:36,185
This is real life,
not a television serial.

917
01:11:36,387 --> 01:11:39,652
- Mother lost a diamond...
- Let me do it without your mother.

918
01:11:42,827 --> 01:11:44,089
I didn't mean it that way.

919
01:11:44,295 --> 01:11:45,922
Which way did you mean it?

920
01:11:49,134 --> 01:11:50,726
I don't know.

921
01:11:51,536 --> 01:11:53,299
Wes, I'm your wife.

922
01:11:53,505 --> 01:11:56,668
- I wanna do things your way, even if...
- Think they're stupid?

923
01:12:00,478 --> 01:12:01,945
I'll see you later.

924
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,480
Tom...

925
01:12:11,389 --> 01:12:13,880
...you know Gloria,
dark-haired, this high...

926
01:12:14,092 --> 01:12:16,890
You don't have to describe
Gloria to me.

927
01:12:17,228 --> 01:12:20,095
I'd know her with my eyes
closed, in a coal mine...

928
01:12:20,298 --> 01:12:21,390
...during an eclipse.

929
01:12:21,599 --> 01:12:24,363
- Has she been here tonight?
- Not for over a week.

930
01:12:24,569 --> 01:12:25,866
Let me tell you something.

931
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:28,368
Without her, this place is dead.

932
01:12:28,573 --> 01:12:32,100
She's like catnip
to every cat in town.

933
01:12:51,129 --> 01:12:53,097
- Give me a scotch and water.
- Liggett!

934
01:12:53,298 --> 01:12:56,199
- Haven't seen you around.
- Make that a double.

935
01:12:56,501 --> 01:12:58,469
- How are you?
- Two brandies.

936
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:00,865
That's right.
I've been kind of busy.

937
01:13:01,172 --> 01:13:05,040
I heard. That's the business
I wouldn't mind having again.

938
01:13:05,944 --> 01:13:09,812
- What're you talking about?
- Come on, Liggett. Come on.

939
01:13:10,014 --> 01:13:11,606
Gloria!

940
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:12,874
Sure.

941
01:13:13,084 --> 01:13:17,111
She's frantic, isn't she?
Like a rocket right off the Earth.

942
01:13:17,322 --> 01:13:19,552
Who should know better
than yours truly?

943
01:13:20,291 --> 01:13:23,021
Mother, help me.
I'd have left home for that.

944
01:13:23,228 --> 01:13:25,719
She's got a traveling itch
like a flea.

945
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:30,867
Hop, hop, hop. One dog to another.
She picks you up, and she drops you.

946
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:35,098
Well, welcome to the fraternity.

947
01:13:35,506 --> 01:13:38,168
We meet once a year in Yankee Stadium.

948
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:44,241
Now, listen, Butterfield 8...

949
01:13:45,216 --> 01:13:47,343
...l've called her hundreds of times.

950
01:13:48,953 --> 01:13:50,682
I'm her closest friend.

951
01:13:51,522 --> 01:13:53,422
You've got to tell me where she is.

952
01:13:53,758 --> 01:13:55,692
It's a matter of life and death!

953
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,694
You're liars.

954
01:14:03,902 --> 01:14:06,268
Liars, all of you!
Thieves and liars!

955
01:14:06,471 --> 01:14:07,961
Now tell me!

956
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:34,429
- Do you know the speed limit here?
- No.

957
01:14:34,632 --> 01:14:36,998
40 miles an hour,
posted every half-mile.

958
01:14:37,201 --> 01:14:39,328
- Do you know how fast you were going?
- No.

959
01:14:39,537 --> 01:14:43,064
65 miles an hour.
Let me see your license, please.

960
01:14:50,448 --> 01:14:51,346
Thank you.

961
01:14:51,549 --> 01:14:53,608
Turn your face around toward me.

962
01:14:53,818 --> 01:14:55,183
Now breathe out.

963
01:14:56,621 --> 01:14:57,679
Thank you.

964
01:14:58,957 --> 01:15:00,515
You got troubled?

965
01:15:03,194 --> 01:15:05,287
- Yes.
- I thought so.

966
01:15:05,496 --> 01:15:06,929
Let me give you some advice.

967
01:15:07,131 --> 01:15:09,031
Don't try to drive your troubles away.

968
01:15:09,233 --> 01:15:11,497
First, you're gonna be
mad at the world.

969
01:15:11,703 --> 01:15:14,570
You push your foot down on that
gas pedal, and then you go.

970
01:15:14,872 --> 01:15:17,705
Tomorrow, the sun will come out
like it did this morning.

971
01:15:17,909 --> 01:15:19,274
Take it easy.

972
01:15:32,957 --> 01:15:33,855
Cookies.

973
01:15:37,395 --> 01:15:38,885
So what was I saying?

974
01:15:39,097 --> 01:15:42,965
So she said to herself,
"You get in solid with the director.

975
01:15:43,167 --> 01:15:45,465
He puts you in solid
with the producer.

976
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:47,831
You wind up with a big partnership."

977
01:15:48,039 --> 01:15:51,668
So two days, or should I say,
two nights later...

978
01:15:51,876 --> 01:15:53,707
...she was in, butt solid.

979
01:15:53,911 --> 01:15:56,573
Yeah, with the director,
with his cousin...

980
01:15:56,781 --> 01:16:01,343
She was so busy being in solid with
every Tom, Dick, Harry and George...

981
01:16:01,552 --> 01:16:05,079
...she wouldn't recognize a producer
if one was under her pillow.

982
01:16:05,289 --> 01:16:06,586
Do you take sugar?

983
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:10,158
So now time passes,
and our heroine is very big.

984
01:16:10,361 --> 01:16:12,795
Yeah, but not in the theater.

985
01:16:12,997 --> 01:16:14,794
No, in all the wrong places.

986
01:16:14,999 --> 01:16:17,297
In 500 little black books...

987
01:16:17,902 --> 01:16:19,267
...28 divorce cases...

988
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:25,005
...two police blotters and one
restraining sheet in Bellevue's ward.

989
01:16:25,209 --> 01:16:26,335
Are you sure?

990
01:16:28,179 --> 01:16:32,707
Yeah, she hit it big.
From a size 12 dress to a size 44.

991
01:16:33,418 --> 01:16:35,784
She went from looking
like an orchid...

992
01:16:35,987 --> 01:16:38,114
...to a face like a pan of worms.

993
01:16:38,322 --> 01:16:39,846
And all because...

994
01:16:40,058 --> 01:16:43,289
...she said, "With only a rag,
a bone, a hank of hair...

995
01:16:43,494 --> 01:16:45,587
...I will move the world my way!"

996
01:16:45,797 --> 01:16:47,765
What's the matter? I'm boring you?

997
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:54,604
You live it up.

998
01:16:54,806 --> 01:16:58,173
You kick up your heels.
You grab everything you can get.

999
01:16:58,376 --> 01:17:02,107
"You light the candle from one end
to the other," like they say.

1000
01:17:03,881 --> 01:17:07,009
And then one day, you too can be...

1001
01:17:07,218 --> 01:17:09,311
...the proud proprietor...

1002
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:13,422
...of a very heavily mortgaged,
roadside brothel...

1003
01:17:14,659 --> 01:17:16,559
...and wish you were dead.

1004
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:20,563
Good morning, darling.

1005
01:17:26,871 --> 01:17:29,431
- What time did you get in last night?
- Late.

1006
01:17:29,874 --> 01:17:32,069
Did the private detective have any...?

1007
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:33,640
Detective?

1008
01:17:33,845 --> 01:17:36,746
- The man you'll see about the coat.
- Oh, him.

1009
01:17:37,482 --> 01:17:38,471
He was on a job.

1010
01:17:38,683 --> 01:17:40,412
I'm gonna see him again today.

1011
01:17:53,131 --> 01:17:54,723
I've seen you drink...

1012
01:17:54,932 --> 01:17:57,492
...many times, but never
in the morning like this.

1013
01:17:58,102 --> 01:18:00,570
Don't worry, Emily.
It's not alcoholism.

1014
01:18:01,739 --> 01:18:03,730
It's just a kind of medicine.

1015
01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:07,734
Why don't you go back to bed?

1016
01:18:07,945 --> 01:18:09,276
I can't.

1017
01:18:10,281 --> 01:18:12,613
I have to go and look
for your fur coat.

1018
01:18:12,817 --> 01:18:14,648
Why do you feel so responsible?

1019
01:18:14,852 --> 01:18:17,787
- It disappeared while I was here.
- No one's blaming you.

1020
01:18:17,989 --> 01:18:19,354
- That's not the point.
- What is?

1021
01:18:25,196 --> 01:18:29,530
I could tell you things about
people, but never mind.

1022
01:18:30,368 --> 01:18:32,563
You have enough problems of your own.

1023
01:18:33,971 --> 01:18:36,166
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes.

1024
01:18:36,774 --> 01:18:41,404
When I come back with that coat, which
I will, I want you to throw me out.

1025
01:18:50,488 --> 01:18:52,718
- Hi, Mama.
- Hello, darling.

1026
01:18:55,526 --> 01:18:56,925
That looks pretty.

1027
01:18:57,128 --> 01:19:00,154
- You might like it for your bathroom.
- I would.

1028
01:19:01,265 --> 01:19:04,166
I'm sorry I didn't
come home last night.

1029
01:19:04,368 --> 01:19:05,858
That's all right.

1030
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:08,035
I spent the night in a motel.

1031
01:19:11,209 --> 01:19:12,676
Alone.

1032
01:19:13,144 --> 01:19:14,771
I had some thinking to do.

1033
01:19:21,819 --> 01:19:23,411
I saw a woman.

1034
01:19:24,021 --> 01:19:27,684
Utterly proper,
utterly conventional...

1035
01:19:28,226 --> 01:19:29,955
...utterly beautiful.

1036
01:19:34,065 --> 01:19:35,999
You're beautiful too, dear.

1037
01:19:38,069 --> 01:19:39,798
I have a face.

1038
01:19:40,538 --> 01:19:44,167
- That's not the kind of beauty I mean.
- What kind of beauty?

1039
01:19:47,211 --> 01:19:51,614
The kind that comes
from self-respect, I guess.

1040
01:19:51,816 --> 01:19:53,306
It shines.

1041
01:19:53,751 --> 01:19:55,514
I've seen that kind.

1042
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,950
It takes a lifetime to find.

1043
01:19:58,256 --> 01:20:00,156
I'm going to find it.

1044
01:20:00,725 --> 01:20:02,090
I think you will.

1045
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:04,186
Butterfield 8 called.

1046
01:20:05,363 --> 01:20:06,330
Any messages?

1047
01:20:06,597 --> 01:20:11,091
Mr. Liggett says he has to see you.
It's a matter of life and death.

1048
01:20:13,671 --> 01:20:15,468
Did he say when or where?

1049
01:20:15,740 --> 01:20:17,298
I've written it down.

1050
01:20:49,974 --> 01:20:51,236
So you did take it.

1051
01:20:54,512 --> 01:20:56,776
Yes. And I'm sorry, Liggett.

1052
01:20:57,281 --> 01:20:58,270
May I sit down?

1053
01:20:59,417 --> 01:21:00,679
That's up to you, honey.

1054
01:21:10,261 --> 01:21:14,254
- Would you care to order something?
- No, the lady's not going to order.

1055
01:21:18,636 --> 01:21:20,900
Why did you bother to bring it back?

1056
01:21:21,706 --> 01:21:23,571
Because it isn't mine.

1057
01:21:24,108 --> 01:21:26,133
Because you're scared, you mean.

1058
01:21:28,012 --> 01:21:31,448
Because you know I'm not an ordinary
Joe on your sleigh ride.

1059
01:21:31,649 --> 01:21:34,550
Because you know, while I might
have given you the world...

1060
01:21:35,286 --> 01:21:38,881
...l'd tear your head off if you
stole as much as a nickel from me.

1061
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:39,920
Isn't that it?

1062
01:21:41,992 --> 01:21:43,152
No.

1063
01:21:44,962 --> 01:21:48,056
So you pick up the man
when you want...

1064
01:21:48,966 --> 01:21:50,900
...and drop him like a bomb...

1065
01:21:52,403 --> 01:21:53,870
...when you want.

1066
01:21:56,273 --> 01:21:58,104
Get lost! We're talking!

1067
01:22:04,882 --> 01:22:07,350
People don't mean anything to you,
do they?

1068
01:22:08,486 --> 01:22:10,454
The way they feel in here.

1069
01:22:11,422 --> 01:22:13,219
Not down where you live.

1070
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:18,160
I care about some people.

1071
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,758
For an hour...

1072
01:22:19,964 --> 01:22:23,798
...or a day or a week.
Till you've had your kicks.

1073
01:22:24,502 --> 01:22:26,800
Then you slither off to the next one.

1074
01:22:28,873 --> 01:22:30,340
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1075
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:32,532
There isn't gonna be any tomorrow.

1076
01:22:33,177 --> 01:22:35,441
And for once,
somebody's going to drop you.

1077
01:22:35,646 --> 01:22:39,173
Go ahead, try that heel trick again.
The one that gets the boys hot.

1078
01:22:39,383 --> 01:22:41,146
And I'll rip this arm right out!

1079
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:44,947
- May I say something?
- Sure...

1080
01:22:45,156 --> 01:22:49,320
...honey, babe, dollface, kid.
Say something sexy!

1081
01:22:49,527 --> 01:22:52,462
Something that always got the boys
headed for the motel.

1082
01:22:53,898 --> 01:22:56,799
You can't have everything in life.

1083
01:22:57,535 --> 01:23:02,370
Be grateful for the few things you do
get, no matter where they come from.

1084
01:23:03,073 --> 01:23:04,199
The pornographic...

1085
01:23:04,408 --> 01:23:05,807
...philosopher!

1086
01:23:07,111 --> 01:23:10,103
Now, you just sit there
like a good tramp should...

1087
01:23:10,381 --> 01:23:12,440
...until I get out of your sight.

1088
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:15,483
I can't stomach being seen
in public with you.

1089
01:23:16,187 --> 01:23:17,017
Liggett.

1090
01:23:17,221 --> 01:23:19,621
And don't you dare
mention my name again!

1091
01:23:20,124 --> 01:23:23,582
You're a dirty joke, from one
end of this town to the other!

1092
01:23:23,794 --> 01:23:27,195
- That will be enough of that.
- Mind your own business!

1093
01:23:27,398 --> 01:23:29,491
- Now, look.
- Take it easy.

1094
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:32,669
There's other women in this place,
including my wife.

1095
01:23:37,441 --> 01:23:39,966
Hey! Take it easy, pal! Come on!

1096
01:23:42,112 --> 01:23:44,080
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1097
01:23:47,251 --> 01:23:49,742
I just must have
gone berserk, I guess.

1098
01:23:50,621 --> 01:23:53,146
He's gonna be all right.
I'm awfully sorry, miss.

1099
01:23:53,357 --> 01:23:55,291
Can I help you?

1100
01:24:36,333 --> 01:24:37,630
Mr. Liggett!

1101
01:24:38,035 --> 01:24:40,560
- Good heavens, what happened?
- Get away.

1102
01:24:40,771 --> 01:24:42,068
Liggett?

1103
01:24:43,507 --> 01:24:45,805
For a lousy fur coat, you'd do this?

1104
01:24:47,945 --> 01:24:51,278
You want me to give this back
to my wife after you touched it?

1105
01:25:56,213 --> 01:25:57,612
Leave me alone.

1106
01:26:01,652 --> 01:26:02,846
Do you want a doctor?

1107
01:26:03,954 --> 01:26:07,481
Yes, and tell him to make me
unconscious before I can think.

1108
01:26:31,248 --> 01:26:32,408
Who is it?

1109
01:26:33,651 --> 01:26:34,845
Who is it?

1110
01:26:36,053 --> 01:26:37,384
It's me.

1111
01:26:58,809 --> 01:27:00,367
Can I get you anything?

1112
01:27:21,231 --> 01:27:23,791
Ask me about the coat, Steve.

1113
01:27:24,234 --> 01:27:25,667
Ask me.

1114
01:27:28,839 --> 01:27:30,773
I see you still have it.

1115
01:27:35,779 --> 01:27:37,474
Because it's mine.

1116
01:27:41,351 --> 01:27:42,943
Every skin.

1117
01:27:44,254 --> 01:27:45,915
Every thread.

1118
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:48,387
Every hair...

1119
01:27:49,593 --> 01:27:50,855
...is mine.

1120
01:27:53,931 --> 01:27:55,592
And do you know why?

1121
01:27:57,835 --> 01:27:58,665
Why?

1122
01:28:01,271 --> 01:28:03,262
Because I earned it.

1123
01:28:04,308 --> 01:28:06,936
Pretty good pay for one week.

1124
01:28:08,378 --> 01:28:10,312
$ 1000 in fur a day.

1125
01:28:13,283 --> 01:28:15,251
You and Liggett couldn't make it?

1126
01:28:17,521 --> 01:28:20,115
That isn't the important thing now.

1127
01:28:22,593 --> 01:28:25,357
The important thing is, Steve...

1128
01:28:25,596 --> 01:28:26,927
...I took money.

1129
01:28:27,131 --> 01:28:29,656
- Do you know what that makes me?
- Baby, don't.

1130
01:28:37,307 --> 01:28:39,138
Let me cry.

1131
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:42,806
Let me cry!

1132
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:47,243
Like all the times I should have...

1133
01:28:47,985 --> 01:28:49,885
...and never could.

1134
01:29:14,444 --> 01:29:16,412
I have to tell you something.

1135
01:29:16,613 --> 01:29:19,878
- I know all about you, Gloria.
- You don't know this.

1136
01:29:20,884 --> 01:29:22,875
Nobody knows this...

1137
01:29:24,955 --> 01:29:29,016
...except a certain man somewhere...

1138
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:35,197
...who I'd like to think of as standing
in a lake filled with burning gasoline.

1139
01:29:39,102 --> 01:29:41,002
Please, listen.

1140
01:29:48,145 --> 01:29:49,772
I was 13.

1141
01:29:51,181 --> 01:29:53,046
My father was dead.

1142
01:29:54,885 --> 01:29:58,321
All older men seemed
like fathers to me.

1143
01:30:00,157 --> 01:30:02,387
But I wanted one of my own...

1144
01:30:04,261 --> 01:30:06,320
...to sit in his lap...

1145
01:30:07,364 --> 01:30:08,797
...to hug him...

1146
01:30:10,868 --> 01:30:13,462
...and have him say I was beautiful.

1147
01:30:17,474 --> 01:30:19,669
Do you remember Major Hartley?

1148
01:30:20,077 --> 01:30:21,203
I remember him.

1149
01:30:25,182 --> 01:30:27,082
Major Hartley.

1150
01:30:28,018 --> 01:30:29,952
My mother's friend.

1151
01:30:32,990 --> 01:30:37,927
He came down to Grand Central Station
one day to pick me up from camp.

1152
01:30:39,363 --> 01:30:41,194
Mother was away visiting.

1153
01:30:42,366 --> 01:30:44,027
He took me home.

1154
01:30:45,869 --> 01:30:48,133
He let me sit on his lap.

1155
01:30:49,306 --> 01:30:51,069
He let me hug him.

1156
01:30:53,043 --> 01:30:55,511
He told me I was beautiful.

1157
01:30:57,314 --> 01:31:00,078
He stayed in that house
for one week...

1158
01:31:00,417 --> 01:31:05,354
...and taught me more about evil than
any 13-year-old girl in the world knew.

1159
01:31:05,555 --> 01:31:06,749
Don't.

1160
01:31:07,391 --> 01:31:10,326
You haven't heard the worst of it yet!

1161
01:31:10,527 --> 01:31:12,620
I loved it!

1162
01:31:13,063 --> 01:31:17,397
Every awful moment of it, I loved!

1163
01:31:18,268 --> 01:31:21,101
That's your Gloria, Steve!

1164
01:31:21,305 --> 01:31:24,570
That's your darling Gloria!

1165
01:31:30,714 --> 01:31:33,410
I made a way of life out of it.

1166
01:31:34,518 --> 01:31:38,181
The deep shame of it didn't
hit me until it was too late.

1167
01:31:40,891 --> 01:31:43,621
I couldn't go back to 13 again.

1168
01:31:46,163 --> 01:31:48,791
I had one chance to stop it.

1169
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:52,027
One last chance.

1170
01:31:54,571 --> 01:31:56,004
And I...

1171
01:31:56,473 --> 01:31:58,532
...I threw it...

1172
01:31:58,742 --> 01:32:01,404
...all away for 32 animals...

1173
01:32:01,611 --> 01:32:04,910
...sewn together in a coat.

1174
01:32:08,952 --> 01:32:11,648
It's not all over.
Give it another chance.

1175
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:14,557
Where you going?

1176
01:32:14,758 --> 01:32:16,589
- It doesn't matter.
- Wait!

1177
01:32:16,994 --> 01:32:19,554
It matters a great deal,
what you do.

1178
01:32:21,832 --> 01:32:24,767
You've got to decide
what you're gonna do next.

1179
01:32:25,068 --> 01:32:26,433
I do too.

1180
01:32:26,737 --> 01:32:28,466
Stay here tonight.

1181
01:32:46,156 --> 01:32:47,919
Thank you, Steve.

1182
01:33:12,049 --> 01:33:13,778
Anything you need?

1183
01:33:15,819 --> 01:33:17,753
There is. A divorce.

1184
01:33:19,923 --> 01:33:22,414
There's no call for such remorse
over last night.

1185
01:33:22,626 --> 01:33:24,150
Let's face it, Emily.

1186
01:33:24,494 --> 01:33:26,894
I'm a failure as a husband
and as a man.

1187
01:33:28,065 --> 01:33:29,327
Wes, I love you!

1188
01:33:30,767 --> 01:33:31,597
I know you do.

1189
01:33:34,604 --> 01:33:37,266
That makes the divorce
all the more necessary...

1190
01:33:37,474 --> 01:33:40,068
...because I can't go on
disappointing you.

1191
01:33:40,410 --> 01:33:43,243
- Couldn't you try?
- No.

1192
01:33:48,552 --> 01:33:50,042
Do you love her?

1193
01:33:50,587 --> 01:33:53,147
- That woman you were with.
- I seem to.

1194
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:56,652
But you fought over her
and sent her away in a rage.

1195
01:33:57,727 --> 01:33:59,194
Yes, I did.

1196
01:34:00,397 --> 01:34:03,491
I was sick because I was afraid
I was going to lose her.

1197
01:34:03,867 --> 01:34:07,166
I hated her unreasonably because
I couldn't stand losing her.

1198
01:34:08,605 --> 01:34:10,766
Just as you hate me now.

1199
01:34:59,556 --> 01:35:00,682
Good morning.

1200
01:35:00,891 --> 01:35:02,586
Good morning, sweetheart.

1201
01:35:03,059 --> 01:35:06,722
Open your eyes good and make sure
you know who you're talking to.

1202
01:35:07,564 --> 01:35:10,397
- Norma, isn't it?
- Shrewd guess.

1203
01:35:20,377 --> 01:35:21,674
I wanna marry you today.

1204
01:35:28,485 --> 01:35:30,885
I haven't anything else to do.

1205
01:35:31,555 --> 01:35:33,853
Good. I'll be ready in a minute.

1206
01:35:38,728 --> 01:35:40,855
Fine. Thank you very much.

1207
01:35:41,064 --> 01:35:42,759
Okay. Bye.

1208
01:35:44,734 --> 01:35:47,794
I've just called Butterfield 8
to shut off the service...

1209
01:35:48,004 --> 01:35:49,631
...and to send me a bill.

1210
01:35:51,641 --> 01:35:55,168
As soon as I have an address in
Boston, will you forward it to me?

1211
01:35:55,378 --> 01:35:57,039
Yes, dear, I will.

1212
01:36:01,885 --> 01:36:03,477
Take care of Mama.

1213
01:36:03,687 --> 01:36:06,053
I've got plans for her.
My cousin Harry.

1214
01:36:06,256 --> 01:36:09,123
- Oh, Frances!
- I'm a born matchmaker.

1215
01:36:09,326 --> 01:36:10,418
10%, of course.

1216
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:12,321
Naturally!

1217
01:36:12,596 --> 01:36:16,225
I don't want to be a nosy
neighbor, but why Boston?

1218
01:36:16,833 --> 01:36:19,358
That's where the Pilgrims
made a fresh start.

1219
01:36:19,569 --> 01:36:22,129
If it's good enough for them,
I can take it.

1220
01:36:22,405 --> 01:36:23,872
Can Boston take you?

1221
01:36:24,074 --> 01:36:26,042
What will you do in Boston, dear?

1222
01:36:26,576 --> 01:36:30,979
Well, I'll buy a paper.
Look up the want ads.

1223
01:36:31,181 --> 01:36:33,547
Same as any girl without a job.

1224
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:37,686
Before we all start crying,
let's get the luggage in the car.

1225
01:36:38,221 --> 01:36:40,485
This is as close
as I'll ever get to heaven.

1226
01:36:40,690 --> 01:36:41,987
Do you like it?

1227
01:36:42,392 --> 01:36:45,691
Of course not. I'm only faint
from not eating in three days.

1228
01:36:45,895 --> 01:36:47,055
It's yours.

1229
01:36:47,264 --> 01:36:48,094
No.

1230
01:36:48,965 --> 01:36:50,193
Wear it in good health.

1231
01:36:50,533 --> 01:36:53,195
Oh, no.
You can't bribe me with this.

1232
01:36:53,403 --> 01:36:57,339
I could never say a mean word about
you ever again. I'd die of boredom.

1233
01:36:57,941 --> 01:37:00,409
Well, then just keep it warm for me.

1234
01:37:05,015 --> 01:37:06,607
Goodbye, Mama.

1235
01:37:10,253 --> 01:37:12,448
I don't want you to go.

1236
01:37:16,059 --> 01:37:18,789
I have a feeling
you'll never come back.

1237
01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:22,396
I never will come back, Mama.

1238
01:37:23,767 --> 01:37:26,861
But I'll send for you
as soon as I can.

1239
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:42,914
Did she leave any forwarding
address or number?

1240
01:37:45,922 --> 01:37:47,116
Now, look...

1241
01:37:47,957 --> 01:37:51,222
...this is the most important
telephone call of my life.

1242
01:37:51,728 --> 01:37:53,855
You must tell me, please.

1243
01:37:56,733 --> 01:37:57,961
Boston?

1244
01:37:58,968 --> 01:38:00,265
You're certain?

1245
01:38:02,972 --> 01:38:04,633
Thank you, Butterfield 8.

1246
01:38:05,408 --> 01:38:06,602
Thanks.

1247
01:38:53,823 --> 01:38:56,485
Don't be frightened, Gloria. Please.

1248
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:09,265
I can only think of one apology.

1249
01:39:09,906 --> 01:39:11,430
Will you marry me?

1250
01:39:12,242 --> 01:39:14,210
I've arranged for a divorce.

1251
01:39:14,477 --> 01:39:15,739
Wait for me and...

1252
01:39:15,945 --> 01:39:19,142
...l'll make you forget every word
I uttered last night.

1253
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:21,547
You can't.

1254
01:39:22,652 --> 01:39:24,847
I'm left with those words.

1255
01:39:25,488 --> 01:39:27,479
I'm branded with them.

1256
01:39:29,859 --> 01:39:31,850
Thank you for asking me to marry you.

1257
01:39:36,566 --> 01:39:40,263
If only you'd done it yesterday,
it might have meant something.

1258
01:39:41,204 --> 01:39:42,364
But not today.

1259
01:39:42,605 --> 01:39:44,664
But I only did
what I did last night...

1260
01:39:44,874 --> 01:39:47,638
...because you were so much
in my blood that I exploded.

1261
01:39:49,479 --> 01:39:51,572
But you were right last night.

1262
01:39:52,782 --> 01:39:55,250
No man could marry me...

1263
01:39:55,452 --> 01:39:57,443
...and not keep remembering.

1264
01:40:00,623 --> 01:40:04,457
You'd have to explode
at my life, past and...

1265
01:40:06,029 --> 01:40:08,224
You couldn't help but explode.

1266
01:40:12,135 --> 01:40:14,763
I can think of a dozen apologies.

1267
01:40:14,971 --> 01:40:16,734
Oh, I know.

1268
01:40:17,207 --> 01:40:18,970
And I'd accept.

1269
01:40:19,576 --> 01:40:21,305
But then look.

1270
01:40:21,911 --> 01:40:25,005
Look at all the thousands
of explosions ahead...

1271
01:40:25,215 --> 01:40:28,184
...and the thousands
of apologies and acceptances...

1272
01:40:28,384 --> 01:40:32,377
...until we both got so disgusted.
- I love you. I love you.

1273
01:40:35,792 --> 01:40:37,657
And I love you.

1274
01:40:40,497 --> 01:40:43,466
It's no use. It's no damn use.

1275
01:40:45,502 --> 01:40:47,060
Let's go someplace to talk.

1276
01:40:48,538 --> 01:40:49,732
Over at Happy's.

1277
01:40:49,939 --> 01:40:51,372
Just talk.

1278
01:40:51,841 --> 01:40:54,674
Just so that we can be
together and alone.

1279
01:40:55,445 --> 01:40:57,879
So that I can tell you
what I want to do.

1280
01:40:59,215 --> 01:41:01,581
If I get in a room with you...

1281
01:41:02,585 --> 01:41:04,883
...together, alone...

1282
01:41:05,088 --> 01:41:06,715
...I know what will happen.

1283
01:41:06,923 --> 01:41:09,221
It'll be the same thing
all over again.

1284
01:41:09,959 --> 01:41:12,450
We started this whole thing together.

1285
01:41:14,163 --> 01:41:17,098
We're obligated to solve it together.

1286
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:19,065
Please.

1287
01:41:42,559 --> 01:41:44,186
Hello, Mr. Liggett.

1288
01:41:44,594 --> 01:41:47,119
You brought another weary traveler.

1289
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:48,888
Hi, honey.

1290
01:41:49,499 --> 01:41:50,488
Welcome home.

1291
01:41:51,067 --> 01:41:53,968
- Give me a key, Happy.
- IH eys, that's my business.

1292
01:41:54,671 --> 01:41:57,572
- Here pass the most beautiful...
- Give me a key.

1293
01:41:57,807 --> 01:41:59,832
Yeah, yeah. Right away.

1294
01:45:49,539 --> 01:45:51,268
You saw the accident?

1295
01:45:52,441 --> 01:45:53,499
Yes.

1296
01:45:53,876 --> 01:45:55,173
Your name, please.

1297
01:45:55,378 --> 01:45:56,868
Weston Liggett.

1298
01:45:57,313 --> 01:46:00,305
1038 Fifth Avenue, New York City.

1299
01:46:00,616 --> 01:46:04,712
I stopped that same girl for speeding.
I wish I'd put her in jail then.

1300
01:46:04,921 --> 01:46:07,583
- They didn't make her name yet?
- No.

1301
01:46:07,790 --> 01:46:10,486
- Gloria Wandrous.
- You knew her?

1302
01:46:12,495 --> 01:46:14,588
We were traveling north...

1303
01:46:15,364 --> 01:46:16,558
...together.

1304
01:46:37,019 --> 01:46:40,147
You're going to read about it
in the newspapers tomorrow.

1305
01:46:41,924 --> 01:46:43,323
The family name...

1306
01:46:43,726 --> 01:46:45,887
...your picture, my picture...

1307
01:46:46,329 --> 01:46:47,626
...everything.

1308
01:46:50,266 --> 01:46:51,460
I'm...

1309
01:46:52,068 --> 01:46:53,399
...sorry.

1310
01:46:54,937 --> 01:46:56,996
I don't understand.

1311
01:46:57,206 --> 01:46:59,834
- What's happened? Tell me.
- She's dead.

1312
01:47:01,444 --> 01:47:03,571
She lived for an hour unconscious.

1313
01:47:04,046 --> 01:47:06,139
- But she's dead.
- Who?

1314
01:47:07,984 --> 01:47:09,474
- That girl?
- Yes.

1315
01:47:10,653 --> 01:47:13,053
- Terrible.
- Automobile accident.

1316
01:47:15,157 --> 01:47:16,419
She was...

1317
01:47:16,659 --> 01:47:18,820
...trying to get away from me.

1318
01:47:19,896 --> 01:47:23,491
I'm sorry. So sorry.

1319
01:47:25,334 --> 01:47:29,634
I don't suppose that anybody would
think that she was a good person.

1320
01:47:31,574 --> 01:47:33,735
But, strangely enough, she was.

1321
01:47:35,144 --> 01:47:38,944
On the surface, she was all
sex and devil-may-care.

1322
01:47:40,182 --> 01:47:44,346
Yet everything in her was
struggling toward respectability.

1323
01:47:46,055 --> 01:47:47,989
She never gave up trying.

1324
01:48:01,437 --> 01:48:04,235
I'm going out looking for my pride.

1325
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:05,634
Alone.

1326
01:48:06,909 --> 01:48:10,811
When I find it, if you're here,
I'll come back.

1327
01:48:12,114 --> 01:48:13,741
And we'll see if it...

1328
01:48:14,350 --> 01:48:16,215
...still has any value...

1329
01:48:16,452 --> 01:48:17,612
...to either of us.
