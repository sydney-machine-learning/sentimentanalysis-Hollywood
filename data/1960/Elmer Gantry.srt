1
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:39,208
(laughter)

2
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:46,457
So, anyway... anyway,
this guy comes home, you see,

3
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:48,966
and he finds his wife with his best friend.

4
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:52,181
And the husband says
"Harry, how could you do this?"

5
00:02:52,308 --> 00:02:57,469
And the wife, she says "Why should you
complain? Harry didn't do it to you!"

6
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,815
- What did I tell you? Isn't he a card?
- Class. Real class.

7
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:07,437
With his gift of the gab
he could go places.

8
00:03:07,574 --> 00:03:10,409
Hey, pal, you oughta quit
that punk job of yours.

9
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:14,034
- Why don't you join a sales outfit?
- It's no use, boys.

10
00:03:14,164 --> 00:03:18,375
Every time I'm in town, I ask him to go
on the road for our company. Right, pal?

11
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:21,538
Sure, Ed, sure. Listen, fellas, listen.

12
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:26,416
Two dames at a bar. One dame says to
another "If I don't get to bed pretty soon,

13
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:29,421
I'm goin' home and go to sleep!"

14
00:03:31,764 --> 00:03:34,552
Would you make it a merry Christmas
for some poor orphan?

15
00:03:34,684 --> 00:03:35,882
Here you are, lady.

16
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:38,391
That oughtn't to be allowed
in a place like this.

17
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:42,021
- Religion don't belong in a speakeasy.
- I know it's Christmas, but...

18
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,685
Mac, wait a minute. Excuse me,
Sister. Excuse me. Excuse me.

19
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,358
Don't tell me we're gonna let
these angels of mercy

20
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,241
go away from here
empty-handed on Christmas Eve.

21
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:54,203
This joint is the home
of fine bourbon and fast women,

22
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:57,745
and we need plenty of religion
to keep 'em both in line. So, come on.

23
00:03:57,874 --> 00:04:02,999
Get it up, now. Come on. Oh, come on.
A little action here. What's the matter?

24
00:04:05,507 --> 00:04:06,917
Oh.

25
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:11,086
Hey!

26
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:14,590
Hey, Lord? Can you hear me
up there, Jesus?

27
00:04:14,724 --> 00:04:17,511
You didn't think we'd forget
your birthday, did you?

28
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:22,306
There you are, Jesus. And if I had
any more, you'd be welcome to it.

29
00:04:23,316 --> 00:04:26,021
- Thank you, brother.
- (laughter)

30
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:31,147
The Bible says "Never let your left hand
know what your right hand is doing."

31
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:35,362
What's your beef, mister?
You ashamed of bein' a Christian?

32
00:04:35,495 --> 00:04:40,323
I see. You think religion is for suckers
and easy marks and mollycoddles, huh?

33
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,495
You think Jesus was some kind
of a sissy, eh? Let me tell you,

34
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:47,578
Jesus wouldn't be afraid to walk in here
or any speakeasy to preach the gospel.

35
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:52,128
Jesus had guts! He wasn't afraid
of the whole Roman army.

36
00:04:52,262 --> 00:04:55,547
Think that quarterback's
hot stuff? Well, let me tell you,

37
00:04:55,682 --> 00:05:00,178
Jesus would have made the best little
all-American quarterback in history.

38
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:05,816
Jesus was a real fighter. The best little
scrapper, pound for pound, you ever saw.

39
00:05:05,942 --> 00:05:09,192
And why, gentlemen? Love, gentlemen.

40
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,270
Jesus had love in both fists.
And what is love?

41
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:19,947
Love is the mornin' and the evenin' star
that shines on the cradle of the babe.

42
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:22,406
Hey, sinners!

43
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:26,456
Love is the inspiration
of poets and philosophers.

44
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:31,206
Love is the voice of music.

45
00:05:31,342 --> 00:05:35,885
I'm talkin' about divine love,
not carnal love.

46
00:05:36,014 --> 00:05:39,548
- That was a beautiful sermon, Parson.
- (laughter)

47
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:41,558
- Beautiful.
- Thank you, sister.

48
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:44,806
- I gotta get home to the little woman.
- Here you are, Sister.

49
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:48,273
Merry Christmas. Thank the Lord,
Sister. Thank the Lord.

50
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:50,726
- Gotta go. Gotta catch a rattler.
- Me too.

51
00:05:50,862 --> 00:05:54,729
Time to take up a little female
companionship. Wait a minute.

52
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:57,274
That's a swell preacher act you got, pal.

53
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,487
I gotta catch a rattler myself. Ed,
we still got the whole night ahead of us.

54
00:06:02,624 --> 00:06:06,456
Whatever you do, never lose
that little black address book.

55
00:06:06,586 --> 00:06:08,625
Merry Christmas!

56
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,250
Mr Gantry?

57
00:06:15,595 --> 00:06:18,596
And a merry Christmas to you too, sir.

58
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:21,759
You'll have to chalk it up.
The rest of these drinks, too.

59
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:23,553
Charity.

60
00:06:23,686 --> 00:06:26,474
I oughta get myself a tambourine.

61
00:06:27,482 --> 00:06:30,851
That's the trouble with this stinking world.

62
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:33,227
Nobody loves nobody.

63
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:37,865
Mac... the lady's glass is empty.

64
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:48,749
(Phone rings)

65
00:06:52,632 --> 00:06:54,672
(knocking at door)

66
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:00,596
(groans)

67
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:06,644
OK.

68
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:13,610
- Long-distance phone call.
- What time is it?

69
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:16,274
The phone call you made
to Mrs Gantry last night?

70
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:18,197
Oh. Yeah, thanks.

71
00:07:18,324 --> 00:07:21,693
- Merry Christmas, Mr Gantry.
- You too.

72
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:24,698
And a happy New Year, Mr Gantry.

73
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,660
Well, I'll take...
I'll take care of you downstairs.

74
00:07:32,797 --> 00:07:35,466
Get my bags out now.

75
00:07:42,307 --> 00:07:44,346
Hello? Hello?

76
00:07:57,322 --> 00:07:59,729
(woman) Ready with your call, Mr Gantry

77
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:03,401
Hello? Oh, hello, Mom. Merry Christmas.

78
00:08:03,536 --> 00:08:06,110
Me, Elm!

79
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:08,454
Just a sec, Mom.

80
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,620
I just got back from church myself.

81
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:17,915
I prayed for you too.

82
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:20,293
How'd you like my present?

83
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:22,468
You sure? Gee, that's funny.

84
00:08:22,597 --> 00:08:25,266
Well, maybe it got held up
in the holiday rush.

85
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:30,552
I just called up to wish you merry
Christmas, that's all, to tell you I love you.

86
00:08:32,482 --> 00:08:34,688
Don't start crying.

87
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:36,561
Ma...

88
00:08:36,694 --> 00:08:41,985
I know I promised, but I couldn't get away.
I've been busy. Yeah, business.

89
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:47,193
Guaranteed and delivered. I'll be home
next Easter. My absolute promise.

90
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,370
Ma, don't cry.

91
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:59,122
Ma, I gotta go. I really gotta go, Ma.
I gotta catch a train.

92
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:02,544
Sure. Sure. I'll talk to you. Take care.

93
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,303
Bye.

94
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:01,191
(train whistle)

95
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:13,954
(train whistle)

96
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:21,562
(choir singing "I'm On My Way")

97
00:11:25,446 --> 00:11:28,364
? I'm on my way

98
00:11:28,491 --> 00:11:31,777
? Off to Canaan land

99
00:11:32,412 --> 00:11:35,163
? I'm on my way

100
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,122
? Off to Canaan land

101
00:11:39,252 --> 00:11:40,711
? I'm on my way

102
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:42,414
? Glory, hallelujah

103
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:45,501
? I'm on my way

104
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:49,049
? Well, I'm on my way

105
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:53,011
? Off to Canaan land

106
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:55,976
? I'm on my way

107
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:59,886
? Off to Canaan land

108
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:02,940
? I'm on my way

109
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:06,851
? Off to Canaan land

110
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:08,399
? I'm on my way

111
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:10,156
? Glory, hallelujah

112
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:13,118
? I'm on my way

113
00:12:13,244 --> 00:12:16,779
? Had a mighty hard time

114
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:20,034
? But I'm on my way

115
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,710
? Had a mighty hard time

116
00:12:23,838 --> 00:12:26,839
? But I'm on my way

117
00:12:27,342 --> 00:12:30,461
? It's a mighty hard climb

118
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:34,635
? But I'm on my way

119
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:36,225
? On my way

120
00:12:36,351 --> 00:12:37,893
? Glory, hallelujah

121
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:41,055
? I'm on my way

122
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:44,225
? All along the way

123
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:47,728
? Satan lies a-waitin'

124
00:12:47,862 --> 00:12:50,982
? Every night and day

125
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:54,484
? Satan lies a-waitin'

126
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:57,822
? Hear me shout and say

127
00:12:57,956 --> 00:13:01,656
? Get behind me, Satan

128
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:03,335
? I'm on my way

129
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:05,003
? Glory, hallelujah

130
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:07,965
? I'm on my way

131
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:11,424
? Fight the devil and pray

132
00:13:11,553 --> 00:13:14,886
? Take another step higher

133
00:13:15,014 --> 00:13:18,218
? Fight the devil and pray

134
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:21,802
? Lord, I want to climb higher

135
00:13:21,938 --> 00:13:25,105
? Chase the devil away

136
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:28,602
? Lord, I'm caught in his fire

137
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:30,610
? I'm on my way

138
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:32,363
? Glory, hallelujah

139
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,325
? I'm on my way

140
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:38,322
? Lord, I'm on my way

141
00:13:38,955 --> 00:13:41,826
? Lord, I'm on my way

142
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:46,916
? Lord, Lord

143
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:48,956
? Lord, I'm on my way

144
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:54,760
? I'm on my way

145
00:14:06,858 --> 00:14:11,520
- You'd better get at this while it's still hot.
- Thank you, brother.

146
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:20,072
Would you look at this filthy magazine,
Reverend? Shameful. Shameful.

147
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:24,867
Burn, ye naked Jezebel, burn.
Like a blindin' flash.

148
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:27,836
"Suddenly there shined round
about him a light from heaven,

149
00:14:27,962 --> 00:14:30,288
- and he heard a voice say unto him..."
- "Saul. Saul."

150
00:14:30,423 --> 00:14:32,748
- "Why persecutest thou me?"
- Saul of Tarsus.

151
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:35,209
Acts, chapter nine.

152
00:14:35,345 --> 00:14:37,670
"And straightaway he preached.
Christ is the son of God."

153
00:14:37,806 --> 00:14:40,972
- "And all who heard him were amazed."
- "Amazed."

154
00:14:41,684 --> 00:14:44,520
Excuse me, but you sound
like a preacher.

155
00:14:45,355 --> 00:14:49,732
- Great black-eyed peas, Reverend. Great.
- If you'll be needing a place to sleep...

156
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:53,774
Thank you kindly, but as soon as
I haul these ashes, I'll be on my way.

157
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:59,065
- Well, God be with you, brother.
- Put in a good word for me, brother.

158
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,997
- Back again, Mr Gantry?
- Yes, indeed.

159
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:10,998
Come spring, come the drllmmer man.

160
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,089
Good morning, good morning,
good morning - and a hot morning it is.

161
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:19,552
Sam, as the blind man said
to the elephant, long time no see.

162
00:15:19,681 --> 00:15:21,389
Last March.

163
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:24,849
I got a great new item for you -
an electric toaster that pops.

164
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:27,136
- No.
- An egg beater that's a lulu.

165
00:15:27,272 --> 00:15:29,311
No sale.

166
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:33,684
This little devil's
gonna clean up America.

167
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,525
You sold me nine of them
vacuum cleaners last year.

168
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:39,491
There they are, all nine of 'em.

169
00:15:39,617 --> 00:15:43,318
Well, no harm done. How about
a free snort on the house?

170
00:15:43,454 --> 00:15:47,583
(laughs) That's how you
stuck me the last time.

171
00:15:49,627 --> 00:15:53,839
Ever hear the one about the missionary,
the cannibal and the chorus girl?

172
00:15:53,965 --> 00:15:57,416
This Sister Sharon -
she any good at preachin'?

173
00:15:57,552 --> 00:16:00,802
I don't know. I don't go
to prayer meetings. I mean...

174
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,391
unless business is bad
or I get sick. Times like that.

175
00:16:05,518 --> 00:16:11,058
Say, how about the missionary and
the cannibals and the chorus girl, hm?

176
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:17,066
There she was in the wildest jungles
of Borneo, without a stitch on,

177
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:20,281
except her dancin' shoes
and her pith helmet.

178
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:29,373
Can I speak to Mrs Wilson,
please? Thank you.

179
00:16:32,378 --> 00:16:37,040
Hello? Hello, Sally?
Me. Elmer. Who do you think?

180
00:16:37,926 --> 00:16:41,875
Swell, just swell. How's every
little thing with you, honey?

181
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:44,682
- Baby, I just got into town.
- (knocking at door)

182
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:47,477
Hold it a sec, Sal. Come in.

183
00:16:48,645 --> 00:16:52,061
- How did we do?
- Ran out of the money in both races.

184
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:57,313
Sally? How about tonight, baby?

185
00:16:58,655 --> 00:17:01,324
What time does your husband get home?

186
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:05,077
But, honey, I won't be here tomorrow.

187
00:17:05,203 --> 00:17:09,331
Well, look, can you come over
for an hour? A half an hour, huh?

188
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:11,997
Oh.

189
00:17:12,126 --> 00:17:14,415
Sure, Sal. Sure I understand.

190
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:19,540
Think nothin' of it, honey. I'll catch
you next time around. Bye, now.

191
00:17:19,884 --> 00:17:21,378
- Did you get the bottle?
- Nah.

192
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:24,761
You know bootleggers.
They do a cash business.

193
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:29,970
- Toss you. Double or nothin'.
- No. You're too lucky, Mr Gantry.

194
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:33,472
- Thank you. Anything else I can do?
- Thanks, kid.

195
00:17:38,653 --> 00:17:45,154
(woman) ? Just now,
your doubting give o'er

196
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:51,537
? Just now, reject Him no more

197
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:59,753
? Just now, throw open the door

198
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:07,837
? Let Jesus come into your heart

199
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:12,683
? Lay we every burden down

200
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:16,976
? Grace our spirits will deliver

201
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:21,936
? And provide a robe and crown

202
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:27,074
? Yes, we'll gather at the river

203
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:32,155
? The beautiful, the beautiful river

204
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:36,911
? Gather with the saints at the river

205
00:18:37,045 --> 00:18:42,205
? That flows by the throne of God

206
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:47,212
? Yes, we'll gather at the river

207
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:52,341
? The beautiful, the beautiful river

208
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:56,806
? Gather with the saints at the river

209
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:03,144
? That flows by the throne of God

210
00:19:08,868 --> 00:19:11,573
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

211
00:19:11,704 --> 00:19:14,077
Welcome to the house of God.

212
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:16,246
(fanfare)

213
00:19:17,627 --> 00:19:22,622
? Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord

214
00:19:22,757 --> 00:19:27,419
? He is trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are stored

215
00:19:27,554 --> 00:19:31,847
? He hath loosed the fateful lightning
of His terrible swift sword

216
00:19:32,225 --> 00:19:37,432
? His truth is marching on

217
00:19:37,564 --> 00:19:41,478
? Glory, glory, hallelujah!

218
00:19:42,318 --> 00:19:46,612
? Glory, glory, hallelujah!

219
00:19:47,031 --> 00:19:51,076
? Glory, glory, hallelujah!

220
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:56,410
? His truth is marching on

221
00:19:56,541 --> 00:20:01,167
? Glory, glory, hallelujah!

222
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:05,253
? Glory, glory, hallelujah!

223
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:10,000
? Glory, glory, hallelujah!

224
00:20:10,138 --> 00:20:17,184
? His truth is marching on

225
00:20:29,532 --> 00:20:32,486
Oh, my dear, beautiful people.

226
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:36,568
When I arrived here and I saw
your gracious countryside,

227
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:40,620
I said to myself "I won't.
I just won't be cooped up

228
00:20:40,752 --> 00:20:45,295
with a lot of stodgy old ministers
discussing hell and damnation!"

229
00:20:50,011 --> 00:20:52,300
So I sneaked out,

230
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:57,721
and I've been doing what most
of you have been doing - farming.

231
00:20:57,852 --> 00:21:00,522
Milking the cows, lying in the clover,

232
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:05,889
and letting the joy of God's nature
flow into my heart.

233
00:21:08,988 --> 00:21:12,322
And here's the proof
there's a happy, joyful God,

234
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,570
a bountiful God, a generous God.

235
00:21:17,372 --> 00:21:18,996
Milk!

236
00:21:22,836 --> 00:21:24,875
Here, Reverend. The Lord's nectar.

237
00:21:25,004 --> 00:21:28,089
And pass it along to those
dear newspaper reporters

238
00:21:28,216 --> 00:21:31,466
so they can wash out the taste of whisky.

239
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:37,047
Tonight...

240
00:21:37,183 --> 00:21:42,141
tonight I feel gloriously happy,
and I want you to feel happy too.

241
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,688
We're gonna sing together,
laugh together, rejoice together

242
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:48,224
like carefree children of a happy God.

243
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:52,739
We're going to rejoice that inside
of us lives the veritable spirit

244
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:55,866
of the everlasting
redeeming Christ, Jesus.

245
00:21:55,994 --> 00:21:58,567
- Hallelujah!
- Praise the Lord!

246
00:22:03,793 --> 00:22:08,005
Bill, see how many of those dear people
can match God's bountiful gift

247
00:22:08,131 --> 00:22:09,708
with their own offerings.

248
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:14,467
You darlings can't make milk,
and God just won't make money.

249
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:19,385
? Stand up, stand up for Jesus

250
00:22:19,684 --> 00:22:23,931
? Ye soldiers of the cross

251
00:22:24,063 --> 00:22:28,013
? Lift high His royal banner

252
00:22:28,151 --> 00:22:30,523
No preaching tonight. No sermonising.

253
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:33,939
No sad faces or tears, just happiness.

254
00:22:34,574 --> 00:22:35,689
Tomorrow...

255
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:38,612
tomorrow is the last night
of our revival here,

256
00:22:38,745 --> 00:22:41,615
but when I leave,
you're going to carry on my work.

257
00:22:41,748 --> 00:22:45,496
You're all of you evangelists,
every blessed one of you.

258
00:22:45,627 --> 00:22:49,921
Shake hands with the person on your
right. Go on! Ask them if they're saved.

259
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:52,206
Won't you shake hands for Jesus?

260
00:22:52,342 --> 00:22:55,675
Bless you, brother.
Sing, everybody! Sing his praises!

261
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:59,172
- Sister Falconer!
- Won't you find happiness in Jesus?

262
00:22:59,307 --> 00:23:02,676
It's happiness to hear your wondrous
message. Can I have a moment?

263
00:23:02,811 --> 00:23:05,480
Excuse me, please. Excuse me.

264
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:08,681
- Excuse me, please.
- Thank you, brother.

265
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:12,731
Oh, uh, yes... Sorry. No change.

266
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:14,902
Thank you.

267
00:23:24,123 --> 00:23:26,163
(car horn)

268
00:23:33,174 --> 00:23:35,297
I picked some flowers for you.

269
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:39,424
Sister, my son saw the Virgin Mother
on the roof last night after your sermon.

270
00:23:39,556 --> 00:23:41,180
Can you spare me an hour?

271
00:23:41,307 --> 00:23:45,175
I simply can't. Aren't our counsellors
taking care of you? Sister Rachel?

272
00:23:45,311 --> 00:23:49,475
Sister Rachel, see what you can do. Every
one of these lovely people is important.

273
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:53,356
- May I have your names, please?
- I must congratulate you again.

274
00:23:53,486 --> 00:23:55,028
- Thank you.
- I'm a preacher.

275
00:23:55,155 --> 00:23:57,906
- I know how inspired you must've been.
- What church?

276
00:23:58,032 --> 00:24:01,781
What church? Well, uh, at present,
I don't exactly have a church, but...

277
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:04,485
What is it this time, brother?
Booze or women?

278
00:24:04,622 --> 00:24:07,113
Why, Sister Falconer. Me?

279
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:10,407
Whichever one it is,
you have my blessing. Jim?

280
00:24:10,545 --> 00:24:13,462
- Uh, Sister, I, uh...
- Nice try, brother.

281
00:24:20,472 --> 00:24:23,638
- Will prayer cure diabetes?
- Would you give me your address?

282
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:25,724
- Sister?
- Just a moment.

283
00:24:25,852 --> 00:24:28,010
- What denomination?
- I must talk to you.

284
00:24:28,146 --> 00:24:32,144
- If you'll just leave your name.
- I have an important message for you.

285
00:24:32,275 --> 00:24:34,481
A message? From Sister Falconer?

286
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:36,936
- I heard you sing last night.
- Oh?

287
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:40,238
I know flattery don't mean much
to a talented person like you,

288
00:24:40,366 --> 00:24:43,284
but when you sang that
inspiring song "Beulah Land",

289
00:24:43,411 --> 00:24:45,949
it made me realise that music
is the voice of love.

290
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,571
- Oh.
- And what is love?

291
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:51,460
Love is the morning and the evening star.

292
00:24:51,586 --> 00:24:54,670
America. A land of great opportunity.

293
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:58,249
Take me. I've been with the Central
States Appliance Company a year.

294
00:24:58,384 --> 00:25:02,762
I'm their crack salesman already. They
wanna make me a partner. It's a great life.

295
00:25:02,889 --> 00:25:08,096
Folks in 14 states know me by my
first name. Makes a fella feel humble.

296
00:25:08,228 --> 00:25:12,177
- Would you like to start with a cocktail?
- A cocktail in the middle of the day?

297
00:25:12,315 --> 00:25:16,858
Don't you know that drinkin' is sinful
and against the principles of Coolidge?

298
00:25:16,986 --> 00:25:18,267
I meant shrimp cocktail.

299
00:25:18,404 --> 00:25:21,192
Just bring us some of
Mother's apple pie and coffee.

300
00:25:21,324 --> 00:25:22,699
Yes, sir.

301
00:25:24,035 --> 00:25:26,028
I'm sorry.

302
00:25:27,121 --> 00:25:30,953
Tell me, when did you
first start servin' God?

303
00:25:31,084 --> 00:25:36,042
Two years ago. In Cato, Missouri. Sister
Sharon's gospel singer got hurt in a riot.

304
00:25:36,172 --> 00:25:39,707
A riot? In a Christian town like...
What was the name?

305
00:25:39,843 --> 00:25:41,088
Cato.

306
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:45,632
Cato, Missouri. Yes, some roughnecks
started yellin' and screamin' and hollerin'.

307
00:25:45,765 --> 00:25:47,176
During the services?

308
00:25:47,308 --> 00:25:52,551
Sister Sharon yelled to a farmer on our
side "Hit him one for the Lord, brother!"

309
00:25:52,689 --> 00:25:55,809
Apple pie. They ought to write
a song about apple pie.

310
00:25:55,942 --> 00:25:58,611
A gospel song. And you should sing it.

311
00:26:22,635 --> 00:26:24,758
(whistle blows)

312
00:26:24,888 --> 00:26:27,129
(conductor) All aboard!

313
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:40,775
- Godspeed the good work, Sister!
- Good luck, Sister Sharon!

314
00:26:40,904 --> 00:26:43,774
Godspeed, Sister Sharon! Good luck!

315
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,874
Shara?

316
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:05,336
Our advance man in Lincoln, Nebraska,
got drunk, and he's disappeared.

317
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,091
No more business tonight.

318
00:27:10,266 --> 00:27:14,560
- Thank heavens. When I didn't see you...
- Thinkin' about you every second.

319
00:27:14,687 --> 00:27:18,555
The fire department in Lincoln say
that we can't put up a tent our size.

320
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:22,392
- The church committee are bickering...
- Please, Bill.

321
00:27:23,488 --> 00:27:25,813
The gentleman with Sister Falconer.

322
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:27,609
- Mr Morgan?
- Yes.

323
00:27:27,742 --> 00:27:32,036
Tell him Mr Lefferts would like to see him
out back on the observation platform.

324
00:27:32,163 --> 00:27:34,203
Thank you, sir.

325
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:55,680
Mr Lefferts? My name is Gantry.

326
00:27:56,771 --> 00:27:58,479
Congratulations.

327
00:27:58,606 --> 00:28:01,276
- Sorry I woke you up.
- Then why did you do it?

328
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:03,228
Oh, I recognised you.

329
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:07,145
I had to congratulate you on those
articles you wrote about evolution.

330
00:28:07,448 --> 00:28:11,363
Not only scarifyin' and sensational,
but very funny.

331
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:17,912
Tell me somethin', Jim boy. I know
you got one of them Pulitzer prizes,

332
00:28:18,042 --> 00:28:21,791
but you don't really believe in
all that evolution junk, now do you?

333
00:28:21,921 --> 00:28:24,922
- Devoutly.
- Then you must believe

334
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:29,462
- that God himself is a gorilla.
- How did you arrive at that conclusion?

335
00:28:29,596 --> 00:28:33,296
It says in the Bible
"God created man in his own image."

336
00:28:45,445 --> 00:28:48,695
Sister Sharon -
she's pretty important news, eh?

337
00:28:49,574 --> 00:28:51,946
What's your interest in her?

338
00:28:54,204 --> 00:28:56,576
- Can I be frank with you?
- Try.

339
00:28:56,956 --> 00:29:00,824
- She fascinates me.
- You'll have to get in line.

340
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:05,291
You also have to get over
a hurdle first, name of Bill Morgan.

341
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:09,884
Say, I almost forgot. He's comin' out
to see you, right about now.

342
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:12,632
He's got some secret information.

343
00:29:18,645 --> 00:29:21,266
Thanks a lot, Jim boy. Thanks a lot.

344
00:29:29,614 --> 00:29:32,366
- You all right?
- Yes, fine. I was just wondering...

345
00:29:32,492 --> 00:29:34,734
Later, honey.

346
00:29:49,217 --> 00:29:51,542
I'm sorry, this seat is taken.

347
00:29:51,678 --> 00:29:54,085
Even the Lord never turned
his back on a sinner.

348
00:29:54,222 --> 00:29:58,089
I am not the Lord, but I am tired.
Now, will you please go away?

349
00:30:00,728 --> 00:30:05,604
You weren't so tired and all of life
two years ago in Cato, Missouri.

350
00:30:06,025 --> 00:30:09,560
- That's where we met.
- Met?

351
00:30:09,696 --> 00:30:12,862
Yes. On a Friday night, it was.
Remember? Remember the riot?

352
00:30:12,991 --> 00:30:17,451
Some roughnecks got to whoopin'
and hollerin' and fightin', and you yelled

353
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:20,200
- "Hit him one for the Lord!"
- That's what I said.

354
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:24,115
And that's exactly what I did.
I busted him one for the Lord.

355
00:30:24,252 --> 00:30:27,004
Oh, it was a lovely fight!

356
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:35,053
When I saw you in Cato, I thought I was
seein' an angel, and you haven't changed.

357
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,050
- A very tired angel.
- It's no wonder,

358
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:42,430
givin' everybody else hope and courage,
nobody to lean on yourself.

359
00:30:42,562 --> 00:30:46,061
I suppose this is a generous offer
to let me lean on you.

360
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,401
I wouldn't have the nerve, Sister.

361
00:30:50,528 --> 00:30:52,070
- Yesterday, Mr...
- Gantry.

362
00:30:52,197 --> 00:30:54,236
..you said you were a preacher.

363
00:30:54,365 --> 00:30:59,241
Well, uh, practically, yes. Uh, you see,
the semester I was to be ordained...

364
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,944
They kicked you out of college.

365
00:31:02,081 --> 00:31:05,497
Well, it was a... a tragedy, kind of.

366
00:31:05,627 --> 00:31:07,666
A girl.

367
00:31:08,588 --> 00:31:10,296
Yeah. A girl.

368
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,759
A girl named Lulu Bains.

369
00:31:13,885 --> 00:31:17,633
- Does she work for you, or you for her?
- We work together.

370
00:31:17,764 --> 00:31:22,805
Would it be unethical to ask just what
you'll write about Sister Sharon?

371
00:31:22,936 --> 00:31:25,059
- It would.
- Oh?

372
00:31:25,188 --> 00:31:27,857
- I'm sorry.
- She's brilliant.

373
00:31:27,982 --> 00:31:30,355
"Inspired" is a more appropriate word.

374
00:31:30,485 --> 00:31:34,020
- It means "touched by the hand of God".
- Precisely.

375
00:31:34,155 --> 00:31:36,362
Now, get the picture.

376
00:31:36,491 --> 00:31:41,034
It's Christmas Eve. God's pure snow
driftin' down, and joy in the air.

377
00:31:41,162 --> 00:31:45,326
I enter the Schoenheim church
late at night to pray for guidance.

378
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:48,495
And what do I find, right behind the altar?

379
00:31:48,628 --> 00:31:51,748
Lulu Bains, my betrothed, my bride-to-be,

380
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:57,255
half-naked, locked in the arms of
her lover, a cardsharp from Chicago.

381
00:31:58,346 --> 00:32:02,973
A couple of years later he was bumped
off in a gang war, God rest his soul.

382
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:06,517
Well, that's it, I guess.
I lost all interest in religion.

383
00:32:06,646 --> 00:32:09,137
But when I saw you,
it was like a call from beyond.

384
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:11,646
Could I see you again?
Have breakfast with me?

385
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,145
What's your hotel room number
in Lincoln, hm? Tell me.

386
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:21,116
You're so completely... so outrageous.
I... I think I like you.

387
00:32:21,244 --> 00:32:24,198
I guess I've been around
sanctimonious folks too long.

388
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:27,699
You're amusing,
and you smell like a real man.

389
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:33,246
Yes, I'll meet you by my tent.
That's where I breakfast. Good night.

390
00:32:33,381 --> 00:32:36,216
- Oh, but, Sister...
- Oh, this time I mean it.

391
00:32:37,886 --> 00:32:39,925
Pleasant dreams.

392
00:32:43,975 --> 00:32:49,811
Evening, Brother Morgan. Oh, I wouldn't
bother her now. She's resting, poor child.

393
00:32:56,446 --> 00:33:02,365
The wind will come from there, so keep
the centre poles where you've got them.

394
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:05,945
That way the canvas won't snap
and crackle all through the sermon.

395
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,120
Here they come.

396
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,045
Morning, Sister! Jim boy!
A lovely morning it is.

397
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:15,377
- Good morning.
- I woke with a terrific idea.

398
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:17,464
Later. Good morning, Captain.

399
00:33:17,592 --> 00:33:20,842
- You can't erect that tent here, ma'am.
- Why not?

400
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,928
- Fire laws.
- Nonsense.

401
00:33:23,056 --> 00:33:25,428
No, ma'am. No nonsense
at all. No, ma'am.

402
00:33:25,558 --> 00:33:28,393
"Ma'am" is a contraction for "madam".
I am not a madam,

403
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,019
a calibre of woman I'm sure you
know well and do business with.

404
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:34,722
How many have been put out
of business by fire laws?

405
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:38,727
- Your tent holds over 1,000 people...
- Captain, this is Mr Lefferts,

406
00:33:38,863 --> 00:33:43,157
- a reporter for the Zenith Times-DisPatch
- Zenith? Welcome. This is Fire Chief...

407
00:33:43,284 --> 00:33:47,033
Isn't it a fact, Mr Lefferts, that the whisky
big shots want me closed down?

408
00:33:47,163 --> 00:33:50,200
They certainly don't think
you do their business any good.

409
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:55,244
Know why? I'm not afraid to fight whisky
and repeal with police help or without it.

410
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,212
- If you're accusing me of not...
- I am. Do you enforce Prohibition?

411
00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:00,587
I certainly do.

412
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:04,134
How many speakeasies could you
take the captain to in his home town?

413
00:34:04,264 --> 00:34:07,929
- Without a membership card? 50.
- (Sharon) Fire laws!

414
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:10,384
Do you see any of my workmen smoking?

415
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,011
Do you mind? This might start a fire.

416
00:34:13,148 --> 00:34:16,682
- If they don't smoke inside...
- You're welcome to see tonight.

417
00:34:16,818 --> 00:34:20,234
A little bit of salvation
will do you both some good.

418
00:34:22,282 --> 00:34:27,193
Sister Sharon! Never did I ever see
anybody handle the cops the way you did.

419
00:34:27,328 --> 00:34:30,828
All right. What's this terrific idea
you woke up with?

420
00:34:30,957 --> 00:34:35,370
Yes, well... How would it be if I addressed
your meetin' as a saved businessman?

421
00:34:35,503 --> 00:34:38,837
I could talk on the hard,
practical dollars-and-cents value

422
00:34:38,965 --> 00:34:41,882
of Christ in commerce.

423
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,252
Tom, slacken off that rope. It's too tight.

424
00:34:44,387 --> 00:34:47,258
By the way, what is
your business? Hold-ups?

425
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:50,011
You're a card. I sell
for Central Appliances.

426
00:34:50,143 --> 00:34:53,559
- Don't you like your job?
- Why, sure. It's a great life.

427
00:34:53,688 --> 00:34:57,935
I'm their crack salesman. Only last month
they wanted to make me a junior partner.

428
00:34:58,067 --> 00:35:03,109
Would you believe that people in 14 states
call me by my first name? Elmer.

429
00:35:06,826 --> 00:35:10,491
No use kiddin' you, is there?
It's no life at all.

430
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:13,955
Filthy, dreary hotel rooms.
Always chasin' trains.

431
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:19,706
Always tellin' dirty stories
to keep the buyers laughin'.

432
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,208
Always the pint bottle
to prove you're a sport.

433
00:35:23,343 --> 00:35:28,384
That kind of fella's no success at all.
He's just a tramp in a silk shirt.

434
00:35:28,515 --> 00:35:30,139
Well...

435
00:35:33,561 --> 00:35:38,354
I could tell the sinners
I'm a... I'm a salesman, just like that.

436
00:35:39,776 --> 00:35:43,275
I come into one of them...
miserable hotel rooms.

437
00:35:44,364 --> 00:35:47,069
I'm discouraged.
I got no sales to chalk up.

438
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,987
Nothin' to read. I'm lonely.

439
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:55,780
I'm just dyin' for a drink. Some of them
salesmen drink somethin' terrible.

440
00:35:55,917 --> 00:36:00,912
And I reach my hand into
a dresser drawer... and what do I find?

441
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:04,877
A Gideon Bible. That's what I find.

442
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:07,679
Yes. Yes, go on.

443
00:36:08,888 --> 00:36:14,475
I reached my hand into a dresser drawer,
and I found a Gideon Bible.

444
00:36:14,602 --> 00:36:15,634
(man) Louder!

445
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,261
I found a Gideon Bible.

446
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:21,767
I was so lonely and miserable,
I might as well have been in hell.

447
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:25,401
I was in hell. I knew
all the salesman's tricks.

448
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,531
Why wasn't I rich?
Why wasn't I successful?

449
00:36:28,658 --> 00:36:32,276
I opened the Bible,
and I read the 18th Psalm.

450
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:36,410
"The Lord is my rock and my fortress."

451
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:40,411
"The Lord is my fortress."
Do you hear that? The Lord.

452
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:43,083
- Praise the Lord!
- The Lord is my rock!

453
00:36:43,214 --> 00:36:45,752
The next mornin'
I walked into a general store.

454
00:36:45,884 --> 00:36:48,920
"What are you sellin' today?
Gold-plated vacuum cleaners?"

455
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:52,713
"No, sir. You can get better vacuum
cleaners at Sears and Roebuck,

456
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:56,894
and you can get 'em cheaper, but
you can't beat our electric toasters."

457
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,725
He sat down and wrote me
the biggest order of the year.

458
00:36:59,856 --> 00:37:01,184
(man) Hallelujah!

459
00:37:01,649 --> 00:37:04,899
Can you hear me, Lord? Thank you, Lord.

460
00:37:05,028 --> 00:37:08,444
I didn't make that sale, Lord.
You did. Thank you.

461
00:37:11,784 --> 00:37:13,824
(man) Hallelujah!

462
00:37:14,787 --> 00:37:17,195
And when I told my pals...

463
00:37:17,332 --> 00:37:21,460
when I told my pals I was
comin' to Jesus, they laughed.

464
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:24,124
But Sister Falconer didn't laugh.

465
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:27,042
She said "Go ahead, brother.
Give 'em hell."

466
00:37:27,175 --> 00:37:29,666
I'm going to give you
all the hell in the Bible,

467
00:37:29,803 --> 00:37:33,717
and if you don't like it, fix it up with
the Lord because the Lord put it there.

468
00:37:33,848 --> 00:37:35,592
Listen to me, sinners.

469
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:37,682
Listen to me, sinners.

470
00:37:37,811 --> 00:37:42,722
You can't pray to kingdom come
and play bridge or poker. And, Mother,

471
00:37:42,857 --> 00:37:46,641
you can't say your psalms and look
at God through the bottom of a beer mug.

472
00:37:46,778 --> 00:37:47,809
And you, brother,

473
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:52,572
you can't go to church on Sunday
and cheat at business on Monday.

474
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,576
We're comin' back to you, God. We're
comin' back to the old-time religion!

475
00:38:01,793 --> 00:38:04,498
And what is religion?

476
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:06,752
What is religion?

477
00:38:06,881 --> 00:38:09,004
Religion is love.

478
00:38:09,134 --> 00:38:11,969
And love is the morning
and the evening star.

479
00:38:12,095 --> 00:38:14,847
Love, the eternal glorious musicmaker.

480
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:18,258
Love! Not the carnal love,
but the divine love.

481
00:38:18,393 --> 00:38:23,185
And where does this great love
come from? It comes direct from God!

482
00:38:27,443 --> 00:38:30,361
I admit I'm not smart like some of them...

483
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:34,533
some of them smart-alecky professors,
wise-guy writers and agitators.

484
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:38,787
I know nothing of theosophy, philosophy,
psychology, ideology or any other ology.

485
00:38:38,913 --> 00:38:40,621
But I know this.

486
00:38:40,748 --> 00:38:45,909
With Christ, you're saved,
and without him, you're lost.

487
00:38:46,045 --> 00:38:48,334
And how do I know
there's a merciful God?

488
00:38:48,464 --> 00:38:51,584
Because I've seen the devil
plenty of times!

489
00:39:06,274 --> 00:39:08,943
Any punk ball player
can make a slide like that.

490
00:39:09,068 --> 00:39:12,603
But how many folks have got the guts
to play ball on God's team?

491
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:18,160
And listen to this. The captain
of that team is Jesus Christ himself.

492
00:39:18,286 --> 00:39:20,326
So, come on, man, woman, child.

493
00:39:20,455 --> 00:39:23,906
Who'll be the first
to shake hands for Jesus?

494
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:26,582
Come on, now! Everyone!

495
00:39:29,797 --> 00:39:34,127
Are you gonna make me beg and beg
when I'm offerin' you my Jesus?

496
00:39:35,345 --> 00:39:39,841
Did the Saviour die in vain?
Did he suffer on the cross for nothin'?

497
00:39:39,974 --> 00:39:42,928
Argh! My God, I can't stand it!

498
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:45,386
Oh, my God, no! Not any more!

499
00:39:45,522 --> 00:39:49,733
Sinner, I'll fight you every day in the week
for God and twice on Sundays!

500
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:53,193
Help me. Brother Gantry, save me.
I sin every day!

501
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:56,488
Tell me what to do, please.
Tell me what to do!

502
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,321
- "Lifeline."
- (band Plays and PeoPle sing)

503
00:40:01,204 --> 00:40:03,909
? Throw out the lifeline

504
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:09,497
? Somebody's drifting away

505
00:40:09,629 --> 00:40:12,381
? Throw out the lifeline

506
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,212
? Throw out the lifeline

507
00:40:16,469 --> 00:40:19,256
Bless you for bringing us
such a wonderful man.

508
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:22,509
- Sister Sharon.
- Bless you, Brother Gantry.

509
00:40:22,642 --> 00:40:26,770
You've changed my whole life.
You're such a good man.

510
00:40:35,238 --> 00:40:37,943
- This light supposed to be kept burnin'?
- Yep.

511
00:40:38,074 --> 00:40:42,535
Sometimes folks come just to touch
where Sister Sharon stands.

512
00:40:43,496 --> 00:40:46,201
Say, I heard you talk tonight.

513
00:40:46,332 --> 00:40:50,496
- How'd you like it?
- Mister, I've been converted five times.

514
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:56,215
Billy Sunday, Reverend Biederwolf, Gypsy
Smith, and twice by Sister Falconer.

515
00:40:57,177 --> 00:41:00,759
I get terrible drunk,
and then I get good and saved.

516
00:41:00,889 --> 00:41:05,597
Both of them done me a powerful lot
of good - gettin' drunk, and gettin' saved.

517
00:41:05,727 --> 00:41:07,766
Well, good night.

518
00:41:23,077 --> 00:41:25,747
Are you praying, or planning to take over?

519
00:41:25,872 --> 00:41:27,496
Shara!

520
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:31,455
Did I do all right?
I mean, did I do all right for you?

521
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:34,753
Yes, you were fine. Really fine.
I cried like everybody else.

522
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:37,336
No, but... Tell me the truth, please.

523
00:41:37,467 --> 00:41:41,050
450 converts out of 1200 people?

524
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:43,717
That's a truth of some kind.

525
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:48,849
- Morgan thought you were vulgar.
- Do you?

526
00:41:48,978 --> 00:41:50,686
- Think I'm vulgar?
- Yes.

527
00:41:50,814 --> 00:41:52,224
- But you like me.
- Yes.

528
00:41:52,357 --> 00:41:54,599
- Very much.
- Not very much.

529
00:41:56,194 --> 00:41:57,818
Shara.

530
00:42:26,057 --> 00:42:27,255
Forgive me, Sharon.

531
00:42:27,392 --> 00:42:31,224
- You've got me plumb hypnotised.
- No, you're just hungry, that's all.

532
00:42:31,354 --> 00:42:34,355
But I can hypnotise, because
God chose me to do his work.

533
00:42:34,482 --> 00:42:36,807
- Sure, me too.
- No.

534
00:42:36,943 --> 00:42:41,237
I chose you. The big difference
between you and me is that I believe.

535
00:42:41,364 --> 00:42:43,404
I really believe.

536
00:42:45,702 --> 00:42:48,323
- You'd like to join us, wouldn't you?
- Oh, yes.

537
00:42:48,454 --> 00:42:52,404
- Report at nine. We'll discuss salaries...
- I got swell ideas for promotions.

538
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:56,290
- Radio, the third ear of the human race...
- You smoke, don't you?

539
00:42:56,421 --> 00:42:59,837
- Well...
- I can smell it. Will you stop it altogether?

540
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:01,875
- Well, yes...
- The drinking, too?

541
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,927
- Oh, sure. If that's what you want, I...
- It is.

542
00:43:05,054 --> 00:43:07,094
Good night.

543
00:43:16,608 --> 00:43:18,849
Evening, Brother Gantry.

544
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:25,363
Jim boy! Say, all the time Shara and me -
uh, Sister Falconer and me...

545
00:43:25,492 --> 00:43:28,113
Yep. Sitting right over there.

546
00:43:28,244 --> 00:43:33,535
- You're not gonna write about this?
- Boy kisses girl? Hell, that's not news.

547
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:37,878
You're slipping, brother. You know,
when you first hooked me on that train,

548
00:43:38,004 --> 00:43:43,509
I thought you were a friendly,
likeable, self-respecting first-class bum.

549
00:43:43,635 --> 00:43:47,467
And now... now look at you.
Where'd you get your style?

550
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:53,470
- Just let her rip, I guess.
- I've heard powerful Bible-wallopers,

551
00:43:53,603 --> 00:43:57,814
but you not only put the fear of God
into them, you scared the hell out of 'em.

552
00:43:57,941 --> 00:44:01,938
And the way you strung certain words
together - "America, home, mother".

553
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:05,486
"Heaven, hell... Love, hate, sin".

554
00:44:05,615 --> 00:44:11,071
You know, it's a funny thing, Jim.
I get up here and I... I see them out there.

555
00:44:12,372 --> 00:44:15,788
Next thing you know,
I'm howlin', they're moanin'.

556
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:18,455
It's like a mighty spirit
movin' inside of me.

557
00:44:18,586 --> 00:44:24,340
Words and ideas come pourin' out
like... like riled-up strangers.

558
00:44:24,467 --> 00:44:28,761
I feel so powerful and full of love,
I'm about to explode.

559
00:44:28,888 --> 00:44:30,928
I do explode.

560
00:44:31,057 --> 00:44:34,806
And then I just about love everybody

561
00:44:36,855 --> 00:44:39,096
Especially the girls.

562
00:44:41,985 --> 00:44:46,647
Yes, this is where I belong, all right.
Right here, in religion.

563
00:44:46,781 --> 00:44:48,821
Even if it is a tent.

564
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:51,523
Every circus needs a clown,
Brother Gantry.

565
00:44:51,661 --> 00:44:57,248
And you might turn out to be the funniest
clown of 'em all. And the most successful.

566
00:44:58,334 --> 00:44:59,959
Clown!

567
00:45:00,962 --> 00:45:03,168
Jim boy, you're terrific. Terrific.

568
00:45:09,804 --> 00:45:13,387
Some of them smart-aleck college
professors are trying to prove

569
00:45:13,516 --> 00:45:16,553
that this here ape is your
great-great-grandfather.

570
00:45:16,686 --> 00:45:19,094
Come back here. Let folks see you.

571
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,643
Well, he might be Darwin's uncle,
but he certainly ain't yours or mine.

572
00:45:23,776 --> 00:45:25,816
Right, Grandpop?

573
00:45:43,588 --> 00:45:46,755
Just a monkey, folks. Just a monkey.

574
00:45:48,009 --> 00:45:50,678
Would Jesus play poker?

575
00:45:50,804 --> 00:45:53,804
Would St Paul play the stock market?

576
00:45:53,932 --> 00:45:57,632
What do you think will get you
into God's own glorious heaven?

577
00:45:57,769 --> 00:45:59,892
This ace of spades?

578
00:46:00,021 --> 00:46:01,978
Your bank book?

579
00:46:02,106 --> 00:46:04,977
Or this pledge to be a good Christian?

580
00:46:07,821 --> 00:46:10,775
Sin, sin, sin.

581
00:46:10,907 --> 00:46:15,035
You're all sinners!
You're all doomed to perdition.

582
00:46:16,246 --> 00:46:20,326
You're all goin' to
the painful, stinkin', scaldin',

583
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:23,293
everlastin' tortures of a fiery hell,

584
00:46:23,419 --> 00:46:26,207
created by God for sinners, unless...

585
00:46:27,173 --> 00:46:28,881
unless...

586
00:46:29,008 --> 00:46:32,876
unless you repent!
Repent with Sister Falconer!

587
00:46:33,012 --> 00:46:35,052
(howls)

588
00:46:40,061 --> 00:46:42,433
(barks)

589
00:46:44,023 --> 00:46:46,693
Let that man alone! Let him alone!

590
00:46:47,527 --> 00:46:50,943
Go ahead and bark, brother.
Go right ahead and bark!

591
00:46:51,072 --> 00:46:55,070
There he is! The devil!
Bark that devil outta this tent!

592
00:46:55,702 --> 00:46:57,741
(rhythmic claPPing)

593
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:17,879
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

594
00:47:23,646 --> 00:47:27,098
(Morgan) ..the most disgusting display
of bad taste in my experience.

595
00:47:27,233 --> 00:47:30,982
A human barking dog.
A monkey in the pulpit.

596
00:47:31,112 --> 00:47:33,983
It's preposterous.
That's why it can't go on.

597
00:47:34,115 --> 00:47:39,026
And it's obvious to everyone - even
dangerous. Especially before Jim Lefferts.

598
00:47:39,162 --> 00:47:42,862
And our newspaper friend...
He's about as friendly as a rattlesnake.

599
00:47:42,999 --> 00:47:46,783
- Then you think it's wrong.
- Not wrong. Ridiculous.

600
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,790
One minute you're preaching
a happy, perfumed heaven,

601
00:47:49,923 --> 00:47:53,422
the next, Gantry's damning everyone
to a scalding, stinking hell.

602
00:47:53,551 --> 00:47:56,920
- I'd say we make a pretty good team.
- Yes.

603
00:47:57,055 --> 00:48:00,258
Yes, like two cops
working over a criminal.

604
00:48:00,391 --> 00:48:04,638
Gantry scares him with the electric chair,
you save him if he confesses.

605
00:48:04,979 --> 00:48:08,728
The point is, our sinner does confess,
and he is saved.

606
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:14,232
- (Morgan) But it was ridiculous.
- Does the method really matter?

607
00:48:16,366 --> 00:48:21,407
Who is this, uh, this Elmer Gantry?
And what do you really know about him?

608
00:48:22,997 --> 00:48:25,323
His background, his reputation?

609
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:29,207
What does he want?
Money? My job? You? What?

610
00:48:29,337 --> 00:48:32,753
- Bill...
- In 1917, Mr Gantry

611
00:48:32,882 --> 00:48:35,753
was expelled from
a theological seminary in Kansas

612
00:48:35,885 --> 00:48:38,637
for seducing
the deacon's daughter in the church

613
00:48:38,763 --> 00:48:42,677
where he had that day
delivered a Christmas sermon.

614
00:48:42,809 --> 00:48:45,382
And there's more. Do you wanna hear it?

615
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,845
Ta-da!

616
00:48:48,773 --> 00:48:51,893
Ladies and gentlemen,
you see before you a magic carpet.

617
00:48:52,026 --> 00:48:56,190
A heavenly summons.
A ticket to the big time. Listen to this.

618
00:48:56,322 --> 00:48:59,822
"Would you consider meeting with
the church committee and myself

619
00:48:59,951 --> 00:49:04,779
about bringing your revival to our fair city
of Zenith, capital of America's Midwest?"

620
00:49:04,914 --> 00:49:08,829
"Kindly telegraph reply immediately.
Signed, George F Babbitt, Secretary,

621
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,495
Zenith Chamber of Commerce,
Chairman of the Church Board."

622
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:13,460
Zenith.

623
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:16,507
- We're not ready for Zenith.
- Mr Babbitt thinks we are.

624
00:49:16,634 --> 00:49:19,801
I know we are. Next stop, Zenith.
Then Chicago, New York, London.

625
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:22,634
Straight to the top
on the Sharon Falconer Express!

626
00:49:22,765 --> 00:49:25,601
- In a tent? They'll laugh at us.
- Not at Shara.

627
00:49:25,727 --> 00:49:29,427
It's pitchman's talk. What do you know
about the background of our work?

628
00:49:29,564 --> 00:49:32,648
The nature of revivalism is rural.
It grew out of frontier life.

629
00:49:32,775 --> 00:49:36,144
- Big-city people are more cynical...
- They're more sinful, too.

630
00:49:36,279 --> 00:49:38,984
And more lonely
and more unhappy. And...

631
00:49:39,115 --> 00:49:41,737
And, Shara, they need you more.

632
00:49:44,496 --> 00:49:47,580
- I'm against this.
- Bill boy, you're an old sourpuss.

633
00:49:47,707 --> 00:49:51,657
- This is a passport to the Promised Land.
- Gantry, I am not your boy.

634
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:55,586
You deluded her, but to me,
everything about you's offensive.

635
00:49:55,715 --> 00:50:00,922
You're a crude, vulgar show-off, and
your vocabulary belongs in an outhouse.

636
00:50:09,646 --> 00:50:11,056
Crude.

637
00:50:11,189 --> 00:50:12,813
Vulgar.

638
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:19,060
Show-off, huh? You know something?
You're right, Bill. Let's put it this way.

639
00:50:19,364 --> 00:50:23,444
You're a five-dollar textbook.
Me, I'm a two-cent tabloid newspaper.

640
00:50:23,576 --> 00:50:25,652
You're too good for the people.

641
00:50:25,787 --> 00:50:29,785
I am the people. Sure, I'm common -
just like most people.

642
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:33,999
The common people put Christianity
on the map in the first place.

643
00:50:34,295 --> 00:50:38,589
What are you saying, Shara?
That you want to go to Zenith? Now?

644
00:50:39,884 --> 00:50:42,885
I wonder what God wants.

645
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:48,302
All right, Shara. All right.
Maybe you are ready for Zenith.

646
00:50:48,434 --> 00:50:52,764
- Thank you. I'll be with you in a minute.
- Just think of it, Shara. Zenith.

647
00:50:54,566 --> 00:50:57,483
I think the answer to Mr Babbitt
ought to come from you.

648
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:02,438
Tell 'em we're ready to talk, but they gotta
act fast. Only don't say it as crude as that.

649
00:51:02,574 --> 00:51:07,449
No, no. I'll use some of my
sweet-smelling five-buck words, huh?

650
00:51:07,579 --> 00:51:09,536
I knew we could work together.

651
00:51:09,664 --> 00:51:13,993
Gantry, uh... I just hope you don't
have any ideas about who's boss.

652
00:51:14,127 --> 00:51:15,751
Boss?

653
00:51:15,879 --> 00:51:19,164
Why, the boss is God.
I'm just his messenger boy.

654
00:51:20,592 --> 00:51:23,546
I'm sure God will be relieved.

655
00:51:23,678 --> 00:51:25,386
Yes.

656
00:51:25,513 --> 00:51:29,593
- Leave the money matters to me.
- If they get a guarantee, what do we get?

657
00:51:29,726 --> 00:51:32,015
- Why is cash necessary at all?
- Order!

658
00:51:32,145 --> 00:51:35,229
Gentlemen, without a guarantee,
a revival is impossible.

659
00:51:35,356 --> 00:51:36,103
Kee-rect!

660
00:51:36,232 --> 00:51:42,021
As chairman, I can say I want the revival,
but we're ministers, not financiers.

661
00:51:42,155 --> 00:51:44,860
- I agree. After all, $30,000...
- Will be raised.

662
00:51:44,991 --> 00:51:47,909
- How, Mr Babbitt?
- By decent, respectable people

663
00:51:48,036 --> 00:51:50,574
- who want to see old-time religion...
- I agree.

664
00:51:50,705 --> 00:51:52,863
- Please let me finish.
- Of course, George.

665
00:51:52,999 --> 00:51:54,992
- Thank you, Charlie.
- OK, then.

666
00:51:55,126 --> 00:51:57,451
Everybody knows that I contribute more

667
00:51:57,587 --> 00:52:01,585
to charity and poverty and things
than anybody, hm?

668
00:52:01,716 --> 00:52:06,212
Hey, now, didn't my real-estate company
give you that corner lot rent-free

669
00:52:06,346 --> 00:52:11,506
for your church baseball team, huh? Hm?
And I'm not even a Methodist! (laughs)

670
00:52:12,644 --> 00:52:18,231
All right, then. I always say, business
is business - that's the American way!

671
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:21,727
- Now, if you boys...
- Why do you want a revival in Zenith?

672
00:52:21,861 --> 00:52:26,108
Oh, I know what you're gettin' at, Phil.
You don't fool me for a second.

673
00:52:26,241 --> 00:52:29,989
- We're aware of the financial problems.
- Are we aware, sir?

674
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:33,405
- My church hasn't been painted for years.
- Whose fault is that?

675
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,449
What about the gymnasium?

676
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:38,786
In my area, getting milk for
the children is the problem.

677
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,921
Your problem is
empty churches, gentlemen.

678
00:52:42,048 --> 00:52:43,839
That is a fact.

679
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:47,383
The fact is that church attendance
is falling off everywhere.

680
00:52:47,512 --> 00:52:51,973
Sister Falconer can fill your churches.
That's why you're here in the first place.

681
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,927
- Kee-rect!
- Tea, Mr Babbitt?

682
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,928
- I always say, if you're sick, call a doctor.
- I agree.

683
00:52:58,064 --> 00:53:00,982
Now, uh, let's look at
the record, gentlemen.

684
00:53:01,109 --> 00:53:05,272
Sister Sharon has been in Lincoln -
this is going on the fifth week now.

685
00:53:05,405 --> 00:53:08,690
275 new church members,

686
00:53:08,825 --> 00:53:11,031
- in one church alone.
- My church.

687
00:53:11,161 --> 00:53:14,743
More than 2700
decisions for Christ, gentlemen.

688
00:53:14,873 --> 00:53:18,822
Actual converts who signed pledges.
Not our statistics,

689
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,795
but printed in
your own Zenith newspaper.

690
00:53:21,921 --> 00:53:25,705
And written up by... by Jim Lefferts,
a Pulitzer prizewinner.

691
00:53:25,842 --> 00:53:30,255
Does the record show how long your
converts remain church members?

692
00:53:30,889 --> 00:53:34,589
Well, I always say,
when in doubt, take action.

693
00:53:35,268 --> 00:53:36,513
- Let's vote.
- Second.

694
00:53:36,644 --> 00:53:37,676
- All in favour?
- Aye.

695
00:53:37,812 --> 00:53:40,434
- Uh, just a moment, please.
- You're out of order.

696
00:53:40,565 --> 00:53:43,732
- There's a motion on the floor.
- May I say something, please?

697
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,481
You have our...
undivided attention, Sister.

698
00:53:46,613 --> 00:53:51,773
Wouldn't it be a much happier world if
money was not the third arm of religion?

699
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:54,994
He can't paint his church.
You can't have your gymnasium.

700
00:53:55,121 --> 00:53:57,446
No child should be without milk.

701
00:53:57,749 --> 00:54:01,877
And my expenses are high enough to run
a factory - I practically do run a factory.

702
00:54:02,003 --> 00:54:06,748
Who do you think pays for my staff? The
musicians, the men who put up the tent.

703
00:54:06,883 --> 00:54:11,960
Truck transportations, railroad fares,
food bills. Advertising and printing bills.

704
00:54:12,096 --> 00:54:15,845
Electric bills, insurance bills, hotel bills.

705
00:54:15,975 --> 00:54:19,344
The church committees always
expect a contribution from me,

706
00:54:19,479 --> 00:54:25,268
and they always get it. And when I leave
town five weeks later, you get the benefit.

707
00:54:25,401 --> 00:54:29,102
You have the flock,
and I have to start all over again.

708
00:54:31,157 --> 00:54:34,491
No, gentlemen, you don't want a revival.

709
00:54:35,662 --> 00:54:38,532
And I'm afraid you don't want me, either.

710
00:54:48,508 --> 00:54:52,375
I think these gentlemen would like
a little privacy to kick things around.

711
00:54:52,512 --> 00:54:54,670
- Thank you, Mr Gantry.
- Excuse me.

712
00:54:54,806 --> 00:54:57,641
I'm not ashamed to admit
our churches are half-empty.

713
00:54:57,767 --> 00:55:00,970
- The ball parks are full.
- So are the races.

714
00:55:01,354 --> 00:55:02,433
Let's vote.

715
00:55:02,564 --> 00:55:06,264
Vote to do what? Marry the Church
to a three-ring circus?

716
00:55:06,401 --> 00:55:08,939
To barkers who say
they're messengers of God?

717
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:13,483
Who reduce frightened farmers to howling
dogs? All very entertaining, I'm sure.

718
00:55:13,616 --> 00:55:16,820
We are in competition
with the entertainment business.

719
00:55:16,953 --> 00:55:19,824
- I'm not.
- Then you ought to be. Huh?

720
00:55:20,915 --> 00:55:22,742
How about your bingo games?

721
00:55:22,876 --> 00:55:25,876
And how about your baseball games
and square dances?

722
00:55:26,004 --> 00:55:28,921
Now, ain't that entertainment?
What's the difference?

723
00:55:29,048 --> 00:55:33,129
It's up to us to make a success out of
Christianity, keep the churches full.

724
00:55:33,511 --> 00:55:37,094
What has religion
to do with filling churches?

725
00:55:37,223 --> 00:55:40,639
Once there were only
13 Christians in the entire world.

726
00:55:40,768 --> 00:55:44,184
Was Christianity a failure?
Did God go out of business?

727
00:55:44,314 --> 00:55:50,269
Kee-rect! Christianity is a going concern,
a successful international enterprise.

728
00:55:50,778 --> 00:55:53,400
If you boys don't get
young people back into church,

729
00:55:53,531 --> 00:55:56,201
if you don't keep the train on the tracks,

730
00:55:56,326 --> 00:56:00,026
your church boards are gonna
find somebody else who will.

731
00:56:00,163 --> 00:56:02,832
Isn't that clear, Reverend Garrison?

732
00:56:08,713 --> 00:56:12,925
Speaking for myself,
not my congregation or its church board,

733
00:56:13,051 --> 00:56:16,883
religion is not a business.
And revivalism is not religion.

734
00:56:17,013 --> 00:56:19,053
And my vote is no.

735
00:56:20,975 --> 00:56:23,727
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Phil!

736
00:56:24,103 --> 00:56:25,728
Harvard!

737
00:56:26,606 --> 00:56:31,813
Well, look around you, boys. Young folks
crying out they're the lost generation.

738
00:56:31,945 --> 00:56:37,283
Godless anarchists on every street
corner, and he walks out on a crisis.

739
00:56:37,408 --> 00:56:42,201
Do you realise that practically
every president of the United States

740
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:44,239
was a Mason and a Protestant?

741
00:56:44,374 --> 00:56:47,043
And every session of Congress
opens with a word

742
00:56:47,168 --> 00:56:49,659
from the King James version of the Bible.

743
00:56:49,796 --> 00:56:54,672
And right now, in our enlightened age,
a Catholic is running for president.

744
00:56:54,801 --> 00:56:56,295
- Mr Babbitt...
- And...

745
00:56:56,427 --> 00:56:57,838
Mr Babbitt!

746
00:56:59,097 --> 00:57:01,339
Don't say another word.

747
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,511
George, I agree with you.

748
00:57:09,649 --> 00:57:12,318
Please, John.
If revivalism can do the job...

749
00:57:12,443 --> 00:57:13,772
Paul.

750
00:57:13,903 --> 00:57:18,612
Zenith had a revival 40 years ago.
It saved everybody in sight for miles,

751
00:57:18,741 --> 00:57:21,363
but today we still have
the same problems.

752
00:57:21,494 --> 00:57:23,653
Please, John.

753
00:57:23,788 --> 00:57:24,951
Please.

754
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:27,246
(Babbitt) Order, order. Now, now, now.

755
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:31,289
Gentlemen, if you'll only
leave the money matters to me.

756
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:34,752
Kee-rect!

757
00:57:34,883 --> 00:57:36,922
(knocking at door)

758
00:57:43,016 --> 00:57:46,848
- Welcome to Zenith, Sister.
- Congratulations. A wise decision.

759
00:57:46,978 --> 00:57:52,185
Gentlemen, all your churches will be
closed while the revival is in progress.

760
00:58:18,343 --> 00:58:22,257
- Great folks, aren't they?
- Swell, George, just swell.

761
00:58:33,316 --> 00:58:38,393
When Sister Falconer says "Shake hands
for Jesus", the chorus starts singing.

762
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:42,823
- Brother Gantry...
- Just a sec. Ushers wear these badges.

763
00:58:42,951 --> 00:58:45,905
The minute folks start comin' in,
you go into action.

764
00:58:46,037 --> 00:58:50,366
Keep 'em movin'. Get pledge cards into
their hands, and don't forget the pencils.

765
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:54,711
Now, you counsellors, you'll wear
these lapel pennants. Pretty, eh?

766
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:58,503
German-speaking, hold up your hands.
Swedish-speaking? Fine.

767
00:58:58,633 --> 00:59:01,753
Ask if they're regular church
members. Also, what church.

768
00:59:01,886 --> 00:59:07,047
And it don't matter what church. Now,
some folks are gonna wanna cry. Let 'em.

769
00:59:09,269 --> 00:59:10,811
"God is love."

770
00:59:10,937 --> 00:59:12,728
Jim-dandy, huh?

771
00:59:12,856 --> 00:59:16,805
Well, that's it, I guess.
Tonight's the big night.

772
00:59:16,943 --> 00:59:20,775
Are we gonna make a touchdown for
Jesus Christ? Any further questions?

773
00:59:20,905 --> 00:59:24,274
- Brother Gantry...
- OK, then. At 7.30, we hit the line.

774
00:59:24,409 --> 00:59:28,157
God is love. Sister Sharon's sanctuary.
May I help you?

775
00:59:28,288 --> 00:59:31,372
Yes, sir, that's right.
Every evening at 8.30.

776
00:59:31,499 --> 00:59:34,868
Yes, you may take a trolley car.
The line's 14th Street.

777
00:59:35,003 --> 00:59:38,952
Yes. Yes, I understand.
Well, if you're lonesome and restless,

778
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:43,633
Sister Sharon recommends that
you read Psalm 23 or Psalm 27.

779
00:59:46,598 --> 00:59:49,883
Do you know of a better
product to sell than God?

780
00:59:51,644 --> 00:59:53,933
Uh, Sister, one more question.

781
00:59:54,063 --> 00:59:56,851
- I'm sorry, what was that question again?
- I said...

782
00:59:56,983 --> 00:59:59,854
Sister, in what branch
of the Church were you baptised?

783
00:59:59,986 --> 01:00:02,228
Hold it, Sister!

784
01:00:02,363 --> 01:00:06,147
Sister, I'm afraid you have a problem
with the fire department again.

785
01:00:06,284 --> 01:00:08,193
- The fire department?!
- Bill!

786
01:00:08,328 --> 01:00:11,245
- I've got the chief on the phone.
- Oh, Sister...

787
01:00:11,372 --> 01:00:14,124
- Excuse me.
- ..could I just ask one more question?

788
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:17,536
What you'll be wearing
for the opening night?

789
01:00:19,756 --> 01:00:23,540
You looked as if you had about enough
of "who, what, when, where".

790
01:00:23,676 --> 01:00:25,716
Thank you.

791
01:00:27,388 --> 01:00:29,844
May I have some water, please?

792
01:00:33,394 --> 01:00:36,099
- You tired?
- Oh, these last two days.

793
01:00:39,651 --> 01:00:42,106
The aspirin age.

794
01:00:42,237 --> 01:00:45,107
Nervous about opening tomorrow night?

795
01:00:48,034 --> 01:00:51,284
- I don't know.
- What about Gantry?

796
01:00:53,248 --> 01:00:57,080
He's got all the nerve
in the world, but no nerves.

797
01:00:59,546 --> 01:01:04,884
You want to know the truth?
I'm scared to death of you city people.

798
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:09,588
Don't be. The women will worship you,
and the men will love you.

799
01:01:10,598 --> 01:01:12,924
And you?

800
01:01:13,059 --> 01:01:15,182
I'll be there, too.

801
01:01:17,647 --> 01:01:20,055
Good night.

802
01:01:20,567 --> 01:01:22,191
Good night.

803
01:01:26,823 --> 01:01:31,734
Just as sure as God plagued the earth
with pestilence and locusts,

804
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:34,491
you and I... to doom!

805
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:40,746
I tell you, the end of the world is comin'.
It's coming this September 15th!

806
01:01:40,879 --> 01:01:45,587
- It says so in the Bible!
- Revivals are against organised labour!

807
01:01:45,717 --> 01:01:48,208
(congregation sings "Marching to Zion")

808
01:01:55,602 --> 01:01:58,721
(college boys sing
"The Star-SPangled Banner")

809
01:02:08,156 --> 01:02:12,782
Hallelujah! The Lord's name be praised!
Stop it, you scallywags! Stop!

810
01:02:26,132 --> 01:02:29,501
Come on, boys.
All right, the locomotive. Here we go.

811
01:02:29,636 --> 01:02:31,628
(whistle) Boom!

812
01:02:32,263 --> 01:02:34,303
(whistle) Boom!

813
01:02:35,016 --> 01:02:38,302
- Sis-boom, Sister!
- Play Sister's introduction.

814
01:02:38,436 --> 01:02:40,310
Sis-boom, Sister!

815
01:02:40,438 --> 01:02:42,680
(band Plays)

816
01:02:42,816 --> 01:02:44,393
Captain Holt!

817
01:02:44,526 --> 01:02:46,602
(? "The Battle Hymn of the RePublic")

818
01:02:46,736 --> 01:02:49,061
Arrest them. Arrest all of them.

819
01:02:49,197 --> 01:02:53,859
I don't know who started the fuss inside.
The ones outside ain't breakin' any laws.

820
01:02:53,993 --> 01:02:57,445
- First arrest them. Then we'll find out...
- I wouldn't do that.

821
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,537
You wanna start a riot?

822
01:02:59,666 --> 01:03:03,200
Folks have gotta have
stretchin' room for their feelings.

823
01:03:03,336 --> 01:03:07,797
Now, why don't you sit down
and get close to God? lt'll be all right.

824
01:03:07,924 --> 01:03:08,706
It's OK.

825
01:03:08,842 --> 01:03:13,338
? Glory, glory, hallelujah

826
01:03:13,555 --> 01:03:17,504
? Glory, glory, hallelujah

827
01:03:17,642 --> 01:03:23,229
? His truth is marching on

828
01:03:23,356 --> 01:03:27,769
? Glory, glory, hallelujah

829
01:03:27,986 --> 01:03:32,648
? Glory, glory, hallelujah

830
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:41,198
- They're ready for you, Shara.
- You certainly promoted us into Zenith.

831
01:03:41,332 --> 01:03:45,377
You certainly filled our tent,
didn't you? But with what?

832
01:03:45,503 --> 01:03:49,501
You and your people.
Those aren't people. They're a mob.

833
01:03:49,632 --> 01:03:54,590
They're one big animal. I'm not letting
Shara go out there to be humiliated.

834
01:03:54,721 --> 01:03:58,801
And what's your plan? To run?
Where? Back to the sticks?

835
01:03:58,933 --> 01:04:02,978
If we don't win them over tonight,
there'll be no place to run.

836
01:04:03,104 --> 01:04:06,972
- Shara, you've got to face them.
- And do what? Blow them kisses?

837
01:04:07,108 --> 01:04:11,936
Tell them all to be nice little boys
and girls? No, Gantry. No. No.

838
01:04:12,071 --> 01:04:15,986
Zenith is your idea.
Those are your people. You face 'em.

839
01:04:23,249 --> 01:04:24,827
They want Shara.

840
01:04:26,836 --> 01:04:28,912
Listen to me, Shara.

841
01:04:29,047 --> 01:04:32,131
Big-city people have got
a coat of hard varnish,

842
01:04:32,258 --> 01:04:36,090
but underneath, they're just as sick
and scared as anybody else.

843
01:04:36,221 --> 01:04:41,595
People everywhere are the same
in one thing - they're all afraid to die.

844
01:04:41,726 --> 01:04:45,225
They hope you can save them.
And you can, Shara.

845
01:04:46,898 --> 01:04:48,937
You can.

846
01:04:49,692 --> 01:04:52,148
You can, Shara.

847
01:04:52,278 --> 01:04:54,567
You can.

848
01:04:54,697 --> 01:04:56,737
You can, Shara.

849
01:04:58,243 --> 01:05:00,282
You can.

850
01:05:04,123 --> 01:05:07,872
(college boys) Hip, hip, hooray!
Hip, hip, hooray!

851
01:05:08,002 --> 01:05:10,244
Hip, hip, hooray!

852
01:05:11,464 --> 01:05:13,504
(boys cheer)

853
01:05:23,434 --> 01:05:25,676
(singing dies out)

854
01:06:00,263 --> 01:06:02,635
Some of you are troubled.

855
01:06:04,726 --> 01:06:06,683
Sceptical...

856
01:06:06,811 --> 01:06:08,851
of my motives.

857
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,646
You want to know my credentials.

858
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:15,152
Who am I?

859
01:06:15,778 --> 01:06:18,020
Who sent me?

860
01:06:18,615 --> 01:06:22,031
Some of you have come
to sit in judgement of me.

861
01:06:23,536 --> 01:06:28,779
But who among you is wise enough
to be a judge in the house of God?

862
01:06:30,877 --> 01:06:36,084
For even though you speak with the
tongue of an angel and have not charity,

863
01:06:36,216 --> 01:06:38,671
you are as sounding brass.

864
01:06:41,888 --> 01:06:43,927
If I have sinned...

865
01:06:45,558 --> 01:06:47,800
then God will punish me.

866
01:06:50,271 --> 01:06:53,640
If I am lost in the wilderness,

867
01:06:53,775 --> 01:06:56,645
then God will show me the way back.

868
01:06:59,322 --> 01:07:01,991
Will you pray with me for guidance?

869
01:07:03,743 --> 01:07:05,985
Will you?

870
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:11,408
God won't mind if you get
a little dirt on your knees!

871
01:07:11,543 --> 01:07:14,116
(old man) I believe in you, Sister.

872
01:07:14,629 --> 01:07:18,247
- Oh, bless you, brother.
- I believe in you, Sister.

873
01:07:18,383 --> 01:07:21,503
(choir sings "What a Friend
We Have in Jesus")

874
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:26,589
No. No. No music.

875
01:07:27,183 --> 01:07:30,433
Please. Please, no singing, no music.

876
01:07:30,562 --> 01:07:32,601
Let us just pray.

877
01:07:33,898 --> 01:07:36,140
Will you pray with me?

878
01:08:00,717 --> 01:08:02,756
Dearest God...

879
01:08:10,185 --> 01:08:13,139
Are you too proud to kneel, Mr Lefferts?

880
01:08:14,397 --> 01:08:17,398
You may not believe in God...

881
01:08:17,525 --> 01:08:19,981
but God believes in you.

882
01:08:44,677 --> 01:08:46,717
Dear God...

883
01:08:50,683 --> 01:08:54,017
I am set upon by enemies
and I know not why.

884
01:08:56,272 --> 01:09:01,515
The Lord has said "He that believeth
on me believeth not on me...

885
01:09:02,904 --> 01:09:05,146
but on him that sent me."

886
01:09:07,575 --> 01:09:10,742
"And if any man hear my words
and believe not...

887
01:09:12,205 --> 01:09:17,163
I judge him not.
For I came not to judge the world,

888
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:20,248
but to save the world."

889
01:09:22,298 --> 01:09:24,540
Now is my soul troubled.

890
01:09:26,678 --> 01:09:28,884
But what shall I say?

891
01:09:30,348 --> 01:09:33,017
Shall I say "Father, save me"?

892
01:09:35,687 --> 01:09:40,645
But it is for this cause
that I came unto this hour.

893
01:09:47,365 --> 01:09:50,816
- Dearly beloved...
- (congregation) Dearly beloved...

894
01:09:50,952 --> 01:09:54,286
..avenge not yourselves, for it is written...

895
01:09:54,414 --> 01:09:55,825
..for it is written...

896
01:09:55,957 --> 01:09:59,077
- ..if thine enemy hunger...
- ..if thine enemy hunger...

897
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:01,582
- ..feed him.
- ..feed him.

898
01:10:01,713 --> 01:10:04,334
- If he thirst...
- If he thirst...

899
01:10:04,465 --> 01:10:06,754
- ..give him drink.
- ..give him drink.

900
01:10:08,678 --> 01:10:13,174
- Be not overcome with evil...
- Be not overcome with evil...

901
01:10:13,308 --> 01:10:16,593
..but overcome evil with good.

902
01:10:16,811 --> 01:10:20,227
..but overcome evil with good.

903
01:10:20,356 --> 01:10:21,352
Amen.

904
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:24,483
? Glory, glory, hallelujah

905
01:10:24,611 --> 01:10:28,443
? His truth is marching on

906
01:10:30,575 --> 01:10:32,614
(man) Hallelujah!

907
01:10:36,706 --> 01:10:38,746
Hallelujah, Sister!

908
01:10:54,933 --> 01:10:56,806
- Brother Gantry...
- Sister Rachel.

909
01:11:00,814 --> 01:11:03,221
She'll be out in a moment.

910
01:11:03,358 --> 01:11:06,193
Didn't I tell you?
Didn't I spot her genius first?

911
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:09,688
There's been nothing like her
since Joan of Arc! I always say -

912
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:15,113
and you can quote me on this one, boys -
there's nothing succeeds like success.

913
01:11:15,245 --> 01:11:18,779
- Let's get 'em outta here.
- A triumph over doubt and dissension.

914
01:11:18,915 --> 01:11:22,165
- Biggest thing in Christianity.
- Can I have a picture?

915
01:11:22,293 --> 01:11:25,164
Not me, and Sister's had
a tryin' ordeal, but thank you.

916
01:11:25,296 --> 01:11:27,538
I was saying, if it doesn't get you here...

917
01:11:27,674 --> 01:11:31,256
The poor child's practically out
on her feet. Let's give her a break.

918
01:11:31,386 --> 01:11:35,466
Sure. Sure. Sure. Come on, boys, let's
give the little lady a break, shall we?

919
01:11:35,598 --> 01:11:40,141
Time to say good night. We appreciated
all of you. Thanks for your cooperation.

920
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:41,930
Good night, Sister.

921
01:11:43,523 --> 01:11:45,266
- Good night, Mr Morgan.
- Good night.

922
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,108
- Good night, Bill.
- Mr Babbitt.

923
01:11:47,235 --> 01:11:51,731
- Never have made it without you.
- Thanks, Elmer. Good night. Good night.

924
01:11:51,865 --> 01:11:53,822
- Brother Gantry...
- Sister Rachel.

925
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:57,485
Here's a young lady who deserves
your attention - our maestro of music.

926
01:11:57,620 --> 01:12:00,290
Captain Holt - a real Trojan.
Thank you. Good night.

927
01:12:00,415 --> 01:12:03,369
- Thank you, sir.
- Bill, I'll see if she needs anything.

928
01:12:03,501 --> 01:12:05,873
Gantry... thank you.

929
01:12:06,713 --> 01:12:08,373
Bill boy.

930
01:12:08,506 --> 01:12:11,176
- Yes. Yes.
- Good night.

931
01:12:11,301 --> 01:12:13,009
Bill boy. Yes.

932
01:12:13,136 --> 01:12:15,378
- Good night.
- Good night.

933
01:12:31,196 --> 01:12:32,820
Shara?

934
01:12:34,365 --> 01:12:36,405
Are you decent?

935
01:13:12,862 --> 01:13:14,902
Zenith Times-DisPatch? Just a moment.

936
01:13:15,031 --> 01:13:17,949
Slug this "Lead all, article one."

937
01:13:18,076 --> 01:13:20,911
Revivalism came to Zenith last night.

938
01:13:21,037 --> 01:13:26,162
After six years of backwoods success,
Sister Sharon Falconer -

939
01:13:26,292 --> 01:13:28,997
F-A-L-C-O-N-E-R -

940
01:13:29,128 --> 01:13:33,209
faced a fractious,
overflowing, metropolitan crowd.

941
01:13:33,341 --> 01:13:35,879
- Paragraph.
- (Phone rings)

942
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:38,133
Jim Lefferts. Uh, later, please.

943
01:13:38,263 --> 01:13:40,635
- "Metropolitan crowd."
- Um...

944
01:13:40,765 --> 01:13:43,173
Many came to jeer...

945
01:13:43,309 --> 01:13:45,765
but stayed to cheer.

946
01:13:45,895 --> 01:13:50,688
Sister Sharon tamed the Philistines
with a simple prayer.

947
01:13:51,943 --> 01:13:56,404
The big-city hicks swallowed the
chocolate-coated pill with hosannas.

948
01:13:56,531 --> 01:14:00,149
- Give me a start on that, would you?
- Yeah, yeah.

949
01:14:00,285 --> 01:14:01,909
But...

950
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:07,207
if simple prayer was
the main attraction of revivalism...

951
01:14:10,587 --> 01:14:16,173
Sister's tent would soon be as empty
as the churches she claims she can fill.

952
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:18,885
Paragraph.

953
01:14:22,807 --> 01:14:25,477
What... is a revival?

954
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:30,604
Is it a church? Is it a religion?

955
01:14:33,318 --> 01:14:36,069
Or is it a circus sideshow

956
01:14:36,196 --> 01:14:39,362
complete with freaks, magic,

957
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:41,697
and rabble-rousing?

958
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:49,281
Why does a revival attract thousands?

959
01:14:49,417 --> 01:14:53,664
To see a miracle? To be saved from
a lifetime of sin in five minutes?

960
01:14:53,796 --> 01:14:58,126
To be entertained, cured, cuddled,
in quick, painless salvation?

961
01:14:58,259 --> 01:14:59,884
Paragraph.

962
01:15:01,137 --> 01:15:06,262
Zenith is the heart of the Bible Belt. This
is an age that likes noise and whoopee.

963
01:15:06,392 --> 01:15:08,930
We're a fertile land
for corn, beans, squash,

964
01:15:09,062 --> 01:15:13,890
rumble-seat sex, and revivalism.
Hallelujah, brother.

965
01:15:16,903 --> 01:15:22,110
(Lefferts) What qualifies someone to be
a revivalist? Nothing Nothing at all

966
01:15:22,242 --> 01:15:24,815
There is not one law
in any state in the Union

967
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:28,701
Protecting the Public from the
hysterical onslaught of revivalists

968
01:15:28,832 --> 01:15:33,292
But the law does Permit them
to invest in tax-free ProPerty,

969
01:15:33,419 --> 01:15:37,631
and collect money,
without accounting for how it is used

970
01:15:38,842 --> 01:15:41,511
What do you get for your money?
Can you get into heaven

971
01:15:41,636 --> 01:15:44,423
by contributing one buck or 50?

972
01:15:44,556 --> 01:15:48,719
Can you get life eternal by shaking hands
for Jesus with Elmer Gantry?

973
01:15:48,852 --> 01:15:51,425
"Continued on page three."

974
01:15:52,397 --> 01:15:54,021
So...

975
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:59,605
"I watched this unholy trinity - Falconer,
Gantry, Morgan - save Nebraska."

976
01:15:59,737 --> 01:16:05,527
"Has sin in that state been washed away?
Is there less envy, lust or adultery?"

977
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:07,202
- Ah.
- Gee, I hope not.

978
01:16:07,328 --> 01:16:10,495
- Break it up. A party of johns want action.
- Keep readin', honey.

979
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:13,293
- But, Lulu, they'll be right over.
- Drop dead!

980
01:16:13,418 --> 01:16:16,123
- Cigarette me, Pete, honey.
- Honey, read!

981
01:16:16,921 --> 01:16:23,256
"To Elmer Gantry, God is an all-American
football player with a long white beard,

982
01:16:23,386 --> 01:16:27,598
who carries lightning in one hand,
and a bag of tricks in the other."

983
01:16:27,724 --> 01:16:31,638
"And Gantry has the high-pressure
style and personality to sell this God

984
01:16:31,769 --> 01:16:34,723
even to big-city slickers."

985
01:16:35,523 --> 01:16:38,608
"He can make
innocent people feel guilty...

986
01:16:39,486 --> 01:16:42,190
and bad people feel good."

987
01:16:42,322 --> 01:16:45,026
"Gantry has a voice made for promises."

988
01:16:45,158 --> 01:16:48,075
- Can he save anybody?
- Can he?

989
01:16:51,164 --> 01:16:55,114
Can he? Anywhere, any time.

990
01:16:55,251 --> 01:16:59,629
In a tent, standin' up,
layin' down, or any other way.

991
01:16:59,756 --> 01:17:02,081
And he's got plenty of ways!

992
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:05,420
Lulu? Was you saved
by him, Lulu, honey?

993
01:17:05,553 --> 01:17:10,096
Sister, I was saved by him
way back in Schoenheim, Kansas.

994
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:14,721
"Love... love is the mornin'
and the evenin' star."

995
01:17:14,854 --> 01:17:20,145
"And what is love?
Not the carnal, but the divine love!"

996
01:17:20,276 --> 01:17:23,811
Oh, he gave me special instructions
back of the pulpit Christmas Eve.

997
01:17:23,947 --> 01:17:26,698
He got to howlin' "Repent. Repent!"

998
01:17:26,825 --> 01:17:29,779
And I got to moanin' "Save me. Save me."

999
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:34,869
He rammed the fear of God into me so
fast I never heard my old man's footsteps.

1000
01:17:34,999 --> 01:17:40,160
The next thing I knew, I was out in the
cold, hard snow in my bare little soul.

1001
01:17:41,798 --> 01:17:44,668
Oh, Brother Gantry, save me!

1002
01:17:55,270 --> 01:18:00,311
Don't do it, Shara. Don't get yourself
mixed up in an alley fight. Listen to me...

1003
01:18:00,441 --> 01:18:02,066
(click)

1004
01:18:04,863 --> 01:18:06,820
Why, Georgie, hello!

1005
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:10,697
- You shut up. I am crucified to pieces.
- What's the matter?

1006
01:18:10,827 --> 01:18:14,362
What's the matter? "Why did
George F Babbitt underwrite a guarantee

1007
01:18:14,497 --> 01:18:16,822
of $30,000 to bring a revival to Zenith?"

1008
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:19,793
"Is Sister Sharon
preaching the word of Jesus

1009
01:18:19,919 --> 01:18:23,371
or the gospel of Babbitt's
real-estate business?"

1010
01:18:23,506 --> 01:18:26,591
For God's sakes! I don't want any trouble.

1011
01:18:26,718 --> 01:18:30,466
I am in business.
I'm a 32nd-degree Mason.

1012
01:18:30,597 --> 01:18:33,301
George boy, don't take
this thing so seriously!

1013
01:18:33,433 --> 01:18:37,217
- I just sure as hell don't think it's a joke!
- We'll lick it, Georgie!

1014
01:18:37,353 --> 01:18:40,189
"Georgie!" My telephone
has not stopped ringing.

1015
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:44,609
Everybody's mad at me or laughing at me.
Even my own family's turned against me.

1016
01:18:44,736 --> 01:18:46,360
As of right now,

1017
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:50,984
I am cancelling out on my support -
financial and every other way.

1018
01:18:51,117 --> 01:18:53,691
George, you've got to fight back!

1019
01:18:56,664 --> 01:18:58,574
- Fight the press?
- Yes.

1020
01:18:58,708 --> 01:19:01,709
Mister, do you know anybody
ever licked the newspapers?

1021
01:19:01,836 --> 01:19:04,161
Me and you.

1022
01:19:04,297 --> 01:19:08,758
Besides, I am for a free press,
and for free enterprise,

1023
01:19:08,885 --> 01:19:12,420
and for... whatever the hell
the other freedoms are!

1024
01:19:12,555 --> 01:19:14,844
But, Reverend, you invited us here.

1025
01:19:14,974 --> 01:19:19,352
If you withdraw your support now, you're
endorsing this vicious newspaper smear.

1026
01:19:19,479 --> 01:19:21,970
- These telegrams of protest...
- There's always a lunatic fringe...

1027
01:19:22,106 --> 01:19:26,982
These are from my parishioners. These
are complaints from my church board.

1028
01:19:27,111 --> 01:19:30,563
Even my national superior
telephoned me long-distance.

1029
01:19:30,698 --> 01:19:32,774
I'm sorry, Mr Morgan.

1030
01:19:32,909 --> 01:19:35,993
- If you turn against us now...
- What I do doesn't matter.

1031
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:39,489
Public opinion has turned against you.
That does matter.

1032
01:19:39,624 --> 01:19:43,242
- Tell him it's Sister Sharon Falconer.
- (knocking at door)

1033
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:45,999
- No, I'll wait.
- (knocking)

1034
01:19:48,174 --> 01:19:51,009
- Did you find Mr Gantry?
- Nobody's seen him since he left.

1035
01:19:51,136 --> 01:19:53,805
- His hotel room?
- Hasn't been there all day.

1036
01:19:54,889 --> 01:19:57,427
Yes? Mr Eddington?

1037
01:19:58,476 --> 01:20:01,810
I want to see you. No, sir, at once.

1038
01:20:02,897 --> 01:20:07,643
No, your office will be fine.
Will you please have Mr Lefferts there?

1039
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:10,442
Thank you.

1040
01:20:11,865 --> 01:20:15,280
Maybe... something
happened to Mr Gantry.

1041
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:16,690
Forget Mr Gantry.

1042
01:20:41,019 --> 01:20:43,973
- Evening, George.
- I'm busy.

1043
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:48,601
I had a busy day myself.
736 Lombard Street, two-storey building.

1044
01:20:48,735 --> 01:20:51,689
Owner: George F Babbitt.
Tenant: speakeasy.

1045
01:20:51,821 --> 01:20:56,198
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Of course. 1121 Maple Street.

1046
01:20:56,326 --> 01:20:59,576
Store front, apartment in rear.
Owner: George F Babbitt.

1047
01:20:59,704 --> 01:21:01,531
Business...

1048
01:21:03,249 --> 01:21:06,452
- Business: prostitution.
- On my property?

1049
01:21:06,586 --> 01:21:10,536
- Well, I'll have them evicted.
- Of course. Of course.

1050
01:21:10,673 --> 01:21:13,046
You've been victimised, George.

1051
01:21:13,176 --> 01:21:15,548
- Same as me.
- Yeah.

1052
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:22,268
Evening, boys. Never bet into an open
pair... unless you've got the lock!

1053
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:25,885
- Say good night, George.
- Oh, this?

1054
01:21:26,022 --> 01:21:30,601
Well, we're just playing for chips -
you know, sociable.

1055
01:21:30,735 --> 01:21:35,064
- You takin' me for a ride or somethin'?
- To the publisher of the Times-DisPatch

1056
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:37,950
- You got somethin' on him, too?
- I got you.

1057
01:21:38,076 --> 01:21:40,946
- Yeah, sure, but...
- It's getting late, George.

1058
01:21:41,079 --> 01:21:44,364
The point is, why did he write this trash,
and why did you publish it?

1059
01:21:44,499 --> 01:21:47,453
- Are you suggesting censorship, Miss?
- Only fair play.

1060
01:21:47,585 --> 01:21:49,792
- This is muckraking!
- Is it true?

1061
01:21:49,921 --> 01:21:51,712
- No!
- Then sue us for libel.

1062
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:56,133
Oh, you're much too clever for that.
It's what you imply - the veiled slurs.

1063
01:21:56,261 --> 01:21:59,546
- Hints that I misused collection money.
- I never said that.

1064
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:03,678
Did I ever preach anything
but God's word? Well? Did I?

1065
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:05,968
- Are you ordained?
- What?

1066
01:22:06,104 --> 01:22:09,971
Do you hold a degree from any
recognised theological seminary?

1067
01:22:10,108 --> 01:22:13,025
- Does Gantry?
- No.

1068
01:22:13,153 --> 01:22:16,356
Are you sanctioned
to preach by any church?

1069
01:22:16,489 --> 01:22:21,447
No, Mr Lefferts, but... neither was Peter
or Paul or any of the other apostles.

1070
01:22:21,578 --> 01:22:25,243
Ah, but they said that they lived with
the Son of God, were taught by him,

1071
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:27,781
were sanctified by him.

1072
01:22:27,917 --> 01:22:31,417
What gives you
the right to speak for God?

1073
01:22:35,842 --> 01:22:39,341
I couldn't possibly be doing
God's work without his approval.

1074
01:22:39,471 --> 01:22:41,843
How did you get his approval?

1075
01:22:43,975 --> 01:22:46,596
Did God speak to you personally?

1076
01:22:48,813 --> 01:22:51,185
Did he send you a letter?

1077
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:54,724
Did you have a visitation from God?

1078
01:22:54,861 --> 01:22:57,103
A burning bush, perhaps?

1079
01:22:59,157 --> 01:23:04,317
Where in the New Testament does it say
that God spoke to anyone except his son?

1080
01:23:07,207 --> 01:23:09,876
But it does say in the First Corinthians

1081
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:13,417
"Let your women
keep silence in the churches."

1082
01:23:13,546 --> 01:23:16,381
"It is a shame for women
to speak in the church."

1083
01:23:16,508 --> 01:23:20,552
Congratulations, Jim boy. I see you're
a student of the Bible. I'm delighted.

1084
01:23:20,678 --> 01:23:25,139
What is it? Are you responsible for some
of these crackpot calls I've been getting?

1085
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:28,470
- You want Mr Lefferts fired, too?
- Fired?

1086
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:31,604
Why, I'd give Jim a bonus
for boostin' circulation.

1087
01:23:31,731 --> 01:23:34,103
I thought you came to bury Caesar,
not to praise him.

1088
01:23:34,234 --> 01:23:39,228
Shakespeare. Ah, yes. A moment ago you
used the Bible... to whip Sister Sharon.

1089
01:23:39,364 --> 01:23:43,231
- I merely quoted it as a source.
- Of course. As a good newspaperman,

1090
01:23:43,368 --> 01:23:46,701
you wouldn't use information
unless it was fact, would you?

1091
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:49,581
Tell me somethin', Jim.

1092
01:23:49,707 --> 01:23:51,700
Is the Bible fact?

1093
01:23:51,835 --> 01:23:53,115
Hm?

1094
01:23:53,253 --> 01:23:56,787
Well, come on, Jim boy.
Did God create the universe in six days?

1095
01:23:56,923 --> 01:24:00,374
Did He make the sun stand still
to help Joshua lick the Amalekites?

1096
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:02,052
No.

1097
01:24:02,178 --> 01:24:04,467
- You don't believe Moses parted the sea?
- No.

1098
01:24:04,597 --> 01:24:07,883
- God wrote the Ten Commandments?
- Nope.

1099
01:24:08,017 --> 01:24:10,769
Or that the dead were raised
and the blind cured?

1100
01:24:10,895 --> 01:24:14,430
And 5,000 people were fed
with five little fishes

1101
01:24:14,566 --> 01:24:16,891
and two little itty-bitty loaves of bread?

1102
01:24:17,026 --> 01:24:18,106
No.

1103
01:24:18,236 --> 01:24:21,652
You don't believe in any of the miracles
in the Holy Bible, do you?

1104
01:24:21,781 --> 01:24:26,692
No more than I believe that black cats or
spilt salt or broken mirrors are bad luck.

1105
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:31,324
Or that God can be jealous
or bloodthirsty or vengeful.

1106
01:24:31,457 --> 01:24:35,586
Or that Jehovah sanctions bigamy
and stupidity and slavery.

1107
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:38,962
In other words,
you don't believe in the Bible.

1108
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:44,042
I believe that the Bible is a book
of beautiful poetry and wisdom...

1109
01:24:44,179 --> 01:24:46,218
But it's not fact.

1110
01:24:49,517 --> 01:24:50,762
And if it's not fact,

1111
01:24:50,894 --> 01:24:54,512
why would he use it as information,
except to destroy her character?

1112
01:24:54,647 --> 01:24:58,147
I heard you say it,
and you'll burn in hell for it.

1113
01:24:58,276 --> 01:25:01,562
No, Georgie.
You can't scare Jim that way.

1114
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:08,617
You see, if you don't believe in the Bible...
you don't believe there's a real hell.

1115
01:25:08,745 --> 01:25:09,943
Hey.

1116
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:14,208
And it follows if there's no real hell, there
can't be a real heaven. Right, Jim boy?

1117
01:25:14,334 --> 01:25:17,370
Why don't you get to the point?

1118
01:25:17,504 --> 01:25:21,632
Do you believe Jesus Christ
can give us life everlasting?

1119
01:25:29,641 --> 01:25:33,769
Do you believe Jesus Christ
can give us life everlasting?

1120
01:25:36,272 --> 01:25:39,059
- I'd love to believe it.
- But you don't?

1121
01:25:40,109 --> 01:25:41,734
No.

1122
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:49,441
Then you don't accept
Jesus Christ as divine, do you?

1123
01:26:00,505 --> 01:26:01,501
Well?

1124
01:26:04,843 --> 01:26:10,347
Jesus was a great, virtuous teacher.
His faith and courage changed the world.

1125
01:26:10,473 --> 01:26:13,510
Do you accept Jesus Christ as divine?

1126
01:26:17,647 --> 01:26:21,063
Let me say... I have doubts.

1127
01:26:21,192 --> 01:26:25,404
- That's blasphemy!
- Mr Babbitt, to doubt is not blasphemy.

1128
01:26:25,530 --> 01:26:29,362
When you say "blasphemy", you mean
"Don't dare disagree. Don't think."

1129
01:26:29,492 --> 01:26:31,651
"Don't doubt."

1130
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:37,243
But Tolstoy, Darwin, Jefferson, Lincoln -
they had the same doubts.

1131
01:26:37,375 --> 01:26:40,044
Then they'll burn in hell, too!

1132
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:44,794
Mr Eddington, in spite of
Mr Lefferts' confessed bigotry,

1133
01:26:44,924 --> 01:26:48,589
I defend your right to publish these
articles. But give us equal rights.

1134
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:52,848
- Your reply'll be published prominently.
- Mr Eddington, I'm no writer.

1135
01:26:52,974 --> 01:26:56,224
Now, Jim is brilliant and witty.
Uses words like a stiletto.

1136
01:26:56,352 --> 01:26:59,971
He learned from Mencken, Ingersoll,
Sinclair Lewis, other atheists.

1137
01:27:00,106 --> 01:27:02,348
- Atheists!
- But you own a radio station.

1138
01:27:02,484 --> 01:27:05,438
Set the time. Half an hour.
Tonight? Tomorrow? Name it.

1139
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:09,188
Every day for two weeks -
half-hour in the morning and evening.

1140
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:14,033
- Just to answer this article?
- I don't intend to answer anything.

1141
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:16,201
You don't debate the existence of God.

1142
01:27:16,331 --> 01:27:19,747
Jim, here, has spread
the poison of doubt and disbelief.

1143
01:27:19,876 --> 01:27:24,668
Just give me a chance to spread the
gospel, to raise the banner of Christianity,

1144
01:27:24,797 --> 01:27:27,668
to restore the faith he stole.

1145
01:27:27,801 --> 01:27:31,419
Now, sir, I realise time means money -
especially radio time.

1146
01:27:31,554 --> 01:27:33,428
Right.

1147
01:27:34,224 --> 01:27:36,465
So our good citizen, George F Babbitt,

1148
01:27:36,601 --> 01:27:41,596
has kindly consented to pay for every
minute of radio time. Right, George?

1149
01:27:41,731 --> 01:27:43,771
Georgie boy?

1150
01:27:46,444 --> 01:27:49,611
- Right.
- Thank you, sir. Good night.

1151
01:27:49,739 --> 01:27:51,364
Sister.

1152
01:27:52,492 --> 01:27:55,409
Good night, Mr Eddington. Mr Lefferts.

1153
01:27:55,537 --> 01:27:58,787
- Jim boy.
- Congratulations.

1154
01:27:58,915 --> 01:28:01,323
I bear you no malice. Mr Babbitt.

1155
01:28:01,751 --> 01:28:05,452
Blasphemy! Good night, Mr Eddington.

1156
01:28:05,588 --> 01:28:09,253
And you... you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

1157
01:28:23,523 --> 01:28:26,643
Oh, it was... glorious.

1158
01:28:26,776 --> 01:28:30,026
Outrageously, blissfully glorious.

1159
01:28:31,114 --> 01:28:36,820
Oh, you really are an alley fighter.
You hit Brother Jim both sides of the belt!

1160
01:28:36,953 --> 01:28:40,120
You murdered 'em. You knocked
'em flat with a celestial bolt -

1161
01:28:40,248 --> 01:28:43,119
eight, nine, ten, and out! Oh, darling!

1162
01:28:49,507 --> 01:28:55,012
You didn't fight fair but you've seen
your duty and you've done it. Oh, darling!

1163
01:29:00,977 --> 01:29:04,975
Stop it. Stop it. I was crazy.
I was so happy you delivered me!

1164
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:10,267
Can't you understand? God sent you
to me as his instrument, not as my lover.

1165
01:29:12,614 --> 01:29:18,035
No, I don't understand. You got me
half-crazy, talkin' to myself.

1166
01:29:18,161 --> 01:29:21,577
One minute you're a howling banshee,
the next, you're cold potatoes.

1167
01:29:21,706 --> 01:29:24,411
I don't understand anything,
but I worship you.

1168
01:29:25,502 --> 01:29:29,369
Well, then, stop treating me
like one of your tramps!

1169
01:29:29,506 --> 01:29:32,921
There's no such thing. There's
honest women and dishonest women.

1170
01:29:33,051 --> 01:29:35,542
And you want to make
an honest woman out of me. Men!

1171
01:29:35,678 --> 01:29:38,596
Don't knock 'em if you haven't tried 'em.

1172
01:29:38,723 --> 01:29:41,179
- EncycloPaedia sexualis
- I never read it.

1173
01:29:41,309 --> 01:29:45,556
You wrote it! You've just got to have
every woman - old, young, stupid. Even...

1174
01:29:46,523 --> 01:29:50,355
Even poor, starved Rachel
with her wet calf eyes.

1175
01:29:51,653 --> 01:29:54,856
- May God strike me dead...
- Be careful, or he'll strike you dead

1176
01:29:54,989 --> 01:29:59,698
for being the ungrateful liar that you are.
Can't you ever tell the truth?

1177
01:29:59,828 --> 01:30:04,904
You wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.
It's you I want, Shara. No one else.

1178
01:30:05,041 --> 01:30:07,959
I want you so bad,
I'm in pain half the time.

1179
01:30:08,086 --> 01:30:10,837
I'd tear your holy wings off,
make a woman out of you.

1180
01:30:10,964 --> 01:30:15,839
I'd show you what heaven is - no golden
stairways or harp music or silvery clouds.

1181
01:30:15,969 --> 01:30:18,756
Just ecstasy, comin' and goin'.

1182
01:30:20,223 --> 01:30:23,010
Do you really think I'd compete
for your glorious body?

1183
01:30:23,143 --> 01:30:27,851
Damn right. Every woman competes
with every other woman for every man.

1184
01:30:29,816 --> 01:30:34,359
It's the truth, Shara. You want it.
You want it as much as I do.

1185
01:30:34,487 --> 01:30:39,030
You want it with me. When are you
going to make up your mind to take it?

1186
01:30:47,167 --> 01:30:49,836
Get in the car. Go on, do as I say.

1187
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,190
Turn on the lights, please.

1188
01:31:29,918 --> 01:31:31,542
There.

1189
01:31:33,046 --> 01:31:35,963
That's what I've been working for.

1190
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:40,135
No more tents. No more
running around like a circus.

1191
01:31:40,261 --> 01:31:42,883
No more haggling with committees.

1192
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:45,970
My own tabernacle.

1193
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:52,054
A permanent home. A clinic for
sick bodies. A free soup kitchen.

1194
01:31:52,190 --> 01:31:56,022
A place of worship for
everybody of every faith.

1195
01:31:57,445 --> 01:31:59,438
That's my first love.

1196
01:32:04,661 --> 01:32:07,199
What have you got to match that?

1197
01:32:08,790 --> 01:32:11,328
Nothin'. Nothin' at all.

1198
01:32:12,293 --> 01:32:15,745
I'm just a hick from Kansas,
and you're real class, Shara.

1199
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:20,127
The only class I've got is the name
Falconer. That's why I picked it.

1200
01:32:21,261 --> 01:32:24,215
I'm Katie Jones from shantytown.

1201
01:32:26,516 --> 01:32:29,683
That's right. Shantytown.

1202
01:32:29,811 --> 01:32:35,232
But does that make a liar out of me?
I am Sharon Falconer now. I've made her.

1203
01:32:35,358 --> 01:32:39,605
I've put her together piece by piece
till I've got a right to be her. I am her.

1204
01:32:40,155 --> 01:32:43,440
I started building this tabernacle
two years ago,

1205
01:32:43,575 --> 01:32:47,407
and when this revival is ended,
I'll have enough money to own it.

1206
01:32:47,787 --> 01:32:51,701
Do you think it was blind luck
that brought us to Zenith?

1207
01:32:56,087 --> 01:32:58,127
Do you?

1208
01:32:59,924 --> 01:33:02,083
Of course not.

1209
01:33:02,218 --> 01:33:05,468
- It was God's will.
- Of course.

1210
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:18,224
- Now do you understand why we...?
- Of course. Of course.

1211
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:20,933
- Nothing's going to take it away from me.
- Nothing.

1212
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:23,312
- Nobody must spoil it.
- Nobody.

1213
01:33:24,574 --> 01:33:27,030
- I've never...
- Of course.

1214
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:29,199
- Never.
- Naturally.

1215
01:33:30,288 --> 01:33:32,328
Yes.

1216
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:37,167
(man) Sister Sharon?

1217
01:33:37,962 --> 01:33:39,160
Sister Sharon?

1218
01:33:48,306 --> 01:33:51,722
Jim Lefferts is an honourable man.
But so was Brutus.

1219
01:33:51,851 --> 01:33:56,264
And we all know that Brutus was
an anarchistic, alcoholic assassin.

1220
01:33:59,442 --> 01:34:05,563
Jim "Lucifer" Lefferts calls you good
PeoPle of Zenith suckers, slickers, saPs

1221
01:34:05,698 --> 01:34:11,073
He attacks the way you worshiP I don't
notice him attackin' booze or Prostitution

1222
01:34:12,789 --> 01:34:15,280
Lucifer Jim says he wants to save you

1223
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:18,832
How? By stabbin' Jesus with dirty lies?

1224
01:34:19,879 --> 01:34:21,955
By assassinatin' God?

1225
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:26,378
I have here in my pocket -

1226
01:34:26,511 --> 01:34:28,918
and thank heaven you can't see them -

1227
01:34:29,055 --> 01:34:31,842
lewd, dirty, obscene...

1228
01:34:32,934 --> 01:34:34,428
And I'm ashamed to say this.

1229
01:34:34,561 --> 01:34:36,600
..French postcards.

1230
01:34:39,107 --> 01:34:43,187
They were sold to me, in front of
your own innocent high school,

1231
01:34:43,319 --> 01:34:47,317
by a man with a black beard. A foreigner!

1232
01:34:47,448 --> 01:34:49,774
- Shocking!
- And last night...

1233
01:34:49,909 --> 01:34:56,528
last night, right here on Main Street,
I was accosted by three painted women!

1234
01:34:56,666 --> 01:34:59,584
- The tramps.
- Your streets are made unsafe

1235
01:34:59,711 --> 01:35:02,118
by shameless, diseased hussies,

1236
01:35:02,255 --> 01:35:07,166
raPacious PickPockets,
and insidious oPium-smokers

1237
01:35:07,302 --> 01:35:09,508
And Elmer Gantry.

1238
01:35:11,431 --> 01:35:13,222
(bell rings)

1239
01:35:13,349 --> 01:35:18,307
This newspaper... this newspaper
says everybody's against me.

1240
01:35:18,438 --> 01:35:22,899
The mildewed Methodists, Episcopalians,
and Baptists are against me.

1241
01:35:23,026 --> 01:35:25,599
Even the ossified, petrified, horizontal,

1242
01:35:25,737 --> 01:35:28,572
perpendicular Presbyterians
are against me!

1243
01:35:28,698 --> 01:35:31,106
But this newspaper lies!

1244
01:35:31,242 --> 01:35:33,650
Some of the preachers
might be against me.

1245
01:35:33,995 --> 01:35:38,324
Unitarianism, Russellism,
Spiritualism - they hate me!

1246
01:35:38,458 --> 01:35:41,459
And what hates me
most of all is Harvardism,

1247
01:35:41,586 --> 01:35:44,457
Yaleism, and Princetonism!

1248
01:35:45,465 --> 01:35:48,549
But you're some of God's best people.

1249
01:35:48,676 --> 01:35:51,381
- And you don't hate me, do you?
- No!

1250
01:35:51,513 --> 01:35:55,012
- Smack 'em down, preacher!
- Kill 'em! Murder 'em!

1251
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:03,222
Can you hear me, Jesus?

1252
01:36:05,276 --> 01:36:10,187
I'd like you to save this
old friend of mine, Jim Lefferts,

1253
01:36:10,323 --> 01:36:15,365
who's been writin' all these dirty, black
lies about me. But I'll warn you, Jesus.

1254
01:36:15,495 --> 01:36:19,195
You better wear rubber gloves
and use a strong disinfectant.

1255
01:36:19,332 --> 01:36:23,033
But if you can save sinner Jim...
I'd like for you to do it.

1256
01:36:24,128 --> 01:36:26,798
What the hell's he trying to do?

1257
01:36:28,842 --> 01:36:30,881
(bell rings)

1258
01:36:34,097 --> 01:36:37,466
Shara, they've played
your introduction twice now.

1259
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:40,056
This is the biggest crowd we've ever had.

1260
01:36:43,314 --> 01:36:45,852
Please, Shara.

1261
01:36:45,984 --> 01:36:50,562
? Glory, glory, hallelujah

1262
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:55,526
? Glory, glory, hallelujah

1263
01:36:58,163 --> 01:37:02,291
(Gantry) We're all sinners,
every blessed one of us

1264
01:37:08,715 --> 01:37:13,009
Booze! Booze put a bullet
through Lincoln and McKinley!

1265
01:37:14,762 --> 01:37:21,476
Booze is the way white slavers rob the
virtue of 60,000 American girls every year!

1266
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:27,976
The bootleggers, the white slavers,

1267
01:37:28,109 --> 01:37:31,561
and that newspaper are tryin'
to scare me and Sister outta town!

1268
01:37:31,696 --> 01:37:33,772
(crowd boos)

1269
01:37:34,699 --> 01:37:37,486
But as long as I got a foot, I'll kick booze!

1270
01:37:37,619 --> 01:37:40,370
As long as I got a fist, I'll punch it!

1271
01:37:40,497 --> 01:37:43,533
And as long as I've got a tooth, I'll bite it!

1272
01:37:43,666 --> 01:37:47,249
And when I'm old and grey
and toothless and bootless,

1273
01:37:47,378 --> 01:37:52,717
I'll gum it, till I go to heaven,
and booze goes to hell!

1274
01:37:57,514 --> 01:38:00,135
That's a hell of a speech.

1275
01:38:00,266 --> 01:38:04,845
It's been eight days. It's been eight days
since I gave you the addresses

1276
01:38:04,979 --> 01:38:08,847
of 11 blind tigers, two cocaine peddlers,

1277
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:11,653
and 16 brothels.

1278
01:38:11,778 --> 01:38:13,569
And what's been done about it?

1279
01:38:13,696 --> 01:38:16,152
- Nothing, Captain.
- (cheering)

1280
01:38:18,535 --> 01:38:21,986
We're gettin' sick and tired of scoldin' sin.

1281
01:38:22,121 --> 01:38:24,410
We're gonna abolish it!

1282
01:38:24,541 --> 01:38:28,075
We'll show 'em how to clean up
this town tonight! Right now!

1283
01:38:28,211 --> 01:38:30,204
Charge!

1284
01:38:34,008 --> 01:38:35,800
Elmer, be careful.

1285
01:38:35,927 --> 01:38:37,718
Courage, Sister. Courage.

1286
01:38:38,888 --> 01:38:41,973
(crowd sings
"Onward Christian Soldiers")

1287
01:38:51,609 --> 01:38:55,773
Brother Jim! Glad to see you
on the side of the angels.

1288
01:38:55,905 --> 01:39:00,069
Aren't you afraid some of these
desperate bootleggers carry guns?

1289
01:39:00,201 --> 01:39:04,413
- No bullet could pierce the Holy Bible.
- They might not aim at the Holy Bible.

1290
01:39:04,539 --> 01:39:06,781
Very good! Onward!

1291
01:39:24,976 --> 01:39:28,760
- Smash that speakeasy door!
- What for? Just knock. They'll open up.

1292
01:39:28,897 --> 01:39:31,103
Captain. My good man.

1293
01:39:32,567 --> 01:39:35,023
Hold it! All right, Reverend.

1294
01:39:42,202 --> 01:39:44,075
(women scream)

1295
01:39:44,204 --> 01:39:47,655
- Sinful woman!
- That's a dirty lie! We pay protection!

1296
01:39:47,790 --> 01:39:50,246
- Shame! Shame!
- Take 'em away, men!

1297
01:39:50,376 --> 01:39:53,580
- Whisky!
- Why didn't you give me a phone call?

1298
01:39:53,713 --> 01:39:56,204
Don't break the furniture!

1299
01:40:01,095 --> 01:40:06,256
- Should've seen what this one was doing.
- Harlot! You ought to be asha...

1300
01:40:09,103 --> 01:40:11,345
Arrest this woman!

1301
01:40:18,822 --> 01:40:23,033
? ..soldiers, marching as to war

1302
01:40:25,286 --> 01:40:29,664
Captain Holt, may I suggest you release
these poor unfortunate creatures?

1303
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:31,700
- What? But you told me...
- I know.

1304
01:40:31,835 --> 01:40:34,871
But throwing a prostitute into jail
will not remove her sin.

1305
01:40:35,004 --> 01:40:39,713
And it certainly won't get rid of
prostitution. No pictures. No publicity.

1306
01:40:39,843 --> 01:40:44,220
Captain Holt, I want to compliment
you and your men on a fine, patriotic job.

1307
01:40:44,347 --> 01:40:46,838
Why, thank you, sir.

1308
01:40:46,975 --> 01:40:49,382
See these girls leave town. And quick.

1309
01:40:49,519 --> 01:40:51,642
(aPPlause)

1310
01:40:57,777 --> 01:41:00,019
Excuse me, Mr Gantry.

1311
01:41:01,906 --> 01:41:05,109
That Mr Gantry,
he's absolutely incredible.

1312
01:41:05,243 --> 01:41:08,944
The fabulous thing about Mr Gantry
is, he's absolutely credible.

1313
01:41:11,082 --> 01:41:14,581
- (man) Excuse me, please.
- She's here, Mr Gantry.

1314
01:41:16,045 --> 01:41:19,497
- (man) Oh, Mr Gantry...
- Not now. Not now. Later. Later.

1315
01:41:19,632 --> 01:41:23,630
There you are. Sister'll see all of you
as soon as she's had a moment's rest.

1316
01:41:26,598 --> 01:41:30,132
Mayor, congressman, the governor,
and lookie here, Shara.

1317
01:41:30,268 --> 01:41:34,218
Offers... from England, Japan,
Australia, Madison Square Garden...

1318
01:41:34,355 --> 01:41:36,728
- From me to you.
- ..the circus.

1319
01:41:37,901 --> 01:41:40,308
Shara, you shouldn't have.

1320
01:41:40,445 --> 01:41:44,277
How about you sneaking away
with Katie Jones on a real fun picnic?

1321
01:41:44,407 --> 01:41:47,112
No telegrams,
no newspapers, no sermons.

1322
01:41:47,243 --> 01:41:50,244
The only business of the day will be us.
Just the two of us.

1323
01:41:50,371 --> 01:41:51,996
Oh, Shara.

1324
01:41:53,082 --> 01:41:55,704
- We can't.
- But why? I've got the escape planned.

1325
01:41:55,835 --> 01:42:00,544
The car's out front. We'll disappear
before they even know we've gone.

1326
01:42:00,673 --> 01:42:03,877
You're gonna cinch a contribution
from the ladies' committee.

1327
01:42:04,010 --> 01:42:07,461
At 11 o'clock, we dedicate your
Waters of the Jordan Tabernacle -

1328
01:42:07,597 --> 01:42:10,432
the mayor, fireworks,
the brass band, everything.

1329
01:42:10,558 --> 01:42:14,770
12.30, lunch, Rosen's department store,
where you say grace for 200 salesmen.

1330
01:42:14,896 --> 01:42:19,225
- And at two o'clock...
- I'll be exhausted, irritable and hateful.

1331
01:42:20,151 --> 01:42:23,354
Shara... we'll celebrate tonight.

1332
01:42:23,696 --> 01:42:26,022
- Late.
- Tonight's a thousand years away.

1333
01:42:26,157 --> 01:42:28,197
Shara, baby...

1334
01:42:29,369 --> 01:42:35,324
Oh, very well. Bring in those smug
little ladies with their fat little hands,

1335
01:42:35,458 --> 01:42:41,045
- fat little souls and fat little...
- Don't forget their fat little chequebooks.

1336
01:42:44,467 --> 01:42:48,168
- Ladies. Dear ladies.
- Mr Gantry? You're wanted on the phone.

1337
01:42:48,304 --> 01:42:53,013
Thank you. Bill. I'll take it right here.
Lovely morning, isn't it?

1338
01:42:53,143 --> 01:42:55,468
- Hello?
- Mr Gantry, it's so nice meeting you.

1339
01:42:55,603 --> 01:42:58,640
- Sister joyously awaits you.
- Oh, Mr Gantry.

1340
01:42:58,773 --> 01:43:03,565
Thank you very much. Hello? Yes,
this is Dr Gantry - uh, Mr Gantry. Who?

1341
01:43:03,903 --> 01:43:07,106
Elmer, honey? It's Lulu.

1342
01:43:08,616 --> 01:43:10,858
- Who?
- I just called to say thanks

1343
01:43:10,994 --> 01:43:13,864
for gettin' me out of that jam last night.

1344
01:43:19,878 --> 01:43:22,629
What's the address?

1345
01:43:22,755 --> 01:43:26,919
Mr Gantry, I just had to congratulate you.
You were marvellous last night.

1346
01:43:27,051 --> 01:43:29,721
Last night? Oh. Yes.

1347
01:43:35,518 --> 01:43:37,890
- Get hold of Benny.
- Now, wait a minute.

1348
01:43:38,021 --> 01:43:41,520
- This Gantry bum's a preacher.
- Get hold of Benny.

1349
01:43:46,988 --> 01:43:48,613
OK.

1350
01:44:02,837 --> 01:44:05,209
Are these pictures for
divorce or blackmail?

1351
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:08,257
- Benny, come on!
- Remember, position is everything.

1352
01:44:08,384 --> 01:44:09,464
No!

1353
01:44:09,594 --> 01:44:14,090
Without any flash powder, you gotta get
this guy to freeze for a couple of seconds.

1354
01:44:14,224 --> 01:44:18,720
Time exposure takes time.
So keep him still... and quiet.

1355
01:44:18,853 --> 01:44:21,771
- But that's so dull!
- And keep the radio playin'.

1356
01:44:21,898 --> 01:44:24,899
- So he don't hear this.
- (camera clicks)

1357
01:44:25,026 --> 01:44:26,271
- OK?
- OK.

1358
01:44:26,402 --> 01:44:28,027
OK, OK. Let's go!

1359
01:44:32,242 --> 01:44:36,026
Hey, chick. This preacher fella.
You think you could get him into bed?

1360
01:44:36,162 --> 01:44:38,321
- Are you kiddin'?
- (knocking at door)

1361
01:44:38,456 --> 01:44:40,532
Hey, Benny. Come on!

1362
01:44:45,463 --> 01:44:47,088
(knocking)

1363
01:44:48,925 --> 01:44:50,549
(knocking)

1364
01:44:53,888 --> 01:44:55,513
(knocking)

1365
01:45:14,367 --> 01:45:16,739
- You look swell, kid.
- Likewise.

1366
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:18,909
Just swell.

1367
01:45:28,423 --> 01:45:31,092
- Sorry about last night.
- Forget it.

1368
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:39,678
- If I'd known I'd run into you, I'd have...
- Oh, that's OK.

1369
01:45:51,362 --> 01:45:53,853
- What the hell's the big idea?
- Elmer, honey...

1370
01:45:53,990 --> 01:45:58,237
- You think I'll sit still for a shakedown?
- How could I put the squeeze on you?

1371
01:45:58,369 --> 01:46:02,450
- Who'll take the word of a hooker?
- The old badger game, huh?

1372
01:46:02,582 --> 01:46:05,583
- I only wanted to see you for...
- For what?

1373
01:46:05,710 --> 01:46:07,952
- Well, for...
- For what?

1374
01:46:09,088 --> 01:46:14,712
Gee, honey, look. Look, I'm almost
packed. The cops gave me notice.

1375
01:46:14,844 --> 01:46:17,514
I got a ticket on the midnight bus.

1376
01:46:30,819 --> 01:46:33,060
I got no beef against you.

1377
01:46:34,197 --> 01:46:37,151
I only wanted to see you once more,

1378
01:46:37,283 --> 01:46:41,411
kick around some old memories,
maybe have a few laughs.

1379
01:46:41,538 --> 01:46:43,577
Go on.

1380
01:46:48,503 --> 01:46:50,709
Who am I kiddin'?

1381
01:46:52,131 --> 01:46:56,628
When you first hit town, I figured
you could go to hell without my help.

1382
01:46:56,761 --> 01:47:00,629
When you came bustin' in last night
like God Almighty wearin' a tin star,

1383
01:47:00,765 --> 01:47:05,926
I got mad, boilin' mad. All I could think of
was how you took me and ditched me.

1384
01:47:06,062 --> 01:47:09,811
That's all I could think of.
Me, little Miss Lulu, the dumb pushover.

1385
01:47:09,941 --> 01:47:12,693
And when the cops said
"Get out of town in 24 hours",

1386
01:47:12,819 --> 01:47:15,144
all I wanted to do was spit in your eye,

1387
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:18,814
blackmail you, a shakedown -
anything to hurt you.

1388
01:47:21,369 --> 01:47:22,994
But...

1389
01:47:24,622 --> 01:47:27,292
But when you walked in just now...

1390
01:47:29,544 --> 01:47:31,999
Gee, honey...

1391
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:35,629
it was like the first time
between us all over again.

1392
01:47:37,218 --> 01:47:39,674
All goose pimples and...

1393
01:47:44,350 --> 01:47:46,473
You'd better beat it.

1394
01:47:48,521 --> 01:47:50,763
I'm sorry I phoned.

1395
01:47:51,774 --> 01:47:54,941
I won't make any trouble.
Not even if I could.

1396
01:47:58,490 --> 01:48:00,731
Please go now.

1397
01:48:04,871 --> 01:48:08,287
I did run out on you
back there in Kansas, didn't I?

1398
01:48:09,584 --> 01:48:13,285
It's nobody's fault.
Except maybe my old man's.

1399
01:48:13,421 --> 01:48:16,173
- Ever hear from him?
- Once, last Christmas.

1400
01:48:16,299 --> 01:48:21,638
The letter said "Daughter, read
1st Kings, Chapter 21, Verse 23."

1401
01:48:21,763 --> 01:48:27,006
I looked it up. It said "And the dogs
in the street shall eat Jezebel."

1402
01:48:28,853 --> 01:48:31,225
My old man and his Bible.

1403
01:48:32,857 --> 01:48:34,897
Tell me...

1404
01:48:35,735 --> 01:48:39,151
how is it some people can
only find hate in the Bible?

1405
01:48:43,660 --> 01:48:48,369
- Where will you be going to?
- I think I'll go tramping through Paris.

1406
01:48:48,498 --> 01:48:51,582
Can you use some cash?
Sort of tide you over?

1407
01:48:56,714 --> 01:48:59,466
Just... just kiss me goodbye.

1408
01:49:00,802 --> 01:49:02,676
Just once.

1409
01:49:46,222 --> 01:49:48,262
What's she doin'?

1410
01:49:58,443 --> 01:50:00,482
Stay awhile.

1411
01:50:02,655 --> 01:50:04,695
Talk to me.

1412
01:50:06,034 --> 01:50:08,821
Oh, don't go yet. Please don't go.

1413
01:50:11,581 --> 01:50:13,787
Tell me anything.

1414
01:50:13,917 --> 01:50:17,499
Tell me a good, strong lie
I can believe, but hold me.

1415
01:50:17,629 --> 01:50:20,583
Just hold me like you used to.

1416
01:50:20,715 --> 01:50:22,340
Please.

1417
01:50:36,981 --> 01:50:39,270
- No use, Lu.
- Why?

1418
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:41,440
Because I...

1419
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:46,567
- I don't know. I...
- Because of what? Because of her?

1420
01:50:46,699 --> 01:50:48,359
That Bible broad?

1421
01:51:06,344 --> 01:51:08,882
I'm sorry. No hard feelings.

1422
01:51:10,014 --> 01:51:13,218
- Please. Don't go yet.
- Lu, I...

1423
01:51:13,351 --> 01:51:17,728
You know, I... I could use
some of that cash after all.

1424
01:51:18,690 --> 01:51:24,810
Why, sure. Maybe I could send you some
from time to time. Till you get a job, or...

1425
01:51:24,946 --> 01:51:28,196
or maybe meet some nice
respectable man, huh?

1426
01:51:28,324 --> 01:51:31,195
I meet nice respectable men every night.

1427
01:51:36,416 --> 01:51:38,788
The best bank in America.

1428
01:51:45,925 --> 01:51:48,796
- Take care of yourself.
- Likewise, hon.

1429
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:55,844
Class. She's got real class.

1430
01:52:11,659 --> 01:52:14,197
Wake up! Wake up, Miss Katie Jones!

1431
01:52:15,705 --> 01:52:20,747
You see before you the captain of the
SS HaPPiness, fishing boat extraordinary.

1432
01:52:20,877 --> 01:52:24,495
All aboard for a glorious,
carefree, happy cruise.

1433
01:52:24,631 --> 01:52:28,082
Fun, fish, frolic... and romance.

1434
01:52:28,802 --> 01:52:30,461
Guaranteed.

1435
01:52:36,226 --> 01:52:38,265
(knocking at door)

1436
01:52:39,729 --> 01:52:42,018
(knocking)

1437
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:44,682
(Persistent knocking)

1438
01:52:54,202 --> 01:52:59,956
Bill! Not one word, not one, about legal
documents, tents, moneys or lost souls.

1439
01:53:00,083 --> 01:53:03,618
We're going on a picnic, see,
and if you squeal, we'll rub you out.

1440
01:53:03,753 --> 01:53:05,995
Do you think I'd rat on a couple of pals?

1441
01:53:06,130 --> 01:53:08,503
It will be all right, won't it, for one day?

1442
01:53:08,633 --> 01:53:11,634
In that outfit, the fish'll jump
into the boat to look at you.

1443
01:53:11,761 --> 01:53:13,386
Yes.

1444
01:53:14,514 --> 01:53:17,468
We're going! We're going on a picnic!

1445
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:21,644
I've been promising
to take her on a picnic.

1446
01:53:23,189 --> 01:53:26,143
You got that look, Bill. What's the matter?

1447
01:53:37,787 --> 01:53:40,954
Elmer the Great. Elmer the Grifter.

1448
01:53:41,082 --> 01:53:45,543
The con man conned with
the oldest badger game in the world.

1449
01:53:45,670 --> 01:53:48,291
- I don't want Shara to see these.
- She'll have to.

1450
01:53:48,423 --> 01:53:52,634
Bill, I'll do anything you say.
I'll... I'll quit. I...

1451
01:53:53,386 --> 01:53:55,924
- Don't let Shara see these.
- She's got to see them.

1452
01:53:56,264 --> 01:54:00,890
Darling, don't you think we ought
to take Bill on the picnic with us?

1453
01:54:40,683 --> 01:54:42,308
I...

1454
01:54:45,104 --> 01:54:48,639
- I suppose they're for sale?
- $25,000.

1455
01:54:50,985 --> 01:54:53,108
25,000.

1456
01:54:53,530 --> 01:54:56,899
Two o'clock today. Cash. In small bills.

1457
01:54:57,033 --> 01:55:01,327
And she wants Shara
to bring her the money, nobody else.

1458
01:55:06,417 --> 01:55:08,659
Her name is Lulu Bains.

1459
01:55:20,098 --> 01:55:22,137
Get the money.

1460
01:55:25,562 --> 01:55:29,511
One more thing. She wants you to bring
the money to 721 Lombard Street.

1461
01:55:29,649 --> 01:55:32,852
That's where she worked
before it was raided.

1462
01:55:44,455 --> 01:55:47,540
(woman) Sammy! Get out of the water!

1463
01:55:55,550 --> 01:55:57,589
(? honky-tonk Piano)

1464
01:56:26,789 --> 01:56:28,782
(cat yowls)

1465
01:56:29,751 --> 01:56:32,289
Make yourself right at home, honey.

1466
01:56:52,982 --> 01:56:55,022
Be right there!

1467
01:56:55,318 --> 01:56:57,358
(cat meows)

1468
01:57:12,335 --> 01:57:14,375
(yowls)

1469
01:57:29,978 --> 01:57:32,220
I've brought the money.

1470
01:57:34,524 --> 01:57:36,766
May I have the negatives, please?

1471
01:57:52,333 --> 01:57:54,373
Extra, Jack!

1472
01:57:56,838 --> 01:58:01,666
Yeah. Yeah, I read the story,
I saw the pictures.

1473
01:58:01,801 --> 01:58:04,672
- Thank you very much.
- Did you see this?

1474
01:58:06,055 --> 01:58:08,095
I saw it.

1475
01:58:08,725 --> 01:58:11,263
- Did you see this?
- Yeah.

1476
01:58:11,394 --> 01:58:14,680
Now, I understand she brought
these pictures to you first.

1477
01:58:14,814 --> 01:58:16,688
- Yeah.
- And you turned her down?

1478
01:58:16,816 --> 01:58:18,441
Mm-hm.

1479
01:58:22,405 --> 01:58:24,030
Why?

1480
01:58:25,074 --> 01:58:29,368
These pictures prove only one thing -
that Gantry's as human as anybody else.

1481
01:58:29,496 --> 01:58:31,951
It's the obligation of a free press to print...

1482
01:58:32,081 --> 01:58:36,660
You're right, Mr Eddington. A free press
can print anything, including lies.

1483
01:58:36,794 --> 01:58:41,421
And that's exactly what
that pornography is: blackmailing lies.

1484
01:58:43,885 --> 01:58:45,924
(? "Abide With Me")

1485
01:58:57,315 --> 01:59:00,565
Why don't those men take off their hats?

1486
01:59:25,718 --> 01:59:28,554
First time I've seen
Reverend Pengilly up there.

1487
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:31,799
First time they've ever
been in trouble up there.

1488
01:59:37,063 --> 01:59:40,266
Thank you for coming here tonight.

1489
01:59:41,192 --> 01:59:44,526
You have every right to an explanation.

1490
01:59:45,196 --> 01:59:47,734
I will try to give it to you.

1491
01:59:48,074 --> 01:59:50,363
Tell us about sin, Sister!

1492
01:59:50,493 --> 01:59:53,743
(woman) Antichrist! You Judas, you!

1493
01:59:53,872 --> 01:59:56,078
- You false prophet!
- You faker, you!

1494
01:59:56,207 --> 01:59:58,200
- Boo!
- Yeah!

1495
01:59:58,334 --> 02:00:03,791
- Liar! Damn your own soul, Mr Gantry!
- You call yourself a preacher?

1496
02:00:08,219 --> 02:00:10,046
Come on, Rachel.

1497
02:00:15,935 --> 02:00:18,058
Rachel, you've gotta get outta here.

1498
02:00:18,354 --> 02:00:21,854
(trumPeter Plays jazz version
of "Onward Christian Soldiers")

1499
02:01:02,065 --> 02:01:04,437
Hey, Mr Gantry!

1500
02:01:38,434 --> 02:01:40,474
(Phones ringing)

1501
02:01:58,371 --> 02:02:00,992
- Hello?
- My name is Mrs Welmer

1502
02:02:01,124 --> 02:02:03,793
I go to church every Sunday

1503
02:02:05,253 --> 02:02:07,709
You tell that Sister Sharon

1504
02:02:20,310 --> 02:02:24,639
- Get outta town, preacher woman!
- Go home, Sister!

1505
02:02:24,772 --> 02:02:26,812
- Poor Sister!
- (laughter)

1506
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:37,525
O my God...

1507
02:02:39,078 --> 02:02:41,320
why hast thou forsaken me?

1508
02:02:46,252 --> 02:02:48,459
We'll take you home.

1509
02:03:20,745 --> 02:03:22,868
Why'd you do it?

1510
02:03:23,957 --> 02:03:26,163
Did... did she show with the money?

1511
02:03:27,252 --> 02:03:28,876
Well?

1512
02:03:30,213 --> 02:03:31,837
Yes.

1513
02:03:34,217 --> 02:03:37,384
Why didn't you go through with it? Why?

1514
02:03:39,806 --> 02:03:42,048
You wouldn't understand.

1515
02:03:50,150 --> 02:03:53,768
I know. You took
the pictures to the paper

1516
02:03:53,903 --> 02:03:56,655
cos they were gonna pay you more, huh?

1517
02:03:56,781 --> 02:03:58,857
How much did you get for 'em?

1518
02:03:58,992 --> 02:04:00,700
Nothing.

1519
02:04:00,827 --> 02:04:02,866
I didn't sell them.

1520
02:04:06,457 --> 02:04:09,127
You were never gonna sell 'em...

1521
02:04:09,252 --> 02:04:12,206
not even to that Sister woman, were you?

1522
02:04:12,338 --> 02:04:15,292
You hate Gantry that much?

1523
02:04:15,425 --> 02:04:18,046
Or do you love him that much?

1524
02:04:22,432 --> 02:04:25,053
And you're no good to me.

1525
02:04:25,185 --> 02:04:27,510
Or yourself.

1526
02:04:27,645 --> 02:04:30,101
You're no good to anybody!

1527
02:04:31,149 --> 02:04:32,643
(slaP)

1528
02:04:32,859 --> 02:04:33,772
(slaP)

1529
02:04:43,536 --> 02:04:46,206
Don't you know that hurts?

1530
02:06:05,869 --> 02:06:08,442
I'm sorry, Lu.

1531
02:06:08,580 --> 02:06:10,952
I'm sorry for everything.

1532
02:07:08,014 --> 02:07:10,256
Brothers and sisters...

1533
02:07:12,101 --> 02:07:13,560
goodbye.

1534
02:07:13,686 --> 02:07:14,766
Amen.

1535
02:07:17,106 --> 02:07:18,221
Jim boy!

1536
02:07:18,358 --> 02:07:21,359
You look like a man
who could use a drink.

1537
02:07:21,486 --> 02:07:27,240
Booze. You know somethin', Jim?
There oughta be a law against drinkin'.

1538
02:07:27,367 --> 02:07:30,652
- There is. Prohibition.
- That's against sellin', not drinkin'.

1539
02:07:30,787 --> 02:07:32,198
Amen.

1540
02:07:33,039 --> 02:07:35,577
- Happy days!
- I'll drink to that.

1541
02:07:37,502 --> 02:07:39,541
God, that's good.

1542
02:07:42,090 --> 02:07:44,497
Would you look at this place, Jim?

1543
02:07:47,220 --> 02:07:50,470
What were they so mad about, anyhow?

1544
02:07:50,598 --> 02:07:54,098
The mob don't like
their gods to be human.

1545
02:07:54,227 --> 02:07:57,560
- They hurt you?
- Not as much as you hurt me.

1546
02:07:57,689 --> 02:08:00,262
Nothing personal.

1547
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:03,151
What'll you do now?

1548
02:08:03,278 --> 02:08:07,489
Well, the way I got it figured, you're up,
you're down, you sin, you're saved.

1549
02:08:07,615 --> 02:08:11,115
You do the best you can,
and you leave the rest to the Lord.

1550
02:08:11,244 --> 02:08:13,949
You really do believe
in the Lord, don't you?

1551
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:18,872
Damn right I do. It does a man good
to get down on his knees once in a while.

1552
02:08:19,002 --> 02:08:21,409
That's why people
come to a place like this,

1553
02:08:21,546 --> 02:08:26,374
because they're scared, or sick,
or... because they got no money,

1554
02:08:26,509 --> 02:08:30,210
or too much money.
Or before a war, or after a war.

1555
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:36,268
Praying's the cheapest
first-rate medicine I know.

1556
02:08:36,394 --> 02:08:38,850
That's why Shara was so good for them.

1557
02:08:41,483 --> 02:08:43,724
She's a lotta woman.

1558
02:08:45,904 --> 02:08:47,528
Yeah.

1559
02:08:48,990 --> 02:08:51,315
You oughta marry her.

1560
02:08:51,451 --> 02:08:56,611
- You believe in holy matrimony?
- I can recommend it, never having tried it.

1561
02:08:57,707 --> 02:09:00,079
Too late now, Jim boy.

1562
02:09:01,085 --> 02:09:03,125
Maybe not.

1563
02:09:04,047 --> 02:09:08,044
Miss Bains was waiting for me
at the paper with that story.

1564
02:09:20,146 --> 02:09:23,064
- How'd you get her to do it?
- I didn't.

1565
02:09:25,568 --> 02:09:28,439
The Lord sure moves in mysterious ways.

1566
02:09:35,537 --> 02:09:40,080
Any minute now, you will hear
the voice of Sister Sharon Falconer,

1567
02:09:40,208 --> 02:09:42,616
but not that, I'm afraid, of Elmer Gantry.

1568
02:09:42,961 --> 02:09:46,495
For Mr Gantry has completely vanished
since three nights ago.

1569
02:09:46,631 --> 02:09:49,881
I've checked the police,
hospitals, railroads, bus depots...

1570
02:09:50,009 --> 02:09:51,552
Where is he? Where?

1571
02:09:51,678 --> 02:09:56,803
Every wire service in the country's asking
the same question. He's page-one news.

1572
02:09:56,933 --> 02:10:00,017
If anything happened to him,
you'd know it.

1573
02:10:04,482 --> 02:10:06,107
Yes.

1574
02:10:07,235 --> 02:10:09,477
Yes, I would know it.

1575
02:10:11,865 --> 02:10:15,993
He'll be here, I'm... I'm sure of it.
We'll wait for him.

1576
02:10:16,119 --> 02:10:21,623
We can't wait. Some of those people
have been out there since early morning.

1577
02:10:21,749 --> 02:10:25,249
- I won't go on without him.
- Maybe he won't be back.

1578
02:10:27,755 --> 02:10:29,795
Just a feeling.

1579
02:10:34,179 --> 02:10:36,136
We'll wait for him.

1580
02:10:41,769 --> 02:10:44,854
(congregation sings
"Onward Christian Soldiers")

1581
02:11:08,630 --> 02:11:10,254
Elmer?

1582
02:11:16,429 --> 02:11:18,173
Oh, darling!

1583
02:11:18,306 --> 02:11:20,049
Darling!

1584
02:11:21,893 --> 02:11:23,720
- Gantry's back.
- How do you know?

1585
02:11:23,853 --> 02:11:27,554
Somebody just saw him.
Where's a phone around here?

1586
02:11:28,233 --> 02:11:32,100
- What about your friend Gantry?
- Quite a guy! Son of a...

1587
02:11:32,237 --> 02:11:34,478
(band Plays fanfare)

1588
02:11:36,574 --> 02:11:38,863
Let me look at you.

1589
02:11:38,993 --> 02:11:41,994
Three endless days without a word.

1590
02:11:42,121 --> 02:11:43,865
Why?

1591
02:11:43,998 --> 02:11:47,533
Don't you realise how much I need you?

1592
02:11:50,338 --> 02:11:53,173
Are you angry? With me?

1593
02:11:53,299 --> 02:11:56,585
- No, Shara.
- Don't ever leave me again. Ever.

1594
02:11:58,304 --> 02:12:00,262
Shara.

1595
02:12:00,390 --> 02:12:02,014
Yes?

1596
02:12:03,268 --> 02:12:05,640
What would happen if we chucked it all,

1597
02:12:05,770 --> 02:12:09,934
beat it across the state line,
get good and married, like most folks?

1598
02:12:10,066 --> 02:12:14,395
Have a bunch of kids, take 'em
to a ball game like most folks.

1599
02:12:14,529 --> 02:12:19,570
Go dancin'. We've never gone
dancin' together, not even once.

1600
02:12:19,701 --> 02:12:22,156
Let's do it, Shara. Tonight. Right now.

1601
02:12:22,287 --> 02:12:25,786
- But all those people...
- If they wanna pray...

1602
02:12:26,666 --> 02:12:29,239
let 'em go to church.

1603
02:12:29,377 --> 02:12:31,002
But...

1604
02:12:32,505 --> 02:12:34,747
this is their church.

1605
02:12:37,302 --> 02:12:39,259
Look!

1606
02:12:39,387 --> 02:12:41,593
Look! A shooting star!

1607
02:12:42,807 --> 02:12:44,467
It's a sign,

1608
02:12:44,601 --> 02:12:48,135
an omen for the glory that begins tonight.

1609
02:12:49,647 --> 02:12:51,521
Ready, Shara.

1610
02:12:51,649 --> 02:12:56,146
(choir) ? Glory, glory, hallelujah

1611
02:12:56,362 --> 02:12:59,399
? Glory, glory, hallelujah

1612
02:12:59,532 --> 02:13:00,943
Wish me luck.

1613
02:13:01,075 --> 02:13:05,073
? Glory, glory, hallelujah

1614
02:13:05,205 --> 02:13:11,622
? His truth is marching on

1615
02:13:15,381 --> 02:13:18,382
If you believe in the faith
of your own Sister Sharon...

1616
02:13:18,510 --> 02:13:19,423
Yes!

1617
02:13:19,552 --> 02:13:22,174
..if you believe in
the innocence of Elmer Gantry...

1618
02:13:22,305 --> 02:13:23,503
Yes!

1619
02:13:23,640 --> 02:13:27,174
- ..and if you believe in God Almighty...
- Yes!

1620
02:13:27,310 --> 02:13:30,596
..reassure them with
a mighty "hallelujah"!

1621
02:13:30,730 --> 02:13:32,308
(loud cheering)

1622
02:13:51,292 --> 02:13:53,997
- Hallelujah, Sister!
- Hallelujah!

1623
02:14:12,438 --> 02:14:14,312
At this very moment,

1624
02:14:15,066 --> 02:14:19,360
the power of the Holy Ghost
has descended on this tabernacle.

1625
02:14:21,906 --> 02:14:23,946
He is here.

1626
02:14:24,868 --> 02:14:26,907
Here right now.

1627
02:14:27,203 --> 02:14:32,411
Just now, across the heavens,
towards the end of the world,

1628
02:14:32,917 --> 02:14:34,577
I saw an omen...

1629
02:14:35,086 --> 02:14:39,997
a fiery line written by the hand of God,
a glorious shooting star.

1630
02:14:40,967 --> 02:14:44,003
Thus, God has told us of his coming.

1631
02:14:44,721 --> 02:14:49,548
Have we lost God? Have we lost
contact with the supernatural?

1632
02:14:49,893 --> 02:14:54,186
Have we lost faith? Because
without faith, we are morally sick.

1633
02:14:54,522 --> 02:14:58,306
Faith... is the strongest force in the world.

1634
02:14:58,443 --> 02:15:00,566
Faith can raise the dead.

1635
02:15:00,695 --> 02:15:03,981
Faith can heal. Faith is the...

1636
02:15:04,115 --> 02:15:06,606
Help me, Sister! Help me!

1637
02:15:07,577 --> 02:15:09,616
Help me.

1638
02:15:10,705 --> 02:15:13,243
He can't hear, Sister. He's deaf.

1639
02:15:14,876 --> 02:15:17,449
Let him alone, please.

1640
02:15:28,890 --> 02:15:31,559
Help me, Sister.

1641
02:15:31,684 --> 02:15:34,092
Heal me.

1642
02:15:34,229 --> 02:15:36,305
(Morgan) You should take him to a doctor.

1643
02:15:36,439 --> 02:15:39,061
God is the greatest healer of all.

1644
02:15:39,776 --> 02:15:41,567
Was he born deaf?

1645
02:15:41,694 --> 02:15:45,395
A storm woke him up one night. He
screamed he couldn't hear the thunder.

1646
02:15:45,532 --> 02:15:48,532
- He could feel it but he couldn't hear it.
- You're his wife?

1647
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:51,744
Yes, Sister. I'm sorry to trouble you.

1648
02:16:04,217 --> 02:16:08,131
Do you believe in the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost?

1649
02:16:12,058 --> 02:16:16,352
Do you believe that Jesus
could heal by the laying on of hands,

1650
02:16:16,688 --> 02:16:20,638
and that he passed
this gift on to his disciples?

1651
02:16:21,943 --> 02:16:24,149
Pray with me, everyone.

1652
02:16:24,279 --> 02:16:27,612
Please pray with me. I need your faith.

1653
02:16:30,952 --> 02:16:33,324
O Lord...

1654
02:16:33,454 --> 02:16:36,491
O God, be merciful.

1655
02:16:41,129 --> 02:16:42,540
Heal.

1656
02:16:43,381 --> 02:16:44,579
Heal.

1657
02:16:50,472 --> 02:16:52,927
O God, help us in our weakness.

1658
02:16:53,850 --> 02:16:57,349
Punish us for our sins,
but reward us for our faith.

1659
02:17:01,232 --> 02:17:02,311
Heal.

1660
02:17:03,526 --> 02:17:05,151
Heal.

1661
02:17:08,823 --> 02:17:12,572
Let thy spirit fill this tabernacle.

1662
02:17:13,203 --> 02:17:16,488
Let thy holiness bless this house,

1663
02:17:16,873 --> 02:17:19,625
created for thy glory,

1664
02:17:19,751 --> 02:17:22,420
and thine alone.

1665
02:17:27,091 --> 02:17:28,467
Heal!

1666
02:17:28,593 --> 02:17:30,835
Pray for God to heal!

1667
02:17:30,970 --> 02:17:32,133
Heal!

1668
02:17:34,390 --> 02:17:36,430
God...

1669
02:17:43,817 --> 02:17:46,272
Can you hear me?

1670
02:17:49,030 --> 02:17:51,070
God, I...

1671
02:17:51,825 --> 02:17:54,825
I... I think I...

1672
02:17:57,622 --> 02:18:01,833
- Repeat after me. Blessed is the Lord.
- Blessed is the Lord.

1673
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:06,372
- We thank thee, O Lord, for thy mercy.
- We thank thee, O Lord.

1674
02:18:07,340 --> 02:18:09,380
I can hear.

1675
02:18:10,343 --> 02:18:13,677
O God... I can hear!

1676
02:18:13,805 --> 02:18:17,304
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

1677
02:18:17,433 --> 02:18:20,553
(choir sings "The Hallelujah Chorus")

1678
02:18:50,884 --> 02:18:52,960
Please wait. Please wait.

1679
02:18:53,887 --> 02:18:56,342
Don't... don't... don't get excited.

1680
02:18:58,016 --> 02:19:00,139
Oh, my God.

1681
02:19:03,104 --> 02:19:06,769
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Take care of the others, please.

1682
02:19:06,900 --> 02:19:09,355
You're in the house of God!

1683
02:19:25,793 --> 02:19:29,874
Those who believe in God will be saved.
Trust in the Lord!

1684
02:19:30,006 --> 02:19:32,164
Oh! Oh!

1685
02:20:07,752 --> 02:20:10,706
Are you all right, Shara? Shara? Shara?

1686
02:20:17,929 --> 02:20:20,800
- No. No. No. No. No!
- Shara!

1687
02:20:25,061 --> 02:20:26,686
Help!

1688
02:20:27,814 --> 02:20:29,012
No, please wait.

1689
02:20:31,526 --> 02:20:34,064
No, wait! Please, wait!

1690
02:20:44,706 --> 02:20:47,327
Wait! You must have faith!

1691
02:20:47,458 --> 02:20:49,498
- Wait!
- Shara!

1692
02:20:51,880 --> 02:20:52,911
Shara!

1693
02:20:55,550 --> 02:20:57,258
Shara!

1694
02:20:57,844 --> 02:20:59,255
Shara!

1695
02:21:00,597 --> 02:21:02,636
Shara! Shara!

1696
02:21:04,893 --> 02:21:06,173
Shara! Shara!

1697
02:23:05,472 --> 02:23:07,713
It's hers.

1698
02:23:10,143 --> 02:23:12,385
It's all we could find.

1699
02:24:00,485 --> 02:24:05,859
People everywhere would appreciate a
word from you, Mr Gantry. Anything at all.

1700
02:24:07,575 --> 02:24:10,446
Speak to us, Mr Gantry.

1701
02:24:12,872 --> 02:24:15,410
Please ask Sister Sharon to forgive us.

1702
02:24:15,542 --> 02:24:18,957
There ain't nothin' to forgive.
It was mighty hot in there.

1703
02:24:19,087 --> 02:24:21,245
Hotter than the fires of damnation.

1704
02:24:21,381 --> 02:24:23,669
I ran. I was afraid.

1705
02:24:24,759 --> 02:24:27,546
Please ask Sister not to hate me.

1706
02:24:29,931 --> 02:24:32,220
Can you hear me up there, Sister?

1707
02:24:33,393 --> 02:24:35,635
Do you hate these folks?

1708
02:24:36,855 --> 02:24:39,891
She don't hate you. She loves you.

1709
02:24:40,024 --> 02:24:42,729
Praise the Lord and his love.

1710
02:24:42,861 --> 02:24:45,268
And what is love?

1711
02:24:45,405 --> 02:24:48,690
Love is the mornin' and the evenin' star.

1712
02:24:48,825 --> 02:24:51,945
Love is the voice of music. So sing.

1713
02:24:52,078 --> 02:24:54,450
Sing out the Lord's love.

1714
02:24:59,377 --> 02:25:02,497
? I'm on my way

1715
02:25:02,630 --> 02:25:05,797
? Up to Canaan land

1716
02:25:06,759 --> 02:25:10,010
? I'm on my way

1717
02:25:10,138 --> 02:25:13,174
? Up to Canaan land

1718
02:25:14,267 --> 02:25:17,434
? I'm on my way

1719
02:25:17,562 --> 02:25:21,642
? Up to Canaan land

1720
02:25:21,774 --> 02:25:23,352
? On my way

1721
02:25:23,485 --> 02:25:25,145
? Glory, hallelujah

1722
02:25:25,278 --> 02:25:27,947
? I'm on my way

1723
02:25:28,490 --> 02:25:31,941
? It's a mighty hard climb

1724
02:25:32,076 --> 02:25:35,492
? But I'm on my way

1725
02:25:35,622 --> 02:25:38,825
? It's a mighty hard climb

1726
02:25:38,958 --> 02:25:40,998
That was inspired.

1727
02:25:41,836 --> 02:25:45,039
- Think that was inspired, Jim boy?
- I think it was real friendly.

1728
02:25:45,173 --> 02:25:48,957
You know, Shara would...
want you to go on with her work.

1729
02:25:49,093 --> 02:25:52,178
We'll get a tent - a bigger one this time.

1730
02:25:53,515 --> 02:25:57,844
"When I was a child, I spake as a child.
I understood as a child."

1731
02:25:58,728 --> 02:26:01,266
"When I became a man,
I put away childish things."

1732
02:26:01,397 --> 02:26:04,683
St Paul, First Corinthians, 13:11.

1733
02:26:07,862 --> 02:26:10,021
So long, Bill.
