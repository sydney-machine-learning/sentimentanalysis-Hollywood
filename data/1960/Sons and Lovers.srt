1
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:58,346
Morning, Tom.

2
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:19,820
Paul?

3
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,124
Yes, mum?

4
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:24,075
What you doing down
so early, son?

5
00:02:24,108 --> 00:02:25,612
I was finishing this.

6
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:27,884
My picture?
You finished that
last night.

7
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,701
Well, I changed it a bit.
Look.

8
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:31,562
Bless my soul.

9
00:02:31,662 --> 00:02:34,280
Whenever did you see me
in a hat like that?

10
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:37,517
The moment I woke up.
I suddenly said to myself,

11
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:39,756
"That's not my mother
in that nubbly old bonnet."

12
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:41,965
It's my bonnet.
What's the matter with it?

13
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:45,133
Well, I thought it could do
with a pick-me-up, that one.

14
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:47,532
I'll box your ears
for impudence.

15
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:50,285
Putting me in that sort of bobby-dazzler.

16
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:53,070
You love it, my pigeon.
You know you do.

17
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:53,820
If you were wearin' that...

18
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,991
...and I was walkin' down
the street behind you...

19
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:58,865
I'd say, "doesn't that little person
fancy herself?"

20
00:02:58,965 --> 00:02:59,915
Well, she doesn't...

21
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:02,429
She's not at all sure
that it suits her.

22
00:03:03,054 --> 00:03:04,145
I suppose you'd rather be
in dirty black...

23
00:03:04,245 --> 00:03:06,063
...looking as though you were
wrapped in burnt paper.

24
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:09,102
To me,
it's right for you.

25
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:10,471
It's too young for me.

26
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:11,471
Oh, it's too young,
is it?

27
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:12,517
Why don't you buy some false white hair...

28
00:03:12,617 --> 00:03:14,184
...and stick it on your head?

29
00:03:15,438 --> 00:03:16,582
I'll be white soon enough.

30
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,382
Don't you dare.

31
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:20,623
What would I want
with a white-haired mother?

32
00:03:20,655 --> 00:03:24,208
Paul, don't. Not those knives.
Go on. I'll manage.

33
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,480
All right.
If you don't need me,
I'll go on.

34
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:27,695
Where are you going, son?

35
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:29,295
To see Miriam.

36
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:31,472
Can't you wait till
you've had your breakfast?

37
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,191
I've had some toast.
That's all I want.

38
00:03:34,224 --> 00:03:36,240
Miriam Leivers must be
marvellously fascinating.

39
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,935
If you can't wait
till the sun's up

40
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,535
Before you go traipsing off
to that farm again.

41
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:41,360
Well, I like Miriam.

42
00:03:41,391 --> 00:03:43,153
Uh, I'll start work next week,
and I won't see her for a while.

43
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:44,783
Like her?

44
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:47,249
Seems there's no one else
for you but her now.

45
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:49,936
Oh, nonsense, mother.
You talk as if we're lovers.

46
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:51,504
She doesn't
even walk with my arm.

47
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:53,616
Why are you always
flying off to her, then?

48
00:03:53,648 --> 00:03:54,833
I like to talk to her.

49
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:57,841
Is there no one else
to talk to?

50
00:03:57,872 --> 00:03:59,906
Not about
the things we talk of.

51
00:04:00,872 --> 00:04:01,906
What things?

52
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:02,721
Painting and books.

53
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:05,722
You don't care about Herbert Spencer
or Robert--

54
00:04:05,822 --> 00:04:07,419
How do you know I don't care about
Herbert Spencer?

55
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,337
Do you ever try me?

56
00:04:09,368 --> 00:04:11,281
Mother, it's different.
Miriam and I are young--

57
00:04:11,314 --> 00:04:14,898
And I'm old.
Now we get to the truth of it.

58
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:17,778
and it's not in that drawing.

59
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:22,194
Yes, I may stand aside.
I'm only good enough to wait on you.

60
00:04:22,226 --> 00:04:24,241
Miriam has all the rest.

61
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:26,250
They're coming down,
and the kettle not boiling.

62
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:27,250
Good-bye, mum.

63
00:04:27,282 --> 00:04:29,459
Oh.

64
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:49,203
Here, dad.
Look at Paul's latest.

65
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:50,885
Who's it supposed to be, then?

66
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:52,885
You know well enough,
and I think it's good.

67
00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:56,083
You'd look a proper gabby, you would,
dressed in a bonnet like that.

68
00:04:56,115 --> 00:04:58,259
I don't see why.

69
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,909
Are you limping, son?

70
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:00,737
Oh, it's nothing, mother.

71
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,364
They was betting me last night I couldn't
dive into the canal off of the bridge.

72
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:06,149
And you did?

73
00:05:06,392 --> 00:05:08,149
Aye, I went right
to the bottom.

74
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,484
Scraped my knee
on some old tin cans.

75
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:11,413
But I won two shillings.

76
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:13,301
You're a wild one.

77
00:05:13,332 --> 00:05:17,525
Two bob, eh? You be in
the moon and stars tonight?

78
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:19,963
Oh, I thought I might
take mother to the fair.

79
00:05:20,063 --> 00:05:21,303
Hey, mother,
do you want to come to the fair?

80
00:05:21,503 --> 00:05:22,804
I'll see.

81
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:25,206
Take your dad to a pint
in the stars first, son.

82
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:27,350
I might, at that.

83
00:05:27,382 --> 00:05:28,625
Dad, you've spoiled it.

84
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:29,910
What?

85
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:31,016
The sketch.

86
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,846
Oh, oh.
We'll soon get that right.

87
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:36,470
Give it here.

88
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:40,341
No, no, no.
You're making it worse.

89
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:42,327
What are you doing with that?

90
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:45,079
Nothing, lass. Just a little accident.
We'll soon have it.

91
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,582
You've ruined it.

92
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,182
Well, he can soon
knock off another, can't he?

93
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,519
He's got nothing else to do
but lie up there in bed.

94
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,527
He was up hours before you, working
on this sketch you've just spoiled.

95
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:55,576
and how much were
we going to get for that?

96
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,071
He'll bring home his share
when he starts work next week.

97
00:05:58,103 --> 00:06:00,024
Work? That lad
doesn't know what work is.

98
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:02,040
Sitting on his bottom
all week in an office.

99
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,888
Scholarships and holidays
and spouting algebra,

100
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,096
While we're sweating down there
Like suffocating bats.

101
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:09,689
Aye. Well, hurry up and stop your shouting,
'Cause we're late.

102
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,897
He only shouts when he knows
he's in the wrong.

103
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:13,656
He's only getting half
as much as Arthur anyway.

104
00:06:13,688 --> 00:06:15,737
Now, if that lad was
to go down the pit--

105
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:18,360
He's not going down the pit,
and you know it.

106
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:20,889
He's going to earn
decent money one day.

107
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:24,632
Decent? What we get's
indecent, I suppose?

108
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:26,905
Come on, dad,
and stop your shouting.

109
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:30,008
And I'm keeping him where
he'll get his chance--

110
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,345
Above the ground.

111
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:14,364
Oh! Oh, it's you.

112
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:18,812
Oh. Good morning, my lady.
You look more beautiful than ever.

113
00:07:18,844 --> 00:07:21,628
I'm sure she's the dark lady
of the sonnets.

114
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,508
Oh, no.
She's the lady of the lake.

115
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:28,060
Ha, ha, ha.
Oh, it's good to be up here.

116
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:30,589
When I came up this morning,

117
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:33,597
I stopped for a moment to look off
at Nottingham in the distance.

118
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:37,692
And I imagined it to be London.
I saw myself in my own studio by the river.

119
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:40,492
Painting beautiful women
all day.

120
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:42,492
Huh. No.

121
00:07:42,524 --> 00:07:48,157
Painting life, real people and
real things, wherever I find them.

122
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:49,934
That's what you want
more than anything, isn't it?

123
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:51,934
Yes.

124
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:56,413
But the place where you were born
and grew up isn't so easy to throw off.

125
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:59,774
My mother's had
a very hard time.

126
00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:02,367
I owe her a great deal, and I want
to repay her somehow.

127
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,831
I want to do something too.

128
00:08:04,862 --> 00:08:07,295
I want a chance to be somebody.

129
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:13,822
I forgot to bring
that book of Shelley.

130
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:15,838
I'll bring it tomorrow.

131
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,598
You know, my mother
disapproves more and more

132
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,552
Of the books you bring.

133
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,207
She blames you for
putting ideas into my head.

134
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:24,991
Does she think
heaven frowns on ideas?

135
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:27,551
Your mother breathes religion
through her nostrils.

136
00:08:27,582 --> 00:08:29,343
Do you think that's wrong?

137
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,776
It's not religious
Just to be religious.

138
00:08:33,984 --> 00:08:38,048
I think a crow is religious
a

139
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,569
It's showing the glory of god,
but it doesn't know it.

140
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,545
God doesn't know things.
He is things.

141
00:08:44,576 --> 00:08:47,233
I don't think my mother
would understand that.

142
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:49,378
But I do.

143
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:58,817
Looking at you now,
there's more religion in you...

144
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:01,218
Than your mother could ever
learn from the saints.

145
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:12,067
What is it?

146
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:15,905
It's the mine!

147
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:45,543
Jimmy, you all right?

148
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:27,689
My son?

149
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,401
My son.

150
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:14,364
It's a sad homecoming
For you, William.

151
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:16,364
Yes, mother.

152
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:18,572
I'll put the kettle on.

153
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:47,053
Well, William,
How is the job?

154
00:12:47,085 --> 00:12:48,557
Well,
I like London, mother.

155
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,061
You can, uh,
have a lot of fun there.

156
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:51,373
That wasn't
what I asked, son.

157
00:12:51,406 --> 00:12:53,070
Oh, the job's all right.

158
00:12:53,101 --> 00:12:55,117
I hope you're getting
your sleep.

159
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,686
You can't go working
in that shop all day

160
00:12:56,717 --> 00:12:57,967
and gallivanting all night.

161
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,663
The human frame
won't stand it.

162
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:02,414
I'll try, mother.

163
00:13:02,446 --> 00:13:05,518
Well, Paul, when do you
start work at Jordan's?

164
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,327
Next week,
But I've been thinking.

165
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:11,439
It won't pay much,

166
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:15,023
and now
with Arthur...gone,

167
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:17,159
I think I should
go down the mine.

168
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,159
You haven't seen enough today?

169
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:19,727
It won't be forever,

170
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,135
Just till we get
Back on our feet.

171
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,959
We'll manage.

172
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:24,623
I don't want you
wasting yourself

173
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:26,127
Instead of finding
a place in the world.

174
00:13:26,158 --> 00:13:28,464
Is Jordan's
a place in the world?

175
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:30,896
Making out orders for elastic stockings
and women's corsets?

176
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:33,680
It's better than coal dust
and drink. You prefer that?

177
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:36,113
William, tell him.

178
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:39,345
Tell him how you felt when the letter came,
saying you'd got the job.

179
00:13:39,376 --> 00:13:41,296
Tell him.

180
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:46,641
I'd have worked for a shilling
a week, and slept by the river because--

181
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:48,465
Because it was a start.

182
00:13:48,672 --> 00:13:50,065
I'd escaped.

183
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,082
Stick to what
you are, son.

184
00:13:52,113 --> 00:13:53,250
Don't let yourself
be dragged down.

185
00:13:53,313 --> 00:13:55,250
That will do!

186
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:58,226
So he'll be dragged down,
will he?

187
00:13:58,256 --> 00:14:01,297
What's good enough for me
isn't good enough for him?

188
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:03,953
My father sent me
down the pit when I was 12.

189
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:05,491
And you sent Arthur!

190
00:14:08,336 --> 00:14:13,234
He wanted it. You'll not
hold that against me.

191
00:14:13,265 --> 00:14:16,818
You've no right to set
your sons against their father.

192
00:14:16,849 --> 00:14:20,562
When a man tries hard for his family,
he wants a bit of respect, a bit of gratitude.

193
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:24,051
You treat me like a dog.
you lot think you're so fine

194
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,963
Because you won't get dirt
in your hands and coal on your faces!

195
00:14:26,994 --> 00:14:29,298
What's so fine about sitting
on a stool six days a week

196
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,180
and having a few shillings left
to buy a new seat for your britches?

197
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:34,835
And what do you do with all
the money you've got left?

198
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:38,836
The same as I'm gonna do now.

199
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:43,668
I'll see you again
when I see you.

200
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:45,779
and it'll be
before I want to.

201
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:51,605
Nottingham, Melton Mowbray,

202
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:55,477
Kettering, London train!

203
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:59,316
Well, son, I hope you'll come back
to a happier house at Christmas.

204
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:04,693
Mother, it didn't seem right to tell you
this after, well, after Arthur, but--

205
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:07,413
I've met a wonderful girl, mother.
I'm going to get married.

206
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:11,541
- Who is she?
- Her name is Louisa Lily Isobel Western.

207
00:15:11,572 --> 00:15:14,645
All the men have been running after her,
But I'm the one she's picked.

208
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:18,262
I hope that's not why you went chasing her,
because all the others were running.

209
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:20,341
Here.

210
00:15:20,374 --> 00:15:22,805
Why, she's got a naked bust.

211
00:15:22,837 --> 00:15:25,238
You sound like Miriam's mother.
She's got beautiful shoulders.

212
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,638
I didn't expect to see so much of them
at the first view.

213
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:30,615
Wait till you meet her, mother.
You won't blame me then.

214
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:33,238
You should see all the eyes
when I walk down Piccadilly with her.

215
00:15:33,271 --> 00:15:36,246
Well, no wonder, if that's all she wears.
Good-bye, love. Take care of yourself.

216
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:37,648
And don't forget to get
your proper rest.

217
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:38,648
Bye-bye, mother.

218
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:41,175
Good-bye, Will.
Good-bye.

219
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,222
Oh. The photograph!

220
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:43,222
What?

221
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:45,007
The photograph!

222
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,455
Spending all his money
on a dressed-up creature.

223
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:04,824
No, the creature's naked,
mother.

224
00:16:07,832 --> 00:16:13,112
It's strange to think...She means
more to him now than his own mother.

225
00:16:13,143 --> 00:16:14,665
Oh, what nonsense you talk.

226
00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:16,665
It's true.

227
00:16:16,697 --> 00:16:20,665
Oh, I know it's silly,
but that's the way mothers are.

228
00:16:20,696 --> 00:16:24,121
Well, I shan't get married
as long as I've got you.

229
00:16:24,154 --> 00:16:27,641
I'll get rich with my painting, and
we'll see the world together.

230
00:16:27,673 --> 00:16:30,874
and for a start, I'm going to take you
for a special treat to Nottingham.

231
00:16:30,905 --> 00:16:32,986
Now, Paul, you know
we can't afford treats.

232
00:16:33,017 --> 00:16:36,603
Well, this is a treat
we can afford. It's a surprise.

233
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:54,204
Why, there's Miriam.

234
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,162
Did you invite her here?

235
00:16:57,834 --> 00:16:59,162
Yes.

236
00:16:59,195 --> 00:17:01,820
It's a wonder
her mother allows it.

237
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:05,500
She ought to be helping up at the farm
instead of wandering about down here.

238
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:07,276
Poor Miriam.

239
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:10,387
I want you to look at
this picture she's looking at.

240
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:12,668
Hello, Mrs. Morel.

241
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:18,107
Oh, Paul.

242
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:19,853
Well?

243
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,853
Yes.

244
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:24,509
You've got
the way he looks now.

245
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,557
I wish you'd seen him
as he was.

246
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:31,004
It's wonderful, Paul. Wonderful.
Don't you think so, Mrs. Morel?

247
00:17:31,037 --> 00:17:33,373
It's the best thing here.

248
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:36,157
Come away a minute.
Come over here.

249
00:17:38,044 --> 00:17:40,125
I want to watch them
look at it.

250
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,514
They don't like it.

251
00:17:49,766 --> 00:17:51,614
It's too good for them.

252
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:53,694
Don't be so touchy, son.

253
00:17:56,893 --> 00:17:59,550
Watch this one.

254
00:18:12,895 --> 00:18:14,487
He can tell.

255
00:18:14,695 --> 00:18:15,487
What?

256
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,888
I've had no training.

257
00:18:17,918 --> 00:18:19,504
I wish I hadn't sent it in.

258
00:18:19,635 --> 00:18:21,335
I've got a good mind
to take it down.

259
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,551
That wizen-hearted
old stick!

260
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:26,175
What does he know
about pictures?

261
00:18:29,023 --> 00:18:30,240
Look.

262
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,396
It's good.

263
00:18:34,587 --> 00:18:36,096
It's excellent.

264
00:18:36,129 --> 00:18:38,945
Well, they like it.

265
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:43,393
Aren't you going to tell me
what a fine fellow I am?

266
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:45,888
Why don't you praise me
to the skies?

267
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:48,066
Because I'll have the trouble
of dragging you down.

268
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:50,177
Wait.
I'll catch up to you.

269
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:52,033
He's not certain
of himself.

270
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,914
He wants someone
to urge him on.

271
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:59,937
I'd like him to fall in love
with the right girl.

272
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:01,747
Someone strong.

273
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:03,747
Stronger than you?

274
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:07,522
If she was really right for him,
she would be stronger than me.

275
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:12,419
Come on.

276
00:19:17,826 --> 00:19:20,323
Waiting up for me, lass?

277
00:19:20,353 --> 00:19:23,299
I've been giving them a hand at the pub,
washing out the glasses.

278
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,538
They chose the right one
for the job.

279
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,067
Two hours, no stopping.
What do you think Fred gives me?

280
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:30,531
Nothing but a lousy
half-crown.

281
00:19:30,562 --> 00:19:32,419
I expect he thought
you made the rest up in beer.

282
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,459
That I haven't.
I've been to the fair.

283
00:19:35,492 --> 00:19:37,732
Uh, who might this be?

284
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:40,452
That's the young lady
Our William's walking out with.

285
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:43,235
Her name's Louisa Lily
Isobel Western.

286
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,028
Ha. Come again tomorrow.

287
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,332
She looks a bright spark,
She does.

288
00:19:47,363 --> 00:19:48,936
Is she an actress?

289
00:19:48,963 --> 00:19:50,436
She is not.

290
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:51,844
She's supposed to be
a lady.

291
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:54,309
and no clothes
to show for it.

292
00:19:54,341 --> 00:19:55,845
Lads would like to have her
down the pits.

293
00:19:55,941 --> 00:19:57,445
Walter!

294
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:04,101
I brought thee a coconut,
lass.

295
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:05,534
How much did you pay for that?

296
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:06,534
Nowt, I won it at the fair.

297
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:09,701
They let you shy for it
for free, did they?

298
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:12,677
Ah, thou never said thank you
for anything in thy life.

299
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:15,751
If thou must know,
I spent fourpence on it.

300
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:18,310
I remembered how much
you like coconuts.

301
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:20,422
Where did you get that idea?

302
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:23,430
That time at the goose fair,
when we was courtin'.

303
00:20:23,463 --> 00:20:27,430
Hmm. You said if I didn't win thee
a coconut, you wouldn't marry me.

304
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:29,414
That was
a long time ago, Walter.

305
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:32,358
Hmm. Always taking the curl
out of me, you were.

306
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:34,375
It didn't seem
to make much difference.

307
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:37,254
Well, I'm uncurled now,
aren't i?

308
00:20:37,287 --> 00:20:39,944
You can be proud
of yourself for that.

309
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:43,911
There you are.
Best get upstairs and sleep it off.

310
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,631
Can't even have a pint of beer
after a hard day's work

311
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,359
But I have to be told
I'm drunk.

312
00:20:48,391 --> 00:20:50,600
And so you are, most nights.

313
00:20:50,632 --> 00:20:53,096
It's got so I almost
dread you coming home.

314
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,112
Right. Well, you said it.

315
00:20:55,143 --> 00:20:56,225
There's only
one answer to that.

316
00:20:56,343 --> 00:20:57,225
Go on to bed.

317
00:20:57,255 --> 00:21:00,520
And to think I spent fourpence
trying to please thee.

318
00:21:00,553 --> 00:21:02,537
Mucky little hussy!

319
00:21:08,585 --> 00:21:10,113
Hello, mum.

320
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:11,113
Hello, son.

321
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,289
Have you had anything to eat?

322
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,392
Yes, mother.
I had supper with Miriam.

323
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:18,058
Oh.

324
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:22,826
Mother,
why don't you like her?

325
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:24,168
Oh, I've tried, Paul.

326
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:28,970
I-- I feel she wants to...
Shut me out.

327
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,546
She'd leave me no room.

328
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,946
I wouldn't let
any girl do that.

329
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:36,426
She's no ordinary girl, Paul.
With Miriam Leivers, I feel...

330
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,019
She wants all of you
all of the time.

331
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,379
She'd leave nothing
for anyone else, not even yourself.

332
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:46,698
Oh, you are exaggerating.
I know she's a bit intense.

333
00:21:46,731 --> 00:21:49,580
You'll not
be seeing me again.

334
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,331
You'll be wanting
your boots, then.

335
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,539
What does he mean?

336
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,939
He's running away.
He's run away before.

337
00:22:04,972 --> 00:22:10,124
Once, when you were very small,
he even got past the local pub.

338
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:30,061
Gertrude. Gertrude morel.

339
00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:31,406
There's a contraption outside.

340
00:22:31,493 --> 00:22:32,206
A contraption?

341
00:22:32,236 --> 00:22:34,989
Aye, a motorcar.
It's stopped outside your front door.

342
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,022
Good day to you, madam.

343
00:22:48,854 --> 00:22:50,318
This wizen-hearted old stick

344
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:52,558
Would like to see
Mr. Paul Morel.

345
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:54,542
I do beg your pardon.

346
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:57,967
I should think so indeed.
Is he at home?

347
00:22:57,998 --> 00:22:59,567
Well,
he's out at present,

348
00:22:59,598 --> 00:23:01,006
Collecting
his father's wages,

349
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,183
But he won't be long.
Will you come inside?

350
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:06,031
I'm Mr. Hadlock.
Henry Hadlock.

351
00:23:06,062 --> 00:23:09,871
Uh, this is the way.
The kettle's on the boil.

352
00:23:09,904 --> 00:23:11,432
I'll make you a cup of tea.

353
00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:12,432
Thank you.

354
00:23:16,526 --> 00:23:18,144
Come away from there.
You'll make it explode.

355
00:23:19,744 --> 00:23:21,684
What's this?

356
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:23,984
It's a contraption.

357
00:23:24,015 --> 00:23:25,999
There's a man inside
come to see you.

358
00:23:26,032 --> 00:23:27,953
Very grand from the gentry.

359
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,616
I've not been down
a mine myself, naturally.

360
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:35,825
But I could see at once
the truth in your son's--

361
00:23:35,856 --> 00:23:38,705
Paul. Paul, this is
Mr. Henry Hadlock from Nottingham.

362
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:40,593
He did like your picture.
He's bought it.

363
00:23:40,624 --> 00:23:42,929
He says you're going to be
A very fine painter.

364
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,341
Do you mean that, sir?

365
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,841
My dear boy, I didn't
Motor all this way down

366
00:23:45,872 --> 00:23:47,825
In order to fill my lungs
With coal dust.

367
00:23:47,856 --> 00:23:50,193
Would you like
To go to London?

368
00:23:50,225 --> 00:23:51,857
London?

369
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,810
Oh, don't tell me
You've never heard of it.

370
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:55,986
It's south of Nottingham
and a good deal larger.

371
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,619
Yes, sir. I know.

372
00:23:57,649 --> 00:23:59,602
Go to some big
Art school there,

373
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:01,617
And after two or three years,

374
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,562
Well, you might show signs of
Producing something worthwhile.

375
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:06,274
But I haven't got the money
for that.

376
00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:08,274
He's very slow, isn't he?

377
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:11,666
The only reason I'm here
is that I like to help young artists.

378
00:24:11,699 --> 00:24:14,227
and if the gamble comes off,
To help myself too.

379
00:24:14,258 --> 00:24:16,147
I'm not a charitable
institution.

380
00:24:16,178 --> 00:24:18,610
I shall expect
to get my return on you.

381
00:24:18,643 --> 00:24:23,506
W-well-- i--
I don't know what to say.

382
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:25,971
Might I suggest the choice
of one of two words,

383
00:24:26,004 --> 00:24:27,508
Both quite easy to pronounce?

384
00:24:28,595 --> 00:24:30,867
Yes or no?

385
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,204
Oh, it's a great chance,
isn't it, mother?

386
00:24:33,235 --> 00:24:35,572
Oh, good gracious.
Haven't you got a mind of your own?

387
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:37,493
When would he have to leave?

388
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:39,765
As soon as possible.
no more shilly-shallying.

389
00:24:42,677 --> 00:24:46,229
This is my husband.
Walter, this is Mr. Henry Hadlock.

390
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,588
How do? Oh, shovel dirt.

391
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,317
Now I see the original.

392
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:54,197
You've got it very well,
the inarticulate primitive.

393
00:24:54,228 --> 00:24:56,389
The what?

394
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,389
Mr. Hadlock's bought
the picture I did of you.

395
00:24:58,421 --> 00:25:00,885
What, he wants a picture
of me on his wall?

396
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:02,934
How much did he pay?

397
00:25:02,965 --> 00:25:04,918
I-- I forgot to ask.

398
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,701
Twenty pounds.

399
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,701
Twenty pound?

400
00:25:07,734 --> 00:25:09,270
I'd work two months without
seeing the light of day

401
00:25:09,302 --> 00:25:10,742
and not earn that.

402
00:25:10,772 --> 00:25:12,789
See here, Mr. Haddock.

403
00:25:12,822 --> 00:25:14,998
It's me you're buying
in that picture.

404
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,878
Here's the real thing.
Twenty pounds'worth of sweat here.

405
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:20,054
Go on, feel it.
Walter!

406
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,166
Thank you. I have already
captured the atmosphere.

407
00:25:22,197 --> 00:25:24,310
Come and see me tomorrow.
We'll make our plans.

408
00:25:24,343 --> 00:25:25,811
Thank you, sir.

409
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:27,511
4:00 will do.
Don't you dare to let me down.

410
00:25:27,543 --> 00:25:28,471
He won't.

411
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:30,071
I must go.
I've got quite a long journey.

412
00:25:30,102 --> 00:25:31,704
Why must you act like that?

413
00:25:31,734 --> 00:25:33,494
I'm not loved here
'Cause I'm low,

414
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:35,736
So I act low.

415
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,104
Isn't it wonderful?

416
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,104
Yes, it is.
I must go tell Miriam.

417
00:25:58,521 --> 00:26:00,311
What are you
trying to catch, Hubert?

418
00:26:00,344 --> 00:26:03,417
Grasshopper. I've caught it.
I've caught it.

419
00:26:06,904 --> 00:26:08,216
It's gone.

420
00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:09,402
Oh, I love you, I love you.

421
00:26:09,432 --> 00:26:11,288
Don't, Miriam!
Don't, Miriam!

422
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:12,326
Let me go!

423
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:13,626
Show me you love me.

424
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:16,601
Let him go, Miriam.

425
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:18,904
You want to keep smothering
the child all the time for?

426
00:26:18,937 --> 00:26:21,242
Oh, mother.
Is it so wrong for me

427
00:26:21,272 --> 00:26:22,874
To love my own little brother?

428
00:26:22,905 --> 00:26:26,041
Love is a thing of the spirit.
We have it inside us.

429
00:26:26,074 --> 00:26:28,634
We don't have to show it
with our arms and lips.

430
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:31,163
Come on, Hubert.
It's time to wash for tea.

431
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,579
Shall I keep you here
or let you go? Huh?

432
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,594
Let me go.
You want to go? You sure?

433
00:26:45,627 --> 00:26:49,212
You want to go far away.
Stop it.

434
00:26:49,242 --> 00:26:51,995
Look how you come back to me.
Don't. No higher.

435
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:54,044
That's not a bit high,silly.
No higher.

436
00:26:54,074 --> 00:26:56,795
You want to go higher?
Let me down.

437
00:27:05,115 --> 00:27:06,589
It's a treat of a swing.

438
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:08,276
I'm goin' to
the top of the world.

439
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:09,725
You comin' with me? No?

440
00:27:09,956 --> 00:27:11,237
What you gonna do without me?

441
00:27:11,356 --> 00:27:12,837
You'll be back.

442
00:27:12,968 --> 00:27:15,069
Are you sure?

443
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:18,845
Paul?

444
00:27:18,876 --> 00:27:21,244
Paul? Paul, where are you?

445
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:33,501
Paul, whe-- where did
You get all this money?

446
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:35,358
Paul, come down!

447
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:38,654
Ah. Women are all the same.

448
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:41,437
They always want to drag a man
down to their own level.

449
00:27:41,469 --> 00:27:43,422
Where did you get them from?
What's happened?

450
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,143
My whole life's changed,
that's what's happened.

451
00:27:45,173 --> 00:27:45,973
Sit down.

452
00:27:46,173 --> 00:27:48,158
Everything I've always wanted
is coming to me now.

453
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:49,855
My life's beginning at last.

454
00:27:49,887 --> 00:27:51,486
It's really beginning.
How do you mean? What--

455
00:27:51,518 --> 00:27:52,863
There's a man come
From Nottingham,

456
00:27:52,894 --> 00:27:54,334
and he's bought my painting,

457
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:55,999
and he's gonna send me
To London.

458
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,143
What do you think of that?
London?

459
00:27:58,175 --> 00:28:00,287
He's going to have me trained.
Paul, are you serious?

460
00:28:00,318 --> 00:28:02,272
I've got a patron.
When do you go?

461
00:28:02,302 --> 00:28:04,992
All the pictures I want to paint, 
and they'll be shown in a gallery.

462
00:28:05,022 --> 00:28:06,059
Paul, I'm so glad for you.

463
00:28:06,422 --> 00:28:07,359
I'm gonna be famous,
and I might even be rich.

464
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,247
And do you know
the funny thing about it?

465
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,840
This man,
this wonderful man--

466
00:28:11,871 --> 00:28:13,856
Oh, listen.
Please listen.

467
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:15,777
He's the same man we saw
that day in the castle,

468
00:28:15,808 --> 00:28:17,345
The one that hated my picture.

469
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:18,944
That's what I thought--
Have you finished?

470
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:20,116
May I say something?

471
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:21,303
Can I get a word in edgeways?

472
00:28:21,448 --> 00:28:22,303
What?

473
00:28:22,336 --> 00:28:25,377
It doesn't matter.

474
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:27,328
Of course it matters.
It's wonderful, isn't it?

475
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,888
It's the most wonderful thing
that ever happened, isn't it?

476
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,505
Oh, yes. It's wonderful.

477
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:32,705
Everything's wonderful.

478
00:28:32,737 --> 00:28:35,138
and you're wonderful.

479
00:28:56,258 --> 00:29:00,067
What are you frightened of?
Paul, I--

480
00:29:00,097 --> 00:29:03,139
I can't always be
so spiritual with you.

481
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:11,619
Perhaps it's a good thing
I'm going away.

482
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,762
Oh, no. Don't say that.

483
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,458
I'm going to miss you
so much.

484
00:29:15,491 --> 00:29:17,156
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

485
00:29:17,186 --> 00:29:20,258
No. You'll only miss
a disembodied spirit,not a man.

486
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,660
Not somebody
made of flesh and blood.

487
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:24,803
I am flesh and blood,
you know.

488
00:29:24,835 --> 00:29:27,107
I've got a heart that beats.
Feel it.

489
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,604
and my blood tingles.

490
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:32,835
Don't you think
we've been a--

491
00:29:32,868 --> 00:29:35,267
A little too fierce
in what they call purity?

492
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,533
Being afraid isn't--
isn't pure.

493
00:29:39,972 --> 00:29:42,084
It's a sort of dirtiness.

494
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,044
Oh, I want you,

495
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,966
and I want to love you.

496
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:05,445
I'm sorry.

497
00:30:05,478 --> 00:30:08,902
I-if you could... Help me.

498
00:30:10,117 --> 00:30:12,551
Teach me not to be ashamed.

499
00:30:24,486 --> 00:30:27,238
If you would have me,
you wouldn't be ashamed.

500
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:31,384
We belong to each other,
don't we?

501
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:33,384
Yes.

502
00:30:36,007 --> 00:30:37,775
Then won't you trust me?

503
00:30:38,007 --> 00:30:40,775
Oh, it's not that.
It's--

504
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:43,272
What?
I don't know!

505
00:30:46,695 --> 00:30:48,944
I'm afraid.

506
00:30:48,995 --> 00:30:51,944
Miriam? Miriam, where are you?

507
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:54,984
I must go.

508
00:31:04,168 --> 00:31:06,473
You shall have me.

509
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,090
Miriam!

510
00:31:15,593 --> 00:31:17,993
Oh, there you are.

511
00:31:18,025 --> 00:31:19,186
What is it?

512
00:31:19,225 --> 00:31:22,186
Nothing.
I'm out of breath.

513
00:31:22,217 --> 00:31:24,809
You've been running away
from Paul.

514
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:26,730
I know why.

515
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:28,091
It's horrible.

516
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,091
Mother, why must
it be horrible?

517
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:33,322
The Good Lord willed that we should
be born into this world to suffer.

518
00:31:33,355 --> 00:31:37,322
He willed that we should
love each other, didn't he?

519
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:40,907
and that when we love,
it should be a joy.

520
00:31:40,938 --> 00:31:42,451
Isn't that what marriage
is supposed to be?

521
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:43,851
We marry to have children.

522
00:31:43,883 --> 00:31:45,964
and to fulfil that duty,
we have to suffer.

523
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:51,563
This... Between men
and women is ugly.

524
00:31:51,596 --> 00:31:52,843
It's dreadful,
but we have to endure it

525
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:54,508
If our union is to be blessed.

526
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:55,759
Mummy!

527
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,259
Wait a minute, HUBERT.
I'm coming.

528
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:58,796
Why must it be ugly?

529
00:31:58,827 --> 00:32:01,068
You wicked girl.

530
00:32:02,507 --> 00:32:04,556
Pray to the good lord
to forgive you.

531
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:07,021
May he keep you pure
in mind and spirit

532
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:08,236
and protect you
With his strength

533
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:09,708
From the sins
of the flesh.

534
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,056
Mummy, where are you?

535
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,556
All right, Hubert!

536
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,951
Oh, Lord...

537
00:32:38,094 --> 00:32:42,382
Keep me from loving Paul morel
If I ought not to love him.

538
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:49,359
But if I may love him,

539
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,463
Let me love him splendidly.

540
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:19,919
Oh, you clumsy
drunken fool.

541
00:33:19,951 --> 00:33:22,000
Who says I'm drunk?
It's an accident.

542
00:33:22,032 --> 00:33:23,321
Say you're not drunk,
if you can.

543
00:33:23,332 --> 00:33:24,721
"say you're not drunk."

544
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:27,056
Only a fancy hussy like thee
could have such a thought.

545
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:30,033
You bring home little enough money
without wasting good food,

546
00:33:30,065 --> 00:33:32,242
Though there's always
enough to get drunk on.

547
00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:34,321
Well, this is your supper
I'm throwing away.

548
00:33:34,353 --> 00:33:36,337
It's my money,
and it's my house,

549
00:33:36,368 --> 00:33:39,058
and if you don't like my house,
you can get out of it.

550
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:40,725
This'll do for me.

551
00:33:40,889 --> 00:33:42,225
You leave that alone.
That's for Paul, now.

552
00:33:42,257 --> 00:33:44,785
Paul, Paul, Paul.
He can buy his own food now, can't he?

553
00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:47,154
Give it over. You can cut yourself
some bread and dripping.

554
00:33:47,184 --> 00:33:48,754
Oh, I can, can i?

555
00:33:48,786 --> 00:33:51,698
Then we'll all have
some bread and dripping!

556
00:33:54,737 --> 00:33:56,690
You're the most
despicable creature

557
00:33:56,723 --> 00:33:58,418
That ever walked
in shoe leather.

558
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,587
Shut your face, woman.
Go on. Get the dripping!

559
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:04,084
Not even a knife
to cut the bread with.

560
00:34:09,266 --> 00:34:13,138
You clumsy, drunken lout.
The house is filthy with you.

561
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,506
Then get out of it!

562
00:34:15,538 --> 00:34:18,451
Go on, then!
Get out of my house!

563
00:34:18,483 --> 00:34:20,627
No, walter.
Get out!

564
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,675
No, Walter!

565
00:34:22,707 --> 00:34:24,660
Walter! Let me in!

566
00:34:24,692 --> 00:34:26,964
Don't be silly, Walter.
Let me in.

567
00:34:26,995 --> 00:34:29,076
Walter. Walter!

568
00:34:38,965 --> 00:34:41,078
Oh, dear.

569
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:01,943
Oh, the nuisance.
The nuisance.

570
00:35:06,742 --> 00:35:08,342
Paul?

571
00:35:08,374 --> 00:35:11,254
Mother. What happened?

572
00:35:11,285 --> 00:35:13,094
It's your father.
He came home drunk and---

573
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:15,094
What happened?

574
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:18,519
I'm locked out. It's a good job
the neighbors didn't hear.

575
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:24,120
They'll hear this!

576
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:30,007
You drunken coward!
What's that?

577
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:32,248
You coward! You wouldn't dare-
Paul, no! He's your father!-

578
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,488
What? You young jockey,
you'll get--

579
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:36,088
You call that a father?

580
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,008
I'll let him know what
it feels like to be his son!

581
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:40,183
Couldn't bear it.
Don't ever think it.

582
00:35:40,214 --> 00:35:44,729
I'm sick to death
of all of you.

583
00:35:55,735 --> 00:35:58,201
Let me see here.

584
00:35:58,232 --> 00:36:00,329
Mother, sleep on the couch
in the parlor tonight,

585
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:02,161
Not with him.

586
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:04,440
I'll sleep in my own bed.
Why?

587
00:36:04,472 --> 00:36:06,197
I'll sleep in my own bed.

588
00:36:06,472 --> 00:36:07,897
Mother, you can't love him now,
not after all--

589
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:12,122
He had all of my love once, Paul,
a long time ago. He was different then.

590
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:15,451
He was so handsome with his way
of laughing. He was always laughing.

591
00:36:15,482 --> 00:36:17,402
I loved him then.

592
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:19,417
I don't want to hear
any more.

593
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:23,258
The first day I saw him,
I felt as if I'd--I'd drunk wine.

594
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:26,138
I thought he was so brave
working down there under the earth.

595
00:36:26,169 --> 00:36:28,537
He only laughed and he said,
"Oh, you get used to it.

596
00:36:28,569 --> 00:36:31,834
You pop out at night,like the mice,
to see what's going on."

597
00:36:31,866 --> 00:36:35,612
If he was a man then,
why did he stop?

598
00:36:35,642 --> 00:36:38,843
Because I made him
face things.

599
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:42,972
This house-- he-- he told me
that he owned this house.

600
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:44,731
It was only a week
before William was born

601
00:36:44,762 --> 00:36:46,331
I found out we only rented it.

602
00:36:46,362 --> 00:36:50,427
We-- we didn't even own
the furniture.

603
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:51,964
Did you tell him
you'd found out?

604
00:36:51,995 --> 00:36:55,260
He couldn't bear that.

605
00:36:55,291 --> 00:37:01,149
He'd promised to give me all the things
 he thought a lady ought to have,

606
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:05,053
and I made him see there was
nothing behind all his show.

607
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:09,244
I don't think he ever
forgave me for that.

608
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:14,302
and now he's what he is,
and i--

609
00:37:22,236 --> 00:37:23,486
Good night, son.

610
00:37:23,636 --> 00:37:25,086
I'm not going to London.

611
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:29,405
I can't leave you
alone with him.

612
00:37:29,438 --> 00:37:31,454
You can't throw away the only
chance you've ever had.

613
00:37:31,485 --> 00:37:32,925
You're more important
than anything I do.

614
00:37:32,957 --> 00:37:35,487
And you're my future.
you go to London, son.

615
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:37,213
I'll start at Jordan's
next week.

616
00:37:37,245 --> 00:37:40,222
Is this what I stayed for?
To have him hold you back now?

617
00:37:40,255 --> 00:37:42,174
There's nowhere to go
without you.

618
00:37:42,205 --> 00:37:47,071
But will you be happy, Paul?
I-- I want you to be happy.

619
00:37:48,606 --> 00:37:50,240
We'll manage, mother.

620
00:37:51,582 --> 00:37:52,736
Good night.

621
00:38:01,151 --> 00:38:04,160
I've brought thee
a cup of tea, lass.

622
00:38:04,192 --> 00:38:05,824
 You're dressed.
Why didn't you wake me?

623
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:09,824
No cause. It's early yet.

624
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:11,905
Drink it up. It'll pop thee
off to sleep again.

625
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:14,176
I must get Paul his breakfast--
No, no. That's seen to.

626
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,480
Go on. Drink.
Take it.

627
00:38:19,584 --> 00:38:21,537
I'll bet my life
there's no sugar in it.

628
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:24,225
That there is.
There's an extra-big lump, special for thee.

629
00:38:29,345 --> 00:38:31,458
Mother?

630
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:33,390
She's having her rest.
Take your breakfast, lad.

631
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,520
It's ready.

632
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,674
I don't want any.
Now don't be a baby.

633
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:37,846
Take your hands off me.

634
00:38:38,005 --> 00:38:39,746
Paul. Sit down
and eat your breakfast.

635
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:41,921
You don't want to go
upsetting your mother.

636
00:38:41,954 --> 00:38:43,315
You dare say that.

637
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:45,315
Oh, grow up, lad.

638
00:38:45,345 --> 00:38:48,417
It's happened before.
It'll happen again.

639
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:51,106
Your mother and I have
Been together a long time.

640
00:38:51,138 --> 00:38:55,235
We understand, if you don't.
now come on. Sit down.

641
00:38:56,481 --> 00:39:00,962
Come on. Eat it up
and stop being a softie.

642
00:39:09,635 --> 00:39:10,788
There, lad.

643
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:53,813
Excuse me.

644
00:39:53,944 --> 00:39:55,644
Could you tell me where
I could find Mr. Pappleworth?

645
00:39:55,844 --> 00:39:58,437
Spiral department,
Through there.

646
00:39:58,469 --> 00:40:00,455
You the new lad?
Yes.

647
00:40:00,486 --> 00:40:03,334
You're early for Pappleworth.
Anyway, you can wait in there.

648
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:06,566
You might take this corset
frame and give it to my--

649
00:40:06,598 --> 00:40:09,926
The overseer, Mrs. Dawes.

650
00:40:09,957 --> 00:40:11,654
Thanks.
Yes.

651
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,143
If you want to try that on,

652
00:40:31,175 --> 00:40:33,031
There's a room at the back.

653
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,399
Oh, no. Thank you.

654
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:37,927
This is for, uh, Miss Dawes.

655
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:39,656
You mean Mrs. Dawes.

656
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,639
Not that there's any
difference at the moment.

657
00:40:42,951 --> 00:40:45,960
She's just come in.
I'll go and get her.

658
00:40:45,992 --> 00:40:47,496
Thank you.

659

668
00:41:28,874 --> 00:41:32,043
Good morning. We could do
With a bit less noise.

669
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,443
What's this, a complaint?
where does it hurt you?

670
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:36,363
No, sir.

671
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:38,988
Uh, this is for Miss--
Mrs. Dawes.

672
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,908
It was given to me outside.

673
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,083
It must have been Baxter,
Mr. Pappleworth.

674
00:41:43,115 --> 00:41:45,740
Oh, I see.
You're our new lad.

675
00:41:45,772 --> 00:41:47,915
Yes, sir. Paul Morel.
Well, we've lost enough time.

676
00:41:47,947 --> 00:41:49,900
Get your jacket off.
I can see you've met my staff.

677
00:41:49,931 --> 00:41:52,075
Well, we haven't
been introduced.

678
00:41:52,107 --> 00:41:55,532
They talk too much,
but they're a nice lot of girls.

679
00:41:55,564 --> 00:41:58,573
and don't you go and ruin him
like you did the last one.

680
00:41:58,604 --> 00:42:01,069
Polly, May and Emma, trusses.

681
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,149
Connie and Lil,
reinforced corsets.

682
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:05,164
Beatrice, elastic hose.

683
00:42:05,196 --> 00:42:08,525
Fanny, kneecaps.
Lizzie, packer.

684
00:42:08,557 --> 00:42:10,317
Betty, stocking machine.

685
00:42:11,757 --> 00:42:13,613
Oh, and uh, Clara.

686
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:15,853
Clara Dawes,our,overseer.
How do you do?

687
00:42:15,885 --> 00:42:17,901
This is Paul Morel,
our new packer.

688
00:42:17,932 --> 00:42:19,950
Mrs. Dawes, this is for you.
Thank you.

689
00:42:19,981 --> 00:42:21,301
You'll keep Paul busy, eh?

690
00:42:21,481 --> 00:42:22,701
As busy as we're kept.

691
00:42:22,733 --> 00:42:24,750
It's sweated labor here,
Mr. Morel.

692
00:42:24,782 --> 00:42:25,973
The men have seen to that.

693
00:42:26,082 --> 00:42:27,373
Now, Clara,
I've told you before.

694
00:42:27,405 --> 00:42:29,165
You can say what you like
ON that platform of yours,

695
00:42:29,197 --> 00:42:30,958
But we don't want it
at Jordan's.

696
00:42:30,989 --> 00:42:32,943
Clara believes
in women's rights.

697
00:42:32,974 --> 00:42:35,855
You don't find that
amusing, Mr. Morel?

698
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:36,959
Why should I?

699
00:42:36,985 --> 00:42:38,959
Most men do.
They laugh at us.

700
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:41,519
But they're really frightened.
What are we frightened of?

701
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,887
The idea that we're
as good as you are.

702
00:42:46,735 --> 00:42:48,752
Yes?
No, I can't hear.

703
00:42:48,783 --> 00:42:51,502
If the women weren't such fools, 
the men wouldn't be so bad.

704
00:42:51,534 --> 00:42:54,030
Well, whose fault's that?

705
00:42:54,063 --> 00:42:56,240
Now, don't shout.
Oh, be quiet a minute, ladies.

706
00:42:56,272 --> 00:42:59,408
Don't shout. I'm getting an ear-hole
full of dust down here.

707
00:42:59,439 --> 00:43:01,472
All right. I'm coming up.

708
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:03,472
Votes for women.

709
00:43:03,503 --> 00:43:06,384
Well, my lad. Clara will
show you the ropes

710
00:43:06,415 --> 00:43:09,361
Much better than I could,
to her way of thinking.

711
00:43:09,391 --> 00:43:12,272
I'll leave you in the presence
of the sex we're all scared of.

712
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,657
Votes for women.

713
00:43:45,747 --> 00:43:47,890
Hello.

714
00:43:47,922 --> 00:43:52,531
I've torn my sleeve
On a branch.

715
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:54,802
Did you hurt yourself?
No.

716
00:43:54,834 --> 00:43:57,522
How warm you are.

717
00:43:57,555 --> 00:43:59,187
Come inside.
I'll mend it.

718
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:02,708
No. Let's stay out a while.

719
00:44:11,668 --> 00:44:13,525
All right.

720
00:44:16,692 --> 00:44:19,028
There's a sort of
hush tonight.

721
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:24,116
The whole night's
wondering and asleep.

722
00:44:24,149 --> 00:44:26,461
I suppose that's what we do in death--

723
00:45:27,336 --> 00:45:29,336
Sleep in wonder.

724
00:45:32,536 --> 00:45:37,465
We must go.

725
00:45:37,496 --> 00:45:41,049
Yes.

726
00:45:52,985 --> 00:45:54,874
Forgive me.

727
00:45:55,985 --> 00:45:58,874
Forgive you?
I love you.

728
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:04,410
You hated it,
Didn't you?

729
00:46:07,962 --> 00:46:12,059
Paul, i--
I'm sorry.

730
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:22,459
You hated it.

731
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:25,627
You closed your eyes
and clenched your hands.

732
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,923
and I feel like a criminal.

733
00:46:28,955 --> 00:46:31,036
Oh, no.

734
00:46:32,858 --> 00:46:35,290
I did want so much
to give you my love.

735
00:46:35,322 --> 00:46:38,651
To you,it was a sacrifice.

736
00:46:38,683 --> 00:46:41,787
You did it only for me
and not for yourself.

737
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,668
and for you it can't
ever be any way else,

738
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:48,124
Because that's
the way you're made.

739
00:46:48,157 --> 00:46:51,709
To love with the spirit
and only the spirit,like a nun.

740
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,756
It was a crime for me
to persuade you.

741
00:46:59,676 --> 00:47:02,652
I tried to make myself believe
it would bring us closer together.

742
00:47:02,684 --> 00:47:05,694
It has.

743
00:47:05,724 --> 00:47:08,317
Surely it has.

744
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,772
No.

745
00:47:11,804 --> 00:47:13,790
No, it's only pulled us
further apart.

746
00:47:21,374 --> 00:47:25,630
B* silent night b*

747
00:47:25,662 --> 00:47:29,662
B* holy night b*b*

748
00:47:29,693 --> 00:47:32,287
Come on. William and Louisa
will be here soon!

749
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,422
The wind from the scullery blows through
a man's ribs like a five-barred gate.

750
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:38,078
Ha. It'd have some difficulty
blowing through yours.

751
00:47:38,111 --> 00:47:40,672
I'm nothing but a skinned rabbit.
Never was.

752
00:47:40,703 --> 00:47:42,559
A man never
had a better start,

753
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,191
If it was body that counted.

754
00:47:44,222 --> 00:47:45,727
Paul. Paul, you should have
seen your father

755
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,136
When he was your age,

756
00:47:47,167 --> 00:47:48,896
Before the coal dust
had scarred his skin.

757
00:47:48,928 --> 00:47:50,943
A fine figure of a man
your father was,

758
00:47:50,974 --> 00:47:52,543
and such a dancer.

759
00:47:52,576 --> 00:47:54,080
Give me back a bit of a rub,

760
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,585
Will you, lass?

761
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,591
It's as cold as death.

762
00:47:58,624 --> 00:48:00,768
The next world itself
wouldn't be hot enough for you.

763
00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:03,392
Nay, they'll see it's good
and drafty for me.

764
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:05,664
Mother, we're here!
William.

765
00:48:05,695 --> 00:48:09,728
Come on, Paul.
Get your-- go on.

766
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,097
Aaah. Wait, wait, wait.

767
00:48:12,128 --> 00:48:14,944
They'll be waiting to see us.
Come along, quickly.

768
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:18,080
Mother, Louisa.
How do you do?

769
00:48:18,112 --> 00:48:19,425
What a pretty little house.

770
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:21,025
How do you do?
You must be tired.

771
00:48:21,057 --> 00:48:22,080
Hello.

772
00:48:22,257 --> 00:48:23,680
William. Would you like
A nice cup of tea?

773
00:48:23,712 --> 00:48:25,177
Well, we've bought you
some champagne.

774
00:48:25,212 --> 00:48:26,177
Champagne?

775
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:28,224
It's beautifully chilled.
Chilled as we were.

776
00:48:28,257 --> 00:48:30,146
There wasn't any heating
on the train.

777
00:48:30,177 --> 00:48:32,321
This is Paul.

778
00:48:32,352 --> 00:48:34,305
Paul! Louisa.

779
00:48:34,338 --> 00:48:35,994
Hello, Paul. Who's going to open
a bottle of champagne?

780
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:36,994
I will.

781
00:48:37,026 --> 00:48:40,131
I always say Christmas isn't Christmas
without champagne, don't you agree?

782
00:48:40,162 --> 00:48:42,914
It's a 1902 vintage.
Quite a good year, I believe,

783
00:48:42,946 --> 00:48:44,930
Or so the man
At the shop told me.

784
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,763
Not that way.
I don't want a black eye.

785
00:48:46,863 --> 00:48:47,363
Sorry.

786
00:48:47,394 --> 00:48:49,346
Will always says
I don't know anything,

787
00:48:49,378 --> 00:48:51,395
But he didn't know how to open
a bottle of champagne, either,

788
00:48:51,426 --> 00:48:53,602
Before he met me.
Did you, will, dear?

789
00:48:53,635 --> 00:48:55,011
Well, mother,
what do you think of her,

790
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:57,026
Now that you've seen
the rest of her?

791
00:48:57,058 --> 00:48:59,075
Mother was a bit shocked
by your photograph.

792
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:01,347
She called you a naked bust.
I wasn't naked at all.

793
00:49:01,378 --> 00:49:03,203
I was wearing such
a pretty little dress,

794
00:49:03,234 --> 00:49:05,443
But the man who took
the picture cut it all off.

795
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:07,715
Quick, the glasses.

796
00:49:07,747 --> 00:49:09,795
Here.

797
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:14,179
How do, lass?

798
00:49:17,572 --> 00:49:20,005
It's father's bath night.

799
00:49:20,036 --> 00:49:22,373
Paul, put it on a plate.

800
00:49:22,404 --> 00:49:25,028
Oh, let me help you.
Can I help?

801
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,141
Yes, all right.
You can pour it out.

802
00:49:27,171 --> 00:49:29,413
Mother. I know she's not
Like you. She's, uh--

803
00:49:29,444 --> 00:49:31,460
She's not serious.
She can't think.

804
00:49:31,493 --> 00:49:33,572
And everything she wants
costs money.

805
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:35,014
But you do like her,
don't you?

806
00:49:35,104 --> 00:49:36,404
Of course, son.

807
00:49:36,644 --> 00:49:39,654
Champagne's ready.
Will. Will,wait for your father.

808
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,630
Oh, it'll go flat if you
leave it now. There's plenty more.

809
00:49:42,662 --> 00:49:45,158
That'll go flat too if you don't 
put the cork in the bottle.

810
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,941
Happy Christmas.
Happy Christmas.

811
00:49:49,158 --> 00:49:51,910
Will? Mistletoe!
Uh, where?

812
00:49:51,941 --> 00:49:54,918
Over there.
Oh, that's the stuff.

813
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,966
Here you are, love.
Paul?

814
00:49:56,997 --> 00:49:59,847
I don't think we need it.
Come and help me empty the bathtub.

815
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:18,056
They certainly don't need us.

816
00:50:18,087 --> 00:50:20,295
Nor anyone else in the world.

817
00:50:20,328 --> 00:50:22,568
What do you think of her,Mother?
She's pretty enough.

818
00:50:22,599 --> 00:50:25,255
But those blessed airs.
She's so silly.

819
00:50:25,287 --> 00:50:28,135
Can't William see that?
Our William's in love.

820
00:50:28,168 --> 00:50:32,072
At the moment, he's blind.
We'll see how long it lasts.

821
00:50:32,103 --> 00:50:34,824
But, mother,
If she makes him so happy,

822
00:50:34,855 --> 00:50:37,865
Even if it doesn't last,
It's worth it, isn't it?

823
00:50:37,896 --> 00:50:42,537
If you're thinking of Miriam,
son, I've told you before.

824
00:50:42,568 --> 00:50:46,474
She wants your very soul,
and that won't make you happy.

825
00:50:49,289 --> 00:50:52,970
Oh! I thought you were never
going to let me breathe again.

826
00:50:53,001 --> 00:50:55,241
I think that'd be
a very nice way to die.

827
00:50:55,273 --> 00:50:58,985
Louisa, would you like
to see your bedroom?

828
00:50:59,017 --> 00:51:01,161
Thank you!
If I have the breath for the stairs.

829
00:51:01,194 --> 00:51:02,954
Bye, darling.

830
00:51:05,514 --> 00:51:08,843
Isn't she glorious?

831
00:51:08,873 --> 00:51:10,889
Well, isn't she?

832
00:51:10,922 --> 00:51:12,843
Yes, she's beautiful.

833
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:14,699
Hey, what's the matter?

834
00:51:14,731 --> 00:51:16,555
I was just thinking--

835
00:51:16,586 --> 00:51:19,851
Mother and father
felt the same way once.

836
00:51:19,882 --> 00:51:23,243
You're not suggesting we'll
end up like them, are you?

837
00:51:23,274 --> 00:51:25,323
I'm not sure now.

838
00:51:25,355 --> 00:51:30,349
If it's a real passion,
I wonder if it ever dies.

839
00:51:31,979 --> 00:51:33,867
Well, I can only tell you
ours never will.

840
00:51:33,899 --> 00:51:35,499
and that's real enough.

841
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:39,499
And, uh, even if i
lost Louisa tomorrow,

842
00:51:39,532 --> 00:51:42,283
She'd still have
changed my whole life.

843
00:51:42,315 --> 00:51:43,869
Wait till you feel like that about a girl.

844
00:51:43,915 --> 00:51:45,869
Must be marvellous.

845
00:51:45,899 --> 00:51:48,845
I'm so glad
for you, will.

846
00:51:48,876 --> 00:51:50,540
Thanks.

847
00:52:01,133 --> 00:52:03,277
Paul, what is it?

848
00:52:03,308 --> 00:52:05,421
I was always
the silent one,

849
00:52:05,453 --> 00:52:08,142
and now you haven't a word
to say to me.

850
00:52:08,172 --> 00:52:10,733
That's true.

851
00:52:10,765 --> 00:52:12,653
Oh, lovely.

852
00:52:12,685 --> 00:52:17,070
Miriam, I don't think
I should come up here anymore.

853
00:52:19,789 --> 00:52:24,175
Paul, you don't mean that.

854
00:52:24,206 --> 00:52:27,342
You can't mean it.
We've been friends for so long.

855
00:52:27,373 --> 00:52:30,447
Yes, but we didn't
stop at friendship.

856
00:52:30,478 --> 00:52:32,815
It's my fault,
I know.

857
00:52:32,847 --> 00:52:34,990
But we've got to
face the truth of it.

858
00:52:35,022 --> 00:52:37,358
It didn't get us
anywhere else, did it?

859
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:41,199
We can't go back now, and it seems
we can't go forward either.

860
00:52:41,231 --> 00:52:43,984
So I think we ought to
break it off.

861
00:52:44,015 --> 00:52:46,015
What have they
been saying at home?

862
00:52:46,115 --> 00:52:47,215
It's not that.

863
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,711
Your mother never liked me.
She was always against me.

864
00:52:49,743 --> 00:52:50,828
It's not that.

865
00:52:50,943 --> 00:52:52,528
Isn't it?
You wait and see.

866
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:56,495
You wait till you meet someone
you might love,want to marry.

867
00:52:56,527 --> 00:52:59,440
I don't think I'll ever marry.
Not while she--

868
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:00,721
She what?

869
00:53:01,969 --> 00:53:03,889
No, I won't
try to hurt you,

870
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,393
Because I know.

871
00:53:06,801 --> 00:53:10,513
My mother, in her way,
she made me what I am.

872
00:53:11,888 --> 00:53:14,257
I wanted so much
to love you.

873
00:53:16,624 --> 00:53:18,929
Shall we
see each other again?

874
00:53:20,881 --> 00:53:23,153
No.
Never?

875
00:53:25,329 --> 00:53:28,177
Not for a while.

876
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:31,729
Not until you...
Feel free.

877
00:53:31,761 --> 00:53:37,106
AND you? Will you ever
be allowed to feel free?

878
00:53:38,834 --> 00:53:42,161
I could hate you
for making me love you,

879
00:53:42,193 --> 00:53:44,339
Making me fail you.

880
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:02,228
B* so she said to me, charlie,
If you're one of the crew b*

881
00:54:02,259 --> 00:54:05,620
B* I reckon you're entitled
to see my tattoo b*

882
00:54:05,651 --> 00:54:08,851
B* and that's why I went sailing
down that trip to peru b*

883
00:54:08,883 --> 00:54:12,212
B* on the night
me old lady left town b*

884
00:54:12,244 --> 00:54:15,861
B* on the night
me old lady left town b*

885
00:54:15,892 --> 00:54:18,035
Good, sir.

886
00:54:18,067 --> 00:54:20,692
Come on, will.
Give us one of your recitations.

887
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:22,676
Oh, no.
Come on, will.

888
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:23,772
I've forgotten all that.

889
00:54:23,908 --> 00:54:25,172
That nice one--
Robert Browning.

890
00:54:25,205 --> 00:54:27,189
A bit of Browning.Come on.
All right, then.

891
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,941
In deference to popular request.
Silence now, for our will.

892
00:54:29,972 --> 00:54:32,213
Uh, let's see, uh, yes.
That's it. Right.

893
00:54:32,245 --> 00:54:36,950
Uh, "Home thoughts from the Sea",
By Robert Browning.

894
00:54:36,981 --> 00:54:41,014
Nobly, nobly,
Cape St. Vincent to the--

895
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:42,997
This one isn't supposed
to be funny, dear.

896
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,815
Oh, will, I'm sorry. But i
used to do it at school once.

897
00:54:45,846 --> 00:54:49,270
and I used to say
knobbly, knobbly!

898
00:54:49,302 --> 00:54:50,711
I think we'd better
put it to poltroon.

899
00:54:50,742 --> 00:54:53,206
Where's that elderberry wine?

900
00:54:53,237 --> 00:54:54,966
Here you are, Louisa.

901
00:54:54,999 --> 00:54:57,303
Let's drink to our love
and happiness.

902
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:02,999
Conscience is an ugly word

903
00:55:03,031 --> 00:55:05,432
To those who deny freedom!

904
00:55:05,463 --> 00:55:08,823
But freedom is
what we must have!

905
00:55:08,854 --> 00:55:10,871
There are some who say

906
00:55:10,902 --> 00:55:16,151
If we give women their freedom,
they will cease to be women.

907
00:55:16,182 --> 00:55:18,199
Don't believe it.

908
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:22,904
My friends, just because women are taken
out of the prison of their home

909
00:55:22,936 --> 00:55:25,304
and allowed to take their
rightful place in the world,

910
00:55:25,336 --> 00:55:30,072
Why should that deprive them
of the beauty and grace

911
00:55:30,104 --> 00:55:32,665
and charm of womanhood?

912
00:55:32,697 --> 00:55:38,490
My friends, we will
keep house for men--

913
00:55:40,057 --> 00:55:43,513
We will bear their children,

914
00:55:43,544 --> 00:55:46,264
But not as slaves,

915
00:55:46,297 --> 00:55:50,138
But as is our right,
and we'll fight for it!

916
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:52,249
Any questions?

917
00:55:52,281 --> 00:55:54,489
Why aren't you in church?

918
00:55:54,522 --> 00:55:56,410
I could ask you
the same question.

919
00:55:56,442 --> 00:55:57,594
We went this morning.

920
00:55:57,625 --> 00:55:59,258
Was there a sermon
saying

921
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:01,211
Women like us
won't go to heaven?

922
00:56:01,242 --> 00:56:02,523
Very good, Clara.

923
00:56:02,554 --> 00:56:04,379
I have a question.

924
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:05,595
Fire.

925
00:56:05,626 --> 00:56:07,098
Are you a free lover?

926
00:56:08,507 --> 00:56:11,131
Yes. We want
the four freedoms--

927
00:56:11,161 --> 00:56:14,010
Speech, thought,
opportunity, love.

928
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:15,578
Hear! Hear!

929
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,787
I am not a free lover!

930
00:56:17,819 --> 00:56:20,475
The branch office of our movement
has never recommended it.

931
00:56:20,506 --> 00:56:22,331
The point of view
you have just heard

932
00:56:22,364 --> 00:56:24,284
Is strictly personal.

933
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,691
That will be all for today.

934
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:33,148
I hope I haven't given you
the wrong impression.

935
00:56:33,179 --> 00:56:36,283
Free love is not
the basis of our movement.

936
00:56:36,315 --> 00:56:37,756
If you'll read a leaflet--

937
00:56:37,787 --> 00:56:38,941
I've got one already.

938
00:56:40,796 --> 00:56:42,605
You're not an easy subject.

939
00:56:42,696 --> 00:56:44,605
So I've been told.

940
00:56:44,637 --> 00:56:46,748
Well?

941
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,637
You've made me
too beautiful.

942
00:56:48,669 --> 00:56:50,525
No, you are beautiful.

943
00:56:50,556 --> 00:56:52,380
That's the only important
thing about me, I suppose?

944
00:56:52,413 --> 00:56:54,462
Coming, Clara?
Yes.

945
00:56:54,493 --> 00:56:56,157
I've asked Mrs. Dawes
To take a walk with me.

946
00:56:56,189 --> 00:56:58,428
That is, if the branch
office approves.

947
00:56:58,461 --> 00:57:00,990
Next time,
I'll answer the questions.

948
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:05,118
Why did you say
I was going a walk with you?

949
00:57:05,149 --> 00:57:08,349
Well, if you don't want to,
why didn't you go off with them?

950
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:11,325
Shall we? Along the canal.
It's just like Venice.

951
00:57:27,038 --> 00:57:30,814
That man with Betty--
I've seen him at Jordan's.

952
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:34,399
You've heard the girls talk.
He's my husband.

953
00:57:34,431 --> 00:57:37,600
No, I've only heard
that you made an unhappy marriage.

954
00:57:37,631 --> 00:57:41,312
We've been separated
for two years.

955
00:57:41,344 --> 00:57:44,288
When you married him,
were you in love?

956
00:57:46,112 --> 00:57:48,800
Do you still
care for him?

957
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:50,271
I despise him.

958
00:57:50,303 --> 00:57:52,255
And that's
why you left him?

959
00:57:52,287 --> 00:57:55,552
I left him because
he was unfaithful.

960
00:57:55,584 --> 00:57:57,505
Why do you walk
so quickly?

961
00:57:58,879 --> 00:58:00,865
You'll catch up with me
if you're interested.

962
00:58:00,896 --> 00:58:02,754
Are you, Mr. Morel?

963
00:58:07,552 --> 00:58:10,144
I think so, Mrs. Dawes.

964
00:58:19,842 --> 00:58:21,634
What are you thinking?

965
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,906
I'm thinking how lovely
the snowdrops look.

966
00:58:26,274 --> 00:58:29,155
Don't pick them.
Why not?

967
00:58:29,186 --> 00:58:32,002
They look better growing.
They want to be left.

968
00:58:32,034 --> 00:58:34,723
I like them,
and I want them.

969
00:58:34,755 --> 00:58:36,898
So you take what you want,

970
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,883
And when you're tired of it
you throw it away?

971
00:58:39,938 --> 00:58:41,122
What do you mean by that?

972
00:58:41,154 --> 00:58:43,874
Miriam Leivers.

973
00:58:43,906 --> 00:58:46,596
The girls at Jordan's
know everything.

974
00:58:51,586 --> 00:58:53,122
Do you think badly of me?

975
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,876
Why should I care?

976
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,756
They're so cold.

977
00:59:02,787 --> 00:59:05,155
It's the snow on them.

978
00:59:05,187 --> 00:59:08,389
But if you hold snow
In your hand for a little,it melts.

979
00:59:24,932 --> 00:59:27,588
Well, th-this is
a nice time to come home.

980
00:59:27,621 --> 00:59:30,150
Is father home?
Upstairs and snoring.

981
00:59:30,181 --> 00:59:32,165
That's where you ought to be.

982
00:59:32,181 --> 00:59:34,565
Have you had...
anything to eat?

983
00:59:34,597 --> 00:59:38,534
I had tea in Nottingham
with Clara Dawes...From Jordan's.

984
00:59:38,565 --> 00:59:41,125
Clara Dawes. Now you've
Mentioned Clara Daw--

985
00:59:41,158 --> 00:59:44,039
She's a married woman.

986
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:47,141
She's separated.
That won't stop people talking.

987
00:59:47,173 --> 00:59:49,894
She's a suffragette.
She gets up on platforms

988
00:59:49,927 --> 00:59:52,807
and tells all those hypocrites
what she thinks of them.

989
00:59:52,837 --> 00:59:54,822
So they talk anyway.

990
00:59:54,854 --> 00:59:57,032
She's awfully nice, mother.

991
00:59:57,063 --> 01:00:00,679
She-- she's proud.Not a bit cold,
like you'd think at first.

992
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:03,527
Paul, you're not getting serious
about her?

993
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:05,512
I don't know.

994
01:00:05,544 --> 01:00:07,817
I've asked her out
next week.

995
01:00:09,128 --> 01:00:12,040
It couldn't ever
come to anything, son.

996
01:00:12,071 --> 01:00:13,831
You know it couldn't.

997
01:00:13,863 --> 01:00:15,815
I wonder if anything
ever will.

998
01:01:10,314 --> 01:01:13,195
You've missed
your last train.

999
01:01:14,763 --> 01:01:15,756
I know.

1000
01:01:19,147 --> 01:01:22,123
You'd better stay the night.
I'll sleep with mother.

1001
01:01:24,076 --> 01:01:25,996
What will she say?

1002
01:01:26,028 --> 01:01:29,516
She's probably gone to bed.
she won't mind.

1003
01:01:35,371 --> 01:01:38,541
Oh. What a mess!

1004
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:45,965
Clara!

1005
01:01:47,019 --> 01:01:49,197
Who've you got here?

1006
01:01:49,228 --> 01:01:51,117
It's Paul Morel, mother.

1007
01:01:51,148 --> 01:01:53,453
He's missed his train.
I thought he could stay the night.

1008
01:01:53,485 --> 01:01:56,430
Well, if he's staying here,
he won't have to mind about the work.

1009
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,830
Sit you down. Clara,
get him a glass of stout.

1010
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,685
He looks as if
he could do with one.

1011
01:02:00,716 --> 01:02:03,213
Haven't you ever had
any more color than that?

1012
01:02:03,244 --> 01:02:05,934
I've got a thick skin.
It doesn't show the blood through.

1013
01:02:05,965 --> 01:02:07,141
If you don't like me,
I'll go away again.

1014
01:02:07,165 --> 01:02:08,141
No, no, no.

1015
01:02:08,174 --> 01:02:10,029
Stay as you are. Light a
cigarette if you want to.

1016
01:02:10,061 --> 01:02:11,949
Only don't set fire
to all this lace.

1017
01:02:11,981 --> 01:02:13,902
Thank you.
No need to thank me.

1018
01:02:13,933 --> 01:02:16,206
I'll be glad to smell a bit of smoke
about the house again.

1019
01:02:16,237 --> 01:02:17,774
A house without men in it

1020
01:02:17,806 --> 01:02:19,439
Is like a house without
a fire, to my thinking.

1021
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:20,623
I like a man about,

1022
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:22,319
If he's only something
to snap at.

1023
01:02:22,349 --> 01:02:23,471
Do you like lace work?

1024
01:02:23,501 --> 01:02:25,455
I'm a widow.
I've no choice.

1025
01:02:25,486 --> 01:02:26,702
Must be sweated labor.

1026
01:02:26,733 --> 01:02:29,454
Isn't all woman's work
sweated?

1027
01:02:29,487 --> 01:02:31,536
The men have seen
to that, all right,

1028
01:02:31,567 --> 01:02:33,456
Since we've forced ourselves
into the labor market.

1029
01:02:33,487 --> 01:02:35,727
Now, Clara, you shut up
about the men.

1030
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,104
Don't listen to her.

1031
01:02:37,136 --> 01:02:39,664
She's forever
on this high horse of hers.

1032
01:02:39,695 --> 01:02:41,488
The poor animal's back
so thin and starved,

1033
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,920
It'll cut her in two
one of these days.

1034
01:02:47,983 --> 01:02:50,016
You work at Jordan's?

1035
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:52,016
Yes. Has Clara
Mentioned me to you?

1036
01:02:52,049 --> 01:02:54,543
I know more about you
than you think.

1037
01:02:54,575 --> 01:02:57,328
You've been going
with Miriam Leivers.

1038
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,409
Well, yes.

1039
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,744
I know her family well.

1040
01:03:01,777 --> 01:03:03,137
Nice enough girl,

1041
01:03:03,968 --> 01:03:04,968
But a bit too much above
this world to suit my fancy.

1042
01:03:05,168 --> 01:03:07,632
Yes, she is a bit like that.

1043
01:03:07,664 --> 01:03:09,761
She'll never be satisfied until
she's got wings 

1044
01:03:09,894 --> 01:03:11,594
and
can fly over everybody's head.

1045
01:03:11,794 --> 01:03:13,489
That's her mother's doing.

1046
01:03:13,522 --> 01:03:15,410
If religion
was strong drink,

1047
01:03:15,442 --> 01:03:18,194
They'd never be able
to stand that woman up.

1048
01:03:18,225 --> 01:03:19,986
Why, I'd forgotten
about them.

1049
01:03:20,017 --> 01:03:22,418
Where have they sprung from?
Out of my drawer.

1050
01:03:22,449 --> 01:03:25,042
Bought them for Baxter,
and he wouldn't wear them,would he?

1051
01:03:25,073 --> 01:03:27,089
Said he'd reckon to do
Without trousers in bed.

1052
01:03:27,122 --> 01:03:29,969
Couldn't bear them,
Them pajama things.

1053
01:03:30,002 --> 01:03:31,859
Well,
everyone to his taste.

1054
01:03:31,889 --> 01:03:34,674
Yes, I dare say
they'd suit you.

1055
01:03:34,705 --> 01:03:36,627
Well, you're tired,
I expect.

1056
01:03:36,659 --> 01:03:40,115
No, no. It takes me hours
To settle down after an evening out.

1057
01:03:40,147 --> 01:03:43,252
Let's hope you've got started, then.
It's getting late.

1058
01:03:43,283 --> 01:03:45,812
Are you tired, Clara?

1059
01:03:45,843 --> 01:03:48,436
Not in the least bit.

1060
01:03:48,466 --> 01:03:50,672
Uh, would you care to
have a game of cribbage?

1061
01:03:50,766 --> 01:03:53,172
All right.

1062
01:03:53,203 --> 01:03:55,795
You don't mind, do you,
if we have a game of cards?

1063
01:03:55,827 --> 01:03:58,739
You'll please yourselves,
but it's nigh on midnight.

1064
01:03:58,772 --> 01:04:02,675
Well, a game or so 'll
make us sleepy.

1065
01:04:02,707 --> 01:04:07,028
Would you care to play, uh,
five cards or six cards?

1066
01:04:07,059 --> 01:04:08,980
Doesn't matter.

1067
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:10,285
All right, five.
Shall I deal?

1068
01:04:10,312 --> 01:04:12,285
Thank you.

1069
01:04:39,701 --> 01:04:41,750
It's my crib,
so put a card down.

1070
01:04:58,294 --> 01:04:59,351
Ten.

1071
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:04,751
Twenty.

1072
01:05:04,774 --> 01:05:05,751
Thirty.

1073
01:05:07,512 --> 01:05:09,560
Thirty-one.

1074
01:05:09,591 --> 01:05:12,249
Eight.

1075
01:05:24,247 --> 01:05:25,728
Eight.

1076
01:05:25,947 --> 01:05:27,128
That's two.

1077
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:31,897
Uh, 22, 31.
Really.

1078
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:35,417
I've got, uh,
12 pairs two.

1079
01:05:35,448 --> 01:05:40,378
You've got 15, two,
and a pair's 10.

1080
01:05:40,409 --> 01:05:42,681
Pair of tens is four.

1081
01:06:02,619 --> 01:06:04,731
It's nearly 12:00.

1082
01:06:39,004 --> 01:06:41,182
Turn 'em.

1083
01:06:46,716 --> 01:06:48,356
All right. We'll stop.

1084
01:06:48,416 --> 01:06:49,756
Take your pajama things.
Here's your candle.

1085
01:06:49,789 --> 01:06:51,006
Your room is above this.

1086
01:06:51,136 --> 01:06:52,436
There's only two,
so you can't go wrong.

1087
01:06:52,636 --> 01:06:55,516
Good night, and, uh,
hope you sleep well.

1088
01:06:55,548 --> 01:06:57,293
Thank you, I always do.

1089
01:06:57,548 --> 01:06:59,293
So you ought to,
at your age.

1090
01:07:05,533 --> 01:07:06,630
Good night.

1091
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:08,030
Good night.

1092
01:07:20,031 --> 01:07:22,111
What's keeping you, Clara?

1093
01:07:22,142 --> 01:07:25,150
I'm going to stay down here
For a bit. I feel cold.

1094
01:07:25,182 --> 01:07:27,199
Well, don't be long.

1095
01:07:37,663 --> 01:07:40,128
Clara, I'm going up.

1096
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:42,304
Well, that's
The fire all right.

1097
01:07:42,335 --> 01:07:44,448
I think that's
everything for the night.

1098
01:07:48,384 --> 01:07:51,040
Will you unfasten my dress?

1099
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,449
Now then, Clara,
Aren't you coming up?

1100
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,449
Not yet.

1101
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,392
Be quiet about it
when you do.

1102
01:07:59,424 --> 01:08:02,497
I hate to be woken
out of my beauty sleep.

1103
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:02,215
My hand is cold.

1104
01:10:42,794 --> 01:10:43,915
Sign.

1105
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:48,426
I'm warning you, morel.

1106
01:10:48,458 --> 01:10:50,315
Keep away from my wife,

1107
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:53,355
Or you're going to
have me to settle with.

1108
01:10:56,521 --> 01:10:58,027
Take your receipt.

1109
01:11:06,154 --> 01:11:09,451
Get back to your work, girls.
Stop this chattering.

1110
01:11:13,707 --> 01:11:17,740
Baxter's dangerous.
Could you fight him?

1111
01:11:17,771 --> 01:11:22,156
Easily, with a knife
or a pistol.

1112
01:11:22,188 --> 01:11:25,804
It's no joke. He'd kill you.

1113
01:11:25,836 --> 01:11:29,164
And what would you do if he did?
would you go back to him?

1114
01:11:33,515 --> 01:11:36,493
I have a few days off
Next week.

1115
01:11:36,524 --> 01:11:40,717
Let's go away together.
We'd be by ourselves.

1116
01:11:41,709 --> 01:11:44,013
We could go to the sea.

1117
01:11:44,044 --> 01:11:46,477
There'd be nobody there
In winter.

1118
01:11:46,509 --> 01:11:49,101
Mr. Pappleworth wants Paul
To take an order.

1119
01:11:49,133 --> 01:11:51,310
If you're too busy,
I can do it.

1120
01:11:51,342 --> 01:11:53,806
No, that's all right,
I'll go.

1121
01:12:04,461 --> 01:12:06,446
Well, aren't you going to say it?
Say what?

1122
01:12:06,478 --> 01:12:08,431
"you didn't come home
last night, Paul."

1123
01:12:08,462 --> 01:12:10,511
You didn't come home
last night, Paul.

1124
01:12:10,542 --> 01:12:13,647
Mother, it is serious.

1125
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:17,071
It can't be, son.
A woman you can't ever hope to marry.

1126
01:12:17,102 --> 01:12:19,087
I haven't mentioned marriage.

1127
01:12:19,118 --> 01:12:21,359
It's a very different
thing from love.

1128
01:12:21,391 --> 01:12:23,407
In marriage,
one has to belong,

1129
01:12:23,438 --> 01:12:25,230
and I can't ever
belong to any woman.

1130
01:12:25,262 --> 01:12:27,376
That's because you haven't
met the right one.

1131
01:12:27,408 --> 01:12:29,052
I shan't find the right one
as long as you live.

1132
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:30,352
I'll get your supper.

1133
01:12:30,383 --> 01:12:32,463
You're the only one
I'll ever be certain about.

1134
01:12:32,495 --> 01:12:34,257
But I can't think of you
going through your life

1135
01:12:34,288 --> 01:12:37,264
With no one
to care for you. To--

1136
01:12:37,295 --> 01:12:39,631
What's the matter?
Nothing.

1137
01:12:39,663 --> 01:12:42,929
Are you not well?
It's nothing!

1138
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:44,945
I'm growing old,
that's all.

1139
01:12:46,032 --> 01:12:47,504
Well, that's too bad of you.

1140
01:12:47,535 --> 01:12:49,296
Why can't a man always
Have a young mother?

1141
01:12:49,329 --> 01:12:51,090
I'm growing old,

1142
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,521
and you'll just have to
get used to it, that's all.

1143
01:13:11,281 --> 01:13:12,721
This man, Baxter Dawes,

1144
01:13:12,754 --> 01:13:15,635
Comes up to me in the pub--
Everyone's listenin'--

1145
01:13:15,666 --> 01:13:17,618
and says, "keep your son
away from my wife."

1146
01:13:17,649 --> 01:13:20,498
How do you like that?
"Keep your son away from my wife!"

1147
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:22,227
It's too late.

1148
01:13:22,258 --> 01:13:25,107
They've gone away
together on a holiday.

1149
01:13:27,123 --> 01:13:30,548
He told you,
and you let him?

1150
01:13:30,579 --> 01:13:32,820
You stupid fool! Do you think
I didn't try and stop him?

1151
01:13:32,851 --> 01:13:34,802
How dare you?
You, of all people,

1152
01:13:34,835 --> 01:13:36,756
Tell me what's right
and what's wrong!

1153
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:39,412
All these years,
you've been the fine lady,

1154
01:13:39,442 --> 01:13:41,715
and I've been the lump of dirt.
And whose fault's that?

1155
01:13:41,747 --> 01:13:44,404
I've never encouraged a son of mine
to run after a married woman!

1156
01:13:44,434 --> 01:13:47,443
and what was I supposed to do?
Keep him in chains?

1157
01:13:47,475 --> 01:13:49,683
You could have done
if you'd been so minded.

1158
01:13:49,715 --> 01:13:51,765
You've kept him in chains
all his life.

1159
01:13:51,795 --> 01:13:54,163
Don't you talk to me about
the way I've looked after our sons--

1160
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:56,469
You who never did a thing
for them, but drag them down!

1161
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,388
Better for 'em if I had.
You had you way with Arthur.

1162
01:13:58,420 --> 01:13:59,540
What happened to him?

1163
01:13:59,572 --> 01:14:01,461
Arthur died young,
but he died a man.

1164
01:14:01,493 --> 01:14:03,541
And William, he's had the good
 sense to escape from you.

1165
01:14:03,573 --> 01:14:05,589
From you with your drunken ways.
No, woman, no!

1166
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:07,668
You're the one
he had to escape from!

1167
01:14:07,701 --> 01:14:10,358
He had to find a life of his own,
where you wouldn't smother him

1168
01:14:10,389 --> 01:14:11,374
As you've
Smothered this one.

1169
01:14:11,389 --> 01:14:12,374
Walter--

1170
01:14:12,405 --> 01:14:14,358
It's your fault the lad's
in this trouble now.

1171
01:14:14,389 --> 01:14:16,597
It's your fault!
Don't try and fix the blame on me!

1172
01:14:16,628 --> 01:14:19,477
Why do you think he's gallivanting
'round with a Nottingham tart?

1173
01:14:19,509 --> 01:14:21,365
He's never had
the chance to go courtin'

1174
01:14:21,398 --> 01:14:22,678
With an ordinary
decent girl.

1175
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:24,533
You put a stop
to anything like that.

1176
01:14:24,566 --> 01:14:27,222
You, with your pride
and your jealousy.

1177
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:30,519
Any lad of spirit can throw off
a-a low mannered father.

1178
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:32,630
That's not going to hold him up
when he grows up.

1179
01:14:32,662 --> 01:14:35,190
But a mother, a mother
who clings on to him

1180
01:14:35,222 --> 01:14:36,854
and won't let him
go for her own selfish sake,

1181
01:14:36,885 --> 01:14:38,742
That's enough
to ruin his life.

1182
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:41,238
and that's what you've done
to our Paul!

1183
01:14:45,079 --> 01:14:50,743
I only wanted him to be happy.

1184
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:27,897
Mmm.

1185
01:15:30,713 --> 01:15:32,698
Mmm.

1186
01:15:32,729 --> 01:15:34,746
I feel so simple with you,

1187
01:15:34,777 --> 01:15:37,465
As though there's
nothing to hide.

1188
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:42,971
You don't feel criminal,
do you?

1189
01:15:43,002 --> 01:15:45,082
No.

1190
01:15:45,113 --> 01:15:47,866
I was just thinking.

1191
01:15:47,897 --> 01:15:50,683
What?
If only they knew.

1192
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:53,146
Who?
Everybody.

1193
01:15:53,178 --> 01:15:57,114
If they knew, they'd
cease to understand.

1194
01:15:57,146 --> 01:15:59,290
What do they matter,
anyway?

1195
01:15:59,323 --> 01:16:00,884
With only us here
and these trees.

1196
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:01,884
What trees?

1197
01:16:01,915 --> 01:16:04,315
Nothing matters.
These trees-- These iron ones.

1198
01:16:11,131 --> 01:16:12,443
Baxter?

1199
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,900
You like your little bit
of guiltiness, I think.

1200
01:16:21,117 --> 01:16:23,420
I believe Eve
must have enjoyed it

1201
01:16:23,451 --> 01:16:26,268
When she went
Cowering out of paradise.

1202
01:16:26,299 --> 01:16:30,204
There's Baxter,
and there's Miriam.

1203
01:16:33,469 --> 01:16:37,276
Miriam wanted more from me
Than I could ever give her.

1204
01:16:37,308 --> 01:16:39,036
She wouldn't leave
a single hair of me free

1205
01:16:39,068 --> 01:16:40,894
To fall out and blow away.

1206
01:16:40,925 --> 01:16:43,197
She'd insist on keeping it.

1207
01:16:43,228 --> 01:16:45,917
She wanted the soul
out of my body.

1208
01:16:45,948 --> 01:16:49,309
So you put a limit
on the claims of love?

1209
01:16:49,342 --> 01:16:52,221
Now you sound like
you're back on your platform.

1210
01:16:52,253 --> 01:16:55,582
And what about you?
Did you give Baxter all he wanted?

1211
01:17:01,087 --> 01:17:02,943
I gave him every chance.

1212
01:17:02,974 --> 01:17:06,624
To get near you, really near you, so you
Belonged to each other?

1213
01:17:09,021 --> 01:17:11,711
It seems to me
you treated Baxter rottenly.

1214
01:17:11,743 --> 01:17:13,535
You wanted him to be
a lily of the valley,

1215
01:17:13,567 --> 01:17:15,136
and when you found out
he wasn't

1216
01:17:15,166 --> 01:17:17,472
He was a cow parsley,
you wouldn't have it.

1217
01:17:17,503 --> 01:17:20,949
You imagined him something he wasn't,
which is just like a woman.

1218
01:17:21,022 --> 01:17:23,079
She thinks she knows what
a man needs, 

1219
01:17:23,112 --> 01:17:24,312
and she's going
to see that he gets it.

1220
01:17:24,512 --> 01:17:26,336
He can be starving for what
he really needs,

1221
01:17:26,366 --> 01:17:28,191
and she'll have him sit
and whistle for it,

1222
01:17:28,223 --> 01:17:30,433
So long as she's giving him
what's good for him.

1223
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:44,001
and what are you doing?

1224
01:17:44,032 --> 01:17:46,464
I'm waiting to see
what tune I shall whistle.

1225
01:17:50,048 --> 01:17:52,737
Do you ever want
to marry me?

1226
01:17:52,769 --> 01:17:54,720
Do you, me?

1227
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:57,058
Yes, I should like us
to have children.

1228
01:18:00,002 --> 01:18:03,553
But you don't really want
a divorce from Baxter,do you?

1229
01:18:03,586 --> 01:18:06,562
No, I don't think so.
Why?

1230
01:18:08,258 --> 01:18:10,050
I don't know.

1231
01:18:12,001 --> 01:18:14,851
Do you feel
you belong to him?

1232
01:18:14,881 --> 01:18:16,294
No.

1233
01:18:16,581 --> 01:18:17,794
What, then?

1234
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:23,587
I think
he belongs to me.

1235
01:18:25,825 --> 01:18:29,475
Let's take what we've got
and be grateful.

1236
01:18:58,116 --> 01:19:00,388
Don't I exist for you
This morning?

1237
01:19:02,981 --> 01:19:05,125
I shouldn't think you'd need
reassurance about that.

1238
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:07,653
I wonder.

1239
01:19:09,892 --> 01:19:13,637
About me you know very little.
About me.

1240
01:19:14,629 --> 01:19:16,581
What do you mean?

1241
01:19:16,613 --> 01:19:20,263
I never seem
to have all of you.

1242
01:19:20,293 --> 01:19:22,982
It's as though you were taking
someone else.

1243
01:19:23,014 --> 01:19:25,190
Who?

1244
01:19:26,309 --> 01:19:29,158
Someone just for yourself.

1245
01:19:29,190 --> 01:19:32,711
Is it me you want?
Or just it?

1246
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:38,374
Have you ever been loved
more than I've loved you?

1247
01:19:41,766 --> 01:19:44,423
It isn't the act of loving.

1248
01:19:44,454 --> 01:19:48,103
It's just that you seem
incapable of giving yourself.

1249
01:19:49,896 --> 01:19:52,584
It's as though something
were holding you back.

1250
01:19:54,727 --> 01:19:56,712
Or somebody.

1251
01:20:02,632 --> 01:20:04,648
Tell me. Who?

1252
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:07,080
Didn't Miriam ever tell you?

1253
01:20:07,112 --> 01:20:09,097
Shut up, Clara.

1254
01:20:09,128 --> 01:20:11,337
Why can't you
come out of yourself?

1255
01:20:11,369 --> 01:20:14,825
Shut up!
You don't, you know.

1256
01:20:14,857 --> 01:20:17,225
Baxter could.

1257
01:20:17,256 --> 01:20:20,008
Better than me?
Yes.

1258
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,633
You begin to value Baxter,
now you haven't got him.

1259
01:20:22,664 --> 01:20:24,744
I'm only noticing that
he was different from you.

1260
01:20:24,777 --> 01:20:26,346
Better, you said!

1261
01:20:26,377 --> 01:20:28,105
So. I'm not saying

1262
01:20:28,137 --> 01:20:30,954
That you haven't given me
more than Baxter ever has.

1263
01:20:30,986 --> 01:20:33,162
Or could ever give you.

1264
01:20:33,193 --> 01:20:35,178
Perhaps.

1265
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:38,027
But when I had Baxter,

1266
01:20:38,058 --> 01:20:39,274
Actually had him.

1267
01:20:39,306 --> 01:20:40,939
I had all of him.

1268
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:43,658
But you've
never given me yourself.

1269
01:20:49,707 --> 01:20:51,179
When I start
making love to you,

1270
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:55,274
I just go like a leaf
down the wind.

1271
01:20:55,307 --> 01:20:57,836
and leave me out of it.

1272
01:20:57,868 --> 01:21:00,331
Then it doesn't
mean anything to you.

1273
01:21:00,363 --> 01:21:02,924
Of course it means something.

1274
01:21:02,955 --> 01:21:05,770
Sometimes
you've carried me away...

1275
01:21:05,802 --> 01:21:07,852
Right away.

1276
01:21:09,483 --> 01:21:11,659
But--
Don't "but" me!

1277
01:21:46,477 --> 01:21:49,071
Good night.
Good night.

1278
01:22:10,063 --> 01:22:13,871
Morel! You gonna fight?
or take it lying down?

1279
01:22:13,903 --> 01:22:15,631
Let me pass.

1280
01:23:18,738 --> 01:23:20,946
Mother!

1281
01:23:20,978 --> 01:23:22,355
I'm up here.

1282
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:33,011
Mother, are you ill?

1283
01:23:33,043 --> 01:23:35,540
I'm giving myself
a bit of a treat.

1284
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:38,260
Paul, what have you done
to your face?

1285
01:23:38,292 --> 01:23:41,045
I-- I just had
A fall off my bicycle.

1286
01:23:41,075 --> 01:23:44,435
I've never known you to be in bed at this time.
It's early. Tell me the truth.

1287
01:23:44,467 --> 01:23:47,253
I'm a bit tired, that's all.
I've been to Nottingham.

1288
01:23:47,285 --> 01:23:49,365
To Nottingham.
All by yourself?

1289
01:23:49,396 --> 01:23:51,124
Well, when you're my age,

1290
01:23:51,156 --> 01:23:53,908
It's just as well to see
a doctor once in a while.

1291
01:23:53,941 --> 01:23:55,397
Paul, you have hurt yourself.

1292
01:23:55,941 --> 01:23:57,397
Oh, mother, it's--
it's nothing.

1293
01:23:57,428 --> 01:23:58,821
Uh, what did the doctor say?

1294
01:23:58,828 --> 01:24:00,821
I've got to
take things quietly.

1295
01:24:00,853 --> 01:24:03,285
and he's given me
a bottle of medicine.

1296
01:24:03,316 --> 01:24:06,260
Have, uh,
you been happy, son?

1297
01:24:06,292 --> 01:24:07,845
Yes, mother.

1298
01:24:07,992 --> 01:24:09,845
Well, you'll be
wanting your supper.

1299
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:12,021
Oh, don't you dare move.
I can look after myself.

1300
01:24:12,053 --> 01:24:14,070
Have you eaten tonight?
I've had all I want.

1301
01:24:14,101 --> 01:24:16,086
Now, there's some eggs
in the larder--

1302
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:18,231
I'll find something.
I'll find something.

1303
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:20,022
Now are-- you are
telling me the truth?

1304
01:24:20,053 --> 01:24:21,815
There's nothing else to tell.

1305
01:24:21,846 --> 01:24:24,439
Now, go and wash that face
before it gets septic.

1306
01:24:24,471 --> 01:24:26,679
Don't you worry about me.

1307
01:24:43,063 --> 01:24:45,112
More tea?
No.

1308
01:24:45,143 --> 01:24:47,351
Miss Dawes.

1309
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:48,891
There's a message for you.

1310
01:24:48,982 --> 01:24:49,591
Oh, thank you.

1311
01:24:49,624 --> 01:24:51,672
Mrs. Dawes.

1312
01:24:58,008 --> 01:25:00,217
It's Baxter.
He's been hurt.

1313
01:25:00,248 --> 01:25:01,848
I must go to him.

1314
01:25:03,384 --> 01:25:06,680
He's alone. There's
no one to look after him.

1315
01:25:11,513 --> 01:25:13,562
Wait.

1316
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:23,514
Goodbye, Clara.

1317
01:25:23,545 --> 01:25:25,689
Paul.

1318
01:25:25,721 --> 01:25:29,179
It is Baxter, isn't it?
All the time.

1319
01:25:30,138 --> 01:25:34,490
Yes. You see
How weak I am?

1320
01:25:36,474 --> 01:25:38,715
I need to be loved too.

1321
01:25:40,697 --> 01:25:43,002
No, Paul.

1322
01:25:43,035 --> 01:25:48,795
Let's say good bye, before
we start accusing each other

1323
01:25:48,827 --> 01:25:51,995
and losing everything
We've ever had.

1324
01:25:52,026 --> 01:25:56,411
We'll never lose it.
We've paid for it.

1325
01:26:02,235 --> 01:26:05,116
I beg your pardon,
I'm sure.

1326
01:26:06,588 --> 01:26:08,285
Betty,
I have to go out now.

1327
01:26:08,316 --> 01:26:10,459
Please take charge.

1328
01:26:10,492 --> 01:26:12,701
It'll be
a pleasure.

1329
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:25,469
Oh, have I come
to the wrong house?

1330
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:28,157
Your wife's poorly.
She's had another of them turns.

1331
01:26:28,189 --> 01:26:31,966
Oh? Fainting fit?

1332
01:26:31,996 --> 01:26:35,549
I reckon it's worse than that.
The doctor's up there now.

1333
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,789
Is that for me?

1334
01:26:37,822 --> 01:26:40,670
Yes. She was anxious
about your tea.

1335
01:26:40,701 --> 01:26:42,590
I like my potatoes cut up.

1336
01:26:42,622 --> 01:26:44,478
You'll take 'em
as you get 'em.

1337
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:47,422
Here he comes now.

1338
01:26:47,453 --> 01:26:49,759
Good evening, Morel.
Is she bad?

1339
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:52,287
I'm afraid it's rather serious.
Heart attack, you know.

1340
01:26:52,318 --> 01:26:55,294
May have another.
We've got to keep her very quiet.

1341
01:26:55,326 --> 01:26:56,779
I'd best go up.

1342
01:26:56,926 --> 01:26:58,079
Can you stay the night
with her?

1343
01:26:58,110 --> 01:27:00,190
I'll go and get my man his tea
when the boy comes home,

1344
01:27:00,222 --> 01:27:01,727
and I'll be right back.

1345
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:03,615
Any change, send the lad
For me at once.

1346
01:27:03,646 --> 01:27:05,727
It'll be touch and go
if she has another attack.

1347
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:12,671
Well, you're a fine one.

1348
01:27:15,455 --> 01:27:17,471
How do I find thee, lass?

1349
01:27:17,502 --> 01:27:21,312
I'm middling.
Just middling.

1350
01:27:22,879 --> 01:27:24,929
Is she looking after you
All right?

1351
01:27:24,959 --> 01:27:27,167
Aye.

1352
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:29,600
She don't cut up
the potatoes!

1353
01:27:33,088 --> 01:27:35,329
You'll have to
make allowances.

1354
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,313
Aye.

1355
01:27:44,385 --> 01:27:45,802
Is that Paul home?

1356
01:27:45,885 --> 01:27:47,202
He'll be coming up.

1357
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:52,866
Lass, I've--I've said some 
hardthings in my time.

1358
01:27:52,898 --> 01:27:55,234
I-I didn't mean 'em,
you know that.

1359
01:27:55,266 --> 01:27:58,403
We don't want to think
about those things now.

1360
01:28:06,625 --> 01:28:08,078
Mother.

1361
01:28:08,125 --> 01:28:09,378
Now, now, don't fret.

1362
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:11,363
Why didn't you tell me?
Tell you what?

1363
01:28:11,395 --> 01:28:15,075
About these attacks.
I met Dr Ansell outside.

1364
01:28:15,107 --> 01:28:17,123
Oh, my pigeon,
why didn't you tell me?

1365
01:28:17,154 --> 01:28:19,522
There's no sense in fussing.

1366
01:28:19,555 --> 01:28:21,411
We're going to get you better.

1367
01:28:21,443 --> 01:28:22,947
Father and I can
look after ourselves.

1368
01:28:22,978 --> 01:28:25,540
and we'll see that you
get a nice long rest.

1369
01:28:25,571 --> 01:28:27,332
The cold weather
Will soon be over,

1370
01:28:27,364 --> 01:28:30,020
Once we have the spring
sunshine.

1371
01:28:30,051 --> 01:28:33,411
I wish it was spring now.

1372
01:28:33,443 --> 01:28:35,812
I'd like to
see the daffodils.

1373
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:38,340
Oh, you shall.
I promise you.

1374
01:28:41,956 --> 01:28:43,653
You-- you go, son.

1375
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:47,221
I'd like to get some sleep.

1376
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:49,221
Yes. You sleep.

1377
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:57,637
Paul.
Yes, mother?

1378
01:28:57,669 --> 01:29:00,741
I don't want your father
to see me anymore.

1379
01:29:02,852 --> 01:29:04,741
I want to think
of the happy times

1380
01:29:04,773 --> 01:29:07,590
When he was brave and laughing.

1381
01:29:07,622 --> 01:29:11,942
When he comes in now, I only
think of the other things,

1382
01:29:11,973 --> 01:29:14,695
the hateful things and I can't bear
to look at him.

1383
01:29:16,805 --> 01:29:18,982
Do you think
That's hard of me?

1384
01:29:19,015 --> 01:29:21,575
Perhaps when
You're a little better.

1385
01:29:21,605 --> 01:29:24,999
No. I won't be better.

1386
01:29:26,822 --> 01:29:28,807
We mustn't pretend
Anymore, son.

1387
01:29:30,215 --> 01:29:33,064
It'll only make us
Afraid of each other.

1388
01:29:37,767 --> 01:29:38,773
Good night.

1389
01:29:38,967 --> 01:29:40,073
Good night, my love.

1390
01:30:33,417 --> 01:30:35,531
Paul, come quick!

1391
01:30:44,234 --> 01:30:45,452
Mother.

1392
01:30:55,178 --> 01:30:59,500
Look, mother. Mother?

1393
01:30:59,531 --> 01:31:03,212
I've done your daffodils.
Mother, look.

1394
01:31:10,763 --> 01:31:12,749
No! Don't!

1395
01:31:15,212 --> 01:31:18,156
Mother.

1396
01:31:23,852 --> 01:31:26,061
I've done your daffodils.

1397
01:31:26,094 --> 01:31:28,110
Mother.

1398
01:31:48,783 --> 01:31:50,063
How is she, lad?

1399
01:31:51,438 --> 01:31:54,095
Didn't you notice
the curtains were drawn?

1400
01:32:06,094 --> 01:32:07,472
When did she go?

1401
01:32:08,944 --> 01:32:11,120
You'd only just left.

1402
01:32:13,327 --> 01:32:16,143
Don't you want to see her?
No.

1403
01:32:16,175 --> 01:32:18,736
She didn't want me
with her anymore.

1404
01:32:21,135 --> 01:32:23,536
Well, you can
go to London now, son.

1405
01:32:25,296 --> 01:32:28,368
You still want to go
there, don't you?

1406
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,449
I don't know
what I want.

1407
01:32:32,529 --> 01:32:35,282
At the moment,
I feel I want to go after her.

1408
01:32:35,312 --> 01:32:38,224
Now, don't you
let her down.

1409
01:32:38,257 --> 01:32:41,842
Your mother
believed in me once, but--

1410
01:32:41,872 --> 01:32:44,466
Well, I don't know.
I suppose I let things slide.

1411
01:32:44,497 --> 01:32:47,441
You're the one
To set things right again.

1412
01:32:47,473 --> 01:32:49,394
How, father?

1413
01:32:49,424 --> 01:32:53,489
By not letting things slide,
As I did.

1414
01:32:53,522 --> 01:32:58,867
If only you could settle your life 
without all this... searching.

1415
01:33:00,146 --> 01:33:03,667
I reckon it'll be
Much better for you.

1416
01:33:03,699 --> 01:33:05,779
Don't you mean easier?

1417
01:33:08,594 --> 01:33:11,026
That's Miriam's doctrine
For life--

1418
01:33:11,059 --> 01:33:15,571
Ease of soul and physical comfort.
and I despise it.

1419
01:33:15,603 --> 01:33:18,388
You do, do you?
Well, I can't think why.

1420
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:20,404
All this cleverness of yours,

1421
01:33:20,436 --> 01:33:23,251
This taking your life
Into your own hands,

1422
01:33:23,283 --> 01:33:26,004
It don't seem to have
Brought thee much happiness,

1423
01:33:26,036 --> 01:33:27,931
Happiness.

1424
01:33:28,036 --> 01:33:30,931
If only you could meet some good
Woman who could make you happy.

1425
01:33:30,964 --> 01:33:33,141
Damn your happiness.

1426
01:33:33,171 --> 01:33:35,508
So long as life is full,

1427
01:33:35,539 --> 01:33:38,325
That's all I've ever wanted.

1428
01:33:38,355 --> 01:33:41,172
and now it's empty
because she's dead.

1429
01:33:42,804 --> 01:33:46,005
Oh, she's dead.

1430
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:49,814
I know. I know. So is Arthur.

1431
01:33:49,844 --> 01:33:51,317
and the dead don't come back,

1432
01:33:51,349 --> 01:33:55,509
But it doesn't mean you can
let them down, does it?

1433
01:33:55,541 --> 01:33:58,869
They can still look on,
can't they? Or so we're told.

1434
01:33:59,893 --> 01:34:02,806
Maybe they can
help us sometimes.

1435
01:34:04,564 --> 01:34:07,510
Let's see if that woman's
Got our grub for us.

1436
01:34:26,263 --> 01:34:27,320
Paul!

1437
01:34:33,911 --> 01:34:36,855
Hello, Miriam.

1438
01:34:36,887 --> 01:34:40,856
I heard, Paul.
I'm so sorry.

1439
01:34:43,031 --> 01:34:46,776
All those years of
bitterness and struggle.

1440
01:34:51,607 --> 01:34:53,592
and illness and death.

1441
01:34:55,032 --> 01:34:57,048
I don't know
what it was all for.

1442
01:34:57,081 --> 01:35:01,368
For you. You're alive.

1443
01:35:01,399 --> 01:35:03,198
Why should I live?

1444
01:35:03,399 --> 01:35:04,698
For her.

1445
01:35:04,729 --> 01:35:07,129
You've got to
Go on living for her sake.

1446
01:35:07,161 --> 01:35:08,794
Go on with your painting.

1447
01:35:08,826 --> 01:35:11,322
She wanted that.
Painting's not living.

1448
01:35:11,353 --> 01:35:14,649
Then be happy just to live.

1449
01:35:14,681 --> 01:35:17,721
We should all give
ourselves that chance.

1450
01:35:17,754 --> 01:35:19,675
I'm taking mine tomorrow.

1451
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:23,930
Are you going away?

1452
01:35:23,962 --> 01:35:26,970
I'm going to train to
Be a teacher in London.

1453
01:35:27,961 --> 01:35:30,202
Do you plan
To go there now?

1454
01:35:31,707 --> 01:35:34,011
Yes, I suppose so.

1455
01:35:35,386 --> 01:35:37,947
Have you broken off
with clara Dawes?

1456
01:35:39,835 --> 01:35:42,684
Well, she's broken off with me.

1457
01:35:42,715 --> 01:35:45,276
She knew it wouldn't last.

1458
01:35:45,307 --> 01:35:48,219
You know, I think
we should be married.

1459
01:35:49,914 --> 01:35:51,964
Why?

1460
01:35:54,267 --> 01:35:58,461
If only to keep you
From wasting yourself.

1461
01:35:58,491 --> 01:36:00,749
You might get ill.

1462
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:02,580
Anything might happen,
and I'd never know.

1463
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:04,732
Would knowing prevent it?

1464
01:36:04,763 --> 01:36:07,196
At least I could stop you

1465
01:36:07,229 --> 01:36:09,437
From being a prey
To women like Clara.

1466
01:36:13,244 --> 01:36:16,093
You'd want nothing
For yourself?

1467
01:36:16,125 --> 01:36:18,622
Dear, lovely Miriam.

1468
01:36:20,189 --> 01:36:22,878
I don't think marriage
Would be any good.

1469
01:36:24,476 --> 01:36:25,918
I only think of you.

1470
01:36:26,749 --> 01:36:28,574
I know you do.

1471
01:36:30,748 --> 01:36:33,342
You want to put me
in your pocket,

1472
01:36:33,373 --> 01:36:35,966
and I should die there,
Smothered.

1473
01:36:35,998 --> 01:36:38,975
We belong to each other.

1474
01:36:39,006 --> 01:36:41,567
You said that yourself once.

1475
01:36:44,510 --> 01:36:46,431
I was wrong.

1476
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:52,576
I did belong to my mother.
But now she's dead,

1477
01:36:52,606 --> 01:36:54,720
and I don't want her
to live again in you.

1478
01:36:56,703 --> 01:36:58,560
Not even in you, Miriam.

1479
01:37:00,830 --> 01:37:04,351
I'm sure I'll never find
anyone as good as you...

1480
01:37:04,384 --> 01:37:07,871
Or any love as good as yours,

1481
01:37:07,904 --> 01:37:13,217
But I don't want to find it,
because I want to be free.

1482
01:37:14,815 --> 01:37:17,072
I don't ever want to
belong to anyone again.

1483
01:37:18,472 --> 01:37:20,472
Never anymore.

1484
01:37:20,672 --> 01:37:24,769
and, perhaps,I'll understand at last
what it means to live.

1485
01:37:28,225 --> 01:37:30,018
Good bye.
