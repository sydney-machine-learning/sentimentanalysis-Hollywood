00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,157
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

334
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:57,491
You know, you're the only one around here
who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.

335
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,496
- Really?
- The characters you meet.

336
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,124
Something happens to men in elevators.
Must be the change of altitude.

337
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,827
The blood rushes to their head
or something.

338
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,928
- Boy, I could tell you stories...
- I'd love to hear them.

339
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,667
Maybe we could have lunch
in the cafeteria sometime

340
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,039
or some evening after work.

341
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,702
- Twenty-seven.
- Oh.

342
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,874
- I hope everything goes all right.
- I hope so.

343
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,711
Wouldn't you know
they'd call me on a day like this,

344
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,944
what with a cold and every...
How do I look?

345
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,452
Fine. Wait.

346
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,754
Thank you.

347
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,586
You know, that's the first thing
I ever noticed about you

348
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:29,718
when you were still on the local elevator
you always wore a flower.

349
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,422
Good luck, and wipe your nose.

350
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,637
C.C. Baxter,
Ordinary Premium Accounting.

351
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,478
- Mr. Sheldrake called me.
- I called you.

352
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,576
That is, I tried to call you for 20 minutes.

353
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,712
- I'm sorry. I...
- Go on in.

354
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,027
- Baxter?
- Yes, sir.

355
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,728
Come in. Come in.

356
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:16,073
I was sort of wondering
what you looked like, Baxter.

357
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,405
- Sit down.
- Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.

358
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:22,978
Been hearing some nice things about you.

359
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,379
Have a report here from Mr. Dobisch.

360
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,110
Says you're Ioyal,
cooperative, resourceful...

361
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,412
Mr. Dobisch said that?

362
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,817
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me
that several nights a week,

363
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,685
you work late at the office
without overtime.

364
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,247
You know how it is. Things pile up.

365
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,383
Mr. Vanderhoff in Public Relations

366
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,292
and Mr. Eichelberger
in Mortgage and Loans.

367
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,423
They both would like to have you
transferred to their departments.

368
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,160
Very flattering.

369
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:48,434
Tell me, Baxter,
just what is it that makes you so popular?

370
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,607
I don't know.

371
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:51,801
Think.

372
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,707
Would you mind repeating the question?

373
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,877
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid.

374
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,818
I know everything
that goes on in this building,

375
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,686
in every department, on every floor,
every day of the year.

376
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,020
You do?

377
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,926
In 1957, we had an employee here,
name of Fowler.

378
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,623
He was very popular, too.

379
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,530
It turned out he was running a bookie joint
right in the Actuarial department,

380
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,828
tying up our switchboards,

381
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:19,062
using our IBM Machines
to figure the odds.

382
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,469
So the day before the Kentucky Derby,
I called in the vice squad,

383
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,564
and we raided the thirteenth floor.

384
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,269
- The vice squad?
- That's right.

385
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:29,177
What's that got to do with me?
I'm not running any bookie joint.

386
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,477
Just what kind of a joint are you running?

387
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:32,709
Sir?

388
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,877
There's a certain key
floating around this office

389
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:38,184
from Kirkeby to Vanderhoff
to Eichelberger to Dobisch.

390
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,053
It's the key to a certain apartment,

391
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,958
and do you know
who that apartment belongs to?

392
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,120
Who?

393
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:47,096
Loyal, resourceful,
cooperative C.C. Baxter.

394
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,525
Oh.

395
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,593
Are you going to deny it?

396
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:54,362
No.

397
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,907
I'm not going to deny...
If you just let me explain.

398
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,443
You'd better.

399
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:00,970
Well.

400
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,613
About a year ago,
I was going to night school.

401
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,413
I was taking this course
in advanced accounting.

402
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:09,817
One of the guys in our department,
lives in Jersey,

403
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,482
had to go to a banquet at the Biltmore.
His wife was meeting him in town.

404
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:17,085
He needed someplace to change
into a tuxedo, so I gave him the key,

405
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:20,131
and word must have gotten out
because the next thing I knew,

406
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,133
all sorts of guys
are suddenly going to banquets.

407
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,465
You give a key to one guy,
you can't say no to another.

408
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,734
The whole thing got out of hand, and...
Pardon me.

409
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:34,509
Baxter, an insurance company
is founded on public trust.

410
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,946
Any employee who conducts himself
in a manner unbecoming...

411
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,917
How many charter members are there
in this little club of yours?

412
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:42,145
Just those four.

413
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,121
Out of a total of 31,259,

414
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,320
so actually, we can be very proud
of our personnel, percentage-wise.

415
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,759
That's not the point, Baxter.

416
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,798
Four rotten apples in a barrel,
no matter how large the barrel...

417
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,457
Do you realize if this ever leaked out...

418
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:56,898
It won't!

419
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:59,628
Believe me, never again.

420
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,571
Nobody is going to use my apartment
from now on.

421
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,336
- Where is your apartment, Baxter?
- West 67th Street.

422
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,640
You have no idea
what I've been going through

423
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,148
with the neighbors and the landlady
and the liquor and the key and...

424
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,649
How do you work it with the key?

425
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:16,346
I usually slip it to them in the office,
and they leave it under a mat.

426
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,321
Never again. I can promise you that.

427
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:19,512
(PHONE BUZZING)

428
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:22,684
Yes, Miss Olsen.

429
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,730
Mrs. Sheldrake returning your call on 2.

430
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,395
<i>Yes, dear: I called you earlier: </i>
<i>Where were you? </i>

431
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,231
Oh, you had to take Tommy
to the dentist, huh?

432
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,934
No cavities. Good. Hold it, dear.

433
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,477
- Where are you going, Baxter?
- I don't want to intrude.

434
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,638
(STAMMERING) I thought since
everything was straightened out...

435
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,545
I'm not through with you yet.

436
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,016
The reason I called
is I won't be home for dinner tonight.

437
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,144
The branch manager
from Kansas City is in town.

438
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,051
I'm taking him to the theater.

439
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,987
<i>Music Man: </i> What else?

440
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:55,753
No, don't wait up for me, darling.
Goodbye.

441
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,122
Tell me, Baxter,
have you seen <i>Music Man? </i>

442
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,321
Hmm?

443
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,162
Not yet. I hear it's one swell show.

444
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,532
How would you like to go tonight?

445
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:06,865
What, you and me?

446
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:10,135
I thought you were taking
the branch manager from Kansas City.

447
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:13,371
No. I have other plans.
You can have both tickets.

448
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:17,278
Well, that's very kind of you,
but I'm not feeling well.

449
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,873
I've got this cold.
I'm going to go right home.

450
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:23,045
Baxter, you're not reading me.
I told you I have plans.

451
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,155
So do I.
I'm going to take four aspirin, get into bed,

452
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,750
so you might as well
give the tickets to somebody else.

453
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,296
Look, Baxter,
I'm not just giving these tickets.

454
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,126
I want to swap them.

455
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,497
Swap them? For what?

456
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,095
It also says here

457
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,698
that you are alert, astute
and quite imaginative.

458
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:46,098
Oh?

459
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,939
Oh...

460
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,621
(WHISPERING) This?

461
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,218
That's good thinking, Baxter.

462
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,890
There's going to be a shift in personnel
around here next month.

463
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:11,265
As far as I'm concerned,
you are executive material.

464
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:12,929
I am?

465
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,835
Now, put down the key.

466
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,434
And put down the address.

467
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,473
It's on the second floor.
There's no name over the door.

468
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,642
It just says Apartment 2-A.

469
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,814
It's that cold.

470
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,447
- Relax, Baxter.
- Yes, thank you, sir.

471
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:36,851
You will be careful with the record player?

472
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:40,159
Oh, and about the liquor,
I ordered some this morning.

473
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,825
I don't know when they'll deliver it.

474
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,999
Now, remember, Baxter,
this is going to be our little secret.

475
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,005
- Oh, yes, of course.
- You know how people talk.

476
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,700
You don't have to worry about that.

477
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,003
Not that I have anything to hide.

478
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,806
Certainly not.
I mean, it's none of my business.

479
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:59,612
Four apples, five apples.
What's the difference, percentage-wise?

480
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,616
- Here you are, Baxter.
- Thank you, sir.

481
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,087
- Have a nice time.
- You, too, sir.

482
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:41,918
So I figure a man in his position,
he'll take me to El Morocco, maybe 21.

483
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:46,225
Instead he takes me to Hamburger Heaven
and some schnook's apartment.

484
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,328
- Good night.
- Good night.

485
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,804
Oh! Miss Kubelik?

486
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,172
I've been waiting for you.

487
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,143
- You have?
- I almost didn't recognize you.

488
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:04,375
This is the first time
I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.

489
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,314
How did everything go
on the twenty-seventh floor?

490
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,511
Great. Look, have you seen
<i>The Music Man? </i>

491
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:09,610
No.

492
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,314
- Would you like to?
- Sure.

493
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,755
I thought maybe we'd get
a bite to eat first, and then we'd go.

494
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,292
- Oh, you mean tonight?
- Yeah.

495
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,488
- I'm sorry. I can't. I'm meeting somebody.
- Oh.

496
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:22,363
- You mean, like a girlfriend?
- No, like a man.

497
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,525
I wasn't trying to be personal.

498
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,034
It's just the fellas in the office,

499
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,162
they were wondering about,
you know, if you ever...

500
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,103
You tell them now and then.

501
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:33,610
This date, is it just a date,
or is it something serious?

502
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,114
Well, it used to be serious,
at least I was, but he wasn't.

503
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,513
So now the whole thing's
more or less kaput.

504
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,314
- In that case, couldn't you...
- No, I'm afraid not.

505
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:45,550
I promised I'd have a drink with him.
He's been calling me all week.

506
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,615
I... I understand.

507
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,256
Well, it was just an idea.

508
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,264
I'd hate to see
a theater ticket go to waste.

509
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,495
- What time does the show go on?
- 8:30.

510
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,059
Well, I could meet you at the theater,
if that's all right.

511
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,730
All right? That's wonderful.

512
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,206
It's Majestic on 44th Street.

513
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,640
I'll meet you in the lobby, okay?

514
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,178
Yeah. You know,
I felt so lousy this morning.

515
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,804
Had a 101 fever.

516
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,476
Now, along comes my promotion and us.
Eleventh row, center.

517
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,644
And you said I should have stayed in bed.

518
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,915
- How is your cold?
- What cold?

519
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,423
After the show,
we could go out on the town.

520
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,856
(LILTING)

521
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:24,918
- I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
- So I see.

522
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,988
There's a great little band
at El Chico in the Village,

523
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,556
practically around the corner
from where you live.

524
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,033
Sounds good.

525
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,567
How do you know where I live?

526
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:38,541
Oh, I even know who you live with.
Your sister and brother-in-law.

527
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,271
And I know
when you were born and where.

528
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,939
- I know all sorts of things about you.
- How come?

529
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,846
A couple of months ago,
I looked up your card

530
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,044
in the group insurance file.

531
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,951
I know your height and your weight
and your Social Security number.

532
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:57,290
You had mumps and measles,
and you had your appendix out.

533
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,164
Don't mention the appendix
to the fellas in the office, okay?

534
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,790
I wouldn't want them
to get the wrong idea

535
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,358
about how you found out. Bye.

536
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,937
8:30!

537
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,556
(PIANO PLAYING)

538
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,619
Good evening, Mr. Sheldrake.

539
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:04,684
Please, Fran, not so loud.

540
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,094
Still afraid someone
might see us together?

541
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,794
- Let me take your coat.
- No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.

542
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:15,103
- Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
- It's on the way.

543
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:20,007
- I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
- That's right.

544
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:23,410
- You know I liked it better long.
- I know.

545
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:26,143
You want a lock to carry in your wallet?

546
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:30,315
- Evening, lady. Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.

547
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,849
- How long has it been, Fran, a month?
- Six weeks.

548
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,792
But who's counting?

549
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,585
I missed you.

550
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,027
Like old times.

551
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:48,099
Same booth, same song.

552
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,799
It's been hell.

553
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,871
Same sauce, sweet and sour.

554
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,476
You don't know what it's like
standing next to you

555
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,139
in that elevator day after day.

556
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,708
"Good morning, Miss Kubelik."
"Good night, Mr. Sheldrake."

557
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,220
I'm still crazy about you, Fran.

558
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:07,223
Let's not start on that again, Jeff, please.

559
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,393
I'm just beginning to get over it.

560
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,925
I don't believe you.

561
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:19,063
Look, Jeff, we had two wonderful months
this summer, but that was it.

562
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,899
Happens all the time.

563
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:25,136
Wife and kids go away to the country,
and the boss has a fling with his secretary

564
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:28,042
or the manicurist or the elevator girl.

565
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:31,513
Come September, the picnic's over.
Goodbye.

566
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:35,575
The kids go back to school,
the boss goes back to the wife,

567
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,143
and the girl...

568
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,384
They don't make these shrimp
like they used to.

569
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,556
I never said goodbye, Fran.

570
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:55,037
For a while there, you try kidding yourself
that you're going with an unmarried man.

571
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,939
Then one day he keeps
looking at his watch

572
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,739
and asks you if
there's any lipstick showing,

573
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:04,110
then rushes out to catch
the 7:14 to White Plains.

574
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:09,111
So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee,

575
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:12,121
and you sit there by yourself,
and you think.

576
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:17,157
And it all begins to look so ugly.

577
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:24,289
How do you think I felt
riding home on that 7:14 train?

578
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:29,099
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff?
What do you want from me?

579
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:31,198
I want you back, Fran.

580
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:35,075
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheldrake. I'm full up.
You'll have to take the next elevator.

581
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,977
You're not giving me a chance, Fran.

582
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,312
I asked you to meet me
because I have something to tell you.

583
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:42,079
- Go ahead, tell me.
- Not here.

584
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:46,556
- Can't we go someplace else?
- No. I have a date at 8:30.

585
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:47,750
Important?

586
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,419
Not very,
but I'm going to be there anyway.

587
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,258
- You ready order dinner now?
- No. No dinner.

588
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,061
Just bring us two more drinks, will you?

589
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:14,214
(COUGHS)

590
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,550
Fran, do you remember
that last weekend we had?

591
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,886
Do I? That leaky little boat you rented

592
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:23,688
and me in a black negligee
and a life preserver.

593
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:27,527
- You remember what we talked about?
- We talked about a lot of things.

594
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,930
I mean, about my getting a divorce.

595
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,298
We didn't talk about it, Jeff. You did.

596
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,600
You didn't really believe me, did you?

597
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:39,200

We haven't gotten along for years.

599
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,074
"You're the best thing
that ever happened to me."

600
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,308
That's enough, Fran.

601
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,715
"Just trust me, baby.
We'll work it out somehow."

602
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,252
You're not being funny.

603
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,878
I wasn't trying.

604
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,219
Fran, if you'll just listen to me
for a minute.

605
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,917
All right, I'm sorry.

606
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:56,516
I saw my lawyer this morning.

607
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:59,893
I wanted his advice
about the best way to handle it.

608
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,931
- Handle what?
- What do you think?

609
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:08,864
Let's get something straight, Jeff.
I never asked you to leave your wife.

610
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,840
Of course not.
You had nothing to do with it.

611
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,045
Are you sure that's what you want?

612
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,180
I'm sure.

613
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:21,743
If you'll just tell me that you still love me.

614
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,011
You know I do.

615
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:29,752

and take Sylvia to a drive-in in Jersey.

- Oh, fine.
- Sit down.

666
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:30,295
I want you to know I'll work hard
to justify your confidence in me.

667
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:31,994
I'm sure you will.

668
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,594
So, Baxter, about the apartment,
now that you've got a raise,

669
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,970
don't you think
we can afford a second key?

670
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,441
- Well, I guess so.
- You know my secretary Miss Olsen.

671
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,944
Oh, yeah, very attractive.
Is she the lucky girl that...

672
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,570
Oh, no, no, no. I just meant that she's...

673
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,115
She's kind of a busybody,
always sticking her nose in everything,

674
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,651
and passing that key back and forth,
why take chances?

675
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,653
Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.

676
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:54,122
- I have something I think belongs to you.
- Me?

677
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,091
I mean, the young lady,
whoever she may be.

678
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,991
It was on my couch
when I got back last night.

679
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,188
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

680
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,596
The mirror is broken.
It was broken when I found it.

681
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:07,266
- Yeah. She threw it at me.
- Sir?

682
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:10,135
Well, you know how it is. Sooner or later,
they always give you a bad time.

683
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,231
Yeah, I know how it is.

684
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,401
You see a girl a couple times a week,
just for laughs,

685
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:15,945
and right away they think
you're going to divorce your wife.

686
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,640
Now, I ask you, is that fair?

687
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,582
No, sir, it's very unfair.
Especially to your wife.

688
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:21,777
Yeah.

689
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:23,149
You know, Baxter, I envy you.

690
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,553
Bachelor, all the dames you want,
no headaches, no complications.

691
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:28,181
Yes, sir, that's the life, all right.

692
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,953
Oh, put me down for Thursday again.

693
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,587
Roger, and I'll get that other key.

694
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,540
SYLVIA: Merry Christmas. I'll connect you.

695
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,043
Merry Christmas. Consolidated Life.

696
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:50,046

697
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,103
I'm ringing.

698
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,479
Yeah? Yeah!

699
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,814
Where? You bet!

700
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,183
Somebody watch my line!

701
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:00,314
There's a swinging party
on the nineteenth floor!

702
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:06,023
<i>Oh, what fun it is to ride</i>
<i>in a one horse open sleigh</i>

703
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,554
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

704
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:13,000

<i>in a one horse open sleigh</i>

705
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:16,564

<i>In a one horse open sleigh</i>

706
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,301
<i>O'er the fields we go</i>
<i>Laughing all the way</i>

707
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:23,479
<i>Bells on bobtails ring</i>
<i>Making spirits bright</i>

708
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:26,778
<i>What fun it is to laugh and sing</i>
<i>A sleighing song tonight</i>

709
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:28,747
ALL: Hey!

710
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,744
So I said to him, "Never again.

711
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:33,984
"Either you get yourself a bigger car
or a smaller girl."

712
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:37,689
Miss Kubelik! Miss...

713
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:39,422
Merry Christmas.

714
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:41,726
Thank you.
I thought you were avoiding me.

715
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,391
What gave you that idea?

716
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,662
In the last six weeks,
you've only been in my elevator once,

717
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,260
and you didn't take off your hat.

718
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:50,738
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt
that night you stood me up.

719
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,003
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.

720
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:54,668
- I forgive you.
- You shouldn't.

721
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:57,407
You couldn't help yourself. I mean,
when you're having a drink with one man,

722
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,573
you can't suddenly walk out on him

723
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,810
because you're having another date
with another man.

724
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:02,283
You did the only decent thing.

725
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,410
I wouldn't be too sure.

726
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,854
Just because I wear a uniform,
that doesn't make me a girl scout.

727
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,221
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be

728
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,089
a Second Administrative Assistant
around here

729
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,151
unless he's a pretty good judge
of character,

730
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:14,424
and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops.

731
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:19,197
I mean, decency-wise and otherwise-wise.

732
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,294
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

733
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,299
- One more.
- Oh, I shouldn't drink while I'm driving.

734
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,808
You're so right.

735
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:28,674
By the power vested in me,

736
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:30,576
I herewith declare this elevator
out of order.

737
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,137
Shall we join the natives?

738
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,111
Why not? They seem friendly enough.

739
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,812
Don't you believe it.

740
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:38,752
After a while,
there will be human sacrifices.

741
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:41,120
White-collar workers
tossed into the computing machines

742
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,352
and punched full
of those little square holes.

743
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:45,622
- How many drinks did you have?
- Three.

744
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,890
I thought so.

745
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:49,262
Wait a minute.
I think I hear the sound of running water.

746
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:52,097
- I'll be right back!
- I'll be right here.

747
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:57,772
Hi. How's the branch manager
from Kansas City?

748
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:58,865
I beg your pardon?

749
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:01,809
- I'm Miss Olsen, Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
- Yes, I know.

750
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,143
So you don't have to
play innocent with me.

751
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:08,275
He used to tell his wife
I was the branch manager from Seattle

752
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:12,914
four years ago when we were having
a little ring-a-ding-ding.

753
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:15,457
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

754
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:17,823
And just before me,
there was Miss Rossi in Auditing,

755
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,796
and after me,
there was Miss Koch in Disability,

756
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:25,767
and right before you was a Miss...
What's-her-name on the twenty-fifth floor.

757
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:29,567
- Would you excuse me?
- What for? You haven't done anything.

758
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,404
It's him. Oh, what a salesman.

759
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,670
Always the last booth
in the Chinese restaurant

760
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,647
and the same pitch
about divorcing his wife.

761
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:44,979
And in the end, you wind up
with Egg Foo Yung on your face.

762
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:46,879
Miss Kubelik.

763
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,652
Well, thank you, Miss Olsen.

764
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:55,687
Always happy to do a little something
for our girls in uniform.

765
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,097
Are you all right? What's the matter?

766
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:01,899
Nothing. There are
just too many people here.

767
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,496
Why don't we step into my office?

768
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,871
There's something
I want your opinion about, anyhow.

769
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,410
I have my own office now, actually.

770
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:09,138
You may be interested to know that I am

771
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:10,873
the second-youngest executive
in this company.

772
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,611

of the Chairman of the Board.

00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:25,291
Miss Kubelik,
I would like your honest opinion.

776
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:29,232
I've had this under my desk for a week.
It cost me $15.

777
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,632
Haven't been able
to get up enough nerve to wear it.

778
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,836
It's what they call
the Junior Executive model.

779
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,503
What do you think?

780
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:48,777
I guess I made a boo-boo, huh?

781
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:51,085
I like it.

782
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:53,218
Really? You wouldn't
be ashamed to be seen

783
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,087
with somebody in a hat like this?

784
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,887
Of course not.

785
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,896
Maybe if I wore it a little more to one side.
How's that? Is that better?

786
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:02,261
Much better.

787
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,698
Well, since you wouldn't be ashamed
to be seen with me,

788
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:06,429
how about the three of us
going out tonight?

789
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,061
You, me and the bowler.

790
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:10,698
We'll stroll down Fifth Avenue,
sort of break it in.

791
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,071
This is a bad day for me.

792
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:15,009
Oh, I understand.
Christmas, family and all that.

793
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:17,569
I'd better get back to my elevator.
I don't want to be fired.

794
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:21,481
You don't have to worry about that.
I got quite a bit of influence in personnel.

795
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,485
You know Mr. Sheldrake?

796
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:27,486
- Why?
- Well, he and I are like that.

797
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:30,219
He sent me a Christmas card, see?

798
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:38,097
Makes a cute picture.

799
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,068
I thought maybe I'd put in a word for you

800
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,571
with Mr. Sheldrake,
get you a little promotion.

like to be an elevator starter?

802
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:48,603
I'm afraid there are too many girls
around here with seniority over me.

803
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:51,943
No problem. Why don't we discuss it
sometime over the holidays?

804
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:54,449
I could call you and pick you up.
We'd have a big unveiling.

805
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,383
Are you sure this is
the right way to wear this?

806
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,648
I think so. Here.

807
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,246
You don't think
it's tilted a little too much?

808
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:02,018
I mean, after all,
this is a conservative firm.

809
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:05,220
I don't want people to think
I'm an entertainer.

811
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:13,835
Well, uh...

Well, I never was very good at history.

Let me see. There was Miss Olsen,
and then there was Miss Rossi.

I guess I deserve that, but ask yourself,

898
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:52,663
why does a man run around
with a lot of girls?

899
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:56,603
Because he's unhappy at home.
Because he's Ionely, that's why.

But that was before you, Fran.
I've stopped running.

You'd think I would have learned by now.

01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,409
As a matter of fact, I'm counting on you.

1169
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:55,506
Yes, sir. I understand. She left a letter.

1170
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:58,485
Would you like me to open it
and read it to you?

1171
01:20:58,553 --> 01:21:00,953
It was just a suggestion.

1172
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:03,084
No, you don't have to worry about that.

1173
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:04,318
I kept your name out of it,

1174
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:07,953
so there will be no trouble
police-wise or newspaper-wise.

1175
01:21:09,097 --> 01:21:13,534
You see, the doctor is a friend of mine,
so we were very lucky in that respect.

1176
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:16,093
Actually, he thinks she's my girl.

1177
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:19,270
No. He just jumped to the conclusion.

1178
01:21:19,341 --> 01:21:22,242
Around here,
I'm known as quite a ladies' man.

1179
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:26,644
Of course, we're not out of the woods yet.
Sometimes they try it again.

1180
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:28,114
Yes, sir, I'll do my best.

1181
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:30,947
It looks like it'll be a couple of days
before she's fully recovered.

1182
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:34,216
And I may have a little problem
with the landlady.

1183
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:37,988
All right, Mr. Sheldrake, I'll keep her
in the apartment as long as I can.

1184
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:41,654
Isn't there some sort of message
you want me to give her?

1185
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,398
Well, I'll think of something.

1186
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:47,566
Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

1187
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:51,461
I'm sorry.

1188
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:54,364
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.

1189
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:56,740
Miss Kubelik,
what are you doing out of bed?

1190
01:21:56,811 --> 01:22:00,178
I didn't know.
I had no idea this was your apartment.

1191
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:02,148
Here. Let me help you.

1192
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,276
I'm so ashamed.

1193
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:07,719
Why didn't you just let me die?

1194
01:22:07,789 --> 01:22:11,225
What kind of talk is that?
You got a little overemotional.

1195
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:12,885
You're fine now.

1196
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,250
Oh.

1197
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:19,127
Oh, my head.
It feels just like a big wad of chewing gum.

1198
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,135
- What time is it?
- 2:00.

1199
01:22:22,203 --> 01:22:24,535
My dress. I have to go home.

1200
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:27,006
You're in no shape
to go anywhere but back to bed.

1201
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:29,873
- You don't want me here.
- Sure, I do.

1202
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:32,709
It's always nice to have company
for Christmas.

1203
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,806
I'm stronger than you are, Miss Kubelik.

1204
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:37,181
- I just want to brush my teeth.
- Oh.

1205
01:22:37,919 --> 01:22:40,387
Of course. I think I can find
a new toothbrush somewhere.

1206
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,582
Here. Put that on.

1207
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:15,555
- How about some breakfast?
- No. I don't want anything.

1208
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:17,557
I'll fix you some coffee.

1209
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:22,155
We're all out of coffee.
You had quite a lot last night.

1210
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:23,891
Back in a minute.

1211
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:36,141
Mrs. Dreyfuss,
I wonder if I could borrow some coffee,

1212
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:37,940
and maybe an orange,
and a couple of eggs.

1213
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:41,779
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges!
What you need is a good horsewhipping.

1214
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,785
- Ma'am?
- From me, the doctor has no secrets.

1215
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:47,344
Poor girl.
How could you do a thing like that?

1216
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:50,949
Please. I didn't do anything, honest.
It's just... I mean...

1217
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,460
You take a girl out
a couple of times just for laughs,

1218
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:56,497
and right away, she thinks
you're getting serious marriage-wise.

1219
01:23:56,564 --> 01:24:00,159
Big shot. For you, I wouldn't lift a finger.

1220
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:03,398
But for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.

1221
01:24:11,813 --> 01:24:13,644
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?

1222
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,910
My sister.
She'll want to know what happened to me.

1223
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:17,451
Wait a minute!

1224
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:21,619
Let's talk it over first.
Just what are you going to tell her?

1225
01:24:21,689 --> 01:24:23,452
I haven't figured it out exactly.

1226
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:25,857
Well, you better figure it out exactly.

1227
01:24:25,927 --> 01:24:29,055
Suppose she asks you
why you didn't come home last night.

1228
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:30,961
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.

1229
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:33,262
- Who?
- Someone from the office.

1230
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:35,097
- Where are you now?
- In his apartment.

1231
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:37,638
- In his apartment?
- In her apartment.

1232
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:40,003
- What's your friend's name?
- Baxter.

1233
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:42,543
- What's her first name?
- Miss.

1234
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:46,073
- When are you coming home?
- As soon as I can walk.

1235
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:48,342
- Something's wrong with your legs?
- No, my stomach.

1236
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:51,408
- Your stomach?
- They had to pump it out.

1237
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:53,818
Miss Kubelik,
I don't think you ought to call anybody,

1238
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:56,356
not till you get the chewing gum
out of your head.

1239
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:57,789
They'll be worried about me.

1240
01:24:57,859 --> 01:24:59,793
My brother-in-law
might be calling the police.

1241
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:02,921
That's why we have to be careful.
We don't want to involve anybody.

1242
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:05,761
After all, Mr. Sheldrake's a married man.

1243
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:09,026
Thanks for reminding me.

1244
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:14,775
I didn't mean it that way.

1245
01:25:14,843 --> 01:25:19,177
I was just talking to him on the phone.
He's very concerned about you.

1246
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:21,647
He doesn't give a damn about me.

1247
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,812
You're wrong. He told me...

1248
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:27,321
He's a liar, and that's not the worst part.

1249
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:30,781
The worst part is, I still love him.

1250

(DOORBELL RINGING)

1251
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:36,323
Oh, that must be Mrs. Dreyfuss.

1252
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:40,794
You remember the doctor from last night?
That's his wife.

1253
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:44,237
So where's the victim?

1254
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:46,763
Max the knife.

1255
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:54,371
<i>-Nu, </i> little lady, how are we feeling today?
- I don't know. Kind of dizzy.

1256
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:56,815
Here. The best thing for dizzy
is a little noodle soup

1257
01:25:56,885 --> 01:25:59,945
with chicken, white meat and a glass tea.

1258
01:26:00,021 --> 01:26:01,682
No, thank you. I'm really not hungry.

1259
01:26:01,756 --> 01:26:03,951
Go ahead. Eat. Enjoy.

1260
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:07,385
You wouldn't have
such a thing as a napkin, would you?

1261
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:10,795
- Well, I have some paper towels.
- Beatnik.

1262
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:14,323
Go to my kitchen, third drawer,
under the good silver, there is napkins.

1263
01:26:14,402 --> 01:26:15,960
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss.

1264
01:26:16,037 --> 01:26:18,505
So, what are you waiting for,
a singing commercial?

1265
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:19,562
I can't eat.

1266
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:23,577
You must eat, and you must get healthy,
and you must forget him.

1267
01:26:24,379 --> 01:26:27,712
Such a fine boy he seemed
when he first moved in here.

1268
01:26:27,782 --> 01:26:30,683
Clean and cut, a regular Ivy Leaguer.

1269
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:32,845
Turns out he's King Farouk

1270
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:37,255
with the drinking,
with the cha-cha, with the no napkins.

1271
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:41,527
A girl like you, for the rest of your life,
you want to cry in your noodle soup?

1272
01:26:41,596 --> 01:26:44,326
Who needs it? You listen to me.

1273
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:48,563
You find yourself a nice, substantial man,
a widower maybe,

1274
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:52,470
and settle down
instead of noshing all those sleeping pills.

1275
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:55,600
For what? For whom?
For some good-time Charlie?

1276
01:26:55,677 --> 01:26:57,338
(DOOR OPENS)

1277
01:26:57,812 --> 01:26:59,803
One napkin, coming up.

1278
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:01,849
I wish we had some champagne
to wrap it around.

1279
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:03,577
What did I tell you?

1280
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:06,119
Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait.
I'll wash the dishes.

1281
01:27:06,187 --> 01:27:09,281
You wash them, you break them.
I'll come back for them later.

1282
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:11,951
If he makes trouble, give me a yell.

1283
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:16,493
- She doesn't seem to like you very much.
- Oh, I don't mind.

1284
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:19,833
As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered

1285
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:21,869
that anybody'd think a girl like you

1286
01:27:21,936 --> 01:27:25,030
would do a thing like this
over a guy like me.

1287
01:27:26,207 --> 01:27:28,937
Did you find something here?
An envelope?

1288
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:31,139
Yes. I've got it.

1289
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:35,649
Don't you think we'd better destroy it
so it won't fall in the wrong hands?

1290
01:27:35,717 --> 01:27:37,014
Open it.

1291
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:45,453
- There's nothing here but a $100 bill.
- That's right.

1292
01:27:45,526 --> 01:27:49,428
- Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
- Sure.

1293
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,468
Take this away, will you?

1294
01:27:55,069 --> 01:27:57,799
Would you like me
to move the television set in here?

1295
01:27:57,872 --> 01:27:59,703
Do you play gin rummy?

1296
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:02,368
- I'm not very good at it.
- I am. Let me get the cards.

1297
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:05,003
You don't have to entertain me,
Mr. Baxter.

1298
01:28:05,079 --> 01:28:08,776
There's nothing I'd like better.
You know, togetherness.

1299
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:10,579
Guess what I did last Christmas?

1300
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:13,678
Had an early dinner at the automat,
went to the zoo,

1301
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:16,553
and then I came home
and cleaned up after Mr. Eichelberger.

1302
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:19,058
He had a little eggnog party here.

1303
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:20,924
So I'm way ahead this year.

1304
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:25,191
Three across. Spades double. High deals.

1305
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:28,727
Six. Eight.

1306
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:39,870
I think I'm going to give it all up.

1307
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:42,939
Give what up?

1308
01:28:46,421 --> 01:28:49,322
Why do people have
to love people, anyway?

1309
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:52,421
I know what you mean.

1310
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:55,758
Nine, ten...

1311
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,224
Queen.

1312
01:29:00,935 --> 01:29:02,334
I don't want it.

1313
01:29:02,403 --> 01:29:03,893
Pick a card.

1314
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:09,599
What do you call it when somebody

1315
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:12,612
keeps getting smashed up
in automobile accidents?

1316
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,614
A bad insurance risk?

1317
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:16,479
That's me with men.

1318
01:29:17,685 --> 01:29:19,414
I was jinxed from the word go.

1319
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:22,422
First time I was ever kissed
was in a cemetery.

1320
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:23,821
Cemetery?

1321
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:27,355
I was 15. We used to go there to smoke.

1322
01:29:27,729 --> 01:29:29,026
His name was George,

1323
01:29:29,097 --> 01:29:31,793
and he threw me over
for a drum majorette.

1324
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,297
Gin.

1325
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:44,043
That's 10, 20, 36 and 25,
makes 61 and two boxes.

1326
01:29:44,112 --> 01:29:47,513
I just have this talent
for falling in love with the wrong guy

1327
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:50,176
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1328
01:29:50,618 --> 01:29:52,711
How many guys were there?

1329
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:55,082
Three.

1330
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:58,255
The last one was the manager
of a finance company

1331
01:29:58,326 --> 01:29:59,850
back home in Pittsburgh.

1332
01:29:59,927 --> 01:30:01,895
They found a little shortage
in his accounts,

1333
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:03,362
but he asked me to wait for him.

1334
01:30:03,431 --> 01:30:05,296
He'll be out in 1965.

1335
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:08,562
Cut.

1336
01:30:10,138 --> 01:30:13,130
I came to New York and moved in
with my sister and her husband.

1337
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:14,799
He drives a cab.

1338
01:30:15,376 --> 01:30:17,276
They sent me to secretarial school,

1339
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:20,314
and then I applied for a job
at Consolidated,

1340
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:22,611
but I flunked the typing test.

1341
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:25,618
- Too slow?
- No. I can type up a storm.

1342
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:27,483
I just can't spell.

1343
01:30:28,689 --> 01:30:32,819
So they gave me a pair of white gloves
and stuck me in an elevator,

1344
01:30:33,795 --> 01:30:35,820
and that's how I met Jeff.

1345
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:39,691
Oh, God, I'm so fouled-up.

1346
01:30:40,535 --> 01:30:42,594
What am I going to do now?

1347
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:47,600
Better win a hand. You're on a blitz.

1348
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:51,401
Was he very upset when you told him?

1349
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:54,005
Mr. Sheldrake? Yeah. Very.

1350
01:30:55,149 --> 01:30:56,411
Maybe he does love me,

1351
01:30:56,484 --> 01:30:58,952
only he doesn't have the nerve
to tell his wife.

1352
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,612
I'm sure that's the explanation.

1353
01:31:00,688 --> 01:31:03,486
- You really think so?
- No doubt about it.

1354
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:07,588
Would you hand me that pad and pencil?

1355
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:08,924
What for?

1356
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:10,964
I'm going to write a letter
to Mrs. Sheldrake.

1357
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:12,260
You what?

1358
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:15,166
As one woman to another,
I'm sure she'll understand.

1359
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:17,568
I don't think that's a very good idea,

Why not?

1361
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,971
For one thing, you can't spell.

1362
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:24,876
Secondly, if you did something like that,
you'd hate yourself.

1363
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,908
I don't like myself very much, anyway.

- You bet. I got a terrific hand.

- Sure.

01:41:56,844 --> 01:41:59,506
Well, things are
a little disorganized around here.

1495
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:00,979
I'd say.

1496
01:42:01,048 --> 01:42:03,448
What's a tennis racket
doing in the kitchen?

1497
01:42:03,517 --> 01:42:04,745
Tennis racket?

1498
01:42:04,818 --> 01:42:08,413
Oh, I remember.
I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.

1499
01:42:08,489 --> 01:42:11,287
I used it to strain the spaghetti.

1500
01:42:11,358 --> 01:42:12,347
Why not?

1501
01:42:12,426 --> 01:42:14,189
As a matter of fact,
I'm a pretty good cook,

1502
01:42:14,261 --> 01:42:15,990
only, I'm a lousy housekeeper.

1503
01:42:16,063 --> 01:42:17,257
Yes, you are.

1504
01:42:17,331 --> 01:42:19,856
When I was straightening up the couch,
you know what I found?

1505
01:42:19,933 --> 01:42:22,731
Six hairpins, a lipstick,
a pair of false eyelashes,

1506
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:25,499
and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.

1507
01:42:25,572 --> 01:42:28,700
It's just that I'm the kind of guy
who can't say no.

1508
01:42:28,775 --> 01:42:30,606
I don't mean to girls. I mean...

1509
01:42:30,677 --> 01:42:33,077
You mean,
to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.

1510
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:34,580
I guess so.

1511
01:42:35,048 --> 01:42:36,447
I know so.

1512
01:42:37,851 --> 01:42:39,409
He's a taker.

1513
01:42:39,486 --> 01:42:40,953
A what?

1514
01:42:41,021 --> 01:42:43,080
Some people take, some people get took,

1515
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:47,287
and they know they're getting took,
and there's nothing they can do about it.

1516
01:42:47,361 --> 01:42:49,124
I wouldn't say that.

1517
01:42:50,130 --> 01:42:52,325
What would you like to have for dinner?

1518
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:55,630
Hey. Onion soup and canned asparagus...

1519
01:42:55,702 --> 01:42:57,795
I really should be getting home.

1520
01:42:57,871 --> 01:42:59,463
My family will be flipping by now.

1521
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:00,802
You can't leave yet.

1522
01:43:00,874 --> 01:43:04,935
The doctor said it takes 48 hours
to get that stuff out of your system.

1523
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,572
I wonder how long it takes

1524
01:43:07,648 --> 01:43:10,981
to get someone you're stuck on
out of your system.

1525
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:13,918
If only they'd invent
some kind of pump for that.

1526
01:43:13,987 --> 01:43:16,421
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik.

1527
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:19,755
You think it's the end of the world,
but it's not.

1528
01:43:19,826 --> 01:43:22,351
I went through
exactly the same thing myself.

1529
01:43:22,429 --> 01:43:24,420
- You did?
- Well, maybe not exactly the same.

1530
01:43:24,498 --> 01:43:26,329
I tried to do it with a gun.

1531
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,129
- Over a girl?
- Worse than that.

1532
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:31,433
It was the wife of my best friend,
and I was mad about her.

1533
01:43:31,505 --> 01:43:34,269
But I knew it was hopeless,
and I decided to end it all.

1534
01:43:34,341 --> 01:43:37,276
I went to a pawnshop
and bought a.45 automatic,

1535
01:43:37,344 --> 01:43:39,141
and I drove up to Eden Park...

1536
01:43:39,213 --> 01:43:41,204
- You know Cincinnati?
- No, I don't.

1537
01:43:41,281 --> 01:43:43,772
Well, anyway, I parked the car
and loaded that gun.

1538
01:43:43,850 --> 01:43:46,683
You read in the papers all the time
that people shoot themselves?

1539
01:43:46,753 --> 01:43:48,618
Believe me, it's not that easy.

1540
01:43:48,689 --> 01:43:52,284
I mean, how do you do it?
Here? Here? Here?

1541
01:43:53,694 --> 01:43:55,389
You know where I finally shot myself?

1542
01:43:55,462 --> 01:43:57,225
- Where?
- Here.

1543
01:43:57,297 --> 01:43:58,321
In the knee?

1544
01:43:58,398 --> 01:44:01,026
Yeah. While I was sitting there
trying to make up my mind,

1545
01:44:01,101 --> 01:44:03,467
a cop stuck his head in the car
because I was illegally parked

1546
01:44:03,537 --> 01:44:07,029
and I tried to hide the gun
under the seat, and it went off.

1547
01:44:07,107 --> 01:44:08,438
That's terrible.

1548
01:44:08,508 --> 01:44:10,999
It was a year
before I could bend the knee,

1549
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:13,979
but I got over the girl in three weeks.

1550
01:44:15,716 --> 01:44:19,277
She still lives in Cincinnati,
has four kids and gained 20 pounds.

1551
01:44:19,353 --> 01:44:22,083
Sends me a fruitcake every Christmas.

1552
01:44:22,155 --> 01:44:24,623
Are you just making this up
to make me feel better?

1553
01:44:24,691 --> 01:44:26,420
Of course not! Here's the fruitcake.

1554
01:44:26,493 --> 01:44:29,257
- Do you want to see my knee?
- No, thank you.

1555
01:44:29,329 --> 01:44:32,230
The fellas in the office
might get the wrong idea how I found out.

1556
01:44:32,299 --> 01:44:33,425
Let them.

1557
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,990
Look, I'm going to cook dinner
for us tonight

1558
01:44:35,068 --> 01:44:36,797
and you have the fruitcake for dessert.

1559
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:40,101
You just sit there and rest.
You've done enough for today.

01:44:40,173 --> 01:44:41,538
Yes, nurse.

- No.

Thanks.

So yesterday afternoon,
I take Sylvia up to the apartment,

1571
01:45:17,477 --> 01:45:19,638
and guess who
he's got stashed away in the bedroom.

1572
01:45:19,713 --> 01:45:21,044
- Who?
- Kubelik.

1573
01:45:21,114 --> 01:45:24,413
No kidding? Buddy-boy and Kubelik
having themselves a little toot.

1574
01:45:24,484 --> 01:45:27,282
Toot? More like a lost weekend.

showed up for work today.

01:45:30,657 --> 01:45:33,387

were guzzling my champagne

01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:37,157
while Sylvia and I wound up
at the Guggenheim Museum.

- Mr. Dobisch?
- Yeah?

- Miss Kubelik?

1583
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:48,366
- You know her?
- Of course.

1584
01:45:48,442 --> 01:45:51,639
There may be a lot of employees here,
but we're one big, happy family.

01:45:51,712 --> 01:45:54,146
Well, she lives with us

I mean, shipwrecked
among eight million people

1606
01:47:30,477 --> 01:47:33,844

I saw a footprint in the sand,

1607

- You usually eat alone?
- Oh, no.

01:50:11,738 --> 01:50:13,296
MATUSCHKA: Come on, Fran.

1659
01:50:13,373 --> 01:50:15,170
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.

1660
01:50:20,714 --> 01:50:22,306
Goodbye, Doctor.

1661
01:50:24,751 --> 01:50:26,719
Well, I don't want to gloat,

1662
01:50:26,786 --> 01:50:29,778
but just between us,
you had it coming to you.

1663
01:50:29,956 --> 01:50:31,685
(TSKING)

1664
01:50:31,758 --> 01:50:34,056
You're going to have a shiner tomorrow.

1665
01:50:34,894 --> 01:50:36,555
Let me get my bag.

1666
01:50:38,898 --> 01:50:40,593
Don't bother, Doc.

1667
01:50:41,101 --> 01:50:42,693
It doesn't hurt a bit.

1668
01:51:05,058 --> 01:51:07,083
Mr. Sheldrake's office? This is C.C. Baxter.

1669
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:09,424
Would you please tell Mr. Sheldrake
I'd like to come up and see him?

1670
01:51:09,496 --> 01:51:10,622
It's rather important.

1671
01:51:10,697 --> 01:51:12,631
Will you call me back, please?

1672
01:51:15,602 --> 01:51:18,730
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1673
01:51:19,773 --> 01:51:21,866
All your troubles are over.

1674
01:51:23,143 --> 01:51:26,135
I'm going to take Miss Kubelik
off your hands.

1675
01:51:26,713 --> 01:51:29,375
The plain fact is, I love her.

1676
01:51:30,083 --> 01:51:32,813
I haven't told her yet. I thought that
you should be the first to know.

1677
01:51:32,886 --> 01:51:35,878
After all, you don't really
want her, and I do,

1678
01:51:35,955 --> 01:51:40,051
and although it may sound presumptuous,
she needs somebody like me.

1679
01:51:40,126 --> 01:51:42,219
So I think it would be
the best thing all around,

1680
01:51:42,295 --> 01:51:43,762
(PHONE RINGING)

1681
01:51:43,963 --> 01:51:45,191
solution-wise.

1682
01:51:45,265 --> 01:51:46,527
Yes?

1683
01:51:46,599 --> 01:51:48,226
I'll be right up.

1684
01:51:48,902 --> 01:51:52,338
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1685
01:51:52,405 --> 01:51:54,236
All your troubles are over.

1686
01:51:58,878 --> 01:52:00,243
Nineteen.

1687
01:52:01,314 --> 01:52:03,339
Hiya, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?

1688
01:52:03,416 --> 01:52:06,510
Hit by a swinging door?
Or maybe a yellow cab?

1689
01:52:06,586 --> 01:52:08,019
That guy really must have belted him.

1690
01:52:08,088 --> 01:52:10,750
Yeah. He's punchy. Talking to himself.

1691
01:52:11,491 --> 01:52:12,856
Twenty-seven.

1692
01:52:12,926 --> 01:52:15,724
You see, Mr. Sheldrake,
those two days she spent in the apartment

1693
01:52:15,795 --> 01:52:18,787
have made me realize
how Ionely I'd been before.

1694
01:52:18,865 --> 01:52:22,357
Thanks to you,
I'm in a financial position to marry her.

1695
01:52:22,435 --> 01:52:25,632
If I can ever square things
with her family.

1696
01:52:25,705 --> 01:52:27,798
Good morning. C.C. Baxter.

1697
01:52:29,142 --> 01:52:30,302
(BUZZING)

1698
01:52:31,978 --> 01:52:34,344
<i>-WOMAN: Mr: Baxter is here: </i>
- Send him in.

1699
01:52:36,549 --> 01:52:39,313
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you.

1700
01:52:39,385 --> 01:52:41,546
I've got good news for you, Baxter.

1701
01:52:41,621 --> 01:52:44,215
- All your troubles are over.
- Sir?

1702
01:52:44,290 --> 01:52:46,520
I know how worried you were
about Miss Kubelik.

1703
01:52:46,593 --> 01:52:50,586
Well, stop worrying.
I'm going to take her off your hands.

1704
01:52:50,663 --> 01:52:52,392
You're going to take her off my hands?

1705
01:52:52,465 --> 01:52:55,662
That's right, Baxter.
I've moved out of the house.

1706
01:52:56,970 --> 01:52:59,962
I'm going to be staying in town
at the athletic club.

1707
01:53:00,039 --> 01:53:01,404
You left your wife?

1708
01:53:01,474 --> 01:53:03,339
If you must know, I fired my secretary,

1709
01:53:03,409 --> 01:53:06,105
my secretary got to my wife,
and my wife fired me.

1710
01:53:06,179 --> 01:53:09,080
- Ain't that a kick in the head?
- Yeah.

1711
01:53:10,016 --> 01:53:12,246
Now, what's your news, Baxter?

1712
01:53:13,953 --> 01:53:15,079
It's about Miss Kubelik.

1713
01:53:15,155 --> 01:53:17,885
She's feeling all right again
so she went back home.

1714
01:53:17,957 --> 01:53:20,983
Swell. And don't think
I've forgotten what you did for me.

1715
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:22,687
This way, Baxter.

1716
01:53:26,533 --> 01:53:29,001
Sit down. Try it on for size.

1717
01:53:30,069 --> 01:53:32,537
- You like? It's all yours.
- Mine?

1718
01:53:32,605 --> 01:53:34,869
My assistant, Roy Thompson,
has been shifted to the Denver office,

1719
01:53:34,941 --> 01:53:37,068
and you're taking his place.

1720
01:53:37,911 --> 01:53:40,641
What's the matter, Baxter?
You don't seem very excited.

1721
01:53:40,713 --> 01:53:44,911
Well, it's just that so many things
have been happening so fast.

1722
01:53:44,984 --> 01:53:47,680
I'm very pleased,
especially for Miss Kubelik.

1723
01:53:47,754 --> 01:53:50,416
Now that I've gotten to know her better,
I think she's the kind of girl

1724
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:53,015
that definitely ought to be married
to someone.

1725
01:53:53,092 --> 01:53:54,753
Well, sure, sure.

1726
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:56,762
First the property settlement
has to be worked out

1727
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:58,627
and then it takes six weeks in Reno.

1728
01:53:58,698 --> 01:54:01,394
Meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy
being a bachelor for a while.

1729
01:54:01,467 --> 01:54:03,094
Oh, by the way, Baxter,
you now can have lunch

1730
01:54:03,169 --> 01:54:05,228
- In the executive dining room.
- Yes, sir.

1731
01:54:05,305 --> 01:54:08,240
That's just one of the privileges
that goes with this job.

1732
01:54:08,308 --> 01:54:11,835
You also get a nice little expense account,
use of the executive washroom...

1733
01:54:12,846 --> 01:54:15,337
Say, what happened to you, Baxter?

1734
01:54:15,415 --> 01:54:17,849
- I got kicked in the head, too.
- Oh.

1735
01:54:39,205 --> 01:54:41,400
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.

1736
01:54:41,474 --> 01:54:44,238
Oh, Miss Kubelik.

1737
01:54:45,178 --> 01:54:46,770
- How are you feeling?
- I feel fine.

1738
01:54:46,846 --> 01:54:48,871
- How's your eye?
- Oh, fine.

1739
01:54:48,948 --> 01:54:51,610
- How's everything at the apartment?
- Nothing's changed.

1740
01:54:51,684 --> 01:54:53,618
You know,
we never did finish that gin game.

1741
01:54:53,686 --> 01:54:54,948
I know.

1742
01:54:56,556 --> 01:54:58,820
I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake.

1743
01:54:58,892 --> 01:55:01,520
You mean leaving his wife? Yeah.
I'm very happy for you.

1744
01:55:01,594 --> 01:55:02,925
I never thought he'd do it.

1745
01:55:02,996 --> 01:55:06,898
I told you all along.
See, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.

1746
01:55:06,966 --> 01:55:08,126
I guess so.

1747
01:55:08,201 --> 01:55:10,135
For that matter,
you were wrong about me, too.

1748
01:55:10,203 --> 01:55:13,263
What you said about those who take
and those who get took.

1749
01:55:13,339 --> 01:55:15,933
Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me.
I was using him.

1750
01:55:16,009 --> 01:55:19,843
See? Last month,
I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor.

1751
01:55:19,913 --> 01:55:23,542
Now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor,
paneled office, three windows.

1752
01:55:23,616 --> 01:55:26,915
So it all worked out fine.
We're both getting what we want.

1753
01:55:26,986 --> 01:55:29,784
Yes. You walking to the subway?

1754
01:55:29,856 --> 01:55:32,416
No, thank you. Well, I...

1755
01:55:32,492 --> 01:55:35,723
To tell you the truth,
I have this heavy date for tonight.

1756
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:38,955
Oh.

1757
01:55:39,032 --> 01:55:41,159
- Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
- No.

1758
01:55:41,234 --> 01:55:42,462
You know how people talk,

1759
01:55:42,535 --> 01:55:44,799
so I decided it would be better
if we didn't see each other

1760
01:55:44,871 --> 01:55:48,068
until after everything was settled,
divorce-wise.

1761
01:55:48,141 --> 01:55:49,631
That's very wise.

1762
01:55:51,144 --> 01:55:53,635
- Good night, Mr. Baxter.
- Good night.

1763
01:56:29,649 --> 01:56:31,583
Baxter, would you mind
stepping in here for a minute?

1764
01:56:31,651 --> 01:56:33,016
<i>BAXTER: Yes, Mr: Sheldrake: </i>

1765
01:56:33,086 --> 01:56:35,316
- There you are.
- Much obliged.

1766
01:56:37,223 --> 01:56:39,418
Here's a breakdown
of figures on personnel turnover.

1767
01:56:39,492 --> 01:56:43,019
37% of our female employees
leave to get married, and 22%...

1768
01:56:43,096 --> 01:56:44,427
Baxter, you're working too hard.

1769
01:56:44,497 --> 01:56:46,863
- It's New Year's Eve. Relax.
- Yes, sir.

1770
01:56:46,933 --> 01:56:49,333
Well, I suppose you'll be
out on the town tonight, celebrating.

1771
01:56:49,402 --> 01:56:51,427
- Naturally.
- Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out.

1772
01:56:51,504 --> 01:56:53,836
- I finally talked her into it.
- I see.

1773
01:56:53,906 --> 01:56:56,101
The only thing is, Baxter,
I'm staying at the athletic club,

1774
01:56:56,175 --> 01:56:59,144
and it's strictly stag,
so if you don't mind...

1775
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:02,838
Don't mind what?

1776
01:57:02,915 --> 01:57:04,906
You know, the other key
to your apartment.

1777
01:57:04,984 --> 01:57:07,077
Well, when we had that little scare
about Miss Kubelik,

1778
01:57:07,153 --> 01:57:08,484
I thought I'd better get rid of it quick,

1779
01:57:08,554 --> 01:57:11,216
so I threw it out the window
of the commuter train.

1780
01:57:11,290 --> 01:57:12,382
Very clever.

1781
01:57:12,458 --> 01:57:14,983
So now I'll have to borrow your key.

1782
01:57:16,195 --> 01:57:17,924
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.

1783
01:57:17,997 --> 01:57:19,089
What do you mean, sorry?

1784
01:57:19,165 --> 01:57:21,599
You're not going to bring
anybody to my apartment.

1785
01:57:21,667 --> 01:57:23,794
I'm not just bringing anybody,
I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.

1786
01:57:23,870 --> 01:57:26,168
Especially not Miss Kubelik.

1787
01:57:26,239 --> 01:57:28,537
- How's that again?
- No key.

1788
01:57:31,144 --> 01:57:33,009
Baxter, I picked you for my team

1789
01:57:33,079 --> 01:57:36,014
because I thought
you were a very bright young man.

1790
01:57:36,082 --> 01:57:39,540
Do you realize what you're doing?
Not to me, but to yourself?

1791
01:57:39,619 --> 01:57:43,111
Normally, it takes years to work
your way up to the twenty-seventh floor.

1792
01:57:43,189 --> 01:57:46,124
But it only takes 30 seconds
to be out on the street again.

1793
01:57:46,192 --> 01:57:47,523
You dig?

1794
01:57:48,261 --> 01:57:49,489
I dig.

1795
01:57:50,196 --> 01:57:52,187
So what's it going to be?

1796
01:57:59,038 --> 01:58:00,835
Now you're being bright.

1797
01:58:00,907 --> 01:58:02,397
Thank you, sir.

1798
01:58:19,559 --> 01:58:22,289
- Say, Baxter, you gave me the wrong key.
- No, I didn't.

1799
01:58:22,361 --> 01:58:24,989
This is the key to the executive washroom.

1800
01:58:25,064 --> 01:58:26,292
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake.

1801
01:58:26,365 --> 01:58:28,959
I won't be needing it
because I'm all washed up around here.

1802
01:58:29,035 --> 01:58:30,366
What's gotten into you, Baxter?

1803
01:58:30,436 --> 01:58:33,997
Just following doctor's orders.
I've decided to become a <i>mensch: </i>

1804
01:58:34,073 --> 01:58:36,837
You know what that means?
A human being.

1805
01:58:36,909 --> 01:58:38,740
- Now, hold on, Baxter...
- Save it.

1806
01:58:38,811 --> 01:58:40,938
The old payola won't work anymore.

1807
01:58:41,013 --> 01:58:42,913
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.

1808
01:59:12,612 --> 01:59:14,477
(DOORBELL RINGING)

1809
01:59:18,417 --> 01:59:21,511
Say, Baxter, we're having a little party.
We ran out of ice. I was wondering...

1810
01:59:21,587 --> 01:59:22,611
Sure, Doc.

1811
01:59:22,688 --> 01:59:24,918
How come you're alone
on New Year's Eve?

1812
01:59:24,991 --> 01:59:26,891
Well, I got things to do.

1813
01:59:26,959 --> 01:59:30,656
- What's this? You're packing?
- Yeah. I'm giving up the apartment.

1814
01:59:31,564 --> 01:59:33,225
Where are you moving to?

1815
01:59:33,299 --> 01:59:36,427
I don't know.
All I know is, I got to get out of this place.

1816
01:59:36,502 --> 01:59:38,561
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.

1817
01:59:38,638 --> 01:59:42,369
Me? You mean my body.
Don't worry, it'll go to the university, Doc.

1818
01:59:42,441 --> 01:59:43,703
I'll put it in writing.

1819
01:59:43,776 --> 01:59:46,802
- Could you use some champagne?
- Booze, we don't need.

1820
01:59:46,879 --> 01:59:48,813
Say, why don't you join us?

1821
01:59:48,881 --> 01:59:50,178
We got two brain surgeons,

1822
01:59:50,249 --> 01:59:52,649
an ear, nose and throat specialist,
a proctologist,

1823
01:59:52,718 --> 01:59:54,185
and three nurses from Bellevue.

1824
01:59:54,253 --> 01:59:55,948
No, thanks. I don't feel like it.

1825
01:59:56,022 --> 01:59:58,388
Look, Doc, in case I don't see you again,

1826
01:59:58,457 --> 02:00:00,652
how much do I owe you
for taking care of that girl?

1827
02:00:00,726 --> 02:00:04,526
Forget it. I didn't do it as a doctor.
I did it as a neighbor.

1828
02:00:04,597 --> 02:00:07,191
By the way, whatever happened to her?

1829
02:00:08,568 --> 02:00:11,469
You know me with girls.
Easy come, easy go.

1830
02:00:11,537 --> 02:00:13,095
Goodbye, Doc.

1831
02:00:13,172 --> 02:00:14,662
Happy New Year.

1832
02:00:43,202 --> 02:00:44,931
(CHATTERING)

1833
02:00:57,617 --> 02:00:59,847
Sorry I took so long on the phone,
but we're all set.

1834
02:00:59,919 --> 02:01:02,547
- All set for what?
- I rented a car. It'll be here at 1:00.

1835
02:01:02,622 --> 02:01:05,523
- We're driving down to Atlantic City.
- Atlantic City?

1836
02:01:05,591 --> 02:01:07,650
Oh, I know it's a drag,
but you can't find a hotel room in town.

1837
02:01:07,727 --> 02:01:09,661
Not on New Year's Eve.

1838
02:01:11,397 --> 02:01:15,595
Ring out the old year, ring in the new.
Ring-a-ding-ding.

1839
02:01:17,036 --> 02:01:20,472
I didn't plan it this way, Fran.
Actually, it's all Baxter's fault.

1840
02:01:20,539 --> 02:01:21,597
Baxter?

1841
02:01:21,674 --> 02:01:24,609
He wouldn't give me the key
to the apartment.

1842
02:01:25,378 --> 02:01:27,972
- He wouldn't?
- He just walked out on me. Quit.

1843
02:01:28,047 --> 02:01:30,777
Threw that big fat job right in my face.

1844
02:01:32,685 --> 02:01:34,016
The nerve.

1845
02:01:34,086 --> 02:01:36,611
Yeah, that little punk.
After all I did for him.

1846
02:01:36,689 --> 02:01:38,486
Said I couldn't
bring anybody to the apartment,

1847
02:01:38,557 --> 02:01:40,684
especially not Miss Kubelik.

1848
02:01:41,260 --> 02:01:43,387
What's he got against you, anyway?

1849
02:01:44,263 --> 02:01:46,231
I don't know.

1850
02:01:46,299 --> 02:01:49,757
I guess that's the way it crumbles,
cookie-wise.

1851
02:01:52,004 --> 02:01:54,131
What are you talking about?

1852
02:01:55,574 --> 02:01:58,600
I'd spell it out for you, only I can't spell.

1853
02:02:03,883 --> 02:02:09,082
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

1854
02:02:09,155 --> 02:02:14,252
<i>And never brought to mind</i>

1855
02:02:15,294 --> 02:02:16,852
Happy New Year, Fran.

1856
02:02:16,929 --> 02:02:19,454
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

1857
02:02:19,532 --> 02:02:24,731
<i>And days o'auld lang syne</i>

1858
02:02:24,804 --> 02:02:29,969
<i>For auld lang syne, my dear</i>

1859
02:02:30,042 --> 02:02:35,207
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

1860
02:02:35,281 --> 02:02:40,685
<i>We'll take a cup o'kindness yet</i>

1861
02:02:40,753 --> 02:02:46,521
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

1862
02:02:46,826 --> 02:02:50,159
(CHEERING)

1863
02:02:57,970 --> 02:02:59,130
Fran?

1864
02:03:01,207 --> 02:03:02,799
Where are you, Fran?

1865
02:03:18,924 --> 02:03:20,152
(LOUD BANG)

1866
02:03:21,494 --> 02:03:22,961
Mr. Baxter!

1867
02:03:23,829 --> 02:03:25,319
Mr. Baxter!

1868
02:03:25,398 --> 02:03:28,629
Mr. Baxter! Mr. Baxter!

1869
02:03:31,303 --> 02:03:32,292
Oh.

1870
02:03:32,872 --> 02:03:35,340
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

1871
02:03:36,142 --> 02:03:38,440
Are you sure? How's your knee?

1872
02:03:39,412 --> 02:03:41,175
I'm fine all over.

1873
02:03:43,582 --> 02:03:46,278
- Mind if I come in?
- Of course not.

1874
02:03:50,623 --> 02:03:52,614
Let me get another glass.

1875
02:03:55,628 --> 02:03:56,890
Where are you going?

1876
02:03:56,962 --> 02:04:00,728
Who knows? Another neighborhood,
another town, another job.

1877
02:04:01,333 --> 02:04:02,925
I'm on my own.

1878
02:04:03,736 --> 02:04:05,636
That's funny. So am I.

1879
02:04:07,173 --> 02:04:10,142
- What did you do with the cards?
- In there.

1880
02:04:22,755 --> 02:04:25,087
What about Mr. Sheldrake?

1881
02:04:25,157 --> 02:04:28,354
I'm going to send him a fruitcake
every Christmas.

1882
02:04:30,663 --> 02:04:31,721
Cut.

1883
02:04:34,366 --> 02:04:36,391
I love you, Miss Kubelik.

1884
02:04:36,902 --> 02:04:39,530
Three. Queen.

1885
02:04:40,239 --> 02:04:44,175
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik?
I absolutely adore you.

1886
02:04:46,946 --> 02:04:48,607
Shut up and deal.
