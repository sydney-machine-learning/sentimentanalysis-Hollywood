00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:06,508
Don Corleone,

3
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:10,678
I need your help. And not just
to light a little candle.

4
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:19,228
My gift was to be able to persuade
people to give to the Holy Church.

5
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:24,942
Then Rome decides to put me
in charge of the Vatican Bank...

6
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:30,115
...but I was never a true banker.

7
00:01:33,243 --> 00:01:37,371
Mea culpa. I trusted my friends.

8
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:40,751
Friendship and money...

9
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,712
Oil and water...

10
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:45,047
Indeed.

11
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:52,346
But these "friends" used the good name
of the Church to feed their greed.

12
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:55,681
If money was lost...

13
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:59,144
...then I am to blame.

14
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:06,192
If only prayer could pay off
our 700 million dollar deficit.

15
00:02:08,404 --> 00:02:10,572
769 million...

16
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:21,667
The Church owns 25 percent
of a large corporation. Immobiliare.

17
00:02:22,668 --> 00:02:24,753
You know the one I mean?

18
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:29,298
Largest landlord on Earth.
Real estate worth six billion dollars.

19
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,554
That's true.

20
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:37,890
And the Vatican vote
is necessary for control.

21
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:43,272
No, you're mistaken.

22
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:48,277
This isn't a question of one person
deciding. One deciding vote.

23
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:54,199
This is like any other company.
We have directors and very old rules.

24
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,204
The Pope himself
would have to approve you.

25
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,169
We've sold the casinos.

26
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,758
All businesses having to do
with gambling.

27
00:03:11,883 --> 00:03:17,472
We have no interests or investments
in anything illegitimate.

28
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,685
The Corleones are prepared to deposit

29
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,188
500 million dollars
in the Vatican Bank

30
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:29,026
when Mr. Corleone receives
majority control of Immobiliare.

31
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:34,073
Immobiliare could be something new.
A European conglomerate.

32
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:39,620
Few families have control
of such a company.

33
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:45,417
It seems, in today's world,

34
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:50,255
the power to absolve debt is greater
than the power of forgiveness.

35
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:54,383
600 million dollars.

36
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:02,476
Don't overestimate
the power of forgiveness.

37
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:06,646
Don Corleone,

38
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:09,066
this deal with Immobiliare

39
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,359
can make you
one of the richest men in the world.

40
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:15,239
Your whole past history,
and the history of your family,

41
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,950
and your children
would be washed away.

42
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:23,205
600 million.

43
00:04:40,263 --> 00:04:43,391
The only wealth
in this world is children.

44
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:46,395
More than all the money
and power on earth,

45
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:49,982
you are my treasure.

46
00:04:51,566 --> 00:04:53,901
Although I entrusted your education
to your mother

47
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:55,696
for your own best interest,

48
00:04:55,778 --> 00:04:58,281
I look forward to seeing you,

49
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,410
and to a new period of harmony
in our lives.

50
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:06,831
Perhaps you might prevail upon your
mother to come to this celebration.

51
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:56,256
Vincent, our name is not on the list.

52
00:05:58,842 --> 00:06:02,888
Write it in. Mancini. M-A-N-C-I-N-I.

53
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,934
- Problem?
- My name isn't on the list.

54
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:11,854
- Then you have to leave immediately.
- You want to dance with me?

55
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:15,109
Joe, it's Vinnie.
These are our guests.

56
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:17,318
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir.

57
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:19,655
Welcome to the party.

58
00:07:08,202 --> 00:07:12,499
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you. This is my husband.

59
00:07:12,582 --> 00:07:14,834
- Sit down.
- My son, Anthony.

60
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:20,798
The Order of Saint Sebastian is one of
the highest honors the Church awards.

61
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:23,217
It was first granted by Pope...

62
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:26,638
What about Mr. Corleone's connections
with gambling?

63
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:28,806
The press kits have...

64
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:31,185
What about his involvement
with the underworld?

65
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:32,436
Cut the crap.

66
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:36,190
The Pope, the Holy Father himself,

67
00:07:36,273 --> 00:07:40,985
has today blessed Michael Corleone.
Do you know better than the Pope?

68
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,989
Vincent! She loves you.

69
00:07:45,114 --> 00:07:46,783
Yeah?

70
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:52,247
I love you too.

71
00:07:58,336 --> 00:08:01,255
Hi, Vincent. I remember you.

72
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:07,054
- From where?
- The last party we were at together.

73
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:10,306
- Did you come to the club?
- No, it was a wedding.

74
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:15,186
I was eight and you were 15.

75
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:19,358
I had many girlfriends when I was 15.

76
00:08:19,483 --> 00:08:21,568
- Eight-year-olds?
- Especially them.

77
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:26,156
Where's Mary?

78
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:31,202
Would somebody please hail Mary?
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

79
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:35,249
You haven't kissed me hello yet.
Relatives always kiss.

80
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:39,002
- Now we're related?
- I'm your little cousin.

81
00:08:46,844 --> 00:08:49,888
- Who's your father?
- I'll give you a hint.

82
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:52,891
He's Italian.

83
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:56,311
Mary, we've been waiting for you.

84
00:08:56,394 --> 00:09:00,691
Remember to keep your voice low.

85
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:03,234
And smile. Don't forget to smile.

86
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,999
Daddy, Iâ€™m so nervous.

87
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:27,801
The honorary chairman of
the Vito Corleone Foundation,

88
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:30,095
my daughter, Mary Corleone.

89
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:41,355
Thanks.

90
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:47,653
I think I inherited my father's love
for speechmaking. Here it goes.

91
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:53,994
The Vito Corleone Foundation helps
the poor in every country,

92
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:58,165
gives grants to artists,
funds medical research,

93
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:03,087
and is particularly dedicated
to the resurrection of Sicily.

94
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:05,881
Archbishop Gilday,

95
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:10,510
here is 100 million dollars
for the poor of Sicily,

96
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:12,304
in the name of Vito Corleone.

97
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,306
Don't spend it all in one place.

98
00:10:33,325 --> 00:10:38,497
Mary, I'm so proud of you.

99
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:47,214
Michael...

100
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:50,133
You've done a wonderful thing
for Sicily.

101
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:54,680
Let's hope that the money gets
to the people who need it.

102
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:56,013
Amen.

103
00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:01,227
...the most important part:
Johnny Fontane!

104
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,073
Thank you very much.
I'm happy to be here.

105
00:11:13,197 --> 00:11:14,949
I would like you to join me

106
00:11:15,032 --> 00:11:18,579
in honoring
Commendatore Michael Corleone.

107
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:26,419
I have something special
for our godfather.

108
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:31,049
I happen to know his favorite song.
Michael, where are you going?

109
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:34,845
I'm off to the kitchen
to hear some Tony Bennett records.

110
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,639
Your favorite song, "Salsiccia's Own."

111
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:41,852
I'm having a salsiccia sandwich.
I'll be back.

112
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:17,804
Hello, Kay.

113
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:31,109
Congratulations, Michael.
That's quite an honor.

114
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:34,278
But a little expensive,
wouldn't you say?

115
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:40,119
- Cake?
- No, thank you.

116
00:12:53,965 --> 00:12:57,260
- It's been a long time, hasn't it?
- Yeah.

117
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,263
- Eight years.
- Yeah.

118
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:01,931
You look wonderful.

119
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,187
Your son has something
he wants to talk to you about.

120
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:10,148
I came here for him.

121
00:13:44,975 --> 00:13:50,354
- What's wrong with being a lawyer?
- He wants his life to be in music.

122
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:56,611
Music is great, I love music.
But he should finish what he started.

123
00:13:56,695 --> 00:13:58,071
Anthony...

124
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:01,115
- I'm going my own way.
- Your own way?

125
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:03,952
- Professional singer?
- Yes.

126
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:07,205
What happens if you fail?

127
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:10,458
- I won't fail.
- Men always believe that.

128
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:14,754
A law degree is like taking
out insurance.

129
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:19,426
- After that you can work for me...
- I will never work for you.

130
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:22,554
I have bad memories.

131
00:14:24,348 --> 00:14:26,850
Every family has bad memories.

132
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:32,773
I'll always be your son,

133
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:34,857
but won't have anything to do
with your business.

134
00:14:37,735 --> 00:14:41,155
Anthony... finish the law degree.

135
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,908
No.

136
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:05,346
Well, that he got from you. That "no."

137
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:13,688
- You could've helped me convince him.
- Convince him of what?

138
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,566
Of what?

139
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:21,155
He throws his life away.
He throws greatness away.

140
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:23,657
This is greatness?

141
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:29,662
Now that you're so respectable,
you're more dangerous than ever.

142
00:15:29,787 --> 00:15:33,833
I preferred you when you were
just a common Mafia hood.

143
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,294
Okay.

144
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:40,923
- Can we talk common sense here?
- All right.

145
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:50,141
Tony knows that you killed Fredo.

146
00:15:56,857 --> 00:16:00,277
- What did you come here for?
- To protect my son.

147
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:05,323
Not to see you disguised by your
church. That was a shameful ceremony.

148
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:12,538
I spent my life protecting my son.

149
00:16:13,165 --> 00:16:16,667
I spent my life protecting my family!

150
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:18,837
Let's be reasonable, okay?

151
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,423
That's your big thing,
isn't it, Michael?

152
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:24,718
Reason,

153
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:28,888
- backed up by murder.
- Oh, God.

154
00:16:30,682 --> 00:16:34,144
- You hate me. You hate me.
- No.

155
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:36,020
I don't hate you.

156
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:39,483
I dread you.

157
00:16:43,404 --> 00:16:45,656
I did what I could, Kay,

158
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:49,575
to protect all of you
from the horrors of this world.

159
00:16:50,953 --> 00:16:53,122
But you became my horror.

160
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:06,260
The children still love you, though.
Especially Mary.

161
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:11,098
That's something.

162
00:17:13,516 --> 00:17:17,019
We can build on that. For their sake,

163
00:17:21,023 --> 00:17:22,400
let's try.

164
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:28,448
Only if you let Tony go free to have
his own life, away from you.

165
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,499
I'll let Tony go.

166
00:17:40,084 --> 00:17:41,586
Thank you.

167
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,331
- Hi.
- Hi.

168
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:25,630
You could hurt somebody with those.
Let me show you around.

169
00:18:25,714 --> 00:18:28,050
Can you get me an interview
with Corleone?

170
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:30,760
No. I'm a relative,
but I can't do that.

171
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,345
What else can I do for you?

172
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:36,767
- Handsome, but useless.
- Oh, yeah?

173
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,686
- That's okay, I'll gamble.
- Do you like to gamble?

174
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,648
Let's go to Atlantic City.
I'll show you how to gamble.

175
00:18:43,773 --> 00:18:46,318
How do I know what numbers to bet?

176
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:48,528
Do I look like a guy who's gonna lose?

177
00:18:48,654 --> 00:18:49,863
Well...

178
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:54,534
Spooky-looking guy there.

179
00:18:55,494 --> 00:19:00,165
- What's a guy like that doing here?
- That's Joey Zasa's bulldog.

180
00:19:00,248 --> 00:19:02,333
- You know him?
- Yeah, I do.

181
00:19:03,252 --> 00:19:07,673
His name is Anthony Squigilaro.
They call him "The Ant."

182
00:19:08,298 --> 00:19:10,801
He dips his bullets in cyanide.

183
00:19:19,642 --> 00:19:21,227
Don Altobello.

184
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,150
- I've come to pay my respects.
- Grazie.

185
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:32,196
You honor my father's friendship.

186
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:34,366
Where is my goddaughter?

187
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:38,412
- Constanza!
- Don Altobello.

188
00:19:38,995 --> 00:19:43,458
It was not so long ago
that I held you in these old hands.

189
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:57,097
Michael, I've lost all the venom,
all the juice of youth.

190
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:02,351
I've lost the lust for women,
and now my mind is clear.

191
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:09,443
My duty to God is clear.
I have a special favor to ask of you.

192
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:17,951
Can I attach my name
to the Vito Corleone Foundation,

193
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:23,665
so that you and I can be joined
in name and spirit?

194
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:31,131
- One million dollars.
- A lot of money...

195
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:37,805
- Godfather.
- Don Altobello, you have such a heart.

196
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:45,103
Come, let's go and sample
some of that old vino.

197
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:55,446
The Vatican knows nothing
about these shareholders.

198
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:56,740
Good.

199
00:20:56,823 --> 00:21:01,702
I have a tendency to worry. We've
increased our position substantially.

200
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:06,332
- Naturally, I worry.
- Stop worrying, we have an agreement.

201
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:10,294
Good. How do you think
I got this gray hair?

202
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:16,092
Two seconds... Thank you for your
contribution to the swimming-pool.

203
00:21:16,176 --> 00:21:20,388
We need your help on Sam Wallace's
candidacy for judgeship.

204
00:21:20,472 --> 00:21:23,100
- We can always use a good judge.
- Thanks.

205
00:21:23,183 --> 00:21:24,810
Andrew!

206
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:28,813
My godson Andrew Hagen.
My brother Tom's eldest boy.

207
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:33,444
He's been assistant to Bishop Breelan
for three years.

208
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:37,864
- Hopes to be assigned to the Vatican.
- Rome needs fine young priests.

209
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,993
His mother Teresa Hagen,
Bishop Gilday.

210
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:43,536
Honored to meet you.

211
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:46,540
Mr. Corleone. Hi. Grace Hamilton.

212
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:52,378
Vincent Mancini promised to tell you
about me. That maybe you'd see me.

213
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:55,799
- Did Vincent Mancini call about her?
- No.

214
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:58,885
You promised to stay out there, twice.

215
00:21:58,968 --> 00:22:00,136
I know.

216
00:22:01,346 --> 00:22:05,350
Joey Zasa showed up.
He's waiting in the lobby.

217
00:22:05,475 --> 00:22:09,812
He wants to personally
congratulate you. Show his respect.

218
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:14,859
- Do I have to see him?
- He says you're his patron.

219
00:22:18,446 --> 00:22:20,239
Hey, Vinnie!

220
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:23,869
- Who's your favorite aunt?
- You are.

221
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:30,083
Today I'll talk to Michael
about your little problem.

222
00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:34,088
If you'd warned me, I would have
worn a better suit.

223
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,466
The Meucci Association has elected you

224
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,177
Italian-American Man of the Year.

225
00:22:43,054 --> 00:22:44,430
Meucci...

226
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:48,936
Who's Meucci?

227
00:22:50,186 --> 00:22:56,193
The Italian-American who invented
the telephone, one year before Bell.

228
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:03,074
And this is the reason
you've come today?

229
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:11,457
I...

230
00:23:14,753 --> 00:23:17,130
I've got a stone in my shoe.

231
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:20,926
A two-bit punk who works for me.

232
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,347
The one who thinks
he's related to you.

233
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,934
A bastard.

234
00:23:32,937 --> 00:23:37,316
He's here. Vincent Mancini.
He's at the party.

235
00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:42,281
Bring him in.

236
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:46,159
I think it's good that we talk.

237
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:49,036
No, grazie.

238
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,790
I have a problem...

239
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:59,673
...and I want to find out if it is
my problem or your problem.

240
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,762
Your business is your business. I have
no interests or percentages from it.

241
00:24:06,472 --> 00:24:09,558
Good. Then it's my problem.

242
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:18,108
Michael, you know Vincent Mancini.
Sonny's boy.

243
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:23,321
- How are you, Mr. Corleone?
- How are you?

244
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:27,408
- Good. How are you? Good party.
- You like it?

245
00:24:27,493 --> 00:24:30,745
- Yes, I had to sneak in.
- You're dressed for it.

246
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:39,212
So, what's the trouble
between you and Mr. Joe Zasa?

247
00:24:41,506 --> 00:24:45,718
- Just trouble. I'll take care of it.
- That's foolish of you.

248
00:24:45,802 --> 00:24:50,724
Foolish of me? It's a little foolish
of this guy, don't you think? Right?

249
00:24:52,642 --> 00:24:55,853
- Right?
- Temper like his father...

250
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,815
Vincent...

251
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:05,406
Mr. Joe Zasa now owns what used to
be the Corleone business in New York.

252
00:25:05,488 --> 00:25:09,367
Out of kindness, he gave you
a job in his family.

253
00:25:09,451 --> 00:25:12,079
You took it against my advice.

254
00:25:12,204 --> 00:25:17,501
I offered you something better in the
legitimate world. You turned me down.

255
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:22,505
Now you both come to me with this bad
blood. What do you expect me to do?

256
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,092
- Am I a gangster?
- No...

257
00:25:26,176 --> 00:25:31,056
That was Papa's neighborhood.
Zasa runs it like a disgrace!

258
00:25:31,139 --> 00:25:35,393
- That's the past, Connie.
- I earned that territory.

259
00:25:35,476 --> 00:25:39,148
The Commission gave it to me
and you approved.

260
00:25:39,231 --> 00:25:40,273
Yes.

261
00:25:40,357 --> 00:25:45,154
I came for the party, not to ask
for help. I could kill this bastard.

262
00:25:45,236 --> 00:25:46,696
So kill him.

263
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,326
What does all this have to do with me?

264
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:56,622
Well, he goes behind your back,
saying "Fuck Michael Corleone."

265
00:25:56,706 --> 00:25:59,417
Say it to his face, one time!

266
00:26:00,878 --> 00:26:06,049
Mr. Corleone, all bastards are liars.
Shakespeare wrote poems about it.

267
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:09,135
What am I going to do with this guy?

268
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:20,104
Joey, if there's some guy
running around this city,

269
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:22,815
saying, "Fuck Michael Corleone"...

270
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:27,528
...what do we do
with a piece of shit like that?

271
00:26:29,865 --> 00:26:31,909
He's a fucking dog.

272
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:42,627
Yes, it's true.
If anyone would say such a thing,

273
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:46,090
they would not be a friend,
they would be a dog.

274
00:26:52,303 --> 00:26:58,476
- My interests don't conflict with his.
- You don't know how much they do.

275
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,020
Quiet, Vincent.

276
00:27:00,103 --> 00:27:02,313
He needs your support!

277
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:05,149
Don't let me work for this guy,
let me work for you.

278
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:11,281
As what? Tough guy? I don't need
tough guys. I need more lawyers.

279
00:27:14,576 --> 00:27:19,498
Since we have no conflicts or debts,
I accept your tribute.

280
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,706
I wish you well.

281
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:26,964
Vincent, make your peace
with Mr. Joe Zasa. Go on.

282
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:39,350
Bastardo...

283
00:27:45,189 --> 00:27:48,025
Vinnie, what's the matter with you?

284
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:50,070
Get him out of here.

285
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,824
Jesus Christ...

286
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:57,285
I told Connie
this wasn't the right time.

287
00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:58,536
Close it.

288
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:02,249
I know you're into Wall Street,
but you're still the final word.

289
00:28:02,331 --> 00:28:05,252
I want to protect you from these guys.
Your lawyers can't.

290
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:07,962
- But you can?
- Yeah, I can do that.

291
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,507
Why should I be afraid of Zasa?

292
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:14,927
You stop him from rising
in the Commission.

293
00:28:15,012 --> 00:28:18,389
I say we make him dead.
Give me the order, I'll do it.

294
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:20,016
- You'll do it?
- Yeah.

295
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:29,693
Maybe you should come with me
for a few weeks. See what happens.

296
00:28:30,151 --> 00:28:32,278
- Okay.
- See if you learn.

297
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:36,407
And we'll talk about your future.

298
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:39,828
I won't let you down.

299
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,337
It's about ready.

300
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:55,593
So, what happened?

301
00:28:55,676 --> 00:28:56,928
What happened?

302
00:28:57,012 --> 00:29:00,307
If I'm in a room with Zasa,
what happens? I bit his ear off.

303
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:02,642
Here we go. Watch the card.

304
00:29:05,436 --> 00:29:06,854
Hold it!

305
00:29:09,108 --> 00:29:10,900
- Vincent...
- Yeah.

306
00:29:10,984 --> 00:29:13,278
Take the picture with us.

307
00:29:20,744 --> 00:29:22,204
Nice jacket.

308
00:29:24,122 --> 00:29:26,667
Closer to the center, sir.

309
00:29:30,212 --> 00:29:31,797
Smile!

310
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:55,486
Godfather, this is the cake for you
and your family from Enzo the baker.

311
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,699
Do you want to do it?

312
00:30:44,953 --> 00:30:47,748
Cent'anni! Cent'anni!

313
00:31:47,474 --> 00:31:50,476
- Vincent?
- What do you want, sweetheart?

314
00:31:52,812 --> 00:31:54,480
Do you love me?

315
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,526
- Come on, go to bed.
- Come on, say it.

316
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:02,321
I love you.

317
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,950
I love you, too.

318
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:09,204
You've got a cat?

319
00:32:16,003 --> 00:32:18,880
Go get us some water, I'm thirsty.
Come on.

320
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,300
Come on.

321
00:32:28,724 --> 00:32:31,476
Well, I guess I know my place.

322
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:35,188
I can't believe
I'm actually doing this.

323
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,692
"Get me water, bake me a cake..."
What happened to "please"?

324
00:33:27,281 --> 00:33:30,118
Good boy, Sackface. Go for a walk.

325
00:33:39,545 --> 00:33:42,423
- Let her go.
- Cut her throat, man.

326
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:48,052
- What did you say?
- Cut her fucking throat.

327
00:33:51,181 --> 00:33:52,182
Okay, chief...

328
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:54,435
Drop your gun or he'll cut her throat.

329
00:33:54,518 --> 00:33:58,772
I hardly know her, so cut her.
What the fuck do I care?

330
00:34:00,732 --> 00:34:04,402
You've got no choice. She'll be dead.

331
00:34:04,485 --> 00:34:08,531
If you do, I'll kill you both.
Give up that knife, I'll let you go.

332
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:11,159
Cut her throat! Right now!

333
00:34:11,243 --> 00:34:13,536
I'll do something
that'll convince you.

334
00:34:13,578 --> 00:34:17,457
Don't get frightened. Just watch me.

335
00:34:22,295 --> 00:34:23,880
Oh, shit!

336
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:28,426
Drop the knife. Drop it!

337
00:34:28,509 --> 00:34:30,511
Good boy.

338
00:34:30,596 --> 00:34:35,266
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
It was a wise choice. Sit down.

339
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,893
Lose the mask.

340
00:34:40,272 --> 00:34:42,648
Relax, have a smoke. You smoke?

341
00:34:45,402 --> 00:34:47,987
Whose idea was this? Who sent you?

342
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:51,657
Tell me who sent you.

343
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:56,662
- No one.
- Did you take a look at this guy?

344
00:34:56,746 --> 00:34:58,790
- Yeah.
- Who sent you?

345
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:03,836
It was Joey Zasa.

346
00:35:18,518 --> 00:35:20,145
Are you okay?

347
00:35:23,357 --> 00:35:26,527
- You were going to let them kill me!
- No, I wasn't...

348
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,196
You pig! You sick fuck!

349
00:35:31,364 --> 00:35:34,993
You wanted gambling. That's gambling.
Call the police.

350
00:35:39,915 --> 00:35:43,293
- You killed the other guy too?
- He went for my gun.

351
00:35:44,085 --> 00:35:47,214
It was self-defense.
Go ahead, call the police.

352
00:35:48,464 --> 00:35:50,466
- No, no...
- I'm taking pictures.

353
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:52,177
No pictures.

354
00:35:54,054 --> 00:35:55,305
You had a gun!

355
00:35:55,721 --> 00:36:00,643
They only had a knife. You could have
handed them over to the police.

356
00:36:01,478 --> 00:36:04,523
Zasa sent them.
I just sent him a message.

357
00:36:05,732 --> 00:36:10,946
- Now he has to send you one back.
- Zasa is going to send me one back?

358
00:36:11,029 --> 00:36:13,907
He did the right thing.
He got Zasa's name!

359
00:36:13,991 --> 00:36:17,786
What has Joey Zasa to do
with anything? Joey Zasa is a pazzo.

360
00:36:21,456 --> 00:36:23,833
All right. You are what you are.

361
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:27,545
It's your nature. Stay close to me.

362
00:36:27,628 --> 00:36:31,759
Don't do anything. Keep your mouth
shut and your eyes open.

363
00:36:31,842 --> 00:36:34,720
- And you do what I tell you.
- I understand.

364
00:36:34,802 --> 00:36:38,098
- I have problems with the Commission.
- I know.

365
00:36:38,181 --> 00:36:42,935
- You don't make them easier.
- It wasn't my idea that this happened.

366
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:46,272
- Get out of here.
- Michael...

367
00:36:46,982 --> 00:36:48,192
Yes?

368
00:36:50,027 --> 00:36:53,739
- Now they'll fear you.
- Maybe they should fear you.

369
00:36:57,701 --> 00:37:01,580
- B.J., what's up?
- The Archbishop just called back.

370
00:37:01,663 --> 00:37:04,291
We've arranged some amazing things.

371
00:37:04,373 --> 00:37:06,250
The publicity is phenomenal.

372
00:37:06,335 --> 00:37:08,545
You're the new Rockefeller.
A philanthropist.

373
00:37:11,047 --> 00:37:14,258
- Sign here, please.
- Times do change, don't they?

374
00:37:14,927 --> 00:37:19,473
My father hated foundations.
He loved doing it by himself.

375
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:23,101
Man to man. But we're different.

376
00:37:23,185 --> 00:37:26,355
No different than
any large corporation.

377
00:37:26,438 --> 00:37:28,773
We control a lot of money with little.

378
00:37:28,857 --> 00:37:33,320
Minimize taxes.
With no government control.

379
00:37:42,286 --> 00:37:44,831
- Godfather.
- Andrew.

380
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:51,505
- Off to Rome...
- I wanted to thank you for everything.

381
00:37:52,047 --> 00:37:55,092
- Do you want some breakfast?
- Thanks, I can't.

382
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:59,596
- How's your Italian?
- Devo fare un po' di pratica.

383
00:38:00,889 --> 00:38:03,142
- His father was a great lawyer.
- I know.

384
00:38:03,225 --> 00:38:05,893
Didn't live to see him ordained.
I did.

385
00:38:05,978 --> 00:38:07,938
Did you ever see one of those?

386
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,441
Beautiful. I was so proud.
Let me walk you out.

387
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,446
If you hear any rumors in the Vatican,
let me know.

388
00:38:15,529 --> 00:38:18,072
No, Andrew has the true faith.

389
00:38:20,993 --> 00:38:25,080
The motion under discussion
relates to Corleone Group's proposal

390
00:38:26,498 --> 00:38:31,086
to acquire 100,000,000 newly issued
Class A voting shares.

391
00:38:34,047 --> 00:38:38,886
...Corleone capital invested directly
into International Immobiliare,

392
00:38:40,052 --> 00:38:43,473
an old and respected
European company.

393
00:38:44,308 --> 00:38:47,186
Mr. Corleone has
an ambitious program

394
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,896
to expand this real estate company

395
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,983
into an international conglomerate...

396
00:38:55,819 --> 00:39:01,949
...by Eastern techniques of efficiency
and focus and unlimited...

397
00:39:02,034 --> 00:39:04,078
Mr. Corleone, excuse me.

398
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:07,955
Didn't you recently deposit
200 million in the Vatican Bank,

399
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,293
which is affiliated with Immobiliare?

400
00:39:11,585 --> 00:39:13,045
True. Why not?

401
00:39:13,127 --> 00:39:19,592
Wasn't there any questioning about
the timing on this particular deposit?

402
00:39:19,676 --> 00:39:21,844
Mr. Chairman, if I may?

403
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:27,893
The Vito Andolini Corleone Foundation,
of which Mary Corleone is chairman,

404
00:39:28,018 --> 00:39:31,438
has made an endowment
of 100 million dollars.

405
00:39:31,522 --> 00:39:33,773
The money comes from his own family

406
00:39:33,857 --> 00:39:35,859
and will be administered
by the Vatican.

407
00:39:35,942 --> 00:39:38,319
Does that answer your question?

408
00:39:38,487 --> 00:39:44,201
My fellow shareholders, if Europe
and America can learn to co-operate,

409
00:39:44,326 --> 00:39:48,539
if we can learn to pool our wealth,
share our markets,

410
00:39:48,663 --> 00:39:53,209
we can defeat any competition
anywhere in the world.

411
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:56,587
Thank you for your time.

412
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:01,427
I hope that you will look favorably
on my proposal. Thank you.

413
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:06,598
Let me have this microphone here.

414
00:40:06,681 --> 00:40:09,560
Will we let a criminal
run our company?

415
00:40:09,643 --> 00:40:11,853
He's got the map of Sicily
on his face!

416
00:40:11,936 --> 00:40:13,020
Order!

417
00:40:13,105 --> 00:40:15,565
He's either a Catholic or a mafioso...

418
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:18,694
Mr. Chairman...

419
00:40:19,194 --> 00:40:24,282
...the Vatican Bank feels
that International Immobiliare...

420
00:40:24,366 --> 00:40:28,078
...will be safe
in Mr. Corleone's hands.

421
00:40:28,911 --> 00:40:32,040
...subject to audit
and final ratification,

422
00:40:32,123 --> 00:40:33,792
which must take place in Rome.

423
00:40:34,168 --> 00:40:37,503
Please join me in welcoming
Mr. Michael Corleone.

424
00:40:47,848 --> 00:40:51,351
Mary, this is real.
This foundation is real.

425
00:40:54,313 --> 00:40:56,523
I wanted Anthony to be part of it.

426
00:40:56,607 --> 00:40:59,317
I thought
you would be together on this.

427
00:40:59,442 --> 00:41:03,906
I won't interfere.
I'll help, but only if you ask.

428
00:41:04,031 --> 00:41:05,991
What is this really for?

429
00:41:06,866 --> 00:41:10,036
Why are you doing this?
Why am I doing this?

430
00:41:11,913 --> 00:41:16,502
I'm doing this for my children.
You're doing it for your children too.

431
00:41:17,502 --> 00:41:20,630
This foundation is supposed to
help all people.

432
00:41:20,714 --> 00:41:23,092
That's the purpose.

433
00:41:23,174 --> 00:41:27,720
This is legitimate.
Mary, I swear, this is legitimate.

434
00:41:32,016 --> 00:41:34,977
Dad, I want this to bring me
closer to you.

435
00:41:43,444 --> 00:41:47,198
I would burn in hell to keep you safe.

436
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:04,675
Go in the other car.
I'll ride with Michael.

437
00:42:04,757 --> 00:42:06,384
Go, go, go.

438
00:42:20,022 --> 00:42:24,819
Your old partners are grateful for
the money you made them.

439
00:42:24,902 --> 00:42:26,738
They worship you...

440
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:33,578
...but their hearts are broken,
because they think you abandoned them.

441
00:42:34,413 --> 00:42:40,668
They want to share your deal
on Immobiliare, to be a family again.

442
00:42:40,752 --> 00:42:43,254
It can purify their money.

443
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,342
This I cannot do.

444
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:53,055
Immobiliare must be legitimate.

445
00:42:55,516 --> 00:42:56,726
I know.

446
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:59,855
But they're unhappy.

447
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,275
And you?

448
00:43:04,275 --> 00:43:09,739
I ask nothing for myself.
Only peace in my old age.

449
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:13,409
But I must please the world around me.

450
00:43:15,536 --> 00:43:21,417
Michael, your father was
a reasonable man. Learn from him.

451
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,090
I learnt many things from my father.

452
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:38,226
Call a meeting, my friend,
so there are no debts or grudges.

453
00:43:39,435 --> 00:43:42,271
We will make the peace, you and I.

454
00:43:59,706 --> 00:44:02,501
The Vatican announced today...

455
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,462
that Pope Paul VI has canceled his
Sunday blessing...

456
00:44:06,755 --> 00:44:08,465
due to ill health.

457
00:44:08,674 --> 00:44:11,552
His physician has ordered total bedrest...

458
00:44:11,884 --> 00:44:14,513
and cessation of all activities.

459
00:44:22,186 --> 00:44:24,188
They've had a press conference.

460
00:44:24,272 --> 00:44:27,442
The Pope's condition
is grave. "Gravissimo."

461
00:44:56,804 --> 00:45:00,100
The purpose of this meeting
is to ratify...

462
00:45:00,476 --> 00:45:03,854
the motion passed by our
shareholders in New York.

463
00:45:05,272 --> 00:45:06,565
Please...

464
00:45:07,523 --> 00:45:12,112
Our group represents a consortium
of Catholic businessmen

465
00:45:12,196 --> 00:45:15,114
against the Corleone control.

466
00:45:16,074 --> 00:45:18,368
The Vatican has cast its vote.

467
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:21,370
Corleone Group
already controls the Board.

468
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:23,123
According to the Lateran Treaty,

469
00:45:23,206 --> 00:45:26,000
the Vatican vote
must be ratified here.

470
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:28,252
Here in Rome, by the Pope.

471
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,426
The Pope is gravely ill.

472
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:40,474
Until he recovers, I am powerless.

473
00:45:41,766 --> 00:45:44,477
- What if he dies?
- Then...

474
00:45:45,603 --> 00:45:48,648
...as you Americans say,
all bets are off.

475
00:45:49,148 --> 00:45:51,109
Gentlemen, please.

476
00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:55,864
This is a brief delay. Nothing more.

477
00:46:00,911 --> 00:46:03,246
Your Excellency, gentlemen...

478
00:46:04,581 --> 00:46:09,795
I advise you to join us in our prayers
for the Holy Father's recovery.

479
00:46:11,212 --> 00:46:12,880
We had an agreement!

480
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:18,094
This meeting was to be
merely a formality.

481
00:46:18,177 --> 00:46:23,475
- Please sit down.
- I'd rather stand. Give me an answer.

482
00:46:23,558 --> 00:46:29,063
The Immobiliare has its roots in the
European tradition. Please understand.

483
00:46:29,857 --> 00:46:33,235
I understand.
Your tactics are despicable.

484
00:46:33,317 --> 00:46:36,446
That's quite an indictment,
coming from a Corleone.

485
00:46:36,572 --> 00:46:40,868
- Gentlemen, gentlemen!
- Remember you are in the Vatican.

486
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:50,460
- What is it that you want?
- Yes, you will take control.

487
00:46:51,587 --> 00:46:55,047
We'll gladly put you at the helm
of our little fleet,

488
00:46:55,632 --> 00:46:59,427
but our ships must all sail
in the same direction.

489
00:47:01,054 --> 00:47:06,601
Otherwise, who can say how long
your stay with us will last?

490
00:47:08,853 --> 00:47:14,734
It's not personal. It's only business.
You should know, Godfather.

491
00:47:18,781 --> 00:47:20,114
Very well.

492
00:47:21,491 --> 00:47:26,537
You want to do business with me?
I will do business with you.

493
00:47:27,538 --> 00:47:29,457
Vipers, all of them.

494
00:47:35,505 --> 00:47:38,549
- We're back with the Borgias!
- Uncle Michael...

495
00:47:38,634 --> 00:47:41,969
- Andrew!
- I heard you were here.

496
00:47:42,054 --> 00:47:45,599
It's so nice to see you.
Vincent, it's so nice.

497
00:47:46,475 --> 00:47:49,811
What is this about the Borgias?
Those days are over.

498
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:57,319
- Recognize it?
- Yeah.

499
00:47:58,987 --> 00:48:03,617
Genco Olive Oil. That's where our
grandfather started as a delivery boy.

500
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:07,495
Three years later he owned it.

501
00:48:07,578 --> 00:48:09,831
- Only in America.
- That's it.

502
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:15,963
Vincenzo, where have you been hiding?
We need your help so badly.

503
00:48:16,045 --> 00:48:17,547
What can I do for you?

504
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,715
Get rid of Joe Zasa. He sells drugs...

505
00:48:19,842 --> 00:48:24,847
Now that I'm an older woman,
I'm afraid to go out at night.

506
00:48:24,929 --> 00:48:27,265
Where should they be now?

507
00:48:27,348 --> 00:48:30,476
- Lou, what's going on?
- We're late.

508
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,189
- Have I ever let you down?
- I trust you.

509
00:48:35,273 --> 00:48:37,609
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

510
00:48:37,692 --> 00:48:39,444
Enjoy yourselves.

511
00:48:47,118 --> 00:48:48,995
The neighborhoodâ€™s in trouble.

512
00:48:49,705 --> 00:48:52,458
- Do you keep an eye out for them?
- Yes.

513
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,168
- And for me?
- From now on.

514
00:48:56,377 --> 00:49:00,381
- I've missed you all this time.
- I missed you too, cousin.

515
00:49:00,465 --> 00:49:03,259
I missed growing up with my cousins.

516
00:49:03,342 --> 00:49:05,178
I didn't even know you,
but missed you.

517
00:49:06,471 --> 00:49:11,141
Do you remember stories about
our fathers? The old days?

518
00:49:11,143 --> 00:49:13,520
Yeah, what do you want to know?

519
00:49:15,813 --> 00:49:21,152
- What was Sonny like?
- Well, he was the Prince of the City.

520
00:49:22,737 --> 00:49:26,407
He died before I was born,
but I've heard a lot about him.

521
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:31,705
- What about my father?
- He's a great man.

522
00:49:33,206 --> 00:49:35,583
He's a hero. He saved the family.

523
00:49:37,585 --> 00:49:39,337
- Vincent?
- What?

524
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,672
Did he kill his own brother?

525
00:49:45,969 --> 00:49:47,137
No.

526
00:49:49,681 --> 00:49:51,391
So, it's all lies?

527
00:49:55,978 --> 00:49:59,148
Just stories, sweetheart. Okay?

528
00:50:03,237 --> 00:50:04,530
Okay.

529
00:50:06,906 --> 00:50:10,243
- I'm glad you're around.
- I'm glad you're here too.

530
00:50:15,165 --> 00:50:16,667
Cugina...

531
00:50:17,668 --> 00:50:19,086
Cous...

532
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:36,811
I'd like to take Joey Zasa for a ride
in this and drop him.

533
00:50:36,936 --> 00:50:39,105
Joey Zasa is nothing.

534
00:50:39,982 --> 00:50:43,735
He's a small time enforcer.
He bluffs and threatens.

535
00:50:43,819 --> 00:50:47,614
He's nothing.
You can see him coming a mile away.

536
00:50:48,531 --> 00:50:51,159
- We should kill him before he...
- No!

537
00:50:54,371 --> 00:50:58,459
Never hate your enemies.
It affects your judgement.

538
00:51:14,766 --> 00:51:17,393
Nice to see you again, Mr. Corleone.

539
00:51:37,873 --> 00:51:40,208
Hey, girls. Let's go.

540
00:51:57,976 --> 00:52:02,356
We trusted you to manage
our money in the casinos.

541
00:52:02,438 --> 00:52:04,857
It's not even 20 years.

542
00:52:04,942 --> 00:52:08,362
You've sold the casinos
and made fortunes for all of us.

543
00:52:08,444 --> 00:52:10,655
Bravo, Don Corleone!

544
00:52:12,866 --> 00:52:14,284
Thank you.

545
00:52:15,243 --> 00:52:21,958
Friends, I have come here
because our business together is done.

546
00:52:23,627 --> 00:52:25,378
We have prospered,

547
00:52:25,462 --> 00:52:30,551
and now it is time for us to dissolve
the business relationship between us.

548
00:52:32,802 --> 00:52:34,346
That's it.

549
00:52:34,429 --> 00:52:37,683
But I do have a little surprise. Al?

550
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:42,937
Your shares in the casinos.

551
00:52:43,605 --> 00:52:45,440
I thought
I cut through all the red tape,

552
00:52:45,523 --> 00:52:47,609
so you could
get your money right away.

553
00:52:54,282 --> 00:52:56,659
50 million dollars!

554
00:52:56,743 --> 00:53:00,288
- Not everybody gets the same.
- Nothing for you...

555
00:53:00,371 --> 00:53:05,335
- It depends on your investment.
- Michael, this is really generous!

556
00:53:06,377 --> 00:53:07,795
Wonderful!

557
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:15,344
- Parisi, how much did you invest?
- I don't remember.

558
00:53:16,138 --> 00:53:17,848
You're blessed.

559
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:27,565
My family has done much of
the hard work, taken many risks.

560
00:53:29,817 --> 00:53:33,029
All to make money
for the rest of the families.

561
00:53:35,406 --> 00:53:37,450
You all know Joey Zasa.

562
00:53:38,409 --> 00:53:40,913
He is, I admit, an important man.

563
00:53:41,913 --> 00:53:45,625
His picture is on the cover
of the New York Times magazine.

564
00:53:46,293 --> 00:53:50,339
He gets the Esquire Magazine award
for the best dressed gangster.

565
00:53:51,507 --> 00:53:53,425
The newspapers praise him

566
00:53:53,549 --> 00:53:58,013
because he hires Blacks,
which shows he has a good heart.

567
00:54:00,641 --> 00:54:02,267
He is famous.

568
00:54:03,018 --> 00:54:09,190
Who knows? Maybe one day
he'll make all of you popular.

569
00:54:10,859 --> 00:54:12,027
It's true.

570
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:17,824
I make more of a bella figura.
That is my nature.

571
00:54:17,907 --> 00:54:22,996
But I also want to make a move
into legitimate enterprises.

572
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,748
I'd like a little pin from the Pope.

573
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:31,338
Sure, I take the Blacks
and the Spanish into my family,

574
00:54:31,422 --> 00:54:34,967
because that's America.

575
00:54:35,592 --> 00:54:38,971
And you guarantee
that they don't deal drugs?

576
00:54:40,806 --> 00:54:45,436
I don't guarantee that. I guarantee
that I'll kill anybody who does.

577
00:54:50,107 --> 00:54:55,237
- Let me talk to him.
- Who can refuse Don Altobello?

578
00:54:55,737 --> 00:54:58,072
- Joey, are you...
- No!

579
00:54:58,866 --> 00:55:04,246
I say to all of you, I have been
treated this day with no respect.

580
00:55:05,413 --> 00:55:07,415
I've earned you all money.

581
00:55:07,498 --> 00:55:10,877
I've made you rich
and I asked for little.

582
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,797
Good. You will not give, so I'll take!

583
00:55:16,132 --> 00:55:18,634
As for Don Corleone,

584
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:24,683
he makes it very clear to me today
that he is my enemy.

585
00:55:28,645 --> 00:55:30,855
You must choose between us.

586
00:55:34,067 --> 00:55:35,234
No, Joey!

587
00:55:37,737 --> 00:55:39,531
We could reason together.

588
00:55:39,614 --> 00:55:40,991
No.

589
00:55:42,326 --> 00:55:44,953
Michael, please...

590
00:55:48,956 --> 00:55:51,710
Michael, the news is everywhere.

591
00:55:52,585 --> 00:55:56,714
Everyone says that you
control Immobiliare.

592
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:01,844
Immobiliare is already laundering
money in Peru and Nassau.

593
00:56:03,096 --> 00:56:07,558
We've worked with you for 40 years.
We should wet our beaks a little.

594
00:56:07,643 --> 00:56:12,563
- We want to do business with you.
- That's right, we've been together...

595
00:56:22,616 --> 00:56:25,911
- It's a hit! Let's go!
- Let's get out of here! Move!

596
00:56:45,139 --> 00:56:47,641
My coat! It's my lucky coat!

597
00:56:48,808 --> 00:56:50,643
It's my lucky coat!

598
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:58,068
Stay behind me!

599
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,127
Mikey, this way!

600
00:57:37,523 --> 00:57:39,817
Come on. We're out of here.

601
00:58:12,266 --> 00:58:14,602
- You did good, Vincent.
- Grazie.

602
00:58:14,978 --> 00:58:18,190
The old Dons were pretty much
wiped out.

603
00:58:18,315 --> 00:58:21,610
The survivors made deals with Zasa.

604
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:25,071
- Altobello?
- He survived.

605
00:58:25,197 --> 00:58:27,907
He's with his daughters
in Staten Island.

606
00:58:27,991 --> 00:58:30,076
He says he's going to retire
in Sicily.

607
00:58:32,036 --> 00:58:36,500
Joey Zasa would never pull something
like this without the backing.

608
00:58:37,333 --> 00:58:43,005
He's just muscle. He doesn't have
the wit for that helicopter attack.

609
00:58:43,089 --> 00:58:47,468
He doesn't even have the ambition
to wipe out the whole Commission.

610
00:58:47,552 --> 00:58:50,304
I say we hit back and take Zasa out!

611
00:58:55,893 --> 00:58:58,897
Never let anyone know
what you're thinking.

612
00:59:06,904 --> 00:59:09,907
Let's get a message to Joey Zasa.

613
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,496
I respect what he's done.

614
00:59:16,623 --> 00:59:19,460
The new overthrows the old.
It's natural.

615
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,588
How can you do business with this guy?

616
00:59:25,047 --> 00:59:29,011
I'm a businessman, first and foremost.
I want no further conflict.

617
00:59:29,094 --> 00:59:31,764
Tell him that
he can live or he can die.

618
00:59:31,846 --> 00:59:33,514
Vincent, will you shut up!

619
00:59:52,116 --> 00:59:53,618
That's it.

620
00:59:55,871 --> 00:59:57,372
Joey Zasa...

621
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,417
He can't be doing this alone.

622
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:08,091
Just when I thought I was out,
they pull me back in.

623
01:00:16,808 --> 01:00:22,480
Our true enemy has not yet
shown his face.

624
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:28,112
Michael!

625
01:00:31,864 --> 01:00:33,783
It's his diabetes!

626
01:00:34,993 --> 01:00:38,580
- Has he had his medicine?
- I don't know what he took.

627
01:00:44,043 --> 01:00:46,337
- I've got my wind back.
- Call a doctor.

628
01:00:46,422 --> 01:00:48,382
- Run, run, run!
- Vincent!

629
01:00:48,507 --> 01:00:52,386
Run at thunder, girl!
Thunder can't hurt!

630
01:00:52,511 --> 01:00:54,513
Harmless noise!

631
01:00:55,304 --> 01:01:00,143
Bullshit! You deceitful old fuck!

632
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:03,479
Altobello, you fuck!

633
01:01:06,315 --> 01:01:07,567
Fredo!

634
01:01:08,527 --> 01:01:10,154
Fredo!

635
01:01:33,844 --> 01:01:36,263
Oh, God! Dad!

636
01:01:38,848 --> 01:01:40,516
Excuse me.

637
01:01:41,101 --> 01:01:42,728
I'll call Kay.

638
01:01:53,447 --> 01:01:57,159
- Good evening, sir.
- Can we wait here? We'll be back soon.

639
01:02:03,998 --> 01:02:09,921
Mr. Harrison, you said it was urgent.
Have you come to confess your sins?

640
01:02:10,505 --> 01:02:15,134
Michael Corleone has had a diabetic
stroke. I wanted you to know about it.

641
01:02:15,886 --> 01:02:20,974
He's in a coma. I'm here to insist
the deal goes through in any event.

642
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,018
The Pope has not much time left.

643
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:28,440
So, as you,
I am in a difficult position.

644
01:02:28,898 --> 01:02:32,110
We have to ratify this deal
as soon as possible.

645
01:02:32,985 --> 01:02:35,864
- We have an understanding.
- Good.

646
01:02:37,281 --> 01:02:40,868
- I'm going to the hospital.
- I'll pray for Mr. Corleone.

647
01:02:45,581 --> 01:02:49,252
- Our thoughts are with Mr. Corleone.
- Thank you, Father Jim.

648
01:02:52,005 --> 01:02:55,467
Everything will be out in the open
if Corleone dies.

649
01:02:57,094 --> 01:02:59,179
Play for time, Keinszig.

650
01:02:59,971 --> 01:03:04,308
A habit born of
a long contemplation of eternity.

651
01:03:41,138 --> 01:03:42,764
Hello, Michael.

652
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,393
It's Kay.

653
01:03:52,607 --> 01:03:53,816
Kay...

654
01:03:56,235 --> 01:03:58,279
I never expected you.

655
01:03:59,197 --> 01:04:01,366
No, I know.

656
01:04:03,826 --> 01:04:05,578
But I'm here.

657
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:11,543
- I'm glad.
- You know...

658
01:04:15,005 --> 01:04:17,465
I've never seen you
looking so helpless.

659
01:04:21,969 --> 01:04:24,013
It's not so bad, really.

660
01:04:26,016 --> 01:04:30,020
I feel... I'm getting wiser now.

661
01:04:30,603 --> 01:04:32,522
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

662
01:04:33,773 --> 01:04:35,859
The sicker you get, the wiser you get?

663
01:04:37,277 --> 01:04:39,321
When I'm dead, I'll be really smart.

664
01:04:41,197 --> 01:04:45,326
Michael... I want to thank you
for Tony.

665
01:04:48,621 --> 01:04:52,542
He's doing really well.
He's gotten some very good notices,

666
01:04:53,043 --> 01:04:55,128
and he'll make his operatic debut

667
01:04:55,212 --> 01:04:58,172
in Sicily, in Palermo
this Easter, so...

668
01:05:00,174 --> 01:05:01,217
So, thank you.

669
01:05:03,052 --> 01:05:06,013
That's a real honor. In Sicily.

670
01:05:11,185 --> 01:05:14,063
I will be there. I won't miss that.

671
01:05:14,897 --> 01:05:16,733
I won't miss that.

672
01:05:23,114 --> 01:05:25,408
Mary, Tony...

673
01:05:26,909 --> 01:05:28,453
Go see Dad.

674
01:05:34,585 --> 01:05:37,795
- Sweetheart!
- Everything's going to be all right.

675
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:40,965
- Tony!
- How are you doing, Pop?

676
01:05:43,427 --> 01:05:46,555
Your mother told me what happened.

677
01:05:46,679 --> 01:05:49,640
About Palermo? I hope you'll be there.

678
01:05:49,725 --> 01:05:52,060
Of course. Kiss me.

679
01:06:12,331 --> 01:06:16,668
- Cousin Vinnie?
- He's not here. Call his apartment.

680
01:06:18,712 --> 01:06:21,297
- It's your cousin Mary.
- Let her in.

681
01:06:25,969 --> 01:06:30,139
Hi, cous. I thought I'd drop by.
Is that okay?

682
01:06:30,264 --> 01:06:32,141
I'll get the guys.

683
01:06:33,893 --> 01:06:37,105
No, it's not okay.
You shouldn't have come, Mary.

684
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,818
Only a couple of minutes, okay?

685
01:06:42,277 --> 01:06:45,321
- You look beautiful, cous.
- Thanks.

686
01:06:48,282 --> 01:06:50,869
So this is your club, your hideout?

687
01:06:51,536 --> 01:06:54,248
- Yeah.
- I came here to check it out.

688
01:06:59,378 --> 01:07:03,382
It's so strange, just me
and Aunt Connie in the house.

689
01:07:03,507 --> 01:07:07,678
- I feel better when I'm with you.
- What's wrong, sweetheart?

690
01:07:08,344 --> 01:07:11,139
- I'm scared about my father.
- Don't be.

691
01:07:11,264 --> 01:07:15,102
When they took him out of
the ambulance, I thought he was dead.

692
01:07:15,185 --> 01:07:18,021
Everybody says
he's going to be better.

693
01:07:20,022 --> 01:07:21,650
Don't worry.

694
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:25,028
I remember a shooting
when I was little.

695
01:07:26,029 --> 01:07:30,909
And one time Al Neri and other
bodyguards took me and Tony away.

696
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:35,121
Is it all happening again?

697
01:07:36,749 --> 01:07:38,709
Not like that, sweetie.

698
01:07:40,209 --> 01:07:44,047
Then why are you hiding here?
Is something going to happen to you?

699
01:07:45,923 --> 01:07:49,886
Nothing's going to happen
to me, cugina. We'll take care of you.

700
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:02,816
Can I stay here and hide out with you?

701
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:05,569
Can you help me cook for the boys?

702
01:08:05,694 --> 01:08:09,406
You know that I don't know
how to cook, but I'll help.

703
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:23,753
Okay...

704
01:08:24,629 --> 01:08:26,214
What do I do?

705
01:08:58,539 --> 01:09:01,458
- I love you, cous.
- I love you, too, cous.

706
01:09:05,337 --> 01:09:06,922
Let us cook.

707
01:09:23,813 --> 01:09:25,148
Hold me.

708
01:10:02,018 --> 01:10:06,606
You in the press and the police
use words like "Mafia," "Cosa Nostra."

709
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:08,525
This is a fantasy.

710
01:10:08,609 --> 01:10:12,196
We Italian-Americans
laid the bricks that built this city.

711
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,156
We have Meucci,
who invented the telephone.

712
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:19,203
We have Don Ameche,
who played the guy who invented it.

713
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:24,083
Buy yourself a raffle ticket,
maybe you'll win a Cadillac.

714
01:10:24,583 --> 01:10:27,002
The salsiccia is wonderful!

715
01:10:27,085 --> 01:10:29,045
Here, have a sandwich.

716
01:10:42,101 --> 01:10:44,937
- Nice to see you, Mr. Zasa.
- Have a nice time.

717
01:10:46,687 --> 01:10:49,023
Don't forget to buy
your raffle tickets.

718
01:10:52,486 --> 01:10:55,197
- What are you doing?
- He didn't mean it.

719
01:10:56,072 --> 01:10:58,909
- Tell him you're sorry.
- Okay, let's go.

720
01:11:17,803 --> 01:11:21,140
Joey! How are you?

721
01:11:21,222 --> 01:11:23,182
How are you, Buddy boy?

722
01:11:24,226 --> 01:11:27,187
Hey, Joey Zasa! Joey, up your ass!

723
01:11:29,231 --> 01:11:32,526
- Who is this? Do you know him?
- Ignore him.

724
01:11:33,485 --> 01:11:35,946
Who's going to win the car? The Ant?

725
01:11:37,697 --> 01:11:42,035
This is what gives Italian-Americans
a bad name. A cappone like this.

726
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:45,163
Joey, up your ass!

727
01:11:45,246 --> 01:11:48,624
Get off the car!
Do you have a raffle ticket?

728
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:51,628
Joey, take a look at my raffle ticket!

729
01:11:52,087 --> 01:11:56,383
Here's what I think of you...
and your raffle ticket.

730
01:11:56,967 --> 01:12:00,596
Get the fuck off this car.
I'll break your fucking balls.

731
01:12:03,432 --> 01:12:05,267
Get out of here!

732
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,366
Run, Joey! You piece of shit!

733
01:12:36,173 --> 01:12:38,092
Open the door!

734
01:12:38,174 --> 01:12:39,927
How are you, Joe?

735
01:12:43,262 --> 01:12:44,472
Zasa!

736
01:13:01,949 --> 01:13:06,911
Don't ever again
give that kind of order.

737
01:13:07,036 --> 01:13:08,914
Not while I'm alive.

738
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,415
Understand?

739
01:13:12,209 --> 01:13:18,465
You were too sick to make a decision.
I got a go-ahead from Neri and Connie.

740
01:13:19,549 --> 01:13:20,717
Connie?

741
01:13:30,518 --> 01:13:33,271
It was the right decision, Uncle Mike.

742
01:13:33,981 --> 01:13:37,860
It was the wrong decision.
I command this family!

743
01:13:38,317 --> 01:13:40,279
Right or wrong...

744
01:13:41,112 --> 01:13:43,865
...it was not what I wanted!

745
01:14:02,551 --> 01:14:04,218
Do you understand?

746
01:14:11,226 --> 01:14:12,311
Yes.

747
01:14:19,067 --> 01:14:20,902
Come on, Michael.

748
01:14:32,498 --> 01:14:33,831
Yes.

749
01:14:35,918 --> 01:14:39,545
Good. Vincent, help me to my bed.

750
01:14:39,629 --> 01:14:41,798
I want to talk to you alone
for a minute.

751
01:14:50,264 --> 01:14:53,852
You know,
I always felt responsible for you.

752
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,771
You know that.

753
01:14:57,688 --> 01:14:59,273
Your father...

754
01:15:00,441 --> 01:15:03,444
...my brother, we were opposites.

755
01:15:04,112 --> 01:15:08,409
We would fight and argue.
But I never doubted his love.

756
01:15:09,325 --> 01:15:13,538
He would do anything for me.
But his temper...

757
01:15:17,334 --> 01:15:21,130
Too much. It clouded his reason.

758
01:15:22,839 --> 01:15:25,508
I don't want you to make that mistake.

759
01:15:28,303 --> 01:15:29,596
Also...

760
01:15:30,638 --> 01:15:33,141
...he, too, had a way with women.

761
01:15:35,143 --> 01:15:37,730
- Vincent...
- So I hear.

762
01:15:37,812 --> 01:15:40,315
What are you doing with my daughter?

763
01:15:42,985 --> 01:15:45,320
What are you doing with her?

764
01:15:49,657 --> 01:15:51,535
It's too dangerous.

765
01:15:54,704 --> 01:15:56,414
Do you hear me?

766
01:16:02,463 --> 01:16:03,630
Okay.

767
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:19,605
Vincenzo...

768
01:16:23,691 --> 01:16:27,612
When they come,
they'll come at what you love.

769
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:22,250
How are you?

770
01:17:23,084 --> 01:17:25,920
Don Bendino, my old friend.

771
01:17:56,785 --> 01:17:58,579
I brought you here,

772
01:17:58,704 --> 01:18:02,081
so that my old friend and protector,
Don Tommasino,

773
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:04,209
could advise us.

774
01:18:06,128 --> 01:18:09,255
What do you think about Altobello?

775
01:18:10,214 --> 01:18:13,051
A very talented man.

776
01:18:13,468 --> 01:18:17,431
He has kept the peace between our
Sicilian and American friends.

777
01:18:18,473 --> 01:18:20,767
The saint of reason.

778
01:18:22,477 --> 01:18:26,315
A blood bath in Atlantic City
left New York a mess.

779
01:18:27,482 --> 01:18:30,069
Joey Zasa at least was running
a tight ship,

780
01:18:30,151 --> 01:18:33,989
but with him out of the picture
we must step in.

781
01:18:34,114 --> 01:18:37,951
- Step back in...
- Or the Chinese and Colombians will.

782
01:18:38,869 --> 01:18:43,790
The Corleones left drugs, so New York
is weak, and Palermo is strong.

783
01:18:45,334 --> 01:18:49,379
Your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind.

784
01:18:52,048 --> 01:18:56,469
Who could give the order
for that massacre...

785
01:18:58,304 --> 01:19:02,267
and still pressure the Vatican deal?

786
01:19:02,558 --> 01:19:07,688
Only Lucchesi can reach
between these two worlds.

787
01:19:09,566 --> 01:19:13,028
"Our ships must all sail
in the same direction..."

788
01:19:14,612 --> 01:19:17,782
Italian politics have had these men
for centuries.

789
01:19:17,865 --> 01:19:20,576
They are the true Mafia.

790
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:23,871
The Archbishop and the Vatican Bank,
that's the big problem.

791
01:19:23,996 --> 01:19:27,918
They're the same problem.
B.J., they're connected.

792
01:19:29,085 --> 01:19:31,547
The Archbishop has powerful friends.

793
01:19:34,424 --> 01:19:36,008
They totally protect him.

794
01:19:36,468 --> 01:19:40,848
Is there someone in the
Church we can turn to?

795
01:19:41,056 --> 01:19:44,601
Someone we can tell our problem to?

796
01:19:45,936 --> 01:19:47,938
Cardinal Lamberto.

797
01:19:48,187 --> 01:19:53,609
A wise and good man... very influential.

798
01:19:53,901 --> 01:19:57,196
He will see you.

799
01:20:01,994 --> 01:20:07,624
I will see this Cardinal Lamberto
and see if we can work things out.

800
01:20:09,418 --> 01:20:13,839
You honor your agreements,
but you are dealing with crooks.

801
01:20:14,923 --> 01:20:16,925
They have no honor.

802
01:20:19,052 --> 01:20:20,721
My word is final.

803
01:20:32,066 --> 01:20:36,403
Politics and crime,
they're the same thing.

804
01:20:58,049 --> 01:21:04,597
I've invited you all here to celebrate
my son's debut in an opera house...

805
01:21:05,264 --> 01:21:07,017
We'll play "Philadelphia."

806
01:21:08,477 --> 01:21:12,689
Seven cards. Two down, four up.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.

807
01:21:12,815 --> 01:21:15,359
...in the opera
"Cavallaria Rusticana."

808
01:21:15,484 --> 01:21:19,780
- It's "Cavalleria Rusticana," Dad.
- "Cavalleria."

809
01:21:19,862 --> 01:21:22,490
I think I have tickets
to the wrong opera.

810
01:21:22,574 --> 01:21:24,493
I've been in New York too long.

811
01:21:25,576 --> 01:21:28,955
You will all receive tickets,
so come on time.

812
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,417
Dad, I've got a present for you.

813
01:21:35,254 --> 01:21:39,383
It comes from the town of Corleone
and it's authentic Sicilian.

814
01:21:40,592 --> 01:21:43,637
And... I learnt it for you.

815
01:21:50,352 --> 01:21:56,608
Burns the moon in the sky,
and I burn with love

816
01:21:57,651 --> 01:22:03,907
Fire that wastes away like my heart

817
01:22:04,907 --> 01:22:10,621
My soul cries in pain

818
01:22:11,956 --> 01:22:18,172
It has no peace,
what a terrible night

819
01:22:19,255 --> 01:22:25,512
Time passes, but day never comes

820
01:22:26,179 --> 01:22:32,686
There is never sun,
if she doesn't return

821
01:22:33,603 --> 01:22:39,860
Burns my earth and burns my heart

822
01:22:41,402 --> 01:22:47,659
She is thirsty for water,
and I am thirsty for love

823
01:22:48,701 --> 01:22:53,998
To whom can I sing my song

824
01:22:55,249 --> 01:23:02,173
If no one appears at the balcony.

825
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:18,773
She was wonderful, beautiful.
I loved her. And then she died.

826
01:23:20,316 --> 01:23:25,279
My trusted bodyguard
planted a bomb in my car.

827
01:23:27,031 --> 01:23:29,284
She drove it before I did.

828
01:23:30,785 --> 01:23:33,913
Why is such a beautiful country
so violent?

829
01:23:34,414 --> 01:23:36,082
History.

830
01:23:36,165 --> 01:23:40,545
Mom was telling me about when your
biggest worry was passing your exams.

831
01:23:40,795 --> 01:23:44,048
- Yes, it was then.
- I worry about you now.

832
01:23:44,674 --> 01:23:49,512
Oh, Mary, you're such a
warm-hearted girl. You always were.

833
01:23:50,012 --> 01:23:53,475
- I love my family.
- Even your cousin Vincent?

834
01:23:57,687 --> 01:23:59,605
I really love him.

835
01:24:01,023 --> 01:24:04,194
- He's your first cousin.
- Then I love him first.

836
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,865
Mary, you can't see him.

837
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:10,993
Just don't see him anymore.

838
01:24:11,994 --> 01:24:15,205
He's right. It's too dangerous.

839
01:24:17,708 --> 01:24:20,669
Mary, you can't see him anymore.

840
01:24:21,085 --> 01:24:23,254
Not in that fashion.

841
01:24:25,798 --> 01:24:29,761
- Please, promise me.
- No!

842
01:24:44,776 --> 01:24:47,404
Bella cugina... Tesoro mio.

843
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:01,335
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

844
01:25:02,294 --> 01:25:05,547
I want you to do something for me.
It's dangerous.

845
01:25:07,382 --> 01:25:10,552
Good. I'm in. What do you need?

846
01:25:11,428 --> 01:25:14,515
I want you to sell your soul
to Don Altobello.

847
01:25:15,307 --> 01:25:16,975
To betray me.

848
01:25:20,353 --> 01:25:22,356
He'd never believe me.

849
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,817
- That depends.
- Sit down.

850
01:25:28,695 --> 01:25:30,280
I have an idea.

851
01:25:32,031 --> 01:25:35,410
See if you can learn
how high Altobello is connected.

852
01:25:39,748 --> 01:25:41,542
Arrange a meeting.

853
01:25:44,169 --> 01:25:48,590
You say how devoted you are to me.
Tell him your problems.

854
01:25:49,758 --> 01:25:52,511
- Ask for his help.
- What problems?

855
01:25:54,637 --> 01:25:57,515
That you want to run away
with my daughter.

856
01:25:58,225 --> 01:26:01,728
But you know that if you do,
I will become your enemy.

857
01:26:06,984 --> 01:26:10,320
- You know that I would never do that.
- I know.

858
01:26:11,696 --> 01:26:16,118
Ask Altobello to speak to me.
To further the marriage.

859
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:21,623
But you're cousins, after all. Michael
was always a little old-fashioned.

860
01:26:22,999 --> 01:26:27,879
Say you can't belong to my legitimate
world. That you want your own family.

861
01:26:28,629 --> 01:26:31,967
I could straighten out
what Joey Zasa left behind.

862
01:26:33,509 --> 01:26:36,512
If you could use your friendship
to persuade him,

863
01:26:37,513 --> 01:26:40,433
I would be indebted to you forever.

864
01:26:42,393 --> 01:26:46,022
A Corleone knows the value
of such a friend.

865
01:26:47,857 --> 01:26:50,276
Then you would work for me?

866
01:26:51,111 --> 01:26:52,362
SÃ¬.

867
01:26:55,074 --> 01:26:57,743
Bacio la mano, Don Altobello.

868
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:05,833
If he hints that he wants you
to betray me, get insulted,

869
01:27:06,459 --> 01:27:08,503
because that's his trap.

870
01:27:15,218 --> 01:27:18,346
You're not telling me
the whole truth, Vincenzo.

871
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:27,271
Isn't it true, that with Michael gone,
the girl controls everything?

872
01:27:31,526 --> 01:27:35,196
- Leave the girl out of this.
- Of course, you love her.

873
01:27:35,321 --> 01:27:37,031
And she loves you.

874
01:27:54,715 --> 01:27:57,844
I guessed it, didn't I?

875
01:27:59,346 --> 01:28:04,183
You're a wise man, Don Altobello.
I'll be learning a lot from you.

876
01:28:05,268 --> 01:28:08,981
The richest man is the one
with the most powerful friends.

877
01:28:11,441 --> 01:28:14,194
It's my duty
to make the introductions.

878
01:28:20,993 --> 01:28:23,078
Don Lucchesi.

879
01:28:25,748 --> 01:28:31,419
Don Altobello tells me that you have
a strong character. A man of respect.

880
01:28:31,544 --> 01:28:34,882
This is the hero who put
Joey Zasa in his grave.

881
01:28:35,382 --> 01:28:39,261
If we'd known of his existence,
we wouldn't have backed Joey.

882
01:28:39,636 --> 01:28:41,679
No one wants another Joe.

883
01:28:43,766 --> 01:28:45,893
Let me be your friend.

884
01:28:46,477 --> 01:28:50,564
- Even the strongest man needs friends.
- I'm flattered.

885
01:28:52,023 --> 01:28:56,527
You're a man of finance and politics.
Things I don't understand.

886
01:28:58,237 --> 01:29:02,241
You understand guns.
Finance is a gun.

887
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:07,539
Politics is knowing
when to pull the trigger.

888
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:13,253
How can I help?

889
01:29:14,588 --> 01:29:15,923
Vieni?

890
01:29:20,928 --> 01:29:25,766
I trusted this business arrangement
with the Archbishop. I trusted him.

891
01:29:25,848 --> 01:29:28,976
I was sure his honesty
was beyond a doubt.

892
01:29:29,895 --> 01:29:34,107
But, as you see,
I'm now the victim of a swindle.

893
01:29:35,191 --> 01:29:36,901
He's stalling me.

894
01:29:36,985 --> 01:29:40,822
Vast monies have gone to people
in high political places

895
01:29:41,197 --> 01:29:44,159
and the Vatican Bank is the guarantor.

896
01:29:44,243 --> 01:29:49,455
If what you say is true,
there will be a great scandal.

897
01:29:51,499 --> 01:29:56,504
Look at this stone. It has been
in the water for a very long time,

898
01:29:56,588 --> 01:30:00,342
but the water has not penetrated it.

899
01:30:04,554 --> 01:30:05,806
Look...

900
01:30:07,014 --> 01:30:12,146
Perfectly dry. The same thing
has happened to men in Europe.

901
01:30:12,228 --> 01:30:16,357
For centuries they have been
surrounded by Christianity,

902
01:30:17,151 --> 01:30:23,072
but Christ has not penetrated.
Christ doesn't live within them.

903
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:31,331
- What's happening?
- Could you get me something sweet?

904
01:30:31,414 --> 01:30:34,709
Some orange juice, candy...

905
01:30:38,588 --> 01:30:40,840
I have trouble with diabetes.

906
01:30:44,553 --> 01:30:46,847
My blood sugar goes low.

907
01:30:46,929 --> 01:30:48,723
I understand.

908
01:31:11,871 --> 01:31:14,792
It happens sometimes
when I'm under stress.

909
01:31:15,793 --> 01:31:17,419
I understand.

910
01:31:19,254 --> 01:31:23,008
To come to you
on such a delicate matter...

911
01:31:26,053 --> 01:31:30,641
Accusations against your Archbishop.
It was difficult for me.

912
01:31:32,351 --> 01:31:34,061
The mind suffers

913
01:31:34,561 --> 01:31:37,356
and the body cries out.

914
01:31:43,611 --> 01:31:45,114
That's true.

915
01:31:46,824 --> 01:31:50,661
Would you like to make
your confession?

916
01:31:57,418 --> 01:31:59,253
Your Eminence, I'm...

917
01:32:03,589 --> 01:32:08,971
It's been so long. I wouldn't...
I wouldn't know where to...

918
01:32:10,513 --> 01:32:12,391
It's been 30 years.

919
01:32:14,308 --> 01:32:16,978
I'd use up
too much of your time, I think.

920
01:32:17,896 --> 01:32:20,273
I always have time to save souls.

921
01:32:21,941 --> 01:32:26,571
- Well, I'm beyond redemption.
- No, no...

922
01:32:36,039 --> 01:32:39,752
I hear the confessions
of my own priests here.

923
01:32:41,085 --> 01:32:44,589
Sometimes the desire to confess
is overwhelming,

924
01:32:45,298 --> 01:32:47,676
and we must seize the moment.

925
01:32:52,306 --> 01:32:55,976
What is the point of confessing
if I don't repent?

926
01:32:58,562 --> 01:33:00,939
I hear you are a practical man.

927
01:33:01,898 --> 01:33:03,941
What have you got to lose?

928
01:33:15,913 --> 01:33:17,330
Go on.

929
01:33:24,004 --> 01:33:25,172
I...

930
01:33:26,632 --> 01:33:28,467
...betrayed my wife.

931
01:33:30,218 --> 01:33:31,761
Go on, my son.

932
01:33:37,433 --> 01:33:39,186
I betrayed myself.

933
01:33:42,271 --> 01:33:43,773
I killed men.

934
01:33:47,861 --> 01:33:50,280
And I ordered men to be killed.

935
01:33:51,824 --> 01:33:53,991
Go on, my son. Go on.

936
01:34:00,124 --> 01:34:01,333
It's useless.

937
01:34:03,252 --> 01:34:04,919
Go on, my son.

938
01:34:06,338 --> 01:34:07,840
I killed...

939
01:34:12,844 --> 01:34:15,388
I ordered the death of my brother.

940
01:34:16,557 --> 01:34:18,308
He injured me.

941
01:34:19,977 --> 01:34:22,020
I killed my mother's son.

942
01:34:23,856 --> 01:34:25,898
I killed my father's son.

943
01:34:36,701 --> 01:34:41,164
Your sins are terrible,
and it is just that you suffer.

944
01:34:42,749 --> 01:34:45,127
Your life could be redeemed,

945
01:34:46,544 --> 01:34:48,297
but I know that
you don't believe that.

946
01:34:48,379 --> 01:34:50,382
You will not change.

947
01:35:15,615 --> 01:35:22,246
Pope Paul VI, Supreme Pontiff
of the Roman Catholic Church...

948
01:35:23,248 --> 01:35:26,375
died last night at 9:40 p.m.

949
01:35:27,169 --> 01:35:30,589
The Pope was 81 years old...

950
01:35:31,589 --> 01:35:35,093
and had been in poor health
for the last several months.

951
01:35:42,476 --> 01:35:43,852
Connie...

952
01:35:45,687 --> 01:35:50,067
All my life I've kept trying
to go up in society.

953
01:35:50,734 --> 01:35:53,654
To where everything higher up
was legal, straight...

954
01:35:55,739 --> 01:35:59,284
But the higher I go,
the more crooked it becomes.

955
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:04,248
Where the hell does it end?

956
01:36:13,257 --> 01:36:16,718
They've been killing each other
for centuries here.

957
01:36:18,094 --> 01:36:22,182
For money, for pride, for family.

958
01:36:25,352 --> 01:36:29,356
To keep from becoming the slaves
of the rich pezzi da novanta.

959
01:36:36,446 --> 01:36:38,699
I made confession, Connie.

960
01:36:39,741 --> 01:36:41,826
I confessed my sins.

961
01:36:43,536 --> 01:36:46,080
Why? That's not like you.

962
01:36:46,164 --> 01:36:48,624
You don't have to confess your sins
to a stranger.

963
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:51,085
It was the man.

964
01:36:52,087 --> 01:36:55,799
He's a good man. A true priest.

965
01:36:59,928 --> 01:37:01,972
He can change things.

966
01:37:04,223 --> 01:37:05,976
Michael...

967
01:37:07,436 --> 01:37:11,315
You know,
sometimes I think of poor Fredo.

968
01:37:12,148 --> 01:37:15,444
Drowned. It was God's will.

969
01:37:17,987 --> 01:37:20,281
It was a terrible accident.

970
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:23,619
But it's finished.

971
01:37:28,706 --> 01:37:30,542
Michael, I love you.

972
01:37:32,878 --> 01:37:34,838
I'll always help you.

973
01:37:47,101 --> 01:37:48,602
Oh, Connie...

974
01:38:18,673 --> 01:38:25,638
I am honored, Don Altobello, that you've
come from Palermo to visit me.

975
01:38:29,017 --> 01:38:34,063
Hey, the little kid! He's grown.

976
01:38:34,690 --> 01:38:36,442
Do the donkey for me.

977
01:38:54,084 --> 01:38:58,130
It's been some time since we
did business together.

978
01:39:02,092 --> 01:39:07,181
You are my "ace in the hole,"
as we say in America.

979
01:39:07,263 --> 01:39:13,061
I have a stone in my shoe.
You can remove it.

980
01:39:20,319 --> 01:39:22,821
Only one stone?

981
01:39:35,374 --> 01:39:36,959
Kay!

982
01:39:37,085 --> 01:39:39,338
- Connie!
- How are you?

983
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:42,508
Mary, I've missed you.

984
01:39:43,008 --> 01:39:46,678
- Hello, Michael.
- Mom, look at this.

985
01:39:50,766 --> 01:39:52,893
It's too bad Douglas couldn't come.

986
01:39:52,976 --> 01:39:56,688
I know. He had a very important trial.

987
01:39:56,771 --> 01:39:58,773
I know he wanted to come.

988
01:39:59,941 --> 01:40:01,984
- The car is...
- Okay.

989
01:40:03,945 --> 01:40:10,159
- Well, your son is an artist.
- Oh, yes. Thanks to you.

990
01:40:10,828 --> 01:40:15,206
- What for?
- For making me let him go.

991
01:40:15,915 --> 01:40:20,962
Well, after all these years, here I am
in Sicily for the first time.

992
01:40:21,045 --> 01:40:22,923
I want to get
a picture of you together.

993
01:40:23,005 --> 01:40:24,173
Okay.

994
01:40:26,134 --> 01:40:27,844
Hey, Dad. Smile!

995
01:40:32,348 --> 01:40:35,268
I see you still have Al Neri. Why?

996
01:40:36,477 --> 01:40:40,106
I need him. He helps me
get in and out of the car.

997
01:40:41,275 --> 01:40:44,987
- He carries my briefcase.
- You're still a liar, Michael.

998
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:49,867
Let me show you Sicily,
the real Sicily.

999
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:51,535
So you'll understand
the family history.

1000
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:55,538
I think I understand
it well enough.

1001
01:41:47,132 --> 01:41:53,054
Anthony, I have something you made
for me a very long time ago.

1002
01:41:54,764 --> 01:41:57,558
- Might bring you luck.
- Thanks.

1003
01:42:01,771 --> 01:42:05,024
You saved it... I remember.

1004
01:42:09,029 --> 01:42:10,571
Thank you, Dad.

1005
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:13,991
I'm proud of you.

1006
01:42:14,743 --> 01:42:16,285
Thank you.

1007
01:42:32,593 --> 01:42:35,346
- Are they as good as they look?
- Better.

1008
01:42:35,431 --> 01:42:39,893
They're the best. As long as they are
around, Uncle Michael is safe.

1009
01:42:40,561 --> 01:42:42,103
Goodbye.

1010
01:42:44,731 --> 01:42:46,691
Tell your father
I'll be back for dinner.

1011
01:42:46,775 --> 01:42:47,942
Okay.

1012
01:42:48,444 --> 01:42:51,071
- Have fun.
- Tell Tony to wait for me.

1013
01:42:51,155 --> 01:42:52,614
I will.

1014
01:42:55,159 --> 01:42:58,829
Buongiorno, signora. At your service.

1015
01:43:02,749 --> 01:43:05,627
If I see Dad, I'll tell him you left.

1016
01:43:11,174 --> 01:43:14,887
You're the only one left
with my father's strength.

1017
01:43:17,013 --> 01:43:20,976
If anything happens to Michael,
I want you to strike back.

1018
01:43:23,853 --> 01:43:26,022
I'll have everything ready.

1019
01:43:29,485 --> 01:43:31,195
Do you swear?

1020
01:43:38,576 --> 01:43:40,204
I swear to you.

1021
01:44:04,645 --> 01:44:06,312
Here it is.

1022
01:44:08,065 --> 01:44:10,692
The house where my father was born.

1023
01:44:11,819 --> 01:44:17,199
This is where they came to take him
when he was a boy. To kill him.

1024
01:44:20,410 --> 01:44:22,203
Wait...

1025
01:44:22,954 --> 01:44:24,914
Listen to that.

1026
01:44:44,017 --> 01:44:46,019
You know Mary's in love.

1027
01:44:47,521 --> 01:44:49,106
Yes, I know.

1028
01:44:50,356 --> 01:44:54,194
With a handsome young Italian man
with dark eyes...

1029
01:44:55,611 --> 01:44:57,447
I won't allow it.

1030
01:45:00,284 --> 01:45:03,954
It's wrong.
It's wrong and it's dangerous.

1031
01:45:04,163 --> 01:45:07,040
"Oh father, my father!"

1032
01:45:07,708 --> 01:45:10,043
"Give me some time to pray
to the Lord."

1033
01:45:11,210 --> 01:45:14,173
The Baroness of Carini had
betrayed her husband...

1034
01:45:14,839 --> 01:45:17,633
and fallen in love with her cousin.

1035
01:45:17,968 --> 01:45:19,970
"There will be no forgiveness!"

1036
01:45:20,303 --> 01:45:23,931
Her father stabbed her
through the heart.

1037
01:45:36,195 --> 01:45:37,696
Honor, huh?

1038
01:45:57,382 --> 01:46:00,427
I remember the time you came
to my parents' house

1039
01:46:00,552 --> 01:46:04,056
and told me about the family business.

1040
01:46:04,181 --> 01:46:09,143
How you'd never have anything
to do with it. You sounded like Tony.

1041
01:46:10,187 --> 01:46:12,189
I was a lot like Tony.

1042
01:46:19,821 --> 01:46:22,657
- I can barely see him... Kay?
- What?

1043
01:46:22,782 --> 01:46:25,451
- Do you mind driving?
- What's wrong?

1044
01:46:25,576 --> 01:46:28,579
My eyes.
Sometimes they're all right, but...

1045
01:46:30,289 --> 01:46:32,625
I have to see Don Tommasino...

1046
01:46:36,254 --> 01:46:37,713
Well...

1047
01:46:38,923 --> 01:46:42,261
- There are no bodyguards today.
- I really snuck away.

1048
01:46:49,435 --> 01:46:53,856
Father, where are you going?
Would you like a ride?

1049
01:47:02,947 --> 01:47:07,201
I know you. You're Mosca
of Montelepre.

1050
01:47:08,786 --> 01:47:12,206
You were an assassin then,
and you're an assassin now.

1051
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:15,753
I know Michael Corleone
is at your house.

1052
01:47:16,085 --> 01:47:18,379
I will pass through the gates with you.

1053
01:47:35,271 --> 01:47:37,065
How are you?

1054
01:47:37,148 --> 01:47:40,777
This is Calo, one of my bodyguards
in the old days.

1055
01:47:46,616 --> 01:47:49,203
- We can wait here.
- You want a drink?

1056
01:47:54,708 --> 01:47:57,503
I spent a lot of time in this room...

1057
01:47:58,629 --> 01:48:00,672
...thinking of you.

1058
01:48:03,674 --> 01:48:05,843
And then you got married.

1059
01:48:09,431 --> 01:48:12,810
- I still thought of you.
- What's in that room?

1060
01:48:17,606 --> 01:48:21,151
This is dangerous for you.
This is Sicily.

1061
01:48:24,279 --> 01:48:26,656
- I love this country.
- Why?

1062
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:32,663
Well, all through history,

1063
01:48:32,745 --> 01:48:35,206
terrible things have happened
to these people.

1064
01:48:36,208 --> 01:48:38,419
Terrible injustices.

1065
01:48:39,253 --> 01:48:44,174
But they still expect good,
rather than bad, will happen to them.

1066
01:48:44,715 --> 01:48:47,052
Sort of like me and you?

1067
01:48:50,847 --> 01:48:53,516
- How so?
- I'm still here, right?

1068
01:48:54,517 --> 01:48:57,562
We do have a bad history,
but I'm still here.

1069
01:48:57,687 --> 01:49:00,356
Yes, you are, but with dread.

1070
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,905
Give me the order!

1071
01:49:07,530 --> 01:49:10,700
Is that supposed to make me
not dread you?

1072
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:15,163
We're in Sicily. It's opera.

1073
01:49:17,790 --> 01:49:19,250
Okay.

1074
01:49:21,794 --> 01:49:23,588
What do we do now?

1075
01:49:26,299 --> 01:49:30,219
Be reasonable.
Let's try not to hurt each other.

1076
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:40,063
I want you to forgive me.

1077
01:49:42,857 --> 01:49:45,777
- For what?
- Everything.

1078
01:49:49,530 --> 01:49:51,657
Oh, like God?

1079
01:49:53,576 --> 01:49:56,204
No, I need something a little closer.

1080
01:49:59,124 --> 01:50:02,252
You couldn't understand,
back in those days.

1081
01:50:03,754 --> 01:50:08,634
I loved my father. I swore I would
never be a man like him,

1082
01:50:08,717 --> 01:50:12,429
but I loved him and he was in danger.
What could I do?

1083
01:50:13,097 --> 01:50:15,891
And then later, you were in danger.

1084
01:50:16,767 --> 01:50:20,104
Our children were in danger.
What could I do?

1085
01:50:21,105 --> 01:50:26,401
You were all that I... loved
and valued most in the world.

1086
01:50:28,779 --> 01:50:31,406
Now I'm losing you. I lost you.

1087
01:50:32,115 --> 01:50:33,991
You're gone.

1088
01:50:35,285 --> 01:50:38,122
And it was all for nothing. So...

1089
01:50:42,834 --> 01:50:47,797
You have to understand, I had a whole
different destiny planned.

1090
01:50:51,427 --> 01:50:53,303
All right, I'll stop.

1091
01:51:03,771 --> 01:51:07,734
I really don't know what you
want from me, Michael.

1092
01:51:08,151 --> 01:51:12,321
- I mean...
- I'm not the man that you think I am.

1093
01:51:14,199 --> 01:51:17,494
- I don't know.
- I love you, Kay.

1094
01:51:19,579 --> 01:51:21,539
Don't dread me anymore.

1095
01:51:27,295 --> 01:51:31,174
You know,
every night here in Sicily...

1096
01:51:33,343 --> 01:51:38,307
...I dream about my wife
and my children...

1097
01:51:41,810 --> 01:51:43,771
...and how I lost them.

1098
01:51:45,981 --> 01:51:51,695
I guess that if it's any consolation,
I want you to know that...

1099
01:51:55,156 --> 01:51:56,657
...that...

1100
01:51:57,700 --> 01:52:00,036
...I always loved you, Michael.

1101
01:52:01,579 --> 01:52:03,289
And you know...

1102
01:52:05,124 --> 01:52:07,502
...always, I always will.

1103
01:52:36,072 --> 01:52:38,366
What is it? What's wrong?

1104
01:52:38,825 --> 01:52:41,536
They found Don Tommasino shot.

1105
01:52:42,788 --> 01:52:44,998
Is he dead?

1106
01:52:46,834 --> 01:52:50,254
My master is dead.
Blood calls for blood.

1107
01:52:50,838 --> 01:52:53,715
I must have revenge!

1108
01:52:57,511 --> 01:53:02,725
Some day, you may have to do
a difficult service for me.

1109
01:53:03,016 --> 01:53:04,518
Command me.

1110
01:53:06,395 --> 01:53:07,562
It never ends.

1111
01:53:07,646 --> 01:53:09,857
I will avenge him!

1112
01:53:25,038 --> 01:53:26,540
Totals...

1113
01:53:28,624 --> 01:53:30,918
Lorscheider, 1 vote.

1114
01:53:31,712 --> 01:53:34,548
Siri, 11 votes.

1115
01:53:35,382 --> 01:53:38,427
Lamberto, 99 votes.

1116
01:53:43,973 --> 01:53:49,187
Do you accept your election
as supreme pontiff?

1117
01:53:49,812 --> 01:53:55,735
Oh, God, shed light on the decision
they have taken on my behalf.

1118
01:53:56,570 --> 01:53:58,197
I accept.

1119
01:53:58,446 --> 01:54:00,949
By what name do you wish to be called?

1120
01:54:01,407 --> 01:54:04,328
John Paul the First.

1121
01:54:33,981 --> 01:54:38,820
I will do things "right away,"
rather than in "a little while"...

1122
01:54:40,822 --> 01:54:46,203
Frederick Keinszig, known as "God's
Banker," has been reported missing.

1123
01:54:46,285 --> 01:54:53,292
He was last seen leaving the Rome
offices of Vatican owned Immobiliare.

1124
01:54:53,877 --> 01:54:57,339
Also missing was a large sum
of money and several documents.

1125
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:00,883
Keinszig, you fool.

1126
01:55:04,387 --> 01:55:09,308
His absence casts further suspicion
on the dealings of the Vatican Bank.

1127
01:55:09,392 --> 01:55:12,103
For several years,
the bank and its companies

1128
01:55:12,187 --> 01:55:16,442
have been the object of allegations
of disreputable business practices.

1129
01:55:17,651 --> 01:55:21,780
Lucchesi, will you please
try to understand?

1130
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:27,536
I have phoned him.
I have waited here by the phone.

1131
01:55:30,204 --> 01:55:33,750
You would do well to remember,
Mr. Lucchesi,

1132
01:55:34,584 --> 01:55:41,215
that this Pope has very
different ideas from the last one.

1133
01:55:54,312 --> 01:55:56,355
Goodbye, my old friend.

1134
01:56:06,282 --> 01:56:07,993
I swear,

1135
01:56:08,451 --> 01:56:10,745
on the lives of my children...

1136
01:56:15,292 --> 01:56:17,919
Give me a chance to redeem myself...

1137
01:56:21,882 --> 01:56:25,511
...and I will sin no more.

1138
01:56:50,785 --> 01:56:53,288
It's not just a bad banking deal.

1139
01:56:54,330 --> 01:56:56,417
These guys are butchers.

1140
01:56:57,625 --> 01:57:00,253
- What guys?
- Lucchesi.

1141
01:57:02,088 --> 01:57:06,008
He controls all of them:
Altobello, the Archbishop...

1142
01:57:07,803 --> 01:57:10,431
...others higher up, P2 maybe.

1143
01:57:10,513 --> 01:57:13,558
Secret unknown.
They're running things.

1144
01:57:17,353 --> 01:57:22,109
- I'm in their way.
- He's hired an assassin to kill you.

1145
01:57:22,735 --> 01:57:25,362
A Sicilian. I don't know his name.

1146
01:57:27,530 --> 01:57:29,699
But they say he never fails.

1147
01:57:30,993 --> 01:57:33,120
Then no one is safe.

1148
01:57:35,998 --> 01:57:38,375
Even the new Pope is in danger.

1149
01:57:39,459 --> 01:57:42,503
We still have time.
We can prevent this.

1150
01:57:47,926 --> 01:57:50,262
I tried, Vincent.

1151
01:57:52,388 --> 01:57:53,891
I tried...

1152
01:57:55,225 --> 01:57:59,646
...to keep everything from coming
to this. But it's not possible.

1153
01:58:01,190 --> 01:58:02,941
Not in this world.

1154
01:58:04,567 --> 01:58:06,277
Give me the order.

1155
01:58:10,156 --> 01:58:12,534
You won't be able to go back.

1156
01:58:13,576 --> 01:58:15,704
- You'll be like me.
- Good.

1157
01:58:17,498 --> 01:58:19,500
All my life I wanted out.

1158
01:58:20,209 --> 01:58:22,252
I wanted the family out.

1159
01:58:24,338 --> 01:58:26,090
I don't want out.

1160
01:58:26,632 --> 01:58:29,426
I want the power
to preserve the family.

1161
01:58:34,097 --> 01:58:36,307
I'm asking for the order.

1162
01:58:53,075 --> 01:58:55,411
I can't do it anymore.

1163
01:58:59,748 --> 01:59:03,335
Well, it doesn't matter.
Vincent knows what to do.

1164
01:59:03,419 --> 01:59:08,340
Come on outside.
Take a rest and don't think about it.

1165
01:59:08,632 --> 01:59:11,552
- All I do is think about it.
- I'm your son.

1166
01:59:12,718 --> 01:59:14,804
Command me in all things.

1167
01:59:17,057 --> 01:59:18,976
Give up my daughter.

1168
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:24,188
That's the price you pay...

1169
01:59:25,315 --> 01:59:27,484
...for the life you choose.

1170
01:59:53,718 --> 01:59:55,261
Nephew...

1171
01:59:57,681 --> 01:59:59,725
...from this moment on...

1172
02:00:01,142 --> 02:00:03,645
...call yourself Vincent Corleone.

1173
02:00:08,441 --> 02:00:09,692
Sit.

1174
02:00:24,958 --> 02:00:26,585
Don Vincenzo...

1175
02:00:32,590 --> 02:00:34,301
Don Corleone...

1176
02:00:37,762 --> 02:00:39,889
Don Vincenzo Corleone...

1177
02:02:13,484 --> 02:02:15,819
E tu, Vincenzo...

1178
02:02:15,944 --> 02:02:20,574
I know how you feel about Michael,
but you can't save him.

1179
02:02:21,532 --> 02:02:22,868
He's lost.

1180
02:02:24,535 --> 02:02:26,204
Think of yourself.

1181
02:02:27,414 --> 02:02:30,209
What's your answer, Vincent?

1182
02:02:31,709 --> 02:02:33,377
Enjoy the opera.

1183
02:02:35,505 --> 02:02:37,548
It's all taken care of.

1184
02:02:43,097 --> 02:02:45,849
Check the bar.
I'll check the top floor.

1185
02:02:49,686 --> 02:02:54,107
"Here's hoping Tony sings better at
the Teatro Massimo than in the shower.

1186
02:02:54,191 --> 02:02:56,443
"Love, Douglas."

1187
02:02:56,526 --> 02:02:59,946
- My darling Constanza!
- Don Altobello.

1188
02:03:00,864 --> 02:03:03,909
- This is a great occasion.
- Come, sit down.

1189
02:03:08,621 --> 02:03:13,127
Happy birthday. You're 80,
but don't look more than 60.

1190
02:03:13,209 --> 02:03:15,587
You're the only one who remembered.

1191
02:03:15,712 --> 02:03:17,423
We've just got the word.

1192
02:03:17,505 --> 02:03:20,926
The Pope has ratified
the Immobiliare deal. We've won.

1193
02:03:21,008 --> 02:03:22,677
Congratulations.

1194
02:03:25,472 --> 02:03:27,725
Strange how things work.

1195
02:03:27,850 --> 02:03:31,895
The Pope is doing what you
said he'd do. He's cleaning house.

1196
02:03:32,980 --> 02:03:36,734
He should be careful.
It's dangerous to be an honest man.

1197
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:46,118
I want to put more muscle backstage
with Tony.

1198
02:03:58,213 --> 02:04:01,467
On your birthday you used to
shower me with treats.

1199
02:04:01,592 --> 02:04:03,427
Tootsie Rolls!

1200
02:04:04,303 --> 02:04:07,598
The nuns who made this cannoli
took a vow of silence.

1201
02:04:07,681 --> 02:04:09,725
They're the very finest.

1202
02:04:13,562 --> 02:04:16,273
- Hey.
- Hey, cous.

1203
02:04:18,357 --> 02:04:21,110
Hi. Where's your leather?

1204
02:04:25,281 --> 02:04:26,824
Stop it.

1205
02:04:32,873 --> 02:04:35,834
You're so thin. You eat it.

1206
02:04:52,642 --> 02:04:53,976
Ãˆ buono.

1207
02:04:54,477 --> 02:04:56,813
Grazie!

1208
02:04:59,775 --> 02:05:04,071
It's over. There are things I have
to do that you can't be part of.

1209
02:05:04,154 --> 02:05:07,074
It's not your father's decision,
it's mine.

1210
02:05:09,034 --> 02:05:11,120
Don't hate your father.

1211
02:05:13,414 --> 02:05:17,084
There are things I'll be part of
that you can't be around.

1212
02:05:19,002 --> 02:05:21,713
After tonight,
you won't see me anymore.

1213
02:05:26,051 --> 02:05:29,679
You've got to understand, Mary.
You've got to understand.

1214
02:05:30,681 --> 02:05:32,348
I'll always love you.

1215
02:05:45,529 --> 02:05:47,364
Love somebody else.

1216
02:09:28,669 --> 02:09:32,548
- They won't try anything.
- Everything's fine. It's all clear.

1217
02:09:32,630 --> 02:09:35,467
I've already sent Al Neri
to the Vatican.

1218
02:09:47,937 --> 02:09:50,565
Mr. Lucchesi's house?

1219
02:09:50,648 --> 02:09:51,650
Yes.

1220
02:09:52,151 --> 02:09:56,363
I bring a message
from Michael Corleone.

1221
02:09:57,780 --> 02:09:59,115
Let him in.

1222
02:11:28,329 --> 02:11:30,248
Buona sera.

1223
02:14:51,240 --> 02:14:53,118
Good. You got him.

1224
02:15:45,379 --> 02:15:48,840
Tonight the Corleone family
settles its accounts.

1225
02:15:49,174 --> 02:15:53,678
Keinszig...
That little Swiss banker fuck.

1226
02:15:54,971 --> 02:15:58,683
He's been swindling everyone
from the beginning. Fuck him.

1227
02:16:00,477 --> 02:16:03,105
Don Lucchesi, my friend.

1228
02:16:03,187 --> 02:16:05,857
Calo will pay him a visit at his home.

1229
02:16:08,526 --> 02:16:11,988
Neri, take a train to Rome.

1230
02:16:13,364 --> 02:16:15,450
Light a candle for the Archbishop.

1231
02:16:51,319 --> 02:16:54,614
Tea, Your Holiness?
It will help you sleep.

1232
02:17:17,595 --> 02:17:20,598
This is from Vincent Corleone.

1233
02:18:18,782 --> 02:18:20,075
It's serious.

1234
02:18:20,158 --> 02:18:23,828
Our man inside the Vatican says
there's a plot against the Pope.

1235
02:18:23,953 --> 02:18:26,122
He'll have a heart attack?

1236
02:18:33,255 --> 02:18:38,469
This Pope has powerful enemies.
We may not be in time to save him.

1237
02:18:41,429 --> 02:18:42,972
Let's go back.

1238
02:19:09,916 --> 02:19:11,417
Your Holiness?

1239
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:18,926
Eminence.

1240
02:19:34,857 --> 02:19:37,486
The Holy Father is dead!

1241
02:21:07,868 --> 02:21:09,327
Sleep.

1242
02:21:10,161 --> 02:21:11,914
Sleep, Godfather.

1243
02:21:27,553 --> 02:21:29,013
Our friend's dead.

1244
02:22:22,024 --> 02:22:23,985
Speak... tell me.

1245
02:22:25,612 --> 02:22:31,869
You have lost the faith of the people.

1246
02:22:33,327 --> 02:22:37,790
He who builds on the people
builds on mud.

1247
02:22:38,249 --> 02:22:41,961
And Michael Corleone's message?

1248
02:22:58,896 --> 02:23:05,276
It's very important.
I must whisper it in your ear.

1249
02:23:09,072 --> 02:23:11,115
He's clean.

1250
02:23:29,509 --> 02:23:32,178
Power wears out those who don't have it.

1251
02:25:19,577 --> 02:25:23,539
- Can I talk to you now?
- No, it's not a good time.

1252
02:25:23,623 --> 02:25:27,377
- You're just like my father.
- Stay with the family. Go on.

1253
02:25:29,045 --> 02:25:30,630
- Talk to me.
- The twins are dead.

1254
02:25:31,006 --> 02:25:35,135
In about one minute, there will be
carabinieri all over this place.

1255
02:25:36,011 --> 02:25:38,514
Get everybody to the cars, quietly.

1256
02:25:39,014 --> 02:25:40,598
- Got it.
- Quiet.

1257
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:58,200
The name Corleone
will be associated with a voice.

1258
02:26:08,252 --> 02:26:09,503
Dad...

1259
02:26:25,853 --> 02:26:29,982
- You don't have to do this to me.
- Do what? What do you mean?

1260
02:26:56,425 --> 02:26:57,718
Dad...

1261
02:27:14,693 --> 02:27:16,695
No! Mary!

1262
02:27:19,907 --> 02:27:21,366
God, no!

1263
02:30:24,361 --> 02:30:29,361
