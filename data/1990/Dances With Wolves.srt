1
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:32,154
- Is this the last one?
- I don't know.

2
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,254
Theres no ether, either.

3
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:35,987
Jesus Christ.

4
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,263
You there! Is this the last one?

5
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:48,100
God, what a mess.

6
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,277
At least theres no gangrene.

7
00:01:51,817 --> 00:01:54,217
There will be if it doesn't come off soon.

8
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:57,253
I can't saw if I can't keep my eyes open.

9
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:00,018
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:01,595 --> 00:02:04,564
Lets coffee up. He can wait a few more minutes.

11
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:18,881
God!

12
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:47,328
Glass.

13
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,930
- Is that Tuckers men?
- Yes, sir. I think it is.

14
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:55,166
How long has it been like this?

15
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,140
We found em this morning, sir.
They've been here for two days.

16
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,422
Is that you, Lieutenant?

17
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:16,523
Sons of bitches.

18
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:22,534
Come on. You better take cover.

19
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:27,378
I ain't kidding. These boys are shooters.
Come on. Go under cover.

20
00:05:28,147 --> 00:05:29,512
There you go.

21
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,323
You went to the hospital?

22
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:41,528
It was no good.

23
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:46,930
What's going on here?

24
00:05:47,404 --> 00:05:49,065
What's going on here?

25
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:52,001
That seems to be the question, all right.

26
00:05:52,877 --> 00:05:54,902
See, you could ask the major...

27
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:57,281
...but he don't know.

28
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:58,677
He's busy.

29
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:01,581
He's busy trying to figure out
how come the officers mess...

30
00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:03,722
...run out of peach ice cream.

31
00:06:04,492 --> 00:06:06,483
Then, of course, you got the general.

32
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:08,792
He come up to see the show.

33
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:10,931
All he knows is there ain't no show...

34
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:14,101
...which ain't entirely correct
cause we started a balloon up...

35
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,864
...but they shot her down
before we got off the ground.

36
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:20,566
Nobodys made a run either way.
It's been a standoff all damned day.

37
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:25,645
Now, the major, he's looking at the general.

38
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,946
He's thinking to himself,
I better do something.

39
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,622
You know what that means.

40
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,818
I sure as hell don't want to be
the first one across this field.

41
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:38,461
They're supposed to be beat up just like us.

42
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:42,032
Hell, everybody knows
Tuckers men are tough as cobs.

43
00:06:42,604 --> 00:06:46,267
So far, the only thing been killed out here
is three milking cows.

44
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:49,475
Course, thats about to change.

45
00:06:54,586 --> 00:06:56,213
You son of a bitch.

46
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,590
You know, some of the boys are saying
if we ain't gonna fight...

47
00:07:02,963 --> 00:07:05,693
...we could just settle
this whole business with a little...

48
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:07,562
...high-stakes poker.

49
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,600
Wouldnt that be a sight?

50
00:07:09,772 --> 00:07:13,139
A bunch of fellas
sitting in the middle of this field...

51
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:14,469
...drawing cards.

52
00:07:23,956 --> 00:07:25,423
What is it, sir?

53
00:07:25,557 --> 00:07:26,922
Looks like a suicide.

54
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:28,919
Tucker!

55
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:43,101
What's he doing?

56
00:08:09,945 --> 00:08:12,914
- What did you say to him?
- I didnt say nothing.

57
00:08:37,312 --> 00:08:39,143
Come on back, you son of a bitch!

58
00:08:41,717 --> 00:08:44,550
- You won't make it no second time!
- All right by me.

59
00:08:48,392 --> 00:08:49,757
Forgive me, Father.

60
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,491
- He's coming back again!
- Here he comes, boys!

61
00:09:31,211 --> 00:09:33,236
- Ready!
- I got him.

62
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:18,767
Don't...

63
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:22,870
Don't take off my foot.

64
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:26,177
You rest easy, son. Youll keep your foot.

65
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,186
With God as my judge, youll keep it.

66
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:36,387
- Bring up my ambulance.
- Sir?

67
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:39,761
Bring up my ambulance,
and bring my surgeon with it!

68
00:11:41,503 --> 00:11:44,233
We got an officer
who's worth something lying here.

69
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:14,341
The strangeness of this life
cannot be measured.

70
00:12:14,478 --> 00:12:16,139
In trying to produce my own death...

71
00:12:16,313 --> 00:12:19,009
...I was elevated to the status of a living hero.

72
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:20,980
I was also awarded Cisco...

73
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:24,019
...the trusty mount that carried
me across the field that day.

74
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:28,057
And on full recovery,
was given transfer to any station I desired.

75
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:32,057
The bloody slaughter continues in the east
as I arrive at Fort Hayes.

76
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:36,864
A tiny island of men and material
surrounded by a never-ending sea of prairie.

77
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:36,138
Lieutenant.

78
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,329
Where can I find Maj. Fambrough?

79
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:01,963
Down at the end of the hall.

80
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,404
Thank you.

81
00:14:12,888 --> 00:14:15,083
Lt. John J. Dunbar.

82
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:21,828
Lt. John J. Dunbar?

83
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:24,526
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

84
00:14:25,904 --> 00:14:27,565
Indian fighter.

85
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:29,766
Excuse me?

86
00:14:29,976 --> 00:14:32,410
It says here that youre
to be posted on the frontier.

87
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:33,807
The frontier is Indian country.

88
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:36,415
I quickly deduced that youre an Indian fighter.

89
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,075
I did not ascend to this position
by being stupid.

90
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:41,084
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

91
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:49,292
It says here that youve been decorated.

92
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,660
Yes, sir.

93
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:55,533
And they sent you here to be posted?

94
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,302
Actually, sir, I'm here at my own request.

95
00:14:58,477 --> 00:15:00,206
Really? Why?

96
00:15:01,348 --> 00:15:03,873
I've always wanted to see the frontier.

97
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:05,980
You want to see the frontier?

98
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:08,148
Yes, sir.

99
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:09,648
Before it's gone.

100
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:19,160
Such a smart lad, coming straight to me.

101
00:15:25,844 --> 00:15:26,902
Sir...

102
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:28,673
...Knight.

103
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:32,774
I am sending you on a knights errand.

104
00:15:34,388 --> 00:15:36,379
You will report to Captain Cargill...

105
00:15:37,158 --> 00:15:39,456
...at the furthermost outpost of the realm...

106
00:15:40,195 --> 00:15:41,628
...Fort Sedgewick.

107
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:46,793
My personal seal will assure your safety...

108
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:50,473
...through many miles
of wild and hostile country.

109
00:16:00,487 --> 00:16:02,352
- I was wondering...
- Yes?

110
00:16:03,491 --> 00:16:06,551
I was wondering, sir, how will I be getting there?

111
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:09,256
You think I don't know?

112
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:11,365
- No, sir.
- You think that.

113
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:13,626
- It's just that I don't know...
- Hold your tongue.

114
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:16,327
I am in a generous mood
and I will grant your boon.

115
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:18,441
See that peasant out there?

116
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:20,366
He calls himself Timmons.

117
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:24,345
He's going there this very afternoon.
You can ride with him if you like.

118
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:28,008
He knows the way. Thank you. That is all.

119
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:42,131
Sir Knight?

120
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:48,202
I've just pissed in my pants...

121
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:52,781
...and nobody can do anything about it.

122
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,892
To your journey!

123
00:17:13,976 --> 00:17:15,375
To my journey!

124
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,258
Haw!

125
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,773
Over a little bit, Jim!

126
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:43,102
- Have this by tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

127
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,110
I'll have my crown now.

128
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,347
- Sir?
- I'll have my crown now!

129
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:53,621
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Are you deaf, fool?

130
00:17:53,825 --> 00:17:56,157
I said I'll have my crown right now!

131
00:17:56,328 --> 00:17:57,317
Now!

132
00:18:01,701 --> 00:18:02,565
No.

133
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:05,966
- I'll get your crown.
- No.

134
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,183
Sir?

135
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:20,113
Major?

136
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:26,353
The king is dead.

137
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:32,898
Long live the king.

138
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,299
Get these kids out of here, come on!

139
00:19:15,024 --> 00:19:16,582
Haw, Jim and Jake!

140
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:23,167
Gee a little bit, Jim!

141
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:05,286
The hell was that?

142
00:21:06,794 --> 00:21:08,159
What is that?

143
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:15,698
What the hell is that?

144
00:21:41,036 --> 00:21:43,402
Why don't you put that in your book?

145
00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:54,651
Were it not for my companion...

146
00:21:54,786 --> 00:21:57,311
...I believe I would be having the time of my life.

147
00:21:57,523 --> 00:21:58,820
I know he means well...

148
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:02,119
...but he is quite possibly
the foulest man I have ever met.

149
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:39,072
How far you make the Fort?

150
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,540
Far.

151
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,611
How far?

152
00:22:45,716 --> 00:22:47,547
Forty, fifty mile, maybe.

153
00:22:48,518 --> 00:22:50,748
What's the big hurry on Sedgewick?

154
00:22:51,723 --> 00:22:53,350
It's to be my post.

155
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,886
My home.

156
00:23:01,368 --> 00:23:03,768
You ain't hard to please, I'll give you that much.

157
00:23:09,177 --> 00:23:10,508
Look yonder.

158
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:23,619
What you got there?

159
00:23:35,043 --> 00:23:38,206
Somebody back east is saying,
Why don't she write?

160
00:23:40,783 --> 00:23:42,375
You stupid bastard.

161
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,700
Get up, Timmons.

162
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,742
Get up.

163
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:19,333
Get up.

164
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:22,128
Come on. Get up.

165
00:25:25,944 --> 00:25:28,139
Get up!

166
00:25:34,121 --> 00:25:36,919
Someone poked me in my butt. Was that you?

167
00:25:37,358 --> 00:25:38,655
Goddamn it!

168
00:25:41,197 --> 00:25:42,892
I'm gonna have a welt.

169
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,157
Cpl. Guest?

170
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:15,035
You don't have to talk to me,
just please come out.

171
00:27:36,403 --> 00:27:37,597
It's the end.

172
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:41,870
Assemble the men in front of my quarters.

173
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,487
You hate me.

174
00:27:55,494 --> 00:27:57,894
But I feel none of the same for you.

175
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,232
You men stayed.

176
00:28:04,005 --> 00:28:06,735
You stayed after they took all our horses.

177
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:11,477
You stayed after all the others deserted.

178
00:28:13,516 --> 00:28:16,485
You stayed after the army failed to resupply us.

179
00:28:20,424 --> 00:28:23,188
I have looked for that wagon from Fort Hayes...

180
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:24,860
...just as you have...

181
00:28:25,397 --> 00:28:27,262
...day after miserable day.

182
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,061
And all I can say is that I'm proud of you.

183
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:38,237
Now get your things, men.
Were leaving this place.

184
00:28:39,247 --> 00:28:40,839
The army can go to hell.

185
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:46,085
Go.

186
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:47,956
Get your things.

187
00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:30,073
How come we haven't seen any buffalo?

188
00:29:30,577 --> 00:29:32,545
You can't figure the stinking buffalo.

189
00:29:33,113 --> 00:29:35,946
You can't.
Sometimes you won't see any for days.

190
00:29:36,117 --> 00:29:39,348
Other times, they'll be thick,
like curls on a whore.

191
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:44,020
What about Indians?

192
00:29:44,227 --> 00:29:46,491
Indians? Goddamn Indians!

193
00:29:46,997 --> 00:29:50,433
You just as soon not see em
unless the bastards are dead.

194
00:29:50,601 --> 00:29:52,967
They're nothing but thieves and beggars.

195
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:54,670
Ho, up there!

196
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:27,376
Not what you would call
much of a going concern now, is it?

197
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:33,453
Go down there.

198
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,595
- Why? There ain't nothing down there.
- Because I said.

199
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:39,292
Go down there.

200
00:31:44,474 --> 00:31:46,066
There, son of a bitch!

201
00:32:12,675 --> 00:32:14,540
There ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.

202
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:37,599
There ain't nothing here, Lieutenant.

203
00:32:42,511 --> 00:32:43,773
Lieutenant!

204
00:32:45,414 --> 00:32:47,439
Everybodys run off or got killed.

205
00:33:05,906 --> 00:33:09,000
All right. Lets unload the wagon.

206
00:33:09,811 --> 00:33:12,041
What? What, and leave it all here?

207
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,274
I'm staying, too.

208
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:17,715
There ain't nothing here.

209
00:33:18,489 --> 00:33:20,821
No, not at the moment.

210
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,289
We don't know what's happened.

211
00:33:25,764 --> 00:33:27,629
Things being as they are...

212
00:33:28,534 --> 00:33:31,526
...we might as well
just turn around and get headed back.

213
00:33:31,805 --> 00:33:32,999
This is my post.

214
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:34,366
This is my post?

215
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:36,131
This is my post.

216
00:33:38,212 --> 00:33:39,372
This is my post?

217
00:33:39,782 --> 00:33:41,113
Jesus H. Christ.

218
00:33:41,283 --> 00:33:42,841
What, are you crazy, boy?

219
00:33:46,489 --> 00:33:48,184
Fast son of a bitch.

220
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:51,052
- Jesus H. Christ.
- This is my post.

221
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:52,627
All right, put it down.

222
00:33:52,763 --> 00:33:56,392
And these are the post provisions, all right?
Now get your ass off the wagon...

223
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:58,593
- Put it down!
- And help me unload.

224
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:01,365
Were just havin a conversation,
now put it down.

225
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:54,867
I'll let them know where you are.

226
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,629
Good.

227
00:34:59,311 --> 00:35:00,437
Good luck.

228
00:35:02,749 --> 00:35:03,841
Thank you.

229
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,721
Jake and Jim!

230
00:35:21,138 --> 00:35:22,537
Good mule!

231
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:24,702
Haw up there now!

232
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,242
Good mules!

233
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:18,401
Have arrived to find Fort Sedgewick deserted.

234
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:22,306
Am now waiting for garrisons return
or word from headquarters.

235
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,573
The post is in exceedingly poor condition...

236
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:28,583
...and I have decided to assign myself
clean-up duty beginning tomorrow.

237
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,514
Supplies are abundant...

238
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,386
...and the country
is everything I dreamed it would be.

239
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,188
There can be no place like this on Earth.

240
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:36,604
Bad horse.

241
00:38:37,478 --> 00:38:38,706
Bad horse.

242
00:41:45,942 --> 00:41:48,274
The animals in the pond
had not been poisoned.

243
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:50,037
They had all been shot.

244
00:41:50,214 --> 00:41:52,409
But why? Was it for sport?

245
00:41:53,018 --> 00:41:55,077
Could it have been out of spite?

246
00:41:55,286 --> 00:41:58,153
My first guess would have been
that the men here were starving.

247
00:41:58,357 --> 00:42:01,224
But this rotting waste speaks to the contrary.

248
00:42:01,695 --> 00:42:04,129
The caves are an even bigger mystery.

249
00:42:04,331 --> 00:42:07,027
What could have driven men to live in caves?

250
00:42:07,235 --> 00:42:09,066
Perhaps they were frightened.

251
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:11,797
Maybe there had been some sort of revolt.

252
00:42:12,274 --> 00:42:15,334
I can make no sense of the clues left me here.

253
00:42:15,612 --> 00:42:16,579
Perhaps my relief will provide the answers.

254
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:29,927
Come on, Cisco. One more time.

255
00:42:30,096 --> 00:42:31,188
Git up!

256
00:42:32,398 --> 00:42:34,195
Come on! Git up, Cisco.

257
00:42:37,906 --> 00:42:38,998
Git up!

258
00:42:40,442 --> 00:42:41,704
Git up! There you go!

259
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:43,141
Easy.

260
00:43:20,624 --> 00:43:26,928
Only a white man would make a fire
for everyone to see.

261
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,391
Maybe theres more than one.

262
00:43:30,603 --> 00:43:33,071
There might be three or four.

263
00:43:34,007 --> 00:43:35,474
I know three or four...

264
00:43:35,676 --> 00:43:38,042
...who will not be making the trip back home.

265
00:43:38,212 --> 00:43:41,147
We have nothing to show for this trail.

266
00:43:42,651 --> 00:43:44,312
We have no rifles.

267
00:43:44,487 --> 00:43:46,580
White men are sure to have rifles.

268
00:43:48,091 --> 00:43:51,720
It's hard to say how many might be down there.

269
00:43:58,938 --> 00:44:01,338
We should forget this and go home.

270
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:03,271
Then go.

271
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:06,043
I would rather die...

272
00:44:06,246 --> 00:44:09,909
...than argue about a single line of smoke
in my own country.

273
00:44:20,665 --> 00:44:24,101
He will not quit until we are all dead.

274
00:44:38,086 --> 00:44:39,576
And if I...

275
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,803
Look at me.

276
00:45:57,449 --> 00:45:59,417
Don't hurt my mules.

277
00:46:05,326 --> 00:46:06,452
Stop.

278
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,724
Stop it.

279
00:46:32,726 --> 00:46:34,717
Please don't hurt my mules.

280
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:35,460
I am pleased with my efforts thus far.

281
00:47:35,636 --> 00:47:40,096
For all my improvements, though,
there remains an ugliness here I cannot dispel.

282
00:47:40,308 --> 00:47:44,677
An injury that goes beyond neglect
and like a bruise, it will be slow to heal.

283
00:48:39,915 --> 00:48:41,780
It's been almost 30 days.

284
00:48:42,017 --> 00:48:45,475
I have come to enjoy
the patterns of my life at Fort Sedgewick.

285
00:48:45,655 --> 00:48:48,624
Especially my daily
reconnaissance rides with Cisco.

286
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,460
Each day, we go further into the prairie
and every discovery...

287
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:55,928
...big or small,
becomes etched in my mind forever.

288
00:48:56,568 --> 00:49:00,060
It would seem I've been marooned,
as no one has yet come for me.

289
00:49:00,173 --> 00:49:04,337
I can only assume that there is a problem,
which the army will solve shortly.

290
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:07,474
Maybe I am being foolish in my optimism...

291
00:49:08,116 --> 00:49:10,380
...but when I look to the eastern horizon...

292
00:49:10,685 --> 00:49:13,813
...I never fail to hope
that a column might be out there.

293
00:49:21,632 --> 00:49:24,362
Still no sign of Capt. Cargills command.

294
00:49:24,736 --> 00:49:27,204
Though well-supplied,
I've decided to ration my goods...

295
00:49:27,406 --> 00:49:30,773
...as if I were part
of a post instead of the whole affair.

296
00:49:32,078 --> 00:49:35,479
Theres a wolf who seems intent
on the goings-on here.

297
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:39,018
He does not seem inclined
to be a nuisance, however.

298
00:49:39,221 --> 00:49:42,190
And aside from Cisco,
has been my only company.

299
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:45,688
He's appeared
each afternoon for the past two days.

300
00:49:46,028 --> 00:49:48,019
He has two milky white paws.

301
00:49:49,466 --> 00:49:51,491
If he comes calling tomorrow...

302
00:49:51,803 --> 00:49:53,828
...I will name him Two-Socks.

303
00:51:45,775 --> 00:51:48,107
Almost a month and no one has come.

304
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:50,206
The longer this condition persists...

305
00:51:50,381 --> 00:51:53,373
...the less inclined I am
to believe that anyone will.

306
00:51:53,752 --> 00:51:56,687
Rain has forced me indoors
for most of two days now...

307
00:51:56,856 --> 00:51:58,949
...and I have begun work on an awning.

308
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:05,655
It is the loneliest of times for me now...

309
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:08,859
...but I can say honestly
that I am not unhappy.

310
00:52:57,362 --> 00:53:01,264
How can I marry a pretty little girl

311
00:53:01,434 --> 00:53:03,800
When I got no coat to put on?

312
00:53:04,939 --> 00:53:06,600
Soldier, soldier

313
00:53:06,774 --> 00:53:08,537
Wont you marry me

314
00:53:08,944 --> 00:53:11,139
Before the fight comes home?

315
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,749
How can I marry a pretty little girl

316
00:53:15,418 --> 00:53:17,682
When I got no shoes to put on?

317
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:36,031
How can I marry a pretty little girl

318
00:53:36,644 --> 00:53:38,839
When I got no hat to put on?

319
00:54:02,709 --> 00:54:05,507
Soldier, soldier, won't you marry me

320
00:54:05,746 --> 00:54:07,941
Before the fight comes home?

321
00:54:08,283 --> 00:54:10,877
How can I marry an ugly little girl

322
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,485
When I got a pretty wife back home?

323
00:55:14,464 --> 00:55:15,692
You there!

324
00:55:59,085 --> 00:56:01,645
Have made first contact with a wild Indian.

325
00:56:01,821 --> 00:56:04,881
One came to the fort
and tried to steal my horse.

326
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:07,719
When I appeared,
he became frightened and ran off.

327
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:12,657
Have decided to bury excess ordnance
lest it fall into enemy hands.

328
00:56:12,868 --> 00:56:15,860
Keeping only the barest necessities for myself.

329
00:56:21,345 --> 00:56:24,610
My afternoon rides have been pared down
to short circular patrols...

330
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:26,875
...always keeping the post in sight.

331
00:56:27,853 --> 00:56:30,981
Am taking steps to prepare
for another visitation.

332
00:56:31,224 --> 00:56:33,658
Do not know how many more
might be in the vicinity...

333
00:56:33,827 --> 00:56:37,228
...but am assuming that where there is one
theres sure to be another.

334
00:56:40,102 --> 00:56:43,037
Most of my work has been geared
toward creating the illusion...

335
00:56:43,205 --> 00:56:44,968
...of strength and stability.

336
00:56:46,275 --> 00:56:49,733
I'm still alone, however,
and unless troops arrive soon...

337
00:56:49,913 --> 00:56:50,140
...all may be lost.

338
00:57:07,468 --> 00:57:11,495
Kicking Bird has been keeping to himself
these last few days.

339
00:57:13,142 --> 00:57:17,135
I do not like to see our medicine man
walking so alone.

340
00:57:19,583 --> 00:57:21,744
What does his wife say?

341
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:24,547
She says that he is keeping to himself.

342
00:57:24,823 --> 00:57:27,155
Thats not what I asked you.

343
00:57:27,325 --> 00:57:28,849
Well, what did you ask me?

344
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:31,019
What did she say?

345
00:57:31,164 --> 00:57:34,292
She said that he is keeping
to himself these days.

346
00:57:35,669 --> 00:57:37,534
Thats what she says.

347
00:57:39,207 --> 00:57:41,869
Make sure that my meat is soft.

348
00:57:42,044 --> 00:57:44,308
My teeth hurt.

349
00:57:54,525 --> 00:57:56,493
May I come in?

350
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:12,077
No, let him sit with me.

351
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:20,055
Our country seems good this summer...

352
00:58:20,224 --> 00:58:24,558
...but I have not been out to see it.

353
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:29,422
But the buffalo are late.

354
00:58:29,635 --> 00:58:33,127
And I always worry
about the bellies of our children.

355
00:58:36,177 --> 00:58:38,805
I was thinking of a dance.

356
00:58:39,013 --> 00:58:42,710
Yes. A dance is always a good idea.

357
00:58:42,885 --> 00:58:48,017
It would be good to have a strong sign.

358
00:59:02,776 --> 00:59:05,870
Theres a funny thing about signs.

359
00:59:06,013 --> 00:59:08,504
We know when they are bad or good.

360
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:14,320
Sometimes they are strange
and it's hard to understand them.

361
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:17,186
A smart man will think on these things.

362
00:59:18,428 --> 00:59:22,296
If he is still confused, he will tell somebody.

363
00:59:22,967 --> 00:59:25,026
For instance, he might tell you or me.

364
00:59:25,203 --> 00:59:27,068
A smart man always does this.

365
00:59:32,812 --> 00:59:35,542
I have seen such a sign.

366
00:59:37,117 --> 00:59:38,106
Really?

367
00:59:52,203 --> 00:59:54,569
I saw a man.

368
00:59:54,739 --> 00:59:57,708
A naked, white man.

369
00:59:57,876 --> 00:59:59,400
Are you sure it was a man?

370
01:00:01,815 --> 01:00:03,840
I saw his sex.

371
01:00:06,287 --> 01:00:07,720
Did you speak to him?

372
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:11,614
No.

373
01:00:26,745 --> 01:00:29,009
It's been two days now, and nothing.

374
01:00:29,181 --> 01:00:32,150
My presence here must
have been reported by now.

375
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:35,117
Have made all the preparations I can think of.

376
01:00:35,288 --> 01:00:36,414
Cannot mount an adequate defense
as I am still alone.

377
01:00:37,892 --> 01:00:40,452
But will try to make
a big impression when they come.

378
01:00:40,763 --> 01:00:41,889
Waiting.

379
01:00:42,464 --> 01:00:43,658
Post-script...

380
01:00:43,832 --> 01:00:47,199
The man I encountered was
a magnificent-looking fellow.

381
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:01,847
He might be a god.

382
01:01:02,021 --> 01:01:06,823
Or a white chief with special abilities.

383
01:01:06,994 --> 01:01:09,258
That is why we should talk with him.

384
01:01:12,034 --> 01:01:14,696
I do not care for this talk about this white man.

385
01:01:15,354 --> 01:01:19,083
Whatever he is, he is not a Sioux,
and that makes him less.

386
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:23,554
When I hear that more whites are coming,
I want to laugh.

387
01:01:23,693 --> 01:01:25,922
We took a hundred horses from these people.

388
01:01:26,128 --> 01:01:28,425
There was no honor in it.

389
01:01:29,263 --> 01:01:31,196
They don't ride well. They don't shoot well.

390
01:01:31,365 --> 01:01:34,060
They're dirty.

391
01:01:34,234 --> 01:01:37,929
Those soldiers could not even make it
through one winter here.

392
01:01:39,203 --> 01:01:40,965
And these people are said to flourish?

393
01:01:41,172 --> 01:01:43,571
I think they will all be dead soon.

394
01:01:46,108 --> 01:01:49,667
I think this fool is probably lost.

395
01:01:55,248 --> 01:01:58,704
Wind In His Hairs words are strong
and I have heard them.

396
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:01,647
It's true the whites are a poor race
and hard to understand.

397
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,119
But make no mistake. The whites are coming.

398
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:07,346
Even our enemies agree on this.

399
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:11,083
So when I see one man alone
without fear in our country...

400
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:15,922
...I do not think he is lost.
I think he may have medicine.

401
01:02:16,129 --> 01:02:19,460
I see someone who might speak...

402
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:22,726
...for all the white people who are coming.

403
01:02:22,934 --> 01:02:27,164
I think this is a person
with which treaties might be struck.

404
01:02:29,672 --> 01:02:36,438
Kicking Bird is always looking ahead
and that is good.

405
01:02:36,644 --> 01:02:40,703
But this man cannot cover our lodges
or feed our children.

406
01:02:40,914 --> 01:02:44,575
He is nothing to us.

407
01:02:44,716 --> 01:02:46,376
I will take some men.

408
01:02:46,551 --> 01:02:48,575
We will shoot some arrows into this white man.

409
01:02:48,752 --> 01:02:52,277
If he truly has medicine, he will not be hurt.

410
01:02:52,455 --> 01:02:55,082
If he has no medicine, he will be dead.

411
01:03:00,561 --> 01:03:03,960
No man can tell another what to do.

412
01:03:04,162 --> 01:03:07,459
But killing a white man is a delicate matter.

413
01:03:07,632 --> 01:03:11,566
If you kill one, more are sure to come.

414
01:03:17,072 --> 01:03:21,598
It's easy to become confused
by these questions.

415
01:03:21,775 --> 01:03:24,208
It's hard to know what to do.

416
01:03:25,911 --> 01:03:29,743
We should talk about this some more.

417
01:03:30,881 --> 01:03:33,576
That is all I have to say.

418
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:10,504
What's the matter, now?

419
01:04:10,642 --> 01:04:13,201
We don't think this is such a good idea.

420
01:04:14,545 --> 01:04:16,068
If we take the horse of a white god...

421
01:04:16,479 --> 01:04:18,605
...they will make up songs about us.

422
01:04:19,749 --> 01:04:20,612
Maybe.

423
01:04:21,917 --> 01:04:24,077
They will ask us to go on raids.

424
01:04:24,218 --> 01:04:27,152
Who gets the horse?

425
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,183
I do.

426
01:04:29,489 --> 01:04:34,652
I do, but we share. Now who can say
this is not a great plan?

427
01:04:38,829 --> 01:04:40,921
It's always the same.

428
01:04:41,864 --> 01:04:43,490
Every time.

429
01:04:50,003 --> 01:04:52,402
Yes, sir, I have. No, I'll ask, sir.

430
01:05:17,089 --> 01:05:19,318
Well be heroes.

431
01:05:22,525 --> 01:05:24,651
Theyll write songs about us.

432
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:39,869
What happened?

433
01:05:44,174 --> 01:05:48,233
I don't know. My arm doesn't work.

434
01:05:50,979 --> 01:05:54,538
You shouldnt have fallen off.
Now we'll get in trouble.

435
01:05:55,249 --> 01:05:57,239
It was your idea.

436
01:05:57,417 --> 01:06:02,717
My idea was only to take the horse,
not fall down.

437
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:09,357
Otter hurt himself.

438
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:14,524
What are you looking at?
I'm the one who's hurt.

439
01:06:14,763 --> 01:06:19,061
I will be when my father finds out.
His bow will be across my back.

440
01:08:42,966 --> 01:08:45,900
I am Wind In His Hair.

441
01:08:47,101 --> 01:08:49,534
I am Wind In His Hair.

442
01:08:50,637 --> 01:08:53,934
Do you see that I am not afraid of you?

443
01:08:54,273 --> 01:08:55,671
Do you see?

444
01:10:08,958 --> 01:10:12,289
The party that went against the Utes
is coming back.

445
01:10:13,061 --> 01:10:16,392
There are many hearts on the ground.

446
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:54,193
I realize now that I have been wrong.

447
01:11:54,365 --> 01:11:56,229
All this time, I've been waiting.

448
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,832
Waiting for what?

449
01:11:58,001 --> 01:11:59,399
For someone to find me?

450
01:11:59,535 --> 01:12:01,195
For Indians to take my horse?

451
01:12:01,403 --> 01:12:02,926
To see a buffalo?

452
01:12:03,138 --> 01:12:06,334
Since I have arrived at this post
I have been walking on eggs.

453
01:12:06,507 --> 01:12:09,236
It has become a bad habit and I am sick of it.

454
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:11,740
Tomorrow morning,
I will ride out to the Indians.

455
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,400
I do not know the outcome
or wisdom of this thinking...

456
01:12:14,579 --> 01:12:18,069
...but I've become a target
and a target makes a poor impression.

457
01:12:18,248 --> 01:12:19,942
I am through waiting.

458
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:22,946
What are you looking at?

459
01:13:53,881 --> 01:13:55,347
Son of a bitch!

460
01:14:08,358 --> 01:14:09,517
No. Wait.

461
01:14:10,693 --> 01:14:11,716
Wait.

462
01:14:14,262 --> 01:14:15,228
Wait.

463
01:14:18,632 --> 01:14:20,258
You need help. Youre hurt.

464
01:14:20,433 --> 01:14:22,366
- You need...
- No!

465
01:14:24,403 --> 01:14:26,870
Let me... You need help.

466
01:14:27,271 --> 01:14:30,239
You need help. Youre hurt. Let me help you.

467
01:14:34,844 --> 01:14:36,140
Youre hurt.

468
01:14:41,348 --> 01:14:42,439
Don't.

469
01:18:01,854 --> 01:18:03,115
She's hurt.

470
01:18:09,759 --> 01:18:11,020
She's hurt.

471
01:18:22,102 --> 01:18:24,365
You are not welcome here.

472
01:18:28,139 --> 01:18:30,368
No. She's hurt.

473
01:18:32,609 --> 01:18:34,974
Go away from us.

474
01:18:43,549 --> 01:18:46,880
You are not welcome. Go away from us.

475
01:19:29,281 --> 01:19:31,145
Stop.

476
01:19:31,317 --> 01:19:34,444
The soldier did not come to fight.

477
01:19:34,652 --> 01:19:37,814
He is going away and we will let him.

478
01:20:03,472 --> 01:20:06,634
I am in agreement with Kicking Bird.

479
01:20:07,642 --> 01:20:10,201
We will go down and talk to the white man.

480
01:20:11,378 --> 01:20:14,244
And find out why he is here.

481
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:26,487
If this council decides to talk to the white man...

482
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,747
...then it will be so.

483
01:20:28,923 --> 01:20:30,787
But in my mind it's not right...

484
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:32,686
...that a chief as great as Ten Bears...

485
01:20:32,859 --> 01:20:35,884
...goes to ask the business of a puny,
trespassing white man...

486
01:20:36,061 --> 01:20:40,689
...who has only a smart horse
and a few white mans clothes.

487
01:20:42,566 --> 01:20:44,157
I will not go.

488
01:20:45,067 --> 01:20:46,897
You will go.

489
01:20:52,506 --> 01:20:54,735
And you will go.

490
01:20:56,008 --> 01:20:58,805
That is all I have to say.

491
01:21:19,425 --> 01:21:20,550
Welcome.

492
01:21:21,659 --> 01:21:22,784
Welcome.

493
01:21:25,129 --> 01:21:25,992
Hi!

494
01:21:33,335 --> 01:21:34,301
Come.

495
01:21:35,269 --> 01:21:36,792
Please, sit down.

496
01:21:37,837 --> 01:21:38,894
Sit down.

497
01:22:03,789 --> 01:22:05,779
Wait just a... Just a minute.

498
01:22:11,027 --> 01:22:12,960
His mind is gone.

499
01:22:41,015 --> 01:22:42,606
Tatanka. Buffalo.

500
01:22:43,716 --> 01:22:45,444
- Buffalo.
- Tatanka.

501
01:22:53,223 --> 01:22:54,780
Buffalo. Tatanka.

502
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:00,822
The fierce one, as I call him,
seems a very tough fellow.

503
01:23:00,995 --> 01:23:02,757
I hope I never have to fight him.

504
01:23:02,930 --> 01:23:06,420
From the little I know,
he seems to be honest and very direct.

505
01:23:06,599 --> 01:23:08,725
I like the quiet one immensely.

506
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:10,697
He's been patient and inquisitive.

507
01:23:10,869 --> 01:23:12,893
He seems eager to communicate.

508
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:16,197
I would conclude that he is a man
of some weight among his people.

509
01:23:16,406 --> 01:23:17,565
Buffalo.

510
01:23:25,812 --> 01:23:28,905
I believe I made an even greater impression
on their next visit.

511
01:23:29,048 --> 01:23:33,176
I produced a coffee grinder,
something none of them had seen before.

512
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:16,641
Is the coffee not good?

513
01:24:18,083 --> 01:24:19,549
It's too strong, maybe.

514
01:24:22,585 --> 01:24:23,642
Sugar.

515
01:24:24,888 --> 01:24:25,979
Put in.

516
01:24:35,895 --> 01:24:37,054
Taste it.

517
01:24:48,503 --> 01:24:49,560
Sugar.

518
01:24:50,705 --> 01:24:52,103
You want some?

519
01:24:52,773 --> 01:24:54,171
You want some?

520
01:25:00,279 --> 01:25:01,575
Thats a lot.

521
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:08,946
Okay.

522
01:25:09,852 --> 01:25:10,715
Yeah.

523
01:25:15,289 --> 01:25:17,518
It's good to finally have some company.

524
01:25:17,723 --> 01:25:20,589
So much goes unsaid
and I have the feeling that these people...

525
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:23,523
...the quiet one in particular,
want something from me.

526
01:25:23,695 --> 01:25:25,958
Made presents of coffee and most of the sugar.

527
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:28,256
It didnt figure to last anyway.

528
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:30,226
Don't believe I go too far in saying...

529
01:25:30,433 --> 01:25:33,128
...that a foundation
for good relations is being laid.

530
01:26:08,292 --> 01:26:10,725
Stands With A Fist.

531
01:26:14,563 --> 01:26:17,053
We will talk awhile.

532
01:26:25,638 --> 01:26:28,504
Your wounds are healing well?

533
01:26:29,941 --> 01:26:32,602
Yes, they are.

534
01:26:35,945 --> 01:26:38,435
You are happy here, with my family?

535
01:26:38,614 --> 01:26:40,843
I am glad to be here.

536
01:26:41,682 --> 01:26:45,081
I am missing my husband.

537
01:26:47,753 --> 01:26:50,915
Perhaps you will marry again
when the time is right?

538
01:26:51,055 --> 01:26:52,282
Perhaps.

539
01:26:57,627 --> 01:27:02,653
We have word from many places
that the whites are coming.

540
01:27:04,198 --> 01:27:06,461
They are coming into everyones country.

541
01:27:06,633 --> 01:27:08,623
I think they will soon be in ours.

542
01:27:09,068 --> 01:27:11,535
This white man
who lives at the old soldier fort...

543
01:27:11,703 --> 01:27:14,535
I have visited him
and I believe his heart is a good one.

544
01:27:21,176 --> 01:27:23,871
I am afraid of the white man at the fort.

545
01:27:24,779 --> 01:27:28,338
I am afraid he will tell others that I am here.

546
01:27:28,515 --> 01:27:30,778
I am afraid they will try to take me away.

547
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:33,884
I've heard they take people away.

548
01:27:34,052 --> 01:27:36,679
Every warrior in camp
would fight them if they tried.

549
01:27:36,854 --> 01:27:39,481
I cannot make the white man language.

550
01:27:39,656 --> 01:27:41,816
He cannot speak Sioux.

551
01:27:43,025 --> 01:27:46,221
It has been a long time since I made the talk.

552
01:27:46,427 --> 01:27:48,394
I want you to try.

553
01:27:49,096 --> 01:27:50,619
I don't know how.

554
01:27:50,797 --> 01:27:52,229
Yes, you do.

555
01:27:52,431 --> 01:27:53,920
I can't.

556
01:27:55,267 --> 01:27:57,393
I can't. It's dead in me.

557
01:27:58,569 --> 01:28:02,867
I don't ask this for myself.
I ask this for all the people.

558
01:28:03,005 --> 01:28:05,996
He knows things about the whites
which we do not.

559
01:28:06,174 --> 01:28:08,471
Now, you must remember.

560
01:28:12,012 --> 01:28:13,876
I can't.

561
01:28:24,721 --> 01:28:27,780
Will she make the white words?

562
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:31,785
She won't try. She is being difficult.

563
01:28:32,492 --> 01:28:34,982
Well, she's the one who's crying.

564
01:28:35,128 --> 01:28:38,392
Perhaps the difficulty is yours.

565
01:29:44,909 --> 01:29:46,136
Christine!

566
01:30:01,788 --> 01:30:03,982
Get em, Joe! Get them chickens!

567
01:30:06,792 --> 01:30:09,316
Billy, you get away from those puppies!

568
01:30:16,098 --> 01:30:17,086
Damn!

569
01:30:17,832 --> 01:30:20,356
Get the kids, and get them in the house.

570
01:30:21,802 --> 01:30:22,859
Go on!

571
01:30:25,404 --> 01:30:26,631
Christine!

572
01:30:27,706 --> 01:30:30,299
Christine! Where are you?

573
01:30:32,243 --> 01:30:33,937
I'm up here, mother.

574
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:35,940
- Get down now.
- Why?

575
01:30:36,112 --> 01:30:37,408
Just do it.

576
01:30:45,485 --> 01:30:49,078
Stay right where you are. Get back.
Do you hear me?

577
01:30:50,222 --> 01:30:52,416
Joe, get in the house right now!

578
01:30:59,529 --> 01:31:00,552
Willie!

579
01:31:01,263 --> 01:31:04,560
- Who is it, Willie?
- They look like Pawnee.

580
01:31:04,732 --> 01:31:07,564
My father and your father are talking to them.

581
01:31:08,468 --> 01:31:10,935
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

582
01:31:11,804 --> 01:31:14,294
Go on. You heard him. Get out of here.

583
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:28,913
Run, Christine!

584
01:31:29,383 --> 01:31:31,247
I said run!

585
01:31:34,052 --> 01:31:35,382
Joe!

586
01:31:51,531 --> 01:31:52,758
Christine!

587
01:32:04,774 --> 01:32:06,138
Mommy!

588
01:32:45,236 --> 01:32:47,965
Come on, Two Socks. Bacon.

589
01:32:48,137 --> 01:32:51,299
Two Socks, like Cisco,
has become a trusted friend.

590
01:32:51,607 --> 01:32:53,699
He still won't eat from my hand...

591
01:32:53,841 --> 01:32:58,003
...but his keen eyes and ears
never fail to alert me when something is wrong.

592
01:33:23,428 --> 01:33:24,553
Tatanka.

593
01:33:26,697 --> 01:33:27,560
No.

594
01:33:27,899 --> 01:33:30,025
No, I haven't seen any buffalo.

595
01:33:31,001 --> 01:33:32,058
Sorry.

596
01:33:51,115 --> 01:33:53,082
Are you hungry?

597
01:33:55,083 --> 01:33:56,515
Are you hungry?

598
01:33:57,085 --> 01:34:00,247
I have food. I have a lot of food.

599
01:34:23,938 --> 01:34:26,633
Nothing I've been told
about these people is correct.

600
01:34:26,806 --> 01:34:28,466
They are not beggars and thieves.

601
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:31,437
They are not the bogeymen
they've been made out to be.

602
01:34:31,676 --> 01:34:35,804
On the contrary, they are polite guests
and have a familiar humor I enjoy.

603
01:34:35,979 --> 01:34:38,037
Real communication is slow, however...

604
01:34:38,213 --> 01:34:40,942
...and the quiet one is as frustrated as I am.

605
01:34:41,115 --> 01:34:43,912
Most of our progress
has been built on the basis of failure...

606
01:34:44,084 --> 01:34:45,880
...rather than success.

607
01:34:46,053 --> 01:34:49,851
I've thought to inquire
if the woman I found lived or not...

608
01:34:50,222 --> 01:34:53,883
...but it seems far too complicated a subject,
given our limitations.

609
01:34:54,091 --> 01:34:56,718
One thing is clear, however.
There are no buffalo.

610
01:34:56,894 --> 01:34:59,225
And it weighs heavy on their minds.

611
01:34:59,529 --> 01:35:01,689
Yesterdays meeting was the best yet.

612
01:35:01,897 --> 01:35:06,093
It seems I've been invited to the village
and I'm looking forward to going.

613
01:36:34,261 --> 01:36:35,693
We were waiting for you.

614
01:36:48,638 --> 01:36:51,037
We were waiting for you.

615
01:36:51,173 --> 01:36:54,732
Now tell him we are glad that he is here.

616
01:37:00,079 --> 01:37:01,238
Hello.

617
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:03,637
You...

618
01:37:04,516 --> 01:37:05,607
Here...

619
01:37:08,419 --> 01:37:09,442
Good.

620
01:37:13,055 --> 01:37:15,045
Thank you. I feel good.

621
01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:16,753
I feel good.

622
01:37:19,959 --> 01:37:23,654
Ask him why he is at the soldier fort.

623
01:37:27,565 --> 01:37:31,761
The soldier fort.

624
01:37:32,701 --> 01:37:33,724
Wait.

625
01:37:35,904 --> 01:37:37,530
What is your names?

626
01:37:38,705 --> 01:37:41,537
- Our names?
- What is his name?

627
01:37:46,445 --> 01:37:51,779
He's right. Introductions should come first.

628
01:37:54,551 --> 01:37:55,710
He...

629
01:37:57,519 --> 01:37:58,678
He...

630
01:37:59,821 --> 01:38:00,752
Kick.

631
01:38:01,422 --> 01:38:02,854
Kick?

632
01:38:03,523 --> 01:38:04,489
More.

633
01:38:04,891 --> 01:38:05,948
More kick?

634
01:38:06,492 --> 01:38:07,856
More kicking?

635
01:38:08,393 --> 01:38:09,518
Kicking.

636
01:38:11,795 --> 01:38:14,194
Bird? Bird, kicking bird.

637
01:38:14,364 --> 01:38:15,921
Kicking Bird.

638
01:38:21,336 --> 01:38:22,597
What is he...

639
01:38:24,305 --> 01:38:25,601
Is he chief?

640
01:38:26,005 --> 01:38:26,936
No.

641
01:38:39,448 --> 01:38:42,007
A holy man.

642
01:38:42,584 --> 01:38:44,380
Holy man.

643
01:38:49,288 --> 01:38:50,151
Your name?

644
01:38:52,057 --> 01:38:54,718
- I don't...
- How are you called?

645
01:39:26,181 --> 01:39:27,477
Get up?

646
01:39:32,385 --> 01:39:33,408
Stand up?

647
01:39:34,953 --> 01:39:36,419
Stands?

648
01:39:37,588 --> 01:39:39,521
Stands. Your names Stands?

649
01:39:39,957 --> 01:39:41,389
Stands.

650
01:39:44,793 --> 01:39:46,760
- With.
- With?

651
01:39:46,929 --> 01:39:49,761
- With.
- Stands with?

652
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:54,088
Fist?

653
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:55,766
Yes.

654
01:39:56,402 --> 01:39:58,028
Stands With A Fist?

655
01:40:01,472 --> 01:40:03,063
Stands With A Fist.

656
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:05,129
I'm John Dunbar.

657
01:40:06,242 --> 01:40:08,209
John Dunbar.

658
01:40:14,781 --> 01:40:16,077
Dumb Bear.

659
01:40:17,049 --> 01:40:18,845
No, not Dumb Bear.

660
01:40:19,718 --> 01:40:20,809
Dunbar.

661
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:22,783
Dun...

662
01:40:22,987 --> 01:40:24,044
Bar.

663
01:40:24,421 --> 01:40:25,546
Not Dumb Bear.

664
01:40:25,722 --> 01:40:26,847
Dunbar.

665
01:40:44,335 --> 01:40:46,825
Theres been an exciting breakthrough
with the Indians.

666
01:40:46,970 --> 01:40:49,199
The woman I found
on the prairie speaks English...

667
01:40:49,406 --> 01:40:51,737
...and today, clear progress was made.

668
01:40:51,941 --> 01:40:55,898
She is white, and though I cannot be sure
how she came to be with these people...

669
01:40:56,077 --> 01:40:58,203
...I can tell she is not a captive.

670
01:40:58,612 --> 01:40:59,908
While I'm not afraid...

671
01:41:00,079 --> 01:41:02,842
...I don't feel completely
welcome by everyone in the village.

672
01:41:03,014 --> 01:41:05,709
My being here must be Kicking Birds idea.

673
01:41:06,217 --> 01:41:08,741
He is very enthusiastic and like two children...

674
01:41:08,886 --> 01:41:11,718
...we are both anxious
to know more about each other.

675
01:41:11,888 --> 01:41:14,014
But I find myself holding back.

676
01:41:14,223 --> 01:41:17,588
For some reason,
I am reluctant to answer all his questions.

677
01:41:17,725 --> 01:41:19,089
Maybe it's my sense of duty...

678
01:41:19,292 --> 01:41:21,816
...but something tells me not to say too much.

679
01:41:34,403 --> 01:41:36,495
It was good to see Fort Sedgewick again...

680
01:41:36,671 --> 01:41:40,400
...and yet I look forward
to another visit with my new neighbors.

681
01:41:43,309 --> 01:41:44,900
This is still my home, however...

682
01:41:45,044 --> 01:41:46,567
...and I remain watchful
for my relief and can only hope...

683
01:41:47,879 --> 01:41:52,041
...that my negotiations
with the wild people of the plains will bear fruit.

684
01:43:59,404 --> 01:44:00,165
Buffalo!

685
01:44:01,339 --> 01:44:04,205
Buffalo! I've seen buffalo!

686
01:44:34,795 --> 01:44:36,125
Buffaloes!

687
01:44:36,564 --> 01:44:37,928
Tatanka.

688
01:44:39,699 --> 01:44:40,995
Tatanka?

689
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:42,188
Yeah.

690
01:45:24,463 --> 01:45:27,158
Riders were sent out to pick up the trail.

691
01:45:27,432 --> 01:45:30,093
In the time it took to gather
my things at Sedgewick...

692
01:45:30,267 --> 01:45:32,700
...the entire tribe was well on its way.

693
01:45:33,069 --> 01:45:35,730
Their efficiency and speed
with which they moved...

694
01:45:35,872 --> 01:45:38,704
...was enough to impress
any military commander.

695
01:45:39,141 --> 01:45:42,836
Spirits are high, and overnight
I've gone from a person of suspicion...

696
01:45:42,976 --> 01:45:44,966
...to one of genuine standing.

697
01:45:45,311 --> 01:45:48,801
I am greeted with open smiles
and looks of appreciation.

698
01:45:48,947 --> 01:45:51,039
In short, I have become a celebrity.

699
01:45:51,249 --> 01:45:52,510
Loo ten tant!

700
01:45:52,816 --> 01:45:55,306
- Loo ten tant!
- Loo ten tant!

701
01:45:56,619 --> 01:45:59,644
Scouts picked up the trail
exactly where I said it would be.

702
01:46:00,522 --> 01:46:02,352
It was not hard to find...

703
01:46:02,523 --> 01:46:06,355
...a gigantic swath of torn-up ground
extending to the horizon.

704
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:09,619
The numbers it took to create
this impossible image...

705
01:46:09,795 --> 01:46:11,455
...was hard to imagine.

706
01:47:38,089 --> 01:47:39,350
Loo ten tant!

707
01:47:41,658 --> 01:47:42,919
Loo ten tant!

708
01:50:10,162 --> 01:50:12,095
Who would do such a thing?

709
01:50:12,264 --> 01:50:13,525
The field was proof enough...

710
01:50:13,664 --> 01:50:16,598
...that it was a people
without value and without soul.

711
01:50:16,933 --> 01:50:19,127
With no regard for Sioux rights.

712
01:50:19,768 --> 01:50:22,600
The wagon tracks
leading away left little doubt...

713
01:50:22,804 --> 01:50:26,397
...and my heart sank,
as I knew it could only be white hunters.

714
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:28,764
Voices that had been joyous all morning...

715
01:50:28,942 --> 01:50:32,876
...were now as silent
as the dead buffalo left to rot in this valley...

716
01:50:33,078 --> 01:50:36,637
...killed only for their tongues
and the price of their hides.

717
01:51:16,842 --> 01:51:18,103
Loo ten tant.

718
01:55:07,135 --> 01:55:09,694
It was suddenly clear now
what had happened...

719
01:55:09,870 --> 01:55:12,303
...and my heart sank
as I tried to convince myself...

720
01:55:12,438 --> 01:55:16,202
...that the white men who'd been killed
were bad people and deserved to die.

721
01:55:16,675 --> 01:55:18,107
But it was no use.

722
01:55:18,310 --> 01:55:21,073
I tried to believe
that Wind In His Hair and Kicking Bird...

723
01:55:21,245 --> 01:55:25,339
...and the others who shared in the killing
were not so happy for having done it.

724
01:55:25,514 --> 01:55:26,912
But they were.

725
01:55:28,917 --> 01:55:32,181
As I looked at familiar faces,
I realized that the gap between us...

726
01:55:32,319 --> 01:55:35,116
...was greater than I could ever have imagined.

727
01:55:54,936 --> 01:55:57,927
As they celebrated into the night
the coming hunt...

728
01:55:58,104 --> 01:56:00,230
...it was hard to know where to be.

729
01:56:00,906 --> 01:56:04,738
I don't know if they understood,
but I could not sleep among them.

730
01:56:04,976 --> 01:56:07,944
There had been no looks,
and there was no blame.

731
01:56:08,278 --> 01:56:09,676
There was only the confusion of a people
not able to predict a future.

732
02:03:04,967 --> 02:03:06,336
Are you all right?

733
02:04:55,523 --> 02:04:56,595
I can't.

734
02:04:57,779 --> 02:04:59,836
No, I'm full.

735
02:05:00,002 --> 02:05:03,111
I'm full, and I can't tell the story anymore.

736
02:05:15,507 --> 02:05:16,989
You want to try it?

737
02:05:17,923 --> 02:05:19,405
You want to try it?

738
02:05:22,007 --> 02:05:22,927
Here.

739
02:05:52,653 --> 02:05:54,428
I can't. This is too much.

740
02:06:01,864 --> 02:06:02,613
Good trade.

741
02:06:06,464 --> 02:06:07,728
This is a good trade.

742
02:06:13,417 --> 02:06:15,947
No, no, I can't. I'm full, I'm tired.

743
02:06:16,092 --> 02:06:17,024
No!

744
02:06:27,635 --> 02:06:29,698
Loo ten tant! Loo ten tant!

745
02:06:37,872 --> 02:06:40,071
Tatanka. Big tatanka.

746
02:06:40,247 --> 02:06:41,579
Big tatanka.

747
02:07:11,728 --> 02:07:12,696
Thats my hat!

748
02:07:23,237 --> 02:07:24,729
Youre wearing my hat.

749
02:07:28,790 --> 02:07:30,089
It's my hat.

750
02:07:30,463 --> 02:07:32,698
I found it on the prairie. It's mine.

751
02:07:35,315 --> 02:07:36,979
No, you...

752
02:07:38,526 --> 02:07:39,619
My hat.

753
02:07:58,566 --> 02:08:02,534
That hat belongs to the Lieutenant.

754
02:08:02,748 --> 02:08:07,527
He left it on the prairie. He didnt want it.

755
02:08:09,271 --> 02:08:12,371
Well, you can see he wants it now.

756
02:08:13,587 --> 02:08:17,430
We all know that it's a soldiers hat.

757
02:08:18,872 --> 02:08:21,437
We all know who wears it.

758
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:24,618
If you want to keep it, thats all right.

759
02:08:24,828 --> 02:08:26,959
But give something for it.

760
02:09:03,655 --> 02:09:04,855
Good trade.

761
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:19,104
There you are.

762
02:11:19,305 --> 02:11:20,825
Come here, Cisco.

763
02:12:17,899 --> 02:12:20,624
It seems every day ends with a miracle here.

764
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:23,923
And whatever God may be,
I thank God for this day.

765
02:12:25,198 --> 02:12:27,492
To stay any longer would have been useless.

766
02:12:27,665 --> 02:12:30,458
We had all the meat we could possibly carry.

767
02:12:30,864 --> 02:12:33,692
We had hunted for three days,
losing a half a dozen ponies...

768
02:12:33,864 --> 02:12:35,828
...and only three men injured.

769
02:12:36,497 --> 02:12:38,859
I'd never known a people so eager to laugh...

770
02:12:39,030 --> 02:12:42,085
...so devoted to family,
so dedicated to each other.

771
02:12:42,863 --> 02:12:45,828
And the only word
that came to mind was harmony.

772
02:12:55,062 --> 02:12:57,117
Many times I've felt alone...

773
02:12:57,328 --> 02:12:59,292
...but until this afternoon...

774
02:12:59,462 --> 02:13:01,982
...I'd never felt completely lonely.

775
02:15:59,925 --> 02:16:01,921
Made a long patrol today.

776
02:16:02,334 --> 02:16:04,330
Theres nothing to report.

777
02:16:04,645 --> 02:16:07,486
Time seems irrelevant
except for the fact that I am bored...

778
02:16:07,591 --> 02:16:09,964
...and these hours alone are endless.

779
02:16:30,024 --> 02:16:32,499
It is difficult for me to muster any enthusiasm...

780
02:16:32,570 --> 02:16:34,737
...for my regular duties here.

781
02:16:34,846 --> 02:16:37,344
And the fort is showing
serious signs of neglect.

782
02:16:40,236 --> 02:16:43,682
The truth is,
I am missing the company of my friends.

783
02:16:43,786 --> 02:16:47,392
I can see all of their faces,
but somehow it is not enough.

784
02:16:47,536 --> 02:16:49,567
Tomorrow I will pay them a visit.

785
02:16:49,679 --> 02:16:52,451
It may be forward of me, but what can it hurt?

786
02:16:52,861 --> 02:16:55,165
After all, they are my neighbors.

787
02:18:09,389 --> 02:18:13,153
The night sounds have become so familiar
as to be comforting.

788
02:18:13,358 --> 02:18:17,690
My life on the prairies a good one
and for the most part, I am content.

789
02:18:31,610 --> 02:18:35,409
The Indians have a great pull for me
that goes beyond curiosity.

790
02:18:35,514 --> 02:18:38,310
Theres something wise about them
and I'm drawn to them...

791
02:18:38,416 --> 02:18:41,907
...in ways much stronger
than my obligations to the military.

792
02:20:00,767 --> 02:20:01,993
Go home!

793
02:20:05,604 --> 02:20:06,864
Damn him.

794
02:20:27,159 --> 02:20:28,784
God! Go home!

795
02:20:34,534 --> 02:20:35,500
Go!

796
02:20:35,868 --> 02:20:37,561
Go home, Two Socks!

797
02:20:39,005 --> 02:20:40,402
Bad wolf!

798
02:21:20,814 --> 02:21:24,373
You were right. He is a special white man.

799
02:21:24,484 --> 02:21:26,746
He should have a real name.

800
02:21:43,602 --> 02:21:47,901
It is autumn now and I am spending
more time than ever with my friends.

801
02:21:47,974 --> 02:21:51,601
They have given me
my own lodge and I feel comfortable there.

802
02:21:51,710 --> 02:21:55,701
We talk every day,
but I know Kicking Bird is frustrated with me.

803
02:21:55,815 --> 02:21:59,249
He always wants to know
how many more white people are coming.

804
02:21:59,518 --> 02:22:04,180
I tell him they will most likely
pass through this country and nothing more.

805
02:22:04,390 --> 02:22:06,482
But I am speaking in half-truths.

806
02:22:06,659 --> 02:22:11,185
One day there will be too many,
but I cannot bring myself to tell him that.

807
02:22:11,331 --> 02:22:14,561
I am sure that Stands With A Fist
knows that I am holding back...

808
02:22:14,900 --> 02:22:17,366
...but to her credit, she says nothing.

809
02:22:46,266 --> 02:22:50,395
A war party is going against the Pawnee soon
and I have asked to go.

810
02:22:50,536 --> 02:22:52,696
I sense I made a mistake in doing so...

811
02:22:52,805 --> 02:22:55,637
...but I could not bring myself to take it back.

812
02:22:55,742 --> 02:22:58,402
They are my friends,
and from what little I gather...

813
02:22:58,510 --> 02:23:00,999
...the Pawnee have been
very hard on these people.

814
02:23:01,114 --> 02:23:03,774
I hope I have not overstepped my bounds.

815
02:23:08,220 --> 02:23:09,776
Come in, please.

816
02:23:12,293 --> 02:23:13,519
Sit down?

817
02:23:17,030 --> 02:23:19,088
Kicking Bird want to know...

818
02:23:19,198 --> 02:23:22,757
...why you want to make war on the Pawnee.

819
02:23:23,404 --> 02:23:26,099
They have done nothing to you.

820
02:23:26,806 --> 02:23:28,635
They are Sioux enemies.

821
02:23:36,215 --> 02:23:38,943
Only Sioux warriors to go.

822
02:23:39,953 --> 02:23:41,782
Tell him that I have been a warrior...

823
02:23:41,888 --> 02:23:45,186
...longer than many of the young men
who will go on this war party.

824
02:23:45,692 --> 02:23:46,918
Tell him.

825
02:24:01,541 --> 02:24:04,771
He said that the Sioux way of being a warrior...

826
02:24:04,878 --> 02:24:06,741
...is not the white way.

827
02:24:07,381 --> 02:24:11,372
- You are not ready.
- I know, I understand.

828
02:24:11,484 --> 02:24:14,007
Tell him I cannot learn these ways in camp.

829
02:24:21,462 --> 02:24:23,622
He also asks that you...

830
02:24:24,664 --> 02:24:28,064
...watch over his family while he is gone.

831
02:24:29,102 --> 02:24:32,831
This thing he asks is a great honor for you.

832
02:24:36,409 --> 02:24:40,276
Tell him that I would be happy
to watch over his family.

833
02:24:46,754 --> 02:24:49,482
He thanks Dances With Wolves for coming.

834
02:24:51,024 --> 02:24:52,990
Who is Dances With Wolves?

835
02:24:54,962 --> 02:24:58,453
It is the name which all the people...

836
02:24:58,565 --> 02:25:00,327
...are calling you now.

837
02:25:00,901 --> 02:25:02,366
Dances With...

838
02:25:03,870 --> 02:25:05,335
Thats right.

839
02:25:05,773 --> 02:25:07,033
That day.

840
02:25:08,307 --> 02:25:09,967
Dances With Wolves.

841
02:25:11,644 --> 02:25:13,269
How do you say it?

842
02:26:13,073 --> 02:26:18,532
Keep on with the white man talk if it pleases you.

843
02:26:18,645 --> 02:26:21,111
I like to make the talk.

844
02:27:01,722 --> 02:27:02,948
I'm here.

845
02:27:06,160 --> 02:27:07,524
We walk.

846
02:27:40,694 --> 02:27:42,183
I cut this off.

847
02:27:43,231 --> 02:27:45,460
I shaved it off. More.

848
02:27:47,668 --> 02:27:49,760
Grass grows on the prairie.

849
02:27:49,871 --> 02:27:51,336
Grass grows on the prairie?

850
02:27:53,607 --> 02:27:55,072
- Wrong.
- Wrong?

851
02:27:55,142 --> 02:27:57,267
You said, Fire lives on the prairie.

852
02:27:57,378 --> 02:27:58,571
I did?

853
02:27:59,279 --> 02:28:02,212
No laughing, though.

854
02:28:06,253 --> 02:28:09,049
That man is a fighter.

855
02:28:13,328 --> 02:28:14,521
Again.

856
02:28:15,329 --> 02:28:18,660
- That man is a fighter.
- Okay, I have it.

857
02:28:22,403 --> 02:28:23,460
Yes.

858
02:28:30,944 --> 02:28:32,637
Hoo hoo, right?

859
02:28:38,218 --> 02:28:39,184
No?

860
02:28:48,329 --> 02:28:49,624
Try this.

861
02:28:51,899 --> 02:28:53,559
What's the word...

862
02:28:54,135 --> 02:28:55,624
...for beautiful?

863
02:29:00,908 --> 02:29:03,137
What are you doing?

864
02:29:03,243 --> 02:29:06,972
It's hot, and we are sitting in the shade.

865
02:29:11,452 --> 02:29:13,418
I'm hungry.

866
02:29:31,204 --> 02:29:33,899
How is Dances With Wolves?

867
02:29:36,010 --> 02:29:38,135
What do you mean?

868
02:29:39,379 --> 02:29:41,868
How is he learning?

869
02:29:42,717 --> 02:29:46,412
He is a fast learner.

870
02:29:46,520 --> 02:29:49,352
What did you think I meant?

871
02:30:09,545 --> 02:30:11,637
You go for water, today?

872
02:30:16,451 --> 02:30:19,509
Then let us take you.

873
02:30:34,869 --> 02:30:36,858
How did you get your name?

874
02:30:41,209 --> 02:30:44,074
I was not very old...

875
02:30:45,079 --> 02:30:47,478
...when I came to be with the people.

876
02:30:48,384 --> 02:30:50,247
And I was made to work.

877
02:30:51,420 --> 02:30:53,512
I worked every day, very hard.

878
02:30:55,289 --> 02:30:58,620
There was a woman...

879
02:30:58,726 --> 02:31:00,692
...who didnt like me much.

880
02:31:02,297 --> 02:31:06,356
She used to call me bad names,
and sometimes she...

881
02:31:10,973 --> 02:31:12,199
Beat me?

882
02:31:16,210 --> 02:31:17,938
And one day, she was...

883
02:31:18,814 --> 02:31:20,974
...calling me these bad names...

884
02:31:21,416 --> 02:31:23,905
...with her face in my face...

885
02:31:24,920 --> 02:31:26,215
...and I hit her.

886
02:31:28,190 --> 02:31:31,282
I was not very big, but she fell down.

887
02:31:31,593 --> 02:31:33,753
She fell hard and didnt move.

888
02:31:35,197 --> 02:31:38,528
And then I stood over her with my fist...

889
02:31:38,801 --> 02:31:40,096
...and I asked if...

890
02:31:40,536 --> 02:31:42,798
...there was any other woman...

891
02:31:43,404 --> 02:31:45,666
...who wanted to call me bad names.

892
02:31:47,642 --> 02:31:50,006
No one bothered me after that day.

893
02:31:53,114 --> 02:31:56,082
No, I wouldnt think so.

894
02:32:01,189 --> 02:32:02,518
Show me.

895
02:32:03,625 --> 02:32:05,591
Show me where you hit her.

896
02:32:34,356 --> 02:32:36,254
Why are you not married?

897
02:32:40,361 --> 02:32:41,826
- I'm sorry.
- I have to go.

898
02:32:44,767 --> 02:32:46,062
I'm sorry.

899
02:32:48,270 --> 02:32:49,395
Can I help you?

900
02:33:19,768 --> 02:33:22,564
You are not talking today?

901
02:33:22,671 --> 02:33:24,364
No, I am not.

902
02:34:30,773 --> 02:34:36,869
Some of your words are wrong
but you are learning fast.

903
02:34:37,914 --> 02:34:42,213
So what can I tell you today?

904
02:34:43,485 --> 02:34:45,781
I want to know about Stands With A Fist.

905
02:34:45,888 --> 02:34:48,946
Why is there no man with her?

906
02:34:50,359 --> 02:34:53,019
She is in mourning.

907
02:34:55,631 --> 02:34:56,756
I don't...

908
02:34:58,101 --> 02:35:01,627
I do not understand mourning.

909
02:35:03,206 --> 02:35:05,570
She cries for someone.

910
02:35:07,843 --> 02:35:10,207
Cries for who?

911
02:35:14,017 --> 02:35:16,849
It is not polite to speak of the dead.

912
02:35:16,953 --> 02:35:20,910
But you are new, so I will tell you.

913
02:35:21,024 --> 02:35:23,253
She cries for her husband.

914
02:35:23,358 --> 02:35:25,450
He was killed not long ago.

915
02:35:25,561 --> 02:35:30,155
That is how you came to find her on the prairie.

916
02:35:33,569 --> 02:35:37,470
How long will she cry?

917
02:35:39,409 --> 02:35:44,310
It is Kicking Birds place
to say when she is finished.

918
02:35:44,681 --> 02:35:48,240
He's the one that found her
when she was very little.

919
02:36:06,002 --> 02:36:08,935
People are talking about you.

920
02:36:11,641 --> 02:36:13,665
What are they saying?

921
02:36:16,413 --> 02:36:18,573
They are proud of the medicine...

922
02:36:18,681 --> 02:36:22,137
...you are making with Dances With Wolves.

923
02:36:24,987 --> 02:36:29,251
I have hurt him, and I should go talk to him.

924
02:36:30,359 --> 02:36:33,054
You can't. He is gone.

925
02:36:33,931 --> 02:36:36,124
He left this morning.

926
02:39:01,343 --> 02:39:03,208
Bet you were thinking:

927
02:39:03,313 --> 02:39:05,304
Now, why don't he write?

928
02:39:06,185 --> 02:39:07,811
Hello, Two Socks.

929
02:39:35,333 --> 02:39:36,560
Come on.

930
02:39:41,210 --> 02:39:44,772
I won't hurt you. Come on. You can do this.

931
02:39:45,183 --> 02:39:46,774
You can do this.

932
02:39:51,192 --> 02:39:52,352
Come on.

933
02:40:04,515 --> 02:40:05,981
This is easy.

934
02:40:06,519 --> 02:40:08,384
This is easy, Two Socks.

935
02:41:29,927 --> 02:41:31,553
I am in mourning.

936
02:41:40,945 --> 02:41:42,411
No, we cannot.

937
02:41:42,714 --> 02:41:45,616
- Yes.
- We must be careful.

938
02:41:47,690 --> 02:41:49,088
We must be careful.

939
02:41:49,191 --> 02:41:50,657
Okay.

940
02:42:54,501 --> 02:42:55,559
Wait!

941
02:45:01,916 --> 02:45:02,974
What?

942
02:45:03,853 --> 02:45:05,047
Trouble.

943
02:45:28,728 --> 02:45:32,130
The Pawnee are coming.
A big party of 40 or 50 men this time.

944
02:45:32,234 --> 02:45:34,702
Hunters found them not far to the north.
Soon be here.

945
02:45:34,872 --> 02:45:38,866
Stone Calf, wait. I will follow you.

946
02:45:38,979 --> 02:45:41,846
The Pawnee do not come for horses.
They come for blood.

947
02:45:41,949 --> 02:45:43,883
Get your weapons and come to my lodge.

948
02:45:45,824 --> 02:45:47,018
I will get them.

949
02:45:47,793 --> 02:45:49,692
Stone Calf, wait.

950
02:45:49,796 --> 02:45:50,854
I have guns.

951
02:45:50,965 --> 02:45:53,433
I have many rifles.

952
02:45:55,606 --> 02:45:57,700
- At the fort?
- Yes.

953
02:45:58,444 --> 02:46:00,969
No. The ride is long and we can spare no men.

954
02:46:01,081 --> 02:46:04,175
Guns would make one warrior like two.

955
02:46:09,630 --> 02:46:12,828
Take one man and go quickly.

956
02:46:13,937 --> 02:46:16,428
I will take Smiles A Lot.

957
02:47:06,459 --> 02:47:07,425
Okay!

958
02:49:42,389 --> 02:49:43,879
Shoot the gun!

959
02:54:10,843 --> 02:54:12,974
It was hard to know how to feel.

960
02:54:13,085 --> 02:54:15,651
I'd never been in a battle like this one.

961
02:54:15,761 --> 02:54:18,395
There was no dark political objective.

962
02:54:18,505 --> 02:54:22,507
This was not a fight for territory or riches
or to make men free.

963
02:54:22,619 --> 02:54:26,497
It was fought to preserve the food stores
that would see us through the winter.

964
02:54:26,602 --> 02:54:31,016
To protect the lives of women and children
and loved ones only a few feet away.

965
02:54:31,318 --> 02:54:34,955
Stone Calf was a great loss,
but even the old men could not remember...

966
02:54:35,067 --> 02:54:37,005
...such a one-sided victory.

967
02:54:37,107 --> 02:54:40,049
And I gradually began
to look at it in a new way.

968
02:54:40,320 --> 02:54:42,816
I felt a pride I'd never felt before.

969
02:54:43,632 --> 02:54:46,436
I'd never really known who John Dunbar was.

970
02:54:46,810 --> 02:54:49,340
Perhaps the name itself had no meaning.

971
02:54:49,453 --> 02:54:52,588
But as I heard my Sioux name
being called over and over...

972
02:54:52,700 --> 02:54:55,539
...I knew for the first time who I really was.

973
02:56:18,755 --> 02:56:22,723
When we were younger,
he always bragged about how brave he was.

974
02:56:22,837 --> 02:56:26,303
And what a great chief he would make.

975
02:56:26,417 --> 02:56:28,686
He thought I was impressed.

976
02:56:28,792 --> 02:56:33,365
While walking on the prairie,
we surprised a small herd of buffalo.

977
02:56:33,476 --> 02:56:37,045
And the first thing this brave warrior did
is run for a tree.

978
02:56:39,767 --> 02:56:41,705
He would have forgotten all about me...

979
02:56:41,806 --> 02:56:43,904
...if he hadnt needed my help to climb it.

980
02:56:44,017 --> 02:56:48,623
And we sat there all day
as this old cow circled below.

981
02:56:48,733 --> 02:56:51,572
Making loud noises
and hitting her head against the trunk.

982
02:57:02,752 --> 02:57:06,595
Where are you going?
There is gambling tonight.

983
02:57:06,701 --> 02:57:09,174
Horsebacks games are always good.

984
02:57:10,548 --> 02:57:15,020
I'm tired.
Horseback already has a good rifle of mine.

985
02:57:18,578 --> 02:57:20,412
Good night.

986
02:58:03,714 --> 02:58:06,781
How long will Stands With A Fist mourn?

987
02:58:07,629 --> 02:58:09,532
I don't know.

988
02:58:13,283 --> 02:58:16,384
I hope it will not be too long.

989
02:58:19,005 --> 02:58:21,068
Has something happened?

990
02:58:21,714 --> 02:58:23,309
What?

991
02:58:24,190 --> 02:58:26,960
She has found love again.

992
02:58:28,038 --> 02:58:30,010
With who?

993
02:58:30,113 --> 02:58:31,582
Who do you think?

994
02:58:31,686 --> 02:58:32,949
Tell me.

995
02:58:33,058 --> 02:58:35,360
Dances With Wolves.

996
02:58:38,344 --> 02:58:40,316
Are you certain of this?

997
02:58:41,154 --> 02:58:44,894
When you see them together, you will know.

998
02:58:46,641 --> 02:58:48,636
What are people saying?

999
02:58:49,419 --> 02:58:51,449
They like the match.

1000
02:58:56,612 --> 02:58:58,710
No one is angry?

1001
02:58:58,821 --> 02:59:02,823
It makes sense. They are both white.

1002
02:59:04,876 --> 02:59:09,051
I suppose I will be the one to say something.

1003
02:59:09,996 --> 02:59:12,562
She's your daughter now.

1004
02:59:13,106 --> 02:59:15,044
I know.

1005
02:59:20,568 --> 02:59:24,446
Relax. You can't see everything coming.

1006
02:59:25,219 --> 02:59:28,526
Stop it. Quit your playing.

1007
02:59:42,316 --> 02:59:43,946
Stands With A Fist.

1008
02:59:45,261 --> 02:59:47,791
You will mourn no more.

1009
03:00:08,180 --> 03:00:10,746
Sit, sit.

1010
03:00:16,913 --> 03:00:19,912
Theres talk that you want to get married.

1011
03:00:22,232 --> 03:00:23,599
To who?

1012
03:00:24,373 --> 03:00:26,436
To Stands With A Fist.

1013
03:00:26,548 --> 03:00:28,451
Thats the one, isn't it?

1014
03:00:28,555 --> 03:00:29,752
She's in mourning.

1015
03:00:29,862 --> 03:00:31,331
Not today.

1016
03:00:31,400 --> 03:00:34,170
Kicking Bird has released her.

1017
03:00:34,277 --> 03:00:36,249
He did?

1018
03:00:36,653 --> 03:00:38,784
What are you doing here?

1019
03:00:40,100 --> 03:00:43,235
Kicking Bird told me to wait.

1020
03:00:45,051 --> 03:00:47,250
You might have to wait a long time.

1021
03:00:47,359 --> 03:00:51,429
Smiles A Lot says he saw Kicking Bird
riding on the prairie.

1022
03:00:52,948 --> 03:00:56,015
He says he was talking to himself.

1023
03:00:56,125 --> 03:00:57,618
A medicine man takes it pretty hard...

1024
03:00:57,732 --> 03:00:59,670
...when he is the last to know something.

1025
03:01:01,915 --> 03:01:04,114
What do I do?

1026
03:01:07,334 --> 03:01:11,509
You are pretty poor
and a Sioux girl is not for free.

1027
03:01:11,617 --> 03:01:14,113
I don't know if you can get married.

1028
03:01:18,912 --> 03:01:20,884
I have the buckskin...

1029
03:01:20,986 --> 03:01:22,479
No, thats too much medicine.

1030
03:01:24,968 --> 03:01:29,382
Do you think my horse is too much medicine?

1031
03:01:31,324 --> 03:01:33,820
For a girl.

1032
03:01:38,283 --> 03:01:42,126
Wait here. Maybe we can help you.

1033
03:01:42,265 --> 03:01:43,895
Wait.

1034
03:01:46,146 --> 03:01:48,084
Thats all I do is wait!

1035
03:02:08,966 --> 03:02:12,671
The whole village was eager
to take up a collection on my behalf.

1036
03:02:12,813 --> 03:02:15,755
The generosity of the people was astonishing.

1037
03:02:15,858 --> 03:02:19,199
The more valued the gift,
the more easily it was given.

1038
03:02:19,337 --> 03:02:23,647
Even the poorer families
wanted to give up animals they could not afford.

1039
03:02:23,820 --> 03:02:26,019
It was hard to turn them away.

1040
03:02:30,781 --> 03:02:32,776
Black Shawl was a mystery.

1041
03:02:33,556 --> 03:02:37,057
I couldnt guess what she was thinking
and she offered no advice...

1042
03:02:37,606 --> 03:02:39,601
...no words of encouragement.

1043
03:02:45,469 --> 03:02:47,771
I may have been the brunt of an inside joke...

1044
03:02:47,877 --> 03:02:50,179
...that included the entire village...

1045
03:02:50,354 --> 03:02:52,155
...but I was determined.

1046
03:02:55,539 --> 03:02:58,913
Wind In His Hair told me
if all the gifts were gone in the morning...

1047
03:02:59,019 --> 03:03:01,082
...my offer had been accepted.

1048
03:03:02,199 --> 03:03:06,407
I spent a sleepless night
wondering what misstep, if any, I had made.

1049
03:03:07,384 --> 03:03:10,657
I had no idea
what Kicking Birds decision would be.

1050
03:03:34,837 --> 03:03:36,255
Turn around.

1051
03:03:38,268 --> 03:03:40,520
You look good.

1052
03:03:40,618 --> 03:03:43,498
You know, the man she mourned for...

1053
03:03:43,606 --> 03:03:46,237
He was my best friend.

1054
03:03:47,991 --> 03:03:49,951
I didnt know that.

1055
03:03:52,375 --> 03:03:54,335
He was a good man.

1056
03:03:54,981 --> 03:03:57,959
It has been hard for me to like you.

1057
03:03:59,366 --> 03:04:02,604
I am not the thinker Kicking Bird is.

1058
03:04:02,702 --> 03:04:04,987
I always feel anger first.

1059
03:04:05,086 --> 03:04:07,588
There were no answers to my questions.

1060
03:04:07,691 --> 03:04:12,608
But now I think he went away
because you were coming.

1061
03:04:12,712 --> 03:04:14,867
That is how I see it.

1062
03:04:39,734 --> 03:04:42,332
This is a good day for me.

1063
03:04:44,254 --> 03:04:45,569
And for me.

1064
03:04:49,072 --> 03:04:52,727
If you want this man, take his hand in yours.

1065
03:05:07,387 --> 03:05:09,422
I had never been married before.

1066
03:05:09,532 --> 03:05:12,400
I don't know if all grooms
have the same experience...

1067
03:05:12,502 --> 03:05:16,787
...but as Kicking Bird began to speak about
what was expected of a Sioux husband...

1068
03:05:16,891 --> 03:05:20,580
...my mind began to swim
in a way that shut out everything but her...

1069
03:05:20,686 --> 03:05:22,924
...the tiny details of her costume...

1070
03:05:23,029 --> 03:05:25,031
...the contours of her shape...

1071
03:05:25,338 --> 03:05:27,182
...the light in her eyes...

1072
03:05:27,384 --> 03:05:29,386
...the smallness of her feet.

1073
03:05:30,124 --> 03:05:32,890
I knew that the love
between us would be served.

1074
03:05:38,704 --> 03:05:41,933
Have you heard all that I have said?

1075
03:05:44,248 --> 03:05:45,226
Yes.

1076
03:05:47,054 --> 03:05:50,709
Good, then take her inside.

1077
03:05:50,815 --> 03:05:52,490
She is your wife.

1078
03:05:55,569 --> 03:05:57,043
Good.

1079
03:05:58,848 --> 03:06:01,206
Thank you.

1080
03:06:07,520 --> 03:06:08,656
Bye.

1081
03:06:14,707 --> 03:06:15,843
Bye.

1082
03:06:59,697 --> 03:07:03,256
Dances With Wolves door
is closed a lot these days.

1083
03:07:03,365 --> 03:07:07,264
I think they're having trouble making a baby.

1084
03:07:07,366 --> 03:07:10,663
I don't think they're having trouble at all.

1085
03:07:14,670 --> 03:07:18,069
If we pull the smoke flap shut,
they will come out for sure.

1086
03:07:43,150 --> 03:07:46,981
Dances With Wolves, are you in there?

1087
03:07:49,653 --> 03:07:53,780
Today I am riding away to a far away place.

1088
03:07:53,889 --> 03:07:56,014
I would like you to ride with me.

1089
03:08:11,763 --> 03:08:13,922
It's good to be out.

1090
03:08:14,965 --> 03:08:17,295
Yes, it must be.

1091
03:08:18,500 --> 03:08:20,864
We are trying for a baby.

1092
03:08:22,268 --> 03:08:23,962
No waiting?

1093
03:08:24,569 --> 03:08:26,263
No waiting.

1094
03:08:30,572 --> 03:08:34,972
I was just thinking
that of all the trails in this life...

1095
03:08:36,175 --> 03:08:38,971
...there is one that matters most.

1096
03:08:39,076 --> 03:08:42,339
It is the trail of a true human being.

1097
03:08:43,645 --> 03:08:48,079
I think you are on this trail, and it is good to see.

1098
03:09:08,056 --> 03:09:10,522
We call you the Busy Bee.

1099
03:09:46,541 --> 03:09:50,372
It is said that all the animals were born here.

1100
03:09:50,476 --> 03:09:54,637
That from here they spread over the prairies
to feed all the people.

1101
03:09:55,312 --> 03:09:58,837
Even our enemies agree
that this is a sacred place.

1102
03:10:49,970 --> 03:10:51,698
It's quiet here.

1103
03:12:51,693 --> 03:12:54,251
We must wait for these people.

1104
03:12:55,595 --> 03:12:59,324
No, they've been gone a week. Maybe more.

1105
03:13:01,999 --> 03:13:05,262
We will water the horses and go home.

1106
03:13:51,588 --> 03:13:55,351
You always ask about the white people.

1107
03:13:57,157 --> 03:13:59,316
You always want to know
how many more are coming.

1108
03:14:01,693 --> 03:14:04,319
There will be a lot, my friend.

1109
03:14:04,427 --> 03:14:06,155
More than can be counted.

1110
03:14:08,729 --> 03:14:09,956
How many?

1111
03:14:12,665 --> 03:14:14,154
Like the stars.

1112
03:14:28,506 --> 03:14:32,462
It makes me afraid for all the Sioux.

1113
03:14:39,878 --> 03:14:42,640
We should tell this to Ten Bears.

1114
03:15:09,124 --> 03:15:11,147
The men who wore this came...

1115
03:15:11,259 --> 03:15:14,090
...in the time of my grandfathers grandfather.

1116
03:15:14,727 --> 03:15:17,387
Eventually we drove them out.

1117
03:15:18,162 --> 03:15:21,857
Then the Mexicans came.
They do not come here anymore.

1118
03:15:22,297 --> 03:15:25,287
In my own time, the Texans.

1119
03:15:25,398 --> 03:15:27,887
They have been like all the others.

1120
03:15:30,967 --> 03:15:35,628
They take without asking.

1121
03:15:36,637 --> 03:15:40,400
I don't know if we are ready for these people.

1122
03:15:41,872 --> 03:15:46,397
But I think you are right.
I think they will keep coming.

1123
03:15:47,675 --> 03:15:50,141
When I think of that, I look at this helmet.

1124
03:15:52,678 --> 03:15:56,771
Our country is all that we have,
and we will fight to keep it.

1125
03:15:57,880 --> 03:15:59,903
Tomorrow we will strike the village...

1126
03:16:00,015 --> 03:16:02,345
...and go to the winter camp.

1127
03:16:33,530 --> 03:16:36,292
You have everything from the soldier fort?

1128
03:16:36,565 --> 03:16:37,588
Yes.

1129
03:16:37,965 --> 03:16:40,056
Theres nothing for me there.

1130
03:16:41,034 --> 03:16:42,432
Thats good.

1131
03:16:56,041 --> 03:16:57,405
The journal.

1132
03:16:59,676 --> 03:17:01,336
Stands With... Wait!

1133
03:17:01,744 --> 03:17:02,903
Words are important!

1134
03:17:03,010 --> 03:17:05,340
The words in the book
are like a trail for people to follow.

1135
03:17:05,445 --> 03:17:09,208
Now, it tells everything about my life here.
I must get it.

1136
03:17:09,447 --> 03:17:10,572
Enough.

1137
03:17:10,681 --> 03:17:13,239
We cannot wait for you.

1138
03:17:25,154 --> 03:17:27,313
I'll catch up.

1139
03:18:08,941 --> 03:18:10,066
Injun!

1140
03:18:10,509 --> 03:18:11,975
Get him! Injun!

1141
03:18:17,645 --> 03:18:18,611
No!

1142
03:18:40,222 --> 03:18:42,415
Stay down. Stay.

1143
03:18:42,824 --> 03:18:44,188
My God.

1144
03:18:44,892 --> 03:18:46,119
God.

1145
03:18:51,795 --> 03:18:53,022
It's okay.

1146
03:19:35,348 --> 03:19:36,837
Something has happened.

1147
03:19:36,949 --> 03:19:39,507
Dances With Wolves is not coming.

1148
03:19:40,184 --> 03:19:42,150
He must have trouble.

1149
03:19:43,819 --> 03:19:49,152
Pick two good men
and send them back to the soldier fort.

1150
03:20:00,960 --> 03:20:02,324
Spivey.

1151
03:20:03,228 --> 03:20:05,387
- Spivey!
- Yeah, Sergeant.

1152
03:20:06,529 --> 03:20:08,688
Tell the major he's waking up.

1153
03:20:10,631 --> 03:20:12,529
Move your worthless ass.

1154
03:20:24,104 --> 03:20:26,093
You got yourself a hell of a shiner...

1155
03:20:26,939 --> 03:20:28,200
...didnt you?

1156
03:20:28,306 --> 03:20:30,363
Majors coming through.

1157
03:20:40,478 --> 03:20:42,342
Does he speak English?

1158
03:20:42,513 --> 03:20:44,139
I don't know, sir.

1159
03:20:45,948 --> 03:20:47,710
Speak English?

1160
03:20:49,549 --> 03:20:52,072
Talk English? Talk!

1161
03:20:53,885 --> 03:20:55,476
I speak English.

1162
03:21:00,020 --> 03:21:01,384
Who are you?

1163
03:21:03,589 --> 03:21:07,750
Lt. John J. Dunbar. This is my post.

1164
03:21:08,358 --> 03:21:10,052
Why are you dressed like this?

1165
03:21:12,327 --> 03:21:16,158
I came out from Fort Hayes last April,
but there was nobody here.

1166
03:21:16,761 --> 03:21:18,727
Do you have proof of that?

1167
03:21:21,297 --> 03:21:25,560
My journals on the bunk in my quarters.
My orders are in the journal.

1168
03:21:25,666 --> 03:21:27,757
It will tell you everything.

1169
03:21:28,100 --> 03:21:30,692
Spivey, you and Edwards
were the first ones here.

1170
03:21:30,802 --> 03:21:33,098
Did you find anything? A journal?

1171
03:21:33,469 --> 03:21:35,765
No, we didnt find nothing, sir.

1172
03:21:36,204 --> 03:21:37,761
Wheres Edwards?

1173
03:21:38,305 --> 03:21:39,771
He's outside.

1174
03:21:44,375 --> 03:21:46,773
He didnt find nothing either.

1175
03:21:51,011 --> 03:21:53,307
Somebody find me Edwards.

1176
03:22:02,116 --> 03:22:03,776
You turned Injun, didnt you?

1177
03:22:08,920 --> 03:22:10,250
Didnt you?

1178
03:22:14,955 --> 03:22:17,148
What did you say your name was?

1179
03:22:17,891 --> 03:22:19,050
Dunbar.

1180
03:22:20,158 --> 03:22:22,556
D-u-n-b-a-r. John.

1181
03:22:22,659 --> 03:22:24,625
You say youre an officer?

1182
03:22:24,927 --> 03:22:28,724
- God. Did you read my orders?
- No.

1183
03:22:29,396 --> 03:22:31,453
They're in my journal.

1184
03:22:31,730 --> 03:22:33,424
There are no orders.

1185
03:22:33,931 --> 03:22:35,625
Theres no journal.

1186
03:22:40,101 --> 03:22:42,090
Why are you out of uniform?

1187
03:22:44,503 --> 03:22:46,231
I have to relieve myself.

1188
03:22:49,472 --> 03:22:52,166
- Sergeant, take care of him.
- Yes, sir.

1189
03:22:53,841 --> 03:22:55,000
Lets go.

1190
03:22:59,043 --> 03:23:01,168
- He's a white man.
- Doesnt look white to me.

1191
03:23:02,011 --> 03:23:04,978
- They say he's a soldier.
- He's an officer.

1192
03:23:05,079 --> 03:23:06,909
Do you salute him or shoot him?

1193
03:23:15,918 --> 03:23:17,782
Here, you. Eyes front.

1194
03:23:23,688 --> 03:23:25,279
I said eyes front!

1195
03:23:27,356 --> 03:23:29,822
Don't shoot him! Hit him! Get him!

1196
03:23:29,890 --> 03:23:31,151
Get him!

1197
03:24:21,615 --> 03:24:23,604
Why are you out of uniform?

1198
03:24:27,617 --> 03:24:29,106
What's the army doing out here?

1199
03:24:30,185 --> 03:24:32,708
- Lieutenants asking the questions.
- Bauer.

1200
03:24:39,022 --> 03:24:41,318
Were charged with apprehending...

1201
03:24:44,259 --> 03:24:47,715
Were charged with apprehending hostiles
and recovering stolen property...

1202
03:24:47,827 --> 03:24:50,589
...retrieving white captives
taken in hostile raidings.

1203
03:24:50,695 --> 03:24:54,628
- There are no hostiles.
- We will ascertain that for ourselves.

1204
03:24:54,730 --> 03:24:57,720
If youll guide us to these camps
and serve as an interpreter...

1205
03:24:57,831 --> 03:25:00,195
...your conduct will be re-evaluated.

1206
03:25:00,733 --> 03:25:02,722
- What conduct?
- With all due respect...

1207
03:25:02,834 --> 03:25:06,097
Your status as a traitor might improve
should you choose...

1208
03:25:06,202 --> 03:25:08,896
...to cooperate with the United States Army.

1209
03:25:10,737 --> 03:25:13,033
Theres nothing for you to do out here.

1210
03:25:16,707 --> 03:25:19,173
Are you willing to cooperate or not?

1211
03:25:21,942 --> 03:25:23,431
Speak up!

1212
03:25:27,245 --> 03:25:30,576
I am Dances With Wolves.

1213
03:25:32,781 --> 03:25:33,644
What's that?

1214
03:25:36,516 --> 03:25:39,142
I have nothing to say to you.

1215
03:25:39,250 --> 03:25:42,445
You are not worth talking to.

1216
03:25:52,457 --> 03:25:56,118
Sergeant, form a detail
and take this man down to the river.

1217
03:25:57,026 --> 03:25:59,822
- Let him clean up his face.
- Yes, sir.

1218
03:26:01,928 --> 03:26:03,417
Not you, Spivey.

1219
03:26:31,475 --> 03:26:32,805
Lieutenant.

1220
03:26:35,410 --> 03:26:37,308
Major wants to see you.

1221
03:27:11,627 --> 03:27:12,991
Spivey.

1222
03:27:18,063 --> 03:27:20,052
Spivey. You got paper?

1223
03:27:20,698 --> 03:27:24,154
- What's it to you?
- Give me some, shit-bird.

1224
03:27:24,533 --> 03:27:25,556
Can you read?

1225
03:27:25,767 --> 03:27:27,926
No, I can't read. What the hells the difference?

1226
03:27:28,035 --> 03:27:30,968
You can't read either. Now just give me some.

1227
03:27:31,503 --> 03:27:35,334
- Quick, give me some!
- All right. Hold your horses.

1228
03:28:57,443 --> 03:28:58,568
Bauer!

1229
03:29:02,212 --> 03:29:03,473
Let go of me!

1230
03:29:11,783 --> 03:29:14,614
Lap it up, Injun. Go ahead. Lap it up.

1231
03:29:17,386 --> 03:29:19,114
You son of a bitch!

1232
03:29:22,054 --> 03:29:23,543
It's all right.

1233
03:29:24,289 --> 03:29:25,778
It's all right.

1234
03:29:26,390 --> 03:29:30,517
He's going to get hungrier, thats all.
But maybe that don't matter.

1235
03:29:31,358 --> 03:29:34,325
Word is they're going to ship you back to Hayes.

1236
03:29:34,426 --> 03:29:37,086
And once you get there, they gonna hang you.

1237
03:29:40,763 --> 03:29:43,753
Come on. Forget about him.
Go on. Get out of here.

1238
03:29:58,871 --> 03:29:59,996
Get up in there!

1239
03:30:26,017 --> 03:30:27,983
Spivey, what is that?

1240
03:30:28,419 --> 03:30:30,544
Looks like he's following us.

1241
03:30:30,853 --> 03:30:32,547
Hell, I'm going to shoot him.

1242
03:30:33,721 --> 03:30:34,846
Dang. You missed him.

1243
03:30:35,922 --> 03:30:38,821
- Don't shoot, damn it. It's my shot.
- Wait. I seen him first.

1244
03:30:38,923 --> 03:30:40,753
- Get down!
- Look at that stupid bastard.

1245
03:30:40,858 --> 03:30:42,586
He ain't even moving.

1246
03:30:43,159 --> 03:30:46,752
- Wait a minute! Thats my shot.
- Shoot him!

1247
03:30:47,861 --> 03:30:50,327
Shoot him, Edwards. He's standing there.

1248
03:30:50,762 --> 03:30:51,625
Shoot him!

1249
03:30:54,964 --> 03:30:57,021
Jesus Christ! Holy shit!

1250
03:31:01,634 --> 03:31:03,464
Bauer, get him off him!

1251
03:31:10,271 --> 03:31:11,794
He might have killed you.

1252
03:31:19,675 --> 03:31:21,141
I'll get that son of a bitch.

1253
03:31:27,746 --> 03:31:29,372
Sit down, goddamn it!

1254
03:31:41,752 --> 03:31:43,309
Thats it. I got him!

1255
03:31:46,822 --> 03:31:48,913
Dead shot, boys. Come on.

1256
03:31:50,390 --> 03:31:51,879
Son of a bitch!

1257
03:31:52,525 --> 03:31:53,684
Get up!

1258
03:31:55,392 --> 03:31:56,415
Get up!

1259
03:31:57,994 --> 03:31:59,790
I mean it! Get up!

1260
03:31:59,895 --> 03:32:01,861
Get up! Come on, get up!

1261
03:32:02,428 --> 03:32:03,451
What?

1262
03:32:03,563 --> 03:32:06,792
You bash that prisoner one more time,
I'll put those shackles on you.

1263
03:32:07,864 --> 03:32:09,989
You men get back here!

1264
03:32:13,634 --> 03:32:14,998
Goddamn it!

1265
03:32:53,653 --> 03:32:54,550
Boo.

1266
03:33:03,124 --> 03:33:05,386
Clear behind that stand of trees?

1267
03:33:09,626 --> 03:33:11,354
All right. Lets go.

1268
03:33:34,872 --> 03:33:36,168
I don't see nobody.

1269
03:33:54,881 --> 03:33:56,074
Indians!

1270
03:37:38,619 --> 03:37:39,585
No.

1271
03:40:28,097 --> 03:40:32,724
Dances With Wolves is quiet these days.

1272
03:40:34,501 --> 03:40:36,990
Is his heart bad?

1273
03:40:46,105 --> 03:40:49,266
Killing the soldiers at the river...

1274
03:40:51,741 --> 03:40:53,934
...was a good thing.

1275
03:40:54,843 --> 03:40:57,742
I did not mind killing those men.
I was glad to do it.

1276
03:41:01,780 --> 03:41:07,476
But the soldiers hate me now,
like they hate no other.

1277
03:41:08,649 --> 03:41:11,912
They think I am a traitor.

1278
03:41:16,620 --> 03:41:19,985
And they will hunt for me.

1279
03:41:20,088 --> 03:41:24,283
And when they find me, they find you.

1280
03:41:25,791 --> 03:41:31,623
I think it would be wise to move the village now.

1281
03:41:38,630 --> 03:41:40,823
I will be leaving.

1282
03:41:43,266 --> 03:41:47,256
I must go and talk with those who would listen.

1283
03:41:56,105 --> 03:41:58,970
Quiet. You are hurting my ears.

1284
03:42:08,944 --> 03:42:11,604
Leave us alone.

1285
03:42:29,420 --> 03:42:33,444
You are the only white man I have ever known.

1286
03:42:33,556 --> 03:42:37,489
I have thought about you a lot.
More than you know.

1287
03:42:37,591 --> 03:42:41,354
But I think you are wrong.

1288
03:42:42,293 --> 03:42:45,351
The man the soldiers are looking for
no longer exists.

1289
03:42:45,462 --> 03:42:51,886
Now there is only a Sioux
named Dances With Wolves.

1290
03:42:55,799 --> 03:42:58,027
Lets smoke awhile.

1291
03:43:03,703 --> 03:43:06,499
With Ten Bears,
it was always more than a while.

1292
03:43:06,604 --> 03:43:10,367
There was purpose in everything he did
and I knew he wanted me to stay.

1293
03:43:10,473 --> 03:43:12,133
But I was sure of myself.

1294
03:43:12,240 --> 03:43:16,367
I would be an excuse and thats all
the army would need to find this place.

1295
03:43:16,476 --> 03:43:19,136
I pushed him as far as I could
to move the camp...

1296
03:43:19,244 --> 03:43:22,609
...but in the end he only smiled
and talked of simple pleasures.

1297
03:43:22,712 --> 03:43:26,941
He reminded me that at his age
a good fire is better than anything.

1298
03:43:27,380 --> 03:43:29,778
Ten Bears was an extraordinary man.

1299
03:44:11,101 --> 03:44:12,965
You have nothing to say?

1300
03:44:15,370 --> 03:44:17,098
What can I tell you?

1301
03:44:18,805 --> 03:44:20,737
What's ever on your mind.

1302
03:44:27,408 --> 03:44:29,374
Youve made the decision.

1303
03:44:33,845 --> 03:44:35,607
My place is with you.

1304
03:44:36,613 --> 03:44:38,239
I go where you go.

1305
03:44:41,815 --> 03:44:43,441
Youre not afraid?

1306
03:44:44,583 --> 03:44:45,571
No.

1307
03:44:49,086 --> 03:44:52,144
I told Ten Bears
we'd leave when the snow breaks.

1308
03:44:59,290 --> 03:45:01,120
Did you tell everyone?

1309
03:45:05,193 --> 03:45:06,659
Not everyone.

1310
03:45:43,177 --> 03:45:45,405
It's all right.

1311
03:46:18,327 --> 03:46:19,657
You...

1312
03:46:20,762 --> 03:46:22,251
...finish your pipe?

1313
03:46:35,402 --> 03:46:36,698
Good pipe.

1314
03:46:38,202 --> 03:46:39,532
How...

1315
03:46:40,070 --> 03:46:41,434
...does it smoke?

1316
03:46:44,606 --> 03:46:46,095
I've never smoked it.

1317
03:46:57,946 --> 03:46:59,276
We come far...

1318
03:46:59,713 --> 03:47:01,043
...you and me.

1319
03:47:03,782 --> 03:47:05,612
I will not forget you.

1320
03:48:54,133 --> 03:48:56,725
Dances With Wolves.

1321
03:48:57,901 --> 03:49:00,527
I am Wind In His Hair.

1322
03:49:00,636 --> 03:49:04,126
Do you see that I am your friend?

1323
03:49:08,172 --> 03:49:11,367
Can you see that you will always be my friend?

1324
03:50:39,049 --> 03:50:40,981
Sergeant! Over here! Now!
