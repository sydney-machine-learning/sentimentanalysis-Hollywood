1
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,039
Excuse me.

2
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,287
Shithead.

3
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,319
You shouldn't be here.

4
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,799
I know. Ask for at
least $1,000, okay?

5
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,799
I'll get as much
as I can. You hide.

6
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,759
His wife took his kid
and a couple of million,

7
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,759
and we won't get a thousand.

8
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,279
Shut up and stay hidden.

9
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,006
I told him I was coming alone.

10
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,879
Hey, Mr. Crisp.

11
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,519
How's it going?

12
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,519
You said you had information
about my family.

13
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,768
Yeah, yeah, I do.

14
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,361
Well, let's have it.

15
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,039
Well, it's going to cost you.

16
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,719
Like $1,000?

17
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,519
Okay, that's obviously
not my final offer.

18
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,245
750 would be fine.

19
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,199
I mean, more than fine.

20
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,483
Just tell me what you have, Danny,
and I'll take good care of you.

21
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,159
Okay.

22
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,771
That sounds fair.

23
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,928
I was doing a delivery for Corky last week
out of state, and I ran into your ex.

24
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,640
How'd she look?

25
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,084
She looked great, Mr. Crisp. Yeah.

26
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,206
She changed her hair and stuff, but
she looked like a million dollars.

27
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,766
In fact, she looked
like about $3 million.

28
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,045
Did she see you?

29
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,080
No. I was changing a tire,

30
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,363
and suddenly, there she was across the
street, taking her kid into this school.

31
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,599
My boy?

32
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,759
Looked great.

33
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,530
He looked very healthy.

34
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,479
It's a real nice, healthy
place where they're living.

35
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,364
It snows in winter there.

36
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,930
Danny,

37
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,451
where are they?

38
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,130
At the school where I saw them...

39
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,331
Astoria Elementary School.

40
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,079
That's...

41
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,965
It's in Astoria, Oregon.

42
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,087
All right.

43
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,399
Did you tell anyone else this?

44
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,204
No. No way.

45
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,962
Hey, I'm not stupid, Mr. Crisp.

46
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,599
You're not?

47
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,845
Danny.

48
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,083
Danny! No!

49
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,085
Danny!

50
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,079
Danny!

51
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,327
Get up!

52
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,524
Don't you die on me!

53
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,879
I didn't kill him.
I didn't kill him.

54
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,039
Was it Crisp?

55
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,799
I don't know.
I didn't see anything.

56
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,519
I was in a box over there...

57
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,719
What are you doing?

58
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,479
Hey, hey, hey!

59
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,719
Stop it! Don't do that!

60
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,999
Don't go anywhere.

61
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,359
Let me go!

62
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,799
No! Let me off of him!

63
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,839
I don't like what you've done.
I really don't like it.

64
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,519
It feels terrible, and
it looks dreadful.

65
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,919
I'm trying my best.

66
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,479
Maybe your best isn't good enough.

67
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,799
I'm back.

68
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,519
Oh, great. Well, that was fast.

69
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,324
It was easy.

70
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,319
I have some great, exciting,
wonderful news, Mother.

71
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,679
Oh, you always exaggerate, Cullen.

72
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,959
Everything is always
great, terrific.

73
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,919
So, what's so great?

74
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,199
I just found out where
they're hiding.

75
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,210
Are you serious?
You really know where he is?

76
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,370
Manicure, Mr. Crisp?

77
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,399
Oh, how could I say no to you?

78
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,639
Tell me.

79
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,080
What's happened?

80
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,679
Just let me handle
this myself, Mother.

81
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,439
I know what I'm doing.

82
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,244
Everything is under control.

83
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,679
It's all right. I'm
a police officer.

84
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,479
Crisp, you're under arrest.

85
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,079
Put your hands on
your head and get up!

86
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,519
Kimble, not again!

87
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,719
Your hands!

88
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,639
They're up. When will
you leave me alone?

89
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,479
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

90
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,331
Hey, I'm a police officer.
This is an arrest.

91
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,479
This man's crazy. Look at him.

92
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,839
He'll kill me. You're just
going to stand there?

93
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,087
Freeze!

94
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,241
I'm a cop!

95
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,039
I'm Detective John Kimble.
This man is under arrest.

96
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,844
I'm checking.

97
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,239
You can't just walk in here
and put a gun in my face.

98
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,408
I'm trying to get a manicure.

99
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,650
I have witnesses.

100
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,685
I have a witness, too.

101
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,482
It's murder one this time.

102
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,400
Now you're mine.

103
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,848
The bastard handcuffed
me to a dead man!

104
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,399
A dead man!

105
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,045
Come on. Sit down.

106
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,079
Now, did Danny ever say what
Crisp's wife looked like?

107
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,279
No.

108
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,839
Did he ever say what name
she was using in Oregon?

109
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,639
He didn't say anything.

110
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,399
Look, I just want to go home.

111
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,359
After the lineup, I'll drive you
home. I'll even buy you dinner.

112
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,599
I'll even cook you dinner.

113
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,488
I'm not doing any lineup, and there
ain't jack shit you can do about it!

114
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,359
I've been after Crisp for four years, and
she's letting my key witness walk away?

115
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,039
Kimble, sit down!

116
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,119
Sit down.

117
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,481
- Sit.
- Sit.

118
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,119
Now listen to me. He
killed your boyfriend.

119
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,719
All you have to do is point your finger,
and we can put him away for 30 years.

120
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,685
He wasn't my boyfriend.
I hardly knew the guy.

121
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,605
I know you're in there.

122
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,119
I know what you want,
but you ain't getting it.

123
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,079
No lineup, no testimony.

124
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,839
So shove your handcuffs
up your ass!

125
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,371
Now let me out of here!

126
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,371
Slow down!

127
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,251
Open it and let me out!

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,248
O'Hara, meet Kimble.

129
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,679
Kimble's been on this a long time.

130
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,799
Hi.

131
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,039
Let me take care of Cindy.

132
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,765
She'll make Crisp. I guarantee it.

133
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,524
What are you going to do, handcuff her
to your car and take her for a ride?

134
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,047
I'm not going to offer
to cook her dinner.

135
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,762
Kimble, hold on a second. I...

136
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,439
Difficult man. Got
to get to know him.

137
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,971
Oh, I can't wait.

138
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,479
Aah!

139
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,806
Hey, baby.

140
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,330
What you mean, "Hey, baby?"

141
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,081
Shit!

142
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,399
Oh, excuse me.

143
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,523
I forgot to introduce myself.

144
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,679
My name is John Kimble,

145
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,799
And I love my car.

146
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,968
I'll keep an eye on it for you.

147
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,330
You got a beautiful ride.

148
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,399
Shit. Who does he think he is?
He's lucky I didn't kick his ass.

149
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,839
Open up.

150
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,485
You can't come in.

151
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,407
Thank you.

152
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,245
What the fuck?

153
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,129
All right, party's over.
Everyone go home.

154
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,690
Next time, my place.

155
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,486
So who are you, man?

156
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,161
Shit!

157
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,726
I'm the party-pooper.

158
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,966
Hi, Cindy.

159
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,484
Do you mind if I sit down?

160
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,208
No. Sit down, man.

161
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,239
Oh, it's so nice to see you again.

162
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,920
What are you doing
here, you asshole?

163
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,800
Cindy, I don't like you
using foul language,

164
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,004
not a classy girl like you.

165
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,962
Don't you have
anything better to do?

166
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,890
You don't understand.

167
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,445
I have nothing else to do, and
I have nowhere else to go.

168
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,679
Why are you staring
at me like that?

169
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,639
I like you, Cindy.

170
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,639
I'm going to be around you a lot.

171
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,079
Days, nights, weekends, holidays.

172
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,959
No. No, you can't.

173
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,359
Yes, I can.

174
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,319
I'm going to hang out with you

175
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,648
until the end of time.

176
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,410
All right, move it in. Let's go.

177
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,610
Step onto the numbers.

178
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,241
Face front.

179
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,169
Everybody, hands to your side.

180
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,371
That's the creep.

181
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,919
Who?

182
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,521
Number five. That's him.

183
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,771
Good. Very good.

184
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,879
Mr. Crisp, you will be remanded
into custody until your trial.

185
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,889
Bailiff, remove the prisoner.

186
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Shh. Don't say anything. Just take it
easy. I'll take care of it. Trust me.

187
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,719
You know what to do?

188
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,002
I'm your mother, aren't I?

189
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,479
Mind if I talk to my
friend a little bit?

190
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,967
I'm not talking to anybody
without my lawyer.

191
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,726
He's right in here.

192
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,719
You give me the names of your
drug suppliers and distributors,

193
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,606
and I'll tell the judge what a
nice, cooperative killer you are.

194
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,719
You think the jury's
going to convict me

195
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,604
on the testimony of that junkie?

196
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,964
You could be right.

197
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,079
But what about your wife?

198
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,089
You remember her?

199
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,849
All that hard-earned drug
money she stole from you?

200
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,484
How much was it, $3 million?

201
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,041
I bet she would make a
much better witness.

202
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,639
Kimble, you've wasted
years chasing after me,

203
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,199
and what has it gotten you, hmm?

204
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,319
Nothing.

205
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,639
I'll be out in a week,

206
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,684
and you'll still be eating take-out
food in that dump you live in.

207
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,279
Yeah, I know all about you, Kimble.

208
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,324
Without me, you wouldn't
even have a life.

209
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,439
My old lady left
'cause of the money.

210
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,361
Yours left because she just
couldn't stand the sight of you.

211
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,519
I've never seen anyone
so little eat so much.

212
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,239
Yeah, I know. I'm hypoglycemic.

213
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,488
If I don't eat regularly,
I get a little nuts.

214
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,719
So, where you from?

215
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,319
Austria.

216
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,249
How long you been a cop?

217
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,279
I been a cop for 12 years.

218
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,799
My father was a cop,
my brother was a cop,

219
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,199
my mother was a cop's wife.

220
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,399
And I have no hobbies.

221
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,599
Good news.

222
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,639
You two are booked on the first
flight to Portland tomorrow.

223
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,559
Locate Crisp's wife and
offer her immunity

224
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,683
in exchange for her
testimony against him.

225
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,087
No offense to O'Hallahan,

226
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,759
but this is my case,
and I work alone.

227
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,639
He works alone. Not anymore.

228
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,128
She's going in undercover as a
substitute kindergarten teacher.

229
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,479
Not exactly a job for you.

230
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,599
I used to be a teacher.

231
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,839
We'll be fine.

232
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,199
What do I do?

233
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,679
She locates the kid, you find
the mother and the cash,

234
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,439
and Crisp spends his life
making license plates.

235
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,085
Bon voyage.

236
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,803
Oh, and Kimble, the name's O'Hara.

237
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,279
Okay. Here's the wife at 17.
Real name's Rachel Myatt.

238
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,639
She's from Hannibal,
Missouri, class of '76.

239
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,319
Cheerleader, first violin
in the school orchestra,

240
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,519
captain of the girls'
softball team.

241
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,719
Her ambition was "To travel,

242
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,599
"experience life, and
meet interesting people."

243
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,450
Like Crisp.

244
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,531
Okay.

245
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,319
Relax.

246
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,488
Don't let him get to you.

247
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,359
That's her 10 years later.

248
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,239
It's a great shot of an ear.

249
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,959
You get in touch with her parents?

250
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,439
They're both dead.

251
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,405
The only relative she's
got left is the kid.

252
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,164
Hey.

253
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,279
Okay. This is the only
picture we have of him.

254
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,324
Cullen Jr., aged 3 months.

255
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,959
That helps much.

256
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,239
It's the best I could do.

257
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,719
Breakfast, sir? Ma'am?

258
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,959
- Please.
- No. No, no.

259
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,764
That's a first.

260
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,679
Listen, I was just thinking.

261
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,999
Maybe we should take a wild stab
at getting to know each other

262
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,328
before we have to
pretend we're married.

263
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,799
What do you want to know?

264
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,729
How long have we been married?

265
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,199
A long time.

266
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,006
People won't expect us to
talk much to each other.

267
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,999
I want to read it, too. Stop it.

268
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,599
Please? Let me take a look.

269
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,325
Hey, come here.

270
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,810
If you don't stop screwing around back
there, this is what I'll do with you.

271
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,799
Ohh.

272
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,199
What's the matter?

273
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,559
I don't know.

274
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,999
I just don't feel so good.

275
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,519
You hungry?

276
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,290
I got to get out of here right now.

277
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,119
Get those tree stumps out of my
way before I vomit all over them.

278
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,563
Is your wife okay, sir?

279
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,845
Compared to what?

280
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,199
Maybe it was the burrito. Or
it could've been the sausages.

281
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,679
I don't think it was
the crab salad.

282
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,719
It couldn't have been the donuts.

283
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,765
Excuse me.

284
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,922
Oh, I hate feeling like this.

285
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,411
I hate it, too.

286
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,199
Uh-oh.

287
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,759
Uh-oh what?

288
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,919
Uh-oh, pull over.

289
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,039
Now?

290
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,129
Yeah. Please hurry.

291
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,484
The key! Give me the key!

292
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,491
Do you need a hand?

293
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,959
You okay?

294
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,241
I'm fine.

295
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,799
I'll be fine.

296
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,079
Class starts at 9:00
in the morning.

297
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,725
I'll be fine.

298
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,999
You look much better already.

299
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,319
Oh. Kindergarten, 6-year-olds.

300
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,839
That's why I quit
teaching, you know.

301
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,799
I got so sick of
other people's kids.

302
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,324
I was afraid that I'd never
want to have any of my own.

303
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,490
I have a son.

304
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,690
He's 13.

305
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,649
I remember when he was 5.

306
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,839
He lives with his
mother and stepfather.

307
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,519
Aah!

308
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,719
What's the matter?

309
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,810
What... is... that?

310
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,928
Oh, excuse me. I forgot to
tell you. This is my ferret.

311
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,439
He doesn't bite. Don't worry.

312
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,719
Come on. Come on out.

313
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,359
This is all I need, an obstacle.

314
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,039
A goddamn obstacle.

315
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,879
He sends me an obstacle.

316
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,081
Here.

317
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,129
Oh, God.

318
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,919
Don't worry.

319
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,565
I'm going to make it.

320
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,126
I just need a minute.

321
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,679
I'll be ready in just a minute.

322
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,405
I just got...

323
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,089
Oh, God.

324
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,729
How do I look?

325
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,642
Take off the gun.

326
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,325
That's a good idea.

327
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,482
The little bastards are
going to eat you alive.

328
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,599
Get some rest, and don't worry.

329
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,599
I've been working
undercover for a long time.

330
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,122
They're 6-year-olds. How
much trouble can they be?

331
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,439
On second thought,

332
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,130
take the gun.

333
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,519
Matthew...

334
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,439
I sent you to the principal's
office because you punched Jenny.

335
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,291
I know. She poisoned your hamsters.

336
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,519
She told me all about it,
and she's very sorry.

337
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,564
And I'm sorry that I
didn't believe you.

338
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,839
- But you shouldn't punch people.
- But she...

339
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,850
Mr. Kimble, Miss Schlowski
will see you now.

340
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,485
Let's go back to class.

341
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,681
Can I help you?

342
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,526
I'm John Kimble, your new
kindergarten teacher.

343
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,207
We were expecting a Miss O'Hara.

344
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,564
There's been a change of plan.

345
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,839
Four weeks into the new semester,

346
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,159
my superintendent told me I
had to replace Mrs. Hagley,

347
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,762
a kindergarten teacher
of 25 years' experience,

348
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,846
with an undercover police officer,
and he wouldn't even tell me why.

349
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,842
I don't suppose you would do me
the courtesy of filling me in.

350
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,799
I can't do that.

351
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,128
Oh. You can't do that.

352
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,765
I'm watching you.

353
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,079
All I have to do is tell my parents
that you're with the police,

354
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,759
and they'll yank their kids out of this
school so fast, we'd have to close.

355
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,170
And don't you think I won't if I
feel my children are in any danger.

356
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,806
They're not in danger.

357
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,045
I assume you have some
teaching experience.

358
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,522
They wouldn't have
sent me otherwise.

359
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,527
Just wait here a minute.

360
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,681
Everybody sit down on the carpet!

361
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,759
Good morning, everyone.

362
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,521
Good morning, Miss Schlowski.

363
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,639
Your teacher, Mrs. Hagley, had
to go on an important trip.

364
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,959
Where'd she go?

365
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,479
That doesn't matter.

366
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,879
Did she die?

367
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,479
No, Lowell. She went
to see someone.

368
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,839
Did they die?

369
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,849
No, Lowell.

370
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,645
Everyone dies, you know.

371
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,799
I know, but not for
a long, long time.

372
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,759
Now, until Mrs. Hagley comes back,

373
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,203
we have someone special to help.

374
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,448
This is Mr. Kimble, your
new kindergarten teacher.

375
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,399
Now, let's everybody say,
"Good morning, Mr. Kimble."

376
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,810
Good morning, Mr. Kimble.

377
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,646
Good morning.

378
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,447
They're all yours.

379
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,603
I'll be watching you.

380
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,361
Hi.

381
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,245
How are you?

382
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,489
I'm very happy to be here.

383
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,679
First, I would like to
just get to know you.

384
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,521
Quiet.

385
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,361
I'm going to ask you a
bunch of questions.

386
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,447
I want to have them
answered immediately.

387
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,449
How many of you were
born in Astoria?

388
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,689
Raise your hands. Let's see them.

389
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,439
Okay, hmm.

390
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,639
Now, anyone that was
not born in Astoria,

391
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,320
somewhere outside like
California, raise your hands.

392
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,239
Yes.

393
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,681
I need to go to the bathroom.

394
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,924
Okay. You can go.

395
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,919
Boys have a penis.
Girls have a vagina.

396
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,965
Thanks for the tip.

397
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,119
Yes?

398
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,079
I need to go to the bathroom,

399
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,806
and I can't get these things off.

400
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,439
I'll get someone to help you.

401
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,210
I'll be right back, okay?

402
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,999
You've learned that the
"E" is often silent

403
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,090
when it immediately
follows another vowel.

404
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,848
Now write and say these words...

405
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,919
Oh, um...

406
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,079
Class, uh, Catherine,

407
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,930
can you take over for me, please?

408
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,561
Thank you.

409
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,968
"E" is the fifth letter
of the alphabet.

410
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,319
Yes, can I help you?

411
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,045
I have a problem.

412
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,079
Mr. Kimble, I need to go real bad.

413
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,479
First day?

414
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,727
Yes.

415
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,679
I'll take care of her.

416
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,041
Thank you.

417
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,167
You know, kindergarten
is like the ocean.

418
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,484
Don't turn your back on it.

419
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,959
They're okay.

420
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,799
Don't worry. Everything
is under control.

421
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,761
No.

422
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,761
Monsters.

423
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,362
What are you doing with this?

424
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,769
Aren't you going to break it up?

425
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,881
No. Two more days of
this, and he'll quit.

426
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,083
Shut up!

427
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,959
Shut up! Shut up!

428
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,199
Shut up.

429
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,681
No. Don't start this.

430
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,441
Oh, no.

431
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,082
Aah!

432
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,641
Attention!

433
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,810
This is your new class mascot.

434
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,169
What happened to your dog?

435
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,639
This is not a dog.

436
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,959
This is a ferret.

437
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,571
What's a ferret?

438
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,239
That's a ferret.

439
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,799
Oh!

440
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,799
If he bites you, you
get rabies and die.

441
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,639
No. That's not true.
He never bites.

442
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,959
Can I pet him?

443
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,322
Sure, but one at a time, okay?

444
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,168
Good. Okay, next one. Come on.

445
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,640
Yes.

446
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,562
Good. Yeah.

447
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,159
Good. Now we're having fun.

448
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,919
What's that supposed to mean?

449
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,771
Mrs. Hagley is a lot
better than you.

450
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,806
Is she?

451
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,884
Is she really?

452
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,207
My mom's a teacher in this school,

453
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,839
and she's a lot
better than you, too.

454
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,087
Great.

455
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,519
On Monday nights, my mom tutors
and Mrs. Quinn takes care of me.

456
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,484
She's better than you, too.

457
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,081
Great.

458
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,483
And Frankie, my swimming teacher,

459
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,407
and Gus, my T-ball coach,
are better than you, too.

460
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,168
I really appreciate your honesty.

461
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,927
You happen to know someone
that's not better than me?

462
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,568
I don't know that many people.

463
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,039
John?

464
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,640
Are you there?

465
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,090
How did it go?

466
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,606
Go away.

467
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,763
It went that well, huh?

468
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,123
You take over tomorrow.

469
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,443
And blow our cover?

470
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,446
Can't do it.

471
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,645
They're horrible.

472
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,290
Tell me about it.

473
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,364
He's gay. What kind of a man teaches
kindergarten? He's obviously gay.

474
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,370
A male kindergarten teacher
isn't what I'm used to.

475
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,768
Samantha calls him "The Giant."

476
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,519
There he is.

477
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,801
Where, honey?

478
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,039
Holy cow, is that your new teacher?

479
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,119
Yeah.

480
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,845
Oh, my God.

481
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,279
What are you doing?

482
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,079
- I'm not wearing makeup.
- None of us are.

483
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,240
You're married. You're
allowed to look like slobs.

484
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,079
Be good. I'll be
back to pick you up.

485
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,599
Good morning, Mr. Kimble.

486
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,759
Good morning.

487
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,719
I told you he was big.

488
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,410
Play with the kids, honey.

489
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,799
Hi. I'm Jillian, Sylvester's mom.

490
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,686
Do you have a minute?
I'd like to speak with you.

491
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,839
Sure. Please.

492
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,280
Thank you.

493
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,689
A male kindergarten teacher.
That's unusual.

494
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,479
You're not from
around here, are you?

495
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,559
No. I'm not.

496
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,759
Neither am I.

497
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,007
Huh.

498
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,559
Anyway...

499
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,839
Um...

500
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,679
I have a small problem.

501
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,959
Yes?

502
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,403
You see, Sylvester's father
doesn't live with us anymore

503
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,439
and I've just been
worried about Sylvester.

504
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,039
He's been acting a
little strange lately.

505
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,730
You know, doing odd things.

506
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,401
Like what?

507
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,760
Well, it seems that's he's becoming a
little obsessed with playing with dolls.

508
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,446
You know, it's weird.

509
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,799
I think I can help you with that.

510
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,606
- Really?
- He uses the dolls to look up girls' skirts.

511
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,009
I caught him doing it yesterday.

512
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,839
Oh. Oh, well, that's a relief.

513
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,759
But I'll keep an eye on him, okay?

514
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,485
Thank you.

515
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,248
Does Sylvester ever see his father?

516
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,841
No. No, not since he was two.
His father lives in California.

517
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,279
That is far away.

518
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,719
Mmm-hmm.

519
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,208
Well, if you give me
his name and number,

520
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,764
I could talk to him about taking
more interest in his son.

521
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,327
That's very kind, but
I don't think so.

522
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,121
But it's tough on
Sylvester, don't you think?

523
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,519
No.

524
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,327
No, what's tough on Sylvester is his
father left us for another man.

525
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,726
Are you married, Mr. Kimble?

526
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,931
No, I'm not.

527
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,721
He's not married, Mom!

528
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,599
Welcome to Astoria,

529
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,919
the single-parent
capital of America.

530
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,479
Thank you for your time.

531
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,083
I pledge allegiance to the flag

532
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,239
of the United States of America,

533
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,924
and to the republic for which it
stands, one nation under God,

534
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,039
indivisible

535
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,847
with liberty and justice for all.

536
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,011
Are these all your lunches?

537
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,004
You mean you eat other
people's lunches?

538
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,606
Stop it!

539
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,119
Now we're going to do
something extremely fun.

540
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,919
We're going to play a game called,

541
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,691
"Who is my daddy and
what does he do?"

542
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,999
Yes?

543
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,599
Is your daddy a fireman?

544
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,239
He's probably big.
Is he a wrestler?

545
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,319
A basketball coach?

546
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,363
No, no.

547
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,079
What's the matter?

548
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,679
I have a headache.

549
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,039
It might be a tumor.

550
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,685
It's not a tumor!

551
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,565
It's not a tumor at all.

552
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,328
What I meant was you tell me, who
is your daddy and what does he do?

553
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,160
Oh.

554
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,759
Get it?

555
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,610
We start right here. You.

556
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,448
My dad repairs cars driven
by women who are pinheads.

557
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,885
My dad doesn't do
anything since the crash.

558
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,451
My dad gives money to people
that doesn't have money,

559
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,883
and then people use that money,

560
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,279
then they give other money back

561
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,848
and they give the same amount
of money back to my dad.

562
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,039
My dad doesn't live
with us anymore.

563
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,925
He lives in New York
and drives a taxi.

564
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,209
My mom hopes he's going
to die real soon.

565
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,491
My dad watches TV all day long.

566
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,846
My dad works on computers,

567
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,931
and he's, um, the
boss of his company,

568
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,407
and, um, he has a
mustache and a beard.

569
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,999
Mm-hmm.

570
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,119
Yeah.

571
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,519
He doesn't have that
much hair because...

572
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,408
And he... His head is so big
that he can't wear any hats.

573
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,690
My dad's divorced.

574
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,963
My mom's divorced.

575
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,279
My dad, um, is a psychologist,

576
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,931
and he helps people that are hurt or
lost their feelings, and, um, that's it.

577
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,970
Our mom says that our dad
is a real sex machine.

578
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,926
Good.

579
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,324
I don't know what my dad does.

580
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,288
I haven't seen him in a long time.

581
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,485
He lives in France.

582
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,689
My dad is a gynecologist, and he
looks at vaginae all day long.

583
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,005
Thank you. Very good.

584
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,999
Okay. Next, uh...

585
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,043
What's his name with
his back to me?

586
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,239
His name's Zach Sullivan.

587
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,599
He doesn't like anyone
to talk to him.

588
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,959
He's a poo-poo head.

589
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,719
He's a poo-poo face.

590
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,684
He's a ca-ca poo-poo.

591
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,119
He's a poo-poo ca-ca.

592
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:05,679
Poo-poo ca-ca!

593
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,803
Quiet. That's enough.

594
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,201
Hey, Zach.

595
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,724
Did your daddy teach you this game?

596
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,246
Come on, Zach. Let's all play
together. It's so much more fun.

597
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,999
Leave me alone!

598
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,081
What's that?

599
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,326
It's a fire alarm!

600
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,799
Come on, come on.

601
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,479
Everyone together! Come on.

602
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,839
I'm on fire!

603
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,839
Come on. All together!

604
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,405
I'm on fire!

605
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,248
Very straight. Very straight.

606
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,319
Come on, come on. Get all together.

607
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,363
Everything together. Come on.

608
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,159
Come on. Quiet.

609
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,839
Quiet! Come on.

610
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,769
Shh! Quiet.

611
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,119
Well, we're all glad the
kindergarten class could join us.

612
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,531
That's four minutes. You should
be ashamed of yourselves.

613
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,799
All the other grades, your
times were an improvement,

614
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,606
but they're still not good enough.

615
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,883
I'm very disappointed.

616
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,961
All right, let's get
back into school.

617
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,081
Mrs. Sullivan!

618
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,006
Mrs. Sullivan!

619
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,119
So the doctor says
it's a stomach flu.

620
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,687
I'm fine. I can eat
anything I want.

621
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,279
Let's find a restaurant.

622
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,599
Can we talk business?

623
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,799
There are 14 boys in the classroom.

624
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,924
So far I have three possible
suspects, one likely.

625
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,719
Here's a picture. You listening?

626
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,159
I'm listening.

627
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,959
His name's Zach Sullivan.
What do you think?

628
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,999
He's cute. Doesn't
anybody eat around here?

629
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,090
Listen, he's a dead
ringer for Crisp. Look.

630
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,010
Maybe. Come on, John. I'm hungry.

631
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,642
A table for two.
Thank you very much.

632
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,919
Two hot dogs.

633
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,119
Two hot dogs?

634
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,839
Mr. Kimble! Mr. Kimble!

635
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,039
Dominic.

636
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,526
It's him, Mom.

637
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,519
Joyce.

638
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,639
Hello, Joyce.

639
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,839
Dominic has been a great help.
He's a good kid.

640
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,239
Who's that?

641
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,359
Who?

642
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,641
Her.

643
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,119
Oh, that? Uh, that is, uh...

644
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,759
I am his sister.

645
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,039
Oh, really? I wouldn't
have guessed.

646
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,119
You have to excuse my brother.
He has no manners.

647
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,639
My name is Ursula.
Wonderful to meet you.

648
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,559
I'm visiting here from Austria.

649
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,319
I'm Joyce Palmieri.
I work at John's school.

650
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,399
Ah.

651
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,039
And this is Dominic.

652
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,651
Nice to meet you.

653
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,359
Would you like to
join us for dinner?

654
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,759
- No.
- Ja.

655
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,999
Ja.

656
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,248
Yes, of course.
That would be great.

657
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,759
Hi. There will be four of us.

658
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,200
Table 27.

659
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,479
Why did you tell her
you were my sister?

660
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,604
Relax, butch. The
love doctor is here.

661
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,402
Come to me. I want to start.

662
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:49,479
Okay. I want a rib eye steak with mashed
potatoes and a large green salad.

663
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,728
Oh, no. Wait a minute.

664
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,559
I want to start with the
spicy chicken wings.

665
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,199
Are they the tiny
ones without meat?

666
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,119
Actually, it's quite
a large serving.

667
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,559
Ah, good.

668
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,285
Ooh, good arms.

669
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,759
And a large bowl of
the clam chowder.

670
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,567
Uh, and the blueberry pie with
ice cream for dessert. Ja.

671
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,403
I like how they talk.

672
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:23,559
I've been trying to get to know the
parents, but some of them are avoiding me.

673
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,799
Some of them are like that. It's a strange
town that way, especially with new arrivals.

674
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,079
What do you mean?

675
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,639
I think a lot of people
that come to small towns

676
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,479
are trying to get away from something,
or they're hiding something.

677
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,841
Like what?

678
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,519
Well, for example,
what brought you here?

679
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,759
Me? Well, there was an opening
for a kindergarten teacher.

680
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,519
Yeah, but what made you become a kindergarten
teacher? I mean, it is a bit unusual.

681
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,563
John is a bit unusual.

682
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,639
- Well...
- You are.

683
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,959
I was born in Austria. My father was
a teacher. My mother was a teacher.

684
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,079
So is Ursula.

685
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,279
Ja.

686
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,166
We have a tradition in Austria where we
follow the footsteps of our parents.

687
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,239
So, when I moved to this country,

688
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,479
I taught geography and
physical education in Arizona,

689
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,607
and then I coached basketball at an
all-girls school in Rhode Island, but

690
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,964
none of it made me really happy.

691
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,479
Why weren't you happy?

692
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,879
Ja. Why weren't you happy?

693
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,199
Well, I got tired of
teaching teenagers.

694
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,485
Because by the time they came to me, I felt
there wasn't much I could do with them.

695
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,526
I realized that the real
action is in kindergarten.

696
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,088
How long have you been
teaching kindergarten?

697
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,799
It's my second day.

698
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,959
Oh.

699
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,528
Ooh, excuse me, but
it's good. It is good.

700
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,679
Thanks again.

701
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,999
Nice to meet you.

702
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,519
- Thank you.
- Bye.

703
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,679
I had a great time.

704
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,359
Ja, me, too.

705
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,719
Well, Kimble, I think you scored.

706
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,399
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

707
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,359
What are you talking about?

708
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,679
I'm only interested in her
because she works at the school.

709
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,759
She knows the children
and the parents.

710
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,279
If you were any stiffer,
we could take you surfing.

711
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,399
Now, I know you like that woman.
What is your problem?

712
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,279
The only problem I've got
is that I'm doing your job.

713
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,439
You should be cleaning up the paint and
reading stories about bears that go shopping.

714
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,839
I'm stuck with your job.

715
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,959
Yeah. You are.

716
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,400
That's right. I am.

717
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,519
Look, you're going to be
out of here in a few days.

718
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,961
You told me yourself you
had a few good leads.

719
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,843
You'll be back dealing with
junkies and murderers in no time.

720
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,284
They're pushing me around.

721
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,719
Who?

722
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,081
The kids.

723
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,884
They're walking all over me.

724
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,639
Listen, Kimble. You got to handle
this like any other police situation.

725
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,605
You walk into it showing
fear, you're dead,

726
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,002
and those kids know you're scared.

727
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,651
No fear.

728
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,281
No fear.

729
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,919
Today we're going to
play a new fun game.

730
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,964
It's called "police school."

731
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,079
I'm going to be your sheriff.

732
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,559
You're going to be
my deputy trainees.

733
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,647
Come on. Stop whining.

734
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,842
You kids are soft.
You lack discipline.

735
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,919
Well, I've got news for you.

736
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,279
You are mine now. You belong to me!

737
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,279
You're not going to have your
mommies here to wipe your tushies.

738
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,479
Oh, no.

739
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,365
It's time to turn this
mush into muscles.

740
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,686
No more complaining. No more,
"I have to go to the bathroom."

741
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,684
There is no bathroom!

742
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,799
Now, the first thing the
deputy trainees have to learn

743
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,890
is to freeze whenever
you hear this.

744
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,683
Now, the next time you
hear this whistle,

745
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,519
each one of you get one toy.

746
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,639
How many?

747
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,159
One!

748
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,519
Good. Then bring it back
to the carpet, pronto.

749
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,801
Ready?

750
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,079
Wait for it.

751
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,566
Wait for it.

752
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,126
Sit down.

753
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,047
Ready?

754
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,519
Go quickly. Get your toy.

755
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,279
Go. Go for it.

756
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,239
Yes. Very fast.

757
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,999
Good. Quickly. Bring the
toy back to the carpet.

758
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,919
Bring it back to the carpet.

759
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:07,521
Quick, quick, quick.
Back to the carpet.

760
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,520
Quickly.

761
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,606
Emma.

762
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,239
Emma, take your toy to the carpet.

763
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,489
I'm not a policeman.
I'm a princess.

764
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,402
Take your toy back to the carpet.

765
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,843
I'm not a policeman!
I'm a princess.

766
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,841
Take it back!

767
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,765
All right.

768
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,079
Very good.

769
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,691
You did very well.

770
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,124
Now we're going to
play another game.

771
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,439
When you hear two whistle blows,
take your toy back where you got it

772
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,079
and come right back.

773
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,279
How many whistle blows?

774
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,959
Two!

775
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,359
Good. Ready?

776
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,241
Go.

777
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,599
Come on.

778
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,399
Come right back to the carpet.

779
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,599
Yes. It works. This is great.

780
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:14,250
Faster, faster. Come on. Yes. Come
back. Terrific. This is working. Wait.

781
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,966
I mean, you're very good deputies.

782
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,484
Your sheriff is proud of you.

783
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,639
One, two, three, four.

784
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,719
One, two, three, four.

785
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,763
One, two, three, four.

786
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,446
Wait! Take me.

787
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,879
Down. Up. Down.

788
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,199
Yes, yes, yes! You've got it.

789
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,529
Yes, Wanda. Good.

790
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,959
Very good.

791
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,919
Big circles. Big circles. Good.

792
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:06,081
Now do the same thing. Way back.
And down in big circles. Big circles.

793
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,561
Yes.

794
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,959
This is a fire drill!

795
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,519
This is a fire drill.

796
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,881
Run to the door.

797
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:37,846
Dominic, don't forget Ferret.
Yes. It's a fire drill. Come on.

798
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,049
Oh, this is terrible.

799
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,562
Come on. Come on.

800
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,159
29.

801
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,519
30.

802
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,559
31.

803
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,319
32.

804
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,885
33.

805
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,759
One more. Come on.
Down and up. Yes!

806
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:02,759
Yes! Zach is the winner.
Come on, you guys.

807
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,959
March, two, three, four.
March, two, three, four.

808
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,679
Swing your arms, two, three, four.

809
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,279
Swing them high. Two, three, four.

810
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,610
One, two, three, four.

811
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,846
Wow.

812
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,119
One, two, three, four.

813
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,079
Reading, writing, arithmetic.

814
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,559
Reading, writing, arithmetic!

815
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,719
Too much homework makes me sick.

816
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,239
Too much homework makes me sick!

817
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,399
When it's time to pass the test...

818
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,879
When it's time to pass the test...

819
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,999
Kindergarten is the best.

820
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,199
Kindergarten is the best.

821
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,039
E-I-E-I-O

822
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,239
And on that farm he had a duck

823
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,091
E-I-E-I-O

824
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,930
All right. Take your milk.

825
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,248
It makes you big and strong.

826
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,599
It's story time, Mr. Kimble.

827
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,719
All right.

828
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:20,279
We all like this one and if you read us a
story now, everybody will go to sleep.

829
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,481
All right.

830
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,159
I used to read this to my son.

831
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,879
What's his name?

832
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,999
Who?

833
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,486
Your son.

834
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,159
Oh, Alex is his name.

835
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,691
Where is he?

836
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,845
He lives with his mother.

837
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,919
You see, his mother
and I, we are...

838
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,519
Divorced. I know.

839
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,324
What's a divorce?

840
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:04,159
It's when your daddy lives someplace
else and comes over to take you places,

841
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,727
and your mommy says
he's a deadbeat.

842
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,999
No. It's when the daddy doesn't
want to see his little boy anymore.

843
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,759
That's not what it is.

844
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,203
Why don't you want to see
your little boy? Was he bad?

845
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,049
No, he was not bad.

846
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,050
It wasn't his fault at all.

847
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:28,129
You see, his mommy and
I, we just nev...

848
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,325
Just sit down, okay?

849
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,639
Let me just start reading.

850
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,490
Why don't you all lie down?

851
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,401
Okay.

852
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,969
Good. And rest.

853
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,409
"If you were a bird
and lived on high

854
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,964
"you'd lean on the wind
when the wind came by.

855
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,684
"You'd say to the wind
when it took you away,

856
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,281
"that's where I wanted to go today.

857
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,763
"Where am I going?
I don't quite know.

858
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,051
"What does it matter
where people go?

859
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,411
"Down to the wood where
the bluebells grow.

860
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:20,609
"Anywhere. Anywhere. I don't know."

861
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,559
Hi.

862
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,847
Hi.

863
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,005
I didn't mean to startle you.

864
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,890
I must have dozed off.

865
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,042
I can't believe you got
them all to sleep.

866
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,005
I worked them hard.

867
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:34,006
I was wondering if you'd like to come
to my place for dinner tomorrow night.

868
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,370
I would like that.

869
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,166
Yes.

870
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,086
Great. Well, here
are the directions.

871
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,770
How about 6:30, 7:00?

872
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,046
That would be fine.

873
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,527
What?

874
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,887
Um...

875
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:00,446
You... You've got a
little mustache.

876
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,042
Oh, it must be from the milk.

877
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,366
Well, I'd better get back to class.

878
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,359
I'll see you tomorrow.

879
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,130
See you tomorrow.

880
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,919
Freeze!

881
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,246
No!

882
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,281
No.

883
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,250
This is Henry Shoop, my fiancé.

884
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,521
Hi.

885
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,639
Your fiancé?

886
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,439
Yeah, my fiancé.

887
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:34,999
Henry, this is obviously
my partner, John Kimble.

888
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,884
Oh, jeez. Uh...

889
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,559
- Hi.
- How you doing?

890
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,491
Let me get this,
and I'll be right out.

891
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,079
Oh!

892
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,770
It's okay, honey.

893
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,765
I'll be right out.

894
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,119
It's my birthday.

895
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,439
Well, congratulations.

896
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,119
Thanks. He came up here
just to surprise me.

897
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:56,211
And he made me my
favorite. Pasta a olio.

898
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,959
I love you, Henry.

899
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,279
I love you, too, Phoebes.

900
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,159
Uh... Well, I've got
to head back tonight.

901
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,679
I've got to work.

902
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,279
Henry's a chef.

903
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,639
I'm a chef.

904
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,959
You're marrying a chef?

905
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,839
I'm marrying a great chef.

906
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,159
That figures.

907
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,479
You mean that, a great chef?

908
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,319
Of course. You're a genius, Henry.

909
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,719
Not just a good chef?

910
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,199
Well, nice to meet you.
Congratulations. Happy birthday.

911
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,479
Thanks. You want some of this?

912
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,319
It wasn't overcooked?

913
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,479
You're the best.

914
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,966
It wasn't a little overcooked?
No. Al dente.

915
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,647
Zach.

916
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,439
Excuse me. I'm John
Kimble, Zach's teacher.

917
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,439
I didn't know he was following me.

918
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,159
Hi. I've been leaving
messages on your machine.

919
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,919
I'm sorry. Things have been hectic.

920
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,610
What about now?

921
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,411
Uh...

922
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,283
Go for a little walk. Your
teacher and I have to talk.

923
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,040
Uh...

924
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,444
I know what this is about.

925
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,007
I suppose you saw the
bruises on Zach's legs?

926
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,159
My husband has started
counseling about this.

927
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,964
He's been going for
three weeks now.

928
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:41,243
Please don't bring the school system
into it. It will make matters worse.

929
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,531
He's beating you, too?

930
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,999
If he wasn't going to counseling, I could
see the point of saying something.

931
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,680
But I'm sure there won't
be any more occurrences.

932
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,124
You won't say anything, will you?

933
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,520
Please?

934
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,689
If he does it again,
I press charges.

935
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,286
Zach.

936
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,761
You got the stuff?

937
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,961
Thanks, man.

938
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,687
Here, lady. I gave her your stuff.
Where's the rest of my money?

939
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,570
Who are you, old lady?

940
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,844
Your fairy godmother.

941
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,801
Come in.

942
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,639
Hi. It took all day, but I found out
Zach Sullivan and his mother...

943
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,491
- Aren't related to Crisp.
- I just found out.

944
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:17,239
Oh. I got a bottle of
wine for your big date...

945
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,119
It's not a date, I know.

946
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,199
But Joyce shouldn't think that.

947
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,999
Thanks. I don't think
it's a good idea.

948
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,201
Why not?

949
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,359
Quickest way to slip up
doing undercover work

950
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,211
is doing things you
normally wouldn't do.

951
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,919
Wait a minute.

952
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:37,559
You mean you wouldn't take wine to a
woman who's invited you for dinner?

953
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,845
Of course you would. And
flowers as well. Here you go.

954
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,367
She'll love them.

955
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,400
Well, here we are.

956
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,208
Wow. This is quite a place.

957
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,999
They must be paying you a lot
more than they're paying me.

958
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,559
I wish it was my house. It
belongs to a friend of mine.

959
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:18,322
After the divorce, he said we could stay
here in exchange for keeping the place up.

960
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:20,879
You must have nice friends.

961
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,241
Yes, I do.

962
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,931
Dinner won't be ready
for a few minutes.

963
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,811
Can you start a fire?

964
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,079
It shouldn't be a problem.

965
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,839
I'll show you where the wood is.

966
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,041
All right.

967
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,610
Come on. Come on!

968
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:39,961
Right here.

969
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,006
In here.

970
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,399
This is my secret hiding spot.

971
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,399
Wow. This is amazing.

972
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,090
I made it myself.

973
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,399
- What's this?
- Don't touch that!

974
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,285
It's a laser, and it'll burn
a hole right through you.

975
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,806
Okay. I'll be careful.

976
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,439
Oh, don't shoot.

977
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,519
Boom! Boom!

978
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,639
Don't shoot.

979
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,250
I put up these lasers
to protect us.

980
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,919
To protect you from what?

981
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,804
The bad people.

982
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,323
Do you want to see something else?

983
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,766
Come on.

984
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,359
What?

985
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,289
See that?

986
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,006
You mean the tower?

987
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,330
I'm going to plant one of
my lasers on that antenna.

988
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,959
But I'll have to do it at night.

989
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,004
Otherwise the bad people
will know where it is.

990
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:47,004
Last one to the table
is a rotten banana!

991
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,999
Have you guys had fun?

992
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,770
- Yeah.
- Be right out!

993
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,679
What you doing in there?

994
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:55,564
I'm lost. Where is the dining
room? This house is huge.

995
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,928
Follow me, silly.

996
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,927
These are beautiful pictures
of you and Dominic.

997
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,767
Thank you.

998
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,922
When I was putting Dominic to bed,
he mentioned you had a son, too.

999
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,891
That's right. But I'm divorced.

1000
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:17,919
I'm lucky. My ex got remarried
to a very nice man.

1001
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,884
He's really good to my son.

1002
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,290
I see him a lot.

1003
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,599
What about your ex-husband?
Does he see Dominic a lot?

1004
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,486
Uh, no. After the divorce,
he moved back to France.

1005
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,970
What about child
support and alimony?

1006
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,359
Does he take care of you?

1007
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,483
I'm sorry about being so personal.

1008
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:48,169
I was so glad to see him go I
didn't worry about that part.

1009
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,439
Dominic doesn't even remember him.

1010
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,369
I prefer it that way.

1011
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,246
Are you sure?

1012
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,801
Yeah.

1013
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,319
Why?

1014
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:06,482
Well, Dominic was talking to me
about having to move around a lot

1015
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,650
to keep the bad people away.

1016
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,199
Bad people?

1017
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,359
Something about having to leave
in the middle of the night

1018
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,050
and leave his toys behind.

1019
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,005
Oh, God.

1020
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,322
I thought he'd
forgotten about that.

1021
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,846
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to upset you.

1022
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,765
It's not your fault.

1023
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,091
The truth is, my ex-husband
is a walking nightmare.

1024
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,608
He didn't leave us, we left him.

1025
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,531
He found out where we were
and tried to kidnap Dominic.

1026
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,043
He doesn't know where we are now,
and I'd like to keep it that way.

1027
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:56,040
Of course. I'm glad he's in
France and doesn't live nearby.

1028
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,489
He doesn't live in France.

1029
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,406
I told Dominic that
he lived in France.

1030
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,724
I didn't know who my ex-husband
was when I married him.

1031
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,563
I was young and stupid,
and I made a mistake.

1032
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:25,722
I don't want Dominic to pay for it.

1033
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,564
Look, nobody around here
knows anything about this.

1034
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,402
I can't even believe I told you.

1035
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:44,086
You have to promise me
you won't tell anyone.

1036
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,405
You can trust me.

1037
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:58,319
That's very good. Perfect.
Okay. Let's try it again.

1038
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,119
Mary, you first.

1039
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:04,239
Four scores and seven years ago.

1040
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:07,922
Four scores and seven years ago.

1041
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,329
Our forefathers brought...

1042
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,960
Four fathers?

1043
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,759
Mr. Kimble, did Lincoln
have four fathers?

1044
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,079
Uh...

1045
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,519
I had three fathers.

1046
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,609
One named Walt, two named Ralph.

1047
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,644
Did Lincoln have four mothers?

1048
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,239
As a matter of fact,
he had two mothers.

1049
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,442
Unfortunately, the first one died.

1050
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,319
I knew it.

1051
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,599
Um... Okay.

1052
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,519
Let's take a break. Come on.

1053
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:44,651
I want you to walk
around in a circle. Go.

1054
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,091
Start. Come on.

1055
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,919
Well, Joyce's story about
the house checked out.

1056
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:57,439
It belongs to a guy who only
uses it during the ski season.

1057
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:02,039
She's got under $1,000 in the
bank, no stocks, no bonds,

1058
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,639
no other assets under the
name Joyce Palmieri.

1059
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:08,287
Her teacher's salary is less
than mine, which is pathetic.

1060
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,839
Keep looking. Check for offshore
accounts under Dominic's name...

1061
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,328
She doesn't live like someone
with millions of dollars.

1062
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,839
She doesn't even seem the type.

1063
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,247
Kimble, this might not be her.

1064
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,799
It's got to be her.

1065
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:26,005
Why? Because she doesn't want to have
anything to do with her ex-husband?

1066
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,199
I know it's her.

1067
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,639
Know what I think?

1068
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,842
You want it to be her.

1069
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,004
You really like her,
and it's scaring you.

1070
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,599
Excuse me!

1071
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,919
Surprise!

1072
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:39,999
Ladies!

1073
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,725
Ladies, surprise.

1074
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,119
Obviously, I'm not
into baking cakes,

1075
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,679
so I brought these little things
to donate for the raffle prizes.

1076
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,319
Who the hell is that?

1077
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:56,319
She's the one I was
telling you about.

1078
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,205
Her husband ran away
with another guy.

1079
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,249
It's been terrible for her.

1080
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,519
You're not getting
mellow on me, are you?

1081
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,679
Three, four.

1082
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,199
- Hi.
- One, two, three...

1083
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,319
Hi.

1084
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,679
Come on. One, two, three, four.

1085
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,564
Come on. Go, go.

1086
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,879
I see they stuck you with the
Gettysburg Address this year.

1087
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,730
They sure did.

1088
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,245
Company, halt!

1089
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,241
Um...

1090
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,924
About last night...

1091
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,484
I've been thinking about it, and...

1092
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,602
I'm glad I told you
all those things.

1093
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,651
So am I.

1094
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,919
Um, I... I better get going.

1095
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,441
Yeah. I have to get going, too.

1096
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,599
Is everything okay?

1097
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,881
Yeah.

1098
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,610
See you tomorrow at the fair.

1099
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:04,850
I'm looking forward to it.

1100
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,759
What are you looking at?

1101
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,087
Shh!

1102
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,045
March! One, two, three, four.

1103
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,281
I was just talking to the
teacher, that's all.

1104
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,599
Yeah. Don't laugh.

1105
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:27,759
Okay. I'm proud of you. Keep going.

1106
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,008
I'm sorry Zach's late.
The car wouldn't start.

1107
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,286
You be a good boy. I love you.

1108
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,879
Hi, champ.

1109
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,127
Oh!

1110
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,731
What's the matter?

1111
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,886
Oh, no.

1112
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,890
I fell down again.

1113
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,730
Hey, wait a minute.

1114
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,286
Uh...

1115
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,959
I forgot to close the door to the
basement, and Zach had a bad fall.

1116
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,719
The doctor says it's not
as bad as it looks.

1117
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,599
You all say the same
thing, "He fell down."

1118
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,599
Don't you have anything
better to say?

1119
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,679
It's true!

1120
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:09,201
I don't have to justify
myself to you!

1121
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,928
You have no right talking
to me like that.

1122
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,999
How are you doing?

1123
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,159
You must be the Mr. Kimble
we hear so much about.

1124
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:21,479
You hit the kid, I hit you.

1125
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,011
You bastard!

1126
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,045
You're not worth it.

1127
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,882
I'm pressing charges against you.

1128
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,728
Excuse me, everybody.

1129
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,479
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have hit the man,
especially in front of the children.

1130
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,045
It was a mistake.

1131
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,325
I checked you out.

1132
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,199
There is no record of you ever
having taught at any public school,

1133
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,368
in California or anywhere else.

1134
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:12,801
Mr. Kimble, you have no teaching
experience whatsoever, do you?

1135
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,359
Someone finally noticed.

1136
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:20,079
I thought the introduction of
a ferret was a horrible idea,

1137
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,850
but the children seemed to like it.

1138
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:25,719
I thought the use of your police
whistle was outrageous...

1139
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,199
That's all I could think of.

1140
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,244
Please allow me to finish.

1141
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,126
Sorry.

1142
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,610
But it worked.

1143
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:40,684
I have no idea what kind
of police officer you are,

1144
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,807
but you're a very good teacher.

1145
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,205
Thank you.

1146
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:57,404
Now, will you tell me
something? Don't lie.

1147
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:03,121
What did it feel like to
hit that son of a bitch?

1148
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,882
It felt great.

1149
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,646
Yeah.

1150
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:17,279
Well, tomorrow morning.

1151
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,279
Bright and early.

1152
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:20,519
Thank you.

1153
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,881
Yeah.

1154
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:34,085
Yeah, that's her.

1155
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,885
And there goes our goddamn case.

1156
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,159
Tell O'Hara and Kimble their witness
is dead, so Crisp is going to walk.

1157
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,039
We want them back here.

1158
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:45,049
We've got lots of
other cases to clear.

1159
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,759
O'Hara says they think
they've located the wife.

1160
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,959
And the money?

1161
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,479
They're looking into it.

1162
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,559
Bullshit.

1163
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,559
Have them tell the wife we're letting
Crisp go, and he knows where she is.

1164
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,919
If she wants police protection,
she'll produce the money.

1165
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,121
Yes, sir.

1166
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,719
Sorry it took so long, Cullen.

1167
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:02,285
Hey, you're looking great.

1168
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,525
I love you, Mother.

1169
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,849
We're going to be a
family again, son.

1170
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,007
Go!

1171
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,399
Fourscore and seven years ago...

1172
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:18,199
Fourscore and seven years ago...

1173
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:22,239
Our forefathers brought
forth on this continent...

1174
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:26,399
Our forefathers brought
forth on this continent...

1175
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,879
A new nation...

1176
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,879
A new nation...

1177
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,119
Conceived in liberty...

1178
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:34,719
Conceived in liberty...

1179
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,319
And dedicated to the proposition...

1180
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,439
And dedicated to the proposition...

1181
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,559
That all men are created equal...

1182
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,999
That all men are created equal...

1183
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,759
And that government...

1184
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,959
And that government...

1185
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,199
Of the people...

1186
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,279
By the people...

1187
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,759
And for the people...

1188
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:58,203
Shall not perish from this earth.

1189
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,009
Thank you very much.

1190
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,119
Oh!

1191
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:24,530
I'd like to introduce you to
our kindergarten teacher.

1192
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,959
He came to us as a
substitute teacher,

1193
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:32,131
and he's proven to be
a wonderful asset.

1194
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,959
Let's welcome him
into our community

1195
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,085
and hope that he considers
staying on a permanent basis.

1196
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,319
Ladies and gentlemen,

1197
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,879
Mr. John Kimble.

1198
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,439
Nice town.

1199
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:22,801
Hmm.

1200
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:27,201
Ahh! Smell that fresh air.

1201
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,199
We should think about
buying something up here,

1202
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:33,722
like some log cabin in
the woods near a lake.

1203
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,119
Kids love that outdoor
kind of stuff.

1204
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:38,049
I'll be in the pharmacy.

1205
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,129
Try not to step in anything.

1206
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,799
I'd like to help you.

1207
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,082
But we're pretty much out
of the race cars, unless...

1208
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,609
This is the last one.

1209
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,559
It's still in great shape.

1210
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,479
If you don't mind
waiting, I'll wrap it up.

1211
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,919
I'll knock 10% off...

1212
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,919
I have a better idea.

1213
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,248
I'll pay you twice
what he's charging.

1214
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,046
I promised my boy I'd get him one.

1215
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,439
I'd love to help you, but my kid's
been bugging me since Christmas.

1216
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,679
I'll pay you four times
what it's worth.

1217
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,769
Get your kid something even better.

1218
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,441
Sorry. Can you gift-wrap it?

1219
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,159
Hanna, could you wrap that, please?

1220
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,600
No harm in trying.

1221
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:36,847
Tourists.

1222
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,079
Great, Dominic. You're doing well.

1223
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,199
I'll wait over here for you, okay?

1224
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,401
Okay.

1225
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:58,919
Great day, huh?

1226
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,719
We've run out of time.

1227
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:03,048
We've got to press Joyce now.

1228
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,759
What do you mean?

1229
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,279
Cindy O.D.'d last night.

1230
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:07,399
Shit.

1231
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,439
They released Crisp this morning.
He's probably on his way here.

1232
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,599
Salazar told me to tell you this.

1233
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,199
If Joyce is Crisp's wife,

1234
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,959
she's got to cooperate
about the money,

1235
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,959
or she gets no police protection.

1236
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,279
Bastard.

1237
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,290
Ursula, how are you?

1238
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,761
What?

1239
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:35,004
I've got to tell you the truth.

1240
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,479
Her name's not Ursula.

1241
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,125
She's not my sister.

1242
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,879
I beg your pardon?

1243
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:42,809
We're not who you think we are.

1244
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,206
What is this?

1245
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,125
We're police officers.

1246
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,239
We know who you are...

1247
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,319
Rachel.

1248
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:57,519
This is a joke, right?

1249
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:00,639
No. This is no joke.
You took $3 million.

1250
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:01,719
I think...

1251
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,241
Crisp knows where you are.
He could be here any minute.

1252
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:06,919
Where's Dominic?

1253
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:11,519
You'll get immunity for your
testimony, but we need you to help us.

1254
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,839
Where's Dominic?

1255
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,399
On a pony.

1256
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,679
We'll offer protection if you
tell us about the money.

1257
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:19,279
There's no money,
you son of a bitch.

1258
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,720
There never was!

1259
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,199
No, it's not fair!

1260
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,719
I'm not finished yet!

1261
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:27,679
The bad people have found us.

1262
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:30,519
What do you mean, "no money?"

1263
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:31,879
Why are you mad at Mr. Kimble?

1264
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,570
Because he's a jerk.

1265
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:36,004
Leave me alone!

1266
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,919
Joyce, wait! Wait!

1267
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,919
If you didn't take the
money, why is he after you?

1268
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:46,849
He doesn't want me.
He wants Dominic.

1269
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,919
She's going to run again.

1270
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:58,246
Yeah.

1271
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,879
Unless we do something about it.

1272
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:03,445
Yeah.

1273
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,762
Hey, snap out of it!

1274
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,119
Daryl. Daryl.

1275
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,479
I'm sorry. I wanted to
give you a second chance.

1276
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:18,886
$200 cash.

1277
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,770
What is wrong with you?

1278
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,559
I'm still not getting through
to you, am I, Daryl?

1279
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,639
Mother, got this great
surprise for Junior.

1280
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,599
That'll be $57.90.

1281
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,599
$57.90.

1282
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:45,409
Children's aspirin, children's
decongestant, antihistamine.

1283
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:49,279
A thermometer?

1284
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:52,759
A lot of flu going around, right?

1285
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,119
It is the season.

1286
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,639
The boy's not sick.

1287
01:23:55,640 --> 01:23:57,599
Doesn't hurt to take precautions.

1288
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,159
Mother, you are going
to make him sick.

1289
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:05,439
You stuffed all this crap into
me, and nothing was wrong.

1290
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,166
That's why there was
nothing wrong with you.

1291
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,925
Now, how can you argue with that?

1292
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,127
Joyce!

1293
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,648
Joyce! Dominic!

1294
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,239
You bastard! Where's Dominic?

1295
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,559
I don't know. What happened?

1296
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,039
You led him here. If he has
Dominic, I'll kill you.

1297
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,599
Let go of me!

1298
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,559
We'll find him. Stop it.

1299
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:09,719
We'll find him.

1300
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,399
Dominic!

1301
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,679
Did he say anything before he left?

1302
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:17,399
He said something about
getting his lasers.

1303
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:21,571
Lasers? I think I know where he is.

1304
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,044
Aah! Help!

1305
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,604
Help! Help!

1306
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:02,439
Somebody! Help!

1307
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:03,519
Hold on!

1308
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,119
I'll get him down.

1309
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,319
Help!

1310
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,319
Hold on. I'm right here.

1311
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:09,639
Good boy.

1312
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:11,759
All right. Just hold on.

1313
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:14,599
Okay. Just hold on.

1314
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,599
Oh, good. Okay.

1315
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:20,239
I was going to put the
lasers in the antenna.

1316
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,408
I know. Don't worry
about anything now.

1317
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:26,079
I got you. Just hold on tight now.

1318
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,691
Hold on tight, okay?

1319
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:28,961
Good.

1320
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:39,599
If I lost Dominic, I don't
think I could go on living.

1321
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,199
You're not going to lose him.

1322
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,767
That's right. I'm not.

1323
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:51,846
Cullen said I stole his money so these
creeps would follow us for a reward.

1324
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:54,439
You don't know what he's like.

1325
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:57,479
Oh, yes, I do. I know him well.

1326
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,479
That's why I don't want
him to get you two.

1327
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,479
Can't trust you or anybody.

1328
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,839
You can trust me.

1329
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,644
That's what you said before.

1330
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,090
And you turned out to be a cop.

1331
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,365
I... I didn't mean to hurt you.

1332
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:17,799
I wish I was a
kindergarten teacher,

1333
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,809
but I'm not.

1334
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,159
I'm a cop.

1335
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,089
That's all I know how to be.

1336
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,290
I have to get out of here.

1337
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:29,886
You have a son.

1338
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:32,249
If you were me, you'd
do the same thing.

1339
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,524
I have a son I've hardly
seen in seven years.

1340
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,369
I don't mean anything to him.

1341
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,845
My ex-wife got remarried.

1342
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:49,451
She doesn't want me
to be part of his life.

1343
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,522
I lost my family.

1344
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,039
I should never have let it happen.

1345
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:02,242
Why are you telling me all of this?

1346
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:06,248
I don't want to lose you.

1347
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:12,324
I don't want to lose Dominic.

1348
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:20,325
I swear you'll never have
to run from him again.

1349
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:37,879
Don't worry about anything, okay?
We're going to be right across the hall.

1350
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,399
Everything's going to be fine.

1351
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,359
We just want to be extra careful.

1352
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:42,479
Thanks.

1353
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:43,761
Don't worry.

1354
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:51,126
All right, all right. Settle down.

1355
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,399
Good morning.

1356
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:01,571
Good morning, Mr. Kimble.

1357
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,959
Sit down.

1358
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:06,999
It's very nice to
see you all again.

1359
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,959
Meet my very good
friend, Phoebe O'Hara.

1360
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:13,279
Good morning, Phoebe.

1361
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:17,279
Miss O'Hara is going to talk to you
about something very important.

1362
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:21,759
So pay attention to what
she has to say, okay?

1363
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,119
Remember, no fear.

1364
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:26,129
Thanks.

1365
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,286
Yeah?

1366
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:33,679
Boys have a penis.
Girls have a vagina.

1367
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,359
Well, you taught them the basics.

1368
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,159
That's important.

1369
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:48,479
Okay, now, today
we're going to talk

1370
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,519
about something else
that's really important.

1371
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,929
Today we're going to
talk about strangers.

1372
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:59,645
If a stranger knocks on your
door, never answer the door.

1373
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:02,239
Because we never talk to strangers.

1374
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:03,679
Let's say that together.

1375
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:07,439
We never talk to strangers.

1376
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,559
Right.

1377
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,999
Can we talk to kids?

1378
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,599
Yeah, it's okay.
You can talk to kids.

1379
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,245
What about dogs?

1380
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,839
Huh?

1381
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,799
Can we talk to dogs?

1382
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,239
Yeah, you can talk to dogs.

1383
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,239
But what you can't do,

1384
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:26,759
what you must never ever do is...

1385
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:31,090
Never talk to strangers.

1386
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,919
On the kindergarten level,

1387
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:37,439
we try to emphasize the three C's:

1388
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:41,486
Caring, courtesy and courage.

1389
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:44,799
Courage.

1390
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,359
That's my philosophy, too.

1391
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:49,359
Are you a single parent, Mr. Green?

1392
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:54,043
No, my wife had to stay behind to
complete the sale of our home.

1393
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:58,560
I'm checking the schools
before we buy a home here.

1394
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:02,039
Most kindergarten
children can't read yet.

1395
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,279
My son can.

1396
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,319
He reads at 6? That's good.

1397
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,719
And writes. I taught him myself.

1398
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:09,888
He sounds like a special child.

1399
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,799
He is. He's a great athlete.

1400
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,479
Here's what you've waited
for. The kindergarten.

1401
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:16,999
Have a look.

1402
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:20,039
Oh, Dominic, Dominic,

1403
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,599
Dominic is king of the mountain!

1404
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:25,119
Way to go, Dominic.

1405
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,679
Here's your crown.

1406
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:27,879
Congratulations, Dominic.

1407
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,759
The king of Mount Kimble!

1408
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,119
Dominic.

1409
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:34,919
Ahh!

1410
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,999
He looks odd, but he's
a wonderful teacher.

1411
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,039
Yes, I'm sure he is.

1412
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:50,279
Did you see Cullen Jr.?

1413
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:51,639
Yeah, yeah.

1414
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:53,239
She calls him Dominic.

1415
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:55,599
She'd always wanted
to name him Dominic.

1416
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,439
What a dumb name.

1417
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,120
Put that cigar out.
It's unhealthy for the kid.

1418
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:57,848
Then you make your airplane
go up into the clouds.

1419
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:03,039
Check it out.

1420
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,359
Right.

1421
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:05,999
Okay, stay calm.

1422
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,079
Okay, it's probably a fire drill.

1423
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:10,279
Oh, man.

1424
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,679
Kimble, the hallway's
full of smoke.

1425
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:15,679
Okay, this is a fire drill.
Come on.

1426
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,239
This is the real thing.

1427
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:18,919
Just the way we practiced.

1428
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:21,279
Go out there.

1429
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,529
Fast. Just the way we practiced it.

1430
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:30,564
Come on.

1431
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:37,199
Come on.

1432
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:39,926
It's only water. Don't be scared.

1433
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,999
Stay close to the wall. Let's go.

1434
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,159
Come on. Come on.

1435
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:49,679
Dominic, stay close to me, okay?

1436
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:51,559
Stay close to me.

1437
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:56,759
Stay behind me.

1438
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:58,246
Don't get separated.

1439
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,559
Aah!

1440
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:14,639
Are you all right?

1441
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,519
Come on. Let's go.

1442
01:34:16,520 --> 01:34:18,165
Dominic, wait!

1443
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,762
Dominic!

1444
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,759
Help! Somebody help me!

1445
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:27,879
Help!

1446
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:30,999
Stranger!

1447
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,599
- Stranger!
- Stranger!

1448
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,759
Stranger!

1449
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,959
Dominic! Where's Dominic?

1450
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,650
Dominic!

1451
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:06,319
Okay, stay together. Stay together.

1452
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:10,279
Stay together. Hold
onto your partner.

1453
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:11,839
Okay, don't lag behind.

1454
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,319
Hold onto my hand.

1455
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:14,599
Stay together.

1456
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,039
Where's Dominic?

1457
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:18,279
He's inside. Kimble's
looking for him.

1458
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:19,481
Joyce!

1459
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:20,887
Joyce!

1460
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,679
Help!

1461
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:54,439
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm not going to hurt you.

1462
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:56,563
I'm not going to hurt you.

1463
01:35:56,760 --> 01:35:57,839
It's okay.

1464
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,799
I'm a fireman.

1465
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:01,650
I help people.

1466
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:08,047
Well, where's your hat?

1467
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:10,406
My hat?

1468
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:12,891
I love this.

1469
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:17,679
I can't fool my own boy.
He's just 6 years old.

1470
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:21,805
You're right. I'm no jerk fireman.

1471
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:26,279
I'm going to tell you
something, Dominic.

1472
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,279
It's going to be hard
for you to understand,

1473
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:32,211
but you got to believe me.

1474
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:40,319
I'm your father, Dominic.

1475
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:42,409
Your father.

1476
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,408
Don't you recognize me?

1477
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:48,279
No.

1478
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:49,799
Sure you do. It's me.

1479
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,970
Don't you remember twinkle,
twinkle, little star?

1480
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:56,599
We have the same kind of hands.

1481
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,359
Don't you remember?

1482
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:01,839
You're not my father.
My father lives in France.

1483
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:05,319
Your mother told you that,
but that's not true!

1484
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:06,759
I'm your father!

1485
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:09,239
I've been searching for
you for five years.

1486
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:12,119
Help! Help!

1487
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:13,639
Dominic, I'm your father.

1488
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:17,242
You're going to have to do what
I say. Do you understand?

1489
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:21,919
Freeze!

1490
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,079
Don't you know there's a fire?

1491
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:26,839
We thought it was another drill.

1492
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:28,405
Well, get out!

1493
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:29,801
Yes, sir.

1494
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:50,679
Whoa, honey.
That's a fire in there.

1495
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:54,519
I got a kid in there. I'm a cop.

1496
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:57,039
If I need a ticket
fixed, I'll call you.

1497
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:58,959
In the meantime, stay out. Go on.

1498
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,241
All right.

1499
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:39,202
Quiet, you hear me? Quiet.

1500
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:46,999
No!

1501
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,399
Rachel!

1502
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,679
Let go!

1503
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:51,039
Just what I need.

1504
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:52,559
Please, let him go.

1505
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:54,039
Let him go!

1506
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,288
How the hell do you
get out of here?

1507
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:01,288
Please, please, don't do this!

1508
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,119
You're scaring him!

1509
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:06,359
Scared? Of course he's scared.

1510
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,439
You told him lies about me.

1511
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:11,159
My son doesn't know
me because of you.

1512
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:13,399
Listen! Just listen.

1513
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:15,399
You stole him from me!

1514
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,039
Please, give him back.

1515
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,559
Don't touch him!

1516
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:21,889
Dominic, I had to do it!

1517
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,039
I didn't want to do it.
She made me.

1518
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,925
Everything's going
to be okay, Dominic.

1519
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,399
Dominic?

1520
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:31,761
Come back.

1521
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:35,650
We're getting out of here. Dominic?

1522
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:39,486
Going to start a whole new family.

1523
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:43,366
Dominic!

1524
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:47,119
Gotcha!

1525
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:49,448
I love you. Do you understand?

1526
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:51,999
Tell me you understand that.

1527
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,079
Say it. Say it!

1528
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:56,965
I understand.

1529
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,004
Daddy.

1530
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:02,199
Daddy.

1531
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:06,199
Hold it! Right there.
Drop it! Hurry!

1532
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:07,799
Don't. Don't.

1533
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:10,559
He's not your hostage.
He's your son.

1534
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:12,039
Drop it. On the floor.

1535
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:13,959
You'll do this to your own son?

1536
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:16,959
Drop it! I'm losing it! Hurry!

1537
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:19,079
Relax. I'm putting it down.

1538
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,327
Hurry!

1539
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,599
Here it is. Here it is.

1540
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:25,201
Just don't harm the boy, okay?

1541
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:29,199
Good. Good. That's smart.

1542
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:31,119
All right.

1543
01:40:31,120 --> 01:40:34,159
Why don't you let the boy go now?

1544
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:35,639
The boy is mine!

1545
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:37,159
He's my boy!

1546
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:39,839
You get your own goddamn family!

1547
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:43,687
No!

1548
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:57,279
Are you okay?

1549
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:58,999
I'm okay. Get Dominic.

1550
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,999
Okay. Dominic!

1551
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,519
Dominic!

1552
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,322
Where's my grandson?

1553
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:00,450
I don't know.

1554
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:05,399
Where's my grandson?

1555
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:07,170
Go to hell.

1556
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:12,764
That's where you're going,
you son of a bitch!

1557
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:24,289
You're not so tough without
your car, are you?

1558
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,406
Mr. Kimble, are you all right?

1559
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:26,162
Oh, I hate this.

1560
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:33,359
Nah, he doesn't want to eat that.

1561
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:34,879
He's a tough guy.

1562
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:37,039
Tough guys don't eat Jell-O.

1563
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:38,199
I'll come back later.

1564
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:39,279
Hi.

1565
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:40,970
Hi. How you feeling?

1566
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:42,839
Much better.

1567
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:44,359
How about you?

1568
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:45,719
I'll live.

1569
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,919
Check out of here.
This stuff will kill you.

1570
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,039
Just don't throw up on me.

1571
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:54,928
I'm not going to throw up on
you, but I am going to kiss you.

1572
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,599
Phoebe.

1573
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,211
Thanks.

1574
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:03,083
Thanks, partner.

1575
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:05,359
Sure.

1576
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:06,839
How's everybody feeling today?

1577
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:09,079
I brought goodies. Did I do that?

1578
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:10,884
Give me the flowers.

1579
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:13,439
I got some goodies and...

1580
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:14,919
I got it caught.

1581
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:17,559
And something I cooked myself.

1582
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:21,319
I almost didn't recognize you
with all your clothes on.

1583
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:23,010
You look good yourself.

1584
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:26,919
Did I... I'm sorry.

1585
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:28,279
The wedding.

1586
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:29,919
Yeah. Uh...

1587
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,122
You're coming to the
wedding, right?

1588
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:34,890
Is it safe?

1589
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:39,241
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

1590
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,401
So...

1591
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,363
Where do we send the invitation?

1592
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,244
Hmm?

1593
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:22,362
They're all yours.

1594
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,759
Hi, kids.

1595
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:38,359
Mr. Kimble!

1596
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:39,839
I'm back.

1597
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:46,159
Didn't join the union until...

1598
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:53,839
Class, excuse me.

1599
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:23,250
Uh-oh. They're going to do it.
