1
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,718
Doug?

2
00:04:18,928 --> 00:04:21,431
Honey, are you all right?

3
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:24,934
You're dreaming.

4
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:29,314
Was it about Mars?

5
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:36,821
Is that better?

6
00:04:39,532 --> 00:04:41,201
My poor baby.

7
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:44,704
This is getting to be
an obsession.

8
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,172
Was she there?

9
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:57,634
Who?

10
00:04:59,678 --> 00:05:02,514
The one you told me about.
The brunette.

11
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:04,975
Lori.

12
00:05:07,894 --> 00:05:10,855
I can't believe
you're jealous of a dream.

13
00:05:11,564 --> 00:05:14,442
- Who is she?
- Nobody.

14
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:16,736
"Nobody"? What's her name?

15
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,238
I don't know.

16
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:21,324
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

17
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,702
You better tell me!

18
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:27,539
It's not funny, Doug.
You dream about her every night.

19
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:30,333
And I'm always back
in the morning.

20
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:31,835
Let me go!

21
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,506
Come on, baby.

22
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:39,592
You know you're the girl
of my dreams.

23
00:05:39,676 --> 00:05:41,344
You mean it?

24
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,389
You know I do.

25
00:05:53,857 --> 00:05:56,776
I'll give you
something to dream about.

26
00:06:06,745 --> 00:06:06,911
The chairman defended the attack,
saying that space-based weapons...

27
00:06:06,911 --> 00:06:10,498
The chairman defended the attack,
saying that space-based weapons...

28
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:14,669
are our only defense against the
southern block's numerical superiority.

29
00:06:14,753 --> 00:06:17,172
And more violence
last night on Mars...

30
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:19,591
where terrorists
demanding independence...

31
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:23,094
once again halted the extraction
of terbinium ore.

32
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:30,268
Kuato and his so-called
freedom brigade...

33
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:32,395
claimed credit
for this latest bombing,

34
00:06:32,437 --> 00:06:35,732
which attempted to reopen
the sealed-off Pyramid Mines.

35
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:42,697
Mars military restored order
with minimal use of force...

36
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:46,576
and all damage to the strategic facility
was repaired within hours.

37
00:06:46,618 --> 00:06:48,119
No cameras!

38
00:06:48,203 --> 00:06:52,290
With one mine already closed,
Mars administrator Vilos Cohaagen...

39
00:06:52,374 --> 00:06:54,459
vowed that troops
would be used if necessary...

40
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:58,380
to keep production
at full capacity.

41
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:01,883
No wonder you're having nightmares.
You're always watching the news.

42
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:08,473
- Lori.
- Doug?

43
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:11,893
- Let's do it.
- Do what?

44
00:07:11,977 --> 00:07:13,395
Move to Mars.

45
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,899
Why do you have to spoil
a perfectly wonderful morning?

46
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:20,986
Just think about it.

47
00:07:23,363 --> 00:07:26,741
We've been through this before.
You'd hate it on Mars.

48
00:07:26,825 --> 00:07:29,661
It's dry, it's ugly, it's boring.

49
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:34,833
I mean, really, a revolution
could break out there any second.

50
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,835
Cohaagen says
it's just a few extremists.

51
00:07:38,086 --> 00:07:39,504
You believe him?

52
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,804
Okay. Forget about it.

53
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,186
Absolutely not. Mars was colonized by
the northern block at enormous expense.

54
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,982
Our entire war effort
depends on their terbinium.

55
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:00,984
It's absurd to think
we'd give it away...

56
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:03,653
just because some lazy mutants
think they own the planet.

57
00:08:05,322 --> 00:08:08,283
- Maybe we should take a trip.
- Any comment on the rumor...

58
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:11,286
- Lori, move.
- that you've closed the Pyramid Mine...

59
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:13,288
because you found
alien artifacts inside?

60
00:08:13,371 --> 00:08:16,374
There's a lot better places
than Mars.

61
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:19,377
What about Saturn?
Don't you wanna see Saturn?

62
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:23,423
I wish we could find some artifacts.
Our tourist industry could use a boost.

63
00:08:23,506 --> 00:08:26,051
Everybody says that its gorgeous.

64
00:08:26,134 --> 00:08:29,846
The fact is, it's Mr. Kuato and his
terrorists who spread these rumors...

65
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:32,015
to undermine trust
in the government.

66
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:35,727
We could take a long space cruise,
the kind with nothing to do.

67
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,481
- Have you found Kuato yet?
- We don't even know what he looks like.

68
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:41,691
- What do you say?
- That's the news.

69
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:43,693
- Stay tuned for weather.
- I'm late.

70
00:08:43,735 --> 00:08:45,320
But first, this.

71
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,699
- Tonight, World Series Game Five...
- Sweetheart.

72
00:08:49,783 --> 00:08:51,201
Iive from Tokyo.

73
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,999
I know it's hard being in a new town,
but let's give it a chance, okay?

74
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:04,923
Don't you understand? I feel like
I was made for something more than this.

75
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:09,761
I want to do something with my life,
to be somebody.

76
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:11,805
You are somebody.

77
00:09:11,888 --> 00:09:14,015
You're the man I love.

78
00:09:18,603 --> 00:09:20,063
Bye.

79
00:09:22,607 --> 00:09:24,526
Have a nice day.

80
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:46,339
You are now entering
a safety zone.

81
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:50,802
No unauthorized weapons allowed
beyond this point.

82
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:04,149
Would you like to ski...

83
00:10:04,232 --> 00:10:06,693
but you're snowed under
with work?

84
00:10:06,735 --> 00:10:10,780
Do you dream of a vacation
at the bottom of the ocean...

85
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:12,782
but you can't float the bill?

86
00:10:13,658 --> 00:10:17,120
Have you always wanted
to climb the mountains of Mars...

87
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:20,749
but now you're over the hill?

88
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,002
Then come to Rekall lncorporated...

89
00:10:24,044 --> 00:10:27,130
where you can buy the memory
of your ideal vacation...

90
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:29,841
cheaper, safer and better
than the real thing.

91
00:10:29,924 --> 00:10:32,677
So don't let life pass you by.

92
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:36,348
Call Rekall
for the memory of a lifetime.

93
00:10:36,431 --> 00:10:40,352
For the memory of a lifetime

94
00:10:40,393 --> 00:10:43,813
Rekall, Rekall, Rekall

95
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:03,708
Harry.

96
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:09,506
- You ever hear of Rekall?
- Rekall?

97
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:11,508
Where they sell
those fake memories.

98
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:13,051
Oh, Rekall.

99
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,847
- Thinking of going there?
- Maybe.

100
00:11:17,931 --> 00:11:19,891
- Well, don't.
- Why not?

101
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:24,479
A friend of mine tried it,
nearly got himself lobotomized.

102
00:11:25,146 --> 00:11:26,398
No shit?

103
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:29,234
Don't fuck with your brain.
It ain't worth it.

104
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:32,988
I guess not.

105
00:12:17,324 --> 00:12:19,743
Good afternoon.
Welcome to Rekall.

106
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:21,911
Douglas Quaid.
I have an appointment.

107
00:12:25,332 --> 00:12:26,791
- Bob?
- Yeah?

108
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,919
- Doug Quaid is here to see you.
- I'll be right out.

109
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:32,797
Just one minute, Mr. Quaid.

110
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:35,425
Thank you.

111
00:12:44,017 --> 00:12:46,603
- Paul McClane. Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.

112
00:12:46,645 --> 00:12:48,313
Come on in.

113
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:52,150
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.

114
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:54,944
Help me out here, Doug.

115
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:57,781
- You were interested in a memory of--
- Mars.

116
00:12:58,823 --> 00:13:00,492
Yeah. Mars.

117
00:13:00,575 --> 00:13:01,993
Is there a problem?

118
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:05,664
To be perfectly honest...

119
00:13:05,747 --> 00:13:07,290
if you like outer space...

120
00:13:07,374 --> 00:13:11,920
you'd be happier with
one of our Saturn cruises.

121
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:14,839
I'm not interested in Saturn.
I said Mars.

122
00:13:15,674 --> 00:13:17,384
Okay. You're the boss.

123
00:13:18,468 --> 00:13:20,512
Mars it is.

124
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:22,889
Now, let me see.

125
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:25,016
The basic Mars package...

126
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,436
will run you 899 credits.

127
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,982
Now, that's for two full weeks
of memories, complete in every detail.

128
00:13:32,023 --> 00:13:35,527
A longer trip is more expensive
because it's a deeper implant.

129
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,029
What's in the two-week package?

130
00:13:38,113 --> 00:13:41,658
When you go Rekall, you get nothing
but first-class memories.

131
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:46,830
Private shuttle cabin, deluxe suite
at the Hilton, all the major sights:

132
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:49,207
Mount Pyramid,
the Grand Canals...

133
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:51,793
and, of course, Venusville.

134
00:13:51,876 --> 00:13:53,712
But how real does it seem?

135
00:13:53,753 --> 00:13:58,008
- As real as any memory in your head.
- Don't bullshit me.

136
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:01,011
I'm telling you, your brain
will not know the difference.

137
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:03,138
That's guaranteed
or your money back.

138
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:06,558
What about the guy you lobotomized?
Did he get a refund?

139
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:12,230
You're talking ancient history.

140
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:16,318
Nowadays traveling with Rekall
is safer than getting on a rocket.

141
00:14:16,401 --> 00:14:18,320
Check out those statistics.

142
00:14:18,403 --> 00:14:22,073
Besides, a real holiday
is a pain in the butt.

143
00:14:22,157 --> 00:14:24,826
You got lost luggage,
lousy weather...

144
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:26,870
crooked taxi drivers.

145
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:29,164
When you travel with Rekall...

146
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:32,250
everything is perfect.

147
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:33,418
What do you say?

148
00:14:35,587 --> 00:14:38,423
- All right.
- Smart move.

149
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:41,801
While you fill out
this questionnaire,

150
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:44,387
I'll familiarize you
with some of our options.

151
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:45,930
No options.

152
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,518
Whatever you say.
Let me ask you one question.

153
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:53,396
What is exactly the same...

154
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:56,608
about every single vacation
you have ever taken?

155
00:14:57,817 --> 00:14:58,943
I give up.

156
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:01,780
You. You're the same.

157
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:04,407
No matter where you go,
it's always you.

158
00:15:05,283 --> 00:15:07,827
Let me suggest
that you take a vacation...

159
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:09,287
from yourself.

160
00:15:09,371 --> 00:15:10,956
I know, it sounds wild.

161
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,959
It is the latest thing in travel.
We call it the Ego Trip.

162
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:16,211
I'm not interested.

163
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:18,088
You're gonna love this, Doug.

164
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:21,841
We offer you a choice of
alternate identities during your trip.

165
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:25,470
Why go to Mars as a tourist
when you can go as a playboy...

166
00:15:25,553 --> 00:15:27,430
or a famous jock or--

167
00:15:27,514 --> 00:15:28,598
"Secret agent."

168
00:15:28,682 --> 00:15:30,433
How much is that?

169
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,897
Let me tantalize you.

170
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:40,777
You are a top operative under deep cover
on your most important mission.

171
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:43,446
People are trying to kill you.

172
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:46,783
You meet this beautiful,
exotic woman.

173
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:47,951
Go on.

174
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:50,662
I don't wanna spoil it for you...

175
00:15:50,745 --> 00:15:52,956
but by the time
the trip is over...

176
00:15:52,998 --> 00:15:57,002
you get the girl, kill the bad guys
and save the entire planet.

177
00:15:57,085 --> 00:15:58,586
Now, you tell me.

178
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,589
Isn't that worth
a measly 300 credits?

179
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:17,230
Your first trip?

180
00:16:18,523 --> 00:16:21,484
Don't worry. Things hardly ever
fuck up around here.

181
00:16:22,694 --> 00:16:24,696
Good evening... Doug.

182
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:27,157
- I'm Dr. Lull.
- Nice to meet you.

183
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,994
Ernie, patch in matrix 62-B-37.

184
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:34,039
Would you like us to integrate
some alien stuff?

185
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,041
Sure. Why not?

186
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:39,044
Two-headed monsters?

187
00:16:39,127 --> 00:16:41,046
Don't you watch the news?

188
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:44,674
- We're doing alien artifacts now.
- It's wild.

189
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:47,677
Yeah, they date back
a million years.

190
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,722
- Ernie?
- That's a new one.

191
00:16:50,764 --> 00:16:52,557
- Blue sky on Mars.
- Been married long?

192
00:16:53,642 --> 00:16:56,102
- Eight years.
- Oh, I see.

193
00:16:56,186 --> 00:16:58,688
Slipping away for
a little hanky-panky.

194
00:16:58,772 --> 00:17:01,524
- No. I'm fascinated with Mars.
- All systems go.

195
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:03,526
Number seven.

196
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:05,028
Ready for dreamland?

197
00:17:07,614 --> 00:17:11,743
I'll be asking you some questions
so we can fine-tune the Ego program.

198
00:17:11,826 --> 00:17:14,746
You answer honestly,
you'll enjoy yourself much more.

199
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,707
- Your sexual orientation.
- Hetero.

200
00:17:23,171 --> 00:17:25,173
How do you like your women?

201
00:17:25,256 --> 00:17:28,218
Blonde? Brunette? Redhead?

202
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:30,345
Brunette.

203
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:36,559
Slim. Athletic. Voluptuous.

204
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,439
Athletic.

205
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:49,614
Demure. Aggressive. Sleazy.

206
00:17:49,698 --> 00:17:51,241
Be honest.

207
00:17:51,324 --> 00:17:52,742
Sleazy.

208
00:17:57,122 --> 00:17:58,373
Demure.

209
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:02,460
41A, Ernie.

210
00:18:04,337 --> 00:18:06,423
Boy, is he gonna have
a wild time.

211
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:10,969
- He's not gonna want to come back.
- That's for sure.

212
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:33,283
So...

213
00:18:33,366 --> 00:18:35,285
what do you say?

214
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:38,288
I'm not so sure,
and I don't get a souvenir.

215
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,752
Not true. We supply T-shirts,
snapshots of you at the site...

216
00:18:43,835 --> 00:18:45,754
and even letters from--

217
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,301
- What is it?
- Get down here.

218
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:53,678
I am with
a very important client.

219
00:18:53,762 --> 00:18:56,181
Looks like we got
another schizoid embolism.

220
00:18:57,891 --> 00:18:59,517
I'll be right back.

221
00:18:59,601 --> 00:19:00,685
Mr. McClane?

222
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:04,189
Bob! What's wrong?

223
00:19:04,272 --> 00:19:06,191
Don't let her leave!

224
00:19:10,904 --> 00:19:12,697
Get off!

225
00:19:14,574 --> 00:19:16,326
You blew my cover!

226
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:19,621
You can't do a simple
goddamn double implant?

227
00:19:19,704 --> 00:19:21,373
We hit a memory cap.

228
00:19:21,414 --> 00:19:23,750
They're coming!
They'll kill you all!

229
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:26,544
- What is he talking about?
- Let me go!

230
00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:28,546
Mr. Quaid, try to calm down!

231
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:32,968
My name is not Quaid.

232
00:19:33,051 --> 00:19:36,888
- Let me go! Untie me now!
- Ernie, grab his leg!

233
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:39,474
- Hold him down!
- Let me go!

234
00:20:03,206 --> 00:20:05,458
Are you all right?

235
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:08,670
Listen to me.
He's been going on and on about Mars.

236
00:20:08,753 --> 00:20:11,673
- He has really been there.
- Use your head.

237
00:20:11,756 --> 00:20:15,051
He's just acting out the "secret agent"
portion of his ego trip.

238
00:20:15,093 --> 00:20:17,053
- That's not possible.
- Why not?

239
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:18,930
We haven't implanted it yet.

240
00:20:23,143 --> 00:20:24,394
Oh, shit.

241
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:29,607
I've been trying to tell you,
someone has erased his memory.

242
00:20:29,691 --> 00:20:30,942
Excuse me.

243
00:20:31,026 --> 00:20:32,777
"Someone"?

244
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:34,779
We're talking about the Agency.

245
00:20:34,863 --> 00:20:37,574
- Shut up!
- Bob, the client's gone.

246
00:20:40,035 --> 00:20:43,622
Renata, cover up any memory he's got
of us or Rekall.

247
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:45,915
I'll try.
It's pretty messy in there.

248
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:49,252
Ernie, dump him in a cab.
Tiffany, you help him.

249
00:20:49,294 --> 00:20:52,297
I'm gonna destroy his file
and refund his money.

250
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,717
And if anybody comes asking,
we never heard of Douglas Quaid.

251
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:11,566
Where am l?

252
00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:15,820
You're in a Johnnycab.

253
00:21:15,904 --> 00:21:17,489
What am I doing here?

254
00:21:17,572 --> 00:21:21,076
I'm sorry. Would you please
rephrase the question?

255
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:23,203
How did I get in this taxi?

256
00:21:23,286 --> 00:21:25,830
The door opened, you got in.

257
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,543
Hell of a day, isn't it?

258
00:21:44,224 --> 00:21:46,184
- This okay?
- Right here.

259
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:48,937
- Thank you for taking Johnnycab.
- Thank you.

260
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,481
Hope you enjoyed the ride.

261
00:21:51,564 --> 00:21:53,024
Hey, Quaid.

262
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:56,528
- Harry.
- How was your trip to Mars?

263
00:21:56,569 --> 00:21:59,656
- What trip?
- You went to Rekall. Remember?

264
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,951
- I did?
- Yeah, you did.

265
00:22:03,034 --> 00:22:06,496
- I told you not to, but you went.
- What are you, my father?

266
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:11,293
- Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
- Thank you. I'm already late--

267
00:22:13,211 --> 00:22:16,172
Okay, bring him--
Come on, move it!

268
00:22:16,256 --> 00:22:18,508
Let's go get that drink.
Move it!

269
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,012
What is going on?
What the fuck did I do wrong?

270
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:25,181
- Tell me!
- You blabbed about Mars!

271
00:22:25,223 --> 00:22:28,476
Are you crazy? I don't even know
anything about Mars!

272
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,022
You should've listened to me, Quaid.
I was there to keep you out of trouble.

273
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:39,070
You're making a big mistake.
You got me mixed up with somebody else.

274
00:22:39,112 --> 00:22:41,573
You got yourself mixed up with--

275
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:34,584
And pivot... and serve...

276
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:37,128
and shift... and stroke...

277
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:44,594
Very good.
Perfect form.

278
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:49,557
Hi, honey.

279
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:54,813
- What are you doing?
- Some men just tried to kill me.

280
00:23:54,896 --> 00:23:56,481
Muggers?
Are you all right?

281
00:23:56,564 --> 00:23:58,608
No, they were spies or something.

282
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,403
Harry, from work, he was the--
Get down!

283
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:05,448
- Harry was the boss.
- Take it easy, Doug, okay?

284
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:09,452
- Why would spies want to kill you?
- I don't know.

285
00:24:09,494 --> 00:24:12,956
- It had something to do with Mars.
- You've never been to Mars.

286
00:24:12,998 --> 00:24:16,334
It sounds crazy, but I went to
this Rekall place after work--

287
00:24:16,418 --> 00:24:18,837
- Those brain butchers?
- Let me finish.

288
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,133
- What did they do to you?
- I got a trip to Mars.

289
00:24:23,174 --> 00:24:26,636
Forget about Rekall.
They were going to kill me.

290
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:29,681
- Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
- They did.

291
00:24:29,764 --> 00:24:31,808
But I killed them.

292
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:38,315
Listen, sweetheart. Those assholes
at Rekall have fucked up your mind.

293
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:40,692
You're having paranoid delusions.

294
00:24:40,775 --> 00:24:43,194
You call this a delusion?

295
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,957
- Doug, I'm gonna call a doctor.
- Don't. Don't call anybody.

296
00:25:24,235 --> 00:25:26,696
Lori, go! Get out!

297
00:26:17,998 --> 00:26:19,457
Why are you doing this?

298
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:37,517
Talk!

299
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,686
- I'm not your wife.
- The hell you're not.

300
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:41,771
I never saw you
before six weeks ago.

301
00:26:41,813 --> 00:26:44,441
Our marriage
is just a memory implant.

302
00:26:44,524 --> 00:26:47,319
You think I'm stupid?
I remember our wedding.

303
00:26:47,402 --> 00:26:48,820
It was an Agency implant.

304
00:26:48,903 --> 00:26:50,488
- Falling in love.
- Implanted.

305
00:26:50,572 --> 00:26:54,451
Our friends, my job, 8 years together.
All of this was implanted?

306
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:57,454
The job's real.
The Agency set it up.

307
00:26:57,495 --> 00:26:58,955
Bullshit.

308
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,252
They erased your identity
and implanted a new one.

309
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:08,548
I was written in as your wife
so I could make sure the erasure took.

310
00:27:14,387 --> 00:27:15,513
Sorry, Quaid.

311
00:27:15,555 --> 00:27:17,766
Your whole life
is just a dream.

312
00:27:20,477 --> 00:27:24,773
Okay, then if I'm not me,
who the hell am l?

313
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:25,982
Beats me.

314
00:27:27,317 --> 00:27:29,235
I just work here.

315
00:27:37,744 --> 00:27:40,121
There's something
I want you to know.

316
00:27:41,706 --> 00:27:45,794
You were the best assignment
I ever had. Really.

317
00:27:45,877 --> 00:27:47,504
I'm honored.

318
00:27:47,545 --> 00:27:51,508
You sure you don't want to,
just for old times' sake?

319
00:27:52,676 --> 00:27:55,804
If you don't trust me,
you can tie me up.

320
00:27:57,681 --> 00:28:01,643
- I didn't know you were so kinky.
- Maybe it's time you found out.

321
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:08,191
Clever girl.

322
00:28:10,735 --> 00:28:14,656
You wouldn't shoot me, Doug,
after all we've been through.

323
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,659
Some of it was fun.

324
00:28:20,578 --> 00:28:22,205
Nice knowing you.

325
00:28:56,948 --> 00:28:58,074
Don't touch her.

326
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:00,243
Nobody here.

327
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,373
- Are you okay?
- I guess I blew it.

328
00:29:05,457 --> 00:29:08,084
- What does he remember?
- Nothing, so far.

329
00:29:08,168 --> 00:29:09,753
I've got him.

330
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:25,935
He's going for the subway.
Let's go.

331
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:27,979
Let's go. Move it.

332
00:29:41,242 --> 00:29:44,204
Pack your stuff
and get outta here.

333
00:29:44,245 --> 00:29:46,164
What if they bring him back?

334
00:29:47,248 --> 00:29:48,667
Not a chance.

335
00:29:57,676 --> 00:29:59,135
Subway! Go!

336
00:30:09,813 --> 00:30:12,190
Get him!
He's got a gun!

337
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:15,986
- Cut him off! That way!
- Over there!

338
00:30:16,069 --> 00:30:17,362
Hold it!

339
00:30:49,394 --> 00:30:50,478
The escalator.

340
00:30:50,562 --> 00:30:52,981
You four go up.
You come with me.

341
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:09,539
Get out of the way!

342
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,710
Move!

343
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:45,742
The platform!

344
00:31:49,537 --> 00:31:51,456
- Which way?
- To the right.

345
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:22,237
Botco.
Tomorrow's fuels, tomorrow's prices.

346
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:25,991
Don't settle for pale memories
or fake implants.

347
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:28,535
Experience space travel
the old-fashioned way...

348
00:32:28,618 --> 00:32:31,913
on a real, live holiday
you can afford.

349
00:32:37,961 --> 00:32:39,879
I want that fucker dead.

350
00:32:39,963 --> 00:32:43,174
I don't blame you. I wouldn't want
Quaid porking my old lady.

351
00:32:43,258 --> 00:32:48,179
- You saying she likes it?
- No, I'm sure she hated every minute.

352
00:32:48,972 --> 00:32:53,268
Six-beta-nine, we have a live
transmission from Mr. Cohaagen.

353
00:32:54,352 --> 00:32:57,022
- Richter here.
- Patch it through.

354
00:32:57,105 --> 00:33:00,650
- What is going on?
- I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.

355
00:33:00,734 --> 00:33:03,361
I want him alive, you moron.

356
00:33:03,445 --> 00:33:05,655
No. He knows too much.

357
00:33:07,198 --> 00:33:09,200
Lori says
he can't remember anything.

358
00:33:09,284 --> 00:33:11,828
In an hour
he could have total recall.

359
00:33:11,911 --> 00:33:16,541
Listen to me, Richter. I want Quaid
delivered alive for reimplantation.

360
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,168
Have you got that?

361
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:21,296
I want him back in place
with Lori.

362
00:33:22,422 --> 00:33:23,882
Did you hear me?

363
00:33:24,924 --> 00:33:27,510
What was that, sir?
I couldn't hear you.

364
00:33:27,594 --> 00:33:29,638
I got Quaid again.

365
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:32,932
Switching to another channel.
I've got sunspots.

366
00:33:34,893 --> 00:33:37,062
- Call him back!
- I'm losing you.

367
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:40,023
- Where is he?
- Second level, galleria.

368
00:33:40,106 --> 00:33:42,484
We should've killed Quaid
on Mars.

369
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,094
- How we doing?
- Fine.

370
00:34:12,055 --> 00:34:13,848
Zooming in.

371
00:34:13,932 --> 00:34:15,016
We got him!

372
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:38,415
If you want to live,
don't hang up.

373
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:40,417
- What do you want?
- You've been bugged.

374
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:44,796
They'll be there in three minutes
unless you do as I say.

375
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,799
Don't bother searching.
The bug's in your skull.

376
00:34:50,844 --> 00:34:52,762
- Who are you?
- Never mind.

377
00:34:52,804 --> 00:34:55,849
Wrap a wet towel around your head.
That'll muffle the signal.

378
00:34:55,932 --> 00:34:58,852
- How'd you find me?
- I'd advise you to hurry.

379
00:35:01,604 --> 00:35:05,025
This'll buy you some time.
They won't be able to pinpoint you.

380
00:35:13,617 --> 00:35:15,285
- Shit!
- What?

381
00:35:15,368 --> 00:35:17,871
- I lost him.
- Well, find him!

382
00:35:17,954 --> 00:35:19,497
Yeah, right.

383
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:21,499
Hurry up.
You look beautiful.

384
00:35:24,461 --> 00:35:27,672
Now go to the window.
Go.

385
00:35:30,634 --> 00:35:32,844
Can you see me down here?

386
00:35:32,886 --> 00:35:36,181
- This is the suitcase you gave me.
- I gave you?

387
00:35:36,222 --> 00:35:39,684
I'm gonna set it here.
Come and get it, keep moving.

388
00:35:39,768 --> 00:35:41,811
- Wait. Wait.
- What?

389
00:35:41,895 --> 00:35:45,440
- Who are you?
- We were buddies in the Agency on Mars.

390
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:48,985
You asked me, if you disappeared,
to find you, so here I am.

391
00:35:49,069 --> 00:35:51,529
What was I doing on Mars?

392
00:35:55,909 --> 00:35:57,953
Excuse me, but this is mine.

393
00:35:58,036 --> 00:36:01,206
- I don't see your name on it.
- Someone left it for me.

394
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:04,125
- Find your own bag.
- I need it!

395
00:36:05,335 --> 00:36:07,128
Fuck you, you asshole!

396
00:36:16,638 --> 00:36:18,556
He's gotta be around here
somewhere.

397
00:36:22,435 --> 00:36:23,561
That guy there.

398
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:36,992
Hello, I'm Johnnycab.
Where can I take you tonight?

399
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,704
Drive. Drive!

400
00:36:40,787 --> 00:36:44,082
- Please repeat the destination.
- Anywhere! Just go! Go!

401
00:36:44,124 --> 00:36:46,084
Please state the street
and number.

402
00:36:46,126 --> 00:36:48,253
Shit. Shit!

403
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:52,048
I'm not familiar with that address.
Would you please repeat--

404
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:01,224
Fasten your seat belt!

405
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:36,760
The fare is 18 credits, please.

406
00:37:36,843 --> 00:37:38,303
Sue me, dickhead.

407
00:37:48,313 --> 00:37:50,774
We hope you enjoyed the ride.

408
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:28,246
Howdy, stranger.
This is Hauser.

409
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,666
If things have gone wrong,
I'm talking to myself...

410
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,836
and you've got a wet towel
wrapped around your head.

411
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:38,381
Whatever your name is,
get ready for the big surprise.

412
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:42,927
You are not you.
You are me.

413
00:39:43,762 --> 00:39:45,597
No shit.

414
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:50,101
Six-beta-nine,
six-beta-nine, come in.

415
00:39:50,185 --> 00:39:51,603
Did you find him?

416
00:39:51,645 --> 00:39:54,606
We picked up an explosion
at the old cement factory.

417
00:39:55,482 --> 00:39:58,276
Send two units.
We'll meet you there.

418
00:40:02,656 --> 00:40:05,575
All my life I've worked
for Mars intelligence.

419
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:07,744
I did Cohaagen's dirty work.

420
00:40:07,827 --> 00:40:10,747
But recently I met somebody--
a woman--

421
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,749
and I learned a few things.

422
00:40:12,832 --> 00:40:15,627
I've been playing
for the wrong team.

423
00:40:16,795 --> 00:40:20,674
All I can do now is try
to make up for it.

424
00:40:20,715 --> 00:40:24,052
There's enough shit in here
to fuck Cohaagen good.

425
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:28,348
But if you're listening to this,
that means he has got to me first.

426
00:40:29,182 --> 00:40:31,101
Here comes the hard part.

427
00:40:31,184 --> 00:40:33,353
Now it is all up to you.

428
00:40:33,436 --> 00:40:34,688
Great.

429
00:40:46,408 --> 00:40:48,410
- What have we got?
- Nothing here.

430
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:50,912
- He's gone.
- I got a weak signal over there.

431
00:40:50,996 --> 00:40:52,455
Find him.

432
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:55,458
First let's get rid
of that bug in your head.

433
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:59,337
Take this thing out of the case
and stick it up your nose.

434
00:40:59,379 --> 00:41:01,423
Don't worry.
It's self-guiding.

435
00:41:07,387 --> 00:41:09,514
Just shove real hard.

436
00:41:15,395 --> 00:41:17,188
When it crunches, you're there.

437
00:41:18,773 --> 00:41:20,525
Just pull it out.

438
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:23,028
Be careful.
It's my head too.

439
00:41:44,841 --> 00:41:46,760
I've got a lock.

440
00:41:46,843 --> 00:41:48,261
Up. Let's go.

441
00:41:50,472 --> 00:41:52,182
This is the plan.

442
00:41:52,265 --> 00:41:53,892
Get your ass to Mars...

443
00:41:53,975 --> 00:41:57,354
go to the Hilton and flash
the Brubaker I.D. at the desk.

444
00:41:57,437 --> 00:41:59,189
That's it.

445
00:41:59,272 --> 00:42:05,111
Just do what I say and we can nail
that bastard who fucked you and me.

446
00:42:05,153 --> 00:42:07,238
I'm counting on you, Buddy.

447
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,032
Don't let me down.

448
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:39,104
Straight ahead.

449
00:42:43,108 --> 00:42:44,526
In there.

450
00:42:52,993 --> 00:42:54,452
There!

451
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:13,596
Give me that.

452
00:43:19,185 --> 00:43:20,312
Shit.

453
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:24,941
Get your ass to Mars--
Get your ass to Mars--

454
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,978
Welcome to the Mars
Federal Colony.

455
00:44:02,062 --> 00:44:04,981
For your safety and comfort,
domes have been installed...

456
00:44:05,065 --> 00:44:07,192
to protect you
from the vacuum outside.

457
00:44:07,275 --> 00:44:10,862
Please do not touch
exterior windows or air locks.

458
00:44:10,946 --> 00:44:15,241
Air volume is limited. No smoking
is allowed anywhere in the colony.

459
00:44:15,283 --> 00:44:16,368
Next.

460
00:44:17,577 --> 00:44:20,664
Thank you,
and enjoy your stay on Mars.

461
00:44:20,747 --> 00:44:22,165
Passport.

462
00:44:35,303 --> 00:44:37,263
- Get out of the way.
- Make way!

463
00:44:37,347 --> 00:44:39,182
Stand back.

464
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:47,857
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you
right away.

465
00:44:48,942 --> 00:44:50,568
Any news of Quaid?

466
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:53,571
- Not since you lost him.
- Watch your mouth, Captain.

467
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:58,410
- How long do you plan to stay?
- Two weeks.

468
00:44:58,493 --> 00:45:00,704
Look at that shit.

469
00:45:00,787 --> 00:45:04,332
- What the hell's this?
- The Martians love Kuato.

470
00:45:04,416 --> 00:45:06,584
They think
he's fuckin' George Washington.

471
00:45:06,668 --> 00:45:08,420
Kill the bastard.

472
00:45:08,461 --> 00:45:10,255
Nobody knows who he is.

473
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,217
Have you brought
any fruits or vegetables?

474
00:45:14,843 --> 00:45:16,219
Two weeks.

475
00:45:17,053 --> 00:45:18,138
Excuse me?

476
00:45:19,597 --> 00:45:21,516
Two weeks.

477
00:45:28,523 --> 00:45:30,775
It's not just graffiti. The rebels
took over the refinery last night.

478
00:45:30,817 --> 00:45:33,320
The rebels took over
the refinery last night.

479
00:45:33,361 --> 00:45:35,071
No terbinium is going out.

480
00:45:35,155 --> 00:45:37,115
And it gets worse.

481
00:45:57,552 --> 00:45:58,928
Quaid.

482
00:46:00,055 --> 00:46:01,514
- That's Quaid!
- Where?

483
00:46:01,598 --> 00:46:03,475
The woman!
Get him-- her!

484
00:46:04,392 --> 00:46:06,102
Arrest that woman!

485
00:46:06,186 --> 00:46:07,646
Grab her!

486
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,510
Catch!

487
00:46:40,595 --> 00:46:42,847
Get ready for a surprise!

488
00:47:53,668 --> 00:47:55,629
- Open the goddamn door!
- I can't!

489
00:47:55,712 --> 00:47:57,088
Open it!

490
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:58,882
They're all connected!

491
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:11,811
A few days ago
Cohaagen raised the price of air.

492
00:48:11,853 --> 00:48:15,190
- Again?
- Nobody on Earth cares about Mars.

493
00:48:15,273 --> 00:48:18,193
They just want our terbinium
so they can fight their war.

494
00:48:18,276 --> 00:48:20,236
Excuse me. What's that?

495
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,447
You mean the Pyramid Mine?

496
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:26,076
I used to work there until
they found that alien shit inside.

497
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:28,620
Well, that's a rumor,
isn't it?

498
00:48:28,662 --> 00:48:30,163
Think so?

499
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:01,152
Mr. Cohaagen.

500
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,370
You wanted to see me, sir?

501
00:49:13,957 --> 00:49:15,375
Richter...

502
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:18,837
do you know why I'm so happy?

503
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,380
No, sir.

504
00:49:22,215 --> 00:49:25,677
Because I've got the greatest job
in the solar system.

505
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,848
As long as the terbinium keeps flowing,
I can do anything I want.

506
00:49:29,931 --> 00:49:31,391
Anything.

507
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:34,519
In fact...

508
00:49:34,561 --> 00:49:37,856
my only worry
is that one day...

509
00:49:37,897 --> 00:49:40,191
if the rebels win...

510
00:49:40,233 --> 00:49:42,819
it all might end...

511
00:49:42,902 --> 00:49:44,487
and you're making it happen!

512
00:49:45,405 --> 00:49:48,408
First you try to kill Quaid,
then he escapes.

513
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:50,744
He had help from our side, sir.

514
00:49:51,953 --> 00:49:53,163
I know that.

515
00:49:55,248 --> 00:49:57,584
- But I thought--
- Who told you to think?

516
00:49:57,626 --> 00:50:00,712
I don't give you enough information
to think.

517
00:50:02,255 --> 00:50:05,925
You do what you're told.
That's what you do.

518
00:50:08,094 --> 00:50:09,387
Yes, sir.

519
00:50:14,768 --> 00:50:16,353
Let's get to business.

520
00:50:18,063 --> 00:50:20,440
We've got
a tricky situation here.

521
00:50:20,482 --> 00:50:22,859
Kuato wants
what's in Quaid's head.

522
00:50:24,194 --> 00:50:27,530
He might be able to get it.
They say he's psychic.

523
00:50:28,949 --> 00:50:31,868
I have a plan
to keep this from happening.

524
00:50:35,288 --> 00:50:37,248
Suppose you could play along?

525
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:39,417
- Yes, sir.
- Great.

526
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:41,962
Otherwise, I'll erase your ass.

527
00:51:00,105 --> 00:51:04,234
You need a taxi?
I got magazines, music, whisky.

528
00:51:04,317 --> 00:51:06,736
You need a cab?
Come on!

529
00:51:32,345 --> 00:51:33,805
Can I help you?

530
00:51:33,847 --> 00:51:36,433
I would like a room, please.

531
00:51:41,521 --> 00:51:44,482
Nice to have you back, Mr. Brubaker.
Would you like the same suite?

532
00:51:44,566 --> 00:51:45,942
Definitely.

533
00:51:48,194 --> 00:51:50,280
You've left something in our safe.

534
00:51:50,363 --> 00:51:51,281
Could you get it?

535
00:51:57,579 --> 00:51:59,164
Identification?

536
00:52:08,506 --> 00:52:10,925
- I'll encode your room key.
- Thank you.

537
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,695
- Suite 610 in the east wing.
- Thank you.

538
00:52:30,737 --> 00:52:33,239
- Could I borrow your pen, please?
- Certainly.

539
00:52:45,293 --> 00:52:46,544
Thank you.

540
00:52:51,758 --> 00:52:54,260
Hey, man, you need a cab?

541
00:52:54,344 --> 00:52:58,807
- What's wrong with this one?
- He ain't got five kids to feed.

542
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:01,309
- Where's yours?
- Right over there.

543
00:53:03,645 --> 00:53:06,398
Hey, asshole!
That's my fare!

544
00:53:06,481 --> 00:53:07,857
Eat this!

545
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:09,276
Damn you, Benny!

546
00:53:15,448 --> 00:53:17,075
Welcome to Mars, man!

547
00:53:21,288 --> 00:53:24,874
- What was that, an accident?
- That's the rebels.

548
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:26,418
Let's get outta here...

549
00:53:26,459 --> 00:53:28,378
before they arrest us!

550
00:53:28,461 --> 00:53:30,714
What do the rebels want?

551
00:53:30,755 --> 00:53:33,758
The usual.
More money, more freedom, more air.

552
00:53:38,805 --> 00:53:40,098
So, where to?

553
00:53:40,181 --> 00:53:41,975
Last Resort.

554
00:53:42,017 --> 00:53:44,060
You're getting off
to an early start.

555
00:53:44,978 --> 00:53:47,230
- First time on Mars?
- Yes.

556
00:53:47,314 --> 00:53:49,149
Well, actually, no.

557
00:53:49,232 --> 00:53:50,984
Well, sort of.

558
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:55,071
The man don't even know
whether he's been to Mars or not.

559
00:54:05,457 --> 00:54:07,876
Voila. Venusville.

560
00:54:09,169 --> 00:54:11,463
Hey, you see anything you like?

561
00:54:15,508 --> 00:54:18,845
End of the line.
We'd better walk from here.

562
00:54:18,887 --> 00:54:20,805
I'll show you where.

563
00:54:20,889 --> 00:54:24,643
- Do you want to know the future?
- What about the past?

564
00:54:24,726 --> 00:54:28,480
It's around the corner,
right down this alley.

565
00:54:28,521 --> 00:54:30,482
They got everything.

566
00:54:33,026 --> 00:54:34,986
Not bad, huh?

567
00:54:36,446 --> 00:54:40,325
Read your palm? Your mind? Your aura?
Probe the secrets of your heart?

568
00:54:41,076 --> 00:54:43,161
I bet I can guess
your birthday.

569
00:54:43,244 --> 00:54:46,206
- You're a Taurus, right?
- How did you guess?

570
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:51,169
- Tell me, are all psychics--
- Freaks?

571
00:54:51,252 --> 00:54:53,296
Afraid so.
It goes with the territory.

572
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:58,551
- What happened to them?
- Cheap domes, no air to clean the rays.

573
00:54:58,635 --> 00:55:02,639
This is it. The Last Resort.
You sure you want to go in here?

574
00:55:02,722 --> 00:55:05,850
- Why not?
- There's a better place down there.

575
00:55:05,934 --> 00:55:08,895
The girls are cleaner,
the liquor ain't watered down--

576
00:55:08,937 --> 00:55:11,189
Sure, and you get kickbacks.

577
00:55:11,273 --> 00:55:14,192
Hey, man,
I got five kids to feed.

578
00:55:14,276 --> 00:55:16,194
Take them to the dentist.

579
00:55:16,236 --> 00:55:18,738
Thanks, mister!
I'll be waiting for you.

580
00:55:18,822 --> 00:55:21,199
Take your time.
Benny's the name.

581
00:55:41,094 --> 00:55:43,179
- What do you want?
- Melina.

582
00:55:43,263 --> 00:55:45,015
She's busy.

583
00:55:45,098 --> 00:55:47,183
But Mary here, she's free.

584
00:55:47,225 --> 00:55:50,687
Well, not free, honey, but...

585
00:55:51,396 --> 00:55:52,606
available.

586
00:55:55,775 --> 00:55:58,111
Thanks.
I'll wait for Melina.

587
00:55:58,194 --> 00:55:59,446
Earth slime.

588
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:02,198
Thing is, friend,
Mel's real picky.

589
00:56:02,282 --> 00:56:04,409
She sticks to her regulars.

590
00:56:04,492 --> 00:56:06,453
She'll like me.

591
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:08,955
Mel!

592
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:47,953
Hello, Hauser.

593
00:56:48,995 --> 00:56:50,956
Still bulging, I see.

594
00:56:52,415 --> 00:56:55,669
- What you been feeding this thing?
- Blondes.

595
00:56:57,629 --> 00:56:59,547
I think it's still hungry.

596
00:57:01,925 --> 00:57:04,970
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here, Hauser.

597
00:57:05,053 --> 00:57:07,097
Look who's talking.

598
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,975
Hey, Tony,
give the big guy a break.

599
00:57:10,058 --> 00:57:12,394
Relax. You'll live longer.

600
00:57:12,477 --> 00:57:13,895
Come on.

601
00:57:19,526 --> 00:57:23,154
- Honey, take care of Tony, will you?
- No problem.

602
00:57:23,238 --> 00:57:26,199
If you need any help with this one,
give me a holler.

603
00:57:41,047 --> 00:57:43,133
You son of a bitch.

604
00:57:43,174 --> 00:57:45,802
You're alive? I thought that
Cohaagen tortured you to death.

605
00:57:45,885 --> 00:57:47,721
Well, I guess he didn't.

606
00:57:47,804 --> 00:57:51,641
And you couldn't get me a message? You
never wondered what happened to me?

607
00:57:59,232 --> 00:58:01,526
Hauser, thank God you're alive.

608
00:58:02,652 --> 00:58:04,988
Melin-- Melina.
Melina.

609
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,868
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

610
00:58:09,909 --> 00:58:13,538
- I don't remember you.
- What are you talking about?

611
00:58:13,622 --> 00:58:15,749
I don't remember you.

612
00:58:15,832 --> 00:58:19,294
I don't remember us.
I don't even remember me.

613
00:58:21,379 --> 00:58:23,798
Did you get amnesia?
How did you get here?

614
00:58:23,882 --> 00:58:26,259
- Hauser left me a note.
- You're Hauser.

615
00:58:26,343 --> 00:58:28,261
Not anymore.

616
00:58:28,345 --> 00:58:31,473
Now I'm Quaid.
Douglas Quaid.

617
00:58:34,643 --> 00:58:38,688
- Hauser, you've lost your mind.
- No, Cohaagen stole it.

618
00:58:38,772 --> 00:58:43,360
He found out that Hauser switched sides,
so he turned him into somebody else: me.

619
00:58:43,443 --> 00:58:44,861
This is too weird.

620
00:58:44,945 --> 00:58:47,572
He dumped me on earth
with a wife and a lousy job--

621
00:58:47,614 --> 00:58:50,575
Did you say wife?
Are you fucking married?

622
00:58:50,617 --> 00:58:52,619
- She wasn't really my wife.
- Oh, she isn't?

623
00:58:52,702 --> 00:58:55,330
How stupid of me.
She was Hauser's wife?

624
00:58:55,413 --> 00:58:58,124
- Forget that I said wife.
- Let's just forget everything.

625
00:58:58,166 --> 00:59:01,962
- I'm sick of hearing your goddamn lies.
- Why would I lie to you?

626
00:59:02,963 --> 00:59:06,383
Because you're still
working for Cohaagen.

627
00:59:06,424 --> 00:59:09,052
Don't be ridiculous.

628
00:59:11,638 --> 00:59:13,890
You never loved me, Hauser.

629
00:59:13,974 --> 00:59:15,934
You just used me to get inside.

630
00:59:16,017 --> 00:59:17,936
Inside what?

631
00:59:22,065 --> 00:59:24,109
I think you'd better leave.

632
00:59:24,192 --> 00:59:27,445
-Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
-I'm not falling for it.

633
00:59:27,529 --> 00:59:29,698
He says there's enough in here
to nail Cohaagen for good.

634
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:31,700
- Get out!
- You've got to help me remember!

635
00:59:31,783 --> 00:59:33,910
- I said, get out!
- Melina, please!

636
00:59:33,994 --> 00:59:35,912
People are trying to kill me.

637
00:59:36,788 --> 00:59:38,456
Really?

638
00:59:40,792 --> 00:59:42,877
All right, I'm leaving.

639
00:59:54,889 --> 00:59:57,851
Baby, you make me wish
I had three hands.

640
00:59:57,892 --> 01:00:00,645
I think you're doing
just fine with two.

641
01:00:00,687 --> 01:00:03,106
Excuse me, baby.
We'll pick this up later.

642
01:00:03,189 --> 01:00:05,609
Hey, that didn't take long.

643
01:00:05,692 --> 01:00:08,278
Let me ask you a question.
Did you ever fuck a mutant?

644
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:10,822
- Take me to the hotel.
- I know these Siamese twins.

645
01:00:10,864 --> 01:00:13,491
Man, you won't know
if you're coming or going.

646
01:00:23,251 --> 01:00:23,293
This afternoon at 4:30 p.m., I signed
an order declaring martial law...

647
01:00:23,293 --> 01:00:27,005
This afternoon at 4:30 p.m., I signed
an order declaring martial law...

648
01:00:27,088 --> 01:00:29,424
throughout the Mars federal colony.

649
01:00:29,507 --> 01:00:34,095
I will not tolerate any further damage
to our mineral export operations.

650
01:00:34,179 --> 01:00:36,348
Mr. Kuato and his terrorists
must understand...

651
01:00:36,431 --> 01:00:39,893
that their self-defeating efforts
will only bring misery and suffering--

652
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,731
Mr. Quaid?

653
01:00:45,482 --> 01:00:46,733
What?

654
01:00:46,816 --> 01:00:49,152
I need to talk to you
about Mr. Hauser.

655
01:00:50,362 --> 01:00:52,697
- Who are you?
- Dr. Edgemar from Rekall.

656
01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:55,075
- How did you find me?
- It's difficult to explain.

657
01:00:55,158 --> 01:00:58,036
Could you open the door?
I'm unarmed.

658
01:00:59,746 --> 01:01:02,749
Don't worry. I'm alone.
May I come in?

659
01:01:04,751 --> 01:01:08,088
- What do you want?
- This will be hard for you to accept.

660
01:01:08,171 --> 01:01:11,675
- I'm listening.
- You're not really standing here now.

661
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:16,554
- Doc, you could have fooled me.
- I'm quite serious.

662
01:01:16,596 --> 01:01:19,933
You're not here
and neither am I.

663
01:01:20,016 --> 01:01:21,268
That's amazing.

664
01:01:21,351 --> 01:01:24,437
- Where are we?
- At Rekall.

665
01:01:24,521 --> 01:01:26,439
You're strapped into
an implant chair...

666
01:01:26,523 --> 01:01:29,442
and I'm monitoring you
from the psychoprobe console.

667
01:01:30,485 --> 01:01:33,071
Ah, I get it.
I'm dreaming.

668
01:01:33,113 --> 01:01:36,491
And all this is part of the delightful
vacation your company has sold me.

669
01:01:36,574 --> 01:01:37,993
Not exactly.

670
01:01:38,076 --> 01:01:42,205
What you're experiencing is a free-form
delusion based on our memory tapes...

671
01:01:42,289 --> 01:01:44,874
but you're inventing it
yourself as you go along.

672
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:49,754
If it is my delusion,
who the hell invited you?

673
01:01:49,796 --> 01:01:53,758
I've been artificially implanted
as an emergency measure.

674
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:57,137
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you've suffered a schizoid embolism.

675
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,597
We can't snap you
out of your fantasy...

676
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:02,726
and I've been sent in
to try to talk you down.

677
01:02:02,809 --> 01:02:04,728
How much is Cohaagen
paying you for this?

678
01:02:06,187 --> 01:02:10,317
Think about it. Your dream started
in the middle of the implant procedure.

679
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,819
Everything after that--
the chases, the trip to Mars...

680
01:02:12,902 --> 01:02:17,407
the suite at the Hilton-- are elements
of your Rekall Holiday and Ego Trip.

681
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:19,909
You paid to be a secret agent.

682
01:02:19,993 --> 01:02:22,454
Bullshit. It's coincidence.

683
01:02:22,537 --> 01:02:25,123
And what about the girl?

684
01:02:25,165 --> 01:02:27,959
Brunette, athletic,
sleazy and demure?

685
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:30,587
Just as you specified.
Is that coincidence?

686
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:34,299
She's real. I dreamt about her
before I even went to Rekall.

687
01:02:34,341 --> 01:02:36,426
Mr. Quaid.

688
01:02:36,509 --> 01:02:40,555
Can you hear yourself?
She's real because you dreamed her?

689
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:43,642
- That's right.
- Maybe this will convince you.

690
01:02:43,725 --> 01:02:46,186
Would you mind opening the door?

691
01:02:48,146 --> 01:02:50,523
- You open it.
- No need to be rude.

692
01:02:50,607 --> 01:02:52,442
I'll do it.

693
01:02:59,032 --> 01:03:00,283
Sweetheart?

694
01:03:02,869 --> 01:03:04,913
Come in, Mrs. Quaid.

695
01:03:09,084 --> 01:03:12,045
- I suppose you're not here either.
- I'm here...

696
01:03:12,128 --> 01:03:14,798
at Rekall.

697
01:03:18,551 --> 01:03:20,220
I love you.

698
01:03:20,303 --> 01:03:23,682
Right. That's why
you tried to kill me.

699
01:03:23,723 --> 01:03:27,769
No. I'd never do
anything to hurt you.

700
01:03:27,852 --> 01:03:30,188
I want you to come back to me.

701
01:03:32,315 --> 01:03:35,568
- Bullshit.
- What's bullshit, Mr. Quaid?

702
01:03:35,652 --> 01:03:40,240
That you're having a paranoid episode
triggered by acute neurochemical trauma?

703
01:03:40,323 --> 01:03:44,286
Or that you're really
an invincible secret agent from Mars...

704
01:03:44,369 --> 01:03:48,581
who's the victim of an interplanetary
conspiracy to make him think...

705
01:03:48,665 --> 01:03:50,625
he's a lowly construction worker?

706
01:03:58,216 --> 01:04:00,552
Stop punishing yourself, Doug.

707
01:04:00,593 --> 01:04:03,555
You're a fine, upstanding man.
You have a beautiful wife who loves you.

708
01:04:05,098 --> 01:04:07,058
Your whole life is ahead of you.

709
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:11,688
But you've got to want
to return to reality.

710
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:16,693
Let's assume I do.
Then what?

711
01:04:19,529 --> 01:04:22,616
- Swallow this.
- What is it?

712
01:04:22,699 --> 01:04:26,536
It's a symbol of your desire
to return to reality.

713
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:29,039
Inside your dream,
you'll fall asleep.

714
01:04:32,959 --> 01:04:37,172
All right, let's say you're telling
the truth and this is all a dream.

715
01:04:37,255 --> 01:04:39,924
Then I could pull this trigger
and it won't matter.

716
01:04:40,008 --> 01:04:43,094
- Doug, don't.
- It won't make a difference to me.

717
01:04:43,136 --> 01:04:47,641
But the consequences to you would be
devastating. In your mind I'll be dead.

718
01:04:47,724 --> 01:04:51,144
With no one to guide you out,
you'll be stuck in permanent psychosis.

719
01:04:51,186 --> 01:04:53,438
Doug, let Dr. Edgemar help you.

720
01:04:53,521 --> 01:04:55,982
The walls of reality
will come crashing down.

721
01:04:56,024 --> 01:04:59,486
One minute you'll be the savior of
the rebel cause, and right after that...

722
01:04:59,569 --> 01:05:01,738
you'll be Cohaagen's bosom buddy.

723
01:05:01,821 --> 01:05:05,742
You'll even have fantasies about
alien civilizations, as you requested...

724
01:05:05,825 --> 01:05:08,536
but in the end,
back on earth you'll be lobotomized!

725
01:05:11,081 --> 01:05:14,542
So get a grip on yourself, Doug,
and put down that gun!

726
01:05:20,507 --> 01:05:23,760
Good. Now take the pill
and put it in your mouth.

727
01:05:28,515 --> 01:05:30,684
Swallow it!

728
01:05:33,144 --> 01:05:35,689
Go ahead, sweetheart.

729
01:05:58,378 --> 01:06:01,715
Now you've done it.
Now you've done it!

730
01:06:22,569 --> 01:06:25,030
That's for making me come to Mars.

731
01:06:26,323 --> 01:06:29,242
You know how much I hate
this fucking planet!

732
01:06:31,661 --> 01:06:32,912
Cuff him.

733
01:06:39,544 --> 01:06:42,922
-I got him.
-Bring him down in the service elevator.

734
01:06:45,216 --> 01:06:46,635
Let's go.

735
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:01,209
Fuck you!

736
01:08:12,095 --> 01:08:13,013
Doug.

737
01:08:14,931 --> 01:08:17,017
Honey...

738
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,686
you wouldn't hurt me,
would you, sweetheart?

739
01:08:21,438 --> 01:08:24,733
Sweetheart, be reasonable.

740
01:08:24,816 --> 01:08:26,901
After all, we're married.

741
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:33,908
Consider that a divorce.

742
01:08:36,369 --> 01:08:38,079
That was your wife?

743
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,418
What a bitch.

744
01:08:51,551 --> 01:08:53,637
Hey, get out of the way!

745
01:08:56,097 --> 01:08:58,683
I thought you didn't like me.

746
01:08:58,725 --> 01:09:01,686
If Cohaagen wants you dead,
you might be okay.

747
01:09:01,728 --> 01:09:05,065
- Got it.
- So you've come back to apologize.

748
01:09:05,148 --> 01:09:07,192
Kuato wants to see you.

749
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:10,403
Come on.

750
01:09:38,848 --> 01:09:40,433
- Now what?
- Jump!

751
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:13,967
No! Don't do it!
You'll crack the fucking dome!

752
01:10:17,512 --> 01:10:20,807
What are you trying to do, kill us?
The dome will crack!

753
01:10:32,902 --> 01:10:33,987
Move!

754
01:10:36,072 --> 01:10:37,907
Taxi!

755
01:10:38,908 --> 01:10:40,827
Melina! Melina!

756
01:10:43,955 --> 01:10:45,540
- Need a ride?
- Last Resort.

757
01:10:45,624 --> 01:10:47,125
You guys are going in circles.

758
01:10:52,172 --> 01:10:53,173
Jesus!

759
01:10:53,256 --> 01:10:55,467
Come on! You drive!

760
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:56,676
You guys are in trouble?

761
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,345
Go! Go!

762
01:11:09,272 --> 01:11:12,192
- What are you trying to do to me?
- Shut up and drive!

763
01:11:12,275 --> 01:11:14,527
Hey, I got five kids to feed!

764
01:11:48,561 --> 01:11:49,729
Shit!

765
01:11:49,813 --> 01:11:51,648
No brakes!

766
01:11:51,731 --> 01:11:53,358
You idiot!

767
01:11:56,569 --> 01:11:57,570
What are you doing?

768
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:13,169
Christ! Now they're after me!

769
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:15,797
Give me that!

770
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,632
Get out of the way!

771
01:12:24,431 --> 01:12:25,682
Tony!

772
01:12:29,394 --> 01:12:31,771
Get out of the way!
Come on!

773
01:12:31,855 --> 01:12:34,357
Come on! Come on!

774
01:12:37,652 --> 01:12:39,112
Thank you, Tony.

775
01:13:04,054 --> 01:13:06,222
You wanna have some fun?

776
01:13:06,306 --> 01:13:07,474
Where are they?

777
01:13:07,557 --> 01:13:10,268
What are you talking about?
I don't know.

778
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:20,111
Maybe you know.

779
01:13:26,993 --> 01:13:28,662
Kill them all!

780
01:13:42,842 --> 01:13:43,927
Thumbelina!

781
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:10,662
Richter!

782
01:14:10,704 --> 01:14:13,915
- A call from Cohaagen!
- Richter here.

783
01:14:13,999 --> 01:14:17,002
- We've got them pinned down.
- Stop fighting and pull out.

784
01:14:17,043 --> 01:14:18,962
But they've got Quaid.
They're protecting him.

785
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:23,383
Perfect.
Get out of Sector G now.

786
01:14:23,466 --> 01:14:25,010
Don't think.

787
01:14:25,135 --> 01:14:27,887
- Do it!
- Yes, sir.

788
01:14:27,971 --> 01:14:29,639
Pull 'em out.

789
01:14:29,723 --> 01:14:32,058
Everybody, pull out!

790
01:14:32,142 --> 01:14:33,727
Move!

791
01:14:42,777 --> 01:14:45,697
- Cohaagen's sealing off the area!
- Come on, Benny!

792
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:49,261
The first settlers
are buried here.

793
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:53,306
They worked themselves to death, but
Cohaagen ended up with all the money.

794
01:15:53,348 --> 01:15:56,184
He built cheap domes and watched
the kids turn into freaks.

795
01:15:56,268 --> 01:15:57,519
I saw them.

796
01:15:57,602 --> 01:16:00,313
And if you want to breathe,
you have to buy his air.

797
01:16:00,397 --> 01:16:01,982
Maybe you can change all that.

798
01:16:02,065 --> 01:16:06,319
Hey, I think my grandpa
might be here.

799
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:07,988
So what can I do?

800
01:16:08,071 --> 01:16:10,699
Kuato's gonna make you remember some
things you knew when you were Hauser.

801
01:16:10,782 --> 01:16:13,535
- Like what?
- All sorts of things.

802
01:16:13,618 --> 01:16:16,621
- Maybe you'll remember you loved me.
- I don't need Kuato for that.

803
01:16:17,872 --> 01:16:19,874
Since when?

804
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:30,677
Freeze!

805
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,971
Come on, Melina.

806
01:16:34,306 --> 01:16:35,724
Kuato's waiting.

807
01:16:35,807 --> 01:16:38,059
I didn't find Grandpa, but--

808
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:40,854
Oh, shit.

809
01:16:40,895 --> 01:16:44,065
- Who's this?
- He helped us get away.

810
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:48,361
Hey, don't worry about me, man.
I'm on your side.

811
01:16:58,955 --> 01:17:00,915
You're a mutant, huh?

812
01:17:00,957 --> 01:17:03,293
All right, let's go.

813
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:21,227
- Have you tried ramming down the door?
- You wait here. Follow me.

814
01:17:21,311 --> 01:17:23,229
It won't do any good.

815
01:17:23,313 --> 01:17:26,650
- Cohaagen depressurized the tunnels.
- Then drill through to Section M.

816
01:17:26,733 --> 01:17:29,694
We can't.
We're running out of air.

817
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:31,780
We need help.

818
01:17:31,863 --> 01:17:34,532
Sit tight.
Melina just got here with Quaid.

819
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:37,369
I hope he was worth it.

820
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:39,079
So do I.

821
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:43,375
- I'm glad you made it.
- You don't look glad.

822
01:17:43,416 --> 01:17:46,711
Cohaagen sealed up Venusville.
He shut off the air.

823
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:49,047
You must know something
pretty important, Quaid.

824
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:51,091
He wants you.

825
01:17:51,132 --> 01:17:54,970
If we don't hand you over, everybody
in this sector will be dead by morning.

826
01:17:55,053 --> 01:17:56,721
Then we don't have much choice.

827
01:17:56,805 --> 01:17:58,348
We can't turn him in.

828
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:02,018
That's up to Kuato.
Come with me, Quaid.

829
01:18:16,199 --> 01:18:18,243
Sit down.

830
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:21,121
- Where's Kuato?
- On his way.

831
01:18:21,204 --> 01:18:23,748
You heard the rumors
about the Pyramid Mine?

832
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:25,667
Yeah.

833
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:29,129
Cohaagen found something weird inside
and it's got him scared shitless.

834
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:31,464
What? Aliens?

835
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:35,844
- You tell me.
- I don't know.

836
01:18:35,927 --> 01:18:38,471
Yes, you do.
That's why we brought you here.

837
01:18:38,555 --> 01:18:41,182
Cohaagen's big secret
is buried in that black hole...

838
01:18:41,266 --> 01:18:43,184
you call a brain.

839
01:18:45,812 --> 01:18:47,814
And Kuato's gonna dig it out.

840
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:51,318
- You're Kuato, right?
- Wrong.

841
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:55,196
Kuato's a mutant,
so don't get upset when you see him.

842
01:19:33,902 --> 01:19:36,071
What do you want, Mr. Quaid?

843
01:19:36,947 --> 01:19:38,907
Same as you: to remember.

844
01:19:38,949 --> 01:19:41,701
But why?

845
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:45,038
- To be myself again.
- You are what you do.

846
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:50,669
A man is defined by his actions...

847
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:53,880
not his memory.

848
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:56,383
Please...

849
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:58,510
take my hands.

850
01:20:04,057 --> 01:20:06,476
Now open your mind to me.

851
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:08,895
Please.

852
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:14,234
Open your mind.

853
01:20:16,486 --> 01:20:19,030
Open your mind.

854
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:24,577
Open your mind.

855
01:20:26,329 --> 01:20:30,041
Open your mind.

856
01:20:31,835 --> 01:20:36,214
Open your mind.

857
01:21:06,786 --> 01:21:09,164
We should blow the thing up
before the rebels turn it on.

858
01:21:09,247 --> 01:21:11,875
I say we throw the switch
and see what happens.

859
01:21:11,958 --> 01:21:13,960
- Don't be an idiot.
- We can't risk it.

860
01:21:14,044 --> 01:21:16,755
The chain reaction could spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.

861
01:21:16,796 --> 01:21:20,008
That means a meltdown,
a meltdown on a planetary scale.

862
01:21:20,091 --> 01:21:22,385
Don't you think whoever
built this thing thought of that?

863
01:21:22,469 --> 01:21:25,639
Who knows what the hell they thought?
They weren't human.

864
01:21:25,722 --> 01:21:28,391
Maybe it's a trap.
Maybe they want a meltdown.

865
01:21:28,475 --> 01:21:30,644
We don't even know
if this piece of junk will work.

866
01:21:30,727 --> 01:21:33,063
What is it?
A million? Half a million?

867
01:21:33,146 --> 01:21:36,441
- About half a million.
- Half a million years old.

868
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:38,276
Let's make sure Kuato--

869
01:22:08,765 --> 01:22:12,727
Wake up! Wake up!
Come on, wake up!

870
01:22:14,062 --> 01:22:16,648
They found us! Shit!
Let's go!

871
01:22:17,857 --> 01:22:20,110
Wake up! Snap out of it!
Come on!

872
01:22:24,698 --> 01:22:26,074
They found us!

873
01:22:26,157 --> 01:22:27,659
- Everybody out!
- Melina!

874
01:22:27,742 --> 01:22:29,828
Get moving! Get out!

875
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:31,830
Get out!

876
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:43,842
Everybody out! Get out!

877
01:22:49,514 --> 01:22:51,975
Get to the air lock! Follow me!

878
01:22:53,602 --> 01:22:55,228
Benny, come on!

879
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:01,901
- Benny!
- I'm coming!

880
01:23:21,046 --> 01:23:24,674
Put these spacesuits on!
We're going outside!

881
01:23:27,594 --> 01:23:29,346
Benny, hurry.

882
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:38,772
Congratulations, Quaid.

883
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:41,107
You led us right to him.

884
01:23:41,191 --> 01:23:43,944
How can you do this?
You're a mutant.

885
01:23:44,903 --> 01:23:46,821
I got four kids to feed.

886
01:23:46,905 --> 01:23:49,074
So what happened to number five?

887
01:23:51,534 --> 01:23:54,162
Shit, man. You got me.

888
01:23:54,245 --> 01:23:55,956
I ain't even married.

889
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:58,166
Now put your fucking hands
in the air!

890
01:24:04,047 --> 01:24:05,507
Quaid.

891
01:24:07,592 --> 01:24:09,636
Quaid.

892
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:15,642
Forget it, man.
His fortunetelling days are over.

893
01:24:17,394 --> 01:24:20,272
Start the reactor.

894
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:22,232
Free Mars.

895
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:29,948
Mr. Cohaagen
would like to talk to you.

896
01:24:37,789 --> 01:24:40,166
So this is the great man.

897
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:47,173
No wonder he kept out of sight.

898
01:24:49,426 --> 01:24:51,386
Well, my boy...

899
01:24:53,597 --> 01:24:54,681
you're a hero.

900
01:24:54,764 --> 01:24:55,849
Fuck you.

901
01:24:55,932 --> 01:24:59,686
Don't be modest.
Kuato is dead.

902
01:24:59,728 --> 01:25:04,065
The resistance is completely wiped out,
and you were the key to the whole thing.

903
01:25:04,149 --> 01:25:05,567
He's lying.

904
01:25:06,443 --> 01:25:08,612
You two-faced bastard.

905
01:25:10,488 --> 01:25:14,159
You can't blame him, angel.
He's innocent.

906
01:25:15,785 --> 01:25:20,206
You see, Quaid, none of my people
could get close to Kuato.

907
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:23,209
Fucking mutants
could always sniff us out.

908
01:25:23,293 --> 01:25:27,380
So Hauser and I sat down
and invented you, the perfect mole.

909
01:25:27,464 --> 01:25:30,634
You know you're lying.
Hauser turned against you.

910
01:25:34,429 --> 01:25:36,389
That's what we wanted
you to think.

911
01:25:36,473 --> 01:25:40,602
The fact is, Hauser volunteered
to become Doug Quaid.

912
01:25:40,685 --> 01:25:43,688
It was the only way
to fool the psychics.

913
01:25:43,772 --> 01:25:45,273
Get your story straight.

914
01:25:45,357 --> 01:25:48,860
This idiot has been trying to kill me
ever since I went to Rekall.

915
01:25:48,944 --> 01:25:51,237
You don't kill somebody
you're trying to plant.

916
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:55,241
He wasn't in on it.
You set him off by going to Rekall.

917
01:25:55,283 --> 01:25:58,244
- So why am I still alive?
- We gave you lots of help.

918
01:25:58,286 --> 01:26:00,246
- Benny here.
- My pleasure, man.

919
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:03,875
The guy with the suitcase,
the mask, the money...

920
01:26:03,917 --> 01:26:07,879
the message from Hauser,
all of that was set up by us.

921
01:26:07,963 --> 01:26:10,465
Sorry. Too perfect.

922
01:26:10,548 --> 01:26:12,217
Perfect, my ass!

923
01:26:12,259 --> 01:26:14,886
You pop your memory cap
before we can activate you.

924
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:19,057
Richter goes hog-wild, screwing up
everything I spent a year planning.

925
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:21,977
Frankly, I'm amazed it worked.

926
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:24,604
Well, Cohaagen...

927
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:28,316
I have to hand it to you.
It's the best mind-fuck yet.

928
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:32,779
Well, don't take my word for it.

929
01:26:33,947 --> 01:26:37,075
-Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
-Who is it this time?

930
01:26:37,117 --> 01:26:39,119
My mother?

931
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:42,622
Howdy, Quaid.

932
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:46,167
If you're listening to this,
it means that Kuato is dead...

933
01:26:46,251 --> 01:26:48,628
and you have led us to him.

934
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:50,672
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

935
01:26:50,755 --> 01:26:52,924
Sorry for the shit
I've put you through, but hey...

936
01:26:53,008 --> 01:26:55,510
what are friends for?

937
01:26:55,594 --> 01:26:58,888
I would like to wish you happiness
and long life, old buddy...

938
01:26:58,972 --> 01:27:01,975
but unfortunately,
this is not gonna happen.

939
01:27:02,017 --> 01:27:06,187
You see, it's my body you've got there
and I want it back.

940
01:27:06,271 --> 01:27:10,525
Sorry to be an lndian giver,
but I was here first.

941
01:27:10,609 --> 01:27:13,194
So adios, amigo.

942
01:27:13,278 --> 01:27:16,489
And thanks for not
getting yourself killed.

943
01:27:16,573 --> 01:27:19,200
Hey, maybe we'll meet
in our dreams.

944
01:27:22,829 --> 01:27:24,748
You never know.

945
01:27:29,502 --> 01:27:31,588
You bastards!

946
01:27:49,731 --> 01:27:51,232
Let go of me!

947
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:09,417
- Ready?
- Auto.

948
01:28:09,501 --> 01:28:12,420
- Check.
- Ready to go, sir.

949
01:28:14,422 --> 01:28:16,675
Relax, Quaid.

950
01:28:16,716 --> 01:28:20,095
- You'll like being Hauser.
- The guy's a fucking asshole.

951
01:28:20,178 --> 01:28:23,431
That's not true.
He's one of my best friends.

952
01:28:23,515 --> 01:28:26,434
Besides, he's got
a big house and a Mercedes.

953
01:28:26,518 --> 01:28:30,522
And you like Melina, right?
You'll get to fuck her every night.

954
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:33,733
That's right.
She's going to be Hauser's babe.

955
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:35,986
I'll bust his balls.

956
01:28:38,113 --> 01:28:40,407
Uh-uh, princess.

957
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:42,909
We're having you fixed.

958
01:28:42,951 --> 01:28:46,329
You're going to be respectful,
compliant...

959
01:28:46,413 --> 01:28:49,916
and appreciative,
the way a woman should be.

960
01:28:53,670 --> 01:28:55,755
Mr. Cohaagen, telephone.

961
01:28:58,508 --> 01:29:00,176
Yes? What is it?

962
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:03,096
The oxygen level
is bottoming out in Sector G.

963
01:29:03,138 --> 01:29:05,348
What do you want me
to do about it?

964
01:29:05,432 --> 01:29:09,477
- Don't do anything.
- But they won't last an hour, sir.

965
01:29:09,561 --> 01:29:10,645
Fuck 'em.

966
01:29:10,729 --> 01:29:13,273
It'll be a good lesson
to the others.

967
01:29:13,356 --> 01:29:16,067
You got what you want.
Give these people air.

968
01:29:16,109 --> 01:29:19,904
My friend, in five minutes
you won't give a shit about the people.

969
01:29:19,946 --> 01:29:21,239
Fire it up, Doc.

970
01:29:21,323 --> 01:29:23,408
Excuse me, Doctor.

971
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:25,660
- Is he gonna remember any of this?
- Not a thing.

972
01:29:26,578 --> 01:29:27,829
Oh, really?

973
01:29:38,298 --> 01:29:39,966
Quaid, I'm having a party tonight.

974
01:29:40,008 --> 01:29:42,761
Why don't you and Melina drop by.
Remind him, Doc.

975
01:29:42,844 --> 01:29:45,180
- Sure.
- See you at the party.

976
01:29:59,736 --> 01:30:02,238
Keep still.
Fighting just makes it hurt.

977
01:30:15,043 --> 01:30:17,837
If you don't keep still,
you'll end up psychotic.

978
01:30:22,008 --> 01:30:23,468
Hey, don't!

979
01:30:30,433 --> 01:30:32,143
Melina, hold on!

980
01:30:55,041 --> 01:30:58,378
Are you all right?
Are you still you?

981
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:01,840
I'm not sure, dear.
What do you think?

982
01:31:04,676 --> 01:31:06,094
Let's get the hell out of here.

983
01:31:33,622 --> 01:31:35,957
You have to make a decision, sir.

984
01:31:46,426 --> 01:31:47,677
Kill him.

985
01:31:48,887 --> 01:31:50,889
It's about goddamn time.

986
01:32:43,149 --> 01:32:45,944
- Where are you going?
- To the reactor.

987
01:32:46,027 --> 01:32:49,781
- What reactor?
- The one in the mines. Come on!

988
01:32:49,864 --> 01:32:53,827
People are dying, Quaid!
Stop! We've got to get air!

989
01:32:53,868 --> 01:32:57,080
The reactor makes air.
That's Cohaagen's secret. Let's go.

990
01:32:57,163 --> 01:32:58,748
Where's this reactor come from?

991
01:32:58,832 --> 01:33:00,875
- Aliens built it.
- Aliens?

992
01:33:00,959 --> 01:33:04,296
- Are you sure about this?
- It's just up ahead.

993
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:08,133
What the hell--

994
01:33:32,616 --> 01:33:33,575
Quaid!

995
01:33:33,617 --> 01:33:36,745
Hey, Quaid, you remember me?

996
01:33:36,828 --> 01:33:39,164
Benny! Benny's the name!

997
01:33:53,303 --> 01:33:54,804
Oh, that's good!

998
01:34:00,602 --> 01:34:02,896
I'm gonna drill you, sucker!

999
01:34:02,938 --> 01:34:04,898
I'm gonna grind you up!

1000
01:34:11,947 --> 01:34:13,949
I'm coming!

1001
01:34:14,032 --> 01:34:15,700
I'm coming for you, baby!

1002
01:34:31,174 --> 01:34:33,426
What the fuck is this?

1003
01:34:39,975 --> 01:34:42,102
Damn this piece of Martian junk!

1004
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:47,232
Hey, Quaid,
I'm gonna squash you!

1005
01:34:48,191 --> 01:34:50,110
Benny, here!

1006
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:54,906
Where the fuck are you?

1007
01:35:00,578 --> 01:35:02,330
Screw you!

1008
01:35:08,378 --> 01:35:10,463
Quaid, get over here!

1009
01:35:10,547 --> 01:35:12,299
What is it?

1010
01:35:13,258 --> 01:35:14,342
There's an opening.

1011
01:35:15,468 --> 01:35:17,137
I knew it.

1012
01:35:45,874 --> 01:35:49,169
This whole thing is one big reactor
made out of terbinium.

1013
01:35:49,252 --> 01:35:52,672
Cohaagen knows it makes air.
The bastard won't turn it on.

1014
01:35:52,714 --> 01:35:54,007
Of course not.

1015
01:35:54,049 --> 01:35:57,010
If Mars had an atmosphere,
he'd lose control.

1016
01:35:58,178 --> 01:35:59,596
See down there?

1017
01:36:00,722 --> 01:36:03,183
It's a glacier.

1018
01:36:03,224 --> 01:36:06,353
The whole core of Mars is ice.

1019
01:36:06,394 --> 01:36:08,813
The reactor melts it...

1020
01:36:08,897 --> 01:36:10,732
and it releases the oxygen.

1021
01:36:10,815 --> 01:36:12,192
Come on.

1022
01:36:12,233 --> 01:36:15,236
- Enough for everyone to breathe?
- Sure.

1023
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:18,239
Enough for the whole planet.

1024
01:36:18,323 --> 01:36:20,575
If we turn it on in time.

1025
01:36:27,207 --> 01:36:29,167
Come on. Come on!

1026
01:36:46,351 --> 01:36:47,435
Hold on.

1027
01:37:18,675 --> 01:37:19,634
Now!

1028
01:37:50,165 --> 01:37:51,374
Son of a bitch.

1029
01:37:59,090 --> 01:37:59,758
Go!

1030
01:38:03,511 --> 01:38:05,680
He's got a hologram!

1031
01:38:27,535 --> 01:38:30,205
You think this is
the real Quaid? It is.

1032
01:39:50,076 --> 01:39:52,203
You're coming with me!

1033
01:40:05,675 --> 01:40:07,928
See you at the party, Richter.

1034
01:40:46,174 --> 01:40:47,425
Don't touch that!

1035
01:40:47,467 --> 01:40:49,469
Get away! Get back!

1036
01:40:49,511 --> 01:40:50,971
What are you afraid of?

1037
01:40:51,012 --> 01:40:53,431
- Turn it on.
- Impossible!

1038
01:40:53,515 --> 01:40:56,643
Once the reaction starts, it'll spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.

1039
01:40:56,726 --> 01:40:59,020
Mars will go into
global meltdown.

1040
01:40:59,104 --> 01:41:01,773
That's why the aliens
never turned it on.

1041
01:41:01,856 --> 01:41:03,942
And you expect me
to believe you?

1042
01:41:04,025 --> 01:41:08,571
Who gives a shit what you believe?
ln 30 seconds you'll be dead.

1043
01:41:08,655 --> 01:41:12,033
Then I'll blow this place up
and be home in time for corn flakes.

1044
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:17,539
I didn't want it to end this way.

1045
01:41:17,622 --> 01:41:19,666
I wanted Hauser back.
But no.

1046
01:41:20,875 --> 01:41:23,128
You had to be Quaid!

1047
01:41:23,169 --> 01:41:25,630
- I am Quaid.
- You're nothing!

1048
01:41:25,714 --> 01:41:28,800
You're nobody!
You're a stupid dream.

1049
01:41:28,883 --> 01:41:32,887
Well, all dreams come to an end.

1050
01:42:47,671 --> 01:42:50,048
Melina, hold on!

1051
01:42:50,090 --> 01:42:51,716
Don't do it!

1052
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:53,760
We'll all die!

1053
01:42:54,636 --> 01:42:57,097
Everybody will die!

1054
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,703
Quaid!

1055
01:49:16,810 --> 01:49:19,229
I can't believe it.
It's like a dream.

1056
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:22,148
What's wrong?

1057
01:49:22,232 --> 01:49:26,027
I just had a terrible thought.
What if this is a dream?

1058
01:49:27,570 --> 01:49:30,657
Well, then kiss me quick
before you wake up.
