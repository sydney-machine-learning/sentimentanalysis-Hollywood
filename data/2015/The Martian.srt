1
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:08,024
All right, team,
stay in sight of each other.

2
00:02:08,124 --> 00:02:10,484
Let's make NASA proud today.

3
00:02:10,584 --> 00:02:12,194
How's it looking over there, Watney?

4
00:02:12,294 --> 00:02:16,616
Well, you'll be happy to hear
that in Grid Section 14-28,

5
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:19,584
the particles were predominantly coarse,

6
00:02:19,684 --> 00:02:22,894
but in 29, they're... they're much finer

7
00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:24,958
and they should be ideal
for chem analysis.

8
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:27,895
Oh, wow. Did everybody hear that?
Mark just discovered dirt.

9
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,546
Should we alert the media?

10
00:02:29,646 --> 00:02:33,551
Sorry, what are you doing today, Martinez?
Making sure the MAV is still upright?

11
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:35,845
I'd like you to know that visual
inspection of the equipment

12
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:37,530
is imperative to mission success.

13
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:40,541
I also would like to report
that the MAV is still upright.

14
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:45,004
Watney, you keep leaving your channel open
which leads to Martinez responding

15
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:48,200
which leads to all of us listening
which leads to me being annoyed.

16
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,928
Roger that. Martinez, the captain
would like you to please...

17
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:53,630
shut your smart mouth.

18
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,117
We'd prefer to use a different adjective
to describe Martinez's mouth.

19
00:02:57,217 --> 00:03:01,055
- Oh, did Beck just insult me?
- "Dr. Beck." And yes.

20
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:04,843
Happy to turn the radios off from here,
Commander. Just say the word.

21
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:07,703
Wait, Johanssen. Constant
communication is the hallmark...

22
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:09,831
- Shut 'em off.
- No.

23
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:11,992
No. Excuse me.

24
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,152
I apologize for my countrymen, Vogel.

25
00:03:14,252 --> 00:03:17,856
Accepted. How many samples
do we need, Commander?

26
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:21,227
Seven. 100 grams each.

27
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,035
We have a mission update.
A storm warning.

28
00:03:29,135 --> 00:03:31,971
Commander, you should come inside.
You're gonna want to see this.

29
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:34,173
- What is it?
- A storm warning.

30
00:03:34,273 --> 00:03:37,820
I saw that in this morning's briefing.
We'll be inside before it hits.

31
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,881
Yeah, they upgraded their estimate.

32
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:43,826
The storm's gonna be a lot worse.

33
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:52,060
Martinez, how does it look?

34
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,912
Not good.

35
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:59,183
"1,200 kilometers in diameter,
bearing 24.41 degrees."

36
00:03:59,283 --> 00:04:00,401
That's tracking right towards us.

37
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:05,298
"Based on current escalation,
estimated force of 8,600 newtons."

38
00:04:05,398 --> 00:04:08,936
- What's the abort force?
- 7,500.

39
00:04:09,436 --> 00:04:11,671
Anything more than that
and the MAV could tip.

40
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:14,984
- Do we scrub?
- Begin abort procedure.

41
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:19,313
We are estimating with a margin of error.
We... could wait it out.

42
00:04:19,413 --> 00:04:21,564
Let's wait it out.

43
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,736
Let's wait it out.

44
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:29,265
- Commander?
- Prep emergency departure.

45
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:32,164
- Commander?
- We're scrubbed. That's an order.

46
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,508
- Martinez, how long before take-off?
- 12 minutes.

47
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:54,033
Visibility is almost zero. Anyone gets lost,
hone in on my suit's telemetry.

48
00:04:54,133 --> 00:04:56,998
- You ready?
- Ready.

49
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:02,528
- Commander, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

50
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:28,879
Commander, we're at 10 degrees,
and the MAV is gonna tip at 12.3.

51
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:32,842
Hey! We might be able to keep
the MAV from tipping.

52
00:05:32,942 --> 00:05:34,051
How?

53
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:37,171
Use the cables from the comms
mast as guy-lines,

54
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:40,349
- anchor it with the Rover's.
- Watch out!

55
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:45,450
Watney!

56
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,783
Warning. Suit breach detected.

57
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:50,510
- What happened?
- He was hit.

58
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,853
Watney, report.

59
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:54,764
Before we lost telemetry,
his decompression alarm went off.

60
00:05:54,865 --> 00:05:57,358
- Where did you last see him?
- I don't know where he is.

61
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,485
- What are the vitals on his suit?
- He's offline.

62
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:00,987
A complete loss of signal on Watney.

63
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:02,223
- Beck!
- Yeah.

64
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:06,180
- How long can he survive decompression?
- Less than a minute.

65
00:06:06,427 --> 00:06:08,758
Line up, walk west.

66
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:11,816
He may be prone.
We don't wanna step over him.

67
00:06:12,616 --> 00:06:16,498
- Commander We're at 10.5 degrees.
- Warning. Excessive tilt.

68
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:19,843
Tilting to 11 with all
the gusts of wind.

69
00:06:19,943 --> 00:06:23,520
Copy that. Everyone,
hone in on Martinez's suit.

70
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,148
It'll get you to airlock.
Get in, prep for launch.

71
00:06:26,248 --> 00:06:29,784
- What about you, Commander?
- I'm gonna search a little longer.

72
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:33,119
Get moving! Go!

73
00:06:35,624 --> 00:06:38,995
Watney! Watney, report!

74
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:43,122
The MAV's at 11.6 degrees.
One good gust and we're tipping.

75
00:06:43,222 --> 00:06:46,269
- If it tips, you launch.
- You really think I'm gonna leave you behind?

76
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:48,650
That's an order, Martinez.

77
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,739
Mark!

78
00:06:50,757 --> 00:06:54,006
Mark! Can you hear me?

79
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,691
Martinez, what about the proximity radar?
Could that detect Watney's suit?

80
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:03,528
It's made to see the Hermes from orbit not
a little piece of metal from a single suit.

81
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:05,189
- Give it a try.
- Roger.

82
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:08,309
What is she thinking? She knows
the infrared can't get through a sandstorm.

83
00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:10,403
She's grasping for anything.

84
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:12,772
We've got negative contact
on the proximity radar.

85
00:07:12,873 --> 00:07:15,996
- Nothing?
- No. I can barely see the Hab.

86
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:20,505
Commander, I know you don't
wanna hear this, but... Mark is dead.

87
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:23,417
Commander!

88
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:25,978
Hey, what the hell
is wrong with you, man?

89
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,464
My friend just died.
I don't want my commander to die, too.

90
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:31,000
- Stability warning.
- We're tipping!

91
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,461
Commander, you need
to get back to the ship, now!

92
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:36,050
13 degrees.

93
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,040
If we pass balance,
we'll never rock back.

94
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,095
I've got one more trick left, and then
I'm following orders, Commander.

95
00:07:43,104 --> 00:07:45,129
You're firing the OMS?

96
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:47,256
That's right.

97
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:53,887
- Commander!
- On my way.

98
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:58,659
Johanssen, let's go.

99
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:07,217
Mark!

100
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:22,619
We're at 11.5 and holding.

101
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:27,070
Ready to go on your command.

102
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:30,388
Ready to launch.

103
00:08:30,488 --> 00:08:33,872
Commander. I need you to verbally
tell me whether or not to.

104
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,846
Launch.

105
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:19,598
At around 4:30 a.m.
Central Standard Time

106
00:09:19,698 --> 00:09:24,838
our satellites detected a storm approaching
the Ares 3 mission site on Mars.

107
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:28,117
At 6:45, the storm
had escalated to severe

108
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:31,327
and we had no choice
but to abort the mission.

109
00:09:31,427 --> 00:09:34,056
Thanks to the quick action
of Commander Lewis

110
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:37,381
astronauts Beck, Johanssen,
Martinez and Vogel

111
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:40,137
were all able to reach
the Mars Ascent Vehicle

112
00:09:40,237 --> 00:09:45,334
and perform an emergency launch
at 7:28 Central Time.

113
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:47,694
Unfortunately, during the evacuation,

114
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:52,874
astronaut Mark Watney
was struck by debris and killed.

115
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:56,780
Commander Lewis and the rest of her team
were able to intercept safely

116
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:59,615
with the Hermes
and are now heading home.

117
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:02,493
But Mark Watney is dead.

118
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:05,074
Director Sanders!

119
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,494
Director Sanders!

120
00:10:38,432 --> 00:10:41,587
Oxygen level critical.

121
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,187
Oxygen level critical.

122
00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:58,703
Oxygen level cri...

123
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,523
Pressure stable.

124
00:15:18,054 --> 00:15:19,092
Fuck.

125
00:15:49,104 --> 00:15:50,197
Okay.

126
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:52,095
Okay.

127
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:57,622
Hello, this is Mark Watney, astronaut.

128
00:15:58,113 --> 00:16:01,241
I'm entering this log for the record...

129
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:03,917
in case I don't make it.

130
00:16:04,273 --> 00:16:06,234
It is...

131
00:16:06,534 --> 00:16:08,967
06:53...

132
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:12,378
on Sol 19 and...

133
00:16:12,478 --> 00:16:14,713
I'm alive.

134
00:16:14,814 --> 00:16:17,026
Obviously. But...

135
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:22,164
I'm guessing that's gonna come as a surprise
to my crewmates and to NASA.

136
00:16:22,264 --> 00:16:25,938
And to the entire world, really, so...

137
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,232
Surprise.

138
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:33,150
I did not die on Sol 18.

139
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,078
Best I can figure...

140
00:16:35,178 --> 00:16:38,990
this length of our primary communications
antenna broke off...

141
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:44,170
and tore through my bio-monitor
and ripped a hole in me as well.

142
00:16:44,495 --> 00:16:47,582
But the antenna and the blood, really,

143
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:51,303
managed to seal the breach in my suit
which kept me alive,

144
00:16:51,403 --> 00:16:54,473
even though the crew
must have thought I was dead.

145
00:16:54,573 --> 00:16:57,184
I have no way to contact NASA.

146
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:59,450
And even if I could, it's gonna be...

147
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,385
four years until a manned
mission can reach me.

148
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,027
And I'm in a Hab designed
to last 31 days.

149
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:08,405
If the oxygenator breaks,
I'm gonna suffocate.

150
00:17:08,505 --> 00:17:10,874
If the water reclaimer breaks,
I'll die of thirst.

151
00:17:10,974 --> 00:17:15,320
If the Hab breaches,
I'm just gonna, kind of implode.

152
00:17:15,821 --> 00:17:19,207
And if by some miracle,
none of that happens...

153
00:17:19,307 --> 00:17:22,035
eventually I'm gonna run out of food.

154
00:17:23,171 --> 00:17:25,014
So...

155
00:17:25,915 --> 00:17:27,795
yeah.

156
00:17:30,644 --> 00:17:32,513
Yeah.

157
00:19:20,686 --> 00:19:23,141
I'm not gonna die here.

158
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,268
32...

159
00:20:05,368 --> 00:20:07,386
33...

160
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,077
34...

161
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,992
35, 36.

162
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:15,769
Sweet and sour chicken.

163
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,182
What do we got?

164
00:20:56,113 --> 00:20:58,590
Right, let's do the math.

165
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,344
Our surface mission here
was supposed to last 31 sols.

166
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:05,614
For redundancy, they sent 68 sols
worth of food. That's for 6 people.

167
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:08,392
So for just me,
that's gonna last 300 sols

168
00:21:08,492 --> 00:21:11,822
which I figure I can stretch
to 400 if I ration. So...

169
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:14,992
I got to figure out a way to grow

170
00:21:15,092 --> 00:21:17,519
three years' worth of food here.

171
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:20,372
On a planet where nothing grows.

172
00:21:20,672 --> 00:21:22,524
Luckily...

173
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:26,996
I'm a botanist.

174
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:34,359
Mars will come to fear my botany powers.

175
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:21,837
Pressure stable.

176
00:22:31,298 --> 00:22:33,888
Staple came out.

177
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,449
Fuck you, Mars.

178
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:42,367
Johanssen, Jesus.

179
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:33,643
<i>...Monday, Happy Days</i>

180
00:24:33,743 --> 00:24:36,106
<i>Tuesday, Wednesday, Happy Days</i>

181
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:38,548
<i>Thursday, Friday, Happy Days</i>

182
00:24:38,648 --> 00:24:41,169
<i>The weekend comes, my cycle hums</i>

183
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:43,138
<i>Ready to race to you</i>

184
00:24:43,238 --> 00:24:45,498
The problem is water.

185
00:24:45,999 --> 00:24:51,169
I have created
126 square meters of soil.

186
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:56,398
But every cubic meter of soil requires
40 liters of water to be farmable.

187
00:24:56,598 --> 00:25:00,004
So I gotta make a lot more water.

188
00:25:00,731 --> 00:25:05,271
Good thing is, I know the recipe. You take
hydrogen, you add oxygen, you burn.

189
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:11,203
Now, I have hundreds of liters
of unused hydrazine at the MDV.

190
00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:14,554
If I run the hydrazine
over an iridium catalyst,

191
00:25:14,654 --> 00:25:17,132
it'll separate into N2 and H2.

192
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:21,203
And then if I just direct
the hydrogen into a small area...

193
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:23,380
and burn it.

194
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:26,766
Luckily, in the history of humanity

195
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:32,301
nothing bad has ever happened
from lighting hydrogen on fire.

196
00:25:32,401 --> 00:25:34,183
NASA hates fire.

197
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:38,429
Because of the whole "fire makes
everybody die in space" thing.

198
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:41,349
So, everything they sent us
up here with is flame-retardant

199
00:25:41,449 --> 00:25:45,733
with the notable exception of...

200
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:49,183
Martinez's personal items.

201
00:25:49,283 --> 00:25:51,969
I am sorry, Martinez, but if you didn't
want me to go through your stuff

202
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:54,930
you shouldn't have left me
for dead on a desolate planet.

203
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:59,451
By the way, I'm figuring you're gonna be
fine with this, given my present situation.

204
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:03,341
Counting on you.

205
00:26:23,911 --> 00:26:25,799
Whoo!

206
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:40,345
So, yeah, I blew myself up.

207
00:26:40,645 --> 00:26:43,031
Best guess...

208
00:26:43,131 --> 00:26:45,689
I forgot to...

209
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:49,175
account for the excess oxygen that...

210
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:53,467
I've been exhaling
when I did my calculations.

211
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:55,741
Because I'm stupid.

212
00:26:58,264 --> 00:27:00,533
Yeah, I'm gonna get back to work here,

213
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:03,647
just as soon as my ears stop ringing.

214
00:27:08,008 --> 00:27:12,337
Interesting side note, this is actually
how the Jet Propulsion Lab was founded.

215
00:27:12,437 --> 00:27:15,825
Five guys at Caltech
were trying to make rocket fuel

216
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,784
and they nearly burned down their dorm.

217
00:27:17,885 --> 00:27:22,006
And rather than expel them
they banished them to a nearby farm,

218
00:27:22,106 --> 00:27:24,450
told them to keep working.

219
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,312
And now we have a space program.

220
00:27:29,797 --> 00:27:31,571
Okay.

221
00:28:48,323 --> 00:28:49,941
Hey, there.

222
00:28:59,968 --> 00:29:03,580
The nation was blessed to have Mark
serving in our space program.

223
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,012
While his loss will be deeply felt,

224
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:08,685
the men and women of NASA
will soldier forth

225
00:29:08,785 --> 00:29:12,089
onward and upward
in the mission of their agency.

226
00:29:12,189 --> 00:29:16,644
By doing so, they honor the legacy,
Mark's leaving behind,

227
00:29:16,744 --> 00:29:20,773
and they ensure his sacrifice
will not be in vain.

228
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:34,597
I have the honor of speaking not only
for the men and women of NASA

229
00:29:34,697 --> 00:29:36,349
but for people all over the world...

230
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:39,649
I thought you gave
a lovely speech, by the way.

231
00:29:41,637 --> 00:29:45,103
- I need you to authorize my satellite time.
- It's not gonna happen.

232
00:29:45,203 --> 00:29:46,943
We're funded for five Ares missions.

233
00:29:47,043 --> 00:29:49,338
I think I can get Congress
to authorize a sixth.

234
00:29:49,438 --> 00:29:51,581
- No.
- Ares 3 evac'd after 18 sols.

235
00:29:51,681 --> 00:29:53,926
There's half a mission worth
of supplies up there.

236
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:56,503
I can sell it at a fraction
of the cost of a normal mission

237
00:29:56,603 --> 00:29:58,622
and all I have to know is
what's left of our assets.

238
00:29:58,722 --> 00:30:00,532
You're not the only one
who needs satellite time.

239
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,769
We've got the Ares 4
supply missions coming up.

240
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,104
We should be focusing
on the Schiaparelli Crater.

241
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:07,265
We got 12 satellites up there.
We can spare a few hours...

242
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:11,318
It's not about the satellite time, Vince.
We're a public domain organization.

243
00:30:11,418 --> 00:30:13,246
- We need to be transparent on this.
- Okay.

244
00:30:13,346 --> 00:30:16,224
The second we point the satellites
at the Hab I broadcast pictures

245
00:30:16,324 --> 00:30:19,710
- of Mark Watney's dead body to the world.
- You're afraid of a PR problem?

246
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:22,882
Of course I'm afraid of a PR problem.
Another mission?

247
00:30:22,982 --> 00:30:25,409
Congress won't reimburse us
for a paper clip

248
00:30:25,509 --> 00:30:28,520
if I put a dead astronaut on the front
page of The Washington Post.

249
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,740
He's not going anywhere, Teddy.
I mean, he's not...

250
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:35,102
He's not gonna decompose, you know.
He's gonna be up there forever.

251
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:37,981
Meteorology estimates
that he'll be covered in sand

252
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:39,799
from normal weather activity
within a year.

253
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,759
We can't wait a year. We got work to do.

254
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,597
Ares 5 won't even launch for five years.
We have plenty of time.

255
00:30:45,697 --> 00:30:47,532
Okay.

256
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,692
Okay.

257
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:52,605
Okay, consider this.

258
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:56,400
Right now, the world's on our side.

259
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,822
Sympathy for the Watney family.
Ares 6 could bring his body home.

260
00:31:00,922 --> 00:31:03,599
Now... we don't say
that's the purpose of the mission

261
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:06,794
but we make it clear that that would be
a part of it. We frame it that way.

262
00:31:07,295 --> 00:31:11,383
More support from Congress.
But not if we wait a year.

263
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:14,161
We wait a year, nobody gives a shit.

264
00:31:45,895 --> 00:31:47,914
Vincent Kapoor?

265
00:31:53,335 --> 00:31:54,877
6-2.

266
00:31:56,038 --> 00:31:58,358
7-6-2.

267
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:03,457
Acidalia Planitia.

268
00:32:14,707 --> 00:32:16,387
What?

269
00:32:30,892 --> 00:32:33,854
Hi. Security?
This is Mindy Park in SatCon.

270
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:37,191
I need the emergency contact
for Vincent Kapoor.

271
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:40,644
Yes, him. Yes, it's an emergency!

272
00:32:46,158 --> 00:32:49,270
- How sure?
- 100%.

273
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,848
You've got to be shitting me.

274
00:32:51,948 --> 00:32:53,591
Prove it to me.

275
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:57,653
For a start...

276
00:32:57,954 --> 00:33:01,958
- the solar panels have been cleaned.
- They could have been cleaned by wind.

277
00:33:02,058 --> 00:33:04,503
Back it up. Look at Rover 2.

278
00:33:04,603 --> 00:33:07,139
According to the logs,
Commander Lewis took it out on Sol 17

279
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:10,952
plugged it into the Hab to recharge.
It's been moved.

280
00:33:11,052 --> 00:33:14,263
- She could have forgotten to log the move.
- No, not likely.

281
00:33:14,363 --> 00:33:17,633
Why don't we just ask Lewis? Let's get
on CAPCOM and ask her directly right now.

282
00:33:17,733 --> 00:33:21,897
No. No. If Watney is really alive,
we don't want the Ares 3 crew to know.

283
00:33:21,997 --> 00:33:23,523
How can you not tell them?

284
00:33:23,623 --> 00:33:26,885
They have another 10 months on their
trip home. Space travel is dangerous.

285
00:33:26,985 --> 00:33:29,813
- They need to be alert and undistracted.
- But they already think he's dead.

286
00:33:29,913 --> 00:33:32,925
And they'd be devastated to find out
they left him there alive.

287
00:33:33,325 --> 00:33:37,957
I'm sorry, but you have not thought this
through. I mean, what are we gonna say?

288
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:41,943
"Dear America, remember that astronaut
we killed and had a really nice funeral for?

289
00:33:42,043 --> 00:33:46,272
"Turns out he's alive and we left him
on Mars. Our bad. Sincerely, NASA."

290
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:49,358
I mean, do you realize the shitstorm
that is about to hit us?

291
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:51,936
How are we going to handle the public?

292
00:33:52,036 --> 00:33:54,706
Legally, we have 24 hours
to release these pictures.

293
00:33:54,807 --> 00:33:58,560
We release a statement with them. We don't
want people working it out on their own.

294
00:33:58,961 --> 00:34:01,038
- Yes, sir.
- But if my math is right,

295
00:34:01,138 --> 00:34:04,822
he's going to starve to death
long before we can help him.

296
00:34:06,635 --> 00:34:08,955
Can you imagine what he's
going through up there?

297
00:34:09,155 --> 00:34:12,425
I mean, he's 50 million miles away from home.
He thinks he's totally alone.

298
00:34:12,525 --> 00:34:14,853
He thinks we gave up on him.

299
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:18,173
What does that do to a man,
psychologically?

300
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,070
What the hell is he thinking right now?

301
00:34:24,956 --> 00:34:27,975
I'm definitely gonna die up here...

302
00:34:28,075 --> 00:34:32,104
if I have to listen to any more
god-awful disco music.

303
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:36,758
My God, Commander Lewis, couldn't you
have packed anything from this century?

304
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:43,058
No, I am not gonna
"turn the beat around." I refuse to.

305
00:34:43,158 --> 00:34:45,836
Mr. Sanders? Mr. Sanders?

306
00:34:47,004 --> 00:34:49,980
What attempts have been made
to make contact with Mark Watney?

307
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,699
We're working on it.

308
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:55,537
- Does he have enough supplies to survive?
- We'll be looking into that.

309
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:58,557
What does this say about the agency?
Are you gonna resign?

310
00:34:58,657 --> 00:35:00,609
- No.
- Director Sanders!

311
00:35:05,256 --> 00:35:08,051
It's time to start thinking long term.

312
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:10,411
The next NASA mission is Ares 4

313
00:35:10,511 --> 00:35:13,056
and it's supposed to land
at Schiaparelli Crater

314
00:35:13,156 --> 00:35:15,600
3200 kilometers away.

315
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,983
3,200 kilometers.

316
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:24,960
In four years, when the next Ares crew
arrives, I'll have to be there.

317
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,833
Which means I have to get to the crater.

318
00:35:29,348 --> 00:35:31,242
Okay, so here's the rub.

319
00:35:31,342 --> 00:35:36,089
I've got one working Rover designed
to go a max distance of 35 kilometers

320
00:35:36,189 --> 00:35:39,951
before the battery has to be
recharged at the Hab.

321
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:41,577
That's Problem A.

322
00:35:42,378 --> 00:35:44,200
Problem B...

323
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,978
is this journey's gonna take me
roughly 50 days to complete.

324
00:35:49,078 --> 00:35:51,797
So I gotta live for 50 days

325
00:35:51,898 --> 00:35:56,518
inside a Rover with marginal life
support the size of a small van.

326
00:35:56,618 --> 00:35:58,004
So...

327
00:35:58,104 --> 00:36:02,042
in the face of overwhelming odds,
I'm left with only one option.

328
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:05,442
I'm gonna have to science
the shit out of this.

329
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,510
Okay, so, success.

330
00:36:36,336 --> 00:36:38,145
Uh...

331
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:44,396
I have doubled my battery life
by scavenging Rover 1.

332
00:36:45,087 --> 00:36:49,024
But... if I use the heater...

333
00:36:49,324 --> 00:36:54,623
I will burn through half
my battery every day.

334
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:59,678
If I do not use my heater, I will be...

335
00:37:00,278 --> 00:37:03,389
slowly killed by the laws
of thermodynamics.

336
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:08,930
I would love to solve this problem
right now but... unfortunately...

337
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,078
my balls are frozen.

338
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:16,391
I can't. I'm calling it. I'm calling it.

339
00:37:27,715 --> 00:37:31,111
Good news, I may have a solution
to my heating problem.

340
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:36,605
Bad news, it involves me digging up
the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator.

341
00:37:36,705 --> 00:37:40,638
Now, if I remember my training correctly,
one of the lessons was titled

342
00:37:40,738 --> 00:37:43,917
"Don't dig up the big box
of plutonium, Mark."

343
00:37:44,017 --> 00:37:48,154
I get it. RTGs are good for spacecraft,
but if they rupture around humans...

344
00:37:48,254 --> 00:37:51,808
no more humans, which is why
we buried it when we arrived.

345
00:37:51,908 --> 00:37:54,727
And planted that flag so we
would never be stupid enough

346
00:37:54,828 --> 00:37:57,089
to accidentally go near it again.

347
00:37:57,189 --> 00:38:00,067
But as long as I don't break it...

348
00:38:00,367 --> 00:38:02,987
I almost just said
"Everything will be fine" out loud.

349
00:38:03,087 --> 00:38:05,447
Look, the point is,
I'm not cold anymore.

350
00:38:05,547 --> 00:38:08,692
And sure, I could choose to think
about the fact that I'm warm

351
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:12,780
because I have a decaying
radioactive isotope riding right behind me

352
00:38:12,881 --> 00:38:15,133
but right now, I got
bigger problems on my hands.

353
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:20,063
I have scoured every single data file
on Commander Lewis' personal drive.

354
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:25,101
This is officially
the least disco song she owns.

355
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:29,465
<i>Lookin' for some hot stuff,
baby, this evenin'</i>

356
00:38:29,565 --> 00:38:33,349
<i>I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight</i>

357
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:37,974
<i>I want some hot stuff,
baby, this evenin'</i>

358
00:38:38,074 --> 00:38:42,078
<i>Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some love tonight</i>

359
00:38:42,178 --> 00:38:44,448
<i>Hot stuff</i>

360
00:38:45,398 --> 00:38:48,429
<i>I need hot stuff</i>

361
00:38:49,444 --> 00:38:51,866
<i>I want some hot stuff</i>

362
00:38:53,406 --> 00:38:56,344
<i>I need hot stuff...</i>

363
00:38:59,387 --> 00:39:00,798
- Yeah.
- Where is Watney going?

364
00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:03,301
We believe that he's preparing
for a journey.

365
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:05,487
He's been conducting incremental tests

366
00:39:05,587 --> 00:39:08,477
taking the Rover 2 out for longer
and longer trips each time.

367
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:10,674
Yeah?

368
00:39:10,774 --> 00:39:13,427
To what end? Why would he leave
the relative safety of the Hab?

369
00:39:13,527 --> 00:39:16,731
Well, we think that he plans to travel
to the Ares 4 launch site

370
00:39:16,832 --> 00:39:19,927
in order to make contact with us,
but it would be a dangerous gamble.

371
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:22,704
But if we could talk to him,
we would tell him to stay put

372
00:39:22,805 --> 00:39:27,351
and to trust that we are doing everything
in our power to bring him home alive.

373
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:29,194
Thank you very much.

374
00:39:31,972 --> 00:39:36,219
- Don't say "Bring him home alive," Vincent.
- You know, these interviews aren't easy.

375
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:39,873
So God forbid I try to say
something proactive and positive.

376
00:39:39,973 --> 00:39:43,093
- Annie.
- No more Vincent on TV. Copy that.

377
00:39:43,493 --> 00:39:46,471
76 kilometers. Am I reading that right?

378
00:39:46,972 --> 00:39:49,350
- Are you asking me?
- I am.

379
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,776
Yes, sir.

380
00:39:50,877 --> 00:39:54,847
Mark drove two hours straightaway
from the Hab, did a short EVA

381
00:39:54,947 --> 00:39:58,810
and then drove for another two.
We think the EVA was to change batteries.

382
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,721
He didn't load up the oxygenator
or the water reclaimer?

383
00:40:01,821 --> 00:40:04,156
Every 41 hours, there's a 17 minute gap.

384
00:40:04,256 --> 00:40:09,587
It's just the way the orbits work so...
it's possible that we missed something.

385
00:40:09,687 --> 00:40:11,539
I want that gap down to four minutes.

386
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:15,811
I'm giving you total authority over satellite
trajectories and orbital adjustments.

387
00:40:15,911 --> 00:40:18,864
- Make it happen.
- Okay.

388
00:40:18,964 --> 00:40:24,562
Let's assume Miss Park didn't miss anything.
So Mark's not going to Ares 4. Yet.

389
00:40:24,662 --> 00:40:28,137
But he's smart enough to figure out
that's his only chance.

390
00:40:28,237 --> 00:40:31,194
Bruce, what's the earliest
we can get a pre-supply there?

391
00:40:31,294 --> 00:40:34,105
Well, with the positions
of Earth and Mars,

392
00:40:34,205 --> 00:40:36,174
it'll take nine months.

393
00:40:36,274 --> 00:40:38,678
It'll take six months
to build it in the first place.

394
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:41,438
- Three months.
- Three? That's...

395
00:40:41,538 --> 00:40:42,956
You're going to say it's impossible

396
00:40:43,056 --> 00:40:46,710
and then I'm gonna make a speech about
the blinding capabilities of the JPL team

397
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:49,418
and then you're going to do the math
in your head and say something like,

398
00:40:49,518 --> 00:40:53,475
- "The overtime alone will be a nightmare."
- The overtime alone will be a nightmare.

399
00:40:53,575 --> 00:40:55,954
Get started. I'll find you the money.

400
00:40:57,355 --> 00:41:00,216
- We need to tell the crew.
- Mitch, we've discussed this.

401
00:41:00,316 --> 00:41:05,030
No, you discussed this. I'm the one
who decides what's best for the crew.

402
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:08,872
They deserve to know.

403
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:12,646
Once there's a real rescue plan,
we'll tell them, otherwise, it's moot.

404
00:41:13,047 --> 00:41:17,684
Bruce has three months to get the payload
done. That's all that matters right now.

405
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:21,781
- We'll do our best.
- Mark dies if you don't.

406
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,686
It's been 48 sols since
I planted the potatoes. So...

407
00:41:26,786 --> 00:41:29,156
now it's time to reap and re-sow.

408
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:31,524
They grew even better than I expected.

409
00:41:31,624 --> 00:41:35,095
I now have 400 healthy potato plants.

410
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:38,165
I dug them up, being careful
to leave their plants alive.

411
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:42,452
The smaller ones I'll reseed,
the larger ones are my food supply.

412
00:41:42,552 --> 00:41:46,174
All natural, organic,
Martian-grown potatoes.

413
00:41:46,274 --> 00:41:49,133
You don't hear that every day, do you?

414
00:41:49,233 --> 00:41:51,012
And by the way,
none of this matters at all

415
00:41:51,112 --> 00:41:54,687
if I can't figure out a way
to make contact with NASA.

416
00:42:15,796 --> 00:42:18,322
I know what I'm gonna do.

417
00:42:45,794 --> 00:42:49,674
- Oh! He's moving again.
- Where the hell is he going?

418
00:42:49,774 --> 00:42:54,012
He hasn't changed course for 13 days.
He's nowhere near the Ares 4.

419
00:42:54,612 --> 00:42:57,980
Well, unless he's not taking a direct route.
I mean, he might be trying to...

420
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,937
- avoid some obstacle.
- What obstacle?

421
00:43:02,387 --> 00:43:06,918
It's Acidalia Planitia.
There's nothing out there except the...

422
00:43:08,161 --> 00:43:09,914
What?

423
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:14,607
I need a map.

424
00:43:15,685 --> 00:43:19,096
Okay. Okay.

425
00:43:21,091 --> 00:43:22,767
Yeah.

426
00:43:22,868 --> 00:43:26,630
- Hey, come on, man. What are you doing?
- It's all right. Can I borrow this?

427
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:31,585
- Okay, so where is the Hab location?
- 31.2 degrees north, 28.5 degrees west.

428
00:43:31,685 --> 00:43:36,104
- Okay. Mmm-hmm. Where's Watney?
- Uh... There.

429
00:43:36,204 --> 00:43:38,032
Okay.

430
00:43:43,473 --> 00:43:45,085
Okay.

431
00:43:45,185 --> 00:43:48,029
I know where he's going.
I need to get on an airplane.

432
00:44:20,362 --> 00:44:23,473
- Vincent, how are you?
- Good to see you.

433
00:44:23,573 --> 00:44:25,994
- Good flight?
- Uh... Yeah.

434
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:29,370
It's in storage just around the corner.

435
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:06,136
- Hey, Vincent, nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you.

436
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:08,613
What are the chances Mark
can get it working again?

437
00:45:08,713 --> 00:45:12,224
It's hard to say.
We lost contact in '97.

438
00:45:12,324 --> 00:45:14,578
We think it was battery failure.

439
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:18,182
Though I'd like to point out it lasted
three times longer than expected...

440
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,876
Nobody's criticizing JPL's work, Bruce.

441
00:45:19,976 --> 00:45:21,969
I just need to speak to everybody
that was here in '97.

442
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:25,547
They're already here. Guys.
I'd like to introduce Vincent Kapoor.

443
00:45:25,647 --> 00:45:27,383
Director of Mars Missions for NASA.

444
00:45:27,483 --> 00:45:31,485
This is our current team...
and our original project members.

445
00:45:47,446 --> 00:45:48,797
- Is this the replica?
- This is her.

446
00:45:48,898 --> 00:45:50,992
Okay. Let's see it.

447
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,119
Pathfinder.

448
00:45:58,716 --> 00:46:00,068
Pathfinder.

449
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,853
Come on. Come on.

450
00:47:33,708 --> 00:47:36,145
Holy shit. Okay.

451
00:47:36,445 --> 00:47:38,998
"Broadcasting status.
Listening for telemetry signal."

452
00:47:39,098 --> 00:47:40,867
Uh-huh.

453
00:47:40,967 --> 00:47:43,253
Okay. Signal acquired.

454
00:47:44,645 --> 00:47:47,966
- All right.
- Okay. Camera.

455
00:48:36,784 --> 00:48:38,093
Incoming.

456
00:48:40,554 --> 00:48:43,716
"Are you receiving me?"

457
00:48:44,017 --> 00:48:46,120
"Yes. No."

458
00:48:48,063 --> 00:48:50,407
Okay, point the camera at "yes."

459
00:48:50,507 --> 00:48:52,918
32-minute round-trip
communications time.

460
00:48:53,018 --> 00:48:56,188
All he can do is ask yes or no questions
and all we can do is point the camera.

461
00:48:56,288 --> 00:48:59,102
This won't exactly be an Algonquin
Round Table of snappy repartee.

462
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:01,019
- Are you kidding me?
- Tim, Tim.

463
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,667
- Just point the camera.
- Roger that. Pointing the camera.

464
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:18,937
Whoo!

465
00:49:20,431 --> 00:49:22,291
Yes!

466
00:49:23,092 --> 00:49:24,902
Yes!

467
00:49:25,402 --> 00:49:27,679
So here's the rub.

468
00:49:27,779 --> 00:49:33,120
Somehow we have to have complex
astrophysical engineering conversations...

469
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,974
using nothing
but a still-frame camera...

470
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,633
from 1996.

471
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:43,964
Luckily...

472
00:49:45,165 --> 00:49:46,950
the camera does spin.

473
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,904
So I can make an alphabet.

474
00:49:50,004 --> 00:49:51,823
It can't be our alphabet.

475
00:49:51,923 --> 00:49:56,769
26 characters plus a question card
into 360 gives us 13 degrees of arc.

476
00:49:56,869 --> 00:50:01,115
That's way too narrow. I'd never know
what the camera was pointing at.

477
00:50:07,706 --> 00:50:09,579
Ooh.

478
00:50:13,487 --> 00:50:15,494
Hexadecimals.

479
00:50:19,118 --> 00:50:21,224
Hexadecimals to the rescue.

480
00:50:21,324 --> 00:50:24,991
I figured one of you guys
kept an ASCII table lying around.

481
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:30,663
And I was right. Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you super-nerd Beth Johanssen.

482
00:50:30,763 --> 00:50:33,708
Who also had copies of Zork II

483
00:50:33,809 --> 00:50:36,702
and Leather Goddesses of Phobos
on her personal laptop.

484
00:50:38,096 --> 00:50:42,418
Seriously, Johanssen, it's like
the Smithsonian of loneliness on there.

485
00:50:42,518 --> 00:50:44,245
Not that I'm complaining. Yes!

486
00:50:44,345 --> 00:50:46,957
Who am I to talk about loneliness?

487
00:51:06,776 --> 00:51:09,426
I know where he's going with this.

488
00:51:56,972 --> 00:51:59,282
"F, O."

489
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,866
"7, W."

490
00:52:19,146 --> 00:52:22,584
Vincent. Vincent, wake up.

491
00:52:33,937 --> 00:52:36,543
Now that we can have more
complicated conversations

492
00:52:36,643 --> 00:52:39,333
the smart people at NASA
have sent me instructions

493
00:52:39,433 --> 00:52:43,017
on how to hack the Rover
so that it can talk to Pathfinder.

494
00:52:43,117 --> 00:52:47,918
If I hack a tiny bit of code just 20
instructions in the Rover's operating system

495
00:52:48,018 --> 00:52:52,264
NASA can link the Rover to Pathfinder's
broadcasting frequency

496
00:52:52,364 --> 00:52:54,601
and we're in business.

497
00:53:08,444 --> 00:53:11,810
"Mark, this is Vincent Kapoor.

498
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:15,194
"We've been watching you since Sol 54.

499
00:53:16,372 --> 00:53:19,509
"The whole world is rooting for you.

500
00:53:19,609 --> 00:53:23,064
"Amazing job getting Pathfinder.

501
00:53:23,164 --> 00:53:25,191
"We're working on rescue plans.

502
00:53:25,641 --> 00:53:28,752
"Meantime, we're putting together
a supply mission

503
00:53:28,853 --> 00:53:30,749
"to keep you fed...

504
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:34,690
"until Ares 4 arrives."

505
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:52,354
Okay.

506
00:54:01,562 --> 00:54:05,641
Okay. "Glad to hear it.
Really looking forward to not dying."

507
00:54:18,263 --> 00:54:22,184
"How's the crew? What did they say
when they found out I was alive?"

508
00:54:43,465 --> 00:54:45,726
Guys, can we get some space please?

509
00:54:46,227 --> 00:54:48,304
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

510
00:54:48,404 --> 00:54:50,664
Just give me a sec.

511
00:54:56,262 --> 00:54:58,331
Just tell him.

512
00:55:06,331 --> 00:55:09,645
"We haven't told the crew...

513
00:55:09,745 --> 00:55:12,203
"you are alive yet.

514
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:18,243
"We need them to concentrate
on their mission."

515
00:55:31,075 --> 00:55:33,476
What the fuck?

516
00:55:34,203 --> 00:55:36,281
What the fuck?

517
00:55:42,611 --> 00:55:45,364
Okay, he says,
"They don't know I'm alive?

518
00:55:45,464 --> 00:55:48,501
"What the" F-word.
F-word in gerund form.

519
00:55:48,601 --> 00:55:51,629
F-word, again, "is wrong with you?"

520
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:56,417
"Mark, please watch your language.

521
00:55:56,517 --> 00:56:02,603
"Everything you type is being
broadcast live all over the world."

522
00:56:05,377 --> 00:56:07,213
Yeah?

523
00:56:14,786 --> 00:56:17,082
Oh, my God.

524
00:56:18,365 --> 00:56:22,042
Yes, sir. He is under
a tremendous amount of stress.

525
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,766
I understand. We're working on it.
I'm sure he didn't mean what he said.

526
00:56:26,867 --> 00:56:29,336
Thank you, Mr. President.

527
00:56:30,578 --> 00:56:34,391
Problem is, Mark's right. The longer
we wait, the worse it's gonna get.

528
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:35,676
We need to tell the crew.

529
00:56:35,776 --> 00:56:39,856
You're bringing this up while Vincent is in
Pasadena so he can't argue the other side.

530
00:56:39,956 --> 00:56:43,813
I shouldn't have to answer to Vincent.
Or anyone else.

531
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,096
It's time, Teddy.

532
00:57:11,106 --> 00:57:14,592
- Commander Lewis?
- Go ahead.

533
00:57:14,692 --> 00:57:17,103
Data dump is almost complete.

534
00:57:17,203 --> 00:57:19,367
Copy that. On my way.

535
00:57:32,253 --> 00:57:35,091
- You're in a hurry.
- Yeah.

536
00:57:35,191 --> 00:57:39,464
My son turned three yesterday.
Should be pictures of the party.

537
00:57:49,734 --> 00:57:54,554
Got a batch of personals.
Dispatching them to your laptops now.

538
00:57:54,968 --> 00:57:58,364
I don't need to read Vogel's
weird German fetish emails.

539
00:57:58,464 --> 00:58:02,576
- They're telemetry updates.
- Hey, whatever does it for you, man.

540
00:58:02,676 --> 00:58:06,764
Oh, there's a video message.
It's addressed to the whole crew.

541
00:58:06,865 --> 00:58:08,774
Play it. Come on, guys.

542
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:11,085
I wanna get in on that telemetry action.

543
00:58:14,965 --> 00:58:18,318
Hi, hello. It's Mitch. Mitch Henderson.

544
00:58:18,418 --> 00:58:22,931
I have some news.
There's no subtle way to put this.

545
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:27,669
- Mark Watney is still alive.
- Oh, my God.

546
00:58:27,769 --> 00:58:31,424
I know that's a surprise and I know
you will have a lot of questions.

547
00:58:31,825 --> 00:58:34,485
But here are the basics. He's...

548
00:58:34,585 --> 00:58:37,080
He's alive and he's healthy.

549
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:42,477
We... we found out two months ago
and decided not to tell you.

550
00:58:42,577 --> 00:58:43,937
- Two months?
- Oh, my God.

551
00:58:44,137 --> 00:58:46,573
I was strongly against that decision.

552
00:58:46,673 --> 00:58:49,663
We're telling you now because...

553
00:58:49,763 --> 00:58:52,346
we finally have
communication with him...

554
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:55,374
and a viable rescue plan.

555
00:58:55,474 --> 00:58:59,261
We'll give you a write-up of what happened,
a full write-up of everything.

556
00:58:59,361 --> 00:59:03,560
But it's not your fault. Mark
stresses that every time it comes up.

557
00:59:04,818 --> 00:59:07,855
So... yeah.

558
00:59:09,247 --> 00:59:11,591
Take some time to absorb this.

559
00:59:11,691 --> 00:59:16,342
And send all the questions you want.
We'll answer them.

560
00:59:17,323 --> 00:59:20,894
- All right. Henderson out.
- Holy shit, he's alive.

561
00:59:22,095 --> 00:59:23,671
- I left him behind.
- No.

562
00:59:23,771 --> 00:59:26,149
No. We all left together.

563
00:59:26,249 --> 00:59:28,777
You were following orders.

564
00:59:31,704 --> 00:59:33,549
I left him behind.

565
00:59:43,058 --> 00:59:46,070
So now that NASA can talk to me,
they won't shut up.

566
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:49,123
They want constant updates
on every Hab system

567
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:53,036
and they got a room full of people
trying to micromanage my crops.

568
00:59:53,136 --> 00:59:55,263
Which is awesome.

569
00:59:55,363 --> 00:59:58,542
Look, I don't mean to sound arrogant
or anything but I am...

570
00:59:58,642 --> 01:00:02,909
the greatest botanist
on this planet, so...

571
01:00:03,696 --> 01:00:07,539
Oh, one big bonus to this communication
with NASA again, is the email.

572
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:11,105
I'm getting them again. Big data dumps
like when I was on the Hermes.

573
01:00:11,205 --> 01:00:13,049
I even got one from the president.

574
01:00:13,149 --> 01:00:15,617
The coolest one, though,
the coolest one I got

575
01:00:15,717 --> 01:00:18,403
was from University of Chicago,
my Alma mater.

576
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:24,002
They say that once you grow crops
somewhere you've officially colonized it.

577
01:00:24,102 --> 01:00:26,959
So, technically...

578
01:00:27,497 --> 01:00:30,131
I colonized Mars.

579
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:36,481
In your face, Neil Armstrong.

580
01:00:36,581 --> 01:00:40,469
In other news, there's been a request
for me to pose for a photograph

581
01:00:40,569 --> 01:00:42,907
on my next transmission.

582
01:00:43,372 --> 01:00:47,643
I'm trying to figure out whether
I should go with "High School Senior"

583
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:52,214
or "coquettish ingenue." But...

584
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:55,370
I'm not really sure how that's
gonna look with my spacesuit on.

585
01:01:21,796 --> 01:01:23,874
Hey!

586
01:01:25,491 --> 01:01:29,096
What is he doing? I asked for a photo,
and what, he's The Fonz?

587
01:01:29,196 --> 01:01:31,132
Just be grateful
we got you something, Annie.

588
01:01:31,232 --> 01:01:34,460
I can't use this, Vincent, and you know that.
I need a picture of his face.

589
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,997
Well, I could tell him to take off his helmet
but then he'd, you know, die, so...

590
01:01:39,581 --> 01:01:41,901
We'll release the photo
when we detail the rescue operation.

591
01:01:42,001 --> 01:01:45,230
I want to announce we're launching
some supplies to him next year

592
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:47,240
during the Hohmann Transfer Window.

593
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:51,736
- Bruce, your team's still on schedule?
- It'll be tight, but we'll make it.

594
01:01:51,837 --> 01:01:56,016
Nine-month travel time.
That puts the probe to Mars on Sol 868.

595
01:01:56,116 --> 01:01:57,750
Did we get the botany team's analysis?

596
01:01:57,851 --> 01:02:01,305
Yeah, they estimate Mark's crops
will last till Sol 912.

597
01:02:01,405 --> 01:02:04,150
They grudgingly admit
that he's doing great work.

598
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:06,487
- Grudgingly?
- Yeah. Mark has a tendency to tell them

599
01:02:06,587 --> 01:02:09,697
to have sex with themselves whenever
they question one of his decisions.

600
01:02:09,797 --> 01:02:12,901
Get him in line, Vincent.
We can't afford any miscommunication.

601
01:02:13,001 --> 01:02:18,659
I hate this margin. 912 Sols
worth of food. We get there on 868.

602
01:02:19,074 --> 01:02:21,777
And that's assuming nothing goes wrong.

603
01:03:06,774 --> 01:03:09,420
Suit breach detected.

604
01:03:16,969 --> 01:03:19,983
Oxygen level critical.

605
01:03:33,086 --> 01:03:36,483
Oxygen level, 10%.

606
01:03:50,404 --> 01:03:53,746
Oxygen level, 5%.

607
01:04:02,458 --> 01:04:05,450
Suit pressure, stable.

608
01:06:00,275 --> 01:06:02,695
Pressure stable.

609
01:06:35,688 --> 01:06:39,301
God! God, God, God, God!

610
01:06:57,603 --> 01:06:59,471
Crops are dead.

611
01:06:59,571 --> 01:07:01,808
Complete loss of pressure
boiled off most of the water.

612
01:07:01,908 --> 01:07:04,977
Any bacteria that survived,
died in the subzero temperatures

613
01:07:05,077 --> 01:07:07,238
when exposed to Mars' atmosphere.

614
01:07:07,338 --> 01:07:09,516
How long does he have?

615
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:14,296
He can still eat the potatoes he has,
he just can't grow any more, so...

616
01:07:14,396 --> 01:07:16,849
get him 200 sols.

617
01:07:17,149 --> 01:07:20,013
Rations get him to what? Sol 409?

618
01:07:20,113 --> 01:07:23,138
Mmm-hmm. So with potatoes, 609.

619
01:07:23,238 --> 01:07:25,959
So by Sol 868, he'll be long dead.

620
01:07:26,059 --> 01:07:30,591
We're gonna have to launch as soon
as possible which changes our travel time.

621
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:33,374
Yeah, we're working on it.

622
01:07:33,474 --> 01:07:37,710
Prelim estimates call
for a 414-day trip.

623
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,257
It's Sol 135 now.

624
01:07:40,357 --> 01:07:42,426
We need 13 days to mount the boosters,

625
01:07:42,526 --> 01:07:46,780
perform inspections which gives
Bruce and his team...

626
01:07:47,281 --> 01:07:50,393
47 days to make this probe.

627
01:07:50,826 --> 01:07:54,039
I'll let you call Bruce,
give him the news.

628
01:07:57,258 --> 01:07:59,064
Okay.

629
01:08:01,779 --> 01:08:04,164
I'm gonna need a change of clothes.

630
01:08:12,809 --> 01:08:15,027
"Dear Mark...

631
01:08:15,127 --> 01:08:20,434
"Apparently... NASA's letting us
talk to you now.

632
01:08:21,025 --> 01:08:24,386
"And I drew the short straw.

633
01:08:28,207 --> 01:08:31,837
"Sorry we left you behind on Mars.

634
01:08:32,237 --> 01:08:35,023
"But we just don't like you.

635
01:08:36,925 --> 01:08:42,083
"Also, it's a lot roomier
on the Hermes without you.

636
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:46,169
"We have to take turns doing your tasks.

637
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:50,460
"But, I mean, it's only botany.

638
01:08:51,624 --> 01:08:54,768
- "It's not real science."
- Oh, Jesus.

639
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:58,410
"How's Mars?"

640
01:09:01,911 --> 01:09:06,473
"Dear Martinez, Mars is fine.

641
01:09:06,573 --> 01:09:09,406
"I accidentally blew up the Hab

642
01:09:09,506 --> 01:09:14,241
"but unfortunately,
all of Commander Lewis' disco music

643
01:09:14,341 --> 01:09:15,912
"still survived."

644
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:21,289
"But unfortunately, all of Commander
Lewis' disco music still survived."

645
01:09:21,389 --> 01:09:26,677
"Every day, I go outside
and look at the vast horizons."

646
01:09:26,777 --> 01:09:30,473
"Every day, I go outside
and look at the vast horizons."

647
01:09:30,573 --> 01:09:32,625
"Just because I can."

648
01:09:32,725 --> 01:09:34,896
"Just because I can.

649
01:09:34,996 --> 01:09:38,188
"Tell the others I said hello."

650
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:43,054
"Will do, buddy."

651
01:11:12,357 --> 01:11:14,837
Pressure stable.

652
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:56,753
5, 10...

653
01:11:56,854 --> 01:12:00,926
15, 20, 30, 35...

654
01:12:01,026 --> 01:12:02,102
40.

655
01:12:02,903 --> 01:12:04,820
52.

656
01:12:32,993 --> 01:12:34,828
Rich.

657
01:12:35,528 --> 01:12:38,290
Rich. Wake up.

658
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:42,577
Sorry, but they're asking
for the probe courses.

659
01:12:42,677 --> 01:12:46,539
- What time is it?
- It's 3:42.

660
01:12:51,587 --> 01:12:54,073
Look, I know we're coming
at this backwards

661
01:12:54,173 --> 01:12:57,260
but we can't commit to a firm launch
date with this many unknowns.

662
01:12:58,361 --> 01:13:00,213
It's all right. Um...

663
01:13:00,313 --> 01:13:03,049
All 25 models for launch
will take 414 days to reach Mars.

664
01:13:03,149 --> 01:13:06,732
They vary slightly in thrust duration and
the fuel requirement is nearly identical.

665
01:13:08,088 --> 01:13:10,115
Not a good time to launch, is it?

666
01:13:10,215 --> 01:13:13,135
Yeah, Earth and Mars
are really badly positioned.

667
01:13:13,235 --> 01:13:15,956
Heck, it'd almost be easier
if you, um...

668
01:13:17,948 --> 01:13:20,442
Almost easier to what?

669
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:22,829
I need more coffee.

670
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:26,701
- Are you all right?
- It's fine.

671
01:13:30,711 --> 01:13:33,107
Almost easier to what?

672
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:46,480
You do understand I'm your boss, right?

673
01:13:46,703 --> 01:13:48,490
Uh-huh.

674
01:13:51,475 --> 01:13:55,780
All right, let's ask the very,
very expensive question.

675
01:13:55,881 --> 01:13:58,416
- Is the probe going to be ready on time?
- We're behind.

676
01:13:58,516 --> 01:14:02,537
- Give me a number.
- 15 days. 15 days and I can get it done.

677
01:14:02,637 --> 01:14:07,284
All right, let's create 15 days. 13 days
to mount the probe. Can we reduce?

678
01:14:07,384 --> 01:14:09,712
It actually only takes
three days to mount the probe.

679
01:14:09,813 --> 01:14:13,141
- And we can get that down to two, right?
- I can get it down to two.

680
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:14,951
10 days are for tests and inspections.

681
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:18,288
How often do those inspections
reveal a problem?

682
01:14:18,388 --> 01:14:20,314
Are you suggesting
we don't do the inspections?

683
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:22,834
Right now I'm asking how often
they reveal a problem.

684
01:14:23,034 --> 01:14:24,110
One in 20.

685
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,997
- But that's grounds for countdown halt.
- We can't take that chance.

686
01:14:27,097 --> 01:14:30,663
Anyone else know a safer way
to buy more time?

687
01:14:33,971 --> 01:14:36,256
Dr. Keller, stretch Watney's rations
four more days.

688
01:14:36,356 --> 01:14:39,515
You're not gonna like it, but that'll get us
to 15. And we'll cancel the inspections.

689
01:14:39,615 --> 01:14:41,664
- Teddy.
- Sir, if that ever got out...

690
01:14:41,764 --> 01:14:46,055
It's on me. You got your two weeks.
Get it done.

691
01:14:46,551 --> 01:14:50,630
So, now I have to hold out until
the probe gets here with more food.

692
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:54,851
You want to see what minimal calorie
count looks like? Standard issue ration.

693
01:14:54,951 --> 01:14:59,048
But instead of three of these
every one day...

694
01:14:59,148 --> 01:15:03,108
I'm now eating one of these
every three days.

695
01:15:04,453 --> 01:15:07,164
And now, they've asked me...

696
01:15:07,264 --> 01:15:08,315
to do that.

697
01:15:13,212 --> 01:15:15,276
The point is...

698
01:15:15,808 --> 01:15:19,328
"stretch the rations four more days..."

699
01:15:19,937 --> 01:15:22,372
is a real dick-punch.

700
01:15:25,608 --> 01:15:28,907
I'm gonna dip this potato
in some crushed Vicodin.

701
01:15:29,948 --> 01:15:32,217
And there's nobody who can stop me.

702
01:15:42,485 --> 01:15:46,116
It has been seven days
since I ran out of ketchup.

703
01:15:57,584 --> 01:16:00,329
Up. Up, up. Yeah.

704
01:16:00,429 --> 01:16:02,456
Let's go up here.

705
01:16:02,556 --> 01:16:04,944
Labels facing up.

706
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:11,892
This is the flight director.
Begin launch status check.

707
01:16:11,992 --> 01:16:14,702
Roger that, Flight.
Beginning launch status check.

708
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:17,210
Do you believe in God, Vincent?

709
01:16:18,231 --> 01:16:20,026
Yeah.

710
01:16:20,126 --> 01:16:24,313
Yeah, my father was a Hindu,
my mother's a Baptist, so yeah...

711
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,759
I believe in several.

712
01:16:28,734 --> 01:16:30,502
We'll take all the help we can get.

713
01:16:30,602 --> 01:16:32,529
Launch status check complete.

714
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:35,608
This is Flight. We are go for launch.

715
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:36,789
Proceeding with the count.

716
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:41,175
10, 9, 8, 7, 6...

717
01:16:41,275 --> 01:16:42,878
Main engines start.

718
01:16:42,978 --> 01:16:47,537
4, 3, 2, 1.

719
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:49,819
Liftoff.

720
01:16:51,826 --> 01:16:53,957
Good thrust.

721
01:16:57,306 --> 01:16:59,532
Performance is nominal.

722
01:17:12,456 --> 01:17:14,523
The tail is giving good data.

723
01:17:15,725 --> 01:17:18,879
She's rock solid at this point, Flight.
TVCs look good.

724
01:17:30,533 --> 01:17:32,886
We're getting a little shimmy, Flight.

725
01:17:32,986 --> 01:17:34,704
Say again?

726
01:17:34,805 --> 01:17:38,774
- We are getting a very large precession.
- Are we good?

727
01:17:39,409 --> 01:17:40,665
Flight, it's hitting the redline.

728
01:17:40,765 --> 01:17:44,498
It's spinning on the long axis
around a 17-degree precession.

729
01:17:45,049 --> 01:17:48,702
- Launch, what's happening?
- Force on Iris is 7 G's.

730
01:17:48,803 --> 01:17:51,738
We've lost readings
on the probe, Flight.

731
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,064
Oh, Jesus Christ.

732
01:18:00,515 --> 01:18:02,890
We've lost it, Flight.

733
01:18:05,762 --> 01:18:06,880
SatCon?

734
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:09,632
No satellite acquisition of signal.

735
01:18:11,927 --> 01:18:14,538
- L.O.S.
- L.O.S. here, too.

736
01:18:14,638 --> 01:18:18,284
U.S. Destroyer Stockton reporting
debris falling from the sky.

737
01:18:18,384 --> 01:18:20,970
Everyone in the LCC,
maintain your positions...

738
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:23,435
GC, lock the doors.

739
01:18:52,028 --> 01:18:54,072
"Commander Lewis...

740
01:18:54,172 --> 01:18:58,226
"I may need you to do something for me.

741
01:18:59,127 --> 01:19:01,185
"If I die...

742
01:19:01,285 --> 01:19:04,673
"I need you to check in on my parents.

743
01:19:05,376 --> 01:19:09,240
"They'll wanna hear all about
our time here on Mars.

744
01:19:10,256 --> 01:19:12,283
"I know that sucks.

745
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:16,412
"And it'll be hard talking
to a couple...

746
01:19:16,512 --> 01:19:18,665
"about their dead son.

747
01:19:19,867 --> 01:19:22,372
"It's a lot to ask.

748
01:19:24,221 --> 01:19:27,299
"Which is why I'm asking you.

749
01:19:27,399 --> 01:19:29,309
"I'm not giving up.

750
01:19:29,409 --> 01:19:34,212
"We just need to prepare
for every outcome.

751
01:19:36,092 --> 01:19:37,833
"Please tell them...

752
01:19:40,138 --> 01:19:42,927
"Tell them I love what I do...

753
01:19:46,419 --> 01:19:48,994
"and I'm really good at it.

754
01:19:50,324 --> 01:19:53,914
"And that I'm dying...

755
01:19:54,678 --> 01:19:57,947
"for something big...

756
01:19:58,782 --> 01:20:00,749
"and beautiful...

757
01:20:04,729 --> 01:20:07,067
"and greater than me.

758
01:20:08,518 --> 01:20:11,894
"Tell them I said I can live with that.

759
01:20:12,463 --> 01:20:14,941
"And tell them...

760
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:19,104
"thank you for being my mom and dad."

761
01:20:20,889 --> 01:20:24,443
We substituted protein cubes
for the standard rations.

762
01:20:24,543 --> 01:20:28,530
The thrust of the launch combined
with the simultaneous lateral vibration

763
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:33,185
liquefied the cubes and created
an unbalanced load.

764
01:20:33,285 --> 01:20:36,438
Vincent, why wasn't this addressed
in the inspections phase?

765
01:20:36,538 --> 01:20:40,691
In order to make our launch window,
we were forced to accelerate our schedule.

766
01:20:41,722 --> 01:20:43,807
Their astronaut is going to die.

767
01:20:45,784 --> 01:20:47,686
Of course there are other ways...

768
01:20:49,255 --> 01:20:52,816
the Taiyang Shen booster.
Our engineers have run the numbers,

769
01:20:52,916 --> 01:20:55,739
and it has enough fuel
for a Mars injection orbit.

770
01:20:56,737 --> 01:20:58,238
Why hasn't NASA approached us?

771
01:20:58,338 --> 01:21:00,015
They don't know.

772
01:21:00,115 --> 01:21:02,734
Our booster technology is classified.

773
01:21:04,962 --> 01:21:08,707
So if we do nothing...

774
01:21:08,807 --> 01:21:13,553
The world would never know
we could have helped.

775
01:21:13,937 --> 01:21:19,125
Then, for the sake of argument,
let's say we decide to help them...

776
01:21:19,343 --> 01:21:23,413
We'd be giving up a booster
and effectively canceling Taiyang Shen.

777
01:21:24,348 --> 01:21:29,536
We need to keep this among scientists,
a co-operation between space agencies.

778
01:21:32,532 --> 01:21:34,297
Yes.

779
01:21:35,051 --> 01:21:37,648
Yes, I understand.

780
01:21:39,831 --> 01:21:41,655
Thank you.

781
01:21:44,829 --> 01:21:46,634
Yes!

782
01:21:47,431 --> 01:21:51,978
All right. Thanks to my uncle Tommy
in China, we get another chance at this.

783
01:21:52,078 --> 01:21:55,072
Now, we finished
the Iris probe in 62 days.

784
01:21:55,172 --> 01:21:58,508
We are now gonna attempt
to finish it in 28.

785
01:22:23,702 --> 01:22:26,612
We can jettison any kind of landing system.
We're only sending rations.

786
01:22:26,712 --> 01:22:29,742
We can... we can crash-land on Mars.

787
01:22:30,443 --> 01:22:32,892
- You should hang up the phone.
- I'm sorry, who are you?

788
01:22:32,992 --> 01:22:37,317
Rich Purnell. I work in Astrodynamics,
and you should hang up the phone right now.

789
01:22:38,685 --> 01:22:42,460
All right, all right.
I'm gonna call you back.

790
01:22:42,873 --> 01:22:45,330
I know how to save Mark Watney.

791
01:22:45,976 --> 01:22:48,513
Your probe plan won't work.
Too many things can go wrong.

792
01:22:48,613 --> 01:22:50,966
- I've got a better way.
- Astrodynamics?

793
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:52,650
Yeah.

794
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:55,281
What the hell is "Project Elrond"?

795
01:22:55,581 --> 01:22:58,131
- I had to make something up.
- But "Elrond"?

796
01:22:58,731 --> 01:23:00,716
Because it's a secret meeting.

797
01:23:00,817 --> 01:23:03,494
How do you know that?
Why does "Elrond" mean "secret meeting"?

798
01:23:03,594 --> 01:23:06,223
The Council of Elrond.
It's from Lord of the Rings.

799
01:23:06,546 --> 01:23:09,551
It's the meeting where they decide
to destroy the One Ring.

800
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:11,578
If we're gonna call something
"Project Elrond"

801
01:23:11,678 --> 01:23:13,998
I would like my code name
to be "Glorfindel."

802
01:23:14,098 --> 01:23:16,050
Okay, I hate every one of you.

803
01:23:16,150 --> 01:23:18,585
What, Teddy doesn't even
know about this yet?

804
01:23:18,685 --> 01:23:22,682
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- This is Rich Purnell, Astrodynamics.

805
01:23:22,782 --> 01:23:24,509
Tell them what you just told me.

806
01:23:24,609 --> 01:23:28,363
I can get the Hermes
back to Mars by Sol 561.

807
01:23:29,464 --> 01:23:31,237
How?

808
01:23:34,677 --> 01:23:37,481
Could you stand
right there for me, please?

809
01:23:38,908 --> 01:23:41,160
Thanks. Right there. Great.

810
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:45,831
And could you stand right there?
Right there.

811
01:23:49,928 --> 01:23:53,874
Okay, let's pretend
that this stapler is the Hermes

812
01:23:53,974 --> 01:23:56,476
and you are...

813
01:23:56,576 --> 01:24:01,173
- I'm sorry, what's your name again?
- Teddy. I'm the Director of NASA.

814
01:24:01,673 --> 01:24:03,834
Cool. Teddy, you're Earth.

815
01:24:03,934 --> 01:24:06,070
Right now, the Hermes
is headed towards you

816
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:08,730
starting its month-long deceleration
to intercept.

817
01:24:08,831 --> 01:24:12,641
But instead, what I'm proposing is...

818
01:24:15,538 --> 01:24:19,475
we start accelerating immediately
to preserve velocity and gain even more.

819
01:24:19,575 --> 01:24:22,162
We don't intercept with Earth at all
but we come close enough

820
01:24:22,262 --> 01:24:24,655
to get a gravity assist
and adjust course.

821
01:24:24,755 --> 01:24:27,334
While we're doing that...

822
01:24:28,803 --> 01:24:31,630
- we resupply with the probe...
- The Taiyang Shen.

823
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:36,444
...pick up whatever provisions we need
and now we're accelerating towards Mars.

824
01:24:38,262 --> 01:24:39,671
You're Mars.

825
01:24:39,771 --> 01:24:44,166
Now, we're going too fast at this point
to fall into orbit but... we can do a flyby.

826
01:24:44,266 --> 01:24:47,327
What good is a flyby if we can't
get Watney off the surface?

827
01:24:47,427 --> 01:24:50,505
Watney would intercept using the MAV.

828
01:24:50,605 --> 01:24:52,282
Ow!

829
01:24:54,818 --> 01:24:57,188
And then we just head home.

830
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:04,846
I've done the math. It checks out.

831
01:25:05,646 --> 01:25:06,906
- Rich.
- Yes, sir.

832
01:25:07,006 --> 01:25:09,599
- Get out.
- All right.

833
01:25:15,607 --> 01:25:17,284
- Is he right?
- Yeah.

834
01:25:17,584 --> 01:25:20,212
Bruce, what do you think?

835
01:25:20,312 --> 01:25:23,073
Well, if Vincent says so.

836
01:25:23,173 --> 01:25:26,618
- We need to use the Taiyang Shen?
- Uh-huh.

837
01:25:26,718 --> 01:25:29,989
- What am I missing? Why is that important?
- Because we can only do one.

838
01:25:30,089 --> 01:25:32,400
Send Watney enough food
to last till Ares 4

839
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,385
or send Hermes back
to get him right now.

840
01:25:34,485 --> 01:25:38,606
Both plans require the Taiyang Shen,
so we have to choose.

841
01:25:38,706 --> 01:25:41,910
But what about the Hermes crew?
We'd be asking them to add

842
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:45,013
533 extra days to their mission.

843
01:25:45,113 --> 01:25:47,750
Yeah. They wouldn't hesitate,
not for a second.

844
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:51,353
Can the Hermes function for 533 days
beyond the scheduled mission end?

845
01:25:51,453 --> 01:25:54,490
It should. Built to last
the full Ares mission

846
01:25:54,591 --> 01:25:57,218
so technically, it's only
halfway through its lifespan.

847
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:59,929
- But if something goes wrong
- Then we lose the crew.

848
01:26:00,029 --> 01:26:03,150
So what? We either have
a high chance of killing one person

849
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:06,724
or a low chance of killing six people.

850
01:26:06,824 --> 01:26:08,205
How do we make that decision?

851
01:26:08,505 --> 01:26:11,166
We don't have to make it, Bruce.
He does.

852
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:15,120
Yeah, well, bullshit.
It should be Commander Lewis' call.

853
01:26:15,220 --> 01:26:18,348
We still have a chance to bring
five astronauts home safe and sound.

854
01:26:18,448 --> 01:26:21,119
I'm not risking their lives.

855
01:26:21,219 --> 01:26:23,705
Let them make that decision.

856
01:26:23,805 --> 01:26:27,570
Mitch, we're going with option one.

857
01:26:28,442 --> 01:26:30,221
You goddamn coward.

858
01:26:48,655 --> 01:26:51,116
- Johanssen?
- Yeah.

859
01:26:51,216 --> 01:26:53,679
I know it's your private time.
Can I bother you for a second?

860
01:26:53,779 --> 01:26:54,921
Yeah, go ahead.

861
01:26:55,021 --> 01:26:57,668
- Where are you?
- The gym.

862
01:27:18,896 --> 01:27:20,948
- What's up?
- I just got an email from my wife

863
01:27:21,048 --> 01:27:24,619
and the subject line says,
"Our children."

864
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:27,590
My computer won't open the attachment.

865
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:30,493
Okay. Let's take a look.

866
01:27:34,379 --> 01:27:36,140
Uh...

867
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:39,101
Let's see.

868
01:27:39,977 --> 01:27:42,336
This isn't a JPEG.

869
01:27:42,781 --> 01:27:46,217
It's a plain ASCII text file.

870
01:27:48,044 --> 01:27:51,147
I don't really know
what we're looking at. It's...

871
01:27:51,947 --> 01:27:54,142
Does that make any sense to you?

872
01:27:54,634 --> 01:27:56,937
"Rich Purnell Maneuver."

873
01:27:57,037 --> 01:28:01,267
It's a... course maneuver
for the Hermes.

874
01:28:05,395 --> 01:28:10,117
And the mission concludes
with Earth intercept, 211 days later.

875
01:28:10,517 --> 01:28:11,911
Would it work?

876
01:28:12,011 --> 01:28:14,280
Mmm-hmm. We ran the numbers.
They check out.

877
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:15,907
It's a brilliant course.

878
01:28:16,007 --> 01:28:18,770
So why all the cloak and dagger?

879
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:20,871
Because it goes directly
against NASA's decision.

880
01:28:20,971 --> 01:28:24,950
Yeah. If we do the maneuver, they'd have
to send the supply ship or we die.

881
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:28,663
We have the opportunity
to force their hand.

882
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:32,859
So, are we gonna do it?

883
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,402
If it was up to me,
we'd already be on our way.

884
01:28:35,502 --> 01:28:38,064
But it is, though, isn't it? Up to you.

885
01:28:38,164 --> 01:28:42,860
Not this time. This is something
NASA expressly rejected.

886
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:46,481
We're talking about mutiny here,
which is not a word that I take lightly.

887
01:28:46,581 --> 01:28:49,359
So we do this together or not at all.

888
01:28:49,459 --> 01:28:52,387
And before you answer,
consider the consequences.

889
01:28:52,487 --> 01:28:55,515
If we mess up the supply
rendezvous, we die.

890
01:28:55,716 --> 01:28:58,493
If we mess up the Earth
gravity assist, we die.

891
01:28:58,593 --> 01:29:00,881
If we do everything perfectly

892
01:29:00,981 --> 01:29:04,915
we add 533 days to our mission.

893
01:29:05,368 --> 01:29:09,030
533 more days before we see
our families again.

894
01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:12,413
533 days

895
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:15,328
of unplanned space travel
where anything could go wrong.

896
01:29:15,528 --> 01:29:18,201
If it's mission critical,

897
01:29:18,301 --> 01:29:20,676
- we die.
- Sign me up.

898
01:29:20,776 --> 01:29:22,494
All right, cowboy, slow down.

899
01:29:22,594 --> 01:29:25,353
You and I, we're military.
Chances are, we go home,

900
01:29:25,453 --> 01:29:27,132
- they'll court martial us.
- Yeah, there's that.

901
01:29:27,232 --> 01:29:31,320
And for the rest of you guys I guarantee
they will never send you back up here again.

902
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:36,159
Good. So, if we go for it,
how would it work?

903
01:29:36,259 --> 01:29:39,287
- I plot the course and execute it.
- Remote override.

904
01:29:39,387 --> 01:29:42,616
They could take over the Hermes
from Mission Control.

905
01:29:43,066 --> 01:29:45,001
Can you disable it?

906
01:29:45,101 --> 01:29:47,320
Hermes has four redundant
flight computers

907
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:49,940
each connected to three
redundant comm systems.

908
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,819
We can't shut down the comms because
we'd lose telemetry and guidance.

909
01:29:52,919 --> 01:29:56,288
And we can't shut down the computers
because we need to run the ship.

910
01:29:56,388 --> 01:29:59,651
I'd have to disable
remote override on each system.

911
01:29:59,751 --> 01:30:01,894
It's part of the OS,
I'd have to jump over the code.

912
01:30:01,994 --> 01:30:04,536
Okay, but, like, in English,
what would that mean?

913
01:30:06,733 --> 01:30:08,910
I can do it.

914
01:30:09,011 --> 01:30:10,841
Great.

915
01:30:11,604 --> 01:30:13,824
Well, it has to be unanimous.

916
01:30:13,924 --> 01:30:19,197
If we do this,
it'll be over 900 days of space.

917
01:30:21,089 --> 01:30:25,036
That's more than enough space
for one life, so...

918
01:30:25,436 --> 01:30:28,191
- yes.
- I vote yes.

919
01:30:30,599 --> 01:30:32,998
Let's go get him.

920
01:30:35,121 --> 01:30:36,915
Johanssen?

921
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:39,138
- Yes.
- Yeah!

922
01:30:41,712 --> 01:30:44,339
Got an unscheduled
status update from Hermes.

923
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:46,333
- Roger. Read it out.
- Message reads,

924
01:30:46,433 --> 01:30:50,212
"Houston, please be advised.
Rich Purnell is a steely-eyed missile man."

925
01:30:50,312 --> 01:30:51,430
What?

926
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:54,560
Flight, Guidance. Hermes is off-course.

927
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:58,046
CAPCOM, advise Hermes they're drifting.
Guidance, get a correction ready.

928
01:30:58,146 --> 01:31:01,145
Negative, Flight, it's not drift.
They've adjusted course.

929
01:31:01,245 --> 01:31:05,412
What the hell? Telemetry, any chance
this is instrumentation failure?

930
01:31:05,512 --> 01:31:06,440
Negative, Flight.

931
01:31:06,597 --> 01:31:10,125
Guidance, work at how long they can stay
on this course before it's irreversible.

932
01:31:10,225 --> 01:31:12,394
Working on that now, Flight.

933
01:31:12,494 --> 01:31:15,373
- Who's Rich Purnell?
- I don't know.

934
01:31:15,473 --> 01:31:17,913
Will somebody find out
who the hell Rich Purnell is?

935
01:31:18,626 --> 01:31:22,254
Annie will go before the media this morning
and inform them of NASA's decision

936
01:31:22,354 --> 01:31:25,238
to reroute the Hermes to Mars.

937
01:31:25,474 --> 01:31:28,128
Sounds like a smart move.

938
01:31:28,228 --> 01:31:30,189
Considering the circumstances.

939
01:31:30,989 --> 01:31:33,459
Whoever gave them the maneuver...

940
01:31:33,559 --> 01:31:35,719
only passed along information.

941
01:31:35,819 --> 01:31:38,221
Crew made the decision on their own.

942
01:31:39,306 --> 01:31:41,995
You may have killed them, Mitch.

943
01:31:43,368 --> 01:31:45,071
We're fighting the same war.

944
01:31:45,171 --> 01:31:48,482
Every time something goes wrong,
the world forgets why we fly.

945
01:31:48,582 --> 01:31:53,064
I'm trying to keep us airborne.
It's bigger than one person.

946
01:31:54,288 --> 01:31:56,701
No. It's not.

947
01:31:58,151 --> 01:32:01,611
When this is over,
I'll expect your resignation.

948
01:32:05,342 --> 01:32:09,726
- I understand.
- Bring our astronauts home.

949
01:32:12,299 --> 01:32:14,994
Every Ares mission requires
three years of pre-supplies.

950
01:32:15,094 --> 01:32:19,124
So NASA decided a long time ago it's a lot
easier to send some of the stuff beforehand

951
01:32:19,224 --> 01:32:22,310
rather than bring it with us.
So, as a result,

952
01:32:22,410 --> 01:32:27,515
the MAV for Ares 4 is already there
at the Schiaparelli Crater, just waiting.

953
01:32:27,615 --> 01:32:31,427
So the plan is for me
to use that to go into orbit

954
01:32:31,527 --> 01:32:34,573
just as the Hermes is passing...

955
01:32:34,673 --> 01:32:38,528
and I guess they catch me?

956
01:32:39,228 --> 01:32:41,426
In space.

957
01:32:43,091 --> 01:32:46,110
So, I've got 200 sols to figure out

958
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:49,047
how to take everything here
that's keeping me alive

959
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:52,717
the oxygenator, the water reclaimer,
the atmospheric regulator...

960
01:32:52,818 --> 01:32:54,770
bring that all with me.

961
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:58,691
And luckily, I have the greatest minds
on Planet Earth...

962
01:32:58,791 --> 01:33:01,810
really, all of the brainpower
on the entire planet

963
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:05,448
helping me with this endeavor.
And so far they've come up with,

964
01:33:05,548 --> 01:33:08,101
"Hey, why don't you drill holes
on the roof of your Rover

965
01:33:08,201 --> 01:33:11,062
"and hit it as hard as you can
with a rock?"

966
01:33:11,562 --> 01:33:13,381
We're gonna get there.

967
01:33:33,935 --> 01:33:38,650
<i>Didn't know what time it was
And the lights were low</i>

968
01:33:38,750 --> 01:33:43,490
<i>I leaned back on my radio</i>

969
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:46,925
<i>Some cat was layin' down
some rock 'n' roll</i>

970
01:33:47,025 --> 01:33:49,366
<i>Lotta soul, he said</i>

971
01:33:51,129 --> 01:33:55,391
<i>Then the loud sound did seem to fade</i>

972
01:33:55,492 --> 01:34:00,148
<i>Came back like a slow voice
on a wave of phase</i>

973
01:34:00,248 --> 01:34:05,854
<i>That weren't no DJ
That was hazy cosmic jive</i>

974
01:34:08,823 --> 01:34:12,911
<i>There's a starman waiting in the...</i>

975
01:34:13,011 --> 01:34:15,530
533 days longer?

976
01:34:15,630 --> 01:34:17,540
And you said yes to this?

977
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:20,208
He would have done the same for me.
You know that.

978
01:34:25,733 --> 01:34:29,415
Cheese. You do "cheese"? Cheese.

979
01:34:30,604 --> 01:34:33,442
- He didn't do "cheese."
- Did he do "cheese"?

980
01:34:41,032 --> 01:34:42,795
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

981
01:34:42,895 --> 01:34:45,029
I got something for you.

982
01:34:45,129 --> 01:34:49,291
Found it in the flea market.
Original pressing.

983
01:34:49,391 --> 01:34:51,668
No!

984
01:34:51,768 --> 01:34:54,221
- Not a scratch.
- I love it.

985
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:57,225
All due respect to your CNSA protocol

986
01:34:57,325 --> 01:35:01,875
but we haven't done things that way
since Apollo 9.

987
01:35:03,589 --> 01:35:05,876
Did he get that?

988
01:35:09,878 --> 01:35:14,563
<i>Look out your window,
I can see his light</i>

989
01:35:14,663 --> 01:35:18,965
<i>If we can sparkle,
he may land tonight...</i>

990
01:35:19,465 --> 01:35:21,444
Yeah?

991
01:35:24,045 --> 01:35:25,985
Mmm-hmm.

992
01:35:27,248 --> 01:35:28,099
Oh!

993
01:35:28,199 --> 01:35:32,604
<i>There's a starman waiting in the sky</i>

994
01:35:33,004 --> 01:35:35,174
<i>He'd like to come and meet us</i>

995
01:35:35,274 --> 01:35:37,476
<i>But he thinks he'd blow our minds</i>

996
01:35:37,576 --> 01:35:41,013
<i>There's a starman waiting...</i>

997
01:35:50,707 --> 01:35:52,917
<i>Let the children use it</i>

998
01:35:53,017 --> 01:35:55,262
<i>Let all the children boogie</i>

999
01:35:55,362 --> 01:35:59,423
<i>There's a starman waiting in the sky</i>

1000
01:35:59,523 --> 01:36:03,896
<i>He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds</i>

1001
01:36:03,996 --> 01:36:08,643
<i>There's a starman waiting in the sky</i>

1002
01:36:09,043 --> 01:36:13,348
<i>He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile</i>

1003
01:36:13,448 --> 01:36:17,092
<i>He told me, let the children lose it</i>

1004
01:36:17,292 --> 01:36:19,330
<i>Let the children use it</i>

1005
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:23,218
<i>Let all the children boogie...</i>

1006
01:38:14,743 --> 01:38:17,530
I've been thinking about laws on Mars.

1007
01:38:17,630 --> 01:38:20,183
There's an international treaty
saying no country can lay claim

1008
01:38:20,283 --> 01:38:21,842
to anything that's not on Earth.

1009
01:38:21,942 --> 01:38:26,930
And by another treaty, if you're not in any
country's territory maritime law applies.

1010
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:29,927
So Mars is international waters.

1011
01:38:30,827 --> 01:38:35,298
Now, NASA is an American non-military
organization. It owns the Hab.

1012
01:38:35,398 --> 01:38:38,084
But the second I walk outside,
I'm in international waters.

1013
01:38:38,184 --> 01:38:41,304
So here's the cool part, I'm about
to leave for the Schiaparelli Crater

1014
01:38:41,404 --> 01:38:43,447
where I'm gonna commandeer
the Ares 4 lander.

1015
01:38:43,547 --> 01:38:46,244
Nobody explicitly gave me permission
to do this and they can't

1016
01:38:46,344 --> 01:38:48,604
until I'm on board the Ares 4.

1017
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:52,791
So that means I'm gonna be taking
a craft over in international waters

1018
01:38:52,891 --> 01:38:58,333
without permission, which,
by definition, makes me a pirate.

1019
01:38:58,773 --> 01:39:02,456
Mark Watney, Space Pirate.

1020
01:39:31,949 --> 01:39:34,304
A Space Pirate.

1021
01:40:34,415 --> 01:40:38,143
Everywhere I go, I'm the first.

1022
01:40:39,037 --> 01:40:41,298
It's a strange feeling.

1023
01:40:41,398 --> 01:40:44,992
Step outside the Rover,
first guy to be there.

1024
01:40:45,386 --> 01:40:48,835
Climb that hill, first guy to do that.

1025
01:40:49,573 --> 01:40:53,186
Four and a half billion years...
nobody here.

1026
01:40:53,786 --> 01:40:57,284
And now, me.

1027
01:40:57,883 --> 01:41:01,786
I'm the first person to be alone
on an entire planet.

1028
01:41:16,602 --> 01:41:18,779
How's he doing?

1029
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:23,727
So far, so good.
He's sticking to schedule.

1030
01:41:23,827 --> 01:41:26,846
Drives for four hours before noon...

1031
01:41:26,946 --> 01:41:30,050
lays the solar panels,
waits 13 hours for them to recharge

1032
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:34,463
and sleeps somewhere in there
and then starts again.

1033
01:41:36,891 --> 01:41:39,926
- How's he doing?
- Uh...

1034
01:41:40,026 --> 01:41:42,725
He asked us to call him
Captain Blondebeard.

1035
01:41:44,825 --> 01:41:49,169
- Technically, Mars would be under maritime...
- Yeah, I know. He explained it to us.

1036
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:52,698
Where is he?

1037
01:41:52,798 --> 01:41:54,300
- There.
- Okay.

1038
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,566
- Here.
- Okay.

1039
01:43:41,289 --> 01:43:44,880
Okay, we're gonna start by stating for
the record that you're not gonna like this.

1040
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:47,020
Oh, yeah?

1041
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:49,673
Yeah, the problem
is the intercept velocity.

1042
01:43:49,773 --> 01:43:52,048
The Hermes, well...

1043
01:43:52,148 --> 01:43:54,496
It can't enter Mars' orbit.

1044
01:43:54,596 --> 01:43:57,874
Otherwise, they'll never have
enough fuel to make it home.

1045
01:43:57,974 --> 01:44:02,646
The MAV, that was only designed
to get to low Mars orbit.

1046
01:44:02,746 --> 01:44:05,190
So in order for Mark to escape

1047
01:44:05,290 --> 01:44:08,167
Mars' gravity entirely
and to intercept the Hermes...

1048
01:44:08,267 --> 01:44:10,120
- He has to be going fast.
- Exactly.

1049
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:12,632
Which means we need to make
the MAV lighter.

1050
01:44:12,732 --> 01:44:15,400
A lot lighter. 5,000 kilograms lighter.

1051
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:18,279
- You can do that, right?
- There's some gimmes right off the bat.

1052
01:44:18,379 --> 01:44:22,132
The design presumes 500 kilograms
of Martian soil and samples.

1053
01:44:22,232 --> 01:44:23,668
Obviously we won't do that.

1054
01:44:23,768 --> 01:44:27,506
And there's just one passenger
instead of six.

1055
01:44:27,606 --> 01:44:30,216
With suits and gear, that's another 500?

1056
01:44:30,316 --> 01:44:32,311
Ditch the life support, don't need it.

1057
01:44:32,411 --> 01:44:34,945
And we'll get Mark to wear
his EVA suit the whole trip.

1058
01:44:35,045 --> 01:44:37,590
If he's in his EVA suit,
how is he gonna operate the controls?

1059
01:44:37,690 --> 01:44:39,851
Well, he won't.

1060
01:44:39,951 --> 01:44:43,690
Martinez will pilot the MAV
remotely from the Hermes.

1061
01:44:43,790 --> 01:44:47,477
We've never had a manned ship
controlled remotely before.

1062
01:44:49,078 --> 01:44:52,290
But I am excited about
the opportunities that affords.

1063
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:55,051
If we go remote, we can lose
the control panels,

1064
01:44:55,151 --> 01:44:57,144
the secondary and tertiary comm systems.

1065
01:44:57,244 --> 01:45:01,912
Wait a second. You want a remote-controlled
ascent with no backup comms?

1066
01:45:04,169 --> 01:45:06,597
He's not even got
to the bad stuff yet, Vincent.

1067
01:45:06,697 --> 01:45:08,165
Well, let's skip to the bad stuff!

1068
01:45:08,565 --> 01:45:13,221
We need to remove the nose airlock,
the windows, and Hull Panel 19.

1069
01:45:14,631 --> 01:45:16,457
You want to take
the front of the ship off?

1070
01:45:16,557 --> 01:45:20,562
Sure. The nose airlock
alone is 400 kilograms.

1071
01:45:20,662 --> 01:45:23,097
You want to send a man into space
without the front of his ship?

1072
01:45:23,197 --> 01:45:24,999
No.

1073
01:45:25,499 --> 01:45:28,503
We're gonna have him
cover it with Hab canvas.

1074
01:45:29,603 --> 01:45:33,092
Look, the hull's mostly there
to keep the air in.

1075
01:45:33,192 --> 01:45:36,370
Mars' atmosphere is so thin,
you don't need a lot of streamlining.

1076
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:39,907
By the time the ship's going fast enough
for air resistance to matter

1077
01:45:40,007 --> 01:45:42,334
it'll be high enough
that there's practically no air.

1078
01:45:42,434 --> 01:45:45,054
You wanna send him
into space under a tarp.

1079
01:45:45,154 --> 01:45:47,006
Yes.

1080
01:45:47,406 --> 01:45:50,608
- Can I go on?
- No.

1081
01:45:56,691 --> 01:45:59,019
You think he means it like...

1082
01:45:59,319 --> 01:46:01,221
"Are you kidding me?"

1083
01:46:01,321 --> 01:46:02,638
- You know?
- Mmm-hmm.

1084
01:46:02,738 --> 01:46:05,716
Or like, "Are you kidding me?"

1085
01:46:06,643 --> 01:46:09,168
- I think it might be the second one.
- Really?

1086
01:46:09,268 --> 01:46:12,316
- Uh-huh.
- Could be the first way.

1087
01:46:12,416 --> 01:46:16,196
- "Are you kidding me?"
- Yeah, it could be the first way.

1088
01:46:40,454 --> 01:46:42,741
I know what they're doing.

1089
01:46:43,741 --> 01:46:46,452
I know exactly what they're doing.

1090
01:46:46,552 --> 01:46:51,174
They just keep repeating, "Go faster than
any man in the history of space travel."

1091
01:46:51,624 --> 01:46:56,089
Like that's a good thing. Like it'll
distract me from how insane their plan is.

1092
01:46:56,513 --> 01:47:00,250
Yeah, I get to go faster than any man
in the history of space travel...

1093
01:47:00,350 --> 01:47:03,287
because you are launching me
in a convertible.

1094
01:47:03,387 --> 01:47:06,824
Actually it's worse than that because
I won't even be able to control the thing.

1095
01:47:07,024 --> 01:47:09,820
And by the way, physicists,

1096
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:14,809
when describing things like acceleration
do not use the word "fast."

1097
01:47:14,909 --> 01:47:20,498
So... they're only doing that in the hopes
that I won't raise any objections...

1098
01:47:21,172 --> 01:47:23,049
to this lunacy.

1099
01:47:24,117 --> 01:47:28,829
Because I like the way "fastest man
in the history of space travel" sounds.

1100
01:47:30,357 --> 01:47:32,915
I do like the way it sounds.

1101
01:47:33,602 --> 01:47:36,190
I mean, I like it a lot.

1102
01:47:37,940 --> 01:47:40,370
I'm not gonna tell them that.

1103
01:47:46,016 --> 01:47:47,801
Okay.

1104
01:47:48,601 --> 01:47:50,398
Let's do this.

1105
01:47:55,993 --> 01:48:02,451
<i>My, my, at Waterloo
Napoleon did surrender</i>

1106
01:48:02,551 --> 01:48:04,219
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1107
01:48:04,319 --> 01:48:10,742
<i>And I have met my destiny
in quite a similar way</i>

1108
01:48:10,842 --> 01:48:14,071
<i>The history book on the shelf</i>

1109
01:48:14,171 --> 01:48:17,907
<i>Is always repeating itself</i>

1110
01:48:19,376 --> 01:48:24,449
<i>Waterloo, I was defeated,
you won the war</i>

1111
01:48:25,749 --> 01:48:26,926
Come on.

1112
01:48:27,426 --> 01:48:31,271
<i>...promise to love you forevermore</i>

1113
01:48:32,365 --> 01:48:37,487
<i>Waterloo, couldn't escape
if I wanted to...</i>

1114
01:50:21,631 --> 01:50:24,813
Beck, Vogel, I want you guys
in Airlock 2, with the outer door open

1115
01:50:24,913 --> 01:50:26,729
- before the MAV even launches.
- Okay.

1116
01:50:26,829 --> 01:50:30,841
Martinez flies the MAV,
Johanssen sysops the ascent.

1117
01:50:30,941 --> 01:50:34,820
Once we hit intercept,
it's Beck's job to go get Watney.

1118
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:38,023
- We're ready.
- What's the intercept plan?

1119
01:50:38,123 --> 01:50:42,645
We finished attaching the tethers into
one long line. It's 214 meters long.

1120
01:50:42,745 --> 01:50:45,390
And I'll have the MMU,
so moving around should be easy.

1121
01:50:45,490 --> 01:50:48,509
How fast a relative velocity
can you handle?

1122
01:50:48,609 --> 01:50:50,954
I can grab the MAV
at 5 meters per second.

1123
01:50:51,254 --> 01:50:55,475
10 is like jumping onto a moving train.
So any more than that and I might miss.

1124
01:50:55,575 --> 01:50:57,316
Well, we may have some leeway.

1125
01:50:59,013 --> 01:51:03,979
The launch takes 12 minutes.
And it'll be 52 minutes before intercept.

1126
01:51:04,079 --> 01:51:09,184
Once Mark's engine shuts off, we'll know
our intercept point and velocity.

1127
01:51:09,364 --> 01:51:10,800
Vogel, you're Beck's backup.

1128
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:13,770
Everything goes well, you pull them
on board with the tether.

1129
01:51:13,870 --> 01:51:16,709
If anything goes wrong,
you go out after him.

1130
01:51:16,809 --> 01:51:20,037
- Yep.
- Okay.

1131
01:51:21,352 --> 01:51:23,415
Let's go get our boy.

1132
01:52:24,962 --> 01:52:28,482
There's a mood of tension and anxiety
here, outside Johnson Space Center.

1133
01:52:28,582 --> 01:52:31,043
As you can see,
many people have gathered here

1134
01:52:31,143 --> 01:52:34,140
to see whether or not the mission
to retrieve Mark Watney

1135
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:35,957
will be a success.

1136
01:52:36,257 --> 01:52:39,649
Remember, they've had some contact
with him, but it hasn't been very much.

1137
01:52:39,749 --> 01:52:43,290
We have to remind our viewers
that we're watching this as it unfolds.

1138
01:52:43,390 --> 01:52:47,068
So we'll try and keep you up-to-date
as to what exactly is going on.

1139
01:52:47,168 --> 01:52:52,429
Let's listen in to NASA making contact
with Mark Watney. Let's listen in.

1140
01:52:59,173 --> 01:53:01,793
If something goes wrong,
what can Mission Control do?

1141
01:53:01,893 --> 01:53:03,896
Not a damn thing.

1142
01:53:04,496 --> 01:53:07,938
It's all happening 12 light-minutes away
which means it takes 24 minutes

1143
01:53:08,038 --> 01:53:11,069
for them to get the answer
to any question they ask.

1144
01:53:11,369 --> 01:53:13,857
The whole launch is 12 minutes so...

1145
01:53:15,157 --> 01:53:17,592
they're on their own.

1146
01:54:20,359 --> 01:54:23,663
...just how long Mark has been
completely alone on Mars.

1147
01:54:23,763 --> 01:54:27,119
We're talking to a psychology
expert later to discuss...

1148
01:54:49,816 --> 01:54:51,868
Fuel pressure, green.

1149
01:54:51,968 --> 01:54:54,143
Engine alignment, perfect.

1150
01:54:54,243 --> 01:54:56,955
Communications, five by five.

1151
01:54:57,056 --> 01:55:00,177
We are ready for pre-flight
checklist, Commander.

1152
01:55:00,627 --> 01:55:04,955
Mission Control, this is Hermes actual.
We will proceed on schedule.

1153
01:55:05,055 --> 01:55:08,485
We are T-minus 2 minutes, 10 seconds
to launch, by the mark.

1154
01:55:09,945 --> 01:55:12,122
About two minutes, Watney.
How you doing down there?

1155
01:55:12,222 --> 01:55:14,174
I'm good.

1156
01:55:14,274 --> 01:55:16,537
I'm anxious to get up to you.

1157
01:55:16,687 --> 01:55:19,067
- Thanks for coming back for me.
- Well, we're on it.

1158
01:55:19,167 --> 01:55:22,671
Remember, you'll be pulling some
serious G's, so it's okay to pass out.

1159
01:55:22,771 --> 01:55:27,478
- You're in Martinez's hands now.
- Well, tell that asshole no barrel rolls.

1160
01:55:28,985 --> 01:55:30,116
Copy that, MAV.

1161
01:55:30,716 --> 01:55:32,895
- CAPCOM.
- Go.

1162
01:55:32,995 --> 01:55:34,756
- Remote command.
- Go.

1163
01:55:34,856 --> 01:55:36,649
- Recovery.
- Go.

1164
01:55:37,049 --> 01:55:39,611
- Secondary recovery.
- Go.

1165
01:55:39,911 --> 01:55:41,771
Pilot.

1166
01:55:42,271 --> 01:55:43,230
Go.

1167
01:55:43,330 --> 01:55:45,858
- Pilot.
- Go.

1168
01:55:45,958 --> 01:55:48,045
Copy. We're go.

1169
01:55:48,145 --> 01:55:50,506
Mission Control, we are go for launch.

1170
01:55:51,289 --> 01:55:53,467
T-minus ten... nine...

1171
01:55:53,567 --> 01:55:56,394
- Main engine start.
- ...eight...

1172
01:55:56,494 --> 01:55:59,289
seven... Mooring clamps released.

1173
01:55:59,389 --> 01:56:02,718
- About five seconds, Watney. Hang on.
- I'll see you in a few, Commander.

1174
01:56:02,818 --> 01:56:04,396
...four...

1175
01:56:04,696 --> 01:56:06,064
three...

1176
01:56:06,414 --> 01:56:09,024
two... one.

1177
01:56:45,305 --> 01:56:49,810
Velocity, 741 meters per second.
Altitude, 1350 meters.

1178
01:56:49,910 --> 01:56:52,372
- That's too low.
- It's fighting me.

1179
01:56:56,258 --> 01:56:58,499
Watney...

1180
01:56:58,599 --> 01:57:00,861
do you read?

1181
01:57:05,576 --> 01:57:09,923
- Booster separation complete.
- Velocity, 850. Altitude, 1843.

1182
01:57:10,023 --> 01:57:12,726
- He's well below target altitude.
- How far below?

1183
01:57:13,326 --> 01:57:14,853
Checking.

1184
01:57:15,053 --> 01:57:16,972
Watney...

1185
01:57:17,072 --> 01:57:19,366
- do you read?
- He's probably passed out.

1186
01:57:19,466 --> 01:57:21,952
He pulled 12 g's on the ascent.
Give him a few minutes.

1187
01:57:22,052 --> 01:57:23,336
Copy that.

1188
01:57:25,707 --> 01:57:27,701
Main shutdown in three...

1189
01:57:27,801 --> 01:57:31,012
two, one... shutdown.

1190
01:57:32,606 --> 01:57:37,059
Back to automatic guidance.
Shutdown confirmed.

1191
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:41,353
Fuel reserves depleted.

1192
01:57:42,591 --> 01:57:45,498
Watney... do you read?

1193
01:57:46,695 --> 01:57:49,261
It seems there's some sort of problem
with the transmission.

1194
01:57:56,338 --> 01:57:58,019
I have interval pings.

1195
01:57:58,119 --> 01:58:00,085
Intercept velocity will be
11 meters per second.

1196
01:58:00,185 --> 01:58:01,967
I can make that work.

1197
01:58:02,754 --> 01:58:04,956
Distance at intercept will be...

1198
01:58:05,506 --> 01:58:07,658
we'll be 68 kilometers apart.

1199
01:58:07,758 --> 01:58:12,013
68 kilometers?
Did she just say 68 kilometers?

1200
01:58:12,839 --> 01:58:15,552
Come on, guys, keep it together.
Work the problem.

1201
01:58:15,652 --> 01:58:19,807
- Johanssen, time to intercept?
- 39 minutes, 12 seconds.

1202
01:58:20,615 --> 01:58:23,726
Martinez, what if we point our thrusters
in the same direction?

1203
01:58:23,826 --> 01:58:27,405
Well, it depends how much fuel you wanna
save for the altitude adjustments

1204
01:58:27,505 --> 01:58:29,525
- for the trip home.
- How much do you need?

1205
01:58:29,625 --> 01:58:34,472
I can get by with about 20%
of what we have left.

1206
01:58:34,572 --> 01:58:38,325
If we use 75.5% of remaining
altitude-adjust fuel,

1207
01:58:38,425 --> 01:58:40,702
that'll bring the intercept
range to zero.

1208
01:58:40,802 --> 01:58:42,404
Do it.

1209
01:58:42,504 --> 01:58:44,983
Hang on. It brings the range to zero

1210
01:58:45,083 --> 01:58:48,381
but the intercept velocity
will be 42 meters per second.

1211
01:58:48,481 --> 01:58:50,053
And that's way too fast.

1212
01:58:50,663 --> 01:58:54,055
Then we'll have 39 minutes
to figure out how to slow down.

1213
01:58:57,211 --> 01:59:00,492
- Martinez, burn the jets.
- Copy that.

1214
01:59:23,048 --> 01:59:26,101
- MAV to Hermes.
- Watney?

1215
01:59:26,201 --> 01:59:28,046
Affirmative.

1216
01:59:31,231 --> 01:59:35,044
- What's your status?
- My chest hurts.

1217
01:59:35,144 --> 01:59:38,472
I broke my ribs. How are you?

1218
01:59:38,572 --> 01:59:41,308
We're working on getting to you.
There was a complication during launch.

1219
01:59:41,408 --> 01:59:44,721
Copy that. How bad is it?

1220
01:59:44,821 --> 01:59:46,523
We've corrected the intercept range,

1221
01:59:46,623 --> 01:59:48,450
but we've got a problem
with intercept velocity.

1222
01:59:48,750 --> 01:59:51,545
- How big a problem?
- 42 meters a second.

1223
01:59:52,095 --> 01:59:53,947
Well...

1224
01:59:54,447 --> 01:59:55,709
shit.

1225
02:00:00,763 --> 02:00:04,132
- Commander, I have an idea.
- Go ahead, Mark.

1226
02:00:04,332 --> 02:00:07,446
Well, if I can find
something sharp in here

1227
02:00:07,546 --> 02:00:10,449
and poke a hole in the glove
of my EVA suit

1228
02:00:10,549 --> 02:00:14,661
I could use the escaping air as
a thruster and fly towards you.

1229
02:00:14,761 --> 02:00:17,922
It would be easy to control
because it would be on my arm.

1230
02:00:18,022 --> 02:00:20,008
I can't see you having
any control if you did that.

1231
02:00:20,108 --> 02:00:24,288
You'd be eyeballing the intercept using
a thrust vector you can barely control.

1232
02:00:24,388 --> 02:00:28,142
Yes. Yes, those are all
very good points.

1233
02:00:28,442 --> 02:00:31,861
But... consider this.

1234
02:00:33,297 --> 02:00:35,866
I'd get to fly around like Iron Man.

1235
02:00:37,434 --> 02:00:40,588
Commander... let's go Iron Man.

1236
02:00:43,684 --> 02:00:47,021
- This is unexpected LOS.
- Communication lost. Stand by.

1237
02:00:48,246 --> 02:00:50,774
Maybe it's not the worst idea.

1238
02:00:50,932 --> 02:00:52,959
No, it is the worst idea.
It's the worst idea ever.

1239
02:00:53,059 --> 02:00:57,667
Not what he said.
Using atmosphere as thrust.

1240
02:00:58,574 --> 02:01:02,509
- What happens if we blow the VAL?
- You want to open the vehicular airlock?

1241
02:01:02,609 --> 02:01:05,382
- It'll give us a good kick.
- But also blow the nose off the ship.

1242
02:01:05,482 --> 02:01:08,726
And all the air would leave
and we need air to not die.

1243
02:01:08,826 --> 02:01:11,237
We would seal the bridge
and the reactor room.

1244
02:01:11,337 --> 02:01:13,406
Everywhere else would go vacuo.

1245
02:01:13,506 --> 02:01:15,576
- Vogel?
- Go ahead, Commander.

1246
02:01:15,976 --> 02:01:18,601
I need you to come inside
and make a bomb.

1247
02:01:18,701 --> 02:01:20,247
Uh... again, Commander?

1248
02:01:20,347 --> 02:01:24,393
You're a chemist. Can you make a bomb
with what you have on board?

1249
02:01:24,943 --> 02:01:26,795
Probably.

1250
02:01:27,404 --> 02:01:30,667
But I feel obliged to mention
that setting off an explosive device

1251
02:01:30,767 --> 02:01:33,528
in a spacecraft
is a terrible, terrible idea.

1252
02:01:33,878 --> 02:01:36,665
Hang on. You guys
making a bomb without me?

1253
02:01:36,765 --> 02:01:39,777
Copy that. Can you do it?

1254
02:01:41,335 --> 02:01:42,350
Ja.

1255
02:01:44,807 --> 02:01:48,418
Houston, be advised. We're going
to deliberately breach the VAL

1256
02:01:48,518 --> 02:01:51,163
- to produce a reverse thrust.
- What?

1257
02:01:51,263 --> 02:01:53,683
Beck, leave your suit on.
Meet Johanssen in Airlock 1.

1258
02:01:53,783 --> 02:01:57,144
We'll open the outer door. I need you
to place the charge on the inner door.

1259
02:01:57,244 --> 02:02:02,201
- Climb back to Airlock 2 along the hull.
- Copy. I'm on my way.

1260
02:02:08,598 --> 02:02:11,211
- I'm in, Commander.
- Copy that.

1261
02:02:20,486 --> 02:02:23,422
- Vogel, where are you?
- I'm in the kitchen.

1262
02:02:23,522 --> 02:02:25,334
Okay.

1263
02:02:28,494 --> 02:02:31,605
Commander... I can't let you
go through with this.

1264
02:02:31,705 --> 02:02:34,444
- I am prepared to cut the suit.
- Absolutely not.

1265
02:02:34,544 --> 02:02:37,112
Well, see, the thing is, I'm selfish.

1266
02:02:37,312 --> 02:02:40,178
I want all the memorials
back home to be about me.

1267
02:02:40,278 --> 02:02:43,702
- Just me.
- I should have left this guy on Mars.

1268
02:02:43,952 --> 02:02:45,670
Hey.

1269
02:02:47,873 --> 02:02:50,344
- Sugar?
- Yeah.

1270
02:02:54,130 --> 02:02:55,974
Can you hold this?

1271
02:02:56,074 --> 02:02:57,901
Liquid oxygen...

1272
02:02:58,001 --> 02:03:02,003
and some stain remover
that contains ammonia.

1273
02:03:04,724 --> 02:03:06,725
This thing here...

1274
02:03:06,825 --> 02:03:09,980
is five times stronger
than a stick of dynamite.

1275
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:11,265
How do we activate it?

1276
02:03:11,365 --> 02:03:13,982
Can you connect this
to one of our lighting panels?

1277
02:03:17,887 --> 02:03:19,415
Careful.

1278
02:03:25,505 --> 02:03:27,852
Open Airlock 1.

1279
02:03:32,771 --> 02:03:35,224
I'm on the way to Beck.

1280
02:03:38,210 --> 02:03:41,288
- Let's just hope this is a good idea.
- It is.

1281
02:03:41,388 --> 02:03:42,489
Open A1.

1282
02:03:47,737 --> 02:03:49,481
- Hi.
- Hey.

1283
02:03:52,524 --> 02:03:55,033
- You got it?
- Mmm.

1284
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:02,828
Make sure you're not in here
when this thing goes off.

1285
02:04:04,279 --> 02:04:07,455
Hey. Be careful out there.

1286
02:04:07,555 --> 02:04:09,537
In space.

1287
02:04:12,797 --> 02:04:15,234
Don't tell anyone I did that.

1288
02:04:25,093 --> 02:04:27,381
Bomb set.

1289
02:04:34,845 --> 02:04:37,863
Leaving Airlock 1.

1290
02:04:42,069 --> 02:04:44,973
Guys, I'm running the numbers,
and even with optimal VAL blow

1291
02:04:45,073 --> 02:04:48,536
- we're gonna be off on our angle.
- What's the intercept distance?

1292
02:04:48,636 --> 02:04:51,937
- Johanssen?
- 260 meters, approximate.

1293
02:04:52,037 --> 02:04:53,259
That's too far.

1294
02:05:02,449 --> 02:05:06,197
- Commander?
- Martinez, close the door.

1295
02:05:08,706 --> 02:05:11,008
Open D3.

1296
02:05:11,108 --> 02:05:12,726
And leave it open.

1297
02:05:41,524 --> 02:05:43,633
Open B2.

1298
02:05:47,646 --> 02:05:51,268
Johanssen...
time to VAL blow after initiate?

1299
02:05:51,418 --> 02:05:54,811
- 15 seconds.
- We sure know how to cut it close.

1300
02:05:55,872 --> 02:05:59,526
- Commander?
- Distance is too far. I'm going out.

1301
02:05:59,626 --> 02:06:01,529
- I can do this.
- It's not a debate.

1302
02:06:01,629 --> 02:06:03,612
I'm not risking another crew member.

1303
02:06:03,712 --> 02:06:06,977
Beck's returned.
Johanssen, initiate the bomb.

1304
02:06:07,377 --> 02:06:09,688
- Ten seconds.
- Strap in.

1305
02:06:10,288 --> 02:06:13,533
Five, four...

1306
02:06:13,633 --> 02:06:15,927
- three, two...
- Brace for deceleration.

1307
02:06:16,827 --> 02:06:19,594
...one. Activating Panel 41.

1308
02:06:41,163 --> 02:06:43,391
- Bridge seal holding.
- What's the damage?

1309
02:06:43,491 --> 02:06:46,468
Worry about that later.
What's the relative velocity?

1310
02:06:46,568 --> 02:06:50,202
- 12 meters per second.
- Copy.

1311
02:06:52,181 --> 02:06:53,977
Hook me up.

1312
02:06:54,518 --> 02:06:55,640
Done.

1313
02:07:05,689 --> 02:07:07,260
I have visual on the MAV.

1314
02:07:08,917 --> 02:07:12,380
- What's the intercept range?
- I'm checking.

1315
02:07:12,930 --> 02:07:17,059
- 312 meters.
- Did you say 312?

1316
02:07:17,159 --> 02:07:19,495
Great. I'll wave at you guys as I go by.

1317
02:07:28,580 --> 02:07:30,741
I can't get to you, Mark.
You're too far.

1318
02:07:30,841 --> 02:07:32,868
- I'm not gonna make it.
- I know.

1319
02:07:32,968 --> 02:07:34,978
Beck, unhook me. I'm going after him.

1320
02:07:35,078 --> 02:07:37,490
Commander, I got this.

1321
02:07:51,495 --> 02:07:54,794
- Mark, report.
- On my way, Commander.

1322
02:07:55,299 --> 02:07:57,193
Damn it.

1323
02:08:06,086 --> 02:08:08,571
Johanssen, what's my relative
velocity to Mark?

1324
02:08:08,671 --> 02:08:12,203
- 5.2 meters per second.
- Copy. Adjusting course.

1325
02:08:18,141 --> 02:08:20,873
3.1 meters per second.

1326
02:08:22,461 --> 02:08:25,443
Distance to target, 24 meters.

1327
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:29,237
11 meters to target.

1328
02:08:31,246 --> 02:08:33,019
Six meters.

1329
02:08:43,416 --> 02:08:44,875
Hold on, Mark.

1330
02:09:12,814 --> 02:09:15,134
I got him.

1331
02:09:16,644 --> 02:09:19,018
I got him.

1332
02:09:19,118 --> 02:09:21,610
- I got him.
- Way to go, Iron Man.

1333
02:09:24,837 --> 02:09:27,421
Beck, pull us in.

1334
02:09:29,207 --> 02:09:30,715
It's good to see you.

1335
02:09:32,644 --> 02:09:34,517
You...

1336
02:09:35,639 --> 02:09:38,734
have terrible taste in music.

1337
02:09:48,495 --> 02:09:51,671
Houston, this is Hermes actual.
We got him.

1338
02:09:53,326 --> 02:09:55,102
Watney is secure.

1339
02:10:00,415 --> 02:10:02,677
Contact in outer space with Mark Watney.

1340
02:10:02,777 --> 02:10:06,922
After a very long time, they have done
what many people thought was impossible.

1341
02:10:07,022 --> 02:10:10,677
Mission confirmation: Mark Watney
has been successfully rescued.

1342
02:10:14,665 --> 02:10:17,145
Grab a hold of him.

1343
02:10:18,451 --> 02:10:21,865
- Hey, handsome!
- Beck, close the hatch.

1344
02:10:24,475 --> 02:10:25,759
Hey, guys!

1345
02:10:30,198 --> 02:10:34,422
Houston, six crew safely aboard.

1346
02:10:37,121 --> 02:10:39,358
This is huge moment for this nation,

1347
02:10:39,458 --> 02:10:43,397
for the world and indeed,
for international space travel.

1348
02:10:43,796 --> 02:10:46,234
I can't believe anything you do works.

1349
02:10:46,564 --> 02:10:48,424
Hey!

1350
02:10:49,860 --> 02:10:52,482
- Oh, God.
- I can't believe it.

1351
02:10:53,306 --> 02:10:55,198
There's a little smell
going on over there, bud.

1352
02:10:55,298 --> 02:10:59,095
I know. I haven't had a shower
in a year and a half.

1353
02:10:59,195 --> 02:11:02,372
Don't make me laugh, I have broken ribs.

1354
02:11:35,700 --> 02:11:37,572
Hey, there.

1355
02:11:45,344 --> 02:11:47,446
- Morning, sir.
- It's an honor, sir.

1356
02:11:47,546 --> 02:11:50,767
- Sir.
- Sir.

1357
02:11:51,217 --> 02:11:53,235
Morning, sir.

1358
02:12:14,257 --> 02:12:17,019
Welcome to the Astronaut
Candidate Program.

1359
02:12:17,119 --> 02:12:21,032
Now pay attention,
because this could save your life.

1360
02:12:21,132 --> 02:12:23,777
Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.

1361
02:12:23,877 --> 02:12:27,462
All right, let me get a few things
out of the way, right off the bat. Yes...

1362
02:12:27,565 --> 02:12:32,644
I did in fact survive on a deserted
planet by farming in my own shit.

1363
02:12:33,144 --> 02:12:37,242
Yes, it's actually worse than it sounds.
So let's not talk about that ever again.

1364
02:12:38,684 --> 02:12:41,821
The other question I get
most frequently is...

1365
02:12:41,921 --> 02:12:44,432
"When I was up there,
stranded by myself...

1366
02:12:44,532 --> 02:12:47,259
"did I think I was going to die?"

1367
02:12:47,609 --> 02:12:50,088
Yes, absolutely.

1368
02:12:50,188 --> 02:12:53,150
And that's what you need to know going in
because it's going to happen to you.

1369
02:12:53,550 --> 02:12:57,195
This is space. It does not cooperate.

1370
02:12:57,295 --> 02:13:00,065
At some point, everything
is going to go south on you.

1371
02:13:00,165 --> 02:13:03,234
Everything is going to go south
and you're going to say, "This is it.

1372
02:13:03,334 --> 02:13:05,763
"This is how I end."

1373
02:13:06,363 --> 02:13:10,533
Now, you can either accept that
or you can get to work.

1374
02:13:11,435 --> 02:13:13,190
That's all it is.

1375
02:13:13,290 --> 02:13:15,965
You just begin.

1376
02:13:16,065 --> 02:13:19,110
You do the math.
You solve one problem...

1377
02:13:19,210 --> 02:13:21,672
then you solve the next one.
And then the next.

1378
02:13:21,772 --> 02:13:24,775
And if you solve enough problems,
you get to come home.

1379
02:13:25,518 --> 02:13:28,337
All right, questions?

1380
02:13:32,700 --> 02:13:35,293
Once Mission Control completes
their pre-flight checks

1381
02:13:35,393 --> 02:13:37,471
we'll begin launch procedures.

1382
02:13:37,571 --> 02:13:40,133
The Ares 5 team will rendezvous
with the Hermes

1383
02:13:40,233 --> 02:13:43,344
approximately 48 minutes after launch.

1384
02:13:43,444 --> 02:13:47,140
From there, they will have 414 days
of space travel ahead of them.

1385
02:13:47,240 --> 02:13:51,320
Have the goals changed from the previous
mission to the Ares 5 program?

1386
02:13:51,420 --> 02:13:53,513
And what do you hope to achieve
this time around?

1387
02:13:53,613 --> 02:13:57,935
Well, no. The goals have always
been the same for the Ares program.

1388
02:13:58,035 --> 02:14:01,705
This time, of course, we hope to bring
all the astronauts back at the same time.

1389
02:14:01,889 --> 02:14:05,225
- Flight, Guidance check complete.
- Copy, Guidance.

1390
02:14:05,325 --> 02:14:09,096
This is Flight. We are go
for launch, on schedule.

1391
02:14:19,475 --> 02:14:21,993
Final aerosurface checks are complete,

1392
02:14:22,093 --> 02:14:25,681
as everything remains a go
for the launch of the Ares 5.

1393
02:14:25,781 --> 02:14:27,854
20 seconds.

1394
02:14:28,301 --> 02:14:30,244
Proceeding with the count.

1395
02:14:30,344 --> 02:14:33,990
T-minus 10, 9... Main engine start.

1396
02:14:34,090 --> 02:14:38,052
7, 6, 5, 4...

1397
02:14:38,152 --> 02:14:41,608
3, 2, 1.

1398
02:14:41,708 --> 02:14:43,010
And liftoff.

1399
02:14:43,110 --> 02:14:46,527
As the crew of the Ares 5
begin the next chapter

1400
02:14:46,627 --> 02:14:49,138
of American space exploration.

1401
02:14:49,438 --> 02:14:51,491
Pressures look good.

1402
02:15:09,302 --> 02:15:10,760
Wow. Good shot.

1403
02:15:10,860 --> 02:15:14,741
There you have it. Five years after
the rescue of astronaut Mark Watney

1404
02:15:14,841 --> 02:15:18,249
an Ares 5 is on its way to Mars.

1405
02:16:10,634 --> 02:16:14,055
<i>At first I was afraid, I was petrified</i>

1406
02:16:14,155 --> 02:16:18,168
<i>Kept thinking I could never live
without you by my side</i>

1407
02:16:18,268 --> 02:16:22,456
<i>But then I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong</i>

1408
02:16:22,556 --> 02:16:26,394
<i>And I grew strong
and I learned how to get along</i>

1409
02:16:26,494 --> 02:16:30,397
<i>And so you're back from outer space</i>

1410
02:16:30,497 --> 02:16:34,544
<i>I just walked in to find you here
with that sad look upon your face</i>

1411
02:16:34,644 --> 02:16:38,849
<i>I should've changed that stupid lock
I should've made you leave your key</i>

1412
02:16:38,949 --> 02:16:42,811
<i>If I'd have known for just one second
you'd be back to bother me</i>

1413
02:16:42,911 --> 02:16:46,915
<i>Go on, now go, walk out the door</i>

1414
02:16:47,015 --> 02:16:48,963
<i>Just turn around now</i>

1415
02:16:49,063 --> 02:16:52,079
<i>'Cause you're not welcome anymore</i>

1416
02:16:52,179 --> 02:16:55,216
<i>Weren't you the one
who tried to hurt me with goodbye?</i>

1417
02:16:55,316 --> 02:16:59,378
<i>Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?</i>

1418
02:16:59,478 --> 02:17:03,382
<i>Oh, no, not I, I will survive</i>

1419
02:17:03,482 --> 02:17:07,671
<i>Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive</i>

1420
02:17:07,771 --> 02:17:11,734
<i>I've got all my life to live
and I've got all my love to give</i>

1421
02:17:11,834 --> 02:17:15,704
<i>And I'll survive, I will survive</i>

1422
02:17:15,804 --> 02:17:18,227
<i>Hey, hey</i>

1423
02:17:32,363 --> 02:17:36,317
<i>Go on, now go, walk out the door</i>

1424
02:17:36,417 --> 02:17:38,480
<i>Just turn around now</i>

1425
02:17:38,580 --> 02:17:41,549
<i>'Cause you're not welcome anymore</i>

1426
02:17:41,649 --> 02:17:44,660
<i>Weren't you the one
who tried to break me with goodbye?</i>

1427
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:48,756
<i>Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?</i>

1428
02:17:48,856 --> 02:17:52,810
<i>Oh, no, not I, I will survive</i>

1429
02:17:52,910 --> 02:17:57,073
<i>Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive</i>

1430
02:17:57,173 --> 02:18:01,219
<i>I've got all my life to live
and I've got all my love to give</i>

1431
02:18:01,319 --> 02:18:05,552
<i>And I'll survive, I will survive</i>
