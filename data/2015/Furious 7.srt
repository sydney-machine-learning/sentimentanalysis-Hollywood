<font face="Tahoma">I tried to talk to him the other night. Do you know what he said?</font>

158
00:16:06,971 --> 00:16:09,097
<font face="Tahoma">He doesn't miss the girls. He doesn't miss the cars.</font>

159
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:10,803
<font face="Tahoma">He misses the bullets.</font>

160
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:14,895
<font face="Tahoma">Let him settle in. Give him time.</font>

161
00:16:15,646 --> 00:16:17,961
<font face="Tahoma">How does nine months sound?</font>

162
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,245
<font face="Tahoma">I'm having another baby.</font>

163
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,206
<font face="Tahoma">And you didn't tell him, did you?</font>

164
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:34,252
<font face="Tahoma">You gotta tell him.</font>

165
00:16:36,468 --> 00:16:39,185
<font face="Tahoma">I don't want him to be disappointed with this life.</font>

166
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,725
<font face="Tahoma">With me.</font>

167
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:45,791
<font face="Tahoma">He will never be disappointed with you.</font>

168
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,467
<font face="Tahoma">You're the best thing that's ever happened to him.</font>

169
00:16:51,856 --> 00:16:53,162
<font face="Tahoma">Thank you.</font>

170
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:03,812
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah?</font>

171
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:05,448
<font face="Tahoma">Dominic Toretto.</font>

172
00:17:07,337 --> 00:17:08,337
<font face="Tahoma">You don't know me.</font>

173
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,569
<font face="Tahoma">You're about to.</font>

174
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:11,179
<font face="Tahoma">Private number Tokyo, Japan</font>

175
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:14,233
<font face="Tahoma">Get down!</font>

176
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:34,594
<font face="Tahoma">Jack!</font>

177
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:40,995
<font face="Tahoma">Jack!</font>

178
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:15,943
<font face="Tahoma">Shattered his collarbone, fractured his leg in two places.</font>

179
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,328
<font face="Tahoma">He only regained consciousness this morning.</font>

180
00:18:18,438 --> 00:18:21,470
<font face="Tahoma">First thing he said was, "Get me Dom".</font>

181
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,125
<font face="Tahoma">He's in there.</font>

182
00:18:36,618 --> 00:18:37,768
<font face="Tahoma">You okay?</font>

183
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:40,861
<font face="Tahoma">I'm fine.</font>

184
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:43,665
<font face="Tahoma">He's waiting. Let's go.</font>

185
00:18:54,714 --> 00:18:55,714
<font face="Tahoma">Got something for you.</font>

186
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:00,304
<font face="Tahoma">Your files.</font>

187
00:19:00,377 --> 00:19:01,455
<font face="Tahoma">Thank you.</font>

188
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,296
<font face="Tahoma">You risk life and limb to save the free world...</font>

189
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:06,762
<font face="Tahoma">and what do they give you?</font>

190
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:09,815
<font face="Tahoma">Jell-O and a bad 70's TV show.</font>

191
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:15,255
<font face="Tahoma">Y'know, it's got its perks.</font>

192
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:16,528
<font face="Tahoma">Sponge baths ain't that bad.</font>

193
00:19:16,628 --> 00:19:17,637
<font face="Tahoma">Dad!</font>

194
00:19:17,713 --> 00:19:18,713
<font face="Tahoma">I'm sorry, baby.</font>

195
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:19,982
<font face="Tahoma">"Dad"?</font>

196
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:22,493
<font face="Tahoma">Honey, I want to introduce you to somebody.</font>

197
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:24,347
<font face="Tahoma">He's a, uhh...</font>

198
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:26,345
<font face="Tahoma">He's an old friend.</font>

199
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:27,847
<font face="Tahoma">Go on and say hello.</font>

200
00:19:27,881 --> 00:19:29,147
<font face="Tahoma">Dominic Toretto, right?</font>

201
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:32,940
<font face="Tahoma">My dad said, he kicked your ass once.</font>

202
00:19:56,474 --> 00:19:57,952
<font face="Tahoma">Who did this?</font>

203
00:19:59,738 --> 00:20:01,102
<font face="Tahoma">You remember Owen Shaw?</font>

204
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:05,239
<font face="Tahoma">The one we tore half of London down trying to get.</font>

205
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:06,335
<font face="Tahoma">Well...</font>

206
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:08,403
<font face="Tahoma">This is his big, bad brother.</font>

207
00:20:08,492 --> 00:20:09,528
<font face="Tahoma">Take a look at this.</font>

208
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,669
<font face="Tahoma">"Deckard Shaw"</font>

209
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:20,182
<font face="Tahoma">British Special Forces assassin.</font>

210
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:22,418
<font face="Tahoma">The kind of unique asset...</font>

211
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,649
<font face="Tahoma">that no government would ever admit to employing.</font>

212
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:25,912
<font face="Tahoma">Black Ops boys.</font>

213
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,749
<font face="Tahoma">Worse. They created a monster.</font>

214
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:33,048
<font face="Tahoma">They felt Shaw was a necessary evil until eventually...</font>

215
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,929
<font face="Tahoma">they decided he was unnecessary.</font>

216
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:40,727
<font face="Tahoma">The powers that be, felt that he knew just a little bit too much.</font>

217
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:42,563
<font face="Tahoma">The asset became a liability.</font>

218
00:20:42,637 --> 00:20:45,450
<font face="Tahoma">So they sent in 20 elite operatives to retire him.</font>

219
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
<font face="Tahoma">And they missed.</font>

220
00:20:47,304 --> 00:20:49,977
<font face="Tahoma">That was 6 years ago and Shaw's been a ghost ever since.</font>

221
00:20:50,172 --> 00:20:51,172
<font face="Tahoma">Until now.</font>

222
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:55,270
<font face="Tahoma">How do I find him?</font>

223
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:58,182
<font face="Tahoma">The official answer is: you don't.</font>

224
00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:02,935
<font face="Tahoma">He killed Han.</font>

225
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:04,890
<font face="Tahoma">Almost killed my family.</font>

226
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:07,018
<font face="Tahoma">He also tried to put me in a body bag, too.</font>

227
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:09,585
<font face="Tahoma">Which is why when I get out, I'm gonna put a hurt on him so bad...</font>

228
00:21:09,662 --> 00:21:12,366
<font face="Tahoma">he's gonna wish his mother had kept her legs closed.</font>

229
00:21:12,783 --> 00:21:15,382
<font face="Tahoma">But until then, my official answer to you...</font>

230
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:17,329
<font face="Tahoma">is stand down.</font>

231
00:21:17,435 --> 00:21:19,343
<font face="Tahoma">Now you know I can't do that.</font>

232
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:20,683
<font face="Tahoma">I do know you, Dom.</font>

233
00:21:20,786 --> 00:21:24,492
<font face="Tahoma">Which is why now I give you a brother to brother answer.</font>

234
00:21:24,604 --> 00:21:27,131
<font face="Tahoma">You do whatever it is you gotta do.</font>

235
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,050
<font face="Tahoma">When you find that sumbitch...</font>

236
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:31,852
<font face="Tahoma">Just do me one favor.</font>

237
00:21:31,928 --> 00:21:33,041
<font face="Tahoma">What's that?</font>

238
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:36,362
<font face="Tahoma">Don't miss.</font>

239
00:21:39,018 --> 00:21:42,654
<font face="Tahoma">MONTECRISTO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</font>

240
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:47,384
<font face="Tahoma">Thank you so much for letting us stay, Mando.</font>

241
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:48,632
<font face="Tahoma">I hope it's not a problem.</font>

242
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:51,562
<font face="Tahoma">Listen, Dom needed a safe delivered to Rio in two days.</font>

243
00:21:51,674 --> 00:21:52,808
<font face="Tahoma">That was a problem.</font>

244
00:21:53,032 --> 00:21:55,053
<font face="Tahoma">Hosting his family in the Dominican Republic,</font>

245
00:21:55,143 --> 00:21:56,361
<font face="Tahoma">that is vacation.</font>

246
00:21:56,476 --> 00:21:57,811
<font face="Tahoma">Anyone messes with you here...</font>

247
00:21:57,927 --> 00:21:59,821
<font face="Tahoma">they're messing with the entire country.</font>

248
00:21:59,895 --> 00:22:00,976
<font face="Tahoma">You'll be safe.</font>

249
00:22:05,661 --> 00:22:12,335
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah, they're here. I picked them up myself at the airport.</font>

250
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:14,514
<font face="Tahoma">Hold on. Your brother.</font>

251
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,150
<font face="Tahoma">Dom.</font>

252
00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:17,477
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah, Mia, it's me.</font>

253
00:22:17,595 --> 00:22:18,595
<font face="Tahoma">How's it going there?</font>

254
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:21,321
<font face="Tahoma">We're at Mando's. This place is like a fortress.</font>

255
00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:24,841
<font face="Tahoma">You should see Brian. He's in full FBI mode.</font>

256
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:28,124
<font face="Tahoma">He built a surveillance hub in Mando's garage and everything.</font>

257
00:22:28,237 --> 00:22:30,682
<font face="Tahoma">What about you? Did you find out who's after us?</font>

258
00:22:30,797 --> 00:22:33,667
<font face="Tahoma">Looks like the sins of London have followed us home.</font>

259
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:35,541
<font face="Tahoma">How did Buster take the news?</font>

260
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:36,652
<font face="Tahoma">I can't tell him.</font>

261
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:39,196
<font face="Tahoma">If he knew about the baby, he'd stay here with us.</font>

262
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:42,043
<font face="Tahoma">And with all that's going on, you're gonna need him by your side.</font>

263
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:45,068
<font face="Tahoma">Just watch out for him. Keep him safe.</font>

264
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:47,086
<font face="Tahoma">And come home together.</font>

265
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,823
<font face="Tahoma">Tell Brian I'll see him in LA in two days.</font>

266
00:22:50,566 --> 00:22:51,566
<font face="Tahoma">Where are you going?</font>

267
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,590
<font face="Tahoma">Tokyo.</font>

268
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:55,168
<font face="Tahoma">I'm bringing Han home.</font>

269
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:59,143
<font face="Tahoma">Authorities are still trying to determine...</font>

270
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,862
<font face="Tahoma">the motive behind this daring attack here at the office...</font>

271
00:23:01,974 --> 00:23:06,285
<font face="Tahoma">of the US Diplomatic Security Service in downtown Los 羘geles...</font>

272
00:23:06,396 --> 00:23:07,436
<font face="Tahoma">less than 36 hours ago.</font>

273
00:23:08,243 --> 00:23:09,825
<font face="Tahoma">Facts are still coming in...</font>

274
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:12,934
<font face="Tahoma">but what is known is the suspect entered the building's 4th floor...</font>

275
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,293
<font face="Tahoma">Hey.</font>

276
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,370
<font face="Tahoma">- You okay? - Yeah.</font>

277
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:21,380
<font face="Tahoma">This guy's just, relentless.</font>

278
00:23:23,283 --> 00:23:24,798
<font face="Tahoma">That's why Dom needs you.</font>

279
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:28,361
<font face="Tahoma">You two need to find this guy and you need to stop him...</font>

280
00:23:28,467 --> 00:23:30,769
<font face="Tahoma">before he does any more damage to our family.</font>

281
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:34,174
<font face="Tahoma">I just...</font>

282
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:37,923
<font face="Tahoma">I've screwed up so many things.</font>

283
00:23:38,905 --> 00:23:41,853
<font face="Tahoma">I couldn't live with myself if I screwed this up, too.</font>

284
00:23:41,968 --> 00:23:43,880
<font face="Tahoma">You won't.</font>

285
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,115
<font face="Tahoma">I believe in you.</font>

286
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:49,780
<font face="Tahoma">I believe in us. That's all that matters.</font>

287
00:23:51,474 --> 00:23:52,655
<font face="Tahoma">I love you, Brian.</font>

288
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,513
<font face="Tahoma">Love you, baby.</font>

289
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:09,304
<font face="Tahoma">Just promise me. After this, we're done.</font>

290
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,762
<font face="Tahoma">No more jobs, no more enemies.</font>

291
00:24:12,675 --> 00:24:13,897
<font face="Tahoma">Come back to us.</font>

292
00:24:14,012 --> 00:24:15,884
<font face="Tahoma">I won't let you down, Mia.</font>

293
00:24:17,752 --> 00:24:18,762
<font face="Tahoma">I know.</font>

294
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:23,773
<font face="Tahoma">TOKYO, JAPAN</font>

295
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,790
<font face="Tahoma">Hey yo, Sean!</font>

296
00:24:35,814 --> 00:24:37,469
<font face="Tahoma">Hey, check this out, man.</font>

297
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:40,026
<font face="Tahoma">This dude over here wanna race the new DK.</font>

298
00:24:40,107 --> 00:24:41,272
<font face="Tahoma">Not tonight, Twinkie.</font>

299
00:24:43,404 --> 00:24:44,803
<font face="Tahoma">He said he knew Han.</font>

300
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,245
<font face="Tahoma">Han said you was fast, but not that damn fast.</font>

301
00:24:56,155 --> 00:24:58,521
<font face="Tahoma">Who said American muscle can't drift?</font>

302
00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:02,812
<font face="Tahoma">Han mentioned he left his enemies in his rear view.</font>

303
00:25:04,331 --> 00:25:05,960
<font face="Tahoma">He never talked about it much.</font>

304
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:09,666
<font face="Tahoma">Always playing it close to the vest.</font>

305
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:17,305
<font face="Tahoma">We found a couple of things by the crash.</font>

306
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:20,299
<font face="Tahoma">Wasn't much left.</font>

307
00:25:27,487 --> 00:25:28,788
<font face="Tahoma">Gisele.</font>

308
00:25:33,061 --> 00:25:34,061
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah.</font>

309
00:25:34,885 --> 00:25:36,325
<font face="Tahoma">There's one more thing.</font>

310
00:25:39,322 --> 00:25:40,614
<font face="Tahoma">I found this.</font>

311
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,182
<font face="Tahoma">Must've meant something to him.</font>

312
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:49,211
<font face="Tahoma">When you find the guy that killed Han...</font>

313
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,065
<font face="Tahoma">What are you going to do?</font>

314
00:25:53,706 --> 00:25:56,731
<font face="Tahoma">Words ain't even been invented yet.</font>

315
00:26:18,247 --> 00:26:21,552
<font face="Tahoma">They say to live in the hearts of those we leave behind...</font>

316
00:26:21,698 --> 00:26:23,933
<font face="Tahoma">is not to die.</font>

317
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:26,790
<font face="Tahoma">But he put you in his grave.</font>

318
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:31,689
<font face="Tahoma">So now I'll do the same to him.</font>

319
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,133
<font face="Tahoma">I can't do no more funerals.</font>

320
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:40,922
<font face="Tahoma">First, Han...</font>

321
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:46,221
<font face="Tahoma">Now Hobbs is laid out, of all people.</font>

322
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,964
<font face="Tahoma">We're being hunted.</font>

323
00:26:59,627 --> 00:27:01,773
<font face="Tahoma">You know he's out there somewhere watching, right?</font>

324
00:27:03,018 --> 00:27:04,072
<font face="Tahoma">I hope so.</font>

325
00:27:04,215 --> 00:27:05,610
<font face="Tahoma">That means he's close.</font>

326
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:08,754
<font face="Tahoma">Just promise me, Brian.</font>

327
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:11,363
<font face="Tahoma">No more funerals.</font>

328
00:27:12,152 --> 00:27:13,152
<font face="Tahoma">Just one more.</font>

329
00:27:17,197 --> 00:27:18,197
<font face="Tahoma">His.</font>

330
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,797
<font face="Tahoma">You never should've messed with a man's family.</font>

331
00:29:48,909 --> 00:29:50,891
<font face="Tahoma">I told your brother the same thing.</font>

332
00:29:54,264 --> 00:29:55,858
<font face="Tahoma">Reinforced your chassis.</font>

333
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,873
<font face="Tahoma">Just like going into the ring with weighted gloves.</font>

334
00:29:58,874 --> 00:30:01,394
<font face="Tahoma">Your mistake. I'm not here to play games.</font>

335
00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:03,486
<font face="Tahoma">See, you and me...</font>

336
00:30:04,323 --> 00:30:05,912
<font face="Tahoma">We're from different worlds.</font>

337
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,919
<font face="Tahoma">Trust me, I've seen a lot meaner streets than the ones you're used to.</font>

338
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:11,493
<font face="Tahoma">Stick around.</font>

339
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,494
<font face="Tahoma">It's gonna get a lot meaner.</font>

340
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:19,363
<font face="Tahoma">You think this was gonna be a street fight?</font>

341
00:30:38,449 --> 00:30:39,783
<font face="Tahoma">On the ground!</font>

342
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:41,549
<font face="Tahoma">Now!</font>

343
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:45,608
<font face="Tahoma">Drop him or I will drop you!</font>

344
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:46,718
<font face="Tahoma">Woah, woah!</font>

345
00:30:46,973 --> 00:30:49,832
<font face="Tahoma">Easy, guys. We're on the same team here.</font>

346
00:30:50,701 --> 00:30:52,078
<font face="Tahoma">Mr. Toretto...</font>

347
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:53,728
<font face="Tahoma">I'm here on the recommendation...</font>

348
00:30:53,837 --> 00:30:55,345
<font face="Tahoma">of a, mutual friend of ours.</font>

349
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:57,176
<font face="Tahoma">- Mr. Hobbs? - Who the hell are you?</font>

350
00:30:57,251 --> 00:30:58,761
<font face="Tahoma">Me? I'm just a guy.</font>

351
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,241
<font face="Tahoma">I'm, Mr. Nobody.</font>

352
00:31:01,312 --> 00:31:03,446
<font face="Tahoma">That's a big entrance for a nobody.</font>

353
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:06,305
<font face="Tahoma">And the guy who put our mutual friend in the hospital...</font>

354
00:31:07,501 --> 00:31:08,990
<font face="Tahoma">you just let him get away.</font>

355
00:31:09,064 --> 00:31:12,448
<font face="Tahoma">I think I might've just saved your ass there, Dom.</font>

356
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:15,744
<font face="Tahoma">Listen, you think you can let go of my guy there?</font>

357
00:31:15,853 --> 00:31:17,403
<font face="Tahoma">He's beginning to turn a little blue.</font>

358
00:31:19,816 --> 00:31:20,816
<font face="Tahoma">I appreciate that.</font>

359
00:31:21,606 --> 00:31:23,043
<font face="Tahoma">Here they come.</font>

360
00:31:23,872 --> 00:31:24,872
<font face="Tahoma">Listen, Dom.</font>

361
00:31:24,962 --> 00:31:29,383
<font face="Tahoma">There's a war going on between shadows and ghosts like me.</font>

362
00:31:31,295 --> 00:31:34,353
<font face="Tahoma">You and your team unwittingly walked into the middle of it in London...</font>

363
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,586
<font face="Tahoma">and it appears it's now followed you home.</font>

364
00:31:39,084 --> 00:31:40,343
<font face="Tahoma">It's up to you.</font>

365
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,762
<font face="Tahoma">I'm gonna have a beer.</font>

366
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:44,553
<font face="Tahoma">You're welcome to join me.</font>

367
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,192
<font face="Tahoma">By the way, I can get you Deckard Shaw.</font>

368
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:57,406
<font face="Tahoma">BASE OF OPERATIONS EL SEGUNDO, CALIFORNIA</font>

369
00:32:00,372 --> 00:32:01,372
<font face="Tahoma">Belgian ale.</font>

370
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:06,651
<font face="Tahoma">Man, those monks got it right.</font>

371
00:32:06,764 --> 00:32:10,760
<font face="Tahoma">I don't know about the whole celibacy thing, but when it comes to beer...</font>

372
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,305
<font face="Tahoma">Would you like one?</font>

373
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:15,715
<font face="Tahoma">I'm more of a Corona man myself.</font>

374
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:22,452
<font face="Tahoma">Your files, not only detailed...</font>

375
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:26,510
<font face="Tahoma">It's, extremely entertaining.</font>

376
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,585
<font face="Tahoma">Look, Shaw's power is that he's a shadow.</font>

377
00:32:35,735 --> 00:32:38,397
<font face="Tahoma">He's really good at getting in and out of places...</font>

378
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:40,850
<font face="Tahoma">without being seen and leaving nothing but a body count in his wake.</font>

379
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:44,045
<font face="Tahoma">He's a legitimate English badass.</font>

380
00:32:44,324 --> 00:32:48,134
<font face="Tahoma">But to be honest with you Dom, I don't give two shits about Deckard Shaw.</font>

381
00:32:48,474 --> 00:32:49,548
<font face="Tahoma">It's you I want.</font>

382
00:32:49,655 --> 00:32:54,165
<font face="Tahoma">Because you and I can help each other get what we both need.</font>

383
00:32:55,036 --> 00:32:56,720
<font face="Tahoma">I'm listening.</font>

384
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,700
<font face="Tahoma">Just recently, a private military company...</font>

385
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:01,866
<font face="Tahoma">led by a wanted terrorist named Mose Jakande...</font>

386
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,386
<font face="Tahoma">kidnapped a hacker known only by the name "Ramsey".</font>

387
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:07,452
<font face="Tahoma">Lady Liberty's got her panties in a bunch over this but rightfully so...</font>

388
00:33:07,587 --> 00:33:10,809
<font face="Tahoma">because this Ramsey has created something interesting.</font>

389
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,140
<font face="Tahoma">- Bring it up. - Yes, sir.</font>

390
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:13,736
<font face="Tahoma">Say hello...</font>

391
00:33:14,298 --> 00:33:16,095
<font face="Tahoma">To God's Eye.</font>

392
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:18,970
<font face="Tahoma">Now this little bastard hacks into anything that's on a digital network.</font>

393
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:22,661
<font face="Tahoma">That means every cellphone, satellite, ATM machine, and computer,</font>

394
00:33:22,774 --> 00:33:23,774
<font face="Tahoma">simultaneously.</font>

395
00:33:24,014 --> 00:33:27,642
<font face="Tahoma">If it's got a microphone or a lens, God's Eye can use it to find you.</font>

396
00:33:27,747 --> 00:33:30,231
<font face="Tahoma">So you invited me here to show me a tracking device.</font>

397
00:33:30,373 --> 00:33:31,971
<font face="Tahoma">On steroids. Lots of them.</font>

398
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,559
<font face="Tahoma">Let me put it to you this way.</font>

399
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:36,621
<font face="Tahoma">It took us nearly a decade to find Osama bin Laden.</font>

400
00:33:36,735 --> 00:33:39,352
<font face="Tahoma">With this, we could locate him anywhere on the planet</font>

401
00:33:39,458 --> 00:33:40,582
<font face="Tahoma">in a couple of hours.</font>

402
00:33:40,692 --> 00:33:43,105
<font face="Tahoma">Now that's a serious piece of machinery...</font>

403
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:45,341
<font face="Tahoma">that could be catastrophic in the wrong hands.</font>

404
00:33:45,415 --> 00:33:47,608
<font face="Tahoma">But for some very nauseating, political reasons...</font>

405
00:33:47,717 --> 00:33:51,815
<font face="Tahoma">any rescue plans involving any US government forces or entity...</font>

406
00:33:51,816 --> 00:33:53,861
<font face="Tahoma">has been strictly ruled out.</font>

407
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:57,389
<font face="Tahoma">And that's why I need you.</font>

408
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:59,262
<font face="Tahoma">But why do I need you?</font>

409
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:04,112
<font face="Tahoma">I mean I could go back outside, enjoy the rest of the Coronas...</font>

410
00:34:04,783 --> 00:34:06,257
<font face="Tahoma">let Shaw come to me.</font>

411
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,206
<font face="Tahoma">You could do that. How's that working out for you so far?</font>

412
00:34:09,327 --> 00:34:11,656
<font face="Tahoma">You got one friend in the ground, another one in the hospital...</font>

413
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:14,005
<font face="Tahoma">and then of course there's that little issue of the bomb...</font>

414
00:34:14,157 --> 00:34:15,412
<font face="Tahoma">that destroyed your home.</font>

415
00:34:16,702 --> 00:34:19,613
<font face="Tahoma">Shaw lives in a world that doesn't play by your rules.</font>

416
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:22,169
<font face="Tahoma">Like it or not...</font>

417
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,985
<font face="Tahoma">you live in that world now, too.</font>

418
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:27,060
<font face="Tahoma">You wanna know how to kill a shadow?</font>

419
00:34:27,751 --> 00:34:29,143
<font face="Tahoma">You just shine a little light on it.</font>

420
00:34:29,798 --> 00:34:31,606
<font face="Tahoma">If you get the God's Eye for me...</font>

421
00:34:31,607 --> 00:34:35,267
<font face="Tahoma">I've already got authorization for you to use it until you get Shaw.</font>

422
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:37,733
<font face="Tahoma">You go from the hunted, to the hunter.</font>

423
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:40,211
<font face="Tahoma">And there's no place on Earth Shaw can hide from you.</font>

424
00:34:40,323 --> 00:34:41,493
<font face="Tahoma">More importantly,</font>

425
00:34:42,222 --> 00:34:44,721
<font face="Tahoma">you and your family...</font>

426
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,547
<font face="Tahoma">don't go to any more funerals.</font>

427
00:34:48,473 --> 00:34:51,574
<font face="Tahoma">You get Ramsey, you get the God's Eye...</font>

428
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:52,789
<font face="Tahoma">You get Shaw.</font>

429
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:56,521
<font face="Tahoma">Well that's the windup and the pitch.</font>

430
00:34:57,464 --> 00:35:02,332
<font face="Tahoma">Now that I've given you this incredibly sensitive and highly classified information...</font>

431
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,529
<font face="Tahoma">What do you think, Toretto?</font>

432
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:07,064
<font face="Tahoma">I think you already know what I'm gonna do.</font>

433
00:35:07,143 --> 00:35:08,143
<font face="Tahoma">Good.</font>

434
00:35:08,255 --> 00:35:10,744
<font face="Tahoma">But, it'll be my way.</font>

435
00:35:11,963 --> 00:35:13,059
<font face="Tahoma">And my crew.</font>

436
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,932
<font face="Tahoma">I assumed you might say that.</font>

437
00:35:15,184 --> 00:35:18,993
<font face="Tahoma">Which is why I've taken the liberty of gathering your team.</font>

438
00:35:31,398 --> 00:35:32,763
<font face="Tahoma">This is crazy.</font>

439
00:35:33,809 --> 00:35:35,612
<font face="Tahoma">What the hell is going on in here?</font>

440
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:41,654
<font face="Tahoma">Our intelligence suggests that Ramsey will be transported...</font>

441
00:35:41,727 --> 00:35:44,155
<font face="Tahoma">by an armed motorcade through the Caucasus mountain range.</font>

442
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:46,418
<font face="Tahoma">If they clear this range and reach their destination...</font>

443
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:48,236
<font face="Tahoma">Ramsey's as good as gone.</font>

444
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:49,542
<font face="Tahoma">So let me get this straight.</font>

445
00:35:49,652 --> 00:35:51,838
<font face="Tahoma">There's only one road that leads in or out...?</font>

446
00:35:51,946 --> 00:35:53,789
<font face="Tahoma">Sheer drops on every side...</font>

447
00:35:53,897 --> 00:35:57,070
<font face="Tahoma">A motorcade from hell protected by a small army...</font>

448
00:35:57,183 --> 00:35:58,879
<font face="Tahoma">from one mile on either direction?</font>

449
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:00,752
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah, that's about it.</font>

450
00:36:01,844 --> 00:36:03,284
<font face="Tahoma">- You done? - No, I'm not done.</font>

451
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:07,451
<font face="Tahoma">So you all wanted me to break into a police station, fine.</font>

452
00:36:07,574 --> 00:36:09,379
<font face="Tahoma">Then you asked me to stop a tank.</font>

453
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,363
<font face="Tahoma">I wasn't happy about it, but I did it.</font>

454
00:36:11,437 --> 00:36:13,285
<font face="Tahoma">Then you came up with this brillant idea...</font>

455
00:36:13,385 --> 00:36:16,640
<font face="Tahoma">to shoot down one of the largest airplanes, ever.</font>

456
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:18,729
<font face="Tahoma">I shot that shit outta the sky...</font>

457
00:36:20,668 --> 00:36:21,668
<font face="Tahoma">It's nothing.</font>

458
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:23,469
<font face="Tahoma">But this right here, my friend...</font>

459
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:28,013
<font face="Tahoma">happens to be the stupidest idea I've ever heard of in my life.</font>

460
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:30,734
<font face="Tahoma">I forgot that, you were the only one to bring that plane down.</font>

461
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:34,851
<font face="Tahoma">No, only thing I've ever seen him take down was "No knees" Denise.</font>

462
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:36,451
<font face="Tahoma">Remember? At prom?</font>

463
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,179
<font face="Tahoma">Really, Brian? You're gonna do that right here?</font>

464
00:36:39,286 --> 00:36:41,006
<font face="Tahoma">See, y'all try'na get me off my point.</font>

465
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:44,691
<font face="Tahoma">All I'm saying is, I'm tired of everybody around me...</font>

466
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:46,170
<font face="Tahoma">making all the decisions.</font>

467
00:36:46,968 --> 00:36:48,268
<font face="Tahoma">This time, I lead.</font>

468
00:36:48,382 --> 00:36:51,900
<font face="Tahoma">Seriously. If I don't start making decisions, I'm out.</font>

469
00:36:51,985 --> 00:36:53,036
<font face="Tahoma">All right, Roman.</font>

470
00:36:53,789 --> 00:36:55,214
<font face="Tahoma">What do you got?</font>

471
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,370
<font face="Tahoma">I mean, I wouldn't try to get into the whole leadership thing, like, now.</font>

472
00:37:01,446 --> 00:37:02,807
<font face="Tahoma">You know what I'm saying? I'm just kind of...</font>

473
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,037
<font face="Tahoma">Talking about like, at some point.</font>

474
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:05,599
<font face="Tahoma">Like, you know, when we...</font>

475
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:08,182
<font face="Tahoma">Whatever. I mean, I think...</font>

476
00:37:10,825 --> 00:37:11,825
<font face="Tahoma">Let's hit it from here.</font>

477
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:13,690
<font face="Tahoma">- I don't think that that's... - No, don't think.</font>

478
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:15,309
<font face="Tahoma">That's my job.</font>

479
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:19,529
<font face="Tahoma">Okay.</font>

480
00:37:20,694 --> 00:37:22,817
<font face="Tahoma">It is impossible to hit it there.</font>

481
00:37:23,653 --> 00:37:26,387
<font face="Tahoma">That is literally the most secure spot on the mountain.</font>

482
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:29,568
<font face="Tahoma">Why? Because you cannot physically access it.</font>

483
00:37:29,692 --> 00:37:31,557
<font face="Tahoma">Now see, that's what makes it so sweet.</font>

484
00:37:31,702 --> 00:37:34,746
<font face="Tahoma">Because it's the place that they least expect us to hit them from.</font>

485
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:37,811
<font face="Tahoma">As much as I hate to admit it, he's on to something there.</font>

486
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:38,925
<font face="Tahoma">What do you think, Dom?</font>

487
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:40,748
<font face="Tahoma">Here?</font>

488
00:37:40,772 --> 00:37:41,772
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah.</font>

489
00:37:42,854 --> 00:37:44,688
<font face="Tahoma">I think we got a plan.</font>

490
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:47,366
<font face="Tahoma">Completely wrong thinking.</font>

491
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:48,599
<font face="Tahoma">And I like it.</font>

492
00:37:49,004 --> 00:37:51,166
<font face="Tahoma">- You see? - I'm good at this.</font>

493
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,860
<font face="Tahoma">Good?</font>

494
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,129
<font face="Tahoma">Okay.</font>

495
00:37:54,276 --> 00:37:56,784
<font face="Tahoma">How are you planning on getting on that road?</font>

496
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,425
<font face="Tahoma">Well, Tej?</font>

497
00:38:01,691 --> 00:38:03,490
<font face="Tahoma">I think I may actually have a plan for that.</font>

498
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,087
<font face="Tahoma">What? I delegated.</font>

499
00:38:06,964 --> 00:38:08,436
<font face="Tahoma">That's what good leaders do.</font>

500
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,510
<font face="Tahoma">Leader!</font>

501
00:38:10,534 --> 00:38:13,070
<font face="Tahoma">You know, when I was reading your files...</font>

502
00:38:13,186 --> 00:38:15,563
<font face="Tahoma">I was impressed with what you've accomplished with your team.</font>

503
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:18,357
<font face="Tahoma">But, meeting them now I gotta say, Dom...</font>

504
00:38:19,502 --> 00:38:20,880
<font face="Tahoma">you truly have a gift.</font>

505
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:27,996
<font face="Tahoma">Consider my workshop your new playhouse.</font>

506
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,500
<font face="Tahoma">I think you'll find our cars...</font>

507
00:38:29,618 --> 00:38:31,316
<font face="Tahoma">extremely appealing.</font>

508
00:38:32,263 --> 00:38:33,454
<font face="Tahoma">And your team...</font>

509
00:38:34,507 --> 00:38:35,517
<font face="Tahoma">is now complete.</font>

510
00:38:46,553 --> 00:38:47,845
<font face="Tahoma">I went to the house.</font>

511
00:38:49,355 --> 00:38:50,849
<font face="Tahoma">I was looking for you everywhere.</font>

512
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:54,215
<font face="Tahoma">You scared the shit outta me.</font>

513
00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:00,164
<font face="Tahoma">You will never be alone...</font>

514
00:39:03,522 --> 00:39:04,644
<font face="Tahoma">Where did you find that?</font>

515
00:39:08,506 --> 00:39:09,792
<font face="Tahoma">Found it in Han's car.</font>

516
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:11,678
<font face="Tahoma">It was left as a message.</font>

517
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:13,713
<font face="Tahoma">A message I plan on returning.</font>

518
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:16,594
<font face="Tahoma">Can you ride?</font>

519
00:39:16,706 --> 00:39:18,254
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah, of course I can.</font>

520
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:20,569
<font face="Tahoma">Han was my family, too.</font>

521
00:39:25,225 --> 00:39:26,225
<font face="Tahoma">Brian!</font>

522
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,891
<font face="Tahoma">We're gonna need long travel suspension...</font>

523
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,108
<font face="Tahoma">limited slip differentials in all of them.</font>

524
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,208
<font face="Tahoma">How you doing.</font>

525
00:39:32,762 --> 00:39:33,792
<font face="Tahoma">Tej!</font>

526
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:36,887
<font face="Tahoma">I want the demon lovechild between that...</font>

527
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:39,539
<font face="Tahoma">and that.</font>

528
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:42,201
<font face="Tahoma">That's a lot of armor.</font>

529
00:39:42,314 --> 00:39:44,982
<font face="Tahoma">Just gonna add more weight, slow you down.</font>

530
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,999
<font face="Tahoma">This time it ain't just about being fast.</font>

531
00:39:56,957 --> 00:39:58,870
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah, I'm good.</font>

532
00:40:00,807 --> 00:40:02,648
<font face="Tahoma">From the streets, you know what I'm sayin'?</font>

533
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,406
<font face="Tahoma">It's nothing.</font>

534
00:40:10,656 --> 00:40:12,850
<font face="Tahoma">Hey, Roman, you're freaking out, ain't you?</font>

535
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:15,054
<font face="Tahoma">- No. - Yeah, you are.</font>

536
00:40:15,127 --> 00:40:16,127
<font face="Tahoma">I said, no.</font>

537
00:40:16,287 --> 00:40:19,587
<font face="Tahoma">Listen man, it takes a grown man to embrace his feelings.</font>

538
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,971
<font face="Tahoma">If you need to cry, just go ahead and cry.</font>

539
00:40:23,062 --> 00:40:25,963
<font face="Tahoma">As your friend, you know I'm concerned about your well-being.</font>

540
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:27,550
<font face="Tahoma">Which is why I took the precaution...</font>

541
00:40:27,624 --> 00:40:30,011
<font face="Tahoma">of putting some adult diapers in your glove compartment.</font>

542
00:40:30,082 --> 00:40:31,321
<font face="Tahoma">Can you just chill out, man?</font>

543
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:36,075
<font face="Tahoma">I have seen some crazy shit, Dom, but this really could make some waves.</font>

544
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:39,006
<font face="Tahoma">So let's just try to keep it as low key as possible, huh?</font>

545
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,628
<font face="Tahoma">Don't I always?</font>

546
00:40:40,706 --> 00:40:43,729
<font face="Tahoma">I tell you what: you knock it down a couple of notches this time...</font>

547
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:47,076
<font face="Tahoma">and I'll swap out my Belgian for a keg of Corona.</font>

548
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:49,925
<font face="Tahoma">You'd be doing yourself a favor there.</font>

549
00:40:50,903 --> 00:40:53,415
<font face="Tahoma">Can somebody just walk me through what we're supposed to be doing here?</font>

550
00:40:53,476 --> 00:40:55,319
<font face="Tahoma">Come on, Rom. This was your plan, you gotta embrace it.</font>

551
00:40:55,423 --> 00:40:56,685
<font face="Tahoma">No, this was not my plan.</font>

552
00:41:00,903 --> 00:41:02,506
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah, here we go. Gametime.</font>

553
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,571
<font face="Tahoma">Roman, you need some fresh air?</font>

554
00:41:17,598 --> 00:41:19,515
<font face="Tahoma">'Cause you about to get a whole lot of it.</font>

555
00:41:23,165 --> 00:41:24,470
<font face="Tahoma">Okay, here we go!</font>

556
00:41:42,565 --> 00:41:44,590
<font face="Tahoma">Just when you didn't think it can get any better, huh?</font>

557
00:41:51,382 --> 00:41:52,382
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, shit!</font>

558
00:42:07,407 --> 00:42:08,407
<font face="Tahoma">Now we're moving.</font>

559
00:42:15,545 --> 00:42:18,457
<font face="Tahoma">Everybody good? Everybody make it out?</font>

560
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,890
<font face="Tahoma">You should tell 'em, that this is not for you!</font>

561
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:26,965
<font face="Tahoma">This is not your mission!</font>

562
00:42:27,071 --> 00:42:29,839
<font face="Tahoma">Rom, what's up man! Talk to me, come on!</font>

563
00:42:30,206 --> 00:42:32,101
<font face="Tahoma">- I can't do it. - The hell, you can't!</font>

564
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,643
<font face="Tahoma">Come on man! You throw that thing in reverse and get your ass out here now!</font>

565
00:42:35,645 --> 00:42:38,114
<font face="Tahoma">Look I can't do it, okay? Listen to what I'm saying.</font>

566
00:42:38,115 --> 00:42:39,115
<font face="Tahoma">Now isn't the time!</font>

567
00:42:39,144 --> 00:42:40,589
<font face="Tahoma">I'mma stay up here with the pilot.</font>

568
00:42:40,704 --> 00:42:43,816
<font face="Tahoma">We're gonna circle around and make sure we're holding them down from up here!</font>

569
00:42:43,885 --> 00:42:45,221
<font face="Tahoma">We're running out of time!</font>

570
00:42:45,334 --> 00:42:47,493
<font face="Tahoma">The chute is guided by GPS!</font>

571
00:42:47,604 --> 00:42:49,405
<font face="Tahoma">You don't have to do anything!</font>

572
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,181
<font face="Tahoma">- Tej! - I'm already on it.</font>

573
00:42:51,691 --> 00:42:53,063
<font face="Tahoma">Listen, man. Listen</font>

574
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:56,522
<font face="Tahoma">I'm sorry to let y'all down, okay? I'mma go ahead and stay up here.</font>

575
00:42:56,647 --> 00:42:57,448
<font face="Tahoma">No, brother.</font>

576
00:42:57,563 --> 00:42:59,829
<font face="Tahoma">- I'm sorry to let you down. - What?</font>

577
00:43:01,488 --> 00:43:02,488
<font face="Tahoma">Is that...?</font>

578
00:43:05,439 --> 00:43:07,460
<font face="Tahoma">Tej! What are you doing?</font>

579
00:43:10,782 --> 00:43:14,647
<font face="Tahoma">No!</font>

580
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:15,920
<font face="Tahoma">Tej!</font>

581
00:43:18,446 --> 00:43:19,784
<font face="Tahoma">I hate you, Tej!</font>

582
00:43:23,137 --> 00:43:24,137
<font face="Tahoma">Get ready!</font>

583
00:43:24,147 --> 00:43:25,660
<font face="Tahoma">Ground's coming fast!</font>

584
00:43:33,514 --> 00:43:34,755
<font face="Tahoma">C'mon, baby.</font>

585
00:43:34,861 --> 00:43:36,019
<font face="Tahoma">Come on.</font>

586
00:44:23,889 --> 00:44:25,130
<font face="Tahoma">Touchdown, baby!</font>

587
00:44:29,662 --> 00:44:31,031
<font face="Tahoma">Car check. Call it in.</font>

588
00:44:31,107 --> 00:44:32,287
<font face="Tahoma">- Check. - Check.</font>

589
00:44:32,288 --> 00:44:33,347
<font face="Tahoma">I'm good, let's do this.</font>

590
00:44:36,413 --> 00:44:37,898
<font face="Tahoma">Hello? Please man!</font>

591
00:44:38,014 --> 00:44:39,736
<font face="Tahoma">Get me outta here, somebody!</font>

592
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:41,098
<font face="Tahoma">No! The trees!</font>

593
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:42,805
<font face="Tahoma">Shit.</font>

594
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:44,689
<font face="Tahoma">Sit tight, Roman. We'll come back for you.</font>

595
00:44:44,771 --> 00:44:46,048
<font face="Tahoma">This is not the plan!</font>

596
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:54,861
<font face="Tahoma">CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS, AZERBAIJAN</font>

597
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,450
<font face="Tahoma">All right.</font>

598
00:45:07,451 --> 00:45:08,903
<font face="Tahoma">You got one chance to hit them here, Dom.</font>

599
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:10,564
<font face="Tahoma">You miss, they'll make it to their black site...</font>

600
00:45:10,715 --> 00:45:13,177
<font face="Tahoma">they'll squeeze whatever information they need out of Ramsey.</font>

601
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:16,080
<font face="Tahoma">The device and your chance of ever getting Shaw will be gone for good.</font>

602
00:45:16,189 --> 00:45:17,211
<font face="Tahoma">That ain't gonna happen.</font>

603
00:45:17,905 --> 00:45:18,905
<font face="Tahoma">I'll see you at the pickup.</font>

604
00:45:24,295 --> 00:45:25,575
<font face="Tahoma">Ramsey, will be in the bus.</font>

605
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:26,623
<font face="Tahoma">Then let's do this.</font>

606
00:45:36,265 --> 00:45:38,198
<font face="Tahoma">Captain we have company. Four cars inbound.</font>

607

608
00:46:05,643 --> 00:46:07,018
<font face="Tahoma">- Tej, shoot it! - I'm on the way!</font>

<font face="Tahoma">Bulletproof, baby.</font>

611
00:46:27,064 --> 00:46:28,064
<font face="Tahoma">Punch it!</font>

612
00:46:52,807 --> 00:46:53,807

00:47:06,168 --> 00:47:07,168
<font face="Tahoma">Yes, sir.</font>

615
00:47:10,936 --> 00:47:11,936
<font face="Tahoma">No!</font>

616
00:47:15,138 --> 00:47:16,138
<font face="Tahoma">Shit!</font>

617
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:17,418
<font face="Tahoma">Get out of the way!</font>

618
00:47:30,618 --> 00:47:32,534
<font face="Tahoma">Those aren't guns, those are goddamn cannons!</font>

619
00:47:32,645 --> 00:47:33,835
<font face="Tahoma">Armor piercing rounds!</font>

620
00:47:58,023 --> 00:47:59,023
<font face="Tahoma">Hook 'em up.</font>

621
00:48:05,942 --> 00:48:07,446
<font face="Tahoma">Brian, Tej, blow it!</font>

622
00:48:16,425 --> 00:48:17,425
<font face="Tahoma">Lock it up.</font>

623
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:29,939
<font face="Tahoma">Brian, you're up!</font>

624
00:48:48,437 --> 00:48:49,945
<font face="Tahoma">Little closer, Tej!</font>

625
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:26,279
<font face="Tahoma">Ramsey?</font>

626
00:49:26,386 --> 00:49:27,752
<font face="Tahoma">Stay away from me! Stay back!</font>

627
00:49:27,866 --> 00:49:29,090
<font face="Tahoma">Don't you touch me!</font>

628
00:49:29,198 --> 00:49:30,942
<font face="Tahoma">My name's Brian, and I'm gonna get you out of here...</font>

629
00:49:30,943 --> 00:49:32,198
<font face="Tahoma">but I'm gonna need you to settle down, all right?</font>

630
00:49:32,273 --> 00:49:33,570
<font face="Tahoma">I'm gonna cut those things off of you.</font>

631
00:49:49,276 --> 00:49:50,276
<font face="Tahoma">Sir?</font>

632
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,304
<font face="Tahoma">Sir, we have an unidentified vehicle approaching.</font>

633
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:56,870
<font face="Tahoma">Come on! Closer!</font>

634
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,303
<font face="Tahoma">You have to jump!</font>

635
00:49:58,375 --> 00:49:59,594
<font face="Tahoma">We're out of time. Come on.</font>

636
00:49:59,672 --> 00:50:00,952
<font face="Tahoma">We gotta get out of here!</font>

637
00:50:01,608 --> 00:50:02,608
<font face="Tahoma">Come on!</font>

638
00:50:03,002 --> 00:50:04,002
<font face="Tahoma">Look at me!</font>

639
00:50:04,026 --> 00:50:06,247
<font face="Tahoma">If you don't jump, we're gonna die! Okay?</font>

640
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:08,361

641
00:50:08,475 --> 00:50:09,475

642
00:50:09,862 --> 00:50:10,862
<font face="Tahoma">Two!</font>

643
00:50:19,532 --> 00:50:21,150
<font face="Tahoma">Well, well, well.</font>

644
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:28,740
<font face="Tahoma">Take my hand!</font>

645
00:50:44,196 --> 00:50:46,597
<font face="Tahoma">Welcome to the party, Mr. Shaw.</font>

646
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:37,592
<font face="Tahoma">Letty, stay with Brian.</font>

647
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,300
<font face="Tahoma">Oh shit!</font>

648
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,365
<font face="Tahoma">What are you doing? This is crazy!</font>

649
00:52:09,481 --> 00:52:10,741
<font face="Tahoma">Keeping you alive!</font>

650
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:57,069
<font face="Tahoma">There's a cliff.</font>

651
00:52:57,429 --> 00:52:59,120
<font face="Tahoma">Cliff! cliff!</font>

652
00:53:40,494 --> 00:53:41,494
<font face="Tahoma">No!</font>

653
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,476
<font face="Tahoma">Too slow!</font>

654
00:55:15,286 --> 00:55:16,808
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah!</font>

655
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:20,690
<font face="Tahoma">I'm back, bitches!</font>

656
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:53,930
<font face="Tahoma">You good?</font>

657
00:56:53,976 --> 00:56:55,181
<font face="Tahoma">Thank you.</font>

658
00:57:12,452 --> 00:57:13,822
<font face="Tahoma">Roman! Get back to the others.</font>

659
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:14,448
<font face="Tahoma">What about you?</font>

660
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:15,915
<font face="Tahoma">Don't worry about me.</font>

661
00:58:13,893 --> 00:58:16,520
<font face="Tahoma">I have to say, I am impressed.</font>

662
00:58:17,048 --> 00:58:19,906
<font face="Tahoma">I would very much like to know the name...</font>

663
00:58:20,018 --> 00:58:23,478
<font face="Tahoma">of the man who is causing me so much trouble.</font>

664
00:58:24,519 --> 00:58:25,975
<font face="Tahoma">There is no way out of there.</font>

665
00:58:26,809 --> 00:58:27,964
<font face="Tahoma">What is he doing?</font>

666
00:58:28,042 --> 00:58:29,939
<font face="Tahoma">He's frozen like a damn deer on headlights.</font>

667
00:58:30,105 --> 00:58:31,742
<font face="Tahoma">Toretto ain't no deer.</font>

668
00:58:31,894 --> 00:58:33,013
<font face="Tahoma">Come on, Dominic.</font>

669
00:58:33,672 --> 00:58:36,943
<font face="Tahoma">Give us the girl, and I'll let you live.</font>

670
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,600
<font face="Tahoma">What are you going to do?</font>

671
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:43,347
<font face="Tahoma">You might wanna put on your helmet for this one.</font>

672
00:58:52,582 --> 00:58:54,053
<font face="Tahoma">Target the driver!</font>

673
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,962
<font face="Tahoma">Dammit! What is he thinking?</font>

674
00:59:04,418 --> 00:59:05,818
<font face="Tahoma">You're insane!</font>

675
00:59:14,001 --> 00:59:15,517
<font face="Tahoma">You're pointing the wrong way!</font>

676
00:59:16,133 --> 00:59:17,166
<font face="Tahoma">Am I now?</font>

677
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:25,741
<font face="Tahoma">Fire on my mark.</font>

678
00:59:26,859 --> 00:59:27,859
<font face="Tahoma">Interesting.</font>

679
00:59:28,091 --> 00:59:29,091
<font face="Tahoma">Three!</font>

680
00:59:29,752 --> 00:59:30,752
<font face="Tahoma">Two!</font>

681
00:59:31,247 --> 00:59:32,247
<font face="Tahoma">Hold on.</font>

682
00:59:32,249 --> 00:59:33,249
<font face="Tahoma">One!</font>

683
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:35,290
<font face="Tahoma">Fire!</font>

684
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:32,138
<font face="Tahoma">Looks like our demon lovechild worked.</font>

685
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:33,833
<font face="Tahoma">That's one way down a mountain.</font>

686
01:00:35,126 --> 01:00:36,126
<font face="Tahoma">Where's Ramsey?</font>

687
01:00:50,245 --> 01:00:52,008
<font face="Tahoma">Hello Kitty's awake.</font>

688
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,409
<font face="Tahoma">She don't look like a hacker to me.</font>

689
01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:00,259
<font face="Tahoma">Oh yeah? And what do hackers look like?</font>

690
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,459
<font face="Tahoma">They don't suppose to look...</font>

691
01:01:01,571 --> 01:01:02,571
<font face="Tahoma">like that.</font>

692
01:01:03,175 --> 01:01:07,095
<font face="Tahoma">I'm just saying, like, how they normally wear them li'l weird glasses...</font>

693
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:11,056
<font face="Tahoma">that's all crooked, with pimples all over they face from drinking soda.</font>

694
01:01:11,603 --> 01:01:14,498
<font face="Tahoma">I mean trust me, with a body like that...</font>

695
01:01:14,609 --> 01:01:16,415
<font face="Tahoma">I ain't gonna park it behind a computer.</font>

696
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,140
<font face="Tahoma">How you feeling?</font>

697
01:01:19,518 --> 01:01:20,574
<font face="Tahoma">Did you hit your head?</font>

698
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,265
<font face="Tahoma">Feeling nauseous? Ears ringing?</font>

699
01:01:24,758 --> 01:01:25,758
<font face="Tahoma">No?</font>

700
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:27,152
<font face="Tahoma">Where's my shoe?</font>

701
01:01:27,263 --> 01:01:29,390
<font face="Tahoma">It flew off when you crashed.</font>

702
01:01:29,502 --> 01:01:32,196
<font face="Tahoma">When you start experiencing any of those things, let me know. Okay?</font>

703
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:35,117
<font face="Tahoma">I don't know whether to thank you for rescuing me...</font>

704
01:01:35,118 --> 01:01:37,746
<font face="Tahoma">or to kick your ass for throwing me off a cliff.</font>

705
01:01:38,542 --> 01:01:40,664
<font face="Tahoma">Thank us or kick our ass, huh?</font>

706
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,016
<font face="Tahoma">How about you tell us where that device is?</font>

707
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:48,360
<font face="Tahoma">I mailed it to a friend.</font>

708
01:01:48,812 --> 01:01:50,058
<font face="Tahoma">In Abu Dhabi.</font>

709
01:01:50,417 --> 01:01:51,976
<font face="Tahoma">That was pretty easy.</font>

710
01:01:52,678 --> 01:01:55,112
<font face="Tahoma">That other team would've tortured you for that information.</font>

711
01:01:55,113 --> 01:01:56,419
<font face="Tahoma">I didn't trust them.</font>

712
01:01:57,407 --> 01:01:58,598
<font face="Tahoma">I trust you.</font>

713
01:01:59,539 --> 01:02:03,029
<font face="Tahoma">Now why would you trust us? You barely know us.</font>

714
01:02:03,173 --> 01:02:04,477
<font face="Tahoma">I know enough.</font>

715
01:02:06,252 --> 01:02:09,598
<font face="Tahoma">Ex-cop. Military, something like that.</font>

716
01:02:10,401 --> 01:02:12,408
<font face="Tahoma">The way you took out those guys, serious training.</font>

717
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:16,670
<font face="Tahoma">Tech guy. Offended by the hacker remark, naturally.</font>

718
01:02:17,718 --> 01:02:18,718
<font face="Tahoma">Alpha.</font>

719
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
<font face="Tahoma">Mrs. Alpha.</font>

720
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:24,157
<font face="Tahoma">Joker.</font>

721
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:25,903
<font face="Tahoma">Wrong.</font>

722
01:02:27,466 --> 01:02:28,647
<font face="Tahoma">Double Alpha.</font>

723
01:02:29,205 --> 01:02:31,439
<font face="Tahoma">Man-candy. Y'know what I'm saying?</font>

724
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,031
<font face="Tahoma">Man, sit your candy-ass down.</font>

725
01:02:35,479 --> 01:02:37,407
<font face="Tahoma">The disrespect is real around here.</font>

726
01:02:37,518 --> 01:02:40,311
<font face="Tahoma">Life is binary. Zeroes and ones.</font>

727
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:42,470
<font face="Tahoma">Only two things keep a group like this together.</font>

728
01:02:42,506 --> 01:02:43,989
<font face="Tahoma">Fear or loyalty.</font>

729
01:02:44,105 --> 01:02:46,616
<font face="Tahoma">And I don't see a drop of fear among you guys.</font>

730
01:02:46,724 --> 01:02:49,169
<font face="Tahoma">Very impressive. Just one thing.</font>

731
01:02:49,749 --> 01:02:51,071
<font face="Tahoma">They're not married.</font>

732
01:02:51,145 --> 01:02:53,521
<font face="Tahoma">She's so off as crack, you're just gonna roll with it?</font>

733
01:02:53,637 --> 01:02:56,199
<font face="Tahoma">You're telling me there can't be a double alpha in one group?</font>

734
01:02:56,274 --> 01:02:57,499
<font face="Tahoma">You work for the US government?</font>

735
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:01,172
<font face="Tahoma">We got similar interests.</font>

736
01:03:04,894 --> 01:03:06,763
<font face="Tahoma">Tej, call it in.</font>

737
01:03:07,596 --> 01:03:08,708
<font face="Tahoma">We're going to the Middle East!</font>

738
01:03:30,162 --> 01:03:32,395
<font face="Tahoma">Hey, Dom, it was pretty wild in that mountain, huh?</font>

739
01:03:32,943 --> 01:03:34,427
<font face="Tahoma">That was too close.</font>

740
01:03:35,195 --> 01:03:36,861
<font face="Tahoma">But we got the job done.</font>

741
01:03:38,698 --> 01:03:40,818
<font face="Tahoma">Know what the crazy thing is? It's...</font>

742
01:03:41,978 --> 01:03:43,452
<font face="Tahoma">You missed the bullets.</font>

743
01:03:45,012 --> 01:03:46,651
<font face="Tahoma">That's messed up, huh?</font>

744
01:03:46,761 --> 01:03:50,789
<font face="Tahoma">Brian, I've seen you jump from trains, dive from planes.</font>

745
01:03:51,439 --> 01:03:53,895
<font face="Tahoma">Hell, I saw your courage the day I met you.</font>

746
01:03:54,014 --> 01:03:55,014
<font face="Tahoma">Right.</font>

747
01:03:55,569 --> 01:03:57,929
<font face="Tahoma">You wanna know the bravest thing I've ever saw you do?</font>

748
01:04:00,341 --> 01:04:01,710
<font face="Tahoma">Be a good man to M韆.</font>

749
01:04:02,616 --> 01:04:05,563
<font face="Tahoma">Being a great father to my nephew, Jack.</font>

750
01:04:07,304 --> 01:04:08,865
<font face="Tahoma">Everyone's looking for their thrill...</font>

751
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:10,198
<font face="Tahoma">but what's real,</font>

752
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,836
<font face="Tahoma">is family.</font>

753
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:14,751
<font face="Tahoma">Your family.</font>

754
01:04:15,547 --> 01:04:17,275
<font face="Tahoma">Hold on to that, Brian.</font>

755
01:04:25,398 --> 01:04:28,297
<font face="Tahoma">UNITED ARAB EMIRATES</font>

756
01:05:22,787 --> 01:05:25,193
<font face="Tahoma">This was hotter than I thought it would be.</font>

757
01:05:25,303 --> 01:05:27,804
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah, well, we are in the desert so, it would be hot.</font>

758
01:05:27,955 --> 01:05:29,686
<font face="Tahoma">No, I ain't talking about the weather.</font>

759
01:05:35,521 --> 01:05:36,627
<font face="Tahoma">My, my, my.</font>

760
01:05:45,019 --> 01:05:48,079
<font face="Tahoma">Now that, is a woman that's worth falling out a plane for.</font>

761
01:05:48,912 --> 01:05:52,156
<font face="Tahoma">Get outta there, man. I got dibs on that. You see me looking at that.</font>

762
01:05:52,264 --> 01:05:53,341
<font face="Tahoma">Did you just say "dibs"?</font>

763
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:54,771
<font face="Tahoma">What are you, in the fourth grade?</font>

764
01:05:54,846 --> 01:05:56,320
<font face="Tahoma">Man, can you just get outta there?</font>

765
01:05:56,403 --> 01:05:57,557
<font face="Tahoma">It's a free market.</font>

766
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:58,885
<font face="Tahoma">What are you talking about?</font>

767
01:05:59,001 --> 01:06:00,147
<font face="Tahoma">- Get outta that. - Free.</font>

768
01:06:00,182 --> 01:06:01,462
<font face="Tahoma">Rock, paper, scissors for it.</font>

769
01:06:02,438 --> 01:06:04,227
<font face="Tahoma">Are you guys for real right now?</font>

770
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:05,623
<font face="Tahoma">Look at you.</font>

771
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:09,382
<font face="Tahoma">You both look whooped already. You got stalker eyes.</font>

772
01:06:09,457 --> 01:06:12,762
<font face="Tahoma">I tried to call dibs on Ramsey. Two years ago.</font>

773
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,535
<font face="Tahoma">Her knee, my balls.</font>

774
01:06:14,646 --> 01:06:16,776
<font face="Tahoma">Trust me, you don't wanna do that.</font>

775
01:06:17,503 --> 01:06:19,654
<font face="Tahoma">Hey! Ramsey!</font>

776
01:06:20,256 --> 01:06:21,670
<font face="Tahoma">Hello, Zafar.</font>

777
01:06:25,332 --> 01:06:26,266
<font face="Tahoma">So you made some new friends.</font>

778
01:06:26,413 --> 01:06:28,576
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah, some short- tempered new friends.</font>

779
01:06:28,646 --> 01:06:30,597
<font face="Tahoma">I need the speed drive I sent you. Where is it?</font>

780
01:06:30,709 --> 01:06:33,077
<font face="Tahoma">Oh good, you will be pleased to know. I sold it.</font>

781
01:06:34,952 --> 01:06:36,032
<font face="Tahoma">You sold it?</font>

782
01:06:36,488 --> 01:06:37,488
<font face="Tahoma">You hear that?</font>

783
01:06:37,512 --> 01:06:39,808
<font face="Tahoma">I asked you to take care of it.</font>

784
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:40,714
<font face="Tahoma">Why on Earth would you sell it?</font>

785
01:06:40,821 --> 01:06:42,307
<font face="Tahoma">We're gonna need it back.</font>

786
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:44,257
<font face="Tahoma">Impossible.</font>

787
01:06:44,368 --> 01:06:47,688
<font face="Tahoma">Zafar, I stashed something inside it. It's important.</font>

788
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:48,812
<font face="Tahoma">Okay.</font>

789
01:06:48,925 --> 01:06:51,596
<font face="Tahoma">Good news: It is safe.</font>

790
01:06:52,281 --> 01:06:53,648
<font face="Tahoma">And the bad news?</font>

791
01:06:54,369 --> 01:06:55,591
<font face="Tahoma">It is very safe.</font>

792
01:06:56,755 --> 01:06:59,369
<font face="Tahoma">Sold it to a Jordanian prince living up there.</font>

793
01:06:59,479 --> 01:07:00,932
<font face="Tahoma">Trust fund billionaire.</font>

794
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,771
<font face="Tahoma">Said he wanted it in his supercar.</font>

795
01:07:02,919 --> 01:07:04,687
<font face="Tahoma">Now see, this...</font>

796
01:07:04,794 --> 01:07:07,750
<font face="Tahoma">This I like. Billionaire, supercar.</font>

797
01:07:07,863 --> 01:07:09,322
<font face="Tahoma">What makes it so, "s鷓er"?</font>

798
01:07:09,433 --> 01:07:12,139
<font face="Tahoma">242 mile per hour, top speed.</font>

799
01:07:12,253 --> 01:07:14,490
<font face="Tahoma">And, it's bulletproof.</font>

800
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:19,641
<font face="Tahoma">Am I the only one around right now?</font>

801
01:07:19,749 --> 01:07:21,523
<font face="Tahoma">It's like, y'know what I'm sayin?</font>

802
01:07:21,633 --> 01:07:22,633
<font face="Tahoma">.....</font>

803
01:07:23,141 --> 01:07:24,141
<font face="Tahoma">Whatever.</font>

804
01:07:24,171 --> 01:07:25,172
<font face="Tahoma">Where does he keep it?</font>

805
01:07:26,962 --> 01:07:27,962
<font face="Tahoma">In his penthouse.</font>

806
01:07:27,986 --> 01:07:29,107
<font face="Tahoma">Tower number one.</font>

807
01:07:30,347 --> 01:07:32,778
<font face="Tahoma">Now why in the hell would he keep his car in his penthouse?</font>

808
01:07:32,885 --> 01:07:34,178
<font face="Tahoma">He's a billionaire, my friend.</font>

809
01:07:34,262 --> 01:07:35,940
<font face="Tahoma">He can do whatever he wants.</font>

810
01:07:36,665 --> 01:07:38,936
<font face="Tahoma">Now, tomorrow happens to be the longest day of the year.</font>

811
01:07:39,008 --> 01:07:42,416
<font face="Tahoma">Prince wants to celebrate it, host a party, tomorrow afternoon.</font>

812
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:44,002
<font face="Tahoma">So you can get us up there, right?</font>

813
01:07:44,148 --> 01:07:44,823
<font face="Tahoma">Sure.</font>

814
01:07:44,973 --> 01:07:48,155
<font face="Tahoma">But not dressed like that.</font>

815
01:08:17,868 --> 01:08:18,868
<font face="Tahoma">What?</font>

816
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:20,208
<font face="Tahoma">Something wrong?</font>

817
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:22,346
<font face="Tahoma">There's a billion things wrong.</font>

818
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,385
<font face="Tahoma">But not in this moment.</font>

819
01:08:26,325 --> 01:08:27,325
<font face="Tahoma">You look handsome.</font>

820
01:08:28,055 --> 01:08:29,460
<font face="Tahoma">I feel awkward.</font>

821
01:08:31,055 --> 01:08:32,352
<font face="Tahoma">You and me both.</font>

822
01:08:33,357 --> 01:08:34,597
<font face="Tahoma">Seeing you dressed like this...</font>

823
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,655
<font face="Tahoma">Just reminds me of something.</font>

824
01:08:38,332 --> 01:08:39,332
<font face="Tahoma">Of what?</font>

825
01:08:42,045 --> 01:08:43,382
<font face="Tahoma">Old times.</font>

826
01:08:56,323 --> 01:08:57,323
<font face="Tahoma">You okay?</font>

827
01:08:57,908 --> 01:08:59,353
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah, I'm fine .</font>

828
01:09:00,989 --> 01:09:02,319
<font face="Tahoma">Showtime.</font>

829
01:09:37,538 --> 01:09:38,670
<font face="Tahoma">No, listen, man.</font>

830
01:09:38,785 --> 01:09:40,937
<font face="Tahoma">They're telling me they party like this everyday,</font>

831
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:42,652
<font face="Tahoma">on this level, they party everyday.</font>

832
01:09:42,735 --> 01:09:44,336
<font face="Tahoma">This is crazy. I might have to move out here.</font>

833
01:09:45,044 --> 01:09:48,037
<font face="Tahoma">I think I'mma start a new culture. It's called "Blarab".</font>

834
01:09:48,148 --> 01:09:49,551
<font face="Tahoma">You know, like Black Arab?</font>

835
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:50,886
<font face="Tahoma">How are we looking, Tej?</font>

836
01:09:50,997 --> 01:09:52,257
<font face="Tahoma">We're almost in position.</font>

837
01:09:52,368 --> 01:09:53,625
<font face="Tahoma">Okay, so this is how we work this.</font>

838
01:09:54,113 --> 01:09:56,299
<font face="Tahoma">We gotta move in sync if we're gonna pull this off so let's...</font>

839
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:59,654
<font face="Tahoma">go over it to make sure everyone clearly understands their role.</font>

840
01:09:59,766 --> 01:10:01,209
<font face="Tahoma">Roman, that means you.</font>

841
01:10:01,323 --> 01:10:03,714
<font face="Tahoma">You know what? You're being real unprofessional right now, Tej.</font>

842
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:07,202
<font face="Tahoma">The God's Eye chip is hidden in a speed drive installed in the prince's car...</font>

843
01:10:07,272 --> 01:10:08,950
<font face="Tahoma">which he keeps in a safe room vault.</font>

844
01:10:09,058 --> 01:10:11,503
<font face="Tahoma">Now I make 8 to 10 playing closed security.</font>

845
01:10:11,615 --> 01:10:12,841
<font face="Tahoma">Not to mention the prince...</font>

846
01:10:13,563 --> 01:10:16,042
<font face="Tahoma">and his personal bodyguards.</font>

847
01:10:16,152 --> 01:10:17,778
<font face="Tahoma">Security cameras are clustered by the north wall</font>

848
01:10:17,877 --> 01:10:18,577
<font face="Tahoma">that's where the vault is.</font>

849
01:10:18,687 --> 01:10:21,878
<font face="Tahoma">Now to get in that vault, we gotta tap into the security system...</font>

850
01:10:21,993 --> 01:10:23,454
<font face="Tahoma">which can be accessed in the prince's bedroom.</font>

851
01:10:23,534 --> 01:10:25,208
<font face="Tahoma">Alright, guys. I'm going in.</font>

852
01:10:27,867 --> 01:10:28,867
<font face="Tahoma">Excuse me.</font>

853
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,535
<font face="Tahoma">I was just looking for...</font>

854
01:10:31,797 --> 01:10:33,595
<font face="Tahoma">- The party is that way. - What?</font>

855
01:10:33,705 --> 01:10:34,705
<font face="Tahoma">This room is off...</font>

856
01:10:41,054 --> 01:10:42,054
<font face="Tahoma">Now once we're tapped in</font>

857
01:10:42,143 --> 01:10:44,428
<font face="Tahoma">Ramsey and I can hack into the network and pop the door</font>

858
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,122
<font face="Tahoma">so you can get in and get that chip.</font>

859
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:48,258
<font face="Tahoma">Wait, wait. You missed a step.</font>

860
01:10:48,334 --> 01:10:50,381
<font face="Tahoma">What about my steps? What am I supposed to be doing?</font>

861
01:10:50,498 --> 01:10:51,757
<font face="Tahoma">No, we didn't miss anything.</font>

862
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:54,097
<font face="Tahoma">You're special team, so when we need you...</font>

863
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:55,496
<font face="Tahoma">do what you do best.</font>

864
01:10:55,615 --> 01:10:56,792
<font face="Tahoma">And that is?</font>

865
01:10:57,778 --> 01:11:01,616
<font face="Tahoma">Shine brightly, like only Roman Pearce can do.</font>

866
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,596
<font face="Tahoma">Now we're talking.</font>

867
01:11:04,711 --> 01:11:06,363
<font face="Tahoma">Alright, Tej. I'm in.</font>

868
01:11:06,438 --> 01:11:08,605
<font face="Tahoma">Find a phone jack. The tap always runs behind that.</font>

869
01:11:08,718 --> 01:11:12,291
<font face="Tahoma">It's gonna be a 350 mega Hertz CAT5 D cable.</font>

870
01:11:12,402 --> 01:11:13,943
<font face="Tahoma">They probably got a couple dozen back there.</font>

871
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:16,213
<font face="Tahoma">But this'll be the bonded pair with a plenum coat.</font>

872
01:11:16,285 --> 01:11:17,730
<font face="Tahoma">English, Tej.</font>

873
01:11:17,843 --> 01:11:19,076
<font face="Tahoma">It'll be the orange wire.</font>

874
01:11:21,741 --> 01:11:24,034
<font face="Tahoma">Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the pilot's seat.</font>

875
01:11:28,405 --> 01:11:29,405
<font face="Tahoma">Alright, Roman.</font>

876
01:11:30,205 --> 01:11:32,244
<font face="Tahoma">Do whatever it is you do.</font>

877
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:34,160
<font face="Tahoma">It's your birthday, right?</font>

878
01:11:34,877 --> 01:11:35,995
<font face="Tahoma">Are you Jasmine?</font>

879
01:11:36,113 --> 01:11:38,416
<font face="Tahoma">God, no. Not the birthday routine.</font>

880
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:40,107
<font face="Tahoma">Happy birthday to you. This way.</font>

881
01:11:40,183 --> 01:11:43,352
<font face="Tahoma">Excuse me, so sorry. I'm coming through, sorry.</font>

882
01:11:43,496 --> 01:11:44,496
<font face="Tahoma">Right this way.</font>

883
01:11:44,558 --> 01:11:46,212
<font face="Tahoma">Listen, excuse me one second.</font>

884
01:11:46,638 --> 01:11:48,431
<font face="Tahoma">Man, you ain't...</font>

885
01:11:48,547 --> 01:11:50,493
<font face="Tahoma">Sir, thank you so much.</font>

886
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:53,087
<font face="Tahoma">Listen, people. Please everybody, gather around.</font>

887
01:11:53,205 --> 01:11:55,436
<font face="Tahoma">Understand something right now.</font>

888
01:11:55,543 --> 01:11:57,350
<font face="Tahoma">Listen to what I'm telling y'all.</font>

889
01:11:57,458 --> 01:12:02,134
<font face="Tahoma">We are here to celebrate Jasmine's 18th birthday.</font>

890
01:12:02,246 --> 01:12:03,480
<font face="Tahoma">Happy birthday, my dear.</font>

891
01:12:03,587 --> 01:12:08,232
<font face="Tahoma">Happy birthday to you.</font>

892
01:12:09,608 --> 01:12:11,065
<font face="Tahoma">To you.</font>

893
01:12:11,929 --> 01:12:13,490
<font face="Tahoma">To you.</font>

894
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:16,359
<font face="Tahoma">I wish I didn't see that.</font>

895
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:22,134
<font face="Tahoma">Ramsey, open it up for us.</font>

896
01:12:22,246 --> 01:12:23,247
<font face="Tahoma">Copy that.</font>

897
01:12:23,357 --> 01:12:24,535
<font face="Tahoma">You're in.</font>

898
01:12:39,047 --> 01:12:40,047
<font face="Tahoma">You realize what this is?</font>

899
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:42,163
<font face="Tahoma">Lykan HyperSport.</font>

900
01:12:42,283 --> 01:12:46,030
<font face="Tahoma">$3.4 million. 0 to 60 in less than 30 seconds.</font>

901
01:12:46,132 --> 01:12:49,075
<font face="Tahoma">There's 7 of these things in the world and this guy keeps it locked up in a vault.</font>

902
01:12:49,183 --> 01:12:52,676
<font face="Tahoma">Nothing's sadder than locking a beast in a cage.</font>

903
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,953
<font face="Tahoma">Right now I really wanna punch him in the face.</font>

904
01:12:56,068 --> 01:12:57,147
<font face="Tahoma">Okay.</font>

905
01:12:58,624 --> 01:12:59,738
<font face="Tahoma">Let's get to work.</font>

906
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:08,717
<font face="Tahoma">You got this, right?</font>

907
01:13:08,741 --> 01:13:09,741
<font face="Tahoma">Go.</font>

908
01:13:10,604 --> 01:13:11,604
<font face="Tahoma">All right.</font>

909
01:13:28,653 --> 01:13:31,158
<font face="Tahoma">Would you believe I knocked him out with my charm?</font>

910
01:13:31,785 --> 01:13:33,946
<font face="Tahoma">You ain't that charming, bitch.</font>

911
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:41,519
<font face="Tahoma">Intruders.</font>

912
01:13:41,635 --> 01:13:42,635
<font face="Tahoma">Lock it down.</font>

913
01:13:44,365 --> 01:13:46,307
<font face="Tahoma">No!</font>

914
01:13:46,502 --> 01:13:49,819
<font face="Tahoma">Tej, our magic trick is failing. We're losing systems.</font>

915
01:13:49,927 --> 01:13:50,927
<font face="Tahoma">I know.</font>

916
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:52,810
<font face="Tahoma">I see it.</font>

917
01:13:52,857 --> 01:13:54,589
<font face="Tahoma">Tej, talk to me.</font>

918
01:13:54,665 --> 01:13:56,859
<font face="Tahoma">I'm trying but their security system is locking us out.</font>

919
01:13:56,983 --> 01:13:58,840
<font face="Tahoma">Listen, ladies and gentlemen...</font>

920
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:00,450
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, there he is. These your dancers?</font>

921
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,560

923
01:14:08,063 --> 01:14:10,477
<font face="Tahoma">and noticed that all the hairspray was missing.</font>

924
01:14:10,594 --> 01:14:12,653
<font face="Tahoma">Yep. She did it.</font>

925
01:14:12,766 --> 01:14:14,306
<font face="Tahoma">Thank you.</font>

926
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:22,543
<font face="Tahoma">And we're so happy for you to be here.</font>

927
01:14:22,657 --> 01:14:24,310
<font face="Tahoma">You look like you got some missiles underneath that dress.</font>

928
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:25,793
<font face="Tahoma">He did not just...</font>

929
01:14:25,867 --> 01:14:27,107
<font face="Tahoma">Did you just say that?</font>

930
01:14:38,951 --> 01:14:40,824
<font face="Tahoma">Shit! Not the gate!</font>

931
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:44,575
<font face="Tahoma">Brian, faster!</font>

932
01:14:45,246 --> 01:14:46,567
<font face="Tahoma">We're playing all the defense we can up here.</font>

933
01:14:46,638 --> 01:14:48,358
<font face="Tahoma">But we're gonna lose, you gotta hurry up.</font>

934
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:52,889
<font face="Tahoma">Thank god, you showed up.</font>

935
01:14:55,643 --> 01:14:57,374
<font face="Tahoma">These parties bore me to death.</font>

936
01:15:49,963 --> 01:15:51,885
<font face="Tahoma">Guys get out of there right now.</font>

937
01:15:51,992 --> 01:15:53,543
<font face="Tahoma">You've got an army headed your way.</font>

938
01:15:53,618 --> 01:15:54,923
<font face="Tahoma">Brian, get up! Forget it!</font>

939
01:15:57,523 --> 01:15:58,686
<font face="Tahoma">Tej, we're taking the car.</font>

940
01:16:01,637 --> 01:16:04,593
<font face="Tahoma">This is what I do. Y'know what I'm sayin'?</font>

941
01:16:12,243 --> 01:16:14,413
<font face="Tahoma">Letty, Letty, talk to me.</font>

942
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:15,487
<font face="Tahoma">Are you okay?</font>

943
01:16:16,453 --> 01:16:18,342
<font face="Tahoma">Guys I can't hold it. I'm losing the final gate.</font>

944
01:16:18,422 --> 01:16:19,422
<font face="Tahoma">You gotta get out of there.</font>

945
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:21,375
<font face="Tahoma">Tear off the dash!</font>

946
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:22,677
<font face="Tahoma">Go through it.</font>

947
01:16:27,797 --> 01:16:30,350
<font face="Tahoma">Wait, just hold on man.</font>

948
01:16:42,422 --> 01:16:44,176
<font face="Tahoma">Time to unleash the beast.</font>

949
01:17:05,863 --> 01:17:06,863
<font face="Tahoma">Go!</font>

950
01:17:10,176 --> 01:17:11,456
<font face="Tahoma">Stay with me, I got you.</font>

951
01:17:12,856 --> 01:17:13,856
<font face="Tahoma">Let's get the hell outta here.</font>

952
01:17:55,075 --> 01:17:56,866
<font face="Tahoma">Dom. Cars don't fly!</font>

953
01:17:58,382 --> 01:17:59,382
<font face="Tahoma">Cars don't fly!</font>

954
01:18:00,665 --> 01:18:01,665
<font face="Tahoma">Shit!</font>

955
01:18:30,616 --> 01:18:31,616
<font face="Tahoma">No brakes!</font>

956
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,640
<font face="Tahoma">What?</font>

957
01:18:33,046 --> 01:18:35,967
<font face="Tahoma">- No brakes! - Shit!</font>

958
01:18:50,638 --> 01:18:51,638
<font face="Tahoma">No!</font>

959
01:19:31,257 --> 01:19:32,257
<font face="Tahoma">- Got it! - Get out!</font>

960
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:58,544

961
01:20:12,604 --> 01:20:14,167

962
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,982
<font face="Tahoma">There they are, disaster.</font>

963
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:56,634
<font face="Tahoma">I'm sorry.</font>

964
01:20:56,772 --> 01:21:00,526
<font face="Tahoma">I get you an invite to the most exclusive party in Abu Dhabi.</font>

965
01:21:00,838 --> 01:21:01,501
<font face="Tahoma">Zafar.</font>

966
01:21:01,611 --> 01:21:03,579
<font face="Tahoma">No, no, you steal the host's car.</font>

967
01:21:04,356 --> 01:21:06,154
<font face="Tahoma">And you jump it between two buildings.</font>

968
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:07,791
<font face="Tahoma">Actually, it was three buildings.</font>

969
01:21:07,844 --> 01:21:11,585
<font face="Tahoma">Oh! Two, insult. Three, honor. My bad</font>

970
01:21:11,737 --> 01:21:12,737
<font face="Tahoma">Wow, wow, wow.</font>

971
01:21:12,761 --> 01:21:14,249
<font face="Tahoma">I have to say...</font>

972
01:21:14,572 --> 01:21:19,650
<font face="Tahoma">You've got an interesting interpretation there of low key, Mr. Toretto.</font>

973
01:21:20,413 --> 01:21:23,403
<font face="Tahoma">I thought we had an understanding.</font>

974
01:21:24,331 --> 01:21:26,177
<font face="Tahoma">Sometimes you have to play the hand you're dealt.</font>

975
01:21:26,292 --> 01:21:28,829
<font face="Tahoma">That's why I prefer to be the dealer.</font>

976
01:21:30,328 --> 01:21:31,328
<font face="Tahoma">Good night.</font>

977
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:38,919
<font face="Tahoma">Kicked out of my own garage.</font>

978
01:21:38,987 --> 01:21:39,987
<font face="Tahoma">This is great.</font>

979
01:21:41,627 --> 01:21:42,993
<font face="Tahoma">May I?</font>

980
01:21:44,276 --> 01:21:46,015
<font face="Tahoma">Brian.</font>

981
01:21:46,992 --> 01:21:48,111
<font face="Tahoma">Give it to him.</font>

982
01:22:05,384 --> 01:22:08,258
<font face="Tahoma">All that trouble for this little.... thing.</font>

983
01:22:09,569 --> 01:22:11,306
<font face="Tahoma">With all due respect, Dom...</font>

984
01:22:11,569 --> 01:22:14,416
<font face="Tahoma">You really did great work back there. All of you.</font>

985
01:22:15,003 --> 01:22:17,466
<font face="Tahoma">All of my men are now standing by...</font>

986
01:22:17,467 --> 01:22:20,018
<font face="Tahoma">and are fully at your disposal.</font>

987
01:22:25,077 --> 01:22:26,077
<font face="Tahoma">Your call.</font>

988
01:22:28,273 --> 01:22:29,273
<font face="Tahoma">Ramsey.</font>

989
01:22:32,743 --> 01:22:35,911
<font face="Tahoma">Fire it up, and find me Shaw.</font>

990
01:22:41,239 --> 01:22:42,904
<font face="Tahoma">Damn, this is crazy.</font>

991
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:44,711
<font face="Tahoma">Thank you.</font>

992
01:22:46,065 --> 01:22:47,562
<font face="Tahoma">Give me a second.</font>

993
01:22:51,856 --> 01:22:52,856
<font face="Tahoma">What is it doing now?</font>

994
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,058
<font face="Tahoma">It's hunting.</font>

995
01:22:54,926 --> 01:22:57,535
<font face="Tahoma">Hacking into the security cameras at Ethihad Towers.</font>

996
01:22:57,621 --> 01:22:59,736
<font face="Tahoma">That's the last place we saw Shaw so that's where we start.</font>

997
01:23:01,909 --> 01:23:02,909
<font face="Tahoma">That's him, right there.</font>

998
01:23:04,138 --> 01:23:06,335
<font face="Tahoma">Wait. What are these numbers out here for?</font>

999
01:23:06,402 --> 01:23:08,391
<font face="Tahoma">It's biomapping Shaw's face.</font>

1000
01:23:12,214 --> 01:23:13,939
<font face="Tahoma">It will run that against every camera...</font>

1001
01:23:16,028 --> 01:23:17,708
<font face="Tahoma">Every audio device in this hemisphere.</font>

1002
01:23:30,394 --> 01:23:32,482
<font face="Tahoma">Bingo. Looks like he's holed up here.</font>

1003
01:23:33,319 --> 01:23:34,319
<font face="Tahoma">That's perfect.</font>

1004
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,813
<font face="Tahoma">Automated factory, no people. Lots of places to hide.</font>

1005
01:23:36,921 --> 01:23:39,667
<font face="Tahoma">You just changed the face of manhunts forever.</font>

1006
01:23:41,221 --> 01:23:42,221
<font face="Tahoma">Congratulations.</font>

1007
01:23:43,034 --> 01:23:45,728
<font face="Tahoma">Can I check my e-mail real quick?</font>

1008
01:23:47,037 --> 01:23:48,537
<font face="Tahoma">Dawn's up in two hours.</font>

1009
01:23:51,474 --> 01:23:53,138
<font face="Tahoma">We're gonna go take down Shaw then.</font>

1010
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:55,202
<font face="Tahoma">Go get changed.</font>

1011
01:24:00,006 --> 01:24:01,395
<font face="Tahoma">We should go now.</font>

1012
01:24:02,545 --> 01:24:04,670
<font face="Tahoma">Just you, your team and me.</font>

1013
01:24:05,361 --> 01:24:07,087
<font face="Tahoma">I thought you said at dawn?</font>

1014
01:24:07,205 --> 01:24:08,205
<font face="Tahoma">My guys are racers.</font>

1015
01:24:08,296 --> 01:24:09,742
<font face="Tahoma">Best drivers in the world.</font>

1016
01:24:10,019 --> 01:24:11,597
<font face="Tahoma">But they ain't killers.</font>

1017
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:12,733
<font face="Tahoma">Told you he'd say that.</font>

1018
01:24:12,835 --> 01:24:15,389
<font face="Tahoma">I know you too well, Dom, and I'm going with you.</font>

1019
01:24:16,182 --> 01:24:18,770
<font face="Tahoma">Looks like we got a nice little hunting party.</font>

1020
01:24:19,118 --> 01:24:20,808
<font face="Tahoma">Let's go bag a shadow.</font>

1021
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:31,222
<font face="Tahoma">Ten clicks out, boys. Get ready to rock and roll.</font>

1022
01:24:37,382 --> 01:24:38,899
<font face="Tahoma">Here we go. Weapons hot.</font>

1023
01:25:01,142 --> 01:25:02,153
<font face="Tahoma">You ready for this?</font>

1024
01:25:02,226 --> 01:25:03,226
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah.</font>

1025
01:25:33,067 --> 01:25:35,015
<font face="Tahoma">I hope you're enjoying your last meal.</font>

1026
01:25:42,301 --> 01:25:43,455
<font face="Tahoma">This is it?</font>

1027
01:25:44,175 --> 01:25:45,217
<font face="Tahoma">This is all you want?</font>

1028
01:25:46,047 --> 01:25:47,592
<font face="Tahoma">A dozen men?</font>

1029
01:25:48,324 --> 01:25:50,372
<font face="Tahoma">I think you'll find it's more than enough.</font>

1030
01:26:04,601 --> 01:26:06,290
<font face="Tahoma">I'm ready to meet my maker.</font>

1031
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:08,095
<font face="Tahoma">Are you?</font>

1032
01:26:08,364 --> 01:26:10,957
<font face="Tahoma">What were you expecting, Toretto? Catch me off guard?</font>

1033
01:26:12,219 --> 01:26:14,530
<font face="Tahoma">Me standing here, waving a white flag?</font>

1034
01:26:15,053 --> 01:26:16,421
<font face="Tahoma">Have you ever heard the saying:</font>

1035
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:18,021
<font face="Tahoma">"The enemy of my enemy...</font>

1036
01:26:18,135 --> 01:26:19,720
<font face="Tahoma">is my friend"?</font>

1037
01:26:20,881 --> 01:26:22,176
<font face="Tahoma">I don't have friends.</font>

1038
01:26:22,973 --> 01:26:24,197
<font face="Tahoma">I got family.</font>

1039
01:26:24,958 --> 01:26:28,054
<font face="Tahoma">Well, I got a lot of friends.</font>

1040
01:26:42,013 --> 01:26:44,205
<font face="Tahoma">Keep your formation! Sheppard, clear one!</font>

1041
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:45,434
<font face="Tahoma">Brian, leave it!</font>

1042
01:27:59,968 --> 01:28:00,968
<font face="Tahoma">Get down!</font>

1043
01:28:12,805 --> 01:28:13,805
<font face="Tahoma">I got you.</font>

1044
01:28:37,156 --> 01:28:38,345
<font face="Tahoma">The God's Eye.</font>

1045
01:28:58,087 --> 01:29:01,003
<font face="Tahoma">You didn't really think I was gonna walk in there naked, did you?</font>

1046
01:29:03,242 --> 01:29:04,470
<font face="Tahoma">You got hit bad.</font>

1047
01:29:05,156 --> 01:29:06,528
<font face="Tahoma">Look. Toretto.</font>

1048
01:29:07,646 --> 01:29:09,373
<font face="Tahoma">I know you won't listen to me.</font>

1049
01:29:10,062 --> 01:29:12,361
<font face="Tahoma">You're not gonna wanna hear what I have to say.</font>

1050
01:29:13,124 --> 01:29:14,526
<font face="Tahoma">But the truth is...</font>

1051
01:29:15,215 --> 01:29:16,658
<font face="Tahoma">you really ought to...</font>

1052
01:29:18,042 --> 01:29:19,660
<font face="Tahoma">try that Belgian ale, man.</font>

1053
01:29:20,737 --> 01:29:21,930
<font face="Tahoma">It's something special.</font>

1054
01:29:22,758 --> 01:29:23,878
<font face="Tahoma">Belgian ale, huh?</font>

1055
01:29:27,512 --> 01:29:28,890
<font face="Tahoma">We gotta get you to a hospital.</font>

1056
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:29,970
<font face="Tahoma">No, you're not.</font>

1057
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:31,889
<font face="Tahoma">I carry my own health insurance.</font>

1058
01:29:32,001 --> 01:29:37,590
<font face="Tahoma">SOCOM Medics on standby. They're already inbound.</font>

1059
01:29:39,214 --> 01:29:40,289
<font face="Tahoma">Pull over, kid.</font>

1060
01:29:55,012 --> 01:29:57,149
<font face="Tahoma">Dom, you got to protect Ramsey.</font>

1061
01:29:57,298 --> 01:29:58,847
<font face="Tahoma">As long as she's alive,</font>

1062
01:30:00,408 --> 01:30:02,501
<font face="Tahoma">she can lock them out of God's Eye and they know that.</font>

1063
01:30:02,574 --> 01:30:05,389
<font face="Tahoma">That means, they're not gonna stop coming until they've got her.</font>

1064
01:30:06,229 --> 01:30:07,678
<font face="Tahoma">And this time when they come...</font>

1065
01:30:07,790 --> 01:30:09,842
<font face="Tahoma">They're gonna come with everything they've got.</font>

1066
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:11,750
<font face="Tahoma">I'm not leaving you.</font>

1067
01:30:11,862 --> 01:30:12,918
<font face="Tahoma">You're not.</font>

1068
01:30:13,646 --> 01:30:14,867
<font face="Tahoma">I'm leaving you.</font>

1069
01:30:18,048 --> 01:30:19,293
<font face="Tahoma">Go now, Dom.</font>

1070
01:30:33,674 --> 01:30:36,388
<font face="Tahoma">A war is coming to us whether we like it or not.</font>

1071
01:30:37,509 --> 01:30:38,794
<font face="Tahoma">But if a war's coming...</font>

1072
01:30:41,562 --> 01:30:43,726
<font face="Tahoma">We're gonna face them on the streets we know best.</font>

1073
01:30:49,585 --> 01:30:52,169
<font face="Tahoma">I'm all for winging it, but this is crazy, man.</font>

1074
01:30:52,687 --> 01:30:55,224
<font face="Tahoma">We got mercenaries with some real heat on us.</font>

1075
01:30:56,592 --> 01:30:58,046
<font face="Tahoma">I mean I ain't scared of nothing but...</font>

1076
01:30:58,148 --> 01:30:59,642
<font face="Tahoma">..I don't even have a gun.</font>

1077
01:31:00,967 --> 01:31:01,967
<font face="Tahoma">Gun?</font>

1078
01:31:04,181 --> 01:31:05,697
<font face="Tahoma">We got a whole city.</font>

1079
01:31:05,809 --> 01:31:07,260
<font face="Tahoma">And we may have more than that.</font>

1080
01:31:07,367 --> 01:31:08,556
<font face="Tahoma">If they use God's Eye...</font>

1081
01:31:08,665 --> 01:31:10,866
<font face="Tahoma">it will tap the cameras around to find our location.</font>

1082
01:31:10,934 --> 01:31:12,809
<font face="Tahoma">Which means we could plant a virus.</font>

1083
01:31:13,459 --> 01:31:15,116
<font face="Tahoma">And then break in when they access it.</font>

1084
01:31:15,813 --> 01:31:18,255
<font face="Tahoma">So you're talking about hacking my hacking device.</font>

1085
01:31:18,370 --> 01:31:19,455
<font face="Tahoma">That's brilliant.</font>

1086
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:21,729
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah, but there's one problem.</font>

1087
01:31:21,838 --> 01:31:22,851
<font face="Tahoma">The signal strength.</font>

1088
01:31:22,962 --> 01:31:26,319
<font face="Tahoma">We can't start a hack on them until they're within a two mile range.</font>

1089
01:31:26,431 --> 01:31:28,122
<font face="Tahoma">- That's really close. - Close?</font>

1090
01:31:28,265 --> 01:31:29,464
<font face="Tahoma">These guys are military.</font>

1091
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:32,270
<font face="Tahoma">If they're within two miles of us, we already dead.</font>

1092
01:31:32,379 --> 01:31:36,633
<font face="Tahoma">I don't know about y'all, but I didn't really plan on dying today.</font>

1093
01:31:36,745 --> 01:31:38,647
<font face="Tahoma">Only one way to stay alive.</font>

1094
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:41,325
<font face="Tahoma">We play keepaway with Ramsey.</font>

1095
01:31:41,434 --> 01:31:42,154
<font face="Tahoma">What?</font>

1096
01:31:42,268 --> 01:31:43,915
<font face="Tahoma">They can't hit us if we keep moving.</font>

1097
01:31:43,992 --> 01:31:45,224
<font face="Tahoma">And I'll take Shaw.</font>

1098
01:31:45,755 --> 01:31:48,953
<font face="Tahoma">So basically we're just gearing up for a big game of hot potato, huh?</font>

1099
01:31:51,299 --> 01:31:53,651
<font face="Tahoma">Why does it feel like I'm not gonna see you again?</font>

1100
01:32:07,203 --> 01:32:08,640
<font face="Tahoma">I'll come back for that.</font>

1101
01:32:10,398 --> 01:32:11,398
<font face="Tahoma">Promise?</font>

1102
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:15,238
<font face="Tahoma">Promise.</font>

1103
01:32:35,249 --> 01:32:36,314
<font face="Tahoma">Brian, are you okay?</font>

1104
01:32:36,436 --> 01:32:37,599
<font face="Tahoma">M韆, listen to me.</font>

1105
01:32:38,184 --> 01:32:39,803
<font face="Tahoma">Something's about to go down.</font>

1106
01:32:40,418 --> 01:32:42,539
<font face="Tahoma">If you don't hear from me in 24 hours...</font>

1107
01:32:45,141 --> 01:32:46,868
<font face="Tahoma">I need you to take Jack and move on.</font>

1108
01:32:50,147 --> 01:32:51,147
<font face="Tahoma">You understand?</font>

1109
01:32:53,046 --> 01:32:54,053
<font face="Tahoma">You understand what I'm saying?</font>

1110
01:32:55,161 --> 01:32:56,894
<font face="Tahoma">No I can't do that, Brian.</font>

1111
01:32:57,619 --> 01:32:58,619
<font face="Tahoma">No, I can't.</font>

1112
01:33:00,438 --> 01:33:01,733
<font face="Tahoma">We're gonna have another baby.</font>

1113
01:33:03,067 --> 01:33:04,181
<font face="Tahoma">It's a little girl.</font>

1114
01:33:07,229 --> 01:33:08,871
<font face="Tahoma">And she's going to need her father.</font>

1115
01:33:08,973 --> 01:33:11,044
<font face="Tahoma">So you have to finish what you're doing...</font>

1116
01:33:11,161 --> 01:33:12,522
<font face="Tahoma">and you have to come home to her.</font>

1117
01:33:14,031 --> 01:33:15,491
<font face="Tahoma">You have to come home to us.</font>

1118
01:33:17,209 --> 01:33:19,340
<font face="Tahoma">I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.</font>

1119
01:33:19,859 --> 01:33:23,143
<font face="Tahoma">I was scared you'd be disappointed with domestic life.</font>

1120
01:33:25,583 --> 01:33:28,786
<font face="Tahoma">You know the best decision I ever made was stepping into that store...</font>

1121
01:33:30,355 --> 01:33:31,705
<font face="Tahoma">buying that first sandwich.</font>

1122
01:33:34,233 --> 01:33:36,406
<font face="Tahoma">It was such a bad s醤dwich.</font>

1123
01:33:37,177 --> 01:33:38,547
<font face="Tahoma">I know.</font>

1124
01:33:38,695 --> 01:33:39,771
<font face="Tahoma">But I ate a lot of 'em.</font>

1125
01:33:49,492 --> 01:33:50,492
<font face="Tahoma">I love you, M韆.</font>

1126
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:54,930
<font face="Tahoma">Don't do that.</font>

1127
01:33:54,954 --> 01:33:55,954
<font face="Tahoma">What?</font>

1128
01:33:56,568 --> 01:33:57,573
<font face="Tahoma">The way you said it. It's like goodbye.</font>

1129
01:33:57,695 --> 01:33:58,975
<font face="Tahoma">Say something else.</font>

1130
01:34:00,912 --> 01:34:02,738
<font face="Tahoma">Okay. Kiss Jack for me.</font>

1131
01:34:05,513 --> 01:34:06,513
<font face="Tahoma">I will.</font>

1132
01:34:13,251 --> 01:34:14,434
<font face="Tahoma">I love you, Brian.</font>

1133
01:34:18,118 --> 01:34:19,453
<font face="Tahoma">I love you, M韆.</font>

1134
01:34:51,106 --> 01:34:53,054
<font face="Tahoma">One last ride.</font>

1135
01:36:00,802 --> 01:36:03,319
<font face="Tahoma">Boot up God's Eye, and find them.</font>

1136
01:36:17,626 --> 01:36:18,626
<font face="Tahoma">I'm getting something.</font>

1137
01:36:21,982 --> 01:36:23,997
<font face="Tahoma">I got a positive ID. It's Toretto.</font>

1138
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,189
<font face="Tahoma">God's Eye is placing him at Hill and Seventh.</font>

1139
01:36:31,845 --> 01:36:33,000
<font face="Tahoma">Should we follow him?</font>

1140
01:36:33,184 --> 01:36:35,448
<font face="Tahoma">No. Let Shaw take care of him.</font>

1141
01:36:35,558 --> 01:36:36,296
<font face="Tahoma">Find Ramsey.</font>

1142
01:36:36,405 --> 01:36:37,470
<font face="Tahoma">Yes, sir.</font>

1143
01:36:44,235 --> 01:36:46,257
<font face="Tahoma">I don't know why we gotta keep driving around like this.</font>

1144
01:36:46,410 --> 01:36:47,927
<font face="Tahoma">Why can't we just pull over somewhere...</font>

1145
01:36:48,037 --> 01:36:50,881
<font face="Tahoma">park, gather our thoughts in like a bunker somewhere?</font>

1146
01:36:50,994 --> 01:36:52,797
<font face="Tahoma">Because it does not work like that.</font>

1147
01:36:52,947 --> 01:36:55,067
<font face="Tahoma">We gotta stick close enough to the bad guys...</font>

1148
01:36:55,179 --> 01:36:57,156
<font face="Tahoma">in order to get in range for Ramsey to hack 'em...</font>

1149
01:36:57,268 --> 01:37:00,152
<font face="Tahoma">but we gotta be mobile enough not to get shot like fish in a barrel.</font>

1150
01:37:00,232 --> 01:37:02,712
<font face="Tahoma">So do me a favor, focus on the mission, keep us from getting killed.</font>

1151
01:37:04,918 --> 01:37:06,393
<font face="Tahoma">Got them. Target acquired.</font>

1152
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:08,593
<font face="Tahoma">She's riding shotgun in a blue GT-R.</font>

1153
01:37:16,955 --> 01:37:18,041
<font face="Tahoma">Guys, they're here.</font>

1154
01:37:18,157 --> 01:37:19,413
<font face="Tahoma">How many cars?</font>

1155
01:37:19,531 --> 01:37:20,254
<font face="Tahoma">None.</font>

1156
01:37:20,367 --> 01:37:21,910
<font face="Tahoma">And that's kind of the problem.</font>

1157
01:37:29,517 --> 01:37:30,871
<font face="Tahoma">Let's give them a tour.</font>

1158
01:37:30,947 --> 01:37:32,142
<font face="Tahoma">Break on my mark.</font>

1159
01:37:32,254 --> 01:37:34,349
<font face="Tahoma">Three, two, one.</font>

1160
01:37:34,459 --> 01:37:35,459
<font face="Tahoma">Go!</font>

1161
01:37:39,418 --> 01:37:40,476
<font face="Tahoma">Splitting up won't work.</font>

1162
01:37:40,892 --> 01:37:42,504
<font face="Tahoma">You can't hide from God's Eye.</font>

1163
01:37:46,668 --> 01:37:47,668
<font face="Tahoma">In range.</font>

1164
01:37:48,035 --> 01:37:49,180
<font face="Tahoma">Ramsey, start the hack.</font>

1165
01:37:49,294 --> 01:37:50,684
<font face="Tahoma">Initiating.</font>

1166
01:37:51,777 --> 01:37:52,777
<font face="Tahoma">Now.</font>

1167
01:37:54,968 --> 01:37:57,976
<font face="Tahoma">Sir, I think someone's trying to hack the system.</font>

1168
01:37:58,053 --> 01:37:59,205
<font face="Tahoma">It's Ramsey.</font>

1169
01:37:59,318 --> 01:38:00,906
<font face="Tahoma">Send in the predator!</font>

1170
01:38:01,001 --> 01:38:02,001
<font face="Tahoma">Take her out!</font>

1171
01:38:02,025 --> 01:38:03,395
<font face="Tahoma">Releasing predator.</font>

1172
01:38:35,344 --> 01:38:36,729
<font face="Tahoma">I think we lost the chopper.</font>

1173
01:38:42,788 --> 01:38:44,514
<font face="Tahoma">I think we got bigger problems than that!</font>

1174
01:38:46,595 --> 01:38:47,867
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, my God.</font>

1175
01:38:50,181 --> 01:38:51,581
<font face="Tahoma">What are you doing?</font>

1176
01:38:51,694 --> 01:38:52,694
<font face="Tahoma">Going old school!</font>

1177
01:39:55,809 --> 01:39:56,809
<font face="Tahoma">PUBLIC PARKING</font>

1178
01:40:14,251 --> 01:40:15,466
<font face="Tahoma">It's coming back around!</font>

1179
01:40:28,405 --> 01:40:30,057
<font face="Tahoma">The predator's back on 'em.</font>

1180
01:40:30,170 --> 01:40:31,174
<font face="Tahoma">Ready missiles!</font>

1181
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:32,250
<font face="Tahoma">Roger that.</font>

1182
01:40:33,477 --> 01:40:34,477
<font face="Tahoma">Fire!</font>

1183
01:40:35,802 --> 01:40:36,802
<font face="Tahoma">Shit!</font>

1184
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:48,167
<font face="Tahoma">I need a lateral.</font>

1185
01:40:48,277 --> 01:40:49,387
<font face="Tahoma">Rom, where are you?</font>

1186
01:40:49,458 --> 01:40:51,084
<font face="Tahoma">Running back! Charging in.</font>

1187
01:41:09,728 --> 01:41:11,050
<font face="Tahoma">Meet me on Third and Spring.</font>

1188
01:41:11,127 --> 01:41:12,127
<font face="Tahoma">You got it!</font>

1189
01:41:19,107 --> 01:41:20,185
<font face="Tahoma">I'm halfway there.</font>

1190
01:41:20,266 --> 01:41:21,814
<font face="Tahoma">Grab your computer and get in the window!</font>

1191
01:41:21,889 --> 01:41:22,929
<font face="Tahoma">- Why? - Do it, now!</font>

1192
01:41:28,329 --> 01:41:29,553
<font face="Tahoma">You gotta go! Right now!</font>

1193
01:41:34,204 --> 01:41:35,204
<font face="Tahoma">Fire!</font>

1194
01:41:45,708 --> 01:41:46,708
<font face="Tahoma">No!</font>

1195
01:42:04,468 --> 01:42:05,468
<font face="Tahoma">He made it!</font>

1196
01:42:11,361 --> 01:42:13,036
<font face="Tahoma">Can't believe we pullled that off!</font>

1197
01:42:21,061 --> 01:42:22,297
<font face="Tahoma">Wait, we're still being hacked.</font>

1198
01:42:22,411 --> 01:42:22,876
<font face="Tahoma">What?</font>

1199
01:42:22,984 --> 01:42:24,503
<font face="Tahoma">God's Eye is still tracking Ramsey.</font>

1200
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:26,151
<font face="Tahoma">Keep the drone in pursuit of her.</font>

1201
01:42:26,259 --> 01:42:28,019
<font face="Tahoma">The signal has to be coming from somewhere.</font>

1202
01:43:08,046 --> 01:43:09,553
<font face="Tahoma">Breaking news out of Los 羘geles tonight.</font>

1203
01:43:09,664 --> 01:43:12,978
<font face="Tahoma">In what can only be described as vehicular warfare,</font>

1204
01:43:13,054 --> 01:43:15,178
<font face="Tahoma">police are engaged in a high speed pursuit...</font>

1205
01:43:17,595 --> 01:43:21,093
<font face="Tahoma">I got it. The piggyback in the hack off that satellite tower right there.</font>

1206
01:43:21,238 --> 01:43:22,238
<font face="Tahoma">Take it out!</font>

1207
01:43:33,824 --> 01:43:34,836
<font face="Tahoma">Toretto.</font>

1208
01:43:43,965 --> 01:43:46,338
<font face="Tahoma">Wait, what happened? We were almost there.</font>

1209
01:43:47,027 --> 01:43:48,652
<font face="Tahoma">They've cut the signal. I can't finish the hack.</font>

1210
01:43:48,755 --> 01:43:49,626
<font face="Tahoma">What do you mean?</font>

1211
01:43:51,811 --> 01:43:53,292
<font face="Tahoma">Brian, they took out the tower!</font>

1212
01:43:58,022 --> 01:44:00,111
<font face="Tahoma">Dad, what's going on?</font>

1213
01:44:01,776 --> 01:44:03,317
<font face="Tahoma">Daddy's gotta go to work.</font>

1214
01:44:21,222 --> 01:44:22,624
<font face="Tahoma">Alright, baby girl.</font>

1215
01:44:22,732 --> 01:44:24,353
<font face="Tahoma">Elena's gonna be here in a little bit.</font>

1216
01:44:24,378 --> 01:44:25,811
<font face="Tahoma">You know our drill.</font>

1217
01:44:25,911 --> 01:44:27,230
<font face="Tahoma">Give me three for the road.</font>

1218
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:47,763
<font face="Tahoma">You thought this was gonna be a street fight?</font>

1219
01:45:02,996 --> 01:45:04,580
<font face="Tahoma">You're goddamn right it is.</font>

1220
01:45:50,822 --> 01:45:52,003
<font face="Tahoma">There has to be another way.</font>

1221
01:45:52,117 --> 01:45:55,396
<font face="Tahoma">Wait. I'm seeing half a dozen cell towers between Sixth and State.</font>

1222
01:45:55,472 --> 01:45:58,178
<font face="Tahoma">Brian, if you can get to the top of any one of those buildings around there...</font>

1223
01:45:58,293 --> 01:46:00,946
<font face="Tahoma">we can reroute the signal manually and finish the job.</font>

1224
01:46:01,058 --> 01:46:02,058
<font face="Tahoma">I'm on it.</font>

1225
01:46:05,165 --> 01:46:06,389
<font face="Tahoma">Sir, did you hear that?</font>
