1
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,096
Miss Kelly, might I talk to you later?

2
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,023
Not if what you're going to say will cause trouble for me

3
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:54,038
in some way or another.

4
00:02:03,012 --> 00:02:05,019
Nine o'clock mass is over, girls.

5
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:14,059
- Now. One moment, please.  - Thank you.

6
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:22,073
Mrs. Brady, what would you like this morning?

7
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,015
Half a dozen rashers, please.

8
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,066
Of course. Eilis will get that for you now.

9
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:29,029
-I was next. - And you still are.

10
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:34,025
- Yes?  - I need some shoe polish.

11
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,037
Shoe polish?

12
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:38,035
That's not really a Sunday item now, is it?

13
00:02:38,037 --> 00:02:40,083
These people need things for their dinner or their tea.

14
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:43,036
Why couldn't you have remembered yesterday?

15
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,088
Because it looks like you needed it yesterday.

16
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:47,064
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,003
Miss. Kelly....

18
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:04,072
I haven't forgotten. Spit it out, whatever it is.

19
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:08,025
I'm away to America.

20
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:12,095
Whose idea was that?

21
00:03:12,097 --> 00:03:15,043
Father Flood in New York arranged it.

22
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:18,095
Rose used to play golf with him. He sponsored me.

23
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:20,091
He found me a job and got me a visa.

24
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:22,063
Well, we won't be needing you back here.

25
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:24,022
I could work every Sunday until I go.

26
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:25,031
No, thank you.

27
00:03:28,036 --> 00:03:31,015
- Your poor sister. - My sister?

28
00:03:31,017 --> 00:03:34,055
Oh, mothers are always being left behind in this country.

29
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:39,015
But Rose ... That's the end for her now, isn't it?

30
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:42,023
She will be looking after your mother, for the rest of her life.

31
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:59,072
I wish I had written to Father Flood about you, Rose.

32
00:03:59,074 --> 00:04:01,067
Me? I have a job.

33
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:05,065
You had a couple of hours on a Sunday working for Nettles Kelly.

34
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:06,071
You should not call her that.

35
00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:08,055
I think it's quite a kind name,

36
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:11,002
considering she's actually a terrible old witch.

37
00:04:11,035 --> 00:04:13,095
Well, I don't want to talk about her any more.

38
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:15,014
Good.

39
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,047
They say it's hotter there in the summer, and colder in the winter.

40
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:25,041
What in Heaven's name will she do about clothes?

41
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:26,044
She'll buy them, mother.

42
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:28,028
She doesn't want to be wasting her money on clothes.

43
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,041
She won't have much choice. She'll be there for...

44
00:04:46,014 --> 00:04:49,001
- You look beautiful, Nancy. - Thank you.

45
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,075
You look so beautiful it makes me despair of this place.

46
00:04:52,098 --> 00:04:54,021
Why?

47
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:56,067
Well, you're the prettiest girl in County Wexford.

48
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,070
You should be able to choose any man you want.

49
00:04:58,072 --> 00:05:02,009
And we're hoping that George Sheridan from the rugby club looks your way.

50
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,094
- Do you think he might? - Of course he will.

51
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:09,032
I know you like him, Nancy, but he's not Gary Cooper, is he?

52
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:09,032
Gary Cooper  美国演员 代表作 《约克军曹》

53
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:13,032
那些男孩们 打着发油 穿着休闲外套
And those boys with their hair-oil and their blazers…

54
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:15,006
He has beautiful eyes.

55
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:18,072
Hmm. And he's going to come into a beautiful shop in the Market Square.

56
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:22,092
Why didn't you wear your blue dress?

57
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:25,087
Are you asking why I didn't make more of an effort?

58
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,001
I suppose because I'm going away.

59
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:33,044
Come on.

60
00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:05,010
He's looked over here twice already.

61
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:06,012
He hasn't!

62
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:09,034
He's walking over here now.

63
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,045
He's not!

64
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:14,004
我为什么要骗你乔治·谢里丹在干嘛
Why would I keep lying to you about what George Sheridan’s doing?

65
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,054
Would you like to dance?

66
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:10,054
Is that really everything you own?

67
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:15,024
Oh, Eilis. I should have looked after you better.

68
00:07:15,056 --> 00:07:18,012
You've bought most of these clothes in this case.

69
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:20,077
That's one of the reasons I'm going,

70
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,037
because I can't buy my own.

71
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,043
If it was just that, I'd spend every penny I had on you, gladly.

72
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:30,047
But I can't buy you a future.

73
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,089
I can't buy you the kind of life you need.

74
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:34,021
I know.

75
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:40,017
- But you'll come see me there one day?   -Yes.

76
00:07:42,023 --> 00:07:44,077
And you'll look after yourself?

77
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,010
You don't have to worry about me.

78
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:48,017
And I'll come home to visit, won't I?

79
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,060
Because I couldn't bear it if...

80
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,038
You haven't packed your shoes yet.

81
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,001
They'll take up a bit of room.

82
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,012
There.

83
00:09:53,012 --> 00:09:54,013
I'm sorry.

84
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:07,019
Off!

85
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:09,033
Number one. Bottom bunk.

86
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:11,007
That's mine. You're on the top.

87
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:21,063
This is hell. Never again.

88
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:23,052
Never again to America?

89
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:25,074
The mistake was coming home from America in the first place.

90
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:29,086
I'd do anything to get out of this horrible cabin.

91
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:33,010
- Let's go for a smoke. - I don't.

92
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:36,059
Suit yourself. I'll see you later.

93
00:10:36,062 --> 00:10:38,094
Unless I find a nice man in First to smoke with.

94
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,056
It's good to see that not everybody's put off their dinner by the weather forecast.

95
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:04,049
It's supposed to be a rough one tonight,

96
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:06,025
so none of the other passengers are eating.

97
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:09,076
A few spoonfuls of soup, maybe, but not the mutton stew.

98
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,061
Please unlock it.

99
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,050
Go away, it is closed.

100
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:11,081
I'm sorry about the smell, and the bucket.

101
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:14,046
Don't worry. The whole boat stinks.

102
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:15,097
Even First Class.

103
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,045
I've just been thrown out of there, by the way.

104
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:20,064
The bathroom door was locked all night.

105
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,049
Oh, those bastards.

106
00:12:53,002 --> 00:12:55,040
There. It won't be very comfortable. But at least it's ours.

107
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:57,069
Open the door.

108
00:12:57,071 --> 00:13:00,098
Fuck off! Do you hear me? Fuck off!

109
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,049
If you had been nice last night, we would have played fair.

110
00:13:03,051 --> 00:13:06,037
Now you've got no toilet, you bastards.

111
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,017
Go on, you can use it. I'm gonna get us some water.

112
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:11,083
That's all you're allowed.

113
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,003
You going to live in America?

114
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:23,047
You have papers and everything?

115
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:26,007
Yes. And a job.

116
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,029
How did you manage to arrange all that?

117
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:31,093
I didn't. Someone did it for me. A priest my sister knows.

118
00:13:32,005 --> 00:13:33,096
And how do you feel about it?

119
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:41,064
How long do the letters from Ireland take to arrive?

120
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:44,020
My sister Rose said she'd write straightaway.

121
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:47,086
They take a long time at first, and then no time at all.

122
00:13:49,014 --> 00:13:51,013
You have family in America? Friends?

123
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:52,052
No.

124
00:13:52,055 --> 00:13:54,005
You'll meet people easy enough.

125
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:55,047
Where are you gonna live?

126
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:56,087
Brooklyn?

127
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:58,060
How do you know that?

128
00:13:58,063 --> 00:13:59,063
Lucky guess.

129
00:14:00,018 --> 00:14:04,027
Try to remember that sometimes it's nice to talk to people who don't know your auntie.

130
00:14:05,006 --> 00:14:06,040
That's what it's like?

131
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:07,064
That's what it's like.

132
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,056
- I've been sick for hours.  -Nice, isn't it?

133
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:19,096
I am very hungry.

134
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:21,085
Hmm, that's why you haven't been sick for hours.

135
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:24,015
We'll eat tomorrow.

136
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:26,099
Or the day after.

137
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:35,076
Oh, dear. We'll have to do something with you.

138
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:37,033
They'll put you in quarantine or something

139
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:39,020
if you try to enter the country looking like that.

140
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:43,045
Nothing fancy. You mustn't look like a tart.

141
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:47,076
Oh, Well, looking like a tart isn't going to be a problem.

142
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:51,050
This doesn't look too bad.

143
00:14:51,052 --> 00:14:52,085
My sister gave me that.

144
00:14:55,096 --> 00:15:00,016
穿这个搭一下
Wear it with this…

145
00:15:02,043 --> 00:15:03,061
and this.

146
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:10,008
Open your bags ready for inspection.

147
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:11,067
Don't look too innocent, though.

148
00:15:13,018 --> 00:15:15,041
I'll put some rouge and mascara on you.

149
00:15:17,022 --> 00:15:18,074
Perhaps some eye-liner.

150
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:34,052
You step out of the line please. Thank you. Next, please. Thank you.

151
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Passport please.

152
00:15:39,057 --> 00:15:41,015
Stand up straight.

153
00:15:41,018 --> 00:15:44,091
Polish your shoes, and don't cough whatever you do.

154
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:52,020
Don't be rude, or pushy, and don't look too nervous.

155
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,079
This way!

156
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:56,067
Think like an American.

157
00:15:58,035 --> 00:16:00,018
You have to know where you're going.

158
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:03,058
Welcome to the United States, Ma'am. Through the blue door, please.

159
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:05,051
Next, please.

160
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:52,002
Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy gifts which we are about to receive

161
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:54,026
from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, Amen.

162
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:55,029
Amen.

163
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,011
I saw you had a letter today, Diana. Any news?

164
00:17:02,013 --> 00:17:05,024
Mr. de Valera has had another operation on his eyes, she says.

165
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,004
I don't want news that I can read in a newspaper.

166
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:10,021
Anyway, we would describe Mr. de Valera as "politics",

167
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:11,051
would we not, Mrs. Kehoe?

168
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,085
And we do not like politics at the dinner table.

169
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:14,069
We don't.

170
00:17:14,071 --> 00:17:16,066
It's not politics to talk about eye operations.

171
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,077
It is if the eyes belong to a politician.

172
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:21,063
And I do not like to talk about hospitals very much, either.

173
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:24,007
Patty, did you have any luck with that cold cream?

174
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:26,031
I asked Miss Tyler in Cosmetics.

175
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,045
And I showed her the advertisement.

176
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:29,025
I don't want to have to travel all the way

177
00:17:29,027 --> 00:17:30,094
to Manhattan just for a jar of cold cream.

178
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:32,092
Maybe you could have a look at Bartocci's for me, Eilis?

179
00:17:33,024 --> 00:17:34,053
Yes, Mrs. Kehoe.

180
00:17:34,055 --> 00:17:36,025
Oh, Bartocci's is bound to have it.

181
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:38,009
She does not know for sure, Mrs. Kehoe.

182
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:40,037
She is only saying that Bartocci's is a better store than Webster's

183
00:17:40,037 --> 00:17:41,043
to get at Patty.

184
00:17:41,045 --> 00:17:42,094
They are both very good,

185
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,079
and you girls are very lucky to be working there.

186
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:50,059
Eilis, from the look of you, you have greasy skin, is that right?

187
00:17:50,062 --> 00:17:51,086
What do you do about that?

188
00:17:53,098 --> 00:17:58,041
Just... Well, I wash it, Mrs. Kehoe, with soap.

189
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,095
There is nothing wrong with soap.

190
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:02,049
Soap was good enough for our Lord. I expect.

191
00:18:02,052 --> 00:18:04,082
Well, which brand did he use, Miss McAdam?

192
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,041
Does the Bible tell you that?

193
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,026
Our Lord was a man, anyway.

194
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:09,084
He didn't care about greasy skin.

195
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:13,085
Ladies. No more talk about our Lord's complexion at dinner, please.

196
00:18:14,017 --> 00:18:16,075
The girls will help you find something suitable, Eilis, won't you, the girls?

197
00:18:36,065 --> 00:18:40,091
巴尔托奇百货

198
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:52,003
- Hi.  - Good Morning.

199
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,064
Did you go out last night?

200
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,067
- Out. The opposite of in .  - No.

201
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,050
Well, I saw a movie with my boyfriend.

202
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:05,003
"What did you see, Dorothy?"

203
00:19:05,005 --> 00:19:08,034
"I saw The Quiet Man, Eilis. They filmed it in Ireland."

204
00:19:08,036 --> 00:19:09,062
"Oh, I'm from Ireland".

205
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:13,028
"I know you are, that's why I thought you might be interested."

206
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:16,044
Thank you.

207
00:19:16,044 --> 00:19:18,044


208
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,028
Shouldn't be a moment.

209
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,055
Is it still hot out there?

210
00:19:50,077 --> 00:19:52,054
I haven't been outside since this morning

211
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:54,090
but I can tell that it might be.

212
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:58,087
Very. It just..looks it.

213
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:01,036
It's warm, yes.

214
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:12,054
Thanks very much.

215
00:20:16,022 --> 00:20:18,092
Remember ... If people like it here, they will come back.

216
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:21,066
So you treat every customer as if she's a new friend.

217
00:20:21,068 --> 00:20:22,048
I will try.

218
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:25,002
It's not a matter of trying. It's what you have to do.

219
00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:27,026
Do you try to wear panties every day?

220
00:20:28,024 --> 00:20:29,055
No.

221
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:32,050
I mean, I don't..I don't try. I just put them on.

222
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:33,093
You see what I'm saying?

223
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,028
- Yes. - Good.

224
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,008
Can I get another sliced toast please?

225
00:20:45,016 --> 00:20:46,059
Slice up some hot dog.

226
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:48,011
They want them sliced down the middle!

227
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:56,035
Sorry. Could I have the bill please?

228
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:04,008
I hope that when I go through the pearly gates,

229
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:05,038
the first sound I hear is you

230
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,034
asking me for the check in that lovely Irish brogue.

231
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:05,073
Have they told you a date for the nylon sale yet, Eilis?

232
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:08,028
We've never had a Bartocci's girl living here.

233
00:22:08,071 --> 00:22:10,083
We might get some inside information.

234
00:22:10,085 --> 00:22:12,022
I haven't been told anything.

235
00:22:12,034 --> 00:22:14,021
I'll bet you wouldn't let on if you had.

236
00:22:14,023 --> 00:22:16,073
She's that sort. More loyal to her bosses than to her friends.

237
00:22:16,075 --> 00:22:17,089
Like a Red spy.

238
00:22:17,092 --> 00:22:19,020
Oh, dear God.

239
00:22:19,073 --> 00:22:23,042
I'll thank you to keep His name out of a conversation about nylons.

240
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:27,009
He might be everywhere, but he's certainly not in Bartocci's on sale day.

241
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:28,035
Sorry Mrs. Kehoe.

242
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:31,033
I was glad to see you finally got some letters from home today, Eilis.

243
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,091
- Did I? - Em.

244
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:33,076
I forgot to check.

245
00:22:33,078 --> 00:22:36,024
They'll still be there after dinner.

246
00:22:36,027 --> 00:22:37,080
Oh sorry.

247
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:52,086
Dear Eilis,

248
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:56,028
It's hard for me to believe that you're reading this in America.

249
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,067
Thousands of miles across the sea.

250
00:22:59,075 --> 00:23:02,051
The big news here is that since you left,

251
00:23:02,054 --> 00:23:05,012
Mummy has stopped shopping at Nettles Kelly's.

252
00:23:05,014 --> 00:23:08,023
As you know, her bread wasn't always fresh.

253
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:10,007
And she overcharge for everything.

254
00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:12,031
And she's awful.

255
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:15,025
I haven't told her to her face.There's no need.

256
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:18,003
She knows that she overcharges and her bread's not fresh.

257
00:23:19,094 --> 00:23:22,078
We talk about you every evening, of course.

258
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,057
We want to know everything.

259
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:31,019
I'm sure you're busy, but even if your letters were two hundred pages,

260
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:33,017
they wouldn't be long enough for your mother.

261
00:23:39,027 --> 00:23:42,017
Take care of yourself. Love.

262
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,007
Is it your time of the month?

263
00:23:59,013 --> 00:24:00,046
So what is it?

264
00:24:05,002 --> 00:24:07,098
Take some time off now. Go and sit in the staff room.

265
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:20,021
I'm so sorry, Eilis. This is all my fault.

266
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:23,025
I was led to believe that you didn't need looking after.

267
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,090
Franco Bartocci says you are doing great here.

268
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:28,067
Ma Kehoe says you are the nicest lodger she's ever had.

269
00:24:29,021 --> 00:24:31,024
- What? - Ma Kehoe?

270
00:24:31,027 --> 00:24:33,029
Don't ever call her that to her face.

271
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:37,059
I'd forgotten just how bad it feels to be away from home.

272
00:24:37,081 --> 00:24:40,088
I've enrolled you in a night class.

273
00:24:41,011 --> 00:24:43,063
For book-keeping. The Brooklyn College.

274
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:44,092
It will be three nights a week.

275
00:24:44,095 --> 00:24:46,087
And I've paid your tuition for the first semester.

276
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:50,008
- 为什么 - 干嘛问为什么
- Why? - “Why?”

277
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,037
Not "Thank you"?

278
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,091
Sorry, thank you. But why?

279
00:24:54,094 --> 00:24:57,004
I was amazed that someone as clever as you

280
00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:59,014
couldn't find proper work at home.

281
00:25:00,017 --> 00:25:01,090
I've been here too long.

282
00:25:01,092 --> 00:25:03,098
I forget what it's like in Ireland.

283
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,028
So when your sister wrote to me about you

284
00:25:07,032 --> 00:25:09,022
I said that the Church would try to help.

285
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:13,076
Anyway, we need Irish girls in Brooklyn.

286
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:17,043
I wish that I could stop feeling that I want to be an Irish girl in Ireland.

287
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:20,055
All I can say is that it will pass.

288
00:25:21,035 --> 00:25:23,050
Homesickness is like most sicknesses.

289
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:28,007
It will make you feel wretched, and then it will move on to somebody else.

290
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,011
Now, Taylor versus Standard Gas Co

291
00:25:33,014 --> 00:25:35,028
is one of the most important corporate cases

292
00:25:35,028 --> 00:25:38,014
decided in the Supreme Court in the last twenty years.

293
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,077
This was the case responsible for the Deep Rock doctrine,

294
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,085
so it's maybe the biggest milestone in parent-subsidiary law.

295
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:50,034
In public utility integration proceedings alone

296
00:25:50,036 --> 00:25:52,066
literally thousands of investors

297
00:25:52,068 --> 00:25:54,081
may be affected by its application.

298
00:25:59,026 --> 00:26:01,086
Did you understand any of that?

299
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,099
I mean, a single word?

300
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:07,097
He's not even reading from a book.

301
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,034
He just knows all this.

302
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:13,001
Well, Let's hope the next hour is easier.

303
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:29,007
One of the things that ruins Christmas in America is the turkey.

304
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:30,094
It all tastes of sawdust.

305
00:26:30,096 --> 00:26:32,096
So that's one cheese sandwich for Miss McAdam,

306
00:26:32,096 --> 00:26:34,089
and extra turkey for everyone else.

307
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:37,063
Ladies, please.

308
00:26:39,006 --> 00:26:41,080
Eilis, Father Flood told me about your Christmas plans.

309
00:26:41,092 --> 00:26:45,014
Oh, you're not serving lunch to the old fellas who've nowhere to go, are you?

310
00:26:45,027 --> 00:26:47,075
He asks us every year. We always say no.

311
00:26:47,078 --> 00:26:49,086
Ellis, you're a saint. They smell awful.

312
00:26:49,089 --> 00:26:52,083
Sheila knows how they smell because that's where she goes husband-hunting.

313
00:26:55,061 --> 00:26:59,017
It's a marvelous thing you're doing, Eilis. A Christian thing.

314
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,094
I wish there were more like you.

315
00:27:04,077 --> 00:27:06,009
You can come.

316
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,080
How many are we expecting?

317
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:11,001
There were a hundred last year. There may be more this.

318
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:13,065
- They all Irish? - All Irish.

319
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:16,064
Why don't they go home?

320
00:27:17,065 --> 00:27:20,022
If there's nothing there for a clever young girl such as yourself,

321
00:27:20,025 --> 00:27:22,040
there's gonna be even less for men like these.

322
00:27:22,062 --> 00:27:24,090
Some of them have been here fifty years,

323
00:27:25,001 --> 00:27:27,013
they have lost touch with everyone.

324
00:27:27,016 --> 00:27:28,006
Happy Christmas.

325
00:27:28,084 --> 00:27:30,047
- Merry Christmas. - Thank you.

326
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,013
These are the men who built ...

327
00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:35,056
the tunnels, the bridges, the highways.

328
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,099
God alone knows what they live on now.

329
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:02,050
I don't want to interrupt the proceedings,

330
00:28:02,053 --> 00:28:05,087
but I'm sure you'd all like to show your appreciation

331
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:08,039
to all the ladies here for their hard day's work.

332
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:10,001
And by way of a thank you,

333
00:28:10,003 --> 00:28:12,043
we have a great singer in the room with us today.

334
00:28:12,053 --> 00:28:13,069
Frankie.

335
00:30:19,046 --> 00:30:22,014
Would you like to come into the front room for a glass of something?

336
00:30:22,047 --> 00:30:23,084
You've earned it.

337
00:30:25,087 --> 00:30:30,066
- You survived! - Oh it wasn't so bad.

338
00:30:33,055 --> 00:30:35,095
- Happy Christmas! - Cheers.

339
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:43,060
Now Miss McAdam is leaving us.

340
00:30:43,062 --> 00:30:45,090
She is going to live with her sister in Manhattan.

341
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,090
She has the best room in the house.

342
00:30:48,003 --> 00:30:52,021
The basement. And it has its own entrance.

343
00:30:52,033 --> 00:30:58,007
Now, I can only let a certain kind of girl stay there.

344
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,097
Oh, and I'm not talking about looks here.

345
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,063
Although I will admit that God did give Miss McAdam an advantage,

346
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:05,010
when I had to think about who I could trust to live down there.

347
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:09,002
No no, you're a pretty girl Eilis. But you're sensible.

348
00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:12,009
So, you're having the room and that's that.

349
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,009
Would the other girls not mind?

350
00:31:14,012 --> 00:31:17,017
Oh, I expect so. What don't they mind?

351
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,009
Girls, you'll take Dolores to dance with you on Saturday night, won't you?

352
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:27,009
There's a dance?

353
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,039
At the parish hall.

354
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:30,095
There'll be no alcohol, but you can have fun without it.

355
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:34,099
Umm, Patty and I aren't going this week.

356
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:38,003
We're going to see a movie instead.

357
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:40,071
Well, I'm sure Dolores would enjoy a movie just as well.

358
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:42,050
I would, very much.

359
00:31:42,053 --> 00:31:45,041
There are so many more movies here in New York than in Cavan.

360
00:31:45,044 --> 00:31:48,035
Yes, surprising, isn't it? You'd think it would be the other way around.

361
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:54,074
Of course, you'd be welcome to join us, Dolores.

362
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:56,096
So long as you don't mind being a gooseberry.

363
00:31:57,018 --> 00:32:01,014
So you both miraculously found boyfriends over the last couple of days, did you?

364
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:05,034
Well, I hope you have more luck with these than you did with the last few.

365
00:32:06,016 --> 00:32:08,070
- Will you be going, Eilis? - Yes, Mrs Kehoe.

366
00:32:08,073 --> 00:32:10,033
Well, you can take Dolores, then.

367
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,095
Of course.

368
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:36,088
God, there's nobody here.

369
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,028
How are we supposed to get a fella if there's nobody here?

370
00:32:40,051 --> 00:32:43,006
I expect most people will come after nine.

371
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,018
People? Or fellas?

372
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:48,051
Some of the people will be fellas.

373
00:32:49,037 --> 00:32:51,028
I'd love to meet a fella.

374
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,070
They came! The liars!

375
00:32:56,072 --> 00:32:59,016
What a pair of bitches.

376
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:04,036
That's what the old woman called them. She said they were all bitches,

377
00:33:05,065 --> 00:33:07,003
apart from you.

378
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,088
Well hello.

379
00:33:19,091 --> 00:33:22,002
Hello. It's good to see you.

380
00:33:22,004 --> 00:33:23,004
I can see why.

381
00:33:25,018 --> 00:33:26,022
Come with us.

382
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:43,039
There. That's better.

383
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:45,085
Now you don't look like you came in from milking the cows.

384
00:33:46,022 --> 00:33:47,064
Is that what I looked like?

385
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:51,007
Just a bit. Nice clean cows.

386
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:56,053
1, 2, 3 ...

387
00:33:58,042 --> 00:33:59,052
Not bad.

388
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,091
Maybe we could have a dance later?

389
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:14,019
- Sorry? - A dance later.

390
00:34:14,021 --> 00:34:15,080
Oh sure.

391
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:17,090
Would you like to dance?

392
00:34:30,056 --> 00:34:33,091
Are you here with that guy? The one who was teaching you to dance?

393
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:35,044
No.

394
00:34:35,047 --> 00:34:36,084
So would you dance with me?

395
00:34:37,046 --> 00:34:39,074
I'm not sure he taught me anything.

396
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:43,017
Doesn't matter. The secret is to look as though you know what you're doing.

397
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:45,093
Ah. I wish someone had told me that years ago.

398
00:34:48,007 --> 00:34:49,018
Come on.

399
00:35:21,072 --> 00:35:26,029
- Where do you live? - Clinton Street.

400
00:35:26,061 --> 00:35:29,057
Yeah? That's on my way home.

401
00:35:31,036 --> 00:35:32,081
Can I walk you?

402
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:37,008
I'm going to say yes, and then I'm going to tell you why.

403
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,013
So I don't get the wrong idea?

404
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:40,039
I suppose so.

405
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:44,021
Is there a girl in a white shirt

406
00:35:44,023 --> 00:35:45,075
sitting on her own over there?

407
00:35:49,088 --> 00:35:51,043
You don't know her?

408
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:52,091
I do.

409
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:56,057
She lives in my boarding house, and she's awful.

410
00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:59,014
If I leave with you, I'm sure she'd understand.

411
00:35:59,014 --> 00:36:00,031
You'd be rescuing me.

412
00:36:00,064 --> 00:36:02,001
I get it.

413
00:36:23,028 --> 00:36:27,016
- I'm not Irish. - You don't sound Irish.

414
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:33,073
I need to make this clear. No part of me is Irish.

415
00:36:33,075 --> 00:36:36,086
I don't have Irish parents or grandparents or anything.

416
00:36:36,098 --> 00:36:40,043
I'm an Italian. Well, my my parents are, anyway.

417
00:36:40,045 --> 00:36:42,035
So what were you doing at an Irish dance?

418
00:36:42,038 --> 00:36:44,030
Don't the Italians have dances?

419
00:36:44,033 --> 00:36:46,083
Yeah. And I wouldn't want to take you to one.

420
00:36:46,086 --> 00:36:48,091
They behave like Italians all night.

421
00:36:48,093 --> 00:36:50,008
What does that mean?

422
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,053
- Oh, you know. - No.

423
00:36:53,071 --> 00:36:56,052
- Hands. - Too many of them?

424
00:36:56,052 --> 00:36:59,056
Oh,my. I guess it could seem that way, if it was a girl.

425
00:36:59,089 --> 00:37:01,009
Listen

426
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:05,065
I want everything out in the open.

427
00:37:05,068 --> 00:37:12,074
I came to the Irish dance because I really like Irish girls.

428
00:37:13,072 --> 00:37:15,078
And I was the only one who would dance with you?

429
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:17,032
Oh, no, it wasn't...

430
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,041
Oh, so you danced with loads of others?

431
00:37:29,017 --> 00:37:30,047
This is me.

432
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:37,020
Can I take you next week? Maybe get something to eat first?

433
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:40,077
That'd be nice.

434
00:37:42,071 --> 00:37:43,086
Good night.

435
00:37:56,097 --> 00:37:57,098
There you go.

436
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:08,079
So...What do you do when you're not working?

437
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:15,069
Well. There's school. Just, you know...Brooklyn College.

438
00:38:15,071 --> 00:38:17,062
I'm studying book-keeping.

439
00:38:17,065 --> 00:38:19,015
You want to be a book-keeper?

440
00:38:19,078 --> 00:38:24,019
Well, I want to be an accountant one day. But, yes, book-keeping first.

441
00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:27,076
Wow. Is that difficult?

442
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:31,077
I'm talking too much. Tell me about plumbing.

443
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:34,068
- You know enough about plumbing already. - I don't know anything.

444
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:40,022
You know that taps drip and toilets get blocked

445
00:38:40,024 --> 00:38:42,005
and that's all you need to know.

446
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:44,016
I don't know anything about book-keeping.

447
00:38:48,032 --> 00:38:50,055
Well.There's a lot to it.

448
00:38:50,057 --> 00:38:51,056
There's all the maths, of course,

449
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,042
but that's not so complicated.

450
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:56,018
The double entry system, that takes a while to get used to.

451
00:38:56,021 --> 00:38:59,064
And we study company law, too, and that terrifies me.

452
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:03,059
So we had to read about an insurance company that went bankrupt in the 1930s,

453
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:05,085
and all the the legal issues that went along with that...

454
00:39:05,088 --> 00:39:08,022
She plays golf, and she's really good at it.

455
00:39:08,024 --> 00:39:10,073
And if she'd been at the dance last Saturday,then...

456
00:39:10,074 --> 00:39:14,036
I don't think you'd have looked at me twice, because Rose is beautiful.

457
00:39:16,056 --> 00:39:18,071
I'm worried you haven't eaten anything.

458
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:21,092
Too busy talking.

459
00:39:30,055 --> 00:39:33,024
What is the matter with you girls now?

460
00:39:33,026 --> 00:39:35,001
Nothing is matter with us, Mrs Kehoe.

461
00:39:35,003 --> 00:39:37,074
Is this all because Eilis has found herself a young man?

462
00:39:37,077 --> 00:39:39,045
Eilis'  young man?

463
00:39:39,047 --> 00:39:42,041
We didn't know. She won't say anything about it.

464
00:39:42,043 --> 00:39:45,086
And why should she, to you awful gossip-mongers?

465
00:39:46,078 --> 00:39:48,072
Anyway, I met him on Saturday night ...

466
00:39:48,075 --> 00:39:51,053
when he called for Eilis, and he is a gentleman.

467
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,081
Will you tell us what you know about him, Mrs Kehoe?

468
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:55,036
We know he's quite nice-looking.

469
00:39:55,036 --> 00:39:56,098
I didn't like his shoes much.

470
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,087
What on earth is wrong with the shoes?

471
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,049
They were a funny color.

472
00:40:02,061 --> 00:40:03,093
I'll tell you this much:

473
00:40:03,095 --> 00:40:07,073
I am going to ask Father Flood to preach a sermon on the dangers of giddiness.

474
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:10,096
I see now that giddiness is the eighth deadly sin.

475
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:16,046
A giddy girl is every bit as evil as a slothful man,

476
00:40:16,048 --> 00:40:19,046
and the noise she makes is a lot worse. Now, enough.

477
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:30,067
Yeah. Think about it. You can...

478
00:40:31,048 --> 00:40:32,048
Yeah,yeah.

479
00:40:43,071 --> 00:40:45,071
All I want to do is travel home with you.

480
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:48,031
No food, no drink, no nothing.

481
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:51,027
I know you got to study and get some sleep.

482
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,021
I'll take you to your house and say goodnight.

483
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:58,047
Otherwise, it's too long to wait.

484
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:09,053
I want to ask you something. And you're gonna say, "oh, it's too soon."

485
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:12,082
"I don't really know him well enough, we've only been out a couple times."

486
00:41:12,084 --> 00:41:15,061
Oh, it's nothing so bad. It is just something that most guys...

487
00:41:15,063 --> 00:41:18,077
Please just ask. You're beginning to terrify me.

488
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:24,077
Oh. Sure. Will you come for dinner and meet my family sometime?

489
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:27,064
That's it?

490
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:30,000
I'd love to.

491
00:41:32,065 --> 00:41:34,023
You like italian food?

492
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,025
Don't know. I've never eaten it.

493
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:37,085
It is the best food in the world.

494
00:41:37,088 --> 00:41:39,044
Well, why would not I like it?

495
00:41:41,019 --> 00:41:42,057
You're in a good mood, huh?

496
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:45,035
Yes, why?

497
00:41:45,038 --> 00:41:51,090
It's just... I like how you're being, I don't know the word.

498
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,069
When you go along with everything.

499
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,021
Amenable?

500
00:41:56,023 --> 00:41:59,061
Yeah. Amenable. OK,

501
00:41:59,064 --> 00:42:01,081
so while you're being amenable..

502
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:05,035
Can we go see a movie this week when you're not in night classes?

503
00:42:07,088 --> 00:42:09,094
I'll sign up for two movies.

504
00:42:09,097 --> 00:42:12,013
- Really? - Yes.

505
00:42:12,035 --> 00:42:14,036
Even if the first date is a disaster,

506
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,081
I'll give it another chance.

507
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:30,059
It certainly feels like it,

508
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:32,087
but this is my first year, so I don't know how to judge.

509
00:42:32,088 --> 00:42:35,075
Well congratulations. You survived your first New York winter.

510
00:42:35,077 --> 00:42:37,033
Ah, it wasn't so bad.

511
00:42:37,035 --> 00:42:38,095
Really? It's colder in Ireland?

512
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,037
Oh no, it's colder here.

513
00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:43,087
Over here, that's how we judge the winter. On how cold it is.

514
00:42:43,087 --> 00:42:48,000
But you have heating. Heating everywhere. You're only cold outside.

515
00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:49,080
I guess that's true.

516
00:42:50,073 --> 00:42:53,009
- Thank you for your help. - Have a good day.

517
00:42:56,054 --> 00:43:00,020
Eilis! You're like a different person!

518
00:43:00,022 --> 00:43:01,026
How did you do it?

519
00:43:01,026 --> 00:43:04,055
Maybe I can pass some advice on to the next poor girl who feels that way.

520
00:43:04,062 --> 00:43:07,022
I met somebody. An Italian fella.

521
00:43:07,024 --> 00:43:09,070
Oh no. I'm not passing that on.

522
00:43:09,072 --> 00:43:12,016
I'd rather have them homesick than heartbroken.

523
00:43:12,034 --> 00:43:15,014
Does he talk about baseball all the time? Or his mother?

524
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:16,012
No.

525
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:20,017
Then keep him. There isn't another Italian man like him in New York.

526
00:43:23,092 --> 00:43:28,066
Hold it. Now remember You're getting off easy, because we haven't got sauce.

527
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:33,008
Yeah. You have to remember that the sauce flies everywhere, so take it slowly.

528
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,049
I'm gonna say "Splash" anytime I see problems.

529
00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:39,003
- Good idea. - Can I start now?

530
00:43:39,025 --> 00:43:40,051
- Yeah! - Go!

531
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:56,035
SPLASH!

532
00:43:57,059 --> 00:44:01,016
You just splashed his mother, and his father, and the walls...

533
00:44:01,018 --> 00:44:02,062
Let's go again.

534
00:44:04,077 --> 00:44:07,078
Dear Rose, I suppose the most important news

535
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,089
is that I have a boyfriend

536
00:44:10,062 --> 00:44:12,082
He isn't as important as Bartocci's ...

537
00:44:12,085 --> 00:44:14,066
and my evening classes, I know that.

538
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,085
But I wanted to tell you everything that is going on.

539
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:19,073
Please don't mention it to Mummy though. You know what's she like.

540
00:44:20,096 --> 00:44:25,074
He's decent and kind, and he has a job, and he works hard.

541
00:44:25,077 --> 00:44:27,054
We go to the cinema on Wednesdays

542
00:44:27,054 --> 00:44:30,026
and he takes me to Father Flood's dance on Saturdays.

543
00:44:32,043 --> 00:44:35,017
I think of you and mother every single day.

544
00:44:35,096 --> 00:44:39,021
But Tony has helped me to feel that I have a life here.

545
00:44:39,023 --> 00:44:41,024
I didn't have before I met him.

546
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:46,021
My body was here, but my life was back in Ireland with you.

547
00:44:47,013 --> 00:44:49,043
Now it's halfway across the sea.

548
00:44:49,075 --> 00:44:51,065
So that's something, isn't it?

549
00:45:05,051 --> 00:45:07,078
对了 我得提醒你小心弗兰基
Oh and I’d better warned you about Frankie.

550
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,081
He's the little one.

551
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:10,046
Yeah. He's eight going on eighteen.

552
00:45:10,048 --> 00:45:13,018
He's nice and he's smart, but he's been talking

553
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,072
and he's talking about all the things he's gonna to say to you.

554
00:45:15,074 --> 00:45:18,048
- What sorts of things? - We don't know. Could be anything.

555
00:45:18,051 --> 00:45:20,088
I mean, I swear I tried to pay him money to

556
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:22,056
go out and play ball with his friends.

557
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:24,025
And my dad, he threatened him,

558
00:45:24,027 --> 00:45:26,093
but I think he's looking forward to causing trouble

559
00:45:26,096 --> 00:45:29,022
so much so he'll happily take a beating.

560
00:45:29,045 --> 00:45:30,088
This is us here.

561
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,026
Ready?

562
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:51,012
Hey, how did you learn to eat spaghetti like that?

563
00:45:53,002 --> 00:45:54,077
I've been taking lessons.

564
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,095
Lessons? Like, in a class? You can do that?

565
00:45:58,017 --> 00:45:59,045
Maybe I could teach you.

566
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:02,090
No, no. Diana, who lives in the boarding house with me...

567
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:06,029
cooked me some spaghetti and made me try and eat it without making a mess.

568
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:10,032
So, what do you eat in Ireland? Just Irish stew?

569
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:12,003
Not just. We...

570
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:14,076
So first of all I should say that we don't like Irish people.

571
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,040
Hey, hey ...

572
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:16,093
- Frankie! - What?

573
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,044
We don't! That is a well known fact!

574
00:46:19,046 --> 00:46:20,099
Why Frankie?

575
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:23,013
Because a big gang of Irish beat Maurizio up

576
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:24,066
and he had to get stitches.

577
00:46:24,068 --> 00:46:26,051
And because all the cops round here are Irish,

578
00:46:26,055 --> 00:46:28,039
nobody did anything about it.

579
00:46:28,086 --> 00:46:30,098
There are probably two sides to it.

580
00:46:30,098 --> 00:46:34,078
I might have said something I shouldn't, you know, I can't remember now.

581
00:46:34,078 --> 00:46:36,011
No, because they beat you up.

582
00:46:36,012 --> 00:46:39,015
Anyway, they probably weren't all Irish.

583
00:46:39,017 --> 00:46:41,008
No. They just had red hair and big legs.

584
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:44,047
Raise up! Excuse us.

585
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:50,022
All I can say in his defence is that he's the only one of us who'll get a college education.

586
00:46:50,022 --> 00:46:52,061
If he can keep his mouth shut.

587
00:46:52,094 --> 00:46:56,014
So, Tony tells me go to college.

588
00:46:56,017 --> 00:46:58,061
Oh, just night classes. I want to be a book-keeper.

589
00:46:58,063 --> 00:47:00,034
I like working in the shop well enough,

590
00:47:00,037 --> 00:47:02,004
but I don't want to be there forever.

591
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:03,092
Good.

592
00:47:04,094 --> 00:47:09,039
I'm sorry, Eilis. I'm an idiot.I'm a rude idiot.

593
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:19,022
So has Tony offered to take you to Ebbett's Field when the season starts?

594
00:47:20,098 --> 00:47:22,024
You like baseball?

595
00:47:23,086 --> 00:47:27,042
He never mentioned the Dodgers? Not even once?

596
00:47:27,042 --> 00:47:28,047
Tony, what is the matter with you?

597
00:47:28,047 --> 00:47:30,052
You know why? Too much of this.

598
00:47:31,065 --> 00:47:35,069
Anyway, you'll have to go to Ebbett's Field if you want to see him in the summer.

599
00:47:35,071 --> 00:47:37,043
They're that important to you?

600
00:47:37,045 --> 00:47:38,060
Put it this way.

601
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:42,060
If our kids end up supporting the Yankees or the Giants, it would break my heart.

602
00:47:42,063 --> 00:47:43,063
Mine too.

603
00:47:47,012 --> 00:47:49,093
She's not laughing, Tony. I think it's too late.

604
00:47:49,095 --> 00:47:51,044
She's a Yanks fan.

605
00:47:51,046 --> 00:47:55,016
What are you talking about? What's wrong with you?

606
00:47:55,068 --> 00:47:57,038
He's a Yanks fan.

607
00:48:19,028 --> 00:48:20,045
I love you.

608
00:48:23,097 --> 00:48:31,006
I..Thank you for the evening. It was lovely.

609
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:55,008
Sorry!

610
00:48:57,062 --> 00:48:58,097
I'd finished.

611
00:49:07,012 --> 00:49:09,020
Sheila can I ask you something?

612
00:49:11,006 --> 00:49:12,070
Why are not you married?

613
00:49:16,018 --> 00:49:18,097
Because my husband met somebody else and left me.

614
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:22,043
Oh I'm sorry.

615
00:49:23,098 --> 00:49:27,033
And ... Well, would you get married again?

616
00:49:27,035 --> 00:49:31,075
- Has somebody asked you? - No, not really.

617
00:49:32,008 --> 00:49:33,064
I won't ask what that means.

618
00:49:34,003 --> 00:49:35,012
Sheila?

619
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:36,090
Would I get married again?

620
00:49:36,093 --> 00:49:40,067
No. I want to be waiting outside the bathroom of my boarding-house, forever.

621
00:49:41,031 --> 00:49:43,046
Of course, I do.

622
00:49:43,049 --> 00:49:45,060
That's why I go to that wretched dance every week.

623
00:49:46,002 --> 00:49:48,055
I want to be waiting outside my own bathroom.

624
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:51,079
While some bad-tempered fella,

625
00:49:51,082 --> 00:49:53,060
with hair growing out of his ears

626
00:49:53,063 --> 00:49:55,060
reads the newspaper on the toilet.

627
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:59,066
And then I'll wish I was back here, talking to you.

628
00:50:18,036 --> 00:50:19,073
I'll catch you tomorrow right?

629
00:50:41,026 --> 00:50:45,026
Eilis! I'm sorry!

630
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:47,018
I did not think you were coming.

631
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:49,011
I know. I thought you were gonna think that.

632
00:50:49,014 --> 00:50:51,028
That's why I wanted to be here. No matter what.

633
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:53,019
I need to say something...

634
00:50:53,021 --> 00:50:55,003
Can you... Can we talk about something else ...

635
00:50:55,017 --> 00:50:56,084
until we get to Ms. Kehoe?

636
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,056
- It's Not ... - Please?

637
00:51:01,037 --> 00:51:06,048
So. Ten minutes before I'm supposed meet you ...

638
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:10,015
and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.

639
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:14,032
Yes. Even if you were thinking of inviting me in for a coffee.

640
00:51:14,035 --> 00:51:16,000
I would have to say no, for your sake.

641
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:18,045
So how did you fix it in ten minutes?

642
00:51:18,048 --> 00:51:21,000
I didn't. I spent the whole ten minutes explaining to the old lady

643
00:51:21,002 --> 00:51:22,078
that I had to be somewhere and I'd be back.

644
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,082
She didn't want to let me go.

645
00:51:24,084 --> 00:51:27,052
So the sewage is still pouring through the ceiling?

646
00:51:27,069 --> 00:51:32,004
Oh, what's the difference between six inches of sewage and a foot?

647
00:51:33,077 --> 00:51:38,048
Let me say what I want to say. I don't think you'll mind.

648
00:51:39,014 --> 00:51:40,052
Okay.

649
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:48,062
You remember that after I had dinner at your house, you told me you loved me.

650
00:51:51,034 --> 00:51:53,057
Well, I didn't really know what to say.

651
00:51:55,061 --> 00:51:57,042
But I know what to say now.

652
00:51:59,051 --> 00:52:03,094
I have thought about you. And I like you,

653
00:52:04,077 --> 00:52:09,081
and I like being with you and ...

654
00:52:11,075 --> 00:52:15,009
Maybe, I feel the same way.

655
00:52:16,073 --> 00:52:19,033
So the next time you tell me you love me,

656
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:21,034
if there is a next time ...

657
00:52:23,036 --> 00:52:25,045
I'll say I love you too.

658
00:52:29,004 --> 00:52:32,047
- Are you serious? - Yes.

659
00:52:35,013 --> 00:52:38,071
Holy shit! Excuse my language, but...

660
00:52:38,093 --> 00:52:42,009
I thought we were having a different kind of talk.

661
00:52:42,071 --> 00:52:44,056
Can I go home now?

662
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:46,087
- You love Me? - Yes.

663
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,071
But don't ask me anything else,

664
00:52:48,071 --> 00:52:51,011
and don't talk about our kids being Dodgers fans.

665
00:52:51,013 --> 00:52:53,030
Oh what? You want kids who like the Yankees?

666
00:52:53,032 --> 00:52:55,060
Tony, please don't push me.

667
00:52:55,063 --> 00:52:57,007
All right. I'm sorry.

668
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,010
Dear Eilis,

669
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:03,042
Thank you so much for the nylons.

670
00:53:03,044 --> 00:53:06,084
The Bartocci wrapping paper makes them look so glamorous.

671
00:53:08,007 --> 00:53:11,085
It seems everything is so exciting and new compared to here.

672
00:53:12,086 --> 00:53:15,080
I can't wait for you to show it all to me one day.

673
00:53:19,086 --> 00:53:25,011
Oh Eilis, you know I'm by your side, even when I'm not.

674
00:53:47,031 --> 00:53:54,004
Well. You're marvelous, that's all I have to say.

675
00:53:54,041 --> 00:53:57,040
And it looks to me as if you didn't just pass those exams.

676
00:53:58,057 --> 00:54:00,092
You, you flew through them.

677
00:54:00,094 --> 00:54:03,099
I can't remember the last time anyone came here with good news.

678
00:54:04,021 --> 00:54:06,004
I've saved some money.

679
00:54:06,007 --> 00:54:09,010
I'll be able to pay for next year's tuition and pay you back for last year.

680
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:10,090
One of my parishioners paid.

681
00:54:10,093 --> 00:54:14,052
He needed to do something for mankind, and I won't tell you why.

682
00:54:14,055 --> 00:54:15,067
He is not out of the woods yet, either.

683
00:54:15,071 --> 00:54:17,037
so he can cough up for next year, too.

684
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,043
I'd love to know what sort of woods he's in.

685
00:54:19,046 --> 00:54:21,049
Yes, I'm sure you would, but you won't hear it from me.

686
00:54:23,012 --> 00:54:26,033
Qualifications and a boyfriend, Eilis.

687
00:54:26,036 --> 00:54:29,024
You're not the miserable young girl who wanted to go home last winter.

688
00:54:29,056 --> 00:54:31,068
Seems like years ago.

689
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:36,041
Now, I think this is the first time ...

690
00:54:36,043 --> 00:54:38,026
any girl of mine

691
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:41,042
has ever passed an exam, while living here.

692
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:46,046
Have you told Tony yet, Eilis?

693
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:47,028
Of course.

694
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:48,060
And is he taking you out to celebrate?

695
00:54:48,062 --> 00:54:50,059
We're going to Coney Island at the weekend.

696
00:54:50,082 --> 00:54:53,030
- Oh, boy! - What does that mean?

697
00:54:53,033 --> 00:54:54,086
Do you have a bathing costume?

698
00:54:54,088 --> 00:54:57,012
- No, I was going to get one... - Do you have sunglasses?

699
00:54:57,014 --> 00:54:58,097
- No. - You need sunglasses.

700
00:54:58,099 --> 00:55:00,024
I read that if you don't have them on the beach this year

701
00:55:00,028 --> 00:55:02,000
people will talk about you.

702
00:55:02,028 --> 00:55:05,035
And what exactly will they say, Sheila?

703
00:55:05,037 --> 00:55:07,003
That's the thing, Mrs. Kehoe.

704
00:55:07,006 --> 00:55:09,095
You'd never know, because they'd never say it to your face.

705
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,036
Oh, dear God!

706
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:17,025
Diana's right, though, Eilis. You need to think carefully about your costume.

707
00:55:17,027 --> 00:55:20,025
It's the most Tony will ever have seen of you. You don't want to put him off.

708
00:55:25,064 --> 00:55:26,095
You'll have to shave down there.

709
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:28,077
I'll give you a razor that will do the trick.

710
00:55:34,009 --> 00:55:35,082
You're all right there for the moment.

711
00:55:35,084 --> 00:55:38,007
And most Italian men appreciate the fuller figure.

712
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,063
But watch yourself, over the summer.

713
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:44,003
The black's too dark for your pale skin.

714
00:55:44,006 --> 00:55:45,010
Let's see you in the green.

715
00:56:11,032 --> 00:56:12,047
Look at that thing.

716
00:56:25,068 --> 00:56:28,080
Why didn't you tell me to put my costume on underneath my clothes?

717
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:30,043
I thought you'd know.

718
00:56:32,086 --> 00:56:34,040
Right, I'm ready.

719
00:56:43,012 --> 00:56:45,000
- Tony! - What?

720
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,049
Come on.

721
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:51,051
Dear Rose, Thanks for your letter.

722
00:56:51,054 --> 00:56:54,034
I was happy to hear about your golf tournament.

723
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:56,004
You must have been really pleased.

724
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:58,092
I still miss you and mother,

725
00:56:58,095 --> 00:57:00,074
and I think about you every day.

726
00:57:00,076 --> 00:57:04,027
But I think I can say that for the first time since I've been in America,

727
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:06,027
I'm really happy.

728
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,027
This is a lot to do with Tony.

729
00:57:09,029 --> 00:57:12,000
At the weekend he took me to see the Brooklyn Dodgers,

730
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,003
the baseball team he loves.

731
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,087
They lost, so he was annoyed.

732
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:19,090
But I've also started to look for office work, too.

733
00:57:19,092 --> 00:57:21,019
I had an interview this week ...

734
00:57:21,022 --> 00:57:23,029
at a textile firm here in Brooklyn.

735
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:25,002
Rose?

736
00:57:25,004 --> 00:57:28,046
Who'd have thought that there would be two book-keepers in the family?

737
00:57:28,086 --> 00:57:30,015
Rose?

738
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:36,051
I'll soon be able to afford to come home and see you and mummy.

739
00:57:40,001 --> 00:57:41,021
Rose!

740
00:57:45,024 --> 00:57:47,075
Rose? Oh my God!

741
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,037
Oh God!

742
00:57:49,086 --> 00:57:51,030
Rose?

743
00:57:51,032 --> 00:57:52,098
Oh no!

744
00:58:10,018 --> 00:58:11,049
A moment.

745
00:58:32,094 --> 00:58:38,017
It was sudden. I think perhaps she was ill,

746
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:41,060
and she knew she was ill, and she didn't tell anybody.

747
00:58:46,076 --> 00:58:48,007
What will happen?

748
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:49,073
What can happen?

749
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:54,043
- When will they bury her? - Tomorrow.

750
00:58:56,059 --> 00:58:59,008
- Without me. - Without you.

751
00:59:00,016 --> 00:59:02,005
You're too far away, Eilis.

752
00:59:07,022 --> 00:59:09,013
Why did I ever come here?

753
00:59:10,003 --> 00:59:12,046
Rose wanted a better life for you.

754
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,034
She loved how well you were doing.

755
00:59:14,036 --> 00:59:16,034
But I will never see her again.

756
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,072
That's right, isn't it, Father? I will never see her again.

757
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:26,047
You know that I think you will.

758
00:59:27,062 --> 00:59:30,079
And she will be watching over you, every day, for the rest of your life.

759
00:59:58,073 --> 01:00:00,083
Hello? Mommy?

760
01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:05,008
Can you hear me now? Hello?

761
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:07,043
I can't really hear you.

762
01:00:08,096 --> 01:00:11,050
Well, the rain held off, anyway.

763
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:16,045
And the whole of her golf club came. Every single one of them.

764
01:00:17,038 --> 01:00:19,064
We had a real houseful afterwards.

765
01:00:22,091 --> 01:00:24,049
Are you still there?

766
01:00:25,062 --> 01:00:26,086
Yes.

767
01:00:29,086 --> 01:00:31,070
People really loved her, Eilis.

768
01:00:33,008 --> 01:00:35,040
Her friends from work, the neighbours, everybody.

769
01:00:38,078 --> 01:00:40,040
Nobody knew what to say to me.

770
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:48,022
When your daddy died, I said to myself that I shouldn't grieve too much

771
01:00:48,022 --> 01:00:49,057
because I had the two of you.

772
01:00:51,003 --> 01:00:53,046
Then when you went to America, I told myself the same thing

773
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:55,012
because she was here with me.

774
01:00:55,086 --> 01:00:58,039
But everyone's gone, Eilis. I have nobody.

775
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,003
I can't bear it, Tony.

776
01:01:26,076 --> 01:01:31,099
You wanna go home, I guess.

777
01:01:35,016 --> 01:01:37,084
And how would it be for you, if I did go home?

778
01:01:38,044 --> 01:01:42,022
I'll be afraid, every single day.

779
01:01:42,082 --> 01:01:49,023
- Afraid that I wouldn't come back? - Yes. Home is home.

780
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,041
I'm not sure if I have a home anymore.

781
01:02:03,024 --> 01:02:05,018
You are not going to work tomorrow, are you?

782
01:02:06,088 --> 01:02:09,083
After the Mass, can I take you somewhere?

783
01:02:22,051 --> 01:02:23,089
This is it.

784
01:02:25,043 --> 01:02:28,062
We're gonna build five houses here, if we can.

785
01:02:28,065 --> 01:02:31,011
And mom and dad, they are gonna have one,

786
01:02:31,019 --> 01:02:33,057
Cos ma always wanted a house with a backyard.

787
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:38,015
We'll sell three. And the other one...

788
01:02:38,067 --> 01:02:43,023
My brothers they asked me if I wanted it and I said that I did.

789
01:02:43,026 --> 01:02:46,064
So, I guess what I'm saying is

790
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:48,068
if you want to live out here on Long Island?

791
01:02:49,035 --> 01:02:51,062
I mean I know it doesn't look like much right now,

792
01:02:51,064 --> 01:02:53,040
but all the land around here has been sold,

793
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:55,094
so we wouldn't be on our own.

794
01:02:55,097 --> 01:02:59,066
And there would be telephone cables, electricity and everything.

795
01:03:07,026 --> 01:03:09,072
We're gonna set up a company,

796
01:03:09,094 --> 01:03:12,054
a building company, the three of us.

797
01:03:12,096 --> 01:03:17,019
And I'm gonna do the plumbing and  Lawrence is gonna do the carpentry.

798
01:03:24,021 --> 01:03:26,020
Don't go all quiet on me.

799
01:03:27,026 --> 01:03:29,023
At least tell me you'll think about it.

800
01:03:33,088 --> 01:03:36,002
I don't need to think about it.

801
01:04:27,042 --> 01:04:33,048
It's just for a month or so. I know it would make her feel a little better.

802
01:04:42,091 --> 01:04:45,003
Will you marry me before you leave?

803
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,060
You don't trust me to come back?

804
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:57,061
Marry me! Marry me!

805
01:04:58,092 --> 01:05:00,093
We don't have to tell anyone.

806
01:05:00,095 --> 01:05:04,061
We just do it quickly, just keep it between us.

807
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:09,018
Why do you want to do it?

808
01:05:10,068 --> 01:05:13,069
Because if we don't, I am gonna go crazy.

809
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,093
Would a promise not be the same?

810
01:05:24,062 --> 01:05:28,035
If you can promise, you can easily do this.

811
01:06:12,022 --> 01:06:16,008
So this is it? This is where you live?

812
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:20,011
Yes, and if you make one tiny noise she'll evict me.

813
01:07:39,025 --> 01:07:41,047
Oh, man! Oh, man!

814
01:07:53,044 --> 01:07:59,013
Oh, there's no point in worrying now. Stay with me.

815
01:08:30,029 --> 01:08:32,074
- Do you want to play? - Yes, sure.

816
01:08:32,076 --> 01:08:35,071
Alright. Here we go, one bat coming up.

817
01:08:36,088 --> 01:08:39,023
I'll take that, alright. You ready? Hands up.

818
01:08:41,048 --> 01:08:43,095
Oh, right down to the third-base line.

819
01:08:43,098 --> 01:08:45,076
Is he annoying you? Because he is annoying me.

820
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:50,009
No no no. I got a brother the exact same age? Hey, are you Irish?

821
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:51,038
Is it so obvious?

822
01:08:51,041 --> 01:08:53,049
I'm just about to marry an Irish girl,

823
01:08:53,053 --> 01:08:54,086
so I guess I notice it more.

824
01:08:54,089 --> 01:08:56,056
There are a lot of you in Brooklyn.

825
01:08:56,059 --> 01:08:58,093
Sometimes it seems as though there can't be anybody left at home.

826
01:08:58,095 --> 01:09:00,012
Where is your girl from?

827
01:09:00,015 --> 01:09:02,026
Enniscorthy, in County Wexford.

828
01:09:02,028 --> 01:09:03,053
I think my wife has family there.

829
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,095
Hey, Eilis! Come here for a second.

830
01:09:05,097 --> 01:09:09,056
Anthony Fiorello and Eilis Lacey.

831
01:09:22,065 --> 01:09:25,005
Will we ever tell our children we did this?

832
01:09:26,068 --> 01:09:29,013
Maybe we'll save it for some anniversary.

833
01:09:31,029 --> 01:09:32,086
I wonder what they'll think of it.

834
01:09:59,001 --> 01:10:00,021
Nancy!

835
01:10:00,023 --> 01:10:01,067
You look so glamorous!

836
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:02,096
I told you so.

837
01:10:03,086 --> 01:10:08,030
- I'm so sorry about Rose. - Thank you. How are you?

838
01:10:10,048 --> 01:10:11,057
No!

839
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:14,005
I knew. But I wanted to let Nancy tell you herself.

840
01:10:14,008 --> 01:10:17,013
- I am so glad you can come to the wedding. - Can l?

841
01:10:17,015 --> 01:10:19,062
Your mother accepted the invitation on your behalf.

842
01:10:20,073 --> 01:10:23,020
- When is it? - The 27th of August.

843
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:25,054
Will you come out with George and me tomorrow night?

844
01:10:25,057 --> 01:10:27,024
Annette wants to see you, too.

845
01:10:27,027 --> 01:10:28,077
Oh, I don't mind.

846
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,072
I'll have to find you a key.

847
01:10:29,076 --> 01:10:31,024
I don't want you getting me out of bed.

848
01:10:31,048 --> 01:10:34,016
We all want to hear what life in New York is like.

849
01:10:34,049 --> 01:10:36,030
I'll try and think of something to say.

850
01:10:44,024 --> 01:10:46,073
I'm booked to go back to New York on twenty-first.

851
01:10:47,065 --> 01:10:50,041
Oh, you can wait an extra week to see your best friend married.

852
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:30,072
I can't believe I'm married to someone you'll never know.

853
01:11:36,054 --> 01:11:40,078
But you'd like him. I know you would.

854
01:11:44,018 --> 01:11:47,098
He's sweet. He's funny.

855
01:11:49,026 --> 01:11:51,098
而且他的眼睛非常美
And he has got these wonderful eyes that…

856
01:12:04,015 --> 01:12:06,045
我好希望事情不是现在这样
I wish everything were different…

857
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:29,017
So, now. Mrs. O'Toole from Cush.

858
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,056
Do we really have to do this?

859
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:34,011
Getting a letter of condolence isn't like getting a birthday present, is it?

860
01:12:34,031 --> 01:12:36,037
What if Mrs. O'Toole from Cush writes back

861
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:37,093
To thank you for your thank you?

862
01:12:37,095 --> 01:12:39,040
Then I'll thank her.

863
01:12:39,042 --> 01:12:41,067
And you'll be happy to spend the rest of your life like that?

864
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:43,044
It's not as if I have anything else to do.

865
01:12:43,048 --> 01:12:44,097
Nor anybody else to talk to.

866
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,016
It might as well be Mrs. O'Toole from Cush.

867
01:12:49,012 --> 01:12:50,045
What do you want me to say?

868
01:12:52,013 --> 01:12:54,001
That would be Nancy and Annette.

869
01:12:55,016 --> 01:12:56,029
Off you go.

870
01:12:59,068 --> 01:13:01,010
Enjoy yourself.

871
01:13:18,021 --> 01:13:19,091
Eilis, this is Jim Farrell.

872
01:13:21,006 --> 01:13:22,079
It's a great pleasure to meet you.

873
01:13:26,076 --> 01:13:28,074
We could try the Connaught Hotel bar.

874
01:13:28,077 --> 01:13:31,013
There may be a few of the fellas from the rugby club there.

875
01:13:31,015 --> 01:13:32,020
Okay.

876
01:13:33,093 --> 01:13:37,000
Do you have to be with other fellas from the rugby club all the time?

877
01:13:37,097 --> 01:13:43,006
No. But Nancy told us that we wouldn't be allowed to talk to you.

878
01:13:43,008 --> 01:13:44,086
Because you have too much to say to each other.

879
01:13:44,089 --> 01:13:46,064
So we're just looking for company.

880
01:13:47,058 --> 01:13:48,073
Oh, well.

881
01:13:48,076 --> 01:13:51,021
Do you not like the fellas from the rugby club, Eilis?

882
01:13:51,024 --> 01:13:52,076
I don't particularly, George.

883
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:54,039
When I first went to America,

884
01:13:54,042 --> 01:13:57,083
I missed everything about Enniscorthy, except one.

885
01:13:57,086 --> 01:13:59,057
We are not all the same.

886
01:13:59,059 --> 01:14:03,045
You all look the same. It's the blazer and the hair-oil.

887
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:18,088
Nancy, where is Annette? And why has he come?

888
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,071
He's very nice, so don't be too hard on him.

889
01:14:22,003 --> 01:14:25,000
Is this the same Jim Farrell that was engaged to Cathleen Cassidy?

890
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:26,029
What happened to her?

891
01:14:26,031 --> 01:14:28,090
是他提了分手 吉姆觉得她并不是真正爱他
He broke it off. He didn’t think she was serious about him.

892
01:14:28,092 --> 01:14:31,081
He was very upset for a while, but he's over her now.

893
01:14:32,084 --> 01:14:36,000
Nancy, I'm going back.

894
01:14:36,003 --> 01:14:38,067
But you can have a bit of fun while you're here, can't you?

895
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:41,023
Come on George.

896
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:45,091
How is your mother?

897
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,078
Well, she's sad. And she's got much older very quickly.

898
01:14:54,017 --> 01:14:55,051
It was a terrible thing.

899
01:14:55,093 --> 01:14:59,007
We all went to the funeral mass. My mother and my father and myself.

900
01:15:00,006 --> 01:15:01,037
I did not know that.

901
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:04,086
My mother played golf with her, you know. she is very fond of her.

902
01:15:05,058 --> 01:15:10,065
It was the saddest thing that happened in the town that I can remember.

903
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:17,005
- Thank you. - Come on you two.

904
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:26,006
- What about the skyscrapers? - But that is Manhattan.

905
01:15:26,008 --> 01:15:29,096
I live in Brooklyn and I work in Brooklyn. And if I go out, I go out in Brooklyn.

906
01:15:30,008 --> 01:15:32,036
All the skyscrapers are across the river.

907
01:15:32,049 --> 01:15:35,086
- You don't make it sound very glamorous. - It's not, really.

908
01:15:35,089 --> 01:15:37,012
连那个 唉你叫它什么来着
Not even… What do you call it?

909
01:15:37,015 --> 01:15:38,054
The department store where you work?

910
01:15:38,056 --> 01:15:41,020
Oh, Bartocci's? Well, it sells lovely things,

911
01:15:41,022 --> 01:15:43,012
but I can't afford many of them ...

912
01:15:43,014 --> 01:15:44,039
and I don't like the works.

913
01:15:44,041 --> 01:15:45,075
What would you like to do?

914
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,033
I want to do what Rose did.

915
01:15:49,036 --> 01:15:51,067
I want to work in an office and deal with numbers.

916
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:53,038
You should call in at Davis's.

917
01:15:53,051 --> 01:15:55,093
They haven't managed to replace Rose, you know.

918
01:15:55,096 --> 01:15:58,014
I'll be going back to New York straight after the wedding.

919
01:15:58,017 --> 01:16:00,087
But you might want to earn a little money in the meantime.

920
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,028
I'm sure they'd be glad to have you.

921
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:04,091
Oh, you just want her to stay.

922
01:16:07,054 --> 01:16:09,011
I am only thinking of Eilis.

923
01:16:09,013 --> 01:16:11,078
Did you hear that Eilis? He's only thinking of you.

924
01:16:20,012 --> 01:16:21,029
That's it, that's it...

925
01:16:28,098 --> 01:16:30,009
- Good night. - Good night.

926
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:31,030
- See you. - See you.

927
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:32,050
Bye.

928
01:16:50,024 --> 01:16:54,016
- How's your evening? - It's very nice, thank you.

929
01:16:54,039 --> 01:16:56,081
Was that Jim Farrell I saw on the car with them?

930
01:16:58,010 --> 01:16:59,016
It was.

931
01:16:59,018 --> 01:17:01,047
His parents are moving, you know. They're retiring to the country.

932
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:03,040
He'll be in that big house on his own.

933
01:17:03,042 --> 01:17:04,094
Is that right?

934
01:17:06,069 --> 01:17:08,056
It's a catch for "someone".

935
01:17:10,085 --> 01:17:12,042
Goodnight Mommy.

936
01:17:24,038 --> 01:17:26,038
- Hello Eilis. - Hello Ms. Brennan..

937
01:17:26,057 --> 01:17:28,032
I like her style.

938
01:17:35,095 --> 01:17:38,010
- Thank Goodness you're back! - What's the matter?

939
01:17:38,012 --> 01:17:39,077
A lad from Davis's came round.

940
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,012
They have a problem in their accounts department

941
01:17:41,015 --> 01:17:43,013
- And they need you up there straight away. - Is that all?

942
01:17:43,015 --> 01:17:45,061
- I'll just put the shopping away. - No, no, leave it.

943
01:17:45,064 --> 01:17:47,023
那小伙子说的是 马上
“Straight away”, the young fella said.

944
01:17:47,025 --> 01:17:50,006
It doesn't matter what he said, Mother. I'm not an employee.

945
01:17:50,008 --> 01:17:51,025
I'd be doing them a favour.

946
01:17:51,028 --> 01:17:53,028
Please let me do the shopping.

947
01:18:02,017 --> 01:18:04,040
The problem is that it's our busy season,

948
01:18:04,042 --> 01:18:07,070
so all the middle workers and drivers did overtime last week.

949
01:18:07,073 --> 01:18:10,066
Well, they filled out the overtime slips

950
01:18:10,076 --> 01:18:12,050
but there's been nobody to work it all out,

951
01:18:12,057 --> 01:18:13,093
to add to the wage slips.

952
01:18:13,096 --> 01:18:15,078
And some of the men have started to complain.

953
01:18:15,082 --> 01:18:17,044
And I can't blame them.

954
01:18:17,046 --> 01:18:20,012
As you can see, it's all a terrible mess.

955
01:18:23,033 --> 01:18:26,061
Well. If you leave me for a couple of hours, I can work out a system

956
01:18:26,064 --> 01:18:29,020
so that whoever comes in after me won't have any trouble.

957
01:18:39,054 --> 01:18:40,096
Hello, Eilis.

958
01:18:40,098 --> 01:18:43,074
Maria has been telling me you have done the most marvellous job here.

959
01:18:43,077 --> 01:18:45,002
Thank you.

960
01:18:45,004 --> 01:18:46,025
We should have known you would, of course.

961
01:18:46,027 --> 01:18:48,005
You're Rose's sister, after all.

962
01:18:48,007 --> 01:18:50,027
I'm told you have a certificate in book-keeping?

963
01:18:50,028 --> 01:18:51,082
Is it in American book-keeping?

964
01:18:51,082 --> 01:18:53,046
I got the certificate in America,

965
01:18:53,048 --> 01:18:55,018
but the two systems are very similar.

966
01:18:55,090 --> 01:19:00,023
Well, we'll certainly need someone to deal with wages and so on during the busy season.

967
01:19:00,033 --> 01:19:03,036
so I'd like you to continue on a part-time basis.

968
01:19:03,036 --> 01:19:05,056
Let's see how that goes and then we'll speak again.

969
01:19:05,079 --> 01:19:08,002
I'll be going back to the United States soon.

970
01:19:08,002 --> 01:19:10,038
As I said. Lets you and I speak again before we make

971
01:19:10,038 --> 01:19:12,069
any firm decisions one way or the other.

972
01:19:14,095 --> 01:19:17,073
Yes, Mr. Brown. Of course. Thank you.

973
01:19:18,035 --> 01:19:20,093
Now, if you go and see Maria, she'll have your money for today.

974
01:20:24,007 --> 01:20:26,078
- I'd forgotten. - What?

975
01:20:28,006 --> 01:20:29,039
眼前的景色
This…

976
01:20:31,056 --> 01:20:33,019
You have beaches in Brooklyn?

977
01:20:34,017 --> 01:20:36,074
Yes, but they are just very crowded.

978
01:20:37,027 --> 01:20:40,019
There will probably be quite a few walkers along here later.

979
01:20:41,057 --> 01:20:44,078
Yes. It's still not the same.

980
01:20:46,081 --> 01:20:48,000
I'm sure it's not.

981
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:52,060
We don't really know anything of the rest of the world.

982
01:20:54,024 --> 01:20:56,050
We must seem very backward to you now.

983
01:20:56,082 --> 01:21:01,066
Of course not. You seem calm, and civilised. And charming.

984
01:21:08,022 --> 01:21:09,045
Come on!

985
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,063
我母亲想让你知道 她们的高尔夫俱乐部
My mother wanted you to know that the golf club…

986
01:21:19,069 --> 01:21:21,086
is inaugurating a prize in Rose's name.

987
01:21:24,085 --> 01:21:28,056
A special trophy for the best score by a lady newcomer at the Club.

988
01:21:30,021 --> 01:21:32,089
She was always very nice to the newcomers, my mother says.

989
01:21:36,022 --> 01:21:37,047
I hope you're pleased.

990
01:21:41,003 --> 01:21:44,033
Yes, of course.

991
01:21:46,088 --> 01:21:52,048
So, every year, someone will win the Rose Lacey Trophy?

992
01:21:53,054 --> 01:21:56,088
Every year. As long as there's a golf club.

993
01:22:02,005 --> 01:22:07,050
And I think she'd like you to come along and present it to the first winner.

994
01:22:11,084 --> 01:22:14,027
Yeah and my mother would like to meet you too, by the way.

995
01:22:16,049 --> 01:22:18,071
I'm supposed to arrange a time when you can come around for tea.

996
01:22:20,089 --> 01:22:22,085
Thank you, I'd like that.

997
01:22:28,057 --> 01:22:30,084
I wish it had been like this before I went.

998
01:22:31,096 --> 01:22:35,072
- Before Rose died. - Like what?

999
01:22:37,034 --> 01:22:41,033
之前我什么都没有 而现在 我有了一份工作 还...
There was nothing here for me here before. And now I have a job, and…

1000
01:22:42,051 --> 01:22:43,051
Here?

1001
01:22:58,075 --> 01:23:02,007
-这是美国人的方法吗    -是的 不错呢 是吧
- Is that an American trick? - Yes. It’s a good one, isn’t it?

1002
01:23:04,027 --> 01:23:07,017
It's depressing, though, that we don't think of things like that, isn't it?

1003
01:23:07,068 --> 01:23:10,017
I mean how long have they known about it?

1004
01:23:10,049 --> 01:23:12,025
A hundred years, probably.

1005
01:23:12,027 --> 01:23:15,020
I don't think they had bathing suits like that a hundred years ago.

1006
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:18,070
And we still don't have them now.

1007
01:23:21,098 --> 01:23:23,032
Well, come on.

1008
01:23:31,051 --> 01:23:33,063
You want to go see the Dodgers on Saturday?

1009
01:23:33,066 --> 01:23:34,075
Sure.

1010
01:23:34,078 --> 01:23:36,085
Okay, will you do something for me?

1011
01:23:37,018 --> 01:23:38,026
What?

1012
01:23:38,029 --> 01:23:42,022
If you laugh, or you say anything about this to anybody in the family,

1013
01:23:42,025 --> 01:23:44,039
you don't get to see the Dodgers on Saturday.

1014
01:23:44,041 --> 01:23:46,011
Or any other day of the season.

1015
01:23:46,013 --> 01:23:47,028
Also, you get a beating.

1016
01:23:47,031 --> 01:23:49,077
Maybe it's just better if I don't get involved.

1017
01:23:49,079 --> 01:23:52,021
I really need your help Frankie.

1018
01:23:52,024 --> 01:23:54,020
You know you're the best writer and reader in the family?

1019
01:23:55,001 --> 01:23:59,058
I'm trying to write to Eilis, and I want it to be, I don't know ...

1020
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:02,032
You wrote before already. About five times.

1021
01:24:02,035 --> 01:24:05,009
Yeah, but they are no good Frankie and ...

1022
01:24:07,067 --> 01:24:09,077
And she's only written back once.

1023
01:24:10,019 --> 01:24:13,099
She's never read my writing before. I'm worried I'm putting her off me.

1024
01:24:14,096 --> 01:24:19,011
Listen, I'm eight years old, I don't know anything about kissing.

1025
01:24:19,014 --> 01:24:21,030
You don't need to know anything about kissing.

1026
01:24:21,042 --> 01:24:25,002
You need to know about spelling and...and...

1027
01:24:25,004 --> 01:24:28,046
- Grammar? - Yeah, Will you look?

1028
01:24:36,068 --> 01:24:41,040
Dear Eilis, I hope that you're doing well in Ireland.

1029
01:24:41,043 --> 01:24:44,026
I hope that your mother is feeling less sad.

1030
01:24:45,078 --> 01:24:50,073
It will not be long before your friend gets married and you can come home.

1031
01:24:53,071 --> 01:24:57,019
This week it is like the whole world's basements are flooding.

1032
01:24:57,021 --> 01:25:03,051
I fixed three. I've been working hard. I've been saving money.

1033
01:25:04,022 --> 01:25:06,052
Everybody asks me about you all the time.

1034
01:25:06,094 --> 01:25:11,049
You missed out the "e" I think. It is "everybody."

1035
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,094
Anyway, I think that is all my news.

1036
01:25:15,097 --> 01:25:19,039
Mom and dad and all my brothers they all say hello.

1037
01:25:20,046 --> 01:25:23,048
I think about you most minutes of most days.

1038
01:25:25,005 --> 01:25:27,071
Even when I go see the Dodgers.

1039
01:25:27,071 --> 01:25:29,086
I do not concentrate on the game.

1040
01:25:31,033 --> 01:25:33,087
With love, your Tony.

1041
01:26:32,032 --> 01:26:33,070
No hair oil.

1042
01:26:34,048 --> 01:26:36,072
And that's not a blazer, it's a sports jacket.

1043
01:26:36,075 --> 01:26:38,078
Have you come out in disguise, Jim Farrell?

1044
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,096
Are you trying to trick me?

1045
01:26:42,006 --> 01:26:45,093
I knew what you meant, when you said we're all the same.

1046
01:26:47,003 --> 01:26:50,008
It made me think that my life must seem very east to you.

1047
01:26:50,011 --> 01:26:53,031
I run my father's bar, going to live in my parents' house.

1048
01:26:54,054 --> 01:26:56,016
I know what that must look like from the outside

1049
01:26:56,020 --> 01:27:00,017
But it doesn't feel like that.

1050
01:27:01,093 --> 01:27:03,046
What does it feel like?

1051
01:27:07,052 --> 01:27:08,092
I've never been anywhere.

1052
01:27:08,095 --> 01:27:10,096
I have never even been to England.

1053
01:27:10,098 --> 01:27:15,092
But I'd like to see London, and Paris and Rome. New York.

1054
01:27:16,058 --> 01:27:20,044
It frightens me, the idea of dying without ever leaving Ireland.

1055
01:27:20,047 --> 01:27:22,012
And there are other things too ...

1056
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:28,031
I'm so sorry. I wanted to ask you a thousand things and all I've done is talked.

1057
01:27:28,053 --> 01:27:29,062
I am glad.

1058
01:27:30,030 --> 01:27:32,043
- Really? - Yes.

1059
01:27:35,029 --> 01:27:37,078
Will you finsh that wretched pipe and sit with us?

1060
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:39,068
I can hear perfectly well from where I am.

1061
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:41,067
We are not here to provide you with entertainment.

1062
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:44,015
Oh, don't you worry. I found that out many years ago.

1063
01:27:44,058 --> 01:27:48,046
Just ignore him, Eilis. It's as well Jim takes after me, but him.

1064
01:27:48,049 --> 01:27:49,054
Speak up!

1065
01:27:49,086 --> 01:27:52,008
Are you looking forward to your move?

1066
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:54,056
Ah, I will miss Enniscorthy. But it's lovely and quiet in Glenbrien.

1067
01:27:54,088 --> 01:27:57,046
My mother's worried about leaving me here on me own.

1068
01:27:57,049 --> 01:27:59,028
She thinks I'll destroy the place.

1069
01:27:59,031 --> 01:28:00,093
I'm hoping you won't be on your own forever.

1070
01:28:01,005 --> 01:28:02,037
I'm sure he won't.

1071
01:28:03,058 --> 01:28:04,088
I mean...

1072
01:28:08,002 --> 01:28:10,064
- God, aren't we blessed with this weather. - It's lovely.

1073
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:30,086
Dear Tony, thank you for your letters.

1074
01:28:32,003 --> 01:28:33,055
I want you to know that...

1075
01:28:37,056 --> 01:28:39,007
I don't know what I want you to know.

1076
01:28:53,002 --> 01:28:54,067
I don't want to be sitting right at the back.

1077
01:28:54,069 --> 01:28:57,009
I'll make sure you get the best seats in the house.

1078
01:28:57,032 --> 01:29:00,031
Oh, it wouldn't feel right sitting up there with Nancy and George.

1079
01:29:01,007 --> 01:29:03,071
We'll find the second best seats in the house then.

1080
01:29:06,028 --> 01:29:09,060
Would you like me to run ahead and save you a couple of places, Mrs. Lacey?

1081
01:29:09,062 --> 01:29:11,075
Would you mind Jim? That would be grand.

1082
01:29:15,075 --> 01:29:18,027
- Such a gentleman, isn't he? - He is.

1083
01:29:19,059 --> 01:29:21,072
He came along at just the right time for us.

1084
01:29:24,042 --> 01:29:29,091
I invite you now Nancy, to declare before God and his church ...

1085
01:29:29,094 --> 01:29:33,054
your consent to become George's wife.

1086
01:29:35,013 --> 01:29:40,003
I promise to be true to you in good times and in bad,

1087
01:29:40,006 --> 01:29:44,007
in sickness and in health. I will love you

1088
01:29:44,016 --> 01:29:47,089
and honour you all the days of my life.

1089
01:29:48,071 --> 01:29:50,015
The rings.

1090
01:29:55,095 --> 01:30:01,014
Lord, bless these rings, grant that those who wear them

1091
01:30:01,017 --> 01:30:04,046
may always be faithful to each other.

1092
01:30:04,048 --> 01:30:09,066
May they do your will and live in peace with you, and mutual love.

1093
01:30:09,098 --> 01:30:13,075
We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.

1094
01:30:14,037 --> 01:30:15,071
Amen.

1095
01:30:24,065 --> 01:30:29,080
Your mother tells me things are working out for you very well in Enniscorthy, Eilis.

1096
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,051
It was a lovely service.

1097
01:30:32,053 --> 01:30:37,057
And Mr and Mrs Farrell are moving out to Glenbrien, so Jim will...

1098
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:39,041
Yes, I know.

1099
01:30:39,043 --> 01:30:42,009
Jim and I promised my mother we'd take her back to the car.

1100
01:30:42,011 --> 01:30:47,007
哦 听到了吗 吉姆和我 吉姆和我
Oh, do you hear that? “Jim and I! Jim and I!”.

1101
01:30:47,009 --> 01:30:48,080
It won't be long now, by the sound of it,

1102
01:30:48,083 --> 01:30:51,086
and your mother will have a wonderful day out.

1103
01:30:52,068 --> 01:30:55,049
Will you excuse me?

1104
01:31:04,058 --> 01:31:05,085
Can we talk?

1105
01:31:07,077 --> 01:31:12,028
- What about? - The future.

1106
01:31:13,068 --> 01:31:17,018
I can't let you just go back to America without saying anything.

1107
01:31:18,097 --> 01:31:21,026
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

1108
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:27,014
So, I don't want you to go.

1109
01:31:28,039 --> 01:31:31,041
I want you to stay here, with me.

1110
01:31:34,027 --> 01:31:36,099
And I know that means asking you another question,

1111
01:31:39,013 --> 01:31:40,086
But I don't want to bombard you.

1112
01:31:42,091 --> 01:31:44,099
So I'll save that one for later.

1113
01:31:50,069 --> 01:31:52,002
Thank you.

1114
01:31:55,076 --> 01:31:59,097
I'm grateful. And I'm flattered.

1115
01:32:02,071 --> 01:32:04,059
- That's all? - No.

1116
01:32:06,012 --> 01:32:08,000
No, of course not.

1117
01:32:13,086 --> 01:32:15,006
It is just...

1118
01:32:17,092 --> 01:32:20,039
I'd imagined a different life for myself.

1119
01:32:21,072 --> 01:32:22,089
I understand.

1120
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,038
But your life here could be just as good.

1121
01:32:28,017 --> 01:32:29,096
Better,even, maybe.

1122
01:33:11,070 --> 01:33:12,096
Mary!

1123
01:33:13,029 --> 01:33:15,012
I was just coming to fetch you.

1124
01:33:15,015 --> 01:33:18,039
To fetch me? I haven't worked for Miss Kelly for a long time, Mary.

1125
01:33:18,041 --> 01:33:21,060
Oh, Please come Eilis. She told me not to come back without you.

1126
01:33:21,063 --> 01:33:23,012
You know what she's like.

1127
01:33:34,046 --> 01:33:38,021
You look after things for five minutes while I'm upstairs with Eilis, please, Mary.

1128
01:33:38,024 --> 01:33:39,086
There are no customers in there at the moment,

1129
01:33:39,088 --> 01:33:42,046
so I don't think you can make too much of a mess of things.

1130
01:34:04,025 --> 01:34:06,091
So. How have you been getting on?

1131
01:34:08,008 --> 01:34:09,094
Very well, thanks, Miss Kelly.

1132
01:34:09,096 --> 01:34:12,033
I heard that you're working over at Davis's?

1133
01:34:12,037 --> 01:34:14,033
In the accounts department?

1134
01:34:14,045 --> 01:34:16,006
That's right.

1135
01:34:16,009 --> 01:34:19,042
And there's lots of talk about you and young Jim Farrell.

1136
01:34:19,045 --> 01:34:23,015
Ah, well. You know what people are like. They love to talk.

1137
01:34:23,018 --> 01:34:28,080
Yes. Do you remember Mrs. Brady?

1138
01:34:30,058 --> 01:34:34,016
She usually comes into the shop on Sunday morning for her rashers.

1139
01:34:36,029 --> 01:34:40,097
No? Well, you have a very busy life now.

1140
01:34:41,019 --> 01:34:42,086
What with one thing and another.

1141
01:34:44,019 --> 01:34:49,050
Anyway, Mrs Brady has a niece living in Brooklyn.

1142
01:34:52,079 --> 01:34:55,041
The world is a small place, isn't it?

1143
01:34:56,058 --> 01:34:59,050
She had a letter from her a couple of weeks back.

1144
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:03,017
And what did it say?

1145
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:08,055
Oh, only that she'd been to a wedding at the city hall,

1146
01:35:09,024 --> 01:35:15,027
and her husband bumped into a girl from Enniscorthy who was getting married there.

1147
01:35:18,065 --> 01:35:20,066
I'm not sure what you're telling me, Miss Kelly.

1148
01:35:20,066 --> 01:35:22,022
He didn't bump into me.

1149
01:35:22,025 --> 01:35:25,079
Oh, you can't fool me, Miss Lacey.

1150
01:35:26,093 --> 01:35:31,029
Although I'm not sure that that's your name any longer, is it?

1151
01:35:32,004 --> 01:35:36,094
He couldn't remember. Something Italian, he thought.

1152
01:35:44,012 --> 01:35:45,061
I'd forgotten.

1153
01:35:45,064 --> 01:35:48,069
You'd forgotten! What a thing for...

1154
01:35:48,069 --> 01:35:50,090
I'd forgotten what this town is like.

1155
01:35:55,084 --> 01:35:57,095
What were you planning to do, Miss Kelly?

1156
01:35:59,068 --> 01:36:01,023
Keep me away from Jim?

1157
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:05,037
Stop me from going back to America?

1158
01:36:07,092 --> 01:36:09,082
Perhaps you didn't even know.

1159
01:36:17,028 --> 01:36:21,002
My name is Eilis Fiorello.

1160
01:36:54,091 --> 01:36:58,006
- Thank you. - How I can help you?

1161
01:36:58,007 --> 01:37:02,075
Hello, I'd like to make a reservation for the next available sailing from Cobh to New York.

1162
01:37:03,037 --> 01:37:06,042
I think people spend even more money after a wedding.

1163
01:37:06,044 --> 01:37:08,093
Nancy's mother must have been in every shop in the town.

1164
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:10,097
She was buying firelighters in Broom's.

1165
01:37:10,099 --> 01:37:12,060
Firelighters! In August!

1166
01:37:12,062 --> 01:37:14,050
But she'd seen Mrs. Stapleton in there,

1167
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:17,065
and she hadn't had a chance to go through the whole day in detail with her, so...

1168
01:37:19,072 --> 01:37:21,026
Eilis, what's the matter?

1169
01:37:21,029 --> 01:37:23,017
Has something happened with Jim?

1170
01:37:24,045 --> 01:37:26,009
Mommy, I'm sorry.

1171
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,017
I'm so sorry. I'm married.

1172
01:37:33,034 --> 01:37:37,054
I got married in Brooklyn before I came home. I should have told you.

1173
01:37:38,033 --> 01:37:40,059
I should have told you as soon as I got back.

1174
01:37:45,086 --> 01:37:51,046
I want to be with him. I want to be with my husband.

1175
01:37:54,013 --> 01:37:55,066
Of course.

1176
01:37:58,064 --> 01:38:00,002
Is he nice?

1177
01:38:02,003 --> 01:38:03,022
Yes.

1178
01:38:03,024 --> 01:38:05,048
He'd have to be nice, if you married him.

1179
01:38:08,053 --> 01:38:10,011
So you are going back?

1180
01:38:11,074 --> 01:38:14,097
Yes. Tomorrow.

1181
01:38:18,059 --> 01:38:20,022
Are you on the early train?

1182
01:38:25,092 --> 01:38:27,055
I'm going to bed.

1183
01:38:27,078 --> 01:38:31,054
Mummy...It's not even eight o'clock. You don't have to..

1184
01:38:31,054 --> 01:38:33,000
I'm very tired.

1185
01:38:34,068 --> 01:38:40,067
And I'd like to say goodbye now, and only once.

1186
01:39:14,076 --> 01:39:16,073
Perhaps you'll write and tell me about him.

1187
01:39:17,052 --> 01:39:18,057
I will.

1188
01:39:19,087 --> 01:39:21,043
Goodnight Eilis.

1189
01:41:37,077 --> 01:41:39,074
So are you away to live in America?

1190
01:41:41,028 --> 01:41:44,010
- No. - Just visiting?

1191
01:41:45,022 --> 01:41:46,084
No. I live there already.

1192
01:41:47,065 --> 01:41:50,010
Really? What's it like?

1193
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:53,011
It's a big place.

1194
01:41:55,033 --> 01:41:59,054
I'm gonna live in Brooklyn, New York. Do you know it?

1195
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:02,094
Yes.

1196
01:42:04,019 --> 01:42:06,099
People say that there's so many Irish people there.

1197
01:42:07,096 --> 01:42:09,031
It's like home.

1198
01:42:12,079 --> 01:42:14,030
Is that right?

1199
01:42:19,002 --> 01:42:22,066
Yes, it's just like home.

1200
01:42:35,062 --> 01:42:37,000
You're not to eat.

1201
01:42:38,018 --> 01:42:40,003
But I might be there years.

1202
01:42:40,036 --> 01:42:42,024
No, you can eat when you get there.

1203
01:42:42,024 --> 01:42:43,080
Don't eat on the boat.

1204
01:42:43,082 --> 01:42:46,000
It'll stop you getting so sick. Do you promise me?

1205
01:42:46,097 --> 01:42:47,071
I promise.

1206
01:42:47,073 --> 01:42:50,079
And in a moment, I want you to go straight down to your cabin

1207
01:42:50,082 --> 01:42:52,050
and lock the bathroom door on your side.

1208
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:55,091
When next door starts hammering, you can negotiate.

1209
01:42:57,064 --> 01:43:00,054
When you get to Immigration, keep your eyes wide open,

1210
01:43:00,054 --> 01:43:02,037
Look as if you know where you're going.

1211
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:04,069
You have to think like an American.

1212
01:43:04,071 --> 01:43:06,005
Could you please step forward?

1213
01:43:07,025 --> 01:43:10,044
You'll feel so homesick that you'll want to die,

1214
01:43:10,066 --> 01:43:13,083
and there's nothing you can do about it apart from endure it.

1215
01:43:15,064 --> 01:43:18,061
But you will, and it won't kill you.

1216
01:43:32,089 --> 01:43:36,013
And one day the sun will come out

1217
01:43:36,035 --> 01:43:40,011
and you might not even note it straight away, it would be that faint.

1218
01:43:40,064 --> 01:43:44,033
And then you will catch yourself thinking about something or

1219
01:43:44,035 --> 01:43:47,044
or someone who has no connection with the past,

1220
01:43:49,028 --> 01:43:51,024
Someone who's only yours.

1221
01:43:52,076 --> 01:43:54,057
And you'll realise

1222
01:43:57,005 --> 01:43:59,011
that this is where your life is.
