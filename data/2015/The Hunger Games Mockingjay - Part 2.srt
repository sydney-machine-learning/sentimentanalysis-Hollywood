1
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,450
Okay.

2
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,380
Okay, I know, I know. I'm sorry.

3
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,209
I know it's a little tender.

4
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,447
Hmm.

5
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,771
Okay, let's try your voice now.

6
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,971
My name is Katniss Everdeen.
I'm from District 12.

7
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,060
- "My...
- Okay, take your time.

8
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,766
Still got a lot of swelling
in your vocal chords.

9
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,247
"My...

10
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,326
name is...

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,645
Katniss Everdeen."

12
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,728
I want...

13
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,007
I want to talk to him.

14
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,325
He needs time.

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,246
But, um, we're trying somethin' new today.

16
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,500
He's been calmer with the doctors,

17
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,660
but they're strangers to him.

18
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,808
So we're gonna test his response
on someone he remembers from home.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,650
Someone he trusts.

20
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,321
Send her in.

21
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,380
Hey.

22
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,100
Prim.

23
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,820
How you feelin'?

24
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,060
- She's too close.
- Mmm, it's okay.

25
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,420
- How'd you get here?
- We live in District 13 now.

26
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,180
It's a real place. Stories are true.

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,169
You were rescued.

28
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,924
My family hasn't come to see me.

29
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,340
There was an attack on 12.

30
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,680
Yes.

31
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,207
My family?

32
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,922
The bakery didn't survive.

33
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,326
It's Katniss.

34
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,980
- It's because of Katniss.
- Wasn't because of her.

35
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,500
- She tell you to say that?
- She didn't tell me anything.

36
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,900
She's a liar, Prim. It's a trick.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,288
Peeta, what you're saying isn't real.

38
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,500
She sent you here to talk to me.

39
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,940
- She knows you're here now.
- It's okay.

40
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,980
She knows... You can't trust her!

41
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,540
She's a monster!

42
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,166
She's a mutt that The Capitol
created to destroy us!

43
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,220
- Get her outta there.
- Do you understand me?

44
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,120
You have to kill her, Prim!
You have to kill her!

45
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,445
- Katniss?
- She's a mutt!

46
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,300
This is just a conditioned response.

47
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,140
- Kill her!
- It's not him.

48
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,700
She's a monster! She's a mutt!

49
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,689
- No, it's not him.
- She's a mutt!

50
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,620
There's not enough
manpower coming in from 4.

51
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,220
I don't think that's a problem.

52
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,300
Please, come in.

53
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,420
With any kind of manpower, if we...

54
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,060
Will you excuse us for just a moment?

55
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,650
Of course.

56
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,321
Have a seat.

57
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,044
I'm glad you're feeling better.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,340
Snow has to pay for what he's done.

59
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,420
I wanna help the rebels in any way I can.

60
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,940
It's hard to see Peeta this way.

61
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,405
That's not Peeta.

62
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,820
Send me to The Capitol. I'll do anything.

63
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,160
I can't...

64
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,569
I can't send you there.

65
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,460
We can't get into The Capitol
until we control District 2.

66
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,686
Then send me to 2.

67
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,860
You want me to fire up our troops?

68
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,088
Call out to the loyalists?
You've seen what I can do.

69
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,010
Yes, I have.

70
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,420
I saw Peeta... before we left.

71
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,124
And what did you think?

72
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,049
Something selfish.

73
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,641
That you don't have to be
jealous of him anymore.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,365
No.

75
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,251
I don't stand a chance
if he doesn't get better.

76
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,486
You'll never let him go.

77
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,604
What's goin' on in your head?

78
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,770
I don't know.

79
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,201
That's like kissing someone who's drunk.

80
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,406
Doesn't count.

81
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,580
30 minutes until touchdown.

82
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,886
Prepare for landing.

83
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,323
Wrap it up. Cut the chatter. Let's go.

84
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,180
This is another version
of booby-trapping a resource.

85
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,820
- Right, I see.
- This one's designed to blind.

86
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,100
Smoke clings to the eyes.

87
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,500
That's an application
of the hummingbird trap.

88
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,500
You scare people
so they flee in this direction

89
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,660
into what they think is a safe haven.

90
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,220
Two-tiered explosion.

91
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,940
You allow people enough time
to rush in, help the wounded, then...

92
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,646
- A second bomb.
- Right.

93
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,820
Second one goes off here.

94
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,284
I guess there are no rules anymore about
what a person can do to another person.

95
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,369
I don't think Snow used any
rulebook when he hijacked Peeta.

96
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,780
Welcome to District 2. I'm Corporal Homes.

97
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,484
You follow me, please.

98
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,700
Don't worry.

99
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,167
It's just how the loyalists
say "Good morning."

100
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,002
President Coin, we're indebted to you
for the reinforcements and the Mockingjay.

101
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,580
But I'm not sure that anyone outside
of 2 knows what we've been up against.

102
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,980
This is The Nut.

103
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,700
The Capitol's headquarters
for all offensive operations.

104
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,620
It's manned by both military
and civilian personnel from District 2.

105
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,340
As you can see,

106
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,100
the fortress lies so far beneath
the bedrock, it's untouchable.

107
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,646
Yesterday, we attempted
to take the northeastern gate.

108
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,369
The enemy countered from higher up
and we were forced to pull back.

109
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,980
We took heavy losses.

110
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,765
Could we create a decoy?
Send troops towards one gate,

111
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,980
launch a staggered attack on another.

112
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,980
Whose troops do you propose
as a decoy, commander?

113
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,527
We have the Mockingjay.
Don't underestimate her.

114
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,660
We could use her to erode support.

115
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,300
She may be able to sway
some of the loyalists.

116
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,740
You've been underground
a long time, Madam Coin.

117
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,683
This isn't like the rest of Panem.

118
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,980
Support for The Capitol runs deep here.

119
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,560
Then there is no sacrifice too great.

120
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,660
We need to control the arsenal
inside that fortress.

121
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,660
Even with every district in this alliance,
we are outgunned.

122
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,891
I won't commit my people to a ground
assault just to pillage weapons.

123
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,843
Commander Paylor,
your people have suffered

124
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,140
more than just about anyone else
at the hands of The Capitol.

125
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,820
Which is why I won't
condone a mass suicide.

126
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,540
If we don't take District 2,
we won't get into The Capitol.

127
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,440
Would it be enough to disable
the fortress... instead of taking it?

128
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,680
What do you have in mind?

129
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,060
You think of it like a wolf den.

130
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,940
You're not gonna fight your way in,
so you've got two choices:

131
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,700
You trap the wolves inside,
or you flush 'em out.

132
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,100
If we can't attack straight on,

133
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,260
then couldn't we use our hovercraft to
strike around it? We'll use the mountains.

134
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,486
We'll hit weak spots in the peaks.

135
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,980
We could design the bomb targets
in sequence using seismic data.

136
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,491
Trigger avalanches.

137
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,100
Block all exits, cut off their supplies.

138
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,820
You make it impossible for them
to launch their hovercraft.

139
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,660
Bury them alive.

140
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,060
We'd forfeit any chance
to control the weapons.

141
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,660
Yes, but we'd face a weakened Capitol.

142
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,410
There's civilians in there.

143
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,448
They should be given
a chance to surrender.

144
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,900
Could use one of the supply
tunnels for the evacuees.

145
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,500
It's a luxury we weren't given
when they firebombed 12.

146
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,700
There's gotta be a better way.

147
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,940
I suggest we try the avalanche,
but leave the train tunnel alone.

148
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,940
Civilians can escape into the square,

149
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,820
where our armies will be
waiting for their surrender.

150
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,287
We should have every
available medic standing by.

151
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,140
And if they won't surrender?

152
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,020
Then we will need a compelling voice...

153
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,884
to persuade them.

154
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,540
Red flag, this is blue leader.

155
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,166
Form up on Charlie Tango,
1,500 meters out.

156
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,811
All bombers are outbound.

157
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,860
What's the difference, Katniss?

158
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,180
Crushing the enemy in a mine or blowin' them
outta the sky with one of Beetee's arrows.

159
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,420
It's the same thing.

160
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,761
We were under attack in District 8,

161
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,260
and that hovercraft
wasn't filled with civilians.

162
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,900
Doesn't matter.

163
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,490
Even if those civilians are just moppin'
floors, they're helping the enemy.

164
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,363
And if they have to die,
I can live with that.

165
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,380
No one who supports
The Capitol is innocent.

166
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,700
With that kinda thinking,
you can kill whoever you want.

167
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,765
You can send kids off to The Hunger Games
to keep the districts in line.

168
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,168
It's war, Katniss.

169
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,289
Sometimes killing isn't personal.

170
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,660
Figured if anyone knew that, it was you.

171
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,889
I, of all people, know
that it's always personal.

172
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,122
Don't worry, Katniss,
there'll be survivors.

173
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,820
Let's focus on what it is you gotta say.

174
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,780
Now, Plutarch wrote a speech for you...

175
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,860
I'm not saying that.

176
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,531
Okay. Didn't think so. Let's, uh...

177
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,660
But just remember,
you're talking to everybody.

178
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,940
Not just the rebels, but The Capitol,
the survivors in 2.

179
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,260
We want them to lay down their arms.

180
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,127
So you might wanna experiment
with a little sensitivity, warmth.

181
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,523
Make it quick, you're exposed.

182
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,340
This is Katniss Everdeen,

183
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,091
speaking to all of the loyalists
from the heart of District 2.

184
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,580
Survivors! Inbound!

185
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,569
Ready! Ready! Guns up!

186
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,802
On the ready. Guns up!

187
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,370
We gotta get you back.

188
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,611
Here they come!

189
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,531
Weapons tight! Weapons tight!

190
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,088
Everybody, stand by!

191
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,820
On the ground!

192
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,940
Put your weapons down.

193
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,740
Get on the ground!

194
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,940
Put your weapons down now!

195
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,122
Weapons down!

196
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,241
You! Put it down!

197
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,020
Put it...

198
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,860
- Put your weapons down!
- Drop it!

199
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,850
Drop your weapon! You! Drop it.

200
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,380
Drop the gun!

201
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,860
Drop it!

202
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,340
- Hold your fire!
- Stop!

203
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,060
Stop!

204
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,220
- Hold your fire!
- Stop!

205
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,100
- Hold your fire!
- He needs help!

206
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,725
Hold your fire!

207
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,931
Drop it!

208
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,460
Give me one reason I shouldn't shoot you.

209
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,686
Drop the gun!

210
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,331
I can't.

211
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,969
I guess that's the problem, isn't it?

212
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,291
We blew up your mine.

213
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,722
You burned my district to the ground.

214
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,251
We each have every reason
to want to kill each other.

215
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,124
So if you wanna kill me, do it.

216
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,980
Make Snow happy.

217
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,050
I'm tired of killing his slaves for him.

218
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,282
I'm not his slave.

219
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,405
I am.

220
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,170
That's why I killed Cato.

221
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,971
And he killed Thresh.

222
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,530
And Thresh killed Clove.

223
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,900
It just goes around and around.

224
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,126
And who wins?

225
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,567
Always Snow.

226
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,127
I am done being a piece in his game.

227
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,444
District 12, District 2. We have no fight.

228
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,967
Except the one The Capitol gave us.

229
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,643
Why are you fighting the rebels?

230
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,686
You're neighbors.

231
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,441
You're family.

232
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,964
These people are not your enemy.

233
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,088
We all have one enemy.

234
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,689
And that's Snow.

235
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,569
He corrupts everyone and everything.

236
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,682
He turns the best of us
against each other.

237
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,131
Stop killing for him.

238
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,167
Tonight, turn your weapons to The Capitol.

239
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,050
Turn your weapons to Snow.

240
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,530
Tonight, turn your weapons to The Capitol.

241
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,162
Turn your weapons to Snow.

242
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,326
Hold your fire.

243
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,650
A toast.

244
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,740
Antonius, with our best troops
crushed in the mountains

245
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,780
and the rebels marching on us as we speak,

246
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,450
what did we celebrate?

247
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,887
The death of the Mockingjay, sir.

248
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,761
If Peeta didn't kill her,
her own arrogance did.

249
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,460
Of course.

250
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,380
That's the same facile thinking

251
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,405
that led you to divert our best
Peacekeepers into District 2.

252
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,020
You have a habit of burying
people before they're dead.

253
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,260
If the Mockingjay were gone,

254
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,603
the rebels would already be
using her as a martyr.

255
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,846
No, Minister Antonius,

256
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,020
I'm afraid that is not
what we were toasting at all.

257
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,841
Sir, the rebels can be held off out...

258
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,729
The rebels will reach the outskirts
of The Capitol in a matter of days.

259
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,242
We'll evacuate the outer
blocks to let them in.

260
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,340
I want all anti-aircraft defenses ready,

261
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,920
so we're secure from the skies.

262
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,900
Lure them into the city,

263
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,100
and then our Gamemakers

264
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,124
will make them pay
for every inch with blood.

265
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,340
I want every camera watching.

266
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,001
We'll turn their advance into
a celebration of suffering.

267
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,684
Let each moment be captured
for all posterity.

268
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,889
So, what did we toast tonight,
Minister Antonius?

269
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,167
We toasted a glorious era...

270
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,005
coming to its bitter end.

271
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,047
Well, there she is. The Mockingjay.

272
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,048
Oh, that speech you gave. Oh, man, feel.

273
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,401
I mean, I still have goose bumps.

274
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,860
You don't mind, do you?

275
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,860
They cut off my supply of morphling.

276
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,380
There's this head doctor that
comes in and sees me every day,

277
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,500
trying to help me adjust to reality.

278
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,180
Like some guy from this rabbit's warren

279
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,362
actually knows anything about my reality.

280
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,921
At least 20 times in a session,
he tells me that I'm totally safe.

281
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,009
Safe from The Capitol.

282
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,090
Safe from Snow.

283
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,500
What about you, Mockingjay?
You feeling totally safe?

284
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,420
- Till I got shot.
- Oh, please.

285
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,580
The bullet didn't even touch you.

286
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,900
Cinna saw to that. Of course,
your costume would be bulletproof.

287
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,048
So what are your injuries?

288
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,540
Bruised ribs, bruised lung.

289
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,246
I'm surprised they haven't
found you a new lung.

290
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,047
I mean, I've got two.
Do you want one of mine?

291
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,900
I mean, it's everybody's job
to keep you alive.

292
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,820
- Is that why you hate me?
- Partly.

293
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,500
You're also a little hard to swallow.

294
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,820
The whole tacky romance drama
and the "defender of the hopeless" act.

295
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,740
Even though it's not an act.

296
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,922
Which makes it even more unbearable.

297
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,367
Feel free to take any of this personally.

298
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,244
You should have been the Mockingjay.

299
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,860
Nobody else would tell you what to say.

300
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,724
But nobody likes me.

301
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,300
- They're afraid of you.
- Maybe here,

302
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,340
but... in The Capitol,
you're the only thing

303
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,930
that they're scared of.

304
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,089
It's just stuff my family brought.

305
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,131
It's from Peeta.

306
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,841
Yeah.

307
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,921
They messed us up
pretty good, didn't they?

308
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,081
We showed him footage of your speech in 2.

309
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,460
He had real memories of you.

310
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,740
That still doesn't mean
I'm going in there.

311
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,500
He's strapped down. He can't hurt you.

312
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,340
No. This is different. Haymitch,
I really don't want to.

313
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,807
It doesn't matter what you want.
It's for Peeta.

314
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,923
What's the harm in trying?

315
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,000
I watched you die.

316
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,129
- You look terrible.
- You've looked better.

317
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,860
You're not even remotely nice
to say that to me now.

318
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,486
I was never the nice one. You were.

319
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,569
When I saw you die,
I remembered something.

320
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,520
About the bread.

321
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,007
I remember... you in the rain.

322
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,811
And I burned it on purpose.

323
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,170
To give it to you.

324
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,284
I remember my mother hitting me.

325
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,100
I was supposed to give it to the pig.

326
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,646
That was the first we'd eaten in days.

327
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,460
Why would I take
a beating like that for you?

328
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,531
Because you were kind and generous.

329
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,804
- And people said you loved me.
- Did people say you love me?

330
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,220
They said that's why Snow
tortured you. To hurt me.

331
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,641
Snow says that everything that
comes out of your mouth is a lie.

332
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,284
All I know is that I would have
saved myself a lot of suffering,

333
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,722
if I'd just given that bread to the pig.

334
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,162
I think the only thing left
to say is "thank you."

335
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,620
I need to be in The Capitol.

336
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,660
No, you have done your job.

337
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,220
You've been very successful
as the Mockingjay.

338
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,325
You've unified the districts.
And now we want you to rest.

339
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,329
And to heal.

340
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,660
The last the rebels saw me,
I was lying on the ground.

341
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,491
Katniss, we won't let this
momentum go to waste.

342
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,220
We'll shoot more propos right here in 13,

343
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,860
showing them that you're alive.

344
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,100
I should be with the troops.

345
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,220
It'll be like being on the front lines.

346
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,620
As far as the soldiers know,

347
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,660
you survived a bullet to the heart.

348
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,127
I think they'll understand
why you're not with them.

349
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,540
When we win this war,
we'll fly you in for the surrender.

350
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,005
We'll need you for the ceremony.

351
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,122
You're very valuable to us.

352
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,641
I'll do whatever you need me to do.

353
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,820
From this day forth,
in sickness and in health,

354
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,924
for richer or poorer.

355
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,042
I promise to love
and cherish you each day.

356
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,328
I, Finnick Odair,

357
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,204
take you, Annie Cresta,
as my wife from this day forth.

358
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,940
Together or apart,
we will always be united.

359
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:19,100
One life, one purpose, one destiny.

360
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,770
You may kiss the bride.

361
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,164
You saw Peeta, didn't you?

362
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,180
Did you tell him "Hi" for me?

363
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,260
We're old friends, you know.

364
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,220
We had adjoining cells in The Capitol.

365
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,926
We're very familiar
with each other's screams.

366
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,444
I'm going to kill Snow.

367
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,201
Nothing good is safe while he's alive.

368
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,487
And I can't make another speech about it.

369
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,525
No more cameras. No more propos.

370
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,248
No more Games.

371
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,890
He needs to see my eyes when I kill him.

372
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,211
Now you're talking.

373
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,100
Find a way to The Capitol

374
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,282
when everybody's looking the other way.

375
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,940
I hear the medics talking.

376
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,689
They're shipping supplies for the front line
from hangar two around midnight tonight.

377
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,740
Medicine, painkillers.

378
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,740
I was gonna go steal some for myself,

379
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,767
but I guess I could just
stay here and cover for you.

380
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,049
Anybody can kill anybody, Katniss.
Even a president.

381
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,491
You just have to be willing
to sacrifice yourself.

382
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,043
Go on.

383
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,483
Don't you want Snow to see you dance?

384
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,804
Hey, that's her.

385
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,565
That's Katniss Everdeen.

386
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,460
Hey. Thought you were in the hospital.

387
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,846
I was.

388
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,325
Come on.

389
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,846
What is she doing?

390
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,580
I don't know, it's so frustrating
when she goes rogue.

391
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,923
This isn't just adolescent,
it's insubordination.

392
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,500
Put her on the first hovercraft back.

393
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,887
Don't be ridiculous.
She can't come back now.

394
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,485
She's mythic.

395
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,445
At the front lines,
surviving a gunshot wound.

396
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,402
Couldn't have staged it better myself.

397
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,008
Hmm. I know.

398
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,882
She's going to stay where she is.

399
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,331
And whatever she's doing, we conceived it.

400
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,690
It was our plan all along.

401
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,084
Of course it was.

402
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,046
Mr. Heavensbee, you're the Gamemaker.

403
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,331
I want everyone to know, whatever game
she's playing, she's playing for us.

404
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,900
I'm Commander Paylor of District 8.

405
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,100
I'm a soldier, like all of you,
so here's what I know.

406
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,845
For the first time in our lifetimes,
we're standing together with 13 districts.

407
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,040
From what I see here,
we've already made history.

408
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,802
But history doesn't stop to celebrate.

409
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,580
And we're facing an enemy that will
not change and will never surrender.

410
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,460
President Snow has
pulled back Peacekeepers

411
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,020
to fortify the center of the city.

412
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,780
He's evacuating residents
from the outer blocks.

413
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,140
These civilians will be
confused and desperate.

414
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,766
You are under orders not to target them.

415
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,370
We're deploying medical brigades
to help anyone in need.

416
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,848
We'll show The Capitol people who we are.

417
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,980
To slow our advance, President Snow
is building a minefield of traps

418
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,860
and lethal devices called "pods."

419
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,260
The sadistic inventions of Gamemakers
meant to make sport of our deaths.

420
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,460
If our armies make it past
Peacekeepers and other defenses,

421
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,780
we'll converge in the center
of the city at Snow's mansion,

422
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,580
where we won't just unlock his gates,

423
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,762
but unshackle all of Panem.

424
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,260
If we die, let it be for
a cause and not a spectacle.

425
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,020
If we succeed, let it be for all of Panem,

426
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,849
and let it be forever.

427
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,007
Yes, you've already made history.

428
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,881
But the future, our future,
starts tomorrow at dawn,

429
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,446
when we march together into The Capitol.

430
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,726
Squad 451?

431
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,842
Looks like you got your meals covered.

432
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,443
- Tryin' to be prepared.
- Don't lie to me.

433
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,888
We've been hunting together all our lives.

434
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,762
I know when you're gonna
go off on your own.

435
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,220
You gonna leave me behind, too?

436
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,808
As your fellow soldier, I suggest
that you stay with your unit.

437
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,500
But I couldn't stop you
if you wanted to come.

438
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:30,128
Hawthorne, Everdeen,
come meet your new unit.

439
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,420
I'm Lieutenant Jackson,

440
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,522
and I wanna introduce you to your squad.

441
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,540
This is Second Lieutenant Mitchell,

442
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,580
best sharpshooter in Panem.

443
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,740
These are the Leeg sisters.
First Combat Division.

444
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,207
And this is Corporal Homes.

445
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,645
Finnick?

446
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,500
- Are you with us?
- Looks like it.

447
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,090
That was a short honeymoon.

448
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,580
Yeah, well,

449
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,460
I guess we're gonna have to
have one in The Capitol.

450
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,369
- After we take it.
- Gather 'round.

451
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,442
Squad 451, you're my unit.

452
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,128
Lieutenant Jackson is
my second-in-command.

453
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,700
Each one of you is elite
in some form of combat.

454
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,020
But we are a non-combat unit.

455
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,580
So we'll be following days
behind the front-line troops.

456
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,860
You're to be the onscreen
faces of the invasion.

457
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,140
"The Star Squad."

458
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,242
It's been decided that
you're most effective

459
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,300
- when seen by the masses.
- So we're not gonna fight?

460
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,164
You'll do whatever
you're ordered to do, soldier.

461
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,380
It's not your job to ask questions.

462
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,209
Yes, sir.

463
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,740
Our instructions are
to shoot propaganda footage

464
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,380
on the battle-scarred streets
of The Capitol.

465
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,847
You were handpicked
to intimidate their forces.

466
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,740
And inspire surrenders.

467
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,140
Even though we'll be working on abandoned
streets miles behind the front lines,

468
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,820
I guarantee you, wherever they put us,

469
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,049
it will not be safe. This is a war zone.

470
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,529
It is likely that we'll encounter
both active pods and Peacekeepers.

471
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,660
You're considered high-value
targets to The Capitol.

472
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,220
In the event of capture,
you'll be given a nightlock pill.

473
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,580
A poison that acts immediately.

474
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,860
Lieutenant Jackson, do the honors.

475
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,060
I've already briefed you on the pods.

476
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,766
I remind you, they are on every block.

477
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,889
Our unit has been given a Holo.

478
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,086
A database that contains
a detailed map of The Capitol

479
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,180
and a list of every known pod.

480
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,020
These pods can trigger anything from bombs

481
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,460
to traps to mutts.

482
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,540
We cannot move without this device.

483
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,860
There's no guarantee
that our database is complete.

484
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,780
There could be new pods
that we're not aware of.

485
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,300
Because we don't want
the Gamemakers to know

486
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,340
we have this intel,
it has a self-destruct on it.

487
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,780
You flip this switch,
say "nightlock" three times,

488
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,580
and it blows itself and anything
within a 10-foot radius.

489
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,620
Stay within our unit.

490
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,180
Even with the Holo,

491
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,204
it is likely that new pods have been set.

492
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,324
Whatever they contain,
they are meant to kill you.

493
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,940
Ladies and gentlemen,

494
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,884
welcome to the 76th Hunger Games.

495
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,500
I've never seen this place so empty.

496
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,090
Just keep your eyes open.

497
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,163
Got a pod. Let's take cover.

498
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,325
Shoot through those two buildings.

499
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,281
Pollux... right here.

500
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,681
Castor.

501
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,605
Good.

502
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,526
When you're ready, Katniss.

503
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,441
Hold it. Pollux, tighter.

504
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,200
Okay.

505
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,091
All clear.

506
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,369
I don't think we can
get across this minefield.

507
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,688
Not without that Holo.

508
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,500
We're not gonna get it
off him while he's awake.

509
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,967
Let's make sure we're on
the same watch tonight.

510
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,920
Is that Peacekeepers?

511
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,460
451 to base.

512
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,767
We've got a truck coming in
from the south. Over.

513
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,409
Copy that. Over.

514
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,167
Stand down, everyone. It's friendly.

515
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,700
My name is Peeta Mellark.

516
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,961
My home is District 12.

517
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,580
My name is Peeta Mellark.
My home is District 12.

518
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,540
- Okay, stop.
- My name is Peeta Mellark.

519
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,820
- Hold up. Everyone relax.
- My home is District 12.

520
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,251
What are we doin'?

521
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,530
Jackson, cuff him.

522
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,740
Soldier, this is just a precaution

523
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,842
till we can get everything
straightened out. Yeah?

524
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,928
My name's Peeta Mellark. From District 12.

525
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,540
They want us to add him to the propo.

526
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,642
Show that he's on our side now.

527
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,100
We'll move forward a few blocks tomorrow
and shoot the new footage.

528
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,620
He's not in control of himself.

529
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,540
I say we schedule an
around-the-clock watch on him.

530
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,380
The Leegs till 1700,
Homes and Mitchell till 1900.

531
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,084
Give me a watch.

532
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,260
And if it really came down to it,
you think you could shoot him?

533
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,169
I wouldn't be shooting Peeta.

534
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,569
I'd be killing a Capitol mutt.

535
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,100
I'm not sure that kind of a comment

536
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,043
recommends you for the job,
either, soldier.

537
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,286
Put her in the rotation.

538
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,260
He's gonna try to kill me.

539
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,700
Especially with all this going on.

540
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,325
It's gonna set him off.

541
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,930
We'll keep him contained.

542
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,524
Why would Coin do this?

543
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,961
Here's all I know.

544
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,780
It was Peeta that she wanted
rescued from the arena.

545
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,740
She never liked you.

546
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,446
She doesn't like anybody
or anything she can't control.

547
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,620
So she would put my life in danger?

548
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,484
She'd deny it, but...

549
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,540
What?

550
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,688
One way or another, this war
is gonna come to an end.

551
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,290
They promised a free election.

552
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,928
Maybe she's startin' to
see you as a threat.

553
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,460
Nobody would think I'd be a leader.

554
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,220
But you'd throw your support to someone.

555
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,924
Would it be her?

556
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,444
And if your immediate answer
isn't "yes," then you're dangerous.

557
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,260
She doesn't need you
as a rallying cry anymore.

558
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,180
These propos can be done without you.

559
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,370
There's only one thing you could do now
to add more fire to this rebellion.

560
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,900
Die.

561
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,446
That's not gonna happen
under my watch, Katniss.

562
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,170
I'm plannin' for you to have a long life.

563
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,049
Why? You don't owe me anything.

564
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,330
Because you've earned it.

565
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,124
We've been here before, you know.

566
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,965
What?

567
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,121
That look.

568
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,886
I've seen that look.

569
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,690
You're trying to decide
whether or not you should kill me.

570
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,924
I never wanted to kill you.

571
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,980
And that's not what I'm doing.

572
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:00,260
I saw it with my own eyes.
In the first Games.

573
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,364
In the first Games, I thought you were
trying to help the Careers kill me.

574
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:10,044
After that,
I always saw you... as an ally.

575
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,850
Friend, lover...

576
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,966
Victor...

577
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,890
fiancé,

578
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,740
enemy, target, mutt.

579
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,700
And now ally?

580
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,289
Yeah, I'll add that to the list of words
I use to try to figure you out.

581
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,400
I'm sorry.

582
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,046
I just can't tell what's real
and what's made up anymore.

583
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,323
Then ask. It's what Annie does.

584
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,820
Ask who?

585
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,049
Us. We're your unit now.

586
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,403
Your favorite color is green.

587
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,251
Is that real?

588
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,371
Yeah. That's real.

589
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,410
Yours is orange.

590
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,563
Not bright orange.

591
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,041
Soft, like the sunset.

592
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,487
Thank you.

593
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,122
You're a painter.

594
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,363
You're a baker.

595
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,121
You always sleep with the windows open.

596
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,284
You never take sugar in your tea.

597
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,363
You always double-knot your shoelaces.

598
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,045
You were right.

599
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,369
I can't do this.

600
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,409
Guess we're not leavin' anymore.

601
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,082
We're not going anywhere
without that Holo.

602
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,480
Listen up.

603
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,646
Mag's empty.

604
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,850
It's only for the propo.

605
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,531
Let's move.
We're headed five blocks north.

606
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,620
"To the citizens of The Capitol,
our war is not with you."

607
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,980
To the citizens of The Capitol,
our war is not with you.

608
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,340
"You will be a vital part of the democracy
that follows our victory."

609
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,260
Be a vital part of the democracy
that follows our victory.

610
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,442
- You got it.
- Okay.

611
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,530
Boggs. This is a good spot.

612
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,300
Through there, in the courtyard.

613
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,890
Okay, let us clear it.

614
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,760
Got a pod.

615
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,320
Split. Take cover.

616
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,889
Stay back.

617
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,060
All clear. Gale, Homes, with me.

618
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,924
Leegs, take the wings.

619
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,580
Everdeen, no!

620
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,727
Boggs!

621
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,180
- Hold your position!
- Boggs!

622
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,850
Grab the tourniquets from the bag.

623
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,660
Squeeze his legs as hard as you can.

624
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,780
It's okay.

625
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,882
The Holo. The Holo.

626
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,620
Unfit for command.

627
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,620
Transfer primary security clearance...

628
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,020
Say your name.

629
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,009
Katniss Everdeen.

630
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,201
What did you just do?

631
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,620
Katniss, don't trust them.

632
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,688
Kill Peeta, if you have to.

633
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,250
- Do what you came to do.
- Boggs? Boggs?

634
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,161
- Come on. Come on.
- He's gone. He's gone.

635
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,927
Go, go, go!

636
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,603
- This way!
- Keep moving.

637
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,020
Let's go, soldiers!

638
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,851
- Get to higher ground!
- Move!

639
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,645
Finnick!

640
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,248
- Peeta!
- Mitchell!

641
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,260
Come on, come on!

642
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,930
Settle!

643
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,340
Come on! Don't stop! Let's go!

644
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,180
Come on, come on! We gotta move!

645
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,611
Get inside!

646
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,180
Everybody, inside!
Go! Upstairs! Go! Hurry up!

647
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,281
Move!

648
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,363
- Go! Go!
- Move!

649
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,321
Keep moving!

650
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,882
Keep moving to the top!

651
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,286
Go!

652
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,561
Hey, hey! I got you.

653
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,044
It's slowing down.

654
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,168
Gamemakers are still
putting on quite a show.

655
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,100
- 451 to base. Over.
- Hey, we better move.

656
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,680
If Peacekeepers didn't know
where we were, they do now.

657
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,100
Those surveillance cameras caught us.

658
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,700
451 to base. Come in.

659
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,531
This is a bad spot. We need to move now.

660
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,161
451 to base. Over.

661
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,727
I can't get a signal.

662
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,847
But I can get us back to base.
Everdeen, give me the Holo.

663
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,643
Everdeen, what did I just say?
The Holo. Come on, let's go.

664
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,169
Boggs gave it to me.

665
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,420
What are you talking about?

666
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,180
He did. He transferred
security clearance to her.

667
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,441
I saw him.

668
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,365
And why would he do that?

669
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,740
I'm on special orders from Coin.

670
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,620
To do what?

671
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,563
To assassinate President Snow.

672
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,290
I don't believe that for one second.

673
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,540
As your new unit commander,

674
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,564
I order you to transfer security
clearance to me now.

675
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,729
I can't do that.

676
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,730
Let's not lose our heads here.

677
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,100
I'm not asking you again, Everdeen.

678
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,929
Give me that Holo.

679
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,046
She's telling the truth.
Plutarch wants it televised.

680
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,580
He thinks if we could film
the Mockingjay assassinating Snow,

681
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,288
it'll make The Capitol surrender
before the casualties get too high.

682
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,250
While we're arguing, there's 100
Peacekeepers on their way here.

683
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,765
Boggs promised me that when
the time came, you would help me.

684
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,809
All right, soldier, Holo's yours.

685
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,580
I don't think we're gonna
leave any footprints.

686
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,700
We should move now.
And those cameras outside

687
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,820
should be covered up by the oil.

688
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,300
She can't move forward like this.

689
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,961
Her leg is too bad.
We have to evacuate her.

690
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,380
I'm sorry.

691
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,482
I'll stay with her.

692
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,540
As soon as we make contact,

693
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,007
we will send somebody back. I promise you.

694
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,380
All right, everybody, move out.

695
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,050
- Let's get him up.
- Let's go!

696
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,211
Can you walk?

697
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:33,760
Come on, this way.

698
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,089
Get these curtains closed.

699
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,441
It's the Leegs.

700
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,610
Good afternoon. I'm Caesar Flickerman.

701
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:56,180
Here with our continuing coverage
of the defense of The Capitol.

702
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:01,020
Today, as our Peacekeepers
valiantly hold off the rebels,

703
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,900
our story takes a surprising twist.

704
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,820
Katniss Everdeen,
our once favorite daughter,

705
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,620
has infiltrated the city
with some of the Victors,

706
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,940
whose names are all too familiar.

707
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,487
Finnick Odair and Peeta Mellark.

708
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,202
Clearly, some alliances
don't last forever.

709
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,900
Take a look at what happened
just a moment ago,

710
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,020
when our Peacekeepers cornered
Katniss Everdeen

711
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,700
and her band of foolish rebels.

712
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,380
Whatever arrogance

713
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,660
brought this treacherous girl back to us,

714
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,900
you are about to witness a great victory,

715
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,731
not only for The Capitol, but for Panem.

716
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,020
So there you have it.

717
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,180
Katniss Everdeen, the Girl on Fire,

718
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,060
a girl who inspired so much violence,

719
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,926
seems to have met a violent end herself.

720
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,166
Stay tuned for more information.
Caesar Flickerman. Thank you.

721
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,140
So now that we're dead,
what are we gonna do?

722
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,844
Isn't it obvious?

723
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,843
The next move is to kill me.

724
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,527
I murdered one of our squad members.

725
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,891
Katniss is right.

726
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,288
I'm a mutt.

727
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,088
And it's only a matter of time
before I snap again.

728
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,049
I'm not in control.

729
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,180
I need a nightlock pill,
so I can die when I need to.

730
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,647
If it gets to that point,
I'll kill you myself.

731
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,568
I don't think I ever really understood
The Capitol until now.

732
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,843
You eat like this,
you'll believe anything.

733
00:59:55,640 --> 01:00:00,020
So Katniss Everdeen, a poor unstable girl

734
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,380
with nothing but a small talent

735
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:05,201
with a bow and arrow, is dead.

736
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,700
Not a thinker, not a leader.

737
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:12,060
Simply a face plucked from the masses.

738
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,860
Was she valuable?

739
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,220
She was extremely valuable
to your rebellion

740
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:22,042
because you have no vision,
no true leader among you.

741
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,220
You call yourselves an alliance.

742
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,820
But we saw what that means.

743
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,163
Your soldiers are at each other's throats.

744
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,980
Good evening. For those of you
who don't know me,

745
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,980
please, allow me to introduce myself.

746
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:46,580
I am President Alma Coin,
leader of the rebellion.

747
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,260
I have interrupted a broadcast
from your President

748
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:53,300
in which he attempted to
defame a brave young woman.

749
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:57,380
"A face picked from
the masses," he called her.

750
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,460
Plucked.

751
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:04,220
As if a leader, a true leader,
could be anything else.

752
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,900
I had the privilege of knowing

753
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,700
a small-town girl
from the Seam in District 12

754
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,700
who survived the Hunger Games
and the Quarter Quell

755
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,140
and rose up and turned

756
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,562
a nation of slaves into an army!

757
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,300
Dead or alive, Katniss Everdeen

758
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,482
will remain the face of this revolution.

759
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,380
She will not have died for nothing.

760
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,700
I had no idea I meant so much to her.

761
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,140
Her vision and ours will be realized.

762
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:39,460
A free Panem
with self-determination for all.

763
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:42,900
And in her memory,
we will all find the strength

764
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,900
to rid Panem of its oppressors.

765
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,322
Thank you. And be safe.

766
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,441
Snow's in his mansion. Where is that?

767
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,045
That's us.

768
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,900
That's the City Circle.

769
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,322
It's at least 70, 75 blocks north.

770
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,740
- Seventy-five blocks?
- Uh-huh.

771
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,571
Nobody knows we're alive.
This is our chance.

772
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,540
These buildings. Do these
look over Snow's gardens?

773
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,340
- I...
- They do.

774
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,420
If he goes outside at all,
I could get a clear shot.

775
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,602
We're getting ahead of ourselves here.

776
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,860
Whether they're looking for us
or not, we are pinned down.

777
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,769
Hit that button. Scan for pods.

778
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,660
Just about every ten steps.

779
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,100
Yeah, that doesn't even show the new ones.

780
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,328
So we can't go anywhere in the streets.

781
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,965
And the rooftops are just as bad.

782
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,762
There might be another way.

783
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,687
My brother knows
these tunnels really well.

784
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,060
He worked sanitation down here.

785
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,003
Right after they made him an Avox.

786
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,360
Hey. Hey.

787
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:16,888
You gonna be okay? Look at me. Look at me.

788
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,807
We're gonna get through this. I promise.

789
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,740
Took us five years to
buy his way outta here.

790
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,808
He didn't see the sun once.

791
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,286
We're too exposed here.

792
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,890
Sir, should I call for your doctor?

793
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:54,930
- What did you say?
- Shall I call for your doctor?

794
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:01,420
I hope you've wakened me for something
more urgent than an old man's health.

795
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,808
They survived. I don't know how.

796
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,980
We picked them up on a surveillance cam.

797
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:10,129
Let me see. I... I need to see for myself.

798
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,731
It's her.

799
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,206
It is her.

800
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,131
The arena has moved underground.

801
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:44,721
Looks clear.

802
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,200
Everybody okay?

803
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:14,567
Yeah.

804
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,682
All right, everybody, we're gonna stop here
for a bit and get some rest, yeah?

805
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,930
I'll take first watch.

806
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,806
Hey, Peeta. Just tuck in there.

807
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,845
All right, settle in, everybody.

808
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,970
Katniss. Your watch.

809
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,486
You know, The Capitol,
they used tracker jacker venom on me.

810
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,844
That's what the doctors in 13 said.

811
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,128
You were stung once, too.

812
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,250
Real or not real?

813
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,620
Real.

814
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,620
When they used the venom on me,

815
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,326
they would show me pictures of my life.

816
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,811
But some weren't real.

817
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,204
They changed them.

818
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:31,220
At first, they all...
They all blurred together.

819
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:35,769
But now... Now I can
sort them out a little.

820
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,420
Like the ones that they changed,

821
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:41,020
they have this quality...

822
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:45,125
It's like they're shiny.
They've been glossed over.

823
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,851
You should get some rest.

824
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,580
You're still trying to protect me.

825
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,170
Real or not real?

826
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,971
Real.

827
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,965
That's what you and I do.

828
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,443
Keep each other alive.

829
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:18,729
Katniss. Katniss. Katniss.

830
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:26,086
Katniss?

831
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,300
What is that?

832
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,940
We gotta go. We gotta get outta here now.

833
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,122
- Keep your voice down.
- Mutts! They released mutts.

834
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,300
Pollux, what's the fastest way out?

835
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,050
Come on! Go! Go!

836
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,980
- Go! Go! Go! It's mutts!
- Come on, come on, come on!

837
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,605
Pollux, lead us out of here!

838
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,841
Come on!

839
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:44,486
Castor!

840
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,365
Fall back!

841
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,360
Move!

842
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,882
Katniss, come on! Move!

843
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:40,961
Katniss!

844
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,922
Go, go, go, go, go!

845
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,325
Go, go, go!

846
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,084
Katniss!

847
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,251
- No!
- Finnick!

848
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:04,970
Finnick!

849
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,140
Katniss!

850
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:14,802
Nightlock. Nightlock. Nightlock.

851
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,860
Come on, come on,
come on, come on. Let's go.

852
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,007
Keep moving! Keep moving!

853
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,247
Ow!

854
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,980
Go! Go!

855
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,650
Keep going! Keep going!

856
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:12,727
Peeta, come on!

857
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,121
Peeta!

858
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:18,020
Peeta, we have to keep going!

859
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,940
I'm a mutt! I can't keep control!

860
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:21,500
- Yes, you can!
- Leave me! I'm a mutt!

861
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,443
Look at me! Look at me.

862
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,926
Stay with me.

863
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,620
Always.

864
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:33,801
Come on.

865
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,100
I know where we are!

866
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,123
I know a place. Up those stairs.

867
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:47,846
Keep going.

868
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,561
Someone's coming.

869
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,965
Shut the door, shut the door!

870
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,964
No, Katniss, it's okay, it's okay.

871
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,686
It's okay.

872
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:24,820
Tigris, do you remember me?

873
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:27,660
I'm with Plutarch's underground.

874
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,180
We need your help.

875
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,281
Clear!

876
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:00,167
I know you.
You were a stylist in the Games.

877
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,009
Until Snow decided I wasn't
pretty enough anymore.

878
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,011
I'm here to kill him.

879
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,171
Gale's gonna need stitches.

880
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,805
I made it up.

881
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,766
All of it.

882
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,500
There is no special mission from Coin.

883
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,125
There's only my plan.

884
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,447
Everyone that's dead is dead
because of me. I lied.

885
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,660
We know. We all knew.

886
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,940
- The soldiers from 13?
- They did, too.

887
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,960
Do you really believe that Jackson
thought you had orders from Coin?

888
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:43,170
She trusted Boggs and he clearly
wanted you to go on.

889
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,125
I never meant for this to happen.

890
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,050
I failed. I...

891
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:58,848
I killed them. I killed Finnick.

892
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,809
I'm sorry, Pollux.

893
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,285
I'm so sorry.

894
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:10,729
Glimmer, Marvel, Mags...

895
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:18,483
Clove, Wiress, Rue.

896
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,009
What do all those deaths mean?

897
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,644
They mean that our lives were never ours.

898
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,284
There was no real life because
we didn't have any choice.

899
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,689
Our lives belong to Snow
and our deaths do, too.

900
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,449
But if you kill him, Katniss...

901
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,604
If you end all of this,

902
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:55,521
all those deaths, they mean something.

903
01:22:57,240 --> 01:23:01,529
Cinna, Boggs, Castor,

904
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,768
Jackson, Finnick.

905
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,566
They chose this.

906
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:14,681
They chose you.

907
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,940
You should keep these clean.

908
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,565
Otherwise they'll get infected.

909
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:28,366
You should cuff me.

910
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,404
It's not safe with me yet.

911
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:34,206
I have moments when I'm here.

912
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,566
And my memories are getting better, but...

913
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,249
other times it's like I'm sleepwalking.

914
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,246
You should cuff me.

915
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,660
Thanks.

916
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,921
No problem.

917
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,524
I can't sleep.

918
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,610
Yeah, I haven't slept in days, either.

919
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,290
I should've volunteered to take
your place in the first Games.

920
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,091
No, you couldn't have.

921
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,140
No, she never would have forgiven you.

922
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:46,245
She needed you to be there
and take care of her family and you did.

923
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,121
She can't lose you.

924
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:52,721
She really loves you.

925
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,642
And the way she kissed you
in the Quarter Quell.

926
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:02,300
She never kissed me like that.

927
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,620
Oh, just part of the show.

928
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,803
No. No, you won her over.

929
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,724
You gave up everything for her.

930
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:17,487
Well, it's not gonna be
an issue much longer.

931
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,100
I doubt all three of us
are gonna make it out of this.

932
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,929
And if we do, then...

933
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,323
it's her problem who to choose, right?

934
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,380
Yeah.

935
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,650
I do know that Katniss will pick
whoever she can't survive without.

936
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,844
Mortar shells. It's not ours.

937
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,211
Peacekeepers must be shellin'
the rebels outside the city.

938
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,763
That's not outside the city.

939
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,845
Sun's comin' up.

940
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,140
There's some small-arms fire.
Could be Paylor, maybe Lyme.

941
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,820
Rebels are close.

942
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,160
This is it.

943
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:12,860
To all Capitol citizens

944
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,140
more than a half mile
outside the City Circle,

945
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:19,820
I am announcing a mandatory evacuation.

946
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,940
Come to the mansion.

947
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:24,700
I am promising you shelter and sanctuary.

948
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:29,220
All refugees, come to my home.

949
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,860
There you will be provided with food,

950
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:36,020
medicine, safety for your children,

951
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,804
and you will have my solemn oath

952
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:41,140
to protect you until my dying breath.

953
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:42,940
Wish he'd hurry up with that last part.

954
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:47,420
Our enemy is not like us.
They do not share our values.

955
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:51,620
They have never known our comfort
and our sophistication.

956
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:55,180
And they despise us for it.
Make no mistake.

957
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:58,204
They are not coming to liberate us.

958
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,569
They are coming
to destroy our way of life.

959
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:05,921
They are coming to bury us.

960
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:09,523
Is he still in the mansion?

961
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,126
Peeta?

962
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:14,891
Yeah. I recognize the room.

963
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:17,321
Where is that?

964
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,445
About five blocks away.

965
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,940
We're right here. Off the Avenues.

966
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,380
Mansion's here.

967
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,060
What about the pods?

968
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:32,260
They'll probably deactivate the pods
around here for the residents' safety.

969
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:36,220
That could work. I could get close enough.

970
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,260
Every Peacekeeper's gonna be waiting.

971
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,089
Next to our faces on every billboard.

972
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,922
Snow's offering shelter
to all the refugees.

973
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:50,980
Head straight north.

974
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,220
There's gonna be thousands of refugees.

975
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:55,288
Just get into that stream
and don't look up.

976
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,049
We got one shot.

977
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,286
Let's make it count.

978
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,325
Good luck, Katniss.

979
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,446
Thank you.

980
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,047
Pollux.

981
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:28,460
Tigris, thank you
for everything you've done.

982
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,780
Katniss, let me come with you, okay?

983
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,820
I can be a good distraction.
They know my face.

984
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:35,220
- No, I'm not losing you again.
- You'll be safer with us.

985
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,620
What if Peacekeepers
are searching the houses?

986
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:38,420
And if he's captured...

987
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:41,126
Then give me a nightlock pill, okay?
I'm not goin' back.

988
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,165
Stay alive.

989
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,361
If I see you again,
it's gonna be a different world.

990
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:33,770
Ready, Katniss?

991
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,281
Let's go.

992
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:54,180
By order of President Snow,

993
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:57,700
all residents must proceed
to the Presidential Estate.

994
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,860
Please, continue to move forward

995
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:03,420
in a calm and orderly fashion.

996
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,580

will be provided upon arrival.

998
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,540

will be provided upon arrival.

1016
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,328
By order of President Snow...

1017
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:10,980
Keep moving.

1018
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:13,540
...all residents must proceed
to the Presidential Estate.

1019
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,540
Please, continue to move forward

1020
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:18,900
in a calm and orderly fashion.

1021
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,300
Additional food, medicine and clothing

1022
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,846
will be provided upon arrival.

1023
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:23,300
It's the rebels!

1024
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,020
The rebels are attacking!

1025
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,407
- Rebels!
- Rebels!

1026
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,889
Run! Run!

1027
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:41,887
Mama! Mama!

1028
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:43,406
Come on!

1029
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:00,651
Come on, come on!

1030
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,445
Shoot me!

1031
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:43,961
Shoot me!

1032
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,740
Stay calm.

1033
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,968
Bring your children forward.

1034
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,446
The gates will open momentarily.

1035
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,680
The children will be received first.

1036
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,940
Stay calm.

1037
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,281
Bring your children forward.

1038
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:53,180
The gates will open momentarily.

1039
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:56,620
The children will be received first.

1040
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:57,980
Mom!

1041
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,580
Stay calm.

1042
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:01,205
Bring your children forward.

1043
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:05,860
The gates will open momentarily.

1044
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:08,361
The children will be received first.

1045
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:20,561
It's The Capitol!

1046
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,731
Gifts from The Capitol!

1047
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:37,001
Gifts!

1048
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:22,566
Medic!

1049
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:26,605
Medic!

1050
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,860
- Medic!
- Make a hole!

1051
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,564
Medics coming in!

1052
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:33,284
Bring a stretcher!

1053
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,080
This way, this way!

1054
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:38,800
Prim?

1055
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,681
Primrose!

1056
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:43,845
Prim!

1057
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:26,003
Hey. I need you to lie back.

1058
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,082
You're okay. Everything's gonna be okay.

1059
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:37,620
Fight was over after The Capitol

1060
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:39,848
dropped those bombs to defend the palace.

1061
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,365
The rebels walked right in.

1062
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:49,210
Don't, Katniss. The ointment's working.

1063
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,086
Everybody felt it.

1064
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:58,568
Peacekeepers, palace guards.
They had kids in there, too.

1065
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:01,041
It was...

1066
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,210
It was over after that.

1067
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:19,960
Mom?

1068
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:36,567
I remember the first time
I brought you here.

1069
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:40,206
And here we are.

1070
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,963
I brought all your things.

1071
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:57,928
Well, I'll leave you to get settled.

1072
01:40:22,280 --> 01:40:24,460
Sorry, ma'am. Can't let you pass.

1073
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,340
Let her in.

1074
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:28,540
On my authority.

1075
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:30,449
She has a right to anything
behind that door.

1076
01:40:57,960 --> 01:40:59,644
That's a nice one.

1077
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,882
The colors are lovely, of course.

1078
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:06,122
But nothing says perfection like white.

1079
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,202
I was hoping you'd find your way here.

1080
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:14,321
There are so many things
we should discuss.

1081
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:21,700
But I have a feeling
your visit will be brief,

1082
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:24,371
so first things first.

1083
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:37,126
I wanted to tell you how very sorry
I am about your sister.

1084
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:42,780
So wasteful. So unnecessary.

1085
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:46,009
Anyone could see the game
was over by that point.

1086
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:49,100
In fact, I was just about to
issue an official surrender

1087
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:51,060
when they released those parachutes.

1088
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:53,580
You released those parachutes.

1089
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:56,100
You really think I gave the order?

1090
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:58,248
We both know I'm not
above killing children.

1091
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:01,247
But I'm not wasteful.

1092
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:05,100
I take life for specific reasons.

1093
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:09,220
And there was no reason for me to destroy
a pen full of Capitol children.

1094
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:10,890
None at all.

1095
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:21,204
I must concede, it was
a masterful move on Coin's part.

1096
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:24,740
The idea that I was bombing

1097
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:28,049
our own helpless children
to hold back the rebels...

1098
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:31,970
It turned the last of
my guards against me.

1099
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:36,200
There was no resistance left
inside The Capitol or the mansion.

1100
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:40,004
Do you know it aired live?

1101
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:45,809
There's a particular savvy
in that, isn't there?

1102
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:53,566
I'm sure she wasn't
gunning for your sister, but...

1103
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:56,969
these things happen in war.

1104
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:03,882
My failure was in being so
slow to grasp Coin's plan.

1105
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:08,900
She let The Capitol and the Districts
destroy one another,

1106
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:12,800
then she stepped in to
take power with 13's arsenal.

1107
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:17,180
Oh, make no mistake,

1108
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:19,248
she intends to take my place now.

1109
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:24,045
But I've been watching you.

1110
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:27,529
And you watching me.

1111
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:31,646
I'm afraid we've both
been played for fools.

1112
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:36,801
I don't believe you.

1113
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:41,380
Oh, my dear Miss Everdeen.

1114
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:45,565
I thought we'd agreed
never to lie to each other.

1115
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:05,011
President Coin asked for you.

1116
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:07,924
You never came to see me.

1117
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,340
I wanted to, but...

1118
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:14,646
Was it ours?

1119
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,126
The bomb.

1120
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:20,649
The delayed explosion.

1121
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:23,720
The trap.

1122
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,730
To draw more people in.

1123
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:32,047
Was that you?

1124
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,040
I don't know.

1125
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,089
All I know is...

1126
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:42,321
that I was supposed to
take care of your family.

1127
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,204
Now I'm sorry I couldn't.

1128
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,207
You can't protect anyone in an arena.

1129
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:14,486
Goodbye, Gale.

1130
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:33,380
What's this?

1131
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:35,801
The remaining Victors. Won't you join us?

1132
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:50,740
I have invited you all here
for several reasons,

1133
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,020
but first, I have an announcement.

1134
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:56,300
I have taken the burden and the honor

1135
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:59,722
of declaring myself
Interim President of Panem.

1136
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:06,620
Interim? Exactly how long is that interim?

1137
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:09,420
We have no way of knowing for certain.

1138
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,500
But it's clear that people
are far too emotional right now

1139
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,860
to make a rational decision.

1140
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,420
We'll plan an election
when the time is right.

1141
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:22,620
But I have called you here
for a far more important vote.

1142
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:24,980
A symbolic vote.

1143
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:28,402
This afternoon, we will execute Snow.

1144
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:32,660
Hundreds of his accomplices
also await their deaths.

1145
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:37,740
Capitol officials, Peacekeepers,
torturers, Gamemakers.

1146
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,860
But the danger is, once we begin,

1147
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:43,100
the rebels will not stop
calling for retribution.

1148
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:46,488
Thirst for blood is
a difficult urge to satisfy.

1149
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:52,003
So I offer an alternative plan.

1150
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:55,411
Majority of four may approve it.
No one may abstain.

1151
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,008
The proposal is this:

1152
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:03,922
In lieu of these barbaric executions,

1153
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:08,128
we hold a symbolic Hunger Games.

1154
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:23,206
You wanna have another Hunger Games
with The Capitol's children?

1155
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:27,442
- You're joking?
- Not in the slightest.

1156
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:30,286
Is this Plutarch's idea?

1157
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,120
It was mine.

1158
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:36,740
It balances the need for revenge

1159
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:39,446
with the least loss of human life.

1160
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,803
- You may cast your votes.
- No.

1161
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,980
No, obviously not. This is crazy.

1162
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,460
I think it's more than fair.
Snow's got a granddaughter.

1163
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:49,860
I say "yes."

1164
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:52,540
So do I. Let them have a taste of it.

1165
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:55,740
You guys, this way of thinking
is what started these uprisings.

1166
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:59,380
I vote "no." With Peeta.

1167
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:00,780
So would Finnick, if he were here.

1168
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:02,140
Well, he's not.

1169
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:04,368
- Because Snow killed him.
- No.

1170
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:09,211
We need to stop viewing
each other as enemies.

1171
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,649
It's down to Katniss and Haymitch.

1172
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:21,088
I get to kill Snow.

1173
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:24,202
I expected no less of you.

1174
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:31,884
Then I vote "yes."

1175
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,171
For Prim.

1176
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:39,446
Haymitch?

1177
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,962
I'm with the Mockingjay.

1178
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:55,851
That carries the vote.

1179
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,540
Excellent.

1180
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:01,689
We'll announce the Games tonight,
after the execution.

1181
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,847
Well, it's bound to be quite the show.

1182
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:15,407
Oh, you look lovely as ever.

1183
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:18,201
Just beautiful.

1184
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:22,564
Finishing touches.

1185
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:49,364
Welcome to the new Panem.

1186
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:54,721
Today, on the Avenue of the Tributes,

1187
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:59,460
all of Panem, a free Panem,

1188
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:02,484
will watch more than a mere spectacle.

1189
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:07,140
We are gathered to witness

1190
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:10,700
an historic moment of justice.

1191
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:15,220
Today, the greatest friend
to the revolution

1192
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:19,245
will fire the shot to end all wars.

1193
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:24,885
May her arrow signify the end of tyranny

1194
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:29,805
and the beginning of a new era.

1195
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:33,283
Mockingjay,

1196
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:38,260
may your aim be as true

1197
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:42,922
as your heart is pure.

1198
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:32,241
No!

1199
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:34,260
No!

1200
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:36,522
Kill him!

1201
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,843
Kill him! Kill him now!

1202
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,126
Kill him!

1203
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:01,163
I'll say this for you, Katniss.

1204
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:04,005
You don't disappoint.

1205
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:10,020
Well, Plutarch gave me a letter for you.

1206
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:11,121
I don't want it.

1207
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:13,682
You never make it easy, do you?

1208
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:18,563
Okay. I'll read it for you.

1209
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:24,300
"Katniss, maybe the country was
shocked tonight by your arrow,

1210
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,180
but once again, I was not.

1211
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:30,020
You were exactly who I believed you were.

1212
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:32,020
I wish I could give you a proper goodbye.

1213
01:54:32,120 --> 01:54:33,780
But with both Coin and Snow dead,

1214
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:35,980
the fate of the country
will be decided tonight,

1215
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:38,003
and I can't be seen at your side.

1216
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:43,180
Tonight, the 12 District leaders
will call for a free election.

1217
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:45,260
There's little doubt
that Paylor will carry it.

1218
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:47,140
She's become the voice of reason.

1219
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:51,020
I'm sorry so much burden fell on you.

1220
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:53,646
I know you'll never escape it.

1221
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:58,691
But if I had to put you through it
again for this outcome, I would.

1222
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:04,180
The war's over.
We'll enter that sweet period

1223
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:08,046
where everyone agrees not to
repeat the recent horrors.

1224
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:12,300
Of course, we're fickle, stupid
beings, with poor memories

1225
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:15,165
and a great gift for self.destruction.

1226
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:19,729
Although, who knows?
Maybe this time, we'll learn.

1227
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:24,180
I've secured you a ride
out of The Capitol.

1228
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:26,100
It's better for you to be out of sight.

1229
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:29,568
And when the time is right,
Commander Paylor will pardon you.

1230
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:32,620
The country will find its peace.

1231
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:35,041
I hope you can find yours.

1232
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:36,930
Plutarch."

1233
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:40,967
What now?

1234
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:45,140
Home.

1235
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:47,447
We go home.

1236
01:55:52,360 --> 01:55:54,761
I couldn't let you go
without a proper goodbye.

1237
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:03,566
It's your job to take care
of yourself now, Katniss.

1238
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:08,964
Promise me you'll find it.

1239
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:11,726
Find what?

1240
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:15,562
The life of a Victor.

1241
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:19,887
- Goodbye, Effie.
- Goodbye, my girl.

1242
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:26,443
Effie, don't be a stranger.

1243
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,840
- Take care of her.
- I will.

1244
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:06,720
She's gone.

1245
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:16,205
Get out!

1246
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:21,860
Get out! Prim is gone!

1247
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:23,962
Prim is gone!

1248
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:26,620
She's dead! And she's not coming back!

1249
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:29,564
Get out! Get out!

1250
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:04,246
Peeta?

1251
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:09,606
Hey.

1252
02:00:11,240 --> 02:00:12,924
You came home.

1253
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,206
Yeah.

1254
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:24,529
I found these, uh,
out by the edge of the forest.

1255
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:29,801
It's a primrose.

1256
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,760
So sorry, Katniss.

1257
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:55,740
"You'll be happy to hear
that Katniss' mother

1258
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:58,260
has been training new medical
units in The Capitol.

1259
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:00,860
Gale has been promoted
to a captain in District 2

1260
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:03,281
to help keep order and security.

1261
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:05,580
And I am loving every moment with my son

1262
02:01:05,680 --> 02:01:08,300
who reminds me every day of his father.

1263
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:10,129
We've all suffered so much,

1264
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:13,180
but we owe it to their memories
and to our children

1265
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:15,780
to do our best with these lives.

1266
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:18,884
I hope you're both finding some peace.

1267
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:20,365
Annie."

1268
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:31,340
I solemnly swear

1269
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:35,580
to the best of my ability,
to preserve, protect,

1270
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:39,162
and uphold the rights
of every citizen of Panem.

1271
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:41,726
There's Plutarch,
right in the middle of it all.

1272
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:45,041
And they say no one ever wins the Games.

1273
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:06,125
You love me.

1274
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,684
Real or not real?

1275
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:13,406
Real.

1276
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:11,089
Did you have a nightmare?

1277
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:14,490
I have nightmares, too.

1278
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:23,567
Someday I'll explain it to you.

1279
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:29,768
Why they came,
why they won't ever go away.

1280
02:04:37,480 --> 02:04:39,642
But I'll tell you how I survive it.

1281
02:04:41,480 --> 02:04:44,100
I make a list in my head

1282
02:04:44,200 --> 02:04:46,931
of all the good things
I've seen someone do.

1283
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:51,205
Every little thing I can remember.

1284
02:04:54,280 --> 02:04:56,420
It's like a game.

1285
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:58,966
I do it over and over.

1286
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:04,529
Gets a little tedious
after all these years, but...

1287
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:08,880
there are much worse games to play.
