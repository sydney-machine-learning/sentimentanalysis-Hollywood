MINSK
BELARUS

3
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,598
Benji.

4
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,800
Benji, do you copy?

5
00:01:15,294 --> 00:01:16,909
Benji.

6
00:01:17,314 --> 00:01:19,341
Oh. 
Shit.

7
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:20,808
Where's Ethan?

8
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,488
Uh.
I can't talk right now.

9
00:01:22,513 --> 00:01:24,919
The package is on the plane.

10
00:01:24,944 --> 00:01:26,514
Yeah, I know.

11
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:30,442
We're currently formulate a plan B
although technically, it's a plan C.

12
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:31,840
This isn't going very well.

13
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,165
I am aware of that, Brandt.
You're not helping.

14
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:35,299
Where's Ethan?

15
00:01:35,324 --> 00:01:36,777
I don't know.
We're on radio silence.

16
00:01:36,802 --> 00:01:39,548
That plane cannot takeoff,
with the package on it.

17
00:01:39,573 --> 00:01:41,672
- You understand?
- We're working on it.

18
00:01:41,704 --> 00:01:43,779
Luther?  What the hell 
are you doing there?

19
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,569
You are supposed to be on
an assignment in Malaysia.

20
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:48,621
I'm in Malaysia, I've been here 2 days.
Benji needed my help.

21
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:52,160
I didn't need help. I just- 
I needed assistance, it's a different thing.

22
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:54,504
The package is still 
on that plane.

23
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,663
We understand the package
is on the plane.

24
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:00,140
- We're trying to cripple it remotely.
- You can do that.

25
00:02:00,165 --> 00:02:02,931
We can if the pilot left the
satellite uplink switch on.

26
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,305
- Which he has.
- And how do you access the uplink?

27
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,855
- It involves hacking a Russian satellite.
- I can't authorise that.

28
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,697
Which is why 
I didn't ask permission.

29
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:13,178
We are under investigation 
for misconduct.

30
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:16,599
The package is on-board. 
What do you want me to do?

31
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:26,436
Uh.
Luther.

32
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:29,111
I'm reading a heat bloom, Benji.
The engines are starting.

33
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:30,695
Yeah.
I'm aware of that.

34
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,233
But I can't do anything until
I'm connected to the satellite.

35
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:37,401
Benji, you are connected.
- Okay, Great.

36
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,804
The package is still 
on that plane.

37
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,710
Shut down the fuel pump.

38
00:02:42,735 --> 00:02:44,561
Uh.
Mechanical are lockdown.

39
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:47,746
- What about the electrical system?
- Oh, that might work.

40
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:48,556
No.
No.

41
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:50,440
- Hydraulics.
- Okay, standby.

42
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:52,450
No, they're encrypted.

43
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:55,002
Benji, the plane.

44
00:02:55,027 --> 00:02:56,740
Yes! The package
is on the plane!

45
00:02:56,765 --> 00:02:58,625
We get it!

46
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:02,167
Can you open the door?

47
00:03:02,192 --> 00:03:04,535
- Ethan? Where are you?
- I'm by the plane.

48
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,472
Benji, can you open the door?

49
00:03:06,497 --> 00:03:09,226
Uh. Can I open the door? 
Uh. Maybe.

50
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:11,763
Open the door when I tell you.

51
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,572
I'm on the plane. 
Open the door.

52
00:03:27,597 --> 00:03:28,737
How did you 
get in the plane?

53
00:03:28,762 --> 00:03:31,506
Not in the plane,
I'm on the plane!

54
00:03:31,531 --> 00:03:33,798
Open the door!

55
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:40,359
Benji. 
Open the door!

56
00:03:40,384 --> 00:03:42,915
Yeah-yeah-yeah... 
Okay, okay.

57
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,690
- Benji, open that door right now!
- Yeah, I am trying.

58
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:07,260
- Come on, Benji.
- Benji, open that door!

59
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:09,673
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

60
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,287
Come on. 
Yes, got it.

61
00:04:22,657 --> 00:04:24,510
That's the wrong door!

62
00:04:24,535 --> 00:04:26,796
Benji, not that door.
The other door.

63
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:28,619
The other door. 
Right. Yes, the other door.

64
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:31,852
Okay, yes, yes.  Sorry, sorry.
My bad, my bad.

65
00:04:36,888 --> 00:04:38,548
Check it out.

66
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:40,767
Alright. Look, I'm gonna
open the para-door.

67
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:42,617
How's that?

68
00:05:11,206 --> 00:05:13,221
Hey. 
Hey.

69
00:05:59,003 --> 00:06:01,604
LONDON
ENGLAND

70
00:06:28,247 --> 00:06:30,063
We're about to close.

71
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:31,933
I won't be long.

72
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,613
You looking for
anything in particular.

73
00:06:35,242 --> 00:06:37,770
Something rare.

74
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:43,063
Let me guess.

75
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:46,028
Classical.

76
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:47,053
Jazz.

77
00:06:47,078 --> 00:06:49,195
- Sax.
- Coltrain.

78
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,391
- Piano.
- Monk.

79
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,962
Shadow Wilson on the bass.

80
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:56,748
Shadow Wilson played drums.

81
00:06:57,192 --> 00:06:59,840
Know why
they called him Shadow?

82
00:06:59,865 --> 00:07:02,543
Because he had a light touch.

83
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:05,036
You're in luck.

84
00:07:06,477 --> 00:07:08,804
I've a first pressing.

85
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:19,158
It really is you.

86
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:23,859
I've heard stories.

87
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:26,325
They can't all be true.

88
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,752
Good even, Mr. Hunt.

89
00:07:49,777 --> 00:07:53,502
The weapons you recovered in Belarus
were confirmed to be VX nerve gas.

90
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:56,250
Capable of devastating
a major city.

91
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,121
The bodies of the air crew
were found less than

92
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:01,038
24 hours after they
landed in Damascus.

93
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:04,080
They were identified as
low level Chechen separatist.

94
00:08:04,105 --> 00:08:05,978
With neither the
access nor the ability

95
00:08:06,003 --> 00:08:09,116
to acquire the weapons
they were transporting.

96
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:10,859
This would support your suspicion

97
00:08:10,884 --> 00:08:14,110
that a shadow organization is
committed to inciting revolution.

98
00:08:14,134 --> 00:08:18,319
by enabling acts of terror in
nations friendly to Western interests.

99
00:08:18,345 --> 00:08:21,322
IMF suspects this to be the
same shadow organization

100
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:23,605
you have been tracking
for the last year

101
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,993
Also known as the Syndicate.

102
00:08:26,018 --> 00:08:28,397
IMF would be right.

103
00:08:28,422 --> 00:08:30,671
Normally, you and your
team would be tasked

104
00:08:30,696 --> 00:08:33,662
with infiltrating and disrupting
this terrorist network,

105
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:37,338
but we have taken steps to
ensure that this will not happen.

106
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:40,022
Because, we, are the Syndicate,
Mr. Hunt.

107
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:42,734
And now we know
who you are.

108
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,059
Your mission, should you
choose to accept it,

109
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:46,709
is to face your fate.

110
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,891
Pursue us, you'll be caught.
Resist us, you'll be killed.

111
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:55,065
And you precious Secretary will
disavow any knowledge of your actions.

112
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,409
Good luck, Mr. Hunt.

113
00:08:56,434 --> 00:09:00,625
This message will self destruct
in 5 seconds.

114
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:55,148
Mr. Chairman, the IMF's misadventures
date back to my earliest days in the CIA

115
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:59,829
when the IMF broke into the CIA
to steal a list of covert operatives.

116
00:09:59,854 --> 00:10:02,840
- And now, more recently a Russian warhead.
- Disarmed Russian warhead.

117
00:10:02,865 --> 00:10:05,658
- A Russian nuclear warhead.
- Branded safe by Th IMF.

118
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:09,074
Clipped the Transamerica Pyramid
before plunging into the San Francisco bay.

119
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:10,613
Saving the western atmosphere.

120
00:10:10,638 --> 00:10:13,168
This made possible by IMF
 agents who did willing

121
00:10:13,193 --> 00:10:16,304
provide the launch codes
to a known terrorist.

122
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:19,175
Do I have that right, agent Brandt?

123
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:23,890
I can neither confirm nor deny details of any
such operation without Secretary's approval.

124
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,836
This was the same week after
IMF infiltrated the Kremlin.

125
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:29,327
Here's the Kremlin before.

126
00:10:30,184 --> 00:10:32,823
And the Kremlin after.

127
00:10:34,698 --> 00:10:37,477
I can neither confirm nor
deny details of any operation...

128
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:39,256
Without the Secretary's approval.
Yes, we know.

129
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:41,779
In fact, until this panel
appoints a new Secretary,

130
00:10:41,804 --> 00:10:44,221
you really can't say much of anything,
can you, agent Brandt?

131
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:45,785
Well.
I didn't write the rules, Mr. Hunley.

132
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,528
Mr. Chairman, the so call
Impossible Missions Force

133
00:10:48,568 --> 00:10:52,008
is not just a rogue organization,
it is an outdated one.

134
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:55,905
A throwback to an era without
transparency and without oversight.

135
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,336
- Mr. Chairman.
- The time has come to dissolve the IMF.

136
00:10:58,361 --> 00:11:02,504
- Mr. Chairman.
- And transfer the salvageable assets to the CIA.

137
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,827
Mr. Chairman, the IMF has operated
without oversight for 40 years.

138
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:08,266
- Now, are its methods unorthodox?
  Yes.
- Mr. Chairman.

139
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,451
Are it's results less than perfect?
Absolutely.

140
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,059
- But without the IMF, to be force...
- There'll be order and stability.

141
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:16,247
Without the IMF...

142
00:11:17,398 --> 00:11:22,551
This panel recognizes the IMF's
contribution to global security.

143
00:11:22,576 --> 00:11:25,874
But the events laid out by
CIA director Hunley

144
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:28,929
also show a pattern of
 once and brinkmanship

145
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,860
and a total disregard for protocol.

146
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:33,106
From where I sit,

147
00:11:33,131 --> 00:11:37,100
you unorthodox methods are
indistinguishable from chance.

148
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:40,204
And your results,
perfect or not,

149
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:42,948
looked suspiciously like luck.

150
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:48,750
I'm afraid today is the day
when the IMF's luck runs out.

151
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,559
What are you doing here?

152
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:31,619
Huh?

153
00:13:34,351 --> 00:13:37,298
I said: "What are you doing here?"

154
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:47,694
What does he see in you, I wonder.

155
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:49,657
Who is he?

156
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,045
I want to see what is done.

157
00:13:57,185 --> 00:13:59,511
Why don't you
take off the cuffs.

158
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:01,683
And I'll show you.

159
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,481
Vinter.

160
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:08,831
You know who I am?

161
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:10,930
Janik Vinter.

162
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:14,947
They call you,
the bone doctor.

163
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,139
The funny thing is.

164
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:22,272
You're officially declared dead,
3 years ago.

165
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:24,456
Nice shoes by the way.

166
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:27,795
Not his.

167
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,720
Yours.

168
00:14:36,156 --> 00:14:38,722
We have instructions to talk,

169
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:40,193
not to kill him.

170
00:14:40,218 --> 00:14:43,342
There are men who are
broken in different ways.

171
00:14:44,838 --> 00:14:46,862
This one's a fighter.

172
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,486
He'll die,
before you turn him.

173
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:52,283
Are you worry he's
gonna take your place?

174
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:07,285
You should go,
before it gets ugly.

175
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,929
Yeah, he's right.

176
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,975
You should go.

177
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:30,841
Now, let's see how tough you are.

178
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:33,981
You, Janik.

179
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,177
We've never met before, right?

180
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,707
Follow me.

181
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:12,434
Give me the gun.

182
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:18,569
- What're you doing?
- I can't leave.

183
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:20,662
Look. You can't stay.
We just killed those men.

184
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:22,868
We didn't kill them.
You did.

185
00:17:22,893 --> 00:17:26,476
I tried to stop you.
You got away.

186
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:29,611
Who are you?

187
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:32,750
You better hurry now.
Good luck.

188
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:34,441
No, wait.
Wait!

189
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:35,596
Where is he?

190
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,109
He's heading to the north corridor.
He has closed the gate.

191
00:17:38,134 --> 00:17:41,304
Hurry, don't let him escape.
Quick!

192
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,849
- Stack-com 7.
- Western Europe unsecured.

193
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,344
- Designator.
- Bravo Echo One One.

194
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,125
Connecting.

195
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,469
- This is Brandt.
- Go secure.

196
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:04,746
Go.

197
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:08,161
London terminal is compromised.
Repeat, London is compromised.

198
00:18:08,186 --> 00:18:11,168
Agent placed is down.
Request immediate extraction.

199
00:18:11,193 --> 00:18:13,197
What happened?
Who breached London?

200
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:14,875
Do you've anything to go on?

201
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:18,714
A face. He wanted something.
Not information.

202
00:18:18,739 --> 00:18:21,819
He could've kill me,
but he didn't.

203
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:25,500
- Okay, what do you think it means.
- The Syndicate is real.

204
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:28,287
They know who we're,
how we operate.

205
00:18:28,312 --> 00:18:31,028
I think I know why
they've been so hard to find.

206
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:36,188
Just focus operations on gathering any available
Intel regarding formal covert operatives.

207
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:38,248
It doesn't matter what
country or agency.

208
00:18:38,273 --> 00:18:40,713
Just as long as they are dead
Or presumed dead.

209
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:45,498
Start with Janik Vinter.
He's also known as the bone doctor.

210
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:47,809
- I can't do that.
- What?

211
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,845
What're you talking about?

212
00:18:50,134 --> 00:18:52,086
The Committee has shut us down.

213
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:55,283
Operations are to be
handled over to the CIA.

214
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:57,041
There is no more IMF.

215
00:18:57,065 --> 00:18:59,839
I've been ordered
to bring everyone in.

216
00:19:00,851 --> 00:19:02,620
- Ethan.
- I understand.

217
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:05,008
- Ethan.
- I understand, Brandt.

218
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:06,994
We didn't have this conversation.

219
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:10,155
I disappeared in London.
You don't know where I am.

220
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,743
If I'm dead or alive.

221
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:14,295
This man you saw.
Can you find him?

222
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:18,394
I won't stop until I do.

223
00:19:18,768 --> 00:19:21,787
This may very well be
our last mission, Ethan.

224
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:23,447
Make it count.

225
00:19:23,472 --> 00:19:25,165
Brandt.

226
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:45,687
Since we are going
to be work together,

227
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:48,370
I want you to choose your
next works very carefully.

228
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,512
Where is Hunt?

229
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:51,462
- I don't know.
- Don't lie to me, Brandt.

230
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:53,243
I have no way of contacting him.

231
00:19:53,268 --> 00:19:56,073
He's deep cover. Last I heard,
he's tracking the Syndicate.

232
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:57,405
Let's cut the bull.

233
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,452
You know who we are.
You know what we are capable of.

234
00:20:00,477 --> 00:20:05,290
How come the CIA has never discovered
any actual Intel regarding this Syndicate.

235
00:20:05,315 --> 00:20:07,971
- What are you implying?
- Not implying, stating.

236
00:20:07,996 --> 00:20:10,259
Leveling an accusation actually.

237
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:13,870
Hunt is both arsonist and fireman
at the same time.

238
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:16,502
I believe that the Syndicate
is a figment of his imagination.

239
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:19,809
Created to justify
the IMF's existence.

240
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:22,183
I'm going to find him, Brandt.
And when I do,

241
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:28,600
he will be called upon to answer for every
wanton active mayhem he's responsible for.

242
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:32,640
Welcome to the CIA.

243
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:35,611
You'll never find him.

244
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:37,481
Set your watch, Brandt.

245
00:20:37,506 --> 00:20:40,998
Ethan Hunt is living his
last day as a free man.

246
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:44,044
6 months later

247
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:47,133
HAVANA,
CUBA

248
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,851
CIA
LANGLEY, VIRGINIA

249
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:57,015
All right, everybody.
Heads up.

250
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,713
This is it.

251
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,142
Alpha team prep.
Standing by.

252
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,181
- Execute.
- Langley brimstone, go.

253
00:21:03,206 --> 00:21:05,419
I say again.
We are a go.

254
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:04,035
Langley, there's nobody here.

255
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,978
Langley brimstone.
Face the north wall.

256
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:26,367
ANOTHER ONE VANISHES
HERE IS FLIGHT 606?

257
00:22:26,392 --> 00:22:28,381
FIRE GUTS CHEMICAL
WEAPONS PLANT

258
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:31,670
WORLD BANK
DECLARES CRISIS

259
00:23:05,942 --> 00:23:07,942
B. Dunn

260
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,354
VIENNA OPERA

261
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:16,322
YOU'VE
WON!

262
00:23:20,836 --> 00:23:22,363
Dunn.

263
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:26,511
Is it that time already.
Okay.

264
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:30,197
I'm going to ask you
a series of control questions.

265
00:23:30,222 --> 00:23:31,895
I know and I'm gonna
answer truthfully.

266
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,456
And then you gonna ask
me to lie intentionally.

267
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:37,442
- State your name.
- The King of Norway.

268
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:39,432
See, that's a lie.

269
00:23:39,457 --> 00:23:41,225
I'm actually third in line
to the throne.

270
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,887
My brother was...

271
00:23:42,912 --> 00:23:45,387
- Has Ethan Hunt contacted you?
- Why would he contact me?

272
00:23:45,412 --> 00:23:48,248
Hunt has resurfaced.
This time in Cuba.

273
00:23:48,273 --> 00:23:52,229
He...
left these behind.

274
00:23:52,504 --> 00:23:54,636
Tell me what you
make of them.

275
00:23:54,938 --> 00:23:56,639
I don't know.
He's taken up scrap booking?

276
00:23:56,664 --> 00:23:58,542
Look at the photographs, Dunn.

277
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:01,432
All of them are either
missing or dead, everyone.

278
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:03,055
All of them were
government agents.

279
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,096
Russian, French, British, Israelis,
you name it.

280
00:24:06,121 --> 00:24:09,386
These are highly classified files and yet
Hunt had no problem collecting them.

281
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:12,459
And he always seems
to be a step ahead of us.

282
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,846
- I wonder how?
- Are you suggesting I'm helping him?

283
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:17,070
That thought had cross my mind.

284
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:18,792
6 months, I have been here.

285
00:24:18,823 --> 00:24:22,846
Sifting through mountains of metadata
and exabytes of encoded excrement.

286
00:24:22,871 --> 00:24:26,922
I had decrypted, processed, passed
more data than anyone in my section.

287
00:24:26,947 --> 00:24:28,888
And yet every week,
you hold me in here.

288
00:24:28,913 --> 00:24:31,866
And you ask me the same question,
just in a different way.

289
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:35,414
And today,
you haven't answered it.

290
00:24:37,148 --> 00:24:41,019
You seem to thinks I have
some kind of obligation to him.

291
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:43,639
Okay, nothing could be
further from the truth.

292
00:24:43,664 --> 00:24:50,376
Ethan Hunt is still out there in the field,
and I'm stuck here answering for it

293
00:24:50,478 --> 00:24:52,867
We're not friends.

294
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:56,846
I owe him nothing.

295
00:25:01,397 --> 00:25:03,922
That'll be all, Dunn.

296
00:26:01,987 --> 00:26:04,495
Welcome to Vienna, Benji.
Missed me?

297
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,589
Ethan, where are you?
Where the hell have you been?

298
00:26:06,614 --> 00:26:08,778
No act.. you know what? Please,
don't tell me that,

299
00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:11,769
because it's just another thing I would have
to lie about in my weekly polygraph.

300
00:26:11,794 --> 00:26:13,991
Everything is going to be fine.
Just keep walking.

301
00:26:14,016 --> 00:26:16,355
But, make sure you're
not being follow.ed

302
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,594
- Oh. I didn't win those opera tickets, did I?
- No, I'm afraid not

303
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,293
- So, where do we meet?
- We don't.

304
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:24,167
For your sake,
we shouldn't be seen together.

305
00:26:24,192 --> 00:26:25,783
You have mail.

306
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:28,743
- Who is he?
- That's what we're here to find out.

307
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,916
What I do know, is he's our only
possible link to the Syndicate

308
00:26:32,518 --> 00:26:34,915
and I have reason to believe that
he's going to be here tonight.

309
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,131
But I can't find him alone.
Are you in?

310
00:26:38,156 --> 00:26:41,486
- Are you in?
- Yes, of course. Of course.

311
00:26:41,511 --> 00:26:44,978
- So, what's the play?
- Simple. You find him, we tag him.

312
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,902
- I follow him wherever he goes.
- And after that?

313
00:26:47,927 --> 00:26:50,985
After that you're on a plane,
back at work Monday morning.

314
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,321
- No one is the wiser.
- What? That's it?

315
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,916
You're in enough
danger as it is.

316
00:26:55,941 --> 00:26:58,533
I didn't want to involve you
this much but I had no choice.

317
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:00,351
Whoa. If you're gonna bring me
all this way,

318
00:27:00,376 --> 00:27:03,951
 you could at least give me something
a little be more...you know, dramatic.

319
00:27:03,976 --> 00:27:06,957
Benji, we are trying
to keep a low profile.

320
00:27:06,982 --> 00:27:10,640
You want drama, go to the opera.

321
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:42,285
- Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- Yes, I am.

322
00:27:48,346 --> 00:27:51,635
Am I correct in assuming that is
the Chancellor of Austria?

323
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,162
- Yes, you are.
- Did you know he's going to be here?

324
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:56,846
- No
- Right.

325
00:27:56,871 --> 00:27:59,194
Well. We have a European
Heads of State here,

326
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,731
at the same time as we're
looking for a nefarious terrorist.

327
00:28:02,756 --> 00:28:06,294
- And I'm sure the two things
are completely unrelated.
- Benji.

328
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:11,244
- Mean while I'll try and overlook the fact that
you're an international fugitive wanted by the CIA.
- Benji.

329
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:14,828
- And this little unsanctioned operation
is tenement-ed treasonous.
- Benji.

330
00:28:14,853 --> 00:28:16,173
Because as you stated earlier,

331
00:28:16,198 --> 00:28:18,011
I will be back in my desk
on Monday morning,

332
00:28:18,036 --> 00:28:20,931
playing video games and no one
will be any be the wiser.

333
00:28:20,956 --> 00:28:22,682
- The show's about to start, Benji.
- Right.

334
00:28:22,707 --> 00:28:25,548
- Just take your position,
tell me what you see.
- Okay.

335
00:28:25,573 --> 00:28:27,878
Nice tux, by the way.

336
00:28:46,415 --> 00:28:48,781
Stage is set.
Ready lights.

337
00:28:48,806 --> 00:28:50,990
Ready lights.

338
00:28:57,459 --> 00:29:00,216
The final preparations ready.

339
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:02,491
Stay alert, please.

340
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:40,725
Join the IMF. See the world,
on a monitor

341
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,551
in a closet.

342
00:30:24,146 --> 00:30:26,549
Okay, I have eyes.

343
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,335
Searching

344
00:31:29,816 --> 00:31:33,399
- Talk to me, Benji.
- Nothing yet. Standby.

345
00:31:34,543 --> 00:31:39,450
I know you're here.
Where're you.

346
00:31:44,504 --> 00:31:47,161
Uh Ethan, I might have something for you.
Can't confirm.

347
00:31:47,186 --> 00:31:50,014
- Where?
- Backstage, I will direct you

348
00:31:56,977 --> 00:32:01,337
Take the door on your left.
He should be right in front of you.

349
00:32:42,089 --> 00:32:45,072
Benji, did you see that?
- See what?

350
00:32:45,689 --> 00:32:46,782
A woman.

351
00:32:46,807 --> 00:32:48,559
What woman?
Where're you?

352
00:32:48,584 --> 00:32:50,464
I can't see you.

353
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:11,323
- What happened?
- I don't know

354
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,191
Ethan, do you copy?
Ethan, come in.

355
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,721
Ethan, the lighting booth.
Ethan, do you copy?

356
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:53,242
Oh god.

357
00:39:18,979 --> 00:39:21,192
It's a flash wound.

358
00:39:55,801 --> 00:39:58,234
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

359
00:40:02,881 --> 00:40:06,517
Surround the building.
Secure the exits.

360
00:40:08,207 --> 00:40:12,088
I've a way out.
Interested?

361
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:14,930
Lead the way.

362
00:40:22,835 --> 00:40:26,213
- Anything you want to tell me?
- No, not right now.

363
00:40:26,238 --> 00:40:29,426
- How's the pace?
- Don't wait for me.

364
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:39,164
What's next?

365
00:40:40,491 --> 00:40:42,029
Alright.

366
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:43,918
There.

367
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:53,344
Shoes.

368
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:55,605
Shoes, please.

369
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:52,794
If anything happens to you...

370
00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:55,645
Nothing is going to happen to me.

371
00:41:56,033 --> 00:41:57,955
Stop the car!

372
00:42:05,843 --> 00:42:07,527
Get in.

373
00:42:09,132 --> 00:42:10,941
Go go go.

374
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:21,211
What the...!
She tried to shoot me.

375
00:42:21,236 --> 00:42:23,909
It doesn't make her
a bad person.

376
00:42:24,026 --> 00:42:26,654
- I'm gonna have to search you.
- You have to let me go.

377
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:28,198
Oh oh.
Not a chance.

378
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,858
I assume you're deep cover back in London
but isn't this taking the role a little too far.

379
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,060
Hang on a minute,
you know her?

380
00:42:33,085 --> 00:42:35,187
Oh.
We haven't formerly introduced.

381
00:42:35,212 --> 00:42:37,605
But I am pretty sure
she's British intelligence.

382
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:40,566
Ilsa Faust.
You're Ethan Hunt.

383
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:44,558
And... that shade is
very hard to find.

384
00:42:44,594 --> 00:42:47,741
- What were you doing at the opera tonight?
- What? Aside from killing the Chancellor.

385
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:51,923
Saving your life in London put me in a
tight spot with some very dangerous people.

386
00:42:51,948 --> 00:42:54,418
I was sent to kill the Chancellor
to regain their trust.

387
00:42:54,443 --> 00:42:56,135
Ha. So, you admit
that you killed him?

388
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,301
I went through the motion,
that's not the same thing.

389
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:02,367
You thought you put him in the hospital,
take him out of harm's way.

390
00:43:02,392 --> 00:43:04,081
The same thing
you tried to do.

391
00:43:04,106 --> 00:43:06,530
You're not gonna believe that, are you?
What about the rest of her team?

392
00:43:06,555 --> 00:43:10,407
You means those other 2 idiots?
I can only assumed they were redundancies.

393
00:43:10,432 --> 00:43:14,472
In case you didn't follow through.
One man to kill the Chancellor,

394
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,111
the other one to kill you.
A test.

395
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,093
Second one I failed,
thanks to you.

396
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:22,528
And the car bomb was insurance.

397
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,473
We have a tail.

398
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,620
Who is he?

399
00:43:31,645 --> 00:43:33,802
We're after the same thing,
and I can help you.

400
00:43:33,827 --> 00:43:36,720
If you want to bring down the Syndicate,
you've to let me out.

401
00:43:36,745 --> 00:43:38,750
They're closing.

402
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:42,256
This has to look like an escape.
So, you just throw me out anywhere.

403
00:43:42,281 --> 00:43:44,741
Tell me who he is.

404
00:43:44,766 --> 00:43:46,073
Oh!

405
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:49,705
Oh. Change of plan.
Throw her out!

406
00:43:51,386 --> 00:43:53,993
You have everything
you need to find me.

407
00:44:09,467 --> 00:44:13,453
Less than 24 hours after we interviewed
Benji Dunn about Ethan Hunt

408
00:44:13,478 --> 00:44:16,005
He was on a plane to Vienna
with tickets to the opera.

409
00:44:16,033 --> 00:44:19,305
And within 6 hours of his arrival,
the Chancellor was dead.

410
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:21,772
Now, that might be circumstance
to some public defendant.

411
00:44:21,797 --> 00:44:24,922
But to the CIA,
that is actionable intelligence.

412
00:44:24,923 --> 00:44:29,433
Consider the moment, the possibility that
Ethan's investigation lead him to the opera.

413
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,129
And he's the one with
the actionable intelligence.

414
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:35,274
In any case. Finding Hunt
is no longer our pet project.

415
00:44:35,314 --> 00:44:39,568
The Special Activity Division
will now have full discretion.

416
00:44:40,206 --> 00:44:41,605
You mean shoot to kill?

417
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:46,287
Whether Hunt lives or dies.
It's entirely up to him.

418
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,195
New identity, passport,
cash, road map.

419
00:45:49,228 --> 00:45:50,798
There's a change of clothes
in that bag, right there.

420
00:45:50,823 --> 00:45:53,678
Everything you need to
make it to DC undetected.

421
00:45:53,703 --> 00:45:56,461
Once you're there,
you'll have to inform on me.

422
00:45:56,486 --> 00:45:58,323
- I'm suppose... what? Sorry, what?
- Tell the truth.

423
00:45:58,324 --> 00:46:01,279
You came to Vienna believing
you won 2 tickets to the opera.

424
00:46:01,304 --> 00:46:04,658
And I attempted to recruit you into
assassinating the Chancellor, you refused.

425
00:46:04,683 --> 00:46:07,824
- That is not the true.
- Your life depends on them believing you, Benji.

426
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:10,261
It'll go easier if you tell them
what they want to hear.

427
00:46:10,286 --> 00:46:13,924
Ethan, at least tell me
what this is all about.

428
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:24,385
You recognized anyone?

429
00:46:36,587 --> 00:46:39,945
- Him.
- He's former KSA, German intelligence.

430
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:42,127
Missing, presumed dead.

431
00:46:42,475 --> 00:46:44,423
He was at the opera tonight.

432
00:46:44,448 --> 00:46:45,996
This one too.

433
00:46:46,021 --> 00:46:49,461
- Former Mossad.
- Let me guess. Presumed dead.

434
00:46:49,568 --> 00:46:52,025
Tonight, I made it official.

435
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:55,318
I was looking for him
in Bosporus.

436
00:46:55,343 --> 00:46:59,378
The same day a car accident
killed the visiting President of Malawi.

437
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:02,827
He slipped away again in Jakarta.

438
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,970
Hours before a passenger plane
vanished over the Pacific

439
00:47:05,995 --> 00:47:08,782
with 236 passengers.

440
00:47:09,417 --> 00:47:11,364
I just missed him
in the Philippines.

441
00:47:11,389 --> 00:47:16,487
Right before a fired petrochemical plant
gassed a village of 2,000 people.

442
00:47:18,261 --> 00:47:21,405
You're saying these accidents
are somehow connected.

443
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,424
That missing plane was carrying
the Secretary of the World Bank.

444
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,946
That fire bank corrupted
a global arms cooperation.

445
00:47:31,553 --> 00:47:34,454
That wreck triggered a civil war.

446
00:47:35,793 --> 00:47:38,027
These are no accidents.

447
00:47:38,127 --> 00:47:43,457
They're links in a chain. The work of
a single organization, the Syndicate.

448
00:47:43,597 --> 00:47:44,867
A rogue nation.

449
00:47:44,892 --> 00:47:47,996
Trained to do what we do.
Inbuilt with a new sense of purpose.

450
00:47:48,021 --> 00:47:50,350
Destroy the system that created them.

451
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:52,931
Regardless if who's in the way.

452
00:47:53,424 --> 00:47:55,756
An anti-IMF.

453
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:59,453
And since Hunley shut us down,
they've been escalating unchecked.

454
00:47:59,478 --> 00:48:02,179
Killing the Chancellor tonight
was a statement

455
00:48:02,203 --> 00:48:04,326
The start of a new phase.

456
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:08,727
Or they could just be
a series of random disasters.

457
00:48:09,635 --> 00:48:11,924
He was there.

458
00:48:12,134 --> 00:48:13,284
Everytime.

459
00:48:13,309 --> 00:48:16,421
Just like he was there tonight.
I'm sure of it.

460
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:20,098
I don't know who he is,
where he's from.

461
00:48:20,275 --> 00:48:22,238
How he's funded

462
00:48:22,263 --> 00:48:24,374
But I know he's the key.

463
00:48:24,399 --> 00:48:26,914
Ethan, this is what I sign up for.

464
00:48:26,939 --> 00:48:29,262
- Let me help you find him.
- That's why I brought you here.

465
00:48:29,287 --> 00:48:31,704
In the first place.
And look what happened.

466
00:48:31,729 --> 00:48:33,508
I can't protect you.

467
00:48:33,533 --> 00:48:35,489
That's why I need you to leave.

468
00:48:35,514 --> 00:48:38,744
It's not your decision
to make, Ethan.

469
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:40,355
I'm a field agent.

470
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,227
I know the risks.
More than that, I'm your friend.

471
00:48:43,252 --> 00:48:45,169
No matter what I... con
a polygraph every week.

472
00:48:45,194 --> 00:48:48,250
Now you called me because
you needed my help.

473
00:48:48,275 --> 00:48:51,482
And you still do.
So, I'm staying.

474
00:48:51,507 --> 00:48:54,229
And that's all we're
gonna say about that.

475
00:48:58,171 --> 00:49:01,635
- Okay
- Good

476
00:49:03,155 --> 00:49:05,139
Where do we start?

477
00:49:06,497 --> 00:49:08,145
Ilsa.

478
00:49:10,194 --> 00:49:12,838
Right.
And how do we find her?

479
00:49:12,863 --> 00:49:15,297
She said we've
everything we need.

480
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,909
We had an agreement.

481
00:49:56,934 --> 00:49:58,785
You send me to do
a job, I'd do it.

482
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:01,763
- But my way, not yours.
- When did I deviate?

483
00:50:01,788 --> 00:50:03,949
You put 2 more gunman
at the opera tonight.

484
00:50:03,974 --> 00:50:05,596
One of them try to kill me.

485
00:50:05,621 --> 00:50:06,739
You missed.

486
00:50:06,764 --> 00:50:09,361
I missed because Ethan Hunt
was there looking for you.

487
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:12,862
Ethan Hunt is in Vienna because
you allow him escape in London.

488
00:50:12,887 --> 00:50:17,020
Vinter would've kill him in London
and that's not what you asked for.

489
00:50:17,045 --> 00:50:19,870
Twice now
you've let him slipped away.

490
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,569
Curious.

491
00:50:22,594 --> 00:50:26,070
Are you questioning
my loyalty or my ability.

492
00:50:26,999 --> 00:50:29,207
- Can't decide.
- I've told you before.

493
00:50:29,232 --> 00:50:31,425
Trust me or kill me.

494
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:34,433
But If you're going to kill me,
be the man.

495
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,727
Do it yourself.

496
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:07,626
Did he say anything?

497
00:51:08,545 --> 00:51:13,389
- He knows about Morocco.
- What did he know about Morocco?

498
00:51:13,414 --> 00:51:17,778
He knows about the power plant.
He doesn't know what's in it.

499
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:21,268
Find him, please.

500
00:51:22,009 --> 00:51:23,898
He'll find me.

501
00:51:24,628 --> 00:51:26,910
I've him seen to that.

502
00:51:31,556 --> 00:51:33,664
- Well, that's interesting
- What is it?

503
00:51:33,689 --> 00:51:37,400
It's a SCIF. Secure Computer Facility
offline, ultra-contained.

504
00:51:37,425 --> 00:51:39,541
It's impossible to hack in
from the outside.

505
00:51:39,542 --> 00:51:42,086
It's essentially a digital
safety deposit box.

506
00:51:42,111 --> 00:51:45,778
Very strange thing for a young lady
to be carrying in her sundries.

507
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:50,164
- Where's it located?
- Morocco.

508
00:51:51,385 --> 00:51:53,239
Morocco.

509
00:51:54,767 --> 00:51:57,928
CASABLANCA
MOROCCO

510
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,246
Now, what brings you
gentlemen to Casablanca?

511
00:53:41,778 --> 00:53:45,959
- Good to see you
- What couldn't you tell me over the telephone?

512
00:53:47,129 --> 00:53:50,049
The Chancellor of Austria
was assassinated.

513
00:53:50,074 --> 00:53:52,960
We believe that Ethan
and Benji were there.

514
00:53:52,985 --> 00:53:56,604
Huntley's handed this over
to Special Activities Division.

515
00:53:57,008 --> 00:54:00,142
We need to find Ethan
before they do.

516
00:54:00,609 --> 00:54:02,911
That's where you come in.

517
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:07,361
- Not interested.
- Okay. Look, Luther.

518
00:54:07,386 --> 00:54:11,637
Look, man. I know Ethan.
I don't know you.

519
00:54:11,951 --> 00:54:14,937
All I know about you is that
you chose to work for Hunley.

520
00:54:14,963 --> 00:54:18,591
Yeah, all I know about you
is you chose to resign.

521
00:54:18,616 --> 00:54:21,337
You don't have to
worry about Ethan.

522
00:54:21,362 --> 00:54:24,416
- They'll never catch him
- No, they're not going to catch him. No.

523
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:26,812
This is the CIA, this is Hunley
we're talking about.

524
00:54:26,837 --> 00:54:30,320
Thing are out of control
And they're going to kill him.

525
00:54:30,815 --> 00:54:34,170
They're going to kill Ethan.
They're going to kill Benji.

526
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:38,021
We have to get to them first.
Are you going to help me?

527
00:54:44,461 --> 00:54:47,164
You need to understand something.

528
00:54:47,943 --> 00:54:50,484
Ethan is my friend

529
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:54,884
And if I have 1 second of doubt
whose side you're on.

530
00:54:57,624 --> 00:54:59,743
I believe you

531
00:55:00,688 --> 00:55:02,714
- Alright.
- Alright.

532
00:55:02,739 --> 00:55:06,163
- What do I have to go on?
- Not much.

533
00:55:06,188 --> 00:55:08,369
And not a lot of time.

534
00:55:09,834 --> 00:55:14,598
His name is Solomon Lane.
He created the Syndicate.

535
00:55:14,623 --> 00:55:16,614
Where does he come from?

536
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:19,876
He's former British intelligence.

537
00:55:20,163 --> 00:55:22,680
Well. If British intelligence
knows the Syndicate exist,

538
00:55:22,705 --> 00:55:24,889
why don't they
just tell the CIA?

539
00:55:24,914 --> 00:55:30,157
Because they don't want anyone knowing
the Syndicate was created by one of their own.

540
00:55:30,476 --> 00:55:33,308
I was sent undercover
to earn Lane's trust.

541
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:36,586
And eventually identifying
the members of his organization.

542
00:55:36,611 --> 00:55:39,120
For the first time in 2 years,

543
00:55:39,145 --> 00:55:41,607
I'm close to knowing
who they are.

544
00:55:41,632 --> 00:55:46,176
Lane had a ledger. It contain
the identities of his operatives,

545
00:55:46,201 --> 00:55:50,161
his terrorist associates, the entire
inner workings of the Syndicate.

546
00:55:50,186 --> 00:55:53,368
One of his agents stole it
hoping to blackmail him.

547
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:57,500
He kept it in a secure computer
facility for safe keeping.

548
00:55:57,525 --> 00:56:00,303
He died being interrogated
for the access code.

549
00:56:00,328 --> 00:56:03,264
Leaving Lane with a serious problem.

550
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:10,951
So the key to crushing Lane is sitting in a
computer just waiting for someone to take it?

551
00:56:11,197 --> 00:56:14,946
So why hasn't Lane just
send someone to steal it?

552
00:56:15,048 --> 00:56:19,497
Oh, he has.
He sent me.

553
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,515
And I can tell you.

554
00:56:22,401 --> 00:56:24,526
It's impossible.

555
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:31,469
The facility is hidden beneath the
local power plant under military guard.

556
00:56:31,494 --> 00:56:36,897
And the only way to download the ledger is through
the central computer terminal located there.

557
00:56:37,629 --> 00:56:41,164
To reach the terminal,
you'll need to pass the main gates.

558
00:56:41,653 --> 00:56:45,144
Access the elevator with fingerprint recognition

559
00:56:45,664 --> 00:56:49,050
And open 3 separate combination locks.

560
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:57,219
Well, that's easy. We just impersonate the
agent who stole the ledger in the first place.

561
00:56:57,244 --> 00:57:00,068
And.
I get to wear a mask.

562
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:26,288
Unfortunately, even if you can make
it through every other security measure

563
00:57:26,313 --> 00:57:30,126
you won't beat the last one.
That's because it's protected by gait analysis.

564
00:57:30,151 --> 00:57:32,373
A step beyond facial recognition.

565
00:57:32,398 --> 00:57:35,166
These cameras actually know
how the agent walks,

566
00:57:35,191 --> 00:57:39,618
how he talks, how he moves,
right down to his facial takes.

567
00:57:46,781 --> 00:57:48,781
So, what you're saying is,
no mask can beat it.

568
00:57:48,806 --> 00:57:50,250
We're busted before we could
even get into the vault.

569
00:57:50,275 --> 00:57:54,366
And I wind up in a Morocco jail playing
mommies and daddies without a mother strangler.

570
00:57:54,391 --> 00:57:56,473
Okay, I don't get
to wear a mask.

571
00:57:56,498 --> 00:57:59,443
- And there's no other way into the computer lab?
- No other way in.

572
00:57:59,468 --> 00:58:01,816
- Air Shaft?
- 6 inch diameter pipe.

573
00:58:01,841 --> 00:58:05,467
- Foundation?
- 12 feet of concrete, top and bottom.

574
00:58:05,492 --> 00:58:07,169
- Electrical conduit?
- Bottom line is,

575
00:58:07,194 --> 00:58:08,861
there's no way into
that terminal unless

576
00:58:08,886 --> 00:58:13,076
your profile is pre-installed
in the security system.

577
00:58:13,628 --> 00:58:15,267
Profile?

578
00:58:15,843 --> 00:58:17,355
Where're the profile stored?

579
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:21,482
All security data is stored
offline in the liquid cooler aid.

580
00:58:21,521 --> 00:58:24,584
Here, inside the torus,
liquid cooled.

581
00:58:24,609 --> 00:58:26,507
You mean that thing
is under water?

582
00:58:26,532 --> 00:58:28,685
- Yes.
- Yes.

583
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:29,790
Okay.

584
00:58:29,815 --> 00:58:34,149
So, to get the ledger, one of us
needs to enter the  torus

585
00:58:34,425 --> 00:58:37,311
and change the security profile.

586
00:58:38,413 --> 00:58:42,404
So that the other one can access
the computer without being caught.

587
00:58:43,678 --> 00:58:47,694
- That's the only way.
- That's the only way.

588
00:58:48,583 --> 00:58:49,819
Can I get in through there.

589
00:58:49,844 --> 00:58:52,068
- What's that?
- That's the service hatch.

590
00:58:52,093 --> 00:58:55,580
It can only be opened from the inside
If you try and open it from the outside,

591
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:59,026
you'll be hit with 70 thousand
gallons of pressurized water.

592
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:02,344
- Where does the water come from?
- Desalinized seawater flows through the intake.

593
00:59:02,369 --> 00:59:04,699
in the pipeline.
And before you ask.

594
00:59:04,724 --> 00:59:10,063
The system is designed to shut down
automatically if any metal enters the intake.

595
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,615
No oxygen tanks.

596
00:59:13,913 --> 00:59:18,360
Alright. Well, how long will it take to free swim
from the intake to the service hatch.

597
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:20,782
2 minutes.
With the current at full power.

598
00:59:20,806 --> 00:59:23,295
Well. Then, you just have to hold
your breath for 2 minutes.

599
00:59:23,321 --> 00:59:27,191
- What about installing the security profile?
- Well. That's gonna be like a minute tops.

600
00:59:27,216 --> 00:59:29,189
So, I have to hold my breath
for 3 minutes?

601
00:59:29,214 --> 00:59:30,373
You can do that.

602
00:59:30,398 --> 00:59:32,624
But I think you're overlooking,
is the physical exertion.

603
00:59:32,649 --> 00:59:35,760
The more you exert yourself,
the faster you consume oxygen.

604
00:59:35,785 --> 00:59:37,305
Don't worry about him.
Alright.

605
00:59:37,306 --> 00:59:40,999
All he has to do is install the fake profile
before I get to the gait analysis.

606
00:59:41,024 --> 00:59:43,415
You said it yourself,
it's the only way

607
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,046
That doesn't sound impossible.

608
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:51,891
Satellite over-watch
covering all 7 continents,

609
00:59:51,916 --> 00:59:56,135
DNA profiling, facial recognition,
drone surveillance, drone strikes.

610
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,977
So, how are we suppose to find
Ethan and Benji before they do?

611
00:59:59,002 --> 01:00:02,791
I'm not even looking for them.
I'm looking for her.

612
01:00:02,886 --> 01:00:04,663
What do you mean?

613
01:00:05,165 --> 01:00:08,789
These sketches,
what do you see?

614
01:00:09,968 --> 01:00:13,549
Ethan's not exactly sure
who this guys is.

615
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:18,177
But this woman,
he knows her.

616
01:00:18,202 --> 01:00:20,030
He trust her.

617
01:00:20,055 --> 01:00:22,709
I'm betting that if he's not
already with her, he's on his way.

618
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:24,232
Find her, find Ethan.

619
01:00:24,257 --> 01:00:26,702
Tell me it's possible to pull
facial recognition of a sketch.

620
01:00:26,727 --> 01:00:30,811
For mere mortals, no.
For me, I could've done this at home.

621
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:32,593
Alright.

622
01:00:36,539 --> 01:00:39,255
- How long is this going to take?
- Found her.

623
01:00:41,654 --> 01:00:46,075
CCTV picked her up
at the airport in Casablanca.

624
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:46,739
<font color="#ff8080">DISAVOWED</font>

625
01:00:46,764 --> 01:00:49,009
<font color="#ff8080">DISAVOWED</font>
- What the hell?

626
01:00:49,676 --> 01:00:52,137
She's bad news.

627
01:01:12,663 --> 01:01:16,035
- Card.
- Hello.

628
01:01:20,536 --> 01:01:22,161
Sorry

629
01:01:51,947 --> 01:01:55,368
- Your card is not working.
- Benji, we're in.

630
01:01:55,393 --> 01:01:57,062
<font color="#b0ffb0">Released</font>

631
01:01:59,335 --> 01:02:01,149
Thank you.

632
01:02:38,419 --> 01:02:41,589
One more time.
You have 3 minutes.

633
01:02:41,614 --> 01:02:44,746
2.5 minutes to switch
the security profile.

634
01:02:44,771 --> 01:02:47,883
30 seconds to escape
through the service hatch.

635
01:02:47,908 --> 01:02:52,748
Remember, conserve oxygen.
Don't move a muscle if you don't have to.

636
01:03:10,044 --> 01:03:12,276
I'm in the elevator.

637
01:03:22,821 --> 01:03:25,589
That current will
carry you to a torus.

638
01:03:25,614 --> 01:03:28,068
Once you're there,
I'll shut it down.

639
01:03:28,093 --> 01:03:31,906
Important note.
The profile is in slot 108.

640
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:33,965
And a slightly more
important note,

641
01:03:33,991 --> 01:03:36,915
if you haven't switched that profile
before I reach the gait analysis,

642
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:38,282
I'm dead.

643
01:03:38,307 --> 01:03:40,374
Thank you, Benji.

644
01:04:49,155 --> 01:04:52,767
- What's the problem?
- The cooling system is rebooting...

645
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:55,027
by itself.

646
01:06:03,868 --> 01:06:05,253
Oaf.

647
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:20,819
All systems' normal.

648
01:06:20,844 --> 01:06:23,639
All systems at full power.

649
01:06:26,908 --> 01:06:28,750
SERVICE HATCH
<font color="#ff8080">SECURE [o]</font>

650
01:06:28,775 --> 01:06:31,819
No-no-no...

651
01:08:02,634 --> 01:08:03,855
<font color="#b0ffb0">AUTHORISED</font>

652
01:09:57,935 --> 01:10:01,600
You're alright.
You're okay.

653
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:03,388
See.
What did I told you.

654
01:10:03,389 --> 01:10:06,984
Difficult, absolutely,
but certainly not impossible...

655
01:10:07,906 --> 01:10:11,637
Jesus, is he alright?
What happened? What happened?

656
01:10:23,242 --> 01:10:25,302
Okay.
Okay.

657
01:10:26,033 --> 01:10:27,516
Here.

658
01:10:28,847 --> 01:10:30,331
Hey.

659
01:10:30,356 --> 01:10:32,558
I misjudged you.

660
01:10:37,685 --> 01:10:40,195
Hey, man. Hey.
You okay? How're you doing?

661
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:41,781
Hey, buddy.

662
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:44,754
- Benji.
- Yes, it's Benji.

663
01:10:44,779 --> 01:10:46,345
You did good.

664
01:10:46,346 --> 01:10:48,349
You take a moment, alright.
Just-Just take a moment.

665
01:10:48,374 --> 01:10:50,795
There's nothing a little sunshine
and fresh air won't fix you.

666
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:53,728
- You'll be as right as rain.
- What are you doing here?

667
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:55,817
Look-look-look...

668
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:57,353
We got it.

669
01:10:57,354 --> 01:10:59,354
I knew we'll get it.

670
01:11:00,945 --> 01:11:02,603
Listen. I don't want to
sound ungrateful, okay.

671
01:11:02,628 --> 01:11:04,569
I appreciate everything
you do for me, but...

672
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:07,559
one of these days,
you're gonna take it too far.

673
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:10,754
We got it.

674
01:11:10,779 --> 01:11:13,126
We're gonna nail that...

675
01:11:21,788 --> 01:11:24,507
Wait.
Wait.

676
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:28,298
I thought you said
you can find him?

677
01:11:28,323 --> 01:11:31,326
I said I could locate him.
You've to find him.

678
01:11:31,351 --> 01:11:32,843
Right.

679
01:11:32,868 --> 01:11:35,007
<font color="#ff8080">SEARCHING
SEARCHING</font>

680
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:53,056
Where's Hunt?

681
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,422
He's dead.

682
01:12:00,447 --> 01:12:01,769
Oh.
That really hurts!

683
01:12:01,794 --> 01:12:03,219
- Can you walk?
- Yes, I can.

684
01:12:03,244 --> 01:12:06,823
We have to get to her
before Lane does.

685
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:58,047
Whoa-whoa-whoa...
Are you okay to drive?

686
01:12:58,072 --> 01:13:00,354
I mean. A minute ago
you were dead.

687
01:13:00,379 --> 01:13:02,546
What are you talking about?

688
01:13:02,571 --> 01:13:05,032
This is not gonna end well.

689
01:13:14,905 --> 01:13:16,742
There she is.

690
01:13:26,837 --> 01:13:29,341
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

691
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,847
Stairs, stairs, stairs!

692
01:13:32,999 --> 01:13:35,732
Ah!
God damn it.

693
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:07,465
Whoa.

694
01:14:15,926 --> 01:14:17,375
Hey?

695
01:14:19,189 --> 01:14:20,881
 I found them.

696
01:14:21,805 --> 01:14:24,002
Come on, man.

697
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:28,207
Shit.

698
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:30,250
It's a high-speed chase.

699
01:14:30,275 --> 01:14:32,557
You just had to get
the 4 by 4, didn't you?

700
01:14:32,582 --> 01:14:34,266
Hey, look. Don't blame me.
You chose the car.

701
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:36,176
- You just had to have it!
- Do you want me to drive?

702
01:14:36,201 --> 01:14:37,566
- Do you want me to drive?
- Look, it's a stick.

703
01:14:37,591 --> 01:14:40,617
Look at this. Look how slow
you're going. Speed it up.

704
01:14:44,959 --> 01:14:46,959
Who's this guy?

705
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:50,430
Shit!

706
01:15:08,816 --> 01:15:11,072
AWW!

707
01:15:16,467 --> 01:15:18,931
Go-go-go-
Go!

708
01:15:21,386 --> 01:15:24,190
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I'm okay.

709
01:15:28,474 --> 01:15:29,833
Ho!

710
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:32,840
Whoa-whoa-whoa...

711
01:15:40,047 --> 01:15:42,047
Here they come!

712
01:15:42,072 --> 01:15:44,075
What're we gonna do?

713
01:15:56,596 --> 01:15:58,433
Gun!

714
01:16:01,047 --> 01:16:02,598
 Do you have
your seat belts on?

715
01:16:02,623 --> 01:16:04,790
What?
You're asking me that now?

716
01:16:12,342 --> 01:16:14,534
- Hang on!
- Ah!

717
01:16:15,097 --> 01:16:16,695
Aww!

718
01:16:53,337 --> 01:16:55,122
Are you good?

719
01:16:55,147 --> 01:16:57,546
Things...
got a little out of hand.

720
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:59,971
Aw!
Look out!

721
01:17:04,303 --> 01:17:07,274
Okay.
We're good?

722
01:17:15,492 --> 01:17:17,890
Oh, hi boys.
What did I miss?

723
01:17:22,801 --> 01:17:25,791
Woo. That look sharp.
Careful, careful.

724
01:21:07,568 --> 01:21:09,921
So, what do we do now?

725
01:21:11,846 --> 01:21:15,638
Please tell me, you made
a copy of that disk..

726
01:21:17,332 --> 01:21:19,972
Of course I made a copy.

727
01:21:27,354 --> 01:21:29,354
So where are we going?

728
01:21:53,287 --> 01:21:54,491
It's a ledger.

729
01:21:54,516 --> 01:21:56,707
The Syndicate's entire infrastructure.

730
01:21:56,732 --> 01:22:00,040
Who they are, the politicians they control,
and where the money comes from.

731
01:22:00,549 --> 01:22:02,704
It's everything you want to know.

732
01:22:02,737 --> 01:22:06,874
What makes you think this
so-called ledger is authentic?

733
01:22:06,899 --> 01:22:09,514
Why would Lane want it so badly
if it wasn't authentic?

734
01:22:09,539 --> 01:22:12,066
Why would he ever
let you have it if it was?

735
01:22:12,091 --> 01:22:15,391
Did you never stop to consider
he may want me to have it?

736
01:22:15,416 --> 01:22:16,958
Misinformation, manipulation.

737
01:22:16,983 --> 01:22:19,605
What he does exercise,
what he's trained to do.

738
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:22,909
Lane lies to you,
you sell his lies to Hunt.

739
01:22:22,934 --> 01:22:24,603
Together, you both are compromised.

740
01:22:24,628 --> 01:22:27,012
That's his ultimate objective.

741
01:22:27,037 --> 01:22:28,915
This may be authentic.

742
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:34,194
But there's only one person I trust
to verify that information. You.

743
01:22:35,668 --> 01:22:37,136
No.

744
01:22:38,443 --> 01:22:41,207
My orders were to deliver you
information regarding the Syndicate.

745
01:22:41,232 --> 01:22:46,487
Your orders were to infiltrate the Syndicate
that we may learn more about them first hand.

746
01:22:46,512 --> 01:22:48,781
This isn't prove, it's a test,
like everything else.

747
01:22:48,806 --> 01:22:51,336
The only way to pass,
is to go back.

748
01:22:51,361 --> 01:22:52,815
I can't do that.

749
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:55,546
I betrayed Lane's trust
too many times.

750
01:22:55,571 --> 01:22:57,880
And in every instance, you
did so on you own volition.

751
01:22:57,905 --> 01:23:00,641
He was going to tortured
and killed an American agent.

752
01:23:00,666 --> 01:23:04,155
And you should've let him, and
you would still have Lane's trust.

753
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:06,281
This is the trade,
Hunt understands that.

754
01:23:06,306 --> 01:23:08,846
I wasn't going to let him die.
He is our ally.

755
01:23:08,871 --> 01:23:13,424
There are no allies in state craft,
Ilsa. Only common interest.

756
01:23:13,449 --> 01:23:17,143
As it stands, Ethan Hunt
is a man without a country.

757
01:23:17,168 --> 01:23:21,876
This makes killing him
decidedly less complicated.

758
01:23:23,038 --> 01:23:24,896
Are you ordering
me to kill Hunt?

759
01:23:24,921 --> 01:23:27,928
Good god, no.
Nothing so crude as that, no.

760
01:23:28,638 --> 01:23:30,811
Lane will order you.

761
01:23:30,836 --> 01:23:36,010
And to regain his trust,
you will do it.

762
01:23:36,496 --> 01:23:39,677
You sent me
to do a job.

763
01:23:39,702 --> 01:23:41,595
I did it.

764
01:23:41,751 --> 01:23:43,783
Now, you bring me in.

765
01:23:43,807 --> 01:23:48,017
Might I remind you, you're
without a country of your own.

766
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,309
The director of the CIA called me
inquiring about you personally.

767
01:23:51,334 --> 01:23:53,887
Of course to protect your cover,
I had to lie.

768
01:23:53,912 --> 01:23:55,390
So, as far as the
Americans are concern,

769
01:23:55,415 --> 01:23:59,264
you're a rogue assassin,
a target of opportunity.

770
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,740
A precious few people
know about your true identity.

771
01:24:02,765 --> 01:24:08,111
It would be unfortunate
if we forgot.

772
01:24:08,445 --> 01:24:11,470
You see, there really
is no choice ,Ilsa.

773
01:24:11,495 --> 01:24:13,789
You're going back.

774
01:24:20,844 --> 01:24:24,258
Glad to know
you're still with us.

775
01:24:32,073 --> 01:24:33,353
What?
What's happening?

776
01:24:33,354 --> 01:24:34,811
I can't open it.

777
01:24:34,812 --> 01:24:36,029
What do you mean
you can't open it?

778
01:24:36,054 --> 01:24:38,299
I mean
I can't open it, ever.

779
01:24:38,324 --> 01:24:40,112
That's a red box.

780
01:24:40,137 --> 01:24:42,003
- A what?
- It's a red box.

781
01:24:42,028 --> 01:24:44,950
The British government uses it
to transport national secrets.

782
01:24:44,975 --> 01:24:46,024
Doesn't sound good.

783
01:24:46,049 --> 01:24:48,545
Meaning it's triple encrypted.
You don't get into that thing

784
01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:54,024
unless you have fingerprints, retinal scan, and
a voice phrase spoken by a specific individual.

785
01:24:54,049 --> 01:24:56,454
The Prime Minister
of Great Britain himself.

786
01:24:56,479 --> 01:24:57,662
Yes, him.

787
01:24:57,687 --> 01:24:59,747
So, what you're saying is,
there is no ledger.

788
01:24:59,748 --> 01:25:02,258
which means we have no proof
that the Syndicate even exist.

789
01:25:02,283 --> 01:25:03,741
So, we're back to square one.

790
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:06,331
Only now, we're all
wanted by the CIA.

791
01:25:06,356 --> 01:25:08,273
I'm so proud of us.

792
01:25:08,298 --> 01:25:13,801
What I don't understand is why is there a
red box sat in a private data vault in Morocco.

793
01:25:13,826 --> 01:25:16,155
And why would Lane want it
if he can't open it?

794
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:19,506
If Lane wants it, you can bet
that he has a plan to open it.

795
01:25:20,687 --> 01:25:23,337
And we just
help him steal it.

796
01:25:26,497 --> 01:25:28,558
He's going to take
the Prime Minister.

797
01:25:28,573 --> 01:25:30,358
Yes, he is.

798
01:25:30,547 --> 01:25:31,738
The question is how?

799
01:25:31,763 --> 01:25:33,342
Well, we have to warn
the British government.

800
01:25:33,367 --> 01:25:35,369
- Yeah, MI6.
- No, no, Brandt.

801
01:25:35,394 --> 01:25:37,094
Put down the phone.
Let's think about this.

802
01:25:37,119 --> 01:25:39,595
We have a responsibility to
warn the British government,

803
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:42,105
and not gamble with
the Prime Minister's life.

804
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:44,905
Ethan, just so you
can beat the guy

805
01:25:44,930 --> 01:25:48,171
that's beaten you at every turn.

806
01:25:49,647 --> 01:25:51,887
Is that what
you think this is?

807
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:53,528
Brandt?

808
01:25:55,793 --> 01:25:58,320
Is that what
you think this is?

809
01:25:58,745 --> 01:26:00,041
I think right now,

810
01:26:00,066 --> 01:26:02,173
you're incapable of seeing
that there's another way.

811
01:26:02,198 --> 01:26:05,701
And sometimes Ethan is the only one
capable of seeing the only way.

812
01:26:05,726 --> 01:26:08,363
And if he's wrong,
then we have Vienna

813
01:26:08,388 --> 01:26:09,478
all over again.

814
01:26:09,503 --> 01:26:12,235
No, you don't know him.
If he wants something to happen,

815
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:13,637
there's no preventing it.

816
01:26:13,662 --> 01:26:15,673
That's why we have to
warn the British.

817
01:26:15,698 --> 01:26:18,078
Maybe that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

818
01:26:18,103 --> 01:26:20,310
Are you listening to yourself?
We're going to  warn the British.

819
01:26:20,335 --> 01:26:22,916
No. We're going to find Lane,
we're going to get him.

820
01:26:22,941 --> 01:26:25,533
Before he takes the Prime Minister.

821
01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:31,617
Okay.

822
01:26:31,642 --> 01:26:34,556
Alright, Ethan.
We're going to find Lane.

823
01:26:34,581 --> 01:26:36,487
But please tell me.

824
01:26:36,488 --> 01:26:38,819
How're we going to do that?

825
01:27:17,527 --> 01:27:19,194
All is forgiven.

826
01:27:19,219 --> 01:27:21,323
That isn't a ledger, is it?

827
01:27:21,348 --> 01:27:23,633
You didn't take
a look for yourself?

828
01:27:23,658 --> 01:27:25,083
Of course I did.

829
01:27:25,084 --> 01:27:26,842
But the file was encrypted.

830
01:27:26,843 --> 01:27:28,368
And why would I lie to you?

831
01:27:28,393 --> 01:27:30,689
So that I would
lie to Hunt.

832
01:27:31,949 --> 01:27:35,431
But he wouldn't have stolen it
if he knew what it was.

833
01:27:36,077 --> 01:27:38,369
And she wouldn't have helped him.

834
01:27:39,747 --> 01:27:41,827
What is actually on that disk?

835
01:27:41,852 --> 01:27:45,569
I'll be honest with you when
you start being honest with me.

836
01:27:46,322 --> 01:27:48,971
And you and I, we both know
why you come back.

837
01:27:48,996 --> 01:27:50,843
Don't we?

838
01:27:52,974 --> 01:27:56,006
You're still alive because
I believe in your potential.

839
01:27:56,031 --> 01:27:58,538
But I'm growing impatient.

840
01:27:59,343 --> 01:28:02,483
Why do you continue to resist?

841
01:28:05,843 --> 01:28:07,871
Well, if we're being honest,

842
01:28:08,504 --> 01:28:09,957
You're a terrorist.

843
01:28:09,982 --> 01:28:13,840
If that were true then my goal
would be to spread fear, but my...

844
01:28:13,865 --> 01:28:17,866
method is...
far more surgical.

845
01:28:19,038 --> 01:28:21,014
You kill innocent people.

846
01:28:21,039 --> 01:28:26,067
I helped my government killed many
innocent people and more, so much more.

847
01:28:26,676 --> 01:28:29,669
Killing to keep things as they were.

848
01:28:29,694 --> 01:28:33,559
And now I'm killing
to bring about change.

849
01:28:33,771 --> 01:28:36,460
I think Ethan Hunt would disagree.

850
01:28:36,485 --> 01:28:38,668
Ethan Hunt is a gambler.

851
01:28:38,693 --> 01:28:40,935
And one day
his luck will run out,

852
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,653
And thousands of innocent people
will pay the price.

853
01:28:44,678 --> 01:28:47,788
Which one of us
will be the villain then?

854
01:28:50,736 --> 01:28:53,686
Nothing here.
It's empty.

855
01:29:09,656 --> 01:29:11,083
I'm interested

856
01:29:11,108 --> 01:29:13,667
to see who you blame

857
01:29:14,646 --> 01:29:17,244
for what happens next.

858
01:30:03,915 --> 01:30:05,387
So, that's her?

859
01:30:05,388 --> 01:30:07,494
That's her.

860
01:30:10,211 --> 01:30:12,211
I have to say

861
01:30:13,126 --> 01:30:15,324
you sure can ride.

862
01:30:17,566 --> 01:30:20,297
- Ethan.
- You're just doing your job.

863
01:30:21,184 --> 01:30:23,662
That's all I'm going to
say about it.

864
01:30:24,910 --> 01:30:26,721
Atlee said you'd understand.

865
01:30:26,746 --> 01:30:30,525
Atlee, your handler
in British Intelligence.

866
01:30:33,283 --> 01:30:35,607
And he didn't bring you in?

867
01:30:37,041 --> 01:30:39,663
Even after you
gave him the disk?

868
01:30:39,688 --> 01:30:42,799
You knew perfectly well
it was blank.

869
01:30:42,824 --> 01:30:46,550
That's a lie. The disk she took from me
was an exact copy. I'm of it.

870
01:30:46,575 --> 01:30:49,660
Was it in your possession
the entire time?

871
01:30:54,418 --> 01:30:55,522
<font color="#e4adc0">DELETING FILES</font>

872
01:30:55,547 --> 01:30:56,810
<font color="#e4adc0">FILES DELETED</font>

873
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,234
Oh.

874
01:31:01,287 --> 01:31:04,607
They don't care
if you live or die.

875
01:31:11,314 --> 01:31:14,394
But you knew I was
going to take it to him.

876
01:31:14,419 --> 01:31:15,953
I hope you would.

877
01:31:15,978 --> 01:31:18,687
I hope it would be
enough to get you out.

878
01:31:18,972 --> 01:31:22,049
Whoa-whoa-whoa. That means Lane
doesn't have the disk, only we do.

879
01:31:22,074 --> 01:31:25,154
I have a question.
If the disk was blank,

880
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:27,337
why is she still alive?

881
01:31:27,362 --> 01:31:29,251
Unless, of course,

882
01:31:29,252 --> 01:31:31,659
Lane wanted us to find her.

883
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:35,334
So, who're you
working for now?

884
01:31:35,628 --> 01:31:39,701
Lane, Atlee, your government,
my government, they're all the same

885
01:31:39,974 --> 01:31:44,442
We only think we're fighting for the right side
because that's what we choose to believe.

886
01:31:45,356 --> 01:31:47,341
So what does that leave us?

887
01:31:47,342 --> 01:31:50,123
The way I see it,
you have 3 choices.

888
01:31:50,152 --> 01:31:53,878
One, you hand me and
the disk over to the CIA.

889
01:31:53,903 --> 01:31:55,718
I'm proof that Syndicate exist.

890
01:31:55,743 --> 01:31:59,244
Lane becomes their problem,
and... your work is done.

891
01:31:59,269 --> 01:32:01,779
- My thoughts exactly.
- Works for me.

892
01:32:01,804 --> 01:32:03,876
But you know they're
not going to believe you.

893
01:32:03,901 --> 01:32:06,713
And you all will be
trialed for treason.

894
01:32:06,738 --> 01:32:08,215
Lane goes free.

895
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:10,148
I'm afraid
she's has a point.

896
01:32:10,149 --> 01:32:14,226
Two, you let me walk away
to an uncertain fate.

897
01:32:14,251 --> 01:32:17,915
You use the disk
as bait to trap Lane.

898
01:32:18,209 --> 01:32:20,992
But some part of you suspect
you've met your match.

899
01:32:21,017 --> 01:32:23,711
And being a gambler, you'll probably
end up handing Lane that disk

900
01:32:23,736 --> 01:32:26,020
whether you want to or not.

901
01:32:26,045 --> 01:32:28,292
That is entirely possible.

902
01:32:28,317 --> 01:32:30,317
And option three?

903
01:32:30,382 --> 01:32:32,643
Come away with me.

904
01:32:33,570 --> 01:32:35,654
Right now.

905
01:32:38,051 --> 01:32:40,548
Oh boy.

906
01:32:43,525 --> 01:32:45,298
And what about Lane?

907
01:32:45,299 --> 01:32:47,449
Forget about Lane.

908
01:32:47,474 --> 01:32:49,937
There will always be another Lane.

909
01:32:49,962 --> 01:32:53,307
There will always be
people like us to face him.

910
01:32:53,682 --> 01:32:57,195
We've done our part
and we've been cast aside.

911
01:32:57,708 --> 01:33:00,316
We can be anyone.

912
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:02,911
We can do anything.

913
01:33:04,262 --> 01:33:06,755
It's only a matter of going.

914
01:33:19,629 --> 01:33:22,923
Lane sent you to deliver
a message, didn't he?

915
01:33:23,254 --> 01:33:26,201
I saved you life twice.
I won't be able to do it again.

916
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:28,379
What's the message?

917
01:33:40,819 --> 01:33:42,545
Benji.

918
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:56,062
Parking garage

919
01:33:56,087 --> 01:33:58,279
Luther, stay with her.

920
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:23,127
She's gone.

921
01:34:23,152 --> 01:34:25,152
I lost her.

922
01:34:27,672 --> 01:34:30,051
She set us up, Ethan.

923
01:34:30,076 --> 01:34:31,938
No, she delivered a message.

924
01:34:31,963 --> 01:34:33,565
She set us up!

925
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:34,841
She knew this would happen.

926
01:34:34,866 --> 01:34:38,722
Only Lane knows
what's going to happen.

927
01:34:43,702 --> 01:34:45,536
I have a job for you, Ethan.

928
01:34:45,561 --> 01:34:48,318
And for the sake of your friend,
you will do it.

929
01:34:48,343 --> 01:34:49,477
I'm listening.

930
01:34:49,502 --> 01:34:52,426
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

931
01:34:52,451 --> 01:34:56,058
Is to bring me the unlocked disk
by midnight today.

932
01:34:56,083 --> 01:34:58,704
Now say the words, please.

933
01:34:59,086 --> 01:35:01,086
I accept.

934
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:03,257
Yes.

935
01:35:05,739 --> 01:35:07,739
I knew you would.

936
01:35:14,377 --> 01:35:19,429
He wants the disk, unlocked,
by midnight tonight

937
01:35:19,454 --> 01:35:24,971
Ethan, there's only one person
on earth who can unlock that disk.

938
01:35:25,231 --> 01:35:28,017
We have to take
the Prime Minister.

939
01:35:28,507 --> 01:35:31,437
Let's just think about
that for a minute.

940
01:35:32,487 --> 01:35:34,756
That's the only way
to get Benji back.

941
01:35:34,781 --> 01:35:38,299
Ethan, that's exactly what
Lane wants you to do.

942
01:35:38,324 --> 01:35:41,967
Which is why
it has to happen.

943
01:35:45,844 --> 01:35:48,351
This is how we beat Lane.

944
01:35:48,615 --> 01:35:50,898
This is how we make
everything right.

945
01:35:50,923 --> 01:35:55,190
Can you see?
Can you see it?

946
01:36:08,478 --> 01:36:12,888
William Brandt, sir.
He says it's urgent.

947
01:36:16,885 --> 01:36:18,961
I had a feeling you'd come
to your senses, Brandt.

948
01:36:18,992 --> 01:36:21,494
I'm only calling you because
I've no other choice.

949
01:36:21,519 --> 01:36:23,377
I'm trying to prevent
a catastrophe.

950
01:36:23,402 --> 01:36:26,336
I can understand that.
Where are you?

951
01:36:27,461 --> 01:36:30,947
- London
- Reroute us to London, now.

952
01:36:30,972 --> 01:36:33,712
- Where in London?
- I'll tell you when you land, not before.

953
01:36:33,737 --> 01:36:35,701
I'm not interested
in playing games, Brandt.

954
01:36:35,726 --> 01:36:38,830
And I'm not interested in seeing
my friends get killed either.

955
01:36:38,855 --> 01:36:41,376
So if I'm going to betray them,
we're going to do this in my terms

956
01:36:41,401 --> 01:36:43,344
and my terms only.
Do you understand?

957
01:36:43,369 --> 01:36:46,338
Keep your phone on,
instruction will follow.

958
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:55,600
- Should have been gone by now.
- Yeah.

959
01:36:57,987 --> 01:37:00,654
- You okay?
- Yeah.

960
01:37:02,711 --> 01:37:07,019
We're suppose to take down the
Prime Minister of Great Britain tonight.

961
01:37:07,373 --> 01:37:09,195
So...

962
01:37:10,277 --> 01:37:11,984
Brandt.

963
01:37:14,737 --> 01:37:17,762
I cant' see another way.

964
01:37:19,659 --> 01:37:21,808
Neither can I.

965
01:37:23,766 --> 01:37:27,081
What we do, we have to do
for our friends, right?

966
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:13,856
Get him ready, please.

967
01:38:38,428 --> 01:38:40,467
You're right to call me, Brandt.
Where is Hunt?

968
01:38:40,492 --> 01:38:42,440
He's on his way.
We don't have much time.

969
01:38:42,465 --> 01:38:45,212
- What does he intend to do?
- What matter is he's alive.

970
01:38:45,237 --> 01:38:49,558
And I need your reassurance
that it's going to stay that way.

971
01:39:04,406 --> 01:39:07,755
Have you informed the British Government
that Hunt has targeted the Prime Minister?

972
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:12,967
I will help you capture him... alive.
That is the deal.

973
01:39:18,540 --> 01:39:21,163
You picked up some terrible habits
from your friend, Brandt

974
01:39:21,188 --> 01:39:25,517
The worst of them being that you still
believe you can control any outcome.

975
01:39:25,542 --> 01:39:27,484
Stay with him.

976
01:39:31,056 --> 01:39:33,358
Chief Atlee.
Chief Atlee.

977
01:39:33,383 --> 01:39:35,741
Director Hunley, how
delightful to see you here.

978
01:39:35,766 --> 01:39:39,703
Last time we spoke, you were
hunting rogue agents in Morocco.

979
01:39:39,728 --> 01:39:44,336
Chief Atlee, I have reason to believe that
the Prime Minister's life is in danger.

980
01:39:46,812 --> 01:39:48,906
I'm listening.

981
01:39:51,402 --> 01:39:55,266
Any advance on 22,000?
Anyone?

982
01:39:55,291 --> 01:39:57,996
Going once.
Going twice.

983
01:39:58,021 --> 01:40:00,890
Sold!
To our generous Chairwoman.

984
01:40:00,925 --> 01:40:03,866
Sir. Chief Atlee from
MI6 needs to see you.

985
01:40:03,891 --> 01:40:06,180
He says it's urgent.

986
01:40:06,785 --> 01:40:08,747
Excuse me.

987
01:40:18,828 --> 01:40:23,479
- What's this all about?
- It's a matter of national security, Sir.

988
01:40:30,012 --> 01:40:34,755
- Under no circumstances is anyone to enter.
- Yes sir.

989
01:40:35,842 --> 01:40:38,174
Help me to understand.

990
01:40:38,199 --> 01:40:40,960
Who is this man?
Why is he after me?

991
01:40:40,985 --> 01:40:46,075
I'm afraid, Prime Minister, Director Hunley
and I share responsibility for this.

992
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:50,535
Ethan Hunt was part of a disgrace intelligence
agency which is since been dissolved.

993
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:55,873
And he's gone rogue, unfortunately intend on
dismantling  an imaginary terror network.

994
01:40:55,898 --> 01:41:00,097
Our new intelligence suggest that he's been
manipulated by one of your own former agent.

995
01:41:00,122 --> 01:41:03,210
Ilsa Faust, Prime Minister.
She disappeared 2 years ago.

996
01:41:03,235 --> 01:41:04,903
And if you don't mind I asking,

997
01:41:04,928 --> 01:41:07,229
what do I have to do with
this phantom network?

998
01:41:07,254 --> 01:41:10,185
Sir, this is William Brandt,
a former colleague of Hunt's.

999
01:41:10,210 --> 01:41:13,495
He came forward with first hand
knowledge of the plot against you.

1000
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:18,104
Sir. Hunt is in possession of a virtual
red box that can only be open by you.

1001
01:41:18,129 --> 01:41:22,200
He believes it is the key
to bring down the Syndicate.

1002
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:28,577
- The Syndicate, you say?
- Yes, Sir. That's what he calls it.

1003
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:30,824
Atlee.

1004
01:41:30,849 --> 01:41:36,060
He couldn't possibly be talking
about that "Syndicate"?

1005
01:41:37,586 --> 01:41:41,653
'Cause you assured me that,
that "Syndicate" was merely an exercise?

1006
01:41:41,678 --> 01:41:45,064
And it was, Prime Minister.
I can assure you.

1007
01:41:45,089 --> 01:41:48,261
And yet, here we have the Central
Intelligence Agency indicating otherwise.

1008
01:41:48,286 --> 01:41:51,912
- I don't understand.
- Prime Minister, your life is in danger.

1009
01:41:51,937 --> 01:41:55,350
I think our first priority is to
move you to a secure location.
- Sir.

1010
01:41:55,375 --> 01:41:59,673
Does the name Solomon Lane,
ring a bell?

1011
01:42:00,499 --> 01:42:07,119
Yes.
Unfortunately, it does.

1012
01:42:08,404 --> 01:42:11,366
So, there actually is
a Syndicate?

1013
01:42:11,391 --> 01:42:15,545
It was a hypothetical brainchild
of Chief Atlee.

1014
01:42:15,579 --> 01:42:19,891
Recruit former agents from other nations.
supply them with a new identity

1015
01:42:19,916 --> 01:42:24,442
and use them to surgically remove
our enemies, both at home and abroad.

1016
01:42:24,467 --> 01:42:30,375
It's operating budget was to be hidden offshore
in a virtual red box which I alone would control

1017
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:34,447
It would've made me judge, jury and
executioner with zero accountability.

1018
01:42:34,472 --> 01:42:37,113
I rejected the proposal unequivocally.

1019
01:42:37,138 --> 01:42:41,732
Furthermore, I was given every assurance
it never pass the planning stage.

1020
01:42:41,756 --> 01:42:44,619
Prime Minister,
there is no any Syndicate.

1021
01:42:44,644 --> 01:42:47,139
These people have been
duped by agent Faust.

1022
01:42:47,164 --> 01:42:50,731
Atlee.
Save it for the public inquiry.

1023
01:42:50,758 --> 01:42:52,231
Sir, I urge you not to
leave this room.

1024
01:42:52,256 --> 01:42:54,123
- Excuse me.
- Please.

1025
01:42:54,148 --> 01:42:56,622
Hunt is uniquely trained
and highly motivated.

1026
01:42:56,647 --> 01:42:59,892
A specialist without equal,
immune to any counter measures.

1027
01:42:59,917 --> 01:43:04,078
There is no secret he cannot extract.
No security he cannot breach.

1028
01:43:04,103 --> 01:43:06,638
No person he cannot become.

1029
01:43:06,663 --> 01:43:09,979
He has mostly likely anticipated
this very conversation

1030
01:43:10,004 --> 01:43:13,176
and is waiting to strike in
whatever direction we move.

1031
01:43:13,201 --> 01:43:17,247
Sir. Hunt is the living
manifestation of destiny.

1032
01:43:17,272 --> 01:43:21,305
And he has made you
his mission.

1033
01:43:21,582 --> 01:43:23,578
Prime Minister.

1034
01:43:39,361 --> 01:43:40,827
Hunt.

1035
01:43:40,852 --> 01:43:44,042
Sir, please step away
from the Prime Minister.

1036
01:43:47,117 --> 01:43:49,359
Just relax, Sir.
Everything is going to be alright.

1037
01:43:49,384 --> 01:43:53,098
- Atlee shot me
- Yes, he did, Sir.

1038
01:43:55,793 --> 01:44:01,398
Hunt, I hope you realize you set back
US, UK relations to the American revolution.

1039
01:44:01,423 --> 01:44:05,314
Desperate times,
desperate measures, sir.

1040
01:44:07,211 --> 01:44:09,037
- I'm here.
- Standby to receive.

1041
01:44:09,062 --> 01:44:10,689
Ready.

1042
01:44:16,297 --> 01:44:18,886
The Prime Minister's office
ask me to meet him here.

1043
01:44:18,911 --> 01:44:20,466
This way, sir

1044
01:44:20,491 --> 01:44:22,262
Scanning.

1045
01:44:25,449 --> 01:44:27,897
Retinal scan, confirm.

1046
01:44:30,483 --> 01:44:32,909
Some convenience, Sir.

1047
01:44:33,501 --> 01:44:36,585
You got a very warm hand.

1048
01:44:45,099 --> 01:44:47,536
Biometric, confirm.

1049
01:44:47,561 --> 01:44:51,427
- The prompt is "KIPLING".
- The prompt is "KIPLING".

1050
01:44:51,599 --> 01:44:55,705
Sir, I'm gonna need a pass phrase,
the prompt is "KIPLING".

1051
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:57,383
Yes, of course.

1052
01:44:57,408 --> 01:45:02,243
" If you can keep your
head when all about you.
Are losing theirs..."

1053
01:45:06,002 --> 01:45:10,373
"If you can trust yourself
when all men doubt you"

1054
01:45:14,088 --> 01:45:15,991
- You got it?
- I got it.

1055
01:45:16,016 --> 01:45:17,588
Oh man, do I got it.

1056
01:45:17,613 --> 01:45:21,807
- I'm here to see the Prime Minister.
- We were told not to let anybody in.

1057
01:45:21,832 --> 01:45:25,204
- By whom?
- By you, sir.

1058
01:45:28,319 --> 01:45:32,552
Hunley, what is this?
Security!

1059
01:45:38,711 --> 01:45:42,737
Chief Atlee. Kind of you
to accepted our invitation.

1060
01:45:42,766 --> 01:45:44,070
Ah.

1061
01:45:51,674 --> 01:45:54,686
Do you know who I am?

1062
01:45:56,017 --> 01:45:58,115
We know you
created the Syndicate.

1063
01:45:58,140 --> 01:46:00,971
But Lane went rogue and
turn it against you, didn't he?

1064
01:46:00,996 --> 01:46:03,459
And you've been desperately
trying to cover it up.

1065
01:46:03,484 --> 01:46:06,326
That's why you erased the disk
which she brought it to you.

1066
01:46:06,351 --> 01:46:09,014
That's true.

1067
01:46:10,668 --> 01:46:15,348
Now, Director Hunley has some questions
for you regarding Ilsa Faust.

1068
01:46:15,373 --> 01:46:17,841
Namely, how you frame her.

1069
01:46:17,866 --> 01:46:21,871
That's also true.

1070
01:46:25,106 --> 01:46:26,556
It's the antidote.

1071
01:46:26,581 --> 01:46:29,240
When the Prime Minister found
out about the Syndicate.

1072
01:46:29,265 --> 01:46:32,214
- Atlee had attacked him.
- Yes, that's true.

1073
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:36,707
- And then you saved the Prime Minister, sir.
- Did he?

1074
01:46:36,847 --> 01:46:39,310
I'm very grateful.

1075
01:46:49,485 --> 01:46:50,938
Sir.

1076
01:46:53,226 --> 01:46:56,816
You're cutting it very close, Ethan

1077
01:46:57,396 --> 01:47:00,839
I have what you want.
Where do I go?

1078
01:47:17,261 --> 01:47:19,264
Ethan, wait

1079
01:47:19,289 --> 01:47:21,529
If I'm not there in
15 minutes, he'll kill Benji.

1080
01:47:21,554 --> 01:47:23,400
Your mission is to bring
down the Syndicate.

1081
01:47:23,425 --> 01:47:27,695
If Lane gets his hands on that money,
we're unleashing a terrorist superpower.

1082
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:30,566
He'll never take me alive.
I'll make sure of it.

1083
01:47:30,591 --> 01:47:34,048
What happens, Ethan,
if you can't make it back?

1084
01:47:34,194 --> 01:47:36,473
I'll make it back.

1085
01:47:37,228 --> 01:47:39,140
Just be ready.

1086
01:47:43,473 --> 01:47:46,456
Greetings, Prime Minister.
If you are viewing this message,

1087
01:47:46,481 --> 01:47:49,368
it means that you have chosen
to activate the Syndicate.

1088
01:47:49,392 --> 01:47:54,755
This drive gives you access to 2.4 billion
pound sterling in untraceable currency.

1089
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:59,631
That will allow the Syndicate
to operate undetected for decades.

1090
01:47:59,656 --> 01:48:05,102
Instructions to access
these funds are as follows.

1091
01:49:10,689 --> 01:49:13,631
This is the end, Mr. Hunt.

1092
01:49:22,318 --> 01:49:23,983
Carefully.

1093
01:49:26,695 --> 01:49:32,516
2 pounds Semtex,
500, 30 caliber ball bearings.

1094
01:49:32,541 --> 01:49:36,265
Your friend is sitting on a
highly sensitive - pressure trigger.

1095
01:49:36,290 --> 01:49:39,086
So, no sudden moves.

1096
01:49:46,649 --> 01:49:47,970
Your final test.

1097
01:49:47,995 --> 01:49:52,526
When Lane has what he wants,
I kill you and Benji.

1098
01:49:52,748 --> 01:49:57,076
If not,
everyone dies.

1099
01:49:59,278 --> 01:50:03,521
No time to think, Ethan.
Have a seat, please.

1100
01:50:17,844 --> 01:50:21,611
Human nature,
my weapon of choice.

1101
01:50:21,636 --> 01:50:25,311
From the moment I killed the
young lady in the record shop,

1102
01:50:25,336 --> 01:50:28,739
I knew you would stop
at nothing to catch me.

1103
01:50:28,852 --> 01:50:31,530
I also knew Ilsa
wouldn't have a choice.

1104
01:50:31,555 --> 01:50:35,283
Whether she broke you that night
you met or let you go.

1105
01:50:35,308 --> 01:50:40,671
Whether you let her run in Morocco.
Whether she went to Atlee or not.

1106
01:50:40,702 --> 01:50:45,497
You were certain we would
end up where we are... right now.

1107
01:50:48,669 --> 01:50:50,567
Then again.

1108
01:50:51,476 --> 01:50:53,613
So was I.

1109
01:50:54,037 --> 01:50:55,262
I know you, Lane.

1110
01:50:55,287 --> 01:50:58,293
Somewhere along the line
you had a crisis of faith.

1111
01:50:58,318 --> 01:51:02,191
Human life didn't matter anymore,
or maybe it never really did.

1112
01:51:02,216 --> 01:51:08,363
Either way, you killed too many innocent people
without ever asking who is giving the orders.

1113
01:51:08,388 --> 01:51:09,760
Or why.

1114
01:51:09,785 --> 01:51:11,973
You blame the system
for what you are.

1115
01:51:11,998 --> 01:51:14,348
Instead of yourself.

1116
01:51:14,373 --> 01:51:16,375
You wanted revenge.

1117
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,359
But Rome wasn't
destroyed in a day.

1118
01:51:18,384 --> 01:51:22,218
You needed help, you
needed the money. A lot of it.

1119
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:25,464
And you'll stop at
nothing to get it.

1120
01:51:25,489 --> 01:51:29,428
That's how I know I'm going
to put you in a box.

1121
01:51:30,610 --> 01:51:34,958
- Where is the disk?
- Where is the disk?

1122
01:51:34,983 --> 01:51:38,858
You like to play games.
I've a game for you.

1123
01:51:38,990 --> 01:51:43,652
I'll give you
50 million dollars

1124
01:51:44,272 --> 01:51:46,904
to let Benji go.

1125
01:52:02,405 --> 01:52:07,381
- Where is the disk?
- Where is the disk?

1126
01:52:07,406 --> 01:52:10,225
You're looking at it.
I am the disk.

1127
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:13,871
I memorized it all 2.4 billion
in number accounts.

1128
01:52:13,896 --> 01:52:17,476
If that vest goes off, you get nothing.
Without this money, you are nothing.

1129
01:52:17,501 --> 01:52:21,282
Without me, you are nothing.

1130
01:52:25,434 --> 01:52:29,315
Right now, you're thinking it's bluff.
I'd never let my friends die.

1131
01:52:29,340 --> 01:52:32,619
I couldn't possibly
memorize the entire disk.

1132
01:52:32,644 --> 01:52:35,225
There's only one way
to be sure.

1133
01:52:36,061 --> 01:52:38,206
Let Benji go

1134
01:52:55,385 --> 01:52:57,295
Take him.

1135
01:53:00,489 --> 01:53:03,466
They come 1 step closer,
shoot me.

1136
01:53:04,762 --> 01:53:06,432
Stop.

1137
01:53:09,287 --> 01:53:12,241
You remember I told you, one day
you were going to take things too far?

1138
01:53:12,266 --> 01:53:14,094
This is me speaking, by the way.
It's not him.

1139
01:53:14,119 --> 01:53:19,056
The only way this ends is
you and me, Lane, face to face.

1140
01:53:19,081 --> 01:53:22,088
Only this time I won't
be locked in a glass box.

1141
01:53:22,113 --> 01:53:23,430
You want your money.

1142
01:53:23,455 --> 01:53:26,868
The bone doctor gonna
beat it out of me.

1143
01:53:26,893 --> 01:53:30,429
Now let Benji go

1144
01:53:34,461 --> 01:53:37,506
1... 3... 9

1145
01:53:57,638 --> 01:53:58,940
Go.

1146
01:53:58,965 --> 01:54:02,001
- Ethan.
- Brandt has you waiting, go.

1147
01:54:09,934 --> 01:54:13,092
- What do I do?
- Kill the woman.

1148
01:54:14,186 --> 01:54:16,465
I need Hunt alive.

1149
01:55:03,558 --> 01:55:05,391
- Go!
- It's Benji, where am I going?

1150
01:55:05,416 --> 01:55:07,136
- They're coming.
- We're not ready.

1151
01:55:07,161 --> 01:55:09,139
Then get ready.

1152
01:55:34,882 --> 01:55:36,525
Which way?

1153
01:59:55,955 --> 02:00:00,717
Face to face.
Just as you wish, Ethan

1154
02:00:22,935 --> 02:00:25,226
It hurts, I know.

1155
02:00:26,705 --> 02:00:30,232
Gentlemen, this is Solomon Lane.

1156
02:00:30,652 --> 02:00:32,753
Mr. Lane.

1157
02:00:33,647 --> 02:00:36,506
Meet the IMF.

1158
02:01:55,077 --> 02:01:57,175
You're free now.

1159
02:01:59,418 --> 02:02:01,531
Where will you go?

1160
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:04,389
I don't know.

1161
02:02:06,349 --> 02:02:08,682
I've done my part.

1162
02:02:08,707 --> 02:02:10,358
Yeah.

1163
02:02:15,427 --> 02:02:17,695
Ethan, we got to go.

1164
02:02:26,569 --> 02:02:28,910
You better hurry now.

1165
02:02:30,503 --> 02:02:32,528
Good luck.

1166
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:49,345
You know how to find me.

1167
02:03:06,385 --> 02:03:08,292
Director Hunley.

1168
02:03:09,861 --> 02:03:12,944
- Director Hunley .
- Ah... Mr. Chairman.

1169
02:03:12,969 --> 02:03:17,864
6 months ago, you stood before this panel
and demanded that the IMF be dissolved.

1170
02:03:17,889 --> 02:03:19,529
That is correct, sir.

1171
02:03:19,554 --> 02:03:21,573
And how do you explain
your testimony today?

1172
02:03:21,598 --> 02:03:23,829
It's quite simple really.
We had reason to believe

1173
02:03:23,854 --> 02:03:27,382
that the Syndicate have infiltrated
our government at the highest level.

1174
02:03:27,407 --> 02:03:32,835
In order for our Mn to infiltrate that
organization, his cover had to be absolute.

1175
02:03:32,860 --> 02:03:37,269
The whole operation was known only
to myself and a handful of IMF agents.

1176
02:03:37,294 --> 02:03:42,435
So, the shuttering of the IMF was
all part of an elaborate scheme.

1177
02:03:42,460 --> 02:03:45,812
- To expose this so call Syndicate?
- That is correct, sir.

1178
02:03:45,837 --> 02:03:51,308
Which is why you're here today,
asking for the IMF to be reinstated.

1179
02:03:51,333 --> 02:03:53,616
That is correct, sir.

1180
02:03:55,498 --> 02:03:59,067
I'm not sure the Committee approves
of your methods, Director Hunley.

1181
02:03:59,092 --> 02:04:03,659
Desperate times,
desperate measures, Mr. Chairman.

1182
02:04:04,298 --> 02:04:06,134
And you, Mr. Brandt.

1183
02:04:06,159 --> 02:04:09,608
How can you justify
this deception?

1184
02:04:10,471 --> 02:04:13,866
I can neither confirm nor deny
details of any operation

1185
02:04:13,891 --> 02:04:16,568
without the Secretary's approval.

1186
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:26,142
Welcome to the IMF.

1187
02:04:26,409 --> 02:04:28,729
Mr. Secretary

1188
02:04:30,468 --> 02:04:34,984
