00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:58,499
ONCE, A MAN IN WALLA
WALLA COME AT ME WITH A GUN,

183
00:11:58,568 --> 00:11:59,968
AND I KILLED HIM.

184
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:01,469
I CAN'T THINK OF ONE COMMANDMENT

185
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:02,938
I AIN'T SHATTERED REGULAR.

186
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:05,106
I NEVER DID FANCY MY
MOTHER AND FATHER,

187
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:08,443
LET ALONE RESPECT
THEM OR HONOR THEM,

188
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:10,946
AND I HAVE COVETED
MY NEIGHBOR'S WIFE...

189
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:12,447
WHENEVER I HAD A NEIGHBOR

190
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:14,115
AND WHENEVER HE HAD A WIFE.

191
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:15,083
MM-MMM.

192
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:17,885
AND I GAMBLE, AND
I CHEAT AT CARDS,

193
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:21,389
BUT THERE IS ONE
THING I DO NOT DO.

194
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,992
I AIN'T NEVER GULLED A PARDNER.

195
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,027
THE ONE SACRED THING,

196
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,529
EVEN TO LOW SCUFF LIKE ME,

197
00:12:28,598 --> 00:12:31,266
IS A MAN'S PARDNER.

198
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:33,969
2 PENNYWEIGHT SHORT OF 4 OUNCES.

199
00:12:34,037 --> 00:12:35,703
NOW YOU PASS ME YOUR POUCH.

200
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:37,038
I'LL POUR YOUR SHARE.

201
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,575
AND, PARDNER,

202
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:43,811
I'LL SWAP POUCHES WITH
YOU ANYTIME YOU SAY.

203
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,918
WELL...

204
00:12:49,987 --> 00:12:52,420
I MEANT NO OFFENSE, MR. RUMSON,

205
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:55,757
AND I APPRECIATE YOU
SAVING MY LIFE AND ALL.

206
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:58,026
YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S
EXPECTED OF YOU IN RETURN.

207
00:12:58,095 --> 00:12:59,095
THAT'S RIGHT.

208
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:01,896
I LIKE TO KNOW WHAT
CROPS I'M PLANTING.

209
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,765
WELL, WHEN I GET DEAD DRUNK,

210
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,267
FALL IN A MUDDY STREET,

211
00:13:05,335 --> 00:13:07,769
I EXPECT YOU TO COME GET ME,

212
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:10,038
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO DIE MUDDY DRUNK.

213
00:13:10,107 --> 00:13:13,741
IF I OWE A MAN $100,
STAND GOOD FOR ME,

214
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,611
AND IF I GET MELANCHOLY,
WHICH CAN HAPPEN,

215
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,015
I EXPECT YOU TO BE MY
COMPANION AND SOLACE ME.

216
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:23,051
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU GET IN A FIGHT?

217
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,121
WELL, IF 4 OF ANYTHING
COME AT ME AT ONE TIME,

218
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:27,722
YOU MIGHT LEND A FIST.

219
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,224
UP UNTIL THAT,

220
00:13:29,293 --> 00:13:32,260
I CAN PRETTY WELL
TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

221
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:35,063
YOU SEE, I DON'T FIGHT FAIR.

222
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:37,832
WELL, I DON'T FIGHT AT ALL

223
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:40,168
UNLESS I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

224
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,670
I GOT KIND OF A TEMPER,

225
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,407
AND ONCE I START,
I JUST CAN'T QUIT.

226
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:46,707
WELL, GOOD.

227
00:13:46,776 --> 00:13:50,245
JUST REMEMBER
THAT I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

228
00:13:57,287 --> 00:13:59,354
WELL...

229
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,357
I HEAR A SHOPKEEPER'S
PULLED INTO TOWN

230
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,859
WITH A WAGON FULL OF WHISKEY.

231
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:08,396
WHAT DO YOU SAY I
HOIST YOU UP THAT MULE

232
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:09,764
AND WE GO GET BOILED?

233
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,768
OH, I AIN'T A BOOZING
MAN EITHER, MR. RUMSON.

234
00:14:16,806 --> 00:14:18,573
WELL, I AM.

235
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:22,410
[MAN] TOWN MEETING TONIGHT!

236
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:25,413
THERE'S GOING TO BE A
TOWN MEETING TONIGHT!

237
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:26,948
TOWN MEETING TONIGHT, BEN.

238
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:29,417
BLAAH!

239
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:30,952
BEN! BEN RUMSON!

240
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:32,498
MOONEY! THIS IS MY PARDNER.

241
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:35,457
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON
YOUR WAY BACK TO IRELAND.

242
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,225
WELL, I AM. I'M JUST
PASSING THROUGH HERE.

243
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,793
IT'S RIGHT ON THE WAY, YOU KNOW.

244
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:39,862
MOONEY.

245
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:46,846
HOW'S IT GOING, WILLIE?

246
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,405
I AIN'T WON A HAND
IN 3 WEEKS, BEN.

247
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:51,939
THIS IS MY PARDNER.

248
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:54,175
HE CALLS HIMSELF
ROTTEN LUCK WILLIE,

249
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:55,621
BUT THAT'S JUST TO
GET THE SUCKERS.

250
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,390
YOU COULDN'T BEAT
HIM WITH 5 ACES,

251
00:14:57,414 --> 00:14:59,314
SO DON'T PLAY WITH HIM.

252
00:14:59,383 --> 00:15:00,915
OH, I DON'T GAMBLE.

253
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:03,551
UH-HUH. NEITHER DOES HE.

254
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,187
[SNORING]

255

258
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:16,297
AHA!

259
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:17,298
HEY, I WAS SITTING THERE.

260
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:18,844
NOW YOU'RE STANDING THERE.

261
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:20,067
GIVE HIM A WHISKEY.

262
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:21,069
BEN RUMSON,

263
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:23,104

265
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,245
AND WHICH YOU

266
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:32,347
SKIPPED TOWN ON YOU?

267
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,293
I WAS RUN OUT. DON'T

268
00:15:34,317 --> 00:15:36,251
I WANT TO BE PAID NOW

269
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:38,520
BEFORE THEY RUN

270
00:15:38,588 --> 00:15:40,055

271
00:15:40,123 --> 00:15:42,323
AND STAND THESE

00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,459
DRY YOUR HANDS

282
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:03,678
WHEN DID YOU GET IN?

283
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:05,224

287
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,187
IT SAYS HERE

288
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:15,301
CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO
BE ADMITTED TO THE UNION.

289
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:16,757
JUST WHAT IT NEEDS...

290
00:16:16,826 --> 00:16:18,293
LAW AND ORDER.

291
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:19,794
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

292
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:21,296
WELL, IT AIN'T TO ME.

293
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:24,031
IT'S MY POLICY TO BUST
OUT OF ANY TERRITORY

294
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:27,180
THE DAY IT BECOME A STATE AND
HEAD FOR ANOTHER WILDERNESS.

295
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:28,444
I DON'T AGREE, SIR.

296
00:16:28,472 --> 00:16:30,049
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

297

1418
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:09,544
THAT'S THE DECENTEST MAN

1419
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:11,001
I EVER RUN ACROSS.

1420
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:12,536
AND THE STRONGEST.

1421
01:23:14,607 --> 01:23:16,507
NOW...

1422
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:19,510
I KNOW YOU WOMEN
LIKE THINGS LEGAL,

1423
01:23:19,578 --> 01:23:21,011
SO HERE'S WHAT.

1424
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:22,513
IT TAKES TWO WEEKS

1425
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:25,015
FOR YOU TO BE AN
ABANDONED CLAIM.

1426
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:27,061
AFTER THAT, YOU TAKE THE NAME

1427
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:28,519
OF YOUR NEW OWNER

1428
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:32,523
AND FILE IT DOWN
AT THE MINING OFFICE.

1429
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:34,725
THEN EVERYTHING WILL BE LEGAL.

1430
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:39,730
BEN!

1431
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:42,577
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

1432
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:44,067
I LOVE YOU.

1433
01:23:46,204 --> 01:23:48,739
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, ELIZABETH?

1434
01:23:51,544 --> 01:23:53,176
YOU'RE MY HUSBAND.

1435
01:23:53,245 --> 01:23:55,285
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO AWAY.

1436
01:23:55,347 --> 01:23:56,613
WHAT WAS THAT?

1437
01:23:56,682 --> 01:23:58,114
DON'T LET HIM GO, PARDNER.

1438
01:24:02,054 --> 01:24:04,487
YOU SAID SHE WAS
IN LOVE WITH ME.

1439
01:24:04,557 --> 01:24:06,924
DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY
THAT YOU LOVED HIM?

1440
01:24:06,992 --> 01:24:09,492
YES, I DID, AND I DO.

1441
01:24:09,561 --> 01:24:11,895
YOU JUST SAID YOU
WERE IN LOVE WITH BEN.

1442
01:24:11,981 --> 01:24:14,061
YES, I DID, AND I AM.

1443
01:24:16,569 --> 01:24:18,001
BEN, DO YOU, UH...

1444
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:21,504
DO YOU GET THE FEELING
YOU NEED A DRINK?

1445
01:24:21,574 --> 01:24:23,006
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

1446
01:24:23,075 --> 01:24:25,042
'CAUSE I DO, TOO.

1447
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:27,678
BUT, PARDNER, YOU DON'T DRINK.

1448
01:24:27,746 --> 01:24:29,880
NO, BUT I'M CHANGING.

1449
01:24:29,949 --> 01:24:33,550
HMM, AND IT TAKES
A WOMAN TO DO IT.

1450
01:24:34,587 --> 01:24:36,053
BLESS THEIR HEARTS.

1451
01:24:43,762 --> 01:24:44,762
[COUGHS]

1452
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,997
NOW, ELIZABETH,

1453
01:24:47,066 --> 01:24:51,034
LET'S TRY AND BE
REASONABLE ABOUT THIS.

1454
01:24:51,103 --> 01:24:54,905
FOR GOD'S SAKE,
MAKE UP YOUR MIND!

1455
01:24:56,108 --> 01:24:57,240
I CAN'T.

1456
01:24:58,611 --> 01:25:00,544
I LOVE BOTH OF YOU.

1457
01:25:00,613 --> 01:25:03,547
BUT THAT AIN'T GOING
TO WORK, ELIZABETH.

1458
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:05,883
YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH OF US.

1459
01:25:05,951 --> 01:25:06,884
WHY NOT?

1460
01:25:06,952 --> 01:25:08,719
WHY NOT?

1461
01:25:08,788 --> 01:25:10,554
WHY NOT?

1462
01:25:10,623 --> 01:25:12,055
'CAUSE, UH...

1463
01:25:12,124 --> 01:25:14,558
A WOMAN CAN'T HAVE TWO HUSBANDS.

1464
01:25:14,627 --> 01:25:17,060
WELL, I WAS MARRIED TO A MAN

1465
01:25:17,129 --> 01:25:18,562
WHO HAD TWO WIVES.

1466
01:25:18,631 --> 01:25:21,565
WHY CAN'T A WOMAN
HAVE TWO HUSBANDS?

1467
01:25:21,634 --> 01:25:24,100
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T.

1468
01:25:24,169 --> 01:25:26,603
WELL, WHY?

1469
01:25:26,672 --> 01:25:30,707
YOU EXPLAIN IT TO
HER, WILL YOU, BEN?

1470
01:25:30,776 --> 01:25:32,120
I'D LIKE TO OBLIGE, PARDNER,

1471
01:25:32,144 --> 01:25:36,079
BUT I'LL BE DAMNED IF I
CAN THINK OF A REASON.

1472
01:25:36,148 --> 01:25:40,083
OUT HERE WE MAKE UP OUR
OWN RULES AS WE GO ALONG.

1473
01:25:40,152 --> 01:25:42,586
A MAN RIDES INTO
TOWN WITH TWO WIVES,

1474
01:25:42,655 --> 01:25:44,521
WANTS TO SELL ONE AT AUCTION,

1475
01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:45,923
NOBODY THINKS TWICE.

1476
01:25:45,991 --> 01:25:48,024
IF A TOWN NEEDS
FEMALE COMPANIONSHIP,

1477
01:25:48,093 --> 01:25:50,527
HIJACKING THEM SEEMS
THE NATURAL THING TO DO,

1478
01:25:50,596 --> 01:25:53,330
AND IF TWO PARDNERS WANT
TO SHARE THE SAME WIFE,

1479
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:54,331
WHY NOT?

1480
01:25:54,417 --> 01:25:55,833
THIS AIN'T MICHIGAN.

1481
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:57,367
IT'S GOLD COUNTRY.

1482
01:25:57,453 --> 01:26:00,604
WHY, HELL, IT'S THE
GOLDEN COUNTRY,

1483
01:26:00,672 --> 01:26:03,106
UNTOUCHED AND
UNCONTAMINATED BY HUMAN HANDS!

1484
01:26:03,175 --> 01:26:05,041
IT'S WHERE PEOPLE CAN SOMEDAY

1485
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:07,444
LOOK CIVILIZATION
STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND SPIT!

1486
01:26:07,513 --> 01:26:09,257
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PLEASE ANYBODY,

1487
01:26:09,281 --> 01:26:10,759
DON'T HAVE TO LOVE THY NEIGHBOR.

1488
01:26:10,783 --> 01:26:12,015
LEAVE THE BASTARD ALONE.

1489
01:26:12,101 --> 01:26:15,018
IT'S WILD, HUMAN, AND FREE,

1490
01:26:15,104 --> 01:26:16,720
AND ALL OVER THIS NATION,

1491
01:26:16,789 --> 01:26:18,567
THEY PREACH AGAINST
IT EVERY SUNDAY,

1492
01:26:18,591 --> 01:26:21,024
BUT I DON'T THINK
GOD'S LISTENING.

1493
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:23,594
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE HE'S HERE...

1494
01:26:23,662 --> 01:26:26,096
IN GLORIOUS CALIFORNIA!

1495
01:26:26,164 --> 01:26:30,033
YOU TRYING TO TELL ME,
BEN, THAT YOU'RE WILLING?

1496
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:31,835
I AM.

1497
01:26:31,904 --> 01:26:34,905
I THINK IT'S A HUMANE,

1498
01:26:34,974 --> 01:26:37,574
PRACTICAL, BEAUTIFUL SOLUTION.

1499
01:26:37,643 --> 01:26:39,526
IT DOES MAKE A LOT OF SENSE.

1500
01:26:39,595 --> 01:26:40,644
IT DON'T.

1501
01:26:40,713 --> 01:26:43,914
IT DON'T IN MICHIGAN.
IT DOES IN CALIFORNIA.

1502
01:26:43,983 --> 01:26:45,849
WELL, WHAT'S
EVERYBODY GONNA SAY?

1503
01:26:45,935 --> 01:26:48,015
WHAT EVERYBODY ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1504
01:26:48,053 --> 01:26:49,693
YOU MEAN EVERYBODY IN TOWN

1505
01:26:49,722 --> 01:26:51,867
PLAYING CHAMBER MUSIC
WITH THEM FRENCH HORNS?

1506
01:26:51,891 --> 01:26:55,358
THEY'D BE DAMN GLAD TO HAVE
TWO LESS IN LINE, AND YOU KNOW IT.

1507
01:27:04,436 --> 01:27:06,469
BEN, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1508
01:27:06,539 --> 01:27:07,838
OF COURSE I'M RIGHT.

1509
01:27:07,907 --> 01:27:09,885
YOU'VE BEEN CARRYING ON
LIKE SOMEBODY WAS ASKING YOU

1510
01:27:09,909 --> 01:27:11,686
TO DO SOMETHING
DOWNRIGHT IMMORAL,

1511
01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:14,011
LIKE STEALING GOLD!

1512
01:27:14,079 --> 01:27:16,046
IT AIN'T AS BAD AS ALL THAT.

1513
01:27:16,114 --> 01:27:17,531
WHAT'S BAD ABOUT IT?

1514
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,183
SHOW ME ON THAT LIST
OF TEN COMMANDMENTS

1515
01:27:20,252 --> 01:27:23,086
WHERE IT SAYS A WOMAN
CAN'T HAVE TWO HUSBANDS.

1516
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:25,689
THERE AIN'T NO
COMMANDMENT LIKE THAT.

1517
01:27:27,593 --> 01:27:28,525
HOT DAMN.

1518
01:27:28,594 --> 01:27:30,527
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

1519
01:27:30,596 --> 01:27:32,095
IT'S HISTORY-MAKING.

1520
01:27:40,606 --> 01:27:42,472
CAN'T HOLD IT.

1521
01:27:48,047 --> 01:27:49,646
ELIZABETH...

1522
01:27:49,715 --> 01:27:51,314
YES, BEN?

1523
01:27:51,383 --> 01:27:52,816
WE WILL BE THREE...

1524
01:27:52,885 --> 01:27:53,885
FOR DINNER.

1525
01:28:09,368 --> 01:28:11,601
<i>[PAINT YOUR WAGON</i> MEDLEY PLAYS]

1526
01:32:56,021 --> 01:32:57,221
SHAMELESS HARLOTS!

1527
01:32:57,256 --> 01:32:59,689
YOU THINK THE LORD
WAS SOME OLD BOY

1528
01:32:59,758 --> 01:33:02,192
GOING AROUND IN A
RAGGEDY OLD SHEET

1529
01:33:02,261 --> 01:33:03,693
2,000 YEARS AGO?

1530
01:33:03,762 --> 01:33:05,862
YOU'RE WRONG. HE'S HERE NOW,

1531
01:33:05,931 --> 01:33:07,063
AND HE SEES YOU!

1532
01:33:14,039 --> 01:33:16,606
YE GODLESS JASPERS!

1533
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:18,108
WHO ARE YOU?

1534
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:19,109
FREEMASONS?

1535
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:20,377
ROSICRUCIANS?

1536
01:33:20,445 --> 01:33:23,997
HEATHEN EMISSARIES
FROM THE DENS OF BABYLON?

1537
01:33:24,065 --> 01:33:25,382
BOOZERS.

1538
01:33:25,450 --> 01:33:26,716
GLUTTONS.

1539
01:33:26,785 --> 01:33:28,218
GAMBLERS.

1540
01:33:28,287 --> 01:33:29,719
HARLOTS.

1541
01:33:29,788 --> 01:33:31,437
FORNICATORS!

1542
01:33:32,791 --> 01:33:34,724
WHAT'S A FORNICATOR?

1543
01:33:34,793 --> 01:33:38,328
I DON'T KNOW. I AIN'T
A RELIGIOUS MAN.

1544
01:33:44,436 --> 01:33:48,171
THE STENCH OF THE CITY
IS IN THE LORD'S NOSTRILS,

1545
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,605
AND IT'S MAKING HIM SICK.

1546
01:33:49,674 --> 01:33:53,209
THE LORD AIN'T GOING
TO TAKE IT MUCH LONGER!

1547
01:33:53,278 --> 01:33:54,710
COME ON UP, PARSON,

1548
01:33:54,779 --> 01:33:57,580
AND GET SOME OLD-TIME RELIGION.

1549
01:33:57,649 --> 01:33:59,169
HA HA HA! HA HA HA!

1550
01:34:04,689 --> 01:34:06,056
GOOD MORNING, MRS. RUMSON.

1551
01:34:06,124 --> 01:34:07,223
HOW ARE YOUR HUSBANDS?

1552
01:34:07,292 --> 01:34:09,770
THEY'RE FINE. THANK
YOU, MR. ATWELL.

1553
01:34:09,794 --> 01:34:10,726
HUSBANDS?

1554
01:34:10,795 --> 01:34:13,229
DID I HEAR HUSBANDS?

1555
01:34:13,298 --> 01:34:15,398
YOU ANIMALS!

1556
01:34:15,467 --> 01:34:17,167
YOU PAGANS!

1557
01:34:18,136 --> 01:34:20,070
O GOD, LORD OF HOSTS,

1558
01:34:20,138 --> 01:34:23,573
CLOSE THINE EYES,
THEN HOLD THY NOSE.

1559
01:34:23,641 --> 01:34:27,077
I AM PASSING THROUGH
THE GARBAGE OF HUMANITY!

1560
01:34:27,145 --> 01:34:28,622
HA HA HA! HA HA HA!

1561
01:34:28,646 --> 01:34:30,080
COME ON, DEARIE.

1562
01:34:30,148 --> 01:34:32,082
SCUM, KEEP YOUR FILTHY CLAWS

1563
01:34:32,150 --> 01:34:34,584
OFF MY WIFE PRINCESS
HUMMINGBIRD!

1564
01:34:34,652 --> 01:34:37,087
HA HA HA! HA HA HA!

1565
01:34:37,155 --> 01:34:38,554
YOU HEATHEN SWINE!

1566
01:34:38,623 --> 01:34:42,558
DO YOU KNOW WHAT GOD
DONE TO SODOM AND GOMORRAH

1567
01:34:42,627 --> 01:34:45,095
WHEN HE COULDN'T
FIND 50 RIGHTEOUS MEN

1568
01:34:45,163 --> 01:34:46,283
IN THEM STINKING CITIES?

1569
01:34:46,331 --> 01:34:47,475
NO! NO!

1570
01:34:47,499 --> 01:34:50,367
I'LL SHOW GOD A PLACE
WHERE THERE AIN'T 40.

1571
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:51,368
YEAH! YEAH!

1572
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:52,369
30!

1573

YEAH! YEAH!

1574

2271
02:13:16,138 --> 02:13:18,571
I DON'T HAVE YOUR

THEN WHY ARE WE HIDING IT?

2277
02:13:29,151 --> 02:13:31,084
WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT IT?
