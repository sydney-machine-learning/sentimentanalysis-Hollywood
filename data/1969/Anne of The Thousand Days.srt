1
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,950
- What is the verdict?
- Guilty, Your Grace.

2
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,230
All of them?

3
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,478
Guilty.

4
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,949
* Farewell, farewell
My pleasure past

5
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,676
* Welcome my present pain

6
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,317
* Welcome the torment in my heart

7
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,389
* To see my love again *

8
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,709
Warrant for the execution of
Sir Henry Norris for adultery with Annee,

9
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,876
Queen of England.

10
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,519
For the execution of Mark Smeaton
for the treason of adultery with Annee,

11
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,278
Queen of England.

12
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,632
To the Lieutenant Governor of the Tower
of London a warrant for the execution...

13
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,716
...of Annee, Queen of England.

14
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,150
For adultery and treason.

15
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,750
To be burned or beheaded
at the King's pleasure.

16
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,039
Annee, Queen of England.

17
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,548
My wife.

18
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,315
My wife, Cromwell.

19
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,638
She has borne you a useless daughter
and a dead son.

20
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,434
When we married she promised me a son.

21
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,756
I must have a son to rule
when I am dead.

22
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,111
God guided the conscience
and answered prayers of the King.

23
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,869
- He will not let you condemn unjustly.
- Then why do I hesitate?

24
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,072
Is the hesitation from God?

25
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,398
Or is He telling me you must die, you
who found evidence and arranged trial?

26
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,353
I care only that the King rules
absolutely.

27
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,076
The Queen despised her marriage
and indulged her carnal lust.

28
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,316
Betrayed me?

29
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,192
Did she, Cromwell? Did she?

30
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,589
Your Grace, the Queen betrayed you
and stands condemned.

31
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,872
The warrant is before you.

32
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,433
If she betrayed me, she must die.

33
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,837
If I am to rule, keep my sanity,
and hold England off the rocks,

34
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,510
and as you say, God would not
allow me to condemn unjustly.

35
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,713
If I question that, I question
my whole life and all I’ve done.

36
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,551
At times, I do question it.

37
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,836
Write it down.

38
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,237
Write down Henry Rex and it's done.

39
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,796
I’ve condemned men before,
nobles and peasants, why not a queen?

40
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,436
She struck down a few herself
or driven me to do it for her.

41
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,998
It's only...

42
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,875
It’s only that when you've
held a woman in your arms

43
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,594
and longed for her when she's away,

44
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,438
suffered with her

45
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,076
and waited with her
for the outcome of the child bed...

46
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,119
You promised me a son.

47
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,151
Annee.

48
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,078
Annee!

49
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,397
She's new.

50
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,310
Boleyn's youngest daughter.
Newly returned from the French court.

51
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,112
Do you like her, Kate?

52
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,198
Shall we keep her here at court
to cheer you?

53
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,954
Whatever you command, My Lord.

54
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,958
And suppose I command you
to give me a son?

55
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,991
- Would to God I could, Henry.
- Amen.

56
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,955
But you cAnneot, because our marriage
is accursed in heaven and hell, madam.

57
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,636
Play on. Play on.
The Queen wishes it and I command it.

58
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,478
Play!

59
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,876
When I call for it,
tell the musicians to play my galliard.

60
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,078
And see to it, More,
that there is no argument.

61
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,430
My Lord Bishop.

62
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,396
Your Majesty.

63
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,514
- If it please Your Grace...
- No politics, Wolsey.

64
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,995
Go and commune with the devil
while I dance.

65
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,589
No, just a simple domestic matter.
A wedding.

66
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,156
Any man who marries
when he can be free is a fool.

67
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,955
Here. Here is the couple.

68
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,235
Young Percy, Northumberland's son.
He's a member of my household.

69
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,998
And Annee Boleyn.

70
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,272
Their parents agreed.
Have they your permission to marry?

71
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,879
- I’ve told them...
- No.

72
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,799
- "No", did Your Grace say?
- No.

73
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,959
- But it is a love match.
- Un-match them, Wolsey, unmatch them.

74
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,948
And send the Boleyns, father,
mother, son and eldest daughter,

75
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,119
back to their castle in Kent,
and send Annee with them tonight.

76
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,038
Yes, sir.

77
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,519
I’m bored, Wolsey.
I’m bored with the court.

78
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,998
Bored with my Spanish cow.

79
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,191
I shall go hunting

80
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,755
in the beautiful country of Kent.

81
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,793
- Your Grace.
- No ceremony.

82
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,037
I have a mind to put you all to shame.
You're short of breath.

83
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,958
- A misspent life, sir.
- No doubt.

84
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,390
Brereton, you keep time like a deaf man.

85
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,355
- Your Grace has learned my secret.
- Norfolk, sit by the fire at your age.

86
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,109
- Better to lie by it, Your Grace.
- Yes, but with whom?

87
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,552
Percy, you have feet of lead,
a northern clodhopper.

88
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,637
With your permission,

89
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,753
Mistress Annee, will you teach the King
how they dance at the court of France?

90
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,077
There is nothing France
can teach England, Your Majesty.

91
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,396
Well said.

92
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,599
Well said.

93
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,995
The galliard. Play.

94
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,235
My Lord?

95
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,749
Tell Boleyn
I wish to speak to him privately.

96
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,555
- Yes, My Lord.
- And then prepare for a journey.

97
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,035
- A journey?
- Yes.

98
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,279
For where the dove is
the hawk will not be far behind.

99
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,313
To Hever Castle in Kent.

100
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,237
Mary, it must be said,
the King wishes to see me alone.

101
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,237
He asked not to see me?

102
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,396
Not directly.

103
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,036
That could mean he's finished with me.

104
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,558
Has he? Tell me the truth.

105
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,470
One never gets used to these things.
There is always a hell to go through.

106
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,478
When a girl gives herself
so completely...

107
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,911
You know why I gave myself to the King.

108
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,510
Since I opened my bedroom door to him,
you've lived well by it.

109
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,756
Steward of Tonbridge and Penshurst.

110
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,269
Sheriff of Bradsted. Viscount.

111
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,232
And now King's Treasurer.

112
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,238
You don't want to lose those revenues,
do you, Father?

113
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,989
Mary, I have always loved you.
All those things are true.

114
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,637
The King was generous to me
because you were generous to him.

115
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,753
But you're a fool because you gave him
everything and asked for nothing.

116
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,520
What His Majesty is denied,
he goes mad to obtain.

117
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,508
What he gets freely, he despises.
You have lost him.

118
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,712
I can't help you.
Go now and cause no trouble.

119
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,639
I will not have you
put the rest of us at risk.

120
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,236
- What ails you?
- Ask our beloved father.

121
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,159
Father, the Lord Cardinal is here.

122
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,350
- Boleyn. I see you've told the lady.
- Yes, My Lord.

123
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,039
- And Annee?
- No.

124
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,028
- Why not? The King is almost here.
- Like you, I encouraged her with Percy.

125
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,277
It never entered my head
that the King would look at her.

126
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,833
My Lord, the King is here.

127
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,190
- There is no time...
- Leave the girl to me.

128
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,631
Tell the King what rubbish you please,
but give me time.

129
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,912
As for young Percy,
he'll do as I bid him.

130
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,195
Whoa, boy.

131
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,509
Your Majesty.

132
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,917
Only your King, Thomas.
No ceremony. Only your Henry.

133
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,872
This is a great honour.

134
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,396
From Harry Percy?

135
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,914
Where is Annee, Lady Elizabeth?

136
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,553
I found this in her room.

137
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,875
- How is the Vicar of Hell this morning?
- Warm enough, Your Majesty.

138
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,277
To be active on the King's business
generates a certain heat.

139
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,596
Yes, with your feet
on the devil's fender

140
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,189
and your buttocks toasting
at God's altar.

141
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,714
- Has he spoken to you?
- He has, Your Grace.

142
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,229
Good. Good.

143
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,793
And when may I smell this
pretty posy of yours?

144
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,709
If you mean Annee, sir,
she is still at her mirror.

145
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,799
A new dress, nervous fingers. If you
could give her half an hour, perhaps?

146
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,037
- We have this whole day, Thomas.
- I’ve a new pack of hounds

147
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,356
and there's a clump of deer
in the meadow.

148
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,994
- We'll see one, hunt the other.
- Good hunting.

149
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,237
- You'll not be with us?
- It appears there are two poor souls

150
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,431
who seek religious comfort.
I must go.

151
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,155
Indeed, My Lord Cardinal, indeed.
God's work must come first.

152
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,830
And, who knows, there may be
a little worldly profit attached.

153
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,519
Oh, Your Majesty...

154
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,029
Find them, bring them to me.

155
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,790
Thomas, a private word with you
before I meet Annee.

156
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,035
Yes, Your Grace?

157
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,073
There is always a temptation
for a man in my position

158
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,637
to regard the nation as his own trough
and to eat from one end to the other.

159
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,400
- Not Your Grace.
- Why not? Who can say no to me?

160
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,955
Except God, and He does, Thomas.

161
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,674
I kneel. I pray. He answers.

162
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,189
But can that be seen to be so?

163
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,188
Why else would His Holiness the Pope
have named you Defender of the Faith?

164
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,551
True. True.
I am a religious man.

165
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:28,470
I want to do right by God
and the Church,

166
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,549
and the people and myself,
and you, Thomas.

167
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,591
Do you follow?

168
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,078
That's a swathe of folk to satisfy,
if it includes God, Your Grace.

169
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,396
It includes your two daughters, Thomas.

170
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,068
- Are they friends?
- Yes.

171
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,840
And do they exchange confidences,
do you think?

172
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,318
Do they whisper together at night
secrets about me, perhaps?

173
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,238
Who knows, Your Grace?

174
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,273
The one you have had,
the other you desire.

175
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,399
Will Annee have me, and for myself?

176
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,149
- I want an honest answer.
- She's no fool, My Lord.

177
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,353
Good. Good.

178
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,916
What I do is God's will
and my prayer always is

179
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,590
that He will allow no thought
to enter my heart or mind

180
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,358
that is not His will.

181
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,597
He has...
He has never failed me, Thomas.

182
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,268
But Your Majesty realizes
this might seem as...

183
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,232
As what?

184
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,477
As an excuse to do as you please,

185
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,035
to eat the trough dry.

186
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,117
I’m the King of England.
When I pray, God answers.

187
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,352
Yes, Your Grace.

188
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,757
And let no man dare question that.

189
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,078
Or woman.

190
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,954
Again.

191
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,999
- I’m angry with myself.
- Why?

192
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,033
Well, think of the years I spent
at the French court.

193
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,074
I was surrounded by gallant,
captivating, exquisite French courtiers

194
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,396
and I loved none of them.

195
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,114
No sooner do I return
than I fall in love with a...

196
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,880
- "Clodhopper", said His Majesty.
- He was right.

197
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,514
No mAnneers, can't dance,
can't sing, can't...

198
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,032
- Can put his arms around you.
- Not as well as I’ve known it done.

199
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,518
But they are the arms I want,
for some God knows what reason.

200
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,678
I love your awkwardness.

201
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,870
But if we love enough to marry,
we must keep nothing back.

202
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,911
So?

203
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,430
- Are we to bed together? Before?
- If you like.

204
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,233
Kiss me.

205
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,990
Are you a virgin?

206
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,317
- I’m a man.
- I know, but are you a virgin?

207
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,239
When we bed together,
shall I be your first?

208
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,510
- I...
- Speak out.

209
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,109
Well, I’ll say it frankly
as they do in France.

210
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,074
In England we make muddy mysteries
of such things as if they were crimes.

211
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,034
We don't come out of a rainbow at 17
and there's no use pretending we do.

212
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,674
You may ask me whatever you like.

213
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,997
- Are you a virgin?
- No.

214
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,153
- In France?
- Yes. And long before.

215
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,069
When I was little,

216
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,875
I was playing with a boy
and he threw me down...

217
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,389
The King refuses you
permission to marry.

218
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,310
- But...
- Why? Why, My Lord?

219
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,988
Marriages of the nobility
are affairs of State.

220
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,679
I was wrong to encourage you.

221
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,236
The King wishes you to marry
a daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury.

222
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,635
I am pledged to Annee.
It is a good match.

223
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,549
I brought you to court. You're a member
of my household. You will obey.

224
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,957
The world knew we meant to marry.
Nothing was said against it.

225
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,515
You've heard the King's pleasure
against it.

226
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,678
A half grown steer and a leggy girl

227
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,678
will not be allowed
to overturn the policies of State.

228
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,632
Why was nothing said?

229
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,400
Her father, my father,
and you, My Lord Cardinal,

230
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,273
who knows the King's business
better than himself.

231
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,674
Be silent!

232
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,235
You will obey
or your estates will be forfeit.

233
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,070
If you show further disloyalty,
it's doubtful how long you'll live.

234
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,716
The Duke of Buckingham
lost his head for less. Now go.

235
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,196
You must go.

236
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,789
Kiss me, then.

237
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,116
Don't touch her.

238
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,636
- Be careful of yourself.
- I will, for you.

239
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,039
My Lord, I love him truly

240
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,959
and we are pledged to each other.

241
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,515
If you force him to marry elsewhere,

242
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,598
although I am only a girl,
you'll know you have an enemy.

243
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,199
Madam, you do me wrong.

244
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,278
I have no spleen against you,
I am only a messenger.

245
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,870
Messenger? Who has chosen for me?

246
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,870
When Henry of England
turns his eyes on a girl,

247
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,277
she can hardly look away.

248
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,788
- The King has asked for me?
- He has.

249
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,355
And sent you to me?

250
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,553
It is sometimes my duty
to anticipate his desires.

251
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,116
Even in carnal matters,
My Lord Cardinal?

252
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,393
We have had the King in the bosom
of this family for some years.

253
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,513
My sister Mary is with child by him
and of no further use.

254
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,871
I shall not go the way of my sister.

255
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,230
You would be wise to anticipate
my answer

256
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,352
and spare His Majesty any Anneoyance.

257
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,755
I will not be a mistress of the King

258
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,474
even with the blessing
of a prince of the Church.

259
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,952
- Good sport in Boleyn's woods.
- And in his bowers.

260
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,832
I heard you, Norris.

261
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,191
Well, you two, tell me,
man to man, all kingship aside,

262
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,755
- what's the best way to win a maid?
- A maid?

263
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,191
I couldn't swear to it medically,
but it's young and it's wild.

264
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,960
My skills are not for
the grade of female you seek.

265
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,515
I’m more successful with waiting women.

266
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,314
Don't be modest.
I’ve followed your spoor so close

267
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,193
there was scarce time
to close the window you left by

268
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,595
or change perfumes
to put me off the scent.

269
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,950
Speak on, your lure,
your most seductive.

270
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,277
- You'll not be offended?
- I’ll be offended if you hold back.

271
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,076
If you truly want her, make her believe
that you are potent only with her.

272
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,396
Pretend that you've tried with others.

273
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,469
Gone to bed, kissed hotly,
but hung embarrassed and unable.

274
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,399
But with her you rouse up.
You're a man again.

275
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,795
They can't resist that.
They open like...

276
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,233
Never mind the simile.
Yes. What a game. What a ploy.

277
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,955
Dare I ask, has Your Grace
ever been refused by a wench?

278
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,832
Who? I? Refused? Why, never.

279
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,669
When I’ve wanted them, I’ve had them.
When I’ve had a wench, I’m cured.

280
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,711
That's general, isn't it?

281
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,436
Your Grace, can you all leave talking
of virgins to look at the venison?

282
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,757
Yes, yes. Come, come.
Next to the haunch of a virgin,

283
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,872
there's nothing
like a haunch of venison.

284
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,235
Do you also offer me up
to this royal bull?

285
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,237
You, my father?
And you, my mother?

286
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,876
- Lower your voice!
- Do you know what it is to be in love?

287
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,517
- I love Harry Percy and will marry him.
- You'll have us all dead or disgraced.

288
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,996
Lower your voice.
The royal bull can't force you.

289
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,758
Brother, I must fight. I must.

290
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,428
Do you know what it means
when a king asks for you?

291
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,756
I can ask my pregnant
and foolish sister.

292
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,111
Turn him away and we can say farewell
to all we've worked for.

293
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,756
If our parents had not taken advantage
what would've become of us?

294
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,951
If we lose favour, we lose everything.

295
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,517
Then say goodbye to it all,
for I will not take the King to my bed!

296
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,358
Your Majesty.

297
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,913
I was so anxious to see you, madam,
I ran ahead.

298
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,510
Have you been faithful to me
or lying about with this husband?

299
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,075
Remarkable women you breed, you Howards.

300
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,838
[laughter]

301
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,758
Norfolk, greet your sister.

302
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,793
I’ve brought your brother
to make sure I was welcome.

303
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,437
George, you should have hunted with us
and not stayed at home with the ladies.

304
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,031
Nan.

305
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,074
- Give me a kiss.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

306
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,356
And now on the lips, sweet Nan.

307
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,109
I’ve been taking medicines for a cold.
My breath is foul, Your Grace.

308
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,392
Your health is very dear to us.
You must needs keep well.

309
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,272
We live all too brief a span.

310
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,233
What little we have
should not be wasted.

311
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,870
Well, there's no trace of medicine
or fever on these sweet lips.

312
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,432
The surprise of Your Majesty's visit
must have cured me.

313
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,633
Wonderful. I shall continue the cure.
Shall I dismiss the chaperones?

314
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,037
- By your leave.
- Yes, by your leave.

315
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,514
Yes, without your leave.

316
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,109
Off. Out. All of you, go.

317
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,073
Companions, brothers.

318
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,352
Lawyer. Go.

319
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:54,319
Annee, you see before you
not the King, but a poor fellow

320
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,594
as uncertain, as eager,
as hopeful, as afraid

321
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,268
as any man that ever fell in love.

322
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,993
I see the King.

323
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,715
Believe me, all kingship on one side.

324
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,755
Women give love to the King
like paying taxes.

325
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,916
I wish to be loved for myself.

326
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,554
Well, as you say you're not the King,

327
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,117
but only a poor, uncertain,
eager, hopeful fellow.

328
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,996
Could you tell me why the King sent an
old Church pander to give me my orders?

329
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,236
- Pander?
- The Lord Cardinal Wolsey.

330
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,715
Oh. Did he speak clumsily?

331
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,876
No, Your Grace.
He spoke to the point.

332
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,798
What the King wants, he will have.

333
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,436
No, Annee. It’s quite the reverse.
What you want, you shall have.

334
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,949
- If I have you first.
- Not against your will.

335
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,390
- Not?
- Never.

336
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,118
I’ll earn your love
and then your bed.

337
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,756
Tell me what things you want.
Prove me.

338
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,390
There is one thing I want.

339
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,477
I want something that has gone.

340
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,638
You shall have it.
Now walk with me, talk with me.

341
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,549
I love your sweet voice,
your company and your bold spirit.

342
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,069
Tell me, dare I ask it?

343
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,556
Is there anything about me
that you love?

344
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,830
No.

345
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,268
My God.

346
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,710
You asked not to be treated
like the King.

347
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,354
I would have lied to the King.

348
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,074
No one has ever talked to me
like that before.

349
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,795
My sweet voice will not lie to you.

350
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,197
But in time, Nan,
you'll grow to love me.

351
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,319
Anything is possible.

352
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,956
With us everything is possible.

353
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,596
That's settled. I can return to London.

354
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,394
- You, Cromwell, will remain here.
- Here, My Lord?

355
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,239
To keep me informed.

356
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,108
Tell My Lord of Suffolk that we shall
entertain no more such petitions.

357
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,597
Show that to Sir Thomas More,
that's his province.

358
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,995
Ah, Thomas.

359
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,270
You smell of horse sweat.

360
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,517
His Majesty has sent me to inform you,
My Lord, that the...

361
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,838
...entertainment at Hever suits him
well, and he intends to remain.

362
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,918
Excellent. No, tell Lovell
his request is denied.

363
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,873
That witch has been leading him
a dance for two weeks.

364
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,514
She'll go the way of all the rest.
Granted.

365
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,077
The King should be attending to matters
of State, not pursuing a reluctant girl.

366
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,157
If he wants her, he should take her.

367
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,874
What is Sir Thomas More's opinion
about that?

368
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,152
Master Cromwell,
when you counsel the King

369
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,557
tell him what he ought to do,
but never what he is able to do.

370
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,309
If he knew his real strength, it
would be hard for any man to rule him.

371
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:01,469
- He ought to leave Hever.
- Let sleeping kings lie, Thomas,

372
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,513
and we'll see to the government
of the country.

373
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,276
Nan, it's a cruel thing to be
near a woman day after day,

374
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,029
to touch her when you wanted to,
to have her company when you asked it

375
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,878
and to have no response.

376
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,310
To burn with love as I do for you

377
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,592
and be denied any pleasure
in your cool company.

378
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,679
It is a cruel thing, Nan,
to be denied love.

379
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,396
The same cruel thing has happened to me.
I’ve fallen in love.

380
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,160
- Nan!
- But not with you.

381
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,517
My God. I got it right in the face
that time. Percy, is it?

382
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,756
You know.
You had Wolsey send him away.

383
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,110
- That blundering...
- I mean to marry him.

384
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,630
- Never!
- But not as my sister is married.

385
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,674
He won't be a complacent husband
and I shall not be accessible to you.

386
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,668
All wives are accessible.
Any husband can be placated.

387
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,440
Then you have nothing to fear.
Let me marry him.

388
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,596
No! I want you all to myself!

389
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,711
Nan. Nan.

390
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,913
If you give yourself to me
this whole kingdom will turn around you.

391
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,351
Whatever you wanted for anyone.
knighthoods, revenues,

392
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,028
you shall dispose of them
exactly as you please.

393
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,677
And be thrown out in the end? What great
revenues does my sister dispose of?

394
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,714
Well, Mary asked for nothing.
I won't bargain. Ask for what you want.

395
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,514
My freedom. To marry whom I love.

396
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,153
Never.

397
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,434
I’ve heard what your courtiers say
and I’ve seen what you are.

398
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,916
You're spoiled and vengeful
and bloody.

399
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,317
Your poetry is sour
and your music is worse.

400
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,229
You make love as you eat, with
a good deal of noise and no subtlety.

401
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,395
This is not safe.

402
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,115
Yes, I’ve been told it's not safe
for any of us to say no to our King.

403
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,392
That put on, kindly,
hail-fellow-well-met of yours.

404
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,718
My father's house will be pulled down,
and Northumberland's too, they tell me.

405
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,310
Well, pull them down, Your Majesty,
you are what I said.

406
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,035
There is no better way to make an end
than to raise anger in me.

407
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,633
I thank you for that. You made
a fool of me! And I’m well out of it!

408
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,430
Your Grace!

409
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,677
- You will not harm Harry Percy?
- I’ll try not.

410
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,589
Vengeful and bloody as I am,
I’ll try not!

411
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,195
[grunts]

412
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,356
- Where are you from?
- Northumberland.

413
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,075
- I’ve a message for the Lady Annee.
- You better rest. Give me the letter.

414
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,113
- Give it to no one but the Lady Annee.
- All right.

415
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,028
Harry Percy is married.

416
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,348
"Annee, my love, forgive me".

417
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,714
- The King did this.
- Not the King, Wolsey.

418
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,672
See here.

419
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,670
''I would have held out. But for your
safety, dearest Annee, I had to marry.''

420
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,670
That would be Wolsey's threat, that you
would suffer if Percy remained defiant.

421
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,477
God, I can't believe it.
The pain is so great, I want to die.

422
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,754
Pain goes, my child.
Few of us marry where our hearts lie.

423
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,556
[shouting, cheering]

424
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,595
Damn all entertainment
and damn all women!

425
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:33,591
Why must I want the one woman
who doesn't want me?

426
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,912
I’ll see her!

427
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,352
Elizabeth.

428
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,878
For God's sake make her hurry. When the
King is hungry he's in an evil temper.

429
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,036
I’ll see to this.

430
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,472
Will. Let's see what the lady Elizabeth
has decided.

431
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,753
- He's never returned to a woman.
- Lucky for all of us and your child.

432
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,077
- Henry was generous with his children.
- Learn from me, Nan.

433
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,113
Lock up your heart,
never surrender completely.

434
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,550
I shall not surrender myself at all.

435
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,991
The moment you're conquered
he'll walk away.

436
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,474
That's enough!

437
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,070
I hate him only a little less
than I hate Wolsey.

438
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,873
- Ready? Are we ready?
- Quite ready, Father.

439
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:15,319
* Farewell, farewell
My pleasure past

440
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:21,830
* Welcome my present pain

441
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,748
* Welcome the torment In my heart

442
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,877
* To see my love again

443
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:43,676
* Alone, alone
I longed for her

444
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:51,117
* While mistresses forsaking

445
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:58,832
* Now must I tell my hopes and fear

446
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:08,153
* Of love In her awaking *

447
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,509
Bravo, Your Majesty! Bravo!

448
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,234
Bravo, Majesty.

449
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,000
No other king can write as you do,
Your Majesty.

450
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,795
That cheers me, Elizabeth.
Someone, I forget whom,

451
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,711
said once that my music was sour
and my poetry worse.

452
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,199
That caused me great anguish. True verse
and music grow from suffering.

453
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,278
I heard it in my mind
when I woke from a troubled sleep.

454
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:55,032
I wrote it down without a correction.
It sings what is truly in my heart.

455
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,675
If some young man wrote this song
for you, Annee, what would you say of it?

456
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,429
I would ask him how his wife liked it,
Your Grace.

457
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,716
You shall dance to my tune, mistress.

458
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,034
The Basse dance I composed.
Play. Be merry. Dance.

459
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,834
Annee, why do you taunt me?

460
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,190
Percy is married, Your Majesty.

461
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,073
- None of my doing.
- I see.

462
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,192
Wolsey is King of England, is he?

463
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,630
That's enough. I am the King.

464
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,957
If you dare to treat me like
a bawling boy in front of my court,

465
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,628
- I’ll tear this castle down.
- Do so.

466
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,958
Annee, even a king cAnneot choose
where he will love.

467
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,712
I want no one in this kingdom but you.
That's why I’ve returned.

468
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,990
You are not free to love,
you have a wife.

469
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,919
If a man is married, king or commoner,
he is not free.

470
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,793
I never married Catherine.
England married Spain.

471
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,278
My father coupled my brother Arthur
with Catherine for the Spanish Alliance.

472
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,031
Arthur died and I became heir, so it was
decided that I, in my turn, should...

473
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,597
...marry my dead brother's widow.

474
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,678
I was 17 and she 23.

475
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:56,032
So England and Spain married,
not Henry and Catherine.

476
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:07,318
There's a...
There's a curse on that marriage.

477
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,318
All my sons were born dead.

478
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,718
For 20 years I’ve had dead sons.

479
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:21,398
Now she's past the age
of bearing children.

480
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,878
What has this barren marriage
to do with you and me?

481
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,278
You cAnneot touch my heart.
You cAnneot bribe me with favours.

482
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,031
The only love I will give you is the
love of a loyal subject for her king.

483
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,356
Very well then.

484
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,276
As your King,

485
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,519
I command you to return with me
to the court.

486
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,355
I command you to be
lady-in-waiting to my wife,

487
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,870
Catherine the Queen.

488
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,789
You will be in my presence
every day of your life.

489
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,915
Then we shall see.

490
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,951
- Was he shouting for me?
- Bellowing.

491
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,630
- How they all tremble when he bellows.
- And you?

492
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,030
Does that tremble?

493
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,548
No. But you so hated coming here
you spoke wildly.

494
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,833
- I fear you might provoke his anger.
- That was six months ago.

495
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,909
I’m still young. I love dancing
and new clothes and gifts.

496
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,990
- And power.

497
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,668
Power is as exciting as love,
I discover.

498
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,917
And who has more of it than the King?

499
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,275
The warship will be launched
from Portsmouth

500
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,153
in five days time, Your Grace.
Here is the warrant.

501
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,749
But a name is needed for the vessel.

502
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,393
The "Annee Boleyn".

503
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,876
- The ambassadors from Spain?
- Deal with them yourself.

504
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,274
She almost reigns. She entirely rules.

505
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,632
And I believe gives... nothing for it.

506
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,315
- She could prove powerful.
- Thomas, this is a man's world.

507
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,718
The seat of power does not lie
between a woman's legs.

508
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,913
Wolsey, Nan reminds me that her
father's patent of the Earl of Wiltshire

509
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,237
- has not yet been drawn.
- Indeed. It should be done at once.

510
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,589
Good. Good.

511
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,031
I must tell you, My Lord,
a game we ladies-in-waiting play.

512
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,117
A game of titles.

513
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,392
Who has the most titles in the land?

514
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:05,230
I said that, of course, His Majesty.
But another said, "No, no".

515
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,159
"The great Cardinal Wolsey
has more than the King".

516
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,990
"He is Bishop of Tournai, of Lincoln, of
Bath and Wells, Durham and Winchester".

517
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,351
"He is also Archbishop of York
and Papal Legate in England,

518
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,233
which puts him above
the Archbishop of Canterbury".

519
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,351
"Who knows?
He may one day be Pope".

520
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,028
"So he is the most powerful churchman".

521
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,190
"He is also Lord Chancellor and
therefore the most powerful layman".

522
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,790
I said, "How fortunate for His Majesty
that the good Cardinal

523
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,231
is devoted only to the King
and to England".

524
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,353
"Consider how dangerous it would be
if so powerful a man

525
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:45,030
had ambitions of his own".

526
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,794
His Sovereign,

527
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,549
I confess your royal favours
showered on me are more than I deserve.

528
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,914
I can render nothing
but my thanks, my prayers

529
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,509
and my unending loyalty.

530
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,837
And what livings would you shed
to prove your loyalty,

531
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,190
my good Vicar of Hell?

532
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,914
Any, or all, sir, at your command.

533
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,272
And your wealth, My Lord?
I believe he is richer even than you.

534
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,393
- So many livings, so many palaces.
- I wonder.

535
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,160
Such vanities mean little to me
if I may serve you.

536
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,193
Choose anything I have
and it is yours, Majesty.

537
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,551
I will. I will.

538
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,433
When I have given it some thought.

539
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,632
Thank you. Thank you, Annee.

540
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,673
My Lord, you are as generous
as you are great.

541
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,839
I shall ask the King to show me
your palace at Hampton Court.

542
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,190
Bull's-eye.

543
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,190
Come, girl, play something cheerful.

544
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,678
Men prefer women who laugh and are gay.

545
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,276
Well, what more do you want?

546
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,313
- Nothing.
- For yourself, your family and friends?

547
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,033
- Nothing.
- Liar!

548
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,949
You have a taste for power. It’s very
common. I’ve seen it many times.

549
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,469
You don't get it for nothing.
You have to pay.

550
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,356
You ordered me to court.
The power is yours, not mine.

551
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,599
I’m mad for you. I dream of you
at night. I long for you by day.

552
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,950
And you dare tell me
that I have the power?

553
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,436
I’m no good with any other woman.
I think of nothing but you,

554
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,393
of you and me playing dog and bitch,
horse and mare,

555
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,670
of you and me in every way.

556
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,715
I want to fill you up night after night.
I want to fill you up with sons.

557
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,755
Bastards. They would be bastards.

558
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,312
One word more and I’ll strike you.
One word more.

559
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,031
Without marriage, if you and I
have sons, they will be bastards.

560
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,038
Annee.

561
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,636
Forgive me. Forgive me, Annee.

562
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,318
- Who is it?
- Norfolk, with a message from the King.

563
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,750
The devil take him.

564
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,632
Bess.

565
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,277
- Bess, be gone. Come on.

566
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,869
- Out you go, out you go.
- What?

567
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,036
For form's sake.

568
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,754
- Come on, come on.

569
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,556
Enter.

570
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,035
Well?

571
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,676
The King commands that you
come at once to the Palace at Greenwich.

572
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,393
Does he, My Lord?

573
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,149
Is he ill?
Is there some urgent danger?

574
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,351
A boat is waiting.

575
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,832
Norfolk!

576
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,710
Is the tide with or against us?

577
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,435
I leave such details to the boatman
and other riffraff, My Lord.

578
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,800
You may go.

579
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,198
Enter.

580
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,588
What keeps you half the night
from getting here?

581
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,155
Your Grace, pardon me.
Tide is flooding.

582
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,591
Tell the Lady Annee the law of England,
My Holy Lord Chancellor.

583
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,509
Is it not true that I can make
legitimate whomsoever I choose?

584
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,757
- Most certainly.
- The documents can be drawn at once?

585
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,793
- Within the hour.
- So?

586
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,072
Could any child of the King's body
be made legitimate?

587
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,032
Yes.

588
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,038
And such a child would be heir
to the throne of England?

589
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,800
- Most certainly.
- Thank you. Thank you, Thomas.

590
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,719
- Take the flooding tide and go home.
- Wait.

591
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,875
Madam?

592
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:40,837
Surely such a child would be heir
to the throne after the Princess Mary,

593
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,794
daughter of the King
and his rightful Queen?

594
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,468
- Well, My Lord?
- That might be argued.

595
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,116
No. Let us have it clearly.

596
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,551
Princess Mary is first in line

597
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,673
against any son His Majesty
may father out of wedlock.

598
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:05,958
After Mary comes the Duke of Richmond,
his bastard by Bessie Blount.

599
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,595
Can you deny that he would inherit
if she died?

600
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,952
Richmond? Oh, he's a sickly fellow.
I doubt if he'll live out the year.

601
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,994
Then my sister's child by the King.

602
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:22,034
We're affectionate, Mary and I,
and forgive each other little things,

603
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,869
but if she would rather her son
sat on the throne than mine,

604
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,389
I would rather mine than hers.

605
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:33,071
And so mine, you must agree,
would be fourth in the lists.

606
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,192
Who knows, madam,
you may not be capable of a son.

607
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,392
I’ll give the man that marries me
a houseful of lusty sons.

608
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,513
Marriage.

609
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,756
If I were free of Catherine...

610
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,996
You cAnneot be free of Catherine.

611
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,478
- If I were...
- It is impossible.

612
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,989
For the last time,
if I were free of Catherine

613
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,556
and made you the Queen of England,
would you marry me?

614
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,518
Yes.

615
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:07,429
If you make me Queen of England,
I’ll marry you...

616
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,473
...and give you sons.

617
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,231
Meanwhile...

618
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,310
I’ll go alone to my bed,
with Your Gracious leave.

619
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,673
- Brilliant, Your Grace. Brilliant.
- You think so?

620
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,078
Yes. Keep promising her marriage
and the siege will soon be over.

621
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,556
- In a month you'll have breached her.
- You think I was lying?

622
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,309
If wooing, praise,
gifts and power have failed

623
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,557
then you must try a new strategy.

624
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:53,277
When I go down on my hunkers and pray,
good Cardinal, as I do day in, day out,

625
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,278
there's only one thing I pray.

626
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,679
Show me how to save England
from chaos when I’m dead.

627
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:07,637
That prayer has just been answered.
I shall remarry and have a son.

628
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,799
- Divorce? Catherine?
- Anneulment.

629
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,912
My marriage is cursed
and my sons born dead

630
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,669
because I’ve transgressed God's Law
in marrying my brother's wife.

631
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,759
It was incest and I’ve been punished.
I was never married in the eyes of God.

632
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,713
Indeed you were, My Lord.
Thoroughly married.

633
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,708
The Pope granted you a dispensation
to marry Catherine when Arthur died.

634
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,354
Because England and Spain
needed one another.

635
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,996
Because your brother was 15
and had not consummated the marriage.

636
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,873
At 15, I was rogering maids
right, left and centre.

637
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:42,993
At the time I believed, and the Pope
believed, and my father chose to believe

638
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,156
that Catherine was virgin.

639
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,909
I was deceived.
The marriage was consummated.

640
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,793
Prepare the evidence.
Get me a case for Anneulment.

641
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,313
My Lord, I beg you, as your faithful
servant, I beg you to consider.

642
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,351
Catherine is a princess of Spain.

643
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,439
Try to Anneul your marriage and you'll
gather enormous forces against you.

644
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:08,270
Spain, Naples, Germany, the Netherlands.
All of them ruled by Catherine's nephew.

645
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,277
The Roman Catholic Church.

646
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,995
- Your own people who love the Queen.
- I will marry Annee!

647
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,112
It could mean war.
It could mean the loss of your kingdom.

648
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,629
I will marry Annee
if it breaks the Earth in two

649
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,308
and flings the two halves into the void!

650
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,993
No. I don't believe it of him.

651
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,713
I fear it is true, madam.

652
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,869
As Spanish Ambassador, it is my duty
to have... many sources of information.

653
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,839
Then it is Wolsey, not the King.

654
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,476
That butcher's cur, Wolsey,
who put it in his mind.

655
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,353
Wolsey is preparing the case
to take to Rome.

656
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,832
Enter.

657
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,759
The King is here.
He wishes to see Your Majesty.

658
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:10,112
I will do all in my power to aid you.
I will send word today to your nephew.

659
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,471
- Yes and to His Holiness.
- This Pope bends to the wind.

660
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,319
Your hope lies in your nephew.

661
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,229
- Your Majesty.
- My Lord Ambassador.

662
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:44,115
It delights my heart to see you
privately after so many months, My Lord.

663
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,274
Sit, Kate. Sit.

664
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,799
Kate,

665
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,676
I’ll come bluntly to the point.

666
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:06,671
God tells me that our marriage is a sin.
My conscience is deeply troubled.

667
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:13,115
Incest will be punished and we
have been punished with dead sons.

668
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,676
Our daughter, Mary,
is alive and well, Henry.

669
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,440
Our marriage must be Anneulled.

670
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:24,350
Then it is true.
Wolsey has brought you to this.

671
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,393
Kate.

672
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:33,751
- Kate, it's God's will.
- My conscience is clear.

673
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:40,437
Help me, for both our sakes.
Support me in my case to the Pope.

674
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,713
But I’m your wife.

675
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:47,391
Do you believe I can ask Pope Clement
to tell the world that my father lied?

676
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,238
My mother lied?

677
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,318
Ferdinand and Isabella,
the most christian princes,

678
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,593
that each of them lied that my marriage
to your brother was never consummated?

679
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,109
Your own father signed the paper
with them.

680
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,393
God knows he lied like a Trojan,
in season and out.

681
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,754
I’ve had little happiness in my life.

682
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,279
I was a lonely girl,

683
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,837
brought from Spain at 15
to be used for English politics.

684
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,318
When Arthur died I was pushed aside
and kept here for seven years

685
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,988
until I could be used for you.

686
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,839
And you, I loved.

687
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,430
With you I had my only happiness.

688
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,718
I love you still.

689
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,070
Then do as I ask!

690
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,434
No. I will not betray our daughter.

691
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,075
Our daughter is a threat,

692
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,191
not a blessing.

693
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,511
I must...

694
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,552
I must have a son!

695
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,194
Get one then,
from one of your women!

696
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,913
I’m your wife and your Queen.

697
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:02,636
And neither your nor the Pope
can make my child a bastard!

698
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,359
If you defy me,
I’ll have you sent from the court.

699
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,154
You shall be shut away in the country.

700
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:17,310
It’s you then, and not Wolsey,
who really wants this thing.

701
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,555
I will have it!

702
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:25,791
I too gave evidence that my marriage
to Arthur was never consummated.

703
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,390
Did I lie to the Pope
all those years ago?

704
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,909
Did I lie to God?

705
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,192
Did I lie to you?

706
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,159
No.

707
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,311
I will live and I will die your wife.

708
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,393
And your Queen.

709
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:36,278
As soon as I reach Rome, I shall
send dispatches back via Holland.

710
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,040
See that messengers are there.

711
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,837
Not long.

712
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,554
Not long to wait now, Nan.

713
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,034
I shall believe it
on the day it happens.

714
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,316
Your Grace.

715
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:10,593
Yes?

716
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:15,278
The Spanish Emperor
has captured the Vatican.

717
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,438
- Captured the Vatican?
- Rome is sacked.

718
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:23,236
The dead in their hundreds
lie unburied in the streets.

719
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,793
- And the Pope?
- Is besieged.

720
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,955
What...?

721
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,357
By your gracious permission,
in private.

722
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,710
[courtiers gasp and mutter]

723
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,275
Well?

724
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,029
The Pope had fled from the Vatican
to the town of Orvieto.

725
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,754
- We exchanged letters.
- Yes and the Anneulment?

726
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,554
- He refuses to Anneul your marriage.
- He cAnneot!

727
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,320
- He cAnneot do anything else.
- What's his reason?

728
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,875
The Spanish Emperor's
got him by the nose.

729
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:00,631
The Pope won't offend that Emperor
by Anneulling his aunt's marriage to you.

730
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:04,954
Poor Henry.

731
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,515
He shall, by God Almighty.
I say he shall!

732
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,632
And to hell with the Spanish Emperor.

733
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,475
- Sir Thomas.
- My Lord Bishop.

734
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,672
Shall you in your conscience
accept the Anneulment

735
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,030
if the decision is for the King?

736
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,515
The Pope has answered the King's appeal

737
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,474
and has sent Cardinal Campeggio
to try this case.

738
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,559
Campeggio speaks for His Holiness.
I will accept that.

739
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,275
I shall speak against it
while I have breath.

740
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,631
I shall be silent
until I am forced to speak.

741
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,553
Well, I’m an old man and have no family.

742
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,638
At my age a good death is better
than a bad conscience.

743
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:27,718
Well, you will be the mother and father

744
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,276
and I shall be the uncle
of a queen next week.

745
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:35,268
- God be praised.
- I wonder what Annee is thinking.

746
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,870
Out there are my bishops,
my courtiers and my loyal subjects.

747
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,036
Campeggio is not your subject.

748
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,629
But I am, Your Majesty.

749
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,912
And I promise you the verdict.

750
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,837
You shall see, Annee.
Wolsey has never failed me yet.

751
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:00,033
Pray silence for His Grace,
the Lord Cardinal of York.

752
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,232
Our commission from Rome
having been publicly read,

753
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,637
this inquiry will now proceed.

754
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:11,231
Henry, King of England,
come into court.

755
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,510
Here, my lords.

756
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:44,711
Catherine, Queen of England,
come into court.

757
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,234
On. On.

758
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,556
What can I do
if the Queen will not appear?

759
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,469
- My Lord Cardinal.
- Ecco.

760
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:03,358
The King may now proceed.

761
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:17,040
My Lords, I have come to this court
not because I wish to discard a wife,

762
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,118
but because such grave doubts
are cast upon my marriage

763
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,710
and such grave fears
invest my conscience.

764
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:30,039
I do not wish to marry another woman
for carnal pleasure,

765
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,392
or nor for any displeasure
of the Queen's person or age.

766
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:39,515
This court has been convened
to try the validity of that marriage.

767
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,678
The bishops assembled here
have signed this document

768
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,351
declaring that the marriage is in doubt
and must be resolved by trial.

769
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,120
That is the truth,
if it please Your Highness.

770
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:53,676
No, Sir, that is not the truth.

771
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,753
- I do not give my consent.
- Wolsey.

772
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:02,033
Your memory is failing with age, Bishop.

773
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,754
We argued and in the end you agreed

774
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,918
that I should sign for you
and affix your seal.

775
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,078
My Lord, there is nothing more untrue.

776
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,748
I told you I would never
support this cause.

777
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:19,196
- Well, well, you're only one man.

778
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:20,628
Continue.

779
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:23,354
Hear the witnesses
who spoke with my brother

780
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,949
the morning after
he left the bedchamber.

781
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,711
Are we to have no evidence
but bedroom sniggering and gossip?

782
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:33,275
Get a message to the Queen.
She should be here.

783
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,436
She'll let her case go by default.

784
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:51,871
I will hear the Queen.

785
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:58,948
I will only be heard in Rome.
I appeal to Rome.

786
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,628
I appeal against all judges here.

787
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:05,753
To Rome and to God I commit my cause.

788
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,393
Catherine.

789
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,272
Catherine!

790
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,838
Proceed.

791
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,315
- I am going to adjourn.
- No, I beseech you, do not.

792
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,479
I adjourn this court.

793
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,669
- You have the power. Use it.
- Power to hear the case, Your Majesty.

794
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:55,429
- But you've heard it, hours of it.
- From Your Majesty's witnesses.

795
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:58,632
The Queen says no court in England
can be impartial.

796
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,717
She appeals directly to Rome.

797
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,036
But you are Rome come to England,
My Lord.

798
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:07,119
My hands are tied. The trial is
adjourned for the Queen's appeal.

799
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:11,757
To the Pope who fears the Queen's nephew
more than he loves the justice of God.

800
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,428
- Your Grace could be excommunicated!
- Get out!

801
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,392
Limp back to Rome.

802
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,752
Tell His Holiness I will have
the marriage Anneulled. Get out, get out.

803
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,432
Get out!

804
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:37,158
Well, My Lord Cardinal,
so much for your boastful promises.

805
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:54,756
Your Grace, forgive me.

806
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,356
Forgive me.

807
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:05,591
Go to the Queen.
Banish her from the court

808
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,678
and house her at your own expense
in some remote place.

809
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,791
Yes, Your Majesty.

810
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,229
Wolsey.

811
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:19,870
Remove yourself from my sight.
You're unfit for office.

812
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:23,240
Render up the Great Seal.

813
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:27,353
And hide, Wolsey.
Hide from my anger.

814
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,549
Go now. Go.

815
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,352
Wolsey.

816
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,391
I do not forgive you.
I spare you for your past services.

817
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,272
The business of the day is over, lawyer.

818
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:17,631
- I am a lawyer who has read the law.
- So?

819
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,434
There is a law of this land
that says it is treason

820
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,871
to acknowledge any higher authority
than the will of the King.

821
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,435
It is, I take it, the will of the King

822
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,713
that he shall divorce the Queen
and marry the Lady Annee?

823
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,114
It is.

824
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:36,074
Then the Church in England
must grant your will.

825
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:41,354
It is treasonable to say that the Pope
is a higher authority than the King...

826
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,710
...under the law.

827
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:50,316
I’ve always been a defender
of the faith and of the Church.

828
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:55,108
As matters stand,
you are but half the King.

829
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,356
To say that Rome may dictate this matter

830
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,950
is to say that Rome may dictate
the succession to the Crown.

831
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:04,709
What the King of England wants,
he should have

832
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,876
without hindrance from abroad.

833
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,992
True. It is true.

834
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:16,112
It would mean excommunication.

835
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,636
It would mean a break with Rome.

836
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:23,118
It would need only the appointment of a
new Primate of the Church in England.

837
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:25,276
He would grant the divorce.

838
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:30,600
Yes. And the penalty for those good men
who could not stomach your law?

839
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:35,430
The penalty for treason
has always been death, Your Grace.

840
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,716
You may go.

841
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,954
There is something else, Your Majesty.

842
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:56,038
Cardinal Wolsey,
through skilful manipulation,

843
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,595
has seen to it
that the monasteries of England

844
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,872
are richer than the goldmines
of the New World.

845
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:08,189
If, as you should be, you become Head
of the Church, those riches are yours.

846
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,630
You're a man without scruple, lawyer.

847
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,069
Entirely without scruple.

848
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:18,910
I learned my trade under
Cardinal Wolsey, Your Grace.

849
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,796
Are you also a pupil of the Cardinal?

850
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,639
No, no, I studied under a real master,
my father.

851
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,310
Whatever villainy was lacking
in the world when Henry VII was born,

852
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,158
he invented before he left it.

853
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,955
But the one cardinal principle
he taught me was,

854
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,913
always keep the Church on your side.

855
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:50,193
Well, you have the Church on one side
and you have me on the other.

856
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:54,793
Yes. The choice is now clear.

857
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:00,955
If I make myself Head of the Church
in England, I make you my Queen,

858
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:05,950
I make myself wealthier
than all the monarchs in Europe

859
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:11,630
and I shall be excommunicated.

860
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:15,473
Everlasting damnation.

861
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:21,630
No child of the Church shall
speak with me, feed me, shelter me.

862
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,231
And when dead,
my body shall lie without burial

863
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:29,439
and my soul...

864
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:33,189
...shall be cast into hell forever.

865
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,874
Heavenly Father,

866
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,278
what I seek is not for myself
as You know,

867
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:06,350
but for the future safety of my realm
and the greater glory of Your name.

868
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:14,149
If I weaken in my resolve,
remember I am but a man.

869
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:24,150
Give me Your heavenly strength
for my intended journey

870
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,788
and resolve my doubts.

871
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,913
My Lords,

872
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,278
I intend to bring before Parliament
matters which have concerned us greatly.

873
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:09,554
I am deeply alarmed by the increasing
influence and power in our State

874
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,149
of the Church of Rome.

875
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,716
Not content alone with misappropriation
of property and money,

876
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,469
Rome now seeks to interfere with
the laws and statutes of this realm.

877
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:23,958
In particular, the King's prerogatives
related to the succession to the throne.

878
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,913
For all these reasons
and many others known to you all

879
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:30,157
we must free ourselves
from the interference, influence

880
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:33,318
and direction of the See of Rome.

881
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:35,476
Hear, hear!

882
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:39,229
Item. The Oath of Allegiance
to the King of England sworn by you all.

883
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:43,399
Item. The Oath of Allegiance
to the Pope of Rome sworn by the Clergy.

884
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:48,230
Question. Whom do the Clergy serve?
Pope or King?

885
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:52,558
Cardinal Wolsey, the greatest Churchman
of our land is cast down.

886
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:57,794
Any bishop or priest who does not
first serve the King will follow him.

887
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,477
Parliament will be summoned
for the enactment of this bill

888
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,113
named The Act of Supremacy.

889
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:09,199
The King is declared to be supreme
in matters of the welfare of subjects,

890
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,231
both spiritual and temporal.

891
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,398
- Sire...
- My Lord Bishop, keep silent!

892
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,353
There is only one question
I will put to this Council.

893
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:20,074
No other will be tolerated or discussed.

894
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,874
Does any Lord here,
either spiritual or temporal,

895
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:26,470
deny the right of Parliament
to make this the law of the land

896
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:29,240
if Parliament so chooses?
Sir Thomas More?

897
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,671
I do not deny the right of Parliament
to enact laws.

898
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,348
Good. Good.

899
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,234
- Master Cromwell.
- My Lord Chancellor?

900
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:02,194
I regret, Master Cromwell,
that you did not heed my advice.

901
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,958
Concerning what?

902
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:08,312
You have, I believe, told the King not
what he ought to do, but what he can do.

903
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,988
Now no man in the world
can hold him.

904
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,316
The King's power must be complete.

905
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,394
And your own?

906
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,110
To serve his.

907
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:24,916
After today, I fear I must resign mine.

908
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,998
Every man to the devil his own way.

909
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:52,828
Forgive me, Your Majesty,
I had meant to be gone.

910
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,268
I fear I cAnneot rise.

911
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:02,631
Cromwell, your hand.
Get me on my feet.

912
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:16,548
It’s the habit of a lifetime to see
myself that the inventory is complete

913
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:22,232
and the keys are all ready,
all labelled for you.

914
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:26,639
I’m...
I’m sorry to see you ill.

915
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,798
Oh, no, My Lord.

916
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,437
Your Majesty has taken from my shoulders
a load that would sink a navy.

917
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:41,718
Well, I’ll leave these and be gone.

918
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:48,553
Is it... Is it for you, Mistress Annee,
the palace?

919
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,239
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.

920
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:53,637
It’s much too beautiful for an old man.
It needs youth in it.

921
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,990
There, take it.

922
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,870
I’ve been your enemy,
but I can't take it from you.

923
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,275
Then I’ll leave it.

924
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:14,793
A leggy girl and a half-grown steer.

925
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,956
What does that mean?

926
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:20,197
Some friends of yours
are waiting to see you, Your Majesty.

927
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,119
More, Fisher and Prior Houghton.
It seemed urgent.

928
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:26,073
Urgent for them.
Send them in.

929
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,151
I’ll tell them as I leave.

930
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,119
Well, the country air
will do him good at Esher.

931
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:43,194
The King will see you.

932
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:51,071
Take heed, Sir Thomas.

933
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,829
The King's passion for the lady
is blind to all reason

934
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:57,634
and past service.

935
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,833
My Lord, for your wisdom,
I am sorry to see you go.

936
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,519
The King has gone beyond me.

937
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:11,871
Through that one woman,

938
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,753
I am lost forever.

939
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:19,397
Do not neglect the King,
but see to your own safety.

940
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,709
It happens
that I have been unwell lately.

941
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:26,879
Therefore I have given up my office
and shall leave the court and go home.

942
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:31,312
There I will speak of nothing
but... domestic affairs.

943
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,069
Well, God be with you.

944
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,430
It is Pope or King,
there is no other choice.

945
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,596
For me it must be the Pope.

946
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:22,271
I must follow my conscience.
I cAnneot sign.

947
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:27,315
Though I am sorry to lose old friends,

948
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,114
you will die for it.

949
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:35,269
There are hundreds of my Order who in
good conscience cAnneot take this oath.

950
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,993
Must they all die?

951
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,590
If they insist, they will.
My cause is just.

952
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,837
The English Church cut off from Rome
is without an anchor.

953
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:47,476
The only anchor I know is the King.

954
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:51,670
The King had to choose,
so must the Clergy.

955
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,274
Well, Sir Thomas?

956
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:07,550
I have come to say goodbye, Your Grace.

957
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,797
I gave up my chain of office today
as you kindly permitted.

958
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:16,632
And when that day comes when you
have to choose, will you sign the oath?

959
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,831
I shall read the document with care

960
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:22,316
and hope that my conscience
will permit me to sign, Your Grace.

961
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,992
Goodbye... Thomas.

962
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,077
Goodbye, My Lord.

963
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,434
Goodbye, Prior John.

964
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:48,112
You leave this world of your own will...
and I am sad for it.

965
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:52,632
Your Majesty, it will go on without us.

966
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:11,793
And that is the last of them
who dare question.

967
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:16,717
The rest will die silent.

968
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,710
I think there has never been a king
who gave so much to find his way

969
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:41,275
to the heart of the woman he loved.

970
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:45,917
I have stabbed, fought and clawed my way
through tissues of the Church and State.

971
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:51,513
I’ve looted and plundered. I’ve ripped
and torn the bodies of my friends.

972
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,159
And all to come to this day.

973
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,516
And yet, not once...

974
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:04,590
Not once have you said, "I love you".

975
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,310
Now, my Nan...

976
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,795
My Nan will say it now.

977
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:15,952
Yes.

978
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,435
I do love you.

979
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,438
No.

980
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:26,633
No, that's not it.
That's not what I meant.

981
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,308
- What more do you want, My Lord?
- I don't know.

982
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,670
I don't know,
but I still don't have you.

983
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,956
Tell me, Nan,
did someone some day say to you,

984
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,594
never give in to him,
never melt to him,

985
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,395
never forget to hate him for a time,
otherwise you'll lose him?

986
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:46,957
- I’ve said it to myself.
- And do you say so still?

987
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,996
- Yes.
- I see.

988
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,518
I see.

989
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:01,711
Keep your heart, then!
Preserve your special chastity.

990
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:07,040
I’m too old to suffer the longings,
passions and frenzy of a stupid boy!

991
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:10,550
Writing poems in the night
to the cold-hearted bitch that I love

992
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,273
and tearing them up.

993
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,677
Pacing up and down in my room,
unable to sleep.

994
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:22,237
Sons you have promised me when
you are Queen, and sons I will have.

995
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,711
Sons without love if I must.

996
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:28,677
Enjoy your palace.

997
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:34,992
I will not come near you again
until the marriage day.

998
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,071
Henry!

999
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,597
I do love you.

1000
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:47,671
Henry, I love you. I love you
with all my heart. I love you.

1001
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:52,634
- Can this be true?
- I love you.

1002
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:56,992
Take me, take me now.
I want to be yours only.

1003
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,634
I’ve been yours for a long time.

1004
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:04,994
Now, you for the first time
are mine too.

1005
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:32,789
Henry.

1006
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,232
These men who were to die,
let them live.

1007
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:46,315
- It was done for you.
- I no longer care about the divorce.

1008
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:49,478
I’m so in love with you,
my darling heart.

1009
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,237
Can it be true after this long time?

1010
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:01,278
God in heaven, I do love you
with my whole heart.

1011
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:05,955
And our love will make a son
that will rule the world.

1012
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,878
Our son.

1013
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,469
A son. A son.

1014
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:14,150
With that and your love I’d be
the King I’ve always wanted to be,

1015
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:16,749
wise, generous, just, merciful.

1016
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,355
So I’ll kill no man for you.

1017
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,511
It’s like a new age.

1018
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:27,998
Wildfire in the air
and in the blood.

1019
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,831
Harry!

1020
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:13,189
The King sent for me to meet him here.

1021
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,038
Here?

1022
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:21,952
Perhaps he is jealous and testing
my faithfulness by bringing us together.

1023
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,434
Perhaps.

1024
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:27,553
- Has he reason to be jealous?
- No. Never

1025
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,833
Well, well. You're his concubine,
I have a hag for a wife.

1026
01:26:32,040 --> 01:26:35,919
Now I am to arrest Wolsey
who began it all. Cold comfort.

1027
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:39,999
- Arrest him? He's old and sick.
- I thought it was your doing.

1028
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,839
No. I’m past hating him.

1029
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,239
- Give him the warrant.
- Your Grace.

1030
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:08,514
Well, there's your first love.
The one you hated me for.

1031
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,917
- Did your heart race?
- No, you great royal fool.

1032
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:16,477
- I’m a happy man.
- And I, My Great King,

1033
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:18,511
I’m with child.

1034
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,394
Annee.

1035
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,674
Nan. Nan!

1036
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:49,872
Where is she? What keeps her?

1037
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,991
The Lady...

1038
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,555
- Begin. Begin.
- Yes.

1039
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:09,630
Your Grace, the door must be open,
that is to say, for legality.

1040
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,230
- Witnesses are required.
- Here they are. On, man, on, on.

1041
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:18,070
It’s a new fashion. Marry the one
before you divorce the other.

1042
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,157
Henry, wilt thou take Annee,
here present, to thy lawful wife

1043
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:25,272
- according to the rites of the Church?
- I will.

1044
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,790
Annee, wilt thou take Henry,
here present, to thy lawful husband

1045
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,560
according to the rites
of our Holy Mother Church?

1046
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:33,318
I will.

1047
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,637
- ''I, Henry, take thee, Annee.''
- I, Henry, take thee, Annee...

1048
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:39,559
- ''To my wedded wife.''
- To my wedded wife.

1049
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,751
''To my wedded wife,
to have and to...''

1050
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:45,077
To my wedded wife, to have and to hold,
for better, for worse,

1051
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:48,158
- in sickness and in health...
- ''Till death us do part.''

1052
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,590
and thereto I plight thee my troth.

1053
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:54,554
And after that, Nan,
you shall have bells and the crowning.

1054
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,151
Stand back. Stand back.

1055
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:08,679
- Out of the way.
- Stand back. Stand back!

1056
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,356
Here, Nan, for luck.

1057
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,710
The flowers of May.

1058
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,119
How much were they paid to cheer?

1059
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:24,198
A groat each.
A thousand between here and Westminster.

1060
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:28,029
They should've got a silver penny.
They'd have thrown caps in the air.

1061
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:30,515
God save Queen Catherine!

1062
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:33,109
We've been outbid
by the Spanish Ambassador.

1063
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,197
Whore! King's whore!

1064
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,597
Long live the Queen!

1065
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:43,634
- There's an honest fellow.
- Which queen does he mean, My Lord?

1066
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:48,077
- Whore!
- Long live the true Queen!

1067
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:49,952
Whore!

1068
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:54,119
Long live Queen Catherine! Whore!

1069
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,436
Heralds, play!

1070
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,357
- Long live Queen Catherine!
- Whore!

1071
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:38,589
Out! Out!

1072
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:41,712
The King would speak with his Queen.
Out!

1073
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,355
Come here.

1074
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:54,231
It’s a long time
since I’ve kissed a queen.

1075
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:02,118
Nan, I’ve kept
every part of the bargain.

1076
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,880
Will you be happy now?
My Queen, my woman, my...

1077
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:07,958
- Whore, the crowd said.
- Damn the Spanish Ambassador!

1078
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:10,276
You must outbid him at the christening.

1079
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:13,438
In four months when I give you a son
I want cheers of joy.

1080
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:14,993
They wont need bribes.

1081
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:18,272
It'll be the happiest day
in the history of this kingdom.

1082
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,713
Would you rape a pregnant woman?

1083
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,559
Oh, Nan. God, forgive me.

1084
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:31,638
You great royal fool!

1085
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,670
Whoa there, boy.

1086
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:45,596
Go and get her!

1087
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:50,918
- Your pardon, madam, the Queen calls.
- Is it born? A boy?

1088
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,839
It is nearly time, the midwife says.

1089
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,436
Fetch the King.

1090
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:04,669
I’ve waited 20 years for this.

1091
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,190
I shall teach him to ride,
wrestle, draw a bow.

1092
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,391
It makes a man young again
to have a son.

1093
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:12,318
Your Majesty!

1094
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,558
Your Majesty!

1095
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,955
Here comes my good news.

1096
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,156
The child is born!

1097
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:42,790
The child is perfectly formed
and in good health, Your Majesty.

1098
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:47,875
I have failed.
I have failed.

1099
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,230
God help me

1100
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:52,237
Give me privacy.

1101
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:58,638
Don't weep. Pinch your cheeks
and give them colour. Sit up and smile.

1102
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:01,229
Your are the Queen. Brazen it out.

1103
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:04,637
A girl this time, but a boy
the next time. Do you hear me?

1104
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,831
- Is she beautiful?
- Yes, she is.

1105
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:15,990
Give me the child.
Give me my daughter.

1106
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,873
Is he well? Is he strong?

1107
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:48,672
My Lord...

1108
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:53,914
Those are lungs that will out-bellow
the Spanish Ambassador. Ey, Nan?

1109
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:56,873
And the eyes. The eyes are clever.

1110
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:00,390
We'll call him Edward.
It’s a lucky name for English Kings.

1111
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:03,989
I have borne you a daughter,
Your Majesty.

1112
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,196
- A daughter?
- Yes.

1113
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:15,035
Why did no one tell me
before I entered?

1114
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:17,470
I wanted to tell you myself, Hal.

1115
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:20,799
We have a beautiful daughter.

1116
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,833
Next time, a son.

1117
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:27,439
Elizabeth.

1118
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,357
We shall call her Elizabeth.

1119
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,231
- Is the child in good health?
- Perfect, Your Majesty.

1120
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:40,793
Good.

1121
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:44,556
Well, if we can have a healthy daughter,
we can have a healthy son,

1122
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:47,832
as you say, as you... say.

1123
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:54,189
I’ll kiss you and leave you, Annee.
God bless all here.

1124
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:56,550
Will you not kiss your daughter?

1125
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,473
My daughter?

1126
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:04,799
No. When she's older.

1127
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,036
When she has a brother.

1128
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:32,556
- Still no word from the King?
- No, Your Majesty.

1129
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:37,151
- No answer even to my letter?
- Nothing, Your Majesty.

1130
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:41,148
How can he so utterly forget so much?

1131
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:44,636
He does not forget, Mother.
He just has no wish to remember.

1132
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:47,675
But rumours say that
all is not well with them.

1133
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:51,873
Still no sign of a son.
That woman is in despair, they say.

1134
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:55,914
For already my beloved father's eye
has started to wander again.

1135
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,634
Poor Hal.

1136
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,193
Poor Hal.

1137
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:05,437
- You pity him?
- Was I not his much-loved wife?

1138
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:09,677
And you are his daughter.

1139
01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:14,352
Unless he has a son of a true marriage,
you are his heir.

1140
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,871
You must be Queen.

1141
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:19,871
And remember,

1142
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,676
when I’m gone,

1143
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,556
you're first.

1144
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:31,871
Doctor! Quickly!

1145
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:17,112
Touch her and I’ll have her
sent from court.

1146
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,548
Who?

1147
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:23,356
That half-witted Seymour who is always
so tongue-tied and blushing and adoring

1148
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:25,790
- when you enter my chamber.
- She's a child.

1149
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:30,790
- But you would get a child by her.
- But not by you, except a useless girl.

1150
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:35,994
Mind your tongue or I’ll have you sent
from court to cool your temper, madam.

1151
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:57,194
Play on! Play!

1152
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:01,109
The Queen is tired, but does not wish
to spoil your pleasure.

1153
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:03,231
Play!

1154
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,197
Jane.

1155
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,788
I...
I think we shall dance well together.

1156
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:25,148
If I lead strongly,
will you softly follow?

1157
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,954
I hope so, Your Grace.

1158
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:34,238
That little sheep won't hold the
royal bull beyond the first encounter.

1159
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:41,038
I order you!

1160
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:01,438
Leave us.

1161
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,555
Where is Jane Seymour?

1162
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:14,719
Cromwell tells me when the dance was
ended, she was sent away under guard.

1163
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:17,229
She's on her way to Northumberland.

1164
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:22,389
As far away as I could send her,
since we don't own Scotland.

1165
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:28,952
She has the face of a simpering sheep,
and the mAnneers. But not the morals.

1166
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:31,993
I don't want her near me.

1167
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:35,476
- You will bring her back!
- I think not!

1168
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,596
If you want her near you, find a place
for her in your palace at Whitehall.

1169
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:46,430
Whilst I am here,
Jane Seymour must lie elsewhere.

1170
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:55,748
Tell her.

1171
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:05,438
Your Majesty, the people say
that you are the witch Queen.

1172
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:07,437
Are we ruled by superstition?

1173
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:10,473
Catherine still lives
in the heart of the people.

1174
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:14,958
The people say that her daughter
is the heir and yours the bastard.

1175
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:16,718
I do not fear the people.

1176
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:21,277
The people hate you, madam,
for displacing Queen Catherine

1177
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:24,870
and tearing the King
away from the true Church.

1178
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,674
As they hate me
for despoiling the monasteries.

1179
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:30,872
But the King, they truly love.

1180
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:35,198
You and I, madam,
live in the protection of the King.

1181
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,674
So?

1182
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:41,149
So in Parliament,
which speaks for the people,

1183
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:44,830
there is a bill.
It is called the Act of Succession.

1184
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,315
It makes your daughter the heir

1185
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:50,432
and Catherine's daughter, Mary,
illegitimate.

1186
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:57,352
If the King does not wish it, the
Act of Succession will not be passed.

1187
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,630
Would you sacrifice
the child of our love

1188
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:03,479
to get a silly little harlot
brought back to court?

1189
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:06,399
One daughter is much like another.

1190
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:08,909
I care not who's named bastard
when I’m dead.

1191
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:11,076
If I bring Jane Seymour back

1192
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:14,909
you will have Parliament
pass the Act of Succession?

1193
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,068
Yes.

1194
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:23,115
What a liar you are.

1195
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:30,276
What good is that Act
unless every man in the kingdom

1196
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:34,598
who has power to accept my child
as legitimate heir

1197
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:38,952
first swears an oath of fealty
to you as Head of the Church?

1198
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:42,550
And if they do not, Act of Succession
or no Act of Succession,

1199
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:46,958
they will say my child is the bastard
and there's an end!

1200
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:56,479
Go.

1201
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:18,351
Nan, if you love me, don't defy me.
Bring her back.

1202
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:20,871
I love you.

1203
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:25,232
I shall go to my grave loving you,
no doubt, and hating you.

1204
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:28,396
I will bring her back to my court

1205
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:32,673
if the oath is sworn
by all men of power, high and low.

1206
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,314
But those who refuse must die.

1207
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:39,352
- You once said they must not die.
- You once said they must.

1208
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:41,676
And now so say I.

1209
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,318
Annee.

1210
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,633
Annee.

1211
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:51,439
If you love me, forget the succession.

1212
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:54,029
If you remember how it all came about,

1213
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:59,439
how can you look me in my eyes
and say our daughter will not succeed?

1214
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:02,996
Because it would need unlimited murder.
Nan, look at me.

1215
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:06,556
Is it fitting I should be Head
of the Church, Pope and King at once,

1216
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:10,639
a farce so that so many men must die?
Could you sign the death warrants?

1217
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:14,435
I’d sign 10,000
rather than disinherit my blood!

1218
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:17,632
It’s that, or else it's my blood
and Elizabeth's.

1219
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:20,877
Cromwell knows that.
Your butcher cleaver man knows that.

1220
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:24,390
Send him to implement these details,
and let it be done quickly.

1221
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:29,276
High or low, they will sign.
I wish I were loved, but I’m not.

1222
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:34,554
And yet I am Queen of this island
and Elizabeth also shall be Queen.

1223
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:38,036
For Elizabeth, no.

1224
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:42,072
For her I will not commit murder.

1225
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:47,834
Annee, if we had a male heir,

1226
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:49,359
your son and mine...

1227
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:54,031
I can be angrier than you've seen me.
I know where your heart is, not with me.

1228
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:57,118
What has love got to do
with begetting of a king?

1229
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:59,716
I’m not young. I’m not true.

1230
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:03,549
I’m bitter. I’m envious.
I’m dangerous. I’m malicious!

1231
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:10,592
It’s your misfortune that you love me
now that I no longer love you.

1232
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:19,712
And yet, at this moment I want you
because of the anger in your face

1233
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:22,957
- and the spark of blood in your cheek.
- No.

1234
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:27,597
Annee, give me a prince
and everything would be forgotten.

1235
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:31,952
No! Not unless you kill them,
More and Houghton and Fisher

1236
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:36,790
and all who will not sign,
not unless Elizabeth is your heir!

1237
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:44,595
I’ll kill them, then.

1238
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:50,830
I rob, murder and commit sacrilege...
at your command.

1239
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:54,669
You do what you wish
and call the deed mine.

1240
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:59,715
I hate you.
I hate your desire and mine!

1241
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:29,274
I pray you, Master Kingston,
see me safe up.

1242
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,357
As for my coming down,
let me shift for myself.

1243
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:52,358
Good people, it has...

1244
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:57,234
The King's orders.
You must not be heard.

1245
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:01,597
Well, then I will not speak.

1246
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:24,678
I die the King's good servant,

1247
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:27,155
but God's first.

1248
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:37,550
No!

1249
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:40,354
No! No!

1250
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:54,913
- Well?
- A boy born dead.

1251
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,319
She has miscarried of her saviour.

1252
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:12,150
I am accursed!

1253
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:18,478
A live daughter and a dead son!
Did I accept excommunication for this?

1254
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:21,797
Did I send More, Houghton and Fisher
to their death for this?

1255
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,878
She cAnneot give me a living son!

1256
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:31,835
Very well, then.

1257
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:36,352
If she cAnneot give me a male heir,
I shall rid myself of her.

1258
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:40,071
Sir, with Catherine's death,
Annee is too firmly the Queen.

1259
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:44,910
Find a way. Find a legal way.
I will divorce Annee.

1260
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:50,193
Divorce is like killing. After the
first time, it doesn't seem difficult.

1261
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:55,918
Your Grace, we asserted English law.
Annee is now Queen by English law.

1262
01:48:56,120 --> 01:49:00,033
Indeed. Indeed.
I divorced Catherine in good faith.

1263
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:04,153
But since that time, I have discovered
an impediment to my marriage to Annee.

1264
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:08,990
I had a child by her sister Mary.
That, too, is incestuous.

1265
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:12,875
We used the incest excuse last time.
We can't make a habit of it.

1266
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:17,710
Neither Pope nor Emperor will
uphold her and the people hate her.

1267
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:22,516
She'd fight. Her sister was married. You
couldn't prove it wasn't her husband's.

1268
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:24,631
- Who do you serve?
- The King, Sir.

1269
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:27,308
Your Grace can't afford
to start all that again.

1270
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:31,593
Then do you know another way?
No, you! You tied me to her!

1271
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:35,270
Now you find a way to get rid of her!

1272
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,592
Perhaps...

1273
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:46,032
...in her own life.

1274
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:49,631
Her life?

1275
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:51,679
Yes.

1276
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:54,997
Her marriage contract with Percy.
He had her.

1277
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:57,270
That's it, you crawling toad.

1278
01:49:57,920 --> 01:50:02,277
No, Your Grace, not her past life,
the present.

1279
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:08,879
- The rumours that she has a lover.
- Annee? A lover?

1280
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:11,036
I, a cuckold?

1281
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:15,153
- Why, you're mad.
- If I could prove it?

1282
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:17,510
Invent it, you mean,
with false evidence.

1283
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:21,998
Adultery is high treason.
The penalty is death.

1284
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,318
Get out.

1285
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:35,233
Cromwell.

1286
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:39,073
It’s most kind of you
to come, Master Smeaton.

1287
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:40,599
I am honoured.

1288
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:43,633
When invited to supper,
I’m expected to sing for it.

1289
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:46,479
- As you do for the Queen?
- Oh, that is my pleasure.

1290
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:50,389
She wishes me to be the first
music teacher to the Princess.

1291
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:52,989
Please, sit.
No other guests.

1292
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:54,872
Thank you.

1293
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:04,594
Yes, for the Queen to make
the Princess your pupil,

1294
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:07,189
she must think most highly of you.

1295
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:10,437
Ah, the advantages of music.

1296
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:13,154
I did not know
that music interested you.

1297
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:14,679
It doesn't.

1298
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:19,353
I am interested in the Queen,
and you know her so well.

1299
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:21,630
Why, I’m merely a servant.

1300
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:29,231
I have the King's express orders
to protect the Queen's person.

1301
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:32,398
We have learned of threats.
Oh, many hate her.

1302
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:38,869
I am dining you, as I will dine others,
to get to know those whom I may trust.

1303
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:41,391
Oh, I see, I see.

1304
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:45,833
And it is true that she likes
to have you close to her, is it not?

1305
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:48,793
Without boasting,
I believe she prefers me to many.

1306
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,309
She prefers my style to the Italian.

1307
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,398
It is nearer to the mAnneer
she loved in the French Court.

1308
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:56,670
She learned to love
like a French woman.

1309
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:59,678
Yes, simple tunes sung with...

1310
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:05,230
You would be wiser not to laugh.

1311
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:08,637
It is a more valuable asset
than a pleasant singing voice.

1312
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:13,837
I make my way by singing. I’ve no desire
to go any further by any other route.

1313
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:15,879
Come now.

1314
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:20,631
There are only two reasons for you to be
constantly in the Queen's apartments.

1315
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:24,389
You love her,
or you are in the pay of Spain.

1316
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:30,269
- Why, I go when I am sent for.
- To love or spy? Which?

1317
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:34,352
I’m sorry...

1318
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:37,631
Which?

1319
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:42,911
You're too simple to spy,
I know that.

1320
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:46,271
- So it is love. You love her.
- No! No!

1321
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,596
You do not love your Queen?

1322
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:52,110
Well, yes, all right, I do love her.
As my Queen.

1323
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:55,039
- And she loves you.
- No, Sir, of course not.

1324
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:59,116
Barton, come out here.
Bring your papers.

1325
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:03,077
The last reply, but one.

1326
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:06,317
''Well, yes, all right, I do love her.''

1327
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:08,988
- What are you trying to make me say?
- The truth.

1328
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:12,670
- That you are the Queen's lover.
- Oh, no.

1329
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:15,917
No! No!

1330
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:18,680
- You first slept with her in February.
- I never!

1331
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:20,632
- On the 18th of February.
- No!

1332
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:26,513
Surely you remember
such an important date?

1333
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:29,792
- No!
- Come, try to remember.

1334
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:33,910
No! No! No!

1335
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:38,278
- Try!
- Yes!

1336
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:41,517
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1337
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:49,199
Anyone can walk,
but can you walk with a train?

1338
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:53,109
- Yes.
- All right, head up.

1339
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:56,471
Go on. Good!

1340
01:53:56,680 --> 01:53:58,477
Don't look round. Go on.

1341
01:53:58,680 --> 01:54:02,389
It will follow you like a kitten's tail.

1342
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:06,192
Oh, what a queen it will make some day.

1343
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:09,039
- Enter.
- Madam, the Duke of Norfolk insists...

1344
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:13,631
Uncle! This is a rare honour nowadays.

1345
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:16,588
Leave us.

1346
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,151
Nan, brace yourself, girl.

1347
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:27,113
I have a warrant for your arrest.

1348
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:31,310
For my arrest?
A poor joke.

1349
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:33,272
It’s not a joke, Annee.

1350
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:36,995
I could've let others do it,
but I felt I could do it more gently.

1351
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:40,476
But I’m the Queen.
How could I be arrested? For what?

1352
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:44,795
Adultery, it says here.
Nonsense no doubt, but there it is.

1353
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,036
Adultery? With whom?

1354
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:49,470
- Smeaton, Norris and others.

1355
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:52,797
- I thought you were serious.
- I am.

1356
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:58,120
I am to take you to the Tower.
There's to be a trial. I am to preside.

1357
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:01,551
But I’m the Queen.
My child, she's the King's heir.

1358
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,479
Leave her with your women.
Annee, you must come at once.

1359
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:06,318
Elizabeth!

1360
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:10,752
Annee.

1361
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:52,555
Down? Master Kingston,
shall I be shut in a dungeon?

1362
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:55,718
No, madam. You will be lodged
near the room where you lay

1363
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:58,309
on the night before your coronation.

1364
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:01,196
Oh, Jesus, have mercy on me.

1365
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:38,475
I am Lady Kingston, madam.
I will wait upon you.

1366
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:42,719
Will you?
Then go away. Leave me!

1367
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:44,956
I fear, madam, that she must stay.

1368
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:47,799
Every word spoken to you
or by you must be reported.

1369
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,991
Send them away, Norfolk!

1370
01:56:50,200 --> 01:56:51,519
- Leave us.
- But...

1371
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:53,358
Leave us!

1372
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:14,592
Shall I ever be allowed to walk out
and look at the sky?

1373
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:17,633
Shall I ever be free?

1374
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:31,200
Norris, Weston, his friends?

1375
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:34,119
His friends since I first met him?

1376
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:37,915
- And they are accused with me?
- Yes.

1377
01:57:38,840 --> 01:57:41,559
He is willing to kill them
to get rid of me?

1378
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:45,673
- To kill his closest friends?
- [man] Come on! The other way!

1379
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:52,552
My brother.
Why have they arrested him?

1380
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:56,877
He also is accused of being your lover.

1381
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:01,195
Incest.

1382
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:07,792
Oh, God help me. The King is mad.

1383
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,991
I am doomed.

1384
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:13,995
Your Highness,
you are accused of high treason

1385
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:17,709
in that you, being the lawfully
wedded wife of our Lord the King,

1386
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:19,512
did commit adultery.

1387
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:22,075
I ask that you answer my questions.

1388
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:26,114
By what lawful authority
am I called here?

1389
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:31,997
I am your Queen. And, as such, share the
King's immunity from arrest and trial.

1390
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:36,193
Norris, Weston, Smeaton and Brereton
were tried and condemned ten days ago.

1391
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:38,595
If they are guilty, then you are guilty.

1392
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:41,553
- Did they plead guilty?
- They were found guilty.

1393
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:44,479
They were innocent as I am innocent!

1394
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:49,959
Any man, no matter who he is,
who says the contrary is a liar!

1395
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:54,510
My Lord, the warrant of treason
was issued by direction of the King.

1396
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,915
That is sufficient to give jurisdiction,

1397
01:58:57,120 --> 01:59:01,636
however, so that there may be no
possibility of doubt as to her guilt,

1398
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:05,276
- will My Lord call the first witness?
- Call the Earl of Rochford.

1399
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,992
George Boleyn, Earl of Rochford,
come into court.

1400
01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:10,997
The Earl of Rochford.

1401
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:20,235
Read the indictment.

1402
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:23,628
George Boleyn,
you are accused of high treason,

1403
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:26,832
in that on certain days and dates,
here specified,

1404
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:30,032
you did commit adultery
with Annee, Queen of England.

1405
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:33,630
Being your own sister in the flesh,
an act of incest.

1406
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:36,070
No! Not true!

1407
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:39,033
It is not your turn to speak.

1408
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:42,118
How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?

1409
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:46,393
You are a foul liar,
and my judges are your creatures.

1410
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:53,072
Stand up, Thomas Boleyn,
Earl of Wiltshire. Come to the bar.

1411
01:59:58,360 --> 02:00:00,920
Do you recognize
these two here accused,

1412
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:05,193
known as Annee and George Boleyn,
as issue of your body?

1413
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:08,119
- I do.
- Look at them, My Lord.

1414
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:14,956
By the same mother, Elizabeth Howard,
daughter of the late Duke of Norfolk,

1415
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:18,311
and therefore full brother and sister
in the flesh

1416
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:22,433
so that their lying together
would be incest?

1417
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:25,108
- Yes.
- For which the penalty is death.

1418
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:29,233
Proper evidence will be introduced
later. Remove the prisoner.

1419
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:39,154
That's all, My Lord.

1420
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:40,918
As father of the accused,

1421
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:43,793
you are excused your duty as a judge
and may leave.

1422
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:53,836
Present your next witness.

1423
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:58,238
- Mark Smeaton, come into court.
- Mark Smeaton.

1424
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:17,709
My Lords, this man
was tried as a commoner.

1425
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:21,037
He confessed and was found guilty
of adultery with the Queen

1426
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:22,798
by a jury of his own order.

1427
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,355
He will give evidence against the Queen.

1428
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:27,915
Put your questions.

1429
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:36,792
Smeaton, did you have carnal relations
with the Queen?

1430
02:01:41,320 --> 02:01:43,834
Smeaton, did you lie with the Queen?

1431
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:48,471
No.

1432
02:01:49,640 --> 02:01:52,200
There is mercy only for those
that tell the truth.

1433
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:56,029
Three men have been found guilty
on your evidence. Was that perjury?

1434
02:01:56,240 --> 02:01:58,800
You confessed to your guilt
knowing the penalty,

1435
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:02,151
knowing, unless the King is merciful,
you will be hanged,

1436
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:06,399
cut down while you still live,
disemboweled and your heart torn out!

1437
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:09,239
The King will not be merciful
if you lie!

1438
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:13,309
- Did you have carnal relations?
- Yes!

1439
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:17,993
My Lord of Norfolk,
may I question this man?

1440
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:19,758
I have not finished.

1441
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:23,157
Justice must be seen to be done,
Master Cromwell.

1442
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:26,033
- Proceed.
- Thank you, My Lord.

1443
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:36,397
Mark, look at me.

1444
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:41,557
I know well you have been tortured,

1445
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:45,275
but tell them the truth, Mark.
Have courage.

1446
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:48,392
- It is true.
- Write that. He says it is true.

1447
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:52,070
They have promised you your life,
haven't they? If you lie for them?

1448
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:55,750
They will break the promise.
It would not be safe to leave you alive.

1449
02:02:55,960 --> 02:02:58,838
- It’s true.
- He says it is true for a third time.

1450
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:03,272
- We have our evidence.
- Poor gentle singer.

1451
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:07,314
Isn't it better, if you are to die,
that you die with the truth?

1452
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:11,399
I am guilty!
I was guilty with the Queen!

1453
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:14,592
Let me go now.
She came to my bed...

1454
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:17,109
Let me go.
She came to my bed, I swear it.

1455
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:20,915
Even when she tells him he will die
anyway, he still admits his guilt.

1456
02:03:21,120 --> 02:03:23,839
Write that. Take him out.

1457
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:26,956
No. Wait.

1458
02:03:29,160 --> 02:03:32,311
My husband, the King.

1459
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:43,315
Smeaton...

1460
02:03:44,440 --> 02:03:47,238
...how many times
did the Queen come to your bed?

1461
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:49,351
- Many times.
- When?

1462
02:03:49,560 --> 02:03:51,869
- I don't remember.
- You will remember.

1463
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:55,595
Call it to mind or you'll speak
with those who can jog your memory.

1464
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:59,076
Where did you couch with the Queen,
my wife?

1465
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:01,840
- York Place.
- That's a lie.

1466
02:04:02,040 --> 02:04:05,396
- It could never have happened there.
- No, no, it was at Windsor.

1467
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:08,831
She only went to Windsor with me.
Can you think of no better lie?

1468
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:12,510
It was many places, it was
wherever you like, whenever you like.

1469
02:04:12,720 --> 02:04:16,474
Oh, God, help me. Let me go free.
I’ll say whatever you like.

1470
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:21,231
Did Cromwell promise you your life
if you said this?

1471
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:25,115
- Answer me! Did he?
- Yes.

1472
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:31,028
He lied. Say what you like, Smeaton,
and you will not live.

1473
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:33,037
Say what you like.

1474
02:04:33,240 --> 02:04:36,755
Speak now without lying,
for it will avail you nothing.

1475
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:40,034
I am to die?

1476
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:43,312
What happened between you and the Queen?

1477
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:45,829
Between us?

1478
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:49,351
Nothing.

1479
02:04:50,120 --> 02:04:55,513
She was kind and pleasant and just.

1480
02:04:55,720 --> 02:04:57,836
I would not hurt her.

1481
02:04:58,040 --> 02:05:02,431
I lied because they have broken me
with ropes and irons

1482
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:04,358
and then promised I would go free.

1483
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,433
Take him away.

1484
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:24,351
And yet...

1485
02:05:27,160 --> 02:05:29,276
...it could be true.

1486
02:05:56,080 --> 02:05:58,719
For six years...

1487
02:06:02,920 --> 02:06:07,596
This year and this...

1488
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:09,711
...and this...

1489
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:12,150
...and this...

1490
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:16,552
...I did not love him.

1491
02:06:18,040 --> 02:06:20,156
And then I did.

1492
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:24,114
Then I was his.

1493
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:29,316
I can count the days I was his
in hundreds.

1494
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:39,473
The days we bedded.

1495
02:06:41,680 --> 02:06:43,716
Married.

1496
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:49,876
Were happy.

1497
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:55,190
Bore Elizabeth.

1498
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:00,712
Hated.

1499
02:07:04,640 --> 02:07:06,756
Lusted.

1500
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:13,558
Bore a dead child...

1501
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:19,232
...which condemned me...

1502
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,911
...to death.

1503
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:35,388
In all...

1504
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:39,837
...one thousand days.

1505
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,594
Just a thousand.

1506
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:47,392
Strange.

1507
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:52,071
And of those thousand, one,

1508
02:07:52,280 --> 02:07:55,556
when we were both in love,
only one,

1509
02:07:55,760 --> 02:08:01,153
when our loves met and overlapped
and were both mine and his.

1510
02:08:04,080 --> 02:08:08,392
And when I no longer hated him,

1511
02:08:09,720 --> 02:08:13,554
he began to hate me.

1512
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:17,230
Except for that one day.

1513
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:22,751
I’m not hungry.
Take the food and leave me.

1514
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:25,990
Nan,

1515
02:08:26,720 --> 02:08:28,472
is it true?

1516
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:33,278
Have you stepped into your own trap,
My Lord?

1517
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:40,117
Any evidence you have against me,
you yourself bought and paid for.

1518
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:44,108
- Do you now begin to believe it?
- Annee.

1519
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:48,154
Annee, the court is still in session
to decide your... verdict.

1520
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:52,353
I don't want to hear your guilt from
them, I want to hear it from your lips.

1521
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:55,120
- That I was unfaithful?
- Yes, just that.

1522
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:58,869
Were you unfaithful to me
whilst I still loved you?

1523
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:04,550
Of course, I’ll never know. Whether
you say aye or no, I shall never know.

1524
02:09:04,760 --> 02:09:08,309
You come here to make sure
whether there was truly adultery

1525
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:12,274
because that would touch
your manhood or your pride

1526
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:17,270
and even so, my heart and my eyes
are glad of you.

1527
02:09:17,480 --> 02:09:21,951
Fool of all women that I am,
I’m glad of you here.

1528
02:09:23,720 --> 02:09:25,119
Go, then.

1529
02:09:25,320 --> 02:09:29,791
Keep your pride of manhood,
you know about me now.

1530
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:34,755
Nan, is it true
that you're glad to see me?

1531
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:37,838
- Yes, it's true.
- Then, Annee,

1532
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:40,918
let's do all gently for old time's sake.

1533
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:46,319
I have no wish to harm you,
and your words have moved me deeply.

1534
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:48,750
I must be free to have a son,

1535
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:52,191
and the son must be free
to rule England when I die.

1536
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:55,676
Why must you leave a king to follow you?
Why not a queen?

1537
02:09:55,880 --> 02:10:00,032
This country has never been ruled
by a queen. It never could be.

1538
02:10:01,200 --> 02:10:05,113
We can never have a son now,
God has spoken.

1539
02:10:05,320 --> 02:10:09,233
I must have a son elsewhere.

1540
02:10:10,280 --> 02:10:13,875
And it's getting late.
I’m not as young as I was.

1541
02:10:14,080 --> 02:10:15,354
What do you want of me?

1542
02:10:15,560 --> 02:10:20,076
Agree to Anneul the marriage
and give up all rights.

1543
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:24,831
You shall go abroad and take Elizabeth
with you. You will be well cared for.

1544
02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:26,996
Please set me free.

1545
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:31,796
To marry Seymour
and make our child a bastard?

1546
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:35,950
No. No. No.

1547
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:39,550
Nan... Nan, you leave me no choice!

1548
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:43,469
Once I told you any children we had
would not be bastards.

1549
02:10:43,680 --> 02:10:46,433
You promised marriage and the Crown.

1550
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:50,713
Now you try to dance out
of your promise. Well, I won't have it!

1551
02:10:50,920 --> 02:10:56,074
We are man and wife together.
King and Queen. I keep that.

1552
02:10:56,280 --> 02:10:58,236
Take it from me as best you can.

1553
02:10:58,440 --> 02:11:02,319
Then you have decided, and so have I!

1554
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:05,758
Before you go,
perhaps you should hear one thing.

1555
02:11:06,520 --> 02:11:10,593
I lied to you.
I said ''I love you'', but I lied.

1556
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:13,837
I was untrue. Untrue with many.

1557
02:11:14,040 --> 02:11:15,837
- That is a lie.
- It is true.

1558
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:18,600
I was unfaithful to you
with all of them.

1559
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:23,191
With half your court! With soldiers
of your guard, grooms, stable hands.

1560
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:26,676
Look, for the rest of your life,
at every man that ever knew me

1561
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:29,917
and wonder if I didn't find him
a better man than you!

1562
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:33,154
You whore!

1563
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:37,399
But Elizabeth was yours.
Watch her as she grows.

1564
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:40,637
She's yours. She's a Tudor.

1565
02:11:40,840 --> 02:11:43,957
Get yourself a son on that
sweet pale girl if you can

1566
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:47,675
and hope that it will live.
But Elizabeth shall reign after you.

1567
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:51,350
Yes! Elizabeth,
child of Annee the whore

1568
02:11:51,560 --> 02:11:56,190
and Henry the bloodstained lecher,
shall be Queen.

1569
02:11:56,880 --> 02:12:00,589
You've asked for death
and you shall have it.

1570
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:02,870
So be it.

1571
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:07,073
Only what I take to my grave,
you take to yours.

1572
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:09,953
And think of this, Henry.

1573
02:12:10,160 --> 02:12:13,709
Elizabeth shall be a greater queen
than any king of yours.

1574
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:17,230
She shall rule a greater England
than you could ever have built.

1575
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:20,796
Yes! My Elizabeth shall be Queen.

1576
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:24,913
And my blood will have been well spent.

1577
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:55,039
She's lying.
She was never unfaithful to me.

1578
02:12:56,800 --> 02:13:01,191
She could. Any woman could.

1579
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:04,790
No. She lies.

1580
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:09,871
If she lies, let her die for lying.

1581
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:13,193
Let her die!

1582
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:38,873
- Is everything ready?
- Yes, My Lord. The Queen is at prayer.

1583
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:41,958
Fetch her.
The time for prayer is passed.

1584
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:54,758
- And where is the King?
- At Richmond. Out hunting.

1585
02:13:55,400 --> 02:13:57,391
Will you join him later?

1586
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:01,149
No, by God.
For me there's killing enough this day.

1587
02:14:03,880 --> 02:14:06,030
[executioner speaks French]

1588
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:40,116
Will it hurt?

1589
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:43,598
They say not, My Lady.

1590
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:47,839
The executioner from France
is an expert with the sword.

1591
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:53,596
I hear that he is good.
And I have a little neck.

1592
02:14:53,800 --> 02:14:57,190
- Oh, My Lady.
- No, Kingston. No.

1593
02:14:57,400 --> 02:15:01,154
Come, I am glad to die.

1594
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:28,955
The month is May.

1595
02:15:30,200 --> 02:15:33,829
- My Lady?
- Nothing.

1596
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:11,879
Mon Dleu! She looks at me!
Distract her!

1597
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:27,436
- Away, My Lords.
- Where to, Your Grace?

1598
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:30,670
To Mistress Seymour's.

1599
02:18:08,080 --> 02:18:13,632
Elizabeth shall be a greater
queen than any king of yours.

1600
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:18,595
She shall rule a greater England
than you could ever have built.

1601
02:18:19,400 --> 02:18:23,791
My Elizabeth shall be Queen.

1602
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:27,913
And my blood will have been well spent.

1603
02:19:19,914 --> 02:19:22,914
Vtg
