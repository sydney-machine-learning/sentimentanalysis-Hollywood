1
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:05,338
- Try it.
- I don't want to try it.

2
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,669
- Try it.
- I don't want to try it.

3
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,502
Try it. Just go<i>...</i>

4
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,305
Now breathe in through your nose.

5
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,368
Hold your breath. Now scream.

6
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,509
No. Watch.

7
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:18,976
Try it.

8
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,178
Louder.

9
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,820
Hi.

10
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,766
I want to welcome you all to the Institute.

11
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:41,102
My name is Tim,
and I'm the leader of this Marathon Group.

12
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,670
Leader's a bit strong.
Actually, I'm your guide.

13
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:48,009
As you know, we're going to try to go
24 hours without a break.

14
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,744
And we'll have two one-hour breaks
for food...

15
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,483
and, as far as sleep is concerned,
that's up to you.

16
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:58,388
There are no rules here.
If you fall asleep, you fall asleep.

17
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,323
One rule. No physical violence.

18
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,292
I mean, you might get angry with someone...

19
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,889
so please don't clobber him or her.

20
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,734
Okay? That's the only restriction.

21
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,606
We talk a lot about love
but we don't feel it a lot.

22
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:20,740
So perhaps this Marathon
will open up some doors.

23
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:24,510
So let's begin by just
introducing ourselves...

24
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,280
and stating, briefly, why you are here.

25
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,417
My name's Conrad...

26
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,316
and I'm here...

27
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,666
because I'm 64 years old,
and I want to continue to grow...

28
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,228
as a human being.

29
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:47,062
I don't know why I came here. I really don't.

30
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,303
- Why do you feel you came here?
- I just said, I don't know.

31
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:54,210
- Yeah, but why do you feel you don't know?
- Maybe I'm a little nervous.

32
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,679
We all are.

33
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,812
- Thank you.
- Okay, we'll get back to you later, Toby.

34
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,753
I guess I came here
because I'm having trouble with men.

35
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:06,656
- We'll get back to you later.
- But I can't say no to any man.

36
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,892
I'm Myrna.

37
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,766
I came because I want a better orgasm.

38
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,761
It's just not good enough.

39
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,138
I'm Bob and I'm here because...

40
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:29,270
I'm a documentary filmmaker...

41
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:33,212
and I'm here to do research
on a piece I want to do on the Institute.

42
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,948
At least, I think that's why I'm here.

43
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,022
I'm Carol.

44
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,955
I'm Bob's wife...

45
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,896
and I came because Bob came.

46
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,226
A hundred times a day...

47
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,273
you just walk by people
you know. You chat...

48
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:58,099
you nod hello,
but you don't really look at each other.

49
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,545
I want you to look at each other.

50
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,414
That's good. See the other person.

51
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,782
Good. Say hello with your eyes.

52
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,154
Try and make contact.

53
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,990
See the other person there.

54
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,032
Really, really look.

55
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,266
Just look.

56
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:28,029
And give. And don't be afraid
to express what you feel.

57
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,072
Show the other person what you feel.
Show them who you are.

58
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,282
Give of yourself. Don't be afraid.

59
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,950
And really try to make contact.

60
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,350
Really try to see.

61
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:51,352
That's good. Now show him what you feel.
Go ahead.

62
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,063
Really try.

63
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,895
And learn something
about the other person...

64
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,995
good, by just looking...

65
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,374
and giving of yourself.

66
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,707
Just look and give.

67
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:10,380
Try to really learn something
about the other person.

68
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,045
Open up.

69
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,312
That's good! Show them what you feel.

70
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,651
Don't be afraid to have fun.

71
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,554
Good.

72
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:26,161
Pound with those hands!
Think of something you don't like.

73
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,563
Good!

74
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,802
Pound! That's good.

75
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,304
Pick something you don't like.

76
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,466
Scream if you feel like it. Scream! Let it out!

77
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,807
Pound hard. Good.

78
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,247
Go ahead, scream. Let it out.

79
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,411
Scream! Scream louder.

80
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,944
I want to see ugly faces. Ugly faces.

81
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,412
Open up.

82
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:21,284
Let it out. Go ahead, cry. Good.

83
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,279
Go ahead. Beautiful.

84
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,560
It's all right.

85
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,922
I just don't know why...

86
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,728
I've never been able
to do anything for myself.

87
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,804
I think...

88
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:44,099
the reason that you feel
so helpless, Roger...

89
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,875
- is because you enjoy it.
- Carol...

90
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:52,413
don't tell Roger what you think,
tell him how you feel about him.

91
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,718
I feel...

92
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,380
sorry for him.

93
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,291
Thank you.

94
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,791
She wants to mother him.
She loves being a mother.

95
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,028
Not necessarily, Bob.

96
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,096
No, come on, honey.

97
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,569
Bob, you feel like
getting into Carol's circle?

98
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:16,904
- No, I'm sorry. I was just commenting.
- You're dying to get in there.

99
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,374
Yeah, right, okay. Be delighted.

100
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,947
You can take my place.

101
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,886
- Thank you, Conrad.
- You're welcome, Bob.

102
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:37,126
I feel very badly about Conrad
leaving my circle.

103
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,164
You're pretty hostile.

104
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,803
I feel very badly about Conrad
leaving my circle.

105
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,801
- You want me to leave?
- How do you feel about Myrna, Bob?

106
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,466
I feel she's hostile.

107
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,704
Probably has to do
with wanting a better orgasm.

108
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,110
- You're full of crap, man.
- You're copping out.

109
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,509
- You're a hostile bitch!
- Is that how you feel?

110
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:01,779
Is it?

111
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,491
Yeah, I feel hostile.

112
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,960
Good, now you're dealing with
your feelings, you see.

113
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:14,292
- I feel you're all attacking my husband.
- Thank you, dear.

114
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,497
That won't do here.
What do you feel about me?

115
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,698
I feel sorry for you.

116
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,873
I feel...

117
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,209
that you don't...

118
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,279
share.

119
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,480
I want you to look at me.

120
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,522
Please.

121
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,530
You're pushing me again!

122
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,931
- You're making me do something.
- I'm sorry.

123
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,773
Bob, I want you to express
how you feel right now.

124
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,116
I feel guilty. I feel confused.

125
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,849
Then express it.

126
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,753
I feel I want Carol...

127
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,457
to open to me more...

128
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,885
but that I close her up...

129
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,866
if I force her to open.

130
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,867
I'm sorry.

131
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,904
I hide my feelings,
and I accuse you of hiding yours.

132
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,345
I do hide my feelings.

133
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,450
I'm afraid of you.

134
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,434
Bob, tell Carol how you feel right now.
Tell her right now.

135
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,408
I love her.

136
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,744
I love you.

137
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,841
I know.

138
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,896
I want you to help me.

139
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,729
As long as I've known you...

140
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,463
I've always been afraid to ask for your help.

141
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,471
I didn't know.

142
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:25,951
Help me.

143
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,186
He was so angry all the time.

144
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,992
Really hostile. Remember the little guy?

145
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,465
This man sat there for 20 hours...

146
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,866
hardly saying a word.

147
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,901
Pathetic little 40-year-old...

148
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,598
Jimmy Cagney type of guy.

149
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:46,276
All of a sudden he starts to cry.

150
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,038
"I'm impotent."

151
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,213
Forty years...

152
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:54,751
of his terrible secret.

153
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,648
Something broken.
Poor kid couldn't stop crying.

154
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,487
- I feel moved now just talking about it.
- It was beautiful.

155
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,019
And he was not miraculously cured.
Because it doesn't work that way.

156
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:09,591
But just being able to say it out,
to a roomful of relatively unknown people...

157
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:13,468
has got to be a way,
a beginning, to dealing with it.

158
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,098
I must say something now.

159
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,376
Which if I did not say it...

160
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,742
I would be playing games with myself,
with us.

161
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,872
What was that look before?

162
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,747
- What look?
- You know.

163
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,451
- The one to Alice, just before.
- You mean that look?

164
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,613
- I didn't see the look.
- It was a put-down look.

165
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,986
- Now, wait a minute.
- Come on.

166
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:34,617
- That wasn't a put-down look.
- No, it's okay if it was.

167
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,856
- It wasn't a put-down look.
- It's okay if it was, that's my whole...

168
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,899
- It wasn't a put-down look!
- No, that's my whole point.

169
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,434
If you just get it out, just deal with it...

170
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,936
or deal with me,
or with Carol, or with Alice...

171
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:50,169
- It was what it was. I dealt with Alice.
- But you didn't deal with Bob.

172
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,040
Come on, you didn't even see the look.

173
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:57,139
Come on, Alice. I know that look.
Bob and I do it all the time.

174
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,945
No "Oh, ho ho."

175
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,787
That's what we used to do.

176
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,585
That's what we are trying
not to do ever again.

177
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,057
Ever. To the people that we love.

178
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,491
- And we love you.
- We know. I know that.

179
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,225
We really do, you know.
We really do love you.

180
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,529
And we really do love you!

181
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,562
We love you, too.

182
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,473
But we are not always
totally honest with each other.

183
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:33,109
- Yes, we are! I have never lied to you.
- Alice, do you like my outfit?

184
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:35,981
I love it.

185
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:40,355
They don't want to know what you think,
they want to know what you feel.

186
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:41,757
I feel...

187
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:47,056
that your outfit is an important contribution
to an otherwise dull society.

188
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,192
No, Ted, don't do that. Don't do that, please.

189
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,867
How can you feel about a dress?
It's not that important.

190
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,407
It's the most important thing
in the world, this dress.

191
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,102
If you don't care about this dress...

192
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,270
you're on the way
to not caring about humanity.

193
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,041
- That's patently absurd.
- It's not<i>...</i>

194
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,879
What do you feel about...

195
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,047
- my hair?
- Your hair?

196
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:17,989
I don't want to offend you...

197
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:21,294
but the majority of my day isn't spent
in ruminating about your hair.

198
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,891
- Be honest.
- Your hair looks very good on you.

199
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,994
- You're full of crap.
- Cop out.

200
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:29,598
- That's what we call a cop-out.
- Yeah. That's a cop-out.

201
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,265
Can't you feel?

202
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,969
How do you feel about it?

203
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,913
Okay. I feel it's a little long.

204
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,685
- That's beautiful.
- That's great. You're starting<i>...</i>

205
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:44,518
He's starting to open up right away.
As soon as you begin to deal with things.

206
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,388
What you really feel
is that my hair is ridiculously long...

207
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,949
and that I'm a middle-aged guy...

208
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,154
trying to look like
a young hippie or something.

209
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,892
Okay. I think your hair looks ridiculous.

210
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,763
- It's silly.
- That's gorgeous, man.

211
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:59,600
- The truth is always beautiful.
- That's great.

212
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,968
- That's good?
- That's beautiful.

213
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,097
You like that?

214
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,266
- It's beautiful.
- Marvelous.

215
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,537
The truth is always beautiful.

216
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,316
Here, give me your hand.
Put your hand up here. On top of hers.

217
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,146
Here, give me your hand.
Put your hand up here. On top of hers.

218
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,015
I feel very close to you now.

219
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:25,324
I feel so moved, so full of love.

220
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,865
Thank you.
And I hope everything was satisfactory.

221
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:37,097
- Do you really, Emilio?
- I beg your pardon, Mrs. Sanders?

222
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,509
I mean, do you really hope and feel...

223
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:44,208
that you wish the service was satisfactory?
Is that what you really feel?

224
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,877
There was nothing wrong with the dinner?
My service?

225
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:47,976
Honey.

226
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,146
Darling, what am I doing?
No. Of course not.

227
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,191
Your service was marvelous,
and the dinner was great.

228
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,421
It's just that we were talking about
the fact that people...

229
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,258
very seldom talk to each other.

230
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,527
I mean, I have been coming in here
for a long time...

231
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,229
and I have never really talked to you.

232
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,973
- Was it the wine?
- What do you expect that poor man to do?

233
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,273
Now really, he does not know
that your life changed over the weekend.

234
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,713
Emilio, people find it very hard...

235
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,545
to tell each other the truth.

236
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,217
- Will there be anything else?
- No. Thanks, Emilio.

237
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,683
It's beautiful. Thank you.

238
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,228
It must have been some incredible weekend.

239
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,031
Excuse <i>moi.</i>

240
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,909
Emilio, I'm sorry.

241
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,350
- I've made you feel uncomfortable.
- That's all right, Mrs. Sanders.

242
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,446
No. It's not all right.

243
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:01,390
Nobody should ever make anybody
feel uncomfortable.

244
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,121
You're a nice man.

245
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:14,802
Well, honey.

246
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,608
Listen, I got an early morning.

247
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:24,871
I feel I have to say something first,
before we go. I really do.

248
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,383
- What?
- What?

249
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:33,052
This could very well bug you, Bob,
but I feel I have to say it.

250
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,856
- Ted, what do you want to say?
- Alice, I feel I have to say this!

251
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,020
Go.

252
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,460
I feel you should pay for the check.

253
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:49,631
I really felt that.
I really feel you should pay for it.

254
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,351
Thanks.

255
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,929
Gosh.

256
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:24,799
Hi.

257
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,644
- I missed you.
- And I missed you.

258
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,746
- Martini on the plane?
- Yeah, two, as a matter of fact.

259
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,154
Shall we have it here on the stairs
or wait till I unpack?

260
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:45,526
Stairs.

261
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:53,731
- How did the shooting go?
- It went well, very well indeed.

262
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:58,839
Got some great footage.
The cameraman is<i>...</i> I don't know.

263
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,209
This new guy's something else.
He's got some kind of juice going.

264
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,511
I don't really understand.
He's very involved with the material.

265
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,643
You know, a cameraman! And he's involved!

266
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:11,416
And no hostility, no envy.

267
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,056
He's got something going for him
that I wish I had.

268
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,923
You're getting there.

269
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,863
- Nutty.
- What did you buy me, Daddy?

270
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:28,770
"What did I buy you?"
Is that all I ever get when you come home?

271
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,504
That's what you get!

272
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:34,869
I got you something,
but you don't get it till tomorrow morning.

273
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,504
- Come on.
- Turn loose.

274
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,175
- Come on, darling.
- Turn loose. I need my whistle!

275
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,687
- I want to see it now!
- You can see it in the morning.

276
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,829
A tiger!

277
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,401
Darling, look at your nice toy
that Daddy got you.

278
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,907
It can bite your nose right off.
You can make it bite off an entire nose!

279
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,507
Put your hand up. Okay.

280
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,942
- Come on, you ready to do our number?
- Go to bed.

281
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,147
Nightie-night.

282
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,415
Now, you ready? There. Okay.

283
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,890
Underneath. Go on, get underneath.

284
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:24,291
Come on. Underneath. Deep down.

285
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:27,361
<i>Sayonara.</i>

286
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,228
I have a tiger in my eye!

287
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,433
Get out of my eye, tiger.

288
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,908
That tiger, it keeps going
in my eye all the time.

289
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:46,478
What did you do in San Francisco?

290
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,777
I made a movie.

291
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:51,348
Will it be on TV?

292
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:56,693
Yeah, honey, it's going to be on TV,
but it'll be a while before it's on.

293
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:58,755
I want to watch it now.

294
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,924
You can't watch it now,
because it's not ready yet to be watched.

295
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,467
When will it be finished?

296
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,265
Like always,
I have to take it to the cutting room first...

297
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,000
and put the different pieces together.

298
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:14,537
I'll whistle for you.
One whistle, and right to sleep.

299
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,545
Okay, that's all. Good night, son.

300
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,520
Tell tiger a story.

301
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:30,053
- No stories now. Go to sleep.
- Hug.

302
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,961
That's beautiful.

303
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,863
- Go to sleep.
- Nightie-night.

304
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,471
Leave the door open.

305
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,022
He can whistle.

306
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,565
You're probably tired.

307
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,370
I had an affair in San Francisco.

308
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,338
It just happened, and I owe it...

309
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:29,377
to you, and to us, to say so.

310
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,340
It was last night. When we finished up...

311
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:37,047
the soundman had brought this girl
as an assistant.

312
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,625
Blond, nice.

313
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,525
Of course, she asked for a ride home...

314
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,760
and we wound up in my hotel room...

315
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,631
and we made<i>...</i>

316
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:02,537
Affair is the wrong word.
We had intercourse.

317
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,510
That's what we had.

318
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,011
Well?

319
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:13,816
I'm not sure how I feel.

320
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,959
Now let me see.

321
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,988
How do I feel right this minute?

322
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:28,462
I feel<i>...</i>

323
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:33,736
I don't feel upset. I really don't.

324
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,282
I don't feel surprised.

325
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,485
I feel strange.

326
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,519
- I don't feel jealous.
- You must feel jealous.

327
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,121
Maybe I'm kidding myself.

328
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:57,726
I mean, maybe I'm hiding something
from myself.

329
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,233
- That's it, you're hiding.
- Let me hear it again.

330
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,134
Now what happened
when you were in San Francisco?

331
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,305
Come on, honey!
I made it with another chick.

332
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,541
- Are you in love with her?
- No, of course not.

333
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,813
- It was a purely physical thing?
- Yes, absolutely!

334
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,420
Darling, I don't see how I can feel jealous...

335
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,926
about a purely physical thing
you had with some dumb blond.

336
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:25,724
Now wait a minute. Not dumb.
She just got her master's at Berkeley.

337
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,622
- Really?
- Yeah.

338
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,290
- How old is she?
- Twenty.

339
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,933
That's the same age as my kid sister.

340
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:39,499
- You are hostile.
- Darling, I'm not!

341
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:44,244
No, I was thinking how close Amy is
to being a woman, that's all.

342
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,977
- You're playing games with me.
- I'm not!

343
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,281
Yeah, you are. Playing games.

344
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,385
Playing the emancipated woman...

345
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,720
a hip chick that doesn't care
what her husband does.

346
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,158
I care very much what you do!

347
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,092
You don't care what I do, that's obvious.

348
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,996
Otherwise you wouldn't be sitting there
on top of a volcano...

349
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,329
that wants to spew out of you,
and you won't let it.

350
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:06,268
You know what you're doing?
Trying to make me react again.

351
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:09,101
You feel guilty,
and you're trying to make me punish you.

352
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,734
I did a terrible thing. I cheated!

353
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:16,144
My darling, you did not do a terrible thing.
You told me about it.

354
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:19,115
If you hadn't have told me,
then that would have been cheating.

355
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,242
I know what cheating is.

356
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,879
Cheating is when you ball a chick
that's not your wife. That's cheating!

357
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,165
I feel...

358
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:40,300
closer to you
than I've ever felt in my whole life.

359
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,430
I feel that...

360
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:47,942
you're sharing something so personal.

361
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:54,283
I feel very moved that you trust me.

362
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,593
You didn't do anything wrong.

363
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,557
You're an attractive, beautiful man.

364
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,935
And you love your wife,
and you love your child.

365
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,798
Honey, you didn't do anything wrong.

366
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,637
And I love you.

367
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,982
What was she like?

368
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,450
- The girl.
- Very nice.

369
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,691
- Pretty?
- Yeah.

370
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:43,523
- She looked a little like Candy Bergen.
- Too bad she didn't look like Edgar Bergen.

371
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,262
You are jealous!

372
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,170
I'm joking.

373
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:51,231
I'm just making a joke.
Can't I be curious without being jealous?

374
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,543
Carol, we had sex, that's all.

375
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:58,204
Who made the first move?

376
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,647
- You know, when you<i>...</i>
- Show me.

377
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:06,354
- Come on.
- Come on.

378
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,628
Tell me what happened after that.

379
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:16,227
We wound up in my hotel room...

380
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,200
and then we started fooling around.

381
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,068
Did you undress her?

382
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:25,342
I don't remember
whether I undressed her or not.

383
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,900
You remember.

384
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,343
Yeah, I undressed her.

385
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,048
Kissing?

386
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,319
Yeah.

387
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:43,386
Good?

388
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,291
Yeah.

389
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,692
As good as me?

390
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,201
- No, you're better.
- How much?

391
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,038
A lot.

392
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:05,277
Grade me.

393
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:10,711
Better. A lot better.

394
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:21,523
Bob, I know one thing,
if I know nothing else in the world...

395
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,533
it's a beautiful world!

396
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,098
Carol, good night. Thank you.

397
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,733
- Good night.
- I love you.

398
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,470
I love you, too.

399
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:40,150
The gazpacho was astonishing.
Great meal, Carol.

400
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,788
You know, I love the Strickners,
and the Hammers...

401
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:48,519
but whenever they start to leave,
it's like a movie with 10 false endings.

402
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,960
- Sue's little boy is seeing a therapist.
- I didn't know that.

403
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,522
- Don't mention it.
- Why? It's nothing to be ashamed of.

404
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,363
I agree, but it's nothing I'd like to...

405
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,995
- What's his problem?
- He runs away from school.

406
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,869
- How old is he?
- Five and a half.

407
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,932
- I hated kindergarten.
- Where does he run to?

408
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,844
They live across the street from the school,
and he runs home.

409
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:15,279
It's great stuff.
I'm warning you now, get ready.

410
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,485
True, true.

411
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:36,832
- Hold on to it, my man.
- Is this Acapulco gold?

412
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,274
No. This is beautiful,
downtown Burbank brown.

413
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,208
It's very heavy stuff.

414
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,188
It's strong.

415
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,001
That thing just burns.
I don't know how you can...

416
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,801
- You just gotta let it happen, honey.
- I never get high.

417
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,309
- My ears are beginning to get warm.
- I never get high.

418
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,951
I am totally and completely
zonked out of my skull.

419
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,451
Did you see Norma's lipstick?

420
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,824
I mean, a little too much lipstick
is one thing...

421
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,558
- but when it's up to there.
- That's very hostile, my dear.

422
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:37,862
Listen, just remind me,
and I'll send you a demo.

423
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,596
I'll send you a groovy, peaceful demo.

424
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:46,901
And I'll wrap it in my Nehru jacket
and my peaceful beads.

425
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:50,480
And then I will groovily and peacefully...

426
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:55,417
drive your 18-year-old babysitter home
and groove her a peaceful, groovy baby.

427
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:06,094
The gazpacho was astonishing...

428
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,724
absolutely astonishing.

429
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:15,369
Astonishing.

430
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:18,272
- It is astonishing.
- Astonishing.

431
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,618
You have a case tomorrow, adorable one.

432
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,652
You are too much...

433
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:33,088
my sweet, unstoned mother of my only son,
who I love...

434
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,116
you're too much.

435
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,589
I never get high
doesn't matter how much I try.

436
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,497
Honey, you know what I think it is?

437
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,868
I really think the reason
I'm afraid is because...

438
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,401
you are an attorney
and we could get into a potful of trouble.

439
00:37:58,476 --> 00:37:59,875
Potful, pot.

440
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,410
No, really.

441
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,645
I love you anyway.

442
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,202
Sweetheart, I told you about this phobia.

443
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:27,397
Sweetheart, I told you about this phobia.

444
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:36,036
You both look so beautiful.

445
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,550
- You really do.
- How about me?

446
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:47,113
- You look very, very beautiful.
- I hope so.

447
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,258
I sense...

448
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:55,663
marital... passion.

449
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:59,560
- You sense well.
- You gonna play tennis tomorrow?

450
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,764
- I reserved a court.
- Tomorrow?

451
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,138
Junkie, come on, let's go home.

452
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,534
Come on, darling.

453
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:42,674
- See you.
- The gazpacho was gorgeous. Astonishing.

454
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,563
I love you so much.

455
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,298
I really love you.

456
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,298
I want to share something beautiful
with you.

457
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,170
Bob had an affair
when he was in San Francisco.

458
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,108
It wasn't an affair. It was just sex.

459
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,149
But he told me all about it...

460
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:27,316
and I had to share it with you,
'cause it's so beautiful.

461
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,287
I really love you.

462
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,355
I love you.

463
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,257
See you tomorrow for tennis.

464
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,903
I have such hostility for Bob
I cannot tell you.

465
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,841
I thought she was gonna
tell us she was pregnant or something.

466
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,471
How could she tell us?

467
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:53,074
"I have great news for you.
Bob just had an affair." Wow.

468
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,317
Ted, I think I'm gonna be sick.

469
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:04,787
Here.

470
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:09,230
- I have to have water for that.
- Look, we'll be home in a couple of minutes.

471
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,234
I am going to throw up!

472
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:13,225
Relax.

473
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:23,179
<i>Your order please.</i>

474
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:25,841
- A glass of water, please.
- How can I face her tomorrow?

475
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,315
We're supposed to play tennis?

476
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:29,818
<i>- Did you read the menu?</i>
- Just a glass of water.

477
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:33,983
<i>- What else would you like?</i>
- No. Look, all I want is a glass of water.

478
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:36,959
<i>We have tacos, enchiladas,</i>
<i>chili rellenos, cheeseburgers...</i>

479
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:40,258
<i>bonus burgers, hot dogs,</i>
<i>potato chips, barbeque chips.</i>

480
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,628
I'm gonna to throw up.

481
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:45,328
Look, let me have a taco
and a large glass of water.

482
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,391
<i>Anything else to drink?</i>

483
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,200
No, I just want a glass of water!
Don't you understand that?

484
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:52,071
I'm not hungry.
All I want to do is get you a glass of water.

485
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,234
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

486
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,778
Oh, my God. I'm sick. I really am. I'm sick.

487
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,987
Absolutely sick from this thing.

488
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:11,456
How could she tell us, Ted?
How she just came<i>...</i>

489
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,094
I have such hostility for Bob
I cannot tell you.

490
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,225
I feel sorry for both of them.

491
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:21,499
I feel sorry for her.
How could she live with him?

492
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:26,438
- Honey, please don't do that now.
- I'm almost finished.

493
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,138
I have a headache,
and you are shaking the whole house.

494
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,306
- What are you at now?
- 810.

495
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,873
My head won't take 500 more.
Now will you stop it?

496
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,077
- Let me go to nine.
- Please.

497
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,780
- Let me go to nine.
- Will you stop it?

498
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,418
Okay, I'm sorry.

499
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:55,867
I had the same feeling when Mother died.

500
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,681
I don't want to see them anymore.

501
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:09,048
- You don't want to see Carol?
- How am I going to face her?

502
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,178
What, we're supposed to play tennis?

503
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,452
I can understand you
being uncomfortable with Bob.

504
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:17,517
She just came right out and told us.

505
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:20,958
- We have to help them.
- How are we going to help?

506
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:25,593
- I don't know yet, but we<i>...</i>
- Yeah, you will have to help your friend Bob.

507
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:37,814
Look, hopefully it happened and it's over,
and that's all there is to it.

508
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:41,045
- You know what I think it all is?
- What?

509
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,882
Instead of her saying
that Bob had an affair...

510
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,923
and he told me, and I'm leaving him,
which is what she feels...

511
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:49,789
- Absolutely.
...she's covering it all up.

512
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:54,055
Now why Bob did it is another story.
I don't know why he told her.

513
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,723
He's probably very guilty, you know?

514
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:02,268
And in the spirit of this
whole confrontation thing, he told her.

515
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:05,765
It's not the most intelligent thing to do.

516
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,069
I wish he'd told me first.

517
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:12,982
He didn't tell you?
You didn't know anything about it at all?

518
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,541
No. I was as surprised as you were.

519
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:21,484
Do you know that you've not said one thing
about what Bob has done?

520
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:25,594
He's done a terrible thing. I agree with you.

521
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,689
He's asking for trouble.
But he wants trouble.

522
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,235
Alice, there must be 50 million men
having an affair right this second...

523
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,702
and not one of them is going to go
and tell his wife.

524
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:38,367
- And Bob has to go and tell Carol.
- The point is not that he told her.

525
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,069
The point is that he did it.

526
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:43,045
That he cheated on his wife.
That he cheated on Carol.

527
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:46,571
I agree. That's bad.
But I think you'll agree with me...

528
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,880
that if he hadn't told her
there'd be no problem.

529
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:51,978
There'd be no problem
if he hadn't done it, if he hadn't cheated!

530
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:55,082
All I'm trying to say is that
if we're examining the dumbness...

531
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:58,424
it was dumb of him to tell her.
The other thing was just physical.

532
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,191
Look, if he needs it that badly,
let him go and get it.

533
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,529
Let him go and get it. I don't know.

534
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,330
Look, thank heavens it's not my problem.

535
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,035
I am very pleased about that.

536
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,306
- Come on.
- No, I really am.

537
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,710
- It gives me a great feeling of security.
- Come on!

538
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,577
It's something I know you'd never do.

539
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,618
- Don't say it even.
- Nothing could make you do that.

540
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:23,312
Good night, dear.

541
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,219
I'm turned on enough by you.

542
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:33,088
I don't need anything else.

543
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,668
- Honey, please don't do that now.
- Come on, Alice.

544
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,830
Baby, I'm just not in the mood at all. Okay?

545
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,448
You want to watch some television?

546
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,316
- Would it bother you if I watched some?
- No, honey, you can watch it.

547
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,049
Keep it low, okay?

548
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:14,704
You want me to give you a massage?
Let me give you a massage.

549
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,400
- Honey, I don't...
- I'll give you a massage.

550
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:20,034
I just wish you wouldn't
touch me now, that's all.

551
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,010
All right.

552
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:25,179
Can you understand what happened?

553
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:29,481
- It just turns me off completely.
- You don't mind if I sleep here?

554
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,550
Now don't be silly.

555
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,024
I understand, Alice. I understand.

556
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,531
I think I'll take a walk.

557
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:46,330
Honey, no, don't.
Please, Ted, don't go for a walk.

558
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,600
I feel so nervous.

559
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,233
I have this energy in me, Alice, this excess...

560
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,643
Why don't you do your exercises?

561
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:01,307
- I'll take a walk.
- No, please. I don't want you<i>...</i>

562
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:02,852
Please don't walk.

563
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,410
- You want me to stay?
- Please stay.

564
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,353
Will you stay, please?

565
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:10,285
- I'll just stay up.
- Thank you.

566
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,419
I know, hon.

567
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:16,124
- Okay, honey?
- Yeah.

568
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,393
- Okay, honey.
- Go to sleep.

569
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,145
- Good night, Ted.
- Good night, Alice.

570
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,602
- Come on, Alice, please.
- Honey, I asked you not to.

571
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,174
Will you please stop?

572
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,109
Will you just stop it!

573
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,910
- I'm taking a walk.
- What? Don't walk, just stay!

574
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:09,817
- Make up your mind, will you?
- Is that the only option I have?

575
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:13,680
I'm still high
and I'm stimulated and aroused.

576
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,190
Don't take it out on me.

577
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:19,625
Ted, do you want me
to do something against my will?

578
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,224
Do you?

579
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:29,363
Do you want me to do something
against my will? Do you?

580
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,633
No, I don't want you to do
anything against your will.

581
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:37,544
All right, but please
don't take a walk. Okay?

582
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,101
Were you in the mood
before you found out?

583
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,807
'Cause I was in the mood then.

584
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,142
Before when, you know,
when we were in the car...

585
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:16,481
- were you in the mood then?
- Yeah, I thought we'd come home...

586
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:19,181
'Cause I was really<i>...</i>

587
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,151
I really was in the mood. I really, really<i>...</i>

588
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:29,357
Why don't we just forget
about what she told us?

589
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,071
- I know...
- Just...

590
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:39,939
I know, now,
I know that you are in the mood.

591
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,705
But honey, I'm not. Now, look.

592
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:49,912
Now do you want to do it
just like that, with no feeling on my part?

593
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,079
Yeah.

594
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,303
Go ahead, do what you want.

595
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,947
- Come on, Alice.
- Do what you have to do.

596
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,679
- I'm going to watch television.
- Here!

597
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:26,348
- Alice, you're making it very cheap!
- You pick an incredible time!

598
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,694
Maybe it is an incredible time, Alice.

599
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,892
I don't know, Alice. I just can't seem to...

600
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:43,934
- control my drives.
- Honey, I'm sorry. I really am.

601
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:48,577
- I'm so upset about Carol.
- I'm upset for both of them, Alice.

602
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,707
But I'm getting more upset for myself.

603
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:56,008
I don't know, I'm beginning to become a<i>...</i>
Never mind.

604
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:58,879
What do you mean? What are you...

605
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:00,650
I have a headache.

606
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,955
There's this incredible band
around my head, Alice.

607
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:07,292
What can I do? What do you want me to do?

608
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:08,490
Alice, just...

609
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,556
- What can I do?
- Rub the back of my neck.

610
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:13,535
- Right here?
- I have this incredible knot.

611
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,002
Is it right there?

612
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:19,173
Is that good? You poor baby.

613
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,836
You were affected by this thing, too.
You're all tense.

614
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,408
- There?
- Yeah.

615
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,216
- Is that better?
- Yes. It's better.

616
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:31,379
Okay?

617
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:34,851
- All over. Is that good?
- That feels perfect.

618
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:41,959
- I wonder if they'll get a divorce?
- I doubt it.

619
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:45,198
The thing that annoys me
more than anything else...

620
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,668
- is that she's back at that...
- Did you take your pill?

621
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:50,501
No, I'll take it later.
Why do you think she told us?

622
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:52,337
She just came right out and told us.

623
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:54,274
- I'm very excited.
- I don't...

624
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:56,539
- I don't feel that way!
- I'm gonna take a walk.

625
00:51:56,613 --> 00:52:00,606
- No, I don't wanna be left alone.
- I wish I had a dog. I'd take him for a walk.

626
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:04,313
- Let me take a walk, Alice!
- Go do whatever you want.

627
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:07,049
I don't really care what you do. Go<i>...</i>

628
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,766
Get the pills from the dresser.

629
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:25,402
Get the pills from the dresser.

630
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:38,013
Are you sure?

631
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:41,057
I wouldn't want you to do
anything against your will.

632
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:44,655
Get them.

633
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,344
What's the matter?

634
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,846
What's so funny?

635
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,887
- Alice, what's the matter?
- I'm out.

636
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:19,594
- What do you mean?
- I've no more pills.

637
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:24,396
- What do you mean, you have no more pills?
- Honey, I'm sorry. I forgot to reorder.

638
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:28,198
- You forgot to<i>...</i> How could you forget?
- Honey, I don't know, I forgot.

639
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:29,829
- You...
- I forgot.

640
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:33,967
That's the cruelest thing I've ever<i>...</i>
You forgot? You don't forget.

641
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:39,104
- Honey, I forgot to reorder...
- Okay, right, fine. It's just as well.

642
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:43,585
I understand. You know, it's really<i>...</i>
I have a case tomorrow morning.

643
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,581
- I really...
- Honey, now come on<i>...</i>

644
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,088
No, it's quite<i>...</i>

645
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:51,924
- It's quite<i>...</i> No, Alice.
- No, what? Sweetie, I didn't do it purposely.

646
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:56,329
I understand the problems that you have,
and it's just as well that<i>...</i>

647
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,493
- Baby.
- No, please, don't touch me.

648
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:01,127
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

649
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:05,170
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

650
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:09,605
<i>Happy birthday, dear Sean</i>

651
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:13,910
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

652
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,780
Now make a wish, darling. Make a wish.

653
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,983
Make a secret wish. Wish to yourself.

654
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:25,357
- Carol, you're in the way.
- I'm sorry, darling.

655
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:28,295
- Blow out the candles.
- Don't tell him, let him do it himself.

656
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:32,563
- I'm sorry, darling. Take a deep breath.
- I want to blow out, too.

657
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:36,037
No, Christopher, it's not your birthday,
it's Sean's birthday.

658
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,666
Let him blow, too. What's the big deal?

659
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,677
Why are you countermanding
everything I say? You just<i>...</i>

660
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:44,077
- I'm not countermanding...
- All right, you handle it.

661
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:46,775
- He wants to blow.
- Take a big<i>...</i>

662
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:49,785
Terrific! Good, big boy.

663
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:51,582
Don't start in front of everybody.

664
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:54,852
You mean, no one can hear us
because we're clenching our teeth?

665
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:55,948
Maria.

666
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:08,971
Bob thinks he's shooting
<i>Gone with the Wind.</i>

667
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,803
- Is that a Bell and Howell?
- I don't know.

668
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:15,173
Maybe it's a Japanese version. A Yashica.

669
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:22,449
- Carol? Can I help you with that?
- No, thanks, that's all right.

670
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:25,682
- The kids are really having a wonderful time.
- I know.

671
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,788
- What was that about?
- Honey, you know I love you.

672
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,295
I love you.

673
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:40,327
You know, I've been afraid to talk to you?
I never know when you're serious.

674
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,869
I want to open my presents.

675
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:47,205
I'll be right there, darling.
Can you take these?

676
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:50,178
Carol, I want you to know
I have been very upset.

677
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,645
I didn't know that.

678
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,251
- I'll be right back, all right?
- Okay.

679
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:03,949
I'm sorry.

680
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:06,190
Thank you.

681
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,100
You went into the voting booth...

682
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:24,044
I went in, and you understand,
I just stood there.

683
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:27,015
I chose, at that moment
to have a personal moment.

684
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,176
- You understand?
- But you didn't vote.

685
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:32,813
I wanted something more out of the day
than my particular vote...

686
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,653
could have afforded me, perhaps.
I wish you'd understand.

687
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,387
- I told her how upset I was.
- Yeah? What did she say?

688
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:40,395
- She was sorry.
- All right.

689
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:43,489
- Coming in for a tight shot.
- What do you want us to do?

690
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:47,297
You could rip her blouse off,
you know, I'd like to sell this thing.

691
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:51,807
I don't know what to do.
I can' t rip her blouse off.

692
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,664
Sorry.

693
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,504
Wonder what that was about?

694
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:29,136
Listen, we could do a tournament
with Chanel.

695
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:32,010
- They expected a thousand people.
- Everybody showed up.

696
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,241
Do we have a table?

697
00:57:33,316 --> 00:57:37,810
Yes. Phyllis Korwin's on the committee,
and she said she'd be holding a table for us.

698
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:16,984
Drinks are $2, and here's $20 worth. Okay?

699
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,266
See you later.

700
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,029
Look, there's Sammy Davis, Jr.

701
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,034
- Where?
- There's Alan Landsburg.

702
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:01,502
- Who's Alan Landsburg?
- A friend of mine.

703
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:03,099
Hi, Bob.

704
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:15,116
- That's a pretty girl.
- Who is she?

705
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:18,085
I know who she is. San Francisco.

706
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:23,553
You have good taste.

707
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:38,201
- I love you.
- I love you.

708
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:40,799
- You're both sick.
- Alice.

709
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:44,278
It's wrong! That's why<i>...</i>

710
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:56,653
All sick.

711
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:11,404
I don't know what we were talking about.

712
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:14,705
Difficulty having relationships
with your husband.

713
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,472
Yes, that's right.

714
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,374
Tell me about it.

715
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:26,983
- Yes, I don't feel like doing it. That's all.
- When did you stop enjoying it?

716
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:29,081
I just don't want to be touched.

717
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:33,461
Several weeks ago.

718
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:38,757
- I am a very happy person most of the time.
- What makes you a happy person?

719
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:41,565
What do you mean, what makes me happy?
I like my husband...

720
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:45,597
I love my child, and I love going places,
and I love our friends, and<i>...</i>

721
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,576
Yeah, I mean, I love my friends.

722
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,011
I still love them.
I mean, I love them very much.

723
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:55,983
It's just that they're just<i>...</i>
That's all on their minds, is sex. Sex.

724
01:00:56,052 --> 01:01:00,148
And sex, if it's on your mind all the time,
it can't be a very good thing, can it?

725
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,851
I mean, shouldn't it just happen?
It used to just happen.

726
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:05,359
Are you aware that, earlier, you said...

727
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:08,461
that you like your husband
and you love your child?

728
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:13,599
No, I don't remember saying that.

729
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,794
No, I don't. I mean, I love my husband.

730
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:20,001
- You do love him?
- Of course I love him!

731
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:26,178
Did I say that?

732
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:29,446
Yes. You said,
"I like my husband and I love my child."

733
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:39,455
"I like Ted."
Now that's just a figure of speech.

734
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,430
I mean, that's how you say<i>...</i> Listen.

735
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:45,624
You know, I have a child.

736
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:48,328
I have a wonderful<i>...</i>

737
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,730
My child...

738
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:54,409
wonderful, well-behaved.

739
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:57,469
I have never had a day's problem
with Jimmy.

740
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,072
Five. He's a wonderful boy.

741
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:19,627
Am I supposed to say
everything that I'm thinking about?

742
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:22,866
Jimmy saw us naked.

743
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,013
I mean, sometimes we...

744
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:35,580
walk around undressed.
We don't put clothes on...

745
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:38,119
I mean, that kind of thing
doesn't embarrass us.

746
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:41,156
I mean that when Jimmy is in the room...

747
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:43,749
or walks in the room,
and I don't have any clothes on...

748
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:46,989
I don't put clothes on
just because he walks in the room.

749
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:51,990
But I was just thinking that...

750
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:56,564
I got angry at him once.

751
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:01,204
I don't know.
I think it was because Bob and I<i>...</i>

752
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,077
Did I say Bob?

753
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:19,254
That was a Freudian slip.

754
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:20,888
Ted.

755
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,267
Ted and I.

756
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:29,596
The way you're looking at me.

757
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:35,175
Ted and I were going to have sex,
and we wanted to have sex...

758
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:42,414
and Jimmy walked into the room.

759
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:46,719
And it was daytime,
and I got nervous, so I scolded him...

760
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:49,451
for not knocking at the door
before he walked in.

761
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:53,325
He's so cute. You know how children are.
I mean, they're very curious.

762
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:02,066
He wanted to know why I had a tee-tee.

763
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:05,904
Pardon me? I don't know what a tee-tee is.

764
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:16,015
- A vagina.
- It's a pet expression of yours?

765
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:20,954
Yes, you know words, tee-tee, tinkle,
po-po, wee-wee, kee-kee, poo-poo.

766
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:23,385
I'd never heard tee-tee before.

767
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:25,689
What expression do you use
with your children?

768
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:26,955
Vagina.

769
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:39,370
I'm really very embarrassed
by this whole thing.

770
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:41,672
I don't have anything else to say.
I really don't.

771
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:45,043
When we come right up to sex,
you become embarrassed.

772
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:48,150
What am I<i>...</i> What would you like<i>...</i>
What am I supposed to say?

773
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:51,550
I have no wants.
Say what you think you'd like to say.

774
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:54,818
Do you think I need this?
Do you really think you can help me?

775
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,689
I think it'd be useful to talk some more.

776
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,920
I don't know for sure
if I can help you or not.

777
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:03,554
Do you think you can help yourself?

778
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:09,298
Ted is a very nervous man!

779
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:14,136
Now sex is very important to a man.
You know that.

780
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:17,009
It seems your time is up for today.

781
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:26,548
- Maybe I don't trust Ted?
- Let's talk about that on Thursday.

782
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:33,719
Do you think that that's a possibility?
That maybe that's what it's about?

783
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:37,766
Let's continue Thursday,
and we'll discuss it at that time.

784
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:43,763
Is it possible that I was being hostile
to Carol? Could that<i>...</i>

785
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:46,103
I don't know why it could be.
Why do you think<i>...</i>

786
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:48,871
Our hour is over.
We ought to take that up next Thursday.

787
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,345
I resented her. Why was that?

788
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:52,972
We play tennis, we<i>...</i>

789
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:56,541
Sounds like we have a lot to talk about.
Let's do it at the next meeting.

790
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,746
The same time at Tuesday.
We must stop now.

791
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:02,984
Sean! Put on your life jacket.

792
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:06,487
Jimmy! Cut it out!

793
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:12,795
Jimmy! No running around the pool.

794
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:20,136
Alice looks terrific, doesn't she?

795
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:22,677
I'm going up to San Francisco again
this weekend.

796
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:26,010
- You gonna see the blond?
- I don't know.

797
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:28,983
I thought you didn't want to know about
that kind of thing.

798
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:31,076
All right, I don't want to know.

799
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:33,851
Do me a favor. If you come back...

800
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:36,289
and you have any great news,
just don't tell Alice.

801
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:38,623
Most of the time, I just sit there.
Nothing to say.

802
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:41,959
- Something's happening. I can tell.
- Really?

803
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:47,226
I definitely do not have that animosity
towards you and Bob anymore.

804
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:50,397
- I know.
- But you know, I still think you're crazy.

805
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:52,737
That's your problem. That's your bag.

806
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:56,773
I really can't tell anymore...

807
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,542
whether it's coming out
of your mouth or hers or what.

808
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:01,480
You've never in your whole life...

809
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,576
had such prurient thoughts yourself,
is that it?

810
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,580
No, I've thought about it.

811
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:12,286
Hi, there. I couldn't help noticing you.

812
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,687
I find you absolutely
an extremely attractive man.

813
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:18,757
I would like to give you a little jump rope.

814
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:23,635
I realize, of course, that you're married,
but I promise there'll be no complications.

815
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:35,206
There's a double standard operating here,
and I'm not gonna play that game.

816
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:40,178
I am not gonna do anything
I don't want my wife to do.

817
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:41,723
And you know something?

818
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:46,387
I don't believe that you could handle it
if Carol had an affair, God forbid.

819
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:48,457
I could handle it.

820
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:52,360
Go play over there.

821
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:57,168
I've looked at other women.
I've had feelings. Alice never ever...

822
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,366
Let's play choo-choo train.

823
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:03,803
- Go play over<i>...</i>
- Choo-choo train! Let's go!

824
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:06,109
Remember when I went to New York
last year?

825
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:10,084
I had a lot of work to do.
I was there for two and a half days.

826
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:14,019
So they assigned me
one of those temporary secretaries.

827
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:15,885
And she was<i>...</i>

828
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,659
- Here's your drink, darling.
- Thank you very much.

829
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,696
- Ted, do you want one?
- No.

830
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:30,665
She was a very lovely woman.

831
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:32,967
Naomi.

832
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:36,471
You wouldn't know her.
She lives in New York.

833
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:38,570
She was divorced...

834
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:43,381
and she was earning a living,
and she was beautiful.

835
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:46,046
We were working late...

836
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,279
and there was an attraction.

837
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:51,190
You know, when a woman looks at you,
and you know. You know?

838
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:55,720
- I know.
- No, I've never ever strayed. Never.

839
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,064
We were working late.

840
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,264
We had a drink.

841
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:07,735
In my hotel room.

842
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:10,674
And I don't know how it happened...

843
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:14,181
but suddenly we were kissing.

844
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,682
And her mouth was open.

845
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:19,913
That's beautiful. See, that's a lovely thing.

846
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:23,254
Fantastic. It was really<i>...</i> It was exciting.

847
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:26,620
And I'd just spoken to Alice
a couple of minutes before...

848
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:29,789
to say hello and see
how the kids were, you know?

849
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:32,333
And I had this terrible feeling
of ambivalence...

850
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:35,302
- you know, at my pleasure.
- I don't believe it.

851
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:39,298
I couldn't go on with it!
It was so frustrating.

852
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:43,444
She wanted to go to<i>...</i>
Naomi wanted to go to bed.

853
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:47,442
How could you, man?

854
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:52,684
How can you let a moment
disappear out of your life...

855
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:55,815
that will never ever come again?
It won't come again.

856
01:09:55,891 --> 01:10:00,089
Do you realize you're here
for about 10 seconds? For Pete's sake!

857
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:04,326
- It's part of life, it's meant to be lived.
- Yeah, but I had such guilt.

858
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,063
Look at you, man,
you got the guilt anyway. Don't waste it.

859
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:58,780
<i>Hi, my name is Ted. Ted Henderson.</i>

860
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:02,552
<i>I</i>'<i>m on my way to Miami</i>
<i>for a legal convention.</i>

861
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:06,825
I'm married. I have a wonderful child.

862
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:09,798
My wife's name is Alice.

863
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,098
I've never ever strayed.

864
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:20,070
Once. Almost. With Naomi in New York.
That was<i>...</i> I almost did then.

865
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:23,541
There's no chance for us to have an affair...

866
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:26,638
but I'm just trying to seize the moment,
you know?

867
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:30,549
I know that's
an intellectual statement, but<i>...</i>

868
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,187
And there's absolutely no chance for me.

869
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:37,692
Like I said, I'm married. Alice and I
have been married for 12 years.

870
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:43,859
We feel differently about sex
than your generation.

871
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:50,097
Anyway, it's been very nice talking to you.

872
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,904
You seem like a very nice person.

873
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:56,142
<i>Well I</i>'<i>d better go now.</i>

874
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:58,975
<i>Obviously, you have no interest</i>
<i>in having any kind of...</i>

875
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:00,640
We're in Miami.

876
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:02,843
<i>... sexual encounter with me.</i>

877
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:19,362
Hi. My name is Ted. Ted Henderson.

878
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:22,700
I'm on my way to Miami
for a legal convention.

879
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:26,769
- I'll put in three frames from here.
- Yeah. Will do.

880
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:33,543
Okay. Listen, it's been a pleasure
working with you, honey.

881
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:35,515
- You're very good.
- Thank you.

882
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:37,950
If you ever want to work
in Los Angeles, let me know.

883
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,147
You catching a plane tonight?

884
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:44,585
I don't know.

885
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:47,561
Steak, baked potatoes, garlic toast, and gin?

886
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:49,730
All we need is vermouth.

887
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:54,365
I think I'll go home.

888
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:58,829
- Next time.
- Next time. Good night.

889
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:29,865
I thought you were coming back tomorrow.

890
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:35,475
Finished early.

891
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:44,953
That's a marvelous scent.
You smell wonderful.

892
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:47,452
- Thank you, darling.
- But I did miss you.

893
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:49,457
In San Francisco, honey...

894
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:52,686
in San Francisco, no scenes of any kind.

895
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:56,925
You could've.
Anything you do is all right with me.

896
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,965
I love you.

897
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:01,702
I love you.

898
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:05,096
You'd better get yourself ready...

899
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:07,267
'cause one of the great ones
is coming your way.

900
01:14:07,342 --> 01:14:09,742
- I have to tell you something.
- All right, tell me.

901
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:11,541
Look, don't open the door.

902
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:18,119
- You bought me something.
- No.

903
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:24,282
- There's someone in there.
- What, is it Sean or what?

904
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:25,684
No.

905
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,528
There's a man in there.

906
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:33,032
Doing what? What do you mean,
there's a man in there?

907
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:37,768
I'm having an affair.

908
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:40,602
- He's in there now.
- What are you talking about?

909
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:42,405
I'm having an affair!

910
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,609
What are you doing to me?

911
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:49,783
Actually, affair is the wrong word.

912
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:52,116
What do you mean?
What are you doing to me?

913
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:54,280
How can you react this way?

914
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:58,387
- Where's my child? Sean!
- He's at my mother's.

915
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:06,596
- Who's in there?
- A man.

916
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:09,398
- Who is it?
- Do you want to know his name?

917
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:12,235
Who is he? Just don't give me any names.

918
01:15:12,307 --> 01:15:14,832
Is there really somebody in there right now?
This second?

919
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:18,744
- Yes, of course. Open the door.
- I'll kill him! I'll kill the son of a bitch!

920
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:20,907
This is the man who held my face...

921
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:23,474
and said to me that
we should be open with each other?

922
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:27,955
- Everything I do, you have to do?
- I didn't do it because you did it!

923
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:29,785
Why then?

924
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:33,089
- I did it because I wanted to do it.
- Why, God almighty?

925
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:34,594
- Why?
- Because.

926
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:38,963
Because I wanted to do it.
I just wanted to see if I could do it.

927
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:41,762
Why in my house? Why in my bed?

928
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:45,598
Bob, I mean, it just seemed like
a convenient thing.

929
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:47,904
You were not going to be here.

930
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:58,043
- He's not in my pajamas, is he?
- No!

931
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:06,683
I'm sorry.

932
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:20,407
Why didn't you call me?

933
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:23,076
Why couldn't you have called me and said:

934
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:24,945
"Bob, I want to have an affair.

935
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:27,447
"Please, can I have an affair?" You call me.

936
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:29,677
Bob, I mean, I couldn't do that.

937
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:33,619
- You can't call to ask for permission.
- Yeah, it's something.

938
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:37,557
You always call me, darling.

939
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:40,388
And this time you didn't call.

940
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:43,955
- I need a drink.
- What would you like?

941
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:46,592
- You want me to get it for you, darling?
- No.

942
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,597
I have to get this out and get it dealt with.

943
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:53,630
Go and tell him to put his clothes on,
come downstairs, and have a drink with us.

944
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:55,040
I'll tell him.

945
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:02,546
That his car outside?

946
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:05,542
- Yes.
- The Chevy?

947
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,020
The Maserati.

948
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:15,159
He's afraid to come down.
He's afraid you're going to hit him.

949
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:18,757
I'm not gonna hit him! For<i>...</i>

950
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:21,999
Hit him in my house, that's beautiful.

951
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:31,305
Listen, I'm not going to hit.
There isn't going to be any hitting.

952
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:35,442
We don't do that in this house.
It's a nonviolent household.

953
01:17:35,517 --> 01:17:38,953
We don't even allow any war toys
in the house.

954
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:40,753
Sir. Hello.

955
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:50,425
He really is scared, poor guy.

956
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:53,728
Hello?

957
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:58,098
I never should have brought him here.

958
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,869
Yes, you should.
You did the right thing. You were open.

959
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:02,569
No. I didn't.

960
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:08,178
- I did the wrong thing.
- No, you did not.

961
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:11,413
You know, you don't bring them
to your own house.

962
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:15,354
Look, I didn't have your kind of courage.

963
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:18,860
I had to do it in a cheap hotel room
in San Francisco.

964
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:23,721
You brought him right into your own home.

965
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:33,102
You make me feel like a little kid.
Five years old.

966
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:35,541
Wants to have his cake and eat it...

967
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:38,468
and doesn't want anybody else to have any.

968
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:40,512
I love you.

969
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:48,387
Oh, my God.

970
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:51,685
Insight.

971
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:55,620
For the love of<i>...</i>

972
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:01,859
Lights are going on, baby, in my head.
Lights going on. Insight.

973
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:05,003
What happened?

974
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:08,338
What actually took place?
What really, actually did happen?

975
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:11,379
You had a thing with a man.

976
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,448
- Yes.
- I mean, you already had it, didn't you?

977
01:19:16,051 --> 01:19:17,985
Then. Nobody's hurt.

978
01:19:18,053 --> 01:19:19,486
- Is anybody hurt?
- No.

979
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:21,715
Physical, it was a physical thing.

980
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:24,258
- No love?
- No. None whatsoever.

981
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:30,860
What the<i>...</i> For heaven's sake.

982
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:35,330
Listen, man, you decent? I'm coming in.

983
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:40,633
Hi.

984
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:45,401
I'm Bob Sanders, Carol's husband.

985
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:48,277
And I'm not gonna hit you
or anything like that.

986
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:50,682
It's nice to know you.

987
01:19:56,324 --> 01:20:00,385
- I have seen you at the tennis courts.
- Yes, I teach tennis.

988
01:20:01,062 --> 01:20:03,553
- I'm very embarrassed.
- Listen.

989
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:06,157
Come on, now. That's
what I was trying to say.

990
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:08,794
You mustn't be embarrassed.
You mustn't feel ill at ease.

991
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:12,067
I don't want that. Please, sit down. Here.

992
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:19,876
- Would you like to have a drink?
- Yes, thank you.

993
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:22,747
Okay. Carol, could we<i>...</i>

994
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:26,115
- Wait a minute, now. What would you like?
- Pernod.

995
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:29,789
I don't think we have any Pernod.

996
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:32,053
- Scotch is fine.
- We haven't had<i>...</i> Scotch?

997
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:35,927
Yeah, sure. Listen, I got Teachers, J&B...

998
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:39,933
let's see, we've got, Cutty Sark...

999
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:42,970
I've got some 12-year-old Ballantine.

1000
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:45,131
- Ballantine would be nice.
- That's beautiful.

1001
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:47,767
Let's have a couple
of Ballantines. Mine on the rocks.

1002
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:50,311
- On the rocks with a little water.
- A little water.

1003
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:02,749
I don't think I actually,
I didn't get your name before.

1004
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:04,052
Horst.

1005
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:06,924
H-O-R-S-T.

1006
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,191
Listen, we...

1007
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:18,932
my wife and I, you know, Carol and I,
recently we had...

1008
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:22,638
a weekend experience.

1009
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:25,942
They call it<i>...</i>
It's at a place called the institute.

1010
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:28,642
I know. Carol told me about it.

1011
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:32,182
Then you know
that we've been experimenting...

1012
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:35,553
in the whole field of sexual freedom.

1013
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:37,592
- I believe in that.
- I know.

1014
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:42,262
And that's why, among other things,
I'd like to apologize for all of that...

1015
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:44,461
- shouting...
- No...

1016
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:48,127
No, I mean it. I didn't mean to,
I was caught a little off-balance.

1017
01:21:48,203 --> 01:21:50,831
I feel very uncomfortable
sitting here in your bedroom.

1018
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:53,033
Please, I don't want you to feel that way.

1019
01:21:53,108 --> 01:21:55,406
The one thing
that isn't necessary is for you to<i>...</i>

1020
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:58,071
I was just telling Horst that it really is...

1021
01:21:58,146 --> 01:22:01,604
very unnecessary for him
to feel uncomfortable, that he should be<i>...</i>

1022
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:02,877
That's good.

1023
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:06,250
- You are one hell of a guy.
- Didn't I tell you?

1024
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:07,913
I'm trying.

1025
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:12,350
You've got a lot of class.

1026
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:15,155
Thank you.

1027
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:17,025
<i>Old Hogan</i>'<i>s goat</i>

1033
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:43,723
Did you bring any?

1034
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:45,018
Any what?

1035
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:46,559
You fool!

1036
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:49,188

Look out!

1041
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:13,079
- Hello, there! How are you feeling there?
- Hello there!

1042
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:21,519
So this is the Riviera.
Where's the concert theatre?

1043
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:29,193
Freshen up?

1044
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:32,835
I have money. Good, let's go over there.

1045
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:35,205
- I'll give you some money later.
- Okay.

1046
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:39,245
- Sanders? Sanders's party?
- Right, sir.

1047
01:23:41,483 --> 01:23:45,283
We're gonna get ourselves a suite,
we're gonna do some heavy gambling.

1048
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:50,716
- How do you spell Sanders?
- S-A-N-D-E-R.

1049
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:53,718
Room 934.

1050
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:57,458
- I'll bet you $100 on 934.
- You don't bet here, you bet there.

1051
01:23:57,532 --> 01:23:59,363
I'm betting $100 on 934.

1052
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:05,769
Honey, two jackpots!

1053
01:24:10,645 --> 01:24:12,340
Wait a minute, one more.

1054
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:23,187
- We won! Do you believe this?
- Okay.

1055
01:24:23,258 --> 01:24:27,024
- Sorry, folks. We're just checking in.
- Do you believe it?

1056
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:30,930
- Honey, can we come back and play?
- Wasn't that terrific?

1057
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:36,930
You just give him a kiss for us...

1058
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:40,736
and tell him we'll bring him back
some chips, okay? Goodbye.

1059
01:24:44,846 --> 01:24:46,404
Jimmy's fine. He's terrific.

1060
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:49,143
Jimmy who? Do we have a Jimmy?

1061
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:52,448
- No, we don't have a Jimmy.
- I give you a toast...

1062
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:55,617
to Alice.

1063
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:58,688
- Why me?
- Because you're nice.

1064
01:24:59,394 --> 01:25:03,990
Here's a toast to Bob and Carol
and Ted and Alice.

1065
01:25:04,065 --> 01:25:06,625
- That's a good<i>...</i> I'll drink to us.
- That's an<i>...</i>

1066
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:09,261
Four of the grooviest people
I've ever known.

1067
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:12,131
I'm really getting drunk, you know?

1068
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:13,572
- Are you, honey?
- Crocked.

1069
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:16,371
- What time is the show?
- We've got about another half hour.

1070
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,378
- Will you fix me another drink?
- Yes, dear.

1071
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:22,177
I love Tony Bennett. You know why?

1072
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:24,548
He just sings, right there.

1073
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,678
<i>San Francisco</i>

1074
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:28,856
<i>Open your golden bird</i>

1075
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:33,351
A very interesting choice of song.

1076
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:36,124
I take it all back about the toast.
You're very bad.

1077
01:25:36,197 --> 01:25:39,792
How come I haven't heard the box score
on your last trip to San Francisco?

1078
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:43,827
Actually, the reason for that is because,
there's nothing to tell.

1079
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:47,068
You mean, you went to San Francisco
and didn't see that girl again?

1080
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:48,575
Honey, it's none of your business.

1081
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:50,577
- Bob, do you mind?
- No!

1082
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:52,772
Carol? You're sure?

1083
01:25:54,282 --> 01:25:59,049
I do not mind because, in all truth,
I must report to you that...

1084
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:02,615
that lady wasn't in San Francisco.

1085
01:26:03,124 --> 01:26:05,388
I see.

1086
01:26:10,098 --> 01:26:13,659
You really go for the nitty-gritty nowadays,
don't you, dear?

1087
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,268
- I think it's great.
- Do you?

1088
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:17,395
I do, too. I think it's marvelous. No kidding.

1089
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:19,940
I hope we'll always be honest
and open with each other.

1090
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:22,909
Really? You been getting any action
in town lately?

1091
01:26:24,812 --> 01:26:26,336
You're beautiful.

1092
01:26:26,414 --> 01:26:28,177
No action.

1093
01:26:28,249 --> 01:26:30,274
What are you, writing a gossip column?

1094
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:33,878
At least not by me, in any event or rate.

1095
01:26:35,123 --> 01:26:37,990
- What does that mean?
- Nothing, I was just joking.

1096
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:39,526
You were not.

1097
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:42,522
- Sure I was!
- No, you weren't.

1098
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:43,621
I was<i>...</i>

1099
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:46,693
What?

1100
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:49,066
You ready for some of the big stuff now?

1101
01:26:49,137 --> 01:26:51,662
- Sure.
- Come on, Alice that's enough.

1102
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:53,934
One thing I think I've learned in therapy...

1103
01:26:54,008 --> 01:26:56,476
is that I must not impose
my values on the world.

1104
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:59,911
I love my friends, no matter what they do.
Now what'd you do?

1105
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,988
I can't claim no credit for myself...

1106
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:19,059
- but Carol had an affair.
- Who?

1107
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:21,499
We don't want to know.
Don't tell us who it is.

1108
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:24,265
- I don't want to know.
- Who? Who was it?

1109
01:27:26,107 --> 01:27:27,233
Horst.

1110
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:32,471
He was very decent about it, actually.
He offered to give me tennis lessons.

1111
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:38,817
It's all right. You know? I'm very moved.

1112
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:42,379
- Really. I feel I'm sharing a very...
- I had an affair.

1113
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:46,052
...precious moment with you, you know?
That's good, honey.

1114
01:27:46,127 --> 01:27:48,288
I mean, I feel that it's right there...

1115
01:27:48,363 --> 01:27:50,923
- I had an affair.
- Honey, I said that's good.

1116
01:27:51,232 --> 01:27:54,258
I mean, you just don't come
right out and tell everybody...

1117
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:56,826
I had an affair when I was in Miami.

1118
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:14,517
I had an affair when I was in Miami, Alice.

1119
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:23,120
I met her on the airplane.

1120
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:29,427
I hired a car.

1121
01:28:29,504 --> 01:28:33,201
And we exchanged a couple of words,
and I was taking her home.

1122
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:37,339
And I did it, Alice!

1123
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:43,346
It really happened, Alice. It was fantastic.

1124
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:51,323
It was no love, Alice,
it was just the girl was totally open.

1125
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:08,801
What are you doing?

1126
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:11,106
- I'm getting undressed.
- Alice, relax.

1127
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:13,579
- Relax.
- Stop it, Alice.

1128
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:18,608
I am being honest.
I'm doing what I feel like doing.

1129
01:29:18,686 --> 01:29:20,153
What do you feel like doing?

1130
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:22,451
I feel like doing
what we came up here to do.

1131
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:25,321
- And what is that?
- Orgy. Have an orgy.

1132
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:29,556
- Alice.
- Orgy!

1133
01:29:29,964 --> 01:29:31,829
You're just getting even with Ted.

1134
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:34,561
Listen. Will you tell me
why you think we came up here?

1135
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:36,899
- To have fun!
- And what is more fun than an orgy?

1136
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:39,496
You're flipping.
Will you put your clothes on?

1137
01:29:39,574 --> 01:29:41,769
That fooling around in the car
and all that stuff.

1138
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:43,902
You don't think that was accidental,
do you?

1139
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:45,912
- Alice, darling, look.
- What?

1140
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:48,005
You're being completely psychoanalytical.

1141
01:29:48,082 --> 01:29:49,811
I have no interest in sleeping with Ted.

1142
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:51,909
I have no interest in sleeping with Carol.

1143
01:29:51,986 --> 01:29:53,544
You'd love to sleep with Carol!

1144
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:56,112
And you're dying to do it with Ted.

1145
01:29:56,624 --> 01:30:00,958
That's sick.
That is really a sick thing to say, Alice.

1146
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:04,156
- I have no interest in sleeping with Ted.
- No?

1147
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:08,492
But you slept with Horst.

1148
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:12,397
But that was an entirely different situation.

1149
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:14,941
- It was different.
- That was totally different.

1150
01:30:15,009 --> 01:30:16,533
There was no friendship there.

1151
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:18,101
- There was no love.
- Right.

1152
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:20,409
- I mean, Ted is like my family.
- Is he?

1153
01:30:20,481 --> 01:30:23,712
- We love each other. We're involved.
- We're like brother and sister.

1154
01:30:23,785 --> 01:30:25,946
- It would be incestuous.
- Cop-out!

1155
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:29,080
You're just being perverse,
I shouldn't have told you. I'm sorry.

1156
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:30,886
I had no right having an affair.

1157
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:33,119
You had every right,
just as I have the right...

1158
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:34,593
I told you because I'm guilty.

1159
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:37,290
- You enjoyed it, didn't you?
- I couldn't help myself.

1160
01:30:37,365 --> 01:30:39,629
- She was a very attractive girl.
- Listen.

1161
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:43,602
I don't want to sleep with Ted.
Bob does not want to sleep with you.

1162
01:30:43,671 --> 01:30:46,663
Wait a minute.
Bob doesn't want to sleep with me? Bob.

1163
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:48,231
- Don't be disgusting.
- Bob!

1164
01:30:48,309 --> 01:30:50,106
- Alice, don't be disgusting.
- Bob!

1165
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:51,338
Hello.

1166
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:56,739
Would you like to go to bed with me?

1167
01:30:57,652 --> 01:31:00,280
- Bob.
- Come on, Alice.

1168
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:02,585
Honey, come on.

1169
01:31:03,758 --> 01:31:05,817
You're trying to make me say something...

1170
01:31:05,893 --> 01:31:08,987
that's going to embarrass everybody,
and make you very unhappy.

1171
01:31:09,063 --> 01:31:13,932
I don't think so.
Look, never in my wildest imagination...

1172
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:17,331
in the darkest recesses of my mind<i>...</i>

1173
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:21,239
- You're the wife of my best friend.
- Forget your mind. We're not discussing it.

1174
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:23,641
- You're talking about...
- Do you want to go to bed?

1175
01:31:23,711 --> 01:31:25,508
...an imaginary situation.

1176
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,378
- Could you make love to me?
- Will you cut this out?

1177
01:31:28,449 --> 01:31:29,882
Don't cop out. Can you?

1178
01:31:29,951 --> 01:31:31,942
- I suppose I could.
- You son of a bitch!

1179
01:31:32,019 --> 01:31:34,419
Great friend!
You're a great friend to me. My friend.

1180
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:36,787
That's your husband.
He could make love to my wife.

1181
01:31:36,858 --> 01:31:39,349
Come on, she's dealing with
an imaginary situation.

1182
01:31:39,427 --> 01:31:41,725
- Cop-out!
- And I'm trying to be honest.

1183
01:31:42,396 --> 01:31:46,298
And don't tell me that you couldn't possibly
make love to Carol.

1184
01:31:46,767 --> 01:31:48,667
Absolutely not!

1185
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:52,234
- Under no condition.
- Is that a fact?

1186
01:31:52,306 --> 01:31:55,867
- You don't find Carol attractive?
- Of course I find her attractive.

1187
01:31:55,943 --> 01:31:58,377
And I love her very much, but like my sister.

1188
01:31:58,446 --> 01:32:01,244
I know you love her, man.
That's not in question here.

1189
01:32:01,315 --> 01:32:03,078
Does she turn you on?

1190
01:32:04,552 --> 01:32:07,146
Yes, in a way,
but that's because of our relationship.

1191
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:08,518
No. Forget the relationship.

1192
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:11,752
I can't forget about it.
I can't forget our relationship.

1193
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:15,694
I let a tennis pro do it, I would let you do it.
Don't you see?

1194
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:18,357
Now, just give me an answer. Yes or no?

1195
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:21,932
Insight.

1196
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:31,641
What a beautiful woman!

1197
01:32:33,848 --> 01:32:36,783
You see. You see right through us.

1198
01:32:37,251 --> 01:32:38,878
You're beautiful.

1199
01:32:39,353 --> 01:32:42,379
- You know where it's at.
- You're helping a lot.

1200
01:32:42,523 --> 01:32:46,015
No. She's right. Alice is right.

1201
01:32:46,093 --> 01:32:50,393
This is where we are at.
Now what is wrong? What is so wrong?

1202
01:32:50,464 --> 01:32:53,627
Wait a second. Carol, look,
we're a close-knit group of people.

1203
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:54,998
We see each other all the time.

1204
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:59,165
I think it's difficult enough for us
to maintain one sexual relationship at home.

1205
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:00,707
And one in Miami.

1206
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:06,179
- Carol, stop it.
- Bob, Alice is absolutely right.

1207
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,820
We have to be straight about this.

1208
01:33:16,557 --> 01:33:19,048
Now I'm beginning to feel something.

1209
01:33:20,194 --> 01:33:22,389
I'm beginning to feel excited.

1210
01:33:24,231 --> 01:33:26,426
Now do you want me to deny that?

1211
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:28,490
No.

1212
01:33:32,039 --> 01:33:34,132
What do you feel for Alice?

1213
01:33:36,711 --> 01:33:40,807
- Alice, I could go to bed with you.
- I'm not going to bed with anybody.

1214
01:33:41,048 --> 01:33:43,846
Why, Ted? Why not?

1215
01:33:44,752 --> 01:33:47,744
- I know you too well.
- Lf Bob says it's all right...

1216
01:33:47,822 --> 01:33:51,258
and Alice says it's all right,
and I say it's all right.

1217
01:33:55,863 --> 01:33:58,889
- It just seems wrong.
- It's not.

1218
01:33:58,966 --> 01:34:02,629
Look, it's just nice feelings,
it's something that we've never done before.

1219
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:05,501
It's physical fun. It's just sex.

1220
01:34:06,607 --> 01:34:08,575
Come on, it'll be fun.

1221
01:34:13,347 --> 01:34:16,248
I do feel aroused. I can't deny that.

1222
01:34:21,689 --> 01:34:26,251
- It would be purely physical.
- Purely. It would be purely physical.

1223
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,397
Come on, it'll be fun.

1224
01:34:57,591 --> 01:35:01,994
- She's right, man. It's beautiful.
- But what the hell is the big deal?

1225
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:05,664
We're supposed to experience everything.

1226
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:08,692
Honey, would you get that?

1227
01:35:11,572 --> 01:35:15,030
First we'll have an orgy,
and then we'll go see Tony Bennett.

1228
01:36:37,324 --> 01:36:38,791
Come on.

1229
01:38:25,766 --> 01:38:26,824
No.

1230
01:38:42,783 --> 01:38:45,274
Did you put any money into Pittston, Bob?

1231
01:38:47,421 --> 01:38:48,445
No.

1232
01:38:50,824 --> 01:38:52,815
I'm sick with myself, too.

1233
01:38:53,127 --> 01:38:57,120
You know, I gave everybody I knew
Worthington Oil...

1234
01:38:57,798 --> 01:39:00,562
and it was only at three,
and I didn't take any myself.

1235
01:39:00,668 --> 01:39:03,000
What is it at now?

1236
01:39:04,538 --> 01:39:05,766
Fifteen.
