1
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:43,375
Good night, Pat.

2
00:04:43,444 --> 00:04:44,638
Good night.

3
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:50,383
What happened to the old bank?
It was beautiful.

4
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:51,884
People kept robbing it.

5
00:04:51,953 --> 00:04:54,786
That's a small price to pay
for beauty.

6
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:02,053
Hit me.

7
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:07,629
Again.

8
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:11,937
Bust!

9
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:15,441
Give me credit,
Mr. Macon?

10
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,536
You know my rules, Tom.

11
00:05:20,415 --> 00:05:23,350
Well, it looks like
you just about

12
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:24,851
cleaned everybody out,
fella.

13
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,854
You haven't lost a hand
since you got the deal.

14
00:05:27,922 --> 00:05:30,356
What's the secret
of your success?

15
00:05:33,428 --> 00:05:34,360
Prayer.

16
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,854
Let's just
you and me play.

17
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:56,007
Hit it.

18
00:06:00,888 --> 00:06:01,946
Bust.

19
00:06:05,126 --> 00:06:08,562
Yeah, you're a hell of
a card player, fella.

20
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:12,565
I know, 'cause I'm
a hell of a card player,

21
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:16,034
and I can't even spot
how you're cheating.

22
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,082
The money stays,
and you go.

23
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:36,355
Well, we seem to be

24
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:38,358
a little short
on brotherly love

25
00:06:38,426 --> 00:06:39,552
around here.

26
00:06:39,627 --> 00:06:42,357
If you're with him,
you better get out of here.

27
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,863
We're on our way.

28
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,363
I wasn't cheating.

29
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:46,364
Come on.

30
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:47,866
I wasn't cheating!

31
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:50,368
You can die.
You can both die.

32
00:06:50,437 --> 00:06:51,870
You hear that?

33
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:54,873
If he invites us
to stay, then we'll go.

34
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:57,375
He's got to invite us
to stick around.

35
00:06:58,445 --> 00:06:59,878
He'll draw on you.

36
00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:02,506
You don't know
how fast he is.

37
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,325
I'm over the hill,
but it can happen to you.

38
00:07:13,393 --> 00:07:15,827
That's just
what I want to hear.

39
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:18,330
Every day you get older.
That's a law.

40
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:29,341
What would you think about

41
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:31,843
maybe asking us
to stick around?

42
00:07:31,912 --> 00:07:32,879
What?

43
00:07:32,946 --> 00:07:35,346
You don't have to mean it
or anything.

44
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:37,849
Just ask us to stick around.
I promise...

45
00:07:45,425 --> 00:07:47,359
I can't help you,
Sundance.

46
00:07:58,638 --> 00:08:01,072
I didn't know you were
the Sundance Kid

47
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:03,006
when I said
you were cheating.

48
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:08,680
I draw on you,
you'll kill me.

49
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:11,216
There's that
possibility.

50
00:08:12,385 --> 00:08:13,818
You'd be killing yourself.

51
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:17,288
Why don't you just invite us
to stick around?

52
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:20,892
You can do it...

53
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:22,394
and easy.

54
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:24,623
Come on.

55
00:08:27,532 --> 00:08:29,432
Come on.

56
00:08:30,402 --> 00:08:32,461
Why don't you
stick around?

57
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:35,631
Thanks, but we
got to get going.

58
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,438
Hey, Kid.

59
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:46,279
Hey, Kid,
how good are you?

60
00:08:57,929 --> 00:08:59,863
Like I been
telling you...

61
00:08:59,931 --> 00:09:01,193
over the hill.

62
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:58,183
Boy, you know,

63
00:09:58,256 --> 00:10:00,349
every time I see
Hole-In-The-Wall,

64
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:02,859
it's like seeing it
for the first time.

65
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:05,862
Every time, I ask myself
the same question...

66
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,094
how can I be so damn stupid
to keep coming back?

67
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:18,375
What's your idea
this time?

68
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:19,569
Bolivia.

69
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,112
What's Bolivia?

70
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:25,877
Bolivia... that's
a country, stupid.

71
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,383
Central or
South America.

72
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:29,477
One or the other.

73
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:31,488
Let's go to Mexico
instead.

74
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:33,990
All they got in Mexico
is sweat.

75
00:10:34,058 --> 00:10:35,992
There's too much
of that here.

76
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,996
If we'd been in business
during the California gold rush,

77
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:42,498
where would we have gone?
California, right?

78
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:45,195
When I say Bolivia,
you just think California.

79
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,703
You wouldn't believe
what they're finding

80
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:49,705
in the ground down there.

81
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:51,206
They're just
falling into it.

82
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,709
Silver mines,
gold mines, tin mines.

83
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:57,713
Payrolls so heavy we'd strain
ourselves stealing them.

84
00:11:00,317 --> 00:11:02,182
You just keep thinking,
Butch.

85
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:04,186
That's what you're good at.

86
00:11:04,254 --> 00:11:05,687
Boy, I got vision,

87
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:08,691
and the rest of the world
wears bifocals.

88
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:32,278
Hi, News.
What you doing?

89
00:11:32,349 --> 00:11:36,843
Aw, howdy, Butch.
Uh, nothing.

90
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,353
Nothing.

91
00:11:38,422 --> 00:11:39,753
Howdy, Sundance.

92
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:41,757
You sure are. You're
doing something. What?

93
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:47,763
<i>Just fixing to rob
the Union Pacific Flyer, Butch,</i>

94
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:50,959
like what we had in mind.

95
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:55,437
You fellas got everything
I told you all wrong.

96
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:57,598
<i>Sure, we might
hit the Flyer,</i>

97
00:11:57,674 --> 00:12:00,609
but even if we do,
it won't be this run.

98
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:03,043
It'll be the next one,
the return.

99
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:05,547
Sundance and me,
we been checking the banks.

100
00:12:05,616 --> 00:12:06,640
No banks.

101
00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:07,706
What?

102
00:12:08,785 --> 00:12:10,275
<i>The Flyer, Butch.</i>

103
00:12:12,322 --> 00:12:15,257
Fellas, bad as they are,
banks are better than trains.

104
00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:17,259
They don't move.
They stay put.

105
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:19,261
You know
the money's in there.

106
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:20,990
When I left,
I gave orders.

107
00:12:21,064 --> 00:12:22,998
New orders
been given.

108
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:25,000
I run things here,
Harvey.

109
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:27,002
Used to you did.

110
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,662
Me now.

111
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:32,072
This don't concern you.

112
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:36,771
You tell him
to stay out.

113
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:39,509
Well, he goes his own way,
like always.

114
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,517
What's the matter
with you guys?

115
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:43,018
When I came here,

116
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:45,020
you were nothing.
I formed you.

117
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:46,020
Who says?

118
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:48,023
Read them
a clipping, News.

119
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:49,023
Which one?

120
00:12:49,092 --> 00:12:50,320
Any of them.

121
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:58,834
<i>This one here's
from Salt Lake Herald.</i>

122
00:12:58,902 --> 00:13:01,132
"Butch Cassidy's
Hole-In-The-Wall Gang..."

123
00:13:01,204 --> 00:13:02,193
That's me!

124
00:13:02,272 --> 00:13:04,706
You want Harvey
to do your planning?

125
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:07,710
Want him to do your
thinking for you?

126
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:09,712
You want him
to run things?

127
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,611
Shut up now, News.

128
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:14,116
Not till I get
to the good part.

129
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:16,618
"Also known to have
participated in the holdup

130
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:19,121
are Flat Nose Curry
and News Carver."

131
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:22,454
I just love to read my name
in the paper, Butch.

132
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:25,461
So we just forget
about Logan taking over,

133
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:26,655
OK, Flat Nose?

134
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,163
You always said

135
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:30,358
that any one of us
could challenge you.

136
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,868
'Cause I figured
no one would do it.

137
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:34,301
Figured wrong, Butch.

138
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:36,532
You guys
can't want Logan!

139
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:40,175
At least
he's with us.

140
00:13:40,243 --> 00:13:42,677
You been spending
a lot of time gone.

141
00:13:42,746 --> 00:13:44,680
Well, that's because
everything's different now.

142
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:46,181
Guns or knives, Butch?

143
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:48,683
You got to plan more,
prepare more.

144
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:50,083
Guns or knives?

145
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:51,051
Neither.

146
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,110
Pick!

147
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:55,386
I don't want to shoot
with you, Harvey.

148
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,791
Anything you say, Butch.

149
00:14:13,677 --> 00:14:18,341
Maybe there's a way
to make a profit in this.

150
00:14:18,415 --> 00:14:19,939
Bet on Logan.

151
00:14:20,016 --> 00:14:22,951
I would,
but who'd bet on you?

152
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,179
Sundance...

153
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:28,357
when we're done
and he's dead,

154
00:14:28,425 --> 00:14:30,689
you're welcome to stay.

155
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:33,195
I don't mean to be
a sore loser,

156
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:36,096
but when it's done,
if I'm dead, kill him.

157
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,565
Love to.

158
00:14:46,943 --> 00:14:48,376
No, no. Not yet.

159
00:14:48,445 --> 00:14:50,207
Not until me and Harvey

160
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,974
get the rules
straightened out.

161
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:54,379
Rules in a knife fight?

162
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,281
No rules.

163
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:58,820
If there ain't any rules,
let's get started.

164
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:00,753
Someone count
1, 2, 3, go.

165
00:15:00,823 --> 00:15:01,721
1, 2, 3, go.

166
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:08,796
I was really rooting
for you, Butch.

167
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:10,593
Well, thank you,
Flat Nose.

168
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,999
That's what sustained me
in my time of trouble.

169
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:17,838
<i>Hey, what's this
about the Flyer?</i>

170
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:19,340
Harvey said we'd hit it

171
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:21,342
both this run
and the return.

172
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,844
<i>Nobody's done that
to the Flyer before.</i>

173
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:26,347
No matter how much
we got at first,

174
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:28,610
they'd figure
the return was safe

175
00:15:28,684 --> 00:15:30,345
and load it up
with money.

176
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:31,852
Harvey thought of that?

177
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:33,354
Yes, sir, he did.

178
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:35,356
I'll tell you something,
fellas.

179
00:15:35,424 --> 00:15:37,915
That's exactly what
we're going to do.

180
00:16:14,863 --> 00:16:15,887
Stop it.

181
00:16:15,964 --> 00:16:17,795
Where?

182
00:16:17,866 --> 00:16:20,300
Up ahead there.

183
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:22,462
Bet that's old Butch
himself.

184
00:16:29,878 --> 00:16:31,345
Hold it there.

185
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:34,348
Just thought I'd watch.

186
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,850
Bring the kids,
why don't you?

187
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:38,352
Stick your heads in.

188
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,878
You're just going to
get yourself blown up

189
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:43,891
you don't open
that door.

190
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:46,894
I can't do that.
I work for Mr. E.H. Harriman

191
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:48,896
of the Union Pacific
Railroad. He...

192
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:50,898
Shut up about
that E.H. Harriman stuff

193
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:51,898
and open up.

194
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,400
What's going on?

195
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:55,403
We got a patriot
in there.

196
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:57,405
That's young Woodcock.
He's awful dedicated.

197
00:16:57,473 --> 00:16:58,405
Woodcock?

198
00:16:58,474 --> 00:16:59,406
Yes, sir.

199
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:01,602
You know who we are?

200
00:17:01,677 --> 00:17:04,612
You're the Hole-In-The-Wall
Gang, Mr. Cassidy.

201
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,113
I understand that,

202
00:17:06,181 --> 00:17:10,174
but Mr. E.H. Harriman
himself give me this job.

203
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:12,186
I got to do my best.

204
00:17:12,254 --> 00:17:14,688
Your best don't include
getting yourself killed.

205
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:15,815
Dynamite's ready.

206
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:18,189
Mr. E.H. Harriman himself
had the confidence...

207
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,524
Open the door,
or that's it.

208
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:22,029
You think
E.H. Harriman

209
00:17:22,097 --> 00:17:24,327
would get himself
killed for you,

210
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:25,525
Woodcock?

211
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:28,035
I work
for Mr. E.H. Harriman

212
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:30,037
of the Union Pacific
Railroad,

213
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:31,663
and he entrusted me...

214
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:48,354
Hey, Woodcock.

215
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:50,357
Woodcock,
you all right?

216
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:51,858
Hey.

217
00:17:51,927 --> 00:17:53,588
Hmm?

218
00:17:58,433 --> 00:18:01,197
Whatever Harriman's
paying you ain't enough.

219
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:13,314
There ain't what I'd call
a fortune in there, Butch.

220
00:18:13,382 --> 00:18:15,816
Well, just so
we come out ahead.

221
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:17,545
That's the main thing.

222
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:18,800
The Hole-In-The-Wall Gang

223
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:19,981
The Hole-In-The-Wall Gang

224
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:24,014
<i>just robbed the Flyer
right outside of our town,</i>

225
00:18:24,092 --> 00:18:26,526
so that makes it
our responsibility

226
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:29,120
to get out there
and get after them.

227
00:18:29,198 --> 00:18:31,632
You'll have to bring
your own horses.

228
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,863
How many of you
can bring your own guns?

229
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:42,172
How many of you will want me
to supply you with guns?

230
00:18:46,415 --> 00:18:47,541
Well... come on now.

231
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:50,847
I think it's up to us
to do something, don't you?

232
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:52,511
What's the point?

233
00:18:52,587 --> 00:18:53,849
They're probably
halfway

234
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:55,513
to Hole-In-The-Wall
already.

235
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,024
That's exactly
why we have got to hurry.

236
00:18:58,092 --> 00:19:00,026
If we mount up
right now

237
00:19:00,094 --> 00:19:01,959
and get out there
after them,

238
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:03,963
maybe we can head them off.

239
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:06,465
If we did that,
they'd kill us.

240
00:19:06,534 --> 00:19:10,470
We don't want to let them
get away with this.

241
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:14,973
Boy, I just eat this up
with a spoon.

242
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:17,977
All right, youse two,
I want you at my party.

243
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:18,977
What party?

244
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:20,980
I'm losing
my piano player.

245
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:23,482
He's going off
to fight the war.

246
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:25,212
What war?

247
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:27,117
The war
with the Spanish.

248
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:29,315
<i>Remember
the Maine.</i>

249
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,823
Who can forget it?

250
00:19:30,892 --> 00:19:33,656
I'm giving him a send-off.
so come on.

251
00:19:45,506 --> 00:19:47,440
When I was a kid,

252
00:19:47,508 --> 00:19:50,341
I always thought
I would grow up

253
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:51,742
to be a hero.

254
00:19:51,812 --> 00:19:53,245
It's too late now.

255
00:19:53,314 --> 00:19:55,942
Why'd you say something
like that?

256
00:19:56,017 --> 00:19:58,383
You didn't have to say
something like that.

257
00:19:58,452 --> 00:20:00,386
You want me
to go alone

258
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:02,888
and fight
the Hole-In-The-Wall Gang?

259
00:20:02,957 --> 00:20:04,390
That's fine with me.

260
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,393
If you want your kids
to know you let me,

261
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:09,190
<i>that's fine with me,</i>

262
00:20:09,263 --> 00:20:12,824
but I don't think
that's what you want.

263
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,162
Is it?

264
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:21,240
Why don't we enlist,
go fight the Spanish?

265
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:23,243
You and me in the war.

266
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:26,246
We got a lot of things
going for us...

267
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:27,747
experience, maturity,
leadership.

268
00:20:27,815 --> 00:20:30,249
I'll bet
we end up officers.

269
00:20:30,318 --> 00:20:32,513
I'd be Major Parker.

270
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:36,182
Parker?

271
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:38,282
Yeah.
That's my real name.

272
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:41,594
Robert Leroy Parker.

273
00:20:41,662 --> 00:20:43,095
No fooling?

274
00:20:43,164 --> 00:20:44,392
No.

275
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,130
Mine's Longbaugh.

276
00:20:50,204 --> 00:20:51,796
No fooling.

277
00:20:51,872 --> 00:20:53,362
Long what?

278
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:55,409
Harry Longbaugh.

279
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:57,410
So you'd be
Major Longbaugh.

280
00:20:57,478 --> 00:20:58,911
What do you say?

281
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:05,351
You just keep thinking,
Butch.

282
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:07,353
That's what you're good at.

283
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:08,854
<i>But you're not frightened.</i>

284
00:21:08,923 --> 00:21:09,855
<i>No, sir.</i>

285
00:21:09,924 --> 00:21:11,858
<i>You have got respect for me,</i>

286
00:21:11,926 --> 00:21:14,326
<i>and I have got
respect for you.</i>

287
00:21:14,395 --> 00:21:17,364
That's why you
and you and you

288
00:21:17,431 --> 00:21:19,422
are riding with me.
Am I right?

289
00:21:21,402 --> 00:21:23,962
Well, what do you say?

290
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:26,063
I say this.

291
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,042
I say, ladies
and gentlemen,

292
00:21:30,111 --> 00:21:32,375
boys and girls,
friends and enemies,

293
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:33,879
meet the future!

294
00:21:33,948 --> 00:21:35,381
The future what?

295
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:37,383
The future mode
of transportation

296
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:39,646
for this weary
Western world.

297
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,156
Now, I'm not going to make
a lot of extravagant claims.

298
00:21:43,224 --> 00:21:46,159
Sure, it'll change your
whole life for the better,

299
00:21:46,227 --> 00:21:47,660
but that's all.

300
00:21:47,728 --> 00:21:50,162
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

301
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:51,664
You got the crowd together,

302
00:21:51,732 --> 00:21:54,166
so I thought I'd do
a little selling.

303
00:21:54,235 --> 00:21:56,669
I'm trying to raise
a posse here.

304
00:21:56,737 --> 00:21:58,170
A short presentation.

305
00:21:58,239 --> 00:21:59,672
The horse is dead.

306
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,503
This item sells itself.

307
00:22:01,575 --> 00:22:05,011
<i>Are you going to listen
to him or come with me?</i>

308
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:08,014
Butch, Fanny says to
come into her party

309
00:22:08,082 --> 00:22:09,049
right now.

310
00:22:09,116 --> 00:22:12,552
<i>No oats, no mess,
no kicks, no bites,</i>

311
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,054
<i>no running away,
no stepping on your foot.</i>

312
00:22:15,122 --> 00:22:18,057
Well, I think
I'll get saddled up

313
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,889
and go looking
for a woman.

314
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:22,986
Good hunting.

315
00:22:24,932 --> 00:22:28,231
Shouldn't take more
than a couple of days.

316
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,907
I'm not picky...

317
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:37,377
as long as she's smart,

318
00:22:37,445 --> 00:22:39,072
pretty...

319
00:22:39,146 --> 00:22:40,636
sweet...

320
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,213
gentle, and...

321
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:47,550
tender and refined...

322
00:22:49,156 --> 00:22:50,384
lovely...

323
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,016
carefree.

324
00:23:56,289 --> 00:23:57,347
Aah!

325
00:24:00,326 --> 00:24:02,487
Keep going,
teacher lady.

326
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:12,799
It's OK Don't mind me.
Keep on going.

327
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:42,358
Let down your hair.

328
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,041
Shake your head.

329
00:26:05,485 --> 00:26:07,680
Do you know
what I wish?

330
00:26:07,754 --> 00:26:10,689
That once you'd get here
on time.

331
00:26:13,593 --> 00:26:16,585
You are mine,
Etta Place.

332
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:18,596
Mine.

333
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:20,097
You hear me?

334
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:21,656
Mine.

335
00:26:21,734 --> 00:26:23,725
All mine.

336
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:30,366
Your soft white flesh
is mine.

337
00:26:30,443 --> 00:26:31,740
Soft...

338
00:26:31,811 --> 00:26:33,403
white...

339
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:35,709
bwhaa!

340
00:26:42,622 --> 00:26:44,055
Meet the future.

341
00:26:45,258 --> 00:26:47,692
Do you know
what you're doing?

342
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,692
Theoretically.

343
00:26:48,761 --> 00:26:49,989
Aah!

344
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:10,393
<i>You've come to get him
for the Flyer?</i>

345
00:30:10,462 --> 00:30:12,396
Would you believe
I'm broke already?

346
00:30:12,464 --> 00:30:14,898
Why is there never
any money, Butch?

347
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:16,900
I swear, Etta,
I don't know.

348
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:19,903
I've been working
like a dog all my life,

349
00:30:19,971 --> 00:30:22,906
and I can't get
a penny ahead.

350
00:30:22,974 --> 00:30:25,408
Sundance says it's because
you're a soft touch

351
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:27,411
and always taking
expensive vacations,

352
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:28,912
buying drinks
for everyone,

353
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,914
and you're
a rotten gambler.

354
00:30:30,982 --> 00:30:33,416
That might have
something to do with it.

355
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,531
Butch.

356
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,567
Hmm?

357
00:30:49,634 --> 00:30:52,034
Do you ever wonder
if I'd met you first

358
00:30:52,103 --> 00:30:54,503
we'd been the ones
to get involved?

359
00:30:54,572 --> 00:30:57,541
We are involved, Etta.
Don't you know that?

360
00:30:59,611 --> 00:31:01,544
You are riding
on my bicycle.

361
00:31:01,612 --> 00:31:02,977
In some Arabian countries,

362
00:31:03,047 --> 00:31:04,981
that's the same
as being married.

363
00:31:09,887 --> 00:31:11,616
Hey.

364
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:13,986
What are you doing?

365
00:31:14,058 --> 00:31:15,491
Stealing your woman.

366
00:31:18,896 --> 00:31:19,828
Take her.

367
00:31:19,897 --> 00:31:21,296
Take her.

368
00:31:22,566 --> 00:31:24,500
Well, you're
a romantic bastard.

369
00:31:24,568 --> 00:31:26,269
I'll give you that.

370
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:37,679
OK, open up
in there.

371
00:31:37,747 --> 00:31:40,181
I work for
Mr. E.H. Harriman...

372
00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:41,682
Hey, Woodcock!

373
00:31:41,751 --> 00:31:43,184
Butch?

374
00:31:43,252 --> 00:31:44,310
You OK?

375
00:31:44,387 --> 00:31:45,820
Uh, well, sort of.

376
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:48,823
Hey, that's wonderful.
Let's take a look at you.

377
00:31:50,092 --> 00:31:51,525
Well, now, Butch,

378
00:31:51,594 --> 00:31:54,028
you've got to have
more respect for me

379
00:31:54,096 --> 00:31:57,031
than to think I'd fall
for a stunt like that.

380
00:32:00,102 --> 00:32:02,662
You can't want to
get blown up again?

381
00:32:02,738 --> 00:32:05,673
Uh, Butch, you know
if it were my money,

382
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:08,175
there's nobody I'd
rather have steal it

383
00:32:08,244 --> 00:32:09,176
than you.

384
00:32:09,245 --> 00:32:11,179
But I'm still
in the employ

385
00:32:11,247 --> 00:32:12,680
of Mr. E.H. Harriman

386
00:32:12,748 --> 00:32:14,682
of the Union Pacific
Railroad.

387
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,149
Start this train!

388
00:32:16,218 --> 00:32:17,651
Get back inside,
lady.

389
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,153
I'm not afraid of you.

390
00:32:19,221 --> 00:32:20,654
I'm not afraid
of anything.

391
00:32:20,723 --> 00:32:22,657
I'm a grandmother
and a female,

392
00:32:22,725 --> 00:32:24,158
and I've
got my rights.

393
00:32:24,226 --> 00:32:26,160
We got no time
for this.

394
00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:28,662
You can bull the others,
but not me.

395
00:32:28,731 --> 00:32:31,165
I've fought whiskey,
and I've fought gambling...

396
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:33,565
We got no time
for this.

397
00:32:33,636 --> 00:32:36,070
What are you doing?
Let go!

398
00:32:36,138 --> 00:32:38,572
What are you
going to do to her?

399
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:40,074
Well,
leave her alone.

400
00:32:40,142 --> 00:32:41,575
You're after
the money,

401
00:32:41,644 --> 00:32:43,077
and the money's
in here.

402
00:32:43,145 --> 00:32:44,578
Please! All I want

403
00:32:44,647 --> 00:32:46,581
is for somebody to
start this train.

404
00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:47,581
Somebody, please!

405
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,083
Open the door,
Woodcock,

406
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:50,584
or tell her
goodbye.

407
00:32:50,653 --> 00:32:53,087
Our Father,
who art in heaven,

408
00:32:53,155 --> 00:32:55,089
hallowed be Thy name,

409
00:32:55,157 --> 00:32:57,091
Thy kingdom come,

410
00:32:57,159 --> 00:32:59,093
Thy will be done,

411
00:32:59,161 --> 00:33:02,028
on earth
as it is in heaven.

412
00:33:02,098 --> 00:33:05,033
What am I going to tell
poor Mr. Harriman?

413
00:33:07,203 --> 00:33:10,138
Woodcock, what'd
you have to go and do

414
00:33:10,206 --> 00:33:11,639
something like that for?

415
00:33:11,707 --> 00:33:14,471
Well, Butch, you blew
the last one so easy,

416
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,636
I just had to,
um, do something.

417
00:33:16,712 --> 00:33:19,647
Give me that
and get some more,

418
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:21,080
a lot more!

419
00:33:22,885 --> 00:33:24,910
Well, that
ought to do it.

420
00:33:45,574 --> 00:33:48,008
Think you used enough
dynamite there, Butch?

421
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,241
Ha ha ha ha.

422
00:34:43,132 --> 00:34:45,225
What the hell is that?

423
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,555
Whatever they're selling,
I don't want it.

424
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,765
Will you leave it?

425
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,475
Come on!

426
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,636
Hyah!

427
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:49,862
Hey, Butch!

428
00:35:49,931 --> 00:35:50,989
What?

429
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,464
They're very good!

430
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,495
Split up!

431
00:36:09,017 --> 00:36:11,451
How many of 'em
are following us?

432
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:12,952
All of 'em.

433
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:14,283
All of 'em?

434
00:36:14,355 --> 00:36:17,119
What's the matter
with those guys?

435
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:18,818
Hyah!

436
00:37:46,481 --> 00:37:49,973
I think we lost 'em.
Do you think we lost 'em?

437
00:37:50,051 --> 00:37:51,882
No.

438
00:37:51,953 --> 00:37:54,046
Neither do I. Hyah!

439
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:12,970
Take our horses out
back. Feed 'em good.

440
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,972
Where's Sweetface?

441
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,474
Just inside.
Trouble?

442
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,475
Listen,
you dirty old man,

443
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,478
I know you're
a lying thief

444
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,979
and so do you,

445
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,481
but who'd know it
to look at you?

446
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,983
Get yourself
out front fast.

447
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,484
You seen us
ride through

448
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,986
not five minutes
ago.

449
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,487
Do this right,

450
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,490
I'll get you
an old dog to kick.

451
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,992
Here, room 9.
Top of the stairs.

452
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,175
Hey, you realize
you're driving me crazy

453
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,177
staring out
the window like that?

454
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,475
I swear, Sweetface
can handle it, easy.

455
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,482
He wouldn't dare
louse me up.

456
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,984
He's that scared of me.

457
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,923
Hey, kid, how can I
give Agnes

458
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:07,425
the concentration
she deserves

459
00:39:07,494 --> 00:39:10,429
with you staring out
the window like that?

460
00:39:10,497 --> 00:39:11,930
Butch, you're
really something,

461
00:39:11,998 --> 00:39:13,556
you know that?

462
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:16,101
Could you be
a little more specific

463
00:39:16,169 --> 00:39:17,431
about that, Agnes?

464
00:39:18,505 --> 00:39:19,437
Butch!

465
00:39:26,012 --> 00:39:28,947
OK, Sweetface,
give them a nice smile.

466
00:39:29,015 --> 00:39:30,448
Come on.

467
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:33,952
That's a nice touch.

468
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,954
<i>I swear, if he told me</i>

469
00:39:36,022 --> 00:39:38,456
I rode out of town
10 minutes ago,

470
00:39:38,525 --> 00:39:39,787
I'd believe him.

471
00:39:41,528 --> 00:39:43,359
And there they go.

472
00:39:52,038 --> 00:39:53,471
No, no.

473
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,474
Don't ask me
to stay.

474
00:40:03,516 --> 00:40:05,984
You're the only
real man I ever met.

475
00:40:06,052 --> 00:40:07,986
You know that, Butch?

476
00:40:08,054 --> 00:40:10,488
It's not just 'cause
of all that money

477
00:40:10,557 --> 00:40:13,492
you got to spend
on people. It's you.

478
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,993
The way you're always

479
00:40:15,061 --> 00:40:17,495
looking to see
am I happy or not?

480
00:40:17,564 --> 00:40:19,498
A lot of
the other girls,

481
00:40:19,566 --> 00:40:21,500
they... they
might want you

482
00:40:21,568 --> 00:40:24,002
for when you
got lots of money

483
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,002
to spend on people.

484
00:40:25,071 --> 00:40:28,006
Me, I... I
don't care about...

485
00:40:28,074 --> 00:40:31,510
clothes and
money and jewels...

486
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:35,013
and furs,

487
00:40:35,081 --> 00:40:37,015
and
things like that.

488
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:39,517
Lots of the other
girls do,

489
00:40:39,586 --> 00:40:41,520
but I never did.

490
00:40:41,588 --> 00:40:43,556
I always said,
"Agnes..."

491
00:41:01,608 --> 00:41:04,236
Don't move.

492
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,470
Stand up.

493
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:07,479
Put your hands up.

494
00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:08,639
Higher.

495
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,484
Now turn around
and start...

496
00:41:17,557 --> 00:41:20,617
Get our horses and
come on back here.

497
00:41:28,568 --> 00:41:29,500
Hyah!

498
00:41:29,569 --> 00:41:31,833
Get out of here!

499
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:32,929
Get out!

500
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,509
Go on!

501
00:41:37,577 --> 00:41:40,011
Get out of here,
you fat-headed beast!

502
00:41:41,581 --> 00:41:42,605
Come on!

503
00:41:42,682 --> 00:41:45,583
You're the fat-headed beast.
Quit shouting!

504
00:41:45,652 --> 00:41:47,950
Boy, somebody
sure trained 'em.

505
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,576
Which way?

506
00:42:18,651 --> 00:42:20,710
Well,
it doesn't matter.

507
00:42:20,787 --> 00:42:22,721
I don't know where
we've been,

508
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:24,222
and I've just
been there.

509
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,053
They can't follow us.
We're safe.

510
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,320
You really think so?

511
00:42:27,393 --> 00:42:29,293
I will if you will.

512
00:42:58,591 --> 00:43:01,958
How long you figure
we've been watching?

513
00:43:02,028 --> 00:43:03,859
Oh, a while.

514
00:43:16,508 --> 00:43:20,444
How long before you figure
they're not after us?

515
00:43:20,512 --> 00:43:21,979
A while longer.

516
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,711
How come you're
so talkative?

517
00:43:28,387 --> 00:43:30,719
Just naturally
blabby, I guess.

518
00:43:33,992 --> 00:43:36,426
Ohh! I haven't done
so much riding

519
00:43:36,495 --> 00:43:37,928
since I quit rustling.

520
00:43:37,996 --> 00:43:39,930
That's a miserable
occupation.

521
00:43:39,998 --> 00:43:42,990
Dusk to dawn,
no sleep, rotten food.

522
00:43:47,573 --> 00:43:49,507
Hey.

523
00:43:49,575 --> 00:43:51,042
I see it.

524
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:57,515
Torches you think?

525
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:59,016
Yeah, maybe.

526
00:43:59,084 --> 00:44:00,517
Maybe lanterns.

527
00:44:01,587 --> 00:44:03,452
They're
following our path.

528
00:44:05,023 --> 00:44:07,423
Dead on it.

529
00:44:07,492 --> 00:44:09,926
I couldn't do that.
Could you do that?

530
00:44:09,995 --> 00:44:11,929
How can they do that?

531
00:44:13,165 --> 00:44:14,962
Who are those guys?

532
00:44:27,346 --> 00:44:29,280
You sure
this'll work?

533
00:44:29,348 --> 00:44:30,280
It'll work.

534
00:44:30,349 --> 00:44:32,283
That's what you said
about Sweetface.

535
00:44:32,351 --> 00:44:33,784
This'll work.

536
00:44:57,576 --> 00:44:59,510
Once they divide up,

537
00:44:59,578 --> 00:45:02,445
we take them,
no trouble, right?

538
00:45:02,514 --> 00:45:03,913
Maybe.

539
00:45:03,982 --> 00:45:05,415
Boy, for a gunman,

540
00:45:05,484 --> 00:45:07,452
you're one hell
of a pessimist.

541
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,953
They ought to get

542
00:45:10,022 --> 00:45:14,789
to where we split up
any time.

543
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,760
They're
just about there.

544
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,564
How many of them do you
think will come our way?

545
00:45:23,634 --> 00:45:25,568
Oh, I wish
we had rifles.

546
00:45:25,636 --> 00:45:27,467
I mean,
they got rifles.

547
00:45:27,538 --> 00:45:29,972
But we got surprise
on our side, right?

548
00:45:35,546 --> 00:45:38,208
So far, they're
doing what we want.

549
00:45:42,553 --> 00:45:45,488
You think we ought to
take them from up here?

550
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:53,496
Kid, look, you know this
work better than I do.

551
00:45:53,564 --> 00:45:54,997
Is it best here,

552
00:45:55,066 --> 00:45:57,330
or maybe down there,
closer to the trail?

553
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,260
Uh...

554
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:04,499
Damn it!

555
00:46:07,512 --> 00:46:10,447
They're not
going for it.

556
00:46:12,517 --> 00:46:14,712
Who are those guys?

557
00:46:14,785 --> 00:46:17,720
I don't know.

558
00:46:17,788 --> 00:46:18,948
I don't know.

559
00:46:19,023 --> 00:46:21,457
We got to do something
and shake them.

560
00:46:21,526 --> 00:46:23,460
Whatever
you come up with

561
00:46:23,528 --> 00:46:24,961
is fine with me,

562
00:46:25,029 --> 00:46:27,463
but whatever it is,
it better be now!

563
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:40,944
What are you
doing here?

564
00:46:41,012 --> 00:46:42,445
Easy, Ray. Easy.

565
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:45,448
What the hell do you mean,
take it easy?

566
00:46:45,516 --> 00:46:47,848
You promised you'd never
come into my territory.

567
00:46:47,919 --> 00:46:48,851
And we haven't.

568
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,353
Just because
we were friendly

569
00:46:50,421 --> 00:46:52,855
doesn't give you
the right to break in.

570
00:46:52,924 --> 00:46:54,551
What if we was
seen together?

571
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:57,560
I'm too old
to find another job.

572
00:46:57,628 --> 00:47:00,495
At least have the decency
to draw your guns.

573
00:47:00,565 --> 00:47:02,999
Listen, Butch is trying
to tell you something.

574
00:47:03,067 --> 00:47:05,501
All right.
What do you want?

575
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:07,003
A couple of things.

576
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:09,005
We want to enlist, Ray.

577
00:47:09,073 --> 00:47:10,938
In the army.
Right away.

578
00:47:11,008 --> 00:47:12,669
Go fight the Spanish.

579
00:47:17,781 --> 00:47:20,215
Oh, you're crazy.
You are crazy.

580
00:47:20,283 --> 00:47:22,717
You are,
both of you, crazy!

581
00:47:22,786 --> 00:47:27,223
They'd throw you in jail
for a thousand years each.

582
00:47:32,495 --> 00:47:35,726
Come on, Sundance.
Start trussing my feet.

583
00:47:38,101 --> 00:47:40,535
Here. You seen these
before. Come on!

584
00:47:40,604 --> 00:47:42,538
I'm not taking
the chance

585
00:47:42,606 --> 00:47:44,471
that someone
saw you coming in.

586
00:47:44,541 --> 00:47:45,974
We're serious about this.

587
00:47:46,042 --> 00:47:47,475
You are known outlaws.

588
00:47:47,544 --> 00:47:48,476
We'd quit.

589
00:47:48,545 --> 00:47:50,979
That's the point.
Is that on tight?

590
00:47:51,047 --> 00:47:51,979
That's all right.

591
00:47:52,048 --> 00:47:53,982
There's some hankies
in the drawer

592
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:55,984
you can use
to gag me.

593
00:47:56,052 --> 00:47:57,679
I swear,
this'd work, Ray.

594
00:47:57,754 --> 00:48:00,188
You trust us.
The government trusts you.

595
00:48:00,257 --> 00:48:02,418
Anything you tell them
they gotta believe, right?

596
00:48:02,492 --> 00:48:05,427
You've never done
a dishonest thing ever,

597
00:48:05,495 --> 00:48:07,429
and you're pushing 60.
We'd quit.

598
00:48:07,497 --> 00:48:09,431
They'd drop the charges
against us,

599
00:48:09,499 --> 00:48:11,433
we'd fight till
the war is over.

600
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:13,901
They don't even have
to make us officers.

601
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:15,232
That's some proposition.

602
00:48:15,305 --> 00:48:17,102
They forget
all about the years

603
00:48:17,173 --> 00:48:18,435
of thieving and robbing.

604
00:48:18,508 --> 00:48:20,271
They take you
into the army,

605
00:48:20,343 --> 00:48:24,541
which is what you want
in the first place.

606
00:48:24,614 --> 00:48:26,047
There's something
out there

607
00:48:26,116 --> 00:48:28,277
that scares you, huh?

608
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:31,453
But it's too late.

609
00:48:31,521 --> 00:48:33,455
You should've let
yourself get killed

610
00:48:33,523 --> 00:48:35,423
while you had
the chance.

611
00:48:35,492 --> 00:48:38,928
You may be the biggest
thing to hit this area,

612
00:48:38,995 --> 00:48:41,429
but you're still
two-bit outlaws.

613
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:44,934
I never met a soul more
affable than you, Butch,

614
00:48:45,001 --> 00:48:46,434
or faster than the Kid.

615
00:48:46,503 --> 00:48:48,437
But you're still
two-bit outlaws

616
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:49,437
on the dodge.

617
00:48:49,506 --> 00:48:51,736
It's over!
Don't you get that?

618
00:48:51,808 --> 00:48:53,241
Your times is over,

619
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:55,244
and you're gonna
die bloody,

620
00:48:55,312 --> 00:48:58,406
and all you can do
is choose where.

621
00:48:58,481 --> 00:48:59,413
I'm sorry,

622
00:48:59,482 --> 00:49:02,246
I'm getting mean
in my old age.

623
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,753
Come on. Shut me up,
Sundance.

624
00:51:24,827 --> 00:51:27,125
Ah, you're wasting
your time.

625
00:51:27,196 --> 00:51:29,630
They can't track us
over rock.

626
00:51:29,698 --> 00:51:31,131
Tell them that.

627
00:51:57,259 --> 00:51:59,693
They're beginning
to get on my nerves.

628
00:52:01,263 --> 00:52:03,356
Who are those guys?

629
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,833
You remember the time

630
00:52:06,902 --> 00:52:09,336
you, me, and Etta
went to Denver

631
00:52:09,404 --> 00:52:10,336
for a vacation?

632
00:52:10,405 --> 00:52:12,839
I'm glad you
brought that up, Kid.

633
00:52:12,908 --> 00:52:15,342
That's an important topic,
considering our situation.

634
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,344
The night we went
gambling, remember?

635
00:52:17,412 --> 00:52:19,346
We had dinner
at the hotel.

636
00:52:19,414 --> 00:52:21,848
Etta had roast beef,
and I had chicken.

637
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:23,851
If I can remember
what you had,

638
00:52:23,919 --> 00:52:25,147
I'll die happy.

639
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,152
Look out there.

640
00:52:26,221 --> 00:52:27,688
What?

641
00:52:27,756 --> 00:52:30,452
I got to talking to
some gambler that night.

642
00:52:30,526 --> 00:52:32,460
He told us
about an Indian...

643
00:52:32,528 --> 00:52:33,654
full-blooded Indian,

644
00:52:33,729 --> 00:52:35,458
except he used
an English name,

645
00:52:35,531 --> 00:52:37,328
Sir... somebody.

646
00:52:37,399 --> 00:52:38,388
Lord Baltimore?

647
00:52:38,467 --> 00:52:41,402
That's right, and he
could track anybody

648
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:43,495
over anything
day or night.

649
00:52:43,572 --> 00:52:45,506
So?

650
00:52:45,574 --> 00:52:48,771
The guy on the ground,
I think it's him.

651
00:52:54,082 --> 00:52:56,016
No. Baltimore works
out of Oklahoma.

652
00:52:56,084 --> 00:52:57,711
He's strictly
an Oklahoma man.

653
00:52:57,786 --> 00:53:00,220
I don't know
where we are,

654
00:53:00,289 --> 00:53:01,722
but it isn't Oklahoma.

655
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:03,655
Ah, it couldn't be him.

656
00:53:08,764 --> 00:53:10,322
It couldn't be him.

657
00:53:12,034 --> 00:53:13,194
I guess.

658
00:53:15,537 --> 00:53:16,970
Whoever it is,

659
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:19,872
it sure the hell
is somebody.

660
00:53:49,637 --> 00:53:50,968
Damn it!

661
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:54,475
Don't they get tired?
Don't they get hungry?

662
00:53:54,542 --> 00:53:55,975
They've gotta be.

663
00:53:56,044 --> 00:53:57,671
Why don't they
slow up?

664
00:53:57,745 --> 00:53:59,372
They could even
go faster.

665
00:53:59,447 --> 00:54:01,472
At least that'd
be a change.

666
00:54:01,549 --> 00:54:03,414
They don't even
break formation.

667
00:54:03,484 --> 00:54:04,416
Do something!

668
00:54:38,953 --> 00:54:40,614
Kid.

669
00:54:40,688 --> 00:54:42,485
What?

670
00:54:42,557 --> 00:54:44,081
Who's the best
lawman?

671
00:54:46,094 --> 00:54:47,061
Best? How?

672
00:54:47,128 --> 00:54:50,291
You mean toughest
or easiest to bribe?

673
00:54:50,365 --> 00:54:52,629
Toughest.

674
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,635
Joe LeFors.

675
00:54:55,703 --> 00:54:57,637
Gotta be.

676
00:55:01,809 --> 00:55:04,175
LeFors never leaves
Wyoming. Never.

677
00:55:04,245 --> 00:55:06,145
You know that.

678
00:55:06,214 --> 00:55:08,148
He always wears
a white skimmer.

679
00:55:08,216 --> 00:55:10,480
That's how you tell
it's Joe LeFors,

680
00:55:10,551 --> 00:55:13,816
'cause he wears
a white straw hat.

681
00:55:13,888 --> 00:55:17,585
Look at that guy
out front.

682
00:55:36,576 --> 00:55:38,976
Jesus, who are those guys?

683
00:55:43,917 --> 00:55:44,849
Hyah!

684
00:55:44,918 --> 00:55:46,647
Come on now.

685
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,415
Here you go, Kid.

686
00:56:32,532 --> 00:56:34,966
Go on! Get out of here!
Go on!

687
00:56:36,369 --> 00:56:38,633
What if they don't
follow the horse?

688
00:56:38,705 --> 00:56:40,036
You're the brains,
Butch.

689
00:56:40,107 --> 00:56:42,371
You'll think
of something.

690
00:58:09,229 --> 00:58:10,594
Damn it!

691
00:58:25,011 --> 00:58:26,444
The way I figure it,

692
00:58:26,513 --> 00:58:28,413
we can either fight
or give.

693
00:58:28,481 --> 00:58:30,415
If we give,
we go to jail.

694
00:58:30,483 --> 00:58:31,780
I've been there already.

695
00:58:31,852 --> 00:58:33,114
If we fight,

696
00:58:33,186 --> 00:58:34,778
they can stay
where they are

697
00:58:34,855 --> 00:58:36,186
and starve us out...

698
00:58:36,256 --> 00:58:38,486
or go for position,
shoot us.

699
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:40,822
Might even get
a rock slide started.

700
00:58:40,894 --> 00:58:42,521
What else can they do?

701
00:58:42,596 --> 00:58:44,223
They could surrender to us,

702
00:58:44,297 --> 00:58:46,731
but I wouldn't
count on that.

703
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,665
They're going for
position, all right.

704
00:58:48,735 --> 00:58:51,761
Better get ready.

705
00:58:54,908 --> 00:58:56,842
Kid, the next time
I say

706
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,844
let's go someplace
like Bolivia,

707
00:58:58,912 --> 00:59:00,345
let's go someplace
like Bolivia.

708
00:59:00,413 --> 00:59:01,710
Next time.

709
00:59:03,516 --> 00:59:04,676
Ready?

710
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:08,287
No. We'll jump.

711
00:59:12,993 --> 00:59:14,654
Like hell we will.

712
00:59:14,728 --> 00:59:16,161
No. It'll be O.K.

713
00:59:16,229 --> 00:59:17,856
if the water's
deep enough

714
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:19,899
and we don't get
squished to death.

715
00:59:19,966 --> 00:59:21,297
They'll never follow us.

716
00:59:21,368 --> 00:59:22,595
How do you know?

717
00:59:22,668 --> 00:59:25,102
Would you jump that
if you didn't have to?

718
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:27,104
I have to,
and I'm not gonna.

719
00:59:27,172 --> 00:59:29,106
We got to.
Otherwise we're dead.

720
00:59:29,174 --> 00:59:30,141
Come on.

721
00:59:30,209 --> 00:59:32,609
Just one clear shot...
that's all I want.

722
00:59:32,678 --> 00:59:34,612
I want to fight them!

723
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:36,113
They'll kill us.

724
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:37,113
Maybe.

725
00:59:37,182 --> 00:59:38,615
You want to die?

726
00:59:38,684 --> 00:59:40,982
Do you?

727
00:59:41,053 --> 00:59:43,317
All right,
I'll jump first.

728
00:59:43,389 --> 00:59:44,321
No.

729
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:45,823
Then you jump first.

730
00:59:45,891 --> 00:59:46,823
No, I said.

731
00:59:46,892 --> 00:59:47,881
What's the matter?

732
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,587
I can't swim!

733
00:59:59,538 --> 01:00:00,971
Why, you crazy?

734
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,474
The fall will
probably kill you.

735
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:14,482
Oh-oh...

736
01:00:14,553 --> 01:00:16,748
ohhh...

737
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:19,484
shiiiit!

738
01:00:26,765 --> 01:00:28,096
Hang on to me.

739
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:29,361
You're drowning me!

740
01:00:29,435 --> 01:00:31,300
I can't help it.
I can't swim.

741
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:32,803
You're choking me!

742
01:00:32,871 --> 01:00:34,304
I can't swim!

743
01:00:34,373 --> 01:00:35,635
I'm telling you,
if I drown,

744
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:38,370
I swear to God
I'll kill you.

745
01:00:38,444 --> 01:00:40,742
Never said I was
a great swimmer.

746
01:00:43,615 --> 01:00:46,550
Oh! You're choking me!

747
01:00:46,618 --> 01:00:49,382
Oh! I'm choking!

748
01:00:49,455 --> 01:00:50,888
Let go of me.

749
01:00:50,956 --> 01:00:53,424
I'm choking!

750
01:00:53,492 --> 01:00:55,460
Let go of my throat.

751
01:01:22,955 --> 01:01:24,923
The papers said
they had you.

752
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:28,187
Was it LeFors?
Did they say?

753
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,852
Joe LeFors?

754
01:01:29,929 --> 01:01:31,362
I think so.

755
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:32,863
And their tracker?

756
01:01:32,932 --> 01:01:33,864
Tracker?

757
01:01:33,933 --> 01:01:35,366
Was it Lord Baltimore?

758
01:01:35,434 --> 01:01:36,867
I think so.

759
01:01:36,936 --> 01:01:38,369
The paper's inside.

760
01:01:45,144 --> 01:01:47,578
You got enough
to feed us?

761
01:01:47,646 --> 01:01:50,376
Don't you know I do?

762
01:01:50,449 --> 01:01:52,178
They said you were dead.

763
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:55,186
Don't make a big thing
out of it.

764
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:00,625
No. Make a big thing
out of it.

765
01:02:05,164 --> 01:02:07,098
Hey.

766
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:10,499
It was Baltimore
and LeFors.

767
01:02:19,111 --> 01:02:20,237
You know who else?

768
01:02:20,312 --> 01:02:21,279
Who?

769
01:02:21,347 --> 01:02:22,780
Jeff Carr,
George Hiatt...

770
01:02:22,848 --> 01:02:23,780
Hiatt?

771
01:02:23,849 --> 01:02:25,282
T.T. Kelliher.

772
01:02:29,121 --> 01:02:31,612
We lucked out getting away.

773
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:32,987
You know that?

774
01:02:34,994 --> 01:02:36,518
Why would these guys
join up

775
01:02:36,595 --> 01:02:38,119
and take after us, though?

776
01:02:38,197 --> 01:02:40,131
Forget it.
Bunch like that

777
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:41,530
won't stay together
long.

778
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:42,532
They will...

779
01:02:42,601 --> 01:02:44,967
if Mr. Harriman
has his way.

780
01:02:45,037 --> 01:02:45,969
Who?

781
01:02:46,038 --> 01:02:47,096
Mr. E.H. Harriman

782
01:02:47,172 --> 01:02:48,537
of the Union Pacific
Railroad.

783
01:02:48,607 --> 01:02:51,542
He resents the way you've
been picking on him,

784
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:53,544
so he's outfitted
a special train

785
01:02:53,612 --> 01:02:55,546
and hired
special employees.

786
01:02:55,614 --> 01:02:57,548
You've been avoiding them
for two days.

787
01:02:57,616 --> 01:02:59,049
It's really
sort of flattering

788
01:02:59,118 --> 01:03:01,552
if you want to think
about it that way.

789
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,554
A setup like that
costs more

790
01:03:03,622 --> 01:03:05,055
than we ever took.

791
01:03:05,124 --> 01:03:06,557
Apparently
he can afford it.

792
01:03:09,128 --> 01:03:10,720
That crazy Harriman.

793
01:03:13,132 --> 01:03:14,565
That's bad business.

794
01:03:14,633 --> 01:03:15,998
How long
do you think

795
01:03:16,068 --> 01:03:17,501
I'd stay
in operation

796
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:19,504
if every job
cost me money?

797
01:03:19,572 --> 01:03:22,006
If he'd just pay me
what he's spending

798
01:03:22,074 --> 01:03:24,008
to make me
stop robbing him,

799
01:03:24,076 --> 01:03:25,508
I'd stop
robbing him.

800
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,014
You probably inherited
every penny you got!

801
01:03:31,082 --> 01:03:32,014
Inherited guys,

802
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:34,017
what the hell
do they know?

803
01:03:34,085 --> 01:03:36,349
You say they were
hired permanent?

804
01:03:36,421 --> 01:03:39,356
No. Just till
they kill you.

805
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,864
That means they're still
after us, Butch,

806
01:03:51,936 --> 01:03:54,234
and it's going to be
the same thing

807
01:03:54,305 --> 01:03:55,704
all over again.

808
01:03:59,611 --> 01:04:01,545
They'll show up here...

809
01:04:01,613 --> 01:04:03,046
sooner or later.

810
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:20,996
Hey, Etta.

811
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:24,501
I'll get you
some more.

812
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:28,005
Butch and me have been
talking it all over.

813
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:30,006
Wherever the hell
Bolivia is,

814
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:32,008
that's where we're off to.

815
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:34,510
We'll go down there
and play it safe,

816
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:37,013
maybe keep our hand in
a little bit.

817
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,514
Butch speaks some Spanish.

818
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,017
I can wrestle
with a menu O.K.

819
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:43,019
And you speak it good.

820
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:48,025
And it'd be good cover
going with a woman.

821
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:50,026
No one expects it.

822
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,530
Then we could
travel safer.

823
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,532
What I'm saying is,

824
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,034
if you want to go,

825
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,535
I won't stop you,

826
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,538
but the minute
you start to whine

827
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,039
or make a nuisance,

828
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:05,041
I don't care
where we are,

829
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:06,542
I'm dumping you flat.

830
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:08,545
Don't sugarcoat it
like that, Kid.

831
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,046
Tell her straight.

832
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,485
I'm 26, and I'm single

833
01:05:17,555 --> 01:05:18,988
and a schoolteacher,

834
01:05:19,057 --> 01:05:21,992
and that's the
bottom of the pit.

835
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:23,994
And the only excitement
I've known

836
01:05:24,062 --> 01:05:25,495
is here with me now.

837
01:05:25,563 --> 01:05:26,996
So I'll go with you,

838
01:05:27,065 --> 01:05:28,498
and I won't whine,

839
01:05:28,566 --> 01:05:29,999
and I'll sew
your socks,

840
01:05:30,068 --> 01:05:32,502
and I'll stitch you
when you're wounded,

841
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:35,004
and I'll do anything
you ask of me

842
01:05:35,073 --> 01:05:36,506
except one thing.

843
01:05:36,574 --> 01:05:38,508
I won't watch you die.

844
01:05:38,576 --> 01:05:40,009
I'll miss that scene,

845
01:05:40,078 --> 01:05:41,511
if you don't mind.

846
01:06:15,613 --> 01:06:16,978
The future's all yours,

847
01:06:17,048 --> 01:06:18,982
you lousy bicycles.

848
01:11:23,519 --> 01:11:26,454
Well, you know,
it could be worse.

849
01:11:26,522 --> 01:11:30,151
You get a lot more
for your money in Bolivia.

850
01:11:30,225 --> 01:11:31,658
I checked on it.

851
01:11:31,726 --> 01:11:33,159
What could they have here

852
01:11:33,228 --> 01:11:36,459
that you could possibly
want to buy?

853
01:11:40,535 --> 01:11:42,969
Jeez, all Bolivia
can't look like this.

854
01:11:43,038 --> 01:11:44,630
How do you know?

855
01:11:44,706 --> 01:11:46,970
This might be
the garden spot

856
01:11:47,042 --> 01:11:48,475
of the whole country.

857
01:11:48,543 --> 01:11:50,477
People may travel
hundreds of miles

858
01:11:50,545 --> 01:11:52,479
just to get to this spot

859
01:11:52,547 --> 01:11:53,809
where we're standing now.

860
01:11:53,882 --> 01:11:55,816
This might be
the Atlantic City, New Jersey,

861
01:11:55,884 --> 01:11:57,818
of all Bolivia
for all you know.

862
01:11:57,886 --> 01:11:59,319
I know more
about Bolivia

863
01:11:59,387 --> 01:12:01,321
than you know about
Atlantic City, New Jersey,

864
01:12:01,389 --> 01:12:02,720
I can tell you that.

865
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:04,986
Aha!

866
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:07,494
You do, huh?

867
01:12:07,562 --> 01:12:09,496
I was born there.

868
01:12:09,564 --> 01:12:11,998
I was born
in New Jersey...

869
01:12:12,067 --> 01:12:14,035
brought up there, so...

870
01:12:14,102 --> 01:12:15,592
I didn't know that.

871
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:18,002
The total tonnage
of what you don't know

872
01:12:18,073 --> 01:12:19,506
is enough to shatter...

873
01:12:19,574 --> 01:12:20,734
We're not
accomplishing

874
01:12:20,809 --> 01:12:22,003
as much as we might.

875
01:12:22,077 --> 01:12:24,511
Listen, your job
is to back me up,

876
01:12:24,579 --> 01:12:26,274
because you'd starve
without me.

877
01:12:27,749 --> 01:12:30,013
And you,
your job is to shut up.

878
01:12:34,589 --> 01:12:36,022
He'll feel a lot better

879
01:12:36,091 --> 01:12:38,525
after he's robbed
a couple of banks.

880
01:12:39,761 --> 01:12:42,025
Ha ha ha ha!

881
01:12:44,099 --> 01:12:45,532
Bolivia.

882
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:56,543
Hell,
it's just a bank

883
01:12:56,611 --> 01:12:58,044
like any other bank.

884
01:12:58,113 --> 01:13:00,047
You got to
move in slowly,

885
01:13:00,115 --> 01:13:01,548
check out
everything.

886
01:13:01,616 --> 01:13:03,049
The thing
to remember...

887
01:13:03,118 --> 01:13:05,552
Don't tell me
how to rob a bank.

888
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:08,054
I know how
to rob a bank.

889
01:13:08,123 --> 01:13:10,557
A few dark clouds
appear on your horizon,

890
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:13,560
and you just go all
to pieces, don't you?

891
01:13:33,081 --> 01:13:34,514
<i>Buenos días, señores.</i>

892
01:13:34,582 --> 01:13:36,072
<i>¿Les puedo servir
en algo?</i>

893
01:13:36,151 --> 01:13:39,018
<i>Ordenen para atenderlos
por favor inmediatamente.</i>

894
01:13:41,089 --> 01:13:43,023
<i>¿Quieren hacer
algún depósito?</i>

895
01:13:45,093 --> 01:13:46,526
<i>¿Quieren abrir
una cuenta?</i>

896
01:13:46,594 --> 01:13:49,028
<i>Bien, el cajero los
atienda inmediatamente.</i>

897
01:13:49,097 --> 01:13:51,031
<i>Los atendemos por todo.</i>

898
01:13:57,105 --> 01:13:58,538
<i>Señor?</i>

899
01:14:09,884 --> 01:14:11,044
<i>Adiós.</i>

900
01:14:12,554 --> 01:14:14,545
This is a robbery.

901
01:14:14,622 --> 01:14:16,988
<i>Esto es un robo.</i>

902
01:14:17,058 --> 01:14:19,993
<i>Esto es un robo.</i>

903
01:14:25,066 --> 01:14:27,500
This is supposed to be
a unison recitation.

904
01:14:27,569 --> 01:14:30,003
Why do I have to
do any of this?

905
01:14:30,071 --> 01:14:31,504
He's the one

906
01:14:31,573 --> 01:14:33,507
who claimed he knew
the language.

907
01:14:33,575 --> 01:14:35,509
Your line of work requires
a specialized vocabulary.

908
01:14:35,577 --> 01:14:38,239
I got nervous. I forgot
the words. Shoot me.

909
01:14:38,313 --> 01:14:40,372
You've had
worse ideas lately.

910
01:14:40,448 --> 01:14:42,006
Raise
your hands.

911
01:14:43,585 --> 01:14:46,019
<i>Uh... las manos arriba.</i>

912
01:14:46,087 --> 01:14:47,520
Raise them.

913
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:50,523
<i>Arriba.</i>

914
01:14:50,592 --> 01:14:53,527
All of you back
against the wall.

915
01:14:53,595 --> 01:14:58,032
<i>Todos ustedes, um...</i>

916
01:14:58,099 --> 01:15:01,535
<i>arrímense a la pared.</i>

917
01:15:01,603 --> 01:15:03,537
Give me the money.

918
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:11,772
Give me the money.

919
01:15:11,846 --> 01:15:14,041
Give me the money.

920
01:15:14,115 --> 01:15:15,980
This is not
going to work,

921
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:18,484
and we're going to be
up all night

922
01:15:18,553 --> 01:15:19,986
until you get this.

923
01:15:20,054 --> 01:15:21,988
Now give me the money.

924
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,994
It's on the tip
of my tongue, Etta.

925
01:15:28,062 --> 01:15:29,495
I swear it.

926
01:15:31,566 --> 01:15:34,056
Butch, are you still
thinking in there?

927
01:15:34,134 --> 01:15:37,103
What the hell else
is there to do?

928
01:15:37,171 --> 01:15:39,503
Try this one.

929
01:15:39,573 --> 01:15:42,201
Where is the safe?
Open it.

930
01:15:42,276 --> 01:15:44,005
<i>Dónde es...</i>

931
01:15:48,081 --> 01:15:50,515
Uh, that's a hard one.

932
01:15:53,086 --> 01:15:55,748
<i>¿Dónde está la caja?
¡Ábrala!</i>

933
01:15:55,822 --> 01:15:58,586
That's very good, Butch.

934
01:15:58,659 --> 01:16:01,025
You're a good teacher,
Etta.

935
01:16:02,663 --> 01:16:04,096
<i>¡Esto es un robo!</i>

936
01:16:10,037 --> 01:16:12,505
<i>Manos a...</i>

937
01:16:12,573 --> 01:16:14,473
<i>Manos, um...</i>

938
01:16:21,381 --> 01:16:23,246
<i>¡Manos arriba!</i>

939
01:16:23,317 --> 01:16:25,114
They got them up!
Skip down!

940
01:16:25,185 --> 01:16:26,777
<i>- ¡Arriba!
- Skip on down!</i>

941
01:16:26,853 --> 01:16:30,311
<i>Todos ustedes arrísmense
a la pared.</i>

942
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:32,449
They're against
the wall already!

943
01:16:32,526 --> 01:16:33,458
<i>Dónde es...</i>

944
01:16:33,527 --> 01:16:34,960
Oh, you're so damn smart,

945
01:16:35,028 --> 01:16:36,495
you read it.

946
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:46,672
A goddamn crib sheet.

947
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:48,173
You almost blew it.

948
01:16:48,242 --> 01:16:49,675
You sure didn't help much.

949
01:16:49,743 --> 01:16:52,678
You can't do anything
without a crib sheet.

950
01:17:08,128 --> 01:17:11,029
For God's sake,
don't drop the money!

951
01:17:11,098 --> 01:17:13,066
I won't drop the money!

952
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:14,532
<i>Voy a traer
el comisario.</i>

953
01:17:14,601 --> 01:17:15,829
<i>Sí, vamos.</i>

954
01:17:15,902 --> 01:17:16,766
<i>Ay, nombre.</i>

955
01:17:16,837 --> 01:17:17,769
<i>Evarista.</i>

956
01:17:17,838 --> 01:17:18,964
<i>¿Evarista qué?</i>

957
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:20,301
<i>Señor comandante,</i>

958
01:17:20,374 --> 01:17:22,968
<i>dos hombres acometen
y asaltan el banco.</i>

959
01:17:23,043 --> 01:17:24,806
<i>Dos yanquis
y una muchacha</i>

960
01:17:24,878 --> 01:17:26,641
<i>se fueron por la cañada.</i>

961
01:17:26,713 --> 01:17:28,977
<i>Se llevaron mi pistola
y todo el dinero.</i>

962
01:17:29,049 --> 01:17:29,981
<i>Vámanos!</i>

963
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:30,982
<i>A caballos!</i>

964
01:18:23,437 --> 01:18:25,234
Isn't that
a pretty sight?

965
01:18:28,141 --> 01:18:30,473
Well, we're back in business,
boys and girls,

966
01:18:30,544 --> 01:18:31,977
just like the old days.

967
01:22:59,711 --> 01:23:01,542
Let's stay here
and get him

968
01:23:01,613 --> 01:23:03,046
and be done with it.

969
01:23:03,114 --> 01:23:04,547
But what if
we lose?

970
01:23:04,616 --> 01:23:06,550
We saw him
with two guys.

971
01:23:06,618 --> 01:23:08,051
What if he's got 20?

972
01:23:08,119 --> 01:23:10,553
You don't know for sure
it's LeFors.

973
01:23:10,622 --> 01:23:12,556
I'm a hell of a guesser.

974
01:23:12,624 --> 01:23:14,558
He can't arrest you.
It's a foreign country.

975
01:23:14,626 --> 01:23:15,991
He can't take you back.

976
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,994
He's not going to
take anybody back.

977
01:23:18,062 --> 01:23:19,996
He's going to
wait for us

978
01:23:20,064 --> 01:23:21,497
to pull
another job

979
01:23:21,566 --> 01:23:22,999
and then
hunt us down.

980
01:23:23,067 --> 01:23:24,500
Let's finish it now,
Butch,

981
01:23:24,569 --> 01:23:26,002
one way
or the other.

982
01:23:27,572 --> 01:23:29,506
He's got to wait for us

983
01:23:29,574 --> 01:23:31,007
to pull another job.

984
01:23:32,577 --> 01:23:35,011
Well, what if there isn't
another job?

985
01:23:35,079 --> 01:23:36,512
He can't arrest us,

986
01:23:36,581 --> 01:23:39,014
and he can't take us
out of here.

987
01:23:39,082 --> 01:23:40,515
We'll drive him crazy.

988
01:23:40,584 --> 01:23:42,017
We'll outlast
the bastard.

989
01:23:42,085 --> 01:23:43,347
We'll go straight.

990
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:45,513
So you want jobs.

991
01:23:45,589 --> 01:23:48,524
You're from the U.S. of A.,

992
01:23:48,592 --> 01:23:51,026
and you are seeking
after employment.

993
01:23:51,094 --> 01:23:53,028
Well, you couldn't
have picked

994
01:23:53,096 --> 01:23:55,530
a more
out of the way place

995
01:23:55,599 --> 01:23:57,032
in all of Bolivia,

996
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,533
I'll tell you that.

997
01:23:58,602 --> 01:24:00,536
<i>Gracias, Jesús.</i>

998
01:24:00,604 --> 01:24:03,539
Ordinarily
you've got to wait

999
01:24:03,607 --> 01:24:05,541
to work for
Percy Garrison,

1000
01:24:05,609 --> 01:24:07,543
but this ain't
ordinarily.

1001
01:24:07,611 --> 01:24:08,543
Bingo.

1002
01:24:08,612 --> 01:24:10,546
You mean there are jobs.

1003
01:24:10,614 --> 01:24:12,047
Yes, there are jobs.

1004
01:24:12,115 --> 01:24:13,548
There are lots
of jobs.

1005
01:24:13,617 --> 01:24:15,551
Don't you want to
know why?

1006
01:24:15,619 --> 01:24:16,677
Yeah, why?

1007
01:24:17,854 --> 01:24:19,481
Damn it.

1008
01:24:19,556 --> 01:24:22,992
Because I cannot
promise to pay you.

1009
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:25,324
Don't you want to
know why?

1010
01:24:26,463 --> 01:24:27,987
OK, why?

1011
01:24:29,566 --> 01:24:32,501
On account of
the payroll thieves,

1012
01:24:32,569 --> 01:24:34,002
fellow citizens.

1013
01:24:34,071 --> 01:24:36,005
You see,
every mine around

1014
01:24:36,073 --> 01:24:38,007
gets its payroll

1015
01:24:38,075 --> 01:24:39,508
from La Paz.

1016
01:24:39,576 --> 01:24:41,009
And every
mine around

1017
01:24:41,078 --> 01:24:43,512
gets its payroll
held up.

1018
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:49,018
Some say it's the
Bolivian Bandits,

1019
01:24:49,086 --> 01:24:50,519
and some say

1020
01:24:50,587 --> 01:24:54,023
<i>that it's the
bandidos yanquis.</i>

1021
01:24:54,091 --> 01:24:55,524
Could I see that?

1022
01:24:58,895 --> 01:25:01,022
Mm-hmm.

1023
01:25:01,098 --> 01:25:03,032
Fairly nice-looking
piece.

1024
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:05,534
Can you hit
anything?

1025
01:25:05,602 --> 01:25:07,035
Sometimes.

1026
01:25:16,046 --> 01:25:17,513
Hit that.

1027
01:25:23,553 --> 01:25:25,487
No, no, son.
No, son.

1028
01:25:25,555 --> 01:25:27,489
I just want to know,

1029
01:25:27,557 --> 01:25:29,991
can you shoot
your piece?

1030
01:25:32,729 --> 01:25:33,661
Shoot.

1031
01:25:44,808 --> 01:25:46,503
Damn it.

1032
01:25:46,576 --> 01:25:48,510
Can I move?

1033
01:25:48,578 --> 01:25:49,510
Move?

1034
01:25:49,579 --> 01:25:52,070
What the hell
you mean, move?

1035
01:25:57,087 --> 01:25:59,021
I'm better
when I move.

1036
01:25:59,089 --> 01:26:00,351
Yeah.

1037
01:26:01,591 --> 01:26:03,525
Well, considering
that I'm desperate

1038
01:26:03,593 --> 01:26:06,027
and you're just what
I'm looking for,

1039
01:26:06,096 --> 01:26:07,529
on top of which

1040
01:26:07,597 --> 01:26:10,031
you stem
from the U.S. of A.,

1041
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:11,533
we start
tomorrow morning.

1042
01:26:11,601 --> 01:26:13,535
You mean we got jobs.

1043
01:26:13,603 --> 01:26:15,036
Payroll guard.

1044
01:26:15,105 --> 01:26:15,969
Damn.

1045
01:26:16,039 --> 01:26:17,973
<i>Vámanos
a trabajar!</i>

1046
01:26:18,041 --> 01:26:19,303
Hey, Chucho!

1047
01:26:19,376 --> 01:26:20,468
Chucho!

1048
01:26:52,275 --> 01:26:54,505
I think they're in
the trees up ahead.

1049
01:26:54,578 --> 01:26:56,512
In the bushes
on the left.

1050
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:58,514
They're in the trees
up ahead.

1051
01:26:58,582 --> 01:27:00,015
You take the trees,

1052
01:27:00,083 --> 01:27:01,516
I'll take
the bushes.

1053
01:27:01,585 --> 01:27:04,179
Will you two beginners
cut it out?

1054
01:27:04,254 --> 01:27:07,052
Well, we're just trying
to spot an ambush.

1055
01:27:07,123 --> 01:27:09,023
Morons.

1056
01:27:09,092 --> 01:27:12,027
I've got morons
on my team.

1057
01:27:12,095 --> 01:27:14,529
Nobody is going to
rob us

1058
01:27:14,598 --> 01:27:15,963
going down the mountain.

1059
01:27:16,032 --> 01:27:17,966
We have got no money

1060
01:27:18,034 --> 01:27:19,503
going down the mountain.

1061
01:27:19,636 --> 01:27:22,469
When we have got
the money

1062
01:27:22,539 --> 01:27:24,336
on the way back,

1063
01:27:24,407 --> 01:27:25,965
then you can sweat.

1064
01:27:26,042 --> 01:27:27,600
Bingo.

1065
01:27:27,677 --> 01:27:28,974
Move it out!

1066
01:27:30,046 --> 01:27:31,013
Move it!

1067
01:27:54,069 --> 01:27:57,004
We hit this place
in June, didn't we?

1068
01:28:09,385 --> 01:28:11,012
Jones!

1069
01:28:11,086 --> 01:28:13,350
Give me a hand
over here.

1070
01:28:13,422 --> 01:28:15,947
Who am I,
Smith or Jones?

1071
01:28:16,025 --> 01:28:17,458
Live.

1072
01:28:34,543 --> 01:28:36,477
About
a half hour more,

1073
01:28:36,545 --> 01:28:38,979
and we can start
to worry...

1074
01:28:39,048 --> 01:28:40,481
as soon as we get

1075
01:28:40,549 --> 01:28:41,982
to that pass
up there.

1076
01:28:42,051 --> 01:28:44,485
We'll be all right
till then.

1077
01:28:44,553 --> 01:28:46,487
They might
try something here.

1078
01:28:46,555 --> 01:28:48,523
No. Better cover
up there.

1079
01:28:50,559 --> 01:28:52,993
You got to relax,
you fellas.

1080
01:28:53,062 --> 01:28:56,156
You got to get used
to Bolivian ways.

1081
01:28:56,231 --> 01:28:58,165
You got to go easy.

1082
01:28:58,233 --> 01:28:59,165
Damn it!

1083
01:28:59,234 --> 01:29:00,667
Like I do.

1084
01:29:00,736 --> 01:29:03,671
Of course, you probably
think I'm crazy,

1085
01:29:03,739 --> 01:29:05,502
but I'm not.

1086
01:29:05,574 --> 01:29:07,007
Bingo.

1087
01:29:07,076 --> 01:29:08,008
I'm colorful.

1088
01:29:08,077 --> 01:29:09,510
That's what happens

1089
01:29:09,578 --> 01:29:12,172
when you live 10 years
alone in Bolivia.

1090
01:29:12,247 --> 01:29:13,874
You get colorful.

1091
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:34,968
Where are they?

1092
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,065
I can't see them.

1093
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:56,023
Let's get
out of here.

1094
01:31:29,384 --> 01:31:32,319
Tell them to leave
the money and go.

1095
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:36,283
<i>Dijen el dinoro...</i>

1096
01:31:36,358 --> 01:31:38,792
<i>Dinero...
and, uh...</i>

1097
01:31:38,861 --> 01:31:40,385
<i>y váyanese.</i>

1098
01:31:42,097 --> 01:31:45,065
<i>¿Que dejemos el dinero
y nos vayamos?</i>

1099
01:31:45,133 --> 01:31:46,896
Tell them
we were hired

1100
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:50,131
to take it back.
It's our job.

1101
01:31:50,204 --> 01:31:52,638
Tell them the money
isn't ours.

1102
01:31:54,275 --> 01:31:55,674
<i>El dinero...</i>

1103
01:31:55,743 --> 01:31:57,370
<i>no es nuestro.</i>

1104
01:31:57,445 --> 01:31:59,879
<i>No, ya no es de ustedes.</i>

1105
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:01,380
<i>Ahora es de nosotros.</i>

1106
01:32:01,449 --> 01:32:02,575
<i>Claro.</i>

1107
01:32:04,385 --> 01:32:07,286
We'll try
telling them again.

1108
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:11,451
It's our job.
The money isn't ours.

1109
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:14,825
<i>El dinero
no es nuestro.</i>

1110
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:16,625
<i>Lo necesitamos.</i>

1111
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:19,188
<i>También nosotros
necesitamos.</i>

1112
01:32:20,635 --> 01:32:22,068
What do you think?

1113
01:32:22,136 --> 01:32:23,603
Not so good.

1114
01:32:23,671 --> 01:32:25,571
Can you take the two
on the right?

1115
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,768
Kid, there's something
I think I ought to tell you.

1116
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:30,777
I never shot
anybody before.

1117
01:32:35,683 --> 01:32:38,777
One hell of a time
to tell me.

1118
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:46,426
Try for the two
on the right

1119
01:32:46,494 --> 01:32:47,426
dead center.

1120
01:32:47,495 --> 01:32:49,429
That way, if you
miss a little,

1121
01:32:49,497 --> 01:32:50,930
you'll still
hit something.

1122
01:32:50,998 --> 01:32:52,795
Go.

1123
01:32:52,867 --> 01:32:53,799
Please.

1124
01:32:53,868 --> 01:32:55,392
<i>¿Qué?</i>

1125
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:56,731
<i>Por favor.</i>

1126
01:32:56,804 --> 01:32:58,328
<i>¿Por favor?</i>

1127
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:10,748
Aah!

1128
01:33:46,487 --> 01:33:48,546
Well,
we've gone straight.

1129
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:54,022
What'll we try now?

1130
01:34:11,311 --> 01:34:14,246
There are other ways of
going straight, you know.

1131
01:34:28,628 --> 01:34:31,062
There are other ways
of going straight.

1132
01:34:34,501 --> 01:34:35,763
There's farming.

1133
01:34:39,172 --> 01:34:41,106
We could buy a place.

1134
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:44,809
I don't know
how to farm.

1135
01:34:48,348 --> 01:34:50,282
What about a ranch,
then?

1136
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:52,409
I don't know.

1137
01:34:52,485 --> 01:34:54,919
The last time
we tried ranching

1138
01:34:54,988 --> 01:34:56,922
was during
our rustling days.

1139
01:34:56,990 --> 01:34:57,922
Even then,

1140
01:34:57,991 --> 01:35:00,425
we weren't much good
at it.

1141
01:35:00,493 --> 01:35:02,427
It's hard.
Hours are brutal.

1142
01:35:02,495 --> 01:35:04,929
No, you got to be
a kid

1143
01:35:04,998 --> 01:35:06,431
to start a ranch.

1144
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:22,348
Hey.

1145
01:35:22,415 --> 01:35:23,439
Hmm?

1146
01:35:27,220 --> 01:35:30,155
I might go back
ahead of you.

1147
01:35:36,563 --> 01:35:38,360
You mean home?

1148
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,334
I was thinking of it.

1149
01:35:47,873 --> 01:35:49,602
Whatever you want, Etta.

1150
01:35:54,279 --> 01:35:55,712
Maybe I'll go.

1151
01:36:05,357 --> 01:36:06,688
Hey.

1152
01:36:06,759 --> 01:36:07,953
Hmm?

1153
01:36:08,026 --> 01:36:09,459
Etta's thinking of, uh,

1154
01:36:09,528 --> 01:36:11,655
maybe going home
ahead of us.

1155
01:36:15,167 --> 01:36:16,725
Whatever she wants.

1156
01:36:19,304 --> 01:36:20,737
I'll go, then.

1157
01:36:59,011 --> 01:37:00,444
<i>¡Manos arriba!</i>

1158
01:37:01,513 --> 01:37:02,946
How much you got?

1159
01:37:03,015 --> 01:37:05,449
It's hardly worth it.
Alpoca mine.

1160
01:37:05,517 --> 01:37:07,951
I tell you, no more
jungle work for me.

1161
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:10,454
You're getting
to be an old maid.

1162
01:37:10,522 --> 01:37:12,956
Keep your old maid
remarks to yourself.

1163
01:37:13,025 --> 01:37:15,459
I'll work in the city,
in the mountains,

1164
01:37:15,527 --> 01:37:18,155
but from now on
jungle work is out.

1165
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:19,162
<i>¿Bandidos yanquis?</i>

1166
01:37:19,231 --> 01:37:20,289
Mm-hmm.

1167
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,434
Tell them to be quiet.

1168
01:37:23,502 --> 01:37:24,935
What's the word?

1169
01:37:25,003 --> 01:37:25,935
<i>Quietas.</i>

1170
01:37:26,004 --> 01:37:26,936
<i>Quietas.</i>

1171
01:37:36,915 --> 01:37:38,348
I tell you,

1172
01:37:38,417 --> 01:37:40,851
the jungle's a better
cover for payrolls.

1173
01:37:40,919 --> 01:37:43,353
Kid, I got a right
to my opinion,

1174
01:37:43,422 --> 01:37:44,855
and in my opinion,

1175
01:37:44,923 --> 01:37:46,356
there are snakes
in the jungle.

1176
01:37:46,425 --> 01:37:47,983
I don't work
around snakes.

1177
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:49,493
What is this place?

1178
01:37:50,796 --> 01:37:51,990
I don't know.

1179
01:37:52,064 --> 01:37:53,725
San Vincente,
I think.

1180
01:37:53,799 --> 01:37:54,731
<i>¿Comer?</i>

1181
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:55,732
<i>Si, Señor.</i>

1182
01:37:55,801 --> 01:37:57,234
<i>Pasen.
Juan, ven.</i>

1183
01:37:57,302 --> 01:37:59,736
<i>Llévate los caballos.</i>

1184
01:38:24,997 --> 01:38:27,431
I don't enjoy jungles.
I don't enjoy swamps.

1185
01:38:27,499 --> 01:38:28,932
I don't like snakes.

1186
01:38:29,001 --> 01:38:30,935
I don't much care
for night work.

1187
01:38:31,003 --> 01:38:32,265
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

1188
01:38:33,472 --> 01:38:34,439
<i>¡Capitán! ¡Capitán!</i>

1189
01:38:34,506 --> 01:38:36,440
<i>Capitán,
allá en la plaza,</i>

1190
01:38:36,508 --> 01:38:39,443
<i>hay una mula
de las minas de Alpoca.</i>

1191
01:38:39,511 --> 01:38:40,944
<i>¿Las minas de Alpoca?</i>

1192
01:38:41,013 --> 01:38:42,446
<i>Sí, sí. Allí están.</i>

1193
01:38:42,514 --> 01:38:44,448
<i>Dos hombres la acaban
de traer.</i>

1194
01:38:44,516 --> 01:38:46,211
<i>Están comiendo en el
restaurante de mi papá.</i>

1195
01:38:46,285 --> 01:38:48,879
<i>El guisado
está delicioso.</i>

1196
01:38:48,954 --> 01:38:51,388
<i>Para chuparse
los dedos.</i>

1197
01:38:51,456 --> 01:38:54,391
<i>Si quieren mas, es
la especialidad de la casa,</i>

1198
01:38:54,459 --> 01:38:55,892
<i>si quieren mas,</i>

1199
01:38:55,961 --> 01:38:57,394
<i>no tengan pena
y díganmelo.</i>

1200
01:38:57,462 --> 01:38:59,396
<i>Yo estoy aquí
para servirles.</i>

1201
01:38:59,464 --> 01:39:04,424
<i>Agradezco la visita de tan
distinguidos caballeros.</i>

1202
01:39:04,503 --> 01:39:05,435
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

1203
01:39:05,504 --> 01:39:06,872
<i>Para servirles.</i>

1204
01:39:07,005 --> 01:39:07,801
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

1205
01:39:07,873 --> 01:39:08,805
<i>Sí.</i>

1206
01:39:11,977 --> 01:39:13,911
The specialty
of the house,

1207
01:39:13,979 --> 01:39:15,412
and it's
still moving.

1208
01:39:22,454 --> 01:39:23,887
Well, that settles it.

1209
01:39:23,955 --> 01:39:26,389
This place gets no more
of my business.

1210
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,662
Hey.

1211
01:39:36,735 --> 01:39:37,759
What?

1212
01:39:37,836 --> 01:39:41,135
What do you think?
I bet it's just one guy.

1213
01:39:49,614 --> 01:39:52,810
Don't you get sick of
being right all the time?

1214
01:40:22,212 --> 01:40:23,509
Reloading.

1215
01:40:26,717 --> 01:40:28,150
That's all I got.

1216
01:40:32,122 --> 01:40:33,555
We're going to run out

1217
01:40:33,624 --> 01:40:37,355
unless we can get to that
mule and get some more.

1218
01:40:41,732 --> 01:40:43,063
I'll go.

1219
01:40:43,133 --> 01:40:46,261
This is no time for bravery.
I'll let you.

1220
01:40:48,605 --> 01:40:49,594
Loaded.

1221
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:57,777
Hell!

1222
01:40:57,848 --> 01:41:00,282
I'm the one
that has to go.

1223
01:41:01,719 --> 01:41:02,947
Why you?

1224
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:05,250
'Cause I could never
give you cover.

1225
01:41:05,322 --> 01:41:07,256
You can cover me.

1226
01:41:08,959 --> 01:41:11,951
You can see I'm right,
can't you?

1227
01:41:19,136 --> 01:41:20,694
You go.

1228
01:41:20,771 --> 01:41:23,467
Yeah, why am I always
so damn smart?

1229
01:41:30,247 --> 01:41:31,179
Here.

1230
01:41:39,323 --> 01:41:40,255
Go.

1231
01:41:57,975 --> 01:41:58,907
O.K.

1232
01:42:38,782 --> 01:42:39,714
Go.

1233
01:43:40,577 --> 01:43:41,509
Ah!

1234
01:44:25,454 --> 01:44:28,821
Is... Is that what you call
giving cover?

1235
01:44:28,891 --> 01:44:31,826
Is that what
you call running?

1236
01:44:31,894 --> 01:44:34,829
If I knew you were
going to stroll...

1237
01:44:35,898 --> 01:44:37,331
You never could shoot,

1238
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:39,334
not from
the very beginning.

1239
01:44:45,374 --> 01:44:47,308
And you are all mouth.

1240
01:44:56,018 --> 01:44:57,849
<i>Jefe, llega el ejército.</i>

1241
01:45:09,599 --> 01:45:10,531
<i>Mi capitán.</i>

1242
01:45:12,335 --> 01:45:13,267
<i>¿Dónde están?</i>

1243
01:45:13,336 --> 01:45:14,769
<i>Allí en la plaza.</i>

1244
01:45:14,837 --> 01:45:16,202
<i>¿Cuántos hombres son?</i>

1245
01:45:16,272 --> 01:45:17,204
<i>Dos hombres.</i>

1246
01:45:17,273 --> 01:45:18,205
<i>¿Dos hombres?</i>

1247
01:45:18,274 --> 01:45:19,707
<i>Mi capitán,
por favor...</i>

1248
01:45:19,775 --> 01:45:20,707
<i>¿Dos?</i>

1249
01:45:20,776 --> 01:45:21,970
<i>Bandidos yanquis.</i>

1250
01:45:22,044 --> 01:45:23,477
<i>¿Bandidos yanquis, eh?</i>

1251
01:45:23,546 --> 01:45:24,979
<i>Sí, mi capitán.</i>

1252
01:45:25,047 --> 01:45:25,979
Hmm.

1253
01:45:26,048 --> 01:45:27,481
<i>Sargento Rico,</i>

1254
01:45:27,550 --> 01:45:29,017
<i>desmonten 20 hombres</i>

1255
01:45:29,085 --> 01:45:30,985
<i>y vayan con el teniente.</i>

1256
01:46:44,661 --> 01:46:47,596
I've got a great idea
where we should go next.

1257
01:46:47,664 --> 01:46:49,598
I don't want
to hear it.

1258
01:46:49,666 --> 01:46:51,099
You'll change your mind.

1259
01:46:51,167 --> 01:46:52,099
Shut up!

1260
01:46:52,168 --> 01:46:53,100
OK, O.K.

1261
01:46:53,169 --> 01:46:54,602
Your ideas
got us here.

1262
01:46:54,671 --> 01:46:55,763
Forget it!

1263
01:46:55,839 --> 01:46:58,774
I never want to hear
another of your ideas.

1264
01:46:58,842 --> 01:46:59,774
All right.

1265
01:46:59,843 --> 01:47:00,775
O.K.

1266
01:47:10,253 --> 01:47:11,481
Australia.

1267
01:47:14,390 --> 01:47:17,257
I figured secretly
you wanted to know,

1268
01:47:17,327 --> 01:47:18,760
so I told you.

1269
01:47:18,828 --> 01:47:19,954
Australia.

1270
01:47:21,698 --> 01:47:23,131
That's your great idea?

1271
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:25,133
Oh, boy,
it's the latest in...

1272
01:47:25,201 --> 01:47:26,634
in a long line.

1273
01:47:26,703 --> 01:47:28,637
Australia's
no better than here.

1274
01:47:28,705 --> 01:47:30,138
Aw, that's all you know.

1275
01:47:30,206 --> 01:47:31,639
Name me one thing.

1276
01:47:31,708 --> 01:47:33,642
They speak English
in Australia.

1277
01:47:33,710 --> 01:47:34,642
They do?

1278
01:47:34,711 --> 01:47:36,144
That's right, smart guy.

1279
01:47:36,212 --> 01:47:37,645
So we wouldn't be
foreigners.

1280
01:47:39,082 --> 01:47:40,515
They got horses in Australia.

1281
01:47:40,583 --> 01:47:44,019
They got thousands of miles
we could hide out in.

1282
01:47:44,087 --> 01:47:46,021
And a good climate,
nice beaches.

1283
01:47:46,089 --> 01:47:47,522
You could learn to swim.

1284
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:48,522
No!

1285
01:47:48,591 --> 01:47:50,149
Swimming
isn't important.

1286
01:47:52,962 --> 01:47:55,624
What about the banks?

1287
01:47:55,698 --> 01:47:57,358
They're easy.

1288
01:47:57,432 --> 01:47:59,093
Easy, ripe,
and luscious.

1289
01:48:03,071 --> 01:48:05,005
The banks
or the women?

1290
01:48:05,073 --> 01:48:08,008
Well, once you've got one,
you've got the other.

1291
01:48:10,712 --> 01:48:12,646
It's a long way,
isn't it?

1292
01:48:12,714 --> 01:48:15,148
Aw! Everything's
got to be perfect with you.

1293
01:48:15,217 --> 01:48:17,082
I don't want
to get there

1294
01:48:17,152 --> 01:48:18,585
and find out
it stinks.

1295
01:48:18,654 --> 01:48:19,985
At least
think about it.

1296
01:48:22,758 --> 01:48:23,952
All right.

1297
01:48:25,327 --> 01:48:26,760
I'll think about it.

1298
01:48:31,767 --> 01:48:32,699
Hey.

1299
01:48:34,736 --> 01:48:36,226
When we get outside...

1300
01:48:36,305 --> 01:48:38,739
and we get to the horses,

1301
01:48:38,807 --> 01:48:40,240
just remember one thing.

1302
01:48:44,313 --> 01:48:45,746
Hey, wait a minute.

1303
01:48:45,814 --> 01:48:47,441
What?

1304
01:48:47,516 --> 01:48:50,451
You didn't see LeFors
out there, did you?

1305
01:48:50,519 --> 01:48:51,577
LeFors?

1306
01:48:52,754 --> 01:48:54,688
No.

1307
01:48:54,756 --> 01:48:56,883
Oh, good.

1308
01:48:56,959 --> 01:48:58,392
For a moment there,

1309
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:00,894
I thought we were
in trouble.

1310
01:49:06,935 --> 01:49:07,765
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

1311
01:49:10,205 --> 01:49:11,229
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

1312
01:49:14,376 --> 01:49:15,570
<i>¡Fuego!</i>
