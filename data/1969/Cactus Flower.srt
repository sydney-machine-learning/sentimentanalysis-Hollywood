1
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:31,045
Hey in there, something wrong?

2
00:04:34,744 --> 00:04:36,284
Hey, I smell gas.

3
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,240
Julian.

4
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,874
- I'm not Julian. Wake up.
- Julian, kiss me.

5
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,555
Sorry, Julian, whoever you are.

6
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:11,510
Who are you? What are you doing?

7
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,595
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

8
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,917
- You were kissing me.
- I lost my head.

9
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,949
- How did you get in here?
- You left your gas on.

10
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
Gas?

11
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,510
I'm alive!

12
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,559
I blew it!

13
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,270
I blew it! Oh, boy, I really blew it!

14
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,027
Take it easy. Well, you're lucky I broke in.

15
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:37,866
- Why did you?
- I thought you were dying.

16
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:39,466
That was the whole idea.

17
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,907
Why don't you go back
and mind your own business...

18
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:44,427
...like everybody else in New York City?

19
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:45,873
Okay, lady.

20
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,424
That's the last time
you catch me saving your life.

21
00:06:49,524 --> 00:06:51,511
Damn it, you made me blow it!

22
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,507
Well, it happens
you were going about it all wrong.

23
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:58,266
You're supposed to put your head
in the stove.

24
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:01,830
It's a second-hand stove.
There were no directions.

25
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,104
- Why did you do it? Because of Julian?
- How do you know about Julian?

26
00:07:06,204 --> 00:07:08,185
You called me that
while you were kissing me.

27
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:11,229
I wasn't kissing you. You were kissing me.

28
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:15,313
- By the way, is that all you did?
- There wasn't much time.

29
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,548
I'm sorry. I guess I should be grateful.

30
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:23,676
- What's your name?
- Igor Sullivan.

31
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,628
- Igor Sullivan. That's wild.
- I made it up.

32
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:32,148
- How come you picked Igor?
- Igor's my own. I made up the Sullivan.

33
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:35,226
- It's a good name for a writer.
- You're a writer?

34
00:07:35,326 --> 00:07:36,384
You're the writer!

35
00:07:36,484 --> 00:07:39,109
The one who keeps pounding
on his typewriter all night?

36
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,706
You drive me crazy.

37
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:43,917
Why didn't you complain?
I could have met you earlier.

38
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,117
- You haven't told me your name.
- Toni Simmons.

39
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,869
- Look, Toni, what did this Julian do to you?
- Nothing.

40
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:54,589
He must have done something.
Did he cheat on you?

41
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:59,065
- Beat you? Is he a drunk? A crook?
- Worse.

42
00:07:59,165 --> 00:08:00,798
He's married.

43
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,634
For life.

44
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,952
He's got three kids.

45
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,424
I don't know why I'm telling you all this,
like you were Dear Abby.

46
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:12,788
- Is that that dirty rat Julian?
- He's not a dirty rat.

47
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:16,148
He's a dentist. A fine dentist, Fifth Avenue.

48
00:08:16,248 --> 00:08:17,986
With a wife and three kids.

49
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:21,029
That's one of the things
that attracted me to him.

50
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:24,954
- You go for married men?
- I like honesty.

51
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,026
All my life people have lied to me
and I can't stand it.

52
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:31,548
Julian at least had the decency to warn me
he had a wife and a family.

53
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:34,190
I was in love with him, so I accepted it.

54
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,795
At first I thought it was going to be
a gay, carefree fling.

55
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,190
Then came all those nights
when he couldn't make it.

56
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,274
And then he called tonight and cancelled.

57
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,827
- It was our anniversary.
- Anniversary? Of what?

58
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:58,109
We met one year ago at Stereo Heaven.
That's the record shop where I work.

59
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:00,634
I've been there. I never noticed you.

60
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,832
Well, Julian did. And I noticed him.

61
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,718
He was charming, good-looking,
sophisticated.

62
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,873
No sweatshirts.

63
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,317
Sorry, I didn't know this suicide
was black tie.

64
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,190
Sitting here alone tonight,
it suddenly came over me.

65
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,627
I have wasted away my whole life.

66
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:25,467
- Do you realize I'm 21?
- It's a lucky thing I smoke too much.

67
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:27,588
I was on my way to the corner
for cigarettes.

68
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:30,868
- The corner. Oh, my God!
- What's the matter?

69
00:09:30,968 --> 00:09:33,758
I wrote Julian telling him
what I was going to do.

70
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,864
What would be the sense of killing myself
if he didn't know about it?

71
00:09:37,964 --> 00:09:40,626
- Where are you going?
- I've got to get that letter back.

72
00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:41,994
Wait a minute!

73
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,345
- How do you plan to do that?
- With string and some chewing gum.

74
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:49,229
You already broke the law
when you attempted suicide.

75
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:52,437
Don't start monkeying around
with the federal government.

76
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,997
I guess you're right.

77
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,709
- What time is it?
- It's almost 3:00.

78
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:01,429
I've got to get up and go to work
in the morning.

79
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:03,795
Go away. I have to sleep.

80
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,189
- I'll take the day off.
- Yeah, why kill yourself?

81
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,826
Boy, you must be a pretty corny writer.
What sort of things do you write?

82
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:16,549
- Plays.
- What kind of plays?

83
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,306
Very advanced.
All the actors keep their clothes on.

84
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:21,268
Public's not quite ready for that.

85
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:24,426
- How do you live?
- I get an allowance from my father.

86
00:10:24,526 --> 00:10:28,064
Oh, boy!
I was beginning to feel sorry for you.

87
00:10:28,164 --> 00:10:29,832
Everybody can't be poor.

88
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,758
If you need anything,
just pound on the wall.

89
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,390
- I'll come right away.
- Thanks, Igor.

90
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,753
Good night.

91
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,760
Toni?

92
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,675
Igor, I want you to call Julian for me
in the morning, before he gets that letter.

93
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,786
- Why don't you call him yourself?
- In the first place, I'll be sleeping.

94
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,749
And second place,
I don't want to give him the satisfaction...

95
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:22,149
...of hearing me cry.

96
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:24,427
Why not throw a scare into him?
He deserves it.

97
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:27,389
He's liable to call the cops or something.
Will you do it?

98
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:28,435
Yes.

99
00:11:28,535 --> 00:11:31,546
He's in the book.
Julian Winston, D.D.S., Fifth Avenue.

100
00:11:31,646 --> 00:11:34,029
Julian Winston, D.D.S., Fifth Avenue.

101
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,264
What'll I say to him?

102
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:39,468
Tell him I'm alive
and I never want to see him again...

103
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:41,232
...as long as I live!

104
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,472
Dr. Winston's office. Who?

105
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,072
Igor Sullivan? Is it about an appointment?

106
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,948
I'm sorry, Mr. Sullivan,
but the doctor's with a patient right now.

107
00:12:04,048 --> 00:12:06,235
If you'll just give me the message.

108
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,834
If you insist on speaking to him,
then you'll have to call back later.

109
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,824
One lousy caramel,
and the whole damned filling come out.

110
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:19,993
Mrs. Durant, it was a temporary filling,
and you were warned to be careful.

111
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,467
Caramels!

112
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:23,625
Good heavens,
I've given up everything else.

113
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:26,147
- Is the doctor ready for me?
- He was 20 minutes ago.

114
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:29,630
But since you were late,
he gave your time to another patient.

115
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,158
- 'Morning, Miss Dickinson.
- Thank you, Howard.

116
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,347
Would you please tell the doctor
I'm in a hurry?

117
00:12:36,447 --> 00:12:39,426
- Charles is expecting me in half an hour.
- Charles?

118
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:42,825
Mr. Charles, the hairdresser.
Today he's taking care of me personally.

119
00:12:42,925 --> 00:12:44,745
I can't keep him waiting.

120
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:48,116
Really, Mrs. Durant, your teeth
are more important than your hair.

121
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,868
You really believe that, don't you?

122
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Sad.

123
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,834
Doctor Winston's office.
Good morning, Mrs. Andrews.

124
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,153
The doctor is booked solid today.
Let me check with him.

125
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,907
Doctor, Mrs. Andrews is on the phone.
Her bridge is wobbling.

126
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,905
Tell her to come at 8:00
tomorrow morning.

127
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:21,746
Yes, Doctor. And Mrs. Durant is here.

128
00:13:21,846 --> 00:13:24,027
When you get a minute,
I'd like to speak to you.

129
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:26,829
Mr. Greenfield,
please don't handle the instruments.

130
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:30,624
I was reading the other day
a dentist in New Jersey has topless nurses.

131
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:33,678
I didn't know
you were interested in reading.

132
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,064
She really turns me off.
I thought all Swedish dames were sexy.

133
00:13:39,164 --> 00:13:42,146
I've seen some of those movies,
but this one's like an iceberg.

134
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:45,987
- She's very efficient.
- Have you seen her out of her uniform?

135
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:49,789
I mean, in street clothes?
I'll bet she wears corrective hats.

136
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,078
What you don't like about Miss Dickinson
is exactly what I do like about her.

137
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,545
She's like a wife, a good wife:
Devoted, competent...

138
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:01,677
...takes care of everything for me
during the day.

139
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,868
At night, she goes home, to her home.

140
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,270
And I, with no problems and no cares,
go to my girl.

141
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,877
- My life is arranged the way I like it.
- Your girl?

142
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,029
- One girl? Singular?
- Didn't I tell you? It's been a year.

143
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:17,946
That's not the old Julian Winston I knew
in the old days.

144
00:14:18,046 --> 00:14:21,425
The Dancing Dentist
at the Copa every night with a new girl.

145
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:24,586
Toni has changed all that.
I don't want anyone else.

146
00:14:24,686 --> 00:14:28,145
- You mean you're in love with her?
- I tried to fight it.

147
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:32,067
Last night I deliberately broke a date
with Toni to go out with another girl.

148
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:36,597
Airline stewardess: Tall, built,
spectacular-looking Australian girl.

149
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,748
We went up to her place,
had a few drinks. Open.

150
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,037
- Bite. Stay that way.
- You can't leave me hanging like this.

151
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,187
- You wanted to see me about something?
- Yes, Doctor.

152
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:52,904
I've been meaning to speak to you
about Mr. Greenfield's bill.

153
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:57,146
- Miss Dickinson, he's an old friend.
- He's taking advantage of you.

154
00:14:57,246 --> 00:14:59,385
There are some things a man just can't do.

155
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:02,705
I won't push for money.
I've known him too long.

156
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:05,669
- You do it.
- Well, I'll be happy to.

157
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:08,107
- What's this?
- I ordered you some new shirts.

158
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,025
Yours are frayed around the collar.

159
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,424
You should change laundry.
They use too much starch.

160
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:15,027
- Stop mothering me.
- Here's a letter for you, Doctor.

161
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:17,350
When I'm through with Mr. Greenfield.

162
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,713
Rinse, please.

163
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,665
So, you went up to her place.
You had a few drinks...

164
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:44,788
Oh, yes. The stewardess. Beautiful girl.

165
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,387
- Then what happened?
- Nothing. Toni stopped me.

166
00:15:50,487 --> 00:15:52,226
- She showed up?
- In my mind.

167
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,508
Suddenly I saw her face before me
and I couldn't go through with it.

168
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:58,910
- I left, walked out.
- You wasted a whole stewardess?

169
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
Open.

170
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,949
- You going to get married?
- Married? Who said that?

171
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:11,069
- If you feel that way about your girl...
- I feel that way because she's my girl.

172
00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:13,747
You'd never catch me
feeling that way about a wife.

173
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,746
I've got a perfect setup.
Why spoil it by getting married?

174
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:19,107
That's a very healthy outlook.
What about her?

175
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:23,905
All girls want to get married.
I've been subdivided three times.

176
00:16:24,005 --> 00:16:27,470
Not Toni Simmons.
She thinks I'm already married.

177
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,035
You pulled that old stunt, huh?

178
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,305
The minute I met her, I knew
this girl could make me do anything.

179
00:16:33,405 --> 00:16:35,784
So just to protect myself in the clinches...

180
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:38,546
...I told her
that I had a wife and three children.

181
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:41,988
- Three children is a nice touch.
- I told it to her right away...

182
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:45,188
...so everything between us
is open and aboveboard.

183
00:16:45,288 --> 00:16:46,626
Very good.

184
00:16:46,726 --> 00:16:50,349
That's such a big, dirty, rotten, filthy lie,
it has class.

185
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,958
Now, I'm going to put this back.
It should hold you till next week.

186
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,998
All right, bite down hard.
That's it. Stay like that.

187
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,746
- Give Mr. Greenfield another appointment.
- Yes.

188
00:17:09,846 --> 00:17:12,586
I know you won't have time
to go out for lunch today...

189
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:15,985
...so I made you your favourite sandwiches:
Chicken and egg salad.

190
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:19,587
- You always liked them.
- If you say so.

191
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:23,347
Dr. Winston,
I'm so terribly sorry I was late.

192
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:28,468
It's all right, dear lady. That is all right.
But I understand we've been very naughty.

193
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,145
I don't know about you,
but I had one little caramel.

194
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:34,465
Besides being bad for your teeth,
Mrs. Durant...

195
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:37,836
...think of how caramels
can hurt those splendid hips.

196
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,791
Isn't he a marvellous dentist?

197
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,548
But with his talents he would have made
an even better obstetrician.

198
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:46,466
- In here, Mrs. Durant.
- See you next week.

199
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,429
I listened to you about your girl.
Let me tell you about mine.

200
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:52,309
She's a beautiful girl
with a figure like a Greek goddess.

201
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:55,987
- Great, big, beautiful eyes.
- Yeah, but her teeth need work.

202
00:17:56,087 --> 00:18:00,198
- Harvey, you pulled this on me before.
- Doctor, Mrs. Durant is ready.

203
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,191
But, Julian, old buddy.

204
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,707
All right, send her in
and I'll see what I can do.

205
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:07,951
But don't you know any girls
with straight teeth?

206
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,354
Excuse me, Sergeant... Miss Dickinson.

207
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,384
Dr. Winston asked me to make
an appointment for a lady friend of mine.

208
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:19,358
How about a week from Tuesday
at 7:00 a.m.?

209
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,826
- You're kidding. I'm asleep at 7:00 a.m.
- I thought this appointment was for a lady.

210
00:18:23,926 --> 00:18:26,878
That's right.
We're both asleep at 7:00 a.m.

211
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,673
- I hope I haven't shocked you.
- No, but it must be a terrible shock for her.

212
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,758
Will you get me
Mrs. Durant's chart, please?

213
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,429
By the way, Mr. Greenfield,
who's paying for this treatment?

214
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:41,158
Put it on my tab.

215
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,552
- There is no more room on your tab.
- Julian.

216
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,824
I feel insulted.
It isn't as if I'm planning to stick you.

217
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:52,111
It isn't as if
you're planning to pay me, either.

218
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,144
Things are slow for actors
this time of year.

219
00:18:59,244 --> 00:19:03,466
- But as soon as the new TV season starts...
- How about Thursday at 5:30 p.m.?

220
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:06,597
- Is that too early?
- We'll set the alarm.

221
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,747
- Will you prepare an anaesthetic syringe?
- Yes.

222
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:12,389
You said something about a letter?

223
00:19:12,489 --> 00:19:15,349
Yes, and your tailor called
about your fitting.

224
00:19:15,449 --> 00:19:17,707
That's something
I can't do for you any more...

225
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:20,908
...than I can go to the barber for you,
which you can also use.

226
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:22,666
- Oh, my God!
- What's wrong?

227
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:26,230
- Why didn't you show me this before?
- I tried to, but...

228
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,714
Doctor!

229
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,066
Are you leaving?

230
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,268
What about Mrs. Durant
and the other patients?

231
00:19:33,368 --> 00:19:35,910
- You handle it.
- Doctor, really!

232
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,666
If your girlfriends start to come
before your patients...

233
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:40,716
Miss Dickinson, shut up!

234
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,037
Dr. Winston's office.

235
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,072
No, he's not here.

236
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,267
Look, Mr. Sullivan, if it is that important,
you'd better tell me about it.

237
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:04,876
What? Toni is alive? Who is Toni? Hello?

238
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,153
I didn't know dentists made house calls.

239
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,636
I knew it.

240
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,627
- Knew what?
- That you wouldn't do it.

241
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:28,226
A whole day full of appointments...

242
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:31,226
...and you send a letter
that you're going to kill yourself...

243
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:34,066
...and then don't.
- Sorry to disappoint you.

244
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:37,827
- The whole thing was a fake, wasn't it?
- Everything between us is a fake.

245
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:40,224
Because I broke one lousy date last night?

246
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:42,507
It happens
that I had a very important meeting...

247
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:45,506
...with an Australian dentist.
We were comparing techniques.

248
00:20:45,606 --> 00:20:50,151
Don't try to spare my feelings, Julian.
I know you were out with your wife.

249
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,425
If you know, you know.

250
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:57,027
I've made up my mind, Julian.
We're through.

251
00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:59,467
What are you talking about?
We're so happy together.

252
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:01,428
- We are?
- I'm happy together.

253
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:05,905
I've decided to want a man of my own.
Exclusively. No more going halfsies.

254
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:08,709
I packed your pyjamas,
toothbrush and your picture.

255
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,518
Toni, this isn't like you.

256
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,547
Hi. I didn't know you had company.

257
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,625
It's only Julian. This is Igor Sullivan.

258
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:19,227
- I spoke to your nurse on the telephone.
- Something wrong with your teeth?

259
00:21:19,327 --> 00:21:21,145
I called to tell you that Toni's alive...

260
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:23,465
...and you didn't have to worry
about her letter.

261
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:25,944
- You feeling all right, Toni?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

262
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:29,388
I wanted to make sure you weren't playing
any more tricks with the gas.

263
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,544
- Gas?
- Gas.

264
00:21:30,644 --> 00:21:31,644
Gas.

265
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,157
- Toni, I'm a bastard, a no-good bastard.
- No, Julian.

266
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,988
- You really tried to kill yourself over me?
- Stupid, wasn't it?

267
00:21:41,088 --> 00:21:45,915
I'm a bastard,
the biggest bastard in the whole world.

268
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,790
Please, you're starting to make it sound
like bragging.

269
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,704
It wasn't your fault.
I knew what I was getting into.

270
00:21:53,804 --> 00:21:57,706
- You've always told the truth.
- I should've kept my mouth shut.

271
00:21:57,806 --> 00:22:01,395
You couldn't. You're a decent guy.
That's why I fell in love with you.

272
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,346
Now I'm returning you
to your wife and your children.

273
00:22:04,446 --> 00:22:06,351
I hope you'll be happy.

274
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,234
No, Toni.
Everything's going to be all right.

275
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,750
I'm going to make it up to you.

276
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,277
You'll take me away for another
fun-filled weekend at some motel.

277
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,513
No more weekends and no more motels.
Toni, I'm going to marry you.

278
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,144
How do you mean, marry?

279
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:29,109
You know, marry, with the judge,
the blood test, the license.

280
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:31,787
- But what about your wife?
- I'll divorce her.

281
00:22:31,887 --> 00:22:34,025
- The children?
- I'll divorce them, too.

282
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,866
- This isn't funny.
- I should have done it a long time ago.

283
00:22:36,966 --> 00:22:40,467
Baby, when I think you were ready to die
because of me...

284
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,994
Julian, you really do love me.

285
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,316
Did you ever doubt it?

286
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,628
- Julian, not now.
- Why not?

287
00:22:50,728 --> 00:22:53,429
Igor's next door. He can hear everything.

288
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:57,115
- Igor's been next door before.
- But I hadn't met him then.

289
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,030
Look, the sooner we move you out of here,
the better.

290
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,035
Now that you're going to be
Mrs. Julian Winston.

291
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,758
Imagine that. Me, a married man.

292
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,668
- I mean, me, married to you.
- Julian, what's going to become of her?

293
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:19,912
- Your wife?
- Why do we keep talking about my wife?

294
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,189
You're going to have
to make some arrangements about her.

295
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:25,744
- What do you figure on doing?
- Simple. Hup, out!

296
00:23:25,844 --> 00:23:28,027
Is that what you'll say
when you get tired of me?

297
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:32,398
- "Hup, out"?
- No, this is different, darling.

298
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,384
I love you. My wife and I...
I never even knew her.

299
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:39,358
How did the three children come?
United Parcel?

300
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,275
Well, at the beginning I was polite.

301
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,668
Will you stop worrying about my wife?
She'll be taken care of.

302
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,314
- What if she refuses to give you a divorce?
- She wouldn't dare. Let's forget her.

303
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,829
I can't.

304
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:58,595
The thought of being a housebreaker
sort of spoils things!

305
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,237
A home-breaker.
A housebreaker is a crook.

306
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,238
I'm stealing you away from your wife.

307
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,386
You may not believe it,
but I have certain standards.

308
00:24:08,486 --> 00:24:10,864
Toni, I haven't wanted to go into this...

309
00:24:10,964 --> 00:24:15,425
...but what if I told you
that it's my wife who wants the divorce?

310
00:24:15,525 --> 00:24:17,829
You mean she found out about us?

311
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,351
Let's just say she wants her freedom, too.

312
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,279
In that case, I'll be proud to marry you.

313
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,945
- What the hell are you doing there?
- Fixing Toni's window.

314
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:45,191
If she waits for the janitor,
it'll take forever.

315
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,913
Thanks, Igor.

316
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,027
Tell him to get the hell out
and come back later.

317
00:24:51,127 --> 00:24:53,156
Julian, don't be so impatient.

318
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,667
Now that we're engaged...

319
00:24:56,767 --> 00:24:59,911
...don't you think
we should do something to celebrate?

320
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,394
I know.

321
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,386
Let's do something
we've never done before.

322
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:06,550
You can take me out in the daytime.

323
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,757
Did you get enough sauerkraut?

324
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,669
- I want to meet her.
- Who?

325
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:26,229
- Your wife.
- My wife?

326
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:28,465
I want to get things straightened out
with her.

327
00:25:28,565 --> 00:25:30,625
Come on. That really isn't necessary.

328
00:25:30,725 --> 00:25:33,270
I want her to tell me herself
she wants to leave you.

329
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,874
She does. Have I ever lied to you?

330
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,464
- You'll arrange it, won't you, Julian?
- What?

331
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:41,269
For me to meet your wife.

332
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:44,665
It's important she doesn't think of me
as some sort of house-wrecker.

333
00:25:44,765 --> 00:25:48,673
- Home-wrecker.
- I don't want to hide if I run into her.

334
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,679
Believe me, you'll never run into her.

335
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,318
Julian, if I don't meet your wife,
I won't be happy.

336
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,673
If I'm not happy, then you won't be happy.

337
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,664
I'll bet he cheated and used a ruler.

338
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:09,639
- When am I going to meet her?
- You can take my word for it.

339
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,669
- You've got to promise.
- I'll do nothing of the kind.

340
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,424
- Now let's just drop the whole thing.
- All right, let's drop it.

341
00:26:17,524 --> 00:26:19,388
Do you know what this represents?

342
00:26:19,488 --> 00:26:22,226
- Goodbye, Julian.
- "Goodbye"?

343
00:26:22,326 --> 00:26:23,629
It's was very nice knowing you.

344
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:27,235
Just a minute. Toni, come back here.
Wait a minute. Toni!

345
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,748
You'll meet her.

346
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:32,115
You'll meet her!

347
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,545
- Oh, <i>Señor</i> Sanchez...
- The doctor, he is waiting?

348
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,865
I tried to call you at the UN,
but you had left.

349
00:26:47,965 --> 00:26:50,307
The doctor had to cancel
his appointments today.

350
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:53,066
- That's too bad.
- But as long as you're here...

351
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:55,826
...we might as well x-ray that tooth
that's bothering you.

352
00:26:55,926 --> 00:26:57,114
I don't mind.

353
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,947
But you're not afraid of Dr. Winston,
are you?

354
00:27:02,047 --> 00:27:04,547
It's funny, by nature I am not a coward.

355
00:27:04,647 --> 00:27:07,626
In fact,
I'm known in my own country as <i>El Bravo.</i>

356
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,870
<i>El Bravo.</i> How about that?

357
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,308
I have been through six bloody revolutions.
At United Nations, I've sat in my seat...

358
00:27:17,408 --> 00:27:20,508
...I've listened to a nine-hour speech
by the Bulgarian delegate.

359
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:22,670
Yet, when it comes to dentists...

360
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,758
Well, we all have our little weaknesses.

361
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,747
- I have several big ones.
- Now, <i>Señor</i> Sanchez.

362
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,346
I cannot help myself.

363
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:33,149
There is something so provocative
about a nurse in uniform.

364
00:27:33,249 --> 00:27:36,550
No frills, no adornments,
just the basic woman.

365
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,754
Now, you hold that with your finger.

366
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,227
There we are.

367
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:46,438
Hold still, <i>Señor,</i> or the basic woman
is liable to x-ray your nose.

368
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,509
Hold still.

369
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,029
There.

370
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,039
Thank you.

371
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,235
There we are.

372
00:27:57,335 --> 00:28:02,669
Miss Dickinson, you're an attractive
woman, yet you try to conceal it.

373
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:04,186
Very successfully, I'd say.

374
00:28:04,286 --> 00:28:06,345
But we Latins have an eye
for hidden beauty.

375
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:10,948
For centuries, our women were covered up
with mantillas, long dresses, veils.

376
00:28:11,048 --> 00:28:13,829
In self-defence,
we have had to develop an instinct...

377
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:17,833
...for guessing what was underneath.
- I'll give you another appointment.

378
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,269
You're very charming, my dear,
and so easy to talk to.

379
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:26,224
- You are a woman worth knowing.
- What about next Friday at 5:00?

380
00:28:26,324 --> 00:28:29,987
- Wonderful! Where shall we meet?
- This is for you and Dr. Winston.

381
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:33,704
I would like for us to have one night,
candlelight, soft guitars...

382
00:28:33,804 --> 00:28:37,504
- Will you bring along your wife?
- You would not like her. Nobody likes her.

383
00:28:37,604 --> 00:28:39,984
Let's make it for next Friday,
after my appointment.

384
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:42,753
<i>Señor</i> Sanchez, I can't.
You're a married man.

385
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,866
I cannot understand.
If I'm a married man, it is my problem.

386
00:28:45,966 --> 00:28:47,386
What has it got to do with you?

387
00:28:47,486 --> 00:28:50,226
I would not be prejudiced
if you were married.

388
00:28:50,326 --> 00:28:53,465
<i>Señor</i> Sanchez, how are you?
Come. I can take you now.

389
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,232
I cannot take you now.

390
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,079
Miss Dickinson,
I'm sorry I ran out on you this morning.

391
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,625
- I managed.
- I knew you would.

392
00:29:03,725 --> 00:29:05,748
You knew I would.
I didn't know I would.

393
00:29:05,848 --> 00:29:08,586
But I did. Rearranged your appointments.

394
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:11,708
Said you had to go to your dentist.
That made them happy.

395
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,950
I can always count on you in a jam.

396
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,876
If you don't need me anymore, Doctor,
I'm going home.

397
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,552
I'll get that.

398
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,829
Hello?

399
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,634
Don't worry. You'll meet her.

400
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,549
- Miss Dickinson.
- Yes, Doctor?

401
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,746
Are you in a hurry this evening?

402
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:46,230
Why, no, Doctor,
if there's anything I can do for you.

403
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,870
I thought maybe you'd like to come out
and have a drink with me.

404
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,870
Are you asking me to go out?

405
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,398
Why? Is there somebody else
in that closet?

406
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,118
I don't understand.

407
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,027
It's the most natural thing in the world
for a doctor to take his nurse out.

408
00:30:12,127 --> 00:30:16,511
After ten years, this is the first time
that you have ever invited me.

409
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,069
Better a little late than a little never.

410
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,954
And I suddenly realized
that I have no idea...

411
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,033
...of what your life is like outside the office.

412
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,633
Tell me about Stephanie Dickinson, civilian.

413
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,396
- I don't know where to begin.
- That's a good place.

414
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,704
- I live in Jackson Heights.
- That much I know.

415
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:51,908
- Alone?
- Yes.

416
00:30:52,008 --> 00:30:55,949
No, I live with my sister Anna
and her husband and their two boys...

417
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:58,265
...and a bulldog named Max.

418
00:30:58,365 --> 00:31:01,636
- Sounds cosy.
- Yes. I like large families.

419
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,108
I help Anna with the cooking.

420
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:10,672
After dinner I walk the dog, or I read,
watch TV, if there's a good documentary.

421
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,825
- And sometimes we play Monopoly.
- Monopoly. That's fun.

422
00:31:14,925 --> 00:31:18,151
And my brother-in-law is very good at it,
but he cheats.

423
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,664
Then on Saturdays
I take my two nephews to town.

424
00:31:21,764 --> 00:31:23,955
We go to the zoo or the park.

425
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,465
What do you do on your vacation?

426
00:31:27,565 --> 00:31:31,067
That's when I become a different person:
Independent, adventurous.

427
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:34,385
- I saddle up my little Volvo...
- That's a good car.

428
00:31:34,485 --> 00:31:38,908
It's second-hand.
I break away and tool up to Cape Cod.

429
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,833
- Alone?
- Yes. Just me, my paintbox and Max.

430
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,155
- Max?
- The dog.

431
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,504
For the two weeks, I wear blue jeans
and walk around barefoot...

432
00:31:48,604 --> 00:31:50,397
...and paint up a storm.

433
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,439
What about your personal life? I mean...

434
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,914
- You mean men?
- Yes.

435
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,915
- At the moment, there are no men.
- But there have been?

436
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,796
Doctor, I'm no sex goddess,
but I haven't spent my life in a tree.

437
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,308
I was married when I was very young,
but it didn't work out.

438
00:32:11,408 --> 00:32:14,995
- Married? I had no idea.
- Neither did he.

439
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,909
And once I was very much in love.
It lasted for a long time, but...

440
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:23,037
- But?
- He couldn't leave his wife.

441
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,627
- Him, too.
- What do you mean, "him, too"?

442
00:32:27,727 --> 00:32:30,837
Nothing. I was thinking of a similar case.

443
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,550
In this job,
you don't meet anything but married men.

444
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,112
I suppose all the single ones
have good teeth.

445
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,227
Frankly, I hadn't planned on being
an old maid.

446
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:45,386
An old maid? Nonsense.
You've got a long way to go.

447
00:32:45,486 --> 00:32:49,268
I've been talking an awful lot
and I'm afraid I'll be late for dinner.

448
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,239
Miss Dickinson.

449
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,589
I'm glad we had this little talk.

450
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,917
You're a very rare person:
Sensitive and generous.

451
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,710
Yes, I guess I'm all right.

452
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,428
I have a feeling that if I found myself
in trouble, I could count on you for help.

453
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,425
You know that's true, Doctor.

454
00:33:10,525 --> 00:33:14,027
But sometimes a problem comes up
that's so difficult that...

455
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:15,917
Why don't you try me?

456
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,713
Miss Dickinson,
you could do me a great service.

457
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,673
You see I'm desperately in need of a wife.

458
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,869
- Please, don't misunderstand me.
- I never expected...

459
00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:37,793
I need a wife temporarily,
fifteen or twenty minutes.

460
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,185
Fifteen or twenty minutes?

461
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,236
I'm telling all of this very badly.

462
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,870
I want someone
to play the part of my wife.

463
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,508
- Someone like me.
- If only you would.

464
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:52,034
It wouldn't involve any...

465
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,067
All you'd have to do is tell a certain person
that you want a divorce.

466
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,225
You see,
I've suddenly decided to get married.

467
00:33:58,325 --> 00:34:00,949
- I guess I didn't tell you.
- No, you didn't tell me.

468
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:03,669
Well, I have. Her name is Toni Simmons.

469
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:07,188
I'm supposed to give you a message.
She's alive.

470
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:08,909
That's only part of it.

471
00:34:09,009 --> 00:34:11,230
My problem is
she thinks I'm already married.

472
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,232
Where did she get such an idea?

473
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,193
I had my reasons.

474
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,110
But I'll straighten that out later.
I have to dig up a wife.

475
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,513
Stop digging and tell the girl the truth.
Good night.

476
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,473
I can't tell her anything now.
She's liable to...

477
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,715
Well, she's so young and she's had
a lot of unfortunate experiences.

478
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,430
I'm the first decent man she's ever met.

479
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,793
Are you quoting her, or you?

480
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,269
Toni is a wonderful girl.

481
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:40,585
She won't get married
unless she meets my wife.

482
00:34:40,685 --> 00:34:43,389
She's straightforward,
doesn't want to be a housebreaker.

483
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:45,625
I mean, a house-wrecker. Isn't that sweet?

484
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:48,466
- Just darling.
- She works at Stereo Heaven in the Village.

485
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:52,067
- If you would just go and meet her...
- I'm sorry. I hate lies.

486
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:55,596
No more than I do, Miss Dickinson,
no more than I.

487
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,953
But to get out of this one,
my happiness lies in your two hands.

488
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,789
For years these hands have held nothing
but your instruments...

489
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:05,552
...and your appointment book.

490
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,637
You've managed to handle your happiness
without any help from me.

491
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,870
And now you want to use me
in this contemptible way.

492
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,747
You tricked me into talking about myself
so that...

493
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:20,752
What you did wasn't very nice, Doctor.
Not very nice at all.

494
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,909
You just can't get decent help these days.

495
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,638
I thought you were taking us
to the zoo today.

496
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,911
This is better than the zoo.
Here, go and buy yourselves an ice cream.

497
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,113
I'll be over there in the record shop.
I'll meet you here.

498
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,840
Good.

499
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,314
- Don't you have this in mono?
- It's been discontinued.

500
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,159
Let me look in the stockroom.
Maybe we still have a copy.

501
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,635
Can I help you?

502
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,110
No thanks. Just browsing.

503
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,068
- When will you get the Horowitz concert?
- It should be in later this week.

504
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,278
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

505
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,797
Looking for something in particular?

506
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,267
That Horowitz album, if I order it now,
will you mail it to me?

507
00:36:56,367 --> 00:37:00,478
- Certainly. May I have your name, please?
- Mrs. Julian Winston.

508
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,832
Do you have an account with us?

509
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,510
No, but my husband
does a lot of business here.

510
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,507
- Surely you remember my husband.
- I may have assisted him sometime.

511
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:12,158
I wouldn't be surprised.

512
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,349
- Pardon?
- Maybe you didn't catch my name.

513
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:17,192
Mrs. Julian Winston.

514
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,989
Marcia.

515
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,308
Would you handle this? My customer?
I'll take care of this.

516
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,408
Sure.

517
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,429
Mrs. Winston, I'm Toni Simmons.
I suppose you came here to see me.

518
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,755
Dr. Winston, my husband, said that
you were most anxious to meet me.

519
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,869
Well, here I am.

520
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,233
Did he tell you about our plans?

521
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,553
- The divorce. Naturally.
- Well?

522
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,031
- Well, what?
- You don't mind?

523
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,273
The doctor and I are in agreement
about the divorce.

524
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,114
I can't tell you
how good that makes me feel.

525
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,435
- I made your day?
- You see, Mrs. Winston...

526
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,907
Call me Stephanie.

527
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:12,673
After all,
I won't be Mrs. Winston much longer.

528
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,400
- Then you do mind?
- Of course not.

529
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,792
Things between the doctor and me
have become impossible.

530
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,874
I can't tell you
how good that makes me feel.

531
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,915
I'm glad.

532
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,673
May I ask you a question?

533
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,829
Are you absolutely sure
that you love Julian?

534
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,156
- Do I love him?
- Do you?

535
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,516
Madly. Wildly. Desperately.

536
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,545
As long as you're fond of him.
I don't want him to end up unhappy.

537
00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:47,758
I understand, especially after he had
such a terrible marriage.

538
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,509
It was not so terrible.
Our marriage lasted ten years and we...

539
00:38:52,609 --> 00:38:54,397
I notice you're not wearing a ring.

540
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,230
Well, when something is over, it's over.

541
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,546
I just hope that you have better luck
with Julian than I did.

542
00:39:00,646 --> 00:39:04,147
I'm sure I will.
There's one thing that's bothering me...

543
00:39:04,247 --> 00:39:07,357
I'll be happy to play this for you,
if you'll just come...

544
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,955
- Who's going to tell the children?
- The children?

545
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,671
It's going to be tough explaining
a horrible thing to three young children.

546
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,673
Three. We have to tell them.

547
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,515
Three.

548
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,312
Well, I'll tell them.
Julian is no good at that sort of thing.

549
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,358
- How will they take it?
- They'll get used to it.

550
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,665
Now I'll be able to devote myself to them
full-time.

551
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,035
I've been busy helping Julian
with his work.

552
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,104
- Of course, he does have a nurse.
- Yes. I hear Miss Dickinson is marvellous.

553
00:39:59,204 --> 00:40:00,157
She is.

554
00:40:00,257 --> 00:40:03,749
One of those sterling old maids,
probably madly in love with the boss.

555
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,192
- Did Julian tell you that?
- No, not exactly.

556
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,269
But one night when he worked late,
I suddenly got jealous of Miss Dickinson.

557
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,558
When I told him about it,
he just laughed and laughed.

558
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,554
- Have you ever been jealous of her?
- Not me.

559
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,151
A woman who marries Julian
must not be the possessive type.

560
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,589
I know Julian must have played around.

561
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,554
After all,
when a man has a terrible marriage...

562
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,396
Don't keep saying that. I must go, really.

563
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,878
Mrs. Winston, you asked me a question,
and now I want to ask you one.

564
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,914
Are you sure you don't love him anymore?

565
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,797
Of course I don't love him anymore.

566
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,749
But you can't leave a man after so many
years without feeling a little pain.

567
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,117
A man with whom you have shared normal,
everyday things.

568
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,866
Worrying about his barber,
making sandwiches for him.

569
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:57,349
He loves
chicken and egg salad sandwiches.

570
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,157
And buying his shirts, his pyjamas,
his handkerchiefs, looking after him.

571
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,714
Planning for him, a man who's all yours.

572
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,236
At least, almost all yours.
I don't know what has come over me.

573
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,790
I'm talking nonsense.
It must be that music.

574
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,947
You will see that I get
that Horowitz album?

575
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:24,786
Of course. Shall I charge it to Dr. Winston?

576
00:41:24,886 --> 00:41:27,155
I'd better get used to paying
for things myself.

577
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,237
- You want it sent to your home?
- Yes.

578
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:36,550
No. Send it to 975 Glenwood,
Jackson Heights, Apartment 3A.

579
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,987
You moved out?

580
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:41,311
I packed everything, children included,
and moved in with my sister.

581
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,949
I thought that was the best thing
for everybody.

582
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,674
Mrs. Winston!

583
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,790
What about your future?
What's going to become of you?

584
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,677
I'll ride into the sunset.

585
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,555
Well, I want to be sure you're all right.

586
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,071
Well, I'll write you every day.

587
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,949
Mrs. Winston!

588
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,465
I want you to know I think
you're a very gracious, charming...

589
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:04,993
...and very brave woman.

590
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,113
Thank you, my dear.

591
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,513
- I thought it was Toni.
- What if it had been?

592
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,670
I want to get my electric razor
from her apartment.

593
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,113
Why would it be in there?

594
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,080
Because you can't slash wrists
with an electric razor.

595
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,599
I took her blades.

596
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,997
- Butt out of my fiancée's life.
- Fiancée.

597
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,228
Look, dentist, stop stringing the girl along.
You're not going to leave your wife.

598
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,837
For your information, sir,
Toni and I are getting married.

599
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,308
- She didn't tell me.
- Why should she?

600
00:43:09,408 --> 00:43:12,233
Hey, Igor. That's a new towel.

601
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,995
Hello, Julian.

602
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,838
I just heard the good news.
Congratulations.

603
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,554
Thanks, Igor. It'll take a while yet.

604
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,665
- First there's the divorce.
- We haven't gotten our divorce yet?

605
00:43:24,765 --> 00:43:27,267
Would you give Tarzan here
his electric razor?

606
00:43:27,367 --> 00:43:29,707
I'm sorry, Igor. I should have returned it.

607
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,546
So, you haven't gotten the divorce yet?

608
00:43:31,646 --> 00:43:34,234
I'd like to have you in my chair
for five minutes.

609
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,224
- Thanks.
- Next time, don't come in that outfit.

610
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,470
You want me to get all dressed up
to shave?

611
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
How come you're so late?

612
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,032
Julian, I had a visitor at the shop
this afternoon. Your wife.

613
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,304
- She came?
- She was magnificent.

614
00:43:50,404 --> 00:43:52,755
Handled herself beautifully.
She's a real lady.

615
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,670
Well, I don't marry just anybody.

616
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,032
- Then everything is all cleared up?
- Julian, you lied to me.

617
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,355
Never! What did she tell you? I deny it.

618
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,996
You may not be aware of it yourself,
but your wife still loves you.

619
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,550
I'm telling you, your wife still loves you.

620
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,431
Did she not tell you
that she agrees to a divorce?

621
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,912
She's only doing it to make you happy.
She's crazy about you.

622
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,999
Stay calm. Tell me what the damn fool...
What my wife said.

623
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,839
Well, it's not what she said,
it's what she didn't say.

624
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,270
Tell me what she didn't say.
Word for word.

625
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,430
It was the way she talked about you,
your barber, your shirts, handkerchiefs.

626
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,079
I got all choked up.

627
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,271
And she mentioned
those chicken and egg salad sandwiches.

628
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,793
You mean to say that
she bragged about her damn sandwiches?

629
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,839
She didn't brag. She just told me.
It sounded as if they were made with love.

630
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,787
They were made
with too much mayonnaise.

631
00:44:47,887 --> 00:44:51,589
Next time I'm going to smack her
right across the mouth with it.

632
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,067
There's a cruel streak in you.
This fine woman who...

633
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:58,038
"This fine woman"?
Suddenly you're my wife's lawyer.

634
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,593
- You wanted to see her. I fixed it.
- That was a mistake.

635
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,238
Maybe if I never met her...
But I did and I liked her.

636
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,638
- Especially when I saw her with the kids.
- The kids?

637
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,074
She brought the kids?

638
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,547
They were waiting for her
across the street.

639
00:45:14,647 --> 00:45:16,710
Not the little girl, just the two boys.

640
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,588
- Must be those damn nephews.
- Incidentally, how old is Peter?

641
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,280
Peter?

642
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,351
That's your older boy, isn't it?

643
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,480
Yeah.

644
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,070
Yes, that's Peter all right.

645
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,233
- Let's see, how old would he be now?
- You told me he was 8.

646
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,557
- Well, if that's what I told you.
- Well, he looked more like 12 to me.

647
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,229
Yes, well...
No, it's the younger boy who's 8.

648
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,272
Peter is 12.

649
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,634
That's very interesting, considering
you've only been married 10 years.

650
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,272
Come on, Julian, the truth.

651
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,788
Well, all right.

652
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,952
The truth is, Peter was a premature baby.
He was born before we were married.

653
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,755
I'm glad. That confirms everything.

654
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,520
How's that?

655
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,985
Here's a woman who gave herself
to you before you were married.

656
00:46:16,085 --> 00:46:17,798
That proves it was true love.

657
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,998
For God's sake, Toni.

658
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,310
I'd feel guilty if I did anything to...

659
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:26,832
Toni, I told you that she wants the divorce
as much as I do.

660
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,033
And for a very good reason.

661
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,033
What good reason?

662
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,714
What good reason?

663
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,513
Oh, boy!

664
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,269
Another guy.

665
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,235
Your wife? Another man?
I'd be very much surprised.

666
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,830
A man with a normal ego
wouldn't lie about that.

667
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,473
Maybe you're right.

668
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,989
The fact that you've been cheated on
makes it all seem nicer somehow.

669
00:46:54,089 --> 00:46:57,029
- As long as you're happy.
- Why shouldn't she have a boyfriend?

670
00:46:57,129 --> 00:46:59,236
- You have a mistress.
- You nut.

671
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,787
Julian, if we're going to dinner
and a movie...

672
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,269
Why don't we stay in
and scramble something?

673
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,990
- I don't think we ought to do this anymore.
- What?

674
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,906
You're getting a divorce.
We ought to be more careful.

675
00:47:10,006 --> 00:47:12,464
- We don't want this to get messy.
- No. But, baby...

676
00:47:12,564 --> 00:47:14,944
It's only for six weeks
while she goes to Reno.

677
00:47:15,044 --> 00:47:18,265
Reno? Hell, I'm going to send her
to Mexico for a quickie divorce.

678
00:47:18,365 --> 00:47:19,873
In, out, finished, bingo.

679
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,918
Do you think he'll marry her?

680
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,389
- Who?
- Your wife's boyfriend.

681
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,478
- I don't know. Maybe. Who cares?
- I'm curious.

682
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,872
- What's he like? What does he do?
- I have no idea. I don't know him.

683
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,430
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Look him over?

684
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,638
Toni, you're getting that look. Two, please.

685
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,228
But, Julian, this man
may become your children's stepfather.

686
00:47:46,328 --> 00:47:50,349
He may rob your wife, exploit or beat her.
You have to arrange for us to meet him.

687
00:47:50,449 --> 00:47:51,449
No.

688
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,069
I'll do it myself.
Now that I know her, I'll just call her.

689
00:47:59,169 --> 00:48:00,639
No, you mustn't!

690
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,106
You won't do this one little thing for me?

691
00:48:05,206 --> 00:48:06,206
No!

692
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,960
No!

693
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,629
But it's such a little thing.
All we do is find a man...

694
00:48:11,729 --> 00:48:12,729
No!

695
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,312
And, if you'll excuse me,
I have to develop some x-rays.

696
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,025
I threw this boyfriend thing at you
too quickly.

697
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:22,192
- I'll get rid of Mrs. Durant and then...
- It won't do any good.

698
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,113
Boy, you're getting
as prickly as your damn cactus.

699
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,830
- What's going on between you two?
- Nothing in particular.

700
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,632
Don't try to fool me, Doc.
I have a very good nose for sexual tension.

701
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,949
That's very funny, Mrs. Durant.
Very funny.

702
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,080
Open.

703
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,106
- You'll ruin the x-rays.
- Now, listen, Miss Dickinson...

704
00:49:00,206 --> 00:49:04,905
You listen to me. I posed as your wife.
I did it. I think I did it beautifully.

705
00:49:05,005 --> 00:49:07,746
Too beautifully.
Toni thinks you're still in love with me.

706
00:49:07,846 --> 00:49:09,558
- Me?
- Not you, my wife.

707
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,234
- How could she get an idea like that?
- From you.

708
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,027
Nonsense. I acted like a dignified,
civilized, willing-to-be-divorced wife.

709
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:19,425
I couldn't take my situation lightly
because of the children.

710
00:49:19,525 --> 00:49:21,947
Why did you bring them?
That's what choked her up.

711
00:49:22,047 --> 00:49:23,988
I always take my nephews out
on Saturdays.

712
00:49:24,088 --> 00:49:28,386
If I can't spend my weekends as I see fit,
me and my cactus will be glad to resign.

713
00:49:28,486 --> 00:49:31,508
- You know I can't get along without you.
- Of course I do.

714
00:49:31,608 --> 00:49:34,990
Help me not as a friend, but as a nurse.
It's your professional duty.

715
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,629
Yes. My problems with Toni
are beginning to affect my work.

716
00:49:38,729 --> 00:49:43,744
Just now I hurt Mrs. Durant. She felt pain.
It's the first time I've ever hurt a patient.

717
00:49:43,844 --> 00:49:45,910
Too bad it wasn't Harvey Greenfield.

718
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,633
You played that part of my wife once
and you enjoyed yourself. Admit it.

719
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,865
- Yes. It wasn't too bad.
- All right.

720
00:49:52,965 --> 00:49:55,185
Here's your chance to play
a return engagement.

721
00:49:55,285 --> 00:49:57,475
No actress quits after one performance.

722
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,704
So, I lose a husband and gain a lover?
At least I don't feel abandoned.

723
00:50:01,804 --> 00:50:05,475
Good. We have to find someone
to play the part of your boyfriend.

724
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,157
What about <i>Señor</i> Sanchez?
He keeps sniffing around me.

725
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,874
Your brother-in-law,
the dirty Monopoly player?

726
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,637
Doctor, you want me
to furnish my own props?

727
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,440
- You find me one.
- That won't be easy.

728
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,520
I mean, we have to find someone
I know I can trust.

729
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,675
Am I late?

730
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,916
- Actually, Harvey, you're just in time.
- Not him!

731
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,992
What's going on here?
Boy, does she hate me.

732
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,433
You're wrong about that.

733
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,555
Harvey, would you like
to have your girl's teeth fixed for free?

734
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,599
- I thought you'd never show up.
- You mean, you hoped.

735
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,997
Right this way, Mr. Greenfield.

736
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,829
- Why did you choose this place?
- It's the new in spot.

737
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:28,798
- I never heard of it.
- Nobody has. That's why it's popular.

738
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,790
Well, what'll you have to drink?

739
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,198
- Let's go all out and have champagne.
- Very good, Madame.

740
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,640
Domestic.

741
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,315
- Where are they?
- They'll be here.

742
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,987
You know, you look different
when you're dressed up.

743
00:51:45,087 --> 00:51:47,833
In the office, you look like a large Band-Aid.

744
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,795
I couldn't care less what you think of me.

745
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,595
I'm your lover, remember?
That's the reason you're getting a divorce.

746
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,997
So, let's act a little crazy about me,
shall we?

747
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,505
Your hand.

748
00:51:59,605 --> 00:52:01,357
- What about it?
- It's on my knee.

749
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,272
Sorry, I thought it was mine.

750
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,355
- Shall we dance?
- I'd rather walk on hot coals.

751
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,836
This is going to be a smashing evening.

752
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,716
I didn't know
they made champagne in Idaho.

753
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,509
- Drink. It'll make me look better to you.
- There isn't that much wine in the world.

754
00:52:28,609 --> 00:52:30,670
- To our love affair.
- God forbid.

755
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,120
There they are.

756
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,864
- Quick.
- Quick what?

757
00:52:37,964 --> 00:52:40,344
And act natural, romantic. Flirt with me.

758
00:52:40,444 --> 00:52:43,477
You want me to act natural
and flirt with you at the same time?

759
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,072
You really are a louse.

760
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,598
A scotch and water
and a scotch and soda, please.

761
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,119
- Julian, don't look now, but it's your wife.
- My wife? Nonsense.

762
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,269
No, I'm sure that's her over there
with that man.

763
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,953
That's my wife, all right.
And with her boyfriend.

764
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,994
- What do you know about that?
- This is embarrassing.

765
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,632
- Well, you insisted on seeing him.
- But now I feel like a spy. Let's go.

766
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,631
Well, as long as we're here,
how do you know that's her boyfriend?

767
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,390
Well, who else could it be?
Besides, look at them.

768
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,550
They act very affectionate.

769
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,793
Yes, they do.

770
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,236
I thought she only played Monopoly.

771
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,238
Go easy on that stuff.
I'm not sure I can pay for it.

772
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,188
Don't worry.
Dr. Winston gave me money for the check.

773
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,155
Thank you.

774
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,152
I don't think they've noticed us.
We'd better push it. Let's dance.

775
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,436
- But when I asked...
- Shut up and dance.

776
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,799
She dances, too.

777
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,840
Everything about your wife
seems to surprise you.

778
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,880
It's been so long
since we've really communicated.

779
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,276
Come on, I want to look at them closer.

780
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,345
- Your hand!
- I'm only human.

781
00:54:37,445 --> 00:54:38,475
Barely.

782
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,666
- Oh, sorry.
- Hello, Julian.

783
00:54:40,766 --> 00:54:43,320
- Talk about coincidence.
- Good evening.

784
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,306
- I want you to meet my...
- Hi, honey.

785
00:54:45,406 --> 00:54:47,305
I'm Harvey Greenfield, the boyfriend.

786
00:54:47,405 --> 00:54:50,029
- Harvey, this is my husband.
- Good to meet you, old man.

787
00:54:50,129 --> 00:54:52,504
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Join us for a drink?

788
00:54:52,604 --> 00:54:53,744
No. Well, I...

789
00:54:53,844 --> 00:54:57,667
We are civilized people,
unless you two prefer to be alone.

790
00:54:57,767 --> 00:55:00,788
Hell, no! I mean, we are civilized people.

791
00:55:00,888 --> 00:55:04,031
Look, why don't you come to our table?
This party's on me.

792
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,349
- What do you think of him?
- Ask me later.

793
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,027
It's strange to see you in a nightclub.
I didn't know you were such a swinger.

794
00:55:15,127 --> 00:55:19,026
- You never really knew me, my dear.
- Can we have some more glasses, please?

795
00:55:19,126 --> 00:55:20,829
Julian thinks of me as a homebody...

796
00:55:20,929 --> 00:55:23,586
...because of all the years
I was trapped by the children.

797
00:55:23,686 --> 00:55:25,033
Of course.

798
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,715
By the way, Mr. Greenfield,
how do you like children?

799
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,679
Barbecued.

800
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,830
That's the kind of joke made by a man
who is trying to hide his feelings.

801
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,789
- Deep down, I know you love children.
- Deep down.

802
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:45,999
Deep down. Yes, especially yours.
I'm nuts about them.

803
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,351
Mr. Greenfield,
what kind of work do you do?

804
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,837
- I don't work, honey, I'm an actor.
- Pour the wine.

805
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,717
An actor?
Isn't that a very insecure profession?

806
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,479
Only financially.

807
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,435
That's quite a girl you've got there, Julian.

808
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,266
I hear it's going to happen soon
between you two.

809
00:56:04,366 --> 00:56:05,504
As soon as we can.

810
00:56:05,604 --> 00:56:08,309
- I hardly think it's the moment to...
- Come on, Toni.

811
00:56:08,409 --> 00:56:10,516
We have nothing to hide
from these people.

812
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,869
It's all in the family.
Stephanie and I have nothing to hide.

813
00:56:14,969 --> 00:56:18,111
- Let's change the subject.
- Look at her blushing. Isn't she cute?

814
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,036
She acts cold in public.
But when we're alone together, oh, boy.

815
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,585
I forgot you knew her as well as I do.
She's absolutely...

816
00:56:25,685 --> 00:56:28,240
- Let's have another drink.
- The party's dying.

817
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:33,589
There you are, Harvey.
I'm sorry I'm late, honey. Hello, everybody.

818
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,795
- Won't you sit down?
- No, she doesn't want to.

819
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,629
- We have to talk now. It's business.
- Did we have a date, or didn't we?

820
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,509
Excuse us.
She's the daughter of my TV sponsor.

821
00:56:45,609 --> 00:56:47,665
Silly debutante. I'll be right back.

822
00:56:47,765 --> 00:56:48,984
What are you doing?

823
00:56:49,084 --> 00:56:51,469
Quiet, or you'll be stuck
with your old teeth.

824
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,390
Would you excuse me, please?
I'll go and powder my nose.

825
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,398
- Do you want me to go with you?
- No, dear. I'm all right.

826
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,787
- Well, Julian.
- What's wrong?

827
00:57:08,887 --> 00:57:11,075
- He's a bum.
- I wouldn't say that.

828
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,944
But earlier I saw her slip some money
to him under the table.

829
00:57:15,044 --> 00:57:18,112
- That doesn't mean anything.
- Did you get a load of that girl?

830
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,026
I wasn't paying much attention.

831
00:57:20,126 --> 00:57:23,556
When she bent over it looked
like she had her knees up inside her dress.

832
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:29,395
I could give a dozen explanations,
but you might as well know the real one.

833
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,199
- I'm a member of the CIA.
- The CIA?

834
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,398
- I thought you were a television actor.
- That's my cover.

835
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,948
So, if you see me with another girl,
pretend not to know me...

836
00:57:39,048 --> 00:57:40,951
...or it could put my life in danger.

837
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,591
I wouldn't want to do that.

838
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,948
It doesn't matter what we think of him.
It's my wife who loves him.

839
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,706
Loves him?
Didn't you see how humiliated she was?

840
00:57:51,806 --> 00:57:56,271
- What do you want me to do about it?
- We have got to save her from that man.

841
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,708
The man probably had
a little too much to drink.

842
00:57:59,808 --> 00:58:03,952
You keep defending him.
I'm angry you were so chummy with him.

843
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,793
Julian, my respect for you
is going down every minute.

844
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,952
- Is the party still going on?
- Not for you, Mr. Greenfield.

845
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,829
- I don't like how you treated my wife.
- A joke's a joke.

846
00:58:15,929 --> 00:58:19,464
And the way you behaved toward my girl.
I want you to leave quietly...

847
00:58:19,564 --> 00:58:21,915
...and never see my wife again.
Or my children.

848
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,466
Wait a minute, buster.

849
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:27,269
If I hear you've been bothering Stephanie,
I'll knock all your teeth out.

850
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,436
- You'll have to put them back in again.
- Get out!

851
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,631
I guess that'll take care of him.

852
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,355
You know, Julian, I've never seen you
being so physical before.

853
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,348
- You were beautiful.
- It was nothing.

854
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,026
Why don't we go over to your place
where we can be alone?

855
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:50,519
I'd like that.

856
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,588
I am a little tired, so I think I'll go home.
If you'll excuse me.

857
00:58:55,688 --> 00:58:58,274
You're going home alone?
Without an escort?

858
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:01,956
I'm used to that. Thank you. Good night.

859
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,876
Wait. Julian can drop me off
and then drive you home.

860
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,627
- No, I couldn't do that.
- He'd be glad to. Won't you, dear?

861
00:59:11,727 --> 00:59:13,119
It's all settled.

862
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:17,634
Thank you. It's been so long since
Julian and I have gone home together.

863
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,231
You're a great little fixer.

864
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,667
I'll dump her and then come to your place.

865
00:59:23,767 --> 00:59:26,267
No, Julian, not tonight. Stay with her.

866
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:29,947
- What am I going to do with her?
- You're gonna be very nice.

867
00:59:30,047 --> 00:59:32,998
- Now, wait a minute...
- Very nice, to please me.

868
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,667
Doctor, I know how anxious you are
to dump me and get back to Toni, so you...

869
00:59:40,767 --> 00:59:43,149
- I'm not going back there.
- You're not going back?

870
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,466
Toni thought you looked humiliated
and told me to stay with you.

871
00:59:46,566 --> 00:59:47,566
Stay with me?

872
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,958
Let's get our stories straight.

873
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:53,228
Are we supposed
to have spent the night together?

874
00:59:53,328 --> 00:59:56,278
No. I've thought it over
and I've decided to tell the truth.

875
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:00,309
I'll buy a present and tell the truth,
then she and I can get married.

876
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,476
- Then everything is fine.
- No, it isn't.

877
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,626
When she finds out that I lied,
she'll do something desperate.

878
01:00:05,726 --> 01:00:09,554
It's your fault. You tried to louse me up.
Harvey was trying his best back there.

879
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,906
- You didn't have to act so humiliated.
- I was humiliated.

880
01:00:14,006 --> 01:00:18,118
You have this hang-up about men
that destroys any possible relationship.

881
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,988
- That's what makes you hate Harvey.
- No one needs a reason to hate him.

882
01:00:22,088 --> 01:00:26,226
You de-feminize yourself.
I've noticed it around the office and me.

883
01:00:26,326 --> 01:00:29,465
I was hired as a nurse-receptionist,
not a geisha girl.

884
01:00:29,565 --> 01:00:33,439
You're afraid. Afraid of emotion,
afraid of intimacy, afraid to live.

885
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,028
If living is the way you carry on,
then you're right.

886
01:00:37,128 --> 01:00:39,076
I'm telling you this for your own good.

887
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:45,352
Funny, whenever people hurt your feelings,
they're always doing it for your own good.

888
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,312
Turn right at the next corner.

889
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,874
- Hi, Igor.
- Hi. You got <i>Ai: Da</i> with Callas?

890
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,993
Sure. You know,
I haven't heard your typewriter lately.

891
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:58,436
I'm too depressed to work.
I wish Mother had taken the pill.

892
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,586
- What's your problem, a girl?
- No, I've outgrown that stuff.

893
01:01:01,686 --> 01:01:04,399
Sex is for teenagers.
Seem to need something else.

894
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,558
- I don't know what.
- I know exactly how you feel.

895
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,629
- Can I read your play sometime?
- Yeah, it'd be nice if somebody did.

896
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,028
I'd like that.

897
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,913
- Want me to put it in a sack?
- No, I'll listen to it here.

898
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,076
Do you always stand up there like that?

899
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,916
Nobody around here looks.
Most of our customers are classical.

900
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,997
- What are you doing here?
- My lunch hour. I brought a present.

901
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:41,148
A present?
It isn't even my birthday or anything.

902
01:01:41,248 --> 01:01:42,275
Open it.

903
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,433
Let's go in the back.

904
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,234
- Gee, I wonder what could be in here.
- Guess.

905
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,277
- Black leather slacks.
- Can't you think bigger than that?

906
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,512
What could be bigger
than black leather slacks? Okay, I give up.

907
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,192
A mink stole!

908
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,432
A mink stole!

909
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,117
And a card, too.

910
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,111
"Your next appointment is on..."

911
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,111
"As ever, Julian." How sweet.

912
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,078
Aren't you going to try it on?

913
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,593
A mink stole.

914
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,915
Okay, what are you trying to tell me?

915
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,469
Why do you think
I'm trying to tell you something?

916
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:39,196
You're not stingy, but you're not
the last of the big-time spenders, either.

917
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,753
As a matter of fact, there was something
that I wanted to tell you.

918
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,189
- It's about me and my...
- Your wife?

919
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,276
- I get the message.
- You do?

920
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,745
Yeah.

921
01:02:54,845 --> 01:02:58,429
Last night, you and she...
For old <i>times'</i> sake.

922
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,199
That's absurd.

923
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,669
Don't apologize. After all,
it was I who told you to be nice to her.

924
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,794
Of course,
it was up to you to decide how nice.

925
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,594
Look, Toni, it's nothing like that.

926
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,828
You see, the fact is, Stephanie is...

927
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,592
- Yes?
- Miss Simmons.

928
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,670
Would you step in here
for a moment, please?

929
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,398
Yes, Mr. Shirley.

930
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,391
May I ask what's going on here?

931
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:28,716
This gentleman is looking for a stereo
to match the colour of his wife's mink.

932
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:33,954
When I think how many nuts are running
around loose in this town... Carry on.

933
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,554
Now, go ahead.
You were saying, Stephanie is...

934
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,919
Yes, you see, Stephanie is...

935
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,433
Come on, let's have it. You know me.
I can forgive anything but a lie.

936
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,594
Forget it.

937
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,797
Let me try to help.
You have a problem with Stephanie, right?

938
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,679
- Let's see, she drinks?
- No.

939
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,797
- She's a kleptomaniac?
- No.

940
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,033
She takes acid?

941
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,306
There's only one other thing I know a man
would really be ashamed to talk about.

942
01:04:05,406 --> 01:04:07,550
Stephanie is no nymphomaniac.

943
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,712
I guessed it.
That's what you came here to tell me?

944
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,107
- Give me all the details.
- What can I tell you?

945
01:04:17,207 --> 01:04:19,584
Except my wife is a slave to her desires.

946
01:04:19,684 --> 01:04:21,867
That's a very sweet way
of describing a nympho.

947
01:04:21,967 --> 01:04:24,025
You can imagine
what my life has been like.

948
01:04:24,125 --> 01:04:26,759
You've got to take the children
from her immediately.

949
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,712
Why? It's not catching.

950
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,634
You've got to fight her for custody.

951
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,586
Come to think of it,
the children don't look much like you.

952
01:04:36,686 --> 01:04:38,825
The whole thing
is too painful to talk about.

953
01:04:38,925 --> 01:04:41,673
You poor darling.
When I think of that awful woman.

954
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,029
What am I saying? She's not awful.
She's marvellous. I admire her courage.

955
01:04:46,129 --> 01:04:51,911
Now that the whole ugly story is out,
we'll never mention her name again.

956
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,305
You know what I was doing
when you arrived?

957
01:04:56,405 --> 01:04:59,907
Sending a present to Stephanie.
She likes Horowitz. What's her address?

958
01:05:00,007 --> 01:05:03,151
Just send it to the office.
Miss Dickinson will forward it.

959
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,792
- Hi.
- What do you mean by that? See you later.

960
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,716
This time I was dressed.

961
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,078
What have you got there?

962
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,476
It's mink. From Julian.

963
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:21,188
- My Aunt Bertha has one just like it.
- I know. I wanted black leather slacks.

964
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,787
Poor Julian.
He thought this would please me.

965
01:05:23,887 --> 01:05:27,829
It's a throwback to the days when a hunter
would give his wife the dead animal skins.

966
01:05:27,929 --> 01:05:29,905
Wonder how many minks Julian has killed?

967
01:05:30,005 --> 01:05:31,991
That's very unkind, Igor.

968
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,268
When I think of all the women
who would do anything for this...

969
01:05:35,368 --> 01:05:37,228
...and I don't really want it.

970
01:05:37,328 --> 01:05:40,306
This is my chance to do a good deed.

971
01:05:40,406 --> 01:05:43,551
I was going to send his wife records.
I'll send this mink instead.

972
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,509
What's wrong? She'll love it.

973
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:49,266
Mrs. Winston will never accept
a mink stole from you.

974
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:50,839
Where's that card?

975
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,912
"As ever, Julian."

976
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:58,638
That should do it.
Anyway, it's just sort of a care package.

977
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,474
Toni, you're a kook. But a nice kook.

978
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,147
<i>Señor</i> Sanchez, you're ten minutes early.

979
01:06:06,247 --> 01:06:08,913
Imagine, Arturo Sanchez
being early for the dentist.

980
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,068
- It is a new man, no?
- Certainly is.

981
01:06:11,168 --> 01:06:12,388
Today I hurried.

982
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,989
- Do you know why?
- <i>El Bravo</i> rides again.

983
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,625
The cowardly fear of the dentist
is completely overcome by the desire...

984
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:22,264
...to see the lovely Miss Dickinson.
- I'll tell Dr. Winston you're here.

985
01:06:22,364 --> 01:06:26,788
Wait. Do not call him yet.
Have you ever been to a diplomatic ball?

986
01:06:26,888 --> 01:06:30,866
- Me? It's a little out of my line.
- Tonight there will be such a function.

987
01:06:30,966 --> 01:06:34,032
It'll be boring, unless you accompany me.

988
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:37,345
- But your wife?
- Must we take my wife everywhere?

989
01:06:37,445 --> 01:06:39,744
She's spending a week at a fat farm.

990
01:06:39,844 --> 01:06:43,268
Thank you,
but I don't have the kind of clothes...

991
01:06:43,368 --> 01:06:46,825
I can buy you anything.
In a Swiss bank, I have $20 million.

992
01:06:46,925 --> 01:06:49,267
It's nice of you, but I'm afraid not.

993
01:06:49,367 --> 01:06:51,947
I must warn you,
the men in my family are persistent.

994
01:06:52,047 --> 01:06:53,749
Two hundred years after Columbus...

995
01:06:53,849 --> 01:06:56,798
...we persisted in thinking
that the world was flat.

996
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,071
Package for Mrs. Winston.

997
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:04,317
- Yes, I'll take it.
- I didn't know Dr. Winston was married.

998
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,749
It's always a shock
when it happens to someone you know.

999
01:07:07,849 --> 01:07:10,586
We're low on acrylic cement.
I wish you'd reorder it.

1000
01:07:10,686 --> 01:07:13,187
Yes, Doctor. I already did yesterday.

1001
01:07:13,287 --> 01:07:16,266
The firing squad. No, blindfold, huh?

1002
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:19,636
Doctor, this package just arrived
for Mrs. Winston.

1003
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,354
Yes, that's a present for you.

1004
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,711
- For me? From whom?
- One of your fans.

1005
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,111
"As ever, Julian."

1006
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,160
For me.

1007
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:27,600
From Julian.

1008
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,558
Miss Dickinson,
the patient's x-rays, please.

1009
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,394
Yes, Doctor.

1010
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,109
I'm so overwhelmed.

1011
01:08:48,209 --> 01:08:50,589
That present...
I don't know how to thank you.

1012
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:54,834
- And that lovely card, "As ever, Julian."
- What?

1013
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,824
Yes, of course.

1014
01:08:57,924 --> 01:09:00,549
I wanted to get you something
I thought you'd like.

1015
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:02,756
You've put up with a lot from me lately.

1016
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,555
I never dreamed I...
I never expected anything like this.

1017
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,474
It's all right, if you like Horowitz.

1018
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,070
Horowitz? Must be the name of the furrier.

1019
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:28,959
- These are Harvey Greenfield's x-rays.
- I'm so sorry, Doctor.

1020
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,998
What is it, Doctor?

1021
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:56,908
Is there something wrong with my x-ray?
You know how nervous I am.

1022
01:09:57,008 --> 01:10:00,704
Hello, Anna. I want you to run over
to Lucille's Dress Shop.

1023
01:10:00,804 --> 01:10:03,626
There's an evening dress there.
I want you to buy it for me.

1024
01:10:03,726 --> 01:10:05,517
I need it tonight. I'm going to a ball.

1025
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:11,514
Doctor, you can tell me the truth.
It is an abscess?

1026
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,632
The nerve is dead?

1027
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,551
All my teeth have to go?
But, Doctor, talk to me, please.

1028
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,227
Is she your dearest friend?

1029
01:10:22,327 --> 01:10:25,146
Do you realise
how much I paid for that mink?

1030
01:10:25,246 --> 01:10:27,827
You're never going to stop nagging me
about it.

1031
01:10:27,927 --> 01:10:30,869
You're beginning to sound
just like a husband.

1032
01:10:30,969 --> 01:10:32,598
A square husband.

1033
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,028
- You said you wanted to read my play.
- Thanks, Igor.

1034
01:10:38,128 --> 01:10:42,106
- What are you doing for dinner tonight?
- It depends. What have you got?

1035
01:10:42,206 --> 01:10:44,787
We're going out for dinner.
You want to come with us?

1036
01:10:44,887 --> 01:10:46,711
I'm sure Igor would be very bored.

1037
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,707
Not if you're paying. I'll put on a tie.

1038
01:10:49,807 --> 01:10:52,519
Why?
Are you having your beads re-strung?

1039
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,987
I thought we were going to have
a quiet little dinner?

1040
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,913
- Igor's very depressed.
- There's a lot of that going around.

1041
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:31,559
- Why'd we come back here?
- We won't bump into Dr. Winston.

1042
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,224
Why don't you want to
bump into Dr. Winston?

1043
01:11:34,324 --> 01:11:36,675
Let me put it to you this way: Shut up.

1044
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,553
Hello. How are you?

1045
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:53,315
- Sore as hell, that's how I am.
- I don't blame you, Harvey, but...

1046
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,429
You treated me like dirt
and you were Mr. Clean.

1047
01:11:56,529 --> 01:11:58,026
I'm having a rough time.

1048
01:11:58,126 --> 01:12:00,584
As long as I was lying to her,
everything was fine.

1049
01:12:00,684 --> 01:12:04,347
The minute I decided to do the right thing
and marry her, I've had troubles.

1050
01:12:04,447 --> 01:12:08,586
You wouldn't believe the complications.
It's like waltzing in wet cement.

1051
01:12:08,686 --> 01:12:12,275
I haven't even been able
to spend one night alone with her.

1052
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,875
I'd better get back, Harvey,
before she sees us together.

1053
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:28,319
If you work for the CIA,
how come you hang around with dentists?

1054
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:33,033
He's installing a miniature
radio transmitter in my wisdom tooth.

1055
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,147
What were you doing
talking to that awful man?

1056
01:12:37,247 --> 01:12:39,704
I was getting lonesome
for the sound of a human voice.

1057
01:12:39,804 --> 01:12:42,030
- Can I have a glass of beer?
- Not yours.

1058
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,596
Why did we have to come here tonight?

1059
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:49,588
After last time, it's the one place
we're sure not to run into your wife.

1060
01:12:49,688 --> 01:12:53,309
This is very interesting.
What made you suggest this?

1061
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,036
It's the one place
we're sure not to run into my boss.

1062
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,908
Thank you, Arturo.
The ball was marvellous.

1063
01:13:02,008 --> 01:13:05,108
No. You were marvellous.
What shall we drink?

1064
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:07,509
Let's have some of that
crazy Idaho champagne.

1065
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,511
Look at that!

1066
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,710
I can hardly believe that's Stephanie.

1067
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:16,717
It is. I recognise the mink.

1068
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:21,144
That gown is absolute poetry.
Everybody at the ball was staring at it.

1069
01:13:21,244 --> 01:13:22,514
It's a copy of a copy.

1070
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,104
A girl like you
should have nothing but originals.

1071
01:13:25,204 --> 01:13:27,668
In a Swiss bank, I have $20 million...

1072
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,948
Didn't take her long to find somebody else.

1073
01:13:30,048 --> 01:13:33,112
- Let me in on this? Who is that woman?
- Julian's wife.

1074
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,312
Not bad, Julian.

1075
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,069
- As a matter of fact, she's very attractive.
- Thank you.

1076
01:13:38,169 --> 01:13:42,438
- I didn't know you went for the older ones.
- Look who's talking.

1077
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,318
- There's Dr. Winston.
- Where?

1078
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,868
Oh, dear!
It seems I can't get away from that man.

1079
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:52,306
Would you like to leave?

1080
01:13:52,406 --> 01:13:54,784
Let's ignore him.
My evenings are my own.

1081
01:13:54,884 --> 01:13:57,269
- What about weekends?
- They belong to my nephews.

1082
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:01,945
- Oh, I see.
- <i>El Bravo,</i> you're not giving up, are you?

1083
01:14:02,045 --> 01:14:03,104
Of course not.

1084
01:14:03,204 --> 01:14:06,308
Did I tell you the time
I played polo with a broken leg?

1085
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:07,833
No, tell me about it.

1086
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:11,914
Isn't that the woman from the other night?

1087
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,986
Yeah, I believe you're right.

1088
01:14:14,086 --> 01:14:17,225
- Who is she?
- That's the dentist's wife.

1089
01:14:17,325 --> 01:14:20,630
- Who's with the dentist?
- That's his fiancée.

1090
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:25,788
- He has a wife and a fiancée?
- It's better than having two wives.

1091
01:14:25,888 --> 01:14:29,156
- Who's the man with Mrs. Winston?
- New boyfriend.

1092
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,834
Who's the guy
with Dr. Winston and his girl?

1093
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:36,158
- That must be her boyfriend.
- I think the whole thing is shocking.

1094
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,714
Shall we?

1095
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,430
- Look at them dancing.
- You're not jealous, are you?

1096
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:01,708
She shouldn't leave her mink
lying around like that...

1097
01:15:01,808 --> 01:15:03,146
...someone may take it.

1098
01:15:03,246 --> 01:15:05,913
- It's her mink now.
- Come on, let's dance.

1099
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,506
Here we are again.

1100
01:15:13,606 --> 01:15:16,637
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Good evening, patient.

1101
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,029
You're certainly blossoming out.

1102
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,666
You once compared me to my cactus plant.

1103
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:27,949
Every so often that prickly little thing
puts out a flower that some people think...

1104
01:15:28,049 --> 01:15:31,345
Miss Dickinson, I strongly disapprove
of you making dates with patients.

1105
01:15:31,445 --> 01:15:34,273
Really? Then how come
you fixed me up with Harvey?

1106
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:45,546
Look at them acting so damn polite.
They're all rotten.

1107
01:15:45,646 --> 01:15:47,827
What do you want them to do,
kick each other?

1108
01:15:47,927 --> 01:15:49,239
Rotten, rotten.

1109
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:51,951
No, Julian, like this.

1110
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,715
That looks like fun. Let us try it.

1111
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,352
That's it, Stephanie.

1112
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,078
I've got it, huh?

1113
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:12,194
- Hi, Sergeant.
- Hi, Harv.

1114
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,557
Boy, you're terrific.

1115
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:28,505
They've lost me. You go dance with her.

1116
01:16:28,605 --> 01:16:32,036
Cheer up. One of these days
the fox trot may come back.

1117
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:42,748
- Introduce us.
- Mrs. Winston, this is Igor Sullivan.

1118
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:46,037
- That's not his real name, of course.
- Of course.

1119
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:53,274
- What is that?
- The Uptight.

1120
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,989
- And what is this?
- The Booga-loo.

1121
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:06,715
What's that?

1122
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,119
- A new step.
- What's it called?

1123
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,999
The Dentist.

1124
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:30,352
- Are you sulking again?
- I got bored dancing with <i>Señor</i> Sanchez.

1125
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,871
Well, thank you, Igor.

1126
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,237
I should have brought my wife.

1127
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,950
You must feel as if you were dancing
with your mother.

1128
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:50,344
- Quiet, I'm enjoying this.
- So am I.

1129
01:17:50,444 --> 01:17:54,069
Then relax.
Let's not get neurotic about age.

1130
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,308
- You're a very sexy lady.
- An old sexy lady.

1131
01:17:57,408 --> 01:17:58,408
Good.

1132
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,233
Let's run away
and live on your social security.

1133
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:06,599
I must say, that Igor of yours
is a pretty vulgar dancer.

1134
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:10,309
What do you mean, Igor?
She's plastering herself against him.

1135
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,830
When I think of all I've done for her.

1136
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,549
Did you see that?
He just kissed her on the neck.

1137
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:25,425
- She sure likes a lot of action.
- Yes, she does, doesn't she?

1138
01:18:25,525 --> 01:18:27,988
Right now she's surrounded by:
Her husband...

1139
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:32,398
...her ex-boyfriend, her current boyfriend,
and maybe her future boyfriend.

1140
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,785
If somebody doesn't stop that guy...

1141
01:18:34,885 --> 01:18:37,519
...he'll make love to her
in the middle of the floor.

1142
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,112
Wait, Igor! Our song!

1143
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,839
Come on. Let's get out of here.

1144
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:42,546
Maybe I shouldn't leave her alone
when she's like this.

1145
01:19:42,646 --> 01:19:43,646
Leave her alone?

1146
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,911
That's some talk
for a man who's planning a divorce.

1147
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,628
Make sure that gets home all right.

1148
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,993
- Rotten, rotten, rotten.
- Rotten, rotten.

1149
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:08,229
Everything you told me
about your wife was true.

1150
01:20:08,329 --> 01:20:12,748
- She's not a lady. She's a barracuda.
- I don't care to discuss it anymore.

1151
01:20:12,848 --> 01:20:15,513
Some poor schnook
is getting his car towed away.

1152
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:20,069
Hey, wait a minute, that's my car!
Come back here!

1153
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:32,840
Here.

1154
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:08,628
- Good morning, Doctor.
- That's how you're coming to work?

1155
01:21:08,728 --> 01:21:11,598
- I didn't have time to go home.
- Where were you all night?

1156
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,549
It's all a blur. A beautiful, blurry blur.

1157
01:21:14,649 --> 01:21:18,589
When you left the club
you were doing fairly well, blurry-wise.

1158
01:21:18,689 --> 01:21:21,230
It didn't really get started
until after you left.

1159
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:25,199
- I'm sure that must have helped.
- Everybody got to know everybody and...

1160
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,064
...about 3:00 we were invited to this bash.

1161
01:21:28,164 --> 01:21:29,513
- "Bash"?
- A party.

1162
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,355
In this pad, on Waverly Place.

1163
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:48,625
Did you ever have a gin and tonic
made with tequila?

1164
01:21:48,725 --> 01:21:52,076
- No, thank you. Tequila and tonic?
- No.

1165
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,586
You substitute the tequila.
No, you substitute the tonic for the tequila.

1166
01:21:56,686 --> 01:21:58,026
The tequila for the tonic?

1167
01:21:58,126 --> 01:21:59,945
- Yes, they call it...
- Gin and tequila?

1168
01:22:00,045 --> 01:22:03,953
- Yes. They call it the Mexican Measles.
- Missile.

1169
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,836
They tell me it prevents malaria.

1170
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,185
You know what I've done?
Created a monster.

1171
01:22:11,285 --> 01:22:14,388
No, Dr. Frankenstein,
this was not creation of yours, this is me.

1172
01:22:14,488 --> 01:22:17,269
Me, experiencing new things
that I've never done before.

1173
01:22:17,369 --> 01:22:19,191
Having a hell of a good time.

1174
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:22,988
- You were there all night fighting malaria?
- No, we went to the beach.

1175
01:22:23,088 --> 01:22:26,268
We wanted fresh air,
so we drove out to Coney Island.

1176
01:22:26,368 --> 01:22:28,744
It's lovely at dawn. Nobody around.

1177
01:22:28,844 --> 01:22:31,027
We sat there
and watched the sun come up.

1178
01:22:31,127 --> 01:22:35,955
- On the beach in your new mink stole?
- A little sand won't hurt it.

1179
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,398
I had to lie on something.

1180
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,509
Wait. You said you were sitting.
Were you sitting or lying?

1181
01:22:41,609 --> 01:22:44,788
A little of this and a little of that.
You should have come with us.

1182
01:22:44,888 --> 01:22:47,509
There wouldn't have been room
for all of us on the mink.

1183
01:22:47,609 --> 01:22:50,273
Anyway, I'm sure
you prefer to be with Toni.

1184
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:53,828
- I forgot all about her.
- What's the matter?

1185
01:22:53,928 --> 01:22:58,755
I left her standing outside the discotheque.
I hope she had sense enough to go home.

1186
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:03,069
It's just not practical
to keep one in the city.

1187
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,949
- A girl?
- No, a car.

1188
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,031
I didn't wake you, did I?

1189
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,398
I wanted to make sure
you got home all right.

1190
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,509
No, I didn't get it.

1191
01:23:19,609 --> 01:23:24,549
I went to the police station. They told me
to try a garage on the East Side.

1192
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,918
When I got there they told me
to try the West Side.

1193
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:32,074
When I got there, it was closed.
I couldn't find a cab so I had to walk home.

1194
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,587
I should have listened to my mother
and become an M.D.

1195
01:23:35,687 --> 01:23:37,750
They let you park anywhere.

1196
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,070
Yeah, okay. You go back to bed.
I'll see you tonight. Right.

1197
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,909
- Did she get home?
- Yes, more than I can say for you.

1198
01:23:46,009 --> 01:23:49,268
- My cactus. It's blooming!
- Never mind that.

1199
01:23:49,368 --> 01:23:52,309
What about your night of debauchery
with <i>Señor</i> Sanchez?

1200
01:23:52,409 --> 01:23:55,508
Why who said anything about him?
We lost him early in the evening.

1201
01:23:55,608 --> 01:23:57,505
- "We"? Who's "we"?
- Igor and I.

1202
01:23:57,605 --> 01:23:59,904
You mean,
you spent the night with that hippie?

1203
01:24:00,004 --> 01:24:03,385
You're wrong about Igor.
He's sensitive and sincere and very poetic.

1204
01:24:03,485 --> 01:24:06,828
- "Poetic"? I saw him kiss you on the neck.
- He's friendly.

1205
01:24:06,928 --> 01:24:09,470
There's no such thing
as a friendly kiss on the neck.

1206
01:24:09,570 --> 01:24:12,705
It's grotesque, a woman your age
throwing yourself at a kid.

1207
01:24:12,805 --> 01:24:15,429
What about that father-and-daughter
thing of yours?

1208
01:24:15,529 --> 01:24:18,027
- That looks ridiculous.
- It's different with a man.

1209
01:24:18,127 --> 01:24:20,265
A man with a younger woman
looks appropriate.

1210
01:24:20,365 --> 01:24:24,144
- When it's the other way around...
- You go to your church and I'll go to mine.

1211
01:24:24,244 --> 01:24:26,145
It wasn't easy for me to do what I did.

1212
01:24:26,245 --> 01:24:29,348
- When I felt shaky, I thought about you.
- It was obvious.

1213
01:24:29,448 --> 01:24:32,346
Thinking about all of those terrible things
you said to me.

1214
01:24:32,446 --> 01:24:34,787
I was determined
to make up for the time I'd lost.

1215
01:24:34,887 --> 01:24:36,589
And I intend to keep on doing it.

1216
01:24:36,689 --> 01:24:39,797
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to take an Alka-Seltzer.

1217
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,876
I don't mind saying
I'm disappointed in you, Miss Dickinson.

1218
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:50,390
Doctor, you're the one who said
I was discouraging men.

1219
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,269
Stifling my femininity.

1220
01:24:52,369 --> 01:24:56,346
For the first time, an attractive young man
pays attention to me, you go to pieces.

1221
01:24:56,446 --> 01:24:59,389
If I didn't know you so well,
I'd almost swear you're jealous.

1222
01:24:59,489 --> 01:25:02,146
Jealous? Of you?
Come now, Miss Dickinson.

1223
01:25:02,246 --> 01:25:06,024
I think it's very bad taste when,
under my eyes and those of my fiancée...

1224
01:25:06,124 --> 01:25:10,910
...my wife puts on an immoral exhibition
with someone young enough to be her son.

1225
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:17,680
All right, look,
so you had a little fling last night.

1226
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:21,025
Nobody's knocking it.
After all, there was no harm done.

1227
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:24,026
Why don't you come out
and ask me if I went to bed with him?

1228
01:25:24,126 --> 01:25:26,989
- Did you go to bed with him?
- It's none of your business.

1229
01:25:27,089 --> 01:25:29,065
What happened out there
on my mink stole?

1230
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:30,985
I mean, the beach? I want to know.

1231
01:25:31,085 --> 01:25:32,746
- By what right?
- A husband's right.

1232
01:25:32,846 --> 01:25:34,985
Let me remind you
that you're still my wife!

1233
01:25:35,085 --> 01:25:36,746
No more! I want a divorce!

1234
01:25:36,846 --> 01:25:40,196
- After all the years of misery, I've had.
- Years of misery?

1235
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:43,788
All those mornings when I came in
and found hairpins on the couch...

1236
01:25:43,888 --> 01:25:46,110
...lipstick on the mouthwash glasses.

1237
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,306
You've been spying on me?
You want to play rough.

1238
01:25:49,406 --> 01:25:52,386
I'll tell the world about your drunkenness,
your wild parties.

1239
01:25:52,486 --> 01:25:53,789
Your orgies on the beach!

1240
01:25:53,889 --> 01:25:56,105
You want a divorce?
It's I who wants a divorce.

1241
01:25:56,205 --> 01:25:58,750
I'll call the registry
and have them send another nurse.

1242
01:25:58,850 --> 01:26:00,558
Give this to your child-concubine.

1243
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,307
Stephanie, you walk out now,
don't come back!

1244
01:26:03,407 --> 01:26:07,439
Don't worry, you won't see me again.
That goes for the children, too!

1245
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,024
How late were you two out?

1246
01:26:12,124 --> 01:26:14,190
I thought you came here
to talk about my play?

1247
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:16,715
I'll wait till they make it into a movie.

1248
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,946
I have a right to know what went on.
She's my fiancé's wife.

1249
01:26:22,046 --> 01:26:23,669
I'd rather not discuss the lady.

1250
01:26:23,769 --> 01:26:26,586
I happen to know this particular lady
swings with anybody.

1251
01:26:26,686 --> 01:26:30,434
- Then I guess I'm not anybody.
- You mean, nothing?

1252
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,309
She didn't want to, huh?

1253
01:26:32,409 --> 01:26:35,466
- Maybe I didn't want to.
- I doubt that.

1254
01:26:35,566 --> 01:26:37,907
I saw the way you kissed her neck
like Dracula.

1255
01:26:38,007 --> 01:26:41,117
All we did was dance a lot,
drink a lot, talk a lot.

1256
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,744
- About what?
- About my work, about myself.

1257
01:26:43,844 --> 01:26:46,400
It isn't often
I find a woman I enjoy talking to.

1258
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,865
- Are you implying you can't talk to me?
- Come to think of it, I can't.

1259
01:26:49,965 --> 01:26:53,866
You're always talking and it's always
about your troubles with that tooth jockey.

1260
01:26:53,966 --> 01:26:56,749
Julian is a fine man
and much too good for his wife.

1261
01:26:56,849 --> 01:27:00,150
- You ought to know what I know.
- I know what I know. She's a dame.

1262
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:02,787
She's good-looking, smart,
warm, very appealing.

1263
01:27:02,887 --> 01:27:06,584
- You did want to!
- For God's sake, Toni, act your age.

1264
01:27:06,684 --> 01:27:08,477
Or rather, don't act your age.

1265
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:15,186
- Dracula, it's for you.
- I want to talk to you.

1266
01:27:15,286 --> 01:27:17,794
- Hi. How's your head today?
- Which one?

1267
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:21,308
- Igor, do you mind if I talk to...
- Of course not.

1268
01:27:21,408 --> 01:27:24,551
- Wait, I live here.
- You can wait in my place.

1269
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,344
- And I used to worry about you.
- That's what caused all the trouble.

1270
01:27:32,444 --> 01:27:33,946
You and Igor, that child.

1271
01:27:34,046 --> 01:27:37,228
I don't want to talk about Igor.
I want to talk about Julian and me.

1272
01:27:37,328 --> 01:27:38,949
All right. Are you keeping him?

1273
01:27:39,049 --> 01:27:40,908
Or can you spare him? I want to know.

1274
01:27:41,008 --> 01:27:43,709
There is something else.
I'm going straight to the point.

1275
01:27:43,809 --> 01:27:46,951
I have no patience when people
shilly-shally about these things.

1276
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,348
Julian and I...

1277
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:57,307
Oh, my God, it isn't as easy as I thought.

1278
01:27:57,407 --> 01:27:59,675
I think I can guess. You're pregnant.

1279
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,984
Pregnant? Whatever gave you that idea?

1280
01:28:03,084 --> 01:28:06,268
The night Julian took you home.
Why not? You're still Mrs. Winston.

1281
01:28:06,368 --> 01:28:08,191
I am not Mrs. Winston.

1282
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,189
I'm Miss Dickinson.

1283
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:15,153
Miss Dickinson?

1284
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,631
But you...

1285
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:22,912
The old maid.

1286
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,629
That's ridiculous.

1287
01:28:27,729 --> 01:28:30,104
That's what I think.
Well, I hate to be the one...

1288
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:32,077
Now, let's not get excited.

1289
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,588
- You're Miss Dickinson, Julian's nurse.
- Right.

1290
01:28:35,688 --> 01:28:37,910
Well, then, who's Mrs. Winston?

1291
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:41,794
But there is no Mrs. Winston.
Julian isn't married.

1292
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,513
Never has been.

1293
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,825
This is a trick, isn't it?

1294
01:28:47,925 --> 01:28:50,267
You're trying to confuse me,
so I'll do something.

1295
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:53,309
You'll get to keep him for yourself,
along with Harvey, Igor...

1296
01:28:53,409 --> 01:28:56,198
...and that South American. He lied to me.

1297
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:05,713
I'm sorry, Toni.
I know this is a shock for anyone.

1298
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,594
Even greater for someone with your youth
and idealism, but...

1299
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,876
That dirty son of a bitch!

1300
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:15,597
Well, that's one way of looking at it.
Toni, wait!

1301
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,268
- Toni, Julian loves you.
- Why did he lie?

1302
01:29:19,368 --> 01:29:23,389
- He isn't bad. Just a little weak.
- A weak man, but a strong liar.

1303
01:29:23,489 --> 01:29:25,907
When I think of all those
thousands of details...

1304
01:29:26,007 --> 01:29:28,666
...he told me about his married life,
his children.

1305
01:29:28,766 --> 01:29:32,230
- Why don't... Could I...
- What are we playing, Odd Man Out?

1306
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:34,866
Damn it, I've been swindled!

1307
01:29:34,966 --> 01:29:38,989
Toni, Julian is marrying you.
A lot of girls would leap at such a swindle.

1308
01:29:39,089 --> 01:29:42,146
I know you're expecting Julian
and I don't want to run into him.

1309
01:29:42,246 --> 01:29:44,390
How come you decided
to unmess this mess?

1310
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:47,349
Let's say, Miss Dickinson's
a very conscientious nurse...

1311
01:29:47,449 --> 01:29:49,635
...and likes to tidy up before she goes.

1312
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:55,876
Sooner or later, Julian will break down
and tell you the truth on his own.

1313
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:59,636
Please help him. Accept him.

1314
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:03,079
A man who lies cannot love.

1315
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:07,956
That sounds like something
out of a fortune cookie.

1316
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:14,871
Dirty, married bachelor.

1317
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,512
What did you want?

1318
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:52,585
- What's this all about?
- Never mind. Kiss me again.

1319
01:30:52,685 --> 01:30:55,638
Okay, but after this one,
I want a complete explanation.

1320
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,514
- Is that Julian?
- What if it is?

1321
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:03,906
I don't know what your game is,
but you're not going to use me.

1322
01:31:04,006 --> 01:31:05,426
I'm getting out of here.

1323
01:31:05,526 --> 01:31:07,511
- How? He's right outside.
- Easy.

1324
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Toni?

1325
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:18,067
I thought you'd never answer.
What were you doing?

1326
01:31:18,167 --> 01:31:22,029
- Getting rid of my lover.
- Come on. Please. Not tonight.

1327
01:31:22,129 --> 01:31:25,510
Tonight I need all your help
and understanding.

1328
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,358
What do you mean?

1329
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,388
Well, I have something to tell you
and it's tough.

1330
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:34,151
You've come to tell me the truth.

1331
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:39,388
Don't worry, darling.
If you've come to tell me the truth...

1332
01:31:39,488 --> 01:31:41,189
You are going to tell me the truth?

1333
01:31:41,289 --> 01:31:44,272
Go ahead, sweetheart.
I promise everything will be all right.

1334
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,074
Thanks, my love. You're just marvellous.

1335
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,630
This isn't going to be easy. Here it is.

1336
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:54,112
My wife, Stephanie,
has changed her mind about the divorce.

1337
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,230
Try to remain calm, dear.
It was a blow to me, too.

1338
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,038
Oh, you poor man.

1339
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,747
Now, let's see if I can get this straight.

1340
01:32:05,847 --> 01:32:08,304
Your wife suddenly refuses
to give you a divorce?

1341
01:32:08,404 --> 01:32:10,545
- Hard to believe, isn't it?
- Very.

1342
01:32:10,645 --> 01:32:12,705
- When did she tell you this?
- This morning.

1343
01:32:12,805 --> 01:32:15,264
I fought like a tiger. I pleaded with her.

1344
01:32:15,364 --> 01:32:18,149
I offered her the house, money,
the car, more money.

1345
01:32:18,249 --> 01:32:20,276
She and her lawyer say, "No."

1346
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:23,946
You can divorce her.
You have grounds, all those lovers.

1347
01:32:24,046 --> 01:32:26,387
I can't because of the children
and she knows it.

1348
01:32:26,487 --> 01:32:29,785
So, she's got us over a barrel.
I'm absolutely sick about it.

1349
01:32:29,885 --> 01:32:31,589
Well, what happens to me now?

1350
01:32:31,689 --> 01:32:34,353
We'll go right on seeing each other
as before.

1351
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,749
We'll manage to snatch
a few scraps of happiness from life.

1352
01:32:37,849 --> 01:32:41,464
- It's a compromise, I know...
- Dear, if that's the way it has to be...

1353
01:32:41,564 --> 01:32:44,438
Baby, how wonderfully well
you're taking it.

1354
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:47,907
You'll see,
we'll be even happier than before.

1355
01:32:48,007 --> 01:32:51,225
It's not such a bad arrangement.
And it is fair.

1356
01:32:51,325 --> 01:32:55,029
You'll still have your wife, and me,
I'll still have you and Igor.

1357
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,280
Igor?

1358
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,508
But you said you were just friends.

1359
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:06,995
You were lying to me?

1360
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:11,030
I'm ashamed to admit it.
I know you hate the thought of a lie.

1361
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:14,910
Come on, Toni.
You're just putting me on, aren't you?

1362
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:21,786
What's that for?

1363
01:33:21,886 --> 01:33:25,316
That's our signal that the coast is clear
and he can come over.

1364
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:28,349
If I thought for one moment
that you and he...

1365
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:31,948
You realise if he walks through that door,
it's all finished between us?

1366
01:33:32,048 --> 01:33:33,996
I realise that.

1367
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,599
You called me?

1368
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,625
What are you doing
coming through the window?

1369
01:33:40,725 --> 01:33:43,280
Can't expect me
to come through the hall like that.

1370
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:48,395
- Julian, don't feel too bad.
- I'll be fine, Toni.

1371
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,309
You broke up my home.

1372
01:33:50,409 --> 01:33:53,386
You took me from my wife.
You alienated me from my children.

1373
01:33:53,486 --> 01:33:57,439
But, thank God,
I still have one thing left: My integrity.

1374
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:06,230
Now, would you mind
letting me in on this?

1375
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:08,428
Why don't you
have dinner with me tonight?

1376
01:34:08,528 --> 01:34:12,559
- Okay. I'll put some clothes on.
- Don't go to all that trouble just for me.

1377
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,278
I thought you quit.

1378
01:35:12,040 --> 01:35:13,828
I came to pick up my cactus.

1379
01:35:13,928 --> 01:35:16,267
What are you doing in the office
on a Saturday?

1380
01:35:16,367 --> 01:35:20,672
Last night I had twelve Mexican Missiles.
This is where I splashed down.

1381
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:24,425
- Is everything all right with you and Toni?
- Things are straightened out.

1382
01:35:24,525 --> 01:35:27,557
I might add,
without your help and interference.

1383
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:30,037
I'm so happy for you.

1384
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:34,229
Well, I'm not very happy for me.
Toni and I have split up.

1385
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:35,800
What?

1386
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:39,715
I went to see her and I told her
that you wouldn't agree to a divorce.

1387
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,584
- Very clever.
- What's so funny?

1388
01:35:43,684 --> 01:35:46,708
Nothing, except that I went and told her
that we weren't married.

1389
01:35:46,808 --> 01:35:49,067
- Why'd you do that?
- I thought I'd fix things.

1390
01:35:49,167 --> 01:35:51,799
At least somebody
would get what he wanted.

1391
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:55,069
You just can't stop making
chicken and egg sandwiches.

1392
01:35:55,169 --> 01:35:56,985
Why did you have to go there and lie?

1393
01:35:57,085 --> 01:36:00,470
Because it was the only way
I could get out of marrying her.

1394
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,785
- Don't you want to marry her?
- No.

1395
01:36:02,885 --> 01:36:06,190
It's always been a mistake,
and when I caught her with Igor, I knew it.

1396
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,026
But she thinks Igor is a child.

1397
01:36:08,126 --> 01:36:11,106
I saw him come through the window
with a diaper on.

1398
01:36:11,206 --> 01:36:14,266
He made me feel like an idiot.
I got out as fast as I could.

1399
01:36:14,366 --> 01:36:17,069
I understand why you went out
and got drunk.

1400
01:36:17,169 --> 01:36:20,146
You don't understand.
You see, when I left there, I was angry.

1401
01:36:20,246 --> 01:36:22,587
Furious! Homicidal!

1402
01:36:22,687 --> 01:36:25,788
- So you killed a quart of tequila?
- Please, stop interrupting.

1403
01:36:25,888 --> 01:36:29,345
I was sore as hell at Toni,
and then suddenly it was like magic.

1404
01:36:29,445 --> 01:36:32,947
My anger disappeared and
I suddenly felt a delicious sense of relief.

1405
01:36:33,047 --> 01:36:36,388
I said to myself,
"Julian, thank God, at last you're out of it.

1406
01:36:36,488 --> 01:36:38,226
"You can go home to your wife."

1407
01:36:38,326 --> 01:36:42,386
I bounced down the stairs, singing,
and I suddenly remembered I had no wife.

1408
01:36:42,486 --> 01:36:44,465
When I got home, there'd be nobody.

1409
01:36:44,565 --> 01:36:47,711
When I got back to the office,
you wouldn't be here either.

1410
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,719
So then you hung one on.
It's marvellous, Doc.

1411
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:53,355
That's very nice, Doctor.

1412
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:58,192
- Stephanie.
- Doctor.

1413
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:02,070
I think I'm going to kiss you.

1414
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:05,310
When will you know for sure?

1415
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:18,952
- I plan to do this often.
- I'll make a note to remind you.

1416
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:27,149
It's funny,
I feel as if you've always been my wife.

1417
01:37:27,249 --> 01:37:31,438
- We don't have to bother getting married.
- Well, just as a matter of form.

1418
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,717
Dr. Winston's office.

1419
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:43,153
No, he isn't in on Saturdays.
Can I take a message?

1420
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:46,519
Just a minute.

1421
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:49,189
It's a young lady.

1422
01:37:49,289 --> 01:37:51,467
She's a stewardess
with Australian Airlines.

1423
01:37:51,567 --> 01:37:53,312
She's free this evening.

1424
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:56,623
Tell her I've been grounded.

1425
01:37:57,983 --> 01:38:01,422
Sorry, Miss. But Dr. Winston
doesn't do that sort of work anymore.
