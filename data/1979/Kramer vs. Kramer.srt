00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,782
I love you, Billy.

3
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,055
I love you too, Mommy.

4
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,797
Night-night.

5
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,335
Sleep tight.

6
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,765
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

7
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,970
I'll see you in the morning light.

8
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,487
I love you.

9
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,018
They're going to make me
an assistant art director.

10
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:06,777
So Kenny says:

11
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,511
"You get yourself a Burberry coat.

12
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,384
If you're gonna be Madison Avenue,
you have to look it."

13
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,186
Saturday afternoon, I go out,
and it's cold.

14
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,454
I go to this place
that specializes in Burberrys...

15
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,463
...and say, "I want a Burberry coat,
37 short."

16
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,569
They put it on,
and I look beautiful in it.

17
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:26,998
I say, "I'll buy it."

18
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,402
And right then, I start to sweat.

19
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:33,703
I take my checkbook out, start to
sign the check, and my hand shakes...

20
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,743
...because I'm so scared.

21
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,482
- Good night.
- Where you going?

22
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,551
- I gotta get home.
- Oh, Jesus, I gotta go.

23
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,085
Okay, so let me finish.

24
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,881
So I sign it,
and my hand starts shaking...

25
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,988
Who is this? Danny, right?
Taxi!

26
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,565
- Come on, I gotta tell you something.
- I can't. I gotta get home.

27
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,497
Gotta talk to you
about something important.

28
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,230
I'm putting you in charge
of the Mid-Atlantic account.

29
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,158
By the end of the year, we'll
have them up to 10 million.

30
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,598
If this campaign works out the way
I know it will...

31
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,735
...they'll offer me a partnership.

32
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,372
That's terrific!

33
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:38,874
When that happens, I just want you
to know I'm taking you along.

34
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:44,205
Wow! Wow! That's terrific.

35
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,759
Joanna.

36
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,066
I'm home.

37
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,475
I forgot my keys. I gotta call
the office before they go.

38
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:16,237
Jo, you're gonna be real proud
of me. I got good news.

39
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,652
- Ted.
- One second. Let me just do this.

40
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,590
You know Jack Edwards in accounting?
He committed suicide.

41
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,921
Yeah, hi. Ted Kramer.

42
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:35,032
I gotta get those photos from
the retoucher by tomorrow morning.

43
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,964
- I'm leaving you.
- Honey, please. I can't hear.

44
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,472
Okay, you too. Thanks a lot.
See you tomorrow.

45
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,541
Did you guys eat?

46
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:45,709
I'm leaving you.

47
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,612
Here are my keys.

48
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,945
Here's my American Express,
my Bloomingdale's card...

49
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:58,021
...my checkbook. I've taken
$2000 out of our savings account.

50
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,488
That's what I had when we got married.

51
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,491
- Is this a joke?
- Here's the cleaning, laundry ticket.

52
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,891
You can pick them both up
on Saturday.

53
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,623
- You. You have to pick them up.
- What's wrong?

54
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,668
I paid the rent, the Con Ed bill,
and the phone bill, so...

55
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,702
You really pick your times to...

56
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:22,746
I'm sorry I was late, but I was
busy making a living, all right?

57
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,814
Come on, okay? Can we stop now?

58
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,213
So that's everything.

59
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,088
Enough, enough. All right?

60
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,387
What are you doing?

61
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:42,225
Where are you going? Just tell me
what I did that's so terrible.

62
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:43,866
- It's not you.
- Then what?

63
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,095
It's me. It's my fault.

64
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,062
You married the wrong person.

65
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,742
- I can't hack it.
- Let's just go inside.

66
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,069
I can't, I tried.
I swear...

67
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,179
Joanna, please, just... I'm sorry.

68
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:01,546
- No, please don't make me go in there.
- I just want to talk.

69
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,348
If you do, I swear, one day...

70
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,081
...I'll go right out the window.
- Oh, please.

71
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,624
Come on, now. What about Billy?

72
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,967
I'm not taking him with me.
I'm no good for him.

73
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,903
I'm terrible with him.

74
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,969
I have no patience.

75
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,267
He's better off without me.

76
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,946
Joanna, please.

77
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,117
And I don't love you anymore.

78
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,114
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

79
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:16,825
Hi, Margaret. This is Ted.
Is my wife there?

80
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:20,192
Yeah. Joanna come in?

81
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,766
We had a little fight. I thought
she might have stopped by.

82
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,304
If she comes in, tell her to come up
or just give me a ring.

83
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:34,339
Don't worry. She didn't take
her suitcase. She won't get very far.

84
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,848
I got work to do.
If she comes in, tell her to call me.

85
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,482
It's about time.

86
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,397
Joanna, that's the most insensitive...
Hi, Margaret.

87
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,500
- She packed a suitcase?
- Look, it's nothing serious, really.

88
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,705
She tell you where she was going?

89
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,702
- You tell me.
- How would I know? I wasn't here.

90
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,467
Clearly, you two had many
talks about my shortcomings...

91
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,704
...which I haven't been privy to.
And I'd love to talk...

92
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:13,213
...but I have a major presentation
in the morning...

93
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,319
...and I gotta get my work done.
So please allow me...

94
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,184
You don't realize
we have a serious problem.

95
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,361
Wrong. Me. I got the problem.
All you gotta do is...

96
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,995
...go out the door and go back to bed.

97
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,922
- The fact is...
- For six months...

98
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,761
...I've been spitting blood to get
this agency its biggest account.

99
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,097
And at five, we got it.

100
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:39,401
At eight, the vice president tells me
I'll be the next creative director.

101
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,206
I come through this door
to share with my wife...

102
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:46,181
...one of the five best days
of my life, and she looks at me...

103
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,013
...and tells me she doesn't want
to live with me!

104
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,121
Can't you understand
what she's done to me?

105
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,590
She loused up one of the five
best days of your life.

106
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,872
You're terrific. Boy, you're...

107
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,099
Thanks very much, really.

108
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,302
Sisterhood.

109
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,777
Thank you for coming
to cheer me up, but...

110
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,084
I didn't come to cheer you up.

111
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,250
I'm concerned about Joanna.

112
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:25,279
Maybe you can be concerned
in the privacy of your own apartment.

113
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:30,626
Joanna and I never had any problems
until you and Charley split up.

114
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,830
Oh, I don't believe you.

115
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,896
Just tell me the truth, okay?

116
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,795
Did you set her up to this?

117
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,969
No, I didn't put her up to this.

118
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,672
- Give her a little pep talk?
- No, I didn't.

119
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,898
Joanna and I talk a great deal.

120
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,270
And Joanna is a very unhappy woman.

121
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:51,006
And it took a lot of courage for her
to walk out of here.

122
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,276
How much courage does it take
to walk out on your kid?

123
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,994
Where's Mommy?

124
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,854
- What?
- Where's Mommy?

125
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,531
What time is it?

126
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:19,602
The little hand's on the 7, the big
hand's on the 9. Where's Mommy?

127
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,503
Oh, God. Okay, I'm gonna tell you.
You want to know where Mommy is?

128
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,045
- She's supposed to take me to school.
- She told me to do it.

129
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,217
Okay, I'll tell you where she went.

130
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:36,184
You know when you and your friends
don't get along and fight?

131
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,948
And you want to go and be alone
for a while?

132
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,853
Sometimes Mommy and Daddy
don't get along...

133
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:45,861
...and one of them wants to go
and be by themselves for a while.

134
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,397
- When is Mommy coming back?
- Soon.

135
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:52,126
Now we are gonna have breakfast!
Okay? Just you and me.

136
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,531
- What do you want?
- French toast.

137
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,931
You want French toast, you got it.

138
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,306
Put up a little water for Daddy
to have some coffee.

139
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,572
We got how many eggs?
Two for you and two for me.

140
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:04,874
We got milk.

141
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,584
We got butter.

142
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,583
We got $5.

143
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,279
I got $5.
Here, you sit here.

144
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,889
Okay, can you be
my number one helper?

145
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:17,890
Watch this. One hand.

146
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,063
Here we go.

147
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,133
Did you know that all
the best chefs are men?

148
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,498
Isn't this terrific?
We gotta do this more often.

149
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,230
- You dropped some shell in it.
- That's okay.

150
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:33,078
Makes it crunchier.
You like it crunchy, don't you?

151
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,147
Why don't you beat them,
and I'll get everything else going.

152
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,350
- What time is school?
- 8:30.

153
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,782
Gotta get the show on the road.
I gotta shower, shave and shampoo.

154
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,149
I got people to see.

155
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,917
And Daddy's gotta bring home
the bacon...

156
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,627
...and he's gotta cook it.

157
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,021
We're having a good time!
Where does Mommy keep the..?

158
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,626
- In the stove.
- The pan. The stove.

159
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,497
First, we need a nice fire.

160
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,432
No, you're not doing it right.

161
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,111
Look, you gotta do it fast. See?
It's the wrist.

162
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,210
So the gucky part dissolves.

163
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,281
Then you take the bread, and we...

164
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,179
We...

165
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,283
We fold the French toast.
That's what we do.

166
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:22,016
- I think you forgot milk.
- I didn't. Milk comes last.

167
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,957
When you're having a good time
you forget things.

168
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,896
I just wanted to see
if you're paying attention.

169
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,894
Fun, isn't it? When's the last
time Mommy let you in the kitchen?

170
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,639
I don't like it in pieces.

171
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,971
It tastes the same whether it's in
pieces or whole. Bread is bread.

172
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,644
Besides, French toast
is always folded.

173
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,079
In the best restaurants,
you see folded French toast.

174
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,249
You get more bites that way.

175
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:53,320
And while that's going,
Daddy's gonna make coffee.

176
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,150
You having a good time?

177
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,990
I don't remember the last
time I had such a good time.

178
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,764
Daddy's gonna make himself coffee.

179
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,434
- That's too much!
- No, I like it strong.

180
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,830
Mommy always makes it too weak.

181
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,009
Can I have some orange juice?

182
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,176
Right. One OJ coming up
for the kid.

183
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,115
Daddy, it's burning!

184
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,578
- What?
- It's burning!

185
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,513
Damn it! Goddamn her!

186
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,424
Oh, shit.

187
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,398
Just take it easy.
Everything is fine. We're terrific.

188
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,102
Just...

189
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,702
Just take it easy.
Nothing is the matter.

190
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,811
- What?
- Your hand's sweaty.

191
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,605
- When's Mommy coming back?
- Soon. I told you.

192
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,216
- Is she gonna pick me up?
- Probably. If she doesn't, I will.

193
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,318
- What if you forget?
- I won't.

194
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:59,887
- What if you get run over?
- Mommy will pick you up.

195
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,286
- Miss! What grade are you in?
- First.

196
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,054
This is Billy Kramer.
He's in first grade.

197
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,664
Take care of him. I gotta
get a taxi, I'm late. Taxi!

198
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,901
Taxi!

199
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,505
- Congratulations about Mid-Atlantic.
- Thanks.

200
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:19,175
- Congratulations.
- Is the stuff back from the retoucher?

201
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,743
- Great news, Ted.
- Thanks a lot.

202
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,449
Morning. 11:00, meeting
with Airwick...

203
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,948
- Where's the stuff from the retoucher?
- Right here.

204
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,019
- Did my wife call?
- No.

205
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,588
You're gonna have to cancel
the Airwick at 11:30.

206
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,021
She's never gone this far before,
but in the past...

207
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,126
...I've known
when she's upset because...

208
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,024
...she gets very quiet.

209
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,825
Our pattern has been that I've said,
"What's the matter?"...

210
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,901
...and she'll kind of sit on it.

211
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,230
But in the last few weeks,
maybe couple of months...

212
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:26,410
...since we've been going crazy
with this account, I've been remiss.

213
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:32,014
And I just didn't look at the writing
on the wall, so she's kind of...

214
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:36,146
I think this is a way
of making me stop, look and say:

215
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,515
"I'm as important as your work."

216
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,851
Is there another guy?

217
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,593
I don't think so.
She's not the type.

218
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,733
She's got this friend, Margaret,
downstairs...

219
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:55,737
...you know, women's lib.
I think they may have cooked this up.

220
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,833
It worked.

221
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,611
I'm going crazy!

222
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,041
Look, not to worry.

223
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,840
She'll be back.

224
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,416
I didn't know it would happen to me!

225
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,944
Don't let it get you down.

226
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:13,625
I know she'll be back.
I'm terrific, really.

227
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,095
- You do have a problem, Ted.
- Yeah, what's that?

228
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,901
What are you gonna do about Billy?

229
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:29,596
This just happened last night.
I'm sure when Joanna comes back...

230
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,070
It's none of my business.
I'll butt out.

231
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,905
Listen, I want to hear your thoughts.

232
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:38,310
I appreciate you
taking the time to talk to me.

233
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:43,147
May sound a little rough, but...

234
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:47,654
...I think you ought to send Billy away
to stay with relatives for a while.

235
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,618
You mean, until Joanna comes back?

236
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,728
Suppose Joanna doesn't come back?

237
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,731
Gee, I don't know...

238
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,495
Ted, listen to me.

239
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:06,074
I just told the boys upstairs you're
handling the Mid-Atlantic account.

240
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:10,840
You know? A gig like that comes
along once every five, six years.

241
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,416
There's guys here eating their hearts
out because I gave that spot to you.

242
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:19,022
This is important. Don't blow this.

243
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,091
I gotta depend on you. I gotta count
on you for 110 percent...

244
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:27,690
...7 days a week, 24 hours a day.
I gotta have that.

245
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,436
I can't be concerned about you
worrying about a kid.

246
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,638
First, you can count on me
25 hours a day, 8 days a week.

247
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,706
Because I'm not a loser, Jim.

248
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,843
I never let anything at home
come into the office.

249
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,377
You asked me to unload in this office.

250
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,312
When I go outside, I'm on top of it.
I want you to know that.

251
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,987
I'm a survivor.

252
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,023
You've given me a shot here.
I'm not gonna let anything blow it.

253
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,892
Okay?

254
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:02,132
Let's have a drink later.
I'm all right. I gotta...

255
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,665
...blow smoke up Airwick's ass, 11:00.

256
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,531
I'm all right!

257
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,205
You don't worry.

258
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,806
Thank you.

259
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,970
I love you, you bastard.

260
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:20,512
Daddy?

261
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,549
Daddy?

262
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,421
Yeah, honey, just wait a second.
I just want to finish this idea.

263
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,425
Let me get this copy done,
and then I'll talk.

264
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,997
What time is it when an elephant
sits on your fence?

265
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,498
Time to get a new fence.

266
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,604
Honey, please...
I just got this sentence.

267
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,274
Daddy! Daddy!

268
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,512
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

269
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,947
Get over there and sit
on that couch and don't move!

270
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,881
I knew this was gonna happen!
I knew it!

271
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:00,683
Who told you not to drink
this stuff here?

272
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,860
- Sorry.
- Yeah, you're sorry.

273
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,757
Told you to keep that juice
in the dining room!

274
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,792
Sorry.

275
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,897
Who took you to the park, gave you
everything you wanted?

276
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,367
- Who bought you an ice cream?
- You.

277
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,599
And who promised Daddy that when
we got home, you'd let him work?

278
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,242
- That's ruined. I can't fix that.
- Sorry.

279
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,052
It's past your bedtime.
Why don't you go to sleep?

280
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,323
And brush your teeth
and flush the toilet.

281
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,739
- Paper towels. What else?
- We need detergent.

282
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:49,998
All right.

283
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,507
No, Mommy buys the kind
with the orange circles on it.

284
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,771
- There's no difference.
- Mom said it was the best.

285
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,318
- Let's go.
- Get the pink stuff.

286
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:06,921
All right, come on.

287
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,753
Okay. That's it.

288
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,922
We need some cereal.

289
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,360
Okay, what color?

290
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,476
Hey, Billy!

291
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,137
Billy! Told you Mommy would write
before the week was up.

292
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,386
- When is she coming back?
- That's what we're gonna find out now.

293
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:39,151
Okay. Let's read it.

294
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,693
"My dearest, sweet Billy."

295
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,860
That's you.

296
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,231
"Mommy has gone away.

297
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,976
Sometimes in the world...

298
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,508
...daddies go away...

299
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:03,372
...and mommies bring up
their little boys.

300
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,515
But sometimes, a mommy
can go away too...

301
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,846
...and you have your daddy
to bring you up.

302
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,419
I have gone away
because I must find...

303
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:16,525
...something interesting to do
for myself in the world.

304
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,424
Everybody has to, and so do I.

305
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:27,931
Being your mommy was one thing,
but there are other things too...

306
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:31,198
...and this is what I have to do.

307
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,844
I did not get a chance
to tell you this...

308
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,842
...and that is why
I'm writing you now.

309
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,607
I will always be your mommy...

310
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:43,619
...and I will always love you.

311
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,847
I just won't be your mommy
in the house...

312
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:49,618
...but I'll be your mommy
at the heart.

313
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:54,130
And now I must go
and be the person I have to be."

314
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,296
We'll read this another time.

315
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,973
I don't care.

316
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,346
- Good night, Jim.
- Come on in.

317
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,876
- Have a drink.
- I can't, I'm late now.

318
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:22,848
What's the rush? We're having
a party for Norman. Five years here.

319
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,146
Can you believe it?

320
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:27,153
Wish I could, but I'm late.
I gotta pick up Billy.

321
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,327
You know Jerry Hoover, in media?

322
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,453
Tell you something funny.

323
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,290
Gotta go. See you Monday.

324
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,197
Taxi!

325
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,562
Taxi!

326
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,304
- Here, keep the change.
- Thanks.

327
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,927
Hi, Mrs. Kline. I'm sorry I'm late.

328
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,668
That's all right, but Billy is upset.

329
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,361
Hey, how's it going, sport?

330
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,773
I had a little trouble
getting away from the office.

331
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,671
Sorry. Come on, let's get going.

332
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,540
Thanks for coming, Billy.
Oh, wait a minute.

333
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,719
- Don't forget your goody bag.
- Thanks very much.

334
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,612
- Bye.
- Thanks a lot.

335
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:34,416
- So, did you have a lot of fun?
- You're late.

336
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:37,424
- I'm not that late. Only 20 minutes.
- Want to bet?

337
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,730
All the other mothers were there
before you.

338
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,296
Why are you making such a big deal
of it? There was traffic.

339
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:54,537
If you want to be a big boy...

340
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,715
...you learn that when somebody says
they're sorry...

341
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:04,116
...you don't hold a grudge
and make them feel bad for...

342
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,324
...a long time afterwards.

343
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,220
Okay, go ahead.

344
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:15,161
Don't eat with your fingers.
Come on, Billy.

345
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,597
You know better than that.
Here.

346
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,304
Use a fork.

347
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:26,109
Come on, come on.
Sit up, sit up, sit up.

348
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,809
How was school today?

349
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,979
Same as usual.

350
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,412
I see the Knicks finally won a game.

351
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,482
I don't care.

352
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,279
What do you mean?

353
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:40,514
- I like Boston.
- Boston? Why do you like Boston?

354
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,187
Because Mommy's from Boston.

355
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,790
Sit up and try to eat. Come on.

356
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:53,027
Can I be excused?
I want to go to bed.

357
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:54,669
Too much birthday cake?

358
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,534
Yeah, I guess.

359
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,758
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

360
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,356
Louise, give me a hand.

361
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,959
You're 15 minutes late.

362
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,730
- Mr. O'Connor is very upset.
- This all of it?

363
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:18,061
- Yes. Do you want your mail now?
- No, just give me the messages.

364
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:21,704
Remind me to get
a Crying Chrissie doll at lunch.

365
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,271
Okay, okay.

366
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,405
Sorry I'm late.

367
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:28,907
And there's a PTA meeting
at the school on Tuesday at 4.

368
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:32,913
Right, thanks.

369
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,813
Put the chicken in the refrigerator.

370
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,885
Know who Charley's seeing now?

371
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,113
Who?

372
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:45,624
A divorced woman with two little girls
the same age as Kim and Petey.

373
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,762
- Are you kidding?
- No.

374
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,057
How do you know?

375
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,132
I know.

376
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:54,237
How long has it been since
you two broke up?

377
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,406
Year and a half.

378
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,801
That long?

379
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,134
Did I ever tell you how sorry...

380
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:03,439
...how sad Joanna and I were
when you guys split?

381
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:07,907
Look at that cute little boy
over there.

382
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,417
You think you'll ever
get married again?

383
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,258
- I mean, to anybody.
- No.

384
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,858
Why?

385
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:21,855
Maybe it's different if you don't
have children, but...

386
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:27,631
...even if Charley and I aren't living
together, and even if we're...

387
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:32,935
...sleeping with other people, even
if he were to get married again...

388
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,839
...he's still my husband...

389
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:39,174
...and he's still the father of my
children and...

390
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:45,055
That stuff about "till death do you
part," that's really true.

391
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,951
Let's say Charley finishes
his midlife crisis...

392
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,153
...he's had it with his flings
and comes asking for forgiveness.

393
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,025
What would you do?

394
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:04,131
I think that if he really loved me...

395
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,809
...he wouldn't have let me
divorce him.

396
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,184
You still think about him, don't you?

397
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,749
Only all the time.

398
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,535
- Think about Joanna?
- Never.

399
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,903
Liar.

400
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,268
Some pair, boy.

401
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,008
I don't believe it.

402
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,681
- You missed the closing.
- I'm sorry.

403
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:50,183
Look, I gotta tell you something.
I'm getting very nervous here.

404
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:53,551
Ever since your wife left you.
Is it eight months now?

405
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,554
You're not getting any better.

406
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:56,885
What do you mean?

407
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:02,395
Look, I can't let your family problems
interfere with my responsibilities.

408
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,862
I got a shop to run.

409
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:07,730
I regret it, and I promise you
it will never happen again.

410
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,266
Okay?

411
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,471
Yeah?

412
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,741
Yeah, wait a minute.

413
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:20,246
- It's for you, pick up 461.
- Who is it?

414
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,817
Pick up 461.

415
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,787
Yeah?

416
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,125
Oh, hi, Billy. What's up?

417
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:33,892
No, one hour of television a day.
That's the rule.

418
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,793
No.

419
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:40,503
I don't care what the other
mothers do, Billy. We made a deal.

420
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,898
I can't talk now. I'm busy.

421
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:47,507
We will talk about it tonight
when I get home, all right?

422
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:50,407
Double chocolate chip. I remember.

423
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,243
I'm getting very nervous.

424
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,322
Put that down and eat your dinner.

425
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,029
What is this crap?

426
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,129
- It's Salisbury steak.
- I hate it.

427
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,859
You had it last week and you loved it.

428
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:16,596
No, I didn't. I hate the brown
stuff. It's gross.

429
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:19,207
- It's onions and gravy.
- I'm allergic to onions.

430
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,876
You are not.
You had this last week...

431
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:26,149
...and I said it was my favorite and you
said, "It's my favorite too."

432
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,045
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

433
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,549
It's regular hamburger.

434
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,447
Take a bite. It's delicious.

435
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,514
What's the matter?

436
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,158
I'm gonna throw up.

437
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,522
- No, you're not.
- It's yucky.

438
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,665
It is not yucky, Billy. Eat it.

439
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:50,571
Did you bring the chocolate chip
ice cream home?

440
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,572
Yes, I brought the chocolate chip
ice cream home...

441
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,315
...and you can't have it until
you eat all your dinner...

442
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,414
Where are you going?
Get back here now.

443
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,051
Did you hear me?

444
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,515
You'd better not do that.

445
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:08,018
You'd better stop right there.
I'm warning you.

446
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,086
Did you hear me?

447
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,762
Now, you listen to me.
Don't be smart.

448
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,435
Put that back until you finish
your dinner.

449
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,276
If you take one bite out of that,
you're in trouble.

450
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:31,174
Don't you dare.
Don't you dare do that.

451
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,246
You hear me? Hold it right there.

452
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:38,487
You put that ice cream in your mouth
and you are in very big trouble.

453
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,987
Don't you dare go anywhere
beyond that. Put it down.

454
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:46,425
I am not going to say it again.
I am not going to say it again.

455
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:50,761
You're hurting me!

456
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,697
Don't you kick me.

457
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:56,502
- I hate you!
- You're no bargain either, pal.

458
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:59,005
You are a spoiled little brat!

459
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,007
- I hate you!
- I hate you back, you little shit!

460
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,714
- I want my mommy!
- I'm all you've got.

461
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,853
I want my mommy!

462
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,819
I want my mommy!

463
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,199
I want my mommy!

464
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,135
Mommy...

465
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:23,953
Daddy?

466
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:26,194
Daddy?

467
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,555
- Yeah?
- I'm sorry.

468
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,231
I'm sorry too.

469
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:37,302
I want you to go to sleep
because it's really late.

470
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,035
Daddy?

471
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:41,972
Now what is it?

472
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,246
Are you going away?

473
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,080
No.

474
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:50,220
I'm staying here with you.
You can't get rid of me that easy.

475
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:53,748
That's why Mommy left, isn't it?
Because I was bad?

476
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,158
Is that what you think?

477
00:39:58,896 --> 00:39:59,760
No.

478
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:05,261
That's not it, Billy.
Your mom loves you very much...

479
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:09,235
...and the reason she left has
nothing to do with you.

480
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:16,179
I don't know if this will make sense,
but I'll try to explain it to you.

481
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,108
I think the reason why Mommy left...

482
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,782
...was because for a long time...

483
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:30,152
...I kept trying to make her be
a certain kind of person.

484
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:35,921
A certain kind of wife that
I thought she was supposed to be.

485
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,261
And she just wasn't like that.
She was...

486
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,098
She just wasn't like that.

487
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:49,739
I think that she tried for so long
to make me happy...

488
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:53,972
...and when she couldn't,
she tried to talk to me about it.

489
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:58,952
But I wasn't listening.
I was too busy, too wrapped up...

490
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,420
...just thinking about myself.

491
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:06,596
And I thought that anytime
I was happy, she was happy.

492
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:11,029
But I think underneath
she was very sad.

493
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:14,864
Mommy stayed here
longer than she

494
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,473
wanted because she
loves you so much.

495
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:22,606
And the reason why Mommy
couldn't stay anymore...

496
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,179
...was because she couldn't stand me.

497
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,817
She didn't leave because of you.
She left because of me.

498
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:48,398
Go to sleep now because
it's really late, okay?

499
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,538
Good night.

500
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,538
- Sleep tight.
- Don't let the bedbugs bite.

501
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:56,337
See you in the morning light.

502
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,571
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

503
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:01,976
I love you.

504
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,712
I love you too.

505
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,908
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Ladies and gentlemen...

506
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,440
...welcome to our Halloween Pageant.

507
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,382
...welcome to our Halloween Pageant.

508
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:40,947
- With gruesome goblins.
- With gruesome goblins.

509
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,353
And ghostly ghosts.

510
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:47,390
And wicked witches
and spooky spooks.

511
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:03,246
Tom, you and I both know
it's a violation of privacy laws.

512
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:05,214
Tom, you and I both know
it's a violation of privacy laws.

513
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:09,408
Look, it doesn't make any difference.
It's name or likeness.

514
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,386
I don't care. Tell them if they
want it, they have to pay for it.

515
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,148
All right, bye-bye.

516
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:16,657
Hello, Kramer.

517
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,089
Can you check the copy
on Mid-Atlantic?

518
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:20,991
I think it's okay.

519
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:32,741
Yes.

520
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,276
Yes, what?

521
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,316
I'll have dinner with you.

522
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:48,583
Thank you.

523
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,783
You're welcome.

524
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,119
Oh, shit!

525
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,048
- I gotta go.
- What's the matter?

526
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:19,352
I gotta go.

527
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:22,650
- Want me to call a cab?
- No, I've got an 8:00 meeting.

528
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,418
- Where you going?
- Bathroom.

529
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:27,028
That's a closet.
Bathroom's over there.

530
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,189
Yeah, you're right.

531
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:34,368
These morons are violating the FTC
regulations, and I have to make sure...

532
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,735
Hi.

533
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:42,067
- What's your name?
- I'm Phyllis Bernard.

534
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:43,108
Who?

535
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:47,511
I'm a friend, uh, business associate
of your father's.

536
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:50,144
Oh, Jesus.

537
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:55,185
- Do you like fried chicken?
- Fried chicken? Very much.

538
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:56,516
So do I.

539
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,694
Well, it's really...

540
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,028
It's nice seeing you and...

541
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:06,429
- Bye.
- Bye.

542
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:12,742
Kramer, I just met your son.

543
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:17,412
Come on, you're never going to do
this if you don't concentrate.

544
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:22,850
All right, come on. Thattaboy.
Get your center.

545
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,748
Okay? How's it feel?

546
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:25,919
Good.

547
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:30,387
Keep it going, keep it going!
That's terrific!

548
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:34,129
Don't stop! Billy, keep your
feet moving!

549
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,431
Oh, that's terrific.
How do you feel?

550
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,794
- Good!
- You look great!

551
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,074
Don't go too far!

552
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:56,385
- Yeah?
- And so the dog really hurt Tom.

553
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,351
So Tom got so mad, he jumped in
the potato salad...

554
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:02,718
...and he pushed over the table.

555
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:03,824
Yeah?

556
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,755
- Then...
- Let me get your shoelace.

557
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,123
Then what happened?

558
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:11,768
The big dog kept chasing him,
then he flipped the table.

559
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:14,062
- With all the stuff coming down?
- Yeah.

560
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:15,403
Then what happened?

561
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,834
I don't want to be late for school.

562
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:20,076
Here's your homework. Give me a kiss.

563
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,142
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.

564
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,087
Taxi!

565
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,854
Hi.

566
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:47,636
Your babysitter answers,
wouldn't say where you were.

567
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,604
Your babysitter answers,
wouldn't say where you were.

568
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,365
Tell me where you were.

569
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:52,632
Well...

570
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:57,175
...my French professor finally
asked me out.

571
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,641
- When?
- The other day.

572
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:00,972
You had a date.

573
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,277
I knew you were keeping
something from me!

574
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,683
- I thought he was a pretty neat guy.
- Right.

575
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,719
- So we go to dinner.
- Yeah?

576
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,857
I find out he's married.

577
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,621
He's deep in analysis.

578
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:17,460
- He's telling me his life story...
- Wonderful!

579
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,228
...and all I can think of
while I sit there...

580
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,633
...is that I'm paying a babysitter
$3.25 an hour...

581
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:25,908
...to listen to his problems.

582
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,837
Daddy! Daddy, look!

583
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,172
- Take that out of your hand.
- I'll get him.

584
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,649
Did you hear me?

585
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:41,818
Hold it, hold it!

586
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,988
It hurts, Daddy.

587
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:50,758
- Daddy, hurry.
- Okay.

588
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,773
- I can't see, Daddy.
- Rest your head.

589
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,374
Watch it!

590
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:04,947
Daddy, please hurry.

591
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,642
- We're almost there.
- Can't see in my eye.

592
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:11,218
Let me see.
Where's the emergency room?!

593
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,296
How did this happen?

594
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,465
He fell off the jungle gym.

595
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:25,562
He had a plane in his hand.

596
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:27,064
I'm just about through.

597
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:29,238
- Don't hurt him.
- I won't hurt him.

598
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:32,237
Mr. Kramer, can I talk to you outside?

599
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:33,840
Yeah. Can she come in?

600
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:35,042
Margaret, come in.

601
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:37,575
- Stay, Daddy.
- I'll be right back.

602
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,681
- Daddy, stay.
- I'm just outside.

603
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:42,246
It's all right, darling.

604
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:44,019
I'm just talking to the doctor.

605
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:46,382
He'll be right back.

606
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,557
I'm right here.

607
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:49,817
Will he lose his eye?

608
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:53,485
No, but I have to take some stitches.

609
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:54,662
How many?

610
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,028
- About 10.
- What?

611
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,828
Don't worry. There won't be
much of a scar.

612
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,271
This will take about 15 minutes,
so step over here.

613
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:05,998
I want to be in there with him.

614
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,905
- You don't need to be in there.
- He's my son.

615
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:12,109
If you're gonna do something,
I'm gonna be with him.

616
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,348
Good boy. You're really brave.

617
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:27,730
That was a big one.

618
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,765
Stop it.

619
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:47,810
Okay, we're almost done now.
We're almost done now.

620
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:30,021
How is he?

621
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:33,453
He's okay. He's sleeping.

622
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:36,159
It's okay. I can do that.

623
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:40,998
Ted, I'm so sorry.
I feel responsible.

624
00:50:42,902 --> 00:50:44,392
I don't know what happened.

625
00:50:44,937 --> 00:50:48,566
One minute he was there and the
next he was lying on the ground.

626
00:50:49,675 --> 00:50:51,233
Come on, Margaret.

627
00:50:51,911 --> 00:50:54,778
Now listen, I want
to ask you a favor, okay?

628
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,913
It's a big favor.

629
00:50:58,251 --> 00:51:01,743
If something happened to me...
I'm not saying anything will...

630
00:51:01,988 --> 00:51:04,479
- but if a building fell on me...

631
00:51:04,924 --> 00:51:08,917
...would you consider
taking care of Billy?

632
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:16,726
I want you to know that I put
some thought into this...

633
00:51:16,936 --> 00:51:17,766
...and I...

634
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:21,638
...can't think of anybody else
I would trust with him.

635
00:51:22,308 --> 00:51:24,970
I know you'd be okay
with him because...

636
00:51:26,779 --> 00:51:28,508
...you're a good mother.

637
00:51:34,186 --> 00:51:36,211
You're a lousy dishwasher.

638
00:51:38,357 --> 00:51:40,348
- All right?
- Okay.

639
00:51:49,635 --> 00:51:51,227
You're all right.

640
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:07,719
Louise, you want to get that?

641
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:13,491
Louise, it's ringing...
Yeah, hello.

642
00:52:14,727 --> 00:52:16,251
Yes, who is this?

643
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:21,655
Joanna.

644
00:52:41,187 --> 00:52:42,051
Hi.

645
00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:44,954
- Hi.
- How are you?

646
00:52:45,191 --> 00:52:46,453
You look great.

647
00:52:48,628 --> 00:52:50,061
- How's your?
- What?

648
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:53,764
- I'm sorry.
- I was saying, how's your job?

649
00:52:54,066 --> 00:52:56,432
Fine. Vice president of nothing.

650
00:52:56,736 --> 00:52:57,930
No, really, it's great.

651
00:52:58,137 --> 00:53:00,469
- Would you like a drink?
- Whatever she has.

652
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:01,764
- White wine.
- Wine.

653
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:04,300
- How's Billy?
- He's terrific.

654
00:53:05,044 --> 00:53:08,741
He had a little accident in a
playground. He cut himself.

655
00:53:09,115 --> 00:53:11,948
It was scary.
I ran him to the hospital.

656
00:53:12,151 --> 00:53:14,483
He has a little scar,
but he'll be fine.

657
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,086
I've been worrying
that it's my fault...

658
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:20,621
Don't do that. You can't even
see it from a distance.

659
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:28,396
I sit in the coffee shop across
from his school and watch him.

660
00:53:28,601 --> 00:53:30,000
He got so big.

661
00:53:30,236 --> 00:53:31,635
You've been watching him?

662
00:53:31,904 --> 00:53:34,099
I've been in New York for
about two months now.

663
00:53:34,306 --> 00:53:35,500
I didn't know that.

664
00:53:36,308 --> 00:53:37,798
Anyway...

665
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:41,074
That's why I wanted
to talk to you today.

666
00:53:41,947 --> 00:53:46,816
Last time you saw me,
I was in pretty bad...

667
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,780
- Shaky?
- Really bad shape.

668
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:50,511
Yeah, I was.

669
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:51,921
I was.

670
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:55,119
Well, you look lovely now.

671
00:53:57,863 --> 00:53:59,854
- What?
- I have a whole speech.

672
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:01,599
Go ahead.

673
00:54:05,871 --> 00:54:08,169
All my life I've felt like...

674
00:54:08,374 --> 00:54:11,605
...somebody's wife or mother
or daughter.

675
00:54:11,844 --> 00:54:15,780
Even when we were together
I never knew who I was.

676
00:54:16,282 --> 00:54:17,715
That's why I had to go away.

677
00:54:18,217 --> 00:54:21,345
In California, I think I found myself.

678
00:54:21,554 --> 00:54:23,112
I got myself a job.

679
00:54:23,489 --> 00:54:26,390
I got myself a therapist,
a really good one.

680
00:54:27,727 --> 00:54:32,187
And I feel better about myself
than I ever have in my whole life.

681
00:54:32,398 --> 00:54:34,832
I learned a lot about myself.

682
00:54:36,168 --> 00:54:37,135
Such as?

683
00:54:39,238 --> 00:54:43,368
No, really, I'd really like to
know what you learned.

684
00:54:48,547 --> 00:54:52,540
I've learned
that I love my little boy.

685
00:54:53,853 --> 00:54:57,016
And that I'm capable of taking
care of him.

686
00:54:57,256 --> 00:54:58,746
What do you mean?

687
00:55:01,393 --> 00:55:02,485
I want my son.

688
00:55:03,395 --> 00:55:04,521
You can't have him.

689
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:07,094
Don't get defensive. Don't bully me.

690
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:08,698
I'm not getting defensive.

691
00:55:09,168 --> 00:55:10,829
Who walked out 15 months ago?

692
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:13,265
I don't care. I'm still his mother.

693
00:55:13,606 --> 00:55:14,834
From 3000 miles away.

694
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,237
Because you sent post cards gives
you the right to come back?

695
00:55:18,444 --> 00:55:20,241
I never stopped wanting him.

696
00:55:20,446 --> 00:55:22,073
What makes you sure he wants you?

697
00:55:22,515 --> 00:55:24,278
What makes you sure he doesn't?

698
00:55:25,785 --> 00:55:28,845
We're gonna sit here and
bat this back and forth.

699
00:55:29,054 --> 00:55:31,215
- It's like old times.
- You can't deny me...

700
00:55:31,524 --> 00:55:34,687
Don't tell me what I can or cannot do.

701
00:55:35,027 --> 00:55:38,292
- Don't talk to me that way.
- I anticipated this.

702
00:55:38,531 --> 00:55:40,829
Do what you have to.
I'll do what I have to.

703
00:55:41,066 --> 00:55:42,226
I'm sorry about this.

704
00:55:42,668 --> 00:55:44,329
Do what you have to do.

705
00:55:51,977 --> 00:55:55,674
I don't know the legal jargon for it,
but I think it's "desertion."

706
00:55:55,915 --> 00:56:01,080
I don't mean to tell you your job,
but I have an open-and-shut case.

707
00:56:01,353 --> 00:56:05,585
There's no such thing as an open-and-
shut case where custody is involved.

708
00:56:06,425 --> 00:56:09,258
I'll bet your ex-wife
has already found a lawyer...

709
00:56:09,495 --> 00:56:12,521
...who's advised her to move back
to establish residency.

710
00:56:12,765 --> 00:56:16,929
The burden is on us to prove
that your ex-wife is an unfit mother.

711
00:56:17,203 --> 00:56:20,695
That means I'll have to play rough.
If I play rough...

712
00:56:21,006 --> 00:56:24,237
...you can bet they will too.
Can you take that?

713
00:56:24,443 --> 00:56:25,432
Yes.

714
00:56:26,378 --> 00:56:28,539
And it's going to cost you $15,000.

715
00:56:30,416 --> 00:56:31,440
That's if we win.

716
00:56:31,784 --> 00:56:34,412
If we go to appeal,
it'll cost you more.

717
00:56:35,721 --> 00:56:36,710
I understand.

718
00:56:38,624 --> 00:56:40,717
Now, how old is the child again?

719
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:42,550
My son is 7.

720
00:56:42,795 --> 00:56:44,456
- That's tough.
- Why?

721
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:48,894
In cases involving a child that young,
the court tends to side with her.

722
00:56:49,134 --> 00:56:50,431
She signed over custody.

723
00:56:50,636 --> 00:56:54,265
I'm not saying we don't have a shot,
but it won't be easy.

724
00:56:54,573 --> 00:56:56,370
Do me a favor, will you?

725
00:56:56,609 --> 00:56:59,476
There's something I find useful
in matters like this.

726
00:56:59,778 --> 00:57:03,771
I sit down and I write out all
the pros and cons on an issue.

727
00:57:04,049 --> 00:57:05,573
Write them and look at them.

728
00:57:07,253 --> 00:57:09,380
<i>- I want you to do that, okay?
- Okay.</i>

729
00:57:09,622 --> 00:57:10,987
<i>And after that...</i>

730
00:57:11,223 --> 00:57:14,886
<i>... if you're really certain
you want to retain custody...</i>

731
00:57:15,094 --> 00:57:19,724
<i>... then we'll go in there
and beat the pants off them. Okay?</i>

732
00:57:38,517 --> 00:57:42,009
I love you, Billy. I know you're
sleeping and can't hear me.

733
00:57:42,321 --> 00:57:44,755
I love you with all my heart.

734
00:58:02,508 --> 00:58:04,100
Ted, you got a lunch?

735
00:58:04,443 --> 00:58:08,777
Hi, Jim. I don't know. I was trying
to work this idea out here...

736
00:58:08,981 --> 00:58:11,279
Good. I'll pick you up at 1:00.

737
00:58:12,651 --> 00:58:13,879
Okay, you got it.

738
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,689
So the other morning,
I'm at the refrigerator...

739
00:58:18,457 --> 00:58:20,687
...getting Billy ready for school.

740
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,396
I'm just in my underwear
and he notices I've lost weight.

741
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:27,121
He comes in and pats me.
He comes to here.

742
00:58:27,366 --> 00:58:31,234
And he says, "Daddy, you've really
lost a lot of weight."

743
00:58:31,503 --> 00:58:35,462
He looks up at me and he says,
"And it's all gone to your nose."

744
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:39,573
He was so cute. You know?

745
00:58:39,878 --> 00:58:40,810
You know, kids.

746
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,048
It's delicious, want a taste?

747
00:58:43,248 --> 00:58:44,977
- I'm full.
- It's good.

748
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,150
Listen, Ted...

749
00:58:47,353 --> 00:58:52,052
...I had a call from a friend
of mine over at another agency.

750
00:58:53,192 --> 00:58:56,719
The Mid-Atlantic people have
invited them to pitch the account.

751
00:58:56,929 --> 00:58:57,987
Why?

752
00:58:58,197 --> 00:59:00,665
They're not happy
with what we're doing.

753
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,392
I think you should have them over
and I'll give a little tap dance.

754
00:59:06,705 --> 00:59:08,570
I got Norman working on it.

755
00:59:08,841 --> 00:59:10,399
Norman?

756
00:59:13,379 --> 00:59:15,609
You taking me off the account?

757
00:59:17,683 --> 00:59:19,082
You don't like me anymore?

758
00:59:19,385 --> 00:59:21,250
It's not quite that simple.

759
00:59:24,056 --> 00:59:26,923
I think we're gonna have to
make a few changes here.

760
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,757
You're firing me?

761
00:59:34,466 --> 00:59:36,696
Yeah, I'm letting you go, yes.

762
00:59:40,105 --> 00:59:40,935
Why?

763
00:59:41,206 --> 00:59:44,471
Now, look, Ted, this is
a very painful thing for me.

764
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:48,771
I've been getting a lot of pressure
from the guys upstairs.

765
00:59:48,981 --> 00:59:50,915
There wasn't anything I could do.

766
00:59:51,116 --> 00:59:53,380
I think it's better this way.

767
00:59:53,585 --> 00:59:54,745
If I took your stripes...

768
00:59:54,987 --> 00:59:59,788
...if I put you on a schlock account,
you'd hate it, and me for doing it.

769
01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:02,926
This way it's a clean break.
That's the best thing.

770
01:00:03,295 --> 01:00:05,786
You know my wife is fighting
for custody?

771
01:00:06,065 --> 01:00:08,397
You know that we're going to court?

772
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:11,966
Do you know what my chances are
if I'm out of a job?

773
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:14,798
I understand that you're upset...

774
01:00:15,007 --> 01:00:18,807
I don't want to beg, but I'm
asking you, please, as a friend.

775
01:00:19,945 --> 01:00:21,310
I'm asking you.

776
01:00:21,513 --> 01:00:25,142
You're an extremely bright guy.
You've got a hell of a talent.

777
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:29,286
You're gonna land on your feet.
You're gonna survive.

778
01:00:29,521 --> 01:00:31,148
Teddy, look.

779
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:34,684
I know you may be short on cash.

780
01:00:34,927 --> 01:00:37,361
No big hurry about paying this back.

781
01:00:37,763 --> 01:00:39,458
Shame on you.

782
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,314
Daddy, the phone's ringing.

783
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,380
<i>- Mr. Kramer?
- Yes.</i>

784
01:01:36,588 --> 01:01:38,715
<i>- Hold on for Mr. Shaunessy.
- Ted.</i>

785
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:40,583
John. What's happening?

786
01:01:40,859 --> 01:01:44,693
They set the court date.
I just heard today it's January 9th.

787
01:01:44,897 --> 01:01:48,731
I gotta tell you something.
I got fired today. They laid me off.

788
01:01:51,703 --> 01:01:54,695
Yeah, I'm still here.
Ted, I won't lie to you.

789
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:58,501
We don't have a hope of winning
if you're out of work.

790
01:01:59,611 --> 01:02:02,045
Yeah, listen, you tell that...

791
01:02:02,714 --> 01:02:05,842
You tell that party and you tell
that party's attorney...

792
01:02:06,084 --> 01:02:07,449
...that I want a delay.

793
01:02:07,686 --> 01:02:09,415
Sorry, it's really too late.

794
01:02:10,055 --> 01:02:12,523
<i>- Fine. I'll have a job in 24 hours.
- How?</i>

795
01:02:12,758 --> 01:02:14,692
I'll have a job in 24 hours.

796
01:02:44,423 --> 01:02:47,119
<i>This is the worst time
to look for work.</i>

797
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:50,953
It's the holidays. We'll have
something for you by mid-February.

798
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:53,460
- March, at the latest.
- I can't wait.

799
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:56,394
Mr. Kramer, it's December 22.

800
01:02:56,768 --> 01:02:59,328
If you could just look
in your card catalogue.

801
01:03:04,443 --> 01:03:06,274
I'll take anything.

802
01:03:09,348 --> 01:03:12,511
There might be something
at Norman, Craig and Kummel.

803
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:14,480
What is it?

804
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:16,414
Something in the art department.

805
01:03:16,655 --> 01:03:17,986
You'd go back on the board.

806
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:21,591
It's really a step down,
and a cut in salary of 5000.

807
01:03:21,793 --> 01:03:23,454
You'll be happier if you wait.

808
01:03:23,662 --> 01:03:27,621
Call them up, make an appointment
for me today at 4:00.

809
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:29,425
It's the Friday before Christmas.

810
01:03:29,668 --> 01:03:30,965
It's still a workday.

811
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:32,997
Nobody's gonna want to...

812
01:03:33,205 --> 01:03:34,934
Either you call them or I do.

813
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:38,439
If I call them up, you don't get
a commission. Right?

814
01:03:38,677 --> 01:03:40,872
My, we are a hotshot, aren't we?

815
01:03:43,215 --> 01:03:44,307
Yes, we are.

816
01:03:50,722 --> 01:03:54,021
- Good afternoon.
- I'm Kramer. I have an appointment.

817
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:57,152
I did all of the copy on that one.

818
01:04:00,232 --> 01:04:03,167
That was the most successful
ad campaign they ever had.

819
01:04:03,368 --> 01:04:06,963
I did the idea, the layout
and most of the copy on that one.

820
01:04:08,473 --> 01:04:11,567
Mr. Kramer, I must say,
this is very impressive.

821
01:04:12,144 --> 01:04:13,736
I'd like to get back to you.

822
01:04:14,012 --> 01:04:17,641
Is there someone I should see
before you come to your decision?

823
01:04:18,183 --> 01:04:20,151
Mr. Spencer, our creative director.

824
01:04:20,385 --> 01:04:22,376
Why don't you let me see him now?

825
01:04:23,088 --> 01:04:27,821
He's leaving on vacation. I'll set
something up the moment he gets back.

826
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:29,891
- I think...
- Have a nice holiday.

827
01:04:30,195 --> 01:04:32,823
I'd like to see him before he leaves.

828
01:04:33,932 --> 01:04:37,333
- Mr. Kramer, I don't...
- I want this position very much.

829
01:04:40,439 --> 01:04:41,428
Wait here.

830
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:13,897
Mr. Kramer, Mr. Spencer.

831
01:05:14,206 --> 01:05:16,197
- How do you do?
- You got 10 minutes.

832
01:05:19,144 --> 01:05:23,911
You do understand that the salary is
$4800 less than you were making?

833
01:05:24,216 --> 01:05:25,649
Yes, I understand.

834
01:05:25,884 --> 01:05:29,786
Why are you interested in a position
for which you're overqualified?

835
01:05:30,222 --> 01:05:31,280
I need the job.

836
01:05:32,124 --> 01:05:35,582
Let me think. I'll let Jack know
and he'll get in touch with you.

837
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:37,551
This is a one-day offer.

838
01:05:37,763 --> 01:05:40,994
You saw my book,
you know I can handle the work.

839
01:05:41,266 --> 01:05:43,461
You're gonna have
to let me know today,

840
01:05:43,635 --> 01:05:45,296
not at the end of the holidays.

841
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:48,300
If you want me,
make a decision right now.

842
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,580
Could we talk privately for a moment?

843
01:05:57,816 --> 01:05:58,976
Yes, sir.

844
01:06:45,363 --> 01:06:49,959
Mr. Kramer, you got yourself a job.
Congratulations.

845
01:06:50,202 --> 01:06:51,499
Really?

846
01:06:53,472 --> 01:06:55,497
- Is he kidding?
- Welcome aboard.

847
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:58,504
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thanks.

848
01:07:17,229 --> 01:07:18,594
Merry Christmas.

849
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:33,204
Come on.

850
01:07:37,716 --> 01:07:39,911
- What do you think?
- It's neat.

851
01:07:40,118 --> 01:07:42,518
- I told you.
- Where is everybody?

852
01:07:42,754 --> 01:07:47,384
It's Saturday, so very few people
come in because it's a day off.

853
01:07:47,859 --> 01:07:49,451
Okay, push "up."

854
01:07:52,898 --> 01:07:55,093
Push the top button.
Very top button.

855
01:07:55,367 --> 01:07:56,766
Go ahead, jump.

856
01:08:00,405 --> 01:08:01,633
- Look at that!
- Neat!

857
01:08:01,873 --> 01:08:03,272
You didn't know you were so high.

858
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:06,272
What building is that?
That has the pointy top.

859
01:08:06,545 --> 01:08:08,035
That's the Chrysler.

860
01:08:08,313 --> 01:08:10,110
You proud of me?

861
01:08:10,415 --> 01:08:11,609
How'd you get this job?

862
01:08:11,883 --> 01:08:14,909
I told them I wanted it.
What's that say?

863
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,144
It says "Kramer."

864
01:08:16,454 --> 01:08:18,422
Kramer. Who's that?

865
01:08:18,657 --> 01:08:20,591
- That's us.
- That's right.

866
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:22,225
You want to see?

867
01:08:23,962 --> 01:08:25,987
Wow!

868
01:08:27,165 --> 01:08:29,929
- This is neat.
- You like it?

869
01:08:30,502 --> 01:08:31,730
Careful, careful.

870
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:33,130
- I'm okay.
- Scare me.

871
01:08:33,338 --> 01:08:34,965
What's that building?

872
01:08:35,173 --> 01:08:37,903
That's the U.N. Building.
That's the East River.

873
01:08:38,143 --> 01:08:40,008
Look across there. You see that?

874
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:42,907
That's Queens.
Look way, way down there.

875
01:08:43,148 --> 01:08:44,581
- Know what that is?
- What?

876
01:08:44,783 --> 01:08:47,479
- Brooklyn.
- Where you lived when you were a kid?

877
01:08:47,786 --> 01:08:50,584
That's right,
and this is where I work.

878
01:08:52,757 --> 01:08:54,748
Is this really your desk?

879
01:08:57,929 --> 01:08:59,760
Are you gonna get remarried?

880
01:08:59,965 --> 01:09:02,024
I hadn't thought about it.

881
01:09:02,534 --> 01:09:04,593
Are you gonna marry Phyllis?

882
01:09:04,803 --> 01:09:06,828
No, we're just good friends.

883
01:09:10,642 --> 01:09:13,304
Are you and Mom ever
gonna get remarried?

884
01:09:14,212 --> 01:09:16,840
No, Mommy and me will never
be remarried.

885
01:09:17,349 --> 01:09:20,614
I bet if she saw this,
she'd remarry you.

886
01:09:23,855 --> 01:09:26,050
You're a con artist. We made a deal.

887
01:09:26,358 --> 01:09:28,383
You take a bath every night...

888
01:09:28,627 --> 01:09:31,687
...and you wash that filthy hair
twice a week, right?

889
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:32,960
- Right?
- Yeah.

890
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:34,460
Okay.

891
01:09:34,699 --> 01:09:36,030
Promise, or you're not going.

892
01:09:36,534 --> 01:09:39,196
Did I have to
when Mommy was here?

893
01:09:39,471 --> 01:09:42,133
I don't care what you had
to do when Mommy...

894
01:09:43,908 --> 01:09:47,139
Did I, Dad? Did I?

895
01:09:49,247 --> 01:09:50,509
Are you listening?

896
01:09:50,715 --> 01:09:53,548
We'll talk about it tonight
when I get home, okay?

897
01:09:53,752 --> 01:09:55,413
Come here, give me a kiss.

898
01:09:56,488 --> 01:09:58,820
- What?
- You're a terrific kid.

899
01:10:05,096 --> 01:10:06,927
He says, "There's the unicorn."

900
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:09,860
And he goes underneath there,
and he says:

901
01:10:10,101 --> 01:10:12,331
"Crumbs, what's happening?

902
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:14,197
The air supply has stopped.

903
01:10:14,506 --> 01:10:17,031
Thundering typhoons,
what are you doing?"

904
01:10:17,275 --> 01:10:19,607
"Resting. It's tiring work,
you know."

905
01:10:19,844 --> 01:10:21,334
What's the air supply?

906
01:10:21,579 --> 01:10:25,037
When you got two tanks on your back
and you can't get any air...

907
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,445
...you can drown,
so he's gotta have that.

908
01:10:27,752 --> 01:10:28,946
<i>Ted, John Shaunessy.</i>

909
01:10:29,187 --> 01:10:30,211
Hi, what's up?

910
01:10:30,422 --> 01:10:34,620
<i>I got a call from your wife's lawyer.
She wants to see the kid.</i>

911
01:10:35,026 --> 01:10:37,392
- She wants what?
- She's the mother.

912
01:10:37,595 --> 01:10:39,688
She's within her legal rights.

913
01:10:39,931 --> 01:10:44,129
<i>- How do I know she won't kidnap him?
- I don't think she'd bother...</i>

914
01:10:44,436 --> 01:10:46,700
...suing if she's gonna kidnap him.

915
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:50,306
Wait. I'm not so sure
about her mental health.

916
01:10:50,575 --> 01:10:53,874
<i>- What do you mean?
- She said she was seeing a shrink.</i>

917
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:55,103
A psychiatrist.

918
01:10:55,313 --> 01:10:56,746
Did you see her talk to walls?

919
01:10:56,948 --> 01:10:58,540
<i>I'm just saying, you know.</i>

920
01:10:58,783 --> 01:11:01,149
I'm just saying you don't
have a choice.

921
01:11:01,419 --> 01:11:04,752
Have Billy at the boat pond
in Central Park, Saturday at 10.

922
01:11:04,989 --> 01:11:07,116
<i>- Do I have to?
- Yes.</i>

923
01:11:08,226 --> 01:11:09,659
Thanks very much.

924
01:11:10,929 --> 01:11:14,262
Daddy, will you come on
and finish the story?

925
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,595
Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

926
01:11:21,339 --> 01:11:24,672
What happens if the guy drowns?
How do they find him?

927
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:28,743
When you die, there's bubbles
that come up or something.

928
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,242
Where did I leave off?

929
01:11:30,515 --> 01:11:33,006
You left off right there.

930
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:34,843
"Thundering typhoons..."

931
01:11:37,589 --> 01:11:39,750
It's got an obstacle course and stuff.

932
01:11:39,991 --> 01:11:42,186
- The cars go really fast.
- How much?

933
01:11:42,427 --> 01:11:43,519
It's really neat.

934
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:45,195
It's neat.

935
01:11:45,964 --> 01:11:48,660
- Come here, I want you to look...
- Okay, okay.

936
01:12:04,048 --> 01:12:06,380
I'll have him back by 6.

937
01:12:07,385 --> 01:12:08,716
You got so handsome.

938
01:13:05,243 --> 01:13:09,680
Remember, we talked about it,
keep your answers short and succinct.

939
01:13:09,914 --> 01:13:13,350
Just tell the truth and it'll be
all right. Believe me.

940
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,514
- She's here.
- Yeah, I know. I saw her.

941
01:13:18,756 --> 01:13:22,556
Whatever you do, try not to become
emotional, no matter what he says.

942
01:13:22,794 --> 01:13:26,389
You'll hear things that may upset you.
I don't want you to react.

943
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:30,961
Persons having business with the
Supreme Court, State of New York...

944
01:13:31,269 --> 01:13:34,636
...special term part five,
draw nigh and ye shall be heard.

945
01:13:34,873 --> 01:13:39,606
This court is now in session.
Judge Atkins presiding. All rise.

946
01:13:56,561 --> 01:14:00,088
- Is the petitioner's attorney ready?
- I am, Your Honor.

947
01:14:00,331 --> 01:14:02,458
I would like to call Joanna Kramer.

948
01:14:02,767 --> 01:14:04,462
Motherhood, going for the throat.

949
01:14:04,769 --> 01:14:07,636
You swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

950
01:14:07,906 --> 01:14:09,237
I do.

951
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:19,678
Now, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell
the court how long you were married?

952
01:14:19,951 --> 01:14:21,111
Eight years.

953
01:14:21,419 --> 01:14:24,684
And would you describe those years
as happy?

954
01:14:25,023 --> 01:14:27,116
The first two, yes.

955
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:30,950
But after that it became
increasingly difficult.

956
01:14:31,829 --> 01:14:36,198
Mrs. Kramer, did you hold a job
before you were married?

957
01:14:36,434 --> 01:14:39,926
Yes, I did.
When I first got out of Smith...

958
01:14:40,204 --> 01:14:45,198
<i>...I worked in the art department of
Mademoiselle magazine for years.</i>

959
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:49,671
Did you continue to work
after you were married?

960
01:14:49,881 --> 01:14:52,008
No. I did not.

961
01:14:52,283 --> 01:14:53,682
Did you wish to?

962
01:14:53,885 --> 01:14:58,879
Yes, but every time I talked to Ted...

963
01:14:59,123 --> 01:15:03,856
To my ex-husband about it,
he wouldn't listen.

964
01:15:04,162 --> 01:15:08,656
He refused to discuss it
in any serious way.

965
01:15:09,033 --> 01:15:11,593
He said that I
probably couldn't get a job...

966
01:15:11,803 --> 01:15:14,397
...that would pay enough
to hire a babysitter.

967
01:15:14,706 --> 01:15:17,641
Tell me, are you employed
at the present time?

968
01:15:17,909 --> 01:15:20,377
I'm a sportswear designer
here in New York.

969
01:15:20,645 --> 01:15:23,136
And what is your present salary?

970
01:15:23,348 --> 01:15:25,976
I make $31,000 a year.

971
01:15:26,384 --> 01:15:29,911
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?

972
01:15:30,989 --> 01:15:33,253
Yes, I do, very much.

973
01:15:33,558 --> 01:15:36,391
And yet you chose to leave him.

974
01:15:37,328 --> 01:15:38,727
Yes.

975
01:15:44,936 --> 01:15:48,497
During the last five years
of our marriage...

976
01:15:50,241 --> 01:15:52,766
...I was becoming more
and more unhappy.

977
01:15:53,444 --> 01:15:54,877
More and more troubled.

978
01:15:55,113 --> 01:15:59,106
And I really needed
somebody to help me...

979
01:15:59,417 --> 01:16:02,443
...but when I turned to Ted, he just...

980
01:16:03,521 --> 01:16:05,614
...wasn't there for me.

981
01:16:06,224 --> 01:16:09,022
So we became more isolated
from one another...

982
01:16:09,227 --> 01:16:11,058
...more and more separate.

983
01:16:11,729 --> 01:16:14,357
He was very involved in his career.

984
01:16:15,466 --> 01:16:19,596
And because of his attitude
towards my fears...

985
01:16:19,871 --> 01:16:23,307
...and his inability
to deal with my feelings...

986
01:16:24,542 --> 01:16:26,976
...I had come to have
almost no self-esteem.

987
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:31,209
I was scared and I was very unhappy.

988
01:16:31,449 --> 01:16:33,917
In my mind I had no choice
but to leave.

989
01:16:35,787 --> 01:16:40,622
At the time I left, I felt that
there was something wrong with me...

990
01:16:41,125 --> 01:16:43,958
...and that my son would be
better off without me.

991
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:50,064
And it was only after I got
to California that I realized...

992
01:16:50,301 --> 01:16:54,397
...after getting into therapy,
that I wasn't a terrible person.

993
01:16:57,141 --> 01:17:01,669
And just because I needed some kind
of creative or emotional outlet...

994
01:17:01,946 --> 01:17:05,177
...other than my child,
that didn't make me unfit.

995
01:17:06,084 --> 01:17:10,020
I would like to submit in evidence
a report by Mrs. Kramer's therapist...

996
01:17:10,288 --> 01:17:11,778
...Dr. Eleanor Freedman.

997
01:17:11,989 --> 01:17:13,149
Objection, Your Honor.

998
01:17:13,424 --> 01:17:16,916
The report is irrelevant
and not binding on the respondent.

999
01:17:17,195 --> 01:17:18,253
Overruled.

1000
01:17:19,764 --> 01:17:23,359
Can you tell the court why
you are asking for custody?

1001
01:17:25,203 --> 01:17:27,330
Because he's my child...

1002
01:17:27,805 --> 01:17:30,171
...and because I love him.

1003
01:17:31,676 --> 01:17:33,803
I know I left my son.

1004
01:17:35,146 --> 01:17:37,979
I know that
that's a terrible thing to do.

1005
01:17:41,519 --> 01:17:45,046
Believe me, I have to live with that
every day of my life.

1006
01:17:45,623 --> 01:17:47,784
But in order to leave him...

1007
01:17:48,459 --> 01:17:51,724
...I had to believe it was
the only thing I could do...

1008
01:17:53,664 --> 01:17:55,962
...and that it was
the best thing for him.

1009
01:17:56,234 --> 01:17:58,862
I was incapable of functioning
in that home.

1010
01:17:59,137 --> 01:18:01,128
And I didn't know...

1011
01:18:01,339 --> 01:18:03,637
...what the alternative was...

1012
01:18:03,841 --> 01:18:07,072
...so I thought it was not best
that I take him with me.

1013
01:18:07,345 --> 01:18:10,974
However, I have since
gotten some help...

1014
01:18:11,215 --> 01:18:15,709
...and I have worked very, very hard
to become a whole human being.

1015
01:18:18,489 --> 01:18:21,151
I don't think I should be
punished for that.

1016
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:25,728
I don't think my little boy
should be punished.

1017
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:28,494
Billy's only 7 years old.

1018
01:18:29,367 --> 01:18:30,925
He needs me.

1019
01:18:31,869 --> 01:18:34,702
I'm not saying he doesn't
need his father...

1020
01:18:36,007 --> 01:18:38,669
...but I really believe
he needs me more.

1021
01:18:40,545 --> 01:18:44,948
I was his mommy
for five and a half years...

1022
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:49,911
...and Ted took over that role
for 18 months.

1023
01:18:54,258 --> 01:18:57,125
But I don't know how anybody
can possibly believe...

1024
01:18:57,395 --> 01:19:01,422
...that I have less of a stake
in mothering that little boy...

1025
01:19:01,732 --> 01:19:03,893
...than Mr. Kramer does.

1026
01:19:07,305 --> 01:19:08,932
I'm his mother.

1027
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:13,070
I'm his mother.

1028
01:19:18,482 --> 01:19:19,540
Thank you, Mrs. Kramer.

1029
01:19:19,951 --> 01:19:22,044
I have no further questions.

1030
01:19:24,121 --> 01:19:26,612
Now then, Mrs. Kramer...

1031
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:32,054
...you say that you were married
for eight years, is that correct?

1032
01:19:34,165 --> 01:19:39,296
In all that time did your husband ever
strike you or physically abuse you?

1033
01:19:40,504 --> 01:19:41,732
No.

1034
01:19:41,939 --> 01:19:46,842
Did he ever strike or physically
abuse his child in any way?

1035
01:19:48,346 --> 01:19:51,440
Would you describe your husband
as an alcoholic?

1036
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:54,340
A heavy drinker?

1037
01:19:55,286 --> 01:19:57,117
Was he unfaithful?

1038
01:20:04,495 --> 01:20:07,487
Did he ever fail
to provide for you in any way?

1039
01:20:10,001 --> 01:20:12,469
I can certainly see why you left him.

1040
01:20:12,703 --> 01:20:14,170
Objection.

1041
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:19,375
How long do you plan to live
in New York, Mrs. Kramer?

1042
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:21,300
Permanently.

1043
01:20:23,047 --> 01:20:25,948
How many boyfriends have you had,
permanently?

1044
01:20:26,183 --> 01:20:28,447
Objection on grounds of vagueness.

1045
01:20:28,653 --> 01:20:30,018
I'll allow it.

1046
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:35,216
I don't recall.

1047
01:20:35,693 --> 01:20:38,161
More than three, less than 33,
permanently?

1048
01:20:38,396 --> 01:20:39,727
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1049
01:20:39,997 --> 01:20:42,158
The witness will answer, please.

1050
01:20:44,235 --> 01:20:45,896
Somewhere in between.

1051
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:47,728
Do you have a lover now?

1052
01:20:51,742 --> 01:20:55,508
Your Honor, I would request a direct
answer to a direct question.

1053
01:20:55,746 --> 01:20:57,543
Does she have a lover?

1054
01:20:57,848 --> 01:21:01,511
I'll allow that.
The witness will answer, please.

1055
01:21:03,254 --> 01:21:05,484
Yes, I'm seeing someone now.

1056
01:21:05,756 --> 01:21:08,486
Is that... permanent?

1057
01:21:10,328 --> 01:21:11,386
I don't know.

1058
01:21:11,595 --> 01:21:14,155
We don't know
when you say permanently...

1059
01:21:14,432 --> 01:21:18,698
...if you plan to live in New York,
or keep your child, for that matter...

1060
01:21:18,903 --> 01:21:23,704
...since you've never done anything
that could be regarded as permanent.

1061
01:21:23,908 --> 01:21:28,277
Objection. I request the counsel be
prevented from harassing the witness.

1062
01:21:28,546 --> 01:21:29,740
Sustained.

1063
01:21:30,014 --> 01:21:32,380
I'll put it another way, counselor.

1064
01:21:32,950 --> 01:21:36,681
What was the longest personal
relationship in your life...

1065
01:21:36,887 --> 01:21:39,515
...outside of parents or girlfriends?

1066
01:21:41,926 --> 01:21:43,621
I suppose that would be my child.

1067
01:21:44,295 --> 01:21:46,957
Whom you've seen twice in a year.

1068
01:21:47,198 --> 01:21:50,929
Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband...

1069
01:21:51,202 --> 01:21:54,899
...wasn't he the longest
personal relationship in your life?

1070
01:21:58,442 --> 01:22:00,740
Would you speak up?
I couldn't hear you.

1071
01:22:01,779 --> 01:22:03,041
Yes.

1072
01:22:03,547 --> 01:22:05,139
How long was that?

1073
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:09,915
We were married a year
before the baby...

1074
01:22:10,654 --> 01:22:12,121
...and seven years after.

1075
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:16,156
So you were a failure at the most
important relationship in your life.

1076
01:22:16,394 --> 01:22:18,055
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1077
01:22:18,262 --> 01:22:21,231
The witness's opinion on this
is relevant.

1078
01:22:22,099 --> 01:22:23,896
I was not a failure.

1079
01:22:24,568 --> 01:22:28,004
What do you call it, a success?
The marriage ended in divorce.

1080
01:22:28,572 --> 01:22:30,972
I consider it less my failure
than his.

1081
01:22:31,175 --> 01:22:32,733
Congratulations.

1082
01:22:32,943 --> 01:22:36,811
You've just rewritten matrimonial law.
You were both divorced.

1083
01:22:37,014 --> 01:22:38,504
Objection!

1084
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:42,842
Your Honor, I would like to ask
what this model of stability...

1085
01:22:43,154 --> 01:22:45,418
...and respectability
has ever succeeded at.

1086
01:22:46,023 --> 01:22:50,858
Were you a failure at the one most
important relationship in your life?

1087
01:22:53,097 --> 01:22:58,194
- It did not succeed.
- Not it, Mrs. Kramer, you.

1088
01:22:58,502 --> 01:23:02,996
Were you a failure at the one most
important relationship in your life?

1089
01:23:03,274 --> 01:23:04,764
Were you?!

1090
01:23:10,381 --> 01:23:11,643
<i>No.</i>

1091
01:23:17,021 --> 01:23:18,852
Is that a yes, Mrs. Kramer?

1092
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:28,127
No further questions.

1093
01:23:32,136 --> 01:23:35,071
- Did you have to be so rough?
- Do you want the kid?

1094
01:23:35,372 --> 01:23:36,634
Daddy?

1095
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:38,803
Daddy.

1096
01:23:39,143 --> 01:23:42,078
- Yeah?
- What did you do when you were little?

1097
01:23:42,313 --> 01:23:43,712
The same things you do.

1098
01:23:44,014 --> 01:23:46,414
<i>Did you watch The Brady Bunch?</i>

1099
01:23:47,017 --> 01:23:49,542
No, we didn't have any television.

1100
01:23:50,054 --> 01:23:51,646
You didn't?

1101
01:23:51,922 --> 01:23:53,651
We listened to the radio.

1102
01:23:53,891 --> 01:23:55,324
What else didn't you have?

1103
01:23:55,759 --> 01:23:57,522
We didn't have lots of things.

1104
01:23:57,728 --> 01:23:59,753
- Like?
- Like a lot of things.

1105
01:24:00,865 --> 01:24:01,923
What kind?

1106
01:24:05,002 --> 01:24:06,435
Come here.

1107
01:24:07,605 --> 01:24:09,232
We didn't have diet soda.

1108
01:24:09,507 --> 01:24:11,668
We had egg creams, which was
chocolate syrup...

1109
01:24:11,909 --> 01:24:14,377
...seltzer water and a bit of
milk and you went...

1110
01:24:14,778 --> 01:24:17,576
...and you drank it
and it was delicious.

1111
01:24:17,781 --> 01:24:20,272
We didn't have the Mets,
but we had the Brooklyn Dodgers.

1112
01:24:20,518 --> 01:24:23,453
We had the Polo Grounds
and Ebbets Field...

1113
01:24:23,687 --> 01:24:25,621
Boy, those were the days.

1114
01:24:25,856 --> 01:24:27,915
We didn't have the Volkswagens...

1115
01:24:28,125 --> 01:24:31,754
...but we had all those different cars
with funny names on them.

1116
01:24:31,962 --> 01:24:34,396
We didn't have Burger King
or McDonald's.

1117
01:24:34,698 --> 01:24:38,964
We had automats where you put a
quarter in and you'd get...

1118
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:42,762
...a piece of pie or a sandwich
you could see through a window.

1119
01:24:42,973 --> 01:24:45,942
We didn't have graffiti,
but we had this guy Kilroy...

1120
01:24:46,577 --> 01:24:48,807
<i>Mr. Kramer is a very devoted father.</i>

1121
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:51,877
<i>He spends a great deal of time
with Billy.</i>

1122
01:24:52,483 --> 01:24:54,075
He reads to Billy a lot.

1123
01:24:54,285 --> 01:24:57,948
They play together,
they talk all the time.

1124
01:24:58,789 --> 01:25:00,484
He's a wonderful father.

1125
01:25:00,758 --> 01:25:03,591
Thank you.
No further questions.

1126
01:25:03,827 --> 01:25:06,955
Mrs. Phelps, how long
have you known Joanna Kramer?

1127
01:25:07,331 --> 01:25:11,233
About six years, ever since she and
Ted moved into the building.

1128
01:25:11,468 --> 01:25:15,063
How often did you see
Joanna Kramer and her son?

1129
01:25:15,573 --> 01:25:19,805
I haven't seen them together now for
about a year and a half, but...

1130
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:23,173
...back then I saw them two or
three times a week.

1131
01:25:23,514 --> 01:25:26,108
My oldest daughter and Billy
play together.

1132
01:25:26,317 --> 01:25:30,481
Can you describe the relationship
between Joanna Kramer and her son?

1133
01:25:30,754 --> 01:25:31,516
It was good.

1134
01:25:32,189 --> 01:25:33,918
Joanna was a very good mother.

1135
01:25:34,158 --> 01:25:36,217
Both Ted and Joanna are very...

1136
01:25:36,427 --> 01:25:39,658
Did Mrs. Kramer discuss her
relationship with her ex-husband?

1137
01:25:40,431 --> 01:25:41,762
Yes.

1138
01:25:42,032 --> 01:25:44,865
Can you tell the court
exactly what she said?

1139
01:25:46,670 --> 01:25:48,831
Joanna wasn't happy
for many reasons...

1140
01:25:49,106 --> 01:25:53,634
Did you ever hear her say Mr. Kramer
was insensitive to his son's needs?

1141
01:25:57,648 --> 01:26:00,139
Would you answer the question?

1142
01:26:01,151 --> 01:26:03,676
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, but that was before...

1143
01:26:04,021 --> 01:26:06,615
Did you ever encourage
her to leave her husband?

1144
01:26:07,057 --> 01:26:08,388
No, I did not.

1145
01:26:11,195 --> 01:26:14,722
Several days before she left,
did you say to her:

1146
01:26:14,965 --> 01:26:19,061
"If you're in this much pain,
you owe it to yourself to leave"?

1147
01:26:20,838 --> 01:26:23,636
- I didn't think Joanna...
- Did you say to her:

1148
01:26:23,841 --> 01:26:27,174
"If you're in this much pain,
you owe it to yourself to leave"?

1149
01:26:28,512 --> 01:26:31,675
- Yes, but she was my friend...
- No further questions.

1150
01:26:33,050 --> 01:26:35,177
Mrs. Phelps, you may step down.

1151
01:26:35,419 --> 01:26:38,013
Joanna, things are not the same now.

1152
01:26:38,422 --> 01:26:39,855
Ted is not the same man.

1153
01:26:40,090 --> 01:26:42,888
- You don't know how hard he's tried...
- Mrs. Phelps!

1154
01:26:43,093 --> 01:26:44,993
They're beautiful together.

1155
01:26:45,229 --> 01:26:47,060
The witness is asked to step down.

1156
01:26:47,264 --> 01:26:49,164
If you could see them together...

1157
01:26:49,366 --> 01:26:51,266
...maybe you wouldn't be here now.

1158
01:26:51,502 --> 01:26:53,493
Mrs. Phelps, that will be all!

1159
01:26:59,176 --> 01:27:00,575
I'm sorry.

1160
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,411
When you were talking...

1161
01:27:05,215 --> 01:27:09,948
When my ex-wife was talking about how
unhappy she was during our marriage...

1162
01:27:10,187 --> 01:27:12,849
...most of what she said
was probably true.

1163
01:27:13,057 --> 01:27:15,355
There's a lot I didn't understand.

1164
01:27:16,093 --> 01:27:18,721
There's a lot
I'd do different if I could...

1165
01:27:19,096 --> 01:27:22,259
...just like there's a lot you wish
you could change but can't.

1166
01:27:22,466 --> 01:27:25,799
Some things, once they're done,
can't be undone.

1167
01:27:26,937 --> 01:27:28,564
My wife...

1168
01:27:28,906 --> 01:27:33,741
My ex-wife says she loves Billy
and I believe she does.

1169
01:27:34,578 --> 01:27:37,103
But I don't think
that's the issue here.

1170
01:27:38,148 --> 01:27:40,241
If I understand it correctly...

1171
01:27:41,118 --> 01:27:44,815
...what means the most here is
what's best for our son.

1172
01:27:45,322 --> 01:27:47,722
What's best for Billy.

1173
01:27:48,792 --> 01:27:50,657
My wife used to say to me:

1174
01:27:50,894 --> 01:27:54,125
"Why can't a woman have
the same ambitions as a man?"

1175
01:27:54,665 --> 01:27:56,257
I think you're right.

1176
01:27:56,567 --> 01:27:58,797
And maybe I've learned that much.

1177
01:27:59,002 --> 01:28:01,402
By the same token, I'd like to know...

1178
01:28:01,638 --> 01:28:06,598
...what law says a woman is a better
parent simply by virtue of her sex?

1179
01:28:07,411 --> 01:28:10,574
I've had time to think about
what makes a good parent.

1180
01:28:10,848 --> 01:28:13,749
It has to do with constancy.
It has to do with patience...

1181
01:28:13,951 --> 01:28:15,475
...listening to him...

1182
01:28:15,753 --> 01:28:18,415
...or pretending to listen
when you can't anymore.

1183
01:28:18,655 --> 01:28:21,920
It has to do with love,
like she was saying.

1184
01:28:22,259 --> 01:28:26,161
I don't know where it says a woman
has a corner on that market...

1185
01:28:26,363 --> 01:28:29,628
...that a man has any less
of those emotions than a woman.

1186
01:28:29,867 --> 01:28:33,166
Billy has a home with me.
I've made it the best I could.

1187
01:28:33,437 --> 01:28:36,270
It's not perfect.
I'm not a perfect parent.

1188
01:28:36,507 --> 01:28:39,067
Sometimes I don't
have enough patience

1189
01:28:39,243 --> 01:28:41,507
and I forget that he's a little kid.

1190
01:28:41,879 --> 01:28:43,278
But I'm there.

1191
01:28:44,982 --> 01:28:49,146
We eat breakfast and he talks to me,
and then we go to school.

1192
01:28:49,353 --> 01:28:53,653
At night we have dinner together and
we talk and I read to him and...

1193
01:28:54,958 --> 01:28:58,621
And we built a life together
and we love each other.

1194
01:29:05,669 --> 01:29:07,637
If you destroy that...

1195
01:29:09,173 --> 01:29:11,539
...it may be irreparable.

1196
01:29:19,416 --> 01:29:22,408
Joanna, don't do that, please.

1197
01:29:24,154 --> 01:29:27,385
- Don't do it twice to him.
- Thank you, Mr. Kramer.

1198
01:29:27,691 --> 01:29:29,249
No further questions.

1199
01:29:31,094 --> 01:29:33,494
How long have you
worked in advertising?

1200
01:29:33,730 --> 01:29:35,994
Ever since I graduated high school.

1201
01:29:37,267 --> 01:29:40,566
College, I mean.
I've been there about 15 years.

1202
01:29:40,971 --> 01:29:44,771
Would you say you've achieved a
certain status in your profession?

1203
01:29:44,975 --> 01:29:47,034
Yes, I have a good reputation.

1204
01:29:47,311 --> 01:29:50,940
When you worked at Roth, Kane
and Donovan, what was your salary?

1205
01:29:51,148 --> 01:29:53,275
Around $33,000 dollars a year
when I left.

1206
01:29:53,517 --> 01:29:56,145
Now you work at Norman, Craig
and Kummel?

1207
01:29:56,353 --> 01:29:58,344
- Yes.
- What is your salary?

1208
01:29:58,956 --> 01:30:01,151
It's almost 29,000.

1209
01:30:01,358 --> 01:30:03,792
Could you be more specific?

1210
01:30:04,127 --> 01:30:06,357
I make $28,200.

1211
01:30:06,797 --> 01:30:08,788
28,200.

1212
01:30:09,399 --> 01:30:13,836
You're the only person who's working
his way down the ladder of success.

1213
01:30:14,037 --> 01:30:18,565
Objection. Your Honor, I ask that
counsel's last remark be stricken.

1214
01:30:18,876 --> 01:30:19,808
Sustained.

1215
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:22,638
Is it true you were fired
from your previous job?

1216
01:30:22,913 --> 01:30:27,509
- I was let go.
- Will you tell us why you were let go?

1217
01:30:27,985 --> 01:30:30,215
There was a difference
of opinion in policy.

1218
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:35,082
Is it true your agency lost a major
account due to your negligence?

1219
01:30:35,559 --> 01:30:36,389
Objection!

1220
01:30:36,593 --> 01:30:39,391
I'm trying to establish
the witness's employment record.

1221
01:30:39,663 --> 01:30:41,995
He cannot hold a job.

1222
01:30:42,266 --> 01:30:43,824
I'll allow it, Mr. Shaunessy.

1223
01:30:44,902 --> 01:30:48,065
It's not unusual in advertising
for a client...

1224
01:30:48,338 --> 01:30:50,533
...to change his mind
and go elsewhere...

1225
01:30:51,408 --> 01:30:55,071
Was it true you walked out on a
client during a major presentation...

1226
01:30:55,412 --> 01:30:58,438
...saying that you had an appointment
with a teacher?

1227
01:30:58,715 --> 01:31:01,775
My son was sitting next to a kid
who was hitting and biting.

1228
01:31:02,052 --> 01:31:04,714
- Yes or no?
- Yes, but he bit my kid.

1229
01:31:05,022 --> 01:31:09,118
Last spring, did you miss a deadline
on the Mid-Atlantic account...

1230
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:11,919
...causing your company a
great deal of embarrassment...

1231
01:31:12,129 --> 01:31:14,120
...and considerable
financial liability?

1232
01:31:14,364 --> 01:31:17,128
On that day I had to go home
because my child was sick.

1233
01:31:17,367 --> 01:31:19,927
Did you or did you not
miss a deadline?

1234
01:31:20,203 --> 01:31:22,296
- My son was sick.
- Answer the question.

1235
01:31:22,572 --> 01:31:25,769
I'm trying to answer the question.
It's not yes or no.

1236
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:28,940
- Yes or no?
- He had a 104 temperature!

1237
01:31:29,146 --> 01:31:31,740
He's lying there sweating!
I go home to him!

1238
01:31:32,382 --> 01:31:36,819
Mr. Kramer, I urge you to stop
or I'll have to hold you in contempt.

1239
01:31:42,893 --> 01:31:44,485
I missed the deadline.

1240
01:31:45,329 --> 01:31:48,162
- Do you have a violent temper?
- No.

1241
01:31:48,432 --> 01:31:50,400
- Objection.
- I withdraw the question.

1242
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:53,626
- Do you consider yourself a fit parent?
- Yes, I do.

1243
01:31:53,904 --> 01:31:56,839
Is it true your child nearly lost
an eye while in your care?

1244
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:58,698
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1245
01:31:58,909 --> 01:32:00,399
Answer the question.

1246
01:32:00,677 --> 01:32:02,907
He was in the playground,
on the jungle gym...

1247
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:06,149
And fell and nearly lost an eye
while in your care.

1248
01:32:06,350 --> 01:32:07,681
He fell and cut himself.

1249
01:32:07,918 --> 01:32:09,510
Is it true you told your ex-wife...

1250
01:32:09,753 --> 01:32:13,450
...you were responsible for the
injury that disfigured your child?

1251
01:32:13,757 --> 01:32:14,951
Did you tell her:

1252
01:32:15,425 --> 01:32:18,758
"When it happened I felt guilty.
I felt it was my fault"?

1253
01:32:18,996 --> 01:32:21,988
- Objection!
- I have concluded my questions.

1254
01:32:57,868 --> 01:32:58,892
Ted?

1255
01:33:00,504 --> 01:33:01,903
Ted?

1256
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:11,973
I'm sorry. I mentioned the accident
to him two months ago...

1257
01:33:12,182 --> 01:33:15,242
...and I never thought he would
bring it up, never.

1258
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:18,185
Believe me.

1259
01:33:19,089 --> 01:33:23,389
I never would have mentioned it if
I thought he'd pull a thing like that.

1260
01:33:24,428 --> 01:33:25,690
I'm sorry.

1261
01:33:26,096 --> 01:33:27,393
I'm...

1262
01:33:38,875 --> 01:33:39,899
Ted.

1263
01:33:40,177 --> 01:33:42,202
- Hi.
- Hi. Here, let me help you.

1264
01:33:42,412 --> 01:33:43,674
Heard anything yet?

1265
01:33:43,914 --> 01:33:46,781
Any day. My lawyer says
no news is good news.

1266
01:33:47,084 --> 01:33:48,676
- Guess what.
- What?

1267
01:33:48,919 --> 01:33:51,513
Charley and I are talking about
getting back together.

1268
01:33:51,721 --> 01:33:54,417
Really?
Did he finally call you?

1269
01:33:54,624 --> 01:33:56,182
No, I called him.

1270
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:57,586
How come?

1271
01:33:57,861 --> 01:34:02,025
I don't know. I got to thinking
about a lot of things since the trial.

1272
01:34:02,265 --> 01:34:03,254
And...

1273
01:34:04,034 --> 01:34:06,764
I don't think it'll work out,
but he seems to want it.

1274
01:34:07,037 --> 01:34:10,302
That's terrific.
How do you feel?

1275
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:14,067
I don't know.
I feel scared, I guess.

1276
01:34:24,321 --> 01:34:26,255
- Hi.
- Hi.

1277
01:34:28,758 --> 01:34:30,055
I lost.

1278
01:34:31,394 --> 01:34:33,658
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

1279
01:34:42,606 --> 01:34:43,903
What happened?

1280
01:34:45,242 --> 01:34:48,575
The judge went for motherhood
right down the line.

1281
01:34:49,579 --> 01:34:53,743
"Ordered and decreed that the
petitioner be awarded custody...

1282
01:34:54,017 --> 01:34:56,281
...effective Monday,
the 23rd of January...

1283
01:34:56,653 --> 01:35:01,522
...that the respondent pay for the
support of the child, $400 a month.

1284
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:04,316
The father shall have the
following visitation rights:

1285
01:35:04,628 --> 01:35:08,325
Every other weekend, one night a
week to be mutually agreed upon...

1286
01:35:08,632 --> 01:35:11,430
...and one half of the child's
vacation period."

1287
01:35:11,668 --> 01:35:13,932
- That's it.
- What if I fight it?

1288
01:35:14,137 --> 01:35:16,002
I can't guarantee anything.

1289
01:35:16,206 --> 01:35:17,605
I'll take my chances.

1290
01:35:17,874 --> 01:35:20,172
- It'll cost you.
- I'll pay anything.

1291
01:35:20,877 --> 01:35:23,505
Look, Ted, I have to
tell you something.

1292
01:35:24,848 --> 01:35:27,544
This time it'll be Billy that pays.

1293
01:35:27,784 --> 01:35:29,877
I'll have to put him on the stand.

1294
01:35:30,353 --> 01:35:32,048
I can't do that.

1295
01:35:32,355 --> 01:35:34,346
No, I don't want to do that.

1296
01:35:37,127 --> 01:35:39,891
Thanks very much for your time.
I'm gonna take a walk.

1297
01:35:56,246 --> 01:35:58,737
Ted? It's me.

1298
01:36:04,054 --> 01:36:05,214
Ted?

1299
01:36:05,755 --> 01:36:07,313
I just heard.

1300
01:36:07,724 --> 01:36:09,385
Please go away.

1301
01:36:10,527 --> 01:36:12,518
Are you okay?

1302
01:36:14,097 --> 01:36:17,726
I just have to be by myself
for a while, Margaret.

1303
01:36:25,375 --> 01:36:26,433
I don't understand.

1304
01:36:26,743 --> 01:36:29,678
The problem is your mom and I
both want you to live with us.

1305
01:36:29,913 --> 01:36:34,247
So that's why we decided to go see
this man, who is the judge...

1306
01:36:34,451 --> 01:36:37,909
...and we let him decide because
he's very wise and experienced.

1307
01:36:38,121 --> 01:36:41,750
We talked to him for a few days
and then asked what he thought.

1308
01:36:42,025 --> 01:36:44,289
You know what?
He agreed with Mommy.

1309
01:36:44,527 --> 01:36:48,088
He thought it'd be terrific
if you lived with her from now on.

1310
01:36:48,365 --> 01:36:51,801
I'm lucky because I get to have
dinner with you once a week.

1311
01:36:52,068 --> 01:36:55,060
And twice a month
we spend the weekends together.

1312
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:59,871
Where's my bed gonna be?
Where am I gonna sleep?

1313
01:37:00,243 --> 01:37:04,304
Mommy's figured that all out. You
have your own bedroom at her place.

1314
01:37:05,782 --> 01:37:08,273
- Where will all my toys be?
- At Mommy's.

1315
01:37:08,485 --> 01:37:10,749
We're gonna take
all your toys over there.

1316
01:37:10,954 --> 01:37:14,048
If you play your cards right,
she'll buy you some new ones.

1317
01:37:15,158 --> 01:37:17,456
Who's gonna read me
my bedtime stories?

1318
01:37:17,894 --> 01:37:19,452
Mommy will.

1319
01:37:20,163 --> 01:37:22,654
You're not gonna kiss me
good night anymore?

1320
01:37:22,932 --> 01:37:25,162
No, I won't be able to do that.

1321
01:37:25,402 --> 01:37:28,838
But, you know, I get to visit.

1322
01:37:31,408 --> 01:37:33,933
It's gonna be okay. Really.

1323
01:37:34,144 --> 01:37:36,635
If I don't like it, can I come home?

1324
01:37:36,846 --> 01:37:38,438
What do you mean?

1325
01:37:38,682 --> 01:37:40,843
You'll have a great time with Mommy.

1326
01:37:41,084 --> 01:37:43,450
Really. She loves you so much.

1327
01:37:43,987 --> 01:37:45,318
Dad?

1328
01:37:46,356 --> 01:37:49,917
Don't forget, once, if you can
just call me up, okay?

1329
01:37:56,433 --> 01:37:58,264
We're gonna be okay.

1330
01:38:03,106 --> 01:38:05,199
Let's go get some ice cream.

1331
01:39:44,908 --> 01:39:47,741
Come on, let's get
this show on the road.

1332
01:39:49,779 --> 01:39:51,747
Let's get a little hustle now, okay?

1333
01:39:51,948 --> 01:39:53,745
Come on, set the table.

1334
01:40:02,425 --> 01:40:03,619
Come on.

1335
01:40:15,305 --> 01:40:16,738
Are you ready?

1336
01:40:35,158 --> 01:40:35,988
Yes?

1337
01:40:36,259 --> 01:40:38,853
<i>It's Joanna.
I'm downstairs in the lobby.</i>

1338
01:40:39,095 --> 01:40:41,529
<i>Can you come down here
and meet me alone?</i>

1339
01:40:48,605 --> 01:40:49,594
Hi.

1340
01:40:50,974 --> 01:40:52,168
What's up?

1341
01:40:56,613 --> 01:40:58,877
Tell me. What?
What's the matter?

1342
01:40:59,616 --> 01:41:01,550
I woke up this morning.

1343
01:41:05,488 --> 01:41:07,388
Kept thinking about Billy...

1344
01:41:07,657 --> 01:41:10,626
...and I was thinking about
him waking up in his room...

1345
01:41:10,827 --> 01:41:13,625
...with his little clouds
all around that I painted...

1346
01:41:13,863 --> 01:41:18,630
...and I thought I should have
painted clouds downtown because...

1347
01:41:20,303 --> 01:41:23,898
...then he would think that
he was waking up at home.

01:41:27,143 --> 01:41:30,340
I came here to take my son home.

1349
01:41:34,584 --> 01:41:37,018
And I realized he already is home.

1350
01:41:43,393 --> 01:41:45,827
I love him very much.

1351
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:53,498
I'm not gonna take him with me.

1352
01:42:02,412 --> 01:42:05,279
Can I go up and talk to him?

1353
01:42:05,615 --> 01:42:06,741
Yeah.

1354
01:42:14,857 --> 01:42:18,293
Why don't you go upstairs
and see him and I'll wait here.

1355
01:42:29,706 --> 01:42:31,230
How do I look?

1356
01:42:33,376 --> 01:42:34,365
Terrific.
