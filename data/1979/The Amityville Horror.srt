1
00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:36,913
Jesus Christ!
It gets worse all the time!

2
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:39,314
This job
doesn't get any better.

3
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:42,213
All shot in their beds,
execution style.

4
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,619
Only the mother
shot in the head.

5
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,556
What time you make it?
Give me a ballpark guess.

6
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,087
3:00... 3:15.

7
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,465
And that's pretty close.

8
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:56,525
Thanks.

9
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:00,004
How long
have you been waiting?

10
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:02,302
- Half an hour.
- Just a couple of minutes.

11
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:05,877
Over there,
that's the little gardening hut.

12
00:05:07,346 --> 00:05:09,246
- You mean that's included?
- Sure.

13
00:05:09,315 --> 00:05:11,374
It could be a guesthouse
with a little fixing up.

14
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,044
- A guesthouse?
- Sure.

15
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:16,987
Come on.
Right up here.

16
00:05:19,059 --> 00:05:21,789
See how much property you have?
Isn't that lovely?

17
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:27,361
Be careful. Don't trip.

18
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:32,167
You'll see what a beauty this is.

19
00:05:38,112 --> 00:05:40,637
There's nothing like it
on the market.

20
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,411
Not at this price.

21
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:48,187
- Come in.
- Thank you.

22
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:49,746
Impressive, isn't it?

23
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,727
I mean,
that's what I call charming.

24
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:55,855
- I'll show you the living room.
- Thank you.

25
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:01,929
That's a wood-burning fireplace.
It'll be nice on cold nights.

26
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:10,779
That's the sun porch.
Nice, isn't it?

27
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:13,840
- George, I don't think...
- Be cool.

28
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:17,819
- Would you like to see the kitchen?
- Yes, thank you.

29
00:06:17,888 --> 00:06:19,480
This is the kitchen.

30
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:22,389
Nice and spacious, isn't it?
Really big.

31
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,361
Has all the original hardware,
and everything works.

32
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:29,165
This your first house?

33
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:32,902
We just got married.

34
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:36,839
Shall we look at the upstairs?

35
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:40,936
I like to refer to this as a fixer-upper
that can be fun.

36
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:46,611
We'll start with this.

37
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:51,022
This is an extra room.

38
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:09,333
This is the bathroom
connecting with the next bedroom.

39
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,537
This is the second bedroom.

40
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:14,979
There's a nice view
of the river from here.

41
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:20,946
If you're planning on a big family,
there are three full bedrooms.

42
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,957
We already have a family.

43
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,118
Two boys and a girl.
Great kids.

44
00:07:29,097 --> 00:07:30,929
You are so bad.

45
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,695
- What?
- Cut it out.

46
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:43,507
Next is the master bedroom.

47
00:07:58,663 --> 00:07:59,823
I love it.

48
00:08:01,032 --> 00:08:02,966
There's just one more floor.

49
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:08,102
See anything you like...

50
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,576
we can include it in the price.

51
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:18,139
- Really?
- Sure.

52
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,260
This can be another bedroom...
or a playroom, whichever you prefer.

53
00:08:37,672 --> 00:08:41,768
We'll wander around on our own again
now that we got the layout.

54
00:08:41,843 --> 00:08:43,674
We can meet you downstairs.

55
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:46,239
How would that be?

56
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:50,415
I'll be in the kitchen.
Take your time.

57
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:52,386
We won't be long.

58
00:08:57,026 --> 00:09:00,086
- What do you think?
- I love it.

59
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:06,327
Honey... $80,000?

60
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:12,867
I mean...
it might as well be $800,000.

61
00:09:17,148 --> 00:09:18,376
Listen...

62
00:09:20,451 --> 00:09:24,911
The house is worth
$120,000 easy.

63
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,552
If I move my office into that cottage
out back, that'll save that rent.

64
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:31,926
And the boathouse...

65
00:09:31,997 --> 00:09:34,557
means I won't have to shell out
for mooring charges,

66
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:36,396
which they're raising,
by the way.

67
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:38,333
You didn't tell me that.

68
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:40,530
There was nothing
to be done about it.

69
00:09:41,306 --> 00:09:43,774
I just wish that...

70
00:09:43,842 --> 00:09:45,834
all those people
hadn't died here.

71
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:52,483
A guy kills his whole family?
Doesn't that bother you?

72
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:56,682
Sure, but...
houses don't have memories.

73
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:00,486
I don't know.

74
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:03,919
I do. The house
wouldn't even be for sale,

75
00:10:03,998 --> 00:10:05,966
and if it was,
we couldn't afford it

76
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:09,696
if we had...
tuna casseroles for a year.

77
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:14,604
You're gonna be very happy.
It's a wonderful house.

78
00:10:15,243 --> 00:10:17,074
I'm sure they'll accept your offer.

79
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:19,943
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll handle the details.

80
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:22,176
Just go on
and get ready to move.

81
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,976
They're not getting
too close to the river?

82
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,643
Uh-uh.

83
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,086
Sounds like a regular daddy
I hear over there.

84
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:33,820
I might feel like one if that's what they
started calling me instead of George.

85
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:37,830
Which I admit is better than that
Mr. Lutz crap they were giving me.

86
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:44,829
What do you
want to do with this?

87
00:11:46,475 --> 00:11:49,569
Put it in the living room
on that wall beside the bookshelf,

88
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:52,204
and the light will come through...
it'll look beautiful.

89
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:54,975
You got it.

90
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:08,594
VoilÃ !

91
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:12,694
Aw, shit. Come on.

92
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,382
I'm tired of
this damn sticky paper.

93
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:32,048
I wish I'd listened to my mother
and gotten the kind that you tack down.

94
00:12:32,123 --> 00:12:33,715
Nobody likes a quitter.

95
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:36,253
But I got an idea.

96
00:12:38,998 --> 00:12:41,558
Get a couple of beers
and go outside and play?

97
00:12:43,736 --> 00:12:46,102
What are those monsters up to?

98
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:02,114
Hello?

99
00:13:02,923 --> 00:13:04,390
Anybody home?

100
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,022
Hello?

101
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,130
George?

102
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:17,297
Kathy?

103
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:19,203
Anybody home?

104
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,410
Hello?

105
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:36,284
God's peace in this house.

106
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:57,803
<i>Get out.</i>

107
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,176
<i>Get out!</i>

108
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:05,308
Amy?

109
00:18:05,381 --> 00:18:07,508
Honey, dinner's ready.

110
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,278
- I'll get her.
- I've got her.

111
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:36,779
You and the boys start.

112
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,373
I'll take her upstairs
and put her to bed.

113
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,190
She wasn't outside!

114
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,056
Where was she?

115
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,463
Be getting in there
and eat your hot dogs.

116
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:19,517
- Hello?
- Hell...

117
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:21,722
Hello, Kathy?

118
00:19:26,068 --> 00:19:27,763
Can you hear me?

119
00:19:32,307 --> 00:19:34,138
Father Delaney.
There's something very import...

120
00:19:35,878 --> 00:19:37,243
Hello? Hello?

121
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:21,260
- Who was that?
- On the phone?

122
00:20:21,327 --> 00:20:22,817
Yeah.

123
00:20:22,895 --> 00:20:25,989
Just a bunch of static,
a bad connection or something.

124
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:28,762
I think Ma Bell's
gone wacko again.

125
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:36,102
Probably discover it was a collect call
from Japan when the bill comes.

126
00:20:36,176 --> 00:20:39,009
Did you make sure that
Amy's got her doll with her?

127
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,741
Yeah. She's sleeping with it.

128
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,810
You hungry, honey?

129
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,484
You don't want one of those charbroiled
hot dogs I did especially for you?

130
00:20:51,592 --> 00:20:53,059
No, I'm not hungry.

131
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,260
Damn, it's cold in here.

132
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:04,566
It felt cold a bit earlier,
but I think I've warmed up now.

133
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:09,303
It says 72.
It feels like 32.

134
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,772
Do you know
what I think it is?

135
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:14,373
There's a draft that
comes up from the basement

136
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:16,043
through that door down there.

137
00:21:20,023 --> 00:21:22,424
This house is supposed to be
well insulated.

138
00:21:22,493 --> 00:21:24,825
They'll nickel-and-dime you
to death.

139
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:19,179
Matt?

140
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:22,252
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

141
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,284
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No.

142
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:27,851
Those stairs are tricky.

143
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,922
Come on.
I'll take you upstairs.

144
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,659
We'll check
this all out tomorrow.

145
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:20,749
I'm sorry, baby.
I didn't mean to scare you.

146
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:24,688
I look at you all the time.

147
00:23:26,092 --> 00:23:27,616
I can't get used to you.

148
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:33,458
Who loves you?

149
00:23:37,137 --> 00:23:38,297
I'm lucky.

150
00:23:39,607 --> 00:23:43,407
- Come here.
- I just wanted to clean up first.

151
00:23:54,856 --> 00:23:57,017
I love the way
you smell right now.

152
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:09,531
I love you.

153
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:12,369
I love you back.

154
00:24:20,984 --> 00:24:24,784
You make me feel like a kid
in the back seat of a car.

155
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:36,760
I want us to work.
I want to be the best.

156
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:39,098
I don't want you
to have any regrets.

157
00:24:40,672 --> 00:24:42,162
I love you, Kathy.

158
00:25:39,936 --> 00:25:42,097
I want to go home.

159
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,331
Mommy, I want to go home.

160
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:48,377
What's this trouble?

161
00:25:48,444 --> 00:25:50,469
Come on, back to bed.

162
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:53,908
This is our home.
Don't you know that?

163
00:25:55,953 --> 00:25:57,113
There we go.

164
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:01,751
There you go, sweetie.

165
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:04,487
What's the matter,
having mean dreams?

166
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,328
Sleep tight.

167
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:51,770
It's not so easy, is it?

168
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:56,746
I guess people
have had to deal with this

169
00:26:56,818 --> 00:26:59,720
ever since Adam and Eve
got kicked out of the Garden.

170
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:04,022
Just have to learn
to live with it.

171
00:27:09,131 --> 00:27:10,291
Thank you.

172
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:07,314
You're one hell
of a watchdog, Harry.

173
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:14,024
Come on, boy.
Come on.

174
00:29:35,455 --> 00:29:37,480
What do you say?
Looks okay, huh?

175
00:31:22,103 --> 00:31:23,263
Don't ever do that.

176
00:31:24,505 --> 00:31:26,770
Not to a man
with an ax in his hand.

177
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:29,633
I thought
I could get a little help.

178
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,244
- Look what you made me do.
- I made you do?

179
00:31:34,316 --> 00:31:37,717
There's a week's worth of groceries
rolling down the walk.

180
00:31:37,786 --> 00:31:41,655
- Wait till I finish this stuff.
- George, finish?

181
00:31:41,724 --> 00:31:44,818
You have got enough wood here
to heat the whole South Shore.

182
00:31:58,675 --> 00:32:00,006
You take this.

183
00:32:01,011 --> 00:32:02,342
I'll get the rest.

184
00:32:02,413 --> 00:32:03,675
I love you.

185
00:32:09,454 --> 00:32:11,445
Broke a bulb.

186
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:17,361
Who drinks this
fancy kind of tea around here?

187
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:20,558
That's for Aunt Helena.
She's coming by around 2:00.

188
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:24,563
- Give me a break.
- Come on, be nice.

189
00:32:24,637 --> 00:32:26,366
This is a big event
in my family.

190
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:28,737
We've always been
a bunch of renters.

191
00:32:28,808 --> 00:32:31,436
This is the first time
anyone's bought a house.

192
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,207
Damn regimental inspection,
and we're not ready.

193
00:33:29,573 --> 00:33:33,031
Sweetie pie, you scared me.
What do you want?

194
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,237
My friend Jody
wants to play upstairs.

195
00:33:35,312 --> 00:33:37,837
Huh, Jody? See?

196
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:40,713
You and Jody go on up
and enjoy yourself.

197
00:33:40,784 --> 00:33:43,310
Does your friend Jody
like sugar cookies, too?

198
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,182
- I don't think so.
- No?

199
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,588
Off you go.

200
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,646
<i>This is Kathy Lutz.
Could I speak with Father Delaney?</i>

201
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:12,412
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lutz.

202
00:34:12,486 --> 00:34:14,954
The Father's not
feeling very well today.

203
00:34:15,022 --> 00:34:16,512
He's asleep right now.

204
00:34:17,424 --> 00:34:19,654
This is Father Bolen.
May I help you?

205
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:21,216
Father Bolen...

206
00:34:21,295 --> 00:34:24,527
He was supposed to come by
and bless the house yesterday,

207
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,624
but it can wait
till he feels better.

208
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:27,929
I hope he's not too sick?

209
00:34:28,002 --> 00:34:30,129
I think it's just
one of those flu things.

210
00:34:31,072 --> 00:34:34,269
But, Mrs. Lutz, the Father
was at your house yesterday.

211
00:34:34,342 --> 00:34:36,573
We were expecting him,
but he never showed up.

212
00:34:36,645 --> 00:34:39,409
I know he left
to go there.

213
00:34:39,481 --> 00:34:41,642
<i>He didn't come.
We waited all day.</i>

214
00:34:41,717 --> 00:34:43,981
Must've been
some kind of mix-up.

215
00:34:44,053 --> 00:34:47,454
<i>No big deal.
Just tell him "hi" and...</i>

216
00:34:47,523 --> 00:34:49,924
and that we hope
he's feeling better.

217
00:34:49,993 --> 00:34:52,461
I sure will.
Thank you for calling.

218
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:26,730
I'll check Amy's bathroom.

219
00:35:29,202 --> 00:35:31,932
Oh, does it stink!

220
00:35:34,574 --> 00:35:36,906
Mom, it stinks!

221
00:35:49,957 --> 00:35:53,358
Go down and let Aunt Helena in
and don't tell her about this, okay?

222
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:55,487
Do we have to?
She's always pinching!

223
00:35:55,563 --> 00:35:56,825
- Go now!
- Come on.

224
00:35:56,898 --> 00:35:58,229
Go on!

225
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,228
And be polite.

226
00:36:06,274 --> 00:36:09,733
Well, hello... Matthew!

227
00:36:09,812 --> 00:36:11,780
And Gregory!

228
00:36:11,847 --> 00:36:13,371
And Harry!

229
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:15,110
Where's your mother, dear?

230
00:36:15,184 --> 00:36:17,049
She said she'd
be down in a minute.

231
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:55,959
Aunt Helena?

232
00:36:56,028 --> 00:36:58,519
Kathleen! I'm sorry.

233
00:36:58,597 --> 00:37:01,259
I must've set it
too near the edge.

234
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:04,303
- I have to go.
- I don't understand.

235
00:37:04,371 --> 00:37:06,305
I don't feel well at all.

236
00:37:06,373 --> 00:37:10,036
I bought your favorite tea,
and I'll make you a cup.

237
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,079
I have to go.
I really feel terrible.

238
00:37:13,146 --> 00:37:15,740
- If you rested a while, you'd feel...
- I can't stay!

239
00:37:15,815 --> 00:37:18,808
- Please stay.
- I can't stay!

240
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:21,650
- I don't feel well!
- If you just rest and...

241
00:37:21,722 --> 00:37:24,350
I can't stay. Forgive me.

242
00:37:24,425 --> 00:37:26,393
George, please make her...

243
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:22,248
- Aren't you gonna come to bed?
- In a minute.

244
00:39:23,353 --> 00:39:24,684
The fire went out.

245
00:39:25,855 --> 00:39:27,550
Are you still cold?

246
00:39:32,863 --> 00:39:35,331
I hope you're not
coming down with something.

247
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:39,768
I'll be all right.

248
00:39:40,771 --> 00:39:43,262
I gotta stay healthy
for your brother's wedding.

249
00:39:53,752 --> 00:39:55,185
Your hair's getting long.

250
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:02,084
Maybe you should
sleep in tomorrow.

251
00:40:03,462 --> 00:40:05,123
I got work to do.

252
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:08,598
I don't want to be
up to my ass in boxes forever.

253
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,411
I'm sorry.

254
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,844
I don't know what
the hell's the matter with me.

255
00:40:28,056 --> 00:40:31,287
- Silly, this happens all the time.
- Not to me it doesn't.

256
00:40:32,026 --> 00:40:35,120
Stop pushing. You don't
have to prove anything to me.

257
00:40:51,848 --> 00:40:53,042
Turn out the light.

258
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:05,889
I love you.

259
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,297
I love you back.

260
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,293
She was shot in the head!

261
00:41:43,403 --> 00:41:44,701
You all right?

262
00:42:13,536 --> 00:42:16,562
- Tell me something, Father.
- What?

263
00:42:18,074 --> 00:42:20,065
Why couldn't this
wait till tomorrow?

264
00:42:21,077 --> 00:42:22,601
I don't know. I...

265
00:42:24,013 --> 00:42:26,505
All I know is
I have to get back to that house.

266
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,285
- Are you feeling all right?
- I'm fine. Fine, fine.

267
00:42:40,665 --> 00:42:43,463
Father, there's something wrong
with the steering wheel.

268
00:42:46,938 --> 00:42:48,803
I can't move the wheel.

269
00:43:01,186 --> 00:43:02,483
What's wrong with this?

270
00:43:39,294 --> 00:43:41,592
Harry, be quiet!

271
00:43:42,164 --> 00:43:43,791
Be quiet!

272
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:10,786
Will you check this, please?

273
00:44:10,861 --> 00:44:13,126
It's gotta come to 1,500 bucks
for the caterer.

274
00:44:13,198 --> 00:44:16,725
- That sucker wants cash.
- Jimmy, will you relax?

275
00:44:16,801 --> 00:44:19,292
You've counted it
about a thousand times.

276
00:44:25,878 --> 00:44:28,108
You sure do look terrific.

277
00:44:37,223 --> 00:44:39,317
You're not gonna
start to cry already?

278
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:44,991
It's just that yesterday,

279
00:44:45,065 --> 00:44:47,533
I was riding you around
on the back of my bike.

280
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,929
And now you're getting married.

281
00:44:50,837 --> 00:44:51,929
I sure am.

282
00:44:56,744 --> 00:44:59,269
I'm just real happy for you.
That's all, hon.

283
00:45:06,755 --> 00:45:08,916
Hey, there he is.

284
00:45:10,726 --> 00:45:14,162
- George, you look terrible!
- So she keeps telling me.

285
00:45:14,229 --> 00:45:16,720
It's some kind of
flu virus going around.

286
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:18,493
Amy's got it, too.
It's nothing.

287
00:45:18,567 --> 00:45:21,366
If you're not up to it,
I'd understand.

288
00:45:21,437 --> 00:45:23,405
I'm your best man.

289
00:45:24,007 --> 00:45:27,067
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

290
00:45:27,143 --> 00:45:30,544
Mrs. Lutz, am I supposed to
give Amy an aspirin or anything?

291
00:45:30,613 --> 00:45:33,105
Just give her one
before bed, okay?

292
00:45:33,183 --> 00:45:34,172
Okay.

293
00:45:35,185 --> 00:45:38,154
- Are you gonna be okay?
- I don't know.

294
00:45:41,692 --> 00:45:43,057
What's the matter?

295
00:45:44,194 --> 00:45:47,289
- The money.
- What money?

296
00:45:47,365 --> 00:45:49,333
The money for the caterer.
$1,500.

297
00:45:49,401 --> 00:45:51,028
I put it in this pocket.

298
00:45:51,102 --> 00:45:54,128
- It must've fallen out.
- It's not here.

299
00:45:55,974 --> 00:45:57,202
I'll look under here.

300
00:45:59,611 --> 00:46:00,874
Did you check your pants?

301
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:08,017
Calm down. It can't have
gotten up and walked away.

302
00:46:08,087 --> 00:46:09,850
If you had it here,
it's gotta be here.

303
00:46:09,922 --> 00:46:11,219
What am I gonna do?

304
00:46:12,224 --> 00:46:13,624
I can't believe it!

305
00:46:18,265 --> 00:46:20,733
Will you get those kids
off that horn?

306
00:46:20,801 --> 00:46:22,325
Jimmy, George.

307
00:46:23,003 --> 00:46:25,733
We have to go.
We're getting very late.

308
00:46:25,806 --> 00:46:27,138
What am I gonna do?

309
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,669
It's gotta be here someplace.

310
00:46:30,745 --> 00:46:32,303
We'll look when we get home.

311
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,904
What about the caterer?

312
00:46:37,352 --> 00:46:40,220
I'll take care of him.
I'll write him a check.

313
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:41,847
Sweetie.

314
00:46:42,358 --> 00:46:43,620
Okay?

315
00:46:45,127 --> 00:46:46,424
I'll get the kids.

316
00:47:06,316 --> 00:47:08,148
It's freezing in here!

317
00:47:11,822 --> 00:47:14,689
It's time for bed, Amy.
I gotta give you an aspirin.

318
00:47:14,759 --> 00:47:18,820
I don't wanna go to bed.
I wanna play with Jody.

319
00:47:18,896 --> 00:47:21,092
Your mom said I had to
put you to bed early

320
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:22,793
because you've been sick.

321
00:47:22,868 --> 00:47:24,460
Don't smart off to me.

322
00:47:24,536 --> 00:47:28,233
I wasn't sick.
I just didn't like meatloaf.

323
00:47:28,306 --> 00:47:30,501
Let's get you
into your pajamas.

324
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:54,328
Amy, open the door.

325
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,772
I'm in the closet.
Open the door.

326
00:48:08,014 --> 00:48:09,845
Amy, I mean it!

327
00:48:16,957 --> 00:48:20,017
Come to the door!
Open it!

328
00:48:22,763 --> 00:48:25,994
For Christ's sake!
Open the door!

329
00:48:43,018 --> 00:48:45,350
Amy, open the door!

330
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:00,061
For Christ's sake,
open the door!

331
00:49:25,864 --> 00:49:27,024
How are you?

332
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:30,193
- Are you feeling better?
- Fine.

333
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:31,964
I want to apologize
for the other day.

334
00:49:32,037 --> 00:49:33,937
- Don't worry.
- I don't know what happened.

335
00:49:34,006 --> 00:49:36,999
I hadn't gone half a block
from your house,

336
00:49:37,076 --> 00:49:38,668
and I was violently ill.

337
00:49:38,745 --> 00:49:40,770
I think there's a virus
going around.

338
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:43,645
Father Delaney's got something,
and Amy's got something.

339
00:49:43,716 --> 00:49:46,742
And I don't know
what's the matter with George.

340
00:49:48,188 --> 00:49:51,021
I'll talk to you later, okay?

341
00:50:04,339 --> 00:50:05,829
I'm gonna write you a check.

342
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:09,504
The deal was cash. Cash.

343
00:50:09,577 --> 00:50:12,171
The cash is lost.
You gotta take a check.

344
00:50:12,247 --> 00:50:13,407
I don't like checks.

345
00:50:13,481 --> 00:50:15,746
Let me tell you something
about checks.

346
00:50:15,818 --> 00:50:18,048
Checks get cancelled.
Checks bounce.

347
00:50:19,121 --> 00:50:22,682
Checks is not cash.
Cash is cash.

348
00:50:22,758 --> 00:50:24,623
Listen to me, pal...

349
00:50:25,795 --> 00:50:27,626
I don't like lectures,

350
00:50:27,697 --> 00:50:30,633
and I don't like
being hassled in the men's room.

351
00:50:30,701 --> 00:50:32,328
I'm gonna write you a check.

352
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:35,070
Either that's
good enough for you,

353
00:50:35,138 --> 00:50:37,698
or you're gonna eat
your own goddamn food.

354
00:50:40,077 --> 00:50:41,169
Look at this...

355
00:50:41,244 --> 00:50:44,146
I want cash,
and they're giving me checks.

356
00:50:46,417 --> 00:50:47,577
You all right, honey?

357
00:50:47,652 --> 00:50:50,143
I don't think I can make it
through the reception.

358
00:50:51,122 --> 00:50:52,714
Let's get the kids and split.

359
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:54,815
I'll get the kids.
You take it easy.

360
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,484
Down.

361
00:51:28,596 --> 00:51:30,120
Matt, get over here.

362
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:37,901
Matt, straight upstairs
and right to bed.

363
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:39,338
- But why?
- Upstairs.

364
00:51:39,408 --> 00:51:41,501
- I'm not even tired!
- You are so tired.

365
00:51:41,576 --> 00:51:42,565
I am not!

366
00:51:42,644 --> 00:51:44,771
You're tired
'cause I said you're tired.

367
00:51:44,846 --> 00:51:46,211
Cut that out.

368
00:51:46,281 --> 00:51:48,715
I'll bring you
some milk and cookies.

369
00:51:49,919 --> 00:51:51,409
Let me out.

370
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,891
Amy? Amy, are you okay?

371
00:52:02,499 --> 00:52:03,557
Jackie?

372
00:52:04,368 --> 00:52:07,565
- Oh, my God!
- I couldn't get out!

373
00:52:07,638 --> 00:52:09,299
The door closed
and it locked,

374
00:52:09,373 --> 00:52:10,863
and I couldn't get out!

375
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:13,569
- There's no lock on this door.
- It wouldn't open.

376
00:52:13,644 --> 00:52:15,635
- Take a look.
- Look, see?

377
00:52:19,217 --> 00:52:20,878
It wouldn't open!

378
00:52:21,786 --> 00:52:24,584
Why didn't you open the door?
Why didn't you answer me?

379
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:29,084
Why didn't you unlock the door?
You heard Jackie knocking.

380
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,958
Jody wouldn't let me.

381
00:52:31,697 --> 00:52:32,857
Jody? Who's Jody?

382
00:52:32,932 --> 00:52:36,527
She's my friend.
She comes to play with me.

383
00:52:36,602 --> 00:52:40,060
Jesus Christ! What the hell
are we standing here listening to?

384
00:52:40,139 --> 00:52:42,130
And weren't you told
to go to bed?

385
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:45,101
Go on! Get out of here!

386
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,940
These kids of yours need
some goddamn discipline.

387
00:52:54,387 --> 00:52:56,856
Here, let me see.
I'll go get something for them.

388
00:52:56,924 --> 00:53:00,416
- George yelled at me.
- You should've opened the door!

389
00:53:02,296 --> 00:53:04,821
Jody doesn't like George.

390
00:53:48,546 --> 00:53:51,380
Where the hell is it?!

391
00:53:55,954 --> 00:53:58,889
There's an explanation for all of it.

392
00:53:58,957 --> 00:54:02,017
I'm not in the habit of blaming Satan
for every phenomenon.

393
00:54:02,093 --> 00:54:03,253
Neither am I, Father.

394
00:54:03,329 --> 00:54:05,559
Well, for a modernist,

395
00:54:05,631 --> 00:54:08,225
who thought Vatican II
didn't go far enough,

396
00:54:08,301 --> 00:54:10,462
don't you think
you sound a little medieval?

397
00:54:13,306 --> 00:54:15,604
My being a modernist
has nothing to do with it.

398
00:54:15,675 --> 00:54:17,906
I happened to
check into the murders

399
00:54:17,978 --> 00:54:20,173
and the 20-year-old boy
who killed his parents

400
00:54:20,247 --> 00:54:21,680
and his four brothers and sisters.

401
00:54:21,748 --> 00:54:27,243
When he was at trial, he testified
that he heard voices in the house.

402
00:54:27,321 --> 00:54:29,186
The voices told him to do it!

403
00:54:29,256 --> 00:54:31,987
I was in the house,
and I heard the voices, too!

404
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,255
And I also felt
the presence in the house.

405
00:54:34,329 --> 00:54:36,729
There was a presence
in that house!

406
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:40,564
Half the killers in this country
say the same thing.

407
00:54:40,635 --> 00:54:43,628
"The voices.
The voices told me to do it."

408
00:54:43,706 --> 00:54:47,301
I heard them, Father!
I heard voices!

409
00:54:47,376 --> 00:54:50,072
Then explain my hand
if you can do that.

410
00:54:50,145 --> 00:54:52,636
Go on! Explain how
the car went out of control.

411
00:54:52,715 --> 00:54:55,047
Father Bolen was with me.
You tell him.

412
00:54:56,785 --> 00:54:58,947
The wheel locked,
and then the...

413
00:54:59,022 --> 00:55:00,819
The wheel locked.

414
00:55:01,858 --> 00:55:03,723
How about
a mechanical defect?

415
00:55:03,793 --> 00:55:06,728
I'd blame Detroit
a lot faster than the devil.

416
00:55:06,796 --> 00:55:10,494
Seems like every month
there's some kind of recall.

417
00:55:14,905 --> 00:55:19,467
I see. We're just gonna
walk away from it.

418
00:55:20,278 --> 00:55:22,678
Has that become
the fashion now, to cover up?

419
00:55:22,747 --> 00:55:24,807
Nothing to walk away from.

420
00:55:25,884 --> 00:55:28,785
- I think it's nonsense!
- There's nothing to cover up.

421
00:55:28,854 --> 00:55:32,255
I think
it's bureaucratical bullshit!

422
00:55:33,392 --> 00:55:35,292
What do you think I am?

423
00:55:37,095 --> 00:55:40,532
I am not some
pink cheat seminarian

424
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,192
who doesn't know the difference

425
00:55:42,268 --> 00:55:45,237
between the supernatural
and a bad clam.

426
00:55:45,305 --> 00:55:48,706
I am a trained psychotherapist!
I went into that house!

427
00:55:48,775 --> 00:55:52,143
What I saw there was real,
what I felt there was real,

428
00:55:52,212 --> 00:55:55,409
and what I
heard there was real!

429
00:55:55,482 --> 00:55:59,543
Gentlemen, I have a family
in my parish that's at great risk!

430
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,781
And they are facing
real danger.

431
00:56:03,857 --> 00:56:06,952
Who the hell
do you think you are?!

432
00:56:07,028 --> 00:56:09,189
You think your secular education

433
00:56:09,264 --> 00:56:12,233
gives you the right
to question the Church?

434
00:56:13,301 --> 00:56:14,427
Sit down!

435
00:56:16,237 --> 00:56:17,762
Sit!

436
00:56:30,419 --> 00:56:32,684
You haven't told us one thing

437
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:36,248
that can't be written off
as simple hysteria.

438
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:41,660
Even psychotherapists
lose touch with reality sometimes.

439
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,566
Your education
doesn't give you any immunity.

440
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:51,702
Father Nuncio and I
have seen our share of phenomena,

441
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:56,110
and never once did any of them
turn out to be Satanist!

442
00:57:00,586 --> 00:57:03,419
Let's understand each other, Father.

443
00:57:06,859 --> 00:57:09,828
To me, the Church...

444
00:57:11,296 --> 00:57:12,628
It's my home.

445
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,668
The Church is my strength.

446
00:57:24,979 --> 00:57:26,970
And I need her now.

447
00:57:27,047 --> 00:57:29,777
And that family...

448
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:32,842
needs her... now.

449
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,259
Frank...

450
00:57:41,096 --> 00:57:43,929
How long has it been
since you've seen your family?

451
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:50,466
What do you mean?

452
00:57:50,539 --> 00:57:53,373
We think you
should take a vacation.

453
00:57:58,181 --> 00:57:59,580
Good morning, Father.

454
00:57:59,649 --> 00:58:01,844
Good day, Father.

455
00:58:03,553 --> 00:58:05,715
You could do
with a haircut and shave.

456
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,766
- What do you think?
- Very uptown.

457
00:58:49,836 --> 00:58:51,428
I thought you guys
had a small business.

458
00:58:51,505 --> 00:58:54,770
Believe me, we do.
Getting smaller all the time.

459
00:58:56,409 --> 00:58:57,808
What's the matter?

460
00:59:01,549 --> 00:59:03,380
I don't want to go any closer.

461
00:59:04,385 --> 00:59:07,218
Carolyn, what are you
talking about?

462
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:11,180
It gives me the creeps.

463
00:59:32,549 --> 00:59:35,313
Hiya, George.
How's it going?

464
00:59:39,256 --> 00:59:42,191
I wouldn't have come out
and bothered you,

465
00:59:42,259 --> 00:59:43,920
but your line's always busy.

466
00:59:43,994 --> 00:59:46,690
Nobody's seen you for days.

467
00:59:48,332 --> 00:59:50,857
You haven't been in
to sign the payroll checks.

468
00:59:51,902 --> 00:59:54,133
I did us both a favor
and brought them along.

469
00:59:54,205 --> 00:59:57,368
- Here.
- What day is this?

470
00:59:57,442 --> 00:59:58,670
Thursday.

471
01:00:00,879 --> 01:00:02,369
Thursday.

472
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:10,485
I promised the men
I'd hand-deliver these.

473
01:00:10,556 --> 01:00:12,490
Should've been paid yesterday.

474
01:00:15,161 --> 01:00:19,120
Some caterer's screaming you wrote
him a personal check that bounced.

475
01:00:22,102 --> 01:00:23,467
I should've covered that.

476
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:25,732
And some guy from the IRS
has been calling.

477
01:00:25,806 --> 01:00:27,967
Don't you have any good news?

478
01:00:32,312 --> 01:00:37,580
Yeah... I brought you
the spotlight for your boat.

479
01:00:43,825 --> 01:00:46,294
Come on.
I'll put it on for you.

480
01:01:05,949 --> 01:01:08,941
You girls think I don't know
what you're up to?

481
01:01:09,019 --> 01:01:11,180
Well, I do.

482
01:01:11,254 --> 01:01:16,386
And if I ever catch you again,
you're gonna be in big trouble.

483
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:20,624
You girls hear me?
Janet, you listening?

484
01:01:20,698 --> 01:01:23,064
Now, don't be a smart-ass.

485
01:01:27,139 --> 01:01:30,438
You quit that!
Stop teasing me!

486
01:01:34,513 --> 01:01:37,505
What are you two rascals
doing in my room?

487
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:47,121
Oh, my God!

488
01:01:55,502 --> 01:01:57,800
Goddamn thing feels like
it's nailed shut.

489
01:02:00,207 --> 01:02:02,698
Push! Can't you just get it up?

490
01:02:29,705 --> 01:02:32,139
Hold it up.
Don't let that down.

491
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:33,436
I'll drive, honey.

492
01:02:33,509 --> 01:02:35,444
- Amazing.
- What?

493
01:02:35,512 --> 01:02:37,571
Not one broken bone.

494
01:02:47,992 --> 01:02:49,892
George, are you awake?

495
01:02:54,298 --> 01:02:58,325
Isn't it strange that none of the bones
are broken in Greg's hand?

496
01:03:03,075 --> 01:03:05,236
I have to talk to you.

497
01:05:27,829 --> 01:05:29,320
- What was that?
- I don't know.

498
01:05:29,399 --> 01:05:31,492
- You stay up here.
- Like hell!

499
01:05:40,043 --> 01:05:42,274
Wait, wait.

500
01:05:54,692 --> 01:05:57,924
Goddammit!
Don't sneak up on me!

501
01:05:58,897 --> 01:06:01,866
You call the police.
I'm gonna go check on something.

502
01:06:01,933 --> 01:06:03,230
It's okay, sweetie.

503
01:07:00,929 --> 01:07:04,491
- Sarge, what brings you out?
- Insomnia.

504
01:07:12,776 --> 01:07:15,837
- What do you got?
- Beats the hell out of me.

505
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:37,764
- What do you got?
- This is Mrs. Lutz, Sergeant.

506
01:07:37,836 --> 01:07:39,235
Mrs. Lutz.

507
01:07:40,372 --> 01:07:42,135
And George Lutz.

508
01:07:50,716 --> 01:07:53,776
- Is that L-u-t-z-e?
- No "e".

509
01:07:53,853 --> 01:07:56,049
The basement door's
the same as the front.

510
01:07:58,492 --> 01:08:01,757
- Where's the basement?
- Come on, I'll show you.

511
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,714
Who let you in?

512
01:08:27,189 --> 01:08:28,816
What are you
doing there, boy?

513
01:08:34,497 --> 01:08:36,089
No broken windows.

514
01:08:39,436 --> 01:08:41,427
How long you been living here?

515
01:08:41,505 --> 01:08:43,029
A couple of weeks.

516
01:08:44,808 --> 01:08:48,039
Are you related to the family
that was here before?

517
01:08:49,346 --> 01:08:50,814
Uh-uh.

518
01:08:51,682 --> 01:08:54,549
You look a lot like them.
The kid had the same...

519
01:08:55,553 --> 01:08:57,214
Harry, knock it off!

520
01:09:06,798 --> 01:09:10,290
Have you had any trouble
with vandals or trespassers?

521
01:09:10,369 --> 01:09:12,200
What's that supposed to mean?

522
01:09:12,271 --> 01:09:15,297
Well... you've got a door

523
01:09:15,374 --> 01:09:18,344
that was broken outward
from the inside.

524
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:23,776
Burglars break in, and you've got
a front door that's broken out.

525
01:09:24,751 --> 01:09:26,446
Let me tell you something...

526
01:09:26,519 --> 01:09:29,283
somebody broke into my house,
they heard me coming,

527
01:09:29,355 --> 01:09:30,914
and they took off.

528
01:09:31,926 --> 01:09:34,053
Okay. Then who broke
the basement door?

529
01:09:35,229 --> 01:09:38,357
Maybe they came in
through the cellar...

530
01:09:38,432 --> 01:09:39,922
then ran out the front door.

531
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,696
No. I checked all the windows
down there. None broken.

532
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:46,036
You think it was faster
to break it down than to open it?

533
01:09:54,216 --> 01:09:56,480
There'll be a tighter watch
on your house.

534
01:09:57,053 --> 01:09:59,544
You call us
if anything happens, okay?

535
01:10:00,156 --> 01:10:01,316
Uh-huh.

536
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:02,550
Good night.

537
01:10:04,527 --> 01:10:05,687
Night.

538
01:11:04,725 --> 01:11:06,750
Why is it all going wrong?

539
01:11:08,562 --> 01:11:10,530
We have to do something.

540
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,288
Jody says everything's
gonna get better.

541
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,056
What does Jody look like?

542
01:11:41,264 --> 01:11:46,931
I mean... is Jody big
or thin or fat or...

543
01:11:47,004 --> 01:11:49,097
She's nice.

544
01:11:50,741 --> 01:11:54,609
- She tells me things, too.
- Like what does she tell you?

545
01:11:54,678 --> 01:11:58,672
She tells me about the little boy
who used to live in my room.

546
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:01,275
He got hurt, and he died.

547
01:12:02,754 --> 01:12:04,551
And what else
does Jody tell you?

548
01:12:04,622 --> 01:12:07,819
She says she wants me
to live here forever and ever

549
01:12:07,892 --> 01:12:10,554
so we can all play together.

550
01:12:32,652 --> 01:12:36,213
Bye, sweeties.
Be home by 3:30, okay?

551
01:12:37,224 --> 01:12:38,590
Be careful.

552
01:13:53,706 --> 01:13:55,264
Oh, answer.

553
01:14:06,019 --> 01:14:07,884
Please answer.

554
01:14:23,538 --> 01:14:24,903
Hello?

555
01:14:24,973 --> 01:14:29,411
Father, this is Kathy Lutz,
and I have to talk to you!

556
01:14:32,481 --> 01:14:34,278
Listen to what I'm telling you...

557
01:14:35,618 --> 01:14:37,108
Father?

558
01:14:57,742 --> 01:15:00,176
O Lord, hear my prayer...

559
01:15:01,245 --> 01:15:03,406
and hasten to answer me.

560
01:15:46,661 --> 01:15:48,288
Hello.

561
01:15:48,363 --> 01:15:51,958
Everybody wanted to come over
to welcome you to the neighborhood.

562
01:15:54,102 --> 01:15:55,626
It's all right, isn't it?

563
01:15:59,942 --> 01:16:01,307
Just a minute, please.

564
01:16:05,281 --> 01:16:06,475
Hello?

565
01:17:00,273 --> 01:17:03,208
Thanks for coming.
I thought I might be stood up.

566
01:17:03,276 --> 01:17:06,643
Don't give me any crap.
I don't have time for it.

567
01:17:06,713 --> 01:17:10,707
Relax, will ya?
I just wanna buy you a drink.

568
01:17:10,785 --> 01:17:13,083
- Couple of beers, please?
- Gotcha.

569
01:17:18,959 --> 01:17:22,123
Are you all right?
I mean, you look terrible.

570
01:17:22,197 --> 01:17:23,528
Here you are, pal.

571
01:17:24,633 --> 01:17:28,330
Jesus, I'm sorry.
You look just like that kid.

572
01:17:28,403 --> 01:17:31,839
He was sitting right in that seat
when he was arrested.

573
01:17:31,907 --> 01:17:33,465
What are you talking about?

574
01:17:33,542 --> 01:17:35,909
The kid last year
that killed his family.

575
01:17:35,978 --> 01:17:39,744
The house down by the river?
You're the spittin' image.

576
01:17:39,816 --> 01:17:43,274
- So?
- So, I'll bring you another brew.

577
01:17:44,187 --> 01:17:45,313
No offense.

578
01:17:47,658 --> 01:17:49,888
I gotta get out of here.
I'll talk to you later.

579
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,360
No, now.
We gotta talk now.

580
01:17:52,429 --> 01:17:54,090
The business is falling apart.

581
01:17:54,164 --> 01:17:56,359
People are calling.
Bills have to be paid.

582
01:17:56,433 --> 01:17:58,833
I know you're busy unpacking,
but life goes on.

583
01:17:58,902 --> 01:18:01,394
I'm warning you,
I don't have the patience.

584
01:18:01,473 --> 01:18:03,907
You're warning me.
Give me a break. Talk to me!

585
01:18:08,413 --> 01:18:11,576
I knew this would happen.
I told you you were taking on too much.

586
01:18:11,649 --> 01:18:14,050
- Just drop it!
- You marry a dame with three kids,

587
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,645
you buy a big house
with mortgages up to your ass,

588
01:18:16,722 --> 01:18:20,658
you change your religion,
and you forget about business.

589
01:18:28,268 --> 01:18:31,396
Okay... now can we talk?

590
01:18:34,741 --> 01:18:36,299
Christ, man, I'm sorry.

591
01:18:36,376 --> 01:18:38,367
I don't know
what I was thinking.

592
01:18:38,979 --> 01:18:41,346
Okay. Come on.

593
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:46,886
Jesus loves me,
this I know

594
01:18:46,954 --> 01:18:51,516
For the Bible tells me so

595
01:18:51,592 --> 01:18:56,394
Little ones to Him belong

596
01:18:56,465 --> 01:19:01,232
They are weak,
but He is strong

597
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:06,172
Yes, Jesus loves me

598
01:19:14,217 --> 01:19:16,208
The Bible...

599
01:19:18,154 --> 01:19:19,781
Who you singing to, princess?

600
01:19:19,856 --> 01:19:22,087
You scared Jody.

601
01:19:22,726 --> 01:19:24,125
Jody?

602
01:19:25,095 --> 01:19:27,086
Look, there's no one here, see?

603
01:19:27,164 --> 01:19:28,688
You scared her.

604
01:19:28,766 --> 01:19:30,757
She went out the window.

605
01:19:31,802 --> 01:19:33,394
She went out the window?

606
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:37,032
I'd better check and make sure
she's not still there.

607
01:19:49,522 --> 01:19:51,922
The house is doing things.

608
01:19:51,991 --> 01:19:54,482
I mean, windows open
by themselves.

609
01:19:55,695 --> 01:19:58,459
Rooms full of flies
at the wrong time of year.

610
01:19:58,531 --> 01:20:01,695
You saw what happened
to Greg's hand.

611
01:20:01,768 --> 01:20:03,599
It's crazy.

612
01:20:05,372 --> 01:20:08,273
Last night the front door
was ripped off its hinges

613
01:20:08,342 --> 01:20:09,934
from the inside.

614
01:20:11,278 --> 01:20:14,111
Of course!
It's right here, it's history.

615
01:20:15,183 --> 01:20:16,241
John Ketchum.

616
01:20:16,317 --> 01:20:18,717
- So?
- Listen.

617
01:20:18,786 --> 01:20:22,187
They ran him out of Salem
for being a witch.

618
01:20:24,092 --> 01:20:26,617
And he built his house
exactly where you're living.

619
01:20:28,062 --> 01:20:31,328
You're living on
some sort of special ground...

620
01:20:32,601 --> 01:20:38,562
devil worship...
death... sacrifice.

621
01:20:41,477 --> 01:20:43,639
There's one simple rule...

622
01:20:44,547 --> 01:20:46,879
Energy cannot be
created or destroyed.

623
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:48,417
It can only change forms.

624
01:20:48,485 --> 01:20:50,453
Carolyn, will you get a grip
on yourself?

625
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,647
You sound like
some kind of psycho weirdo!

626
01:20:52,722 --> 01:20:57,524
Come on, Jeffrey. Don't be
such a hard-core rationalist.

627
01:20:57,595 --> 01:21:00,621
Everything in life
cannot be explained by a slide rule.

628
01:21:00,698 --> 01:21:03,132
Thank you very much
for your cosmic views.

629
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,792
Now do me a favor, shut up!

630
01:21:11,043 --> 01:21:14,274
Can I make
a rational suggestion, please?

631
01:21:16,415 --> 01:21:19,612
Sure, man. Anything.

632
01:21:21,553 --> 01:21:24,387
Go home, get cleaned up...

633
01:21:24,457 --> 01:21:27,085
take Kathy out to dinner.

634
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,219
Carolyn and I
will baby-sit the kids.

635
01:21:30,129 --> 01:21:33,121
You gotta get away from it,
even for a couple of hours,

636
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:37,398
and when you get back...
we'll add it all up.

637
01:21:37,471 --> 01:21:39,200
We'll talk this thing through.

638
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:47,340
Okay.

639
01:21:48,582 --> 01:21:49,914
Let's go home.

640
01:22:04,567 --> 01:22:06,330
I'll go in and talk to Kathy,

641
01:22:06,402 --> 01:22:08,734
and you all come in
in a couple of minutes.

642
01:22:20,283 --> 01:22:22,251
He told us to wait out here.

643
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:24,048
Jeff...

644
01:22:25,288 --> 01:22:26,915
I gotta see it for myself.

645
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:29,482
I thought that place
gave you the creeps.

646
01:22:34,165 --> 01:22:36,156
Are those vibes ever strong.

647
01:22:37,902 --> 01:22:39,426
It really pulls on you.

648
01:22:41,572 --> 01:22:44,770
I gotta see the basement.
That's where it's coming from.

649
01:22:44,843 --> 01:22:47,641
I'm very sensitive
about these things.

650
01:22:49,448 --> 01:22:51,006
And I know about them.

651
01:22:54,853 --> 01:22:57,254
Come on,
knock it off, will you?

652
01:22:59,859 --> 01:23:02,191
What I saw was not a cat.

653
01:23:05,065 --> 01:23:06,692
It could've climbed up the ivy.

654
01:23:06,766 --> 01:23:09,257
It's all over the side
of the damn house.

655
01:23:12,273 --> 01:23:14,741
I don't have
all the answers yet.

656
01:23:15,409 --> 01:23:18,037
We gotta get
some perspective on this thing.

657
01:23:20,414 --> 01:23:22,815
Come on,
let's take Jeff's offer.

658
01:23:23,752 --> 01:23:25,117
Put yourself together.

659
01:23:26,121 --> 01:23:28,749
Let's get the hell away from it
for a couple of hours.

660
01:23:30,392 --> 01:23:31,723
We'll get dressed...

661
01:23:33,361 --> 01:23:35,522
I just gotta check
the fire first.

662
01:23:45,808 --> 01:23:47,799
Demons are smart.

663
01:23:48,244 --> 01:23:50,475
They're not just monsters. They...

664
01:23:52,483 --> 01:23:55,748
They think
just like you and I do.

665
01:23:56,420 --> 01:24:00,151
Just in reverse.
It's a closed system.

666
01:24:01,859 --> 01:24:04,192
Now you're beginning
to give me the creeps.

667
01:24:07,765 --> 01:24:10,996
There was a tribe of Indians
called the Shinnecocks,

668
01:24:11,069 --> 01:24:14,596
and they used this land
as a sort of exposure pen.

669
01:24:17,676 --> 01:24:21,043
They put all the crazy people here
and left them here to die.

670
01:24:24,183 --> 01:24:26,743
- My God!
- That's where it is.

671
01:24:26,819 --> 01:24:28,650
What the hell
are you talking about?

672
01:24:30,957 --> 01:24:33,289
There are people buried here.

673
01:24:38,798 --> 01:24:42,131
Easy. Easy.

674
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:43,864
Easy, there.

675
01:25:00,822 --> 01:25:02,289
What the hell are you doing?

676
01:25:04,693 --> 01:25:07,787
- What is the matter with you?
- Don't you understand?

677
01:25:07,863 --> 01:25:10,765
It has to be done.
That is where the room is.

678
01:25:10,833 --> 01:25:12,391
What are you doing
to my house?

679
01:25:12,468 --> 01:25:14,459
I'm sorry.
I don't know what got into her.

680
01:25:14,537 --> 01:25:16,835
I'm trying to tell him
that's where it is.

681
01:25:28,819 --> 01:25:30,411
She's right.

682
01:25:31,488 --> 01:25:33,547
There is something here.

683
01:25:37,896 --> 01:25:39,056
Give me that.

684
01:26:03,756 --> 01:26:05,247
What's going on?

685
01:26:06,593 --> 01:26:07,753
Have you all gone mad?

686
01:26:33,122 --> 01:26:36,455
They... come
and go through here.

687
01:26:48,672 --> 01:26:51,266
Find the well.

688
01:26:53,143 --> 01:26:57,580
It's the passage...
to hell!

689
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,785
Cover it!

690
01:27:48,369 --> 01:27:49,529
Hello?

691
01:28:07,823 --> 01:28:09,620
George, you heard that voice.

692
01:28:10,626 --> 01:28:12,753
You know whose voice that was.

693
01:28:14,530 --> 01:28:16,964
You heard it.
I know you heard it!

694
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:26,773
We have to do something, George.

695
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:29,175
We have to do something now.

696
01:29:13,894 --> 01:29:16,362
Peace to this house
and all who enter here.

697
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:20,264
Forgive us our sins
and save us from all illness.

698
01:29:20,334 --> 01:29:23,098
Grant this
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

699
01:29:32,514 --> 01:29:34,209
What is going on here?

700
01:29:38,653 --> 01:29:40,281
Weird people.

701
01:29:56,707 --> 01:29:58,902
Bless this house
and all who enter here.

702
01:29:58,976 --> 01:30:01,069
Bless this house...

703
01:30:02,379 --> 01:30:04,347
What's happening?

704
01:30:17,462 --> 01:30:18,895
Don't touch me!

705
01:30:18,963 --> 01:30:21,899
Leave me alone, please.

706
01:30:24,803 --> 01:30:26,361
Please.

707
01:30:42,689 --> 01:30:44,850
Father, since I've come back
from Vietnam,

708
01:30:44,925 --> 01:30:47,417
you've had
a tremendous influence in my life.

709
01:30:48,796 --> 01:30:52,095
I look up to you.
I respect you, I admire you.

710
01:30:52,166 --> 01:30:53,758
And what is your point?

711
01:30:55,536 --> 01:30:59,564
I believe that...
that I know about fear.

712
01:30:59,641 --> 01:31:03,133
I've seen it.
I've experienced it.

713
01:31:05,247 --> 01:31:08,842
I wish you'd make your point.
I've got a lot of things to do.

714
01:31:08,917 --> 01:31:13,082
My point is I believe we create
our own demons in our own minds.

715
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:18,720
I'm sorry, Father.

716
01:31:41,753 --> 01:31:46,087
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

717
01:31:52,397 --> 01:31:53,888
Let us pray.

718
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:09,145
Father...

719
01:32:10,984 --> 01:32:16,581
by the power of Your spirit...
You have filled the hearts...

720
01:32:17,958 --> 01:32:19,687
of Your faithful people...

721
01:32:21,029 --> 01:32:25,728
with gifts of love...
for one another.

722
01:32:28,002 --> 01:32:31,267
Hear the prayers that we offer
for our relatives and friends.

723
01:32:33,241 --> 01:32:34,937
Give them health.

724
01:32:35,811 --> 01:32:39,804
Give them health
of mind and body that...

725
01:32:43,485 --> 01:32:45,385
Give them health
of mind and body

726
01:32:45,454 --> 01:32:47,980
that they may do Your will
with perfect love.

727
01:32:50,627 --> 01:32:52,993
Give them health
of mind and body

728
01:32:53,063 --> 01:32:56,157
that they may do Your will
with perfect love!

729
01:32:56,232 --> 01:32:59,599
We ask this through
our Lord, Jesus Christ, Your Son!

730
01:33:01,572 --> 01:33:04,006
Give them strength
of mind and body!

731
01:33:04,075 --> 01:33:06,373
Oh, Lord...

732
01:33:06,444 --> 01:33:08,412
I beg Thee!

733
01:33:08,479 --> 01:33:09,639
Give them strength

734
01:33:09,714 --> 01:33:14,675
in the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ, Your Son!

735
01:33:14,753 --> 01:33:16,277
Oh, Lord!

736
01:33:18,023 --> 01:33:20,184
Oh, Jesus Christ!

737
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:34,872
Richard.

738
01:33:38,044 --> 01:33:39,671
What is it, Father?

739
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:44,648
I can't see.

740
01:33:51,458 --> 01:33:53,187
I'm blind.

741
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,506
What do you want from us?

742
01:35:20,387 --> 01:35:22,719
Goddammit!
This is my house!

743
01:36:20,184 --> 01:36:22,380
No!

744
01:37:06,601 --> 01:37:08,296
Oh, no.

745
01:37:13,175 --> 01:37:15,109
I'm coming apart!

746
01:37:15,177 --> 01:37:18,875
Oh, Mother of God,
I'm coming apart!

747
01:37:26,990 --> 01:37:28,548
What happened?

748
01:37:29,526 --> 01:37:32,222
I was just dreaming.

749
01:37:32,296 --> 01:37:34,127
I'm sorry if I woke you.

750
01:37:34,198 --> 01:37:37,190
Honey, are you okay?

751
01:37:37,267 --> 01:37:39,030
Oh, sure.

752
01:37:39,103 --> 01:37:40,502
Are you sure?

753
01:37:46,044 --> 01:37:48,808
Oh, my God,
what happened to your foot?

754
01:37:51,883 --> 01:37:53,851
Look.

755
01:37:53,918 --> 01:37:57,116
Nothing.
I just tripped.

756
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:04,560
- It looks like teeth marks.
- Will you stop nagging at me?

757
01:38:05,564 --> 01:38:07,759
It's always so cold in here.

758
01:38:11,204 --> 01:38:13,195
Let's get out of here, huh?

759
01:38:13,273 --> 01:38:15,673
Let's just
pack up our stuff and go.

760
01:38:18,879 --> 01:38:22,280
Would you please leave that
damn fire alone and listen to me?

761
01:38:22,349 --> 01:38:24,147
I'm not going anywhere!

762
01:38:24,218 --> 01:38:27,244
You're the one that wanted a house.
This is it, so just shut up!

763
01:38:28,356 --> 01:38:30,187
You bastard!

764
01:39:06,495 --> 01:39:09,191
Excuse me. Somebody told me
you could tell me where...

765
01:39:09,264 --> 01:39:10,526
Excuse me.

766
01:39:11,634 --> 01:39:13,534
Someone told me that...

767
01:39:13,602 --> 01:39:16,834
I'm Kathy Lutz, and I'm
looking for Father Delaney.

768
01:39:19,142 --> 01:39:20,871
Hi, I'm Father Bolen.

769
01:39:21,845 --> 01:39:24,211
I believe the Father
has gone on vacation.

770
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:26,043
He's been very overworked...

771
01:39:26,116 --> 01:39:29,574
I must speak to Father Delaney.
I simply must.

772
01:39:31,689 --> 01:39:34,590
You don't understand.
He's more than a priest to me.

773
01:39:34,659 --> 01:39:37,253
He's like a friend of mine.

774
01:39:37,328 --> 01:39:39,990
He's helped me through
some very difficult times,

775
01:39:40,064 --> 01:39:42,123
and I have to
talk to him now.

776
01:39:44,503 --> 01:39:46,733
It's out of my hands.

777
01:41:14,398 --> 01:41:15,888
Hello, Father.

778
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:19,833
How are you feeling today?

779
01:41:30,415 --> 01:41:33,510
I brought you some mail.
Would you like me to read it?

780
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:42,854
I notice there's one here
from a former patient.

781
01:41:42,929 --> 01:41:44,420
Would you like to hear it?

782
01:41:54,909 --> 01:41:57,434
It certainly is beautiful here.

783
01:42:01,116 --> 01:42:03,710
Why don't I arrange
so we can have our lunch here?

784
01:42:03,785 --> 01:42:05,650
Would you like that, Father?

785
01:42:45,063 --> 01:42:48,089
Excuse me, Father.
Can I have a word with you?

786
01:42:50,268 --> 01:42:53,670
Of course, Sergeant.
What can I do for you?

787
01:42:53,739 --> 01:42:58,005
Well...
I don't really know exactly.

788
01:42:58,077 --> 01:43:01,638
It may be just a wild-goose chase,
but I'm the curious type.

789
01:43:01,714 --> 01:43:04,182
Like the man says,
it goes with the territory.

790
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:06,185
I have a great deal
of work to do.

791
01:43:06,253 --> 01:43:08,448
Could you
make your point, please?

792
01:43:08,521 --> 01:43:10,853
What's happening
to Father Delaney?

793
01:43:11,825 --> 01:43:14,885
He's an old friend,
and I can't get the story right.

794
01:43:14,961 --> 01:43:17,020
There's no "story" to get right.

795
01:43:19,567 --> 01:43:21,899
Maybe I am
just chasing shadows.

796
01:43:22,770 --> 01:43:24,499
If you could excuse me, please.

797
01:43:56,606 --> 01:43:58,939
I think this has
all the good stuff.

798
01:43:59,009 --> 01:44:00,840
I mean the major coverage.

799
01:44:00,911 --> 01:44:02,970
If there's anything else
you want to see,

800
01:44:03,047 --> 01:44:05,709
- I'll go and get it.
- No, I think this should be fine.

801
01:44:05,783 --> 01:44:09,583
This is the November 14th issue,
the day after the murders.

802
01:44:09,653 --> 01:44:11,587
You turn that crank...

803
01:44:11,655 --> 01:44:13,317
- That one there?
- Right there.

804
01:44:13,391 --> 01:44:16,485
It advances the film.
Each frame is a whole page.

805
01:44:16,561 --> 01:44:19,621
To get it in focus,
you just turn this knob right here.

806
01:44:19,698 --> 01:44:21,825
- I've got it.
- You all set now?

807
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:22,924
- I'm fine.
- Good.

808
01:44:48,762 --> 01:44:51,697
Oh, my God, George.

809
01:47:05,642 --> 01:47:10,205
Matt! Greg! Matt!

810
01:48:08,944 --> 01:48:10,275
Amy!

811
01:49:12,312 --> 01:49:13,904
Don't hurt my babies.

812
01:49:16,783 --> 01:49:17,943
Jesus.

813
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:29,095
I saw your picture
in the newspaper.

814
01:49:34,703 --> 01:49:37,069
Kathy, I wouldn't hurt you.

815
01:50:11,141 --> 01:50:13,473
Get going!
Now! Get going!

816
01:50:21,286 --> 01:50:22,412
Hold on!

817
01:50:29,829 --> 01:50:31,456
Go!

818
01:50:44,544 --> 01:50:46,512
Here, let me try.

819
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:49,208
- I got it.
- I can't open it!

820
01:50:55,857 --> 01:50:57,017
Go! Go!

821
01:50:58,693 --> 01:51:00,024
Mom!

822
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:19,675
The keys...

823
01:51:19,748 --> 01:51:22,684
Oh, God! Where are the keys?

824
01:51:22,752 --> 01:51:24,151
What? Wait a minute.

825
01:51:27,690 --> 01:51:29,282
I can't find them.

826
01:51:35,433 --> 01:51:37,162
I want Harry!

827
01:51:38,235 --> 01:51:40,294
- Please, George, drive.
- Mom.

828
01:52:05,398 --> 01:52:09,300
George, no! No!

829
01:52:27,588 --> 01:52:29,784
Harry! Come on, boy!

830
01:52:52,581 --> 01:52:54,048
Harry, come on!

831
01:53:41,467 --> 01:53:42,627
No, it's me!

832
01:53:48,241 --> 01:53:49,800
Harry, no!

833
01:54:00,220 --> 01:54:02,313
Pull! Pull!

834
01:54:08,563 --> 01:54:10,622
Harry, pull!

835
01:54:25,348 --> 01:54:26,781
Good boy.

836
01:54:50,908 --> 01:54:52,398
Come on, boy!

837
01:55:30,217 --> 01:55:33,584
Thank God.
Oh, thank God.
