I was back there thinking,

475
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:23,375
"What causes glasses
to slip on and off?"

476
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,311
And it's because when
you take them on and off,

477
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,980
you're always putting pressure
on the frames like this.

478
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,348
It causes 'em to spread.

479
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:33,451
So I put a little handle
right here in the center,

480
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:36,087
and it puts the pressure on
the bridge where it belongs,

481
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:38,523
just like the tie rods
on a '72 Buick.

482
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,759
Plus, I put a little
nose break on them here

483
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,704
to prevent slippage. Try it.

484
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,529

00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,954
Okay, you move it out.

539
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,364
[Engine starting]

540
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:05,897
(Navin)
So, Mom, when I told
Mr. Hartounian I'd come back,

541
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:08,766
he said "Don't be a putz.
See the world.

542
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,472
Me, you've seen already."

543
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,905
I took his advice and got
a job with SJM Fiesta Shows

544
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,206
as a weight guesser.

545
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,708
Frosty, my boss, told me

546
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,344
there's a big future
in weight guessing.

547
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:22,848
Enclosed is $4.75
for my loving family.

548
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,258
P.S. Is Grandma still fartin'?

549
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,253
(Navin)
For $1,

550
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,359
I'll guess your weight,
your height, or your sex.

551
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:34,492
The most exciting thing
on the midway.

552
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,827
Imagine the thrill

553
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:39,163
of getting your weight guessed
by a professional.

554
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:42,200
You can blow up your cheeks,
you can stick out your chest,

555
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,003
but you're not going
to fool the guesser.

556
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,205
How about you, sir?
Step right up.

557
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,240
Honey, let's see
how good this guy is.

558
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,980
Now, what do I win?

559
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,853
Uh, anything in this
general area, right in here.

560
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,982
Anything below the stereo,

561
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:00,351
and on this side
of the bicentennial glasses.

562
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:04,230
Anything between
the ashtrays and the thimble.

563
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,091
Anything in these
three inches.

564
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,826
Right in here, in this area,

565
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:11,596
that includes the Chiclets
but not the erasers.

566
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,531
No, sir. Come on, honey.

567
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,635
He thought
he had himself a rube.

568
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:21,139
Frosty, I am just
no good at this.

569
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,207
Oh, come on, Navin,
you're doing fine.

570
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,476
No, I've already given away
eight pencils,

571
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,145
two hula dolls,
and an ashtray,

572
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,386
and I've only taken in $15.

573
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:32,483
Navin, you have taken in $15

574
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:35,259
and given away 50 cents'
worth of crap.

575
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,857
Which gives us
a net profit of $14.50.

576
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:41,992
Ah!

577
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,102
It's a profit deal.

578
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,272
[Chuckles]

579
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,240
That takes the pressure off.

580
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,839
Get your weight guessed
right here.

581
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,307
Only $1.

582
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,009
Actual live weight guessing.

583
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,244
Take a chance
and win some crap.

584
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:01,612
Step right up.

585
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:06,017
(male announcer)
Ladies and gentlemen,
I draw your attention now

586
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,920
to the left side
of our midway,

587
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,095
presenting the amazing
Patty Bernstein

588
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:19,230
doing her special ride through
the Flaming Wall of Death.

589
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,004
[People cheering]

590
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,005
[Crowd whistling]

[Belching]

592
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,504
Wanna guess my weight,
greenie?

593
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,134
I saw you last night.
You were great.

594
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:31,536
Yeah, right.

595
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,707
Turn around.

596
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,809
What?

597
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,382
Turn around.

598
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,455
Go like this.

599
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,324
You're okay.

600
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,662
Give me a bite
of that corn dog.

601
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,623
What about germs?

602
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,028
Put a rubber on it.

603
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,465
Get on.

604
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,702
(Frosty)
Don't you wear him out.

605
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:06,203
He's got to work tonight.

606
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,415
What a great place.

607
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,154
[Burping]

608
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,118
You know, you can tell
so much about a person

609
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,552
from the way they live.

610
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:22,987
Just looking around here,

611
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:26,024
I can tell you're
a genuinely dirty person.

612
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,371
What do I do with this?

613
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,276
Oh, you keep it there.

614
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,276
[Sighing]

615
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:43,181
Where's your garbage?

616
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,417
Do you know
what I'd like to do?

617
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:54,520
What?

618
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,221
Guess your weight.

619
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,223
Hey, that would be
interesting for me.

620
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,559
No one has tried
to guess my weight.

621
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,628
You see, I guess
their weights. It'd be sort...

622
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:04,834
Put your arms up.

623
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,769
This will give me
a whole different
perspective on this.

(Navin)
Hey, you're really
trying to be accurate.

625
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,517

00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,920
Wait a minute!

628
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,022
What's happening
to my special purpose?

629
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,390
What's your
"special purpose"?

630
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,691
Well, when I was a kid,

631
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,227
my mom told me
that was my special purpose

632
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:39,130
and someday I'd find out
what that special purpose was.

633
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,798

649
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,857
And he's got the kisses here.

650
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,589
That Patty
must be a sweet girl.

651
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,090
God bless her.

(Navin)
Do you ever think
we'll get to know each other

655
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,889
well enough to kiss?

(Patty)
We don't have to.
You're my man.

Gosh!

You have my last name tattooed
right there under the "J's."

First I get my name
in the phone book,

and now I'm on your ass.

see that than the phone book.

Woo-woo!

670
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,509
Have you seen
a 5-year-old boy, blond hair,

671
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,145
and he's wearing a T-shirt
that says "Bullshit" on it?

672
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,314
No. There was
just one kid earlier,

673
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,750
had a T-shirt that said
"Life sucks" on it.

674
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,418
We got off the roundup
and he said

675
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,020
he wanted to go on the trains.

676
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,189
Well, I don't think...
There he is. Billy!

come on off that train!

Billy!

682
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,473
And take my keys.
And hold my wallet.

00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,302
Okay.

684
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,304
Don't touch the Johnson bar.

685
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,872
You'll explode
the fuel casing.

686
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:37,541
And if the Wilson-Smith
indicator gets above 160,

687
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,809
just turn that little...

688
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,178
Billy, I can't take you
anywhere anymore!

689
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,713
There's a little
screwdriver there.

690
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,715
Just put it in,
turn it one-quarter.

691
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,317
We're going
into the tunnel.

692
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:49,186
Don't stand up
because the clearance
is only four foot...

693
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,528
Oh, no!

694
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:53,657
I'm okay.
I was protected by the bill
of my Engineer Fred cap.

696
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,979
Thanks for
pulling my cap down.

Oh, Billy.

698
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,215
Billy, you scared me
half to death.

699
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,884
Thank you so much.

700
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:23,220
It would have been
so embarrassing to go home
without Billy.

701
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,891
Oh, here's your gloves
and your oil can

702
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:30,031
and your wallet.
Oh, and this fell out.

703
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,538
[Exclaiming]

704
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:35,134
Those guys.

705
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,770
Listen, what you did just now
was very brave.

706
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,141
Is there some way
I could repay you?

707
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,041
Repay me?

708
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,110
I could never accept
anything from you

709
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,511
for saving your child.

710
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:49,388
Oh, he's not my child.

711
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,717
I'm just babysitting
for a friend.

712
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:54,756
Oh! Would it be too much
if I asked for a kiss?

713
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:55,987
No.

714
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,460
He's a real little dickens.

715
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,003
Thank you.

716
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,246
Oh, Miss?

717
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:21,181
I was... I was just
standing here right now and

718
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:24,825
I was wondering if you weren't
doing anything tomorrow

719
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:30,727
that maybe you might wanna
go out or...

720
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,326
What?

721
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:39,339
[Babbling]
I thought maybe you might
wanna go out with me.

722
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,608
Are you trying to ask me
for a date?

723
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:44,874
Well...

724
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,809
Once for no, twice for yes.

725
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:53,310
Okay.

726
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,753
Um, you're so cute.

727
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,751
How about 3:30 tomorrow
at the roundup?

728
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,059
Okay.

729
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:06,965
Do you have
any boyfriends?

730
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:10,060
Not really.

731
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,562
Are they crazy?

732
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,231
If I was a fella,
I'd be around all the time.

733
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:16,404
Well, see if you can
work it out.

734
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,336
We have a date tomorrow.

735
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:21,983
What's your name?

736
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,377
Marie.

737
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,111
What's yours?

738
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,812
I'll tell you tomorrow.

739
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:31,792
It'll give us something
interesting to talk about.

740
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,407
Hi.

741
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,274
What's up, hubby?

742
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,012
I got these for you.

743
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,218
Thanks.

744
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:04,281
Navin, you know the other day
when I showed you the tattoo?

745
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:05,521
Yeah. Yeah.

746
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,218
Well, I forgot
to tell you somethin'.

747
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,787
Oh, really? What?

748
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,129
This.

749
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,763
And that's
what's gonna happen to you

750
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,266
if I ever catch you looking
at another broad.

751
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,867
I'm glad you told me.

752
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:27,712
And remember,
I did this without anger.

753
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,780
And I stayed away
from your crotch.

754
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,214
Bye, sweetie.

755
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,886
Hi.

756
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:39,422
What happened?

757
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:42,886
Oh, it was unbelievable.
These guys jumped me.

758
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,521
Tried to get these flowers.

759
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:45,990
I got 'em for you.

760
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,470
It's kind of
a traditional date deal.

761
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,996
Yeah, I've heard of that.
What were they?

762
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:54,971
Uh, couple of dozen roses.

763
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,735
Look like daisy stems.

764
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,169
What?

765
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,205
That guy gypped me.

766
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,907
He put... put daisy stems
on my roses.

767
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,242
[Laughing]

768
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:07,478
Hey, look,
these hoodlums are dangerous.

769
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,981
I think we ought to get out
of here before she sees us.

770
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,082
She?

771
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:13,150
What?

772
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,551
You said "she."

773
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:17,588
No. No.
I always call a gang "she."

774
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,857
It's like
when you call a boat "she,"

775
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,659
or... or a hurricane "she."

776
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,001
Or a girl?

777
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,195
A girl.
You can call a girl "she."

778
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:28,039
That's just one of the many
things you can call "she."

779
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,834
[Men chattering]

780
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,608
(Marie)
Why are you smiling?

781
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:36,384
(Navin)
You're the first person
I've ever had in my place.

782
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,376
Do you live here?
Oh, it's nice.

783
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,178
So, did you decorate it?

784
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,313
I got all this stuff from
the old Cup O' Pizza place

785
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,156
before they tore it down.

786
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,754
That was really good pizza.

787
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:52,756
Oh, this is the best
pizza in a cup ever.

788
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:54,358
This guy's unbelievable.

789
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,560
He ran the old Cup O' Pizza
guy out of business.

790
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,661
Really?

791
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:00,107
People come from all over
to get this. Uh-huh.

792
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:03,333
[Sighing]

793
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:16,055
You know,
you have beautiful skin.

794
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:20,523
May I?

795
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,387
Yes.

796
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,366
So smooth and flexible.

797
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:33,397
I take after my mother's side
of the family.

798
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:37,345
It's amazing the way it just
snaps back like that. Amazing.

799
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,404
Are you a model?

800
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,439
No.

801
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:45,548
I'm a cosmetologist.

802
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:48,680
Really? A cosmetologist?

803
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:53,351
That's unbelievable.
That's impressive.

804
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,023
It must be tough to handle
the weightlessness.

805
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,434
Can I ask you
a personal question?

806
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,969
What is it?

807
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:07,740
Now be totally honest.

808
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:11,045
You do have a boyfriend,
don't you?

809
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,044
Kind of.

810
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:17,245
I know this is our first date

811
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:20,981
but do you think

812
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:24,157
the next time you make love
to your boyfriend,

813
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,886
you could think of me?

814
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,421
Well, I haven't
made love to him yet.

815
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,295
That's too bad.

816
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:35,259
Do you think
it's possible that some day

817
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,830
you could make love with me
and think of him?

818
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,172
Who knows?

819
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:44,471
Maybe you and he can make love
and you could think of me.

820
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,943
I'd just be happy
to be in there somewhere.

821
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,224
Do you have a girlfriend?

822
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,525
Does it matter?

823
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:11,028
Well, I'd like to think
you were available.

824
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:12,965
Oh, I'm available.

825
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,009
Did you forget
about my ass?

826
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,545
No! No, I've been
thinking about it.

827
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:30,814
She tattooed my name
on her ass.

828
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,953
Not just my name,
a lot of names.

829
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,818
And funny sayings, too.

830
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:37,588
She's got one up there that
says, "Slippery when wet."

831
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,889
How do you know that?

832
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,891
What is she?
Some great piece of ass?

833
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:42,700
She's no great piece of ass.

834
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:44,862
I mean, uh...

835
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,231
Hey, wait... wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

836
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:50,100
We're all adults here.
Let's reason this out.

837
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,836
Now Marie is the type
of person that if you gotta...

838
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:55,339
If this gash doesn't
get her buns out of here,

839
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,741
I am gonna drive this bike
up her butt!

840
00:47:57,741 --> 00:47:59,720
While Patty
tends to be more direct.

841
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:01,311
As for you, farm boy,

842
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:02,579
[grunts]

843
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:03,750
We're married!

844
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,092
And as for you,
kewpie doll...

845
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:10,888
You protected me!

846
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,867
You must really like me.

847
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:22,969
(Navin and Marie)
I know, I know, you belong

848
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:28,209
To somebody new

849
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,375
But tonight

850
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:35,721
You belong to me

851
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:44,531
Although,
although we're apart

852
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:49,770
You're a part of my heart

853
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,603
And tonight

854
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:57,137
You belong to me

855
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:03,281
Way down

856
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:05,619
By the stream

857
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,551
How sweet

858
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,983
It will seem

859
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:16,155
Once more, just to dream

860
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:19,356
In the moonlight

861
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:24,828
My Honey, I know, I know

862
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:27,240
With the dawn

863
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:30,133
That you

864
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,306
Will be gone

865
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:34,878
But tonight

866
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:39,287
You belong to me

867
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:42,012
Just to little old me

868
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,621
[playing]

869
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:14,853
You know,

870
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,281
while you were
playing that just now,

871
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:19,916
[waves breaking]

872
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:22,419
I had the craziest
fantasy that I could

873
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,655
rise up.

874
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:29,000
Float right down
the end of this cornet.

875
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:31,662
Right through here.

876
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,537
Through these valves,

877
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:36,409
right along this tube,

878
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:39,573
come right up
against your lips,

879
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:41,880
and give you a kiss.

880
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,649
Why didn't you?

881
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,951
I didn't want to get
spit on me.

882
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:34,695
[Grunting]

883
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:39,170
[Both panting]

884
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,442
Was it good for you, too?

885
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:50,077
I really do want to kiss you.

886
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:54,016
But I'm afraid.

887
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:56,813
I would've kept
my tongue in.

888
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,257
No, I mean,

889
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:03,030
I'm afraid if I kiss you,

890
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:06,829
I'll fall in love with you.

891
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:09,428
You will?

892
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,269
And I don't want to.

893
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:14,667
You don't?

894
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,435
My mother
sacrificed everything

895
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,812
to send me through
cosmetology school.

896
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:22,340
She did?

897
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:26,646
She has this dream
for me to be something.

898
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:28,579
She does?

899
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:33,191
To marry someone with power,

900
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:35,889
money, vision.

901
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:40,199
Someone with
a special purpose.

902
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,937
I've got one!

903
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,131
I've got a special purpose!

904
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:49,432
You do?

905
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:51,601
[Exclaiming]
Yes, it's fantastic!

906
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:54,479
It's great!
It's unbelievable!

907
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:56,940
And I was afraid
to tell you about it!

908
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,817
Your mother's gonna love me!

909
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,949
Marie, are you awake?

910
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:07,151
Good.

911
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,525
You look so beautiful
and peaceful,

912
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,598
you almost look dead.

913
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,061
And I'm glad because

914
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:21,097
there's something
I wanna say that's
always been very difficult

915
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:22,803
for me to say.

916
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,936
I slit the sheet,
the sheet I slit,

917
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:27,676
and on the slitted sheet
I sit.

918
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,008
I've never been
relaxed enough

919
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:34,249
around anyone
to be able to say that.

920
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:37,415
You give me confidence
in myself.

921
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:41,117
I know we've only known
each other

922
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:43,096
for four weeks
and three days,

923
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,793
but to me

924
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:47,634
it seems like
nine weeks and five days.

925
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:51,765
The first day
seemed like a week.

926
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,842
And the second day
seemed like five days.

927
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,140
And the third day
seemed like a week again.

928
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:02,749
And the fourth day
seemed like eight days.

929
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:06,549
But the fifth day,
you went to see your mother.

930
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:09,121
And that seemed
just like a day.

931
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:12,819
But then you
came back and later

932
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:16,629
on the sixth day,
in the evening,
when we saw each other,

933
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:20,332
that started seeming
like two days.

934
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:22,692
So in the evening,
it seemed like

935
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,995
two days spilling over
into the next day.

936
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:27,163
And that started
seeming like four days.

937
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:29,404
So at the end
of the sixth day,

938
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:33,213
on into the seventh day,
it seemed like
a total of five days.

939
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:37,545
And the sixth day
seemed like

940
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:39,812
a week and a half.

941
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:42,412
I have it written down

942
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:45,654
but I can... I can show it
to you tomorrow
if you wanna see it.

943
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:50,459
Anyway,
I've decided that tomorrow,

944
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:52,958
when the time is right,

945
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:55,995
I'm gonna ask
you to marry me.

946
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,501
If that's okay with you.

947
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,010
Just don't say anything.

948
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:09,507
You've made me very happy.

949
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:22,419
Oh, I'll see you again

950
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:26,662
Whenever spring
breaks through again

951
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:29,294
(Navin)
Honey, sing!

952
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:35,098
Time may lie heavy between

953
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:36,804
But what has been

954
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:40,880
Is past forgetting

955
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:45,608
This sweet memory

956
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:48,278
Across the years,
will come

957
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:50,146
[Marie playing cornet]

958
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,886
To me

959
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:54,150
Though my world

960
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:56,892
May go awry

961
00:55:57,153 --> 00:56:00,056
In my heart

962
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:02,331
Will ever lie

963
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:06,805
Just the echo of a sigh

964
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:12,642
Goodbye

965
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:17,116
(Navin)
Honey, who's the happiest guy
in the world?

966
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:20,048
You are.

967
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:22,011
That's right.

968
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:24,388
And who's the happiest gal?

969
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:26,658
[Shithead yelping]

970
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:28,451
That's right.

971
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:30,053
(Navin)
Honey, guess what?

972
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,089
I wrote a song
for you this morning.

973
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:36,299
Oh, I'm picking out
a thermos for you

974
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:40,731
Not an ordinary
thermos for you

975
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:44,872
But the extra-best thermos
you can buy

976
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:48,413
With vinyl and stripes
and a cup built right in

977
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:52,311
I'm picking out a thermos
for you

978
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:55,813
And maybe a barometer, too

979
00:56:56,146 --> 00:57:00,025
And what else can I buy
so on me you'll rely

980
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:02,660
A rear-end
thermometer, too

981
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:04,194
(Navin)
Honey?

982
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:06,857
There's a question
I've been wanting to pop,

983
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:09,227
but I've been
afraid you'd say no.

984
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,695
But this seems like
the right time and place.

985
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:14,037
So here goes.

986
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,037
Honey, will you marry me?

987
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,610
[Barking]

988
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:21,838
Yahoo!

989
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,113
Come on,
let's seal it with a kiss!

990
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,012
Get in the tub with me!

991
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:30,081
Not you, Shithead!
Where's Marie?

992
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:31,514
[Shithead barking]

993
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,015
What letter?

994
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,562
"Dear Navin."

995
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:44,405
[Gibbering]

996
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:49,874
...to tell...

997
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,644
...to be...

[gibbering]

999
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,911
Marie! Marie!

1000
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:04,214
[Shithead barking]
(Navin)
Shithead, come here.

1001
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,615
Good idea.

1002
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:08,618
Marie! Marie,
why did you leave me?

1003
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:11,155
I couldn't read the letter.
It was too blurry.

1004
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:13,594
Marie! Marie!

1005
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,458
[Growling]
Here, boy.

1006
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:21,297
Marie! Marie!

1007
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:23,501
Where are you, Marie?

1008
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:30,440
Marie! Marie!

1009
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,595
This is not gonna be easy,
Shithead.

1010
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:46,228
We've been together
a long time.

1011
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:49,026
But I gotta head down
that road.

1012
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:52,395
And there'll be times
out there

1013
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:54,875
when there won't be
enough food for two.

1014
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:56,733
And I won't be able to...

1015
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:58,635
Hey, wait a minute!

1016
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:00,336
I-I'm not done yet!

1017
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:02,305
Come back.
I'm not finished.

1018
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:04,250
I have some more
to tell you.

1019
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:09,679
You'll find a family
who can give you a real home,

1020
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:12,659
with loving kids
and a warm fireplace.

1021
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:15,385
I never liked you, anyway.

1022
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,262
Now get out of here!

1023
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,164
Okay! Okay!
You win. You can go with me.

1024
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:26,629
(Navin)
So, Mom,

1025
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:29,006
with my faithful dog
leading the way,

1026
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,740
I'm out to win
the hand of Marie.

1027
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:35,077
You'd love her, Ma.
She looks just like you.

1028
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,346
Except she's white and blond.

1029
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:41,711
So, to win her back,
I vowed to make
something of myself.

1030
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:44,614
I settled in Los Angeles
and took the money I saved

1031
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:46,749
and rented my
first apartment.

1032
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,451
"I haven't heard from Marie.

1034
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,020
"Things couldn't be worse.

1035
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,556
I can only send you
49 cents this week..."

1036
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:55,124
Oh, bless his heart.

1037
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:56,659
That's a good boy.

1038
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,763
"...as I've lost all my jobs.

00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:01,230

eating well, though.

I ate there all week.

1043
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:11,874
A pint of blood?

to sign for this.

I have to sign
before you shoot me?

1062

I'm not gonna shoot you.

1063
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:06,756
Why not?

1064
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:08,132
That was the old me.

1065
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:10,631
I was a little mixed-up
at that time.

1066
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:14,235
Had a bad marriage
and I just gave up smoking.

1067
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:16,501
I'm okay now.

1068
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,645
I'm a private detective.

There. Now, we are complete.

1160
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:25,041

we can go pick out

follow me this way

bring out his lips.

just wonderfully.

We are now going
to peel off our Mask-O Derm.

1179
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:09,689
Irving's skin will
be tighter, firmer,

1180
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:12,054
and he'll look like
a different man.

1181
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:13,430
You'll be amazed.

1182
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:16,027

01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:20,317
You got the bamboo umbrella
and everything.

1247
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:26,289
See that? Be somebody.

1248
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:31,790
Very good, sir.
Very good.

1249
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:34,757
Oh, uh,

1250
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:37,396
there are some charity people
here to see you, sir.

1251
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:40,003
No! Send them away!

1252
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:43,032
There's a lot of people
more deserving than me.

1253
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:45,637
Ah, but these people
want you to give.

1254
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:48,771
Oh.

1255
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:51,708
Okay.

1256
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:54,977
My name is
Father Carlos Las
Vegas De Cordoba.

1257
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,284
Father, you seem
like a religious man.

1258
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:00,422
How can I help you?

1259
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:02,890
By giving me three minutes
of your time

1260
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:04,820
so that you can see some film

1261
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:07,596
of a great ugliness
that is spreading
in my country.

1262
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:11,400
Oh, God.
I'll bet it's disgusting.

1263
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:13,762
Hobart?

1264
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:14,863
Yes, sir?

1265
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:17,099
Are you over your grief
enough yet to dim the lights?

1266
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:18,701
[Chuckling]
Of course, sir.

1267
01:12:18,701 --> 01:12:20,737
Well, one can't mourn forever.

1268
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:24,077
You will not believe
what you are about to see.

1269
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:27,512
That human beings
could have sunk so low

1270
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,778
that they can take
pleasure to do this

1271
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:31,714
to another
of God's creatures.

1272
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:33,853
I hope you have
a strong stomach, senor.

1273
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:35,893
Roll the ugliness.

1274
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:38,364
[Men yelling]

1275
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:47,804
[All cheering]

1276
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,383
[Kittens purring]

1277
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:16,525
Good Lord.

1278
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:18,971
I've heard about
this cat juggling.

1279
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:22,071
[Men hooting]

1280
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:41,092
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!

1281
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:44,053
Good.

1282
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:49,295
Father, could there be a God
that would let this happen?

1283
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:52,296
How much do you want?

1284
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:56,173
(man)
If your initial investment
is $500,000,

1285
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:58,771
and your apartments
are up in March,

1286
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:01,570
you should have
"X" amount of dollars

1287
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:03,806
rolling in
by the end of this year.

1288
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:06,875
(Navin)
Ah! "X" amount.
That's very good, isn't it?

1289
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:08,811
(Man #2)
Not only that,
you can depreciate

1290
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:10,746
the entire building
for the full amount.

1291
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:13,351
(Navin)
Depreciate? Very good.
Hmm. I like that.

1292
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:16,685
We found a way
to get around
this Fair Housing crap.

1293
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:19,529
Ah! Good.
Getting around the crap.
That's good.

1294
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:23,959
By keeping the rents high,
we're going to appeal to
a select class of people.

1295
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,961
Select class.
Very, very good.

1296
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:29,064
We'll keep the eggplants out.

1297
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:31,767
Ah, good.
We don't want any vegetables.

1298
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:34,136
No, no.
The jungle bunnies.

1299
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:36,240
Of course.
They'll eat the vegetables.

1300
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,312
Boss?
Can I... can I talk to him?

1301
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:42,078
We're gonna keep out
the niggers.

1302
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:44,079
The what?

1303
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:46,281
The niggers.
We'll keep 'em out.

1304
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:47,382
Yeah.

1305
01:14:47,382 --> 01:14:51,330
Sir, you are talking
to a nigger!

1306
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:56,300
[Screaming]

1307
01:14:56,859 --> 01:15:03,573
[Grunting]

1308
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:15,716
[Groaning]

1309
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,335
[Screaming]

1310
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:36,740
[Groaning]

1311
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,976
(Marie)
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1312
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:43,879
How could you know
that was Iron Balls McGinty?

1313
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:46,575
Your escargots. Salad.

1314
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:48,213
[People chattering]

1315
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:51,380
Would monsieur care
for another bottle
of the Chateau Latour?

1316
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:54,850
Ah, yes, but no more 1966.
Let's splurge.

1317
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:56,852
Bring us some fresh wine.

1318
01:15:56,852 --> 01:15:58,186
The freshest you've got.

1319
01:15:58,186 --> 01:16:00,791
This year's.
No more of this old stuff.

1320
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:03,265
Oui, monsieur.

1321
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:06,963
He doesn't realize
he's dealing with
sophisticated people here.

1322
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:10,232
Marie, now just stay calm.
Stay calm.

1323
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:11,533
(Navin)
Just don't look down.

1324
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:13,268
Don't look down!
Look up!

1325
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:16,112
Just keep your eyes up
and keep them that way, okay?
Waiter!

1326
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:21,743
There are snails
on her plate.

1327
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:23,313
[Squealing]

1328
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:26,715
Now get them out of here
before she sees them.

1329
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:29,525
Look away! Just look away!
And keep your eyes that way!

1330
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:32,854
You'd think at
a fancy restaurant like this,
at these prices,

1331
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:35,698
you would be able
to keep the snails
off the food!

1332
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:39,027
There're so many snails
in there, you can't even
see the food!

1333
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:40,429
Now take them away
and bring me

1334
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:43,332
those melted cheese
sandwich appetizers
you talked me out of!

1335
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:44,776
Oui, monsieur.

1336
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:47,436
Do you believe this?

1337
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,838
First, they didn't have
the bamboo umbrellas
for the wine

1338
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:51,473
and now snails
on the food.

1339
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:54,351
(Navin)
Two boobs!
That's what he takes us for!

1340
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:57,117
[Honking]

1341
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:07,123
Hi, honey.

1342
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:08,423
Hi, doll face.

1343
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:09,858
Everything okay?

1344
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:13,669
Remember how you told me
to take unnecessary lessons?

1345
01:17:14,062 --> 01:17:16,198
Well, I just took
a lesson.

1346
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:17,799
And a very
good student, too.

1347
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,701
Adios, senora.
Adios.

1348
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:21,339
You took bullfighting?

1349
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,413
No. Knife-throwing.

1350
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:26,486
(Navin)
Knife-throwing is great!

1351
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:28,087
I can almost do it.

1352
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:30,012
Well, let me
see your stuff.

1353
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:31,547
Okay.

1354
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:34,716
This is very good
for a beginner.

1355
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:39,729
This is exciting.
I love this!

1356
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:41,592
Come on.

1357
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:45,594
(Marie)
Turn sideways.
Okay.

1358
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:48,074
And put a balloon
in your mouth.

1359
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,169
Do you have a balloon?

1360
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:51,777
Uh, no.

1361
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:53,711
Oh, wait. Yes.

1362
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:56,109
(Marie)
Okay.

1363
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,674
Is it in your mouth?

1364
01:17:58,674 --> 01:17:59,775
Uh-huh!

1365
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:02,346
Throw 'em good
and hard so they'll stick.

1366
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:04,319
Okay.

1367
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:08,651
One,

1368
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:10,654
two,

1369
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,189
three!

1370
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:15,325
Four, five, six!

1371
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:19,661
Oh!

1372
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:21,669
I missed.

1373
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:23,665
Honey, you did good.

1374
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:26,674
I can't do anything right.

1375
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:30,276
Honey, you worry too much.

1376
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:35,179
Come on. Let's flop this over
and look at it another way.

1377
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:38,513
Why, do you realize
in the past two short months,

1378
01:18:38,513 --> 01:18:41,049
we have acquired
the sophistication

1379
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:43,927
it takes some people
a lifetime to acquire?

1380
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:45,528
Come on!

1381
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:47,361
Let's toast!

1382
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:51,435
[People chattering]

1383
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:00,713
[Crowd cheering]

1384
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:49,056
(woman)
Everybody, Navin's on TV.
Marie, it's Navin!

1385
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:52,454
Oh, honey, here's that
interview you did on TV.

1386
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:55,423
Shut off the music!
Shut it off!
Shut off the music!

1387
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:58,293
Everyone,
we're going to watch Navin
on the TV.

1388
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:01,239
Now, sit down.
Just sit on the floor.
Sit around.

1389
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,799
(Clete Roberts)
American Time Newsmagazine,

1390
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,903
turns its probing eye
on Navin Johnson,

1391
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:07,808
inventor of the Opti-Grab.

1392
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:10,238
That little glasses handle
that sold

1393
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:12,877
10 million units in
a few short months.

1394
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:16,785
(Clete Roberts)
Mr. Johnson, you've become
a millionaire overnight.

1395
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:18,319
Who are you?

1396
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:21,254
Who is Navin Johnson?

1397
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:24,886
Navin is
a complex personality,

1398
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:27,389
as are most of
the small breed

1399
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:29,835
of modern-day
Renaissance millionaires.

1400
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:33,795
(Clete Roberts)
We had planned to show you
the entire Johnson interview.

1401
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:35,764
However, when we
returned to our studio,

1402
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:37,666
our news department
informed us

1403
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,840
of a sensational development
in the Johnson story.

1404
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:43,772
It seems that
an irate group of citizens

1405
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:46,808
led by the celebrity
Mr. Carl Reiner,

1406
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:49,945
has filed a class-action suit
against Mr. Johnson

1407
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:51,413
and his Opti-Grab.

1408
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:54,482
Here's what Mr. Reiner had
to say at a press conference.

1409
01:20:54,482 --> 01:20:57,719
When Opti-Grab came out,
I thought it was
the greatest thing ever.

1410
01:20:57,719 --> 01:20:58,959
And I bought a pair.

1411
01:20:59,421 --> 01:21:01,093
And this is the result.

1412
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:02,460
[All gasping]

1413
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:04,960
(Carl)
This little handle is
like a magnet.

1414
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:09,067
Your eyes are
constantly drawn to it
and you end up cockeyed.

1415
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:12,904
Now, as a director,
I am constantly using my eyes.

1416
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:15,103
And this Opti-Grab
device has caused

1417
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:17,014
irreparable harm to my career.

1418
01:21:17,505 --> 01:21:19,814
Let me show you
a clip from my latest film,

1419
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:22,216
where my faulty
depth perception kept me

1420
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:24,619
from yelling "cut"
at the proper time.

1421
01:21:27,749 --> 01:21:28,920
(Carl)
Cut!

1422
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:40,162
(Carl)
If I had yelled "cut" on time,

1423
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:42,741
those actors
would be alive today.

1424
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:47,442
That's why I'm spearheading
the $10-million
class-action suit

1425
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:51,377
against Mr. Johnson
and his irresponsible
selling of a product,

1426
01:21:51,606 --> 01:21:54,177
he didn't even test
on prisoners.

1427
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:56,011
Thank you.

1428
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:58,380
(woman)
The party's over.
Nouveau riche.

1429
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,282
You know what I mean?

1430
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:02,918
What is this?
Hey, wait a second.
Where are you going?

1431
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,552
(man)
This guy's something else.

1432
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:06,759
I'm gonna get in touch
with that Reiner guy.

1433
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:10,091
I got some... I got some
change upstairs.

1434
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:13,197
We'll get some, uh,
potato chips and
there's some beer up there.

1435
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:15,670
We'll make it
a less formal thing.

1436
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:17,198
[Crowd chattering]

1437
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:19,041
(man)
Let's find another party.

1438
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:25,115
Honey!
Why the gloom?

1439
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:27,509
It's not the end
of the rainbow.

1440
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,579
I'm Navin Johnson,
inventor!

1441
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:34,525
This is no big deal.
It's a parking ticket to me.

1442
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:37,827
Only instead of $5,
it's $10,000,000.

1443
01:22:39,154 --> 01:22:41,861
I don't care about
losing all the money.

1444
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:45,234
It's losing all the stuff.

1445
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:48,565
We're not gonna
lose the stuff.

1446
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:50,031
[Chuckling]

1447
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:51,733
This is America!

1448
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:55,703
We're gonna receive
a fair trial from
an impartial jury.

1449
01:22:56,237 --> 01:22:57,339
[Mallet pounding]

1450
01:22:57,339 --> 01:23:00,513
Your Honor, we, the jury,
find for the plaintiff.

1451
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:02,217
[People applauding]

1452
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:08,718
I award, to Mr. Reiner

1453
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:11,586
and the other nine million

1454
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:14,255
nine hundred and 87 thousand

1455
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:16,826
six hundred
and 52 plaintiffs,

1456
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:19,402
the full amount of the suit.

1457
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:23,375
Court is adjourned!

1458
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:25,734
[People applauding]

1459
01:23:29,704 --> 01:23:30,910
Navin.

1460
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:32,882
Honey, can't you see
I'm drinking?

1461
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:41,918
Pay to the order of

1462
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:45,188
Mrs. Wilbur Stark

1463
01:23:46,788 --> 01:23:49,200
$1.09!

1464
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,546
Pay to the order of

1465
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:11,654
Iron Balls McGinty

1466
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:15,625
$1.09!

1467
01:24:17,685 --> 01:24:18,953
Why are you crying?

1468
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:21,156
And why are you
wearing that old dress?

1469
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:23,324
Because I just heard
a song on the radio

1470
01:24:23,324 --> 01:24:25,394
that reminded me
of the way we were.

1471
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,128
What was it?

1472
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:28,504
The Way We Were.

1473
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:31,474
[Sniffling]
Look at us.
We've hit bottom.

1474
01:24:31,766 --> 01:24:35,770
No! Maybe you've hit bottom,
but I haven't hit bottom yet!

1475
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:38,282
I've got a ways to go!

1476
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,744
And I'm gonna bounce back!

1477
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:42,285
And when I do,

1478
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:45,922
I'm gonna buy you
a diamond so big

1479
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:48,251
it's gonna make you puke.

1480
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:51,252
I don't wanna puke!

1481
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:53,026
I don't want wealth!

1482
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:56,659
I just want you
like you used to be.

1483
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:58,993
What happened to that man?

1484
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:00,437
Me?

1485
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:03,271
What happened to
the girl I believed in?

1486
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:06,008
The girl I fell in love with.

1487
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:08,170
The girl that believed in me.

1488
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:12,273
There's plenty of places
I can go,

1489
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:14,242
where people
believe in me.

1490
01:25:14,242 --> 01:25:15,577
Well, go!

1491
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:17,645
The sooner
you're out of my life,

1492
01:25:17,645 --> 01:25:19,848
the sooner I can go back
to being the girl

1493
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:21,749
in this little flowered dress

1494
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:25,788
that you sang
the thermos song to.

1495
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:27,996
Well, I'm gonna go, then!

1496
01:25:29,023 --> 01:25:32,026
And I don't need any of this!
I don't need this stuff!

1497
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:35,297
And I don't need you!
I don't need anything!

1498
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:38,202
Except this.

1499
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,010
This ashtray.
The only thing I need is this!

1500
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:47,182
I don't need this or this.
Just this ashtray!

1501
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:50,287
And this paddle game.

1502
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:54,453
The ashtray
and the paddle game.
And that's all I need!

1503
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:58,419
And this remote control.

1504
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:00,955
The ashtray, the paddle game,
and the remote control.

1505
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:02,593
And that's all I need!

1506
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:06,438
And these matches.

1507
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:10,098
The ashtray and these matches

1508
01:26:10,098 --> 01:26:12,771
and the remote control
and the paddle ball.

1509
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:15,939
This lamp.

1510
01:26:18,306 --> 01:26:19,546
The ashtray,

1511
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:24,453
this paddle game
and the remote control,

1512
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:27,986
and the lamp.
And that's all I need.

1513
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,024
[Crying]

1514
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:33,089
And that's all I need, too.

1515
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:36,358
I don't need one other thing!

1516
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:38,570
Not one...
I need this.

1517
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:42,731
The paddle game and the chair,

1518
01:26:43,298 --> 01:26:47,405
and the remote control
and the matches, for sure!

1519
01:26:49,237 --> 01:26:51,512
(Navin)
Wh-what are you looking at?

1520
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:55,243
What do you think I am?
Some kind of
a jerk or something?

1521
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:57,551
[Sobbing]

1522
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:03,519
And this.

1523
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:07,088
That's all I need.

1524
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:09,565
The ashtray,

1525
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:12,763
the remote control
and this paddle game,

1526
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:16,231
and this magazine
and the chair.

1527
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:17,973
[Sobbing]

1528
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:24,706
And I don't need
one other thing.

1529
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:26,608
Except my dog.

1530
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:27,916
[Growling]

1531
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,980
I don't need my dog.

1532
01:28:39,547 --> 01:28:41,890
(Navin)
So, that's it.

1533
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:44,327
It's an old story.

1534
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:47,022
One you've probably
heard before.

1535
01:28:47,522 --> 01:28:49,194
[Cars honking]

1536
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:51,904
But I never thought
it would happen to me.

1537
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:55,472
[Sighing]

1538
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:05,044
[Car honking]

1539
01:29:05,807 --> 01:29:08,753
(Taj)
Hey! Any of you bums ever
heard of Navin R. Johnson?

1540
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:12,923
I've heard of him.

1541
01:29:13,047 --> 01:29:14,491
Born in Mississippi?

1542
01:29:15,383 --> 01:29:16,851
Uh-huh!

1543
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:18,762
Inventor of the Opti-Grab?

1544
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:21,356
I was just
telling these guys.

1545
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:24,459
Son!

1546
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:27,265
Daddy!

1547
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,198
Navin.

1548
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:31,299
Mom!

1549
01:29:31,299 --> 01:29:32,402
My baby!

1550
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:35,303
Navin.
Elvira!

1551
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:36,975
I knew we'd find you.

1552
01:29:38,272 --> 01:29:39,682
Taj!
Don't kiss me.

1553
01:29:40,274 --> 01:29:41,809
[All laughing]

1554
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:48,049
I called them
the night you left.

1555
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:50,084
How did you find me?

1556
01:29:50,084 --> 01:29:51,319
I don't know.

1557
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:52,987
This is the first
place we looked.

1558
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:55,289
We're takin' you home
and you're gonna live with us.

1559
01:29:55,289 --> 01:29:57,928
Turns out,
Dad's a financial genius.

1560
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:01,095
All I did was
take the money you sent home

1561
01:30:01,095 --> 01:30:03,632
and embarked on
a periodic investment,

1562
01:30:03,765 --> 01:30:05,733
in a no-load mutual fund.

1563
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:09,442
He leveraged his ass deep
into soy beans
and cocoa futures.

1564
01:30:09,704 --> 01:30:10,773
Right on!

1565
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,413
I picked out
this thermos for you.

1566
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,020
I'd kiss you,
but I'm so dirty.

1567
01:30:21,149 --> 01:30:22,923
Dirt doesn't bother me.

1568
01:30:24,352 --> 01:30:25,787
But the smell does.

1569
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:27,129
Oh, Navin.

1570
01:30:27,288 --> 01:30:28,596
[Exclaims]

1571
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:33,394
Son, you'd better
get in the back
with the dog

1572
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:36,136
until we can get you
hosed down.

1573
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:44,839
[Shithead barking]

1574
01:30:44,839 --> 01:30:46,249
I love you, Navin.

1575
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:47,784
I love you, too.

1576
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:51,581
(Taj)
Somebody open a window!

1577
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:53,992
(Father)
Open all the windows.

1578
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:58,587
(Navin)
I was so glad
to be going home.

1579
01:30:58,853 --> 01:31:01,322
I remembered the days
when I sang and danced

1580
01:31:01,322 --> 01:31:03,734
with my family on the porch
of the old house.

1581
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:07,973
But things change,
and with all the additions
to the family,

1582
01:31:08,162 --> 01:31:11,199
we had to tear down
the old house,
even though we loved it.

1583
01:31:11,532 --> 01:31:13,267
But we built us a bigger one.

1584
01:31:13,267 --> 01:31:14,702
(family)
Pick a bale a day

1585
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:16,838
Whoa Lordie
Pick a bale of cotton

1586
01:31:16,838 --> 01:31:19,307
Whoa Lordie
Pick a bale a day

1587
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,509
Gonna jump down, turn around
Pick a bale of cotton

1588
