1
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,583
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

2
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,374
What do you want to know?

3
00:01:34,254 --> 00:01:36,584
Just a sec, it hasn't recorded.

4
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:41,045
There.

5
00:01:42,315 --> 00:01:45,775
So, the way you describe
the son's accident...

6
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:49,256
It's troubling to read
because we know it's your life.

7
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:51,836
Do you think one can only
write from experience?

8
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:01,877
Come. Jump!

9
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:04,127
Jump!

10
00:02:04,587 --> 00:02:06,298
Jump. C'mon!

11
00:02:08,158 --> 00:02:09,828
Jump! Jump!

12
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,509
It leads me
to an interesting story,

13
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:16,469
and I decide to put you
in the book I'm writing.

14
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:18,629
It's not more. You're in my book.

15
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,859
And yet, I don't know you.

16
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,050
What I do know about
is my interest in you.

17
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,680
But still, you had to meet me first.

18
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,720
I'm real, in front of you now.

19
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:31,801
Yes, that you are.

20
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:34,341
Yeah, so, for you to start inventing,

21
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:36,341
you need something real first.

22
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:38,722
You say your books
always mix truth and fiction.

23
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:41,592
That makes us want
to figure out which is which.

24
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,552
Is that your goal?

25
00:02:48,513 --> 00:02:49,843
OK, get out.

26
00:02:54,253 --> 00:02:55,414
Snoop, come!

27
00:02:56,934 --> 00:02:59,304
Let's dry you off.
You're nice and clean.

28
00:02:59,474 --> 00:03:00,724
No more dirt.

29
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:09,095
What would you write about?

30
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:12,476
It's Samuel working upstairs.
My husband.

31
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:17,686
So, what interests you?

32
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:20,186
What makes you so mad
you want to explode?

33
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:22,687
Forget about your thesis,
your studies.

34
00:03:22,887 --> 00:03:24,637
I don't want to be a writer.

35
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:28,227
That's OK, you don't have to write,
just talk, like we're talking now.

36
00:03:28,387 --> 00:03:30,388
You don't want to go on
with my questions?

37
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:34,228
Of course I do.
But we could chat too.

38
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:36,768
Maybe we ask one question each,

39
00:03:36,938 --> 00:03:40,689
so nobody's frustrated,
like a normal conversation.

40
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,769
Are you really interested in...

41
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:46,520
What interests you?
Come on, sure.

42
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,610
I never see anybody,
I work here all day long,

43
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,770
you come to see me,
of course you interest me.

44
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,131
I run.

45
00:03:57,591 --> 00:03:59,961
It's one of my favorite things to do.

46
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:02,382
Makes me feel high,
like I'm on drugs.

47
00:04:03,752 --> 00:04:06,422
What do you know about drugs?

48
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:08,022
That's the next question.

49
00:04:08,462 --> 00:04:09,752
Big subject.

50
00:04:10,673 --> 00:04:12,883
Maybe don't write everything down.

51
00:04:13,043 --> 00:04:14,383
Surely not.

52
00:04:23,174 --> 00:04:26,794
I told you,
we should have done this in Grenoble.

53
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:30,095
It's fine.
I'll write your answers down.

54
00:04:30,295 --> 00:04:34,095
But I have many questions.
Maybe you don't have the time.

55
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:38,096
Don't worry about time,
time is not the problem here.

56
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:39,596
OK. Cool.

57
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:41,716
I'd like to discuss storytelling...

58
00:04:41,926 --> 00:04:43,466
I don't like sports.

59
00:04:43,636 --> 00:04:44,887
That's the first thing.

60
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:48,047
Walking yes, maybe.
Running, no!

61
00:04:48,717 --> 00:04:50,387
OK, right, I get it.

62
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:52,387
So,

63
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:54,508
you're...

64
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:05,679
It's not really possible anymore,
is it?

65
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:07,259
Yes, it's complicated.

66
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:09,510
I think we have to stop, ZoÃ©.

67
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,350
I'll be in Grenoble soon,
I'll give you a call.

68
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:24,681
Sorry about that.

69
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:30,682
- See you soon.
- Yes, for sure.

70
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:25,866
Careful.

71
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,820
Dad...

72
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,911
Mom!

73
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:07,911
Mom!

74
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:13,912
Mom, come quick!

75
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:00,667
Yes...

76
00:09:01,077 --> 00:09:02,457
No, I don't know.

77
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:05,328
I didn't move him,
I didn't touch him at all.

78
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,458
He's not breathing,
that's why I'm calling.

79
00:09:10,378 --> 00:09:13,419
No, please come,
I can't answer all the questions.

80
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:19,419
No, he's not moving.
Please just come.

81
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,251
Samuel Maleski,

82
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:32,671
found dead below his chalet...

83
00:10:05,135 --> 00:10:06,715
Turning him now.

84
00:10:10,295 --> 00:10:11,546
Full shot.

85
00:10:12,676 --> 00:10:13,966
Close up.

86
00:10:16,636 --> 00:10:18,546
I'll dictate the initial ideas.

87
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:21,387
Insert them before the conclusion.

88
00:10:21,717 --> 00:10:25,547
The parallel, superficial abrasions
on the hands and forearms

89
00:10:25,717 --> 00:10:28,588
suggest the body slid
1 or 2 meters upon impact

90
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:31,838
before reaching
its final, supine position.

91
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:36,299
A left temporal hematoma
related to the fatal brain trauma

92
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,219
indicates collision with
a blunt object in the environment

93
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,819
or a violent blow to the head.

94
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,300
Injury location is inconsistent
with discovery position,

95
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,140
thus impact occurred
before the body hit the ground.

96
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,051
In conclusion,
we cannot yet determine

97
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,591
if the injury resulted
from a collision or a blow.

98
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:03,302
We cannot, at this stage,
rule out third party involvement.

99
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:07,182
Then, the usual.

100
00:11:07,552 --> 00:11:09,592
CAUSE OF DEATH: HEAD TRAUMA.

101
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:11,593
FORENSIC CAUSE:

102
00:11:11,973 --> 00:11:14,263
ACCIDENTAL AND/OR DELIBERATE.

103
00:11:14,493 --> 00:11:18,824
Toxicological analysis needed
to establish the truth.

104
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:28,652
Anatomy of a fall.

105
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:11,907
Thank you for coming.

106
00:13:13,487 --> 00:13:15,528
It's really weird,
seeing you again like this.

107
00:13:15,698 --> 00:13:16,778
- It is.
- OK.

108
00:13:19,408 --> 00:13:22,358
I didn't realize it was so high.

109
00:13:22,858 --> 00:13:24,239
Yeah.

110
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:26,159
Come.

111
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:32,990
Have you lived here long?

112
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,990
Less than two years.

113
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,070
Samuel grew up here.

114
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,490
It's his...

115
00:13:46,531 --> 00:13:47,781
Well...

116
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:56,612
How are we gonna do this?
Will you ask me some questions...

117
00:13:57,032 --> 00:14:00,613
I'm really sorry my French
isn't any better than when we met.

118
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:02,283
- No. English is fine.
- OK.

119
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:08,614
How many times
have you been questioned?

120
00:14:09,284 --> 00:14:12,364
It's been once here,
by the policemen,

121
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:15,075
and once
by the investigative judge.

122
00:14:16,745 --> 00:14:20,575
Can you tell me what you told them
about the day he died?

123
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:21,745
Yes, of course.

124
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:25,136
I told them everything,
from when I was with the student

125
00:14:25,286 --> 00:14:27,286
until the ambulance got here.

126
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,076
I was in the middle of a meeting
with this girl,

127
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:32,747
and Samuel started

128
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:36,217
blasting a song on repeat
to piss me off and make her leave.

129
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:39,207
Did you tell them he played
the song to piss you off?

130
00:14:39,368 --> 00:14:40,458
No.

131
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:45,008
I just said he played the song
super loud and we had to stop.

132
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:48,499
She was recording the interview
and it wasn't possible anymore.

133
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,669
I need you to be precise.

134
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:56,370
Tell me everything
exactly the way you told them.

135
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,620
Yes.

136
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,920
So. I told them that
I put an end to the interview.

137
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,080
And that she left.

138
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,711
And I went upstairs to my bedroom

139
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:09,921
and that's when I saw Daniel
go out for a walk.

140
00:15:10,141 --> 00:15:11,721
He wasn't at school?

141
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,332
No, he only goes
two days a week in Grenoble.

142
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:15,962
How old is he now?

143
00:15:16,122 --> 00:15:17,422
He's eleven.

144
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,332
And then...

145
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:23,253
So, after the girl left...

146
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,423
Samuel came down
to see me in my bedroom.

147
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,754
We spoke a bit about
what we were going to do that day.

148
00:15:30,924 --> 00:15:32,584
It was nothing special, really.

149
00:15:35,464 --> 00:15:36,624
He...

150
00:15:36,794 --> 00:15:40,425
He went back upstairs to work
in the attic and I worked in bed.

151
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:43,545
You wrote? On your computer?

152
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:45,755
Yes, I finished a translation.

153
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:49,126
I translate for some German weeklies,
for extra money.

154
00:15:50,336 --> 00:15:51,466
And then...

155
00:15:52,426 --> 00:15:55,967
Yes. I heard him working upstairs
and playing his music

156
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:58,757
for about, I think it must've been

157
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:00,087
ten minutes.

158
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:03,798
Then I put some earplugs in
because I wanted to take a nap.

159
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:06,338
And..

160
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:08,338
I fell asleep.

161
00:16:10,758 --> 00:16:12,759
And an hour later, I think,

162
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:15,469
I heard Daniel scream, and then...

163
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:22,800
An earplug must've fallen out,
because it woke me up.

164
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,680
The music was still on,
I ran downstairs, and...

165
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,381
Yes. That's it.

166
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:32,381
I called the SAMU
and they arrived 30 minutes later.

167
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:45,383
- Can I take a look around?
- Of course.

168
00:16:45,553 --> 00:16:46,763
- Yes?
- Yes.

169
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:55,384
Where do you want to start?
Should I explain... something.

170
00:16:55,554 --> 00:16:56,724
Yeah, maybe.

171
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,684
Yeah. This is where...

172
00:16:58,844 --> 00:17:00,434
This is where we eat.

173
00:17:00,594 --> 00:17:02,305
- Yes, sorry...
- No...

174
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:27,598
So...

175
00:17:28,518 --> 00:17:29,728
He was working over there?

176
00:17:29,888 --> 00:17:31,848
Yeah, he was insulating the attic.

177
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:36,479
And when you were having a nap,
he was right above you?

178
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,389
- Yes.
- OK.

179
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,560
So...

180
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,730
He was supposed to get to that next.

181
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,141
We wanted to make rooms for B&B.

182
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,526
So, he was working there?

183
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:37,986
These days, yes.

184
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:42,486
And the window,

185
00:18:43,027 --> 00:18:45,527
when the ambulance arrived,
was it open?

186
00:18:45,737 --> 00:18:47,107
Yes, it was.

187
00:18:48,897 --> 00:18:50,898
He used to keep it open?

188
00:18:51,858 --> 00:18:54,028
I'm not sure of that really, because

189
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:55,858
sometimes he would air the room

190
00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:58,068
to get rid of the wood dust.

191
00:18:58,278 --> 00:19:01,649
Was he reckless?
Did he ever take risks while working?

192
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:05,899
No, he was cautious and meticulous,
he worked slowly.

193
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,901
Is there any reason why he would've

194
00:19:17,131 --> 00:19:20,081
leaned out the window,
for instance, to call out to you

195
00:19:20,301 --> 00:19:21,091
or Daniel?

196
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:26,152
No, when he was working, especially when
he was playing his music, he kinda...

197
00:19:27,742 --> 00:19:29,992
he shut himself off from the world.

198
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:32,702
So, he never called
for me or Daniel up here.

199
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,743
Anyway, with the height of the...

200
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:39,423
Windowsill?

201
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,214
- Windowsill.
- Yeah.

202
00:19:44,154 --> 00:19:45,534
Had he been drinking?

203
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:46,994
No, never during the day.

204
00:19:47,224 --> 00:19:49,224
Especially when he was working.

205
00:19:58,246 --> 00:19:59,456
Sweetie...

206
00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:03,826
Come wash up and get dressed.
It's daytime, you need to get up.

207
00:20:06,326 --> 00:20:08,997
Honey, I know this is hard.
It's hard for me too.

208
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:11,617
And it's going to be hard
for a while.

209
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:16,958
But we have to try and do
the things that we did before...

210
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:24,409
Monica came to see you,
she made you Tiramisu.

211
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:29,579
You can't spend all day
without going outside.

212
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:32,620
It's beautiful out.
And Snoop needs to go out too.

213
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:43,331
Daniel,
will you come eat with us?

214
00:20:43,871 --> 00:20:45,041
I want to sleep.

215
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:48,792
OK, first eat with us,
then you can sleep.

216
00:21:23,756 --> 00:21:25,256
I don't understand.

217
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:28,666
No one understands.

218
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:30,417
We can't understand.

219
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,877
I have to understand.

220
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:46,468
Remember the psychic
I told you about,

221
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:48,799
the one I saw when Alain died?

222
00:21:49,969 --> 00:21:51,379
Monica.

223
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:52,549
I'd like to.

224
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:54,469
I'd rather you don't...

225
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:56,630
He helped me a lot.

226
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,130
But he's a child.

227
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,670
Don't confuse things.

228
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,300
I'll discuss it with Monica.

229
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,510
She's helped children before.

230
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:07,721
Want some?

231
00:22:17,722 --> 00:22:19,342
What do you need?

232
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,343
Nothing, I'm OK.

233
00:22:21,513 --> 00:22:22,723
OK.

234
00:22:32,094 --> 00:22:34,924
Your doubts aside, it might help him.

235
00:22:35,094 --> 00:22:37,975
She senses things we can't.

236
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,305
Vincent, an old lawyer friend,

237
00:22:41,475 --> 00:22:43,635
Monica, Daniel's Godmother.

238
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:45,265
- Hello.
- Hello.

239
00:22:45,425 --> 00:22:47,806
- I'll call you.
- Tell me if he eats.

240
00:22:48,016 --> 00:22:49,016
Yes.

241
00:22:53,176 --> 00:22:54,517
Plates?

242
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:08,018
I'm so tired of crying.

243
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,388
It's really ridiculous,
I'm so exhausted.

244
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:13,729
- Want Parmesan?
- Yes, it's perfect.

245
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:17,019
- I don't know where the pepper is.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

246
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,890
So, as you know,
the autopsy report is inconclusive

247
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,600
about the cause of death.

248
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,771
The forensic pathologist
didn't have enough concrete elements.

249
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:30,101
But...

250
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:33,431
What we can defend,

251
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:37,412
is a fall from the attic window,
with him...

252
00:23:38,392 --> 00:23:40,642
bouncing off the shed roof.

253
00:23:40,872 --> 00:23:43,782
His head may have hit the edge
somewhere around here.

254
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:47,483
You see?

255
00:23:48,483 --> 00:23:50,733
Then he would have landed
on the ground,

256
00:23:50,893 --> 00:23:52,313
approximately here.

257
00:23:52,734 --> 00:23:56,564
It seems that he found the strength
to crawl one meter or two

258
00:23:56,734 --> 00:24:00,184
before collapsing
in this final position.

259
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:03,105
That explains
the blood on the snow.

260
00:24:03,855 --> 00:24:05,235
But there are several problems.

261
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:08,485
First, they found nothing
on the roof, no DNA.

262
00:24:09,045 --> 00:24:12,876
And there's these 3 blood spatters
here on the wall.

263
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:17,606
It seems it doesn't really match
with the head impact on the roof.

264
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:21,287
The judge has asked an expert
to clarify this.

265
00:24:22,187 --> 00:24:24,937
When you see this
what do you think?

266
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,818
I don't know,
I'm not a spatter analyst.

267
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:34,739
But I know a very good one.

268
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,899
I'm going to get her opinion.

269
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,401
There's one last problem for us,

270
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:54,031
that bruise on your arm.

271
00:24:55,651 --> 00:24:59,281
It might look like
the result of a fight or struggle.

272
00:25:01,442 --> 00:25:02,652
When did they see it?

273
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:06,212
They examined me that night,
my sleeve was rolled up.

274
00:25:06,362 --> 00:25:08,403
You explained it to them right away?

275
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,323
I knew how it happened.
Shall I show you?

276
00:25:10,493 --> 00:25:11,783
Yes, please.

277
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:15,903
Here in the kitchen,
I bang my arm on this all the time.

278
00:25:16,243 --> 00:25:17,744
Like, when I move.

279
00:25:18,244 --> 00:25:21,784
It's ridiculous, it happened
several times that week.

280
00:25:21,944 --> 00:25:24,154
I told them my skin marks easily

281
00:25:24,324 --> 00:25:26,865
and they can ask Daniel.
He hears me bumping into it.

282
00:25:27,615 --> 00:25:28,905
OK. Good.

283
00:25:33,155 --> 00:25:36,786
So. As you can see, an accidental
fall will be hard to defend,

284
00:25:36,946 --> 00:25:40,116
given the height of the windowsill.

285
00:25:40,446 --> 00:25:43,497
So that's why
there's an investigation for...

286
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:45,367
more suspects.

287
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,367
And you're...

288
00:25:47,537 --> 00:25:49,497
more "Suspicious death".

289
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:52,548
You're an assisted witness because
you were the only person there.

290
00:25:52,698 --> 00:25:53,828
OK.

291
00:25:54,158 --> 00:25:55,948
And of course, you're his wife.

292
00:25:57,788 --> 00:25:59,829
Now, looking for
a stranger who walks in,

293
00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:04,039
kills him while you were sleeping
and Daniel was out for a walk

294
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:05,869
is a shitty strategy.

295
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,700
Samuel had no enemies.

296
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,120
Stop!

297
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,910
I did not kill him.

298
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,661
That's not the point.

299
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:18,451
Really.

300
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:24,502
We have to go through
Samuel's personality.

301
00:26:25,162 --> 00:26:26,582
What was he was going through?

302
00:26:28,582 --> 00:26:32,083
Is there anything
that would seem consistent with

303
00:26:32,253 --> 00:26:33,373
suicide?

304
00:26:39,543 --> 00:26:41,084
I thought about it, obviously.

305
00:26:41,254 --> 00:26:44,164
I just can't imagine him jumping
with Daniel so close by.

306
00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:47,334
I just can't get it in my head.

307
00:26:50,665 --> 00:26:53,295
Yeah, but it's probably
our best defense.

308
00:26:53,455 --> 00:26:55,625
I mean, if they indict you,

309
00:26:56,255 --> 00:26:57,666
it's our only defense.

310
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,416
But I think he fell.

311
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,046
Nobody's going to believe that.

312
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,207
I don't believe that.

313
00:27:09,917 --> 00:27:11,297
I need a smoke.

314
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:41,761
Vincent.

315
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:45,261
There's something
I want to tell you.

316
00:27:46,841 --> 00:27:48,512
About six months ago,

317
00:27:49,302 --> 00:27:51,172
I wonder if...

318
00:27:51,552 --> 00:27:54,132
Samuel didn't swallow some pills.

319
00:27:54,512 --> 00:27:57,553
I found him passed out drunk
on the floor.

320
00:27:57,783 --> 00:27:59,983
He'd vomited.
It was very early in the morning.

321
00:28:00,883 --> 00:28:02,883
There were some white spots

322
00:28:03,113 --> 00:28:04,113
in the vomit,

323
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:07,634
and I remember wondering
if they were pills.

324
00:28:09,464 --> 00:28:11,094
- <i>Really?</i>
- Yes.

325
00:28:11,264 --> 00:28:13,265
<i>Did you two talk about it?</i>

326
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,515
No, he didn't want to talk about it.

327
00:28:16,175 --> 00:28:17,265
<i>Did Daniel see this?</i>

328
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:18,515
No.

329
00:28:19,015 --> 00:28:21,636
<i>ï»¿And you didn't call a doctor?</i>

330
00:28:21,806 --> 00:28:25,266
No, I didn't realize it back then,
but looking back at it now,

331
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:29,016
it seems like it might have been
a suicide attempt.

332
00:28:34,717 --> 00:28:36,217
<i>ï»¿Does anyone know about this?</i>

333
00:28:36,387 --> 00:28:37,427
No.

334
00:28:40,768 --> 00:28:42,058
OK. I'll call you back.

335
00:28:42,218 --> 00:28:43,388
Yes.

336
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:44,718
- <i>OK.</i>
- Bye.

337
00:29:46,896 --> 00:29:48,316
Is the light too bright?

338
00:29:49,476 --> 00:29:51,436
Want me to lower the blinds?

339
00:29:52,316 --> 00:29:53,647
I'm OK.

340
00:29:53,817 --> 00:29:55,027
Yeah?

341
00:29:55,187 --> 00:29:56,187
OK.

342
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:59,687
You didn't tell me about
your parents' arguments.

343
00:30:02,228 --> 00:30:05,648
What do you mean?
I don't really remember any.

344
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:11,479
When they start yelling,
I prefer to leave.

345
00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:15,109
Can you tell me who was angrier?

346
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:17,529
No.

347
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,230
Is that why you left
the day your dad died?

348
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,941
No, I just felt like a walk.

349
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:31,531
OK. You say you heard
your parents when you left?

350
00:30:31,941 --> 00:30:34,321
Do you remember the conversation?

351
00:30:35,151 --> 00:30:37,442
More or less. It wasn't a fight.

352
00:30:39,782 --> 00:30:42,692
I couldn't hear the words,
but it wasn't...

353
00:30:42,862 --> 00:30:45,533
Then you don't know
it was a fight.

354
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:49,283
I could tell...
I could hear it wasn't a fight.

355
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:52,614
Daniel, the music was loud,
you were outside.

356
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,694
They were in her bedroom,
two floors up.

357
00:30:56,074 --> 00:30:57,944
How can you be sure?

358
00:30:58,334 --> 00:31:01,085
I wonder
if you could hear them at all.

359
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:03,785
I was just below the open window.

360
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,615
I know what I heard.

361
00:31:07,925 --> 00:31:09,006
OK.

362
00:31:14,696 --> 00:31:15,786
Is it over?

363
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:20,487
How can you be so sure
where you were?

364
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:22,907
Because I touched the..

365
00:31:23,077 --> 00:31:24,947
Gaffer tape on the woodshed.

366
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:27,658
Gaffer tape?

367
00:31:28,038 --> 00:31:29,488
When we moved in,

368
00:31:29,718 --> 00:31:32,878
Dad put tape with
different textures everywhere,

369
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:34,699
- so I could feel my way.
- Yes.

370
00:31:35,449 --> 00:31:39,239
I don't really need them now,
but I still touch them.

371
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:41,199
Each piece feels different,

372
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:42,620
I wouldn't get it wrong.

373
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,870
I touched the woodshed tape.

374
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,370
So I was under the window.

375
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,661
OK.

376
00:31:56,871 --> 00:31:58,911
I transposed what you told me.

377
00:31:59,082 --> 00:32:00,962
But I didn't say it in French.

378
00:32:01,122 --> 00:32:03,372
The volume is what matters here,

379
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:06,082
and French is easier for everyone.

380
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:09,123
Helene, start the music.

381
00:32:15,243 --> 00:32:16,374
Did it go well?

382
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:18,454
Yes, nothing special.

383
00:32:18,624 --> 00:32:20,244
What's next this afternoon?

384
00:32:20,414 --> 00:32:24,455
I don't know, I'm tired.
I need to work, then I'll rest.

385
00:32:24,665 --> 00:32:25,795
Not asking me?

386
00:32:25,955 --> 00:32:28,795
I assume
you'll keep working in the attic?

387
00:32:29,705 --> 00:32:30,955
Stop the music.

388
00:32:31,335 --> 00:32:32,415
Stop.

389
00:32:32,956 --> 00:32:33,666
So?

390
00:32:33,836 --> 00:32:35,246
Did you hear anything?

391
00:32:36,526 --> 00:32:39,146
Let's go again, louder this time.

392
00:32:39,836 --> 00:32:43,087
Louder? But I didn't shout at all.

393
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:46,877
The point of the reenactment
is to determine a credible volume.

394
00:32:47,877 --> 00:32:49,548
Vincent, I never shouted.

395
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:54,128
She spoke no louder.
Her son says the voices were calm.

396
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:57,298
That doesn't hold up.
The music drowns them out.

397
00:32:58,049 --> 00:32:59,459
My client didn't shout.

398
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:01,169
She won't shout now.

399
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:03,669
Miss,

400
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,709
please replace Mrs Voyter.

401
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:08,340
Come on in, please.

402
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,380
Play the music.

403
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,880
Start the music!

404
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:16,881
Did it go well?

405
00:33:17,111 --> 00:33:18,441
Yes, nothing special.

406
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:20,551
What's next this afternoon?

407
00:33:20,711 --> 00:33:23,462
I don't know, I'm tired.
I need to work, then I'll rest.

408
00:33:30,822 --> 00:33:32,653
Go again, much louder.

409
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:34,673
Was it good?

410
00:33:34,843 --> 00:33:36,383
Yes, nothing special.

411
00:33:37,273 --> 00:33:38,513
What's next this afternoon?

412
00:33:38,593 --> 00:33:42,134
I don't know, I'm tired.
I need to work, then I'll rest.

413
00:33:42,304 --> 00:33:44,134
Not asking me?

414
00:33:44,304 --> 00:33:46,714
I assume
you'll keep working in the attic?

415
00:33:47,714 --> 00:33:48,805
Stop the music.

416
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:51,675
Now they hear it.

417
00:33:51,845 --> 00:33:52,885
Good.

418
00:33:53,635 --> 00:33:55,675
You do realize that was ridiculous?

419
00:33:55,845 --> 00:33:57,926
Spare me your comments.

420
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,106
It was calm voices, not like that.

421
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:04,636
But see,
you wouldn't have heard them.

422
00:34:06,717 --> 00:34:07,967
Right?

423
00:34:10,427 --> 00:34:13,508
Can we try one last time,
starting inside?

424
00:34:13,848 --> 00:34:15,638
With calm voices again.

425
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:18,558
We can.

426
00:34:43,391 --> 00:34:45,011
I made a mistake.

427
00:34:45,181 --> 00:34:46,181
Cut the music.

428
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:49,352
This is the tape I touched.
I was inside.

429
00:34:51,392 --> 00:34:52,472
I got mixed up.

430
00:34:52,642 --> 00:34:54,312
That's not what you told us.

431
00:34:54,472 --> 00:34:57,973
ZoÃ© Solidor saw you
leave the house after she left.

432
00:34:58,143 --> 00:35:01,473
And your mom says
she spoke to your dad after that.

433
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,393
I got mixed up.

434
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:05,764
You got mixed up.

435
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,014
Well.

436
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:57,237
This afternoon was hard, wasn't it?

437
00:37:03,408 --> 00:37:04,658
I'm mad at myself.

438
00:37:06,028 --> 00:37:08,578
I thought I was sure, and then...

439
00:37:08,908 --> 00:37:10,829
But you didn't lie, did you?

440
00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:18,330
I don't want you
to change your memories.

441
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,990
You have to tell them
exactly like you remember it.

442
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,240
That can never hurt me.

443
00:37:29,201 --> 00:37:30,581
Give me your hand.

444
00:37:33,121 --> 00:37:34,331
Yes.

445
00:37:40,032 --> 00:37:41,532
What do we do now?

446
00:37:44,203 --> 00:37:45,493
You want a drink?

447
00:37:45,873 --> 00:37:47,123
Whiskey?

448
00:37:49,493 --> 00:37:50,583
Come.

449
00:37:52,494 --> 00:37:53,624
Sorry.

450
00:37:57,954 --> 00:37:59,244
All I can say is,

451
00:37:59,454 --> 00:38:04,035
the interrogation is in progress
and may continue for a while.

452
00:38:04,205 --> 00:38:06,785
She's been in there for 8 hours.

453
00:38:06,955 --> 00:38:08,536
Is she in trouble?

454
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:11,086
Sandra Voyter is not in trouble.

455
00:38:11,246 --> 00:38:12,996
She maintains her innocence,

456
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:15,086
so there will be no confession.

457
00:38:15,246 --> 00:38:18,627
You're confident,
but we've heard about a recording.

458
00:38:18,787 --> 00:38:20,287
Is it incriminating?

459
00:38:20,837 --> 00:38:22,667
You're not listening.

460
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:26,958
She has not been indicted,
so nothing is incriminating.

461
00:38:27,128 --> 00:38:29,458
The so-called video is a myth so far.

462
00:38:29,628 --> 00:38:31,498
We've had no access to it.

463
00:38:31,668 --> 00:38:34,089
So, you confirm it's a video?

464
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:38,669
No, I confirm nothing.
I said precisely the opposite.

465
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:41,289
If there's nothing new,
why the summons?

466
00:38:41,459 --> 00:38:43,670
I don't know what to tell you.

467
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,420
We don't understand it ourselves.
Thank you.

468
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,790
Thank you for coming

469
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:53,461
for the public prosecutor's
statement.

470
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:58,752
So, Sandra Voyter was indicted
this morning at 8:30 a.m.

471
00:38:58,982 --> 00:39:03,272
The investigation revealed elements
that justify this decision.

472
00:39:03,422 --> 00:39:04,962
Three elements in particular.

473
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:09,003
Analysis of Mr. Maleski's blood spatter

474
00:39:09,173 --> 00:39:11,753
found at the couple's domicile

475
00:39:11,923 --> 00:39:16,594
indicate he may have received
a blunt force blow to the head

476
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,794
when he was
on the third-floor balcony.

477
00:39:20,294 --> 00:39:22,044
In addition,

478
00:39:22,274 --> 00:39:24,315
the reenactment
done three days ago

479
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:27,755
brought to light
a number of discrepancies.

480
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:29,095
Lastly,

481
00:39:29,255 --> 00:39:34,506
a file was discovered on a USB key
belonging to Mr. Maleski.

482
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:37,216
All I can say about it, for now,

483
00:39:37,386 --> 00:39:40,637
is that it's an audio recording
of the couple,

484
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:43,007
made the day before his death.

485
00:39:45,887 --> 00:39:49,678
As I'm trying to tell you,
she can't come sign herself

486
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:53,258
because she's held up
at the courthouse.

487
00:39:53,718 --> 00:39:56,508
So it'll be me,
her lawyer Vincent Renzi,

488
00:39:56,678 --> 00:39:59,549
coming to get the documents for her.

489
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:02,429
No, I can't come at 11.

490
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:05,350
I can be there in 20 minutes?

491
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,760
OK. Thanks, be right there.

492
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,260
We have good news.

493
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,551
The judge this afternoon
is not Da Silva, it's BollÃ¨ne.

494
00:40:14,671 --> 00:40:15,671
OK.

495
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:17,261
I'm off to the bank.

496
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:19,221
And the home equity loan?

497
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:25,182
Less than we hoped.
They have money problems.

498
00:40:25,352 --> 00:40:26,932
Outstanding credit, etc.

499
00:40:27,102 --> 00:40:30,012
The bank will only do 50,000.

500
00:40:30,182 --> 00:40:33,393
Bail will be more than that.

501
00:40:34,283 --> 00:40:36,533
Her son is a witness.

502
00:40:36,683 --> 00:40:38,683
He'll be testifying in court.

503
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:43,014
There is obviously a risk
of her exerting pressure on him.

504
00:40:43,184 --> 00:40:44,604
As a consequence,

505
00:40:44,764 --> 00:40:47,855
release on bail is not an option.

506
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:52,515
I'm asking you to place Mrs Voyter
in detention pending trial.

507
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:55,515
Thank you.
Over to you, Mrs Boudaoud.

508
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:58,996
Judge, how can we
consider her a flight risk,

509
00:40:59,146 --> 00:41:01,306
when she's responsible for her son?

510
00:41:01,536 --> 00:41:03,036
That makes no sense.

511
00:41:03,186 --> 00:41:05,227
With a visually impaired child?

512
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:07,897
And she's all over the media.

513
00:41:08,057 --> 00:41:11,107
Separating them
could compound his trauma.

514
00:41:11,267 --> 00:41:14,478
He had an accident
at the age of four

515
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:15,748
that damaged his sight.

516
00:41:15,898 --> 00:41:17,478
He's been traumatized,

517
00:41:17,648 --> 00:41:20,228
both psychologically and emotionally.

518
00:41:23,209 --> 00:41:24,959
Mrs Boudaoud, your reaction?

519
00:41:25,669 --> 00:41:29,370
The judge's decision is rare
enough to merit praise.

520
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,020
A judge refusing to give in
to repressive reflexes

521
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,650
is a healthy sign,
especially in such a case.

522
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,271
We feel the release
under judicial supervision

523
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:41,651
underscores the weakness of the case.

524
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:43,401
Is your client relieved?

525
00:41:46,362 --> 00:41:49,482
This is a rare decision
in a homicide accusation,

526
00:41:49,652 --> 00:41:52,112
and reads like
a repudiation of Judge Janvier.

527
00:41:52,272 --> 00:41:55,233
Reactions in the hallways
have been intense.

528
00:41:55,463 --> 00:41:58,713
I quote,
"This decision is dangerous."

529
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:01,693
"The suspect will be reunited
with a major witness."

530
00:42:01,863 --> 00:42:05,064
"It's a real concern
for the upcoming trial."

531
00:42:17,405 --> 00:42:19,235
How could you not tell me about it?

532
00:42:19,405 --> 00:42:21,026
I had no idea he recorded it.

533
00:42:21,126 --> 00:42:22,316
Even if he hadn't...

534
00:42:22,466 --> 00:42:25,046
You had a fight
the day before he died.

535
00:42:42,738 --> 00:42:44,198
That recording

536
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:46,489
is not reality.

537
00:42:47,819 --> 00:42:49,239
It's a part of it, maybe,

538
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:53,490
if you have an extreme moment,
an emotional peak you focus on,

539
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,740
of course it crushes everything.

540
00:42:56,070 --> 00:43:00,120
It may seem like irrefutable proof,
but actually warps everything.

541
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,571
It's not reality. It's our voices,
but it's not who we are.

542
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:06,301
I don't give a fuck
about what is reality. OK.

543
00:43:06,911 --> 00:43:08,741
You need to start seeing yourself

544
00:43:08,911 --> 00:43:10,872
the way others
are going to perceive you.

545
00:43:11,032 --> 00:43:12,952
The trial is not about the truth.

546
00:43:13,122 --> 00:43:15,912
- I didn't know there'd be a trial.
- Well, there is.

547
00:43:26,914 --> 00:43:29,994
Now, what really counts is...

548
00:43:30,954 --> 00:43:33,034
who you have around you.

549
00:43:33,204 --> 00:43:34,574
There's nobody around me.

550
00:43:34,804 --> 00:43:36,055
Yes, there's Daniel.

551
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:38,415
Daniel is important.

552
00:43:39,915 --> 00:43:42,535
And didn't you and Samuel have...

553
00:43:42,705 --> 00:43:44,246
any friends?

554
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:48,496
We should never have come here.
I was so happy in London.

555
00:43:51,416 --> 00:43:52,957
It was him, he insisted.

556
00:43:53,127 --> 00:43:56,037
He said there'd be no more
distractions from work.

557
00:43:56,457 --> 00:43:58,877
It would solve
our financial problems.

558
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:09,499
I left my shithole in Germany
and ended up stuck in his shithole.

559
00:44:09,669 --> 00:44:11,629
It's fucking absurd, isn't it? Come on!

560
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,790
- Hello.
- Hello.

561
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,500
Hi, kitten.

562
00:44:26,381 --> 00:44:27,881
This is Mrs Berger,

563
00:44:28,081 --> 00:44:30,461
appointed by the Justice Minister.

564
00:44:30,631 --> 00:44:31,881
Hello.

565
00:44:32,081 --> 00:44:33,832
Vincent Renzi, I work with Nour.

566
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:37,292
She'll be here regularly, with...

567
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,832
Daniel, and with you.

568
00:44:40,422 --> 00:44:42,383
The frequency will be specified.

569
00:44:42,543 --> 00:44:44,463
She's here...

570
00:44:45,463 --> 00:44:48,133
to ensure that everything goes well.

571
00:44:48,503 --> 00:44:52,254
And that no one
tries to influence Daniel,

572
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:56,754
or make him say things
he doesn't want to say at the trial.

573
00:44:57,384 --> 00:45:01,005
The judge says you must
speak French in her presence.

574
00:45:03,335 --> 00:45:04,385
Right.

575
00:45:07,966 --> 00:45:09,046
That's it.

576
00:45:11,086 --> 00:45:13,296
May I speak with Daniel in private?

577
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,047
OK, shall we go?

578
00:45:18,217 --> 00:45:19,217
I'll call you.

579
00:45:19,257 --> 00:45:22,427
Your mother will give us
space to get acquainted.

580
00:45:29,138 --> 00:45:30,798
My name is Marge.

581
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:33,269
We'll see each other a lot.

582
00:45:34,219 --> 00:45:36,139
Do you know why I'm here?

583
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:38,259
Are you OK with it?

584
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:41,550
You can consider me a friend.

585
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,840
Or not. That's your choice.

586
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:46,010
What do you think?

587
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,430
It's OK, I don't...

588
00:45:49,391 --> 00:45:51,511
I don't need us to be friends.

589
00:45:54,931 --> 00:45:57,762
Well, I'm here
to protect your testimony.

590
00:45:58,342 --> 00:46:00,552
The law sent me, and...

591
00:46:01,012 --> 00:46:03,392
the law can't be someone's friend.

592
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,683
Otherwise it couldn't be
someone else's friend,

593
00:46:06,843 --> 00:46:09,303
and the law must be
the same for everyone.

594
00:46:10,593 --> 00:46:13,143
So you're right,
I can't be your friend.

595
00:46:14,344 --> 00:46:17,894
You just have to tell me
if anything feels strange,

596
00:46:18,054 --> 00:46:20,804
if there's a problem,

597
00:46:20,974 --> 00:46:22,054
I don't know,

598
00:46:22,224 --> 00:46:23,975
for example with your mom,

599
00:46:24,145 --> 00:46:25,595
regarding the trial.

600
00:46:27,435 --> 00:46:31,186
I usually discuss stuff like
that with my friends.

601
00:46:33,976 --> 00:46:35,016
Right.

602
00:46:35,596 --> 00:46:38,306
Maybe this time
you don't really have a choice.

603
00:47:00,189 --> 00:47:02,399
With chocolate chips...

604
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:06,100
and raspberries...

605
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,100
I know it doesn't exist
but that's what I vow.

606
00:47:16,101 --> 00:47:18,601
The archduchess's socks...

607
00:47:20,311 --> 00:47:21,352
What?

608
00:47:22,352 --> 00:47:25,402
The archduchess's socks...

609
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:01,156
He was
one of the only persons I knew,

610
00:48:01,316 --> 00:48:02,906
when he walked into a room,

611
00:48:03,357 --> 00:48:05,197
something shifted,

612
00:48:05,357 --> 00:48:07,487
the atmosphere changed.

613
00:48:07,817 --> 00:48:10,817
And I suppose that's charm, isn't it?

614
00:48:10,987 --> 00:48:13,488
I fell in love with his charm.

615
00:48:17,698 --> 00:48:22,359
I spend my whole life
not understanding family and friends.

616
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:26,609
And then he came along,
and I felt like...

617
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:31,780
I understood what he was saying,
the signals he was sending me.

618
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,610
We didn't necessarily agree,

619
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,491
but we had...

620
00:48:39,161 --> 00:48:41,201
We had things to tell each other.

621
00:48:42,161 --> 00:48:44,781
I realized that later,
when it was gone.

622
00:48:45,452 --> 00:48:47,202
Don't say it's gone.

623
00:48:48,162 --> 00:48:50,112
Just focus on him.

624
00:48:50,992 --> 00:48:52,282
How you met.

625
00:48:54,283 --> 00:48:58,033
When we met, he'd just gotten a job
at a university in London.

626
00:48:59,533 --> 00:49:01,283
So... we moved there together.

627
00:49:03,244 --> 00:49:05,204
He was a great teacher.

628
00:49:05,704 --> 00:49:09,864
He had a way of making everything
sound alive and accessible,

629
00:49:10,034 --> 00:49:11,285
it was great.

630
00:49:14,165 --> 00:49:16,365
But some...
But that wasn't really enough,

631
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:18,205
so...

632
00:49:18,916 --> 00:49:22,286
Deep down, what he really wanted
to do was to write.

633
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:25,496
He was working on a novel for years.

634
00:49:25,666 --> 00:49:27,667
I watched him struggle, it was hard.

635
00:49:33,327 --> 00:49:34,997
And I came to realize

636
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:39,038
his relationship with time,
with work, was...

637
00:49:40,168 --> 00:49:42,208
complicated, unlike for me...

638
00:49:42,368 --> 00:49:44,709
No,
stop comparing yourself to him.

639
00:49:44,939 --> 00:49:46,019
Just to...

640
00:49:46,169 --> 00:49:47,999
Go back to your relationship.

641
00:49:51,669 --> 00:49:56,500
Our relationship revolved
around intellectual stimulation,

642
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:59,120
even if it meant
neglecting everything else.

643
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:00,961
Everything else?

644
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:02,791
Meaning Daniel?

645
00:50:04,771 --> 00:50:06,601
We should mention Daniel
early on.

646
00:50:07,081 --> 00:50:08,621
The accident.

647
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:10,922
OK. I didn't know it was so...

648
00:50:15,042 --> 00:50:16,672
- It's OK?
- It's OK.

649
00:50:17,423 --> 00:50:20,713
It's just that I didn't know
that it was so...

650
00:50:21,293 --> 00:50:22,623
like this, OK.

651
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:29,044
Everything changed
after the accident.

652
00:50:30,674 --> 00:50:32,124
Daniel was four.

653
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:38,965
That day, Samuel was supposed
to pick him up from school.

654
00:50:39,425 --> 00:50:42,255
But he was on a roll
with his writing, so...

655
00:50:42,756 --> 00:50:46,876
he called a babysitter last minute,
and she showed up late.

656
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,386
As they were crossing the street,

657
00:50:49,486 --> 00:50:50,856
a motorcycle hit Daniel.

658
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,797
His optic nerve
was permanently damaged.

659
00:50:58,967 --> 00:51:00,178
After that,

660
00:51:01,178 --> 00:51:04,128
Samuel became obsessive about it,

661
00:51:04,298 --> 00:51:06,008
he blamed himself on a loop.

662
00:51:06,178 --> 00:51:08,379
If only he'd gone,
picked him up in time...

663
00:51:10,929 --> 00:51:13,379
He was overcome with guilt.

664
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,800
Perhaps he never
truly escaped that feeling.

665
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,010
We spent that whole year
at the hospital,

666
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,931
with Daniel.

667
00:51:26,221 --> 00:51:28,761
We began having financial problems

668
00:51:30,181 --> 00:51:33,382
and Samuel started
taking antidepressants.

669
00:51:35,302 --> 00:51:37,722
Can we please keep that clean,
Vincent?

670
00:51:37,882 --> 00:51:41,803
I'd really like to protect him
and his image, and spare Daniel.

671
00:51:44,183 --> 00:51:45,263
We'll try.

672
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:46,593
OK.

673
00:51:47,053 --> 00:51:49,433
But it will be like that,
I have to...

674
00:51:50,514 --> 00:51:52,974
I have to admit things.

675
00:51:55,054 --> 00:51:57,514
You have to prepare yourself

676
00:51:58,185 --> 00:52:01,635
to tell everything, and the challenge
is to do it in French.

677
00:52:03,805 --> 00:52:05,265
OK.

678
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:48,731
One year later.

679
00:52:50,771 --> 00:52:52,601
Are you really interested in...

680
00:52:52,771 --> 00:52:55,481
What interests you?
Come on, sure.

681
00:52:56,391 --> 00:52:58,772
I never see anybody,
I work here all day long,

682
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:01,352
you come to see me,
of course you interest me.

683
00:53:04,602 --> 00:53:05,773
I run.

684
00:53:06,273 --> 00:53:08,603
It's one of my favorite things to do.

685
00:53:08,773 --> 00:53:11,023
Makes me feel high,
like I'm on drugs.

686
00:53:12,483 --> 00:53:15,644
What do you know about drugs?
That's the next question.

687
00:53:17,234 --> 00:53:18,354
Big subject.

688
00:53:19,314 --> 00:53:20,984
Maybe don't write everything down.

689
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:22,775
No surely not.

690
00:53:27,315 --> 00:53:30,816
I told you,
we should have done this in Grenoble.

691
00:53:31,696 --> 00:53:32,696
It's fine.

692
00:53:32,816 --> 00:53:34,486
I'll write your answers down.

693
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:43,317
Do you confirm this is your
interview with Mrs Voyter?

694
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:44,607
Yes.

695
00:53:44,817 --> 00:53:48,358
She refuses to talk about herself,
yet that's why you came.

696
00:53:48,528 --> 00:53:50,818
I came to talk about her work.

697
00:53:50,988 --> 00:53:54,318
Right, but by constantly
changing the subject,

698
00:53:54,488 --> 00:53:57,239
what was she looking for,
do you suppose?

699
00:53:57,699 --> 00:54:00,779
We can hear it.
She asks about me.

700
00:54:01,449 --> 00:54:05,530
She seemed to enjoy talking about me
more than herself.

701
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:09,030
Was she inciting you
to talk about yourself?

702
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:10,820
Inciting...

703
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,361
No, I wouldn't say that.

704
00:54:13,531 --> 00:54:15,951
She wasn't manipulative,
just relaxed.

705
00:54:16,111 --> 00:54:19,531
It felt natural.
She seemed to enjoy the conversation.

706
00:54:19,761 --> 00:54:23,962
You say "relaxed".
We hear her serve you wine at 1:45.

707
00:54:24,112 --> 00:54:26,652
Had she been drinking
before you arrived?

708
00:54:27,402 --> 00:54:28,402
I think so.

709
00:54:28,452 --> 00:54:31,453
Would you say she did her utmost

710
00:54:31,613 --> 00:54:32,993
to make you comfortable,

711
00:54:33,153 --> 00:54:37,784
more than you might've expected
when interviewing a writer?

712
00:54:37,994 --> 00:54:40,614
I wouldn't say that, no.

713
00:54:40,784 --> 00:54:43,784
It seemed like Sandra... Mrs Voyter,

714
00:54:43,954 --> 00:54:46,865
needed to escape, to relax.

715
00:54:47,035 --> 00:54:48,035
- Escape?
- Right.

716
00:54:48,245 --> 00:54:51,905
Did you know that Sandra,
as you call her, was bisexual?

717
00:54:53,705 --> 00:54:54,706
No.

718
00:54:54,746 --> 00:54:56,406
Did you sense it?

719
00:54:56,576 --> 00:54:57,706
No.

720
00:54:58,616 --> 00:55:02,456
Hearing the conversation now,
with hindsight,

721
00:55:03,407 --> 00:55:05,247
would you call it seduction?

722
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:10,958
I felt, and she told me herself,
that she didn't have

723
00:55:11,118 --> 00:55:14,658
much of a social life
or many chances to talk

724
00:55:14,868 --> 00:55:16,158
to new people.

725
00:55:16,328 --> 00:55:20,249
I suppose you could call that
a form of seduction.

726
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:24,659
The court needs to know
if you would call it that.

727
00:55:25,579 --> 00:55:27,079
Seduction means several things.

728
00:55:27,249 --> 00:55:30,040
But the word seduction
always implies some...

729
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,540
seduction.

730
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,910
The witness's answer

731
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,871
is clear enough,
as to what she means by seduction.

732
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:40,501
Mrs Voyter kept expressing
her interest in you.

733
00:55:40,661 --> 00:55:43,211
She wanted to do the interview
in Grenoble.

734
00:55:43,961 --> 00:55:44,962
Didn't you sense...

735
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:46,622
She answered that question.

736
00:55:46,792 --> 00:55:49,292
Not very clearly.
Please answer, Miss Solidor.

737
00:55:49,712 --> 00:55:51,462
Could you call me Mrs?

738
00:55:52,002 --> 00:55:54,503
I dislike being reduced
to a marital status.

739
00:55:54,663 --> 00:55:56,833
Of course.
That wasn't my intention.

740
00:55:57,163 --> 00:55:59,463
I didn't feel seduced in the moment.

741
00:55:59,623 --> 00:56:02,294
So you did wonder afterwards?

742
00:56:03,334 --> 00:56:05,714
I found it atypical, nothing more.

743
00:56:05,914 --> 00:56:10,045
How did you interpret the song
Samuel Maleski played?

744
00:56:11,255 --> 00:56:13,255
I felt tension around the noise.

745
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:17,795
Samuel Maleski imposing
his presence without showing himself.

746
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:19,666
And Sandra's reaction...

747
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,416
What was her reaction?

748
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,416
She was a bit annoyed.

749
00:56:26,086 --> 00:56:28,667
And when the song started over?

750
00:56:29,297 --> 00:56:31,007
He was playing it on a loop.

751
00:56:32,297 --> 00:56:33,757
Clearly...

752
00:56:34,217 --> 00:56:35,418
good deduction.

753
00:56:35,588 --> 00:56:38,588
But how did it feel to you
in the moment?

754
00:56:39,258 --> 00:56:40,878
It added to the strangeness.

755
00:56:41,628 --> 00:56:44,129
I felt my presence was less...

756
00:56:45,659 --> 00:56:47,019
It was less relaxed.

757
00:56:47,129 --> 00:56:48,839
So you clearly felt tension.

758
00:56:49,009 --> 00:56:51,760
- You're nitpicking.
- No, just clarifying.

759
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,630
Did you feel tension?

760
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,880
Yes.

761
00:56:56,470 --> 00:57:00,131
Did you feel that Mr. Maleski,
by playing that music,

762
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,801
wanted to disrupt, or interrupt,
your interview?

763
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:06,291
That was my first thought, yes.

764
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:11,722
But it's hard to read the intentions
of someone you can't see.

765
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:14,172
That's what they pay me for!

766
00:57:16,012 --> 00:57:17,303
Sandra Voyter,

767
00:57:17,803 --> 00:57:20,883
you sought a connection
to divert the interview.

768
00:57:21,113 --> 00:57:22,483
Correct?

769
00:57:22,633 --> 00:57:24,173
That's a leading question.

770
00:57:24,343 --> 00:57:26,054
There was no seduction.

771
00:57:26,384 --> 00:57:28,424
My question concerns your connection.

772
00:57:28,594 --> 00:57:32,674
In the recording you're chummy,
laughing, drinking wine.

773
00:57:32,844 --> 00:57:35,845
Were you seeking escape
from a difficult home-life

774
00:57:36,015 --> 00:57:38,095
by connecting with this young woman?

775
00:57:38,265 --> 00:57:40,845
Mrs Voyter
did not initiate the meeting.

776
00:57:41,055 --> 00:57:43,016
Please answer, Mrs Voyter.

777
00:57:44,846 --> 00:57:47,176
Yes, I found her surprising.

778
00:57:47,346 --> 00:57:50,177
I hadn't seen anyone new in a while.

779
00:57:50,347 --> 00:57:52,637
And yes, I needed a drink.

780
00:57:52,807 --> 00:57:56,977
This person was intelligent and nice,
nothing more.

781
00:57:57,847 --> 00:58:01,678
That interview was hardly enough
to base a thesis on!

782
00:58:01,848 --> 00:58:06,388
She can have a laugh with a student
whose questions don't thrill her.

783
00:58:06,558 --> 00:58:09,639
Would you say the music
Mr. Maleski played

784
00:58:09,809 --> 00:58:11,809
so aggressively

785
00:58:11,979 --> 00:58:13,849
indicated he was jealous of you,

786
00:58:14,019 --> 00:58:16,180
or Miss... Mrs Solidor? Sorry.

787
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:19,060
The music was a cover
of 50 Cent's P.I.M.P.,

788
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,480
a deeply misogynistic song.

789
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,430
It was an instrumental version.

790
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,061
Answer, please.

791
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:29,061
Could your husband's song choice
express his jealousy?

792
00:58:29,231 --> 00:58:30,231
I can answer.

793
00:58:31,681 --> 00:58:35,182
He often played that song.
I doubt it was intentional.

794
00:58:36,232 --> 00:58:39,432
He loved loud music, it relaxed him.

795
00:58:41,103 --> 00:58:43,933
He had purposefully installed...

796
00:58:45,393 --> 00:58:47,273
What is a "speaker"? Sorry.

797
00:58:48,273 --> 00:58:50,894
A powerful speaker... sorry.

798
00:58:51,684 --> 00:58:53,644
He worked a lot, it was noisy...

799
00:58:53,854 --> 00:58:57,184
Mrs Solidor says
you ended the interview over that.

800
00:58:57,355 --> 00:58:59,815
- Is that true?
- She never said that.

801
00:58:59,985 --> 00:59:01,285
If the defense

802
00:59:01,895 --> 00:59:05,065
keeps reacting to every question,

803
00:59:05,235 --> 00:59:07,146
I'll be very irritated.

804
00:59:08,276 --> 00:59:10,236
Mrs Voyter, answer the question.

805
00:59:12,896 --> 00:59:15,527
The music was just very loud.

806
00:59:15,687 --> 00:59:17,857
And when it started over,

807
00:59:18,027 --> 00:59:21,067
I realized it wasn't going to stop.

808
00:59:22,568 --> 00:59:25,528
That made discussion difficult.

809
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:27,568
So I...

810
00:59:28,608 --> 00:59:30,068
I preferred to stop.

811
00:59:30,688 --> 00:59:32,989
And I was tired, yes.

812
00:59:33,149 --> 00:59:34,399
And I felt a bit...

813
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,109
woozy, from the wine.

814
00:59:38,859 --> 00:59:42,400
Yet once alone, you didn't ask
him to explain his behavior?

815
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:46,400
As I said, it was habitual.

816
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:47,901
No.

817
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:51,241
You entertaining
an attractive young woman

818
00:59:51,401 --> 00:59:54,901
while he toiled upstairs
was neither habitual, nor neutral.

819
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:57,902
He knew you liked women.
You'd recently cheated.

820
00:59:58,072 --> 00:59:59,652
That's beside the point.

821
00:59:59,882 --> 01:00:00,772
And sexist.

822
01:00:00,862 --> 01:00:03,732
I'd have said the same
if she were an attractive man.

823
01:00:03,862 --> 01:00:07,573
Excuse me, but this couple's
conflicts matter here.

824
01:00:07,783 --> 01:00:10,653
There's something
a bit strange in this situation.

825
01:00:10,823 --> 01:00:14,404
You say you went upstairs
to your room to work and sleep.

826
01:00:14,574 --> 01:00:18,074
Right below the attic
with the deafening music.

827
01:00:18,244 --> 01:00:21,405
Music that had made
the interview impossible.

828
01:00:21,575 --> 01:00:23,825
In that big house,
you chose that spot?

829
01:00:24,035 --> 01:00:27,785
Yes, that's where I work.
I always work in bed.

830
01:00:30,246 --> 01:00:33,496
When Samuel came to talk to you,
you didn't complain?

831
01:00:33,656 --> 01:00:36,946
Deafening music overhead
is hardly normal.

832
01:00:38,867 --> 01:00:40,367
I'm used to it, I don't mind.

833
01:00:40,537 --> 01:00:43,287
I wanted to work, I had my earplugs.

834
01:00:43,447 --> 01:00:44,497
It was normal.

835
01:00:45,287 --> 01:00:47,288
I can work in any situation.

836
01:00:47,498 --> 01:00:50,158
You said you were tired,
woozy from the wine.

837
01:00:50,328 --> 01:00:52,198
Yet you wanted to work?

838
01:00:52,408 --> 01:00:53,408
Yes.

839
01:00:53,538 --> 01:00:55,289
And I did. Not for long.

840
01:00:55,449 --> 01:00:56,999
A translation was due.

841
01:00:57,159 --> 01:00:59,409
I wanted to finish it before resting.

842
01:00:59,999 --> 01:01:04,040
As I said, I can work
in any environment, any condition.

843
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:07,410
Apparently you can also rest
anywhere, anytime.

844
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,700
So all was well with the world.

845
01:01:14,791 --> 01:01:15,811
That's all.

846
01:01:19,411 --> 01:01:20,792
No further questions.

847
01:01:23,872 --> 01:01:26,042
Daniel, that's not what you told us.

848
01:01:26,202 --> 01:01:29,123
Zoe Solidor saw you
leave the house after she left.

849
01:01:29,293 --> 01:01:32,583
And your mom says
she spoke to your dad after that.

850
01:01:34,203 --> 01:01:35,413
I got mixed up.

851
01:01:36,253 --> 01:01:37,504
You got mixed up.

852
01:01:43,754 --> 01:01:45,955
Indeed there is a problem, Daniel.

853
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:47,125
Right?

854
01:01:47,255 --> 01:01:49,955
You couldn't be two places at once.

855
01:01:51,455 --> 01:01:53,836
I think I went back inside.

856
01:01:56,586 --> 01:02:00,756
What bothers me is how sure you were
before the reenactment.

857
01:02:01,126 --> 01:02:03,337
You said in your statement:

858
01:02:03,507 --> 01:02:06,257
"Each piece of tape feels different."

859
01:02:06,417 --> 01:02:09,127
"I wouldn't get it wrong."

860
01:02:09,757 --> 01:02:12,418
And:
"I was just below the open window."

861
01:02:12,588 --> 01:02:14,418
"I know what I heard."

862
01:02:14,588 --> 01:02:18,168
Then, during the reenactment,
you said something else entirely.

863
01:02:18,338 --> 01:02:19,959
How come?

864
01:02:22,669 --> 01:02:25,709
I thought
I remembered where I was, but...

865
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:31,960
Maybe the shock of what happened next
got me mixed up.

866
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,460
A psychiatrist who met with Daniel

867
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:38,421
says emotional shock
may have altered some memories.

868
01:02:38,871 --> 01:02:39,781
Of course.

869
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:42,711
Do you remember now
why you came back inside?

870
01:02:44,922 --> 01:02:46,922
I think I must've forgotten...

871
01:02:47,592 --> 01:02:49,212
my gloves or my phone.

872
01:02:50,092 --> 01:02:51,422
But you're not sure?

873
01:02:52,923 --> 01:02:54,673
I don't remember exactly.

874
01:02:54,843 --> 01:02:58,343
So, you went from absolute certainty
to uncertainty

875
01:02:58,513 --> 01:03:00,924
about your memories of that day.

876
01:03:01,094 --> 01:03:03,014
This is very problematic.

877
01:03:03,174 --> 01:03:06,174
You're fixating on one detail
in his memory

878
01:03:06,344 --> 01:03:08,885
to cast doubt on his whole memory.

879
01:03:09,305 --> 01:03:11,015
What do you want us to believe?

880
01:03:11,175 --> 01:03:14,515
That shock may have turned yelling
into calm voices?

881
01:03:14,675 --> 01:03:17,596
You insinuate
he lied to protect his mother.

882
01:03:17,766 --> 01:03:18,886
No.

883
01:03:19,426 --> 01:03:21,716
I'm merely signaling
the witness's doubts.

884
01:03:21,886 --> 01:03:24,136
But we are entitled to wonder.

885
01:03:24,306 --> 01:03:28,137
Daniel Maleski says he would leave
when his parents fought.

886
01:03:28,307 --> 01:03:31,517
Whereas on that day,
he happens to go out

887
01:03:31,677 --> 01:03:34,428
right when an argument
is likely to erupt.

888
01:03:34,598 --> 01:03:36,518
Thus, he doesn't hear a thing.

889
01:03:36,968 --> 01:03:39,598
I didn't happen to go out.
I fled the music.

890
01:03:39,768 --> 01:03:43,769
And he's very precise
about what he heard.

891
01:03:43,929 --> 01:03:45,599
He's never budged on that.

892
01:03:46,179 --> 01:03:49,389
The psychiatrist
and visual impairment expert

893
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:52,810
both observed
Daniel's excellent aural memory.

894
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:02,391
Clerk, please display

895
01:04:02,561 --> 01:04:05,061
the elements provided by Mr. Balard.

896
01:04:07,431 --> 01:04:08,972
We're listening.

897
01:04:09,142 --> 01:04:12,642
The decisive element here
is the three blood spatters

898
01:04:12,872 --> 01:04:14,202
on the woodshed,

899
01:04:14,352 --> 01:04:16,973
as indicated on the sketch.

900
01:04:17,933 --> 01:04:20,683
Can we zoom in on the woodshed?

901
01:04:22,023 --> 01:04:25,814
Their shape is typical of spatter
projected from high above.

902
01:04:26,044 --> 01:04:28,294
They are long and narrow.

903
01:04:28,494 --> 01:04:32,745
The longest measures 4 centimeters,
which is a lot.

904
01:04:33,275 --> 01:04:34,935
So, according to our tests,

905
01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:37,645
these spatters
could only have landed here

906
01:04:37,815 --> 01:04:40,355
if Mr. Maleski was struck on the head

907
01:04:40,525 --> 01:04:42,936
while on the 3rd floor balcony.

908
01:04:43,976 --> 01:04:47,026
He would have to have been
leaning over the balcony,

909
01:04:47,186 --> 01:04:50,857
his head already quite far out
when the blow was struck,

910
01:04:51,027 --> 01:04:53,607
for the spatter to land there.

911
01:04:53,837 --> 01:04:55,627
No other explanation stands.

912
01:04:55,777 --> 01:04:59,688
Did the violence of the blow
make Mr. Maleski fall?

913
01:04:59,858 --> 01:05:00,978
Most likely,

914
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:04,608
it was the combination
of a violent blow

915
01:05:04,778 --> 01:05:06,859
and a deliberate push.

916
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:10,819
Would you say the aggressor
was in a state of extreme anger,

917
01:05:11,029 --> 01:05:14,650
to provoke a fall after
administering such a violent blow?

918
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:16,980
A state of rage, I'd say.

919
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:18,780
Hard to imagine anything less.

920
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:23,151
Such states
can increase physical strength.

921
01:05:34,482 --> 01:05:39,232
The guardrail is 1.2 meters high.

922
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:42,443
Comes up to about here.

923
01:05:42,943 --> 01:05:45,613
Mr. Maleski was 1.82 meters tall

924
01:05:45,783 --> 01:05:47,903
and weighed 85 kilos.

925
01:05:48,234 --> 01:05:51,284
So, pushing him over that guardrail

926
01:05:51,444 --> 01:05:55,194
would have required
a very deliberate push, right?

927
01:05:55,364 --> 01:05:58,365
The entire act was very deliberate.

928
01:05:58,535 --> 01:06:00,695
Such a blow is always intentional.

929
01:06:00,905 --> 01:06:03,035
What I mean by very deliberate is...

930
01:06:03,195 --> 01:06:05,986
very coordinated. Methodical.

931
01:06:06,156 --> 01:06:08,576
Based on his weight, we can assume

932
01:06:08,736 --> 01:06:12,196
it was necessary to lift his legs
to make him fall,

933
01:06:12,366 --> 01:06:14,327
which hardly suggests rage.

934
01:06:14,487 --> 01:06:16,197
Rage does not exclude will.

935
01:06:16,367 --> 01:06:20,537
And Mr. Maleski was probably
already off-balance.

936
01:06:20,697 --> 01:06:22,288
He may have fallen

937
01:06:22,448 --> 01:06:25,868
as much from the blow
as from his own unstable position.

938
01:06:26,078 --> 01:06:28,788
As I said,
we have no material elements...

939
01:06:28,948 --> 01:06:31,079
Except those 3 drops of blood.

940
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:37,119
Everything else must be speculated
to explain those drops, right?

941
01:06:37,289 --> 01:06:40,580
OK, but the only explanation
is the one I gave.

942
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:44,140
You gave us a theory,
not an explanation.

943
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:45,740
Actually, two theories.

944
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:49,041
With and without a deliberate push.

945
01:06:49,741 --> 01:06:51,411
According to your theories,

946
01:06:51,621 --> 01:06:53,661
what type of object was used?

947
01:06:53,831 --> 01:06:56,412
A heavy object, probably in metal

948
01:06:56,622 --> 01:06:58,582
or dense wood,

949
01:06:58,742 --> 01:07:00,952
and undoubtedly with a sharp edge.

950
01:07:01,492 --> 01:07:05,043
Did you examine any such objects
found on the premises?

951
01:07:05,203 --> 01:07:07,833
You know no weapon was found.

952
01:07:07,993 --> 01:07:09,793
They're easily disposed of.

953
01:07:10,413 --> 01:07:11,954
No further questions.

954
01:07:14,124 --> 01:07:17,044
Two possible explanations
for these 3 spatters.

955
01:07:17,204 --> 01:07:21,335
Either they came from here,
after a violent blow.

956
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:24,745
Or they resulted when the skull

957
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:26,585
hit this roof ledge,

958
01:07:26,795 --> 01:07:28,205
approximately here.

959
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:30,376
The first hypothesis is unlikely.

960
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:34,996
It's inconsistent with the shape
and movement of the spatters.

961
01:07:35,976 --> 01:07:37,767
Focusing on the second hypothesis,

962
01:07:37,917 --> 01:07:41,667
we must take into account
the bounce caused by the impact

963
01:07:41,837 --> 01:07:43,167
on the roof ledge.

964
01:07:43,997 --> 01:07:47,168
I'll show you a video
of our in-situ tests.

965
01:07:52,688 --> 01:07:53,598
There.

966
01:07:53,668 --> 01:07:57,419
As you can see
in our reenactment with a dummy,

967
01:07:57,649 --> 01:08:00,769
such an impact
causes the body to turn abruptly.

968
01:08:00,919 --> 01:08:04,380
And during that rollover, or spin,

969
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,880
a fraction of a second after impact,

970
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:10,921
these 3 spatters are projected

971
01:08:11,151 --> 01:08:12,601
onto this surface.

972
01:08:16,211 --> 01:08:18,001
The only valid explanation

973
01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:21,712
is that Mr. Maleski
fell from the attic window.

974
01:08:21,882 --> 01:08:23,172
I believe it's the only way

975
01:08:23,382 --> 01:08:25,672
he could've bounced off the roof,

976
01:08:26,152 --> 01:08:27,733
and sustained such an injury.

977
01:08:27,883 --> 01:08:30,253
You use the cautious qualifier
"I believe".

978
01:08:30,423 --> 01:08:31,713
So it's your opinion.

979
01:08:32,303 --> 01:08:35,053
How do you explain
the lack of DNA or trace tissue

980
01:08:35,253 --> 01:08:38,634
at the point of impact,
or "bounce" as you call it?

981
01:08:39,134 --> 01:08:40,714
I'll show you.

982
01:08:40,884 --> 01:08:43,004
This is a test we carried out

983
01:08:43,234 --> 01:08:45,315
under comparable conditions.

984
01:08:45,465 --> 01:08:48,635
At the time of the incident,
there was a layer of ice

985
01:08:48,805 --> 01:08:51,465
underneath a thick layer of snow.

986
01:08:52,676 --> 01:08:55,846
We see the snow melting
in acceleration.

987
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:57,346
And we can see,

988
01:08:57,506 --> 01:09:01,427
during 1 hour and 50 minutes,
that the runoff

989
01:09:01,927 --> 01:09:05,557
takes with it all residue
embedded at the point of impact.

990
01:09:05,637 --> 01:09:07,427
It ends up with the blood
that was already

991
01:09:07,527 --> 01:09:08,607
down here.

992
01:09:08,757 --> 01:09:12,388
You call the violent blow hypothesis
"improbable".

993
01:09:12,558 --> 01:09:14,508
Would you call it impossible?

994
01:09:15,808 --> 01:09:17,678
No, but highly improbable.

995
01:09:17,849 --> 01:09:19,509
Meaning it is possible.

996
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:22,679
As it's possible
I'll be president someday.

997
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,279
I know the definition.

998
01:09:24,429 --> 01:09:25,889
It's improbable for a reason.

999
01:09:26,059 --> 01:09:29,220
In your hypothesis,
in order to explain the angle

1000
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:30,860
of these 3 spatters,

1001
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:34,390
we have to imagine
that Mr. Maleski's head

1002
01:09:34,561 --> 01:09:38,101
was leaning way out,
around 80 cm past the guardrail.

1003
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:41,221
This implies the aggressor forced him

1004
01:09:41,431 --> 01:09:43,432
to lean backwards over the void,

1005
01:09:44,012 --> 01:09:46,472
shoving him against the guardrail,

1006
01:09:46,642 --> 01:09:49,642
his entire torso pitched backwards.

1007
01:09:49,972 --> 01:09:54,313
The aggressor would have
to be leaning very far out

1008
01:09:54,513 --> 01:09:56,893
while holding a heavy object

1009
01:09:57,063 --> 01:10:00,224
and striking the victim
with powerful momentum.

1010
01:10:00,394 --> 01:10:01,684
All these elements,

1011
01:10:01,854 --> 01:10:04,724
in addition to
the defendant's body mass,

1012
01:10:04,894 --> 01:10:07,064
make this hypothesis highly improbable.

1013
01:10:07,224 --> 01:10:08,395
But not impossible.

1014
01:10:12,815 --> 01:10:15,935
Listen Daniel,
I asked to see you because...

1015
01:10:16,105 --> 01:10:19,356
I know you have a vested interest
in this case.

1016
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:22,226
I've allowed you
to attend the trial so far.

1017
01:10:22,396 --> 01:10:23,766
But tomorrow will be

1018
01:10:23,996 --> 01:10:25,787
far more complicated.

1019
01:10:25,937 --> 01:10:28,727
We'll be covering
some disturbing details,

1020
01:10:28,897 --> 01:10:31,397
so I've decided
you won't be attending.

1021
01:10:32,517 --> 01:10:34,188
I think I can hear anything.

1022
01:10:34,358 --> 01:10:35,188
What?

1023
01:10:35,358 --> 01:10:37,318
I think I can hear anything.

1024
01:10:37,728 --> 01:10:39,518
- Yeah?
- I'm prepared.

1025
01:10:39,688 --> 01:10:42,769
You can hear it,
but can you handle it?

1026
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:44,519
We have a job to do.

1027
01:10:44,689 --> 01:10:48,269
We need to be able to work...
with serenity.

1028
01:10:48,439 --> 01:10:50,070
I've never disrupted the trial.

1029
01:10:50,230 --> 01:10:51,730
Disrupted...

1030
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:53,770
That's not the point.

1031
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:58,401
We need to be able
to evoke the facts bluntly.

1032
01:10:59,651 --> 01:11:01,731
We have to address everything,

1033
01:11:01,901 --> 01:11:04,271
without fear of hurting you.

1034
01:11:06,982 --> 01:11:08,732
I've already been hurt.

1035
01:11:10,442 --> 01:11:12,652
And that's why I need...

1036
01:11:14,022 --> 01:11:16,193
to hear, so I can get past it.

1037
01:11:16,363 --> 01:11:18,483
The trial is not about you hearing.

1038
01:11:18,653 --> 01:11:21,023
It's about establishing the truth,

1039
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:23,944
without being forced
to censor ourselves.

1040
01:11:24,404 --> 01:11:26,904
When has anyone
censored themselves?

1041
01:11:28,094 --> 01:11:30,754
Even if you forbid me to come,

1042
01:11:31,154 --> 01:11:33,695
I'll find out.
I'll know what happened

1043
01:11:33,865 --> 01:11:35,695
from TV, radio, internet.

1044
01:11:36,575 --> 01:11:38,195
I'll be obsessed.

1045
01:11:50,277 --> 01:11:52,117
Mrs Voyter, you claim

1046
01:11:52,327 --> 01:11:55,657
your husband attempted suicide
6 months before he died.

1047
01:11:56,027 --> 01:11:59,198
You remembered late,
which is quite surprising.

1048
01:11:59,368 --> 01:12:02,328
Can you describe
the episode in detail?

1049
01:12:02,488 --> 01:12:03,658
Yes.

1050
01:12:09,489 --> 01:12:13,990
It happened a few weeks
after he stopped his medication.

1051
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,620
I found him lying on the floor...

1052
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,990
early in the morning, in his room.

1053
01:12:22,741 --> 01:12:23,911
He'd...

1054
01:12:24,281 --> 01:12:26,031
had a lot to drink..

1055
01:12:26,781 --> 01:12:29,491
The night before, and passed out.

1056
01:12:31,082 --> 01:12:34,492
He'd vomited,
and in the vomit, I saw aspirin.

1057
01:12:35,372 --> 01:12:38,742
The pills had nearly dissolved.

1058
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:43,623
At first I didn't understand
what it was.

1059
01:12:44,373 --> 01:12:46,833
But later, I found...

1060
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:50,334
empty blister packs
in the kitchen garbage.

1061
01:12:51,454 --> 01:12:54,084
I cleaned it all up
and put him in bed.

1062
01:12:54,664 --> 01:12:55,915
Later,

1063
01:12:56,085 --> 01:12:57,705
when he felt better,

1064
01:12:57,915 --> 01:12:59,835
he didn't want to discuss it.

1065
01:12:59,995 --> 01:13:02,785
He just said he'd
stopped his meds too soon.

1066
01:13:04,456 --> 01:13:06,416
You had separate bedrooms?

1067
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:10,836
It was his office,
and he usually slept there, yes.

1068
01:13:12,497 --> 01:13:16,787
I see. What made you
go into his room so early?

1069
01:13:16,957 --> 01:13:19,497
I wake up very early.
He did too, sometimes.

1070
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:22,918
We occasionally spent that time
together, talking.

1071
01:13:23,088 --> 01:13:24,498
At 6 in the morning?

1072
01:13:24,668 --> 01:13:27,128
Yes, if I saw the light on. Yes.

1073
01:13:27,918 --> 01:13:30,999
We'd stopped sharing a bed,
but we were very close.

1074
01:13:31,169 --> 01:13:32,999
I would often...

1075
01:13:34,089 --> 01:13:37,089
finish the night with him,
in the office bed.

1076
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:40,500
I'd gone down to make coffee.

1077
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:43,670
I saw his door was ajar, and...

1078
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:46,251
I saw him lying on the floor.

1079
01:13:46,671 --> 01:13:48,841
No one else witnessed that?

1080
01:13:48,961 --> 01:13:49,961
No.

1081
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:52,711
Thank you, you may sit down.

1082
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:56,382
Did you know that?

1083
01:13:58,172 --> 01:13:59,922
Which antidepressant
did you prescribe?

1084
01:14:00,092 --> 01:14:01,842
Escitalopram, 20 mg per day.

1085
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:04,093
- Was it his choice to stop?
- Yes.

1086
01:14:04,503 --> 01:14:07,713
About 7 months before he died
he wanted to wean off.

1087
01:14:07,883 --> 01:14:11,674
I recommended a tapering plan
with weekly check-ins.

1088
01:14:11,844 --> 01:14:13,344
Any suicidal ideation?

1089
01:14:14,094 --> 01:14:16,004
No, Samuel wasn't depressive.

1090
01:14:16,174 --> 01:14:19,344
I'd prescribed Escitalopram
as an emotional shield

1091
01:14:20,175 --> 01:14:22,885
to help him cope
after his son's accident.

1092
01:14:23,045 --> 01:14:27,505
Can sudden withdrawal from a low dose
trigger a suicide attempt?

1093
01:14:28,366 --> 01:14:30,616
Anything's possible in theory,

1094
01:14:30,756 --> 01:14:35,006
but why would he have asked me
to help him wean off,

1095
01:14:35,176 --> 01:14:38,097
then stop behind my back?
Makes no sense.

1096
01:14:38,257 --> 01:14:41,097
And no mention of it
in our weekly sessions?

1097
01:14:54,179 --> 01:14:57,389
Have you ever had a patient
commit suicide,

1098
01:14:57,619 --> 01:14:59,239
or attempt suicide?

1099
01:14:59,389 --> 01:15:01,640
In French, "committing suicide"

1100
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:05,430
means both trying and succeeding.

1101
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:06,660
It's the action.

1102
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,470
Thanks for the language lesson.

1103
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:10,401
No patient has committed suicide.

1104
01:15:10,551 --> 01:15:12,891
Aside from Mr. Maleski,

1105
01:15:13,051 --> 01:15:15,601
since we're here
to rule on the question.

1106
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,051
In any case,

1107
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:20,012
we can't consider you
an expert on suicide,

1108
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,352
failed or successful.

1109
01:15:22,102 --> 01:15:25,512
You said your husband
refused to discuss it with you,

1110
01:15:25,682 --> 01:15:27,433
or anyone else, apparently.

1111
01:15:27,603 --> 01:15:28,893
Why, do you think?

1112
01:15:31,353 --> 01:15:32,933
Because he was ashamed.

1113
01:15:33,103 --> 01:15:35,354
He had a lot of...

1114
01:15:40,054 --> 01:15:42,304
It's too complicated.
Can I change the language, please?

1115
01:15:43,895 --> 01:15:45,145
Thanks.

1116
01:15:47,055 --> 01:15:49,145
Yeah, I think because he was ashamed.

1117
01:15:50,335 --> 01:15:53,376
Samuel had
a lot of issues with shame.

1118
01:15:53,576 --> 01:15:54,906
It's complicated.

1119
01:15:58,016 --> 01:16:02,017
He was frustrated with teaching.
It had become a burden,

1120
01:16:02,727 --> 01:16:04,397
and he wanted to write.

1121
01:16:05,187 --> 01:16:07,307
He'd been working
on a novel for years,

1122
01:16:07,477 --> 01:16:09,608
before and after Daniel's accident.

1123
01:16:11,228 --> 01:16:12,518
I read everything he wrote.

1124
01:16:12,688 --> 01:16:14,978
I thought it was really good
and I told him so.

1125
01:16:15,438 --> 01:16:17,399
But from one day to another,
he just...

1126
01:16:17,939 --> 01:16:20,559
couldn't do it anymore,
he just stopped.

1127
01:16:22,059 --> 01:16:24,149
It made him feel like a coward.

1128
01:16:24,939 --> 01:16:27,060
He would belittle himself.

1129
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,270
He ended up convincing himself
he could not write

1130
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,441
because of his dependency
on the medication.

1131
01:16:34,611 --> 01:16:36,441
He wanted to free himself of that,

1132
01:16:36,611 --> 01:16:38,901
and he could not, of course not...

1133
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:40,691
I'm sorry, I'm not finished.

1134
01:16:40,861 --> 01:16:43,502
He could not talk about
the suicide attempt

1135
01:16:43,612 --> 01:16:47,062
because his feelings of failure
were just too painful.

1136
01:16:47,232 --> 01:16:48,942
He never spoke of that.

1137
01:16:49,112 --> 01:16:50,112
Not once.

1138
01:16:50,152 --> 01:16:53,943
He blamed you for getting him hooked
on the pills from the first session.

1139
01:16:54,113 --> 01:16:55,233
It drove him mad.

1140
01:16:55,443 --> 01:16:56,943
He and I decided together.

1141
01:16:57,113 --> 01:17:00,614
You can't deny you're at the center
of this equation.

1142
01:17:01,024 --> 01:17:04,444
Samuel came to see me
because he felt guilty,

1143
01:17:04,614 --> 01:17:07,275
but mostly because you blamed him.

1144
01:17:07,445 --> 01:17:09,865
He described your behavior

1145
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:12,115
as quite castrating.

1146
01:17:12,525 --> 01:17:14,485
You made him pay

1147
01:17:14,815 --> 01:17:16,566
for the accident

1148
01:17:16,776 --> 01:17:20,196
by forcing him to give up
what mattered most to him:

1149
01:17:20,366 --> 01:17:21,406
Writing.

1150
01:17:22,236 --> 01:17:25,657
You put him on
an emotional roller coaster.

1151
01:17:25,867 --> 01:17:28,027
On the one hand, it's true,

1152
01:17:28,197 --> 01:17:31,117
you encouraged him to write,
wanted him to succeed.

1153
01:17:31,277 --> 01:17:34,698
But if he had,
it would've been unbearable for you.

1154
01:17:34,868 --> 01:17:37,698
That's the problem.
It may have been subconscious.

1155
01:17:38,868 --> 01:17:42,199
All the material
and psychological burdens

1156
01:17:42,369 --> 01:17:44,909
resulting from the accident
were his to bear.

1157
01:17:45,069 --> 01:17:47,989
It's as though you said,
"This is your problem."

1158
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,160
"You're responsible. Deal with it."

1159
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,160
"I want to free myself from that,
to write."

1160
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,910
Material burdens

1161
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:58,201
were managed by Mrs Voyter
as much as her husband.

1162
01:17:58,371 --> 01:18:01,781
We have their bank statements,
receipts, etc.

1163
01:18:01,991 --> 01:18:04,621
I'm also talking about
the emotional load.

1164
01:18:04,781 --> 01:18:07,492
Responsibilities, sense of purpose,

1165
01:18:08,162 --> 01:18:09,372
anxiety.

1166
01:18:09,532 --> 01:18:13,952
In those areas,
Samuel felt an unbearable imbalance.

1167
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:16,493
So what your patients
tell you is the truth?

1168
01:18:16,663 --> 01:18:18,783
As a psychoanalyst,

1169
01:18:18,953 --> 01:18:21,663
you never wondered
whether Samuel Maleski

1170
01:18:21,823 --> 01:18:25,534
might've needed to imagine
an unbearable imbalance

1171
01:18:25,704 --> 01:18:27,704
to prevent himself from writing?

1172
01:18:27,874 --> 01:18:31,875
After a while, I can tell
what's real and what isn't.

1173
01:18:32,075 --> 01:18:33,285
Lucky you.

1174
01:18:33,455 --> 01:18:35,205
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1175
01:18:35,625 --> 01:18:36,915
But...

1176
01:18:37,285 --> 01:18:39,706
I don't know. You come here,

1177
01:18:39,876 --> 01:18:43,326
OK, with maybe your opinion,
and you tell me

1178
01:18:44,416 --> 01:18:48,247
who Samuel was
and what we were going through.

1179
01:18:48,917 --> 01:18:52,247
But what you say is just

1180
01:18:52,827 --> 01:18:55,827
a little part of the whole situation.

1181
01:18:56,378 --> 01:18:57,498
You know.

1182
01:18:58,078 --> 01:18:59,458
I mean, sometimes,

1183
01:19:00,128 --> 01:19:01,498
sometimes a couple...

1184
01:19:03,078 --> 01:19:04,919
is kind of a chaos

1185
01:19:05,079 --> 01:19:07,079
and everybody is lost.

1186
01:19:07,249 --> 01:19:10,039
Sometimes we fight together
and sometimes we fight alone,

1187
01:19:10,209 --> 01:19:13,460
and sometimes we fight against
each other, that happens.

1188
01:19:13,630 --> 01:19:16,630
And I think it's possible that Samuel

1189
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,670
needed to see things
the way you describe them, but...

1190
01:19:22,211 --> 01:19:24,211
If I'd been seeing a therapist,

1191
01:19:24,381 --> 01:19:28,461
he could stand here too and say
very ugly things about Samuel.

1192
01:19:28,631 --> 01:19:30,632
But would those things be true?

1193
01:19:39,293 --> 01:19:43,543
Did you resent your husband
after your son's accident?

1194
01:19:47,084 --> 01:19:49,294
We were both dealing with

1195
01:19:49,464 --> 01:19:52,584
very different emotions at that time.

1196
01:19:53,924 --> 01:19:55,505
Yes or no?

1197
01:19:58,255 --> 01:19:59,835
Yes, for a few days.

1198
01:20:00,335 --> 01:20:02,215
Daniel was on his watch.

1199
01:20:03,386 --> 01:20:06,256
Your son practically lost his sight,

1200
01:20:06,636 --> 01:20:09,086
and you only resented him
for a few days?

1201
01:20:10,216 --> 01:20:13,587
Yes, about his responsibility
for the accident. Yes.

1202
01:20:14,507 --> 01:20:15,677
Of course.

1203
01:20:16,717 --> 01:20:21,798
I mean, maybe. The doctor earlier said
something about a tragic situation.

1204
01:20:22,218 --> 01:20:25,218
I immediately refused
to see it that way.

1205
01:20:25,588 --> 01:20:28,258
I never saw Daniel as handicapped.

1206
01:20:29,089 --> 01:20:32,429
You know, I wanted to protect
him from that perception.

1207
01:20:32,589 --> 01:20:36,259
Because, as soon as you mark a child
that way, you condemn him to now

1208
01:20:36,429 --> 01:20:39,180
to not see his life as his own,

1209
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:42,050
whereas he should feel
that it's his best life

1210
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:43,840
because it's the only life he's got,

1211
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:45,341
it is his own.

1212
01:20:47,641 --> 01:20:49,011
He reads books,

1213
01:20:50,091 --> 01:20:52,551
he goes on social media
like any other kid

1214
01:20:52,721 --> 01:20:54,092
he plays the piano,

1215
01:20:54,262 --> 01:20:56,182
he dreams, he cries, he laughs.

1216
01:20:56,342 --> 01:20:58,342
He's a very lively kid.

1217
01:20:58,682 --> 01:20:59,892
He's OK.

1218
01:21:00,972 --> 01:21:02,143
Yeah.

1219
01:21:04,263 --> 01:21:06,553
So perhaps, I...

1220
01:21:08,183 --> 01:21:12,344
I resented Samuel for projecting
his own pain onto Daniel, yes.

1221
01:21:15,304 --> 01:21:16,304
Thank you.

1222
01:21:37,057 --> 01:21:39,187
I want to drink all night.

1223
01:21:40,517 --> 01:21:41,687
Yeah, same.

1224
01:21:42,517 --> 01:21:43,807
I will drink.

1225
01:21:44,558 --> 01:21:45,688
To forget.

1226
01:21:45,898 --> 01:21:47,978
Come on. You're the only lawyer...

1227
01:21:50,518 --> 01:21:51,768
OK, once again.

1228
01:21:51,938 --> 01:21:54,479
No, you're really
the only lawyer I know.

1229
01:21:55,939 --> 01:21:59,439
Is it a great reason for putting
your life in someone's hands?

1230
01:21:59,849 --> 01:22:01,730
- Is it?
- No, but you're good too.

1231
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:03,900
Right? You're good.

1232
01:22:04,060 --> 01:22:05,520
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on.

1233
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,020
You look like a dog.

1234
01:22:10,311 --> 01:22:11,481
Excuse me?

1235
01:22:11,651 --> 01:22:13,401
No, a beautiful dog.

1236
01:22:14,401 --> 01:22:15,731
How do you say it?

1237
01:22:16,771 --> 01:22:18,352
A basset?

1238
01:22:18,522 --> 01:22:20,652
Funny you say that.
I can't trust someone

1239
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:23,232
if I can't put
an animal's head on them.

1240
01:22:23,442 --> 01:22:25,602
Really? So what am I?

1241
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:29,903
I'm not sure yet.

1242
01:22:33,443 --> 01:22:34,854
After all this time,

1243
01:22:35,694 --> 01:22:37,194
you still don't know?

1244
01:22:39,604 --> 01:22:40,944
OK.

1245
01:22:52,566 --> 01:22:56,526
Do you remember me from before,
when we first met?

1246
01:22:57,066 --> 01:22:58,406
Yes I do, of course.

1247
01:22:59,156 --> 01:23:01,197
I don't. What was I like?

1248
01:23:03,197 --> 01:23:05,697
You were a little bit lost,

1249
01:23:06,527 --> 01:23:08,158
as I can remember.

1250
01:23:09,358 --> 01:23:10,408
Lonely.

1251
01:23:11,448 --> 01:23:12,528
And..

1252
01:23:13,778 --> 01:23:14,908
Ambitious.

1253
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:18,569
And I was hopelessly in love.

1254
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:28,030
I can't remember a thing.

1255
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,530
OK.

1256
01:23:39,951 --> 01:23:42,242
But I'm innocent.
You know that, right?

1257
01:23:42,572 --> 01:23:43,862
Yes.

1258
01:23:44,202 --> 01:23:45,572
I mean really.

1259
01:23:48,742 --> 01:23:50,703
I don't know what you're thinking.

1260
01:23:53,323 --> 01:23:56,203
I think a lot of things
I don't tell you.

1261
01:23:56,663 --> 01:23:58,164
Otherwise you'd fire me right now.

1262
01:23:58,284 --> 01:23:59,284
No, Vincent.

1263
01:23:59,364 --> 01:24:01,364
In your head, you're thinking...

1264
01:24:01,534 --> 01:24:04,864
Sometimes when you look at me,
just like right now,

1265
01:24:05,244 --> 01:24:07,165
I can feel that you're judging me.

1266
01:24:08,665 --> 01:24:10,535
I don't know what you think.

1267
01:24:10,865 --> 01:24:12,865
Sandra, I believe you.

1268
01:24:13,575 --> 01:24:14,976
I'm not judging you.

1269
01:24:36,168 --> 01:24:37,208
My love,

1270
01:24:38,418 --> 01:24:39,748
I just want you to know...

1271
01:24:40,369 --> 01:24:41,459
I'm not...

1272
01:24:42,039 --> 01:24:45,419
I'm not that monster, you know?

1273
01:24:46,369 --> 01:24:48,750
Everything you hear in the trial,

1274
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,420
it's just...

1275
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:54,790
It's twisted. You know.

1276
01:24:55,670 --> 01:24:56,670
And...

1277
01:24:56,710 --> 01:24:58,541
It wasn't like that.

1278
01:24:59,121 --> 01:25:00,211
Your father...

1279
01:25:00,831 --> 01:25:03,081
Your father was my soulmate.

1280
01:25:03,711 --> 01:25:06,462
We chose each other, and I loved him.

1281
01:25:09,962 --> 01:25:11,832
But how do you prove that?

1282
01:25:17,713 --> 01:25:21,873
I just wish you would be shielded
from all this, that you could do...

1283
01:25:22,924 --> 01:25:26,294
that you could do children's stuff,

1284
01:25:27,004 --> 01:25:30,044
that you could be a child
just a little longer. You know.

1285
01:25:45,426 --> 01:25:46,716
All rise!

1286
01:25:55,377 --> 01:25:57,178
You may be seated.

1287
01:25:59,048 --> 01:26:03,628
We'll begin by calling the
Chief Investigator to the bar.

1288
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:10,129
He insists, it's important.

1289
01:26:56,385 --> 01:26:58,185
You may be seated.

1290
01:27:00,345 --> 01:27:02,766
The Chief Investigator
has surely arrived,

1291
01:27:02,936 --> 01:27:05,136
so we'll start with him.

1292
01:27:06,186 --> 01:27:09,726
Clerk, please cue Exhibit 31.

1293
01:27:11,887 --> 01:27:14,977
Bailiff, prepare to hand out

1294
01:27:15,137 --> 01:27:18,847
the transcription
of the recording to the jurors.

1295
01:27:25,688 --> 01:27:26,978
Clerk?

1296
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:30,439
What can I do?
It's part of the job.

1297
01:27:30,599 --> 01:27:32,639
Organize yourself differently.

1298
01:27:32,809 --> 01:27:34,059
I'm not going to cancel.

1299
01:27:34,229 --> 01:27:36,019
How can I organize on my own?

1300
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:38,730
You know
we have to plan things together.

1301
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,020
I won't leave Daniel alone
because you're gone.

1302
01:27:44,190 --> 01:27:46,391
Leave him with Monica,
what's the big deal?

1303
01:27:47,271 --> 01:27:48,271
Three days a week?

1304
01:27:48,441 --> 01:27:50,061
We'd have to pay her for that.

1305
01:27:50,231 --> 01:27:51,771
We can't afford it.

1306
01:27:54,642 --> 01:27:56,102
I need time.

1307
01:27:56,312 --> 01:27:58,192
Not just a few hours.

1308
01:27:58,812 --> 01:28:01,523
I'm talking about blocking out time
for myself for the whole year.

1309
01:28:02,603 --> 01:28:04,353
This isn't working for me anymore.

1310
01:28:08,563 --> 01:28:11,234
Organize your time differently,
it's up to you.

1311
01:28:11,394 --> 01:28:14,064
When's the last time
you helped him do his homework?

1312
01:28:14,274 --> 01:28:17,944
So many things you don't care about.
That's the time I mean.

1313
01:28:19,065 --> 01:28:22,695
Darling, the book just came out.
You know it's just this time.

1314
01:28:22,855 --> 01:28:25,355
It's always "just this time".

1315
01:28:27,486 --> 01:28:30,646
Whether you have a book out,
or you're writing,

1316
01:28:30,816 --> 01:28:33,896
or you need space
to figure out what to write.

1317
01:28:36,237 --> 01:28:38,897
I've been following
your lead for years!

1318
01:28:39,777 --> 01:28:41,857
I can't do anything with my time.

1319
01:28:42,397 --> 01:28:43,468
Do you understand?

1320
01:28:47,358 --> 01:28:49,738
It's not my time, it's yours!

1321
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:57,029
Do I force you to teach?

1322
01:28:58,779 --> 01:29:01,740
Do I force you
to homeschool Daniel?

1323
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:03,990
No one's forcing you.

1324
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,780
If you want more time,
I've never stopped you.

1325
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:08,401
Are you fucking serious?

1326
01:29:09,361 --> 01:29:12,031
I cut my course load in half
to gain more time

1327
01:29:12,201 --> 01:29:13,701
and it's still not enough.

1328
01:29:13,861 --> 01:29:16,702
I have to finish the renovation,
and I'm dealing with everything else!

1329
01:29:19,152 --> 01:29:21,612
Why do you refuse to talk about it?

1330
01:29:21,782 --> 01:29:25,403
Why can't you just admit it has to do
with how things are divided between us?

1331
01:29:25,573 --> 01:29:26,743
Because you're wrong.

1332
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:29,653
I don't owe you any time.
I do my part.

1333
01:29:30,243 --> 01:29:33,243
Come on, let's not
take inventory here, please.

1334
01:29:34,404 --> 01:29:35,614
Let's relax.

1335
01:29:42,405 --> 01:29:43,615
I love you.

1336
01:29:50,406 --> 01:29:53,116
When you decided
to homeschool Daniel,

1337
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:55,006
I told you be careful.

1338
01:29:55,706 --> 01:29:58,326
It's a beautiful, generous choice.
I thank you for it,

1339
01:29:58,496 --> 01:30:01,247
but you don't have to.
I told you it would force you...

1340
01:30:01,407 --> 01:30:04,617
What?
To spend more time with my son?

1341
01:30:06,247 --> 01:30:07,538
I'm glad I did.

1342
01:30:08,748 --> 01:30:11,868
I wouldn't have the relationship
I have with him today if I didn't.

1343
01:30:14,958 --> 01:30:17,959
The relationship
I don't have with him, you mean?

1344
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:20,119
I didn't say that, no.

1345
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:26,080
I'm saying maybe,

1346
01:30:27,910 --> 01:30:31,080
just maybe, things are a little
out of balance between us.

1347
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:33,911
I want you to look at that.
Why is this so hard to discuss?

1348
01:30:34,081 --> 01:30:36,711
I don't believe in the notion
of reciprocity in a couple.

1349
01:30:36,871 --> 01:30:38,661
It's naÃ¯ve and frankly, depressing.

1350
01:30:39,541 --> 01:30:43,212
Yes. And I think
discussing it is a waste of time,

1351
01:30:43,372 --> 01:30:45,622
considering the state
you're in. Seriously.

1352
01:30:46,582 --> 01:30:49,043
All this blah-blah-blah,
and more time is gone.

1353
01:30:50,163 --> 01:30:51,663
All this time spent chitchatting

1354
01:30:51,833 --> 01:30:54,293
could be spent in silence
doing whatever you want to do,

1355
01:30:54,463 --> 01:30:55,833
if only you knew.

1356
01:30:56,043 --> 01:30:58,834
I want time to start writing,
same as you.

1357
01:30:59,584 --> 01:31:00,584
Do it.

1358
01:31:00,664 --> 01:31:04,044
Writers don't stop writing
because they have a son and chores.

1359
01:31:04,214 --> 01:31:06,625
Stop whining about
your scheduling bullshit

1360
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:10,545
and stop blaming me
for what you did or didn't do.

1361
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:13,665
I live with you.
I plan my life around you.

1362
01:31:15,126 --> 01:31:17,966
If I imposed on you
what you're imposing on me,

1363
01:31:18,666 --> 01:31:20,416
neither of us would be able to write.

1364
01:31:20,586 --> 01:31:22,967
Don't worry about me,
I always manage to write.

1365
01:31:23,467 --> 01:31:24,587
Great.

1366
01:31:25,297 --> 01:31:26,297
Perfect.

1367
01:31:26,337 --> 01:31:28,337
If you're so sure of yourself, adapt.

1368
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:30,938
I do adapt.
I take Daniel to school.

1369
01:31:31,258 --> 01:31:33,508
- Once a week.
- We have Monica on Tuesdays, come on.

1370
01:31:33,668 --> 01:31:35,378
Sandra, don't be dishonest.

1371
01:31:35,448 --> 01:31:37,988
- I'm not. You're the one nitpicking.
- I've given you too much.

1372
01:31:38,068 --> 01:31:40,439
Too much time,
too many concessions.

1373
01:31:40,589 --> 01:31:42,299
I want this time back.

1374
01:31:42,469 --> 01:31:44,169
And you owe it to me. Be fair!

1375
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:46,649
I'm sorry, but no.
Are you insane?

1376
01:31:46,799 --> 01:31:48,260
I don't owe you anything.

1377
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:49,720
Really.

1378
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:51,840
This is about your relationship
with your son.

1379
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:53,550
And to protect
yourself and your comfort,

1380
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,301
because you got scared and
put yourself in that position.

1381
01:31:56,511 --> 01:32:00,011
It was your choice to come here
and start this renovation.

1382
01:32:00,171 --> 01:32:02,221
This is your own trap!

1383
01:32:03,091 --> 01:32:06,922
I don't take your time,
you waste it all on your own!

1384
01:32:07,132 --> 01:32:08,922
I want things to change now.

1385
01:32:09,092 --> 01:32:11,302
I want time to start writing again.

1386
01:32:11,472 --> 01:32:12,672
Great, go for it.

1387
01:32:13,383 --> 01:32:16,133
If you want my advice,
go back to the one you ditched.

1388
01:32:17,133 --> 01:32:20,423
That's your advice?
Go back to the book you plundered?

1389
01:32:21,224 --> 01:32:22,924
So now it's plundering.

1390
01:32:23,094 --> 01:32:25,264
We've discussed it.
You'd given up.

1391
01:32:26,694 --> 01:32:30,735
You took the book's best idea.
How am I supposed to go back to it?

1392
01:32:31,095 --> 01:32:33,055
Do you realize
how cynical that is of you?

1393
01:32:33,265 --> 01:32:35,725
Publish your own version,
say it inspired me,

1394
01:32:35,885 --> 01:32:37,055
I'll admit to it.

1395
01:32:37,515 --> 01:32:41,016
If something needs to be written,
someone has to write it. You know.

1396
01:32:41,226 --> 01:32:44,266
You have animal vision.
You pretend to be obliging, but...

1397
01:32:44,496 --> 01:32:48,287
Look at you.
Even your bullshit moralizing...

1398
01:32:48,427 --> 01:32:52,137
And this, really, is a way
for you to waste more time.

1399
01:32:52,307 --> 01:32:54,517
You should be flattered
that I was inspired by you.

1400
01:32:54,677 --> 01:32:56,928
This is life, things circulate.

1401
01:32:57,098 --> 01:32:58,268
Yes.

1402
01:32:59,098 --> 01:33:02,228
And frankly, I wish
you'd be inspired to plunder me.

1403
01:33:02,388 --> 01:33:05,019
You're not alone in your jungle,
but you impose everything.

1404
01:33:05,229 --> 01:33:08,019
You impose your rhythm,
your use of time,

1405
01:33:08,479 --> 01:33:09,519
even your language.

1406
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:12,770
Even with language,
I meet you on your turf.

1407
01:33:12,930 --> 01:33:14,520
We speak English at home.

1408
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,890
I'm not on my turf,
I don't speak my mother tongue.

1409
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:19,350
Nor mine, though we live here.

1410
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,771
Yes, it's a middle ground, in fact.

1411
01:33:22,521 --> 01:33:25,021
Because I'm not French,
you're not German.

1412
01:33:25,181 --> 01:33:28,482
We create a middle ground, so nobody
has to go to the other's turf.

1413
01:33:28,642 --> 01:33:32,482
This is what English is for.
Don't blame me for that.

1414
01:33:32,642 --> 01:33:35,642
But we live in France.
That's our reality.

1415
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:38,763
Daniel hears you speak a language
that has nothing to do wife, his life,

1416
01:33:38,813 --> 01:33:42,103
just because you impose it on him,
like everything else.

1417
01:33:42,273 --> 01:33:44,183
We're on your turf, all the time.

1418
01:33:44,413 --> 01:33:45,954
Your country!

1419
01:33:46,734 --> 01:33:51,314
Every single day I have to accept
that we live in your hometown!

1420
01:33:51,734 --> 01:33:53,935
The people you grew up with
look down on me

1421
01:33:54,105 --> 01:33:57,025
whenever I don't make the effort
to smile at them.

1422
01:33:58,275 --> 01:34:01,816
You don't think me living here
counts as meeting you on your turf?

1423
01:34:02,606 --> 01:34:04,486
You never smile at anyone.

1424
01:34:05,526 --> 01:34:07,356
That's why you love me, right?

1425
01:34:07,526 --> 01:34:10,987
Because, if you wanted a stupid
bitch who grins at your friends,

1426
01:34:11,147 --> 01:34:13,147
you'd have picked someone else.

1427
01:34:18,107 --> 01:34:19,488
You really have no shame.

1428
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:21,108
That's a superpower.

1429
01:34:21,278 --> 01:34:23,068
You see no one but yourself.

1430
01:34:23,238 --> 01:34:26,148
I see you very clearly,
just not as a victim.

1431
01:34:27,069 --> 01:34:28,109
You impose

1432
01:34:28,339 --> 01:34:31,919
your way of living, speaking, eating,

1433
01:34:32,129 --> 01:34:33,049
even fucking.

1434
01:34:33,109 --> 01:34:35,690
I could never get you to fuck
any other way.

1435
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:38,780
Because you expect me to follow your
lead, that's your notion of a couple.

1436
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:40,860
I don't believe it;
I don't believe it...

1437
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:44,901
I don't have a notion, I don't
give a fuck about couples. Really.

1438
01:34:47,941 --> 01:34:50,281
So, you say I'm stopping you

1439
01:34:50,441 --> 01:34:52,612
from fucking the way you want.

1440
01:34:52,992 --> 01:34:54,402
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1441
01:34:54,782 --> 01:34:57,322
Who's been refusing
to fuck since the accident?

1442
01:34:57,492 --> 01:34:58,942
You know I meant before.

1443
01:34:59,112 --> 01:35:02,323
What did I ever
refuse to do sexually?

1444
01:35:05,113 --> 01:35:06,243
Everything.

1445
01:35:07,943 --> 01:35:10,744
Everything plus I have to accept
that you fuck other people.

1446
01:35:10,974 --> 01:35:12,594
I do not fuck other people.

1447
01:35:12,744 --> 01:35:13,744
Don't deny it.

1448
01:35:13,904 --> 01:35:17,245
Once, and you cling to it
in order to suffer!

1449
01:35:17,405 --> 01:35:20,365
- You cheated several times.
- You make yourself the victim!

1450
01:35:20,535 --> 01:35:23,325
I'm not a victim,
I'm a man who's been cheated on!

1451
01:35:23,495 --> 01:35:24,995
Plundered and cheated on.

1452
01:35:29,906 --> 01:35:33,116
I can live without sex,
but not forever.

1453
01:35:34,157 --> 01:35:36,657
So you blame me?
I'm the one frustrating you?

1454
01:35:36,887 --> 01:35:39,087
It's not about who's...

1455
01:35:39,787 --> 01:35:42,247
who's blaming who
or who's frustrating who.

1456
01:35:42,408 --> 01:35:44,908
The frustration is there
and we're both dealing with it.

1457
01:35:45,828 --> 01:35:49,198
Me personally
I refuse to rot inside,

1458
01:35:49,428 --> 01:35:50,468
so I find solutions.

1459
01:35:50,618 --> 01:35:53,699
At this point, sex was a question
of personal hygiene!

1460
01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:57,789
But you impose your solutions,
which are solutions for you only.

1461
01:35:57,949 --> 01:36:00,160
You don't give a shit
if it hurts me and Daniel.

1462
01:36:00,330 --> 01:36:03,160
You leave Daniel out of this.
This is not about him.

1463
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:04,950
I do not impose anything on him.

1464
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,120
You made us live here
among the goats.

1465
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:09,451
You complain
about the life you chose!

1466
01:36:09,621 --> 01:36:11,201
You're not a victim.

1467
01:36:11,541 --> 01:36:13,291
Not at all!

1468
01:36:13,451 --> 01:36:17,162
Your generosity conceals
something dirtier and meaner.

1469
01:36:18,332 --> 01:36:21,252
You're incapable of facing
your ambitions and resent me for it.

1470
01:36:21,412 --> 01:36:25,543
But I didn't put you where you are.
I've nothing to do with it!

1471
01:36:25,953 --> 01:36:28,503
You're not sacrificing yourself,
as you say.

1472
01:36:28,663 --> 01:36:32,043
You choose to sit on the sidelines
because you're afraid!

1473
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:34,084
Your pride makes your head explode

1474
01:36:34,254 --> 01:36:37,294
before you can even come up
with a germ of an idea!

1475
01:36:37,454 --> 01:36:40,084
You wake up at 40
needing someone to blame.

1476
01:36:40,254 --> 01:36:41,705
You're the one to blame!

1477
01:36:44,125 --> 01:36:46,795
You're petrified
by your own fucking standards

1478
01:36:46,955 --> 01:36:48,255
and fear of failure.

1479
01:36:48,415 --> 01:36:49,706
This is the truth.

1480
01:36:49,876 --> 01:36:52,166
You're smart.
I know you know I'm right.

1481
01:36:52,396 --> 01:36:55,476
And Daniel has nothing to do with it.
Stop it!

1482
01:37:00,207 --> 01:37:01,627
You're a monster.

1483
01:37:03,047 --> 01:37:05,167
Even Daniel says it,
with his own words.

1484
01:37:05,337 --> 01:37:07,458
Take that back,
you piece of shit.

1485
01:37:07,628 --> 01:37:10,458
He's told me countless times
how hard you are.

1486
01:37:10,628 --> 01:37:12,668
He's telling you
what you want to hear.

1487
01:37:12,838 --> 01:37:15,799
He can feel your guilt
and he's trying to reassure you,

1488
01:37:16,029 --> 01:37:17,399
don't you see that?

1489
01:37:17,549 --> 01:37:20,049
You've never stopped
feeling guilty about him!

1490
01:37:20,279 --> 01:37:21,529
You're cold-hearted.

1491
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:22,759
You have no pity.

1492
01:37:22,919 --> 01:37:24,590
And you have
way too much for yourself.

1493
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:27,670
I can't stand any more
of your fucking ice!

1494
01:37:30,130 --> 01:37:31,761
- You're violent!
- Yes, I am!

1495
01:38:00,554 --> 01:38:01,804
So...

1496
01:38:02,344 --> 01:38:05,925
Can you tell us
where you found this recording?

1497
01:38:07,845 --> 01:38:10,515
On a USB key belonging to the victim.

1498
01:38:10,675 --> 01:38:14,926
He made several dozen recordings
on his cellphone.

1499
01:38:15,676 --> 01:38:19,556
For 6 months, he'd been recording
moments from, his life.

1500
01:38:19,716 --> 01:38:21,596
For a literary project, apparently.

1501
01:38:21,807 --> 01:38:23,967
Did he transcribe all the recordings?

1502
01:38:24,137 --> 01:38:26,177
Yes, except this last argument.

1503
01:38:26,967 --> 01:38:30,558
Does your investigation link
this argument to his death?

1504
01:38:30,718 --> 01:38:34,348
Yes. They occurred 20 hours apart
and have common themes.

1505
01:38:34,518 --> 01:38:36,388
He criticizes her infidelity.

1506
01:38:36,558 --> 01:38:38,969
A pretty girl comes the next day.

1507
01:38:39,309 --> 01:38:41,719
A literature student,

1508
01:38:41,889 --> 01:38:44,849
to interview Sandra Voyter
about her books.

1509
01:38:45,639 --> 01:38:48,140
There must've been
tension in the air.

1510
01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:49,520
The two women

1511
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:53,810
were enjoying themselves
while he worked hard upstairs.

1512
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:59,021
The argument can be seen as
a dress rehearsal for the next day.

1513
01:38:59,181 --> 01:39:03,561
How do you interpret
the violent outbursts?

1514
01:39:04,022 --> 01:39:05,562
We hear blows.

1515
01:39:06,352 --> 01:39:09,602
A physical altercation,
the accused striking her husband.

1516
01:39:09,772 --> 01:39:13,393
What makes it possible for you
to reach that conclusion?

1517
01:39:14,273 --> 01:39:17,023
She seems to be
in a more intense state of rage.

1518
01:39:20,143 --> 01:39:22,894
- Sorry?
- Speak directly to the court.

1519
01:39:23,064 --> 01:39:26,434
She's clearly
in a more intense state of rage.

1520
01:39:27,934 --> 01:39:32,525
Her shouts at the end of the audio
are the last step

1521
01:39:32,685 --> 01:39:35,105
before the violence gets physical.

1522
01:39:35,525 --> 01:39:39,026
The confusion that follows
is hard to analyze, but...

1523
01:39:39,436 --> 01:39:42,566
we hear blows to a body or a face,

1524
01:39:42,726 --> 01:39:45,396
and the muffled screams we hear

1525
01:39:45,567 --> 01:39:47,227
are Mr. Maleski's.

1526
01:39:47,397 --> 01:39:49,607
You mentioned
bruises on Mrs Voyter.

1527
01:39:49,777 --> 01:39:51,977
Show Exhibit 9, please.

1528
01:39:52,727 --> 01:39:56,068
This photo was taken
on the day her husband died.

1529
01:39:56,398 --> 01:39:57,818
How did she explain it?

1530
01:39:57,978 --> 01:40:01,688
She initially told us
she'd bumped into a kitchen counter.

1531
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:05,399
We pointed out that the bruising
was around her wrist,

1532
01:40:05,609 --> 01:40:08,649
and looked a lot
like signs of a struggle.

1533
01:40:09,359 --> 01:40:11,980
Later, when we played her
the recording,

1534
01:40:12,150 --> 01:40:14,730
she admitted it had happened then,

1535
01:40:15,230 --> 01:40:16,900
during their brief struggle.

1536
01:40:17,070 --> 01:40:18,980
So you admit you lied?

1537
01:40:19,901 --> 01:40:21,031
Yes.

1538
01:40:21,651 --> 01:40:22,901
Because..

1539
01:40:23,231 --> 01:40:27,151
I was afraid
that if I mentioned it,

1540
01:40:28,072 --> 01:40:31,032
I knew it would make me a suspect
and I got scared.

1541
01:40:31,192 --> 01:40:34,112
And you didn't know
he'd recorded the fight.

1542
01:40:34,282 --> 01:40:35,612
So you lied twice.

1543
01:40:35,782 --> 01:40:39,323
About the bruises,
and by not mentioning the fight.

1544
01:40:39,483 --> 01:40:42,153
For me, it was just one lie.

1545
01:40:42,323 --> 01:40:46,484
Because, if I'd been honest about the
bruises, I'd have mentioned the argument.

1546
01:40:46,904 --> 01:40:49,324
I didn't want to be seen as guilty.

1547
01:40:49,534 --> 01:40:51,404
As no guilty person ever does.

1548
01:40:51,574 --> 01:40:53,985
Can we time the bruises exactly?

1549
01:40:54,155 --> 01:40:56,485
The doctor examined her
the following day.

1550
01:40:57,285 --> 01:41:01,536
It was too late to determine exactly
when they occurred.

1551
01:41:01,736 --> 01:41:03,286
So it's possible

1552
01:41:03,446 --> 01:41:07,366
a second fight caused the bruises
on the day Mr. Maleski died.

1553
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:19,738
What do we hear
at the end of the argument?

1554
01:41:20,488 --> 01:41:22,738
The first sound of breaking glass

1555
01:41:22,908 --> 01:41:25,368
is me throwing a glass
against the wall.

1556
01:41:25,538 --> 01:41:28,079
A wine glass that was on the table.

1557
01:41:28,869 --> 01:41:33,329
After that, I went over to my husband
and I slapped him.

1558
01:41:33,949 --> 01:41:37,160
That's when he grabbed my wrist,
quite violently.

1559
01:41:37,330 --> 01:41:39,490
That's the struggling we can hear.

1560
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:44,451
Just after, I tried to stop him from
throwing picture frames to the floor

1561
01:41:44,621 --> 01:41:46,661
but I couldn't,
so we hear them shattering.

1562
01:41:47,371 --> 01:41:49,491
Aside from that slap,
did you hit him?

1563
01:41:50,041 --> 01:41:51,161
No.

1564
01:41:52,492 --> 01:41:53,832
What we hear next

1565
01:41:53,992 --> 01:41:58,372
is Samuel repeatedly hitting himself
in the face and the head,

1566
01:41:59,042 --> 01:42:01,543
and then punching the wall.

1567
01:42:01,703 --> 01:42:03,543
You can still see the dent.

1568
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:08,294
There are a few around the house,
it's not the first time he did that.

1569
01:42:08,834 --> 01:42:12,124
Years ago, he already broke a finger

1570
01:42:12,624 --> 01:42:14,994
punching the wall during an episode.

1571
01:42:17,045 --> 01:42:19,455
We have photos
of those dents in the wall.

1572
01:42:19,625 --> 01:42:20,625
Thank you.

1573
01:42:20,815 --> 01:42:21,565
Here.

1574
01:42:21,705 --> 01:42:23,955
And the X-ray
of his fractured finger,

1575
01:42:24,165 --> 01:42:27,796
taken in June 2017
at the hospital in Grenoble.

1576
01:42:29,026 --> 01:42:30,316
Is it fair to say

1577
01:42:30,456 --> 01:42:35,297
your depiction of the violence
is interpretive and not objective?

1578
01:42:37,087 --> 01:42:39,747
She repeatedly lied to us,
so believing her...

1579
01:42:39,957 --> 01:42:41,798
Thus, this is about believing,

1580
01:42:41,958 --> 01:42:43,338
or not believing.

1581
01:42:43,668 --> 01:42:45,548
It's a subjective opinion,

1582
01:42:45,708 --> 01:42:47,958
based on an ambiguous recording.

1583
01:42:48,918 --> 01:42:51,799
You link the argument
of the day of the death.

1584
01:42:51,959 --> 01:42:54,669
You call it a "dress rehearsal".

1585
01:42:54,839 --> 01:42:56,629
Do you have any direct proof?

1586
01:42:56,799 --> 01:42:59,840
The recording
is direct proof of a fight.

1587
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,800
I mean the day of the death.

1588
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:06,210
With no witnesses or confessions,
we must interpret.

1589
01:43:08,841 --> 01:43:11,961
In fact, this violent fight is...

1590
01:43:12,131 --> 01:43:15,212
phantasmal.
It exists only as fantasy.

1591
01:43:15,842 --> 01:43:17,302
You float the idea,

1592
01:43:17,462 --> 01:43:19,132
the prosecutor floats it,

1593
01:43:19,302 --> 01:43:22,092
over or around the facts,

1594
01:43:22,252 --> 01:43:25,593
making it omnipresent
here in court, but...

1595
01:43:27,423 --> 01:43:30,593
We risk turning this fantasy
into a reality

1596
01:43:30,753 --> 01:43:34,094
simply because
there was indeed a fight

1597
01:43:34,464 --> 01:43:37,174
the day before Mr. Maleski died.

1598
01:43:37,714 --> 01:43:41,595
Don't substitute the day before
for the next day.

1599
01:43:42,805 --> 01:43:46,465
We can't fill the blanks
with a supposition,

1600
01:43:46,635 --> 01:43:50,386
simply because we have sounds
for one and not the other.

1601
01:43:50,556 --> 01:43:51,556
Mrs Voyter,

1602
01:43:51,636 --> 01:43:55,426
did you know he'd recorded
you before you were told?

1603
01:43:57,137 --> 01:44:00,717
No, but I knew that he often recorded
moments of our lives.

1604
01:44:00,927 --> 01:44:03,217
He didn't always let you know?

1605
01:44:03,387 --> 01:44:05,638
What were these recordings?

1606
01:44:06,718 --> 01:44:08,598
At first, he would mention it.

1607
01:44:08,758 --> 01:44:11,428
After a while,
he did it without us knowing.

1608
01:44:11,598 --> 01:44:14,309
He recorded conversations,

1609
01:44:14,469 --> 01:44:16,469
Daniel's piano lessons,

1610
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:20,219
and sometimes just himself,
talking to himself.

1611
01:44:20,389 --> 01:44:24,970
I think he wanted to gather material
to help him start writing again.

1612
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:29,510
Now, with hindsight,
it seems possible

1613
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,971
that he could have provoked
this fight just to record it.

1614
01:44:33,311 --> 01:44:37,511
Wait, are you implying
you're the victim of a twisted man?

1615
01:44:37,681 --> 01:44:38,851
Seriously?

1616
01:44:39,392 --> 01:44:42,812
He recorded her in secret.
It's a valid question.

1617
01:44:42,972 --> 01:44:45,562
You forget the situation is perverse.

1618
01:44:46,392 --> 01:44:47,683
Now the victim is on trial!

1619
01:44:47,853 --> 01:44:49,763
No, but my client has a point.

1620
01:44:49,933 --> 01:44:53,223
Can you explain
what he means by cheating,

1621
01:44:53,393 --> 01:44:54,723
and how he found out?

1622
01:44:57,064 --> 01:45:00,064
He went through my phone
and discovered messages

1623
01:45:00,224 --> 01:45:02,934
from a woman I'd met
at the beginning of that year.

1624
01:45:03,104 --> 01:45:05,315
What do you mean by "met"?

1625
01:45:05,725 --> 01:45:08,065
It was sexual,
we slept together twice.

1626
01:45:08,225 --> 01:45:09,225
Twice?

1627
01:45:09,265 --> 01:45:10,265
Yes.

1628
01:45:10,435 --> 01:45:13,066
On the recording you said once.

1629
01:45:13,976 --> 01:45:16,316
It meant with just one person.

1630
01:45:17,016 --> 01:45:18,316
Hang on...

1631
01:45:18,816 --> 01:45:22,317
Samuel mentions
numerous affairs in the past.

1632
01:45:22,477 --> 01:45:25,147
It sounds like
you cheated constantly.

1633
01:45:25,357 --> 01:45:26,977
That's not true.

1634
01:45:27,517 --> 01:45:31,068
I had a few flings
the year of Daniel's accident.

1635
01:45:31,228 --> 01:45:33,478
It wasn't cheating,
because Samuel knew.

1636
01:45:33,648 --> 01:45:35,188
He found out each time?

1637
01:45:35,518 --> 01:45:37,068
No, I told him.

1638
01:45:37,729 --> 01:45:39,319
It was a tricky year.

1639
01:45:39,479 --> 01:45:41,729
You want us to believe
he agreed to it?

1640
01:45:42,359 --> 01:45:46,320
I'm not saying that,
I'm saying I was honest about it.

1641
01:45:47,070 --> 01:45:48,770
Interesting take on honesty.

1642
01:45:48,940 --> 01:45:52,230
But the year he died
you quit being honest, why?

1643
01:45:55,401 --> 01:45:56,901
Things were different.

1644
01:45:57,071 --> 01:46:00,521
I felt that it would hurt him
too much at that time.

1645
01:46:00,691 --> 01:46:03,612
Because you had feelings
for that woman?

1646
01:46:03,772 --> 01:46:06,612
No, I felt it would hurt him
because he was fragile.

1647
01:46:06,772 --> 01:46:08,272
And...

1648
01:46:08,442 --> 01:46:11,403
As I said,
with her it was just sexual.

1649
01:46:11,573 --> 01:46:14,363
The person I had feelings for
was Samuel.

1650
01:46:14,523 --> 01:46:16,403
Interesting take on feelings.

1651
01:46:16,573 --> 01:46:17,903
I'm trying to understand.

1652
01:46:18,073 --> 01:46:21,274
At first you agreed
on an open relationship,

1653
01:46:21,444 --> 01:46:23,154
then that changed?

1654
01:46:24,324 --> 01:46:27,234
I don't even know
what that means, I'm sorry.

1655
01:46:27,404 --> 01:46:30,865
Sorry. No, we never had
that kind of agreement.

1656
01:46:31,025 --> 01:46:35,365
After the accident,
we were both trying to feel better.

1657
01:46:35,525 --> 01:46:37,696
I needed that to keep it together,

1658
01:46:37,906 --> 01:46:39,076
and I was honest.

1659
01:46:39,236 --> 01:46:42,576
But then you quit being honest,
and he held you accountable.

1660
01:46:42,736 --> 01:46:45,157
He doesn't sound "fragile".

1661
01:46:45,327 --> 01:46:47,697
- Do you admit he was jealous?
- Yes.

1662
01:46:47,867 --> 01:46:49,777
OK. Had he become obsessed?

1663
01:46:49,987 --> 01:46:51,657
No. I don't know...

1664
01:46:52,077 --> 01:46:54,198
He was hurt, that's true.

1665
01:46:55,618 --> 01:46:57,868
Sometimes when we fought
he brought it up.

1666
01:46:58,028 --> 01:47:00,528
But he didn't think about it
all the time.

1667
01:47:01,028 --> 01:47:05,079
According to your logic,
all Samuel's problems were my fault.

1668
01:47:05,239 --> 01:47:08,079
That's not true.
His pain came from a deeper place.

1669
01:47:08,279 --> 01:47:12,490
According to "his" logic
you're to blame, as we heard.

1670
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:16,030
What does he mean when he says
his work was plundered?

1671
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:19,331
No, there wasn't any plundering.

1672
01:47:19,491 --> 01:47:23,701
In the book that he abandoned,
there was an interesting passage...

1673
01:47:23,871 --> 01:47:25,661
A passage?
How many pages?

1674
01:47:25,991 --> 01:47:27,032
About 20.

1675
01:47:27,242 --> 01:47:28,372
27.

1676
01:47:29,162 --> 01:47:32,532
It was just a rough outline.
I thought the idea was brilliant.

1677
01:47:32,702 --> 01:47:33,832
Can you summarize it?

1678
01:47:33,992 --> 01:47:36,583
Must we enter into a literary debate?

1679
01:47:36,743 --> 01:47:38,743
This isn't literary, it's concrete.

1680
01:47:38,953 --> 01:47:40,703
It's the heart of their conflict.

1681
01:47:41,033 --> 01:47:44,284
I don't know how else
to present it to the jurors.

1682
01:47:44,454 --> 01:47:45,454
Nor do I.

1683
01:47:45,584 --> 01:47:46,624
Proceed.

1684
01:47:46,784 --> 01:47:47,954
Well...

1685
01:47:48,124 --> 01:47:51,124
It was about a guy imagining
how his life would've been

1686
01:47:51,284 --> 01:47:53,665
without the accident
that killed his brother.

1687
01:47:53,995 --> 01:47:56,835
He wakes up and finds himself
in two different realities.

1688
01:47:56,995 --> 01:47:58,995
In one, the accident
is the center of his life.

1689
01:47:59,165 --> 01:48:01,206
In the other, it never happened.

1690
01:48:01,376 --> 01:48:03,836
I told Samuel I loved it.

1691
01:48:03,996 --> 01:48:07,126
He had me read
everything he wrote back then.

1692
01:48:07,456 --> 01:48:10,707
Soon after,
he abandoned the whole book.

1693
01:48:10,877 --> 01:48:13,627
I asked him if I could use the idea
and he said yes.

1694
01:48:13,837 --> 01:48:14,877
No.

1695
01:48:15,537 --> 01:48:18,208
He couldn't have,
he calls it plundering.

1696
01:48:18,378 --> 01:48:20,208
It's an argument.

1697
01:48:20,378 --> 01:48:23,628
People exaggerate and alter facts
when they argue.

1698
01:48:23,788 --> 01:48:26,589
It's no exaggeration to say his
book became yours: "ECLIPSE".

1699
01:48:30,919 --> 01:48:34,630
All I took was this idea.

1700
01:48:34,790 --> 01:48:37,380
My characters are a woman
and her daughter,

1701
01:48:37,540 --> 01:48:38,710
and I developed the story

1702
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:40,750
over 300 pages.

1703
01:48:42,881 --> 01:48:47,131
I can't believe I must tell you what's the
difference between an outline and a novel?

1704
01:48:47,291 --> 01:48:48,631
He agreed to it.

1705
01:48:48,791 --> 01:48:53,002
And when he read it, he said
I did something very different.

1706
01:48:53,172 --> 01:48:56,922
Sometimes yes, when we argued
it came out, because...

1707
01:48:57,092 --> 01:48:59,843
he was upset
because he couldn't write.

1708
01:49:00,043 --> 01:49:03,793
The only thing we know for sure
is that "it came out".

1709
01:49:03,963 --> 01:49:05,673
Did the two of you...

1710
01:49:06,253 --> 01:49:09,214
argue again
before the time of his death?

1711
01:49:09,384 --> 01:49:11,464
It must've been very tense.

1712
01:49:14,174 --> 01:49:15,254
We were...

1713
01:49:16,505 --> 01:49:18,255
we were both really shaken.

1714
01:49:18,425 --> 01:49:21,845
We were both keeping to ourselves
and Samuel was...

1715
01:49:23,095 --> 01:49:24,636
I don't know, something was gone.

1716
01:49:24,796 --> 01:49:27,596
He was depleted,
his energy was just gone.

1717
01:49:27,756 --> 01:49:31,176
In the audio, I hear Samuel Maleski
arguing strenuously.

1718
01:49:31,346 --> 01:49:34,637
I hear a man determined
to regain control of his life.

1719
01:49:34,797 --> 01:49:37,757
In no way
a man who has decided to give up.

1720
01:49:37,927 --> 01:49:42,468
Samuel's psychiatrist said he was
combative in their last sessions.

1721
01:49:42,638 --> 01:49:47,258
Do you kill yourself after fighting
for time and self-esteem?

1722
01:49:47,428 --> 01:49:51,969
Do you kill yourself after pleading
so fiercely and energetically

1723
01:49:52,139 --> 01:49:55,639
for balance and justice
in your relationship? No.

1724
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:59,430
That's the main flaw
in the suicide theory.

1725
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:02,800
You say he seemed "depleted".

1726
01:50:02,970 --> 01:50:04,550
His energy was gone.

1727
01:50:04,890 --> 01:50:08,891
May I read from one of Mrs Voyter's
recent books, "The Black House"?

1728
01:50:09,051 --> 01:50:10,891
We judge facts, not books.

1729
01:50:11,051 --> 01:50:13,761
Judge, this is a slippery slope.

1730
01:50:13,931 --> 01:50:17,352
In 2017, Sandra Voyter herself
declared, and I quote,

1731
01:50:17,512 --> 01:50:20,552
"My books are linked to my life
and those in it."

1732
01:50:20,762 --> 01:50:23,683
Objection! She's always said
her work is fiction.

1733
01:50:24,303 --> 01:50:26,763
First book is her mother's death!

1734
01:50:26,933 --> 01:50:28,683
Second, a rift with her father.

1735
01:50:28,853 --> 01:50:31,053
Third, her son's accident, etc.

1736
01:50:31,224 --> 01:50:33,304
Her books are part of this trial.

1737
01:50:33,474 --> 01:50:36,354
Her life is in them,
her relationship in particular.

1738
01:50:36,514 --> 01:50:38,354
Go ahead, but keep it brief.

1739
01:50:39,014 --> 01:50:42,145
This is a wife
talking about her husband.

1740
01:50:44,975 --> 01:50:47,936
"He'd stopped complaining.
He'd given up."

1741
01:50:48,436 --> 01:50:51,726
"She studied him,
repulsed by his resignation."

1742
01:50:52,436 --> 01:50:55,646
"An idea sprouted in her mind,
a seed of deliverance."

1743
01:50:55,976 --> 01:50:57,397
"The possibility of his death."

1744
01:50:57,557 --> 01:50:58,647
Give us the context.

1745
01:50:58,807 --> 01:51:00,647
Later: "How does one kill?"

1746
01:51:00,807 --> 01:51:03,607
"What about the body? Its weight?

1747
01:51:03,767 --> 01:51:06,058
"She could think of nothing else.

1748
01:51:06,478 --> 01:51:10,228
"She saw him dead,
his body a lump no longer desired.

1749
01:51:10,398 --> 01:51:12,228
"The body she'd loved

1750
01:51:12,398 --> 01:51:14,609
was now in the way
and had to go."

1751
01:51:14,769 --> 01:51:16,479
I'll provide the context.

1752
01:51:16,689 --> 01:51:20,149
This is a minor character,
going insane,

1753
01:51:20,309 --> 01:51:22,310
who doesn't act on her thoughts.

1754
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:24,900
A novel is not life!
An author is not her characters.

1755
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:28,360
But an author can express herself
through her characters.

1756
01:51:28,520 --> 01:51:29,981
You flagged this passage.

1757
01:51:30,151 --> 01:51:31,941
How can we not see a link?

1758
01:51:32,151 --> 01:51:34,151
Is Stephen King a serial killer?

1759
01:51:34,311 --> 01:51:37,311
Did his wife turn up dead
in suspicious circumstances?

1760
01:51:37,481 --> 01:51:38,562
Focus on the facts!

1761
01:51:38,772 --> 01:51:42,152
Mr. Renzi,
I strongly advise you to calm down.

1762
01:51:42,312 --> 01:51:45,562
Prosecutor, I advise you
to follow Mr. Renzi's advice.

1763
01:51:46,232 --> 01:51:48,403
Focus on the facts.

1764
01:51:51,653 --> 01:51:53,233
Aside from the slap

1765
01:51:53,443 --> 01:51:56,194
you admitted to,
did you ever hit your husband?

1766
01:51:56,654 --> 01:51:57,734
Never?

1767
01:51:58,364 --> 01:51:59,614
That was the only time?

1768
01:51:59,814 --> 01:52:03,194
You were always a good,
admirable soul,

1769
01:52:03,655 --> 01:52:05,445
altruistic, reasonable,

1770
01:52:05,615 --> 01:52:07,735
trying to save him from himself,

1771
01:52:07,905 --> 01:52:10,445
except on this recording?
Rotten luck!

1772
01:52:12,026 --> 01:52:14,026
Any more questions
for the witness?

1773
01:52:14,196 --> 01:52:16,316
I have one more, if I may.

1774
01:52:17,616 --> 01:52:20,116
I'd like to know if Maleski

1775
01:52:20,317 --> 01:52:22,407
sent the transcripts to anyone?

1776
01:52:22,567 --> 01:52:25,117
He sent them to a publisher friend,
Paul Nachez,

1777
01:52:25,277 --> 01:52:27,237
slated to publish his first novel.

1778
01:52:27,407 --> 01:52:29,068
Email from August 9, 2017:

1779
01:52:29,238 --> 01:52:32,778
"I'm writing again, I need your eye.
Still rough, eager to talk."

1780
01:52:32,948 --> 01:52:34,118
Nachez's response:

1781
01:52:34,318 --> 01:52:36,658
"Sure, send it and I'll read it."

1782
01:52:36,818 --> 01:52:39,779
Up to his death,
Maleski sent 4 texts a week.

1783
01:52:39,949 --> 01:52:41,779
What was their communication like?

1784
01:52:41,949 --> 01:52:44,119
The publisher never replied.

1785
01:52:44,449 --> 01:52:47,160
Apparently he was busy
and the project mystified him.

1786
01:52:47,870 --> 01:52:49,450
His friend's silence

1787
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:53,871
must've hurt Mr. Maleski's
already low self-esteem.

1788
01:52:54,031 --> 01:52:55,571
He feels rejected.

1789
01:52:56,071 --> 01:52:58,821
When we read all the writing he sent,

1790
01:52:58,991 --> 01:53:01,281
it's difficult
to identify a storyline.

1791
01:53:01,451 --> 01:53:03,032
At best, it's a project.

1792
01:53:03,202 --> 01:53:04,702
Maleski is a "project man".

1793
01:53:04,872 --> 01:53:07,372
His first abandoned novel,
the chalet...

1794
01:53:08,072 --> 01:53:12,033
So, since we're being asked
to mix justice and literature,

1795
01:53:12,203 --> 01:53:14,073
to imagine what we don't know,

1796
01:53:14,243 --> 01:53:18,033
let's imagine
Samuel Maleski's final year.

1797
01:53:18,203 --> 01:53:19,954
And I'm dabbling in fantasy?

1798
01:53:20,164 --> 01:53:24,074
Give me half the time
you took to read a book!

1799
01:53:24,244 --> 01:53:25,624
Get to the point.

1800
01:53:26,204 --> 01:53:28,415
What was
Samuel Maleski's final year like?

1801
01:53:29,825 --> 01:53:33,995
After accumulating debt
from medical procedures in London,

1802
01:53:34,165 --> 01:53:37,206
he insists on returning
to his hometown.

1803
01:53:37,376 --> 01:53:40,956
He finds a chalet to fix up and rent.
They'll pay off their debts.

1804
01:53:41,126 --> 01:53:44,077
He'll quit teaching
and start writing full-time.

1805
01:53:44,497 --> 01:53:48,207
Renovation proves tricky.
They have to take out a loan.

1806
01:53:48,997 --> 01:53:50,997
A vicious circle begins.

1807
01:53:51,167 --> 01:53:55,168
Samuel needs his teaching wages.
Renovations drag on.

1808
01:53:55,328 --> 01:53:57,498
A year and a half later,

1809
01:53:57,668 --> 01:53:59,038
he feels trapped.

1810
01:53:59,378 --> 01:54:00,919
He's a wounded man.

1811
01:54:01,129 --> 01:54:02,919
His son's accident,
his abandoned novel,

1812
01:54:03,079 --> 01:54:05,459
his wife publishing book after book.

1813
01:54:06,209 --> 01:54:07,629
He must write!

1814
01:54:09,960 --> 01:54:13,290
He quits the antidepressants
and starts recording his life,

1815
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:16,040
embarking on a kind of auto-fiction,

1816
01:54:16,210 --> 01:54:19,251
perhaps inspired by Sandra's method.

1817
01:54:19,421 --> 01:54:22,331
And why not?
She borrows from their lives.

1818
01:54:22,501 --> 01:54:24,421
She did borrow his idea.

1819
01:54:24,631 --> 01:54:25,922
Save it for your plea.

1820
01:54:26,082 --> 01:54:30,002
He's running.
But refuses to see that transcribing

1821
01:54:30,212 --> 01:54:31,292
is not writing.

1822
01:54:31,462 --> 01:54:34,132
His publisher friend's silence
humiliates him.

1823
01:54:35,333 --> 01:54:38,293
What do we hear
in the March 4th fight?

1824
01:54:38,633 --> 01:54:41,583
The energy, the willfulness...
What is it?

1825
01:54:41,963 --> 01:54:43,544
The energy of despair.

1826
01:54:43,714 --> 01:54:46,544
The final push before giving up.

1827
01:54:49,834 --> 01:54:54,085
In his final days, this man
isn't facing a war in his marriage.

1828
01:54:55,295 --> 01:54:57,385
He's facing his own failures.

1829
01:54:59,085 --> 01:55:01,216
Sandra Voyter is only guilty

1830
01:55:01,386 --> 01:55:04,046
of succeeding
where her husband failed.

1831
01:55:08,087 --> 01:55:12,507
Despite appearances, those were not
Mr. Renzi's closing arguments.

1832
01:55:14,257 --> 01:55:16,007
That wasn't Samuel.

1833
01:55:16,177 --> 01:55:19,298
It's Friday evening,
we have a weekend ahead of us.

1834
01:55:19,968 --> 01:55:22,508
Before I adjourn,
I have an announcement.

1835
01:55:22,678 --> 01:55:26,009
I've decided to call Daniel
back to the bar on Monday.

1836
01:55:26,429 --> 01:55:28,679
He has new information of interest.

1837
01:55:28,889 --> 01:55:32,429
Since the witness
is the defendant's son

1838
01:55:32,889 --> 01:55:34,800
and lives with his mother,

1839
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:38,470
I'm asking everyone
to refrain from contacting him.

1840
01:55:38,930 --> 01:55:42,341
Obviously, if contact is inevitable,

1841
01:55:42,511 --> 01:55:45,431
refrain from discussing the trial.

1842
01:55:45,591 --> 01:55:46,841
Mrs Berger,

1843
01:55:47,011 --> 01:55:50,092
you'll stay with Daniel all weekend.

1844
01:55:51,092 --> 01:55:54,472
See to it these rules are respected.

1845
01:55:54,682 --> 01:55:56,552
I insist that no one,

1846
01:55:56,722 --> 01:56:01,013
absolutely no one,
can ask him about his testimony.

1847
01:56:01,893 --> 01:56:04,093
Have a good weekend,
get some rest.

1848
01:56:04,263 --> 01:56:05,973
Court is adjourned.

1849
01:56:54,019 --> 01:56:56,229
- Come get warm.
- Ready in 10!

1850
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:03,650
You OK?

1851
01:57:10,981 --> 01:57:13,061
I think I want to be alone.

1852
01:57:14,522 --> 01:57:15,732
OK.

1853
01:57:17,402 --> 01:57:19,692
- You can eat in your room.
- No.

1854
01:57:19,852 --> 01:57:21,732
I want to be alone this weekend.

1855
01:57:22,233 --> 01:57:23,353
Before I testify.

1856
01:57:23,523 --> 01:57:24,523
Alone?

1857
01:57:24,603 --> 01:57:26,233
Just you and me?

1858
01:57:27,233 --> 01:57:28,233
Is that it?

1859
01:57:29,853 --> 01:57:31,484
Are you sure?

1860
01:57:32,694 --> 01:57:35,944
We can find other solutions.
It's a big house.

1861
01:57:36,564 --> 01:57:38,104
I want her to leave.

1862
01:57:49,026 --> 01:57:50,606
I just spoke to Daniel.

1863
01:57:51,656 --> 01:57:54,316
He wants to be alone this weekend.

1864
01:57:54,486 --> 01:57:56,197
Until the end of the trial.

1865
01:58:10,658 --> 01:58:12,909
Is that what you want?

1866
01:58:17,859 --> 01:58:20,359
OK. Is it because
of what you heard today?

1867
01:58:20,529 --> 01:58:23,780
I couldn't talk to you
about all that before.

1868
01:58:23,950 --> 01:58:26,240
We weren't allowed to..

1869
01:58:27,490 --> 01:58:28,610
No trial talk.

1870
01:58:28,780 --> 01:58:31,491
I know, I'm just talking to my son.

1871
01:58:31,951 --> 01:58:33,031
OK.

1872
01:58:34,321 --> 01:58:36,861
I totally understand
that you need calm.

1873
01:58:37,031 --> 01:58:39,452
I can mind my own business,
keep to myself.

1874
01:58:39,612 --> 01:58:42,862
I won't talk to you
if you don't want. Can we try that?

1875
01:58:43,072 --> 01:58:44,282
No speaking English.

1876
01:58:45,322 --> 01:58:47,413
You can talk to me.

1877
01:58:48,453 --> 01:58:52,613
Couldn't you and I discuss this,
and then you decide?

1878
01:58:54,784 --> 01:58:56,824
I think he's made his decision.

1879
01:59:07,785 --> 01:59:09,995
Yeah, I'll just get my stuff.

1880
01:59:36,369 --> 01:59:37,959
Somebody said,

1881
01:59:38,789 --> 01:59:41,169
of course money
doesn't make you happy,

1882
01:59:41,499 --> 01:59:45,540
but it's still better to cry in a car
than in a subway.

1883
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:50,000
Who said that?

1884
01:59:50,170 --> 01:59:51,500
I don't know.

1885
02:00:52,718 --> 02:00:54,008
Sorry.

1886
02:01:19,551 --> 02:01:20,631
Go on.

1887
02:01:27,472 --> 02:01:28,762
Eat up.

1888
02:01:57,975 --> 02:01:59,096
Snoop...

1889
02:02:11,347 --> 02:02:12,517
Marge!

1890
02:02:14,937 --> 02:02:17,228
Marge, come quick, please!

1891
02:02:23,808 --> 02:02:24,809
What is it?

1892
02:02:27,689 --> 02:02:30,189
I gave him aspirin,
I messed up bad.

1893
02:02:31,269 --> 02:02:33,310
- You gave him aspirin?
- Yes!

1894
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:34,600
How much?

1895
02:02:35,190 --> 02:02:37,560
8 or 10, I can't remember.

1896
02:02:37,730 --> 02:02:38,730
A lot.

1897
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:40,981
Make him vomit.

1898
02:02:41,141 --> 02:02:42,311
Why'd you do that?

1899
02:02:43,101 --> 02:02:44,881
Make him vomit! Please!

1900
02:02:44,991 --> 02:02:46,031
OK, hang on.

1901
02:02:48,271 --> 02:02:49,392
"Make a dog vomit."

1902
02:02:50,142 --> 02:02:51,352
Hang on.

1903
02:02:51,522 --> 02:02:54,192
We need saltwater.
Be right back.

1904
02:03:04,353 --> 02:03:05,443
He's not moving.

1905
02:03:05,643 --> 02:03:07,234
Daniel, help me.

1906
02:03:08,484 --> 02:03:09,854
Open his mouth.

1907
02:03:10,734 --> 02:03:11,774
Easy.

1908
02:03:21,315 --> 02:03:22,856
That's right.

1909
02:03:28,356 --> 02:03:29,566
That's good.

1910
02:03:32,237 --> 02:03:33,987
He's coming around.

1911
02:03:36,527 --> 02:03:39,067
- What's happening?
- He's going to vomit.

1912
02:03:44,948 --> 02:03:45,948
That's it.

1913
02:03:46,068 --> 02:03:47,398
He'll be OK.

1914
02:03:51,199 --> 02:03:52,569
Good dog.

1915
02:04:00,700 --> 02:04:03,490
He's OK, he's breathing.
Looking at us.

1916
02:04:08,901 --> 02:04:10,151
Can you explain?

1917
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:15,362
You know, I...

1918
02:04:16,032 --> 02:04:18,072
I'd never heard about...

1919
02:04:19,532 --> 02:04:21,703
my dad's suicide attempt.

1920
02:04:22,843 --> 02:04:25,173
I'd never heard about...

1921
02:04:25,903 --> 02:04:28,653
the shrink, the medicine...

1922
02:04:29,573 --> 02:04:30,884
the vomit and aspirin.

1923
02:04:31,954 --> 02:04:34,654
When my mom talked about it,
I remembered something

1924
02:04:34,824 --> 02:04:36,404
from around that time.

1925
02:04:37,494 --> 02:04:38,615
One morning,

1926
02:04:38,845 --> 02:04:41,095
Snoop was lying on my bedroom floor.

1927
02:04:41,245 --> 02:04:43,405
Not moving.
He smelled like vomit.

1928
02:04:45,405 --> 02:04:47,456
I figured he'd vomited.

1929
02:04:48,906 --> 02:04:50,746
I cleaned his muzzle.

1930
02:04:51,786 --> 02:04:53,956
I figured he'd...

1931
02:04:54,456 --> 02:04:58,207
I don't know, caught a virus
or something, because...

1932
02:04:58,997 --> 02:05:01,617
he acted strange for days.

1933
02:05:01,787 --> 02:05:03,708
He just slept or drank.

1934
02:05:04,868 --> 02:05:09,118
See? Now I'm thinking
maybe he ate my dad's vomit,

1935
02:05:09,288 --> 02:05:10,788
and "that" made him sick,

1936
02:05:10,958 --> 02:05:12,999
and Mom told the truth!

1937
02:05:14,539 --> 02:05:17,369
So my experiment with the aspirin

1938
02:05:17,539 --> 02:05:19,499
was to see how he'd react.

1939
02:05:19,659 --> 02:05:20,750
And you saw.

1940
02:05:20,910 --> 02:05:24,540
He slept for 14 hours.
Now he's drinking all the time.

1941
02:05:24,710 --> 02:05:26,710
He smells exactly the same!

1942
02:05:27,330 --> 02:05:28,331
Everything!

1943
02:05:28,391 --> 02:05:30,431
Everything's exactly the same!

1944
02:05:32,001 --> 02:05:33,501
But since..

1945
02:05:34,141 --> 02:05:37,552
Since yesterday,
I'm not sure if I believe her or not.

1946
02:05:37,712 --> 02:05:39,582
I knew they fought, but...

1947
02:05:44,082 --> 02:05:45,623
It wasn't...

1948
02:05:46,753 --> 02:05:49,373
I didn't think it was that violent.

1949
02:05:51,373 --> 02:05:53,754
Your memories are all you're sure of,

1950
02:05:53,914 --> 02:05:55,914
and it's important to tell the jury.

1951
02:05:56,084 --> 02:05:57,874
But you're just a witness.

1952
02:05:58,044 --> 02:06:00,374
Do you think she could've killed him?

1953
02:06:03,875 --> 02:06:05,255
It's not for me to judge.

1954
02:06:05,415 --> 02:06:08,335
I know,
but you could at least tell me!

1955
02:06:08,565 --> 02:06:11,816
I can't answer that.
My role is to protect you...

1956
02:06:12,026 --> 02:06:13,816
Fucking help me!

1957
02:06:51,090 --> 02:06:52,301
Actually,

1958
02:06:52,471 --> 02:06:54,631
when we lack an element

1959
02:06:54,861 --> 02:06:57,311
to judge something,
and the lack is unbearable,

1960
02:06:58,471 --> 02:07:00,552
all we can do is decide.

1961
02:07:02,052 --> 02:07:03,222
You see?

1962
02:07:03,882 --> 02:07:06,722
To overcome doubt,
sometimes we have to...

1963
02:07:06,882 --> 02:07:09,553
decide to sway
one way rather than the other.

1964
02:07:11,513 --> 02:07:15,423
Since you need to believe one thing
but have two choices,

1965
02:07:15,593 --> 02:07:17,093
you must choose.

1966
02:07:18,174 --> 02:07:20,384
So you have to invent your belief?

1967
02:07:20,724 --> 02:07:22,764
Yes, well... in a sense.

1968
02:07:23,134 --> 02:07:25,805
So that means, I'm not sure...

1969
02:07:26,725 --> 02:07:30,345
and you're saying
I have to pretend I'm sure?

1970
02:07:31,135 --> 02:07:33,135
No, I'm saying decide.

1971
02:07:34,806 --> 02:07:36,386
That's different.

1972
02:08:08,020 --> 02:08:11,640
What strikes me is
we don't know who's more lyrical.

1973
02:08:11,850 --> 02:08:14,680
- The author or the character?
- Both, no doubt!

1974
02:08:14,850 --> 02:08:16,641
Voyter plays with confusion.

1975
02:08:16,811 --> 02:08:18,641
Her second book goes further,

1976
02:08:18,851 --> 02:08:22,021
telling how her father
couldn't stand the first.

1977
02:08:22,181 --> 02:08:23,311
Undoubtedly true.

1978
02:08:23,481 --> 02:08:27,232
The rift degenerates,
forcing her to leave her country.

1979
02:08:27,432 --> 02:08:31,522
Fearing her father's rage,
she falls prey to horrifying visions.

1980
02:08:31,682 --> 02:08:35,933
I found this troubling quote
in an interview. She says,

1981
02:08:36,273 --> 02:08:38,233
"My job is to cover the tracks,"

1982
02:08:38,393 --> 02:08:41,144
"so fiction can destroy reality."

1983
02:08:42,734 --> 02:08:44,564
Yes, and what excites people

1984
02:08:44,734 --> 02:08:46,814
about the Samuel Maleski case,

1985
02:08:46,984 --> 02:08:49,855
is that it seems to come
from one of her books.

1986
02:08:50,025 --> 02:08:52,485
It feels like
she's already written it.

1987
02:08:52,645 --> 02:08:56,315
Even the doubts around his death,
the way he died,

1988
02:08:56,485 --> 02:08:59,816
Voyter's murky personality,
the amoral, deceptive traits

1989
02:08:59,986 --> 02:09:01,356
she seems to overplay...

1990
02:09:01,526 --> 02:09:03,936
It all reads like her books.

1991
02:09:04,146 --> 02:09:06,567
I don't think it matters how he died.

1992
02:09:06,737 --> 02:09:10,317
The fact is, the idea of a writer
killing her husband

1993
02:09:10,487 --> 02:09:14,147
is far more compelling
than a teacher killing himself.

1994
02:11:24,873 --> 02:11:27,583
If I imagine my mother doing it,
I don't understand.

1995
02:11:29,954 --> 02:11:31,874
But if I imagine my father...

1996
02:11:34,124 --> 02:11:36,334
I think I can understand.

1997
02:11:42,545 --> 02:11:44,705
Prosecutor, any questions?

1998
02:11:47,666 --> 02:11:50,376
The experiment on his dog
proves nothing.

1999
02:11:50,546 --> 02:11:52,336
It's not documented.

2000
02:11:52,506 --> 02:11:55,417
More problematic
are these providential memories,

2001
02:11:55,587 --> 02:11:58,957
clearly jarred
by what he heard during the trial.

2002
02:11:59,587 --> 02:12:02,708
No event can be placed
convincingly on our timeline.

2003
02:12:02,878 --> 02:12:05,458
The time frame of 6 months
before Maleski's death

2004
02:12:05,628 --> 02:12:07,438
comes only from testimony

2005
02:12:07,588 --> 02:12:09,758
given by the defendant herself.

2006
02:12:13,509 --> 02:12:14,919
I'd like to know...

2007
02:12:21,590 --> 02:12:22,960
Did you ever wonder

2008
02:12:23,170 --> 02:12:26,130
if the overdose
your father supposedly took

2009
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:29,711
might've resulted
not from a suicide attempt,

2010
02:12:29,881 --> 02:12:32,711
but from an attempt by your mother
to poison him?

2011
02:12:32,881 --> 02:12:35,591
I'm not accusing,
just making a point.

2012
02:12:35,761 --> 02:12:38,172
So, taking these speculations,

2013
02:12:38,342 --> 02:12:40,922
why choose one over the other?

2014
02:12:41,092 --> 02:12:45,173
Your memories speak
to the consequences, not the causes.

2015
02:12:46,383 --> 02:12:48,763
Yes, I thought about that, but...

2016
02:12:49,673 --> 02:12:52,093
I don't see
why she would've done it.

2017
02:12:52,633 --> 02:12:55,054
It feels like when we lack proof

2018
02:12:55,214 --> 02:12:57,884
to make us sure
how something happened,

2019
02:12:58,424 --> 02:13:01,345
we have to look further,
as the trial is doing.

2020
02:13:01,865 --> 02:13:05,405
When we've looked everywhere
and still don't understand

2021
02:13:05,615 --> 02:13:08,065
how the thing happened,

2022
02:13:08,215 --> 02:13:11,096
I think we have to ask
why it happened.

2023
02:13:16,096 --> 02:13:17,386
Thank you, Daniel.

2024
02:13:18,217 --> 02:13:19,387
Are you finished?

2025
02:13:27,768 --> 02:13:28,968
No.

2026
02:13:30,638 --> 02:13:32,388
I want to say something else.

2027
02:13:39,469 --> 02:13:43,890
Since my dog was sick for days,
Dad and I went to the vet.

2028
02:13:45,350 --> 02:13:47,470
Dad was really quiet in the car.

2029
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:50,930
He didn't even play music.
He usually always does.

2030
02:13:53,521 --> 02:13:56,471
After a while,
he started talking about Snoop.

2031
02:13:58,061 --> 02:13:58,851
He said,

2032
02:13:59,031 --> 02:14:01,032
"You know, he could get sick."

2033
02:14:01,682 --> 02:14:04,932
"Even die. You know that.
You need to be ready."

2034
02:14:06,522 --> 02:14:08,143
I didn't want to hear that.

2035
02:14:08,893 --> 02:14:12,103
Snoop was doing better.
He was still young.

2036
02:14:12,333 --> 02:14:13,493
He'd never been sick.

2037
02:14:13,643 --> 02:14:15,893
I told him he wasn't going to die.

2038
02:14:17,994 --> 02:14:19,364
But he kept going.

2039
02:14:19,894 --> 02:14:24,144
He said, "You need to be aware of it.
It'll happen someday."

2040
02:14:25,105 --> 02:14:28,105
"And it's no wonder Snoop gets tired."

2041
02:14:28,275 --> 02:14:30,275
"He's not so young in dog years."

2042
02:14:33,476 --> 02:14:35,186
"Can you imagine his life?"

2043
02:14:37,356 --> 02:14:39,066
"He's not just any dog."

2044
02:14:40,026 --> 02:14:41,606
"He's a great dog."

2045
02:14:43,147 --> 02:14:45,027
"An outstanding dog."

2046
02:14:46,027 --> 02:14:48,977
"Think about it.
He anticipates your needs,"

2047
02:14:49,397 --> 02:14:51,608
"foresees your movements,"

2048
02:14:52,188 --> 02:14:53,938
"keeps you safe from danger."

2049
02:14:55,728 --> 02:14:57,978
"He spends his life
imagining your needs"

2050
02:14:58,148 --> 02:15:00,439
"thinking about what you can't see."

2051
02:15:04,029 --> 02:15:05,439
"Maybe he's tired."

2052
02:15:05,859 --> 02:15:07,530
"Always caring for others."

2053
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:10,280
"Maybe one day, he'll be done."

2054
02:15:11,150 --> 02:15:12,440
"That could happen."

2055
02:15:17,531 --> 02:15:19,401
And I remember at the end,

2056
02:15:21,231 --> 02:15:23,191
he said, "One day",

2057
02:15:23,361 --> 02:15:26,322
"when it's time
for him to go, he'll go."

2058
02:15:27,442 --> 02:15:30,942
"You won't be able to help it.
Prepare yourself, it'll be hard."

2059
02:15:31,112 --> 02:15:33,533
"But it won't be
the end of your life."

2060
02:15:40,113 --> 02:15:41,654
He meant himself.

2061
02:15:42,484 --> 02:15:43,734
Now...

2062
02:15:45,154 --> 02:15:47,284
Now I know he meant himself.

2063
02:15:53,985 --> 02:15:57,156
I implore the jurors to bear in mind

2064
02:15:57,366 --> 02:15:59,616
this story is extremely subjective.

2065
02:16:00,036 --> 02:16:03,946
In no way does it qualify
as any form of proof.

2066
02:16:24,329 --> 02:16:28,199
Yes Serge, we are still
outside the courthouse in Grenoble.

2067
02:16:28,369 --> 02:16:31,290
The trial was scheduled
to end on Friday,

2068
02:16:31,450 --> 02:16:33,910
but Sandra Voyter's son Daniel

2069
02:16:34,080 --> 02:16:36,410
insisted on testifying again
this morning.

2070
02:16:36,580 --> 02:16:38,160
The jury is still...

2071
02:16:53,972 --> 02:16:54,992
Daniel.

2072
02:16:55,372 --> 02:16:58,953
Mrs Voyter, how do you feel...

2073
02:16:59,163 --> 02:17:01,293
after being acquitted?

2074
02:17:02,393 --> 02:17:05,974
There were too many words
in this trial.

2075
02:17:06,294 --> 02:17:07,704
I've nothing more to say.

2076
02:17:08,204 --> 02:17:11,454
I want to call my son and go home.

2077
02:17:12,544 --> 02:17:16,585
Obviously I thank my lawyers,
who always believed in me.

2078
02:17:16,745 --> 02:17:19,375
Mr. Renzi, are you relieved?

2079
02:17:19,545 --> 02:17:21,706
I commend the jury,

2080
02:17:22,046 --> 02:17:24,626
who saw Sandra Voyter as she is...

2081
02:18:26,383 --> 02:18:28,254
Marge, it's Sandra.

2082
02:18:30,344 --> 02:18:32,884
Yes, it's incredible, we're relieved.

2083
02:18:36,925 --> 02:18:39,135
Does Daniel want to talk to me?

2084
02:18:41,595 --> 02:18:43,845
Of course, he must be tired,

2085
02:18:44,075 --> 02:18:45,276
I understand.

2086
02:18:47,096 --> 02:18:50,006
Does he mind if I come home tonight?

2087
02:18:50,236 --> 02:18:52,106
Would he prefer tomorrow, or...

2088
02:18:57,007 --> 02:18:58,717
OK, OK.

2089
02:18:59,427 --> 02:19:03,008
We'll get some dinner,
then I'll be home. See you then.

2090
02:19:06,558 --> 02:19:08,008
I need a drink.

2091
02:19:12,579 --> 02:19:13,829
Another!

2092
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:24,010
Do you always...

2093
02:19:24,180 --> 02:19:27,311
When you win,
do you always do this?

2094
02:19:27,471 --> 02:19:28,851
We never win.

2095
02:19:30,561 --> 02:19:33,351
That's the fucking first time
in our life we win!

2096
02:19:33,511 --> 02:19:34,851
- No!
- Yes, of course!

2097
02:19:35,011 --> 02:19:37,012
You told me you're a good lawyer.

2098
02:19:40,512 --> 02:19:41,762
No, it's not true!

2099
02:19:41,882 --> 02:19:42,882
It's not spicy.

2100
02:19:42,972 --> 02:19:44,763
You have to try this, really.

2101
02:19:44,973 --> 02:19:46,263
We ate too much.

2102
02:19:46,433 --> 02:19:47,513
I'm gonna throw up.

2103
02:19:47,723 --> 02:19:49,353
A quick smoke first.

2104
02:19:49,683 --> 02:19:50,763
Be right back.

2105
02:19:55,514 --> 02:19:56,814
You first.

2106
02:20:10,686 --> 02:20:12,476
It's not so easy, huh?

2107
02:20:14,146 --> 02:20:15,976
With all the bones, and...

2108
02:20:20,607 --> 02:20:21,817
After this, we go?

2109
02:20:22,147 --> 02:20:23,687
Ready to go home?

2110
02:20:24,517 --> 02:20:27,108
I can drive, I can drive you.

2111
02:20:28,268 --> 02:20:29,318
One more.

2112
02:20:30,108 --> 02:20:31,518
For the road.

2113
02:20:32,858 --> 02:20:34,729
Of course, for the driver.

2114
02:20:35,819 --> 02:20:36,899
Same?

2115
02:20:45,070 --> 02:20:46,770
Can I just get

2116
02:20:46,980 --> 02:20:49,190
two more of these? Thanks.

2117
02:21:05,362 --> 02:21:06,402
To you.

2118
02:21:21,694 --> 02:21:22,864
Are you alright?

2119
02:21:27,075 --> 02:21:28,275
Tell me.

2120
02:21:28,985 --> 02:21:30,985
I just, I thought...

2121
02:21:32,576 --> 02:21:35,116
I thought I'd feel relieved.

2122
02:21:38,776 --> 02:21:40,616
It doesn't come right away.

2123
02:21:42,737 --> 02:21:43,907
Sure?

2124
02:21:44,077 --> 02:21:45,157
Not sure.

2125
02:21:48,527 --> 02:21:50,988
It's just, you know,
when you lose, you lose.

2126
02:21:51,578 --> 02:21:53,528
It's the worst thing that can happen,

2127
02:21:53,698 --> 02:21:55,118
and if you win...

2128
02:21:57,699 --> 02:22:00,659
you expect some reward.

2129
02:22:02,199 --> 02:22:03,659
But there isn't any.

2130
02:22:04,489 --> 02:22:05,659
It's just...

2131
02:22:07,530 --> 02:22:08,950
It's just over.

2132
02:22:13,910 --> 02:22:16,701
Maybe sometimes,
we expect too much.

2133
02:22:19,991 --> 02:22:21,241
Yeah, maybe.

2134
02:23:26,999 --> 02:23:28,249
Hi.

2135
02:23:29,249 --> 02:23:30,590
Sorry.

2136
02:23:32,540 --> 02:23:35,130
He tried to wait up but fell asleep.

2137
02:24:24,426 --> 02:24:25,966
I'll be going now.

2138
02:24:26,136 --> 02:24:27,346
Not staying over?

2139
02:24:27,506 --> 02:24:29,387
No, I'll leave you be.

2140
02:24:35,717 --> 02:24:36,887
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

2141
02:24:54,050 --> 02:24:56,180
I was afraid of you coming home.

2142
02:24:57,930 --> 02:25:01,050
Me too,
I was afraid to come home.
