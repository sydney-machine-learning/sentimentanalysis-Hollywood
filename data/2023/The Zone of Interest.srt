1
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,719
Go past me children.

2
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,959
There are some to my left

3
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,159
and some ahead here.

4
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,559
Yes.

5
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,639
Sleep child sleep.

6
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,919
Don't sit on me.

7
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,119
I didn't sit on you.

8
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,039
That's what happens when you stamp on my foot.

9
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,119
You'd better not throw a
bucket of water over me.

10
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,719
No, we'd never do that.

11
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,599
It better not make me late.

12
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,119
This way... and out.

13
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,039
Watch out for the steps.

14
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,399
Feel for it... and down. Perfect.

15
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,679
Last step, and now turn around.

16
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,159
...

17
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,519
Where you go. Wait. Stand here.

18
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,559
Surprise.

19
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,679
Is this for me?

20
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,639
Yes.

21
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,399
Thank you.

22
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,239
Happy birthday.

23
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,759
Where did you get it?

24
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,119
I have my sources.

25
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,239
 One, two, three passengers.

26
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,239
Who wants the first ride?

27
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,079
Me.

28
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,999
You.

29
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,599
You can have the first ride.

30
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,999
The paint is still fresh.

31
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,759
Annagret will have a green bottom.

32
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,239
Coats, hags, off to school.

33
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,759
Thank you, children.

34
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,479
Goodbye.

35
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,199
Inge, pull your socks up.

36
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,919
Bye bye Daddy.

37
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,919
Phlox.

38
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,079
Would you like to smell a rose?

39
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,239
Smell a rose. Yes. This one.

40
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,199
This one is beautiful.

41
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,399
Look, what a big dahlia.

42
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,959
And a ladybird. Yes.

43
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,399
Bronek.

44
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,919
Marta.

45
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,399
Upstairs please.

46
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,519
Then come and see me.

47
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,759
Sophie.

48
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,119
Aniela, come.

49
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,159
Choose something you like.

50
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,119
Only one each.

51
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,519
Take something.

52
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,119
This one needs to be cleaned

53
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,199
and the lining has to be mended.

54
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,439
Be careful with it.

55
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,239
Of course.

56
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,999
Go back downstairs.

57
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,159
The bees are flying.

58
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,079
It is hot, isn't it?

59
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,679
How was your journey?

60
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,279
...

61
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,279
Long. But we're here now.

62
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,319
Yes indeed. So, not too bad?

63
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,839
No, not too bad.

64
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,439
Easier than last time actually.

65
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,799
Excellent. Well then, welcome back.

66
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,319
Absolutely. We're glad to be here.

67
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,279
Should we take our shoes off as well?

68
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,199
No.

69
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,239
Did you travel via Prague or Vienna?

70
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,039
Prague. It is 56 minutes faster.

71
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,039
She asked me where I got

72
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,479
one of my jackets from.

73
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,839
I said, "Canada."

74
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,599
And she asked, "How did you get to Canada?"

75
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,359
She thought you meant the country?

76
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,239
Yes, of course.

77
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,999
An understandable mistake.

78
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,919
The same thing happened when Helga Pattisch

79
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,159
came for the first time.

80
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,719
Out of all of the clothes, she chose a dress

81
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,039
Out of all of the clothes, she chose a dress

82
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,119
that belonged to some little
Jewess half her size.

83
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,399
I could only pull the zipper up to here

84
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,919
and the dress came apart.

85
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,119
And ! pulled and pulled at it.

86
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,839
She just looked down at herself and said

87
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,679
"I love this dress."

88
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,559
In the end she took it.

89
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,519
And she said, "I'll go on a diet."

90
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,879
Would you like more coffee?

91
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,279
Yes please. Thank you.

92
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,559
You take it black?

93
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,919
Black is good, thank you.

94
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,759
Helga's husband only adopted

95
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,159
that little Polish bay to keep her at home

96
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,279
That's what she told me.

97
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,719
And he hits her as well.

98
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,919
And he hits her as well.

99
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,759
I didn't know that.

100
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,199
How do you know that?

101
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,199
Haven't you noticed the bruises on her arms?

102
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,081
Haven't you noticed the bruises on her arms?

103
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,639
I forgot to tell you something.

104
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,599
Guess where I found this diamond?

105
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,839
In the toothpaste

106
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,439
No. Really?

107
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,359
How clever you must have to be.

108
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,719
Yes, they are very.

109
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,519
I've ordered more toothpaste

110
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,799
because you never know.

111
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,575
I think I told you above
the Schilling concert.

112
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,295
About Brigitte Frank's ermine fur coat.

113
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,439
Did I tell you about it?

114
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,719
I don't think so.

115
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,519
Look.

116
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,439
She looks like an empress.

117
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,839
The other side of it is the next chamber

118
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,839
with the next load ready to burn

119
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,919
once the pieces here

120
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,079
have been completely incinerated.

121
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,359
How long does it take?

122
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,759
7 hours, 400 to 500 at a time.

123
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,239
Closer to 500.

124
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,719
So, once that has happened,

125
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,119
you close this chimney,

126
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,479
then simultaneously open the next.

127
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,359
The fire will follow the air,

128
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,319
through this baffle of course,

129
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,999
into this chamber and then burn this load.

130
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,559
The chamber directly opposite
the combustion zone,

131
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,879
which burns at roughly 1,000 degrees,

132
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:48,439
has by now cooled to around 40 degrees.

133
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,479
Cool enough to unload the ash

134
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,679
and then reload the chamber.

135
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,999
So, this chamber is cooling

136
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,559
while this one is heating up?

137
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,639
Correct. The process moves one chamber over,

138
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,279
counterclockwise.

139
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,639
So, burn, cool, unload, reload.

140
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,079
And...

141
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,279
Continuously.

142
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,559
Cheers.

143
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,679
Dilla.

144
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,039
Happy birthday, Commandant.

145
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,239
Happy birthday, Commandant.

146
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,639
Itis an honour to serve under you.

147
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,359
Thank you.

148
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,879
Happy birthday, Commandant.

149
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,839
Thank you.

150
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,159
Happy birthday, Commandant.

151
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,439
Thank you.

152
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,439
That is a rifle.

153
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,959
And this is also a rifle.

154
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,679
And here is one with a pistol,

155
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,879
and another rifle here.

156
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,999
Do you hear that?

157
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,559
It's a bittern. A heron.
A Eurasian grey heron.

158
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,679
You cried like this too.

159
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,079
You were even louder.

160
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,959
What's going on with her?

161
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,359
She's strong, isn't she?

162
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,919
I'd like to try mine now.

163
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,439
What are you doing?

164
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,039
What are you doing?

165
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,959
I'm looking.

166
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,719
At what?

167
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,959
Teeth.

168
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,119
What are you doing?

169
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,039
Nothing.

170
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,439
What are you doing here?

171
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,039
I'm handing out sugar.

172
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,839
Who to?

173
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,159
I'm looking.

174
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,119
Come.

175
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,839
Then, a little white bird flew past

176
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,319
to guide them out of the forest.

177
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,439
Soon they arrived at a huge lake.

178
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,879
They were puzzled as they
did not know how to cross it.

179
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,639
Suddenly, a big beautiful swan
came swimming towards them.

180
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,639
"Oh beautiful swan, please be our boat."

181
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,479
The swan bent its neck and came to the shore.

182
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,399
Bracht phoned the house.

183
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,239
Yes, while you were outside for your toast.

184
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,559
I forgot to tell you.

185
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,759
He said he'd call back tomorrow, midday.

186
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,039
Rudolf.

187
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,079
Will you take me to that spa in ltaly again?

188
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,239
All that pampering.

189
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,839
And the walks. And that nice couple we met.

190
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,879
Is she wandering around again?

191
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,039
No.

192
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,399
And that man

193
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,559
who played the accordion to the cows?

194
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,799
They loved it.

195
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,879
It was so funny.

196
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,839
All looking at him like this.

197
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,159
Will you?

198
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,639
What?

199
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,399
Well, take me back there.

200
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,199
When?

201
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,479
I don't know when.

202
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,599
You smell nice.

203
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,599
It's French.

204
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,319
Oink, oink.

205
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,799
Chocolate. If you see it. Any goodies.

206
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,319
To the head of the Party Chancellery

207
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,479
Reichsleiter Bormann.

208
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,359
Personal.

209
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,399
Dear Reichsleiter

210
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,759
I have learned that the commandant
of the gigantic K.L. Auschwitz

211
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,239
Obersturmbannführer Höss

212
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,959
also well known to you,

213
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,279
is to be transferred.

214
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,679
Comrade Höss has made
unprecedented achievements

215
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,439
over four years of painstaking work.

216
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,479
I witnessed the construction
of this great camp close up

217
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,119
so can attest.

218
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,839
Reichsführer Himmler himself acknowledges

219
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,599
the uniqueness of what he built.

220
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,159
Now it is said that the
task is too big for him

221
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,999
and that someone must take his place.

222
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,239
Höss knows prisoner use inside out

223
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,119
has close contacts with the
Silesian armaments industry

224
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,919
and has brought groundbreaking ideas

225
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,439
to the whole field of KL practice.

226
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,319
He is a model settler farmer

227
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,679
and an exemplary German pioneer of the East.

228
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,559
His particular strength is
turning theory into practice.

229
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,679
I will refrain from listing more qualities

230
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,959
which prove a change in his
command is not possible.

231
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,479
Therefore, could you please speak

232
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,039
to the Reichsführer as soon as possible

233
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,079
to prevent the transfer of Comrade Höss.

234
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,839
I would be very grateful for a brief reply.

235
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,519
Hell Hitler.

236
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,079
Gauleiter Fritz Bracht.

237
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,519
Can I do it now?

238
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,399
In a moment.

239
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,839
Did you know that storks

240
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,159
fly as far as Africa?

241
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,239
How far do you think they fly?

242
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,919
How many kilometers?

243
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,839
300?

244
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,399
More.

245
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,319
All these weeds here.

246
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,599
You are what you say.

247
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,279
You are what you say.

248
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,719
Cows find this funny.

249
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,799
The whale farm is roaring,
because you are so boring.

250
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,519
Cows find this funny.

251
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,799
The whole farm is roaring,
because you are so boring.

252
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,799
No, you're boring.

253
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,599
All is well.

254
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,559
I hate you.

255
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,199
Keep your eyes closed, or it'll hurt.

256
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,079
I know.

257
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,399
Once more. All good. Come here.

258
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,079
We have 10 rinse your eyes.

259
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,799
Everything's fine. You'll live.

260
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,399
...with which 60,000 Italian spectators

261
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,159
showered their victorious national team.

262
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,719
We will be able to share in their delight.

263
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,639
How long it's been since Milan saw

264
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,879
their beloved Squadra Azzurra?

265
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,039
And now they have returned with a 4-0 victory

266
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,839
to the arena of their many triumphs.

267
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,479
Can you imagine the celebration?

268
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,439
4-0 against their old rivals Spain,

269
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,559
who are again aspiring to a position of power

270
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,319
in European football,

271
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,559
as we Germans saw with our own eyes

272
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,159
in Berlin last Sunday.

273
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,519
But don't let the result fool you.

274
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,999
4-0 was the final score.

275
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,559
But at half time

276
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,559
this thrilling Italian-Spanish encounter

277
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,839
stood at 0-0.

278
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,119
Hang up.

279
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,319
Fritz.

280
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,119
Go on.

281
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,719
What does it say?

282
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,279
Well.

283
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,719
No, you wrote a very powerful
letter on my behalf.

284
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,479
Their minds were obviously made up.

285
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,039
I'd better tell my wife.

286
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,279
She might.

287
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,639
The train stopped for ages at Krakow.

288
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,279
How frustrating.

289
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,239
And it was so hot.

290
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,079
A lady fainted next to me, it was that hot.

291
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,679
She's moving here with her husband,

292
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,159
who's an engineer. He's a lot older.

293
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,039
Yes.

294
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,199
They've both got jobs at a new factory.

295
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,159
Siemens.

296
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,919
Ah, yes. That's possible.

297
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,639
All the big companies are here, he said.

298
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,999
Yes, yes.

299
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,359
Don't you need to get on?

300
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,919
Yes. I'd better.

301
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,479
I'll show Mum to the girls' room.

302
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,799
Are you ready?

303
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,159
You'll have Heideraud’s bed

304
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,719
You'll have Heideraud’s bed

305
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,639
and she'll get in with Inge-Brigitt.

306
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,039
You don't mind, do you?

307
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,959
-
Of course not.

308
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,879
The house looks big, but it actually isn't.

309
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,599
The first thing we did

310
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,199
was install central heating.

311
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,279
It gets so cold in winter.

312
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,719
You wouldn't believe it.

313
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,879
Hand-painted.

314
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,439
Really?

315
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,319
Yes.

316
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,639
This is Heideraud's bed here.

317
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,599
This is lovely.

318
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:47,879
Truly.

319
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,359
Such a lovely room.

320
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,599
The top two drawers are for you.

321
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,879
Yes, that's more than enough.

322
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,159
Such beautiful flowers.

323
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,039
Yes, try it.

324
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,919
But I'm sleeping here?

325
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,199
Yes, but they're both...

326
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,439
...the same.

327
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,079
My girl.

328
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,359
That's spinach strudel, apple strudel,

329
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,639
potato salad.

330
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,919
And your cinnamon rolls.

331
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,559
My recipe?

332
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,559
Very nice.

333
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,799
My god.

334
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,919
Subject:

335
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,039
Lilac bushes by the commandants
guard barracks.

336
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,959
From now on, SS members who pick lilacs

337
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,599
in a thoughtless and blatant manner

338
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,039
so that the bushes bleed

339
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,999
will be punished.

340
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,199
I expect the SS members,

341
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,959
if they wish to take some,

342
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,319
to do it in a way

343
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,079
that does not damage the bushes.

344
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,559
In the interest of our whole community,

345
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,199
I hope you understand

346
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,159
that the lilac bushes

347
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,959
are intended to decorate our entire camp

348
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,359
both now and in the future.

349
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,439
Jews in the house?

350
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,479
The Jews are over the other side of the wall.

351
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,159
They're local girls.

352
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,319
Say hello to grandma.

353
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,279
Hello.

354
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,199
My God.

355
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,439
He's got so big, and you have such nice hair.

356
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,519
I think it's your turn to push, isn't it Hans?

357
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,959
Inge pushed you before

358
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,279
and now it's your turn. Go on.

359
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,999
Let's go.

360
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,959
This is all us.

361
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,559
There's a grape vine.

362
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,999
Obviously, it'll grow.

363
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,279
it's huge.

364
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,799
I'm speechless.

365
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,559
It's all my design.

366
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,079
All the planting and everything.

367
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,919
The greenhouse, the gazebo at the end.

368
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,119
Is that a pool?

369
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,959
Yes.

370
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,719
I have gardeners. I couldn't do it alone.

371
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,639
With a slide?

372
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,079
Oh Heddy.

373
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,479
Do you like it?

374
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,159
Of course I like it. How could I not?

375
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,959
Of course I like it. How could I not?

376
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,359
This was a field three years ago.

377
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,759
No.

378
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,559
We just had the lower garden by the street.

379
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,559
And the house had a flat roof.

380
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,719
It's hard to believe.

381
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,559
And that's the camp wall?

382
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,239
Yes, that's the camp wall.

383
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,799
We planted more vines at the back

384
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,719
to grow and cover it.

385
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,279
Maybe Esther Silberman is over there.

386
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,239
Which one was she?

387
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,759
The one I used to clean for.

388
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,999
She was the one who had the book readings.

389
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,839
God knows what they were up to.

390
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,319
Bolshevik stuff.

391
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,719
Jewish stuff.

392
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,679
And I got outbid on her curtains

393
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,879
And I got outbid on her curtains

394
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,519
at the street auction.

395
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,279
Her opposite, she got them.

396
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,679
I loved those curtains.

397
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,359
These flowers are so beautiful.

398
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,319
The azaleas there.

399
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,479
There are also vegetables.

400
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,359
A few herbs. Rosemary.
Beetroot. This is fennel.

401
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,639
Sunflowers.

402
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,636
And here is kohlrabi. The
children love to eat it.

403
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,530
Cabbage. Kale. Runner beans.

404
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,519
Pumpkins.

405
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,719
Potatoes and more.

406
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,759
We have bees over here to provide our honey.

407
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,319
It's a paradise garden.

408
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,719
And Rudolf is okay?

409
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,319
Yes, he's fine.

410
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,479
Working non-stop, even when he's home.

411
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,799
Working non-stop, even when he's home.

412
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,439
Which he loves.

413
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,279
He's a busy bee.

414
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,239
He is. Non-stop.

415
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,199
And under pressure like you wouldn't believe.

416
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,599
And you're okay?

417
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,039
Do I look okay?

418
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,799
Rudi calls me the Queen of Auschwitz.

419
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,079
Honestly.

420
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,639
To have all this.

421
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,879
You really have landed on your feet, my child.

422
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,759
The linden trees are turning yellow.

423
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,639
It smelled so nice when they were flowering.

424
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,199
This will grow and cover everything.

425
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,519
You'll see next time you visit.

426
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,119
No.

427
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:13,639
Stop it.

428
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:29,239
The heartfelt time we spent in the Hoss house

429
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,519
will always be

430
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,239
among our most beautiful holiday memories.

431
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,639
In the East lies our tomorrow.

432
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:46,639
Thanks for your National Socialist hospitality.

433
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:52,399
And this was from... Willy... Billy...

434
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,359
Hans says you have his sandals.

435
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,159
We have to leave, Mutzi.

436
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,199
Leave where?

437
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,919
Here. We have to go. We're being transferred.

438
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,639
Sorry, what?

439
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,039
We're being transferred.

440
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,039
To where?

441
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,439
Oranienburg.

442
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,799
What?

443
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,359
They're swapping me for Arthur Liebehenschel.

444
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,559
He comes here.

445
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,719
I take over as Deputy Inspector.

446
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,599
If you've known this for a
while, why tell me now?

447
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,279
There was no good moment to say it.

448
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,599
You've said it now.

449
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,199
Where are you going?

450
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,239
To get the sandals.

451
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,519
When did you find out?

452
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,159
Pohl told me last week.

453
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,719
I tried to make it go away.

454
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,839
Then call, Bormann.

455
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,079
I've tried Bormann.

456
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,519
Should I go to Hitler now?

457
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,439
Well, yes.

458
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,079
Rudolf.

459
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:29,919
Rudolf.

460
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,639
Don't turn your back on me.

461
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,799
Stop.

462
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,959
Calm down. Go back to the party.

463
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,172
You can't do this to me.

464
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,359
What is this? Marta.

465
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,599
Mrs Höss?

466
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,399
What's this, "Mrs Höss? Mrs Höss?"

467
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,519
I'll show you Mrs Höss.

468
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,559
Mop it up.

469
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,119
Don't forget you live well in our house.

470
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,159
Bloody hell.

471
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:05,879
Now.

472
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,479
Bloody hell.

473
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,159
Why are they transferring you?

474
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,199
Structural changes.

475
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,599
What does that mean?

476
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,719
They weren't specific.

477
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,079
But I'm not the only one being moved.

478
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,079
There are lots of us.

479
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,759
When?

480
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,519
Soon.

481
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,799
How soon?

482
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,239
I'm waiting to be told.

483
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:34,799
I'm waiting to be told.

484
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,679
If it's about the investigation
they should call Himmler.

485
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,719
if it's about the investigation
they should call Himmier.

486
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,759
He encouraged us.

487
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,479
No.

488
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,519
So it's not that?

489
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,919
It's a political matter.

490
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,719
Then go to Hitler.

491
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,999
Don't be ridiculous.

492
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,079
It's not ridiculous.

493
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,559
You're the one who carries out his orders

494
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,279
once you peel away the layers.

495
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,679
We have to face facts. We have to leave.

496
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,399
No.

497
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,159
You have to leave.

498
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:12,999
Yes.

499
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,999
Your work is in Oranienburg now.

500
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,039
Mine is raising our children,

501
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,239
and I'll do that from here.

502
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,599
I never thought that you wouldn't be with me.

503
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,759
Never crossed my mind.

504
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,479
They'd have to drag me out of here.

505
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,119
You know that.

506
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,799
This is our home.

507
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,039
We're living how we dreamed we would.

508
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,079
Since we were 17. Beyond how we dreamed.

509
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,855
Out of the city finally.

510
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,439
Everything we want. On our doorstep.

511
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,639
And our children are strong,
healthy and happy.

512
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,639
Everything the Fuhrer said

513
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,479
about how to live is how we do.

514
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,199
Go East. Living space.

515
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,439
This is our living space.

516
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,199
This is our living space.

517
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,239
I know you agree with me.

518
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,279
Arthur can find somewhere else to live.

519
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,959
He doesn't need to take our home.

520
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,599
You should make it a condition.

521
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,199
It's the least they can do.

522
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,999
He'll want a townhouse, anyway.

523
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,599
Rudolf?

524
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,679
I heard you.

525
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,319
So?

526
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,239
I'll ask.

527
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,879
You'll be working all the time.

528
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,439
Yes.

529
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,279
We'd never see you.

530
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:19,919
No.

531
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,639
I'll miss you, of course.

532
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,839
But you'll come home when you can.

533
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,359
I‘ll be...

534
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,639
with you. Just like you'll be with me.

535
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:02,919
Yes?

536
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,959
And after the war

537
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,279
when everything is over, we'll farm.

538
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,919
Like we said.

539
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,359
Do you all understand?

540
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,559
Yes.

541
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,599
So, I'll be missing your birthday.

542
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,559
And maybe even our anniversary.

543
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,119
Depending on how long I'll be gone.

544
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,399
So, those are some of the things

545
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,999
that definitely add to the struggle.

546
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,319
But the life we enjoy

547
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,599
is very much worth the sacrifice.

548
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,679
It's time for bed.

549
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,519
Hans, your plate.

550
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,799
Be calm.

551
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,839
It'll be hard for you too.

552
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,759
I know that.

553
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,719
Don't you think I know that?

554
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,039
I know that.

555
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:58,959
I love you.

556
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,959
I love you, my beauty.

557
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,039
Call Walter Dürrfeld first thing and
see if he can join us at selection.

558
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,479
Tell him they're Dutch

559
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,239
and he can have his pick.

560
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,599
Otherwise, I'll see him at the IG lunch.

561
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,919
Letter to Messrs. Prifer and Sander,

562
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,959
Topf and Sons.

563
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,039
Subject: New Crematorium.

564
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,599
I'm glad you were able to
make the journey last week.

565
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,119
SS-Obersturmbannführer
Bischoff and I both agree

566
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,639
the ring crematorium is
definitely the answer.

567
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,959
What a difference it will make.

568
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,239
Bravo.

569
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,439
I welcome your...

570
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,959
I welcome your suggestion

571
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,559
that the design should be patented

572
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,959
in order to secure priority.

573
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,959
I will follow up with a letter of intent.

574
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,639
You should be aware,

575
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,319
I've been promoted to Deputy Inspector

576
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,559
of concentration camps at the IKL.

577
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,599
Come.

578
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,399
And therefore, future communications

579
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,519
will be from Oranienburg-Berlin.

580
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,159
The focus there is now on labour.

581
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,799
Of course, this direction will affect our plans

582
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,639
and though it pains me to leave Auschwitz

583
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:51,679
I believe I'll be in a better position

584
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,959
to push for funds and materials

585
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,919
from there.

586
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,199
Heil Hitler. Et cetera.

587
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,479
Letter to Gruppenführer Glücks, IKL.

588
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,519
Subject: Transfer.

589
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,439
Dear Gruppenführer Glücks,

590
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,519
I would like my family to remain

591
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,039
at 88 Bielitzstrasse, KL Auschwitz

592
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,999
for the duration of my transfer.

593
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,199
It would be a great favour to me

594
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,959
for this to be permitted.

595
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,999
I must stress what a wonderful environment

596
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,359
Hedwig is making for the
children since settling here.

597
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,439
An inspiration in many ways

598
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:09,519
for our new German community in the East.

599
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,799
If this is acceptable,

600
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,079
provision of a simple lodging for myself

601
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,599
in Oranienburg will suffice.

602
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,359
I would be very grateful for a speedy answer.

603
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,719
Heil Hitler, et cetera.

604
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,799
Sweaty.

605
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,919
The little snow white bird flew down and sang,

606
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,639
"Be warned, be warned."

607
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:32,279
Gretel understood what the witch had in mind

608
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,279
and said, "Please show me first,

609
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,359
I don't know how to do that."

610
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:43,359
The witch sat on the shovel

611
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,639
and Gretel pushed her into the oven,

612
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,919
as deep as she could.

613
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:56,279
Then she closed the iron door of the oven.

614
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,239
And secured it with a bar.

615
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,919
The witch got cooked alive

616
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:06,639
as a punishment for her horrible deeds.

617
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,159
Gretel ran straight to Hansel,

618
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:15,359
unlocked the goose cage and let him out.

619
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,159
He jumped out

620
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,359
and threw his arms around his sister's neck.

621
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,919
They kissed one another,

622
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,119
cried with joy, and thanked God.

623
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,959
The little white bird sang,

624
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,719
"Pearls and gems for bread crumbs.”

625
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,599
(Polish)
Here you are at last.

{\i1}For soon we'll see

642
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:58,615
{\i1}that wawing flag

643
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:05,135
{\i1}The flag of freedom

644
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:14,651
{\i1}yet to come

645
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,919
Don't forget to stand straight.

646
01:10:32,741 --> 01:10:34,959
I've packed butter bread for you all.

647
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,679
Come on children. Hurry.

648
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:56,799
Sophie.

649
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,479
Tell her it's getting cold.

650
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,519
She's not here.

651
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:12,639
What?

652
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,239
She's gone.

653
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,199
What, not upstairs?

654
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,639
No, she's gone.

655
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,279
And her case has gone.

656
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,639
That cannot be.

657
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,399
Mum?

658
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,279
Go and look for her.

659
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,279
Aniela.

660
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,279
Take it away.

661
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,239
Was that here to spite me?

662
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,359
No, Mrs. Höss.

663
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,679
I could have my husband spread your ashes

664
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,839
across the fields of Babice.

665
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,919
Relax, let her find it.

666
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,799
Are you not going to be a commandant anymore?

667
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,639
I'll be head of all commandants.

668
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:44,679
I'll be head of all commandants.

669
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,799
Inspecting their camps, seeing
where improvements can be made.

670
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:53,839
Their yield, that kind of thing.

671
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,799
It has a great name.

672
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:03,199
It's girl's eye, or tickseed.

673
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,079
Girl's eye?

674
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,639
Girl's eye, yes.

675
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,319
I can only guess

676
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,959
that's because of its serrated petals,

677
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,919
because they resemble the long eyelashes

678
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:20,279
of women and girls.

679
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,319
You there.

680
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:10,959
Guard.

681
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,159
Bring him here.

682
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,319
What's he done?

683
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:28,359
Fighting over an apple, Commandant.

684
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,319
Drown him in the river.

685
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,199
Come.

686
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,119
Don't do that again.

687
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,119
Move it.

688
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,839
I don't care.

689
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,759
Move it.

690
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:57,839
Get it out.

691
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,919
Are you going to stand there trembling?

692
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:12,719
Something to say?

693
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,319
Come.

694
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,119
Aren't you lovely?

695
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,399
Yes, you are lovely.

696
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:02,839
Male or female?

697
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,559
Male.

698
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,519
How old?

699
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:05,239
4 years old.

700
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:06,519
What's his name?

701
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:07,119
Torin.

702
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:12,159
You don't see many with his colouring...

703
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,279
No, mostly black or salt and pepper.

704
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,919
I had a black one when I was little. Elsa.

705
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,239
Born on the same day I was.

706
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:21,719
He's lovely.

707
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:22,319
Thank you.

708
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:23,879
Come on.

709
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,919
On Sunday at 19h there
will be a benefit concert

710
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,959
at the Marksmen’s Club to raise 
money for War Winter Relief.

711
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,039
Junior Squad Leader Johann Thissen

712
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,159
will conduct the orchestra in
a two part programme

713
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,239

of Hungary's 700,000 Jews for extermination

741
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,559
and war production where able-bodied.

742
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,479
An agreement was reached

743
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:27,079
with the new Hungarian government

744
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,599
to begin the operation immediately.

745
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,399
They are being amassed

746
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,639
for transportation to Auschwitz.

747
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,959

01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,679

749
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:40,159
Firstly via the Eastern zones, 1 to 3.

750
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,799
Then via 4 and 5

751
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,679
in the middle of the country,

752
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:44,919
and finally, Budapest.

753
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,359
Pressburg and Vienna are heavily loaded

754
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,959
with military transports.

755
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:52,199
Jewish transports will pass through

756
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,199
Kassa and Muszyna instead.

757
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,999
Based on estimates provided
by Obersturmbannfiihrer Hiss,

758
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,199
25% will be retained for
labour after selection.

759
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,119
20% of those will be utilized

760
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,279
in Auschwitz sub-camps,

761
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,079
and the other 80%

762
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,479
will come to your camps in due course.

763
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:13,479
The scale is many times larger than before.

764
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,119
So prepare yourselves.

765
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,079
Before I hand over to
Obersturmbannfiihrer Höss,

766
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,239
I'd like to announce

767
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:21,599
the promotion of Colonel Maurer

768
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,199
to the rank of SS-Standartenfiihrer

769
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,479
for consistently hitting his labour targets.

770
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,279
Bravo.

771
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,879
I get fan mail from CEOs for this man.

772
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,319
More famous than me.

773
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,159
Thank you, sir.

774
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,639
Well deserved.

775
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:37,719
As I've said before,

776
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:39,519
I'm grateful for your leadership.

777
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,519
Thank you. You have said that.
I appreciate that.

778
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,639
Thank you, Obergruppenführer Pohl.

779
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,519
Good morning, everyone.

780
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,479
Good morning.

781
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,559
Two apologies for absence.

782
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,919
Sturmbannführer Férschner, Mittelbau-Dora.

783
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:53,359
Sturmbannführer Sauer, Riga-Kaiserwald.

784
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:55,679
You will appreciate

785
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,679
we have a very busy agenda today.

786
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,759
The Hungarian operation is urgent,

787
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,119
and complex,

788
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,399
and will involve converging challenges

789
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,799
at every operational level.

790
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,239
Please turn to the first page in your files.

791
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,519
You will see five headings.

792
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,079
Item one.

793
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,319
Timings.

794
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,439
Item two.

795
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,559

Item three.

797
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,279
Transportation.

798
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,959
For item four, prisoner workers.

799
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:26,879
Dr. Meindi from Steyr-Daimler-Puch,

800
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,999
some of you know him, some of you don't,

801
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,159
is joining us today

802
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,959
to discuss pay rates and incentives.

803
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:35,799
Item five.

804
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,759
and air defence measures.

805
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,159
The girls didn't want to go out.

806
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:43,839
Yes.

807
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,359
Because it is so cold.

808
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:50,679
Well, I love the snow.

809
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,119
Stop.

810
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:08,039
Leave me alone, Claus.

811
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,479
Stop it, Claus.

812
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,759
No.

813
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,079
Leave me alone, you traitor.

814
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:44,119
Saturday's funeral ceremony for the pupils

815
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,559
of the Air Force School

816
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,359
who died in the bombing raid

817
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:49,159
of March 6th will start at 11:30.

818
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,959
SS pall bearers should congregate

819
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:55,399
in the forecourt of the T Building by 10:45.

820
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:58,119
Transport will leave for Hans Schemm School

821
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,439
promptly at 11am.

822
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,079
Commander of the Guard

823
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,119
Obersturmbannführer Gustav Wegner

824
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,999
will lead the cortege to the cemetery

825
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,439
with a delegation from the
League of German Girls

826
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,839
and Air Force Students.

827
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,319
Obersturmbannfiihrer Höss.

828
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:25,599
Rudolf. Come on in.

829
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:26,999
How are you?

830
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:28,239
Good.

831
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,439
 I've just received this.

832
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,679
Obergruppenführer Poht met with

833
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:35,119
Reichsführer Himmler

834
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,519
to assess the numbers involved

835
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,359
and your name came up.

836
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,639
We're moving Liebehenschel to Majdanek.

837
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,439
He's not energetic enough for this.

838
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,279
Okay.

839
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:00,959
You'll receive operational
orders from Eichmann.

840
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,119
Perfect.

841
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:05,039
Tell me what resources you
need when you get there.

842
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:05,919
I will.

843
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:10,559
Any problems, come to me or Gerhard directly.

844
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:14,679
Thank you.

845
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,799
How's Hedwig?

846
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:17,839
Good.

847
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,119
Pohl told me she sends the boss

848
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,039
flowers from your garden every week.

849
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:22,639
Yes.

850
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,239
Get the job done.

851
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:26,759
I will. Thank you.

852
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:28,679
I appreciate the trust and confidence

853
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:29,479
you have in me.

854
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:41,519
And?

855
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:45,599
I'm not sure yet.

856
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:48,079
Relax.

857
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,119
He won't put them all up the chimney.

858
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:54,919
You'll get your workers.

859
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:56,879
You'll see.

860
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,119
Are you sleeping, okay?

861
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:11,759
Yes.

862
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,519
How many bowel movements
do you have per day?

863
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,319
Twice per day.

864
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,399
Urinating?

865
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:22,279
Without issues.

866
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:27,319
I'll feel around now. On the surface, first.

867
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:30,959
If there is any pain, then please let me know.

868
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:45,439
This is Höss.

869
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,279
Long-distance priority call,

870
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,479
KL Auschwitz, Höss private residence.

871
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,199
I'll stay on the line.

872
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:06,959
Are you there?

873
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:08,679
Hello?

874
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:09,759
Can you talk?

875
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:12,839
Is everything okay?

876
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:13,479
Yes.

877
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:14,599
I have news.

878
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,319
I told you I'd heard rumblings

879
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:17,519
but nothing concrete.

880
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,039
What news?

881
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,119
The Hungary thing.

882
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,479
The old man gave me orders from Heinrich.

883
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:26,399
It's happening at last.
I'm coming back to run it.

884
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,959
Well, I'm very relieved about that.

885
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,319
I have to admit, I'm pleased as Punch.

886
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:38,799
Yes.

887
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,479
I don't know, I go to Budapest first.

888
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:44,839
Things will be clearer after that.

889
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,039
Anyway, my cogs are turning.

890
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,159
I must get on.

891
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,799
I'll call you re party.

892
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,359
No. Wait, please

893
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,759
Tell Eleanor Pohl,

894
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,159
when she receives her parcel,

895
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:56,559
to look in the compact.

896
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:57,519
They're inside.

897
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,799
I heard Himmler's calling it Operation Höss.

898
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:23,039
That's fantastic. I'm so happy for you.

899
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:24,399
Thank you, Mutzi.

900
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:25,799
It's your name too.

901
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:27,759
Who was there?

902
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:29,559
To tell you the truth

903
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,199
I wasn't really paying attention.

904
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:34,159
I was too busy thinking

905
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:36,199
how I'd gas everyone in the room.

906
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,759
Very difficult, logistically,

907
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:40,439
because of its high ceiling.

908
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,119
It's the middle of the night

909
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,559
and I need to be in bed.

910
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:49,999
I shouldn't have called so late.

911
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:52,559
I was just excited to tell you the name.

912
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,599
You can tell me about it when you get back.

913
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,439
You have told them Daddy's coming home?

914
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:08,959
Yes.

915
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,319
Goodnight.
