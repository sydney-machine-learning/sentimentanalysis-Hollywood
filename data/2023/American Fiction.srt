1
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:51,386
<i>Okay, let's begin.</i>

2
00:00:57,226 --> 00:00:58,435
Who wants to start?

3
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:00,813
Yes, Brittany, kick it off.

4
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:04,775
I don't have a thought
on the reading,

5
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:07,778
I just think that that
word on the board is wrong.

6
00:01:09,238 --> 00:01:11,782
Well, I think it still has
two G's in it last I checked.

7
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,368
It's not funny.

8
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:16,578
We shouldn't have to stare
at the N-word all day.

9
00:01:17,955 --> 00:01:18,956
Uh, listen,

10
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,125
this is a class
on the literature

11
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:23,502
of the American south.

12
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:24,753
You're going to encounter

13
00:01:24,837 --> 00:01:27,506
some archaic thoughts,
coarse language,

14
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:29,299
but we're all adults here

15
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:31,635
and I think we can understand it

16
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:33,846
within the context in
which it's written.

17
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:36,974
Well, I just find that
word really offensive.

18
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:39,476
With all due respect, Brittany,

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,729
I got over it, I'm
pretty sure you can too.

20
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:43,813
Well, I don't see why.

21
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:50,237
Right.

22
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,447
Now, does anyone else have any

23
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,615
thoughts on the reading?

24
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:00,205
Well, it made some of your
students uncomfortable.

25
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:02,049
When did they all become
so goddamn delicate?

26
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:03,792
This wasn't an
isolated incident.

27
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:04,918
What?

28
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:06,461
Last month you asked a student

29
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:08,463
if his family had been Nazis.

30
00:02:08,547 --> 00:02:10,048
Yeah, I did, he's German,

31
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:11,651
we were reading <i>The
Plot Against America</i>

32
00:02:11,675 --> 00:02:14,177
and trust me, by the way he
was squirming, they were.

33
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:15,470
Oh, my God.

34
00:02:15,554 --> 00:02:18,348
Um, Monk, you are a
very talented writer,

35
00:02:18,432 --> 00:02:20,350
we're fortunate
to have you here.

36
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:22,895
What? He hasn't
published in years.

37
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:24,521
I have written three novels

38
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:26,106
since the last
time you published.

39
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:28,042
Yeah, this is true, and the
speed with which you write

40
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:29,693
only proves that good
things take time.

41
00:02:29,776 --> 00:02:32,112
- Oh, go to hell, Monk.
- Relax, Mandy.

42
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:33,655
Yeah, relax, Mandy.

43
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:35,449
And anyway, my new
book is with Echo

44
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:37,618
and my agent says they're
very excited about it.

45
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:39,453
Oh, that's great to hear.

46
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:42,164
- What's it about?
- Can we stop stalling, Leo?

47
00:02:43,624 --> 00:02:44,791
Um...

48
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,043
Listen, Monk,

49
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:49,755
we'd like to give you a break.

50
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:54,718
What do you mean, break?

51
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:56,011
Just some time off.

52
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:57,846
Mandatory time off.

53
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,515
It's just, you're already going
to Boston for the festival, right?

54
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,142
Why don't you just
stay there for...

55
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:04,102
Because I hate Boston,
my family's there.

56
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:05,771
Well, you need
some time to relax.

57
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:07,314
You're on edge, man.

58
00:03:07,397 --> 00:03:08,917
You're under the
impression that time spent

59
00:03:08,941 --> 00:03:11,193
with my family will
take the edge off.

60
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:12,861
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

61
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:14,821
I saw you crying in
your car last week.

62
00:03:14,905 --> 00:03:16,531
He punched the steering wheel.

63
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:17,908
Oh, wow.

64
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:21,703
You know, if you spent
less time spying on me,

65
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:23,287
you could

66
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,332
probably write a
dozen more novels

67
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:26,959
that people buy at airports

68
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:29,086
with their neck
pillows and Cheez-Its.

69
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:31,672
Oh, here we go. Okay. You
want to go, dirty doggy?

70
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:33,298
Okay, well, enjoy Boston.

71
00:03:33,382 --> 00:03:35,634
You can... you can get
my book at the airport.

72
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:37,844
Oh, and, good luck with Echo.

<i>That's Boston's version of

Any news?

92
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:59,926
Patrick at Echo is passing.
But who fucking cares?

93
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,928
<i>He's an old alcoholic.</i>

94
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:03,930
- What is that? Nine now?
- <i>He says,</i>

95
00:05:04,014 --> 00:05:06,308
"This book is finely crafted

96
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:09,061
with fully developed
characters and rich language,

97
00:05:09,144 --> 00:05:12,606
<i>but one is lost to understand
what this reworking of.</i>

98
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:15,358
Aeschylus' <i>The
Persians</i> has to do

99
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:16,794
"with the African-American
experience?"

100
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:17,861
<i>There it is.</i>

101
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:19,488
There it is.

102
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:20,614
<i>They want a Black book.</i>

103
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:21,948
They have a Black book.

104
00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:24,409
I'm Black, and it's my book.

105
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:25,827
You know what I mean.

106
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:28,413
<i>You mean they want me to write
about</i> a cop killing some teenager

107
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:30,749
or a single mom in
Dorchester raising five kids.

108
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:33,376
Dorchester is pretty
white now. But yes.

109
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:35,337
Jesus Christ. You know,

110
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,631
I don't even really
believe in race.

111
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:40,300
<i>Yeah. The problem is
that everyone else does.</i>

112
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:45,305
<i>Anyway, have fun at
the book festival.</i>

113
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:49,309
<i>And just don't insult
anyone important. Please.</i>

114
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:55,649
Writing from a
historical perspective

115
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:57,818
doesn't mean that you can't

116
00:05:57,901 --> 00:05:59,611
{\an8}make work that doesn't resonate

117
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,404
{\an8}with today's audiences.

118
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:04,908
{\an8}Yeah, I think of things like
<i>Game of Thrones</i> as proof that

119
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:08,245
nerds like us can still
find great success.

120
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:13,331
{\an8}Unfortunately, we're going
to have to end it there.

121
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:15,502
{\an8}Thank you to our authors

122
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:17,754
and thanks to all of
you for attending.

123
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:20,756
Um...

124
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:24,219
Is it just me, or was this small

125
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:26,012
even for a book festival?

126
00:06:26,096 --> 00:06:28,473
Yeah, it's because we're
up against Sintara.

127
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:30,267
Who?

128
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,394
Sintara Golden. You
haven't read her?

129
00:06:33,854 --> 00:06:35,397
No, what's her book called?

130
00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:39,985
Raves everywhere.

131
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:42,279
{\an8}<i>The Post, Bookforum.</i>

132
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:43,864
{\an8}The <i>London Review of Books</i> said,

133
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:46,199
<i>"We's Lives in Da Ghetto</i>

134
00:06:46,283 --> 00:06:49,494
is a heartbreaking
and visceral debut."

135
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:52,289
Plus a little birdie
told me that perhaps

136
00:06:52,372 --> 00:06:55,375
there's a TV adaptation
in the works?

137
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,586
No comment.

138
00:06:57,669 --> 00:06:59,796
Okay, it was worth a shot.

139
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:02,799
Tell us, what was your life like

140
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:04,593
before you were an author?

141
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:07,095
Well, I did undergrad at Oberlin

142
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:11,141
and moved to New York
the day after graduation

143
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:12,976
and a couple months later,

144
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:15,061
I was an assistant
at a publisher.

145
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:17,689
And did that assistant
experience shape your writing?

146
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:21,776
Absolutely. Yeah, I was
a first reader meaning

147
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,696
I would read all the
manuscripts in the slush pile

148
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,782
and send them up the ladder
if they were any good.

149
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:30,452
Some of them were
great, most were not.

150
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:35,707
But the feeling I
couldn't shake was that

151
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,710
no matter how good
the books were,

152
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:43,340
most every submission was from
some white dude from New York

153
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:44,466
going through a divorce,

154
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:47,552
and too few of them
were about my people.

155
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:49,679
And so I think,

156
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:51,681
"Where are our stories?"

157
00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:55,143
You know, "Where's
our representation?"

158
00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:57,437
And it was from that lack

159
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,356
that my book was born.

160
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:03,235
Would you give us the pleasure
of reading an excerpt?

161
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:07,322
Thank you.

162
00:08:12,744 --> 00:08:14,996
"'Yo, Cheranda,

163
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,123
where you be goin' in
a hurry likes that?'

164
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:19,918
Donna aks me when she see
me comin' out the house.

165
00:08:21,878 --> 00:08:23,421
'Ain't none ya business,

167
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:30,553
I looks back at the door
to see if Mama comin' out.

168
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:35,183
'The pharmacy?
What for?' she aks.

169
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,061
'You know', I says.

170
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:40,939
'Nah', she say.

171
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:45,568
'Hell, nah! Girl, you
be pregnant again?'

172
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:48,822
'Might's be', I tells her.

173
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:51,574
'And if I is,

174
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:54,744
"Ray-Ray's gonna be a real
father this time around.'"

175
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,165
Thank you.

176
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:04,629
Yes!

177
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:48,006
- Hi...
- Hi.

00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,632
I'm here to see Lisa Ellison.

179
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:50,818
Uh, do you have an appointment?

180
00:09:50,842 --> 00:09:51,885
We're about to close.

181
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:53,511
No, I'm her brother.

182
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:54,637
Oh.

183
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:55,721
There she is.

184
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:01,770
Hello, Monk.

185
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:05,690
Hi, Lisa.

186
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:17,118
Okay, you're in a boat,
the motor cuts out,

187
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:19,788
but you're in shallow water,

188
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:22,374
but you're wearing
$600 shoes, but

189
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,710
your ride to the airport

190
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:27,754
is just pulling
away from the beach,

191
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:31,424
why, oh, why is
this a legal issue?

192
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:35,387
I don't know.

193
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:38,681
It's a matter of
row versus wade.

194
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:39,933
Oh, my God.

195
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:43,728
I think that's one of my best.

196
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:44,813
Wow.

197
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:47,857
Okay.

198
00:10:51,653 --> 00:10:53,696
- When did you start smoking again?
- Mm...

199
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:56,991
Right after the divorce.

200
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:00,286
I always hated Larry.

201
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,621
Oh, I know.

202
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,015
You told me right when
we started dating.

203
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,416
Do you remember how mad I got?

204
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:05,984
"It's not your
business who I fuck!

205
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:07,419
Who I fellate."

206
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:09,879
I definitely did
not say "fellate."

207
00:11:09,963 --> 00:11:12,173
I thought you did. That's
how I heard it anyway.

208
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:14,884
It's good to see you.

209
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:18,430
Yeah, it's good to see you too.

210
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,143
How's work?

211
00:11:23,977 --> 00:11:25,311
It's not very glamorous.

212
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:29,315
I go through a metal
detector every day.

213
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:32,694
Well, what you do is important.

214
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:33,778
Well...

215
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:36,781
Meanwhile, all I do is

216
00:11:36,865 --> 00:11:38,533
invent little people in my head,

217
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:41,327
then make them have imaginary
conversations with each other.

218
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:44,205
Books change people's lives.

219
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,624
Did something I've written
ever change your life?

220
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,126
Absolutely.

221
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:49,878
Absolutely.

222
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:53,923
My dining room table
was wobbly as hell

223
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:55,341
before your last book came out.

224
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:57,153
- Oh, my God. All right.
- It was, like, perfect.

225
00:11:57,177 --> 00:11:58,487
- Yeah. Oh, God.
- I'm telling you and...

226
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:00,054
Take me back to Logan, please.

227
00:12:00,138 --> 00:12:01,431
Logan cannot help you, Monk.

228
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:03,391
Oh, my God!

229
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:05,685
Welcome home, baby!

230
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,151
Hello!

231
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:15,278
Hello!

232
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:22,535
- Mr. Monk!
- Lorraine!

233
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:25,622
Oh.

234
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:27,832
You know how that makes
me feel. It's just Monk.

235
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,292
Oh, don't do that to me,

236
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,003
you know I'm too old
to learn new names.

237
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:34,088
- How you doing, Miss Lisa?
- I'm good.

238
00:12:34,172 --> 00:12:37,008
- You look good, Mr. Monk.
- Oh, I look fat.

239
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:39,427
Oh, that's the
California talking.

240
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:40,970
I took you to
Arkansas right now,

241
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:42,472
- you'd be a beauty queen.
- Ooh!

242
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:44,474
- Is that my Monkie?
- That's frightening.

243
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:52,899
- Hi, Mother.
- Oh.

244
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:56,444
- You look fat.
- Ah, I know.

245
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:58,112
You ready to go to
dinner, Mrs. Ellison?

246
00:12:58,196 --> 00:13:00,323
Uh, I just need my purse
and my black cardigan.

247
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:01,491
All right, I'll get it.

248
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:03,159
- Are you all right?
- Oh.

249
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:04,953
You overeat when
you're depressed.

250
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:06,704
I'm not depressed,

251
00:13:06,788 --> 00:13:09,499
I've just been not
sleeping well lately

252
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:11,251
and so, fell off my
exercise routine.

253
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:12,418
- Mm.
- Here.

254
00:13:12,502 --> 00:13:14,045
So you're not depressed.

255
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:17,173
You just wear all the
hallmarks of depression.

256
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:20,301
I missed you.

257
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:23,972
Is Larry coming?

258
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:27,058
No, Mother.

259
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:30,812
Larry and I are
separated, remember?

260
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:33,439
- Of course, I remember.
- Okay.

261
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:35,984
I just thought he might join us.

262
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:38,361
To see your brother.

263
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,071
Okay.

264
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,826
I mean, is it really
such a big deal?

265
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,119
Everyone forgets things.

266
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:47,704
Doesn't mean she's
sick necessarily.

267
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:49,289
People forget
dentists' appointments.

268
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:53,001
She forgets I'm not
married anymore.

269
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:54,961
That's weird.

270
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:58,756
What do you suggest we do?

271
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,049
Why do I have to decide?

272
00:14:00,258 --> 00:14:02,510
- Because you're a doctor.
- So are you.

273
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:03,803
I'm not that kind.

274
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:07,181
Okay, my point is, you
are an intelligent adult.

275
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:09,976
And I'm tired of
being the only person

276
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:11,102
that takes care of her.

277
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,312
Well, I don't recall anyone

278
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:13,938
assigning you that
responsibility.

279
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:16,190
No, you and Cliff just fled
west as soon as you could

280
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:18,109
and left me as
caretaker by default.

281
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,611
My work's there.

282
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:21,130
- "My work's there." Yeah.
- Apologies that it prevents me

283
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:24,115
from keeping up with
the family melodrama.

284
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,552
If you lived up the block, you
wouldn't know what was going on.

285
00:14:26,576 --> 00:14:29,120
I'm stuck here taking care
of that old house and finding

286
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,164
love letters from Dad's affairs.

287
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:33,291
- His what?
- His affairs.

288
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:35,043
You didn't know he
was having affairs?

289
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:37,545
No. How did you?

290
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:39,756
Well, he was an OBGYN

291
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,299
that was traveling constantly,

292
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:43,343
but his patients were in Boston.

293
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:44,844
He said he was going
to conferences.

294
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,889
He was making house calls.

295
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:50,099
Do you know that I saw
him kiss a white woman

296
00:14:50,183 --> 00:14:51,809
in the park in high school?

297
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,478
How white?

298
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:54,771
What do you mean, "How white?"

299
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:56,898
Like Brahmin white
or Southie white.

300
00:14:56,981 --> 00:14:59,776
I don't know. She had thin lips.

301
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:01,194
She looked like a bad kisser.

302
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:03,780
Did you tell Mother?

303
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:06,574
No. I wasn't going
to blow up our lives.

304
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:08,326
She's coming back. Mom. Mom.

305
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,409
Mom. Mom.

306
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:10,453
Hi.

307
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,248
How you doing?

308
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,210
Our waitress isn't
wearing a bra.

309
00:15:17,877 --> 00:15:18,878
Okay.

310
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:20,462
I didn't notice.

311
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,051
<i>See this shit?</i>

312
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:26,803
<i>This gonna take us
out of the ghetto.</i>

313
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:28,388
<i>But there are
rules in the house.</i>

314
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:31,140
<i>Number one, never leave
this product in the house.</i>

315
00:15:31,224 --> 00:15:33,267
<i>And number two,
get your own crew.</i>

316
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:35,520
<i>Number three, got to have
discipline in your crew.</i>

317
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:38,106
<i>Number four, don't
praise a nigga too much.</i>

318
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:39,774
<i>Otherwise he's gonna
think you're soft.</i>

319
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:42,902
<i>Rule number five,
don't show no love.</i>

320
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,696
<i>Love will get you killed.</i>

321
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:47,198
<i>See this, it's like a bitch.</i>

322
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,159
<i>You fuck a bitch, don't
let a bitch fuck you.</i>

323
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:52,120
<i>You're a man who
don't need nothing.</i>

324
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:53,538
<i>No one will get you through.</i>

325
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:56,040
<i>This bitch? This bitch
will take your soul.</i>

326
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,543
<i>You niggas ain't got no fam...</i>

327
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:08,511
Excuse me, uh, Ned.

328
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:10,930
Do you have any books by the
writer Thelonious Ellison?

329
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:16,436
Yeah, this way.

330
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,734
- Here you go.
- Right.

331
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:24,277
Yeah.

332
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,362
Wait a minute, why
are these books here?

333
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,114
I'm not sure.

334
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:32,535
I would imagine that this
author Ellison is... Black.

335
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:35,246
That's me. Ellison. Yeah.

336
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:39,625
He is me, and he
and I are Black.

337
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:41,002
Oh, bingo.

338
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:43,212
No bingo, Ned, these books

339
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:45,715
have nothing to do with
African-American studies,

340
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:47,091
they're just literature.

341
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:49,051
The blackest thing about
this one is the ink.

342
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:53,765
I don't decide what
sections the books go in.

343
00:16:53,848 --> 00:16:56,642
No one here does. That's
how chain stores work.

344
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:58,936
Right, Ned.

345
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:01,689
You don't make the rules.

346
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,150
Hm.

347
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,611
I'm just going to put
them back after you leave.

348
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:08,362
Don't you dare, Ned.

349
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:10,782
Do not you dare.

350
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:14,035
Ned.

351
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:23,503
Monk, what are you doing?

352
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:28,800
Mom's only going to get worse.

353
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:32,332
They say mental
exercise is good,

354
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:33,986
that's why I got her
that gardening book.

355
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:37,308
Does growing cucumbers
count as mental exercise?

356
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:39,310
I hate when you do that.

357
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,437
What?

358
00:17:41,521 --> 00:17:43,689
You share your condescending
opinion as a question

359
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:45,525
trying to disguise
the condescension.

360
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:46,859
Why don't you just say

361
00:17:46,943 --> 00:17:48,253
that you think that
gardening is idiotic?

362
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,357
- Uh, because that's not what I was doing.
- Bullshit.

363
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:51,989
Bullshit. Bullshit.

364
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,161
Maybe we can hire a
nurse a few times a week.

365
00:17:57,245 --> 00:17:58,263
Who's going to pay for that?

366
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,872
You... you can't afford it?

367
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:02,458
Not after the divorce, I cannot.

368
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:05,753
Well, it will hurt,

369
00:18:05,837 --> 00:18:07,922
but we'll probably have
to sell the beach house.

370
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,591
Yeah, we definitely need
to sell the beach house,

371
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:11,968
but that money is going to go

372
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:13,886
to pay back the reverse mortgage

373
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,055
that our mother took
out on the other house.

374
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:18,933
Yeah.

375
00:18:22,103 --> 00:18:23,288
Look, I can send
some money home,

376
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:24,456
but it's not going to be much.

377
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,731
Can't Cliff chip in?

378
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:27,275
Cliff's not in a
good place, okay?

379
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:28,943
Who is? Okay?

380
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,487
Monk, Becca took everything.

381
00:18:31,571 --> 00:18:34,282
And the kids are getting
teased at school.

382
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:35,533
- I didn't know.
- Well...

383
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:37,535
Maybe you should call him.

384
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,293
I'm sorry I've always
been so distant.

385
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,758
You couldn't help that.

386
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:54,427
You were always Dad's favorite.

387
00:18:56,846 --> 00:18:58,306
And that made Cliff and I bond,

388
00:18:58,389 --> 00:18:59,515
and you resented us

389
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,851
for having that
bond, and then...

390
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,769
{\an8}I don't know, you just
became self-sufficient.

391
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:07,916
You never talked about this.

392
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,525
We never talked about anything.

393
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:13,195
Is that surprising?

394
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,739
Look at our parents.

395
00:19:15,448 --> 00:19:16,782
Mm-hm.

396
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:19,911
The only emotions
I remember from Dad

397
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,707
were boredom and rage.

398
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:26,709
Is boredom an emotion?

399
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,004
Great. It's
Detective Dictionary.

400
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:32,381
Oh!

401
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:33,942
You haven't called
me that in forever.

402
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,343
Oh, God!

403
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:38,429
- What? Oh, come on!
- Oh, God!

404
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,601
Lisa? You okay? Hey.

405
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,189
Hey, help! Help!

406
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,457
"If you are reading this

407
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,794
it's because I,
Lisa Magical Ellison

408
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:54,380
have died.

409
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,343
Obviously, this is not ideal,

410
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:02,888
but I guess it had to
happen at some point.

411
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:06,350
Hopefully, I...

412
00:21:09,145 --> 00:21:11,814
Hopefully, I expired

413
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:16,360
under the heaving thrusts
of a sweaty Idris Elba

414
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:19,155
or perhaps in a less
dignified manner,

415
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:22,950
"under the heaving thrusts
of a sweaty Russell Crowe."

416
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:26,245
"Irrespective of how I went,

417
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:29,040
I ask that those closest to me

418
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,585
not mourn all that much.

419
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:35,755
I lived a life
that made me proud.

420
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:37,965
I...

421
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,259
I was loved,

422
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:43,429
and I loved in return.

423
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:48,225
I found work that
aroused my passions.

424
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:51,020
I believe I gave
more than I took.

425
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:53,647
And I did my damnedest
to help people in need.

426
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:56,567
And on top of all that,

427
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,779
many a friend wrongly
accused me of having Botox

428
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:02,948
because of how tight my skin
stayed well into my 50's.

429
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:06,243
What more could
someone ask of a life?

430
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:09,288
I love you all.

431
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,249
Thank you for being here today.

432
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,378
Goodbye.

433
00:22:18,464 --> 00:22:19,632
"Lisa."

434
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:26,889
Cliff?

435
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:54,208
Are those human remains?

436
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:56,627
You guys have a permit for that?

437
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,379
Just shut the fuck up, Phillip.

438
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,172
Cliff, you don't
talk to me like that.

439
00:23:00,256 --> 00:23:01,507
Fuck you. I just did.

440
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,859
- What?
- You want me to beat your ass?

441
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:04,194
- I'm just...
- Get the fuck out of here.

442
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:06,137
I will eat your sweater
vest for dinner.

443
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,721
- No... Yep.
- Bitch. Go. One.

444
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:09,116
Get the fuck out
of here, Phillip.

445
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,558
- I'm just...
- Two.

446
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:12,518
- Three.
- Always been a fucking douche.

447
00:23:31,787 --> 00:23:32,913
Where is everybody?

448
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:35,457
They're exhausted.

449
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,626
I gave Lorraine something
to help her sleep.

450
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,836
Mother's taking a bath.

451
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,119
Then I'm going to dose her too.

452
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:44,592
You think maybe I can get
some of that later tonight?

453
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:46,468
Yeah. What, you're
not sleeping well?

454
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:48,762
Uh...

455
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:51,182
Normally, I sleep
fine, but just lately.

456
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:54,810
Yeah.

457
00:23:54,894 --> 00:23:57,855
Does seeing a dead body
ever become normal?

458
00:23:57,938 --> 00:23:59,481
I don't know. I
haven't seen many.

459
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:00,691
Really?

460
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:02,401
I'm a plastic surgeon.

461
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,765
If I'm looking at a corpse,
then something went very awry.

462
00:24:06,197 --> 00:24:07,198
Right.

463
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,285
Yeah. Made me feel for Mother.

464
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:15,706
Can't imagine what she must've
gone through finding Dad

465
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,251
you know, like that.

466
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:20,336
I know.

467
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:23,130
So much death.

468
00:24:31,222 --> 00:24:33,682
When was the last time
we were here together?

469
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:36,644
Uh...

470
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:38,187
Maybe ten years.

471
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,480
Yeah.

472
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:40,731
The kids were still little.

473
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:42,566
Yeah.

474
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:47,196
How is your family, by the way?

475
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:50,199
You actually care?

476
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:52,910
Of course. Why would I ask?
Why would you ask me that?

477
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:54,713
I don't know, Monk. You
never really called.

478
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:56,705
- I get busy.
- Yeah, everybody gets busy.

479
00:24:57,665 --> 00:24:58,874
You drift away.

480
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,503
You want to know
how my family is?

481
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:05,297
My wife left me 'cause she
caught me in bed with a man.

482
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,509
She took my house,
half my practice.

483
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:11,053
My kids fucking hate me.

484
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:14,098
And I still live
in fucking Tucson.

485
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:17,810
What was wrong with Tucson?

486
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,561
Oh, my God. There's one gay bar

487
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:20,938
and it's full of college kids.

488
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:23,065
One of them asked me
if I was Tyler Perry.

489
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,276
That's terrible.

490
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,736
I mean, Tyler Perry
lives in Atlanta, right?

491
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,238
Fuck you, man.

492
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:32,074
Shut up.

493
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:33,158
Nowhere near Tucson.

494
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,369
Oh, boy.

495
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:39,707
Did you know Dad had affairs?

496
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,250
Oh, for sure.

497
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,543
How?

498
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:45,462
You could just tell.

499
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:48,382
Lisa told me she saw him
kissing a white woman once.

500
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:52,011
Why did I have no idea?
Why am I the last to know?

501
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:54,179
Because you loved him too much.

502
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:56,557
Enemies see each other
better than friends.

503
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,645
What the hell did you give her?

504
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:04,273
It's oxycodone. But
knocks them right out.

505
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:05,858
You gave her opioids to sleep?

506
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:07,776
Yeah. You ever seen
a heroin addict?

507
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,194
Those guys take
naps standing up.

508
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:10,404
It's dangerous.

509
00:26:10,738 --> 00:26:12,132
Look, I'm keeping an eye
on her. I'm a doctor.

510
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:13,324
- So am I.
- Right.

511
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:15,617
Maybe if we need to
revive a sentence.

512
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:20,998
Well, why do you have
synthetic smack anyway?

513
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:26,378
What is that?

514
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:33,677
Oh.

515
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:36,972
Oh, shit.

516
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:39,850
Mother?

517
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:43,270
Mother?

518
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,277
Hey.

519
00:26:50,361 --> 00:26:53,113
Hey. What are you doing? Hey.

520
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:55,949
Mother.

521
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:58,660
Hey.

522
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:06,794
{\an8}Come on.

523
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:10,255
Come on.

524
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:14,134
Well, I'm not sure,
to be honest with you.

525
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:15,978
It's going to depend on
what the doctors say.

526
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,764
Yeah, I'll touch base
when I know more.

527
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:21,642
Thanks so much for
being understanding.

528
00:27:23,811 --> 00:27:27,314
Hey, um, Leo, one more thing.

529
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:29,191
I was wondering if maybe
we could treat this

530
00:27:29,274 --> 00:27:31,944
as a sabbatical as opposed
to a leave of absence?

531
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,171
Whatever happens with my mother,

532
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:34,395
it's going to cost some money.

533
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,450
No, I understand.

534
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:40,369
No, it's not your fault.

535
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:42,538
I'll figure something out.

536
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,331
Yeah.

537
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:45,957
Thanks for your help.

538
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,543
Okay. Bye-bye.

539
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:50,378
Oh.

540
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:55,342
Oh.

541
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:56,927
Uh...

542
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,137
You don't have to do that.

543
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,596
Oh, no. I do.

544
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,491
It's tomato season. You
can't let them go to waste.

545
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:03,225
- Ooh.
- A crime around here.

546
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:06,687
Thank you.

547
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,230
That's what neighbors
are for, right?

548
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:09,606
Welcome to the neighborhood.

549
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,734
I thought the place was vacant.

550
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:16,363
Uh, it has been for a while.

551
00:28:16,447 --> 00:28:17,948
We just got here last night.

552
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:20,659
Oh. Figured the
place was haunted.

553
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:23,704
They said some old man blew his
brains out there a while back.

554
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:27,749
Yeah.

555
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:33,088
Oh, my God. I...

556
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:36,425
I'm a fucking idiot.

557
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:38,510
Please forgive me.

558
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:39,595
Well...

559
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:42,681
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that.

560
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:44,637
What'd she do for a living?

561
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,103
She was a doctor. Um...

562
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:52,399
Most of my family, doctors.
Basically, I'm the outcast.

563
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:56,361
Um, what do you do for work?

564
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:57,445
I'm a lawyer.

565
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,823
Public defense. Quincy.

566
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:01,950
Very honorable.

567
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:05,871
Yeah. It's very hard,
but can be rewarding.

568
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:08,707
May I ask you something

569
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,168
that I'm sure a lot
of people ask you?

570
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:13,629
How do I feel about
defending guilty people?

571
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:15,171
Yeah.

572
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:17,424
- I love it.
- Why?

573
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:20,469
I have to. And
they're all guilty.

574
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:23,555
- Really?
- Yes. But that's okay.

575
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:25,557
People are more than
their worst deed.

576
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:28,894
I guess I agree with that.

577
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:31,104
Mm. Sure you do.

578
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:32,397
You're a writer.

579
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:34,024
I don't follow.

580
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:36,818
Well, writers have
to be non-judgmental.

581
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:39,071
You can't write
interesting characters

582
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:41,448
and be critical of every
bad decision they make.

583
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:42,532
Right?

584
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:43,760
Maybe you should be the writer.

585
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:45,224
I don't feel like
much of one lately.

586
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:46,912
You blocked?

587
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,666
It's just...

588
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:53,168
I don't think anybody
wants to buy what I write.

589
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:54,336
That's not true.

590
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,129
I didn't want to say anything,

591
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,298
but, um, I actually
read one of your books.

592
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:01,093
Hm. Which?

593
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:02,469
<i>The Frogs.</i>

594
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:03,553
Oh, so you were the one.

595
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,222
I liked it.

596
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:07,975
You're talented.

597
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:16,775
You're expecting company?

598
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:19,403
Yeah.

599
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,321
Oh.

600
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:30,747
Hello.

601
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,959
- Hey.
- Jelani, uh, this is Monk.

602
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,503
He and his family own the
house across the street.

603
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:37,754
Nice to meet you.

604
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:39,631
Yeah, it's a pleasure.

605
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:40,795
Are you staying for dinner?

606
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:42,426
Uh...

607
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:44,177
No, I need to go
check in on my mother.

608
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:45,387
Cool.

609
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:47,139
Thank you, uh...

610
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:52,311
For the wine, and

611
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:54,605
good night.

612
00:30:57,316 --> 00:30:58,317
Good night, Monk.

613
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,453
What time's your flight?

614
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:52,621
11:00.

615
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:57,542
You think, uh, maybe
you could change it?

616
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:59,020
Think it would be
useful to have you

617
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,396
at Mother's doctor's
appointment today.

618
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,588
I can't. I got to get home.

619
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,634
Fine, but you think
you can chip in

620
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:07,236
for her care once we
find out what's what?

621
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,613
It's probably going to
be pretty expensive.

622
00:32:08,637 --> 00:32:10,722
Things are tight
right now, so...

623
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:12,140
You thought about
firing Lorraine?

624
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:16,728
Lorraine is family.

625
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:18,814
Well, shit, Monk.

626
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:20,291
I don't know what to
tell you, all right?

627
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:21,525
So you can't do anything?

628
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,402
I will check with my accountant

629
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:24,778
when I get back, all right?

630
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,780
It's 8:00 in the morning.

631
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:28,824
I'm not flying the
fucking plane, Monk.

632
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:36,915
Well, do you think
you could be so kind

633
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,500
as to go inside and see

634
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,001
if Mother is ready to head out?

635
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:41,253
All right. Hey.

636
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:42,629
- Mother!
- Don't yell, man.

637
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:43,714
Be civilized.

638
00:32:43,797 --> 00:32:45,799
You're just like our dad, man.

639
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:48,135
So you do right by me, Monk.
I swear to fucking God.

640
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,096
Clown.

641
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,264
You want to see civilized?

642
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:53,932
Mother!

643
00:32:58,103 --> 00:32:59,104
Morning.

644
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:02,482
Hey. Morning.

645
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:05,152
Listen

646
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:07,028
- about last night, uh...
- Oh.

647
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:08,321
It's okay.

648
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,615
You don't have to explain.
I had a good time.

649
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:11,742
No, I...

650
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:15,996
Jelani, he's my ex.

651
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,205
Well, he's going to be.

652
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:20,625
We're in the middle
of breaking up and

653
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:22,669
it's hard.

654
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:25,213
I get it.

655
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:27,546
I'd like to see you again.

656
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:30,802
Do you think that you'll be

657
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:31,946
around town next couple of days?

658
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,556
You know, grab a drink?

659
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:37,017
Yeah, I'd like that.

660
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:40,312
Yeah, me too.

661
00:33:42,647 --> 00:33:43,648
Drive safe.

662
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:45,776
Thanks.

663
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:12,010
Mr. Ellison?

664
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:14,179
We're ready.

665
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,768
<i>Her MRI shows</i>

666
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:22,270
early signs of
neurodegeneration.

667
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:24,314
There's a slight decrease

668
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:26,149
in the size of the temporal lobe

669
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:27,734
which suggest Alzheimer's.

670
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:31,738
I'm very sorry, Mr. Ellison.

671
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:33,156
But at some point,

672
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,575
she'll probably require
around-the-clock care

673
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:38,119
for her own safety.

674
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,770
- Hey, young nigga.
- Hey!

675
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:48,148
Hey, whoa, whoa.

676
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:49,900
Don't shoot me,
partner. Come on now.

677
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:55,572
Van Go.

678
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:57,532
That you?

679
00:35:57,616 --> 00:35:58,617
Yeah, me, nigga.

680
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:01,953
Shit. What, you
drunk, motherfucker?

681
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,664
Where you running to?

682
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:07,751
Just leave me alone, man.

683
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:12,005
How your mama?

684
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:14,548
What you say?

685
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:16,509
I said, how your mama?

686
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,097
Oh, shit.

687
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:23,308
They ain't tell you, huh?

688
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:25,344
What you talking about, punk?

689
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:27,228
Hey, what you talking about?

690
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:30,732
Think about it, Van Go.

691
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:33,151
Look at my face.

692
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:37,280
Look at my midnight
black complex...

693
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:38,740
No, that's not right.

694
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:41,284
What did you want to say?

695
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:44,829
You can say it better
than that, right?

696
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:45,953
Come on. What do you want?

697
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:51,670
Think about it, Van Go.

698
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:54,214
Look at my face.

699
00:36:55,173 --> 00:36:57,634
Look at my coal black skin.

700
00:36:57,717 --> 00:36:58,885
And then look at your own.

701
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:03,306
Look at my black eyes.

702
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,391
Now look at your own.

703
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:07,936
Look at my big black lips.

704
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:09,813
Now look at your own.

705
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:12,871
I's your daddy whether
you like it or not.

706
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:15,402
Shut up, okay? Shut
up, man! You lying!

707
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:17,278
No, no, that's the truth, nigga.

708
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,573
So, where you been, huh?

709
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:22,409
Where you been?

710
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:24,077
I've been where I always be.

711
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:26,204
Surviving.

712
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:29,124
You ain't worth a piss.

713
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:30,709
Your mama ain't worth a piss.

714
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,460
So here I am.

715
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:43,304
What do I say now?

716
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:46,725
I think now will come
some sort of, you know,

717
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:48,601
dumb, melodramatic sob story

718
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:50,937
where you, uh, highlight
your broken interiority.

719
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:53,314
Something... something
like, um, I don't know...

720
00:37:58,611 --> 00:37:59,988
I hates this man.

721
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:02,824
I hates my mama.

722
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:04,117
And I hates myself.

723
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:09,330
I've seen my face in his.

724
00:38:10,957 --> 00:38:12,517
I see the ape that
all them stupid girls

725
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:14,627
were afraid of, yeah.

726
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:16,546
I can see my long
arms hanging down.

727
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,090
And I see eyes that don't care

728
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:20,759
what happens tomorrow.

729
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:26,097
I see myself

730
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:28,058
rocking back on my heels,

731
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:29,142
just like this, baby.

732
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:31,311
Just waiting.

733
00:38:31,394 --> 00:38:33,438
And waiting, and
waiting, and waiting,

734
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:34,981
and waiting for something

735
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:37,233
that I'm not even going to
recognize when it comes!

736
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:39,861
Death is my only cure.

737
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:42,030
I heard that before.

738
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:46,076
I've been hearing it,
and I'm hearing it now.

739
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:50,038
I see...

740
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,542
I see my mama crying.

741
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:58,546
I see her screaming
in my dreams.

742
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,881
I see my babies.

743
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:01,716
I see my...

744
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:03,426
I see my daddy.

745
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:07,222
I see myself.

746
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:10,767
What the fuck?

747
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:15,396
What the fuck you do that for?

748
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,773
Because you ain't shit, nigga.

749
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:20,860
And you made me.

750
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:25,824
So because you ain't
shit, I ain't shit.

751
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:30,120
Because you ain't
shit, I ain't shit.

752
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:38,503
I gots to bounce.

753
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,717
Peace, motherfucker.

754
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:47,053
Peace.

755
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,516
What the fuck was that for?

756
00:39:56,646 --> 00:39:57,689
<i>You're watching.</i>

757
00:39:57,772 --> 00:40:01,192
<i>Black Stories Month on WHN.</i>

758
00:40:03,528 --> 00:40:05,029

00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:06,473
<i>of the African-American

<i>heartbreak, and drama.</i>

762
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:13,329
<i>Mama!</i>

763
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:16,749
Hello?

764
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:19,210
"I be standing
outside in the night,

765
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:20,837
a police chopper go by

766
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,755
and shine some lights
in some backyards

767
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:26,551
and I think, 'Shine that
light on me, motherfucker,

768
00:40:26,634 --> 00:40:28,303
<i>shine me some fucking light</i>

769
00:40:28,386 --> 00:40:30,805
"so I can see where
the fuck I be at.'"

770
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:32,891
<i>Are you serious?</i>

771
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:34,285
You notice I didn't
put my name on it.

772
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:35,727
<i>Yes, Stagg R. Leigh,</i>

773
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,645
I did notice that. Well done.

774
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:39,105
But I still can't send this out.

775
00:40:39,189 --> 00:40:40,429
You said you wanted Black stuff.

776
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:41,816
What's Blacker than that?

777
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,693
It's got deadbeat dads,

778
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,861
rappers, crack,

779
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:46,905
and he gets killed
by a cop in the end.

780
00:40:46,988 --> 00:40:50,158
I mean, that's... that's...
that's Black, right?

781
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:52,577
I see what you're doing.

782
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:54,412
<i>Good, because it's not subtle.</i>

783
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:55,890
I mean, how's that
book so different

784
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:57,183
than some of the other
garbage they put out?

785
00:40:57,207 --> 00:40:58,041
That's not the point.

786
00:40:58,124 --> 00:40:59,375
Well, it's my point.

787
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:01,377
Look at what they publish.

788
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:02,901
Look at what they
expect us to write.

789
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:04,631
I'm sick of it.

790
00:41:04,714 --> 00:41:07,926
And that's an expression
of how sick I am.

791
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:09,594
<i>Monk, I'm trying to sell books,</i>

792
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:11,095
<i>not be a part of some crusade.</i>

793
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:13,708
Who do you expect
to publish this?

794
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:15,433
No one.

795
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:17,916
I just want to rub their noses
in the horseshit they solicit.

796
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:20,271
Okay.

797
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:21,522
What do you want me to do?

798
00:41:21,606 --> 00:41:22,857
<i>I want you to send it out.</i>

799
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:24,359
Can I say it's performance art?

800
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:26,736
No. Send it straight.

801
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:29,030
If they can't take the
joke, then fuck them.

802
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:32,116
All right, but I'm
only sending it

803
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,920
to a couple of places.
This thing scares me.

804
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:35,453
<i>Scares you? Why?</i>

805
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:36,829
Because white people think

806
00:41:36,913 --> 00:41:38,748
they want the truth,
but they don't.

807
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:41,000
They just want to feel absolved.

808
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:43,670
Well, fortunately,
that's not my problem.

809
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,130
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Bye.

810
00:42:07,652 --> 00:42:08,852
I'm surprised you reached out.

811
00:42:08,903 --> 00:42:10,947
I thought you were
just being nice.

812
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,075
Oh, I'm never just being
nice. I'm too old for that.

813
00:42:14,158 --> 00:42:15,910
You know, I like you
so much, in fact,

814
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:17,954
that I went out and got
another one of your books.

815
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,290
Really? Which one?

816
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:21,374
<i>The Haas Conundrum.</i>

817
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:23,626
What'd you think?

818
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:25,670
I liked it.

819
00:42:26,671 --> 00:42:29,424
Susan has really great dialogue.

820
00:42:29,507 --> 00:42:31,968
And I love the aunt.

821
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:33,970
Wow. I mean, you
write women well.

822
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:36,139
Oh, you think so?

823
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:37,582
Yeah. They're not
hothouse flowers.

824
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,641
Thank you.

825
00:42:40,351 --> 00:42:42,729
- I appreciate that.
- Mm.

826
00:42:42,812 --> 00:42:44,772
I could've done with
less footnotes though.

827
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:53,698
I, uh...

828
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:54,866
I got to run.

829
00:42:57,076 --> 00:42:58,411
Well, how's your mom?

830
00:42:59,495 --> 00:43:01,497
In and out.

831
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:03,333
I'm afraid to be
away for too long.

832
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:05,793
- Yeah.
- But, uh...

833
00:43:08,212 --> 00:43:09,255
I'll, uh...

834
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:12,258
I'll call you.

835
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:15,345
Hold on a minute.

836
00:43:21,684 --> 00:43:22,684
Sign my book.

837
00:43:33,738 --> 00:43:34,739
What's your name again?

838
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,741
Hm.

839
00:44:21,244 --> 00:44:22,245
Mr. Monk?

840
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:28,543
What's going on with the lights?

841
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,421
Miss Lisa used to pay the bill.

842
00:44:32,547 --> 00:44:33,548
Did you?

843
00:44:38,678 --> 00:44:39,846
How much?

844
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:41,139
<i>Well, I can handle</i>

845
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:42,598
the electrical bills,

846
00:44:42,682 --> 00:44:44,308
but these care
facilities are expensive.

847
00:44:45,268 --> 00:44:46,727
<i>The best one nearby</i>

848
00:44:46,811 --> 00:44:51,399
is $5,600 a month, and
that's for a shared room.

849
00:44:51,482 --> 00:44:54,444
It goes up to $6,900 a
month for a private room.

850
00:44:54,527 --> 00:44:55,796
Well, why you looking
at the best one?

851
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,238
She wasn't the best mother.

852
00:44:57,321 --> 00:44:59,049
Look, I'm not here to
re-litigate our childhoods.

853
00:44:59,073 --> 00:45:00,950
Of course not, because
yours was great.

854
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:03,870
<i>Goddamn it! Are you
going to help me or not?</i>

855
00:45:03,953 --> 00:45:05,872
Won't Medicaid cover
it or something?

856
00:45:05,955 --> 00:45:07,999
That's not how it works.
You don't know this?

857
00:45:08,082 --> 00:45:09,542
Oh. Hello.

858
00:45:12,253 --> 00:45:14,088
<i>Who's that? What are you doing?</i>

859
00:45:14,172 --> 00:45:15,798
I've taken a lover.

860
00:45:15,882 --> 00:45:17,008
You've taken a lover?

861
00:45:17,216 --> 00:45:18,736
You got a problem
with that, homophobe?

862
00:45:18,926 --> 00:45:21,207
Listen, I'm not offended that
you've taken a lover, Cliff.

863
00:45:21,762 --> 00:45:22,763
I'm offended, Cliff,

864
00:45:22,847 --> 00:45:25,057
that you call it taking a lover.

865
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:27,018
Mm, you can eat shit, nigga.

866
00:45:27,101 --> 00:45:29,437
I'll take my lover right now.

867
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,897
Hey, where you going?

868
00:45:49,373 --> 00:45:50,374
There you are.

869
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:52,210
Traffic was insane. What's up?

870
00:45:52,835 --> 00:45:53,836
Sit down.

871
00:45:58,549 --> 00:45:59,550
Have a seat.

872
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:05,556
We sold your book.

873
00:46:08,434 --> 00:46:10,520
Holy shit!

874
00:46:10,603 --> 00:46:12,980
- I thought it was DOA.
- Not <i>The Persians.</i>

875
00:46:16,275 --> 00:46:17,151
No.

876
00:46:17,235 --> 00:46:19,779
Get out!

877
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:21,781
Paula Betaman from
Thompson-Watt.

878
00:46:21,864 --> 00:46:23,199
She always passes.

879
00:46:23,282 --> 00:46:27,912
Not this time. They want
to preempt for $750,000.

880
00:46:27,995 --> 00:46:30,373
No one's ever offered
that much to me.

881
00:46:30,456 --> 00:46:32,542
- This is you.
- No, it's not, Arthur.

882
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:34,293
- You wrote it.
- As a joke.

883
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:36,170
Well, now it's the
most lucrative joke

884
00:46:36,254 --> 00:46:37,338
you've ever told.

885
00:46:37,547 --> 00:46:39,090
- And I'm not selling.
- Why not?

886
00:46:39,173 --> 00:46:41,384
Because it's trash, Arthur.

887
00:46:41,467 --> 00:46:44,053
You didn't even want to
send it out the other day.

888
00:46:44,136 --> 00:46:47,765
Oh, but look who's suddenly
overcome his fears.

889
00:46:47,848 --> 00:46:49,976
I know, I broke the
first rule of sales.

890
00:46:50,059 --> 00:46:52,270
Never underestimate
how stupid everyone is.

891
00:46:52,353 --> 00:46:55,982
Well, I'm not participating
in making them any stupider.

892
00:46:56,065 --> 00:46:57,733
Well, you haven't thus far,

893
00:46:57,817 --> 00:47:00,570
which is admirable, but

894
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:03,072
you also haven't made any money.

895
00:47:06,492 --> 00:47:08,369
Doesn't your mom
need help these days?

896
00:47:11,539 --> 00:47:12,539
Check this out.

897
00:47:16,544 --> 00:47:18,796
I don't care how drunk we
get, I'm not selling it.

898
00:47:18,879 --> 00:47:20,172
That's not what I'm doing.

899
00:47:22,717 --> 00:47:25,386
Johnnie Walker Red, 24 bucks.

900
00:47:25,469 --> 00:47:27,722
Johnnie Walker Black, 50 bucks.

901
00:47:28,556 --> 00:47:30,057
Johnnie Walker Blue

902
00:47:31,183 --> 00:47:33,185
$160.

903
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:34,270
You see the metaphor?

904
00:47:35,688 --> 00:47:36,897
No.

905
00:47:36,981 --> 00:47:39,400
These are all made
by the same company.

906
00:47:39,483 --> 00:47:41,944
The Red is shit, the
Black is less shit,

907
00:47:42,028 --> 00:47:43,696
the Blue is good.

908
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:46,532
But fewer people buy the
blue because it's expensive.

909
00:47:46,616 --> 00:47:47,742
And at the end of the day,

910
00:47:47,825 --> 00:47:49,185
most people just
want to get drunk.

911
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:53,122
For most of your career,
your books have been Blue.

912
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:56,000
They're good, complex.

913
00:47:56,751 --> 00:47:58,002
But they're not popular

914
00:47:58,085 --> 00:48:01,339
because most people
want something easy.

915
00:48:01,422 --> 00:48:05,635
Now, for the first time ever,
you've written a Red book.

916
00:48:05,718 --> 00:48:07,011
It's simple, prurient.

917
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:08,596
It's not great literature, but

918
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:11,432
satisfies an urge.

919
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:15,186
And that's valuable.

920
00:48:15,269 --> 00:48:17,229
What I'm trying to
illustrate is that,

921
00:48:17,313 --> 00:48:19,357
just because you do Red

922
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,234
doesn't mean you
can't also do Blue.

923
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:23,319
You can do it all.

924
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,780
Like Johnnie Walker.

925
00:48:25,863 --> 00:48:28,449
In fact, you got Johnnie
Walker beat, because

926
00:48:28,532 --> 00:48:30,412
you don't even have to
put your real name on it.

927
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,751
Jesus.

928
00:48:40,378 --> 00:48:41,712
Do we drink now?

929
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:47,843
<i>Hello?</i>

930
00:48:47,927 --> 00:48:49,136
Hello, Paula.

931
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,972
Arthur! So wonderful
to hear from you.

932
00:48:52,056 --> 00:48:55,643
Um, I hope that you are
with the man of the hour.

933
00:48:55,726 --> 00:48:57,895
I am, indeed. He's
right here next to me.

934
00:48:57,978 --> 00:48:59,605
Mr. Leigh?

935
00:48:59,689 --> 00:49:00,940
<i>Uh, yeah, this is he.</i>

936
00:49:02,066 --> 00:49:03,067
Oh, really?

937
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:12,034
Uh...

938
00:49:12,493 --> 00:49:14,829
Yeah, goddamn it.

939
00:49:14,912 --> 00:49:17,164
- Right. Right. Okay.
- <i>Motherfucker.</i>

940
00:49:17,248 --> 00:49:20,126
Yeah, I was a little
confused at first, but...

941
00:49:20,209 --> 00:49:23,087
We're both very excited to
discuss Thompson-Watt's offer.

942
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,606
Yes, well, first of
all, let me just say

943
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:26,024
that all of us here
at Thompson-Watt

944
00:49:26,048 --> 00:49:28,551
are thrilled with <i>My Pafology.</i>

945
00:49:28,634 --> 00:49:30,720
It is about as perfect a book

946
00:49:30,803 --> 00:49:32,805
as I have seen in
a long, long while.

947
00:49:32,888 --> 00:49:36,892
<i>Just... just raw and real.</i>

948
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:40,271
And, Mr. Leigh, is this
based on your actual life?

949
00:49:42,356 --> 00:49:44,692
Yeah, you think some
bitch-ass college boy

950
00:49:44,775 --> 00:49:45,985
can come up with that shit?

951
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:47,069
No, no. No, I don't.

952
00:49:47,945 --> 00:49:50,156
No. You know, that kind of

953
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:54,076
visceral energy cannot
be taught, right?

954
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,996
Stagg... May I call you...
Now, is Stagg a pseudonym?

955
00:49:58,456 --> 00:50:00,750
Yes, uh, it is.

956
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,960
Mr. Leigh can't
use his real name

957
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:05,004
because he's a...

958
00:50:06,005 --> 00:50:08,048
Well, he's a wanted fugitive.

959
00:50:08,132 --> 00:50:10,301
<i>Oh, my God. Wow.</i>

960
00:50:10,384 --> 00:50:12,887
That's why this couldn't
be a video conference.

961
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,097
Are you crazy? What if
they fact check this?

962
00:50:15,181 --> 00:50:17,341
I checked. There's barely
money to pay editors anymore.

963
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:19,185
Just go with it.

964
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:26,817
Yeah, I did a 12-year
bid, but no going back.

965
00:50:28,027 --> 00:50:29,236
Know what I mean?

966
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,489
Yeah. Yeah, you know, um...

967
00:50:32,323 --> 00:50:34,033
I've been reading a lot

968
00:50:34,116 --> 00:50:36,035
about the prison
abolition movement...

969
00:50:36,118 --> 00:50:37,578
- Oh, God!
- <i>I've...</i>

970
00:50:37,661 --> 00:50:39,663
Sorry to rush, Paula,
but can we talk business?

971
00:50:39,747 --> 00:50:42,166
Mr. Leigh values his
time outside of a cell.

972
00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:43,375
<i>Of course.</i>

973
00:50:43,459 --> 00:50:44,859
I'm sure you're
both very, very busy

974
00:50:44,919 --> 00:50:46,462
so I will get right to it.

975
00:50:46,545 --> 00:50:48,964
Um, you'll notice
that our offer is

976
00:50:50,299 --> 00:50:51,717
unusually large

977
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:54,762
<i>and that is because we believe</i>

978
00:50:54,845 --> 00:50:57,139
Mr. Leigh has
written a bestseller.

979
00:50:57,223 --> 00:50:59,350
We think it is going to
be the read of the summer.

980
00:51:00,017 --> 00:51:01,727
Yeah, I'm sure

981
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:05,648
white people on the
Hamptons will delight in it.

982
00:51:05,731 --> 00:51:06,982
<i>Yes, we will.</i>

983
00:51:07,066 --> 00:51:10,486
They... We... It's
going to be huge. Huge.

984
00:51:11,362 --> 00:51:12,363
<i>I love it.</i>

985
00:51:21,747 --> 00:51:23,833
Is that little
Thelonious Ellison?

986
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,837
My God! Maynard!

987
00:51:30,756 --> 00:51:32,967
Everyone still call you Monk?

988
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:34,093
Well,

989
00:51:34,176 --> 00:51:35,511
everyone but you.

990
00:51:35,594 --> 00:51:38,013
Well, it's a beautiful name.

991
00:51:38,097 --> 00:51:41,016
It seems simple not
to use it whole.

992
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,060
Well, I'm glad someone
appreciates it.

993
00:51:44,603 --> 00:51:47,690
I heard about your
sister. My condolences.

994
00:51:47,773 --> 00:51:48,774
Thank you.

995
00:51:49,942 --> 00:51:51,443
I don't think I've
seen you since

996
00:51:52,403 --> 00:51:53,904
before your father passed?

997
00:51:53,988 --> 00:51:56,156
Yeah, it's been a
while. I live in LA now.

998
00:51:56,907 --> 00:51:58,450
Oh! Hollywood.

999
00:51:58,534 --> 00:52:00,703
Hey, do you write for that <i>NCIS?</i>

1000
00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:03,163
Just books.

1001
00:52:03,247 --> 00:52:06,375
Well, you should try to
write for <i>NCIS.</i> It's popular.

1002
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:08,419
Well, maybe I will.

1003
00:52:08,502 --> 00:52:10,421
Hey, so, how you been?

1004
00:52:10,504 --> 00:52:12,214
Oh, I'm good. And you?

1005
00:52:12,298 --> 00:52:13,382
- Yeah...
- Mr. Monk.

1006
00:52:13,465 --> 00:52:15,050
What would you like for dinner?

1007
00:52:17,928 --> 00:52:19,013
Maynard!

1008
00:52:19,096 --> 00:52:20,139
Hi, Lorraine.

1009
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:22,516
It's been a dog's age.

1010
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:24,727
Well, I guess it has.

1011
00:52:27,021 --> 00:52:28,188
You look well.

1012
00:52:29,523 --> 00:52:30,900
You too.

1013
00:52:33,986 --> 00:52:35,613
Well, I best be getting back.

1014
00:52:35,696 --> 00:52:37,364
It's good to see
you, Thelonious.

1015
00:52:37,448 --> 00:52:38,449
You too.

1016
00:52:41,076 --> 00:52:42,077
Lorraine.

1017
00:52:45,789 --> 00:52:46,957
Mm, mm, mm.

1018
00:52:56,675 --> 00:52:57,801
Ain't nothing to smile at.

1019
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:02,932
Oh! There she is.

1020
00:53:03,015 --> 00:53:04,224
Behave yourself.

1021
00:53:11,649 --> 00:53:13,525
Hey. Hi.

1022
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:17,488
- Got this for you.
- Oh, thank you.

1023
00:53:17,571 --> 00:53:19,990
- Lorraine, this is Coraline.
- Oh.

1024
00:53:20,074 --> 00:53:21,367
- Hey.
- Welcome.

1025
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:22,493
- Yeah, hello.
- Hello.

1026
00:53:22,576 --> 00:53:23,619
Mother, perfect timing.

1027
00:53:23,702 --> 00:53:25,162
This is Coraline.

1028
00:53:25,245 --> 00:53:27,456
Hello, dear, I'm Agnes.

1029
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:29,625
Such a pleasure to meet
you. I brought you these.

1030
00:53:29,708 --> 00:53:32,544
Dahlias are my favorite.

1031
00:53:32,628 --> 00:53:34,213
There's a whole
world inside them.

1032
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:41,845
- Lorraine?
- Yes.

1033
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:46,100
Mother, you sit here.

1034
00:53:48,018 --> 00:53:49,478
All right.

1035
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:52,314
And, Coraline, why don't
you sit across from Mother?

1036
00:53:52,398 --> 00:53:53,524
Oh, sure, sure.

1037
00:53:59,989 --> 00:54:01,448
Okay.

1038
00:54:03,701 --> 00:54:05,285
I'm happy you're not white.

1039
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:07,329
Me too.

1040
00:54:20,217 --> 00:54:21,719
Yeah, it was pretty funny.

1041
00:54:22,928 --> 00:54:24,304
Well, I think you...

1042
00:54:25,472 --> 00:54:27,558
I think you remind
her of my sister.

1043
00:54:28,434 --> 00:54:29,435
Mm.

1044
00:54:30,811 --> 00:54:34,273
Well, do you think
we look alike?

1045
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:36,275
No, but

1046
00:54:37,484 --> 00:54:39,194
you're both self-assured,

1047
00:54:40,404 --> 00:54:41,655
and funny,

1048
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:45,367
and you're both

1049
00:54:46,493 --> 00:54:48,704
fantastic kissers.

1050
00:54:48,787 --> 00:54:51,248
Oh. Ooh.

1051
00:55:00,466 --> 00:55:01,842
Mrs. Ellison?

1052
00:55:04,344 --> 00:55:05,804
Mrs. Ellison?

1053
00:55:08,182 --> 00:55:09,475
Mr. Monk!

1054
00:55:12,936 --> 00:55:15,731
Mr. Monk!

1055
00:55:15,814 --> 00:55:17,208
- I just... I just...
- What's wrong?

1056
00:55:17,232 --> 00:55:18,859
I just stepped
outside for a moment.

1057
00:55:18,942 --> 00:55:20,110
What's wrong?

1058
00:55:20,194 --> 00:55:21,379
Having a cup of
coffee with Maynard,

1059
00:55:21,403 --> 00:55:22,821
I was right in front.

1060
00:55:22,905 --> 00:55:23,781
Where's Mother?

1061
00:55:23,864 --> 00:55:25,032
- I don't know!
- What?

1062
00:55:25,115 --> 00:55:26,492
The backdoor was open.

1063
00:55:26,575 --> 00:55:28,160
- She gone.
- What?

1064
00:55:28,243 --> 00:55:29,787
We should split up. Here.

1065
00:55:30,788 --> 00:55:32,289
I got more in the car.

1066
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:36,376
Mother!

1067
00:55:37,586 --> 00:55:38,587
Mother!

1068
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,881
Mother!

1069
00:55:42,091 --> 00:55:43,092
Mother!

1070
00:55:47,638 --> 00:55:48,639
Mother!

1071
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:51,850
Mother.

1072
00:55:53,602 --> 00:55:55,312
Mother!

1073
00:55:57,356 --> 00:55:58,816
Mother! Hey!

1074
00:56:00,275 --> 00:56:01,735
Mother! Mother!

1075
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:04,071
Hey! Hey, stop!

1076
00:56:04,154 --> 00:56:05,823
Hey! Where are you going?

1077
00:56:05,906 --> 00:56:07,574
Lisa's out there

1078
00:56:07,658 --> 00:56:10,018
roughhousing with the cousins.
Somebody's going to get hurt.

1079
00:56:10,285 --> 00:56:11,954
Stop. Um...

1080
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:15,332
I will go tell her. Okay?

1081
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:17,584
- Yeah, but then...
- I'll take you back to the house

1082
00:56:17,668 --> 00:56:18,770
and then I will go tell her.

1083
00:56:18,794 --> 00:56:19,837
But they're out there.

1084
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,380
I know, I know.

1085
00:56:21,463 --> 00:56:23,382
- Okay, you sure?
- I will tell her.

1086
00:56:23,465 --> 00:56:24,842
- Okay.
- Now, come on.

1087
00:56:24,925 --> 00:56:26,093
It's too cold out here.

1088
00:56:26,176 --> 00:56:27,761
- You should...
- Okay.

1089
00:56:27,845 --> 00:56:29,471
Lisa doesn't swim very well.

1090
00:56:29,555 --> 00:56:31,056
I know. I know.

1091
00:56:31,807 --> 00:56:33,559
Okay. Almost there.

1092
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,561
All right.

1093
00:56:36,478 --> 00:56:37,479
Oh, good.

1094
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,773
- Good.
- Here we go.

1095
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:42,651
All right.

1096
00:56:43,402 --> 00:56:44,736
Okay, Monkie.

1097
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:45,863
All right.

1098
00:56:52,494 --> 00:56:55,038
And this is our library.

1099
00:56:55,122 --> 00:56:57,916
It's full of all the classics.
And we try to get some

1100
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,001
new releases too.

1101
00:57:02,254 --> 00:57:04,089
Do you like to
read, Mrs. Ellison?

1102
00:57:04,173 --> 00:57:05,174
No.

1103
00:57:05,591 --> 00:57:07,134
That's not true.

1104
00:57:07,217 --> 00:57:09,178
She loves to read. She
taught me to love reading.

1105
00:57:10,012 --> 00:57:11,013
Perhaps we can get

1106
00:57:11,096 --> 00:57:12,323
some of your son's
books in here.

1107
00:57:12,347 --> 00:57:13,599
And you can lead a book club.

1108
00:57:13,682 --> 00:57:14,683
Hm.

1109
00:57:18,395 --> 00:57:19,980
Sorry.

1110
00:57:20,063 --> 00:57:22,208
It's fine. It's hard for a
lot of the residents at first.

1111
00:57:22,232 --> 00:57:23,650
But she'll settle in.

1112
00:57:23,734 --> 00:57:24,860
Right.

1113
00:57:26,486 --> 00:57:28,238
I appreciate all your help,

1114
00:57:28,322 --> 00:57:30,949
but how soon do you
think we can get her in?

1115
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:32,618
Uh, in about a month.

1116
00:57:32,701 --> 00:57:34,786
You can start the paperwork
today if you'd like.

1117
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:36,580
Great. I'd like that.

1118
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,499
I'll go check on your mom, okay?

1119
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,584
Thank you.

1120
00:57:45,172 --> 00:57:47,090
- Hello?
- [Carl] <i>Hey, Thelonious.</i>

1121
00:57:47,174 --> 00:57:48,800
How you doing? My
name is Carl Brunt.

1122
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:50,677
I am the director

1123
00:57:50,761 --> 00:57:52,346
of the New England
Book Association.

1124
00:57:52,429 --> 00:57:54,932
Hi, Carl. I know who you are.

1125
00:57:55,015 --> 00:57:57,267
<i>Oh, good. Then perhaps
you'll also know</i>

1126
00:57:57,351 --> 00:57:59,353
that each year my
organization bestows

1127
00:57:59,436 --> 00:58:03,148
the somewhat pretentiously
named Literary Award.

1128
00:58:03,232 --> 00:58:06,068
Every writer knows the
Literary Award, Carl.

1129
00:58:06,151 --> 00:58:08,028
Especially those of
us who haven't won it.

1130
00:58:08,111 --> 00:58:11,156
Yeah. Yeah.

1131
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,825
Well, that's sort of
related to why I'm calling.

1132
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:15,452
Like many American institutions,

1133
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:17,287
mine was recently
rattled by the notion

1134
00:58:17,371 --> 00:58:19,122
that our lack of diversity

1135
00:58:19,206 --> 00:58:21,500
had led to a blind
spot in our work.

1136
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:24,211
So, you know, we're kind
of trying to remedy that.

1137
00:58:24,294 --> 00:58:25,396
<i>And to that end, I was wondering</i>

1138
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,797
<i>how you might feel</i>

1139
00:58:27,047 --> 00:58:29,007
<i>about being a judge in
this year's award ceremony?</i>

1140
00:58:29,925 --> 00:58:32,761
Um, let me say first,

1141
00:58:32,844 --> 00:58:35,055
<i>Carl, that I'm
honored you choose me</i>

1142
00:58:35,138 --> 00:58:37,808
out of all the Black writers
you could go to out of fear

1143
00:58:37,891 --> 00:58:39,017
of being called racist.

1144
00:58:39,101 --> 00:58:41,228
Yeah, you're very welcome.

1145
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:44,940
But I think this sounds
like a lot of work.

1146
00:58:45,023 --> 00:58:46,483
Yeah, I can't deny that.

1147
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:48,544
I mean, you're going to have
to read dozens of books.

1148
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:50,570
We could offer you
a modest stipend.

1149
00:58:51,488 --> 00:58:52,489
Even so, I'm not sure.

1150
00:58:53,115 --> 00:58:54,283
<i>Okay.</i>

1151
00:58:54,366 --> 00:58:55,784
One of the crass
perk I reference

1152
00:58:55,867 --> 00:58:57,553
when people are kind of
on the fence like this

1153
00:58:57,577 --> 00:58:59,371
is that this will allow
you the opportunity

1154
00:58:59,454 --> 00:59:01,623
to literally judge these
other writers for once,

1155
00:59:01,707 --> 00:59:02,907
rather than just figuratively.

1156
00:59:04,501 --> 00:59:05,794
All right, I'm in.

1157
00:59:05,877 --> 00:59:07,212
<i>Well, fantastic. Okay.</i>

1158
00:59:07,421 --> 00:59:09,965
Great. So you're going
to be one of five judges.

1159
00:59:10,048 --> 00:59:12,634
Uh, the only one we
have confirmed so far

1160
00:59:12,718 --> 00:59:14,011
is Sintara Golden.

1161
00:59:14,094 --> 00:59:15,814
Are you familiar with
Sintara Golden's work?

1162
00:59:18,307 --> 00:59:19,766
Vaguely.

1163
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,690
<i>Oh, she's great. You're
going to love her, man.</i>

1164
00:59:27,607 --> 00:59:30,527
I brought you lunch, Mr. Monk.

1165
00:59:31,737 --> 00:59:32,821
Oh, wow.

1166
00:59:36,074 --> 00:59:37,451
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1167
00:59:37,534 --> 00:59:40,120
Well, I have a favor to ask.

1168
00:59:42,831 --> 00:59:44,249
I was wondering
if I might be able

1169
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:45,834
to take the afternoon off.

1170
00:59:47,377 --> 00:59:49,296
Maynard just came
in from the beach.

1171
00:59:49,379 --> 00:59:50,964
And we thought it might be nice

1172
00:59:51,048 --> 00:59:52,549
to visit a museum.

1173
00:59:52,632 --> 00:59:54,343
Yes, of course.

1174
00:59:54,426 --> 00:59:56,428
I'm free today, so I
can look after Mother.

1175
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:02,851
Lorraine.

1176
01:00:03,852 --> 01:00:04,895
Hm?

1177
01:00:04,978 --> 01:00:05,979
You really like him, huh?

1178
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:09,858
He's a fine man.

1179
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:20,702
Yeah.

1180
01:00:22,287 --> 01:00:24,122
Page seven. It's got like 12.

1181
01:00:25,457 --> 01:00:29,211
The guests of honor.

1182
01:00:29,294 --> 01:00:32,464
Hello, Mrs. Ellison.
Looking beautiful as ever.

1183
01:00:32,547 --> 01:00:33,840
Hello, Arthur.

1184
01:00:36,426 --> 01:00:38,237
Layne, would you take Mrs.
Ellison to the kitchen,

1185
01:00:38,261 --> 01:00:39,805
and set her up with some tea?

1186
01:00:39,888 --> 01:00:41,014
Right this way, ma'am.

1187
01:00:41,098 --> 01:00:42,099
Mother, I won't be long.

1188
01:00:42,933 --> 01:00:44,059
Take your time.

1189
01:00:45,394 --> 01:00:46,561
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

1190
01:00:47,479 --> 01:00:48,855
Not the pods.

1191
01:00:48,939 --> 01:00:51,066
The good tea, for guests.

1192
01:00:53,402 --> 01:00:55,487
What is this? I told
you to dress street.

1193
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:58,073
- I did.
- Fucking Sesame Street.

1194
01:00:59,533 --> 01:01:01,326
What's this guy's name?

1195
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:03,662
- Willy?
- Wiley. Wiley Valdespino.

1196
01:01:03,745 --> 01:01:06,498
He specializes in
Oscar-baity "issue" movies.

1197
01:01:06,581 --> 01:01:09,042
He did the <i>Middle
Passage</i> one last year.

1198
01:01:09,126 --> 01:01:10,335
Somehow I didn't see that.

1199
01:01:10,419 --> 01:01:11,813
Of course, not. You're
not lobotomized.

1200
01:01:11,837 --> 01:01:13,213
But if he adapts your book,

1201
01:01:13,296 --> 01:01:14,965
you stand to make
a lot of money.

1202
01:01:15,048 --> 01:01:16,591
Why can't we just
do a phone call?

1203
01:01:16,675 --> 01:01:18,528
Well, he said if he's going
to cut a check this large,

1204
01:01:18,552 --> 01:01:20,178
then he needs to meet in person.

1205
01:01:20,262 --> 01:01:21,263
All right.

1206
01:01:22,097 --> 01:01:24,015
What do I need to do?

1207
01:01:24,099 --> 01:01:25,142
Just make him like you.

1208
01:01:25,225 --> 01:01:26,476
When I talked to him,

1209
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,228
he seemed thrilled
that you're a fugitive.

1210
01:01:28,311 --> 01:01:29,646
Just, you know, play that up.

1211
01:01:29,729 --> 01:01:31,022
But what if he recognizes me?

1212
01:01:31,106 --> 01:01:32,232
- You?
- Yeah, the real me.

1213
01:01:32,315 --> 01:01:34,484
Monk, you're not that famous.

1214
01:01:34,568 --> 01:01:35,986
And nobody in Hollywood reads.

1215
01:01:36,069 --> 01:01:37,779
They got their assistants
to read things,

1216
01:01:37,863 --> 01:01:38,989
and then summarize them.

1217
01:01:39,072 --> 01:01:40,740
The whole town runs
on book reports.

1218
01:01:42,325 --> 01:01:43,827
You sure you can
look after my mother?

1219
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:45,162
She won't leave my sight.

1220
01:01:45,245 --> 01:01:46,845
You'll just be across
the street, anyway.

1221
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:49,166
Across the street.

1222
01:01:49,249 --> 01:01:50,449
You should go. You'll be late.

1223
01:01:51,209 --> 01:01:52,461
He's waiting for you.

1224
01:01:54,337 --> 01:01:56,089
Well

1225
01:01:56,173 --> 01:01:59,718
if he, uh, wants the stereotype,

1226
01:02:01,011 --> 01:02:02,095
maybe it's better I'm late.

1227
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:29,206
Stagg, I presume?

1228
01:02:30,081 --> 01:02:31,082
That's me.

1229
01:02:31,166 --> 01:02:33,251
Hey, I'm Wiley.

1230
01:02:33,335 --> 01:02:34,375
Nice to meet you, brother.

1231
01:02:41,676 --> 01:02:43,345
Sorry about the
bougie restaurant.

1232
01:02:43,428 --> 01:02:45,305
My assistant picked it.

1233
01:02:45,388 --> 01:02:47,599
We can go somewhere else
if you're uncomfortable.

1234
01:02:47,682 --> 01:02:49,100
- This is fine.
- Okay.

1235
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:51,811
What are you drinking?

1236
01:02:54,439 --> 01:02:55,941
I'll have a Chenin Blanc.

1237
01:02:56,024 --> 01:02:57,192
All right.

1238
01:02:57,275 --> 01:02:58,276
Of your driest.

1239
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:02,322
Well, what's funny?

1240
01:03:02,405 --> 01:03:04,325
Ah, it's just a strange
order for a guy like you.

1241
01:03:04,991 --> 01:03:06,493
Why is that?

1242
01:03:06,576 --> 01:03:08,870
Well, you don't see many
convicts drinking white wine.

1243
01:03:09,746 --> 01:03:11,915
You know many convicts?

1244
01:03:11,998 --> 01:03:13,124
You'd be surprised.

1245
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:15,627
I spent a month in
the joint myself.

1246
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:17,063
It was some interstate
commerce shit.

1247
01:03:17,087 --> 01:03:18,807
It was a short stay,
but I'll tell you what,

1248
01:03:19,339 --> 01:03:21,132
that experience grounded me.

1249
01:03:21,216 --> 01:03:22,968
The people I met in
there allowed me to see

1250
01:03:23,051 --> 01:03:25,512
a whole world of
underrepresented stories

1251
01:03:25,595 --> 01:03:27,514
from underrepresented
storytellers.

1252
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:30,600
Can I ask what you were in for?

1253
01:03:30,684 --> 01:03:33,812
I don't like to talk about that.

1254
01:03:35,146 --> 01:03:36,147
You feel me?

1255
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:37,691
Was it murder?

1256
01:03:38,567 --> 01:03:39,943
You said that, not me.

1257
01:03:43,154 --> 01:03:44,406
You know,

1258
01:03:44,489 --> 01:03:46,157
I got to tell you,
before you showed up,

1259
01:03:46,241 --> 01:03:49,077
I was a little worried
you might be a phony.

1260
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,620
A lot of fakes in Hollywood.

1261
01:03:50,704 --> 01:03:52,122
Well, I'm not from Hollywood.

1262
01:03:52,205 --> 01:03:53,540
Yeah, yeah, no. That's obvious.

1263
01:03:53,623 --> 01:03:54,916
That's obvious.

1264
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,168
Clearly, you're cut
from a different cloth

1265
01:03:57,252 --> 01:03:58,253
than your average

1266
01:03:59,254 --> 01:04:00,505
screenwriter.

1267
01:04:00,589 --> 01:04:01,798
Let me ask you...

1268
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:03,276
I know they sent you
some of my stuff.

1269
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,100
Did you have a chance
to see any of my movies?

1270
01:04:07,512 --> 01:04:09,389
Sorry, what did you say?

1271
01:04:09,472 --> 01:04:10,672
Have you seen any of my movies?

1272
01:04:11,182 --> 01:04:12,976
Uh, no.

1273
01:04:13,059 --> 01:04:14,185
Okay.

1274
01:04:14,269 --> 01:04:15,604
Well, look, what I like to do

1275
01:04:15,687 --> 01:04:19,441
is I like to pair genre
with real-world pathos.

1276
01:04:19,524 --> 01:04:21,067
It kind of elevates things.

1277
01:04:21,151 --> 01:04:22,378
You might be
interested in this one

1278
01:04:22,402 --> 01:04:23,602
we're about to shoot actually.

1279
01:04:24,404 --> 01:04:26,197
It's about this white couple.

1280
01:04:26,281 --> 01:04:28,992
They get married on an old
plantation in Louisiana.

1281
01:04:29,075 --> 01:04:30,744
Then all the slave
ghosts come back,

1282
01:04:30,827 --> 01:04:31,911
and they murder everyone.

1283
01:04:31,995 --> 01:04:33,955
- Dear God.
- I know. I know.

1284
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:35,457
It's great, right?

1285
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,125
It's called <i>Plantation
Annihilation.</i>

1286
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:39,419
Ryan Reynolds is going
to get decapitated

1287
01:04:39,502 --> 01:04:41,546
with an afro pick in
the opening scene.

1288
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:42,964
He's a friend.

1289
01:04:43,632 --> 01:04:44,633
Got to go.

1290
01:04:55,685 --> 01:04:59,147
Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother!

1291
01:05:11,034 --> 01:05:12,869
Some ad exec on the third floor

1292
01:05:12,952 --> 01:05:14,162
had an aneurysm.

1293
01:05:14,245 --> 01:05:15,914
- Awful.
- I know.

1294
01:05:15,997 --> 01:05:17,457
Imagine exploding your brain

1295
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:19,376
trying to think of a
toilet paper commercial.

1296
01:05:21,544 --> 01:05:23,046
I assume Wiley isn't interested.

1297
01:05:23,129 --> 01:05:26,091
I sprinted out of there
like a complete maniac.

1298
01:05:26,174 --> 01:05:29,928
Actually, he's offering
$4 million for the rights.

1299
01:05:30,011 --> 01:05:32,222
- What?
- Yeah, man.

1300
01:05:32,305 --> 01:05:33,640
He called you the real deal.

1301
01:05:33,723 --> 01:05:34,974
Said you took off the moment

1302
01:05:35,058 --> 01:05:36,267
you heard police sirens.

1303
01:05:37,352 --> 01:05:39,813
The dumber I behave,
the richer I get.

1304
01:05:39,896 --> 01:05:42,273
Now you know why my parents
moved here from Puerto Rico.

1305
01:05:46,069 --> 01:05:48,154
<i>I mean, we can't
be expected to read</i>

1306
01:05:48,238 --> 01:05:51,199
<i>every novel all the
way through, right?</i>

1307
01:05:51,282 --> 01:05:53,201
No, people have worked
hard on these books.

1308
01:05:53,284 --> 01:05:54,452
And we have to respect that.

1309
01:05:54,536 --> 01:05:56,162
Well, hard work
doesn't demand respect.

1310
01:05:56,246 --> 01:05:57,372
I mean, you know,

1311
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:58,974
people worked hard
on the Third Reich.

1312
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:02,836
Yeah, well, I feel
that we owe it to them

1313
01:06:02,919 --> 01:06:04,254
to read every page.

1314
01:06:04,337 --> 01:06:05,797
That is such horseshit.

1315
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,549
I mean, most of it's going to be

1316
01:06:07,632 --> 01:06:09,926
that Knausgard
auto-fiction crap, anyhow.

1317
01:06:10,009 --> 01:06:11,195
I tell you something right now,

1318
01:06:11,219 --> 01:06:12,679
I'm not reading 600 pages

1319
01:06:12,762 --> 01:06:14,431
about some pretentious jackwagon

1320
01:06:14,514 --> 01:06:15,807
discovering masturbation.

1321
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:17,308
<i>Sorry.</i>

1322
01:06:17,392 --> 01:06:19,728
Okay, look, I think we're
all experienced enough

1323
01:06:19,811 --> 01:06:21,187
to assess the general quality

1324
01:06:21,271 --> 01:06:23,064
of something within 100 pages.

1325
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:25,567
If you want to read beyond that,

1326
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:26,818
that's your prerogative.

1327
01:06:26,901 --> 01:06:29,404
Well, how do you feel, Monk?

1328
01:06:29,487 --> 01:06:32,240
Um, I agree with
Sintara, actually.

1329
01:06:32,323 --> 01:06:34,492
I think 100 pages is sufficient.

1330
01:06:34,576 --> 01:06:36,369
You know, this is
all a crock, anyway.

1331
01:06:36,453 --> 01:06:38,997
I mean, pitting art against
other art for awards,

1332
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,749
like, it's not subjective.

1333
01:06:40,832 --> 01:06:42,459
<i>It's absurd.</i>

1334
01:06:42,542 --> 01:06:44,353
Then why did you agree to be
a judge if you feel that way?

1335
01:06:44,377 --> 01:06:47,172
Well, because it's either me
or some other Brooklyn hack

1336
01:06:47,255 --> 01:06:48,441
who doesn't think
there's a world

1337
01:06:48,465 --> 01:06:50,049
beyond the Hudson River, Ailene.

1338
01:06:50,133 --> 01:06:53,803
It's the East River if
you're in Brooklyn, Daniel.

1339
01:06:53,887 --> 01:06:54,721
<i>You know what,</i>

1340
01:06:54,804 --> 01:06:56,431
art is subjective.

1341
01:06:56,514 --> 01:06:59,142
But I think this
is an opportunity

1342
01:06:59,225 --> 01:07:03,438
to highlight books that may
otherwise be undervalued.

1343
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:05,690
<i>Book sales are
plummeting right now.</i>

1344
01:07:05,774 --> 01:07:08,151
So, perhaps this
award can give someone

1345
01:07:08,234 --> 01:07:10,361
a real chance at a
career in this industry.

1346
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,281
Hear, hear.

1347
01:07:14,574 --> 01:07:15,909
Um...

1348
01:07:15,992 --> 01:07:17,452
Where do you want this, Mother?

1349
01:07:18,703 --> 01:07:20,079
Thought it might look nice here

1350
01:07:20,163 --> 01:07:21,206
with this natural light.

1351
01:07:22,165 --> 01:07:23,333
I don't care.

1352
01:07:23,416 --> 01:07:25,168
I never liked that
painting, anyway.

1353
01:07:27,128 --> 01:07:28,463
Okay.

1354
01:07:28,546 --> 01:07:31,424
Uh, well, I'll
bring some more art

1355
01:07:31,508 --> 01:07:32,759
from home next week.

1356
01:07:32,842 --> 01:07:35,261
And you just tell me
the pieces you like,

1357
01:07:35,345 --> 01:07:37,263
and I'll bring them.

1358
01:07:37,347 --> 01:07:39,557
We've got your lunch ready
for you, Mrs. Ellison.

1359
01:07:40,683 --> 01:07:43,561
Oh, it looks great. What is it?

1360
01:07:43,645 --> 01:07:46,856
It's roasted turkey and
Havarti on 12-grain.

1361
01:07:48,191 --> 01:07:49,734
Sounds delicious.

1362
01:07:49,818 --> 01:07:52,403
Mrs. Ellison
prefers white bread.

1363
01:07:52,487 --> 01:07:53,822
And she doesn't like the crust.

1364
01:07:54,656 --> 01:07:56,032
As much as this place costs,

1365
01:07:56,115 --> 01:07:57,826
y'all should get the
sandwiches right.

1366
01:07:57,909 --> 01:07:59,911
I'll make sure that
we take care of that

1367
01:07:59,994 --> 01:08:01,162
from now on, okay?

1368
01:08:01,246 --> 01:08:03,540
And enjoy your
lunch, Mrs. Ellison.

1369
01:08:13,925 --> 01:08:14,926
I'm getting married.

1370
01:08:15,802 --> 01:08:16,803
- Shut up.
- What?

1371
01:08:19,264 --> 01:08:22,058
I didn't say nothing
earlier. I was just so sad.

1372
01:08:22,141 --> 01:08:26,604
But Maynard asked me yesterday.

1373
01:08:26,688 --> 01:08:30,692
Lorraine, that's amazing.

1374
01:08:30,775 --> 01:08:32,694
- I mean, let's celebrate.
- Mm-mm!

1375
01:08:32,777 --> 01:08:34,779
Just too much excitement.

1376
01:08:34,863 --> 01:08:36,906
I don't like being the
center of attention.

1377
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:38,825
Well, you deserve it, Lorraine.

1378
01:08:38,908 --> 01:08:41,160
And Maynard is a lucky man.

1379
01:08:45,498 --> 01:08:46,958
Do you think you'd be willing

1380
01:08:47,041 --> 01:08:48,960
to walk me down the
aisle, Mr. Monk?

1381
01:08:52,839 --> 01:08:53,840
I'd be honored.

1382
01:08:59,095 --> 01:09:01,848
Wow. Wow.

1383
01:09:04,934 --> 01:09:06,144
<i>We are wildly excited</i>

1384
01:09:06,227 --> 01:09:07,645
<i>to help you get</i> My Pafology <i>out.</i>

1385
01:09:07,729 --> 01:09:09,439
<i>The marketing team has all kinds</i>

1386
01:09:09,522 --> 01:09:11,524
<i>of great ideas to
help you sell it.</i>

1387
01:09:11,608 --> 01:09:13,776
Great. We're excited to hear.

1388
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:15,460
John Bosco is the head
of the department.

1389
01:09:15,486 --> 01:09:16,646
I will let him tell you more.

1390
01:09:17,113 --> 01:09:18,114
Hi, Stagg.

1391
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:20,283
Hello.

1392
01:09:20,366 --> 01:09:22,201
Nice to finally
meet you, my man.

1393
01:09:22,911 --> 01:09:25,038
Listen, I love the book.

1394
01:09:25,121 --> 01:09:28,291
And we are going to
sell many, many copies.

1395
01:09:28,374 --> 01:09:30,627
There's already so much buzz
because of the movie deal.

1396
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:32,962
And we just want to keep
that momentum going.

1397
01:09:33,046 --> 01:09:34,797
I spoke to Wiley yesterday.

1398
01:09:34,881 --> 01:09:36,758
He says Michael B.
Jordan is circling.

1399
01:09:36,841 --> 01:09:38,092
<i>We heard.</i>

1400
01:09:38,176 --> 01:09:39,320
<i>We think he would be
absolutely perfect.</i>

1401
01:09:39,344 --> 01:09:40,470
<i>You know, this book,</i>

1402
01:09:40,553 --> 01:09:42,513
it's awards-bait
with a capital B.

1403
01:09:42,597 --> 01:09:44,450
And we're thinking that
if Michael does sign on,

1404
01:09:44,474 --> 01:09:45,674
we want to put him on the cover

1405
01:09:45,725 --> 01:09:47,852
in one of those, um, scarves,

1406
01:09:47,936 --> 01:09:49,856
I guess you would call
them, tied round his head.

1407
01:09:50,396 --> 01:09:51,648
A durag?

1408
01:09:51,856 --> 01:09:54,484
<i>Durag. That's it.
Durag and a tank top</i>

1409
01:09:54,567 --> 01:09:55,818
with the muscles showing.

1410
01:09:55,902 --> 01:09:57,338
Ooh, somebody call
the fire department.

1411
01:09:57,362 --> 01:09:58,404
<i>Yummy.</i>

1412
01:09:59,697 --> 01:10:01,783
Shit. Sorry. Your dad. Sorry.

1413
01:10:01,866 --> 01:10:04,160
<i>So listen, for a release date,</i>

1414
01:10:04,243 --> 01:10:05,828
we're thinking of rushing it,

1415
01:10:05,912 --> 01:10:07,192
so that we can
get it out in time

1416
01:10:07,246 --> 01:10:08,164
- for Juneteenth.
- Yeah.

1417
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:09,749
Juneteenth?

1418
01:10:09,832 --> 01:10:12,627
<i>We're thinking of making
a big holiday push.</i>

1419
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:14,295
Black people will
be celebrating,

1420
01:10:14,379 --> 01:10:15,964
white people will be feeling,

1421
01:10:16,047 --> 01:10:18,925
let's be honest, a little
conscious-stricken.

1422
01:10:19,008 --> 01:10:21,128
<i>We think it's going to be a
huge moment for your book.</i>

1423
01:10:22,261 --> 01:10:23,388
So, Stagg,

1424
01:10:23,471 --> 01:10:24,847
are you so, so happy?

1425
01:10:26,391 --> 01:10:29,852
We think it's great,
John, really. Amazing.

1426
01:10:31,229 --> 01:10:32,522
Yeah, it's, uh...

1427
01:10:33,648 --> 01:10:34,649
It's great.

1428
01:10:35,692 --> 01:10:38,945
And, you know, I've got an idea

1429
01:10:39,028 --> 01:10:41,030
I want to share with you two.

1430
01:10:41,114 --> 01:10:42,448
<i>Oh, well,</i>

1431
01:10:42,532 --> 01:10:43,884
<i>I mean, we always love
to hear great ideas.</i>

1432
01:10:43,908 --> 01:10:45,243
<i>- Oh, yeah, cool.
- Yeah.</i>

1433
01:10:45,326 --> 01:10:46,661
I want to change the title.

1434
01:10:47,578 --> 01:10:48,705
Uh...

1435
01:10:48,788 --> 01:10:49,872
- I don't...
- Okay.

1436
01:10:49,956 --> 01:10:51,416
Um, well, just to be clear,

1437
01:10:51,499 --> 01:10:53,084
we really do love.

1438
01:10:53,167 --> 01:10:54,502
<i>- My Pafology.</i>
- Love it.

1439
01:10:54,585 --> 01:10:56,713
It's got that whole Irvine Welsh

1440
01:10:56,796 --> 01:10:58,923
- proletarian vernacular thing.
- Yeah.

1441
01:10:59,007 --> 01:11:00,675
No, and that's why I think

1442
01:11:00,758 --> 01:11:02,969
you're going to love
this new title even more.

1443
01:11:03,928 --> 01:11:05,263
Well, okay, you know what,

1444
01:11:05,346 --> 01:11:08,850
we're always happy
to hear new ideas.

1445
01:11:08,933 --> 01:11:10,309
<i>What did you have in mind?</i>

1446
01:11:10,393 --> 01:11:11,394
<i>Fuck.</i>

1447
01:11:18,568 --> 01:11:19,861
I'm sorry. Pardon me.

1448
01:11:19,944 --> 01:11:20,945
<i>Fuck.</i>

1449
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,823
I want to call it <i>Fuck.</i>

1450
01:11:27,118 --> 01:11:29,037
- What are you doing?
- Screw these idiots.

1451
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,288
- Stop it.
- No.

1452
01:11:32,874 --> 01:11:35,877
<i>So, Stagg, what
about, uh, like,</i> Damn?

1453
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,421
<i>- Mm-hm.</i>
- Damn? <i>Or</i> Hell?

1454
01:11:39,422 --> 01:11:40,757
Nah. <i>Fuck.</i>

1455
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,967
Okay, that's cool. Uh...

1456
01:11:43,051 --> 01:11:46,679
But maybe we could do
that with a PH instead

1457
01:11:46,763 --> 01:11:47,906
<i>because that would
be more palatable...</i>

1458
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:49,170
- Yes. Yes.
<i>- to our sellers.</i>

1459
01:11:49,223 --> 01:11:51,059
I don't care about all that.

1460
01:11:51,142 --> 01:11:54,312
And if you don't change
the title, the deal is off.

1461
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:55,855
- Oh, yeah. No.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1462
01:11:55,938 --> 01:11:58,816
- There's no need to be hasty.
- No, no, no.

1463
01:11:59,567 --> 01:12:00,568
You know what?

1464
01:12:01,569 --> 01:12:02,445
Why don't we...

1465
01:12:02,528 --> 01:12:03,571
Juts give us a second

1466
01:12:03,654 --> 01:12:06,324
and, um, a moment

1467
01:12:06,407 --> 01:12:08,242
and we will get right
back to you, okay?

1468
01:12:08,993 --> 01:12:10,244
What are you doing?

1469
01:12:10,328 --> 01:12:11,764
What are you doing?
This is ridiculous.

1470
01:12:11,788 --> 01:12:13,015
Do you know how much
money we're talking about?

1471
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:14,391
I don't care, I'm
shutting it down.

1472
01:12:14,415 --> 01:12:15,809
- Shutting it... Come on.
- Shutting it down.

1473
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:17,153
- <i>Are you there?</i>
- Please, just...

1474
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,338
We're here.

1475
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:22,381
Let's do it.

1476
01:12:23,174 --> 01:12:24,175
- What?
- What?

1477
01:12:24,675 --> 01:12:25,802
Yeah. We discussed it,

1478
01:12:25,885 --> 01:12:27,071
and we think it is
very in your face

1479
01:12:27,095 --> 01:12:28,596
in the best way possible.

1480
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:30,264
<i>It is very, uh...</i>

1481
01:12:31,474 --> 01:12:32,725
<i>Uh...</i>

1482
01:12:33,976 --> 01:12:35,436
- Black?
- <i>That's it.</i>

1483
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,687
<i>Yes, that's it.</i>

1484
01:12:36,771 --> 01:12:38,106
<i>I'm happy you said
it, and not me.</i>

1485
01:12:40,024 --> 01:12:41,275
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

1486
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:42,628
- It's fucking great, Stagg.
- I love it.

1487
01:12:42,652 --> 01:12:44,195
- Yes.
- Oh, my...

1488
01:12:44,278 --> 01:12:46,280
You know, it's so
brave actually.

1489
01:12:52,203 --> 01:12:53,121
I'm exhausted.

1490
01:12:53,204 --> 01:12:54,455
Yeah, me too.

1491
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:57,166
I got to stay up
a few more hours

1492
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:58,501
reading these books for...

1493
01:13:10,304 --> 01:13:11,347
Hey.

1494
01:13:12,431 --> 01:13:13,432
Hey.

1495
01:13:14,851 --> 01:13:16,352
Hey. Hey!

1496
01:13:17,603 --> 01:13:19,647
Bro. Oh, shit.

1497
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:20,731
What are you doing here?

1498
01:13:21,858 --> 01:13:23,460
- What am I doing here?
- What are you doing here?

1499
01:13:23,484 --> 01:13:24,545
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

1500
01:13:24,569 --> 01:13:25,444
Why are you in town?

1501
01:13:25,528 --> 01:13:27,113
I came to see our mother.

1502
01:13:27,196 --> 01:13:29,365
Ain't that what you been
calling me about for weeks now?

1503
01:13:31,868 --> 01:13:32,886
What happened to your eye?

1504
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:35,288
- I got into a fight.
- Yeah.

1505
01:13:35,371 --> 01:13:36,831
Well, get out of the pool.

1506
01:13:36,914 --> 01:13:38,267
- You're making a mess.
- I don't want

1507
01:13:38,291 --> 01:13:40,011
to get out of the pool.
I'm a grown-ass man.

1508
01:13:40,042 --> 01:13:41,169
This your girlfriend?

1509
01:13:41,252 --> 01:13:43,129
Yeah, you scared
the shit out of her.

1510
01:13:43,212 --> 01:13:44,839
I'm Coraline.

1511
01:13:45,756 --> 01:13:47,008
Hi, Coraline.

1512
01:13:47,091 --> 01:13:48,384
At least she's not white again.

1513
01:13:48,467 --> 01:13:50,511
Your wife was white.

1514
01:13:50,595 --> 01:13:52,346
My wife was a beard.
Beards don't count.

1515
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:53,306
Well, get out.

1516
01:13:53,389 --> 01:13:54,807
You fucking menace.

1517
01:13:54,891 --> 01:13:55,975
You'll wake the neighbors.

1518
01:13:56,184 --> 01:13:57,059
You know, fuck your neighbors!

1519
01:13:57,143 --> 01:13:58,728
And fuck your clean pool!

1520
01:13:58,811 --> 01:14:01,314
It's all just a part of your
superiority complex, anyway.

1521
01:14:01,397 --> 01:14:03,107
Fucking asshole.

1522
01:14:05,818 --> 01:14:09,530
You are a goddamn child!

1523
01:14:10,907 --> 01:14:12,347
It's probably a bad
time to tell you,

1524
01:14:12,408 --> 01:14:13,492
but I did piss down there.

1525
01:14:13,576 --> 01:14:14,577
Fuck.

1526
01:14:16,913 --> 01:14:18,206
Oh, funny, huh?

1527
01:14:18,289 --> 01:14:19,415
I'm sorry, Monk.

1528
01:14:19,498 --> 01:14:20,499
Don't get mad.

1529
01:14:21,792 --> 01:14:23,002
Get out of here.

1530
01:14:24,212 --> 01:14:25,338
You want a piece of me?

1531
01:14:30,885 --> 01:14:31,886
It's funny, huh?

1532
01:14:33,471 --> 01:14:35,806
So I'm lying in bed with him,

1533
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:38,392
butt-ass naked

1534
01:14:38,476 --> 01:14:41,020
and in walks Claude
carrying the frozen yogurt.

1535
01:14:41,103 --> 01:14:42,813
- No.
- Yeah, I forgot I'd shown him

1536
01:14:42,897 --> 01:14:44,190
where I keep the spare key.

1537
01:14:45,149 --> 01:14:48,194
So he just throws
the yogurt at us

1538
01:14:48,277 --> 01:14:50,655
and then he wallops
me right in the eye.

1539
01:14:52,823 --> 01:14:54,283
What was the other guy doing?

1540
01:14:54,367 --> 01:14:55,826
He couldn't stop laughing.

1541
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:57,721
He said that's what he
does when he gets nervous.

1542
01:14:57,745 --> 01:14:58,913
Okay.

1543
01:14:58,996 --> 01:15:00,748
You really going
for it these days.

1544
01:15:00,831 --> 01:15:02,583
I only been gay for,
like, five minutes,

1545
01:15:02,667 --> 01:15:03,918
I got to make up for lost time.

1546
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:05,920
Yeah. Well, good for you.

1547
01:15:06,003 --> 01:15:07,588
I mean, the whole
world's falling apart.

1548
01:15:07,672 --> 01:15:09,090
Might as well have some fun.

1549
01:15:09,173 --> 01:15:10,591
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah.

1550
01:15:11,634 --> 01:15:12,927
You know, you're
quite beautiful.

1551
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:15,554
Thank you.

1552
01:15:18,224 --> 01:15:19,850
What do you see in my brother?

1553
01:15:21,352 --> 01:15:23,229
- He's funny.
- Mm.

1554
01:15:23,312 --> 01:15:26,148
- He's not funny. No.
- No, not ha-ha funny.

1555
01:15:26,232 --> 01:15:28,859
- Like, sad funny.
- Okay.

1556
01:15:28,943 --> 01:15:30,736
Like a three-legged dog.

1557
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:32,947
I see it now. Like
somebody dying on a toilet.

1558
01:15:33,698 --> 01:15:34,949
Exactly.

1559
01:15:35,032 --> 01:15:36,617
- Exactly.
- Invariably,

1560
01:15:36,701 --> 01:15:39,203
- you go too far.
- You think?

1561
01:15:39,287 --> 01:15:40,538
I don't think I go far enough.

1562
01:15:40,621 --> 01:15:41,706
It's becoming hurtful.

1563
01:15:41,789 --> 01:15:43,249
- Aw.
- See?

1564
01:15:43,332 --> 01:15:44,333
- See?
- "You know,

1565
01:15:44,417 --> 01:15:45,209
- "invariably..."
- Oh.

1566
01:15:45,293 --> 01:15:47,420
"you go too far."

1567
01:15:47,503 --> 01:15:49,463
Yeah.

1568
01:15:49,547 --> 01:15:50,756
You got a kiss, man.

1569
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,551
Look at you. Just
by being pathetic.

1570
01:15:53,634 --> 01:15:54,760
- God bless you.
- Hey.

1571
01:15:54,844 --> 01:15:56,470
That is like

1572
01:15:56,554 --> 01:15:57,763
- a three-legged dog.
- Hey.

1573
01:16:03,728 --> 01:16:06,314
Oh, this is nice.

1574
01:16:06,397 --> 01:16:07,481
Yeah, it's not bad.

1575
01:16:08,524 --> 01:16:10,026
What do you got there, pergola?

1576
01:16:10,109 --> 01:16:11,110
No, that's a gazebo.

1577
01:16:11,986 --> 01:16:13,070
Same difference.

1578
01:16:13,154 --> 01:16:14,030
- All right?
- To the left.

1579
01:16:14,113 --> 01:16:15,156
Oh. Excuse me.

1580
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:18,200
Huh.

1581
01:16:19,702 --> 01:16:21,537
Hey, Monk?

1582
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:23,372
How the hell can you
afford this place?

1583
01:16:24,582 --> 01:16:25,583
I, um...

1584
01:16:27,335 --> 01:16:31,213
Well, there was some money
Lisa left for Mother.

1585
01:16:31,297 --> 01:16:32,697
Thought the divorce
cleaned her out.

1586
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,053
Well, I'm not familiar with
what her finances were like,

1587
01:16:37,136 --> 01:16:39,138
but if you're so
interested in the bills,

1588
01:16:39,221 --> 01:16:41,098
perhaps I can start
sending them to you?

1589
01:16:41,182 --> 01:16:42,892
Ah, it's fine. Where we going?

1590
01:16:42,975 --> 01:16:43,976
Right here. 44.

1591
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:47,313
Surprise!

1592
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,611
We've had a difficult morning.

1593
01:16:57,615 --> 01:16:59,735
We had to sedate her after
she tried to strike a nurse.

1594
01:17:00,493 --> 01:17:02,620
- Has she done that before?
- No.

1595
01:17:04,038 --> 01:17:05,558
She has a different
demeanor every day.

1596
01:17:06,165 --> 01:17:07,958
Sometimes every hour.

1597
01:17:08,042 --> 01:17:09,835
But maybe she'll
feel better tomorrow.

1598
01:17:10,711 --> 01:17:12,338
I'm sorry, I need to go.

1599
01:17:12,421 --> 01:17:14,590
Yes, of course. Thank you.

1600
01:17:16,217 --> 01:17:17,301
The gardener cut these

1601
01:17:17,385 --> 01:17:19,553
right off the bush for your mom.

1602
01:17:19,637 --> 01:17:21,639
- Sweet, right?
- Yeah, that's great.

1603
01:17:22,765 --> 01:17:24,350
How can you afford this place?

1604
01:17:24,975 --> 01:17:26,185
I mean, you're not

1605
01:17:26,268 --> 01:17:27,978
a drug dealer or
something, are you?

1606
01:17:29,021 --> 01:17:30,648
No, I'm a writer.

1607
01:17:30,731 --> 01:17:33,192
And you're my girlfriend,
not my bookkeeper.

You sure you don't want to

1625
01:19:03,616 --> 01:19:04,909
It's better if I go.

1626
01:19:10,247 --> 01:19:12,082
It was nice to meet you, Cliff.

1627
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:18,214
This family will
break your heart.

1628
01:19:47,409 --> 01:19:49,537
Welcome back. I'm Kenya Dunston

1629
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:51,121
and today, we're
going to discuss

1630
01:19:51,205 --> 01:19:53,541
a new novel that just
debuted at number one

1631
01:19:53,624 --> 01:19:55,834
on <i>The New York Times</i>
bestseller list.

1632
01:19:55,918 --> 01:19:59,672
It is just a remarkable,
special book,

1633
01:19:59,755 --> 01:20:01,590
and it's called...

1634
01:20:01,674 --> 01:20:03,717
Cover your kids'
eyes and ears...

1635
01:20:06,929 --> 01:20:08,180
We are lucky enough

1636
01:20:08,264 --> 01:20:10,099
to have the author
with us today.

1637
01:20:10,182 --> 01:20:12,434
And for those of you
who are just joining us,

1638
01:20:12,518 --> 01:20:14,144
please know that
Mr. Stagg R. Leigh

1639
01:20:14,228 --> 01:20:16,605
is coming to us from
an undisclosed location

1640
01:20:16,689 --> 01:20:18,816
as he is still on the
run from authorities.

1641
01:20:20,609 --> 01:20:24,572
{\an8}Oh, Stagg, tell us, is
this novel a true story?

1642
01:20:24,655 --> 01:20:26,365
{\an8}<i>Not factually,</i>

1643
01:20:26,448 --> 01:20:28,242
{\an8}<i>but it's the true
story of what it's like</i>

1644
01:20:28,325 --> 01:20:31,245
{\an8}<i>to be a Black man
in America like me.</i>

1645
01:20:31,328 --> 01:20:32,328
{\an8}<i>And it ain't pretty.</i>

1646
01:20:32,371 --> 01:20:33,622
Amen to that.

1647
01:20:33,706 --> 01:20:35,541
<i>During my time in prison,</i>

1648
01:20:35,624 --> 01:20:38,544
{\an8}<i>I learned that words
belong to everybody.</i>

1649
01:20:38,627 --> 01:20:40,462
{\an8}<i>So this book is my contribution</i>

1650
01:20:40,546 --> 01:20:42,339
{\an8}<i>to this wonderful
country of ours</i>

1651
01:20:42,423 --> 01:20:44,508
{\an8}<i>where a Black ex-con
can become rich</i>

1652
01:20:44,592 --> 01:20:47,678
{\an8}<i>simply by telling the story
of his unfortunate people.</i>

1653
01:20:47,761 --> 01:20:49,263
Hm.

1654
01:20:49,346 --> 01:20:51,056
Yes. Yes.

1655
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,686
- Yeah.
- <i>Get this.</i>

1656
01:20:55,769 --> 01:20:57,438
The FBI called
Thompson Watt today

1657
01:20:57,521 --> 01:20:59,273
to try to get Stagg
R. Leigh's identity.

1658
01:20:59,356 --> 01:21:00,858
- What?
- <i>Don't worry.</i>

1659
01:21:00,941 --> 01:21:02,651
<i>They're not going
to give him up.</i>

1660
01:21:02,735 --> 01:21:04,820
Give who up? It's me, I
haven't done anything.

1661
01:21:04,903 --> 01:21:06,405
They don't know that.

1662
01:21:06,488 --> 01:21:08,991
- Look, this has gone too far.
- <i>Relax.</i>

1663
01:21:09,074 --> 01:21:10,274
The fugitive stuff's getting us

1664
01:21:10,326 --> 01:21:11,535
mountains of free press.

1665
01:21:11,619 --> 01:21:12,703
Plus, as you said,

1666
01:21:12,786 --> 01:21:13,912
you haven't done anything.

1667
01:21:13,996 --> 01:21:15,581
It's not like they
can arrest you.

1668
01:21:15,664 --> 01:21:18,125
I wish I could go back
to not selling books.

1669
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:19,209
I don't.

1670
01:21:20,169 --> 01:21:21,378
<i>Bye.</i>

1671
01:21:35,601 --> 01:21:36,602
Is everything all right?

1672
01:21:37,728 --> 01:21:39,480
Yeah.

1673
01:21:39,563 --> 01:21:42,524
I'm just a little
stressed out. This, uh.

1674
01:21:42,608 --> 01:21:44,648
Book award stuff is a bit
more work than I expected.

1675
01:21:45,486 --> 01:21:46,487
Hm.

1676
01:21:47,988 --> 01:21:48,989
Mm.

1677
01:21:49,907 --> 01:21:50,949
Shit.

1678
01:21:52,284 --> 01:21:54,662
It's no biggie. Got more
forks in the kitchen.

1679
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,097
What's this?

1680
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:15,182
Mm. My friend got it for me.

1681
01:22:16,475 --> 01:22:17,475
Have you read it?

1682
01:22:17,518 --> 01:22:18,936
Of course not, have you?

1683
01:22:19,019 --> 01:22:20,020
Yeah.

1684
01:22:22,398 --> 01:22:24,316
And what did you think of it?

1685
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:26,902
- I liked it.
- What did you like about it?

1686
01:22:26,985 --> 01:22:29,446
- Um...
- It didn't offend you?

1687
01:22:29,530 --> 01:22:30,590
You just said you
didn't read it.

1688
01:22:30,614 --> 01:22:31,614
What's your problem?

1689
01:22:31,657 --> 01:22:33,117
No, you answer my question.

1690
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,493
You answer mine.

1691
01:22:36,161 --> 01:22:39,790
{\an8}My problem is that books
like this aren't real.

1692
01:22:40,666 --> 01:22:41,875
They flatten our lives.

1693
01:22:41,959 --> 01:22:43,085
What do you mean?

1694
01:22:43,168 --> 01:22:44,253
I mean, that

1695
01:22:44,336 --> 01:22:46,338
{\an8}you know, my life is a disaster,

1696
01:22:46,422 --> 01:22:48,342
{\an8}but not in the way you'd
think reading this shit.

1697
01:22:48,799 --> 01:22:50,509
{\an8}These things reduce us

1698
01:22:50,592 --> 01:22:52,928
{\an8}and they do it over
and over again because

1699
01:22:53,011 --> 01:22:55,973
{\an8}too many white people, and
people apparently like you

1700
01:22:56,056 --> 01:22:58,600
devour this slop like
pigs at a dumpster

1701
01:22:58,684 --> 01:23:01,186
to stay current at
fucking cocktail parties

1702
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:02,604
- or whatever.
- Okay, um...

1703
01:23:02,688 --> 01:23:04,273
You got a lot of
opinions for someone

1704
01:23:04,356 --> 01:23:06,316
who hasn't published
anything for years.

1705
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,502
And you've published
what exactly?

1706
01:23:07,526 --> 01:23:09,278
Okay, what is wrong with you?

1707
01:23:10,195 --> 01:23:11,339
Why are you acting like this?

1708
01:23:11,363 --> 01:23:12,698
I'm not acting like anything.

1709
01:23:12,781 --> 01:23:14,783
You've been acting like
a weirdo for weeks.

1710
01:23:14,867 --> 01:23:16,785
You've been obfuscating,
sneaking around.

1711
01:23:16,869 --> 01:23:18,328
You're fucking unknowable.

1712
01:23:18,412 --> 01:23:20,706
Maybe you think being an
enigma is chic and artsy.

1713
01:23:20,789 --> 01:23:22,541
I just think it
makes you an asshole.

1714
01:23:22,624 --> 01:23:23,959
Well, um,

1715
01:23:24,042 --> 01:23:25,961
you don't understand
my life, and you can't,

1716
01:23:26,044 --> 01:23:27,087
so just leave it at that.

1717
01:23:31,049 --> 01:23:32,426
One day, maybe you'll learn

1718
01:23:32,509 --> 01:23:34,553
that not being able to
relate to other people

1719
01:23:34,636 --> 01:23:36,764
isn't a badge of honor.

1720
01:23:41,894 --> 01:23:43,145
I think you should leave.

1721
01:23:43,228 --> 01:23:44,247
Well, you know what I think?

1722
01:23:44,271 --> 01:23:46,106
You should leave, Monk.

1723
01:24:02,289 --> 01:24:03,582
Nonsense.

1724
01:24:28,065 --> 01:24:29,358
You guys need any
help with that?

1725
01:24:29,441 --> 01:24:30,484
Nah, we're good.

1726
01:24:32,486 --> 01:24:34,863
I thought you could
use a little brawn.

1727
01:24:34,947 --> 01:24:37,950
- We got it.
- Mr. Monk.

1728
01:24:38,033 --> 01:24:39,493
You mind I keep the soda maker?

1729
01:24:39,576 --> 01:24:41,787
You don't like the bubbly
water anyhow, right?

1730
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:43,914
- It's all yours.
- Thank you.

1731
01:24:46,291 --> 01:24:49,127
Um... Hey, what about this?

1732
01:24:50,546 --> 01:24:53,215
No. I always hated that color.

1733
01:24:53,298 --> 01:24:55,175
It's just the one
your father bought.

1734
01:24:56,426 --> 01:24:58,804
Thelonious, this
just came for you.

1735
01:24:59,763 --> 01:25:00,848
Okay, thanks.

1736
01:25:00,931 --> 01:25:01,932
This is the last of it.

1737
01:25:02,933 --> 01:25:04,226
Goodbye, Mr. Monk.

1738
01:25:07,896 --> 01:25:08,981
Bye, Lorraine.

1739
01:25:15,654 --> 01:25:16,738
Drive safe.

1740
01:25:16,822 --> 01:25:18,198
Guess I'll see you
at the wedding.

1741
01:25:18,282 --> 01:25:19,283
All right.

1742
01:25:23,412 --> 01:25:24,413
I'll take that there.

1743
01:25:45,601 --> 01:25:48,854
Thompson Watt apparently
raced to publish it.

1744
01:25:48,937 --> 01:25:51,273
Yeah, I heard that they
ran 300,000 copies already

1745
01:25:51,356 --> 01:25:52,816
and they're
reprinting more soon.

1746
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:54,401
I mean, it's going
like gangbusters.

1747
01:25:54,484 --> 01:25:55,903
Christ on a crutch!

1748
01:25:55,986 --> 01:25:57,613
It better be good.

1749
01:25:57,696 --> 01:25:59,907
<i>Hey, I heard the
writer's a fugitive.</i>

1750
01:25:59,990 --> 01:26:01,450
Well, that would
explain the title.

1751
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:02,826
He didn't go to charm school.

1752
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:05,913
No, I think that that
background is a plus.

1753
01:26:05,996 --> 01:26:08,123
I am thrilled

1754
01:26:08,206 --> 01:26:11,460
to read a BIPOC man harmed
by our carceral state.

1755
01:26:11,543 --> 01:26:14,087
<i>Are you one of those
defund the police nuts?</i>

1756
01:26:14,171 --> 01:26:17,174
Yes, and I wouldn't
expect you to understand.

1757
01:26:17,257 --> 01:26:20,052
Well, I hope someone you love
doesn't get raped or murdered.

1758
01:26:20,135 --> 01:26:22,471
Can we not talk about
this now, please?

1759
01:26:22,554 --> 01:26:24,431
Look, look, look.
Criminal or not,

1760
01:26:24,514 --> 01:26:26,099
I don't think we should add it.

1761
01:26:26,183 --> 01:26:27,726
We're already weeks
into the process,

1762
01:26:27,809 --> 01:26:29,144
and I don't know
about any of you,

1763
01:26:29,227 --> 01:26:30,580
but I've got more
than a dozen books

1764
01:26:30,604 --> 01:26:33,106
I haven't even opened yet.

1765
01:26:33,190 --> 01:26:34,910
It was published before
the submission date,

1766
01:26:34,983 --> 01:26:36,443
I think we have to accept it.

1767
01:26:37,819 --> 01:26:40,757
<i>Yeah, it's just one more.</i> And from the
looks of it, it should be a quick read.

1768
01:26:40,781 --> 01:26:41,865
A quick fuck.

1769
01:26:43,367 --> 01:26:44,785
<i>I've had a couple of those.</i>

1770
01:26:46,328 --> 01:26:47,579
Bye, guys. Bye.

1771
01:27:23,407 --> 01:27:24,658
Hi, Monkie.

1772
01:27:26,868 --> 01:27:27,953
You look beautiful.

1773
01:27:43,051 --> 01:27:45,012
Oh, hello.

1774
01:27:45,095 --> 01:27:47,931
Monkie, do we know these men?

1775
01:27:48,015 --> 01:27:50,183
No, Mother, this
isn't the Alzheimer's,

1776
01:27:50,267 --> 01:27:52,394
these are actual strangers.
Who are you people?

1777
01:27:52,477 --> 01:27:54,021
We're Cliff's friends.

1778
01:27:54,104 --> 01:27:55,605
Of course, you are.

1779
01:27:55,689 --> 01:27:57,667
We met him a few days ago.
I'm Kenny, this is Alvin.

1780
01:27:57,691 --> 01:27:58,692
Are you Monk?

1781
01:27:58,775 --> 01:28:00,861
I am. How did you know?

1782
01:28:00,944 --> 01:28:03,739
Oh. Well, Cliff said
Monk's a real tight-ass.

1783
01:28:05,657 --> 01:28:06,825
Did he?

1784
01:28:06,908 --> 01:28:07,909
Delightful.

1785
01:28:08,577 --> 01:28:09,995
Mother, you sit here.

1786
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:12,581
Lorraine?

1787
01:28:18,253 --> 01:28:19,421
Do you like scrambled eggs?

1788
01:28:19,504 --> 01:28:21,006
I love scrambled eggs.

1789
01:28:21,089 --> 01:28:22,424
What the hell are
you doing here?

1790
01:28:22,507 --> 01:28:23,508
You first.

1791
01:28:26,178 --> 01:28:28,513
Oh, shit, the wedding.

1792
01:28:28,597 --> 01:28:30,098
- Ah.
- Oh, fuck!

1793
01:28:31,975 --> 01:28:33,310
I didn't go to the airport.

1794
01:28:33,393 --> 01:28:36,563
That day I left, I needed
some time to myself.

1795
01:28:36,646 --> 01:28:39,357
Time to oneself implies
by definition, time alone.

1796
01:28:39,441 --> 01:28:40,901
Oh, Christ, here we go.

1797
01:28:40,984 --> 01:28:43,236
- Detective Dictionary.
- Ah!

1798
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:44,321
Mr. Cliff.

1799
01:28:44,404 --> 01:28:45,644
I'm sorry, guys, I'll handle it.

1800
01:28:45,697 --> 01:28:47,699
You need to leave.

1801
01:28:47,783 --> 01:28:49,367
Don't bother to
clean up, just go.

1802
01:28:49,451 --> 01:28:51,119
Oh, no, it's all right, just...

1803
01:28:51,203 --> 01:28:52,245
Please stay.

1804
01:28:52,329 --> 01:28:53,789
It's a celebration.

1805
01:28:55,457 --> 01:28:56,666
It's good to see you, Cliff.

1806
01:28:57,918 --> 01:28:59,920
It's good to see
you too, Maynard.

1807
01:29:00,003 --> 01:29:01,463
I, um...

1808
01:29:01,546 --> 01:29:02,839
I... I don't want to impose.

1809
01:29:02,923 --> 01:29:04,174
You can't impose.

1810
01:29:05,258 --> 01:29:06,259
You're family.

1811
01:29:21,525 --> 01:29:22,526
Okay.

1812
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,903
I'll, uh...

1813
01:29:24,986 --> 01:29:26,196
I'll go clean up a bit, yeah?

1814
01:29:27,948 --> 01:29:29,741
Congratulations, you guys.

1815
01:29:35,247 --> 01:29:36,706
Can we make y'all
some breakfast?

1816
01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:38,500
I can whip up a killer smoothie

1817
01:29:38,583 --> 01:29:40,311
and Alvin used to work the
omelet station on a cruise ship.

1818
01:29:40,335 --> 01:29:43,046
That sounds lovely. Thank you.

1819
01:29:47,884 --> 01:29:49,278
It's very kind of
you to let them stay.

1820
01:29:49,302 --> 01:29:50,302
Oh.

1821
01:29:50,345 --> 01:29:51,721
It's always easier dealing

1822
01:29:51,805 --> 01:29:53,723
with other people's
families than your own.

1823
01:29:55,225 --> 01:29:58,019
I regret to inform you
that in a couple hours,

1824
01:29:58,103 --> 01:29:59,563
this will be your family.

Piss her off?

1842
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,560
Yeah.

1843
01:32:03,603 --> 01:32:06,481
- Shut her out?
- Yeah.

1844
01:32:08,149 --> 01:32:09,484
Dad shut everyone out too.

1845
01:32:10,402 --> 01:32:11,778
He lied all the time.

1846
01:32:12,862 --> 01:32:13,947
Look how that turned out.

1847
01:32:17,534 --> 01:32:18,785
I find myself

1848
01:32:19,995 --> 01:32:22,247
getting very angry
these days like Dad.

1849
01:32:23,206 --> 01:32:24,207
These days?

1850
01:32:30,213 --> 01:32:32,757
I've been thinking
a lot lately about

1851
01:32:32,841 --> 01:32:34,801
how Dad died not
knowing I'm gay.

1852
01:32:38,096 --> 01:32:40,098
- I think he suspected it.
- Mm.

1853
01:32:41,308 --> 01:32:42,309
He may have.

1854
01:32:43,184 --> 01:32:44,561
But he didn't know for sure.

1855
01:32:45,979 --> 01:32:48,606
He never knew the
entirety of me.

1856
01:32:50,025 --> 01:32:51,026
And now he never will.

1857
01:32:52,861 --> 01:32:54,612
And that makes me...

1858
01:32:55,739 --> 01:32:57,032
It makes me real sad.

1859
01:33:00,368 --> 01:33:03,163
Well, what if he had
known and rejected you?

1860
01:33:03,246 --> 01:33:05,915
At least he'd be
rejecting the real me.

1861
01:33:08,752 --> 01:33:10,337
I know that sounds crazy,

1862
01:33:11,588 --> 01:33:13,131
but there'd be some
relief in that.

1863
01:33:16,468 --> 01:33:18,386
It doesn't sound so crazy.

1864
01:33:23,558 --> 01:33:25,226
People want to love you, Monk.

1865
01:33:28,021 --> 01:33:30,690
I personally don't know
what they see in you, but

1866
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:33,651
they want to love you.

1867
01:33:36,529 --> 01:33:38,156
You should let them
love all of you.

1868
01:34:12,399 --> 01:34:13,983
It was dog shit.

1869
01:34:14,067 --> 01:34:16,236
I mean, some mollycoddled chump

1870
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:18,738
faffing on about his dead mom...

1871
01:34:18,822 --> 01:34:20,740
Who cares?

1872
01:34:20,824 --> 01:34:23,910
Okay, so that means that
<i>Bury Me Standing</i> is fourth.

1873
01:34:26,246 --> 01:34:27,664
Let's talk about <i>Fuck.</i>

1874
01:34:27,747 --> 01:34:29,082
Could we not?

1875
01:34:29,165 --> 01:34:31,334
Personally, I adored it.

1876
01:34:32,585 --> 01:34:35,505
It was like gazing
into an open wound.

1877
01:34:35,588 --> 01:34:37,006
I agree.

1878
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:39,259
I think it's the strongest
African-American novel

1879
01:34:39,342 --> 01:34:41,052
I've read in a long time.

1880
01:34:42,679 --> 01:34:44,514
I mean, since yours.

1881
01:34:44,597 --> 01:34:47,267
- Of course, Sintara.
- Thank you.

1882
01:34:47,350 --> 01:34:49,519
You know, I actually liked it

1883
01:34:49,602 --> 01:34:51,062
much more than I was expecting.

1884
01:34:51,146 --> 01:34:53,815
I mean, this is a
gutsy piece of work.

1885
01:34:53,898 --> 01:34:55,859
And necessary for the times.

1886
01:34:56,860 --> 01:34:58,278
What did you think, Sintara?

1887
01:34:59,821 --> 01:35:03,032
I found it to be pretty
pandering, actually.

1888
01:35:03,116 --> 01:35:04,117
You did?

1889
01:35:04,951 --> 01:35:06,369
Yes. Did you not?

1890
01:35:07,078 --> 01:35:08,496
I very much did.

1891
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:12,000
I thought it was
simplistic and meaningless.

1892
01:35:12,083 --> 01:35:14,127
Well, of course,
it was simplistic.

1893
01:35:14,210 --> 01:35:17,213
I mean, it's the
language of the gutter.

1894
01:35:17,297 --> 01:35:19,799
You know, not some
prissy graduate thesis.

1895
01:35:19,883 --> 01:35:22,010
"Language of the
gutter." Jesus Christ.

1896
01:35:22,093 --> 01:35:23,636
I think our blood sugar's low.

1897
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:25,513
How about we take a
break for lunch, huh?

1898
01:35:25,597 --> 01:35:27,182
- Fine by me.
- Okay.

1899
01:35:27,265 --> 01:35:28,266
- Okay.
- Really?

1900
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:30,518
Okay.

1901
01:35:41,738 --> 01:35:42,906
Oh, I'm sorry.

1902
01:35:42,989 --> 01:35:44,115
Oh, no, you're fine.

1903
01:35:44,199 --> 01:35:45,074
What, I'm not interrupting?

1904
01:35:45,158 --> 01:35:46,826
No.

1905
01:36:08,348 --> 01:36:09,349
Sorry.

1906
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:26,991
Do you mind if I
ask you something?

1907
01:36:27,742 --> 01:36:28,743
Sure.

1908
01:36:29,744 --> 01:36:31,371
Um...

1909
01:36:31,454 --> 01:36:33,706
What about <i>Fuck</i> did
you find pandering?

1910
01:36:34,415 --> 01:36:35,416
Oh, uh...

1911
01:36:36,918 --> 01:36:39,128
I can't really put
my finger on it, but

1912
01:36:40,755 --> 01:36:42,675
it's not different from
some of what's out there,

1913
01:36:42,757 --> 01:36:43,800
but it just felt

1914
01:36:45,635 --> 01:36:47,303
soulless

1915
01:36:47,387 --> 01:36:49,722
is the word that
I'm going to use.

1916
01:36:49,806 --> 01:36:51,015
You said you agreed, right?

1917
01:36:51,099 --> 01:36:52,892
Yeah, I do. I think
it seems written

1918
01:36:52,976 --> 01:36:56,104
to satisfy the tastes of
guilt-ridden white people.

1919
01:36:56,187 --> 01:36:58,565
Yeah, the kind of book
critics call important

1920
01:36:58,648 --> 01:37:00,358
and necessary, but
not well-written.

1921
01:37:00,441 --> 01:37:01,943
Exactly.

1922
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:10,451
Okay, so... And please
don't take offense at this,

1923
01:37:10,535 --> 01:37:13,162
but how is <i>Fuck</i>

1924
01:37:13,246 --> 01:37:15,665
so very different
from your book?

1925
01:37:19,544 --> 01:37:21,629
Is that what this is about?

1926
01:37:21,713 --> 01:37:23,214
- You think my book's trash?
- No.

1927
01:37:23,298 --> 01:37:27,176
To be honest, I
haven't read your book.

1928
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:29,053
I've read excerpts

1929
01:37:29,137 --> 01:37:32,724
and it didn't seem
so dissimilar.

1930
01:37:34,684 --> 01:37:37,604
I did a lot of
research for my book.

1931
01:37:37,687 --> 01:37:39,939
Some of it was actually
taken from real interviews.

1932
01:37:40,773 --> 01:37:42,066
Maybe you've been up

1933
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:44,193
in your ivory tower of
academia for so long

1934
01:37:44,277 --> 01:37:46,446
you've forgotten that some
people's lives are hard.

1935
01:37:46,529 --> 01:37:47,572
Your life?

1936
01:37:50,074 --> 01:37:52,660
You went to an exclusive
bohemian college.

1937
01:37:52,744 --> 01:37:54,829
You had a job at a fancy

1938
01:37:54,912 --> 01:37:56,581
publishing house in New York.

1939
01:37:56,664 --> 01:37:59,459
So what? I don't need
to write about my life.

1940
01:37:59,542 --> 01:38:01,002
I write about what
interests people.

1941
01:38:02,337 --> 01:38:04,464
You write what interests
white publishers

1942
01:38:04,547 --> 01:38:07,216
fiending Black trauma porn.

1943
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:08,968
They're the one buying
the manuscripts.

1944
01:38:10,386 --> 01:38:12,513
Is it bad to cater
to their tastes?

1945
01:38:12,597 --> 01:38:14,557
If you're okay feeding

1946
01:38:14,641 --> 01:38:16,100
people's base
desires for profit...

1947
01:38:16,184 --> 01:38:18,144
I'm okay with giving the
market what it wants.

1948
01:38:18,227 --> 01:38:19,867
That's how drug dealers
excuse themselves.

1949
01:38:19,896 --> 01:38:21,439
And I think drugs
should be legal.

1950
01:38:26,152 --> 01:38:29,155
But you're not fed up with it?

1951
01:38:29,238 --> 01:38:31,532
You know, Black
people in poverty?

1952
01:38:32,617 --> 01:38:34,035
Black people rapping?

1953
01:38:34,118 --> 01:38:35,495
Black people as slaves?

1954
01:38:35,578 --> 01:38:37,872
Black people murdered
by the police?

1955
01:38:37,955 --> 01:38:39,016
Old soaring narratives about...

1956
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,166
Okay.

1957
01:38:40,249 --> 01:38:42,126
Black folks in
dire circumstances

1958
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:45,046
who still managed to maintain
their dignity before they die?

1959
01:38:45,129 --> 01:38:47,715
I mean, I'm not saying
these things aren't real,

1960
01:38:47,799 --> 01:38:50,927
but we're also more than this.

1961
01:38:51,010 --> 01:38:54,013
And it's like so many writers
like you can't envision us

1962
01:38:54,097 --> 01:38:56,307
without some white
boot on our necks.

1963
01:38:56,391 --> 01:38:59,102
Do you get angry at
Bret Easton Ellis

1964
01:38:59,185 --> 01:39:00,561
or Charles Bukowski

1965
01:39:00,645 --> 01:39:02,313
for writing about
the downtrodden?

1966
01:39:02,397 --> 01:39:04,565
Or is your ire strictly
reserved for Black women?

1967
01:39:04,649 --> 01:39:06,484
Nobody reads Bukowski thinking

1968
01:39:06,567 --> 01:39:08,403
his is the definitive
white experience.

1969
01:39:08,486 --> 01:39:10,321
But people, white people,

1970
01:39:10,405 --> 01:39:12,573
read your book and
confine us to it.

1971
01:39:12,657 --> 01:39:14,909
They think that
we're all like that.

1972
01:39:14,992 --> 01:39:16,661
Then it sounds like your issue

1973
01:39:16,744 --> 01:39:18,746
is with white
people, Monk, not me.

1974
01:39:18,830 --> 01:39:20,498
Well, maybe, but I also think

1975
01:39:20,581 --> 01:39:22,166
that I see the
unrealized potential

1976
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:23,490
of Black people in this country.

1977
01:39:26,713 --> 01:39:29,340
Potential is what people
see when they think

1978
01:39:29,424 --> 01:39:31,175
what's in front of
them isn't good enough.

1979
01:39:41,018 --> 01:39:43,187
So, what are we talking about?

1980
01:40:32,153 --> 01:40:33,196
We're starting again.

1981
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:34,405
I'll be right there.

1982
01:40:46,083 --> 01:40:48,377
Hey, can I speak to
Arthur? Yeah, it's Monk.

1983
01:40:51,422 --> 01:40:52,422
Hey.

1984
01:40:52,465 --> 01:40:53,883
I'm fine.

1985
01:40:53,966 --> 01:40:55,718
Listen, you think you can set up

1986
01:40:55,802 --> 01:40:57,094
another meeting with Wiley?

1987
01:40:58,179 --> 01:41:00,056
I've got a new idea for him.

1988
01:41:00,139 --> 01:41:01,933
Different kind of movie.

1989
01:41:02,016 --> 01:41:03,017
Thanks.

1990
01:41:17,365 --> 01:41:19,075
I think it's <i>Fuck</i> for me.

1991
01:41:19,158 --> 01:41:20,910
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah, I agree.

1992
01:41:20,993 --> 01:41:22,829
I disagree. I'm sorry.

1993
01:41:22,912 --> 01:41:25,206
I think it would be a mistake

1994
01:41:25,289 --> 01:41:27,708
to award this book anything.

1995
01:41:27,792 --> 01:41:29,335
Well, it's two
versus three, so...

1996
01:41:30,461 --> 01:41:31,462
<i>Fuck's</i> the winner.

1997
01:41:31,546 --> 01:41:32,964
<i>Fuck</i> is the winner.

1998
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:38,928
You know, it's not just
that it's so affecting,

1999
01:41:40,054 --> 01:41:41,681
I just think it's essential

2000
01:41:41,764 --> 01:41:43,307
to listen to Black
voices right now.

2001
01:41:51,649 --> 01:41:52,650
Mother.

2002
01:41:54,068 --> 01:41:55,069
Did you...

2003
01:41:58,489 --> 01:42:00,575
Did you know that Dad
was cheating on you?

2004
01:42:01,784 --> 01:42:04,120
He was bad at keeping secrets.

2005
01:42:04,203 --> 01:42:06,581
Why didn't you leave him?

2006
01:42:06,664 --> 01:42:09,208
He would've been even
more lonely without me.

2007
01:42:12,003 --> 01:42:13,254
You thought he was lonely?

2008
01:42:13,337 --> 01:42:15,214
You father was a genius.

2009
01:42:18,009 --> 01:42:20,970
Geniuses are lonely

2010
01:42:22,346 --> 01:42:25,808
because they can't connect
with the rest of us.

2011
01:42:27,894 --> 01:42:29,395
You're a genius, son.

2012
01:42:31,898 --> 01:42:34,400
Well, I certainly don't
feel like one half the time.

2013
01:42:35,735 --> 01:42:37,004
That's because
you've always been

2014
01:42:37,028 --> 01:42:38,905
so hard on yourself, Cliffy.

2015
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:49,874
And now for the final
award for the evening.

2016
01:42:49,957 --> 01:42:53,461
I promise to leave you alone,
let you eat after this.

2017
01:42:53,544 --> 01:42:55,046
But before I
announce the winner,

2018
01:42:55,129 --> 01:42:56,756
I would like to
acknowledge our judges,

2019
01:42:56,839 --> 01:42:58,799
our incredibly diverse
group of judges

2020
01:42:58,883 --> 01:43:00,968
who've sacrificed valuable time,

2021
01:43:01,052 --> 01:43:02,678
so we could all
celebrate here tonight.

2022
01:43:02,762 --> 01:43:03,822
So if you put your
hands together,

2023
01:43:03,846 --> 01:43:05,348
they did a fantastic job.

2024
01:43:10,394 --> 01:43:11,395
Okay.

2025
01:43:12,104 --> 01:43:13,272
Without further ado,

2026
01:43:14,607 --> 01:43:17,151
this year's Literary
Award goes to...

2027
01:43:18,361 --> 01:43:19,654
Oh, I knew it.

2028
01:43:19,737 --> 01:43:22,156
By Stagg R. Leigh, <i>Fuck.</i>

2029
01:43:33,459 --> 01:43:35,795
Well, I'm not sure if
Mr. Leigh is going to grace us

2030
01:43:35,878 --> 01:43:37,338
with his presence here tonight.

2031
01:43:37,421 --> 01:43:40,132
He's notoriously
cagey about attention.

2032
01:43:51,394 --> 01:43:53,062
Oh, hold on.

2033
01:43:53,145 --> 01:43:55,773
Oh, okay. I see some business.

2034
01:43:55,856 --> 01:43:59,652
Someone's coming. Oh,
Thelonious Ellison.

2035
01:43:59,735 --> 01:44:01,570
One of our esteemed judges.

2036
01:44:04,615 --> 01:44:06,450
Weirdly walking
toward the stage.

2037
01:44:08,119 --> 01:44:09,704
No idea why.

2038
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,372
Hey.

2039
01:44:11,455 --> 01:44:12,540
What's going on?

2040
01:44:14,208 --> 01:44:15,209
Excuse me.

2041
01:44:16,544 --> 01:44:18,004
Excuse me.

2042
01:44:34,311 --> 01:44:36,022
I have a confession to make.

2043
01:44:41,402 --> 01:44:43,279
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
Smash to black?</i>

2044
01:44:45,781 --> 01:44:47,408
No fucking way, dude.

2045
01:44:47,491 --> 01:44:48,951
What's wrong with that?

2046
01:44:49,035 --> 01:44:51,579
There's no resolution here.
What's he going to say?

2047
01:44:51,662 --> 01:44:53,598
I don't know. I think that's
what's interesting about it.

2048
01:44:53,622 --> 01:44:54,742
No, he should say something.

2049
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:56,208
What did you say?

2050
01:44:56,292 --> 01:44:58,461
Nothing. I walked
out of the ceremony.

2051
01:44:58,544 --> 01:44:59,771
The next day I called you to say

2052
01:44:59,795 --> 01:45:01,172
I wanted to write this movie.

2053
01:45:01,255 --> 01:45:02,548
Well, Monk, the character

2054
01:45:02,631 --> 01:45:03,924
should say something.

2055
01:45:04,008 --> 01:45:06,010
Well, I don't want
him to make some

2056
01:45:06,093 --> 01:45:08,179
grandiose speech
spoon-feeding everyone

2057
01:45:08,262 --> 01:45:09,555
the moral of the story.

2058
01:45:09,638 --> 01:45:11,640
There is no moral.
That's the idea.

2059
01:45:11,724 --> 01:45:12,975
I like the ambiguity.

2060
01:45:13,059 --> 01:45:15,144
Okay, look. You're
a good writer,

2061
01:45:15,227 --> 01:45:17,354
and this is almost there.

2062
01:45:17,438 --> 01:45:19,565
But novels aren't movies, okay?

2063
01:45:19,648 --> 01:45:21,609
Nuance doesn't put
asses in theater seats.

2064
01:45:21,692 --> 01:45:23,152
We need a big
finish. What is this?

2065
01:45:24,278 --> 01:45:26,572
It's the seltzer you asked for.

2066
01:45:26,655 --> 01:45:27,740
Why is it all wet?

2067
01:45:29,241 --> 01:45:30,576
Condensation?

2068
01:45:30,659 --> 01:45:32,328
Condensation. Okay.

2069
01:45:32,411 --> 01:45:34,121
You're a fucking weatherman now.

2070
01:45:34,205 --> 01:45:35,289
You want anything?

2071
01:45:35,372 --> 01:45:36,832
Uh, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

2072
01:45:36,916 --> 01:45:38,042
All right. This is Monk.

2073
01:45:38,125 --> 01:45:41,021
- We're going to make a movie with him if he can get the third act right.
- Nice meeting you.

2074
01:45:41,045 --> 01:45:42,485
- You as well.
- Get me a flat white.

2075
01:45:43,005 --> 01:45:44,840
And, hey, never again.

2076
01:45:47,051 --> 01:45:48,594
All right.

2077
01:45:48,677 --> 01:45:50,797
What other endings you got
in that big brain of yours?

2078
01:45:54,100 --> 01:45:55,267
How about if...

2079
01:45:55,351 --> 01:45:57,812
This year's Literary
Award goes to

2080
01:45:58,729 --> 01:46:01,190
by Stagg R. Leigh, <i>Fuck.</i>

2081
01:46:52,199 --> 01:46:53,951
I'd like to apologize.

2082
01:46:56,537 --> 01:46:58,414
I haven't been myself lately.

2083
01:47:20,019 --> 01:47:21,020
What about that?

2084
01:47:21,770 --> 01:47:22,813
Will she forgive him?

2085
01:47:24,315 --> 01:47:26,108
I don't know.

2086
01:47:26,192 --> 01:47:29,278
The real Coraline won't
return my phone calls.

2087
01:47:29,361 --> 01:47:31,447
Maybe the movie Coraline
is more forgiving.

2088
01:47:34,783 --> 01:47:36,577
No. It's too pat.

2089
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:38,430
Makes the whole thing feel
like a romantic comedy.

2090
01:47:38,454 --> 01:47:40,122
We don't want to make
a romantic comedy.

2091
01:47:40,206 --> 01:47:41,707
We want to make something real.

2092
01:47:42,833 --> 01:47:43,834
Give me something real.

2093
01:47:48,672 --> 01:47:49,798
I mean, we could just...

2094
01:47:51,091 --> 01:47:52,593
Hey, what's going on?

2095
01:47:53,469 --> 01:47:54,470
Excuse me.

2096
01:47:56,847 --> 01:47:57,848
Beat it.

2097
01:48:10,236 --> 01:48:13,280
I have a confession to make.

2098
01:48:13,364 --> 01:48:15,407
Stagg Leigh, on the ground now!

2099
01:48:15,491 --> 01:48:17,159
There he is!

2100
01:48:17,243 --> 01:48:19,078
No, no. I'm not Stagg Leigh.

2101
01:48:20,246 --> 01:48:21,247
He doesn't exist.

2102
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:23,415
I'm Monk. Thelonious Ellison.

2103
01:48:23,499 --> 01:48:25,542
You're a fugitive!
On the ground now!

2104
01:48:25,626 --> 01:48:26,794
No, no, no.

2105
01:48:26,877 --> 01:48:28,254
That was all a
marketing gimmick.

2106
01:48:28,337 --> 01:48:30,172
- It was all a lie.
- He's got a gun!

2107
01:48:30,256 --> 01:48:31,632
No, no! No, no!

2108
01:49:04,081 --> 01:49:05,082
He's dead?

2109
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:07,501
They smoke him?

2110
01:49:11,714 --> 01:49:12,715
It's perfect.

2111
01:49:14,466 --> 01:49:16,176
Yes! That is...

2112
01:49:17,428 --> 01:49:19,013
That is perfect.

2113
01:49:20,139 --> 01:49:22,224
Time to pick out
your tux, my brother.

2114
01:49:22,308 --> 01:49:23,892
We're going to the big show.

2115
01:49:23,976 --> 01:49:26,186
Hey, come transcribe
this. We got it.

2116
01:49:29,648 --> 01:49:30,649
Fuck.

2117
01:49:53,756 --> 01:49:54,757
Hey.

2118
01:49:59,428 --> 01:50:00,429
So?

2119
01:50:02,348 --> 01:50:03,828
They going to make
your movie or what?

2120
01:50:04,183 --> 01:50:05,768
Unfortunately, yes.

2121
01:50:05,851 --> 01:50:07,853
Hey! You know what?

2122
01:50:07,936 --> 01:50:10,731
Good luck finding someone
handsome enough to play me.

2123
01:50:10,814 --> 01:50:12,149

2124
01:50:12,232 --> 01:50:13,233

2125
01:50:14,234 --> 01:50:15,235
Tyler Perry.

2126
01:50:18,072 --> 01:50:19,073
You got me. That's good.

2127
01:50:24,411 --> 01:50:25,537
All right.
