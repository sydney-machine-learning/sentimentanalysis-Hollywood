00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:55,408
Is Barbie Land
like an alternate reality

854
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:57,912
or is it like a place
where your imagination--

855
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:59,013
[all] Yes!

856
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:00,648
Okay.

857
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:03,718
Think of it as a town
in Sweden, Aaron Dinkins.

858
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:05,019
[all] Sweden.

859
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:06,587
Right.

860
00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:08,355
[sighs]

861
00:38:08,388 --> 00:38:09,690
How much do you weigh?

862
00:38:09,724 --> 00:38:11,759
It doesn't matter.
[clears throat]

863
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:13,360
Sounds like a job for the box.

864
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:18,065
No one rests until this doll
is back in a box.

865
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:19,767
[school bell rings]

866
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:20,835
[Barbie] Look, Davy Crockett
Junior High School,

867
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:22,036
just like I saw in my vision.

[Ken] A man on a horse.

869
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:25,438
I've started to get all these
weirdo feelings.

870
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:28,375
Like, I have fear
with no specific object.

871
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:30,343
-What is that?
-It's anxiety.

872
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:32,647
I have it too.
They're just awful at this age.

873
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,381
I feel amazing.
[chuckles]

874
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:36,584
That's because kids don't
take it out on the dads.

875
00:38:36,617 --> 00:38:38,820
[Barbie] She's gotta
be here somewhere.

876
00:38:38,853 --> 00:38:40,087
I need to find her soon.

877
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:41,989
I'm just gonna pop
into the library

878
00:38:42,023 --> 00:38:43,691
and see if I can find
any books on trucks.
[chuckles]

879
00:38:43,724 --> 00:38:45,059
Okay, just don't
get in trouble.

880
00:38:45,092 --> 00:38:47,662
I won't!

Oh, uh,

Sasha can talk to you,

never talk to Sasha.

I'm only your favorite woman
of all time.

00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:37,477
Barbie!

903
00:39:38,713 --> 00:39:41,182
You really think you're Barbie?

904
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:42,884
-Yeah.
-She's crazy.

905
00:39:42,917 --> 00:39:44,752
Do you think she escaped
from like an insane asylum?

906
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:46,621
So you're like "Barbie" Barbie?
Like a professional bimbo?

907
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:48,089
No. Barbie's not a bimbo.

908
00:39:48,122 --> 00:39:50,457
Barbie is a doctor and a lawyer
and a senator

909
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,059
and a Nobel Prize winner.

910
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:53,794
You're a Nobel Prize winner?

911
00:39:53,828 --> 00:39:57,531
Oh. No, not me,
but Barbie is.

912
00:39:57,565 --> 00:39:59,466
Yeah.

913
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:02,603
Aren't you guys gonna thank me
and give me a big hug? [laughs]

914
00:40:04,205 --> 00:40:06,473
For being your favorite toy?

915
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:09,476
We haven't played with Barbie
since we were
like five years old.

916
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,444
Yeah, I hated dolls with hair.

917
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:13,480
I mean, I'd play with Barbie,
but it was, like,
the last resort.

918
00:40:13,514 --> 00:40:14,749
I loved Barbie.

919
00:40:14,782 --> 00:40:16,751
-[clears throat]
-Oh.

920
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:19,053
Anyways, even then,
it was horrible for us.

921
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,154
It was horrible?

922
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:22,990
Why?

923
00:40:23,024 --> 00:40:24,225
-Come on, Sasha.
-Give it to her.

924
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:25,826
Destroy Barbie.

00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,861
[sighs]

926
00:40:26,894 --> 00:40:30,598
Okay, Barbie, let's do this.

927
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:33,834
You've been making women
feel bad about themselves
since you were invented.

928
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:35,703
I think you have that
the wrong way around.

929
00:40:35,736 --> 00:40:38,139
You represent everything wrong
with our culture.

930
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:41,676
Sexualized capitalism,
unrealistic physical ideals...

931
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:44,912
No, no, no. You're describing
something stereotypical.

932
00:40:44,946 --> 00:40:47,915
Barbie is so much more
than that.

933
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:50,151
Look at yourself.

934
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:53,120
Well, I am technically
Stereotypical Barbie.

935
00:40:53,154 --> 00:40:55,756
You set the feminist movement
back 50 years.

936
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,825
You destroy
girls' innate sense of worth

937
00:40:57,858 --> 00:40:59,527
and you are killing the planet

938
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,562
with your glorification
of rampant consumerism.

939
00:41:01,595 --> 00:41:05,766
No, I'm supposed to help you
and make you happy
and powerful.

940
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,635
Oh, I am powerful.

941
00:41:07,668 --> 00:41:09,770
And until you showed up here
and declared yourself Barbie,

942
00:41:09,804 --> 00:41:12,106
I hadn't thought about you
in years, you fascist!

943
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,112
Oh. Um...

944
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:20,614
Okay.

945
00:41:20,648 --> 00:41:23,017
It's happening again.
[laughing] I have to--

946
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,885
Will you excuse me?

947
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:27,154
It was really nice
talking to you.

948
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:35,863
They never listen.

949
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,579
Excuse me, sir,
do you have the time?

950
00:41:52,313 --> 00:41:53,814
You respect me.

951
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:55,850
Sorry, no,
do you know what time it is?

952
00:41:56,684 --> 00:41:58,119
No, I do not.

953
00:41:58,152 --> 00:41:59,720
[laughs]

954
00:41:59,754 --> 00:42:01,022
Okay.

955
00:42:01,055 --> 00:42:02,623
Why didn't Barbie tell me
about patriarchy,

956
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:03,991
which, to my understanding,

957
00:42:04,025 --> 00:42:06,627
is where men and horses
run everything?

958
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,062
Sure.

959
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:09,897
I shall seek my fortune there.

960
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,933
All right. So...

961
00:42:12,967 --> 00:42:15,669
I'll take a high-level,
high-paying job
with influence, please.

962
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:16,971
Okay, you'll need
at least an MBA.

963
00:42:17,004 --> 00:42:18,606
And a lot of our people
have PhDs.

964
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,074
Isn't being a man enough?

965
00:42:20,107 --> 00:42:21,842
Actually, right now,
it's kind of the opposite.

966
00:42:21,876 --> 00:42:24,779
You guys are clearly not doing
patriarchy very well.

967
00:42:24,812 --> 00:42:27,848
[laughing] No!
No. We're, uh...

968
00:42:27,882 --> 00:42:31,252
We're doing it well, yeah.
We just... hide it better now.

969
00:42:31,285 --> 00:42:33,187
Oh.

970
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,757
No, I won't let you do
just one appendectomy.

971
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:38,159
-But I'm a man.
-But not a doctor.

972
00:42:38,192 --> 00:42:39,894
-Please?
-No.

973
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:41,328
-Can I talk to a doctor?
-You are talking to a doctor.

974
00:42:41,362 --> 00:42:42,897
-Can you get me a coffee?
-No.

975
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:43,964
-And I need a clicky pen.
-No.

976
00:42:43,998 --> 00:42:45,066
-And a white coat.
-No.

977
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:46,734
-And a sharp thing.
-No.

978
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:48,035
-There he is. Doctor!
-Somebody get security.

979
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:50,237
I'd like to apply
for your job of beach.

980
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:51,906
So, you want to be a lifeguard?

981
00:42:51,939 --> 00:42:54,375
Oh. I'm not trained
to go over there.

982
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:56,710
I'm trained to stand
confidently right here.

983
00:42:56,744 --> 00:42:58,345
There's nobody in danger here.

984
00:42:58,379 --> 00:43:00,781
And even if there were,
I'm not trained to save them.

985
00:43:00,815 --> 00:43:02,083
-[chuckles]
-Then I can't hire you.

986
00:43:02,116 --> 00:43:04,018
I can't even beach here!

987
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:08,222
[sobbing]

988
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:10,724
She thinks I'm a fascist?

989
00:43:10,758 --> 00:43:14,862
I don't control the railways
or the flow of commerce.

990
00:43:15,696 --> 00:43:17,231
[sobs]

991
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:18,666
-There you are.
-Oh, no.

992
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:20,367
That went terrible.

993
00:43:20,401 --> 00:43:23,904
I need to find somewhere where
I can start patriarchy fresh.

994
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:28,776
Miss Barbie?

995
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:30,144
[sniffling] It's just Barbie.

996
00:43:30,177 --> 00:43:31,912
We're gonna need you
to come with us.

997
00:43:31,946 --> 00:43:33,914
Oh.

998
00:43:33,948 --> 00:43:35,716
-Who are you?
-We're Mattel.

999
00:43:35,749 --> 00:43:37,418
-Mattel?
-Mattel.

1000
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:39,220
Oh, thank goodness!

1001
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:41,255
I've gotta talk
to somebody in charge.

1002
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:42,857
Everything is backwards here.

1003
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,725
Men look at me
like I'm an object.

1004
00:43:44,758 --> 00:43:46,327
Girls hate me.

1005
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,662
Everyone thinks I'm crazy,
and I keep getting arrested.

1006
00:43:48,696 --> 00:43:49,930
Need you to step this way,
ma'am.

1007
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:51,699
I also just learned to cry.

1008
00:43:51,732 --> 00:43:53,801
First, I got one tear
and then I got a whole bunch.

1009
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:55,402
What do I do?
Do I follow Barbie

1010
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:58,172
into that scary unmarked
black truck car?

1011
00:43:58,205 --> 00:44:01,075
A truck car
I'd like to have, actually.

1012
00:44:01,108 --> 00:44:04,078
You're right, she's fine.
It's Mattel.

1013
00:44:04,111 --> 00:44:06,247
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-I know.

1014
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,149
I'll go back to Barbie Land,
and I'll tell the Kens
what I've learned.

1015
00:44:08,182 --> 00:44:09,383
Oh, it's going to be beautiful!

1016
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:10,384
[chuckles]

1017
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:11,986
Okay.

1018
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:13,220
-Back to Barbie Land.
-Let's go that way.

1019
00:44:14,755 --> 00:44:16,690
-Hi, Bunny Boo-Boo.
-Don't call me that.

1020
00:44:16,724 --> 00:44:19,293
Sorry. I'm off early
because of a crisis at work,

1021
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:22,096
but I thought we could
go get some soft serve.

1022
00:44:22,129 --> 00:44:24,732
Thank God
they arrested that nutjob.

1023
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:25,933
Um, um...

1024
00:44:25,966 --> 00:44:28,135

-[Writer Barbie] Ken!
-No! Get back.

1691
01:11:53,681 --> 01:11:54,816
-[Writer Barbie] Ken. Oh. Oh!
-[shushing]

1692
01:11:58,085 --> 01:12:00,087
-[Sasha's mom] Hello?
-Hmm?

1693
01:12:00,121 --> 01:12:02,389
-Humans. We're fine.
-[Barbies] Ah.

1694
01:12:02,422 --> 01:12:04,457
-And Allan.
-[Barbies] Hmm.

1695
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:07,094
Come into my Weirdhouse.
Hi! I'm Weird Barbie.

1696
01:12:07,128 --> 01:12:08,896
I'm in the splits,
I have a funky haircut,

1697
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:10,363
and I smell like basement.

1698
01:12:10,397 --> 01:12:12,867
Oh, my God.
I had a Weird Barbie.

1699
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:16,003
-Yeah, you did.
-You make them weird
by playing too hard.

1700
01:12:16,037 --> 01:12:17,805
That's cool.

1701
01:12:17,839 --> 01:12:19,740
[gasps] That's Sugar Daddy Ken.
And Earring Magic Ken.

1702
01:12:19,774 --> 01:12:21,374
Mattel discontinued them.

1703
01:12:21,408 --> 01:12:22,577
-Sugar Daddy?
-No, no, no.

1704
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:23,845
I'm not a sugar daddy.

1705
01:12:23,878 --> 01:12:26,479
This is Sugar,
and I'm her daddy.

1706
01:12:26,514 --> 01:12:28,783
And I have an earring.
A magic earring.

1707
01:12:28,816 --> 01:12:30,651
These were actual Kens.

1708
01:12:30,685 --> 01:12:33,120
[gasps] More
discontinued Barbies.

1709
01:12:33,154 --> 01:12:35,756
Growing Up Skipper? May I?

1710
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:36,924
-Okay.
-[Sasha's mom] Watch this.

1711
01:12:36,958 --> 01:12:38,391
[air hisses]

1712
01:12:38,425 --> 01:12:40,728
-Her boobs grow.
-Why would they do that?

1713
01:12:40,761 --> 01:12:42,697
[Sasha's mom]
And Barbie Video Girl.

1714
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:45,833
I have a TV in my back.
You know whose dream that is?

1715
01:12:45,867 --> 01:12:48,102
Nobody. Nobody's dream.

1716
01:12:48,135 --> 01:12:50,037
And that's Barbie Barbie,
of course.

1717
01:12:50,071 --> 01:12:52,405
She's not dead. She's just
having an existential crisis.

1718
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:53,841
[Sasha's mom] Okay, come on.

1719
01:12:55,176 --> 01:12:56,376
Hey.

1720
01:12:57,178 --> 01:12:58,079
What's wrong?

1721
01:13:02,183 --> 01:13:05,920
[crying] I'm not
pretty anymore.

1722
01:13:07,688 --> 01:13:09,523
What? You're so pretty.

1723
01:13:09,557 --> 01:13:13,060
I'm not
Stereotypical Barbie pretty.

01:13:17,098 --> 01:13:19,567
But you're beautiful.

1728
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,135
It's not just that. I'm not...

1729
01:13:23,037 --> 01:13:24,805
smart enough to be interesting.

1730
01:13:24,839 --> 01:13:27,008
You're so smart.

1731
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:29,043

I've never flown a plane.

I'm not the president.

1733
01:13:33,648 --> 01:13:35,683
No one on the Supreme Court
is me.

1734
01:13:37,752 --> 01:13:42,455
I'm not good enough
for anything.

1735
01:13:45,593 --> 01:13:46,493
[crying softly]

1736
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:51,866
It is literally impossible
to be a woman.

1737
01:13:53,668 --> 01:13:57,104
You are so beautiful
and so smart,

1738
01:13:57,138 --> 01:14:00,741
and it kills me that you don't
think you're good enough.

1739
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:05,913
Like we have to always
be extraordinary.

1740
01:14:05,947 --> 01:14:09,951
But somehow,
we're always doing it wrong.

1741
01:14:11,686 --> 01:14:12,920
[sighs]

1742
01:14:12,954 --> 01:14:14,689
You have to be thin
but not too thin,

1743
01:14:14,722 --> 01:14:16,857
and you can never say
you want to be thin.

1744
01:14:16,891 --> 01:14:18,993
You have to say
you want to be healthy,

1745
01:14:19,026 --> 01:14:22,697
but also you have to be thin.

1746
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:25,599
You have to have money,
but you can't ask for money

1747
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:27,134
because that's crass.

1748
01:14:28,169 --> 01:14:29,770
[sighs]

1749
01:14:29,804 --> 01:14:31,739
You have to be a boss
but you can't be mean.

1750
01:14:31,772 --> 01:14:34,575
You have to lead,
but you can't squash
other people's ideas.

1751
01:14:34,608 --> 01:14:36,077
You're supposed to love
being a mother,

1752
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:38,279
but don't talk about your kids
all the damn time.

1753
01:14:38,312 --> 01:14:40,047
You have to be
a career woman

1754
01:14:40,081 --> 01:14:43,517
but also always
be looking out
for other people.

1755
01:14:43,551 --> 01:14:46,654
You have to answer for men's
bad behavior, which is insane,

1756
01:14:46,687 --> 01:14:49,623
but if you point that out,
you're accused of complaining.

1757
01:14:49,657 --> 01:14:52,093
You're supposed to stay pretty
for men but not so pretty

1758
01:14:52,126 --> 01:14:53,594
that you tempt them too much

1759
01:14:53,627 --> 01:14:55,129
or that you threaten
other women

1760
01:14:55,162 --> 01:14:56,897
because you're supposed to be
a part of the sisterhood

1761
01:14:56,931 --> 01:14:58,699
but always stand out.

1762
01:14:58,733 --> 01:15:01,235
And always be grateful.

1763
01:15:01,268 --> 01:15:03,137
But never forget
that the system is rigged,

1764
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:04,772
so find a way
to acknowledge that

1765
01:15:04,805 --> 01:15:06,841
but also always be grateful.

1766
01:15:06,874 --> 01:15:08,843
You have to never get old,

1767
01:15:08,876 --> 01:15:11,779
never be rude,
never show off,

1768
01:15:11,812 --> 01:15:14,015
never be selfish,
never fall down,

1769
01:15:14,048 --> 01:15:16,017
never fail, never show fear,

1770
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:17,918
never get out of line.

1771
01:15:17,952 --> 01:15:20,621
It's too hard,
it's too contradictory,

1772
01:15:20,654 --> 01:15:23,657
and nobody gives you a medal
or says thank you.

1773
01:15:23,691 --> 01:15:25,092
And it turns out, in fact,

1774
01:15:25,126 --> 01:15:26,293
that not only
are you doing everything wrong

1775
01:15:26,327 --> 01:15:28,896
but also
everything is your fault.

1776
01:15:30,998 --> 01:15:31,932
[sighs]

1777
01:15:33,968 --> 01:15:37,638
I'm just so tired
of watching myself

1778
01:15:37,671 --> 01:15:41,575
and every single other woman

1779
01:15:41,609 --> 01:15:45,913
tie herself into knots
so that people will like us.

1780
01:15:49,283 --> 01:15:51,152
And if all of that

1781
01:15:52,153 --> 01:15:54,955
is also true for a doll

1782
01:15:56,223 --> 01:16:00,227
just representing a woman...

1783
01:16:02,863 --> 01:16:05,332
then I don't even know.

1784
01:16:11,705 --> 01:16:12,606
Wait.

1785
01:16:13,941 --> 01:16:16,143
I did write a book.

1786
01:16:16,177 --> 01:16:18,245
It's like I've been in a dream,

1787
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:21,282
where I was somehow
really invested

1788
01:16:21,315 --> 01:16:24,118
in the Zack Snyder cut
of <i>Justice League.</i>

1789
01:16:25,986 --> 01:16:28,923
But what you said
broke me out of it.

1790
01:16:29,857 --> 01:16:30,791
Really?

1791
01:16:30,825 --> 01:16:31,926
Yeah.

1792
01:16:31,959 --> 01:16:33,894
You're back. She's back.

1793
01:16:33,928 --> 01:16:36,163
By giving voice
to the cognitive
dissonance required

1794
01:16:36,197 --> 01:16:37,865
to be a woman
under the patriarchy,

1795
01:16:37,898 --> 01:16:39,967
-you robbed it of its power.
-Yes.

1796
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:42,970
Wow, I just said all of that.

1797
01:16:43,003 --> 01:16:45,639
Hell, yes, White Savior Barbie!

1798
01:16:45,673 --> 01:16:48,909
No, it was your mom.
Your mom did the saving.

1799
01:16:48,943 --> 01:16:50,978
We have to stop the Kens.

1800
01:16:51,011 --> 01:16:53,247
And you need to say
all of those things
to the other Barbies.

1801
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,748
-That's the key.
-Got it.

1802
01:16:54,782 --> 01:16:56,016
But how are we gonna
get the Barbies

1803
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:57,685
away from their Kens?

1804
01:16:57,718 --> 01:16:59,120
We have experience
with a world like this one.

1805
01:16:59,153 --> 01:17:00,721
Do you have a map
of Barbie Land?

1806
01:17:00,754 --> 01:17:02,756
What do you think?

1807
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:03,757
[whirring]

1808
01:17:05,459 --> 01:17:07,128
-Wow.
-[Weird Barbie] Thanks.
I built it.

1809
01:17:07,161 --> 01:17:08,362
Okay, here's the deal.

1810
01:17:08,395 --> 01:17:10,064
It's not just about
how they see us,

1811
01:17:10,097 --> 01:17:11,866
it's about
how they see themselves.

1812
01:17:11,899 --> 01:17:14,835
Ken Land contains the seeds
of its own destruction.

1813
01:17:14,869 --> 01:17:17,805
First we have to get
the Barbies
away from their Kens.

1814
01:17:17,838 --> 01:17:21,041
We could use a decoy Barbie
who pretends to be brainwashed.

1815
01:17:21,075 --> 01:17:22,309
-That should be you.
-Cool.

<i>And when their guard is down,</i>
<i>you take the power back.</i>

Oh! Photoshop is so hard!

I just don't understand
how to use the Select tool.

1827
01:17:54,341 --> 01:17:56,210
Honey, you can only use
the Select tool

1828
01:17:56,243 --> 01:17:57,811
if the layer is highlighted.

1829

[Sasha's mom] Just listen.

01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,202
You have to be their mommies

01:18:53,033 --> 01:18:55,202
This movie is a rich blend
of Coppola's aesthetic genius

1857
01:18:55,236 --> 01:18:56,870
and a triumph for Robert Evans

1858
01:18:56,904 --> 01:18:58,372
and the architecture
of the '70s studio system.

1859
01:18:58,405 --> 01:18:59,840
[President Barbie] Can you
start the movie over

1860
01:18:59,873 --> 01:19:01,242
and just talk
through the whole thing?

1861
01:19:01,275 --> 01:19:03,143
You have to find a way
to reject men's advances

1862
01:19:03,177 --> 01:19:04,845
without damaging their egos.

1863
01:19:04,878 --> 01:19:06,247
Because if you say yes to them,
you're a tramp,

1864
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,215
but if you say no to them,
you're a prude.

I just have all my money
in a savings account.

1870
01:19:17,525 --> 01:19:19,193
That's totally wrong.
You need treasury bonds,

1871
01:19:19,226 --> 01:19:20,427

1872

Oh, sweetheart, you are so cute
when you're confused.

1874

But no, not music.

Certificate of Deposit.

to turn the Kens
against each other.

1905

Now that they think
they have power over you,

1906
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:41,909
you make them question whether
they have enough power

There is no just "Ken."

2196
01:34:34,408 --> 01:34:36,343
That's why I was created.

2197
01:34:36,377 --> 01:34:38,045
I only exist

2198
01:34:39,914 --> 01:34:41,849
within the warmth of your gaze.

2199
01:34:43,083 --> 01:34:45,386
Without it,

2200
01:34:45,419 --> 01:34:49,223
I'm just another blond guy
who can't do flips.

[gasping]

2204
01:34:59,433 --> 01:35:03,737
Maybe it's time
to discover who Ken is.

2205
01:35:03,771 --> 01:35:06,073
-Okay. I think I get it now.
-Okay. [chuckles]

2206
01:35:06,106 --> 01:35:09,476
No, no, no!
This isn't the answer.

-[crowd gasps]

2208
01:35:12,046 --> 01:35:13,314
[Ken] I feel so stupid.

2209
01:35:13,347 --> 01:35:14,882
-[Pompadour Ken] No.
-[Tall Ken] No.

2210
01:35:14,915 --> 01:35:17,251
-[crying] I look so stupid.
-[Barbies] Yeah.

2211
01:35:17,284 --> 01:35:19,820
I look so stupid!

2212
01:35:19,853 --> 01:35:23,090
-No! [crying]
-So cool. You look so cool.

2213
01:35:23,123 --> 01:35:25,492
Okay. Ken,
you have to figure out

2214
01:35:25,527 --> 01:35:27,328
who you are without me.

2215
01:35:28,195 --> 01:35:30,097
[sighs] Why?

2216
01:35:30,130 --> 01:35:31,966
You're not your girlfriend.

2217
01:35:31,999 --> 01:35:34,868
You're not your house,
you're not your mink.

2218
01:35:34,902 --> 01:35:36,837
-Beach?
-[Barbie] Nope.

2219
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:38,872
You're not even beach.

2220
01:35:38,906 --> 01:35:42,977
Maybe all the things
that you thought made you you

2221
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:46,981
aren't... really you.

2222
01:35:51,819 --> 01:35:54,154
Maybe it's Barbie and...

2223
01:35:56,290 --> 01:35:57,891
it's Ken.

2224
01:36:01,095 --> 01:36:04,198
Ken is...

2225
01:36:06,033 --> 01:36:06,934
me?

2226
01:36:06,967 --> 01:36:08,135
Yes.

2227
01:36:08,168 --> 01:36:10,971
Ken is me!

2228
01:36:12,206 --> 01:36:13,941
And I'm Barbie.

[soft uplifting music playing]

[Ken laughs]

2235
01:36:24,485 --> 01:36:25,520
I don't even care
about being Ken anymore.

2236
01:36:25,553 --> 01:36:26,854
I just miss my friend Barbie!

2237
01:36:26,887 --> 01:36:28,422
-That's cool!
-Barbie!

[dramatic musical sting]

01:36:35,530 --> 01:36:38,165
I want you to have it.

2243
01:36:38,198 --> 01:36:40,301
Aw. That's nice.

[sentimental music playing]

We were only fighting
because we didn't know
who we were.

01:36:52,946 --> 01:36:57,484
Ken is me!

Ken is right.

2250
01:37:07,928 --> 01:37:10,397
It's just so hard
to be a leader.

2251
01:37:10,431 --> 01:37:12,299
-You know?
-That's my boss.

2252
01:37:12,333 --> 01:37:14,536
It's... [screams] Oh.

2253
01:37:14,569 --> 01:37:16,538
Midge, gosh.

2254
01:37:16,571 --> 01:37:18,339
I thought we discontinued her.

[panting]

2256
01:37:20,474 --> 01:37:23,143
Look,
do you know how many times

2257
01:37:23,177 --> 01:37:26,480
I've wanted to stand up
in a board meeting
and just say,

2258
01:37:26,514 --> 01:37:28,550
"Can we just
tickle each other?"

2259
01:37:28,583 --> 01:37:30,284
-Really?
-Let's have a company retreat

2260
01:37:30,317 --> 01:37:32,052
-and just tickle each other.
-[executives laughing]

Don't hug me.

01:37:41,261 --> 01:37:42,329
[sighs]

2265
01:37:43,397 --> 01:37:45,432
But thanks to the Barbies,

2266
01:37:45,466 --> 01:37:48,969
I, too, can now relieve
myself of this heavy
existential burden

2267
01:37:49,002 --> 01:37:53,006
while holding on to
the very real title of CEO.

2268
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,510
And we can restore
everything in Barbie Land

2269
01:37:55,543 --> 01:37:57,277
to exactly the way it was.

2270
01:37:57,311 --> 01:38:00,981
-Mister Mattel, I just--
-Please. Call me Mother.

No, thank you.

2272
01:38:02,383 --> 01:38:04,151
I don't think
that things should go back

2273
01:38:04,184 --> 01:38:05,653
to the way that they were.

2274
01:38:05,687 --> 01:38:09,256
No Barbie or Ken should be
living in the shadows.

2275
01:38:09,289 --> 01:38:10,592
Or Allan.

2276
01:38:11,559 --> 01:38:12,960

-Me?

-Yeah.
-Oh. Hello.

2278
01:38:14,696 --> 01:38:16,096
I just want to say,

2279
01:38:16,130 --> 01:38:17,398
I'm sorry
we called you Weird Barbie

2280
01:38:17,431 --> 01:38:19,066
behind your back
and also to your face.

2281
01:38:19,099 --> 01:38:21,335
That's okay. I'm owning it.

2282
01:38:21,368 --> 01:38:23,237
Would you like a job
in my cabinet?

2283
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:25,339
May I please have sanitation?

2284
01:38:26,407 --> 01:38:28,008
It's yours.

01:38:28,041 --> 01:38:29,577
-Yeah, thank you.
-[President Barbie] All right.

2286
01:38:29,611 --> 01:38:31,311
-Madam President.
-Oh.

2287
01:38:31,345 --> 01:38:34,281
Please, may the Kens have
one Supreme Court Justice?

2288
01:38:34,314 --> 01:38:38,385
Oh, I can't do that.
But maybe a lower circuit
court judgeship.

2289
01:38:38,419 --> 01:38:40,354
We accept.
As long as we can wear robes.

Okay,
what about Ordinary Barbie?

2299
01:39:00,642 --> 01:39:03,645
She's not extraordinary.
She's not president
of anything,

2300
01:39:03,678 --> 01:39:05,045
or maybe she is.

2301
01:39:05,078 --> 01:39:07,014
Maybe she's a mom.
Maybe she's not.

2302
01:39:07,047 --> 01:39:10,317
Because it's okay
to just want to be a mom,

2303
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:12,620
or to wanna be president
or a mom who is president.

2304
01:39:12,654 --> 01:39:14,421
Or not a mom
who's also not president.

2305
01:39:14,455 --> 01:39:16,558
She just has a flattering top,

2306
01:39:16,591 --> 01:39:18,091
and she wants
to get through the day

2307
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:20,662
feeling kinda good
about herself.

2308
01:39:23,063 --> 01:39:25,299
That's a terrible idea.

Yeah,
that's going to make money.

I love it. Fantastic.

-Great.
-Cool.

-Yes.

I think we're good, right?

2316
01:39:37,612 --> 01:39:40,447
to close the portal
between our two worlds.

where I belong anymore.

always the point.

-What?

[Ruth] You guys,

01:40:45,412 --> 01:40:48,282
you think the lady who invented
Barbie looks like Barbie?

I'm a five-foot-nothing grandma

...and tax evasion issues.

01:40:54,354 --> 01:40:56,791
Nobody looks like Barbie,

2347

except, of course, Barbie.
Take a bow, honey.

2348
01:41:02,429 --> 01:41:05,198
I don't really feel
like Barbie anymore.

2349
01:41:09,303 --> 01:41:11,138
Come, walk with me.

2350
01:41:14,341 --> 01:41:15,710
[solemn music playing]

2351
01:41:31,258 --> 01:41:32,292
Thank you.

Thank you, Barbie.

Thank you.

2354
01:41:48,475 --> 01:41:50,477
I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to do now.

2355
01:41:50,511 --> 01:41:53,180
I've always been
Stereotypical Barbie,

2356
01:41:53,213 --> 01:41:56,517
and I don't think I'm really
good at anything else.

2357
01:41:56,551 --> 01:41:58,720
You saved Barbie Land
from patriarchy.

2358
01:41:58,753 --> 01:42:01,522
That was very much
a group effort.

2359
01:42:01,556 --> 01:42:04,491
And you helped that mother
and daughter connect.

2360
01:42:04,525 --> 01:42:06,159
They really helped each other.

2361
01:42:07,528 --> 01:42:09,864
Maybe
you're Self-Effacing Barbie?

2362
01:42:11,799 --> 01:42:13,668
Maybe I'm not Barbie anymore.

2363
01:42:22,944 --> 01:42:26,781
You understand that humans
only have one ending.

2364
01:42:26,814 --> 01:42:31,218
Ideas live forever,
humans not so much.

2365
01:42:31,251 --> 01:42:32,587
