1
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,642
There is nothing a father
wouldn't do for his son.

2
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,311
Your mother
never understood this.

3
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,064
She looked at you
and saw a monster.

4
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,108
I saw potential.

5
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:09,778
When a bully took your money,
you took his eye.

6
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:13,448
When they called you crazy,
you took their tongues.

7
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,076
But I brought you here today.

8
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,744
Was it generosity?

9
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,871
Love?

10
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,081
No.

11
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,750
It's so what I built
doesn't die with me.

12
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,585
So my legacy can live on,

13
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,797
because a father and his son
is everything.

14
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,300
I have a job that I can
only trust with one man.

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,718
You.

16
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,679
My most ruthless soldiers
were watching our cash houses,

17
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,849
and they let this Dominic
Toretto burn what is mine.

18
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,600
I'll kill Dominic Toretto.

19
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,020
I'll kill 'em all.

20
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,647
Kill them?
You'd show them mercy?

21
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,190
No, my son.

22
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,528
When suffering is owed,
never accept death as a payment.

23
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,992
Make Toretto suffer.

24
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,053
Now the work begins.

25
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,804
And in there,

26
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,558
today we'll put our family
on a path to real power.

27
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,770
Let's get started.

28
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,601
What's
happening?

29
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,353
They are
taking the vault!

30
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,571
They are taking
the vault!

31
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,155
WHAT?

32
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:17,989
The
vault!

33
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,508
Shit!

34
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,061
Stay on them.

35
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,369
They can't
outrun us on the bridge.

36
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,539
Hey, there's too many of them!

37
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,458
-We're not gonna make it.
-You're right. We aren't.

38
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,543
-You are.
-No, I'm not leaving you.

39
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,295
Now, you stick with the plan.

40
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,047
It was always the plan.

41
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,851
They have no
way out.

42
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,861
What is
he doing?

43
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,558
Get him.

56
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,352
You had it.

57
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,562
I didn't have it.

58
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,981
B, no one starts
at the finish line.

59
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,192
You got to have faith.

60
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,860
Remember today's lesson.

61
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,780
Find the line,

62
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,782
feel the car,

63
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,158
and let it fly.

64
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,243
-It's okay to be afraid.

65
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,454
Sometimes fear can be
the best teacher.

66
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,955
I wasn't scared.

67
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,958
-Everyone gets scared, son.
-You don't.

68
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,752
You're not afraid of anything.

69
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,839
We better hurry.

70
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,591
-Great-Grandma just flew in.

71
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,052
And she's making
her famous maduros.

72
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,763
We got to get to those
before Uncle Roman does.

73
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,390
Now, that's something
to be afraid of.

80
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,701
You have been dead.

81
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,536
-It's time to get you living.
-Told you guys,

82
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,537
I don't need that.

83
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,498
There, profile done.

84
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,916
You're welcome.

85
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,501
Now, you give it
about three, four days...

86
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,752
-It never happens instantly.

87
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,504
-Wait, what?
-Hmm.

88
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,797
Wow.

89
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,215
Let me see
your profile picture again.

90
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,258
He must have
put a filter on there.

91
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,926
What are you guys looking at?

92
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,428
-Oh, wait. No, no, no, no.
-They're just video games, man.

93
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,762
-H-H-Hold on, man.
-Just videos, man.

94
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,972
Can I sit next to you?

95
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:34,764
-Boy nosy.
-You drifting yet?

96
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,141
I am.

97
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:39,144
You should've seen us.
It was so cool, Mom.

98
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,603
Hey!

99
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,604
¡Oye, familia!

100
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,189
I am starving!

101
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,774
-Come on.

102
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,902
I also want a hug from
every single person in--

103
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,362
Oh.

104
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,030
-Ah.
-You see the line?

105
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,741
We're all waiting in line
for this love, abuelita.

106
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,909
-Oh, yeah.
-Wait till you taste this.

107
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,994
It's really good.

108
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,829
I put myself out for this one.

109
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,205
-Oh.

110
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,085
Okay, everybody pipe down,
please.

111
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,962
Abuelita would like
to say something.

112
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,549
-Piping and downing, please.

113
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,927
As I look out
at this wonderful family,

114
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:18,266
I am filled with so much pride.

115
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,644
The kind of pride that my son--
your father--

116
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,480
would have enjoyed
if he were here.

117
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,484
I know that this road
has been very hard

118
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,320
and also not fair.

119
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,907
And yet here you are,

120
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,409
despite all of the odds,

121
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,745
building this magnificent

122
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,830
-leg...

123
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,216
It is a legacy that will go on
for generations.

124
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,842
No one can take it away.

125
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,719
Not now.

126
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,179
Not ever.

127
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,140
-Yeah!

128
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,350
To familia.

129
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,186
-Familia.

130
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,355
Siempre. Always.

132
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,902
Hey, these new Nikes, man.
Stop playing! Goddamn...

133
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,446
Come on, Roman.
The agency put you in charge,

134
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,614
and you said I get to drive.

135
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,449
See, what I really need

136
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,617
is I need your brain.

137
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,620
Words Roman Pearce
has never said.

138
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,790
So talk me through it again.
I need details.

139
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,459
Yeah, the agency got a tip on
some stolen military hardware.

140
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,586
Tomorrow, a next-gen
quantum computer chip

141
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,713
will be transported
through the streets of Rome,

142
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,006
and they need us to steal it.

143
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,842
I checked Roman's intel.

144
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:34,884
It's legit.

145
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:35,969
Of course it's legit.

146
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,178
We're talking 'bout Rome.

147
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,472
Rome. Roman.

148
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,890
Come on, man.

149
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,559
That's like planning a heist
in my backyard.

150
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,936
Only thing you know about Rome
is "ro-man" noodles.

151
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,896
One thing
you didn't explain to us is:

152
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,398
Why the hell
do we need a RC car,

153
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,860
a gold Lamborghini
and 12 tanks of laughing gas?

154
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,278
Yes, I'm in,
'cause you are definitely

155
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,821
going to need
all the brains you can get.

156
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,239
You up to something.

157
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,866
-Hey, Rome... -
Don't talk to me, man.

158
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,284
Don't talk to me.

159
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,702
-All right.
-You know what?

160
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:03,997
The disrespect
is gon' have to stop.

161
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,832
Now!

162
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,669
That's just my--
You know what I'm saying?

163
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,964
Me just, you know,
practicing my leadership voice.

164
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,675
I see what's going on.

165
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,594
Tej, you think you slick, bro.

166
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,761
Look at you.

167
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,096
Spying on me.

168
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,973
What's up with
this old boat anchor?

169
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,099
No fuel injection.

170
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,434
I mean, I'd expect
something bigger

171
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,727
and better from you, Dom.

172
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,228
Little B and I
are building it together.

173
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:30,106
The carburetor
forces him to listen.

174
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,608
That's the problem nowadays.

175
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,276
-Nobody listens anymore.
-Well, you better watch out.

176
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,237
Little man's gonna be
a better wrench than any of us

177
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,530
by the time he's 12.

178
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,198
I mean, that's the whole point,
isn't it?

179
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,660
Pass it down.

180
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,954
Each generation
better than the last.

181
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,582
That's true.

182
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,958
That's fatherhood.

183
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,212
Come a long way from
the two of us popping gas trucks

184
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,381
-in the D.R., huh?
-We sure did.

185
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,967
Those were some tough times.

186
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,094
Those were some great times.

187
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,686
Oh, you...
Y-Y'all was in a meeting?

188
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,480
-I'm sorry.

189
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,106
I-I ain't want
to interrupt y'all.

190
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,650
Han, let's go, man.

191
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,819
Roman asked if he could
lead this mission.

192
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,571
How could I tell him no?

193
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,574
But you know I can't let them
go to Rome without you.

194
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,952
Los bandoleros for life.

195
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,954
Lo bandolero for life.

196
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,364
You honor his name.

197
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,758
Hold us in your heart...

198
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,555
...and you will never
lose your way.

199
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,287
You will be better than me.

200
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,261
What are you looking at?

201
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,559
You.

203
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,232
-Kid's asleep.
-Mm-hmm.

205
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,361
How do you get more beautiful?

207
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,493
-Is it here yet?

208
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,328
No.

209
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,831
-It'll come when the time
is right. -Mm.

217
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,306
You know, when we were
in the car today...

218
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,063
...B said, "Daddy,

219
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,273
you're never afraid."

220
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,068
But I am.

221
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,116
I'm afraid of losing a son.

222
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,788
Or a wife.

223
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,253
That's not gonna happen again.

224
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,689
You can keep your eyes
on that rearview all you want.

225
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,357
But you know what you miss?

226
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,859
What?

227
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,360
Eternity

228
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,281
in this moment.

229
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,853
I'm as surprised as you are.

230
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:25,735
I've imagined killing you
a thousand times.

231
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:29,989
Last time, there was six inches
of reinforced glass,

232
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,116
-guns...
- No!

233
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,159
...guards.

234
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,119
I couldn't reach you then.

235
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,913
Now I can.

236
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,998
You're gonna want to hear
my last words.

237
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,958
-Dom! -
- No!

238
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:51,302
Did you hear Elena's last words

239
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,095
before you killed her?

240
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,766
Then don't you think I'd have a
goddamn good reason to be here?

241
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,143
Maybe the only reason
that's ever mattered to you.

242
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,272
Little B.

243
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,942
Wake up, sweetie.

244
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,902
We have an unwanted guest.

245
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,403
You know what to do.

246
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,084
What is it that you want?

247
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,335
Speak.

248
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:33,886
I met the devil tonight.

249
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,349
Honestly, I always thought
it was me.

250
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,601
So that was
kind of disappointing.

251
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,565
He came to my door.

252
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,656
He let himself in.

253
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,743
They say
when you're facing death,

254
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:01,414
your life flashes
before your eyes.

255
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,207
Are they right?

256
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,256
I'd start with who you are.

257
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,550
A question most can't answer
in a lifetime.

258
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,843
You have three seconds.

259
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,472
Before you bleed out
on my couch,

260
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,850
you might want to explain
why you're here.

261
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,686
I'm here

262
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:26,063
because the enemy

263
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,858
of my enemy

264
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:29,859
is you.

265
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,028
I am a man with

266
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,155
no name.

267
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,032
Heir to nothing.

268
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,868
And I'm here for
the same reasons you are.

269
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,745
Dominic Toretto.

270
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,204
You want to kill Dom?

271
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,123
Line's around the block.

272
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,958
No, no, no.

273
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:50,463
Never accept death
when suffering is owed.

274
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,923
But I need your help.

275
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,634
Your toys and your tech.

276
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,219
All your boys.

277
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,555
'Cause you're either with me
or you're...

278
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,350
I don't play well with others.

279
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,310
Then you'll have to watch
who you love most die.

280
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,936
You're looking at
who I love most.

281
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:09,065
You thought you could use
my own move against me?

282
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,400
I wasn't talking to you.

283
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,027
I was talking to Zeke.

284
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,113
Amir.

285
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,825
Kevin's dad.

286
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,581
Who could it be?

287
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,634
Cute kids.

288
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,932
Ooh.

289
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,938
They all had something to take

290
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,190
except that poor bastard.

291
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,234
Not even a kitty cat.

292
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,862
The rest of you have a choice.

293
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,616
Me or...

294
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,457
You want to control the world.

295
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,212
I just want to punish it.

296
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,011
I will remember this.

297
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,222
I think everyone will.

298
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,310
Huh. I need someone to help me
operate this, don't I?

299
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,020
Nerds?

300
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,313
Come with me.

301
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,731
All right, you know what to do

302
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,483
if you want to see
your families again.

303
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,901
Ciao.

304
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,744
Kill her.

305
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,331
Shit.

306
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,211
Did you think I would trust you?

307
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:02,386
It is hard finding good help
these days.

308
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,126
There's a war coming.

309
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,922
The sides are being chosen.

310
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,219
And everyone you love
will be destroyed.

311
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,117
Lost six pints of blood.

312
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,744
Normal person dies at four.

313
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,412
We're shipping her back
to our black site.

314
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,081
-She may not make it.
-But did her story check out?

315
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,666
We confirmed
the shooting downtown,

316
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,251
but her tech wasn't there.

317
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,712
And whoever took it
now has an electronic arsenal.

318
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:44,715
-You've alerted your people?
-Yeah, Mia and Brian are safe.

319
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,843
I tried to get in touch
with Roman, Tej, Ramsey, Han.

320
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:51,096
-No answer.
-Any idea where they might be?

321
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,184
In Rome.

322
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,977
Working for you.

323
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,813
Dom, we don't... we don't have
a mission in Rome.

324
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,691
It's a setup.

325
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,693
Shit.

326
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,987
We're going to Rome.

327
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,739
-Follow me.
-Yes, sir.

328
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:19,583
Son, you and I will finish
that driving lesson.

329
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,711
It's a promise.

330
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,090
No matter what happens.

331
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,384
And I always keep my promises.

332
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,177
Head back up.

333
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,722
" by ANNA,
MadMan and Gemitaiz playing)

339
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:46,235
So can somebody
please help me understand

340
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:48,487
how we're pulling off
a mobile heist

341
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,322
but I don't even get to drive?

342
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,366
Well, the sooner we break into
the truck and steal the chip,

343
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:55,828
the sooner you get to live
la dolce vita, okay?

345
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,331
Roman, the convoy's
almost in position.

346
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,833
Where the hell are you at?

347
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,292
You're supposed to be
running interference.

348
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,712
Romey-Rome's in the building.

349
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:07,256
-You see me shining, baby.

350
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,799
We on my mission now.

351
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,093
Yeah, we all know
that this is your mission.

352
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:14,263
'Cause nobody else on Earth
would put Han in an Alfa.

353
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:17,099
You know, we'd already
be there if Roman wasn't

354
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,475
driving Fort Knox on wheels.

355
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,270
You know
what's under this hood, baby.

356
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,271
This car is sick.

357
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,775
What this old girl lacks
in horsepower,

358
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,110
she makes up for in agility.

359
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,695
Yeah, it's true.

360
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,697
While the Lamborghini has a V-10

361
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,532
with a Stage 3
UGR twin-turbo kit,

362
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,535
the Alfa will definitely have an
advantage in this environment.

363
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:38,537
What?

364
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,373
Oh, that's right.
I know stuff now.

365
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,375
-Will you marry me?

366
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,043
That's all it took?

370
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,133
All those agency toys,

371
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,801
and you still can't reach Roman?

372
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,345
No cell phone,
emails or text messages.

373
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,930
Nothing's going through.

374
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,516
I even tried swiping right
on Han's dating app.

375
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,853
Whoever sent him
on this bogus mission

376
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:05,522
made for damn sure
we couldn't warn them.

377
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:09,359
Keep searching. They're close.

378
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,236
All right, everybody, showtime.

379
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,155
-Here we go!

380
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,914
In position.

381
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,415
Cue Tiny Tej.

382
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,584
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold up. Tiny Tej?

383
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,920
-What are you talking about,
Roman? -

384
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,713
All right, all right,
fire 'em up!

385
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,256
We never agreed on that.

386
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,634
You said you wanted to drive.
Now you driving.

387
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,345
-What are you laughing at?
Don't... -

388
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,430
Where'd you even get that?

389
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,308
Just so you know,
Tiny Tej's brain?

390
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,518
Still bigger than yours.

391
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,909
Back is blind.

392
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,869
Watch out, ladies.
This ain't "nun" ya business!

393
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,830
It's time to shine!

394
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,524
We're in. I have the wheel.

395
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,277
We're locked inside!

396
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,779
The truck's being
steered remotely.

397
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,251
And a one, and a two, and a...

398
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,847
Holy shit! What happened?!

399
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,516
Put a little too much in, huh?
Ready?

400
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,402
That was awesome!

401
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,570
Ooh.

402
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,030
Scusi!

403
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,867
They're stealing our truck.

404
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,869
And with us inside.

405
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,166
Just got reports of
two explosions near the Forum.

406
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,959
That's them.

407
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,133
Ready? And...

408
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,551
-Wait, you hear that?

409
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,970
-What the hell is that?!
-I have no idea!

410
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,224
Oh, shit.

411
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,476
That's a big-ass bomb!

412
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,269
-What?
-Bomb!

413
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,271
Roman, you said
this was carrying chips

414
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,481
for a supercomputer.

415
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,899
That is not a chip.
It's a bomb!

416
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,526
What happens if it goes off?

417
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,862
What do you mean,
"What happens if it goes off?"

418
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,739
The Seven Hills of Rome
will be down to two and a half!

419
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,825
City-wide devastation,
countless lives lost.

420
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,535
You know, the thing bombs do.

421
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,412
We're coming to you.

422
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,169
All right, dorks.
What are we blowing up?

423
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,295
What?

424
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,755
The Vatican?

425
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,382
Wow.

426
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:19,758
Okay. I'll do it.

427
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,760
But you guys are going to hell.

428
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,805
That's their truck.

429
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,476
Oh, thank God. Dom, Letty.

430
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,728
Ooh. Look who's here.

431
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,896
You're right on time, Dominic.

432
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,773
Turn off the encrypted radio.

433
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:37,859
Ramsey?

434
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,612
We're being remote-controlled.
There's a bomb on board.

435
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,323
It's a DM-79 subnautical
high-yield neutron mine.

436
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,994
Ah! Found it.

437
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,287
I can disarm it
with an agency kill switch.

438
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,289
I just need physical hands
on the device.

439
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,291
-We have to stop that truck.
-Sorry, Captain America.

440
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,876
Can't let you do that.

441
00:29:56,503 --> 00:30:00,007
We got to hurry!
The truck is speeding up.

442
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,760
-We got to block its path.
-I'm gonna get ahead of it.

443
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,179
Ramsey, Tej, strap in.

444
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,559
Whoop.

445
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,695
Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

446
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,492
Dom, go ahead! I'm pinched!

447
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,203
Dominic.

448
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,457
Come on!

449
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,585
Damn it, he's fast.

450
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,510
Really? The clothesline?

451
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,970
Well, we can't drive it,

452
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,722
guess we're just
gonna have to roll it.

453
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:10,911
Holy shit! The truck's
about to go over the hill!

454
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,580
-We have to crash into it.
-We have to what?!

455
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,263
I'm so sorry, my gold baby!

456
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,350
It's not stopping!

457
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,104
Dom, the bomb is out.

458
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,317
Everybody, stay clear.
I got this.

459
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,194
No. We got this.

460
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,126
Letty!

461
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,389
Have we made them all
terrorists?

462
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:13,849
Their images have been
fed to the authorities.

463
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,393
All right, Bob!
I got to go kill that jerk

464
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,019
that's trying to disarm my bomb.

465
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,729
It's always something, you know?
Oh.

466
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,774
Remember, I still have your
families, so don't go anywhere.

467
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,393
Buongiorno, Roma!

468
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,936
All right.

469
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,947
Man, who the hell is that?

470
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,490
Hey! There he is!

471
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,826
Man of the hour.
Roman Pearce, team leader.

472
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,412
Can't wait to see you
get out of this one.

473
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,837
Oh, Letty!

474
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,173
I think I found our guy.

475
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,091
Hey, Letty. Vaffanculo!

476
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,719
I'm on him.

477
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,693
That pump's gonna blow.

478
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,914
Little Nobody, you're up.

479
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,756
-Moving to dis...
-Peekaboo!

480
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,934
-Get out of there!
It's gonna blow! -Oh, shit.

481
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,731
-Boom.

482
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,502
We need to jam
the detonator now.

483
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,754
I got it, I got it.
Letty, don't lose him.

484
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,758
I can lock on to your location
and transmit

485
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,426
cellular interference
through your phone.

486
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:21,096
That should jam his detonator
and buy us some time.

487
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,184
Letty.

488
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,019
Bravo!

489
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,479
It's getting tricky, guys.

490
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,273
I can't stay on him
for much longer.

491
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,233
Ramsey, how deep is that river?

492
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,360
The Tiber? Uh...

493
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,862
Uh, 60 feet.

494
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,405
I mean, the water could
smother the explosion,

495
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:22,740
reduce its power
by ten times, maybe.

496
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,675
Damn it!

497
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,679
You missed me
by that much, baby!

498
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,643
I lost him. He's gone.

499
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,061
-Damn!

500
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,188
He's out of our reach.

501
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,772
We can't jam the signal anymore.

502
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,609
Bad news, Dom.
I'm back in business.

503
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,913
You got 30 seconds to save Rome.

504
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:15,835
Dom, he armed the bomb,
and you're almost at the river.

505
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,371
15 seconds, Dom.

506
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:53,581
Dom, listen to me.

507
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,041
The Vatican's within
the blast radius.

508
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,459
Get out of there.

509
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,169
You've done
everything you could.

510
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,879
Not everything.

511
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,596
Five.

512
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,100
Four.

513
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,812
Three.

514
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,983
Two.

515
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,110
One.

516
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,611
What have we done?

517
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:12,076
Through your suffering,
I'll fulfill my destiny.

518
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,997
Come find me.

519
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,916
Your pain has just begun.

520
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,460
I'll see you soon, Dom.

521
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,128
Breaking news from Italy.

522
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:25,256
The capital Rome has been hit
by a massive explosion.

523
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,013
...to be
a large military weapon.

524
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:34,849
The Vatican has sustained

525
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,933
some structural damage.

526
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,685
...but no lives were claimed.

527
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,605
Authorities have identified
the terrorists as

528
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,690
-these five individuals.

529
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,276
...as these five individuals,
led by this man.

530
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,278
-Dominic Toretto.
-Toretto. -Toretto.

531
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,114
-Dominic Toretto.
-Dominic Toretto.

532
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,617
Law enforcement is
working across borders,

533
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,827
mobilizing
an international fugitive hunt

534
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,329
-of unprecedented scale.
-I'm sorry, sir.

535
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:58,289
-I don't know how she got in.
-I do.

536
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,749
I stole your badge.

537
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,460
I'm done with it now, though.
Thanks.

538
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,170
Well, if it isn't, um--

539
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,797
Honestly, I-I don't know
what to call you.

540
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,382
Little Miss Nobody?

541
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,050
How about you call me
by my actual name?

542
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,220
Last I heard, Tess, you were
running ops in Damascus.

543
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,638
You think you can
walk in this room

544
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,223
just 'cause your daddy's
an agency legend?

545
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,891
I'm here because
someone needs to speak

546
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,559
on behalf of the defense.

547
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,895
What just happened in Rome
was an unmitigated disaster.

548
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,563
Casualties were kept
to a minimum,

549
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,940
but the impact was global.

550
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,442
And what do you think
happened in Italy?

551
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,904
Oh, sightseeing,
eating bucatini,

552
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,948
-stealing a 20-kiloton bomb.
-Oh, come on, Aimes.

553
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,492
-That's bullshit
and you know it. -Careful, now.

554
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,202
With Little Nobody
out of commission

555
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:39,831
and your daddy in the wind,
you're talking to the new boss.

556
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,833
Showtime.

557
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,835
Los Angeles, 2001.

558
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,379
Humble roots, local kids,

559
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:49,006
street racers
who became hijackers.

560
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,426
Graduated to
high-speed smuggling,

561
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,094
mobile jailbreaks,
train robberies.

562
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,930
If it could be done in a car,
they did it.

563
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,767
If it violates the laws of God
and gravity, they did it twice.

564
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:02,186
You write that yourself?

565
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,272
We first took notice in 2011,

566
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:07,775
Rio, when they robbed
a drug kingpin, Hernan Reyes,

567
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,610
left his body on a bridge.

568
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,406
My predecessor, Mr. Nobody,
saw potential,

569
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:15,658
so he recruited them--
freelance, of course.

570
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,869
They ran missions for us
in Abu Dhabi,

571
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,538
Tokyo, London,
New York, Tbilisi.

572
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,540
You ask me, we should've
cut ties years back,

573
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,209
but they had their champions.

574
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,711
That's their M.O.

575
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,629
To corrupt law enforcement.

576
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,006
Brian O'Conner.

577
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,799
Elena Neves. Luke Hobbs.

578
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,634
Everyone becomes family.

579
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,553
It's like a cult with cars.

580
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:39,056
Even Tess's dear old dad.

581
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,225
So we're all just

582
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,811
a barbecue and a beer away
from corruption?

583
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,146
What's your point?

584
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,564
Point is they're criminals.

585
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,399
Rome was a matter of time.

586
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,109
They've stolen
hundreds of millions of dollars

587
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,446
and at least one nuclear sub.

588
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:57,074
The real question is: How did
we let this go on so long?

589
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,744
This family has gotten their
hands dirty to keep ours clean.

590
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:03,414
They've driven to the gates of
hell and back for this agency.

591
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,416
Something is not right
with Rome.

592
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,584
It can't be.

593
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,961
It can and it is.

594
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,755
The agency is better than this.

595
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,256
We are smarter than this.

596
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,800
We should be standing with Dom
and his family.

597
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,384
That is the very least
that we can do.

598
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,220
If we don't act,
this blows back on all of us.

599
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,972
The fallout will be existential.

600
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,101
I'm asking for
full green-light authority.

601
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,687
Kill or capture
the Toretto clan by any means.

602
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,731
Aimes, what are you doing?

603
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,490
Looks like the ayes have it.

604
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,367
As your direct superior,

605
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,036
I don't give a shit about
anybody's heart of gold,

606
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,789
and I hate barbecues.

607
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,375
You know I'd make a
freight train take a dirt road,

608
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:50,628
so do not get in my way.

609
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,966
Okay.

610
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,720
I'll go my own way.

617
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,502
When Rome falls,
so does the world.

618
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,672
Well, it ain't no Roman holiday.

619
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,466
And you're no Gregory Peck.

620
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:39,343
Mm.

621
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,845
My family?

622
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:44,599
Your team's gone to ground.
They're safe for now.

623
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,143
They've taken Letty.

624
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,646
-Who's they?
-The agency.

625
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,440
And you've just shot
to number one

626
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,150
on the world's most wanted list.

627
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,695
Whoever did this wanted
to sever your ties to the agency

628
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,739
and isolate you
from your family.

629
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:02,909
Any attempt to contact your team
will be traced.

630
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,536
I need you to get a message
to Mr. Nobody.

631
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,205
You'll need a medium for that
or a magician.

632
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,291
He's done his disappearing act.

633
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,710
Just get the message out.

634
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,046
Tell him I'm ready
to have that Belgian,

635
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,380
and he'll know where to go.

636
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,840
I've got a message for you,
ducky.

637
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,260
The world is on fire,
and you want to keep running

638
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,638
into the burning building
to save lives,

639
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:26,891
but eventually the building's
gonna collapse on you.

640
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,601
I don't care about dying.

641
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,773
I only care about protecting
the people that I love.

642
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,652
You know why gladiators
never had families?

643
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,779
-Why?
-Because they knew

644
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:42,573
that every day
might be their last.

645
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,619
You're choosing a lonely way,
my darling.

646
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,372
Can't take anyone with you.

647
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,811
Bring God's Eye online.

648
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,938
-Yes, sir.
-Initiating.

649
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,856
Get me Toretto
and the others' locations

650
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,358
to the millimeter.

651
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:18,901
Sir, we have a problem.

652
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,945
The God's Eye tracking hardware
has been removed.

653
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,655
Tess.

654
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,116
I guess her visit
wasn't purely a social call.

655
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,450
Do me a favor.

656
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,953
She pops up on any grid,
let's see where she goes.

657
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:32,790
As for the rest, our fugitives
aren't unknown quantities.

658
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,460
Toretto has a sister, a son.

659
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,838
Until we find him,

660
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,506
find his family.

661
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,737
Oh!

662
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,405
-Again.

663
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,657
Wow.

664
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,200
Are you cheating
on-on your favorite auntie?

665
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,037
It doesn't matter if you win
by an inch or a mile.

666
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:12,163
Winning's winning.

667
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,165
Where have I heard
that one before?

668
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,836
Go! Go!

669
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,506
Search everywhere!
We need them alive!

670
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:30,347
Get on the ground!

671
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,518
No! Mia! Let her go!

672
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,317
Run!

673
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,887
-What's up?
-Uncle Jakob?

674
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:10,930
Your dad sent me.

675
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,808
Change of plans.

676
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:34,036
Don't move!

677
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,122
-I said don't move!

678
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,164
Do you have Little B?

679
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,457
B!

680
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,336
-Freeze!

681
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,719
-You okay?
-Yeah.

682
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:39,852
Are you okay?

683
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,649
B!

684
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,276
Come, come.

685
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,323
Who the hell were those guys?

686
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:55,492
Agency. Rome was a trap.
Whole family's being targeted.

687
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,077
Okay, I got to get to Brian
and the kids...

688
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,370
Dom sent me to take him.

689
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,372
Remember that place
we said we'd go

690
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,665
if the world went to hell?

691
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,500
Dom wants the team
to meet there.

692
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,919
Yeah.

693
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:06,170
Okay, look.

694
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,713
Little B, you're gonna go
with Uncle Jakob.

695
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,924
Okay? You do whatever he says.
Yeah?

696
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:12,760
I'm gonna get you to your dad.
If that's okay with you.

697
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:15,888
Protect him with your life.

698
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,099
I love you, Jakey.

699
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,393
I love you, too, sis.

700
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,145
Let's do it.

701
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,990
Oh, my God.

702
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,203
Yo!

703
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,038
It's not that one.

704
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,957
It's this one.

705
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,709
Yep.

706
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:48,963
Wait, but...

707
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,714
Hmm?

716
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,664
I'm looking for someone.

717
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,958
You boys look like
you could use a drink.

718
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:29,253
How about a round on me? Huh?

719
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:30,754
As a matter of fact,

720
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,008
I will buy as many rounds
as they can handle.

721
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,926
You come in here
looking for people

722
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:36,927
you ain't walking out.

726
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:49,023
Shots? No?

727
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,858
Shots?

728
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,868
Beers. Two of 'em.

729
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,579
Thanks.

730
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,081
Cheers.

731
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,795
Queenie told me
I could find you here.

732
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,130
Belgian?

733
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,382
Mr. Nobody said
he had a daughter.

734
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,384
He did?

735
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:21,305
Well, now that
he's gone missing,

736
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:23,015
I came in from the cold.

737
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:25,017
Your dad kept the agency
in line.

738
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:28,354
Now it feels like
all the anchors have been cut.

739
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:32,733
In a world where there is
no code, no one's safe.

740
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,693
You're right.

741
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:38,155
The agency has turned its back
on everything it stood for.

742
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:41,450
The new boss, Aimes, he's coming
for you with everything.

743
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,495
I'm buying you some time.

744
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:49,666
And borrowed their, uh,
little tracking device thingy.

745
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,252
Look familiar?

746
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,670
-God's Eye.
-Mm-hmm.

747
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,422
I'd put that
in a vault somewhere.

748
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:58,717
People pull vaults out of walls,
so I think it's safer with me.

749
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,386
I pulled a screen grab

750
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:02,221
off of a traffic cam
that they missed,

751
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:03,847
put it in God's Eye.

752
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,516
There was a hit in Rio.

753
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:08,435
You wouldn't happen to have
any enemies in Rio, would you?

754
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,771
-Reyes.
-Hernan Reyes?

755
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:15,567
Still pretty dead,
but he has a son, Dante.

756
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,530
So you're gonna
have to get me to Rio.

757
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,866
That's your second wish.
You have one more.

758
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,202
Letty.

759
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,250
Letty's in a black site prison
off of every map.

760
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,584
Then get her out.

761
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,128
Nobody can.

762
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,921
Nobody would.

763
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,381
Dom, I'm so sorry,

764
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:40,759
but what you're asking me to do
is impossible.

765
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,644
Nothing's impossible.

766
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,066
You just have to have faith.

767
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:10,414
Sneaking us out of Rome
in a shipping container

768
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:12,833
full of aftershave,
that was a terrible idea, Roman.

769
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:15,836
Wait, I think
I lost my sense of smell.

770
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,754
That is not aftershave.
That is tear gas.

771
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,507
Hey, man, I don't know
what y'all are talking about.

772
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,509
You know what I mean?

773
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:23,886
I smell magic.

774
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:25,345
I took a bottle for myself.

775
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,014
This is all thanks to you.

776
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,557
You know that, right?

777
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:31,185
No, see, you just got to follow
my "leat" as a "leater."

778
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:34,897
You see what I'm saying?
I'm a natural-born "leater."

779
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:36,732
Where are we?

780
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:38,567
I brought you back home, Ramsey.

781
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:41,487
The city with the most
amount of surveillance cameras.

782
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:42,779
Perfect.

783
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:55,792
-Dad know you drive this thing?
-He should.

784
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,002
I raced him in it.

785
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,671
And just so you know,
in the '90s,

786
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,466
if you were rolling in a 5.0,
it meant you were the man.

787
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:05,135
Like it or not,
it's still a 'Stang.

788
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,888
So, you know, respect.

789
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,182
You know what?

790
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,185
Traveling music.

793
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,193
I got this car when I was 13.

794
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:24,696
Did the repaint myself.
Rebuilt the motor, too.

795
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:28,408
Ah. Sometimes you just
can't help what you love, kid.

796
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,827
Are you gonna tell me
where we're going?

797
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:34,831
A place of mine your dad knows.

798
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,166
We're gonna meet him there.

799
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,543
So he's okay?

800
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,212
We'll meet him there.

806
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,139
This guy was an underwear model.

807
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,600
-What?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

808
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,143
Here we go and...

809
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,687
Little B, bring it back.
It's a boomerang.

810
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:58,272
It's a boomerang, maybe.

811
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,606
Ah...

812
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,109
Oh! Look at you!

813
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:03,360
That's feeling it.

814
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,195
That's called
feeling the vibrations.

815
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,489
It's just energy, man.
It's energy. It's vibrations.

816
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,991
Feel it! Feel it!

818
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,711
-You're clear, Director.

819
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,511
Fancy coat.

820
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,680
Expensive earrings.

821
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,682
Those got to hurt.

822
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,144
You really brought out
the big guns, huh?

823
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:38,854
I'm not here for the agency.

824
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,399
You could've confiscated that.

825
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,484
That scar on your left wrist,

826
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,737
you got it
the night you met Dom.

827
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,405
He said he was showing off.

828
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,574
I put an ultrasonic jammer
on the audio,

829
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,659
but the cameras
can still see us.

830
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,371
Look, I'm gonna
get you out of here,

831
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,581
but it's gonna take some time.

832
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,249
Time is what I don't have.

833
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,626
I need to get back to Dom.

834
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:02,711
I'm no good to anyone
in this cage.

835
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:06,423
I have a feeling you didn't come
all this way without a plan.

836
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,217
Game recognizes game.

837
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:12,846
If I make this move,
there's no coming back.

838
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,182
I like it already.

839
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:18,185
Okay. First, let's get you
out of this cell.

840
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:20,562
-It's gonna hurt.
-Hmm?

841
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,523
-Work with me.

842
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:24,775
Open the door!

843
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:25,859
-Knock it down!

844
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,944
Guards! Guards!

845
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,237
- Help!
-Let her go!

846
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,782
-Let her go!

847
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,455
Really?

861
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,598
Que surpresa!

862
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,851
Look at this.

863
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,602
None of this happens
without you.

864
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,604
Welcome home.
Good to see you, bro.

865
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:45,772
Diogo, good to see you.

866
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,482
Ah. Look at you.

867
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,985
So, uh, I hear you got
a little heat on you.

868
00:58:49,985 --> 00:58:52,195
Nah, I'm just looking
for someone.

869
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,739
How can we help?

870
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,032
Boss, he's here

871
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,869
You already did.

872
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:12,674
What's up?

873
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:14,468
Who's next?

874
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:16,720
Who's
next?

875
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:19,139
I need you to meet somebody.
A GOAT.

876
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:20,056
A living legend, literally.

877
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,808
Yeah, I know
who he is.

878
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:23,518
hard not to.

879
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,645
You must be in
the winner's circle tonight.

880
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,898
I see you put in a RB26
in that, right?

881
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:30,734
L24 would never handle
this much boost.

882
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:32,277
My boy back home would approve.

883
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,321
I'm not looking for
anyone's approval.

884
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,575
Before you get ahead
of yourself, look around you.

885
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:41,495
We're all looking for
a little validation.

886
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:43,079
-You racing or what?

887
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,456
Trust me,
you don't want that smoke.

888
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:45,624
I'm not here
for pink slips tonight.

889
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:47,083
Shame

890
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,462
It would have
felt good to beat him

891
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:52,130
-You and everyone here.

892
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,642
Yeah!

893
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:12,692
A million dollars
for whoever can beat me.

894
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,277
Diogo, here.

895
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,487
Yes.

896
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,113
Isabel.

897
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,281
Congratulations.

898
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:19,616
Thanks.

899
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,493
There will be
a race tonight, yes?

900
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:22,828
Yeah, maybe.

901
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:24,120
-Pretty please, with me on top.

902
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,792
Dominic Toretto.

903
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,127
I knew you would come for me.

904
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:34,256
I'm sorry we didn't
get to meet in Roma.

905
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:36,424
We were both so busy.

906
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,593
I'm Dante. Enchanté.

907
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:44,641
And you were
fantástico, fabuloso, o cara.

908
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,560
He saved the Vatican.

909
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,811
Who does that?

910
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:51,064
Seriously. The Pope? God?

911
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,983
By the way,
did you see what I did there?

912
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:54,776
The ball through the city was

913
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,487
a bit of an homage
to my family's safe.

914
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,656
Except it was on fire.

915
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,828
You remember my father?

916
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:07,414
-Hernan Reyes.
-Yes.

917
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:10,709
I remember he thought he had
his foot on this city's neck.

918
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:12,252
But you know what happened?

919
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:14,504
I took him down.

920
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,924
Let's not argue
in front of the children.

921
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,509
You are absolutely right.

922
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,137
My father was a horrible man,

923
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,723
very bad daddy,

924
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,600
but I kind of liked him.

925
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,269
And you took him from me
when you stole our money

926
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:31,771
and left us
with nothing but suffering.

927
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:34,816
Well, that's what
I came here for.

928
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:37,527
To end that suffering.

929
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,739
Oh, and I didn't take
that money.

930
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,243
I burned it.

931
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,787
Uh-oh.

932
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,832
Well, Brazil is mine,

933
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,375
and I own this city.

934
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:55,587
Ooh.

935
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:01,968
You people think
you can buy everything.

936
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,014
But you can't buy the streets.

937
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,812
We stand with Dom.

938
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:18,526
Well, this is awkward.

939
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:21,821
So, how about we all just
start shooting each other

940
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:22,864
and see what happens?

941
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,742
Or we race.

942
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,744
If you win, you take me in.

943
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,120
If you lose...

944
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,958
Don't lose.

945
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:36,461
You all came 'cause
you wanted to see a race.

946
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,424
Let's race!

956
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,869
Ouch.

957
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:18,670
Ooh.

958
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:21,131
Black on black look good.

959
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:22,549
I know what you're thinking,

960
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:24,592
and, yes, the carpet
matches the drapes.

961
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:25,802
Thank you.

962
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:33,351
I can't believe I'm gonna race
the great Dominic Toretto.

963
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,395
I have butterflies.

964
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:37,063
You're just so impressive.

965
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,940
You've won so many races.

966
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,358
Everyone loves you.

967
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:44,154
You've saved so many lives.

968
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:45,905
I know.

969
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,199
It's like you're a...

970
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:50,326
a saint.

971
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:52,662
Saint Dominic.

972
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:56,166
And I've been studying you.

973
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,668
And watching you.

974
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,213
I can't figure it out.

975
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,381
How...

976
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,177
How do you choose?

977
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,431
How do you choose
the ones you save?

978
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:22,609
" by Daddy
Yankee & Myke Towers playing)

981
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,377
Cheguei.

982
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,338
This is Rio de
Janeiro, baby!

983
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:44,881
Set?

984
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:54,849
Let's go!

990
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,116
Yahoo!

994
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,750
Yeah!

998
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:29,759
I'm beating you, baby!

999
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:39,018
Oh.

1000
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,520
You're too eager.

1001
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,063
That's what I'm talking about!

1002
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,661
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You shouldn't do that.

1003
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,294
Now it's my turn.

1004
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:05,795
Dominic, who will you choose?

1005
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:10,592
Who you gonna choose, Dom?

1006
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:13,928
Are you gonna save her?

1007
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,391
-Or are you gonna save him?
-Let's go, baby!

1008
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,852
This race is mine!

1009
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,938
Eeny, meeny, miny...

1010
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:27,442
What are you doing?

1011
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:29,819
Looks like you made your choice.

1012
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,029
Finally! Whoo!

1013
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:37,619
Oh, no, Diogo!

1014
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,207
Trick question. Everyone dies.

1015
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:44,167
And one, two, three.

1016
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:53,635
-Boom!

1017
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,513
Yeah!

1018
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,354
Yeah!

1019
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:07,440
I win, baby!

1020
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,775
Keep coming, Dom!

1021
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:12,153
There's so much more fun
to be had!

1022
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:16,324
Come on.

1023
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,336
Good morning, sunshine.

1024
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,963
Goddamn it.

1025
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,508
And then he was like, "Boom!"

1026
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,593
And I was like, "Blam!"
And she was like, "What?"

1027
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,262
I was like, "Shut up."

1028
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:21,514
And now I'm the best racer
in the world, so...

1029
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:25,685
Do not touch that. Let it dry.

1030
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,273
You guys look fantastic.

1031
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:33,901
I know the black is
very slimming and very scary,

1032
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:35,778
but the pastels, you know,
they're in season,

1033
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,781
and I feel like it tones down
the masculinity a little bit,

1034
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,825
which we all need these days.

1035
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:43,369
Did you know...

1036
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,954
Listen to me.

1037
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,457
Did you know that I was
legally dead for two minutes?

1038
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:48,791
Two minutes.

1039
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,960
-Bob, pay attention.

1040
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,129
And you know what I saw?

1041
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,339
Nothing.

1042
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,591
Not a goddamn thing.

1043
01:08:56,591 --> 01:09:00,845
But I do feel like
once he, uh...

1044
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:03,598
cracked my skull open,
it just opened my mind.

1045
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,601
Yeah, that's deep, right?

1046
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:08,895
-You're absolutely right, Bob.

1047
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,063
We should get back to work.

1048
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,399
Such a stickler.

1049
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:16,903
All right. (sighs) Let's see.

1050
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:18,321
Should we take all their money?

1051
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:22,658
You. You are evil.

1052
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,577
-Thank you for listening.

1053
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,204
So, mi casa, su casa.

1054
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:28,373
Let these dry,
finish those mojitos,

1055
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:30,833
and, um, someone's gonna come
and bury you guys soon.

1056
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,877
I'm gonna go wash my hair.

1061
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:01,864
No.

1062
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,032
-What?

1063
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:07,912
All right.

1064
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,124
Whoa.

1065
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:13,376
Cool. What is that?

1066
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:14,710
That's a technical tool kit.

1067
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,546
Don't worry, it's just
a bunch of awesome stuff

1068
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,423
that you're never
gonna get to use.

1069
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:20,800
-Okay.

1070
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,010
Eyes open. Hold still.

1071
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,470
Don't smile like that.

1072
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,180
-It's unsettling.

1073
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,516
Sweet.
Your new name is Chester...

1074
01:10:28,516 --> 01:10:31,227
-Chester? -...and you're
on a kayaking trip with

1075
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:32,311
-your handsome,

1076
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,272
ripped Uncle Roger.

1077
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:36,065
All right.

1078
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,359
Now, time to get you
some new clothes.

1079
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,111
You know, something
a little more chic than

1080
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:42,405
pj pants, all right?

1081
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:45,283
-From a gas station?
-From a gas station.

1082
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,581
See, I just don't understand.

1083
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:54,459
Why would the agency
turn they backs on us,

1084
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:56,419
after all we've done for them?

1085
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:57,962
That madman pinned it all on us,

1086
01:10:57,962 --> 01:10:59,547
and now we're
public enemy number one.

1087
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:03,176
Well, Dom is gonna meet us
at the rendezvous point.

1088
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:05,011
But in the meantime,
we have to stay under the radar.

1089
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,471
And we got to get ready
to fight.

1090
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:09,682
Wait, so we need guns,
artillery, tanks?

1091
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:12,518
Yeah, but how are we gonna
get that with no money?

1092
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:14,020
What?

1093
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:15,271
-We've been hacked.

1094
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,856
Look. Every account.

1095
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:21,235
Every dollar we made
over the last 20 years is gone.

1096
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:22,570
He took everything.

1097
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,155
We got heisted
during our own heist.

1098
01:11:24,155 --> 01:11:25,781
-Just decrypt the... Yeah.
-Decrypt the blockchain.

1099
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,783
I'm on it. Then we can find
the transaction hash.

1100
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,118
-The transaction hash.

1101
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:29,952
Gets us the receiving IPs.
Exactly.

1102
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:30,995
English.

1103
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,288
Following our money, genius.

1104
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,623
We're trying to see
where he sent it.

1105
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:34,957
The coding is next-level.

1106
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,043
I've never seen
anything like this.

1107
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,462
We need more computing power.

1108
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,172
How are we gonna do that
if we broke?

1109
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:43,674
What do you mean, "we" broke?

1110
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:48,513
Wait, you holding out on us?

1111
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:50,056
No wonder you've been so calm.

1112
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:53,059
Bro, what-what d--
what do you think this is, bro?

1113
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:55,144
You know what? Turn around.

1114
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,270
"Turn around"? What do you...

1115
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,730
What you mean, "turn around"?

1116
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,690
Man, I'm a grown-ass...

1117
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,736
-What-- N-- What are you doing?
-Hey, Roman, do not.

1118
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:08,324
Please tell me
you're not wearing Spanx.

1119
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,576
Oh, this ain't Spanx.
These banks.

1120
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,662
But it's okay, bro. I got you.

1121
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:13,996
All right?

1122
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,457
You know what I mean?

1123
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:21,170
Yeah. That's for you.

1124
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,172
That's for you.

1125
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:24,340
Let me see.

1126
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,759
Han, you always good
for the bag,

1127
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:29,929
'cause the bag
always come back, you know.

1128
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:33,891
So what I need from
all of y'all, I need receipts.

1129
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:36,644
Who is you talking to?
Got your receipt.

1130
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:40,898
So where do we go
to shop off the grid?

1131
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:43,442
I know a place.

1132
01:12:59,584 --> 01:13:02,878
Wait. The agency's after us.
Aren't they gonna see our faces?

1133
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:04,380
Yeah, I'm counting on it.

1134
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,840
The first rule of tradecraft:

1135
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,800
you can't lose a tail
if they don't find you.

1136
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,135
-Oh, sorry.
-Sorry.

1137
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:10,553
I'll just-- Wait.
You know what, I'm just...

1138
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:11,762
We'll just--
If you want to, uh, go.

1139
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,222
Uh, we'll stay here.

1140
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,599
-You guys, you guys go around.
-Go around? Great.

1141
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:16,350
Go around.

1142
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,149
Sir, we just got a hit
on the boy and his uncle.

1143
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:24,734
The rest of the team
is still in Europe.

1144
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:25,985
We're interfacing
with local authorities.

1145
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,445
Forget authorities.

1146
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:28,904
These people have been
outrunning the cops

1147
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:30,239
since they could
reach the gas pedal.

1148
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,074
Get word to
every snitch, smuggler,

1149
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,284
hitter and hacker
we've ever used.

1150
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:35,995
Money talks and so will they.

1151
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:37,580
-We're getting an alert

1152
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:38,539
on Black Site A.

1153
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:40,958
Tess just visited Ortiz.

1154
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:42,501
They have a nice chat?

1155
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,129
Guess not.

1156
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,757
Run it back for me.

1157
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:51,886
Stop. Zoom in.

1158
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,389
Back-trace her flight path.

1159
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:57,058
Find out where she was
before this.

1160
01:13:57,058 --> 01:13:58,893
That's where Dom is.

1161
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,786
You knew who I was
all along, didn't you?

1162
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:18,621
From the moment I saw you.

1163
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:23,334
Your sister smiled with her eyes
and led with her heart.

1164
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,296
Just like you do.

1165
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,132
We were nothing alike.

1166
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,760
She was the good sister.

1167
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,762
Always putting others first.

1168
01:14:34,762 --> 01:14:37,098
Always doing what was right.

1169
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:43,062
Sometimes I would think
that the wrong sister died.

1170
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,482
Why the good one and not me?

1171
01:14:56,784 --> 01:15:00,454
You're wrong about
not being anything like her.

1172
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:03,457
You think
that's what she wants to hear?

1173
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:08,254
A cop and a street racer.

1174
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:10,214
I'll tell you something.

1175
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:13,259
They travel down the same road
long enough...

1176
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:18,597
...and they realize
how much alike they really are.

1177
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,643
Trust me...

1178
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:26,355
...I know.

1179
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:37,450
She's still doing it, isn't she?

1180
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,497
She's still helping people.

1181
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:49,503
She's helping us.

1182
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:52,965
You know, Elena,

1183
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:55,342
she knew everything
about the Reyes family.

1184
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:57,094
After they killed her husband,

1185
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:59,930
she dedicated her life
trying to take them down.

1186
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:03,309
I think I still have her files.

1187
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:07,146
Wait, so we gonna find
military-grade gear

1188
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:08,647
in the middle of London?

1189
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:10,483
You said you wanted
to shop off the grid.

1190
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:17,406
Wait a second.
Did we just time-travel?

1191
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,700
Would you look for
a black-market operation

1192
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,327
in a place like this?

1193
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,455
You've got mail.

1194
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:26,499
-Ooh, snacks.
-Get me a receipt, homey.

1195
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:30,753
How am I gonna get a receipt
from a vending machine?

1196
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,171
How about you figure it out?

1197
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:34,715
Paper trail, bruh.
For tax write-off.

1198
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:36,091
I swear to God...

1199
01:16:37,718 --> 01:16:39,178
What's up, Bowie420?

1200
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:41,722
Oh, shit. FreddieMerc?

1201
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:45,684
What? I had a life
before you knew me.

1202
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:48,479
Bowie here runs
one of the most notorious

1203
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:50,231
online black markets.

1204
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:52,149
If you want it, he'll sell it.

1205
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,692
I thought you didn't like that
about me, though.

1206
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:55,236
Well, desperate times.

1207
01:16:55,236 --> 01:16:56,779
What kind of muffins are these?

1208
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:57,947
Oh, those are fun muffins.

1209
01:16:57,947 --> 01:16:59,490
You have like four of them,

1210
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:01,116
you'll be in your underwear
watching Fantasia.

1211
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:02,451
Is that what you guys came for?
My muffins?

1212
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,078
Oh, it's gonna be
a muffin party?

1213
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:07,456
We, uh, we need transport.

1214
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,708
Weapons, cars, the works.

1215
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,126
And quietly.

1216
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:12,795
Cool, then I'm just
gonna need cash. Okay?

1217
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,171
None of that crypto stuff.

1218
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:16,298
Oh, the Black Jeff Bezos here
got you covered.

1219
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,843
-Black Bezos? -Yeah, he's even
been into outer space.

1220
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:21,053
-Wow. -If y'all was gonna be
giving out my money,

1221
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:23,138
I'd appreciate
some type of a heads-up,

1222
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:24,390
you know what I'm saying?

1223
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,433
How much we talking about, bruh?

1224
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:28,018
Just like a reasonable amount.

1225
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:30,604
How about that?

1226
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:33,566
That won't even cover
the muffins.

1227
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:34,817
Is this guy serious?

1228
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:36,777
Shit's crazy. Mm-kay.

1229
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:39,029
Come on, man,
you're an astronaut.

1230
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,491
-Well, how about that?

1231
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,159
What, did you leave
all your money in space?

1232
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,870
Man, give me this.

1233
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,663
-Thank you.
-Are you serious right now?

1234
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,999
You know I pay for everything
around here, right?

1235
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,834
You should pay for everything.

1236
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:55,004
It's your mission in Rome that
got us here in the first place.

1237
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,464
No, it was your intel
that led us to Rome.

1238
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:59,508
To be fair, that setup would
have confused the best of us.

1239
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:00,843
No, I'm tired of this.

1240
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,261
'Cause all he do is talk.

1241
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:04,597
And then everyone
has to do their job and yours.

1242
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:05,931
What are you saying, Tej?

1243
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,600
-Mean, what I'm saying?
-Hey, guys.

1244
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,643
-This is a family environment.
-What? Really?

1245
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:11,604
-Really?
-Take it outside, fellas.

1246
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:14,273
So, what we doing, bruh?

1247
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:15,649
Uh-oh.

1248
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,235
-Gentlemen, please! Guys!

1249
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:21,697
-Oh, not the vending machine.
No. -WOMAN: Unbelievable.

1250
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:24,700
Guys, you're causing like
dozens of dollars in damage!

1251
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,535
Let's go. Come on.

1252
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,662
Should we stop this?

1253
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:32,958
-Hold on!
-Nah, let 'em bond.

1254
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,253
Hey!
That computer's from, like, '98!

1255
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:39,048
Huh?

1256
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:42,885
What the hell, man?

1257
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,564
Okay. All right.

1258
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:56,857
We doing stomachs now.

1259
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:58,484
All right, all right,
that's enough.

1260
01:18:58,484 --> 01:19:00,110
-You've been wanting that
for years! -BOWIE: Uh, I think

1261
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:02,363
he hit the copy machine so hard
it works now.

1262
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,243
What the hell was that?

1263
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:09,411
He's like a ghetto magician.

1264
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,372
You know what it is, bruh.

1265
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:13,457
-I beat your ass.
-You just beat my ass?

1266
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:14,750
-Beat my ass, huh?
-My God,

1267
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,126
will you two just quit it?
Please.

1268
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:18,128
We don't have time for this.
You.

1269
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:19,755
-Get to work.
-Oh, I just need

1270
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,674
to hack into the marketplace.
It'll just take a second.

1271
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,717
Oops.

1272
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:25,552
What the hell, Bowie?
What did you just do?

1273
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:27,012
I'm sorry.
Your guys's faces are,

1274
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:28,681
like, all over the dark web.

1275
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,516
I mean, that reward is dope.

1276
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,184
- Ow. Hey.
-We have to move.

1277
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:34,687
-The agency's minutes away.
-Look, it's nothing personal.

1278
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:37,147
-Hey, fun muffins on me, okay?
-What? Huh?

1279
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:38,190
-Oh!
-Oh!

1280
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,359
I deserved that.

1281
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:43,112
-Are you okay, bro?
-Yeah, thank you, man.

1282
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:49,994
All right, so where to now, huh?

1283
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:51,370
-Jail?

1284
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:54,707
I know somewhere.
Last place I want to go.

1285
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,818
How does it feel to be
on my side of the law?

1286
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,821
They like to fix things
before they break 'em.

1287
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,574
It's a sick place, Letty.

1288
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,328
You're welcome.

1289
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:34,830
What did you do?

1290
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,916
I rerouted anesthetic gas
into their air conditioning.

1291
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:41,336
And I bought us a few minutes
before these cameras reset

1292
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:44,214
and they find out this place
turned into a sleep study.

1293
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:51,597
You gonna stay grumpy or
do you want to get out of here?

1294
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:55,059
They're not gonna sleep forever.

1295
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:57,895
Don't you want to get back
to your precious family?

1296
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:01,065
Shit.

1297
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:05,861
Seems like you got this covered.

1298
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,696
-What do you need me for?
-I have a plan,

1299
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,282
but it's a two-person job.

1300
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:20,876
Now, was that so hard?

1301
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,754
How much time do we have?

1302
01:21:23,754 --> 01:21:25,923
I'd say about four minutes.

1303
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,007
It'll have to do.

1308
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,563
I'd stay down if I was you.

1309
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,233
You got to hit me harder
for that.

1310
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:46,026
You're gonna regret this.

1328
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:17,159
Dante Reyes.

1329
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:20,329
Born in Portugal.

1330
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:23,165
Mother from the Pacific Islands.

1331
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:26,168
Sociopathic tendencies
from an early age.

1332
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:29,338
He bounced from juvie to prison
to mental wards.

1333
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:31,757
And each time, Daddy was there
to spring him out.

1334
01:23:31,757 --> 01:23:35,427
After his father died,
he disappeared.

1335
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:39,973
Properties Reyes owned
before he died.

1336
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:42,601
Now all sold and repo'd.

1337
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:44,228
Except this one.

1338
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:47,940
The police station.

1339
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:50,234
It's been abandoned for years.

1340
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:52,694
And guess whose name
is on the deed.

1341
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:55,781
Dante Reyes.

1342
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:58,158
I'll find my answer there.

1343
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:02,955
I'm coming with you.

1344
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:08,377
I need you to stay safe.

1345
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:16,301
I would have won that race,
you know.

1346
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:18,637
So you want a rematch?

1347
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:21,014
-I'm demanding it.

1348
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:23,809
So I guess I'll see you soon.

1349
01:24:55,382 --> 01:24:57,884
Guys, you don't want to do this.

1350
01:24:57,884 --> 01:25:00,178
He needs a new watch, cop.

1351
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:01,680
Look, the watch was a gift.

1352
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,224
But I got 16 carats of
uncut diamonds in my jockstrap

1353
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:05,976
if you want to take a look.

1354
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:18,989
Now you really do need
a new watch.

1355
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:25,954
Damn it.

1356
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:36,757
B, you okay?

1357
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:40,344
Tried gum? Gum helps.

1358
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:42,721
I don't like planes.

1359
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:45,515
If it's the height,
that's gonna be an issue.

1360
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:49,061
You know, I used to be
scared of cars.

1361
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:53,732
After my dad died,
I guess I blamed myself.

1362
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:54,900
It was tough.

1363
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,486
I had panic attacks,
the whole bit.

1364
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:58,987
Heck, I took the bus.

1365
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:01,907
Yeah. I think I was just
so worried about making mistakes

1366
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:04,993
and not being
as good as my brother.

1367
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:06,578
-You?
-Uh, excuse me.

1368
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:08,288
Have you met your dad?

1369
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:10,332
He casts a pretty big shadow.

1370
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:15,837
Huh. Feeling better?

1371
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:17,047
-Yeah.
-Good.

1372
01:26:17,047 --> 01:26:18,799
Me, too.

1373
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:26,473
Here's the drink
that you ordered, sir.

1374
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:30,894
You know her?

1375
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:33,939
Yeah, it's good to have friends
in high places.

1376
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:35,732
On the count of three,

1377
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:38,276
we're gonna get up
and go to the bathroom. Ready?

1378
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:40,695
-Three.

1379
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:16,982
Who were those guys?

1380
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:19,568
Agency. They found us.
Now let's lose our tail.

1381
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:29,911
Holy shi...

1382
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:34,332
Wait! Swearing is for song
lyrics only and stubbed toes.

1383
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:35,834
Forget about it. Pay attention.

1384
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:38,086
Okay?
We're-we're too high to glide,

1385
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:41,423
so we need thrust,
which means, uh,

1386
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:43,550
combustion, which means...?

1387
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:48,513
Oxygen and fuel.

1388
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:49,598
Alcohol.

1389
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:50,849
-Um...
-Huh?

1390
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:52,184
Oh.

1391
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:00,859
That's rosé. Not gonna work.

1392
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:02,652
Long story.
But good initiative.

1393
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:15,457
I'm glad it wasn't the height.

1394
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:17,125
Enjoy the ride, Little B.

1395
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:31,223
Bowie tagged us.

1396
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:32,599
The agency is on our tail.

1397
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:33,934
We need to find gear

1398
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:36,061
and get to the rendezvous
as soon as possible.

1399
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:37,395
It's right here.

1400
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:40,607
You guys hold back.
Let me take care of this.

1401
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:42,859
No, no, no.
Th-That's a bad idea.

1402
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:45,612
-I mean like Roman-level bad.
-What?

1403
01:28:45,612 --> 01:28:46,738
What are you talking about, man?

1404
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:48,156
You heard what I said.

1405
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:50,242
Look, bro, you don't
have to do this, man.

1406
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:51,826
You know I got your back.

1407
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:53,036
We got your back.

1408
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:58,583
-I got to do this alone.

1409
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:19,688
I have something
to talk to you about.

1410
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:23,275
The only reason a dead guy
shows up at my door:

1411
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:24,442
revenge.

1412
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:30,407
Oh, shi...

1413
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:36,037
-Oh, shit.
-Shit. Han!

1414
01:29:37,289 --> 01:29:39,416
Should have stayed dead.

1415
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:41,376
I can get in. I can get in.

1416
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:43,837
I don't like repeating myself.

1417
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:46,172
You ruined my snacks.

1418
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:52,929
Relax.
I don't want to fight you.

1419
01:29:52,929 --> 01:29:54,931
Then this is gonna end quick.

1420
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:33,553
You bring more men to kill me?

1421
01:30:33,553 --> 01:30:35,597
They're trying to kill me, too.

1422
01:30:36,306 --> 01:30:38,683
Well, it looks like
we got more company.

1423
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:41,394
-You still drive?
-What do you think?

1424
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:46,858
Okay, just give me a second.

1425
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:48,026
Freeze!

1426
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:13,134
-Drop the laptop!
-Okay.

1427
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:40,704
-Guys, I'm in.

1428
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:53,842
No, no, no, no!

1429
01:31:58,096 --> 01:31:59,639
Now we're even.

1430
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:07,522
You okay?

1431
01:32:22,162 --> 01:32:25,874
Now, see, I understand all this.

1432
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:27,292
What the hell was that?

1433
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:34,132
You got scared. I saw that.

1434
01:32:34,132 --> 01:32:37,177
-Ain't nobody got scared, bruh.
-No, you were... he was scared.

1435
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:53,985
We have an unwanted guest.

1436
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:55,278
My family?

1437
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:56,738
They're safe for now.

1438
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:57,989
You're not afraid of anything.

1439
01:32:57,989 --> 01:32:59,574
I don't care about dying.

1440
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:02,577
I only care about protecting
the people that I love.

1441
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:03,745
Hold us in your heart

1442
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:05,455
and you will never
lose your way.

1443
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:06,748
You're not afraid of anything.

1444
01:33:06,748 --> 01:33:08,416
Fear can be a great teacher.

1445
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:10,084
You're not afraid of anything.

1446
01:33:24,224 --> 01:33:26,017
How do you like my place?

1447
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:29,521
I'm bummed I'm not there
to show you around.

1448
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:31,856
And a little embarrassed
you saw my vision board.

1449
01:33:33,316 --> 01:33:35,151
But at least you know
how hard I've been working

1450
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:36,611
to get us to this point.

1451
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:38,363
Now I know you're a dead man.

1452
01:33:38,363 --> 01:33:39,781
You mean resurrected.

1453
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:41,407
Thanks to you.

1454
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:43,159
You know, if you never would
have gotten behind that wheel,

1455
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:46,037
I'd never be the man
that I am today.

1456
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:48,122
You built such a beautiful life,

1457
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:51,167
filled with love and family.

1458
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:52,794
I never got that chance.

1459
01:33:52,794 --> 01:33:56,798
Collateral damage, chaos, death.

1460
01:33:56,798 --> 01:33:58,132
This is your legacy.

1461
01:33:58,132 --> 01:33:59,425
I'm your legacy.

1462
01:33:59,425 --> 01:34:01,219
You know what
I can't figure out?

1463
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:05,306
How someone born so rich

1464
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:08,893
chooses the poorest path
through life.

1465
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:10,562
You got no honor.

1466
01:34:10,562 --> 01:34:14,357
Without honor,
you got no family.

1467
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:17,402
And without family...

1468
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:21,614
...you've got nothing.

1469
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:23,616
I have nothing because of you.

1470
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:26,160
My future. My family.

1471
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,746
You stole that from me.

1472
01:34:28,746 --> 01:34:31,499
And now I'm gonna break yours,

1473
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:34,252
piece by piece.

1474
01:34:34,252 --> 01:34:36,546
Stop talking and face me.

1475
01:34:36,546 --> 01:34:38,131
Do you like surprises, Dommy?

1476
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:40,717
I adore them.

1477
01:34:42,427 --> 01:34:44,053
But the game's not over yet.

1478
01:34:44,053 --> 01:34:46,347
There's still
so many people to hurt.

1479
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:50,977
I'm coming for you.

1480
01:34:50,977 --> 01:34:53,271
Well, that's gonna be
hard to do in handcuffs.

1481
01:34:53,271 --> 01:34:55,481
Okay, bye, Dommy.

1482
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:57,442
No, you hang up first.

1483
01:34:57,442 --> 01:34:58,610
Okay.

1484
01:35:09,037 --> 01:35:10,371
Toretto, freeze.

1485
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:13,041
Time to face the music, Dom.

1486
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:15,585
You're playing
right into his hands, cop.

1487
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:54,374
Okay. Come on.

1488
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:58,002
Oh.

1489
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:02,507
Yeah.

1490
01:36:12,850 --> 01:36:15,019
Great.

1491
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:17,188
Just great.

1492
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:19,023
Shit.

1493
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:28,199
Little chilly?

1494
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:31,035
Your plan still sucks.

1495
01:36:31,035 --> 01:36:33,830
Maybe, but at least
you'll be warm.

1496
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:37,792
"Thank you, Cipher. Thank you."

1497
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:47,552
-Oh, wow.

1498
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:48,928
Take a look at this.

1499
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:50,763
This should cover us
in the gear department.

1500
01:36:50,763 --> 01:36:52,557
You are not to be trusted.

1501
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:56,227
Hey, you ain't
on my Christmas list either.

1502
01:36:58,396 --> 01:37:00,773
Nothing here is for free.
Let me be clear on that.

1503
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:02,608
Make sure you get a receipt
from him, okay?

1504
01:37:02,608 --> 01:37:03,943
I'd love to see that.

1505
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:05,820
-Well, I guess Bowie

1506
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:07,822
wasn't entirely worthless.
I can use his hard drive

1507
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:09,282
to complete our trace of Dante.

1508
01:37:09,282 --> 01:37:11,743
He's been ten moves ahead of us
this whole time.

1509
01:37:11,743 --> 01:37:13,369
How does he do it by himself?

1510
01:37:13,369 --> 01:37:14,996
Uh, this isn't good.

1511
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:17,331
Our money, it's been split into
accounts all over the world.

1512
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:19,500
And look
who they're registered to.

1513
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,170
Those are mercenary kill teams.
Real scum.

1514
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:23,921
He used our money
to buy an army.

1515
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:25,840
So this guy doesn't
just want us dead.

1516
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,300
He wants to erase us
off the planet.

1517
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:28,801
He's trying to tear us apart.

1518
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:30,762
That's exactly why we need
to link back up with Dom

1519
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:32,889
at the rendezvous point.

1520
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:37,852
You need to see this.

1521
01:37:39,771 --> 01:37:41,606
They've been paid to target us

1522
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:44,942
and anyone who ever helped us
until now.

1523
01:37:47,862 --> 01:37:49,405
Mum.

1524
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:14,180
I'll have transport
waiting for you.

1525
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:16,474
And where are you going?

1526
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:18,059
I'm gonna dig some graves.

1527
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:30,696
Mr. Nobody's golden boy,

1528
01:38:30,696 --> 01:38:32,740
caught without
so much as a fight.

1529
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,492
That's no fun.

1530
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:36,410
It's like going
all the way to Everest

1531
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:38,162
and taking the elevator.

1532
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:41,165
You might want to buckle up.

1533
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:44,377
I know you did some good work
for the agency.

1534
01:38:44,377 --> 01:38:47,338
I'm sure you figured
that buys you some leniency.

1535
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:49,298
But it's a new day.

1536
01:38:49,298 --> 01:38:52,593
That's the problem nowadays.
Nobody listens.

1537
01:38:56,013 --> 01:38:58,683
You should have spent less time
with your head under the hood

1538
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:00,977
and more time preparing
for what's coming.

1539
01:39:00,977 --> 01:39:03,563
Spies have been replaced
by satellites,

1540
01:39:03,563 --> 01:39:08,526
fighter pilots by drones,
intelligence by an algorithm.

1541
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:11,362
The days where one man
behind the wheel of a car

1542
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:14,282
can make a difference
are over, Dom.

1543
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:16,951
Hell, the days of any man

1544
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:18,995
behind the wheel of a car
are over.

1545
01:39:22,206 --> 01:39:23,332
What are you doing?

1546
01:39:23,332 --> 01:39:25,877
Preparing for what's to come.

1547
01:39:25,877 --> 01:39:27,879
Right.

1548
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:46,647
Go. Go. Go.

1549
01:40:03,873 --> 01:40:08,044
Dominic, I brought you back
to where we first met.

1550
01:40:08,044 --> 01:40:09,837
And I have a surprise for you.

1551
01:40:36,322 --> 01:40:37,448
Dom!

1552
01:40:38,574 --> 01:40:40,701
I'm listening now.

1553
01:41:14,652 --> 01:41:16,070
Dominic?

1554
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:17,363
Dominic!

1555
01:41:17,363 --> 01:41:19,198
Would you stop hurting
my new friends?

1556
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:21,867
No. I'm only here to hurt you.

1557
01:41:21,867 --> 01:41:22,827
Oh.

1558
01:41:22,827 --> 01:41:25,454
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1559
01:41:25,454 --> 01:41:27,081
That little car stunt
you just did?

1560
01:41:27,081 --> 01:41:28,249
That was pretty awesome.

1561
01:41:28,249 --> 01:41:29,417
Wasn't it?

1562
01:41:29,417 --> 01:41:30,835
It was so cool.

1563
01:41:30,835 --> 01:41:32,878
But if you don't stop,

1564
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:36,090
I'm gonna cut her everywhere.

1565
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:37,383
Badly.

1566
01:41:42,805 --> 01:41:44,557
There she is.

1567
01:41:44,557 --> 01:41:47,018
-Hmm.
-Fashionably late.

1568
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:49,228
You got me.

1569
01:41:50,271 --> 01:41:52,189
Mmm.

1570
01:41:52,189 --> 01:41:54,525
-Off you go.

1571
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:58,029
Family.

1572
01:42:00,406 --> 01:42:03,242
Will you please get off my car?

1573
01:42:05,286 --> 01:42:06,954
-Hmm.

1574
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:08,789
That is so disrespectful.

1575
01:42:08,789 --> 01:42:10,541
You talk too much.

1576
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:25,556
Stop, stop!

1577
01:42:25,556 --> 01:42:27,016
You don't know
your own strength.

1578
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:32,563
You butthole!

1579
01:42:32,563 --> 01:42:34,607
Oh, hey.

1580
01:42:35,733 --> 01:42:37,777
Do you like ballet?

1581
01:42:37,777 --> 01:42:39,487
I adore Swan Lake.

1582
01:42:39,487 --> 01:42:41,447
I feel like you're more of a--
kind of a Nutcracker guy.

1583
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:44,617
And a one, and a two,
and...

1584
01:42:46,452 --> 01:42:47,995
No!

1585
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:55,669
Wait for it.

1586
01:42:58,339 --> 01:42:59,924
Oh, no.

1587
01:42:59,924 --> 01:43:02,551
She's in peril.
What will you do?

1588
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:06,389
You know what your problem is?

1589
01:43:07,973 --> 01:43:10,726
Family.

1590
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:13,437
You can't save 'em all.

1591
01:43:14,730 --> 01:43:17,608
Five. Four.

1592
01:43:17,608 --> 01:43:19,110
Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta.

1593
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:20,611
Go on.

1594
01:43:20,611 --> 01:43:22,029
Two.

1595
01:43:33,916 --> 01:43:35,709
You don't like ballet.

1596
01:43:35,709 --> 01:43:37,545
I can feel it.

1597
01:43:37,545 --> 01:43:39,463
May I please have the God's Eye?

1598
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:41,048
-Screw you.
-No?

1599
01:43:41,048 --> 01:43:42,133
Pretty please?

1600
01:43:43,509 --> 01:43:44,844
-Oh, there it is.

1601
01:43:44,844 --> 01:43:47,138
Ooh. Gotcha.

1602
01:43:47,972 --> 01:43:50,349
Good trade. Keep the car.

1603
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:52,101
Oh, Dommy!

1604
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:57,481
I told you,
you owe me suffering!

1605
01:43:57,481 --> 01:43:59,984
Your legacy isn't money or power

1606
01:43:59,984 --> 01:44:02,570
or the family you built
or the life you led.

1607
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:05,739
It's the life you made.

1608
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:09,118
And a father and his son...

1609
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:10,369
is everything.

1610
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:12,538
You killed my father
on this bridge.

1611
01:44:12,538 --> 01:44:16,333
And now I know
where to find your son.

1612
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:20,379
Enchanté.

1613
01:44:29,513 --> 01:44:32,892
You're gonna be okay, Tess.
It went clear through.

1614
01:44:32,892 --> 01:44:34,351
Kinda hurts.

1615
01:44:34,351 --> 01:44:36,520
Your father would be proud.

1616
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:38,522
Yeah.

1617
01:44:38,522 --> 01:44:40,900
You will stop him.

1618
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:43,819
Have faith.

1619
01:44:55,372 --> 01:44:56,916
She needs a hospital.

1620
01:44:56,916 --> 01:44:58,751
Mm.

1621
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,105
You're gonna be okay.

1622
01:45:20,105 --> 01:45:21,732
I got her.

1623
01:45:21,732 --> 01:45:23,275
Go save your son.

1624
01:45:24,485 --> 01:45:26,529
My nephew.

1625
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:43,671
I'm not gonna say I'm sorry,
so let me do you one better.

1626
01:45:43,671 --> 01:45:46,006
Let's get your son.

1636
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,374
So, it used to be an old mine,

1637
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:22,918
and they blasted tunnels
deep into the mountain.

1638
01:46:22,918 --> 01:46:26,255
And I just, uh...

1639
01:46:26,255 --> 01:46:27,756
repurposed the place.

1640
01:46:27,756 --> 01:46:30,092
You just got to keep yourself
open to possibilities.

1641
01:46:30,092 --> 01:46:33,470
And, of course, (sighs) have
a lot of time on your hands.

1642
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:35,973
You said we'd meet him here.

1643
01:46:41,103 --> 01:46:42,229
Hey.

1644
01:46:43,856 --> 01:46:44,815
You know your dad.

1645
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:47,151
He's got to make it safe.

1646
01:46:47,151 --> 01:46:48,652
We'll just wait.

1647
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:54,241
I love you, Uncle Jakob.

1648
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:03,292
What's that?

1649
01:47:03,292 --> 01:47:06,587
That? Ah, project
I've been working on.

1650
01:47:06,587 --> 01:47:08,797
You wouldn't be interested.

1651
01:47:20,517 --> 01:47:23,187
All right, we're entering
Portuguese airspace.

1652
01:47:23,187 --> 01:47:25,648
Jakob's already there.
Any word from Dom?

1653
01:47:27,983 --> 01:47:29,943
Hey.

1654
01:47:29,943 --> 01:47:32,321
Why are you so quiet?
You all right?

1655
01:47:32,321 --> 01:47:34,698
Just been sitting here
thinking, man.

1656
01:47:34,698 --> 01:47:36,158
I knew I smelled
something burning in here.

1657
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:40,496
Tej, it was my mission,
y'all took my lead,

1658
01:47:40,496 --> 01:47:43,123
and I messed this thing up
every step of the way.

1659
01:47:43,123 --> 01:47:45,959
I guess this whole...

1660
01:47:45,959 --> 01:47:48,087
leadership thing
really ain't for me.

1661
01:47:48,087 --> 01:47:51,090
You took us to London
on a container.

1662
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:54,093
You spent thousands of dollars
of your own cash,

1663
01:47:54,093 --> 01:47:56,095
strapped to your ass,

1664
01:47:56,095 --> 01:47:58,639
that now smells like
cheap cologne.

1665
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,724
Now you're sitting here
taking sole responsibility

1666
01:48:00,724 --> 01:48:02,893
for something that we all wear.

1667
01:48:02,893 --> 01:48:04,561
Yeah, I know. It sounds stupid.

1668
01:48:04,561 --> 01:48:05,938
Nah, it don't sound stupid
at all.

1669
01:48:05,938 --> 01:48:07,398
You know what
it sounds like to me?

1670
01:48:07,398 --> 01:48:09,858
That sounds like a leader.

1671
01:48:18,909 --> 01:48:21,161
Come on, man.
Get your ass up, man.

1672
01:48:22,496 --> 01:48:24,581
I love you, man.

1673
01:48:24,581 --> 01:48:25,874
I love you, too, bro.

1674
01:48:25,874 --> 01:48:28,961
Sometimes we got to say,
"I'm sorry."

1675
01:48:28,961 --> 01:48:30,671
I'm sorry for
whupping your ass, man,

1676
01:48:30,671 --> 01:48:32,673
'cause I didn't really mean
to do that.

1677
01:48:32,673 --> 01:48:34,425
-The whole thing, it would've
been a whole dif... -

1678
01:48:34,425 --> 01:48:36,593
-You okay? What's wrong?

1679
01:48:36,593 --> 01:48:38,929
I'm just allergic
to your bullshit.

1680
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:40,472
-Come on.

1681
01:48:43,767 --> 01:48:46,437
Hey, go easy there.
You're gonna break that thing.

1682
01:48:46,437 --> 01:48:48,230
-You all right?

1683
01:48:48,230 --> 01:48:49,982
God's Eye was just used to send

1684
01:48:49,982 --> 01:48:52,067
dozens of mercenaries
after Dom's son.

1685
01:48:52,067 --> 01:48:56,780
Something I created
hurting the people we love.

1686
01:48:59,575 --> 01:49:01,493
It was meant to help.

1687
01:49:01,493 --> 01:49:03,912
This is bigger than just Dante.

1688
01:49:03,912 --> 01:49:05,873
This is bigger than just us.

1689
01:49:05,873 --> 01:49:08,709
We have to stop
this monster now.

1690
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:24,016
We got to go.

1691
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:46,747
Hold on!

1692
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:58,342
I got eyes on
Uncle Muscle and the kid.

1693
01:49:58,342 --> 01:50:00,344
All right, everybody,
remember the plan.

1694
01:50:00,344 --> 01:50:02,805
Contain and kidnap. Thank you.

1695
01:50:02,805 --> 01:50:04,515
No.

1696
01:50:04,515 --> 01:50:05,682
No guns.

1697
01:50:05,682 --> 01:50:07,935
I need this little shit alive.

1698
01:50:07,935 --> 01:50:09,478
At least for a while.

1699
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:41,218
-You ready?
-Ready.

1700
01:50:58,151 --> 01:50:59,820
Holy sh...

1701
01:51:00,529 --> 01:51:02,155
Oh, no, you're good.
You're good.

1702
01:51:02,155 --> 01:51:04,825
Okay, uh, song lyrics,
stubbed toes and cannon cars.

1703
01:51:04,825 --> 01:51:05,993
Yeah.

1704
01:51:10,455 --> 01:51:12,207
Here we go!

1705
01:52:03,634 --> 01:52:05,302
It's stuck. It's stuck.

1706
01:52:08,722 --> 01:52:10,098
They got an army
down there, Dom.

1707
01:52:10,098 --> 01:52:11,975
Your team's not far out.

1708
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:13,977
-Bring us down.
-I can't put her down here.

1709
01:52:13,977 --> 01:52:15,812
There's an airfield
seven klicks west.

1710
01:52:15,812 --> 01:52:18,023
Okay, we'll meet you there.
Now open the back.

1711
01:52:18,023 --> 01:52:20,901
Dom, there's really
nowhere to land.

1712
01:52:22,694 --> 01:52:25,072
Who said anything about landing?

1713
01:52:42,589 --> 01:52:44,257
Look.

1714
01:52:50,263 --> 01:52:52,099
I'm coming for you, son.

1715
01:53:01,316 --> 01:53:02,776
What the...

1716
01:53:32,973 --> 01:53:35,058
-Dad!
-Hey, son.

1717
01:53:35,058 --> 01:53:36,893
Good to see you, big bro.

1718
01:53:36,893 --> 01:53:39,646
Good to see you guys.
Follow me to that plane.

1719
01:53:39,646 --> 01:53:41,440
We're right behind you.

1720
01:53:43,984 --> 01:53:45,527
I got you now.

1721
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:55,495
Aimes, we're on our way.

1722
01:53:55,495 --> 01:53:58,498
Dom, I'll be touching down
five klicks west.

1723
01:53:58,498 --> 01:53:59,958
But they're still on your tail.

1724
01:54:01,877 --> 01:54:03,462
It's jammed.

1725
01:54:07,257 --> 01:54:09,926
B, what are you doing?

1726
01:54:11,928 --> 01:54:13,305
Careful.

1727
01:54:14,931 --> 01:54:16,308
Okay, okay, okay.

1728
01:54:24,775 --> 01:54:27,861
Shut the front door.

1729
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:29,279
Little B.

1730
01:54:36,286 --> 01:54:38,622
Uncle Jakob!

1731
01:54:38,622 --> 01:54:40,624
I fixed it!

1732
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:47,005
B!

1733
01:54:47,005 --> 01:54:48,507
Toodle-oo.

1734
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:51,802
-Help!
-Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta. Shut up.

1735
01:54:51,802 --> 01:54:53,136
Damn it.

1736
01:54:53,136 --> 01:54:55,180
You party? I party.

1737
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:56,973
- Whoa.

1738
01:54:58,016 --> 01:55:00,727
Dom, I lost him.
Dante has Little B.

1739
01:55:20,247 --> 01:55:22,749
Hey, Dominic.
Welcome to the big showdown.

1740
01:55:22,749 --> 01:55:25,043
It's the last lap.
Check out my copilot.

1741
01:55:25,043 --> 01:55:27,879
-Dad!
-Who could've seen this coming?

1742
01:55:27,879 --> 01:55:29,798
I mean, you know, except for me.

1743
01:55:46,857 --> 01:55:49,568
Shit. Looks like
my fuel line's been shot.

1744
01:55:50,735 --> 01:55:54,156
-I can't get to him, Dom.
-Jakob, stay with me.

1745
01:55:54,156 --> 01:55:56,658
I'm out of this race.

1746
01:55:56,658 --> 01:55:58,118
It has to be you.

1747
01:55:58,118 --> 01:56:01,288
Hey, Dom!
Got a little surprise for you.

1748
01:56:11,256 --> 01:56:13,717
You raised a hell of a son, Dom.

1749
01:56:13,717 --> 01:56:16,803
Time for me to step out
from under your shadow.

1750
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:19,556
Thanks for showing me the light.

1751
01:56:19,556 --> 01:56:20,849
Jakob?

1752
01:56:20,849 --> 01:56:22,350
I'm gonna go clear the way.

1753
01:56:23,727 --> 01:56:25,812
Go get your son.

1754
01:56:25,812 --> 01:56:27,230
Jakob, don't!

1755
01:56:27,230 --> 01:56:29,149
-Don't!

1756
01:56:38,116 --> 01:56:39,534
Uncle Jakob!

1757
01:57:03,808 --> 01:57:07,062
Looks like Uncle Muscle won't be
coming to the next barbecue.

1758
01:57:07,062 --> 01:57:09,105
Oh.

1759
01:57:09,105 --> 01:57:10,774
I mean, it's very honorable.

1760
01:57:12,234 --> 01:57:14,611
Three miles away.
Take the service road.

1761
01:57:14,611 --> 01:57:16,196
It'll lead you
right to the airfield.

1762
01:57:27,707 --> 01:57:30,418
You know how to beat your dad
in a street race?

1763
01:57:37,759 --> 01:57:39,177
Take away the streets.

1764
01:57:39,177 --> 01:57:40,929
-Dad!

1765
01:57:46,685 --> 01:57:48,645
Amazing.

1766
01:57:48,645 --> 01:57:49,771
Oh.

1767
01:58:03,118 --> 01:58:05,704
We got it.
We got it.

1768
01:58:13,586 --> 01:58:14,587
My turn.

1769
01:58:38,945 --> 01:58:41,573
He's good. Your dad's good.

1770
01:58:46,786 --> 01:58:48,371
Dom, you got one mile left.

1771
01:58:48,371 --> 01:58:51,416
Son, I never break a promise.

1772
01:58:51,416 --> 01:58:54,878
Now, let's finish
that driving lesson.

1773
01:58:54,878 --> 01:58:56,463
Feel the car,

1774
01:58:56,463 --> 01:58:58,298
find your line

1775
01:58:58,298 --> 01:58:59,549
and fly.

1776
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:21,946
-Oh!

1777
01:59:36,169 --> 01:59:38,338
-Now!

1778
01:59:51,935 --> 01:59:53,103
No.

1779
01:59:55,105 --> 01:59:56,439
Take the service road now.

1780
02:00:04,697 --> 02:00:06,699
-I'm wheels down.
-We're headed to you now.

1781
02:00:06,699 --> 02:00:08,701
Your team is on their way.

1782
02:00:08,701 --> 02:00:10,328
I'll meet you at the airfield.

1783
02:00:10,328 --> 02:00:12,539
-You okay?
-I'm good, Dad.

1784
02:00:12,539 --> 02:00:14,749
I'm real proud of you, son.

1785
02:01:00,044 --> 02:01:02,464
Oh, Dommy boy.

1786
02:01:02,464 --> 02:01:04,257
It's so good to see you again.

1787
02:01:04,257 --> 02:01:06,718
Did you hit me with
a helicopter back there?

1788
02:01:06,718 --> 02:01:08,219
Hmm.

1789
02:01:08,219 --> 02:01:11,014
Ow, you big brute.
I mean, I get it.

1790
02:01:11,014 --> 02:01:13,349
You're showing off
in front of your son.

1791
02:01:13,349 --> 02:01:14,851
But honestly,
did you really think

1792
02:01:14,851 --> 02:01:17,812
it was going to be that easy?

1793
02:01:17,812 --> 02:01:20,190
You're exactly
where I wanted you to be.

1794
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:22,108
Yes.

1795
02:01:22,108 --> 02:01:23,860
Wait for it.

1796
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:26,279
I got a surprise for you.

1797
02:01:32,994 --> 02:01:35,580
The cavalry's here.
We got you, Dom.

1798
02:01:36,915 --> 02:01:39,042
Roman, get out of here.
It's a trap.

1799
02:01:42,837 --> 02:01:44,380
Incoming!

1800
02:01:59,395 --> 02:02:00,855
Yes!

1801
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:04,484
See, that's the problem
with having a big family.

1802
02:02:08,112 --> 02:02:09,948
Can't protect 'em all.

1803
02:02:15,245 --> 02:02:16,496
Ooh!

1804
02:02:16,496 --> 02:02:18,831
Oh, Dominic,
is that your new friend?

1805
02:02:19,624 --> 02:02:21,167
Aw.

1806
02:02:21,167 --> 02:02:22,919
You are so predictable.

1807
02:02:22,919 --> 02:02:26,256
You think everyone's gonna
end up on your side?

1808
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:29,467
Problem is Aimes was mine first.

1809
02:02:29,467 --> 02:02:32,762
Now the work begins.

1810
02:02:32,762 --> 02:02:34,389
And in there,

1811
02:02:34,389 --> 02:02:37,392
today we'll put our family
on a path to real power.

1812
02:02:38,935 --> 02:02:40,144
Let's get started.

1813
02:02:49,529 --> 02:02:51,197
Well, looks like
our partnership's

1814
02:02:51,197 --> 02:02:53,533
off to a fantastic start.

1815
02:02:56,494 --> 02:02:59,330
You know, Dominic,
to become a real saint,

1816
02:02:59,330 --> 02:03:01,124
you have to perform miracles.

1817
02:03:01,124 --> 02:03:03,209
Or die a martyr.

1818
02:03:03,209 --> 02:03:05,420
So what's it gonna be?

1819
02:03:13,428 --> 02:03:17,307
I took your money,
I took your freedom,

1820
02:03:17,307 --> 02:03:19,392
and I'm gonna take your family.

1821
02:03:20,018 --> 02:03:21,477
And you're gonna die

1822
02:03:21,477 --> 02:03:23,646
knowing that
you couldn't save your son.

1823
02:03:26,608 --> 02:03:28,651
Dad.

1824
02:03:28,651 --> 02:03:30,570
I have faith.

1825
02:03:38,077 --> 02:03:40,830
You made one mistake.

1826
02:03:41,789 --> 02:03:43,916
You never took my car.

1827
02:04:04,187 --> 02:04:05,313
Oh!

1828
02:06:03,806 --> 02:06:05,558
The suffering is over, Dom.

1829
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:13,191
It's time for you to die.

1830
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:14,669
No way.

1831
02:07:15,628 --> 02:07:17,380
Still think my plan sucks?

1893
02:10:39,373 --> 02:10:40,999
Howdy, partner.

1894
02:10:40,999 --> 02:10:43,169
Do you like surprises?

1895
02:10:43,169 --> 02:10:46,672
You've done some dastardly,
dirty deeds, Sheriff.

1896
02:10:46,672 --> 02:10:49,759
You took the most important
thing in my life from me.

1897
02:10:56,932 --> 02:10:59,060
Dom drove the car.

1898
02:10:59,810 --> 02:11:02,480
-But you...
- Help me.

1899
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:05,024
...you pulled the trigger.

1900
02:11:06,442 --> 02:11:08,402
