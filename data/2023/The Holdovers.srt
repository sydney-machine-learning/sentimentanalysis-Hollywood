Higher voices are excellent.

Mr. Hunham?

I'm busy right now.

53
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,940
Uh, Dr. Woodrup
asked to see you.

00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,887
What does he want?

55
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,324
Uh, I think it's
about Christmas break.

56
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,193
I'll see him presently.

57
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:54,461
What's that?

58
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,497
Christmas cookies.

59
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,165
I made them for the faculty.

60
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,867
Well, not all the faculty.

61
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,072

What are you doing
with women's underwear?

72
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,649
It's the same swimsuit
James Bond wears

73
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,284
in <i>On Her Majesty's</i>
<i>Secret Service.</i>

74
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,984
It can't get more masculine
than that.

75
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,154
Why don't you just wear cutoffs?

76
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,622
Because I'm going to St. Kitts.

77
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,358
I'm not going to be
the only dickhead

78
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,592
on the beach wearing cutoffs.

79
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,927
Oh. Look out, everyone.

80
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,962
Tully's going to St. Kitts.

81
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,498
They still look like panties.

82
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,401
You're right, Crandall.
You caught me.

83
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,036
They're your mother's panties.

84
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,238
Tell her thanks
for the good times!

85
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,506
Hey, Tully.

86
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,241
Hey, where are my cigarettes?

87
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,409
Your cigarettes?

88
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:16,909
You stole my fucking cigarettes.

89
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,345
I resent
that baseless accusation.

90
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,413
Cut the shit.

91
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,014
I have no cigarettes now.

92
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,616
And Briggs says you suddenly
had five of them

93
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,051
to trade for a skin mag.

94
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,918
I don't indulge in pornography.

95
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,621
I get enough of the real thing.

96
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,922
Especially with Crandall's mom!

97
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,059
Hey, Kountze.

98
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,527
Ten dollars for this?

99
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,129
Looks more like a nickel bag.

100
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:36,996
Don't buy that, Harriman.
He's ripping you off.

101
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,199
-Plus, it's ditch weed.
-Fuck you, Tully.

102
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,268
This shit's premium weed,
all right?

103
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,070
And unlike you, I'm stuck here.

104
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,605
It's got to last me
through Christmas.

105
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,340
Take pity on him, Harriman.

106
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,542
He's a poor little Christmas
orphan with nowhere to go.

107
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,045
Little Christmas orphan
needs his pot and porn.

108
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,726

109
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,927

I thought this was your year.

124
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:30,777
It was.

125
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:33,347
I told Woodrup
my mother has lupus.

126
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,648
Does she?

127
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,251
I don't know. Probably.

128
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:39,520
We don't talk
about those things.

129
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,388
So, who got stuck with it?

130
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,223
Who do you think?

131
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:48,095
That poor walleyed bastard.

132
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,549
Rémy Martin. Louis XIII.

133
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:11,118
Christmas gift from
the Board of Trustees.

134
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,153
Oh, how generous of them.

135
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,255
Thank you again
for doing this, Hunham.

136
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,691
I wouldn't have asked
if it weren't an emergency.

137
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,427
Oh, Mr. Endicott's mother,
right.

138
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,595
What a tragedy.

139
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:25,332
It's not as though you had plans
to leave campus anyway.

140
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:28,335
And, of course, there's a nice
little bonus in it for you.

141
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:33,206
Well... <i>"Non nobis</i>
<i>solum nati sumus,"</i> I suppose.

142
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,211
"Not for ourselves alone
are we born."

143
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,349
I'm guessing that's Cicero.

144
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,117
Cicero, yes.

145
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:47,087
Very good, Hardy.
You remembered.

146
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,663
There'll be just four boys
holding over this year.

147
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,899
Mm-hmm.

148
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,702
Oh, yes. I know
a couple of these reprobates.

149
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:06,573
Let's be a little more elastic
in our assessment, shall we?

150
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:09,343
It's hard enough for them to be
away from home on the holidays.

151
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:12,212
Latitude is the last thing
these boys need.

152
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:17,618
Paul, at your core,
you're an excellent teacher,

153
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:20,854
but your approach to the
students is rather traditional.

154
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,689
This school was founded in 1797.

155
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,425
I thought tradition
was our stock in trade.

156
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,294
-Then let's call it hidebound.
-Ah.

157
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,630
You know, unwavering,
resistant to...

158
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:32,432
Yes, yes, yes, I know
what "hidebound" means.

159
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,368
Uh, I get it.

160
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,270
You're still angry
that I failed Jordan Osgood.

161
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,640
Senator Osgood was very upset

162
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:42,509
when Princeton rescinded
Jordan's acceptance, yes.

163
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,778
And I've continued to
have to deal with the fallout.

164
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:48,415
Hardy, are we really supposed
to let these boys just skate by

165
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,784
as long as Daddy builds
a new gymnasium?

166
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,886
Of course not.
That's not who we are.

167
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,355
But we can't be ignorant
to politics.

168
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:58,258
That boy is too dumb
to pour piss out of a boot.

169
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,260
A genuine troglodyte.

170
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,329
Jesus Christ, Paul.

171
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,965
He was a legacy and the son
of one of our biggest donors.

172
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,867
Ever think his dad
might be expecting

173
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,702
a little consideration
for his dollar?

174
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:12,572
And he got it -- a first-class
education for his son.

175
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,274
Oh, come on, Hardy.

176
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:18,378
As Dr. Greene used to say,
"Our one true purpose

177
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:20,447
is to produce young men
of good character."

178
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,516
I don't care what
Dr. Greene used to say.

179
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,418
"And we cannot sacrifice
our integrity

180
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,386
on the altar
of their entitlement."

181
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,390
I'm just trying to instill
basic academic discipline.

182
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:32,859
That's my job. Isn't it yours?

183
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,728
It was.

184
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,563
Until I became headmaster

185
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:39,599
and saw that it's not so simple
to keep the damn school afloat.

186
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:43,937
I begged you, begged you
to give the kid a C minus.

187
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,439
No.

188
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:46,973
There are instructors here
who will do that.

189
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:49,409
I am not one of them.

190
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,717
Here's the manual
and a full set of keys.

191
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,919
Everything you need to know
is in there.

192
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,022
Your only task is to ensure

193
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:03,590
the boys' absolute safety
and good condition.

194
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:07,994
And at least pretend to be
a human being.

195
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:09,930
Please.

196
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,998
It's Christmas.

197
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,040
Fuck this half-day bullshit.

198
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:20,607
Where the hell is Walleye?

199
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,443
He's probably jerking off
in the Cobb salad.

200
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,379
-Why would he do that?
-Because he's Walleye.

201
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,548
Who knows what
that foul-smelling freak does?

202
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,784
But you went straight
to the Cobb salad.

203
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,919
I mean, do you know something?

204
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,022
Because I eat that Cobb salad.

205
00:12:35,056 --> 00:12:37,324
<i>Salve,</i> gentlemen.

206
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,826
Your final exams.

207
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,661
Hmm.

208
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,830
I can tell by your faces
that many of you

209
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:19,332
are shocked at the outcome.

210
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,868
I, on the other hand, am not,
because I have had

211
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:24,671
the misfortune
of teaching you this semester.

212
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:27,808
And even with
my ocular limitations,

213
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,676
I witnessed firsthand

214
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:33,380
your glazed,
uncomprehending expressions.

215
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,515
Sir, I don't understand.

216
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,450
That's glaringly apparent.

217
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,587
No, it's...
I can't fail this class.

218
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,823
Oh, don't sell yourself short,
Mr. Kountze.

219
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,825
I truly believe that you can.

220
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,860
I'm supposed to go to Cornell.

221
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,695
Unlikely.

222
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:51,431
Please, sir.
My dad's going to flip out.

223
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,572
All right. All right.

224
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,707
Uh, in the spirit of the season,

225
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,542
I suppose the most
constructive way

226
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:04,477
of dealing with
your shortcomings

227
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,881
is to offer a makeup exam.

228
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,650
You'll all get a second run
at this after break.

229
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:16,857
Of course, it will not
be the same exam.

230
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,126
You will now be responsible
for new material as well.

231
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,796
Your grade will be
an average of the two.

232
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,465
Please open your books
to chapter six.

233
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:28,435
The Peloponnesian War,
gentlemen.

234
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,870
You've already met Pericles.

235
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,606
Now prepare yourselves
to meet Demosthenes.

236
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,475
No offense, sir,
but is this really

237
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,611
the best time to be starting
a new chapter?

238
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:42,482
I mean, we all appreciate the,
uh, makeup exam gesture,

239
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:45,019
but our families are here.

240
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,487
You know, most teachers
have already canceled class.

241
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,723
We have chapel in 40 minutes,
then we're out of here.

242
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,559
-Mm. -I mean,
our heads are elsewhere.

243
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:56,030
And where exactly
is your head, Mr. Tully?

244
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,831
Um, I don't know.

245
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,100
St. Kitts.

246
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:01,601
Yes, indeed.

247
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,803
I see you've brought
your valise.

248
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:05,906
Spot-on, sir.

249
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:08,909
It's just that it's been
a really exhausting semester.

250
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:12,712
Getting into new material now
right before break?

251
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,782
Honestly, it's a little absurd.

252
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:16,983
Sir.

253
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,923
Well, I would hate to be absurd.

254
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:26,526
So let's just scuttle
the whole thing, shall we,

255
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,929
and let the original
grades stand.

256
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:32,732
Uh, excuse me, sir.

257
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,735
I think, uh, we all liked
the first option better.

258
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,771
What'd you say the guy's
name was? Uh, Demosthe-who?

259
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,207
Of course, I still expect you
to be familiar with chapter six

260
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:43,543
upon your return,
so pack those textbooks, boys.

261
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,545
And if displeased,

262
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:48,782
take it up with
your champion -- Mr. Tully.

263
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:51,518
Dismissed.

264
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,993
I got us out early, didn't I?

265
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:11,771
♪ Born thy people to deliver ♪

266
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:16,710
♪ Born a child and yet a king ♪

267
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:21,648
♪ Born to reign in us forever ♪

268
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:27,854
♪ Now thy gracious
kingdom bring. ♪

269
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,491
Please be seated.

270
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:37,597
Welcome, Barton students,
faculty and parents.

271
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,301
I know you're all anxious
to start the holidays.

272
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:43,270
I can see the boys
shifting in their seats.

273
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:45,139
But before we release you

274
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:48,608
to your bountiful tables
and the blessings of family,

275
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:51,544
let us pray for those
less fortunate than we.

276
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:56,017
Let us remember the poor
and the helpless,

277
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,153
the cold, the hungry
and the oppressed.

278
00:17:00,154 --> 00:17:02,756
Extra reading over vacation
and no makeup test?

279
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:04,624
Are you fucking kidding me?

280
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,027
Nice work, anus.

281
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,961
Can you not talk, please?
I'm trying to pray.

282
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,963
You better pray
I don't catch you alone,

283
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:12,932
because I will full-on
nut-punch you.

284
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:14,301
Tone it down.

285
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:16,303
- Jesus can hear you.
- ...and all those

286
00:17:16,337 --> 00:17:19,040
who know not
the loving kindness of God.

287
00:17:19,073 --> 00:17:21,308
Sorry to hear about
your mother, Endicott.

288
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:22,976
What?

289
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,012
Oh. Yes.

290
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:26,280
Thank you.

291
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,315
Yeah. We're all pulling for her.

292
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,949
...and your grace.

293
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:34,155
And finally, let us pray
for the soul of Curtis Lamb,

294
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:36,756
Barton class of 1969.

295
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,726
Just this year,
Curtis gave his life valiantly

296
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,861
in the service of his country.

297
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:45,132
And let us once again extend
our deepest condolences

298
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,202
to one of the most cherished
members of the Barton family,

299
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,037
his mother Mary.

300
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:53,040
Mary, we remember Curtis

301
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:55,775
as such an outstanding
and promising young man,

302
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,345
and we know this holiday season

303
00:17:58,379 --> 00:18:01,115
will be especially difficult
without him.

304
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:05,752
Please know that we
accompany you in your grief.

305
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,123
May the all-powerful God
who protected Abraham

306
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:13,027
when he left his native land
protect all our brave soldiers

307
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,363
until they are delivered
safely home to us.

308
00:18:16,397 --> 00:18:19,166
We ask this through
Christ our Lord.

309
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,633
Amen.

310
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,669
Amen.

311
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,072
I wish you all
a very Merry Christmas.

312
00:18:25,106 --> 00:18:28,708
Or, as the case may be,
a very Happy Hanukkah.

313
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:46,793
Congressman,
Merry Christmas to you.

314
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,931
Merry Christmas, everyone.

315
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,234
Merry Christmas.

316
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:54,667
Hey. Good to see you.

317
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,437
Nice to see you.
Merry Christmas.

318
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:04,811
Angus Tully.

319
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,913
You have a phone call.

320
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:13,920
<i>You're telling me this now?</i>

321
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,356
Sweetheart, listen.

322
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:17,424
I know it's last minute,
and I am...

323
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:19,426
I'm absolutely heartbroken,

324
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,095
but could you please
see your way

325
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:24,231
to staying at school over break
just this once?

326
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:26,066
Stanley has been working
so hard,

327
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,335
and-and we've had no time
for a honeymoon.

328
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:30,471
You guys have been married
since July.

329
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,173
You've had all these months.

330
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:33,840
Something's always come up.

331
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,775
I know it's a lot to ask,

332
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:38,312
but you know
how lonely I've been.

333
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,181
I've been lonely too.

334
00:19:40,214 --> 00:19:41,915
And what about Boston?

335
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:45,119
You promised on the way
we'd spend some time in Boston.

336
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:47,221
Angus, listen to me.

337
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:49,190
This is our new family, okay?

338
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:51,858
I know you miss your father--
I do, too--

339
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,261
but there's someone new
in my life.

340
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:56,463
It's just this once, darling.

341
00:19:56,497 --> 00:19:58,199
We'll be together
at spring break,

342
00:19:58,232 --> 00:19:59,466
and we'll have the whole summer.

343
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,335
Fuck the summer,
and fuck Stanley.

344
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,204
Angus.

345
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:04,804
Are you kidding me?

346
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,440
I'm just supposed to stay here?

347
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:11,212
Mom, please don't do this.

348
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:13,080
Please.

349
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:15,115
<i>I suspect that, like me,</i>

350
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:17,784
this is not how you wanted
to spend your holidays,

351
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,321
but such are
the vicissitudes of life.

352
00:20:20,354 --> 00:20:22,356
And as Barton men,

353
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,791
we learn to confront
our challenges

354
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,993
with heads held high
and with a spirit

355
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:28,928
of courage and good fellowship.

356
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:30,897
Uh, in strict accordance
with the dictates

357
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,833
of the manual, of course.

358
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,972
Mr. Tully,
are you joining us as well?

359
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:41,075
What happened to St. Kitts?

360
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:44,777
Something came up.

361
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,389
So, for the next two weeks,

362
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:58,292
we will be following
a standard school schedule...

363
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:00,327
Sir? Uh, sir, we're on vacation.

364
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:02,862
...which means we will be
taking our meals together,

365
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:05,266
and you will observe
regular hours of study.

366
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,867
Study? Are you kidding me?

367
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,570
The Peloponnesian War awaits,
Mr. Kountze.

368
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,238
You and Mr. Tully.

369
00:21:11,272 --> 00:21:13,474
The rest of you can get a jump
on the next semester.

370
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:15,808
It'll pay off. You'll see.

371
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:17,011
We're already holding over,

372
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:18,412
and now we're being
punished for it?

373
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,048
You will be afforded
limited windows for recreation

374
00:21:21,081 --> 00:21:23,384
and supervised
physical activity.

375
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:25,185
The gym's not even open yet.

376
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:27,021
Yeah, they've only lacquered
half the floor.

377
00:21:27,054 --> 00:21:28,555
Fresh air will do you good.

378
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:31,091
It's like 15 degrees outside.

379
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,295
And the Romans bathed naked
in the freezing Tiber.

380
00:21:34,328 --> 00:21:37,097
Adversity builds character,
Mr. Tully.

381
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:39,566
Uh, speaking of which,
the school will be cutting heat

382
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,302
to dormitories
and faculty housing,

383
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:43,604
so we'll all be bunking
in the infirmary.

384
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,006
Oh, God. Geez.

385
00:21:48,075 --> 00:21:50,244
This is the most bullshit ever.

386
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:52,313
If we have to stay,
why'd we have to draw Walleye?

387
00:21:52,346 --> 00:21:54,481
Uh, you know
he used to be a student, right?

388
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:56,116
Yeah, that's why he knows
how to inflict

389
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,152
maximum pain on us,
the sadistic fuck.

390
00:21:58,185 --> 00:22:00,020
At least we didn't draw Decker.

391
00:22:00,054 --> 00:22:02,922
He'd be perving all over us.

392
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:05,326
Hey, guys, hold up for a second.

393
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:08,961
Want one?

394
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,198
No. I got something else.

395
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:15,069
Give me that.

396
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:16,537
Hey, don't smoke that out here.

397
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,138
I don't want to get busted
by Walleye.

398
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:19,606
Don't be such a pussy.

399
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,175
I'm not a pussy.
I just don't want

400
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,111
to end up at Fork Union
paying for your mistake.

401
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:26,647
Teddy Kountze.

402
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,980
Jason Smith.

403
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:29,949
Yeah, I know who you are.

404
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,086
Want to hit this?

405
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,986
Uh, yeah.

406
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,492
You got a great arm, man.

407
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,027
Yeah, well, it's just football.

408
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,495
So, how'd you get stuck
holding over?

409
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:43,896
I'm supposed to be skiing
with my folks up at Haystack,

410
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,232
but my dad put his foot down,

411
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:47,101
said I can't come home
unless I cut my hair.

412
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:49,269
So why don't you
just cut your hair?

413
00:22:49,303 --> 00:22:50,903
Civil disobedience, man.

414
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:52,373
Yeah, right.

415
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:54,641
No, he's cool.
It's just a battle of wills.

416
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:56,510
Still, I was kind of hoping
he'd cave first,

417
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,879
because the powder up at
Haystack is so sweet right now.

418
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:03,250
What about you, Mr. Moto?

419
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:04,284
Why are you here?

420
00:23:04,318 --> 00:23:06,353
Uh, no. Uh, my name is Ye-Joon.

421
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:08,122
Uh, my family is in Korea,

422
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:10,657
and they think it's too far
for me to travel alone.

423
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:14,128
I figured it was because your
rickshaw was broken.

424
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:16,663
Uh, what-what's a rickshaw?

425
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:18,265
You're an asshole, Kountze.

426
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:20,334
Your mind's a cesspool
and a shallow one at that.

427
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:22,069
Who's the asshole, Tully?

428
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:24,138
You're the one
who blew up history.

429
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:25,406
Hey.

430
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:26,640
What's your story, man?

431
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:28,375
Alex Ollerman.

432
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:31,311
I'm here because my parents
are on a mission in Paraguay.

433
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:32,945
We're LDS.

434
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:34,548
Mormons, right?

435
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:37,551
Don't you guys wear some kind
of like magic underwear?

436
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,153
That's a common misconception.

437
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:40,721
Actually, it's called
a temple garment,

438
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:42,656
and we're only supposed
to wear it when we...

439
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,324
Hey, what's up with the townies?

440
00:23:44,358 --> 00:23:46,959
Hey, what are you doing
with our Christmas tree?

441
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:49,363
The school sold it back to us.

442
00:23:49,396 --> 00:23:51,265
Scotch pine, still fresh.

443
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:53,333
Yeah, we're going to
put it back on the lot.

444
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:54,568
We do it every year.

445
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,503
This is the most bullshit ever.

446
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:03,644
Hello, Mary.

447
00:24:03,677 --> 00:24:05,312
Mr. Hunham.

448
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:08,048
I heard you got stuck with
babysitting duty this year.

449
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:10,284
How'd you manage that?

450
00:24:10,317 --> 00:24:11,385
Oh, I don't know.

451
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:14,054
I suppose I failed someone
who richly deserved it.

452
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:16,557
Oh, the Osgood kid?

453
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,525
Yeah, he was a real asshole.

454
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,992
Rich and dumb.

455
00:24:20,027 --> 00:24:21,595
Popular combination around here.

456
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,464
It's a plague.

457
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:24,765
Uh, and you?

458
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:26,467
You'll be here, too?

459
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,368
All by my lonesome.

460
00:24:28,402 --> 00:24:30,537
My little sister Peggy
and her husband invited me

461
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:35,075
to go visit them at Roxbury,
but I feel like it's too soon.

462
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:37,711
Like Curtis will think
that I'm abandoning him.

463
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:40,347
You know, this is the last place

464
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,317
that my baby and I
were together,

465
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,186
-not including the bus station.
-Yeah.

466
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:50,224
Well, I look forward
to your fine cooking.

467
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:51,758
Oh, no, no. Don't do that.

468
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:54,161
All we've got is
whatever is in that walk-in.

469
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:56,363
No new deliveries till January.

470
00:24:56,396 --> 00:24:58,232
Hmm.

471
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:01,568
You mind if I, um...

472
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:05,205
-You want some of that?
-Mm.

473
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:07,708
- All right.
- Thank you.

474
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,612
-You know this is a necessity.
-Oh, yes.

baseless accusation.

Hey, what's your problem, Tully?

You homesick?

486
00:25:46,647 --> 00:25:48,282
Huh? Gonna cry?

487
00:25:48,315 --> 00:25:49,816
Little boy misses his mommy?

Fuck you, Kountze.

Why are you even here, anyway?
Where's your family?

490
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,821
We're renovating our house,
all right?

491
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:56,356
It's all torn up.

492
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,091
They're storing the tools
and stuff in my room.

493
00:25:58,125 --> 00:25:59,192
That's what they told you?

494
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:00,561
It's winter, idiot.

495
00:26:00,594 --> 00:26:02,796
Nobody renovates their house
in the winter.

496
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:04,631
Your parents don't
want you around

497
00:26:04,665 --> 00:26:07,200
because you're a fucking
insecure sociopath.

498
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:08,435
Hey, take it easy, guys.

499
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:09,469
A what?

500
00:26:09,503 --> 00:26:10,737
I mean, who'd want you
for a son?

501
00:26:10,771 --> 00:26:12,406
That's why you grind everybody,

502
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:14,575
because deep down
you know you're an asshole.

503
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:17,611
Plus, academically,
you're a disaster.

504
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:21,448
I mean, if I were your parents,
I'd never want you home again.

505
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:23,850
The only tool in your room
is you.

506
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:32,526
Bitch.

507
00:26:35,295 --> 00:26:36,730
- Come on! Come on!
- Hey, hey, hey!

508
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,198
All right, all right.

509
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:40,601
Break it up. Break it up.
Break it up.

510
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:46,873
They weren't fighting.

511
00:26:46,907 --> 00:26:48,475
I see.

512
00:26:48,508 --> 00:26:51,211
And who started it --
the not fighting?

513
00:26:51,244 --> 00:26:52,613
Hmm? Mr. Tully,

514
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:56,116
perhaps you could shed
some light on the subject.

515
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,151
Mr. Kountze?

516
00:26:58,185 --> 00:26:59,920
Mr. Smith?

517
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:01,888
Mr. Ollerman?

518
00:27:01,922 --> 00:27:04,391
Mr. Park?

519
00:27:04,424 --> 00:27:08,228
All right, then, uh, we'll
do it like the Roman legions.

520
00:27:08,261 --> 00:27:10,564
Absent a confession,
one man's sin

521
00:27:10,597 --> 00:27:12,399
is every man's suffering.

522
00:27:12,432 --> 00:27:15,402
For every minute
the truth is withheld,

523
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:18,238
you will all receive
a detention.

524
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:20,874
And I thought all the Nazis
were hiding in Argentina.

525
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:23,243
Stifle it, Tully.

526
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:28,181
Now, uh, in the first
of said detentions,

527
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:33,320
you will clean the library,
top to bottom.

528
00:27:33,353 --> 00:27:35,355
Scraping the underside
of the desks,

529
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:38,458
which are caked
with snot and gum

530
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:42,496
and all manner of ancient,
unspeakable proteins.

531
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:46,333
Ah, on your hands and knees,
down in the dust,

532
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:50,337
breathing in the dead skin
of generations of students

533
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,640
and desiccated
cockroach assholes.

534
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:54,908
It was Kountze!

535
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:59,312
Kountze started it.

536
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:01,815
Bravo, Mr. Ollerman.

537
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:04,418
Bravo.

538
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:24,838
Lovely.

539
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:26,540
Thank you, Mary.

540
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,749
Didn't we already
have this for lunch?

541
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:37,350
And it was crappy then.

542
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:38,719
Consider yourselves lucky.

543
00:28:38,752 --> 00:28:42,656
During the Third Punic campaign,
149 to 146 BC,

544
00:28:42,689 --> 00:28:44,858
the Romans laid siege
to Carthage

545
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:46,993
for three entire years.

546
00:28:47,028 --> 00:28:48,695
By the time it ended,

547
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:50,964
the Carthaginians
were reduced to eating sand

548
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:52,933
and drinking their own urine.

549
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:55,635
Hence the term "punitive."

550
00:28:57,404 --> 00:28:59,040
Uh... Mary?

551
00:28:59,073 --> 00:29:01,374
Maybe you would, uh...

552
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:03,543
maybe you would care to join us?

553
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:12,619
No, I'm all right. Thank you.

554
00:29:19,726 --> 00:29:22,996
I mean, I know she's sad
about her son and everything,

555
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,565
but still, she's getting paid
to do a job,

556
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,535
and she should do it well,
right?

557
00:29:30,071 --> 00:29:32,372
But I guess, no matter
how bad a cook she is,

558
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:34,041
now they can never fire her.

559
00:29:34,075 --> 00:29:37,277
Will you shut up!

560
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:42,582
You have no idea what
that woman has been thr...

561
00:29:48,522 --> 00:29:50,490
You know, Mr. Kountze,
for most people,

562
00:29:50,524 --> 00:29:52,692
life is like a henhouse ladder.

563
00:29:52,726 --> 00:29:54,394
Shitty and short.

564
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:57,697
You were born lucky.

565
00:29:57,731 --> 00:30:00,000
Maybe someday, you entitled
little degenerates

566
00:30:00,034 --> 00:30:01,535
will appreciate that.

567
00:30:01,568 --> 00:30:04,071
If you don't,
I feel sorry for you

568
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:06,540
and we will have failed
to do our jobs.

569
00:30:06,573 --> 00:30:08,608
Now, eat.

580
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:00,694
Next question
for five points, girls.

581
00:31:00,727 --> 00:31:03,730
What are the dimensions
of the car you drive most?

582
00:31:03,763 --> 00:31:05,732
And that means width by length.

583
00:31:05,765 --> 00:31:07,734
The dimensions of the car
you drive most. Jerry?

584
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:09,769
It's pretty long.

585
00:31:09,803 --> 00:31:12,839
Oh, let's see.
Maybe, uh, 8 by 80?

586
00:31:17,744 --> 00:31:19,180
What's the name
of your car, Union Pacific?

587
00:31:20,647 --> 00:31:23,117
-Oh, good evening.
-Good evening.

588
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,784
What's this?

589
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:26,753
You don't know
<i>The Newlywed Game?</i>

590
00:31:26,786 --> 00:31:29,023
-No. -What planet
have you been living on?

591
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:31,158
I don't really watch television.

592
00:31:31,192 --> 00:31:33,194
It's a show where
they ask couples questions

593
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:35,428
to see how well
they know each other.

594
00:31:35,462 --> 00:31:37,064
That sounds like
courting disaster.

595
00:31:37,098 --> 00:31:40,067
Yeah, that's
the whole damn point.

596
00:31:40,101 --> 00:31:41,902
Sit down.

597
00:31:41,935 --> 00:31:43,204
Come on.

598
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:45,639
Broaden your horizons.

599
00:31:47,874 --> 00:31:51,212
This is a rerun from July.

600
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:53,780
Which is why they're playing
for Weber barbecues

601
00:31:53,813 --> 00:31:55,182
and picnic utensils.

602
00:31:55,216 --> 00:31:57,517
- Fascinating.
- Mm-hmm.

603
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,952
If we ever take
separate vacations,

604
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:00,453
I am sending my wife to blank...

605
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:03,057
-Oh. Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

606
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:10,931
So, how are the boys?

607
00:32:10,964 --> 00:32:13,700
Broken in body and spirit.

608
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:18,239
Okay, well, it is the holidays,
so, you know, go easy on them.

609
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:19,773
Oh, please.

610
00:32:19,806 --> 00:32:22,176
They've had it easy
their whole lives.

611
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:24,078
You don't know that.

612
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:25,313
Did you?

613
00:32:26,846 --> 00:32:29,649
Besides, everybody should be
with their people on Christmas.

614
00:32:29,683 --> 00:32:31,252
- Hawaii, probably.
- Hawaii. All right.

615
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:32,686
He says he's gonna send you
to Santa Ana

616
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:34,621
and he's going to Las Vegas.

617
00:32:34,654 --> 00:32:36,090
Nobody can watch you
in Siberia.

618
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:37,958
Where are you going?

619
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:40,027
-To Vegas.
-Las Vegas?

620
00:32:40,061 --> 00:32:42,662
Yeah.

621
00:32:42,696 --> 00:32:44,664
No.

622
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:47,068
Those two are going to get
a divorce.

623
00:32:47,101 --> 00:32:48,635
How do you know?

624
00:32:48,668 --> 00:32:50,704
I recognize that look
of stale disappointment.

625
00:32:50,737 --> 00:32:52,906
She hates him.

626
00:32:52,939 --> 00:32:54,975
Oh.

627
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:56,810
How long were you married?

628
00:32:56,843 --> 00:32:58,778
I was engaged
to Curtis's father.

629
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:02,049
-Mm. -But he died
before I gave birth.

630
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:03,950
Harold.

631
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:06,253
He worked in the shipyard.

632
00:33:06,287 --> 00:33:08,788
And one day, they was
carrying this big, uh,

633
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:12,226
cargo pallet,
and the cable snapped.

634
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,527
Hit him right across the head.

635
00:33:16,629 --> 00:33:18,265
They were good men.

636
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:19,766
Both of them.

637
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:23,137
And neither of them
made it to 25.

638
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,905
My baby wasn't even 20.

639
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:29,276
I'm so sorry.

640
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:32,246
I took this job
when Curtis was small

641
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,947
because I wanted to ensure

642
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,949
that he was going to have
a good education.

643
00:33:35,982 --> 00:33:38,685
-You know he flourished here.
-Yes. No, he was a great kid.

644
00:33:38,718 --> 00:33:40,121
-I had him one semester.
-Mm-hmm.

645
00:33:40,154 --> 00:33:41,688
Very insightful.

646
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:43,923
Mm-hmm. He hated you.

647
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:47,761
He said you were a real asshole.

648
00:33:48,628 --> 00:33:51,564
Well, uh, like I said...

649
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:53,833
sharp kid. Insightful.

650
00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:59,773
He had his heart set
on Swarthmore.

651
00:33:59,806 --> 00:34:02,709
And he had the grades,
but I didn't have the money.

652
00:34:02,742 --> 00:34:05,779
Even with financial aid,
it wasn't enough.

653
00:34:05,812 --> 00:34:10,051
So, when he got called up
and no student deferment,

654
00:34:10,084 --> 00:34:11,985
off he went.

655
00:34:12,852 --> 00:34:14,821
Do you know what he said to me?

656
00:34:14,854 --> 00:34:18,792
He said,
"Hey, Ma, look at the upside.

657
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:23,830
When I get discharged, I can go
to college on the GI Bill."

658
00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:27,801
College.

659
00:34:33,706 --> 00:34:35,909
And here we are.

660
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:40,647
With my Curtis
in the cold ground

661
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,184
and those boys
safe and warm in their beds.

662
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,686
It's like you said.

663
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,222
How'd you say it?

664
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:50,224
"Life is like
a henhouse ladder."

665
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:51,925
That's right.

666
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:54,295
I can hear everything
you're saying from the kitchen.

667
00:34:54,328 --> 00:34:56,097
Especially that Kountze kid.

668
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,765
Crown prince of all
the little assholes.

669
00:34:58,798 --> 00:35:00,367
It's zero.

670
00:35:00,401 --> 00:35:01,868
Zero. She said it is zero!

671
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:03,770
Couple number one,
Mike and Sherry McCray,

672
00:35:03,803 --> 00:35:05,839

673

All right, you fetid layabouts.

It's daylight in the swamp!

675
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:22,223
Arise!

676
00:35:26,993 --> 00:35:28,395
Speed, gentlemen.

677
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:30,264
Speed!

678
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:34,268
Without sufficient exercise,
the body devours itself.

679
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:35,969
That's it!

680
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:37,904

We can take it, go somewhere.
Boston, maybe?

689
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:12,106
Nah, we'd get in
so much trouble.

690
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:14,175
Face it. We're stuck.

691
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,477
If we just had some way
to get out of here.

692
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:19,013
-Yo.
-Just split.

693
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:21,881
Well, you could put a chopper
down right in the quad.

694
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:22,815
What?

695
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,717
A helicopter, dumbass.

696
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:26,786
His old man's the CEO
of Pratt & Whitney.

697
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:28,189
Yeah, he's got his own bird.

698
00:36:28,222 --> 00:36:30,057
He takes it from Stamford
to the city every morning.

699
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,425
Lands it right in the backyard.

700
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:33,294
The pilot's name is Wild Bill.

701
00:36:33,327 --> 00:36:36,330
-Wild Bill?
-Yeah.

702
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:38,399
He flew up to Haystack with it.

703
00:36:38,432 --> 00:36:41,035
Took the presents
and everything, minus me.

704
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:43,970
Flying with presents,
like Santa Claus.

705
00:36:44,004 --> 00:36:45,072
Yeah.

706
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:47,141
Just like Santa Claus.

707
00:36:47,174 --> 00:36:48,942
Hey.

708
00:36:48,975 --> 00:36:50,843
Oh, let's go, let's go!

709
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:54,481
You know, if I were back home
right now in Provo,

710
00:36:54,515 --> 00:36:57,917
it'd be really warm inside.

711
00:36:57,951 --> 00:37:01,422
And my mom, she'd be making me
baked apples,

712
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:05,326
and the whole house would smell
like cinnamon and brown sugar.

713
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,294
That sounds so nice.

714
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:10,130
Touchdown!

715
00:37:12,366 --> 00:37:13,833
Hey!

716
00:37:13,866 --> 00:37:15,102
That's what you get

717
00:37:15,135 --> 00:37:17,004
for ratting me out,
you little Mormon!

718
00:37:17,037 --> 00:37:19,839
What?

719
00:37:19,872 --> 00:37:21,108
Let's go!

720
00:37:21,141 --> 00:37:22,976
What's Fork Union?

721
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:27,381
Uh, before, you said you don't
want to end up at Fork Union.

722
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:30,517
It's a military academy
in Virginia.

723
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:33,520
That's where I'm going if I get
kicked out of school again.

724
00:37:33,554 --> 00:37:36,990
How many schools
have you been kicked out of?

725
00:37:37,024 --> 00:37:38,425
Three.

726
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:40,194
That's why I'm still a junior.

727
00:37:40,227 --> 00:37:42,895
- Give or take a semester.
- It's gone!

728
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,065
My glove's gone.

729
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:48,102
Twisted fucker orphaned
that glove on purpose.

730
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:51,871
Left you with one so the loss
would sting that much more.

731
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:02,409
Hey.

732
00:39:03,544 --> 00:39:05,945
You all right?

733
00:39:05,978 --> 00:39:07,880
I had a nightmare.

734
00:39:07,914 --> 00:39:09,982
I get nightmares too.

735
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:12,419
I'm always falling or drowning.

736
00:39:12,453 --> 00:39:14,421
Also...

737
00:39:16,457 --> 00:39:18,392
I had an accident.

738
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:26,367
Yeah, you did.

739
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,069
Shh. Stop crying.

740
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:31,438
If they hear you,
they'll crucify you.

741
00:39:31,472 --> 00:39:34,274
Which would be ironic
since you're Buddhist.

742
00:39:34,308 --> 00:39:37,010
I know this is
an excellent school,

743
00:39:37,044 --> 00:39:39,513
and my brothers went here,

744
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:42,015
but I miss my family,

745
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:44,351
and I have no friends.

746
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:48,856
Yeah, well,
friends are overrated.

747
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,426
I'll help you hide the sheets
in the morning, all right?

748
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:56,463
In the meantime, find a dry spot
and try to get some sleep.

749
00:39:56,497 --> 00:39:58,365
Thank you.

750
00:40:03,604 --> 00:40:05,905
Fucking asparagus.

751
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:34,568
Are you kidding me?

752
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:37,471
It's only 11:00,
and he's already lit.

753
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:39,206
I can smell the whiskey on him.

754
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:41,974
Can you blame him?
It's freezing in here.

755
00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:44,278
It's fucking Greenland in here.

756
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,695
What the hell is that?

757
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,188
I knew it!

758
00:41:28,222 --> 00:41:31,024
He finally caved,
the big softie.

759
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:35,062
Hey, any of you guys
like to ski?

760
00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:41,502
Thank you.

761
00:41:41,535 --> 00:41:43,504
Goodbye, now.

762
00:41:50,277 --> 00:41:52,045
Yes!

763
00:41:58,185 --> 00:41:59,653
Well, good news, gentlemen.

764
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:02,556
I was able to reach Dr. Woodrup
and your parents.

765
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:05,158
Uh, most of them, anyway.

766
00:42:06,226 --> 00:42:08,595
Try calling again.
Just one more time, please.

767
00:42:08,629 --> 00:42:10,130
There's no point.

768
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:11,798
The front desk says
they're not answering.

769
00:42:11,832 --> 00:42:14,067
He says they're away
on some excursion.

770
00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:16,136
Excursion.

771
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:18,539
I'm as disappointed as you are,
if not more so.

772
00:42:18,572 --> 00:42:20,741
I could have been spending
the rest of my vacation

773
00:42:20,774 --> 00:42:22,809
reading mystery novels.

774
00:42:22,843 --> 00:42:25,646
Maybe they're back now.
Just call again, please.

775
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,448
Okay.

776
00:42:33,854 --> 00:42:35,622
Happy holidays.

777
00:42:35,656 --> 00:42:38,058
Same to you.

778
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,462
Take care, Tully.

779
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,099
I guess that just
leaves you, huh?

780
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:48,435
Be sure to do all your homework.

781
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,338
Oh, almost forgot.

782
00:42:51,371 --> 00:42:53,640
I found that picture
you were looking for.

783
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:57,144
Merry Christmas, Mr. Tully.

784
00:43:03,817 --> 00:43:05,619
Bye, Angus.

785
00:43:38,852 --> 00:43:42,122
Well, let's make the best
of it, shall we?

786
00:43:45,392 --> 00:43:47,694
Oh, I suppose, um,

787
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:49,663
- Stan Laurel, maybe, because...
- Stan Laurel.

788
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:51,898
All right. Your husband said
his favorite silent movie star

789
00:43:51,932 --> 00:43:54,801
is Rudolph Valentino.

790
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:57,270
- Oh. He is good.
- Well, yeah.

791
00:44:00,273 --> 00:44:01,775
The last of our
five-point questions, girls...

792
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:04,177
How about you?
You ever been married?

793
00:44:07,414 --> 00:44:09,783
No. I did get close once.

794
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:11,885
Right after college.

795
00:44:11,918 --> 00:44:13,520
And?

796
00:44:13,553 --> 00:44:15,489
We came to our senses.

797
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:20,460
This is not exactly a face
forged for romance, Mary.

798
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:22,896
Yeah, and the...

799
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:24,798
And, you know...

800
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:26,299
What?

801
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,835
Nothing.

802
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:31,672
I don't know.
I like being alone.

803
00:44:31,705 --> 00:44:35,542
I've always found myself drawn
to the aesthetic.

804
00:44:35,575 --> 00:44:37,277
Like a monk.

805
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,479
The forgoing
of sensual pleasures

806
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:41,415
for the achievement
of spiritual goals.

807
00:44:41,448 --> 00:44:42,916
-Spiritual goals?
-Mm-hmm.

808
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:44,484
You?

809
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:45,952
What spiritual goals
are we talking about?

810
00:44:45,986 --> 00:44:47,387
You go to church?

811
00:44:47,421 --> 00:44:49,356
-Mm, only when required.
-Exactly.

812
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:51,558
When's the last time
you even left campus?

813
00:44:51,591 --> 00:44:53,560
-I go into town all the time.
-Oh.

814
00:44:53,593 --> 00:44:55,696
For groceries
and various errands

815
00:44:55,729 --> 00:44:57,264
-and appointments.
-Mm-hmm.

816
00:44:59,466 --> 00:45:02,335
Okay, yes,
I don't leave campus often.

817
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:03,837
I don't really feel the need.

818
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,572
Let me ask you something.

819
00:45:05,605 --> 00:45:08,942
If you could go anywhere
on Earth, where would you go?

820
00:45:08,975 --> 00:45:10,677
Oh.

821
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:12,846
Greece, Italy,

822
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:15,849
Egypt, Peru, Carthage.

823
00:45:15,882 --> 00:45:17,751
Tunisia now, of course.

824
00:45:17,784 --> 00:45:20,487
In college, I started
a monograph on Carthage.

825
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,423
I'd like to finish that someday.

826
00:45:23,457 --> 00:45:26,960
A monograph is
like a book, o-only shorter.

827
00:45:26,993 --> 00:45:29,262
I know what a monograph is.

828
00:45:29,296 --> 00:45:31,498
Why not just write a book?

829
00:45:32,766 --> 00:45:35,769
I'm not sure I have
an entire book in me.

830
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:40,540
You can't even dream
a whole dream, can you?

831
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,932
Monet, Manet, Picasso.

832
00:46:42,702 --> 00:46:45,405

833
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:52,312

I have a surprise.

843
00:48:24,138 --> 00:48:26,740
Uh, these were a gift to me,

844
00:48:26,773 --> 00:48:30,011
and I would like to share them
with both of you.

845
00:48:30,944 --> 00:48:33,580
Look at them.
Look at all the festive shapes.

846
00:48:33,613 --> 00:48:36,917
Snowflakes and gingerbread men.
A tree.

847
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,486
A little mitten.

848
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:41,821
Mmm.

849
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,758
Mmm.

850
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:47,794
May I go to the bathroom, sir?

851
00:48:47,827 --> 00:48:49,696
You may.

852
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:56,469
Well, I'm trying.

853
00:49:01,075 --> 00:49:02,575
Mmm.

854
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:03,910
If you don't have a single room,

855
00:49:03,944 --> 00:49:05,879
uh, I'll take a junior suite
or the equivalent.

856
00:49:05,912 --> 00:49:07,948
I fully understand
it's the holidays,

857
00:49:07,981 --> 00:49:09,549
but it's kind of an emergency.

858
00:49:09,582 --> 00:49:11,484
Mm-hmm. Yeah, sure.

859
00:49:11,518 --> 00:49:12,986
Mr. Tully, what are you doing?

860
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,221
Uh, no, no credit card.

861
00:49:14,255 --> 00:49:15,622
I'll pay cash
or traveler's checks.

862
00:49:15,655 --> 00:49:17,058
I didn't say
you could use the phone.

863
00:49:17,091 --> 00:49:18,558
Okay, I see.

864
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,559
Is there anywhere else
you could recommend?

865
00:49:19,592 --> 00:49:20,961
Maybe downtown or...

866
00:49:20,994 --> 00:49:22,996
-Was that a hotel?
-None of your business.

867
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:26,200
It is absolutely my business.
I'm looking after you.

868
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:28,102
Looking after me? Really?

869
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:30,137
Like what? Like my warden?

870
00:49:30,171 --> 00:49:31,705
Like my butler?

871
00:49:31,738 --> 00:49:33,640
There's nobody here, okay?

872
00:49:33,673 --> 00:49:35,575
Just us two losers
and a grieving mom.

873
00:49:35,608 --> 00:49:37,011
So let's cut the shit.

874
00:49:37,044 --> 00:49:39,213
You stay out of my way,
and I'll stay out of yours.

875
00:49:39,246 --> 00:49:40,981
That's a detention.

876
00:49:41,015 --> 00:49:42,916
You just earned yourself
a detention, sir.

877
00:49:42,949 --> 00:49:44,617
Now, get back here!

878
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:47,587
Being here with you is already
one big fucking detention!

879
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,923
Son of a bitch,
that's another detention!

880
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:53,493
Mr. Tully!

881
00:49:54,928 --> 00:49:57,530
I don't know what you're
playing at, Mr. Tully,

882
00:49:57,564 --> 00:49:59,833
but you are courting disaster!

883
00:49:59,866 --> 00:50:02,569
Without exercise,
the body devours itself.

884
00:50:02,602 --> 00:50:05,239
You are careening
towards suspension!

885
00:50:31,965 --> 00:50:34,301
Don't even think about it,
Mr. Tully.

886
00:50:34,335 --> 00:50:38,339
You are a hair's breadth
from suspension.

887
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:41,275
I'll wash my hands of you,
you hear me?

888
00:50:41,308 --> 00:50:43,676
Wash my hands.

889
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:47,847
Stop right there.

890
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:51,551
You know the gym is
strictly off-limits.

891
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:54,587
This is your Rubicon.

892
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:57,957
Do not cross the Rubicon.

893
00:51:01,661 --> 00:51:03,997
<i>Alea jacta est.</i>

894
00:51:17,344 --> 00:51:19,813
Oh, fuck! Ow!

895
00:51:19,846 --> 00:51:22,715
Jesus, Mr. Hunham! Fuck!

896
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,152
Hurry up! Hurry!

897
00:51:25,186 --> 00:51:27,188
I am hurrying!

898
00:51:27,221 --> 00:51:28,822
I was on thin ice already.

899
00:51:28,855 --> 00:51:30,957
If Woodrup finds out,
the facts won't matter.

900
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:32,959
-He'll make it my fault.
-It is your fault!

901
00:51:32,992 --> 00:51:35,096
You were supposed to be
looking after me.

902
00:51:35,129 --> 00:51:36,696
I told you to stop.

903
00:51:36,729 --> 00:51:38,365
You said you washed
your hands of me.

904
00:51:38,399 --> 00:51:39,866
No, I meant it metaphorically!

905
00:51:39,899 --> 00:51:41,835
Of course you meant it
metaphorically.

906
00:51:41,868 --> 00:51:45,072
What were you going to do,
actually go and wash your hands?

907
00:51:45,106 --> 00:51:46,806
This is the end.

908
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,243
They'll inform the school
who will inform your parents,

909
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:50,977
and then it's curtains.

910
00:51:52,446 --> 00:51:55,116
You're gonna get me fired.

911
00:51:55,149 --> 00:51:57,384
You.

912
00:51:57,418 --> 00:51:58,985
I'm the one
that might lose an arm,

913
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:01,355
and all you can think about
is yourself.

914
00:52:01,388 --> 00:52:03,124
If you could
fill this out, please.

915
00:52:03,157 --> 00:52:04,991
Admissions and insurance.

916
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,764
Excuse me.

917
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:17,204
Is there any way we could skip
this whole insurance thing?

918
00:52:17,238 --> 00:52:18,872
It's just standard procedure.

919
00:52:18,905 --> 00:52:20,707
I understand, but look, um,

920
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,876
we were over at Squantz Pond
playing hockey,

921
00:52:22,909 --> 00:52:24,345
and I slipped on the ice.

922
00:52:24,378 --> 00:52:25,945
Angus, what are you doing?

923
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:29,083
My mom told him not to take me,
but I made him.

924
00:52:29,116 --> 00:52:30,417
My folks are divorced.

925
00:52:30,451 --> 00:52:32,086
We don't get to see each other
very often.

926
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:34,421
She'll be mad as a hornet
if she finds out.

927
00:52:34,455 --> 00:52:35,922
Okay, that's your business,

928
00:52:35,955 --> 00:52:37,757
but we just have
certain protocols.

929
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:39,360
-Yeah. Protocols.
-Please.

930
00:52:39,393 --> 00:52:41,328
I never get to see my dad.

931
00:52:41,362 --> 00:52:43,830
It was my fault. All mine.

932
00:52:43,863 --> 00:52:46,167
I don't want to get him
in any trouble.

933
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,203
I don't want her dragging you
into court again.

934
00:52:49,236 --> 00:52:51,405
We can skip the insurance thing.

935
00:52:51,438 --> 00:52:53,973
We can pay cash.

936
00:52:54,008 --> 00:52:56,010
Right, Dad?

937
00:52:56,043 --> 00:52:58,212
So the good news is
nothing's broken,

938
00:52:58,245 --> 00:53:01,182
but you did dislocate
your shoulder pretty badly.

939
00:53:01,215 --> 00:53:02,916
What does that mean?

940
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:05,985
Well, that means that your arm
has popped out of the socket.

941
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,855
And we just need
to pop it back in.

942
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,692
I'm going to have you lie down.

943
00:53:13,893 --> 00:53:15,862
-Nice and easy.
-Is this going to hurt?

944
00:53:15,895 --> 00:53:18,165
Any more than it does now?

945
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:20,034
Not if you relax.

946
00:53:20,067 --> 00:53:23,970
The key is just to relax
as best as you can.

947
00:53:26,106 --> 00:53:28,975
Deep breaths. Deep breaths.

948
00:53:32,845 --> 00:53:34,448
On the count of three.

949
00:53:34,481 --> 00:53:37,784
One, two, three.

950
00:53:42,855 --> 00:53:44,525
Jesus!

951
00:53:49,263 --> 00:53:50,964
Barton men don't do that.

952
00:53:50,997 --> 00:53:52,132
Do what?

953
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:53,766
Barton men don't lie.

954
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,835
Yeah, well, I had momentum.

955
00:53:55,868 --> 00:53:57,937
Mm-hmm.

956
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:03,310
Hello.

957
00:54:03,344 --> 00:54:05,745
We have this prescription.

958
00:54:06,879 --> 00:54:08,382
Percodan. Okay.

959
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:10,117
Uh, give me a couple minutes.

960
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:12,019
Thank you.

961
00:54:13,087 --> 00:54:15,256
Look, you said, if Woodrup
finds out, you're screwed,

962
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:16,490
so now he won't find out.

963
00:54:16,523 --> 00:54:18,359
What happens
if your parents inquire?

964
00:54:18,392 --> 00:54:20,127
Never gonna happen.

965
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,328
Trust me.

966
00:54:22,895 --> 00:54:26,400
Okay, then.
This all remains entre nous.

967
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:28,402
Got it? You know
what entre nous means?

968
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:30,437
<i>Oui, monsieur.</i>

969
00:54:30,471 --> 00:54:32,106
Now you owe me.

970
00:54:32,139 --> 00:54:33,873
Owe you?

971
00:54:33,906 --> 00:54:36,043
Oh, do not try to leverage me,
Mr. Tully.

972
00:54:36,076 --> 00:54:38,512
All I'm looking for
is a little thank-you

973
00:54:38,545 --> 00:54:41,048
that I did something nice
for you.

974
00:54:42,082 --> 00:54:43,584
That's all.

975
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,589
<i>Think I'll start</i>
<i>with a beer. How about you?</i>

976
00:54:48,622 --> 00:54:51,292
Don't be ridiculous, Mr. Tully.

977
00:54:51,325 --> 00:54:53,160
Get your cheeseburger.

978
00:54:53,193 --> 00:54:55,362
-They've got Miller High Life.
-Mm.

979
00:54:55,396 --> 00:54:57,864
-The champagne of beers.
-Oh.

980
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,303
Okay, you ready to order? Oh!

981
00:55:02,336 --> 00:55:04,305
Miss Crane.

982
00:55:04,338 --> 00:55:05,472
As I live and breathe.

983
00:55:05,506 --> 00:55:07,441
What-what...
what are you doing here?

984
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:09,009
Oh. Hi, guys.

985
00:55:09,043 --> 00:55:10,943
Yeah, I always pick up
a little extra work

986
00:55:10,977 --> 00:55:12,513
over Thanksgiving and Christmas.

987
00:55:12,546 --> 00:55:14,415
Ah.

988
00:55:14,448 --> 00:55:17,084
Well, um, this is Mr. Tully.

989
00:55:17,117 --> 00:55:19,286
Oh, sure. I know you.

990
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,487
Angus Tully.

991
00:55:20,521 --> 00:55:22,056
We met outside
Dr. Woodrup's office.

992
00:55:22,089 --> 00:55:24,091
I was wrongly accused
of blowing up a toilet.

993
00:55:24,124 --> 00:55:26,560
I didn't know about
the wrongly part.

994
00:55:27,994 --> 00:55:29,630
Um, he'll have a cheeseburger.

995
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:30,897
Okay.

996
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:32,066
And a Miller High Life, please.

997
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:34,068
Uh, no, you will not.

998
00:55:34,101 --> 00:55:36,136
Where do you stand on
Miller High Life, Miss Crane?

999
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:40,040
Well, like they say,
it's the champagne of beers.

1000
00:55:40,074 --> 00:55:41,941
- And she's a professional.
- Okay.

1001
00:55:41,974 --> 00:55:44,378
Okay, one cheeseburger.

1002
00:55:45,612 --> 00:55:47,214
- And a Coke.
- Okay.

1003
00:55:47,247 --> 00:55:49,016
I will have a cheeseburger
as well.

1004
00:55:49,049 --> 00:55:50,351
Two cheeseburgers.

1005
00:55:50,384 --> 00:55:53,986
-And a Jim Beam on the rocks.
-Oh. Okay.

1006
00:55:54,021 --> 00:55:55,356
Please.

1007
00:55:55,389 --> 00:55:58,225
Okay. You got it, guys.

1008
00:55:58,258 --> 00:56:00,494
Thank you.

1009
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:02,262
Hmm.

1010
00:56:03,163 --> 00:56:05,599
Ouch. You two have chemistry.

1011
00:56:05,632 --> 00:56:07,468
Okay.

1012
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:09,169
That's the Percodan talking.

1013
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:10,604
I don't know,
seeing her like this,

1014
00:56:10,637 --> 00:56:12,039
I think she's pretty attractive.

1015
00:56:12,072 --> 00:56:14,608
Listen, you hormonal vulgarian,

1016
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:17,111
that woman deserves
your respect,

1017
00:56:17,144 --> 00:56:20,647
not your erotic speculation.

1018
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:22,583
Well, may I at least
go to the bathroom?

1019
00:56:22,616 --> 00:56:25,419
Sir?

1020
00:56:25,452 --> 00:56:27,287
You mean the pay phone?

1021
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:36,430
-Okay.
-Ah.

1022
00:56:36,463 --> 00:56:37,964
A Coke...

1023
00:56:37,997 --> 00:56:39,299
-and a double Jim.
-Oh.

1024
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:40,967
I charged you for a single.

1025
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,136
Thank you.

1026
00:56:42,169 --> 00:56:44,171
-Chin-chin.
-Mm-hmm.

1027
00:56:44,204 --> 00:56:47,141
So, how'd you get stuck
holding over?

1028
00:56:47,174 --> 00:56:48,709
I thought it was
Mr. Endicott's year.

1029
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:50,677
No, I know.

1030
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:53,013
Uh, I'm being punished.

1031
00:56:53,046 --> 00:56:55,015
Yeah, Dr. Woodrup is, um...

1032
00:56:55,048 --> 00:56:57,284
A pompous ass
with a dictator complex?

1033
00:56:59,353 --> 00:57:00,953
Oops. Um...

1034
00:57:00,987 --> 00:57:03,424
Uh, what I meant to say was, uh,

1035
00:57:03,457 --> 00:57:06,193
well, he's a lovely
compassionate educator

1036
00:57:06,226 --> 00:57:08,429
with a really groovy beard.

1037
00:57:08,462 --> 00:57:11,298
Yeah. You know, I've had
a lot of former students

1038
00:57:11,331 --> 00:57:13,167
ascend to positions
of authority.

1039
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,669
He's the only one
I've ever had to report to.

1040
00:57:15,702 --> 00:57:17,538
-He was your student?
-Oh, yes.

1041
00:57:17,571 --> 00:57:19,173
My first year teaching,

1042
00:57:19,206 --> 00:57:21,408
and he was an asshole even then.

1043
00:57:23,477 --> 00:57:25,212
Oh.

1044
00:57:25,245 --> 00:57:28,115
Well, listen, if you and Angus
are really all alone up there,

1045
00:57:28,148 --> 00:57:30,184
I'm having a little
Christmas Eve party.

1046
00:57:30,217 --> 00:57:33,320
In case, you know,
you guys want to stop by.

Sorry, kid. Next game's taken.

1053
00:58:02,049 --> 00:58:03,350
But I just put a dime down.

1054
00:58:03,383 --> 00:58:05,719
I don't care.
My buddy's up next.

1055
00:58:05,752 --> 00:58:07,154
That's not how it works.

1056
00:58:07,187 --> 00:58:09,089
That's how it works in here.

1057
00:58:09,122 --> 00:58:11,124
Why don't you go shoot
the other fucking machine?

1058
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:13,293
Because I don't want to shoot
the other fucking machine.

1059
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:16,230
-I want to use this one.
-Fuck!

1060
00:58:16,263 --> 00:58:19,032
Thanks for fucking up my mojo.

1061
00:58:19,066 --> 00:58:21,101
Hey, Kenny, you're up.

1062
00:58:21,134 --> 00:58:22,269
Bullshit.

1063
00:58:22,302 --> 00:58:24,404
I put my dime down. I'm up next.

1064
00:58:24,438 --> 00:58:26,306
What was that?

1065
00:58:29,576 --> 00:58:31,378
Oh.

1066
00:58:35,582 --> 00:58:38,185
Hey, sport, my eyes are up here.

1067
00:58:38,218 --> 00:58:40,087
Look at this fucking kid.

1068
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,189
Spoiled little fucking
Barton boy.

1069
00:58:42,222 --> 00:58:44,525
Yeah, he's a fancy
little prick, isn't he?

1070
00:58:44,558 --> 00:58:46,126
You know what?

1071
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:47,661
You can just take my dime.

1072
00:58:47,694 --> 00:58:49,196
You want me to take your dime?

1073
00:58:49,229 --> 00:58:51,665
Like it's, uh...
like it's charity?

1074
00:58:51,698 --> 00:58:53,667
No. What I meant was...

1075
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,602
we could play together.

1076
00:58:55,636 --> 00:58:57,538
Yeah, you could be my left arm.

1077
00:58:57,571 --> 00:59:00,107
The fuck did you just say to me?

1078
00:59:00,707 --> 00:59:02,809
-Hey!
-Mr. Hunham?

1079
00:59:02,843 --> 00:59:04,278
Mm, yes?

1080
00:59:04,311 --> 00:59:06,179
-Mr. Hunham, can we go, please?
-Why?

1081
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:07,681
Uh, I've just been called
a fancy little prick.

1082
00:59:07,714 --> 00:59:09,683
-Hey! Why'd you run off?
-We should go.

1083
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:11,218
We were just talking to you.

1084
00:59:11,251 --> 00:59:12,553
Don't they teach you manners
at that school?

1085
00:59:12,586 --> 00:59:13,687
- No, no, no. No, no.
- Kenneth!

1086
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:14,821
Kenneth, leave him alone.

1087
00:59:14,855 --> 00:59:16,857
They just came in for some food.

1088
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:18,625
Kenneth. Kenneth.

1089
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:20,127
Is that right?

1090
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,429
Uh, I don't doubt he did
something to offend you.

1091
00:59:22,462 --> 00:59:23,730
It's his specialty.

1092
00:59:23,764 --> 00:59:26,533
Now, perhaps I can purchase you
gentlemen something to imbibe

1093
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:30,237
and we could let whatever
this unfortunate incident is

1094
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,406
go the way of the dodo.

1095
00:59:32,439 --> 00:59:33,840
The what?

1096
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:35,876
The dodo. It's an extinct bird.

1097
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:37,444
What he's trying to say is

1098
00:59:37,477 --> 00:59:40,280
he'd like to buy you guys
a beer.

1099
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:45,819
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.
- Great.

1100
00:59:45,852 --> 00:59:47,854
Yeah, yeah. I'll have a Miller.

1101
00:59:47,888 --> 00:59:50,591
Champagne of beers.

1102
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:55,329
Why'd you buy those guys beers?
They're assholes.

1103
00:59:55,362 --> 00:59:57,631
That's one way to look at it.

1104
00:59:58,632 --> 01:00:00,534
Hey.

1105
01:00:00,567 --> 01:00:02,369
Catch.

1106
01:00:02,402 --> 01:00:05,606
How many boys do you know
have had their hands blown off?

1107
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,610
Barton boys don't go to Vietnam.

1108
01:00:09,643 --> 01:00:13,680
No, they go to Yale
or Dartmouth or Cornell,

1109
01:00:13,714 --> 01:00:16,383
whether they deserve to or not.

1110
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:20,454
-Except for Curtis Lamb.
-Except for Curtis Lamb.

1111
01:00:26,693 --> 01:00:29,162
Were you ever in the military?

1112
01:00:29,196 --> 01:00:32,366
Yes. I tried to enlist in '41,
but was rejected.

1113
01:00:32,399 --> 01:00:34,868
I have to get in over there.

1114
01:00:34,901 --> 01:00:37,471
They made me an air raid warden.

1115
01:00:37,504 --> 01:00:39,806
Gave me a whistle
and everything.

1116
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,776
Helmet, armband.

1117
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:45,379
Yeah.

1118
01:00:45,412 --> 01:00:47,848
Before we get going,
can I be candid with you?

1119
01:00:47,881 --> 01:00:50,183
Mm-hmm.

1120
01:00:50,217 --> 01:00:52,152
You smell.

1121
01:00:56,456 --> 01:00:57,591
Like fish.

1122
01:00:57,624 --> 01:00:59,860
And it's really noticeable
towards the end of the day.

1123
01:00:59,893 --> 01:01:01,928
I can even smell it
on your coat.

1124
01:01:01,962 --> 01:01:04,698
Mind if I crack the window?

1125
01:01:06,867 --> 01:01:08,802
Trimethylaminuria.

1126
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:09,936
Huh?

1127
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:12,706
Trimethylaminuria.

1128
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:15,742
Means my body can't break down
trimethylamine.

1129
01:01:15,776 --> 01:01:17,377
That's the smell.

1130
01:01:17,411 --> 01:01:20,947
And, uh, yes,
more toward the end of the day.

1131
01:01:20,981 --> 01:01:22,416
Wow.

1132
01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:25,485
-Your whole life?
-Mm-hmm.

1133
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:27,320
No wonder you're afraid
of women.

1134
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:30,223
I am not afraid of women.

1135
01:01:30,257 --> 01:01:31,425
-Jesus H. Christ.
-Sorry.

1136
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:32,759
I shouldn't have said anything.

1137
01:01:33,994 --> 01:01:35,429
Dr. Gertler says I don't always

1138
01:01:35,462 --> 01:01:36,997
give consideration
to my audience.

1139
01:01:37,031 --> 01:01:40,200
Ah. And who is Dr. Gertler?

1140
01:01:40,867 --> 01:01:42,636
-My shrink.
-Hmm.

1141
01:01:42,669 --> 01:01:45,972
Has Dr. Gertler ever tried
a good, swift kick in the ass?

1142
01:01:47,774 --> 01:01:49,910
Okay, all right, now your turn.

1143
01:01:49,943 --> 01:01:51,311
-Hmm.
-Go ahead.

1144
01:01:51,344 --> 01:01:52,713
Tell me something about me.

1145
01:01:52,746 --> 01:01:54,614
-Something negative.
-Something negative about you?

1146
01:01:54,648 --> 01:01:56,616
Sure. Just one thing.

1147
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:58,985
Just one?

1148
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:00,987
<i>Why'd you two</i>
<i>miss dinner last night?</i>

1149
01:02:01,022 --> 01:02:05,826
Oh, we went into town on some,
uh, school-related business.

1150
01:02:05,859 --> 01:02:07,761
And you couldn't call?

1151
01:02:07,794 --> 01:02:09,429
Sorry.

1152
01:02:11,032 --> 01:02:12,766
Good morning, everybody.

1153
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:14,434
-Hi, Danny.
-Good morning.

1154
01:02:14,468 --> 01:02:16,503
You can go on in
and fix yourself a plate.

1155
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:18,872
Mm, I just saw something funny.

1156
01:02:18,905 --> 01:02:21,042
I walked into the gym,

1157
01:02:21,075 --> 01:02:24,377
and someone had vomited
in there.

1158
01:02:27,481 --> 01:02:29,816
You don't say. I don't know
anything about that.

1159
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:31,351
Yeah. Me, neither.

1160
01:02:31,384 --> 01:02:33,487
No, uh, I'll look into that
right away.

1161
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,755
Thank you.

1162
01:02:34,788 --> 01:02:37,290
Mm-hmm. I see how it is.

1163
01:02:47,667 --> 01:02:50,303
You're out your mind.

1164
01:03:22,636 --> 01:03:24,538
I appreciate you pitching in.

1165
01:03:24,571 --> 01:03:26,940
No, no, I should be
thanking you.

1166
01:03:26,973 --> 01:03:29,376
This is very therapeutic.

1167
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:30,844
Try it when you're stuck

1168
01:03:30,877 --> 01:03:33,080
serving 300 little shits,
and all they do is complain.

1169
01:03:33,114 --> 01:03:35,016
Then you tell me
how therapeutic it is.

1170
01:03:35,049 --> 01:03:36,683
Well, fair enough.

1171
01:03:36,716 --> 01:03:38,585
Mary.

1172
01:03:39,452 --> 01:03:40,720
Speaking of.

1173
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:43,623
Oh, brownies?

1174
01:03:43,657 --> 01:03:45,358
God, yes. I want all of these.

1175
01:03:45,392 --> 01:03:46,793
Ah-ah. Just take one.

1176
01:03:46,827 --> 01:03:48,728
The rest is for
the Christmas party tonight.

1177
01:03:48,762 --> 01:03:50,664
What Christmas party?
There's a Christmas party?

1178
01:03:50,697 --> 01:03:52,666
Yeah, at Miss Crane's house.

1179
01:03:52,699 --> 01:03:54,401
I'm only going to go
for a little bit.

1180
01:03:54,434 --> 01:03:55,802
Show my face
and say I was there.

1181
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:58,538
You know, Miss Crane said
she invited you too.

1182
01:03:59,472 --> 01:04:00,841
I want to go to the party.

1183
01:04:00,874 --> 01:04:03,543
She didn't mean it.
We were just making small talk.

1184
01:04:03,577 --> 01:04:05,378
If you don't want to go,
don't go.

1185
01:04:05,412 --> 01:04:06,880
I'll take him.

1186
01:04:06,913 --> 01:04:08,115
Mary can take me.

1187
01:04:08,149 --> 01:04:10,117
No, that's not how it works.

1188
01:04:10,151 --> 01:04:12,019
You're under my supervision.

1189
01:04:12,919 --> 01:04:15,122
Okay, maybe it's fine
for you to sit around here

1190
01:04:15,156 --> 01:04:17,024
and read books all day,

1191
01:04:17,058 --> 01:04:18,859
but I'm losing my goddamn mind.

1192
01:04:18,892 --> 01:04:20,527
- Jesus!
- Hey!

1193
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:22,129
Watch your mouth, young man.

1194
01:04:22,163 --> 01:04:23,897
Not on Christmas Eve.

1195
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:25,532
You see?

1196
01:04:25,565 --> 01:04:27,467
I can't trust him
in a social situation.

1197
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,436
Mr. Hunham,
if you're too chickenshit

1198
01:04:29,469 --> 01:04:31,605
to go to this party,
then just say that.

1199
01:04:31,638 --> 01:04:33,640
-But don't fuck it up
for the little asshole. -Mm.

1200
01:04:33,673 --> 01:04:36,443
What's wrong with you?
It's just a party.

1201
01:04:37,577 --> 01:04:40,147
- What are you afraid of?
- I don't know.

1202
01:04:40,181 --> 01:04:42,749
Shit. Now you got me nervous.

1203
01:05:37,238 --> 01:05:39,906
Mm.

1204
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:43,843
Yeah.

1205
01:06:03,596 --> 01:06:05,266
-Oh, hi.
-Oh, hi.

1206
01:06:05,299 --> 01:06:07,867
- Oh, you made it. Welcome.
- Yes.

1207
01:06:07,901 --> 01:06:09,970
Hi. Aw.

1208
01:06:10,003 --> 01:06:11,238
I am so glad you're here.

1209
01:06:11,272 --> 01:06:12,639
We're happy to be here.

1210
01:06:12,672 --> 01:06:14,141
Where should I put these?

1211
01:06:14,175 --> 01:06:15,942
Um, oh.

1212
01:06:17,278 --> 01:06:18,845
Those, I'll be putting
on my bedside table.

1213
01:06:18,878 --> 01:06:21,248
Oh! You're a wicked woman.

1214
01:06:21,282 --> 01:06:23,550
-You have no idea.
-Oh!

1215
01:06:23,583 --> 01:06:25,286
Certainly a lot of people here.

1216
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:27,254
Yeah, yeah.

1217
01:06:27,288 --> 01:06:29,656
Some family, friends from town.

1218
01:06:29,689 --> 01:06:31,092
-Oh.
-Only you guys from work.

1219
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:32,592
-Ah.
-Yeah.

1220
01:06:32,625 --> 01:06:34,861
- That's my mom on the couch.
- Mm-hmm.

1221
01:06:34,894 --> 01:06:37,597
Uh, that's my sister Kathy

1222
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:40,134
and her son Marvin.

1223
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:42,769
Oh, and that's my friend Tom.

1224
01:06:42,802 --> 01:06:44,604
He owns the men's clothing store

1225
01:06:44,637 --> 01:06:45,872
- on Bolen Street.
- Of course.

1226
01:06:45,905 --> 01:06:47,774
Yeah, and his son.

1227
01:07:10,663 --> 01:07:12,033
Angus.

1228
01:07:12,066 --> 01:07:13,600
This is Angus Tully.

1229
01:07:13,633 --> 01:07:15,336
He's one of our students
at Barton.

1230
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:18,105
This is my niece Elise.

1231
01:07:19,073 --> 01:07:21,308
"Niece Elise." Nice.

1232
01:07:21,342 --> 01:07:23,277
And this is Mr. Hunham.

1233
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:25,212
He's one of our finest teachers.

1234
01:07:25,246 --> 01:07:26,613
- Oh.
- History, right?

1235
01:07:26,646 --> 01:07:27,847
Uh, ancient civilizations.

1236
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:29,183
Ah.

1237
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:30,683
And this is Mary Lamb.

1238
01:07:30,717 --> 01:07:32,685
She is the manager
of the cafeteria.

1239
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:33,920
- Cool.

to our family tradition.

1244
01:07:41,128 --> 01:07:42,695
Come on.

1245
01:07:42,729 --> 01:07:45,665
Okay, and, uh, why don't I
get you guys some drinks?

1246
01:07:45,698 --> 01:07:47,334
-Uh, Jim Beam for you, right?
-Correct.

1247
01:07:47,368 --> 01:07:48,735
Okay, and what about you, Mary?

1248

I grew up playing down here

I think it's kind of cool.

1256

There's a purity to it.

1257
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:15,995
I mean, every child
is an artist.

1258
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:20,101
The problem is remaining
an artist when we grow up.

1259
01:08:20,134 --> 01:08:21,968
Picasso said that.

1260
01:08:22,001 --> 01:08:23,703
Picasso's cool.

1261
01:08:23,736 --> 01:08:25,239

Anyway, uh, I like your tree.

1320
01:11:23,517 --> 01:11:25,219
It's very space-age.

1321
01:11:25,252 --> 01:11:28,289
Oh! I bought it to commemorate
the moon landing.

-Yeah.

1323
01:11:33,993 --> 01:11:36,297
So, where's your family
this Christmas?

1324
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:37,997
Nowhere. I'm an only child.

1325
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:39,966
Uh, my mother died
when I was young.

1326
01:11:39,999 --> 01:11:41,101
Oh.

1327
01:11:41,135 --> 01:11:42,469
And your father?

1328
01:11:44,003 --> 01:11:46,273
Let's just say I left home
when I was 15.

1329
01:11:46,307 --> 01:11:47,874
-You ran away?
-Worse.

1330
01:11:47,907 --> 01:11:50,177
-I got a scholarship to Barton.
-Oh.

1331
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:54,081
And from there, I went to
college and never looked back.

1332
01:11:54,114 --> 01:11:56,550
-Oh, but you did a little.
-Hmm?

1333
01:11:56,583 --> 01:11:58,585
I mean, you came back here.

1334
01:11:58,619 --> 01:12:00,853
Ah.

1335
01:12:00,887 --> 01:12:03,324
Feels kind of like home. Yes.

1336
01:12:03,357 --> 01:12:06,193
And I guess I thought
I could make a difference.

1337
01:12:06,226 --> 01:12:09,330
I mean, I used to think I could
prepare them for the world

1338
01:12:09,363 --> 01:12:10,897
-even a little.
-Mm-hmm.

1339
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:12,199
Provide standards and grounding

1340
01:12:12,232 --> 01:12:14,168
like Dr. Greene always
drilled into us.

1341
01:12:14,201 --> 01:12:16,537
But, uh, the world doesn't
make sense anymore.

1342
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:19,640
I mean, it's on fire.

1343
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:21,941
The rich don't give a shit.

1344
01:12:21,974 --> 01:12:23,943
Poor kids are cannon fodder.

1345
01:12:23,976 --> 01:12:26,046
Integrity is a punch line.

1346
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,549
Trust is just a name on a bank.

1347
01:12:30,117 --> 01:12:32,019
Well...

1348
01:12:32,052 --> 01:12:34,488
look, if that's all true,

1349
01:12:34,521 --> 01:12:38,858

someone like you.

Curtis used to love Artie Shaw?

1351

You know,
we used to dance to this.

listens to Artie Shaw?

1353

01:16:12,205 --> 01:16:13,707
I was hitting it off with Elise.

1413
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:15,108
Oh. The niece?

1414
01:16:15,142 --> 01:16:16,276
Are you kidding me?

1415
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:17,644
This poor woman is bereft,

1416
01:16:17,678 --> 01:16:19,580
and all you can think about
is some silly girl.

1417
01:16:19,613 --> 01:16:21,582
-Unbelievable. -I don't need
you feeling sorry for me.

1418
01:16:21,615 --> 01:16:24,885
See? I'm just saying,
this was the first good thing

1419
01:16:24,918 --> 01:16:27,554
that came with being
in this prison with you.

1420
01:16:27,588 --> 01:16:29,323
Need I remind you

1421
01:16:29,356 --> 01:16:31,525
that it is not my fault
that you are stuck here?

1422
01:16:31,558 --> 01:16:33,627
Do you think I want
to be babysitting you?

1423
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:37,297
Oh, no, no, I was praying to
the god I don't even believe in

1424
01:16:37,331 --> 01:16:38,865
that your mother
would pick up the phone

1425
01:16:38,899 --> 01:16:42,603
or your father would arrive
in a helicopter or a submarine

1426
01:16:42,636 --> 01:16:44,871
or a flying fucking saucer
to take you...

1427
01:16:44,905 --> 01:16:47,307
My father's dead.

1428
01:16:47,341 --> 01:16:48,875
I thought your father...

1429
01:16:48,909 --> 01:16:52,212
That's just some rich guy
my mom married.

1430
01:16:52,245 --> 01:16:54,514
Give me your keys.

1431
01:16:54,548 --> 01:16:56,483
It's unlocked.

1432
01:17:01,688 --> 01:17:05,759
You don't tell a boy that's
been left behind at Christmas

1433
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:07,894
that you're aching
to cut him loose.

1434
01:17:07,928 --> 01:17:10,163
That nobody wants him.

1435
01:17:10,197 --> 01:17:12,733
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1436
01:17:12,766 --> 01:17:15,469
Let's go. I'm cold.

1437
01:17:26,546 --> 01:17:32,185
♪ O little town of Bethlehem ♪

1438
01:17:32,219 --> 01:17:37,157
♪ How still we see thee lie ♪

1439
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:43,430

1443
01:18:00,247 --> 01:18:01,915
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1444
01:18:01,948 --> 01:18:03,617
What can I do for you, chief?

1445
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:04,885
I'm looking for a tree.

1446
01:18:04,918 --> 01:18:06,453
Well, you came
to the right place.

1447
01:18:06,486 --> 01:18:09,589
Big fire sale on all
remaining inventory.

1448
01:18:11,992 --> 01:18:14,162
Mr. Tully.

1449
01:18:14,995 --> 01:18:17,264
Mr. Tully?

1450
01:18:18,832 --> 01:18:20,734
Mr. Tully.

1451
01:18:22,703 --> 01:18:24,905
Uh, Angus Tully!

1452
01:18:31,378 --> 01:18:33,313
-Good morning.
-Merry Christmas.

1453
01:18:33,346 --> 01:18:35,016
Yeah.
Merry Christmas, of course.

1454
01:18:35,049 --> 01:18:36,750
How are you?

1455
01:18:36,783 --> 01:18:39,286
Well, I've got a case
of the cocktail flu.

1456
01:18:39,319 --> 01:18:41,655
-Yeah. Have you seen the boy?
-Mm-mm.

1457
01:18:41,688 --> 01:18:44,524
Goddammit,
where the hell can he be?

1458
01:18:45,892 --> 01:18:48,228
Angus!

1459
01:18:49,763 --> 01:18:51,798
Mr. Tully?

1460
01:19:10,984 --> 01:19:13,887
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1461
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,756
Where the hell have you been?

1462
01:19:15,789 --> 01:19:18,358
I don't know. Just here.

1463
01:19:18,391 --> 01:19:20,527
Come on.
I have something to show you.

1464
01:19:26,067 --> 01:19:28,401
No ornaments?

1465
01:19:30,804 --> 01:19:34,741
Oh, I'm sure we can round up
some ornaments somewhere.

1466
01:19:34,775 --> 01:19:37,577
Uh, now...

1467
01:19:37,611 --> 01:19:40,480
this is for you.

1468
01:19:51,558 --> 01:19:54,628
<i>Meditations</i> by Marcus Aurelius.

1469
01:19:54,661 --> 01:19:56,830
For my money, it's like
the Bible, the Koran

1470
01:19:56,863 --> 01:19:59,666
and the Bhagavad Gita
all rolled up into one.

1471
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:02,536
And the best part is
not one mention of God.

1472
01:20:02,569 --> 01:20:04,805
- Hmm.
- Okay.

1473
01:20:04,838 --> 01:20:06,706
Thanks.

1474
01:20:07,808 --> 01:20:10,610
And Mary.

1475
01:20:10,644 --> 01:20:12,579
This is for you.

1476
01:20:13,814 --> 01:20:15,582
Hmm.

1477
01:20:22,756 --> 01:20:24,891
So you just get this
for everybody?

1478
01:20:24,925 --> 01:20:26,960
And...

1479
01:20:26,993 --> 01:20:28,695
Mm-hmm.

1480
01:20:28,728 --> 01:20:30,897
-Now, how'd you guess?
-How indeed?

1481
01:20:32,133 --> 01:20:34,101
Oh, and...

1482
01:20:34,135 --> 01:20:36,636
this came in the mail for you.

1483
01:21:08,102 --> 01:21:10,137
Thank you, Mary.

1484
01:21:10,171 --> 01:21:12,139
That was just lovely.

1485
01:21:12,173 --> 01:21:13,506
Oh.

1486
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:15,542
Is that an actual compliment?

1487
01:21:15,575 --> 01:21:18,445
Oh, come on.

1488
01:21:18,478 --> 01:21:20,614
You know,
I don't think I've ever had

1489
01:21:20,647 --> 01:21:23,817
a real family Christmas
like this before.

1490
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:26,486
Christmas dinner,
I mean family-style.

1491
01:21:26,519 --> 01:21:29,156
Out of the oven
and all the trimmings.

1492
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:31,925
My mom always just orders in
from Delmonico's.

1493
01:21:33,493 --> 01:21:35,562
Well, she's got the right idea.

1494
01:21:35,595 --> 01:21:38,665
Next year I'm ordering in
from Delmonico's.

1495
01:21:40,167 --> 01:21:43,870
Anyway, thank you, Mary.

1496
01:21:43,904 --> 01:21:45,639
You're welcome.

1497
01:21:45,672 --> 01:21:47,641
I'd like to propose a toast.

1498
01:21:47,674 --> 01:21:52,479
To my two unlikely companions
on this snowy island

1499
01:21:52,512 --> 01:21:57,584
and to our absent friends
and family.

1500
01:21:59,053 --> 01:22:03,057
And I realize that none of us
is here because he wants to be.

1501
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:06,493
So if there's any way
that I could make the holidays

1502
01:22:06,526 --> 01:22:09,096
a little cheerier
for either one of you,

1503
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:11,965
just say the word.

1504
01:22:12,933 --> 01:22:15,236
Okay.

1505
01:22:15,269 --> 01:22:17,138
I want to go to Boston.

1506
01:22:17,171 --> 01:22:18,939
Boston? Why?

1507
01:22:18,972 --> 01:22:20,640
Why not?

1508
01:22:20,674 --> 01:22:23,210
I want a real Christmas.
I want to go ice-skating.

1509
01:22:23,244 --> 01:22:24,778
I want to see
a real Christmas tree

1510
01:22:24,811 --> 01:22:26,247
with real ornaments,
not that stupid thing.

1511
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,548
- You said it was nice.
- It is nice.

1512
01:22:28,581 --> 01:22:30,517
Come on, let's get out of here.

1513
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:32,019
I want a real holiday.

1514
01:22:32,053 --> 01:22:34,521
We're not going to Boston.
It's out of the question.

1515
01:22:34,554 --> 01:22:36,023
You told the boy "anything,"

1516
01:22:36,057 --> 01:22:37,524
so take the kid to Boston.

1517
01:22:37,557 --> 01:22:39,559
Mary, we're not allowed
to leave campus

1518
01:22:39,592 --> 01:22:41,995
or the immediate environs.

1519
01:22:54,008 --> 01:22:56,977
I suppose we could call it
a field trip.

1520
01:22:57,877 --> 01:22:59,746
Uh, field trips would fall
under the ambit

1521
01:22:59,779 --> 01:23:02,249
of additional academic pursuits.

1522
01:23:02,283 --> 01:23:03,850
There's even a fund set aside

1523
01:23:03,883 --> 01:23:06,753
for additional
academic pursuits.

1524
01:23:06,786 --> 01:23:08,822
Mm-hmm.

1525
01:23:10,224 --> 01:23:12,792
I'll go pack.

1526
01:23:14,594 --> 01:23:16,297
I'm gonna need you
to take me to Roxbury.

1527
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:18,999
Mm-hmm. All right.

1528
01:24:14,821 --> 01:24:17,791
- Here we are.
- Hmm.

1529
01:24:17,824 --> 01:24:21,095
Boy, that's an awful lot
of stairs.

1530
01:24:21,128 --> 01:24:24,597
-Probably icy too.
-Mm.

1531
01:24:25,965 --> 01:24:27,567
Mr. Tully.

1532
01:24:28,202 --> 01:24:29,736
Right. Um...

1533
01:24:29,769 --> 01:24:32,073
Mary, can I help you
with your bags?

1534
01:24:32,106 --> 01:24:34,041
Yes, please.

1535
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:44,051
Hmm.

1536
01:24:44,085 --> 01:24:45,852
Mm.

1537
01:24:46,786 --> 01:24:48,822
Hey, be careful with the box.

1538
01:24:48,855 --> 01:24:50,824
Yeah.

1539
01:24:50,857 --> 01:24:53,394
You know, you're more than
welcome to a room at the hotel.

1540
01:24:53,427 --> 01:24:55,029
We've got the money.

1541
01:24:55,062 --> 01:24:56,729
Are you out of your mind?

1542
01:24:56,763 --> 01:24:59,133
I need a break from you two
and all your damn bickering.

1543
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:02,069
Besides, I'm looking forward
to visiting my little sister.

1544
01:25:02,103 --> 01:25:03,337
She's pregnant.

1545
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:04,971
Oh, that's wonderful.

1546
01:25:05,004 --> 01:25:06,173
-Yeah.
-Oh.

1547
01:25:08,008 --> 01:25:10,244
-Mr. Hunham. Mr. Hunham.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

1548
01:25:10,277 --> 01:25:11,711
My hands sweat.

1549
01:25:11,744 --> 01:25:13,380
It's hyperhidrosis. Sorry.

1550
01:25:13,414 --> 01:25:15,049
- Oh.
- Hey, Mary!

1551
01:25:16,816 --> 01:25:19,619
One more flight up.

1552
01:25:20,254 --> 01:25:21,955
One more flight up.

1553
01:25:21,988 --> 01:25:22,856
Yep.

1554
01:25:22,889 --> 01:25:24,858
So, you two are
going to be all right?

1555
01:25:24,891 --> 01:25:26,427
Yes, the little monster
will be well under control.

1556
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:28,895
- Mary!
- Oh.

1557
01:25:29,896 --> 01:25:31,764
Hi!

1558
01:25:34,301 --> 01:25:36,703
-Bye.
-Bye.

1559
01:25:41,041 --> 01:25:42,243
Bye, Mary.

1560
01:25:42,276 --> 01:25:43,710
Uh-uh. Where are you going?

1561
01:25:43,743 --> 01:25:45,146
-I was...
-You're not done yet.

1562
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:47,148
You have to help me up there.

1563
01:25:47,181 --> 01:25:49,816
-Yeah, sure thing.
-Come on.

1564
01:27:49,503 --> 01:27:51,372
Hmm.

1565
01:27:55,309 --> 01:27:58,045
Hey there, handsome.
You got a cigarette?

1566
01:27:58,911 --> 01:28:01,348
Nope. Sorry, I smoke a pipe.

1567
01:28:02,982 --> 01:28:05,319
How about a date, then?
You want a date?

1568
01:28:07,554 --> 01:28:08,855
No, thank you.

1569
01:28:08,888 --> 01:28:10,324
-Oh, come on.
-Mm-mm-mm.

1570
01:28:10,357 --> 01:28:12,226
Let's go somewhere warm.

1571
01:28:12,259 --> 01:28:13,960
Go ahead.

1572
01:28:13,993 --> 01:28:16,163
- I can wait here.
- See?

1573
01:28:16,196 --> 01:28:19,099
He can wait here,
read some books.

1574
01:28:19,133 --> 01:28:22,102
He doesn't mind if daddy gets
a little candy cane.

1575
01:28:22,136 --> 01:28:25,606
Thank you, but I never really
liked candy canes.

1576
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:28,042
Plus, I'm prediabetic.

1577
01:28:35,349 --> 01:28:37,917
You know, if you do want
a little candy cane,

1578
01:28:37,950 --> 01:28:40,054
I won't tell anyone.

1579
01:28:40,087 --> 01:28:43,890
Mr. Tully, for most people,
sex is 99% friction

1580
01:28:43,923 --> 01:28:45,559
and one percent goodwill.

1581
01:28:45,592 --> 01:28:47,127
Call me old-fashioned,

1582
01:28:47,161 --> 01:28:49,330
but I place value
on physical intimacy.

1583
01:28:49,363 --> 01:28:51,465
So should you.

1584
01:28:51,498 --> 01:28:53,367
You've never had sex, have you?

1585
01:28:55,102 --> 01:28:57,171
Believe it or not, Mr. Tully,
there was a time

1586
01:28:57,204 --> 01:28:59,440
when the fire in my loins
burned white hot.

1587
01:28:59,473 --> 01:29:00,940
You're full of shit.

1588
01:29:00,973 --> 01:29:03,644
No, the details
would curl your toes.

1589
01:29:03,677 --> 01:29:05,546
Okay, we're finally getting
to the good stuff.

1590
01:29:05,579 --> 01:29:07,081
Let's hear.

1591
01:29:07,114 --> 01:29:09,383
Maybe when you're eighteen.

1592
01:29:09,416 --> 01:29:12,086
Curl your toes!

1593
01:29:22,962 --> 01:29:24,398
Are we almost done?

1594
01:29:24,431 --> 01:29:26,667
What's your hurry?
I thought you liked antiquity.

1595
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,268
In class, maybe,

1596
01:29:28,302 --> 01:29:30,504
but I never think about it
unless I need to.

1597
01:29:30,537 --> 01:29:33,640
Ah. Ah, well, here.

1598
01:29:33,674 --> 01:29:36,243
What do you see?

1599
01:29:36,276 --> 01:29:38,612
I don't know.
A bunch of pottery.

1600
01:29:38,645 --> 01:29:42,015
Mm. Look at that one.

1601
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:51,225
- Candy cane.
- Yes.

1602
01:29:51,258 --> 01:29:55,162
There's nothing new
in human experience, Mr. Tully.

1603
01:29:55,195 --> 01:29:57,930
Each generation thinks
it invented debauchery

1604
01:29:57,964 --> 01:29:59,966
or suffering or rebellion,

1605
01:29:59,999 --> 01:30:02,935
but man's every impulse
and appetite

1606
01:30:02,969 --> 01:30:05,139
from the disgusting
to the sublime

1607
01:30:05,172 --> 01:30:09,209
is on display right here
all around you.

1608
01:30:09,243 --> 01:30:11,111
So, before you dismiss something

1609
01:30:11,145 --> 01:30:13,013
as boring or irrelevant,
remember,

1610
01:30:13,046 --> 01:30:16,517
if you truly want to understand
the present or yourself,

1611
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:19,353
you must begin in the past.

1612
01:30:19,386 --> 01:30:22,222
You see, history is not simply
the study of the past.

1613
01:30:22,256 --> 01:30:25,426
It is an explanation
of the present.

1614
01:30:27,494 --> 01:30:31,064
See, when you say it that way
and throw in some pornography,

1615
01:30:31,098 --> 01:30:33,066
it's a lot easier to understand.

1616
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:34,701
Okay.

1617
01:30:34,735 --> 01:30:38,338
You should try doing more of
that in class and less yelling.

1618
01:30:38,372 --> 01:30:40,441
You know, most of the kids
dislike you.

1619
01:30:40,474 --> 01:30:42,342
Pretty much hate you.

1620
01:30:42,376 --> 01:30:44,445
Teachers too.

1621
01:30:44,478 --> 01:30:46,180
You know that, right?

1622
01:30:56,523 --> 01:31:01,528
♪ I listen to the wind,
to the wind of my soul ♪

1623
01:31:04,698 --> 01:31:10,237

1630

Paul Hunham! Is that you?

1631
01:31:52,513 --> 01:31:54,114
It's Hugh.

1632
01:31:54,147 --> 01:31:56,650
Hugh Cavanaugh.

1633
01:31:56,683 --> 01:31:59,419
Ah, yes. Of course.

1634
01:31:59,453 --> 01:32:01,288
Wow. Hugh Cavanaugh.

1635
01:32:01,321 --> 01:32:02,656
Wow.

1636
01:32:02,689 --> 01:32:04,725
Oh, how are you, Hugh?

1637
01:32:04,758 --> 01:32:08,095
Oh, God, what's it been,
30 years? Um...

1638
01:32:08,128 --> 01:32:10,297
Um, this-this is, uh...
this is my wife Karen.

1639
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:13,233
Honey, this is Paul Hunham.

1640
01:32:13,267 --> 01:32:15,168
-We went to Harvard together.
-Hi, Paul.

1641
01:32:15,202 --> 01:32:17,771
Yes, we did. Yes, we did.

1642
01:32:17,804 --> 01:32:19,339
Uh, wow.

1643
01:32:19,373 --> 01:32:21,108
Uh, what have you
been up to, Hugh?

1644
01:32:21,141 --> 01:32:23,143
- Uh, still in the area?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

1645
01:32:23,176 --> 01:32:25,112
I-I'm still in Boston.
Cambridge.

1646
01:32:25,145 --> 01:32:26,580
-Harvard.
-Well...

1647
01:32:26,613 --> 01:32:28,115
He just got tenure. Statistics.

1648
01:32:28,148 --> 01:32:30,217
-Oh, Karen.
-He won't blow his own horn.

1649
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:32,286
-I have to blow it for him.
-Okay. Well, uh,

1650
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:33,587
what about you, Paul?

1651
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:35,556
Oh, still teaching.
We have that in common.

1652
01:32:35,589 --> 01:32:37,224
Uh, history, ancient history.

1653
01:32:37,257 --> 01:32:38,492
- That's great.
- Yes.

1654
01:32:38,525 --> 01:32:39,693
That's great. Where?

1655
01:32:39,726 --> 01:32:42,296
Oh, um, abroad, mostly.

1656
01:32:42,329 --> 01:32:44,865
On fellowships,
privately funded fellowships.

1657
01:32:44,898 --> 01:32:46,800
Universities
and private academies.

1658
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:48,702
Mostly fellowships, you know.

1659
01:32:48,735 --> 01:32:51,305
I'm currently posted
in, um, Antwerp.

1660
01:32:51,338 --> 01:32:53,840
Uh, just back here
for the holidays.

1661
01:32:53,874 --> 01:32:55,842
Ah. So, uh, is this your son?

1662
01:32:55,876 --> 01:32:59,146
-Well, um...
-I'm his nephew, Leonard.

1663
01:32:59,179 --> 01:33:00,814
Nice to meet you, Leonard.

1664
01:33:00,847 --> 01:33:02,482
And he's writing a book
right now.

1665
01:33:02,516 --> 01:33:04,251
Um, tell him about your book,
Uncle Paul.

1666
01:33:04,284 --> 01:33:05,886
My book.

1667
01:33:05,919 --> 01:33:07,621
It's not a book, really.

1668
01:33:07,654 --> 01:33:09,189
Uh, more of a monograph.

1669
01:33:09,222 --> 01:33:11,291
-It's nothing special.
-Don't be so modest.

1670
01:33:11,325 --> 01:33:13,794
It's about, uh, cameras, right?
Ancient cameras?

1671
01:33:13,827 --> 01:33:15,462
- Oh.
- Yes.

1672
01:33:15,495 --> 01:33:18,265
No, what he means, of course,
is the camera obscura.

1673
01:33:18,298 --> 01:33:20,601
You know, the optical
and astronomical tool

1674
01:33:20,634 --> 01:33:23,670
that dates back to the time
of, um, Anaxagoras.

1675
01:33:23,704 --> 01:33:25,339
Tell him the title, Uncle Paul.

1676
01:33:25,372 --> 01:33:26,840
He's not interested, Leonard.

1677
01:33:26,873 --> 01:33:29,343
Sure, I am.

1678
01:33:30,911 --> 01:33:35,716
<i>Light and Magic</i>
<i>in the Ancient World.</i>

1679
01:33:37,818 --> 01:33:40,354
Okay, well, um...

1680
01:33:40,387 --> 01:33:43,357
Paul, I'm just so glad
you landed on your feet.

1681
01:33:43,957 --> 01:33:45,592
You look swell.

1682
01:33:45,626 --> 01:33:47,527
You too. So swell.

1683
01:33:48,729 --> 01:33:51,264
And, uh, we'll keep an eye out
for your book.

1684
01:33:51,298 --> 01:33:52,532
-Won't we, honey?
-Yeah.

1685
01:33:52,566 --> 01:33:54,201
-Merry Christmas, Paul.
-Merry Christmas.

1686
01:33:54,234 --> 01:33:56,436
-Bye, Leonard.
-Merry Christmas.

1687
01:33:58,672 --> 01:34:00,507
What the fuck just happened?

1688
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:03,543
I thought Barton men don't lie.

1689
01:34:03,577 --> 01:34:05,379
Don't get me wrong,
that was fun,

1690
01:34:05,412 --> 01:34:06,913
but you just lied
through your teeth.

1691
01:34:06,947 --> 01:34:08,782
What I say during
a private conversation

1692
01:34:08,815 --> 01:34:10,651
is none of your
goddamn business.

1693
01:34:10,684 --> 01:34:12,285
You are not to judge me.

1694
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:13,920
It wasn't
a private conversation.

1695
01:34:13,954 --> 01:34:15,455
The wife and I were there.

1696
01:34:15,489 --> 01:34:17,190
And I helped you.

1697
01:34:17,224 --> 01:34:18,892
Why did he ask
if you landed on your feet?

1698
01:34:18,925 --> 01:34:20,527
What is this, Nuremberg?

1699
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,262
-Jesus.
-You're the hard-ass

1700
01:34:22,295 --> 01:34:23,664
constantly telling everybody
not to lie

1701
01:34:23,697 --> 01:34:26,433
and going on and on
about the honor code.

1702
01:34:27,701 --> 01:34:29,903
There was an incident
when I was at Harvard

1703
01:34:29,936 --> 01:34:32,439
with my roommate.

1704
01:34:32,472 --> 01:34:34,274
And?

1705
01:34:34,307 --> 01:34:36,743
He accused me of copying
from his senior thesis.

1706
01:34:36,777 --> 01:34:37,944
Plagiarizing.

1707
01:34:37,978 --> 01:34:39,379
Ah.

1708
01:34:39,413 --> 01:34:42,949
-Well, did you?
-No, he stole from me.

1709
01:34:42,983 --> 01:34:44,751
But that blue-blooded prick's
family

1710
01:34:44,785 --> 01:34:46,520
had allies on the faculty.

1711
01:34:46,553 --> 01:34:48,588
I mean, their last name is on
a library, for Christ's sake.

1712
01:34:48,622 --> 01:34:51,925
So he accused me in order
to sanitize his treachery

1713
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:55,295
and, uh, they threw me out.

1714
01:34:55,328 --> 01:34:57,497
Wait, so you got kicked out
of Harvard for cheating?

1715
01:34:57,531 --> 01:34:59,733
No, I got kicked out of Harvard
for hitting him.

1716
01:34:59,766 --> 01:35:01,234
You hit him?

1717
01:35:01,268 --> 01:35:02,402
What, like punched him out?

1718
01:35:02,436 --> 01:35:04,638
No, I hit him with a car. Ah.

1719
01:35:04,671 --> 01:35:07,574
You got kicked out of Harvard
for hitting a guy with a car?

1720
01:35:07,607 --> 01:35:08,942
By accident.

1721
01:35:08,975 --> 01:35:11,311
Pint of Jim Beam, please.

1722
01:35:11,344 --> 01:35:14,347
But he broke three ribs,
which was technically his fault

1723
01:35:14,381 --> 01:35:15,949
because he shouldn't have been
in the road.

1724
01:35:15,982 --> 01:35:17,584
Two dollars, please.

1725
01:35:17,617 --> 01:35:19,753
Also, he shat himself.

1726
01:35:19,786 --> 01:35:21,655
Which was the greater indignity.

1727
01:35:24,357 --> 01:35:25,759
Here you go, killer.

1728
01:35:28,595 --> 01:35:30,964
So Mr. Hunham
never even graduated college?

1729
01:35:30,997 --> 01:35:32,599
- Mm.
- Holy shit.

1730
01:35:32,632 --> 01:35:34,634
You didn't finish up
somewhere else? Who else knows?

1731
01:35:34,668 --> 01:35:36,603
Well, Dr. Greene knew.

1732
01:35:36,636 --> 01:35:38,739
Only Dr. Greene.

1733
01:35:38,772 --> 01:35:41,708
He always believed in me,
so he gave me a job.

1734
01:35:41,742 --> 01:35:45,645
Adjunct faculty,
zero respect and even less pay.

1735
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:47,347
So nobody batted an eye,

1736
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:49,516
and I've been at the school
ever since.

1737
01:35:49,549 --> 01:35:51,384
Are you ashamed
at how things turned out?

1738
01:35:51,418 --> 01:35:54,387
Not at all.
I'm proud of my work.

1739
01:35:54,421 --> 01:35:56,656
I love history. I love Barton.

1740
01:35:56,690 --> 01:35:58,059
Barton is my life.

1741
01:35:58,092 --> 01:36:00,061
I don't know what I would do
without Barton.

1742
01:36:00,094 --> 01:36:01,762
Why'd you lie to that guy?

1743
01:36:01,795 --> 01:36:04,364
Because I knew he'd relish
the fact that I'm a washout

1744
01:36:04,397 --> 01:36:06,033
and never left
my own high school,

1745
01:36:06,067 --> 01:36:07,901
and he'd probably repeat
that story

1746
01:36:07,934 --> 01:36:09,569
to everybody we used to know,

1747
01:36:09,603 --> 01:36:12,839
so I figured he's not entitled
to my story.

1748
01:36:12,873 --> 01:36:14,307
I am.

1749
01:36:14,341 --> 01:36:16,043
Yeah. Yeah, fuck that guy.

1750
01:36:16,077 --> 01:36:19,312
Yeah, exactly. Fuck that guy.

1751
01:36:19,346 --> 01:36:21,648
"Statistics."

1752
01:36:21,681 --> 01:36:24,785
But, now, you'll keep
this quiet, right?

1753
01:36:24,818 --> 01:36:26,686
No one is to know.

1754
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:29,389
I mean no one, Angus.

1755
01:36:29,422 --> 01:36:31,658
Entre nous, sir.

1756
01:36:31,691 --> 01:36:33,794
Entre nous.

1757
01:36:33,827 --> 01:36:35,362
"Ancient cameras."

1758
01:36:35,395 --> 01:36:37,064
Where the hell
did you come up with that?

1759
01:36:37,098 --> 01:36:39,432
Just trying to keep you
on your toes, sir.

1760
01:36:48,375 --> 01:36:50,343
Get up, kid.

1761
01:36:50,977 --> 01:36:53,413
It's daylight in the swamp.

1762
01:36:54,981 --> 01:36:57,317
I ordered breakfast.

1763
01:36:58,119 --> 01:37:00,720
Great.

1764
01:37:11,865 --> 01:37:14,068
Oh, you dropped something.

1765
01:37:16,103 --> 01:37:18,572
Uh, those are my vitamins.

1766
01:37:18,605 --> 01:37:20,074
Librium.

1767
01:37:20,107 --> 01:37:21,842
Yeah, it's just, uh,

1768
01:37:21,875 --> 01:37:24,145
something I'm supposed to take
for low energy.

1769
01:37:24,178 --> 01:37:26,580
You mean depression?

1770
01:37:27,747 --> 01:37:28,982
Is that rye toast?

1771
01:37:29,016 --> 01:37:31,651
How'd you know I like rye toast?

1772
01:38:05,518 --> 01:38:08,488
All right. This way.

1773
01:38:50,530 --> 01:38:51,665
Let go lightly.

1774
01:38:51,698 --> 01:38:53,500
-Ah.
-You're too rigid.

1775
01:39:01,275 --> 01:39:02,943
See?

1776
01:39:02,976 --> 01:39:04,477
-You're welcome.
-Not bad.

1777
01:39:04,511 --> 01:39:06,713
You're a pretty good
teacher, kid.

1778
01:39:06,746 --> 01:39:08,682
Too bad everybody dislikes you.

1779
01:39:08,715 --> 01:39:10,483
Pretty much hates you.

1780
01:39:10,517 --> 01:39:13,020
But you must know that, right?

1781
01:39:13,987 --> 01:39:16,656
Touché, sir. Touché.

1782
01:39:20,094 --> 01:39:21,761
-By the way...
-Yeah?

1783
01:39:21,795 --> 01:39:24,065
...what eye do you aim with,
anyway?

1784
01:39:24,098 --> 01:39:25,266
Ah.

1785
01:39:25,299 --> 01:39:26,866
You know, I've been
meaning to ask.

1786
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:29,103
When we're talking,
which one should I look at?

1787
01:39:29,136 --> 01:39:30,870
Sometimes I look at one,

1788
01:39:30,904 --> 01:39:33,606
but then I think I'm wrong,
so I look at the other.

1789
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:35,842
Yes, everybody does that.

1790
01:39:35,875 --> 01:39:37,711
So, which eye is it?

1791
01:39:55,296 --> 01:39:58,299
People don't understand.

1792
01:39:58,332 --> 01:40:00,267
This isn't tenpin.

1793
01:40:00,301 --> 01:40:02,136
No, this is much harder.

1794
01:40:02,169 --> 01:40:03,703
All these tenpin assholes

1795
01:40:03,737 --> 01:40:05,239
coming in here
like they're slumming it.

1796
01:40:05,272 --> 01:40:06,873
The hell with them.

1797
01:40:06,906 --> 01:40:08,641
Yeah. Fuck 'em.

1798
01:40:11,145 --> 01:40:13,147
Excuse me.

1799
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:15,082
Here's something
I bet you didn't know.

1800
01:40:15,116 --> 01:40:20,254
Your uniform, festive as it is,
is historically inaccurate.

1801
01:40:20,287 --> 01:40:23,623
Saint Nicholas of Myra
was actually

1802
01:40:23,656 --> 01:40:26,626
a fourth-century Greek Bishop
from what is now Turkey.

1803
01:40:26,659 --> 01:40:29,929
So, uh, a robe and sandals
would be closer to the mark.

1804
01:40:29,963 --> 01:40:33,034
Yeah, but I guess that would be
impractical given the weather

1805
01:40:33,067 --> 01:40:35,735
and all the silly but lucrative
mythology about Santa

1806
01:40:35,769 --> 01:40:39,240
and elves and reindeer
and chimneys and whatnot.

1807
01:40:39,273 --> 01:40:41,142
What can you do?

1808
01:40:41,175 --> 01:40:42,675
As Democritus said,

1809
01:40:42,709 --> 01:40:47,914
<i>"O kósmos alloíosis,</i>
<i>o víos ypólipsis."</i>

1810
01:40:47,947 --> 01:40:52,552
"World is decay.
Life is perception."

1811
01:40:58,825 --> 01:41:00,994
My son.

1812
01:41:01,028 --> 01:41:04,764
To see you again causes
my heart to soar like a hawk.

1813
01:41:04,798 --> 01:41:09,336
Grandfather,
I brought you this present.

1814
01:41:09,370 --> 01:41:11,805
Is this the hat I used to own?

1815
01:41:11,838 --> 01:41:14,308
Except grown softer...

1816
01:41:14,341 --> 01:41:16,143
You know,
this is not only amusing,

1817
01:41:16,177 --> 01:41:18,611
uh, but for a movie,
it's a fairly accurate depiction

1818
01:41:18,645 --> 01:41:20,214
of life among the Cheyenne.

1819
01:41:20,247 --> 01:41:22,316
-Shh!
-Fuck off.

1820
01:41:22,349 --> 01:41:24,385
I saw you in a dream.

1821
01:41:24,418 --> 01:41:25,985
-I'm gonna go use the bathroom.
-Mm-hmm.

1822
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:27,754
You were drinking from a spring

1823
01:41:27,787 --> 01:41:30,357
that came from
the long nose of an animal.

1824
01:41:30,391 --> 01:41:34,395
I did not recognize the animal.

1825
01:41:34,428 --> 01:41:38,665
Alongside his nose,
he grew two horns.

1826
01:41:52,712 --> 01:41:55,049
...and smoked on this matter,

1827
01:41:55,082 --> 01:41:57,418
and my decision is...

1828
01:41:57,451 --> 01:41:59,752
Little Big Man has returned.

1829
01:42:12,699 --> 01:42:15,835
Hey! Hey!

1830
01:42:16,903 --> 01:42:18,938
No. Out.

1831
01:42:20,307 --> 01:42:21,875
Get out.

1832
01:42:21,908 --> 01:42:23,810
I just need to do something.
I was going to come back.

1833
01:42:23,843 --> 01:42:25,012
Or meet you at the hotel.

1834
01:42:25,045 --> 01:42:26,913
It won't take long.
It's nothing bad.

1835
01:42:26,946 --> 01:42:30,984
Just get out,
you conniving little shit.

1836
01:42:33,053 --> 01:42:35,289
Were you planning this
the whole time?

1837
01:42:35,322 --> 01:42:38,192
Just counting the minutes
until I turned my back?

1838
01:42:38,225 --> 01:42:39,759
I wasn't running away.

1839
01:42:39,792 --> 01:42:41,162
There's just something
I need to do

1840
01:42:41,195 --> 01:42:42,296
before we go back to school.

1841
01:42:42,329 --> 01:42:43,464
Please.

1842
01:42:43,497 --> 01:42:44,831
You could come with me.

1843
01:42:44,864 --> 01:42:46,167
Just come with me, okay?

1844
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:48,169
Come with you where?

1845
01:42:49,336 --> 01:42:51,671
To see my dad.

1846
01:42:52,939 --> 01:42:54,908
Your dad?

1847
01:42:56,310 --> 01:42:58,279
That's what this is about?

1848
01:42:58,312 --> 01:43:00,914
Why didn't you just ask me?

1849
01:43:00,947 --> 01:43:04,251
Because, of course,
we can visit a cemetery.

1850
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:31,778
Excuse me. Hi.

1851
01:43:31,811 --> 01:43:34,048
I'm here to see Thomas Tully.

1852
01:43:48,229 --> 01:43:50,130
Right in here.

1853
01:44:04,478 --> 01:44:06,280
Over here.

1854
01:44:08,948 --> 01:44:11,118
Look who's here to see you.

1855
01:44:15,589 --> 01:44:17,790
Hi, Dad.

1856
01:44:18,459 --> 01:44:20,860
Hello, sweetheart.

1857
01:44:40,147 --> 01:44:43,050
You want to go sit down
for a little?

1858
01:44:45,185 --> 01:44:47,854
Oh. Come on.

1859
01:44:47,887 --> 01:44:50,090
Be seated right here.

1860
01:44:54,361 --> 01:44:56,996
There you go. All right.

1861
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:10,544
I missed you.

1862
01:45:10,577 --> 01:45:13,314
I've missed you a lot.

1863
01:45:13,347 --> 01:45:15,349
A whole lot.

1864
01:45:17,984 --> 01:45:20,387
You know, I'm still at school.

1865
01:45:21,355 --> 01:45:22,623
At Barton.

1866
01:45:22,656 --> 01:45:24,191
And it's, uh...
it's Christmastime now,

1867
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:27,027
so I thought
you might like a visit.

1868
01:45:29,463 --> 01:45:31,065
Guess what. I'm...

1869
01:45:31,098 --> 01:45:33,634
I'm actually keeping
my grades up.

1870
01:45:33,667 --> 01:45:35,269
I-I consistently get

1871
01:45:35,302 --> 01:45:37,204
the highest grades in the class
in ancient civ.

1872
01:45:37,237 --> 01:45:41,075
I'm... I'm pretty much
third or fourth in precalc.

1873
01:45:44,111 --> 01:45:46,913
And I'm in the chess club too.

1874
01:45:47,980 --> 01:45:49,616
But I don't really like
the other kids.

1875
01:45:52,386 --> 01:45:55,522
And in the spring,
I think I want to try tennis.

1876
01:45:55,556 --> 01:45:57,157
Just JV,
and probably only doubles,

1877
01:45:57,191 --> 01:46:00,260
if the coach could just forget
about my, uh...

1878
01:46:01,395 --> 01:46:03,464
Anyway, it's not important.

1879
01:46:11,438 --> 01:46:13,040
Listen.

1880
01:46:19,713 --> 01:46:23,050
I, uh... I have to tell you
something.

1881
01:46:27,154 --> 01:46:30,190
I think they're putting
something in my food.

1882
01:47:04,458 --> 01:47:06,959
He used to be fine.

1883
01:47:06,993 --> 01:47:09,496
He was better than fine.

1884
01:47:09,530 --> 01:47:11,398
He was great.

1885
01:47:12,633 --> 01:47:15,102
He was my dad.

1886
01:47:17,104 --> 01:47:19,706
Then about four years ago, he...

1887
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:22,209
started acting strange.

1888
01:47:23,277 --> 01:47:26,213
Erratic, forgetful,
saying all this weird shit.

1889
01:47:28,382 --> 01:47:31,585
My mom took him
to a bunch of doctors,

1890
01:47:31,618 --> 01:47:33,187
and they put him on medication.

1891
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:36,390
But that just made it worse.

1892
01:47:36,423 --> 01:47:38,459
He got more confused.

1893
01:47:40,494 --> 01:47:42,463
Then he got angry.

1894
01:47:44,765 --> 01:47:47,468
And then he got...

1895
01:47:47,501 --> 01:47:49,503
physical.

1896
01:47:51,371 --> 01:47:53,340
That was it.
That was the last straw.

1897
01:47:53,373 --> 01:47:55,242
They put him away.

1898
01:47:56,543 --> 01:48:00,013
And she divorced him...

1899
01:48:00,047 --> 01:48:02,349
without him even realizing it.

1900
01:48:03,784 --> 01:48:06,353
That's why she wants
a whole new life.

1901
01:48:07,521 --> 01:48:10,090
And it's easy to just stash me
away in boarding school.

1902
01:48:10,123 --> 01:48:13,060
Like half of us
are just stashed away there.

1903
01:48:15,429 --> 01:48:17,331
And I get it.

1904
01:48:19,066 --> 01:48:21,368
She never has to look at me.

1905
01:48:23,203 --> 01:48:26,273
Because maybe when
she looks at me, she...

1906
01:48:26,306 --> 01:48:29,476
-she sees him.
-No, no, no, no, no.

1907
01:48:29,510 --> 01:48:33,480
That can't be true.
She... You're her son.

1908
01:48:33,514 --> 01:48:35,782
Maybe she's right.

1909
01:48:35,816 --> 01:48:37,784
I can't keep it together.

1910
01:48:37,818 --> 01:48:40,287
I lie. I steal.

1911
01:48:41,522 --> 01:48:43,524
I piss people off.

1912
01:48:44,558 --> 01:48:46,260
I don't have any friends,
real friends.

1913
01:48:46,293 --> 01:48:47,794
I'll probably get kicked out
of Barton too.

1914
01:48:47,828 --> 01:48:50,397
And when I do,
it'll be my own fault.

1915
01:48:51,565 --> 01:48:56,303
Get sent to Fork Union
and maybe to you-know-where.

1916
01:48:57,871 --> 01:49:00,340
And nobody will care.

1917
01:49:03,610 --> 01:49:06,046
The funny thing is...

1918
01:49:07,781 --> 01:49:11,184
I wanted to see him so bad
this whole time.

1919
01:49:17,591 --> 01:49:19,626
But I also didn't, you know?

1920
01:49:22,663 --> 01:49:24,164
Because I'm afraid

1921
01:49:24,197 --> 01:49:25,566
that's what's going to happen
to me one day.

1922
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:27,367
No, Angus, Angus.

1923
01:49:27,401 --> 01:49:28,869
Angus, listen.

1924
01:49:28,902 --> 01:49:31,405
You're not your father.

1925
01:49:32,506 --> 01:49:33,840
How do you know?

1926
01:49:33,874 --> 01:49:36,643
Because no one is
his own father.

1927
01:49:36,677 --> 01:49:38,312
I'm not my dad.

1928
01:49:38,345 --> 01:49:41,515
No matter how hard he tried
to beat that idea into me.

1929
01:49:47,354 --> 01:49:51,258
I find the world a bitter
and complicated place,

1930
01:49:51,291 --> 01:49:54,294
and it seems to feel
the same way about me.

1931
01:49:54,328 --> 01:49:57,130
I think you and I
have this in common.

1932
01:49:58,231 --> 01:50:00,867
But don't get me wrong,
you have your challenges.

1933
01:50:00,901 --> 01:50:02,736
You're erratic and belligerent

1934
01:50:02,769 --> 01:50:04,638
and a gigantic
pain in the balls,

1935
01:50:04,671 --> 01:50:06,607
but you're not your father.

1936
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:09,376
You're your own man.

1937
01:50:11,378 --> 01:50:13,614
Man, no. You're just a kid.

1938
01:50:13,647 --> 01:50:15,482
You're just beginning.

1939
01:50:15,515 --> 01:50:17,551
And you're smart.

1940
01:50:18,518 --> 01:50:21,588
You've got time
to turn things around.

1941
01:50:23,323 --> 01:50:25,425
Yes, I know
the Greeks had the idea

1942
01:50:25,459 --> 01:50:27,628
that, uh, the steps you take
to avoid your fate

1943
01:50:27,661 --> 01:50:29,763
are the very steps
that lead you to it,

1944
01:50:29,796 --> 01:50:31,798
but that's just
a literary conceit.

1945
01:50:31,832 --> 01:50:33,800
In real life, your history

1946
01:50:33,834 --> 01:50:36,169
does not have to dictate
your destiny...

1947
01:50:36,203 --> 01:50:38,505
Oh. There's Mary.

1948
01:50:38,538 --> 01:50:40,641
Can you not tell Mary
or anybody? Uh...

1949
01:50:40,674 --> 01:50:43,644
Entre nous. This whole
goddamned trip is entre nous.

1950
01:50:43,677 --> 01:50:46,246
-Stand up.
-What?

1951
01:50:46,913 --> 01:50:48,849
Stand up for the lady, you boor.

1952
01:50:48,882 --> 01:50:51,284
You cretin.

1953
01:50:54,388 --> 01:50:55,956
- Mary.
- Well, hello.

1954
01:50:55,989 --> 01:50:57,958
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

1955
01:50:57,991 --> 01:50:59,793
Oh, we're just happy
to see you.

1956
01:51:01,628 --> 01:51:02,863
Madame, the menu.

1957
01:51:02,896 --> 01:51:04,665
Oh. Thank you.

1958
01:51:04,698 --> 01:51:06,933
Hello, ma'am. Would you like
a cocktail to start?

1959
01:51:06,967 --> 01:51:09,202
Oh, no,
I'll just take a cup of tea.

1960
01:51:09,236 --> 01:51:10,404
Oh, come on. Have a cocktail.

1961
01:51:10,437 --> 01:51:12,205
No, no, no.
A cup of tea is fine.

1962
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:14,207
I've eaten already.

1963
01:51:14,241 --> 01:51:16,910
And you gentlemen,
did you save room for dessert?

1964
01:51:16,943 --> 01:51:19,446
- Hmm.
- Hey, what's that?

1965
01:51:19,479 --> 01:51:21,348
That's our signature dessert.

1966
01:51:21,381 --> 01:51:22,849
- Cherries jubilee.
- Mmm.

1967
01:51:22,883 --> 01:51:24,518
That sounds great.

1968
01:51:24,551 --> 01:51:26,987
Bring the young vandal here
cherries jubilee.

1969
01:51:27,021 --> 01:51:28,955
I'm afraid I can't.

1970
01:51:28,989 --> 01:51:30,891
The dish contains brandy.

1971
01:51:30,924 --> 01:51:33,326
Same deal with
the bananas Foster.

1972
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:35,362
-Yeah, but doesn't the alcohol
just burn off? -Mm.

1973
01:51:35,395 --> 01:51:37,297
It's still
against the rules, ma'am.

1974
01:51:37,330 --> 01:51:38,632
-Fine.
-Oh.

1975
01:51:38,665 --> 01:51:40,834
I'll order the cherries
jubilee. We can share it.

1976
01:51:40,867 --> 01:51:43,336
Mm. I can't allow that, either.

1977
01:51:43,370 --> 01:51:45,772
Can we say it's his birthday?

1978
01:51:45,806 --> 01:51:47,340
It's my birthday.

1979
01:51:47,374 --> 01:51:49,342
Well, happy birthday, young man.

1980
01:51:49,376 --> 01:51:50,977
Let's get you a slice of cake

1981
01:51:51,012 --> 01:51:52,846
or some other
age-appropriate dessert.

1982
01:51:52,879 --> 01:51:54,648
Christ on a crutch.

1983
01:51:54,681 --> 01:51:58,385
What kind of a fascist hash
foundry are you running here?

1984
01:52:00,754 --> 01:52:03,457
Uh, excuse me, ma'am. Do you,
by chance, have cherries?

1985
01:52:04,758 --> 01:52:06,293
Yes.

1986
01:52:06,326 --> 01:52:08,729
Great.
And do you have ice cream?

1987
01:52:08,762 --> 01:52:10,664
- Yes.
- Fantastic.

1988
01:52:10,697 --> 01:52:14,334
Can we please get cherries
and ice cream to go?

1989
01:52:14,367 --> 01:52:15,869
And the check.

1990
01:52:15,902 --> 01:52:18,305
Right away.

1991
01:52:18,939 --> 01:52:21,308
-Bitch.
-Mm.

1992
01:52:26,047 --> 01:52:28,749
And a little James Beam.

1993
01:52:28,782 --> 01:52:31,251
All right. Go ahead.

1994
01:52:33,020 --> 01:52:35,689
Ooh.

1995
01:52:35,722 --> 01:52:37,058
Presto. Cherries jubilee.

1996
01:52:38,925 --> 01:52:40,494
Ooh.

1997
01:52:40,527 --> 01:52:42,763
-Shouldn't it just go out?
-Okay.

1998
01:52:42,796 --> 01:52:45,032
Oh, shit. Shit.

1999
01:52:45,066 --> 01:52:47,400
-How much alcohol
did you put on there? -Oh!

2000
01:52:47,434 --> 01:52:48,969
It's hot. It's very hot.

2001
01:52:49,002 --> 01:52:50,670
Oh!

2002
01:53:18,565 --> 01:53:20,433
But now just listen to them.

2003
01:53:20,467 --> 01:53:21,735
They see the ball and...

2004
01:53:21,768 --> 01:53:23,804
Man, I sure do wish
we had some noisemakers.

2005
01:53:23,837 --> 01:53:25,305
Mm-hmm.

2006
01:53:26,107 --> 01:53:28,542
I've got a noisemaker.

2007
01:53:28,575 --> 01:53:30,377
Where the hell did you get that?

2008
01:53:30,410 --> 01:53:32,079
I don't know. Found it.

2009
01:53:32,113 --> 01:53:34,548
Well, you're not
deploying that in here.

2010
01:53:34,581 --> 01:53:36,449
You know, you weren't
this uptight in Boston.

2011
01:53:36,483 --> 01:53:37,784
Oh.

2012
01:53:37,818 --> 01:53:39,553
Danny, where do you stand
on indoor fireworks?

2013
01:53:39,586 --> 01:53:41,088
About as far away as I can.

2014
01:53:41,122 --> 01:53:42,589
- That's very wise.
- Ten, nine...

2015
01:53:42,622 --> 01:53:43,957
Oh, we're gonna miss it.
Come on.

2016
01:53:43,990 --> 01:53:45,092
-Up on your feet.
-...eight, seven...

2017
01:53:45,126 --> 01:53:46,693
Up on your feet.
Up on your feet.

2018
01:53:46,726 --> 01:53:49,429
-...six, five, four...
-Five, four...

2019
01:53:49,462 --> 01:53:52,399
Three, two, one.

2020
01:53:52,432 --> 01:53:55,702

2021
01:53:55,735 --> 01:53:57,104

No. We're going to light

Why'd you put in
all that paprika?

2037

Follow the recipe.

2038
01:55:29,629 --> 01:55:31,932
Now you have to add in
another cup of water.

2039
01:55:31,965 --> 01:55:33,867
What's wrong with you?

2040

Hey, Kountze.

Does... does it hurt?

2043
01:55:44,844 --> 01:55:45,879
Fuck yeah, it hurts.

2044
01:55:45,912 --> 01:55:48,815
Glare off the slopes, man,
burned me to a crisp.

2045
01:55:50,151 --> 01:55:51,952
You think that's funny, Tully?

2046
01:55:52,953 --> 01:55:54,088
No, man.

2047
01:55:54,121 --> 01:55:56,123
Just glad you had
a good vacation.

2048
01:55:56,157 --> 01:56:00,860
Welcome back,
you snarling Visigoths.

2049
01:56:00,894 --> 01:56:04,664
I trust you all enjoyed
a refreshing holiday.

2050
01:56:04,698 --> 01:56:07,234
Oh, hello, Mr. Kountze.

2051
01:56:07,268 --> 01:56:09,502
Or should I say Icarus?

2052
01:56:09,536 --> 01:56:11,705
Fly a little too close
to the sun, did we?

2053
01:56:11,738 --> 01:56:13,107
Huh?

2054
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:14,241
Yeah.

2055
01:56:14,275 --> 01:56:15,742
Uh, all right.

2056
01:56:15,775 --> 01:56:17,711
Now, along with
your skiing and swimming,

2057
01:56:17,744 --> 01:56:19,813
I hope you found time
to enlighten yourselves

2058
01:56:19,846 --> 01:56:22,916
about the Peloponnesian War
and its implications for today.

2059
01:56:22,949 --> 01:56:25,552
Just to check, we're going
to start with a short pop quiz

2060
01:56:25,585 --> 01:56:26,987
on the reading...

2061
01:56:27,021 --> 01:56:28,922
...before we retake the final
from last semester.

2062
01:56:28,955 --> 01:56:31,524
<i>Omnia ex scrineis</i>
<i>praeter stilum.</i>

2063
01:57:07,161 --> 01:57:08,928
Excuse me, Mr. Hunham?

2064
01:57:10,131 --> 01:57:11,965
Oh, Miss Crane.

2065
01:57:11,998 --> 01:57:15,036
Lydia. Uh, come in.
Happy New Year.

2066
01:57:15,069 --> 01:57:17,171
Oh, same to you. Happy New Year.

2067
01:57:17,204 --> 01:57:18,772
Forgive me. I'm a clod.

2068
01:57:18,805 --> 01:57:20,607
I never called to thank you
for inviting

2069
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:22,176
the boy and me to your party.

2070
01:57:22,209 --> 01:57:23,210
And Mary.

2071
01:57:23,244 --> 01:57:24,345
It meant a lot.

2072
01:57:24,378 --> 01:57:25,945
Oh, you're so welcome.

2073
01:57:25,979 --> 01:57:27,314
It was fun.

2074
01:57:27,348 --> 01:57:30,317
Um, Dr. Woodrup is asking
to see you.

2075
01:57:30,351 --> 01:57:32,053
He says it's urgent.

2076
01:57:32,086 --> 01:57:33,953
Oh.

2077
01:58:03,384 --> 01:58:07,221
<i>Mr. Hunham, meet</i>
<i>Judy and Stanley Clotfelter.</i>

2078
01:58:07,254 --> 01:58:09,823
Angus Tully's mother and father.

2079
01:58:09,856 --> 01:58:11,691
-Stepfather.
-Hello.

2080
01:58:11,724 --> 01:58:13,127
Good morning.

2081
01:58:13,160 --> 01:58:15,229
They've brought something
very important to my attention.

2082
01:58:15,262 --> 01:58:16,830
We understand you took Angus

2083
01:58:16,863 --> 01:58:18,332
to Boston over the holidays.

2084
01:58:18,365 --> 01:58:20,034
I explained to Mr. Clotfelter

2085
01:58:20,067 --> 01:58:22,269
that you went on a field trip
for academic reasons.

2086
01:58:22,303 --> 01:58:23,636
That's right.

2087
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:25,372
A field trip?

2088
01:58:25,406 --> 01:58:27,974
Yes. Uh, as per my instructions
in the manual,

2089
01:58:28,008 --> 01:58:30,844
it fell within the ambit
of my responsibility.

2090
01:58:30,877 --> 01:58:33,713
Well, if it was a school trip,
then how do you explain this?

2091
01:58:33,746 --> 01:58:35,249
The people at the sanitarium

2092
01:58:35,282 --> 01:58:37,717
confiscated it
from my ex-husband.

2093
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:40,753
Apparently,
Angus had given it to him.

2094
01:58:49,263 --> 01:58:51,398
My mom and Stanley are here.

2095
01:58:51,432 --> 01:58:53,867
Lydia told me.

2096
01:58:53,900 --> 01:58:56,103
I think I'm going to get
kicked out.

2097
01:58:57,471 --> 01:58:59,939
That means military school.

2098
01:59:15,356 --> 01:59:18,225
<i>Angus knows he's not</i>
<i>supposed to visit his father.</i>

2099
01:59:18,259 --> 01:59:21,694
He suffers from
debilitating mental illness.

2100
01:59:21,728 --> 01:59:24,431
Paranoid schizophrenia,
early-onset dementia.

2101
01:59:24,465 --> 01:59:28,001
And Angus's visit created
an expectation.

2102
01:59:28,035 --> 01:59:31,771
Now Tom wants to come home,
which is...

2103
01:59:31,804 --> 01:59:34,175
clearly impossible.

2104
01:59:34,208 --> 01:59:36,310
They tried to tell him,
and he just...

2105
01:59:36,343 --> 01:59:38,912
He got violent. He tried
to brain one of the orderlies

2106
01:59:38,945 --> 01:59:40,780
with this goddamned thing.

2107
01:59:40,813 --> 01:59:43,150
You people know the boy has
a discipline problem.

2108
01:59:43,184 --> 01:59:46,187
Paul, the Clotfelters want
to withdraw Angus from Barton

2109
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:49,789
and enroll him
at Fork Union Military Academy.

2110
01:59:49,822 --> 01:59:52,059
Set him straight
once and for all.

2111
01:59:52,092 --> 01:59:54,495
He could do a lot worse
than a career in the military.

2112
01:59:54,528 --> 01:59:56,197
Stanley.

2113
01:59:56,230 --> 01:59:59,400
Look, Angus has defied me
lots of times

2114
01:59:59,433 --> 02:00:01,768
about a lot of things,
including this.

2115
02:00:01,801 --> 02:00:04,003
So, however he manipulated
your sympathies

2116
02:00:04,038 --> 02:00:08,175
or slipped the leash,
just tell us.

2117
02:00:22,289 --> 02:00:24,724
It was my idea.

2118
02:00:28,329 --> 02:00:32,832
No, uh, uh, he didn't, uh,
trick me or slip the leash.

2119
02:00:32,865 --> 02:00:35,969
No, I took him
to see his father.

2120
02:00:36,002 --> 02:00:39,839
In fact, I convinced him
to do so.

2121
02:00:42,476 --> 02:00:44,844
This is a family matter,

2122
02:00:44,877 --> 02:00:46,846
and you had no right
to interfere.

2123
02:00:46,879 --> 02:00:48,382
- I don't give a shit.
- What?

2124
02:00:48,415 --> 02:00:50,917
- Hunham.
- I said I don't give a shit.

2125
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:53,254
You two were unreachable.

2126
02:00:53,287 --> 02:00:55,122
He was all alone at Christmas.

2127
02:00:55,155 --> 02:00:58,992
I thought the kid
should see his father.

2128
02:01:00,927 --> 02:01:03,830
Do you understand
what you've done?

2129
02:01:03,863 --> 02:01:05,432
I have to move Tom now.

2130
02:01:05,466 --> 02:01:08,402
It was hard even finding
a facility that would take him,

2131
02:01:08,435 --> 02:01:12,306
and now I have to move him.

2132
02:01:12,339 --> 02:01:15,109
And that is deeply unfortunate,

2133
02:01:15,142 --> 02:01:19,879
but why compound the misery
by ruining the boy?

2134
02:01:21,048 --> 02:01:23,284
I have just spent
two solid weeks with him.

2135
02:01:23,317 --> 02:01:27,554
He is a pain in the ass, sure,
but he's also very smart.

2136
02:01:27,588 --> 02:01:30,591
Brilliant, I don't know,
but very smart.

2137
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:33,327
You must know that.

2138
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:36,230
He's got enormous potential.

2139
02:01:36,263 --> 02:01:40,833
It would be devastating
if you pulled him out now.

2140
02:01:53,913 --> 02:01:57,217
You did this to yourself,
Hunham, not me.

2141
02:01:57,251 --> 02:02:00,087
-I want you to remember that.
-Mm.

2142
02:02:01,655 --> 02:02:05,025
Hardy, I have known you
since you were a boy,

2143
02:02:05,059 --> 02:02:07,194
so I think I have
the requisite experience

2144
02:02:07,227 --> 02:02:11,632
and insight to aver that
you are and always have been

2145
02:02:11,665 --> 02:02:15,235
penis cancer in human form.

2146
02:02:40,993 --> 02:02:43,930
It's this one.

2147
02:02:43,963 --> 02:02:46,333
This is the one
you should look at.

2148
02:02:56,610 --> 02:02:59,279
Angus, step inside, please.

2149
02:03:31,412 --> 02:03:32,679
-Oh.
-Hello.

2150
02:03:32,713 --> 02:03:34,381
Hello.

2151
02:03:34,415 --> 02:03:36,417
I missed you at breakfast.

2152
02:03:36,450 --> 02:03:39,019
I was, uh... I was busy.

2153
02:03:42,122 --> 02:03:44,625
So did you decide
where you're going to go?

2154
02:03:44,658 --> 02:03:46,293
Yes and no.

2155
02:03:46,326 --> 02:03:48,729
Um, first, I'm going
to stash my stuff

2156
02:03:48,762 --> 02:03:52,433
at a friend's in Syracuse,
and then...

2157
02:03:52,466 --> 02:03:54,000
I don't know.

2158
02:03:54,034 --> 02:03:56,303
Maybe I'll start in Carthage.

2159
02:03:56,336 --> 02:03:59,306
I was hoping you were
going to say that.

2160
02:03:59,339 --> 02:04:01,241
Mm.

2161
02:04:11,785 --> 02:04:13,953
For your monograph.

2162
02:04:15,589 --> 02:04:17,124
I don't know, Mary.

2163
02:04:17,157 --> 02:04:19,626
There's a lot
of empty pages in here.

2164
02:04:19,660 --> 02:04:21,261
Yeah, well,
that's your problem, man.

2165
02:04:21,295 --> 02:04:22,729
All you got to do

2166
02:04:22,763 --> 02:04:24,698
is write one word after another.

2167
02:04:24,731 --> 02:04:26,467
Can't be that hard, can it?

2168
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:27,668
Oh...

2169
02:04:32,473 --> 02:04:34,341
What about you?

2170
02:04:34,374 --> 02:04:36,276
What about me what?

2171
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:39,313
Oh, no, I'm not going anywhere.
Mm-mm.

2172
02:04:39,346 --> 02:04:41,615
I'm not like you.
I like having a job.

2173
02:04:43,116 --> 02:04:45,085
Plus, I'm saving up for college.

2174
02:04:45,118 --> 02:04:47,221
My sister's baby.

2175
02:04:48,055 --> 02:04:50,157
Ah.

2176
02:04:51,258 --> 02:04:53,026
What is the word from Penny?

2177
02:04:53,060 --> 02:04:55,229
-Peggy.
-Peggy.

2178
02:04:56,530 --> 02:04:59,766
Only that if it's a boy...

2179
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:02,503
...his middle name
is going to be Curtis.

2180
02:05:23,190 --> 02:05:25,559
I heard he got booted
for eating feces.

2181
02:05:25,592 --> 02:05:27,127
What?

2182
02:05:27,160 --> 02:05:29,096
Apparently he got caught
in the locker room.

2183
02:05:29,129 --> 02:05:31,565
Hand in the commode,
burgling turds.

2184
02:05:32,699 --> 02:05:34,601
That's not what I heard.

2185
02:05:34,635 --> 02:05:36,603
What did you hear?

2186
02:05:36,637 --> 02:05:38,272
Doesn't matter.

2187
02:05:38,305 --> 02:05:40,140
Either way, he's history.

2188
02:05:40,173 --> 02:05:43,443
Fucker taught history,
now is history.

2189
02:05:43,477 --> 02:05:45,345
Right, Tully?

2190
02:05:54,321 --> 02:05:55,389
Hi.

2191
02:05:55,422 --> 02:05:57,424
Oh, hi.

2192
02:05:59,693 --> 02:06:01,461
Look, uh...

2193
02:06:01,495 --> 02:06:04,498
I don't know what you said
to my mom and Stanley,

2194
02:06:04,531 --> 02:06:06,833
Woodrup, but...

2195
02:06:06,867 --> 02:06:09,570
all I know is
I'm not getting kicked out

2196
02:06:09,603 --> 02:06:11,772
and, uh, you got fired.

2197
02:06:11,805 --> 02:06:15,542
Well, I just told the truth.

2198
02:06:15,576 --> 02:06:17,678
Mostly.

2199
02:06:17,711 --> 02:06:19,246
Barton man.

2200
02:06:19,846 --> 02:06:22,249
Barton man.

2201
02:06:27,788 --> 02:06:30,123
Fifth period.

2202
02:06:38,198 --> 02:06:40,867
You know, it's, uh...
it's only PE.

2203
02:06:40,901 --> 02:06:42,469
Maybe I could skip.

2204
02:06:42,502 --> 02:06:44,338
We could head over
to The Winning Ticket.

2205
02:06:44,371 --> 02:06:46,173
Grab a burger and a beer.

2206
02:06:46,206 --> 02:06:49,242
Ah. Miller High Life, no doubt.

2207
02:06:49,276 --> 02:06:51,445
You never give up, do you?

2208
02:06:51,478 --> 02:06:53,246
Well, they already fired you,
so I figured

2209
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:54,815
it was worth a shot.

2210
02:06:54,848 --> 02:06:58,685
Your logic is flawless,
but, uh, no.

2211
02:07:06,793 --> 02:07:09,529
Keep your head up, all right?

2212
02:07:14,201 --> 02:07:16,536
You can do this.

2213
02:07:17,671 --> 02:07:20,340
Yeah, I was gonna tell you
the same thing.

2214
02:07:34,955 --> 02:07:36,590
See ya.

2215
02:07:47,534 --> 02:07:49,302
See ya.
