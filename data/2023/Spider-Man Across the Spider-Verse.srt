1
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,915
<i>Let's do things differently this time.</i>

2
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,251
<i>Like, so differently.</i>

3
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:29,006
<i>His name is Miles Morales.</i>

4
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,886
<i>He was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i>

5
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,930
<i>And he's not the only one.</i>

6
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,228
<i>He hasn't always had it easy.</i>

7
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,323
<i>And he's not the only one.</i>

8
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,829
<i>And now he's on his own.</i>

9
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,503
<i>And he's not the only one.</i>

10
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,382
<i>You think you know the rest.</i>

11
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,803
<i>You don't.</i>

12
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,477
<i>I thought I knew the rest, but I didn't.</i>

13
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,564
<i>I didn't wanna hurt him.</i>

14
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,068
<i>But I did.</i>

15
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,531
<i>And he's not the only one.</i>

16
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,250
Hey!

17
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,417
Yo, Def Leppard!

18
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,255
Gwen!

19
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:55,843
Is the song over?

20
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,512
- Seems over.
- Are you okay?

21
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,472
You don't hang out,
and you don't wanna talk.

22
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:01,557
I didn't join a band

23
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,350
-so I could talk about feelings.
-I did.

24
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,853
I joined it
so I could hit my feelings with sticks.

25
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,689
Yo, if you don't tell someone
what's going on,

26
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,190
-you're gonna snap.
-I'm fine.

27
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,526
That's not how someone
who's fine would say that.

28
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,319
They'd say,
"Great. Thanks. How are you?"

29
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,405
-I'm great. Thanks.
-Whoa!

30
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,282
How are you?

31
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,242
Fine?

32
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,910
Gwen. Come on.

33
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,662
-I don't get you, man.
-You're right!

34
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,081
I play drums.

35
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,335
<i>I always wanted to be in a band.</i>

36
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,381
<i>Guess I just never found the right one.</i>

37
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,842
<i>In this line of work,</i>

38
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,595
<i>you always wind up a solo act.</i>

39
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:43,640
<i>Before Miles...</i>

40
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,559
-How many did you take?
<i>-...there was Peter.</i>

41
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:49,730
-I think you look great. I don't know.
-Is this that dangerous menace?

42
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,607
No, no, no. She seems like a good guy.

43
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,609
Why wear a mask
if you've got nothing to hide?

44
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,611
All right,
no politics at the dinner table.

45
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:56,945
Thank you, May.

46
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,157
<i>But they didn't really know me.</i>

47
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,827
<i>- And I didn't really know him either.

48
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,622
- Touch him again, Ned.
- Gwen, it's okay.

49
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,042
<i>Until it was too late.</i>

50
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,550
- Hey, Gwen.
- Hey.

51
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:21,678
Peter?

52
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,495
What? No.

53
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,997
No, no, no.

54
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,457
What did you do?

55
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,253
I just wanted to be special.

56
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:55,963
Like you...

57
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:57,631
Gwen.

58
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,592
- Gwen?
- Don't worry.

59
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,302
Who's Gwen?

60
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,889
Everything's gonna be okay.

61
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,349
Don't.

62
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,268
-Everything's gonna...
-Don't go.

63
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,021
Oh, Peter.

64
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,491
Hey, hey! Hey!

65
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,243
Peter?

66
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:32,291
<i>I never really made another friend
after that.</i>

67
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,046
<i>Except one.</i>

68
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,258
<i>But he's not here.</i>

69
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,929
<i>And there's no way to get there.</i>

70
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,014
<i>Pressure mounts</i>

71
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,933
<i>as Captain George Stacy
leads the manhunt for Spider-Woman.</i>

72
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,561
<i>Who is she?
And why won't she show her face?</i>

73
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,313
<i>Peter Parker, an innocent young man...</i>

74
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,273
<i>I've known May and Ben Parker
for 12 years.</i>

75
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,275
<i>Peter Parker ate at my table.</i>

76
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,944
<i>He was my daughter's best friend.</i>

77
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,654
<i>And I will not rest</i>

78
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,407
<i>until I find this Spider-Woman.</i>

79
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,088
Hey, hey, hey. How's the band?

80
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,008
Uh... Uh, yeah, great.
I quit so, you know...

81
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,093
-You did, huh? Okay.
-...thumbs up.

82
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,766
We, uh-- We caught a break
in the Spider-Woman case.

83
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,559
Oh.

84
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,102
That's good.

85
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,855
We're close.
I'm telling you, I can feel it.

86
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,233
Me too.

87
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,985
It'll be good for us.

88
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,487
Don't be so sure.

89
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,572
She killed your friend.

90
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,991
-You don't know that.
-What do you mean? I do know that.

91
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,119
-I was there. She ran from the scene.
-Maybe she didn't have a choice.

92
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,790
-I got a job to do, Gwen.
-It won't bring him back.

93
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:03,215
Uh, I don't wanna argue about this, okay?

94
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,175
Yeah, I can tell.

95
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:11,849
Say, uh...

96
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,270
too punk rock to give your old man a hug?

97
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:33,370
<i>All units, possible superhuman event.</i>

98
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,288
<i>Guggenheim Museum.</i>

99
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,415
-Oh. Hey, this could be it.
<i>-Suspect is Adrian Toomes.</i>

100
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,458
<i>-Also known as the Vulture.
</i>-So I'll see you later?

101
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,085
<i>We don't know the full scale
of the threat yet.</i>

102
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,378
Cool.

103
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,714
Uh, I'll call. I love you.

104
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,260
<i>49-20, on scene.</i>

105
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,012
<i>We're gonna need
all the help we can get.</i>

106
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,722
<i>It's a real mess down here.</i>

107
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,402
<i>This is Captain Stacy. I'm five out.</i>

108
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,906
<i>I need you to look alive.
Good chance our girl shows up.</i>

109
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:36,975
Yuri, explain to me how a guy
with a 40-foot wingspan

110
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,436
just waltzed
into the Guggenheim unnoticed?

111
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,813
Hey, it's New York.
Everyone's got their thing.

112
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,443
-Do we know what he wants?
-Do you speak Italian?

113
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,821
-Uh, I'm an Irish cop.
-Maybe you love pasta or something.

114
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,448
Everybody on my signal!

115
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,617
Look out for signs of Spider-Woman!

116
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:56,495
Hey!

117
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,955
Yup, we got our sign.

118
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,415
How's the manhunt for me going?

119
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,626
- You're under arrest!
- Good to know!

120
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,214
Vulture!

121
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,303
Screaming their name usually works.

122
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,101
I guess that worked.

123
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,855
I am the Vulture,
the pinnacle of man's genius.

124
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,691
You're not my Vulture.
What are you, made of parchment?

125
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:29,736
What cursed world have you brought me to?

126
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,822
You're glitching, huh? Been there.

127
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,325
-Uh, where you from, bud?
-I am an artist, an engineer.

128
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,245
Oh, great. A Renaissance man.

129
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,371
Ooh, let me guess.

130
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,291
You were having an espresso

131
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,459
in some old-timey
Leonardo da Vinci dimension,

132
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:47,588
and suddenly a portal opens up
and you wind up here.

133
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,176
-Am I warm?
-Yes, that's pretty much it.

134
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,720
Sidebar,

135
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,265
uh, maybe you could stop making a mess
of the art museum for no reason?

136
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:01,268
-You call this art?
-We're talking about it, aren't we?

137
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,940
Oh, that's cool.

138
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:09,735
I mean, it's more of
a meta commentary on what we call art,

139
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,404
but it's also art.

140
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,116
Oh, look. It's your cousin.

141
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,581
I wouldn't play with fire, dude.
You're kind of made of paper.

142
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,630
Oh, no.

143
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,245
I'm sorry.
Who exactly are you supposed to be?

144
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,371
It's classified.

145
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,748
-You're the Blue Panther.
-No.

146
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,874
-The Caped Blusader?
-No.

147
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,000
-Dark Garfield.
-Stop.

148
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,043
Macho Libre.

149
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,419
I'm from another dimension.

150
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:10,504
You are?

151
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,173
Wow! Actually, I'm not confused.

152
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:15,467
My name is Miguel O'Hara.

153
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:18,762
I lead an elite strike force dedicated
to the security of the multiverse--

154
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,222
Actually, forget it.

155
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,766
Can you go to any dimension you want
with that watch thing?

156
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,978
-It's much cooler than a watch.
-Okay. Sensitive.

157
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,897
There is a big flying turkey
from the Renaissance

158
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,149
I have to bring to justice,
so if you don't mind...

159
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,734
It's all right, kid.

160
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,236
I'll take it from here.

161
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,238
Okay, knock yourself out.

162
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,990
Why are you saying it like that?

163
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,617
- You're not funny!
- Eh, I don't know.

164
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,999
Been really fun cleaning up
your shocking mess, by the way.

165
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,041
What mess?

166
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,086
- Kingpin's collider.
- What are you guys talking about?

167
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,796
-You shut up.
-None of your business. Nosy.

168
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,631
We saved the multiverse.

169
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,551
You left a hole wide enough
for guys like him

170
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,304
to randomly get shot
into the wrong dimension.

171
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,391
Now I'm stuck putting everybody
back where they belong

172
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,560
before all of time and space collapses.

173
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,604
And don't even get me started
on Doctor Strange

174
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,273
and the little nerd back on Earth-199999.

175
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,441
Who's Doctor Strange?

176
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,693
Sounds like he maybe
shouldn't practise medicine.

177
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,487
-Sorry, captain, can't talk right now.
-Hey! Hey!

178
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,493
So you want me to handle this one or...?

179
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:29,791
Okay.

180
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,053
{\an8}He's got hammerspace!

181
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,437
LYLA, can you please, you know...?

182
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,898
<i>- Nah, you gotta say it first.

183
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,274
-Call for backup.
<i>-What?</i>

184
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:55,442
-Call backup.
<i>-Come on.</i>

185
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,195
-Please just call for--
<i>-I already called her.</i>

186
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,613
<i>But I enjoyed that.</i>

187
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,804
Spider-Woman.

188
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:24,972
Me too.

189
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,267
Are you, uh...?

190
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,434
Oh, this?

191
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,396
We don't know the sex yet.
My husband wants it to be a surprise.

192
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,816
He's really corny. But so hot.

193
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:37,150
Will you adopt me?

194
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,443
-What?
-What? What?

195
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:39,903
Guys, can we focus

196
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,447
on the big, fire-breathing threat
to time and space, please?

197
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:44,449
- Yep, yep, yep.
- Right.

198
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,880
-What about her?
-No.

199
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,214
-We could use the help.
-No.

200
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,633
-'Cause she called you Dark Garfield?
-No.

201
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:03,760
-Do you say anything but no?
-No. Yes.

202
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,804
-Why not?
-You know why.

203
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,309
Enough of this.

204
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:15,147
Take a good look at my Greek fire
from my backpack.

205
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,529
Don't let him out!

206
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,409
He'll disrupt the canon.

207
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,924
- Go to the ground.
- Will you get out of here?

208
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,634
We have you surrounded.

209
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,512
- But I'm a good guy.
- You don't look like a good guy.

210
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:49,556
You're just gonna have to shut up
and trust me. No!

211
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,393
Mayday! Mayday! We're hit!

212
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,104
We're headed for the ground!

213
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:57,147
Clear the building!

214
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,161
Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.

215
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:57,875
That's what I was gonna do.

216
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,328
Hands in the air!

217
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,788
Captain, come on.

218
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,957
-Suspect is armed.
-With what? I'm out of webs.

219
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,417
Get down on the ground.

220
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,377
Which is it? Hands in the air
or get down on the ground?

221
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,713
-You're under arrest.
-I just saved a bunch of people!

222
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,548
-For the murder of Peter Parker.
-Come on.

223
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:49,635
-You have the right to remain silent.
-You don't understand!

224
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,683
You don't understand.

225
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,464
Dad.

226
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,846
I've thought about telling you.

227
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,349
But you can see why I didn't want to.
You can see why I didn't wanna tell you.

228
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,394
I didn't murder Peter.

229
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:43,355
I didn't know it was him.
I didn't have a choice.

230
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:46,608
How long have you been lying to me?

231
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:53,866
Can you just not be a cop for a second
and be my dad here and listen to me?

232
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,995
Do you really think I'm a murderer?

233
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,249
You're in this to help people, right?

234
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,170
Right?

235
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:07,880
Well, so am I.

236
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,967
And the way to help right now
is to listen to me.

237
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,011
Please, Dad.

238
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:17,139
You're all I have left.

239
00:18:20,893 --> 00:18:24,271
-You have the right to remain silent.
-What?

240
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,856
Anything you say can and will...

241
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,816
Dad, are you really this afraid of me?

242
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,277
-You have the right to an attorney.
-Dad, stop!

243
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,737
Don't get any closer.

244
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,530
Hey! What--?

245
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,368
-Dad!
-Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

246
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:39,953
Just breathe.

247
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:42,039
We got you. Right, Miguel?

248
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:47,461
LYLA, scan this mess.

249
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,173
<i>No further anomalies.</i>

250
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,550
<i>Canon remains intact.</i>

251
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,430
We can't just leave her here.

252
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,182
She's doing this on her own.

253
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,152
I don't know how to fix this.

254
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:20,911
Yeah.

255
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,623
Well, join the club.

256
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,773
I know he's just a sophomore,

257
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:34,860
but we wanna get a jump
on the college conversation, so...

258
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,488
I'm sure he's gonna be here any minute.

259
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:41,450
He's very serious about his future.

260
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,203
Uh...

261
00:20:57,883 --> 00:21:01,762
-Excuse me, do you have an ATM machine?
-Around there in the back.

262
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:02,888
Preferably not chained.

263
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,223
- What?
- Nothing!

264
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,517
This should be simple enough.

265
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,685
Just make a hole...

266
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:11,063
grab the money.

267
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,818
Nope. That's not right.

268
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:18,237
Just get...

269
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,571
Uh--

270
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:20,864
Give me your money.

271
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:22,533
Where are you, money? Where are you?

272
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:23,450
Come here!

273
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,536
Oh!

274
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,500
Hey, who left this ATM on the sidewalk?

275
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,296
-Yo, what you doing back there, man?
-Nothing.

276
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,216
Nothing.
Everything's cool, man. It's all good.

277
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,468
-Just forgot my PIN number.
-Get out of here!

278
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:45,305
-No! Sir! Let me rob you!
-I'm going to rob your spotted face.

279
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:47,140
No reason to bring wood into this.

280
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:50,227
I've never robbed anybody in my life.
Please don't make this a bad experience.

281
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,312
"Bad experience"? I run a business here.

282
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:54,314
I'm like Robin Hood,
if he gave to himself.

283
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:57,568
Oh, wow, is this curry powder?
See, I'm a scientist. Or I wa-- I am.

284
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,612
Anyway, you've heard of Alchemax?
I used to work there.

285
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:03,949
I was considered handsome
by scientists' standards.

286
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,159
I had a little accident.

287
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,912
Give me my foot!

288
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,622
Oh, man.

289
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:11,999
I'm so sorry.

290
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:15,460
First of all, I'm not even robbing you.
This machine doesn't even belong to you.

291
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:18,964
-Belongs to the bank, the real criminals.
-You're the criminal. You're robbing me.

292
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:22,092
You know, I can't really get a job
anywhere anymore, being like this.

293
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:23,635
So I've turned to a life of crime.

294
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,637
- Why do people say "ATM machine"?
- Huh?

295
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:28,432
-Who said that?
-The M stands for "Machine."

296
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,851
Spider-Man!

297
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,352
Ow!

298
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:35,898
Hey, Lenny, how much do I owe you
for this beef patty, man?

299
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:39,067
Spidey, if you catch him,
it's on the house, brother.

300
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,487
Oh, Spider-Man. Wow.

301
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:46,408
-This is real!
-So are you, like, a cow or a Dalmatian?

302
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,659
I am...

303
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:50,787
...the Spot.

304
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:53,040
We meet again, Spider-Man.

305
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:57,920
-That's funny to you?
-Of course not. No.

306
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,588
So is that a costume?

307
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:01,548
Unfortunately for both of us,
this is skin.

308
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,633
Oh, dang.

309
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:03,675
You see...

310
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,553
I'm from your past. One year ago--

311
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:08,096
Hold up.

312
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,556
- Oh, come on.
- Uh-oh.

313
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,266
-This has been fun.
-Who you talking to?

314
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,645
-But I really gotta wrap this up.
-Are you gonna be a while? 'Cause--

315
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:23,487
Maybe just pay me now.

316
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,697
<i>Okay, let's do this one last time.</i>

317
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:28,617
<i>- My name is Miles Morales.

318
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,161
<i>I was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i>

319
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:33,747
<i>And for the last year and four months,</i>

320
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,875
<i>I've been
Brooklyn's one and only Spider-Man.</i>

321
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,795
<i>And things are going great.</i>

322
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:41,630
Hey, hey, hey!

323
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:43,048
You could hurt somebody.

324
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,386
<i>Catching all sorts of bad guys.</i>

325
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,303
Let's go.

326
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:49,888
Oh!

327
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:53,058
Can't you act like a regular supervillain
so I can catch you?

328
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:58,230
<i>I designed my new suit
with some fly ambience down the side.</i>

329
00:23:58,313 --> 00:23:59,523
<i>Aunt May moved to Florida.</i>

330
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:00,482
Done.

331
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:02,025
<i>I guest-hosted</i> Jeopardy!

332
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:06,488
{\an8}<i>Endorsed baby powder.
Apologised for endorsing baby powder.</i>

333
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:07,739
{\an8}I made a mistake.

334
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:08,782
<i>My moustache came in.</i>

335
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:10,367
<i>Moustache.</i>

336
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,785
<i>And out.</i>

337
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:13,704
{\an8}I made another mistake.

338
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,456
<i>Been developing a new twist
on my venom thing.</i>

339
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,543
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

340
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:22,713
Sorry!

341
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:25,507
<i>How much longer
can I keep lying about who I really am?</i>

342
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:27,342
I hear that new Spider-Man
is Puerto Rican.

343
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:30,596
Nah, he seems more Dominican to me.

344
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,932
<i>I mean, would they get it if I told them?</i>

345
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:38,687
We love you and accept you, even though
you have been lying to us for a year.

346
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,691
<i>Maybe in some other universe.</i>

347
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:46,069
<i>Sometimes I just wish
I wasn't the only one.</i>

348
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:48,947
<i>But I don't dwell on it.</i>

349
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:58,415
<i>I miss my uncle sometimes.</i>

350
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:01,251
Miles, I see exactly
what you're doing there, man.

351
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:04,796
<i>Even though he turned out
to be the Prowler.</i>

352
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:09,009
<i>I try to do what he told me:</i>

353
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,093
Just keep going.

354
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,553
<i>"Just keep going."</i>

355
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:15,224
{\an8}You're looking at texts?
This is the fight of our lives.

356
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:16,975
-Sorry. Just a second.
-Okay.

357
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,727
{\an8}No, no, no. Go ahead. Take the call.

358
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,605
{\an8}You turn off your phone in a theatre,
but not when you're fighting me?

359
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,398
Ah! "In a minute."

360
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:27,277
Ah! He wrote it all as one word.
That's cute, right? The youth.

361
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:29,321
- Okay, that's weird.
- Whoa!

362
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:32,824
Oh, my nose!

363
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:34,701
Sorry. I gotta be somewhere.

364
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:37,746
- Psych.
- Whoa!

365
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,998
There's bubbles now. Hold on.

366
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:40,916
Whoa!

367
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:43,794
I think this is going great.

368
00:25:44,753 --> 00:25:46,338
Still bubbles on here.

369
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:48,966
I think it's probably okay.

370
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,425
I love it.

371
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:53,095
We're figuring it out.
We're finding our rhythm.

372
00:25:58,267 --> 00:25:59,476
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

373
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,479
Hey, where'd that goose come from? Whoa!

374
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:04,648
I don't think I want this costume anymore.

375
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,859
Almost there, <i>Mami.</i>

376
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:08,819
- Smiley-face. Prayer hands.
- Oh, my God.

377
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,946
Is this your goo--?
Get it off me, get it off me!

378
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:17,327
<i>At the end of the day...</i>

379
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:21,415
I got you right where I-- Ow!

380
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:22,583
So aggressive!

381
00:26:22,666 --> 00:26:25,544
<i>...I'm Spider-Man.
No one can take that away from me.</i>

382
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:28,130
Unbelievable. Come back to your nemesis!

383
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:29,214
Don't escape.

384
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:31,425
Your costume's too tight in the back,
by the way.

385
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,686
-Yo, what's up, man?
-Uh, I'm writing an essay.

386
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,646
There's a bad guy
on the Petersen building.

387
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,523
Call the police, tell them to pick him up?

388
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:49,109
-Sounds like a slippery slope.
-Just this one time.

389
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:50,277
It starts with one call,

390
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,696
then it's walkie-talkies,
synchronised watches.

391
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:56,283
In a month, it'll be a Spider-Signal.
I'm not your "guy in the chair."

392
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,409
Are those my Jordans?

393
00:26:58,493 --> 00:27:00,287
I can't help it if we're the same size.

394
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:14,843
You see, every person is a universe.

395
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:18,222
And my job is to capture
your person's universe

396
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:20,140
on this piece of paper.

397
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:23,727
-That's blank.
-Exactly.

398
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,730
I have no idea who this kid is.

399
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,690
I don't know if he knows.

400
00:27:28,774 --> 00:27:32,319
He's gotta decide if he's going
to commit himself to his future

401
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:35,572
or whatever he's doing
instead of being here.

402
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:37,449
Can't have your cake and eat it too.

403
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:39,368
Unless you bake two cakes.

404
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,161
-Miles?
-Interest in comedy.

405
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:43,789
-How's this going? College!
-Now, son, what do we always say?

406
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,916
"On time means five minutes early."

407
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:47,251
I know, I know, I know.

408
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:51,004
I gotta get back to being a great student,
so can we make this quick?

409
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:55,300
Okay.

410
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:57,469
Miles's grades are pretty good.

411
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:58,971
A in AP Physics...

412
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:00,556
That's my little man.

413
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:02,850
...and AP Studio Art.

414
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:04,101
He takes after his uncle.

415
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:05,978
-A-minus in English.
-She's a tough grader.

416
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:07,771
And a B in Spanish.

417
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:09,064
-What?!
-Whoo! Okay.

418
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,692
- Miles!
- Are you trying to kill your mother?

419
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,902
<i>Eso no es</i> my fault.

420
00:28:13,986 --> 00:28:16,655
<i>"Esto no es </i>my fault"?
¿<i>Tú estás tomando la clase en</i> Spanglish?

421
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,115
I missed a few classes.

422
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:20,158
Oh, just a few classes.
Well, what's "a few"?

423
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:21,702
I mean, you know, like...

424
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:24,288
- Five?
- Five?!

425
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:25,289
Actually, six.

426
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:26,832
-You're dead.
-A truant.

427
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:28,375
- Wait.
- Takes after his uncle.

428
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,962
-But I just have a lot going on.
-All right. We can still salvage this.

429
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:33,297
I'm sorry, "salvage"?

430
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,382
Miles has a great story to tell.

431
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:38,093
Having a story at all seems gross.

432
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:40,762
-Your name is Miles Morales.
-Correct.

433
00:28:40,846 --> 00:28:43,473
You grew up
in a struggling immigrant family.

434
00:28:43,557 --> 00:28:46,268
I'm from Puerto Rico.
Puerto Rico is part of America.

435
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:49,438
We own a floor in Brooklyn.
Ah... Struggling?

436
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:52,107
-Doesn't matter. You're all struggling.
-I make captain next week.

437
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:55,903
Now his dream is to attend
the top physics programme in the nation...

438
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:59,615
-Whatever it takes, we'll do it.
-...at Princeton University.

439
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:01,909
In New Jersey?

440
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:04,703
No, no, no. That's too far.

441
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,122
New Jersey's too far from New York?

442
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:09,541
There's great schools in Brooklyn.

443
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:12,336
Mom, Princeton has the best
quantum researchers in the country.

444
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:13,253
Quantum. Mm-hm.

445
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:16,215
They're moving electrons
across dimensional thresholds.

446
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:18,550
-Electrons. Uh-huh.
-They're studying dark matter!

447
00:29:18,634 --> 00:29:20,511
I don't know what any of that means.

448
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:23,722
I could help figure out
how to travel to other dimensions.

449
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:26,558
-Yeah, okay.
-That sounds like a really good fake job.

450
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:30,229
Dad, when you were my age,
you followed your dream

451
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:33,690
and went out on your own
to start a business with Uncle Aaron.

452
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:36,151
-Right?
-That's different. We used to--

453
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:39,613
See, when you were born--
Plus, your mom used to--

454
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:41,990
Look, life is a journey.

455
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:45,994
You all got me into this school because
you thought I could do something special.

456
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:49,081
And now I think so too.

457
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:51,667
And the special thing I wanna do is this.

458
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:54,086
There are people out there

459
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,797
who can literally teach me
the things I wanna learn.

460
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,383
But they aren't all in Brooklyn.

461
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,185
That's your story!

462
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:12,145
Now just stick to the script.

463
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:13,939
Miles, are you paying attention?

464
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,858
Miles, pay attention.

465
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:18,902
- Ow. That hurt my tailbone.
<i>-  Are you kidding me?</i>

466
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:22,239
Ooh. I gotta go. You guys keep talking.
This is all great stuff.

467
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:24,700
Miles, wait.
Did you order the cake for tonight?

468
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:28,203
Totally. I'm-- You know, call me--
I gotta go, all right? Bye!

469
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:30,956
This kid. I swear,
what are we gonna do with him?

470
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,875
<i>All units, supervillain event in progress.</i>

471
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:35,210
-I gotta go too.
-What? You're gonna leave too?

472
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:37,546
He leaves, you leave, everybody leaves.
Why am I here?

473
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,882
I know. I'm so sorry.
But we'll figure it out.

474
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:41,800
Together.

475
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:46,805
Wow. Excuse me, I'm so sorry.

476
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:48,807
- He's lying to you.
- Jeff?

477
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:49,725
Your son.

478
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,728
He's lying. And I think you know it.

479
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:56,440
How's your essay?

480
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:59,818
-Marinating. This is part of my process.
-Oh? Oh, really?

481
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:02,321
-I think your guy got away.
-Thanks, I'm on it.

482
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,114
- You seem really stressed.
- I agree.

483
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:06,909
- You're stretched too thin.
- Yeah, thanks for the tip.

484
00:31:06,992 --> 00:31:08,368
- That was bad.
<i>- I know.</i>

485
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:10,871
-What's really going on with this kid?
-I don't know!

486
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:12,289
- Oh! Hey!
- Boom!

487
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,833
- Spider-Man.
- Officer Morales! I mean:

488
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:17,961
- Officer Morales.
- This is not what it looks like.

489
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:19,463
- Hey! Hey!
- Officer--

490
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,882
My kid goes here, man!

491
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:22,883
This is fun.

492
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:26,053
I'm on the PTA. You know how many
lemon bars I gotta bake for that?

493
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:29,223
- You left in the middle of a fight.
- I did not. It was at the end.

494
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,808
- Are you serious?
- It was inconsiderate, super rude.

495
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:32,726
And a little cocky.

496
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,270
Yeah, you got me agreeing
with the bad guy right now.

497
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:37,689
"Bad guy"?
He's barely a villain of the week.

498
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:38,774
What'd you call me?

499
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,275
-You realise I'm right here.
-Come on!

500
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,777
Everything...

501
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:43,695
...is under control.

502
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:49,368
- Unbelievable.
- Wow.

503
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:51,995
Of course we'd end up back here.

504
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,705
You know, you are just like my son.

505
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:58,126
I am? I--
That's so silly. Imagine that.

506
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,629
- Back where it all started!
- Look out!

507
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:04,883
The crucible of our connection!

508
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:08,053
Don't try to wow me with big words.

509
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,180
I do the crossword every day.

510
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:18,856
- Is it all coming back to you?
- What are you talking about?

511
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:20,065
The creation event.

512
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:21,608
What?

513
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:23,819
Ah!

514
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:26,530
-Yeah.
-Hey, we got cut off.

515
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:30,117
<i>This is our son we're talking about.
Nothing is more important than family.</i>

516
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:36,456
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

517
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,459
Destiny brought us here.

518
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:42,421
-You see now, don't you?
-I really don't.

519
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:44,339
I am your nemesis.

520
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:45,883
Dude, you are not.

521
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:49,344
You missed.
You can't contain the Spot. Ow!

522
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:52,055
You really don't remember
what you did to me?

523
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:55,017
- What I did for you?
- Uh... No.

524
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,560
I worked at Alchemax.

525
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,854
<i>I ran a test on this collider</i>

526
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:02,065
<i>that brought a spider here
from another dimension.</i>

527
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:04,526
- Forty-two.
<i>- Its home dimension.</i>

528
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,904
<i>It escaped. And it bit you.</i>

529
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:11,950
My spider made you Spider-Man.

530
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:14,328
-What?
-You ran through the cafeteria.

531
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:16,413
-He took a bagel!
-You hit me with a bagel.

532
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:20,751
I've hit a lot of different villains
with a lot of different food.

533
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,795
You make your flippy, little sassy jokes,

534
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:24,880
and everyone loves them.

535
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:29,843
But no one knows what it feels like
to be on the other side of them.

536
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:31,929
I'm just trying to lighten the mood.

537
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:32,930
I created you.

538
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:35,182
You created me.

539
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:36,892
Spider-Man, why did you create that guy?

540
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,685
I didn't. He's talking crazy.

541
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:41,605
I was in this collider room
when you blew it up!

542
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:51,448
<i>Because of you...</i>

543
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:55,244
<i>I lost my job, my life,</i>

544
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:57,162
<i>my face!</i>

545
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:59,248
<i>My family won't even look at me.</i>

546
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:00,707
I made you into a hero.

547
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:02,960
You made me into this!

548
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:06,421
Look at me! You did this to me!

549
00:34:06,505 --> 00:34:09,382
Look at me! I'll make you respect me!

550
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:11,176
Ah! Ow!

551
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:14,804
I am your neme--

552
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:21,520
Well, where'd he go?

553
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:24,063
He kicked his own butt.

554
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,609
You know we're supposed
to catch the bad guys, right?

555
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:29,277
I always do.

556
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,321
Usually.

557
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,614
- Gutierrez! Get the crane, man.
- Yes, sir!

558
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,909
This here is why nobody likes us, man.

559
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:39,246
- "Us"?
- I am trying to do right out here.

560
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:41,956
-I'm trying too.
-You need to be a better role model.

561
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,375
I'm a great role model.

562
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:50,007
Hey, Gutierrez, you can cancel the crane.

563
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:54,511
I swear, I'll quit my job!

564
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:00,309
-Do you wanna talk about it?
-Are you crazy?!

565
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:03,478
Well, men of your generation
ignore their mental health too long.

566
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:05,063
Oh, boy.

567
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:07,065
What am I even doing?

568
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:09,776
'Cause no matter what I do,
someone always thinks I'm blowing it.

569
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:13,030
I know the feeling.

570
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:18,410
So your son.

571
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:21,705
How's he doing?
You think he's gonna figure it all out?

572
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:25,209
-Honestly?
-Yeah.

573
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,002
-He's a good kid.
-Yeah?

574
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:29,505
It's scary.
He says these things that are so smart.

575
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:31,465
Cool. Well, I should probably--

576
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:34,676
And then he does these things
that are so stupid.

577
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,721
I just don't want him to mess it up.

578
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,848
Maybe get off the kid's ass.

579
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:43,060
-I'm sorry, what?
-What? What? I don't know.

580
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:46,396
And I hate
that he's not being honest with me.

581
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,023
Maybe he's scared to talk to you.

582
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:50,692
Why would anyone be scared to talk to me?

583
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:52,694
I don't-- I don't know.

584
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:55,572
It's just-- You think you're getting
pretty good at being a parent.

585
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:57,449
You think you got it licked.

586
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,035
And then they go and grow up.

587
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:04,706
I just don't wanna lose him, you know?

588
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:16,885
Well, as an objective observer
with no skin in the game,

589
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:21,765
I say you gotta let him
spread his wings, man.

590
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,685
-Like this.
-Yeah.

591
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:28,230
I don't know.

592
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:34,862
If this isn't nice, what is?

593
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:42,536
I should go.

594
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:46,081
Yeah, and catch that holes guy.

595
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:49,543
Don't worry. I don't think
that guy's gonna show his face again.

596
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:51,336
What?

597
00:36:52,254 --> 00:36:53,088
Okay.

598
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:56,884
I think I kicked myself...

599
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:58,427
into myself.

600
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:02,222
Well, this is new.

601
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:05,309
Hello? Hello? Echo, echo. No echo.

602
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:08,312
Hypothesis:

603
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:11,231
I'm going to put my head in that hole.

604
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:17,070
Hello.

605
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:19,031
Ow! Please! Ow, ow, ow!

606
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:21,491
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

607
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:24,912
That was cool.

608
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:28,540
My holes can take me anywhere.

609
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:32,586
Whoop.

610
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,759
{\an8}Excuse me. Hi.

611
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:41,470
-Sorry to bug you. I know you're busy.
-What do you want?

612
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:43,138
I know it's weird. I came out of nowhere.

613
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:46,016
But I think I'm becoming
a transdimensional superbeing.

614
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:47,142
-So?
-"So?"

615
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:51,188
I'm literally splitting
the fabric of space and time.

616
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:53,565
For you, it's just a Tuesday night.

617
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:56,276
You're acting like weird stuff like this
happens to you all the time.

618
00:37:57,402 --> 00:37:59,071
Can I have some gum?

619
00:37:59,154 --> 00:38:00,697
Oh! Whoa!

620
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:04,243
Wow.

621
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:08,080
The power of the multiverse
in the palm of my hand.

622
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,708
My holes aren't a curse!
They're the answer!

623
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:13,794
Can you stop talking about your holes?

624
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:15,546
You're making everyone uncomfortable.

625
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:19,842
No, no, no. You're gonna love this.
Look, look, look.

626
00:38:19,925 --> 00:38:23,470
I'm out of spots,
wouldn't you know it. Uh...

627
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:25,514
As you were, gentlemen.

628
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:27,850
I'm coming for you, Spider-Man!

629
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:29,977
Take this one step at a time.

630
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,396
Does anybody have
the instructions for this building?

631
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:35,440
Oh, no.

632
00:38:35,524 --> 00:38:37,901
Tomorrow morning, Spider-Man,
page one, with a decent picture.

633
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,403
-You're right, boss.
-Shut up.

634
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:40,487
-Uh-huh.
-Get out of here!

635
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:41,989
You got it, boss. I'm on it.

636
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:43,782
I need a raise.

637
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:49,454
Miguel, it's Peter. We got an anomaly.

638
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:51,290
<i>Thank you, Peter. You're one of our best.</i>

639
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:53,625
<i>- Jess, who's on this?

640
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:02,676
There you go.

641
00:39:07,556 --> 00:39:08,599
-Have you seen Miles?
-No.

642
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,103
Nope.

643
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,815
Have you seen Miles?

644
00:39:16,899 --> 00:39:18,609
- What are you doing?
- Speech!

645
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:20,736
-Okay, everybody.
-No. I'm terrible at speeches.

646
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:23,488
Oh, dear God, no.

647
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:26,533
Rio, come on.

648
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:29,494
Um... Hi.

649
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:31,455
And I want you to know,
no matter what,

650
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:33,415
even though we've had our ups and downs,

651
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:36,001
- I'm so proud of you today, and every day.
- Hey.

652
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,504
-Parentheses. Mostly. LOL.
-Hey.

653
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:41,882
Hey, Mr Spider-Man,
it won't fit on one cake.

654
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:45,427
Can't you write smaller?

655
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:47,763
Can't you write shorter?

656
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:50,641
Come again!

657
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,602
What else can I say about Jeff?

658
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:58,398
That he was almost 10 pounds as a baby.
I know you're gonna be embarrassed.

659
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:00,859
He almost killed his mother.
Look at those shoulders.

660
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:02,653
- Oh, no. Okay. That's it.
- A big baby.

661
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:04,404
-Okay, okay.
-Oh, my God.

662
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:07,199
He's so funny.

663
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:09,201
I'll take the mic.
No more mics for you, okay?

664
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:11,453
- Thank you, Rio, for that.
- Where is that kid?

665
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:14,915
<i>I didn't always know
what I wanted to do in life.</i>

666
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:18,252
<i>I was pulled in a lot
of different directions when I was young.</i>

667
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:21,421
<i>Me and my brother came up
in this neighbourhood.</i>

668
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:23,757
<i>Just a couple of knuckleheads
running the streets.</i>

669
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:26,468
It is I, the Armadillo-- Oh!

670
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:30,138
You guys used
to chase us out of your stores.

671
00:40:30,222 --> 00:40:32,933
{\an8}<i>And now, if you can believe it,
it's my job to look out for you.</i>

672
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,561
{\an8}<i>-And then I had a kid.
</i>-Stop, thief!

673
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:39,565
<i>And everything changed for the better.</i>

674
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:40,941
Oh, no.

675
00:40:41,024 --> 00:40:44,903
<i>I don't even know about giving a toast
'cause I should be toasting you all.</i>

676
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:46,196
No, no, no!

677
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:51,368
So to my brother,
who we miss every single day.

678
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,038
He's definitely up there
laughing at me right now.

679
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:57,583
They're making me captain, bro.

680
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:00,377
To my wife, <i>mi amor.</i>

681
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,881
I can't even start
because I'll never stop.

682
00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:05,340
Have to take the mic from me.

683
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,135
And to my son...

684
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:18,520
The reason that I do any of this
in the first place.

685
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:21,565
I love you, Miles.

686
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:27,529
And I will always, always be here for you.

687
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:35,787
Benny, man. Come on, drop the beat!

688
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:39,917
I'm gonna kill that kid.

689
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,668
Hey! Congrats, Jeff!

690
00:41:41,752 --> 00:41:44,421
-Hey! Hey, hey.
-Thank you for coming.

691
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:05,025
-Hey, Miles. Where have you been?
-What's up, man?

692
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,403
- You keeping your head up at that school?
- Oh, yeah, you bet.

693
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:11,448
<i>Hola,</i> Miles! Hi.

694
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:13,909
-Your parents have been looking for you.
-I don't know why.

695
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:15,619
-I've just been here the whole time.
<i>-Oye.</i>

696
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:17,621
-Ah! Hi.
-You were supposed to be here at 5.

697
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:19,540
-I know.
-You disrespected your dad.

698
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:21,750
- Yup. Mm-hm.
- Missed his beautiful toast.

699
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:25,629
Come on. Did you even see the cakes?
There's some heartfelt messages on them.

700
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:30,926
That's not what I meant.

701
00:42:31,009 --> 00:42:33,136
Your dad studied for eight months.

702
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,805
Nine. It was like giving birth.

703
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:36,056
-No, it wasn't.
-Of course not.

704
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:38,684
You made us sit in that office
and talk to that lady without you.

705
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:41,395
-There was an emergency.
-What, a graffiti emergency?

706
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:43,564
A partying-with-some-friends-
I've-never-met emergency?

707
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:44,523
Explain yourself.

708
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:46,733
Sounds like
you're explaining it pretty well.

709
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:49,903
-That's funny. Jeff, we got a funny son.
-I'm not laughing.

710
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:58,078
- I don't feel grown-up.
- Wow, this is a cool shirt.

711
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:00,998
Okay! Okay, okay.
Have you checked out the spread?

712
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:05,043
<i>-Oye!
</i>-Ah!

713
00:43:05,127 --> 00:43:06,378
Who you running around with?

714
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:08,297
-Just--
-Is it Ganke? I never liked him.

715
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,423
Yes, you did.

716
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:11,675
-He calls me by my first name.
-Ugh. We hate that.

717
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:13,927
-I have more friends than just Ganke.
-Like who?

718
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:15,971
Well, there's-- There's Peter.

719
00:43:16,054 --> 00:43:18,849
You know, uh, but he left town.

720
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:21,393
Um, there's-- There's Gwanda.

721
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:23,937
You know, she also left town.

722
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:26,440
-Miles, <i>dame un </i>break.
-Is that Spanglish?

723
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:32,154
Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe I'm just doing benign, private,

724
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:34,489
unremarkable things
when I'm not with you guys?

725
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:35,574
-Nope.
-Never.

726
00:43:35,657 --> 00:43:38,118
I am 15 years old.
I am basically an adult.

727
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:40,037
-Oh, right.
-You don't have a driver's licence.

728
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,747
-Neither does Mom!
-We live in New York

729
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,415
and never plan to leave.

730
00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:45,584
-It's my life.
-It's not your life.

731
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:49,004
It's mine and your father's
and your <i>abuelos' y abuelas',</i>

732
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:52,424
who put you in this spot
that I'd give anything to be in.

733
00:43:52,508 --> 00:43:54,343
All right. Whatever, whatever.

734
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:58,347
"Whatever"?

735
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,349
-Wow.
-"Whatever"?

736
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:03,894
-Do I get to say it? Please tell me I can.
-Say it.

737
00:44:03,977 --> 00:44:05,103
-You're grounded!
-What?

738
00:44:05,187 --> 00:44:06,438
-Oh, yeah!
-For how long?

739
00:44:06,522 --> 00:44:09,608
-A month!
-Dad. Mom, are you--? Seriously?

740
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:10,817
Yeah, dead serious.

741
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:12,945
-You don't understand.
-You are right.

742
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:16,240
I have no idea what's going on with you!
So why don't you tell me?

743
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:18,158
Just listen to me!

744
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:21,828
Okay, champ, you got it. Go for it.
Say whatever you wanna say.

745
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:24,081
What do you got to tell me so bad?

746
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:36,468
You know what? Never mind.

747
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:41,265
All right, great, walk away.

748
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:43,642
Because now you got two months!

749
00:44:47,145 --> 00:44:48,397
That was good, right?

750
00:44:57,906 --> 00:44:59,157
Two months.

751
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:02,911
I'm Spider-Man. I'm not grounded.

752
00:45:55,464 --> 00:45:56,298
Miles!

753
00:45:57,132 --> 00:45:57,966
Miles!

754
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,968
You got a minute?

755
00:46:00,052 --> 00:46:01,220
Oh! Whoa!

756
00:46:01,303 --> 00:46:03,305
How did you get--?

757
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:07,226
How did you get--? How have you been?

758
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:08,769
Uh, I've been good.

759
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:11,396
I've been-- Yeah, just great. Look at you.

760
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,065
You, uh-- You grew, huh?

761
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:17,861
-Had a little growth spurt?
-Uh, yeah. Your hair has gotten pinker.

762
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:20,572
-Is this the room you grew up in?
-It is. Um...

763
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:23,867
But my dorm room is very adult.

764
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:26,495
Cool. Yeah, no, I used to play with these
when I was younger too.

765
00:46:26,578 --> 00:46:29,081
-Uh, that's a collectible.
-I used to have this one.

766
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:32,793
-An extremely rare, highly sought--
-Why is it still in the package?

767
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:34,962
Eee! Um...

768
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:37,130
That's fine.

769
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,468
-Are these your drawings? They're good.
-Hey. What? No.

770
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:46,682
Wow, there's so many.

771
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:49,268
Missed you too.

772
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:52,896
So, what are you doing here?

773
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,650
I mean, I thought I'd never see you again.

774
00:46:58,026 --> 00:46:59,194
Wanna get out of here?

775
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:02,531
I'm grounded.

776
00:47:03,282 --> 00:47:04,116
Bummer.

777
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:09,496
Is Spider-Man grounded?

778
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:11,081
Um...

779
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:14,293
I mean, I...

780
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:22,092
Miles?

781
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:24,261
Your dad's ready to listen now.

782
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,478
That's three months!

783
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,440
Wait, hold on.

784
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:40,402
There's an elite society
with all the best Spider-People in it?

785
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:42,571
-Okay, so there's this lady, Jess Drew.
-Uh-huh?

786
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,072
-She rides a motorcycle.
-Motorcycle?

787
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:45,782
Oh, my gosh,
I'm learning so much from her.

788
00:47:45,866 --> 00:47:47,784
Oh, yeah. I've learned a lot of stuff too.

789
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:50,579
I've levelled up my whole thing. See?

790
00:47:50,662 --> 00:47:51,747
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

791
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,498
- Let's see it, then.
- Let's go.

792
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:54,583
Thread the needle.

793
00:47:58,795 --> 00:47:59,630
Whoa!

794
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:03,967
Easy.

795
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:05,677
And Miguel.

796
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:07,638
- The whole thing was his idea.
- Right.

797
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:09,640
And who's Miguel?

798
00:48:09,723 --> 00:48:13,185
Oh, he's like a
ninja-vampire-Spider-Man but a good guy.

799
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:16,104
A vampire good guy.
I'd pay good money to see that.

800
00:48:16,188 --> 00:48:20,234
-So how long ago did they invite you?
-Only like a few months ago.

801
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:24,112
- "Months" is kind of a long time.
- Okay, this one counts for two.

802
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:30,827
Ha, ha!

803
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:31,912
Look at you.

804
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:33,580
Look at me.

805
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:36,625
Keep the change.

806
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:38,544
-So this club.
-Look at that dum-dum.

807
00:48:38,627 --> 00:48:40,087
What kind of stuff do you do?

808
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,713
Guy in the stripes, ten points.

809
00:48:41,797 --> 00:48:43,882
We're trying to keep the multiverse
from collapsing.

810
00:48:43,966 --> 00:48:45,467
I thought we did that already.

811
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:48,387
Like, last week we had this mission
to some Shakespeare dimension.

812
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,138
- What?
- And Hobie and I just, like--

813
00:48:50,222 --> 00:48:52,891
- Who's Hobie?
- Oh, my gosh, you would love him.

814
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:55,018
He lets me crash
in his dimension sometimes.

815
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:57,312
What does that mean,
you stay overnight or...?

816
00:48:57,396 --> 00:49:00,274
Anyway, they're pretty strict
about where I go,

817
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:02,401
or I really would have come
to see you sooner.

818
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:05,737
Right. So, uh-- So why'd you come now?

819
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:08,156
Don't do that.

820
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:13,078
Hey, Gw-- Uh, Gwen?

821
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:15,080
Where'd you go?

822
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:19,459
Where did she go?

823
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,515
- Ah!
- Oh, hey. There you are.

824
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,350
-What were you doing?
-Waiting for you.

825
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:50,782
No, it's not the Greek burger place.

826
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:54,536
- This is a cool thinking spot.
- Right?

827
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,624
Who needs a treadmill when you have
the Williamsburgh Bank Building?

828
00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:03,837
So, uh, you and your dad.

829
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:05,714
You still haven't talked?

830
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:09,218
What exactly would we talk about?

831
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:11,678
"Hey, Dad, how have
the last few months been?

832
00:50:12,471 --> 00:50:14,515
You still think
I murdered my best friend?"

833
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:18,227
I don't know.

834
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:21,104
I mean, my parents--
I mean, maybe if I told them--

835
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:22,022
Don't.

836
00:50:22,814 --> 00:50:24,233
Trust me on that.

837
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:41,708
Well...

838
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:46,129
Maybe some things
are supposed to be just for us.

839
00:50:47,965 --> 00:50:48,799
Hm.

840
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:52,344
That's a nice way to think about it.

841
00:50:53,762 --> 00:50:57,057
I'm just a really
emotionally intelligent guy.

842
00:50:57,766 --> 00:50:59,142
Beyond my years.

843
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:04,982
It really is always so great
to talk to you.

844
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:06,900
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

845
00:51:08,861 --> 00:51:12,197
I mean, how many people
can you talk to about this stuff?

846
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:14,658
You don't even know.

847
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:19,997
What?

848
00:51:21,832 --> 00:51:25,460
You're the only friend
I've ever really made after Peter died.

849
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:29,256
Other than Hobie, right?

850
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:33,594
-That's different.
-Yeah? How's that?

851
00:51:33,677 --> 00:51:34,761
I don't know.

852
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:37,890
You and me, it's...

853
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:39,641
We're the same.

854
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:45,230
In the important ways, you know?

855
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:51,820
In every other universe,
Gwen Stacy falls for Spider-Man.

856
00:51:58,285 --> 00:52:01,121
And in every other universe,

857
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:03,415
it doesn't end well.

858
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:18,263
Well, there's a first time
for everything, right?

859
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:43,622
-Mmm! Oh, wow. Feelings make me hungry.
-Oh, yeah,

860
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:46,416
these <i>plátanos </i>are
just deep-fried feelings.

861
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:49,920
She looks old enough to vote.

862
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:53,382
I bet she doesn't even speak Spanish.

863
00:52:53,465 --> 00:52:55,008
Well, <i>qué barbaridad.</i>

864
00:52:55,884 --> 00:52:58,303
This keeps you from glitching
in other dimensions?

865
00:52:58,387 --> 00:52:59,388
Yeah. Pretty cool.

866
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:02,724
What's it gonna take
for Miguel O'Hara to notice Miles Morales?

867
00:53:02,808 --> 00:53:04,810
I'll put in a good word.

868
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:07,354
I'm just saying, if I had a watch,
I could come with you.

869
00:53:07,437 --> 00:53:09,731
-Miles, look--
-I did save the multiverse.

870
00:53:09,815 --> 00:53:11,984
It's a really small, elite strike force.

871
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:14,653
I can turn invisible.
I have, like, electric powers.

872
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:16,446
-There aren't a lot of slots.
-Think about it.

873
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:19,616
Ah, right.

874
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,618
Look, if it was up to me, you--

875
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:23,245
I know. I know, I know.

876
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:26,874
Oh, no. No, no.

877
00:53:26,957 --> 00:53:29,459
-Don't do that. Miles!
-All right.

878
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:31,086
-It's, uh, really delicate.
-Geez.

879
00:53:32,504 --> 00:53:35,382
Sorry. I didn't mean to, um, snap.

880
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:37,467
Okay. All right. I'm sorry.

881
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:39,219
Hello! Hi.

882
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:41,346
-Oh, boy.
-I'm Miles's mom.

883
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:44,433
Rio! Hi! I've heard so much about you.

884
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:46,685
You're using my first name. Okay.

885
00:53:46,768 --> 00:53:49,605
This is nice.
We found it in Miles's room, so...

886
00:53:49,688 --> 00:53:53,025
-I guess you must've been there, huh?
-And you must be Jeff.

887
00:53:53,108 --> 00:53:55,068
She called me Jeff.
That's very sweet. "Jeff."

888
00:53:55,152 --> 00:53:56,987
You must mean Lieutenant Morales.

889
00:53:57,070 --> 00:53:59,573
Soon to be Captain Morales.

890
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:01,033
Ah! Captain.

891
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,495
Gwanda and I are friends from school.

892
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:08,165
-Yeah, we were just catching up.
-Oh...

893
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:09,499
Don't take him from me.

894
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:10,417
Mom.

895
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:13,712
I'm just kidding.
He's grounded, so you can't.

896
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:15,130
-Don't break his heart.
-Mom!

897
00:54:15,214 --> 00:54:17,633
<i>-Alpha Squad, Zero Red Spider Alert.
</i>-Shoot, I have to go.

898
00:54:17,716 --> 00:54:20,469
-Really?
-Yeah, I forgot to get my steps in.

899
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:22,971
Really, really wish I could stay longer.

900
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:24,389
I'm sorry.

901
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:26,016
Goodbye.

902
00:54:30,312 --> 00:54:31,313
Yeah, bye.

903
00:55:06,765 --> 00:55:09,184
I can hear you being quiet, Mom.

904
00:55:10,185 --> 00:55:11,603
I, um...

905
00:55:11,687 --> 00:55:13,772
I hope I didn't ice your game, man.

906
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:17,734
No one my age says those words
in that order, Mom.

907
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:23,991
It's just hard to see my little man
not be my little boy all the time.

908
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:26,702
Yeah.

909
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:34,501
<i>Papá,</i> you know you can tell me anything.

910
00:55:44,636 --> 00:55:45,470
Well...

911
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,241
I'm...

912
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:14,416
I'm sorry I was late.

913
00:56:24,134 --> 00:56:24,968
Go.

914
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,973
She seems like a nice girl.

915
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:34,478
-Is this a trick?
-It's not a trick.

916
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:36,313
Geez.

917
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:37,314
What are you--?

918
00:56:37,856 --> 00:56:39,274
Let me fix you. Just...

919
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:43,695
For years I've been taking care
of this little boy, right?

920
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,573
Making sure he's loved,

921
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:50,577
that he feels like he belongs
wherever he wants to be.

922
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:55,749
He wants to go out into the world
and do great big things.

923
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,544
And what I worry about most...

924
00:57:00,045 --> 00:57:02,673
is they won't look out for you like us.

925
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:06,385
They won't root for you like us.

926
00:57:08,887 --> 00:57:11,598
So here's the deal.

927
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:14,142
Wherever you go from here,

928
00:57:14,226 --> 00:57:17,229
you have to promise to take care
of that little boy for me.

929
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:20,357
Make sure he never forgets
where he came from.

930
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,862
And he never doubts that he's loved.

931
00:57:26,113 --> 00:57:31,618
And he never lets anyone at those big,
fancy places he's gonna be in

932
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:35,038
tell him that he doesn't belong there.

933
00:57:36,331 --> 00:57:39,334
And when he comes home,
and he better come home...

934
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:42,838
you're gonna be early,

935
00:57:43,422 --> 00:57:46,508
and you're gonna be holding
a normal, nice cake.

936
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:47,926
Yeah, okay.

937
00:57:49,011 --> 00:57:50,137
You gotta promise, Miles.

938
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:51,930
I promise.

939
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:53,682
Just...

940
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:57,728
-don't get lost.
-Mm-hm. Okay.

941
00:57:59,438 --> 00:58:00,564
All right.

942
00:58:01,523 --> 00:58:02,441
Cool.

943
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,868
Now go. Get out of here.

944
00:58:16,038 --> 00:58:17,831
And when you come back,
you're still grounded.

945
00:58:17,915 --> 00:58:18,999
Ha, ha!

946
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:21,418
Yeah, I'm smiling like it's a joke,
but it's true.

947
00:58:21,502 --> 00:58:22,753
Yeah, I figured.

948
00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:24,588
See you later.

949
00:58:25,506 --> 00:58:26,507
With a cake.

950
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:19,560
Shoot.

951
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:24,273
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, the car!

952
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:34,950
Shoot.

953
00:59:44,168 --> 00:59:46,295
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot.

954
00:59:55,804 --> 00:59:57,723
- Show me what happened.
<i>- Replay commencing.</i>

955
00:59:57,806 --> 01:00:00,893
<i>Spots. That's the thing.
I need more spots!</i>

956
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:05,022
<i>Ha! Oh, my gosh. It was right under
where my nose would've been.</i>

957
01:00:05,105 --> 01:00:07,774
<i>I just need a little bit more
dimensional juice or whatever.</i>

958
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:08,942
-Shoot.
-Shoot!

959
01:00:09,026 --> 01:00:11,486
<i>Never came up with a good name.
Branding was never my strong suit.</i>

960
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,906
<i>The city power line
to my micro collider prototype</i>

961
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:16,909
<i>could generate a little more
concentrated dark energy.</i>

962
01:00:16,992 --> 01:00:18,076
Shoot.

963
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,329
<i>This is what I love about science!</i>

964
01:00:20,412 --> 01:00:21,413
Shoot!

965
01:00:21,496 --> 01:00:24,458
<i>I just need enough to get me somewhere
with a full-size collider.</i>

966
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:32,007
<i>And, Spider-Man, I'll make you pay
for everything you took away from me.</i>

967
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:33,717
<i>All right, this is gonna work.</i>

968
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:36,637
<i>Or vaporise me
and everything in this building,</i>

969
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,097
<i>which would not be good.</i>

970
01:00:39,181 --> 01:00:40,265
-Shoot.
-Shoot.

971
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:56,406
<i>Oh, man.</i>

972
01:01:00,661 --> 01:01:01,870

-Gwen, Gwen, Gwen!
<i>-Gwen. Hi.</i>

<i>Whatcha doing?</i>

977
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:18,303
Nothing. Uh, good. All good.
Yeah, everything's good.

978
01:01:18,387 --> 01:01:19,221
Bye.

<i>Where's the bad guy
you were supposed to monitor?</i>

980
01:01:22,558 --> 01:01:23,976
He just stepped out for a moment.

01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:25,811
<i>-Dude!
</i>-He's just some villain of the week.

<i>-LYLA!

985
01:01:31,024 --> 01:01:32,818
<i>Hold on. Slippery guy.</i>

986
01:01:33,694 --> 01:01:35,612
<i>-Did you go see your little friend?
</i>-What? No.

987
01:01:35,696 --> 01:01:36,822
- <i> Miles?
</i>-I mean...

988
01:01:36,905 --> 01:01:38,240
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

989
01:01:38,323 --> 01:01:41,076
-Only briefly. From afar.
<i>-How far?</i>

990
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:44,288
Like, you know, about this:

991
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:46,290
-About this far.
<i>-That's way too close.</i>

992
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:47,749
<i>Girl!</i>

993
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:50,169
Look, I had to know how he was.

994
01:01:50,252 --> 01:01:53,005
<i>-I honestly can't with you.
</i>-I know I messed up, okay?

995
01:01:53,088 --> 01:01:54,882
<i>He can't be part of this.</i>

996
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:56,133
I know.

997
01:01:56,925 --> 01:02:00,012
- I'll never see him again. All right?
<i>- No kidding.</i>

998
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:02,890
<i>-Hey, guys? He's making his own portals.
-What?</i>

999
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:06,310
<i>He can jump wherever he wants.
He could be a total canon killer.</i>

1000
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:09,605
<i>You said he was the villain of the week.
Do you know how bad this is for you?</i>

1001
01:02:09,688 --> 01:02:11,899
<i>Every dimension he stops at
has an Alchemax.</i>

1002
01:02:11,982 --> 01:02:13,567
<i>-What's he up to, Gwen?
</i>-I don't know.

1003
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:16,069
<i>He's making himself more powerful
so he can beat me.</i>

1004
01:02:16,153 --> 01:02:18,655
<i>Amazing. My star pupil, everyone.</i>

1005
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:21,283
I'll get him, okay? I can get backup.

1006
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:23,702
If Miguel finds out I let you come--

1007
01:02:23,785 --> 01:02:26,330
<i>Don't tell Miguel. He'll kick me out and--</i>

1008
01:02:26,914 --> 01:02:28,123
What if he sends me home?

1009
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:32,503
{\an8}<i>I got him. Earth-50101.</i>

1010

{\an8}<i>What do you wanna do?</i>

1011
01:02:36,924 --> 01:02:38,425
You never made a mistake?

1012
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:41,011
Never got too close to someone?

1013
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:42,095
<i>I did.</i>

1014
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:44,723
<i>But I got over it.</i>

1015
01:02:48,227 --> 01:02:50,646
<i>Alert the local Spider.
Tell him Gwen will meet him there.</i>

1016
01:02:50,729 --> 01:02:51,563
<i>I'm on it.</i>

1017
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:55,192
-Thank you. I won't let you down again.
<i>-Okay. You're welcome. Shut up.</i>

1018
01:02:56,109 --> 01:02:57,945
<i>You got an hour to fix this.</i>

1019
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,280
<i>Or I can't help you.</i>

1020
01:03:28,517 --> 01:03:29,643
Goodbye, Miles.

1021
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:39,463
Sorry. Congratulations!

1022
01:04:52,768 --> 01:04:54,061
You see that? This is incredible.

1023
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:55,729
- I'm like a new person.
- Where did you go?

1024
01:04:55,812 --> 01:04:57,564
In the mirror,
I wouldn't recognise myself.

1025
01:04:57,648 --> 01:05:00,192
- Stay still.
- I'd envy that person I was looking at.

1026
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:02,569
- I have eyes on the anomaly.
<i>-  Try getting hands on him.</i>

1027
01:05:02,653 --> 01:05:03,946
Stop hovering. You're hovering.

1028
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:05,531
Hello, pardon me, locals.

1029
01:05:05,614 --> 01:05:08,242
Wow, four on there. That's very dangerous.

1030
01:05:08,325 --> 01:05:09,409
That looks good.

1031
01:05:09,493 --> 01:05:12,371
Which way to Alchemax? Oh!

1032
01:05:12,454 --> 01:05:14,164
It's a place with a big collider--

1033
01:05:15,249 --> 01:05:18,126
- Hey, cow guy! "Moo-ve" over!
- That's the best you could do?

1034
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:20,796
- Gwen! I'm here to help!
- Miles, are you--?

1035
01:05:20,879 --> 01:05:24,091
Whoopsie-daisy.
You weren't expecting that, were you?

1036
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:27,010
- Oh, no!
- Neither was I. I'm in the zone!

1037
01:05:29,096 --> 01:05:31,557
- I got you!
- Did you follow me?

1038
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:35,519
No, I just saw where you went
and went there without you knowing.

1039
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:38,814
-You're not supposed to be here!
-What are you talking about? I'm helping--

1040
01:05:40,524 --> 01:05:43,110
No! No, no, no!

1041
01:05:46,238 --> 01:05:47,447
Whoa!

1042
01:05:47,948 --> 01:05:49,491
I shouldn't have ever come to see you.

1043
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,034
Dang.

1044
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:01,420
Hey, who's the new guy?

1045
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:04,381
Hey, Pav.
He's Miles and he wasn't invited.

1046
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:07,050
Oh!
You weren't invited and you came anyway?

1047
01:06:07,134 --> 01:06:09,720
-Right?
-New guy must be in love with you.

1048
01:06:09,803 --> 01:06:10,846
- Okay, whoa.
- No.

1049
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:13,015
-I'm not.
-I'm very good at reading people.

1050
01:06:13,098 --> 01:06:14,474
- He's not.
- Who are you?

1051
01:06:14,558 --> 01:06:16,185
- Glad you asked, new guy.
- I'm not a new guy.

1052
01:06:16,268 --> 01:06:19,771
{\an8}<i>My name is Pavitr Prabhakar,
and for the past six months--</i>

1053
01:06:19,855 --> 01:06:21,815
Six? And even he got a watch?

1054
01:06:21,899 --> 01:06:24,818
-Yeah, uh...
<i>-Being Spider-Man is so easy.</i>

1055
01:06:24,902 --> 01:06:26,111
<i>I wake up, skip the workout,</i>

1056
01:06:26,195 --> 01:06:28,864
<i>because I'm naturally buff
and I don't wanna get too big.</i>

1057
01:06:28,947 --> 01:06:30,616
<i>Do almost nothing with my amazing hair.</i>

1058
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:32,117
You don't use any product at all?

1059
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:33,911
Just coconut oil, prayer, some genetics.

1060
01:06:33,994 --> 01:06:36,747
<i>Then I swing by school.
Don't really have to try, but I do anyway.</i>

1061
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:38,665
<i>Fight a few bad guys,
feed a few street dogs,</i>

1062
01:06:38,749 --> 01:06:40,959
<i>quick break for a cup of chai
with my Maya Auntie--</i>

1063
01:06:41,043 --> 01:06:43,504
-I love chai tea.
-What did you just say?

1064
01:06:43,587 --> 01:06:44,546
"Chai tea"?

1065
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:47,758
"Chai" means "tea," bro.
You're saying "tea" tea.

1066
01:06:47,841 --> 01:06:50,302
Would I ask you for a "coffee" coffee
with "cream" cream?

1067
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:51,220
I'm so sorry.

1068
01:06:51,303 --> 01:06:54,181
<i>Then I hang out
with my girlfriend, Gayatri.</i>

1069
01:06:54,264 --> 01:06:56,558
<i>She's an extremely classy teenager.</i>

1070
01:06:56,642 --> 01:06:58,852
Hey, girl. Tonight, I was thinking--

1071
01:06:58,936 --> 01:07:01,063
Hello, Police Inspector Singh.

1072
01:07:01,146 --> 01:07:03,148
This is your daughter. I do not know her.

1073
01:07:03,232 --> 01:07:07,319
To top it off, I live in the best possible
Spider-Man city, Mumbattan.

1074
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:10,447
Quick tour. This is where the traffic is,
this is where the traffic is.

1075
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:13,951
Traffic here too. This is where
the British stole all of our stuff. Whoa!

1076
01:07:16,828 --> 01:07:18,121
- Hello, Spider-Man.
- Hi.

1077
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:19,623
- Hey.
- Not you.

1078
01:07:19,706 --> 01:07:21,083
You talking to him or me or him?

1079
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:22,876
- Think he means me.
- Yeah. Him.

1080
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,628
I got this, guys.

1081
01:07:24,711 --> 01:07:26,255
-Huh?
-Wow. How are you?

1082
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:29,758
Can you tell I levelled up my game?

1083
01:07:29,842 --> 01:07:32,219
I'm on a journey of self-improvement.

1084
01:07:32,302 --> 01:07:33,971
And you came to India.

1085
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:37,474
That's a Western culture cliché.
Don't <i>Eat, Pray, Love </i>me, bro.

1086
01:07:37,558 --> 01:07:38,892
I did not mean it like that.

1087
01:07:38,976 --> 01:07:41,520
Let me guess, you're gonna ask me
about saffron and cardamom

1088
01:07:41,603 --> 01:07:44,064
and naan bread,
which is the same as saying "bread" bread,

1089
01:07:44,147 --> 01:07:45,816
which is the same as saying "chai tea."

1090
01:07:45,899 --> 01:07:47,860
- Oh, I love chai tea.
- No!

1091
01:07:49,278 --> 01:07:52,781
Come on, man! I think maybe
we got off on the wrong foot.

1092
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:54,074
Let's just talk about this.

1093
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:57,744
Fine. You made me feel empty,
like I had a hole inside of me.

1094
01:07:57,828 --> 01:07:58,954
We all have holes.

1095
01:07:59,788 --> 01:08:02,749
But now I found out
what to fill that hole up with.

1096
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:04,168
More holes!

1097
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:06,003
That doesn't make any sense!

1098
01:08:06,086 --> 01:08:07,045
It will.

1099
01:08:07,713 --> 01:08:09,131
I'm okay. I'm good.

1100
01:08:09,214 --> 01:08:10,632
- Don't worry.
- We won't.

1101
01:08:10,716 --> 01:08:12,718
This romantic tension is so palpable.

1102
01:08:12,801 --> 01:08:14,178
If Spot gets more holes...

1103
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:16,470
- Will they, won't they?
- ...he'll be unstoppable!

1104
01:08:16,555 --> 01:08:18,307
- We can't let him get to--
- Alchemax?

1105
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:20,809
See? How can you guys even concentrate?

1106
01:08:22,394 --> 01:08:24,062
Hey, does he know about Hobie?

1107
01:08:24,145 --> 01:08:27,482
-What should I know about Hobie?
-Oh, looks like he did not know.

1108
01:08:29,984 --> 01:08:31,486
Boop.

1109
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:36,073
Go away. Go away.
See you later. Thanks for coming.

1110
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:39,703
Would you please deactivate
this strong barrier?

1111
01:08:39,786 --> 01:08:42,663
It can't be turned off
until the collider sequence is complete.

1112
01:08:42,747 --> 01:08:45,042
The collider sequence? Oh, man.

1113
01:08:47,586 --> 01:08:50,171
- You need to stop!
- You don't know what you're doing!

1114
01:08:50,255 --> 01:08:53,175
I'm about to be so much more
than a villain of the week.

1115
01:08:53,258 --> 01:08:56,929
I'm sorry I called you that, okay?
You're a great villain.

1116
01:08:57,011 --> 01:08:58,388
Oh, not yet, I'm not.

1117
01:08:58,471 --> 01:09:01,350
- <i>Initialising collider.
</i>-No!

1118
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:07,939
<i>How's it going now?</i>

1119
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:10,274
Great. Anyone got any ideas?

1120
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:12,611
Oh, I have so many, but none for this.

1121
01:09:13,362 --> 01:09:16,281
Stand back.
I've been working on something new.

1122
01:09:28,377 --> 01:09:31,087
- How long does this usually take?
- Just give me a second.

1123
01:09:31,171 --> 01:09:33,631
Do you want us to do something,
or do we just stand here?

1124
01:09:33,715 --> 01:09:35,300
Are you charging it, or--?

1125
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:37,344
No. I'm absorbing it
so I can shoot it back.

1126
01:09:37,426 --> 01:09:39,638
- Looks like you're charging.
- Does this have a name?

1127
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:42,808
Hold your questions
until I'm done breaking this!

1128
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:44,142
Just let me do this!

1129
01:09:44,225 --> 01:09:45,310
Oi, oi!

1130
01:09:58,073 --> 01:10:00,200
- Hobie!
- Hobie, my guy!

1131
01:10:00,284 --> 01:10:01,827
- Hobie?
- Look at that, another one.

1132
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:04,413
I love how many different variations
of you guys there are.

1133
01:10:04,496 --> 01:10:08,125
-Man-like, Pav! Big stepper! Yeah, mate!
-What's this dude saying?

1134
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:11,336
It's English for "We get
along great, and we're close friends."

1135
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:12,921
Is this the younger from 1610?

1136
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:14,256
Do you understand this guy?

1137
01:10:14,339 --> 01:10:16,008
Hobie, thanks for breaking the shield!

1138
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:17,384
I loosened it.

1139
01:10:17,467 --> 01:10:20,470
Bit of advice.
Use the palm, not just your fingers.

1140
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:23,390
What's up with your suit?
Is he bleeding from his armpits?

1141
01:10:23,473 --> 01:10:24,641
Miles, Hobie. Hobie, Miles.

1142
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:27,978
Hi. I've never heard of you
because Gwen barely ever mentions you.

1143
01:10:28,061 --> 01:10:30,981
<i>A'ight, my name's Hobie, Hobie Brown.
I was bitten by a--</i>

1144
01:10:31,064 --> 01:10:32,733
<i>Wouldn't you like to know?
You know what I mean?</i>

1145
01:10:32,816 --> 01:10:36,278
<i>For the last three years, I've been
the one and only-- Wait, wait, wait.</i>

1146
01:10:36,361 --> 01:10:38,488
<i>You think I'm gonna show you
my secret identity? Come out of it.</i>

1147
01:10:38,572 --> 01:10:42,117
<i>That is, when I'm not playing shows,
antagonizing fascists,</i>

1148
01:10:42,201 --> 01:10:44,995
<i>staging unpermitted political actions
slash performance-art pieces,</i>

1149
01:10:45,078 --> 01:10:47,289
<i>or having a laugh at the pub
with the mandem.</i>

1150
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:49,541
<i>I'm not a role model.
I was briefly a runway model.</i>

1151
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:52,461
<i>I hate the a.m. I hate the PM.
I hate labels.</i>

1152
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:54,588
<i>I'm not a hero
because calling yourself a hero</i>

1153
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:57,549
<i>makes you a self-mythologizing,
narcissistic autocrat.</i>

1154
01:10:57,633 --> 01:10:59,259
Come on! I thought you hated labels.

1155
01:10:59,343 --> 01:11:01,345
Gwendy, you left your jumper
around my place.

1156
01:11:01,428 --> 01:11:03,388
- What's a jumper?
- It's a sweater.

1157
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:06,308
-How many sweaters do you have?
-That's not mine, I'm sure.

1158
01:11:06,391 --> 01:11:08,602
- And your toothbrush.
- Wait, what?

1159
01:11:08,685 --> 01:11:10,604
Are those my Chucks?

1160
01:11:12,898 --> 01:11:15,526
- Y'all make a heck of a team.
- I don't believe in teams.

1161
01:11:15,609 --> 01:11:16,652
Aren't you in a band?

1162
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,111
I don't believe in consistency.

1163
01:11:18,862 --> 01:11:20,030
This guy's killing me.

1164
01:11:22,157 --> 01:11:23,659
This is gonna be good for us, Spider-Man.

1165
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:28,038
You and me, we're finally
gonna live up to our potential.

1166
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:30,707
You'll finally have
a villain worth fighting.

1167
01:11:30,791 --> 01:11:32,709
And I won't be just a joke to you!

1168
01:11:42,636 --> 01:11:43,762
You're not a joke!

1169
01:11:43,846 --> 01:11:44,930
- Right, gang?
- Absolutely.

1170
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:47,057
- Completely unamusing!
- I don't believe in comedy!

1171
01:11:47,766 --> 01:11:48,767
Just kidding!

1172
01:11:48,851 --> 01:11:51,186
See? No one here thinks you're a joke!

1173
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:53,772
- They won't after this.
- No!

1174
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:01,905
Wow. That was another easy adventure
for Spider-Man.

1175
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:03,824
- No, no, no!
- No, no, no!

1176
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:23,594
I'm coming!

1177
01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:33,770
What was that?

1178
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:37,941
Our future.

1179
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:44,406
I'm gonna take everything from you,
like you took everything from me.

1180
01:12:46,617 --> 01:12:47,618
What?

1181
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:51,205
See you back home, Spider-Man.

1182
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,919
Miles. Miles!

1183
01:12:57,002 --> 01:12:58,462
You okay? We gotta go.

1184
01:12:58,545 --> 01:13:01,173
Oi, oi, liven up, mate.
No time to get dizzy.

1185
01:13:05,427 --> 01:13:07,221
Everyone, <i>chalo, chalo!</i>

1186
01:13:20,567 --> 01:13:23,820
We'll clear the path.
You slow down that building.

1187
01:13:23,904 --> 01:13:25,989
I'll do it.
But not because you told me to.

1188
01:13:34,206 --> 01:13:35,332
Everybody, run!

1189
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:53,767
Watch out!

1190
01:14:30,512 --> 01:14:31,889
{\an8}Gayatri!

1191
01:14:32,472 --> 01:14:34,308
Gayatri! No!

1192
01:14:43,984 --> 01:14:44,985
<i>Gwen, heads up.</i>

1193
01:14:45,068 --> 01:14:47,029
<i>Markers are predicting
an incoming canon event.</i>

1194
01:14:47,112 --> 01:14:48,322
<i>So tread carefully.</i>

1195
01:14:49,114 --> 01:14:49,948
I'm on it.

1196
01:14:51,742 --> 01:14:53,202
Somebody, help!

1197
01:14:53,285 --> 01:14:55,120
- Hurry, everyone! This way, quickly!
- Help!

1198
01:15:01,627 --> 01:15:03,045
Inspector Singh!

1199
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,135
I can do both!

1200
01:15:13,972 --> 01:15:16,183
- I got him, I got him!
- Miles!

1201
01:15:16,266 --> 01:15:18,519
Don't worry.
Thread the needle, ring the bell, right?

1202
01:15:18,602 --> 01:15:21,021
-It's too dangerous.
-I'll be okay, I promise.

1203
01:15:21,104 --> 01:15:22,314
Miles!

1204
01:15:33,534 --> 01:15:34,618
Miles!

1205
01:15:38,455 --> 01:15:39,498
No! No.

1206
01:15:51,677 --> 01:15:52,886
You're all right.

1207
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:54,304
I promised.

1208
01:16:00,978 --> 01:16:03,021
Are you okay? I was so worried.

1209
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:06,942
I mean, you seem like a nice young woman
that I do not know.

1210
01:16:08,068 --> 01:16:09,444
Gayatri!

1211
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:15,367
Not bad, right?

1212
01:16:19,288 --> 01:16:20,122
Right.

1213
01:16:22,124 --> 01:16:24,168
I've never seen him so emotional.

1214
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:25,419
Excellent job.

1215
01:16:36,305 --> 01:16:40,142
Man-like, Miles! My guy!

1216
01:16:43,061 --> 01:16:44,062
Easy.

1217
01:16:51,862 --> 01:16:53,363
So, what do you think?

1218
01:16:54,656 --> 01:16:55,949
What I always think.

1219
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:57,951
You're amazing.

1220
01:16:59,536 --> 01:17:02,873
We make a good team. Yeah?

1221
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:04,875
Yeah.

1222
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:12,925
Guys, what's that?

1223
01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:15,886
It's a metaphor for capitalism.

1224
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:19,431
It's a lot worse than that.

1225
01:17:26,605 --> 01:17:28,774
Okay, guys, secure the area,
clear all civilians,

1226
01:17:28,857 --> 01:17:30,984
and let's contain this quantum hole.

1227
01:17:31,068 --> 01:17:33,946
Hey, I'm Miles.
We met before, when I was invisible.

1228
01:17:34,029 --> 01:17:35,405
I know who you are.

1229
01:17:39,034 --> 01:17:40,869
Is everything going to be okay?

1230
01:17:49,503 --> 01:17:51,046
Okay, let me explain.

1231
01:17:51,129 --> 01:17:52,881
Miguel wants you back at HQ.

1232
01:17:52,965 --> 01:17:55,175
-Miles was just about to head out.
-All of you.

1233
01:17:55,259 --> 01:17:59,847
-I don't follow orders, neither does he.
-I'm invited to HQ? Whoo!

1234
01:18:14,111 --> 01:18:16,655
How are you even cooler under your mask?

1235
01:18:16,738 --> 01:18:18,323
I was this cool the whole time.

1236
01:18:34,756 --> 01:18:36,383
Hey, over here.

1237
01:18:42,556 --> 01:18:44,725
Yo, this place is wild.

1238
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:47,144
- Any sign of Spot?
- Let me ask.

1239
01:18:47,227 --> 01:18:48,645
Anybody spot Spot?

1240
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:51,648
-Oh, so funny. Anybody else got jokes?
-Now that you mention it.

1241
01:18:51,732 --> 01:18:54,943
Well, you know what they say,
we need to run a spot check.

1242
01:18:55,027 --> 01:18:58,071
This is unbelievable.

1243
01:18:58,155 --> 01:19:00,199
-This is the lobby.
-Oh.

1244
01:19:00,782 --> 01:19:03,911
Welcome to Spider-Society.

1245
01:19:13,378 --> 01:19:14,922
It's a bit much, innit?

1246
01:19:15,005 --> 01:19:17,549
What happened to that small,
elite strike team?

1247
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:19,343
A lot of these are part-time.

1248
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:24,723
Gwendy, how much have you told him, hm?
About his place in all this?

1249
01:19:24,806 --> 01:19:25,641
A little.

1250
01:19:27,559 --> 01:19:29,436
-Maybe not enough.
-Here.

1251
01:19:30,729 --> 01:19:31,813
My own watch!

1252
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:34,650
It's a day pass.
This just keeps you from...

1253
01:19:35,901 --> 01:19:36,902
...doing that.

1254
01:19:38,695 --> 01:19:40,656
- Hey, Gwen.
- Hey, Peter.

1255
01:19:40,739 --> 01:19:41,823
Hey, I'm Miles.

1256
01:19:41,907 --> 01:19:43,575
- Hey, Gwen.
- Hey, Peters.

1257
01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:44,660
I'm a new recruit.

1258
01:19:44,743 --> 01:19:48,497
{\an8}Peter, take a team to the transport deck
to help deal with this Spot mess.

1259
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:51,208
{\an8}--I wouldn't call it a mess.

1260
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:53,502
-More like a success in progress.
-Ben, I need--

1261
01:19:53,585 --> 01:19:57,422
Sorry, I can't talk right now.
I'm thinking about my past.

1262
01:19:57,506 --> 01:19:59,299
Actually, we need you here
for some reason.

1263
01:19:59,383 --> 01:20:02,928
That was a particularly harrowing memory.

1264
01:20:03,011 --> 01:20:04,096
Is he okay?

1265
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:06,849
{\an8}-Ah!
-Howdy. Name's Web-Slinger.

1266
01:20:06,932 --> 01:20:10,561
- Why does the horse need a mask?
- To conceal her face.

1267
01:20:10,644 --> 01:20:12,437
Giddy up!

1268
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:15,148
Who is in these laser cages?

1269
01:20:15,232 --> 01:20:17,234
<i>Anomalies. Folks who wound up
in the wrong dimension.</i>

1270
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:19,111
We kick their butts and send them home.

1271
01:20:19,194 --> 01:20:20,571
They're not very interesting.

1272
01:20:20,654 --> 01:20:22,739
<i>-We got a bunch of Doc Ocks.
</i>-That's interesting.

1273
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:25,409
<i>A Moosterio. Ms Sterio.</i>

1274
01:20:25,492 --> 01:20:27,286
<i>- Video game guy.
- </i>-I love video games!

1275
01:20:27,369 --> 01:20:29,705
<i>-Another video game guy.
</i>-Are you talking to me?

1276
01:20:29,788 --> 01:20:30,914
<i>Typeface.</i>

1277
01:20:30,998 --> 01:20:33,709
-Go to Helvetica, Spider-Man!
-Bold.

1278
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:36,503
<i>An interesting Kraven, a boring Rhino.</i>

1279
01:20:36,587 --> 01:20:37,629
<i>A Prowler.</i>

1280
01:20:37,713 --> 01:20:39,548
- Prowler?
- Not your Prowler.

1281
01:20:40,841 --> 01:20:41,675
Hey.

1282
01:20:42,885 --> 01:20:43,719
Hey.

1283
01:20:46,805 --> 01:20:49,433
-It's rude to stare.
-Caught that one myself.

1284
01:20:49,516 --> 01:20:51,393
-I slipped.
-You? I did all the work.

1285
01:20:51,476 --> 01:20:53,312
How many missions
have you been on together?

1286
01:20:53,395 --> 01:20:55,105
-Not that many.
-Couple dozen.

1287
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:56,899
{\an8}That's cool. Sorry.

1288
01:20:59,443 --> 01:21:02,571
{\an8}-I'm Spider-Man.
-Oh, no way! All of us are.

1289
01:21:02,654 --> 01:21:05,574
-Can we just keep moving?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you?

1290
01:21:05,657 --> 01:21:07,284
I'm an avatar.

1291
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:09,286
My body is back in my parents' dimension,

1292
01:21:09,369 --> 01:21:11,622
chilling in a gaming chair
and eating Fritos.

1293
01:21:11,705 --> 01:21:13,707
<i>Right, because you don't listen.</i>

1294
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:15,250
Here is better.

1295
01:21:15,334 --> 01:21:16,335
I hear that.

1296
01:21:18,879 --> 01:21:19,963
What does that do?

1297
01:21:20,047 --> 01:21:21,381
Apart from having a great name?

1298
01:21:21,465 --> 01:21:23,759
-The Go Home Machine.
-What'd I say, eh?

1299
01:21:23,842 --> 01:21:24,843
I voted against it.

1300
01:21:24,927 --> 01:21:27,846
It detects whatever dimension
your DNA is from

1301
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:29,181
and sends you there.

1302
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:31,725
It's super humane and not creepy.

1303
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:35,187
See you, dawg. Don't come back.

1304
01:21:37,064 --> 01:21:39,566
We should go.
We don't wanna keep the boss waiting.

1305
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:40,776
-See you around?
-Let's go!

1306
01:21:40,859 --> 01:21:43,070
-Good luck out there, man.
-Okay, bye!

1307
01:21:43,153 --> 01:21:44,404
<i>Miguel sounds hangry.</i>

1308
01:21:44,488 --> 01:21:46,823
He likes those empanadas
from the cafeteria.

1309
01:21:46,907 --> 01:21:47,950
<i>Don't ask me why.</i>

1310
01:21:49,701 --> 01:21:51,495
<i>My name is Miguel O'Hara.</i>

1311
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:56,458
<i>I'm this dimension's one
and only Spider-Man.</i>

1312
01:21:58,669 --> 01:21:59,920
<i>At least, I was.</i>

1313
01:22:03,465 --> 01:22:05,217
<i>But I'm not like the others.</i>

1314
01:22:07,594 --> 01:22:10,097
<i>I don't always like what I have to do.</i>

1315
01:22:11,098 --> 01:22:13,517
<i>But I know I have to be the one to do it.</i>

1316
01:22:14,726 --> 01:22:17,521
<i>I've given up too much to stop now.</i>

1317
01:22:20,023 --> 01:22:21,066
Whoa, yo.

1318
01:22:22,609 --> 01:22:24,069
Bet this doesn't even do anything.

1319
01:22:24,152 --> 01:22:26,613
Maybe it did
before you ripped it out of a wall.

1320
01:22:26,697 --> 01:22:29,867
It's propaganda, bruv.
To distract you from the truth.

1321
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:31,660
And what's that?

1322
01:22:31,743 --> 01:22:34,538
{\an8}I ain't got a Scooby Doo.
That's what they want.

1323
01:22:39,376 --> 01:22:42,379
<i>- Why you wanna be part of this lot?
- </i>-<i> To get a watch.</i>

1324
01:22:42,462 --> 01:22:44,715
-Make your own watch.
-Pssh.

1325
01:22:44,798 --> 01:22:47,301
Bet you got a nice setup, eh?
Nice parents.

1326
01:22:47,384 --> 01:22:50,470
They're fine.
I mean, we got in a fight, but...

1327
01:22:51,471 --> 01:22:53,891
They just want what's best for me, so...

1328
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:56,476
-That's a bloody shame.
-Why?

1329
01:22:57,436 --> 01:22:59,396
'Cause you're not ready
for everybody else.

1330
01:23:01,064 --> 01:23:03,567
- <i>We did it this time!
- </i>-<i> Okay, okay, </i>mija.

1331
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:09,615
<i>Good job.</i>

1332
01:23:11,825 --> 01:23:15,787
<i>Listen to me, bruv. Whole point
of being Spider-Man is your independence.</i>

1333
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:17,706
Being your own boss.
You don't need all this.

1334
01:23:17,789 --> 01:23:21,084
-Then why are you here?
-Looking out for my drummer, is all.

1335
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:22,878
I want to be in a band. I--

1336
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:26,507
I wanna see my friends,
and I need a watch to do that.

1337
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:27,925
Guys, come on.

1338
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:29,510
All right. Squashed.

1339
01:23:31,011 --> 01:23:33,263
Don't enlist till you know
what war you're fighting.

1340
01:23:56,703 --> 01:23:58,080
Yeah, I know it's slow.

1341
01:23:58,622 --> 01:23:59,998
But it's his thing.

1342
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:04,753
Miguel O'Hara, meet Miles Morales.

1343
01:24:04,837 --> 01:24:07,130
Hey!

1344
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:08,507
I speak Spanish.

1345
01:24:17,766 --> 01:24:20,310
- I'm excited to get going.
- Oh. Great.

1346
01:24:20,394 --> 01:24:22,563
-I have new ideas on how to catch Spot.
-Oh. Wow. Uh-huh.

1347
01:24:22,646 --> 01:24:25,482
He just wants to be
taken seriously, like we all do. Whoa!

1348
01:24:25,774 --> 01:24:27,192
He's worried about Spot.

1349
01:24:27,276 --> 01:24:28,610
I'll worry about Spot!

1350
01:24:28,694 --> 01:24:31,613
-What did I do?
-Miguel! It's not his fault.

1351
01:24:31,697 --> 01:24:34,199
-Fault? Hold up.
-You blew another hole in the multiverse!

1352
01:24:34,283 --> 01:24:37,744
-He doesn't know any better.
-I do know what-- Not know what?

1353
01:24:37,828 --> 01:24:39,329
But you did, Gwen.

1354
01:24:40,038 --> 01:24:42,958
And you--
I'm just gonna try to ignore you.

1355
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:45,002
-I just can't. I can't even.
-I ain't even here.

1356
01:24:45,836 --> 01:24:46,879
Or here.

1357
01:24:46,962 --> 01:24:49,464
- What's happening?
- Hey, Miguel!

1358
01:24:49,548 --> 01:24:52,092
Come on, go easy on the kid.

1359
01:24:52,176 --> 01:24:55,554
He had a terrible teacher.

1360
01:24:55,637 --> 01:24:57,055
He had no chance.

1361
01:24:57,139 --> 01:24:58,891
-Peter!
-Oh, boy.

1362
01:24:58,974 --> 01:25:01,435
Humbling-Reality Spider-Man has arrived.

1363
01:25:01,518 --> 01:25:02,936
-Miles!
-Dude!

1364
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:06,732
Don't be afraid of my friend Miguel.
He just looks scary. He's got no bite.

1365
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:09,193
- Peter.
- You're growing up on me. You look great.

1366
01:25:09,276 --> 01:25:12,905
-You look solid, you know. You look good.
-Define "solid."

1367
01:25:12,988 --> 01:25:14,948
What happened?
You bleeding from the armpits?

1368
01:25:15,032 --> 01:25:17,618
-Peter, you--
-Don't worry, we'll get you a new suit.

1369
01:25:17,701 --> 01:25:19,369
Peter, you gotta tell them--

1370
01:25:19,453 --> 01:25:21,872
- Wait. What is that?
- Mayday!

1371
01:25:21,955 --> 01:25:23,332
-You have a baby!
-I have a baby.

1372
01:25:23,415 --> 01:25:24,416
This is crazy.

1373
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:26,877
Don't forget to keep
your little day pass on, honey.

1374
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,671
Oh, you have one too.
I didn't know they made those for adults.

1375
01:25:29,755 --> 01:25:32,841
-Give me a second. Mayday!
-The kid's an anarchist.

1376
01:25:32,925 --> 01:25:35,427
I'm coming up to get you.
Here I come. Don't move.

1377
01:25:37,179 --> 01:25:40,599
I got you. I knew I was gonna regret
making her that web shooter.

1378
01:25:40,682 --> 01:25:42,684
I shouldn't have done it.
That's an actual mistake.

1379
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:45,646
-You wanna see pictures?
-She's right there.

1380
01:25:45,729 --> 01:25:48,065
-Look at this pic!
-Oh, you've got them.

1381
01:25:48,148 --> 01:25:49,525
-She's incredible.
-Yup.

1382
01:25:49,608 --> 01:25:52,361
This is her funny face.
That's her mad face.

1383
01:25:52,444 --> 01:25:54,238
This one is the studious one.

1384
01:25:54,321 --> 01:25:56,990
Watch out,
the next one you're gonna crack up.

1385
01:25:57,074 --> 01:26:00,035
Miguel's gonna die.
Miguel, look at this one.

1386
01:26:00,118 --> 01:26:02,120
I'm trying to hold
a serious adult conversation.

1387
01:26:02,204 --> 01:26:03,997
You're the only Spider-Man
who isn't funny.

1388
01:26:04,081 --> 01:26:06,542
-We're supposed to be funny.
-The fate of the multiverse--

1389
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:08,335
You always lose me with that.

1390
01:26:08,418 --> 01:26:12,589
You say, "The fate of the multiverse,"
and my brain dies.

1391
01:26:14,174 --> 01:26:15,843
Do you guys smell that?
Mayday took a crap.

1392
01:26:15,926 --> 01:26:17,386
- Yup. She's a Parker.
- Miles.

1393
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:19,179
That's what happens
when a Parker eats an avocado.

1394
01:26:19,263 --> 01:26:21,306
-You disrupted a canon event.
-Canon event?

1395
01:26:21,390 --> 01:26:24,268
The kid wasn't thinking.
That's not how he works.

1396
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:25,394
That's insulting.

1397
01:26:25,477 --> 01:26:28,105
Taking a crap on the establishment.
I salute you.

1398
01:26:28,188 --> 01:26:30,649
Wait, what are you upset about?
I saved those people.

1399
01:26:30,732 --> 01:26:32,276
And that's the problem.

1400
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:37,197
-LYLA, do the thing.
<i>-Huh? What thing?</i>

1401
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:40,117
What do you mean, "What thing?"
The information-explainy thing.

1402
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,201
<i>Okay.</i>

1403
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:48,917
What's this?

1404
01:26:49,793 --> 01:26:52,379
This is everything.

1405
01:26:57,801 --> 01:26:59,803
Can you be more specific?

1406
01:26:59,887 --> 01:27:02,139
Can you not talk for a second?

1407
01:27:02,222 --> 01:27:03,307
Yeah, yeah, I--

1408
01:27:04,266 --> 01:27:05,309
And this here?

1409
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,811
This is all of us.

1410
01:27:08,645 --> 01:27:11,690
All of our lives woven together

1411
01:27:11,773 --> 01:27:14,776
in a beautiful web of life and destiny.

1412
01:27:15,819 --> 01:27:17,154
The Spider-Verse.

1413
01:27:17,237 --> 01:27:18,280
Spider-Verse.

1414
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:20,908
That's stupid.

1415
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:24,411
It's called
the Arachnohumanoid Polymultiverse.

1416
01:27:25,329 --> 01:27:28,373
Which sounds stupid too, I guess.

1417
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:32,127
And these nodes where the lines converge?

1418
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,338
They are the canon.

1419
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:39,051
Chapters that are a part
of every Spider's story every time.

1420
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:41,053
Some good.

1421
01:27:42,596 --> 01:27:43,805
Some bad.

1422
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:47,017
Some very bad.

1423
01:27:55,317 --> 01:27:56,610
Just keep going.

1424
01:27:56,693 --> 01:27:58,153
Uncle Aaron.

1425
01:27:59,029 --> 01:28:01,990
This one, Event ASM-90.

1426
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:05,369
A police captain close to Spider-Man dies,

1427
01:28:05,452 --> 01:28:09,706
saving a kid from falling rubble
during a battle with an archnemesis.

1428
01:28:10,332 --> 01:28:11,500
Captain Stacy.

1429
01:28:12,584 --> 01:28:13,877
I'm so sorry.

1430
01:28:24,847 --> 01:28:25,681
No.

1431
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:38,652
That happened to you?

1432
01:28:40,654 --> 01:28:42,114
And me.

1433
01:28:45,909 --> 01:28:47,661
Ey. What of it?

1434
01:28:48,287 --> 01:28:50,664
That's how the story is supposed to go.

1435
01:28:51,623 --> 01:28:56,044
Canon events are the connections
that bind our lives together.

1436
01:28:56,795 --> 01:28:59,339
But those connections can be broken.

1437
01:29:00,674 --> 01:29:05,095
That's why anomalies are so dangerous.

1438
01:29:06,263 --> 01:29:08,891
Inspector Singh's death was a canon event.

1439
01:29:08,974 --> 01:29:10,934
You weren't supposed to be there.

1440
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:13,478
And you weren't supposed to save him.

1441
01:29:14,062 --> 01:29:16,940
- That's why Gwen tried to stop you.
- Miles!

1442
01:29:17,024 --> 01:29:19,234
I thought you were trying to save me.

1443
01:29:20,903 --> 01:29:22,404
I was. I...

1444
01:29:23,822 --> 01:29:25,324
I was doing both.

1445
01:29:25,949 --> 01:29:30,412
And now, Miles,
because you changed the story,

1446
01:29:30,495 --> 01:29:33,165
Pavitr's dimension is unravelling.

1447
01:29:33,874 --> 01:29:36,502
If we're lucky, we can stop it.

1448
01:29:38,086 --> 01:29:39,796
We haven't always been lucky.

1449
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:42,049
That wasn't me. That was the Spot.

1450
01:29:42,132 --> 01:29:44,801
It's what happens
when you break the canon.

1451
01:29:47,221 --> 01:29:48,305
How do you know?

1452
01:29:49,181 --> 01:29:51,391
Because I broke it once myself.

1453
01:29:52,309 --> 01:29:55,854
I found a world where I had a family.

1454
01:29:55,938 --> 01:29:57,314
<i>Where I was happy.</i>

1455
01:29:58,273 --> 01:30:00,192
<i>At least, a version of me was.</i>

1456
01:30:01,652 --> 01:30:04,446
{\an8}<i>And that version of myself was killed.</i>

1457
01:30:09,701 --> 01:30:10,994
<i>So I replaced him.</i>

1458
01:30:14,498 --> 01:30:16,416
<i>I thought it was harmless.</i>

1459
01:30:19,545 --> 01:30:20,963
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

1460
01:30:30,013 --> 01:30:31,849
Daddy? Dad.

1461
01:30:31,932 --> 01:30:33,100
Daddy, no!

1462
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:39,648
<i>Isn't that right, Peter?</i>

1463
01:30:40,691 --> 01:30:41,525
Yeah.

1464
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:45,362
You break enough canon,
save enough captains...

1465
01:30:47,489 --> 01:30:49,700
and we could lose everything.

1466
01:31:01,753 --> 01:31:03,922
My dad is about to be captain.

1467
01:31:13,223 --> 01:31:14,433
No.

1468
01:31:16,685 --> 01:31:18,896
<i>I'm gonna take everything from you...</i>

1469
01:31:20,814 --> 01:31:23,233
<i>- like you took everything from me.
- </i>-I'm coming!

1470
01:31:27,946 --> 01:31:29,156
Spot does it.

1471
01:31:31,074 --> 01:31:32,284
He kills him.

1472
01:31:38,707 --> 01:31:41,043
When does it happen?

1473
01:31:44,379 --> 01:31:46,632
-When does it happen?
-In two days.

1474
01:31:47,799 --> 01:31:49,051
When he's sworn in.

1475
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:52,179
<i>That's what the model says.</i>

1476
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:55,516
I'm sorry, Miles.

1477
01:31:55,599 --> 01:31:56,767
Send me home.

1478
01:31:57,351 --> 01:31:59,394
I can't do that. Not now.

1479
01:32:00,062 --> 01:32:02,689
What am I supposed to do?
Just let him die?

1480
01:32:06,944 --> 01:32:08,403
What about your dad?

1481
01:32:08,487 --> 01:32:10,072
He's a captain, right?

1482
01:32:12,407 --> 01:32:13,242
Yeah.

1483
01:32:13,825 --> 01:32:15,202
And that's it?

1484
01:32:15,285 --> 01:32:16,787
You aren't gonna do anything about it?

1485
01:32:19,831 --> 01:32:21,583
Okay, what about Uncle Ben?

1486
01:32:21,667 --> 01:32:25,754
That have been okay if you knew
and you just let it play out?

1487
01:32:26,463 --> 01:32:28,799
If not for Uncle Ben,

1488
01:32:28,882 --> 01:32:31,552
most of us wouldn't be here, Miles.

1489
01:32:32,511 --> 01:32:35,013
And all the good we did, it...

1490
01:32:35,097 --> 01:32:36,849
It wouldn't have been done.

1491
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:42,437
So we're just supposed to let people die

1492
01:32:42,521 --> 01:32:45,858
because some algorithm says that
that's supposed to happen?

1493
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:49,069
You realise how messed up
that sounds, right?

1494
01:32:49,152 --> 01:32:51,905
You have a choice
between saving one person

1495
01:32:51,989 --> 01:32:53,824
and saving an entire world.

1496
01:32:53,907 --> 01:32:54,950
Every world.

1497
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:57,411
I can do both. Spider-Man always--

1498
01:32:57,494 --> 01:32:58,745
Not always.

1499
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:05,377
Miles, we all want to live the life
we wish we had.

1500
01:33:06,044 --> 01:33:08,505
Believe me, I have tried.

1501
01:33:08,589 --> 01:33:12,551
And the harder I tried,
the more damage I did.

1502
01:33:14,052 --> 01:33:15,888
You can't have it all, kid.

1503
01:33:20,058 --> 01:33:22,519
Being Spider-Man is a sacrifice.

1504
01:33:23,103 --> 01:33:24,354
That's the job.

1505
01:33:24,438 --> 01:33:26,148
That's what you signed up for.

1506
01:33:27,274 --> 01:33:28,275
Miles.

1507
01:33:30,903 --> 01:33:31,945
Peni?

1508
01:33:33,113 --> 01:33:34,114
What is this?

1509
01:33:35,908 --> 01:33:37,743
Is this is an intervention or something?

1510
01:33:38,619 --> 01:33:39,745
We know it's hard.

1511
01:33:40,996 --> 01:33:42,456
But it's the truth, Miles.

1512
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:46,752
Is that why you're here?
To let me down easy?

1513
01:33:48,921 --> 01:33:51,298
It worked last time,
why not run it back, huh?

1514
01:33:51,381 --> 01:33:53,383
-Hey, hold on. Hold on.
-You were right, Gwen.

1515
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:56,803
-You should've never come to see me.
-Kid, look at--

1516
01:33:56,887 --> 01:33:58,222
Stop calling me that.

1517
01:33:58,305 --> 01:33:59,598
-There we go.
-Hobie, not helping.

1518
01:33:59,681 --> 01:34:02,059
-Good.
-Miles, please understand.

1519
01:34:02,142 --> 01:34:04,645
You can't ask me not to save my father.

1520
01:34:04,728 --> 01:34:05,729
I'm not asking.

1521
01:34:06,522 --> 01:34:08,190
Just give him a second, please.

1522
01:34:08,273 --> 01:34:11,276
-This is a great look.
-Don't! Stop it!

1523
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:14,196
If we let him leave, he'll only do
more damage. We both know that.

1524
01:34:14,279 --> 01:34:16,406
Little man. Peter Pan. Palms.

1525
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:19,701
Just need to hold you a few days.
Sorry it had to end like this, kid.

1526
01:34:19,785 --> 01:34:23,038
I said not to call me that!

1527
01:34:33,632 --> 01:34:35,884
Miles!

1528
01:34:36,969 --> 01:34:37,970
All right.

1529
01:34:38,053 --> 01:34:40,848
I'm sorry for doing this.
This is bad parenting.

1530
01:34:42,015 --> 01:34:43,684
Just for the record, I quit.

1531
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:48,355
- Huh?
- Uh...

1532
01:34:48,438 --> 01:34:49,606
<i>All stations,</i>

1533
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:51,942
<i>drop what you're doing
and stop Spider-Man.</i>

1534
01:34:52,985 --> 01:34:54,361
-You?
-You?

1535
01:34:54,444 --> 01:34:55,863
-Me?
-Me?

1536
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:59,908
<i>Miles! Miles Morales!
He's entering Sector 4!</i>

1537
01:35:03,912 --> 01:35:06,498
-Is that him?
-Do I, uh, have web on my face?

1538
01:35:06,582 --> 01:35:07,416
What's the deal?

1539
01:35:07,499 --> 01:35:09,376
Miles! He's right there. He's right in--

1540
01:35:09,459 --> 01:35:12,087
-Turn around!
-I don't see anything, boss.

1541
01:35:30,564 --> 01:35:32,733
Can this day get any damn weirder?

1542
01:35:35,194 --> 01:35:36,945
Wow! I guess it can.

1543
01:35:43,702 --> 01:35:45,287
-Whoa!
-Sorry!

1544
01:35:50,167 --> 01:35:52,252
And then I looked at my uncle, and...

1545
01:35:52,336 --> 01:35:54,421
Uh, let me guess. He died?

1546
01:36:04,389 --> 01:36:05,432
Whoa!

1547
01:36:07,017 --> 01:36:08,602
On the count of three, draw.

1548
01:36:08,685 --> 01:36:10,687
One-- You didn't wait for three!

1549
01:36:10,771 --> 01:36:12,105
Hey, Miguel!

1550
01:36:12,189 --> 01:36:14,233
Can you take a photo of this?
It's her first chase.

1551
01:36:18,862 --> 01:36:19,947
Boo.

1552
01:36:22,866 --> 01:36:24,785
- Miles?
- Hi.

1553
01:36:24,868 --> 01:36:27,287
-I'm a huge fan of your work.
-Thanks.

1554
01:36:27,371 --> 01:36:30,082
Do you think Spider-People too often use
comedy as a crutch?

1555
01:36:30,165 --> 01:36:32,835
-Uh...
-Get it? "Crutch"?

1556
01:36:32,918 --> 01:36:34,837
I can do anything he can.

1557
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,713
Oh, dang, I pulled something.

1558
01:36:45,138 --> 01:36:46,849
- <i>Hello, Peter.

1559
01:36:51,228 --> 01:36:52,104
Meow!

1560
01:37:03,073 --> 01:37:04,157
There's nowhere to run.

1561
01:37:12,374 --> 01:37:14,793
My bad, everybody.
There was somewhere to run.

1562
01:37:23,635 --> 01:37:26,805
- Stop running!
- Then stop chasing me!

1563
01:37:26,889 --> 01:37:28,849
You're so frustrating.

1564
01:37:28,932 --> 01:37:32,728
I know he's your friend,
but it's the only way.

1565
01:37:32,811 --> 01:37:35,272
-But my gut says--
-Then use your head.

1566
01:37:54,166 --> 01:37:56,960
I've got you trapped
in my well-defined musculature.

1567
01:37:57,044 --> 01:37:58,462
So don't even--

1568
01:38:18,732 --> 01:38:19,691
Miles.

1569
01:38:19,775 --> 01:38:22,528
-No, no. Let me go.
-It is crazy to run.

1570
01:38:22,611 --> 01:38:25,280
Running is the least crazy thing going on.

1571
01:38:25,364 --> 01:38:27,658
-Look, I feel bad.
-Good!

1572
01:38:27,741 --> 01:38:30,661
But this is just how stuff works.
You're not gonna win here.

1573
01:38:30,744 --> 01:38:33,372
Just wait, don't move.
Stop moving so fast.

1574
01:38:33,455 --> 01:38:34,456
No!

1575
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:36,875
-Do you wanna hold my baby?
-What?

1576
01:38:36,959 --> 01:38:39,086
Would you just give the baby one squeeze
and then we'll talk?

1577
01:38:39,169 --> 01:38:41,755
I think it's gonna change our vibe.
It's very rejuvenating.

1578
01:38:41,839 --> 01:38:43,215
I'm plenty juvenated.

1579
01:38:43,298 --> 01:38:46,802
You'll get more so when you go
chest-to-chest with this magical child.

1580
01:38:46,885 --> 01:38:49,221
You don't get to have
a heartfelt conversation with me.

1581
01:38:49,304 --> 01:38:51,431
Just hold the baby,
we'll see what happens!

1582
01:38:53,475 --> 01:38:55,727
You're the reason I had her, okay?

1583
01:38:57,062 --> 01:39:00,649
I thought that if I did
a decent job raising her,

1584
01:39:00,732 --> 01:39:04,403
then there was a chance
she was gonna turn out like you.

1585
01:39:04,486 --> 01:39:07,990
And that got me excited
because you are a wonderful person.

1586
01:39:08,073 --> 01:39:10,826
And I like being around you.

1587
01:39:12,035 --> 01:39:14,079
Then why didn't you come see me?

1588
01:39:14,872 --> 01:39:15,706
Bec--

1589
01:39:16,999 --> 01:39:18,166
I couldn't.

1590
01:39:19,042 --> 01:39:21,378
I wanted to be with you guys so badly.

1591
01:39:23,797 --> 01:39:26,008
But this thing
isn't what I thought it was.

1592
01:39:26,091 --> 01:39:29,761
Look, bad things are gonna happen.

1593
01:39:29,845 --> 01:39:32,306
It makes us who we are.

1594
01:39:33,307 --> 01:39:36,226
But good things happen too, you know?

1595
01:39:36,977 --> 01:39:38,812
Like you happened.

1596
01:39:40,522 --> 01:39:42,149
And she happened.

1597
01:39:42,941 --> 01:39:44,818
Hey, I don't...

1598
01:39:44,902 --> 01:39:48,780
And you are so bad at holding a baby.

1599
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:51,408
- <i>We got your location, Peter.
</i>-Wait, wait. No, no!

1600
01:39:51,491 --> 01:39:53,577
You do not have my location. Over.

1601
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:54,661
Send everyone.

1602
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:59,541
No, no, no, Miles, I didn't know.
I promise you.

1603
01:39:59,625 --> 01:40:01,418
Please, man, let's talk about this.

1604
01:40:01,502 --> 01:40:02,336
We did.

1605
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:05,964
Good talk.

1606
01:40:10,344 --> 01:40:11,261
Get him!

1607
01:40:24,107 --> 01:40:25,359
Miles!

1608
01:40:25,442 --> 01:40:28,278
- Where does he think he's going?
- Don't think he planned this out.

1609
01:40:28,362 --> 01:40:30,697
If I hadn't said it before, by the way,

1610
01:40:30,781 --> 01:40:32,616
you're a terrible mentor.

1611
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:44,753
He did just beat you,
so I'm not a terrible mentor.

1612
01:40:44,837 --> 01:40:47,381
You're both equally terrible.
Does that settle it?

1613
01:40:48,882 --> 01:40:51,176
Stop pretending
you know where you're going!

1614
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:54,555
Oh, I have a plan.
I just haven't told you yet.

1615
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,489
- <i> Departing for the moon.
</i>-That's not good.

1616
01:41:31,175 --> 01:41:32,509
What are those, claws?

1617
01:41:32,593 --> 01:41:35,137
Dude, are you sure you're even Spider-Man?

1618
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:36,638
Are you?

1619
01:41:36,722 --> 01:41:38,932
Who do you think you are? Really?

1620
01:41:41,852 --> 01:41:44,813
My name is Miles Morales.

1621
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:53,363
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.

1622
01:41:55,282 --> 01:41:57,826
And I'm pretty sure
you know the rest, jerk!

1623
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:08,170
Hey. What's up, man?

1624
01:42:10,214 --> 01:42:12,341
You don't get it. You're an anomaly.

1625
01:42:12,424 --> 01:42:14,676
Not if you let me go home.

1626
01:42:18,347 --> 01:42:19,223
Snitch!

1627
01:42:21,266 --> 01:42:23,519
Everywhere you go, you're an anomaly.

1628
01:42:31,485 --> 01:42:34,154
You're the original anomaly.

1629
01:42:37,783 --> 01:42:38,951
Miguel!

1630
01:42:39,535 --> 01:42:43,747
The spider that gave you
your powers wasn't from your dimension.

1631
01:42:45,332 --> 01:42:47,334
It was never supposed to bite you.

1632
01:42:48,210 --> 01:42:49,044
Miguel, don't!

1633
01:42:49,127 --> 01:42:51,755
There's a world out there
with no Spider-Man to protect them

1634
01:42:51,839 --> 01:42:53,423
-because it bit you instead.
-No.

1635
01:42:53,507 --> 01:42:55,467
You're not supposed to be Spider-Man.

1636
01:42:55,551 --> 01:42:57,970
No! You're lying. I'm Spider-Man!

1637
01:42:58,053 --> 01:42:59,513
You're a mistake!

1638
01:43:01,473 --> 01:43:05,102
If you hadn't been bit,
your Peter Parker would have lived.

1639
01:43:05,185 --> 01:43:07,813
Instead, he died saving you.

1640
01:43:08,814 --> 01:43:11,233
He would've stopped the collider
before it ever went off.

1641
01:43:11,316 --> 01:43:12,568
Spot wouldn't exist.

1642
01:43:12,651 --> 01:43:15,904
- And none of this would've happened.
- Peter.

1643
01:43:15,988 --> 01:43:20,409
And all this time, I have been
the only one holding it all together.

1644
01:43:20,492 --> 01:43:24,246
- Miguel, go easy on him!
- You don't belong here.

1645
01:43:24,329 --> 01:43:25,497
You never did.

1646
01:43:25,581 --> 01:43:27,040
Let me go.

1647
01:43:27,124 --> 01:43:29,793
-Miguel, that's enough.
-This isn't what we talked about.

1648
01:43:31,086 --> 01:43:32,504
You talked about this?

1649
01:43:34,047 --> 01:43:35,090
You knew?

1650
01:43:37,384 --> 01:43:38,552
You all knew?

1651
01:43:39,803 --> 01:43:41,388
I didn't know...

1652
01:43:42,514 --> 01:43:43,724
how to tell you.

1653
01:43:45,392 --> 01:43:47,603
That's why you never came to see me.

1654
01:43:51,023 --> 01:43:54,318
-Miles, it's for your own good.
-Who decides that?

1655
01:43:54,943 --> 01:43:56,612
I'm not a kid, Gwen.

1656
01:43:57,446 --> 01:43:58,989
That's exactly what you are.

1657
01:43:59,072 --> 01:44:03,702
You're just a kid
who has no idea what he's doing!

1658
01:44:09,416 --> 01:44:10,584
Yeah, well,

1659
01:44:10,667 --> 01:44:13,921
I did lure hundreds of Spider-People
away from your little clubhouse.

1660
01:44:14,004 --> 01:44:14,838
What?

1661
01:44:20,636 --> 01:44:22,346
I guess he did plan this out.

1662
01:44:23,972 --> 01:44:26,600
And I'm about to do this.

1663
01:44:31,355 --> 01:44:35,776
Everyone keeps telling me
how my story is supposed to go.

1664
01:44:36,693 --> 01:44:37,819
Nah.

1665
01:44:37,903 --> 01:44:39,321
I'm gonna do my own thing.

1666
01:44:58,966 --> 01:45:00,217
Goodbye, Gwen.

1667
01:45:03,846 --> 01:45:04,930
Miles!

1668
01:45:09,142 --> 01:45:10,561
I taught him how to do that,

1669
01:45:10,644 --> 01:45:13,856
so I gotta be a pretty good mentor
to pull that off.

1670
01:45:24,658 --> 01:45:27,411
Nope. No. Uh-uh.

1671
01:45:27,995 --> 01:45:30,289
That's kind of cute. Oh, no. Mm-mm.

1672
01:45:30,372 --> 01:45:32,416
Been there. Done that.

1673
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:36,253
Huh?

1674
01:45:55,189 --> 01:45:57,316
<i>Initialising Go Home Machine.</i>

1675
01:46:10,495 --> 01:46:12,956
{\an8}<i>Dimensional signature identified.</i>

1676
01:46:22,716 --> 01:46:23,592
Come on.

1677
01:46:23,675 --> 01:46:25,219
No. No.

1678
01:46:25,302 --> 01:46:27,346
-Oh, no.
-No.

1679
01:46:33,143 --> 01:46:34,561
<i>What's happening?</i>

1680
01:46:34,645 --> 01:46:36,396
The machine activated on its own.

1681
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:38,357
<i>-How is that possible?
</i>-It isn't.

1682
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:40,526
It's not possible
for the accelerator protocol

1683
01:46:40,609 --> 01:46:42,486
to engage without entering a sequence key.

1684
01:46:42,569 --> 01:46:45,197
<i>-Okay. Which...?
</i>-Which it's doing right now.

1685
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:47,241
<i>-How about this?
</i>-No.

1686
01:46:47,324 --> 01:46:49,117
<i>-How about now?
</i>-You're getting in the way.

1687
01:47:06,885 --> 01:47:08,512
Stop him! Now!

1688
01:47:08,595 --> 01:47:10,973
What does it look like I'm trying to do?

1689
01:47:19,481 --> 01:47:20,399
Do something.

1690
01:47:21,191 --> 01:47:22,025
Now!

1691
01:47:24,736 --> 01:47:25,571
Miguel.

1692
01:47:25,654 --> 01:47:26,780
Miguel, stop!

1693
01:47:54,516 --> 01:47:55,642
No!

1694
01:48:09,781 --> 01:48:12,284
Okay. Enough.
It's not the console's fault.

1695
01:48:12,367 --> 01:48:14,244
All he had to do was listen!

1696
01:48:15,162 --> 01:48:17,497
-Why didn't he listen?
-Maybe you weren't hard enough.

1697
01:48:17,581 --> 01:48:19,917
- Gwen, don't do it.
- You let him go.

1698
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,418
-Me?
-You didn't catch him, Gwen.

1699
01:48:21,502 --> 01:48:24,755
-Okay, let's all just take a breath.
-Peter, you wanna back me up?

1700
01:48:24,838 --> 01:48:29,259
Well, okay, Miguel, as a father
of a daughter and the son of a mother--

1701
01:48:29,343 --> 01:48:31,553
-Yeah, actually, stop talking.
-Okay, duly noted.

1702
01:48:31,637 --> 01:48:33,263
Let me just talk to him.

1703
01:48:34,515 --> 01:48:35,516
We tried that.

1704
01:48:35,599 --> 01:48:37,684
-He's my friend.
-Yeah. And that's the problem.

1705
01:48:37,768 --> 01:48:40,812
Do you know for certain
what happens if he breaks the canon?

1706
01:48:42,105 --> 01:48:46,193
Do you wanna find out?
I told you she was a liability.

1707
01:48:47,444 --> 01:48:48,612
You're wrong.

1708
01:48:48,695 --> 01:48:50,614
Jess, tell him he's wrong.

1709
01:48:52,533 --> 01:48:53,659
He's not.

1710
01:48:53,742 --> 01:48:55,494
Are you serious right now?

1711
01:48:55,577 --> 01:48:59,873
I told you.
You let him get away, I can't help you.

1712
01:48:59,957 --> 01:49:01,542
I'm not coming.

1713
01:49:01,625 --> 01:49:02,793
You're right.

1714
01:49:02,876 --> 01:49:03,794
What...?

1715
01:49:05,587 --> 01:49:06,588
What the hell?

1716
01:49:16,598 --> 01:49:18,225
Go home, Gwen.

1717
01:49:23,605 --> 01:49:25,941
We are supposed to be the good guys.

1718
01:49:42,291 --> 01:49:43,292
We are.

1719
01:49:46,628 --> 01:49:47,796
We are.

1720
01:49:49,464 --> 01:49:51,675
Jess, Ben. Come with me.

1721
01:49:51,758 --> 01:49:52,759
Hell, yeah.

1722
01:49:52,843 --> 01:49:54,303
And somebody catch Spot.

1723
01:49:54,386 --> 01:49:57,306
Yeah. Sorry.
I gotta get her down for her nap.

1724
01:49:57,389 --> 01:50:00,309
Not you. I've had the right amount of you.

1725
01:50:48,357 --> 01:50:49,191
Hey, hon.

1726
01:50:53,028 --> 01:50:54,029
How was work?

1727
01:50:55,197 --> 01:50:56,365
I don't know.

1728
01:50:56,448 --> 01:50:59,868
Peter? Did you bring our baby
to another fight?

1729
01:50:59,952 --> 01:51:02,246
Did I bring our ba--? No. No, no.

1730
01:51:02,329 --> 01:51:05,332
'Cause you asked me not to.
So I didn't. I wouldn't.

1731
01:51:05,999 --> 01:51:08,710
<i>Access denied. Access denied.</i>

1732
01:51:36,864 --> 01:51:38,949
You think I'll be any good at this?

1733
01:51:40,367 --> 01:51:41,743
You're asking that now?

1734
01:51:43,745 --> 01:51:46,206
There's no playbook
for raising someone like her...

1735
01:51:47,374 --> 01:51:50,127
<i>or being someone like you.</i>

1736
01:51:54,381 --> 01:51:57,092
<i>You just gotta make
the right adjustments at half-time.</i>

1737
01:52:02,222 --> 01:52:04,808
-That's a sports metaphor, by the way.
-I understand.

1738
01:52:04,892 --> 01:52:07,561
Sorry. You were just such a nerd
in high school. I figured--

1739
01:52:07,644 --> 01:52:10,189
But I have watched sports.

1740
01:52:10,272 --> 01:52:12,316
-Okay, champ.
-Unbelievable.

1741
01:52:40,511 --> 01:52:41,678
Wanna go easy on the penguin?

1742
01:52:42,846 --> 01:52:44,139
Would you just...?

1743
01:52:45,098 --> 01:52:46,391
You gonna even look at me?

1744
01:52:48,769 --> 01:52:50,854
What? What is that?

1745
01:52:51,980 --> 01:52:54,399
I'm looking at you. Like you asked.

1746
01:52:57,110 --> 01:52:58,153
You look skinny.

1747
01:52:59,696 --> 01:53:00,739
Where have you been?

1748
01:53:00,822 --> 01:53:04,117
Just been, uh,
out murdering all my friends.

1749
01:53:04,743 --> 01:53:07,788
Oh, that's funny, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

1750
01:53:13,627 --> 01:53:15,754
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1751
01:53:20,050 --> 01:53:21,844
You're a good cop, Dad.

1752
01:53:22,970 --> 01:53:25,681
You put on that badge
because you know if you don't,

1753
01:53:25,764 --> 01:53:27,766
someone who shouldn't will.

1754
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:31,645
But you have to understand,

1755
01:53:31,728 --> 01:53:34,231
this mask is my badge.

1756
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:38,110
And I'm trying to be good too.

1757
01:53:38,610 --> 01:53:41,029
I was trying so hard

1758
01:53:41,113 --> 01:53:43,448
to wear this thing
the way you would want...

1759
01:53:44,032 --> 01:53:45,534
and I didn't.

1760
01:53:46,326 --> 01:53:47,369
I didn't.

1761
01:53:47,452 --> 01:53:51,039
I can do all these things, but I can't
help the people I love the most.

1762
01:53:51,123 --> 01:53:53,667
And they can only know half of who I am.

1763
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:57,212
So I'm completely on my own.

1764
01:53:57,296 --> 01:54:00,716
And now I don't even know
what the right thing is anymore.

1765
01:54:00,799 --> 01:54:03,760
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
But I know...

1766
01:54:05,804 --> 01:54:08,473
I can't lose one more friend.

1767
01:54:11,685 --> 01:54:15,147
Gwen, I always taught you
to do it by the book.

1768
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:16,773
And how did that work out?

1769
01:54:16,857 --> 01:54:19,735
-I took an oath.
-Then arrest me, Dad.

1770
01:54:20,986 --> 01:54:23,822
-Get it over with.
-I... I can't.

1771
01:54:23,906 --> 01:54:25,115
Why not?

1772
01:54:25,991 --> 01:54:27,242
Because I quit.

1773
01:54:28,577 --> 01:54:29,411
When?

1774
01:54:30,704 --> 01:54:32,664
About halfway through your big speech.

1775
01:54:33,498 --> 01:54:34,333
You're...

1776
01:54:34,833 --> 01:54:37,252
Wait a minute,
you're not gonna be captain?

1777
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:39,588
That means...

1778
01:54:41,298 --> 01:54:43,550
My job, being captain,

1779
01:54:44,301 --> 01:54:47,930
this whole thing doesn't matter anymore.

1780
01:54:52,309 --> 01:54:54,520
You're the best thing I've ever done.

1781
01:55:10,118 --> 01:55:12,788
-It was a good speech, huh?
-No wonder you got an A in English.

1782
01:55:12,871 --> 01:55:14,790
B. I got a B-plus.

1783
01:55:14,873 --> 01:55:16,208
Missed a few classes.

1784
01:55:18,001 --> 01:55:20,212
I don't know what it is you gotta do...

1785
01:55:22,047 --> 01:55:24,550
but I think
that this thing is supposed to help.

1786
01:55:26,718 --> 01:55:29,096
The guy who left it was
a real piece of work.

1787
01:55:53,829 --> 01:55:54,997
I'll be right back.

1788
01:55:57,124 --> 01:55:58,125
Promise.

1789
01:56:06,216 --> 01:56:08,552
Parenting stuff is...

1790
01:56:10,137 --> 01:56:11,430
a big-ass mystery.

1791
01:56:17,811 --> 01:56:19,271
<i>You're a mistake!</i>

1792
01:56:19,354 --> 01:56:22,941
<i>If you hadn't been bit,
your Peter Parker would have lived.</i>

1793
01:56:23,483 --> 01:56:25,569
<i>And none of this would've happened.</i>

1794
01:56:25,652 --> 01:56:28,238
<i>Miles, the hardest thing about this job</i>

1795
01:56:28,322 --> 01:56:30,574
<i>is you can't always save everybody.</i>

1796
01:56:30,657 --> 01:56:34,286
<i>I'll make you pay
for everything you took away from me.</i>

1797
01:56:34,369 --> 01:56:36,496
<i>You have a choice
between saving one person</i>

1798
01:56:36,580 --> 01:56:38,332
<i>and saving an entire world.</i>

1799
01:56:38,415 --> 01:56:40,501
<i>I can do both. Spider-Man always--</i>

1800
01:56:40,584 --> 01:56:41,543
<i>Not always.</i>

1801
01:56:41,627 --> 01:56:44,796
<i>Whatever you're gonna do out there,
don't get lost.</i>

1802
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:48,342
- <i>Bad things are gonna happen.
- </i>-<i>I didn't know how to tell you.</i>

1803
01:56:48,425 --> 01:56:50,344
<i>You were never supposed
to be Spider-Man.</i>

1804
01:56:53,013 --> 01:56:54,014
<i>Keep going.</i>

1805
01:57:11,406 --> 01:57:12,658
Did you check your locations?

1806
01:57:12,741 --> 01:57:14,159
-Yes, Dad.
-No sign of him.

1807
01:57:14,243 --> 01:57:18,288
LYLA, would you send everyone out?
Anywhere. Anywhere he might be.

1808
01:57:18,372 --> 01:57:19,540
Congrats, captain.

1809
01:57:19,623 --> 01:57:22,251
"Captain"? You can't call me that
until I'm sworn in.

1810
01:57:22,334 --> 01:57:24,711
We're all proud of you. See you, <i>jefe.</i>

1811
01:57:51,989 --> 01:57:53,740
Perfect pose.

1812
01:57:55,701 --> 01:57:58,579
Possible disturbance in the alley.
Better go check it out.

1813
01:57:59,288 --> 01:58:03,250
Now I'm here in the alley.
There's something unusual happening.

1814
01:58:03,333 --> 01:58:05,419
Looking at the walls. Those are normal.

1815
01:58:05,502 --> 01:58:08,172
But there's something in front of me.

1816
01:58:29,067 --> 01:58:30,152
I made it.

1817
01:58:31,028 --> 01:58:32,029
I'm home.

1818
01:58:37,284 --> 01:58:38,493
Miles?

1819
01:58:43,665 --> 01:58:45,125
Is now a bad time?

1820
01:58:45,209 --> 01:58:47,252
-Am I too late?
-What'd you do to your hair?

1821
01:58:47,336 --> 01:58:49,254
Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay.

1822
01:58:50,297 --> 01:58:51,131
I'm okay.

1823
01:58:52,007 --> 01:58:55,010
You were right.
You were right about everything.

1824
01:58:55,093 --> 01:58:57,012
Of course I'm right. I'm always right.

1825
01:58:57,095 --> 01:59:00,891
-What am I right about?
-I saw all these amazing places

1826
01:59:00,974 --> 01:59:03,685
and met all these amazing people, but...

1827
01:59:07,356 --> 01:59:08,774
But they didn't want me.

1828
01:59:09,691 --> 01:59:11,818
I kept thinking about what you said.

1829
01:59:13,070 --> 01:59:14,863
And I let them have it, Mom.

1830
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:17,616
I beat them all.

1831
01:59:21,286 --> 01:59:23,413
I know how strong I am now.

1832
01:59:24,748 --> 01:59:26,750
I'm strong because of you.

1833
01:59:27,709 --> 01:59:28,544
And Dad.

1834
01:59:30,087 --> 01:59:31,088
And us.

1835
01:59:33,924 --> 01:59:34,758
Mom.

1836
01:59:36,343 --> 01:59:38,262
There's something coming for us.

1837
01:59:39,429 --> 01:59:40,430
Something...

1838
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:42,057
Something terrible.

1839
01:59:42,140 --> 01:59:44,893
Miles, you're talking crazy.
What's going on?

1840
01:59:44,977 --> 01:59:48,230
His name is Spot. He's my nemesis.

1841
01:59:49,731 --> 01:59:51,108
And I'm gonna stop him.

1842
01:59:56,613 --> 01:59:58,949
I know you know I've been lying to you.

1843
01:59:59,950 --> 02:00:02,244
It's because I thought if you knew...

1844
02:00:03,662 --> 02:00:05,455
you wouldn't love me the same.

1845
02:00:08,041 --> 02:00:09,960
And then I went out there and...

1846
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:12,171
And now...

1847
02:00:14,173 --> 02:00:15,799
I'm not afraid of anything.

1848
02:00:18,677 --> 02:00:20,220
What do you wanna tell me?

1849
02:00:20,304 --> 02:00:22,014
Promise nothing's gonna change.

1850
02:00:22,097 --> 02:00:24,600
<i>-Papá,</i> I will always love you.
-You gotta promise.

1851
02:00:24,683 --> 02:00:27,519
Always. I don't care what you say.

1852
02:00:28,437 --> 02:00:29,730
Do <i>¿me entiendes?</i>

1853
02:00:36,653 --> 02:00:37,487
Mom.

1854
02:00:39,740 --> 02:00:40,574
I'm...

1855
02:00:42,534 --> 02:00:43,744
I'm Spider-Man.

1856
02:00:55,005 --> 02:00:56,173
Who's Spider-Man?

1857
02:00:58,634 --> 02:01:01,887
The superhero? He got bit by a spider?

1858
02:01:03,472 --> 02:01:05,057
Gave him spider powers?

1859
02:01:07,809 --> 02:01:08,644
He's me?

1860
02:01:13,732 --> 02:01:17,110
Is this where you dress up
like your favourite character for...?

1861
02:01:17,194 --> 02:01:19,154
What's it called? Comics-Con?

1862
02:01:19,238 --> 02:01:20,656
I don't know what that is.

1863
02:01:20,739 --> 02:01:24,284
You really had me going there. Spider-Man.

1864
02:01:32,251 --> 02:01:33,585
Why don't you have eight arms?

1865
02:01:33,669 --> 02:01:35,879
-Um...
-Do you push silk out of your <i>culito?</i>

1866
02:01:35,963 --> 02:01:38,674
-I had a nightmare about that, but no.
-Are you sure you woke up?

1867
02:01:57,276 --> 02:02:00,487
Mom, stop playing around. This is serious.

1868
02:02:00,571 --> 02:02:02,197
Dad worked with Spider-Man.

1869
02:02:02,281 --> 02:02:05,701
He didn't realise Spider-Man was me
at the time, but...

1870
02:02:05,784 --> 02:02:08,704
-I wish Dad was here to explain.
-Miles, please.

1871
02:02:12,583 --> 02:02:16,420
I got you to take care of,
I got me to take care of, so help me out.

1872
02:02:16,503 --> 02:02:18,505
Mom, hold on, hold on. I need to talk--

1873
02:02:24,595 --> 02:02:25,429
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1874
02:02:29,933 --> 02:02:31,768
<i>He's in the wrong universe.</i>

1875
02:02:32,895 --> 02:02:36,106
<i>The spider that gave you
your powers wasn't from your dimension.</i>

1876
02:02:36,190 --> 02:02:39,776
- Forty-two.
<i>-  Its home dimension.</i>

1877
02:02:42,571 --> 02:02:44,907
<i>Dimensional signature identified.</i>

1878
02:02:46,033 --> 02:02:47,159
{\an8}<i>That machine...</i>

1879
02:02:50,204 --> 02:02:51,538
{\an8}<i>didn't send me home.</i>

1880
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:07,095
Uncle Aaron?

1881
02:03:08,430 --> 02:03:09,264
Hey.

1882
02:03:20,901 --> 02:03:21,735
You okay?

1883
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:30,244
I missed you so much.

1884
02:03:30,327 --> 02:03:32,704
Okay. All right, then.

1885
02:03:33,372 --> 02:03:35,666
-Whoa, you took your braids out?
-Uh...

1886
02:03:35,749 --> 02:03:37,000
-On purpose?
-Yeah.

1887
02:03:37,084 --> 02:03:40,838
Yeah, I'm still getting used to it?

1888
02:03:41,713 --> 02:03:45,259
They gave me more hours at the hospital,
so next month I swear I'll pay you back.

1889
02:03:45,342 --> 02:03:46,844
Stop. Come on. We family.

1890
02:03:47,886 --> 02:03:48,720
Thanks.

1891
02:03:50,430 --> 02:03:53,600
{\an8}-Hey, honey, how you doing?
- Hey. How'd it go with Miles?

1892
02:03:53,684 --> 02:03:56,645
-You know how you grounded him?
-Mm-hm.

1893
02:03:56,728 --> 02:03:59,231
-I ungrounded him.
-You what?

1894
02:03:59,314 --> 02:04:01,900
A little. I mean, how much trouble
could he get into, right?

1895
02:04:01,984 --> 02:04:04,361
- A lot of trouble!
- I don't wanna think about it.

1896
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:08,949
Oh, Miles, I have to work
an overnight tonight.

1897
02:04:09,032 --> 02:04:11,410
-Here's the grocery list.
-I'll make sure he gets these done.

1898
02:04:13,245 --> 02:04:14,371
All right, we gotta roll.

1899
02:04:19,418 --> 02:04:21,879
Security switches out at 6.
That's the window, right?

1900
02:04:22,546 --> 02:04:23,839
Right. Yeah.

1901
02:04:24,756 --> 02:04:29,178
I'm following you in what you are saying.

1902
02:04:33,056 --> 02:04:33,891
You all right?

1903
02:04:35,184 --> 02:04:36,310
I have a cold.

1904
02:04:38,228 --> 02:04:39,229
Come on, man.

1905
02:04:40,230 --> 02:04:41,899
Hey, you sure you got the plan?

1906
02:04:41,982 --> 02:04:45,569
Yeah, but maybe we should
go over it one more time,

1907
02:04:45,652 --> 02:04:47,529
just to make sure there's no...

1908
02:04:48,614 --> 02:04:49,615
problems.

1909
02:04:57,289 --> 02:04:59,166
There's no Spider-Man here.

1910
02:05:29,863 --> 02:05:33,200
I'm sorry, baby,
but you did unilaterally unground him.

1911
02:05:33,283 --> 02:05:34,117
Jeff...

1912
02:05:34,201 --> 02:05:37,788
I just worry about him getting
mixed up with the wrong people, okay?

1913
02:05:37,871 --> 02:05:39,623
This is probably that girl.

1914
02:05:39,706 --> 02:05:41,792
What is he even thinking, being with her?

1915
02:05:41,875 --> 02:05:43,460
I have some ideas.

1916
02:05:43,544 --> 02:05:47,339
-Baby, you're really not helping.
-You saw the way he lit up around her.

1917
02:05:48,674 --> 02:05:50,884
I just hope she doesn't get him hurt.

1918
02:05:53,595 --> 02:05:55,722
I mean, am I responsible for this?

1919
02:05:55,806 --> 02:05:57,891
-No, no.
-Maybe it's all my fault.

1920
02:05:57,975 --> 02:06:00,769
Come on, <i>papá</i>, you're a great dad.
This is hard.

1921
02:06:00,853 --> 02:06:02,062
This is hard.

1922
02:06:02,145 --> 02:06:07,192
It's like we got a whole new kid
who just wants to grow up so fast.

1923
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:11,029
And maybe we gotta grow up too.

1924
02:06:12,781 --> 02:06:13,782
A little bit.

1925
02:06:13,866 --> 02:06:16,910
Maybe we just gotta let him
spread his wings, man.

1926
02:06:17,536 --> 02:06:18,620
"Man"?

1927
02:06:18,704 --> 02:06:20,205
It's not your fault.

1928
02:06:23,166 --> 02:06:24,334
It's mine.

1929
02:06:24,418 --> 02:06:27,379
Oh, come on.
What the heck are you doing here?

1930
02:06:27,462 --> 02:06:29,631
Oh, uh, his window was open so I came in.

1931
02:06:29,715 --> 02:06:32,009
Because that's normal to do.

1932
02:06:32,092 --> 02:06:33,802
I wanna talk to your parents.

1933
02:06:33,886 --> 02:06:35,888
Right. My, uh, dad's kind of hard
to get on the horn.

1934
02:06:35,971 --> 02:06:38,390
Oh, really? What does he do? Deal drugs?

1935
02:06:39,099 --> 02:06:40,225
He's a cop.

1936
02:06:42,436 --> 02:06:43,937
Statement withdrawn.

1937
02:06:44,021 --> 02:06:45,439
I'm gonna call the station.

1938
02:06:45,522 --> 02:06:48,775
I don't think he's there.
Or anywhere around here.

1939
02:06:48,859 --> 02:06:51,987
-That's his jacket, emo. Where's Miles?
-I don't know.

1940
02:06:52,070 --> 02:06:54,114
You don't know?
What do you mean, you don't know?

1941
02:06:54,198 --> 02:06:55,657
Yeah, um, I'll leave.

1942
02:06:55,741 --> 02:06:58,118
Where do you think you're going,
young lady?

1943
02:06:58,202 --> 02:06:59,870
I'm going to find him.

1944
02:07:00,996 --> 02:07:02,789
<i>I don't know where, exactly.</i>

1945
02:07:04,416 --> 02:07:05,959
<i>But I know where to start.</i>

1946
02:07:07,753 --> 02:07:09,588
One thing I learned from Miles:

1947
02:07:11,215 --> 02:07:12,591
It's all possible.

1948
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:18,388
He loves you more
than you could ever imagine.

1949
02:07:22,684 --> 02:07:23,685
I've seen it.

1950
02:07:29,107 --> 02:07:30,567
If you do find him...

1951
02:07:32,819 --> 02:07:34,446
tell him five months.

1952
02:07:37,074 --> 02:07:38,575
And tell him we love him.

1953
02:07:40,536 --> 02:07:41,370
You got it.

1954
02:08:15,612 --> 02:08:18,198
Uncle Aaron?

1955
02:08:23,579 --> 02:08:24,413
Wait, wait.

1956
02:08:25,163 --> 02:08:26,915
Listen to me. Okay, look.

1957
02:08:31,503 --> 02:08:33,922
You don't understand. I'm not from here.

1958
02:08:34,006 --> 02:08:37,259
Listen, okay?
This machine sent me here by mistake.

1959
02:08:37,342 --> 02:08:39,803
Wait, wait, wait. Please. Please.

1960
02:08:39,887 --> 02:08:42,472
Uncle Aaron, wait, wait, wait.
Uncle Aaron!

1961
02:08:59,364 --> 02:09:01,533
Please. Uncle Aaron?

1962
02:09:02,743 --> 02:09:04,244
Just hear me out.

1963
02:09:07,956 --> 02:09:10,584
I was bit by a spider that gave me powers.

1964
02:09:11,418 --> 02:09:14,838
It wasn't supposed to bite me.
It was supposed to bite someone else.

1965
02:09:14,922 --> 02:09:16,089
Someone from here.

1966
02:09:16,924 --> 02:09:19,259
I don't belong here. I need to go home.

1967
02:09:19,843 --> 02:09:20,677
Okay?

1968
02:09:23,013 --> 02:09:25,682
I have an Uncle Aaron too. I had one.

1969
02:09:25,766 --> 02:09:28,727
He was a bad guy called the Prowler.

1970
02:09:30,103 --> 02:09:31,522
He looked out for me.

1971
02:09:31,605 --> 02:09:34,441
He did a lot of bad things, but...

1972
02:09:34,525 --> 02:09:36,902
I knew he wanted to be good.

1973
02:09:36,985 --> 02:09:39,780
He just didn't know he had a choice,
but you do.

1974
02:09:40,739 --> 02:09:41,823
You can be a good guy.

1975
02:09:43,867 --> 02:09:45,285
"A good guy"?

1976
02:09:45,911 --> 02:09:49,164
Please. Trust me.
I know you don't wanna be the Prowler.

1977
02:10:01,927 --> 02:10:02,761
I'm not.

1978
02:10:16,191 --> 02:10:19,611
<i>Mayor Manfredi
has extended New York's mandatory curfew</i>

1979
02:10:19,695 --> 02:10:23,991
<i>as the so-called Sinister Six cartels
battle for control on the streets.</i>

1980
02:10:24,074 --> 02:10:25,826
<i>Is nobody gonna try and stop them?</i>

1981
02:10:41,508 --> 02:10:43,218
Your dad is still alive?

1982
02:10:43,927 --> 02:10:44,928
What?

1983
02:10:45,596 --> 02:10:46,638
Your father.

1984
02:10:47,431 --> 02:10:49,141
You said he's still alive.

1985
02:10:50,309 --> 02:10:51,143
Yeah.

1986
02:10:56,315 --> 02:10:57,566
Who are you?

1987
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:08,035
I'm Miles Morales.

1988
02:11:10,537 --> 02:11:11,538
But you...

1989
02:11:12,414 --> 02:11:14,082
You can call me the Prowler.

1990
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:17,794
If I don't get home...

1991
02:11:19,213 --> 02:11:21,131
our dad is gonna die.

1992
02:11:21,215 --> 02:11:22,216
Your dad.

1993
02:11:24,885 --> 02:11:25,719
Please.

1994
02:11:27,804 --> 02:11:29,223
You have to let me go.

1995
02:11:35,062 --> 02:11:36,355
Why would I do that?

1996
02:12:36,456 --> 02:12:37,541
Don't tell Mom.

1997
02:12:44,673 --> 02:12:46,550
<i>I never found the right band to join.</i>

1998
02:12:48,635 --> 02:12:50,554
<i>So I started my own.</i>

1999
02:12:54,433 --> 02:12:55,809
<i>With a few old friends.</i>

2000
02:13:18,123 --> 02:13:19,124
<i>You want in?</i>
