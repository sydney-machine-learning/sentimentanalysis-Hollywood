1
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,240
In other parts of the world,

2
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:55,201
young men leave home and
travel far and wide...

3
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:58,038
in search of a promising future.

4
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:02,584
Their journeys are often fuelled
by dreams of triumphing over evil,

5
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,794
finding a great love...

6
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:08,381
or the hope of
fortunes easily made.

7
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:13,386
Here in St. Cloud's, not even the decision
to get off the train is easily made,

8
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:17,557
for it requires an earlier,
more difficult decision...

9
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:21,936
add a child to your life
or leave one behind.

10
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,857
The only reason people journey
here is for the orphanage.

11
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:28,193
- Good morning.
- We have an appointment.

12
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:30,987
Yes. Come in. Welcome to St.
Cloud's.

13
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:33,531
We're going right
upstairs to see Dr Larch.

14
00:02:33,657 --> 00:02:36,117
I came as a physician to
the abandoned children...

15
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:39,496
and unhappily pregnant women.

16
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:42,123
I had hoped to become a hero.

17
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:45,752
But in St. Cloud's, there
was no such position.

18
00:02:45,835 --> 00:02:48,588
In the lonely, sordid
world of lost children,

19
00:02:48,672 --> 00:02:51,758
there were no
heroes to be found.

20
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:54,219
And so I became the
caretaker of many,

21
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:56,388
father of none.

22
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:59,766
Well, in a way, there was one.

23
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,893
Here he is.

24
00:03:01,977 --> 00:03:04,604
His name was Homer Wells.

25
00:03:04,688 --> 00:03:09,109
I named him after
the Greek writer.

26
00:03:09,192 --> 00:03:11,236
You know, Homer, of course?

27
00:03:13,154 --> 00:03:17,784
And I made his name Wells
because I could tell he was...

28
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:20,537
very deep.

29
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,622
In truth, Nurse
Angela named him.

30
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:25,959
Her father drilled wells, and she
once owned a cat named Homer.

31
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:28,294
Bye-bye, Homer.

32
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:36,094
- Good night, you Princes of Maine,
- Can we see the doctor?

33
00:03:36,177 --> 00:03:39,097
You Kings of New England.

34
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,433
- Good night.
- Doctor?

35
00:03:41,516 --> 00:03:44,811
Doctor? There's something
wrong with him.

36
00:03:44,894 --> 00:03:48,148
- He never makes a sound.
- He didn't cry.

37
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:51,776
Orphan babies learn
there's no point in it.

38
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,196
Do you think we could have a look
at someone a little different?

39
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:05,665
Thus was Homer Wells returned.
He was too happy a baby.

40
00:04:05,749 --> 00:04:08,293
Bye, Homer.

41
00:04:08,376 --> 00:04:13,131
The second family to adopt him had a
gift for getting sounds out of Homer.

42
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:15,634
They beat him.

43
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:18,094
He couldn't stop crying.

44
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:21,681
Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh.

45
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:27,103
It's okay now.

46
00:04:27,187 --> 00:04:29,689
Nobody's gonna hurt you any more

47
00:04:29,773 --> 00:04:33,860
Here in St. Cloud's, I try to consider
with each rule I make or break...

48
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:37,530
that my first priority
is an orphan's future.

49
00:04:37,614 --> 00:04:41,034
Twice adopted, twice returned.

50
00:04:41,117 --> 00:04:43,495
It didn't bode well.

51
00:04:47,457 --> 00:04:52,045
And yet it was always clear to
me that he was a special boy.

52
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:55,382
Near the angle of the rib.
And...

53
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:57,884
- It was with Homer's future in mind...
- Homer?

54
00:04:57,968 --> 00:05:02,305
- That I began his tutorials.
- If you're going to stay at St. Cloud's,

55
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:04,474
I expect you to be of use.

56
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:07,352
I admit that our
lessons were, in part,

57
00:05:07,435 --> 00:05:11,982
- the simple expression of a father's love.
- Homer.

58
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:14,859
But in failing to
withhold love...

59
00:05:14,943 --> 00:05:17,904
and making the
orphanage his home,

60
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:23,410
had I created a true and
everlasting orphan?

61
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:26,705
- No!
- Keep breathing. You're gonna be okay.

62
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:30,583
And so my excellent pupil learned
to look after abandoned children...

63
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:34,671
- and to deliver unwanted babies.
- Relax!

64
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:38,341
Long ago, I had decided
that sometimes...

65
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:41,344
it was the women who
needed to be delivered.

66
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:51,354
I chose my own path.

67
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:54,899
No one would ever
choose for Homer Wells.

68
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:11,291
I saw the splendour
of the moonlight

69
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:16,296
On Honolulu Bay

70
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:19,549
There's something
tender in the moonlight

71
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:24,429
On Honolulu Bay

72
00:06:24,512 --> 00:06:29,142
And all the beaches
are full of peaches

73
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:33,229
Who bring their youth along

74
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:36,483
And in the glimmer
of the moonlight

75
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:41,655
They love to sing this song

76
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:47,661
If you like the Ukulele Lady

77
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:52,624
- Ukulele Lady like you
- Dr Larch!

78
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:57,712
Dr Larch!

79
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,676
Dr Larch?

80
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,095
We have two new patients.

81
00:07:05,178 --> 00:07:07,639
- One to deliver.
- Coming.

82
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:12,686
- First pregnancy?
- Yes, for both.

83
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:16,106
I presume you'd prefer
handling the delivery?

84
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:18,858
All I said was, I don't
wanna perform abortions.

85
00:07:18,942 --> 00:07:21,486
I have no argument with
you performing them.

86
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:24,864
You know how to help these women.
How can you not feel obligated...

87
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:27,534
to help them when they can't
get help anywhere else?

88
00:07:27,617 --> 00:07:32,038
One: It's illegal. Two: I didn't ask
how to do it. You just showed me.

89
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:36,501
What else could I have shown you, Homer? The
only thing I can teach you is what I know.

90
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:40,380
In any life, you
have to be of use.

91
00:07:40,463 --> 00:07:42,716
Of use? Of use.

92
00:07:44,718 --> 00:07:49,556
That was good, Carla. That was perfect.
Everything's gonna be fine.

93
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,518
- I don't wanna see it.
- You don't have to see it, dear. Don't worry.

94
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:57,355
I don't even wanna know what
sex it is, so don't tell me!

95
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,234
- We won't tell you. You're gonna be okay.
- Your baby's gonna be okay too.

96
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:04,404
- I don't wanna know!
- That's a big boy.

97
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:07,365
Let me see him.

98
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,534
I wanna see him.

99
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:13,872
- Would you mind joining me in the nursery?
- Okay.

100
00:08:17,917 --> 00:08:20,879
Wilbur, the adopting couple
is waiting in your office.

101
00:08:20,962 --> 00:08:25,008
Life is waiting. Let 'em wait.

102
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:27,093
Where's the name sheet?

103
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:29,512
Uh, nobody's named this one yet.

104
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:35,435
Oh, it's my turn. Henceforth,
you shall be Little Dorrit.

105
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:37,854
Oh.

106
00:08:37,937 --> 00:08:40,273
No, you don't like that, do you?

107
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:42,859
He's a boy, that's why.

108
00:08:42,942 --> 00:08:45,195
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?

109
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,114
- I don't think so.
- You do it.

110
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:50,575
Okay.

111
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:54,120
Henceforth, you shall
be Little Wilbur.

112
00:08:57,332 --> 00:08:59,292
I'm not crazy about
the "Little."

113
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:02,545
Okay, just Wilbur then.

114
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:07,550
We haven't had a Wilbur in a year or
so, have we? We used to have dozens.

115
00:09:07,717 --> 00:09:10,136
He sniffs that ether.
I've seen him do it.

116
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,973
It's because he's too tired to sleep.
He has to.

117
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:15,141
He smells like he could
put you to sleep.

118
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:17,978
He's a doctor, Buster.
Doctors smell like ether.

119
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:20,730
- You're a doctor, Homer. You don't smell like ether.
- I'm not a doctor.

120
00:09:20,814 --> 00:09:24,109
I haven't been to medical school. I
haven't even been to high school.

121
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:28,822
- But you've studied with the old man for years.
- I'm not a doctor.

122
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:31,825
I'm sorry, Homer.

123
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:33,952
I saw the splendour
of the moonlight

124
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:37,163
On Honolulu Bay

125
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:39,332
Fuzzy is not uncommon.

126
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:44,504
There's something about the premature
babies of alcoholic mothers.

127
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:47,590
They seem to be susceptible to
every damn thing that comes along.

128
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:50,468
I haven't read that.

129
00:09:50,552 --> 00:09:53,596
I haven't either, but you will.

130
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,142
Those morons who write the books
ought to do some research here.

131
00:09:57,225 --> 00:09:59,769
Isn't Fuzzy just underdeveloped?

132
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:02,022
When doesn't he have bronchitis?

133
00:10:02,105 --> 00:10:06,443
I wouldn't call his bronchial
infection underdeveloped, would you?

134
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:09,321
Come on, Fuzz.

135
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:12,615
Here we go. Feet up.

136
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:14,951
There you are.

137
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:17,829
- What's going on here?
- Sit up straight.

138
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:24,627
Wilbur? Wilbur, can you
come out here, please?

139
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:27,839
There you go.

140
00:10:27,922 --> 00:10:31,635
- Hi, Homer.
- Hey. What is it, Mary Agnes?

141
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:35,555
Now calm down.

142
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,559
- What is it?
- Look.

143
00:10:39,643 --> 00:10:42,896
Oh. Uh, did you bite it?

144
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:47,525
- Did you bite your tongue?
- I don't remember.

145
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:53,573
Uh, yeah. That looks like you bit it.
You'll be fine.

146
00:10:53,657 --> 00:10:57,744
Well, maybe I was kissing
someone and he bit me.

147
00:10:57,827 --> 00:11:00,914
Oh, I think you bit it. Maybe in
your sleep. Story time, Fuzzy.

148
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:05,001
O Lord, support us
all the day long...

149
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:09,214
until the shadows lengthen
and the evening comes...

150
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:14,010
and the busy world is hushed and
the fever of life is over...

151
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:16,096
and our work is done.

152
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:18,181
Then in Thy mercy,

153
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:22,894
grant us a safe lodging
and a holy rest...

154
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:24,938
And peace at the last.

155
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:28,525
- Amen.
- Amen.

156
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:30,694
"A dog, which had lain
concealed till now...

157
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:33,613
"ran backwards and
forwards on the parapet...

158
00:11:33,697 --> 00:11:35,865
"with a dismal howl.

159
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:38,118
"And collecting
himself for a spring,

160
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:41,621
"jumped for the dead
man's shoulders.

161
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:44,290
"Missing his aim, he
fell into a ditch...

162
00:11:44,374 --> 00:11:47,127
"turning completely
over as he went...

163
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,421
"and striking his head
against the stone,

164
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:52,298
dashed out his brains."

165
00:11:52,382 --> 00:11:54,426
And that...

166
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:56,469
Is the end of the chapter.

167
00:12:02,058 --> 00:12:04,227
That's it till tomorrow.

168
00:12:10,442 --> 00:12:13,737
Good night, you
Princes of Maine,

169
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:15,822
you Kings of New England.

170
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:22,162
Good night, Princes of
Maine, Kings of New England.

171
00:12:22,287 --> 00:12:24,289
Whoa.

172
00:12:25,457 --> 00:12:28,752
John, you all right?

173
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:32,088
Why does Dr Larch say
that every night?

174
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:37,260
- Maybe to scare us.
- No, you jerk.

175
00:12:37,385 --> 00:12:40,055
Dr Larch loves us.

176
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:42,807
But why does he do that?

177
00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:47,228
- Does it because we like it.
- Do you like it, Curly?

178
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:50,482
Yeah.

179
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:53,360
I like it too.

180
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:56,404
Watch the door.

181
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:59,032
You two get Copperfield and Curly.
Buster's mine.

182
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:02,327
- And remember, nobody touches Fuzzy.
- Attack!

183
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,789
Hey!

184
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,050
- Ow!
- Ouch.

185
00:13:27,102 --> 00:13:29,938
What do you think you're doing?

186
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:34,401
Children, stop it. No fighting.
Share the snowballs.

187
00:13:39,948 --> 00:13:41,908
Fuzzy. Fuzzy.

188
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:44,411
Listen to you.
You've been running.

189
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:58,591
Hey, over here! Look! Pick me!

190
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:10,061
I know the type. They'll
take one of the babies.

191
00:14:18,194 --> 00:14:20,155
Mary Agnes.

192
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:26,911
Come here. Don't run.

193
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:29,039
Fuzzy.

194
00:14:29,164 --> 00:14:31,291
Curly.

195
00:14:38,006 --> 00:14:41,009
John.

196
00:14:43,178 --> 00:14:45,138
Hazel.

197
00:14:47,557 --> 00:14:49,684
Andy.

198
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,129
They wanted a girl, Curly.

199
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:20,674
Nobody ever wants me.

200
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,719
Oh, hey. Hey, come on.

201
00:15:24,803 --> 00:15:26,846
Come here.

202
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,849
You know, you're one
of the best, Curly.

203
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:32,185
And we wouldn't let
just anyone take you.

204
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:35,897
Dr Larch wouldn't let just
anyone take any of us.

205
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:37,983
Well, that's true.

206
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:42,153
- Nobody's asked for me, have they?
- Nobody special enough, Curly.

207
00:15:42,237 --> 00:15:44,531
You mean somebody has?

208
00:15:44,614 --> 00:15:47,575
Only the right
people can have you.

209
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:50,328
Now what do you say we
go unpack your suitcase?

210
00:15:50,412 --> 00:15:53,581
- It's movie night tonight, Curly.
- Okay.

211
00:16:23,153 --> 00:16:25,613
Look. Kong thinks
she's his mother.

212
00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:28,283
- His mother?
- He thinks she's his mother.

213
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:32,912
- He doesn't think she's his mother, Fuzzy.
- He does so. He loves her.

214
00:16:32,996 --> 00:16:36,124
- That's why he holds her.
- Shh, Fuzzy.

215
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:43,798
Fuzzy, how can she
be his mother?

216
00:16:43,882 --> 00:16:46,635
He just thinks she is.

217
00:16:50,972 --> 00:16:53,141
They want to replace me.

218
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:55,977
The board of trustees
wants to replace me.

219
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:58,313
They just want you to
hire some new help.

220
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:01,650
We don't need any more help.
Some new things would be useful.

221
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:04,152
Yuck!

222
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:07,489
Aw, come on.

223
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:11,493
- Homer, I need you.
- Happens every time.

224
00:17:13,662 --> 00:17:15,997
Kong, Kong, Kong,
Kong, Kong, Kong!

225
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:20,001
Thought you'd taken care of this.
Always breaks in the same place.

226
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:24,964
- It's your splice, isn't it?
- No, it is your splice. You blame me for everything.

227
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:28,927
Angela, we need a new movie, a
new projector, a new typewriter.

228
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,012
That's what needs
replacing around here.

229
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:34,307
- Wilbur, we have a delivery.
- Homer, would you get this one?

230
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:37,978
She's a patient, right?
She should see a doctor.

231
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:41,815
Homer, you are a skilled
and gifted surgeon...

232
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:45,652
with near perfect obstetrical
and gynaecological procedure.

233
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:49,656
I just mean that I'd rather
fix the movie tonight.

234
00:17:50,782 --> 00:17:53,326
Okay, sure.

235
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,787
You splice, I'll deliver.

236
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:07,465
Come on, Fuzz. Let's go.
Let go. Come on.

237
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:10,468
Homer, doesn't King Kong think
the woman is his mother?

238
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:14,681
- That's right, Fuzz. That's what Kong thinks.
- That's why Kong loves her.

239
00:18:14,764 --> 00:18:17,225
It's your turn. I'll get this.

240
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:20,895
Okay. Story time!

241
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:28,570
The Personal History
of David Copperfield.

242
00:18:28,653 --> 00:18:32,073
Chapter one. "I am born."

243
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:36,077
"Whether I shall turn out to
be the hero of my own life...

244
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:41,249
"or whether that station will be held
by anybody else, these pages must show.

245
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,169
"I was a posthumous child.

246
00:18:44,252 --> 00:18:47,589
"My father's eyes had closed
upon the light of this world...

247
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:51,259
Six months when
mine opened on it."

248
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:54,054
His father's dead, right?

249
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:56,556
That's right, Fuzz.

250
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,683
Is your father dead?

251
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:02,145
Cirrhosis. It's a
disease of the liver.

252
00:19:03,772 --> 00:19:05,940
What, a liver killed him?

253
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:10,362
No, alcohol killed him. He
drank himself to death.

254
00:19:10,445 --> 00:19:13,448
- But did you know him?
- Barely.

255
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:16,451
But it hardly mattered
that I knew him.

256
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:19,037
- Did you know your mother better?
- Mm-hmm.

257
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,124
She's dead now too.
She was a nanny.

258
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,210
What's a nanny do?

259
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:27,712
She looks after other
people's children.

260
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:31,383
- Did she grow up around here?
- No.

261
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:35,637
- She was an immigrant.
- What's an immigrant?

262
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:38,890
Someone not from Maine.

263
00:19:43,144 --> 00:19:45,605
Let us be happy for Hazel.

264
00:19:45,689 --> 00:19:48,984
Hazel has found a family.
Good night, Hazel.

265
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,569
Good night, Hazel.

266
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,862
I was dreaming about you.
How beautiful you were.

267
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:36,448
- Ah, you weren't.
- I was.

268
00:20:36,531 --> 00:20:39,367
- And I was beautiful?
- You were.

269
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:41,870
You are.

270
00:20:41,953 --> 00:20:44,164
It was fantastic.

271
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,377
It was just the ether, Wilbur.

272
00:21:02,265 --> 00:21:06,519
- Hi.
- Hey, Eddie, look at this.

273
00:21:06,603 --> 00:21:12,192
- Homer, do you ever think about trying to find your parents?
- Not really.

274
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:14,235
Why not?

275
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,739
Well, they never did the things
parents are supposed to do.

276
00:21:17,822 --> 00:21:22,661
Dr Larch did those things and
Nurse Edna and Nurse Angela.

277
00:21:22,744 --> 00:21:26,456
Well, I wish I could meet
mine anyway, sometimes.

278
00:21:27,582 --> 00:21:29,751
What for?

279
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:36,508
Well, I'd like to show 'em
that I could cook a little.

280
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:39,260
- Mm-hmm.
- And...

281
00:21:39,344 --> 00:21:41,429
that I could drive a truck.

282
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:44,724
Mm-hmm.

283
00:21:47,018 --> 00:21:51,940
Sometimes I wanna meet them so I can
kill them. Just sort of kill them.

284
00:22:01,032 --> 00:22:03,868
You know I'd never
kill anyone, right?

285
00:22:03,952 --> 00:22:06,121
- Mm-hmm. I know.
- Get away!

286
00:22:06,204 --> 00:22:08,748
Get the hell off of me!

287
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:11,292
I think Mary Agnes
could kill someone.

288
00:22:11,376 --> 00:22:14,546
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- I don't think so.

289
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:18,216
No, she's... she's just
an emotional girl.

290
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,635
What's she so emotional about?

291
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:24,472
She got left here like the
rest of us, didn't she?

292
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,816
Throw it to Copperfield.

293
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:36,985
I go first.

294
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:39,738
I'll be on Buster's team.

295
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,494
Look!

296
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:48,663
Her temperature is 104.

297
00:22:48,747 --> 00:22:51,458
Scoot down.

298
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:55,170
Come on. Good girl. That's a girl.
Little more.

299
00:22:55,253 --> 00:22:59,007
Dear child, it won't hurt when I look.
I'm just gonna look.

300
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:01,635
All right.

301
00:23:10,101 --> 00:23:12,771
Dear child, did you, uh,
do something to yourself?

302
00:23:12,854 --> 00:23:15,607
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

303
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,193
- Did you go to someone else?
- He said he was a doctor.

304
00:23:18,276 --> 00:23:23,323
- I would never have stuck that inside of me. It wasn't me.
- Listen, you've been very brave.

305
00:23:23,406 --> 00:23:25,784
- I'm going to put you to sleep.
- It wasn't me.

306
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:29,162
Homer, I want you to see this.

307
00:23:29,245 --> 00:23:32,290
You won't feel it any more.

308
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:39,339
You've been very brave.
We'll make it deep.

309
00:23:39,422 --> 00:23:41,508
- You sure?
- You bet.

310
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:45,971
The fetus is unexpelled.
Her uterus is punctured.

311
00:23:46,054 --> 00:23:51,393
She has acute peritonitis, and
there's a foreign object.

312
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:53,603
I think it's a crochet hook.

313
00:23:56,815 --> 00:24:00,568
Take this.

314
00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:04,489
If she had come to you four months
ago and asked for a simple D&C,

315
00:24:04,572 --> 00:24:06,574
what would you have done?

316
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:11,413
Nothing! This is what
doing nothing gets you.

317
00:24:11,496 --> 00:24:15,834
It means that somebody else is gonna do
the job, some moron who doesn't know how.

318
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:22,257
I wish you'd have come
to me, dear child.

319
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:38,106
What did she die of?

320
00:24:38,231 --> 00:24:40,358
She died of secrecy.

321
00:24:40,483 --> 00:24:45,238
- She died of ignorance.
- Oh.

322
00:24:45,363 --> 00:24:49,075
Homer, if you expect people to be
responsible for their children,

323
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,747
you have to give them the right to
decide whether or not to have children.

324
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:57,125
- Wouldn't you agree?
- How about expecting people to be responsible enough...

325
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,294
to control themselves
to begin with?

326
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:02,797
How about this child? You
expect her to be responsible?

327
00:25:02,922 --> 00:25:05,800
I'm not talking about her.

328
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:08,970
I'm talking about adults.

329
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:11,264
You know who I mean.

330
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:19,272
- What?
- It's just... It's just a marvel to me...

331
00:25:19,397 --> 00:25:23,610
that you still have such
high expectations of people.

332
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:27,489
- I'm happy I amuse you.
- Look at it this way.

333
00:25:27,614 --> 00:25:31,451
What choice does Buster have?
What are his options?

334
00:25:31,576 --> 00:25:34,746
- Nobody will ever adopt him.
- Look at it this way.

335
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:39,668
Buster and I are sitting here right beside you.
We could have ended up in the incinerator.

336
00:25:39,793 --> 00:25:44,673
Happy to be alive under any circumstances.
Is that your point?

337
00:25:52,806 --> 00:25:55,350
Happy to be alive?
Yeah, I guess so.

338
00:26:10,907 --> 00:26:15,704
- You're it.
- Pass it over here.

339
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:20,250
- So many children. Are they all orphans?
- Well, it is an orphanage.

340
00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:24,379
- Who wants chocolate?
- I want some chocolate.

341
00:26:24,504 --> 00:26:26,881
Hi. Okay.

342
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:30,510
They're getting in the car.
Watch your fingers.

343
00:26:30,593 --> 00:26:32,721
Hi.

344
00:26:32,846 --> 00:26:35,056
- Hi.
- Hi.

345
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:38,101
- I'm the best.
- You are?

346
00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:40,937
Wow! The best? The best at what?

347
00:26:41,021 --> 00:26:44,941
- I'm the best one.
- The best one, huh?

348
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:47,402
- I'm the best one of all the kids.
- You are?

349
00:26:47,527 --> 00:26:49,571
He seems like the best one.

350
00:26:56,328 --> 00:27:00,248
Well, let's see if we can take
care of that. Can you blow?

351
00:27:00,373 --> 00:27:02,917
I really am the best.
I just have a cold.

352
00:27:03,043 --> 00:27:06,629
Sorry. They're not used to
seeing a car like this.

353
00:27:06,713 --> 00:27:07,964
Ah, it's okay. I don't mind.

354
00:27:08,048 --> 00:27:10,091
Come on.

355
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:12,719
Come on. Let's get out.
Come on now.

356
00:27:12,802 --> 00:27:15,263
- Oh, sure you can. Come on.
- Good morning.

357
00:27:17,223 --> 00:27:19,267
- Morning.
- Dr Larch.

358
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:23,104
- Candy.
- Hi, I'm Wally. I brought some chocolates for the kids.

359
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:26,900
Chocolates? How thoughtful.
Come on, Curly.

360
00:27:30,904 --> 00:27:33,990
- So, Mrs...
- Candy.

361
00:27:34,074 --> 00:27:36,201
Candy Kendall.

362
00:27:36,326 --> 00:27:38,953
Wally. Wally Worthington.

363
00:27:49,923 --> 00:27:52,258
How many months are you?

364
00:27:57,764 --> 00:28:01,977
- Uh, two.
- Two.

365
00:28:05,438 --> 00:28:07,983
Um...

366
00:28:08,108 --> 00:28:11,861
Are you... Are you the...
Are you doing the...

367
00:28:11,945 --> 00:28:14,948
Oh, no. Dr Larch will be
performing the procedure.

368
00:28:15,031 --> 00:28:17,492
- Oh, good.
- Okay.

369
00:28:17,575 --> 00:28:20,704
I was... I was just curious.

370
00:28:20,787 --> 00:28:23,373
Excuse me.

371
00:28:23,456 --> 00:28:26,334
The woman you delivered last
night, she's complaining of pain.

372
00:28:26,418 --> 00:28:29,879
Okay. I'll take a look.
Couple of minutes. Thank you.

373
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:43,643
Are you okay?

374
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:47,480
Yeah. I think it was the ether.

375
00:28:47,564 --> 00:28:51,234
Oh, the... That smell
must've got to me.

376
00:28:52,986 --> 00:28:56,573
Oh, God, this is all my fault.

377
00:28:56,656 --> 00:29:00,160
Homer, Steerforth got into the pantry.
He's eaten all the pie dough.

378
00:29:00,243 --> 00:29:03,663
- He wasn't sharing it either.
- He's down the hall throwing up.

379
00:29:03,747 --> 00:29:07,250
- He's such a pig.
- Don't call him a pig. It's not nice to call people names.

380
00:29:07,334 --> 00:29:09,794
But he is a pig.

381
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:15,508
What kind of planes
do you fly in?

382
00:29:15,592 --> 00:29:17,594
AB-24 Liberator.

383
00:29:17,677 --> 00:29:21,723
Oh. Liberator.

384
00:29:21,806 --> 00:29:25,018
You enlisted?

385
00:29:25,101 --> 00:29:28,605
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class 4.
I have a heart defect.

386
00:29:28,688 --> 00:29:31,232
- Yeah? Is it serious?
- No.

387
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:35,278
No, it's not serious. I'm just
not supposed to get excited.

388
00:29:35,362 --> 00:29:38,448
You know, no strain, no stress. I
try to keep calm all the time.

389
00:29:38,531 --> 00:29:42,285
I can't imagine there's any
strain or stress around here.

390
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:45,205
Yeah.

391
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,129
- How she's doing?
- Just fine.

392
00:29:53,213 --> 00:29:55,548
Good.

393
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,469
Boy or a girl?

394
00:29:59,552 --> 00:30:02,263
- It's all over, dear.
- Yeah, it's all over, honey.

395
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:12,148
I would really like to
have a baby one day.

396
00:30:12,232 --> 00:30:14,275
- I really would.
- Why, of course.

397
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:17,112
You can have as many
children as you want.

398
00:30:17,195 --> 00:30:22,367
- I'm sure you'll have very beautiful children.
- Oh, yes, I'm sure. I'm sure.

399
00:30:24,744 --> 00:30:29,124
You'll have Princes of Maine.
You'll have Kings of New England.

400
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:35,005
Lieutenant, I think you should
find yourself some fresh air.

401
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:50,645
- I still don't feel so good.
- Cut it out, children.

402
00:30:50,729 --> 00:30:53,523
Homer, what's a runt?
Copperfield called me a runt.

403
00:30:53,606 --> 00:30:55,859
He was just kidding, Fuzz.

404
00:30:55,942 --> 00:30:58,653
- Here.
- Orange is my favourite colour.

405
00:30:58,737 --> 00:31:01,656
Should I keep the teeth orange?

406
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,658
Homer, look.

407
00:31:03,742 --> 00:31:06,578
Homer, look, look.

408
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:10,665
Homer, when is Halloween?

409
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:13,460
- It's at the end of October.
- Is that soon?

410
00:31:13,543 --> 00:31:16,713
That's a few months away, Fuzz.

411
00:31:16,796 --> 00:31:21,217
Oh, it's the best time. Homer?

412
00:31:21,301 --> 00:31:25,055
- What is Honolulu?
- Honolulu?

413
00:31:25,138 --> 00:31:27,724
Hmm. It's a city.

414
00:31:27,807 --> 00:31:31,186
Oh. What's the moonlight like?

415
00:31:33,104 --> 00:31:35,315
Well, I've never been there,

416
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:39,653
- but I think that it would probably be very bright.
- Oh.

417
00:31:39,736 --> 00:31:42,238
Why do we get pumpkins
only once a year?

418
00:31:45,158 --> 00:31:47,744
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.

419
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:58,672
Eeew, that's disgusting!
He does this all the time.

420
00:31:58,755 --> 00:32:00,924
Stop it right now.

421
00:32:30,954 --> 00:32:34,457
- Hey.
- Hey. How's she doin'?

422
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:37,085
- Oh, she's fine.
- Good.

423
00:32:39,129 --> 00:32:41,131
Fine.

424
00:32:44,551 --> 00:32:49,055
I... I was wondering if
you could give me a ride?

425
00:32:49,139 --> 00:32:51,308
Sure.

426
00:32:51,391 --> 00:32:55,145
I'd be glad to.
Uh, a ride where?

427
00:32:55,228 --> 00:32:56,980
Where you goin'?

428
00:32:57,063 --> 00:32:59,649
We're headin' back
to Cape Kenneth.

429
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:03,903
Cape Kenneth? That sounds fine.

430
00:33:05,238 --> 00:33:07,449
Okay.

431
00:33:19,377 --> 00:33:22,464
Doubtless you will let me know
what immensely worthwhile...

432
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:26,176
or at least useful thing
that it is you find to do.

433
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:29,012
I wasn't intending to leave
here to be entirely useless.

434
00:33:29,095 --> 00:33:32,932
I expect I'll find some
other way to be of use.

435
00:33:33,016 --> 00:33:37,187
- In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
- Of course.

436
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:41,524
Are you so stupid you imagine you're
going to find a more gratifying life?

437
00:33:41,608 --> 00:33:44,527
What you will find is people like
the poor people who get left here.

438
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:49,366
Only nobody takes care of them half as well.
You won't be able to take care of them either.

439
00:33:49,449 --> 00:33:54,371
There's no taking care of
anybody, not out there.

440
00:33:54,454 --> 00:33:58,291
You know I'm grateful for
everything that you've done for me.

441
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:02,879
- I don't need your gratitude.
- I don't need this. I know all about my condition.

442
00:34:02,962 --> 00:34:06,883
It's your heart. You ought
to take it with you.

443
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:19,896
Going where? Does he have
a plan of some kind?

444
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,692
- Will he be back soon?
- I don't know. He's just leaving.

445
00:34:23,775 --> 00:34:26,736
You were the one who says
he needs to see the world.

446
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,240
- That's what he'll do, is see the world.
- He's leaving.

447
00:34:30,323 --> 00:34:35,078
- He'll need clothes. He'll need some money.
- Let him try to make some money.

448
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:37,539
That's part of seeing
the world, isn't it?

449
00:34:37,622 --> 00:34:41,126
Oh, Wilbur, stop it. You knew this was
going to happen. He's a young man.

450
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:45,588
He's still a boy.

451
00:34:45,672 --> 00:34:49,259
Out in the world,

452
00:34:49,342 --> 00:34:51,761
he's still a boy.

453
00:34:51,845 --> 00:34:55,932
Just find him some
clothes, Wilbur.

454
00:34:56,016 --> 00:34:58,643
He could use some clothes.

455
00:35:24,878 --> 00:35:27,964
Homer.

456
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:31,551
Copperfield. It'll be all right.

457
00:35:31,635 --> 00:35:36,640
Children, up on the porch.
Up, up.

458
00:35:36,723 --> 00:35:39,976
Say goodbye. Wave from here.

459
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:47,067
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye, Homer.

460
00:35:55,241 --> 00:35:57,619
Bye, Homer.

461
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:01,456
Come on.

462
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,436
- I can walk. Put me down.
- Nope. I wanna carry you.

463
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,649
- No, it's okay.
- Here, let me get this.

464
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:30,694
Wally, put me down.

465
00:36:30,777 --> 00:36:33,279
Okay. Okay.

466
00:36:34,572 --> 00:36:37,117
Hey.

467
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,870
Coming with us? That's good.

468
00:36:40,954 --> 00:36:43,498
You never know when you're
gonna need a doctor.

469
00:36:43,581 --> 00:36:46,167
- Do you want me to put the top up?
- No.

470
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:49,295
- You might get cold.
- I want some fresh air.

471
00:36:57,053 --> 00:36:59,347
She'll be just fine.

472
00:37:03,685 --> 00:37:06,396
Is he gonna come out?

473
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:19,242
- Bye, Homer.
- Bye, Curly.

474
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:22,245
Sorry I have to go.

475
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:26,041
It's not fair. You're too old.

476
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:37,969
I couldn't find Buster. Maybe
you could tell him that l...

477
00:37:49,856 --> 00:37:53,276
- Bye, Homer!
- Don't go too far!

478
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:55,695
Homer, bye!

479
00:37:57,322 --> 00:37:59,407
Hey, Homer!

480
00:38:33,274 --> 00:38:35,568
Let us be happy for Homer Wells.

481
00:38:35,694 --> 00:38:38,613
Homer has found a family.

482
00:38:38,738 --> 00:38:41,199
Aren't we all happy for Homer?

483
00:38:41,282 --> 00:38:45,328
- Yes.
- Good night, Homer.

484
00:38:45,412 --> 00:38:47,706
Good night, Homer.

485
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,670
Good night, Homer.

486
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:49,225
Actually, the army's
given me leave twice.

487
00:39:49,309 --> 00:39:52,687
First, when my father died. And now I'm
on leave to help my mom with the harvest.

488
00:39:52,771 --> 00:39:55,065
She's no farmer. Apples
were my dad's business,

489
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,109
but with the war on
she's short of pickers.

490
00:39:58,193 --> 00:40:01,863
- Wally thinks apples are boring.
- I never said they were boring.

491
00:40:01,988 --> 00:40:05,575
Yes, you did. You said apples
weren't exactly flying.

492
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,621
- They aren't.
- I think I would like the apple business.

493
00:40:09,704 --> 00:40:12,457
- You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
- No.

494
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,795
- No, not really. I need a job.
- Where are you headed?

495
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:19,631
- I don't know.
- What are you gonna do?

496
00:40:19,714 --> 00:40:21,966
I don't know.

497
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:26,137
Is your family in the apple
business too, Candy?

498
00:40:26,221 --> 00:40:29,099
No. But I work there. I like it.

499
00:40:29,182 --> 00:40:31,309
My dad's a lobster man.

500
00:40:31,393 --> 00:40:33,937
- Oh, wow.
- Mm-hmm.

501
00:40:35,855 --> 00:40:38,984
I've never actually
seen a lobster.

502
00:40:39,985 --> 00:40:42,612
Are you serious?

503
00:40:42,696 --> 00:40:44,823
I've never seen
the ocean either.

504
00:40:44,906 --> 00:40:48,118
You... You've never
seen the ocean?

505
00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:50,829
That's not funny.
That's serious.

506
00:41:44,257 --> 00:41:46,468
It's beautiful.

507
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:50,680
Yeah.

508
00:41:54,142 --> 00:41:56,311
Do you have cramps?

509
00:41:59,481 --> 00:42:01,983
They'll ease up soon.

510
00:42:02,067 --> 00:42:05,403
As long as the bleeding
isn't heavy, it's normal,

511
00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:07,906
it should taper off tomorrow.

512
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:10,617
Catch!

513
00:42:12,327 --> 00:42:14,329
All right.

514
00:42:14,412 --> 00:42:16,414
- Throw it back.
- Okay.

515
00:42:16,498 --> 00:42:18,750
All right!

516
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:22,754
Put your fingers on the laces.

517
00:42:22,837 --> 00:42:25,090
Here's China. Here's India.

518
00:42:25,173 --> 00:42:29,177
- Mm-hmm.
- Seven-hour round trip flight. It's called the "Burma run."

519
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,764
And this part's called "Flying over
the hump." These are the Himalayas.

520
00:42:32,847 --> 00:42:35,266
How high do you fly there?

521
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:39,562
Well, I have to fly 15,000 feet
within the first 35 minutes.

522
00:42:39,646 --> 00:42:42,232
Otherwise we won't make it
over the first mountain.

523
00:42:42,315 --> 00:42:45,235
- They got the worst air currents in the world.
- Dangerous, huh?

524
00:42:45,318 --> 00:42:49,447
Yeah. Actually, I volunteered.

525
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:52,575
Did you really?

526
00:42:55,787 --> 00:42:59,624
Hey, look. If you're serious about wanting
a job, picking apples isn't that boring.

527
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:03,420
Yeah? Oh, I would
love that, Wally.

528
00:43:08,717 --> 00:43:11,636
- See you around, Homer.
- Oh, yeah.

529
00:43:14,389 --> 00:43:17,892
- Thank you, for everything.
- Mm-hmm.

530
00:43:24,316 --> 00:43:26,318
Hi, Sam.

531
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:31,489
Hi, Dad!

532
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:58,433
Come on. You're
gonna meet my mom.

533
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:06,274
By the way, I've been at
a wedding, all right?

534
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:09,527
If it comes up, that's where
I met you, at the wedding.

535
00:44:18,036 --> 00:44:20,330
Wally? Wally, is that you?

536
00:44:20,413 --> 00:44:24,668
Mom, this is Homer Wells.

537
00:44:24,751 --> 00:44:27,379
- How do you do, Homer?
- Oh, good. How do you do?

538
00:44:27,462 --> 00:44:31,549
He's the most overqualified apple picker
you'll ever meet, but he's dying to learn.

539
00:44:31,633 --> 00:44:34,469
Really? Were you a friend
of the groom's, Homer?

540
00:44:34,552 --> 00:44:37,722
Homer's a friend of the groom's,
the bride's, everyone. Come on.

541
00:44:37,806 --> 00:44:41,851
In that case, maybe you'd like
to stay to dinner, Homer?

542
00:44:41,935 --> 00:44:45,230
- Another time, Mom.
- You gotta meet Mr Rose.

543
00:44:45,313 --> 00:44:47,732
You used up all the hot water!

544
00:44:47,816 --> 00:44:50,068
- You're usin' my soap, ain't you?
- I ain't usin' no soap.

545
00:45:01,621 --> 00:45:03,665
They're migrants.

546
00:45:03,748 --> 00:45:07,836
They pick the fruit. All kinds.

547
00:45:07,919 --> 00:45:10,922
They travel up and down the
coast with the seasons.

548
00:45:11,006 --> 00:45:14,175
The trick to Mr Rose is you
have to let him be boss.

549
00:45:14,259 --> 00:45:16,386
Oh, excuse me.

550
00:45:16,469 --> 00:45:19,597
- The sink's backed up again, Wally.
- Not again.

551
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:22,726
- Thought you said you was gonna get us a plumber.
- Rose, this is Homer.

552
00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:26,604
- Homer, this is Mr Rose's daughter, Rose.
- You a plumber?

553
00:45:26,688 --> 00:45:30,025
Homer's the new picker. He's
gonna stay here with you.

554
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,072
- He's stayin' here?
- Yeah.

555
00:45:36,156 --> 00:45:38,241
Uh-oh.

556
00:45:38,325 --> 00:45:42,579
This daughter of mine, she's just
Miss Hospitality, ain't she, Wally?

557
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:51,254
New picker? You got lots
of experience, I expect.

558
00:45:51,338 --> 00:45:53,298
Homer's got no
experience, Arthur,

559
00:45:53,381 --> 00:45:56,092
but he's smarter than I am
and he's a fast learner.

560
00:45:56,176 --> 00:45:58,762
Mr Rose is gonna teach
you the apple business.

561
00:45:58,845 --> 00:46:02,140
Well, I believe this is history.

562
00:46:02,223 --> 00:46:05,143
We're makin' history,
Wally, ain't we?

563
00:46:05,226 --> 00:46:08,104
We're makin' history havin'
this young man stay with us.

564
00:46:10,565 --> 00:46:14,277
Why don't you show him around?

565
00:46:22,243 --> 00:46:24,788
Your name is Rose Rose?

566
00:46:24,871 --> 00:46:26,956
- Pretty, ain't it?
- Very.

567
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,753
- You like to read?
- I really can't read that good.

568
00:46:38,885 --> 00:46:43,932
Homer, what does this say? Here.

569
00:46:49,854 --> 00:46:52,649
"I looked at the stars
and considered...

570
00:46:52,732 --> 00:46:56,152
"how awful it would be for a man
to turn his face to them...

571
00:46:56,236 --> 00:47:00,115
"and he froze to death and
see no help or pity...

572
00:47:00,198 --> 00:47:02,617
in all the glittering
multitude."

573
00:47:02,701 --> 00:47:05,286
More.

574
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:07,872
Since you the one...

575
00:47:07,956 --> 00:47:10,208
who's smart enough to read,

576
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:12,377
what's this here?

577
00:47:22,137 --> 00:47:25,807
- It's a list of rules it seems.
- Whose rules?

578
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:28,059
I imagine they're
for us, I suppose.

579
00:47:28,143 --> 00:47:31,146
Go on then. Read 'em, Homer.

580
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,941
"One: Please don't
smoke in bed."

581
00:47:38,987 --> 00:47:42,073
It's too late for that one.
Keep reading, Homer.

582
00:47:42,157 --> 00:47:46,202
"Two: Please don't operate the grinder
or press if you've been drinking."

583
00:47:46,286 --> 00:47:49,080
You know, they ain't
our rules, Homer.

584
00:47:49,164 --> 00:47:52,542
We didn't write 'em. I don't
see no need to read 'em.

585
00:47:53,668 --> 00:47:55,628
Okay.

586
00:48:04,262 --> 00:48:07,557
Good night, you
Princes of Maine,

587
00:48:07,641 --> 00:48:09,809
you Kings of New England.

588
00:48:34,709 --> 00:48:37,128
Hoo! Remember this.

589
00:48:37,212 --> 00:48:41,800
In the morning when the grass
is wet, you can make it slide.

590
00:48:43,969 --> 00:48:46,763
- Feel it?
- Yeah.

591
00:48:46,846 --> 00:48:50,266
It's almost like flying.

592
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:53,478
Watch out for the trees.

593
00:48:53,561 --> 00:48:55,814
Trees are flak,
antiaircraft fire...

594
00:48:55,897 --> 00:48:58,650
from the geeks on the ground.

595
00:49:09,995 --> 00:49:12,622
- Hey, Homer.
- Hi.

596
00:49:12,706 --> 00:49:15,500
I was just showin'
Homer the orchard.

597
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:18,086
- Kind of a geography lesson.
- Really?

598
00:49:18,169 --> 00:49:20,922
- Yeah.
- What's that?

599
00:49:21,006 --> 00:49:25,468
- What?
- This, here. Looks like you've been giving him flying lessons.

600
00:49:25,552 --> 00:49:28,138
Ah, he loved it. Didn't you?

601
00:49:30,265 --> 00:49:32,684
Wally here thinks people like
being whacked by branches.

602
00:49:32,767 --> 00:49:36,813
- Oh, I liked it.
- Really?

603
00:49:36,938 --> 00:49:39,607
Yeah!

604
00:49:41,318 --> 00:49:43,862
- You're unbelievable.
- Well, thank you very much.

605
00:50:05,342 --> 00:50:07,886
Hey! What's wrong with you?

606
00:50:08,011 --> 00:50:11,890
Sorry.

607
00:50:12,015 --> 00:50:16,227
That's Vernon. You better stay away from
him till he gets to know you better.

608
00:50:16,353 --> 00:50:20,023
- Then you best stay away from him even more.
- - Homer.

609
00:50:21,858 --> 00:50:24,527
Lieutenant's calling you. You
better watch your ass, Homer.

610
00:50:24,653 --> 00:50:26,571
Hey, Wally.

611
00:50:26,696 --> 00:50:28,698
- You gettin' along okay?
- Yeah.

612
00:50:33,328 --> 00:50:35,747
- Guess what.
- What?

613
00:50:35,872 --> 00:50:38,541
I'm shippin' out today.

614
00:50:38,667 --> 00:50:40,877
It's a little sooner
than I expected, but...

615
00:50:41,002 --> 00:50:46,424
I wanted to make sure that you're
settled and happy enough considering...

616
00:50:46,508 --> 00:50:49,177
Are you bored stiff or do you
think you can stick it out a bit?

617
00:50:49,302 --> 00:50:52,472
Yeah, of course. I'm
grateful for the job, Wally.

618
00:50:52,555 --> 00:50:55,725
I'm grateful too. It gives me peace of mind
knowin' you're here keepin' an eye on things.

619
00:50:55,809 --> 00:50:58,228
- Well, that's good.
- You about ready, Homer?

620
00:50:58,353 --> 00:51:00,563
Yeah.

621
00:51:00,647 --> 00:51:04,859
- Uh, look, Wally, thanks. I'm lucky I met you.
- I'm the lucky one.

622
00:51:04,985 --> 00:51:07,320
- No, really, I'm lucky.
- Do you wanna fight about it?

623
00:51:08,738 --> 00:51:11,908
- Kidding.
- Oh, okay.

624
00:51:11,992 --> 00:51:14,119
- Take care of yourself.
- Okay.

625
00:51:14,202 --> 00:51:16,162
Bye.

626
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:19,541
Okay, Mr Rose.

627
00:51:47,402 --> 00:51:50,488
Turn. That's right.
Turn and pull.

628
00:51:50,572 --> 00:51:54,159
Turn and pull. Just like that.
Good. Good.

629
00:51:54,242 --> 00:51:57,495
Okay, that's good. Right now you're
pickin' mostly cider apples.

630
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,540
All these drops here,
they good only for cider.

631
00:52:00,623 --> 00:52:03,460
And you're picking apples with
the stem only half the time.

632
00:52:03,543 --> 00:52:06,463
Golden rule, Homer. You wanna
pick the apple with the stem.

633
00:52:06,546 --> 00:52:10,634
Now, see that there? The
spur right above the stem?

634
00:52:10,717 --> 00:52:13,887
That's the bud for next year's apple.
That's called the "spur."

635
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:16,264
Pick the spur, you're
pickin' two years in one.

636
00:52:16,389 --> 00:52:20,310
You're pickin' next year's apple before it have
a chance to grow. So you wanna leave that.

637
00:52:20,393 --> 00:52:23,063
- Okay.
- All right, let me see you work.

638
00:52:24,814 --> 00:52:27,692
Yeah. That's good.

639
00:52:29,653 --> 00:52:31,738
Yeah, that's much better.
That's better.

640
00:52:31,821 --> 00:52:34,199
I can see you got
yourself some education.

641
00:52:34,324 --> 00:52:37,243
Them good hands you got.

642
00:52:37,327 --> 00:52:40,705
Them hands you got, they know what
they're doin'. Ain't that right?

643
00:52:40,789 --> 00:52:44,542
- I guess so.
- All right.

644
00:52:44,626 --> 00:52:48,254
- You keep on workin', Homer. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

645
00:52:48,338 --> 00:52:50,799
Wilbur? Wilbur?

646
00:52:52,509 --> 00:52:55,887
Wilbur? You should read this.

647
00:52:55,971 --> 00:52:58,098
It's from the board.
Another letter.

648
00:52:58,181 --> 00:53:03,103
"Merely suggesting that some new
blood might benefit you all.

649
00:53:03,186 --> 00:53:06,690
Someone with new ideas in the
obstetrical and paediatric fields."

650
00:53:06,773 --> 00:53:10,610
I think they're just testing
some ideas for our next meeting.

651
00:53:10,694 --> 00:53:14,781
Dr Holtz seems nice. I think
he only wants to help.

652
00:53:14,864 --> 00:53:19,452
He's a goddam psychiatrist!
Of course he wants to help.

653
00:53:19,536 --> 00:53:21,746
He'd be happy to
help to commit me.

654
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:24,416
It's this Mrs Goodhall you
have to be careful of, Wilbur.

655
00:53:24,499 --> 00:53:27,293
We have to be more than
careful of Mrs Goodhall.

656
00:53:27,377 --> 00:53:31,047
She has enough Christian zeal
to start her own country.

657
00:53:32,632 --> 00:53:35,552
I'd like to give her
a little ether.

658
00:53:35,635 --> 00:53:38,221
- So, what are you going to do?
- Take this.

659
00:53:41,391 --> 00:53:46,479
Homer Wells, born Portland,
Maine, March 2, 1915.

660
00:53:46,563 --> 00:53:48,773
But Homer was born here.

661
00:53:48,857 --> 00:53:51,735
- In what was it? 1922?
- Mm-hmm.

662
00:53:51,818 --> 00:53:55,447
Graduated Bowdoin College, 1935.

663
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:58,116
Harvard School of
Medicine, 1939.

664
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:01,328
- That's you, Wilbur. You went there.
- An internship,

665
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:06,499
and two years of training at the
Boston Lying-In, South End Branch,

666
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:09,336
he was judged an accomplished
gynaecological...

667
00:54:09,419 --> 00:54:12,088
- and obstetrical surgeon...
- That's not him.

668
00:54:12,172 --> 00:54:14,674
With experience in
paediatric care.

669
00:54:14,758 --> 00:54:16,926
Wilbur, you're making this up.

670
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:21,348
Angela, the board is
going to replace me.

671
00:54:21,431 --> 00:54:24,434
That is what the
new blood is for.

672
00:54:24,517 --> 00:54:28,521
You mean they're going to replace you with
someone who doesn't perform abortions.

673
00:54:28,605 --> 00:54:31,858
Well, we can only guess at that.
They are against the law.

674
00:54:31,941 --> 00:54:34,486
These credentials are
against the law.

675
00:54:34,569 --> 00:54:39,199
We all know I trained Homer, so his
credentials are as good as mine.

676
00:54:39,282 --> 00:54:42,202
And don't be holy to
me about the law.

677
00:54:42,285 --> 00:54:44,579
What has the law ever
done for anyone here?

678
00:54:46,122 --> 00:54:49,793
So, what do you think
about my candidate?

679
00:54:49,876 --> 00:54:54,255
What about school records? Homer
doesn't have any diplomas.

680
00:54:55,548 --> 00:54:58,843
Come here, Edna, please.
Come here.

681
00:55:05,767 --> 00:55:08,144
He will have them.

682
00:55:08,228 --> 00:55:10,855
Wilbur!

683
00:55:10,939 --> 00:55:13,108
I don't know...

684
00:55:16,653 --> 00:55:18,822
All of these on there, okay.

685
00:55:18,905 --> 00:55:21,032
- Gotta pack 'em tight now, y'all.
- I got it.

686
00:55:21,116 --> 00:55:23,076
What do you think we do?

687
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:26,579
- All aboard, Mrs Worthington.
- Thank you, Arthur.

688
00:55:26,663 --> 00:55:29,582
How's this crew this year?
Got any rotten apples?

689
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:31,710
- It's a good crew, ma'am.
- Hey, Rose Rose.

690
00:55:31,793 --> 00:55:34,254
- You tryin' to break my finger? Damn!
- Just an accident.

691
00:55:34,337 --> 00:55:37,173
Excuse me.

692
00:55:37,257 --> 00:55:42,220
Well, maybe we got one bad apple,
but it's nothing we can't handle.

693
00:55:42,304 --> 00:55:44,097
I see.

694
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,766
How's young Homer working out?

695
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,852
- Good. He's a smart young man.
- Hey, Homer.

696
00:55:48,935 --> 00:55:51,730
- Wally was right about him. Real hard worker.
- Good.

697
00:55:51,813 --> 00:55:54,190
Mornin', Miss Worthington.

698
00:55:54,274 --> 00:55:58,445
Why don't you come up and visit me at the house?
I know I've got clothes that will fit you.

699
00:55:58,528 --> 00:56:01,239
- Okay.
- I'm sure I can find a ton of things to fit you.

700
00:56:01,323 --> 00:56:05,285
Rose don't really need any
more pickin' clothes, ma'am.

701
00:56:05,368 --> 00:56:08,538
- Uh-huh.
- Now don't be a party-pooper, Arthur.

702
00:56:08,621 --> 00:56:11,791
I have a beautiful blouse...

703
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:14,461
- Hey, Rose Rose.
- Homer.

704
00:56:14,544 --> 00:56:16,629
- Hey.
- Hi.

705
00:56:16,713 --> 00:56:19,632
How you feelin'?

706
00:56:19,716 --> 00:56:22,636
When I'm not thinking
of Wally, I'm fine.

707
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:26,097
I'm not really good
at being alone.

708
00:56:28,642 --> 00:56:31,811
Oh.

709
00:56:31,895 --> 00:56:34,606
Feeling much better. Thanks.

710
00:56:36,816 --> 00:56:38,943
Hey, listen.

711
00:56:39,027 --> 00:56:43,865
Maybe if you're free, you'd like to
come and have dinner at my dad's place?

712
00:56:46,201 --> 00:56:50,455
- Okay.
- You haven't seen a lobster yet, have you?

713
00:56:50,538 --> 00:56:53,291
- No.
- Oh, good.

714
00:57:08,765 --> 00:57:10,767
You're hungry, right?

715
00:57:27,283 --> 00:57:30,662
- What is that?
- - It's a drive-in movie theatre.

716
00:57:30,745 --> 00:57:32,706
- It's a movie outside?
- Yeah.

717
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:34,791
- Oh, can we see it?
- Okay.

718
00:57:43,133 --> 00:57:46,720
- It's closed now because of the blackouts.
- Oh.

719
00:57:47,929 --> 00:57:50,890
It's so big.

720
00:57:50,974 --> 00:57:53,393
You smoke? You want a cigarette?

721
00:57:53,476 --> 00:57:56,062
Okay.

722
00:57:59,607 --> 00:58:03,820
Wally would kill me if
he saw me doin' this.

723
00:58:11,244 --> 00:58:14,039
- There you go.
- Thanks.

724
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:18,585
So, you like movies?

725
00:58:18,668 --> 00:58:21,171
Yes. Seen only one, though.

726
00:58:24,007 --> 00:58:27,052
You've seen only one? Which one?

727
00:58:27,135 --> 00:58:30,847
Uh, King Kong. It's really good.

728
00:58:47,614 --> 00:58:49,616
Mmm. Oh.

729
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:53,620
Wilbur, it's a pie apple. Here, look.
See? Try one of those.

730
00:58:53,703 --> 00:58:56,998
So he's an apple
expert now, is he?

731
00:58:59,876 --> 00:59:03,630
Oh, my, yes. That's a
far superior taste.

732
00:59:03,713 --> 00:59:05,715
And crisp too.

733
00:59:05,799 --> 00:59:08,301
So many apples are
disappointingly mealy.

734
00:59:08,385 --> 00:59:11,054
Wilbur, he picked
these for us himself.

735
00:59:11,137 --> 00:59:17,060
You don't find it depressing that
Homer Wells is picking apples?

736
00:59:17,143 --> 00:59:19,312
Or that he can't be bothered
to write us a proper letter?

737
00:59:19,396 --> 00:59:22,273
Wilbur, it's a gift.

738
00:59:22,357 --> 00:59:25,318
I'll show him a gift.

739
00:59:25,402 --> 00:59:27,988
I'll send him a gift he can use.

740
00:59:31,574 --> 00:59:34,744
There goes Jimmy Stewart
on his way to enlist.

741
00:59:34,828 --> 00:59:37,414
One of the most popular
stars on the screen.

742
00:59:37,497 --> 00:59:40,250
Today he's Lieutenant
Stewart, U.S.A.

743
00:59:47,257 --> 00:59:50,844
Crossing the equator, there's a lighter
side, as novices are introduced...

744
00:59:50,927 --> 00:59:54,014
to the traditional
realm of King Neptune.

745
00:59:54,097 --> 00:59:58,935
Boxing matches, helping relieve the
monotony of long, weary days at sea.

746
01:00:20,623 --> 01:00:22,876
Well, it looked
like you liked it.

747
01:00:22,959 --> 01:00:26,046
I did like it. All I said
was, it's no King Kong.

748
01:00:26,129 --> 01:00:30,842
I mean, first she loved him, then she
didn't. Then no one else could have him.

749
01:00:30,925 --> 01:00:34,596
No, but she did love him. How
many women have you known?

750
01:00:36,306 --> 01:00:40,143
And what did she die of exactly?

751
01:00:40,226 --> 01:00:44,731
She was torn apart. She
died of a broken heart.

752
01:00:44,814 --> 01:00:48,068
Oh. Well, I just...

753
01:00:48,151 --> 01:00:50,945
I need a better
medical explanation.

754
01:00:52,947 --> 01:00:57,619
Torn apart. At least King
Kong, he knew what he wanted.

755
01:01:00,664 --> 01:01:03,667
Hey, what you doin'
with that Candy, Homer?

756
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:07,754
Makin' history, I suppose.

757
01:01:07,837 --> 01:01:11,925
- You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
- No trouble.

758
01:01:12,008 --> 01:01:16,513
That Candy, she's the
nicest girl I know.

759
01:01:16,596 --> 01:01:21,267
She's about the most beautiful girl I've ever
seen, but I don't know if she's the nicest.

760
01:01:21,351 --> 01:01:25,063
She's the nicest and most
beautiful girl I've ever known.

761
01:01:25,146 --> 01:01:27,774
See, that sounds like you
in trouble already, Homer.

762
01:01:27,857 --> 01:01:29,943
Sounds like big
trouble to me, Homer.

763
01:01:32,696 --> 01:01:35,740
- I'm not in trouble.
- Yeah, you is.

764
01:01:35,824 --> 01:01:38,368
I know when people
are in trouble.

765
01:01:38,451 --> 01:01:40,453
You is.

766
01:01:40,578 --> 01:01:42,455
His name is Homer Wells,

767
01:01:42,539 --> 01:01:46,376
and his pathetic resume
is the best I've seen.

768
01:01:46,459 --> 01:01:50,296
I find it hard to believe that the board
would be interested in this character.

769
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,716
But he looks like an
excellent young man.

770
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,302
A first-rate candidate.
Don't you think?

771
01:01:55,385 --> 01:01:58,305
He looks like a bleeding heart
missionary moron to me.

772
01:01:58,388 --> 01:02:01,641
But that would be the problem with any
doctor interested in coming here.

773
01:02:01,725 --> 01:02:04,311
- Do you know him?
- No, and I don't want to.

774
01:02:04,394 --> 01:02:06,604
He's doing missionary
work in India.

775
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:11,943
I wrote to him weeks ago, but either
he's too holy or too busy to answer.

776
01:02:12,068 --> 01:02:14,988
Tomboy!

777
01:02:16,865 --> 01:02:20,368
Sorry. Okay. Come on.

778
01:02:21,911 --> 01:02:24,748
I fail to see how someone
courageous enough...

779
01:02:24,873 --> 01:02:28,585
to make a commitment to a foreign mission
is automatically to be dismissed.

780
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:33,298
That part of the world requires precisely
the kind of dedication that is needed here.

781
01:02:33,506 --> 01:02:35,717
Does it snow in Bombay?

782
01:02:35,842 --> 01:02:39,262
One winter here and we'll be
shipping him south in a coffin!

783
01:02:39,387 --> 01:02:41,681
But Dr Larch, he seems
exceptionally qualified.

784
01:02:41,806 --> 01:02:44,392
I'm not talking about his
medical qualifications.

785
01:02:44,517 --> 01:02:49,606
It's the Christian thing that bothers me. I just
don't see it as being much use around here.

786
01:02:49,731 --> 01:02:53,693
I fail to see how a little
Christianity could hurt anyone here.

787
01:02:55,403 --> 01:02:58,948
Anyway, I was just showing you
this guy as an example...

788
01:02:59,074 --> 01:03:01,034
of what's available.

789
01:03:01,159 --> 01:03:05,372
- I didn't think you'd be interested.
- We're very interested.

790
01:03:05,497 --> 01:03:09,793
- Oh, yes, very.
- You wouldn't be opposed to meeting with him?

791
01:03:11,086 --> 01:03:14,464
Well, it wouldn't
hurt to meet him.

792
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:18,134
- What's his name again?
- Dr Homer Wells.

793
01:03:18,259 --> 01:03:21,888
- It's a nice name. Very New England.
- Very Maine.

794
01:03:22,013 --> 01:03:24,140
A very local sounding name.

795
01:03:24,224 --> 01:03:26,184
Very.

796
01:03:30,605 --> 01:03:33,525
I told you. If I
appear to want it,

797
01:03:33,608 --> 01:03:35,652
they don't want it.

798
01:03:35,735 --> 01:03:38,989
If I appear to hate it,
they just gotta have it.

799
01:03:41,241 --> 01:03:44,411
- Excuse me. I just wanna ask you something.
- Edna, come dance with me.

800
01:03:44,536 --> 01:03:47,080
Let's be foolish tonight.
Come on.

801
01:03:47,205 --> 01:03:51,751
Does he know he's supposed to be in India?
Does he even want to come back?

802
01:03:51,876 --> 01:03:54,254
He's a field hand!

803
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:58,133
What could possibly
hold him there?

804
01:04:01,636 --> 01:04:04,389
Homer! It's time to go!

805
01:04:04,472 --> 01:04:08,393
- Oh, I gotta go.
- Okay.

806
01:04:08,476 --> 01:04:14,149
Right now, we're usin' them
early Macs and Gravensteins.

807
01:04:14,232 --> 01:04:18,069
Cider is way too watery, man. We
ain't gonna get no good cider...

808
01:04:18,153 --> 01:04:21,823
till we start pickin' them Golden
Delicious and Winter Bananas...

809
01:04:21,948 --> 01:04:24,701
and Russets and
Baldwins, you know.

810
01:04:37,005 --> 01:04:39,924
What about worms? Don't
the drops have worms?

811
01:04:40,008 --> 01:04:44,512
Well, yeah, they got worms, Homer.
That ain't nothin' but protein, man.

812
01:04:46,806 --> 01:04:49,559
Jack?

813
01:04:49,643 --> 01:04:52,520
What the hell is you doin', man?

814
01:04:52,604 --> 01:04:56,733
Don't you know that cigarette's gonna ruin
this whole batch of cider? I can't have that.

815
01:04:56,816 --> 01:05:00,236
You gonna have to get that out of there.
You're gonna have to go fishin', boy.

816
01:05:00,362 --> 01:05:02,906
- You mean swimmin'?
- Swimmin' or fishin'.

817
01:05:02,989 --> 01:05:06,076
I ain't goin' in that vat
to fish out no cigarette.

818
01:05:09,329 --> 01:05:12,082
Now, Jack...

819
01:05:12,165 --> 01:05:14,376
Come on down here, man

820
01:05:32,018 --> 01:05:34,187
What business are you in, Jack?

821
01:05:36,398 --> 01:05:39,275
Just tell me what
business you're in.

822
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:44,072
Just say you're in the apple business 'cause
that's the only business you wanna be in.

823
01:05:49,828 --> 01:05:53,832
Hey, Jack! Listen, Jack! You don't wanna go
in the knife business with Mr Rose, man.

824
01:05:53,915 --> 01:05:57,168
- What you wanna do?
- Just tell him you're in the apple business!

825
01:05:57,252 --> 01:05:59,504
- What you wanna do? What you want, man?
- Jack!

826
01:05:59,587 --> 01:06:03,091
- Tell him you in the apple business, boy!
- - It ain't worth it.

827
01:06:03,174 --> 01:06:06,720
- Shut up, Peaches!
- What you want?

828
01:06:12,434 --> 01:06:16,187
Now, I'm in the knife
business, Jack.

829
01:06:16,271 --> 01:06:18,481
I'm in the knife business!

830
01:06:18,565 --> 01:06:22,944
Let me tell ya, you don't wanna be in
no kind of knife business with me.

831
01:06:23,028 --> 01:06:25,697
Now I think it's time
for you to go fishin'.

832
01:06:29,617 --> 01:06:31,995
He kind of fast, ain't he, Jack?

833
01:06:32,078 --> 01:06:36,416
Well, the good news is, you're
already half undressed for swimmin'.

834
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:41,546
Shoot, that Jack too
slow to get me.

835
01:06:41,629 --> 01:06:44,007
I was so fast I cut my own self.

836
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:46,343
You really showed him, huh?

837
01:06:46,426 --> 01:06:49,012
You just about cut
your hand off.

838
01:06:49,095 --> 01:06:51,348
And all you cut off
him was his clothes.

839
01:06:51,431 --> 01:06:56,394
Now you know and I know you don't go to
nobody's jail for cuttin' a guy's clothes off.

840
01:06:56,478 --> 01:06:59,731
Ain't that right? Rose
Rose, ain't that right?

841
01:06:59,814 --> 01:07:02,067
- Oooh.
- Ain't that right, Homer?

842
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:05,987
Easy, easy. Okay. Jus...

843
01:07:06,071 --> 01:07:07,864
Aaah! God...

844
01:07:10,617 --> 01:07:12,535
Not too much gas. There you go.

845
01:07:12,619 --> 01:07:14,829
You wanna go right in here.
Okay, okay, okay!

846
01:07:14,913 --> 01:07:18,625
Slow on the gas. You
really have to be gentle.

847
01:07:19,834 --> 01:07:21,920
That's the one. That's the one.

848
01:07:22,003 --> 01:07:24,255
We wanna stay right there.
Got it?

849
01:07:26,007 --> 01:07:28,802
Slowly, slowly, slowly.
Okay, okay, okay!

850
01:07:28,885 --> 01:07:32,681
You're a natural. You were
born to drive a car like this.

851
01:07:32,764 --> 01:07:36,726
- You think so?
- Yeah. So this is a speaker.

852
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:39,229
This is where the sound
for the movie comes out.

853
01:07:39,312 --> 01:07:42,399
Oh. I love this place.

854
01:07:42,607 --> 01:07:44,985
This is, uh... Have you
seen a lot of movies here?

855
01:07:45,068 --> 01:07:47,612
Yes and no.

856
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:50,657
When you come here, you don't
really care about the movie.

857
01:07:51,992 --> 01:07:53,994
You don't care about the movie?

858
01:07:54,077 --> 01:07:57,831
What are you so crazy
about movies for?

859
01:07:57,914 --> 01:08:02,460
Ah... That was my favourite night
at the orphanage. Movie night.

860
01:08:02,544 --> 01:08:06,756
We'd all... We'd all race
into the dining hall,

861
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,634
and, of course, everyone
wanted to sit in front.

862
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:14,389
So we'd be packed in so tight you could
feel the kid next to you breathing.

863
01:08:18,935 --> 01:08:21,354
You don't miss it?

864
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,692
I miss things. I miss people.

865
01:08:25,775 --> 01:08:28,028
I miss reading to the boys.

866
01:08:31,531 --> 01:08:33,825
You had so much
responsibility, huh?

867
01:08:33,908 --> 01:08:37,329
I didn't ask for any
responsibility.

868
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:42,250
Just a little privacy.

869
01:08:43,585 --> 01:08:45,628
Well, you're in luck.
Let me show you.

870
01:08:45,712 --> 01:08:49,215
Because privacy is what
drive-in movies are all about.

871
01:08:49,299 --> 01:08:51,384
So, scrunch down like this.

872
01:08:52,594 --> 01:08:55,430
Come on. Scrunch down.

873
01:08:55,513 --> 01:08:57,557
All the way.

874
01:09:00,185 --> 01:09:02,395
And then give me your arm.

875
01:09:03,521 --> 01:09:05,690
Put your arm around me.

876
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:12,530
You just cuddle and
hug and, you know.

877
01:09:12,614 --> 01:09:15,158
You don't really
watch the movie.

878
01:09:15,241 --> 01:09:18,286
I would watch the movie.

879
01:09:50,485 --> 01:09:53,905
Sorry, Fuzzy. It's
Homer's splice again.

880
01:10:03,289 --> 01:10:05,417
Fuzzy?

881
01:10:15,635 --> 01:10:17,762
Fuzz?

882
01:10:21,099 --> 01:10:23,643
If the little ones want
to know what happened,

883
01:10:23,727 --> 01:10:28,023
tell them that
Fuzzy was adopted.

884
01:10:29,899 --> 01:10:34,446
- Okay.
- So, what happened to Fuzzy?

885
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:37,991
- He was adopted.
- Good.

886
01:10:46,416 --> 01:10:49,252
- Will they believe that, you think?
- They'll believe it...

887
01:10:49,336 --> 01:10:51,671
because they want to believe it.

888
01:10:55,008 --> 01:10:59,095
- Shouldn't we tell Homer?
- If Homer wanted to know what was happening here,

889
01:10:59,179 --> 01:11:02,974
he could pick up the
telephone and call us.

890
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:08,188
I think it was a nurse or a nanny
who, uh, who adopted Fuzzy.

891
01:11:08,271 --> 01:11:10,982
Someone who could
take care of him.

892
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:14,736
Because they had a better
breathing machine...

893
01:11:14,819 --> 01:11:17,030
than the one that Dr
Larch built for him.

894
01:11:17,113 --> 01:11:21,076
So I think we should be
happy for Fuzzy, okay?

895
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:27,999
He found a family.
Good night, Fuzzy.

896
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:31,378
Good night, Fuzzy.

897
01:11:39,678 --> 01:11:42,138
Homer. Morning, everybody.

898
01:11:42,222 --> 01:11:44,224
Mornin', Miss Olive.

899
01:11:44,307 --> 01:11:46,559
- Look. There's mail for you, Homer.
- Oh, thank you.

900
01:11:46,643 --> 01:11:51,523
Rose, I brought those clothes for you.
Come on. Let's go see if they fit.

901
01:11:53,149 --> 01:11:56,236
What's that?

902
01:11:58,863 --> 01:12:02,867
- Oh, ain't you gonna open it, Homer?
- No.

903
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:05,453
Mind your business,
now, Peaches.

904
01:12:05,537 --> 01:12:07,622
- Sorry 'bout that, Homer.
- It's okay.

905
01:12:39,738 --> 01:12:43,616
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Oh, look. Right here.

906
01:12:49,873 --> 01:12:52,667
It's glass. Look at that.

907
01:12:52,751 --> 01:12:55,337
- Isn't that beautiful?
- Mm-hmm.

908
01:12:58,131 --> 01:13:01,301
Give me your hand. Feel that.

909
01:13:04,054 --> 01:13:06,181
- Feel that?
- Mm-hmm.

910
01:13:08,725 --> 01:13:10,810
The ocean rubs it
against the sand.

911
01:13:10,894 --> 01:13:12,979
That's how it gets that smooth.

912
01:13:15,482 --> 01:13:18,026
Takes a year for it to
get like that, though.

913
01:13:27,869 --> 01:13:30,038
Come on.

914
01:13:35,126 --> 01:13:37,796
Ah! You're too fast!

915
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:07,844
He volunteered.

916
01:15:07,969 --> 01:15:12,891
Jesus. Nobody volunteers for the Burma run.
He said so himself.

917
01:15:13,016 --> 01:15:17,854
He just leaves me here. What does he want?
He wants me to wait for him?

918
01:15:17,979 --> 01:15:19,939
Oh, God, he knows me.

919
01:15:21,608 --> 01:15:23,818
He knows I'm not
good at being alone.

920
01:15:28,406 --> 01:15:32,535
This was right. I
know this was right.

921
01:15:32,619 --> 01:15:34,788
- You're right. This was right.
- Yeah.

922
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:41,294
Just tell me. Do you want me to stay?
Do you want me to go?

923
01:15:42,587 --> 01:15:45,674
I don't know. I
really don't know.

924
01:15:45,799 --> 01:15:48,551
I just...

925
01:15:48,635 --> 01:15:50,845
think we should
just wait and see.

926
01:15:52,931 --> 01:15:54,975
Okay.

927
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:02,107
- Are we all set?
- Yeah, that's it.

928
01:16:05,318 --> 01:16:07,904
Goodbye, Arthur. Thank you
again for all your hard work.

929
01:16:08,029 --> 01:16:10,949
- My pleasure, ma'am.
- Have a safe trip, Rose. God bless.

930
01:16:11,074 --> 01:16:13,034
- Take care now.
- Homer, you take care of yourself.

931
01:16:13,159 --> 01:16:15,120
- Okay. You too. Okay.
- We'll see you next year.

932
01:16:15,245 --> 01:16:17,205
- Homer, see you later.
- Bye, everyone. - Bye.

933
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:21,209
- Don't freeze to death, Homer.
- Don't get yourself in no trouble, Homer.

934
01:16:21,334 --> 01:16:25,005
- Go on and freeze to death if you want to, Homer.
- Shut up, Jack.

935
01:16:29,301 --> 01:16:31,928
Take care of yourself, Homer.

936
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:53,241
So you're staying.

937
01:16:55,702 --> 01:16:57,829
Olive told me.

938
01:16:59,956 --> 01:17:02,083
You know, you could
have told me yourself.

939
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:08,715
I'm just waiting and
seeing, like you said.

940
01:17:37,243 --> 01:17:40,747
Dear Dr Larch, Thank you
for your doctor's bag,

941
01:17:40,872 --> 01:17:44,292
although it seems that I will not
have the occasion to use it,

942
01:17:44,376 --> 01:17:46,711
barring some
emergency, of course.

943
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:49,839
I'm not a doctor.

944
01:17:49,923 --> 01:17:54,219
With all due respect to your
profession, I'm enjoying my life here.

945
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:57,430
I'm enjoying being a
lobsterman and an orchardman.

946
01:17:57,514 --> 01:18:01,351
In fact, I've never
enjoyed myself as much.

947
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:05,647
The truth is, I want to stay here.
I believe I'm being of some use.

948
01:18:19,953 --> 01:18:22,038
I've looked at so many women,

949
01:18:23,581 --> 01:18:25,834
and I've never...

950
01:18:27,085 --> 01:18:29,087
I've never felt a
thing, you know.

951
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:31,172
I mean, I've seen everything.

952
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:34,509
Just felt nothing.

953
01:18:36,094 --> 01:18:38,513
With you, it, uh...

954
01:18:43,184 --> 01:18:45,395
To look at you, it hurts.

955
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:51,484
Come here.

956
01:19:02,454 --> 01:19:04,456
My dear Homer:

957
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:06,750
I thought you were over
your adolescence...

958
01:19:06,833 --> 01:19:09,461
the first time in our lives
when we imagine we have...

959
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:12,714
something terrible to hide
from those who love us.

960
01:19:16,092 --> 01:19:20,347
- Homer?
- Do you think it's not obvious to us what's happened to you?

961
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:22,724
You've fallen in
love, haven't you?

962
01:19:24,684 --> 01:19:28,813
By the way, whatever you're up to
can't be too good for your heart.

963
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:33,068
Then again, it's the sort of condition that
could be made worse by worrying about it,

964
01:19:33,151 --> 01:19:35,236
so don't worry about it.

965
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:41,201
Dear Dr Larch:

966
01:19:41,284 --> 01:19:44,954
What I'm learning here may not be as
important as what I learned from you,

967
01:19:45,038 --> 01:19:47,707
but everything is new to me.

968
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:50,585
Yesterday, I learned
how to poison mice.

969
01:19:50,669 --> 01:19:54,631
Field mice girdle an apple tree,
pine mice kill the roots.

970
01:19:54,714 --> 01:19:57,050
You use poison oats
and poison corn.

971
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:03,139
I know what you have to do.
You have to play God.

972
01:20:03,223 --> 01:20:06,935
Well, killing mice is as close as
I want to come to playing God.

973
01:20:08,478 --> 01:20:10,480
Homer, here in St. Cloud's,

974
01:20:10,563 --> 01:20:13,233
I have been given the
opportunity of playing God...

975
01:20:13,316 --> 01:20:16,820
or leaving practically
everything up to chance.

976
01:20:16,903 --> 01:20:19,489
Men and women of conscience
should seize those moments...

977
01:20:19,572 --> 01:20:21,992
when it's possible to play God.

978
01:20:22,075 --> 01:20:24,160
There won't be many.

979
01:20:24,244 --> 01:20:26,371
Do I interfere when
absolutely helpless women...

980
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:29,332
tell me they simply can't
have an abortion...

981
01:20:29,416 --> 01:20:33,420
that they simply must go through with
having another and yet another orphan?

982
01:20:33,503 --> 01:20:37,716
I do not. I do not
even recommend.

983
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:40,135
I just give them what they want.

984
01:20:47,559 --> 01:20:50,103
You are my work of art, Homer.

985
01:20:50,186 --> 01:20:53,231
Everything else has
been just a job.

986
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:56,401
I don't know if you've got
a work of art in you,

987
01:20:56,484 --> 01:21:00,071
but I know what your job
is: You're a doctor.

988
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:02,574
I'm not a doctor.

989
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:05,118
You're going to replace me.

990
01:21:05,201 --> 01:21:07,454
The board of trustees is
looking for my replacement.

991
01:21:07,537 --> 01:21:09,706
I can't replace you. I'm sorry.

992
01:21:09,789 --> 01:21:13,001
"Sorry"? I'm not sorry.

993
01:21:13,084 --> 01:21:16,004
Not for anything I've done.

994
01:21:16,087 --> 01:21:18,506
I'm not even sorry
that I love you.

995
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:34,856
I think we may have
lost him to the world.

996
01:21:38,401 --> 01:21:41,071
Come on, come on.
Just read the label.

997
01:21:41,154 --> 01:21:43,239
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

998
01:21:43,323 --> 01:21:46,451
Okay. You can have the book.

999
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:49,204
You can have the book, but
please don't tickle me.

1000
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:00,298
Oh.

1001
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:03,927
Who is it?

1002
01:22:04,010 --> 01:22:06,554
Don't know.

1003
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:14,562
It's Mr Rose.

1004
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:18,400
Hey!

1005
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,990
- Hey, Homer.
- Hero. How ya doin'?

1006
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:26,950
Good. Miss Candy.

1007
01:22:27,033 --> 01:22:29,411
- Hey, Homer.
- Good to see you again.

1008
01:22:29,494 --> 01:22:31,663
- Thank you.
- Welcome back.

1009
01:22:31,746 --> 01:22:33,748
- Hey, Muddy.
- Hi, Miss Candy.

1010
01:22:33,832 --> 01:22:36,418
- We put in new sheets for you.
- I see you ain't freezed your ass off.

1011
01:22:36,501 --> 01:22:38,586
- It's fine. I'm sure.
- I was just finishing.

1012
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:42,465
- Hey, Mr Rose.
- Peaches, how are you?

1013
01:22:42,549 --> 01:22:44,676
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

1014
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:46,928
- Leave it. It's good.
- You sure? - Candy.

1015
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:51,141
Mr Rose. Welcome back.

1016
01:22:51,224 --> 01:22:53,351
Thank you.

1017
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:56,688
Don't this place
feel just like home?

1018
01:22:56,771 --> 01:23:00,150
- Nicer than home.
- What you all been doin' make it feel so nice?

1019
01:23:00,233 --> 01:23:02,527
- Hey, Rose.
- Rose, Rose.

1020
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:06,323
Good to see you again.
How are you?

1021
01:23:06,406 --> 01:23:08,742
Where's Jack?

1022
01:23:08,825 --> 01:23:12,329
He, uh, he just wasn't up
for the trip this season.

1023
01:23:16,708 --> 01:23:19,294
Jack didn't know what
his business was.

1024
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:24,799
- Ain't that right, Muddy?
- Mm-hmm.

1025
01:23:33,224 --> 01:23:36,186
Muddy, Muddy, half
these is bruised.

1026
01:23:36,269 --> 01:23:38,980
This one ain't got no stem.
What is this, now?

1027
01:23:39,064 --> 01:23:41,900
That's a spur, ain't it?

1028
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:44,611
You're in too much of a hurry.
What is wrong with you?

1029
01:23:44,694 --> 01:23:46,738
You shakin' the tree to
get these apples down?

1030
01:23:48,907 --> 01:23:51,868
You're bruisin' all
of these apples.

1031
01:24:31,992 --> 01:24:34,160
Ain't you gonna eat
with us, Rose?

1032
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:41,209
- She used to eat with us.
- Maybe she ain't hungry this mornin'.

1033
01:24:43,670 --> 01:24:45,797
She ain't hungry every mornin',

1034
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,049
'cause she's sick every mornin'.

1035
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:03,732
Hey, Rose. How you feelin'?

1036
01:25:07,485 --> 01:25:10,780
Guess you must like
watchin' people be sick.

1037
01:25:10,864 --> 01:25:13,283
No, I don't like
watchin' anyone be sick.

1038
01:25:24,002 --> 01:25:27,213
Rose, how many months are you?

1039
01:25:29,674 --> 01:25:31,801
Do you know?

1040
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:37,265
Do you know? Rose?

1041
01:25:40,727 --> 01:25:43,188
What do you know about it?

1042
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:46,316
Well, I know more than I'd
like to know about it.

1043
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:50,278
Well, then, don't trouble
yourself none, Homer.

1044
01:25:50,362 --> 01:25:52,489
This ain't your business.

1045
01:25:57,243 --> 01:25:59,329
Right.

1046
01:26:08,922 --> 01:26:11,883
What am I gonna do with a baby?

1047
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:14,052
I can't have a baby.

1048
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:16,137
What am I gonna do with a baby?

1049
01:26:16,221 --> 01:26:20,976
- Huh?
- Whatever you want to do, Rose, I can help.

1050
01:26:25,563 --> 01:26:29,985
I just mean that if you don't wanna
keep the baby, I know where you can go.

1051
01:26:31,569 --> 01:26:35,031
You think Daddy's gonna
let me go anywhere? Huh?

1052
01:26:36,533 --> 01:26:38,785
I ain't goin' nowhere.

1053
01:26:41,538 --> 01:26:45,667
Why don't you just, uh, go
back to your pickin', Homer.

1054
01:26:47,127 --> 01:26:49,629
I can take care of it
by myself, all right?

1055
01:26:51,172 --> 01:26:53,466
What do you mean?

1056
01:26:53,550 --> 01:26:57,679
I mean I could take care
of it by myself. Okay?

1057
01:26:57,762 --> 01:27:00,015
Don't do anything, Rose.

1058
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:05,520
Don't do anything
to yourself, okay?

1059
01:27:06,813 --> 01:27:09,816
Rose? Do you hear me?

1060
01:27:09,899 --> 01:27:13,028
- Rose, do you hear me?
- Go on! - Homer?

1061
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:26,583
I think we should take her to St. Cloud's
and let her decide when she gets there.

1062
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:29,044
I told her. She doesn't
feel she can do that.

1063
01:27:29,169 --> 01:27:31,546
Well, we have to
help her, right?

1064
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,927
We need to do
something, don't we?

1065
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:44,184
Homer?

1066
01:27:56,613 --> 01:27:58,740
- Hey.
- Hey.

1067
01:28:01,534 --> 01:28:05,830
I have some more clothes for you. I just
keep forgetting to bring them with me.

1068
01:28:05,914 --> 01:28:09,084
I don't need no more clothes.
Thanks.

1069
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:19,844
I know what's goin' on, Rose.

1070
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:22,097
Homer told me.

1071
01:28:23,932 --> 01:28:28,311
You don't know this, but I got
pregnant about a year ago.

1072
01:28:36,444 --> 01:28:38,822
Do you want to have this baby?

1073
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:44,244
No?

1074
01:28:45,495 --> 01:28:48,081
Who's the father? Does he know?

1075
01:28:51,584 --> 01:28:55,630
If you don't want to have this baby, Homer
and I will take you to a place. It's safe.

1076
01:28:55,755 --> 01:28:58,216
- He knows this doc...
- I can't go nowhere.

1077
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:01,344
Why?

1078
01:29:03,763 --> 01:29:07,100
Rose, listen to me.

1079
01:29:07,183 --> 01:29:09,144
You can tell me.

1080
01:29:12,981 --> 01:29:17,193
It's okay.

1081
01:29:20,989 --> 01:29:24,659
- Mornin'.
- Morning, Mr Rose.

1082
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:30,248
I'm gonna be up top, okay?

1083
01:29:52,729 --> 01:29:56,066
Mr Rose.

1084
01:29:57,942 --> 01:30:00,403
He's the father.

1085
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:03,156
- What?
- He's her baby's father.

1086
01:30:03,239 --> 01:30:05,950
Mr Rose is her baby's father.

1087
01:30:06,034 --> 01:30:09,412
Her baby. Mr Rose is the father.

1088
01:30:09,496 --> 01:30:13,541
- What? Are you sure?
- I can't believe this.

1089
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:17,087
I knew there was something wrong.
What is she gonna do?

1090
01:30:19,214 --> 01:30:23,301
God, I can't believe it. We have to
keep her away from that bastard.

1091
01:30:34,646 --> 01:30:37,315
- Mr Rose?
- Homer.

1092
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:41,152
I know you ain't ready
for lunch, boy.

1093
01:30:42,696 --> 01:30:45,907
- Is it, uh, true?
- What's that?

1094
01:30:45,991 --> 01:30:48,618
Uh, are you...

1095
01:30:49,828 --> 01:30:51,830
sleeping with your own daughter?

1096
01:31:14,436 --> 01:31:17,480
I think you've been staying
up too late at night, Homer.

1097
01:31:26,823 --> 01:31:28,825
You're having sex with
your own daughter.

1098
01:31:28,908 --> 01:31:32,704
Ain't nobody havin' sex with my daughter!
Let me just tell you that.

1099
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:36,708
You're lying. Aren't you
ashamed of yourself?

1100
01:31:40,128 --> 01:31:42,130
What do you care who hears?

1101
01:31:42,213 --> 01:31:44,966
I mean, come on. They
know already, don't they?

1102
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:48,970
- They know, Mr Rose.
- And you know what your business is, boy!

1103
01:31:49,054 --> 01:31:52,474
I know you don't wanna be in
no kind of business with me!

1104
01:31:52,557 --> 01:31:56,353
- That's what I know.
- Yeah? Go on. Cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.

1105
01:31:56,436 --> 01:31:59,689
You gonna come here talkin'
to me about lies and shame?

1106
01:31:59,773 --> 01:32:02,692
Those people took you in, and
that boy Wally is away at war!

1107
01:32:02,776 --> 01:32:05,862
- Yeah, well, she's your daughter!
- And I love her!

1108
01:32:08,031 --> 01:32:10,325
Ain't never gonna do
nothin' to harm her.

1109
01:32:16,915 --> 01:32:18,917
She's pregnant, you know that?
She's pregnant.

1110
01:33:16,516 --> 01:33:19,394
No! No!

1111
01:33:24,774 --> 01:33:27,193
He was over Burma when
he was shot down.

1112
01:33:27,277 --> 01:33:31,031
There were no injuries from
the crash, just disease.

1113
01:33:31,114 --> 01:33:35,952
When the plane was hit, the crew chief
and the radioman jumped close together.

1114
01:33:36,036 --> 01:33:40,165
The co-pilot jumped third, all
on Captain Worthington's orders.

1115
01:33:40,248 --> 01:33:43,835
- Come in.
- The captain was still flying the plane.

1116
01:33:43,918 --> 01:33:47,547
None of the men on the ground could see
the sky. That's how thick the jungle was.

1117
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:51,801
They never saw the plane crash.
They never heard it crash.

1118
01:33:51,885 --> 01:33:55,180
They never saw Captain
Worthington's parachute either.

1119
01:33:55,263 --> 01:33:57,474
But he was missing for 20 days.
Why?

1120
01:33:57,557 --> 01:34:02,187
He followed the Irrawaddy
River all the way to Rangoon.

1121
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:06,149
He managed to avoid the Japs
but not the mosquitoes.

1122
01:34:07,317 --> 01:34:09,319
So it's malaria.

1123
01:34:09,402 --> 01:34:11,613
It's, um, encephalitis "B."

1124
01:34:11,696 --> 01:34:13,865
What's that?

1125
01:34:13,948 --> 01:34:18,244
Captain Worthington is
paralysed from the waist down.

1126
01:34:18,328 --> 01:34:20,455
He... He won't walk.

1127
01:34:29,756 --> 01:34:33,259
- I'm sorry.
- When is he coming home?

1128
01:34:33,343 --> 01:34:37,055
In about a month. By
the end of October.

1129
01:34:53,029 --> 01:34:55,532
Just tell me. I'll do
whatever you wanna do.

1130
01:34:56,616 --> 01:34:58,660
Nothing.

1131
01:35:00,954 --> 01:35:03,081
Isn't that like
waiting and seeing?

1132
01:35:06,084 --> 01:35:10,338
No. Nothing's nothing.

1133
01:35:15,176 --> 01:35:17,220
I want Wally to come home.

1134
01:35:20,682 --> 01:35:23,226
I'm afraid to see him too.

1135
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:27,188
- I know.
- Oh, don't do that, Homer.

1136
01:35:33,695 --> 01:35:36,573
I just want to sit
here and do nothing.

1137
01:35:40,327 --> 01:35:42,620
To do nothing.

1138
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:47,292
It's a great idea, really.

1139
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:50,920
Maybe if I just wait
and see long enough,

1140
01:35:51,004 --> 01:35:54,716
then I won't have to do anything
or decide anything, you know?

1141
01:35:54,799 --> 01:35:57,844
I mean, maybe if
I'm lucky enough,

1142
01:35:57,927 --> 01:36:01,890
someone else will decide and
choose and do things for me.

1143
01:36:03,016 --> 01:36:05,101
What are you talking about?

1144
01:36:07,604 --> 01:36:11,733
But then again, maybe I
won't be that lucky.

1145
01:36:14,527 --> 01:36:18,490
And it's not my fault.
It's not your fault.

1146
01:36:20,575 --> 01:36:25,288
And that's just it. Someone's gonna
get hurt, and it's no one's fault.

1147
01:36:25,372 --> 01:36:29,000
- I don't want to talk about this.
- If we just sit here...

1148
01:36:29,084 --> 01:36:32,253
and we wait and see a
little while longer,

1149
01:36:32,337 --> 01:36:36,299
then maybe you won't have to choose,
and I won't have todo anything!

1150
01:36:36,383 --> 01:36:40,428
What do you want from me? Wally's
been shot down. He's paralysed.

1151
01:36:40,512 --> 01:36:42,472
What do you want me to do?

1152
01:36:42,555 --> 01:36:45,850
Nothing. I'm sorry.

1153
01:36:49,938 --> 01:36:53,108
You're not the one who
has to do anything.

1154
01:37:04,619 --> 01:37:07,330
Where you think you're goin'?

1155
01:37:07,414 --> 01:37:09,624
I got to go, Daddy. You
have to let me go.

1156
01:37:09,708 --> 01:37:13,461
Wait, Rose. Just wait. I ain't gonna let
you go nowhere in the middle of the night.

1157
01:37:13,545 --> 01:37:15,547
- Hey. Hey.
- I can't stay here no more, Daddy.

1158
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:19,259
Hey, nothin'. You just go in the house.
This ain't none of your concern.

1159
01:37:19,342 --> 01:37:21,428
- Just listen to me...
- You are forgettin' yourself now.

1160
01:37:21,511 --> 01:37:24,681
This is my daughter!

1161
01:37:24,764 --> 01:37:27,809
Now, I believe you got your
own mess you gotta deal with.

1162
01:37:27,892 --> 01:37:29,894
- I wanna get...
- Ain't that right, Homer?

1163
01:37:31,187 --> 01:37:33,523
Ain't that right, Homer?

1164
01:37:33,606 --> 01:37:36,318
My daughter and I done told you.
This ain't your business.

1165
01:37:36,401 --> 01:37:39,487
This ain't none
of your business!

1166
01:37:39,571 --> 01:37:43,074
Ya even know what your
business is, Homer? Do ya!

1167
01:37:43,158 --> 01:37:46,286
- What is your business?
- I'm in the doctor business.

1168
01:37:46,369 --> 01:37:49,706
I can help. That's all I'm saying.
I can help.

1169
01:38:16,399 --> 01:38:18,401
Forceps.

1170
01:38:18,485 --> 01:38:22,656
Cervical stabilizer,
vulval pads.

1171
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:26,743
Set of sims. Set
of reinstadards.

1172
01:38:26,826 --> 01:38:31,206
- Dakin's solution.
- She my little girl, Homer.

1173
01:38:31,289 --> 01:38:35,293
She's gonna be all right, Mr Rose.
Nothin' to worry about.

1174
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:45,053
You ready, Rose?

1175
01:38:48,723 --> 01:38:50,767
Fellas...

1176
01:38:52,519 --> 01:38:54,604
Come on, y'all.

1177
01:39:05,073 --> 01:39:07,325
I'm staying, Homer.

1178
01:39:08,702 --> 01:39:10,745
Okay.

1179
01:39:10,829 --> 01:39:14,749
If you stay, you
make yourself a use.

1180
01:39:53,621 --> 01:39:56,124
Watch her breathing.

1181
01:40:08,678 --> 01:40:10,680
You better go get some air.

1182
01:40:18,146 --> 01:40:20,357
Oh!

1183
01:40:30,825 --> 01:40:35,747
Oh, God!

1184
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:50,929
Hey.

1185
01:40:53,264 --> 01:40:55,850
The heat will help the
cramps ease up a little.

1186
01:40:58,311 --> 01:41:01,064
The bleeding is usually a
lot less within two days,

1187
01:41:01,189 --> 01:41:04,025
but you just keep
checking the pad, okay?

1188
01:41:06,277 --> 01:41:09,948
As long as it's not
heavy, it's normal.

1189
01:41:45,692 --> 01:41:51,364
It's that Vernon. He keep askin' where
you, Rose Rose and Homer is at.

1190
01:41:51,448 --> 01:41:54,451
Tell that Vernon to mind
his own business, Muddy.

1191
01:41:56,870 --> 01:41:59,622
Told him y'all sick.

1192
01:41:59,706 --> 01:42:02,459
You tell him whatever you want.

1193
01:42:02,542 --> 01:42:05,003
You crew boss today.

1194
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:22,520
- You readin' the rules, Homer?
- Mm-hmm.

1195
01:42:23,897 --> 01:42:25,857
What are they?

1196
01:42:27,942 --> 01:42:30,028
Uh...

1197
01:42:31,738 --> 01:42:33,782
"Please don't smoke in bed."

1198
01:42:33,865 --> 01:42:36,785
We already heard
that one, Homer.

1199
01:42:36,868 --> 01:42:42,415
"Two: Please don't operate the grinder
or press if you've been drinking."

1200
01:42:42,499 --> 01:42:46,628
"Three: Please don't go up to
the roof to eat your lunch."

1201
01:42:46,711 --> 01:42:48,713
That's the best
place to eat lunch.

1202
01:42:48,797 --> 01:42:52,550
"Four: Please, even
if you are very hot,

1203
01:42:52,676 --> 01:42:54,678
do not go up to the
roof to sleep."

1204
01:42:54,761 --> 01:42:58,098
What do they think, go
up to the roof to sleep?

1205
01:42:58,181 --> 01:43:00,642
- They must think we're crazy.
- They think we dumb niggers,

1206
01:43:00,767 --> 01:43:03,103
so we need some dumb
rules, is what they think.

1207
01:43:03,186 --> 01:43:05,563
The last one.

1208
01:43:05,647 --> 01:43:09,067
"There should be no going
up on the roof at night."

1209
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:13,822
Now, why don't they just say,
"Don't go up on the roof"?

1210
01:43:13,905 --> 01:43:17,283
- That's it?
- That's it.

1211
01:43:17,367 --> 01:43:21,955
- Hmm.
- It don't mean nothin' at all.

1212
01:43:22,038 --> 01:43:26,418
- And all this time I been wonderin' about 'em.
- They outrageous, them rules.

1213
01:43:28,837 --> 01:43:30,964
Who live in this cider house?

1214
01:43:37,053 --> 01:43:41,891
Who grindin' up those apples,
pressin' that cider,

1215
01:43:41,975 --> 01:43:44,102
cleanin' up all this mess?

1216
01:43:46,646 --> 01:43:51,276
Who just plain live here, just
breathin' in that vinegar?

1217
01:43:55,447 --> 01:43:59,743
Well, someone who don't
live here made those rules.

1218
01:44:02,746 --> 01:44:06,082
These rules ain't for us.

1219
01:44:06,166 --> 01:44:09,461
We the ones supposed
to make our own rules.

1220
01:44:11,046 --> 01:44:13,465
And we do.

1221
01:44:13,548 --> 01:44:15,800
Every single day.

1222
01:44:19,596 --> 01:44:21,640
Ain't that right, Homer?

1223
01:44:22,724 --> 01:44:24,643
That's right.

1224
01:44:27,395 --> 01:44:30,482
Then why don't you burn
them rules in the stove?

1225
01:44:32,275 --> 01:44:34,819
Go 'head, Homer. Do it.

1226
01:45:14,859 --> 01:45:16,987
Nothing is nothing, right?

1227
01:45:19,322 --> 01:45:21,366
You know I love you.

1228
01:45:22,867 --> 01:45:25,328
You know I do.

1229
01:45:25,412 --> 01:45:27,539
You needed me.

1230
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:31,668
Now Wally's gonna need you.

1231
01:45:31,751 --> 01:45:33,378
Homer.

1232
01:45:37,841 --> 01:45:40,093
I'm sorry.

1233
01:45:42,304 --> 01:45:45,390
At least there's no more
waiting and seeing.

1234
01:45:48,059 --> 01:45:51,438
At least I got to see the ocean.

1235
01:46:06,453 --> 01:46:10,457
Homer! Rose Rose done run away.

1236
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:14,419
- She took off in the middle of the night.
- She left on the bicycle.

1237
01:46:14,502 --> 01:46:16,546
What?

1238
01:46:20,967 --> 01:46:23,053
Nobody gonna find her.

1239
01:46:23,136 --> 01:46:25,597
She long gone.

1240
01:46:27,891 --> 01:46:30,644
I didn't try stop her.

1241
01:46:30,727 --> 01:46:33,438
I just want to touch her
hand before she go.

1242
01:46:34,564 --> 01:46:36,608
That's all I wanna do.

1243
01:46:37,776 --> 01:46:40,153
That's all.

1244
01:46:40,236 --> 01:46:42,322
I swear.

1245
01:46:43,573 --> 01:46:46,242
Where she get that knife, Muddy?

1246
01:46:46,326 --> 01:46:49,371
Look like your knife.

1247
01:46:49,454 --> 01:46:51,539
No gal need to be out here
tryin' to hitch-hike...

1248
01:46:51,623 --> 01:46:55,293
unless she got a good,
strong knife to hold onto.

1249
01:46:56,836 --> 01:46:58,922
Where'd she get you?

1250
01:46:59,005 --> 01:47:04,219
Just misunderstood me.

1251
01:47:04,302 --> 01:47:08,139
I was tryin' to give her my knife, and
I reach out my hand to touch her.

1252
01:47:08,223 --> 01:47:11,935
But see, I understand, Homer,

1253
01:47:12,018 --> 01:47:14,270
if she don't see it like that.

1254
01:47:14,354 --> 01:47:16,898
It's my fault.

1255
01:47:16,982 --> 01:47:19,442
She good with that knife.

1256
01:47:19,526 --> 01:47:22,779
She's fast.

1257
01:47:22,862 --> 01:47:25,532
She a lot better with that
knife than you is, Muddy.

1258
01:47:25,615 --> 01:47:28,034
Who do you suppose taught her?

1259
01:47:29,536 --> 01:47:32,455
- You taught her, I suppose.
- That's right.

1260
01:47:32,539 --> 01:47:35,667
That's right.

1261
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:37,794
There's more than one cut.

1262
01:47:37,877 --> 01:47:41,715
That's 'cause I take my knife
and stick it in the wound.

1263
01:47:41,798 --> 01:47:44,718
I stick my own knife in there.

1264
01:47:44,801 --> 01:47:47,012
I poked it all around, Homer,

1265
01:47:48,513 --> 01:47:51,349
tryin' to find the same
spot that she got.

1266
01:47:52,684 --> 01:47:55,812
Now, look here.

1267
01:47:55,895 --> 01:47:59,316
When you tell the police
how this happened,

1268
01:47:59,399 --> 01:48:02,736
I want you to tell
it like this, hear?

1269
01:48:02,819 --> 01:48:08,366
My daughter run off. I was so sad
about that, I stabbed myself.

1270
01:48:08,450 --> 01:48:11,536
I was so unhappy that
she left that...

1271
01:48:13,788 --> 01:48:15,790
I killed my own self.

1272
01:48:15,874 --> 01:48:18,710
And that's the truth.

1273
01:48:18,793 --> 01:48:20,879
Ain't that right?

1274
01:48:23,715 --> 01:48:25,717
I wanna hear you say that.

1275
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:28,595
I was so unhappy that
my daughter run off...

1276
01:48:30,805 --> 01:48:33,099
That...

1277
01:48:33,183 --> 01:48:35,226
I killed my own self.

1278
01:48:36,645 --> 01:48:39,939
- Ain't that right, Homer?
- That's right.

1279
01:48:40,023 --> 01:48:44,235
- Huh, Muddy?
- Yeah, that's what happened.

1280
01:48:44,319 --> 01:48:48,365
You lost your only daughter, so's you
killed yourself. That's what we say.

1281
01:48:48,448 --> 01:48:53,119
That's right. That's the truth.

1282
01:48:53,203 --> 01:48:55,538
I'm just tryin' to
put things straight.

1283
01:48:55,622 --> 01:48:59,250
Sometimes you gotta
break some rules,

1284
01:48:59,334 --> 01:49:01,544
put things straight.

1285
01:49:03,713 --> 01:49:05,924
Ain't that right, Homer?

1286
01:49:14,099 --> 01:49:16,226
Good.

1287
01:50:15,577 --> 01:50:17,829
Do you think Rose will be okay?

1288
01:50:17,912 --> 01:50:21,124
She'll be all right. She knows
how to take care of herself.

1289
01:50:27,339 --> 01:50:30,258
This is for you. Olive
wanted me to bring it.

1290
01:50:30,342 --> 01:50:32,510
Oh, thanks.

1291
01:50:39,225 --> 01:50:43,063
I know you don't think much of being
needed, or of me for that matter, but l...

1292
01:50:43,146 --> 01:50:47,025
I'm sorry for what I said
about Wally needing you.

1293
01:50:47,108 --> 01:50:49,319
It was unnecessary.

1294
01:50:52,072 --> 01:50:54,199
You had every right to be angry.

1295
01:50:56,242 --> 01:50:58,328
No, you warned me.

1296
01:50:58,411 --> 01:51:04,000
You told me you weren't
any good at being alone.

1297
01:51:15,553 --> 01:51:18,473
Wally's gonna be okay.

1298
01:51:18,556 --> 01:51:20,558
I know he is.

1299
01:51:21,685 --> 01:51:23,728
Yeah?

1300
01:52:09,190 --> 01:52:14,112
Dear Homer: I am writing you
to tell you about Dr Larch.

1301
01:53:15,757 --> 01:53:17,842
Dr Larch?

1302
01:53:20,011 --> 01:53:22,180
Dr Larch?

1303
01:53:30,313 --> 01:53:32,440
Wilbur.

1304
01:53:32,565 --> 01:53:34,693
Oh, Wilbur.

1305
01:53:35,986 --> 01:53:38,113
Wilbur.

1306
01:53:39,864 --> 01:53:42,784
And saw the splendour
of the moonlight

1307
01:53:42,867 --> 01:53:47,747
On Honolulu Bay

1308
01:53:47,831 --> 01:53:52,460
There's something tender in
the moonlight on Honolulu Bay

1309
01:53:52,585 --> 01:53:54,879
I can assure you
that the overdose...

1310
01:53:54,963 --> 01:53:57,090
was entirely accidental.

1311
01:54:08,727 --> 01:54:12,063
Let us be happy for Dr Larch.

1312
01:54:12,147 --> 01:54:17,360
Dr Larch has found a family.
Good night, Dr Larch.

1313
01:54:17,444 --> 01:54:19,904
Good night, Dr Larch.

1314
01:54:37,756 --> 01:54:40,300
- Come on, Muddy.
- Step on it, man!

1315
01:54:40,425 --> 01:54:44,471
- Let's get on it.
- Get on it, man. I wanna get to the sunshine.

1316
01:54:44,554 --> 01:54:46,848
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Homer!

1317
01:54:46,973 --> 01:54:49,267
- Yeah!
- You ever seen a palm tree?

1318
01:54:49,351 --> 01:54:51,394
Oh, he ain't never
been outta Maine!

1319
01:54:51,478 --> 01:54:54,105
Ain't you sick of
pine trees, Homer?

1320
01:54:54,189 --> 01:54:57,233
- Let me tell you something about Florida, Homer.
- - The sun shines!

1321
01:54:57,317 --> 01:55:00,528
Man, it's so warm down there,
you can pick grapefruits...

1322
01:55:00,612 --> 01:55:03,073
and oranges naked
if you want to.

1323
01:55:03,198 --> 01:55:05,950
- Who would want to do that?
- - I'm just sayin' it's warm, Hero.

1324
01:55:06,034 --> 01:55:09,621
You used to say it was too hot.

1325
01:55:09,746 --> 01:55:11,623
Not me.

1326
01:55:12,791 --> 01:55:15,752
I love them peaches.

1327
01:55:15,835 --> 01:55:19,756
I love my peaches.

1328
01:55:19,839 --> 01:55:23,760
Homer? Hey, what
you think, Homer?

1329
01:55:23,885 --> 01:55:26,346
I'd love to go with you guys,

1330
01:55:26,471 --> 01:55:28,848
but I have to move on.

1331
01:55:33,228 --> 01:55:35,522
- Hey, you hear that, Muddy?
- What?

1332
01:55:35,605 --> 01:55:38,525
- Boy said he ain't movin' on with us.
- Oh, Homer!

1333
01:55:38,608 --> 01:55:42,320
Come on, Homer. Come
on down with us!

1334
01:55:42,404 --> 01:55:47,575
- I can't do it, guys.
- Well, I reckon you gotta do what you gotta do.

1335
01:55:53,832 --> 01:55:57,544
O Lord, support us
all the day long...

1336
01:55:57,627 --> 01:56:02,340
until the shadows lengthen
and the evening comes...

1337
01:56:02,424 --> 01:56:07,929
and the busy world is hushed and the fever
of life is over and our work is done.

1338
01:56:08,013 --> 01:56:12,475
Then, in Thy mercy, grant us a
safe lodging and a holy rest...

1339
01:56:12,559 --> 01:56:15,603
and peace at the last.

1340
01:56:15,687 --> 01:56:17,772
Amen.

1341
01:57:18,667 --> 01:57:21,252
Homer?

1342
01:57:24,005 --> 01:57:27,008
Homer! It's Homer!

1343
01:57:27,092 --> 01:57:30,637
Homer!

1344
01:57:36,768 --> 01:57:38,853
Hey, Buster!

1345
01:57:38,937 --> 01:57:41,022
Homer!

1346
01:58:00,709 --> 01:58:05,797
- I was in Maine.
- Oh, look! Here comes Jennifer!

1347
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:08,550
Let me see.

1348
01:58:08,633 --> 01:58:12,512
You're welcome. You're welcome.
It was my pleasure.

1349
01:58:12,595 --> 01:58:15,015
It's gonna be chicken
fricassee tonight.

1350
01:58:20,770 --> 01:58:23,565
- What's this?
- That's Homer's.

1351
01:58:25,358 --> 01:58:27,819
You have something for me?

1352
01:58:27,902 --> 01:58:30,655
Do I have something for you?

1353
01:58:30,739 --> 01:58:35,285
Uh, let... You know what?
I have something.

1354
01:58:35,744 --> 01:58:37,495
I do. Here.

1355
01:58:39,539 --> 01:58:41,624
It's from the ocean.
It's for you.

1356
01:58:41,708 --> 01:58:45,170
- What do you think?
- Good.

1357
01:58:45,253 --> 01:58:48,131
- I made a room up for you.
- We thought that would be more comfortable.

1358
01:58:48,214 --> 01:58:51,509
Oh, thank you. That
would be great.

1359
01:58:51,593 --> 01:58:54,679
- You're not staying in here?
- I don't know.

1360
01:58:54,763 --> 01:58:56,765
What do you think, Curly?

1361
01:58:56,848 --> 01:58:58,933
What else do you have, Homer?

1362
01:58:59,017 --> 01:59:02,646
- Do you have something else for me?
- Do you know what this is?

1363
01:59:02,729 --> 01:59:07,609
- Oh, that's my heart.
- No, actually, it's Fuzzy's.

1364
01:59:07,734 --> 01:59:09,944
There's nothing wrong
with your heart.

1365
01:59:10,070 --> 01:59:15,533
Dr Larch wanted to keep you out of the war.
That's why he told you it was yours.

1366
01:59:18,453 --> 01:59:20,914
I think he was worried
about his own heart.

1367
01:59:21,039 --> 01:59:25,377
He said it would never stand up
to Homer Wells going off to war.

1368
01:59:53,488 --> 01:59:55,699
"Thus I began my new life...

1369
01:59:55,824 --> 02:00:00,662
"in a new name and with
everything new about me.

1370
02:00:00,787 --> 02:00:03,623
"I felt like one in a dream.

1371
02:00:03,707 --> 02:00:08,086
"The remembrance of my old life is
fraught with so much want of hope.

1372
02:00:08,169 --> 02:00:11,589
"Whether it lasted for a year
or more or less I do not know.

1373
02:00:13,049 --> 02:00:15,302
"I only know that it was...

1374
02:00:15,427 --> 02:00:17,470
"and ceased to be.

1375
02:00:18,930 --> 02:00:20,974
And there I leave it."

1376
02:00:24,853 --> 02:00:27,272
Is that all?

1377
02:00:28,648 --> 02:00:30,942
No, there's much
more to come, Curly.

1378
02:00:32,068 --> 02:00:34,029
Well, that's tomorrow.

1379
02:00:34,154 --> 02:00:36,281
Let's not give the story away.

1380
02:00:46,082 --> 02:00:48,543
Good night, you
Princes of Maine,

1381
02:00:48,626 --> 02:00:51,546
you Kings of New England.
