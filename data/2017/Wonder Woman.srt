1
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,460
I used to want to\nsave the world.

3
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,050
But I knew so little then.

4
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,650
It is a land of\nmagic and wonder.

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,210
Worth cherishing in every way.

6
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,820
But the closer you get...

7
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,610
the more you see the great\ndarkness shimmering within.

8
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,270
And mankind?

9
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,360
Mankind is another\nstory altogether.

10
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,530
What one does when faced with the truth..\nIs more difficult than you think.

11
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,570
I learned this the hard way.

12
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,660
A long long time ago.

13
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,590
And now...

14
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,090
I will never be the same.

15
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,220
Yeah.. Si.

16
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,560
Hello Diana.

17
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,490
- Hello Diana.
- Hello.

18
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,380
Diana!

19
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,820
Diana!

20
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,430
Come back!

21
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,830
- Looks very good.
- Very good.

22
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,880
How is she?

23
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,170
She's good.

24
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,680
- Keep working.
- I will.

25
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,710
Niobi.

26
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,320
Diana!

27
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,430
Diana I see you.

28
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,920
Where are you going? Slow down!

29
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,030
Hello mother.

30
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,130
How are you today?

31
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,250
Let's get you back to school\nbefore another tutor quits.

32
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,840
But don't you think it's\ntime to start my training?

33
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,300
Antiope thinks I'm ready.

34
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,360
Does she?

35
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,570
I could begin showing\nher some things.

36
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,530
She should at least be\nable to defend herself.

37
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,870
From whom?

38
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,950
In the event of an invasion.

39
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,460
Isn't that why I have the greatest\nwarrior in our history...

40
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,960
leading an entire army General?

41
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,120
I pray there will never\ncome when she has to fight.

42
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,400
But you know a\nscorpion must sting...

43
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,080
- A wolf must hunt.
- She is a child.

44
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,670
The only child on the island.\nPlease let her be so.

45
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
But mother...

46
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,120
There will be no training.

47
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,360
What if I promise to be careful?

48
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,200
It's time to sleep.

49
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,190
What if I didn't use a sword?

50
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,100
Fighting does not\nmake you a hero.

51
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,020
Just the shield then\nno sharp edges.

52
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,290
Diana you are the most precious\nthing in the world to me.

53
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,190
I wished for you so much so I\nsculpted you from clay myself.

54
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,950
And begged Zeus\nto give you life.

55
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,790
You've told me this story.

56
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,900
Which is why.. tonight\nI'll tell you a new one.

57
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,710
The story of our people\nand my days of battle.

58
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,770
Yes!

59
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,990
So you will finally understand\nwhy war is nothing to hope for.

60
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,560
Long ago when time was new...

61
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,190
and all of history\nwas still a dream...

62
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,700
the gods ruled the earth.

63
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,530
Zeus king among them.

64
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,300
Zeus created beings over\nwhich the Gods would rule.

65
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,350
Beings born in his image...

66
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,210
fair and good\nstrong and passionate.

67
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,050
He called his creation "Man".\nAnd mankind was good.

68
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,250
But Zeus' son.. grew\nenvious of mankind...

69
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,620
and sought to corrupt\nhis father's creation.

70
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,090
This was Ares the God of War.

71
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,460
Ares poisoned men's hearts\nwith jealousy and suspicion.

72
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,760
He turned them against\none another...

73
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,950
and war ravaged the Earth.

74
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:13,070
So the gods created\nus the Amazons...

75
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,720
to influence men's\nhearts with love...

76
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,420
and restore peace to the Earth.

77
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,540
And for a brief time\nthere was peace.

78
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,870
But it did not last.

79
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,360
Your mother The Amazon\nQueen led a revolt...

80
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,460
that freed us all\nfrom enslavement.

81
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,760
When Zeus led the gods\nto our defence...

82
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,090
Ares killed them one by one...

83
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,450
until only Zeus\nhimself remained.

84
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,240
Zeus used the last of his\npower to stop Ares...

85
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,780
striking such a blow the god\nof war was forced to retreat.

86
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,180
But Zeus knew...

87
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,520
that one day Ares might\nreturn to finish his mission.

88
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,460
An endless war...

89
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,050
where mankind would finally\ndestroy themselves...

90
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,610
and us with them.

91
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,320
So Zeus left us a weapon.

92
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,610
One powerful\nenough to kill a god.

93
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,830
With his dying breath Zeus\ncreated this island...

94
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,010
to hide us from the\noutside world...

95
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,630
Somewhere Ares\ncould not find us.

96
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,410
And all has been\nquiet ever since.

97
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,270
We give thanks to the gods\nfor giving us this paradise.

98
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,700
And the God Killer?

99
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,500
The God Killer?

100
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,220
The weapon that is strong\nenough to kill a God.

101
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,540
Can I see it?

102
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,530
The Gods gave us many gifts.

103
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,730
One day you'll know them all.

104
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,250
This great tower.. is\nwhere we keep them.

105
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,910
The God Killer.

106
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,160
It's beautiful.

107
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,110
Who would wield it?

108
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,270
I pray it will never\nbe called to arms.

109
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,960
But only the fiercest\namong us even could.

110
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,370
And that's not you Diana.

111
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,570
You see? You are safe...

112
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,000
and there is nothing you\nshould concern yourself with.

113
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,970
You keep doubting\nyourself Diana.

114
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,400
- No I don't.
- Yes. You do.

115
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,050
No I don't.

116
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,740
You Arestronger than you believe. You\nhave greater powers than you know.

117
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,050
- But if you don't try harder...
- Diana!

118
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,890
Are you hurt?

119
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,400
No Mother I'm fine.

120
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,290
- I was just...
- Training.

121
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,220
Seems I'm not the revered\nqueen I should be.

122
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,740
Disobeyed betrayed\nby my own sister...

123
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,090
No mother. It was me.\nI asked her...

124
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,350
Take her to the palace.

125
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,640
Off you go.

126
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,000
You left me no\nchoice Hippolyta.

127
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,340
You neglect your duty\nif she cannot fight.

128
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,680
You speak of a time\nthat may never come.

129
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,780
He might never return. He could\nhave died from his wounds.

130
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,690
Ares is alive.

131
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,400
You feel it as I\ndo in your bones.

132
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,480
It is only a matter of\ntime before he returns.

133
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,280
The stronger she gets the\nsooner he will find her.

134
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,170
Hippolyta I love her as you do.

135
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,710
But this is the only way\nto truly protect her.

136
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,110
You will train her harder\nthan any Amazon before her.

137
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,520
Five times harder...

138
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,910
ten times harder.

139
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,010
Until she's better\nthan even you.

140
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,410
But she must never\nknow the truth...

141
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,070
about what she is...

142
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,820
or how she came to be.

143
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,470
Harder.

144
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,630
You are stronger\nthan this Diana.

145
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,670
Again.

146
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,500
Never let your guard down.

147
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,340
You expect the\nbattle to be fair.

148
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,100
A battle will never be fair.

149
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Anti­ope!

150
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,040
Lay still..

151
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,560
You're bleeding.

152
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,070
- I'm sorry...
- Wait Diana.

153
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,540
What had I done?

154
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,810
I'm sorry.

155
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,080
Where did this fog come from?

156
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,700
There... Go forward.

157
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,540
There he is!

158
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,270
- The pilot! I can see him.
- He's there!

159
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,290
Wow.

160
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,600
You are a man.

161
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,810
Yeah. I mean...

162
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,500
Do I not look like one?

163
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,240
Where are we?

164
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,230
Temiscira.

165
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,360
What?

166
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,940
Who are you?

167
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,930
I'm one of the good guys and\nthose are the bad guys.

168
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,140
What?

169
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,090
The German. Come on we\nneed to get out of here.

170
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,040
- The Germans?
- Diana!

171
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,800
Step away from her.. now!

172
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,890
Ready your bows!

173
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,300
They have guns. Right?

174
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,180
Fire!

175
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,520
Come on!

176
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,350
Stay down!

177
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,060
Shield!

178
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,820
No!

179
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,930
No!

180
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,700
No.

181
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,710
No. No.. Antiope.

182
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:57,460
Anti­ope hey.

183
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,310
Diana.

184
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,990
- The time has come.
- No.

185
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,930
You... you must...

186
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,230
What? What Anti­ope?

187
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,460
God Killer!

188
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,190
- Diana go...
- Go where?

189
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,180
- Where?
- Go...

190
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,610
No please no. No no!

191
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,000
- No!
- Anti­ope!

192
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:32,960
No!

193
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,810
- You.
- No..

194
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,240
No mother no.

195
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,790
He fought at my side\nagainst the invaders.

196
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:48,220
What man fights against\nhis own people?

197
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,140
These aren't my people.

198
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,480
Then why do you\nwear their colors?

199
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,530
I can't tell you that.

200
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,910
You need to tell us now!

201
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:56,900
What's your name?

202
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,660
I can't tell you that either.

203
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:03,510
We should kill him now\nand be done with it.

204
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,840
If he dies...

205
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,390
we know nothing about who\nthey are and why they came.

206
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,390
My...

207
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,570
Name is Captain Steve Trevor pilot\nAmerican Expeditionary Forces.

208
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,960
Serial number 8141921.

209
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,920
Assigned to British\nIntelligence.

210
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,430
What the hell is this thing?

211
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,440
The lasso of Hestia compels\nyou to reveal the truth.

212
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,330
But it's really hot.

213
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,340
It is pointless and\npainful to resist.

214
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,680
What is your mission?

215
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,550
Whoever you are you are in\nmore danger than you think.

216
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,090
What is your mission?

217
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,220
I am a...

218
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,920
I am a...

219
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,930
I'm a spy.

220
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,370
I'm a spy. I'm a spy.

221
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,590
British Intelligence got word...

222
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,380
that the leader of the German Army Gen.\nLudendorff.

223
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,430
would be visiting a secret military\ninstallation in the Ottoman empire.

224
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,530
I posed as one of their\npilots and flew in with them.

225
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,350
According to our Intel the\nGermans had no troops left...

226
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:37,190
no money no\nmunitions of any kind.

227
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,960
But our Intel was wrong. The German\nhad the Turks building bombs for 'em.

228
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,300
And not just bombs new weapons.

229
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,910
Secret weapons.

230
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,650
Invented by Ludendorff's Chief\npsychopath Dr.. Isabelle Maru.

231
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,990
The boys in the trenches\ncalled her "Doctor Poison".

232
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,400
And for good reason.

233
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,990
From what I could tell if Dr. Maru\nwas able to complete her work

234
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,410
millions more would die.\nThe war would never end.

235
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,580
I was there to observe and\nreport nothing more...

236
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,820
but I had to do something.

237
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,560
Which is.. I need more time.

238
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,330
Unfortunately Dr.. we\ndon't have more time.

239
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,820
This work this...

240
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,080
Get that man!

241
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,160
Now!

242
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,900
But if I can get these notes back to\nthe British Intelligence in time...

243
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,720
it could stop millions\nmore from dying.

244
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,110
It could stop the war.

245
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,410
War? What war?

246
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,120
The War.

247
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,490
The war to end the all wars.

248
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,400
Four years...

249
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:27,270
27 countries... 25 million dead.

250
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,590
Soldiers and civilians.

251
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,140
Innocent people...

252
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,060
Women and children slaughtered.

253
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,650
Their homes and their\nvillages looted & burned.

254
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,890
Weapons far deadlier\nthan you can...

255
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,830
ever imagine.

256
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,300
It's like nothing\nI've ever seen.

257
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,440
It's like the world's gonna end.

258
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,560
Should we let him go?

259
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,660
And risk him bringing\nmore men to our shores?

260
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,740
We can not hold him\nforever my queen.

261
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,710
Mother excuse me...

262
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,990
but after everything the\nman said this must be Ares.

263
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,320
What are you talking\nabout child?

264
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,790
Forgive me Senator but the man\ncalled it a war without end.

265
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,540
Millions of people already dead.

266
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,180
Like nothing he's ever seen.

267
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,120
Only Ares could do such a thing.

268
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,410
We can not simply let him go.\nWe must go with him.

269
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,940
I will not deploy our army and\nleave them scare defences...

270
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,800
to go and fight their war.

271
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,720
It's not their war.

272
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,970
Zeus created man to be just and\nwise strong and passionate...

273
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,390
That was a story Diana!

274
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,080
This much you do\nnot understand?

275
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
Men are easily corrupted.

276
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,610
Yes but Ares is behind\nthat corruption!

277
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,420
It is Ares who has these\nGermans fighting..

278
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,200
And stopping the God of war\nis our fore ordinance.

279
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,110
As Amazons this is our duty.

280
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,560
But you're not an Amazon\nlike the rest of us.

281
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,500
So you will do nothing.

282
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,670
As your queen I forbid it.

283
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,950
Strange.

284
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,470
Is it true you saved his life?

285
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,180
Who told you that?

286
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,530
He did.

287
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,020
Ah.. I didn't see you come in.

288
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,880
Would you say you are a...

289
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,540
a typical example of your sex?

290
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,070
I am...

291
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,330
above average.

292
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,300
What's that?

293
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,600
It's a...

294
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,710
Oh...

295
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,590
It's a watch.

296
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,420
A watch?

297
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,790
Yeah it's a watch.

298
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,420
Tells time.

299
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,960
My father gave it to me.

300
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,160
Went through hell\n'n back with him.

301
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,520
Now it's for me and good\nthing it's still ticking..

302
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,640
What for?

303
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,180
Because it tells time.

304
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,060
When to eat sleep\nwake up work...

305
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,560
You let this little thing\ntell you what to do?

306
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,330
Yeah...

307
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,240
Can I ask you some questions?

308
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,480
- Where are we?
- Temiscira.

309
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,260
No I got that before but I mean..\nWhere are we?

310
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,160
What is this place?\nWho are you people?

311
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,460
Why does the water do that?

312
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,930
How come you don't know what a watch is?\nHow can you speak English so well?

313
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,900
We speak hundreds of languages.

314
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,160
We are the bridge to a greater\nunderstanding between all men.

315
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,620
Right.

316
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,800
You know I didn't get a\nchance to say this...

317
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,460
earlier but thank you for\ndragging me out of the water.

318
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,270
Thank you...

319
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,200
for what you did on the beach.

320
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,180
So...

321
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,000
you are here to let me go?

322
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,870
I tried but it's not up to me.

323
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,250
I even asked them to\nsend me with you..

324
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,240
Or anyone.

325
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,610
In Amazon..

326
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,660
The Amazons.

327
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,870
The Amazons?

328
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,770
It is our sacred duty\nto defend the world.

329
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,650
And I wish to go..

330
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,480
But my mother will not allow it.

331
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,950
Well...

332
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:35,840
I can't say I blame her.

333
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,040
The way this war's going...

334
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,540
I don't wanna let\nanyone I care about near.

335
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:43,010
Then why do you want to go back?

336
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,650
I don't think "want"\nis the word right?

337
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,010
I guess I gotta try.

338
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,610
My father told me\nonce he said...

339
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,480
"If you see something wrong\nhappening in the world...

340
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,310
"you can either do nothing\nor you can do something."

341
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,980
And I already tried nothing.

342
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,140
Nice outfit.

343
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,010
Oh thank you.

344
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,860
Now.. I'll show you the\nway off the Island...

345
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,190
and you'll take me to Ares.

346
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,290
Deal.

347
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,480
I am leaving on that?

348
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,980
We are..

349
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,350
Yeah we're leaving in that?

350
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,960
Do you not know how to sail?

351
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,420
Of course I know how to sail.

352
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,410
Why wouldn't I know how to sail?\nIt's just...

353
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,880
It's been a while.

354
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,470
I am going mother.

355
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,470
I cannot stand by while\ninnocent lives are lost.

356
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:55,860
If no one else will defend the\nworld from Ares then I must.

357
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,890
I have to go.

358
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,390
I know.

359
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,170
Or at least I know I\ncan not stop you.

360
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,490
There is so much...

361
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,570
So much you do not understand.

362
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,790
I understand enough.

363
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,140
But I'm willing to fight for those\nwho cannot fight for themselves.

364
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,420
Like you once did.

365
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,030
You know that if you\nchoose to leave...

366
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,240
you may never return.

367
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,020
Who will I be if I stay?

368
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,940
This belonged to the greatest\nwarrior in our history...

369
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,440
our beloved Anti­ope.

370
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,980
Make sure you're worthy of it.

371
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,140
I will.

372
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,610
Be careful in the\nworld of men Diana.

373
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,720
They do not deserve you.

374
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,110
You have been my greatest love.

375
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,550
Today...

376
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:20,230
you are my greatest sorrow.

377
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,000
Should you have told her?

378
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:05,220
The more she knows the\nsooner he will find her.

379
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,580
How long until we reach the war?

380
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,910
The war which part?

381
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,750
The Western Front\nin France is...

382
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,150
400 miles long from the\nAlps to the North Sea.

383
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,690
Where the fighting is\nthe most intense then.

384
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,750
If you take me there I'm\nsure I'll find Ares.

385
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,700
Ares as in.. the God of War?

386
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:42,800
The God of war is our responsibility.\nOnly an Amazon can defeat him.

387
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,720
With this.

388
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,470
And once I do...

389
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,630
the war will end.

390
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,920
Look. I appreciate\nyour spirit...

391
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,860
but this war is...

392
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,870
It's a great big mess.

393
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:08,270
And there's not a whole lot\nyou and I can do about that.

394
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,140
I mean we can get back to London\nand try to look for men who can.

395
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,220
I'm the man who can!

396
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,440
Once I find and destroy Ares...

397
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,310
the German armies will be\nfreed from his influence...

398
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,900
they will good men again\nand the world will be better.

399
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,530
Great.

400
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,270
You will see.

401
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:32,650
What are you doing?

402
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,800
I thought maybe you wanna...

403
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,000
get some sleep.

404
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,870
What about you? Are\nyou not sleeping?

405
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,970
Does the average men not sleep?

406
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,010
Yes we sleep. We just\ndon't sleep with a...

407
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,300
You don't sleep with women?

408
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,360
No I mean I do I sleep with...\nI sleep with...

409
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,160
Yes I do..

410
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,790
But out of the...

411
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,910
confines of marriage.

412
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:11,470
Not polite to assume you know?

413
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,810
"Marriage"?

414
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,700
Weird! You don't have that...

415
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,350
You go before a judge...

416
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:26,160
and you swear to love honor\nand cherish each other...

417
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,360
Until death do you apart.

418
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,180
And do they.. love\neach other till death?

419
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,300
Not very often no.

420
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,750
Then why do they do it?

421
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,350
I have no idea.

422
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,180
So you cannot sleep with\nme unless I marry you..

423
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,010
I will sleep with you if you want.\nI'll sleep right there.

424
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,110
There is plenty of room.

425
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,700
- Then fine if you don't mind...
- No it's up to you.

426
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,540
- I'm just fine.
- Coming to sleep with you.

427
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,750
Okay.

428
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:15,950
You know where I come from\nI'm not considered average.

429
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,310
You know um.. being a spy...

430
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,680
You have to show a\ncertain amount of...

431
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:25,530
vigor.

432
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:32,200
Have you never met a man before?\nWhat about your father?

433
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,040
I have no father.

434
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,340
My mother sculpted\nme from clay...

435
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,760
and I was brought\nto life by Zeus.

436
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,180
Well that's neat.

437
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,890
Sorry.

438
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,380
Where I come from..

439
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,000
Babies are made differently.

440
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,900
You refer to\nreproductive biology.

441
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,610
- Yes yes.
- Yeah I know.

442
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,930
I know all about that.

443
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,010
I mean I refer to that\nand other things.

444
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,240
The pleasures of the flesh.

445
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,700
Do you know about that?

446
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:17,980
I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's\ncriticism on earthly pleasures

447
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,050
12 huh?

448
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,690
Did you bring any\nof those with you?

449
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,460
You would not enjoy them.

450
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,890
I don't know. May be.

451
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,110
No you wouldn't.

452
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,380
Why not?

453
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,020
They came to the conclusion that man\nare essential for procreation...

454
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,040
but when it comes to pleasure...

455
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,240
Unnecessary.

456
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,410
No.

457
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,720
Goodnight.

458
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,240
How long until\nwe're operational?

459
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,860
Two days sir.

460
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,750
We'll have it up\ntonight Captain.

461
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:12,090
Sir the men have had\nno food no sleep.

462
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:14,250
Do you think I have had a\nneat food or rest captain?

463
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,730
Do you hear me making excuses?

464
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:17,490
No.

465
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,430
Your men they are\nweak complacent.

466
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:22,080
You've let them forget for an\nattack can happen at any time.

467
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:23,610
From any cover!

468
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,160
So let's you & I remind them...

469
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:26,350
Shall we?

470
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:42,800
- Doctor.
- General.

471
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:44,030
Progress?

472
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,460
Not enough.

473
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,110
It is over General.

474
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,190
Germany is giving up.

475
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:54,290
Von Hindenburg has recommended\nthe Kaiser sign the armistice.

476
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:56,580
We have run out of time.

477
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,930
As soon as the Kaiser\nsees the newest weapon...

478
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,900
he will not sign the armistice.

479
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,090
But without my notebook...

480
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,680
We will get your book!

481
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,190
It is you that I\nbelieve in not it.

482
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:12,670
I know what you can\nand will succeed...

483
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,740
It is what you're put\non this earth to do.

484
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:24,730
Something did come\nto me last night.

485
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,950
A different type of gas.

486
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,090
For you.

487
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:31,540
To restore your strength.

488
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:04,310
I have got it! I have got it!

489
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,570
And if it's what I think...

490
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,730
It's going to be...

491
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,750
terrible.

492
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,320
Morning!

493
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,410
We got lucky. We caught a\nride we make some good time.

494
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:42,090
Welcome to Jolly old London!

495
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,020
It's hideous..

496
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:46,030
Yeah it's not for everybody.

497
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,660
- Good morning Darling.
- What a babe.

498
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:10,910
Oh no!

499
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:13,400
Gentlemen eyes to yourself.\nThank you so much.

500
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:17,230
Come on!

501
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,340
Why are they holding hands?

502
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,470
Probably because\nthey're together.

503
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:28,850
No... No.. We're not together\nI mean in that way.

504
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,140
This way.

505
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,240
To the war!

506
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,080
Well technically the war is that way.\nBut we gotta get this way first.

507
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,580
And where are we going?

508
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,580
We gotta get this\nnotebook to my superiors.

509
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,900
Hey! Hey...!

510
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:42,070
No. I let you go. You\ntake me to Ares.

511
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,070
- We made a deal Steve Trevor.
- Yeah.

512
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,530
And a deal is a promise.

513
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:47,670
And a promise is unbreakable.

514
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:50,630
Oi damn it alright.

515
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,410
Come with me first\nto deliver this...

516
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,270
and then we'll\ngive you a ticket...

517
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,280
to the war.

518
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,570
Deal?

519
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:01,200
- Let's go.
- Diana...

520
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:02,230
What are you doing?

521
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,670
You can not do that because\nyou're not wearing any clothes.

522
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,900
Let's go... Let's go\nbuy some clothes.

523
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,110
What do these women\nwear into battle?

524
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,490
They don't...

525
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,350
A baby!

526
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:15,850
No no.. No babies.

527
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,730
One's not made out of clay.

528
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,090
Come on.

529
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:23,320
Diana! Please.

530
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,980
Thank God! You're not dead!

531
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,280
Hurray!

532
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,610
I did think you're dead till\nI got your call you know?

533
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,560
He's been gone for weeks..\nNot a single word.

534
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,880
Very unlike him.

535
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,340
I am introducing myself.\nIt's Etta Candy.

536
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,350
I am Steve Trevor's secretary.

537
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,840
What is a secretary?

538
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:58,490
Well I do everything.

539
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:01,150
I go where he tells me to go and\nI do what he tells me to do.

540
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:03,650
Well where I am from\nthat's called slavery.

541
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:04,920
I really like her.

542
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,510
Fantastic. Ladies after you.

543
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:07,680
Oh.. I do I like her.

544
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,360
Is this what passes for\narmor in your country?

545
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,990
Ah. Well "Oh my". It's fashion.

546
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,630
Keeps our tummies in..

547
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,330
Why must you keep them in?

548
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,790
Any woman with a tummy\nwould ask that question!

549
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:34,000
Conservative but\nnot entirely unfun.

550
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:36,550
Try it on at least.

551
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:37,930
Very well..

552
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,320
No!

553
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,700
Come on!

554
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,630
How can a woman\npossibly fight in this?

555
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:02,020
Fight?

556
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,630
We use our principles.

557
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:05,530
I mean that's how we\nare gonna get to vote.

558
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,410
Although I am not opposed to\nengaging in a bitter fist stickups..

559
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,340
Should the occasion arise.

560
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,000
Lovely.

561
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,960
It's itching. It's choking me.

562
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,320
Can they blame it?

563
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,850
Etta.

564
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,130
Where is she?

565
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:26,610
She's trying on up to number 226.

566
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,530
Ms. Candy the whole point\nwas to make her look less

567
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:40,770
distracting.

568
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,290
May I?

569
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,130
Yeah really? Specs?

570
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,510
Certainly she's not the most\nbeautiful woman you've ever seen?

571
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,450
Better.

572
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:12,870
Yep that's not gonna work.

573
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:14,800
Please put the\nsword down Diana.

574
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:16,050
Diana!

575
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,270
Let me try it by myself.

576
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:19,580
After you sir.

577
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,150
Etta...

578
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,850
Why don't I meet you\nback at the office?

579
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,920
And meanwhile I'll take\nthis for safekeeping.

580
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,200
Oh no I don't think so.

581
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:38,030
You gotta put the sword down Diana.\nPlease.

582
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,030
- It doesn't go with the outfit.
- At all.

583
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,320
Put the sword down\nfirst of all.

584
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:48,320
Promise me you'll protect\nit with your life.

585
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,720
Yes... no.

586
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:52,920
You can trust her.\nJust hand that over.

587
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,090
- Shield.
- And the shield to her..

588
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,560
You got it? Thanks Etta.

589
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,800
This is easy.

590
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:02,130
There we go.

591
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,140
What is it?

592
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:35,220
Hopefully nothing. Come on.

593
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,990
- Steve why are we hiding?
- Shh! Come on come on!

594
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:58,220
Captain Trevor.

595
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,130
I believe you have something that\nis the property of Gen. Ludendorff.

596
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:06,370
Ah it's the bad guy convention.

597
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,720
Give us Dr. Maru's note book.

598
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:10,950
Where I put that thing?

599
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:13,930
Stand back!

600
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,120
Or maybe not.

601
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,200
Oh tough luck.

602
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:52,030
Is there anything else\nyou wanna show me?

603
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,720
Where do you think you're going?

604
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,960
I'm sorry but you're clearly\nunder Ares' control.

605
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:06,860
- Diana.
- Let me help you get free.

606
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:08,560
Where will I find Ares?

607
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:17,780
He's... He's dead.

608
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:20,230
Cyanide.

609
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:30,830
Stay here. I'll be right back.

610
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,710
Come on! Gentlemen please!

611
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:40,540
Let him speak!

612
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,890
Yes thank you gentlemen...

613
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:46,540
Germany is an immensely\nproud nation.

614
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,700
They will never surrender.

615
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,730
Now look. The only way\nto end this war...

616
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:55,360
Colonel I need to\ntalk to you outside.

617
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,050
And restore world peace...

618
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:00,320
is to negotiate...

619
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,710
an armistice.

620
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:05,920
There's a woman.

621
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:08,370
What is she doing here?\nGet her out..

622
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,580
Ger her out..

623
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,220
Sorry.

624
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:15,730
Blind sister she got lost\non the way to her bathroom..

625
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,910
I think it's this way.\nSorry guys.

626
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:20,590
Our only aim at this time...

627
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:23,430
must be to achieve peace...

628
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:25,440
at any cost!

629
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:31,340
Why you been not hearing speech?\nHe is talking of peace.

630
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,960
Not right now!

631
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:40,540
Trevor what the hell were you thinking\nbringing a woman into the counsel?

632
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,550
The Intel that I brought\nback is time sensitive.

633
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:44,770
This is one of Dr..\nMaru's notebooks.

634
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:45,510
Notebook or notes...

635
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,440
We need to get it\nto Cryptography.

636
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,210
And I need a immediate\naudience with the generals.

637
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,300
You do not just barge in here.

638
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:52,070
Sir with all due respect..\nWhat I saw in my last trip...

639
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:53,200
will change the course of war.

640
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,790
Captain Trevor!

641
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,640
I heard we lost you in\none of your mission...

642
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,070
and yet here you are\nback from the dead...

643
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:02,020
and I see you brought\na friend with you.

644
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:03,820
My deepest apology for\ninterruption sir.

645
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:05,480
No no no... non sense.

646
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:07,450
Thanks to this young woman...

647
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:11,100
the room was finally quiet enough\nfor me to get at least a few words in.

648
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:13,410
Sir Patrick Morgan\nat your service.

649
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:15,380
Diana princess of the...

650
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,360
"Prince". Diana Prince.

651
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:19,280
She is...

652
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:20,530
and I..

653
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:21,700
Are...

654
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:22,860
working together.

655
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:25,470
She actually helped me bring\nthis notebook back here.

656
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,280
That's from Dr. Maru's lab.

657
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,570
I think the information it contains\ninside will change the course of the war.

658
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,590
My.. God.

659
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:35,540
- Dr.. Poison herself.
- Yes.

660
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:06,940
Yes.

661
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,740
Intriguing.

662
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,370
Any further intelligence?

663
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:13,370
Sadly not sir.\nCryptography had no luck.

664
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:15,530
It seems like it's a mixture\nof two languages...

665
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:19,330
but as if they failed to\ndetermine which two languages.

666
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,200
Ottoman & Sumerian.

667
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,880
Surely someone else in\nthis room knew that.

668
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,190
Who is this woman?

669
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,140
She is my...

670
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,980
secretary sir.

671
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,710
And she can understand\nOttoman and Sumerian?

672
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:35,590
She's a very good secretary.

673
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:40,570
Sir if this woman\ncan read it...

674
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,620
we should hear\nwhat she has to say.

675
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,520
Yes very well.

676
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,350
It's a formula...

677
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:55,330
for a new kind of gas.

678
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:58,090
Mustard gas hydrogen\nbased instead of sulfur.

679
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,500
Hydrogen based...

680
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,310
Gas masks would be useless\nagainst hydrogen.

681
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,320
The book says they plan\nto release the gas...

682
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,000
At the front?

683
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:08,010
When?

684
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,380
It doesn't say.

685
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:11,330
Wait. In "front" of what?

686
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,450
Sir...

687
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:14,110
that is the evidence we need.

688
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:15,940
You have to find out where\nthey are making that gas.

689
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,310
You have to burn\nit to the ground.

690
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:18,530
Destroy it.

691
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:21,020
Ludendorff was last\nseen in Belgium.

692
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:25,400
We can't be seen in sending troops\ninto German-occupied Belgium...

693
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,860
As we are negotiating\ntheir surrender.

694
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,760
Sir I have seen that\ngas with my own eyes.

695
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:33,650
If it is used it will kill\neveryone on both sides.

696
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,530
They will all die.

697
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:37,720
Yes that's what\nsoldiers do Captain.

698
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,480
Send me in.. with some\nlogistical support.

699
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:43,500
At least give me the chance to take\nout Ludendorff's operation myself.

700
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,620
Are you insane?

701
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,080
I can't introduce rogue\nelements this late in the case.

702
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,020
Sir I can take...

703
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,510
Now more than ever...

704
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:53,450
the armistice is off\nparamount importance.

705
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:57,300
It must be negotiated\nit must be signed..

706
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,780
It's the best way of\nstopping the war.

707
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,900
Captain you will do nothing.

708
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,220
And that's an order.

709
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:07,110
Yes sir.

710
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,460
I understand sir.

711
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:11,290
I don't!

712
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,060
Diana I know this confusing...

713
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,470
- It is not confusing! It's unthinkable!
- Who is this woman?

714
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:16,590
She is with me she is with us.

715
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:17,590
I'm not.. I am not with you!

716
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:20,830
You would knowingly\nsacrifice all those lives.

717
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:22,300
As if they mean less than yours.

718
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,410
- Diana let's talk about it outside.
- As if they mean nothing?

719
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:27,440
Where I come from generals don't\nhide in their offices like cowards.

720
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,690
That's enough! They fight\nalongside their soldiers.

721
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:31,520
They die with them\non the battlefield!

722
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,250
- That's enough! My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.

723
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,320
- My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.

724
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:36,390
- Diana... Diana!
- All of you should be ashamed!

725
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,520
Please slow down!

726
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:40,920
Is that your leader?

727
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:43,310
How could he say that?\nBelieve that?

728
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:44,960
And.. and you!

729
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:47,450
Was your duty to simply\ngive them a book?

730
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:47,810
No!

731
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:49,640
You didn't stand your ground.\nYou didn't fight.

732
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,310
Because there was no chance\nof changing anything.

733
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:54,700
This is Ares and he's not\ngoing to allow negotiation

734
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,050
nor a surrender!

735
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:58,770
The millions of people you\ntalked about they will die.

736
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,160
We are going anyway!

737
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:04,360
You mean you were lying?

738
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,460
I'm a spy! That's what I do!

739
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,680
How do I know you're not\nlying to me right now?

740
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,240
I'm taking you to the front.

741
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:17,640
We are afraid you're gonna die.

742
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:20,660
This is a terrible idea.

743
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:27,100
We're gonna need reinforcements.

744
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,870
These are the reinforcements?

745
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:40,900
Yep.

746
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,990
Are these even good men?

747
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,200
Well relatively.

748
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:50,390
Even in Africa gentlemen we\nhaven't seen such luxuries.

749
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:54,700
The luxury that we have now is like...\nis like we can't stop making money!

750
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,090
So my uncle the\nPrince and I...

751
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:59,080
Which prince is that?

752
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,850
I decided to extend\nyour profanity...

753
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:03,470
But seriously which prince?

754
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,940
Hey Sultan Angoora\nNext Kashmir...

755
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:08,890
Care to talk for a minute?

756
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,590
Gentlemen excuse me one second.

757
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:14,260
- A bar... Well a pub.
- You hypocrite.

758
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:17,600
I've been racing those peacocks\nall night and you've...

759
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:19,710
Oh my goodness gracious.

760
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:21,540
That's a work of art.

761
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,810
Sameer Diana. Diana Sameer!

762
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,090
Hi Diana. You can\ncall me Sammy please.

763
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:26,930
"Sammy".

764
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:29,470
Oh Sameer I wouldn't...\ndo that if I were you.

765
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:30,820
Sameer is a top undercover man.

766
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,490
He can talk the skin off a\ncabbage many ways as you can.

767
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,500
He doesn't look that\nimpressive to me.

768
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,150
You do for me.

769
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:41,430
Your eyes as soft\nas your smile.

770
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:42,610
And your eyes...

771
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,510
looks like they want something.

772
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:47,870
I know Chinese too tricky girl.

773
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:50,160
But can you recite\nSocrates in ancient Greek?

774
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,520
Oh you're done.

775
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:54,550
Where is Charlie?

776
01:01:58,670 --> 01:01:59,670
Voila!

777
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,810
At least this Charlie\nis good with his fists.

778
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,210
That's not Charlie.

779
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,300
That's Charlie.

780
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,740
Steven!

781
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:24,730
May god grow a flower\nupon your head son.

782
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:25,870
Good to see you.

783
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,340
So what were you fighting about?

784
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,070
I mistook his glass for mine.\nThat happens.

785
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,810
This man is no fighter.

786
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:37,030
Charlie is an expert marksman.

787
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,910
Means he shoots people.

788
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,500
From very far away.

789
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:42,100
You never know what hit 'em.

790
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:46,330
So how do you know who you kill\nif you can't see their face?

791
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:48,690
I don't. Trust me\nit's better that way.

792
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,290
You fight without honor.

793
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,450
Who gets paid for honor?

794
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,210
So what's the job boss?

795
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:57,730
Two days tops.

796
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:00,350
We need supplies and\npassage to Belgium.

797
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:01,680
What's the going rate?

798
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:02,490
Better be a good pay.

799
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,710
Yeah well here's the thing.

800
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:07,820
I told you it was\ngoing to be quick.

801
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:11,520
And there's a lot to\nbe gained by this.

802
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:13,720
It's for a great cause...

803
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:16,020
Freedom.

804
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:17,960
Friendship...

805
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:21,720
ending the war friendship...

806
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,080
- Okay You have no money.
- No.

807
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:26,360
All I want now is a picture\nof that beautiful face.

808
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:29,340
You will not need a photo...

809
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:30,670
because I'll go with you.

810
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:32,750
What?

811
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,870
What is this?

812
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,230
We're gonna drop\nher up at front!

813
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,120
- "Dr..opping her off"?
- Yeah.

814
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:39,880
Question sweetheart I am not\ngonna get myself killed...

815
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:41,280
with helping every last human.

816
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:43,930
- That's no I mean.
- Here's the little thief now!

817
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,830
I am both frightened\nand aroused.

818
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:09,000
Oh here they are! Sorry I'm late.\nSir Patrick!

819
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,640
Yes that's what I\nwas gonna mention.

820
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:13,680
- Sir Patrick.
- No... No...!

821
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,160
Gentlemen sit. Ms.\nPrince sit..

822
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,910
I assume you are here\nplanning something...

823
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:25,960
that's going to get you\neither court martial or killed.

824
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:28,200
And I assume you are\nhere to stop us.

825
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:29,750
No.

826
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:32,040
Not at all in fact..

827
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:33,800
Well look.

828
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:35,000
I was an younger man once.

829
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,910
And had I been in better health I like\nto think that I might do the same.

830
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:42,440
It's very very honorable\nthing you're doing.

831
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:43,170
Therefore..

832
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:45,520
I am here to help.

833
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,490
Unofficially of course.

834
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,860
What's your plan?

835
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:54,500
If there's another weapon's\nfacility find it and destroy it.

836
01:04:54,970 --> 01:04:56,780
Along with Ludendorff and Maru.

837
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:00,450
In that case to\nallay suspicion...

838
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:05,800
our charming Etta could run\nthe mission from my office.

839
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:07,150
"Run"...

840
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,300
Also.

841
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:13,790
There is enough\nhere for a few days.

842
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:20,430
Thank you sir.

843
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:21,910
You're very welcome.

844
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:24,540
Take great care all of you...

845
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:25,560
and good luck.

846
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:48,770
Fresh ice-cream.

847
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:50,780
Hello miss would you\nlike to buy an ice cream?

848
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,320
- Me?
- You hungry?

849
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:53,570
Yes.

850
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:54,750
Thank you.

851
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:56,220
Eight pence please sir.

852
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,680
There you go and\nkeep the change.

853
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,220
Thank you very much sir.

854
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:01,880
- What you doing?
- It's wonderful!

855
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,050
Yeah.

856
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:06,680
- You should be very proud.
- Thank you very much!

857
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,080
You should be very proud.

858
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:21,360
I hope I got niches here. The\nchief's expecting us before dark.

859
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:23,620
Chief?

860
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,220
Oh yeah. A smuggler.

861
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,420
Very reputable.

862
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,820
A liar a murderer\nand now a smuggler.

863
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:33,430
Lovely.

864
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,100
Careful I might get offended.

865
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,620
I wasn't referring to you.

866
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:38,480
Really?

867
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:40,740
I wanna recover from pretending\nto be somebody else.

868
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:42,810
I shot people on your\nbeach smuggle a notebook.

869
01:06:42,810 --> 01:06:45,420
A liar murderer and smuggler.\nYou still coming?

870
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:05,970
It's awful.

871
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:08,750
That's why we're here.

872
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:28,630
The gas will kill everything.

873
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:31,080
What kind weapons\nkills innocents?

874
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:33,500
In this war...

875
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:34,770
Every kind.

876
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:43,130
You were absent at the\ncounsel meeting General.

877
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,010
I see you are negotiating the terms\nof the armistice without me.

878
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,540
- On the Kaiser's behalf.
- I'm on your insistence.

879
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:52,430
We could easily win this war if\nonly you had a little faith.

880
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:53,680
We don't.

881
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:56,040
There are shortages of food...

882
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:57,910
meds and ammunition.

883
01:07:58,910 --> 01:08:02,800
Every hour we delay costs\nthousands of German lives.

884
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,650
One attack and the\nworld could be ours.

885
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:10,050
As we speak my chemistry...

886
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:12,220
We stand against you and your...

887
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,480
witch.

888
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:19,400
Ludendorff enough!\n24 hours from now...

889
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:21,390
this war will end.

890
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,580
It is over.

891
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:26,200
It's over for you.

892
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,410
It is over for all of you..

893
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,040
But the mask won't help.

894
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:51,300
They don't know that.

895
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:07,520
Let's go.

896
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:10,190
Time to stage a demonstration\nfor the Kaiser!

897
01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:13,400
You're late.

898
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:14,830
Cowboy sneak attack chief!

899
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,170
How are you?

900
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,080
- Good to see you pal.
- Big mike.

901
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:24,320
- Good to see you.
- Oh yes!

902
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:26,720
Good to see you my friend.

903
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,700
Yah beauty!

904
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:30,500
Who is this?

905
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:39,050
And I am Diana.

906
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,490
Where did you find her?

907
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:42,920
She found me.

908
01:09:43,330 --> 01:09:45,520
- I plucked him from the sea.
- Well. It's a long story.

909
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:47,130
You don't have to talk\nabout that right now.

910
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:48,530
What's there?

911
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,820
British tea from the Germans...

912
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,040
German beer for the British.

913
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:58,130
And Edgar Rice Brurroughs\nnovels for both.

914
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:59,640
And guns!

915
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:04,410
Well... May we get what we want?

916
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:05,640
May we get what we need.

917
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,040
But may we never get\nwhat we deserve.

918
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:09,060
Bang!

919
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:17,910
Strange thunder.

920
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:20,930
German 77's.

921
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,700
Guns big ones.

922
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:25,260
It's the front out there.

923
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:30,490
- The evening hay.
- So who do you fight for in this war?

924
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,790
I don't fight.

925
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,680
You're here for profits then?

926
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,120
No better place to be.

927
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:39,590
Nowhere better to be than in a\nwar where you don't take a side.

928
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:42,170
I have no where else.\nThe last war took

929
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,840
everything from my people.\nWe have nothing left.

930
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:46,900
At least here...

931
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,690
I'm free.

932
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:51,270
Who took that from your people?

933
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:53,210
His people.

934
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,220
Don't go...

935
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:02,870
Don't go there. Do not go!

936
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:06,230
Don't go in there.

937
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,350
You are safe.

938
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:10,180
You are safe. Are you okay?

939
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:11,750
Shut up you woman!

940
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:13,530
Stop making a fuss!

941
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:15,010
God!

942
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:21,470
He sees ghosts.

943
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:27,500
Hey you're gonna get cold.

944
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,740
Oh I do...

945
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:31,670
Don't worry about Charlie. He\ndoesn't mean any alright?

946
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:53,850
These animals why are\nthey hurting them?

947
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,990
Because they need to move quick!

948
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,440
- Like us!
- But this is not the way.

949
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,070
I could help them.

950
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,380
There is no time.\nCome on woman!

951
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:05,810
Mama!

952
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:12,690
That man... he's wounded.

953
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:15,150
There is nothing you can\ndo about it Diana.

954
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:16,730
We must keep moving.

955
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:38,860
What is this?

956
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:40,970
You wanted me to take you to war.\nThis is it.

957
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:42,460
Then where are the Germans?

958
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:44,970
Couple of 100 yards\nacross the field.

959
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,660
- The trench is...
- Watch out!

960
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,350
Chief! Oh it's good to see you.

961
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:53,810
Oi chief's back! Chief's back!

962
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,280
Alright let's move.

963
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:59,250
Help me please.

964
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:01,420
They have taken everything...

965
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:03,420
houses food...

966
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:05,500
and those who\ncould not escape...

967
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,620
they were taken away as slaves.

968
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:08,860
Where did that happen?

969
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:12,140
In Veld... On the other\nside of No Man's Land.

970
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:13,240
Diana we have to go.

971
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,680
We need to help these people.

972
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:15,850
We have to stay on mission!

973
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,530
Next safe crossing is\nat least a day away.

974
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:20,320
- What are we waiting for?
- We can not leave without helping them.

975
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,850
These people are dying.

976
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:23,730
Nothing to eat and\nin the village...

977
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:25,380
- enslaved it there!
- I understand that.

978
01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:26,380
Women and children!

979
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:27,680
We need to make our next\nposition by sunset.

980
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:29,730
How can you say that? What\nis the matter with you?

981
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:32,350
This is No Man's Land! Diana!

982
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,870
Means no man can\ncross it alright?

983
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:37,300
This battalion has been\nhere for nearly a year...

984
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:39,880
and they barely gained an inch.

985
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:42,790
Alright? Because on the other side\nthere are a bunch of Germans

986
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:45,620
pointing machine guns at every\nsquare inch of this place.

987
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:48,120
This is not something you can cross.\nThis is not possible.

988
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,510
So what? So we do nothing?

989
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:51,600
No we are doing something.

990
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,980
- We are we just...
- Steve.

991
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:54,620
We can't save\neveryone in this war.

992
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:56,080
Steve...

993
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:57,970
This is not what we\ncame here to do.

994
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,420
No...

995
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:17,370
but it's what I'm going to do.

996
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:33,900
Diana!

997
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:58,380
What the bloody hell\nshe's playing at?

998
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:06,050
Engage fire!

999
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:17,070
She's taking all the fire!\nLet's go!

1000
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,650
Sniper! Stay down!

1001
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:24,200
Stay down! That's an order!

1002
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,390
Come on!

1003
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,290
She's done it! Let's go!

1004
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:41,310
Steve!

1005
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:42,890
Let's go!

1006
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,400
Come on go!

1007
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,400
Stay here I'll go ahead.

1008
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:46,220
- What the...
- Let's move.

1009
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:26,030
We need more firepower.

1010
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:43,530
Sniper!

1011
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:44,810
Move!

1012
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:47,910
Get in!

1013
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:49,620
Charlie bell tower.

1014
01:19:57,870 --> 01:19:59,140
Come on Charlie. Shoot him.

1015
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,250
It's okay.

1016
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:09,230
Follow me. Give me some cover.

1017
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:17,000
Good!

1018
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,080
We're gonna put this on our\nback and when I say go..

1019
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:21,260
- Lift hard!
- All right.

1020
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:24,450
Diana! Shield!

1021
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:29,140
Go!

1022
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:33,720
Stay very very still\nfor me my friends.

1023
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:35,380
Please. It's so important.

1024
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:40,520
Thank you very much.

1025
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:43,420
This has been such an honor\nfor me taking you photograph.

1026
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,510
Thank you so much.

1027
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:53,160
For obvious talk of shooting...

1028
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:55,260
you cannot shoot.

1029
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:00,320
Not everyone gets to be where\nthey want to be all the time.

1030
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:03,370
Me I'm an actor.

1031
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,830
I love acting.

1032
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:06,710
I didn't want to be a soldier.

1033
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:09,360
But I'm the wrong color.

1034
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:12,670
Everyone's fighting their\nown battle Diana.

1035
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:15,630
Just as you're fighting yours.

1036
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:23,280
Oh it's too much. I wish you...

1037
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,280
Thank you.

1038
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,980
Hi.. I'm on the phone...

1039
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:33,470
Ah it's "Veld" V-E-L-D.

1040
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:35,200
It's a tiny village.

1041
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:37,080
It may not even be on the map.

1042
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:38,400
Ooh! I found it!

1043
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:40,510
Did you find\nLudendorff's operation?

1044
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:42,250
No. No but I located him.

1045
01:22:42,410 --> 01:22:45,290
And oh lucky you he's\nonly a few miles away...

1046
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:47,030
At German High Command.

1047
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:49,030
The German High Command?

1048
01:22:49,150 --> 01:22:50,500
And to Intel report...

1049
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:53,000
Ludendorff is hosting a gala..

1050
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:54,530
Sort of a last Hara...

1051
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:57,360
before the Germans\nsign the armistice.

1052
01:22:57,380 --> 01:23:00,240
And then the Kaiser himself\nis going to be there.

1053
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:02,890
As well as Dr... Maru.

1054
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:05,290
Actually the Gala could\nbe perfect cover.

1055
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:07,270
- Captain Trevor.
- Yes sir.

1056
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:10,500
You're under no circumstances\nto go anywhere near that...

1057
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:12,070
gala tomorrow night.\nDo you hear me?

1058
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,630
You'll be jeopardizing\neverything we've worked for.

1059
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:16,480
You can not compromise\nthe armistice.

1060
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:18,410
- Sir there will be no armistice...
- Steve!

1061
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,410
Once Ludendorff bombs\nthe entire front line.

1062
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:21,710
Hold on one second sir.

1063
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:24,020
We shouldn't be bothered about\nsetting the peace agreement.

1064
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:25,700
- Why not?
- Ares would never let...

1065
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:27,300
What?

1066
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:28,830
What is that?

1067
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:31,200
Of course it makes\ncomplete sense.

1068
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:35,880
Ares developed a weapon\nthe worst ever devised.

1069
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:37,580
- Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
- No.

1070
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:39,540
I mean Ares.

1071
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:42,340
Ludendorff is Ares!

1072
01:23:43,230 --> 01:23:45,270
Sir this is our last chance...

1073
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:47,050
our final chance to find\nout where the gas is...

1074
01:23:47,050 --> 01:23:49,380
and to learn how Ludendorff\nplans on delivering it.

1075
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,280
No... No.. No. I forbid it.

1076
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,450
Do you hear me? I forbid it.

1077
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,200
Sir I am losing you! Sir?

1078
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:55,660
- Hello?
- Sir...

1079
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,640
How likely is he to\nrespect my wishes?

1080
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:02,950
Not very like convinced.

1081
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:10,380
Sammy Sammy no no.

1082
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:11,970
Sammy I have to work.

1083
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:15,780
I gotta rustle up with a German uniform\nI took to plough the course tomorrow.

1084
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,080
That's easy boss. Come on.

1085
01:24:17,330 --> 01:24:18,870
There's nothing we can\ndo till tomorrow.

1086
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:19,910
You said yourself Steve.

1087
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:27,190
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1088
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,630
You did this.

1089
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:49,940
We did.

1090
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:56,290
Do you have dancing on...

1091
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:58,550
Paradise Island?

1092
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:00,300
Oh dancing yeah of course.

1093
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:04,440
These people are just...\nswaying.

1094
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:08,790
Okay if you're gonna be\nfighting the God of war...

1095
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:12,210
I might as well teach you\nhow to dance you poor thing.

1096
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:14,830
Alright probably\nwithout the gun.

1097
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:20,410
If you would...

1098
01:25:21,260 --> 01:25:22,260
Well...

1099
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:26,790
If I'm going to the Gala I'll\nneed to know how to dance.

1100
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:27,950
- You aren't going to the Gala.
- Of course I am.

1101
01:25:27,950 --> 01:25:30,000
- No.
- Why wouldn't I?

1102
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:32,110
Well for one you don't\nknow how to dance.

1103
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:35,090
I would argue with this they\ndon't know how to dance.

1104
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:36,520
Be polite. Be polite.

1105
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:41,710
All right. Give me your hand.

1106
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:42,980
Like so.

1107
01:25:43,650 --> 01:25:46,870
And I'll put my arm...

1108
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:48,740
around you like so.

1109
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:51,550
And we just..

1110
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:53,290
What do you call it? Sway?

1111
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,320
We'll just sway.

1112
01:25:55,010 --> 01:25:56,580
You're awfully close.

1113
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:00,860
Nice Ritz.

1114
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:05,070
I see.

1115
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,020
I haven't heard him\nsing in years.

1116
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:35,310
It's started to snowfall.

1117
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:40,730
Touch it.

1118
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,710
It's magical!

1119
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:47,900
It is isn't it?

1120
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:51,410
Yes yeah.

1121
01:26:58,070 --> 01:27:01,470
Is this what people do when\nthere are no wars to fight?

1122
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:03,450
Yeah.

1123
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:07,490
Yeah this... and other things.

1124
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:09,160
What things?

1125
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:18,210
They have breakfast.

1126
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:20,420
They really love a breakfast.

1127
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:23,290
And they love to wake up...

1128
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:26,430
read the paper and go to work.

1129
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:29,130
They get married.

1130
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,620
Makes some babies and\ngrow old together.

1131
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:33,160
I guess.

1132
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:38,700
What is that like?

1133
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:44,270
I have no idea.

1134
01:29:19,370 --> 01:29:20,710
The villagers gave them to us.

1135
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:24,090
- A gracious gift.
- And they call us heroes.

1136
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:25,670
You are.

1137
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,030
Hey fellas I know that...

1138
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:31,220
I said this job was 2 day's...

1139
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:34,470
and a deal is a deal.

1140
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:38,070
You can't last without us.

1141
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:39,960
Yeah.

1142
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:42,340
We all know Diana is capable\nof taking care of herself.

1143
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,670
I'm worried that\nyou won't make it.

1144
01:29:45,370 --> 01:29:46,200
No more money.

1145
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:47,620
We have been paid enough.

1146
01:29:51,490 --> 01:29:52,990
No Charlie.

1147
01:29:54,370 --> 01:29:56,330
Who will sing for us?

1148
01:29:57,330 --> 01:29:59,340
- Yeah.
- Oh no please.

1149
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:01,440
Sing?

1150
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:03,830
You asked for it.

1151
01:30:04,010 --> 01:30:06,360
The reeds are green.

1152
01:30:06,830 --> 01:30:10,460
The reeds are green.

1153
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:14,250
The sweetest hours I could live.

1154
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:17,480
You must think I was\nborn yesterday.

1155
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,410
I know it sounds\ncrazy but it's true.

1156
01:30:19,670 --> 01:30:20,760
Every word.

1157
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:22,520
Wait... wait.

1158
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:24,660
There is a whole island\nof women like her?

1159
01:30:24,860 --> 01:30:26,460
And not a single man among them?

1160
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:28,800
How do we get there?

1161
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:31,010
And she thinks..

1162
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:33,160
That Ludendorff is\nAres the god of war?

1163
01:30:33,190 --> 01:30:34,980
And only by killing\nhim will the war end.

1164
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:38,330
Don't be daft. You saw\nwhat happened out there.

1165
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,430
The way she dropped\nthat machine gun next.

1166
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:42,520
The way she took out the tower?

1167
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,680
May be it's true.

1168
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:48,070
I think it's true.

1169
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:49,710
I believe it's true.

1170
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:54,400
Steven son you don't really\nbelieve those rubbish thing?

1171
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,850
Diana Diana hide in..

1172
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:24,040
How the hell do\nwe get into that?

1173
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:27,250
I see only a couple of guards\nin the door to distract.

1174
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:28,840
Yeah it won't\nlook suspicious...

1175
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,600
when I wanna come\nsauntering out of the woods.

1176
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:31,390
I could get in.

1177
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:33,580
You are not going in\nthere it's too dangerous.

1178
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,090
- Too dangerous?
- Yes too dangerous.

1179
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:36,370
And you are too distracting.

1180
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,650
Look I will go in\nthere follow them to..

1181
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:41,380
Where ever they are working on\nthe gas or better yet where it is.

1182
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:43,790
- I'm coming with you.
- No you are not coming with me.

1183
01:31:43,850 --> 01:31:45,780
What you're wearing isn't\nexactly undercover.

1184
01:31:46,310 --> 01:31:46,900
I don't know.

1185
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:49,700
I would say she was pretty\nundercover on that battlefield.

1186
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:53,230
It's just gonna we can't get you there.\nIt's all scouted out we'll put back...

1187
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:55,060
But as long as he's still\nalive it doesn't...

1188
01:31:55,070 --> 01:31:57,450
You cannot go into German\nhigh command and kill anyone.

1189
01:31:58,000 --> 01:31:59,810
You just can't. You\nhave to trust me.

1190
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:02,730
- Oh Wow!
- Where did that come from?

1191
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:05,080
Oh can I drive it?\nPlease let me drive it!

1192
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,280
Yes I'll be your chauffeur.

1193
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:07,620
Come on... come on.

1194
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:09,100
Stay put!

1195
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:11,920
Where this come from?

1196
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:13,610
A field over there.\nIt is full of them!

1197
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,540
Chief I think you and\nme scope out the area...

1198
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:21,410
in case we need to beat\nthe haste and retreat.

1199
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:22,990
- What do you say Diana?
- Huh?

1200
01:32:28,310 --> 01:32:29,310
Colonel.

1201
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:36,020
Steve they have invitations.

1202
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:39,840
Don't worry. Play it cool\nyou go this you got this.

1203
01:32:43,950 --> 01:32:45,570

1204
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:47,780
Thank you sir. The\nColonel and I wish...

1205
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:50,150
many blessings and all my\nlove to fall up in your head.

1206
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:53,910
Your head must be empty. Find\nthe invitation you idiot.

1207
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:54,810
I am sorry.

1208
01:32:54,950 --> 01:32:57,550
I am so sorry I must apologize\na thousand times my master.

1209
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:01,540
I made the most horrible the\nmost unforgivable mistake.

1210
01:33:01,830 --> 01:33:03,850
- I lost the Colonel's invitation.
- What?

1211
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,770
You saying we travelled all the\nway through the mud and rain...

1212
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:10,260
- Only for you to loose my invitation?
- No I am a bug.

1213
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,430
Not even a bug I'm\na dung of a bug.

1214
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:13,670
And you're right master...

1215
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:15,470
Blessing will up on us.

1216
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:27,370
This is ridiculous.

1217
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,620
I'm not gonna be spending\nmy evening out here.

1218
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:32,130
You stupid idiots!\nMove your car!

1219
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:55,210
What are you supposed to be?

1220
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:00,380
What are you doing?

1221
01:34:25,070 --> 01:34:26,090
Excuse me.

1222
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:30,340
I don't drink.

1223
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:39,490
Have we met?

1224
01:34:39,510 --> 01:34:41,270
No but I have\nbeen watching you.

1225
01:34:42,670 --> 01:34:44,020
Following your career.

1226
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:47,630
You are Dr... Isabel Maru.

1227
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:50,200
The most talented chemist\nin the German army.

1228
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:52,130
I am a friend.

1229
01:35:03,210 --> 01:35:05,280
I hope I'm not causing any...

1230
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:09,280
I know you and General\nLudendorff are...

1231
01:35:09,310 --> 01:35:10,270
very close.

1232
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:13,820
We work well together.. Yes.

1233
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:17,390
Tell me some one like\nme behind you...

1234
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:20,040
I could provide a lot more.

1235
01:35:20,070 --> 01:35:21,840
And who are you?

1236
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:26,130
A man who shows you appreciation\na genius like yourself deserves.

1237
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:35,390
I love fire. Don't you?

1238
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:39,420
It is like...

1239
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:43,180
a living act of entropy.

1240
01:35:43,210 --> 01:35:45,820
The ultimate weapon\nof destruction.

1241
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:48,730
Reminding us that in the end...

1242
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:52,570
everything eventually returns\nto the ash it came from.

1243
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:58,340
There is something\nreassuring about it.

1244
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:05,050
I see all of that in your eyes.

1245
01:36:08,530 --> 01:36:10,740
Perhaps you could show me\nwhat you're working on.

1246
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:28,390
I hear it is...

1247
01:36:30,670 --> 01:36:32,680
I hear it is extraordinary.

1248
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:37,270
I appreciate your\ninterest in my work...

1249
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:39,650
but I'm loyal to\nGeneral Ludendorff.

1250
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:41,460
Besides...

1251
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:44,120
Now I see your attention is...

1252
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:48,600
elsewhere.

1253
01:37:12,710 --> 01:37:14,630
Enjoying the party?

1254
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:19,460
I confess I'm not sure what\nit is we're celebrating.

1255
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:22,380
A German victory of course.

1256
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:23,390
Victory?

1257
01:37:23,410 --> 01:37:26,110
When I hear peace\ncould be so close.

1258
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:27,420
Peace?

1259
01:37:27,430 --> 01:37:29,300
It's only an armistice...

1260
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:31,110
and an endless war.

1261
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:33,230
Thucydides.

1262
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:35,280
You know your ancient Greeks?

1263
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:37,290
They understood...

1264
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:38,750
that war was a god.

1265
01:37:39,290 --> 01:37:41,970
A god that requires\nhuman sacrifices.

1266
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,240
And in exchange...

1267
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:46,000
war gives man purpose...

1268
01:37:46,030 --> 01:37:47,970
meaning a chance to rise...

1269
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,380
above his petty\nmortal little self...

1270
01:37:51,110 --> 01:37:52,430
and be courageous...

1271
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:54,640
Noble!

1272
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:59,090
Only one of the many\ngods believed in that.

1273
01:38:00,090 --> 01:38:01,680
And he was wrong.

1274
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:04,360
You know nothing of the gods.

1275
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:05,890
Herr General.

1276
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:10,570
Enjoy the fireworks.

1277
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:17,250
What are you doing?

1278
01:38:17,270 --> 01:38:18,710
- Out of my way!
- Diana look at me.

1279
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:20,680
If you kill Ludendorff\nbefore we find the gas...

1280
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:22,090
we won't be able\nto stop anything.

1281
01:38:22,090 --> 01:38:23,270
I will stop Ares!

1282
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:24,830
What if you're wrong?

1283
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:28,000
What if there's no Ares?

1284
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:31,220
You don't believe me.

1285
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,050
I can not let you do this.

1286
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:35,170
What I do is not up to you.

1287
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:43,130
Diana!

1288
01:38:47,410 --> 01:38:48,410
Diana...

1289
01:38:48,910 --> 01:38:49,910
The gas.

1290
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:52,930
The villagers!

1291
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:56,730
What they cheering for?

1292
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:00,350
Diana!

1293
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:04,350
What did they fire?

1294
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:05,670
The gas.

1295
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:07,740
- It was Ludendorff.
- I saw him he was in the tower.

1296
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:09,210
Wherever he goes you follow.

1297
01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:11,440
How will you find us?

1298
01:39:11,930 --> 01:39:13,360
I know how.

1299
01:40:31,170 --> 01:40:32,520
Diana!

1300
01:40:35,510 --> 01:40:38,180
They are dead.\nThey are all dead.

1301
01:40:39,090 --> 01:40:40,740
I could have saved them.

1302
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:43,420
I could have saved them\nif it weren't for you.

1303
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:45,630
You stopped me\nfrom killing Ares!

1304
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,220
- No!
- Get away from me!

1305
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:49,920
I understand everything now.

1306
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:51,730
It isn't just the Germans\nthat Ares has corrupted.

1307
01:40:51,730 --> 01:40:53,040
It's you too.

1308
01:40:53,730 --> 01:40:54,760
All of you.

1309
01:40:55,950 --> 01:40:57,260
I'll find Ares...

1310
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,040
and I'll kill him.

1311
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:03,500
Diana!

1312
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:05,650
That smoke...

1313
01:41:06,790 --> 01:41:07,790
it's the chief!

1314
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:09,260
He followed Ludendorff.

1315
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:12,330
Follow the smoke!

1316
01:41:38,650 --> 01:41:40,350
Hey! Diana Over there!

1317
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:57,960
Come on. Let's go!

1318
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:21,650
Ooh! What a surprise.

1319
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:23,570
Strange.

1320
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:27,060
Unfortunately I have\nanother matter...

1321
01:42:28,110 --> 01:42:29,110
to attend to.

1322
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:36,780
What are you?

1323
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:38,020
You will soon find out.

1324
01:43:12,230 --> 01:43:16,340
As magnificent as you are you\nare still no match for me.

1325
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,180
We'll see about that.

1326
01:43:46,530 --> 01:43:48,520
I am Diana Temiscira...

1327
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:52,280
daughter of Hippolyta...

1328
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:55,680
Queen of the Amazons.

1329
01:43:58,410 --> 01:44:01,150
And your wrath upon\nthis world is over.

1330
01:44:18,640 --> 01:44:21,140
In the name of all that it\nis good in this world...

1331
01:44:21,390 --> 01:44:23,990
I hereby complete the\nmission of the Amazons...

1332
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:26,080
by ridding this world of you...

1333
01:44:26,330 --> 01:44:27,340
forever!

1334
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:35,900
Diana?

1335
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:42,640
Diana!

1336
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,460
I killed him.

1337
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:52,280
I killed him but nothing stops.

1338
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:56,400
You kill the god of\nwar you stop the war.

1339
01:45:56,670 --> 01:45:58,660
Exactly what we have to do now.

1340
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:00,250
We need to stop the gas.\nCome on.

1341
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:01,920
No. All this should\nhave stopped.

1342
01:46:02,030 --> 01:46:02,980
Diana...

1343
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:05,010
The fighting should have stopped.\nWhy are they?

1344
01:46:05,010 --> 01:46:07,080
I don't know! I don't know.

1345
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:08,170
Ares is dead.

1346
01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:11,400
They can now stop fighting.\nWhy are they still fighting?

1347
01:46:11,610 --> 01:46:13,300
Because maybe it's them!

1348
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:14,720
Maybe...

1349
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:19,110
Maybe people aren't always good.

1350
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:22,030
Ares or no Ares...

1351
01:46:23,330 --> 01:46:26,650
Maybe it's just who they are.

1352
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:30,880
- Diana...
- No.

1353
01:46:31,210 --> 01:46:32,660
Diana we can talk\nabout this later.

1354
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:34,200
- I need you to come with me.
- No no!

1355
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:35,970
After everything I\nsaw it can't be!

1356
01:46:36,190 --> 01:46:37,400
Can not be!

1357
01:46:37,850 --> 01:46:39,930
They were killing each other.

1358
01:46:40,180 --> 01:46:42,710
Killing people they cannot see.\nChildren...

1359
01:46:42,990 --> 01:46:44,580
Children!

1360
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:47,160
No it had to be him.\nIt can not be them!

1361
01:46:47,410 --> 01:46:49,740
Diana people... I...

1362
01:46:49,990 --> 01:46:51,540
She was right.

1363
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:53,070
My mother was right.

1364
01:46:53,070 --> 01:46:55,120
She said the world of\nmen do not deserve you.

1365
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,020
They don't deserve\nour help Steve.

1366
01:46:57,260 --> 01:46:59,820
- It's not about deserve!
- They do not deserve our help.

1367
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,710
Maybe we don't!

1368
01:47:03,370 --> 01:47:05,540
But it's not about that.\nIt's about what you believe.

1369
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:09,350
You don't think I get it after\nwhat I've seen out there?

1370
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:14,320
You don't think I wish I could tell\nyou that I was one bad guy to blame?

1371
01:47:14,950 --> 01:47:16,630
It's not!

1372
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,480
We are all to blame.

1373
01:47:20,750 --> 01:47:21,750
I am not.

1374
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:24,960
But maybe I am!

1375
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:29,840
Please.

1376
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,060
If you believe that\nthis war should stop...

1377
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:33,880
if you want to stop it...

1378
01:47:34,210 --> 01:47:35,650
help me stop it right now.

1379
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:36,960
Because... if.

1380
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:43,660
If you don't there will be thousands more.\nPlease please come with me.

1381
01:47:43,690 --> 01:47:45,170
I have to go.

1382
01:47:51,690 --> 01:47:53,310
I have to go.

1383
01:48:05,130 --> 01:48:06,160
Hey!

1384
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:12,010
- Where is Diana?
- We are on our own.

1385
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,970
- What?
- What did you see Charlie?

1386
01:48:15,410 --> 01:48:16,990
Seems like a bunch\nof gas pumps...

1387
01:48:17,260 --> 01:48:19,590
but I can't see where\nthey're taking them.

1388
01:48:19,630 --> 01:48:21,230
How are we gonna get in there?

1389
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:24,060
I have got an idea.\nCome on guys.

1390
01:48:24,290 --> 01:48:25,290
Come on!

1391
01:48:38,890 --> 01:48:40,640
Who's there?

1392
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:55,020
Sir Patrick.

1393
01:48:55,730 --> 01:49:00,060
You were right Diana. They\ndon't deserve our help.

1394
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:05,090
They only deserve destruction.

1395
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:07,920
You...

1396
01:49:09,590 --> 01:49:11,550
You are him.

1397
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:16,420
I am.

1398
01:49:16,810 --> 01:49:21,440
But I'm not what\nyou thought I was.

1399
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:43,650
What is that?

1400
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:46,260
Future.

1401
01:49:50,970 --> 01:49:52,980
I'm not your enemy Diana.

1402
01:49:55,010 --> 01:49:58,750
I'm the only one who\ntruly knows you.

1403
01:49:58,980 --> 01:50:03,510
And who truly knows\nthem as you now do.

1404
01:50:05,820 --> 01:50:09,490
They always been and\nalways will be...

1405
01:50:09,670 --> 01:50:13,630
weak cruel selfish...

1406
01:50:13,730 --> 01:50:17,010
and capable of the\ngreatest horrors.

1407
01:50:26,290 --> 01:50:27,740
All I ever wanted was...

1408
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:32,800
for the Gods to see how\nevil my father's creation was.

1409
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:35,930
But they refused.

1410
01:50:36,250 --> 01:50:37,490
I am Diana of Temiscira...

1411
01:50:37,650 --> 01:50:39,150
So I destroyed them.

1412
01:50:39,190 --> 01:50:41,180
Daughter of Hippolyta...

1413
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:43,250
and I am here to complete her...

1414
01:50:51,230 --> 01:50:52,860
The God Killer...

1415
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:57,580
My dear Child..

1416
01:50:58,910 --> 01:51:01,430
That's not the God Killer.

1417
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:05,420
You are.

1418
01:51:08,010 --> 01:51:11,150
Only a God can kill another God.

1419
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:16,090
Zeus left the child he had\nwith the queen of the Amazon.

1420
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,590
As a weapon to use against me.

1421
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:20,490
No. You liar.

1422
01:51:22,270 --> 01:51:24,590
I compel you to\ntell me the truth.

1423
01:51:26,890 --> 01:51:28,380
I am.

1424
01:51:54,780 --> 01:51:57,130
I'm not the god of war Diana.

1425
01:51:57,330 --> 01:51:59,800
I am the God of truth.

1426
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:02,660
Mankind...

1427
01:52:03,290 --> 01:52:06,310
Stole this world from us.

1428
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:11,810
They ruined it day by day.

1429
01:52:11,810 --> 01:52:16,090
And I the only one wise\nenough to see it...

1430
01:52:17,550 --> 01:52:20,310
was left too weak to stop them.

1431
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:24,870
All these years I have\nstruggled alone...

1432
01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:27,020
whispering into their ears.

1433
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:31,840
Ideas inspiration\nfor formulas...

1434
01:52:32,750 --> 01:52:34,350
weapons...

1435
01:52:37,010 --> 01:52:39,550
but I don't make them use them.

1436
01:52:40,610 --> 01:52:42,560
They start these\nwars on their own.

1437
01:52:43,550 --> 01:52:47,370
All I do is orchestrate an armistice\nI know they cannot keep...

1438
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:49,890
in the hope they will\ndestroy themselves.

1439
01:52:51,950 --> 01:52:54,040
But it has never been enough.

1440
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:56,580
Until you.

1441
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:03,480
When you first arrived I\nwas going to crush you.

1442
01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:07,190
But I knew that if\nonly you could see...

1443
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:11,270
what the other gods could not...

1444
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:17,160
then you would join me and\nwith our powers combined...

1445
01:53:17,430 --> 01:53:21,360
we could finally end all the\npain all the suffering...

1446
01:53:21,580 --> 01:53:24,150
destruction they bring.

1447
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:29,730
And we could return this world to\nthe paradise it was before them.

1448
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:33,070
Forever.

1449
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:37,440
I...

1450
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:44,970
I can never be a part of that.

1451
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:50,870
My dear I don't\nwant to fight you.

1452
01:53:51,980 --> 01:53:53,250
But if I must...

1453
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:04,700
- Steve!
- Come on let's go!

1454
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:06,470
Sammy let's go!

1455
01:54:06,910 --> 01:54:08,400
Get these things out of here.

1456
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:42,780
Oh my dear you have\nso much to learn.

1457
01:55:07,810 --> 01:55:10,290
Oh my God!

1458
01:55:10,770 --> 01:55:12,190
What are we gonna do?

1459
01:55:13,950 --> 01:55:16,050
There is not much we can do...

1460
01:55:16,190 --> 01:55:17,820
if that's who I think it is.

1461
01:55:23,110 --> 01:55:25,050
But we can stop that plane.

1462
01:55:38,250 --> 01:55:40,150
If we could get on the radio...

1463
01:55:40,150 --> 01:55:42,730
we can ask flying\ncorp to shoot her down.

1464
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:46,030
No. If it crashes it will wipe\neveryone out for 50 square miles.

1465
01:55:46,060 --> 01:55:46,980
We gotta ground it!

1466
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:48,790
Bad news. It's on a timer.

1467
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:51,250
If we ground it here\nit's the same thing.

1468
01:55:58,290 --> 01:56:00,230
Is it flammable Chief?

1469
01:56:00,260 --> 01:56:03,730
Yes you said it's hydrogen.\nIt's flammable.

1470
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:13,310
I need you guys to clear\nme a path to that plane.

1471
01:56:13,330 --> 01:56:15,480
- No Steve!
- Hey Steve!

1472
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:18,510
Come on!

1473
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:03,540
Come on! This way! Steve!

1474
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:14,960
- Come on Steve.
- Ahead! Go!

1475
01:57:15,370 --> 01:57:16,840
Steve!

1476
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:02,890
Let's see what kind of\ngod you really are.

1477
01:58:29,350 --> 01:58:32,690
You will help me\ndestroy them Diana.

1478
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,760
Or you will die.

1479
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:50,170
Come on! Let's move let's go!\nGo. Go. Go.

1480
01:58:53,350 --> 01:58:55,350
- Now!
- Go! Run!

1481
01:59:20,410 --> 01:59:23,160
Is that all you have to offer?

1482
01:59:39,450 --> 01:59:43,370
It is futile to\nimagine you can win.

1483
01:59:44,210 --> 01:59:45,920
Give up Diana.

1484
01:59:49,950 --> 01:59:51,610
Chief! Anything left?

1485
01:59:51,630 --> 01:59:52,570
I got nothing.

1486
01:59:52,590 --> 01:59:53,900
- Anything!
- No!

1487
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:12,740
Steve.

1488
02:00:59,220 --> 02:01:00,670
Steve.

1489
02:01:03,720 --> 02:01:07,570
No!

1490
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:43,390
Yes Diana!

1491
02:01:43,790 --> 02:01:46,360
Take them all!

1492
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:49,790
Finally you see.

1493
02:01:50,210 --> 02:01:52,790
Look at this world.

1494
02:01:53,090 --> 02:01:55,900
Mankind did this not me.

1495
02:01:57,690 --> 02:01:59,760
They are ugly...

1496
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,600
filled with hatred...

1497
02:02:01,900 --> 02:02:02,980
weak...

1498
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:06,110
Just like your captain Trevor.

1499
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:12,390
Gone and left you nothing.\nAnd for what?

1500
02:02:12,780 --> 02:02:14,360
Pathetic!

1501
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:17,480
He deserved to burn!

1502
02:02:28,490 --> 02:02:32,620
Look at her and\ntell me I'm wrong.

1503
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:45,030
She is the perfect example\nof these humans...

1504
02:02:46,790 --> 02:02:50,690
and unworthy of your\nsympathy in every way.

1505
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:54,340
Destroy her Diana.

1506
02:02:55,430 --> 02:02:58,790
You know that she deserves.\nThat they all do.

1507
02:03:02,010 --> 02:03:03,370
Do it!

1508
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:09,880
Diana!

1509
02:03:13,090 --> 02:03:14,520
Diana...

1510
02:03:24,050 --> 02:03:25,050
What?

1511
02:03:25,550 --> 02:03:27,160
We have to go.

1512
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:31,400
What are you saying?

1513
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:33,010
Steve...

1514
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:35,970
Whatever it is I can do it.

1515
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:37,150
No.. No..

1516
02:03:37,270 --> 02:03:38,660
- Let me do it.
- No.

1517
02:03:38,890 --> 02:03:40,540
It has to be me.

1518
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:42,220
It has to be me.

1519
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:45,790
I could save today. You\ncan save the world.

1520
02:03:54,600 --> 02:03:57,040
I wish we had more time.

1521
02:03:57,290 --> 02:04:00,070
What? What are you saying?

1522
02:04:02,980 --> 02:04:03,980
I love you!

1523
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:17,400
You are wrong about them.

1524
02:04:27,170 --> 02:04:28,840
They are everything you say...

1525
02:04:29,710 --> 02:04:31,290
but so much more.

1526
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:32,860
Lies!

1527
02:04:59,110 --> 02:05:02,740
They do not deserve\nyour protection!

1528
02:05:04,510 --> 02:05:05,600
It's not about deserving.

1529
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:12,380
It's about what you believe.

1530
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:17,400
And I believe in love.

1531
02:05:17,430 --> 02:05:22,680
Then I will destroy you!

1532
02:05:49,890 --> 02:05:51,620
Goodbye brother.

1533
02:09:23,790 --> 02:09:26,180
I used to want to\nsave the world.

1534
02:09:27,270 --> 02:09:31,010
To end war and bring\npeace to mankind.

1535
02:09:31,770 --> 02:09:35,640
But then I glimpsed the darkness\nthat lives within their mind

1536
02:09:36,490 --> 02:09:38,760
and learned that inside\nevery one of them...

1537
02:09:39,470 --> 02:09:41,760
there will always be both.

1538
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:45,320
A choice each must\nmake for themselves.

1539
02:09:45,590 --> 02:09:49,020
Something no hero\nwill ever defeat..

1540
02:09:50,360 --> 02:09:51,610
And now I know...

1541
02:09:52,780 --> 02:09:57,320
that only love can\ntruly save the world.

1542
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:00,750
So I stay...

1543
02:10:01,010 --> 02:10:03,170
I fight and I give...

1544
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:08,130
for the world I know can be.

1545
02:10:12,710 --> 02:10:14,380
This is my mission now.

1546
02:10:17,250 --> 02:10:18,590
Forever.
