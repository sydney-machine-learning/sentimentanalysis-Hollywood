00:01:27,742 --> 00:01:29,453
- Come on!
- Slow down.

4
00:01:29,453 --> 00:01:31,100
What do you say, my River Lily?
Come on!

5
00:01:34,376 --> 00:01:35,665
Where are you taking me?

6
00:01:35,665 --> 00:01:36,539
Come on, come on, come on.

7
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:38,736
Look. Look.

8
00:01:39,084 --> 00:01:40,914
Oh, it's beautiful!

9
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:43,390
I was afraid it wouldn't
take to this soil.

10
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:45,093
But it rooted quickly.

11
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:47,718
And soon it'll be everywhere.

12
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:50,499
All across the universe.

13
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:54,199
Well I don't know what
you're talking about...

14
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:56,327
...but I like the
way you say it.

15
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:59,067
My heart is yours...

00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:00,602
Meredith Quill.

17
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:04,452
I can't believe I fell
in love with a spaceman.

Showtime, a-holes!

21
00:03:00,604 --> 00:03:02,325
It's gonna be here any minute.

22
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:03,704
Which will be its loss.

23
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:06,546
I thought your thing
was a sword.

24
00:03:06,763 --> 00:03:08,028
We've been hired to stop an
inter-dimensional beast...

25
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:10,781
...from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

26
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:13,301
It's just, swords were your thing and
guns were mine

27
00:03:13,742 --> 00:03:15,964
but I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.

28
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:19,261
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

29
00:03:20,524 --> 00:03:21,265
It hurts.

30
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:22,963
Hurts?

31
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:25,684
I have sensitive nipples.

32
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:29,349
Ha ha ha!
My nipples hurt!
Oh goodness me!

33
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:31,345
What about him?
What's he doing?

34
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,211
I'm finishing this so we can listen
to tunes while we work.

35
00:03:34,408 --> 00:03:35,366
How is that a priority?

36
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,603
Blame Quill.
He's the one who loves music so much.

37
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:39,647
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

38
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,592
That's hardly important right now.

39
00:03:42,027 --> 00:03:43,637
Oh, Okay.
Sure, Quill.

40
00:03:43,913 --> 00:03:46,477
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

41
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:49,955
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.

42
00:03:51,038 --> 00:03:52,607
I can clearly see you winking.

43
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:54,767

I'm using my left eye?

45
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,589

Come on!

53
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:23,032
Disgusting!

54
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,886
The beast's hide is too thick
to be pierced from the outside.

55
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,251
I must cut through it from the inside.

56
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,677
Huh?

57
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:33,738
No, no, Drax!
Wait a minute!

00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:34,867
Drax!

59
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:45,634
What is he doing?

60
00:07:46,004 --> 00:07:49,025
He said the skin is too thick to be
pierced from the outside, so he...

61
00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:51,223
- That doesn't make any sense!
- I tried telling him that!

62
00:07:51,494 --> 00:07:53,803
Skin's the same level of thickness
from the inside as from the outside!

63
00:07:54,063 --> 00:07:54,974
I realize that.

64
00:07:59,002 --> 00:08:00,304
There is a cut on its neck.

65
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,294
Rocket, get it to look up.

00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,541

...vanquished the beast!

70
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:14,210
What?

71
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:25,575
What are they called again?

72
00:09:25,878 --> 00:09:26,957

That's nothing like
what I just said.

75
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:34,609
But they're worth thousands
of units a piece, which is...

76
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:36,442
why the Sovereign hired
us to protect them.

77
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:39,285
Careful what you say around these
folks, they're easily offended.

78

81

Every citizen is born exactly
as designed by the community.

82
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,337
Impeccable, both physically
and mentally.

83
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:02,270
We control the DNA of our progeny...

84
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:04,092
...germinating them in birthing pods.

85
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:07,624
I guess I prefer to make people
the old fashioned way.

86
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,975
Well.  Perhaps someday you could
give me a history lesson...

87
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:14,928
...in the archaic ways
of our ancestors.

88
00:10:15,655 --> 00:10:17,586
For academic purposes.

89
00:10:17,947 --> 00:10:19,515
I would be honored.
Yes.

90
00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:20,939
In the name of research...

91
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:24,529
I think that could be...

92
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,814
...pretty uh, repulsive. I'm...

93
00:10:27,037 --> 00:10:28,155
I'm not into that kind of casual...

94
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:29,224
Please...

95
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:32,611
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.

96
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:33,573
Bring it...

97
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:35,140
...and we shall gladly

98
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:52,095
Family reunion. Yay!

99
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:54,730
I understand she
is your sister.

100
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:58,610
She's worth no more to me than
the bounty due for her on Xandar.

101
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:03,050
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.

102
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:06,735
Do with her as you please.

103
00:11:10,563 --> 00:11:12,849
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

104
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:14,628
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

105
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:19,612
My mother was from Earth.

106
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:21,406
And your father?

107
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:25,946
He ain't from Missouri.
That's all I know.

108
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,617
I see it within you.

109
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:31,338
An unorthodox genealogy.

110
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:36,243
A hybrid that seems particularly...

111
00:11:36,938 --> 00:11:38,715
...wreckless.

112
00:11:39,944 --> 00:11:43,503
You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags.

113
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:45,195
But that isn't true at all.

114
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:53,375
Ah, shit. I'm using my wrong
eye again, aren't I?

115
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:55,970
I'm sorry, that was...that was
meant to be behind your back.

116
00:11:58,114 --> 00:11:59,783
Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.

117
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:01,510
You're telling me.

118
00:12:01,765 --> 00:12:06,012
- You want to buy some batteries?
- Ha ha ha!

119
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:19,520
All right, let's get baldly to Xandar
and collect that bounty.

<i>Awesome Mix Vol. 2</i>

121
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:13,786
That stuff about my father.

122
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:15,814
Who does she thing she is?

123
00:13:16,785 --> 00:13:18,240
I know you're sensitive about that.

124
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:21,064
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.

125
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:25,485
Sorry if it seemed like I was
flirting with the High Priestess.

126
00:13:26,445 --> 00:13:27,294
I wasn't.

127
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:28,973
I don't care if you were.

128
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:31,040
Well I feel like you do care.

129
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:34,117
That's why I'm apologizing.
So, sorry.

130
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,423
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

131
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:38,595
Damn shadow.

132
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,468
There are two types of
beings in the universe.

133
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:43,207
Those who dance and
those who do not.

134
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:44,014
Mmm-hmm.

135
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:46,949
I first met my beloved
at a war rally.

136
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,180
Oh god.

137
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:51,230
Everyone in the village
flailed about dancing.

138
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,533
Except one woman.

139
00:13:53,304 --> 00:13:54,445
My Ovette.

140
00:13:55,493 --> 00:13:57,524
I knew immediately she
was the one for me.

141
00:13:57,943 --> 00:14:00,325
The most melodic song in the
world could be playing.

142
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,408
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

143
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:05,705
Wouldn't move a muscle.

144
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:08,312
One might assume she was dead.

145
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:10,472
That does sound pretty hot.

146
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:13,713
It would make my nether-regions engorged.

147
00:14:14,115 --> 00:14:15,251
Okay I get it, yes.

148
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,773
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

149
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:21,515
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic, like you.

150
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:29,723
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of that Yaro root.

151
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:31,706
No.
It's not ripe yet...

152
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,872
...and I hate you.

153
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:34,276
You hate me?

154
00:14:34,476 --> 00:14:36,402
You left me there while you
stole that stone for yourself.

155
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,966
And yet here you
stand, a hero.

156
00:14:39,516 --> 00:14:42,101
I will be free of these shackles
soon and I will kill you.

157
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:43,877
I swear.

158
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:44,944
No.

159
00:14:45,456 --> 00:14:48,004
You're gonna live out the rest of
your days in a prison on Xandar,

160
00:14:48,691 --> 00:14:50,366
wishing you could.

161
00:14:57,427 --> 00:14:57,946
This is weird.

162
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:00,075
We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.

163
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:01,028
Why would they do that?

164
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,526
Perhaps because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.

165
00:15:02,846 --> 00:15:03,733
Dude!

166
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:05,448
Right.

167
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:06,854
He didn't steal some of those.

168
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:08,696
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.

169
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,194
What were you thinking?

170
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,191
Dude, they were really
easy to steal!

171
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:24,371
- That's your defense?
- Come on!

172
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:26,820
You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.

173
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:28,927
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

174
00:15:30,183 --> 00:15:32,105
Oh, I didn't realize your
motivation was altruism.

175
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:35,223
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...

176
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,365
- ...and are trying to kill us.
- Exactly!

177
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:38,412
I was being sarcastic!

178
00:15:38,776 --> 00:15:39,253
Oh no!

179
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:42,704
You're supposed to use the sarcastic tone!
Now I look foolish!

180
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:43,652
Can we put the bickering on hold...

181
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,912
...'til after we've survived
this massive space battle?

182
00:15:46,256 --> 00:15:47,415
- More incoming!
- Good!

183
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,205
I want to kill some guys!

184
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:58,627
You're not killing anyone.

185
00:15:58,987 --> 00:16:00,404
All those ships are remotely piloted.

186
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,727
Dammit!

187
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:16,893
What is the delay, Admiral?

188
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,700
High Priestess, the batteries,
they are exceptionally combustible...

189
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:23,283
...and could destroy the entire fleet.

190
00:16:23,531 --> 00:16:25,809
Our concern is their slight
against our people.

191
00:16:27,037 --> 00:16:29,264
We hired them and
they steal from us.

192
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,836
It's heresy of the highest order.

193
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,724
All command modules...

194
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:38,883
...fire with the intent to kill.

195
00:16:48,814 --> 00:16:50,173
What's the nearest
habital planet?

196
00:16:51,652 --> 00:16:52,496
It's called Berhert.

197
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:54,145
- How many jumps?
- Only one.

198
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,875
But the access point is
47 clicks away.

199
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,876
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.

200
00:17:10,178 --> 00:17:11,294
Quill, to make it through that...

201
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:13,130
...you'd have to be the
greatest pilot in the universe.

202
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,424
Luck for us...

203
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:15,591
- I...
- I am.

204
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:29,635
What are you doing?

205
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:31,751
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.

206
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,725
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.

207
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:37,184
You were cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!

208
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:38,620
Stop it!

209
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:40,630
Quill, later on tonight, you're
gonna be laying down in your bed...

210
00:17:40,952 --> 00:17:43,083
...and there's gonna be something
squishy in your pillowcase.

211
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:44,518
And you're gonna be like,
What's this?

212
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:46,692
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there.

213
00:17:48,175 --> 00:17:50,495
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.

214
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:51,900
Oh, it won't be my turd.

215
00:17:52,536 --> 00:17:55,542
- It'll be Drax's.
- Ha ha ha ha!

216
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:58,205
I have famously huge turds.

217
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,554
We're about to die, and
this is what we're discussing?

218
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:05,710
Son of a...!
Dude! Seriously!

219
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:07,540
Hey, let me...

220
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:23,168
Idiots!

221
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:25,289
Ah! That's what you get when Quill flies.

222
00:18:28,016 --> 00:18:29,704
We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.

223
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:33,917
Our weapons are down.

224
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,577
Twenty clicks to the jump.

225
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:41,128
Hold on.

226
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:52,343
It's not ripe.

227
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:56,435
<i>SPACESUITS FOR EMERGENCY
OR FOR FUN.</i>

228
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:02,989
Come on, Zylak.
You can do this.

229
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:07,844
- Yes!
- Yes, yes!

230
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,361
15 clicks to the jump.

231
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,110
(cheers)

232
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:15,154
(cheers)

233
00:19:30,464 --> 00:19:31,330
10 clicks!

234
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:36,315
Die, spaceship!

235
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:42,470
You suck, Zylak.

236
00:19:43,061 --> 00:19:43,695
Typical.

237
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,425
It's 5 clicks!

238
00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:54,805
Son of a...!

239
00:19:55,551 --> 00:19:56,914
They went around the field!

240
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:13,028
Someone destroyed all our ships!

241
00:20:14,294 --> 00:20:14,929
What?

242
00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:18,891
Who?

243
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:21,785
One click!

244
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,702
- What is that?
- Who cares?

245
00:20:25,196 --> 00:20:26,892
That's the jump point!
Go, go!

246
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:31,279
It's a guy.

247
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:40,194
Oh my god.

248
00:20:40,764 --> 00:20:41,527
He's still out there?

249
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:10,265
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

250
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:14,811
Prepare for a really bad landing!

251
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:47,869
<i>BERHERT</i>

252
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:56,199
Ha ha ha ha!
That was awesome!

253
00:21:58,334 --> 00:21:58,998
Ha ha ha! Yes!

254
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,418
Look at this!

255
00:22:03,434 --> 00:22:04,866
Where's the other half of our ship?

256
00:22:05,368 --> 00:22:05,716
My ship.

257
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:08,747
Either one of you could've gotten
us through that field...

258
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:11,865
...had you flown with what's between
your ears instead of what's between your legs!

259
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,393
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...

260
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:18,489
...I guarantee I could've
landed this ship with it.

261
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:19,470
Peter.

262
00:22:20,026 --> 00:22:21,387
We almost died because
of your arrogance.

263
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,156
No, like, because he stole...

264
00:22:23,499 --> 00:22:24,509
...Anulax batteries.

265
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:26,644
They're called Harbulary batteries.

266
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:28,601
No, they're not!

267
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,448
You know why I did it,
Star-Munch?  Hmm?

268
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,663
I'm not gonna answer
to Star-Munch.

269
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:35,567
- I did it because I wanted to!
- Dick.

270
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:37,525
What are we even talking
about this for?

271
00:22:37,913 --> 00:22:40,632
We just had a little man save
us by blowing up 50 ships!

272
00:22:40,632 --> 00:22:41,484
How little?

273
00:22:42,137 --> 00:22:43,295
I, I don't know, like this?

274
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:45,544
A little one-inch man saved us?

275
00:22:45,955 --> 00:22:47,958
Well, if he got closer, I'm
sure he'd be much larger.

276
00:22:48,272 --> 00:22:50,109
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.

277
00:22:50,518 --> 00:22:51,518
Don't call me a raccoon!

278
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,979
I'm sorry.
I took it too far.

279
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:56,947
I meant trash panda.

280
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:00,280
Is that better?

281
00:23:01,268 --> 00:23:02,382
I don't know.

282
00:23:03,045 --> 00:23:04,769
It's worse.  It's so much worse.

283
00:23:05,395 --> 00:23:06,191
You son of a...!

284
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:06,871
Hey!

285
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,169
- I've about had it with you!
- No! Back off!

286
00:23:09,378 --> 00:23:10,652
Someone followed you
through the jump point.

287
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:14,708
Set me free.
You'll need my help.

288
00:23:15,052 --> 00:23:16,333
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

289
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:18,256
You are a fool to deprive
yourself a hand in combat.

290
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:19,590
You'll attack me the moment
I let you go.

291
00:23:19,937 --> 00:23:20,728
No I won't.

292
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:23,885
You would think an evil super-villain
would learn how to properly lie.

293
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:25,836
I bet it's the one-inch man..

294
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,356
After all these years,
I've found you.

295
00:24:03,016 --> 00:24:03,918
And who the hell are you?

296
00:24:05,532 --> 00:24:07,960
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.

297
00:24:10,047 --> 00:24:11,572
My name is Ego.

298
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:14,870
And I'm your dad, Peter.

299
00:24:19,696 --> 00:24:23,378
<i>CONTRAXIA</i>

300
00:24:31,582 --> 00:24:32,651
You know what they say.

301
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:35,028
You're out of luck
until you've gone duck.

302
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:03,116
Yondu!

303
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:05,834
Come on down!

304
00:25:18,489 --> 00:25:20,470
(faroff conversation)

305
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:22,474
...this woman, I ended up marrying her.

306
00:25:22,895 --> 00:25:25,247
I said, Aleta, I love you...

307
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,959
...but you're losing your mind!

308
00:25:27,285 --> 00:25:28,990
And she's always been this way.

309
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,317
I could never trust her, you know.

310
00:25:31,317 --> 00:25:31,910
Stakar.

311
00:25:36,513 --> 00:25:37,647
It's been some time.

312
00:25:42,302 --> 00:25:45,894
Seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

313
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:53,664
Stakar.

314
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:55,866
There's 100 Ravager factions.

315
00:25:56,147 --> 00:25:58,868
You just lost the business of 99
of them by serving one.

316
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,667
Please, sir.
Please!

317
00:26:01,048 --> 00:26:01,978
Get away from me.

318
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:08,739
You can go to hell then!

319
00:26:10,727 --> 00:26:12,850
I don't give a damn what
you think of me!

320
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,538
So, what are you following us for?

321
00:26:14,848 --> 00:26:16,406
You're gonna listen to
what I gotta say!

322
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:18,965
I don't gotta listen to nothing!
You betrayed the code!

323
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:21,437
Ravager's don't deal in kids!

324
00:26:21,437 --> 00:26:24,102
I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!

325
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,012
You didn't know 'cause you didn't
want to know 'cause it made you rich.

326
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:31,593
I demand a seat at the table.
I wear these flames, same as you.

327
00:26:31,853 --> 00:26:33,168
You may dress like us...

328
00:26:33,485 --> 00:26:35,883
...but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

329
00:26:36,572 --> 00:26:37,908
And the Colors of Orgord...

330
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:41,316
...will never lash over your grave.

331
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:43,997
If you think...

332
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,897
I take pleasure in exiling you...

333
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,774
...you're wrong.

334
00:26:53,685 --> 00:26:55,611
You broke all all our hearts.

335
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:12,665
Pathetic.

336
00:27:14,698 --> 00:27:16,899
First, Quill betrays us...

337
00:27:17,223 --> 00:27:18,663
...and Yondu just lets
him go scott-free.

338
00:27:20,614 --> 00:27:21,551
We followed him...

339
00:27:22,186 --> 00:27:25,292
...because he was the one who wasn't
afraid to do what needed to be done.

340
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:27,803
Seems he's going soft.

341
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:31,326
If he's so soft,
why are you whispering for?

342
00:27:32,132 --> 00:27:33,741
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

343
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:38,490
You best be very careful what
you say about our captain.

344
00:27:38,849 --> 00:27:39,877
Who is that?

345
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:21,551
Yondu Udonta.

346
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,210
I have a proposition for you.

347
00:28:25,445 --> 00:28:27,568
I hired Yondu to pick you up...

348
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:29,176
...when your mother passed away.

349
00:28:29,662 --> 00:28:31,088
But, instead of returning you...

350
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:32,916
...Yondu kept you.

351
00:28:33,774 --> 00:28:35,566
I have no clue as to why.

352
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,344
Well, I'll tell you why.

353
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:41,960
'Cause I was a skinny little kid who
could squeeze into places adults couldn't.

354
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:43,397
It made it easier for thieving.

355
00:28:43,982 --> 00:28:46,154
Well. I've been trying to
track you down ever since.

356
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:48,832
I thought Yondu was your father.

357
00:28:49,434 --> 00:28:51,329
What?  We've been together
this whole time...

358
00:28:51,676 --> 00:28:53,297
...and you thought Yondu was
my actual blood relative?

359
00:28:54,611 --> 00:28:55,721
You look exactly alike.

360
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:57,091
One's blue!

361
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:00,808
No, he's not my father!

362
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,943
Yondu is the guy
who abducted me.

363
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,273
Kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight.

364
00:29:05,713 --> 00:29:07,439
And kept me in terror by
threatening to eat me.

365
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:08,764
- Eat you?
- Yeah.

366
00:29:09,487 --> 00:29:10,684
Ah, that son of a bitch!

367
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:12,846
How did you locate us now?

368
00:29:13,764 --> 00:29:16,770
Well, even where I reside, out
past the edge what's known...

369
00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:19,030
...we've heard tell about the
man they call Star-Lord.

370
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:20,962
What say we head out there right now?

371
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:24,046
Your associates are welcome.
Even that triangle-face monkey, there.

372
00:29:25,551 --> 00:29:26,250
I promise you...

373
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:29,029
...it's not like any other
place you've ever seen.

374
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:31,031
And there...

375
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:35,275
I can explain your very
special heritage.

376
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:37,699
Finally get to be the...

377
00:29:38,472 --> 00:29:39,532
...father I've always wanted to be.

378
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:43,450
Excuse me.

379
00:29:44,968 --> 00:29:45,709
I've gotta take a whiz.

380
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:53,017
I'm not buying it.

381
00:29:56,287 --> 00:29:57,063
Let's go take a walk.

382
00:30:04,878 --> 00:30:05,547
I am Mantis.

383
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:10,879
What are you doing?

384
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:12,498
Smiling.

385
00:30:14,006 --> 00:30:16,352
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.

386
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:18,674
Not if you do it like that.

387
00:30:19,604 --> 00:30:23,134
Oh.
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

388
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,441
I do not understand the
intricacies of social interaction.

389
00:30:30,743 --> 00:30:33,217
Can I pet your puppy?
It's adorable.

390
00:30:37,684 --> 00:30:38,239
Yes.

391
00:30:43,743 --> 00:30:47,511
Ha ha ha ha!

392
00:30:47,743 --> 00:30:50,511
That is called a practical joke!

393
00:30:54,184 --> 00:30:55,636
I liked it very much!

394
00:30:57,071 --> 00:30:58,544
I just made it up.

395
00:31:02,632 --> 00:31:03,199
Give me a break!

396
00:31:03,506 --> 00:31:05,614
After all this time, you're gonna
show up and just all of a sudden...

397
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:07,205
- ...you want to be my dad?
- I hear you.

398
00:31:07,771 --> 00:31:08,764
You know, by the way,
this could be a trap.

399
00:31:09,253 --> 00:31:11,147
Ok? The Kree ~Perus, the Ravagers...

400
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:12,834
- ...they all want us dead.
- I know, but...

401
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,425
But, what?

402
00:31:14,794 --> 00:31:17,033
What was that story you told
me about Zardu Hasselfrau?

403
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:17,993
Who?

404
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,756
He owned a magic boat.

405
00:31:21,607 --> 00:31:22,520
David Hasselhoff?

406
00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:23,727
Right.

407
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,829
Not in a magic boat.
A talking car.

408
00:31:26,168 --> 00:31:27,290
Why did he talk, again?

409
00:31:27,647 --> 00:31:30,248
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.

410
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:33,438
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...

411
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,271
and you would tell all
the other children...

412
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:37,782
...that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.

413
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:40,444
Shooting Knight Rider or touring
with his band in Germany.

414
00:31:40,788 --> 00:31:42,907
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing it up now?

415
00:31:43,205 --> 00:31:44,046
I love that story.

416
00:31:44,431 --> 00:31:45,708
I hate that story.

417
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,361
It's so sad!

418
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:52,239
As a kid, I used to see all the other
kids all playing catch with their dad.

419
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,537
And I wanted that, more than
anything in the world.

420
00:31:55,911 --> 00:31:57,679
That's my point, Peter.

421
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:01,717
What if this man
is your Hasselhoff?

422
00:32:05,996 --> 00:32:07,230
Listen.  If he ends
up being evil...

423
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,404
...we'll just kill him.

424
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:19,280
You're leaving me with that fox?

425
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:20,928
He's not a fox.

426
00:32:21,442 --> 00:32:22,806
Shoot her if she does
anything suspicious.

427
00:32:23,795 --> 00:32:26,214
- Or if you feel like it.
- Okay.

428
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:29,175
Hey. It'll be just a
couple of days.

429
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,992
We'll be back before Rocket's
finished fixing the ship.

430
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,423
What if Sovereign come?

431
00:32:38,102 --> 00:32:39,940
There's no way for them to
know we're here.  Let's go.

432
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:42,152
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

433
00:32:42,566 --> 00:32:43,786
God, you're like an old woman.

434
00:32:44,138 --> 00:32:44,968
Because I'm wise?

435
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:48,188
Why do you have so much luggage?

436
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,322
I don't want Groot
playing with my things.

437
00:32:54,248 --> 00:32:56,893
I hope daddy isn't as big of a
dick as you, orphan boy.

438
00:32:58,947 --> 00:33:02,663
What is your goal here?
To get everbody to hate you?

439
00:33:03,385 --> 00:33:04,181
Because it's working.

440
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,207
Hey. Can I ask you a
personal question?

441
00:33:56,755 --> 00:33:59,000
Oh! Noone has ever asked
me a personal question.

442
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:00,860
Your antennae, what are they for?

443
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:02,721
Their purpose?

444
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:04,471
Yes, Quill and I have a bet.

445
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:07,099
Ugh. You're not supposed to say that.

446
00:34:08,104 --> 00:34:08,801
I say...

447
00:34:09,169 --> 00:34:10,686
that if you're about to go through
a doorway that's too low...

448
00:34:11,502 --> 00:34:14,450
...the antennae will feel this and
keep you from being decapitated.

449
00:34:14,764 --> 00:34:16,840
Right.
And if it's anything other than...

450
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:20,213
...you specifically not being
decapitated by a doorway, I win.

451
00:34:20,574 --> 00:34:23,003
They are not for feeling doorways.

452
00:34:25,036 --> 00:34:25,808
I think...

453
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,271
...they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.

454
00:34:29,607 --> 00:34:30,149
What are those?

455
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:34,312
If I touch someone, I can
feel their feelings.

456
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:36,267
- You read minds?
- No.

457
00:34:37,098 --> 00:34:38,794
Telepaths know thoughts.

458
00:34:39,737 --> 00:34:41,405
Empaths feel feelings.

459
00:34:43,368 --> 00:34:44,124
Emotions.

460
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,166
May I?

461
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:49,957
Oh, all right.

462
00:34:58,932 --> 00:35:00,842
You feel love.

463
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:05,863
Yeah, I guess feel a general
unselfish love for just about everybody...

464
00:35:06,379 --> 00:35:07,133
No!

465
00:35:07,585 --> 00:35:09,745
Romantic, sexual love.

466
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:10,821
No. No I don't.

467
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:11,990
- For her!
- No!

468
00:35:12,662 --> 00:35:15,382
- That is not...
- Aaa ha ha ha!!

469
00:35:15,807 --> 00:35:16,162
Okay.

470
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:22,179
She just told everyone
your deepest, darkest secret!

471
00:35:22,815 --> 00:35:24,471
Dude, come on, I think you're
overreacting a little bit.

472
00:35:24,851 --> 00:35:27,309
You must be so embarrassed!
Aha ha ha ha!

473
00:35:28,853 --> 00:35:30,589
Do me!
Do me! Do me!

474
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:41,028
I have never felt such humor.
(both laughing hysterically)

475
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:44,830
So unbelievably not cool.

476
00:35:47,553 --> 00:35:48,163
Quill.

477
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,375
Touch me, and the only thing you're
gonna feel is a broken jaw.

478
00:36:00,471 --> 00:36:04,013
I can also alter emotions,
to some extent.

479
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:05,527
Yeah, like what?

480
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:07,753
If I touch someone who is sad...

481
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:11,300
...I can ease them into
contentment for a short while.

482
00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:15,094
I can make a stubborn person compliant.

483
00:36:16,271 --> 00:36:18,719
But I mostly use it to
help my master sleep.

484
00:36:19,447 --> 00:36:23,191
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.

485
00:36:25,509 --> 00:36:26,507
Do one of those on me.

486
00:36:31,167 --> 00:36:31,877
Sleep.

487
00:37:25,903 --> 00:37:26,956
I love this song.

488
00:37:59,195 --> 00:37:59,993
There!

489
00:39:20,536 --> 00:39:22,980
Ain't so tough now,
without all your toys.

490
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:24,233
Are ya?

491
00:39:27,276 --> 00:39:28,061
Move!

492
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:45,792
Crap.

493
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,659
Hey there, rat!

494
00:39:53,468 --> 00:39:54,845
How's it going, you blue idiot?

495
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:56,968
Not so bad.

496
00:39:58,483 --> 00:40:00,565
We got ourselves a pretty
good little gig here.

497
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,715
This golden gal with quite a
high opinion of herself...

498
00:40:03,991 --> 00:40:07,954
...has offered us a large sum to
deliver you and your pals over to her...

499
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,344
...'cause she wants to kill y'all.

500
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:11,886
Your Friend...

501
00:40:12,378 --> 00:40:13,363
There's too many of them.

502
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,925
He needs my help.
If you care about him...

503
00:40:17,677 --> 00:40:19,732
...you need to get
me out of these bonds.

504
00:40:20,747 --> 00:40:21,803
They are going to kill him!

505
00:40:22,746 --> 00:40:24,861
I'll tell you, it was
pretty easy to find you.

506
00:40:25,171 --> 00:40:26,566
I put a tracer on
your ship back there...

507
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,014
...during the war with Xandar.

508
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,734
Give me your word you
won't hurt Groot...

509
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:33,062
...and I'll tell you
where the batteries are.

510
00:40:34,302 --> 00:40:36,222
Lucky for you, my
word don't mean squat.

511
00:40:37,426 --> 00:40:39,116
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

512
00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:41,348
Otherwise...what?

513
00:40:42,187 --> 00:40:43,433
We'll take them batteries.

514
00:40:43,845 --> 00:40:46,669
They're worth, what, a
quarter mil on the open market?

515
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,169
That Priestess offered
us a million.

516
00:40:49,988 --> 00:40:52,210
A quarter is only one third of that!

517
00:40:52,893 --> 00:40:54,318
A quarter ain't a third.

518
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:55,776
A quarter is 25.

519
00:40:56,158 --> 00:40:56,807
No.

520
00:40:57,062 --> 00:40:59,630
We can't even buy a pair
of boots with 25 units.

521
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:00,533
Enough!

522
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,842
The point is, we ain't stupid enough to
help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

523
00:41:06,061 --> 00:41:07,907
The whole dang Nova Corps'd be on us.

524
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,928
That ain't right!

525
00:41:11,355 --> 00:41:12,852
I just gotta say it this
one time, captain.

526
00:41:14,701 --> 00:41:16,636
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...

527
00:41:17,216 --> 00:41:19,587
...you protect him like none
of the rest of us much matter.

528
00:41:21,252 --> 00:41:22,534
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

529
00:41:23,097 --> 00:41:23,920
Take it easy, Kraglin.

530
00:41:24,236 --> 00:41:26,022
Damn straight, lads.
He's gone soft.

531
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:29,160
I suppose it's time for
a change in leadership.

532
00:41:34,844 --> 00:41:36,060
Put your ~gob guns down!

533
00:41:37,376 --> 00:41:38,515
Whoa! Whoa!

534
00:41:38,983 --> 00:41:41,115
There must be some kind of
peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

535
00:41:42,071 --> 00:41:44,282
Or even a violent one, where
I'm standing over there.

536
00:42:04,383 --> 00:42:05,544
Well, hello boys.

537
00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:12,389
It's not ripe.

538
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:40,189
<i>EGO'S PLANET</i>

539
00:42:57,993 --> 00:43:00,433
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

540
00:43:01,513 --> 00:43:03,900
Wow. You have your own planet?

541
00:43:04,222 --> 00:43:07,061
Come on.  It's no larger
than your Earth's moon.

542
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,041
Humility.

543
00:43:09,773 --> 00:43:10,409
I like it.

544
00:43:11,447 --> 00:43:13,344
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

545
00:43:56,169 --> 00:43:59,797
You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships without a suit.

546
00:44:01,069 --> 00:44:01,944
What are you exactly?

547
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,853
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.

548
00:44:08,663 --> 00:44:10,407
A Celestial, like a God?

549
00:44:12,955 --> 00:44:14,042
Oh, a small "g", son.

550
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,869
At least on the days I'm
feeling as humble as Drax.

551
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:34,585
I don't know where I came from, exactly.

552
00:44:35,767 --> 00:44:37,712
The first thing I remember is...

553
00:44:37,712 --> 00:44:40,265
...flickering. Adrift in
the cosmos, utterly...

554
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:43,626
...and entirely alone.

555
00:44:44,763 --> 00:44:46,409
Over millions of years...

556
00:44:46,736 --> 00:44:49,937
...I learned to control
the molecules around me.

557
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:53,561
I grew smarter and stronger.

558
00:44:55,789 --> 00:44:58,755
And I continued building from there.

559
00:44:59,075 --> 00:45:00,242
Layer by layer...

560
00:45:01,072 --> 00:45:03,181
...the very planet you walk on now.

561
00:45:04,117 --> 00:45:04,938
Whoa.

562
00:45:05,987 --> 00:45:07,064
But I wanted more.

563
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:09,031
I desired...

564
00:45:10,346 --> 00:45:11,146
...meaning.

565
00:45:12,653 --> 00:45:15,800
There must be some life out
there in the universe...

566
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:18,931
...besides just me, I thought.

567
00:45:19,477 --> 00:45:22,761
And so, I set myself to task
for finding it.

568
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:25,624
I created...

569
00:45:25,911 --> 00:45:28,230
...what I imagined biological
life to be like...

570
00:45:28,922 --> 00:45:32,687
...down to the most minute detail.

571
00:45:34,483 --> 00:45:35,351
Did you make a penis?

572
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:36,456
Dude!

573
00:45:37,388 --> 00:45:38,242
What is wrong with you?

574
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:41,313
If he is a planet, how could he
make a baby with your mother?

575
00:45:42,051 --> 00:45:43,773
He would smush her!

576
00:45:45,003 --> 00:45:46,683
I...ugh!  I don't need to hear
how my parents...

577
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:49,202
Why?

578
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:53,781
My father would tell the story of
impregnating my mother every winter solstice.

579
00:45:54,063 --> 00:45:54,982
That's disgusting.

580
00:45:55,728 --> 00:45:56,252
It was beautiful.

581
00:45:58,317 --> 00:45:59,910
You Earthers have hang-ups.

582
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:02,247
Yes, Drax.
I got a penis.

583
00:46:03,487 --> 00:46:04,090
Ha! Thank you.

584
00:46:04,584 --> 00:46:06,229
- And it's not half bad.
- Huh!

585
00:46:06,944 --> 00:46:10,185
I also have pain receptors
and a digestive system...

586
00:46:11,106 --> 00:46:12,867
...and all the accompanying junk.

587
00:46:13,442 --> 00:46:17,532
I wanted to experience what it
truly meant to be human.

588
00:46:18,274 --> 00:46:20,148
As I set out amongst the stars...

589
00:46:21,665 --> 00:46:23,716
...'til I found...

590
00:46:24,103 --> 00:46:25,501
...what I sought.

591
00:46:27,434 --> 00:46:28,379
Life.

592
00:46:30,396 --> 00:46:33,019
I was not alone in the
universe after all.

593
00:46:39,373 --> 00:46:40,542
When did you meet my mother?

594
00:46:45,424 --> 00:46:46,430
Not long after.

595
00:46:53,114 --> 00:46:57,223
It was, with Meredith, that I
first experienced love.

596
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,747
I called her my River Lily.

597
00:47:09,232 --> 00:47:10,718
And from that love, Peter...

598
00:47:15,106 --> 00:47:15,807
You.

599
00:47:23,515 --> 00:47:25,875
I've searched for you for so long.

600
00:47:28,686 --> 00:47:30,919
And when I heard of
a man from Earth...

601
00:47:31,263 --> 00:47:33,146
...who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...

602
00:47:35,334 --> 00:47:38,080
...I knew you must be the
son of the woman I loved.

603
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,914
If you loved her, why
did you leave her?

604
00:48:04,093 --> 00:48:05,860
You should ~?

605
00:48:06,602 --> 00:48:08,224
You should ~?

606
00:48:09,016 --> 00:48:10,244
You should ~?

607
00:48:23,671 --> 00:48:24,649
Sorry about this!

608
00:49:00,644 --> 00:49:01,390
Captain!

609
00:49:01,711 --> 00:49:03,045
Help me!
Please help!

610
00:49:04,249 --> 00:49:04,879
Captain!

611
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:10,563
You're the one what killed those men...

612
00:49:11,378 --> 00:49:12,869
...by leading them
down the wrong path.

613
00:49:14,065 --> 00:49:15,063
Because you're weak.

614
00:49:18,286 --> 00:49:19,001
And stupid!

615
00:49:22,086 --> 00:49:23,738
It's time for the Ravengers...

616
00:49:24,264 --> 00:49:27,767
...to rise once again to glory
with a new captain...

617
00:49:28,449 --> 00:49:31,043
Taserface!

618
00:49:34,935 --> 00:49:36,472
Aha ha ha ha!

619
00:49:37,935 --> 00:49:40,472
I'm sorry.
Your name is...

620
00:49:41,618 --> 00:49:42,674
...it's Taserface?

621
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,313
That's right.

622
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:47,821
Do you shoot tasers
out of your face?

623
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:49,914
It's metaphorical!

624
00:49:50,627 --> 00:49:51,349
Yeah!

625
00:49:54,977 --> 00:49:55,602
For what?

626
00:49:58,388 --> 00:50:01,252
For...
It is a name what strikes fear...

627
00:50:01,604 --> 00:50:03,242
...into the hearts of
anyone what hears it!

628
00:50:06,558 --> 00:50:07,066
Okay.

629
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:09,462
Okay...

630
00:50:09,767 --> 00:50:10,769
Whatever you say.

631
00:50:11,594 --> 00:50:12,261
You shut up.

632
00:50:12,696 --> 00:50:13,628
You're next.

633
00:50:14,592 --> 00:50:18,708
Udonta, I've been
waiting a long time to...

634
00:50:18,991 --> 00:50:19,549
What?

635
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:23,569
(snickering) I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

636
00:50:23,986 --> 00:50:26,301
I just keep imagining
you waking up in the morning, sir...

637
00:50:26,795 --> 00:50:29,777
...looking in the mirror and,
in all seriousness, saying to yourelf...

638
00:50:30,064 --> 00:50:34,326
You know what would be a really
kick-ass name? Taserface!

639
00:50:35,654 --> 00:50:40,125
Ah ha ha!
That's how I hear you in my head!
I can't take it anymore!

640
00:50:40,492 --> 00:50:42,815
What was your second choice?

641
00:50:42,931 --> 00:50:44,906
- Scrotum Hat?
- (everyone laughs)

642
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:48,150
New plan.
We're killing you first.

643
00:50:50,156 --> 00:50:52,088
Well.  Dying is certainly better than
having to live an entire life...

644
00:50:52,412 --> 00:50:57,070
...as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.

645
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,973
That's enough killing for today.

646
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:05,620
She's the daughter of Thanos.

647
00:51:08,591 --> 00:51:10,783
I thought you were the biggest
sadist in the galaxy.

648
00:51:11,087 --> 00:51:12,577
That was when daddy was
paying my bills.

649
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,537
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.

650
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,137
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.

651
00:51:22,177 --> 00:51:23,006
I assure you...

652
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:26,214
I am not as easy a mark as an
old man without his magic stick...

653
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,075
...or a talking woodland beast.

654
00:51:29,893 --> 00:51:31,379
I want ten percent of the take.

655
00:51:33,378 --> 00:51:34,885
And a couple more things.

656
00:51:37,286 --> 00:51:38,184
We got a whole box of hands...

657
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,241
- ...if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.

658
00:51:40,746 --> 00:51:43,945
You, uh, think them Kree is
gonna execute the captain?

659
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:47,099
The Kree consider themselves
merciful.  It will be painless.

660
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:51,733
Well, uh, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.

661
00:51:52,198 --> 00:51:53,729
The location of Ego's planet
in the nav.

662
00:51:54,049 --> 00:51:56,028
We'll wire you the ten percent
once we's paid.

663
00:51:56,525 --> 00:51:57,869
What're you gonna do
with your share?

664
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:02,894
As a child, my father would have Gamora
and me battle one another in training.

665
00:52:04,486 --> 00:52:06,084
Every time my sister prevailed...

666
00:52:06,795 --> 00:52:08,982
...my father would replace a
piece of me with machinery...

667
00:52:10,398 --> 00:52:12,734
...claiming he wanted me
to be her equal.

668
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:15,485
But she won.

669
00:52:16,162 --> 00:52:20,867
Again and again and again,
never once refraining.

670
00:52:22,548 --> 00:52:23,983
So, after I murder my sister...

671
00:52:24,986 --> 00:52:28,241
...I will buy a warship will every
conceivable instrument of death.

672
00:52:28,505 --> 00:52:31,708
I will hunt my father like a
dog and I will tear him apart slowly...

673
00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:33,304
...piece by piece...

674
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:37,285
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...

675
00:52:37,575 --> 00:52:39,933
...I know every single day.

676
00:52:42,218 --> 00:52:43,089
Yeah...

677
00:52:44,255 --> 00:52:45,904
...I was talking about
a pretty necklace.

678
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:47,629
Or a nice hat, you know.

679
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:51,416
Something to make the other
girls go, Ooooh, that's nice.

680
00:52:55,511 --> 00:52:57,795
Anyways, happy trails.

681
00:53:06,701 --> 00:53:08,915
My mother told everyone my
father was from the stars.

682
00:53:11,932 --> 00:53:14,191
She had brain cancer, so
everyone thought she was delusional.

683
00:53:14,454 --> 00:53:15,120
Peter.

684
00:53:15,452 --> 00:53:17,454
Listen, I'd love to believe
all of this, I really would.

685
00:53:17,833 --> 00:53:18,900
But you left...

686
00:53:19,158 --> 00:53:21,357
The most wonderful woman ever...

687
00:53:22,118 --> 00:53:23,377
...to die alone.

688
00:53:23,652 --> 00:53:26,632
I didn't want to leave
your mother, Peter.

689
00:53:27,047 --> 00:53:29,399
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...

690
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:31,043
...and the light within it...

691
00:53:31,317 --> 00:53:32,752
...this form will wither and perish.

692
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,729
Then why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?

693
00:53:35,059 --> 00:53:36,880
A criminal, of all people, to
come and to fetch me.

694
00:53:37,095 --> 00:53:38,996
I loved your mother, Peter!

695
00:53:39,471 --> 00:53:41,602
I couldn't stand to step
foot on an Earth...

696
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,923
...where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!

697
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,753
I know exactly what that feels like!

698
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:48,830
I had to watch her die!

699
00:53:53,955 --> 00:53:57,808
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...

700
00:53:58,216 --> 00:54:00,076
...I've made many mistakes, Peter.

701
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:03,009
But you're not one of them.

702
00:54:05,304 --> 00:54:08,564
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.

703
00:54:13,969 --> 00:54:18,295
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...

704
00:54:19,572 --> 00:54:20,542
...and the light within.

705
00:54:21,536 --> 00:54:23,775
They are a part of you, Peter.

706
00:54:25,494 --> 00:54:26,396
What do you mean?

707
00:54:28,127 --> 00:54:29,324
Give me your hand, son.

708
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,597
Here.

709
00:54:33,015 --> 00:54:34,346
Hold them like that.

710
00:54:37,606 --> 00:54:43,335
Now, close your eyes
and concentrate.

711
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:47,194
Take your brain to the
center of this planet.

712
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:54,066
Yes!
Yes!

713
00:54:54,418 --> 00:54:56,123
Whoa!

714
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:57,390
- Yes!
- What was it?

715
00:54:58,022 --> 00:54:59,505
It's okay, just relax.
Concentrate.

716
00:54:59,795 --> 00:55:00,639
You can do it.
Bring it back.

717
00:55:02,251 --> 00:55:02,979
Yes!

718
00:55:03,979 --> 00:55:07,047
Yes, now, shape it.

719
00:55:07,932 --> 00:55:08,744
Feel that energy.

720
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,496
Yes.

721
00:55:19,122 --> 00:55:19,866
You're home.

722
00:55:22,812 --> 00:55:23,561
Peter.

723
00:55:58,806 --> 00:56:01,401
How'd you get to this
weird, dumb planet?

724
00:56:02,395 --> 00:56:04,261
Ego found me in my larvae state.

725
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:06,464
Orphan on my homeworld.

726
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:10,359
He raised me by hand and
kept me as his own.

727
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:12,863
So, you're a pet.

728
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,059
I suppose.

729
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:18,909
People usually want cute pets.

730
00:56:19,651 --> 00:56:21,250
Why would Ego want such
a hideous one?

731
00:56:22,153 --> 00:56:22,908
I am hideous?

732
00:56:23,633 --> 00:56:25,291
You are horrifying to look at, yes.

733
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:30,988
- But that's a good thing.
- Oh?

734
00:56:31,615 --> 00:56:32,761
When you're ugly and
someone loves you...

735
00:56:33,158 --> 00:56:34,406
...you know they love
you for who you are.

736
00:56:37,189 --> 00:56:38,944
Beautiful people never
know who to trust.

737
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:42,244
Well, then I am certainly
grateful to be ugly.

738
00:56:44,907 --> 00:56:47,797
Those pools, they remind
me of a time...

739
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:51,197
...when I took my daughter to the
Forgotten Lakes of my homeworld.

740
00:56:52,891 --> 00:56:53,913
She was like you.

741
00:56:54,171 --> 00:56:55,366
Disgusting?

742
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:57,710
Innocent.

743
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,474
Drax?

744
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:35,463
There's something I
must tell you.

745
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:45,177
What's going on?

746
00:57:45,621 --> 00:57:47,021
This gross bug lady
is my new friend.

747
00:57:47,587 --> 00:57:50,347
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.

748
00:57:51,442 --> 00:57:52,207
You're not ugly.
Drax.

749
00:57:52,819 --> 00:57:53,955
What are you talking about?

750
00:57:54,445 --> 00:57:55,042
Mantis.

751
00:57:55,544 --> 00:57:57,194
Can you show us where
we'll be staying?

752
00:57:58,994 --> 00:58:00,387
Why are there no other
beings on this planet?

753
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:02,109
The planet is Ego.

754
00:58:02,966 --> 00:58:05,138
A dog would not invite a
flea to live on his back.

755
00:58:05,707 --> 00:58:06,717
And you're not a flea?

756
00:58:07,134 --> 00:58:08,416
I'm a flea with a purpose.

757
00:58:10,376 --> 00:58:11,313
I help him sleep.

758
00:58:12,085 --> 00:58:15,313
What were you about to say
to Drax before I walked out?

759
00:58:21,337 --> 00:58:22,137
Nothing.

760
00:58:23,362 --> 00:58:24,496
Your quarters are this way.

761
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:34,579
We deliver you to
the Kree in the morning.

762
00:58:38,722 --> 00:58:40,848
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.

763
00:58:42,497 --> 00:58:43,272
Okay, Taserface.

764
00:58:45,228 --> 00:58:46,610
Hey, tell the other guys, we said...

765
00:58:46,943 --> 00:58:47,973
Hi, Taserface!

766
00:58:53,402 --> 00:58:56,438
Oh! Hey, what about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?

767
00:58:56,802 --> 00:58:57,373
No, Gef.

768
00:58:58,236 --> 00:58:59,340
It's too adorable to kill.

769
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:00,999
Take it to the tailor.

770
00:59:03,703 --> 00:59:06,189
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.

771
00:59:09,228 --> 00:59:13,207
I was a Kree battle slave for
20 years when Stakar freed me.

772
00:59:16,385 --> 00:59:18,149
He offered me a place with the Ravagers.

773
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,404
He said, all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.

774
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:25,593
But I was young...

775
00:59:26,865 --> 00:59:29,247
...and greedy and stupid.

776
00:59:31,189 --> 00:59:33,011
Like you stealing those batteries.

777
00:59:33,559 --> 00:59:34,345
That was mostly Drax.

778
00:59:36,635 --> 00:59:38,976
Me & Stakar, and the other captains...

779
00:59:40,845 --> 00:59:42,850
...we won't so different from
you and your friends.

780
00:59:44,454 --> 00:59:45,567
The only family I ever had.

781
00:59:47,326 --> 00:59:48,693
When I broke the code...

782
00:59:51,565 --> 00:59:52,518
...they exiled me.

783
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:55,530
This is what I deserve.

784
00:59:56,275 --> 00:59:57,498
Slow down, drama queen.

785
00:59:58,167 --> 00:59:59,524
You might deserve
this, but I don't.

786
00:59:59,816 --> 01:00:00,539
We gotta get out of here.

787
01:00:03,049 --> 01:00:03,664
Where's Quill?

788
01:00:05,223 --> 01:00:06,104
Ah, he went off with his old man.

789
01:00:07,571 --> 01:00:08,770
- Ego?
- Yeah.

790
01:00:09,568 --> 01:00:11,029
It's a day for dumb-ass names.

791
01:00:14,704 --> 01:00:17,089
You smiled.  There for a second
I got a warm feeling.

792
01:00:17,444 --> 01:00:19,390
But then it was ruined by
those disgusting-ass teeth.

793
01:00:20,235 --> 01:00:22,024
You're like, a professional
asshole, or what?

794
01:00:22,336 --> 01:00:23,388
Pretty much a pro.

795
01:00:23,612 --> 01:00:25,642
Why didn't you deliver Quill
to Ego like you promised?

796
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:27,681
He was skinny.

797
01:00:29,021 --> 01:00:32,264
He fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thieving.

798
01:00:32,274 --> 01:00:34,141
Uh huh.

799
01:00:38,274 --> 01:00:40,141
I got an idea on how
to get out of here.

800
01:00:42,329 --> 01:00:44,277
But we're gonna need
your little friend.

801
01:00:45,791 --> 01:00:52,338
Mascot! Mascot!
Mascot! (repeating)

802
01:00:58,977 --> 01:01:01,354
You fellas all want
~sausage drunk?

803
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,415
Look how cute it is
when it's all riled up.

804
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:11,873
It's god-dang precious.

805
01:01:24,621 --> 01:01:28,120
Psst!  Hey, twig!

806
01:01:28,646 --> 01:01:29,527
Come here.

807
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:30,978
Come on.

808
01:01:38,115 --> 01:01:39,233
Aw man.

809
01:01:39,634 --> 01:01:40,859
What'd they do to you?

810
01:01:44,266 --> 01:01:45,604
Hey, you want to
help us get out of here?

811
01:01:47,281 --> 01:01:49,779
There's something I need you
to get and bring back to me.

812
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:54,592
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin.

813
01:01:55,196 --> 01:01:56,942
The thing I wore in my head.

814
01:01:57,283 --> 01:02:00,878
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.

815
01:02:01,453 --> 01:02:02,138
You got it?

816
01:02:34,267 --> 01:02:37,500
- Ugh.
- That's my underwear.

817
01:02:38,325 --> 01:02:39,717
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't
know what you were talking about.

818
01:02:40,359 --> 01:02:41,734
You have to explain
it more careful.

819
01:02:43,936 --> 01:02:46,923
It's a prototype fin.

820
01:02:52,886 --> 01:02:55,283
That's an Orloni.
It's a fin, Groot.

821
01:02:55,822 --> 01:02:57,211
You try it this time.

822
01:02:58,612 --> 01:02:59,200
All right.

823
01:03:00,904 --> 01:03:02,091
That's Vorker's eye.

824
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,644
He takes it out when he sleeps.

825
01:03:05,095 --> 01:03:06,011
Go, look again.

826
01:03:06,317 --> 01:03:07,625
But leave the eye here.

827
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:09,180
Why?

828
01:03:09,513 --> 01:03:10,675
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...

829
01:03:11,164 --> 01:03:12,518
and he's not gonna know...

830
01:03:12,937 --> 01:03:16,796
...where his eye is!
Ha ha ha ha!

831
01:03:22,266 --> 01:03:22,963
That's a desk.

832
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:25,368
We told you it was this big.

833
01:03:32,499 --> 01:03:34,505
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...

834
01:03:34,943 --> 01:03:36,368
...with a bunch of
severed human toes.

835
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:40,327
Okay, then let's just agree
to never discuss this.

836
01:03:44,673 --> 01:03:47,887
The drawer you want to open
has this symbol on it.

837
01:03:48,801 --> 01:03:49,368
Okay?

838
01:03:58,333 --> 01:03:59,443
What? No!

839
01:03:59,887 --> 01:04:01,410
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.

840
01:04:01,655 --> 01:04:02,652
That's not what I said!

841
01:04:02,985 --> 01:04:05,049
- I am Groot!
- He's relieved you don't want him to.

842
01:04:05,315 --> 01:04:06,453
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.

843
01:04:06,696 --> 01:04:07,514
I am Groot.

844
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:08,956
On anyone, not just himself.

845
01:04:09,206 --> 01:04:09,999
I am Groot.

846
01:04:10,234 --> 01:04:11,925
One minute, you think someone
has a weird shaped head...

847
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:14,112
...the next minute, just because,
you realize part of that head is the hat.

848
01:04:15,026 --> 01:04:15,969
That's why you don't like hats?

849
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,213
This is an important
conversation right now?

850
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:57,629
What you have there?

851
01:05:07,284 --> 01:05:08,783
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

852
01:05:11,979 --> 01:05:13,034
They killed all my friends.

853
01:05:17,651 --> 01:05:19,718
Get the third quadrant
ready for release.

854
01:05:27,276 --> 01:05:27,984
One more thing.

855
01:05:29,885 --> 01:05:31,866
You got any clones of
Quill's old music on the ship?

856
01:06:23,088 --> 01:06:23,854
He's got it!

857
01:06:24,177 --> 01:06:25,293
Yondu's got the fin!

858
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:26,285
Go!

859
01:07:08,448 --> 01:07:09,195
Down there!

860
01:09:07,789 --> 01:09:09,056
You maniac!

861
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:13,294
The whole ship's gonna blow.

862
01:09:23,303 --> 01:09:24,343
Not the whole ship.

863
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:42,659
Who is this?

864
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:46,123
I am sending you the
coordinates for Yondu's ship.

865
01:09:47,977 --> 01:09:49,410
- Release the quadrant!
- Aye, captain!

866
01:09:49,912 --> 01:09:51,994
I only ask one thing.

867
01:09:52,713 --> 01:09:54,397
That your High Priestess...

868
01:09:54,728 --> 01:09:58,072
...tell him the name of
the man what sealed his fate.

869
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,874
Taserface!

870
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:06,874
(snickers, then hearty laughing)

871
01:10:24,481 --> 01:10:25,347
Where to, captain?

872
01:10:25,731 --> 01:10:26,334
Ego.

873
01:10:28,718 --> 01:10:29,109
No, boy!

874
01:10:37,556 --> 01:10:42,040
It ain't healthy, mammalian body
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

875
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:43,162
I know that.

876
01:10:43,517 --> 01:10:45,145
We're about to do 700!

877
01:10:59,872 --> 01:11:01,601
So, I guess this could all
be mine someday.

878
01:11:03,097 --> 01:11:05,206
Rocket?
Rocket, are you there?

879
01:11:12,964 --> 01:11:13,806
What are you doing, Peter?

880
01:11:16,914 --> 01:11:17,834
Dance with me.

881
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,801
I'm not going to dance with you.

882
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:21,242
This is Sam Cooke...

883
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:24,307
...one of the greatest
Earth singers of all time.

884
01:11:54,766 --> 01:11:56,579
Drax says you're not a dancer.

885
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,218
If you ever tell anyone about this...

886
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:01,563
...I will kill you.

887
01:12:02,558 --> 01:12:05,643
When are we going to do something
about this unspoken thing between us?

888
01:12:07,267 --> 01:12:08,413
What unspoken thing?

889
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:11,049
This...

890
01:12:11,959 --> 01:12:13,781
...Cheers, Sam and Diane...

891
01:12:14,134 --> 01:12:17,339
...guy and a girl on a
TV show who dig each other...

892
01:12:17,613 --> 01:12:19,978
...but never say it because the
TV ratings would go down...

893
01:12:20,212 --> 01:12:21,229
...sort of thing.

894
01:12:21,469 --> 01:12:22,712
There's no unspoken thing here.

895
01:12:24,785 --> 01:12:27,910
Well, it's a catch-22, because if
you said it then it would be spoken...

896
01:12:28,161 --> 01:12:29,180
...and you'd be a liar.

897
01:12:29,421 --> 01:12:30,480
So, by not saying it...

898
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:34,430
...you are telling the truth
and admitting that there is.

899
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:36,711
No, that's not what I...

900
01:12:39,506 --> 01:12:43,185
What we should be discussing
right now is, something about this place.

901
01:12:44,084 --> 01:12:45,084
It doesn't feel right.

902
01:12:46,185 --> 01:12:47,157
What are you talking about?

903
01:12:48,633 --> 01:12:49,847
You're the one who
wanted me to come here.

904
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,302
That girl, Mantis...

905
01:12:51,553 --> 01:12:52,323
...she's afraid of something.

906
01:12:52,837 --> 01:12:54,220
Why are you trying to take
this away from me?

907
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,864
I'm not trying...

908
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:58,215
He's my father.
He's blood.

909
01:12:58,434 --> 01:12:59,950
Well you have blood on Earth,
you never wanted to return there.

910
01:13:00,138 --> 01:13:01,419
Again, you made me come here.

911
01:13:01,765 --> 01:13:03,909
And Earth, Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.

912
01:13:04,103 --> 01:13:07,405
No, it's because that place is
real, and this is a fantasy.

913
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:09,877
This is real!
I'm only half human, remember?

914
01:13:10,222 --> 01:13:11,474
That's the half I'm worried about.

915
01:13:11,745 --> 01:13:13,477
Oh, so...I get it.
You're jealous...

916
01:13:13,762 --> 01:13:16,628
...because I'm part god and
you like when I'm the weak one.

917
01:13:16,878 --> 01:13:18,849
You were insufferable to begin with.

918
01:13:19,445 --> 01:13:20,673
I haven't been able
to reach Rocket.

919
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:22,182
I'm going to go outside and
try to get a signal.

920
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,530
You know what?
This is not Cheers after all.

921
01:13:24,969 --> 01:13:28,048
This is whatever the show is where
one person is willing to...

922
01:13:28,273 --> 01:13:31,584
...open themselves up to to new
possibilities, and the other person...

923
01:13:31,976 --> 01:13:33,273
...is a jerk who
doesn't trust anybody!

924
01:13:33,577 --> 01:13:34,994
It's a show that doesn't exist!

925
01:13:35,391 --> 01:13:36,896
That's why it would get zero ratings.

926
01:13:37,757 --> 01:13:39,715
I don't know what Cheers is.

927
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:42,507
I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?

928
01:13:44,277 --> 01:13:45,628
I thought you alread had.

929
01:14:49,453 --> 01:14:50,484
Psychopath!

930
01:17:00,723 --> 01:17:01,881
Are you kidding me!

931
01:17:29,614 --> 01:17:30,491
I win.

932
01:17:30,824 --> 01:17:32,417
I win, I bested you in combat.

933
01:17:32,889 --> 01:17:34,600
No.
I saved your life.

934
01:17:35,004 --> 01:17:36,559
Well you were stupid
enough to let me live.

935
01:17:37,034 --> 01:17:38,090
You let me live!

936
01:17:38,444 --> 01:17:39,806
I don't need you to
always try and defeat me!

937
01:17:40,058 --> 01:17:42,922
I'm not the one who just flew across the
universe just because I wanted to win.

938
01:17:43,173 --> 01:17:44,583
Do not tell me what I want.

939
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,099
I don't need to tell
you what you want!

940
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:47,010
It's obvious!

941
01:17:47,244 --> 01:17:49,547
You were the one who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!

942
01:17:58,443 --> 01:17:59,443
You were all I had.

943
01:18:01,448 --> 01:18:02,711
But you were the one
who needed to win.

944
01:18:05,192 --> 01:18:06,555
Thanos pulled my eye
from my head...

945
01:18:08,146 --> 01:18:09,352
...and my brain from my skull...

946
01:18:11,293 --> 01:18:12,474
...and my arm from my body...

947
01:18:14,918 --> 01:18:15,800
...because of you.

948
01:18:25,533 --> 01:18:29,720
<i>AWESOME MIX VOL. 2</i>

949
01:18:38,123 --> 01:18:38,943
You all right, son?

950
01:18:41,296 --> 01:18:44,851
I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier in quite a huff.

951
01:18:45,663 --> 01:18:46,213
Yeah.

952
01:18:47,145 --> 01:18:48,625
It's fortuitous,...

953
01:18:48,936 --> 01:18:50,220
...you listening to this song.

954
01:18:50,644 --> 01:18:51,789
You know, uh, "Brandy?"

955
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:53,406
By Looking Glass?

956
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:56,541
A favorite of your mom's.

957
01:18:57,656 --> 01:18:58,531
Yes.  Yeah, it was.

958
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:01,338
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.

959
01:19:01,647 --> 01:19:03,042
Perhaps its very greatest.

960
01:19:03,437 --> 01:19:04,056
Yeah, yes!

961
01:19:04,402 --> 01:19:07,966
You know, Peter, you and I, we're...
we're the sailer in that song.

962
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:15,367
He came on a summer's day.
Bringing gifts from far away.

963
01:19:15,845 --> 01:19:19,367
Like the child I put
in your mother.

964
01:19:19,673 --> 01:19:21,600
Or the freedom you brought Gamora.

965
01:19:22,001 --> 01:19:26,664
Brandy, you're a fine girl.

966
01:19:27,001 --> 01:19:30,664
What a good wife you would be.

967
01:19:31,001 --> 01:19:35,664
My life, my love,
my lady, is the sea.

968
01:19:36,996 --> 01:19:38,400
The sea calls the sailor back.

969
01:19:38,996 --> 01:19:41,400
And he loves the girl, but
that's not his place.

970
01:19:42,143 --> 01:19:46,160
The sea calls upon him as
history calls upon great men.

971
01:19:47,356 --> 01:19:50,556
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.

972
01:19:51,485 --> 01:19:53,731
Well, you may not be
mortal, but me...

973
01:19:54,048 --> 01:19:54,788
No, Peter.

974
01:19:55,062 --> 01:19:56,881
Death will remain a
stranger to both of us...

975
01:19:57,466 --> 01:19:59,416
...as long as the light
burns in this planet.

976
01:20:00,634 --> 01:20:03,549
- I'm immortal?
- Mm-hm.

977
01:20:03,944 --> 01:20:04,726
Really?

978
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,465
Yes!
As long as this light exists.

979
01:20:08,989 --> 01:20:12,058
And I can use the light to
build cool things, like...

980
01:20:12,401 --> 01:20:13,988
...how you made this whole planet?

981
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,471
Well, it may take you a few
million years of practice...

982
01:20:16,885 --> 01:20:18,283
...before you get
really good at it.

983
01:20:18,572 --> 01:20:19,405
But, yes!

984
01:20:19,616 --> 01:20:20,147
What?

985
01:20:20,539 --> 01:20:24,682
This is...!  Well, get ready for
an 800-foot statue of Pac-Man...

986
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:25,654
...with Skeletor and Heather Locklear.

987
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:26,823
Whatever you want.

988
01:20:27,124 --> 01:20:28,253
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

989
01:20:28,597 --> 01:20:30,892
You know, Peter, it is
a tremendous responsibility.

990
01:20:31,552 --> 01:20:33,852
Only we can remake the universe.

991
01:20:34,714 --> 01:20:37,324
Only we can take the
bridle of the cosmos...

992
01:20:37,785 --> 01:20:39,257
...and lead it to
where it needs to go.

993
01:20:40,973 --> 01:20:41,665
How?

994
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:53,692
Come with me.

995
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:05,832
Drax. Drax.

996
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:07,606
Drax! Drax!
We need to talk.

997
01:21:10,154 --> 01:21:11,039
I'm sorry.

998
01:21:12,045 --> 01:21:13,641
But I like a woman with
some meat on her bones.

999
01:21:14,032 --> 01:21:14,566
What?

1000
01:21:14,856 --> 01:21:18,617
I tried to let you down easily by
telling you I found you disgusting.

1001
01:21:18,931 --> 01:21:20,101
No, that's not why...

1002
01:21:23,976 --> 01:21:24,535
What are you doing?

1003
01:21:25,537 --> 01:21:28,377
I'm imagining being with you.

1004
01:21:28,638 --> 01:21:29,231
Drax, that's not...

1005
01:21:29,499 --> 01:21:31,144
I don't like you like that.

1006
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:33,575
I don't even know the
type of thing you are.

1007
01:21:33,969 --> 01:21:35,828
Hey!
There's no need to get personal.

1008
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:38,938
Listen!
Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.

1009
01:21:39,491 --> 01:21:40,624
I should have told you earlier.

1010
01:21:40,999 --> 01:21:43,692
I is stupid.
You are in danger.

1011
01:21:50,432 --> 01:21:51,022
What is that?

1012
01:21:54,427 --> 01:21:58,551
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.

1013
01:21:58,862 --> 01:22:01,490
Everything around us,
including the girl...

1014
01:22:01,811 --> 01:22:04,434
...everything is temporary.

1015
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:08,200
We are forever.

1016
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,691
Doesn't eternity get boring?

1017
01:22:09,969 --> 01:22:11,209
Not if you have a purpose, Peter.

1018
01:22:11,819 --> 01:22:13,632
Which is why you're here.

1019
01:22:14,476 --> 01:22:16,666
I told you how all those years ago...

1020
01:22:16,954 --> 01:22:20,933
...I had an unceasing
impulse to find life.

1021
01:22:21,352 --> 01:22:24,875
But what I did not tell you
is how I finally did find it.

1022
01:22:26,037 --> 01:22:27,769
It was all so...

1023
01:22:29,719 --> 01:22:30,898
...disappointing.

1024
01:22:31,983 --> 01:22:34,165
And that is when I came...

1025
01:22:35,498 --> 01:22:39,048
...to a profound realization.

1026
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:44,424
My innate desire to
seek out other life...

1027
01:22:44,833 --> 01:22:49,385
...was not so that I
could walk among that life.

1028
01:22:51,719 --> 01:22:52,570
Peter.

1029
01:22:53,882 --> 01:22:57,590
I have found meaning.

1030
01:23:16,225 --> 01:23:17,561
I see it.

1031
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:21,754
Eternity.

1032
01:23:23,462 --> 01:23:24,237
Oh my god.

1033
01:23:35,018 --> 01:23:36,298
We need to get off this planet.

1034
01:23:51,013 --> 01:23:51,856
Oh man.

1035
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:53,930
Anyway, before I was so
rudely interrupted.

1036
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:57,005
At that time, I was
a Federal Express man.

1037
01:24:08,577 --> 01:24:10,226
What the hell you doing, boy?

1038
01:24:10,868 --> 01:24:12,463
I could tell by how
you talked about him...

1039
01:24:12,733 --> 01:24:14,031
...this Ego is bad news.

1040
01:24:14,386 --> 01:24:15,784
We are here to save Quill.

1041
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:20,381
For what?  Huh?
For honor? For love?

1042
01:24:20,682 --> 01:24:22,223
No.
I don't care about those things.

1043
01:24:22,825 --> 01:24:25,249
I want to save Quill so I
can prove I'm better than him!

1044
01:24:25,747 --> 01:24:28,455
I can lord this
over him forever.

1045
01:24:30,793 --> 01:24:31,817
What are you laughing
at me for?

1046
01:24:32,223 --> 01:24:36,980
Oh, you can fool yourself and
everyone else, but you can't fool me.

1047
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:39,169
I know who you are.

1048
01:24:39,505 --> 01:24:41,250
You do not know anything
about me, loser.

1049
01:24:41,898 --> 01:24:43,401
I know everything about you.

1050
01:24:43,931 --> 01:24:46,785
I know you play like your the
meanest and the hardest...

1051
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:48,679
...but actually you're the
most scared of all.

1052
01:24:49,004 --> 01:24:49,639
Shut up!

1053
01:24:50,124 --> 01:24:51,582
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...

1054
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:54,151
...and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...

1055
01:24:54,561 --> 01:24:55,760
Because just a little bit of love...

1056
01:24:56,213 --> 01:25:00,026
...reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.

1057
01:25:00,256 --> 01:25:00,939
I said, shut up!

1058
01:25:01,245 --> 01:25:04,334
I know them scientists what made
you never gave a rat's ass about you.

1059
01:25:04,807 --> 01:25:05,514
I'm serious, dude.

1060
01:25:05,866 --> 01:25:09,514
Just like my own damn parents,
who sold me,...

1061
01:25:09,561 --> 01:25:11,200
... their own little
baby, into slavery.

1062
01:25:11,759 --> 01:25:13,517
I know who you are, boy.

1063
01:25:14,105 --> 01:25:15,295
Because you're me.

1064
01:25:22,863 --> 01:25:24,341
What kind of a pair are we

1065
01:25:26,283 --> 01:25:28,449
The kinds that's about to
go fight a planet, I recon.

1066
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:31,301
All right!
Okay.

1067
01:25:31,721 --> 01:25:32,376
Wait.

1068
01:25:32,688 --> 01:25:33,492
Fight a what?

1069
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:39,197
Who are you people?

1070
01:25:39,656 --> 01:25:40,312
What is this place?

1071
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:41,321
Gamora, let her go!

1072
01:25:41,801 --> 01:25:43,732
The bodies in the
caverns, who are they?

1073
01:25:45,026 --> 01:25:45,883
You are scared.

1074
01:25:49,967 --> 01:25:52,435
I call it, the Expansion.

1075
01:25:54,163 --> 01:25:55,761
It is my purpose.

1076
01:25:56,177 --> 01:26:00,736
Now, it is yours, as well.

1077
01:26:02,163 --> 01:26:03,246
It's beautiful.

1078
01:26:04,779 --> 01:26:06,160
Over thousands of years...

1079
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:09,233
...I implanted thousands
of extension of myself...

1080
01:26:10,092 --> 01:26:12,151
...on thousands of worlds.

1081
01:26:13,217 --> 01:26:16,927
I need to fulfill life's
one true purpose...

1082
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,028
...to grow and spread...

1083
01:26:19,364 --> 01:26:21,957
...covering all that exists...

1084
01:26:22,472 --> 01:26:26,863
...until everything is...

1085
01:26:28,074 --> 01:26:29,415
...me.

1086
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:30,781
What did she do to me?

1087
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:33,553
She already told me everything.

1088
01:26:34,023 --> 01:26:35,794
I only had one problem.

1089
01:26:37,357 --> 01:26:41,366
A single Celestial doesn't have
enough power for such an enterprise.

1090
01:26:42,775 --> 01:26:44,849
But two Celestials...

1091
01:26:45,181 --> 01:26:48,722
...well, now, that just might do.

1092
01:26:51,084 --> 01:26:52,047
The bodies...

1093
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:54,081
...are his children.

1094
01:26:55,899 --> 01:26:57,381
Out of all my labors...

1095
01:26:57,660 --> 01:26:59,416
...the most beguiling
was attempting to...

1096
01:26:59,735 --> 01:27:02,145
...graft my DNA with
that of another species.

1097
01:27:02,844 --> 01:27:05,975
I hoped the result of such
a coupling would be...

1098
01:27:06,268 --> 01:27:07,743
...enough to power the Expansion.

1099
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:11,475
I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.

1100
01:27:11,752 --> 01:27:16,224
It broke the Ravager code, but
I compensated him generously, and...

1101
01:27:16,681 --> 01:27:18,880
...to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.

1102
01:27:19,272 --> 01:27:21,652
And that was true,
they never felt a thing.

1103
01:27:21,963 --> 01:27:24,069
But, one after the
other, they failed me.

1104
01:27:25,295 --> 01:27:28,530
Not one of them
carried the Celestial genes.

1105
01:27:29,435 --> 01:27:30,332
Until you, Peter.

1106
01:27:31,925 --> 01:27:33,761
Out of all my spawn...

1107
01:27:34,502 --> 01:27:37,939
...only you carry the
connection to the light.

1108
01:27:39,021 --> 01:27:41,936
We need to find Peter now
and get off this damn planet.

1109
01:27:42,141 --> 01:27:43,816
Ego will have brought
him to his side by now.

1110
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:46,329
- He has a way.
- Then we just go.
- No!

1111
01:27:46,904 --> 01:27:48,928
- He's our friend.
- All any of you do...

1112
01:27:49,165 --> 01:27:50,275
...is yell at each other.

1113
01:27:50,882 --> 01:27:51,668
You're not friends.

1114
01:27:51,977 --> 01:27:52,726
You're right.

1115
01:27:53,983 --> 01:27:54,854
We're family.

1116
01:27:56,618 --> 01:27:58,012
We leave noone behind.

1117
01:28:01,812 --> 01:28:02,631
Except maybe you.

1118
01:28:03,959 --> 01:28:04,815
Thank you.

1119
01:28:05,618 --> 01:28:07,476
For the first time
in my existence...

1120
01:28:08,207 --> 01:28:10,213
...I am truly not alone!

1121
01:28:16,734 --> 01:28:17,637
What is it, son?

1122
01:28:21,239 --> 01:28:21,923
My friends.

1123
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:27,137
Oh, no, you see,
that's the mortal in you, Peter.

1124
01:28:27,625 --> 01:28:28,589
Yes.

1125
01:28:29,341 --> 01:28:32,118
We are beyond such things.

1126
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:33,149
Yes.

1127
01:28:35,988 --> 01:28:37,024
- Now...
- But my mother...

1128
01:28:40,038 --> 01:28:42,053
You said you loved my mother.

1129
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:43,558
And that I did.

1130
01:28:45,327 --> 01:28:49,808
My River Lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.

1131
01:28:51,936 --> 01:28:54,040
I returned to Earth to
see her three times.

1132
01:28:54,803 --> 01:28:57,104
And I knew if returned a 4th...

1133
01:28:57,628 --> 01:28:58,601
...I'd never leave.

1134
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:01,461
The Expansion...

1135
01:29:03,312 --> 01:29:05,399
...the reason for my very
existence would be over, so...

1136
01:29:05,721 --> 01:29:07,576
...I did what I had to do.

1137
01:29:08,074 --> 01:29:13,545
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.

1138
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:19,009
What?

1139
01:29:20,213 --> 01:29:21,075
Now, now, I know...

1140
01:29:21,453 --> 01:29:22,733
...that sounds bad.

1141
01:29:34,799 --> 01:29:37,828
Who in the hell
do you think you are?

1142
01:29:38,366 --> 01:29:40,088
You killed my mother!

1143
01:29:40,381 --> 01:29:41,428
I tried...

1144
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:42,804
...so hard...

1145
01:29:43,622 --> 01:29:44,740
...to find the form...

1146
01:29:45,038 --> 01:29:46,597
...that best suited you...

1147
01:29:47,051 --> 01:29:49,791
...and this is
the thanks I get?

1148
01:29:50,783 --> 01:29:52,949
You really need to grow up.

1149
01:29:58,308 --> 01:29:59,433
I wanted to do this together.

1150
01:30:00,118 --> 01:30:03,993
But I suppose you'll have to learn by
spending the next thousand years...

1151
01:30:04,118 --> 01:30:05,993
...as a battery.

1152
01:30:07,913 --> 01:30:09,215
(beeps)
Finally!  Rocket?

1153
01:30:09,736 --> 01:30:12,144
Keep that transmitter
nearby so I can find you.

1154
01:30:12,422 --> 01:30:15,618
We're in an old piece of construction
Wip and Yondu once used...

1155
01:30:15,991 --> 01:30:17,176
...to slice open the bank of A'askavaria.

1156
01:30:17,492 --> 01:30:18,253
Ego's unhinged.

1157
01:30:18,645 --> 01:30:19,480
I know.
Get ready.

1158
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:20,813
Cut him loose, Kraglin.

1159
01:30:39,937 --> 01:30:40,702
No.

1160
01:30:51,547 --> 01:30:56,281
My life, my love,
my lady, is the sea.

1161
01:30:59,547 --> 01:31:00,281
Peter.

1162
01:31:01,586 --> 01:31:03,344
This is the sea.

1163
01:31:46,802 --> 01:31:47,990
Hey there, jackass!

1164
01:31:58,884 --> 01:32:00,380
- What is that?
- Whoa, it's ~?

1165
01:32:07,978 --> 01:32:09,503
Out of the way,
dumber, smaller Groot!

1166
01:32:14,798 --> 01:32:16,658
I told you something
didn't feel right.

1167
01:32:17,575 --> 01:32:19,409
"I told you so?"
Just what I need to hear right now.

1168
01:32:19,766 --> 01:32:20,819
Well, I came back, didn't I?

1169
01:32:22,378 --> 01:32:23,581
Because of the unspoken thing.

1170
01:32:23,819 --> 01:32:25,451
There is no unspoken thing.

1171
01:32:25,811 --> 01:32:27,289
What are you doing?
You could have killed us all.

1172
01:32:27,784 --> 01:32:29,445
Uh, "Thank you, Rocket?"

1173
01:32:29,853 --> 01:32:30,844
We had it under control.

1174
01:32:31,134 --> 01:32:33,252
We did not.
That is only an extension of...

1175
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:34,598
...his true self.

1176
01:32:35,111 --> 01:32:36,016
He will be back soon.

1177
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:37,115
What's Smurfette doing here?

1178
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,320
Whatever I need to do
to get a damn ride home.

1179
01:32:39,570 --> 01:32:40,554
She tried to murder me!

1180
01:32:40,844 --> 01:32:42,216
I saved you, you stupid fox!

1181
01:32:42,518 --> 01:32:43,665
He's not a fox.

1182
01:32:43,994 --> 01:32:45,508
- I am Groot.
- I'm not a rabboon either.

1183
01:32:45,945 --> 01:32:47,027
I am Groot.

1184
01:32:47,334 --> 01:32:49,017
Raccoon.
Whatever.

1185
01:32:52,948 --> 01:32:54,008
How do we kill a Celestial?

1186
01:32:54,330 --> 01:32:55,505
There's a center to him.

1187
01:32:55,833 --> 01:32:59,380
His brain, his soul, whatever it is,
in some sort of protective shell.

1188
01:32:59,727 --> 01:33:00,579
It's in the caverns...

1189
01:33:00,791 --> 01:33:01,874
...below the surface.

1190
01:33:04,725 --> 01:33:05,201
Yondu?

1191
01:33:14,859 --> 01:33:15,913
Thrusters are out.

1192
01:33:16,164 --> 01:33:18,209
I guess I should be
glad I was a skinny kid.

1193
01:33:18,465 --> 01:33:20,169
Otherwise you would've
delivered me to this maniac.

1194
01:33:20,507 --> 01:33:22,705
You still recon that's the
reason I kept you around, idiot?

1195
01:33:22,914 --> 01:33:24,785
That's what you
told me, you old doofus.

1196
01:33:25,161 --> 01:33:26,999
Well once I figured out what
happened to them other kids...

1197
01:33:27,294 --> 01:33:28,530
...I wasn't just
gonna hand you over.

1198
01:33:29,053 --> 01:33:30,471
You said you were
gonna eat me.

1199
01:33:30,912 --> 01:33:32,162
That was being funny.

1200
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,220
Not to me!

1201
01:33:34,521 --> 01:33:35,704
You people have issues.

1202
01:33:35,972 --> 01:33:37,133
Well of course I have issues.

1203
01:33:37,536 --> 01:33:39,959
That's my freaking father!

1204
01:33:41,287 --> 01:33:42,258
Thrusters are back up.

1205
01:33:56,359 --> 01:33:58,367
- We should be going up!
- We can't.

1206
01:33:59,042 --> 01:34:01,401
Ego wants to eradicate the
universe as we know it.

1207
01:34:01,876 --> 01:34:02,654
We have to kill him.

1208
01:34:03,231 --> 01:34:03,789
Rocket!

1209
01:34:04,163 --> 01:34:04,667
Got it!

1210
01:34:19,154 --> 01:34:20,383
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

1211
01:34:20,778 --> 01:34:21,497
I guess.

1212
01:34:21,896 --> 01:34:22,815
Awesome!

1213
01:34:25,832 --> 01:34:27,366
We're really gonna be
able to jack up our price...

1214
01:34:27,629 --> 01:34:29,165
...if we're two-time galaxy savers.

1215
01:34:29,551 --> 01:34:31,896
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.

1216
01:34:32,135 --> 01:34:34,593
It was just a random thought,
man.  I thought we were friends?

1217
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:37,076
Of course, I care about
the planets and the buildings...

1218
01:34:37,382 --> 01:34:38,792
...and all the animals
on the planets.

1219
01:34:39,138 --> 01:34:40,264
And the people.

1220
01:34:40,969 --> 01:34:41,535
Meh.

1221
01:34:41,901 --> 01:34:45,388
The crabby puppy's so cute.
He makes me want to die!

1222
01:34:59,783 --> 01:35:01,147
Soup! Soup!

1223
01:35:23,783 --> 01:35:25,147
Pilots...

1224
01:35:25,447 --> 01:35:26,547
...release envoy units.

1225
01:35:29,112 --> 01:35:32,122
Our sensors detect a battery
below the surface of the planet.

1226
01:35:35,006 --> 01:35:35,558
Dive!

1227
01:35:53,786 --> 01:35:54,408
Um. Cap'n?

1228
01:35:55,117 --> 01:35:55,740
(muffled) Cap'n?

1229
01:36:01,521 --> 01:36:03,186
Tell me, why'd Ego
want you here?

1230
01:36:03,641 --> 01:36:05,549
He needs my genetic
connection to the light...

1231
01:36:05,786 --> 01:36:07,170
...to help destroy the universe.

1232
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:09,056
He tried to teach me how
to control the power.

1233
01:36:10,355 --> 01:36:11,010
So, could you?

1234
01:36:11,255 --> 01:36:12,111
A little.

1235
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:13,681
I made a ball.

1236
01:36:14,152 --> 01:36:14,833
A ball?

1237
01:36:15,474 --> 01:36:18,574
I thought as hard as I could.
That's all that I could come up with.

1238
01:36:18,778 --> 01:36:19,495
You thought?

1239
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:22,519
You think when I let
this arrow fly...

1240
01:36:22,829 --> 01:36:24,057
...I use my head?

1241
01:36:36,049 --> 01:36:36,898
Woah.

1242
01:36:46,369 --> 01:36:47,027
There.

1243
01:36:47,477 --> 01:36:48,464
That's Ego's core.

1244
01:36:51,713 --> 01:36:53,148
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1245
01:36:53,614 --> 01:36:54,490
I got it covered.

1246
01:37:01,532 --> 01:37:02,212
We must hurry.

1247
01:37:02,768 --> 01:37:04,752
It will not take Ego
long to find us.

1248
01:37:09,468 --> 01:37:10,123
Keep it steady.

1249
01:37:17,136 --> 01:37:18,681
We drill into the
center, we kill him!

1250
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,499
Captain?

1251
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:27,838
What is it, Kraglin?

1252
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:30,435
Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?

1253
01:37:30,878 --> 01:37:31,544
Yeah, why?

1254
01:37:32,078 --> 01:37:33,544
- Uhh...
- Oh hell!

1255
01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:56,457
Why aren't you firing the laser?

1256
01:37:56,906 --> 01:37:58,066
They blew up the generator.

1257
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,586
I think I packed
a small detonator.

1258
01:38:00,873 --> 01:38:02,769
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.

1259
01:38:03,235 --> 01:38:04,183
Well, we've got these.

1260
01:38:05,695 --> 01:38:07,105
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

1261
01:38:07,361 --> 01:38:09,845
If it is, it'll
cause a chain reaction...

1262
01:38:10,165 --> 01:38:11,469
...throughout his
entire nervous system.

1263
01:38:11,715 --> 01:38:12,359
Meaning what?

1264
01:38:12,553 --> 01:38:13,927
Meaning the entire planet will explode.

1265
01:38:14,228 --> 01:38:15,796
We'll have to get out of here fast.

1266
01:38:16,045 --> 01:38:17,431
I made the timer.

1267
01:38:18,739 --> 01:38:19,013
Go!

1268
01:38:33,845 --> 01:38:34,952
He's coming!

1269
01:38:37,342 --> 01:38:38,515
Didn't you say you
could make him sleep?

1270
01:38:39,222 --> 01:38:41,097
When he wants.
He's too powerful.

1271
01:38:41,779 --> 01:38:42,536
I can't!

1272
01:38:43,694 --> 01:38:44,923
You have to believe in yourself.

1273
01:38:45,826 --> 01:38:47,703
Because I believe in you.

1274
01:39:00,729 --> 01:39:01,349
Sleep!

1275
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:10,113
I never thought she'd
be able to do it...

1276
01:39:10,575 --> 01:39:12,011
...with as weak and
skinny as she appears to be.

1277
01:39:13,887 --> 01:39:15,781
I don't know how
long I can hold him.

1278
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:21,154
The metal's too thick.

1279
01:39:21,608 --> 01:39:22,587
For the bomb to work,...

1280
01:39:22,845 --> 01:39:24,545
...we actually need
to place it on Ego's core.

1281
01:39:25,192 --> 01:39:27,938
And our fat butts ain't
gonna fit through those tiny holes.

1282
01:39:28,533 --> 01:39:29,744
Well...

1283
01:39:32,122 --> 01:39:33,383
That's a terrible idea.

1284
01:39:33,896 --> 01:39:35,594
Which is the only kind
of idea we have left.

1285
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:38,250
Unbelievable.

1286
01:39:39,182 --> 01:39:41,154
Rocket, do this.
Rocket, do that.

1287
01:39:43,109 --> 01:39:43,772
What a day.

1288
01:39:51,948 --> 01:39:55,080
All right, first you flick
this switch, then this switch.

1289
01:39:55,458 --> 01:39:56,477
That activates it.

1290
01:39:57,001 --> 01:39:59,075
Then you push this button.

1291
01:39:59,284 --> 01:40:01,225
Which will give you 5 minutes
to get out of there.

1292
01:40:01,638 --> 01:40:03,693
Now, whatever you do...

1293
01:40:04,129 --> 01:40:06,132
...don't push this button.

1294
01:40:06,799 --> 01:40:09,818
'Cause that will set off the bomb
immediately and we'll all be dead.

1295
01:40:10,278 --> 01:40:12,300
Now, repeat back what I just said.

1296
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:14,240
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

1297
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:16,412
- I am Groot.
- That's right.

1298
01:40:16,871 --> 01:40:17,787
- I am Groot.
- No!

1299
01:40:18,403 --> 01:40:20,409
No, that's the button that
will kill everyone!

1300
01:40:20,879 --> 01:40:21,995
Try again.

1301
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:26,686
- I am Groot.
- Um-hmm.

1302
01:40:26,975 --> 01:40:27,972
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.

1303
01:40:29,769 --> 01:40:30,358
- I am Groot.
- No!

1304
01:40:30,767 --> 01:40:33,722
That's exactly what you just
said, how is that even possible?

1305
01:40:34,068 --> 01:40:35,884
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?

1306
01:40:36,204 --> 01:40:36,841
Point to it.

1307
01:40:37,671 --> 01:40:38,635
No!

1308
01:40:38,990 --> 01:40:40,344
Hey, you're making him nervous!

1309
01:40:40,763 --> 01:40:42,431
Shut up and
give me some tape!

1310
01:40:42,769 --> 01:40:44,088
Does anybody have
any tape out there?

1311
01:40:44,631 --> 01:40:45,982
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.

1312
01:40:46,275 --> 01:40:48,235
I don't have any tape.
Let me check.

1313
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:50,456
Yo, Yondu...

1314
01:40:52,176 --> 01:40:53,440
...do you have any...ouch!
Do you have any tape?

1315
01:40:56,947 --> 01:40:58,824
Gamora?
You have the tape?

1316
01:41:00,048 --> 01:41:00,578
Tape!

1317
01:41:01,195 --> 01:41:01,906
Ah, nevermind.

1318
01:41:04,602 --> 01:41:06,361
Drax?
Do you have any tape?

1319
01:41:07,865 --> 01:41:09,210
Yeah, Scotch tape would work.

1320
01:41:10,088 --> 01:41:12,170
Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work
if you don't have any?

1321
01:41:14,807 --> 01:41:15,795
Nobody has any tape!

1322
01:41:16,012 --> 01:41:17,750
Not a single person has tape?

1323
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:19,093
Nope.

1324
01:41:19,369 --> 01:41:20,195
Did you ask Nebula?

1325
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:21,660
Yes!

1326
01:41:21,992 --> 01:41:22,957
Are you sure?

1327
01:41:23,271 --> 01:41:24,409
I asked Yondu...

1328
01:41:24,675 --> 01:41:25,717
...and she was
sitting right next to him.

1329
01:41:25,964 --> 01:41:26,939
I knew you're lying!

1330
01:41:27,189 --> 01:41:28,986
You have priceless batteries and
an atomic bomb in your bag.

1331
01:41:29,251 --> 01:41:31,122
If anybody's gonna
have tape, it's you!

1332
01:41:31,645 --> 01:41:35,658
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!

1333
01:41:35,885 --> 01:41:37,359
You are wasting
a lot of time here!

1334
01:41:44,505 --> 01:41:45,383
We're all gonna die.

1335
01:41:48,199 --> 01:41:49,895
Ah, rear thrusters are out again!

1336
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:52,330
We're done for
without that generator!

1337
01:42:06,693 --> 01:42:07,400
Guardians.

1338
01:42:08,553 --> 01:42:10,517
Perhaps it will
provide you solace...

1339
01:42:10,735 --> 01:42:12,575
...that your deaths
are not without purpose.

1340
01:42:13,064 --> 01:42:15,064
They will serve as a warning...

1341
01:42:15,276 --> 01:42:17,145
...for all of those
tempted to betray us.

1342
01:42:18,265 --> 01:42:20,316
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

1343
01:42:24,902 --> 01:42:25,820
This is gonna hurt.

1344
01:42:26,158 --> 01:42:26,928
Promises, promises.

1345
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:50,975
No!

1346
01:42:52,058 --> 01:42:55,057
No! No! No!

1347
01:42:59,635 --> 01:43:00,453
We're gonna blow!

1348
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:07,959
Peter!
No!

1349
01:43:27,914 --> 01:43:28,608
- Ha ha!
- What?

1350
01:43:29,236 --> 01:43:30,556
You look like Mary Poppins.

1351
01:43:31,308 --> 01:43:32,090
Is he cool?

1352
01:43:34,623 --> 01:43:35,501
Hell yeah, he's cool.

1353
01:43:36,949 --> 01:43:38,438
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1354
01:44:06,190 --> 01:44:07,486
Mantis!
Look out!

1355
01:44:20,328 --> 01:44:21,133
She's just unconscious.

1356
01:44:38,088 --> 01:44:39,121
How long 'til the
bomb goes off?

1357
01:44:39,444 --> 01:44:41,688
In the unlikely event
that Groot doesn't kill us all...

1358
01:44:42,100 --> 01:44:43,149
...about 6 minutes.

1359
01:44:47,639 --> 01:44:49,631
Kraglin, we need the
quadrant for an extraction.

1360
01:44:49,967 --> 01:44:50,949
T-minus 5 minutes.

1361
01:44:51,135 --> 01:44:51,773
Aye, captain.

1362
01:44:56,349 --> 01:44:58,108
Somebody's gotta be on
top when Kraglin arrives.

1363
01:44:59,563 --> 01:45:00,592
Drax, take Mantis.

1364
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:05,644
Ow! My nipples!

1365
01:45:05,963 --> 01:45:07,644
Ahhh!

1366
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:14,383
Gamora!

1367
01:45:18,614 --> 01:45:19,352
Peter!

1368
01:45:45,709 --> 01:45:46,639
Get over it.

1369
01:45:47,515 --> 01:45:50,465
Come now, Peter.
I know this isn't what you want.

1370
01:45:53,447 --> 01:45:57,195
What kind of father would I be
to let you make this choice?

1371
01:46:27,602 --> 01:46:28,246
Yeah!

1372
01:46:29,599 --> 01:46:32,829
Soon, Peter,
we will be all there is.

1373
01:46:33,641 --> 01:46:36,690
So stop pissing me off!

1374
01:46:57,041 --> 01:46:58,602
We have to get up
to the extraction point.

1375
01:47:06,734 --> 01:47:07,360
Go!

1376
01:49:07,141 --> 01:49:08,416
I told you...

1377
01:49:08,711 --> 01:49:11,623
...I don't want
to do this alone.

1378
01:49:16,019 --> 01:49:17,521
You can not deny...

1379
01:49:17,888 --> 01:49:20,811
...the purpose the
universe has bestowed upon you.

1380
01:49:30,486 --> 01:49:32,149
Everyone, I need you
to stay back, it's not safe...

1381
01:49:32,534 --> 01:49:33,457
What is that?

1382
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:50,980
It doesn't need to
be like this, Peter.

1383
01:49:53,081 --> 01:49:55,476
Why are you destroying
our chance?

1384
01:49:59,309 --> 01:50:01,606
Stop pretending you
aren't what you are.

1385
01:50:04,478 --> 01:50:05,569
One in billions.

1386
01:50:06,807 --> 01:50:08,054
Trillions.  Even more.

1387
01:50:11,247 --> 01:50:15,158
What greater meaning
can a life possibly have to offer?

1388
01:50:18,306 --> 01:50:21,320
I don't use my head
to fly the arrows, boy!

1389
01:50:22,804 --> 01:50:25,128
I use my heart.

1390
01:50:59,863 --> 01:51:02,833
You shouldn't have killed my
mom and squished my Walkman.

1391
01:51:44,019 --> 01:51:46,372
Groot! Groot, if you can
hear me, hurry up!

1392
01:51:46,833 --> 01:51:49,648
I'm not sure how long
Quill can keep him distracted!

1393
01:51:50,067 --> 01:51:51,121
Groot, hurry!

1394
01:52:48,001 --> 01:52:49,704
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1395
01:52:50,279 --> 01:52:51,063
Get to the ship!

1396
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:52,711
Not without Quill!

1397
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:54,594
You need to take care of the twig!

1398
01:52:56,394 --> 01:52:57,371
Not without you.

1399
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:02,061
I ain't got nothing right
my whole damn life, rat.

1400
01:53:06,222 --> 01:53:07,176
You need to give me this.

1401
01:53:18,473 --> 01:53:20,007
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1402
01:53:20,952 --> 01:53:22,424
I only have one of each.

1403
01:53:32,236 --> 01:53:33,792
I...

1404
01:53:35,736 --> 01:53:36,792
I am Groot!

1405
01:53:38,354 --> 01:53:39,150
What's that?

1406
01:53:40,782 --> 01:53:44,507
He says, Welcome to the frickin'
Guardians of the Galaxy.

1407
01:53:45,619 --> 01:53:47,778
Only he didn't use frickin'.

1408
01:53:54,317 --> 01:53:55,180
Bye, twig.

1409
01:53:57,144 --> 01:53:59,499
We're gonna have to have a real
discussion about your language.

1410
01:54:55,288 --> 01:54:56,038
Where's Peter?

1411
01:54:57,247 --> 01:54:58,021
Rocket, where is he?

1412
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:00,519
Rocket?

1413
01:55:01,045 --> 01:55:02,262
Rocket, look at me!
Where is he?

1414
01:55:09,078 --> 01:55:10,998
No, I'm not
leaving without him.

1415
01:55:18,163 --> 01:55:19,001
I'm sorry.

1416
01:55:19,849 --> 01:55:22,144
I can only afford to
lose one friend today.

1417
01:55:23,610 --> 01:55:24,459
Kraglin, go!

1418
01:55:25,396 --> 01:55:26,105
Wait.

1419
01:55:26,884 --> 01:55:27,908
Let's hold back.

1420
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:31,884
Rocket, where's Quill?

1421
01:55:33,711 --> 01:55:35,838
Rocket, where's Quill?

1422
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:39,267
Rocket!

1423
01:55:40,355 --> 01:55:41,488
Where's Quill?

1424
01:55:43,422 --> 01:55:44,781
Where's Quill?

1425
01:55:53,841 --> 01:55:56,271
No, we need to stop it.

1426
01:56:01,019 --> 01:56:02,074
We need to stop it.

1427
01:56:02,773 --> 01:56:04,231
Stop, listen!
Listen to me.

1428
01:56:04,856 --> 01:56:06,113
You are a god.

1429
01:56:07,580 --> 01:56:09,334
If you kill me...

1430
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:11,565
...you'll be just
like everybody else.

1431
01:56:12,898 --> 01:56:14,040
What's wrong with that?

1432
01:56:14,548 --> 01:56:15,455
No!

1433
01:57:06,733 --> 01:57:09,842
He may have been your father,
boy, but he wasn't your daddy.

1434
01:57:14,468 --> 01:57:16,378
I'm sorry I didn't
do none of it right.

1435
01:57:17,504 --> 01:57:20,099
Damn lucky you my boy.

1436
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:24,777
What?

1437
01:57:37,013 --> 01:57:37,982
Yondu, what are you doing?

1438
01:57:38,493 --> 01:57:39,444
You can't.

1439
01:57:40,058 --> 01:57:41,538
Yondu!

1440
01:57:47,645 --> 01:57:48,408
No.

1441
01:57:53,697 --> 01:57:54,256
No!

1442
01:57:57,802 --> 01:57:59,978
No!

1443
01:58:01,869 --> 01:58:02,704
Oh no!

1444
01:58:57,694 --> 01:58:59,045
I told Gamora...

1445
01:58:59,295 --> 01:59:02,955
...how when I was a kid, I used to
pretend David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1446
01:59:05,641 --> 01:59:08,456
He is a singer and actor
from Earth, really famous guy.

1447
01:59:10,358 --> 01:59:11,582
Earlier, it struck me...

1448
01:59:13,307 --> 01:59:17,187
...Yondu didn't have a talking car
but he did have a flying arrow.

1449
01:59:18,236 --> 01:59:20,234
He didn't have the beautiful
voice of an angel...

1450
01:59:20,690 --> 01:59:22,537
...but he did have
the whistle of one.

1451
01:59:22,986 --> 01:59:26,287
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...

1452
01:59:26,642 --> 01:59:28,958
...and hooked up with hot women...

1453
01:59:29,318 --> 01:59:30,796
...and fought robots.

1454
01:59:33,929 --> 01:59:37,736
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind
of end up being my dad after all.

1455
01:59:38,393 --> 01:59:39,822
Only, it was you, Yondu.

1456
01:59:45,913 --> 01:59:47,682
I had a pretty cool dad.

1457
01:59:50,632 --> 01:59:52,367
What I'm trying to say here is...

1458
01:59:54,273 --> 01:59:58,746
...sometimes the thing you're
searching for your whole life...

1459
02:00:01,202 --> 02:00:03,326
...it's right there
by your side all along.

1460
02:00:04,027 --> 02:00:05,870
You don't even know it.

1461
02:00:18,210 --> 02:00:18,937
I am Groot.

1462
02:00:20,602 --> 02:00:22,190
He did call you twig.

1463
02:00:25,009 --> 02:00:25,871
Nebula.

1464
02:00:31,204 --> 02:00:32,475
I was a child like you.

1465
02:00:34,108 --> 02:00:37,560
I was concerned with staying
alive until the next day, every day.

1466
02:00:38,117 --> 02:00:40,066
And I never considered what
Thanos was doing to you.

1467
02:00:41,274 --> 02:00:42,458
I'm trying to make it right.

1468
02:00:43,249 --> 02:00:44,355
There are little girls
like you across the universe...

1469
02:00:44,717 --> 02:00:46,919
...who are in danger.

1470
02:00:49,913 --> 02:00:51,327
You can stay with
us and help them.

1471
02:00:52,525 --> 02:00:54,695
I will help them
by killing Thanos.

1472
02:00:55,146 --> 02:00:56,718
I don't know if
that's possible.

1473
02:01:11,991 --> 02:01:13,299
You will always be my sister.

1474
02:01:58,262 --> 02:01:59,123
Pete!

1475
02:02:03,307 --> 02:02:04,970
The captain found this
for you in a junker shop,...

1476
02:02:05,272 --> 02:02:06,956
...said you'd come
back to the fold someday.

1477
02:02:09,618 --> 02:02:10,394
What is it?

1478
02:02:10,834 --> 02:02:11,965
It's called a Zune.

1479
02:02:12,191 --> 02:02:13,843
It's what everybody's listening
to on Earth nowadays.

1480
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:15,641
It's got 300 songs on it.

1481
02:02:16,001 --> 02:02:16,841
300 songs?

1482
02:02:22,973 --> 02:02:23,677
Wait.

1483
02:02:30,446 --> 02:02:32,323
Rocket grabbed the
pieces and re-assembled it.

1484
02:02:32,584 --> 02:02:34,163
But I think Yondu would
want you to have it.

1485
02:02:38,048 --> 02:02:38,923
Thanks.

1486
02:02:41,312 --> 02:02:42,268
Cap'n.

1487
02:03:05,625 --> 02:03:08,585
<i>Father And Son:
Cat Stevens</i>

1488
02:03:54,293 --> 02:03:55,284
They came.

1489
02:04:03,395 --> 02:04:04,665
What is it?

1490
02:04:06,271 --> 02:04:09,830
I sent word to Yondu's
old Ravager buddies.

1491
02:04:10,711 --> 02:04:12,059
He did not (disappoint us).

1492
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:21,762
Fare thee well, old friend.

1493
02:04:22,970 --> 02:04:26,940
Yondu Udonta, I will
see you in the stars.

1494
02:04:31,316 --> 02:04:33,462
He didn't chase them away.

1495
02:04:33,519 --> 02:04:34,115
No.

1496
02:04:35,492 --> 02:04:36,828
Even though he yelled at 'em.

1497
02:04:37,708 --> 02:04:39,181
And was always mean.

1498
02:04:41,771 --> 02:04:43,275
And he stole batteries
he didn't need.

1499
02:04:49,498 --> 02:04:50,677
Well of course not.

1500
02:05:15,172 --> 02:05:16,013
What?

1501
02:05:16,962 --> 02:05:18,354
It's just...

1502
02:05:20,784 --> 02:05:22,510
...some unspoken thing.

1503
02:05:32,453 --> 02:05:34,063
It's beautiful.

1504
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:37,294
Yes.

1505
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:39,947
And so are you.

1506
02:05:43,054 --> 02:05:43,932
On the inside.

1507
02:06:17,269 --> 02:06:19,989
<i>THE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY
WILL RETURN.</i></i>

1508
02:06:41,011 --> 02:06:44,991
Ah! Ahhh!

1509
02:06:55,090 --> 02:07:05,090
~ subtitles transcribed by Scram.Cypher ~

1510
02:07:39,851 --> 02:07:41,319
You know, it's a shame...

1511
02:07:41,643 --> 02:07:45,270
...that it took the tragedy of
losing Yondu to bring us all together again.

1512
02:07:46,079 --> 02:07:49,408
But I think he'd be proud knowing
that we're back as a team.

1513
02:07:50,133 --> 02:07:50,753
Amen.

1514
02:07:51,770 --> 02:07:52,370
~Telp.

1515
02:07:52,409 --> 02:07:54,243
I missed you guys so much!

1516
02:07:54,360 --> 02:07:55,491
Hell yes.

1517
02:07:58,748 --> 02:08:00,112
What say we steal some shit?

1518
02:10:19,703 --> 02:10:21,889
High Priestess, the
council is waiting.

1519
02:10:22,964 --> 02:10:25,615
They are perturbed I've
wasted our resources.

1520
02:10:30,577 --> 02:10:32,269
When they see what
I have created here...

1521
02:10:33,486 --> 02:10:35,517
...their wrath will dissipate.

1522
02:10:37,174 --> 02:10:39,169
It's a new type of
birthing pod, ma'am?

1523
02:10:40,779 --> 02:10:42,052
That, my child,...

1524
02:10:42,811 --> 02:10:44,517
...is the next
step in our evolution.

1525
02:10:44,996 --> 02:10:47,112
More powerful, more beautiful...

1526
02:10:47,881 --> 02:10:51,781
...more capable of destroying
the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1527
02:10:54,913 --> 02:10:57,293
I think I shall call him...

1528
02:10:59,097 --> 02:11:00,018
...Adam.

1529
02:13:02,097 --> 02:13:05,018
Ugh. Dude!

1530
02:13:05,197 --> 02:13:06,118
Seriously?

1531
02:13:06,197 --> 02:13:08,518
You gotta clean up your room,
it's a complete mess!

1532
02:13:08,897 --> 02:13:10,018
I am Groot.

1533
02:13:10,397 --> 02:13:12,218
I'm not boring,
you're boring.

1534
02:13:12,797 --> 02:13:15,218
You know what's boring,
sitting there playing that...

1535
02:13:15,297 --> 02:13:20,518
...mind numbing game.  What's boring
is me tripping over your vines every day.

1536
02:13:20,897 --> 02:13:22,018
I'm not boring.

1537
02:13:22,897 --> 02:13:24,018
I am Groot.

1538
02:13:25,597 --> 02:13:27,318
Now I know how Yondu felt.

1539
02:14:03,097 --> 02:14:05,318
It is time to part.

1540
02:14:06,797 --> 02:14:08,018
Just remember...

1541
02:14:09,097 --> 02:14:14,018
...We. Are. Groot.

1542
02:14:16,797 --> 02:14:18,018
Hey, fellas.

1543
02:14:18,397 --> 02:14:19,718
Hey, wait, where are you going?

1544
02:14:19,997 --> 02:14:22,018
Hey, you were supposed
to be my lift home!

1545
02:14:22,397 --> 02:14:23,918
How will I get outta here?

1546
02:14:24,097 --> 02:14:28,018
Hey, ah gee, I got so
many more stories to tell!

1547
02:14:28,497 --> 02:14:31,518
Aw, guys.
Oh, jeez.
