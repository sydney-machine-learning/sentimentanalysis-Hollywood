1
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,598
Now, I know what you're thinking.

2
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:00,135
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"

3
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,100
Well, sometimes you have to get captured

4
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,987
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.

5
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,435
It's a long story,
but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.

6
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,203
See, I spent some time on Earth...

7
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,736
Fought some robots,
saved the planet a couple of times.

8
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,664
Then I went searching through the cosmos

9
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,664
for some magic,
colorful Infinity Stone things.

10
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,956
Didn't find any.

11
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:28,166
That's when I came across
a path of death and destruction,

12
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,008
which led me all the way here
into this cage,

13
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,008
where I met you.

14
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,850
How much longer do you think
we'll be here?

15
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:59,578
Thor, son of Odin.

16
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,420
Surtur, son of a bitch.

17
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:04,672
You're still alive.

18
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:09,002
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.

19
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,801
I cannot die.

20
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,724
Not until I fulfill my destiny

21
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,143
and lay waste to your home.

22
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,802
It's funny you should mention that.

23
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,260
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.

24
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,681
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.

25
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,640
And you, Surtur,
are at the center of all of them.

26
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,651
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.

27
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,685
- The great prophecy...
- Hang on.

28
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,109
Hang on.

29
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:36,452
I'll be back around shortly.

30
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,455
I really feel like
we were connecting there.

31
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,330
Okay, so Ragnarok.
Tell me about that. Walk me through it.

32
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,499
My time has come.

33
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,798
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame,

34
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,633
I shall be restored to my full might.

35
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,049
I will tower over the mountains,

36
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,798
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...

37
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,511
Hang on. Give it a second.

38
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,602
I swear, I'm not even moving.
It's just doing this on its own.

39
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,348
I'm really sorry.

40
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,984
Okay, so let me get this straight.

41
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,777
You're going to put your crown
into the Eternal Flame

42
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,323
and then you'll suddenly grow as big
as a house?

43
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,647
A mountain!

44
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,872
The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps
locked away on Asgard?

45
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,583
Odin is not on Asgard.

46
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,664
And your absence has left the throne
defenseless.

47
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,672
Okay, so where is it? This crown?

48
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,884
This is my crown,
the source of my power.

49
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,634
Oh, that's a crown.
I thought it was a big eyebrow.

50
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:36,969
It's a crown.

51
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,644
Anyway, it sounds like
all I have to do to stop Ragnarok

52
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,604
is rip that thing off your head.

53
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,385
But Ragnarok has already begun.

54
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,480
You cannot stop it.

55
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,161
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.

56
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,915
All will suffer, all will burn.

57
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,788
That's intense.

58
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,785
To be honest,
seeing you grow really big

59
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,457
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.

60
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,304
But it looks like I'm gonna have to
choose option B,

61
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,213
where I bust out of these chains,

62
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,261
knock that tiara off your head,
and stash it away in Asgard's vault.

63
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,387
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

64
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,805
Why fight it?

65
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,475
Because that's what heroes do.

66
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,530
Wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't time that right.

67
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,779
And, now!

68
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,953
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,750
I make grave mistakes all the time.

70
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,170
Everything seems to work out.

71
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:16,708
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,
but I could really use a fast exit.

72
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:19,632
Heimdall?

73
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,511
Heimdall was an idiot.

74
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,634
This job should have made him rich.

75
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,052
Now, the job ain't easy

76
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,141
but it does have its benefits.

77
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:33,556
The Bifrost gives me access to
everything the Nine Realms has to offer.

78
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,017
I mean, it's all mine for the taking.

79
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,689
Behold...

80
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,189
My stuff.

81
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,026
I'm particularly fond of these.

82
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:49,738
I pulled them out of a place on Midgard
called Texas.

83
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,950
I even named them. Des and Troy.

84
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,169
You see, when you put them together,

85
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,417
they destroy.

86
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,399
Heimdall, come on.

87
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:40,593
Stay!

88
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:45,217
Heimdall?
I'm running short on options.

89
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,087
Heimdall?

90
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,635
Skurge?

91
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,270
Is that important?

92
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,151
You girls are in for a treat.

93
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,255
Girls!

94
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:02,921
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to pop in.

95
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:06,885
Thanks for scaring away my company
and drenching my workplace in brains.

96
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,047
Who are you?

97
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,301
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.
We fought together on Vanaheim.

98
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,718
Right. Where is Heimdall?

99
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,891
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.

100
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,682
Traitor?

101
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:21,441
Yeah. You see, Odin charged Heimdall
with negligence of duty

102
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,523
but he disappeared before the trial.

103
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:26,009
Hard to catch a guy who can see
everything in the universe.

104
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,066
Sure.

105
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,690
Hold on.
I'm supposed to announce your arrival.

106
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,347
What the hell is that?

107
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,058
Oh, brother. This is it.

108
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,611
I take my leave.

109
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,488
You fool, you didn't listen!

110
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,702
I'm sorry.

111
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:12,902
Lady Sif, get help!

112
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,201
Somebody, help!

113
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,410
Sorry for all I've done.

114
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,329
It's all right. Hold on.

115
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,905
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.

116
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,420
They'd be lucky to have you.

117
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,422
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.

118
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,382
- I just couldn't help myself.
- I know.

119
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,745
I'm a trickster.

120
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,762
So mischievous.

121
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,629
Sorry about that time I turned you
into a frog.

122
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,221
It was a wonderful joke.

123
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,510
'Twas indeed hilarious.

124
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,890
You are the savior of Asgard.

125
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,888
- Tell my story.
- I will.

126
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,310
Build a statue for me.

127
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,188
We will build a big statue for you.

128
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:49,235
With my helmet on,
with the big bendy horns.

129
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,360
I will tell Father
what you did here today.

130
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,238
I didn't do it for him.

131
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,123
I didn't do it for him.

132
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,957
No!

133
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:15,378
And so, Loki died of his wounds,

134
00:11:15,551 --> 00:11:17,471
giving his life for ours.

135
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,306
He fought back those disgusting elves,

136
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,272
he brought peace to the realm.

137
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,732
Loki, my boy...

138
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:29,234
'Twas many moons ago I found you
on that frostbitten battlefield.

139
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,480
On that day,
I did not yet see in you

140
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,941
Asgard's savior. No.

141
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:39,622
You were merely
a little blue baby icicle

142
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,619
that melted this old fool's heart.

143
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:48,583
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.

144
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,378
Father.

145
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,474
Shit.

146
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,135
My son, Thor, has returned!

147
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,803
Greetings, my boy.

148
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,194
It's an interesting play.
What's it called?

149
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:08,439
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.
The people wanted to commemorate him.

150
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:09,904
Indeed they should.

151
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,403
I like the statue.

152
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,877
A lot better looking than he was
when he was alive, though.

153
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,781
A little less weaselly, less greasy,
maybe.

154
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,859
Do you know what this is?

155
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,741
The skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon!

156
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,470
Do me a favor.
Lock this away in a vault

157
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,830
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster
and destroy the whole planet.

158
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,502
Thank you, dear.

159
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,884
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?

160
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,169
Nope.

161
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,384
I've been having this reoccurring dream
lately.

162
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,340
Every night,
I see Asgard fall into ruins.

163
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:42,642
That's just a silly dream,

164
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,764
signs of an overactive imagination.

165
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:45,932
Possibly.

166
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,096
But then I decide to go out there
and investigate.

167
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:52,235
And what do I find,
but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.

168
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,357
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise,

169
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:58,446
all while you, Odin,
the protector of those Nine Realms,

170
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,362
are sitting here in your bathrobe,
eating grapes.

171
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,782
Yes, it is best
to respect our neighbors' freedom.

172
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,951
Yes, of course,
the freedom to be massacred.

173
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,785
Yes, besides I've been
rather busy myself.

174
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:11,958
Watching theater.

175
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,035
Board meetings,
and security council meetings...

176
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,051
- You're really gonna make me do it?
- Do what?

177
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:24,009
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir
as it returns to my hand.

178
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,639
Not even your face.

179
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,056
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.

180
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,735
Then I'll see you on the other side,
brother.

181
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:33,611
All right, I yield.

182
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:44,699
Behold!

183
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:46,869
Thor...

184
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,041
- Odinson.
- No.

185
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,041
You had one job. Just the one.

186
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,205
Where's Odin?

187
00:13:56,378 --> 00:14:00,168
You just couldn't stay away, could you?
Everything was fine without you.

188
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,010
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.

189
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,308
- Ask them.
- Where's Father? Did you kill him?

190
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,865
You had what you wanted.
You had the independence you asked for.

191
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,810
Okay. I know exactly where he is.

192
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,946
I swear I left him right here.

193
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,429
Right here on the sidewalk, or right there
where the building is being demolished?

194
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:30,583
Great planning.

195
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:31,872
How was I supposed to know?

196
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,600
Can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.

197
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,544
No? Then why do you dress like one?

198
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,923
- Hey.
- I can't believe you're alive.

199
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,086
I saw you die.
I mourned you, I cried for you.

200
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:42,803
I'm honored.

201
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:43,966
Ask him.

202
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,854
Hi. Would you mind taking a picture
with us?

203
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:46,969
Sure.

204
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:49,763
Start figuring out where he is.

205
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:51,766
Oh, my God.

206
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,250
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.

207
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,811
She didn't dump me, you know.

208
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,108
I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.

209
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,072
What's this? What are you doing?

210
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:03,454
This isn't me.

211
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:08,783
Loki.

212
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,849
Thor Odinson.

213
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,951
God of Thunder.

214
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,664
You can put down the umbrella.

215
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,350
So, Earth has wizards now?

216
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,478
The preferred term is
"Master of the Mystic Arts."

217
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:19,562
You can leave that now.

218
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:23,441
All right, wizard. Who are you?
Why should I care?

219
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:27,951
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,
and I have some questions for you.

220
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:29,197
Take a seat.

221
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:35,366
Tea?

222
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,125
I don't drink tea.

223
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,501
What do you drink?

224
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,877
Not tea.

225
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,838
So, I keep a watch list of individuals
and beings from other realms

226
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,409
that may be a threat to this world.

227
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:54,179
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

228
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,266
He's a worthy inclusion.

229
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,602
Then why bring him here?

230
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,401
We're looking for my father.

231
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:06,108
So, if I were to tell you
where Odin was,

232
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,606
all parties concerned
would promptly return to Asgard?

233
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:09,779
Promptly.

234
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:11,277
Great! Then I'll help you.

235
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:13,657
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?

236
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,686
I have to tell you, he was adamant
that he not be disturbed.

237
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,868
Your father said he had chosen
to remain in exile.

238
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,132
And you don't have a phone.

239
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,205
No, I don't have a phone,

240
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,019
but you could have sent an electronic
letter. It's called an email.

241
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,971
- Yeah, do you have a computer?
- No. What for?

242
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,973
Anyway, my father is no longer in exile.

243
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,887
So if you could tell me where he is,
I can take him home.

244
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,927
Gladly. He's in Norway.

245
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:45,193
I'm just seeing whether this incantation
requires any Asgardian modifications.

246
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:46,939
Nope.

247
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,031
We don't need that.

248
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:56,277
Will you stop doing that?

249
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:01,292
I need just one strand of your hair.

250
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:04,246
Let me explain something.
My hair is not to be meddled with.

251
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,258
We could have just walked.

252
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,724
He's waiting for you.

253
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:20,101
All right.

254
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:21,727
Don't forget your umbrella.

255
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:23,064
Yes.

256
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:31,951
Sorry.

257
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,198
There we go.

258
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:38,662
I suppose I'll need my brother back.

259
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,120
Yeah. Right.

260
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,496
I have been falling for 30 minutes!

261
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:51,797
You can handle him from here.

262
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,881
Yes. Of course.
Thank you very much for your help.

263
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,052
Good luck.

264
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,216
Handle me? Who are you?

265
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,056
Loki.

266
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,534
You think you're some kind of sorcerer?

267
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,244
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...

268
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,268
Bye-bye.

269
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:30,843
Father?

270
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:35,086
Look at this place. It's beautiful.

271
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:41,969
Father, it's us.

272
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,847
My sons.

273
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,146
I've been waiting for you.

274
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:50,963
I know. We've come to take you home.

275
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:52,897
Home, yes.

276
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,865
Your mother, she calls me.

277
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,366
Do you hear it?

278
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:03,951
Loki, lift your magic.

279
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,253
Took me quite a while
to break free from your spell.

280
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:10,918
Frigga would have been proud.

281
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:12,846
Come and sit with me.
I don't have much time.

282
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:21,934
I know we failed you.

283
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:23,519
But we can make this right.

284
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:25,523
I failed you.

285
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,768
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

286
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,106
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.

287
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:33,824
No.

288
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,439
It has already begun. She's coming.

289
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:40,908
My life was all that held her back.
But my time has come.

290
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:45,411
I cannot keep her away any longer.

291
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,536
Father, who are you talking about?

292
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:51,168
Goddess of Death. Hela.

293
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,802
My firstborn.

294
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:55,922
Your sister.

295
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,759
Your what?

296
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:06,062
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.

297
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:11,516
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her.
Locked her away.

298
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,819
She draws her strength from Asgard,

299
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:20,657
and once she gets there,
her powers will be limitless.

300
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,593
Whatever she is, we can stop her together.
We can face her together.

301
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:24,617
No, we won't.

302
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,911
I'm on a different path now.

303
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,540
This you must face alone.

304
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,632
I love you, my sons.

305
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:37,838
Look at that.

306
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,430
Remember this place.

307
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,472
Home.

308
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:27,395
Brother.

309
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,899
This was your doing.

310
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,689
So he's gone.

311
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:27,704
That's a shame.
I would've liked to have seen that.

312
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:29,698
You must be Hela.

313
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,660
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

314
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:36,326
Really? You don't look like him.

315
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,542
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.

316
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,590
You sound like him.

317
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:43,669
Kneel.

318
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:45,181
Beg your pardon?

319
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:51,063
Kneel.

320
00:23:54,268 --> 00:23:56,018
Before your queen.

321
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:58,692
I don't think so.

322
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:11,528
It's not possible.

323
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:16,331
Darling, you have no idea
what's possible.

324
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:37,438
Bring us back!

325
00:24:37,603 --> 00:24:38,603
No!

326
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:48,776
Loki!

327
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,509
Who are you?
What have you done with Thor?

328
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:43,786
I'm Hela.

329
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:47,706
I'm just a janitor.

330
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:52,302
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.

331
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:57,064
How would you like a job?

332
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:10,018
Are you a fighter?

333
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:12,186
Or are you food?

334
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,284
I'm just passing through.

335
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:16,365
It is food.

336
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,660
On your knees.

337
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:01,866
He's mine.

338
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:12,214
Wait!

339
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,221
Wait!

340
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:25,563
He's mine.

341
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:28,944
So if you want him, you go through me.

342
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:30,522
But we've already got him.

343
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:35,154
All right, then.
I guess I go through you.

344
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:37,152
More food.

345
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:13,865
Thank you.

346
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:52,689
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.

347
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:54,945
I've got something special.

348
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:57,435
Hey! Where are you taking me?

349
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:00,074
Answer me!

350
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,570
Hey!

351
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:04,357
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.

352
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:07,369
Many apologies, your majesty.

353
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:39,941
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.

354
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:50,447
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn,

355
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:52,999
the commander
of the Legions of Asgard,

356
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:56,543
the rightful heir to the throne,
and the Goddess of Death.

357
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:03,718
My father is dead.

358
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:05,762
As are the princes.
You're welcome.

359
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:09,855
We were once the seat
of absolute power in the cosmos.

360
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,183
Our supremacy was unchallenged.

361
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:15,439
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.

362
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:19,022
Our destiny is to rule over all others.

363
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:22,977
And I am here to restore that power.

364
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:25,991
Kneel before me

365
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:30,204
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.

366
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:33,327
Whoever you are,

367
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:36,495
whatever you've done, surrender now!

368
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:38,885
Or we will show you no mercy.

369
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:43,252
Whoever I am?
Did you listen to a word I said?

370
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:45,472
This is your last warning!

371
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:49,928
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

372
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:56,807
Fine.

373
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:11,525
Charge!

374
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:07,921
I've missed this.

375
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:10,007
Still, it's a shame.

376
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:12,594
Good soldiers dying for nothing,

377
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:14,968
all because
they couldn't see the future.

378
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:16,604
Sad.

379
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:19,853
Look, still alive.

380
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:29,111
Change of heart?

381
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:31,738
Go back to whatever cave
you crept out of.

382
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:34,408
You evil demoness!

383
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,503
Let's go see my palace.

384
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:13,701
Fear not, for you are found.

385
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:17,742
You are home,
and there is no going back.

386
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:23,121
No one leaves this place.

387
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,960
But what is this place?

388
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:28,335
The answer is Sakaar.

389
00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:31,674
Surrounded by cosmic gateways,

390
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:35,389
Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.

391
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:39,102
It is the collection point
for all lost and unloved things.

392
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:40,974
Like you.

393
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:43,891
But here on Sakaar, you are significant.

394
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:45,561
You are valuable.

395
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,109
Here you are loved.

396
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:48,272
What the hell?

397
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,570
And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.

398
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:55,905
He is the original,
the first lost and the first found.

399
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:57,243
The creator of Sakaar,

400
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:00,657
and father of the Contest of Champions.

401
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:05,117
Where once you were nothing,
now you are something.

402
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,460
You are the property of the Grandmaster.

403
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:10,087
Congratulations!

404
00:36:10,254 --> 00:36:13,764
You will meet the Grandmaster
in five seconds.

405
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:15,512
Prepare yourself.

406
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:18,511
Prepare yourself.

407
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:23,595
You are now meeting the Grandmaster.

408
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:38,623
He's wonderful.
It is a he?

409
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:40,084
It is a he.

410
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:41,242
Yeah.

411
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:43,326
I love when you come to visit, 142.

412
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:45,042
You bring me the best stuff.

413
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:48,745
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz,
about Scrapper 142,

414
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:52,457
what do I always say? "She is the..."
And it starts with a "B."

415
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:53,669
Trash.

416
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:56,553
No, not trash.

417
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:00,392
Were you waiting just to call her that?
It doesn't start with a "B."

418
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:01,684
Booze hag.

419
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:06,689
I'm so sorry. No, "best."
I was thinking about "best."

420
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:08,204
'Cause I always say you're the best.

421
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:10,148
She brought me my beloved champion,
you know.

422
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:12,114
You say that every time she's here.

423
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:13,754
What have you brought today? Tell me.

424
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:14,901
A contender.

425
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:16,148
A what?

426
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,464
I need to go closer.
I want to get a closer look at this.

427
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:20,448
Can you take us closer? Thank you.

428
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:34,003
Pay this lady.

429
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:35,921
Just wait a damn minute.

430
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:38,509
I'm not for sale.

431
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:46,393
Man, he's a fighter.

432
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:47,888
I take 10 million.

433
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,100
Tell her she's dreaming.

434
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:51,229
For heaven's sakes, transfer the units.

435
00:37:58,237 --> 00:37:59,817
You'll pay for this.

436
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:01,358
No, I got paid for this.

437
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,740
Here's what I wanna know.

438
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:07,411
Who are you?

439
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:11,666
I am the God of Thunder.

440
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:18,338
I didn't hear any thunder, but out of your
fingers, was that sparkles?

441
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:20,884
We've located your cousin.

442
00:38:21,802 --> 00:38:22,892
Good!

443
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:25,223
Yeah, come on.
I think you're gonna like this.

444
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:26,389
There he is.

445
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:27,723
Hey, cuz.

446
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:30,605
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?

447
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:31,769
Hi.

448
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,690
So...

449
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:35,937
Please.

450
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,150
I'm sorry.

451
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:39,488
Yeah.

452
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:40,903
Carlo...

453
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,240
I pardon you.

454
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:44,777
Thank you.

455
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:45,950
Thank you.

456
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:49,165
You're officially pardoned.
From life.

457
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:56,127
Help me.

458
00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:59,592
Oh, my God!

459
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:01,756
I'm stepping in it.
I'm stepping in it. Look!

460
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:05,716
The smell.

461
00:39:06,138 --> 00:39:07,348
What does it smell like?

462
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:08,724
Burnt toast.

463
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:11,556
What happened to my manners?

464
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:13,402
I haven't properly introduced myself.

465
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:15,482
Come on. Follow me.

466
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:17,898
My name is Grandmaster.

467
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:21,486
I preside over a little harlequinade
called the Contest of Champions.

468
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:24,363
People come from far and wide
to unwillingly participate in it.

469
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:27,241
And you, my friend,
might just be part of the new cast.

470
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:28,409
What do you say to that?

471
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:30,722
We're not friends and I don't give a shit
about your games.

472
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:32,076
I'm going back to Asgard.

473
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:33,749
Ass-gard.

474
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:37,337
One, two, three, four.

475
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:40,955
There was a wormhole
in space and time beneath me.

476
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:44,051
At that moment, I let go.

477
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,640
Loki?

478
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:48,639
Loki! Loki!

479
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:50,675
Over here. Over here.

480
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:53,637
- Excuse me one second.
- Loki!

481
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:56,601
- What?
- You're alive?

482
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:58,708
- Yes, of course I'm alive.
- What are you doing here?

483
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:00,877
What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.

484
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:02,587
- Where's your chair?
- I didn't get a chair.

485
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:04,339
- Get me out of this one. Get me out.
- I can't.

486
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:05,573
- I can't.
- What?

487
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,425
I've made friends with this man.
He's called the Grandmaster.

488
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:08,927
- He's crazy!
- I've gained his favor.

489
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:10,591
The Bifrost brought me out here
weeks ago.

490
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:11,832
- Weeks ago?
- Yes.

491
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:12,995
I just got here.

492
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:14,363
What are you whispering about?

493
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:17,217
Time works real different
around these parts.

494
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:20,416
On any other world, I'd be, like,
millions of years old.

495
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:22,207
But here on Sakaar...

496
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:30,306
In any case, you know this...

497
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:31,832
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?

498
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:34,230
God of Thunder.
Tell him.

499
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:36,063
I've never met this man in my life.

500
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:37,848
- He's my brother.
- Adopted.

501
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:39,151
Is he any kind of a fighter?

502
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:41,584
You take this thing out of my neck
and I'll show you.

503
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:43,318
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.

504
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:45,445
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.

505
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:47,862
If you wanna get back to Ass-place,
Assberg...

506
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:48,948
Asgard.

507
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:52,122
Any contender who defeats my champion,

508
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:54,042
their freedom they shall win.

509
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:57,424
Fine. Then point me in the direction
of whoever's ass I have to kick!

510
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:00,133
That's what I call, contender.

511
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:02,714
Direction would be this way, Lord.

512
00:41:03,422 --> 00:41:04,422
Loki!

513
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:12,256
Hey. Take it easy, man.

514
00:41:13,932 --> 00:41:14,932
Over here.

515
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,690
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.

516
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:19,402
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.

517
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:20,623
Allow me to introduce myself.

518
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:22,727
My name is Korg.
I'm kind of like the leader in here.

519
00:41:22,816 --> 00:41:26,236
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.
But don't let that intimidate you.

520
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:29,323
You don't need to be afraid
unless you're made of scissors.

521
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,779
Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke
for you.

522
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,700
This is my very good friend over here,
Miek.

523
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,620
He's an insect and has knives for hands.

524
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:39,708
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

525
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:42,465
- That I am.
- How'd you end up in here?

526
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:45,588
Well, I tried to start a revolution,
but didn't print enough pamphlets.

527
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:49,926
So hardly anyone turned up, except for
my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.

528
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:53,933
As punishment, I was forced
to be in here and become a gladiator.

529
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:55,697
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.

530
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:58,444
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

531
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:00,663
I don't know if you'd be interested
in something like that.

532
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:02,607
Do you reckon you'd be interested?

533
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:05,865
How did you...

534
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:08,736
Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.

535
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:12,074
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.

536
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:14,911
- This doesn't make any sense.
- No, nothing makes sense here, man.

537
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:18,077
The only thing that does make sense
is that nothing makes sense.

538
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:20,577
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

539
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:21,829
Doug has.

540
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Doug!

541
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:24,338
Our luck, Doug's dead.

542
00:42:24,503 --> 00:42:25,503
That's right.

543
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:28,007
Everyone who fights
the Grandmaster's champion perishes.

544
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,760
What about you? You're made of rocks.

545
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:32,595
Perishable rock.
There you go. Another one gone.

546
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:36,601
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

547
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:38,515
Wait. You're not gonna face him,
are you?

548
00:42:38,684 --> 00:42:40,144
Yes, I am.

549
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,560
Gonna fight him, win,
and get the hell out of this place.

550
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:46,109
That's exactly what Doug used to say.

551
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:48,115
See you later, new Doug.

552
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:59,661
Does no one remember me?

553
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:02,790
Has no one been taught our history?

554
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,840
Look at these lies.

555
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:12,009
Goblets and garden parties?

556
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:15,889
Peace treaties?

557
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,930
Odin...

558
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:19,718
Proud to have it,

559
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:21,272
ashamed of how he got it.

560
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:42,620
We were unstoppable.

561
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:47,379
I was his weapon in the conquest
that built Asgard's empire.

562
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:53,510
One by one, the realms became ours.

563
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:57,885
But then,
simply because my ambition outgrew his,

564
00:43:58,055 --> 00:44:02,735
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.

565
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:05,766
Before that,
Asgard's warriors were honored,

566
00:44:05,938 --> 00:44:09,568
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.

567
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:22,502
- Odin's treasures.
- Fake.

568
00:44:24,665 --> 00:44:27,215
Most of the stuff in here is fake.

569
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:29,003
Or weak.

570
00:44:31,088 --> 00:44:33,088
Smaller than I thought it would be.

571
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:36,054
That's not bad.

572
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:37,508
But this...

573
00:44:38,095 --> 00:44:40,225
The Eternal Flame.

574
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:10,625
Want to see what true power
really looks like?

575
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:42,243
Fenris, my darling,
what have they done to you?

576
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:48,793
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

577
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:06,309
I've missed you.

578
00:46:07,142 --> 00:46:09,062
I've missed you all.

579
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:12,812
Odin,

580
00:46:13,065 --> 00:46:16,365
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla,

581
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:18,897
where the brave shall live forever.

582
00:46:20,322 --> 00:46:22,742
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice,

583
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:25,618
for those that have died
the glorious death.

584
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:35,089
Hurts, doesn't it?

585
00:46:35,254 --> 00:46:36,254
Being lied to.

586
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:40,717
Being told you're one thing
and then learning it's all a fiction.

587
00:46:45,556 --> 00:46:47,676
You didn't think
I'd really come and see you, did you?

588
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:49,484
This place is disgusting.

589
00:46:52,354 --> 00:46:54,234
Does this mean you don't want my help?

590
00:46:54,398 --> 00:46:56,543
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position
with the Grandmaster.

591
00:46:56,567 --> 00:46:59,527
It took me time to win his trust.
He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.

592
00:46:59,695 --> 00:47:02,955
What I'm telling you is, you could
join me at the Grandmaster's side.

593
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:07,745
Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls
the Grandmaster, and then...

594
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:16,287
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?

595
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:22,719
Our sister destroyed your hammer
like a piece of glass.

596
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:25,572
She's stronger than both of us.
She's stronger than you.

597
00:47:25,596 --> 00:47:27,006
You don't stand a chance.

598
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:29,351
Do you understand
what I'm saying here?

599
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:34,850
Fine.

600
00:47:37,482 --> 00:47:40,072
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.

601
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:41,986
Like I've always done.

602
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:46,280
Would you say something?

603
00:47:48,952 --> 00:47:50,502
Say something!

604
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:53,832
What would you like me to say?

605
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:56,418
You faked your own death,

606
00:47:56,585 --> 00:47:59,095
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power,

607
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:02,554
stranded him on Earth to die,
releasing the Goddess of Death.

608
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:06,430
Have I said enough or would you like me
to go back further than the past two days?

609
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:11,645
You know, I haven't seen this
beloved champion he talks of,

610
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:13,808
but I've heard
he is astonishingly savage.

611
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,190
I've placed a large wager against you
tomorrow.

612
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,570
Don't let me down.

613
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:25,029
Piss off, ghost!

614
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:29,081
He's freaking gone.

615
00:48:37,376 --> 00:48:38,376
Yuck!

616
00:48:38,544 --> 00:48:40,624
There's still someone's hair and blood
all over this.

617
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:43,474
Guys, can you clean up the weapons
once you finish your fight?

618
00:48:43,632 --> 00:48:44,632
Disgusting slobs.

619
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,430
Thor,

620
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:49,604
wanna use a big wooden fork?

621
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:51,097
No.

622
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:52,351
Yeah, not really useful.

623
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:55,984
Unless you're fighting off three vampires
that were huddled together.

624
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:58,315
I really wish I had my hammer.

625
00:48:58,730 --> 00:48:59,730
Hammer?

626
00:48:59,815 --> 00:49:00,825
Quite unique.

627
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:03,609
It was made from this special metal
from the heart of a dying star.

628
00:49:04,152 --> 00:49:06,952
And when I spun it really, really fast,
it gave me the ability to fly.

629
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:08,244
You rode a hammer?

630
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:09,947
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

631
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:11,437
The hammer rode you on your back?

632
00:49:11,577 --> 00:49:14,947
No. I used to spin it really fast,
and it would pull me off the...

633
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:17,122
Oh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?

634
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:21,001
The ground. It would pull me off the
ground, up into the air, and I would fly.

635
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:24,170
Every time I threw it,
it would always come back to me.

636
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:27,152
Sounds like you had a pretty special
and intimate relationship with this hammer

637
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:30,296
and that losing it was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.

638
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:33,431
That's a nice way of putting it.

639
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:36,428
I said they're mine.

640
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:39,769
See her,
that's the one that put me in here.

641
00:49:39,938 --> 00:49:42,108
Yeah. Scrapper 142.

642
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:44,324
Gotta watch out
for those Asgardians, man.

643
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:46,154
They are hard to perish.

644
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,780
Asgardian?

645
00:49:49,323 --> 00:49:50,323
Hey.

646
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:51,532
Hey.

647
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:53,201
Hey.

648
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,080
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.

649
00:49:57,831 --> 00:49:59,251
Asgard is in danger.

650
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:05,302
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

651
00:50:06,757 --> 00:50:08,610
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger,

652
00:50:08,634 --> 00:50:10,974
until I found out that
you were all women.

653
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:13,417
There's nothing wrong with women,
of course. I love women.

654
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:15,022
Sometimes a little too much.

655
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:18,182
Not in a creepy way,
just more of a respectful appreciation.

656
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:22,812
I think it's great that there is
an elite force of women warriors.

657
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:24,481
It's about time.

658
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:27,068
Are you done?

659
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:28,213
Lord of Thunder, you're up.

660
00:50:28,237 --> 00:50:29,339
Please, help me. I need your help.

661
00:50:29,363 --> 00:50:30,363
Bye.

662
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:32,701
Fine, then you must be a traitor
or a coward.

663
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:35,196
Because the Valkyrie is sworn to protect
the throne.

664
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:39,211
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

665
00:50:39,373 --> 00:50:41,213
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.

666
00:50:44,503 --> 00:50:46,423
Bring him in for processing.

667
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:50,468
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.

668
00:51:02,354 --> 00:51:03,944
Now, don't you move.

669
00:51:04,106 --> 00:51:06,726
My hands ain't as steady
as they used to be.

670
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,900
By Odin's beard,
you shall not cut my hair,

671
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,490
lest you feel the wrath
of the mighty Thor.

672
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:19,410
Please.
Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.

673
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:22,044
Please! No!

674
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:23,327
No!

675
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:39,894
Look at all of you.
What a show! What a night!

676
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:41,058
Who's having fun?

677
00:51:42,227 --> 00:51:44,187
Please, I'm your host.

678
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:47,574
Big round of applause
for all of our undercard competitors,

679
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:50,533
who today died so gruesomely.

680
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:51,904
Good sports.

681
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,740
What a show! What a night!

682
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:58,118
This is what you've come for,
and so have I.

683
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:06,790
And now, without further ado,

684
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,460
it's main event time.

685
00:52:11,173 --> 00:52:14,513
Making his first appearance,
though he looks quite promising,

686
00:52:14,676 --> 00:52:16,506
got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.

687
00:52:17,095 --> 00:52:19,715
I'll say no more, see what you think.

688
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:21,290
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...

689
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:24,602
Lord of Thunder.

690
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:50,628
Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.

691
00:52:50,796 --> 00:52:51,916
Okay, this is it.

692
00:52:52,089 --> 00:52:54,919
Let's get ready to welcome this guy.
Here he comes.

693
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:05,311
He is a creature.

694
00:53:05,477 --> 00:53:07,187
What can we say about him?

695
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:09,234
Well, he's unique.
There's none like him.

696
00:53:09,398 --> 00:53:12,148
I feel a special connection with him.

697
00:53:13,694 --> 00:53:14,944
He's undefeated.

698
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:17,950
He's the reigning.

699
00:53:20,325 --> 00:53:22,485
He's the defending.

700
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:24,041
Ladies and gentlemen...

701
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:25,254
I give you...

702
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:33,960
Your Incredible...

703
00:53:37,718 --> 00:53:39,428
Hulk!

704
00:53:40,179 --> 00:53:41,509
Yes!

705
00:53:45,434 --> 00:53:47,394
I have to get off this planet.

706
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,900
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?

707
00:53:57,988 --> 00:53:59,278
Hey!

708
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,240
We know each other.

709
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,700
He's a friend from work.

710
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:14,298
Where have you been?

711
00:54:14,463 --> 00:54:16,593
Everybody thought you were dead.

712
00:54:16,757 --> 00:54:18,757
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.

713
00:54:19,551 --> 00:54:20,971
I lost my hammer.

714
00:54:21,136 --> 00:54:24,176
Like, yesterday,
so that's still pretty fresh.

715
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:26,678
Loki. Loki's alive. Can you believe it?

716
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:27,930
He's up there.

717
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:30,151
Loki! Look who it is!

718
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:34,442
Banner,
I never thought I would say this,

719
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:36,858
but I'm happy to see you.

720
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:39,527
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

721
00:54:45,494 --> 00:54:46,494
Banner.

722
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:48,834
Hey, Banner!

723
00:54:49,248 --> 00:54:51,368
No Banner. Only Hulk.

724
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,250
What are you doing?

725
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:54,918
It's me. It's Thor!

726
00:55:15,107 --> 00:55:16,397
Banner, we're friends.

727
00:55:16,567 --> 00:55:18,127
This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you!

728
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:27,490
Here we go.

729
00:55:46,346 --> 00:55:47,466
What?

730
00:55:57,941 --> 00:55:59,441
Hey, big guy.

731
00:56:01,278 --> 00:56:03,318
The sun's getting real low.

732
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:16,921
That's it.
The sun's going down.

733
00:56:19,671 --> 00:56:21,631
I won't hurt you anymore.

734
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:23,338
No one will.

735
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:36,145
Yes!

736
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,360
That's how it feels!

737
00:56:38,774 --> 00:56:40,614
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.

738
00:56:48,325 --> 00:56:50,745
All right. Screw it.

739
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:04,671
I know you're in there, Banner.
I'll get you out!

740
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:15,934
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!

741
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:17,271
I told them we were friends!

742
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:51,526
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

743
00:58:53,325 --> 00:58:58,205
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

744
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:32,488
Another day, another Doug.

745
00:59:41,373 --> 00:59:43,673
What is that noise?

746
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:46,594
The common folk aren't exactly
falling in line.

747
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:50,553
There's a resistance trying to knock down
the front gates.

748
00:59:56,096 --> 00:59:57,966
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

749
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,680
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...

750
01:00:00,851 --> 01:00:04,731
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there.
What I meant was,

751
01:00:04,897 --> 01:00:06,517
what's your ambition?

752
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:11,069
I just want a chance to prove myself.

753
01:00:11,653 --> 01:00:12,783
Recognition.

754
01:00:12,946 --> 01:00:14,316
When I was young,

755
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:18,119
every great king had an executioner.

756
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:20,335
Not just to execute people,

757
01:00:20,495 --> 01:00:23,075
but also to execute their vision.

758
01:00:24,124 --> 01:00:26,924
But mainly to execute people.

759
01:00:27,085 --> 01:00:29,085
Still, it was a great honor.

760
01:00:30,923 --> 01:00:33,723
I was Odin's executioner.

761
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:39,061
And you shall be my executioner.

762
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,520
Let's begin our conquest.

763
01:00:57,908 --> 01:00:59,528
Skurge, where's the sword?

764
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:08,668
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.

765
01:01:09,044 --> 01:01:12,634
Those people you mentioned,
the ones who aren't falling into line...

766
01:01:13,298 --> 01:01:14,508
Round them up.

767
01:01:38,198 --> 01:01:39,198
Excuse me.

768
01:01:51,712 --> 01:01:54,712
Sorry about that.
These bloody things are everywhere.

769
01:01:55,924 --> 01:01:57,014
Come on.

770
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,630
You'll be safe here.

771
01:03:43,198 --> 01:03:44,198
Are we cool?

772
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:49,540
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

773
01:03:50,831 --> 01:03:52,421
So how long
have you been like that?

774
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:54,133
Like what?

775
01:03:54,877 --> 01:03:58,047
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.

776
01:03:59,173 --> 01:04:01,343
Hulk always Hulk.

777
01:04:05,971 --> 01:04:07,391
How'd you get here?

778
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:09,222
Winning.

779
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:11,057
You mean cheating?

780
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:13,436
Were they wearing one of these
when you won?

781
01:04:13,604 --> 01:04:14,904
How'd you arrive here?

782
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:18,981
Quinjet.

783
01:04:19,067 --> 01:04:21,647
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?

784
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:28,366
That's naked.

785
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:30,245
He's very naked.

786
01:04:33,999 --> 01:04:36,169
It's in my brain now.

787
01:04:36,793 --> 01:04:38,043
Quinjet.

788
01:04:48,514 --> 01:04:49,894
Yes!

789
01:04:50,057 --> 01:04:51,557
I'm getting us out of here.

790
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:54,135
This terrible, awful place.

791
01:04:54,311 --> 01:04:58,021
You're gonna love Asgard.
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.

792
01:04:58,190 --> 01:04:59,570
Hulk stay.

793
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:03,153
No, no, no. My people need me
to get back to Asgard.

794
01:05:03,862 --> 01:05:05,662
We must prevent Ragnarok.

795
01:05:05,822 --> 01:05:06,992
Ragnarok?

796
01:05:07,157 --> 01:05:10,537
The prophesied death of my home world.
The end of days, it's the end of...

797
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:14,749
If you help me get back to Asgard,

798
01:05:14,915 --> 01:05:17,085
I can help you get back to Earth.

799
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:18,251
Earth hate Hulk.

800
01:05:18,418 --> 01:05:19,998
Earth loves Hulk. They love you.

801
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:22,880
You're one of the Avengers.
One of the team, one of our friends.

802
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:25,443
This is what friends do.
They support each other.

803
01:05:25,467 --> 01:05:26,627
You're Banner's friend.

804
01:05:26,802 --> 01:05:29,012
I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.

805
01:05:29,179 --> 01:05:30,179
Banner's friend.

806
01:05:30,264 --> 01:05:31,314
I don't even like Banner.

807
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:34,270
"I'm into numbers and science
and stuff."

808
01:05:34,685 --> 01:05:36,395
Thor go. Hulk stay.

809
01:05:36,562 --> 01:05:37,562
Fine.

810
01:05:38,272 --> 01:05:39,402
Stay here.

811
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:42,484
Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way.

812
01:05:42,651 --> 01:05:46,111
The red, the white. Just pick a color.
Ridiculous.

813
01:05:46,905 --> 01:05:48,155
Smash you.

814
01:05:48,323 --> 01:05:50,623
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.

815
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:52,914
- I smashed you.
- Yeah, sure, sure.

816
01:05:53,078 --> 01:05:54,828
- Baby arms.
- What?

817
01:05:54,997 --> 01:05:55,997
Baby.

818
01:05:56,248 --> 01:05:57,788
Moron! You big child.

819
01:05:57,958 --> 01:05:58,958
Thor go!

820
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:00,292
I am going.

821
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:06,467
Thor go again.

822
01:06:11,138 --> 01:06:12,428
Thor home.

823
01:06:22,566 --> 01:06:24,146
Hulk trains.

824
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:26,398
That's great. Have fun.

825
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:28,200
- Hey, big guy.
- Angry girl.

826
01:06:28,363 --> 01:06:29,663
What have you been up to?

827
01:06:29,823 --> 01:06:30,823
Winning.

828
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:44,420
Heimdall, I know you can see me.

829
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:47,756
I need you to help me.

830
01:06:49,885 --> 01:06:51,225
Help me see.

831
01:07:01,396 --> 01:07:03,896
I see you, but you're far away.

832
01:07:04,816 --> 01:07:06,066
What's going on here?

833
01:07:06,235 --> 01:07:07,615
Come see for yourself.

834
01:07:10,322 --> 01:07:13,122
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold
built by our ancestors.

835
01:07:13,283 --> 01:07:16,703
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.

836
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:18,910
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?

837
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,130
We won't last long if we stay.

838
01:07:24,628 --> 01:07:27,298
She draws her power from Asgard
and grows stronger every day.

839
01:07:27,464 --> 01:07:28,594
Come on.

840
01:07:32,553 --> 01:07:34,053
Hela is ravenous.

841
01:07:34,221 --> 01:07:37,271
If I let her leave, she'll consume
Nine Realms and all the cosmos.

842
01:07:37,474 --> 01:07:38,484
We need you.

843
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:41,042
I'm working on it. But I don't even know
where the hell I am.

844
01:07:41,186 --> 01:07:43,467
You're on a planet surrounded
by doorways. Go through one.

845
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:45,442
- Which one?
- The big one.

846
01:08:14,595 --> 01:08:15,895
Thor sad.

847
01:08:16,054 --> 01:08:17,264
Shut up.

848
01:08:19,516 --> 01:08:21,176
Thor sad.

849
01:08:22,227 --> 01:08:24,017
I'm not sad, you idiot.

850
01:08:24,438 --> 01:08:25,688
I'm pissed off!

851
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:29,779
Angry. I lost my father.

852
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:32,244
I lost my hammer.

853
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:36,275
- Whining and crying. Cry like baby.
- You're not even listening.

854
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,280
Don't kick stuff.

855
01:08:39,578 --> 01:08:41,748
You're being a really bad friend.

856
01:08:41,914 --> 01:08:43,124
You bad friend!

857
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:44,610
- You know what we call you?
- No.

858
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,456
We call you the stupid Avenger.

859
01:08:46,627 --> 01:08:48,547
You're tiny Avenger!

860
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:52,416
What, are you crazy?

861
01:08:52,591 --> 01:08:53,591
Yes.

862
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:56,215
You know what? Earth does hate you.

863
01:09:16,823 --> 01:09:17,873
No.

864
01:09:21,286 --> 01:09:23,956
I'm sorry I said those things.

865
01:09:24,706 --> 01:09:28,336
You're not the stupid Avenger.
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.

866
01:09:28,919 --> 01:09:30,379
It's okay.

867
01:09:30,546 --> 01:09:33,107
You just can't go around throwing shields
at people. Could have killed me.

868
01:09:33,131 --> 01:09:35,841
I know. I'm sorry.
I just get so angry all the time.

869
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:38,139
Hulk always, always angry.

870
01:09:38,303 --> 01:09:40,643
I know.
We're the same, you and I.

871
01:09:41,139 --> 01:09:42,739
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.

872
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:46,851
Yeah, same.
Hulk like fire, Thor like water.

873
01:09:47,771 --> 01:09:49,481
We're kind of both like fire.

874
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:51,648
But Hulk like real fire.

875
01:09:52,693 --> 01:09:55,033
Hulk like raging fire.

876
01:09:55,195 --> 01:09:57,445
Thor like smoldering fire.

877
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,790
Hulk, I need you to do something for me.

878
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:09,875
Angry girl.

879
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:19,467
What's going on? What are you...

880
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,360
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell

881
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:33,501
when someone's hiding all the way across
the universe and wants to be left alone?

882
01:10:33,525 --> 01:10:36,145
- We need to talk.
- No, you wanna talk to me.

883
01:10:36,904 --> 01:10:37,954
I need her to stay.

884
01:10:38,113 --> 01:10:39,113
Stay?

885
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:40,870
Block.

886
01:10:42,534 --> 01:10:43,544
Stay.

887
01:10:44,244 --> 01:10:46,084
- Please.
- Please.

888
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:49,957
All right.

889
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,800
Here's the deal.

890
01:10:54,379 --> 01:10:56,089
I'll listen to you

891
01:10:56,798 --> 01:10:58,168
till this is empty.

892
01:10:59,635 --> 01:11:01,895
Asgard is in danger and
people are dying.

893
01:11:02,054 --> 01:11:03,774
We need to get back there.
I need your help.

894
01:11:05,682 --> 01:11:07,602
Finished. Bye.

895
01:11:09,228 --> 01:11:10,598
Odin is dead.

896
01:11:13,982 --> 01:11:16,232
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.

897
01:11:17,027 --> 01:11:19,607
If Hela's back,
then Asgard's already lost.

898
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,280
I'm going to stop her.

899
01:11:22,032 --> 01:11:23,122
- Alone?
- Nope.

900
01:11:23,283 --> 01:11:24,663
I'm putting together a team.

901
01:11:24,826 --> 01:11:27,576
It's me, you, and the big guy.

902
01:11:27,955 --> 01:11:30,175
No. No team. Only Hulk.

903
01:11:30,332 --> 01:11:32,002
It's me and you.

904
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:33,287
I think it's only you.

905
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:35,670
Please, listen.
The Valkyrie are legend.

906
01:11:35,838 --> 01:11:38,298
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.

907
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:41,729
I'm not getting dragged into
another one of Odin's family squabbles.

908
01:11:41,885 --> 01:11:43,685
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your sister.

909
01:11:43,804 --> 01:11:45,724
Her power comes from Asgard,
same as yours.

910
01:11:45,889 --> 01:11:48,535
When it grew beyond Odin's control
she massacred everyone in the palace

911
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:50,059
and tried to seize the throne.

912
01:11:50,477 --> 01:11:52,187
When she tried
to escape her banishment

913
01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:54,734
he sent the Valkyrie in
to fight her back.

914
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:58,029
I only survived because...

915
01:11:59,611 --> 01:12:02,991
Look, I already faced her once
back when I believed in the throne,

916
01:12:03,156 --> 01:12:04,406
and it cost me everything.

917
01:12:04,783 --> 01:12:06,533
That's what's wrong with Asgard.

918
01:12:06,702 --> 01:12:08,752
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.

919
01:12:08,912 --> 01:12:10,212
I agree.

920
01:12:11,123 --> 01:12:12,543
Don't get familiar.

921
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,380
I agree.

922
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:16,043
That's why I turned down the throne.

923
01:12:16,211 --> 01:12:19,341
But this isn't about the crown.
This is about the people.

924
01:12:19,506 --> 01:12:21,506
They're dying
and they're your people, too.

925
01:12:21,675 --> 01:12:22,675
Forget it.

926
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:25,349
I have.

927
01:12:25,512 --> 01:12:26,722
- Okay.
- Okay.

928
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:28,099
- Good. Great.
- Great.

929
01:12:28,265 --> 01:12:29,275
Thank you.

930
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:31,019
- For what?
- For this.

931
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:34,563
Didn't see that, did you?

932
01:12:36,064 --> 01:12:38,194
There... That's better.

933
01:12:39,943 --> 01:12:41,703
You know, go ahead.

934
01:12:41,862 --> 01:12:46,372
Stay here and enslave people
for that lunatic.

935
01:12:46,533 --> 01:12:47,913
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

936
01:12:48,076 --> 01:12:49,286
But me...

937
01:12:51,371 --> 01:12:54,501
I choose to run toward my problems
and not away from them.

938
01:12:55,584 --> 01:12:56,844
Because that's what...

939
01:13:01,882 --> 01:13:04,012
Because that's what heroes do.

940
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:16,899
Friend stay!

941
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:30,239
Yes!

942
01:13:44,883 --> 01:13:45,883
All right.

943
01:13:49,763 --> 01:13:50,763
Come on.

01:13:53,225 --> 01:13:55,645

957
01:14:15,497 --> 01:14:17,707
Welcome, Point Break.

958
01:14:19,877 --> 01:14:21,247
Friend stay!

959
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:22,420
No, no, no!

960
01:14:22,504 --> 01:14:23,554
Stop!

961
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:24,630
Stay!

962
01:14:25,549 --> 01:14:26,929
Hulk, stop breaking everything!

963
01:14:27,092 --> 01:14:28,592
Don't go!

964
01:14:31,889 --> 01:14:33,179
Nice work, big guy.

965
01:14:33,348 --> 01:14:36,808
We don't know where Ultron's headed,
but you're going very high, very fast.

966
01:14:36,977 --> 01:14:38,777
So, I need you to turn this bird around,
okay?

967
01:14:39,396 --> 01:14:41,936
We can't track you in stealth mode,

968
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:43,817
so I need you to help me out. Okay?

969
01:14:47,487 --> 01:14:49,027
I need you to...

970
01:15:05,255 --> 01:15:07,755
No! No, Banner!

971
01:15:14,932 --> 01:15:16,272
Oh, jeez.

972
01:15:17,184 --> 01:15:18,644
Banner.

973
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:21,351
Hey, hey, hey.

974
01:15:21,522 --> 01:15:23,112
You all right, Banner?

975
01:15:25,526 --> 01:15:27,396
Sun's going down. Sun's going down.

976
01:15:27,819 --> 01:15:29,239
That's it, breathe.

977
01:15:30,447 --> 01:15:31,867
I won't hurt you.

978
01:15:32,449 --> 01:15:33,529
Sun's going down.

979
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,120
- Thor.
- Yeah.

980
01:15:35,953 --> 01:15:37,333
What happened to your hair?

981
01:15:37,496 --> 01:15:38,826
Some creepy old man cut it off.

982
01:15:38,997 --> 01:15:40,457
- It looks good.
- Thanks.

983
01:15:40,624 --> 01:15:42,964
Where are we? How's Nat?

984
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:46,086
- Nat is good, I'm sure.
- Is she okay?

985
01:15:46,296 --> 01:15:48,046
- And what about Sokovia?
- Sokovia?

986
01:15:48,215 --> 01:15:49,725
The city, Sokovia. Did we save it?

987
01:15:49,883 --> 01:15:51,053
- Banner, listen.
- What?

988
01:15:51,218 --> 01:15:53,218
Sokovia. Ultron. That was two years ago.

989
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:54,887
What are you saying?

990
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:56,175
What?

991
01:15:56,974 --> 01:15:58,394
I've been Hulk for two years?

992
01:15:58,725 --> 01:16:00,225
I'm afraid so.

993
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:07,401
What the hell happened?

994
01:16:10,821 --> 01:16:12,491
Banner, there's something
you should know.

995
01:16:14,867 --> 01:16:15,947
Voice activation required.

996
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:17,118
Banner.

997
01:16:17,286 --> 01:16:18,826
Welcome, strongest Avenger.

998
01:16:18,996 --> 01:16:19,996
What?

999
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,120
Ship's log.

1000
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:34,141
Thor, where are we?

1001
01:16:34,303 --> 01:16:35,353
Yeah, about that.

1002
01:16:35,512 --> 01:16:38,642
Sakaar, hear ye.
Attention please. I have some bad news.

1003
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:41,597
My beloved exalted champion
has turned up missing.

1004
01:16:41,768 --> 01:16:44,188
Take to the streets.
Celebrate my champion.

1005
01:16:44,354 --> 01:16:45,364
Who's that?

1006
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,069
He kind of runs the place.

1007
01:16:47,774 --> 01:16:49,252
You actually lived at his house
for awhile.

1008
01:16:49,276 --> 01:16:50,316
- I did?
- Yeah.

1009
01:16:50,485 --> 01:16:52,645
Quite a lot's happened.
You and I had a fight recently.

1010
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:54,993
- Did I win?
- No, I won. Easily.

1011
01:16:55,157 --> 01:16:56,157
Doesn't sound right.

1012
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:57,281
Well, it's true.

1013
01:16:57,367 --> 01:17:02,037
It seems that that criminally seductive
Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.

1014
01:17:02,206 --> 01:17:04,706
Seductive God of Thunder.
We need to move.

1015
01:17:05,459 --> 01:17:06,459
Oh, no.

1016
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:09,457
This is bad.

1017
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:11,670
This is really, really bad.

1018
01:17:14,384 --> 01:17:18,104
Thor, I think I'm freaking out.

1019
01:17:18,555 --> 01:17:19,555
No, no, no.

1020
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,560
Don't freak out. You're okay.
Put these on.

1021
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:22,765
These are Tony's clothes.

1022
01:17:22,935 --> 01:17:24,235
- I know, come on.
- Is he here?

1023
01:17:24,394 --> 01:17:26,414
No, he's not here.
But listen. Just stay calm, okay?

1024
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:29,818
The sun's going down. The sun's getting
really low. Sun's going down.

1025
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,277
I'm upset!

1026
01:17:42,287 --> 01:17:44,157
I'm very upset.

1027
01:17:44,331 --> 01:17:46,421
You know what I like about being upset?
The blame.

1028
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:49,963
Right now, that's the mindset that I'm in.
And you know who I'm blaming?

1029
01:17:50,128 --> 01:17:51,668
- Grandmaster, I can...
- Hey!

1030
01:17:51,839 --> 01:17:52,879
Don't interrupt me!

1031
01:17:52,965 --> 01:17:54,055
Here you go.

1032
01:17:54,758 --> 01:17:56,238
Why are you handing me
the melt stick?

1033
01:17:56,343 --> 01:17:58,183
He was interrupting.

1034
01:17:58,345 --> 01:18:00,095
That's not a capital violation.

1035
01:18:00,264 --> 01:18:01,644
Where was I?

1036
01:18:02,015 --> 01:18:04,475
My precious champion
has come up missing,

1037
01:18:04,643 --> 01:18:07,903
and it's all because of that
Lord of Thunder. It's all because of him.

1038
01:18:08,063 --> 01:18:09,063
Your brother.

1039
01:18:09,147 --> 01:18:12,067
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated, or you know.

1040
01:18:12,234 --> 01:18:13,378
I'm sure there's a big history.

1041
01:18:13,402 --> 01:18:14,572
And your contender...

1042
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:16,362
My dear friend,

1043
01:18:16,530 --> 01:18:19,820
if you were to give me 12 hours, I could
bring them both back to you. Alive.

1044
01:18:19,992 --> 01:18:21,492
I could do it in two.

1045
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:23,449
I could do it in one.

1046
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:24,660
Let's stop there.

1047
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:28,500
You know what? I woke up this morning
thinking about a public execution.

1048
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:30,728
But for now,
I'll settle for this sweet little

1049
01:18:30,752 --> 01:18:33,552
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1050
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:37,128
So, you're on the clock.

1051
01:18:39,052 --> 01:18:40,142
What have you done?

1052
01:18:40,304 --> 01:18:41,554
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1053
01:18:41,722 --> 01:18:42,722
It's Loki.

1054
01:18:42,806 --> 01:18:44,466
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.

1055
01:18:47,561 --> 01:18:50,481
Why would you help my brother escape
with that green fool?

1056
01:18:50,647 --> 01:18:52,017
I don't help anyone.

1057
01:18:58,530 --> 01:18:59,660
You're a Valkyrie.

1058
01:19:04,578 --> 01:19:06,788
I thought the Valkyrie had all died
gruesome deaths.

1059
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:09,666
Choose your next words wisely.

1060
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:13,133
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.

1061
01:20:05,764 --> 01:20:08,354
The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.

1062
01:20:09,518 --> 01:20:11,162
The sun's going down.
It's getting real low.

1063
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:12,436
Oh, shoot.

1064
01:20:12,604 --> 01:20:14,734
- Sun's getting low.
- Would you stop saying that?

1065
01:20:14,898 --> 01:20:16,068
I just need you to stay calm.

1066
01:20:16,233 --> 01:20:18,153
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1067
01:20:18,318 --> 01:20:20,213
It's just a planet.
You've been on a planet before.

1068
01:20:20,237 --> 01:20:21,277
Yeah. One.

1069
01:20:21,446 --> 01:20:23,166
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

1070
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,450
It's a new experience.

1071
01:20:24,616 --> 01:20:28,696
My neurons, they're firing faster
than my brain can handle the information.

1072
01:20:28,871 --> 01:20:31,121
The whole thing
is totally different this time.

1073
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:34,580
In the past, I always felt like Hulk
and I each had a hand on the wheel.

1074
01:20:34,751 --> 01:20:38,171
But this time, it's like he had the keys
to the car and I was locked in the trunk.

1075
01:20:38,338 --> 01:20:40,316
All right, well, you're back now.
That's all that matters.

1076
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,420
No, it's not what matters.

1077
01:20:41,592 --> 01:20:44,342
What I'm trying to tell you, is that
if I turn into the Hulk again,

1078
01:20:44,511 --> 01:20:46,011
Banner may never come back.

1079
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:49,470
And we're stranded on a planet
that is designed to stress me out.

1080
01:20:49,641 --> 01:20:52,191
We're not stranded. I'm gonna figure out
a way to get us home.

1081
01:20:52,644 --> 01:20:53,654
Thank you.

1082
01:20:53,729 --> 01:20:55,939
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.

1083
01:20:56,106 --> 01:20:57,146
What?

1084
01:20:57,316 --> 01:20:59,106
Listen, my people are in great danger.

1085
01:20:59,526 --> 01:21:01,776
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being,

1086
01:21:01,945 --> 01:21:03,775
who also happens to be my sister.

1087
01:21:03,947 --> 01:21:05,657
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...

1088
01:21:05,824 --> 01:21:08,334
I don't wanna fight your sister.
That's a family issue.

1089
01:21:08,493 --> 01:21:09,873
No, she's an evil being.

1090
01:21:10,037 --> 01:21:11,407
I don't care what she is.

1091
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,920
I'm not fighting any more beings.
I'm sick of it.

1092
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:15,172
- What?
- I just told you.

1093
01:21:15,334 --> 01:21:18,134
If I turn into the Hulk,
I am never gonna come back again.

1094
01:21:18,295 --> 01:21:19,345
And you don't care.

1095
01:21:19,505 --> 01:21:21,305
No, no. I'm putting together the team.

1096
01:21:21,465 --> 01:21:22,805
The Hulk is the fire.

1097
01:21:22,966 --> 01:21:24,766
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.

1098
01:21:24,885 --> 01:21:26,435
- What? No!
- It's gross.

1099
01:21:26,595 --> 01:21:28,395
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

1100
01:21:28,514 --> 01:21:31,604
No! I don't even like the Hulk.
He's all like...

1101
01:21:31,767 --> 01:21:33,267
"Smash, smash, smash."

1102
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:34,635
I prefer you.

1103
01:21:35,687 --> 01:21:36,687
Thanks.

1104
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:40,279
But if I'm being honest,
when it comes to fighting evil beings,

1105
01:21:40,442 --> 01:21:41,862
he is very powerful and useful.

1106
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:43,987
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.

1107
01:21:44,154 --> 01:21:45,284
Is he though?

1108
01:21:45,447 --> 01:21:47,567
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.

1109
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:49,661
How many PhDs does Banner have?
Seven.

1110
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:52,410
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.

1111
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:54,539
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

1112
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:59,620
What are you doing with that?

1113
01:21:59,711 --> 01:22:00,772
I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.

1114
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:02,626
- I need a disguise.
- You are the disguise.

1115
01:22:03,298 --> 01:22:05,008
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?

1116
01:22:05,175 --> 01:22:06,925
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1117
01:22:07,094 --> 01:22:09,554
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1118
01:22:09,721 --> 01:22:11,157
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?

1119
01:22:11,181 --> 01:22:12,181
Because you were naked.

1120
01:22:12,349 --> 01:22:13,729
Okay, I'll give you that.

1121
01:22:14,393 --> 01:22:15,662
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!

1122
01:22:15,686 --> 01:22:17,146
Tony wears his pants super tight.

1123
01:22:17,312 --> 01:22:18,362
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.

1124
01:22:18,438 --> 01:22:20,568
- Why are you being so weird?
- I don't know.

1125
01:22:20,732 --> 01:22:23,072
Maybe the fact that I was trapped
for two years

1126
01:22:23,235 --> 01:22:25,825
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.

1127
01:22:25,988 --> 01:22:27,658
Hey. It's okay.

1128
01:22:27,823 --> 01:22:30,203
You're good. Calm down. Come on.

1129
01:22:30,367 --> 01:22:31,827
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard

1130
01:22:31,994 --> 01:22:34,514
and you're not gonna have to think about
the Hulk ever again. All right?

1131
01:22:34,538 --> 01:22:35,538
All right.

1132
01:22:43,338 --> 01:22:44,708
This is bad.

1133
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,180
Banner! Banner!

1134
01:22:54,183 --> 01:22:55,313
Banner!

1135
01:23:09,031 --> 01:23:10,071
Banner!

1136
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:11,700
Thor!

1137
01:23:23,253 --> 01:23:24,253
Hi.

1138
01:23:24,338 --> 01:23:25,338
Hi.

1139
01:23:25,422 --> 01:23:26,632
I was gonna do that.

1140
01:23:26,798 --> 01:23:28,088
Yeah, well, I did it first.

1141
01:23:28,258 --> 01:23:30,258
That's good. What are you doing here?

1142
01:23:31,136 --> 01:23:32,906
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.

1143
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:33,930
I got sidetracked.

1144
01:23:34,473 --> 01:23:35,643
What's with the...

1145
01:23:35,807 --> 01:23:37,057
It's my disguise.

1146
01:23:37,226 --> 01:23:38,306
But I can see your face.

1147
01:23:38,644 --> 01:23:40,404
Not when I do this, you can't.

1148
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:44,481
Your hair looks nice. I like what you did
with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?

1149
01:23:50,447 --> 01:23:53,237
What are those things on her eyes?
Are those people that she's killed?

1150
01:23:53,408 --> 01:23:55,094
She's so beautiful and strong
and courageous.

1151
01:23:55,118 --> 01:23:56,118
Who is this guy?

1152
01:23:56,203 --> 01:23:57,253
- He's a friend.
- Who? Me?

1153
01:23:57,329 --> 01:23:58,809
- I'm Bruce.
- I feel like I know you.

1154
01:23:58,914 --> 01:24:01,124
I feel like I know you, too.

1155
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:08,634
Look, I've spent years in a haze,
trying to forget my past.

1156
01:24:09,424 --> 01:24:13,144
Sakaar seemed like the best place
to drink and forget, and to die one day.

1157
01:24:13,303 --> 01:24:16,603
I was thinking that you drink too much,
and that probably was gonna kill you.

1158
01:24:16,765 --> 01:24:17,965
I don't plan to stop drinking.

1159
01:24:18,767 --> 01:24:20,187
But I don't wanna forget.

1160
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,982
I can't turn away anymore,

1161
01:24:22,604 --> 01:24:24,404
so if I'm gonna die,

1162
01:24:24,565 --> 01:24:27,765
well, it may as well be driving my sword
through the heart of that murderous hag.

1163
01:24:27,901 --> 01:24:29,491
- Good.
- Yeah.

1164
01:24:29,653 --> 01:24:32,663
So, I'm saying
that I wanna be on the team.

1165
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,490
Has it got a name?

1166
01:24:34,658 --> 01:24:37,448
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.

1167
01:24:37,619 --> 01:24:38,619
Revengers?

1168
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:41,287
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.

1169
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:44,381
Do you want revenge?

1170
01:24:45,043 --> 01:24:46,753
I'm undecided.

1171
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:47,920
Okay.

1172
01:24:48,505 --> 01:24:50,335
Also, I've got a peace offering.

1173
01:24:53,594 --> 01:24:55,604
Surprise.

1174
01:25:02,519 --> 01:25:03,979
Just had to be sure.

1175
01:25:07,608 --> 01:25:08,778
Hello, Bruce.

1176
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:13,200
So, last time I saw you,
you were trying to kill everybody.

1177
01:25:13,363 --> 01:25:14,573
Where are you at these days?

1178
01:25:15,032 --> 01:25:16,912
It varies from moment to moment.

1179
01:25:17,993 --> 01:25:19,543
Is that a Dragonfang?

1180
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:20,793
It is.

1181
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:22,124
My God.

1182
01:25:22,998 --> 01:25:25,168
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.

1183
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:28,460
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about as far
apart as any two known systems.

1184
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:31,259
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.

1185
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:35,053
Refuel on Xandar, and
we can be back in Asgard in 18 months.

1186
01:25:35,219 --> 01:25:38,469
Nope. We are going through the big one.

1187
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:39,759
The Devil's Anus?

1188
01:25:39,932 --> 01:25:41,062
Anus?

1189
01:25:41,225 --> 01:25:42,368
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

1190
01:25:42,392 --> 01:25:44,412
For the record, I didn't know
it was called that when I picked it.

1191
01:25:44,436 --> 01:25:46,266
That looks like
a collapsing neutron star

1192
01:25:46,438 --> 01:25:48,898
inside of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1193
01:25:49,066 --> 01:25:51,856
We need another ship.
That will tear mine to pieces.

1194
01:25:51,944 --> 01:25:53,046
She's right. We need one that can

1195
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:55,006
withstand the geodetic strain
from the singularity.

1196
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:56,780
And has an offline
power steering system

1197
01:25:56,949 --> 01:25:59,699
that could also function
without the onboard computer.

1198
01:25:59,868 --> 01:26:02,948
And we need one with cup holders,
because we're gonna die. So, drinks!

1199
01:26:03,121 --> 01:26:05,041
Do I know you? I feel like I know you.

1200
01:26:05,207 --> 01:26:07,077
I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.

1201
01:26:07,251 --> 01:26:08,381
What do you say?

1202
01:26:08,544 --> 01:26:11,064
Uncharted metagalactic travel
through a volatile cosmic gateway.

1203
01:26:11,171 --> 01:26:12,381
Talk about an adventure.

1204
01:26:12,965 --> 01:26:14,635
- We need a ship.
- Need a ship.

1205
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,028
There are one or two ships.
Absolute top of the line models...

1206
01:26:17,052 --> 01:26:18,512
I don't mean to impose...

1207
01:26:21,765 --> 01:26:23,475
But the Grandmaster
has a great many ships.

1208
01:26:24,059 --> 01:26:27,599
I may even have stolen the access codes
to his security system.

1209
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:30,208
And suddenly you're overcome
with an urge to do the right thing.

1210
01:26:30,232 --> 01:26:31,272
Heavens, no.

1211
01:26:31,358 --> 01:26:33,002
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster,

1212
01:26:33,026 --> 01:26:34,986
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship,

1213
01:26:35,153 --> 01:26:38,413
I'm asking for safe passage
through the Anus.

1214
01:26:38,574 --> 01:26:41,164
You're telling us that you can get us
access into the garage

1215
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:43,076
without setting off any alarms?

1216
01:26:43,245 --> 01:26:44,915
Yes, brother. I can.

1217
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,830
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.

1218
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,811
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago

1219
01:26:49,835 --> 01:26:52,345
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.

1220
01:26:52,504 --> 01:26:53,674
He did try to kill me.

1221
01:26:53,839 --> 01:26:55,669
Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.

1222
01:26:55,841 --> 01:26:57,441
There was one time
when we were children,

1223
01:26:57,593 --> 01:27:00,353
he transformed himself into a snake,
and he knows that I love snakes.

1224
01:27:00,512 --> 01:27:02,352
So, I went to pick up the snake
to admire it,

1225
01:27:02,514 --> 01:27:05,275
and he transformed back into himself
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"

1226
01:27:05,392 --> 01:27:08,402
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.

1227
01:27:08,896 --> 01:27:09,976
If we're boosting a ship

1228
01:27:10,147 --> 01:27:11,875
we're gonna need to draw some guards
away from the palace.

1229
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:13,319
Why not set the beast loose?

1230
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,440
Shut up.

1231
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:15,690
You guys have a beast?

1232
01:27:15,861 --> 01:27:18,241
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.

1233
01:27:18,447 --> 01:27:19,947
We're going to start a revolution.

1234
01:27:20,449 --> 01:27:22,029
- Revolution?
- I'll explain later.

1235
01:27:22,201 --> 01:27:24,491
- Who's this guy again?
- I'll explain later.

1236
01:27:25,329 --> 01:27:28,789
Is that some sort of protoplasm,
all the stuff that's coming out of you,

1237
01:27:28,957 --> 01:27:30,247
or are they eggs?

1238
01:27:31,543 --> 01:27:32,793
Looks like eggs.

1239
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:43,599
I'm looking for Korg.

1240
01:27:43,764 --> 01:27:45,064
Who's asking?

1241
01:27:45,224 --> 01:27:46,394
I know you're asking.

1242
01:27:46,558 --> 01:27:48,558
Is there anyone else asking,
or is it just you?

1243
01:27:48,727 --> 01:27:50,937
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.

1244
01:27:54,441 --> 01:27:56,531
The revolution has begun.

1245
01:27:56,777 --> 01:27:58,817
Revolution? How did this happen?

1246
01:27:58,987 --> 01:28:00,487
Don't know.

1247
01:28:00,656 --> 01:28:03,826
But the arena's mainframe for the
Obedience Disks have been deactivated

1248
01:28:03,992 --> 01:28:05,872
and the slaves have armed themselves.

1249
01:28:06,537 --> 01:28:08,117
I don't like that word.

1250
01:28:08,288 --> 01:28:09,578
Which? Mainframe?

1251
01:28:09,748 --> 01:28:11,828
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?

1252
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,040
No, the "S" word.

1253
01:28:14,211 --> 01:28:16,961
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs
have armed themselves.

1254
01:28:18,382 --> 01:28:19,722
Okay, that's better.

1255
01:28:25,722 --> 01:28:27,682
Hey, so, listen. We should talk.

1256
01:28:29,142 --> 01:28:30,192
I disagree.

1257
01:28:30,561 --> 01:28:33,481
Open communication
was never our family's forte.

1258
01:28:33,647 --> 01:28:34,767
You have no idea.

1259
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:37,610
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.

1260
01:28:37,776 --> 01:28:38,776
Hello.

1261
01:28:39,611 --> 01:28:40,611
Hi.

1262
01:28:47,911 --> 01:28:49,541
Odin brought us together.

1263
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:53,170
It's almost poetic that his death
should split us apart.

1264
01:28:59,214 --> 01:29:01,344
We might as well be strangers now.

1265
01:29:01,508 --> 01:29:04,678
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.

1266
01:29:07,681 --> 01:29:09,241
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.

1267
01:29:10,809 --> 01:29:11,809
Here's the thing.

1268
01:29:11,977 --> 01:29:13,817
I'm probably better off staying here
on Sakaar.

1269
01:29:13,937 --> 01:29:15,647
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1270
01:29:17,524 --> 01:29:18,944
Did you just agree with me?

1271
01:29:19,109 --> 01:29:20,689
Come on, this place is perfect for you.

1272
01:29:20,861 --> 01:29:22,531
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...

1273
01:29:22,696 --> 01:29:24,356
Brother, you're gonna do great here.

1274
01:29:24,531 --> 01:29:26,241
Do you truly think so little of me?

1275
01:29:28,327 --> 01:29:30,077
Loki, I thought the world of you.

1276
01:29:31,163 --> 01:29:33,753
I thought we were gonna fight
side by side forever.

1277
01:29:33,916 --> 01:29:36,746
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.

1278
01:29:37,461 --> 01:29:39,921
I don't know,
maybe there's still good in you.

1279
01:29:40,088 --> 01:29:43,588
But let's be honest,
our paths diverged a long time ago.

1280
01:29:48,263 --> 01:29:49,313
Yeah.

1281
01:29:50,474 --> 01:29:52,914
It's probably for the best
that we never see each other again.

1282
01:29:53,018 --> 01:29:54,308
It's what you always wanted.

1283
01:29:58,524 --> 01:30:00,234
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

1284
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:01,650
- What?
- "Get Help."

1285
01:30:01,735 --> 01:30:02,735
No.

1286
01:30:02,819 --> 01:30:03,922
- Come on, you love it.
- I hate it.

1287
01:30:03,946 --> 01:30:05,590
- It's great. It works every time.
- It's humiliating.

1288
01:30:05,614 --> 01:30:06,925
- Do you have a better plan?
- No.

1289
01:30:06,949 --> 01:30:07,949
We're doing it.

1290
01:30:08,116 --> 01:30:09,906
We are not doing "Get Help."

1291
01:30:10,953 --> 01:30:12,203
Get help! Please!

1292
01:30:12,371 --> 01:30:13,411
My brother, he's dying.

1293
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:15,580
Get help! Help him!

1294
01:30:17,626 --> 01:30:18,876
Classic.

1295
01:30:19,253 --> 01:30:20,343
Still hate it.

1296
01:30:20,504 --> 01:30:22,844
- It's humiliating.
- Not for me, it's not.

1297
01:30:23,006 --> 01:30:25,126
Now, which one's the ship
she told us to get?

1298
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:26,300
The Commodore.

1299
01:30:26,969 --> 01:30:27,969
Right.

1300
01:30:30,806 --> 01:30:33,386
Though I feel it won't make
much of a difference.

1301
01:30:35,519 --> 01:30:37,309
Loki.

1302
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:39,958
I know I've betrayed you many times
before,

1303
01:30:39,982 --> 01:30:41,652
but this time
it's truly nothing personal.

1304
01:30:41,817 --> 01:30:44,897
The reward for your capture
will set me up nicely.

1305
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:46,700
Never one for sentiment, were you?

1306
01:30:46,864 --> 01:30:48,324
Easier to let it burn.

1307
01:30:48,657 --> 01:30:49,657
I agree.

1308
01:30:58,125 --> 01:30:59,755
That looks painful.

1309
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:03,300
Dear brother,
you're becoming predictable.

1310
01:31:03,463 --> 01:31:05,473
I trust you, you betray me.

1311
01:31:05,632 --> 01:31:07,682
Round and round in circles we go.

1312
01:31:07,843 --> 01:31:09,843
See, Loki, life is about...
It's about growth.

1313
01:31:10,012 --> 01:31:11,222
It's about change.

1314
01:31:11,388 --> 01:31:14,598
But you seem to
just wanna stay the same.

1315
01:31:15,142 --> 01:31:16,772
I guess what I'm trying to say

1316
01:31:16,935 --> 01:31:19,895
is that you'll always be
the God of Mischief,

1317
01:31:20,063 --> 01:31:21,563
but you could be more.

1318
01:31:24,026 --> 01:31:26,026
I'll just put this over here for you.

1319
01:31:26,195 --> 01:31:29,705
Anyway, all got places to be,
so good luck.

1320
01:31:35,537 --> 01:31:36,907
All right, I can figure this out.

1321
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,040
It's just another spaceship.

1322
01:31:52,262 --> 01:31:53,642
Loyal Sakaarians,

1323
01:31:53,805 --> 01:31:57,345
Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship
and my favorite champion.

1324
01:31:58,769 --> 01:32:01,939
Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.

1325
01:32:02,105 --> 01:32:03,895
Do not let him leave this planet.

1326
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:18,330
- Good shot!
- Thanks.

1327
01:32:21,041 --> 01:32:22,251
Open the doors.

1328
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:23,837
Okay.

1329
01:32:28,966 --> 01:32:30,836
I hope that you're tougher
than you look.

1330
01:32:31,009 --> 01:32:32,049
Why?

1331
01:32:44,523 --> 01:32:46,363
Shouldn't we be shooting back
or something?

1332
01:32:46,525 --> 01:32:47,575
Yes, we should.

1333
01:32:47,651 --> 01:32:49,531
Where are the guns on this ship?

1334
01:32:49,695 --> 01:32:51,075
There aren't any.

1335
01:32:51,238 --> 01:32:52,818
- It's a leisure vessel.
- What?

1336
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:55,830
Grandmaster uses it for his good times,
orgies and stuff.

1337
01:32:55,993 --> 01:32:58,583
Did she just say the Grandmaster
uses it for orgies?

1338
01:32:58,745 --> 01:32:59,945
Yeah.

1339
01:33:00,122 --> 01:33:01,542
Don't touch anything.

1340
01:33:21,852 --> 01:33:22,852
No!

1341
01:33:26,148 --> 01:33:27,188
- No!
- No!

1342
01:33:34,156 --> 01:33:35,236
Get inside!

1343
01:33:35,407 --> 01:33:37,077
In a minute.

1344
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:50,440
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.

1345
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:52,064
No. I don't know
how to fly one of these.

1346
01:33:52,132 --> 01:33:53,842
You're a scientist.
Use one of your PhDs.

1347
01:33:54,009 --> 01:33:57,299
None of them are for flying
alien spaceships!

1348
01:34:31,713 --> 01:34:32,763
Okay, come on.

1349
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,970
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.

1350
01:34:35,133 --> 01:34:36,183
That looks like a gun.

1351
01:34:37,302 --> 01:34:39,932
It's my birthday
It's my birthday

1352
01:34:40,681 --> 01:34:43,101
It's my birthday

1353
01:34:49,773 --> 01:34:51,073
Yeah!

1354
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:10,625
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus!

1355
01:35:17,384 --> 01:35:18,394
There she is.

1356
01:35:18,552 --> 01:35:20,602
Our ticket out of here.

1357
01:35:21,054 --> 01:35:22,354
Hey, what's this?

1358
01:35:27,394 --> 01:35:28,404
Thank you.

1359
01:35:28,478 --> 01:35:30,978
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.

1360
01:35:31,064 --> 01:35:32,074
You wanna come?

1361
01:35:32,566 --> 01:35:36,896
You do seem like you're
in desperate need of leadership.

1362
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:38,610
Why, thank you.

1363
01:35:42,367 --> 01:35:43,447
Here we go.

1364
01:35:50,042 --> 01:35:51,042
Shit.

1365
01:36:08,477 --> 01:36:10,267
Asgardians...

1366
01:36:10,437 --> 01:36:13,017
Some misguided soul

1367
01:36:13,815 --> 01:36:15,775
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

1368
01:36:15,943 --> 01:36:18,323
Tell us where it is

1369
01:36:18,487 --> 01:36:21,107
or there will be consequences.

1370
01:36:25,035 --> 01:36:26,155
Bad ones.

1371
01:36:29,331 --> 01:36:30,331
Well?

1372
01:36:37,422 --> 01:36:38,592
You.

1373
01:37:14,668 --> 01:37:18,878
Well? Executioner?

1374
01:37:23,844 --> 01:37:25,054
Wait!

1375
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:26,220
Wait!

1376
01:37:28,724 --> 01:37:29,854
I know where the sword is.

1377
01:38:12,768 --> 01:38:15,018
I never thought I'd be back here.

1378
01:38:18,607 --> 01:38:20,187
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.

1379
01:38:20,651 --> 01:38:23,651
I mean, not that it's not nice.
It's just, it's on fire.

1380
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:25,060
Here, up here in the mountains.

1381
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,450
Heat signatures.
People clustered together.

1382
01:38:27,658 --> 01:38:28,658
She's coming for them.

1383
01:38:28,825 --> 01:38:30,803
Okay, drop me off at the palace
and I'll draw her away.

1384
01:38:30,827 --> 01:38:32,077
And get yourself killed?

1385
01:38:32,246 --> 01:38:34,140
The people trapped down there
are all that matters.

1386
01:38:34,164 --> 01:38:36,935
While I'm dealing with Hela, I need you
two to help get everyone off Asgard.

1387
01:38:36,959 --> 01:38:38,749
How the hell are we supposed to do that?

1388
01:38:39,253 --> 01:38:40,883
I have a man on the ground.

1389
01:38:46,844 --> 01:38:47,844
Asgard.

1390
01:38:51,265 --> 01:38:52,605
She's here.

1391
01:39:04,152 --> 01:39:05,862
Now the ship has a gun.

1392
01:39:06,029 --> 01:39:07,199
I'll take it from here.

1393
01:39:08,031 --> 01:39:11,161
I found this in the armory.

1394
01:39:14,329 --> 01:39:15,539
Good luck.

1395
01:39:16,999 --> 01:39:18,419
Your Majesty...

1396
01:39:20,377 --> 01:39:21,497
Don't die.

1397
01:39:24,298 --> 01:39:26,088
You know what I mean.

1398
01:40:24,983 --> 01:40:26,903
We must keep moving!

1399
01:40:27,528 --> 01:40:29,318
Go to the Bifrost!

1400
01:41:11,905 --> 01:41:13,275
Sister.

1401
01:41:15,284 --> 01:41:17,084
You're still alive.

1402
01:41:17,244 --> 01:41:20,714
I love what you've done with the place.
Redecorating, I see.

1403
01:41:20,873 --> 01:41:25,423
It seems our father's solution
to every problem was to cover it up.

1404
01:41:27,087 --> 01:41:28,707
Or to cast it out.

1405
01:41:30,966 --> 01:41:34,466
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.

1406
01:41:35,053 --> 01:41:36,433
You see?

1407
01:41:37,097 --> 01:41:39,217
You never knew him.

1408
01:41:39,516 --> 01:41:41,426
Not at his best.

1409
01:41:41,602 --> 01:41:46,152
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations
in blood and tears.

1410
01:41:46,315 --> 01:41:49,235
Where do you think all this gold
came from?

1411
01:41:49,401 --> 01:41:51,151
And then, one day,

1412
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:54,320
he decided to become a benevolent king.

1413
01:41:54,489 --> 01:41:57,119
To foster peace, to protect life.

1414
01:41:58,243 --> 01:41:59,833
To have you.

1415
01:42:00,287 --> 01:42:02,657
I understand why you're angry.

1416
01:42:02,831 --> 01:42:06,751
And you are my sister, and technically
have a claim to the throne.

1417
01:42:06,919 --> 01:42:08,897
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.

1418
01:42:08,921 --> 01:42:10,131
But it can't be you.

1419
01:42:10,297 --> 01:42:13,967
You're just the worst.

1420
01:42:15,427 --> 01:42:17,217
Okay, get up.

1421
01:42:17,387 --> 01:42:19,427
You're in my seat.

1422
01:42:20,390 --> 01:42:22,390
You know, Father once told me

1423
01:42:22,559 --> 01:42:25,099
that a wise king never seeks out war.

1424
01:42:25,270 --> 01:42:27,810
But must always be ready for it.

1425
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:01,390
Go back!

1426
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:07,850
Go!

1427
01:43:42,764 --> 01:43:45,354
To be honest, I expected more.

1428
01:43:48,353 --> 01:43:49,653
Heimdall!

1429
01:43:51,857 --> 01:43:53,607
The sword!

1430
01:43:58,113 --> 01:43:59,663
Here's the difference between us.

1431
01:43:59,823 --> 01:44:01,413
I'm Odin's firstborn,

1432
01:44:01,575 --> 01:44:03,995
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.

1433
01:44:04,161 --> 01:44:05,911
And you're nothing.

1434
01:44:16,173 --> 01:44:19,053
So simple,
even a blind man could see it.

1435
01:44:22,763 --> 01:44:25,023
Now you remind me of Dad.

1436
01:44:35,317 --> 01:44:37,067
The stupid dog won't die!

1437
01:44:58,882 --> 01:45:01,892
Everything's gonna be all right now.
I got this.

1438
01:45:02,094 --> 01:45:04,184
You wanted to know who I am?

1439
01:45:05,138 --> 01:45:06,768
What the hell are you talking about?

1440
01:45:06,932 --> 01:45:08,352
You'll see!

1441
01:45:57,024 --> 01:45:59,234
You see? No one's going anywhere.

1442
01:45:59,401 --> 01:46:00,781
I'll get that sword,

1443
01:46:00,944 --> 01:46:03,664
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.

1444
01:46:30,307 --> 01:46:31,307
Hey, man.

1445
01:46:32,851 --> 01:46:34,271
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

1446
01:46:34,436 --> 01:46:37,076
We're gonna jump on that spaceship
and get out of here. Wanna come?

1447
01:46:46,615 --> 01:46:50,455
Your savior is here.

1448
01:46:57,668 --> 01:46:59,538
Did you miss me?

1449
01:46:59,711 --> 01:47:01,171
Everyone, on that ship now.

1450
01:47:05,551 --> 01:47:07,721
Welcome home. I saw you coming.

1451
01:47:07,886 --> 01:47:08,966
Of course you did.

1452
01:47:25,654 --> 01:47:27,954
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.

1453
01:47:28,991 --> 01:47:30,031
You see...

1454
01:47:30,826 --> 01:47:33,746
I'm not a queen or a monster.

1455
01:47:35,622 --> 01:47:37,292
I'm the Goddess of Death.

1456
01:47:38,417 --> 01:47:40,787
What were you the god of, again?

1457
01:47:52,139 --> 01:47:54,019
Even when you had two eyes,

1458
01:47:54,725 --> 01:47:56,605
you'd see only half the picture.

1459
01:47:58,187 --> 01:48:01,187
She's too strong.
Without my hammer, I can't.

1460
01:48:02,274 --> 01:48:05,824
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers?

1461
01:48:08,864 --> 01:48:12,584
That hammer was to help you
control your power, to focus it.

1462
01:48:13,368 --> 01:48:15,158
It was never your source of strength.

1463
01:48:15,871 --> 01:48:18,211
It's too late.
She's already taken Asgard.

1464
01:48:19,249 --> 01:48:21,919
Asgard is not a place. Never was.

1465
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:24,460
This could be Asgard.

1466
01:48:25,631 --> 01:48:27,721
Asgard is where our people stand.

1467
01:48:28,717 --> 01:48:33,507
Even now, right now,
those people need your help.

1468
01:48:41,230 --> 01:48:43,360
I'm not as strong as you.

1469
01:48:46,026 --> 01:48:47,066
No...

1470
01:48:48,487 --> 01:48:49,777
You're stronger.

1471
01:48:58,789 --> 01:49:00,169
Tell me, brother.

1472
01:49:00,332 --> 01:49:02,792
What were you the god of, again?

1473
01:51:18,136 --> 01:51:20,346
- You're late.
- You're missing an eye.

1474
01:51:20,514 --> 01:51:22,024
This isn't over.

1475
01:51:29,147 --> 01:51:30,857
I think we should disband the Revengers.

1476
01:51:32,442 --> 01:51:33,682
Hit her with a lightning blast.

1477
01:51:33,735 --> 01:51:36,172
I just hit her with the biggest lightning
blast in the history of lightning.

1478
01:51:36,196 --> 01:51:37,196
It did nothing.

1479
01:51:41,201 --> 01:51:43,831
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.

1480
01:51:44,454 --> 01:51:45,914
It won't end there.

1481
01:51:46,081 --> 01:51:49,501
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.

1482
01:51:49,668 --> 01:51:51,378
She'll hunt us down.

1483
01:51:51,545 --> 01:51:53,095
We need to stop her here and now.

1484
01:51:53,255 --> 01:51:54,465
So what do we do?

1485
01:51:55,215 --> 01:51:56,795
I'm not doing "Get Help."

1486
01:52:08,937 --> 01:52:12,227
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.

1487
01:52:14,359 --> 01:52:15,399
Loki,

1488
01:52:15,485 --> 01:52:17,445
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.

1489
01:52:17,613 --> 01:52:19,663
This was about causing Ragnarok.

1490
01:52:19,823 --> 01:52:21,453
Surtur's crown, the vault.

1491
01:52:23,035 --> 01:52:24,495
It's the only way.

1492
01:52:24,995 --> 01:52:26,455
Bold move, brother.

1493
01:52:27,748 --> 01:52:29,328
Even for me.

1494
01:52:32,544 --> 01:52:33,594
Shall we?

1495
01:52:34,713 --> 01:52:35,713
After you.

1496
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,740
This is madness.

1497
01:53:16,338 --> 01:53:17,918
Go! Go, now!

1498
01:54:18,942 --> 01:54:20,402
For Asgard.

1499
01:54:34,666 --> 01:54:35,996
Hela!

1500
01:55:00,567 --> 01:55:04,697
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.

1501
01:55:16,250 --> 01:55:17,500
Hela, enough!

1502
01:55:21,171 --> 01:55:24,051
You want Asgard, it's yours.

1503
01:55:24,216 --> 01:55:27,636
Whatever game you're playing,
it won't work.

1504
01:55:27,803 --> 01:55:29,473
You can't defeat me.

1505
01:55:30,097 --> 01:55:31,427
No, I know.

1506
01:55:33,141 --> 01:55:34,181
But he can.

1507
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:39,860
No.

1508
01:55:48,448 --> 01:55:51,868
Tremble before me, Asgard!

1509
01:55:52,035 --> 01:55:54,155
I am your reckoning!

1510
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:04,420
The people are safe.

1511
01:56:05,048 --> 01:56:06,928
That's all that matters.

1512
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:10,100
We're fulfilling the prophecy.

1513
01:56:10,596 --> 01:56:11,966
I hate this prophecy.

1514
01:56:12,139 --> 01:56:13,929
So do I, but we have no choice.

1515
01:56:14,099 --> 01:56:15,889
Surtur destroys Asgard,

1516
01:56:16,059 --> 01:56:18,399
he destroys Hela,
so that our people may live.

1517
01:56:18,562 --> 01:56:21,312
But we need to let him finish the job,
otherwise...

1518
01:56:23,150 --> 01:56:24,150
No!

1519
01:56:26,403 --> 01:56:28,453
Hulk, stop, you moron!

1520
01:56:37,539 --> 01:56:38,579
Hulk, stop.

1521
01:56:38,749 --> 01:56:41,789
Just for once in your life, don't smash.

1522
01:56:42,961 --> 01:56:44,671
Big monster!

1523
01:56:45,005 --> 01:56:46,295
Let's go!

1524
01:56:48,091 --> 01:56:49,091
Fine.

1525
01:57:13,158 --> 01:57:16,038
I am Asgard's doom!

1526
01:57:39,017 --> 01:57:41,097
The damage is not too bad.

1527
01:57:41,270 --> 01:57:43,270
As long as the foundations
are still strong,

1528
01:57:43,438 --> 01:57:45,068
we can rebuild this place.

1529
01:57:45,232 --> 01:57:47,442
It will become a haven

1530
01:57:47,609 --> 01:57:50,569
for all peoples and aliens
of the universe.

1531
01:57:57,619 --> 01:58:00,039
Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.

1532
01:58:14,928 --> 01:58:16,848
What have I done?

1533
01:58:18,015 --> 01:58:20,435
You saved us from extinction.

1534
01:58:20,601 --> 01:58:22,441
Asgard is not a place...

1535
01:58:23,937 --> 01:58:25,807
It's a people.

1536
01:58:54,885 --> 01:58:56,395
It suits you.

1537
01:58:59,139 --> 01:59:01,599
Maybe you're not so bad after all,
brother.

1538
01:59:02,351 --> 01:59:03,391
Maybe not.

1539
01:59:04,603 --> 01:59:05,773
Thank you.

1540
01:59:06,522 --> 01:59:09,022
If you were here,
I might even give you a hug.

1541
01:59:13,111 --> 01:59:14,361
I'm here.

1542
01:59:38,637 --> 01:59:39,967
Your throne.

1543
01:59:55,070 --> 01:59:58,410
So, King of Asgard.

1544
02:00:08,917 --> 02:00:10,037
Where to?

1545
02:00:11,170 --> 02:00:12,590
I'm not sure.

1546
02:00:12,963 --> 02:00:14,263
Any suggestions?

1547
02:00:16,884 --> 02:00:18,844
Miek, where are you from?

1548
02:00:19,011 --> 02:00:20,851
Miek's dead.

1549
02:00:21,013 --> 02:00:24,143
Yeah, no, I accidentally stomped on him
on the bridge.

1550
02:00:24,308 --> 02:00:26,978
I've just felt so guilty,
I've been carrying him around all day.

1551
02:00:29,521 --> 02:00:30,981
Miek, you're alive!

1552
02:00:31,148 --> 02:00:33,478
He's alive, guys.
What was your question again, bro?

1553
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:36,490
Earth it is.

1554
02:02:53,373 --> 02:02:56,083
Do you really think it's a good idea
to go back to Earth?

1555
02:02:56,251 --> 02:02:59,551
Yes, of course. The people of Earth
love me. I'm very popular.

1556
02:03:00,130 --> 02:03:02,050
Let me rephrase that.

1557
02:03:02,216 --> 02:03:05,426
Do you really think it's a good idea
to bring me back to Earth?

1558
02:03:05,969 --> 02:03:08,009
Probably not, to be honest.

1559
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:13,100
I wouldn't worry, brother. I feel like
everything's gonna work out fine.

1560
02:09:42,032 --> 02:09:43,032
Oh, boy.

1561
02:09:51,458 --> 02:09:55,588
I just gotta say, I'm proud of you all.

1562
02:09:55,754 --> 02:09:59,174
This revolution has been
a huge success. Yay, us!

1563
02:09:59,341 --> 02:10:01,801
Pat on the back.
Pat on the back.

1564
02:10:01,969 --> 02:10:04,349
Come on. No?

1565
02:10:04,596 --> 02:10:06,636
Me too.
'Cause I've been a big part of it.

1566
02:10:06,807 --> 02:10:09,597
Can't have a revolution
without somebody to overthrow.

1567
02:10:09,768 --> 02:10:11,808
So, you're welcome.

1568
02:10:11,979 --> 02:10:14,309
And it's a tie.
