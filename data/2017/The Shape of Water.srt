00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,210
<i>If I spoke about it...</i>

3
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:53,781
<i>If I did...</i>

4
00:01:54,613 --> 00:01:57,048
<i>what would I tell you?</i>

5
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,418
<i>I wonder.</i>

6
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:02,921
<i>Would I tell you
about the time?</i>

7
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,656
<i>It happened a long time ago,
it seems...</i>

8
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,861
<i>in the last days
of a fair prince's reign.</i>

9
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,866
<i>Or would I tell you
about the place?</i>

10
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:16,501
<i>A small city near the coast...</i>

11
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,872
<i>but far from everything else.</i>

12
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,177
<i>Or, I don't know.</i>

13
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,681
<i>Would I tell you about her?</i>

14
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,218
<i>The princess without voice.</i>

15
00:02:33,552 --> 00:02:35,687
<i>Or perhaps
I would just warn you</i>

16
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,658
<i>about the truth
of these facts...</i>

17
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,128
<i>and the tale
of love and loss...</i>

18
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:47,701
<i>and the monster who tried
to destroy it all.</i>

19
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,753
<i>My Lord Hedak.</i>

20
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:46,491
<i>So, you are troubled.
Tell me.</i>

21
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:51,028
<i>I've...</i>

22
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,831
<i>I have sinned.
I've offended the god.</i>

23
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,766
<i>I am deep in sin,
my Lord Hedak.</i>

24
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:58,336
<i>Let me judge of that.</i>

25
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,942
<i>I've doubted the ceremony
of the sacrifice.</i>

26
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,521
<i>I don't want to go up there.</i>

27
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:27,391
<i>Why, everybody's got
to go upstairs, Miss Lloyd,</i>

28
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,894
<i>if they wants to go to bed.</i>

29
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:33,131
The sirens wake you up?
There was a fire.

30
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,035
The chocolate factory.

31
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,702
Do you smell that?

32
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:40,538
Oh, my!

33
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,908
Toasted cocoa.

34
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,679
Tragedy and delight,
hand in hand.

35
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:49,480
Oh, my dear child.

36
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,649
I would waste away if you
weren't here looking after me.

37
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:54,752
I am the proverbial
starving...

38
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,088
Watch this.

39
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,726
It's Bojangles,
the stair dance.

40
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,827
Oh, that's so hard.
Cagney did it.

41
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:05,297
Different, but beautiful.

42
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:08,966
<i>- I wanna do that, too.
- All right!</i>

43
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,434
<i>- Are you ready?
- Yup.</i>

44
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:11,634
<i>Come on.</i>

45
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:14,141
<i>Ah!</i>

46
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,410
<i>Say, you catch on quick.</i>

47
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:20,713
<i>Look out now.
Here's your last one!</i>

48
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:57,014
Elisa!

49
00:06:57,816 --> 00:06:59,783
Next time you come
to bring the rent...

50
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:02,920
I want you to stay
and see the Bible movie, huh!

51
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,521
I have... I have two
free tickets here.

52
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:07,257
You bring your neighbor Giles.
He's a good boy.

53
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:08,728
Bible movie and comedy!

54
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,660
Nobody's coming
to the theater, huh?

55
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:14,098
I'll throw in a free
popcorn and soda!

56
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,065
Oh, no!

57
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,067
For God's sake,
there are two "S's" there!

58
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:21,137
Come on! Two "S."
"Mardi Grass!" "Mardi Grass!"

59
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:22,206
Two "S."

60
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:28,872
<i>All new personnel,
be advised that sector 12</i>

61
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:30,742
<i>has now been cleared
to level A safety.</i>

62
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:34,510
Elisa! Come on.
I'm here already.

63
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:35,778
You gotta learn to be on time.

64
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,448
Hey! What are you doing?
Don't cut in, dummy!

65
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,585
Leave her alone, woman.
I was keeping her place.

66
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,587
I get reported, I come
after you and the mute.

67
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,425
You do that, Yolanda.
You do that.

68
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,806
My feet are already
killing me.

69
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,874
I made Brewster
pigs in a blanket

70
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:06,677
tonight before leaving...

71
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,679
and boy, he just ate 'em up.

72
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:12,216
No "thank-yous",
no "yum-yums".

73
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,051
Not a peep.

74
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,653
Man is as silent as a grave.

75
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:19,089
But if farts were flattery...

76
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,926
honey, he'd be Shakespeare.

77
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,294
Then I get home
and I make him breakfast.

78
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:26,831
Eggs, bacon,
and buttered toast.

79
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,865
I butter
the man's toast, Elisa.

80
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:30,533
Mmm-hmm, both sides....

81
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:31,936
as if he was a child.

82
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,205
And I don't even
get a thank-you.

83
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,307
You'd be grateful

84
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,174
because you're
an educated woman.

85
00:09:38,176 --> 00:09:40,043
But my Brewster,
all he had going for him

86
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:42,245
was animal magnetism
back in the day.

87
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:44,615
Hasn't worked in a while.

88
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,350
What in the Sam Hill? No!

89
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:49,786
You boys mind putting
the trash in the can?

90
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:51,324
That's what it's there for.

91
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,892
Hard to believe, huh?
That's what it's there for.

92
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,527
All right, all right.
Sorry, Zelda! Sorry!

93
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,162
I don't know
what they're doing.

94
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,063
Making a goddamn mess
is what I think.

95
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:02,567
Zelda!
Stop that chatter, please.

96
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:03,734
Yes, sir.

97
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,003
There's no call
for the blasphemy.

98
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,941
Sorry, Mr. Fleming, sir.

99
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:12,308
A moment of your time!

100
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,578
Today, we are receiving
a new team

101
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,779
and asset here in T-4.

102
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:18,115
This is Dr. Robert Hoffstetler

103
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,217
from our sister facility
in Galveston.

104
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:24,422
Now, I don't wanna bolster
or overstate the matter

105
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:28,192
but this may very well be
the most sensitive asset

106
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,028
ever to be housed
in this facility.

107
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:52,081
- How was your trip?
- Fine. Who's security here?

108
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,087
Just one moment, please.

109
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:58,589
Security! Who's security?

110
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,258
Welcome to T-4, sir.

111
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,359
Yes, sir, I am Fleming,
head of Security.

112
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,727
And if there are questions
you have or concerns...

113
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:06,029
you just come talk to me.

114
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,478
Do you understand?
I'll be in charge from now on.

115
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:35,645
Get them out.

116
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:39,730
Help me move this
cylinder into the compressor.

117
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,271
Bring it here.
Bring it here.

118
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:51,408
Bring it over here.
There. Mount the cylinder.

119
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,009
We need to pressurize it
immediately.

120
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:55,482
- From there to there.
- Elisa! Elisa!

121
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,782
Come on!

122
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,950
Lord, what goes on
in this place?

123
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,018
Did you see that?

124
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,505
Yes, I'm wearing
the hairpiece.

125
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:23,440
How does it look?

126
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,078
Oh! Be careful of the car.

127
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,946
And it's not a hairpiece.

128
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,083
It's a toupee. It's French.

129
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,817
<i>It's eternal, see?</i>

130
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,254
Tantalus never achieved
the escape of death....

131
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,956
because the fruit
on the branches

132
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,158
was just always
out of his reach...

133
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,860
and the water
in the stream receded

134
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,662
every time he
stooped down to drink.

135
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:47,398
And so that's why
we say things today like...

136
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,969
"Look at those
tantalizing pies."

137
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,107
Thank you!
Y'all come back now, you hear?

138
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,640
Yes, pies for breakfast.

139
00:12:57,642 --> 00:12:59,211
Just trust me on this.

140
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:03,313
Hey, folks!
Welcome to Dixie Doug's.

141
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,914
I've seen you
in here before, right?

142
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,216
Yes.

143
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,784
I've been here a couple
of times, as a matter of fact.

144
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,119
Partial to key lime pie?

145
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,956
I am, I am.
Two to go.

146
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,124
Just go with it,
please. Please.

147
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:18,596
Uh, I, uh, it's a craving
that I indulge in.

148
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:21,532
Can't possibly be good for me,
but nothing I like is.

149
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:24,234
No, no, it's a mighty
fine pie, key lime.

150
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,369
You wouldn't happen to be

151
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,970
the famous "Dixie Doug"
himself, would you?

152
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,139
Oh, heck no.

153
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,572
The pies are trucked
throughout the country.

154
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:32,176
- They call it "franchising," see?
- Oh.

155
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,110
They give us the spinners,
the signage.

156
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:36,047
That there's "Pie Boy,"
our mascot.

157
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,179
I don't talk like that.

158
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:39,517
I'm from Ottawa.

159
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,520
No.

160
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,455
I completely bought it.

161
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,825
"That's-a-great-a-pie."

162
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,394
The... The, uh...

163
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:54,266
The little... little guy,
is he supposed to be Italian?

164
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,399
I guess so.

165
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:58,237
Well, it's very clever.

166
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,576
Y'all come back now, you hear?

167
00:14:05,877 --> 00:14:07,579
"Y'all come back now."

168
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:12,216
Do you think he meant it?

169
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,853
He had noticed me.
I mean, you... you heard that.

170
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:20,691
This pie is rather sordid.

171
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,259
But don't spit it out.

172
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,394
Next time we go,

173
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,229
we'll just try
a different flavor. Hmm?

174
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,600
Save it for later,
put it away.

175
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:33,403
<i>6:00 AM eastern standard time.</i>

176
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,845
<i>The skies are beginning
to lighten...</i>

177
00:14:36,474 --> 00:14:38,676
<i>as a cool North wind rustles across...</i>

178
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,144
<i>...groups of
Negroes have been swarming</i>

179
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,111
<i>in front of and behind
the advancing police.</i>

180
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:44,048
Oh, dear God!
Change that awfulness.

181
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,919
I do not wanna see that.

182
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:48,655
I do not wanna see it.

183
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:54,124
Oh, that's better,
that's better.

184
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,092
Oh, look at Betty.

185
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:58,095
Oh, God, to be young
and beautiful.

186
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,532
If I could go back
to when I was 18...

187
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:02,966
I didn't know anything
about anything,

188
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,570
I'd give myself
a bit of advice.

189
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:08,806
I would say, "Take better
care of your teeth...

190
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,673
and fuck a lot more."

191
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:12,576
Oh no, no, that's very good advice.

192
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:07,300
Will you look at this?

193
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:09,466
Look.

194
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,967
Some of the best
minds in the country

195
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:14,004
peeing all over the floor
in this here facility.

196
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,440
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

197
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,308
There's pee freckles
on the ceiling now.

198
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,013
How'd they get it up there?

199
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,550
Just how big a target
do they need, you figure?

200
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,689
They get enough practice,
that's for sure.

201
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,190
My Brewster...

202
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,392
no one's ever called him
a great mind,

203
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:39,797
but even he manages
to hit the can

204
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,034
70% of the time.

205
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:46,470
Excuse us, sir.

206
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,572
No, no, no,
that's all right.

207
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:49,742
Go ahead.

208
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:55,044
You ladies seem to be
chatting enjoyably.

209
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:56,748
Girl talk, no doubt.

210
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,352
Don't mind me.

211
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:08,860
Elisa.

212
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:13,096
Look, don't touch.

213
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,463
That lovely dingus
right there

214
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:15,999
is an Alabama Howdy-do.

215
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,500
Molded grip handle...

216
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:20,403
low current, high-voltage,
electric shock cattle prod.

217
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:22,940
Name's Strickland, Security.

218
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,040
Fleming's security.

219
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,983
Oh, no.

220
00:17:33,985 --> 00:17:35,652
No, a man washes his hands

221
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:38,721
before or after
tending to his needs.

222
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:40,992
It tells you a lot
about a man.

223
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,528
He does it both times...

224
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,799
points to a weakness
in character.

225
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:51,436
Ladies.

226
00:17:54,272 --> 00:17:56,975
It was very pleasant
chatting with you both.

227
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:20,696
<i>Short people are mean.</i>

228
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:22,133
I never met a short man

229
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,067
that stayed nice
all the way through.

230
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,435
No, sir.

231
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,806
Mean little backstabbers,
all of them.

232
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,673
Maybe it's the air down there,

233
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:32,477
not enough oxygen
or something.

234
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,204
Help! He's losing blood!

235
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:03,272
Help!

236
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:04,575
Come on, come on.

237
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,548
You think
the Russians broke in?

238
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,982
I don't think so.

239
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:14,151
And if they did...

240
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,753
Duane's meatloaf
will kill them all, honey.

241
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,388
It was two shots.
Did you hear them?

242
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,724
All right, three.
And that scream.

243
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:23,527
Lord, what ever happens
in this place?

244
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,598
You two, come with me.

245
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,765
Right now, Mr. Fleming, sir?

246
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,766
Any chance we get
to conclude our dinner?

247
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,604
Now!

248
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,739
Oh, heavens to Betsy.

249
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,173
We are in a pickle.

250
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:39,210
We are in such a pickle.

251
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,886
You will have
exactly 20 minutes

252
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:53,655
to render this... this lab
immaculate, and so on and so forth.

253
00:19:53,657 --> 00:19:55,694
20 minutes.

254
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:59,865
It's a lot of blood.
What went on in here?

255
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:02,635
I can handle pee.

256
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,469
I can handle poo.

257
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:07,570
But blood... Ugh.

258
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:10,440
Blood just does
something to me.

259
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,909
Here, hon. Help me mop it up.

260
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,114
The sooner we get outta here
the better.

261
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,863
Is that a tater tot?

262
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:33,532
Oh!

263
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:35,701
It's a finger.

264
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:38,535
There's two fingers.

265
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,702
Okay, okay.

266
00:20:39,704 --> 00:20:41,605
Put them away.
And just wait here.

267
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,675
I'm gonna go get Mr. Fleming.

268
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,343
Where are these body parts?

269
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:20,613
The body parts?

270
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:28,651
No, I believe you, honey.

271
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:30,856
But are you sure it was alive?

272
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:34,124
Because I saw a mermaid once
in a carnival tent...

273
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,359
and it was a monkey
sewn to the tail of a fish.

274
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:38,363
Looked real to me.

275
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:41,230
All right, I apologize.

276
00:21:41,232 --> 00:21:42,934
Oh! I have a deadline.

277
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:45,167
Do you know,

278
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:48,139
corn flakes were invented
to prevent masturbation.

279
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,376
Didn't work.

280
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,845
Oh, Alice Faye just started.

281
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,881
She was a huge star, huge.

282
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,749
And one day, she couldn't
take the bullshit

283
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:00,953
and the backstabbing anymore.

284
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:04,221
She just walked away
from it all.

285
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:05,321
Ta-da!

286
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:06,390
That's not bad, is it?

287
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:07,827
For being shit.

288
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:13,195
Listen. You eat,
you go to bed, you rest.

289
00:22:13,197 --> 00:22:16,232
And when I get paid...

290
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,840
we get pie!

291
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,473
No, we don't get pie.
I get pie.

292
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:26,011
You get whatever you want.

293
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,279
Wish me luck.

294
00:22:57,108 --> 00:23:00,542
Green. They want the gelatin
to be green now.

295
00:23:00,544 --> 00:23:02,712
- I was told red.
- New concept.

296
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,080
That's the future now.
Green.

297
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:08,384
Oh, and they want them
happier, the family.

298
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,287
- Happier? Happier?
- Mmm.

299
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:11,153
The father looks like

300
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:12,454
he just discovered
the missionary position.

301
00:23:12,456 --> 00:23:13,589
Giles.

302
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:16,358
Well, what are they supposed
to be happy about?

303
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,195
The client wanted photographs,
I sold them on this.

304
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:21,230
It's too bad.
This is nice work.

305
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:24,136
It is nice, isn't it?
I think it's one of my best.

306
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:28,403
How are you holding up?
You drinking?

307
00:23:28,405 --> 00:23:30,906
No, not a drop. No.

308
00:23:30,908 --> 00:23:34,176
Are you getting any work since
you left Klein and Saunders?

309
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:36,680
You mean since I was asked
to leave by you.

310
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:39,382
We are not
getting into this now.

311
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,986
I wanna come back, Bernie.

312
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:45,757
We'll see.
Now, do this.

313
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,692
I think we're making
great progress.

314
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:50,930
Good work.

315
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:11,904
Elisa.

316
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:14,639
What are you doing in there?

317
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,344
Cleaning, huh?

318
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:20,743
Listen, honey.

319
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,512
Mr. "I pee with my hands
on my hips"

320
00:26:23,514 --> 00:26:25,082
wants to see us both.

321
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,883
<i>"Zelda D. Fuller."</i>

322
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,786
How long have you two
known each other, Zelda?

323
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,656
About 10 years, sir.

324
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,290
No siblings, Zelda?

325
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:36,291
No, sir.

326
00:26:36,293 --> 00:26:38,963
That's not common, is it?
For your people?

327
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:42,100
My mama died after me.

328
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:44,502
After I was born.

329
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:48,540
What does that "D" stand for?

330
00:26:49,974 --> 00:26:52,642
Delilah, sir.

331
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:53,977
On account of the Bible.

332
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,278
Delilah, she betrayed Samson.

333
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,083
Lulled him to sleep,
cut his hair.

334
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:03,051
Philistines tortured him,
humiliated him...

335
00:27:03,053 --> 00:27:04,989
burned his eyes out.

336
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,025
Guess my mama didn't read
the good book close enough.

337
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,229
And you...

338
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,163
"Elisa Esposito."

339
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,333
Doesn't "Esposito"
mean orphan?

340
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:19,067
"Our Lady of Sorrows
Orphanage in Putnam."

341
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:21,438
They found her by the river

342
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,975
in the water.

343
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,979
It was you
that found my fingers.

344
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,212
Oh!

345
00:27:30,214 --> 00:27:31,614
Thanks.

346
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,215
Three hours in surgery.

347
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:36,519
They rebuilt
the first phalanx here...

348
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,921
sutured the tendons.

349
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,692
Don't know if
it's gonna take or not.

350
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,826
There was mustard on them.
A paper bag?

351
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,461
It was all we had, sir.

352
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:48,531
I answer mostly on account
that she can't talk.

353
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,468
She can't? She deaf?

354
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,038
Mute, sir.

355
00:27:53,704 --> 00:27:55,340
She said she can hear you.

356
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,212
All those scars on your neck.

357
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,684
That's what did it.
Cut your voice box, right?

358
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,852
She said since she was a baby.

359
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,186
Who would do that to a baby?

360
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:13,388
The world is sinful.

361
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,191
Wouldn't you say so, Delilah?

362
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,162
Well, let me say this upfront.

363
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:21,230
You clean that lab,
you get out.

364
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:24,233
The thing we keep in there
is an affront.

365
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:26,836
Do you know what
an affront is, Zelda?

366
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,505
Something offensive.

367
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,239
That's right,
and I should know.

368
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:34,076
I dragged that filthy thing...

369
00:28:34,078 --> 00:28:36,613
out of the river muck
in South America

370
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:38,117
all the way here.

371
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,115
And along the way,

372
00:28:40,117 --> 00:28:42,117
we didn't get
to like each other much.

373
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:45,721
Now...

374
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:50,162
you may think that thing
looks human.

375
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,095
Stands on two legs, right?

376
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:56,234
But we're created
in the Lord's image.

377
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,635
You don't think that's what
the Lord looks like, do you?

378
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:03,173
I wouldn't know, sir,
what the Lord looks like.

379
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:06,110
Well, it's human, Zelda.
He looks like a human, like me.

380
00:29:07,044 --> 00:29:09,211
Or even you.

381
00:29:09,213 --> 00:29:11,416
Maybe a little more like me,
I guess.

382
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:16,120
That's all.

383
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,324
General Hoyt, thank you
for calling me back, sir.

384
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,593
<i>- Feeling better?</i>
- Oh, yes, sir, much better.

385
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,827
Pain pills is all.

386
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,296
- Close the door.
<i>- You lost two fingers, was it?</i>

387
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:28,364
Two fingers, yeah.
He got two fingers.

388
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,799
But I still got my thumb,

389
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,067
my trigger,
and my pussy finger.

390
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,902
<i>Sounds to me
like you'll do all right then.</i>

391
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,104
Yes, sir, that's right.

392
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,105
Looking forward
to your visit, sir.

393
00:29:37,107 --> 00:29:39,709
Decisions need to be made
about the asset.

394
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,446
<i>Flavors
of fruity pies await you.</i>

395
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:20,849
<i>Three new locations
in downtown Baltimore.</i>

396
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:22,551
<i>The future is here.</i>

397
00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:23,752
Get some rest.

398
00:30:23,754 --> 00:30:24,886
<i>Pumpkin, banana...</i>

399
00:30:24,888 --> 00:30:26,855
Pick me up at 9:30.

400
00:30:26,857 --> 00:30:28,793
2130 hours. Yes, sir.

401
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:32,694
<i>That's-a-great-a-pie.</i>

402
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:33,829
I'm home.

403
00:30:35,198 --> 00:30:36,565
I made you an omelet.

404
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,601
- Hey, Dad. Guess what?
- No pancakes?

405
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,303
I've been through half the boxes
and I can't find the griddles.

406
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,538
- Guess what?
- I made you a cheese and broccoli omelet.

407
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,605
How are you feeling?
Does it hurt?

408
00:30:43,607 --> 00:30:46,075
- A little bit. Pills help.
- Guess what?

409
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,343
What?

410
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,113
We're burying a time capsule
at the new school.

411
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:51,681
I wanted to ask you...

412
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,050
Do you think we'll all have
jetpacks in the future?

413
00:30:55,052 --> 00:30:56,519
Believe it, son.

414
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,655
Oh! Bus is here.

415
00:30:59,223 --> 00:31:00,759
This is America.

416
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:03,495
Bye, Dad!

417
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:08,530
Finish your omelet,

418
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:09,965
then wash your hands
real good...

419
00:31:09,967 --> 00:31:11,634
and come upstairs, sweetie.

420
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,670
I kind of like it here.
The kids like the lawn.

421
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,409
Plus DC is just half
an hour away, isn't it?

422
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:22,413
It's still Baltimore, Elaine.
No one likes Baltimore.

423
00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:26,818
You know what I'm thinking?

424
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,589
I'm thinking I need a new car.

425
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,199
You need a new car, do you?

426
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:44,402
How about a Cadillac, mister?

427
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:46,169
Richard.

428
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,205
Oh, Richard!

429
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,509
Sweetie, Sweetie?

430
00:31:54,511 --> 00:31:56,846
Sweetie, your, um,
your hand is bleeding.

431
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,080
Silence. Don't talk.

432
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,949
Don't talk.
I want you in silence.

433
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,218
Silent, silent. Yes.

434
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:04,855
Silence.

435
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,032
<i>Dr. Levensen to Aeronautics.</i>

436
00:32:18,034 --> 00:32:19,271
<i>Dr. Levensen to Aeronautics.</i>

437
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:24,990
Hey!

438
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,026
- Gotcha.
- No, you didn't.

439
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:09,198
"The sparrow nests
on the window..."

440
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,399
What?

441
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:15,270
"The sparrow nests
on the window sill!"

442
00:36:15,272 --> 00:36:17,439
"And the eagle
takes the prey."

443
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:18,609
What?

444
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:26,401
Elisa! Hurry, hurry, come on.

445
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:27,838
I swear to God, girl.

446
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:31,406
You're doing
it again, Zelda.

447
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:32,977
Oh, give it a rest, Yolanda.

448
00:38:58,468 --> 00:38:59,535
Whoo!

449
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:01,136
Hey, Zelda, want a smoke?

450
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,803
That shit ain't good
for you, Duane.

451
00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:04,274
Yeah, but it feel good.

452
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,642
It does, doesn't it?

453
00:39:07,644 --> 00:39:09,511
Come on, Elisa. Just one.

454
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,046
Come on, come on, come on.

455
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:14,084
Don't worry about that camera.
We push 'em up at break time.

456
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:17,856
Mmm-hmm.
- This here is a blind spot.

457
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,524
Man can't make meatloaf...

458
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,091
It adds a little spice.

459
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,296
<i>Sector Five,</i>

460
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:30,734
<i>must ready energy test
starting in two hours.</i>

461
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,683
Fleming, I have to
finish some things in here.

462
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,785
Fetch the general, will you?

463
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:05,370
Aww, you missed me, huh?

464
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:09,307
I took a candy break.

465
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,611
This is what scares you, huh?

466
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,293
Well, gee, you should
be used to it by now.

467
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:23,084
There you go again,
making that god-awful sound.

468
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:26,089
Is that you crying, huh?
Is that what it is?

469
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,192
Are you hurting?

470
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,058
Or maybe you're angry!

471
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,298
Maybe you'd like to get
another bite of me.

472
00:40:33,629 --> 00:40:35,129
Go ahead.

473
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:39,803
I can't tell.

474
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,171
I mean, are you begging?

475
00:40:43,173 --> 00:40:44,439
Because to me,

476
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:47,508
it's just the worst fucking
noise I ever heard.

477
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,171
<i>Paging Captain Walters.</i>

478
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:19,308
<i>Captain Walters, please
pick up the courtesy call.</i>

479
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,378
Elisa.

480
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,312
Elisa!

481
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,890
General Hoyt!
Welcome, sir!

482
00:41:35,892 --> 00:41:37,859
Everything's ready.
Glad to have you, sir.

483
00:41:37,861 --> 00:41:39,694
- Good to see you, son.
- Thank you.

484
00:41:39,696 --> 00:41:42,229
Good God Almighty!
Is that it?

485
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:43,832
Hell of a lot bigger
than I thought.

486
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,366
Ugly as sin.

487
00:41:45,368 --> 00:41:48,937
You know, the natives in the
Amazon worshiped it like a god.

488
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:52,006
Doesn't look like
much of a god now, does it?

489
00:41:52,008 --> 00:41:53,475
Well, they're primitive, sir.

490
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,477
You know, they would toss
offerings into the water.

491
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,412
Flowers, fruits,
crap like that.

492
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,381
Then they tried
to stop the oil drill

493
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:00,683
with bows and arrows.

494
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,051
That didn't turn out too well.

495
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,988
He's bleeding.

496
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,321
What happened?

497
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,323
It's an animal, Hoffstetler.
Just keeping it tame.

498
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:11,993
"Oxygen osmosis
and dioxide exchange."

499
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:13,562
What the hell
have we got here, son?

500
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:14,696
This creature, sir...

501
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,131
it can alternate between two

502
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,033
entirely separate
breathing mechanisms.

503
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,368
- A mudskipper can do that.
- No.

504
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,970
Look.

505
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,839
You want to put
a man in space.

506
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,408
He's gonna have
to endure conditions

507
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,843
the human body
just wasn't made for.

508
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:30,680
This gives us an edge
against the Soviets.

509
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:32,714
How long can it breathe
outside the water?

510
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,883
The reality is, sir,

511
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,587
we don't know jack shit
about this thing.

512
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:40,855
Well, the Soviets want it.
We know that much.

513
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:42,457
Those cockeyed bastards.

514
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,394
You know, we let 'em send
a dog up into space,

515
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,462
and we get a good laugh.

516
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:48,763
Then the next thing you know,
they send a human up,

517
00:42:48,765 --> 00:42:49,899
a Russki,

518
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,334
orbiting the planet,
doing God knows what.

519
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,370
Who's laughing then?
Khrushchev, that's who.

520
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:58,240
Let him send a dog up into
space, and he laughs.

521
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,709
Then he puts a commie
up in space, and he laughs.

522
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,080
And then he puts
missiles into Cuba.

523
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,046
Have we learned nothing?

524
00:43:05,048 --> 00:43:06,982
Sir, we need to
get him back in the water.

525
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:09,151
See, these scientists,
they're like artists, sir.

526
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,819
They fall in love
with their plaything.

527
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:12,354
Now, right here, see?

528
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:13,589
Along the middle.

529
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,991
This creature has
a thick-jointed cartilage

530
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:18,627
that separates the primary
and secondary lungs.

531
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:19,828
Am I explaining
this correctly, Bob?

532
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:20,928
Yes, but we have...

533
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,732
It makes the X-rays
inconclusive.

534
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,066
In principle, sir, yes. But...

535
00:43:25,068 --> 00:43:27,002
Now, I believe if we want to
get an edge on the Soviets

536
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,071
we need to vivisect
this thing.

537
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:30,037
- No, no.
- Take it apart,

538
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:31,140
- learn how it works.
- No.

539
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:33,144
No! That would
defeat the purpose.

540
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,347
Sir, he's passed out.
Please.

541
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:38,413
Put him in the tank.

542
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:39,584
Let him pressurize.

543
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:41,919
General Hoyt, sir?

544
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,921
You cannot,
under any circumstance,

545
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,125
kill this creature.

546
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:54,162
Count these stars
with me, son.

547
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:55,564
There are five of them.

548
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,899
Means I can do
whatever the hell I want.

549
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,167
Now, you want
to plead your case,

550
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:00,435
I'll listen to it.

551
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:04,073
But at the end of the day,
it is my damn decision.

552
00:44:49,352 --> 00:44:52,187
So crack the damn thing open,
learn what you can,

553
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,223
and close up shop here.

554
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:56,625
Give yourself a good
pat on the back, Strickland.

555
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:57,759
You've done it.

556
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:58,894
Thank you, sir.

557
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:01,029
Now, hurry up
and finish the job, son.

558
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,633
Absolutely, sir.

559
00:45:04,267 --> 00:45:05,734
<i>Get him out?</i>

560
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,669
What are you talking about?

561
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,673
No. Absolutely not.

562
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:12,841
Because it's breaking the law,
that's why.

563
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,113
We're probably breaking
the law just talking about it.

564
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,749
Oh, he's alone? Oh.

565
00:45:19,617 --> 00:45:21,049
Does this mean that whenever

566
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,350
we go to
a Chinese restaurant

567
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:25,453
you wanna save
every fish in the tank?

568
00:45:25,455 --> 00:45:28,425
So what if he's alone?
We're all alone.

569
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,160
The loneliest thing
you've ever seen?

570
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,062
Well, you just said it right there.
You just said it!

571
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,066
You called it a thing.
It's a thing. It's a freak.

572
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:39,037
I can understand you.

573
00:45:42,772 --> 00:45:44,709
Calm down. God, calm down.

574
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,311
All right,
I will repeat it to you.

575
00:45:52,982 --> 00:45:54,419
"What am I?

576
00:45:59,122 --> 00:46:02,159
"I move my mouth, like him.

577
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:06,562
"I make no sound, like him.

578
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:10,835
"What does that make me?

579
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:15,336
"All that I am...

580
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:17,805
"all that I've ever been...

581
00:46:17,807 --> 00:46:20,542
"brought me here, to him."

582
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:23,580
See, you're saying "him."
It's a "him" now.

583
00:46:24,682 --> 00:46:26,615
You just hit me!

584
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,082
Elisa, let go of me.

585
00:46:28,084 --> 00:46:29,317
I'm looking. I'm looking!

586
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:31,520
You've never hit me.

587
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:40,364
"When he looks at me,
the way he looks at me...

588
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:45,268
"He does not know
what I lack...

589
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:48,239
"or how...

590
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,142
"I am incomplete.

591
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:55,644
"He sees me...

592
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,180
"for what I am...

593
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,684
"as I am.

594
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,422
"He's happy...

595
00:47:05,256 --> 00:47:08,359
"to see me, every time...

596
00:47:09,091 --> 00:47:10,494
"every day.

597
00:47:11,961 --> 00:47:15,398
"And now I can either...

598
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,602
"save him...

599
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,375
or let him die."

600
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:29,211
Oh, God. I'm leaving.

601
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:32,180
Elisa, no. I have to leave.

602
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,582
Just... Elisa, please stop.

603
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:35,216
Listen to me.
Just listen to me.

604
00:47:35,218 --> 00:47:37,084
I have to go.

605
00:47:37,086 --> 00:47:39,254
I'm leaving now
because, Elisa,

606
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:40,388
this is very important to me.

607
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,990
This is a second
chance for me.

608
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:44,158
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

609
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,727
Oh, God.

610
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:46,995
When I come back,
we just will not talk

611
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:48,629
about this ever again.

612
00:47:48,631 --> 00:47:50,165
Elisa, there's...

613
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,232
All right!

614
00:47:52,535 --> 00:47:54,669
What are we?
What are you and I?

615
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,738
Do you know what we are?
We're nothing!

616
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,573
Nothing! We can do nothing!

617
00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:02,410
I'm sorry, but this...
this is just...

618
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,581
Oh, God, it's not
even human. God!

619
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,855
What?

620
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:28,706
Giles.

621
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,778
- I've been waiting.
- I know. Sorry.

622
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,781
It's okay.

623
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:39,217
We going in?

624
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,883
You should have
just mailed the art.

625
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:42,850
No.

626
00:48:42,852 --> 00:48:45,720
I want to show it to you
and the team in person.

627
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:47,689
I think it's some
of my best work.

628
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:50,459
And it's green as can be.

629
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:54,497
It's, uh, it's not a good time.
Maybe later.

630
00:48:56,966 --> 00:48:58,732
Oh. Well, sure.

631
00:48:58,734 --> 00:48:59,903
No problem.

632
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:04,742
What would be a good time
for you, Bernie?

633
00:49:12,448 --> 00:49:14,450
You painted that?

634
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:15,750
Yeah.

635
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:17,551
Wowee!

636
00:49:17,553 --> 00:49:18,819
You're good.

637
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:21,288
Apparently, not as good
as a photograph.

638
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:24,859
But it is good, isn't it?

639
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:26,861
I couldn't paint
anything like that.

640
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:29,196
Here. On me.

641
00:49:29,198 --> 00:49:30,365
For me?

642
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,866
Well, we don't get
many like you in here.

643
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:35,006
You seem very educated,
and I like talking to you.

644
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:39,408
The thing is that's...

645
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,877
the only reason
that I come in here is...

646
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:43,745
- The conversation.
- And?

647
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,846
The pie is mighty fine,
too, isn't it?

648
00:49:45,848 --> 00:49:46,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

649
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:50,421
It's no key lime,
but it's good.

650
00:49:54,156 --> 00:49:56,457
You know, I work alone...

651
00:49:56,459 --> 00:50:00,895
and my best friend's not much
of a conversationalist.

652
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:02,596
You see, that's part
of doing the job here.

653
00:50:02,598 --> 00:50:04,698
It's like being a bartender.

654
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,801
You serve people pie.
You listen to their problems.

655
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:08,372
You get to know them.

656
00:50:10,573 --> 00:50:12,841
I'd like to get
to know you better.

657
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,408
What the hell
are you doing, old man?

658
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,678
- Let's sit down.
- Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

659
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,544
Hey, no, no, no.

660
00:50:17,546 --> 00:50:19,080
Not the counter.
Takeout only.

661
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:20,348
You can't sit there.

662
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,950
If you want something,
you order, you take it out.

663
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:24,386
But it's empty.
The... the counter's empty.

664
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,991
All reserved, all day.
You don't sit down.

665
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:32,363
Y'all come back now, you hear?

666
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,963
You don't need
to talk to them like that.

667
00:50:36,332 --> 00:50:38,566
You should go, too.

668
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:41,504
And don't come back.
This is a family restaurant.

669
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:03,024
I have no one.

670
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:05,562
And you are the only person
that I can talk to.

671
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:09,633
Now, whatever this thing is...

672
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:11,868
you need it.

673
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,002
So...

674
00:51:15,004 --> 00:51:17,038
you just tell me
what to do.

675
00:51:35,524 --> 00:51:38,694
- "All hope fades."
- "As the spring recedes."

676
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:39,730
Let's go.

677
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:39,680
Cadillac DeVille.
Best car ever made.

678
00:53:39,682 --> 00:53:43,718
V8, 390 CID, clean and crisp
like a fresh dollar bill.

679
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,352
I'm just idling around.

680
00:53:45,354 --> 00:53:46,787
And I'm just talking.

681
00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:48,589
AM radio, air conditioner,

682
00:53:48,591 --> 00:53:52,560
power windows, power brakes,
power steering, power seats.

683
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,562
All deluxe interior
appointment choices,

684
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,096
143 options.

685
00:53:56,098 --> 00:53:57,832
Now, this...

686
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:00,634
- is the Taj Mahal on wheels.
- Hmm.

687
00:54:00,636 --> 00:54:02,236
I'm not sure about the green.

688
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,638
It's not green,
my friend. Teal.

689
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,772
- Well, teal looks green to me.
- But it isn't, see?

690
00:54:05,774 --> 00:54:07,975
It's a limited edition,
12 coats of paint...

691
00:54:07,977 --> 00:54:09,276
polished by hand,

692
00:54:09,278 --> 00:54:11,379
all authentic
chrome detailing.

693
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,281
Four out of five
successful men in America

694
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:14,448
drive a Cadillac.

695
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:15,582
That a fact?

696
00:54:15,584 --> 00:54:16,783
This here is the future.

697
00:54:16,785 --> 00:54:19,220
And you strike me as a man
who is headed there.

698
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:20,921
- Where?
- Why, the future.

699
00:54:20,923 --> 00:54:24,127
You're the man of the future.
You belong in this car.

700
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:19,980
Wow!

701
00:55:19,982 --> 00:55:22,385
Sir, that is a...
that is a beautiful car!

702
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,919
What can I say?

703
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:26,723
You gotta feel good
driving that, huh?

704
00:55:27,856 --> 00:55:30,290
And what a wonderful
shade of green, huh?

705
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:31,859
Teal.

706
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:33,030
Teal.

707
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:44,071
Tomorrow, I'll make
a mean meatloaf.

708
00:55:44,073 --> 00:55:45,073
Mmm-hmm.

709
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:47,745
Just for you, extra raisins.

710
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:14,836
So, at 5:00 AM,
I drive my car

711
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:16,071
down the loading ramp.

712
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:18,406
And the shifts are changing,
and I have...

713
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:20,375
How much time do I have?

714
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,975
Five minutes? I'll remember.

715
00:56:21,977 --> 00:56:24,412
5:00 AM, five minutes.
Five-five, five-five.

716
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,915
So, you're going
to move the cameras, right?

717
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:28,982
And I'm gonna be
synchronizing our watches

718
00:56:28,984 --> 00:56:30,884
just like they do
in the movies.

719
00:56:30,886 --> 00:56:33,555
Oh, God! I'm so proud of you.

720
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,892
God! You're not afraid!

721
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,761
You are? Very?

722
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:42,564
Don't tell me that.
I'm terrified.

723
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:49,270
I think this is some
of my best work.

724
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:51,638
"Michael Parker." I think
it's a good, trustworthy name.

725
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,774
It's a little butch.

726
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:54,845
Yes, age 51.

727
00:56:56,078 --> 00:56:57,080
54?

728
00:56:59,615 --> 00:57:00,818
You don't have to be rude.

729
00:57:02,151 --> 00:57:03,486
57.

730
00:57:04,555 --> 00:57:05,620
If I put the hair on,

731
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,221
I can pull it off.
I can wear this...

732
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:08,189
or I have...

733
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:10,892
Thor, go. Off, off, off! Go!

734
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:12,026
Or I have this.

735
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:14,328
Now this, I think it says
"working man."

736
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,899
But this, now this says...

737
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,901
this says with
the butterscotch tie...

738
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:23,604
This says "casual,
but still stylish."

739
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,607
So, you like this?
I agree, I agree.

740
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,042
I think we're ready.

741
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:50,665
Mr. Strickland!

742
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,399
Sally, could you call
Miss Esposito

743
00:57:52,401 --> 00:57:54,137
to clean up a spill?

744
00:57:57,607 --> 00:58:00,707
You know,
I can't figure it out myself.

745
00:58:00,709 --> 00:58:02,278
You're not much to look at...

746
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:04,779
but go figure.

747
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:06,848
I keep thinking about you.

748
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,850
When you say you're mute,
are you entirely silent...

749
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:11,921
or do you squawk a little?

750
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:15,656
Some mutes squawk.
Not pretty, but...

751
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:16,993
Hmm?

752
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:21,565
I just want you to know...

753
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:25,265
I don't mind those scars.

754
00:58:25,267 --> 00:58:28,102
I don't mind that
you can't speak, either.

755
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:30,540
When you come
right down to it...

756
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,010
I like it.

757
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,344
A lot.

758
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:38,281
It kind of gets me going.

759
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:47,457
I bet I can make you
squawk a little.

760
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,559
Hey, honey. You okay?

761
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:25,759
Hurry up.
I wanna be home early.

762
00:59:25,761 --> 00:59:27,296
My feet are killing me.

763
00:59:54,055 --> 00:59:56,025
We need to delay
the procedure.

764
00:59:56,825 --> 00:59:58,692
Knock before
you enter my office.

765
00:59:58,694 --> 00:59:59,963
This is urgent!

766
01:00:00,731 --> 01:00:02,296
Go back out, knock,

767
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:03,497
then I'll let you in
and we'll talk.

768
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:06,168
That's the protocol.
Follow the protocol.

769
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:13,475
Come in.

770
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:15,312
Would you get the door
for me, please?

771
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,417
See? That's the way.
Now, we talk.

772
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:24,951
I need more time.

773
01:00:24,953 --> 01:00:26,955
Don't let the fact
that you feel like a loser

774
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,223
now that you've let your
competitive tendencies...

775
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:31,859
I'm not competitive!
I don't want an intricate,

776
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:33,296
beautiful thing destroyed!

777
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:39,267
This thing dies...

778
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:42,037
you learn, I leave,
out of here.

779
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:44,004
I settle down.

780
01:00:44,006 --> 01:00:46,808
My family settles down
somewhere nice.

781
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,478
<i>A real city.</i>

782
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:57,084
This creature
is intelligent...

783
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:59,019
capable of language...

784
01:00:59,021 --> 01:01:01,457
of understanding emotions.

785
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,390
So are the Soviets, the Gooks.

786
01:01:04,392 --> 01:01:07,328
And we still kill them,
don't we?

787
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:10,029
The bottom line is,
this isn't a petting zoo

788
01:01:10,031 --> 01:01:12,466
and I don't wanna be
in this shit hole

789
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:14,000
any longer than need be.

790
01:01:14,002 --> 01:01:15,504
Do you?

791
01:01:16,406 --> 01:01:19,543
Bob. Do you?

792
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:22,979
No, I don't.

793
01:01:44,066 --> 01:01:46,069
Hey, what are you waiting for?

794
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:48,669
Have you seen Elisa?

795
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,339
Come on, Zelda!

796
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:06,153
Did you move
the camera on the loading dock?

797
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:07,788
Is that where
you're taking him?

798
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:09,256
Through the service tunnels?

799
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:11,160
That's very smart.

800
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:13,727
Who do you work for?

801
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:35,950
His water must be kept
at 5 to 8% salinity.

802
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:37,519
Table salt will do.

803
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:41,490
Mix one of these in his water
every three days.

804
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:45,526
Raw protein diet is a must.

805
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:47,194
In five minutes...

806
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:48,729
<i>I'll meet you
at the loading dock.</i>

807
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:50,163
<i>The lights will go out...</i>

808
01:02:50,165 --> 01:02:51,734
<i>so be prepared.</i>

809
01:03:11,252 --> 01:03:13,020
Mr. Strickland, sir?

810
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:15,388
Twelve hours to
the vivisection of the asset.

811
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:17,793
And I need your signature
here, please.

812
01:03:21,698 --> 01:03:23,997
<i>...this
sudden, clandestine decision</i>

813
01:03:23,999 --> 01:03:25,500
<i>to station strategic weapons</i>

814
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:28,171
<i>for the first time
outside of Soviet soil...</i>

815
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:31,372
Hold it right there.

816
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:33,709
<i>...an unjustified change
in the status quo...</i>

817
01:03:52,193 --> 01:03:54,294
"Michael Parker." Is that you?

818
01:03:54,296 --> 01:03:55,765
My whole life.

819
01:04:13,048 --> 01:04:14,550
Are you out of your mind?

820
01:04:16,685 --> 01:04:20,222
Don't do this, Elisa.
Don't do this!

821
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:27,694
What's that?
What's that vehicle?

822
01:04:27,696 --> 01:04:31,564
Gosh, sir, I'm not sure.
It's a laundry van?

823
01:04:31,566 --> 01:04:33,602
But it's not scheduled.

824
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:39,740
<i>And finally,</i>

825
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:41,808
<i>I call upon
Chairman Khrushchev</i>

826
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:43,446
<i>to halt and eliminate...</i>

827
01:04:44,345 --> 01:04:46,279
<i>this clandestine, reckless,</i>

828
01:04:46,281 --> 01:04:48,515
<i>and provocative threat
to world peace</i>

829
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:51,354
<i>and to stable relations
between our two nations.</i>

830
01:04:57,459 --> 01:04:58,292
Sir?

831
01:04:58,294 --> 01:05:01,095
- Meet me at the loading dock.
- Sir!

832
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:02,937
- Sir, what do you need me to do?
- Get backup.

833
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:07,901
Step out of the vehicle, sir.

834
01:05:07,903 --> 01:05:09,470
Oh, God. I'm not good at this.

835
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,605
Out of the vehicle now.
I will not say it again.

836
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:13,473
- Oh, God. Please don't shoot me!
- Get out!

837
01:05:13,475 --> 01:05:14,715
Oh, God.
Don't shoot me. Please.

838
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,923
What are you waiting for?
We're out of time!

839
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:29,626
Get out now!

840
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:33,461
You have to go. Hurry!

841
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:35,962
Oh, woman,
we're gonna burn in hell.

842
01:05:35,964 --> 01:05:37,198
Come on, push.

843
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,602
Push!

844
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:42,602
I swear, I'm not
doing this on purpose!

845
01:05:42,604 --> 01:05:44,807
Mechanical objects and I
just don't get along!

846
01:05:48,843 --> 01:05:49,843
What the...

847
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:52,212
She's waiting for you
at the dock. Go! Now!

848
01:06:07,796 --> 01:06:09,636
Who's that man? I think
he just killed someone.

849
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:13,903
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

850
01:06:28,984 --> 01:06:30,787
Are we ready,
are we ready?

851
01:06:37,193 --> 01:06:38,961
He's so beautiful.

852
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:48,672
Did I do that?

853
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:52,709
I'm just not good at this.

854
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:55,343
Move! Move!

855
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,689
Come on. No.

856
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:45,494
No!

857
01:08:06,481 --> 01:08:08,884
Salt? What are you
talking about, salt?

858
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:12,555
Elisa!

859
01:09:03,138 --> 01:09:04,140
There.

860
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:23,059
Israeli Popper.

861
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:27,163
You can smell the magnesium.

862
01:09:28,596 --> 01:09:29,929
Russians hate the Jews,

863
01:09:29,931 --> 01:09:32,501
but they can't get enough
of their gadgets.

864
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:35,602
How'd they get in here?

865
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:38,538
Forged ID, painted plates,
and so on and so forth.

866
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:42,209
And they moved the main
video camera on the dock, sir.

867
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:43,376
Well, no one has to know.

868
01:09:43,378 --> 01:09:45,112
We got 24 hours
before I bounce it up.

869
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:47,046
No, I called it in.

870
01:09:47,048 --> 01:09:48,182
You called it in?

871
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,718
The moment it happened, I...

872
01:09:50,418 --> 01:09:51,954
Mr. Strickland, sir.

873
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:54,755
What is it, Sally?

874
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:57,425
Sir, General Hoyt
is on the phone.

875
01:09:57,427 --> 01:10:00,193
<i>That thing was
our space dog, Strickland.</i>

876
01:10:00,195 --> 01:10:01,327
<i>You know that.</i>

877
01:10:01,329 --> 01:10:03,162
Sir, I'm getting it back.

878
01:10:03,164 --> 01:10:07,099
I can't be in a negative
frame of mind, sir.

879
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:08,469
<i>So, you're feeling good?</i>

880
01:10:08,471 --> 01:10:10,670
Feeling strong.
Getting it back.

881
01:10:10,672 --> 01:10:13,607
<i>You can get it done.
You're gonna get it done.</i>

882
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:16,079
<i>For me, son. For me.</i>

883
01:10:57,319 --> 01:11:00,019
That's when you're
planning on releasing him?

884
01:11:00,021 --> 01:11:01,623
On the 10th?

885
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:04,724
So, what if the rains
are late?

886
01:11:04,726 --> 01:11:06,194
What happens with the canal?

887
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:09,031
All right.

888
01:11:13,101 --> 01:11:14,570
What's that?

889
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:18,141
Let me see it.
Is that for me?

890
01:11:56,913 --> 01:12:00,717
Yeah, that's good.
Keep that up.

891
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:04,718
Looking like
you don't know anything.

892
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:08,354
Lord help me,
if they ask me if I do.

893
01:12:08,356 --> 01:12:09,723
I'm not a good liar.

894
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:11,024
Except to Brewster.

895
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:13,693
It takes a lot of lies
to keep a marriage going.

896
01:12:13,695 --> 01:12:15,094
<i>All personnel,</i>

897
01:12:15,096 --> 01:12:17,663
<i>prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>

898
01:12:17,665 --> 01:12:21,268
Lord! What in the...

899
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,135
<i>Attention. All personnel,</i>

900
01:12:23,137 --> 01:12:26,506
<i>prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>

901
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,642
You done got us
in a world of trouble.

902
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:29,876
My opinion,
we're looking

903
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:31,545
at a highly-trained
group, sir.

904
01:12:31,547 --> 01:12:33,313
I'm thinking,
conceivably, sir,

905
01:12:33,315 --> 01:12:35,849
like special forces
or so on and so forth.

906
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:37,584
Red Army Special Forces?

907
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:38,785
Conceivably.

908
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:40,219
And they're highly trained.

909
01:12:40,221 --> 01:12:43,057
They were well-financed,
an elite group.

910
01:12:43,059 --> 01:12:46,026
Highly efficient, ruthless,
clockwork precision.

911
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,960
Infiltration took less
than five minutes, sir.

912
01:12:47,962 --> 01:12:49,830
My conservative estimate
is that this was

913
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:51,700
a strike force
of at least 10 men.

914
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:06,281
<i>My master sends this dress.</i>

915
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:09,051
Have you always been alone?

916
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:15,324
Did you ever have someone?

917
01:13:16,891 --> 01:13:19,059
Do you know what
happened to you? Do you?

918
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,230
Because I don't. I don't know
what happened to me.

919
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:23,996
I don't know.

920
01:13:23,998 --> 01:13:26,433
I look in the mirror and the
only thing that I recognize

921
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:28,004
are these eyes...

922
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:31,073
in this old man's face.

923
01:13:36,177 --> 01:13:38,411
You know, sometimes I think
I was either born too early

924
01:13:38,413 --> 01:13:39,781
or too late for my life.

925
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:46,252
Maybe we're both just relics.

926
01:13:46,254 --> 01:13:48,288
<i>Security
measures have been increased</i>

927
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:49,488
<i>to maximum levels.</i>

928
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:53,128
<i>Prepare to present your

929
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:57,997
<i>Attention.</i>

930
01:13:57,999 --> 01:14:00,800
<i>Security measures have been
increased to maximum levels.</i>

931
01:14:00,802 --> 01:14:02,935
Sir, I've got them.

932
01:14:02,937 --> 01:14:05,440
Zelda, Elisa. All right.

933
01:14:08,276 --> 01:14:09,412
Here we go.

934
01:14:11,379 --> 01:14:12,411
Mmm-hmm.

935
01:14:12,413 --> 01:14:15,247
Looks like you two punched out
before the incident.

936
01:14:15,249 --> 01:14:17,017
Still.

937
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:19,551
If you know something
about what transpired here

938
01:14:19,553 --> 01:14:22,288
it's your obligation...

939
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:23,890
to report any detail,

940
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:26,926
no matter how small
or trivial it may seem.

941
01:14:26,928 --> 01:14:29,129
"Trivial" means unimportant.

942
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:33,166
I didn't see nothing
out of the ordinary, no.

943
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:34,600
Or trivial.

944
01:14:34,602 --> 01:14:36,370
See, my feet were hurting.

945
01:14:36,372 --> 01:14:37,539
What about you?

946
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,543
She didn't see anything.

947
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:44,479
Mmm.

948
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:53,386
Hoffstetler, Dr. Hoffstetler.

949
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:56,156
Did either of you see him
coming in or out of the lab?

950
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,125
He works there, doesn't he?

951
01:14:58,127 --> 01:15:02,464
I mean in a different way,
doing something different.

952
01:15:03,864 --> 01:15:06,001
Something trivial?

953
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:07,904
No, sir.

954
01:15:21,749 --> 01:15:26,254
What am I doing,
interviewing the fucking help?

955
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:29,325
The shit cleaners.

956
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:32,194
The piss wipers.

957
01:15:35,529 --> 01:15:37,899
You two, go ahead. Leave.

958
01:15:42,904 --> 01:15:46,374
All right, you're clear.
So, back to work. Go on.

959
01:15:48,142 --> 01:15:49,578
What'd you say to me?

960
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:55,852
What is she saying?

961
01:15:57,619 --> 01:15:58,921
I didn't catch it.

962
01:15:59,754 --> 01:16:01,086
What is she saying?

963
01:16:01,088 --> 01:16:03,592
She... she is saying thank you.

964
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:15,137
Next!

965
01:16:32,587 --> 01:16:37,090
<i>I didn't see you
last night or the night before.</i>

966
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:38,524
<i>I'm sorry, Ed,</i>

967
01:16:38,526 --> 01:16:40,193
<i>but now that I'm spending
all day long in the office,</i>

968
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:42,696
<i>Carol feels that I... I should
spend my evenings with her.</i>

969
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:45,532
<i>Well, if you
spend the evenings with her,</i>

970
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:46,767
<i>when will I?</i>

971
01:16:54,275 --> 01:16:57,345
<i>There's only
one thing left to do.</i>

972
01:16:58,346 --> 01:16:59,545
<i>Volunteer.</i>

973
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:30,212
No! No, no, no, no, no!

974
01:17:54,101 --> 01:17:56,469
I wanna get home early.

975
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:59,575
Brewster's been in
a bad mood lately.

976
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,510
Holy Jesus!

977
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,178
What are you doin'
standing in the shadows

978
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,513
of the women's locker room?

979
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,448
They may be watching me,
and there are no cameras here.

980
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:09,483
For good reason.

981
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:11,350
But have you caught us
at an inconvenient moment!

982
01:18:11,352 --> 01:18:13,185
I need to know
that he's alright.

983
01:18:13,187 --> 01:18:15,255
- He is.
- When will you release him?

984
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:16,456
Soon.

985
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:19,562
When the rain fills the canal
that flows to the sea.

986
01:18:22,696 --> 01:18:24,563
If you need anything...

987
01:18:24,565 --> 01:18:26,135
Release him. Soon.

988
01:18:29,637 --> 01:18:31,336
What did she say?

989
01:18:31,338 --> 01:18:34,010
She said you're a good man,
Dr. Hoffstetler.

990
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:38,713
My name is Dimitri.

991
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,519
Honored to meet you.

992
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:47,621
Hey, dummy!
Phone call for you.

993
01:18:47,623 --> 01:18:49,488
It's urgent.

994
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:56,598
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

995
01:18:57,598 --> 01:18:58,601
Believe me. I'm fine.

996
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:01,033
He ate Pandora.

997
01:19:01,035 --> 01:19:03,435
Wasn't his fault.
He's a wild creature.

998
01:19:03,437 --> 01:19:05,737
We can't ask him
to be anything else.

999
01:19:05,739 --> 01:19:07,540
Elisa, go find him.

1000
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:09,541
Go. Go.

1001
01:19:09,543 --> 01:19:10,876
Go!

1002
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:13,580
You're lucky.

1003
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:17,480
Ow.

1004
01:20:18,879 --> 01:20:21,281
I stayed awake
as long as I could.

1005
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:23,252
You know,
I'm not even mad anymore.

1006
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:25,488
Is he all right?
You sure?

1007
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,122
Where you going?

1008
01:20:30,124 --> 01:20:31,593
No, no.

1009
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:33,492
Okay, don't... no, no.

1010
01:20:33,494 --> 01:20:34,960
Don't... don't play
with the kitties.

1011
01:20:34,962 --> 01:20:36,062
No, no.

1012
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:37,697
Don't play with the kitties.

1013
01:20:37,699 --> 01:20:39,467
I'm not... I'm not angry.

1014
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,839
Oh, my!

1015
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:55,448
You did that. It's okay.

1016
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:57,153
It's... ooh. I don't
think that's sanitary.

1017
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:02,525
Enough.

1018
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:07,762
Oh, God.

1019
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:14,736
Interesting guy.

1020

How's it going?

1024
01:21:28,248 --> 01:21:30,183
The investigation?

1025
01:21:30,185 --> 01:21:31,820
Well, we have
a promising lead.

1026
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:33,789
Really?

1027
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:37,258
That's good to hear.

1028
01:21:38,494 --> 01:21:40,225
You joined us in Galveston,

1029
01:21:40,227 --> 01:21:42,228
but where were
you before, Hoffstetler?

1030
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,863
- Doctor.
- Excuse me?

1031
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:45,801
Doctor Hoffstetler.

1032
01:21:48,035 --> 01:21:49,370
Protocol.

1033
01:21:51,272 --> 01:21:53,206
Wisconsin. Madison.

1034
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:54,407
Oh that's right.

1035
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:56,943
You gave up a tenure
track position, didn't you?

1036
01:21:56,945 --> 01:22:00,583
Gave it all up for us.

1037
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:04,751
I suppose...

1038
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:08,121
you'll be getting ready
to leave us now then, huh?

1039
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:09,857
Only if the creature
isn't found.

1040
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,359
Well, what do you think?

1041
01:22:14,361 --> 01:22:15,594
You think we will find it?

1042
01:22:15,596 --> 01:22:17,999
Well, you said
you had a lead.

1043
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:20,669
I do.

1044
01:25:10,971 --> 01:25:12,440
Why you smiling, hon?

1045
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:15,944
Stop looking like that.

1046
01:25:18,547 --> 01:25:20,015
What happened?

1047
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:24,953
Why?

1048
01:25:26,119 --> 01:25:27,588
How?

1049
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:29,725
How?

1050
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:32,927
Does he have a...?

1051
01:25:39,066 --> 01:25:40,435
Mm-hmm.

1052
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:43,137
Mm-hmm.

1053
01:25:50,677 --> 01:25:52,879
Oh!

1054
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:54,947
Never trust a man.

1055
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:57,282
Even when he looks
flat down there.

1056
01:27:17,466 --> 01:27:18,734
Hmm.

1057
01:27:59,606 --> 01:28:02,640
<i>You rang?</i>

1058
01:28:02,642 --> 01:28:05,611
<i>Oh, hi, Maynard. I
just signed up for anthropology.</i>

1059
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:08,880
<i>We're gonna hold class in the
Amazon jungle in South America.</i>

1060
01:28:08,882 --> 01:28:10,816
<i>South America?
Ooh, man, Dob.</i>

1061
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:12,551
<i>You're gonna have to get up awful early
in the morning. That's a long hike.</i>

1062
01:28:12,553 --> 01:28:14,452
<i>No, Maynard, we're gonna stay down there.</i>

1063
01:28:14,454 --> 01:28:17,357
<i>- We are?
- Oh, no, you're not coming along, too.</i>

1064
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:20,928
This is a gelatin parfait.

1065
01:28:21,562 --> 01:28:22,961
You're gonna love it.

1066
01:28:22,963 --> 01:28:24,130
Dad, can we watch <i>Bonanza?</i>

1067
01:28:24,132 --> 01:28:26,532
<i>Bonanza</i> is much too violent.

1068
01:28:26,534 --> 01:28:27,800
You know what
I was thinking today?

1069
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:30,937
We get the kids
a P-U-P-P-Y.

1070
01:30:29,923 --> 01:30:31,791
Let's go. Come on.

1071
01:30:31,793 --> 01:30:33,028
Let's get out of here.

1072
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:20,939
What is going on?!

1073
01:31:20,941 --> 01:31:23,309
I've got water
pouring into my theater!

1074
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:26,011
I have four paying customers!
I've got to offer refunds.

1075
01:31:26,013 --> 01:31:27,380
It's probably a pipe.
I'll take care of it.

1076
01:31:27,382 --> 01:31:29,342
- You don't fix it, no more rent!
- I will fix it.

1077
01:31:46,467 --> 01:31:49,004
Elisa?

1078
01:31:50,805 --> 01:31:53,008
Dear God. Elisa!

1079
01:32:22,669 --> 01:32:24,506
I'm toweling my hair!

1080
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,042
It's my hair.

1081
01:32:27,842 --> 01:32:29,841
Ah, just...

1082
01:32:29,843 --> 01:32:31,376
Oh! Look at my arm.

1083
01:32:31,378 --> 01:32:33,612
The wound. It's like
it was never there.

1084
01:32:33,614 --> 01:32:35,015
Look at that.

1085
01:32:35,682 --> 01:32:37,215
Now you said that...

1086
01:32:37,217 --> 01:32:38,483
you know, he was worshiped
like a god.

1087
01:32:38,485 --> 01:32:40,053
Now, is he a god?
I don't know if he's a god.

1088
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:42,153
I mean, he ate a cat,
so I don't... I don't know.

1089
01:32:42,155 --> 01:32:43,755
I don't know, but, I mean,

1090
01:32:43,757 --> 01:32:45,359
we have to keep him
around awhile.

1091
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:48,229
Little while.

1092
01:33:07,515 --> 01:33:08,617
Hello?

1093
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:50,718
<i>Your water, sir.</i>

1094
01:34:52,285 --> 01:34:55,554
- And sir, General Hoyt...
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1095
01:34:55,556 --> 01:34:56,721
Tell him I'm not here.

1096
01:34:56,723 --> 01:34:58,889
Tell him I'll call him back.
Don't put him through.

1097
01:34:58,891 --> 01:35:00,192
No, sir...

1098
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:02,062
He... he's in your office.

1099
01:35:05,232 --> 01:35:08,300
At this point,
our only concern is the asset.

1100
01:35:08,302 --> 01:35:10,739
- Do you have it?
- Still in the winds, sir.

1101
01:35:11,838 --> 01:35:13,107
Well, that won't do.

1102
01:35:13,975 --> 01:35:15,543
Yes, sir, I know.

1103
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:20,145
You've known me
how long, sir?

1104
01:35:20,147 --> 01:35:22,447
Thirteen years.
Battle of Pusan.

1105
01:35:22,449 --> 01:35:24,183
Yes, sir.

1106
01:35:24,185 --> 01:35:27,252
A man is faithful,
loyal, efficient all his life.

1107
01:35:27,254 --> 01:35:29,822
All of it. And he is...

1108
01:35:29,824 --> 01:35:30,790
useful.

1109
01:35:30,792 --> 01:35:33,395
And he expects...

1110
01:35:35,029 --> 01:35:37,732
He has certain
expectations in return.

1111
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:42,201
And then, he fails once.

1112
01:35:42,203 --> 01:35:44,969
Only once.
What does that make him?

1113
01:35:44,971 --> 01:35:46,607
That make him a failure?

1114
01:35:50,544 --> 01:35:52,577
When is a man done, sir?

1115
01:35:52,579 --> 01:35:54,746
Proving himself?

1116
01:35:54,748 --> 01:35:56,881
A good man?

1117
01:35:56,883 --> 01:35:58,586
A decent man?

1118
01:36:02,422 --> 01:36:04,059
"Decent?"

1119
01:36:08,495 --> 01:36:12,363
A man has the decency
not to fuck up.

1120
01:36:12,365 --> 01:36:14,099
Now that's one thing.

1121
01:36:14,101 --> 01:36:16,335
That's real decent of him.

1122
01:36:16,337 --> 01:36:19,071
But the other kind of decency?

1123
01:36:19,073 --> 01:36:20,206
It doesn't really matter.

1124
01:36:20,208 --> 01:36:23,308
Well sell it,
but it's an export.

1125
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:25,713
We sell it,
because we don't use it.

1126
01:36:27,047 --> 01:36:28,913
36 hours from now...

1127
01:36:28,915 --> 01:36:32,720
this entire episode
will be over.

1128
01:36:34,588 --> 01:36:35,823
And so will you.

1129
01:36:37,391 --> 01:36:40,559
Our universe
will have a hole in it

1130
01:36:40,561 --> 01:36:42,661
with your outline.

1131
01:36:42,663 --> 01:36:44,964
And you will have moved on

1132
01:36:44,966 --> 01:36:47,401
to an alternate universe.

1133
01:36:48,703 --> 01:36:50,472
A universe of shit.

1134
01:36:52,539 --> 01:36:55,209
You'll be lost
to civilization.

1135
01:36:57,410 --> 01:37:00,280
And you will be unborn.

1136
01:37:01,614 --> 01:37:03,650
Unmade.

1137
01:37:04,918 --> 01:37:06,488
And undone.

1138
01:37:13,093 --> 01:37:15,696
So go get some
real decency, son.

1139
01:37:16,830 --> 01:37:18,764
And unfuck this mess.

1140
01:37:54,668 --> 01:37:56,367
36 hours.

1141
01:37:56,369 --> 01:37:58,336
36 hours. Well, shit.

1142
01:37:58,338 --> 01:38:00,139
You deliver. You deliver,
that's what you do.

1143
01:38:00,141 --> 01:38:02,207
You deliver! Right? Right?!

1144
01:38:55,195 --> 01:38:56,964
know...

1145
01:39:16,016 --> 01:39:17,619
You'll...

1146
01:39:18,852 --> 01:39:20,754
never know...

1147
01:39:21,855 --> 01:39:24,791
just how much...

1148
01:39:27,061 --> 01:39:28,928
I...

1149
01:39:28,930 --> 01:39:31,966
love you.

1150
01:39:34,068 --> 01:39:36,768
You'll...

1151
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:39,104
never know...

1152
01:39:39,106 --> 01:39:41,339
just how much...

1153
01:40:49,342 --> 01:40:52,077
You'll never know...

1154
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:56,215
if you don't know now.

1155
01:41:18,705 --> 01:41:19,873
Elisa...

1156
01:41:22,176 --> 01:41:23,745
What is it, honey?

1157
01:41:50,436 --> 01:41:52,038
This isn't good.

1158
01:41:54,809 --> 01:41:56,744
I'm gonna call Dr. Hoffstetler.

1159
01:41:58,878 --> 01:42:00,747
We gotta release him
tonight, honey.

1160
01:42:01,414 --> 01:42:03,050
I'll come back and help you.

1161
01:42:27,473 --> 01:42:28,808
He's coming out.

1162
01:42:34,815 --> 01:42:36,447
Ah, fuck.

1163
01:42:41,021 --> 01:42:43,388
Sir, if you don't
mind me saying, you...

1164
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:44,758
you don't look so well.

1165
01:42:45,426 --> 01:42:46,794
Shut up.

1166
01:42:49,128 --> 01:42:51,095
Can you smell that?
I mean...

1167
01:42:51,097 --> 01:42:53,198
I think it's your fingers.
They're... they're...

1168
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:55,669
- Mmm.
- black.

1169
01:43:00,207 --> 01:43:02,041
There he is.

1170
01:43:02,043 --> 01:43:03,707
Doctor-fucking-shirtbird.

1171
01:43:03,709 --> 01:43:05,510
Oh, there's no cause
for cursing, sir.

1172
01:43:10,284 --> 01:43:12,253
Get out of the car.
I'm taking it.

1173
01:43:13,454 --> 01:43:14,685
This is my car.

1174
01:43:14,687 --> 01:43:16,220
Get the fuck out.

1175
01:43:16,222 --> 01:43:17,725
Out of my car?

1176
01:43:18,391 --> 01:43:19,993
Did I stutter?

1177
01:44:52,787 --> 01:44:54,219
Strickland! Thank God!

1178
01:44:54,221 --> 01:44:56,788
You were speaking Russian...

1179
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:57,855
Bob.

1180
01:45:09,735 --> 01:45:10,969
What's your name?

1181
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:13,804
- Hoffstetler.
- No, no. Don't lie.

1182
01:45:13,806 --> 01:45:15,105
You don't need to.

1183
01:45:15,107 --> 01:45:18,042
You took a bullet to the gut.

1184
01:45:18,044 --> 01:45:19,277
You're dead.

1185
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:20,879
I need the names, ranks

1186
01:45:20,881 --> 01:45:23,247
and location
of the entire strike team.

1187
01:45:23,249 --> 01:45:24,916
"Strike team?"

1188
01:45:24,918 --> 01:45:27,819
The ones who took the asset!

1189
01:45:36,629 --> 01:45:40,031
This candy.
It's cheap candy, but I love it.

1190
01:45:40,033 --> 01:45:42,834
Ever since I was a kid.

1191
01:45:42,836 --> 01:45:46,103
Now some folks favor
more sophisticated snacks,

1192
01:45:46,105 --> 01:45:49,573
nougat center
and all that foo-foo shit.

1193
01:45:49,575 --> 01:45:51,745
But not me, Bob!

1194
01:45:52,579 --> 01:45:53,914
This is it for me.

1195
01:45:56,783 --> 01:45:59,384
Now sometimes
if I'm feeling anxious,

1196
01:45:59,386 --> 01:46:00,426
I just bite right into it.

1197
01:46:01,154 --> 01:46:03,121
But mostly,

1198
01:46:03,123 --> 01:46:04,824
I take my time.

1199
01:46:05,325 --> 01:46:06,692
I make it last.

1200
01:46:11,998 --> 01:46:13,631
Names, ranks,

1201
01:46:13,633 --> 01:46:15,634
and location
of the strike team.

1202
01:46:19,338 --> 01:46:21,572
Names! Ranks! Now!

1203
01:46:26,245 --> 01:46:27,748
No names.

1204
01:46:29,016 --> 01:46:30,418
No ranks.

1205
01:46:31,251 --> 01:46:32,787
They...

1206
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:34,818
They just clean.

1207
01:46:46,031 --> 01:46:48,233
Alright, Brewster,
I'm gonna fix your dinner,

1208
01:46:48,235 --> 01:46:51,005
and then I'm gonna run out for a
little while and help a friend.

1209
01:46:52,405 --> 01:46:53,705
Help with what?

1210
01:46:53,707 --> 01:46:55,240
Help a friend.

1211
01:46:57,577 --> 01:46:59,410
Zelda...

1212
01:46:59,412 --> 01:47:00,847
the door.

1213
01:47:04,284 --> 01:47:06,917
Well, you could help me
and answer the door, Brewster.

1214
01:47:06,919 --> 01:47:09,187
You're sitting right here
just ten feet away from it!

1215
01:47:09,189 --> 01:47:11,055
My back's aching me, woman.
Now, move!

1216
01:47:11,057 --> 01:47:13,327
Your back, your back?
Always your back!

1217
01:47:16,562 --> 01:47:17,931
Mr. Strickland.

1218
01:47:18,664 --> 01:47:20,465
What are you doing here?

1219
01:47:20,467 --> 01:47:21,800
Who's that man, Zelda?

1220
01:47:21,802 --> 01:47:23,100
Where is it?

1221
01:47:23,102 --> 01:47:24,635
- What are you talking about?
- Where did you take it?

1222
01:47:24,637 --> 01:47:27,157
- What are you talking about? I... I don't...
- Zelda!

1223
01:47:28,742 --> 01:47:31,811
The thing in the lab.

1224
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:34,045
Where is it?

1225
01:47:34,047 --> 01:47:36,183
- Listen, fella...
- Sit down!

1226
01:47:45,592 --> 01:47:46,724
I'm sorry, sir.

1227
01:47:46,726 --> 01:47:49,162
If I knew anything,
I would surely tell you.

1228
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:55,770
That story about Samson.

1229
01:47:56,735 --> 01:47:58,870
I never told you how it ends.

1230
01:47:58,872 --> 01:48:03,444
After the Philistines
torture him and blind him...

1231
01:48:04,878 --> 01:48:08,082
Samson asks God
for the strength he needs.

1232
01:48:09,783 --> 01:48:12,884
And at the last minute,
he is spared.

1233
01:48:12,886 --> 01:48:17,656
And the Lord gives him
his strength back...

1234
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:19,026
one last time.

1235
01:48:21,695 --> 01:48:24,198
And he holds...

1236
01:48:25,065 --> 01:48:28,433
the columns of the temple...

1237
01:48:28,435 --> 01:48:29,901
with his powerful arms.

1238
01:48:29,903 --> 01:48:32,807
And he crushes them.

1239
01:48:44,284 --> 01:48:45,983
And he brings
the whole building

1240
01:48:45,985 --> 01:48:48,087
down on the Philistines.

1241
01:48:53,526 --> 01:48:55,026
He dies...

1242
01:48:55,028 --> 01:48:59,333
but he gets every single
one of those motherfuckers.

1243
01:48:59,932 --> 01:49:01,301
That is his will!

1244
01:49:05,271 --> 01:49:10,043
Now, do you know what that
particular story means...

1245
01:49:10,977 --> 01:49:13,478
for us, Delilah?

1246
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:15,947
It means if you know something
you're not telling me

1247
01:49:15,949 --> 01:49:17,916
you're gonna tell me

1248
01:49:17,918 --> 01:49:22,019
either before or after

1249
01:49:22,021 --> 01:49:24,425
I bring
this particular temple...

1250
01:49:25,758 --> 01:49:29,460
down upon our heads.

1251
01:49:29,462 --> 01:49:31,895
Gal stole that
thing right out the lab,

1252
01:49:31,897 --> 01:49:33,464
whatever it is.

1253
01:49:33,466 --> 01:49:35,832
Mute girl took it.

1254
01:49:35,834 --> 01:49:38,638
I heard my wife talking
on the phone about it.

1255
01:49:43,142 --> 01:49:45,443
Thank you very much,
Mr. Fuller,

1256
01:49:45,445 --> 01:49:47,247
for your assistance.

1257
01:49:58,359 --> 01:50:00,192
What have you done?

1258
01:50:00,194 --> 01:50:00,992
Zelda.

1259
01:50:00,994 --> 01:50:02,126
I gotta warn her.

1260
01:50:02,128 --> 01:50:03,827
He's going after her.

1261
01:50:03,829 --> 01:50:06,029
You will do
no such thing, woman.

1262
01:50:06,031 --> 01:50:07,365
Why are you worrying about her?

1263
01:50:07,367 --> 01:50:08,765
She broke the law.

1264
01:50:08,767 --> 01:50:10,937
Shut up, Brewster!
You shut up!

1265
01:50:11,637 --> 01:50:13,539
Years, you don't talk...

1266
01:50:14,908 --> 01:50:17,809
and now you can't
shut your mouth!

1267
01:50:17,811 --> 01:50:19,179
Damn you, Brewster.

1268
01:50:21,515 --> 01:50:23,415
You wouldn't understand.

1269
01:50:23,417 --> 01:50:27,885
Couldn't understand, not if
you tried your whole life.

1270
01:50:27,887 --> 01:50:30,020
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Giles, is that you?

1271
01:50:30,022 --> 01:50:32,025
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Okay. Put Elisa on the phone.

1272
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:33,627
It's Zelda.

1273
01:50:35,328 --> 01:50:38,362
Elisa, honey, make a sound
on the phone if you can hear.

1274
01:50:39,565 --> 01:50:40,566
<i>Okay, good.</i>

1275
01:50:41,234 --> 01:50:42,767
He's coming for you.

1276
01:50:42,769 --> 01:50:45,437
<i>You gotta go now, and you gotta
take that thing with you.</i>

1277
01:50:45,439 --> 01:50:46,539
What? Elisa?

1278
01:50:55,047 --> 01:50:57,650
Hey! Watch out!
Learn how to drive!

1279
01:51:27,681 --> 01:51:29,083
Damn it.

1280
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:42,261
We have to go.

1281
01:51:44,631 --> 01:51:46,296
Where are you?

1282
01:51:46,298 --> 01:51:47,898
Where the fuck are you?

1283
01:54:11,544 --> 01:54:13,346
I do not fail.

1284
01:54:14,980 --> 01:54:16,415
I deliver.

1285
01:54:21,555 --> 01:54:22,689
Elisa!

1286
01:54:23,890 --> 01:54:25,559
Elisa.

1287
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:35,369
No.

1288
01:55:23,550 --> 01:55:24,650
Fuck.

1289
01:55:25,851 --> 01:55:27,486
You are a god.

1290
01:56:01,887 --> 01:56:03,256
Look, man on the ground.

1291
01:56:04,089 --> 01:56:05,525
Watch him.

1292
01:56:12,364 --> 01:56:14,700
You there! Call an ambulance!

1293
01:57:34,513 --> 01:57:36,413
<i>If I told you about her,</i>

1294
01:57:36,415 --> 01:57:38,482
<i>what would I say?</i>

1295
01:57:38,484 --> 01:57:41,419
<i>That they lived
happily ever after?</i>

1296
01:57:41,421 --> 01:57:43,955
<i>I believe they did.</i>

1297
01:57:43,957 --> 01:57:47,959
<i>That they were in love,
that they remained in love?</i>

1298
01:57:47,961 --> 01:57:49,963
<i>I'm sure that's true.</i>

1299
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:52,799
<i>But when I think of her...</i>

1300
01:57:53,734 --> 01:57:55,934
<i>of Elisa...</i>

1301
01:57:55,936 --> 01:57:58,902
<i>the only thing that comes
to mind is a poem</i>

1302
01:57:58,904 --> 01:58:03,840
<i>whispered by someone in love,
hundreds of years ago.</i>

1303
01:58:03,842 --> 01:58:06,812
<i>"Unable to perceive
the shape of You</i>

1304
01:58:07,713 --> 01:58:10,548
<i>"I find You all around me</i>

1305
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:13,954
<i>"Your presence fills my eyes
with Your love</i>

1306
01:58:14,954 --> 01:58:17,254
<i>"It humbles my heart</i>

1307
01:58:17,256 --> 01:58:19,290
<i>For You are everywhere"</i>
