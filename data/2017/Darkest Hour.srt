1
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,419
Order!

2
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,296
Order! Order!

3
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,845
Mr. Speaker! Mr. Speaker!

4
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,978
Order!
The leader...

5
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,441
Order.

6
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,571
The leader of the Opposition,
Clement Attlee.

7
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,900
Mr. Speaker.

8
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:54,032
It seems that
I have not been clear enough.

9
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,580
Then let me leave no doubt

10
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:02,294
about my feelings regarding
Mr. Chamberlain's future

11
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,872
as prime minister.

12
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,207
All right,
honorable gentlemen!

13
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,213
Give way! Give way!

14
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,756
Give way!

15
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:15,089
Owing to his years of inactivity

16
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,507
and incompetence,

17
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:21,016
we find him personally responsible...

18
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,476
personally responsible
for leaving this nation

19
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,903
ruinously unprepared
to face the present Nazi peril.

20
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,989
- Order! Order!
- Sit down!

21
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,874
Shame on you! Shame!

22
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,622
We are at war, Mr. Speaker...

23
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:47,214
at war. And leaving aside
whether he is fit

24
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:52,382
to be a leader in peacetime,
he has proved himself incapable

25
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,474
of leading us in wartime!

26
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,256
Sit down!

27
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,974
Order! Order!

28
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,267
I said, "Order!"

29
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:11,654
Therefore, in the national interest,

30
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:16,114
we, the Opposition,
are willing to enter into

31
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:20,826
a grand coalition
with the ruling Conservative Party...

32
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,038
so-called...

33
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,120
- Order! Order!
- but not...

34
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,826
and I stress never...
under the leadership

35
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,787
of Mr. Chamberlain, who has lost

36
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,548
the confidence of this House.

37
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,804
In the country's interest, man,

38
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:41,394
resign, step down,
and let us find a new leader.

39
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,021
Sit down. Shame on you.

40
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,309
- Shame.
- You've got some nerve!

41
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,234
Where's Winston?

42
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,614
Ensuring his fingerprints
are not on the murder weapon.

43
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,570
Order!

44
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,780
As the Opposition refuse

45
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,656
to join any government headed by me,

46
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,254
we must now select my successor,

47
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,210
someone with new strength

48
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,291
to form a coalition government.

49
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,172
I will step down tomorrow,

50
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:22,007
but, I did want my own party,

51
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,425
the gentlemen I most respect,

52
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,144
to know first.

53
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,105
Yeah.

54
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:34,187
- And it must be Halifax.
- Hear, hear.

55
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,484
There's no question.

56
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,987
- Our foreign secretary.
- Halifax.

57
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,490
Yeah, of course.

58
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,779
No contest. Halifax.

59
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,076
Thank you, gentlemen.

60
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,553
I appreciate your confidence in me.

61
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,457
However, my time has not yet come.

62
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,582
Then who?

63
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,459
But, on whomever the task may fall,

64
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:58,135
he shall be required
to explore every avenue.

65
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,725
Including that of diplomatic talks.

66
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:05,351
Indeed. Towards the restoration
of peace in Europe.

67
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,680
- Absolutely.
- Hear, hear.

68
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,726
Well, gentlemen,
there is only one candidate...

69
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,061
only one man
the Opposition will accept.

70
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,647
- Oh, no. Oh, surely not.
- God, has it come to that?

71
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,903
No, no, no.

72
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,955
No, this is totally absurd.

73
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,045
And if he stretches out his hand

74
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,385
and says, "Gimme,"

75
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,209
you need to anticipate what he wants.

76
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,215
Black pen, red pen, paper

77
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,377
or "clop"... that's his hole punch.

78
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,178
How selfish to resign, time like this.

79
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,363
Do you think they'll take me

80
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,007
to Downing Street if he gets the job?

81
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,467
Not after that spotted dick
you served last week, eh?

82
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:53,268
He mumbles, so it's almost impossible
to catch everything.

83
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,863
Be prepared to type fast...
short bursts and double-spaced.

84
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,280
He hates single-spaced.
Hates it.

85
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,153
Good luck.

86
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,391
To the French ambassador.

87
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,017
With German forces...

88
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,099
crossing into Holland...

89
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,520
Holland alone...

90
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,442
Come on. Telegram.

91
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,444
Holland alone...

92
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,032
requests reassurance

93
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,821
that French forces will now move...

94
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,912
No, move at once.

95
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,409
Into, to protect Belgium.

96
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,167
Stop.

97
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,839
French ambassador, sir.

98
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,296
Monsieur Ambassador.

99
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:09,887
Oh.

100
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,138
They've already invaded Belgium?

101
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,726
Holland and Belgium?

102
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:23,864
I will convey your plea
to the prime minister at once.

103
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:29,408
Yes. The situation is still very confused.

104
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,752
Yes.

105
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,791
Good-bye.

106
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,958
"To the French ambassador.

107
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,229
- With German..."
- No, scrap that.

108
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,343
New telegram.

109
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,222
To General Ismay.

110
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,009
In...

111
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,182
- What is it now?
- Your son.

112
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,638
Randolph, quickly.

113
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,692
No, last night, they said

114
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,558
I might be made prime minister today,

115
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,725
but that-that was yesterday.

116
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,734
Let's see what happens today.

117
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,146
Yeah? Let's see what,

118
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,065
let's see what Neville does today.

119
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,195
Yes.

120
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,705
Thank you, my boy.

121
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,326
Yes.

122
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,623
Yes. Keep buggering on.

123
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,093
Where, now...

124
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,421
"To General Ismay."

125
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,166
Ah, General Ismay.

126
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,797
Yeah. Sawyers.

127
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,894
Get rid of this, will you?

128
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,021
To General Ismay.

129
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,984
In light of today's events,

130
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:46,615
the time is ripe...

131
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:52,365
for many preparations to be...

132
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,449
Are you

133
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,415
striking those keys
in a normal fashion?

134
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,116
It's awfully loud. I can't...
I can't hear myself think.

135
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,417
Read it back.

136
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,339
"To General Ismay.

137
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,009
In the light of today's events,
the time is right..."

138
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,549
"Ripe"! Not "right"!

139
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,553
God's teeth, girl.

140
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,555
I said "ripe"!

141
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,057
Ripe! Ripe!

142
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,308
Last sentence.

143
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,230
"The time is ripe." Puh.

144
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,809
- For...
- "For..."

145
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,944
- For...
- "Man-Many, many, many..."

146
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,441
Many, many, many, many, many.

147
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,363
How many "many" s did you write,
you nincompoop?

148
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,362
One "many." For...

149
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:33,624
"For many preparations to be made."

150
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:38,204
Single-spaced. Single-spaced!

151
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,583
Were you not briefed, young lady?

152
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:41,874
Single-spaced!

153
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:43,827
Someone set it on single-space, and...

154
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,127
Then why did you persist?

155
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,590
- Well, I...
- Oh, goddamn! Tell...

156
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,211
Tell Evans to send me someone

157
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,878
who can get it right the first time!

158
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,257
Go on! Out!

159
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,221
"Right"!

160
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,767
He shouted at you.

161
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,614
- Did he shout at you?
- No.

162
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,321
- He can be an awful brute!
- I'm...

163
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,729
- I made too many mistakes.
- I think you were nervous,

164
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,462
and he has a knack
for drawing out the very worst

165
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,797
in those who are trying
to help him the most.

166
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:13,882
No, no, it's not... It's not him.

167
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:15,026
It's me. He's... he's...

168
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,235
He's a man, like any other.

169
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,159
Come on. What you doing?

170
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,576
Dearest.

171
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,714
The War Cabinet's been called.

172
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,842
- Bloody cat's under the bed again.
- My darling?

173
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,564
- Tango.
- May I tell you something

174
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,258
I feel you really ought to know?

175
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:38,389
I have noticed a recent
deterioration in your manner.

176
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,642
You're not as kind as you used to be.

177
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,929
You've become rough.

178
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,727
And sarcastic and overbearing and rude.

179
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,482
Oh, is this about the new girl?

180
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:50,335
If the king does ask you
to become prime minister...

181
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,689
We don't know that for sure.

182
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,197
I don't want you to be disliked.

183
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,159
More than I already am?

184
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,080
My darling, you are on the brink

185
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,950
of having tremendous power,

186
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,437
surpassed only by that of the king,

187
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:06,827
and with such power
you really must try and be more kind.

188
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,998
And, if possible, calm.

189
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,260
I want others to love
and respect you, as I do.

190
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:28,232
Telegram for Mr. Churchill.

191
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,863
Excuse me?

192
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:31,649
I'm not...

193
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:52,129
...troops have
destroyed all bridges

194
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,802
of the Isle and Meuse rivers.

195
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,882
This is the BBC Home Service.

196
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:00,724
Here is a short news bulletin.

197
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,814
The German army invaded

198
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,941
Holland and Belgium
early this morning, by land...

199
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,496
- There's a telegram.
- ...and by landings

200
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,940
from parachutes.

201
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:12,362
The armies of the Low Countries

202
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:13,781
are resisting.

203
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,109
An appeal for help has been made

204
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:17,705
to the Allied governments...

205
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,579
- It's from the Palace.
- ...and Brussels says

206
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:23,076
that Allied troops
are moving to their support.

207
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:27,576
A hundred war planes
were seen over Brussels,

208
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,544
and it is now reported

209
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,005
that in the first raid over Brussels,

210
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,705
several hundred people
were killed and wounded,

211
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:38,427
and several buildings destroyed.

212
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,849
Five minutes ago,

213
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,929
the Air Ministry announced

214
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,474
that in the early hours of this morning...

215
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:49,938
Thank you, Miss?

216
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,807
Layton.

217
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,648
- You're shaking.
- So are you.

218
00:12:56,735 --> 00:13:00,155
You... you from excitement,
I from terror.

219
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:02,739
You've wanted this your entire adult life.

220
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,794
No. Since the nursery.
But do the public want me?

221
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,139
It's your own party to whom
you'll have to prove yourself.

222
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:11,423
I'm getting the job only
because the ship is sinking.

223
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,090
It-It's not a gift, it's revenge.

224
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,759
Let them see your true qualities,
your courage.

225
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,009
- My poor judgment.
- No, your lack of vanity.

226
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:21,091
- And my iron will.
- Your sense of humor.

227
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,506
Ho, ho, ho.

228
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,929
Now go.

229
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:27,394
- Go?
- Be...

230
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,524
Be what?

231
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,020
Be yourself.

232
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,018
Myself?

233
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,566
Which self should I

234
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,494
be today?

235
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,664
One should have had power
when a young man.

236
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,243
When wits were sharp.

237
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,788
Sinews strong.

238
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,212
Oh, well.

239
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,040
Lead on, Macduff.

240
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,092
When youth departs,

241
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:59,007
may wisdom prove enough.

242
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:53,312
Hardly seems like there's a war on at all.

243
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,900
Do you know I've never ridden a bus?

244
00:14:58,732 --> 00:14:59,902
Sir?

245
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,244
I've never queued for bread.

246
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,112
I believe I can boil an egg.

247
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,660
But only because I've seen it done.

248
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,749
The only time I tried
riding the Underground

249
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,670
was during the General Strike.

250
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,959
Clemmie dropped me off
at South Kensington station.

251
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,304
I went down but got lost.

252
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,010
I came straight back up!

253
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,721
It was awful.

254
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:30,011
Why not Halifax? I favor Halifax.

255
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,427
I wanted Halifax.

256
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,599
The Lords wanted Halifax.

257
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,979
Perhaps, Halifax wanted Halifax.

258
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,651
Then why have I been forced
to send for Churchill?

259
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,651
Because he is the only
member of our party

260
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,695
who has the support of the Opposition.

261
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:49,159
His record is a litany of catastrophe.

262
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,410
Gallipoli, 25,000 dead,

263
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:55,084
the India policy, the Russian Civil War,

264
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:56,752
the Gold Standard,

265
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:02,252
the abdication
and now this Norway adventure.

266
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,797
What's that, 1,800 men?

267
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:06,381
One aircraft carrier, two cruisers,

268
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,676
seven destroyers and a submarine.

269
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,220
- Winston lacks judgment.
- He was right about Hitler.

270
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:15,136
Well, even a stopped clock
is right twice a day.

271
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,189
First Lord of the Admiralty,
Mr. Winston Churchill.

272
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:23,324
Early.

273
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:24,567
Keen.

274
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,695
I accept your resignation,

275
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,948
but I want you to know how...

276
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,828
cruelly I think you've been treated.

277
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:39,922
Thank you, Your Majesty.

278
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,546
Oh, this way, My Lord.

279
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,339
Your Majesty.

280
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,670
Mr. Churchill.

281
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,339
I believe you know

282
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,719
why I have asked you here today.

283
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:36,474
Sir, I simply cannot imagine why.

284
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,861
It is my duty to invite you

285
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:46,359
to take up the position of prime minister

286
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,321
of this United Kingdom.

287
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,815
Will you form a government?

288
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:53,034
I will.

289
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:54,572
Very well.

290
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,590
Well, that was quite easy.

291
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,298
Yes, it was.

292
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:23,019
I believe we are to meet regularly.

293
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,356
Once a week, I'm afraid.

294
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,479
How is...

295
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,192
How are you for Mondays?

296
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,531
I shall endeavor to be available

297
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,414
- on Mondays.
- 4:00?

298
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,160
I nap at 4:00.

299
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,162
Is that permissible?

300
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,326
No. But necessary.

301
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:44,535
I work late.

302
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,635
Then perhaps lunchtime.

303
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,342
Lunch?

304
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,344
Mondays?

305
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,839
Your Majesty.

306
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:57,178
Prime Minister.

307
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:25,714
- Can we get any closer?
- Mr. Churchill!

308
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,088
Good evening, gentlemen.

309
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,563
Mr. Churchill, welcome to Number Ten.

310
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:31,877
Thank you, sir.

311
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:33,674
Mr. Churchill, what's your agenda?

312
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:37,297
The agenda? A glass of Pol Roger.

313
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,176
- Cheers.
- Over here, sir!

314
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,643
You'll-you'll have your pictures.

315
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,022
Prime Minister.

316
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:43,309
Anthony.

317
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,142
How is the king?

318
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,597
Anxious.

319
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,270
He's never forgiven me for supporting

320
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,821
his brother's marriage to Wallis Simpson.

321
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,862
You only have to meet him once a week.

322
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,946
Oh, but that's like saying
you only have to have

323
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,081
your tooth pulled once a week.

324
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:03,038
Composition of your War Cabinet.

325
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,750
Who should sit on it?

326
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,960
Yeah.

327
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,249
Chamberlain, of course.

328
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:12,296
The Reverend Holy Fox.

329
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,014
Halifax.

330
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,682
Keeping your enemies close?

331
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,338
Oh, more than that.

332
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,510
Without them, the party
will have rid of me.

333
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:24,717
Oh, and that sheep
in sheep's clothing, Attlee.

334
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,599
Come on, Daddy. Everyone's waiting.

335
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:30,516
Yes, I'll be there in a jiffy, my love.

336
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,731
I heard that before you were asked,

337
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,397
they offered it to Lord Halifax.

338
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:36,855
Oh, I doubt that.

339
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:39,824
Halifax would never turn it down.

340
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:42,487
He's the fourth son of an earl.

341
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,366
Fourth sons turn nothing down.

342
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:49,295
I wish the position had come
your way in better times, sir.

343
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,311
You have an enormous task ahead of you.

344
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,667
I only hope it's not too late.

345
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,594
I'm very much afraid it is.

346
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:01,136
But we can only do our best, hmm?

347
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:04,395
- Hip hip!
- Hurray!

348
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:05,643
Oh, heavens!

349
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:07,644
What a frightful sight.

350
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:09,766
- A toast.
- Yes, a speech.

351
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:11,895
- Yes.
- Mama.

352
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:14,692
Yes.

353
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,995
My darling husband.

354
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:20,109
Some of you may not know that on the eve

355
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:22,447
of our marriage, I got cold feet.

356
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:25,333
But as I'd already
called off two engagements

357
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,170
by the age of 21
and was in danger of gaining

358
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:28,544
a reputation for being a bolter

359
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,122
it would have been poor form

360
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,957
- to call off a third.
- Hear, hear.

361
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,382
Lucky for Daddy.

362
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,710
But the real reason for my wintery feet

363
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:38,466
was that I knew, even then,

364
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:41,301
that his priority would be public life.

365
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:44,197
But it worried a young girl greatly,

366
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:46,641
this wretched thought
of eternally coming second.

367
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,926
But so it has proven to be.

368
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:52,596
And in due course, our children
would have to make their peace

369
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,058
with this same fact.

370
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,280
We all did, you see.

371
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:00,201
In our own way.

372
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:08,285
And now, today,
we are to receive our reward.

373
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:11,458
Proof that our small sacrifice

374
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,710
was for a far, far greater good.

375
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,295
I give you your father,

376
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:22,263
my beloved husband, the Prime Minister.

377
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:24,467
The Prime Minister.

378
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,642
Here's to,

379
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:31,728
to not buggering it up.

380
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,730
To not buggering it up.

381
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,019
Belgium was a ploy.

382
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:40,194
They punched through
the Ardennes into France.

383
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:43,237
Crossed the Meuse River in under 24 hours.

384
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:45,242
No one can cross the Meuse in 24 hours.

385
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:46,744
Well, apparently the Germans can.

386
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,115
Look to Chamberlain's handkerchief.

387
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:25,865
If he waves it
at the end of Churchill's speech,

388
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:27,368
we show approval.

389
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,332
If not, keep quiet.

390
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,462
The Prime Minister.

391
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,297
Here we go.

392
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:50,679
Mr. Speaker,

393
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:54,602
on Friday evening last,

394
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:58,103
I received His Majesty's commission

395
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:01,018
to form a new administration.

396
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:05,321
It was the evident wish and will

397
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:08,414
of Parliament and the nation

398
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:13,700
that this should be conceived
on the broadest possible basis.

399
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:16,537
And that it should include all parties.

400
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:18,083
Hear, hear.

401
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:22,381
A War Cabinet has been convened.

402
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:26,222
No. Correction.

403
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,180
Has been formed.

404
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,095
"Formed."

405
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:35,735
A War Cabinet has been formed
of five members

406
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,149
representing, with the Opposition parties,

407
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,440
the unity of the nation.

408
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:45,316
Read.

409
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:47,172
"The three
party leaders have agreed

410
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:48,946
"to serve either in the War Cabinet

411
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:51,621
"or in high executive office."

412
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,660
With this agreement in place,

413
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:56,915
I now invite the House

414
00:24:56,997 --> 00:25:00,667
by the resolution which
stands in my name...

415
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:04,094
...to record its approval

416
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:07,918
and to declare its confidence

417
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:09,338
in the new government.

418
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:13,684
Miss?

419
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:17,313
I'm coming out in a state of nature.

420
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:25,319
It must be remembered

421
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:28,778
that we are in the preliminary stage

422
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:32,622
of one of the greatest battles in history.

423
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:37,625
And that many preparations
have to be made here at home.

424
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:39,084
Hear, hear.

425
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:41,544
Sir, I take up my task

426
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,635
with a buoyancy and hope,

427
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:48,545
and say to the House, as I have said

428
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:50,512
to those who have joined the government,

429
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:54,009
I have nothing to offer

430
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:58,731
but blood, toil, tears and sweat.

431
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:05,324
We have before us an ordeal
of the most grievous kind.

432
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:09,573
We have before us many, many long months

433
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:12,283
of struggle and of suffering.

434
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:16,118
You ask, "What is our policy?"

435
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,619
I say it is to wage war

436
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:23,335
by sea, land and air

437
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,167
with all our might

438
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:29,797
and with all the strength
that God can give us.

439
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:36,255
To wage war against a monstrous tyranny

440
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:39,850
never surpassed
in the dark and lamentable catalog

441
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:41,483
of human crime.

442
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,980
That is our policy.

443
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:48,479
Oh, you ask, "What is our aim?"

444
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:52,243
I can answer in one word.

445
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:54,994
Victory.

446
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:57,533
Victory at all costs.

447
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:01,373
Victory, in spite of all terror.

448
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:06,465
Victory, however long and hard
the road may be.

449
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:09,554
For without victory,

450
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:13,215
there can be no survival.

451
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:30,691
What's he doing?

452
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:40,875
Contempt.

453
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,290
We have to start somewhere.

454
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:45,538
Snap.

455
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:57,216
"Our policy is to wage war.

456
00:27:57,636 --> 00:27:59,136
"At all costs.

457
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:00,891
"No survival."

458
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:02,183
Good God, he's incapable

459
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:04,886
of even pronouncing the word "peace,"

460
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:07,483
let alone entering into negotiations.

461
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:10,824
Awful, the thought that I shall never see

462
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,819
my country at peace again.

463
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:17,736
I have cancer.

464
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:23,910
Oh, Neville.

465
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:32,131
Winston must be removed from office.

466
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,512
If we can get him
to declare that he refuses

467
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,090
to even consider peace
negotiations with Germany,

468
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:40,096
you and I would perhaps
have clear grounds to resign.

469
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,560
That would force
a vote of no confidence.

470
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,480
The party couldn't countenance that.

471
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,309
You're the chairman, for heaven's sake.

472
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:49,352
He'd be finished.

473
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:52,068
And you would agree to be prime minister.

474
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:54,226
Well...

475
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,695
with Winston out of the way,
who can say?

476
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:00,029
But the important thing, Neville,

477
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:03,575
is that your policies
would be back on the table.

478
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,250
Peace and the protection of our nation.

479
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,750
On record.

480
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,171
I beg your pardon.

481
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:10,419
He must declare, on record,

482
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:13,881
his refusal to engage in peace talks.

483
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:16,379
We must have it in writing.

484
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:57,418
Thank you.

485
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:00,931
- Miss Layton.
- Morning.

486
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:02,391
Follow me.

487
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:17,154
Morning.

488
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:18,784
Thank you, sir.

489
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:21,492
Thank you, ma'am.

490
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:25,204
What goes on down here?

491
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:28,204
That's need-to-know, and you don't.

492
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:30,657
- The lavatory?
- For the PM's use only.

493
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:32,753
Sleeping quarters,

494
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,833
for when you miss the last train.

495
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:37,555
Ma'am.

496
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:41,803
That's the Map Room.

497
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:44,756
- No women allowed.
- What department's this?

498
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:47,015
Indiscretion in conversation
or any other form,

499
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:49,117
within or without these rooms
regarding what happens here,

500
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:51,771
is a statutory offense punishable by up to

501
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:54,192
two years imprisonment with hard labor.

502
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:56,115
Clear?

503
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,360
Crystal.

504
00:30:57,441 --> 00:30:58,481
Good.

505
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:01,572
That's the War Cabinet room.

506
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:03,147
Never.

507
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:07,665
I don't mean to be rough on you, but

508
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:09,873
them's the rules.

509
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:13,255
This is the typists' pool.

510
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,503
- Good morning, sir.
- Ladies.

511
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:18,844
And here's you.

512
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:29,098
Belgium and Holland may fall at any hour.

513
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:30,561
And the French?

514
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:32,061
The entire French Ninth Army,

515
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:34,732
some 200,000 men, have capitulated.

516
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:36,437
All of them?

517
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:37,692
Capitulated.

518
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:39,693
Deserted. It was a rout.

519
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:42,655
All our land forces,
roughly 300,000 men,

520
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,066
are now in full retreat.

521
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,610
Air cover? For our troops?

522
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:48,578
The Luftwaffe control the skies.

523
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:51,119
We simply don't have enough
planes to challenge them.

524
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:53,413
In fact, I strongly
recommend we stop sending

525
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:56,367
our precious fighter planes
to be wasted in France.

526
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,288
Save them for our own defense.

527
00:31:58,502 --> 00:32:01,342
And our navy sits idle,

528
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:03,591
neutralized, useless.

529
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:06,134
Our fleets no sooner
come within their range

530
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:08,178
than we come under blistering air attack.

531
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:12,312
Well, their speed is devastating.

532
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:15,641
Panzer tanks moving rapidly westward
through the center.

533
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:19,807
Well, they will have to pause
for fuel supplies.

534
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:21,478
This is not the last war, sir.

535
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:24,487
Their tanks can stop for fuel
at a petrol station.

536
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,156
Petrol station?

537
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:29,739
The road to Paris now lies open.

538
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:32,165
Seven million refugees are on the move.

539
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:35,575
Collectively, we are looking
at the collapse

540
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:37,964
of Western Europe in the next few days.

541
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:40,421
Should the public be told?

542
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:48,087
Not yet.

543
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:51,474
First, we must rouse our old friends

544
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:54,145
to a heroic resistance.

545
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:57,942
France must be saved.

546
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:04,588
Premier.

547
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:33,818
Perhaps, in English, Prime Minister.

548
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:35,451
Well...

549
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:40,044
We have survived crises before,

550
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:43,962
and I am... I am confident
we will survive this one.

551
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:47,422
Tell me how you plan to counter-attack.

552
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:50,588
There is no plan.

553
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:54,512
Well...

554
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:56,546
Well, you must counter-attack.

555
00:34:57,181 --> 00:34:59,181
Well, you must.

556
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:11,741
I do not
believe that this,

557
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:15,372
Panzer breakthrough is a real invasion.

558
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,409
Not a real invasion?

559
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:20,752
No. As long as their tank crews
are not supported

560
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:23,619
by infantry units, they are

561
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:27,749
merely little flags stuck on a map.

562
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:31,166
Because the tank crews
cannot support themselves.

563
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:33,426
No. I refuse to see,

564
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:36,799
in this spectacular raid
of the German tank,

565
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:39,005
a real invasion.

566
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:52,995
He's an actor,

567
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,200
in love with the sound of his own voice.

568
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,320
I love to listen to him.

569
00:35:57,783 --> 00:35:59,873
But we must never take his advice.

570
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,195
Has a hundred ideas a day.

571
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:03,747
Four of them are good,

572
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:06,082
the other 96 downright dangerous.

573
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:10,086
His father was the same.
Great orator, but...

574
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,960
Until he lost his mind to syphilis.

575
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:15,471
How nations suffer
for the sins of their fathers.

576
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:16,761
My opinion?

577
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:19,394
At this critical juncture for the empire,

578
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:23,015
we have a drunkard at the wheel.

579
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:25,482
Wakes with a scotch,

580
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:28,479
bottle of champagne for lunch,

581
00:36:28,564 --> 00:36:30,154
another one at dinner.

582
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:33,783
Brandy and port until the wee hours.

583
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:36,698
I wouldn't let him borrow my bicycle.

584
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,620
He's a Conservative
who defects to the Liberals,

585
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,240
lobs grenades at us for ten years,

586
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:45,957
then flops Conservative again
as it bloody suits him.

587
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:49,169
Sorry, but he stands for one thing.

588
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:50,504
Himself.

589
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:53,673
We may have to replace him, Bertie.

590
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:56,422
Replace him?

591
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,930
We must strive for peace

592
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:01,599
so that every
son and daughter of this land

593
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,260
can emerge from this crisis

594
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:05,558
with something recognizable as home.

595
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:09,602
Spoken like a true prime minister.

596
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:26,915
"V for Victory."

597
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:31,212
You need to reply to the Lord Privy Seal.

598
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:38,466
Tell the Lord Privy Seal
I am sealed in the privy.

599
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:42,796
And I can only deal
with one shit at a time.

600
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:54,145
The broadcast is tonight,
so don't spare me, Anthony.

601
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:55,785
Be frank.

602
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:05,696
I don't think so.

603
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:07,946
You don't think so what?

604
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:10,497
You're suggesting we're somehow winning.

605
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:12,166
We're not.

606
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:16,631
No, but it will inspire them.

607
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,170
- Winston, I know...
- Anthony, Anthony.

608
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:22,638
I am going to imbue them with a...

609
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,889
a spirit of feeling
they don't yet know they have.

610
00:38:26,974 --> 00:38:28,314
You asked my opinion.

611
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:31,268
I caution against it.

612
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:34,814
Cicero.

613
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,069
Cicero!

614
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:45,785
"If fortune is adverse..." something,

615
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:48,198
something, something.

616
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:55,207
Well...

617
00:38:55,711 --> 00:38:58,801
Well, it's not there. I left it there.

618
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:00,471
Clemmie!

619
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:02,381
Cat!

620
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:03,637
Clemmie!

621
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:04,929
We cannot pay our bills.

622
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:07,602
My copy of Cicero.

623
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:09,450
- Did-did you shelve it?
- Did you hear what I said?

624
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:10,814
- What was that?
- We're broke.

625
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:14,556
Oh, um... Out! Out.

626
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:16,396
Come on. Everybody out.

627
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:19,111
I dare not write another check.

628
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,990
Well, I'll economize.

629
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:24,737
Only four cigars a day.

630
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:26,703
You are insufferable!

631
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:32,253
Is there anything else?

632
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:34,246
Yes.

633
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,463
My love for you.

634
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:38,138
How much have you had
to drink this morning?

635
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:41,878
I see you now

636
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,879
as I first saw you

637
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:47,763
in 1904.

638
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:50,266
And I simply stood, speechless.

639
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:51,829
Well, I must have been very beautiful

640
00:39:51,892 --> 00:39:53,272
to achieve that miraculous effect.

641
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:56,022
Four years until we saw each other again.

642
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:57,314
Went by in an absolute flash.

643
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:59,267
You didn't lack for admirers.

644
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:03,488
Your fidele serviteur in Sidney Peel.

645
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,360
- Brilliant man.
- Lionel Earle.

646
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:07,407
Wonderful dancer.

647
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:11,195
And then at
Lady St. Helier's dinner party.

648
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:13,412
Who should show up?

649
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:15,711
Pig.

650
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:19,502
Just the same.

651
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,059
Are we terribly old?

652
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:34,353
Yes, I'm afraid you are.

653
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:36,558
Oh, you beast.

654
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:38,735
Oh, you...

655
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:44,111
Would you hear me read my speech

656
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:45,824
for tonight's broadcast?

657
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:48,157
Prime Minister.

658
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,717
Prime Minister, the situation in France.

659
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:51,951
Is it true we're in full retreat?

660
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:53,655
Is France lost?

661
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:03,548
"The Spanish ships I cannot see,

662
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,300
"for they are out of sight."

663
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:07,971
If you will sit here

664
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:10,432
at your desk.

665
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:14,684
And speak slowly and clearly.

666
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:17,061
Into the microphone.

667
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:18,905
So...

668
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:22,646
if you're ready, on the stroke of 9:00,

669
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:24,483
the red light will come on,

670
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:26,648
and we shall go live to the nation.

671
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:31,156
9:00, red light...

672
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:33,992
you begin.

673
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:35,407
Yes?

674
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:37,371
One moment.

675
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:47,376
Prime Minister, are we ready?

676
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:51,046
One moment, one moment.

677
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:58,765
We are going live...

678
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:00,402
One moment, damn you!

679
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:10,606
And four, three,

680
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,951
two, one.

681
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,770
I speak to you for the first time

682
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:38,679
as prime minister

683
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:43,811
in a solemn hour
for the life of our country,

684
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:48,230
of our empire, of our allies

685
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:52,611
and, above all, of the cause of freedom.

686
00:42:53,949 --> 00:42:55,699
A tremendous battle

687
00:42:55,784 --> 00:42:59,454
is raging in France and Flanders.

688
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:04,829
The Germans, by a remarkable combination

689
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:09,299
of air bombing and heavily armored tanks,

690
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:12,757
have broken through the French defenses

691
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:15,723
north of the Maginot Line

692
00:43:16,013 --> 00:43:17,473
and strong columns

693
00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:18,926
of their armored vehicles

694
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:21,886
are ravaging the open country...

695
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:25,107
...which, for the first day or two,

696
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,270
was without defenders.

697
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:33,697
However, I have invincible confidence

698
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:37,744
in the French Army and its leaders.

699
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:40,946
Only a very small part
of that splendid army

700
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:43,418
has yet been heavily engaged,

701
00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:48,958
and only a very small part
of France has yet been invaded.

702
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:50,923
Side by side,

703
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:55,265
the British and French peoples
have advanced.

704
00:43:55,344 --> 00:43:58,474
- "Advanced"?
- To rescue not only Europe.

705
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:01,635
- How bloody dare he.
- But mankind

706
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:06,395
from the foulest and most
soul-destroying tyranny

707
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:09,023
which has ever darkened

708
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:11,937
and stained the pages of history.

709
00:44:12,528 --> 00:44:16,198
But now one bond unites us all.

710
00:44:16,782 --> 00:44:21,162
To wage war until victory is won,

711
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:24,295
and never to surrender ourselves

712
00:44:24,915 --> 00:44:28,045
to servitude and shame.

713
00:44:28,126 --> 00:44:29,706
Whatever the cost

714
00:44:31,296 --> 00:44:32,956
and the agony may be,

715
00:44:33,674 --> 00:44:36,134
conquer we must,

716
00:44:36,802 --> 00:44:39,602
as conquer we shall.

717
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:47,603
Well done, sir.

718
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:57,303
Oh! I thought you did marvelously.

719
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,470
The last ten years,

720
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:01,891
I was the only one
who told them the truth.

721
00:46:02,471 --> 00:46:03,971
Until tonight.

722
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:07,272
There is no advance.

723
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:11,233
It's a shambles.

724
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:14,362
We're in full retreat.

725
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:18,027
But would you be serving them tonight

726
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,701
by denying them their sleep

727
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,660
and terrifying their children?

728
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:24,027
What, even if the terror is coming?

729
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:25,907
Because the terror is coming.

730
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:29,581
There's time enough for the truth.

731
00:46:39,591 --> 00:46:41,221
Have you seen this?

732
00:46:45,222 --> 00:46:47,182
What's so funny?

733
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:50,639
Prime Minister. Sir.

734
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:51,977
Yes, what is it?

735
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:54,812
Perhaps...

736
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,690
Look, I'm...

737
00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:02,028
I'm not sure if you know this, but,

738
00:47:03,156 --> 00:47:05,236
but the way you're doing
your "V for Victory" sign...

739
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:09,164
Well, in the poorer quarters,

740
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:10,964
that gesture means something else.

741
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:12,499
What does it mean?

742
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,043
Well, I wouldn't like to say, sir.

743
00:47:14,126 --> 00:47:16,416
I was captured by the Boer.

744
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:18,963
I spent time in a South African prison.

745
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:20,630
Up your bum.

746
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:23,049
Sir.

747
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,430
Up your bum?

748
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:27,136
Up your...

749
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:32,688
The way you're doing it, sir, yes, sir.

750
00:47:34,062 --> 00:47:36,362
But if you turn it around, that's fine.

751
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:39,905
I wouldn't like millions of people

752
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:41,155
to take it the wrong way.

753
00:47:41,236 --> 00:47:42,606
Indeed.

754
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:44,698
- Sir.
- Sir.

755
00:47:45,616 --> 00:47:48,906
And up your bum!

756
00:47:49,036 --> 00:47:50,116
Your Majesty.

757
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:52,831
Don't want to take
too much of your time.

758
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:55,377
I heard you on the wireless.

759
00:47:56,543 --> 00:47:58,253
Was I comprehensible?

760
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:03,216
The public need to be led, not misled.

761
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,010
Not left to work it out for themselves.

762
00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:11,016
Right.

763
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:13,391
Will that be all, Your Majesty?

764
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:14,644
Yes.

765
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:16,148
Good day, Prime Minister.

766
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,440
Good day.

767
00:48:20,943 --> 00:48:25,163
I believe I have just received
a royal rap on the knuckles.

768
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:33,372
As of 20:00 hours last night,

769
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:36,825
the Germans have encircled 60 British,

770
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:38,997
Belgian and French divisions.

771
00:48:40,212 --> 00:48:43,972
On our part, all our forces
under Lord Gort have withdrawn

772
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:47,009
or are trying to withdraw
to the French coast, to Dunkirk,

773
00:48:47,344 --> 00:48:49,144
where we cannot reach them.

774
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:50,851
How many of our men are trapped?

775
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:52,311
All of them.

776
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:55,266
Our country's entire
professional soldiery.

777
00:48:55,686 --> 00:48:58,056
And we can see no clear way
to rescue them.

778
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:04,238
General, are you telling me

779
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:08,369
that we shall have lost
the entire British Army

780
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:09,988
by the next few days?

781
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:12,083
That's correct.

782
00:49:12,828 --> 00:49:16,158
The German force
is superior in every regard

783
00:49:16,248 --> 00:49:18,208
and only 50 miles from the coast.

784
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:20,502
They are pushing us into the sea.

785
00:49:20,586 --> 00:49:23,956
No, the Germans must not reach the sea.

786
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:27,843
Not before we evacuate our men.

787
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:29,836
Ismay, what have you got for us?

788
00:49:29,928 --> 00:49:31,258
As it stands, I cannot see

789
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:35,056
we have much hope of getting
any of our forces out in time.

790
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:38,307
Not a man?

791
00:49:39,771 --> 00:49:42,441
Well, we... Well, we cannot be so

792
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:44,191
totally at their mercy.

793
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:45,816
What's our next step?

794
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:47,985
Anyone?

795
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:50,162
Come on, speak!

796
00:49:53,327 --> 00:49:54,721
We still have a garrison at Calais.

797
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:56,005
25 miles to the west.

798
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,659
Well, how many men do we have there?

799
00:49:57,748 --> 00:49:59,078
4,000, more or less.

800
00:50:01,793 --> 00:50:04,213
Then why... Why didn't you say so?

801
00:50:05,255 --> 00:50:08,585
Yes. Then we... We have them go east,

802
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:11,045
engage with the German columns
moving on Dunkirk,

803
00:50:11,136 --> 00:50:12,296
buy us some time.

804
00:50:12,387 --> 00:50:14,967
Draw the... the Nazi focus

805
00:50:15,057 --> 00:50:17,887
away from Dunkirk whilst we execute a...

806
00:50:17,976 --> 00:50:20,346
a maritime evacuation of our forces.

807
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:21,897
Is that possible?

808
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,360
It would mean a huge sacrifice.

809
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,360
4,000 young men.

810
00:50:25,442 --> 00:50:28,402
To save 300,000.

811
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:31,107
Under whose command
is the Calais garrison?

812
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:32,568
Brigadier Nicholson.

813
00:50:32,658 --> 00:50:33,908
Very well.

814
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:37,406
Tell Nicholson it is
of the greatest importance

815
00:50:37,496 --> 00:50:39,206
to this island that...

816
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:42,379
that his garrison draw the enemy's tanks

817
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:44,669
and artillery and bombers
away from Dunkirk.

818
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:46,923
Invite their wrath, and...

819
00:50:48,674 --> 00:50:50,184
Well, and to fight on

820
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:52,970
if needs be.

821
00:50:56,682 --> 00:51:00,392
If needs be,
until the destruction of his command.

822
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:04,775
It's suicide.

823
00:51:16,577 --> 00:51:20,287
Prime Minister, I have reservations.

824
00:51:20,914 --> 00:51:23,464
Well, who is free of reservations?

825
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:25,747
About unnecessary sacrifice,

826
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:27,801
when there is an available alternative.

827
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:30,763
What alternative?

828
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,640
Italy has offered to mediate peace talks

829
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:35,598
between ourselves and Germany.

830
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:36,929
I already indicated that,

831
00:51:37,014 --> 00:51:38,366
provided the liberty and independence

832
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:39,970
of the British Empire was assured,

833
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,479
we would consider any proposal.

834
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:47,321
With, with Hitler holding the whip hand.

835
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:49,029
Do you really think he would honor

836
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:50,319
our liberty and independence?

837
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:52,744
It would be in his interest to do so, sir.

838
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:55,243
- Because the British Empire...
- The only thing to do

839
00:51:55,324 --> 00:51:58,244
is to show that maniac

840
00:51:58,327 --> 00:52:00,367
that he cannot conquer this island,

841
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:02,084
and for that we need an army.

842
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:03,474
General, tell Brigadier Nicholson

843
00:52:03,498 --> 00:52:04,958
the Germans must not reach the sea.

844
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:07,922
Not before we-we get our boys

845
00:52:08,003 --> 00:52:10,053
off of that bloody beach!

846
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,920
I take full responsibility.

847
00:52:12,007 --> 00:52:13,257
Really?

848
00:52:13,342 --> 00:52:15,262
Really! Yes, sir.

849
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:16,724
It is the reason

850
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:19,223
I sit in this chair!

851
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:23,984
Well, surely, before you take

852
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:26,731
full responsibility
for the deaths of 4,000 men,

853
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:30,113
you'd wish to consider
every available avenue.

854
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:34,859
What is this?

855
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:39,203
What is your mind
on the principle of peace talks, sir?

856
00:52:43,038 --> 00:52:46,168
Do we take it, for example,
that you preclude yourself

857
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:49,790
from even considering
taking part in such negotiations?

858
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:13,440
I should like to speak to Viscount Halifax

859
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:15,357
and Mr. Chamberlain.

860
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:17,321
Alone.

861
00:53:18,156 --> 00:53:20,986
Issue the order to the Calais garrison.

862
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:23,580
Confirm it has been done.

863
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:25,327
Dismissed.

864
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:28,747
Now, you two come on.

865
00:53:28,834 --> 00:53:30,044
Out.

866
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:33,169
Bridges!

867
00:53:33,255 --> 00:53:34,885
You come on, hop it!

868
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:36,475
Out. Out!

869
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:46,659
Winston,

870
00:54:47,913 --> 00:54:50,333
we are facing certain defeat on land,

871
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:55,049
the annihilation of our army,
and imminent invasion.

872
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:57,629
We must be rational.

873
00:54:57,714 --> 00:55:00,554
We are a seagoing nation.

874
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:03,854
Have been since the Bronze Age.

875
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,430
The Channel is ours.

876
00:55:06,515 --> 00:55:09,395
It's our moat, our battlement,

877
00:55:09,476 --> 00:55:12,096
and the German doesn't
recognize an expanse of water

878
00:55:12,187 --> 00:55:14,107
greater than a bloody lake.

879
00:55:14,231 --> 00:55:17,781
They have first to reach
this island, Edward.

880
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:19,530
Where men, women and children,

881
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:21,611
whom we will have failed despicably

882
00:55:21,697 --> 00:55:23,657
in our duty of protection, will be

883
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,760
- entirely defenseless...
- And whose fault is that?

884
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:28,754
...against the largest army
the world has ever seen.

885
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:30,459
Furthermore, once France falls,

886
00:55:30,539 --> 00:55:33,329
Germany can concentrate
on aircraft production.

887
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:35,787
They will then have
the French fleet as well.

888
00:55:35,878 --> 00:55:38,338
What is to stop
Herr Hitler then, Winston?

889
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:41,802
Words, words, words alone.

890
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,930
If you will not permit any talk of peace,

891
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:47,223
then I shall be forced...

892
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:49,096
Might we not allow Edward

893
00:55:49,183 --> 00:55:52,943
simply to meet the
Italian Ambassador Bastianini,

894
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,270
discuss a possible role

895
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:58,685
as mediators between us and Germany,

896
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:01,358
and find out their price?

897
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:19,302
Sir.

898
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:42,190
- Mr. President.
- Winston.

899
00:56:42,277 --> 00:56:43,947
Franklin.

900
00:56:44,154 --> 00:56:47,374
- How are you?
- Fine. Fine.

901
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:49,119
How are you, Prime Minister?

902
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:51,241
Oh, I'm in fine fettle.

903
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:52,500
Fine fettle.

904
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:54,459
Listen.

905
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:59,628
I'm, telephoning about your navy ships.

906
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:02,171
If you could loan us just,

907
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:05,593
50 older destroyers.

908
00:57:05,676 --> 00:57:08,846
- Ah, yes.
- Or even 40 would do.

909
00:57:09,471 --> 00:57:11,141
Well, I,

910
00:57:11,223 --> 00:57:13,063
I did ask around,

911
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:16,689
but just not possible, I'm afraid.

912
00:57:16,979 --> 00:57:21,649
The Neutrality Act we signed
last year has tied my hands.

913
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:23,323
Just can't swing it.

914
00:57:23,694 --> 00:57:24,784
I tried.

915
00:57:24,862 --> 00:57:26,572
Well, can I...

916
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:32,412
Do I have your permission

917
00:57:32,494 --> 00:57:35,164
to send an aircraft carrier

918
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:37,167
to pick up the P-40 fighter planes

919
00:57:37,249 --> 00:57:38,669
we purchased from you?

920
00:57:42,588 --> 00:57:44,168
Mr. President?

921
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:47,135
Well, you've got me there again.

922
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:49,757
New law preventing transshipment

923
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:51,685
of military equipment.

924
00:57:51,763 --> 00:57:53,933
But we paid for them.

925
00:57:54,224 --> 00:57:56,814
We paid for them with the money that we...

926
00:57:56,894 --> 00:57:58,604
that we borrowed from you.

927
00:57:58,812 --> 00:58:01,942
I'm so, so sorry, Winston.

928
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:09,701
I need not impress upon you the...

929
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:14,615
the trouble faced
by the Western Hemisphere,

930
00:58:15,787 --> 00:58:19,917
without your support in some fashion.

931
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,840
I know. I know.

932
00:58:21,919 --> 00:58:24,709
You are on my mind day and night.

933
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:30,587
Look, we could possibly...

934
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:32,637
Mr. President...

935
00:58:32,721 --> 00:58:34,391
I mean to say...

936
00:58:34,473 --> 00:58:39,893
We are facing the gravest odds.

937
00:58:39,978 --> 00:58:41,398
We could take your planes

938
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,020
to about a mile from the Canadian border.

939
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,740
And then, if you send across

940
00:58:46,818 --> 00:58:51,408
a team of horses from Canada,
nothing motorized

941
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:54,330
then you could pull them
over the border yourself.

942
00:58:56,203 --> 00:58:58,203
How does that sound?

943
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:02,746
Horses?

944
00:59:04,294 --> 00:59:06,714
You did say,

945
00:59:06,797 --> 00:59:09,297
a team of horses?

946
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,760
Well, I guess you could
push them yourself.

947
00:59:13,387 --> 00:59:15,387
Damn things have wheels.

948
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:19,480
Up to you.

949
00:59:23,146 --> 00:59:25,816
We could do that, Prime Minister.

950
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:30,696
Prime Minister?

951
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,580
Anything you could do at this time,

952
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:39,661
Franklin, would be most welcome.

953
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:42,829
Good night to you, Winston.

954
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:45,338
It must be late there.

955
00:59:46,295 --> 00:59:51,225
In more ways than you could possibly know.

956
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:28,342
- Prime Minister.
- Prime Minister.

957
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,470
Get me Admiral Ramsay
on one of these, will you?

958
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:41,806
Yes, Prime Minister.

959
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:44,519
Put me through to Admiral Ramsay.

960
01:01:03,497 --> 01:01:05,077
Admiral Ramsay.

961
01:01:05,165 --> 01:01:06,995
It's the prime minister.

962
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:09,376
Bertie?

963
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,300
Bertie, I hope I didn't wake you.

964
01:01:13,382 --> 01:01:16,132
Not at all. I was just reading the Bible.

965
01:01:16,218 --> 01:01:18,178
Exodus?

966
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:20,676
Listen, Bertie.

967
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:23,479
We need to evacuate our boys.

968
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:26,729
The Navy is saying that with one cruiser

969
01:01:26,812 --> 01:01:28,652
and six destroyers and with the...

970
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:31,730
the Luftwaffe controlling the skies above,

971
01:01:31,817 --> 01:01:33,777
we'll be lucky to get ten percent out.

972
01:01:34,111 --> 01:01:38,781
I want you to order an assembly of boats.

973
01:01:40,492 --> 01:01:41,952
Boats?

974
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:43,325
Yes.

975
01:01:43,412 --> 01:01:45,412
Civilian boats.

976
01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:48,537
As many as you can get your hands on.

977
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:51,625
Longley's Clipper,
Fearnley's Gin Palace,

978
01:01:51,712 --> 01:01:54,132
anyone with a pleasure craft
bigger than 30 foot

979
01:01:54,214 --> 01:01:55,634
that can get to France.

980
01:01:58,135 --> 01:01:59,935
Bertie, you still there?

981
01:02:00,762 --> 01:02:02,182
Um... Right.

982
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:07,309
Help me stage this thing, Bertie?

983
01:02:07,895 --> 01:02:11,945
We must at least try to bring
some of our boys home.

984
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:15,322
Well, I'll have the BBC issue the order.

985
01:02:15,736 --> 01:02:16,946
Good.

986
01:02:17,029 --> 01:02:19,569
Oh, and Bertie, you still there?

987
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:23,029
- Sir.
- We need a name

988
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:25,117
for this operation.

989
01:02:28,248 --> 01:02:30,059
Good morning, Prime Minister.
Prime Minister, do you have

990
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,478
anything you'd like to say
to our readers this morning?

991
01:02:31,502 --> 01:02:33,212
Prime Minister. Mr. Churchill, sir.

992
01:02:33,295 --> 01:02:34,898
Prime Minister, do you have
anything you'd like to say?

993
01:02:34,922 --> 01:02:37,012
Prime Minister?
Prime Minister, are you going to...

994
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:39,130
Prime Minister, would you like to...
Prime Minister?

995
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:49,143
How do you manage drinking during the day?

996
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,610
Practice.

997
01:03:13,043 --> 01:03:14,043
I...

998
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:16,797
should like to discuss...

999
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:20,295
I have been asked if plans should be drawn

1000
01:03:20,384 --> 01:03:24,974
to evacuate myself
and my family to Canada.

1001
01:03:26,098 --> 01:03:28,728
I would like to know
the opinion of our prime minister.

1002
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:32,482
Well, my opinion would be that you must do

1003
01:03:32,563 --> 01:03:34,813
what you feel is right for yourself,

1004
01:03:35,691 --> 01:03:38,691
your family and the nation.

1005
01:03:40,028 --> 01:03:42,448
I mean, your survival is paramount.

1006
01:03:43,699 --> 01:03:45,529
Prime ministers...

1007
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:48,867
well, we seem to come and go
at an astonishing rate.

1008
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:52,328
Your position in Parliament, I...

1009
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:55,423
I'm told, is not strong.

1010
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,420
My party

1011
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:05,224
resents the way
Chamberlain was pushed aside.

1012
01:04:05,304 --> 01:04:06,934
And many others doubt me.

1013
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:08,847
They want Halifax still,

1014
01:04:08,932 --> 01:04:11,062
but why get rid of the organ grinder

1015
01:04:11,143 --> 01:04:12,643
and replace him with the monkey?

1016
01:04:12,728 --> 01:04:15,938
Lord Halifax is
a close personal friend of mine.

1017
01:04:21,695 --> 01:04:23,565
I am unwanted.

1018
01:04:26,158 --> 01:04:29,788
I've never been trusted
since the Gallipoli campaign.

1019
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:32,545
Unwanted.

1020
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:35,418
Perhaps it's because you scare people.

1021
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:37,036
Who?

1022
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:38,207
You scare me.

1023
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:40,708
What nonsense.

1024
01:04:42,841 --> 01:04:46,091
What could possibly be scary about me?

1025
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:49,220
One never knows what's going
to come out of your mouth next.

1026
01:04:49,306 --> 01:04:51,016
Something that will flatter,

1027
01:04:51,099 --> 01:04:52,979
something that will wound.

1028
01:04:58,106 --> 01:05:01,736
My emotions are unbridled.

1029
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:05,990
A wildness in the blood

1030
01:05:06,073 --> 01:05:09,533
I share with my father.

1031
01:05:10,536 --> 01:05:12,696
And my mother also.

1032
01:05:13,539 --> 01:05:16,459
We lacked the gift of temperance.

1033
01:05:18,877 --> 01:05:20,337
Were you close to your parents?

1034
01:05:20,629 --> 01:05:24,219
My mother was glamorous,

1035
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:28,092
but perhaps too widely loved.

1036
01:05:29,555 --> 01:05:32,475
My father was like God,

1037
01:05:33,058 --> 01:05:34,558
busy elsewhere.

1038
01:05:35,853 --> 01:05:36,853
Hmm.

1039
01:06:18,437 --> 01:06:19,997
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Prime Minister.

1040
01:06:20,022 --> 01:06:25,692
I have asked the minister for war
to join us.

1041
01:06:25,944 --> 01:06:28,454
Neville, would you...

1042
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:29,862
Anthony.

1043
01:06:32,034 --> 01:06:36,794
Obviously, we are
in a dangerous situation.

1044
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:39,544
But I am assured by the French premier

1045
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:42,635
that while some German tank units

1046
01:06:42,711 --> 01:06:44,751
have reached the sea,

1047
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:47,880
the situation generally seems
to be well in hand.

1048
01:06:47,966 --> 01:06:50,546
What news from Calais?

1049
01:06:50,636 --> 01:06:52,506
The garrison attacked, but was forced back

1050
01:06:52,596 --> 01:06:54,556
and is now surrounded on all sides.

1051
01:06:55,557 --> 01:06:57,887
They're being shelled
and bombed mercilessly.

1052
01:06:58,310 --> 01:06:59,980
Casualties are at 60%.

1053
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:05,034
Hmm.

1054
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,740
Prime Minister.

1055
01:07:13,492 --> 01:07:14,952
The question of peace talks.

1056
01:07:15,994 --> 01:07:17,834
We must hold our nerve.

1057
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:23,000
Signal only that we intend
to fight it out until the end.

1058
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:25,248
A peace offer

1059
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:27,169
- telegraphs our weakness.
- Agreed.

1060
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:29,666
And even if we were beaten,
we should be no worse off

1061
01:07:29,758 --> 01:07:32,218
than we should be if we were
now to abandon the struggle.

1062
01:07:32,803 --> 01:07:34,513
Let us therefore avoid

1063
01:07:34,596 --> 01:07:37,886
being dragged down the slippery slope

1064
01:07:37,975 --> 01:07:40,105
with talk of a negotiated peace.

1065
01:07:40,185 --> 01:07:42,265
Slippery slope? The only...

1066
01:07:42,354 --> 01:07:45,574
- I suspect Italy and Germany...
- The only slippery slope...

1067
01:07:45,649 --> 01:07:48,229
...wish to get us so deeply
involved in negotiations

1068
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:51,198
- that we should be unable to turn back.
- Nonsense.

1069
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,320
- Bastianini informed me...
- I propose...

1070
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:55,807
- The only slippery slope...
- Would you stop interrupting me

1071
01:07:55,868 --> 01:07:57,828
while I am interrupting you?

1072
01:08:01,874 --> 01:08:04,254
When I chose my War Cabinet,
I took great care

1073
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:06,964
to surround myself with old rivals.

1074
01:08:08,172 --> 01:08:09,592
I may have overdone it.

1075
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:12,045
Viscount Halifax,

1076
01:08:12,384 --> 01:08:16,104
the approach you propose is...
It's not only...

1077
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:17,760
It's futile.

1078
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:20,477
But it involves us in a deadly danger.

1079
01:08:20,559 --> 01:08:22,189
The deadly danger here

1080
01:08:22,269 --> 01:08:26,689
is this romantic fantasy
of fighting to the end.

1081
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:29,902
What is the end,

1082
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,199
if not the destruction of all things?

1083
01:08:34,114 --> 01:08:35,284
There's nothing heroic

1084
01:08:35,365 --> 01:08:37,575
in going down fighting
if it can be avoided.

1085
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:41,119
Nothing even remotely patriotic
in death or glory

1086
01:08:41,205 --> 01:08:43,335
if the odds are firmly on the former.

1087
01:08:43,415 --> 01:08:46,785
Nothing inglorious
in trying to shorten a war

1088
01:08:46,877 --> 01:08:48,287
that we are clearly losing.

1089
01:08:48,378 --> 01:08:50,918
Losing? Europe is still...

1090
01:08:51,006 --> 01:08:52,376
Europe is lost.

1091
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:02,895
And before our forces
are wiped out completely,

1092
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,560
now is the time to negotiate,

1093
01:09:05,646 --> 01:09:08,566
in order to obtain
the best conditions possible.

1094
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:12,737
Hitler will not insist on
outrageous terms.

1095
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:14,109
He will know his own weaknesses.

1096
01:09:14,196 --> 01:09:15,696
He will be reasonable.

1097
01:09:15,781 --> 01:09:17,911
When will the lesson be learned?

1098
01:09:18,283 --> 01:09:20,743
When will the lesson be learned?

1099
01:09:22,162 --> 01:09:24,462
How many more dictators

1100
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:28,000
must be, wooed, appeased,

1101
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:30,055
good God, given immense privileges

1102
01:09:30,128 --> 01:09:32,008
before we learn?

1103
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:35,381
You cannot reason with a tiger

1104
01:09:35,467 --> 01:09:38,007
when your head is in its mouth!

1105
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,010
Prime Minister.

1106
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:44,099
Winston. Winston.

1107
01:09:45,394 --> 01:09:46,663
Yesterday, you gave permission...

1108
01:09:46,687 --> 01:09:48,057
What permission?

1109
01:09:48,146 --> 01:09:49,936
For me to meet Bastianini.

1110
01:09:50,023 --> 01:09:51,703
I sanctioned
the theoretical exploration...

1111
01:09:51,775 --> 01:09:52,775
Theoretical?

1112
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:55,110
...of what price Italy would ask.
Nothing more.

1113
01:09:55,195 --> 01:09:57,215
- I did not sanction any...
- If you will not permit

1114
01:09:57,239 --> 01:09:59,159
further exploration of a peace agreement,

1115
01:09:59,241 --> 01:10:00,701
then you will have my resignation.

1116
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:02,414
Don't be absurd, Edward.

1117
01:10:02,494 --> 01:10:05,834
- I need you. You know I do.
- I will not stand by

1118
01:10:05,914 --> 01:10:09,174
to watch another generation
of young men die

1119
01:10:09,251 --> 01:10:10,881
at the bloody altar of your hubris.

1120
01:10:10,961 --> 01:10:13,591
Oh, and you would have us die as lambs!

1121
01:10:13,672 --> 01:10:15,222
Was Gallipoli not enough for you?

1122
01:10:15,299 --> 01:10:16,799
How dare you!

1123
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:21,007
Our troops were chewing
barbed wire in Flanders,

1124
01:10:21,096 --> 01:10:22,506
and I saw it!

1125
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:26,728
Opening a second front,
outflanking the Turks

1126
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:29,190
was a serious military idea,

1127
01:10:29,271 --> 01:10:31,231
and it could have
damn well worked if the...

1128
01:10:31,315 --> 01:10:33,275
if the admirals and the First Sea Lord

1129
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:36,438
hadn't dithered away
our element of surprise.

1130
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:42,368
Choice is yours, Winston.

1131
01:10:42,826 --> 01:10:45,036
You have 24 hours
to enter into peace talks,

1132
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,410
or I shall resign.

1133
01:11:01,094 --> 01:11:02,434
I told him.

1134
01:11:02,888 --> 01:11:04,348
It shook him.

1135
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:06,520
I imagine it did.

1136
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,480
Gave him 24 hours.

1137
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,650
I don't expect he'll agree,
so I shall resign first.

1138
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:13,690
You then follow, that's critical if we're

1139
01:11:13,774 --> 01:11:15,864
to trigger a vote
of no confidence in the House.

1140
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,740
I shall announce it.

1141
01:11:19,696 --> 01:11:21,196
The king will back us.

1142
01:11:37,589 --> 01:11:38,879
Prime Minister.

1143
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:40,336
I wonder if we might schedule you

1144
01:11:40,425 --> 01:11:41,585
to address the Outer Cabinet.

1145
01:11:43,762 --> 01:11:45,365
Today, the Admiralty

1146
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:47,519
have made an order requesting all owners

1147
01:11:47,599 --> 01:11:49,019
of self-propelled pleasure craft

1148
01:11:49,101 --> 01:11:51,691
between 30 and 100 feet in length

1149
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:55,020
to send all particulars
to the Admiralty immediately...

1150
01:11:55,107 --> 01:11:57,107
To Brigadier Nicholson.

1151
01:12:00,237 --> 01:12:04,367
30 Infantry Brigade, Calais.

1152
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:08,831
Every hour

1153
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:12,172
you continue to exist

1154
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:15,415
is of the greatest help

1155
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:19,010
to our forces at Dunkirk.

1156
01:12:22,009 --> 01:12:26,719
Have the greatest possible admiration

1157
01:12:27,681 --> 01:12:29,681
for your splendid stand.

1158
01:12:35,022 --> 01:12:37,112
Your evacuation, however,

1159
01:12:37,858 --> 01:12:40,398
will not take place.

1160
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:47,738
I repeat,

1161
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:51,790
will not take place.

1162
01:13:00,255 --> 01:13:01,375
Sign.

1163
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:18,728
Here. Here.

1164
01:13:22,277 --> 01:13:23,647
May I be excused?

1165
01:13:24,029 --> 01:13:25,199
You may not.

1166
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:28,947
What is this about?

1167
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:33,197
No one tells us anything.

1168
01:13:35,082 --> 01:13:36,922
It's all classified.

1169
01:13:38,669 --> 01:13:41,669
We hear scraps,
and it's worse than knowing nothing.

1170
01:13:46,468 --> 01:13:48,218
What would you like to know?

1171
01:13:56,019 --> 01:13:58,479
How many men will survive?

1172
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:06,735
Come with me.

1173
01:14:15,205 --> 01:14:16,785
I'm not allowed in the Map Room.

1174
01:14:16,874 --> 01:14:18,424
- Well, you are now.
- Prime Minister.

1175
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,090
At ease, gentlemen.

1176
01:14:22,796 --> 01:14:24,006
Now...

1177
01:14:27,301 --> 01:14:29,841
The German army controls every French port

1178
01:14:29,928 --> 01:14:32,388
except Dunkirk here
and Calais here to the west,

1179
01:14:32,472 --> 01:14:35,062
where the garrison
under Brigadier Nicholson

1180
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:39,272
is drawing fire and delaying
the German advance on Dunkirk.

1181
01:14:39,354 --> 01:14:42,944
At both points, our troops are encircled.

1182
01:14:43,025 --> 01:14:45,035
Now, we are still trying

1183
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:47,610
to clear Dunkirk Harbor of wrecked ships

1184
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:50,486
so that we can then land
the boats we need to get

1185
01:14:50,574 --> 01:14:52,034
our boys off those beaches.

1186
01:14:52,117 --> 01:14:54,987
But enemy aircraft
is attacking us constantly.

1187
01:14:55,078 --> 01:14:59,668
Our only hope in Dunkirk
is thick cloud cover

1188
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:02,997
to thwart these attacks,
but the skies remain clear.

1189
01:15:03,587 --> 01:15:07,837
And even then, I am told
we will need a...

1190
01:15:07,925 --> 01:15:11,395
a miracle to get even
ten percent of our men out.

1191
01:15:14,515 --> 01:15:16,895
Courage, Miss Layton.

1192
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:19,308
Courage.

1193
01:15:19,937 --> 01:15:21,187
General.

1194
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:23,937
How long have they got

1195
01:15:25,275 --> 01:15:26,815
if we don't rescue them?

1196
01:15:29,947 --> 01:15:32,657
One, maybe

1197
01:15:33,784 --> 01:15:35,294
two days.

1198
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:43,496
News from Calais, the 30th Infantry, sir.

1199
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:45,455
They've retreated to the town's citadel

1200
01:15:45,546 --> 01:15:48,166
as a last and probably hopeless stand.

1201
01:15:48,257 --> 01:15:50,927
The order, "every man
for himself," has been given.

1202
01:15:51,009 --> 01:15:52,445
- Thank you, thank you.
- Brigadier Nicholson.

1203
01:15:52,469 --> 01:15:54,389
- There's a telegram, sir.
- Thank you.

1204
01:15:59,685 --> 01:16:00,855
Good show, chaps.

1205
01:16:00,936 --> 01:16:03,396
Well done, lads. Well done.

1206
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,980
All right.

1207
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:10,400
He's losing too much blood.

1208
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:12,697
We need another transfusion here.

1209
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,040
All right, men? All right?

1210
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:35,641
Your evacuation, however,

1211
01:16:36,054 --> 01:16:38,604
will not take place.

1212
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:43,767
I repeat, will not take place.

1213
01:17:30,817 --> 01:17:32,397
Go to bed, Pig.

1214
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:35,948
You must sleep.

1215
01:17:38,492 --> 01:17:40,452
Leave me, Clemmie.

1216
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:43,999
The opportunity for doing so
passed a long time ago.

1217
01:18:15,571 --> 01:18:17,491
Operator.
How may I direct your call?

1218
01:18:17,573 --> 01:18:20,623
- Give me Ramsay.
- One moment, please.

1219
01:18:21,994 --> 01:18:23,874
- Bertie?
- Sir?

1220
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:25,409
What's been the response?

1221
01:18:25,497 --> 01:18:26,917
It will take time.

1222
01:18:26,999 --> 01:18:28,289
It's too soon to judge.

1223
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:29,825
How many boats so far?

1224
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:31,878
Winston, it will take time.

1225
01:18:31,962 --> 01:18:35,512
The request for civilian boats,
Bertie, was not a request.

1226
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:37,631
It was an order!

1227
01:18:52,566 --> 01:18:54,606
- Miss Layton.
- Sir.

1228
01:18:54,693 --> 01:18:57,493
I need to reach,

1229
01:18:57,946 --> 01:18:59,106
to reach,

1230
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:01,702
to speak to...

1231
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:04,200
To?

1232
01:19:04,912 --> 01:19:06,042
3:00 p.m.

1233
01:19:06,121 --> 01:19:07,371
2:00 p.m., sir?

1234
01:19:08,415 --> 01:19:10,035
Yes. Yes.

1235
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:12,995
Ask Bridges to summon the...

1236
01:19:14,087 --> 01:19:15,167
Oh, God.

1237
01:19:15,255 --> 01:19:17,585
The War Cabinet, at 3:00 p.m.

1238
01:19:17,674 --> 01:19:18,804
Thank you!

1239
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:24,141
Sir.

1240
01:19:24,723 --> 01:19:27,433
From Lord Gort in France, sir.

1241
01:19:32,356 --> 01:19:34,566
Belgium has fallen.

1242
01:19:36,527 --> 01:19:39,697
They will surrender at midnight.

1243
01:19:42,616 --> 01:19:44,616
France will soon follow suit.

1244
01:19:57,631 --> 01:19:58,971
We have received reports

1245
01:19:59,049 --> 01:20:00,759
that the most probable method of attack

1246
01:20:00,843 --> 01:20:03,053
which Germany might employ
against this country

1247
01:20:03,178 --> 01:20:05,928
is a large fleet of fast motorboats,

1248
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:08,774
possibly up to 200,
carrying a hundred men apiece,

1249
01:20:08,851 --> 01:20:11,601
to carry out a seaborne raid
on a large scale.

1250
01:20:11,687 --> 01:20:14,267
By these means,
a considerable force of the enemy

1251
01:20:14,356 --> 01:20:16,396
could be landed
at many points on the coast

1252
01:20:16,483 --> 01:20:19,613
simultaneously with airborne raids inland.

1253
01:20:19,695 --> 01:20:23,455
We do not feel
that by naval or air action,

1254
01:20:23,532 --> 01:20:25,532
we could prevent such a landing.

1255
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,540
Could you repeat that?

1256
01:20:29,955 --> 01:20:31,295
We must prepare

1257
01:20:31,373 --> 01:20:33,503
for the imminent invasion of our island.

1258
01:20:37,588 --> 01:20:40,088
We must prepare for
the imminent invasion of our island.

1259
01:20:40,841 --> 01:20:42,551
We recommend that the country

1260
01:20:42,634 --> 01:20:45,604
should be warned and roused
to the immediate danger,

1261
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:47,139
and that all personnel

1262
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:49,892
required to put Britain
in a state of defense

1263
01:20:49,975 --> 01:20:53,275
should be mobilized
without a moment's delay.

1264
01:20:53,353 --> 01:20:54,523
Lights.

1265
01:21:00,611 --> 01:21:03,321
Thank you, General.

1266
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:10,200
Let all preparations be made.

1267
01:21:11,705 --> 01:21:13,615
Let the record state, I have received word

1268
01:21:13,707 --> 01:21:15,377
from the Italian embassy in London.

1269
01:21:15,459 --> 01:21:17,629
Italy is prepared to mediate a resolution

1270
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:19,841
between Britain, its allies and Germany.

1271
01:21:25,928 --> 01:21:28,468
Perhaps then,

1272
01:21:30,307 --> 01:21:35,057
the time for such an offer from us

1273
01:21:35,145 --> 01:21:36,765
is when...

1274
01:21:41,318 --> 01:21:43,358
Well, is when...

1275
01:21:45,739 --> 01:21:51,119
Is when Germany has made
an unsuccessful attempt

1276
01:21:51,203 --> 01:21:53,793
- to invade this country.
- Unsuccessful?

1277
01:21:53,872 --> 01:21:55,792
Then you leave me
no other option but to offer...

1278
01:21:55,874 --> 01:21:57,634
Winston. Winston!

1279
01:21:58,293 --> 01:22:02,463
You are refusing to grasp the realities

1280
01:22:02,548 --> 01:22:05,968
of how precarious our position is.

1281
01:22:06,677 --> 01:22:10,507
Our entire army is about to be wiped out.

1282
01:22:10,889 --> 01:22:13,729
Terms must be struck.

1283
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:20,070
Anthony.

1284
01:22:38,458 --> 01:22:41,038
Then it seems we...

1285
01:22:43,005 --> 01:22:45,055
We have no choice

1286
01:22:46,008 --> 01:22:48,638
but to at least consider the

1287
01:22:49,386 --> 01:22:52,506
path of negotiation.

1288
01:22:54,516 --> 01:22:57,556
If Hitler's peace terms are

1289
01:22:59,688 --> 01:23:03,438
over lordship of Central Europe,

1290
01:23:04,276 --> 01:23:08,276
return of certain German colonies,

1291
01:23:09,323 --> 01:23:13,373
and if he will leave us

1292
01:23:14,578 --> 01:23:16,868
our independence,

1293
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:22,336
then I'd be grateful

1294
01:23:23,337 --> 01:23:26,007
to get out of our present...

1295
01:23:27,508 --> 01:23:28,878
difficulties.

1296
01:23:30,511 --> 01:23:32,301
But it is unlikely

1297
01:23:33,263 --> 01:23:36,103
that he will make such an offer.

1298
01:23:36,183 --> 01:23:41,353
But if I were told
what the German terms were,

1299
01:23:46,068 --> 01:23:50,238
well, then I'd be prepared
to consider them.

1300
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:54,200
Thank you, Prime Minister.

1301
01:23:55,035 --> 01:23:57,575
We shall prepare
a draft memorandum at once.

1302
01:24:10,133 --> 01:24:14,053
I have come to wonder,

1303
01:24:14,137 --> 01:24:16,967
in recent days...

1304
01:24:21,728 --> 01:24:24,188
whether it was...

1305
01:24:27,025 --> 01:24:28,895
part of my duty...

1306
01:24:32,406 --> 01:24:35,156
part of my...

1307
01:24:36,034 --> 01:24:38,504
part of my duty to...

1308
01:24:40,163 --> 01:24:42,293
to consider...

1309
01:24:44,251 --> 01:24:45,841
to consider,

1310
01:24:52,217 --> 01:24:54,387
to consider...

1311
01:24:56,972 --> 01:24:59,472
...whether it was...

1312
01:24:59,558 --> 01:25:01,848
Will that be all for tonight, sir?

1313
01:25:06,231 --> 01:25:09,281
...whether it was part of my duty

1314
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:13,449
entering into...

1315
01:25:14,364 --> 01:25:17,534
into negotiations with,

1316
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:23,711
...that...

1317
01:25:25,959 --> 01:25:27,839
...that corporal...

1318
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,680
that child.

1319
01:25:40,098 --> 01:25:43,018
And monster of wickedness.

1320
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:45,940
That butcher.

1321
01:25:46,146 --> 01:25:49,516
That savage.

1322
01:25:49,858 --> 01:25:52,148
Monstrous savage.

1323
01:25:58,909 --> 01:26:00,739
That wicked

1324
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:04,080
house painter.

1325
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:09,212
House painter!

1326
01:26:16,176 --> 01:26:19,296
Where were we?

1327
01:26:22,766 --> 01:26:23,976
Well?

1328
01:26:26,854 --> 01:26:28,774
I didn't understand you, sir.

1329
01:26:30,315 --> 01:26:31,725
You were...

1330
01:26:32,109 --> 01:26:33,359
Were?

1331
01:26:34,444 --> 01:26:35,744
You were mumbling.

1332
01:26:35,821 --> 01:26:37,571
"Mumbling."

1333
01:26:42,828 --> 01:26:45,748
The right words

1334
01:26:47,291 --> 01:26:48,751
won't come.

1335
01:26:49,376 --> 01:26:50,616
They will come, sir.

1336
01:26:51,253 --> 01:26:53,843
No one can put words together like you.

1337
01:27:04,725 --> 01:27:05,735
Oh!

1338
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:18,320
Your beau?

1339
01:27:19,698 --> 01:27:21,028
My brother.

1340
01:27:23,744 --> 01:27:25,204
Where is he now?

1341
01:27:25,871 --> 01:27:27,831
He was falling back on Dunkirk.

1342
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:31,128
But he never made it.

1343
01:27:55,776 --> 01:27:56,936
What?

1344
01:28:02,533 --> 01:28:04,453
Just looking at you.

1345
01:28:31,395 --> 01:28:33,155
Shall I read back what we have?

1346
01:28:35,691 --> 01:28:37,861
Yes, please.

1347
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:46,790
"I have come to wonder in recent days

1348
01:28:47,703 --> 01:28:50,083
"whether it was my duty to consider

1349
01:28:50,163 --> 01:28:54,633
"entering into negotiations with..."

1350
01:28:58,338 --> 01:28:59,758
With?

1351
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:49,970
I've just been standing,

1352
01:29:50,265 --> 01:29:54,225
imagining never being here anymore,

1353
01:29:55,312 --> 01:29:57,732
whether it is because I'm no longer alive

1354
01:29:57,814 --> 01:30:00,154
or that the palace itself is gone.

1355
01:30:00,234 --> 01:30:02,034
Canada.

1356
01:30:03,237 --> 01:30:04,647
You must decide, sir.

1357
01:30:05,322 --> 01:30:06,492
You could rule in exile.

1358
01:30:06,573 --> 01:30:09,083
Truly? Is that to be my fate?

1359
01:30:14,122 --> 01:30:15,502
You know something?

1360
01:30:15,582 --> 01:30:18,962
I'm aware in this moment of feeling angry.

1361
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:23,260
Bloody angry.

1362
01:30:26,927 --> 01:30:28,637
Darling.

1363
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:33,390
Winston, darling.

1364
01:30:36,186 --> 01:30:37,766
There's someone to see you.

1365
01:30:38,438 --> 01:30:39,768
You have a visitor.

1366
01:30:51,118 --> 01:30:53,408
My darling, you have the full weight

1367
01:30:53,495 --> 01:30:55,115
of the world on your shoulders.

1368
01:30:55,789 --> 01:30:57,619
No, I know, I know.

1369
01:30:57,708 --> 01:31:00,168
But these inner battles

1370
01:31:01,712 --> 01:31:04,212
have actually trained you

1371
01:31:04,756 --> 01:31:06,166
for this very moment.

1372
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:09,720
You are strong because you are imperfect.

1373
01:31:09,803 --> 01:31:13,853
You are wise because you have doubts.

1374
01:31:16,101 --> 01:31:18,521
Now, shall I let him in?

1375
01:31:20,272 --> 01:31:21,482
Who?

1376
01:31:22,524 --> 01:31:23,694
The king.

1377
01:31:23,775 --> 01:31:25,815
Which king?

1378
01:31:26,528 --> 01:31:28,358
Our king?

1379
01:31:28,447 --> 01:31:31,657
Well, if it isn't him,
it's a marvelous impersonation.

1380
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:42,836
Mr. Churchill.

1381
01:31:43,128 --> 01:31:46,628
I hope you can forgive the late hour, but

1382
01:31:46,715 --> 01:31:50,175
your wife thought tonight
would be a good time.

1383
01:31:51,637 --> 01:31:52,847
Shall we sit?

1384
01:31:53,263 --> 01:31:54,643
Oh, yes.

1385
01:31:54,723 --> 01:31:56,523
Please.

1386
01:32:00,729 --> 01:32:02,399
Something to drink, perhaps?

1387
01:32:02,481 --> 01:32:03,611
No.

1388
01:32:10,781 --> 01:32:16,161
I received a visit.

1389
01:32:17,204 --> 01:32:18,464
From?

1390
01:32:18,539 --> 01:32:20,039
Viscount Halifax.

1391
01:32:20,123 --> 01:32:23,003
It appears that
the prospect of a peace deal

1392
01:32:24,378 --> 01:32:27,838
has increased dramatically.

1393
01:32:29,508 --> 01:32:33,928
The War Cabinet is drafting
a letter to Mussolini,

1394
01:32:34,638 --> 01:32:39,808
asking him to broker talks
with Herr Hitler.

1395
01:32:43,063 --> 01:32:46,153
Then Halifax was correct.

1396
01:32:48,402 --> 01:32:50,702
I should like to know your mind.

1397
01:32:50,779 --> 01:32:53,779
It would be helpful to know yours first.

1398
01:32:54,116 --> 01:32:57,536
I should like to know it myself.

1399
01:32:59,371 --> 01:33:01,501
Nations

1400
01:33:01,957 --> 01:33:05,127
which go down fighting rise again,
and those

1401
01:33:06,086 --> 01:33:08,376
that surrender tamely are finished.

1402
01:33:08,463 --> 01:33:09,713
Belgium?

1403
01:33:10,674 --> 01:33:12,094
- Collapsed.
- Norway?

1404
01:33:12,176 --> 01:33:13,506
Holland.

1405
01:33:14,094 --> 01:33:15,724
France any hour.

1406
01:33:15,804 --> 01:33:17,224
And the mood of Parliament?

1407
01:33:17,306 --> 01:33:18,386
Fear. Panic.

1408
01:33:18,473 --> 01:33:20,023
And you?

1409
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:23,480
Are you not afraid?

1410
01:33:24,855 --> 01:33:27,905
I am, most terribly.

1411
01:33:29,568 --> 01:33:34,318
Support in the War Cabinet

1412
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:37,700
for the campaign of resistance

1413
01:33:39,077 --> 01:33:40,287
has collapsed.

1414
01:33:48,462 --> 01:33:53,972
Later today,
I will address the House accordingly.

1415
01:34:04,770 --> 01:34:06,600
You have my support.

1416
01:34:13,904 --> 01:34:15,494
Your Majesty?

1417
01:34:16,532 --> 01:34:18,662
You have my support.

1418
01:34:21,078 --> 01:34:22,618
I confess, I

1419
01:34:23,497 --> 01:34:27,417
had some reservations about you
at first, but

1420
01:34:27,501 --> 01:34:31,051
while some in this country
dreaded your appointment,

1421
01:34:31,129 --> 01:34:35,259
none, none dreaded it like Adolf Hitler.

1422
01:34:35,342 --> 01:34:39,142
Whomever can strike fear
into that brute heart

1423
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:42,220
is worthy of all of our trust.

1424
01:34:42,724 --> 01:34:44,024
We shall work together.

1425
01:34:44,101 --> 01:34:46,981
You shall have my support at any hour.

1426
01:34:47,646 --> 01:34:49,266
Beat the buggers.

1427
01:34:50,691 --> 01:34:52,361
I will go to Parliament.

1428
01:34:53,277 --> 01:34:56,447
But without support in my own party,

1429
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:58,910
I must sue for peace.

1430
01:35:02,953 --> 01:35:04,413
You once gave me some advice.

1431
01:35:04,496 --> 01:35:06,916
Perhaps I can... I can give you some.

1432
01:35:08,167 --> 01:35:09,877
Go to the people.

1433
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,340
Let them instruct you.

1434
01:35:12,421 --> 01:35:15,471
Quite silently, they usually do.

1435
01:35:15,883 --> 01:35:17,263
But tell them

1436
01:35:18,302 --> 01:35:20,972
the truth unvarnished.

1437
01:35:21,054 --> 01:35:23,474
If invasion is imminent,

1438
01:35:23,557 --> 01:35:25,677
if our troops in France are lost,

1439
01:35:26,101 --> 01:35:27,691
they must be prepared.

1440
01:35:31,148 --> 01:35:32,938
On certain matters,

1441
01:35:34,902 --> 01:35:39,282
I have very few people with whom I can

1442
01:35:39,698 --> 01:35:42,408
talk frankly.

1443
01:35:42,492 --> 01:35:44,242
Perhaps now we have each other.

1444
01:35:46,371 --> 01:35:48,791
And I no longer scare you?

1445
01:35:48,874 --> 01:35:50,544
A little.

1446
01:35:50,959 --> 01:35:52,459
But I can cope.

1447
01:36:02,846 --> 01:36:04,676
We are ready. More or less.

1448
01:36:04,765 --> 01:36:07,185
More or less what, Bertie?

1449
01:36:07,267 --> 01:36:08,807
Give me a number.

1450
01:36:08,894 --> 01:36:11,564
In total, 860 vessels.

1451
01:36:11,647 --> 01:36:14,397
The biggest civilian fleet ever assembled.

1452
01:36:14,483 --> 01:36:17,033
Operation Dynamo waits on your command.

1453
01:36:17,110 --> 01:36:18,780
Admiral,

1454
01:36:19,363 --> 01:36:22,243
initiate Dynamo.

1455
01:36:22,324 --> 01:36:25,044
And may God watch over them all.

1456
01:37:50,162 --> 01:37:51,872
We've lost the prime minister.

1457
01:38:14,186 --> 01:38:16,266
Do you know how to use this thing?

1458
01:38:16,355 --> 01:38:17,445
Yes, sir.

1459
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:20,780
How do I get to Westminster?

1460
01:38:20,859 --> 01:38:22,529
Westminster.

1461
01:38:23,779 --> 01:38:26,199
The District Line, east. One stop.

1462
01:38:26,281 --> 01:38:28,991
District Line. East. One stop.

1463
01:38:29,076 --> 01:38:31,486
Well, that doesn't sound so hard.

1464
01:38:31,578 --> 01:38:32,658
No, sir.

1465
01:38:32,746 --> 01:38:34,206
Thank you.

1466
01:38:34,289 --> 01:38:35,789
Thank you, sir.

1467
01:38:35,874 --> 01:38:40,304
The memorandum is titled
"Suggested Approaches to Italy"

1468
01:38:40,379 --> 01:38:41,759
and is as follows.

1469
01:38:41,839 --> 01:38:45,259
"If Signor Mussolini
will cooperate with us

1470
01:38:45,342 --> 01:38:49,182
"in securing a settlement
of all European questions

1471
01:38:49,263 --> 01:38:51,063
"which safeguard
the independence

1472
01:38:51,139 --> 01:38:55,349
"and security of the allies,
and could be the basis

1473
01:38:55,435 --> 01:38:58,305
"of a just and durable peace for Europe,

1474
01:38:58,397 --> 01:39:01,517
"we will undertake at once to discuss,

1475
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:04,150
"with the desire to find solutions,

1476
01:39:04,236 --> 01:39:06,736
"the matters in which Signor Mussolini

1477
01:39:06,822 --> 01:39:08,912
"is primarily interested.

1478
01:39:08,991 --> 01:39:12,331
"We understand that
he desires the solution

1479
01:39:12,411 --> 01:39:14,831
"of certain Mediterranean questions,

1480
01:39:14,913 --> 01:39:18,793
"and if he will state
in secrecy what these are,

1481
01:39:18,876 --> 01:39:21,836
"France and Great Britain will at once

1482
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:24,210
"do their best to meet his wishes."

1483
01:39:29,636 --> 01:39:33,596
So, this is the Underground.

1484
01:39:46,361 --> 01:39:47,611
Thank you.

1485
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:28,030
Does anyone have a match?

1486
01:40:33,659 --> 01:40:35,039
Thank you.

1487
01:40:36,495 --> 01:40:38,125
Thank you.

1488
01:40:40,666 --> 01:40:42,826
What are you all staring at?

1489
01:40:42,918 --> 01:40:45,378
Have you never seen the prime minister

1490
01:40:45,462 --> 01:40:47,302
ride the Underground before?

1491
01:40:50,342 --> 01:40:51,762
What is your name?

1492
01:40:51,844 --> 01:40:53,764
Oliver Wilson, sir.

1493
01:40:55,138 --> 01:40:56,848
And what do you do, Mr. Wilson?

1494
01:40:56,932 --> 01:41:00,142
- Bricklayer, sir.
- Ah, bricklayer.

1495
01:41:00,227 --> 01:41:03,557
We shall have great need
of bricklayers soon.

1496
01:41:03,647 --> 01:41:05,187
Business will be looking up.

1497
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:11,490
Progress.

1498
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:18,289
How old?

1499
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:19,540
Five months, sir.

1500
01:41:19,621 --> 01:41:21,751
He looks like you.

1501
01:41:22,374 --> 01:41:24,924
Madam, all babies look like me.

1502
01:41:27,629 --> 01:41:28,959
Well, what is your name?

1503
01:41:29,047 --> 01:41:30,717
Mrs. Jessie Sutton.

1504
01:41:30,799 --> 01:41:32,629
Ah, Mrs. Sutton.

1505
01:41:32,718 --> 01:41:34,138
It's a pleasure.

1506
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,300
Abigail.

1507
01:41:36,638 --> 01:41:37,848
Abigail Walker.

1508
01:41:37,931 --> 01:41:40,931
- Marcus Peters.
- Marcus Peters.

1509
01:41:43,687 --> 01:41:45,857
- Agnes Dillon.
- Agnes.

1510
01:41:45,939 --> 01:41:48,529
- Maurice Baker.
- Mr. Baker.

1511
01:41:48,609 --> 01:41:50,899
- Alice Simpson.
- Alice Simpson.

1512
01:41:50,986 --> 01:41:52,776
Miss Margaret Jerome.

1513
01:41:53,155 --> 01:41:54,785
Oh, a Jerome.

1514
01:41:54,865 --> 01:41:56,835
My mother was a Jerome.

1515
01:41:56,909 --> 01:42:00,079
I expect we are closely related.

1516
01:42:01,121 --> 01:42:02,911
Please, please. Sit.

1517
01:42:02,998 --> 01:42:04,208
Sit, everyone.

1518
01:42:07,836 --> 01:42:09,916
Thank you, Mr. Baker.

1519
01:42:10,005 --> 01:42:14,755
So, how are you all,
how are you all bearing up?

1520
01:42:15,844 --> 01:42:17,724
Good spirits?

1521
01:42:17,804 --> 01:42:19,184
- Yes.
- Yes?

1522
01:42:19,264 --> 01:42:20,934
Just as well.

1523
01:42:21,016 --> 01:42:22,846
We shall need them.

1524
01:42:24,978 --> 01:42:26,768
Let me ask you something

1525
01:42:27,231 --> 01:42:30,821
that's been weighing on my mind.

1526
01:42:30,901 --> 01:42:33,821
Perhaps you can provide me with an answer.

1527
01:42:34,363 --> 01:42:38,453
You, the British people.

1528
01:42:39,409 --> 01:42:41,329
What is your mood?

1529
01:42:41,912 --> 01:42:44,872
Is it confident?

1530
01:42:44,957 --> 01:42:47,167
- Yeah.
- If confident, how confident?

1531
01:42:47,251 --> 01:42:50,171
- Very.
- Some people say it's a lost cause.

1532
01:42:50,254 --> 01:42:51,924
No, lost causes are the only ones

1533
01:42:52,005 --> 01:42:54,005
- worth fighting for.
- Too right.

1534
01:42:54,091 --> 01:42:56,011
Yes. Now let me ask you this.

1535
01:42:56,093 --> 01:42:58,053
If the worst came to pass

1536
01:42:58,136 --> 01:43:02,176
and the enemy were to appear on those...

1537
01:43:02,266 --> 01:43:05,266
those streets above, what would you do?

1538
01:43:05,352 --> 01:43:07,192
- Fight.
- Fight the fascists.

1539
01:43:07,271 --> 01:43:08,915
Fight them with anything
we can lay our hands on.

1540
01:43:08,939 --> 01:43:11,439
- Broom handles if we must.
- Street by street.

1541
01:43:11,525 --> 01:43:13,235
They will never take Piccadilly.

1542
01:43:13,986 --> 01:43:16,526
Never take Piccadilly, indeed.

1543
01:43:16,613 --> 01:43:19,703
And what if I put it to you all

1544
01:43:19,783 --> 01:43:25,503
that we might, if we, if we ask nicely

1545
01:43:25,581 --> 01:43:29,671
get very favorable terms from Mr. Hitler

1546
01:43:29,751 --> 01:43:33,671
if we enter into a peace deal
with him right now?

1547
01:43:34,131 --> 01:43:35,721
What would you say to that?

1548
01:43:35,799 --> 01:43:38,339
Never! Never! Never!

1549
01:43:38,427 --> 01:43:40,097
Never! Never!

1550
01:43:48,312 --> 01:43:49,562
Never.

1551
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:52,980
Never.

1552
01:43:54,234 --> 01:43:56,034
Will you never give up?

1553
01:43:56,111 --> 01:43:57,651
No. Never.

1554
01:43:59,281 --> 01:44:03,951
"Then out spake brave Horatius,

1555
01:44:06,246 --> 01:44:08,826
"Captain of the Gate:

1556
01:44:10,042 --> 01:44:13,172
"To every man upon this earth

1557
01:44:13,253 --> 01:44:17,923
"Death cometh soon or late.

1558
01:44:18,717 --> 01:44:23,347
"And how can man die better

1559
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:25,850
"Than facing fearful odds

1560
01:44:28,352 --> 01:44:30,982
- "For the ashes..."
- "For the ashes of his fathers

1561
01:44:31,438 --> 01:44:34,188
"And the temples of his Gods."

1562
01:44:44,117 --> 01:44:45,537
Are you crying?

1563
01:44:45,994 --> 01:44:47,294
I...

1564
01:44:47,621 --> 01:44:50,371
Yes, yes. I...

1565
01:44:50,707 --> 01:44:52,827
I blub a lot, you know.

1566
01:44:54,461 --> 01:44:56,801
You'll have to get used to it.

1567
01:44:59,174 --> 01:45:01,134
What stop is this?

1568
01:45:01,552 --> 01:45:03,642
It's Westminster, sir.

1569
01:45:04,054 --> 01:45:07,434
Westminster. It's my stop.

1570
01:45:39,298 --> 01:45:40,668
Prime Minister.

1571
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:44,590
Sir.

1572
01:45:46,388 --> 01:45:48,058
The War Cabinet.

1573
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:49,560
Sir, they're waiting.

1574
01:45:49,641 --> 01:45:52,231
I'm due to address the Outer Cabinet.

1575
01:45:53,103 --> 01:45:54,523
- When?
- Now.

1576
01:45:54,605 --> 01:45:56,405
I haven't spoken to them

1577
01:45:56,481 --> 01:45:58,401
since the formation of the new government.

1578
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:03,700
- Prime Minister.
- Good day, gentlemen.

1579
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:05,870
Prime Minister...

1580
01:46:05,949 --> 01:46:10,249
I-I'm about to, speak to
my Outer Cabinet in my rooms,

1581
01:46:10,329 --> 01:46:13,539
and I extend the invitation to any of you

1582
01:46:13,624 --> 01:46:15,084
who would care to join them.

1583
01:46:17,169 --> 01:46:19,669
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1584
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:39,440
This afternoon,

1585
01:46:41,944 --> 01:46:44,034
I shall address the House

1586
01:46:45,364 --> 01:46:48,494
on the matter of our nation's security.

1587
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:53,330
At this very moment, the War Cabinet

1588
01:46:53,413 --> 01:46:57,423
is drafting papers
that lay out a willingness

1589
01:46:57,501 --> 01:47:00,921
to enter into peace talks
with Herr Hitler,

1590
01:47:01,630 --> 01:47:03,300
via his

1591
01:47:04,132 --> 01:47:06,592
his lackey, Mussolini.

1592
01:47:08,637 --> 01:47:13,557
I have thought
very carefully in these last days

1593
01:47:13,642 --> 01:47:16,272
whether it was part of my duty

1594
01:47:16,979 --> 01:47:21,189
to consider entering
into negotiations with...

1595
01:47:25,362 --> 01:47:27,032
With that man.

1596
01:47:29,366 --> 01:47:31,446
But then I...

1597
01:47:33,704 --> 01:47:37,044
I spoke with

1598
01:47:40,460 --> 01:47:42,130
Oliver Wilson,

1599
01:47:43,130 --> 01:47:45,720
Mrs. Jessie Sutton,

1600
01:47:46,425 --> 01:47:49,895
Mrs. Abigail Walker,

1601
01:47:50,262 --> 01:47:52,512
Marcus Peters,

1602
01:47:52,598 --> 01:47:54,768
Maurice Baker,

1603
01:47:54,850 --> 01:47:56,350
Alice Simpson

1604
01:47:56,435 --> 01:47:59,195
and Miss Margaret Jerome.

1605
01:47:59,563 --> 01:48:01,823
Brave, good, true citizens
of this kingdom.

1606
01:48:01,899 --> 01:48:05,989
And they argued strongly
that it was idle to think,

1607
01:48:06,069 --> 01:48:08,949
if we tried to make peace now,

1608
01:48:09,031 --> 01:48:12,741
we should get better terms
than if we fought it out.

1609
01:48:13,785 --> 01:48:18,495
The Germans, Mr. Baker felt,

1610
01:48:18,832 --> 01:48:22,292
would demand,
in the name of disarmament,

1611
01:48:22,377 --> 01:48:24,457
our naval bases and much else,

1612
01:48:24,546 --> 01:48:26,336
and I think he's right.

1613
01:48:26,423 --> 01:48:30,433
Jessie Sutton, speaking for many,

1614
01:48:30,511 --> 01:48:34,011
believes we would then become a...

1615
01:48:34,097 --> 01:48:36,057
a slave state.

1616
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:40,480
A British government
which would be Hitler's puppet.

1617
01:48:40,562 --> 01:48:44,822
A government set up under Mosley

1618
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:47,030
- or some such person.
- No, no.

1619
01:48:47,110 --> 01:48:50,820
And I join with them in asking
a further question.

1620
01:48:50,906 --> 01:48:53,406
A question I now put to you.

1621
01:48:54,117 --> 01:48:58,157
Where should we be
at the end of all that?

1622
01:49:03,418 --> 01:49:05,248
Some might benefit.

1623
01:49:05,462 --> 01:49:09,632
I mean, the powerful might
be able to parlay good terms,

1624
01:49:09,716 --> 01:49:12,636
preserved in their country redoubts,

1625
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:17,099
out of sight of the swastika flying over

1626
01:49:17,182 --> 01:49:19,732
over Buckingham Palace!

1627
01:49:19,810 --> 01:49:21,850
Over Windsor!

1628
01:49:22,187 --> 01:49:24,687
And, draped on these very buildings!

1629
01:49:24,773 --> 01:49:26,573
- Never! Never!
- No! No!

1630
01:49:26,650 --> 01:49:28,650
So I come to you...

1631
01:49:30,362 --> 01:49:33,032
I come to you

1632
01:49:34,074 --> 01:49:38,044
to learn your minds in this grave hour.

1633
01:49:39,121 --> 01:49:42,041
You see, it was pointed out to me

1634
01:49:42,124 --> 01:49:46,254
by my new friends
that you might even rise up

1635
01:49:46,336 --> 01:49:49,336
and tear me down were I for one moment

1636
01:49:49,423 --> 01:49:51,423
to contemplate parlay or surrender.

1637
01:49:56,430 --> 01:49:57,680
Were they wrong?

1638
01:49:57,764 --> 01:49:59,064
No!

1639
01:49:59,141 --> 01:50:00,481
- Were they wrong?
- No!

1640
01:50:00,559 --> 01:50:02,229
Were they wrong?

1641
01:50:02,311 --> 01:50:04,191
- No!
- Thank you. Thank you.

1642
01:50:04,271 --> 01:50:05,731
Then I have heard you.

1643
01:50:06,190 --> 01:50:07,900
I have heard you.

1644
01:50:10,194 --> 01:50:14,074
It appears to be your will also

1645
01:50:14,615 --> 01:50:19,545
that if this long island story
of ours is to end at last,

1646
01:50:19,620 --> 01:50:23,460
then let it end only when each one of us

1647
01:50:23,707 --> 01:50:28,207
lies choking in his own blood
upon the ground!

1648
01:50:28,295 --> 01:50:31,265
- Yes!
- Bravo!

1649
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:32,630
Yes.

1650
01:50:35,135 --> 01:50:37,545
And when I asked
to know their minds,

1651
01:50:37,638 --> 01:50:39,508
there occurred a demonstration which,

1652
01:50:39,598 --> 01:50:41,808
considering the character
of the gathering,

1653
01:50:41,892 --> 01:50:43,692
quite surprised me.

1654
01:50:44,353 --> 01:50:48,823
There is no doubt that if we falter at all

1655
01:50:48,899 --> 01:50:50,729
in the leading of the nation,

1656
01:50:50,817 --> 01:50:53,607
we should all be hurled out of office.

1657
01:50:54,279 --> 01:50:55,819
I am sure now that every minister

1658
01:50:55,906 --> 01:50:57,276
on both sides of the House

1659
01:50:57,366 --> 01:50:59,866
is ready to be killed quite soon,

1660
01:50:59,952 --> 01:51:03,042
and have all his family
and possessions destroyed,

1661
01:51:03,121 --> 01:51:04,711
rather than give in.

1662
01:51:05,624 --> 01:51:09,344
In this, they represent
almost all the people.

1663
01:51:10,045 --> 01:51:14,795
And it falls to me
in these coming days and months

1664
01:51:15,259 --> 01:51:18,929
to express their sentiments.

1665
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:25,940
There shall be no negotiated peace.

1666
01:51:30,315 --> 01:51:32,685
And you must each do now

1667
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,990
as you see fit.

1668
01:51:39,825 --> 01:51:43,125
If you will excuse me, gentlemen

1669
01:51:43,203 --> 01:51:46,753
I believe I am due to address Parliament.

1670
01:51:47,249 --> 01:51:51,169
And I have yet to write
a word of my speech.

1671
01:51:51,253 --> 01:51:52,923
There's the buggers.

1672
01:51:56,258 --> 01:51:57,878
- Tiny.
- Sir.

1673
01:52:03,807 --> 01:52:05,847
- Miss Layton.
- Sir.

1674
01:52:06,351 --> 01:52:07,771
I am in need of you.

1675
01:52:10,189 --> 01:52:13,019
We must both now resign,
force a vote of no confidence.

1676
01:52:14,401 --> 01:52:16,991
Well, let us go to the Commons first,

1677
01:52:17,696 --> 01:52:18,776
join our colleagues.

1678
01:52:20,157 --> 01:52:23,737
Then speak after
the prime minister's address.

1679
01:52:43,096 --> 01:52:45,426
Here is a woman who's always tired,

1680
01:52:46,391 --> 01:52:50,191
for she lives a life
where too much is required.

1681
01:53:18,131 --> 01:53:20,381
The Prime Minister.

1682
01:53:29,685 --> 01:53:33,815
Turning once again
to the question of invasion,

1683
01:53:33,897 --> 01:53:37,977
I would observe that there
has never been a period

1684
01:53:38,068 --> 01:53:41,568
in all these long centuries
of which we boast

1685
01:53:41,655 --> 01:53:47,295
when an absolute guarantee
against invasion

1686
01:53:47,744 --> 01:53:50,664
could have been given to our people.

1687
01:53:51,540 --> 01:53:53,290
Hear, hear.

1688
01:53:57,588 --> 01:53:59,458
But I have myself

1689
01:54:00,382 --> 01:54:04,302
full confidence that if all do their duty,

1690
01:54:04,845 --> 01:54:07,395
if nothing is neglected,

1691
01:54:07,848 --> 01:54:09,428
and the best arrangements are made,

1692
01:54:09,516 --> 01:54:12,056
as they are being made,

1693
01:54:12,561 --> 01:54:15,441
we shall prove ourselves once more able

1694
01:54:15,522 --> 01:54:18,022
to defend our island home.

1695
01:54:18,108 --> 01:54:22,488
To ride out the storm of war

1696
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:26,410
and to outlive the menace of tyranny.

1697
01:54:26,491 --> 01:54:28,331
If necessary

1698
01:54:28,744 --> 01:54:32,584
for years, if necessary

1699
01:54:33,707 --> 01:54:34,917
alone.

1700
01:54:36,919 --> 01:54:39,549
At any rate, that is what we are

1701
01:54:39,630 --> 01:54:41,460
are going to try to do.

1702
01:54:42,007 --> 01:54:46,757
That is the resolve
of His Majesty's Government,

1703
01:54:46,845 --> 01:54:48,605
- every man of them.
- To your right, please.

1704
01:54:49,056 --> 01:54:51,266
That is the will

1705
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:53,730
of Parliament and the nation.

1706
01:54:53,810 --> 01:54:56,060
Hear, hear.

1707
01:54:56,939 --> 01:54:58,769
The British Empire

1708
01:54:58,857 --> 01:55:00,527
and the French Republic,

1709
01:55:00,609 --> 01:55:04,779
linked together
in their cause and in their need,

1710
01:55:05,072 --> 01:55:07,622
will defend to the death

1711
01:55:07,699 --> 01:55:09,619
their native soil.

1712
01:55:09,701 --> 01:55:11,041
Hear, hear!

1713
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:14,909
Aiding each other like good comrades

1714
01:55:15,374 --> 01:55:17,924
to the utmost of their strength.

1715
01:55:18,001 --> 01:55:19,091
Hear, hear.

1716
01:55:21,296 --> 01:55:25,426
Even though large tracts of Europe

1717
01:55:25,717 --> 01:55:27,757
and many old and famous states

1718
01:55:27,845 --> 01:55:32,145
have fallen or may fall into

1719
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:35,814
the grip of the Gestapo

1720
01:55:36,061 --> 01:55:40,271
and all the odious apparatus
of the Nazi rule,

1721
01:55:41,066 --> 01:55:43,896
we shall not flag or fail.

1722
01:55:45,195 --> 01:55:47,905
We shall go on to the end!

1723
01:55:47,990 --> 01:55:49,990
Hear, hear!

1724
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:56,080
We shall fight in France.

1725
01:55:56,790 --> 01:56:00,880
We shall fight
on the seas and the oceans.

1726
01:56:01,378 --> 01:56:05,088
We shall fight with growing confidence

1727
01:56:05,174 --> 01:56:07,134
and growing strengths in the air.

1728
01:56:07,217 --> 01:56:08,547
Hear, hear!

1729
01:56:08,635 --> 01:56:11,965
We shall defend our island,

1730
01:56:12,055 --> 01:56:14,675
whatever the cost may be.

1731
01:56:14,766 --> 01:56:16,886
Hear, hear.

1732
01:56:17,186 --> 01:56:20,146
We shall fight on the beaches.

1733
01:56:20,230 --> 01:56:23,940
We shall fight on the landing grounds.

1734
01:56:24,401 --> 01:56:27,491
We shall fight in the fields

1735
01:56:27,571 --> 01:56:29,821
and in the streets.

1736
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:33,080
We shall fight in the hills.

1737
01:56:33,493 --> 01:56:35,663
We shall never surrender!

1738
01:56:38,207 --> 01:56:41,037
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

1739
01:56:45,339 --> 01:56:46,799
And if...

1740
01:56:50,969 --> 01:56:52,599
And if

1741
01:56:54,097 --> 01:56:57,227
which I do not for a moment believe,

1742
01:56:57,476 --> 01:57:02,016
this island or large part of it were...

1743
01:57:02,105 --> 01:57:05,225
were subjugated and starving,

1744
01:57:05,943 --> 01:57:10,323
then our empire beyond the seas,

1745
01:57:10,405 --> 01:57:14,445
armed and guarded by the British fleet,

1746
01:57:14,952 --> 01:57:18,792
- would carry on the struggle.
- Hear, hear!

1747
01:57:19,373 --> 01:57:21,623
Until, in God's good time,

1748
01:57:22,125 --> 01:57:26,955
the New World,
with all its power and might,

1749
01:57:27,464 --> 01:57:30,184
steps forth to the rescue

1750
01:57:30,259 --> 01:57:33,009
and the liberation of the old!

1751
01:58:10,215 --> 01:58:11,835
Bravo!

1752
01:58:11,925 --> 01:58:13,335
Victory!

1753
01:58:14,553 --> 01:58:18,723
Victory! Victory!

1754
01:58:23,312 --> 01:58:24,902
Changed your mind?

1755
01:58:25,647 --> 01:58:27,517
Those who never change their mind

1756
01:58:27,983 --> 01:58:29,733
never change anything.

1757
01:58:32,988 --> 01:58:34,358
What just happened?

1758
01:58:35,449 --> 01:58:37,739
He mobilized the English language

1759
01:58:39,036 --> 01:58:40,946
and sent it into battle.
