1
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:42,431
Dad...

2
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:32,537
Clear the ramp! 30 seconds!
God be with you!

3
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:34,777
Port side, stick.
Starboard side, stick.

4
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,188
Move fast and clear
those mortar holes.

5
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:40,044
l want to see plenty
of beach between men.

6
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,989
Five men is an opportunity.
One is a waste of ammo.

7
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:46,359
Keep the sand
out of your weapons.

8
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:48,244
Keep those actions clear.

9
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,365
l'll see you on the beach.

10
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:25,403
Open mortar holes!

11
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:43,132
Over the side!

12
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:51,737
Port and starboard, over...

13
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:02,506
Jesus.

14
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:03,915
Thank you...

15
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:26,694
l said, what the hell
do we do now, sir?

16
00:10:28,312 --> 00:10:29,269
Captain Miller!

17
00:10:30,392 --> 00:10:31,349
Captain Miller!

18
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:34,337
Captain Miller!

19
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:37,247
Sergeant Horvath!

20
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,518
Move your men off the beach!

21
00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:41,223
Go!

22
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:43,255
OK, you guys!

23
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,291
Get on my ass! Follow me!

24
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,160
What's the rallying point?

25
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:50,281
Anywhere but here!

26
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:04,226
The sea wall!

27
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,846
Move up to the sea wall!

28
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:07,749
Sir, l'm staying!

29
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,918
Clear this beach!
Make way for the others!

30
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:13,283
This is all we got!

31
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:17,358
Every inch of this beach
has been pre-sighted!

32
00:11:17,482 --> 00:11:21,043
You stay here, you're dead men!

33
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:35,958
Mama!

34
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,663
Mama!

35
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:44,960
Stay down! Stay down!

36
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:51,152
What are you guys?

37
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,183
104th Medical Battalion, sir!

38
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:56,722
Here to set up field operations!

39
00:11:56,844 --> 00:11:58,648
Get rid of that crap!

40
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,982
Grab yourselves some weapons.
Follow me.

41
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:10,277
l'm hit!

42
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,522
Briggs!

43
00:12:16,674 --> 00:12:17,878
Get me out!

44
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,608
l'm hit low. God!

45
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,188
Medic!

46
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:24,220
Navy Beach Battalion, sir.

47
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,143
l gotta clear these obstacles
for the tanks.

48
00:12:27,271 --> 00:12:29,723
All the armour's
foundering in the Channel.

49
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:31,054
Orders, sir.

50
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:33,751
You go somewhere else.
l'm clearing this one!

51
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,000
Come on, Briggs!

52
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:41,344
Medic!

53
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:19,917
Move! Move!

54
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,055
Move! Come on!

55
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,511
Move!

56
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:53,995
Shore party.

57
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,990
No armour has made it ashore.

58
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:58,153
We got no DD tanks.

59
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:01,256
Dog One is not open.

60
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,786
Who's in command here?

61
00:14:03,913 --> 00:14:05,865
You are, sir!

62
00:14:06,741 --> 00:14:08,732
- Sergeant Horvath!
- Sir!

63
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:11,020
You recognise where we are?

64
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:14,510
Right where we're supposed to
be, but no one else is!

65
00:14:14,632 --> 00:14:17,167
Nobody's where
they're supposed to be.

66
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:18,934
Shore party.

67
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,601
First wave, ineffective.

68
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:27,097
We do not hold the beach. Say
again, we do not hold the beach.

69
00:14:27,223 --> 00:14:30,369
Sir, we got the leftovers
from Fox Company,

70
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:32,323
Able Company
and George Company!

71
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,601
Plus we got some Navy Demo guys
and a Beachmaster!

72
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:38,221
Shore party.

73
00:14:39,242 --> 00:14:40,660
Shore party.

74
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:49,136
Cat-F, Cat-F, C...

75
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:54,618
- Reiben here, sir!
- Anybody else?

76
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:56,281
Jackson, but that's about it.

77
00:14:56,406 --> 00:14:58,616
Mellish here.

78
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:00,840
Caparzo!
DeForest's back with Wade.

79
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:04,203
He's hurt so bad he says
he sprung 100 leaks.

80
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:06,406
Wade says he's all used up.

81
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,231
Find somebody you can help.

82
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:11,644
He's battalion surgeon, sir!

83
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,420
Get his attention.

84
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:17,502
Wade!

85
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:18,545
Yo, doc!

86
00:15:18,673 --> 00:15:21,020
Wade!

87
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:30,036
Get him off the beach.

88
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:32,322
l got it!
We stopped the bleeding!

89
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:34,960
We stopped the bleeding!

90
00:15:35,085 --> 00:15:36,498
Fuck!

91
00:15:36,624 --> 00:15:40,433
Just give us a fucking chance,
you son of a bitch!

92
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,471
Son of a fucking cocksucker!

93
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:45,043
Come on, Wade! lt's Mellish!

94
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:46,922
Wade!

95
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,876
We found Miller!
Let's move! Let's move!

96
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,990
Oh, God. Oh, God.

97
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,167
This is all?
This is all that's made it?

98
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:03,991
We got scattered
pretty bad, sir.

99
00:16:04,117 --> 00:16:05,947
There's bound to be more.

100
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,688
Not enough. This is not enough.

101
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:09,978
Dog One exit...

102
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,430
On the right.
Or is it left? Shit!

103
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,292
No, Vierville is west of us.
This is Dog One.

104
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,789
They're killing us!

105
00:16:17,914 --> 00:16:21,183
We don't have a fucking chance,
and that ain't fair!

106
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:23,507
Gather weapons and ammo!

107
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,209
Gather weapons and ammo!

108
00:16:26,334 --> 00:16:29,409
Come on,
drag 'em in off the sand!

109
00:16:38,094 --> 00:16:39,826
Hey, Reiben, Reiben, Reiben,

110
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:41,405
where's your BAR?

111
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,270
Bottom of the channel, sir.
Nearly drowned me.

112
00:16:44,393 --> 00:16:46,307
Find a replacement.

113
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:51,252
Bangalores!
Bring up some bangalores!

114
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:54,491
Grenades, grenades!

115
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,237
Get 'em over here!

116
00:16:58,906 --> 00:17:00,711
Bangalores up the line!

117
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:02,873
Bangalores up the line!

118
00:17:02,997 --> 00:17:05,238
Heads up!
Bangers coming your way!

119
00:17:05,364 --> 00:17:07,545
Come on, come on, come on!

120
00:17:07,672 --> 00:17:08,730
Jackson here, sir!

121
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:10,019
Reiben back, sir!

122
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,001
One more. Give me one more.

123
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:26,229
Oh, my God, it hurts!

124
00:17:26,314 --> 00:17:27,625
l'm gonna die!

125
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,139
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus!

126
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:31,342
Oh, my God!

127
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:34,413
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

128
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:36,205
Almost got it.

129
00:17:36,327 --> 00:17:37,285
Jesus!

130
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:40,141
Lucky bastard.

131
00:17:40,264 --> 00:17:42,505
Keep it moving. You got it?

132
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:46,166
God! God, help me!

133
00:17:46,288 --> 00:17:48,612
You're not gonna die.

134
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:51,441
You're fine. Don't look at it.

135
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:55,262
Bangalores! Clear the shingle!

136
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:59,562
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole!

137
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:15,235
We're in business! Defilade!

138
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,230
Other side of the hole!

139
00:18:30,014 --> 00:18:31,927
That's it! Let's go!

140
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,409
lnspected. Morphine.

141
00:18:40,596 --> 00:18:42,384
Routine.

142
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:49,280
Priority.

143
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:53,931
He's gone.

144
00:19:07,252 --> 00:19:09,231
Son of a...

145
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,411
Get in there.

146
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:12,864
Fuck. l can't move.

147
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:14,980
Mellish, give me your bayonet.

148
00:19:35,244 --> 00:19:37,449
Two MG-42s and two mortars.

149
00:19:37,573 --> 00:19:39,668
Add 20, left 30.

150
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:43,956
There's a little defilade,

151
00:19:44,081 --> 00:19:47,295
but it's the perfect position
if we get some armour.

152
00:19:47,423 --> 00:19:50,275
We gotta open up this draw!
Get this draw open.

153
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,352
Reiben, Mellish,
let's get into the war!

154
00:19:52,477 --> 00:19:55,507
Grab some cover and put
some fire on that crew.

155
00:19:55,632 --> 00:19:59,554
Davis, DeBernardo, Young, Valk,
get ready.

156
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,055
Covering fire!

157
00:20:06,885 --> 00:20:08,955
Go, go, go!

158
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:24,108
Goddamn firing squad.

159
00:20:24,232 --> 00:20:27,450
lt's the only way
we can get everybody out.

160
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:30,011
Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes!

161
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:31,922
You're next!

162
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:36,367
- Why not hand out blindfolds?
- All we'll do here is die.

163
00:20:36,492 --> 00:20:38,280
Covering fire!

164
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:42,713
Go, go, go!

165
00:20:42,837 --> 00:20:43,789
Come on!

166
00:20:43,914 --> 00:20:45,702
Come on! Come on!

167
00:20:45,826 --> 00:20:47,234
Go, Goddamit!

168
00:20:59,702 --> 00:21:01,168
Jackson.

169
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:02,252
Sir.

170
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,950
See that impact crater?

171
00:21:04,076 --> 00:21:05,155
Yes, sir.

172
00:21:05,282 --> 00:21:09,396
That should give complete
defilade from that machine gun.

173
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,724
Wait for my command.

174
00:21:17,082 --> 00:21:18,038
Go!

175
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:32,734
Captain, if your mother
saw that, she'd be very upset.

176
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,433
l thought you were my mother.

177
00:21:36,014 --> 00:21:38,968
Be not thou far from me,
O Lord.

178
00:21:43,478 --> 00:21:46,431
My God, l am sorry
for offending Thee.

179
00:21:48,882 --> 00:21:52,375
l detest my sins for having
offended Thee, O Lord.

180
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,575
Listen to me, Lord.

181
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,751
All my strength...

182
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,700
haste Thee to help me.

183
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:22,555
Dog One exit! Right here!

184
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,337
We're in business!

185
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:27,598
Move! Move!

186
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:09,763
Reiben.

187
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:12,303
- Let's go, sarge. Go!
- Reiben.

188
00:23:40,484 --> 00:23:41,983
Come on, Doyle!

189
00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:45,014
Sarge.

190
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,705
Flame!

191
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:53,572
Doyle, do it!

192
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,917
Don't shoot! Let 'em burn!

193
00:24:22,904 --> 00:24:25,188
''Comrade?'' You son of a bitch!

194
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:28,251
Lie down!

195
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:58,710
Cease fire! Cease fire!

196
00:24:58,834 --> 00:24:59,755
Cut it out!

197
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:02,353
Cut it out! Cease fire!

198
00:25:02,478 --> 00:25:04,925
Sugar Cane. Sugar Charlie Three.

199
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:08,109
Say again, Dog One is open.
Send in the dozers.

200
00:25:08,236 --> 00:25:11,785
l'm waiting
to tie in my flanks. Over.

201
00:25:11,908 --> 00:25:13,400
What?

202
00:25:16,354 --> 00:25:19,768
What? l'm sorry,
l can't understand you.

203
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:30,176
What'd he say? What'd he say?

204
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,167
''Look, l washed for supper.''

205
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,010
- Hey, Fish.
- Yeah?

206
00:25:48,136 --> 00:25:51,745
Look at this.
A Hitler Youth knife.

207
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:54,193
Now it's a Shabbat challah
cutter, right?

208
00:26:04,422 --> 00:26:06,003
Keep it moving!

209
00:27:06,336 --> 00:27:08,357
That's quite a view.

210
00:27:09,701 --> 00:27:11,199
Yes, it is.

211
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,687
Quite a view.

212
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:51,167
''Dear Mr Brian Boyd,

213
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,994
''no doubt you have
received information...''

214
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:54,278
''Dear Mrs Jensen...''

215
00:28:54,403 --> 00:28:55,942
''..the death of your son.''

216
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,731
''..no words
can relieve the grief...''

217
00:28:57,854 --> 00:29:00,106
''We have felt his loss
tremendously.''

218
00:29:00,232 --> 00:29:03,158
''He was a fine soldier...''

219
00:29:03,281 --> 00:29:04,860
''We were involved

220
00:29:04,986 --> 00:29:08,127
''in one of the most important
operations of this war.''

221
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:10,181
''Al held us all together.

222
00:29:10,306 --> 00:29:11,983
''He was always
first to volunteer...''

223
00:29:12,111 --> 00:29:13,768
''..came to a clearing

224
00:29:13,894 --> 00:29:15,515
''where 4,000 troops had passed.''

225
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:18,093
''Your husband served in a unit

226
00:29:18,218 --> 00:29:20,726
''whose dangerous duty is
to place itself beyond...''

227
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,726
''..we all cherish
and hold so dear.

228
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:27,759
''The loss of Lee and others
like him is a distinct blow.''

229
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:29,945
''l understand your desire

230
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:33,763
''to learn about circumstances
leading to his death.''

231
00:30:25,662 --> 00:30:29,104
Colonel, l've got something
you should know about.

232
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:34,180
These two men died in Normandy.

233
00:30:34,303 --> 00:30:36,175
This one at Omaha beach.

234
00:30:37,257 --> 00:30:38,628
Sean Ryan.

235
00:30:38,751 --> 00:30:40,969
This man at Utah.

236
00:30:42,271 --> 00:30:43,805
Peter Ryan.

237
00:30:47,647 --> 00:30:50,788
This man was killed
last week in New Guinea.

238
00:30:53,487 --> 00:30:54,940
Daniel...

239
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:56,313
Ryan.

240
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,185
The three are brothers, sir.

241
00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:00,185
l've just learned
that this afternoon

242
00:31:00,311 --> 00:31:02,741
their mother will get
all three telegrams.

243
00:31:07,071 --> 00:31:09,343
That's not all.
There's a fourth brother.

244
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:13,191
He parachuted in the night
before the invasion.

245
00:31:13,314 --> 00:31:15,143
He's somewhere in Normandy.

246
00:31:15,268 --> 00:31:18,512
- ls he alive?
- We don't know.

247
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:22,529
Come with me.

248
00:33:07,511 --> 00:33:10,031
'Goddamit.'

249
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:14,391
All four were in the 29th
Division, but we split them up

250
00:33:14,516 --> 00:33:17,426
after the Sullivan brothers died
on the Juneau.

251
00:33:17,552 --> 00:33:19,715
Any contact
with the fourth son, James?

252
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,142
No, sir. He was dropped about
15 miles inland near Neuville.

253
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:26,139
That's still deep
behind German lines.

254
00:33:26,265 --> 00:33:30,170
There's no way to know
where the hell he was dropped.

255
00:33:30,294 --> 00:33:34,739
First reports out of SHAEF said
the 101st is scattered to hell.

256
00:33:34,864 --> 00:33:36,776
There's misdrops
all over Normandy.

257
00:33:36,901 --> 00:33:40,481
Assuming Ryan survived
the jump, he could be anywhere.

258
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:43,117
ln fact, he's probably KlA.

259
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:47,118
And frankly, sir, we go sending
some sort of rescue mission,

260
00:33:47,244 --> 00:33:50,017
flat-hatting through swarms
of German reinforcements

261
00:33:50,141 --> 00:33:51,766
along our axis of advance,

262
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:53,630
they're gonna be KlA, too.

263
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,753
l have a letter here...

264
00:34:20,052 --> 00:34:24,147
written a long time ago
to a Mrs Bixby in Boston.

265
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:26,350
So bear with me.

266
00:34:29,002 --> 00:34:30,420
''Dear Madam,

267
00:34:30,543 --> 00:34:34,408
''l have been shown in the files
of the War Department

268
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,769
''a statement of the Adjutant
General of Massachusetts

269
00:34:37,891 --> 00:34:41,182
''that you are the mother
of five...

270
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,803
''sons who died gloriously
on the field of battle.

271
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:54,938
''l feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine

272
00:34:55,062 --> 00:34:58,056
''that would attempt
to beguile you from the grief

273
00:34:58,182 --> 00:35:02,152
''of a loss so overwhelming.

274
00:35:02,278 --> 00:35:04,735
''But l cannot refrain
from tendering to you

275
00:35:04,858 --> 00:35:08,161
''the consolation
that may be found

276
00:35:08,288 --> 00:35:12,798
''in the thanks of the republic
they died to save.

277
00:35:16,118 --> 00:35:18,114
''l pray that
Our Heavenly Father

278
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,117
''may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement

279
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:25,578
''and leave only the cherished
memory of the loved lost...

280
00:35:25,702 --> 00:35:28,387
''and the solemn pride
that must be yours

281
00:35:28,471 --> 00:35:30,774
''to have laid so costly
a sacrifice

282
00:35:30,898 --> 00:35:32,725
''upon the altar of freedom.

283
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:36,175
''Yours very sincerely

284
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,671
''Abraham Lincoln.''

285
00:35:57,284 --> 00:35:59,946
That boy is alive.

286
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,922
We are gonna send somebody
to find him...

287
00:36:03,877 --> 00:36:07,717
and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there.

288
00:36:07,843 --> 00:36:08,809
Yes, sir.

289
00:36:21,761 --> 00:36:24,619
We expected 32 tanks,
27 didn't make it.

290
00:36:24,744 --> 00:36:28,090
- Miller, Charlie Company.
- Go in, Captain.

291
00:36:28,215 --> 00:36:31,395
lf we don't off-load
those Shermans by 0600,

292
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,091
we'll have an entire division
stuck at Carentan

293
00:36:34,216 --> 00:36:36,128
with its pants
around its ankles.

294
00:36:36,253 --> 00:36:38,165
Well, you let me know.

295
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:41,924
Have Charlie Company hold
Vierville until we get there.

296
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,216
Yes, sir. Runner!

297
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:53,068
Airborne was supposed
to win an open door for us.

298
00:36:53,192 --> 00:36:55,977
They misdropped, scattered
everything into the wind.

299
00:36:56,101 --> 00:36:57,142
What's your situation?

300
00:36:57,265 --> 00:36:59,719
Yes, sir. Sector four is secure.

301
00:37:01,896 --> 00:37:04,064
We took out towed 88s

302
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:06,901
here, here...and here.

303
00:37:07,026 --> 00:37:08,663
They'd already gotten
four Shermans

304
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,757
and some deuce-and-a-halves.

305
00:37:10,881 --> 00:37:13,165
These two minefields
are one big one.

306
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:14,660
We tried going through,

307
00:37:14,785 --> 00:37:17,737
but it turned
into a high-density field...

308
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:19,151
little bit of everything.

309
00:37:19,275 --> 00:37:21,952
Spreng mine 44s,
pot mines, A-200s...

310
00:37:22,078 --> 00:37:26,159
the wooden bastards that the
mine detectors don't pick up.

311
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:30,146
This road here...
they placed Teller mine 43s,

312
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,978
l guess for our tanks...

313
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:35,091
from here
to the edge of the village.

314
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:37,793
So we marked 'em,
called the engineers.

315
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:39,165
Resistance?

316
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:41,125
We had higher
support expectations, sir.

317
00:37:41,251 --> 00:37:43,760
There was an understrength
company without artillery.

318
00:37:43,884 --> 00:37:47,013
Wehrmacht 346 lnfantry,
von Luck Kampfgruppe.

319
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,153
We ended up with 23 prisoners.

320
00:37:49,277 --> 00:37:51,408
We turned them over to MPs.

321
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,183
What about our casualties?

322
00:37:58,264 --> 00:37:59,387
Well...

323
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,139
the figures...

324
00:38:01,265 --> 00:38:03,732
were 35 dead...

325
00:38:03,855 --> 00:38:05,104
times two wounded.

326
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:10,196
They just...
didn't wanna give up those 88s.

327
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,146
lt was tough,
that's why you got it.

328
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:14,766
Yes, sir.

329
00:38:16,055 --> 00:38:17,137
John...

330
00:38:20,171 --> 00:38:22,391
l've got another one for you.

331
00:38:22,518 --> 00:38:25,555
- Yes, sir.
- Straight from the top.

332
00:38:31,916 --> 00:38:36,152
We're taking a squad to Neuville
on a public relations mission.

333
00:38:36,277 --> 00:38:38,189
You leading a squad?

334
00:38:38,314 --> 00:38:43,157
Some Private lost three brothers
and got a ticket home.

335
00:38:43,282 --> 00:38:44,529
How come Neuville?

336
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,168
They think he's part
of all those airborne misdrops.

337
00:38:48,294 --> 00:38:52,054
lt won't be easy finding one
particular soldier.

338
00:38:52,179 --> 00:38:54,834
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

339
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:56,332
What about the company?

340
00:38:56,457 --> 00:39:00,117
We take our pick,
the rest get folded into Baker.

341
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,790
Jesus Christ.

342
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:04,170
They took away your company?

343
00:39:04,294 --> 00:39:08,390
lt wasn't my company. lt was
the army's. So they told me.

344
00:39:08,517 --> 00:39:12,151
Give me Reiben on BAR, Jackson,
Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

345
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:13,952
Beasley's dead.

346
00:39:14,074 --> 00:39:17,234
All right, Mellish, then.
We got anybody speaks French?

347
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,771
Not that l know of.

348
00:39:19,896 --> 00:39:21,107
What about Talbot?

349
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,535
- This morning.
- Oh. All right.

350
00:39:23,657 --> 00:39:26,156
l'll try to dig up
another interpreter.

351
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,337
Assemble
at battalion motor pool.

352
00:39:28,463 --> 00:39:29,385
Yes, sir.

353
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,764
- What we doing?
- Listen up... What?

354
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:33,134
What we gonna do?

355
00:39:33,257 --> 00:39:36,958
You're going home with a hunk
of cheese in your ass, Caparzo.

356
00:39:37,082 --> 00:39:39,785
You like it in the ass.

357
00:39:39,908 --> 00:39:41,748
Attention!

358
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,172
As you were.

359
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:44,962
l'm looking for Corporal Upham,

360
00:39:45,087 --> 00:39:47,218
- Timothy E.
- l'm Upham, sir.

361
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:49,902
- You speak French and German?
- Yes, sir.

362
00:39:50,028 --> 00:39:50,947
Accent?

363
00:39:51,072 --> 00:39:53,916
A slight one in French.
My German's clean, sir.

364
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:56,579
You're reassigned to me.
Grab your gear.

365
00:39:56,704 --> 00:39:59,530
We're going to Neuville.
When was this updated?

366
00:39:59,655 --> 00:40:01,451
As of 0830, sir.

367
00:40:01,578 --> 00:40:02,998
Uh, sir...

368
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:04,749
These two axes advance south...

369
00:40:04,874 --> 00:40:06,753
Sir, there are Germans
in Neuville.

370
00:40:06,879 --> 00:40:12,355
- Yes, Corporal.
- Sir, a LOT of Germans.

371
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,931
You have a problem
with that, Corporal?

372
00:40:14,057 --> 00:40:18,297
No, l've never been in combat.
l make maps, translate...

373
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,298
l need someone who speaks
French and German.

374
00:40:21,422 --> 00:40:22,636
My guys were killed.

375
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,636
But l haven't held a weapon
since training, sir.

376
00:40:25,761 --> 00:40:29,073
- Did you fire the weapon?
- Yes, sir.

377
00:40:29,198 --> 00:40:31,663
- Then get your gear.
- Yes, sir.

378
00:40:33,404 --> 00:40:34,984
Sir, may l...

379
00:40:39,726 --> 00:40:42,064
May l bring my typewriter, sir?

380
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,493
Yes, sir.

381
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:53,667
Thank you very much, sir.

382
00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:56,247
- That a souvenir?
- No, sir.

383
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,950
Take your time, Corporal.

384
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:04,041
Look on the bright side,
Corporal.

385
00:41:04,165 --> 00:41:05,288
Yes, sir.

386
00:41:05,412 --> 00:41:09,309
For one thing...
you don't need to carry those.

387
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:10,737
You'll need that.

388
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,641
Need this. Yes, sir.
Don't need that...

389
00:42:12,749 --> 00:42:14,577
You want your head blown off?

390
00:42:14,703 --> 00:42:17,612
Don't fuckin' touch me
with those little rat claws.

391
00:42:17,737 --> 00:42:19,942
Get the fuck back in formation.

392
00:42:21,148 --> 00:42:23,828
l was wondering
where you're from, that's...

393
00:42:29,135 --> 00:42:30,646
Caparzo, is it?

394
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,225
Hey, drop dead, Corporal.

395
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,426
Got you.

396
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:38,016
And saluting the captain
makes him a target for Germans.

397
00:42:38,142 --> 00:42:41,472
So don't do it, especially
when l'm next to him.

398
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,230
Corporal, what's
your book about?

399
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:47,867
- Watch your rifle.
- Sorry.

400
00:42:47,992 --> 00:42:50,590
lt's supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhood

401
00:42:50,717 --> 00:42:52,628
that develop between
soldiers during war.

402
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:54,706
Brotherhood?

403
00:42:54,828 --> 00:42:56,574
What do you know
about brotherhood?

404
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,152
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

405
00:42:59,278 --> 00:43:01,486
Ask the captain where he's from.

406
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,032
Yeah, ask the captain.

407
00:43:03,157 --> 00:43:05,120
He'll tell you everything
you wanna know.

408
00:43:05,243 --> 00:43:08,006
You wanna explain
the math of this to me?

409
00:43:08,132 --> 00:43:12,641
Why risk the lives of the
eight of us to save one guy?

410
00:43:12,766 --> 00:43:15,424
20 degrees.
Anybody wanna answer?

411
00:43:15,508 --> 00:43:19,125
Reiben, think about
the poor bastard's mother.

412
00:43:19,249 --> 00:43:20,997
l got a mother, all right?

413
00:43:21,124 --> 00:43:23,613
l mean, you got a mother.
Sarge has got a mother.

414
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:26,910
Shit, l bet even
the captain's got a mother.

415
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:30,056
Well, not the captain,
but the rest of us.

416
00:43:30,181 --> 00:43:33,549
''Theirs not to reason why,
theirs but to do and die.''

417
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:39,203
What does that mean?
We're all supposed to die?

418
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:42,206
Upham's talking about
our duty as soldiers.

419
00:43:42,332 --> 00:43:43,585
Yes, sir.

420
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:46,255
We have orders to follow.
That supersedes everything,

421
00:43:46,381 --> 00:43:47,722
including your mothers.

422
00:43:47,847 --> 00:43:49,104
Thank you, sir.

423
00:43:49,229 --> 00:43:51,614
Even if you think
the mission's fubar, sir?

424
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:54,393
Especially if you think
the mission's fubar.

425
00:43:54,476 --> 00:43:55,931
What's ''fubar''?

426
00:43:56,057 --> 00:43:58,718
Oh, it's German. Yeah.

427
00:43:58,843 --> 00:44:01,047
Never heard of that.

428
00:44:01,173 --> 00:44:02,596
Sir...

429
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,976
l have an opinion
on this matter.

430
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,029
Well, by all means,
share it with the squad.

431
00:44:08,155 --> 00:44:10,250
Well, from my way
of thinking, sir,

432
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:13,037
this entire mission is
a serious misallocation

433
00:44:13,162 --> 00:44:15,031
of valuable military resources.

434
00:44:15,156 --> 00:44:16,819
Yeah. Go on.

435
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,982
Well, it seems to me, sir,

436
00:44:19,106 --> 00:44:22,443
that God made me
a fine instrument of warfare.

437
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:26,575
Reiben, pay attention.
This is the way to gripe!

438
00:44:26,701 --> 00:44:27,622
Continue, Jackson.

439
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:29,007
What l mean, sir,

440
00:44:29,131 --> 00:44:34,130
if you put me and this rifle
within one mile of Adolf Hitler

441
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,624
with a clear line
of sight, sir...

442
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:40,076
Pack your bags, fellas.
War's over. Amen.

443
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,620
Oh, that's brilliant,
bumpkin.

444
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:45,004
So, Captain, what about you?
You don't gripe at all?

445
00:44:45,128 --> 00:44:48,013
l don't gripe to you,
Reiben. l'm a captain.

446
00:44:48,139 --> 00:44:51,280
There's a chain of command.
Gripes go up, not down.

447
00:44:51,403 --> 00:44:56,097
You gripe to me, l gripe
to my superiors and so on.

448
00:44:56,222 --> 00:45:00,048
l don't gripe to you
or in front of you.

449
00:45:00,172 --> 00:45:02,010
l'm sorry, sir, but, uh...

450
00:45:02,136 --> 00:45:06,627
Let's say you weren't a captain.
What would you say then?

451
00:45:06,752 --> 00:45:08,051
Well, in that case,

452
00:45:08,177 --> 00:45:11,025
l'd say this is
an excellent mission, sir,

453
00:45:11,151 --> 00:45:13,016
with an extremely valuable
objective, sir,

454
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,635
worthy of
my best efforts, sir.

455
00:45:15,763 --> 00:45:18,212
Moreover...l feel
heartfelt sorrow

456
00:45:18,338 --> 00:45:20,998
for the mother
of Private James Ryan

457
00:45:21,128 --> 00:45:25,385
and will lay down my life
and the lives of my men,

458
00:45:25,509 --> 00:45:28,570
especially you, Reiben,
to ease her suffering.

459
00:45:29,697 --> 00:45:32,160
- He's good.
- l love him.

460
00:45:42,516 --> 00:45:43,604
Right.

461
00:46:25,527 --> 00:46:27,200
Thunder!

462
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:28,624
Flash!

463
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:30,007
Upham, over there.

464
00:46:30,135 --> 00:46:32,094
Reiben, you four go.

465
00:46:41,741 --> 00:46:43,326
Go, go, go, go, go.

466
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,421
You're a welcome sight.

467
00:46:50,547 --> 00:46:52,006
Our relief showed up.

468
00:46:52,129 --> 00:46:53,623
How many are you?

469
00:46:53,747 --> 00:46:56,118
Just eight. We're not
your relief. Sorry.

470
00:46:56,242 --> 00:46:57,989
What do you mean, sir?

471
00:46:58,114 --> 00:47:00,026
We're here for a Private Ryan.

472
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,819
Who? Ryan? What for?

473
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,327
- ls he here?
- l don't know.

474
00:47:04,452 --> 00:47:10,393
Maybe on the other side of town.
The Germans cut us in two.

475
00:47:10,518 --> 00:47:14,218
- What's his name again?
- Ryan. James Ryan.

476
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:15,632
He dropped in with 101st.

477
00:47:15,757 --> 00:47:18,419
- Goldman, get me a runner.
- Runner!

478
00:47:18,543 --> 00:47:19,832
Come on.

479
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:26,050
Jonesy, make a hole there!

480
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,034
We got stopped by intense rifle
action from the eastward.

481
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,983
The Germans have been
reinforcing regiments all day.

482
00:47:34,108 --> 00:47:36,477
lt's been quiet
for about 45 minutes.

483
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:39,971
Most of the German fire
is concentrated to the westward.

484
00:47:40,095 --> 00:47:41,595
Who's on the loudspeaker?

485
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:43,015
That's Dagwood Düsseldorf,

486
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,814
our friendly neighbourhood
morale officer.

487
00:47:45,898 --> 00:47:47,990
The Statue of Liberty is kaputt.

488
00:47:48,117 --> 00:47:51,630
''The Statue of Liberty
is kaputt.''

489
00:47:51,757 --> 00:47:53,248
That's disconcerting.

490
00:47:56,534 --> 00:47:57,988
Take the second left...

491
00:47:58,113 --> 00:48:01,986
Your father was circumcised
by my rabbi, you prick!

492
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:04,994
Private Ryan, James,
probably misdropped with 101 .

493
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,000
- Got that?
- Cover!

494
00:48:14,509 --> 00:48:15,840
Go!

495
00:48:39,536 --> 00:48:41,282
Those sadistic fuckin' animals!

496
00:48:41,407 --> 00:48:42,326
Get down.

497
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:45,586
They know we're not in contact,
they'll get the runners.

498
00:48:45,711 --> 00:48:47,175
Why keep shooting him?

499
00:48:47,303 --> 00:48:50,024
Long as he lives,
he carries the message.

500
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,608
- We'd do the same.
- We wouldn't!

501
00:48:52,733 --> 00:48:56,265
- Get ready to travel.
- Yes, sir.

502
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:59,631
Try again to let Captain Hamill
know we're coming.

503
00:48:59,757 --> 00:49:01,003
What's the rest
of Neuville like?

504
00:49:01,131 --> 00:49:04,975
Uh, next block's got
two-storey buildings both sides.

505
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:08,363
A lotta windows
and a square on the left.

506
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:10,917
- Show me.
- Sarge, hold right here.

507
00:49:11,043 --> 00:49:12,042
Yes, sir.

508
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:19,578
Let's stay out of this enfilade
and use the buildings.

509
00:49:19,703 --> 00:49:22,620
Try a left hook.
Two of yours, two of mine.

510
00:49:22,745 --> 00:49:24,753
Hastings, Goldman, up front!

511
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:27,430
Reiben, Caparzo.

512
00:49:27,555 --> 00:49:29,355
Fundamentals. Short runs.

513
00:49:29,481 --> 00:49:31,863
High and low at the corners.

514
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:34,229
Be prepared for close contact.

515
00:49:34,354 --> 00:49:37,596
Go. Upham,
stay with Sergeant Horvath.

516
00:49:37,722 --> 00:49:38,803
Stay right here.

517
00:49:38,928 --> 00:49:40,591
l'll wear him like underwear!

518
00:49:40,715 --> 00:49:41,756
Stay with me.

519
00:49:50,165 --> 00:49:53,202
Past the end
are the gates to the square.

520
00:49:53,328 --> 00:49:54,284
Good.

521
00:50:02,147 --> 00:50:03,776
Reiben,
where's the Captain from?

522
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,620
Figure that out,
you got yourself a prize.

523
00:50:06,746 --> 00:50:08,044
300 bucks, l heard.

524
00:50:08,169 --> 00:50:11,767
Company's got a pool.
Five bucks gets you in.

525
00:50:15,172 --> 00:50:16,543
Easy.

526
00:50:18,168 --> 00:50:21,932
lt's around this corner.
Defilade up to those gates.

527
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,903
Somebody must know
where he's from.

528
00:50:26,028 --> 00:50:29,418
Been with him since Kasserine
Pass, and l don't know.

529
00:50:29,545 --> 00:50:31,052
My ankles are killing me.

530
00:50:31,179 --> 00:50:34,002
l'll need a wheelchair
before this is over.

531
00:50:34,128 --> 00:50:36,622
Ow! That's it. Oh, my God.

532
00:50:36,747 --> 00:50:38,618
Got ankles like an old woman.

533
00:50:38,743 --> 00:50:39,989
Like an old...

534
00:50:43,157 --> 00:50:44,410
Reiben.

535
00:50:44,536 --> 00:50:46,629
So you don't even know
where he went to school?

536
00:50:46,756 --> 00:50:48,638
Captain didn't go to school,

537
00:50:48,765 --> 00:50:51,567
they assembled him
out of Gl body parts.

538
00:50:51,692 --> 00:50:53,018
Pay attention to detail.

539
00:50:53,144 --> 00:50:56,593
l know where he's from 'cause
l pay attention to detail.

540
00:50:56,718 --> 00:50:58,006
Hey, Upham...

541
00:50:58,131 --> 00:51:00,710
careful you don't step
in the bullshit.

542
00:51:05,932 --> 00:51:06,978
Do it.

543
00:51:07,102 --> 00:51:08,023
Thunder!

544
00:51:08,147 --> 00:51:10,618
Thunder, or we will fire on you!

545
00:51:20,892 --> 00:51:22,977
Upham, tell them
to show themselves.

546
00:51:35,954 --> 00:51:38,784
Ask where the Germans are.

547
00:51:43,113 --> 00:51:44,577
What's he saying?

548
00:51:44,702 --> 00:51:45,959
The children.

549
00:51:46,084 --> 00:51:47,130
Take the children.

550
00:51:47,256 --> 00:51:49,726
No, we can't take the kids.

551
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:53,807
We can't take the kids! No!

552
00:51:56,096 --> 00:51:58,963
They think
they'll be safe with us.

553
00:51:59,089 --> 00:52:01,751
lt's not gonna be safe with us!

554
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:04,572
Are you nuts?!
Listen to the Captain!

555
00:52:04,698 --> 00:52:07,084
They think
they'll be safe, sir.

556
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,050
Not gonna be safe anywhere.

557
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:12,018
Put that kid back!

558
00:52:15,175 --> 00:52:17,421
Put that little girl back!

559
00:52:17,545 --> 00:52:19,582
Caparzo,
give that kid back now!

560
00:52:19,706 --> 00:52:22,412
Upham, how do you say
''lt's OK''?

561
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,627
She reminds me of my niece, sir.

562
00:52:24,753 --> 00:52:26,596
Get the kid back up there!

563
00:52:26,722 --> 00:52:30,530
Captain, we could take her
down the road to the next town.

564
00:52:30,655 --> 00:52:32,032
We're not here
to do the decent thing!

565
00:52:32,156 --> 00:52:33,734
We're here to follow
fuckin' orders!

566
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,815
Sarge, take this goddamn kid!

567
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,945
Cover! Cover!

568
00:52:47,378 --> 00:52:48,678
Come on. No!

569
00:52:48,801 --> 00:52:50,728
Goddamit!
Where'd that come from?

570
00:52:53,141 --> 00:52:55,468
He was on the ground
before we heard.

571
00:53:01,497 --> 00:53:02,830
That's where l'd be.

572
00:53:05,131 --> 00:53:06,389
l didn't see it.

573
00:53:06,514 --> 00:53:09,025
450 yards, Captain.
Maybe a shade under.

574
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:11,034
l wouldn't venture
out there, fellas!

575
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:13,487
This sniper's got talent!

576
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:21,595
Please don't cry. l'll take you
back to your parents.

577
00:53:21,718 --> 00:53:23,639
Please don't cry. Come on.

578
00:53:39,529 --> 00:53:40,443
Captain.

579
00:53:40,569 --> 00:53:42,818
Hold on, Caparzo.

580
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:43,987
Help me up.

581
00:53:44,111 --> 00:53:45,745
l can walk. l can walk.

582
00:53:45,872 --> 00:53:47,568
Caparzo, stay still!

583
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:56,863
All right.

584
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,852
Two clicks, left wind.

585
00:54:14,174 --> 00:54:17,293
Captain, can you see him
from there? How is he?

586
00:54:17,418 --> 00:54:19,579
Wade, you stay put.

587
00:54:19,704 --> 00:54:21,076
Where's he shot, Captain?

588
00:54:23,241 --> 00:54:26,047
- Can you see him?
- Stay there!

589
00:54:26,176 --> 00:54:28,602
Damn it, stay down!

590
00:54:28,726 --> 00:54:30,023
What's up with you?

591
00:54:30,147 --> 00:54:33,442
What if you get hit? Huh?

592
00:54:33,564 --> 00:54:35,479
Fish, come over here.

593
00:54:35,601 --> 00:54:37,388
Carpy, put your head down.

594
00:54:37,516 --> 00:54:39,218
Put your head down.

595
00:54:47,777 --> 00:54:50,789
O my God, l trust in Thee.

596
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:53,827
Let me not be ashamed.

597
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:56,946
Let not my enemies
triumph over me.

598
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:08,001
Copy it.

599
00:55:08,126 --> 00:55:10,469
Copy it and send it for me.

600
00:55:10,594 --> 00:55:12,968
You're gonna send it.
Put it down!

601
00:55:13,092 --> 00:55:15,379
- lt's got blood!
- l see it.

602
00:55:20,162 --> 00:55:23,199
lt's... lt's to my dad.

603
00:55:23,325 --> 00:55:24,871
lt's got blood on it.

604
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:54,556
We got him.

605
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,679
Stay down.

606
00:56:03,725 --> 00:56:05,567
How bad is it?

607
00:56:05,694 --> 00:56:07,957
Chest, maybe lung shot.

608
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:26,085
Get that 30 up the street!

609
00:56:31,148 --> 00:56:32,605
Detail!

610
00:56:32,732 --> 00:56:34,018
Clear up!

611
00:56:34,144 --> 00:56:35,681
Clear down!

612
00:56:50,367 --> 00:56:52,496
That's why
we can't take children.

613
00:56:59,103 --> 00:57:02,597
Sergeant Horvath,
do an ammo check.

614
00:57:02,723 --> 00:57:05,398
Upham... canteens.

615
00:57:05,523 --> 00:57:06,743
Fill 'em up.

616
00:57:06,867 --> 00:57:09,043
- Sergeant Hill.
- Yes, sir.

617
00:57:09,168 --> 00:57:13,505
Gather your men. We'll form up
at the north-west corner.

618
00:57:15,813 --> 00:57:18,559
Mellish, check the tower.

619
00:57:18,683 --> 00:57:20,055
Right now. Go!

620
00:57:31,964 --> 00:57:33,293
Fuck Ryan.

621
00:57:44,152 --> 00:57:46,625
- Thunder!
- Flash!

622
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,049
Come on in.

623
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,218
Hey, guys, we're looking
for Captain Hamill.

624
00:57:55,342 --> 00:57:57,047
Somewhere across the square.

625
00:57:57,171 --> 00:57:58,628
Across the square.

626
00:57:58,751 --> 00:58:00,996
Go easy. Watch for snipers.

627
00:58:01,123 --> 00:58:03,076
Take it easy. Sit down.

628
00:58:19,515 --> 00:58:22,634
Jimmy T, find Captain Hamill,
bring him in here.

629
00:58:22,758 --> 00:58:23,968
What? Up there?

630
00:58:24,096 --> 00:58:27,030
How should l know?
Would you go look, please?

631
00:58:27,154 --> 00:58:28,453
Thank you, you moron.

632
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:32,047
All right.

633
00:58:32,174 --> 00:58:35,743
You guys just flake out
here for a while.

634
00:58:37,324 --> 00:58:40,069
Let me get this goddamn
hitchhiker out of my boot.

635
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,222
Jesus!

636
00:58:50,347 --> 00:58:52,436
Drop your weapons!

637
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:53,639
Drop 'em now!

638
00:58:53,762 --> 00:58:55,010
Drop the fucking weapons!

639
00:58:59,001 --> 00:59:00,855
l'll shoot you! l'll shoot!

640
00:59:00,979 --> 00:59:02,474
Drop! Drop! Drop 'em!

641
00:59:05,609 --> 00:59:07,373
Now! Put 'em down!

642
00:59:22,755 --> 00:59:24,049
Clear up!

643
00:59:29,158 --> 00:59:30,247
Shit.

644
00:59:30,372 --> 00:59:31,877
Shit!

645
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,290
Clear up!

646
00:59:34,578 --> 00:59:36,075
Clear down!

647
00:59:48,546 --> 00:59:50,177
Enough to make you old.

648
00:59:51,389 --> 00:59:52,722
Let's hope so.

649
01:00:02,616 --> 01:00:03,991
Fred Hamill, Pathfinders 101st.

650
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:06,003
John Miller, 2nd Rangers.

651
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:08,141
Thank you.

652
01:00:08,267 --> 01:00:10,483
We're looking for
Private James Ryan.

653
01:00:10,609 --> 01:00:14,358
He's part of your outfit.
Any chance you policed him up?

654
01:00:14,481 --> 01:00:17,639
- How was the road in?
- Scenic.

655
01:00:17,764 --> 01:00:19,719
We lost most of our ammo.

656
01:00:19,842 --> 01:00:21,964
And one of our men.

657
01:00:22,088 --> 01:00:25,386
Lieutenant, redeploy that
bazooka to the right side.

658
01:00:25,514 --> 01:00:26,608
Yes, sir!

659
01:00:26,731 --> 01:00:28,616
And get Ryan up here.

660
01:00:30,162 --> 01:00:31,585
Ryan!

661
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:33,994
Ryan, front and centre!

662
01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:35,740
Ryan!

663
01:00:39,151 --> 01:00:40,565
Here comes our boy.

664
01:00:47,983 --> 01:00:50,074
Told you he was an asshole.

665
01:00:52,453 --> 01:00:54,031
Sir, Private Ryan reporting.

666
01:00:54,156 --> 01:00:55,611
At ease.

667
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:59,187
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers.
He wants a word with you.

668
01:01:00,933 --> 01:01:03,011
This way.

669
01:01:03,137 --> 01:01:04,600
All right.

670
01:01:04,725 --> 01:01:06,067
Take a knee.

671
01:01:15,209 --> 01:01:17,870
Private, l have some bad news.

672
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:30,352
Well, there isn't any easy
way to say this, so, uh...

673
01:01:32,232 --> 01:01:36,013
so l'll just say it -
your brothers are dead.

674
01:01:36,138 --> 01:01:41,833
We have, uh, orders
to come get you...

675
01:01:41,957 --> 01:01:43,413
'cause you're going home.

676
01:01:57,896 --> 01:02:00,351
Oh, my God.
My brothers are dead.

677
01:02:06,361 --> 01:02:10,463
l was gonna take 'em fishing
when we got home.

678
01:02:25,702 --> 01:02:27,174
l'm so sorry, James.

679
01:02:27,301 --> 01:02:29,747
l can't tell you how much.

680
01:02:29,872 --> 01:02:32,628
How...how did they die?

681
01:02:32,754 --> 01:02:35,579
They were killed in action.

682
01:02:35,703 --> 01:02:39,794
No, that can't be.
They're both...

683
01:02:39,919 --> 01:02:41,996
That...that can't be.

684
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:46,051
My brothers are still
in grammar school.

685
01:02:47,729 --> 01:02:49,734
You're James Ryan?

686
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,491
Yeah.

687
01:02:51,616 --> 01:02:54,777
James Francis Ryan from lowa?

688
01:02:54,902 --> 01:02:57,644
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

689
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:06,693
Well, does that...does that
mean my brothers are OK?

690
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,622
Yeah, l'm sure they're fine.

691
01:03:08,748 --> 01:03:10,670
Are you sure they're OK,
though?

692
01:03:10,796 --> 01:03:13,709
We're looking for
a different Private Ryan.

693
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:15,580
How do you know?

694
01:03:15,704 --> 01:03:17,826
How do you know the foul-up

695
01:03:17,951 --> 01:03:20,445
isn't that his brothers
are OK and that...

696
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:22,731
Lieutenant,
l'm sorry for the trouble.

697
01:03:22,854 --> 01:03:27,672
l just wrote them a letter...
l got to get home.

698
01:03:27,796 --> 01:03:31,436
l got to get home right now.

699
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:33,143
Shh, take it easy.

700
01:03:33,266 --> 01:03:35,553
- Where's our Ryan?
- l don't know.

701
01:03:35,676 --> 01:03:37,300
You in touch with your CO?

702
01:03:37,423 --> 01:03:40,084
- That figures.
- What unit's he in?

703
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:41,664
Baker Company, 506.

704
01:03:41,787 --> 01:03:44,958
- The guy with the broken foot?
- Charlie, l think.

705
01:03:45,083 --> 01:03:46,257
You think? Yeah.

706
01:03:46,385 --> 01:03:49,109
Ryan? Don't know... Man!

707
01:03:49,234 --> 01:03:51,366
Where was your drop zone?

708
01:03:51,491 --> 01:03:52,824
Just inside of Vierville.

709
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:55,815
Vierville?
How did you end up here?

710
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,024
You got me, sir.

711
01:03:57,148 --> 01:03:58,976
C-47 took heavy fire.

712
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:02,051
Pilot tried to get out,
turning every which way.

713
01:04:02,174 --> 01:04:06,145
Took more fire in the drop.
Got messy. l ended up here.

714
01:04:06,271 --> 01:04:09,623
l haven't seen a single guy
from my stick, sir.

715
01:04:09,748 --> 01:04:13,318
Anybody there have a big mouth,
say where the drop was?

716
01:04:13,442 --> 01:04:16,977
No, sir, but they had
the same rally point as us.

717
01:04:17,102 --> 01:04:18,929
Show me.

718
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:20,551
My men are beat.

719
01:04:20,675 --> 01:04:24,672
We'll hold up for three hours
then pull out after dark.

720
01:04:24,797 --> 01:04:28,699
Got anything left in this town
like a three-star hotel?

721
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:31,624
Something with clean sheets
and room service?

722
01:04:31,749 --> 01:04:33,621
How about a nice comfy church?

723
01:04:33,746 --> 01:04:36,032
- We'll take that.
- Any news?

724
01:04:36,157 --> 01:04:37,612
How's it all falling together?

725
01:04:37,736 --> 01:04:39,567
Well, we got
the beachhead secure.

726
01:04:39,691 --> 01:04:42,393
Problem is Monty's taking
his time moving on Caen.

727
01:04:42,516 --> 01:04:45,022
We can't pull out
till he's ready, so...

728
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:46,111
That guy's overrated.

729
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:47,499
No argument here.

730
01:04:47,624 --> 01:04:50,342
You got to take Caen
so you can take Saint-Lo.

731
01:04:50,468 --> 01:04:52,429
Take Saint-Lo to take Valognes.

732
01:04:52,554 --> 01:04:54,049
Valognes, you got Cherbourg.

733
01:04:54,175 --> 01:04:55,588
And Cherbourg, you got Paris.

734
01:04:55,712 --> 01:04:57,999
Paris, you get Berlin.

735
01:04:58,124 --> 01:05:00,079
Then that big boat home.

736
01:05:02,238 --> 01:05:05,160
We sure could
use you around here,

737
01:05:05,288 --> 01:05:07,052
but l understand
what you're doing.

738
01:05:07,178 --> 01:05:08,306
You do?

739
01:05:08,433 --> 01:05:11,651
Yeah. l got a couple
of brothers myself.

740
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:14,062
- Oh.
- Good luck.

741
01:05:14,187 --> 01:05:15,273
Thank you.

742
01:05:15,396 --> 01:05:17,018
No, l mean it.

743
01:05:17,144 --> 01:05:19,636
Find him. Get him home.

744
01:05:27,861 --> 01:05:30,117
What's with your hand?

745
01:05:30,242 --> 01:05:32,496
l don't know.

746
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,903
lt started when they brought
us down for embarkation.

747
01:05:38,027 --> 01:05:39,444
lt comes and goes.

748
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:42,722
You may have to get
yourself a new job.

749
01:05:42,846 --> 01:05:46,026
This one doesn't seem
to agree with you any more.

750
01:05:51,306 --> 01:05:52,427
What?

751
01:05:56,294 --> 01:05:58,495
- What?
- Nothing.

752
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:01,493
What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?

753
01:06:01,616 --> 01:06:04,569
He was always walking around
on his hands,

754
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:08,596
and singing that song about
the man on the flying trapeze?

755
01:06:17,096 --> 01:06:18,426
Yeah, Vecchio.

756
01:06:18,551 --> 01:06:20,879
He was a goofy kid.

757
01:06:21,004 --> 01:06:25,171
Remember he used to pee
a ''V'' on everybody's jacket,

758
01:06:25,297 --> 01:06:27,357
for Vecchio.

759
01:06:27,481 --> 01:06:28,736
For victory.

760
01:06:28,861 --> 01:06:30,157
Vecchio.

761
01:06:33,037 --> 01:06:34,365
He was so short.

762
01:06:34,489 --> 01:06:38,315
- Wasn't he a midget?
- How did he become a Ranger?

763
01:06:40,977 --> 01:06:43,179
Got shot in the foot once.

764
01:06:43,306 --> 01:06:45,689
He could walk faster
on his hands.

765
01:06:47,747 --> 01:06:50,336
He could run faster
on his hands than...

766
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:12,641
You see, when...you end up
killing one of your men,

767
01:07:12,768 --> 01:07:15,813
you tell yourself it happened

768
01:07:15,936 --> 01:07:22,991
so you could save the lives
of two or three or 10 others.

769
01:07:23,118 --> 01:07:25,038
Maybe a hundred others.

770
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:32,329
Do you know how many men
l've lost under my command?

771
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:35,709
- How many?
- 94.

772
01:07:35,831 --> 01:07:39,436
But that means
l've saved the lives

773
01:07:39,568 --> 01:07:41,800
of 10 times that many,
doesn't it?

774
01:07:41,923 --> 01:07:44,863
Maybe even 20, right?

775
01:07:44,986 --> 01:07:46,343
20 times as many?

776
01:07:52,164 --> 01:07:54,365
And that's how simple it is.

777
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:57,597
That's how you...

778
01:07:57,745 --> 01:08:00,844
That's how you rationalise
making the choice

779
01:08:00,966 --> 01:08:04,101
between the mission and the men.

780
01:08:04,225 --> 01:08:07,144
Except this time,
this mission is a man.

781
01:08:10,629 --> 01:08:13,041
This Ryan better be worth it.

782
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:18,988
He'd better go home
and cure some disease

783
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:22,976
or invent a longer-lasting
light bulb or something.

784
01:08:23,098 --> 01:08:27,954
l wouldn't trade 10 Ryans
for one Vecchio or one Caparzo.

785
01:08:28,106 --> 01:08:29,876
Amen.

786
01:08:31,057 --> 01:08:34,137
Look. There it goes again.

787
01:08:34,278 --> 01:08:35,544
Sir...

788
01:08:35,666 --> 01:08:38,556
are you all right?

789
01:08:43,075 --> 01:08:45,952
Look, we're gonna
move out in two hours.

790
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,840
Why don't you get some sleep?

791
01:08:47,968 --> 01:08:50,664
l don't know how he does it.

792
01:08:50,788 --> 01:08:52,022
What's that?

793
01:08:52,149 --> 01:08:54,745
Falls asleep like that.
Look at him.

794
01:08:54,868 --> 01:08:57,639
He's lights-out
the minute his head's down.

795
01:08:57,762 --> 01:08:59,064
Clear conscience.

796
01:08:59,187 --> 01:09:03,748
What's that saying? ''lf God's
on our side, who's on theirs?''

797
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:07,115
''lf God be for us,
who could be against us?''

798
01:09:07,238 --> 01:09:08,620
Yeah, what did l say?

799
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,117
Well, actually,

800
01:09:10,244 --> 01:09:13,583
the trick to falling asleep
is trying to stay awake.

801
01:09:13,706 --> 01:09:15,539
How is that, Wade?

802
01:09:15,661 --> 01:09:20,290
My mother was an intern,
she worked late nights,

803
01:09:20,415 --> 01:09:22,242
slept through the day,

804
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:26,572
so the only time we got to talk
was when she'd get home.

805
01:09:26,698 --> 01:09:31,268
So l used to lie in my bed
and try to stay awake,

806
01:09:31,394 --> 01:09:34,758
but it never worked
'cause the harder l tried,

807
01:09:34,883 --> 01:09:36,878
the faster l'd fall asleep.

808
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:40,121
That wouldn't have
mattered in my house.

809
01:09:40,245 --> 01:09:43,534
My ma would've shook me awake,
chatted till dawn.

810
01:09:43,658 --> 01:09:46,627
That woman
was never too tired to talk.

811
01:09:46,754 --> 01:09:50,189
Probably the only time
she could get a word in.

812
01:09:53,943 --> 01:09:58,846
Funny thing is,
sometimes she'd come home early,

813
01:09:58,971 --> 01:10:01,341
and l'd pretend to be asleep.

814
01:10:01,467 --> 01:10:04,171
Who? You...your mom?

815
01:10:04,295 --> 01:10:05,424
Yeah.

816
01:10:07,608 --> 01:10:10,456
She'd stand in the doorway
looking at me.

817
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:14,079
And l'd just keep my eyes shut.

818
01:10:16,411 --> 01:10:20,403
l knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,

819
01:10:20,527 --> 01:10:22,270
that she came home early...

820
01:10:24,645 --> 01:10:27,370
just to talk to me.

821
01:10:29,131 --> 01:10:30,845
And l still wouldn't move.

822
01:10:30,971 --> 01:10:33,469
l'd still pretend
to just be asleep.

823
01:10:41,163 --> 01:10:44,700
l don't know why l did that.

824
01:10:56,937 --> 01:11:00,676
We only got a couple hours.
Go to sleep.

825
01:11:09,206 --> 01:11:12,645
Captain? Sir?

826
01:11:14,225 --> 01:11:15,643
Corporal?

827
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:23,996
How you doin' there?
You all right?

828
01:11:24,121 --> 01:11:28,440
Yeah, l think this is
all good for me, sir.

829
01:11:28,566 --> 01:11:30,907
Really?

830
01:11:31,033 --> 01:11:33,034
How is that?

831
01:11:36,195 --> 01:11:38,855
''War educates the senses,

832
01:11:38,939 --> 01:11:40,892
''calls into action the will,

833
01:11:41,018 --> 01:11:44,053
''perfects the physical
constitution,

834
01:11:44,178 --> 01:11:47,112
''brings men into such
swift and close collision

835
01:11:47,237 --> 01:11:50,504
''in critical moments
that man measures man.''

836
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:53,298
Yeah, well, l guess
that's Emerson's way

837
01:11:53,422 --> 01:11:55,378
of finding the bright side.

838
01:11:55,502 --> 01:11:59,743
- You know Emerson, sir?
- l know some.

839
01:12:03,523 --> 01:12:08,048
So where are you from, Captain?
What'd you do before the war?

840
01:12:09,682 --> 01:12:11,686
What's the pool up to?

841
01:12:15,432 --> 01:12:19,092
You know, l think
it's around 300, sir.

842
01:12:19,217 --> 01:12:21,626
Well, when it gets up to 500,

843
01:12:21,751 --> 01:12:26,005
l'll tell you and we'll split
the money, how about that?

844
01:12:26,131 --> 01:12:30,071
Well, sir, l feel it's my duty
under your command

845
01:12:30,196 --> 01:12:34,198
to suggest we wait until
it gets to a thousand, sir.

846
01:12:36,111 --> 01:12:38,772
What if we don't
live that long?

847
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:44,652
- 500?
- 500 would be good, yeah.

848
01:12:44,776 --> 01:12:45,701
Yes, sir.

849
01:12:45,826 --> 01:12:47,171
Yeah.

850
01:12:49,352 --> 01:12:51,063
Get some sleep, Corporal.

851
01:12:51,189 --> 01:12:52,187
Yes, sir.

852
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:00,196
Who's got sulphur powder?

853
01:14:03,269 --> 01:14:05,610
Medic! My buddy's bleeding!

854
01:14:05,737 --> 01:14:07,038
He needs a tourniquet!

855
01:14:07,164 --> 01:14:09,136
- Wade.
- Yes, sir?

856
01:14:09,261 --> 01:14:11,641
- Do what you can.
- Yes, sir.

857
01:14:11,766 --> 01:14:13,141
Hold on, fellas.

858
01:14:13,268 --> 01:14:14,722
lt won't be much longer.

859
01:14:14,846 --> 01:14:17,302
How we doing here?

860
01:14:17,426 --> 01:14:18,755
All right.

861
01:14:18,879 --> 01:14:21,210
Yeah, doing all right.
Don't worry about it.

862
01:14:21,335 --> 01:14:23,283
Doc's in town.

863
01:14:23,409 --> 01:14:24,699
lt's all right.
lt's all right.

864
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:28,728
The 29th lnfantry's breaking
through, they'll be here soon.

865
01:14:28,854 --> 01:14:31,154
Plasma. Anybody got plasma?

866
01:14:31,281 --> 01:14:35,193
- Captain. Hey, Captain.
- Soldier, want to fill me in?

867
01:14:35,319 --> 01:14:37,022
Uh, yeah.
Lieutenant DeWindt, sir.

868
01:14:37,148 --> 01:14:40,372
99th Troop Carrier Squadron
carrying 327th Glider lnfantry.

869
01:14:40,497 --> 01:14:44,196
This one was mine.
l was the pilot. 22 dead.

870
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:48,429
l ended up without a scratch.
Took my co-pilot's head off.

871
01:14:48,556 --> 01:14:50,355
Well, who are these people?

872
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:54,730
The guys we came with,
they headed off first night.

873
01:14:54,855 --> 01:14:58,847
Other guys keep showing up.
One, two, half-dozen at a time.

874
01:14:58,971 --> 01:15:01,881
Then some officer'll
patch together a mixed unit,

875
01:15:02,007 --> 01:15:04,252
head off to make trouble, sir.

876
01:15:04,376 --> 01:15:06,264
We're looking for
Private James Ryan.

877
01:15:06,388 --> 01:15:08,569
Baker Company, 506 of the 101st.

878
01:15:08,696 --> 01:15:10,078
No, you got me, sir.

879
01:15:10,203 --> 01:15:11,413
A lot of guys
come in and out of here.

880
01:15:12,621 --> 01:15:13,580
Check that squad.

881
01:15:13,706 --> 01:15:17,488
- See if Ryan's in it.
- Yes, sir.

882
01:15:18,779 --> 01:15:23,016
Smell that leg right there.
ls it south of cheese?

883
01:15:29,464 --> 01:15:30,550
What?

884
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:38,543
Keep moving. Keep moving!

885
01:15:40,746 --> 01:15:42,531
l'm Juden, you know?

886
01:15:42,655 --> 01:15:45,032
Ju-den.

887
01:15:45,156 --> 01:15:48,135
Yeah, l couldn't
pry him out of there,

888
01:15:48,261 --> 01:15:50,438
- l'd need a winch.
- Yeah.

889
01:15:54,025 --> 01:15:54,979
Stars.

890
01:15:55,105 --> 01:15:58,181
Yep, Brigadier General Amend,

891
01:15:58,308 --> 01:16:01,067
Deputy Commander, 101st.

892
01:16:01,192 --> 01:16:03,557
Some fucking genius
had the idea

893
01:16:03,682 --> 01:16:05,566
of welding steel plates on

894
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:08,583
to keep the general safe
from ground fire.

895
01:16:08,711 --> 01:16:10,885
Unfortunately,
they forgot to tell me

896
01:16:11,011 --> 01:16:12,803
until we were getting airborne.

897
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,885
That's like flying
a freight train.

898
01:16:15,009 --> 01:16:16,091
OK?

899
01:16:16,217 --> 01:16:17,505
Gross overload.

900
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:20,291
Trim characteristics
all shot to hell.

901
01:16:20,415 --> 01:16:23,386
l nearly broke both my arms
keeping her level.

902
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:25,390
And when...and when we released,

903
01:16:25,518 --> 01:16:29,501
l cut as hard as l could,
tried to gain altitude

904
01:16:29,628 --> 01:16:31,549
and still keep from stalling.

905
01:16:31,673 --> 01:16:33,591
Came down like a fucking meteor.

906
01:16:33,716 --> 01:16:36,502
Here's how we ended up.

907
01:16:36,627 --> 01:16:38,624
And the others,

908
01:16:38,746 --> 01:16:41,241
they stopped easy enough
OK, though, you know?

909
01:16:41,367 --> 01:16:45,278
We were just...we were
just too damn heavy, you know?

910
01:16:45,404 --> 01:16:47,670
The grass was wet.

911
01:16:47,797 --> 01:16:50,102
Downward slope and all.

912
01:16:50,227 --> 01:16:53,019
22 guys dead.

913
01:16:55,267 --> 01:16:57,055
All that for a general?

914
01:16:57,181 --> 01:16:59,260
One man.

915
01:17:01,089 --> 01:17:04,247
- Lot of that going around.
- Fubar.

916
01:17:04,371 --> 01:17:05,669
Fubar.

917
01:17:05,797 --> 01:17:07,138
Fubar.

918
01:17:07,264 --> 01:17:08,566
Fubar.

919
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:10,741
Y'all got that right.

920
01:17:11,993 --> 01:17:15,033
l looked in a German dictionary.
There's no ''fubar'' in there.

921
01:17:15,157 --> 01:17:16,198
- Upham.
- Yes, sir?

922
01:17:16,322 --> 01:17:18,983
There's more paratroops.
Find out if one's Ryan.

923
01:17:19,066 --> 01:17:20,063
Yes, sir.

924
01:17:20,189 --> 01:17:23,136
You might want
to check these out, sir.

925
01:17:23,259 --> 01:17:25,012
Dog tags.

926
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:28,703
More than l really
want to count, sir.

927
01:17:28,831 --> 01:17:31,838
l've...l've covered
a lot of bodies, sir.

928
01:17:31,966 --> 01:17:34,050
Jackson...

929
01:17:34,173 --> 01:17:35,628
start going through those.

930
01:17:35,754 --> 01:17:36,709
Yes, sir.

931
01:17:38,291 --> 01:17:40,120
l'll help.

932
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:44,066
What do you think? He in there?

933
01:17:44,190 --> 01:17:46,370
lf he is, l'll find him.

934
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,255
l bet he is.

935
01:17:48,382 --> 01:17:51,393
10 bucks says l nail him first.

936
01:17:51,521 --> 01:17:55,102
- Who we got...?
- You don't stand a chance.

937
01:17:55,225 --> 01:17:58,677
- You think he's in here?
- Just keep looking.

938
01:17:58,803 --> 01:18:00,964
All right. Gary lanico.

939
01:18:01,088 --> 01:18:02,293
Ben Rubino. Mike Cessacchio.

940
01:18:02,416 --> 01:18:04,622
All the Guineas
are buying it, huh?

941
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:07,076
Oh, come on,
not the right name.

942
01:18:07,203 --> 01:18:09,341
Wee Willie Winkie,
that's your buddy.

943
01:18:09,467 --> 01:18:11,641
We gotta find this prick.

944
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:18,133
Where is this sonofabitch?

945
01:18:18,258 --> 01:18:21,332
Don't mix them up?
Keep them in your pile.

946
01:18:21,457 --> 01:18:23,323
How will l know who's here?

947
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:26,211
Why don't you just shut up,
Reiben, all right?

948
01:18:26,335 --> 01:18:27,636
Everybody be friends.

949
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,313
Cranky there, huh?

950
01:18:30,778 --> 01:18:32,112
l got a winner.

951
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:33,570
What you talking about?

952
01:18:33,696 --> 01:18:35,026
Ryan.

953
01:18:35,153 --> 01:18:36,150
Ryan?

954
01:18:36,275 --> 01:18:38,063
Look at that, Mellish.

955
01:18:38,189 --> 01:18:41,802
You're a genius, you really are.
R-l-E-N-N-E.

956
01:18:41,928 --> 01:18:45,259
That's Rienne. That's French.
You know what that means?

957
01:18:45,384 --> 01:18:46,643
lt means nothing.

958
01:18:46,769 --> 01:18:51,042
- Three of a kind.
- All from New York.

959
01:18:51,167 --> 01:18:52,626
Do you need
a hand with that?

960
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:54,126
l got a full house.

961
01:18:54,252 --> 01:18:56,123
Got you beat. Straight flush.

962
01:18:56,248 --> 01:18:59,616
You were looking at my tags.
You're cheating, you know?

963
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:00,778
Ryan.

964
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:02,479
Fuckin' unreal, this guy.

965
01:19:02,607 --> 01:19:03,977
Do you need a hand with that?

966
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,358
Can you read that shit?

967
01:19:05,482 --> 01:19:07,788
Jesus, look at
this poor bastard.

968
01:19:07,914 --> 01:19:09,549
They're not bulletproof, huh?

969
01:19:09,677 --> 01:19:11,057
Guess not. All right?

970
01:19:11,181 --> 01:19:12,556
What's between his ears?

971
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:16,054
Sort of what you
fellas got between your legs.

972
01:19:16,177 --> 01:19:18,589
We got to give him that.

973
01:19:18,714 --> 01:19:20,513
Not bad, Jackson.

974
01:19:20,642 --> 01:19:25,050
What the hell are you doing?
The whole Airborne's watching.

975
01:19:25,178 --> 01:19:26,267
These aren't chips.

976
01:19:26,392 --> 01:19:29,959
- All right, all right.
- Put 'em back in!

977
01:19:53,957 --> 01:19:55,577
He's not here.

978
01:19:58,366 --> 01:19:59,652
Put 'em back.

979
01:19:59,779 --> 01:20:02,561
Maybe we should split
into groups, huh?

980
01:20:02,686 --> 01:20:05,269
Wander the woods,
calling his name.

981
01:20:05,393 --> 01:20:07,952
He'll hear us
sooner or later. Ryan!

982
01:20:08,079 --> 01:20:11,760
That might be a little hard
to do, Captain.

983
01:20:11,886 --> 01:20:15,052
Maybe the locals... Hey, you
know... uh, excusez-moi.

984
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:17,089
Parlez-vous Ryan, James Ryan?

985
01:20:17,214 --> 01:20:18,753
Merci. Merci beaucoup.

986
01:20:18,878 --> 01:20:20,790
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
101st Airborne?

987
01:20:20,915 --> 01:20:22,990
Ryan? You know a guy named Ryan?

988
01:20:23,115 --> 01:20:24,906
Private James Ryan from lowa?

989
01:20:25,032 --> 01:20:27,755
Anybody know a Ryan?

990
01:20:27,884 --> 01:20:28,889
James Ryan?!

991
01:20:29,015 --> 01:20:32,733
Hey, Joe, doesn't,
uh, Michaelson

992
01:20:32,858 --> 01:20:35,855
pal around with a Ryan
from ''C'' Company?

993
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,020
l think so.

994
01:20:37,145 --> 01:20:39,224
Bring him up here, would you?

995
01:20:48,273 --> 01:20:49,574
You know Private Ryan?

996
01:20:49,699 --> 01:20:51,123
You're gonna have
to speak up, sir.

997
01:20:51,247 --> 01:20:53,788
Speak up, sir!
My hearing's not good!

998
01:20:53,914 --> 01:20:55,122
lt comes and goes!

999
01:20:55,245 --> 01:20:57,324
A grenade went off by me!

1000
01:20:57,449 --> 01:21:01,024
Got it, got it.
Do you know Private Ryan?

1001
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:02,145
Who?

1002
01:21:02,269 --> 01:21:05,896
- Private Ryan? James Ryan?
- Jimmy Ryan?

1003
01:21:06,025 --> 01:21:08,999
James. James Francis Ryan.

1004
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:11,884
No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.

1005
01:21:12,013 --> 01:21:14,969
Get me a pencil,
something to write on.

1006
01:21:15,092 --> 01:21:16,923
Quick! Come on, a pencil!

1007
01:21:19,293 --> 01:21:21,039
A small one, sir.

1008
01:21:21,785 --> 01:21:23,154
Write this down.

1009
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,989
James Francis Ryan,
question mark.

1010
01:21:25,114 --> 01:21:27,380
lowa, question mark.

1011
01:21:27,504 --> 01:21:29,599
Do you know know him?

1012
01:21:29,728 --> 01:21:30,898
Read the message. Look.

1013
01:21:33,605 --> 01:21:35,711
Yeah. Of course
l know him, sir.

1014
01:21:35,837 --> 01:21:37,333
Where is he?

1015
01:21:40,909 --> 01:21:41,865
Yeah, yeah.

1016
01:21:41,987 --> 01:21:44,984
We missed our drop zone
by 20 miles,

1017
01:21:45,111 --> 01:21:48,002
ended up by Bumville
or some damn place.

1018
01:21:48,127 --> 01:21:51,269
We were coming here
to the rally point,

1019
01:21:51,393 --> 01:21:54,602
ran into a colonel
who was gathering up men

1020
01:21:54,728 --> 01:21:57,969
- to go to, uh...Ramelle...
- Ramelle.

1021
01:21:58,097 --> 01:22:00,840
Babysitting a bridge.
That's all l know, sir.

1022
01:22:00,966 --> 01:22:02,584
Great! Great!
Thank...thank you.

1023
01:22:02,708 --> 01:22:04,746
Write ''thank you.''
Read, and thank you.

1024
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:06,085
You're welcome!

1025
01:22:06,214 --> 01:22:07,344
Assemble on me.

1026
01:22:09,609 --> 01:22:11,159
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1027
01:22:14,283 --> 01:22:16,488
Ramelle.

1028
01:22:16,613 --> 01:22:19,854
We're here. There.

1029
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,019
Ramelle...

1030
01:22:21,144 --> 01:22:25,053
is on the Merderet river,
just south-west of us.

1031
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:28,869
You know anything about
this bridge, Captain?

1032
01:22:28,993 --> 01:22:32,338
Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg.

1033
01:22:32,463 --> 01:22:36,127
We can't push on Paris
without a deep water port,

1034
01:22:36,252 --> 01:22:37,791
Rommel knows that,

1035
01:22:37,915 --> 01:22:42,335
so he's gonna try to get
his armour across the river.

1036
01:22:42,462 --> 01:22:47,390
Then he can hit us in the flank
when we turn to Cherbourg.

1037
01:22:47,514 --> 01:22:52,618
That makes any village with a
bridge solid-gold real estate.

1038
01:23:12,964 --> 01:23:14,923
Let's go.

1039
01:23:23,757 --> 01:23:25,511
Captain.

1040
01:24:03,784 --> 01:24:05,414
What the hell is that?

1041
01:24:07,215 --> 01:24:10,400
A radar site.
Must be out of action.

1042
01:24:10,526 --> 01:24:12,612
Looks like there's
something in that...

1043
01:24:12,736 --> 01:24:15,155
sandbag bunker
right under the station.

1044
01:24:16,234 --> 01:24:17,192
See it?

1045
01:24:17,315 --> 01:24:19,145
Yeah. That's my guess, too.

1046
01:24:20,850 --> 01:24:23,175
What is it?

1047
01:24:23,298 --> 01:24:25,553
Machine gun. Probably MG-42.

1048
01:24:25,678 --> 01:24:27,942
Jesus. ls that
what got those guys?

1049
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:30,539
Maybe one of them's our boy.

1050
01:24:30,667 --> 01:24:33,041
No, their patches are 82nd.

1051
01:24:33,169 --> 01:24:35,998
l don't know
how fast you guys are,

1052
01:24:36,126 --> 01:24:39,866
but let's detour this way,
they'll never know we were here.

1053
01:24:41,029 --> 01:24:44,978
So, Captain,
let's just go around it.

1054
01:24:45,106 --> 01:24:48,794
l hear what you're saying,
but we can't.

1055
01:24:48,918 --> 01:24:52,014
l'm with Reiben
on this one, sir.

1056
01:24:52,138 --> 01:24:55,807
- We left them 88s.
- For the Air Force.

1057
01:24:55,929 --> 01:24:59,881
The Air Force won't spend
ordinance on one machine gun.

1058
01:25:00,003 --> 01:25:02,080
Uh, Captain...

1059
01:25:02,204 --> 01:25:05,183
We skip it and still
accomplish our mission.

1060
01:25:05,311 --> 01:25:07,869
l mean, this isn't
our mission, right?

1061
01:25:07,993 --> 01:25:11,511
That's what you want to do,
just leave it here?

1062
01:25:11,634 --> 01:25:13,634
Let them ambush
the next company?

1063
01:25:13,758 --> 01:25:18,170
No, sir, l'm simply saying, it
seems like an unnecessary risk

1064
01:25:18,293 --> 01:25:19,502
given our objective, sir.

1065
01:25:19,626 --> 01:25:21,868
Our objective is to win the war.

1066
01:25:24,861 --> 01:25:29,347
Sir, l just, uh, l don't have
a good feeling about this one.

1067
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:34,524
When was the last time
you felt good about anything?

1068
01:25:56,203 --> 01:25:59,195
All right, three runners
with suppressing fire.

1069
01:25:59,321 --> 01:26:01,232
Mellish, you hook to the right.

1070
01:26:01,358 --> 01:26:03,115
l'll go up the middle.

1071
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:04,989
Who's going left?

1072
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:12,900
Who's going left?

1073
01:26:17,147 --> 01:26:19,184
l'll do it.

1074
01:26:19,309 --> 01:26:20,513
l'll go left.

1075
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:22,218
All right.

1076
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:25,885
Upham, switch off with Jackson,
and you linger in the rear.

1077
01:26:26,009 --> 01:26:27,517
Yes, sir.

1078
01:26:27,644 --> 01:26:31,414
We keep pressure on till
he has to change his barrels.

1079
01:26:31,539 --> 01:26:35,206
l think we should be able
to hit him from grenade range.

1080
01:26:35,330 --> 01:26:39,281
- l should take the middle, sir.
- The way you run?

1081
01:26:39,404 --> 01:26:43,725
- Maybe l should go left, sir.
- Maybe you should shut up.

1082
01:26:43,848 --> 01:26:46,777
Reiben, base of fire.

1083
01:26:54,995 --> 01:26:57,946
Mags and clips where
you can reach 'em, and...

1084
01:26:58,069 --> 01:27:00,732
and extra grenades
for the base runners.

1085
01:28:25,235 --> 01:28:27,496
Hill's clear!
Four down and dead!

1086
01:28:27,623 --> 01:28:30,932
Upham, grab the gear.
Get up here!

1087
01:28:31,059 --> 01:28:33,000
We need water
and extra dressing now!

1088
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:35,084
Get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!

1089
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:38,120
Get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!

1090
01:28:48,873 --> 01:28:50,383
Son of a bitch!

1091
01:28:50,508 --> 01:28:52,346
Get some sulphur on there.

1092
01:28:52,472 --> 01:28:53,598
Move my legs up.

1093
01:28:53,723 --> 01:28:55,474
More sulphur, Mellish.

1094
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:57,842
You're gonna be all right, doc.

1095
01:28:57,969 --> 01:28:59,340
How's it look?

1096
01:28:59,464 --> 01:29:01,584
Wade, you're going
on a hospital ship.

1097
01:29:01,707 --> 01:29:03,035
More sulphur!

1098
01:29:03,161 --> 01:29:05,745
Put my legs up.
Put my legs up.

1099
01:29:05,873 --> 01:29:08,595
l got 'em. l got 'em. l got 'em.

1100
01:29:08,721 --> 01:29:10,522
Upham, give me your canteen!

1101
01:29:10,649 --> 01:29:14,362
Come on. Come on. come on.

1102
01:29:14,486 --> 01:29:15,652
Put some pressure on it.

1103
01:29:15,777 --> 01:29:18,439
- You'll be OK.
- How's it look?

1104
01:29:18,521 --> 01:29:21,307
- Give him morphine.
- How's it look?

1105
01:29:21,431 --> 01:29:24,023
- All right.
- How's it look?

1106
01:29:24,146 --> 01:29:25,566
Here comes the morphine.

1107
01:29:25,692 --> 01:29:29,294
Am l shot in the spine?

1108
01:29:29,421 --> 01:29:31,053
- You're OK, Wade.

1109
01:29:31,178 --> 01:29:32,598
Am l shot in the spine?

1110
01:29:32,724 --> 01:29:34,516
Lift him up. Easy, easy, easy.

1111
01:29:34,642 --> 01:29:36,057
Put some pressure on him.

1112
01:29:36,182 --> 01:29:37,472
Easy, easy.

1113
01:29:37,595 --> 01:29:38,885
Lift him up.

1114
01:29:41,169 --> 01:29:44,119
lt's OK, doc. lt's all right.

1115
01:29:44,243 --> 01:29:46,712
Wade, you got an exit wound.

1116
01:29:46,839 --> 01:29:48,470
lt's in the small of your back.

1117
01:29:48,596 --> 01:29:51,151
How big...how big's
the hole in the...

1118
01:29:51,275 --> 01:29:53,029
lt's about the size of an acorn.

1119
01:29:53,153 --> 01:29:54,281
You're fine.

1120
01:29:56,945 --> 01:29:59,188
Put some pressure on it.

1121
01:29:59,313 --> 01:30:02,636
Put some pressure on it.
Put some pressure on it.

1122
01:30:02,759 --> 01:30:03,840
lt's all right.

1123
01:30:03,964 --> 01:30:06,808
Put some more pressure on it!

1124
01:30:06,936 --> 01:30:09,949
ls there anything bleeding
worse than the others?

1125
01:30:10,075 --> 01:30:11,916
Yeah, right here.
Do you know what it is?

1126
01:30:12,042 --> 01:30:13,207
No.

1127
01:30:13,333 --> 01:30:15,671
Here. l'll put your hand on it.

1128
01:30:15,794 --> 01:30:17,689
Pressure on there.

1129
01:30:17,812 --> 01:30:19,726
Right there. OK? That's the one.

1130
01:30:19,849 --> 01:30:23,960
Oh, my God, my liver!
Oh, my God! lt's my liver!

1131
01:30:24,083 --> 01:30:27,430
Tell us what to do.
Tell us how to fix you.

1132
01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:30,280
What can we do?
Tell us what to do.

1133
01:30:30,410 --> 01:30:32,078
Oh, shit.

1134
01:30:32,201 --> 01:30:36,580
l could use...l could use
a little more morphine.

1135
01:30:37,789 --> 01:30:39,907
More morphine, sir?

1136
01:30:46,270 --> 01:30:47,911
Give it to him.

1137
01:30:49,922 --> 01:30:51,258
Give it to him.

1138
01:30:56,014 --> 01:30:57,006
l don't wanna die.

1139
01:30:57,131 --> 01:31:00,581
Here you go, Wade. Here you go.

1140
01:31:00,710 --> 01:31:02,204
There you go. There you...

1141
01:31:05,154 --> 01:31:07,459
Give him another one.

1142
01:31:14,691 --> 01:31:16,147
Mama?

1143
01:31:18,438 --> 01:31:20,598
Mama?

1144
01:31:20,722 --> 01:31:24,418
l want to go home.
l want to go home.

1145
01:31:24,546 --> 01:31:28,102
Mama! Mama! Mam...

1146
01:32:14,214 --> 01:32:15,297
Reiben, hold him!

1147
01:32:36,351 --> 01:32:37,639
Not yet.

1148
01:32:39,469 --> 01:32:43,431
First, make him mark and cover
Wade's body for grave detail.

1149
01:32:45,096 --> 01:32:48,447
Same thing for
those paratroopers down there.

1150
01:32:48,572 --> 01:32:50,625
Strip that stuff.
Check for intelligence.

1151
01:32:50,752 --> 01:32:53,880
Ask if he's the one
who shot Wade.

1152
01:32:54,007 --> 01:32:56,839
- lt doesn't matter.
- lt does matter!

1153
01:33:00,539 --> 01:33:03,196
Shut up with that
filthy Pig Latin.

1154
01:33:05,027 --> 01:33:06,283
Jackson, you're hit.

1155
01:33:09,298 --> 01:33:11,014
Shut up.

1156
01:33:11,141 --> 01:33:14,228
- lt just skinned me, sir.
- Get it dressed.

1157
01:33:14,354 --> 01:33:16,936
You and Sarge
watch the perimeter.

1158
01:33:20,012 --> 01:33:21,756
He says please don't shoot.

1159
01:33:21,879 --> 01:33:23,831
l don't care, Upham.

1160
01:33:25,416 --> 01:33:28,432
Sir? Sir, you're gonna
let them kill him?

1161
01:33:28,559 --> 01:33:33,700
- This is not right, sir.
- Help him with the bodies.

1162
01:33:36,075 --> 01:33:38,112
What is happening?

1163
01:35:28,369 --> 01:35:30,400
American.

1164
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:33,828
l like American.

1165
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:43,267
Steamboat Willie.

1166
01:35:43,391 --> 01:35:45,143
Steamboat Willie.

1167
01:35:45,266 --> 01:35:48,031
Yeah, Steamboat Willie.
American.

1168
01:35:58,589 --> 01:36:00,374
He's says he's not finished.

1169
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:01,912
That's what you think.

1170
01:36:13,121 --> 01:36:14,413
Please...

1171
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:17,909
l like America.

1172
01:36:18,035 --> 01:36:20,280
Fancy schmancy! What a cinch!

1173
01:36:20,404 --> 01:36:23,934
Go fly a kite! Cat got
your tongue! Cool beans!

1174
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:30,628
Betty Boop! What a dish!

1175
01:36:30,753 --> 01:36:32,885
Betty Grable. Nice gams.

1176
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:42,454
l say can you see...

1177
01:36:42,867 --> 01:36:46,203
l say can you see...

1178
01:36:46,329 --> 01:36:48,127
l...l say...

1179
01:36:54,692 --> 01:36:56,732
Fuck Hitler.

1180
01:36:58,811 --> 01:37:00,806
Fuck Hitler.

1181
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:10,822
Sir, he says
he's sorry about Wade.

1182
01:37:10,947 --> 01:37:13,722
He says he's sorry
about Wade, sir.

1183
01:37:13,849 --> 01:37:15,813
Captain!

1184
01:37:15,938 --> 01:37:18,058
Captain, this isn't right!

1185
01:37:18,182 --> 01:37:20,386
You know this. He's a prisoner.

1186
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:22,006
He surrendered.

1187
01:37:22,129 --> 01:37:24,123
He surrendered, sir!

1188
01:37:34,701 --> 01:37:36,574
Tell him...

1189
01:37:39,027 --> 01:37:43,015
To march a thousand paces, then
he can take off the blindfold.

1190
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:46,896
We'll be gone, and he turns
himself in to Allied patrols.

1191
01:37:47,021 --> 01:37:50,202
- We're letting him go?
- He's a POW, Reiben.

1192
01:37:50,328 --> 01:37:52,084
Can't take him with us.

1193
01:37:52,208 --> 01:37:54,548
Our guys'll pick him up.

1194
01:38:05,194 --> 01:38:07,871
lf he isn't picked up
by the Wehrmacht,

1195
01:38:07,999 --> 01:38:09,922
then thrown back
into circulation.

1196
01:38:12,307 --> 01:38:14,644
Captain, you just
let the enemy go.

1197
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:16,395
This is such bullshit.

1198
01:38:16,519 --> 01:38:17,808
Y'all got that right.

1199
01:38:17,933 --> 01:38:20,469
Bullshit? This is bullshit?

1200
01:38:20,594 --> 01:38:23,709
Shooting prisoners is OK?
lt's against the goddamn rules!

1201
01:38:23,832 --> 01:38:26,797
The rules just walked
off with your friend.

1202
01:38:28,304 --> 01:38:31,692
But l guess that was
the decent thing to do,

1203
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:32,780
huh, Captain?

1204
01:38:40,399 --> 01:38:42,891
Get your gear. Let's go.

1205
01:38:45,263 --> 01:38:47,481
You heard him. Gear up.

1206
01:38:47,604 --> 01:38:49,699
The Captain
just gave you an order.

1207
01:38:49,826 --> 01:38:53,087
Yeah. Like the one
to take this machine gun.

1208
01:38:53,210 --> 01:38:55,465
That was a real doozie, sarge.

1209
01:38:55,589 --> 01:38:57,047
Soldier, you're outta line.

1210
01:38:57,174 --> 01:39:00,644
Yes, sir, one hell of a call,
to take this nest.

1211
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:04,048
But, what the hell,
we only lost one guy.

1212
01:39:04,175 --> 01:39:07,726
l hope mama Ryan's happy
knowing that little Jimmy's life

1213
01:39:07,852 --> 01:39:09,904
is more important than our guys!

1214
01:39:10,029 --> 01:39:13,040
But then, we haven't
found him yet, have we?

1215
01:39:14,541 --> 01:39:16,167
Get the hell off me!

1216
01:39:16,292 --> 01:39:17,623
Reiben, get up.

1217
01:39:20,035 --> 01:39:22,690
Gear up. Fall in.

1218
01:39:28,258 --> 01:39:30,144
l'm done with this mission.

1219
01:39:38,442 --> 01:39:39,399
Sir.

1220
01:39:39,523 --> 01:39:43,427
Don't walk away from your
Captain, get back in line.

1221
01:39:43,551 --> 01:39:46,306
l'll go to the stockade
if l have to.

1222
01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:48,733
- l won't ask again.
- Captain!

1223
01:39:48,857 --> 01:39:50,115
This is bullshit!

1224
01:39:50,241 --> 01:39:51,203
Fall in!

1225
01:39:51,328 --> 01:39:54,792
- You'd shoot me over Ryan?
- No, l don't like you.

1226
01:39:54,918 --> 01:39:56,792
Just let him go!

1227
01:39:56,917 --> 01:39:58,705
Are you letting this happen?

1228
01:39:58,830 --> 01:40:00,617
Captain! You see this?

1229
01:40:00,743 --> 01:40:04,482
- Captain? Sir? Ryan's dead.
- Bullshit!

1230
01:40:04,607 --> 01:40:08,955
- Sir, we have a situation.
- l have a sixth sense, l know.

1231
01:40:09,081 --> 01:40:12,135
You don't kill Krauts,
but you shoot me, huh?

1232
01:40:12,261 --> 01:40:16,598
- He's better than you.
- Do it. Put one in my leg...

1233
01:40:16,723 --> 01:40:18,927
l'm gonna shoot you
in your big goddamn mouth!

1234
01:40:19,052 --> 01:40:20,797
Put your money where your...

1235
01:40:20,922 --> 01:40:23,620
You don't know when to shut up.

1236
01:40:23,745 --> 01:40:24,745
Captain, please!

1237
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:27,212
What's the pool on me up to?

1238
01:40:27,339 --> 01:40:28,426
What?

1239
01:40:28,551 --> 01:40:31,728
- You coward son of a bitch!
- l'm waiting, sarge.

1240
01:40:31,855 --> 01:40:35,239
Mike, what's the pool
on me up to now?

1241
01:40:35,365 --> 01:40:37,735
What...what's it up to?

1242
01:40:37,858 --> 01:40:40,315
What is it, $300?
ls that it, 300?

1243
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:42,452
l'm a schoolteacher.

1244
01:40:46,455 --> 01:40:49,428
l teach English composition

1245
01:40:49,552 --> 01:40:52,057
in this little town called
Addley, Pennsylvania.

1246
01:40:52,183 --> 01:40:54,857
The last 1 1 years,

1247
01:40:54,981 --> 01:40:57,442
l've been at
Thomas Alva Edison High School.

1248
01:40:59,850 --> 01:41:02,799
l was the coach
of the baseball team.

1249
01:41:05,632 --> 01:41:08,181
l'll be doggone.

1250
01:41:08,308 --> 01:41:11,864
Back home, when l'd tell people
what l do for a living,

1251
01:41:11,988 --> 01:41:15,748
they'd think,
''Well, that figures.''

1252
01:41:15,872 --> 01:41:19,659
But over here, it's a...

1253
01:41:19,781 --> 01:41:23,225
a big...

1254
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:25,017
a big mystery.

1255
01:41:25,141 --> 01:41:30,245
So l guess l've changed some.

1256
01:41:30,369 --> 01:41:34,049
Sometimes l wonder
if l've changed so much,

1257
01:41:34,173 --> 01:41:38,760
my wife will even recognise me
whenever l get back to her.

1258
01:41:40,249 --> 01:41:45,445
And how l'll ever be able to...

1259
01:41:45,574 --> 01:41:48,249
to tell her
about days like today.

1260
01:41:50,892 --> 01:41:54,312
Ah, Ryan...

1261
01:41:54,436 --> 01:41:57,775
l don't know anything
about Ryan. l don't care.

1262
01:41:57,902 --> 01:42:03,624
The man means nothing to me,
just a name. But if...

1263
01:42:03,752 --> 01:42:06,933
lf finding him
so he can go home,

1264
01:42:07,056 --> 01:42:09,602
lets me get back to my wife,

1265
01:42:09,726 --> 01:42:13,866
well, then...
then that's my mission.

1266
01:42:15,576 --> 01:42:17,411
You want to leave?

1267
01:42:17,534 --> 01:42:21,402
You want to go off
and fight the war?

1268
01:42:23,192 --> 01:42:25,646
All right.

1269
01:42:25,772 --> 01:42:28,762
All right, l won't stop you.

1270
01:42:28,885 --> 01:42:31,104
l'll even put in the paperwork.

1271
01:42:32,694 --> 01:42:37,656
l just know, every man l kill,
the farther from home l feel.

1272
01:44:02,835 --> 01:44:06,002
By memories

1273
01:44:06,129 --> 01:44:09,896
Of days gone by

1274
01:44:10,024 --> 01:44:12,633
ln my solitude

1275
01:44:12,758 --> 01:44:14,972
You taunt me

1276
01:44:15,098 --> 01:44:16,267
With memories

1277
01:44:16,392 --> 01:44:19,717
That never die

1278
01:44:19,841 --> 01:44:22,500
l sit in my chair

1279
01:44:22,584 --> 01:44:24,747
Filled with despair

1280
01:44:24,871 --> 01:44:26,667
There's no one

1281
01:44:26,792 --> 01:44:30,181
Could be so sad

1282
01:44:30,307 --> 01:44:32,104
With gloom everywhere

1283
01:44:32,230 --> 01:44:34,402
l sit and l stare...

1284
01:44:48,187 --> 01:44:49,945
Half-track! Cover!

1285
01:45:06,150 --> 01:45:10,125
Who's doing the shooting?
Who's doing the shooting?

1286
01:45:30,014 --> 01:45:31,854
Move on their left flank!

1287
01:45:31,976 --> 01:45:33,189
Take their left flank!

1288
01:45:33,313 --> 01:45:35,988
Hold on, make sure they're down!

1289
01:45:57,064 --> 01:46:00,183
101st! We're coming out!

1290
01:46:06,942 --> 01:46:09,788
That was a recon element,
second SS.

1291
01:46:09,912 --> 01:46:14,092
We've been expecting a probe.
That must have been it.

1292
01:46:16,972 --> 01:46:20,253
Captain Miller,
Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers.

1293
01:46:20,381 --> 01:46:22,330
Corporal Henderson,
Easy Company, Five-o-first.

1294
01:46:22,456 --> 01:46:24,075
Ryan, First
of the Five-o-sixth.

1295
01:46:24,201 --> 01:46:26,454
PFC Toynbe,
Third of the Five-o-sixth.

1296
01:46:26,577 --> 01:46:28,627
James Francis Ryan?

1297
01:46:28,756 --> 01:46:31,472
Yes, sir. How'd you guess that?

1298
01:46:43,008 --> 01:46:46,217
Looks like you guys
got hit pretty hard.

1299
01:46:46,342 --> 01:46:49,898
Yes, sir. Small unit action.

1300
01:46:52,027 --> 01:46:55,288
They beat the hell
out of us with 88s.

1301
01:47:01,318 --> 01:47:05,731
Sir, if you're our relief,
l'm gonna file a complaint.

1302
01:47:05,855 --> 01:47:07,651
l wouldn't blame you.

1303
01:47:07,779 --> 01:47:10,748
Who's your CO?

1304
01:47:10,873 --> 01:47:13,714
lt would have been
Captain Jennings, sir.

1305
01:47:13,839 --> 01:47:17,096
The best we can muster now
is a corporal.

1306
01:47:18,259 --> 01:47:20,751
So, what are you guys
all about?

1307
01:47:21,832 --> 01:47:25,368
We're here for him. Ryan.

1308
01:47:25,494 --> 01:47:26,997
Me, sir?

1309
01:47:36,525 --> 01:47:40,083
James Francis Ryan of lowa?

1310
01:47:40,208 --> 01:47:42,781
Yes, sir.
Payton, lowa, that's correct.

1311
01:47:42,907 --> 01:47:45,447
What is this about?

1312
01:47:47,369 --> 01:47:50,213
Your brothers
were killed in combat.

1313
01:47:56,936 --> 01:47:59,141
Which...which ones?

1314
01:48:01,259 --> 01:48:03,046
All of them.

1315
01:48:09,305 --> 01:48:14,656
Uh...On...on the level?

1316
01:48:15,782 --> 01:48:17,658
Yeah. l'm afraid so.

1317
01:48:17,781 --> 01:48:22,186
Uh...You might want
to take some time with this.

1318
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:25,267
lf there's someplace
you want to go and...

1319
01:48:34,504 --> 01:48:38,003
- What's this all about?
- Ryan lost his brothers.

1320
01:48:38,131 --> 01:48:40,788
- Which one?
- All of them.

1321
01:48:45,153 --> 01:48:46,530
You...

1322
01:48:48,079 --> 01:48:51,884
You came all the way
out here to tell me that?

1323
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:55,893
Well, you're...
you're going home.

1324
01:48:57,644 --> 01:49:00,304
Our orders are
to bring you back.

1325
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:05,167
Bring me back?

1326
01:49:07,299 --> 01:49:11,521
Corporal Henderson...l don't
mean to leave you short-handed,

1327
01:49:11,645 --> 01:49:13,861
but orders are orders.

1328
01:49:13,986 --> 01:49:15,658
When are you being relieved?

1329
01:49:15,783 --> 01:49:18,282
Sir, we have no way to tell.

1330
01:49:18,405 --> 01:49:21,689
My orders don't include me
abandoning my post.

1331
01:49:21,813 --> 01:49:24,745
l understand that,
but this changes things.

1332
01:49:24,873 --> 01:49:27,183
l don't see that it does, sir.

1333
01:49:28,771 --> 01:49:32,660
The Chief of Staff for the
United States Army says it does.

1334
01:49:32,784 --> 01:49:35,001
Sir, we have
to hold this bridge.

1335
01:49:35,127 --> 01:49:38,873
The 82nd have taken out
every bridge across the Merderet

1336
01:49:38,998 --> 01:49:41,243
except two,
at Valognes and here.

1337
01:49:41,366 --> 01:49:44,693
lf the Germans take 'em,
we'll have to displace.

1338
01:49:44,818 --> 01:49:49,120
Private, your outfit stays,
but your party's over here.

1339
01:49:49,247 --> 01:49:51,462
Sir, l can't leave
until reinforcements...

1340
01:49:51,588 --> 01:49:53,844
You got three minutes.

1341
01:49:53,968 --> 01:49:55,891
Sir, what about them?
There's barely...

1342
01:49:56,017 --> 01:49:57,848
Hey, asshole!

1343
01:49:57,972 --> 01:50:02,460
Two of our guys already died
trying to find you, all right?

1344
01:50:06,835 --> 01:50:08,716
Sir?

1345
01:50:08,842 --> 01:50:10,098
That's right.

1346
01:50:19,525 --> 01:50:21,435
What were their names?

1347
01:50:21,561 --> 01:50:24,220
lrwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

1348
01:50:25,930 --> 01:50:27,933
Wade and...

1349
01:50:29,483 --> 01:50:30,988
Caparzo.

1350
01:50:43,527 --> 01:50:46,069
lt doesn't make any sense.

1351
01:50:47,406 --> 01:50:51,628
lt doesn't make sense, sir.
Why do l deserve to go?

1352
01:50:51,754 --> 01:50:55,014
Why not these guys?
They fought just as hard!

1353
01:50:59,678 --> 01:51:02,833
ls that what they're
supposed to tell your mother

1354
01:51:02,958 --> 01:51:06,332
when they send her another
folded American flag?

1355
01:51:13,128 --> 01:51:15,802
Tell her that when you found me,

1356
01:51:15,887 --> 01:51:19,506
l was here with the only
brothers l have left,

1357
01:51:19,630 --> 01:51:23,742
and that there's no way
l was gonna desert them.

1358
01:51:23,868 --> 01:51:26,538
l think she'll understand that.

1359
01:51:26,619 --> 01:51:28,752
There's no way
l'm leaving this bridge.

1360
01:52:12,081 --> 01:52:13,667
What are your orders?

1361
01:52:15,758 --> 01:52:19,795
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

1362
01:52:19,921 --> 01:52:23,200
The world has taken
a turn for the surreal.

1363
01:52:23,326 --> 01:52:25,867
Clearly, but the question
still stands.

1364
01:52:25,994 --> 01:52:30,005
l don't know. What do you think?

1365
01:52:30,134 --> 01:52:33,181
You don't want to know
what l think.

1366
01:52:35,229 --> 01:52:37,231
No, Mike, l do.

1367
01:52:39,103 --> 01:52:42,344
Well... part of me
thinks the kid's right.

1368
01:52:42,467 --> 01:52:44,671
What's he done to deserve this?

1369
01:52:44,801 --> 01:52:49,158
lf he wants to stay here,
fine, let's leave him.

1370
01:52:50,331 --> 01:52:51,679
Yeah.

1371
01:52:51,805 --> 01:52:54,027
But another part
of me thinks...

1372
01:52:54,150 --> 01:52:57,284
what if by some miracle we stay

1373
01:52:57,408 --> 01:53:00,324
and actually make it
out of here?

1374
01:53:00,447 --> 01:53:02,726
Someday we might look
back and decide

1375
01:53:02,850 --> 01:53:07,271
that saving Private Ryan
was the one decent thing

1376
01:53:07,394 --> 01:53:14,124
we were able to pull out of this
whole God-awful, shitty mess.

1377
01:53:14,249 --> 01:53:18,378
That's what l was thinking, sir.

1378
01:53:18,506 --> 01:53:21,164
Like you said, Captain,

1379
01:53:22,366 --> 01:53:26,702
if we do that...we all earn
the right to go home.

1380
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:32,218
Oh, brother.

1381
01:53:34,893 --> 01:53:38,270
This is everything.

1382
01:53:38,394 --> 01:53:40,595
Two .30-calibre machine guns,

1383
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:42,300
17 grenades,

1384
01:53:42,424 --> 01:53:44,710
1 1 Hawkins mines.

1385
01:53:44,836 --> 01:53:48,134
You got two bazookas,
but only eight rounds left,

1386
01:53:48,259 --> 01:53:50,099
and assorted small arms.

1387
01:53:50,224 --> 01:53:53,025
An arty round took out
our .60 mortar.

1388
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:56,661
Might as well be spit wads
if they use tanks.

1389
01:53:56,785 --> 01:54:00,235
- Which they're sure to.
- What you thinking, sir?

1390
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:01,482
Well...

1391
01:54:01,605 --> 01:54:05,601
l think they're going to try
to whip around the flanks...

1392
01:54:09,278 --> 01:54:12,830
Unless we draw them up
here between these buildings,

1393
01:54:12,954 --> 01:54:16,422
where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck.

1394
01:54:16,548 --> 01:54:18,711
- Disable him?
- lf we can.

1395
01:54:18,837 --> 01:54:22,286
Make the tank a 60-ton
roadblock, we'll have a chance.

1396
01:54:22,410 --> 01:54:24,991
Yes, sir,
don't let them mass anywhere.

1397
01:54:25,116 --> 01:54:27,953
Hit hard and fall back
to the bridge.

1398
01:54:28,079 --> 01:54:32,509
Machine gun moving, number two
up high to piss on their heads.

1399
01:54:32,634 --> 01:54:35,099
That would be the idea.

1400
01:54:35,226 --> 01:54:37,377
Jackson?

1401
01:54:37,501 --> 01:54:39,621
lf we can, l'd like to get
you up in that bell tower.

1402
01:54:39,747 --> 01:54:42,902
- Yes, sir.
- Give you company if need be.

1403
01:54:43,026 --> 01:54:44,901
Yes, sir. Company couldn't hurt.

1404
01:54:45,026 --> 01:54:49,203
l'd say a .30 with about
1 ,000 rounds would be OK.

1405
01:54:49,327 --> 01:54:51,083
Parker, job opportunity.

1406
01:54:51,208 --> 01:54:53,296
Not the worst idea, Captain.

1407
01:54:53,422 --> 01:54:57,182
But it all depends on knocking
out the tank here, right?

1408
01:54:57,308 --> 01:55:00,176
So how do you
plan on doing that?

1409
01:55:00,302 --> 01:55:01,755
Reiben's right.

1410
01:55:01,878 --> 01:55:04,831
As our esteemed colleague
from the Airborne pointed out,

1411
01:55:04,957 --> 01:55:10,012
what we got here is spit wads,
so how do we stop the tank?

1412
01:55:10,137 --> 01:55:11,807
Give it a rabbit to chase.

1413
01:55:11,932 --> 01:55:15,484
We could hit the tank
in the tracks.

1414
01:55:15,609 --> 01:55:17,447
Yeah, but with what?

1415
01:55:19,857 --> 01:55:22,100
We could try a sticky bomb.

1416
01:55:22,225 --> 01:55:23,720
Sticky bomb, sir?

1417
01:55:24,888 --> 01:55:29,856
- Sir, are you making that up?
- No. lt's in the field manual.

1418
01:55:29,984 --> 01:55:32,697
Well, we're out
of field manuals, sir.

1419
01:55:32,823 --> 01:55:34,829
Perhaps you can enlighten us?

1420
01:55:34,954 --> 01:55:38,415
Right, you have demolition -
some TNT or composition B?

1421
01:55:38,542 --> 01:55:42,487
l got that bridge wired
with enough to blow it twice.

1422
01:55:42,612 --> 01:55:44,401
You can spare some, then.

1423
01:55:44,526 --> 01:55:47,990
You take
a standard-issue Gl sock,

1424
01:55:48,114 --> 01:55:51,417
cram it with as much
Comp' B as possible,

1425
01:55:51,542 --> 01:55:53,757
rig up a simple fuse,

1426
01:55:53,879 --> 01:55:56,766
then coat the whole
thing with axle grease.

1427
01:55:56,890 --> 01:55:59,428
When you throw it,
it should stick.

1428
01:55:59,552 --> 01:56:02,293
lt's a bomb that sticks.
A sticky bomb.

1429
01:56:02,419 --> 01:56:07,475
You know a better way to knock
the tracks off a tank, tell me.

1430
01:56:07,602 --> 01:56:11,488
This is good. Now we got
to surrender our socks.

1431
01:56:25,426 --> 01:56:27,011
Haul away.

1432
01:56:40,657 --> 01:56:44,690
Select the field of fire.
Cross with the bell tower.

1433
01:56:44,813 --> 01:56:47,193
l can cover 12 to nine here.

1434
01:56:51,496 --> 01:56:54,043
- Easy!
- l got her!

1435
01:57:27,846 --> 01:57:29,352
Here are the mines.

1436
01:57:40,326 --> 01:57:43,107
For being the best we can do,

1437
01:57:43,231 --> 01:57:47,358
that forward machine gun is not
in a terrible firing position.

1438
01:57:49,826 --> 01:57:51,789
And this position right here...

1439
01:57:54,463 --> 01:57:56,553
this is the Alamo.

1440
01:57:56,677 --> 01:58:00,422
They push us back here,
last man blows the bridge.

1441
01:58:00,546 --> 01:58:03,037
We only got a 30-second fuse,

1442
01:58:03,161 --> 01:58:07,562
so that last man better hurry,
or he won't be alive long.

1443
01:58:08,732 --> 01:58:10,364
Captain?

1444
01:58:10,490 --> 01:58:12,868
Where am l during all this?

1445
01:58:12,996 --> 01:58:17,049
Never more than two feet from
me, and that's not negotiable.

1446
01:58:18,466 --> 01:58:20,666
l'll get some ammo. Come on.

1447
01:58:23,697 --> 01:58:24,905
- Upham.
- Yes.

1448
01:58:25,035 --> 01:58:27,077
- Listen, all right?
- Yeah.

1449
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:28,664
- Listening?
- Yes.

1450
01:58:28,788 --> 01:58:33,257
All right, we'll be displacing
and falling back like crazy...

1451
01:58:33,382 --> 01:58:37,394
So be Johnny-on-the-spot
with ammo or we're dead.

1452
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:39,350
- Right.
- Understand?

1453
01:58:39,473 --> 01:58:42,422
- Johnny-on-the-spot.
- You all right?

1454
01:58:42,547 --> 01:58:43,836
Yeah.

1455
01:58:44,961 --> 01:58:47,131
When we shipped out of England,

1456
01:58:47,258 --> 01:58:50,473
l told the supply sergeant
handing out cigarettes,

1457
01:58:50,599 --> 01:58:52,143
''l don't smoke.''

1458
01:58:52,272 --> 01:58:54,233
''l don't smoke.''

1459
01:58:55,866 --> 01:58:58,033
Quite a situation, huh?

1460
01:58:58,157 --> 01:59:00,194
Unbelievable.

1461
01:59:00,318 --> 01:59:01,232
Here.

1462
01:59:01,358 --> 01:59:05,767
Fucked up beyond
all recognition, right?

1463
01:59:05,893 --> 01:59:07,810
Yeah, you got that right.

1464
01:59:10,486 --> 01:59:11,699
Fubar.

1465
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:17,297
- Yeah, well...
- Fubar.

1466
01:59:17,422 --> 01:59:19,999
lt'll be a real show, huh?

1467
01:59:27,632 --> 01:59:29,390
Take it easy.

1468
01:59:30,684 --> 01:59:32,062
Fubar.

1469
02:00:10,025 --> 02:00:11,654
Who's that singing, sir?

1470
02:00:13,323 --> 02:00:14,703
Edith Piaf.

1471
02:00:16,796 --> 02:00:19,126
What's she so upset about?

1472
02:00:20,247 --> 02:00:21,618
Her lover left her,

1473
02:00:21,743 --> 02:00:25,237
but she still sees his face
everywhere she goes.

1474
02:00:26,654 --> 02:00:28,449
That would do it.

1475
02:00:57,656 --> 02:00:58,903
''Even life itself

1476
02:00:59,028 --> 02:01:00,564
''only represents you.

1477
02:01:03,722 --> 02:01:06,517
''Sometimes l dream
that l'm in your arms.''

1478
02:01:06,639 --> 02:01:10,109
What was that part?
She sang that before.

1479
02:01:10,232 --> 02:01:11,860
The chorus.

1480
02:01:11,987 --> 02:01:14,954
''And you speak softly
in my ear...

1481
02:01:16,792 --> 02:01:18,960
''and you say things

1482
02:01:19,083 --> 02:01:21,201
''that make my eyes close,

1483
02:01:23,903 --> 02:01:25,945
''and l find that marvellous.''

1484
02:01:26,070 --> 02:01:29,202
Uh, again...Upham, uh...

1485
02:01:29,326 --> 02:01:33,142
to be honest, l...l find myself
curiously aroused by you.

1486
02:01:34,865 --> 02:01:38,289
Marvellous. No, it's...
it's a melancholy song.

1487
02:01:38,413 --> 02:01:42,319
At the beginning, she says,
''And then one day, you left.

1488
02:01:42,442 --> 02:01:46,191
''You left me, and, uh...
l've been desperate ever since.

1489
02:01:46,317 --> 02:01:49,615
''l see you all over the sky,
l see you all over the earth.''

1490
02:01:49,739 --> 02:01:53,874
Any more of this, the Krauts
won't have to shoot me.

1491
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,256
l'll just slit my own wrists.

1492
02:01:56,385 --> 02:01:58,759
You're a strange bird, Upham.

1493
02:01:58,885 --> 02:02:00,796
Sorry, it's Edith, you know.

1494
02:02:00,921 --> 02:02:03,744
You know what
that song reminds me of?

1495
02:02:03,869 --> 02:02:07,291
What Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
said when l left for Basic.

1496
02:02:07,414 --> 02:02:09,837
What, ''Don't touch me''?

1497
02:02:09,962 --> 02:02:12,677
No. Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
is our super's wife.

1498
02:02:12,801 --> 02:02:18,234
She tries things on in my mom's
shop, and she's, like, a 44-EE.

1499
02:02:18,357 --> 02:02:21,016
- Double-E?
- These things are massive.

1500
02:02:21,142 --> 02:02:22,264
Those are big.

1501
02:02:22,387 --> 02:02:25,928
l've got her convinced
that she's, like, a 42-D.

1502
02:02:26,052 --> 02:02:29,267
So she's trying to squeeze
into this side-cut,

1503
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:31,061
silk-ribboned,
triple-panel girdle

1504
02:02:31,189 --> 02:02:32,899
with the shelf-lift brassiere.

1505
02:02:33,023 --> 02:02:36,160
And it's beautiful,
she's just pouring out of it.

1506
02:02:36,284 --> 02:02:38,287
lt's beautiful, and she can tell

1507
02:02:38,412 --> 02:02:42,482
l got a hard-on the size
of the Statue of Liberty.

1508
02:02:42,609 --> 02:02:44,607
And she says,
''Richard, calm down.''

1509
02:02:44,731 --> 02:02:47,150
And says,
''When you're over there,

1510
02:02:47,274 --> 02:02:50,173
''if you see anything
that upsets you,

1511
02:02:50,299 --> 02:02:54,976
''just close your eyes and think
of these. You understand?''

1512
02:02:56,858 --> 02:02:58,816
So l said, ''Yes, ma'am.''

1513
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:14,154
Are you all right, sir?

1514
02:03:14,279 --> 02:03:16,495
Yeah, just keeping the rhythm.

1515
02:03:22,715 --> 02:03:26,633
ls it true you were
a teacher back home?

1516
02:03:26,757 --> 02:03:28,133
Yes.

1517
02:03:28,261 --> 02:03:30,641
See, that's something
l could never do

1518
02:03:30,767 --> 02:03:35,152
Not after the way we treated
our teachers. No, sir.

1519
02:03:37,827 --> 02:03:40,737
l had a thousand kids like you.

1520
02:03:46,354 --> 02:03:48,692
l can't see my brothers' faces.

1521
02:03:49,903 --> 02:03:53,036
l've been trying,
and l can't see them.

1522
02:03:53,161 --> 02:03:55,332
Has that ever happened to you?

1523
02:03:55,460 --> 02:03:58,381
You gotta think of a context.

1524
02:03:59,920 --> 02:04:02,036
What does that mean?

1525
02:04:02,163 --> 02:04:05,992
Well, you think about
something specific...

1526
02:04:06,118 --> 02:04:07,661
something you've done together.

1527
02:04:11,631 --> 02:04:15,136
When l think of home,
l think of something specific.

1528
02:04:15,265 --> 02:04:19,060
l think of my hammock
in the backyard or...

1529
02:04:19,184 --> 02:04:24,340
my wife pruning the rose bushes
in a pair of my old work gloves.

1530
02:04:27,925 --> 02:04:31,308
Well, this one night,
two of my brothers came

1531
02:04:31,433 --> 02:04:35,108
and woke me up in
the middle of the night,

1532
02:04:35,235 --> 02:04:38,534
and they said they had
a surprise for me.

1533
02:04:38,659 --> 02:04:42,274
They took me to the barn,
into the loft, and...

1534
02:04:42,397 --> 02:04:44,560
there was
my oldest brother Dan...

1535
02:04:46,187 --> 02:04:49,527
with Alice...Alice Jardine.

1536
02:04:51,863 --> 02:04:56,419
l mean...picture a girl who took
a nosedive from the ugly tree

1537
02:04:56,545 --> 02:04:58,839
and hit every branch
coming down.

1538
02:05:01,088 --> 02:05:03,764
And...and Dan's
got her shirt off.

1539
02:05:03,848 --> 02:05:06,807
So he's working on this bra,

1540
02:05:06,931 --> 02:05:10,524
and all of a sudden,
Sean just screams out...

1541
02:05:10,647 --> 02:05:13,655
''Danny, you're a young man!
Don't do it!''

1542
02:05:16,370 --> 02:05:18,792
And Alice Jardine screams,
and jumps up,

1543
02:05:18,917 --> 02:05:23,947
and tries to get out,
but this shirt's over her head,

1544
02:05:24,069 --> 02:05:27,613
and she runs into the wall
and knocks herself out.

1545
02:05:27,740 --> 02:05:31,624
So now Dan is so mad,
he starts coming after us,

1546
02:05:31,749 --> 02:05:35,675
but Alice is there unconscious,
he's gotta wake her up.

1547
02:05:35,802 --> 02:05:38,972
So he grabs her leg,
and he's dragging her.

1548
02:05:39,096 --> 02:05:42,584
And he picks up a shovel
and goes after Sean.

1549
02:05:42,710 --> 02:05:47,879
Sean says, ''Why are you trying
to hit me? l did you a favour.''

1550
02:05:48,003 --> 02:05:52,388
And this makes Dan more angry.
He tries to swing this thing.

1551
02:05:52,514 --> 02:05:56,651
lt goes out of his grasp
and hits a kerosene lantern.

1552
02:05:56,775 --> 02:06:00,606
The thing explodes, and
the whole barn almost goes up.

1553
02:06:16,220 --> 02:06:19,722
That was it...Dan went
to Basic next day.

1554
02:06:19,847 --> 02:06:23,752
That was the last night
the four of us were together.

1555
02:06:23,878 --> 02:06:25,878
That was two years ago.

1556
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:34,479
Tell me about your wife
and those rose bushes.

1557
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:36,861
No.

1558
02:06:38,322 --> 02:06:42,021
No. That one l save just for me.

1559
02:07:46,539 --> 02:07:48,167
Enemy from the east.

1560
02:07:49,796 --> 02:07:52,510
He sees Tiger tanks, two of 'em.

1561
02:07:52,634 --> 02:07:54,472
Panzer tanks, two of 'em.

1562
02:07:54,597 --> 02:07:56,519
lnfantry,

1563
02:07:56,647 --> 02:07:58,110
50 plus change.

1564
02:08:06,805 --> 02:08:10,811
Disperse! You know what to do!
Reiben, get on the rabbit.

1565
02:08:10,937 --> 02:08:12,648
Upham, get some cover.

1566
02:08:12,772 --> 02:08:14,903
Mellish and Henderson,
lock and load!

1567
02:08:15,028 --> 02:08:16,575
Everybody check your ammo!

1568
02:08:17,787 --> 02:08:19,163
Good luck, Reiben.

1569
02:08:19,287 --> 02:08:21,695
l was born lucky, sarge.

1570
02:08:35,441 --> 02:08:36,739
One in five tracer?

1571
02:08:36,862 --> 02:08:38,865
Yep, and tracers
point both ways.

1572
02:08:38,992 --> 02:08:42,358
Yeah? Check her head space
and she should run.

1573
02:08:50,653 --> 02:08:53,156
Upham! Hustle up!

1574
02:09:42,953 --> 02:09:45,036
- Corporal Upham?
- Yes, sir.

1575
02:09:45,161 --> 02:09:47,578
We don't have
a .30-calibre here.

1576
02:09:47,704 --> 02:09:50,627
Either Mr Mellish
or Mr Jackson needs that.

1577
02:09:50,753 --> 02:09:51,795
Yes, sir.

1578
02:09:52,965 --> 02:09:54,301
Upham! Jackson's fine.

1579
02:09:54,426 --> 02:09:55,387
Turn around to Mellish.

1580
02:10:17,011 --> 02:10:20,596
l don't know if they
took the bait, Captain.

1581
02:10:45,642 --> 02:10:47,977
You got any more of that?

1582
02:11:33,639 --> 02:11:35,561
Panzers didn't take the bait.

1583
02:11:40,693 --> 02:11:43,683
lnfantry's moving to the left.

1584
02:11:43,807 --> 02:11:47,143
Half-track just went by
with about 20 troops.

1585
02:13:27,626 --> 02:13:29,795
Displace!

1586
02:13:50,834 --> 02:13:52,626
Do it now! Light it!

1587
02:13:52,753 --> 02:13:54,547
You! Light it!

1588
02:14:05,882 --> 02:14:07,882
30 infantry on the right flank!

1589
02:14:08,008 --> 02:14:10,553
Get over there and stop 'em!

1590
02:14:10,678 --> 02:14:11,805
Displace!

1591
02:14:23,729 --> 02:14:24,770
Upham!

1592
02:14:40,456 --> 02:14:41,588
Clear!

1593
02:14:43,869 --> 02:14:44,866
Krauts!

1594
02:14:46,908 --> 02:14:47,995
Right flank!

1595
02:15:00,468 --> 02:15:02,176
Sanitater!

1596
02:15:24,806 --> 02:15:27,847
Get down! Get down!

1597
02:15:34,228 --> 02:15:37,219
Upham! Upham! .30-cal! Hurry!

1598
02:15:37,344 --> 02:15:40,933
And find the captain!
This flank's going to fold!

1599
02:16:35,737 --> 02:16:38,119
Reversing!
He's still in this fight!

1600
02:16:39,747 --> 02:16:42,670
No, no, Ryan, get down!
Get down!

1601
02:17:19,051 --> 02:17:21,046
- Ryan.
- Get off me!

1602
02:17:21,171 --> 02:17:23,627
- You all right?
- Get off me!

1603
02:17:23,752 --> 02:17:25,711
l'm fine, too, Captain(!)

1604
02:17:25,835 --> 02:17:28,375
OK, both sides!

1605
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:30,420
Get a grenade in there!

1606
02:17:34,137 --> 02:17:35,512
Grenade!

1607
02:17:37,603 --> 02:17:40,480
- 20-mil!
- 20-mil!

1608
02:17:40,605 --> 02:17:42,391
Flak gun. Take it out!

1609
02:17:55,819 --> 02:17:59,119
Heavy weapon below!
l ain't got a shot!

1610
02:18:03,816 --> 02:18:05,608
Pincer move, Parker!

1611
02:18:05,733 --> 02:18:07,153
Targets eight o'clock low!

1612
02:18:07,277 --> 02:18:08,195
Shit!

1613
02:18:08,323 --> 02:18:09,819
God grant me strength.

1614
02:18:23,830 --> 02:18:25,747
Come on! Displace!

1615
02:18:25,873 --> 02:18:26,838
Come on!

1616
02:18:43,390 --> 02:18:44,930
Cover, Upham! Cover!

1617
02:18:45,058 --> 02:18:46,471
Cover!

1618
02:19:02,841 --> 02:19:04,966
l'm out of .30-calibre.

1619
02:19:07,595 --> 02:19:10,261
Blessed be the Lord,
my strength,

1620
02:19:10,387 --> 02:19:12,681
which teaches my hands to war.

1621
02:19:21,692 --> 02:19:24,232
My goodness and my fortress...

1622
02:19:24,356 --> 02:19:26,523
my high tower
and my deliverer...

1623
02:19:29,858 --> 02:19:32,629
my shield
and He in whom l trust.

1624
02:20:00,784 --> 02:20:02,151
Parker, get down!

1625
02:20:24,204 --> 02:20:26,454
Captain, that 20-millimetre's
killing us.

1626
02:20:26,579 --> 02:20:29,039
We gotta try to flank it.

1627
02:20:29,165 --> 02:20:32,710
Well, let me get over
for the top shot.

1628
02:21:18,942 --> 02:21:21,606
Upham, ammo, Goddamit!

1629
02:22:04,087 --> 02:22:06,838
l'm jammed! l'm jammed!
Got any .30-cal?

1630
02:22:06,963 --> 02:22:08,672
- l'm out.
- Shit.

1631
02:23:49,072 --> 02:23:52,785
l'm out! l need a bandolier!
Anybody got a bandolier?

1632
02:24:18,250 --> 02:24:21,792
God! God!

1633
02:24:24,705 --> 02:24:25,872
You stupid...

1634
02:25:11,360 --> 02:25:14,113
Let's stop. Listen to me!
Listen to me! Stop!

1635
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:16,578
No! D-d-d-d...Stop. Stop.

1636
02:25:51,935 --> 02:25:54,623
Son of...son of a bitch!

1637
02:25:54,707 --> 02:25:57,422
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

1638
02:25:57,548 --> 02:25:59,009
Son of a bitch!

1639
02:26:00,135 --> 02:26:02,009
Son of a bitch!

1640
02:27:20,999 --> 02:27:22,328
l'm out.

1641
02:27:22,452 --> 02:27:23,826
Those .60 rounds.

1642
02:27:25,744 --> 02:27:27,076
We can use them
without the tube.

1643
02:27:27,202 --> 02:27:28,660
How?

1644
02:27:28,786 --> 02:27:32,079
Fuse-arming wire, set back,
heave it!

1645
02:27:47,072 --> 02:27:48,322
Panzer schreck!

1646
02:28:23,225 --> 02:28:25,224
We're going to the Alamo.

1647
02:28:35,274 --> 02:28:37,111
Alamo! Alamo!

1648
02:28:57,083 --> 02:28:59,087
We'll take it! You fall back!

1649
02:28:59,214 --> 02:29:00,672
You be right behind us!

1650
02:29:00,798 --> 02:29:02,753
Soon as we're in business!

1651
02:29:06,836 --> 02:29:08,046
Displace.

1652
02:29:11,419 --> 02:29:12,378
Reload.

1653
02:30:01,917 --> 02:30:03,455
All right, go.

1654
02:30:04,706 --> 02:30:07,457
We're blowing the bridge!
Clear the bridge!

1655
02:30:31,555 --> 02:30:33,851
Sarge! Mike, are you all right?

1656
02:30:33,975 --> 02:30:37,902
- l just got the winded.
- Get out of here!

1657
02:30:38,026 --> 02:30:40,072
We're gonna blow this bridge!

1658
02:30:42,195 --> 02:30:43,775
Come on, come on!

1659
02:30:48,487 --> 02:30:50,817
Tiger coming!
Coming across the bridge!

1660
02:32:38,632 --> 02:32:39,590
Captain.

1661
02:32:43,341 --> 02:32:46,383
Captain, where are you going?
Get back here!

1662
02:35:12,041 --> 02:35:13,835
Hang in there, Captain.

1663
02:35:59,082 --> 02:36:00,082
Medic!

1664
02:36:03,664 --> 02:36:04,706
Medic!

1665
02:36:04,832 --> 02:36:06,415
We got a medic?

1666
02:36:12,497 --> 02:36:15,227
They're tank-busters,
sir. P-51s.

1667
02:36:16,522 --> 02:36:18,332
Angels on our shoulders.

1668
02:36:24,592 --> 02:36:25,677
What, sir?

1669
02:36:31,507 --> 02:36:35,472
James... Earn this.

1670
02:36:40,231 --> 02:36:41,899
Earn it.

1671
02:37:11,121 --> 02:37:14,413
My dear Mrs Ryan,

1672
02:37:14,542 --> 02:37:16,961
it's with a
profound sense of joy

1673
02:37:17,086 --> 02:37:21,845
that l write to inform you
your son Private James Ryan

1674
02:37:21,969 --> 02:37:24,424
is well and,
at this very moment,

1675
02:37:24,554 --> 02:37:27,674
on his way home
from European battlefields.

1676
02:37:27,799 --> 02:37:31,797
Reports from the front indicate
James did his duty in combat

1677
02:37:31,928 --> 02:37:35,680
with great courage
and steadfast dedication

1678
02:37:35,804 --> 02:37:38,476
even after informed
of the tragic loss

1679
02:37:38,561 --> 02:37:42,354
your family has suffered
in this great campaign

1680
02:37:42,480 --> 02:37:45,647
to rid the world
of tyranny and oppression.

1681
02:37:45,771 --> 02:37:49,188
l take great pleasure in joining
the Secretary of War,

1682
02:37:49,314 --> 02:37:51,103
the United States Army

1683
02:37:51,229 --> 02:37:53,815
and the citizens
of a grateful nation

1684
02:37:53,939 --> 02:37:57,196
in wishing you good health
and many years of happiness

1685
02:37:57,321 --> 02:38:00,289
with James at your side.

1686
02:38:00,411 --> 02:38:05,101
Nothing, not even the safe
return of a beloved son,

1687
02:38:05,225 --> 02:38:09,646
can compensate you or the
thousands of other families

1688
02:38:09,768 --> 02:38:13,144
who have suffered great loss
in this tragic war.

1689
02:38:13,268 --> 02:38:15,982
l share with you
some words which sustained me

1690
02:38:16,106 --> 02:38:20,408
through long, dark nights
of peril, loss and heartache.

1691
02:38:20,533 --> 02:38:23,529
And l quote,

1692
02:38:23,656 --> 02:38:25,530
''l pray that
our heavenly father

1693
02:38:25,655 --> 02:38:28,576
''may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement

1694
02:38:28,699 --> 02:38:30,820
''and leave you only
the cherished memory

1695
02:38:30,945 --> 02:38:32,741
''of the loved and lost

1696
02:38:32,864 --> 02:38:35,702
''and the solemn pride
that must be yours

1697
02:38:35,827 --> 02:38:38,499
''to have laid
so costly a sacrifice

1698
02:38:38,583 --> 02:38:40,880
''upon the alter of freedom.

1699
02:38:41,003 --> 02:38:43,004
''Abraham Lincoln.''

1700
02:38:43,128 --> 02:38:45,671
Yours very sincerely
and respectfully,

1701
02:38:45,795 --> 02:38:48,628
George C Marshall,
General, Chief of Staff.

1702
02:39:39,852 --> 02:39:42,977
My family is with me today.

1703
02:39:43,102 --> 02:39:45,354
They wanted to come with me.

1704
02:39:47,625 --> 02:39:49,167
To be honest with you,

1705
02:39:49,292 --> 02:39:53,000
l wasn't sure how l'd feel
coming back here.

1706
02:39:55,421 --> 02:39:59,097
Every day l think about
what you said to me

1707
02:39:59,220 --> 02:40:01,222
that day on the bridge.

1708
02:40:02,431 --> 02:40:07,555
And l've tried to live my life
the best l could.

1709
02:40:07,682 --> 02:40:10,803
l hope that was enough.

1710
02:40:10,930 --> 02:40:13,974
l hope that,
at least in your eyes,

1711
02:40:15,392 --> 02:40:19,194
l've earned what all of you
have done for me.

1712
02:40:32,569 --> 02:40:33,819
James.

1713
02:40:36,158 --> 02:40:38,331
Captain John H Miller.

1714
02:40:46,835 --> 02:40:49,583
Tell me l've led a good life.

1715
02:40:49,707 --> 02:40:50,790
What?

1716
02:40:51,915 --> 02:40:54,335
Tell me l'm a good man.

1717
02:41:01,471 --> 02:41:03,055
You are.
