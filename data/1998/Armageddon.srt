1
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:55,304
This is the Earth at a time

2
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,808
when the dinosaurs roamed
a lush and fertile planet.

3
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:11,111
A piece of rock just six miles wide

4
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,155
changed all that.

5
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,000
It hit with the force
of 10,000 nuclear weapons.

6
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:32,716
A trillion tons of dirt and rock
hurtled into the atmosphere,

7
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,511
creating a suffocating blanket of dust

8
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,222
the sun was powerless to penetrate

9
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,724
for a thousand years.

10
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,734
It happened before.

11
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,946
It will happen again.

12
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,408
It's just a question of when.

13
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,223
Houston, affirmative.

14
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,518
Now try again.

15
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,815
Almost got it.

16
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:36,738
- Atlantis, I'm almost there.
- Houston, Pete's lookin' real strong.

17
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:40,075
Okay, Pete, we got that coupling
on the board here now.

18
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,495
We'll give you the go-ahead
from down here when it's in alignment.

19
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,332
Sounds good. Give me ten seconds.

20
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,086
His heart rate's racing. Hey, Pete.

21
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,671
- It's Truman.
- Hey.

22
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,882
- How you doing up there, hoss?
- Pretty good.

23
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,342
Listen, Pete, we got an eye
on your meds here.

24
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,677
I'll give you a buffalo nickel

25
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,679
if you'll calm down just a little bit.

26
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,473
- Can you do that for me?
- Whatever you say.

27
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:07,060
Okay, now, we got plenty of time,
buddy, so don't you worry.

28
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,358
Looking good here.

29
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,484
He'll be all right.

30
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,612
- Go ahead, Atlantis.
- Roger that, Houston.

31
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,447
Suggest we start reeling Pete in.

32
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,420
- What the hell is that?
- My Lord.

33
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:40,844
We're down!

34
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,599
Houston!

35
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,562
We've lost all contact.

36
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,317
Stewart, play that tape back!

37
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,323
Houston!

38
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,744
Multiple bogies! Multiple bogies!

39
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,914
Sector five, niner. I have three. Now five.

40
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,041
- Unidentified tracks.
- My screen's full.

41
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,168
Multiple tracks headed toward
the Atlantic seaboard!

42
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,836
This could be a surprise missile attack.

43
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,929
Mr. President, the shuttle
Atlantis just exploded in space.

44
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:28,058
Okay, I want three groups!
One, internal malfunction.

45
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,978
Get the log tape.
Start working back. Maybe it's a glitch.

46
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,772
Two, I want NORAD,
Space Command and the 50th tactical,

47
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,441
comparing all the space junk
you tracked in every orbit.

48
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,986
I want you to check, recheck
and then do it all over again.

49
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,989
Number three, wild cards.
Anything and everything.

50
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,575
All right? Now, Big Ross, get on
the telephone. Wake up 11,000 people.

51
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,119
- Walt, get 'em going.
- Let's go!

52
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:52,040
Karl. Karl! Karl.

53
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,962
Karl! Your Stouffer's pot pie's

54
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,631
been on the table almost ten hours.

55
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,009
- I want a divorce.
- Dottie, I'm on to something big here.

56
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,429
I... I don't know what this is, but it
looks like something's burnin' up there.

57
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,347
Go get my phone book, will you?
Get my phone book.

58
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,349
Get those names
of those guys from NASA.

59
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:14,396
Excuse me! Am I wearing a sign
that says, "Karl's Slave"?

60
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,649
Go get my goddamn phone book!

61
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,944
Get the book! Get the book!
Get the book!

62
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,161
Space Command is reporting negative.
That is zero global launches.

63
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,496
It might just be a piece of the shuttle
breaking up as it comes in.

64
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,789
It might be Santa Claus.

65
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,126
Until we get definitive,
reliable confirmation, General,

66
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,378
we go to DEFCON Three.

67
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,054
I'm gettin' ready for the big time

68
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,557
Someday you're gonna say
I'm big time, too

69
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,019
Hey, little man! Little Richard!

70
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,688
Me and you, man!
We're going to the top, baby!

71
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,776
Big time! I ain't gonna be ridin'
this bike for the rest of my life.

72
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,236
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm gettin' a motorcycle, baby.

73
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,447
We're gonna travel in style.

74
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,285
I'm gettin' ready for the big time

75
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,871
Someday I'm gonna be in big time news

76
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:16,875
Watch where you're goin'. I bet you,
none of you all stop for brothers.

77
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,627
Slow down, Little Richard.

78
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,921
You've been ridin' all morning.
You gotta take a dump?

79
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,133
We interrupt our regularly
scheduled program...

80
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,551
- What happened?
... to bring you this special report.

81
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:32,307
The shuttle ATLantis exploded in space
at 3:47 a. m., Eastern Standard Time.

82
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,522
Hey! Get, get.

83
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,319
- That's my Godzilla. Come on, now.
- Yo, fool!

84
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,571
Don't be kickin' Little Richard.
What the hell your problem?

85
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,908
That dog's eatin' my Godzilla. What's
a little runt like you gonna do about it?

86
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,077
Get him, Richard. Sic him.
If I wasn't no Christian,

87
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:56,123
I'd be throwin' your fat pineapple-eatin'
ass through the window.

88
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,511
Why we not going?

89
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,596
You know why?
'Cause this is New York City.

90
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,975
Anything could happen. Let's see.
Could've been a terrorist bomb.

91
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,437
Could've been a dead body. Somebody
shot, stabbed, and it's Friday, payday.

92
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,605
Dude, somebody probably didn't
get their paycheck. Yes?

93
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,149
I want to go shopping.

94
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:26,653
Me, too, but we ain't goin' nowhere
'cause this is a traffic jam.

95
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,822
- Little Richard!
- Right over there!

96
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,992
Little Richard!

97
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,952
Hang on, Little Richard. I'm comin'!

98
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,415
Don't you worry about it.
I'm gonna get you outta there!

99
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,543
You okay, buddy?
Don't worry about it. Hang in there.

100
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,629
Somebody dial 911!

101
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,673
My screen's full.
They're all over the place.

102
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,133
Bogies are breachin' the atmosphere

103
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,343
from Finland down
the North American seaboard.

104
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,444
Look at that!

105
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,785
Oh, we at war!

106
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,748
Saddam Hussein is bombing us!

107
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,012
Let's stay focused. We need to

108
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,056
- map the trajectory now.
- That could take a week.

109
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,642
Just find it, okay? I wanna know if
the worst is over or if it's on its way.

110
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,435
We've got General Kimsey on the line.

111
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,397
We've got hits from Finland
to South Carolina.

112
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,148
We know they're not missiles.
Now what the hell is it?

113
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,652
It's a meteor shower.
That's what took out the shuttle.

114
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,116
I've got the president
on AirForce One demanding answers.

115
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,577
Is it over?

116
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:42,163
General, we've got 11,000 people at
NASA trying to figure that out right now.

117
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,248
When we know, you'll know.

118
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,922
Okay, Karl, listen.
I want you to take your time.

119
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,465
Yes, sir. You're definitely the first.

120
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,596
Okay, first coordinate.
One-two-three-nine. 1239, right?

121
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,725
- F.B.I. locked his location.
- Saw an explosion in space.

122
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,268
Okay.

123
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,188
- Listen, Karl, this is top secret.
- Sir, I'm retired Navy.

124
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,317
I know all about classified.
But one more thing.

125
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,319
The person that finds her
gets to name her, right?

126
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:16,865
- Yes, that's right.
- I wanna name her Dottie, after my wife.

127
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,785
She's a vicious life-suckin' bitch
from which there's no escape.

128
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,622
- That's sweet, Karl.
- S.D.I., this is flight director!

129
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,415
I wanna get that Hubble movin',
and I want it now.

130
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,875
Roger that.

131
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,209
We're movin' the Hubble!

132
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,259
It's enormous.

133
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:40,388
This is the anomaly at 1643.

134
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,727
Here is the anomaly at 1658,

135
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,481
and here is the anomaly at 1700.

136
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,484
Enough with this anomaly horseshit!

137
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,487
- What is this thing?
- It's an asteroid, sir.

138
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,323
How big are we talking?

139
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,367
Sir, our best estimate is 97.6 billion...

140
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,453
- It's the size of Texas, Mr. President.
- Y-Yes, sir.

141
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,997
Dan, we didn't see this thing coming?

142
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,291
Well, our object collision
budget's a million dollars.

143
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,502
That allows us to track
about three percent of the sky.

144
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,962
And begging your pardon, sir,
it's a big-ass sky.

145
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,714
- And the ones this morning?
- Those are nothing.

146
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,508
They're the size of basketballs

147
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,343
and Volkswagens, things like that.

148
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:23,181
- Is this going to hit us?
- We're efforting that as we speak, sir.

149
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,934
- What kind of damage are we...
- Damage?

150
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,396
Total, sir.

151
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,898
It's what we call a global killer.

152
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,192
The end of mankind.

153
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,194
Doesn't matter where it hits.

154
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,863
Nothing would survive.
Not even bacteria.

155
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,659
My God. What do we do?

156
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:55,004
We have 18 days before it hits Earth.

157
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,558
Have mercy

158
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,226
Rise and shine!

159
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,565
Stop the drilling!
Stop the drilling! Stop the drilling!

160
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,067
Fore!

161
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,069
Stop the drilling! Stop the drilling!

162
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,072
- Hey!
- Hey, that was close!

163
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,829
I give you 50,000 a year in donations.

164
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,414
What do you think
they're so mad about, Chick?

165
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,375
Well, I think they feel that
drilling for oil is an evil thing.

166
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,295
You know how much diesel
that clunker boat pumps out an hour?

167
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:40,759
I just found out something interesting.
Number two chewed 180 feet last night.

168
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,261
- Who do we have to thank for this?
- I'll give you two guesses.

169
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,180
But you're only gonna need one.

170
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,515
Goddamn it, A.J.!

171
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,517
A.J.!

172
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,856
A.J.! A.J., you in here?

173
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,650
Oh, that's just perfect. In bed. Get up!

174
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:01,780
- Uh, hey, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah, I was lookin' for ya.

175
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,615
You're pissed. Okay, I can see that.

176
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,826
No. You know what, A.J.?
I'm not pissed. You've seen me pissed.

177
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,745
This is way, way beyond pissed, though.

178
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,914
You know I shut down
number two last night, right?

179
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,541
- Yeah, man, I had a hunch on that.
- Let me tell you something.

180
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,419
Someday, many years from now,
when you're all growed up,

181
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,837
and you got your own oil company

182
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,799
and $8 million of your own money
on the contract,

183
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,511
you can do whatever comes into that
little A.J. -idiotin' mind of yours you want.

184
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,763
But as long as it says
"Harry Stamper Oil" on the rig,

185
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,139
you will not disobey my rules.

186
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,099
- You got that?
- Yeah, I do got it.

187
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,393
All right, now I need to hear
five words from you.

188
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,687
- Uh...
- I'll...

189
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,815
Never do that again.

190
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,400
I'm a fool. That was idiotic.
I... I mean, that was stupid.

191
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,152
I'm an idiot. I know
what name's on the sign. I'm not...

192
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,987
- What's goin' on here?
- What's goin' on?

193
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,948
Well, I mean, you know,
I screwed up. I'm a little edgy.

194
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:48,243
- How long you work for me?
- Five wonderful years.

195
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,412
In five years, you have never
apologized to me this quickly.

196
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,498
Something's going on here.
I'm gonna find out what it is.

197
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,292
Well, I'm turning over a new leaf.

198
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,502
I'm trying to learn from the man.

199
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,671
What would Harry do?

200
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,178
I'm at a loss for words.

201
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,014
Okay, I can explain this.

202
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,558
- You can explain that?
- I can.

203
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:15,270
I would really like an explanation.
You just stay right here.

204
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,861
Grace?

205
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,821
Hi, Harry.

206
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,116
I have asked you repeatedly
to call me Dad.

207
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,576
Sorry, Harry.

208
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,953
Get up and get your clothes on.

209
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,375
You just stay right there.
I'll be right back.

210
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,010
Here's what we're gonna do.
I want every strategy we've got

211
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,386
on near-Earth object collision.

212
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,889
Okay? Any ideas, any programs,

213
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,017
anything you sketched
on a pizza box or cocktail napkin.

214
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,102
For 30 years,
they questioned the need for NASA.

215
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,312
Today, we're gonna give 'em
the answer.

216
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,359
You know about this, Rockhound?

217
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,154
- You knew?
- No, I had no idea.

218
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,991
Where's Harry?

219
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,328
Harry, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I understand, okay?

220
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,663
You're mad.
Who... Who wouldn't be mad?

221
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,749
- He's gonna shoot you.
- Nah, no, he's not.

222
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,875
Oh, shit.

223
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,006
- Harry!
- What's wrong with you?

224
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,091
Make your peace with God, A.J.!

225
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,469
This guy's got a gun, man.
He's shooting at me.

226
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,262
Harry, this is not funny!

227
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,806
Harry, listen to me!
We can talk this over!

228
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,185
- Oh, is this a serious thing?
- Yeah, pretty serious.

229
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,436
- Bear!
- What's up?

230
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,855
He's shootin' at me. You see Harry
comin', crack him with that wrench.

231
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,150
You told A.J.'s dad just before he died
that you would take care of the boy.

232
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,527
Now I'm not sure that
shootin' him is takin' care of him.

233
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,695
Why don't you put the gun down?

234
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,656
You don't want none of this.
Get out of my way.

235
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,950
Just tryin' to give my man
a head start, that's all.

236
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,284
Not to mention the fact that I don't think

237
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,953
you wanna kill
the best man on your crew,

238
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,455
- before we strike oil.
- Aw, Chick, I ain't gonna kill him.

239
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:00,291
Just gonna take a foot off.
A man can work with one foot.

240
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,294
You remember old Frank Marx who
worked with one hand all them years?

241
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,587
Yeah, but he wasn't very good.

242
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,423
Harry, put the gun down!
You're acting insane!

243
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,051
Now, honey, go get some clothes on
and get out of the way.

244
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:14,305
- You can't control my life!
- Fine. Clothes. Now!

245
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,556
All right, stop! All right!

246
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,600
It was funny for a minute.
It's not funny anymore.

247
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,563
- Fuck!
- Harry, this is illegal, man.

248
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,816
I'm temporarily insane, Rock.
It's all right.

249
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,656
- Do I look like I'm crazy to you?
- Well...

250
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,825
Harry! Hey, just cool down.

251
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,411
What are you doing?
Harry, stop! Cut it out.

252
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,496
- All right, Harry.
- All right, now, listen.

253
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,250
Man to man. I'm serious. I love her.

254
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,252
Way wrong answer!

255
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,841
- Whoa, whoa, Harry. It's gettin' real.
- Harry! Come on, Harry!

256
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,552
- You shot me!
- You shot him.

257
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,512
That bullet never got close.
Just a ricochet.

258
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,056
You know, it's all funny
till somebody gets shot in the leg!

259
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:01,102
Hey, pucker up.
We got clients incoming.

260
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,523
Uh, b-back in-in... In 1974,

261
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,150
we-we first got the idea

262
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,110
the-the possibility
that-that a meteor or an asteroid...

263
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,946
I need somebody who's had a little less
caffeine this morning. Doc, translate.

264
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:16,951
Yes, sir. Our first feasibility plan was
to use a spread-focus laser generator

265
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,995
to heat the object
to the point of fracture.

266
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,622
That's like shooting a B.B. gun
at a freight train, Doc.

267
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,332
Uh, some of us have got this idea.

268
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,919
We wanna land a craft,
deploy solar sails.

269
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:32,633
You'll have a big canopy. Solar winds
will be caught by these Mylar sails.

270
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,553
- Okay...
- Come on, guys!

271
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:39,307
We gotta come up with something
realistic here. We got 18 days.

272
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,186
That's 431 hours, 15 minutes
and 18 seconds.

273
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,813
Time's a luxury we don't have. What?

274
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,818
Listen, Harry, A.J. is my choice.

275
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,403
My choice and not yours.

276
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,405
He's the only one in
your age bracket, Grace.

277
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,407
It's not a choice. It's a lack of options.

278
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,951
I don't know
what in the world makes you think

279
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,662
that you have the right
to tell me what to do anymore, Harry.

280
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,706
I suppose being your father
doesn't count, huh?

281
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,583
- Not really.
- Since when?

282
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,920
Since I reached the age of ten
and became older than you, Harry.

283
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,297
Since Mom split.
Why don't you take your pick?

284
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,925
Look, I understand that
you are handicapped

285
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,719
by natural immaturity, and I forgive you.

286
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,722
I may be an immature father,
but I'm still your employer.

287
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,766
And as your boss,
I want you on that crew boat tonight

288
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:22,975
and back in the office by Monday.

289
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,020
- You got that?
- Okay. I quit.

290
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,107
Grace, you can't quit now!

291
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,274
I need you to keep on working.

292
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,738
Hi, Harry!

293
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,823
What are you smilin' about?

294
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,703
I've been seein' A.J.
for more than five months, Harry.

295
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,375
You little hypocrite. I ever held you
back once from doing anything?

296
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,043
What about having a life, Harry?

297
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,419
The first time I got my period,

298
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,839
Rockhound had to take me
into Taipei for Tampax

299
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,216
and then he had to show me
how to use 'em, Harry.

300
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,510
Ho-ho.

301
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:01,389
I ju... No, I... I told her how to use it.
I didn't show her, Harry.

302
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,517
I was playing with
titanium depth gauges

303
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,352
when I should've been
playing with dolls.

304
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:10,523
I mean, I learned about the birds and
the bees from Freddy Noonan's tattoos.

305
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,317
Look, I was raised
on roughnecks by you.

306
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,320
And now you get all shocked
and shaken when I fall in love with one.

307
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,239
So who's the hypocrite here,
Harry, huh?

308
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,574
Look at those nice pipes.

309
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,035
- Listen to me, Grace.
- No, you listen to me, Harry. I grew up.

310
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,665
With the proximity
of the asteroid and no prep time,

311
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,625
none of our primary plans can work.

312
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,838
Why don't we just send up 150 nuclear
warheads and blast that rock apart?

313
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,381
Terrible idea.

314
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,508
Was I talkin' to you?

315
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,510
This is Dr. Ronald Quincy
from Research.

316
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,680
Pretty much the smartest man on the
planet. You might wanna listen to him.

317
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,807
General, if you consider your target,

318
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,560
her composition, her dimensions,

319
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,478
her sheer velocity,

320
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,189
you could fire every nuke
you've got on her,

321
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,275
she'll just smile at you
and keep on coming.

322
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,861
You should know that
the president's scientific advisors

323
00:19:56,945 --> 00:20:01,324
are suggesting that a nuclear blast
could change this asteroid's trajectory.

324
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:05,203
I know the president's chief scientific
advisor. We were at M.I.T. together.

325
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,330
And, in a situation like this...

326
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,915
You really don't wanna take the advice

327
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,084
from a man who got
a C-minus in astrophysics.

328
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:17,381
The president's advisors are wrong.
I'm right.

329
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,301
Hitting the rock from
the outside won't do the job.

330
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,512
Imagine a firecracker
in the palm of your hand.

331
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,558
You set it off. What happens?
Burn your hand, right?

332
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,354
You close your fist around
the same firecracker and set it off...

333
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:35,983
Poof! Your wife's gonna be opening your
ketchup bottles the rest of your life.

334
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,236
Are you suggesting that we blow
this thing up from the inside?

335
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,446
- That's exactly what I'm saying.
- How?

336
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,865
We drill.

337
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,076
We bring in the world's best
deep-core driller.

338
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,662
Harry, get up here. We're takin' a hit.

339
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,497
- Get A.J. up here!
- Come on!

340
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,581
Oh, shit!

341
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,085
Send another pipe down! Right now!

342
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,796
It's a gas pocket!

343
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,507
I told you! Am I lucky,
or am I just a genius?

344
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,635
I shut it down for a reason,
you jackass! The relief valve's...

345
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:09,976
Shut off the number two valve!
Grace, get the clients out of here now!

346
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,938
No, Daddy!

347
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,193
Chick, get 'em outta here!
Get 'em off the rig now!

348
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,702
- Get the hell down!
- This thing is gonna blow.

349
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,421
Chick, get down now!

350
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,799
Get down!

351
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,009
Three dozen research calls,

352
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,969
and every time,
the same man is recommended.

353
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,305
He's worked on every terrain
this planet can offer.

354
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,557
Whenever they said it couldn't be
drilled, this guy drilled it.

355
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:53,477
- Everybody all right?
- We struck oil, baby!

356
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,646
Somebody could've got killed
out here today.

357
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,523
You want that on your conscience?

358
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,569
High thumb. You are man, Harry.

359
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,029
Thumbs high.

360
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,576
You're fired.

361
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,000
Who's Harry Stamper?

362
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,836
Hey, I'm Harry Stamper.
What's all this about?

363
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,506
Mr. Stamper, I'm General Montgomery,
commander of the Pacific Air Forces.

364
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,633
I've been sent here
by the Secretary of Defense

365
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,845
on direct orders
from the President of the United States.

366
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,848
It's a matter of urgent national security.

367
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:34,435
I need you to get on that chopper
right now, no questions asked.

368
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,228
Crazy Willie put you up to this?

369
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:40,775
I'm afraid I don't know Crazy Willie,
sir. I'm dead serious about this.

370
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,195
- Harry.
- What?

371
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,822
I swear to God,
she never told me her age.

372
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,451
It's all right. Relax. It's about me.

373
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,536
Oh. Forget it!

374
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,961
All right, General,
I'll go with you on one condition.

375
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,963
We're gonna have
to take my daughter along.

376
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,717
What did I do?

377
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:07,885
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you guys takin' her?

378
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,513
- Sir, stay right here.
- Wh...

379
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:13,140
Chick, get him paid, get him off the rig!

380
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,487
- Mr. Stamper?
- Yeah, I'm Harry Stamper.

381
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,864
How you doin'? Miss Stamper.

382
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,658
I'm Dan Truman,
Executive Director here.

383
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,910
Listen, on behalf of all of us,
I'd really like to apologize...

384
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,704
Apologize. I don't know if we can take
any more apologies, Mr. Truman.

385
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,707
We've been apologized to
for the last 18-and-a-half hours.

386
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,085
So if you don't mind, how about
if we just get on with it?

387
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,838
You tell us why we're here
at the NASA Space Center.

388
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,756
We should probably talk alone.

389
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,676
Mr. Truman, I don't keep
any secrets from my daughter, Grace.

390
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,636
So whether you tell her now
or I tell her later,

391
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,096
she's gonna find out
one way or the other.

392
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,722
So, why don't we just get on with it?

393
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,225
So when the Rogue comet
hit the asteroid belt,

394
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,185
it sent shrapnel right for us.

395
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,938
For the next 15 days,
the Earth's in a shooting gallery.

396
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:05,109
Even if the asteroid itself
hits the water, it's still hitting land.

397
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,778
It'll flash boil
millions of gallons of seawater

398
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,281
and slam into the ocean bedrock.

399
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:13,784
Now, if it's a Pacific Ocean impact,
which we think it will be,

400
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,787
it'll create a tidal wave three miles high,

401
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,414
traveling at 1,000 miles an hour

402
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,834
covering California
and washing up in Denver.

403
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:25,421
Japan's gone. Australia's wiped out.

404
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,424
Half the world's population
will be incinerated by the heat blast.

405
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,469
The rest'll freeze to death
from nuclear winter.

406
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,512
That's unbelievable.

407
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,558
Well, actually, this is as real as it gets.

408
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,938
Well, it's coming right now.

409
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,066
Right for us at 22,000 miles an hour.

410
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,736
Not a soul on Earth can hide from it.

411
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,254
I take it you're not
alerting everyone like this.

412
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,508
Nobody knows. That's the way it stays.

413
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,344
For the next ten days, there are
only nine telescopes in the world

414
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,930
that can spot the asteroid,
and we control eight of 'em.

415
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,016
The president's classified
this information top secret.

416
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,726
If news like this got out,

417
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,230
there'd be an overnight breakdown
of basic social services worldwide.

418
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:29,693
Rioting, mass religious hysteria,
total chaos, you can imagine.

419
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,780
Basically the worst parts of the Bible.

420
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:38,744
Six billion people on the planet.

421
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,788
Why'd you guys call me?

422
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:42,665
We need you to prep the team

423
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,416
- we're sending up.
- Up?

424
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,709
We'll send them to the asteroid,

425
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,254
they'll land, drill a hole,
they'll drop some nukes,

426
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,048
take off and detonate,
if we can fix this equipment problem.

427
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:55,886
The drilling unit's a prototype we've
been building for the Mars project.

428
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,181
You, uh... You might recognize the rig.

429
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:04,520
Yeah, well, I guess
I should recognize it. It's my design.

430
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,400
Did you steal a key to the Patent Office?

431
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,651
Yeah, basically.

432
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,821
Let me get this straight.
I got pulled off an oil rig,

433
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,116
flown halfway around the world
because you stole my drill design.

434
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,036
Couldn't read the plans right and did
a pisspoor job of putting it together.

435
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,581
- Patents don't apply to outer space.
- You shut up, Quincy.

436
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:27,084
It's not going to Mars anymore.
It's gonna try to save this planet.

437
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,211
And we need to know
what's wrong with it pretty quick.

438
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,255
You said we did a bad job
of putting it together?

439
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:34,842
No, I said you did a pisspoor job
of putting it together.

440
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,470
First of all, you got the flow system
all reversed. Let me guess.

441
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,557
You've been tearin' up rotors
and you can't figure out why.

442
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,683
Yeah, that's right.

443
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,561
Well, that's because your cams
are all wrong, Mr. Wizard.

444
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,980
Who's been operating this thing?

445
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,566
- Right there.
- We've actually...

446
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,860
We've had them training
for eight months solid now.

447
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,653
Eight whole months?

448
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,031
- Well, pretty much, yeah.
- Well, gee whiz.

449
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,408
Well, this is the team
that has to do the job up there.

450
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,577
We need you to train them down here.

451
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,621
Well, Mr. Stamper, what do you think?

452
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,290
You know, drilling's a science.
It's an art.

453
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,917
I'm a third generation driller,
doin' it all my life.

454
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,295
I still haven't got it all figured out.

455
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:15,007
I assume you sent for me because
somebody told you I was the best.

456
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,635
Well, I'm only the best
because I work with the best.

457
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,472
You don't trust the men you're working
with, you're as good as dead.

458
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,974
Now you wanna send
these boys into space, fine.

459
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,726
I'm sure they'll make good astronauts,

460
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,520
but they don't knowjack about drillin'.

461
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,273
- What's your contingency plan?
- Contingency plan?

462
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,193
Your backup plan. You gotta have
some kind of backup plan, right?

463
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,653
No, we don't have a backup plan.

464
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:37,363
- This is it.
- This is the best that you could...

465
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:41,158
That the government...
The U.S. government can come up with.

466
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,536
I mean, you're NASA for cryin' out loud.
You put a man on the moon.

467
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,873
You're geniuses.
You're the guys that think this shit up.

468
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,501
I'm sure you got a team of men
sittin' around somewhere right now,

469
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,961
just thinkin' shit up
and somebody backin' them up.

470
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,171
You tell me
you don't have a backup plan,

471
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,714
that these eight Boy Scouts right here,

472
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,676
that is the world's hope,
that's what you're tellin' me?

473
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,346
- Yeah.
- Oh, Jesus. Damn it.

474
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,642
We're a little short on time here.
Will you help us?

475
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,816
- All they gotta do is drill?
- That's it.

476
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,694
No spacewalkin',
no crazy astronaut stuff.

477
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,112
Just drill.

478
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,074
How many men were you
plannin' on takin' up there?

479
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,201
We're sendin' up
two shuttles, two teams.

480
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,537
If I do this,
I'm gonna wanna take my own men.

481
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,789
You got it.

482
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,793
- So you're saying you'll help us?
- Yes, sir.

483
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,045
Thanks.

484
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,972
I just don't trust
anybody else to do it, that's all.

485
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,435
No, Mrs. Curlene.

486
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,440
It's Harry Stamper. You see Bear,
you tell him Harry's lookin' for him.

487
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,734
Those guys get off this rig, they scatter.

488
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,610
Jayotis Kerleen Bear.

489
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:02,740
Probably the only black man
on a big dog in Kadoka, South Dakota.

490
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,325
Come and get Papa Bear!

491
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,664
- Uh, Max.
- You got a weight limit on the shuttle?

492
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,918
- Max.
- Hey, Mama.

493
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,755
So sweet, Maxie.

494
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,048
Hey, would you give me one of them
yellowjelly bear claws I like?

495
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,718
- Are you in trouble with the law again?
- No, Mama.

496
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:25,053
- Maxie.
- I swear, Mama. I'm...

497
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,766
You know I want Rockhound.

498
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,603
We call him Hound because,
well, he's horny.

499
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:38,025
You might wanna start
with every bar in New Orleans.

500
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,069
That is a big, shiny mount, isn't it?

501
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,155
- How long you been married?
- For two weeks.

502
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,866
- See this diamond?
- Yeah.

503
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,242
It's not a diamond.

504
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,994
- Would you like another drink?
- Yeah.

505
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,705
- Sir, F.B.I.
- So cute. No, thanks.

506
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,541
- We have a national security matter.
- Good for you.

507
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:59,171
- Let's go. Now.
- How old are you?

508
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:02,800
Oscar Choi. Spacy but
absolutely brilliant geologist.

509
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,803
He owns a horse ranch
outside of El Paso.

510
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,015
What the...

511
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,603
Mr. Chick Chapple, at the craps table.

512
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,481
Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas, Nevada.

513
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:20,359
Yes! About time.

514
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,653
Charles Chapple, game's over.

515
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:30,536
Who's gonna run the other rig?
How about Benny? He's good.

516
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,539
The only one who knows how
to run it as well as I do is A.J.

517
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,041
I thought you said
you couldn't trust him.

518
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,709
I thought you said I could.

519
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,506
Yep, you are on your way, A.J.

520
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:46,218
Well, being in business
for yourself has its advantages.

521
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:49,638
Make my own hours,
nobody shoots me in the leg.

522
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,016
You don't got a gun
on you now, do you?

523
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,270
Oh, good, 'cause I kinda wanted
to get back to this whole thing

524
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,772
about you askin' me for help.

525
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,858
Does that mean that there's a job

526
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:05,362
that Mr. All-Go-No-Quit-Big-Nuts
Harry Stamper

527
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:09,867
can't handle by himself
and needs my expert advice?

528
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,159
Somethin' like that, yeah.

529
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,744
Well, no, no, no, no, no, no.

530
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:16,540
I mean, is it something
like that, or is it that?

531
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,376
You know, you and me
got a real problem.

532
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,546
You know, Harry, there are only

533
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,632
five words I wanna hear
from you right now.

534
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,758
Those words are:

535
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:30,220
You know, A.J., I really look up to you.

536
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,848
You've been a hero of mine
for a long time,

537
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,266
and I'm very impressed with your work.

538
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,393
I'm emotionally closed off.

539
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,562
That's like...
That's like 11 words or something.

540
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:42,065
You know what?
How about just, "A.J., I'm sorry,

541
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,068
- and I love ya. "
- You know, A.J.,

542
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:48,488
there's not a job on the planet
I want you to work with me on.

543
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,409
I mean that.

544
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,497
So what are you doin' here?
Harry, what's the job?

545
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,502
- Hey, Bear.
- What's up, baby?

546
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,671
Yeah, baby. What's up? What's up?

547
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,427
What's up, Harry?
Did NASA find oil on Uranus, man?

548
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,439
None of you have to go.
We can just sit here on Earth,

549
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:25,275
wait for this big rock to crash into it

550
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,736
and kill everything
and everybody we know.

551
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:33,283
The United States government
just asked us to save the world.

552
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,161
- Anybody wanna say no?
- Twenty years.

553
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:41,875
Haven't turned you down once.
I'm not about to start now.

554
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,835
I'm there.

555
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,213
Guess I can't let you go up there alone.

556
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,048
I'm with you.

557
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,968
I mean, this is... This is historic.

558
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:54,304
Guys, this is like deep blue hero stuff.

559
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,681
Of course I'm in.

560
00:32:55,765 --> 00:33:00,477
While I don't share
his enthusiasm, you know me.

561
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,063
Beam me up, Scotty.

562
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,983
- You all right, Max?
- I-I don't... I-I don't...

563
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,029
Whatever you think.

564
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,491
- What about you?
- I'm in.

565
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,493
All right, then.

566
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,663
We go.

567
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:24,001
I don't mean to be
the materialistic weasel of this group,

568
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,253
but you think we'll get
hazard pay out of this?

569
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,839
If you're trying to make me feel better
about this scenario, give it up.

570
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,258
To tell you the truth, I'm kind
of encouraged. This guy Chick here

571
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,968
was an Air Force commando
for six years.

572
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:36,680
We got robbery, assault,
arrest, resisting arrest.

573
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,348
We got a collection agent for the mob.

574
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,017
Two of these guys
have done serious time.

575
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,436
- Look, they're the best at what they do.
- So am I.

576
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,438
And I'm not so optimistic.

577
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,733
We spend $250 billion a year
on defense.

578
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,360
And here we are. The fate
of the planet is in the hands

579
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,946
of a bunch of retards
I wouldn't trust with a potato gun.

580
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,869
So, what's the verdict?

581
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:02,247
They'll do it. They've made
a few requests though.

582
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,041
Such as?

583
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,128
Just a few things here.

584
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:16,053
Nothing really big.
Just... Well, as an example...

585
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:19,181
Uh, Oscar here's got some
outstanding parking tickets.

586
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,557
Wants 'em wiped off his record.

587
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,309
Fifty-six tickets in seven states.

588
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,728
- I'll tell him, Oscar. I got it.
- Okay.

589
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,439
Uh, Noonan's got two women friends

590
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,442
that he'd like to see made
American citizens, no questions asked.

591
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:35,238
Max would like you
to bring back eight-track tapes.

592
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:39,076
Not sure if that's gonna work,
but let's see what else.

593
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:44,289
Chick wants a full week's
Emperor's Package at Caesar's Palace.

594
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:49,127
Hey, you guys wouldn't be able to tell us
who actually killed Kennedy, would ya?

595
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:56,051
Uh, Bear would like to stay at the...

596
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,096
White Horse.

597
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,765
White House. White House.

598
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,683
White House. Yeah, he'd like to stay in

599
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,268
the Lincoln Bedroom
of the White House

600
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,770
for the summer.

601
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,480
Stuff like that.

602
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:13,193
Sure, I think we can
take care of some of that.

603
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,237
Harry!

604
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,699
Yeah, one more thing.

605
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:24,037
None of them wanna pay taxes again.

606
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,040
Ever.

607
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,800
Who's that for? Mr. Ed?

608
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:39,219
You stick that in me, I'm gonna
stab you in the heart with it.

609
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,720
You ever see Pulp Fiction?

610
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:45,892
Oh, say can you see

611
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,018
Uh-oh.

612
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,522
We're losin' him, we're losin' him.
Clear! Kaboom!

613
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,650
- Freddy, you all right?
- Does this look okay to you?

614
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:57,988
- Does this look okay?
- It's not all bad. It's kinda tingly.

615
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,740
Mr. Chapple, you're next!

616
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,451
Oh, gee, lady, I just came here to drill.

617
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,912
Oh, so did I.

618
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,917
Your triglycerides are way high,

619
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,879
and your bad cholesterol
is shockingly bad.

620
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:17,090
Gotta lay off those pork rinds, Bear!

621
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,926
Pork rinds this! Yeah!

622
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,100
Well, at least they're in good spirits.

623
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:34,524
Piece of cake.
Look, you wanna compare brain pans?

624
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,402
I won the Westinghouse prize
when I was 12. Big deal.

625
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:41,489
Published at 19. So what? I got
a double doctorate from M.I.T. at 22.

626
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:45,327
Chemistry and geology. I taught
at Princeton for two-and-a-half years.

627
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,037
You know, I think this might be

628
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,331
the most uncomfortable room
I've ever been in in my life.

629
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:52,584
Why do I do this? Because the
money's good, the scenery changes,

630
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,920
and they let me use explosives, okay?

631
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,756
Okay, you wanna be
all psychological with me, that's fine.

632
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,425
I'll tell you one thing
that really drives me nuts

633
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,887
is people who think Jethro Tull
is just a person in the band.

634
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,264
Who is Jethro Tull?

635
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:10,352
My favorite dish is haggis.
Heart, lungs, liver.

636
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:13,813
You shove that all
in a sheep's stomach, then you boil it.

637
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,273
That'll put some hair on your ass.

638
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,693
I am not crazy. I'm just
a little emotional right now, okay?

639
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,571
You're all throwin'
all this stuff at me, man. I mean...

640
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,157
After this is over, could I, like,
get a hug from you or somethin'?

641
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,578
Okay, Cyclops lady is startin' to bug me.

642
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,746
Can you handle it?

643
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,665
I mean, I can handle what I'm,
you know, gonna do.

644
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,042
I can handle that, but I don't know
if I can handle this room.

645
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,044
Woman with large breasts.

646
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,756
Woman with medium breasts.

647
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,758
Here's Harry givin' me a hard time.

648
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,969
And this is Harry tellin' me
it's not good enough.

649
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,388
And this is Harry tellin' me
I can't marry his daughter.

650
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,681
Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

651
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,932
Just let it out.

652
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,103
I suffered a major head injury
when I was in high school.

653
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,523
This one looks like you, with breasts.

654
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,775
Yeah, I can handle it.
Yeah, I can handle it.

655
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:05,073
A home run!
The Cubs win the World Series! Ah...

656
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:09,286
Fail. Fail. Depressively fail.

657
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,622
One toxicology analysis
revealed catamen.

658
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,791
That is a very powerful sedative.

659
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,668
Sedatives are used all the time, Doctor.

660
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,712
This one's used on horses.

661
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,007
Some of these guys are pretty big.

662
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,968
It would normally take 18 months
to psychologically prepare,

663
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,387
prescreen viable subjects
for space travel.

664
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,598
We have seen evidence of a wide
variety of territorial aggression.

665
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:34,561
Can they physically survive the trip?
That's all I need to know here, okay?

666
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,731
Personally, I don't know
how they survived the tests.

667
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,738
Talk about the wrong stuff.

668
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,077
Good morning. I'm Colonel Willie Sharp.

669
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,997
In addition to flying
one of the X-71 teams to that rock,

670
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,498
my job is to train you to deal with

671
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,626
the mental and physical rigors
of working in space,

672
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,963
so you don't freak out on the asteroid.

673
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:05,383
United States astronauts train for years.

674
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,469
You have 12 days.

675
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:10,430
Do we have any intelligent
questions before we get started?

676
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,224
What's an X-71?

677
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,478
You're the first civilians to ever see her.

678
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,439
We call 'em the X-71 s.

679
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,150
It's a top secret joint venture
with the Air Force.

680
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,653
She and her sister ship in Vandenberg
are leaving for launch prep in Florida.

681
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,988
Thought you oughta take a look.

682
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:30,033
The two shuttles going up are
the Freedom and Independence.

683
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:33,578
Her titanium alloy impenetrable
skin covers the toughest, meanest,

684
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,581
most sophisticated space vehicle
man has ever made.

685
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,292
Okay, Air Force Colonel Davis,
NASA pilot Tucker

686
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,419
will command the shuttle
Independence.

687
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:45,173
Air Force Colonel Sharp,
NASA pilot Watts, shuttle Freedom.

688
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:49,511
Munitions specialist Gruber and Halsey
will supervise the nuclear ordinance.

689
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,639
Anyway, I just thought...

690
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,933
Thought you guys should meet.

691
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:01,481
Gentlemen, welcome to our weightless
environmental training facility.

692
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,741
So we're going swimming on
this asteroid. Is that what this is for?

693
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:15,745
Here at downtown NASA,
we call this monster "Armadillo. "

694
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,622
Going to be retrofitted
with your drilling arm.

695
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:20,417
She'll turn 800 turbo horses
in near-zero gravity.

696
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,043
Mind if we take a look at her now?

697
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,587
All these rubber hoses
gotta go, Max. Count 'em up.

698
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,757
Make sure it's short-throw shifters.

699
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:31,302
Quincy! Somebody tell me what this is.

700
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:35,807
Plastic ice cream scoop?
What'd that cost? About $400.

701
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,517
This is about
the sorriest group of people

702
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,520
I've seen in all my entire military career.

703
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,690
Your space flight's gonna be
a brutal assault on your senses.

704
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,525
I'm here to give you a taste of that.

705
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,236
NASA's got some of
the finest pilots in the world.

706
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,114
They're gonna be suckin' your eyes
into the back of your heads.

707
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,160
Go easy on me, okay? It's my first time.

708
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:58,163
I just wanna seriously say
I have a small fear of flying.

709
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,749
I'm gonna twist ya.

710
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,006
- I'm gonna flip ya.
- What's the matter with you?

711
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,801
Frap your body till your bones hurt.

712
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:15,013
When you squeal, I'm just
gonna go faster and harder.

713
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,806
No, take me down!

714
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,645
- How's the rest of the crew?
- Well, uh...

715
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,064
Sorry about the rib chunks
all over your dashboard.

716
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,736
Don't forget: We gotta X-ray all these...

717
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,614
- If you had to say, who would you say?
- I don't know, Oscar.

718
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,574
- Who do you think you are?
- Han Solo.

719
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,826
No, if anybody's anybody, I'm Han.

720
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,828
And you're... You're Chewbacca.

721
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,831
Chewie? Have you
even seen Star Wars?

722
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,417
All right, let's go.

723
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,510
Neil Armstrong, 1969,
bouncing on the moon.

724
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,721
He's bouncing up there because there's
less gravity up there than on Earth.

725
00:41:56,805 --> 00:42:00,350
This will be similar
to the asteroid, so watch it.

726
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,061
Something gets launched off
that asteroid with enough force,

727
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,563
it's gonna keep on going
right into outer space.

728
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,442
What is the deal?
Is it just me, or is Watts really hot?

729
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,194
Yeah.

730
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:15,240
We have these new generation suits
with directional accelerant thrusters.

731
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,325
- You won't bounce like Neil Armstrong.
- Yeah, think so?

732
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,035
- Bear!
- Yes?

733
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,205
- Do we have a problem?
- No.

734
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,414
'Cause I'm trying to describe to you

735
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,251
how these D.A.T. s
keep your ass on the ground.

736
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,794
So that if I were to kick you in the balls...

737
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:28,962
Ooh.

738
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,296
...and you don't know how to work them,

739
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,631
what happens to you?

740
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,050
- I float away.
- Yeah.

741
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:37,220
And when do we start training for that?

742
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,472
Gentlemen, I'll give you 30 seconds
to put your helmets on.

743
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,891
Then the oxygen will be sucked
out of this vacuum,

744
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,769
and you will know what it's like
to be in space. Go!

745
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:49,399
Depressurize in 30 seconds.

746
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,818
Main valves have been activated.

747
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,088
Okay, gentlemen,
so here's the flight plan.

748
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:15,550
Now let's keep the laughter to
a minimum. I know this is not to scale.

749
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:20,179
Both shuttles will take off
Tuesday at 6:30 p. m.

750
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,432
Now 67 minutes later,

751
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,767
you're gonna dock with
the Russian space station

752
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,728
to meet cosmonaut Andropov,

753
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,772
who will refuel the shuttles
with liquid O2.

754
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,609
That's your fuel. Then you'll release

755
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,486
and take a 60-hour trip
toward the moon.

756
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:39,407
Now we only have one shot
of landing on this rock,

757
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:43,202
and that's precisely when
the asteroid passes by the moon.

758
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,623
You'll then use lunar gravity
and burn your thrusters,

759
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,626
slingshotting you around the moon,

760
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,128
coming up behind the asteroid.

761
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:55,465
- You'll be upward of 11 Gs.
- Yeah, I remember this one.

762
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:58,801
It's where the coyote sat
his ass down in a slingshot

763
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,095
and he strapped himself
to an Acme rocket.

764
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,140
- Is... Is that what we're doin' here?
- Rockhound.

765
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:07,060
No, no, really, because it didn't
work out too well for the coyote, Harry.

766
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,606
Actually, we have a lot
better rockets than the coyote.

767
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:17,737
Now when you've finished
your Road Runner thrust move,

768
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:21,449
you'll be moving at
22,500 miles per hour.

769
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,826
Coming around behind the asteroid,

770
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,996
where we're hoping that the tail debris
will be cleared by the moon's gravity.

771
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,248
And you'll land right here. That's it.

772
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,542
We got separate landing sites
for each team.

773
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,795
Softest parts of the rock
as we can figure.

774
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:37,382
At NASA, we don't take chances.
We double up on everything.

775
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:40,343
First team that hits 800 feet wins.

776
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:44,222
Now this rock is big, dense. It's got
some gravity. You can walk around,

777
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:47,100
but use your thrusters
so you can work easier.

778
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:51,145
Okay, Mr. Truman, let's say
that we actually do land on this.

779
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,356
What's it gonna be like up there?

780
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,859
Two hundred degrees in the sunlight.
Minus 200 in the shade.

781
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:01,531
Canyons of razor-sharp rock.
Unpredictable gravitational conditions.

782
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:04,867
Unexpected eruptions. Things like that.

783
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,204
Okay, so the scariest
environment imaginable. Thanks.

784
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:10,331
That's all you gotta say,
scariest environment imaginable.

785
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:14,335
Okay, so you drill,
you drop the nuke and you leave.

786
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,045
Now here's the key.

787
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,756
You're gonna remote detonate the bomb

788
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:23,261
before the asteroid passes
this plane, zero barrier.

789
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,098
You do that,
and the remaining pieces of rock

790
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:30,435
should be deflected enough
to pass right by us.

791
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,104
Now if the bomb explodes
after zero barrier,

792
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,317
game's over.

793
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,736
Apollo, this is Houston,
fire your rockets!

794
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,698
Okay, your rockets are maximum.

795
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:47,744
- Oscar!
- Hey, Harry. Hey, how's it goin'?

796
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,663
- Have you seen Grace?
- Yeah, she's over in the hangar with A.J.

797
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:54,542
Harry, wait a second. Did you say
Grace? Okay, I thought you said Bear.

798
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,581
Will you marry me?

799
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,222
Grace is old enough to vote, Harry.

800
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:52,308
She's old enough to drink or get married
if she wants to, get a divorce.

801
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,518
Let me tell you something, fellas.

802
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,645
When I get back,
when we get this job done,

803
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,313
I will deal with this in my own way.

804
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,649
Come on, Harry. It's not like
I'm rootin' for A.J. here.

805
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,567
I'm just sayin',
Grace is not a little girl anymore.

806
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,528
Hey, Rock. Wait a minute. Let me get
a pencil and a piece of paper.

807
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,822
I wanna jot down
all your pearls of wisdom here.

808
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:09,325
Get serious, Harry. Come on. While
we're off trottin' the globe, hunting mud,

809
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,994
Gracie grew up to become
a full-blown hottie, you know?

810
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,747
- Harry, she is fully hot. She is...
- She's a babe.

811
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,543
Max, okay, you're talkin'
about my little girl, all right?

812
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,920
I think I know
who and what she is, okay?

813
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,255
Harry, all we're sayin' is,

814
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,882
we're talkin' about a kid
who's comin' into her own right now.

815
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,176
She's gettin' curious about her body,

816
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,929
and she's exploring her sexuality.
You know what?

817
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,014
- Oscar.
- That's a natural thing.

818
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,518
You are about five minutes older than
Grace is. Why should I listen to you?

819
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:38,396
I know what it feels like to have
your hormones pullin' you in just

820
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,231
a thousand different directions.

821
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:43,526
No disrespect, man,
but we all helped to raise her.

822
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,361
So, in part, we all feel like

823
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,030
- a bunch of daddies here.
- That's true.

824
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:53,035
I'll be damned if I worked all these years
so my little girl can marry a roughneck.

825
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,874
She's better than that.

826
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,667
Better than all of us.

827
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:11,387
Harry, just sit back, relax. I'm gonna
put on a free Armadillo driving clinic.

828
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,890
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Harry!

829
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,731
Two shuttle teams.

830
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,232
A.J.'ll be running the drill team

831
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,693
with Oscar, Bear and Noonan
on the Independence.

832
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:29,322
I'll run the drill team on Freedom
with Chick, Rockhound and Max.

833
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,074
Once we land, we'll have
eight hours to get the job done.

834
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,076
In order to split this rock
on the fault line,

835
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,537
we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.

836
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:40,374
Let's get our game faces on.
Now it's time for underwater simulation.

837
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,962
Come on. Let's keep it up.
Let's go. We're the younger team here.

838
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:48,424
We're the varsity team.
Take it to 11,000.

839
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,968
Okay, gentlemen, we're gonna trick
'em up. My computer will simulate

840
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:55,973
a gas pocket at 625 feet
and then hard iron ferrite at 635.

841
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:59,685
I'm gonna drill some more.
We're takin' her up.

842
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,605
- I'm givin' it more torque right now.
- All right, lookin' good, Bear.

843
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,232
Clamp it down.
Watch your time, Independence team.

844
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,276
Thanks, Harry. Would you mind
lettin' me run my own team?

845
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,903
You're gonna blow the tranny.

846
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,529
- Slow it down, baby.
- Take it easy, Bear.

847
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,198
Just relax. She can handle it.

848
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,158
A.J., you're at 600 feet.

849
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:17,411
Your pipe is long. Let's back
the R.P.M. s down to 8,000.

850
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:20,289
- We don't have time for 8,000!
- A.J., take it back down.

851
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,667
You're gonna snap the pipe.
I don't wanna blow this transmission.

852
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,961
- Damn it, 11,000.
- Slow it down, A.J.

853
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:28,089
Bear, come on. Get on
our team for a little bit.

854
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,465
Oh, space cowboy.

855
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,968
- Harry, are you listenin' to this?
- Yeah, I'm listenin', Bear.

856
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,011
You don't work for Harry
anymore, okay?

857
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,137
Out there, you gotta listen to me.

858
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,474
When we're on that rock,
you gotta do what I say.

859
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,518
I'm throttling up to 11,000.

860
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:43,270
A.J., back it off.
You're gonna blow the transmission.

861
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,606
Hey, Harry, would you let me
run my team, please?

862
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,899
R.P.M. s are at red line.

863
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,484
Bear, goddamn it,
I know what I'm doing.

864
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:51,237
Come on. She can handle this.
She'll be fine. Trust me.

865
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,615
- A.J., back down.
- The number one transmission is down.

866
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,158
Oh, son of a...

867
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,327
The computer's wrong,
and you know that.

868
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,914
- We did the right thing.
- We're gonna restart the simulation.

869
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,167
If you wanna replace a member
of the crew, now is the time.

870
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,170
I'll take care of this.
Get him out of the tank, Chick.

871
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,426
You wanna go home? Is that it?

872
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,011
- You wanna be fired?
- No, I don't.

873
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,178
My crew was doing the right thing.

874
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,638
- Your crew?
- Yeah.

875
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:20,099
Your crewjust blew
the transmission, A.J.!

876
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,560
Listen, that NASA computer
is just playin' it safe.

877
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:24,270
The machine you built,
the rig, could do it.

878
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,647
Shut up. Just shut up! Shut your mouth!

879
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:30,693
Those men in that room have zero
tolerance for showin' off, hot doggin',

880
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:34,864
goin' by your gut instinct or
you tryin' to be a hero, you got that?

881
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,782
- Say the words, A.J.!
- I got it!

882
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,410
I want my men
to have tomorrow night off.

883
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,494
What do you mean "off"?

884
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,955
I mean, off. Out of here.
For at least ten hours.

885
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,165
Then we'll go to Kennedy.

886
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:46,125
Well, there's no possible way
we can do that, Harry.

887
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,543
There's a potentially huge security risk.

888
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,378
What if they talk? What if they get hurt?

889
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,797
What if they're too burnt out
to do the right thing?

890
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,300
What if they get up there,
and they forget what they're fighting for?

891
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:57,053
You see what's goin' on.
These boys are ready to snap.

892
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,346
They didn't ask to be here.
They got pulled off the street.

893
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,057
For all we know, tomorrow night
could be the last night

894
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,183
they ever see Earth.

895
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:04,226
I don't think it's too much to ask
to let 'em spend it with their families.

896
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,394
Listen, there's no possible
way we can do that.

897
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,021
You got family, Colonel?

898
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:08,105
Two girls.

899
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:11,484
Wouldn't you like to spend tomorrow
with your girls?

900
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,612
I'm not askin' ya. I'm tellin' ya.

901
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,572
Make this happen.

902
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:29,251
This is a pretty big loan.
Why don't you count the cash?

903
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,920
Nah, this looks like 100 grand to me.

904
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:34,715
I'm givin' you this at 60 percent.
I hope you know what you're doin',

905
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,926
because I'll bust your head
with a sledgehammer.

906
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,594
You'll get your money back.

907
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:42,306
You don't look too healthy.
You're not gonna die on me, are ya?

908
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:46,393
Let's just say, no more than you are.
Thanks, Vic.

909
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:57,113
Don't wanna close my eyes

910
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,824
I don't wanna fall asleep

911
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,118
'Cause I'd miss you, baby

912
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,161
And I don't wanna miss a thing

913
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,371
You know what I was thinkin'?

914
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,705
What?

915
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:11,710
I really don't think that the animal
cracker qualifies as a cracker.

916
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,795
Why?

917
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,630
Well, 'cause it's sweet,
which to me suggests cookie.

918
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:16,507
And, you know,

919
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:19,260
putting cheese on something
is sort of the defining characteristic

920
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,720
of what makes a cracker a cracker.

921
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,722
I don't know why I thought of that.
I just...

922
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,058
Baby, you have such sweet pillow talk.

923
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,935
I got a little animal cracker,

924
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,563
Discovery Channel thing
happenin' right here.

925
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:34,900
Watch the gazelle,
as he grazes through the open plains.

926
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:40,114
Now look, as the cheetah approaches.

927
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,658
Watch, as he stalks his prey.

928
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,078
Now, the gazelle's a little spooked,

929
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:50,499
and he could head north
to the ample sustenance

930
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:53,669
provided by
the mountainous peaks above.

931
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,299
He could go south.

932
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:03,762
The gazelle now faces
man's most perilous question:

933
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,515
North...

934
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,018
Or south?

935
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:14,106
Way down under.

936
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:18,736
Tune in next week.

937
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,698
Baby,

938
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:27,786
do you think it's possible
that anyone else in the world

939
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,373
is doing this very same thing
at this very same moment?

940
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,209
I hope so.

941
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:37,171
Otherwise, what the hell
are we tryin' to save?

942
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:45,804
Don't wanna close my eyes

943
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,390
I don't wanna fall asleep

944
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,601
'Cause I'd miss you, baby

945
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,812
And I don't wanna miss a thing

946
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,027
Hey.

947
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,740
What are you doing here?

948
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:08,410
I was just passin' by on the, uh...
I came...

949
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,292
Who's he?

950
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,711
That man's a salesman.

951
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,339
Would you go inside?

952
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,469
Thank you.

953
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,640
He got big.

954
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,104
You can't come around like this.

955
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,815
The court says you can't.

956
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,358
It confuses him.

957
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,360
No, I know. I just...

958
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,988
I wanted to say

959
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,198
that I'm sorry

960
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,742
about everything.

961
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:54,206
I got somethin' comin' up.
It's somethin' kinda big.

962
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,127
You just might be proud of me.

963
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,005
Would you do somethin' for me?
Would you just give him this?

964
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:05,009
You don't have to... You don't
have to tell him who it's from. Just...

965
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,644
Everybody talkin' about
what it is, what it ain't

966
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,855
Kiss on the devil
and you piss off a saint

967
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,524
But it can't be love
if you don't have to crawl

968
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:23,694
You say you only love him
but you got to have it all

969
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,990
Hey, Noonan, you need ten grand?

970
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,658
We gotta put these girls
through college.

971
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,994
I love this astronaut stuff.

972
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,746
Good work, if you can get it.

973
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,498
Yeah, I'm just in town
doin' a little astronaut training.

974
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,251
Ooh! Astronauta.

975
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,795
Ah, si. I'm a mission specialist.

976
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:44,256
Yes, and what's that mean?

977
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,050
I don't know.

978
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:51,472
Hey! Who the hell
do you think you guys are?

979
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:52,848
You're hoggin' all the action.

980
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:56,185
Hey, pinhead.
Why don't you go find your own party?

981
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,686
Why don't you spread the wealth, pal?

982
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,438
Here. Why don't
you go buy yourself a neck?

983
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,065
Hey, Mr. Clean!

984
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:07,863
Call NASA! They'll confirm it!
We're astronauts!

985
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,073
Get over there. Yeah, yeah.

986
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,283
- Yeah, we're astronauts!
- Yeah, we're all astronauts.

987
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,411
You are so messing
with national security right now, man.

988
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,914
You are fired tomorrow morning.
I'm telling ya.

989
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,041
I'll get the C.I.A. and the F.B.I.

990
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,959
You'll be workin' security at Toys 'R' Us.

991
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,045
- Oh, oh, baby, no, no. No, no!
- Bye-bye, little astronaut.

992
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,546
Oh, don't leave, baby. No, no, no.

993
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,632
See, I'm goin' into space,
and I'm not comin' back.

994
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,138
It's coming in at 30,000 miles an hour!

995
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,182
Give me a projected impact.

996
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,725
East Asia, 11 minutes.

997
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:40,145
- We're gonna have to warn...
- Warn who? The entire South Pacific?

998
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:35,784
So the whole world knows.

999
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,873
Tell me you've never let
anybody down before.

1000
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,750
I never quit yet. How's that?

1001
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,545
I guess that'll have to do.

1002
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,548
You know somethin'?

1003
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:52,926
I still remember the first,
middle and last name

1004
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,304
of every guy that qualified
for the astronaut program

1005
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,598
first year I was here. Thanks.

1006
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,559
I went into the engineering program.

1007
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,311
Kinda had to.

1008
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,563
But boy, I wanted to go up there.

1009
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:08,650
I wanted to be one of those guys
with a mission patch on my arm.

1010
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,279
I tell you, I'd be on that shuttle
with you, Harry, if I could.

1011
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:20,746
You don't want to be up
in that shuttle any more than I do.

1012
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,749
Good luck in Florida tomorrow.

1013
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,626
The death of 50,000 people

1014
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,003
in Shanghai yesterday has rattled...

1015
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,338
A French satellite has tracked

1016
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,298
an object in space...

1017
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:32,508
Sources are estimating

1018
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,092
that the tidal wave was five...

1019
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,969
This is CNN, live in Florida.

1020
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:39,598
We have just learned that NASA
is on a full-scale military alert.

1021
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:42,226
They're calling this a global killer.

1022
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,310
The government has been

1023
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:44,394
very tight-lipped throughout this...

1024
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:45,562
The Pentagon is getting involved

1025
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,397
at this point with some kind of a project

1026
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:50,359
involving NASA
and perhaps a shuttle mission...

1027
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,736
Senior Pentagon officials
refused comment,

1028
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,112
adding fuel to the speculation

1029
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:57,199
that there could be
a very serious problem.

1030
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:59,034
We have a special team of astronauts

1031
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,078
that arrived in Florida this evening.

1032
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:03,413
NASA's in emergency
launch preparation

1033
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,541
in cooperation with Russian, Japanese

1034
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:06,708
and French space agencies

1035
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:10,128
on the most massive joint
space venture in history.

1036
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:19,638
Gracie?

1037
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,691
Got your note.

1038
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,068
What're you doin' out here, honey?

1039
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,153
Um, just thinkin'.

1040
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:39,491
- Yeah.
- I, um, want to apologize to you for...

1041
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,744
Oh, no, Grace, stop.
You don't have to apologize at all.

1042
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,037
I... I...

1043
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,542
I shouldn't have dragged you
around on all those oil rigs.

1044
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:49,876
I just...

1045
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,630
I don't think that I did
the right thing with you.

1046
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,592
You're wrong. I love my life.

1047
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,803
I love everything about my life.

1048
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:02,848
And I don't blame you
for my mother leaving.

1049
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,935
She left us both.

1050
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,355
And I love you.

1051
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,609
And don't talk
like you're not comin' back.

1052
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,362
Promise me that you'll come back.

1053
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:19,823
Okay.

1054
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,658
Say, "I promise. "

1055
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:25,037
I promise, Grace.

1056
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,376
It's gonna be all right, Grace.

1057
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:37,924
If it's not too much trouble,

1058
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,385
can you please
bring my fiancée home with you?

1059
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,220
Oh, Jesus.

1060
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,567
The president will be addressing
the nation and all of you personally

1061
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,902
within the hour.

1062
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,098
Astronauts.

1063
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,857
I'll see you in a couple days, honey.

1064
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,908
All my bags are packed

1065
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,785
I'm ready to go

1066
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,913
I'm standin' here outside your door

1067
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,543
I hate to wake you up

1068
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:57,796
To say good-bye

1069
01:01:58,172 --> 01:02:02,175
So kiss me and smile for me

1070
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:05,637
Let me know you'll wait for me

1071
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:09,933
Hold me like you'll never let me go

1072
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,478
'Cause I'm leavin'

1073
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:16,022
On a jet plane

1074
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:18,984
Don't know when I'll be back again

1075
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:23,321
Leavin' on a jet plane

1076
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:26,700
I don't know when I'll be back again

1077
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:30,579
Leavin' on a jet plane

1078
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:33,915
I don't know when I'll be back again

1079
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,208
Leavin' on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again

1080
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:39,337
So, Truman, this is who you found
to save the planet.

1081
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,757
- Frost, you good to go?
- Mm-hmm. One... One sec.

1082
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:42,883
Leavin' on a jet plane

1083
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,885
That boy don't take anything seriously.

1084
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:47,888
Yeah. Reminds me of a guy
I used to know.

1085
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,225
Leavin' on a jet plane

1086
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,769
I don't know when I'll be back again

1087
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,228
I'm marrying you.

1088
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,313
Bet your ass you are.

1089
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:59,024
Leavin' on a jet plane

1090
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,985
I don't know when I'll be back again

1091
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,586
I address you tonight,

1092
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:23,298
not as the President
of the United States,

1093
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:27,135
not as the leader of a country,

1094
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,805
but as a citizen of humanity.

1095
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:36,061
WE are faced
with the very gravest of challenges.

1096
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:42,776
The Bible calls this day
Armageddon, the end of all things.

1097
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:47,364
And yet, for the first time,

1098
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,991
in the history of the planet,

1099
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:53,161
a species has the technology

1100
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,497
to prevent its own extinction.

1101
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,793
All of you praying with us need to know

1102
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:05,423
that everything that can be done
to prevent this disaster

1103
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,926
is being called into service.

1104
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:13,807
The human thirst for excellence,

1105
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,393
knowledge,

1106
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:20,605
every step up the ladder of science,

1107
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:26,111
every adventurous reach into space,

1108
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:30,198
all of our combined
modern technologies and imaginations,

1109
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:34,202
even the wars that we've fought,
have provided us the tools...

1110
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,454
to wage this terrible battle.

1111
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,666
Through all the chaos
that is our history,

1112
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,712
through all of the wrongs
and the discord,

1113
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,755
through all of the pain and suffering,

1114
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,883
through all of our times,

1115
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:50,218
there is one thing
that has nourished our souls...

1116
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,888
Mom, that salesman's on TV.

1117
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:56,099
...and elevated our species
above its origins,

1118
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:58,184
and that is our courage.

1119
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:01,897
Dreams of an entire planet
are focused tonight

1120
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,649
on those 14 brave souls

1121
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,527
traveling into the heavens.

1122
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:09,905
That man's not a salesman.

1123
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,239
That's your daddy.

1124
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:12,407
And may we all,

1125
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:15,994
citizens the world over,
see these events through.

1126
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:20,373
Godspeed and good luck to you.

1127
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,216
Freedom crew. Independence crew.

1128
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,932
How ya feelin'?

1129
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:40,518
Uh, good, you know.
I mean, considering I've never been

1130
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:43,438
this scared in my entire life.
I... You know...

1131
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:47,192
Listen. Once you get up there,
you're gonna be on your own.

1132
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,818
If anything should happen,
I just wanted to...

1133
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:52,530
I know, Harry.
I'll, uh, try not to disappoint you.

1134
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:58,870
Take care of yourself, kid.

1135
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:06,044
Freedom's on the bridge.

1136
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:09,881
Attention in the firing room.
Oxidizer loading is complete.

1137
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:12,634
Independence on the bridge.

1138
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,511
Attention all personnel.

1139
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:17,555
We are T minus two hours
to the program goal.

1140
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,525
- Hey, Harry.
- Yeah, Rock?

1141
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:31,903
You know, we're sittin' on four million
pounds of fuel, one nuclear weapon

1142
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,990
and a thing that has
270,000 moving parts

1143
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:36,658
built by the lowest bidder.

1144
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:40,286
Makes you feel good, doesn't it?

1145
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:41,496
Yeah.

1146
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:46,084
- How ya doin', Oscar?
- Great.

1147
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,920
I got that excited, scared feelin',

1148
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,881
like 98 percent excited,
2 percent scared.

1149
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:54,009
Maybe more. It could be 2...

1150
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:56,052
It could be 98 percent scared,
2 percent excited.

1151
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:59,806
But that's what makes it so intense,
is it's so confused.

1152
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,850
I can't really figure it out.

1153
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:04,519
Will you make mine really tight,
'cause I don't want to fall out?

1154
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:07,105
I mean, almost to the point
of cutting off circulation.

1155
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:13,111
It must be a comfort to know
that if the space program goes under,

1156
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,113
you can always get a job
at Helga's House of Pain, huh?

1157
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:18,033
All right. Flight directors
on with the go/no-go for launch.

1158
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,325
- Retro.
- Go flight.

1159
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:20,702
- Booster.
- Go flight.

1160
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:21,745
- Ecos.
- Go flight.

1161
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:23,204
- Trajectory.
- Go flight.

1162
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,622
- FIDO.
- Go flight.

1163
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:25,790
- EVA.
- Go flight.

1164
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,375
- CAPCOM Freedom.
- Go flight.

1165
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,794
- CAPCOM Independence.
- Go flight.

1166
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:33,006
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
it's pucker time.

1167
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:35,550
Independence and Freedom,
this is Kennedy firing room.

1168
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:37,302
We're T minus one minute.

1169
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:40,305
All crew members,
close and lock your visors.

1170
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:45,101
Independence, this is launch control.
Be advised, we're in a smooth count.

1171
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:48,396
T minus 31.
You're go for auto-sequence start.

1172
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:51,066
P.L.T.s, perform your A.P.U. pre-start.

1173
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:54,194
Okay, gentlemen,
you're our warriors up there.

1174
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:56,488
God be with you.

1175
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:59,240
You're already heroes.
Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

1176
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:02,869
We're T minus 20 seconds.

1177
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:09,501
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven.

1178
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:13,755
Four. Three. Two. One.

1179
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:18,343
We have main engine start.

1180
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:21,179
- We have booster ignition.
- We're going.

1181
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:23,431
And liftoff.

1182
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,485
Freedom, this is flight deck.

1183
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:40,240
Roger, Freedom. You're looking good.

1184
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,670
We have go for Independence.

1185
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:56,214
Three. Two. One.

1186
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:58,383
Independence,
we have booster ignition.

1187
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:01,261
We have liftoff.

1188
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:02,971
We are cooking, Houston.

1189
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:27,537
Houston, the tower is clear.
They're all yours.

1190
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:32,500
Heads up, everybody. They're ours now.

1191
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:33,835
All engines are go.

1192
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:35,920
Keep a sharp eye out on both of 'em.

1193
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:45,597
Start roll maneuver.

1194
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:57,066
Two good roll programs.

1195
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:58,943
- One down.
- Independence, we have max cue.

1196
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,613
Roger, Control. We are a max cue.

1197
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:04,199
S.R.B. sep...

1198
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:11,497
We are single-engine, press, demi-go.

1199
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:13,208
Copy, press, demi-go.

1200
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:15,668
Houston, this is a kick-ass ride!

1201
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,385
Freedom, this is Houston.
Main engine cut out on schedule. Out.

1202
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:36,439
Freedom, stats are good.

1203
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:42,904
Independence,
telemetry is up and running.

1204
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:44,113
Oh, my God.

1205
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:48,076
This is space! Course, we're just
in the beginning part of space.

1206
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,578
We... We haven't gotten
to outer space yet.

1207
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:52,872
Roger, Houston. We have a visual
on the Russian space station.

1208
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:54,832
Initiating retro burn.

1209
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,586
Gentlemen, remember
the Russian space station

1210
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,296
has been up there for 11 years.

1211
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,257
Most of us don't have cars that old.

1212
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,299
Now, the cosmonaut on board

1213
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:06,511
has been on that tin can
for 18 months, alone.

1214
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:11,975
So don't be surprised if he's a little... off.

1215
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:13,351
Independence, we're gonna put you...

1216
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,270
All right, crew.
Let's exit these flight suits.

1217
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,940
Hello.

1218
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:22,568
This is Russian space station.
Can you hear me?

1219
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:25,947
We copy, Russian space station.
This is Houston.

1220
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:29,534
I'm ready to fire my thrusters any time.

1221
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:33,037
- Stand by.
- Okay. I'm not going anywhere.

1222
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,790
We have a go.
Initiate gravitational spin.

1223
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,425
You are maxed at 40-percent spin.

1224
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,887
Okay, Houston.

1225
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:54,892
I can feel I'm having gravity.

1226
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:58,313
All right, gentlemen.
We're gonna dock in a minute.

1227
01:11:58,397 --> 01:11:59,480
Now, the Russian space station

1228
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:00,940
- has fired her rockets...
- Whee!

1229
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:03,109
...to simulate gravity
and let us work faster.

1230
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:05,153
It's gonna make you queasy,
so prepare yourself.

1231
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:07,739
Well, it's about time.
I haven't thrown up in about an hour.

1232
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:15,788
Initiating first phase
of docking procedure.

1233
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,750
- Switching to manual.
- Manual override.

1234
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:28,343
One foot per second. Let's take this
slow and do it right, folks.

1235
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:29,844
Twenty feet.

1236
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:33,765
Ten feet.

1237
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:35,808
Looking good on radar.

1238
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,394
Five feet.

1239
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:45,026
Locks are engaged. Fuel teams, let's go.

1240
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:48,988
Freedom, telemetry is looking good.

1241
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,991
We have soft dock.

1242
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:54,535
Fuel teams, prepare to unload.

1243
01:12:58,832 --> 01:13:00,541
All right, gentlemen, watch your heads.

1244
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:02,543
Let's go, Independence.

1245
01:13:06,006 --> 01:13:07,340
Colonel.

1246
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:20,353
Where is he? Anybody home?

1247
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:23,272
Welcome, everybody!

1248
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:27,652
I am not gas station.

1249
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:31,030
This is sophisticated laboratory.
I'm in charge.

1250
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:33,741
So do not be touching anything.

1251
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:36,744
- I need one... I need you.
- Go with him.

1252
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:39,455
I need you. Hurry up. Hurry up.
Come on. Come on.

1253
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,667
It's very important
you watch the fuel gauge, okay?

1254
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,210
Put on cold suit.

1255
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:45,795
- Countdown clock will hold at...
- Copy that, Houston.

1256
01:13:45,879 --> 01:13:47,130
Prepping for fuel transfer.

1257
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:49,507
Countdown clock will hold
at T minus 20 minutes and...

1258
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,926
Fuel pod is down there.

1259
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,928
It's down here, huh? Great.

1260
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:07,567
Okay, let's connect these fuel lines.

1261
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:12,697
Freedom on the left,
Independence on the right.

1262
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:15,241
All right. We're goin' left here.

1263
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:19,954
To the right is fuel gauge.
You watch the fuel gauge.

1264
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:22,373
One fifty, okay. One sixty, okay.

1265
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:26,085
Two hundred,
bad disaster for space station.

1266
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:32,091
So if you watch 200, you call for Lev,
on, and you see here number one. Off.

1267
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:34,802
You ask for Lev. And you pull
this down, all the way down.

1268
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,179
What's Lev?

1269
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:39,640
I am Lev Andropov,
colonel of Russian space agency.

1270
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,893
In Russia I'm a very big man.

1271
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,812
We're ready to transfer.

1272
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:46,772
I'm coming. No problem.

1273
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:51,903
You. You. You there!

1274
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:55,364
- Hard locked.
- Ready for transfusion!

1275
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:06,042
Fuel is pumping.

1276
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:12,465
Hey, Lev, the, uh...
The... The pressure's climbing.

1277
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,511
Still, we're on fuel transference.

1278
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:19,180
Don't touch my uncle. You know?

1279
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:20,890
He's a genius of my family.

1280
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,895
Lev! Can anybody hear me?
Guys? Hello, guys!

1281
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:28,523
He used to work for a big bomb factory.

1282
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:30,525
He used to make the tip of the bomb,

1283
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:34,862
the thing that finds, uh, New York
or Washington, you know?

1284
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:36,489
Ooh.

1285
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:38,908
Check your hoses.
We got some thermal variation.

1286
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:41,911
Stamper, let's look at the couplings,
back on the shuttle.

1287
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:46,123
Okay. Shut down. Uh...

1288
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:54,882
Uh... Guys!

1289
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,969
What's that noise?

1290
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:01,305
Oh, no! God!

1291
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:05,851
What is it?

1292
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:08,854
Leak! Leak!

1293
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:13,317
Get your men back to the shuttle! Go!

1294
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:17,572
Go! Hurry up! Get out of there!

1295
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:20,032
You know, this really smarts!

1296
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:22,034
Pull lever!

1297
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,786
This is the lever!

1298
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,080
Colonel, we must get him out of there!

1299
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:28,499
A.J., come on out!

1300
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,212
Hurry! Hurry!

1301
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:37,675
Emergency break away!

1302
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,553
We got a fire in the fuel pod!

1303
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,099
- Come on!
- Come on!

1304
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:47,852
Get in here! A.J.'s stuck in the fuel pod!

1305
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:50,980
We're losing it!

1306
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:07,204
Control, this is Independence.
I am seeing vibration...

1307
01:17:08,915 --> 01:17:09,915
Malloy, talk to me!

1308
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,959
Not good.
We got sparks and fire in the fuel pod.

1309
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:14,378
Independence, blow those locks
and get outta there now!

1310
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:15,838
Dump the hoses now! We're going!

1311
01:17:15,922 --> 01:17:18,215
What happened?
Let me shut off the O2 feed!

1312
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,051
Harry, it's burnin' up!

1313
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:22,637
Damn! Max, Rock, get in here!

1314
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,930
Get down there
and crack these pipes over here!

1315
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:26,390
Harry, it's burnin' up!

1316
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,267
We're goin' back for the other team!

1317
01:17:29,394 --> 01:17:32,063
Switch on
the personnel locators.

1318
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:34,440
Trackin' A.J. He's climbin'.

1319
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:36,400
- No!
- Go! Go!

1320
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:40,905
It's too late! Get back to the shuttle!
This thing's gonna blow!

1321
01:17:41,406 --> 01:17:42,448
No!

1322
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:46,827
Colonel, we gotta move now!
Come on! Close the hatch!

1323
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,122
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
We got a man in there!

1324
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:53,167
- Open that door, and we'll all die!
- Fuel leak!

1325
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:58,839
Evac now! Let's go! Let's go!

1326
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:04,595
Come on back! No, wait!
The door is broken!

1327
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:07,098
No!

1328
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:08,849
They got the fire sealed in the fuel pod.

1329
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:09,892
They locked it down.

1330
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:11,060
Tracking men to the shuttle.

1331
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:12,812
They've still got
two men trapped in there!

1332
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,650
Keep running!
The shuttle's another 75 feet!

1333
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,110
Where's the rest of the team?

1334
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:21,362
Where's A.J.?

1335
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:23,739
- A.J.'s gone!
- We're not leavin' without A.J.!

1336
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:26,033
He's gone! It's too late!

1337
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:30,454
Come on! This way is our only chance!

1338
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:32,748
So it's minus hundred!

1339
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:35,960
Very cold. Hold breath, or lung freezes!

1340
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:45,803
Get back to the shuttle!
And lock that door!

1341
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,227
It's on fire! It's on fire, Harry!

1342
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:55,938
- It's them or all of us!
- It's on fire.

1343
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:58,190
- Full thrust.
- We're gonna get hit.

1344
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:18,419
Lev! Lev, the door's gonna blow!

1345
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:20,629
No!

1346
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:27,094
We're going! It's gonna blow!

1347
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:29,638
A.J.'s still in there!

1348
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:32,224
Blow the locks. No, the bolts!

1349
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:33,809
We've gotta...

1350
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:36,061
I think we're almost there!

1351
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,440
Flight, Independence does not have A.J.

1352
01:19:39,524 --> 01:19:40,649
They're gonna close the door
without him.

1353
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:42,234
Tracking.
They're 75 feet from the shuttle.

1354
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:43,944
Just tell 'em to air lock the door and go!

1355
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:45,362
Dog the hatch now!

1356
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:46,447
Close it!

1357
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:52,995
Ho...

1358
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,709
Colonel! That thing's comin' right for...
We got to move!

1359
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:04,131
Hurry up! There's the shuttle door!

1360
01:20:06,718 --> 01:20:09,512
Fire's coming at us! Close the door now!

1361
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:15,976
Go! Go! Go!

1362
01:20:24,277 --> 01:20:28,072
Freedom, the Independence crew
is on board and accounted for.

1363
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,825
We're even heavy one cosmonaut.

1364
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:32,743
They got 90 percent of their fuel.

1365
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:34,995
Pretty intense, huh?

1366
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:40,251
That's why I told you, "Touch nothing. "
But you're bunch of cowboys.

1367
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:47,383
So while the consciousness
of the planet is unified,

1368
01:20:47,467 --> 01:20:48,759
focused on the NASA mission

1369
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,095
taking place right now
in the vast ocean of space,

1370
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:54,098
we're now in the final hours
of the mission,

1371
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:57,518
as the Freedom and Independence
prepare to slingshot around the moon.

1372
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:09,280
Morning, guys.
It's time to suit up, I guess.

1373
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,448
Uh, we got a big day.

1374
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:13,993
Eighteen seconds to radio interrupt.

1375
01:21:14,077 --> 01:21:15,703
Booster sequence confirmed.

1376
01:21:15,787 --> 01:21:18,789
This is Houston.
Roger that, Freedom. We copy

1377
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,833
Shuttles are ready
for the burn around the moon.

1378
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:23,460
Radio contact terminated. We're out.

1379
01:21:24,754 --> 01:21:28,966
Nine and a half Gs for 11 minutes.
I'd start praying about right now.

1380
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:35,890
So this is the part
where we're supposed to just

1381
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:38,392
hold on real tight and, uh,
hope we don't die.

1382
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:40,477
Stand by for lunar roll.

1383
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:42,271
High inclination. Lunar orbit.

1384
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:47,776
You boys got those wills
filled out correctly?

1385
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:04,919
All right, men,
this is what we trained for.

1386
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,253
Nowjust suck it up!

1387
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:09,381
On the mark. Five. Four.

1388
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:11,842
Three. Two. One.

1389
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:23,646
Is this supposed to be like this?

1390
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:25,147
Don't worry. This is normal.

1391
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:26,273
How would you know?

1392
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:29,360
- Fourteen thousand miles an hour.
- Four Gs.

1393
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,445
- Ahh!
- How long does this last?

1394
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:32,571
Six Gs.

1395
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:36,659
Fifteen thousand.

1396
01:22:36,743 --> 01:22:38,744
- Really heavy, man!
- This isn't normal.

1397
01:22:38,828 --> 01:22:40,120
What do you mean, "this isn't normal"?

1398
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:41,872
This is way worse!

1399
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,707
Eight Gs. Hang tight!

1400
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:47,795
We're not gonna make it!
Oh, we're gonna die!

1401
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:50,589
Twelve minutes.
Flight, we still got nothin' here.

1402
01:22:52,425 --> 01:22:54,760
This is too fast!

1403
01:22:58,765 --> 01:22:59,765
Ten Gs!

1404
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:16,573
We're maxed at 22,500!

1405
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:29,420
We have acquisition of signal
from Independence and Freedom.

1406
01:23:30,588 --> 01:23:33,340
We're in, guys.
All right. Welcome back, team.

1407
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,176
We have visual of the target, Houston.

1408
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:46,729
You see that?

1409
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:52,526
Wow.

1410
01:23:55,655 --> 01:23:57,156
Come in, Independence.

1411
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,451
Houston, you gotta see this
to believe it.

1412
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:03,746
Okay, team, let's take 'em in.

1413
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:05,622
Okay, Quincy, how much tail debris
do we have?

1414
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:07,875
Freedom, turn on FOD radar.

1415
01:24:07,959 --> 01:24:09,043
FOD radar on.

1416
01:24:11,671 --> 01:24:13,881
Everybody, hang on.
This could get a little rough.

1417
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:15,883
Engaging evasive radar.

1418
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:24,725
Hold on!

1419
01:24:36,112 --> 01:24:37,988
Goddamn! We got debris!

1420
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:42,701
We're dumping auxiliary boosters.

1421
01:24:55,715 --> 01:24:58,509
- Houston, do you read me?
- We got debris!

1422
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:03,555
We're goin' in! We're comin' in hot!

1423
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:08,852
Independence, try to maintain
your present heading.

1424
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,020
You've got a target L.Z.

1425
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:12,314
There's too much debris!
We gotta peel off!

1426
01:25:12,398 --> 01:25:13,690
Negative!

1427
01:25:16,986 --> 01:25:18,320
We're hit!

1428
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:21,990
Mayday, mayday!

1429
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:23,951
I've lost main thrusters.
Get 'em back up!

1430
01:25:24,035 --> 01:25:26,370
Mayday, Houston, mayday!
We've lost R.C.S. thrusters!

1431
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:28,163
Mayday, Freedom, mayday!

1432
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:30,415
We are out of control!
We are going down!

1433
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,751
Do you read me?
Freedom, we are going down!

1434
01:25:46,182 --> 01:25:47,141
We're gonna hit!

1435
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:02,072
Everybody, go to your own life support!
Lock yourself in the cargo bay!

1436
01:26:03,950 --> 01:26:05,325
We are going down!

1437
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:09,121
Houston! Houston, we are going down!
We have lost control!

1438
01:26:09,205 --> 01:26:10,873
I can't get it on!

1439
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:14,626
Good luck, Freedom.

1440
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:16,712
Oh, my God, this is it.

1441
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:10,641
Sharp, what the hell is that?
Is that the Independence?

1442
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,564
Houston, Independence
is a dead stick.

1443
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,900
They're not gonna make it.

1444
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:34,206
Houston,
Independence has gone down.

1445
01:27:46,302 --> 01:27:48,637
When I touch this baby down,
full reverse thrust.

1446
01:27:48,721 --> 01:27:50,722
- Fires on your right, Sharp!
- Reversing the thrusters!

1447
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:54,851
Hang tight! Hang tight!

1448
01:27:55,853 --> 01:27:59,231
Houston, we overshot our landing field.
We overshot our landing field.

1449
01:27:59,315 --> 01:28:01,233
Oh, no!

1450
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:22,838
God!

1451
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:42,733
Initiate system light system check.
Make sure we can still get off this rock.

1452
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:45,277
Our electrical system is screwed.
I'm going to back-up.

1453
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:47,154
Fuel seals check. Engine seals check.

1454
01:28:47,238 --> 01:28:50,073
- Oh, God. Oh!
- Pressure seals check.

1455
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:54,411
Anyone hurt?

1456
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:56,913
Where's...

1457
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:02,127
Where's the other shuttle?
What happened to the other shuttle?

1458
01:29:02,211 --> 01:29:04,421
Independence is off the grid.

1459
01:29:04,714 --> 01:29:05,714
"Off the grid"?

1460
01:29:05,798 --> 01:29:09,009
What are you, a freakin' cyborg?
What does that mean?

1461
01:29:09,093 --> 01:29:11,470
Hey, you saw it yourself, right?

1462
01:29:11,804 --> 01:29:13,263
They're gone.

1463
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:18,185
Come in, Freedom. This is
CAPCOM Houston. Freedom, come in.

1464
01:29:18,269 --> 01:29:21,104
This is CAPCOM Houston.
Come in, Freedom.

1465
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:23,857
- God!
- Let's just ask God

1466
01:29:23,941 --> 01:29:25,901
to take care of our friends.

1467
01:29:27,737 --> 01:29:29,613
May they rest in peace.

1468
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:32,115
Amen.

1469
01:29:40,249 --> 01:29:41,958
We got eight hours.

1470
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:46,088
Let's get this job done and go home.

1471
01:29:46,547 --> 01:29:47,547
Nothin'.

1472
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:50,008
Come on, Watts, Sharp, somebody.

1473
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:52,469
This is CAPCOM Houston.

1474
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:57,766
Come in, Freedom. Freedom, come in.
This is CAPCOM Houston.

1475
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:01,812
Maybe you shouldn't be here.

1476
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:04,231
I don't have anywhere else to go.

1477
01:30:04,315 --> 01:30:06,149
Freedom, come in.
This is CAPCOM Houston.

1478
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:11,029
All right, let's get the tools unpacked
and fire up the Armadillo.

1479
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:13,323
We're not getting a damn thing
on the inertial nav system.

1480
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,909
- I know where we are.
- Please step away.

1481
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:17,327
Radio signal's dead.

1482
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:19,079
I'm flipping the backup generator.

1483
01:30:19,163 --> 01:30:21,665
Radio signal's gonna be cut in half
till we get main power back.

1484
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:27,254
We're in segment 202, lateral grid 9,
site 15H-32, give or take a few yards.

1485
01:30:27,338 --> 01:30:30,924
Captain America here
blew the landing by 26 miles.

1486
01:30:31,008 --> 01:30:33,260
How the hell do you know that?

1487
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,095
Because I'm a genius.

1488
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:36,179
The gauges will not read.

1489
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,640
They're all peaked, like we're plugged
into some magnetic field.

1490
01:30:38,724 --> 01:30:40,517
Well, who on this spaceship
wants to know why?

1491
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:43,061
- By all means.
- The reason we were shooting for grid 8

1492
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:47,816
is because thermographics indicated
that grid 9 was compressed iron ferrite.

1493
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:52,529
Which means that you landed us
on a goddamn iron plate.

1494
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,158
All right. Well, you heard the man.

1495
01:30:56,242 --> 01:30:58,160
Let's wheel out the remote satellite link.
We need that radio.

1496
01:30:58,244 --> 01:30:59,870
Oh, God, please tell me
we still got one of 'em.

1497
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:04,624
Independence has flat-lined.

1498
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:51,922
Oscar! Oscar!

1499
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:56,092
Oh, God!

1500
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:03,099
Hello! Anyone! Is anyone else alive?

1501
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:05,977
Somebody, help me!

1502
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:09,189
A.J.!

1503
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:12,317
Where are you?

1504
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:13,735
I'm here.

1505
01:32:18,324 --> 01:32:20,534
Lev, there's no one else.

1506
01:32:21,494 --> 01:32:22,827
There's no one else.

1507
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,246
I know.

1508
01:32:24,497 --> 01:32:26,206
Oh, man.

1509
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:29,834
Bear, where are you?
A.J.? A.J.?

1510
01:32:31,671 --> 01:32:33,755
I'm in the shuttle, man.

1511
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:36,633
Are you all right?

1512
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:39,135
I'm so glad to see you, man.

1513
01:32:39,428 --> 01:32:42,472
I never thought I'd be so happy
to see your ugly face.

1514
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:45,141
Houston, do you read? This is Freedom.

1515
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:46,518
Check your thrusters.

1516
01:32:46,602 --> 01:32:48,311
Houston, do you copy?

1517
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:49,980
Is everyone good to go?

1518
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:02,158
Wow.

1519
01:33:12,795 --> 01:33:15,213
Down here! In the valley!

1520
01:33:16,173 --> 01:33:19,175
This place is like
Dr. Seuss's worst nightmare.

1521
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:22,721
Let's get the remote satellite.
We'll get better reception up there.

1522
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:25,599
Bring Max down.

1523
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:29,060
Watch yourself through here, Max.
There're a couple big fissures.

1524
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:30,395
To the left!

1525
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:32,439
Bring it to the left!

1526
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:39,029
Rockhound,
you come on down here

1527
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:41,698
and take some readings
down in the flat spot.

1528
01:33:44,076 --> 01:33:45,619
Iron ferrite.

1529
01:33:48,748 --> 01:33:50,248
I have fire.

1530
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:53,126
Watts, I'm comin' back.
Stand by.

1531
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:55,086
Mostly iron, Rockhound.

1532
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:57,255
God, I hate knowing everything.

1533
01:33:57,340 --> 01:34:00,050
We couldn't have picked
a worse spot to drill.

1534
01:34:00,134 --> 01:34:04,220
Well, I can pretty much guarantee
it's not gonna be thicker than 50 feet.

1535
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:07,432
- How do you figure that?
- 'Cause if it is, we're screwed.

1536
01:34:09,477 --> 01:34:12,145
- Max, you good?
- Yeah. Just makin' hole.

1537
01:34:12,229 --> 01:34:13,605
Turn it around.

1538
01:34:13,689 --> 01:34:15,774
Friggin' outer space.

1539
01:34:18,235 --> 01:34:19,611
It's good.

1540
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:30,288
All right. We're in. Another light.
We're cuttin' through pretty good.

1541
01:34:30,373 --> 01:34:33,458
There's some stuff in here
I ain't never seen.

1542
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:35,710
All right, let's punch it down!

1543
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:40,173
- Hey, Harry, did you see that?
- Yeah, Max, I see it. I see it. What is it?

1544
01:34:40,257 --> 01:34:41,508
We lost the bite in the bit.

1545
01:34:41,592 --> 01:34:43,843
All right. Back it off. Back it off.

1546
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:45,303
Goddamn it!

1547
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:47,555
Sounds like we twisted a shank.
Back it out of there, Max.

1548
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,766
Good. Good. Hold 'er there.

1549
01:34:54,063 --> 01:34:57,023
Wow, this is a goddamn Greek tragedy.

1550
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:59,526
We've all seen
broken drill heads before.

1551
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:01,361
Not after ten feet.

1552
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:04,197
- I never seen one.
- Well, now you've seen one.

1553
01:35:04,281 --> 01:35:06,783
- What do you want?
- Unpack the Judge.

1554
01:35:09,286 --> 01:35:10,912
Bear, Lev.

1555
01:35:11,789 --> 01:35:14,916
We're only
three astronauts left now.

1556
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:17,210
We're not astronauts.
We're oil drillers.

1557
01:35:17,294 --> 01:35:19,295
We're not even supposed to be here.

1558
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,464
What? You're not astronaut?

1559
01:35:22,007 --> 01:35:24,801
- I'm getting us outta here. Get in.
- Why?

1560
01:35:24,885 --> 01:35:27,262
Just get in the Armadillo. I have an idea.

1561
01:35:27,346 --> 01:35:29,431
Houston, this is Freedom. Do you copy?

1562
01:35:29,515 --> 01:35:32,058
Houston, do you copy?
Freedom shuttle has...

1563
01:35:33,853 --> 01:35:36,521
We're gettin'
some scattered video feeds here.

1564
01:35:36,605 --> 01:35:38,732
Houston, this is Freedom.
Do you copy?

1565
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:41,401
- Thank God we have you, Freedom.
- Freedom, this is Houston. Go ahead.

1566
01:35:41,485 --> 01:35:43,987
- Don't lose 'em, Malloy.
- Sharp, I'm getting something.

1567
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:45,071
Houston, this is Freedom.

1568
01:35:45,156 --> 01:35:46,948
- We have landed safely.
- Where are they?

1569
01:35:47,032 --> 01:35:49,743
We are at site coordinates
approximately 15H-32...

1570
01:35:49,827 --> 01:35:51,578
Okay, I want to know everything
we can about that location.

1571
01:35:51,662 --> 01:35:52,829
- Got it.
- Get it before we lose 'em.

1572
01:35:52,913 --> 01:35:55,081
We're also having electric
and antenna difficulties.

1573
01:35:55,166 --> 01:35:56,416
Walter, get Mechanical on that.

1574
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,460
But we have commenced drilling.

1575
01:35:58,544 --> 01:36:00,462
Stevens, we're losin' him.
Bring it up on four. On four.

1576
01:36:00,546 --> 01:36:03,840
- Come on.
- Shuttle flight capability not yet known.

1577
01:36:04,216 --> 01:36:05,216
- Bump the signal.
- Bumping.

1578
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:06,593
Houston. Houston.

1579
01:36:06,677 --> 01:36:09,220
We lost 'em. Get 'em back.
Gruber, we need that hookup.

1580
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:13,975
Show you how we do things
where I come from.

1581
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:23,526
Hold on!

1582
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:34,704
Seat it.

1583
01:36:35,372 --> 01:36:38,082
All right, get ready. Max, thread it.

1584
01:36:39,543 --> 01:36:42,670
Guys, the clock is tickin'.
Let's go, go, go, go, go!

1585
01:36:42,755 --> 01:36:44,839
All right! Good! Crank it loose!

1586
01:36:44,924 --> 01:36:48,009
Keep it at 25.
Let's kick a little asteroid butt!

1587
01:36:48,093 --> 01:36:50,303
All right, Chick. Give me more torque
on the turbine, huh?

1588
01:36:51,722 --> 01:36:53,139
Max, I need some more power
down here!

1589
01:36:53,224 --> 01:36:54,557
- All right, boss.
- Throw it in fourth,

1590
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:55,809
then drop the hammer.

1591
01:36:55,893 --> 01:36:57,477
Let's drill through this turd.

1592
01:36:57,561 --> 01:36:59,979
Come on, boys.
We gotta hop. We're fallin' behind.

1593
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:02,982
Dig, dig, dig. Chew this iron bitch up.

1594
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:09,989
- Chick, the tranny's stuck.
- Harry!

1595
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:11,449
What is it?

1596
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:13,076
Chick, come on! Help!

1597
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,828
- Release the clutch!
- Pull it up!

1598
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:17,455
Okay. Well, this thing's not movin'.

1599
01:37:18,457 --> 01:37:21,084
No, no, no! Shut it down! Shut it...

1600
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:30,343
This is not workin' out, Harry.

1601
01:37:30,427 --> 01:37:34,514
- Oh, are you all right?
- Oh, blew the tranny. Blew the tranny.

1602
01:37:35,808 --> 01:37:37,267
Come on, God.

1603
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:41,813
Just a little help. That's all I'm askin'.

1604
01:37:42,481 --> 01:37:45,650
I think we're close enough.
He might've heard ya.

1605
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:50,864
Here's the bad news.
Before the asteroid passed the moon,

1606
01:37:50,948 --> 01:37:54,200
her rotation was stable
at 32 degrees on an x axis.

1607
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:58,204
But now look at this.
The lunar gravity's put her in a spin.

1608
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:02,000
She's tumbling on all three axes.
This wasn't expected, sir.

1609
01:38:02,084 --> 01:38:04,669
- What does this do for communications?
- Not good.

1610
01:38:04,753 --> 01:38:07,422
We'll have definite contact with
the shuttle for only seven more minutes.

1611
01:38:07,506 --> 01:38:10,300
- After that it's radio darkness.
- For how long?

1612
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:14,137
And after seven minutes,
we may never hear from them again.

1613
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:16,097
But we're trying to bounce a signal

1614
01:38:16,181 --> 01:38:18,641
off a Russian military satellite,
reestablish contact that way.

1615
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:20,560
If we lose the shuttle com,

1616
01:38:20,644 --> 01:38:23,187
when do we lose the ability
to remote detonate that nuke?

1617
01:38:23,272 --> 01:38:25,690
The weapon remote receives a signal
from a Milstar satellite.

1618
01:38:25,774 --> 01:38:27,775
Higher orbit, more powerful transmitter.

1619
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,777
If we've got the shuttle
for seven minutes,

1620
01:38:29,862 --> 01:38:32,196
we can remote detonate
for an additional five.

1621
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:34,407
What he's trying to say, General,
is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time,

1622
01:38:34,491 --> 01:38:38,119
you may lose the ability
to detonate the nuke... permanently.

1623
01:38:38,203 --> 01:38:40,038
I've got to inform the president.

1624
01:38:41,665 --> 01:38:44,250
Just want to make sure you know
we're stuck on an asteroid.

1625
01:38:44,335 --> 01:38:46,252
- Do you know what you're doing now?
- No, no.

1626
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:49,631
You know what? I have no idea
what I'm doing. I have no idea.

1627
01:38:49,715 --> 01:38:52,008
This button,
I don't know what that does, okay?

1628
01:38:52,092 --> 01:38:54,636
All I know is
that we just crashed back there,

1629
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:57,597
I lost two of my friends,
we're 25 miles from Harry's shuttle.

1630
01:38:57,681 --> 01:39:00,099
We don't know if he's alive.
We don't know if he can fly.

1631
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:01,893
All I know is,
there's a beep on this thing

1632
01:39:01,977 --> 01:39:03,102
and I'm trying to get us there.

1633
01:39:11,862 --> 01:39:13,863
Let's get it unpacked.

1634
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:15,949
What's up?

1635
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:18,743
We're drilling through some
kind of metal I've never seen before.

1636
01:39:18,827 --> 01:39:21,788
It's fried two of our drill bits,
and now we blew our first transmission.

1637
01:39:21,872 --> 01:39:22,872
So how deep are we?

1638
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:24,666
We could use your help
with the transmission, Colonel.

1639
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:27,627
I have an assessment report due now.
We're supposed to be at 200 feet.

1640
01:39:27,711 --> 01:39:30,463
- So how deep are we?
- Not as deep as we'll be

1641
01:39:30,547 --> 01:39:32,048
when you quit askin' me
these questions

1642
01:39:32,132 --> 01:39:33,716
and help us load this transmission on.

1643
01:39:33,801 --> 01:39:35,051
What is our current depth?

1644
01:39:35,135 --> 01:39:36,928
Our current depth
is not important, Colonel.

1645
01:39:37,012 --> 01:39:40,056
I'll decide what's important.
We've got 800 feet to drill.

1646
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:43,142
You've had two and a half hours.
Where are we?

1647
01:39:44,853 --> 01:39:46,437
We're at 57 feet.

1648
01:39:47,064 --> 01:39:48,064
Now, if you're not too busy,

1649
01:39:48,148 --> 01:39:50,441
maybe you can give us a hand
with this transmission.

1650
01:39:50,526 --> 01:39:52,068
Colonel Sharp!

1651
01:39:53,195 --> 01:39:55,905
Get this strapped up. I'll be right back.
Colonel Sharp!

1652
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:59,200
All right. I'm coming through.
We have contact. Over.

1653
01:39:59,284 --> 01:40:01,869
That's as clear as it's gonna get.

1654
01:40:02,621 --> 01:40:04,831
Houston, this is Freedom. Do you copy?

1655
01:40:04,915 --> 01:40:07,500
Working at a remote satellite link
at this moment.

1656
01:40:07,584 --> 01:40:08,835
- Transmission change.
- Colonel!

1657
01:40:08,919 --> 01:40:11,587
Twenty minutes.
Puts drilling final at ten hours.

1658
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:15,174
Please advise. That's four hours
past the zero barrier. Please advise.

1659
01:40:15,259 --> 01:40:18,052
What the hell is this? "Zero depth"?

1660
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:21,014
And where'd this come from?
Who are you talkin' to? Is that Truman?

1661
01:40:21,098 --> 01:40:22,515
Lemme have that phone.
Gimme the phone.

1662
01:40:22,599 --> 01:40:25,560
Truman! Look, this is what happens
when you drill.

1663
01:40:25,644 --> 01:40:29,897
We cannot use your "U.S. Air Force
Personnel Only" drill time card.

1664
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:32,108
- Who wrote this thing, by the way?
- We're losing coms again.

1665
01:40:32,192 --> 01:40:34,402
Look. Is he getting this?
Does he hear me or...

1666
01:40:34,486 --> 01:40:35,820
- What's wrong with this?
- The com's down.

1667
01:40:35,904 --> 01:40:36,863
What do you mean, "the com's down"?

1668
01:40:36,947 --> 01:40:38,281
What do I mean?
I mean we've lost

1669
01:40:38,365 --> 01:40:39,907
- communication to mission control.
- Fine.

1670
01:40:39,992 --> 01:40:41,951
Let's go back to the cargo bay
and get the transmission...

1671
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:45,371
Harry, guess what. You had your shot.
You didn't do it. You understand me?

1672
01:40:45,456 --> 01:40:47,206
- You can't...
- Why don't you stay here...

1673
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:52,003
Write a report, why don't ya?
That'll be...

1674
01:40:53,797 --> 01:40:55,965
My men and I will go
and get this hole dug!

1675
01:40:56,050 --> 01:41:00,053
You and your men are the biggest
mistake in the history of NASA.

1676
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:05,433
- We've lost communication.
- Oh, God.

1677
01:41:07,978 --> 01:41:12,190
- We're not lookin' too good right now.
- No shit.

1678
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:14,942
We gotta get that radio back up.

1679
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:20,531
Mr. President,
it's time to make a decision.

1680
01:41:20,616 --> 01:41:24,911
We can remote detonate the bomb
for only another five minutes.

1681
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:29,665
Yes? Kimsey here. Yes, Mr. President.

1682
01:41:30,959 --> 01:41:33,002
Yes, we saw that, too, sir.

1683
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:36,339
But maybe we should wait until they...

1684
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:45,973
Dan, get them out of there.

1685
01:41:46,809 --> 01:41:49,185
- Evac right now.
- What's goin' on here?

1686
01:41:49,269 --> 01:41:51,104
I've been ordered
to override the system.

1687
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:58,027
Well, what is this?

1688
01:42:02,491 --> 01:42:04,242
Secondary protocol.

1689
01:42:10,499 --> 01:42:13,126
But they haven't drilled
the damn hole yet!

1690
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:19,549
The president's advisors feel
that the drilling isn't working.

1691
01:42:19,633 --> 01:42:21,509
And we've lost radio contact,
maybe for good.

1692
01:42:21,593 --> 01:42:22,635
We've only got a few minutes left of

1693
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:24,846
guaranteed ability to
remote detonate that nuke.

1694
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:27,431
If we don't do it now we could lose
control, and we may never get it back.

1695
01:42:27,516 --> 01:42:30,726
Well, you tell the president that
he better fire his so-called advisors.

1696
01:42:30,811 --> 01:42:32,311
If you detonate that nuke on the surface,

1697
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:34,105
we waste a perfectly good bomb,

1698
01:42:34,189 --> 01:42:36,023
and we have one chance
to save this planet!

1699
01:42:47,077 --> 01:42:48,619
I need that radio.

1700
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:51,330
Gruber, give me
everything you got now!

1701
01:42:51,415 --> 01:42:52,456
Roger that.

1702
01:42:55,794 --> 01:42:57,503
Yes, Mr. President,
I understand that completely,

1703
01:42:57,588 --> 01:42:59,630
but my point is very, very simple.

1704
01:42:59,715 --> 01:43:02,258
And I think you need to trust me on this
because I know something about it.

1705
01:43:02,342 --> 01:43:05,970
I guarantee you,
if you do this, you kill us all.

1706
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:10,766
Yes, sir.

1707
01:43:11,268 --> 01:43:14,020
General, he wants you.

1708
01:43:15,898 --> 01:43:18,149
This is Kimsey. Yes, sir.

1709
01:43:19,276 --> 01:43:20,735
I understand.

1710
01:43:23,655 --> 01:43:27,325
The orders are to remote detonate
in 30 seconds.

1711
01:43:27,409 --> 01:43:32,538
You have not told them yet!
That is my father up there!

1712
01:43:32,623 --> 01:43:35,958
This is one order you shouldn't follow,
and you fucking know it!

1713
01:43:36,043 --> 01:43:38,002
Let her go. Let her go!

1714
01:43:40,964 --> 01:43:42,465
Your key, sir.

1715
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:49,305
God be with them.

1716
01:43:50,432 --> 01:43:52,058
Slow it down.

1717
01:43:58,649 --> 01:43:59,941
Harry,

1718
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:04,111
the clock on that nine-foot
nuclear weapon is ticking.

1719
01:44:05,656 --> 01:44:09,825
Oh, my God! Sharp! Get back here now!

1720
01:44:10,494 --> 01:44:12,578
What?
Get the shuttle ready to evac now!

1721
01:44:12,663 --> 01:44:13,913
It just came on all by itself.

1722
01:44:13,997 --> 01:44:15,539
- What the hell's happening?
- Secondary protocol.

1723
01:44:15,624 --> 01:44:17,541
- What's that? What?
- Secondary protocol.

1724
01:44:17,626 --> 01:44:19,168
- What does that mean?
- What the hell's secondary protocol?

1725
01:44:19,253 --> 01:44:20,461
They're detonating this thing from Earth.

1726
01:44:20,545 --> 01:44:21,629
What do you mean, detonating?

1727
01:44:21,713 --> 01:44:22,880
- We haven't even drilled the hole yet!
- We'll drop it in the hole.

1728
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:24,131
- What're you talkin' about?
- The hole?

1729
01:44:24,216 --> 01:44:25,299
Get your helmets on now!

1730
01:44:25,384 --> 01:44:28,386
- Oh, no, no. How... How you turn it off?
- I got two men out on that rock!

1731
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:30,721
I got a man out there, too.
We gotta evac now.

1732
01:44:30,806 --> 01:44:32,765
Max, Rockhound,
get back to the shuttle, double-time!

1733
01:44:32,849 --> 01:44:35,768
- They could be on their way here.
- They're not on their way here.

1734
01:44:35,852 --> 01:44:38,604
They would've talked to us by now.
We would've seen them.

1735
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:41,899
- Watts, air lock the cockpit now!
- I copy you.

1736
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:43,818
- Max, Rockhound!
- Hey, wait a minute!

1737
01:44:43,902 --> 01:44:45,278
How do you turn this thing off?

1738
01:44:46,655 --> 01:44:48,698
- Harry, do you copy?
- Something's wrong.

1739
01:44:48,782 --> 01:44:51,617
Yeah, it's all wrong, man.
We shouldn't even be up here.

1740
01:44:51,702 --> 01:44:53,619
I know. Let's go back to the ship!

1741
01:44:54,871 --> 01:44:56,580
I'm not leavin' without my men, Sharp.

1742
01:44:56,665 --> 01:44:59,417
We've got two and a half minutes
to drop it and get off this rock.

1743
01:44:59,501 --> 01:45:01,961
If they're not back by the time we finish,
we leave without 'em.

1744
01:45:02,045 --> 01:45:04,463
Okay, let's simplify this.
Let's just turn the bomb off right now.

1745
01:45:04,548 --> 01:45:07,508
If we don't put this bomb down
in a hole 800 feet onto a fault line,

1746
01:45:07,592 --> 01:45:09,719
all you're gonna have is
a real expensive fireworks show.

1747
01:45:09,803 --> 01:45:12,263
This is turnin' into a
surrealistic nightmare here.

1748
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:14,974
Watsler, are you listening? It's Truman.

1749
01:45:15,058 --> 01:45:18,894
Okay, listen to me carefully.
I want you to kill it. Kill the uplink.

1750
01:45:30,407 --> 01:45:32,908
Give us the time, Sharp.
Shut this bomb down now!

1751
01:45:32,993 --> 01:45:34,577
- It's not my call.
- Then whose call is it?

1752
01:45:34,661 --> 01:45:36,662
An order to detonate can
only come from the president.

1753
01:45:36,747 --> 01:45:38,289
- The president's not here!
- Let's just turn it off now.

1754
01:45:38,373 --> 01:45:39,498
You've gotta give us more time!

1755
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:40,833
I'm telling you to
shut this bomb down now!

1756
01:45:40,917 --> 01:45:42,501
And I'm telling you it's not my call!

1757
01:45:42,586 --> 01:45:44,503
Well, guess what.
I just made the call for you.

1758
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:45,796
Harry!

1759
01:45:47,924 --> 01:45:51,010
Don't. You could set it off.

1760
01:45:51,094 --> 01:45:54,680
Oh, man.
What're you doin' with a gun in space?

1761
01:45:57,768 --> 01:46:01,145
Come on, come on.
We gotta stop that bomb right now.

1762
01:46:01,229 --> 01:46:02,521
Kill the uplink.

1763
01:46:02,898 --> 01:46:04,732
This thing is gonna blow.

1764
01:46:04,816 --> 01:46:07,777
- We gotta get it off the ship.
- Easy.

1765
01:46:07,861 --> 01:46:09,195
Stand down, Sergeant.

1766
01:46:09,279 --> 01:46:13,199
Shut this bomb down
and let us finish our job the right way.

1767
01:46:13,283 --> 01:46:15,910
I'm under orders to protect
a surface detonation.

1768
01:46:15,994 --> 01:46:18,287
I'm gonna give you three seconds
to shut this bomb down,

1769
01:46:18,372 --> 01:46:20,206
and then I'm gonna make you shoot me.

1770
01:46:21,249 --> 01:46:23,584
Hurry, Watsler. For Christ's sake, hurry.

1771
01:46:27,631 --> 01:46:29,507
What happened?

1772
01:46:33,804 --> 01:46:37,348
Sir, the override... It's been overridden.

1773
01:46:38,308 --> 01:46:39,392
I bought us a couple of minutes,

1774
01:46:39,476 --> 01:46:41,519
so get that radio workin', okay?
Hurry, hurry!

1775
01:46:44,147 --> 01:46:47,900
Bring me all the way up here just to
blow me and my friends up? Is that it?

1776
01:46:47,984 --> 01:46:50,736
- Listen...
- Shut up!

1777
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:54,740
Shut up, Colonel. I'm talking now.

1778
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:56,826
It could start again.
It might've been a warning.

1779
01:46:58,995 --> 01:46:59,954
Uh-oh.

1780
01:47:00,038 --> 01:47:02,456
That's why you are gonna
dismantle this bomb.

1781
01:47:02,541 --> 01:47:05,126
All right. What'd we miss?

1782
01:47:09,631 --> 01:47:12,508
- Do it again.
- Go.

1783
01:47:15,971 --> 01:47:17,888
Keep tryin'.

1784
01:47:19,182 --> 01:47:23,769
Sir, I need you to cease and desist.
I need your terminal... Now.

1785
01:47:27,149 --> 01:47:29,942
- They're reactivating the bomb.
- Comin' back on-line, sir.

1786
01:47:30,026 --> 01:47:33,320
Oh, geez. Here we go again.

1787
01:47:33,405 --> 01:47:36,449
What're you doin' up here? And why
did you even bother to make the trip?

1788
01:47:36,533 --> 01:47:39,118
To do the right thing,
to see that it's done.

1789
01:47:47,043 --> 01:47:50,087
For God's sakes,
think about what you're doin'.

1790
01:47:50,172 --> 01:47:53,632
Why are you listenin' to someone
that's 100,000 miles away?

1791
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:57,303
We're here.
Nobody down there can help us.

1792
01:47:57,387 --> 01:48:01,182
So if we don't get this job done,
then everybody's gone.

1793
01:48:01,266 --> 01:48:02,808
One minute.

1794
01:48:03,894 --> 01:48:06,604
I've been drillin' holes
in the earth for 30 years.

1795
01:48:06,688 --> 01:48:11,442
And I have never, never missed
a depth that I have aimed for.

1796
01:48:11,526 --> 01:48:14,987
And by God, I am not gonna miss
this one. I will make 800 feet.

1797
01:48:15,071 --> 01:48:16,864
Forty-two seconds.

1798
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:21,160
But I can't do it alone, Colonel.
I need your help.

1799
01:48:21,244 --> 01:48:24,747
You swear on your daughter's life,
on my family's,

1800
01:48:24,831 --> 01:48:27,500
that you can hit that mark?

1801
01:48:27,584 --> 01:48:31,879
I will make 800 feet.
I swear to God, I will.

1802
01:48:31,963 --> 01:48:34,423
Then let's turn this bomb off.

1803
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:47,937
Steady. Take it back.

1804
01:48:48,021 --> 01:48:49,939
That's what you'll have to do.
Get 'em off backwards.

1805
01:48:50,023 --> 01:48:51,524
Rainbow track? Under...

1806
01:48:51,608 --> 01:48:53,150
- Under one? Under... Okay.
- All of 'em. All of 'em.

1807
01:48:53,235 --> 01:48:56,695
- Okay. Are we free of static?
- Oh, do a good job. Do a good job.

1808
01:48:56,780 --> 01:48:59,073
- Steady. Steady.
- Good job. All right. All right.

1809
01:48:59,157 --> 01:49:02,868
Go! Go! Go! Red wire "A."
Ready? And...

1810
01:49:02,953 --> 01:49:04,745
Now. Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!

1811
01:49:06,164 --> 01:49:07,248
Negative "B."

1812
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:10,209
- Ready, and now.
- Do a good job. Do a good job.

1813
01:49:10,293 --> 01:49:11,710
Track flipped. Hot's in.

1814
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:13,128
- It better be. Go.
- Red or blue?

1815
01:49:16,299 --> 01:49:17,550
Re...

1816
01:49:22,764 --> 01:49:24,139
Blue.

1817
01:49:27,185 --> 01:49:28,394
Good job!

1818
01:49:33,733 --> 01:49:36,193
Oh, God, it sucks up here.

1819
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:39,697
Sir, the clock has stopped
at three seconds.

1820
01:49:39,781 --> 01:49:41,031
What?

1821
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,867
Have we lost complete radio contact?

1822
01:49:43,952 --> 01:49:45,077
I got some magic happening.

1823
01:49:45,161 --> 01:49:46,495
We're bouncing off Russian
and French satellites.

1824
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:50,624
- It may have a faint signal.
- Houston? Houston, do you copy?

1825
01:49:52,335 --> 01:49:54,336
Go ahead, Freedom.

1826
01:49:54,671 --> 01:49:55,963
Houston, you have a problem...

1827
01:49:56,047 --> 01:49:57,423
Problem.

1828
01:49:57,507 --> 01:50:00,342
See, I promised my little girl
that I'd be comin' home.

1829
01:50:01,344 --> 01:50:04,221
Now, I don't know what you people
are doin' down there,

1830
01:50:04,306 --> 01:50:05,806
but we got a hole to dig up there.

1831
01:50:07,726 --> 01:50:09,602
Go, go, go, go! Come on.
We got work to do.

1832
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:13,439
Okay, guys. All go, no quit.
How ya doin' down there? Good?

1833
01:50:13,523 --> 01:50:16,442
Okay, got the tranny.
We're back in business.

1834
01:50:16,526 --> 01:50:20,362
Hey, you guys should take a break
and come up and see this.

1835
01:50:21,656 --> 01:50:24,450
Wow. Got a great view
of the Earth from here.

1836
01:50:24,534 --> 01:50:26,535
Too bad we'll never
set foot on her again.

1837
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:29,079
- Lev, do you see anything?
- No.

1838
01:50:29,164 --> 01:50:32,458
Well, keep goin'. I'm not givin' up.

1839
01:50:32,542 --> 01:50:34,460
Hold up here, Bear.

1840
01:50:34,544 --> 01:50:36,629
- Oh, boy.
- This is great.

1841
01:50:36,713 --> 01:50:39,632
We just happen to run into
the Grand Canyon on the asteroid?

1842
01:50:39,716 --> 01:50:42,926
I told you, you took a wrong way,
a wrong road.

1843
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:46,347
What... What road?
Do you see any roads around here?

1844
01:50:46,431 --> 01:50:50,517
You know what? I do not have
much pleasure being near God's ear.

1845
01:50:50,602 --> 01:50:53,145
But you think this is
looking good, or what?

1846
01:50:53,229 --> 01:50:57,441
Lev, why don't you just do humanity
a favor and just shut the hell up?

1847
01:51:02,781 --> 01:51:04,615
Have you ever heard of Evel Knievel?

1848
01:51:04,699 --> 01:51:07,076
No, I never saw Star Wars.

1849
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:15,542
All right. Doin' a good job.

1850
01:51:15,627 --> 01:51:18,337
- Give me a depth reading, Max.
- We're 150 feet, Harry.

1851
01:51:22,509 --> 01:51:23,676
Yee-ha!

1852
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:27,304
Ride 'em, cowboy!
Yippee-kai-yo, kai-yay!

1853
01:51:27,389 --> 01:51:31,809
Get off the nuclear warhead.

1854
01:51:31,893 --> 01:51:34,561
I was doin' that guy from that movie,
you know, Slim Pickens,

1855
01:51:34,646 --> 01:51:37,106
where he rides it all the way in,
the nuclear warhead.

1856
01:51:37,190 --> 01:51:40,067
- Now.
- Oh, you didn't see that one, huh?

1857
01:51:40,151 --> 01:51:43,028
We got 700 feet of hole to dig,
Rockhound.

1858
01:51:43,113 --> 01:51:47,700
All right. Just... Just wanted to feel
the power between my legs, brother.

1859
01:51:48,827 --> 01:51:50,786
Hey, Sharp.

1860
01:51:50,870 --> 01:51:53,747
No nukes!
No nukes! No nukes!

1861
01:51:53,832 --> 01:51:55,833
You got any more bullets
in that gun, Sharp?

1862
01:51:56,167 --> 01:51:58,335
What did Watts tell you, Bear?
If she kicked you in the balls,

1863
01:51:58,420 --> 01:51:59,545
- you'd keep floating.
- Yeah.

1864
01:52:02,465 --> 01:52:04,842
We turn the thrusters off,
we jump this thing,

1865
01:52:04,926 --> 01:52:06,635
we float right over it.

1866
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:09,221
Go over it again, Lev.

1867
01:52:09,305 --> 01:52:12,683
Throw the jet thrusters off
exactly when we jump.

1868
01:52:12,767 --> 01:52:14,268
- Okay.
- And then we're gonna put them on,

1869
01:52:14,352 --> 01:52:16,395
and we gonna go down nice and slow.

1870
01:52:16,479 --> 01:52:20,065
- That's it. That's it, baby. That's it.
- Is this gonna work?

1871
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:24,236
- I don't know.
- Lev, you know what, just lie to me.

1872
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:28,240
Let's say 50-50... No. More like, uh...

1873
01:52:28,324 --> 01:52:31,368
Like 70-30 or 80-20.
But you know what?

1874
01:52:31,453 --> 01:52:35,914
If it works, the two of you
gonna be heroes, just like me.

1875
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:38,834
Screw it.
We're jumpin' over this canyon.

1876
01:52:43,006 --> 01:52:46,008
Just for the record,
this is a very bad idea!

1877
01:52:49,471 --> 01:52:50,554
Wait for the edge.

1878
01:52:50,638 --> 01:52:52,806
- Don't hit it till we get there.
- I'm waiting.

1879
01:52:53,683 --> 01:52:55,976
Three.

1880
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:59,438
Two. One!

1881
01:53:09,324 --> 01:53:12,618
- Yes! It's working!
- It's working!

1882
01:53:12,702 --> 01:53:13,869
Oh, my God!

1883
01:53:15,288 --> 01:53:20,584
I'm a genius! Wait a minute.

1884
01:53:20,668 --> 01:53:22,753
- We got some rocks!
- Go left! Go left!

1885
01:53:22,837 --> 01:53:25,422
Lev, Lev, I can't do anything!

1886
01:53:35,183 --> 01:53:37,810
Oh, okay, okay,
we're floating into outer space.

1887
01:53:37,894 --> 01:53:39,311
- Check main switch.
- Uh, this could be

1888
01:53:39,395 --> 01:53:41,438
a little bit of a problem.

1889
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:43,690
- Thrusters on... Now!
- All right, turn 'em on.

1890
01:53:46,861 --> 01:53:48,529
- What's wrong?
- I... I don't know.

1891
01:53:48,613 --> 01:53:52,115
The... The thrusters not working.
I hate this machine!

1892
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:53,325
I thought you had this planned!

1893
01:53:53,409 --> 01:53:55,077
- What're we supposed to do?
- Be quiet! I must think!

1894
01:53:55,161 --> 01:53:57,830
- I'm stepping outside.
- You're... You're going outside?

1895
01:53:57,914 --> 01:54:03,418
I am the only certified astronaut,
and I'm saving your American ass!

1896
01:54:07,632 --> 01:54:10,092
Yes. You'll listen to him. Right.

1897
01:54:15,265 --> 01:54:19,059
Hurry up, Lev, because we're
about a mile off the asteroid!

1898
01:54:19,143 --> 01:54:22,479
Just a second. The fuel line is iced up.

1899
01:54:22,564 --> 01:54:26,608
- I think maybe workin' now.
- No, Lev, it's not working!

1900
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:29,611
I'm sorry, A.J., I was way off the odds.

1901
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:31,113
We're gettin' higher, man.

1902
01:54:31,197 --> 01:54:34,575
Look out! The rocks! Rocks are coming!

1903
01:54:40,832 --> 01:54:42,374
Hold on!

1904
01:54:46,796 --> 01:54:49,548
- Pull the thrusters!
- Lev, look out!

1905
01:54:56,556 --> 01:54:58,390
- We lost Lev.
- A.J.!

1906
01:54:59,767 --> 01:55:02,060
A.J., the thrusters!

1907
01:55:06,274 --> 01:55:08,025
Let's get Lev back!

1908
01:55:16,492 --> 01:55:19,244
Lev, hold on! We're comin' in!

1909
01:55:35,845 --> 01:55:37,721
Thank You, Jesus. Thank You, Lord.

1910
01:55:37,805 --> 01:55:39,514
Thank You. Thank You,
thank You, thank You, thank You.

1911
01:55:40,141 --> 01:55:42,976
Lev!

1912
01:55:43,686 --> 01:55:48,315
- Now I'm really a Russian hero!
- I told you!

1913
01:55:48,399 --> 01:55:50,776
- I know!
- I knew this would work!

1914
01:55:50,860 --> 01:55:53,195
- Good odds, you know?
- Come on, Lev.

1915
01:55:53,279 --> 01:55:55,948
- Get in here. We gotta go.
- Yah!

1916
01:55:59,577 --> 01:56:01,828
Rockhound, keep on that transmission.

1917
01:56:01,913 --> 01:56:04,957
- Tranny looks good, Harry.
- All right. Take it outta there.

1918
01:56:05,041 --> 01:56:07,000
Lock it down, Chick.

1919
01:56:08,711 --> 01:56:10,253
Nice.

1920
01:56:11,339 --> 01:56:14,549
How come we didn't get
any training on this thing?

1921
01:56:14,634 --> 01:56:18,261
Whoa. Very cool. I could take out
this asteroid single-handedly.

1922
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:21,473
Okay, boys, give it a rest.
I'll take it from here.

1923
01:56:24,644 --> 01:56:26,353
- What the hell is that?
- It's Rockhound.

1924
01:56:26,437 --> 01:56:29,690
Whoa. This is so much fun, it's freaky.

1925
01:56:31,234 --> 01:56:32,192
Rockhound!

1926
01:56:33,569 --> 01:56:35,737
Whoa, watch your heads. Sorry, Harry.

1927
01:56:38,449 --> 01:56:40,826
- Outta my way, boys!
- Rockhound!

1928
01:56:40,910 --> 01:56:43,537
Meet your maker, asteroid!

1929
01:56:48,251 --> 01:56:50,002
What the hell's the matter with you,
Rockhound?

1930
01:56:50,086 --> 01:56:52,004
- Goddamn!
- This is insane.

1931
01:56:52,088 --> 01:56:53,630
- Have you lost your mind?
- No.

1932
01:56:53,715 --> 01:56:57,926
He's got space dementia.
Harry, you want to watch your man.

1933
01:57:00,388 --> 01:57:05,142
Max, downshift and put it in reverse.
We gotta get that pipe outta there.

1934
01:57:05,226 --> 01:57:06,393
Uh-oh.

1935
01:57:09,856 --> 01:57:12,190
- What's happening?
- The ground's cracking!

1936
01:57:12,275 --> 01:57:13,442
Earthquake!

1937
01:57:21,659 --> 01:57:23,535
Quick, shut it off!

1938
01:57:24,954 --> 01:57:28,331
- Shut it off! Shut it off now!
- We're gonna have a blowout!

1939
01:57:28,416 --> 01:57:31,043
- We hit a gas pocket!
- We got pressure out the ass!

1940
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:36,673
Max, get your helmet on!
Max, she's gonna blow!

1941
01:57:36,758 --> 01:57:40,052
- Aah! Oh, Jesus, I'm cooking!
- Max, get outta there!

1942
01:57:40,136 --> 01:57:44,473
This is it! Harry!

1943
01:57:46,976 --> 01:57:49,019
I'm bailing!

1944
01:57:52,106 --> 01:57:53,648
Max!

1945
01:57:56,319 --> 01:57:57,319
Good-bye, Max.

1946
01:57:57,403 --> 01:58:00,864
- Max!
- Take care, buddy.

1947
01:58:00,948 --> 01:58:03,033
- Armadillo's off the scope.
- I think we've had a blowout.

1948
01:58:03,117 --> 01:58:04,701
No sign of the Armadillo.

1949
01:58:36,275 --> 01:58:38,151
Get a hold of Truman.

1950
01:58:39,779 --> 01:58:41,613
Prepare the world for bad news.

1951
01:58:49,288 --> 01:58:51,665
We're getting
sketchy information that the mission

1952
01:58:51,749 --> 01:58:54,126
has suffered massive failure.

1953
01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:56,795
And what we're trying to do right now
is to confirm that

1954
01:58:56,879 --> 01:58:58,380
and find out exactly what that means.

1955
01:58:58,464 --> 01:59:01,633
Repeat. We're getting leaks
from several NASA officials,

1956
01:59:01,717 --> 01:59:03,468
some rushing home
to be with their families,

1957
01:59:03,553 --> 01:59:07,264
that the drilling was unsuccessful.

1958
01:59:16,065 --> 01:59:18,942
This could very well be our final hour.

1959
01:59:22,446 --> 01:59:24,447
We're gonna go off the air now.

1960
01:59:24,532 --> 01:59:26,825
Good luck and God bless.

1961
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:32,914
- We've got incoming.
- I got tracks.

1962
01:59:32,999 --> 01:59:35,625
NORAD's tracking four small
incoming over Europe.

1963
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:37,043
I think one's about to hit near Paris.

1964
02:00:03,446 --> 02:00:04,905
Reports are coming in.

1965
02:00:04,989 --> 02:00:07,532
Martial law
has been implemented in 42 countries.

1966
02:00:07,617 --> 02:00:10,076
Once the asteroid hits zero barrier,

1967
02:00:10,161 --> 02:00:14,414
it will take about three hours
and 57 minutes to impact Earth.

1968
02:00:18,502 --> 02:00:21,129
I guess we do it the president's way.
I'll order an evac.

1969
02:00:21,214 --> 02:00:22,464
You can remote detonate.

1970
02:00:22,548 --> 02:00:24,174
You still don't think this'll work, do you?

1971
02:00:24,258 --> 02:00:25,926
What I think is irrelevant.

1972
02:00:26,010 --> 02:00:29,095
- We need to do it now.
- Fine.

1973
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:31,348
- Can they still take off?
- We hope so.

1974
02:00:31,432 --> 02:00:33,475
You are the one that
pulled them into this!

1975
02:00:33,559 --> 02:00:37,062
That is my family up there,
so I don't wanna hear, "We hope so"!

1976
02:00:42,652 --> 02:00:46,363
Guess what, guys?
It's time to embrace the horror.

1977
02:00:46,447 --> 02:00:49,950
Look. We got front-row tickets
to the end of the Earth.

1978
02:01:12,056 --> 02:01:13,515
Yeah!

1979
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:14,891
Way to go, baby!

1980
02:01:14,976 --> 02:01:16,309
Harry!

1981
02:01:23,276 --> 02:01:25,568
Yo, Harry! What's up, baby?

1982
02:01:25,653 --> 02:01:28,321
Hey, get that bomb outta there!
We got a hole to make!

1983
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:31,616
Houston, you're not gonna believe this,

1984
02:01:31,701 --> 02:01:33,034
but the other Armadillo has arrived.

1985
02:01:35,246 --> 02:01:38,206
All right, people, listen up.
Settle down and focus.

1986
02:01:38,291 --> 02:01:40,709
- Mechanical, get on-line.
- P.P.O., gimme a setup.

1987
02:01:40,793 --> 02:01:42,711
Your boyfriend's back.

1988
02:01:43,212 --> 02:01:44,254
Yo, Harry!

1989
02:01:47,216 --> 02:01:49,217
Hey, Harry. You miss me?

1990
02:01:49,302 --> 02:01:52,721
A.J., I got just five words for ya.

1991
02:01:52,805 --> 02:01:55,974
- Damn glad to see ya, boy!
- That's six words.

1992
02:01:56,058 --> 02:01:57,350
Chick, walk 'em down.

1993
02:01:57,435 --> 02:01:58,977
So where's this hole
you need dug?

1994
02:01:59,603 --> 02:02:02,230
Houston, drilling has recommenced.

1995
02:02:02,315 --> 02:02:05,900
Do you think they can drill
250 feet in an hour?

1996
02:02:05,985 --> 02:02:07,485
They better.

1997
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:09,529
Bring that piece on in, Bear.

1998
02:02:10,531 --> 02:02:12,198
Tractor pull.

1999
02:02:12,908 --> 02:02:16,661
- I'm comin' down!
- We got 250 feet to go.

2000
02:02:16,746 --> 02:02:19,748
It's our last transmission, last drill head.

2001
02:02:19,832 --> 02:02:23,335
Punch it through.
First gear. We got contact.

2002
02:02:24,045 --> 02:02:25,420
Come on down, A.J.

2003
02:02:27,673 --> 02:02:28,923
I got this, man. Let's go!

2004
02:02:29,008 --> 02:02:30,675
Lev, the right engine hub.

2005
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:33,011
Houston, I'm getting no response
from the preflight sequence.

2006
02:02:33,095 --> 02:02:36,681
Come on, now.
This is not... Hey... Hey, come here.

2007
02:02:36,766 --> 02:02:39,059
Can you get me outta here, please, Lev?
Thank you.

2008
02:02:40,936 --> 02:02:43,980
- Ow! Jesus! Hey!
- Wait.

2009
02:02:44,065 --> 02:02:45,190
- Lev, the right engine...
- Okay.

2010
02:02:45,274 --> 02:02:49,778
Lemme outta here, will ya?
Just tryin' to have some fun before I die!

2011
02:02:49,862 --> 02:02:53,490
- How deep are we?
- Seven seventy.

2012
02:02:58,788 --> 02:03:00,914
- Whoa, they got problems.
- The gauges are spiking.

2013
02:03:00,998 --> 02:03:02,999
Methane! Shut it down! Back it down!

2014
02:03:03,084 --> 02:03:05,126
I can't pull back now.
The bit'll get lodged.

2015
02:03:05,211 --> 02:03:07,212
We don't have enough time!

2016
02:03:07,296 --> 02:03:10,965
Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's gonna blow!
It's how we lost Max!

2017
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:13,259
I know what I'm talkin' about.
We can punch through this.

2018
02:03:13,344 --> 02:03:14,928
We can knock this outta the park.

2019
02:03:15,012 --> 02:03:16,846
This is our last transmission, A.J.

2020
02:03:16,931 --> 02:03:19,140
Goddamn it, if you're ever
gonna trust me, ever,

2021
02:03:19,225 --> 02:03:22,102
once in your life, trust me now!

2022
02:03:22,186 --> 02:03:23,895
Harry, it's gonna blow!

2023
02:03:23,979 --> 02:03:27,065
Harry, I know what I'm doin'.
You just gotta trust me.

2024
02:03:28,526 --> 02:03:30,485
Make the call.

2025
02:03:32,738 --> 02:03:35,156
All right. Hold on.
I'm pushin' through her.

2026
02:03:40,871 --> 02:03:42,872
I'm pushin' through her!

2027
02:03:43,582 --> 02:03:46,751
- What's your depth?
- Seven seventy-five. Seven eighty.

2028
02:03:46,836 --> 02:03:49,129
Take it up, baby! Ram it home!

2029
02:03:49,713 --> 02:03:51,589
Drive on down, A.J.!

2030
02:03:51,674 --> 02:03:54,259
Seven eighty-five. Come on. Come on.

2031
02:03:54,343 --> 02:03:56,511
- Come on, A.J.!
- Punch it!

2032
02:03:56,595 --> 02:03:57,595
Ninety-one. Come on.

2033
02:03:57,680 --> 02:04:00,765
Seven ninety-two. Seven ninety-five!

2034
02:04:00,850 --> 02:04:03,017
Drive it down, A.J.!

2035
02:04:03,102 --> 02:04:06,020
Seven ninety-seven! Ninety-nine!

2036
02:04:06,105 --> 02:04:09,774
- Breakthrough!
- Eight hundred! Eight-oh-two, Harry!

2037
02:04:09,859 --> 02:04:11,568
- Yeah!
- We did it!

2038
02:04:13,487 --> 02:04:15,029
- Yes!
- We did it!

2039
02:04:15,114 --> 02:04:19,242
- Yeah! Kid, way to go!
- I knew it, baby!

2040
02:04:19,326 --> 02:04:21,327
It's not over till we get
the bomb down that hole.

2041
02:04:21,412 --> 02:04:23,079
Watts, they've got 38 minutes.

2042
02:04:44,018 --> 02:04:45,560
Harry,
you've gotta give me that hole.

2043
02:04:45,644 --> 02:04:48,688
I'm gonna need two more minutes.
I got a bent pipe jammed in the hole.

2044
02:04:48,772 --> 02:04:52,484
We gotta cut it out before
we can send that bomb down. A.J.!

2045
02:04:52,568 --> 02:04:54,611
- She good to go?
- Yeah, I'm all set.

2046
02:04:54,695 --> 02:04:56,070
All right.

2047
02:05:01,452 --> 02:05:03,620
- All right.
- A.J., come on! Make it fast!

2048
02:05:03,704 --> 02:05:06,998
I'm goin' as fast as I can!
There's a lot of gas pressure!

2049
02:05:13,923 --> 02:05:15,006
You feel that?

2050
02:05:15,090 --> 02:05:17,258
Harry, you gotta give me that hole.
The bomb is almost ready.

2051
02:05:17,343 --> 02:05:19,928
- Pull that pipe out!
- Harry, I'm almost through!

2052
02:05:20,012 --> 02:05:21,054
Give me 15 more seconds!

2053
02:05:27,186 --> 02:05:29,312
Well, this is somethin' new.

2054
02:05:31,982 --> 02:05:33,024
I don't think this thing likes us.

2055
02:05:33,108 --> 02:05:36,152
That's 'cause it knows
we're here to kill it.

2056
02:05:41,367 --> 02:05:43,368
Hey, what's goin' on up there?

2057
02:05:48,123 --> 02:05:49,541
A.J.!

2058
02:05:50,918 --> 02:05:53,211
- What the hell was that?
- A.J.!

2059
02:05:53,796 --> 02:05:55,838
Goddamn it, I'm finished!

2060
02:05:56,632 --> 02:05:59,467
- A.J., you all right?
- Oh, lot of gas pressure in here, man!

2061
02:05:59,552 --> 02:06:02,220
- Get me out!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hydrogen pocket!

2062
02:06:19,488 --> 02:06:22,657
Oh! Harry! Pull me in!

2063
02:06:25,744 --> 02:06:28,204
Aah! A.J., hang on!

2064
02:06:34,295 --> 02:06:36,004
Secure the bomb!

2065
02:06:37,172 --> 02:06:39,007
Sharp, heads up!

2066
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:42,302
Gruber! Get outta there now!

2067
02:06:43,887 --> 02:06:45,305
Oh, no.

2068
02:06:53,188 --> 02:06:55,148
Oh, God, no!

2069
02:07:01,697 --> 02:07:03,281
Look out!

2070
02:07:06,243 --> 02:07:09,370
Help! Oh, no!

2071
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:18,087
Do you believe that just happened?

2072
02:07:22,301 --> 02:07:24,427
- Sharp, you all right?
- I'm okay.

2073
02:07:24,511 --> 02:07:26,971
- Bear?
- Yeah. I'm here, Harry.

2074
02:07:27,056 --> 02:07:29,557
- A.J.?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

2075
02:07:32,186 --> 02:07:33,728
We lost Gruber.

2076
02:07:35,397 --> 02:07:36,898
Gruber's dead.

2077
02:07:37,650 --> 02:07:39,400
Let's get that bomb ready and go home.

2078
02:07:47,409 --> 02:07:48,493
Oh, my God.

2079
02:07:50,287 --> 02:07:52,163
Is there a problem, Colonel?

2080
02:07:52,247 --> 02:07:54,832
The timer, the remote,
the whole thing's dead.

2081
02:07:54,917 --> 02:07:57,001
What, the bomb is dead?

2082
02:07:57,086 --> 02:07:58,419
No, the trigger's dead.

2083
02:07:58,504 --> 02:08:01,673
It must've gotten damaged
during the rock storm.

2084
02:08:03,092 --> 02:08:05,093
So how do we detonate it?

2085
02:08:14,895 --> 02:08:19,190
We have 18 minutes to zero barrier.
We got some bad news.

2086
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:23,695
The remote detonator on the bomb
has been damaged.

2087
02:08:23,779 --> 02:08:26,656
That means that somebody's
gonna have to stay behind.

2088
02:08:28,742 --> 02:08:31,244
It takes two people to fly this thing.

2089
02:08:31,328 --> 02:08:35,123
Either we all stay and die,
or you guys draw straws.

2090
02:08:35,999 --> 02:08:39,836
I say we all stay and die. But that's me.

2091
02:08:40,879 --> 02:08:44,340
I'll draw. Let's draw.

2092
02:08:45,092 --> 02:08:48,010
Nobody's gonna draw straws.

2093
02:08:48,095 --> 02:08:49,387
I'll stay and take care of it.

2094
02:08:49,471 --> 02:08:51,514
- Well, I can't live with that sort of thing.
- Nobody asked you

2095
02:08:51,598 --> 02:08:52,807
- if you could live with it, all right?
- Bullshit!

2096
02:08:52,891 --> 02:08:55,476
No way I will let you volunteer for this

2097
02:08:55,561 --> 02:08:59,439
so I can go back to my home country
like the man who didn't volunteer.

2098
02:08:59,523 --> 02:09:01,149
No way!

2099
02:09:01,233 --> 02:09:05,695
Hey, man, let's draw, and let's see
who's gonna stay up here and dance.

2100
02:09:05,779 --> 02:09:08,531
Guys, I... I know you guys
think I'm crazy right now,

2101
02:09:08,615 --> 02:09:11,617
but I would really like this responsibility.

2102
02:09:12,411 --> 02:09:15,580
- All right. All right.
- I can do it.

2103
02:09:15,664 --> 02:09:17,498
Let's just draw straws
and get it over with. Come on.

2104
02:09:17,583 --> 02:09:19,250
I ain't drawin' against you, Harry.

2105
02:09:19,334 --> 02:09:20,793
Well, I'm gonna draw
against you, Chick,

2106
02:09:20,878 --> 02:09:23,546
so you better just go ahead and do it.

2107
02:09:24,256 --> 02:09:26,090
Just gimme this thing.

2108
02:09:33,766 --> 02:09:35,975
Is this good or bad?

2109
02:09:41,732 --> 02:09:43,274
Oh, man.

2110
02:09:44,568 --> 02:09:47,445
Well, we all gotta die, right?

2111
02:09:50,699 --> 02:09:53,659
I'm the guy who gets
to do it saving the world.

2112
02:09:53,744 --> 02:09:57,330
So, uh, let's go.
We... We got about ten minutes, right?

2113
02:09:59,208 --> 02:10:01,334
You plug this into the port.

2114
02:10:01,418 --> 02:10:05,588
Lift, press, hold. That's it.

2115
02:10:05,672 --> 02:10:10,218
Lift, press, hold. Shouldn't be too tough.
Even I can't screw this up.

2116
02:10:10,302 --> 02:10:12,094
I'll take him down.

2117
02:10:47,506 --> 02:10:52,552
Do me a favor, will ya?
Just tell Grace that, uh...

2118
02:10:52,636 --> 02:10:55,388
That I'll always be with her, okay?

2119
02:10:57,432 --> 02:10:59,392
Can you do that?

2120
02:11:00,936 --> 02:11:03,271
Yeah. Okay, kid.

2121
02:11:09,945 --> 02:11:11,696
Give this to Truman.

2122
02:11:11,780 --> 02:11:14,949
Make sure Truman gets that.
Get in there.

2123
02:11:20,914 --> 02:11:22,582
It's my turn now.

2124
02:11:22,666 --> 02:11:26,335
Harry! Harry!

2125
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:30,965
You can't do this to me! It's my job!

2126
02:11:31,967 --> 02:11:35,970
You go take care of my little girl now.
That's your job.

2127
02:11:39,516 --> 02:11:43,144
Always thought of you as a son. Always.

2128
02:11:43,896 --> 02:11:47,023
But I'd be damn proud
to have you marry Grace.

2129
02:11:48,150 --> 02:11:51,485
- Harry.
- You take care of yourself.

2130
02:11:51,570 --> 02:11:52,862
- Harry, no!
- I love you, pal.

2131
02:11:52,946 --> 02:11:56,240
Harry, I love you! Don't, Harry!
Wait a minute!

2132
02:11:56,325 --> 02:11:58,659
- My son.
- Don't do this, Harry!

2133
02:11:58,744 --> 02:12:01,621
Don't do this! Harry!

2134
02:12:09,922 --> 02:12:12,006
What happened?

2135
02:12:12,090 --> 02:12:14,550
That crazy, stubborn son of a...

2136
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:23,684
Well, this was a real good idea.

2137
02:12:24,645 --> 02:12:28,147
All right, let's go, Sharp.
Let's get our team outta here.

2138
02:12:33,487 --> 02:12:37,990
Come on! Let's get ready
to initiate thrusters! Let's go!

2139
02:12:38,075 --> 02:12:40,826
- Strap it in, guys!
- Get the O2 masks.

2140
02:12:40,911 --> 02:12:43,454
Are they green? Are they green?

2141
02:12:43,538 --> 02:12:45,665
I can't believe this is
going down like this.

2142
02:12:45,749 --> 02:12:47,166
You all right?

2143
02:12:47,250 --> 02:12:50,503
- O2 vents locked, pressure loaded.
- Engine board is green.

2144
02:12:53,256 --> 02:12:56,008
T minus three minutes
and counting.

2145
02:12:56,093 --> 02:12:58,803
Houston, do you copy?
This is Harry Stamper.

2146
02:12:59,930 --> 02:13:01,555
It's down there.

2147
02:13:03,725 --> 02:13:08,187
- Electrical systems primed.
- A.P.U. is set. Oxidizers are loading.

2148
02:13:08,689 --> 02:13:12,233
Houston, we're outta here
in T minus three minutes.

2149
02:13:13,193 --> 02:13:15,277
Daddy!

2150
02:13:15,362 --> 02:13:18,656
Hi, Gracie. Hi, honey.

2151
02:13:19,157 --> 02:13:22,618
Grace, I know I promised you
I was comin' home.

2152
02:13:23,912 --> 02:13:25,913
I don't under... Understand.

2153
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:30,084
Looks like I'm gonna
have to break that promise.

2154
02:13:32,629 --> 02:13:36,549
I, um... I lied to you, too,

2155
02:13:36,633 --> 02:13:39,844
when I told you that
I didn't want to be like you.

2156
02:13:41,513 --> 02:13:43,431
Because I am like you.

2157
02:13:44,224 --> 02:13:48,477
And everything good that I have
inside of me, I have from you.

2158
02:13:49,771 --> 02:13:51,856
I love you so much, Daddy.

2159
02:13:52,441 --> 02:13:54,233
I'm so proud of you.

2160
02:13:55,027 --> 02:13:58,738
I'm so scared.

2161
02:13:59,865 --> 02:14:04,535
I know it, baby, but there won't be
anything to be scared of soon.

2162
02:14:07,122 --> 02:14:11,959
Gracie, I want you to know
that A.J. saved us. He did.

2163
02:14:14,379 --> 02:14:16,297
I want you to tell Chick

2164
02:14:16,381 --> 02:14:19,675
that I couldn't have done it without him,
none of it.

2165
02:14:21,803 --> 02:14:24,138
I want you to take care of A.J.

2166
02:14:28,643 --> 02:14:31,479
I wish I could be there
to walk you down the aisle.

2167
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:36,317
But I'll...

2168
02:14:38,528 --> 02:14:42,281
I'll look in on you
from time to time, okay, honey?

2169
02:14:44,826 --> 02:14:46,285
I love you, Grace.

2170
02:14:46,369 --> 02:14:48,496
I love you, too.

2171
02:14:48,580 --> 02:14:51,373
- I gotta go now, honey.
- Daddy, no.

2172
02:14:52,167 --> 02:14:54,835
No, no, Dad, no.

2173
02:15:01,676 --> 02:15:05,221
O.M.S. pod pre-start.
O2 vents locked, pressure loaded.

2174
02:15:07,182 --> 02:15:09,600
What the hell's goin' on up there?
Why haven't you guys left yet?

2175
02:15:09,684 --> 02:15:12,103
We're going, Harry. Houston.

2176
02:15:12,187 --> 02:15:14,980
- We got O.M.S. pod pre-start.
- Pod pre-start confirmed.

2177
02:15:18,610 --> 02:15:19,652
- What's the problem?
- I don't know.

2178
02:15:19,736 --> 02:15:21,112
- What's wrong?
- Fix it now!

2179
02:15:23,156 --> 02:15:25,282
No time, no time!

2180
02:15:25,367 --> 02:15:27,326
- What?
- What's that?

2181
02:15:31,206 --> 02:15:33,457
- Where you goin'?
- Come on. We're stayin', we're goin'.

2182
02:15:33,542 --> 02:15:35,459
We're stayin', we're goin'.
Make up your mind.

2183
02:15:35,544 --> 02:15:38,712
Sharp, get out of here now.
You got less than three minutes.

2184
02:15:42,759 --> 02:15:44,260
Come on, Watts. Come on, come on.

2185
02:15:44,344 --> 02:15:46,554
Blow the bomb, Harry. We're with you.

2186
02:15:46,638 --> 02:15:50,307
- Uh, it's stuck. Yes?
- You don't know the components!

2187
02:15:50,392 --> 02:15:53,894
Components, American components,
Russian components.

2188
02:15:53,979 --> 02:15:55,521
All made in Taiwan!

2189
02:15:55,856 --> 02:15:58,274
We're gettin' tight for ignition, Freedom.

2190
02:16:01,027 --> 02:16:02,403
Houston, we've got no fire.

2191
02:16:02,487 --> 02:16:04,572
- What does that mean?
- It means we got a busted ship.

2192
02:16:04,656 --> 02:16:07,241
A busted ship?
And I'm strapped in here.

2193
02:16:07,325 --> 02:16:09,243
I had a great spot picked out there.

2194
02:16:09,619 --> 02:16:10,744
Freedom, you fire that engine.

2195
02:16:10,829 --> 02:16:12,913
If there's not a way, you find a way.
The clock's tickin'.

2196
02:16:12,998 --> 02:16:14,874
Let's go!
Let's fire that engine, Freedom!

2197
02:16:15,584 --> 02:16:18,752
You got less than a minute.
Don't think I won't blow this thing.

2198
02:16:20,672 --> 02:16:23,174
Sharp, get out of here.
It's gettin' bad down here.

2199
02:16:23,258 --> 02:16:25,342
I know how to fix it. Please, move.

2200
02:16:25,427 --> 02:16:27,761
I... I have to take you away
if you don't move.

2201
02:16:27,846 --> 02:16:30,848
Watts, you gotta get that shuttle started.
You gotta fire it up now!

2202
02:16:30,932 --> 02:16:32,892
Damn it, Sharp. Get off this rock!

2203
02:16:32,976 --> 02:16:35,060
I'm telling you, please, move!

2204
02:16:35,145 --> 02:16:40,357
This is how we fix problem
in the Russian space station.

2205
02:16:40,442 --> 02:16:43,527
Because I don't want
to stay here anymore.

2206
02:16:45,363 --> 02:16:49,241
Yeah! Finally! We can go home!

2207
02:16:49,326 --> 02:16:51,660
- She's coming back. She's coming back.
- We're hot!

2208
02:16:51,745 --> 02:16:54,288
Watts! Let's go, let's go!

2209
02:16:54,748 --> 02:16:57,458
Rain all you want, you son of a bitch.

2210
02:16:58,168 --> 02:17:01,212
Let's go! We don't have time!
Hurry, hurry. We got no time!

2211
02:17:01,296 --> 02:17:03,255
Initiate thrusters on my mark!

2212
02:17:03,340 --> 02:17:05,216
Two, one, mark!

2213
02:17:13,266 --> 02:17:15,100
Come on. Get some altitude.
Let's go, let's go.

2214
02:17:18,438 --> 02:17:20,522
Freedom has max thrust!

2215
02:17:27,322 --> 02:17:29,114
Thank you, Harry.

2216
02:17:40,126 --> 02:17:41,919
Shuttle's out of range.
Still no detonation.

2217
02:17:46,758 --> 02:17:49,093
Something's not right.
Too much time has gone by.

2218
02:17:51,346 --> 02:17:53,597
Zero barrier's about to be breached.
One minute.

2219
02:17:53,682 --> 02:17:56,433
Harry, come on. Press that button.

2220
02:17:56,518 --> 02:18:00,729
- We're goin' back and do it ourselves.
- Just don't. Wait one minute.

2221
02:18:04,943 --> 02:18:06,527
Dan, we're about to cross the threshold.

2222
02:18:06,611 --> 02:18:07,903
Come on. Press the button.

2223
02:18:07,988 --> 02:18:12,866
Colonel, I'm askin' you.
Just one more minute!

2224
02:18:19,624 --> 02:18:21,417
Press the button, Stamper.

2225
02:18:24,587 --> 02:18:25,879
Come on.

2226
02:18:28,717 --> 02:18:31,010
Harry'll do it. I know it.

2227
02:18:32,387 --> 02:18:33,887
He doesn't know how to fail.

2228
02:18:41,771 --> 02:18:43,564
We win, Gracie!

2229
02:18:44,607 --> 02:18:45,691
Press it!

2230
02:19:18,933 --> 02:19:22,019
We have detonation.
Confirming detonation.

2231
02:19:39,537 --> 02:19:41,872
The two halves are gonna miss us
by 400 miles,

2232
02:19:41,956 --> 02:19:44,875
and most of the small particles
have been vaporized.

2233
02:19:56,304 --> 02:19:59,056
- Houston, we're comin' home.
- We copy that, Freedom.

2234
02:19:59,140 --> 02:20:02,476
Yo, Harry, you the man.

2235
02:20:55,780 --> 02:20:59,616
Kennedy, we see you.
And you never looked so good.

2236
02:20:59,701 --> 02:21:03,328
I never told anybody this before
but I hate flyin',

2237
02:21:03,413 --> 02:21:05,330
so it'd be an awful shame to die now.

2238
02:21:05,415 --> 02:21:09,668
That's easy for you to say. I owe
100 grand to a bad-ass loan shark,

2239
02:21:09,752 --> 02:21:12,379
which I spent on a stripper
named Molly Mounds.

2240
02:21:12,505 --> 02:21:14,047
Boy, that's bad.

2241
02:21:14,132 --> 02:21:17,759
Kennedy, we are 100 percent.
Flap suspension control on full.

2242
02:21:30,773 --> 02:21:32,733
Welcome home, astronauts.

2243
02:21:41,159 --> 02:21:43,452
Hey, guys, remember,
we're heroes now.

2244
02:21:43,536 --> 02:21:45,913
So that incident with me
and the gun on the asteroid,

2245
02:21:45,997 --> 02:21:48,457
let's keep that under wraps, all right?

2246
02:22:52,689 --> 02:22:54,439
Miss Stamper.

2247
02:22:56,067 --> 02:22:58,819
Colonel Willie Sharp,
United States Air Force, ma'am.

2248
02:22:59,487 --> 02:23:02,447
Requesting permission to shake
the hand of the daughter

2249
02:23:02,532 --> 02:23:04,992
of the bravest man I've ever met.

2250
02:23:11,499 --> 02:23:12,916
Hello.

2251
02:23:13,001 --> 02:23:15,752
- Oh, my God!
- Hi, you're my hero.

2252
02:23:15,837 --> 02:23:18,547
Oh, baby, I wanna have babies with you.

2253
02:23:21,676 --> 02:23:23,635
Welcome back, cowboy.

2254
02:23:25,179 --> 02:23:29,433
Uh, Harry wanted you to have this.

2255
02:23:35,898 --> 02:23:37,608
He did, huh?

2256
02:23:56,127 --> 02:23:57,711
I could stay awake

2257
02:23:57,795 --> 02:24:01,548
Just to hear you breathin'

2258
02:24:03,051 --> 02:24:06,553
Watch you smile while you are sleepin'

2259
02:24:07,055 --> 02:24:10,849
While you're far away and dreamin'

2260
02:24:11,643 --> 02:24:15,187
I just wanna stay with you

2261
02:24:15,271 --> 02:24:18,440
In this moment forever

2262
02:24:18,524 --> 02:24:21,234
Forever and ever

2263
02:24:21,319 --> 02:24:25,322
I don't wanna close my eyes

2264
02:24:25,406 --> 02:24:27,824
I don't wanna fall asleep

2265
02:24:27,909 --> 02:24:30,035
'Cause I miss you, baby

2266
02:24:30,119 --> 02:24:32,954
And I don't wanna miss a thing

2267
02:24:33,206 --> 02:24:36,750
'Cause even when I dream of you

2268
02:24:37,335 --> 02:24:39,836
The sweetest dream would never do

2269
02:24:39,921 --> 02:24:41,922
I'd still miss you, baby

2270
02:24:42,006 --> 02:24:45,175
And I don't wanna miss a thing

2271
02:24:45,259 --> 02:24:49,179
And I don't wanna miss one smile

2272
02:24:49,263 --> 02:24:52,599
And I don't wanna miss one kiss

2273
02:24:53,226 --> 02:24:56,770
Well, I just wanna be
with you right here

2274
02:24:56,854 --> 02:25:00,607
With you just like this

2275
02:25:01,025 --> 02:25:04,903
Well, I just wanna hold you close

2276
02:25:05,113 --> 02:25:09,032
Feel your heart so close to mine

2277
02:25:09,575 --> 02:25:13,078
And just stay here in this moment

2278
02:25:13,162 --> 02:25:17,833
For all the rest of time

2279
02:25:18,084 --> 02:25:20,168
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

2280
02:25:20,253 --> 02:25:23,046
Yeah

2281
02:25:23,214 --> 02:25:26,341
Don't wanna close my eyes

2282
02:25:26,968 --> 02:25:29,428
I don't wanna fall asleep

2283
02:25:29,512 --> 02:25:31,513
'Cause I miss you, baby

2284
02:25:31,597 --> 02:25:34,683
And I don't wanna miss a thing

2285
02:25:34,809 --> 02:25:38,353
'Cause even when I dream of you

2286
02:25:38,813 --> 02:25:41,273
The sweetest dream would never do

2287
02:25:41,357 --> 02:25:43,400
I'd still miss you, baby

2288
02:25:43,484 --> 02:25:46,403
And I don't wanna miss a thing

2289
02:25:46,946 --> 02:25:49,656
Don't wanna close my eyes

2290
02:25:50,116 --> 02:25:54,369
I don't wanna fall asleep

2291
02:25:54,454 --> 02:25:58,123
Yeah
I don't wanna miss a thing

2292
02:29:03,601 --> 02:29:08,021
All my bags are packed
I'm ready to go

2293
02:29:08,356 --> 02:29:11,733
I'm standin' here outside your door

2294
02:29:12,193 --> 02:29:17,322
I hate to wake you up to say good-bye

2295
02:29:19,158 --> 02:29:23,036
But the dawn is breakin'
It's early morn

2296
02:29:23,496 --> 02:29:27,207
The taxi's waitin'
He's blowin' his horn

2297
02:29:27,375 --> 02:29:30,794
Already I'm so lonesome

2298
02:29:30,878 --> 02:29:32,879
I could die

2299
02:29:34,548 --> 02:29:38,969
So kiss me and smile for me

2300
02:29:39,387 --> 02:29:42,889
Tell me that you'll wait for me

2301
02:29:43,224 --> 02:29:48,478
Hold me like you'll never let me go

2302
02:29:49,981 --> 02:29:54,651
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane

2303
02:29:54,860 --> 02:29:58,738
I don't know when I'll be back again

2304
02:29:59,407 --> 02:30:04,035
Oh, babe, I hate to go

2305
