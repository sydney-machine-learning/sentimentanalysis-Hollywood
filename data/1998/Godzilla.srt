1
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,760
I'm singing in the rain

2
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,640
Just singing in the rain

3
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,600
What a glorious feeling

4
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,760
I'm happy again

5
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,240
Whoa!

6
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,160
Let the stormy clouds chase

7
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,640
Everyone from the place

8
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,960
I'm laughing at clouds

9
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,560
So dark up above

10
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,000
The sun's in my eyes

11
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,600
And I'm ready for love

12
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,120
Come on, bring on that rain

13
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm happy again

14
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,960
Come on with the rain
There's a smile on my face

15
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,640
I'm dancing with worms

16
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,480
Whoa!

17
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,560
A permit? Damn! How do you say "permit"?
I have a permit.

18
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,400
- Dr. Niko Tapopopolis?
- It's Tatopoulos.

19
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,600
Kyle Terrington.
I'm with the U.S. State Department.

20
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,400
- What are they doing?
- You're being reassigned.

21
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,000
My work here isn't finished.

22
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,720
It is now.

23
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,960
What did you see, old man?

24
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,560
That's affirmative.

25
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,120
Hey, where you going
with my stuff?

26
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,240
Hello?

27
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,320
Hello. That's very delicate.

28
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,160
Thank you.

29
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,600
Dr. Niko Topodopeles?

30
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,200
- It's Tatopoulos.
- Whatever.

31
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,440
Get these people off the pier.

32
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,320
- Sir, what am I doing here?
- Watch your step and don't talk.

33
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,520
Get them off the damn pier!

34
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,160
- Is this some kind of spill?
- Something like that.

35
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,880
I work for the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission...

36
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,240
but accidents and spills
are not my field.

37
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,960
We know.

38
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,320
Do you know you've interrupted a study
of the Chernobyl earthworm?

39
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Yeah, you're the worm guy, right?

40
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,360
Radioactive contamination in that area
has mutated the earthworm's DNA.

41
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,600
- You know what that means?
- No, but I'm about to find out.

42
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,200
It means that because
of a man-made accident...

43
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,360
Chernobyl earthworms are now
17% larger than they were before.

44
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,720
17%, huh?
Sounds pretty big.

45
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,720
They're enormous.
That's what I'm trying to say.

46
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,920
I'm a biologist. I take
radioactive samples and I study them.

47
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,880
That's great.
Here's your sample.

48
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,840
- Study it.
- What sample?

49
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,840
- You're standing in it.
- I don't see it.

50
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,240
Where is it?

51
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,200
I don't see it.

52
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,360
Colonel! Colonel!

53
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,880
That was a footprint!
I was standing inside of a footprint.

54
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,760
That's right.

55
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,320
There's no animal in the world that
makes footprints like that, is there?

56
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,040
I told them this is not your field,
but they never listen to genius.

57
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,880
Nick, this is Elsie Chapman of
the National Institute of Paleontology.

58
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,680
She's your boss.

59
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,840
- Those were footprints, right?
- Yes, they were.

60
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,960
- Anybody see what made them?
- Actually, no such luck.

61
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,680
It happened so fast, nobody knew
what hit them until it was over.

62
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,120
- Elsie?
- Yeah?

63
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,240
Tape's in.
The French finally released it.

64
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,360
This is a Japanese cannery ship that was
attacked and sunk near French Polynesia.

65
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,520
We believe it's connected.
Dr. Craven, have you met the "worm guy"?

66
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,320
Oh, sorry. Summer cold.

67
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,680
Come on, come on ! All right?

68
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,880
Have a nice day.

69
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,040
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

70
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,160
- It's supposed to rain all week.
- What's with the bags?

71
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,880
Caiman's groceries.

72
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,160
Oh, girl!

73
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,960
- Speak of the devil.
- What?

74
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,160
This is the midget version. This makes
me look like a trained professional.

75
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,360
Can we put this on the 5:00, please?

76
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,360
- Think I should ask him?
- No!

77
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,560
- I'm gonna ask him.
- No!

78
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,760
- I will.
- Audrey.

79
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,600
- Did you talk with Humphries?
- This is not the place.

80
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,040
- Tell me. Did you talk with him?
- He's considering you and Rodriguez.

81
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,920
You serious? He's gonna consider me
for the job? What else did he say?

82
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,840
Why don't we talk about it
over dinner tonight? Your place.

83
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,120
You're married.

84
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,560
Yes, and you're beautiful.
Have I told you before?

85
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,000
Mr. Caiman !

86
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,360
I've been doing research for you after
hours and weekends for over three years.

87
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,480
This is a very important job to me.

88
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,520
I'm too old to be your assistant. I need
to know this job is going someplace.

89
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,400
So, have dinner with me tonight.

90
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,840
I can't.

91
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,640
It's your choice.

92
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,080
- Okay, let's go.
- Charlie?

93
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,400
Say hello to your new co-anchor,
Ms. Desireé Pon.

94
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,040
Welcome aboard.

95
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,040
- Mark, can I have a pillow, something?
- In five. Four.

96
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,360
Three. Two.

97
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,360
Hello, New York. At 5:00 we'll ask
Fat Pat, "When will this rain end?"

98
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,480
So three years digging up worms
in Chernobyl?

99
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,520
How did Mrs. Tata-polis
handle that?

100
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,040
It's Tatopoulos.
I'm not married.

101
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,800
Really? A girlfriend?

102
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,360
No. Perhaps I work too much.

103
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,560
There's no one who holds
a special place in your heart?

104
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,520
No. Not for a long time now.

105
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,080
You may be the wrong man for the job...

106
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,360
but I think you're cute.

107
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,240
Oh. Thank you.

108
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,720
She thinks I'm cute.

109
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,080
Who are they?

110
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,160
Get those people out of there.

111
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,800
- They're with me.
- Is that right?

112
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,000
- Who are you?
- Casualty and Property Insurance.

113
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,920
- We're preparing our report.
- You're damn fast.

114
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,640
That's our job.

115
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,640
Your people are getting in the way
of my job.

116
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,640
What could've done this?

117
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,840
Mr. Roaché, get your people
out of here...

118
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,760
or I will.

119
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,480
- Captain's getting a cup of coffee.
- Don't take too long.

120
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,840
- Then he'll come and kick your ass.
- Yeah ! I'm in for a buck.

121
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,920
What is that dope-head doing?

122
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,680
Artie!

123
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,840
- Artie, why are we slowing down?
- I don't know. She's at full throttle.

124
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,560
Maybe she's heavy in the net.

125
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,880
Yo! How come we stopped?
Are the nets full?

126
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,560
I don't think so.
We must be caught on something.

127
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,840
Bring in the nets.
Pull 'em in now.

128
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,240
- What's going on?
- We're bringing them in !

129
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,680
The engines are heating.

130
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,760
- Should I shut them down?
- No! Keep pulling!

131
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,640
Come on! Bring 'em!

132
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,280
I'm trying. I'm trying!

133
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,320
Cut 'em loose! Cut the net!

134
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,880
Look out!

135
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,640
Cut loose now!

136
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,080
Hurry! Hurry!

137
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,200
Jump!

138
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,680
Abandon ship!

139
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,680
Let her go!

140
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,000
You hear that?

141
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,800
Excuse me, sir. Got a report
of three fishing trawlers going down.

142
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,880
- What makes you think it's related?
- The trawlers were pulled under, sir.

143
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,640
Jesus Christ!

144
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,560
It's 200 miles off the Eastern American
seaboard and we don't know what it is.

145
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,040
- It's Theropoda Allosarus.
- What?

146
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,000
Some type of enormous reptile we believe
died out in the Cretaceous Period.

147
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,240
Where's it been hiding
the last 60 million years?

148
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,280
What about the traces of radiation?

149
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,240
The radiation isn't an anomaly.
It's the clue.

150
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,480
This animal is much too big
to be some kind of lost dinosaur.

151
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,080
Don't tell me what it isn't,
tell me what it is.

152
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,480
What do we know?

153
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,120
It was first sighted...

154
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,080
off the French Polynesian Pacific,
right?

155
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,920
That area has been exposed to dozens
of nuclear tests over the past 30 years.

156
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,560
Hence the radiation.

157
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,440
No, more than that.
I believe this is a mutated aberration.

158
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,400
A hybrid caused by the fallout
on these islands.

159
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,320
Like your earthworms?

160
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,680
Yes. Yes.

161
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,000
We're looking at a completely
incipient creature.

162
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,600
The dawn of a new species.

163
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,800
The first of its kind.

164
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,920
My lite sucks.

165
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Oh, please! Your lite doesn't suck.

166
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,320
- His lite sucks.
- 'Cause I'm married to you.

167
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,360
I cannot believe he put the moves on me
after everything I've done for him.

168
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,240
He is scum! As far as he's concerned,
you're a pair of breasts that talk.

169
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,080
Hey, there's an image.

170
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,040
He is dirt!

171
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,920
He's a douche bag, gutter slime,
dog crap, puke chunks.

172
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,840
You don't see I'm eating?

173
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,600
Audrey, you're too damn nice.

174
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,760
That's your problem.
Nice gets you nothing in this town.

175
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,440
It's dog eat dog. You gotta be a killer
to get ahead. Know what I'm saying?

176
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,360
I'm sorry, baby,
but you just don't got what it takes.

177
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,400
- Do you think that's true, Animal?
- Pretty much.

178
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,480
You're a nice person.
Nice guys finish last.

179
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,680
- I can be tough if I want.
- Yeah, sure.

180
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,320
I can!

181
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,080
- I can.
- No, yeah.

182
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,320
Whatever.

183
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,120
Oh, my God!

184
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,440
Could you turn that up, please?

185
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,680
- It's Nick!
- Who is he?

186
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,680
He was my college sweetie.

187
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,760
He looks so handsome on TV.

188
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,280
There seems to be an unusually
tight security around the crash site...

189
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,280
possibly because of the highly sensitive
military cargo on the plane.

190
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,040
Fellas, you want to unload this, please?
I'm getting soaked!

191
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,960
Come on, will ya?

192
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,920
Joe, gonna catch one of them
little fish in the East River?

193
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,240
I hope so.

194
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,840
You never know.

195
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,960
I mean, today could be my lucky day.

196
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,400
The only thing you're gonna catch
is a cold!

197
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,480
I got a bite!

198
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,600
Boy, do I have a bite!

199
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,200
Hold on, Joe. You got a big one, baby.
Hold on to it now.

200
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,160
You wanna fight?

201
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,000
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen,
the man you've all been waiting for.

202
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,960
Yours for a safer New York.

203
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,240
Your mayor, Mayor Ebert!

204
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,920
Thank you!

205
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,600
I want to thank all of you for coming
on this beautiful New York City day!

206
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,840
When I first came into office
four years ago...

207
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,040
people didn't think
that I would reduce crime.

208
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,640
But I did!

209
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,640
Oh, my God!

210
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,680
Move it! Let's get out of here!

211
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,720
I am grateful
we're getting a new set.

212
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,920
It represents a commitment
on the part management.

213
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,280
What I don't understand
is why we're the only station...

214
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,520
that doesn't have
the Korean grocery holdup as our lead.

215
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,080
What's our lead?
Rain ! Again!

216
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,520
Mom?

217
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,400
Sorry. I don't give a rat's ass
about a war...

218
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,840
in some country whose name
I can't even pronounce!

219
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,160
How about a real story?

220
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,800
Sir, I think your story
just walked by the window.

221
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,720
What?

222
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,640
Maybe we can get in
the Korean grocer's hospital room.

223
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,280
Did this Romeo have a name?

224
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,880
Nick Tatopoulos.

225
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,000
- Jesus! Is that why you dumped him?
- No.

226
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,960
How long did you guys go out, anyway?

227
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,480
Nearly tour years.

228
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,880
Girl, I'm surprised
he didn't ask you to marry him.

229
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,040
That's the problem.

230
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,280
He did.

231
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,840
Tell me that's not another parade.

232
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,960
I don't think that's a parade.

233
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,560
Please stand by.

234
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,880
What the hell is that?

235
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,720
Are you all right?
Are you cut?

236
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,480
Victor!

237
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,600
- Don't be stupid!
- Oh, my!

238
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,520
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

239
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,360
That is really--
That is large.

240
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,120
Oh, my God!

241
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,040
Come on, you bastard!

242
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,680
Jeez!

243
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,040
Victor, get back here,
you retard!

244
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,680
Somebody do something!

245
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,760
Sergeant O'Neal, sir!

246
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,680
Any word from the mayor's office?

247
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,520
Yes, sir. They've agreed to evacuate the
city and called out the National Guard.

248
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,280
Wait. Evacuate Manhattan?
That's over three million people.

249
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,560
- Has that been done before?
- I don't think so.

250
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,440
- Where is he now?
- We lost sight of it, sir.

251
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,680
You want to run that by me again?

252
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,240
After its initial attack...

253
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,800
he disappeared.

254
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,680
Secretary of Defense Burk
is on the line.

255
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,240
I don't understand. How could
something so big just disappear?

256
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,760
- We're not sure, but we're scanning--
- He probably returned to the river.

257
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,800
I don't think so.
I mean, look at it.

258
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,760
It's perfect.

259
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:52,200
An island, water on all sides,
but like no other island in the world.

260
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,520
This is a place
where he can easily hide.

261
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,280
He's in there someplace.

262
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,040
Channel 12 caught it on tape.

263
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Hello. I'm Charles Caiman
in the WIDF News Center.

264
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,400
Ladies and gentlemen,
we New Yorkers like to think...

265
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,480
we've seen it all, but what you
will see will shock you beyond belief.

266
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,560
This is footage we have
that indicates...

267
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,680
that there is a dinosaur loose
in Manhattan.

268
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,400
WIDF's exclusive footage
was shot barely half an hour ago.

269
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,080
WIDF cameraman Victor "Animal" Palotti
survived unharmed.

270
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,600
Great stuff, Animal.
Weren't you scared?

271
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,880
Yeah. Thought Lucy was gonna kill me.

272
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,880
Damn right, you crazy wop!

273
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,320
Okay, people, we have to be
completely relocated...

274
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,800
to the New Jersey station
for the 10:00 broadcast.

275
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,040
Animal!

276
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,280
You're riding in the chopper
with Caiman. Let's go. Lift off.

277
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,360
You going to be all right?

278
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,640
Audrey's going
to spend the night with us.

279
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,200
Cool. A threesome. That's excellent.

280
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,320
I'm a little tired--

281
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,160
Dozens of people are reported killed,
thousands of others injured.

282
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,040
Civil defense stations
are being set up throughout Manhattan.

283
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,000
In addition, city, military...

284
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,400
and health officials
are setting up a command post...

285
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,920
on the Jersey shore
in anticipation of an evacuation.

286
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,280
My bag. My bag!

287
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,960
Mr. Caiman, wait.

288
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,000
I've got a lead.

289
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,760
- I know a guy who's on the inside.
- Not now.

290
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,240
You don't understand.
I can get us inside information.

291
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,400
This is when the big boys go to work.
Okay, honey? Bag.

292
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,680
This is crazy! Come on, let's go.

293
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,480
Wait up.

294
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,640
- Can we get a cab?
- Audrey, what are you thinking?

295
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,280
Go, go!

296
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,680
In what city officials are describing
as the worst act of destruction...

297
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,720
since the World Trade Center bombing...

298
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,960
hundreds of thousands of people
have jammed the streets...

299
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
in the largest evacuation
in this city's history.

300
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,320
And many people, many, many people
are not happy about it.

301
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,120
Among those unhappy citizens
are the managers of the stores...

302
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,680
along pricey Fifth and Madison Avenue.

303
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,360
The Warner Bros. and Disney stores
have been cleared out by looters.

304
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,960
And the streets are jammed.
Traffic is at a standstill.

305
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,760
Emergency vehicles cannot have access
to any emergency that may develop.

306
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,880
And there is a slow but steady stream
out of the city...

307
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,160
as if Long Island or New Jersey
were any refuge in this time of crisis.

308
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,520
This is great!

309
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,400
If I'm wrong on this evacuation, they'll
string me up from the Liberty torch.

310
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,240
Didn't we agree that we weren't to have
any sweets until after the election?

311
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,400
Back off, Gene.

312
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,160
- Mr. Mayor.
- Who are they?

313
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,320
Building owners and business people
from the community.

314
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,720
- I don't have time for this nonsense.
- Campaign contributors!

315
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,640
Ladies and gentlemen,
I share your concerns.

316
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,720
I want to get this city back in business
as soon as possible. Please.

317
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:35,200
La Rochelle Insurance. We represent
13%% of the buildings in your city.

318
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,920
You can count on our emotional
and financial support.

319
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,120
Thank you.

320
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,480
What do you plan to do?

321
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,360
- Coming through.
- Where's your I.D.?

322
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,640
- What's the matter?
- You need press I.D.

323
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,600
I've got l. D.
I had a badge on my bag.

324
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,520
I don't know if this is a good idea.

325
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,880
What are you talking about?
You stole it.

326
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,800
Finally you got a little chutzpah.
Don't wimp out on me.

327
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,040
What if Caiman finds out?

328
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,640
How often will you have an ex-boyfriend
on the inside of a major story?

329
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,080
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

330
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,720
If I could just stick this thing.

331
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,080
You got any glue?

332
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,440
I'm sorry. I left my forgery kit
at the office.

333
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,400
No croissant?

334
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,480
Ah, you call this coffee?

335
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,480
I call this America.

336
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,680
I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor,
but that's where we are.

337
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,600
Now hold on. Hold on.

338
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,720
You're saying that in an election month
I've evacuated this city for nothing?

339
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,520
Do you realize what this evacuation
will cost the people of this city?

340
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,800
We have been monitoring the waters
around the island.

341
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,960
- As far as we can tell, it hasn't left.
- But you don't know for sure.

342
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,400
We have a strong reason to believe
it may be hiding...

343
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,720
inside one of the buildings
within the restricted area.

344
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,920
- But you don't know for sure!
- Mr. Mayor.

345
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,080
We cannot give the "all clear"
until each building has been checked.

346
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,160
- What is it?
- Excuse me, sir.

347
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,520
That may be more difficult
than we originally projected.

348
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,680
Terrific! More good news.

349
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,520
We've run into a problem.

350
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,960
- Do you believe this?
- I don't know what's going on.

351
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,000
- You never know what's going on.
- Thank you.

352
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,320
- Here, sir.
- Fall in.

353
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,920
Let's go, people.
Fall in downstairs.

354
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,040
Lieutenant Anderson and his men
found this this afternoon.

355
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,520
We were checking the office building
above when we found the floor was gone.

356
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,000
When we discovered he could burrow
through the tunnels, we realized...

357
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,440
he could be outside
the quarantine zone.

358
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,640
Holy Christ!
How many tunnels lead off the island?

359
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,240
Only 14. We've checked them all.
He hasn't used any of them.

360
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,880
- Have them all sealed up.
- Yes, sir.

361
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,600
How? How would we do that, sir?

362
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,360
Fill them with cement. Brick them up.
Put land mines in them, bombs.

363
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,520
I don't care! Make sure the damn thing
doesn't leave the island!

364
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,320
Yes, sir.

365
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,000
You know, he's not some enemy
trying to evade you.

366
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,760
- He's just an animal.
- What are you suggesting?

367
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,160
When I had to catch earthworms...

368
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,800
the best way to get them was not
to dig them out, but to draw them out.

369
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,200
All we need to do
is to find out what he needs...

370
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,000
and he'll come to you.

371
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,480
Where are they now?

372
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,920
Delta Niner, what is convoy position?

373
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,080
Command, they have
just entered the city.

374
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,000
I have no radio contact with the convoy.
I'm expecting ground confirmation now.

375
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,800
- Convoy ETA ten minutes, sir.
- We've got to hurry.

376
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,120
Man your positions now.
Ten minutes to ETA.

377
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,760
Go, go, go!
All systems go!

378
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,800
Is it good?

379
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
Let's go! Come on, coming through!

380
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,840
Put it down.

381
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,200
You said this was French Roast!

382
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,720
More cream.

383
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,280
Bring 'em in!

384
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,960
Bring 'em back.

385
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,480
I hope this plan of yours works.

386
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,720
I'm hoping that myself.

387
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,480
- Did you give approval for this?
- They just appropriated it.

388
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,560
Twelve city dump trucks? Would you like
to tell me what's going on?

389
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,080
Actually, no, I wouldn't.
And don't touch anything.

390
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,000
- How's O'Neal doing?
- Everything is on schedule.

391
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,760
- You sure you didn't know about this?
- No one told me anything.

392
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,760
Why do I keep you around?

393
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,200
Dump!

394
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,080
Very clever.

395
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,720
Let's pile it on
and let's get out of here.

396
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,240
That's a lot of fish.

397
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,000
Come on, you bastard,
it's supper time.

398
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,400
Look at all that frigging fish.
Is this gonna work?

399
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,520
We gotta get these manholes uncovered.

400
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,840
We want him to smell the bait.

401
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,320
Come on !

402
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,880
Let's go! Let's go!

403
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,040
Come on, guys.

404
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,800
Get those lids off. Go!

405
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,120
What the hell is he doing?

406
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,800
Okay, this way.

407
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,720
- Come on.
- You heard him. Let's go.

408
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,720
Come on! Over there!

409
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,080
This one.

410
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,920
Give me the crowbar.

411
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,280
Set up here.
It's your best shot.

412
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,320
This is 6-Alpha Charlie.
We can't stay put!

413
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,440
We gotta move!

414
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,120
We need bigger guns.

415
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,200
- We've lost communications.
- Get us back on-line.

416
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,800
Fire at will !

417
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,840
- Fire at will.
- Fire, fire!

418
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,680
O'Neal, what the hell
is going on?

419
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,440
He's gone, sir.
Echo unit in pursuit.

420
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,040
Follow my lead.

421
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,440
- All systems armed.
- Echo 4 armed.

422
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,920
We're doing 80 knots,
and he's pulling away, sir.

423
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,360
I've got him locked on.

424
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,520
- Target is locked on, sir.
- Fire the damn missile.

425
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,640
- Echo, fire at will.
- Fire sidewinders.

426
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,880
Damn!

427
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,160
That is a negative impact.
I repeat, that is a negative impact.

428
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,360
- Negative impact, sir.
- Negative impact?

429
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,840
That's the goddamn Chrysler Building.

430
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,680
He had it locked on.

431
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,280
We had you locked on.

432
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,640
The heat seekers can't lock, sir.
He's colder than the buildings.

433
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,960
Freddie!

434
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,000
- What?
- Let's go before we get caught.

435
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,400
Jimmy, you know that bad feeling I get
when something bad is going to happen?

436
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,840
- Yeah.
- I'm getting that feeling right now.

437
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:18,360
Descend to 300 feet.
All systems armed.

438
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,960
Descend to 300 feet.
All systems armed.

439
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,080
Target, 11 :00.

440
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,520
Where'd he go?

441
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,360
Echo Flight, get it together, guys.
Prepare to fire.

442
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,200
Echo 4, ready.

443
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,760
Echo 2, ready.

444
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,920
Fire!

445
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,120
I think we got him.

446
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,040
- We've lost Echo 1 and 2, sir.
- God!

447
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,960
Echo 4, where is target?

448
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,640
Jesus! He's right on my tail, sir!

449
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,080
I can't shake him!

450
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,320
Oh, I think I lost him.

451
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,200
We've lost Echo 4, sir.

452
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,840
What the hell is the matter with you?

453
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,960
You've caused more damage
than that goddamn thing did!

454
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,400
-Calm down. Have some candy.
-I don't want any candy! Leave me alone.

455
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,920
I can't believe it.

456
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:00,840
He did all of this
and we did nothing to him.

457
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,960
That's not true.

458
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,440
We fed him.

459
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,560
Here at Command Center in New Jersey
there is no new information to report...

460
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,960
because the military has clamped
a total media blackout...

461
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,080
on whatever is going on
out here.

462
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,640
Officials are not saying anything
about their attempts to contain...

463
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,880
or control this creature.

464
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,760
Okay, the situation is under control !

465
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,680
It is under control.
We have containment.

466
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,240
Don't wait for me. I'm okay.

467
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,000
- Can I help you, young man?
- Yes.

468
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,800
Do you have any
at-home pregnancy tests?

469
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,920
Especially ones that look
for gonadotrophic hormones...

470
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,920
or clomiphene citrate?

471
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,480
I don't know.

472
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,000
This is all we've got.

473
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,400
I'll take all of them.

474
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,200
You must have some harem.

475
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,040
Oh, my God. Is that you?
What are you doing here?

476
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,520
Hi. Hello.

477
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,160
- Wow. How much is that?
- $46.

478
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,280
God, you look-- Wow!

479
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,240
- How have you been?
- It's good to see you, Nick.

480
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,800
- So you made it.
- What?

481
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,880
You're a reporter.

482
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,240
That's good.
That's what you always wanted.

483
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,160
I'm happy for you.

484
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,160
Really. I am.

485
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,160
Thank you.

486
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,600
You're still mad at me?

487
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:57,120
Well, you left without a phone call,
letter, nothing, all this time.

488
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,960
Yeah. I guess I am
still a little mad.

489
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,720
That was eight years ago.
Some people change.

490
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,880
Most people don't.

491
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,160
I'm sorry you feel that way.

492
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,000
You're right.
Eight years is a long time.

493
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,920
Can I make you a cup of tea?

494
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,720
Sure. That'd be nice.

495
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,000
I still can't believe it.

496
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,800
How does a guy go
from anti-nuke activist...

497
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,280
to working for
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?

498
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:46,080
When you and I went
to rallies together in college...

499
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,240
we helped to create awareness.

500
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,920
But now, from the inside...

501
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,920
I'm able to effect real change.

502
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,240
And exactly what changes
are you trying to effect?

503
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,960
I'm preparing a census
for the government.

504
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,880
I'm cataloging new species created
as a result of nuclear contamination.

505
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,680
- Is that what you think created this?
- Yeah. I found a blood sample earlier.

506
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,400
- How close did you get to the thing?
- I got pretty close.

507
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,600
What else did you find out?

508
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,600
We know he eats tons of fish.

509
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,960
He's amphibious.
He's a burrower.

510
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,280
And...

511
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,120
he's pregnant.

512
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,880
He is?

513
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,760
He! A very unusual he.

514
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,360
Obviously these tests
weren't designed for this...

515
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,320
but fundamentally they look for the same
hormonal patterns to indicate pregnancy.

516
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,080
I don't get it. It he's the first
of his kind, how can he be pregnant?

517
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,000
Doesn't he need a mate?

518
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,040
Not if he reproduces asexually.

519
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,880
Where's the fun in that?

520
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:04,880
I kept thinking,
why would he travel so tar?

521
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,960
But it makes perfect sense.

522
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:11,360
Lots of animals travel
great distances for reproduction.

523
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,360
That's what he's doing in New York.
He's nesting.

524
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,880
- Nesting?
- Yes.

525
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,480
Do you realize
that a lizard can lay...

526
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,920
up to 12 eggs at a time?

527
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,480
- Think of it.
- I didn't know that.

528
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,480
Forgive me.
I have to get this to the lab...

529
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,800
see it I can confirm all this.

530
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,080
I'll be right back.

531
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,840
Come on, Joey.
There's nothing down here.

532
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,120
I'm telling you, man,
I heard something.

533
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,800
You heard nothing.
It's a dead end.

534
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,640
Anything?

535
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,480
No. Nothing down here.

536
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,320
Nothing at all.

537
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,760
This is why, in this case, all the
king's horses and all the king's men...

538
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,480
may not be able to put
the Big Apple together again.

539
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,640
Audrey Timmonds. WIDF News.

540
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,840
- Yes!
- That's it. You owe me a beer.

541
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,960
You like it?
I should've worn my hair back.

542
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,120
- No, it looks great.
- You liked it? Good.

543
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,320
Can I ask you something?
How did you get ahold of this material?

544
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,120
It's like you said.

545
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,280
"Nice guys finish last."

546
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,920
- Thank you. I love you.
- Yeah, sure.

547
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,680
Murray!

548
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,880
Come here a second.

549
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,080
Hold on a second?
What is it?

550
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,120
I've got exclusive footage
of other places this thing has attacked.

551
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,160
You do?
Whose story is that?

552
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,160
Mine.

553
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,920
If we can lure him into a more open area
such as this portion of Central Park...

554
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,840
I think we can take him down.

555
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:25,240
Last time you didn't even scratch it.

556
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:30,800
That's not true. Our worm guy,
I mean Dr. Tatopoulos, has found blood.

557
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,160
Yes, I did.

558
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,360
We need to get him out
into open terrain...

559
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,600
and use weapons that don't rely
on heat-seeking technology--

560
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:43,880
Excuse me, sir. I think this situation
has become more complicated than that.

561
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,840
The blood that I collected...

562
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,800
revealed that the creature is either
about to lay eggs or already has.

563
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,600
Are you trying to tell us that there's
another one of those things out there?

564
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,000
No, Governor.
I don't believe so.

565
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,680
Wait a minute.

566
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,960
Then how can it be pregnant?

567
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,920
What is this, the virgin lizard?

568
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,000
No. It reproduces asexually.

569
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,000
That's why we have to find the nest
as soon as possible.

570
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,640
Otherwise up to a dozen
are going to be born...

571
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:16,280
each one capable of laying eggs
on its own.

572
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,640
Very quickly we could be looking at
an enormous population.

573
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,880
After we kill the creature,
then we'll search for the nest.

574
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:26,440
I think it might be too late by then.
These eggs will hatch very quickly.

575
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,240
How do you know?

576
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:32,160
The fish that we found
on the subway.

577
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,400
He's not collecting all this food
just for himself.

578
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,680
He's preparing to teed his young.

579
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,920
Stay tuned for our special report.

580
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,200
Would you excuse us, please?
Where you been?

581
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,160
They just promo-ed your spot.
It's up right after this.

582
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,360
Turn it up?

583
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,360
Yo! Can you turn it up, please?
The TV!

584
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,160
If Dr. Tatopoulos is right, we must act
quickly before this problem escalates.

585
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:16,360
So you want to divide our efforts
based solely on some wild theory?

586
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,480
Sir, Nick's come through for us before.
If he feels--

587
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,560
Come through for you?
Colonel, your campaign's a disaster.

588
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,280
You weren't even able to keep this thing
from coming to Manhattan.

589
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,040
Excuse me, gentlemen,
but I think we should see this.

590
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:32,640
Look at the methods and motivations
of Manhattan's newest unwanted pest.

591
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,720
Godzilla.

592
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,360
That's what Japanese sailors
called him in song.

593
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,960
A mythological sea dragon
who filled their hearts with fear.

594
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,040
- He stole my report!
- I know.

595
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,240
That myth has become reality,
our modern-day terror.

596
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,960
I don't believe it!

597
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:56,120
Who is this Godzilla?
Where did he come from? Why is he here?

598
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,520
And it's Gojira, you moron !

599
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,200
A direct path can be traced
from Manhattan to French Polynesia...

600
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,600
where nuclear tests have been going on
for more than two decades.

601
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,480
Research team member
Dr. Nick Papadopoulus believes....

602
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,760
the creature may be nesting...

603
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,280
using Manhattan as ground zero
to cultivate the species.

604
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,400
This despite the fact
that the combined might...

605
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:18,800
of the United States military
has been unable to subdue--

606
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,800
You went to the press with this?

607
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,000
- No! I haven't talked to anyone.
- They mentioned you by name!

608
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,600
Yeah. Yeah !

609
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,840
You gave them the tape?

610
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:32,160
No, I didn't give them the tape.
It's in my tent right now.

611
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,240
Oh, my God! She took it.

612
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,240
Pack your stuff, mister. You're
officially off this project as of now!

613
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:00,290
We're leaving.

614
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:08,570
I'm so sorry.

615
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:17,210
Make sure that Hicks finds that nest
before it's too late.

616
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:19,770
I'll try.

617
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:35,050
He's not there? A second ago
you told me he was on the other line.

618
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:38,690
Please. It's urgent. I really need
to talk to him. Yes, Nick Tatopoulos.

619
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,490
You're leaving?

620
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,610
Why?

621
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:58,770
Is it 'cause of me?
'Cause of the story?

622
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:01,450
What did you think
was going to happen?

623
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:03,850
You never said it was off the record.

624
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:09,930
I shouldn't have to. You were supposed
to be my friend. I trusted you.

625
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:16,850
There's something I have to tell you.

626
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:19,090
I lied to you.

627
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:21,570
I'm not a reporter.

628
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:29,090
When we broke up,
and I first came out to New York...

629
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:31,370
I was so sure I'd make it.

630
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:33,770
But I haven't.

631
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:36,250
That's why I needed the story so bad.

632
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:39,810
I couldn't tell you
I'm a failure.

633
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:49,570
And you thought that made it okay
to steal my tapes?

634
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:53,010
It was a terrible thing to do.
I never should've done that.

635
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:01,010
Good luck with your new career.

636
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,810
I really think you have
what it takes.

637
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:05,450
Newark Airport.

638
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:16,770
I'm sorry.

639
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:23,650
Yo! Give her a break, will ya?

640
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:54,050
Excuse me, is this the best way
to the airport?

641
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:00,970
Sir, where are you going?

642
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:03,770
Hello?

643
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:08,330
Okay, stop.

644
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:10,370
Stop the car right now!

645
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:13,290
Let me out of here!

646
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:17,890
I'm afraid I can't do that.

647
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,170
I know you, don't l?

648
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:26,010
Yeah, you're that insurance guy.

649
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:29,850
Agent Philippe Roaché, D.G.S. E.

650
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:32,490
Direction Générale
des Securité Extérieure.

651
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:34,170
Sounds big.

652
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:38,130
The French Secret Service.

653
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:45,770
Your American friends have decided
not to look for the creature's nest.

654
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:49,370
What? Are you sure?
How do you know that?

655
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:52,330
- We know. Trust me.
- Trust you?

656
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:55,490
You hijack me and you expect me
to trust you?

657
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:57,730
- Yes.
- Why should l?

658
01:07:57,810 --> 01:08:03,050
Because you are the only one who wants
to find the nest as much as I do.

659
01:08:29,530 --> 01:08:31,890
How did you get all this stuff
into the country?

660
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:34,330
This is America.
We can buy anything.

661
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:39,130
Why all the secrecy? Why aren't you
working with the U.S. military?

662
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:43,090
I'm not permitted
to speak of such things.

663
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:45,770
You said you needed my trust.
Then I need yours.

664
01:08:49,530 --> 01:08:52,450
I am a patriot. I love my country.
You understand that?

665
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:53,930
Sure.

666
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:56,130
It is my job to protect my country.

667
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:59,050
Sometimes I must even protect it
from itself...

668
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:01,010
from mistakes we've made.

669
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:03,690
Mistakes we don't want the world
to know about.

670
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:06,770
- The nuclear tests in the Pacific?
- Yes.

671
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:10,410
This testing done by my country
left a terrible mess.

672
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:12,530
We're here to clean it up.

673
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:28,850
We know how to get into the city.

674
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:31,250
We just don't know where
to start looking.

675
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:41,610
Here. This is the 23rd Street
subway station.

676
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:44,770
That's where we first found the fish.
That'd be a good place to start.

677
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:46,450
So you're in?

678
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:52,290
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

679
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:58,450
I always wanted to join
the French Foreign Legion.

680
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:11,850
- Hello.
- How's it going?

681
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:21,570
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Sorry.

682
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,770
- Honey?
- Hi, sweetie.

683
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:26,730
- Who are all these people?
- What?

684
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:29,610
I couldn't just let them
sleep on the street.

685
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,170
Where's Audrey?

686
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:38,010
In the bedroom crying her eyes out
because of you.

687
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:39,410
What did I do?

688
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:42,170
That "you gotta be vicious" stuff
you tilled her head with.

689
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:45,290
- Get out of here!
- Go talk to her right now.

690
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:47,490
I was agreeing with you.
Excuse me.

691
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:49,570
Contrary to frivolous reporting...

692
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:53,810
we have absolutely no information
whatsoever to make us believe...

693
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:56,690
that there are any eggs of the creature
in the city.

694
01:10:56,770 --> 01:11:00,890
There's no need for panic.
Repeat. There's no reason to panic.

695
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:05,410
It's all my fault.

696
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:09,850
What have I done?
What have I become?

697
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:13,650
Look at me. This isn't me.
I don't do stuff like this.

698
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:15,850
You made a mistake. It happens.

699
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:22,370
Well, I totally screwed up with the
only man who will ever care about me.

700
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:24,730
If I told you you could make it all up,
would you?

701
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:26,330
Of course I would.

702
01:11:26,410 --> 01:11:28,130
So get this.

703
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:32,130
After he left you in the street,
I kinda followed him.

704
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:34,850
Figured I'd talk some sense
into the guy, you know?

705
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:37,370
Next thing I know,
he pulls into this warehouse...

706
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:40,450
with all these French wackos
in military outfits.

707
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:43,650
They want to sneak back
into the city tonight.

708
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:45,610
They're going after the nest.

709
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:48,970
If he finds it, I think you should be
the one that lets the world know...

710
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:50,890
that this guy was right all along.

711
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:53,890
You want me to follow him
into the city?

712
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:56,930
Yeah. We both will.

713
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,890
Come on. It'll be fun.

714
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:02,570
I don't know. I've already made
such a mess of everything.

715
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:05,010
Yeah, you did, Audrey.
I'm goin' after him.

716
01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:08,170
You can come with me or not. Okay?

717
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:13,250
What are you doing?

718
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:16,370
Can't let Lucy know.
She'll hurt me.

719
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:35,530
What's with the gum?

720
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:38,890
Makes us look more American.

721
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:40,930
Really?

722
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:46,770
Just let me do the talking.
All right?

723
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:52,690
It's not in gear.

724
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:03,730
Follow me. This way.

725
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:10,090
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

726
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:22,090
- Come on.
- What is this place?

727
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:25,250
It's a vent that leads to
the subway tunnels underneath here.

728
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:28,410
It should take us to
the 23rd Street station in Manhattan.

729
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:34,450
You've got to be kidding me.
Aren't there rats and stuff down here?

730
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:37,530
I'm more concerned about lizards
at this point.

731
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:40,410
Big, ugly, nasty, large lizards.

732
01:13:57,170 --> 01:13:58,570
Who you with?

733
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:03,250
We're with the 3-2, sir.

734
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:05,490
I didn't ask you, soldier!

735
01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:07,970
Sergeant O'Neal just called down for us.

736
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:10,410
He wants us to join him now, sir.
Thank you.

737
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:16,930
- You got a problem talkin'?
- No, sir. I'm tine.

738
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:19,930
Let's go!

739
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:22,730
Keep it movin'.

740
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:25,050
Thank you very much.

741
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:34,490
Elvis Presley movies.
He was the King.

742
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:41,530
Sir, O'Neal on-line.

743
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,090
Do you read me?

744
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:47,810
Call for O'Neal!

745
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:49,650
How are we doing?

746
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:53,090
So tar so good.
We're right on schedule.

747
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:55,890
We're good.

748
01:14:57,290 --> 01:14:58,690
We're good.

749
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:15,490
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah. There they are.

750
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:18,090
Kill your light.

751
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:22,210
How do we get down there?
We're gonna lose them.

752
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:34,570
- How did they get down there?
- I don't know.

753
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:38,210
You don't think
they climbed down this thing?

754
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,650
Jesus!

755
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:57,290
Careful.

756
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:04,770
- Gimme your hand.
- I got you.

757
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:08,810
The gutter.

758
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:18,810
- Do you hear that?
- What?

759
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:01,850
Animal, come on!

760
01:17:39,690 --> 01:17:42,130
I guess we go this way.

761
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:02,890
Sir, we spotted him in section 5.

762
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:07,370
Combat positions! Here we go.
Combat!

763
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:14,770
Target's heading north
to section 5.

764
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:19,050
Do not fire until he has cleared
the buildings and enters the park.

765
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:44,770
Wait until he enters the park.

766
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:01,010
Come on.

767
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:07,850
He's leaving!

768
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:10,050
Fire away!

769
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:18,570
Damn!

770
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:31,170
Fire!

771
01:20:36,490 --> 01:20:37,890
Raven Flight. Evasive maneuvers.

772
01:20:45,370 --> 01:20:48,770
Target is in the clear. He's headed
toward the Westside Highway.

773
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:08,650
Don't worry. The navy
has something waiting for him.

774
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:19,290
- Stations manned for battle station.
- At ordered depth, sir.

775
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:22,130
We've got him on sonar.
Utah closing in.

776
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:24,050
Make final preparations.
Prepare to fire.

777
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:33,970
Manned and ready.

778
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:35,930
Torpedo room reports
manned and ready.

779
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:38,730
- Final bearing in chute.
- Are we locked on?

780
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:41,570
- Are we locked on?
- Aye, sir.

781
01:21:41,650 --> 01:21:44,290
- Locked on, Captain.
- Number one, stand by. Fire.

782
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:47,170
Torpedo 1 left the tube.

783
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:01,250
Indiana and Anchorage closing in.

784
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:04,330
- What's the status?
- We're locked on and closing in.

785
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:05,610
Fire one.

786
01:22:26,930 --> 01:22:29,930
- The target's heading right at us!
- All back full.

787
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:32,650
Aye, sir. All back full.

788
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:42,570
Stand by for impact in ten seconds.

789
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:48,530
Six. Five.

790
01:22:49,610 --> 01:22:51,250
Four. Three.

791
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:53,490
Two. One.

792
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:14,650
We've lost the Anchorage, sir.

793
01:23:23,690 --> 01:23:26,490
He's shitted course.
He's heading back towards Manhattan.

794
01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:28,570
Full ahead. Close in and lock on.

795
01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:31,650
Prepare tubes 3 and 4 and lock on.

796
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:42,210
- Stand by, 3. Fire.
- Torpedo 3 left the tube.

797
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:51,810
Impact in eight seconds.
Seven. Six.

798
01:23:57,410 --> 01:24:00,490
Three. Two. One.

799
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,610
- Direct hit!
- Got him.

800
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:12,570
Congratulations, sir.

801
01:24:12,610 --> 01:24:14,050
Good job.

802
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:16,170
Well done.

803
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:18,770
Good job.

804
01:24:55,610 --> 01:24:57,130
What's up there?

805
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:21,970
This is a good smell.

806
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:23,410
Yeah.

807
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:28,570
Look at this.
He trashed the Garden.

808
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:31,970
Oh, man!
Now I'm pissed.

809
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:35,050
Is that them?

810
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,490
Yeah.

811
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:12,770
Three eggs.

812
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:14,890
I thought there'd be more.

813
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,890
And you were right.

814
01:26:28,330 --> 01:26:31,290
Oh my! Wow!

815
01:26:32,650 --> 01:26:35,010
There's gotta be more
than 20 eggs here.

816
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:37,410
Way more!

817
01:26:56,370 --> 01:26:57,770
Start counting.

818
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:13,210
- Could you help me?
- You all right?

819
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:51,490
What the hell are they doing?

820
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:27,930
We have a problem.

821
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:05,290
Oh, my God! God!

822
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:07,370
Come on, let's go.

823
01:29:07,450 --> 01:29:10,930
One second, all right?
This is unbelievable.

824
01:29:23,890 --> 01:29:27,770
- Don't we have enough already?
- I just want--

825
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:35,650
That's good for me.
That's plenty.

826
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:40,770
We should-- Let's--

827
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:51,850
Let's not startle him.

828
01:30:00,170 --> 01:30:02,650
We smell like the fish.

829
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:05,530
- I think we should leave now.
- I think that's a good idea.

830
01:30:30,970 --> 01:30:33,130
Run! Come on!

831
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:42,850
- Everybody outside now!
- Come on, quickly!

832
01:30:58,050 --> 01:31:01,850
Lock the doors now!
We have to keep them contained inside.

833
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:03,810
Come on, let's go!

834
01:32:02,290 --> 01:32:04,410
- You see that?
- On three.

835
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:06,770
Three!

836
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:20,570
This is where the Knicks
get showered and everything.

837
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:30,170
Now what do we do?

838
01:32:31,970 --> 01:32:35,650
I'm standing just outside the
Jersey entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel...

839
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:39,970
where thousands of angry refugees are
demanding to be let back into the city.

840
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:45,050
All major arteries into the city
are clogged with jubilant Manhattanites.

841
01:32:45,090 --> 01:32:47,210
Yes, I understand.

842
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:50,570
- Your office is swamped with calls.
- I know.

843
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:53,810
Do you have any idea what's going on out
there? Phones are ringing off the hook.

844
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:56,090
People are screaming
to be let back into the city.

845
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:58,370
We're sending divers in
to retrieve the body.

846
01:32:58,410 --> 01:33:00,330
What are you waiting for?

847
01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:03,850
Colonel, we've got to start a search
for the nest.

848
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:05,810
We've been through this already.

849
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:08,170
What if Nick is right
and we blow this whole thing?

850
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:11,210
This could be the only chance we have
to do something about it.

851
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:17,610
Captain, organize a search party.

852
01:33:17,690 --> 01:33:19,930
I want a sweep of the entire city
and the subway.

853
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:22,410
You don't have the authority
to do that.

854
01:33:22,490 --> 01:33:24,850
Try and stop me.

855
01:33:36,090 --> 01:33:37,610
Contact the military.

856
01:33:37,690 --> 01:33:40,610
Get them to send a bomber
to blow up this building.

857
01:33:40,690 --> 01:33:44,890
- How do I do that?
- 555-7600.

858
01:33:44,970 --> 01:33:48,330
Tell them it's a Code Dragonfly.
That should get you through.

859
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:51,850
What are you waiting for?

860
01:33:51,930 --> 01:33:54,330
- 555 what?
- 7600.

861
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:04,170
- All circuits are busy right now.
- It's busy.

862
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:05,410
Try again!

863
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:16,970
What did they say?

864
01:34:18,410 --> 01:34:21,050
I can't get through.
I don't know what's wrong.

865
01:34:23,370 --> 01:34:25,250
We secured the doors.

866
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:28,970
- Where is Jean-Philippe, Jean-Pierre?
- They didn't make it.

867
01:34:32,730 --> 01:34:36,170
My men and I will hold them here.
You'll have to go and get help.

868
01:34:54,090 --> 01:34:56,690
Can we tit up there?

869
01:34:57,930 --> 01:35:00,090
Only one way to find out.

870
01:35:01,410 --> 01:35:03,490
Boost me up.

871
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:12,690
This is not good.

872
01:37:26,170 --> 01:37:27,290
Come on.

873
01:37:31,970 --> 01:37:33,370
Come on.

874
01:38:00,970 --> 01:38:02,530
Wrong floor.

875
01:38:11,650 --> 01:38:13,770
Why don't we go this way?

876
01:38:34,970 --> 01:38:37,890
- It's me. It's me.
- What happened?

877
01:38:37,970 --> 01:38:40,890
They're loose. They're all over
the place. I couldn't get out.

878
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:49,730
- Who are you?
- Audrey!

879
01:38:51,490 --> 01:38:52,850
Here.

880
01:38:55,810 --> 01:38:57,730
- You all right?
- I think so.

881
01:38:57,770 --> 01:38:59,770
No cameras.

882
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:01,850
Yeah, all right.
Very good.

883
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:06,450
Do you have a radio, walkie-talkie,
anything to contact the outside?

884
01:39:06,530 --> 01:39:09,690
- What about the phones?
- It's no good. Circuits are jammed.

885
01:39:09,770 --> 01:39:14,010
Wait. I know a way. I know how
we can get a message to the outside.

886
01:39:22,090 --> 01:39:23,490
This way.

887
01:39:26,530 --> 01:39:27,890
The tape!

888
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:36,450
Come on !

889
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:51,970
Come on.

890
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:54,890
- The broadcast booth is over here.
- How do you know that?

891
01:39:54,970 --> 01:39:57,490
Our network covers the Rangers games.

892
01:39:59,490 --> 01:40:01,850
- It's locked.
- Wait. There's a code.

893
01:40:03,450 --> 01:40:04,810
Come on !

894
01:40:09,930 --> 01:40:11,810
I was just about to get it.

895
01:40:11,850 --> 01:40:15,330
The network is on an intranet. It's
a direct teed into our computer system.

896
01:40:15,410 --> 01:40:19,450
Your station won't have an easier time
reaching the military than I did.

897
01:40:19,490 --> 01:40:21,770
Did they monitor
all the news broadcasts?

898
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:23,730
Yeah, they did.

899
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:27,090
All right, we'll go live.
We'll broadcast right from in here.

900
01:40:27,810 --> 01:40:30,330
Hopefully they'll see it.

901
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:33,450
I'll try to get a message through.

902
01:40:43,970 --> 01:40:46,330
Let's not forget in our rush
to return to the city...

903
01:40:46,410 --> 01:40:49,010
that many people have had their lives
changed forever.

904
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:52,410
No one in the city has been untouched
by the tragedy.

905
01:40:52,490 --> 01:40:56,650
The sick, the displaced,
the injured--

906
01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:02,970
There's no Ranger game on tonight.

907
01:41:06,170 --> 01:41:09,210
Ed, if you're seeing this,
will you please put us on live?

908
01:41:09,290 --> 01:41:11,170
It's urgent.

909
01:41:11,210 --> 01:41:14,010
I know this sounds crazy,
but you have to do it.

910
01:41:16,090 --> 01:41:17,370
Trust me.

911
01:41:18,210 --> 01:41:20,090
I'm not putting you on live.

912
01:41:20,130 --> 01:41:23,010
- I don't think he'll do it.
- Yes, he will.

913
01:41:23,970 --> 01:41:26,170
All right, Ed? Come on!

914
01:41:29,410 --> 01:41:32,090
See that? They'll be all over the city
if we don't stop them.

915
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:35,850
Give me a second.

916
01:41:41,450 --> 01:41:45,210
The time has come to return
to our homes and pick up our lives.

917
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:48,210
- These are the last three.
- Our fears have been allayed.

918
01:41:48,290 --> 01:41:51,610
Thanks to the heroic efforts
of our boys in uniform--

919
01:41:51,650 --> 01:41:53,330
Are we on?

920
01:41:53,410 --> 01:41:55,690
This calculator--

921
01:41:55,770 --> 01:41:57,770
Yeah, you're on.

922
01:41:57,850 --> 01:41:59,730
Yes, you're on. Go!

923
01:42:00,730 --> 01:42:02,610
We're live inside
Madison Square Garden...

924
01:42:02,690 --> 01:42:05,970
where Dr. Niko Tatopoulos
has discovered the beast's lair.

925
01:42:06,050 --> 01:42:08,570
Doctor, can you tell us
what's happening here?

926
01:42:10,850 --> 01:42:13,450
- That's you, yes. Go, go.
- Thank you.

927
01:42:13,530 --> 01:42:17,370
Well, we've discovered
over 200 eggs.

928
01:42:17,450 --> 01:42:18,970
Go get Hicks.

929
01:42:19,050 --> 01:42:22,090
Which a few moments ago began hatching.

930
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:27,890
The creatures just hatched are over nine
feet tall, and they've begun feeding.

931
01:42:30,970 --> 01:42:33,610
When their food supply runs out here...

932
01:42:33,690 --> 01:42:37,770
they will attempt to hunt down food
of their own outside of this nest.

933
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:40,570
Oh, my God!

934
01:42:40,650 --> 01:42:43,890
If they get out, they'll multiply
and soon a new species will emerge.

935
01:42:45,850 --> 01:42:48,650
One that could replace us as
the dominant species of this planet.

936
01:42:48,730 --> 01:42:51,850
Each one of these amazing reptiles...

937
01:42:51,930 --> 01:42:54,130
are born pregnant.

938
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:59,450
Adaptive and cunning, these 200
could become 40,000 within this year.

939
01:42:59,530 --> 01:43:02,290
If the military is listening
to this broadcast...

940
01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:04,650
they have to destroy this building
immediately...

941
01:43:04,730 --> 01:43:06,570
before these creatures
can escape.

942
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:14,730
So far they're all trapped
inside this building...

943
01:43:14,810 --> 01:43:18,570
but I don't think
we can contain them for long.

944
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:20,730
They're very strong, agile...

945
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:23,210
and they're looking for food.

946
01:43:23,290 --> 01:43:26,930
So your theory of the creature nesting
turned out to be correct after all.

947
01:43:29,610 --> 01:43:33,290
Regardless of what happens to us,
the most important thing...

948
01:43:33,370 --> 01:43:37,530
is that this building be destroyed
immediately before they escape.

949
01:43:37,610 --> 01:43:39,970
Reporting live
from Madison Square Garden...

950
01:43:40,050 --> 01:43:42,810
this is Audrey Timmonds
for WIDF News.

951
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:50,250
Thanks, Audrey.

952
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:52,490
Sure.

953
01:44:01,890 --> 01:44:04,250
That's affirmative.
Let me spell it out for you.

954
01:44:04,330 --> 01:44:07,210
I want you to blow up
Madison Square Garden.

955
01:44:14,970 --> 01:44:16,850
The good news is they got that message.

956
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:19,850
The bad news is we've got
less than six minutes to get out.

957
01:44:21,730 --> 01:44:23,930
Party's over.
Time to leave.

958
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:40,410
Anyone care to join me?

959
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:46,970
- Where did you find this guy?
- He's from France.

960
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:52,570
Stallion 1-5s I.P. inbound.

961
01:44:58,410 --> 01:44:59,770
You okay?

962
01:45:01,570 --> 01:45:03,690
Guys, this way. Come on.

963
01:45:04,730 --> 01:45:06,250
Oh, my God! The fish.

964
01:45:07,330 --> 01:45:08,850
Nick, come on!

965
01:45:08,930 --> 01:45:10,810
They've eaten all the fish.

966
01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:21,690
Come on, Nick! This way.

967
01:45:23,610 --> 01:45:25,930
Not this way! Back that way!

968
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:40,410
- The escalators.
- Hurry!

969
01:45:59,450 --> 01:46:01,210
Stallions, check master arms on.

970
01:46:01,290 --> 01:46:02,970
Two, three.

971
01:46:12,890 --> 01:46:14,490
I think I lost them.

972
01:46:33,770 --> 01:46:38,050
Stallion 1-5 showing a good laser track
on top of the Garden. Selecting L.G.B.

973
01:46:38,090 --> 01:46:41,410
How much time do we have left?

974
01:46:41,490 --> 01:46:43,930
Less than 30 seconds.

975
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:55,690
Let's go!

976
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:09,290
Let's go! Come on!

977
01:47:21,810 --> 01:47:23,170
Come on !

978
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:29,610
Save your Mavericks.

979
01:47:31,490 --> 01:47:32,370
Two away.

980
01:47:49,610 --> 01:47:51,930
Lead has good hits.

981
01:48:08,490 --> 01:48:10,370
Are you all right?

982
01:48:10,450 --> 01:48:11,810
Yeah.

983
01:48:12,930 --> 01:48:16,010
Somehow I never thought your life
was this exciting.

984
01:48:16,690 --> 01:48:18,650
You'd be surprised.

985
01:48:20,050 --> 01:48:21,890
I'd like to find out.

986
01:48:34,690 --> 01:48:36,890
How ya doin'?
You all right?

987
01:48:36,970 --> 01:48:38,850
I could use a coffee.

988
01:49:33,530 --> 01:49:35,250
He looks angry.

989
01:49:38,490 --> 01:49:40,490
What do we do?

990
01:49:40,570 --> 01:49:43,090
Running would be a good idea.

991
01:49:43,170 --> 01:49:44,530
Let's go!

992
01:50:07,690 --> 01:50:09,050
Come on !

993
01:50:20,930 --> 01:50:23,210
- Get in!
- What are you doin'?

994
01:50:58,810 --> 01:51:01,370
You better step on it, Mr. French.

995
01:51:10,490 --> 01:51:12,890
Take 57th Street
and cut up the Westside.

996
01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:14,810
Are you crazy?
Take the FDR.

997
01:51:15,970 --> 01:51:18,490
- The FDR in the rain?
- Got to be a map.

998
01:51:20,130 --> 01:51:22,370
He's gettin' larger!

999
01:51:31,530 --> 01:51:34,010
Take the Westside Highway!

1000
01:51:35,250 --> 01:51:38,010
- I got one.
- The Westside's got construction.

1001
01:51:38,050 --> 01:51:40,050
This is a subway map!

1002
01:51:41,810 --> 01:51:45,170
- Broadway?
- Make up your minds!

1003
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:55,810
Take Broadway!

1004
01:51:55,890 --> 01:51:58,850
We're traveling down Broadway.

1005
01:51:58,930 --> 01:52:01,330
Make a right on 34th Street.

1006
01:52:16,770 --> 01:52:18,090
That was O'Neal.

1007
01:52:18,170 --> 01:52:20,330
Is everybody okay?
Is everybody all right?

1008
01:52:20,410 --> 01:52:23,250
- Turn around. Do it!
- What? Why?

1009
01:52:36,530 --> 01:52:39,770
Command center, come in.
This is O'Neal for Hicks.

1010
01:53:00,610 --> 01:53:04,090
- What's going on?
- He's back, sir.

1011
01:53:04,130 --> 01:53:06,650
Godzilla is still alive.

1012
01:53:08,170 --> 01:53:10,930
Lieutenant Rodgers,
are those F-18s still in the air?

1013
01:53:11,010 --> 01:53:13,210
Yes, sir.
They're heading back to the base.

1014
01:53:13,250 --> 01:53:14,650
Turn 'em around.

1015
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:47,450
- Here it is.
- What are we looking for?

1016
01:53:47,490 --> 01:53:50,890
Every cab company keeps a record...

1017
01:53:50,970 --> 01:53:53,530
of each of its cab's
radio frequencies.

1018
01:53:57,570 --> 01:53:58,650
Bingo!

1019
01:54:04,490 --> 01:54:06,770
He's getting closer!

1020
01:54:09,050 --> 01:54:12,050
In there. Go in the tunnel.

1021
01:54:18,330 --> 01:54:20,810
They've got it blocked.

1022
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:31,930
- Now where would you like to go?
- Turn off the lights.

1023
01:54:39,330 --> 01:54:42,050
Nick, are you there?
Nick?

1024
01:54:43,970 --> 01:54:46,970
Nice trick with the cab I.D.
Where the hell are you?

1025
01:54:47,010 --> 01:54:49,650
You have to help us.
We're in the--

1026
01:54:49,730 --> 01:54:52,650
Park Avenue Tunnel.

1027
01:55:00,930 --> 01:55:03,170
He's got us trapped in here.

1028
01:55:03,250 --> 01:55:06,290
You guys have got to lure him
out into the open...

1029
01:55:06,330 --> 01:55:08,570
so we can get a clear shot at him.

1030
01:55:08,650 --> 01:55:11,050
No problem. You want us
to wash him up, too?

1031
01:55:15,330 --> 01:55:18,050
- Where's the nearest suspension bridge?
- Brooklyn.

1032
01:55:20,130 --> 01:55:23,290
- Let's go.
- How would you like us to do that?

1033
01:55:23,330 --> 01:55:25,890
This thing have high beams?

1034
01:55:33,410 --> 01:55:34,770
Now!

1035
01:55:43,930 --> 01:55:45,930
He's headed toward the Brooklyn Bridge.

1036
01:55:46,010 --> 01:55:48,690
Target is heading toward
the Brooklyn Bridge, sir.

1037
01:55:48,730 --> 01:55:50,690
Direct the F-18s
to the Brooklyn Bridge.

1038
01:55:57,530 --> 01:56:00,090
- He's not following us!
- Really?

1039
01:56:21,890 --> 01:56:24,210
You gotta be kiddin' me.
We're in his mouth.

1040
01:56:24,250 --> 01:56:26,650
We're in his mouth.

1041
01:56:30,730 --> 01:56:33,130
You're goin' the wrong way, man!

1042
01:56:33,210 --> 01:56:34,690
Will you shut up?

1043
01:56:52,050 --> 01:56:53,970
Gun it! Go, go!

1044
01:57:08,250 --> 01:57:09,330
Go, go!

1045
01:57:21,370 --> 01:57:22,410
Move it!

1046
01:57:44,690 --> 01:57:46,930
O'Neal, it worked!

1047
01:57:52,210 --> 01:57:54,370
He's caught in the suspension cables.
Do it!

1048
01:57:54,450 --> 01:57:55,970
- Now!
- Roger.

1049
01:57:59,130 --> 01:58:01,810
Stallion 1-5, tally one on the bridge.

1050
01:58:03,530 --> 01:58:04,890
Fire at will.

1051
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:08,770
Two away!

1052
01:58:19,250 --> 01:58:20,890
Hurry up, go!

1053
01:58:39,170 --> 01:58:41,970
Direct hit,
but the target is still moving.

1054
01:58:42,050 --> 01:58:44,010
Circle around and fire again!

1055
02:01:05,850 --> 02:01:07,690
That's my husband!

1056
02:01:07,730 --> 02:01:09,610
That's my husband!

1057
02:01:10,970 --> 02:01:13,410
I'm gonna kill him!

1058
02:01:19,370 --> 02:01:20,730
Oh, my.

1059
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:23,290
Oh, God. Oh, no!

1060
02:01:28,050 --> 02:01:30,410
Wait. Wait.

1061
02:01:30,490 --> 02:01:34,570
We can use this.
"The mayor who destroyed Godzilla."

1062
02:01:34,650 --> 02:01:36,890
I don't think we should exploit this.
It could backfire.

1063
02:01:36,930 --> 02:01:40,810
Listen, idiot. I do the thinking
around here. It's a magnificent idea.

1064
02:01:40,890 --> 02:01:43,370
You know what I think about you
and your campaign?

1065
02:01:45,090 --> 02:01:47,050
Where are you goin'? I need you.

1066
02:01:47,810 --> 02:01:49,570
O'Neal, do you read me?

1067
02:01:50,930 --> 02:01:52,930
Yes, sir.

1068
02:01:53,010 --> 02:01:55,330
That is one hell of a job, soldier.

1069
02:01:56,210 --> 02:01:58,530
That's one hell of a job.

1070
02:02:02,810 --> 02:02:04,690
Roger that, sir.

1071
02:02:06,610 --> 02:02:08,970
Sorry folks.
I've already promised my story...

1072
02:02:09,050 --> 02:02:13,050
as an exclusive to another reporter.

1073
02:02:13,130 --> 02:02:16,650
We did it!
We got the exclusive!

1074
02:02:16,730 --> 02:02:18,170
You're beautiful.

1075
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:20,650
We did?
I don't think so.

1076
02:02:20,730 --> 02:02:22,370
Remember you work for me.

1077
02:02:22,450 --> 02:02:25,690
Not anymore, Chuck.
I quit.

1078
02:02:30,210 --> 02:02:31,610
She quits.

1079
02:02:37,970 --> 02:02:40,450
All right, folks,
let's keep it movin'.

1080
02:02:43,610 --> 02:02:46,770
- You take the tape out of the camera?
- No.

1081
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:50,330
- I couldn't have just lost it.
- Where's Philippe?

1082
02:02:58,890 --> 02:03:00,090
Hello?

1083
02:03:00,170 --> 02:03:02,810
- Hello?
- It's Philippe.

1084
02:03:02,890 --> 02:03:04,450
Where are you?

1085
02:03:04,530 --> 02:03:08,730
Tell your friends I will send the tape
after I've removed a few items from it.

1086
02:03:08,770 --> 02:03:12,210
- I understand.
- I wanted to say au revoir.

1087
02:03:12,290 --> 02:03:15,450
Thank you for your help, my friend.

1088
02:03:17,650 --> 02:03:19,930
Wait. Hello?

1089
02:03:30,850 --> 02:03:33,530
Who was that French guy anyway?

1090
02:03:33,610 --> 02:03:36,010
Just some insurance guy.

1091
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:40,690
Did he say anything about my tape?

1092
02:03:40,770 --> 02:03:43,010
Yeah, he said something
about your tape.

1093
02:03:43,090 --> 02:03:46,810
- Does he have my tape or not?
- Yeah, he has your tape.
