1
00:01:45,998 --> 00:01:47,830
"I will praise the Lord,

2
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:51,930
"and so shall be saved
from mine enemies!"

3
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:56,273
"The waves of death
have closed about me!

4
00:01:57,843 --> 00:02:01,541
"The cords of hell
have encompassed me about,

5
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:05,817
"and the snares of death
have overtaken me. "

6
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,087
"... have encompassed me about,

7
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:14,958
"and the snares of death
have overtaken me!

8
00:02:15,294 --> 00:02:17,495
"In my tribulation,

9
00:02:17,496 --> 00:02:21,566
"I called to the Lord,
and cried to my God.

10
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:25,799
"And he heard my voice
cry at his temple. "

11
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:28,239
Get back.
Clear the way.

12
00:02:28,907 --> 00:02:30,773
Move back.

13
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,440
Keep in line, woman!

14
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,487
By order of Their Gracious
Majesties, Queen Mary and King Philip,

15
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:51,529
we are come to witness the burning
of these Protestant heretics,

16
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,767
who have denied the authority
of the one, true Catholic church

17
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:59,260
and of His Holiness, the Pope.

18
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:06,135
Let them burn for all eternity
in the flames of hell.

19
00:03:10,249 --> 00:03:11,716
"I called to the Lord,

20
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:14,580
"and cried to my God.
And he heard my voice... "

21
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,968
God bless you, Master Ridley!

22
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:32,270
For the love of God!

23
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:34,071
Friends! Help me!

24
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:36,063
I burn too slowly!

25
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:41,335
Help them!
For God's sake, help them!

26
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,649
"And so shall be saved
from mine enemies... "

27
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,491
Your Grace.

28
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:31,360
Your Grace.

29
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:34,429
Your Grace.

30
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,960
Grace.

31
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:39,664
Grace.

32
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,074
Your Grace,
the Queen is with child.

33
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,509
They should have consulted me
before they rang the bells.

34
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,522
Is it true?

35
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:00,082
There are symptoms.

36
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:02,493
She has ceased to bleed,
her breasts have some milk,

37
00:05:02,494 --> 00:05:03,761
and her stomach is swollen.

38
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,127
Is it true?

39
00:05:05,731 --> 00:05:09,266
The King has not shared
her bed for many months.

40
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,997
He has a repugnance for it,

41
00:05:11,403 --> 00:05:13,337
as lately Your Grace
has for mine.

42
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:32,046
Hmm.

43
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:37,051
Norfolk.

44
00:05:37,362 --> 00:05:40,064
Your Majesties,
this is most wondrous news.

45
00:05:40,065 --> 00:05:45,435
Indeed. We do thank God for
this, our most happy condition.

46
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,773
We must also thank His Majesty
for this blessed event,

47
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:51,243
which is nothing
short of a miracle.

48
00:05:56,081 --> 00:06:00,211
What news, my lords, of the
rebellion against our authority?

49
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,713
Sussex?

50
00:06:02,187 --> 00:06:04,555
Madam,
it is safely dispatched,

51
00:06:04,556 --> 00:06:05,756
thanks to His Grace.

52
00:06:05,757 --> 00:06:08,886
Sir Thomas Wyatt and the other
leaders are already dealt with.

53
00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:11,028
But if they had succeeded,

54
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:17,264
these Protestants and heretics meant
to place your sister upon the throne.

55
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,640
There is no proof
against the Lady Elizabeth.

56
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:24,041
She's plainly guilty.

57
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:25,342
What need is there of proof?

58
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,978
As long as she remains alive,

59
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,915
there will be plots
to raise her to the throne.

60
00:06:32,117 --> 00:06:33,744
Ambassador?

61
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,057
I agree with His Grace.
She is a heretic.

62
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,727
She must never be
allowed to succeed.

63
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:45,128
But if she...

64
00:06:46,798 --> 00:06:49,166
If she were
brought properly to trial,

65
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:51,335
she would not be found guilty,

66
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:53,532
and we would all be condemned.

67
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,206
She has many friends
in Parliament...

68
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,942
My sister was born
of that whore, Anne Boleyn!

69
00:06:57,943 --> 00:07:01,242
She was born a bastard.
She will never rule England.

70
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:13,116
Your Grace will find
some proof of her treachery.

71
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:15,022
I am most sure of it.

72
00:07:57,335 --> 00:07:58,860
It was so fast.

73
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:15,212
May I join you, my lady?

74
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:26,295
If it please you, sir.

75
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:46,001
My lady! My lady!

76
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,357
Princess Elizabeth!

77
00:10:13,538 --> 00:10:15,268
Princess Elizabeth!

78
00:10:22,514 --> 00:10:26,050
You are accused of conspiring
with Sir Thomas Wyatt and others

79
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:30,317
against Her Sovereign Majesty
and are arrested for treason.

80
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:37,725
I am commanded to take you hence
from this place to the Tower.

81
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,872
Remember who you are.

82
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:03,181
Do not be afraid of them.

83
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:08,754
My lady.

84
00:11:49,901 --> 00:11:51,995
Prisoner to the steps.

85
00:11:58,877 --> 00:12:02,513
I cannot confess to something
I did not do!

86
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,848
Your denials are all in vain!

87
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:08,152
You knew of the rebellion,
madam. You were party to it!

88
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:10,154
It is plain enough.

89
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:11,255
Where is your proof?

90
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:13,090
It was to your advantage.

91
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:14,925
You must let me
see the Queen. I must...

92
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:18,760
You despise the Queen
and the Catholic faith!

93
00:12:26,337 --> 00:12:30,775
I am a true
and faithful subject.

94
00:12:31,443 --> 00:12:32,743
I attend Mass...

95
00:12:32,744 --> 00:12:35,042
You pretend,
but in your heart...

96
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:40,874
What's that?
What say you, madam?

97
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:42,949
Speak up!

98
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:47,958
Madam, if there is some
small truth in these charges,

99
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:52,429
however innocently or
unknowingly you did proceed,

100
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,228
you had best confess.

101
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:57,734
I ask you why we must
tear ourselves apart

102
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,904
for this small question
of religion,

103
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,372
- Catholic and Protestant...
- Small?

104
00:13:02,373 --> 00:13:04,908
You think it small,

105
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,707
though it killed your mother?

106
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:18,717
We all...

107
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:23,260
We all believe in God,
my lords.

108
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:28,665
No, madam. There is only
one true belief. The other,

109
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,861
heresy.

110
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:00,497
Madam, you are cold.

111
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:02,398
I do not need your pity.

112
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:05,229
Accept it, then.

113
00:14:05,904 --> 00:14:07,303
For my sake.

114
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:11,839
Thank you.

115
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:16,044
I shall not forget
this kindness.

116
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,146
Tonight I think I die.

117
00:15:37,428 --> 00:15:38,794
Madam.

118
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,600
No!

119
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:44,968
Where do you take her?

120
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:47,495
Please! What's going on?

121
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,413
Save me! Save me!

122
00:15:59,183 --> 00:16:00,708
Save me!

123
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:02,415
You...

124
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,153
Oh, no!

125
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,147
I am Your Majesty's
most humble servant.

126
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:54,168
Come here.

127
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,138
Closer,
so I might see your face.

128
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:10,354
When I look at you,
I see nothing of the King,

129
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:12,923
only that whore, your mother.

130
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:13,914
Hmm.

131
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,691
My father never did anything
so well as to cut off her head.

132
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:23,000
Your Majesty forgets
he was also my father.

133
00:17:26,971 --> 00:17:30,066
Why will you not confess
your crimes against me?

134
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:33,937
Because, Your Majesty,
I have committed none.

135
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,774
You speak with such sincerity.

136
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,247
I see you're still
a consummate actress.

137
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,253
My husband is gone.

138
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:50,655
They have poisoned my child.

139
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:54,030
They say it is a tumor.

140
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:58,201
Madam, you are not well.

141
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,729
They say this cancer will make
you Queen, but they are wrong!

142
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:03,940
Look there!
It is your death warrant.

143
00:18:03,941 --> 00:18:05,876
All I need do is sign it.

144
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:07,939
Mary.

145
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:12,580
If you sign that paper, you will
be murdering your own sister.

146
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,657
You will promise me something?

147
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:24,995
When I am gone,

148
00:18:24,996 --> 00:18:30,267
you will do everything in your
power to uphold the Catholic faith.

149
00:18:30,268 --> 00:18:34,104
Do not take away from the people the
consolations of the Blessed Virgin,

150
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:36,597
their Holy Mother.

151
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,071
When I am Queen,

152
00:18:42,847 --> 00:18:44,246
I promise

153
00:18:46,617 --> 00:18:50,713
to act
as my conscience dictates.

154
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:56,293
Well, do not think
to be Queen at all!

155
00:18:56,294 --> 00:18:58,395
You may return
to your own house at Hatfield,

156
00:18:58,396 --> 00:19:01,331
but you will remain there under
arrest until I am recovered.

157
00:19:03,134 --> 00:19:05,034
Thank you, Your Majesty.

158
00:19:05,536 --> 00:19:06,560
No.

159
00:19:07,004 --> 00:19:08,904
Feed her to the wolves.

160
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,302
Let her see
what they are like.

161
00:19:59,123 --> 00:20:03,026
She's just a child. And yet
still you piss yourselves!

162
00:20:05,897 --> 00:20:08,832
Your Grace, Protestants are
already returning from abroad.

163
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:14,564
Yes, and have made plans to
massacre every Catholic in England.

164
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,075
There would be butchery, indeed, if
such a plan were even conceivable.

165
00:20:19,076 --> 00:20:22,103
They say Walsingham
will return from France.

166
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:23,873
Walsingham is nothing!

167
00:20:31,322 --> 00:20:33,450
Be sure he does not.

168
00:20:34,325 --> 00:20:38,523
There's so little beauty in this
world. And so much suffering.

169
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,266
Do you suppose
that is what God had in mind?

170
00:20:44,635 --> 00:20:47,366
That is to say,
if there is a God at all.

171
00:20:49,473 --> 00:20:53,069
Perhaps there is nothing
in this universe but ourselves

172
00:20:53,978 --> 00:20:55,946
and our thoughts.

173
00:21:03,754 --> 00:21:05,723
Think before you do this.

174
00:21:15,132 --> 00:21:16,896
If you must do it,

175
00:21:18,102 --> 00:21:19,729
then do it now.

176
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,301
And without regret.

177
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:25,701
But first think carefully.

178
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:30,907
And be certain

179
00:21:31,215 --> 00:21:33,183
why it needs to be done.

180
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,466
Look out there.

181
00:21:57,008 --> 00:21:59,602
There is a whole world
waiting for you.

182
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,441
Innocence is the most
precious thing you possess.

183
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,684
Lose that
and you lose your soul.

184
00:22:26,671 --> 00:22:28,171
Amen.

185
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:30,402
Father... Sir William!

186
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:32,308
My lady.

187
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,645
There was nowhere else
we could meet in safety.

188
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,546
Listen to me carefully.

189
00:22:37,882 --> 00:22:40,009
All things move in our favor.

190
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:44,480
Many of our friends are, even
now, returning from exile, but...

191
00:22:44,755 --> 00:22:47,247
These are most uncertain times

192
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,722
and your life
remains in danger.

193
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:53,229
You must therefore say nothing

194
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,223
and meet no one whose
visit may compromise you.

195
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:58,001
No one?

196
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,937
No one. Not even Lord Robert.

197
00:23:00,938 --> 00:23:02,272
But he is a trusted friend!

198
00:23:02,273 --> 00:23:04,139
Child. Listen to me.

199
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:06,103
Please.

200
00:23:07,378 --> 00:23:10,245
You are most innocent
in the ways of this world,

201
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:16,386
and we must do all we may to
guarantee the security of your throne.

202
00:23:16,387 --> 00:23:18,922
But there is someone
I do wish you to meet.

203
00:23:18,923 --> 00:23:22,058
Monsignor Alvaro de la Quadra,
the Spanish ambassador.

204
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:23,959
Sir William, why would...

205
00:23:28,632 --> 00:23:32,228
My lady, I bring a message.

206
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,168
The King of Spain
is enraptured,

207
00:23:35,773 --> 00:23:37,764
and offers you
his hand in marriage.

208
00:23:37,908 --> 00:23:39,899
My sister is not yet dead.

209
00:23:40,578 --> 00:23:42,375
Her bed is still warm.

210
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,782
His Majesty finds it
already cold.

211
00:23:59,997 --> 00:24:03,991
You must sign it.
For the love of God, sign it.

212
00:24:07,972 --> 00:24:10,702
Will you leave
your kingdom to a heretic?

213
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,482
He then said

214
00:24:19,483 --> 00:24:21,818
that this King would marry me,

215
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:26,623
but would not expect to share my bed
more than two or three times a year.

216
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,182
As much as that?

217
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,657
Well, if he...

218
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:34,898
He is enraptured...

219
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:36,230
Naturally.

220
00:24:38,402 --> 00:24:42,305
But his affairs would
otherwise keep him in Spain.

221
00:24:44,141 --> 00:24:46,007
Then the King is a fool.

222
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:54,974
For what affairs could ever be important
enough to keep him from your bed?

223
00:25:04,762 --> 00:25:08,630
Robert, you should not say
such things.

224
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:11,461
Then I shall only think them.

225
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:18,408
Oh, everything's
still so uncertain.

226
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:21,077
Sir William says that
my life is still in danger.

227
00:25:21,078 --> 00:25:23,103
Do not listen to everything
Sir William tells you.

228
00:25:23,247 --> 00:25:26,546
Do not listen to any of them.
None of them are of consequence.

229
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,017
When you are Queen...

230
00:25:28,018 --> 00:25:30,419
I am not...
I am not Queen yet.

231
00:25:30,554 --> 00:25:31,954
You will be.

232
00:25:33,123 --> 00:25:36,355
Elizabeth, Queen of England.

233
00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:41,527
A court to worship you,
a country to obey you,

234
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:45,468
poems written
celebrating your beauty,

235
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:50,669
music composed in your honor,
and they will be nothing to you.

236
00:25:51,475 --> 00:25:52,966
I will mean nothing to you.

237
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:01,109
Oh, how could you ever
be nothing to me?

238
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:07,220
Robert, you know
you are everything to me.

239
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,451
All that I am,

240
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,991
it is you.

241
00:26:37,021 --> 00:26:38,420
Is she dead?

242
00:26:58,108 --> 00:26:59,633
Give it to her.

243
00:27:27,071 --> 00:27:28,402
My lady.

244
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,301
The Earl of Sussex is here.

245
00:28:25,896 --> 00:28:27,887
The Queen is dead.

246
00:28:28,532 --> 00:28:30,296
Long live the Queen!

247
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,339
Long live the Queen!

248
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:45,909
"This is the Lord's doing,

249
00:28:47,384 --> 00:28:49,682
"and it is marvelous
in our eyes. "

250
00:28:56,293 --> 00:29:02,392
To the north, I present unto you
Elizabeth, your undoubted Queen.

251
00:29:04,935 --> 00:29:11,534
To the south, I present to you
Elizabeth, your undoubted Queen.

252
00:30:26,717 --> 00:30:29,686
I crown thee Elizabeth,

253
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,726
Queen of England,
Ireland and France.

254
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:11,019
God save Your Majesty.

255
00:31:15,732 --> 00:31:16,866
Your Majesty should know

256
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:21,437
that you have inherited a most
powerless and degenerate state.

257
00:31:21,438 --> 00:31:24,607
It's threatened from abroad by
the ambitions of France and Spain

258
00:31:24,608 --> 00:31:29,178
and is weaker in strength,
in men, moneys, and riches

259
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,713
than I have ever known it.

260
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:31,781
What are you saying?

261
00:31:31,782 --> 00:31:33,849
Madam, your treasury is empty.

262
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,653
The navy is run down,
there is no standing army,

263
00:31:37,654 --> 00:31:39,956
and we are bare of munitions.

264
00:31:39,957 --> 00:31:44,160
There isn't a fortress left in England
that could withstand a single shot.

265
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:45,924
I have no desire
to go to war, sir.

266
00:31:46,063 --> 00:31:48,197
But that is not the end of it.

267
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:51,896
Apart from abroad, here at home there
are those who wish Your Majesty ill.

268
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:56,172
Mary of Scots has already
laid claim to your throne.

269
00:31:56,173 --> 00:32:00,041
And Norfolk. Norfolk
covets it relentlessly.

270
00:32:01,411 --> 00:32:03,279
Madam.

271
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:09,219
Until you marry and produce an
heir, you will find no security.

272
00:32:24,134 --> 00:32:26,398
Sir Christopher Hatton.

273
00:32:38,682 --> 00:32:40,583
There is...
Oh, I do not see...

274
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:43,019
Lord Ainsley, Your Majesty.

275
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,454
I do not see why
a woman need marry at all.

276
00:32:59,736 --> 00:33:01,705
Come on, come on!

277
00:33:03,006 --> 00:33:04,507
This is Mistress Quickly.

278
00:33:04,508 --> 00:33:05,771
Majesty.
Majesty.

279
00:33:11,415 --> 00:33:13,076
Your Majesty.

280
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,418
Your Majesty.

281
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:24,617
You will recall His Excellency,
the Spanish ambassador, ma'am.

282
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,496
How could I forget?

283
00:33:27,497 --> 00:33:29,523
Excellency.
Your Majesty.

284
00:33:35,172 --> 00:33:36,799
He's French.
You'll have to speak up.

285
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,610
Do I know that gentleman?

286
00:33:48,352 --> 00:33:51,387
That is
Sir Francis Walsingham, madam.

287
00:33:51,388 --> 00:33:53,122
He is returned from exile now

288
00:33:53,123 --> 00:33:57,390
and I have appointed him to have
a care for Your Majesty's person.

289
00:34:07,137 --> 00:34:08,502
Excellency.

290
00:34:10,073 --> 00:34:11,404
Majesty.

291
00:34:11,575 --> 00:34:12,701
Hey!

292
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,373
Majesty.

293
00:34:18,615 --> 00:34:22,318
May I present the French ambassador,
His Excellency, Monsieur de Foix.

294
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:23,912
Your Excellency.

295
00:34:25,255 --> 00:34:28,282
I suppose the French do offer
some suitor to her.

296
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,491
Naturally.

297
00:34:32,162 --> 00:34:35,223
Everything now depends upon
the husband that woman takes.

298
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:38,501
King Henry of Anjou sends you
his brotherly love.

299
00:34:38,502 --> 00:34:41,003
He trusts that
with your accession,

300
00:34:41,004 --> 00:34:44,173
the relationship between our
countries may be much improved.

301
00:34:44,174 --> 00:34:45,841
That is also my hope.

302
00:34:45,842 --> 00:34:48,811
With such consideration,
the King expects

303
00:34:48,812 --> 00:34:52,407
that you will consider the suit
of his brother, the Duke of Anjou.

304
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:56,816
Well, naturally, Her Majesty will
consider the proposal most carefully.

305
00:35:00,657 --> 00:35:04,855
It is unfortunate, however, that at
this time the Duke's aunt, Mary of Guise,

306
00:35:05,328 --> 00:35:08,958
chooses to garrison Scotland
with French troops.

307
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,667
Ladies?

308
00:35:20,143 --> 00:35:22,011
The marriage of a Queen,
Excellency,

309
00:35:22,012 --> 00:35:24,674
is born of politics,
not of childish passion.

310
00:35:33,457 --> 00:35:34,623
Your Grace.

311
00:35:34,624 --> 00:35:36,115
Walsingham.

312
00:35:40,497 --> 00:35:41,664
Welcome to England.

313
00:35:41,665 --> 00:35:43,532
Your Grace is surprised?

314
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:45,968
No,
only a little disappointed.

315
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,682
Play a volta!

316
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,439
When may I see you in private?

317
00:37:31,408 --> 00:37:33,399
In private?

318
00:37:34,978 --> 00:37:37,613
Have you forgot, my lord?

319
00:37:37,614 --> 00:37:39,446
I am Queen now.

320
00:37:59,302 --> 00:38:00,394
He's coming.

321
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,967
He's coming.

322
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:17,686
My ladies.

323
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:19,712
My Lord.
My Lord.

324
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:24,452
You blush, Lady Knollys.

325
00:38:25,729 --> 00:38:27,596
Are you in love?

326
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:28,860
No, my lord.

327
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:31,492
Then you should be,
or waste all that beauty.

328
00:38:41,344 --> 00:38:43,836
Does Her Majesty sleep?

329
00:38:44,714 --> 00:38:46,515
Not yet, Sir William.

330
00:38:46,516 --> 00:38:48,250
She is overwrought.

331
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:49,446
Hmm.

332
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,287
I wish you to show me Her
Majesty's sheets every morning.

333
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,154
I must know
all her proper functions.

334
00:38:54,491 --> 00:38:57,688
Proper functions, Sir William?

335
00:38:58,628 --> 00:38:59,823
Indeed.

336
00:39:01,865 --> 00:39:06,461
Her Majesty's body and person
are no longer her own property.

337
00:39:07,337 --> 00:39:09,533
They belong to the State.

338
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,302
Yes, sir.

339
00:41:00,783 --> 00:41:02,149
Your Grace.

340
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:05,354
Your Grace,
Her Majesty is not risen.

341
00:41:05,355 --> 00:41:07,016
Your Grace.

342
00:41:08,858 --> 00:41:10,492
Please, Your Grace.

343
00:41:10,493 --> 00:41:12,494
Her Majesty is not yet ready
to receive visitors.

344
00:41:12,495 --> 00:41:13,656
Madam.

345
00:41:16,566 --> 00:41:18,167
You had best get up.

346
00:41:18,168 --> 00:41:20,159
There is some grave news.

347
00:41:25,575 --> 00:41:27,643
My Lady, I'm sorry.

348
00:41:27,644 --> 00:41:30,279
Mary of Guise has increased
the French garrison in Scotland

349
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,770
by 4,000 men.

350
00:41:32,148 --> 00:41:33,878
Perhaps more.

351
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:38,754
Madam, I'm afraid
the French mean to attack

352
00:41:38,755 --> 00:41:45,183
while we are still weak and while Your
Majesty's reign is still uncertain.

353
00:41:48,565 --> 00:41:49,731
What is your counsel?

354
00:41:49,732 --> 00:41:53,897
Madam, we must, with all haste,
raise an army to march upon Scotland.

355
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,773
Can... Can...

356
00:42:06,683 --> 00:42:09,482
Can we not send emissaries?
There is no time for that!

357
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:11,486
As Queen,
we look to you for action,

358
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:15,891
unless you are content to wait for
the French to send more reinforcements.

359
00:42:18,061 --> 00:42:19,153
Here.

360
00:42:35,278 --> 00:42:36,778
Are you all in agreement?

361
00:42:36,779 --> 00:42:41,114
I say there's never been a better time
or occasion to abate the French pride.

362
00:42:42,118 --> 00:42:43,347
Arundel?

363
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:48,488
War is a sin,
but sometimes a necessary one.

364
00:42:51,628 --> 00:42:52,828
I...

365
00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:54,388
Lord Robert, you were
appointed to the council

366
00:42:54,731 --> 00:42:56,699
to protect the interests
of England.

367
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,597
Now it appears you do not have
the stomach for it.

368
00:42:59,936 --> 00:43:01,734
I'm in agreement, Your Grace.

369
00:43:03,172 --> 00:43:06,506
If Your Majesty's throne
is at risk.

370
00:43:15,251 --> 00:43:16,752
What say you, Walsingham?

371
00:43:16,753 --> 00:43:18,253
Your Majesty!

372
00:43:18,254 --> 00:43:21,924
I say a prince should rather
be slow to take action

373
00:43:21,925 --> 00:43:25,894
and should watch that he does not
come to be afraid of his own shadow.

374
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,364
Now, madam...
With your permission, madam.

375
00:43:28,665 --> 00:43:31,800
You are not, Sir Francis,
a member of council,

376
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:33,895
nor are you in the majority.

377
00:43:35,471 --> 00:43:37,201
I do not like wars.

378
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,036
They have uncertain outcomes.

379
00:46:40,356 --> 00:46:44,190
Go back to England,
and take this to your Queen.

380
00:46:46,195 --> 00:46:47,185
Hmm?

381
00:47:16,425 --> 00:47:18,159
Where are my counselors?

382
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,895
I know not, madam.

383
00:47:19,896 --> 00:47:21,263
Where is Lord Robert?

384
00:47:21,264 --> 00:47:23,994
Lord Robert, madam,
has gone hunting.

385
00:47:29,572 --> 00:47:33,201
Leave me. Go! Go!

386
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:41,710
I regret to inform Your Majesty of
our miserable defeat in Scotland.

387
00:47:42,351 --> 00:47:46,447
The bishops do demand
Your Majesty's removal.

388
00:47:46,923 --> 00:47:49,619
Defiance afoot
in every quarter.

389
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:53,695
Alas, madam, we are
come already to catastrophe.

390
00:48:27,997 --> 00:48:30,432
How dare you
come into my presence?

391
00:48:34,103 --> 00:48:36,104
Why do you follow me here?

392
00:48:36,105 --> 00:48:39,097
It is my business
to protect Your Majesty.

393
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:42,410
Against all things.

394
00:48:42,411 --> 00:48:46,405
I do not need protection.
I need to be left alone.

395
00:48:46,916 --> 00:48:48,145
Majesty.

396
00:48:50,186 --> 00:48:53,121
They should never have been
sent to Scotland.

397
00:48:56,158 --> 00:48:59,060
My father would not have made
such a mistake.

398
00:49:01,297 --> 00:49:03,629
I have been proved
unfit to rule.

399
00:49:05,868 --> 00:49:10,038
Well, that is what you all
think, is it not, Walsingham?

400
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:12,201
It is not for me to judge you.

401
00:49:15,011 --> 00:49:16,845
Why did they send
such children?

402
00:49:16,846 --> 00:49:19,648
Why did they not send
proper reinforcements?

403
00:49:19,649 --> 00:49:21,879
Because the bishops
would not let them.

404
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:24,844
They spoke against it
in the pulpits.

405
00:49:25,855 --> 00:49:29,290
Then they are speaking
against their Queen.

406
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:32,887
Madam, the bishops are against
you and have no fear of you.

407
00:49:33,729 --> 00:49:36,130
They do not expect you
to survive.

408
00:49:49,979 --> 00:49:52,311
My lord, the Queen.

409
00:50:15,371 --> 00:50:17,134
Where have you been?

410
00:50:21,277 --> 00:50:23,143
You were not at court.

411
00:50:26,382 --> 00:50:29,215
Majesty. Monsieur de Foix.

412
00:50:29,351 --> 00:50:33,822
Mary of Guise, ma'am, promises to make
no further threat against Your Majesty,

413
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:36,986
but on one condition.

414
00:50:37,626 --> 00:50:39,618
What condition?

415
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:46,594
That Your Majesty considers the proposal
of her nephew, the Duke of Anjou.

416
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:58,042
The Duke is most eager
to meet Your Majesty.

417
00:50:58,381 --> 00:51:01,111
He has heard a great deal
of your beauty.

418
00:51:02,718 --> 00:51:04,652
For the love of God, ma'am,

419
00:51:04,653 --> 00:51:10,492
let not the care of your diseased
estate hang in the balance any longer.

420
00:51:10,493 --> 00:51:15,230
In marriage and
in the production of an heir

421
00:51:15,231 --> 00:51:17,324
lies your only surety.

422
00:51:17,767 --> 00:51:21,601
The Duke is also
most handsome.

423
00:51:32,281 --> 00:51:33,612
Very well.

424
00:51:36,752 --> 00:51:38,482
Invite the Duke of Anjou.

425
00:51:39,188 --> 00:51:41,384
We shall see him in the flesh.

426
00:51:52,768 --> 00:51:54,602
Robert!
Go away!

427
00:51:54,603 --> 00:51:59,441
The Duke will not take kindly
to a rival for his suit.

428
00:51:59,442 --> 00:52:04,072
He is a traitor
and his father before him.

429
00:52:04,313 --> 00:52:07,806
Lord Robert's head
will end up on a spike,

430
00:52:08,217 --> 00:52:10,345
not on the pillow of a Queen.

431
00:52:12,454 --> 00:52:15,390
Do you think you understand
what you just did? Do you?

432
00:52:23,699 --> 00:52:25,258
Must you leave?

433
00:52:26,535 --> 00:52:29,232
I would not miss this
for the world.

434
00:52:29,638 --> 00:52:33,097
Today I shall watch
the fall of that heretic girl.

435
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:40,913
I have been placed here
as your sovereign...

436
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,154
I am your sovereign.
I have been placed here...

437
00:52:53,529 --> 00:52:54,519
I...

438
00:52:55,564 --> 00:52:58,666
God has...
God has placed me here.

439
00:52:58,667 --> 00:53:01,603
I am your anointed sovereign.

440
00:53:01,604 --> 00:53:05,700
I am your Queen and, like
my father, I mean to rule.

441
00:53:05,841 --> 00:53:08,643
There is one thing higher
than royalty, my lords,

442
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:11,841
and that is religion.

443
00:53:14,617 --> 00:53:16,483
I pass this Act of...

444
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,719
I ask you to...

445
00:53:18,954 --> 00:53:21,287
I ask you to pass
this Act of Uniformity.

446
00:53:22,391 --> 00:53:23,483
It's not for myself.
It's for my people.

447
00:53:26,362 --> 00:53:28,262
They're my people.

448
00:53:28,898 --> 00:53:30,732
My lords, there is one God.
We have a common...

449
00:53:30,733 --> 00:53:32,098
There is one God.

450
00:53:33,769 --> 00:53:37,038
This is for my people.
My people are my care...

451
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:38,336
Only care.

452
00:53:39,441 --> 00:53:42,809
The truth be, my lords, your votes
are nothing without my consent.

453
00:53:56,959 --> 00:54:02,762
If there is no uniformity
of religious belief here,

454
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,665
then there can only be
fragmentation,

455
00:54:09,605 --> 00:54:12,006
Dispute, and quarrel.

456
00:54:13,776 --> 00:54:20,307
Surely, my lords, it is better to
have a single Church of England.

457
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:32,560
A single Church of England

458
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:34,120
with a common prayer book...

459
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:36,896
And a...

460
00:54:39,602 --> 00:54:42,594
And a common purpose.

461
00:54:47,476 --> 00:54:50,878
Now, I ask you to pass
this Act of Uniformity not...

462
00:54:52,381 --> 00:54:54,406
Not for myself,

463
00:54:55,284 --> 00:54:57,776
but for my people,

464
00:55:00,522 --> 00:55:02,718
who are my only care.

465
00:55:03,625 --> 00:55:05,960
Madam, by this act...

466
00:55:05,961 --> 00:55:10,728
By this act, you force us to relinquish
our allegiance to the Holy Father.

467
00:55:15,804 --> 00:55:18,603
How can I force you,
Your Grace?

468
00:55:19,074 --> 00:55:20,804
I am a woman.

469
00:55:23,879 --> 00:55:27,941
I have no desire to make
windows into men's souls.

470
00:55:30,085 --> 00:55:31,610
I simply ask,

471
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:40,261
can any man, in truth, serve two
masters and be faithful to both?

472
00:55:40,262 --> 00:55:43,231
Madam, this... This is heresy!

473
00:55:43,232 --> 00:55:44,732
Heresy indeed!
Heresy indeed!

474
00:55:44,733 --> 00:55:48,431
No, Your Grace.
This is common sense,

475
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:51,732
which is a most
English virtue.

476
00:55:55,644 --> 00:55:57,772
Where is Gardiner?
Where are the others?

477
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,814
Let us out!

478
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,544
Open the door!

479
00:56:04,687 --> 00:56:06,985
This is Walsingham's doing.

480
00:56:08,057 --> 00:56:09,684
It is the devil's work.

481
00:56:09,858 --> 00:56:12,327
It will not serve her
in any case.

482
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:17,728
The bishops will pass no measure
which severs us from Rome.

483
00:56:20,602 --> 00:56:24,630
Your Majesty would
improve all these matters

484
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,308
if you would agree to marry.

485
00:56:27,309 --> 00:56:29,437
Aye. Marry, then.

486
00:56:30,045 --> 00:56:31,035
Aye.

487
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,173
But marry who, Your Grace?

488
00:56:35,317 --> 00:56:37,650
Will you give me
some suggestion?

489
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:43,558
For some say France,
and others Spain,

490
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:46,460
and some cannot
abide foreigners at all.

491
00:56:47,429 --> 00:56:51,832
So I'm not sure how best to please
you unless I married one of each.

492
00:56:58,307 --> 00:57:01,576
Now Your Majesty does make fun
of the sanctity of marriage.

493
00:57:01,577 --> 00:57:06,071
I do not think you should
lecture me on that, my lord,

494
00:57:06,315 --> 00:57:09,774
since you yourself
have been twice divorced

495
00:57:10,753 --> 00:57:13,313
and are now upon
your third wife.

496
00:57:19,995 --> 00:57:23,795
Each of you must vote
according to your conscience.

497
00:57:26,001 --> 00:57:29,237
But remember this.

498
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:35,109
In your hands,
upon this moment,

499
00:57:35,511 --> 00:57:39,607
lies the future happiness
of my people

500
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:44,345
and the peace of this realm.

501
00:57:45,988 --> 00:57:49,390
Let that be upon
your conscience also.

502
00:57:56,899 --> 00:57:59,197
My lords,
the house will divide.

503
00:58:09,178 --> 00:58:11,145
Walsingham.

504
00:58:11,146 --> 00:58:15,413
I would know on what authority
you have kept us locked up here.

505
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:19,787
Your Graces must forgive me,
but you're now free to go.

506
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:24,487
I am sure this infernal work
has not saved your bastard Queen.

507
00:58:26,094 --> 00:58:29,292
Her Majesty has won
the argument.

508
00:58:29,565 --> 00:58:31,032
By what count?

509
00:58:32,534 --> 00:58:34,298
By five, Your Grace.

510
00:58:37,272 --> 00:58:38,365
Five.

511
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,611
You will be damned for this

512
00:58:43,345 --> 00:58:47,009
and I pray God your wretched
soul will burn in hell!

513
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:22,669
No...

514
01:00:23,111 --> 01:00:26,240
Because I am Anjou!

515
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:32,978
Yes, I am Anjou, yes.
I am Anjou.

516
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,115
Yes.

517
01:00:46,501 --> 01:00:48,561
And I can't wait.

518
01:00:59,448 --> 01:01:01,177
Would you like that?

519
01:01:02,384 --> 01:01:04,409
Remove your hand.

520
01:01:04,686 --> 01:01:06,654
Perhaps, Your Grace.
We shall think on it.

521
01:01:06,655 --> 01:01:09,490
But I am deeply religious.

522
01:01:09,491 --> 01:01:11,289
But I am very religious,
too, huh?

523
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:14,295
Very religious, yes.

524
01:01:30,779 --> 01:01:33,874
Your Holiness, the priest
from England is here.

525
01:01:54,202 --> 01:01:55,795
Tell me, my son,

526
01:01:56,405 --> 01:02:00,307
what is the news of our
brothers and sisters in England?

527
01:02:00,776 --> 01:02:05,312
Do they still support the sovereignty
of that illegitimate whore?

528
01:02:05,313 --> 01:02:06,542
No, Holy Father.

529
01:02:07,516 --> 01:02:11,009
They pray ceaselessly that England
may be recovered from heresy.

530
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:14,086
Prayers may not be sufficient.

531
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:20,087
I will ask for guidance in
this matter, but do not despair.

532
01:02:20,529 --> 01:02:24,989
Was it not truly said that the
righteous shall inherit the earth?

533
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:20,946
"My true love has my heart,
and I have hers

534
01:03:22,491 --> 01:03:25,949
"My heart in me
keeps her and me in one

535
01:03:27,128 --> 01:03:32,066
"My heart in her
her thoughts and senses guide

536
01:03:32,234 --> 01:03:33,861
"She loves my heart

537
01:03:34,836 --> 01:03:37,601
"for once it was her own

538
01:03:38,673 --> 01:03:45,079
"I cherish hers
because in me it bides

539
01:03:48,149 --> 01:03:53,315
"My true love has my heart,
and I have hers. "

540
01:03:53,688 --> 01:03:55,520
Marry me.

541
01:04:12,741 --> 01:04:14,231
Marry me.

542
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:59,680
On a night such as this,
could any woman say no?

543
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:06,491
On a night such as this,
could a Queen say no?

544
01:05:07,596 --> 01:05:11,899
Does not a Queen sit under the
same stars as any other woman?

545
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:20,174
Monsignor Alvaro!
Monsignor Alvaro!

546
01:05:20,175 --> 01:05:22,042
Monsignor Alvaro, tell me.

547
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:25,809
As well as ambassador,
are you not also a bishop?

548
01:05:27,849 --> 01:05:30,117
I am, my lord.

549
01:05:30,118 --> 01:05:31,586
Then you can marry us!

550
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,356
Marry you?

551
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:40,928
Or perhaps he does not know enough
English to perform the ceremony.

552
01:05:40,929 --> 01:05:45,127
Alas, madam, in this matter,
I can be of no help to you.

553
01:05:50,772 --> 01:05:52,439
Madam!

554
01:05:54,809 --> 01:05:56,076
Protect her!
Protect the Queen!

555
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:57,170
Help her! Help her!

556
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,980
Quickly, form a guard!

557
01:05:59,981 --> 01:06:01,382
Hurry, man!

558
01:06:02,984 --> 01:06:06,011
The Queen! The Queen!

559
01:06:06,187 --> 01:06:08,588
Look to the Queen!

560
01:06:14,362 --> 01:06:16,063
Make way.

561
01:06:16,064 --> 01:06:18,362
It's Her Majesty. Make way.

562
01:06:20,735 --> 01:06:24,331
Isabel, see that the ladies
are prepared. Isabel, go!

563
01:06:24,472 --> 01:06:25,997
Where were you,
Sir Francis?

564
01:06:27,409 --> 01:06:31,368
I only hope that Her Majesty may be
safely delivered from this present danger.

565
01:06:36,518 --> 01:06:39,009
Get the bedchamber ready,
ladies, quickly! We come.

566
01:06:40,388 --> 01:06:45,622
I am perfectly well.
Please do not... Do not fuss.

567
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:52,661
No one is to enter.
Yes, Sir William.

568
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:57,764
Stay near now, and keep watch.
Yes, Sir Francis.

569
01:07:08,116 --> 01:07:10,141
Sorry, Lord Robert.

570
01:07:12,954 --> 01:07:14,615
I said no one.

571
01:07:26,901 --> 01:07:28,426
My lord.

572
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:30,065
A word.

573
01:07:49,324 --> 01:07:51,588
To whose advantage was this?

574
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:53,756
De Foix?

575
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:58,861
No. Not with Anjou in play.

576
01:08:00,502 --> 01:08:03,096
Then some madman.

577
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:05,706
There is always madness,
Master Elyot.

578
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:10,008
This was devised.
There is reason behind it.

579
01:08:10,311 --> 01:08:13,543
Then Alvaro,
for he has most cause.

580
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:16,116
Yes, yes, yes.
But he was present.

581
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:18,686
He's too subtle for that.

582
01:08:20,021 --> 01:08:25,721
But Norfolk. He's not so
subtle, and has even more cause.

583
01:08:27,028 --> 01:08:28,223
Indeed.

584
01:08:28,596 --> 01:08:33,159
So then he's not in league
with the Spanish.

585
01:08:33,401 --> 01:08:35,426
Perhaps. Stay close to him.

586
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:37,998
The Duke has some other game.

587
01:08:38,606 --> 01:08:40,597
I must find where he plays.

588
01:08:42,277 --> 01:08:46,304
I see it is true that the Queen
favors you above all others.

589
01:08:47,682 --> 01:08:50,083
But you have many
enemies here. Is it not so?

590
01:08:51,786 --> 01:08:54,483
That is no concern of yours.

591
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:57,287
It may be.

592
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,128
If you would be
prepared in secret

593
01:09:01,129 --> 01:09:04,895
to renounce heresy
and embrace the true faith,

594
01:09:05,233 --> 01:09:09,932
then you might find
many new and powerful friends,

595
01:09:10,905 --> 01:09:15,274
and keep your Queen.

596
01:09:17,512 --> 01:09:20,277
You are most mistaken,
Monsignor,

597
01:09:20,815 --> 01:09:23,684
if you think I might
so easily be persuaded

598
01:09:23,685 --> 01:09:28,020
to act against my conscience
and my love.

599
01:09:28,223 --> 01:09:29,212
Ah.

600
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:30,989
My lord.

601
01:09:33,361 --> 01:09:35,955
What will a man not do
for love?

602
01:09:46,507 --> 01:09:49,807
Madam, if only
you would heed my advice.

603
01:09:50,078 --> 01:09:52,279
I narrowly escaped
with my life, sir.

604
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:55,716
I... I cannot now
discuss marriage.

605
01:09:56,885 --> 01:09:58,552
Forgive me.

606
01:09:58,553 --> 01:10:01,622
The one cannot be
separated from the other.

607
01:10:01,623 --> 01:10:03,056
Have I not told you?

608
01:10:03,057 --> 01:10:05,259
Yes! And I am sick of it.

609
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:09,094
This entire conversation
is ill-timed.

610
01:10:09,797 --> 01:10:13,393
My patience, Sir William,
is not infinite.

611
01:10:23,945 --> 01:10:27,108
It is a great joy to see
Your Majesty is not hurt.

612
01:10:27,749 --> 01:10:29,683
It was a terrible affair.

613
01:10:31,085 --> 01:10:34,715
The Duke would still know
the answer to his suit.

614
01:10:36,624 --> 01:10:40,193
You may tell the Duke that he
shall have his answer shortly.

615
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:43,997
Oh, madam!
The point is pressing.

616
01:10:43,998 --> 01:10:48,969
The Duke cannot love me so much if
he demands my answer so precipitously.

617
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:51,171
Perhaps Her Majesty
will not answer

618
01:10:51,172 --> 01:10:54,506
because her heart is
already set upon another.

619
01:10:56,978 --> 01:11:03,247
Do not presume, monsieur, to
know the secrets of my heart.

620
01:11:04,786 --> 01:11:06,811
Monsieur de Foix may leave.

621
01:11:07,288 --> 01:11:09,757
S'il vous platt, Excellency.

622
01:11:14,929 --> 01:11:16,829
Secrets, madam?

623
01:11:17,265 --> 01:11:19,427
You have no secrets!

624
01:11:19,634 --> 01:11:22,302
The world knows that Lord Robert
visits your chambers at night,

625
01:11:22,303 --> 01:11:25,739
and that you fornicate
with him!

626
01:11:25,873 --> 01:11:28,976
It's even said that
you already carry his child.

627
01:11:28,977 --> 01:11:31,545
Yes, Sir William,
I live my life in the open!

628
01:11:31,546 --> 01:11:34,081
I am surrounded by people!

629
01:11:34,082 --> 01:11:38,246
I do not understand how so bad
a judgment is being formed of me.

630
01:11:38,519 --> 01:11:42,047
Madam, you cannot
marry Lord Robert.

631
01:11:48,196 --> 01:11:49,993
He's already married.

632
01:12:11,586 --> 01:12:13,679
A married man.

633
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:15,115
Lord Dudley.

634
01:12:17,358 --> 01:12:18,348
Lord Dudley...

635
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:26,563
Imagine being discovered
in another woman's bed.

636
01:12:28,336 --> 01:12:30,031
You mean
his wife's bed.

637
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:44,718
Lord Robert, we are amazed
you show your face at court.

638
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:46,278
The Queen!

639
01:13:20,988 --> 01:13:22,047
Spanish!

640
01:13:22,423 --> 01:13:23,891
Spanish! Spanish!

641
01:13:27,095 --> 01:13:28,722
English pirate!

642
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,684
English pirate!

643
01:13:50,685 --> 01:13:54,178
It's not enough that English
pirates attack and rob our ships,

644
01:13:54,655 --> 01:13:57,591
but we have to be made
fools of in this court.

645
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,896
The King, my master, has become
impatient for Your Grace to act.

646
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:08,232
If you will not,
then others may.

647
01:14:10,204 --> 01:14:13,197
You must reassure His Majesty
that the time is close at hand.

648
01:14:13,908 --> 01:14:15,774
He must not act
precipitously.

649
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:17,510
English pirate!

650
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:21,381
His Majesty has also
heard a rumor.

651
01:14:21,382 --> 01:14:23,550
The world is filled
with rumors, Monsignor.

652
01:14:23,551 --> 01:14:26,219
That Your Grace has made
contact with Mary of Scots

653
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:28,120
to promote your ambitions.

654
01:14:29,857 --> 01:14:32,156
Even that you mean
to marry her.

655
01:14:32,393 --> 01:14:34,123
Do you suppose me an idiot?

656
01:14:35,463 --> 01:14:37,464
Your master is the most
powerful man in the world.

657
01:14:37,465 --> 01:14:39,126
I would not cross him
for my life.

658
01:14:46,908 --> 01:14:48,875
Did the Duke
not come to dance?

659
01:14:48,876 --> 01:14:51,411
Madam, His Grace is
unfortunately indisposed.

660
01:14:51,412 --> 01:14:53,403
He has some pains
of the stomach.

661
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:57,342
Oh. I am very sorry for it.

662
01:15:05,693 --> 01:15:08,594
We wish to give
the Duke this ring

663
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:10,829
as a token of our love.

664
01:15:11,666 --> 01:15:13,293
Madam, allow me...
No.

665
01:15:13,901 --> 01:15:16,302
I shall give it to him myself.

666
01:15:17,839 --> 01:15:20,774
Madam, I should not...
Sir William.

667
01:15:21,042 --> 01:15:22,407
Come along.

668
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:31,705
What?

669
01:16:33,447 --> 01:16:34,779
What?

670
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,208
What? What?

671
01:16:44,025 --> 01:16:45,652
You stare, madame.

672
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:55,893
What is it? Do you see
something strange, perhaps?

673
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,932
You are wearing a dress,
Your Grace.

674
01:17:02,843 --> 01:17:04,144
Oh.

675
01:17:04,145 --> 01:17:07,514
Yes, I am wearing a dress.
Yes, yes, I am wearing a dress.

676
01:17:07,515 --> 01:17:10,678
I wear a dress like this,
my mother, and you.

677
01:17:10,818 --> 01:17:15,346
But I only dress like this when I'm
alone, in private with my friends.

678
01:17:17,725 --> 01:17:19,090
Your Grace.

679
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:42,549
Although my affection for you
is undiminished,

680
01:17:43,217 --> 01:17:46,786
I have, after
an agonizing struggle,

681
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:50,952
determined to sacrifice my own
happiness for the welfare of my people.

682
01:17:51,225 --> 01:17:52,693
Oh! My God.

683
01:18:00,067 --> 01:18:01,694
Madam, I will explain.

684
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:32,665
Madam, is the Duke...

685
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:35,261
There will be
no more talk of marriage.

686
01:18:55,256 --> 01:18:56,621
Lord Robert!

687
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,228
Your Majesty.

688
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:06,022
Will you dance?

689
01:19:08,736 --> 01:19:10,363
If it please you.

690
01:19:16,944 --> 01:19:18,412
Play a volta.

691
01:19:34,462 --> 01:19:36,123
Why will you not see me?

692
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:54,408
You must let me explain. Others
will take advantage of this.

693
01:19:55,049 --> 01:19:57,016
You must not believe
what they tell you.

694
01:19:57,017 --> 01:19:58,747
They are jealous.

695
01:19:58,886 --> 01:20:00,786
And envious.

696
01:20:01,188 --> 01:20:05,091
Because I am nothing to them,
and everything to you.

697
01:20:05,593 --> 01:20:07,618
Do you love her?

698
01:20:12,166 --> 01:20:15,135
No. I love you.
I have always loved you.

699
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:17,601
I was afraid of losing you,
because I was not free.

700
01:20:18,906 --> 01:20:21,705
For God's sake,
you are still my Elizabeth.

701
01:20:23,043 --> 01:20:26,707
No. I am not your Elizabeth!

702
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:30,915
I am no man's Elizabeth.

703
01:20:31,151 --> 01:20:34,417
And if you think to rule her,
you are mistaken.

704
01:20:40,694 --> 01:20:42,890
I will have one mistress here!

705
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,891
And no master!

706
01:21:19,266 --> 01:21:23,601
It matters nothing to me.
I can live without her.

707
01:21:24,071 --> 01:21:25,539
Most happily.

708
01:21:26,473 --> 01:21:28,874
Better than I could
live with her.

709
01:21:30,945 --> 01:21:33,038
I have no need of her love.

710
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:35,949
Have not I
suffered enough already,

711
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:38,484
for loving her and showing it?

712
01:21:38,485 --> 01:21:43,082
I envy you, my lord,
to love a woman so deeply.

713
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:48,185
Monsignor,
envy no man for that.

714
01:21:50,264 --> 01:21:53,598
Such love is hateful.
It tears the soul apart.

715
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:57,694
Envy a man who has
never known such love.

716
01:21:58,439 --> 01:22:02,041
Perhaps there may still be a
way to reclaim her affections.

717
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:03,309
Why should I want to?

718
01:22:03,310 --> 01:22:05,108
And to save her life.

719
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:08,171
You jest with me.
No. Indeed, I do not.

720
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:10,550
For she will be
dead soon enough,

721
01:22:10,551 --> 01:22:14,920
perhaps even at Norfolk's
hand, if you do not help her.

722
01:22:17,491 --> 01:22:23,396
How can I help her?
She will not even see me.

723
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:33,406
His Holiness
has issued the bull.

724
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:36,909
It deprives Elizabeth, the
pretended Queen of England,

725
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:39,675
servant of wickedness,
of her throne,

726
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:46,217
and declares that henceforth her subjects
are absolved of their allegiance to her.

727
01:22:48,455 --> 01:22:52,256
His Holiness also
decrees that any man

728
01:22:52,493 --> 01:22:56,095
who should undertake
her assassination

729
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:59,532
will be welcomed by angels
into the kingdom of heaven.

730
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:05,531
Give these letters of blessing
and hope to our friends in England.

731
01:23:53,954 --> 01:23:55,319
Your Grace.

732
01:23:55,989 --> 01:23:57,321
Monsignor.

733
01:24:07,434 --> 01:24:09,061
And Thomas Elyot.

734
01:24:12,773 --> 01:24:14,841
You serve
your master well, Elyot.

735
01:24:14,842 --> 01:24:16,867
As good as I can, in truth.

736
01:24:17,544 --> 01:24:19,444
I mean your real master.

737
01:24:21,248 --> 01:24:22,647
What's this?

738
01:24:24,551 --> 01:24:25,951
What master?

739
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:28,052
Walsingham.

740
01:24:28,422 --> 01:24:30,288
The priest is mistaken,
my lord.

741
01:24:30,424 --> 01:24:33,519
I am Your Grace's servant,
as God is my witness.

742
01:25:19,006 --> 01:25:20,473
Isabel, they are...

743
01:25:20,908 --> 01:25:22,808
Don't fuss.

744
01:25:27,381 --> 01:25:31,044
You should not try them on, Isabel.
They are the Queen's dresses.

745
01:25:31,285 --> 01:25:33,253
Why not?

746
01:26:26,173 --> 01:26:27,740
I must see the Queen.

747
01:26:27,741 --> 01:26:29,209
I am Queen of England.

748
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:31,277
Tell her I must see her.

749
01:26:31,278 --> 01:26:33,144
Say you're mine.

750
01:26:34,748 --> 01:26:36,682
You're my Elizabeth.

751
01:26:37,117 --> 01:26:40,018
Say you are my Elizabeth.

752
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,084
I am your Elizabeth.

753
01:26:49,263 --> 01:26:50,560
I am your Queen.

754
01:27:29,136 --> 01:27:30,626
Kat!

755
01:27:33,407 --> 01:27:34,465
Kat!

756
01:27:48,722 --> 01:27:49,746
Kat?

757
01:27:59,166 --> 01:28:01,032
Who are you?

758
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:05,034
You will declare yourself
to me.

759
01:28:10,978 --> 01:28:13,242
Madam!

760
01:28:14,448 --> 01:28:17,349
Come quickly. Something has
happened. You must come quickly.

761
01:28:18,785 --> 01:28:19,885
Who was with her?

762
01:28:19,886 --> 01:28:22,655
One of the guards found her.
No one was with her.

763
01:28:22,656 --> 01:28:24,757
He said he saw
Lord Robert leave.

764
01:28:24,758 --> 01:28:27,293
No. No, no, madam, no.

765
01:28:27,294 --> 01:28:29,160
The dress was poisoned.

766
01:28:29,830 --> 01:28:31,229
Uncover her.

767
01:28:35,802 --> 01:28:37,896
No! That dress was a gift.

768
01:28:39,506 --> 01:28:40,701
For me.

769
01:28:42,576 --> 01:28:44,544
French silk.

770
01:29:24,084 --> 01:29:25,574
Sir Francis.

771
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:30,613
You and I, we must be
honest with each other.

772
01:29:36,129 --> 01:29:37,859
Your Queen is weak.

773
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:44,194
She has no army,
no friends, only...

774
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:47,740
Enemies.

775
01:29:47,741 --> 01:29:49,004
Enemies.
Mmm-hmm.

776
01:29:50,777 --> 01:29:53,446
What terms can she propose?

777
01:29:53,447 --> 01:29:55,506
Madam, Her Majesty was,
I believe,

778
01:29:55,949 --> 01:29:59,283
too hasty at rejecting the
Duke's proposal of marriage.

779
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:04,423
But how can I marry such a
woman? Huh? She is frigid.

780
01:30:05,792 --> 01:30:06,850
Yes.

781
01:30:07,661 --> 01:30:09,993
They even say
she's really a man.

782
01:30:15,769 --> 01:30:17,601
Oh, you must
forgive my nephew.

783
01:30:18,672 --> 01:30:22,040
He speaks when
he should not. It's terrible.

784
01:30:43,630 --> 01:30:46,258
I hear you are a wise man,
Sir Francis,

785
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:50,871
and a creature of the world.

786
01:30:51,138 --> 01:30:52,162
Like me.

787
01:30:58,612 --> 01:30:59,670
Yes.

788
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,515
I have no illusions.

789
01:31:08,955 --> 01:31:11,322
I know it is only
a matter of time

790
01:31:12,659 --> 01:31:14,855
before my Queen is overthrown.

791
01:31:19,933 --> 01:31:22,368
Her Majesty rules
with the heart.

792
01:31:25,005 --> 01:31:26,632
Not with the head.

793
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:29,008
I understand.

794
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:33,908
It is hard for a woman
to forget her heart.

795
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:41,517
But what of you,

796
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:44,821
Walsingham?

797
01:31:48,228 --> 01:31:52,688
A wise man would be careful not
to put himself in the way of harm.

798
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:53,956
Hmm.

799
01:31:54,834 --> 01:31:58,293
And how would
a wise man do that?

800
01:31:58,672 --> 01:32:02,199
He would, as I said,
change allegiance.

801
01:32:09,950 --> 01:32:11,679
There are but two choices.

802
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:17,882
He would get into bed
with either Spain or France.

803
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:24,492
And whose bed
would you prefer?

804
01:32:41,648 --> 01:32:44,618
Your Majesty,
may I speak with you

805
01:32:46,253 --> 01:32:47,618
in private?

806
01:32:56,963 --> 01:32:58,795
Speak.

807
01:33:00,066 --> 01:33:02,296
You are
in the greatest danger.

808
01:33:03,203 --> 01:33:04,966
You must believe me.

809
01:33:06,906 --> 01:33:12,470
But you have a friend, someone
who can guarantee your safety

810
01:33:13,513 --> 01:33:15,106
and your throne.

811
01:33:19,286 --> 01:33:20,548
A friend?

812
01:33:23,757 --> 01:33:25,418
The King of Spain.

813
01:33:29,930 --> 01:33:31,192
Leave us.

814
01:33:42,609 --> 01:33:44,077
How would he guarantee it?

815
01:33:48,448 --> 01:33:50,177
He would marry you.

816
01:33:52,986 --> 01:33:56,388
Only to make an alliance,
nothing more.

817
01:33:58,625 --> 01:34:00,525
He would not expect to...

818
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:03,627
He would live in Spain.

819
01:34:05,632 --> 01:34:07,657
Why do you do this, Robert?

820
01:34:08,702 --> 01:34:10,431
Because I love you,

821
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:16,408
and though you will not see me, I am
the only one who would care for you.

822
01:34:16,409 --> 01:34:20,746
You love me so much, you
would have me be your whore?

823
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:30,051
For God's sake,
I do this for us.

824
01:34:30,523 --> 01:34:33,392
I ask you to save
some part of us!

825
01:34:33,393 --> 01:34:37,162
Lord Robert, you may make
whores of my ladies,

826
01:34:37,163 --> 01:34:39,496
but you shall not
make one of me.

827
01:34:49,275 --> 01:34:50,436
Your Majesty.

828
01:35:27,514 --> 01:35:29,072
Of course, I shall deny it!

829
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:32,944
But Your Majesty must
publicly dissociate herself

830
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,148
from this most bloody act.

831
01:35:36,489 --> 01:35:37,786
I never ordered it.

832
01:35:41,094 --> 01:35:43,187
Of course, madam, of course.

833
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:46,966
You must also make conciliatory
gestures towards the Spanish.

834
01:35:47,567 --> 01:35:52,604
Your dependence upon their
goodwill is even greater than ever.

835
01:35:52,605 --> 01:35:56,906
I really must insist... The word
"must" is not used to princes.

836
01:36:01,247 --> 01:36:04,809
I have followed your advice in
all the affairs of my kingdom,

837
01:36:06,286 --> 01:36:08,187
but your policies would make
England nothing

838
01:36:08,188 --> 01:36:10,588
but either part of France
or Spain.

839
01:36:13,993 --> 01:36:17,529
From this moment, I am going
to follow my own opinion,

840
01:36:17,530 --> 01:36:18,597
and see if I do any better.

841
01:36:18,598 --> 01:36:20,365
Forgive me, madam,
but you're only a woman.

842
01:36:20,366 --> 01:36:23,666
I may be a woman, Sir William, but if
I choose, I have the heart of a man.

843
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:31,233
I am my father's daughter.

844
01:36:32,645 --> 01:36:34,739
I am not afraid of anything.

845
01:36:36,182 --> 01:36:37,240
I...

846
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:41,618
I deeply regret, madam,

847
01:36:42,655 --> 01:36:45,022
if I have caused you
such offense.

848
01:36:46,326 --> 01:36:50,558
Though God knows all my advice
has only ever been

849
01:36:53,466 --> 01:36:55,730
to secure
Your Majesty's throne.

850
01:36:56,436 --> 01:36:58,404
And I am grateful for it.

851
01:37:05,011 --> 01:37:09,244
I have decided to
create you Lord Burghley,

852
01:37:09,716 --> 01:37:12,184
so you may enjoy your
retirement in greater ease.

853
01:37:12,185 --> 01:37:13,318
Madam...

854
01:37:13,319 --> 01:37:15,618
That will be all,
Lord Burghley.

855
01:37:24,197 --> 01:37:25,426
Majesty.

856
01:37:54,561 --> 01:37:56,153
Madam, if I may.

857
01:37:58,231 --> 01:38:01,033
A prince should never flinch
from being blamed

858
01:38:01,034 --> 01:38:02,467
for acts of ruthlessness

859
01:38:03,202 --> 01:38:06,195
which are necessary
for safeguarding the state

860
01:38:07,473 --> 01:38:09,271
and their own person.

861
01:38:11,411 --> 01:38:13,979
You must take these things
so much to heart

862
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:16,005
that you do not fear
to strike.

863
01:38:17,417 --> 01:38:20,011
Even the very nearest
that you have.

864
01:38:22,121 --> 01:38:23,953
If they be implicated.

865
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:29,253
It has been made known to me

866
01:38:30,163 --> 01:38:33,360
there is a priest abroad in the
land carrying letters from Rome

867
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:36,434
to those who mean to harm you.

868
01:38:39,505 --> 01:38:41,974
Norfolk's power in court
is growing.

869
01:38:43,109 --> 01:38:45,611
It is said that he and his
foreign allies are raising

870
01:38:45,612 --> 01:38:48,979
an army that will
outnumber your own.

871
01:38:49,315 --> 01:38:53,377
If Your Majesty does not
act soon, then he will.

872
01:38:56,222 --> 01:38:58,987
Find the priest
and those who harbor him.

873
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:04,028
All right! Search
every room! You, upstairs!

874
01:39:05,264 --> 01:39:07,392
I will see everybody
in this house!

875
01:39:16,309 --> 01:39:18,175
Where is Lord Arundel?

876
01:39:22,482 --> 01:39:24,211
He's not here, sir.

877
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:36,759
Do you know
where your father is?

878
01:40:23,576 --> 01:40:26,411
You were carrying
letters from the Pope.

879
01:40:26,412 --> 01:40:28,403
To whom were you
told to give them?

880
01:40:40,026 --> 01:40:41,255
Tell me,

881
01:40:42,729 --> 01:40:44,458
what is God to you?

882
01:40:46,799 --> 01:40:48,597
Has he abandoned you?

883
01:40:50,036 --> 01:40:52,404
Is he such a worldly God
that he must play at politics

884
01:40:52,405 --> 01:40:54,373
and the filth of conspiracy?

885
01:40:56,342 --> 01:40:58,834
Is he not divine?

886
01:41:00,279 --> 01:41:01,713
Tell me the truth

887
01:41:02,415 --> 01:41:04,611
as if you were face to face
with him now.

888
01:41:08,788 --> 01:41:10,847
I'm a patient man, Father.

889
01:41:24,737 --> 01:41:29,573
Sussex, Gardiner, Arundel.

890
01:41:30,676 --> 01:41:36,013
A man will confess to anything
under torture.

891
01:41:38,785 --> 01:41:41,618
And Lord Robert Dudley,
Earl of Leicester.

892
01:42:01,274 --> 01:42:05,939
Madam, this document was also found
among the priest's possessions.

893
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:09,080
"From His Holiness, the Pope,

894
01:42:09,682 --> 01:42:12,117
"to His Grace,
the Duke of Norfolk.

895
01:42:16,456 --> 01:42:19,391
"To legitimize your claim
to the throne of England,

896
01:42:20,026 --> 01:42:23,655
"His Holiness proposes that Your
Grace should take as your bride

897
01:42:24,063 --> 01:42:25,997
"Mary, Queen of Scots,

898
01:42:25,998 --> 01:42:27,232
"and overthrow Elizabeth... "

899
01:42:27,233 --> 01:42:30,328
"The illegitimate
and heretical whore

900
01:42:31,637 --> 01:42:33,538
"who now sits
upon the throne. "

901
01:42:33,539 --> 01:42:37,305
All Norfolk need do
is sign this paper,

902
01:42:38,811 --> 01:42:41,405
and treason would have
been committed.

903
01:42:42,882 --> 01:42:44,748
Then let him sign it.

904
01:42:47,186 --> 01:42:49,052
And let it all be done.

905
01:43:09,942 --> 01:43:11,433
In the future,

906
01:43:12,578 --> 01:43:15,275
when England is safe
again and faithful,

907
01:43:16,048 --> 01:43:19,450
they will thank me for this
act and forget the manner of it.

908
01:43:22,688 --> 01:43:24,452
Is it not true?

909
01:43:52,585 --> 01:43:54,849
Deliver this most carefully.

910
01:47:37,643 --> 01:47:39,304
What is the meaning of this?

911
01:47:41,447 --> 01:47:42,947
Your Grace is arrested.

912
01:47:42,948 --> 01:47:44,949
You must go with these men
to the Tower.

913
01:47:44,950 --> 01:47:47,886
I must do nothing
by your orders. I am Norfolk.

914
01:47:48,387 --> 01:47:50,014
You were Norfolk.

915
01:47:52,057 --> 01:47:53,958
The dead have no titles.

916
01:48:02,701 --> 01:48:05,569
You were the most powerful man
in England.

917
01:48:07,907 --> 01:48:10,171
And could have been
greater still,

918
01:48:10,676 --> 01:48:13,543
but you had not the courage
to be loyal.

919
01:48:15,581 --> 01:48:18,846
Only the conviction
of your own vanity.

920
01:48:20,152 --> 01:48:23,349
I think, Walsingham, a man's courage
is in the manner of his death.

921
01:48:26,058 --> 01:48:28,550
I'm content to die
for my beliefs.

922
01:48:30,896 --> 01:48:35,299
So cut off my head
and make me a martyr.

923
01:48:36,702 --> 01:48:39,137
The people will always
remember it.

924
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:41,964
No.

925
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:45,937
They will forget.

926
01:48:48,781 --> 01:48:52,444
Your Majesty knows that...

927
01:48:53,285 --> 01:48:55,584
That I did it
only for my faith.

928
01:48:57,089 --> 01:48:58,456
Nothing more.

929
01:49:01,460 --> 01:49:05,055
All your many kindnesses
are remembered.

930
01:49:12,538 --> 01:49:15,598
You must not think
we care not for your children.

931
01:49:18,878 --> 01:49:22,439
Your Majesty is merciful
and forgiving.

932
01:49:41,133 --> 01:49:43,124
What kept you, Walsingham?

933
01:49:46,138 --> 01:49:47,765
I've been waiting.

934
01:50:01,387 --> 01:50:02,854
Your Majesty.

935
01:50:03,088 --> 01:50:05,614
They're all gone to the Tower,

936
01:50:05,791 --> 01:50:07,259
your friends.

937
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:16,231
Tell me,

938
01:50:19,371 --> 01:50:22,830
how should I serve thee,
Robert?

939
01:50:29,748 --> 01:50:31,375
My course is run.

940
01:50:35,054 --> 01:50:37,284
Just tell me why.

941
01:50:39,692 --> 01:50:40,750
Why?

942
01:50:44,229 --> 01:50:45,458
Madam.

943
01:50:49,768 --> 01:50:53,398
Is it not plain enough to you?

944
01:50:56,075 --> 01:51:01,741
It is no easy thing
to be loved by the Queen.

945
01:51:06,652 --> 01:51:09,280
It would corrupt
the soul of any man.

946
01:51:13,225 --> 01:51:15,319
Now, for God's sake, kill me.

947
01:51:20,366 --> 01:51:21,390
No.

948
01:51:23,802 --> 01:51:26,032
I think rather
to let you live.

949
01:51:27,172 --> 01:51:29,974
Madam, that is not wise.

950
01:51:29,975 --> 01:51:32,310
Lord Robert has
committed treason.

951
01:51:32,311 --> 01:51:33,745
He must be made example of.

952
01:51:33,746 --> 01:51:36,681
And I will make
an example of him.

953
01:51:42,321 --> 01:51:44,813
He shall be kept alive

954
01:51:46,792 --> 01:51:48,521
to always remind me

955
01:51:50,829 --> 01:51:53,025
of how close I came to danger.

956
01:52:53,992 --> 01:52:57,019
I have rid England
of her enemies.

957
01:52:58,764 --> 01:53:00,391
What do I do now?

958
01:53:01,767 --> 01:53:03,735
Am I to be made of stone?

959
01:53:06,338 --> 01:53:08,873
Must I be touched by nothing?

960
01:53:08,874 --> 01:53:11,673
Aye, madam. To reign supreme.

961
01:53:13,479 --> 01:53:15,546
All men need something
greater than themselves

962
01:53:15,547 --> 01:53:17,538
to look up to and worship.

963
01:53:27,593 --> 01:53:30,289
They must be able
to touch the divine...

964
01:53:33,532 --> 01:53:35,022
Here on earth.

965
01:53:43,375 --> 01:53:46,675
She had such power
over men's hearts.

966
01:53:52,551 --> 01:53:54,212
They died for her.

967
01:53:56,522 --> 01:53:59,457
They have found nothing
to replace her.

968
01:55:32,651 --> 01:55:34,449
You will be damned for this.

969
01:55:36,688 --> 01:55:39,214
Tonight I think I die.

970
01:55:39,625 --> 01:55:40,683
Speak up!

971
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:23,061
Kat.

972
01:56:30,242 --> 01:56:32,608
I have become a virgin.

973
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:37,541
Observe, Lord Burghley.

974
01:57:41,113 --> 01:57:42,842
I am married.

975
01:57:44,049 --> 01:57:45,949
To England.
