1
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,162
What's this war in the heart of nature?

2
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,210
Why does nature vie with itself?

3
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,047
The land contend with the sea?

4
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:25,269
Is there an avenging power in nature?

5
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,650
Not one power, but two?

6
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:25,723
I remember my mother when she was dying.

7
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,100
She looked all shrunk up and gray.

8
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,732
I asked her if she was afraid.

9
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,277
She just shook her head.

10
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,448
I was afraid to touch the death
I seen in her.

11
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,078
I couldn't find nothing
beautiful or uplifting...

12
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,538
about her going back to God.

13
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,461
I heard people talk about immortality.

14
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,505
But I ain't seen it.

15
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,950
I wondered how it'd be when I died.

16
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,246
What it'd be like to know
that this breath now...

17
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,082
was the last one you was ever gonna draw.

18
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,839
I just hope I can meet it
the same way she did...

19
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,218
with the same calm.

20
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,140
'Cause that's where it's hidden...

21
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,809
the immortality I hadn't seen.

22
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:18,104
Kids around here never fight.

23
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,231
Sometimes.

24
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,234
Sometimes when you see them playing.

25
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,612
They always fight.

26
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,867
- Is she afraid of me?
- Little bit.

27
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,622
- Are you afraid of me?
- Yes.

28
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,333
- Why?
- 'Cause you look...

29
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,295
You look as an army.

30
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,339
- I look army.
- Yes.

31
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,469
Well, that don't matter.

32
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,889
It doesn't matter.

33
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,603
- Baby's tired.
- Yes.

34
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,565
If she swims, she wants, she will sleep.

35
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,013
Okay.

36
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:37,391
There you go.
Go, go, go, go. Go.

37
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,144
Go, go, go. Go!

38
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,375
Witt, patrol boat.
She's American.

39
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,055
What's it doing out here all alone?

40
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,251
You haven't changed at all,
have you, Witt?

41
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,296
You haven't learned a thing.

42
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:18,719
All a man has to do is leave it to you,
you put your head in the noose for him.

43
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,186
How many times you been AWOL?

44
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,441
You been in the army,
what, six years now?

45
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:36,820
Ain't it about time you smartened up
and stopped being such a punk recruit?

46
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,114
I mean, if you're ever gonna.

47
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,116
We can't all be smart.

48
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,537
No, we can't. That's a shame.

49
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,581
Look at you.

50
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:56,590
Truth is, you can't take
straight duty in my company.

51
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,219
You'll never be a real soldier.

52
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,262
Not in God's world.

53
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,935
This is C Company, of which I'm first sergeant.
I run this outfit.

54
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,563
Now, Captain Staros, he's the C.O.,
but I'm the guy that runs it.

55
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,149
Nobody's gonna foul that up.

56
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,527
You're just another mouth for me to feed.

57
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,532
Normally you'd be court-martialed.

58
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:26,912
But I worked a deal for ya.
You oughta consider yourself lucky.

59
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,209
I'm sending you to a disciplinary outfit.

60
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,420
You'll be a stretcher bearer.

61
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,964
You'll be taking care of the wounded.

62
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,135
I can take anything you dish out.

63
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,470
I'm twice the man you are.

64
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,818
In this world...

65
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,696
a man himself...

66
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,781
is nothin'.

67
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,455
And there ain't no world but this one.

68
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,209
You're wrong there, Top.

69
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,131
I seen another world.

70
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:28,515
Sometimes I think
it was just my imagination.

71
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,270
Well...

72
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,564
then you've seen things I never will.

73
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,536
We're living in a world that's blowing itself
to hell as fast as everybody can arrange it.

74
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:56,168
In a situation like that, all a man can do
is shut his eyes and let nothing touch him.

75
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,213
Look out for himself.

76
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,894
I might be the best friend you ever had.

77
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,398
You don't even know it.

78
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,099
He hates you worse than poison.

79
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,356
I never felt he hated me.

80
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,358
'Cause I don't hate him.

81
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,442
I love Charlie Company.

82
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,449
They're my people.

83
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:19,102
They call it "The Rock."
Now, nobody wants this island.

84
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,648
The Japs just put an airfield there.
All the fighting's confined to this area.

85
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,609
As you can see, this is
their road to Australia...

86
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,236
and this is their way of controlling
the sea lanes to America.

87
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,238
Now, if we're gonna stop
the Japs' advance...

88
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,659
into the South Pacific,
we've got to do it right there.

89
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,205
The marines have done their job.
Now it's our turn.

90
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,293
Worked my ass off.

91
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:45,337
Brown-nosed the generals.

92
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,675
Degraded myself...

93
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,221
for them, for my family...

94
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,724
my home.

95
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,187
- I admire you, Colonel. I do.
- Thank you, sir.

96
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,398
Most men your age
would have retired by now.

97
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,859
It's okay.

98
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:11,071
We need general officers
with maturity and character like you.

99
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:15,450
We've got good sergeants.
We've got good lieutenant colonels.

100
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,829
But once a man gets those eagles...
He can't wait to get that star.

101
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,164
Can he? He becomes a politician, right?

102
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,916
Goes along to get along.

103
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,296
So goddamn hard to stay upright.

104
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:32,342
- You said it there, sir.
- With the admiral watching, which he will be.

105
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,761
There's always someone watching you.

106
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,140
Like a hawk.

107
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,017
Always someone
ready to jump in if you're not.

108
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,698
Do you have a son, Colonel?

109
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,324
- Yes, sir. I do.
- Good.

110
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,326
'Cause we don't want our sons
or our grandsons...

111
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,370
fighting this war
30 years from now, do we?

112
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,039
- No, sir. We sure don't.
- Then you crush 'em without mercy.

113
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:07,169
You... You dig them out of the hills
and protect that airfield.

114
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,087
Yes, sir.

115
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,174
Do you wonder why... why did they...

116
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,969
Why did the Japs put an airfield there,
of all places?

117
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,555
I guess we don't know
the bigger picture though, do we?

118
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,599
If there is such a thing.
What do you think?

119
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,894
- Well, sir, I never asked myself that question.
- Mmm.

120
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,480
You're a humble man.

121
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,776
Nobody wants that island, but you.

122
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,529
How much do you want it?

123
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,823
As much as I have to, sir.

124
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,788
All they sacrificed for me...

125
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,710
poured out like water on the ground.

126
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,677
All I might have given for love's sake.

127
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,443
Too late.

128
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,367
Dyin'...

129
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,371
slow as a tree.

130
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,292
You feel it?

131
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,877
Yes, sir.

132
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,133
Thank you, sir.

133
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,732
Take topside to the signal bridge.

134
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:03,577
The closer you are to Caesar,
the greater the fear.

135
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:19,426
I just can't help how damn
scared I am, Sarge, all right?

136
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,596
I just can't help how damn
scared I am, Sarge, all right?

137
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,765
I can't help it. I got...

138
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,185
You know, my stepdaddy took a block
and beat me when I was real little.

139
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,105
And I... I was scared.
And I used to run. I used to hide.

140
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:35,817
Hell, I slept in a chicken coop
a whole lot of nights.

141
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,111
And...

142
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,530
I never thought it'd get
no worse than that.

143
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,076
But I'm living by the... by the minute over here.
I'm counting the seconds.

144
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,578
- Yeah.
- And we're gonna be landing...

145
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,831
We're gonna be landing soon.
There's gonna be air raids.

146
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,542
We're probably gonna die
before we get off the beach.

147
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:57,297
This place is...
It's like a big floating graveyard.

148
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:01,384
- What's your name, kid?
- I want to own an automobile when I get out.

149
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,889
- What's your name?
- Edward... Edward B. Train.

150
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:06,973
Train.

151
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:11,895
The only things that are permanent is...
is dying and the Lord.

152
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,064
That's it.
That's all you got to worry about.

153
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,524
This war ain't...
This war ain't gonna be the end of me.

154
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,945
- And it ain't gonna be the end of you neither.
- Think we'll catch an air raid?

155
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,947
How in the hell should I know?

156
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:26,826
All's I know is them crew guys said they didn't
catch no air raid the last time they made this run.

157
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,747
On the other hand, time before last,
they nearly got blew up.

158
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,959
- What do you want me to tell you?
- You're a big help, Tills.

159
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:37,087
Nothing. Tell me nothing.
Tell you something.

160
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:41,091
We're sitting out here on this ocean like a
couple of fuckin' ducks in these here boats.

161
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,927
- That's what.
- I already know that.

162
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,055
Well, brood on it, Tills.
Brood on it.

163
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,601
- Ain't you watching the fun?
- Ain't interested.

164
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:55,981
- Yeah, I guess it is pretty crowded.
- Wouldn't be interested even if it wasn't.

165
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,984
Well, I'm on my way
to get me that pistol.

166
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:02,904
- Yeah? Well, have fun.
- Yeah, have fun.

167
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,906
You'll wish you had one
once we get ashore...

168
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,908
and run into
some of them samurai sabers.

169
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:11,788
Open this door!
Open this goddamn door!

170
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,540
Open the door!

171
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:19,295
I learned to deal these cards before...

172
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,257
All right. Here I am sleeping.

173
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,675
Yeah.

174
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,303
All right, ladies.
Is this a sewing circle or a card game?

175
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:31,182
- All right, jacks high, jack bet.
- Robert's got two jacks.

176
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,938
I never bargained for nothing like this
when I signed up for this man's army...

177
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,065
back in the Bronx before the war.

178
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,943
How was I supposed to know
there was gonna be a fuckin' war?

179
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,945
Answer me that.

180
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,785
All I know is old Charlie Company's
always gettin' screwed. Always.

181
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,913
And I can tell you
whose fault it is too.

182
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,915
It's that captain of ours.

183
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,002
First he gets us stuck off on this boat,
clear away from our own outfit...

184
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,004
where we don't know a fucking soul.

185
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,841
Then he gets us stuck way down...

186
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,941
Hello, Captain.

187
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:10,281
Read in your 201 file
you were an officer before the war.

188
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:12,575
How'd you end up a private?

189
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,286
'Cause of my wife.

190
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,580
I was in the Corps of Engineers.

191
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:22,252
We'd never been separated before.

192
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,754
Not even for a night.

193
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,757
I...I took it for four months...

194
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:30,510
and then I quit.

195
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,512
Just resigned.

196
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:36,599
Th-They... They sent me back to the States.

197
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,853
They told me I'd never get
another commission.

198
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:44,691
They said they'd see to it I got drafted and
that I for damn sure'd be in the infantry.

199
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,820
Sons of bitches.

200
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,864
No, I don't blame them.

201
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,493
Well, where is she now?

202
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,496
She's home.

203
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,887
Why should I be afraid to die?

204
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:20,476
I belong to you.

205
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,354
Move! Move! Move!

206
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,773
Move! Move!

207
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,366
Move, move! Movin' out!

208
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:39,412
If I go first, I'll wait for you there...

209
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,208
on the other side of the dark waters.

210
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,425
Put your helmet on.

211
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,762
Be with me now.

212
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,399
- Feeling the pressure, Captain?
- Yes, sir.

213
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,195
I like you, Captain.

214
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,407
And I just want you to know... well, we're
in this thing together. All right?

215
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,328
You keep pressing inland
till you reach the line.

216
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,330
- I'll catch up with you there.
- Yes, sir.

217
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,291
It's all yours, Captain. Gangway!

218
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:28,086
Gangway, there! Coming through!

219
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,880
Squad leaders! Both teams!

220
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:33,049
This way, son. This way.
Right here.

221
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,511
Stand by to go inside!

222
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,420
Our Father who art in heaven...

223
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:56,382
- And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
- Okay.

224
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,719
For Thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory.

225
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:16,778
Your outfit's lucky.
Transports must've been spotted.

226
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:20,031
You're getting out of here just
ahead of time. You're lucky.

227
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,919
Ho! Ho! Ho! Take a breath, mister!
You gotta breathe!

228
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,826
- Are you Charlie Company?
- Yeah.

229
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,869
We went in about a mile, sir.
There ain't nothing there.

230
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:09,497
Some oil drums, a burned-out spot.
There'd be nothing there for at least...

231
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,957
- About a week.
- About a week, sir.

232
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,793
But we didn't spot any casualties.
Japs must have hauled ass.

233
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,629
Couple of mortars hit the beach,
but most of the guys came in standing up.

234
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,674
Darnedest thing I ever did see, sir.

235
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,010
They got fish that live in trees.

236
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,143
Oh, if they didn't know this beach
was deserted, what else don't they know?

237
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,572
Who are you who live in
all these many forms?

238
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,607
Your death that captures all.

239
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:51,659
You too are the source
of all that's gonna be born.

240
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,685
Your glory...

241
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,149
mercy...

242
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:26,652
peace...

243
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,197
truth.

244
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:40,082
You give calm a spirit...

245
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,712
understanding...

246
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:48,674
courage.

247
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,640
The contented heart.

248
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,945
- Blankets.
- We need a medic now!

249
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,578
Maybe all men got one big soul...

250
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,788
who everybody's a part of.

251
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,918
All faces of the same man.

252
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,255
One big self.

253
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:33,792
Everyone looking for
salvation by himself...

254
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,760
each like a coal...

255
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,137
drawn from the fire.

256
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,505
We're going straight up that hill there.

257
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,886
We can't do that, Colonel.

258
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,888
Well, there's no way to outflank 'em.

259
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:30,766
Now, on the left there's a cliff
that falls straight down into the river.

260
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,395
The Japanese hold the jungle.
It has to be taken frontally.

261
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,441
What about water, sir?
Water's not getting up here.

262
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:42,277
My men are... passing out, sir.

263
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:53,080
Only time you worry about a soldier
is when he stops bitchin'.

264
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,805
We're all gonna attack abreast,
3rd platoon in reserve.

265
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:13,934
We've got to cross those three
folds of ground. You see?

266
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,688
Once we get beyond that,
we gotta attack that hill.

267
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:31,660
Colonel says there's no
way to outflank it...

268
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:34,538
so we gotta take it head-on
by frontal assault.

269
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,250
- Whyte?
- Yeah?

270
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,836
- You see those grassy ridges at the foot of that hill?
- Yeah.

271
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,838
When you get to the end of that field...

272
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,924
you're to locate and eliminate all the
hidden strong points on those ridges.

273
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,890
I'm sure the Japs got something there
to protect the approaches.

274
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:49,488
Are you here?

275
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,963
Let me not betray you.

276
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,677
Let me not betray my men.

277
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:22,187
In you, I place my trust.

278
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:37,786
Eos Rotodoctolos...

279
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:40,080
Rosy-fingered dawn.

280
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,667
You're Greek, aren't you, Captain?

281
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,961
Did you ever read Homer?

282
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,547
We read Homer at the Point.

283
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,008
In Greek.

284
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,927
What kind of
artillery support do we have, sir? Over.

285
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:57,055
Two batteries of 105s.

286
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,851
- They won't make a dent in that position. Over.
- No, but it bucks the men up.

287
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,187
It'll look like the Japs are catching hell.

288
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,619
Okay, you guys. This is it.

289
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:04,665
We're going down in groups of 10.

290
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:08,126
There's no point in going by in rushes.
We'll only make a better target stopped.

291
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,588
Run all the way.

292
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:13,215
We ain't got no choice.

293
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,259
We're picked, so we gotta go.

294
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,347
I'm gonna take the first bunch myself.

295
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,766
I want Charlie Dale with me. Dale...

296
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,144
you go organize them guys that's up there.

297
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,235
Movin' out in five minutes.

298
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,029
Let's go.

299
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:43,912
Sico, what's wrong with you?

300
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:46,206
I'm sick to my stomach.

301
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,750
Sico, you get up right now,
or I'll kick you so hard in the stomach...

302
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:51,169
- you're gonna be sick.
- I can't, Sergeant. I would if I could.

303
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,463
I'm... I'm sick.

304
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:56,842
- I'm sick.
- You ain't sick. Get up!

305
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:05,100
- What's the matter, Sico?
- I don't know, Sergeant.

306
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,729
It's my stomach.
I'm in pain. I got cramps.

307
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:12,983
I can't even sit up straight. I'm sick.

308
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:16,945
- Come on. Get up.
- Leave him.

309
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:21,116
I need a volunteer to carry the B.A.R. Drop your gear, Sico.
I'm taking you to the medics.

310
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,536
Thank you, Sergeant.

311
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,789
Don't argue with me.

312
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,791
Good luck, Keck.

313
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,649
Plug that hole on your right.

314
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,151
Move!

315
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,173
- Maybe they pulled out.
- Mm-mmm.

316
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:14,516
Hit dirt! Hit dirt!

317
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,356
Calm down. Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

318
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,488
Stretcher bearers!

319
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:39,332
Move it out! Move out!

320
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,839
Come on!

321
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:49,050
- Stretcher bearers, this way!
- Come on!

322
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,427
Go get that man!

323
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,554
We already got eight or nine down there.
We're not supposed to...

324
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,556
Don't argue with me!
I'm Captain Staros. Go get that man.

325
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,391
Jim, he's not the one
we should be thinking about.

326
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,894
Goddamn it, all of you!
Am I in command here or am I not?

327
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,896
Am I the captain or a goddamn private?

328
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:04,816
We got others that are hit bad, sir.
That was all I meant.

329
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:08,069
- I gave you an order, Private!
- Yes, sir!

330
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,490
Hello, First Sergeant.

331
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,661
Who we going after over here?

332
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:19,539
We think it's Jacques.

333
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:21,625
Jockey?

334
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:24,085
Well, shoot.
That's... That's... That's too bad.

335
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:28,757
Sir? Sir.

336
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:32,427
Sir, can I come back to the company
after we get Jockey back to the battalion?

337
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:36,097
- Okay. But you gotta get permission.
- Sure.

338
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:37,349
- All right.
- And my rifle.

339
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:43,772
Get up, Nicky!
You're still alive!

340
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:45,607
Keep moving! Keep moving!

341
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:49,861
Magnificent, Staros! Magnificent!

342
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,947
The finest thing these old eyes
have seen in a long time!

343
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:57,285
Beautifully conceived! Beautifully executed!
You'll be mentioned in battalion orders.

344
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,954
Young Whyte led beautifully.

345
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:03,792
- Yes, sir. Over.
- But sending in your second too was brilliant.

346
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,961
Just brilliant! They might well
have carried the ridge with luck.

347
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:10,590
I don't think they were hurt too bad.
Blane led well too.

348
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:15,637
Now, how many emplacements did they locate?
Did they knock any out?

349
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:19,808
We oughta have those ridges
cleaned out by noon! Over.

350
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,229
Hello? Hello?
Staros, are you there?

351
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:26,690
Here, sir. Over.

352
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:31,528
I said, how many emplacements did they locate?
Did they knock any out? Over.

353
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,989
Children.

354
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:36,908
I don't know, sir.

355
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:39,244
What the hell do you mean, you don't know?

356
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:41,955
How can you not know? Over!

357
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,666
I'm right here behind the first swell, sir.

358
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,336
I'm right here behind the swell.
You want me to stand up and wave? Over.

359
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:51,673
No, I can see where you are.
I want you to do something.

360
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:54,968
I want you to get up there
and see what the situation is.

361
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,262
I want Hill 210 in my hands tonight.

362
00:50:57,346 --> 00:51:00,181
Now, goddamn it,
the admiral got up at dawn for this!

363
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:03,184
Come to life down there, Staros! Out!

364
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,546
Move up!

365
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:52,650
Hey, Keck!

366
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:54,861
Yeah.

367
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,822
- We gotta get out of here.
- I know it.

368
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,742
Blane's dead.

369
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,744
You're in charge.

370
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:09,751
We know you there, Yank.

371
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,920
Tojo eats shit!

372
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:15,298
No! Roosevelt eats shit!

373
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,794
I got him! I got him!

374
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:12,772
I killed a man.

375
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:15,650
Hey, Queen!

376
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,652
Queen, you there?

377
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,821
Worst thing you can do.

378
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,823
Worse than rape.

379
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:25,118
Queen! You see them Japs
leaving that left ridge?

380
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,746
- I killed a man. Nobody can touch me for it.
- No, I ain't seen much of nothing.

381
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:31,666
Well, get your fuckin' head up
and look around!

382
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,503
I'm serious!

383
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:38,756
I counted seven Japs
leaving that left-hand grassy ridge!

384
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,093
I got me one of 'em!

385
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:45,513
- So?
- I think maybe they're pulling out!

386
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,311
Maybe somebody oughta
go tell the captain!

387
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:54,022
Well, you wanna be the one to do it?

388
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:01,654
You just stay put!
I'm ordering you!

389
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,096
Stay down!

390
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,814
Stay low.

391
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:07,303
Go! Go! Go, go!

392
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,014
What do we do now?

393
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:54,892
We wait right here. Maybe they'll
send us up some reinforcements.

394
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:56,436
To do what?

395
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,522
To capture some of these goddamn fucking
positions around here! What do you think?

396
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:03,026
- You mean you really want to go on with this?
- I don't know.

397
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,486
No. No. Not no uphill charge, but...

398
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:08,531
if they send us up some reinforcements,
maybe we could...

399
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,701
scout around
and locate these machine guns.

400
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,703
Anyway, it's better than
going back down through that.

401
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:17,081
- You wanna go back down?
- Something's coming. They're coming.

402
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,590
What are they doin'?
If they wanna throw us out of here...

403
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:28,009
why... why didn't they come in force?

404
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,887
Maybe they was acting on their own.

405
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,765
Maybe they wanted to get into nirvana.

406
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:36,726
They're coming.

407
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,904
Keck!

408
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:51,699
- Jesus.
- Oh, Jesus!

409
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:55,036
I blew my butt off!

410
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,330
- It's all right. It's all right.
- I blew my butt off!

411
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,874
Lay down!

412
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:03,753
- What a fucking recruit trick to pull!
- Take it easy. Take it easy.

413
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,798
I grabbed it by the pin!

414
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:10,968
You write my old lady. You tell her...
I want her to know I died like a man.

415
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:13,346
Nobody's gonna have to write your old lady.
You're gonna make it.

416
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,348
- Don't you bullshit me!
- Stay down!

417
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:18,518
Hey, hey.

418
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:21,729
I got mud on my face.
Wipe it off.

419
00:57:21,814 --> 00:57:25,191
Get it off. No!

420
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,027
I'll write her. I promise.

421
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,701
Take my canteen.
There's still some water in there.

422
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:43,501
Maybe it's for the best.

423
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:46,921
I'm all messed up down there.
I can't...

424
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,715
I can't fuck no more.

425
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,678
Wha...

426
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:55,847
Where am I?

427
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:57,890
Where am I?

428
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:03,187
You're gonna be all right.

429
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:05,314
Even if you die.

430
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,817
You didn't let your brother down.

431
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:12,029
Hey, if you hadn't thrown yourself against
that embankment, we'd have all been killed.

432
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:14,031
I'm gettin' cold.

433
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,578
I'm cold.

434
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:22,623
I'm freezing.

435
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,430
You gonna write his wife?

436
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,226
Fuck, no.

437
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,853
I don't know his old lady.

438
00:59:25,938 --> 00:59:28,564
That's the company commander's job.
That ain't mine. You out of your mind?

439
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:31,776
- I ain't... I ain't no good at writing no letters.
- You told him you would.

440
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:35,988
I'll say anything to 'em
when they're like that.

441
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:42,036
- Somebody ought to do it.
- Well, then you write her. You write her.

442
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,839
What's wrong, Jim?

443
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:16,339
- Aaah!
- There's nothing anybody can do for him.

444
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:19,258
He'll be dead before they can
ever get him back to a surgeon.

445
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:22,178
- Then I can't ask you to go out there.
- Well, maybe it's worth a try.

446
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:24,055
At least I could get
a syrette of morphine into him.

447
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:25,681
Would it keep him quiet?

448
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:27,266
Not for long.
But I could give him two.

449
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:29,852
And I could maybe leave him
three or four for himself.

450
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:35,191
Couldn't you give 'em to him all at once?

451
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:55,586
That's what you are.

452
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,091
That's all there is for us.
That's us. That's us.

453
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:05,805
I lost all 12. I lost all 12.

454
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:09,183
All 12 of 'em.
It's insanity up there.

455
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:12,895
I told 'em what to do. I showed 'em
where to go, and I gave 'em a push.

456
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,563
Come on! Somebody help!

457
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:17,691
I know you. I know you. I know you.

458
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:20,069
- Sergeant, it's insane.
- I don't know who's in charge.

459
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,655
- I don't know who's in charge! But don't let him go!
- All right.

460
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,366
- Don't let him go! I'm outta here. I'm outta here.
- Take him back.

461
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,535
- Let me hold your rifle.
- I'm outta of here. All right. Move, feet, move.

462
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:30,788
Move, move, move.
Move! Move! I'm moving.

463
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,874
I'm moving. I'm moving now.
Please, don't touch.

464
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:37,378
Don't touch. Don't look at me.
Don't touch. Okay, I'm outta here.

465
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,463
Come on. My feet are all right.

466
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:41,715
All right.

467
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:04,071
Somebody help me! Help me!

468
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:07,366
How goes it, kid? You gotta be quiet!

469
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,910
I came to help you, Tella.
Okay, calm down.

470
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:14,707
Fuck you! I'm dying!
I'm dying, Sarge!

471
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,042
Okay. Well, goddamn it,
do it with less noise!

472
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:20,880
- Are you gonna get me out of here?
- I'm gonna take you back.

473
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:24,258
Come on. Come on.

474
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,427
Come on.

475
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:30,306
Put me down! Put me down!

476
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:37,271
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.

477
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,482
Please, leave me alone.

478
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,950
Give me more. Give me more.

479
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:51,785
Give me more.

480
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:55,080
Give me more. Give me more.
Give me more.

481
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:57,249
- Okay.
- Give me more.

482
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,502
- Give me more.
- Here, Tella.

483
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:11,555
Good-bye. Good-bye.

484
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,893
Bye, kid.

485
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,896
Bye, Sarge. Good-bye.

486
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:39,124
Well, f-fortunately, Jim, the fate
of the company doesn't depend on one man.

487
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:47,007
Sergeant, I saw the whole thing
through the glasses.

488
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:49,510
I want you to know I'm gonna
mention you in orders tomorrow.

489
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:51,929
I'm gonna recommend you
for the Silver Star.

490
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,514
- That's the most courageous thing...
- Captain.

491
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:57,268
Captain, if you say one more word to thank
me, I'm gonna knock you right in the teeth.

492
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:02,398
You mention me in your fuckin' orders,
and I'll resign my rating so fast...

493
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:06,360
and leave you here to run
this busted-up outfit by yourself.

494
01:05:07,696 --> 01:05:10,489
You understand?

495
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:14,243
Property!
Whole fuckin' thing's about property.

496
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:33,596
What the hell's the matter with you, Staros?
Those men should be reinforced immediately!

497
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,265
What the hell are they doing?
I can see 'em through my glasses!

498
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,392
They're just lying there behind that ledge!

499
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:42,438
They should be up and out,
cleaning out those machine guns! Over.

500
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:45,065
I don't think you understand
what's going on down here, sir.

501
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:48,110
We've had heavy casualties.

502
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:49,987
We had a man...

503
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:52,990
His gut got shot out on the slopes, sir.
It created quite an upset.

504
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:56,285
Fine, fine.
Now, what about those reinforcements? Over.

505
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:59,913
I have two squads to...

506
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:02,333
First platoon I can send up, sir. Over.

507
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,668
What the hell do you mean,
two squads?

508
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:09,590
Goddamn you, Staros! When I say
reinforcements, goddamn it, I mean it!

509
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:13,052
You commit everybody you have there
and do it right now! Everybody!

510
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:17,181
Your first platoon too. I see 'em lying down
there on their fat asses doing nothing.

511
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:20,142
You get a man to 'em right now
with orders to attack!

512
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,353
And you move 'em
by the flank to the ridge!

513
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:25,272
Then you get that second platoon...
you move 'em over to the hill!

514
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:28,692
Have 'em press the center.
Go straight up that goddamn hill!

515
01:06:28,777 --> 01:06:30,277
You attack them right now!

516
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:34,114
Jesus Christ, Staros! Do I have to give you
a 10-cent lesson on infantry tactics...

517
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,950
while your men are
getting their asses shot off?

518
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:40,704
Colonel, I don't think that you fully
understand what is going on down here.

519
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:43,999
My company alone
cannot take that position, sir.

520
01:06:44,084 --> 01:06:47,670
The Japs are too well dug in.
They've got too much firepower.

521
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:49,797
Colonel, there's a...
there's a bunker up there.

522
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:53,175
We can't see it, and it's -
it's chewing my men to pieces, sir.

523
01:06:56,388 --> 01:06:59,973
I formally request to be given permission
for patrol reconnaissance around...

524
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:02,101
to the right of Hill 210
through the jungle.

525
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:06,355
I believe the entire position, sir, can be
outflanked with a maneuver there in force.

526
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:07,606
- No!
- It might save lives.

527
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:10,693
Goddamn it, I tell you no!
There will be no flanking move!

528
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,277
- Now listen to me, Staros.
- Damn!

529
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:15,155
You're not gonna take your men
around into the jungle...

530
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,157
to avoid a goddamn fight!

531
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:19,618
Now do you hear me, Staros?
I want you to attack.

532
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:22,871
I want you to attack right now
with every man at your disposal.

533
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:25,749
Now attack, Staros!
That's a direct order!

534
01:07:32,924 --> 01:07:34,591
Come on!

535
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:38,095
Sir, I must tell you
that I refuse to obey your order.

536
01:07:57,365 --> 01:08:00,117
This is not your fault, Jim.
He's ordering you to.

537
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:08,375
I again request permission for patrol
reconnaissance around to the right in force.

538
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:11,920
The time, sir...

539
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,465
is 1321 hours, 25 seconds.

540
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:17,050
I've got two witnesses here
listening to what I've said.

541
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:20,220
I request that you do the same
with witnesses there. Over.

542
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:28,061
Staros, don't you pull this
guardhouse lawyer bullshit with me!

543
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,314
Now, I know you're a goddamn lawyer!

544
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:34,359
This is not a court of law!
This is a war! It's a goddamn battle!

545
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:37,196
Now, I want that frontal attack!

546
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,323
I repeat my order! Over!

547
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,118
Colonel, I refuse to take my men
up there in a frontal attack.

548
01:08:43,203 --> 01:08:45,370
It's suicide, sir.
I've lived with these men, sir...

549
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:49,625
for two-and-a-half years, and I will
not order them all to their deaths.

550
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:52,002
Over.

551
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:02,179
This is a very important decision
you're making, Staros.

552
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:08,560
But if you feel that strongly,
maybe you have a reason.

553
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:12,105
- So I'm coming down there.
- Take a look.

554
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,942
Now, I'm not rescinding
my order to you, son.

555
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:18,362
But if I find there are extenuating
circumstances when I get down there...

556
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,030
I'm gonna take that into account.

557
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:24,201
Now, in the meantime, goddamn it,
I want you to hold on until I get there!

558
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:28,247
And if possible, you get those men
on the ridge out and moving! Out.

559
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:46,515
One spot's as good as another, men.
There's no place to hide.

560
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:54,398
Just take it easy, son.
Take it easy.

561
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:56,441
Take it easy.

562
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:59,194
Where's... Where's Fife?

563
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:01,238
Fife? He's right here, son. Fife.

564
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:04,449
Hold my hand, Fife.

565
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,451
Hold my hand.

566
01:10:12,083 --> 01:10:14,126
I got it.

567
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,004
Oh.

568
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:20,632
I'm dying, Fife.

569
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:49,453
Oh, Captain.

570
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:40,337
Shut up in a tomb.

571
01:11:42,715 --> 01:11:44,883
Can't lift the lid.

572
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,805
Played a role I never conceived.

573
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:52,599
Get that blouse on, soldier!
It's not a goddamn bathing beach.

574
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:54,142
Yeah, right here.

575
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:57,062
Put it on right now.
What are you aiming at, son?

576
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,064
Let's go get those son of a bitches!

577
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:02,359
Move up!

578
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:14,746
What are you doing laying down there
where you can't see a damn thing?

579
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:23,672
Observing, sir. Just sent 1st
platoon forward to the ridge, sir.

580
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:27,467
- How many of 'em were hit this time?
- None, sir.

581
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:30,554
None? Not one?

582
01:12:30,638 --> 01:12:34,474
That doesn't sound much like the situation
you described to me over the sound power.

583
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:38,562
Well, it's not, sir. The situation's changed,
sir, just in the last five minutes, sir.

584
01:12:41,441 --> 01:12:44,818
Captain, you listen to me.

585
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:47,654
Now, we're going over there,
and we're taking everybody with us.

586
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:50,073
Now, do you have any more
formal complaints or demurrers?

587
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:53,660
- No, sir. Not now.
- All right, goddamn it!

588
01:12:53,745 --> 01:12:57,247
We're gonna do things my way! My way!
You understand that, Captain?

589
01:12:57,331 --> 01:13:01,418
We're taking everybody over to that ledge!
We may take that ridge by nightfall!

590
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:04,254
I think the ridge is quite a way
from being reduced, sir.

591
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:15,599
Show me how to see things
the way you do.

592
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:20,937
Show me how to see things
the way you do.

593
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:27,611
We're just dirt. We're just dirt.

594
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,178
We're gonna get killed if we stay here.

595
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:57,182
Bell, take six men...

596
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,184
and go see what's up there.

597
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:07,150
And we'll cover you
best we can from down here.

598
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:30,817
Okay. You guys... You guys stay here.

599
01:15:30,902 --> 01:15:32,402
Okay?

600
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:34,404
I'm goin' up alone.

601
01:17:14,005 --> 01:17:16,047
Come out.

602
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:23,763
Come out where I am.

603
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:38,338
There was a...
There's a bunker up there.

604
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:44,260
It's five guns. It's five guns.

605
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:52,185
That strongpoint up there...

606
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,854
somewhere up there around those rocks...

607
01:18:54,939 --> 01:18:56,856
is the key to this ridge.

608
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:02,195
Bell here is quite right.

609
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:05,240
From their knob up there,
those goddamn little brown brothers...

610
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:10,620
can cover the whole of the ground in front
of this position for a thousand yards.

611
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:14,040
They've left this ledge unguarded.
Now, goddamn it, that's a mistake.

612
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:16,292
That's a hell of a mistake.

613
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:19,921
We need to take advantage of it
before they see their error.

614
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:26,386
All right. All right,
I know you're all pretty exhausted.

615
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:29,722
And we've had a hell of a time
getting water up here.

616
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:33,726
For that I'm sorry.
I apologize to you all.

617
01:19:34,854 --> 01:19:39,399
But if we can reduce this bunker tomorrow,
I think we can take this ridge.

618
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:44,821
So I'm asking for volunteers.

619
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:47,198
Go back up there and knock it out.

620
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:49,200
Sir?

621
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:52,245
I'll be glad to... to go back up
and lead the way back for a party.

622
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:54,539
- All right, Bell.
- I'll go, Colonel, sir.

623
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,750
And you. All right.

624
01:19:57,835 --> 01:20:00,587
I'd like to lead the party, Colonel.
I'd like that very much, sir.

625
01:20:00,671 --> 01:20:02,755
All right, John.
I was hoping you'd say that.

626
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,883
- Go ahead. You'll be in command.
- All right. I'll go, sir.

627
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:06,092
- All right, you.
- Sir.

628
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:07,177
You.

629
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:11,222
All right, men. That's enough.
Seven is plenty. Gather up.

630
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:19,606
I don't know if you realize
the importance of this operation, Staros.

631
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:24,110
Once our position is secured,
we can move the bombers in.

632
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:28,198
That means air power
for a thousand miles in every direction.

633
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:32,327
Guadalcanal may be
the turning point in the war.

634
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:35,997
It'll cost lives, Staros.

635
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:38,500
- Is that what's troubling you?
- No, sir.

636
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:43,588
Now, I explained to you
the importance of this objective.

637
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:46,883
How many men do you think it's worth?
How many lives?

638
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:48,885
I can't say, sir.

639
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:59,062
Are you prepared to sacrifice the lives
of any of your men in this campaign?

640
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:03,483
How many?

641
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,985
One? Two?

642
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:07,987
Twenty?

643
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:12,033
Lives will be lost in
your company, Captain.

644
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:18,915
And if you don't have the stomach for it,
now is the time to let me know.

645
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:20,959
No, sir. You're right.

646
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:22,961
About everything you said.

647
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:26,297
Fine. Fine.
That's all, Captain.

648
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:31,094
One more thing, Staros.

649
01:21:32,096 --> 01:21:36,599
It's not necessary for you to ever tell me
that you think I'm right.

650
01:21:36,684 --> 01:21:38,351
Ever.

651
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:40,687
We'll assume it.

652
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:42,480
Dismissed.

653
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:01,457
I feel sorry for you, kid.

654
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:04,794
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a little.

655
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:10,925
This army's gonna kill you.

656
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:18,016
If you were smart, you'd take care of yourself.
There's nothing you can do for anybody else.

657
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:24,897
Just running into a burning house
where nobody can be saved.

658
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:41,331
What difference you think you can make?
One single man in all this madness.

659
01:22:47,338 --> 01:22:49,714
If you die, it's gonna be for nothin'.

660
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:57,680
There's not some other world out there
where everything's gonna be okay.

661
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:00,850
There's just this one.

662
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,937
Just this rock.

663
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,769
Go ahead. Come on.

664
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:47,772
Who's deciding who's gonna live?

665
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:50,566
Who's deciding who's gonna die?

666
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:54,404
This is futile!

667
01:23:55,823 --> 01:24:01,035
Look at me.
I stand right up here and not one bullet!

668
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,121
Not one shot!

669
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:06,165
Why?

670
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,251
How come they all had to die?

671
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:12,755
I can stand right here. I can stand
right up, and nothing happens to me!

672
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:34,819
We.

673
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:43,870
We together.

674
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:56,132
One being.

675
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:13,733
Flow together like water...

676
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,989
till I can't tell you from me.

677
01:25:37,508 --> 01:25:40,176
I drink you.

678
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,679
Now.

679
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:47,809
Now.

680
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:26,931
You're my light.

681
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:31,686
My guide.

682
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:42,840
John, we'll be right behind you.

683
01:27:42,925 --> 01:27:46,802
If you can break through, we'll come pouring after.
We'll charge at your whistle signal.

684
01:27:48,138 --> 01:27:50,890
All right, let's go, men.
Go get 'em.

685
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,794
Shit. Shit. Shit.

686
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:45,546
Okay.

687
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:50,718
Stay down, below this ledge...

688
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:54,805
and I'll call down the data
from above.

689
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:59,477
Once the 81 s have plastered that rock
as much as possible...

690
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:03,314
we're gonna crawl along
the big rock for cover...

691
01:30:04,775 --> 01:30:06,942
and then flank them to the right.

692
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:08,694
Okay?

693
01:30:10,197 --> 01:30:12,865
Okay. Okay.

694
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:35,638
Azimuth 1-4-7-0...

695
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:39,058
from Easy Roger Seven.

696
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:41,477
100 left. Add 200.

697
01:30:41,561 --> 01:30:44,230
Uncle Baker One, fire mission.

698
01:30:44,314 --> 01:30:47,316
Azimuth 1-4-7-0
from Easy Roger Seven.

699
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:51,403
Left 100. Add 200.

700
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:54,573
Machine gun. Will adjust. Over.

701
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:57,368
Understand.
1-4-7-0 from Easy Roger Seven.

702
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:13,801
Left 25, drop 50.

703
01:31:15,137 --> 01:31:17,221
Left 25, Uncle Baker One.

704
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:19,557
Left 25, drop 50.

705
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:21,559
Fire for effect. Over.

706
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:24,395
Roger, Uncle Baker One. 1-4-7...

707
01:31:46,376 --> 01:31:48,043
Let's go!

708
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:06,812
Okay, we're gonna continue on
up the hill to the right.

709
01:32:06,897 --> 01:32:10,482
Nobody fire or throw their grenades
till I give the signal.

710
01:32:10,567 --> 01:32:12,484
Okay, let's do it.

711
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:28,751
Is he okay?

712
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:31,837
- Is he all right?
- What do you want to do now, sir?

713
01:32:31,922 --> 01:32:34,840
- We can't take him with us.
- No, we can't leave him here!

714
01:32:34,925 --> 01:32:37,593
Shut up. He's from your platoon.
You stay with him.

715
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:41,722
We can leave him and pick him up
on the way back if he's still alive.

716
01:32:45,685 --> 01:32:48,020
- Is he dead?
- Not yet.

717
01:32:48,104 --> 01:32:50,731
Dale, stay with him!
Cover our flank! Move!

718
01:33:33,817 --> 01:33:36,068
We're pinned down!

719
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:07,016
Fall back!

720
01:34:12,522 --> 01:34:14,565
Go!

721
01:35:03,490 --> 01:35:05,824
Move back!

722
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:18,420
Look out!

723
01:35:24,386 --> 01:35:26,136
Watch out!

724
01:36:05,135 --> 01:36:06,677
Clear!

725
01:36:07,554 --> 01:36:09,304
Clear!

726
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,830
Come on! Get down!

727
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:02,274
Come on. Get out of there.

728
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:04,026
Come on.

729
01:37:06,696 --> 01:37:08,864
Want to kill soldiers?

730
01:37:16,623 --> 01:37:19,333
You piece of shit?

731
01:37:23,213 --> 01:37:26,465
Son of a bitch!

732
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:28,550
Son of a bitch!

733
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:49,112
You all right?

734
01:37:52,867 --> 01:37:54,535
I shot a man.

735
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:35,033
Stinks around here.
All these dead people.

736
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:37,119
Put a cigarette up your nose.

737
01:39:56,449 --> 01:39:58,909
Fire in the hole!

738
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:01,953
Look at 'em move!

739
01:40:02,038 --> 01:40:03,789
Look at 'em move!

740
01:40:03,873 --> 01:40:06,792
We got 'em on the run!
Way to go, John!

741
01:40:06,876 --> 01:40:11,254
When they saw you make that attack and win, it was
like you'd put their hearts right back in 'em.

742
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:13,674
- Hey! Hey!
- Don't do that, soldier!

743
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:16,426
Take good care of the others, men.
G-2 will want them.

744
01:40:16,511 --> 01:40:18,470
There'll be somebody around
before long.

745
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:21,139
I think we've wasted enough time here.
Let's go!

746
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:24,142
Sir, I've got a few recommendations
for decorations I'd like to turn in to you.

747
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:27,562
Yes, yes, John. We're gonna get everything
for all of 'em that we can, but later.

748
01:40:27,647 --> 01:40:32,025
In the meantime, I want you to know that I'm
personally recommending you for something, John.

749
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:34,695
- Perhaps the big one.
- Thank you, sir, but I don't feel I deserve it.

750
01:40:34,779 --> 01:40:36,905
Oh, yes, you do, John.
Yes, you do.

751
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:39,783
Getting it for you, now,
that's gonna be the goddamn problem.

752
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:44,287
But, hell, it would just be a big thing for the
battalion and the regiment too if you did get it.

753
01:40:44,372 --> 01:40:46,123
Now, we better
get moving out of here.

754
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:50,669
We need to extend our lines, hook up with
the other companies and push on to the top.

755
01:40:50,753 --> 01:40:53,839
Would you like to take command
of Baker Company over on the left?

756
01:40:53,923 --> 01:40:55,340
Of course.

757
01:40:55,425 --> 01:40:58,343
Sir, I don't mean to be a wet blanket or
anything like that, but about the water...

758
01:40:58,428 --> 01:41:01,430
- If we don't get some water to these...
- Don't worry about water.

759
01:41:03,224 --> 01:41:07,060
John, I don't want anything to break up this
attack of ours, now that we have the momentum.

760
01:41:08,438 --> 01:41:12,065
We'll have some water
in a couple of hours.

761
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:14,693
I've arranged for that.

762
01:41:14,777 --> 01:41:18,196
Now, we just can't stop now,
goddamn it, and wait for it.

763
01:41:18,281 --> 01:41:20,198
No, sir.

764
01:41:20,283 --> 01:41:22,534
That's right.

765
01:41:22,618 --> 01:41:26,037
And if some of the men... pass out...

766
01:41:26,122 --> 01:41:28,498
why, hell, they'll just have to pass out.

767
01:41:32,378 --> 01:41:34,212
All right.

768
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:37,007
They could...
You know they could die from it.

769
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:40,343
Well, they could die
from enemy fire too!

770
01:41:40,428 --> 01:41:43,346
They're all tough boys.

771
01:41:47,477 --> 01:41:49,686
Come on, men, let's go!

772
01:41:49,771 --> 01:41:52,522
You'll see plenty more of those
where we're going!

773
01:41:52,607 --> 01:41:55,317
Are we going up this hill
or aren't we?

774
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:02,991
John, I'm convinced that the Japanese
position can be broken right now.

775
01:42:03,075 --> 01:42:05,911
All we have to do is keep going
and we'll have this hill.

776
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:08,246
We'll have this hill by sundown.

777
01:42:08,331 --> 01:42:11,416
You see the spirit in these men?
Do you see the new spirit?

778
01:42:11,501 --> 01:42:16,546
Well, I want to take advantage of that before
something happens to sap their strength.

779
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:20,759
To have this battalion relieved
in... in a defeat...

780
01:42:20,843 --> 01:42:23,929
or even to have it reinforced from troops
from the reserve regiment...

781
01:42:24,013 --> 01:42:26,640
If we were to stall
before reaching the top, well...

782
01:42:26,724 --> 01:42:30,894
Jesus Christ, that's just
a hell of a lot more than I could stand!

783
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:33,438
I've waited all my life for this.

784
01:42:33,523 --> 01:42:37,859
I've worked, slaved, eaten, oh, untold
buckets of shit to have this opportunity...

785
01:42:37,944 --> 01:42:40,654
and I don't intend to give it up now.

786
01:42:43,825 --> 01:42:47,911
You don't know what it feels like
to be passed over.

787
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:49,287
I mean, you're young.

788
01:42:49,372 --> 01:42:52,999
You're just out of the academy.
You know, you... you've got your war.

789
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:56,503
Fifteen years, this...
this is my first war!

790
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:05,428
John, someday you'll understand.

791
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:13,812
You're like a son to me, John.

792
01:43:15,565 --> 01:43:18,483
You know what my son does?

793
01:43:18,568 --> 01:43:20,735
He's a bait salesman.

794
01:43:23,865 --> 01:43:25,782
You've done a hell of a job, John.

795
01:43:25,867 --> 01:43:30,161
I'm gonna make sure that you get
everything... everything that you deserve.

796
01:43:32,373 --> 01:43:34,040
Thank you, sir.

797
01:43:36,752 --> 01:43:38,253
God...

798
01:43:39,255 --> 01:43:44,092
Goddamn it! I want three runners!
Get me three runners!

799
01:43:44,176 --> 01:43:46,469
You go back to the rear
as far as you have to go to find water...

800
01:43:46,554 --> 01:43:48,597
and get back here with it
as fast as you can!

801
01:43:48,681 --> 01:43:51,516
We attack in one hour!

802
01:43:51,601 --> 01:43:53,518
We'll throw everything
we got at 'em!

803
01:43:53,603 --> 01:43:56,187
We're going all the way!
Nothing's stopping us!

804
01:43:56,272 --> 01:43:58,273
It's high ground by nightfall!

805
01:44:22,465 --> 01:44:24,758
You seen many dead people?

806
01:44:25,801 --> 01:44:27,761
Plenty.

807
01:44:27,845 --> 01:44:31,097
They're no different than dead dogs...

808
01:44:31,182 --> 01:44:33,683
once you get used to the idea.

809
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:40,023
They're meat, kid.

810
01:44:56,165 --> 01:44:58,249
Are you righteous?

811
01:44:58,334 --> 01:45:00,335
Kind?

812
01:45:02,338 --> 01:45:05,340
Does your confidence lie in this?

813
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:10,011
Are you loved by all?

814
01:45:12,056 --> 01:45:14,057
Know that I was too.

815
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:21,898
Do you imagine your sufferings
will be less because you loved goodness?

816
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:24,693
Truth?

817
01:48:43,893 --> 01:48:46,519
This way!

818
01:49:04,747 --> 01:49:07,874
Get down!
Get on the fucking ground!

819
01:49:07,958 --> 01:49:10,418
Get fucking down now!

820
01:49:23,641 --> 01:49:27,101
Get down! Get down!

821
01:49:27,186 --> 01:49:29,354
Get down! Stay there!

822
01:49:38,155 --> 01:49:41,950
Get back!
Get on the fucking ground!

823
01:49:42,034 --> 01:49:43,701
Now!

824
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:45,680
This great evil.

825
01:50:47,891 --> 01:50:50,893
Where does it come from?

826
01:50:55,190 --> 01:50:58,192
How did it steal into the world?

827
01:51:09,038 --> 01:51:13,333
What seed,
what root did it grow from?

828
01:51:17,421 --> 01:51:19,630
Who's doing this?

829
01:51:22,343 --> 01:51:24,344
Who's killing us...

830
01:51:28,223 --> 01:51:31,017
robbing us of life and light...

831
01:51:35,564 --> 01:51:39,150
mocking us with the sight
of what we might have known?

832
01:52:04,927 --> 01:52:07,845
Does our ruin benefit the earth?

833
01:52:10,099 --> 01:52:14,102
Does it help the grass to grow,
the sun to shine?

834
01:52:18,857 --> 01:52:22,735
Is this darkness in you too?

835
01:52:28,617 --> 01:52:31,160
Have you passed
through this night?

836
01:52:36,959 --> 01:52:40,128
I'm gonna sink my teeth
into your liver.

837
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:45,174
You're dying.

838
01:52:57,396 --> 01:52:59,814
See them birds up there?

839
01:53:00,816 --> 01:53:03,151
They're gonna eat you raw.

840
01:53:08,282 --> 01:53:11,284
Where you're going,
you're not coming back from.

841
01:54:23,106 --> 01:54:25,691
What are you to me?

842
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:32,865
Nothin'.

843
01:56:54,299 --> 01:56:55,966
Have a seat here.

844
01:57:06,645 --> 01:57:09,814
Staros, I'm relieving you
of your command.

845
01:57:13,026 --> 01:57:15,236
Lieutenant Band
will take over for you.

846
01:57:16,947 --> 01:57:19,073
I already told him.

847
01:57:28,834 --> 01:57:32,336
It's a hard thing to do.

848
01:57:32,421 --> 01:57:35,256
Difficult decision to make.

849
01:57:37,759 --> 01:57:39,885
I don't think you're tough enough.

850
01:57:41,346 --> 01:57:43,597
You're too soft.
You're just too soft-hearted.

851
01:57:43,682 --> 01:57:46,392
You're not tough-fibered enough.

852
01:57:51,022 --> 01:57:55,025
Anyway, it's... it's my decision to make,
and I've already made it.

853
01:57:56,611 --> 01:57:59,613
I don't like to see my men
get killed, sir.

854
01:58:06,163 --> 01:58:09,373
Have you ever had anyone
die in your arms, sir?

855
01:58:09,458 --> 01:58:11,959
Have you?

856
01:58:24,473 --> 01:58:27,224
I don't see any reason
to make a scandal out of this.

857
01:58:27,309 --> 01:58:29,894
I don't want it in the records
of the battalion where I commanded...

858
01:58:29,978 --> 01:58:32,897
and there's no reason for you
to have it on your records.

859
01:58:32,981 --> 01:58:36,609
This has nothing to do
with cowardice or inefficiency.

860
01:58:39,988 --> 01:58:42,364
Look at this jungle.

861
01:58:42,449 --> 01:58:47,578
Look at those vines, the way they twine
around the trees, swallowing everything.

862
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:52,416
Nature's cruel, Staros.

863
01:59:01,593 --> 01:59:03,844
I'm going to let you apply
for reassignment...

864
01:59:03,929 --> 01:59:08,808
to the Judge Advocate General's Corps
in Washington for reasons of ill health.

865
01:59:08,892 --> 01:59:10,684
You're a lawyer.

866
01:59:10,769 --> 01:59:12,436
You had malaria yet?

867
01:59:12,521 --> 01:59:14,605
- No, I haven't.
- Doesn't matter.

868
01:59:14,689 --> 01:59:18,442
I can fix that.
Anyway, you probably will have it.

869
01:59:18,527 --> 01:59:21,445
I'm also recommending you
for the Silver Star...

870
01:59:21,530 --> 01:59:25,199
and I'll recommend it in such a way
it definitely won't be refused.

871
01:59:26,743 --> 01:59:29,745
Might as well have
the Purple Heart too.

872
01:59:32,249 --> 01:59:33,791
Why?

873
01:59:33,875 --> 01:59:36,460
Because of that scratch on your face...

874
01:59:36,545 --> 01:59:39,672
and because of
those cuts on your hands.

875
01:59:39,756 --> 01:59:41,674
Now, you listen to me, Staros.

876
01:59:41,758 --> 01:59:45,344
I think it's best you go back right away with
the next batch of wounded and prisoners.

877
01:59:45,428 --> 01:59:49,265
It is no goddamn good for you
to keep hanging around.

878
01:59:49,349 --> 01:59:52,726
The quieter we keep this,
the better it'll be for all.

879
02:00:27,554 --> 02:00:30,681
This is from Colonel Tall.

880
02:00:30,765 --> 02:00:35,811
"Our victory gives us
the highest reasons for pride."

881
02:00:35,896 --> 02:00:39,440
"It will prove a milestone
in the battle for Guadalcanal."

882
02:00:40,859 --> 02:00:46,530
"Tomorrow, the division commander will arrive
to make a personal inspection of the line."

883
02:00:46,615 --> 02:00:51,118
"After the inspection, we're to be relieved by a
battalion of the division's reserve regiment."

884
02:00:52,662 --> 02:00:56,707
"I've secured for the battalion
a week's rest off the line."

885
02:01:01,004 --> 02:01:02,546
That's all.

886
02:02:58,329 --> 02:03:00,039
Hours like months.

887
02:03:02,751 --> 02:03:04,793
Days like years.

888
02:03:07,338 --> 02:03:10,591
Walked into the golden age...

889
02:03:14,262 --> 02:03:17,514
stood on the shores
of a new world.

890
02:03:27,525 --> 02:03:30,778
I would've come by
and paid you guys a visit...

891
02:03:30,862 --> 02:03:32,529
but...

892
02:03:35,533 --> 02:03:38,535
I just felt like being alone, you know.

893
02:03:39,871 --> 02:03:41,538
Yeah?

894
02:03:51,508 --> 02:03:54,510
We... We wanted to thank you, sir...

895
02:03:58,306 --> 02:04:01,308
for asking to make
that flanking move...

896
02:04:03,103 --> 02:04:05,104
for watching out for us...

897
02:04:07,107 --> 02:04:09,108
keeping us together.

898
02:04:14,864 --> 02:04:18,367
We're all sorry to see you go.
We feel like you got a rotten deal.

899
02:04:20,912 --> 02:04:24,164
Well, I'm not sure that you're right.

900
02:04:26,668 --> 02:04:28,794
The tough part is...

901
02:04:30,588 --> 02:04:32,756
not knowing
if you're doing any good.

902
02:04:34,759 --> 02:04:36,760
That's the hard part.

903
02:04:38,763 --> 02:04:42,307
But it doesn't matter.
I don't care. I'm...

904
02:04:42,392 --> 02:04:44,393
I'm glad to be going.

905
02:04:45,728 --> 02:04:47,646
I'm glad.

906
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:50,149
There's still time.
We could file a complaint.

907
02:04:50,233 --> 02:04:53,777
For what?
What good would that do?

908
02:04:56,531 --> 02:04:58,240
Anyway, I want to go.

909
02:05:01,119 --> 02:05:03,620
Leave it alone. Let it lay.

910
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:18,051
What does that mean, sir?

911
02:05:20,889 --> 02:05:23,557
It means,
"You've been like my sons."

912
02:05:34,569 --> 02:05:36,570
You are my sons.

913
02:05:37,947 --> 02:05:39,948
My dear sons.

914
02:05:41,075 --> 02:05:43,160
Push up.

915
02:05:43,244 --> 02:05:45,954
You live inside me now.

916
02:05:49,792 --> 02:05:52,586
I'll carry you wherever I go.

917
02:06:07,977 --> 02:06:10,979
Can't nothing make you forget it.

918
02:06:14,442 --> 02:06:17,444
Each time you start from scratch.

919
02:06:22,784 --> 02:06:25,535
War don't ennoble men.

920
02:06:25,620 --> 02:06:27,746
It turns 'em into dogs.

921
02:06:34,629 --> 02:06:36,838
Poisons the soul.

922
02:07:40,987 --> 02:07:42,988
My dear wife.

923
02:07:45,616 --> 02:07:47,993
You get something
twisted out of your insides...

924
02:07:48,077 --> 02:07:52,247
by all this blood, filth and noise.

925
02:08:01,674 --> 02:08:04,259
I want to stay changeless for you.

926
02:08:06,888 --> 02:08:10,098
I want to come back to you
the man I was before.

927
02:08:17,565 --> 02:08:20,567
How do we get
to those other shores...

928
02:08:24,447 --> 02:08:26,573
to those blue hills?

929
02:08:36,667 --> 02:08:38,377
Love.

930
02:08:47,678 --> 02:08:50,347
Where does it come from?

931
02:08:58,147 --> 02:09:00,899
Who lit this flame in us?

932
02:09:07,407 --> 02:09:10,200
No war can put it out...

933
02:09:11,285 --> 02:09:13,578
conquer it.

934
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:22,921
I was a prisoner.

935
02:09:27,343 --> 02:09:29,636
You set me free.

936
02:09:33,891 --> 02:09:39,229
No matter how much training you got,
how careful you are...

937
02:09:41,023 --> 02:09:44,359
it's a matter of luck
whether or not you get killed.

938
02:09:44,444 --> 02:09:49,990
Makes no difference who you are
or how tough a guy you might be.

939
02:09:51,868 --> 02:09:56,246
If you're in the wrong spot at
the wrong time, you're gonna get it.

940
02:10:06,841 --> 02:10:09,426
I look at that boy dying...

941
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:12,971
I don't feel nothing.

942
02:10:16,017 --> 02:10:18,935
I don't care about nothing anymore.

943
02:10:23,691 --> 02:10:25,817
Sounds like bliss.

944
02:10:30,156 --> 02:10:33,492
I don't have that feeling yet...

945
02:10:33,576 --> 02:10:35,535
that numbness.

946
02:10:36,913 --> 02:10:39,581
Not like the rest of you guys.

947
02:10:43,169 --> 02:10:46,171
Maybe 'cause I knew what to expect.

948
02:10:48,716 --> 02:10:51,718
Maybe I was just frozen up already.

949
02:11:34,929 --> 02:11:37,931
I haven't touched another woman
since I was called up.

950
02:11:39,600 --> 02:11:41,434
Or talked to one.

951
02:11:45,439 --> 02:11:47,148
I don't want to...

952
02:11:48,442 --> 02:11:50,777
I don't want to feel the desire.

953
02:12:28,149 --> 02:12:31,234
All right. Abrahams!
Abrahams, here you go.

954
02:12:31,319 --> 02:12:35,030
Stack! Where's Stack?
Bring him out. Here.

955
02:12:35,114 --> 02:12:37,699
Bell?

956
02:12:37,783 --> 02:12:39,909
Bell!

957
02:12:39,994 --> 02:12:43,038
Another one for Bell.
Another one for Bell.

958
02:12:45,791 --> 02:12:47,792
Dear Jack...

959
02:12:49,587 --> 02:12:52,714
I've met an Air Force captain.

960
02:12:52,798 --> 02:12:55,300
I've fallen in love with him.

961
02:12:57,553 --> 02:13:00,180
I want a divorce to marry him.

962
02:13:06,145 --> 02:13:09,773
I know you can say no,
but I'm asking you anyway...

963
02:13:09,857 --> 02:13:13,360
out of the memory
of what we had together.

964
02:13:19,450 --> 02:13:22,327
Forgive me.

965
02:13:22,411 --> 02:13:25,747
It just got too lonely, Jack.

966
02:13:45,434 --> 02:13:47,435
We'll meet again someday.

967
02:13:51,190 --> 02:13:54,859
People who have been as close
as we've been always meet again.

968
02:14:03,703 --> 02:14:06,621
I have no right
to speak to you this way.

969
02:14:06,706 --> 02:14:09,332
I can't stop myself.

970
02:14:09,417 --> 02:14:11,584
A habit so strong.

971
02:14:13,754 --> 02:14:16,840
Oh, my friend
of all those shining years...

972
02:14:20,428 --> 02:14:22,512
help me leave you.

973
02:15:49,683 --> 02:15:51,684
What's your name?

974
02:17:03,924 --> 02:17:05,925
We were a family.

975
02:17:09,179 --> 02:17:11,890
How'd it break up and come apart...

976
02:17:15,060 --> 02:17:18,521
so that now
we're turned against each other...

977
02:17:20,274 --> 02:17:23,276
each standing in the other's light?

978
02:17:32,202 --> 02:17:35,705
How did we lose the good
that was given us...

979
02:17:36,665 --> 02:17:38,666
let it slip away...

980
02:17:41,545 --> 02:17:43,880
scatter it, careless?

981
02:18:04,193 --> 02:18:07,236
What's keeping us
from reaching out...

982
02:18:07,321 --> 02:18:09,322
touching the glory?

983
02:18:11,492 --> 02:18:15,286
I'd have had you, Witt,
if you was a Jap...

984
02:18:15,371 --> 02:18:17,372
long ago.

985
02:18:18,999 --> 02:18:21,000
They leave you here?

986
02:18:22,503 --> 02:18:24,087
Yep.

987
02:18:24,171 --> 02:18:26,714
I slowed 'em up.

988
02:18:26,799 --> 02:18:28,800
Don't mind, really.

989
02:18:29,885 --> 02:18:33,054
The medic,
he fixed me up pretty good.

990
02:18:33,138 --> 02:18:34,806
I got plenty of ammo.

991
02:18:37,518 --> 02:18:40,103
Somebody'll be along for me eventually.

992
02:18:44,942 --> 02:18:47,610
- They got you good.
- Right in the knee.

993
02:18:47,695 --> 02:18:49,320
Yeah.

994
02:18:49,405 --> 02:18:51,948
I'm out of this war for good, Witt.

995
02:18:57,287 --> 02:18:59,205
What are you doing down here?

996
02:18:59,289 --> 02:19:02,667
Just, you know...
I'm heading back to the company.

997
02:19:02,751 --> 02:19:05,086
Yeah.

998
02:19:06,380 --> 02:19:08,715
Well, you give all them boys my best.

999
02:19:08,799 --> 02:19:11,592
You can come with me if you want.

1000
02:19:11,677 --> 02:19:13,428
I'll help you along.

1001
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:17,640
Nah, it's nice and quiet...

1002
02:19:17,725 --> 02:19:19,726
peaceful up here.

1003
02:19:22,146 --> 02:19:25,481
I'd just slow you up.
There'll be somebody along.

1004
02:19:29,153 --> 02:19:31,571
I'll remind 'em.

1005
02:19:31,655 --> 02:19:33,322
Okay.

1006
02:21:08,961 --> 02:21:11,671
Hey, Witt.

1007
02:21:15,592 --> 02:21:18,511
Who you making trouble for today?

1008
02:21:18,595 --> 02:21:21,514
What do you mean?

1009
02:21:21,598 --> 02:21:24,851
Well, isn't that what you like to do?

1010
02:21:24,935 --> 02:21:27,687
Turn left when they say go right?

1011
02:21:34,444 --> 02:21:37,446
Why are you
such a troublemaker, Witt?

1012
02:21:39,283 --> 02:21:42,285
You care about me,
don't you, Sergeant?

1013
02:21:43,370 --> 02:21:45,621
I always felt like you did.

1014
02:21:46,957 --> 02:21:49,959
Why do you always
make yourself out like a rock?

1015
02:21:51,295 --> 02:21:53,629
One day I can come up
and talk to you.

1016
02:21:54,715 --> 02:21:57,133
By the next day...

1017
02:21:57,217 --> 02:21:59,468
it's like we never even met.

1018
02:22:12,524 --> 02:22:14,901
Lonely house now.

1019
02:22:17,613 --> 02:22:19,780
You ever get lonely?

1020
02:22:19,865 --> 02:22:22,742
Only around people.

1021
02:22:23,619 --> 02:22:25,411
Only around people.

1022
02:22:30,542 --> 02:22:33,794
You still believing
in the beautiful light, are you?

1023
02:22:41,511 --> 02:22:43,679
How do you do that?

1024
02:22:45,224 --> 02:22:47,558
You're a magician to me.

1025
02:22:56,401 --> 02:22:59,695
I still see a spark in you.

1026
02:23:23,762 --> 02:23:26,180
One man looks at a dying bird...

1027
02:23:26,265 --> 02:23:28,808
and thinks there's nothing
but unanswered pain.

1028
02:23:32,104 --> 02:23:34,981
But death's got the final word.

1029
02:23:36,608 --> 02:23:39,277
It's laughing at him.

1030
02:23:48,662 --> 02:23:51,956
Another man sees that same bird...

1031
02:23:54,084 --> 02:23:56,419
feels the glory...

1032
02:24:01,174 --> 02:24:04,176
feels something smiling through it.

1033
02:25:01,234 --> 02:25:03,486
We need to get out of here right now.

1034
02:25:03,570 --> 02:25:07,656
You explain to... to headquarters
the situation?

1035
02:25:07,741 --> 02:25:10,284
- No.
- Do they know where we are?

1036
02:25:10,369 --> 02:25:12,286
'Cause we're sitting ducks out here.

1037
02:25:13,622 --> 02:25:16,999
Well, I think that's up to me
to judge, Sergeant.

1038
02:25:18,335 --> 02:25:23,005
No, I think we just need to send somebody
up there and find out how close they are.

1039
02:25:23,090 --> 02:25:25,257
Okay? It's easy.

1040
02:25:26,343 --> 02:25:29,678
Hey, Weld
get headquarters on that thing.

1041
02:25:29,763 --> 02:25:31,680
The fire's coming closer, sir.

1042
02:25:31,765 --> 02:25:33,808
Line's cut.

1043
02:25:33,892 --> 02:25:35,810
This line?

1044
02:25:35,894 --> 02:25:40,022
Well, we need to send somebody out there
to find out where that line is being cut...

1045
02:25:40,107 --> 02:25:43,109
and we need to find out how
close they are.

1046
02:25:43,193 --> 02:25:44,735
Come on.

1047
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:48,072
Okay, okay.

1048
02:25:51,284 --> 02:25:53,411
Hey, you.

1049
02:25:53,495 --> 02:25:54,995
You go.

1050
02:25:56,748 --> 02:25:59,834
You're going, Fife.

1051
02:26:03,296 --> 02:26:06,132
Coombs. You go too.

1052
02:26:07,134 --> 02:26:09,552
- Come on.
- I'll go.

1053
02:26:09,636 --> 02:26:13,222
But I want you to know I think
the whole thing's a bad idea though.

1054
02:26:13,306 --> 02:26:15,558
If they come down here
in any strength, Lieutenant...

1055
02:26:15,642 --> 02:26:17,893
they're gonna knock our position
to hell and flinders.

1056
02:26:17,978 --> 02:26:20,563
Well, you don't have to go, Private.
There's others who'll volunteer.

1057
02:26:20,647 --> 02:26:25,568
No, I want to go, sir. In case
something bad happens, I want to be there.

1058
02:26:25,652 --> 02:26:28,404
All right.
Y-You stay by the river.

1059
02:26:28,488 --> 02:26:31,407
That jungle's too thick.
And be very careful.

1060
02:26:31,491 --> 02:26:33,117
I will.

1061
02:26:33,201 --> 02:26:34,869
Good luck, Witt.

1062
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:37,580
You okay, Fife?

1063
02:28:04,668 --> 02:28:07,002
A reinforced battalion.

1064
02:28:09,214 --> 02:28:12,550
We need to go back,
tell the lieutenant.

1065
02:28:16,429 --> 02:28:18,222
Let's go.

1066
02:28:34,739 --> 02:28:37,241
I'm hit!

1067
02:29:18,116 --> 02:29:21,076
Do it! Split up!

1068
02:29:21,161 --> 02:29:23,287
Get back!

1069
02:29:36,259 --> 02:29:39,762
One of us needs to stay here
and hold 'em off.

1070
02:29:46,061 --> 02:29:48,062
We'll be all right.

1071
02:29:53,485 --> 02:29:56,654
My friend here doesn't have long.

1072
02:29:56,738 --> 02:29:59,490
So, you go.

1073
02:30:01,618 --> 02:30:02,534
You go on ahead.

1074
02:30:25,392 --> 02:30:27,184
Witt.

1075
02:31:13,356 --> 02:31:16,608
They're coming.

1076
02:31:16,693 --> 02:31:18,360
I gotta go.

1077
02:31:18,445 --> 02:31:20,946
I don't want you to be afraid.

1078
02:31:21,030 --> 02:31:24,324
Just hide out here till you hear firing.

1079
02:31:24,409 --> 02:31:26,660
Then push on down the river.

1080
02:32:06,993 --> 02:32:09,912
- Where's Coombs?
- Get back. Get back. They're coming!

1081
02:32:11,831 --> 02:32:14,208
Fall back.

1082
02:32:15,335 --> 02:32:17,669
Where's Witt?
Fife, where's Witt?

1083
02:32:24,010 --> 02:32:25,928
Fife, where's Witt?

1084
02:32:29,808 --> 02:32:32,684
Fife. Fife, where's Witt?

1085
02:34:15,788 --> 02:34:17,873
America.

1086
02:37:06,959 --> 02:37:09,628
Where's your spark now?

1087
02:37:31,943 --> 02:37:35,487
Now, I know you men have been making
and drinking this goddamn swipe.

1088
02:37:35,571 --> 02:37:37,697
That's okay by me.

1089
02:37:37,782 --> 02:37:39,366
Everything a lie.

1090
02:37:39,450 --> 02:37:42,953
Any man in an outfit of mine can
get as drunk as he wants to every night.

1091
02:37:43,037 --> 02:37:45,163
Everything you hear, everything you see.

1092
02:37:45,248 --> 02:37:49,334
As long as he's ready and in shape to make
reveille and carry out any assignment he is given.

1093
02:37:49,418 --> 02:37:53,213
If he can't do that,
he's gonna have trouble from me.

1094
02:37:53,297 --> 02:37:55,423
So much to spew out.

1095
02:37:55,508 --> 02:37:57,425
Now, I prefer to think of myself
as a family man...

1096
02:37:57,510 --> 02:38:00,595
and that's what we all are here,
whether we like it or not.

1097
02:38:00,680 --> 02:38:03,598
We are a family.

1098
02:38:03,683 --> 02:38:05,934
I'm the father.

1099
02:38:06,018 --> 02:38:09,729
Guess that makes
Sergeant Welsh here the mother.

1100
02:38:09,814 --> 02:38:12,357
They just keep coming, one after another.

1101
02:38:12,441 --> 02:38:16,069
And whether you guys like it or not, that
makes you all the children in this family.

1102
02:38:16,154 --> 02:38:19,531
Now, a family can have only one head,
and that is the father.

1103
02:38:19,615 --> 02:38:24,411
Father's the head, mother runs it.
That's the way it's gonna work here.

1104
02:38:24,495 --> 02:38:27,247
If any of you men want to see me
about anything...

1105
02:38:27,331 --> 02:38:29,541
- You're in a box.
- Anything at all...

1106
02:38:29,625 --> 02:38:31,042
A moving box.

1107
02:38:31,127 --> 02:38:33,545
You will find that I am available.

1108
02:38:33,629 --> 02:38:38,508
This war is not gonna be over by next Christmas.
It's gonna be a long time before we get home.

1109
02:38:38,593 --> 02:38:40,594
They want you dead...

1110
02:38:43,097 --> 02:38:45,098
or in their lie.

1111
02:38:50,271 --> 02:38:52,939
Only one thing a man can do...

1112
02:38:55,568 --> 02:38:57,903
find something that's his...

1113
02:39:00,781 --> 02:39:03,241
make an island for himself.

1114
02:39:16,422 --> 02:39:20,300
If I never meet you in this life...

1115
02:39:20,384 --> 02:39:22,594
let me feel the lack.

1116
02:39:30,978 --> 02:39:33,188
A glance from your eyes...

1117
02:39:33,272 --> 02:39:35,523
and my life will be yours.

1118
02:40:24,573 --> 02:40:28,493
Somethin' I can come back to.
Some kind of foundation.

1119
02:40:28,577 --> 02:40:33,248
I mean, I don't know what, you know...
what your plans are, but...

1120
02:40:33,332 --> 02:40:34,749
I'm determined now.

1121
02:40:34,834 --> 02:40:37,752
I've been through
the thick and thin of it.

1122
02:40:37,837 --> 02:40:41,423
You know, I may be young,
but I've lived plenty of life.

1123
02:40:41,507 --> 02:40:43,925
I'm ready to start living it good.

1124
02:40:44,010 --> 02:40:48,847
You know, my daddy always told me it's gonna
get a whole lot worse before it gets better.

1125
02:40:48,931 --> 02:40:53,351
You know, 'cause life ain't supposed
to be that hard when you're young.

1126
02:40:53,436 --> 02:40:57,856
Well, I... I figure after this,
the worst is gonna be gone though.

1127
02:40:57,940 --> 02:41:01,401
It's time for things to get better.
That's what I want.

1128
02:41:02,486 --> 02:41:04,571
That's what's gonna happen.

1129
02:41:05,698 --> 02:41:08,450
I'm getting older now.

1130
02:41:08,534 --> 02:41:11,786
By no means old, but older.

1131
02:41:11,871 --> 02:41:14,873
Where is it that we were together?

1132
02:41:18,169 --> 02:41:21,212
Who were you that I lived with...

1133
02:41:25,217 --> 02:41:27,344
walked with?

1134
02:41:34,393 --> 02:41:36,394
The brother.

1135
02:41:42,943 --> 02:41:44,944
The friend.

1136
02:42:11,555 --> 02:42:13,890
Darkness and light.

1137
02:42:15,017 --> 02:42:18,144
Strife and love.

1138
02:42:18,229 --> 02:42:22,649
Are they the workings of one mind...

1139
02:42:22,733 --> 02:42:25,735
the features of the same face?

1140
02:42:40,334 --> 02:42:42,377
O my soul...

1141
02:42:44,130 --> 02:42:46,631
let me be in you now.

1142
02:42:52,179 --> 02:42:54,848
Look out through my eyes.

1143
02:42:55,891 --> 02:42:58,893
Look out at the things you made.

1144
02:43:03,232 --> 02:43:05,900
All things shining.
