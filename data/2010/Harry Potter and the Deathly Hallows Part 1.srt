In time, the brothers reached a river

But being learned in the magical arts...

1183
01:50:50,801 --> 01:50:55,978
...the three brothers simply
waved their wands and made a bridge.

1184
01:50:57,307 --> 01:50:59,412
Before they could cross, however...

1185
01:50:59,576 --> 01:51:03,683
...they found their path blocked
by a hooded figure.

1186
01:51:03,947 --> 01:51:07,827
It was Death, and he felt cheated.

1187
01:51:07,985 --> 01:51:11,057
Cheated because travelers would
normally drown in the river.

1188
01:51:11,221 --> 01:51:13,292
But Death was cunning.

1189
01:51:13,924 --> 01:51:16,928
He pretended to congratulate
the three brothers on their magic...

1190
01:51:17,094 --> 01:51:22,373
...and said that each had earned a prize for
having been clever enough to evade him.

1191
01:51:22,933 --> 01:51:27,507
The oldest asked for a wand
more powerful than any in existence.

1192
01:51:27,671 --> 01:51:32,279
So Death fashioned him one
from an elder tree that stood nearby.

1193
01:51:33,677 --> 01:51:37,989
The second brother decided he wanted
to humiliate Death even further...

1194
01:51:38,148 --> 01:51:42,597
...and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from the grave.

1195
01:51:43,020 --> 01:51:47,332
So Death plucked a stone from the river
and offered it to him.

1196
01:51:48,058 --> 01:51:52,029
Finally,
Death turned to the third brother.

1197
01:51:53,230 --> 01:51:54,675
A humble man...

1198
01:51:54,831 --> 01:51:59,041
...he asked for something that would
allow him to go forth from that place...

1199
01:51:59,202 --> 01:52:02,376
...without being followed by Death.

1200
01:52:03,473 --> 01:52:09,355
And so it was that Death reluctantly
handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.
