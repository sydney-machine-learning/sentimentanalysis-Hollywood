1
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:15,210
Took a job

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,680
Working late

3
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:21,845
Jacking cars from out of state

4
00:00:59,258 --> 00:01:00,316
Who's there?

5
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,153
Who's there?

6
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:20,937
Help!

7
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:47,598
What do you want?

8
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:33,577
"Some say the world will end in fire

9
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,717
"Some say in ice

10
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:42,455
"From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire

11
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:47,154
"But if I had to perish twice

12
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:51,728
"I think I know enough of hate

13
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:54,829
"To say that for destruction ice

14
00:02:56,608 --> 00:02:58,439
"Is also great

15
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:02,075
"And would suffice"

16
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:05,709
You know, I've got an English final.

17
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:08,009
I gotta focus.

18
00:03:22,934 --> 00:03:24,333
Marry me.

19
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,696
No.

20
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:36,912
Marry me.

21
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:43,019
Change me.

22
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:50,694
Okay, I will if you marry me.

23
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:52,923
It's called a compromise.

24
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,468
Let's just call it coercion.

25
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,097
It's not fair.

26
00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:05,769
Marriage is just...

27
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:07,835
It's a piece of paper.

28
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:13,214
Where I'm from,
it's the way one says, "I love you."

29
00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:18,083
Well, where I come from, at my age,

30
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:23,117
it's the way one says,
"I just got knocked up."

31
00:04:26,364 --> 00:04:30,095
So, you're worried
about what people will think?

32
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,203
You know,
two out of three marriages end in divorce.

33
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:41,745
Well, I think you'll find
the vampirelhuman divorce rate

34
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:43,610
is a little lower.

35
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:50,054
So marry me.

36
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:55,925
I can't.

37
00:04:57,996 --> 00:05:00,123
I have to be back at 4:00.

38
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:25,547
4:00 on the dot.

39
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:29,051
That kid trying to brown-nose me now
or something?

40
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:33,253
He has a name.
Now he's too punctual for you?

41
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,834
Okay.

42
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:46,942
You understand
why you're being punished, right?

43
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:49,944
I know, I put you through hell.

44
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:51,607
Yes, you did.

45
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:56,344
But I have other reasons for grounding you.

46
00:05:56,421 --> 00:05:57,718
Like...

47
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:04,862
I just want you to get some separation
from him.

48
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:10,291
Dad, there's nothing you can say.

49
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:14,399
Edward is in my life.

50
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:18,967
Yeah, I'm gathering that.

51
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,639
So, all right, how about this?

52
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:26,249
I'll make you a deal.

53
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:29,845
You're not grounded anymore

54
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:37,092
if you use your new-found freedom to
see some of your other friends, too, like...

55
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:38,953
Like Jacob.

56
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:41,459
He's going through
a really tough time right now.

57
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:43,728
His dad's really worried about him.

58
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:46,533
I remember when that was you.

59
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:49,605
You needed a friend.

60
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:51,567
Jake was there.

61
00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:58,381
Hey, it's Jake. Leave a message.

62
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:03,450
Jacob hadn't talked to me in weeks.

63
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:08,125
I wanted to fix it, he just...
He wouldn't give me the chance.

64
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:13,386
And tumbling, tumbling

65
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:17,159
Don't go fascination

66
00:07:18,536 --> 00:07:25,442
If just for tonight darling, let's get lost

67
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,380
If just for tonight darling

68
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,448
Let's get lost

69
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:40,788
If just for tonight darling

70
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:43,384
Let's get lost

71
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:02,439
You scared me.

72
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:06,982
You're going down to the reservation.

73
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,677
How did you...

74
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:11,383
Alice.

75
00:08:14,893 --> 00:08:16,383
Hey, did you do this to my truck?

76
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:19,687
Bella, you have to understand.

77
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:21,527
Your safety is everything to me.

78
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,032
Jacob's not gonna hurt me.

79
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:25,831
Not intentionally,
but the wolves have no control.

80
00:08:25,904 --> 00:08:26,928
Edward.

81
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:31,303
I have until graduation to see him.

82
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:36,604
And then I'll be one of you,

83
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:38,415
and he'll hate me forever.

84
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:40,512
Well, I'm sorry.

85
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:54,727
- No way. Stop.
- Throw it away.

86
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,130
- Good.
- Hey.

87
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:58,761
- Just in time. All right, check it out.
- All right. Let's see, we got.

88
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:01,362
- "My fellow students." Right?
- Good.

89
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,737
- Cute.
- Right? "We are the future.

90
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:06,106
"Anything is possible, if you just believe."

91
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:07,337
Nice.

92
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:09,235
Perfect.

93
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:10,542
And you got yourself a speech.

94
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:13,880
No, this'll be my speech when I want
everyone to throw diplomas at my head.

95
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:15,544
So, thank you.

96
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:18,653
You gotta embrace the clichés, Jess.

97
00:09:18,723 --> 00:09:21,089
They are the bread and butter
of all valedictorians.

98
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:23,720
And that is why you are not valedictorian.

99
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:25,922
Jess doesn't need clichés.

100
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:27,089
The speech is gonna be epic.

101
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,764
Epic? It'll change lives.

102
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:32,163
I've decided to throw a party.

103
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:35,437
After all, how many times
are we gonna graduate high school?

104
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:37,664
A party? At your place?

105
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:40,903
I've never seen your house.

106
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:42,503
No one's ever seen their house.

107
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:44,271
Another party, Alice?

108
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:45,708
It'll be fun.

109
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:47,479
Yeah. That's what you said last time.

110
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:54,015
- Hey, Angela.
- Yeah?

111
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:55,081
Do you need some help with those?

112
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:03,158
...be sending money
'cause it's the polite thing to do,

113
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:04,292
and then you'll be raking it in.

114
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:06,394
Wait a minute. People give you money?

115
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,549
I know you know what she saw. Tell me.

116
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:29,453
It was nothing.

117
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:32,224
You looked worried.

118
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:36,598
Just that everyone noticed
how strange Alice is.

119
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:40,037
I think that ship sailed long ago.

120
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:45,239
I wonder what's wrong.

121
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,074
Their son went missing in Seattle
over a year ago.

122
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:50,807
Charlie's doing what he can, but...

123
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:55,582
You know something about this?

124
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,523
We've been tracking the situation in Seattle
for a while.

125
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,927
Unexplained disappearances. Killings.

126
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,030
If the situation gets any more conspicuous,
the Volturi will step in.

127
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,097
If they go to Seattle, they could come here.

128
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:15,639
They could see I'm still human.

129
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:17,299
It won't get that far.

130
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:20,238
But we'll go to Seattle if we have to.

131
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,974
- I'll fax these down, first thing.
- Thank you.

132
00:11:26,117 --> 00:11:27,675
- Hey.
- Hey.

133
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,615
- You ready for dinner?
- Yeah.

134
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:34,754
It is still just you and I, right?

135
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,158
No, I'm just dropping her off.

136
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:40,021
See you later.

137
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:41,291
Bye.

138
00:11:43,968 --> 00:11:47,426
Bella, my parents wanted to remind you
about the airline ticket

139
00:11:47,505 --> 00:11:50,474
- you got for your birthday.
- What airline ticket?

140
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:54,771
A round trip ticket to see Mom in Florida.

141
00:11:55,713 --> 00:11:57,078
That was generous.

142
00:11:57,148 --> 00:11:59,582
It expires soon,
so you might want to use it this weekend.

143
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:02,643
Well, I can't just drop everything and go.

144
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:05,982
It might be your last chance to see her
before you graduate.

145
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:09,192
Might not be a bad idea.

146
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,627
Get out of town for a couple days.
Get some distance.

147
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:15,092
Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing Mom.

148
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:19,196
As long as you use the companion ticket.

149
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,397
Wait. There's two tickets?

150
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:25,239
Super.

151
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:27,771
That makes me really happy.

152
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:32,646
I did want to see my mom.

153
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:36,278
I wanted to know
that her life was full and satisfying.

154
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:40,684
Aren't you gonna miss this?

155
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:44,560
Can't you just feel the vitamin D
soaking up in your pores?

156
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,460
Yeah, I am gonna miss this.

157
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,303
You know, colleges in Florida
are a lot sunnier.

158
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:02,471
I'm just saying,
if you go to the University of Alaska,

159
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:04,572
I'm never gonna see you.

160
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,120
They have a really great science program.

161
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,848
You mean, Edward program?

162
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:18,986
The way he watches you,

163
00:13:19,397 --> 00:13:23,026
it's like he's willing to leap in front of you
and take a bullet or something.

164
00:13:23,668 --> 00:13:25,465
Is that a bad thing?

165
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,535
It's an intense thing.

166
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:30,765
You're different with him.

167
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:33,335
He moves, you move.

168
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:35,503
Like magnets.

169
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:38,712
I don't know, we're just...

170
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:41,649
In love. I get it.

171
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:46,946
I just want to make sure
you're making the right choices for you.

172
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:49,692
You know, 'cause you're the one
that's gonna have to live with them.

173
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:56,360
All right, enough with the heavy.

174
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:04,533
Mom.

175
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:06,440
Congraduation.

176
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:08,274
I didn't want you
to spend any of your money.

177
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:10,109
I didn't, come on.

178
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:25,789
- Are these all our old trip T-shirts?
- Mmm-hmm.

179
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:28,263
- Get out!
- I saved them all.

180
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:31,358
I thought they'd make a good quilt,
keep you warm up in Alaska.

181
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,404
Remember this one? Ensenada.

182
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:38,042
- The Snake Pit.
- Yeah.

183
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,472
But this one is my favorite, here.

184
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:43,605
The three-headed lobster from Maine.

185
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:46,678
- This is amazing.
- Honey, I'm glad you like it.

186
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:48,241
I just figured, you know,
when you get older,

187
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,616
have kids, we can add to it.

188
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:52,554
Maybe go visit the world's largest
ketchup bottle or something.

189
00:14:52,623 --> 00:14:53,920
Thanks.

190
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:58,326
I'm glad you like it.

191
00:14:58,863 --> 00:15:02,299
Just thought you should have
a little piece of me up there in Alaska.

192
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:06,700
- Mom...
- Yeah?

193
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:11,942
I miss you.

194
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:14,911
Honey, I miss you, too.

195
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:35,031
Are you sure this is where you saw her?

196
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,963
She's almost here.

197
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:51,971
On your left!

198
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:29,177
Wait!

199
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:30,750
She's in their territory.

200
00:16:32,623 --> 00:16:33,885
She'll get away!

201
00:16:35,593 --> 00:16:37,151
No, she won't!

202
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:13,821
Emmett, no!

203
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:48,624
Do you regret going?

204
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:51,893
No.

205
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:55,835
It was really great seeing my mom.

206
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,674
Just really hard saying goodbye.

207
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,137
It doesn't have to be goodbye.

208
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:03,339
Is that why you asked me to go?

209
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:06,314
You thought I was gonna change my mind?

210
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:09,213
I'm always hoping for that.

211
00:18:10,821 --> 00:18:12,015
What?

212
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:16,357
If I asked you to stay in the car, would you?

213
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,032
Of course not.

214
00:18:36,547 --> 00:18:37,741
Hey.

215
00:18:38,949 --> 00:18:40,348
Charlie said you left town.

216
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:42,814
Yeah. To visit my mom. Why?

217
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:46,518
He's checking to see if you're still human.

218
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,720
Look, I'm here to warn you.

219
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:51,588
If your kind come on our land again...

220
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:53,387
Wait, what?

221
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:57,257
You didn't tell her?

222
00:18:57,668 --> 00:18:58,862
Just leave it alone, Jacob.

223
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:01,960
Tell me what?

224
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:06,043
Emmett and Paul had a misunderstanding.

225
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,073
It's nothing to worry about.

226
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:09,476
Listen to you.

227
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,675
Did you lie to get her out of town, too?

228
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:13,478
You should just leave.

229
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:15,075
Now.

230
00:19:15,886 --> 00:19:17,979
She has a right to know.

231
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:20,214
She is the one the redhead wants.

232
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,418
Victoria?

233
00:19:25,229 --> 00:19:26,856
Alice's vision.

234
00:19:27,898 --> 00:19:29,923
I was trying to protect you.

235
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:31,928
By lying to me.

236
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,701
Okay, we're gonna talk about this, but...

237
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:38,901
You.

238
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:41,943
Why haven't you called me back?

239
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:46,449
I had nothing to say.

240
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:51,210
- Well, I have tons. Hold on.
- Hey.

241
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,521
Bella.

242
00:19:54,892 --> 00:19:56,519
Edward, you have to trust me.

243
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:58,186
I do trust you.

244
00:19:58,863 --> 00:20:00,228
It's him I don't trust.

245
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:14,842
Hey, lose the grin, Jacob.
We're just going for a ride.

246
00:20:14,912 --> 00:20:15,936
Hold on tight.

247
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:24,078
Last born of the clan

248
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:27,283
First one to be free

249
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:30,350
Lived inside a house

250
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:32,589
Are you sure this is a good idea?

251
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:36,633
I am the vampire girl, remember?

252
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:39,201
Hey, look who's back!

253
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:40,426
What up, Bella?

254
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:42,165
- Quil? You, too?
- Yep.

255
00:20:42,506 --> 00:20:43,666
Finally made the pack.

256
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:45,265
I'm glad you're here, Bella.

257
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:48,004
Maybe we can get a break
from Jake's obsessive inner monologue.

258
00:20:48,078 --> 00:20:49,170
"I wish Bella would call."

259
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:50,978
"I wish Bella wouldn't call."

260
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:53,846
- "Maybe I should call Bella."
- "Maybe I should call Bella and hang up."

261
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:57,313
All right, you can shut up now.

262
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:03,718
Bella, this is Leah Clearwater,
Harry's daughter.

263
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:07,321
Hey. I'm really sorry about your father.

264
00:21:07,765 --> 00:21:10,131
If you're here to torture Jacob some more,
feel free to leave.

265
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:15,030
Fun, isn't she?

266
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:18,867
- Bella, hi!
- Hey.

267
00:21:19,176 --> 00:21:22,043
I was wondering
when we'd see your face around here again.

268
00:21:22,112 --> 00:21:23,477
Yeah. Same here.

269
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:24,636
Sam, we good?

270
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:28,376
We're good. She won't be getting
through our line any time soon.

271
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:30,443
- Cool.
- Yeah, that's right boys!

272
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,062
So when did Leah join the pack?

273
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:46,196
Around when her dad died.
Her brother, Seth, also phased.

274
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:50,302
He's only 15,
one of the youngest we've had.

275
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:54,508
Sam keeps him home studying,
but he's chomping at the bit.

276
00:21:55,312 --> 00:21:57,109
I wish it was Leah who'd stay home.

277
00:21:58,315 --> 00:22:00,510
Come on, don't be such a guy.

278
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:03,052
No, it's not a chick thing.

279
00:22:03,454 --> 00:22:06,218
It's, you know, a triangle thing.

280
00:22:06,857 --> 00:22:10,452
We all have to live
the LeahlSamlEmily pain-fest.

281
00:22:11,896 --> 00:22:13,227
Wolf telepathy, remember?

282
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:16,058
So Sam dumps Leah for Emily?

283
00:22:16,734 --> 00:22:20,602
Yeah, it wasn't like that.
Sam hates himself for hurting Leah.

284
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:23,931
But Emily was the one.

285
00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:28,040
I guess it sort of chooses you sometimes.

286
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,014
It's more than some crush, Bella.

287
00:22:32,082 --> 00:22:34,243
Sam imprinted on Emily.

288
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:38,348
Do I even want to know what that is?

289
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:50,193
Imprinting on someone is like...

290
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,629
Like when you see her,

291
00:22:55,906 --> 00:22:57,703
everything changes.

292
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:03,009
All of a sudden,
it's not gravity holding you to the planet.

293
00:23:04,114 --> 00:23:05,411
It's her.

294
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:08,182
Nothing else matters.

295
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,445
You would do anything,

296
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:14,786
be anything for her.

297
00:23:17,795 --> 00:23:20,059
Sounds like you know the feeling.

298
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:25,232
Have you

299
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:29,306
imprinted on someone?

300
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:35,901
You'd know if I had.

301
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:43,110
I just have a direct line to Sam's thoughts.

302
00:23:44,922 --> 00:23:46,651
So for now you're

303
00:23:47,191 --> 00:23:48,453
still you.

304
00:23:51,095 --> 00:23:53,120
And you're still you.

305
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:55,458
Yeah.

306
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:02,302
Until graduation.

307
00:24:04,108 --> 00:24:05,439
Graduation?

308
00:24:07,077 --> 00:24:08,806
You knew this was gonna happen.

309
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:09,971
Not in a month!

310
00:24:12,483 --> 00:24:16,419
I mean, not before you've...
You've even lived.

311
00:24:17,888 --> 00:24:19,480
Or before I could...

312
00:24:23,394 --> 00:24:27,125
For a second, just a second, I thought...

313
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:31,363
But he's got his hooks in you so deep...

314
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:34,834
I decided this, not him.

315
00:24:34,905 --> 00:24:37,271
Bella, they're not even alive.

316
00:24:38,275 --> 00:24:39,833
It makes me sick.

317
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:45,311
Better you really be dead than one of them.

318
00:24:58,629 --> 00:25:00,062
I can't believe you said that.

319
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:06,965
Edward was right, I shouldn't have come.

320
00:25:07,037 --> 00:25:09,938
Bella, come on. Please.

321
00:25:13,077 --> 00:25:14,271
I'm sorry.

322
00:26:24,014 --> 00:26:28,314
You know, Edward could
at least respect meal times.

323
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,381
I was just with Jake.

324
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:32,244
Oh.

325
00:26:33,524 --> 00:26:34,821
Good.

326
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:42,762
I'll just give you two some privacy, then.

327
00:26:45,102 --> 00:26:47,070
- Hey.
- Do you understand how worried I've been?

328
00:26:47,471 --> 00:26:48,904
I was perfectly safe.

329
00:26:48,972 --> 00:26:51,133
I almost broke the treaty to make sure.

330
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:55,303
- I know I smell like a dog. I'm sorry.
- No, something's wrong.

331
00:27:02,486 --> 00:27:04,147
Edward, what's wrong?

332
00:27:04,221 --> 00:27:06,212
Someone's been in here.

333
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:13,886
Who was it?
Someone we know?

334
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:17,926
This stranger, I didn't recognize his scent.

335
00:27:18,001 --> 00:27:19,662
A nomad passing through?

336
00:27:19,736 --> 00:27:21,704
A passerby wouldn't
have left Bella's father alive.

337
00:27:22,206 --> 00:27:26,108
The scent disappeared
about 5 miles south of Bella's house.

338
00:27:26,977 --> 00:27:28,877
Someone's orchestrating this.

339
00:27:28,946 --> 00:27:30,311
Victoria?

340
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:32,539
I would have seen her decide.

341
00:27:32,783 --> 00:27:33,875
Has to be the Volturi.

342
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:37,213
I don't think it's the Volturi, either.

343
00:27:37,287 --> 00:27:39,050
I've been watching Aro's decisions, too.

344
00:27:39,122 --> 00:27:40,453
So we keep looking.

345
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:42,958
We'll also take shifts
guarding Bella at her house.

346
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,859
Another protection detail?

347
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:46,659
Rosalie.

348
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:48,720
No, she's right.

349
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:53,636
You can't protect me, watch my dad
and search for the intruder.

350
00:27:53,704 --> 00:27:55,467
And for Victoria.

351
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:57,200
And keep yourselves fed.

352
00:27:57,274 --> 00:27:59,071
I'm not leaving you here defenseless.

353
00:27:59,142 --> 00:28:01,702
Well, I'm not gonna let you starve.

354
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:04,170
And I wouldn't be unprotected. I have...

355
00:28:06,183 --> 00:28:07,411
What?

356
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:17,522
Whoever it was, he left his stink behind.

357
00:28:18,228 --> 00:28:21,959
It'll be hard to miss when we cross it again.
We'll handle it from here.

358
00:28:22,165 --> 00:28:24,827
We don't need you to handle anything.

359
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:25,994
Or anyone.

360
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:27,730
I could care less what you need.

361
00:28:27,804 --> 00:28:29,738
All right, we're done here.

362
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:31,774
- No, you're done here.
- Stop!

363
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:36,101
I'm tired of this.
From now on, I'm Switzerland, okay?

364
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:39,381
Edward hated the idea,

365
00:28:39,449 --> 00:28:42,145
but it wasn't about rivalry anymore.

366
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:45,583
It was about my safety, and Charlie's.

367
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:51,094
In the days that followed,
I got them to at least try to work together.

368
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:59,196
The wolves took over
so the Cullens could hunt.

369
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:04,266
It wasn't exactly an easy alliance.

370
00:29:20,624 --> 00:29:21,886
Doesn't he own a shirt?

371
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,427
I'm good here. You should go.

372
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:31,326
I'm not gonna be gone long.

373
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:33,961
Don't rush. You need to hunt.

374
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:52,621
Maybe rush a little bit.

375
00:29:58,261 --> 00:30:00,058
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hi.

376
00:30:10,974 --> 00:30:12,737
So, what do you wanna do today?

377
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:15,801
Bike, hike, just hang? Your call.

378
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:18,213
But we're going to a party tonight.

379
00:30:21,084 --> 00:30:22,949
Are you sure this is okay?

380
00:30:23,553 --> 00:30:25,851
I really hate being a party crasher.

381
00:30:26,256 --> 00:30:28,952
Technically,
you're a council meeting crasher.

382
00:30:29,693 --> 00:30:34,357
You see? The council leaders,
Dad, Quil's grandpa and Sue Clearwater.

383
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:37,323
She took over for Harry when he died.

384
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:39,198
Okay, I should not be here.

385
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,395
You're okay. I thought...

386
00:30:43,507 --> 00:30:47,204
I mean, they thought it would
be good for you to hear the histories.

387
00:30:47,277 --> 00:30:48,835
The histories?

388
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:52,314
The tribe's histories? Aren't they secret?

389
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,779
We all got a role to play,
and you're part of this.

390
00:30:57,587 --> 00:31:00,613
I mean, it's the first time
Seth, Leah and Quil'll hear them, too.

391
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,853
But you are the first outsider. Ever.

392
00:31:06,263 --> 00:31:09,164
If I had known that, I would have, like...

393
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:12,467
- I don't know, dressed better.
- Jake!

394
00:31:13,737 --> 00:31:16,729
- Hey.
- It's about time you got here.

395
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:19,833
Paul's been hoovering the grub,
but I saved you some burgers.

396
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,741
Good looking out, bro.

397
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:24,947
Bella, this is Seth Clearwater,
Leah's brother.

398
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:26,346
- Hi.
- Newest member of the pack.

399
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:29,177
Newest. Bestest. Brightest.

400
00:31:29,252 --> 00:31:30,742
And slowest.

401
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:36,358
- Come on, your dad's about to start.
- Okay.

402
00:31:37,761 --> 00:31:41,424
The Quileutes have been a small tribe
from the beginning,

403
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:45,091
but we have always had magic in our blood.

404
00:31:46,803 --> 00:31:48,532
We were great spirit warriors,

405
00:31:49,172 --> 00:31:53,700
shape-shifters that transformed
to the powerful wolf.

406
00:31:55,645 --> 00:31:59,137
This enabled us to scare off our enemies

407
00:31:59,382 --> 00:32:01,475
and protect our tribe.

408
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:08,082
One day,
our warriors came across a creature.

409
00:32:09,593 --> 00:32:11,618
It looked like a man,

410
00:32:11,695 --> 00:32:13,890
but it was hard like stone

411
00:32:14,664 --> 00:32:16,529
and cold as ice.

412
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,781
Our warriors' sharp teeth
finally tore it apart,

413
00:32:40,857 --> 00:32:44,054
but only fire would completely destroy it.

414
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:48,795
They lived in fear
that the cold man was not alone.

415
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,865
And they were right.

416
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:59,208
She took her vengeance out on the village.

417
00:33:01,845 --> 00:33:04,177
Our elder chief, Taha Aki,

418
00:33:04,247 --> 00:33:09,344
was the only spirit warrior left
to save the tribe after his son was killed.

419
00:33:21,698 --> 00:33:25,190
Taha Aki's third wife
could see that he would lose.

420
00:33:26,469 --> 00:33:29,768
The third wife was no magical being,

421
00:33:30,473 --> 00:33:32,703
with no special powers but one,

422
00:33:34,744 --> 00:33:35,972
courage.

423
00:33:47,557 --> 00:33:50,720
The third wife's sacrifice
distracted the cold woman

424
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:53,388
long enough for Taha Aki to destroy her.

425
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:57,229
She saved the tribe.

426
00:33:57,734 --> 00:34:00,828
Over time, our enemies have disappeared.

427
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:03,802
But one remains,

428
00:34:05,308 --> 00:34:06,798
the cold ones.

429
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:12,044
Our magic awakens when they're near,

430
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:14,180
and we sense it now.

431
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:15,684
We feel the threat in our blood.

432
00:34:18,088 --> 00:34:20,215
Something terrible is coming,

433
00:34:22,259 --> 00:34:24,625
and we must all be ready,

434
00:34:25,595 --> 00:34:26,892
all of us.

435
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,181
What did you do to me?

436
00:35:00,263 --> 00:35:01,787
I'm so...

437
00:35:01,865 --> 00:35:04,095
Yeah. I know.

438
00:35:05,735 --> 00:35:06,963
We'll find you someone to drink.

439
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,459
Mine!

440
00:35:15,812 --> 00:35:18,508
Just try not to get killed, will you?

441
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:23,977
I'm gonna need numbers.

442
00:35:25,355 --> 00:35:27,585
Seattle is in a state of terror.

443
00:35:27,657 --> 00:35:31,525
Police are baffled by
the escalating murders and disappearances.

444
00:35:31,594 --> 00:35:35,496
Theories range from a vicious new gang
to a wildly active serial killer.

445
00:35:35,565 --> 00:35:36,589
Reporting live...

446
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:39,965
It's getting worse.
We're going to have to do something.

447
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:44,470
It takes more than one of our kind
to cause the damage they're reporting.

448
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:48,700
Quite a few more.
And they're undisciplined, conspicuous.

449
00:35:48,778 --> 00:35:50,143
It's newborns.

450
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:53,679
What, like new vampires?

451
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,775
In the first few months after the change.

452
00:35:55,852 --> 00:35:59,447
That's when
we're at our most uncontrollable. Vicious.

453
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:01,986
Insane with thirst.

454
00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:04,789
Something to look forward to.

455
00:36:06,663 --> 00:36:09,723
No one's trained these newborns,
but this isn't random.

456
00:36:10,734 --> 00:36:12,725
Someone's creating an army.

457
00:36:13,103 --> 00:36:15,196
Well, now we're definitely going to Seattle.

458
00:36:16,272 --> 00:36:17,967
An army of vampires?

459
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:20,032
And they've been created to fight someone.

460
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,805
We're the only clan even close to Seattle.

461
00:36:21,878 --> 00:36:23,345
Regardless of why
they were made,

462
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:26,541
if we don't put a stop to them,
the Volturi will.

463
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:28,675
I'm surprised they've let it go on this long.

464
00:36:28,752 --> 00:36:30,185
Maybe they're behind it.

465
00:36:31,454 --> 00:36:34,150
In Italy, I read Aro's mind.

466
00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:35,987
He wants me and Alice to join him,

467
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:39,222
but he knows we'll never choose him
as long as our family's still alive.

468
00:36:39,295 --> 00:36:41,957
An army could solve that for him.

469
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:51,767
Hey.

470
00:36:52,642 --> 00:36:54,439
Did you eat dinner yet?

471
00:36:56,346 --> 00:36:58,041
No, I haven't.

472
00:37:01,384 --> 00:37:05,650
This kid, Riley Biers,
disappeared over a year ago,

473
00:37:06,756 --> 00:37:10,317
and his poor parents have been papering
Seattle with these things ever since.

474
00:37:12,362 --> 00:37:13,886
You think they should just give up?

475
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,528
Well, I wouldn't if it were you.

476
00:37:21,971 --> 00:37:23,370
Not ever.

477
00:37:29,712 --> 00:37:31,612
I have to figure out
what to tell people.

478
00:37:32,782 --> 00:37:35,444
Why I won't be home for Christmases,

479
00:37:36,085 --> 00:37:38,280
and why I won't visit,

480
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:42,448
why they'll never see me again.

481
00:37:42,692 --> 00:37:46,526
After a few decades,
everyone you know will be dead.

482
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:50,596
Problem solved.

483
00:37:55,805 --> 00:37:58,296
Why are you so against
me becoming like you?

484
00:37:58,842 --> 00:38:00,434
I've told you.

485
00:38:03,513 --> 00:38:05,242
Be honest with me.

486
00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:08,016
There's more.

487
00:38:08,485 --> 00:38:12,945
I know the consequences
of this choice you're making.

488
00:38:18,194 --> 00:38:19,593
I've lived through it.

489
00:38:21,464 --> 00:38:24,092
And to let you suffer that...

490
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:29,230
You believe I have a soul, and I don't.

491
00:38:32,742 --> 00:38:34,334
But to risk yours,

492
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,504
just for the sake of
never having to lose you,

493
00:38:39,816 --> 00:38:42,080
that's the most selfish thing I'll ever do.

494
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:50,482
I thought that you were afraid
that I'd be too different.

495
00:38:52,662 --> 00:38:57,861
You know, like, I wouldn't be warm,
and I wouldn't smell the same.

496
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,237
You'll always be my Bella.

497
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,491
My Bella, just less fragile.

498
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,573
Gosh, it's so pretty here.

499
00:39:52,155 --> 00:39:55,215
So, Alice has planned
a big graduation party.

500
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:57,451
Which you're invited to.

501
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:04,827
Yeah, I figured that.

502
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:13,735
What?

503
00:40:15,712 --> 00:40:18,237
I just wanted to do this differently.

504
00:40:18,648 --> 00:40:19,979
Smoother.

505
00:40:21,551 --> 00:40:23,485
But now I'm out of time.

506
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:26,118
Do what?

507
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,618
You need to hear the truth, Bella,

508
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:32,591
understand all your options.

509
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:35,926
And you need to know

510
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,730
that I'm in love with you,

511
00:40:41,204 --> 00:40:44,230
and I want you to choose me
instead of him.

512
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:48,470
I thought you understood.

513
00:40:51,314 --> 00:40:53,782
- I don't feel that way for you.
- I don't buy it.

514
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,750
What don't you buy?

515
00:40:57,253 --> 00:40:58,550
That's how I feel.

516
00:40:59,322 --> 00:41:02,883
You feel something else for me.
You just won't admit it.

517
00:41:04,227 --> 00:41:06,195
So I'm not giving up.

518
00:41:06,996 --> 00:41:09,123
I'm gonna fight for you

519
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:14,629
until your heart stops beating.

520
00:41:15,004 --> 00:41:16,733
Well, then you're not gonna
have to fight for long.

521
00:41:16,806 --> 00:41:19,104
You're rushing into it because
you're afraid you'll change your mind.

522
00:41:19,175 --> 00:41:20,767
No, I'm not.

523
00:41:22,178 --> 00:41:23,975
I know what I want.

524
00:41:25,415 --> 00:41:28,441
You wouldn't have to change for me, Bella,

525
00:41:29,152 --> 00:41:31,347
or say goodbye to anybody.

526
00:41:32,422 --> 00:41:34,982
I can give you more than him.

527
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:40,224
I mean, he probably can't even kiss you
without hurting you.

528
00:41:41,664 --> 00:41:43,029
Feel that?

529
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:46,263
Flesh and blood.

530
00:41:46,903 --> 00:41:48,632
And warmth.

531
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,576
God!

532
00:42:03,252 --> 00:42:04,480
God!

533
00:42:12,328 --> 00:42:13,352
Edward!

534
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:15,693
If you ever touch her
against her will again...

535
00:42:15,765 --> 00:42:17,756
- Don't do this here!
- She's not sure what she wants.

536
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:19,267
- Don't do this here!
- Let me give you a clue.

537
00:42:19,335 --> 00:42:20,734
Wait for her to say the words.

538
00:42:20,803 --> 00:42:23,067
Fine! And she will.

539
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,838
Jacob, just go, okay?

540
00:42:24,907 --> 00:42:27,637
Hey, hey, hey! Easy, guys. Easy.

541
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:30,706
Let's take it down a notch. All right?

542
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,042
What's going on?

543
00:42:38,955 --> 00:42:39,944
I kissed Bella.

544
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,993
And she broke her hand.

545
00:42:48,264 --> 00:42:49,458
Punching my face.

546
00:42:51,701 --> 00:42:53,066
Total misunderstanding.

547
00:42:55,705 --> 00:42:57,104
It's just a sprain.

548
00:42:57,273 --> 00:42:59,434
It should heal fairly quickly.

549
00:43:00,943 --> 00:43:04,379
Trying to walk and chew gum
at the same time again, Bella?

550
00:43:05,214 --> 00:43:06,704
I punched a werewolf in the face.

551
00:43:06,883 --> 00:43:10,478
Badass.
You're gonna be one tough little newborn.

552
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:13,384
Tough enough to take you on.

553
00:43:19,695 --> 00:43:21,128
Don't worry about it.

554
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,992
Got any leads?

555
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:30,703
No sign of the intruder. But Victoria
continues to make appearances.

556
00:43:38,281 --> 00:43:40,806
Go blather to someone else
about the joys of becoming a newborn.

557
00:43:45,354 --> 00:43:46,582
Okay...

558
00:43:47,657 --> 00:43:49,090
Rosalie,

559
00:43:51,227 --> 00:43:53,923
I don't understand what I did
to make you hate me so much.

560
00:43:54,263 --> 00:43:55,321
Hate...

561
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,560
I don't hate you.

562
00:44:01,737 --> 00:44:04,604
I don't particularly like you, but...

563
00:44:09,178 --> 00:44:11,271
Bella, I envy you.

564
00:44:12,281 --> 00:44:13,543
What?

565
00:44:14,851 --> 00:44:17,149
- That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

566
00:44:19,388 --> 00:44:20,855
You have a choice.

567
00:44:21,123 --> 00:44:22,590
I didn't.

568
00:44:23,526 --> 00:44:27,155
None of us did.
But you do, and you're choosing wrong.

569
00:44:28,264 --> 00:44:31,165
I don't care
how miserable your human life is.

570
00:44:32,034 --> 00:44:34,662
My life is not miserable.

571
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,105
I mean, it's not perfect.
Nobody's life is perfect.

572
00:44:41,577 --> 00:44:42,976
Mine was.

573
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:45,579
Absolutely perfect.

574
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,215
There were things I still wanted,

575
00:44:50,419 --> 00:44:51,909
to be married, with a nice house

576
00:44:51,988 --> 00:44:54,183
and a husband to kiss me
when he came home,

577
00:44:54,624 --> 00:44:56,683
a family of my own.

578
00:44:57,627 --> 00:45:00,994
Royce King was the most eligible bachelor
in town.

579
00:45:02,064 --> 00:45:03,929
I barely knew him.

580
00:45:08,204 --> 00:45:12,163
But I was young.
I was in love with the idea of love.

581
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:17,201
On the last night of my life,
I left a friend's house late.

582
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,770
I wasn't far from home.

583
00:45:18,848 --> 00:45:20,543
There she is.

584
00:45:20,616 --> 00:45:21,640
Hey, Rose!

585
00:45:22,652 --> 00:45:25,018
Come over here! Here. Hold this.

586
00:45:25,888 --> 00:45:27,549
Hey, come over here.

587
00:45:28,024 --> 00:45:30,322
We've been waiting for you.

588
00:45:31,227 --> 00:45:32,888
There she is.

589
00:45:34,297 --> 00:45:35,992
Royce. Royce!

590
00:45:37,433 --> 00:45:39,196
You're drunk.

591
00:45:39,268 --> 00:45:42,760
Isn't she lovely, John?
I told you she was a looker.

592
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:45,363
It's hard to say with all those clothes on.

593
00:45:45,775 --> 00:45:46,969
What do you say, Rose?

594
00:45:47,543 --> 00:45:49,477
- Why don't we take off a few layers?
- Stop it, stop it.

595
00:45:49,946 --> 00:45:51,914
Stop. Stop!

596
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:55,748
I'll see you tomorrow.

597
00:45:55,818 --> 00:45:57,149
Sober.

598
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:00,053
Hey, where do you think you're going?

599
00:46:00,122 --> 00:46:02,522
- I said, get... Come back... Hey!
- Stop! Stop! Get off me!

600
00:46:02,591 --> 00:46:04,559
- You'll do as I say!
- Let go of me! Stop!

601
00:46:04,627 --> 00:46:06,959
Stop! Let go! Stop!

602
00:46:09,665 --> 00:46:12,691
They left me in the street,
thinking I was dead.

603
00:46:13,102 --> 00:46:15,002
Believe me, I wanted to be.

604
00:46:16,706 --> 00:46:18,833
Carlisle found me. He smelled all the blood.

605
00:46:19,308 --> 00:46:22,106
- Thought he was helping me.
- I'm sorry.

606
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,178
I got my revenge on them.

607
00:46:28,684 --> 00:46:30,345
One at a time.

608
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:33,517
Saved Royce for last,
so he'd know I was coming.

609
00:46:52,108 --> 00:46:54,474
I was a little theatrical back then.

610
00:47:03,352 --> 00:47:06,253
Things got better after I found Emmett.

611
00:47:08,691 --> 00:47:10,852
But we'll always be this.

612
00:47:14,563 --> 00:47:15,757
Frozen.

613
00:47:16,899 --> 00:47:18,423
Never moving forward.

614
00:47:20,302 --> 00:47:23,897
That's what I miss the most. Possibilities.

615
00:47:25,274 --> 00:47:27,799
Sitting on a front porch somewhere,

616
00:47:28,044 --> 00:47:30,672
Emmett, gray-haired, by my side,

617
00:47:30,746 --> 00:47:33,374
surrounded by our grandchildren.

618
00:47:34,683 --> 00:47:36,412
Their laughter.

619
00:47:38,421 --> 00:47:41,322
I understand that that's what you want.

620
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:51,131
But there's nothing
I'm ever gonna want more

621
00:47:53,869 --> 00:47:55,461
than Edward.

622
00:47:56,205 --> 00:47:58,139
You're wrong again.

623
00:47:59,975 --> 00:48:03,877
After you've been changed,
there's one thing you'll want more,

624
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,711
one thing you'll kill for.

625
00:48:08,617 --> 00:48:09,982
Blood.

626
00:48:15,758 --> 00:48:18,921
What did I say about a low profile?

627
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,240
Something's coming.

628
00:48:35,344 --> 00:48:39,440
Something bigger than any of us alone.

629
00:48:40,883 --> 00:48:45,445
And if you can't control yourselves,

630
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:50,350
we're all going to die.

631
00:48:54,663 --> 00:48:56,961
What's done is done, just

632
00:48:59,602 --> 00:49:01,934
clean up after yourselves.

633
00:49:10,613 --> 00:49:13,639
They've already drawn too much attention.

634
00:49:13,716 --> 00:49:15,047
So has our inaction.

635
00:49:16,085 --> 00:49:19,748
Others may begin to question
the Volturi's effectiveness.

636
00:49:20,689 --> 00:49:22,156
Let them.

637
00:49:27,696 --> 00:49:29,857
Maybe we should consult with Aro.

638
00:49:34,937 --> 00:49:37,201
Aro's decisions are being watched.

639
00:49:39,275 --> 00:49:41,004
We must decide.

640
00:49:43,445 --> 00:49:46,642
Then decide, sister. It's time.

641
00:49:48,617 --> 00:49:50,380
Yes, it is.

642
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:58,089
Either we let them do
what they were created for,

643
00:49:59,161 --> 00:50:00,958
or we end them.

644
00:50:01,897 --> 00:50:03,865
Decisions, decisions.

645
00:50:14,376 --> 00:50:18,676
When we were five, they asked us
what we wanted to be when we grew up.

646
00:50:18,747 --> 00:50:22,843
Our answers were things
like astronaut, president,

647
00:50:23,485 --> 00:50:26,181
or, in my case, a princess.

648
00:50:26,255 --> 00:50:28,883
When we were 10, they asked again.

649
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:33,827
We answered rock star, cowboy
or, in my case, a gold medalist.

650
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:38,561
But now that we've grown up,
they want a serious answer.

651
00:50:39,134 --> 00:50:41,125
Well, how about this?

652
00:50:41,904 --> 00:50:43,428
Who the hell knows?

653
00:50:44,707 --> 00:50:45,867
Yeah!

654
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:49,905
This isn't the time to make
hard-and-fast decisions.

655
00:50:49,979 --> 00:50:51,640
This is the time to make mistakes.

656
00:50:52,681 --> 00:50:55,650
Take the wrong train
and get stuck somewhere.

657
00:50:55,718 --> 00:50:58,380
Fall in love a lot.

658
00:50:59,788 --> 00:51:03,986
Major in philosophy, because there's
no way to make a career out of that.

659
00:51:04,059 --> 00:51:07,893
Change your mind, and change it again,
because nothing's permanent.

660
00:51:09,064 --> 00:51:11,624
So make as many mistakes as you can.

661
00:51:12,101 --> 00:51:14,797
That way, someday,
when they ask what we want to be,

662
00:51:15,271 --> 00:51:16,636
we won't have to guess.

663
00:51:18,107 --> 00:51:19,699
We'll know.

664
00:51:47,269 --> 00:51:48,566
You made it!

665
00:51:49,038 --> 00:51:51,529
Hey. What did you think of my speech?

666
00:51:51,607 --> 00:51:54,576
Too easy-breezy? Too self-helpful?
You hated it?

667
00:51:54,643 --> 00:51:57,237
- No. I think you pretty much nailed it.
- Yeah?

668
00:51:57,546 --> 00:51:59,844
It's like I was born to lead, right?

669
00:51:59,915 --> 00:52:01,678
I love this song! Let's go.

670
00:52:26,608 --> 00:52:27,939
What are you doing here?

671
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:30,275
You invited me, remember?

672
00:52:31,046 --> 00:52:34,982
Was my right hook too subtle for you?
That was me uninviting you.

673
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:39,379
Look, Bella, I'm sorry about, you know,

674
00:52:40,923 --> 00:52:43,391
the kiss and your hand.

675
00:52:44,293 --> 00:52:48,423
I'd blame it on the whole inner animal thing,
but it was really just me

676
00:52:49,064 --> 00:52:50,759
being an ass.

677
00:52:51,533 --> 00:52:52,966
I'm really sorry.

678
00:52:54,603 --> 00:52:56,434
I brought you something.

679
00:52:56,739 --> 00:53:00,004
A graduation present. I made it myself.

680
00:53:00,909 --> 00:53:02,342
Wow.

681
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:04,108
You made this?

682
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,672
It's really pretty.

683
00:53:06,949 --> 00:53:08,348
Thanks.

684
00:53:23,098 --> 00:53:24,156
I'll be right back.

685
00:53:27,236 --> 00:53:30,433
- Alice, what'd you see?
- The decision's been made.

686
00:53:30,506 --> 00:53:32,064
What's going on?

687
00:53:32,141 --> 00:53:34,632
- You're not going to Seattle.
- No.

688
00:53:35,811 --> 00:53:37,711
They're coming here.

689
00:53:38,313 --> 00:53:39,905
They'll be here in four days.

690
00:53:39,982 --> 00:53:41,882
This could turn into a bloodbath.

691
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,074
Who's behind it?

692
00:53:43,152 --> 00:53:45,620
I didn't see anyone I recognized.

693
00:53:46,221 --> 00:53:47,210
Maybe one.

694
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:51,791
I know his face. He's local. Riley Biers.

695
00:53:52,628 --> 00:53:53,652
He didn't start this.

696
00:53:53,729 --> 00:53:55,720
Whoever did is staying out of the action.

697
00:53:56,064 --> 00:53:58,430
They must be playing with the blind spots
in your vision.

698
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,468
Either way, the army is coming

699
00:54:00,536 --> 00:54:02,163
and there aren't enough of us
to protect the town.

700
00:54:02,237 --> 00:54:05,138
Hold up. What damn army?

701
00:54:05,207 --> 00:54:07,175
Newborns. Our kind.

702
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:08,535
What are they after?

703
00:54:08,777 --> 00:54:10,677
They were passing around Bella's scent.

704
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:12,376
A red blouse.

705
00:54:12,448 --> 00:54:15,815
They're after Bella?
What the hell does this mean?

706
00:54:15,884 --> 00:54:18,785
It means an ugly fight. With lives lost.

707
00:54:23,926 --> 00:54:26,121
All right. We're in.

708
00:54:26,562 --> 00:54:29,622
No. You'd get yourselves killed. No way.

709
00:54:30,165 --> 00:54:32,429
I wasn't asking for permission.

710
00:54:33,035 --> 00:54:34,434
Edward?

711
00:54:38,273 --> 00:54:39,763
It means more protection for you.

712
00:54:41,176 --> 00:54:45,840
Jacob, do you believe
Sam would agree to an understanding?

713
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:50,211
As long as we get to kill some vampires.

714
00:54:50,285 --> 00:54:51,309
Jasper?

715
00:54:51,386 --> 00:54:53,411
They'll give us the numbers.

716
00:54:54,623 --> 00:54:58,616
Newborns won't know they even exist.
That'll give us an edge.

717
00:54:58,694 --> 00:55:00,127
We'll need to coordinate.

718
00:55:00,195 --> 00:55:04,029
- Carlisle, they're gonna get hurt.
- We'll all need some training.

719
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:07,068
Fighting newborns requires knowledge
that Jasper has.

720
00:55:07,135 --> 00:55:09,228
You're welcome to join us.

721
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:13,666
All right. Name the time and place.

722
00:55:13,742 --> 00:55:17,576
Jake, you don't know
what you're getting yourself into.

723
00:55:19,014 --> 00:55:20,379
Bella,

724
00:55:20,983 --> 00:55:22,883
this is what we do.

725
00:55:23,418 --> 00:55:24,749
You should be happy.

726
00:55:25,387 --> 00:55:28,049
Look at us, working together.

727
00:55:28,524 --> 00:55:32,051
You are the one who wanted us
to get along. Remember?

728
00:55:41,603 --> 00:55:42,831
Again!

729
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:58,146
It's a graduation present.

730
00:56:17,306 --> 00:56:20,104
They don't trust us enough
to be in their human forms.

731
00:56:20,175 --> 00:56:22,302
They came. That's what matters.

732
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:25,342
Will you translate?

733
00:56:30,385 --> 00:56:31,682
Hey, Jake.

734
00:56:37,793 --> 00:56:39,192
Welcome.

735
00:56:41,396 --> 00:56:45,196
Jasper has experience with newborns.
He'll teach us how to defeat them.

736
00:56:48,637 --> 00:56:50,298
They want to know
how the newborns differ from us.

737
00:56:51,807 --> 00:56:53,399
They're a great deal stronger than us

738
00:56:53,475 --> 00:56:56,342
because their own human blood
lingers in their tissues.

739
00:56:57,112 --> 00:57:00,206
Our kind is never more physically powerful

740
00:57:00,682 --> 00:57:02,877
than in our first several months of this life.

741
00:57:06,421 --> 00:57:10,221
Carlisle's right. That's why they are created.

742
00:57:11,593 --> 00:57:15,495
A newborn army doesn't need thousands
like a human army,

743
00:57:16,098 --> 00:57:18,692
but no human army
could stand against them.

744
00:57:20,335 --> 00:57:23,429
Now, the two most important things
to remember are, first,

745
00:57:23,505 --> 00:57:26,941
never let them get their arms around you.
They'll crush you instantly.

746
00:57:27,009 --> 00:57:28,567
And second,

747
00:57:29,811 --> 00:57:32,575
never go for the obvious kill.

748
00:57:34,082 --> 00:57:36,312
They'll be expecting that,

749
00:57:36,918 --> 00:57:39,182
and you will lose.

750
00:57:40,756 --> 00:57:41,984
Emmett.

751
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:47,458
Even if they stick to humming

752
00:57:47,529 --> 00:57:49,053
Holding on a song to see them

753
00:57:49,131 --> 00:57:51,861
- Don't hold back.
- Not in my nature.

754
00:57:51,933 --> 00:57:53,958
Sick of, sick of, sick of love

755
00:57:56,138 --> 00:58:02,407
When you went down, the men came callin'

756
00:58:02,477 --> 00:58:06,709
Changing to stone as you wept from fallin'

757
00:58:06,782 --> 00:58:08,443
Never lose focus.

758
00:58:15,323 --> 00:58:19,157
When you went down, the men came callin'

759
00:58:21,363 --> 00:58:25,424
Changing to stone as you wept from fallin'

760
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:30,802
One more thing.

761
00:58:31,673 --> 00:58:34,233
Never turn your back on your enemy.

762
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:38,040
Singing in tones that makes things summer

763
00:58:45,787 --> 00:58:48,915
I got the skills

764
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:54,485
I'm in love with you

765
00:58:54,563 --> 00:58:58,465
Everything you taught me, honey

766
00:58:58,533 --> 00:59:00,660
It never even mattered really

767
00:59:00,736 --> 00:59:06,902
This song's about my love for you

768
00:59:21,523 --> 00:59:23,855
Some of you are gonna get hurt.

769
00:59:26,528 --> 00:59:29,656
Some of you could get killed
because of me.

770
00:59:33,068 --> 00:59:35,866
It's gonna be 100 times worse
than this, right?

771
00:59:58,527 --> 00:59:59,994
Done for the day.

772
01:00:13,175 --> 01:00:14,472
Jasper?

773
01:00:17,746 --> 01:00:20,544
Are you sure
there's nothing I can do to help?

774
01:00:20,615 --> 01:00:24,142
Well, your presence alone, your scent,
will distract the newborns.

775
01:00:24,219 --> 01:00:28,246
Their hunting instinct will take over
and drive them crazy.

776
01:00:29,758 --> 01:00:31,851
Good. I'm glad.

777
01:00:33,995 --> 01:00:37,362
Hey. How do you know so much about this?

778
01:00:39,367 --> 01:00:43,428
I didn't have quite the same upbringing
as my adopted siblings.

779
01:00:49,811 --> 01:00:53,076
- Those bites are like mine.
- Battle scars.

780
01:00:55,417 --> 01:00:58,079
All the training
the Confederate Army gave me

781
01:00:58,153 --> 01:01:00,621
was useless against the newborns.

782
01:01:01,389 --> 01:01:04,222
Still, I never lost a fight.

783
01:01:10,131 --> 01:01:13,157
This happened during the Civil War?

784
01:01:13,235 --> 01:01:15,965
I was the youngest major
in the Texas cavalry,

785
01:01:16,037 --> 01:01:18,733
all without having seen any real battle.

786
01:01:18,807 --> 01:01:19,967
Until?

787
01:01:21,977 --> 01:01:23,842
Till I met a certain immortal.

788
01:01:24,779 --> 01:01:26,246
Maria.

789
01:01:31,086 --> 01:01:32,383
I was riding back to Galveston

790
01:01:32,454 --> 01:01:35,082
after evacuating a column
of women and children

791
01:01:35,924 --> 01:01:37,118
when I saw them.

792
01:01:38,326 --> 01:01:40,089
I immediately offered them my aid.

793
01:01:48,103 --> 01:01:50,571
Lovely. And an officer.

794
01:01:58,146 --> 01:02:02,776
You'd better do it, Maria.
I can never stop once I've started.

795
01:02:06,321 --> 01:02:10,052
- What's your name, soldier?
- Major Jasper Whitlock, ma'am.

796
01:02:11,026 --> 01:02:12,789
I hope you survive.

797
01:02:13,895 --> 01:02:16,523
You may be of great use to me.

798
01:02:22,003 --> 01:02:23,834
- Maria was creating an army?
- They were very common in the South.

799
01:02:26,241 --> 01:02:29,404
There were constant brutal battles
for territory.

800
01:02:30,045 --> 01:02:31,774
Maria won them all.

801
01:02:32,981 --> 01:02:37,611
She was smart, careful, and she had me.

802
01:02:40,388 --> 01:02:42,686
I was her second in command.

803
01:02:43,258 --> 01:02:46,250
My ability to control emotions
served her well.

804
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,530
I trained her newborns,

805
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:57,697
an endless occupation since she never
let them live beyond their first year.

806
01:03:00,475 --> 01:03:02,943
It was my job to dispose of them.

807
01:03:23,531 --> 01:03:25,965
I could feel everything they felt.

808
01:03:38,913 --> 01:03:41,677
I thought what Maria and I had was love.

809
01:03:43,084 --> 01:03:46,815
But I was her puppet.
She pulled the strings.

810
01:03:48,957 --> 01:03:50,891
I didn't know there was another way

811
01:03:53,294 --> 01:03:55,091
till I found Alice.

812
01:03:56,898 --> 01:03:59,230
Now, she'd seen me coming, of course.

813
01:03:59,701 --> 01:04:01,794
You kept me waiting long enough.

814
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:07,435
My apologies, ma'am.

815
01:04:09,444 --> 01:04:11,742
I don't know what I'd have become
without her.

816
01:04:14,182 --> 01:04:16,582
You never have to be that again.

817
01:04:44,546 --> 01:04:45,604
Jasper.

818
01:04:46,981 --> 01:04:48,949
I want you to do something for me.

819
01:04:49,017 --> 01:04:51,315
Kill her.

820
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,926
What is it?

821
01:05:10,572 --> 01:05:12,096
The intruder,

822
01:05:13,741 --> 01:05:15,402
the newborn army,

823
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:19,977
they're all her puppets.

824
01:05:22,117 --> 01:05:23,345
Victoria.

825
01:05:24,552 --> 01:05:27,817
Alice would have seen
if she wanted to make an army.

826
01:05:27,889 --> 01:05:32,690
Unless she's hiding behind them
and she's letting someone else decide.

827
01:06:01,956 --> 01:06:03,821
Welcome to the army.

828
01:06:13,101 --> 01:06:16,798
I'm not just gonna hide
while you're out taking all the risks for me.

829
01:06:17,605 --> 01:06:21,006
If it's Victoria involved, I need to keep you
as far away from the fight as possible.

830
01:06:21,075 --> 01:06:24,533
- Jasper said that I could be of help.
- We won't need your help.

831
01:06:24,612 --> 01:06:27,445
With the wolves in this, it's an easy win.

832
01:06:27,515 --> 01:06:30,143
The rest of us
aren't gonna have enough to do.

833
01:06:30,218 --> 01:06:32,584
Okay.
Either it's so dangerous that I have to hide

834
01:06:32,654 --> 01:06:34,679
or it's so easy
that you're gonna be sidelined. Which is it?

835
01:06:34,756 --> 01:06:37,247
It's dangerous for you, it's easy for us.

836
01:06:39,194 --> 01:06:43,858
I think it's dangerous for us to be apart.
How many times do we have to prove that?

837
01:06:44,899 --> 01:06:49,632
I'll be worried. You'll be worried.
And we'll both be more vulnerable.

838
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,969
Okay, you're right.

839
01:06:54,676 --> 01:06:58,237
- So I'm coming with you.
- No, we both stay away together.

840
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,547
I can't make you choose
between me and your family.

841
01:07:01,616 --> 01:07:04,642
The only way I can protect you
is to be with you.

842
01:07:08,856 --> 01:07:12,917
You're not fighting?
What, did you pull a muscle or something?

843
01:07:12,994 --> 01:07:15,394
- He's doing it for me, okay?
- Whatever.

844
01:07:16,764 --> 01:07:17,992
Just tell me the plan.

845
01:07:18,933 --> 01:07:20,901
This field will give us
an advantage in battle.

846
01:07:20,969 --> 01:07:23,767
We need to lure the newborns
with Bella's scent,

847
01:07:24,505 --> 01:07:26,268
but it needs to end here.

848
01:07:26,341 --> 01:07:27,968
Edward and I are going to a campsite.

849
01:07:28,042 --> 01:07:31,375
Even if he carries me,
they'll still pick up on our scents.

850
01:07:31,446 --> 01:07:33,414
Your stench, however, is revolting.

851
01:07:33,481 --> 01:07:35,608
Dude, you really
don't wanna start comparing stinks.

852
01:07:35,683 --> 01:07:39,278
What he means is that your scent
will mask mine if you carry me.

853
01:07:40,154 --> 01:07:43,180
- Done.
- This is not a good idea.

854
01:07:43,258 --> 01:07:48,252
Edward, they won't want
to get anywhere near his odor.

855
01:07:48,529 --> 01:07:50,520
Okay. Let's just try it.

856
01:07:53,301 --> 01:07:55,667
- Eau de wolf coming up.
- Run.

857
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:08,540
So you gonna ask me
to sit out of the fight, too?

858
01:08:08,616 --> 01:08:10,743
Or don't you care about my safety?

859
01:08:11,219 --> 01:08:16,657
- Of course, I care. But you'd say no.
- I won't have a choice, anyways.

860
01:08:17,892 --> 01:08:22,192
Since I let Sam be alpha male,
I gotta live with the shots he calls.

861
01:08:23,431 --> 01:08:25,331
Since you let Sam be alpha?

862
01:08:26,601 --> 01:08:30,401
I didn't wanna be in a pack,
let alone be its leader.

863
01:08:32,273 --> 01:08:33,365
Wow.

864
01:08:34,876 --> 01:08:37,845
- Chief Jacob.
- Opted out.

865
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:41,278
But every choice has its consequences.

866
01:08:41,849 --> 01:08:44,409
- Some more than others.
- Don't start.

867
01:08:44,919 --> 01:08:47,888
Everybody makes choices.
You're gonna have to accept mine.

868
01:08:47,955 --> 01:08:51,356
But you can love
more than one person at a time.

869
01:08:51,426 --> 01:08:55,055
I've seen it. With Sam, Emily and Leah.

870
01:08:56,597 --> 01:09:01,534
- Well, I'm not a wolf. I can't imprint.
- It has nothing to do with imprinting.

871
01:09:02,704 --> 01:09:06,333
It has to do with feeling something
for somebody.

872
01:09:06,974 --> 01:09:09,602
And I know you feel something for me.

873
01:09:10,812 --> 01:09:13,940
I can sense how I make you feel, physically.

874
01:09:15,817 --> 01:09:17,580
I make you nervous.

875
01:09:21,889 --> 01:09:23,117
Jake.

876
01:09:25,193 --> 01:09:26,626
Don't worry.

877
01:09:27,562 --> 01:09:30,929
I promised I wouldn't kiss you again
till you asked.

878
01:09:31,566 --> 01:09:35,161
You're gonna be keeping that promise
for a while, chief.

879
01:09:38,172 --> 01:09:41,699
All I picked up was wolf stench. No Bella.

880
01:09:44,946 --> 01:09:47,380
- This will work.
- Great.

881
01:09:55,456 --> 01:09:57,151
Yes. Scout's honor.

882
01:09:57,925 --> 01:10:00,826
- Okay, Alice, don't be a stranger.
- Okay.

883
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:05,522
- Your alibi for the battle is all arranged.
- Really?

884
01:10:06,033 --> 01:10:08,729
I told your father that our whole family's
going camping this weekend,

885
01:10:08,803 --> 01:10:11,237
so you and I are having a sleepover
at my house.

886
01:10:12,507 --> 01:10:15,340
- Charlie's going fishing, anyway.
- Charlie?

887
01:10:15,877 --> 01:10:19,313
- You guys are on first name basis now?
- Me, he likes.

888
01:10:20,882 --> 01:10:24,113
Actually, you and Edward
will have the house to yourself tonight.

889
01:10:27,688 --> 01:10:28,746
Like alone?

890
01:10:29,524 --> 01:10:33,016
We're all going hunting.
Powering up for the battle.

891
01:10:35,763 --> 01:10:36,855
You're welcome.

892
01:10:39,066 --> 01:10:42,832
- Hey. You want a sandwich?
- No, I'm good.

893
01:10:44,906 --> 01:10:46,897
Well, the sister, I like.

894
01:10:48,075 --> 01:10:50,976
Alice. Yeah, she's great.

895
01:10:58,953 --> 01:11:00,921
Hey, Dad, I was wondering.

896
01:11:02,457 --> 01:11:05,517
Why didn't you get remarried? After Mom.

897
01:11:09,964 --> 01:11:14,697
I don't know.
Guess I still haven't met the right gal.

898
01:11:17,104 --> 01:11:19,197
- Why?
- I don't know.

899
01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:26,537
I thought you just maybe gave up
on the whole institution of it,

900
01:11:27,682 --> 01:11:29,115
of marriage.

901
01:11:30,918 --> 01:11:32,545
But do you think there's any value in it?

902
01:11:34,822 --> 01:11:37,848
Yeah. Yeah, marriage has value.

903
01:11:39,927 --> 01:11:41,519
When you're older.

904
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:43,792
Much older.

905
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,592
Like your mother.

906
01:11:48,002 --> 01:11:50,402
It seemed to work out fine for her
the second time around,

907
01:11:50,471 --> 01:11:53,372
- later in life.
- Yeah, I guess.

908
01:11:55,977 --> 01:12:00,311
I mean, you definitely don't wanna
have to get married because you weren't

909
01:12:01,382 --> 01:12:02,781
careful.

910
01:12:04,752 --> 01:12:08,188
- What?
- Look, you know what I'm talking about.

911
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:12,821
There's things you need to think about
if you're gonna be physically intimate.

912
01:12:12,894 --> 01:12:15,488
Okay. Don't have "the talk" with me, please.

913
01:12:15,563 --> 01:12:18,123
Well, it's just as embarrassing for me
as it is for you.

914
01:12:18,199 --> 01:12:19,564
I doubt that.

915
01:12:19,634 --> 01:12:22,068
And don't bother,
'cause Mom beat you to it like 10 years ago.

916
01:12:22,136 --> 01:12:24,036
Well, you didn't have a boyfriend
10 years ago.

917
01:12:24,105 --> 01:12:26,505
I'm sure things work the same way.

918
01:12:28,843 --> 01:12:30,538
All right, so...

919
01:12:32,446 --> 01:12:34,880
You guys are taking precautions and...

920
01:12:34,949 --> 01:12:37,918
Okay, Dad, please,
just don't worry about that.

921
01:12:38,986 --> 01:12:42,012
Edward is old school.

922
01:12:44,358 --> 01:12:47,953
Old school. Great. What's that?
Like, code for something?

923
01:12:48,029 --> 01:12:50,691
Oh, my God. Dad. I'm a virgin.

924
01:12:51,699 --> 01:12:55,260
- Okay! Good. Glad we covered that.
- Me, too.

925
01:12:59,807 --> 01:13:01,138
Virgin.

926
01:13:02,743 --> 01:13:05,041
I'm liking Edward a little bit more now.

927
01:13:15,923 --> 01:13:18,153
What are you doing outside?
What's wrong?

928
01:13:19,427 --> 01:13:20,655
Nothing.

929
01:13:40,448 --> 01:13:43,246
It seems only fair
that I be represented, as well.

930
01:13:47,855 --> 01:13:49,686
It's really pretty.

931
01:13:50,891 --> 01:13:51,949
Thanks.

932
01:14:00,334 --> 01:14:01,824
There's a bed.

933
01:14:03,137 --> 01:14:05,571
I thought you might need one to sleep in.

934
01:14:07,908 --> 01:14:10,502
I think an air mattress would have sufficed.

935
01:14:10,578 --> 01:14:13,479
- Is this too much?
- No.

936
01:14:14,649 --> 01:14:16,344
No, it's perfect.

937
01:14:17,952 --> 01:14:21,388
- I wanna ask you something.
- Anything.

938
01:14:25,626 --> 01:14:28,959
Okay, marriage is the condition for you
to change me yourself, right?

939
01:14:31,866 --> 01:14:32,958
Yes.

940
01:14:35,936 --> 01:14:38,996
Okay. I wanna negotiate my own condition.

941
01:14:41,108 --> 01:14:43,440
Anything you want. It's yours.

942
01:14:45,479 --> 01:14:47,106
You promise?

943
01:14:48,549 --> 01:14:49,743
Yeah.

944
01:14:53,754 --> 01:14:55,085
Okay.

945
01:15:01,629 --> 01:15:02,687
Hey.

946
01:15:11,505 --> 01:15:12,802
Bella.

947
01:15:13,874 --> 01:15:15,068
No.

948
01:15:15,142 --> 01:15:17,440
But you said that you wanted me
to have every human experience.

949
01:15:17,511 --> 01:15:20,674
- Not ones that will risk killing you.
- You won't.

950
01:15:22,883 --> 01:15:25,977
And everyone says once I'm changed
all I'll want is to slaughter the whole town.

951
01:15:27,354 --> 01:15:30,448
- That part doesn't last forever.
- I want you.

952
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:37,092
While I'm still me.
While I still want you this way.

953
01:15:41,836 --> 01:15:46,830
- It's too dangerous.
- Try. Just try.

954
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:54,113
I'll go to some ridiculously expensive
college and let you buy me a car.

955
01:15:54,181 --> 01:15:56,411
I'll marry you. Just try.

956
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,621
You were searching

957
01:16:03,524 --> 01:16:07,358
For release

958
01:16:08,062 --> 01:16:11,498
You took my hand

959
01:16:11,899 --> 01:16:15,562
Added a plan

960
01:16:15,636 --> 01:16:19,800
You gave me your heart

961
01:16:26,714 --> 01:16:33,643
I know you're pleased to go

962
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:40,283
Stop trying to take your clothes off.

963
01:16:40,361 --> 01:16:43,023
- You wanna do that part?
- Not tonight.

964
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:04,577
You...

965
01:17:08,088 --> 01:17:10,022
You mean, you don't...

966
01:17:11,992 --> 01:17:13,084
That's fine.

967
01:17:16,497 --> 01:17:18,624
Believe me, I want to.

968
01:17:20,801 --> 01:17:22,735
I just want to be married to you first.

969
01:17:26,106 --> 01:17:28,404
You really make me feel
like I'm some sort of villain

970
01:17:28,475 --> 01:17:31,569
trying to steal your virtue or something.

971
01:17:33,981 --> 01:17:36,176
It's not my virtue I'm concerned about.

972
01:17:38,586 --> 01:17:40,247
Are you kidding?

973
01:17:40,821 --> 01:17:44,848
It's just one rule I wanna leave unbroken.

974
01:17:47,194 --> 01:17:50,925
It might be too late for my soul,
but I will protect yours.

975
01:17:52,099 --> 01:17:54,795
I know that's not a modern notion.

976
01:17:54,869 --> 01:17:58,032
It's not modern. It's ancient.

977
01:18:01,141 --> 01:18:03,200
I'm from a different era.

978
01:18:05,546 --> 01:18:09,073
Things were a lot less complicated.

979
01:18:11,318 --> 01:18:15,778
And if I'd have met you back then,
I would have courted you.

980
01:18:17,992 --> 01:18:23,157
We'd have taken chaperoned strolls
and iced tea on the porch.

981
01:18:33,974 --> 01:18:36,340
I may have stolen a kiss or two,

982
01:18:37,444 --> 01:18:42,381
but only after asking
your father's permission.

983
01:18:44,685 --> 01:18:46,243
I would have got down on one knee,

984
01:18:53,127 --> 01:18:56,096
and I would have
presented you with a ring.

985
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:04,262
This was my mother's.

986
01:19:08,542 --> 01:19:13,502
Isabella Swan, I promise to love you
every moment of forever.

987
01:19:14,682 --> 01:19:18,345
And would you do me
the extraordinary honor of marrying me?

988
01:19:24,224 --> 01:19:25,589
Yes.

989
01:19:47,448 --> 01:19:49,541
You're not coming with us?

990
01:19:58,125 --> 01:20:00,616
It'll be a last minute decision.

991
01:20:02,629 --> 01:20:07,862
- I told you how it works.
- The Cullens have powers.

992
01:20:09,069 --> 01:20:13,768
Don't underestimate them, Riley.
You'll have the numbers,

993
01:20:14,742 --> 01:20:19,941
but they'll be able
to anticipate your every move.

994
01:20:21,348 --> 01:20:24,112
- According to your friend?
- Yes.

995
01:20:24,718 --> 01:20:27,585
My dead friend.

996
01:20:30,357 --> 01:20:33,622
Laurent found out about the things
they could do,

997
01:20:35,629 --> 01:20:37,460
and they killed him.

998
01:20:39,333 --> 01:20:41,528
But not before he told me.

999
01:20:46,673 --> 01:20:48,504
Maybe he was wrong.

1000
01:20:51,578 --> 01:20:58,074
I mean, this is supposed to be
Cullen territory.

1001
01:20:59,186 --> 01:21:03,122
We've been tearing it up
and I've never even seen them here.

1002
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:05,921
You don't trust me.

1003
01:21:07,127 --> 01:21:11,655
- With my life. I'm just saying...
- I'm doing this for us.

1004
01:21:11,732 --> 01:21:16,795
So that we can feed
without their retaliation.

1005
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:20,636
I can't live in fear anymore,
waiting for them to attack.

1006
01:21:20,707 --> 01:21:22,402
I won't let them.

1007
01:21:23,577 --> 01:21:28,344
I am going to end the Cullen clan.

1008
01:21:31,218 --> 01:21:32,617
I swear.

1009
01:21:49,803 --> 01:21:53,136
I love you so much.

1010
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,159
You're going overboard.

1011
01:22:15,762 --> 01:22:18,322
If this is all I can contribute,
I wanna be thorough.

1012
01:22:18,398 --> 01:22:20,628
The newborns'll be frantic.

1013
01:22:22,836 --> 01:22:26,237
It's okay.
Don't make yourself uncomfortable.

1014
01:22:26,306 --> 01:22:27,637
It doesn't bother me anymore.

1015
01:22:29,743 --> 01:22:30,937
Since when?

1016
01:22:31,411 --> 01:22:34,437
Since I spent 24 hours
thinking you were dead.

1017
01:22:36,083 --> 01:22:38,313
You're not wearing your ring.

1018
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:42,186
Well, I didn't want to risk losing it.

1019
01:22:44,057 --> 01:22:45,547
Or risk Jacob seeing it.

1020
01:22:48,795 --> 01:22:52,697
I think we should wait to tell him.
I mean, at least till after the fight.

1021
01:22:52,766 --> 01:22:55,394
- If you're having second thoughts...
- I'm not.

1022
01:22:55,469 --> 01:22:59,565
- I just want him to have a clear head.
- Whose head is unclear?

1023
01:23:01,108 --> 01:23:02,803
Nobody's I hope.

1024
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:06,779
- Alice says there's a storm coming.
- Yeah, I can feel it.

1025
01:23:08,015 --> 01:23:09,812
We should get going.

1026
01:23:10,951 --> 01:23:13,419
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

1027
01:23:22,696 --> 01:23:24,163
Something up?

1028
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:30,797
- Bunch of vampires trying to kill me.
- Same old same old.

1029
01:24:48,782 --> 01:24:49,874
Thank you.

1030
01:24:52,452 --> 01:24:55,512
- You should get back before the storm hits.
- No, I'm staying.

1031
01:24:56,256 --> 01:24:58,986
You'll need my connection to the pack
to keep tabs on what's going on.

1032
01:24:59,059 --> 01:25:02,586
- You're not gonna fight?
- Seth will spell me in the morning.

1033
01:25:02,963 --> 01:25:05,898
He's not happy about missing the action
but it'll keep him out of trouble.

1034
01:25:07,668 --> 01:25:09,226
Let's get you inside.

1035
01:25:27,421 --> 01:25:32,586
- I should have chosen a site lower down.
- No, it's fine. I'm okay.

1036
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:34,852
What can I do?

1037
01:25:47,607 --> 01:25:50,906
I can't sleep
with all that teeth chattering going on.

1038
01:25:58,185 --> 01:26:02,417
- Forget it.
- She may need her toes someday.

1039
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:07,023
And let's face it, I am hotter than you.

1040
01:26:12,099 --> 01:26:16,968
- Get your hand off me.
- Keep your hands off her.

1041
01:26:17,471 --> 01:26:18,961
Don't fight.

1042
01:26:22,342 --> 01:26:24,139
If she gets sick, it's on you.

1043
01:26:41,194 --> 01:26:43,389
Wow, you're freezing, Bella.

1044
01:26:44,498 --> 01:26:47,956
Relax. You'll warm up soon.

1045
01:26:49,536 --> 01:26:52,096
Faster if you took your clothes off.

1046
01:26:52,172 --> 01:26:54,834
- Jake.
- Survival 101.

1047
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:29,771
Can you at least attempt
to control your thoughts?

1048
01:27:32,179 --> 01:27:35,774
I really get under
that ice-cold skin of yours, don't I?

1049
01:27:38,118 --> 01:27:39,244
What?

1050
01:27:40,287 --> 01:27:42,949
Are you doubting her feelings for you?

1051
01:27:45,625 --> 01:27:46,717
Nice.

1052
01:27:47,861 --> 01:27:53,197
So picking through my brain's okay,
but letting me into yours, forget it.

1053
01:27:57,204 --> 01:27:58,364
Look.

1054
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:02,807
- I know she's in love with you.
- Good.

1055
01:28:03,477 --> 01:28:05,809
But she's in love with me, too.

1056
01:28:08,048 --> 01:28:10,573
She just won't admit it to herself.

1057
01:28:13,587 --> 01:28:16,021
I can't tell if you're right.

1058
01:28:17,491 --> 01:28:19,015
Then let me ask you something.

1059
01:28:20,093 --> 01:28:22,823
- If she chooses me...
- She won't.

1060
01:28:23,396 --> 01:28:24,727
If she did,

1061
01:28:26,466 --> 01:28:27,865
would you try to kill me?

1062
01:28:29,503 --> 01:28:31,596
That's an intriguing idea.

1063
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:39,638
But, no. I couldn't hurt her like that.

1064
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:43,544
So you'd just turn her into
a blood-sucking demon like you?

1065
01:28:44,351 --> 01:28:47,252
I don't want that. I never wanted that.

1066
01:28:47,687 --> 01:28:50,212
- So stop her.
- I tried.

1067
01:28:52,025 --> 01:28:54,755
- I left.
- But you gave up too quickly.

1068
01:28:56,696 --> 01:29:01,599
If you'd stayed away another 6 months,
I could've made her happy.

1069
01:29:02,369 --> 01:29:03,700
Trust me.

1070
01:29:05,205 --> 01:29:10,040
You have to consider
that I might be better for her than you are.

1071
01:29:12,712 --> 01:29:14,646
I have considered that.

1072
01:29:18,351 --> 01:29:20,512
I know you can protect her.

1073
01:29:23,156 --> 01:29:27,991
But you can give her a life, a human life.
That's all I want for her.

1074
01:29:31,164 --> 01:29:32,222
But I'm not...

1075
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:36,565
I'm not going to force her into anything
ever again.

1076
01:29:39,005 --> 01:29:42,338
The last time I tried,
it almost killed us both.

1077
01:29:44,678 --> 01:29:47,078
Yeah. That I remember.

1078
01:29:51,318 --> 01:29:53,582
When you thought she was gone,

1079
01:29:55,922 --> 01:29:57,685
that you'd lost her,

1080
01:30:00,193 --> 01:30:03,094
how did you cope?

1081
01:30:05,098 --> 01:30:06,895
There are no words.

1082
01:30:12,939 --> 01:30:15,373
But I wouldn't wish it on anyone, Jacob.

1083
01:30:18,111 --> 01:30:21,638
This might sound odd,
but I'm glad you're here.

1084
01:30:22,515 --> 01:30:23,812
Meaning,

1085
01:30:24,851 --> 01:30:27,820
"As much as I'd love to kill you,
I'm glad she's warm."

1086
01:30:30,957 --> 01:30:33,255
If we weren't natural enemies

1087
01:30:33,793 --> 01:30:36,728
and you weren't trying to
steal my reason for existing,

1088
01:30:38,098 --> 01:30:40,225
I might actually like you.

1089
01:30:41,267 --> 01:30:42,564
Well,

1090
01:30:44,137 --> 01:30:48,335
if you weren't planning on sucking the life
out of the girl I love,

1091
01:30:49,242 --> 01:30:50,573
I might...

1092
01:30:57,651 --> 01:31:00,711
No. Not even then.

1093
01:31:09,062 --> 01:31:12,361
But she could still change her mind,
you know.

1094
01:31:19,139 --> 01:31:20,504
Then I'd let her go.

1095
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:42,252
Right. Hey, Seth.

1096
01:31:45,465 --> 01:31:48,400
- Where's Jacob? Did he already...
- Not yet.

1097
01:31:50,270 --> 01:31:54,036
He's checking to see if the woods are clear
before he goes.

1098
01:32:01,147 --> 01:32:04,708
I'm really sorry about last night.
That couldn't have been easy on you.

1099
01:32:05,151 --> 01:32:08,143
It definitely won't make my list
of top 10 favorite evenings.

1100
01:32:09,222 --> 01:32:13,352
- You have a list?
- All 10 I spent with you.

1101
01:32:14,794 --> 01:32:19,163
Number one is when you said
you'd marry me, Mrs. Cullen.

1102
01:32:23,002 --> 01:32:26,904
This is the 21st century.
I at least want to hyphenate my name.

1103
01:32:27,741 --> 01:32:31,199
- You're marrying him?
- Jake, I...

1104
01:32:35,582 --> 01:32:39,040
- You knew he was listening!
- He deserves to know.

1105
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:41,978
- Jake, stop!
- Bella, let him...

1106
01:32:42,088 --> 01:32:43,214
Don't!

1107
01:32:46,292 --> 01:32:47,350
Jake, stop!

1108
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:54,488
- Jake, please!
- I'm done! I'm so done!

1109
01:32:55,735 --> 01:32:56,963
What can I do?

1110
01:32:57,036 --> 01:33:01,234
You can't do anything. I can,
by going out there and killing something.

1111
01:33:01,307 --> 01:33:03,901
No! You're not thinking clearly!
Don't do that!

1112
01:33:04,110 --> 01:33:06,772
Maybe I'll get myself killed
and make it simple for you.

1113
01:33:06,846 --> 01:33:09,280
No! Just, Jake, stay.

1114
01:33:11,184 --> 01:33:12,378
Why?

1115
01:33:14,254 --> 01:33:15,949
Give me one good reason.

1116
01:33:17,090 --> 01:33:19,024
Because I don't wanna lose you.

1117
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:22,025
It's not good enough.

1118
01:33:23,429 --> 01:33:25,294
Because you're too important.

1119
01:33:28,735 --> 01:33:32,227
- Still not good enough.
- Jacob!

1120
01:33:36,476 --> 01:33:37,738
Kiss me.

1121
01:33:41,114 --> 01:33:44,572
I'm asking you to kiss me.

1122
01:34:32,365 --> 01:34:34,993
That should have been our first kiss.

1123
01:34:40,607 --> 01:34:42,006
I gotta go.

1124
01:34:44,944 --> 01:34:46,343
I'll be back.

1125
01:35:16,576 --> 01:35:19,977
- You saw.
- No, but...

1126
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:22,743
Jacob's thoughts are pretty loud.

1127
01:35:24,284 --> 01:35:25,808
I don't know what happened.

1128
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:29,253
You love him.

1129
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:35,457
I love you more.

1130
01:35:37,196 --> 01:35:38,561
I know.

1131
01:35:53,246 --> 01:35:54,975
It's starting.

1132
01:36:54,907 --> 01:36:56,135
Jacob just got there.

1133
01:37:02,582 --> 01:37:04,106
He's good.

1134
01:38:02,408 --> 01:38:03,534
Someone's hurt?

1135
01:38:04,944 --> 01:38:07,970
She's close. I can hear her thoughts.

1136
01:38:08,381 --> 01:38:09,609
Seth, go.

1137
01:38:14,587 --> 01:38:16,953
She knew we weren't there,
but she caught my scent.

1138
01:38:17,423 --> 01:38:19,516
She knew you'd be with me.

1139
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:21,626
She found us.

1140
01:38:25,231 --> 01:38:26,892
She's not alone.

1141
01:38:36,042 --> 01:38:38,840
Riley, listen to me.

1142
01:38:40,279 --> 01:38:43,339
Victoria's just using you to distract me.

1143
01:38:44,117 --> 01:38:45,584
She knows I'll kill you.

1144
01:38:49,255 --> 01:38:53,021
In fact, she'll be glad
she doesn't have to deal with you anymore.

1145
01:38:53,693 --> 01:38:58,062
Don't listen, Riley.
I told you about their mind tricks.

1146
01:38:58,131 --> 01:39:01,965
I can read her mind.
So I know what she thinks of you.

1147
01:39:02,468 --> 01:39:04,129
He's lying.

1148
01:39:04,203 --> 01:39:08,867
She only created you and this army
to avenge her true mate, James.

1149
01:39:10,042 --> 01:39:13,170
That's the only thing she cares about.
Not you.

1150
01:39:15,815 --> 01:39:19,273
There's only you. You know that.

1151
01:39:21,687 --> 01:39:25,350
Think about it. You're from Forks.

1152
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:28,420
You know the area.

1153
01:39:29,529 --> 01:39:31,394
That's the only reason she chose you.

1154
01:39:33,099 --> 01:39:35,329
She doesn't love you.

1155
01:39:35,401 --> 01:39:40,395
Riley. Don't let him do this to us.

1156
01:39:42,842 --> 01:39:44,309
You know I love you.

1157
01:39:58,491 --> 01:39:59,890
You're dead.

1158
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:16,940
You won't get another chance
like this again.

1159
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:22,770
You want her.

1160
01:40:24,584 --> 01:40:27,815
You want me to feel the pain you felt
when I killed James,

1161
01:40:29,956 --> 01:40:32,618
when I tore him to pieces,

1162
01:40:35,127 --> 01:40:37,823
when I turned him into ash,

1163
01:40:39,999 --> 01:40:43,958
when I turned him into nothing.

1164
01:42:04,083 --> 01:42:05,243
Victoria!

1165
01:42:06,686 --> 01:42:07,880
Victoria!

1166
01:42:08,754 --> 01:42:10,346
Victoria!

1167
01:43:04,477 --> 01:43:07,412
- Something is wrong.
- Alice needs us to go.

1168
01:43:08,347 --> 01:43:09,439
Now.

1169
01:43:32,471 --> 01:43:35,531
- How long?
- A few minutes. Maybe 10?

1170
01:43:35,608 --> 01:43:36,973
The pack needs to leave.

1171
01:43:37,042 --> 01:43:39,533
The Volturi won't honor
a truce with the werewolves.

1172
01:43:46,519 --> 01:43:47,577
Leah, don't!

1173
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:06,565
Jacob!

1174
01:44:09,942 --> 01:44:12,502
Jacob. Hold on.
Carlisle's gonna take care of you.

1175
01:44:12,578 --> 01:44:14,739
The bones on the right half of his body
are shattered.

1176
01:44:16,482 --> 01:44:18,848
- Bella.
- Jake, I'm right here.

1177
01:44:20,853 --> 01:44:23,117
- Jacob, you idiot, I had it!
- Leah!

1178
01:44:23,189 --> 01:44:25,851
I need to set the bones
before his accelerated healing kicks in.

1179
01:44:25,925 --> 01:44:28,223
- It's already starting.
- We need to get him out of here.

1180
01:44:28,294 --> 01:44:31,161
We're not gonna win a fight
with the Volturi.

1181
01:44:31,230 --> 01:44:33,960
- We'll take him back to Billy's.
- I'll be there soon as I can.

1182
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:35,558
Hang in there, Jake.

1183
01:44:46,312 --> 01:44:49,076
- It's okay. We got you.
- We got you.

1184
01:44:50,049 --> 01:44:51,175
They're coming.

1185
01:45:12,738 --> 01:45:14,000
Impressive.

1186
01:45:14,073 --> 01:45:18,635
I've never seen a coven escape
an assault of this magnitude intact.

1187
01:45:18,711 --> 01:45:20,269
We were lucky.

1188
01:45:21,747 --> 01:45:23,339
I doubt that.

1189
01:45:25,251 --> 01:45:28,709
- It appears we missed an entertaining fight.
- Yes.

1190
01:45:29,455 --> 01:45:32,117
It's not often we're rendered unnecessary.

1191
01:45:32,191 --> 01:45:34,989
If you'd arrived a half hour ago,
you would have fulfilled your purpose.

1192
01:45:36,662 --> 01:45:37,822
Pity.

1193
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:43,058
You missed one.

1194
01:45:50,109 --> 01:45:52,543
We offered her asylum
in exchange for her surrender.

1195
01:45:53,846 --> 01:45:55,609
That wasn't yours to offer.

1196
01:45:58,751 --> 01:45:59,877
Why did you come?

1197
01:46:06,225 --> 01:46:07,453
Who created you?

1198
01:46:09,295 --> 01:46:11,855
You don't need to do that.
She'll tell you anything you want to know.

1199
01:46:12,765 --> 01:46:14,027
I know.

1200
01:46:16,135 --> 01:46:20,003
I don't know! Riley wouldn't tell us.

1201
01:46:21,106 --> 01:46:23,165
He said our thoughts weren't safe.

1202
01:46:23,242 --> 01:46:26,507
Her name was Victoria.
Perhaps you knew her.

1203
01:46:27,413 --> 01:46:30,678
Edward,
if the Volturi had knowledge of Victoria,

1204
01:46:30,749 --> 01:46:31,738
they would have stopped her.

1205
01:46:33,285 --> 01:46:34,582
Isn't that right, Jane?

1206
01:46:36,989 --> 01:46:38,479
Of course.

1207
01:46:39,959 --> 01:46:41,017
Felix.

1208
01:46:42,328 --> 01:46:43,761
She didn't know what she was doing.

1209
01:46:45,698 --> 01:46:48,030
We'll take responsibility for her.

1210
01:46:48,601 --> 01:46:50,228
Give her a chance.

1211
01:46:53,038 --> 01:46:58,237
The Volturi don't give second chances.
Keep that in mind.

1212
01:46:59,511 --> 01:47:02,378
Caius will be interested to know
that she's still human.

1213
01:47:02,748 --> 01:47:04,841
The date is set.

1214
01:47:07,219 --> 01:47:10,882
Take care of that, Felix. I'd like to go home.

1215
01:47:39,118 --> 01:47:40,608
Hey.

1216
01:47:46,392 --> 01:47:49,884
- It's been going on for a while.
- Doc's re-breaking his bones.

1217
01:47:49,962 --> 01:47:51,793
Why did he have to butt in?
I could've taken that tick.

1218
01:47:51,864 --> 01:47:53,388
Give it a rest, Leah.

1219
01:47:59,972 --> 01:48:01,803
The worst is over. He'll be all right.

1220
01:48:02,841 --> 01:48:04,001
I gave him some morphine,

1221
01:48:04,076 --> 01:48:06,408
but his body temperature
will burn it off soon.

1222
01:48:06,478 --> 01:48:08,537
I'll come back to set up a drip.

1223
01:48:09,081 --> 01:48:10,514
Thank you.

1224
01:48:20,459 --> 01:48:21,653
He's asking for you.

1225
01:48:36,975 --> 01:48:38,033
Hey, Jake.

1226
01:48:41,613 --> 01:48:42,875
Hey.

1227
01:48:55,761 --> 01:48:59,561
- I was worried about you.
- You were worried about me?

1228
01:49:01,333 --> 01:49:02,925
Yeah.

1229
01:49:03,936 --> 01:49:06,734
I guessed Edward would read my thoughts.

1230
01:49:09,408 --> 01:49:12,866
- Was he hard on you?
- He wasn't even mad at me.

1231
01:49:14,113 --> 01:49:15,273
Or you.

1232
01:49:16,782 --> 01:49:18,272
Well, damn.

1233
01:49:20,786 --> 01:49:24,745
- He's better than I thought.
- He's not playing a game.

1234
01:49:27,292 --> 01:49:28,554
Right.

1235
01:49:32,097 --> 01:49:33,394
Bella.

1236
01:49:36,702 --> 01:49:39,535
He's not as perfect as you think.

1237
01:49:43,075 --> 01:49:44,770
I know who he is.

1238
01:49:49,114 --> 01:49:51,514
Can we just not talk about that?

1239
01:49:52,718 --> 01:49:55,778
I'd rather get all the re-breaking done
at once.

1240
01:50:01,894 --> 01:50:04,727
Well, at least I know
I did everything I could.

1241
01:50:08,567 --> 01:50:11,900
It wasn't easy making you admit
your feelings for me.

1242
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:18,366
I only fought them because I knew
they wouldn't change anything.

1243
01:50:26,585 --> 01:50:29,520
I'm exactly right for you, Bella.

1244
01:50:32,024 --> 01:50:36,688
It would be as easy as breathing, with me.

1245
01:50:42,701 --> 01:50:44,999
You know I love you.

1246
01:50:51,777 --> 01:50:54,678
You know how much I wish it was enough.

1247
01:51:06,558 --> 01:51:07,718
Should I come back?

1248
01:51:10,929 --> 01:51:12,624
I need some time.

1249
01:51:17,336 --> 01:51:19,429
But I'll always be waiting.

1250
01:51:24,676 --> 01:51:27,474
Until my heart stops beating.

1251
01:51:29,448 --> 01:51:30,779
Maybe even then.

1252
01:51:53,872 --> 01:51:58,172
- August 13th?
- Yeah. It's a month before my birthday.

1253
01:51:58,777 --> 01:52:01,871
I don't need to be
another year older than you.

1254
01:52:02,681 --> 01:52:04,478
Alice said she could get the wedding
together by then.

1255
01:52:05,584 --> 01:52:07,279
I'm sure she can.

1256
01:52:09,655 --> 01:52:11,316
There's no rush.

1257
01:52:13,892 --> 01:52:17,089
I've chosen my life.
I want to start living it.

1258
01:52:18,063 --> 01:52:21,521
And so you're gonna let Alice
plan the whole thing?

1259
01:52:21,867 --> 01:52:26,361
The dress, the reception, the guest list.

1260
01:52:26,438 --> 01:52:29,236
I mean, who knows who she's gonna invite?

1261
01:52:31,243 --> 01:52:32,801
Does it matter?

1262
01:52:37,416 --> 01:52:39,350
I just don't know why you're doing this.

1263
01:52:39,418 --> 01:52:42,615
- What? The wedding?
- No.

1264
01:52:45,590 --> 01:52:48,423
You're trying to make everyone else happy,

1265
01:52:49,361 --> 01:52:51,921
but you're already giving away too much.

1266
01:52:52,864 --> 01:52:54,354
You're wrong.

1267
01:53:02,374 --> 01:53:05,741
This wasn't a choice
between you and Jacob.

1268
01:53:09,581 --> 01:53:13,677
It was between who I should be
and who I am.

1269
01:53:17,389 --> 01:53:22,383
I've always felt out of step,
like literally stumbling through my life.

1270
01:53:25,564 --> 01:53:27,464
I've never felt normal.

1271
01:53:30,002 --> 01:53:31,936
Because I'm not normal.

1272
01:53:33,171 --> 01:53:34,832
I don't want to be.

1273
01:53:36,341 --> 01:53:41,574
I've had to face death and loss and pain

1274
01:53:42,948 --> 01:53:46,111
in your world,
but I've also never felt stronger

1275
01:53:48,787 --> 01:53:52,120
and more real, more myself.

1276
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:57,021
Because it's my world, too.

1277
01:54:00,265 --> 01:54:02,028
It's where I belong.

1278
01:54:08,874 --> 01:54:11,035
So it's not just about me?

1279
01:54:13,278 --> 01:54:16,304
No. Sorry.

1280
01:54:18,683 --> 01:54:23,746
I've made a mess trying to figure
all this out, but I wanna do it right.

1281
01:54:25,123 --> 01:54:29,526
And I wanna tie myself to you
in every way humanly possible.

1282
01:54:33,865 --> 01:54:35,423
Starting with a wedding.

1283
01:54:39,704 --> 01:54:41,103
Actually,

1284
01:54:42,007 --> 01:54:46,967
something a little more difficult first.
And maybe even dangerous.

1285
01:54:52,717 --> 01:54:54,150
We have to tell Charlie.

1286
01:54:58,323 --> 01:54:59,585
It's highly dangerous.

1287
01:55:00,659 --> 01:55:02,820
It's a good thing you're bulletproof.

1288
01:55:04,896 --> 01:55:06,420
I'm gonna need that ring.

1289
01:55:31,056 --> 01:55:33,650
All the lives

1290
01:55:34,993 --> 01:55:38,895
Always tempted to trade

1291
01:55:42,334 --> 01:55:44,825
Will they hate me

1292
01:55:44,903 --> 01:55:49,465
For all the choices I've made

1293
01:55:53,345 --> 01:55:59,284
Will they stop when they see me again?

1294
01:56:01,086 --> 01:56:06,649
I can't stop now I know who I am

1295
01:56:09,194 --> 01:56:15,190
Now I'm all yours

1296
01:56:15,267 --> 01:56:18,395
I'm not afraid

1297
01:56:18,470 --> 01:56:22,873
I'm yours always

1298
01:56:22,941 --> 01:56:26,001
Say what they may

1299
01:56:26,077 --> 01:56:29,672
And all your love

1300
01:56:29,748 --> 01:56:33,582
I'll take to a grave

1301
01:56:33,652 --> 01:56:37,179
And all my life

1302
01:56:37,255 --> 01:56:42,352
Starts now

1303
01:56:42,427 --> 01:56:44,258
Tear me down

1304
01:56:44,329 --> 01:56:49,790
They can take you out of my thoughts

1305
01:56:53,572 --> 01:56:57,474
Under every scar

1306
01:56:57,542 --> 01:57:01,478
There's a battle I've lost

1307
01:57:04,482 --> 01:57:10,250
Will they stop when they see us again?

1308
01:57:12,257 --> 01:57:17,957
I can't stop now I know who I am

1309
01:57:20,232 --> 01:57:26,432
Now I'm all yours

1310
01:57:26,504 --> 01:57:30,065
I'm not afraid

1311
01:57:30,141 --> 01:57:34,043
I'm yours always

1312
01:57:34,112 --> 01:57:37,275
Say what they may

1313
01:57:37,349 --> 01:57:40,944
And all your love

1314
01:57:41,019 --> 01:57:44,819
I'll take to a grave

1315
01:57:44,889 --> 01:57:51,795
And all my life starts

1316
01:57:52,597 --> 01:57:58,194
I'm all yours

1317
01:57:58,270 --> 01:58:01,671
I'm not afraid

1318
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:05,801
I'm yours always

1319
01:58:05,877 --> 01:58:09,176
Say what they may

1320
01:58:09,247 --> 01:58:12,910
And all your love

1321
01:58:12,984 --> 01:58:16,715
I'll take to a grave

1322
01:58:16,788 --> 01:58:23,523
And all my life starts

1323
01:58:27,399 --> 01:58:30,197
Starts now

1324
01:58:43,248 --> 01:58:46,342
I was a heavy heart to carry

1325
01:58:46,418 --> 01:58:49,319
My beloved was weighed down

1326
01:58:49,387 --> 01:58:52,288
My arms around his neck

1327
01:58:52,357 --> 01:58:55,087
My fingers laced a crown

1328
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:58,061
I was a heavy heart to carry

1329
01:58:58,129 --> 01:59:00,893
My feet dragged across the ground

1330
01:59:00,965 --> 01:59:03,900
And he took me to the river

1331
01:59:03,968 --> 01:59:06,960
Where he slowly let me drown

1332
01:59:07,038 --> 01:59:09,905
My love has concrete feet

1333
01:59:09,974 --> 01:59:13,466
My love's an iron ball

1334
01:59:13,545 --> 01:59:15,911
Wrapped around your ankles

1335
01:59:15,980 --> 01:59:20,383
Over the waterfall

1336
01:59:21,252 --> 01:59:24,653
I'm so heavy

1337
01:59:25,557 --> 01:59:27,184
Heavy

1338
01:59:27,258 --> 01:59:30,056
Heavy in your arms

1339
01:59:33,064 --> 01:59:37,558
I'm so heavy

1340
01:59:37,635 --> 01:59:39,227
Heavy

1341
01:59:39,304 --> 01:59:42,865
Heavy in your arms

1342
01:59:46,478 --> 01:59:49,538
And is it worth the wait

1343
01:59:49,614 --> 01:59:51,809
All this killing time?

1344
01:59:51,916 --> 01:59:54,783
Are you strong enough to stand

1345
01:59:54,853 --> 01:59:58,516
Protecting both your heart and mine?

1346
01:59:58,590 --> 02:00:00,785
Who is the betrayer?

1347
02:00:00,859 --> 02:00:04,556
Who's the killer in the crowd?

1348
02:00:04,629 --> 02:00:07,393
The one who creeps in corridors

1349
02:00:07,465 --> 02:00:09,933
And doesn't make a sound

1350
02:00:10,001 --> 02:00:12,902
My love has concrete feet

1351
02:00:12,971 --> 02:00:16,532
My love is an iron ball

1352
02:00:16,608 --> 02:00:18,940
Wrapped around your ankles

1353
02:00:19,010 --> 02:00:21,945
Over the waterfall

1354
02:00:22,013 --> 02:00:24,982
My love has concrete feet

1355
02:00:25,049 --> 02:00:28,507
My love's an iron ball

1356
02:00:28,586 --> 02:00:31,077
Wrapped around your ankles

1357
02:00:31,156 --> 02:00:34,648
Over the waterfall

1358
02:00:36,227 --> 02:00:40,459
I'm so heavy

1359
02:00:40,532 --> 02:00:42,124
Heavy

1360
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:45,226
Heavy in your arms

1361
02:00:48,072 --> 02:00:52,475
I'm so heavy

1362
02:00:52,544 --> 02:00:54,136
Heavy

1363
02:00:54,212 --> 02:00:58,581
Heavy in your arms

1364
02:01:00,852 --> 02:01:03,878
I was a heavy heart to carry

1365
02:01:03,955 --> 02:01:07,356
My beloved was weighed down

1366
02:01:07,425 --> 02:01:10,121
My arms around his neck

1367
02:01:10,195 --> 02:01:13,062
My fingers laced a crown

1368
02:01:13,131 --> 02:01:15,827
I was a heavy heart to carry

1369
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:18,698
But he never let me down

1370
02:01:18,770 --> 02:01:21,705
When he held me in his arms

1371
02:01:21,773 --> 02:01:24,742
My feet never touched the ground

1372
02:01:24,809 --> 02:01:26,970
I'm so heavy

1373
02:01:29,447 --> 02:01:33,941
I'm so heavy in your arms

1374
02:01:47,799 --> 02:01:50,461
Run, run, run away

1375
02:01:50,535 --> 02:01:52,969
So lost, lost

1376
02:01:53,037 --> 02:01:54,129
Never comin'

1377
02:01:54,205 --> 02:01:57,868
Home rollin', rollin' down a track

1378
02:01:57,942 --> 02:02:01,139
No, no, I'm never comin' back

1379
02:02:01,246 --> 02:02:04,545
Hot love pumpin' in my veins

1380
02:02:04,616 --> 02:02:08,074
Our love, I hope it's not too late

1381
02:02:08,152 --> 02:02:09,847
That's the road, that's the load

1382
02:02:09,921 --> 02:02:10,945
That's the role

1383
02:02:11,022 --> 02:02:12,319
I've been down, I've been down

1384
02:02:12,390 --> 02:02:13,789
I've been down

1385
02:02:14,893 --> 02:02:17,828
What part of forever

1386
02:02:17,896 --> 02:02:20,831
Don't you understand?

1387
02:02:20,899 --> 02:02:23,493
I could stay, stay, stay

1388
02:02:23,568 --> 02:02:26,628
If that's what you want, want, want

1389
02:02:26,704 --> 02:02:30,003
I'd give it to you, you, you

1390
02:02:30,074 --> 02:02:33,475
If I had a heart, heart, heart

1391
02:02:33,545 --> 02:02:36,708
And we could go, go, go

1392
02:02:36,814 --> 02:02:39,282
And never look back on now

1393
02:02:39,350 --> 02:02:42,615
I'd give it to you, you, you

1394
02:02:42,687 --> 02:02:46,521
If I had a heart

1395
02:02:50,094 --> 02:02:53,928
Imagine eternity

1396
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:59,896
Doesn't seem that hard

1397
02:03:01,839 --> 02:03:06,640
They say nothing lasts forever

1398
02:03:08,913 --> 02:03:13,714
We'll have to prove them wrong

1399
02:03:13,785 --> 02:03:16,345
I could stay, stay, stay

1400
02:03:16,421 --> 02:03:19,447
If that's what you want, want, want

1401
02:03:19,524 --> 02:03:22,721
I'd give it to you, you, you

1402
02:03:22,827 --> 02:03:26,661
If I had a heart

1403
02:03:26,731 --> 02:03:29,427
And we could go, go, go

1404
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:33,061
And never look back on now

1405
02:03:33,137 --> 02:03:36,402
I'd give it to you, you, you

1406
02:03:36,474 --> 02:03:40,410
If I had a heart
