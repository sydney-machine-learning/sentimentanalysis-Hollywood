1
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,180
Come on, let's go.

2
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,707
Ashlee darling.

3
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,273
Hm?

4
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,584
Wake up.

5
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,921
Hm.

6
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,928
Wake up.

7
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,602
Temperatures are going
to do nothing but go down.

8
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:25,769
We'll have another very cold day tomorrow.

9
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,142
Morning.

10
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,407
Morning.

11
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,278
...to freezing rain.

12
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,319
The Freewill Baptist Church
is having a fundraiser,

13
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,149
a covered-dish event,
that's coming up here

14
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,655
on Thursday evening,

15
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,090
so they're having a band concert.

16
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,493
That will be on Friday night
at the high school.

17
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,497
Better than nothing.

18
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,597
Who's this?

19
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,138
Peanut Butter.

20
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,798
Where'd you find Peanut Butter?

21
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,705
In the woods.

22
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,939
He's sweet.

23
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,450
Spell "house."

24
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,350
H-O...

25
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,355
H-O...

26
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,015
A-woo.

27
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,025
U-A?

28
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,651
- Uh-uh.
- U.

29
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,389
Ssssss.

30
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,987
S-E?

31
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,896
H-O-U-S-E.

32
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,570
7 plus 2.

33
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,165
9.

34
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,971
Good.

35
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,742
Transfer.

36
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,081
Careful.

37
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,056
Cradle the head,

38
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,423
and then take him to your shoulder...

39
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,556
so he's up a little bit higher

40
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,225
but you're still supporting the head.

41
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,098
Make sure you hold this right under...

42
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,694
Could I have your attention, please?

43
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,002
Forsyth, Missouri chapter

44
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,872
of the Family, Consumer,
and Career Leaders of America...

45
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,411
Hey, Ree.

46
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,779
...will meet this Friday at 3:00 p.m.
In Mrs. Boyer's room.

47
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,613
Truman University will be here...

48
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:48,017
Forward, march!

49
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,850
If you would like to attend,

50
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,186
please sign up in the counselor's office.

51
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,691
March time.

52
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,594
Forward, march.

53
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,895
The Marine Corps Birthday Ball

54
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,528
will be this Saturday evening.

55
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:10,372
All other P.C. Cadets and their families
are encouraged to attend.

56
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,607
All right.

57
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,427
Hi, Sonya.

58
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,966
Hey, Ree.

59
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,904
You and the kids all right?

60
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:45,967
We're just a little short on cash right now.

61
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,674
How long's it been since the horse ate?

62
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,740
About four days.

63
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:53,308
That hay gets kind of expensive, don't it?

64
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,149
Yes ma'am.

65
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:00,521
Actually, I was wondering
if you could keep her with yours.

66
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,276
All right, Ginger, come on.

67
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,936
That's a girl.

68
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,707
There you go. There you go.

69
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,112
Have a little bit of that.

70
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,380
Come on. Get going.

71
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,513
Thank you, Sonya.

72
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,558
All right.

73
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,531
How are you today?

74
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,439
Ask me inside.

75
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,000
I need to talk something with your mama.

76
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,116
She don't talk much.

77
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,354
Ma'am?

78
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,223
I was wondering
if I could ask you a few questions.

79
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,588
Ma'am?

80
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,603
You better just tell me.

81
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,472
You know your daddy's
out on bond, don't you?

82
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,949
So what?

83
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,986
Looks like he's been cooking again.

84
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:11,490
I know that's the charges you laid on him,
but you ain't proved it on him.

85
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,650
You got to prove it every time.

86
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,456
Well, that won't be no hard thing to do,

87
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,622
but that ain't even why I'm here.

88
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:22,657
His court date's next week,
and I can't seem to turn him up.

89
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,259
Maybe he sees you and ducks.

90
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,932
That could be,

91
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,168
but where you all come into this is,

92
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,938
he put this house here,

93
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,172
and your timber acres, up for his bond.

94
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,612
He what, now?

95
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,776
Jessup signed over everything.

96
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,786
Now, if he doesn't show at trial, see,

97
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,483
the way the deal works is,
you all gonna lose this place.

98
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,662
You got some place to go?

99
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,766
I'll find him.

100
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,598
- Girl, I've been looking.
- I said I'll find him.

101
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:12,111
You make sure your daddy
knows the gravity of this deal.

102
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,011
Maybe they'll share some of that with us.

103
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,552
That could be.

104
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,851
Maybe we should ask.

105
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,491
Never ask for what ought to be offered.

106
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,410
Evening, Ree.

107
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:18,212
- Evening.
- Kids. Hey, Connie.

108
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,014
Didn't want you to think
we'd forgot you all.

109
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,783
Brought you some meat, some potatoes,

110
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,791
and some stuff for a good stew, anyway.

111
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,258
Thank you. We can use it.

112
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,353
I seen your woodpile's low out front.

113
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,365
We got that splitter up there in the yard.

114
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,627
You should use it.

115
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,635
I'll do that.

116
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,297
We seen the law was
out here this afternoon.

117
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,806
Everything all right?

118
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,138
He's huntin' for Dad.

119
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,768
Hunting Jessup, is he?

120
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,238
You know where he's at?

121
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,580
No.

122
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,449
You sure about that?

123
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,889
Yes.

124
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,449
All right.

125
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,291
All right, well I guess you didn't have
nothing to tell him then, did you?

126
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,298
I wouldn't tell him nothing if I did.

127
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,664
Honey, we know that.

128
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,760
I'm going to let you get to it, all right?

129
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,609
How about some deer stew.
That sound good?

130
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,674
Mm-hm.

131
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,414
Both of you need to get over here
and watch how I make it.

132
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,654
Thank God it's you, Sweet Pea,

133
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,212
and not Floyd's
mommy and daddy again.

134
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,817
Them two watch me
like I done something wrong.

135
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,361
Hush your mouth about them.

136
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,159
They put a roof
over your head, ain't they?

137
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:17,293
Hey, Floyd. You gonna invite me in?

138
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,998
Or I could just stay
out here and talk to you.

139
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,007
Yeah, you can come in.

140
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,754
Hey.

141
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,519
Shit.

142
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,323
Don't start.

143
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,657
C'mon.

144
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,906
It's been a while, Sweet Pea.

145
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,240
Things stack up, is all.

146
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,176
What's going on?

147
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,242
The Sheriff came by looking for Dad.

148
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,616
If he don't show up for his court date,

149
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,915
we're gonna lose the house.

150
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,225
I gotta get down to the Arkansas line.

151
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,456
I gotta ask him.

152
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,431
It's his truck.

153
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,483
He said no.

154
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,115
Did you tell him I'd spring for gas?

155
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,057
I told him. He still won't.

156
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,594
Why not?

157
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,959
He never says why not to me, Ree.

158
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,657
He just says no.

159
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,665
Man, that's so sad to hear you say

160
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,793
he won't let you do something
and then you don't do it.

161
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,304
It's different once you're married.

162
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:06,139
It really must be because you ain't
never used to eat no shit.

163
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,247
Ned needs his nap.

164
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,415
Come here.

165
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,046
What brings you here?

166
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,051
Somebody dead?

167
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,780
I'm looking for my Dad.

168
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,183
Come on in. Shake off the chill.

169
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,190
Let's keep it quiet.

170
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,994
Teardrop's still laying up in bed.

171
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,807
The law came by today.

172
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:14,141
Dad signed over everything to his bond.

173
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,477
Victoria, I really gotta run
Dad down to get him to show.

174
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,314
You ought not do that.

175
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,313
Don't go running after Jessup.

176
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:30,016
Show or don't show,
that choice is up to the one going to jail,

177
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,926
not you.

178
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,932
You know where he's at, don't you?

179
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,528
Where a man's at ain't necessarily
for you to know, neither.

180
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,732
- But you do.
- I ain't seen him.

181
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:53,546
Could be running around
with Little Arthur and them, you think?

182
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,052
Don't you ever go down
around Little Arthur's

183
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,453
asking them people about shit
they ain't offering to talk about.

184
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:02,358
That's a real good way
to end up bit by hogs...

185
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,952
or wishing you was.

186
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,391
We're all related, ain't we?

187
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,901
Our relations get watered kind of thin
between here and Little Arthur's.

188
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,638
You know all those people, Teardrop.

189
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,475
- You could ask...
- Shut up.

190
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,812
None of them's gonna be
in a great big hurry to tangle with you.

191
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,044
I said shut up once already
with my mouth.

192
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,926
Jesus. Dad's your only brother.

193
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,760
You think I forgot that?

194
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,390
Hm?

195
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,061
Jessup and me run together
for coming on 40 years,

196
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,763
but I don't know where he's at,

197
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,602
and I ain't gonna go around
asking after him, neither.

198
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,608
Ree, you still planning to join the Army?

199
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,173
No, I don't think I can anymore.

200
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,779
Listen.

201
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,081
Hm?

202
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,024
No.

203
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,550
She needs help.

204
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,890
Nope. Listen.

205
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,793
Listen.

206
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:49,994
You tell that girl to stay close to home.

207
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,060
Don't move.

208
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,196
Give her this.

209
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,901
You send her ass on her way right now.

210
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:07,983
Teardrop says you best keep
your ass real close to the willows, dear.

211
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,487
He hopes this helps.

212
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,721
Here's a doobie for your walk.

213
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,494
Thank you.

214
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,765
Hey.

215
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,494
What's your business here?

216
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,263
My dad's Jessup.

217
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,328
He's pals with Little Arthur,
and I gotta find him.

218
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,904
Hold on.

219
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,165
My name's Megan.

220
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,433
And I do know you, really.

221
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,203
I seen you at some of the reunions.

222
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,271
I knew Jessup when I seen him, too.

223
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,145
Never did talk with him much.

224
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,811
You knew him?

225
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,788
Knew him when I seen him
around, I mean.

226
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,790
He does stuff I hear about.

227
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,656
- He cooks crank.
- They all do now.

228
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,491
You don't even need to say it out loud.

229
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,966
If Arthur's been running
on crank for a day or two,

230
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,906
you should just leave, okay?

231
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,979
I knew it.

232
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,318
I been in your dreams,
ain't I, little Ruthie?

233
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,086
It's Ree, you asshole.

234
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,855
I'm only out to find Dad.

235
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,862
Come on in, ladies.

236
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,268
This don't gotta take long, man.

237
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,871
I'm looking for Dad and thought maybe
you'd been seeing him.

238
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,009
Maybe you two been getting
into stuff together again.

239
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,581
Not since the summer,

240
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,284
at ya'll's place.

241
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,292
You ain't seen him nowhere since then?

242
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,884
Uh-uh.

243
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:42,457
He kept leaving
the house, going some place.

244
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:45,059
You don't know where?

245
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,798
You got cat shit in your ear, girl?

246
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,399
I've got them two kids
and my Mom to tend, man.

247
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,067
I need him.

248
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:56,376
If I see the dude,
I'll tell him you said that.

249
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:03,611
Your dad left you to do all that?

250
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,418
That's fucked up.

251
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,983
Well, he had to.

252
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,829
The way things go, you know.

253
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,936
You want a line?

254
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,241
No.

255
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,940
You wanna blow some smoke?

256
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,916
No.

257
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,849
Then I guess I got nothin' for you.

258
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,184
Go on.

259
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,992
Don't tell nobody it was me
who told you this, okay?

260
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,798
But you're going to have to go on
up the hill

261
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,307
and ask for a talk with Thump Milton.

262
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,106
Now, I hope he'll talk with you.

263
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,112
He generally won't.

264
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,876
That man scares me
way more than the rest.

265
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,147
Well, scared ain't a bad way
to be about him, neither, hon.

266
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,687
He's my own grandpa,

267
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,485
and I still make damn sure
I never piss him off none.

268
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,458
You go see Thump.

269
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,892
Go on.

270
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,740
You got the wrong place, I expect.

271
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,636
Who might you be?

272
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:11,204
I'm Ree.

273
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,251
My Dad's Jessup Dolly.

274
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,886
You ain't here for trouble, are you?

275
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,896
No, ma'am.

276
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,091
'Cause one of my nephews is Buster Leroy,

277
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,329
and didn't he shoot
your daddy one time?

278
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,964
Yes, but that ain't got
nothing to do with me.

279
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,974
They settled that theirselves, I think.

280
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,976
Shooting him likely settled it.

281
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,443
What is it you want?

282
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,449
I got a real bad need to talk with Thump.

283
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,486
And he ain't got no need to talk to you.

284
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,953
But I need to.

285
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:55,356
I really, I really, really
got to, ma'am, please.

286
00:24:58,129 --> 00:24:59,926
Some of our blood at least is the same.

287
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,329
Ain't that supposed to mean something?

288
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,196
Ain't that what is always said?

289
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,811
Ain't you got no men could do this?

290
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,540
No, ma'am, I don't.

291
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:22,548
You go wait in the yard
somewhere by that coop,

292
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,556
and I'll tell Thump you're here.

293
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,955
Thanks.

294
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,054
Come on, already.

295
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,041
He ain't likely to have time for you, child.

296
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,771
I've got to talk to him.

297
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,608
If he don't know, nobody does.

298
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,046
Nope.

299
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:27,744
Talking just causes witnesses,
and he don't want for any of those.

300
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,411
I'll wait.

301
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,383
You need to get yourself on home.

302
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,461
Here, drink it down and be on your way.

303
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,296
Thanks.

304
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:54,268
Thump knows you were in the valley, child,

305
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:58,077
with Megan, and at Little Arthur's.

306
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,913
He knows what you want to ask,
and he don't want to hear it.

307
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,954
And that's it?

308
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:06,047
He ain't gonna say nothing to me?

309
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,888
If you're listening, child,
you got your answer.

310
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,226
So I guess come the nut-cutting,

311
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,992
blood don't really mean shit
to the big man.

312
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,555
Am I understanding that right?

313
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,096
Don't you dare.

314
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,135
Don't.

315
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,111
I want you to listen to me, child.

316
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,080
You need to turn around,
and get yourself on home.

317
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,451
Don't you make me come
out here and tell you again.

318
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,459
Ashlee Dawn, come inside.

319
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,125
Bring Brownie and Cupcake.

320
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,908
Ree, get out here!

321
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,877
Do you know there's people going around
saying you best shut up?

322
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,247
People you ought to listen to.

323
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,309
- Get your ass in the truck.
- Don't touch me.

324
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,049
- Get your ass in the truck.
- Get off!

325
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,523
Get in the truck.

326
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:49,253
Hey!

327
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,851
Would you rather I hit you, boy?

328
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,590
Sonny, get back in the house.

329
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,599
Cook them taters till they're brown,
then turn the stove off.

330
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,658
- Don't hurt my sister.
- Sonny!

331
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,067
Having balls is good, boy.

332
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,695
Don't let 'em get you hurt.

333
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:01,932
Sonny, get in the house.

334
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,870
Get your dumb ass in the truck.

335
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,673
- I'm not getting in there with you.
- Get in the truck.

336
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,373
There's something you need to see.

337
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:17,177
Jessup and me
may have had our tussles,

338
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,780
but he was my cousin.

339
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,952
It's always a bad deal
when these things blow.

340
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,358
Where are we going?

341
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,397
- Down the road.
- Down the road to where?

342
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:28,295
To someplace you need to see.

343
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,925
This right here is the last place me
or anybody seen Jessup.

344
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,091
He never blew no lab before.

345
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,659
I know it, but something
must have jumped wrong this time.

346
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:09,605
He's known for never fucking up labs
or cooking bad batches.

347
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,801
He's known for knowing
what he's doing.

348
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,902
Well, you cook long enough,
this is bound to happen.

349
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,947
You're saying Dad's up there
burnt to a crisp?

350
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,277
That's what I'm saying.

351
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:19,680
I'm going up for a look.

352
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:22,311
No! That shit's poison.

353
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,945
It'll rip the skin off your bones.

354
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,115
If Dad's up there,
I'm bringing him home to bury.

355
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,954
Ree!

356
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:38,426
Ree, I know losing Jessup

357
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,396
leaves you all hurting over there.

358
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,592
I know it's a lot to handle.

359
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,498
We'll make do.

360
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,036
Sonya and me talked about it.

361
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:49,267
We feel we could take Sonny
off your hands.

362
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,070
Not Ashlee, I don't reckon,
but we could take Sonny.

363
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:54,077
You what?

364
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,045
We could take him and raise
him up the rest of the way.

365
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,207
My ass you will.

366
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,773
We'd raise that boy way better

367
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,944
than you and that
nut-job mama of yours can.

368
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,853
Maybe on down the line
we'd take Ashlee, too.

369
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,914
You go straight to hell, you son of a bitch.

370
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:10,051
Sonny and Ashlee will die
living in a cave with me and Mama

371
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,824
before they spend one night with you.

372
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,562
God damn you.

373
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,660
You must think I'm a stupid idiot.

374
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,830
There's weeds growing
chin high in that place.

375
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,999
It must have been a year
since that place blew.

376
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:10,213
Come here, look at this.
Ash, quit playing around. Come here.

377
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,316
This trigger shoots this barrel.

378
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,257
This trigger shoots this barrel.

379
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,761
Now, there's hardly ever
gonna be a time where you need both,

380
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,458
but if you gotta kill something
big and mean, then you use both.

381
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:25,798
Now, this gun is what
you'll use when you're older,

382
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,067
but this one is the gun I learned on.

383
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,165
This is Daddy's squirrel gun.

384
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,675
Now, the most important thing is

385
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:36,145
do not put your finger on the trigger
unless you're ready to shoot,

386
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:37,738
you're aimed at your target.

387
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,477
And don't ever... both of you look at me...

388
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:44,146
never point this at each other, not ever.

389
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,985
All right?

390
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,615
Kneel down like you're praying.

391
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,853
Yeah, just like that. Yup.

392
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,426
You see that cross?

393
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,592
It's called the crosshairs.

394
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,828
Aim that up with the middle
of your target,

395
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:00,495
and when that's lined up in the middle,

396
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,266
then you squeeze
the trigger and you shoot.

397
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,977
- Okay.
- Ree.

398
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,308
Hang in.

399
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,972
Hey.

400
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,017
We're back here. Put this down.

401
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,551
Both of you sit on your hands.

402
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:17,349
Don't touch it.

403
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:19,652
- Hey.
- Hey.

404
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,715
Damn, Sweet Pea.
What's with all the guns?

405
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:25,320
Just teaching them a little bit of survival.

406
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,795
Hi.

407
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,399
Got the truck off him.

408
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:42,142
You are who I always did
think you were, darlin'.

409
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,681
You truly are.

410
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,726
Now, you gotta turn it this way.

411
00:35:05,803 --> 00:35:07,361
Backwards?

412
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,905
Yeah. Give me that.

413
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,543
Does your mama know what's going on?

414
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,239
I'm not sure.

415
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,545
You think you should tell her?

416
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:24,281
This is the exact shit
she went crazy trying to get away from.

417
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,879
It'd be too mean to tell her.

418
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,549
I guess she couldn't help anyhow.

419
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:30,424
Nope.

420
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:45,307
I look on that valley far below.

421
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:50,370
It's green as far as I can see.

422
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,916
As my memories return,

423
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,544
Oh, how my heart does yearn

424
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,056
for you and the days that used to be.

425
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,553
High on the mountain,

426
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,994
wind blowing free,

427
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,998
I wonder if you still remember me.

428
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,328
Play it through.

429
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:25,242
I wonder if you still remember me.

430
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:29,013
Or has time erased your memory?

431
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,679
As I listen to the breeze

432
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,521
whisper gently through the trees,

433
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:39,427
I wonder if you still remember me.

434
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,189
Say.

435
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,841
Come on in.

436
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,139
It's Ma's birthday.

437
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,942
Happy Birthday.

438
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,146
Y'all want anything?

439
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,015
Something to drink, food?

440
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,883
I'm hunting for Dad.

441
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,816
I was guessing that.

442
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,554
Stars on a summer morning.

443
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,186
Come on now.

444
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,564
First appear,

445
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,569
and then they're gone.

446
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,203
Wish I was

447
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:28,645
a little sparrow

448
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,079
and I had wings

449
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,347
and I could fly.

450
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,719
I'd fly straight away.

451
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:44,190
You know me and Jessup
quit keeping company

452
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,854
a good while ago.

453
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:50,701
I figured.

454
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,827
I thought you might still
know a thing or two.

455
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:56,099
I'm kind of afraid I might.

456
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:00,904
I wish I could kick back for this one, Ree.

457
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,240
You still bad on the bottle?

458
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,214
No. No, I give that up.

459
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,418
A couple months ago,

460
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,686
Jessup and me run across
each other by total accident.

461
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:21,093
He got me to laughing so.

462
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,463
Things rekindled for a day or two.

463
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:27,595
Then he was gone again.

464
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:33,237
About, maybe, three or four weeks back,

465
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,747
I'd stopped at Cruikshank's,

466
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:40,443
and he was in there with
three fellows I didn't know,

467
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,043
and they didn't look
to be having no fun, either.

468
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,815
Did Dad say anything?

469
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:47,983
He looked square at me

470
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,119
but acted like he didn't know me,

471
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,720
like he'd never seen me before.

472
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,394
Something real wrong was going on.

473
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:07,842
I'm sorry.

474
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:21,285
If you stay really still and quiet...

475
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,656
it'll come out. Bless you.

476
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,621
How long do we have to wait for a squirrel?

477
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,166
A long time, usually.

478
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:32,168
Wish we could get deer.

479
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,101
It's not time for deer.

480
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,672
When is it?

481
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,767
In the morning or at night.
You know that.

482
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,777
Do you see one?

483
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,511
- Mmm.
- I do.

484
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:50,281
Where?

485
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:51,616
There.

486
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,385
Ah.

487
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:58,224
You want to help me pull the trigger?

488
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,126
All right, put your finger right there.

489
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,497
All right, you guys want
these fried or stewed?

490
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,900
- Fried.
- Fried.

491
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,199
Fried?

492
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:09,637
All right.

493
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,810
- Hey.
- Hey.

494
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,549
All right.
Now, get your fingers in there.

495
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,182
I'll get mine in.

496
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,853
1, 2, 3.

497
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,725
Pull. Pull hard.

498
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,395
Now, I'm just gonna slit it down here.

499
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:46,202
Now, get in there
and get them guts out.

500
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,744
I don't want to.

501
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,337
Sonny, there's a bunch of stuff

502
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,245
that you're gonna have to get over
being scared of.

503
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,341
I'm not scared. I just don't want to.

504
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,521
Come on.

505
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,920
Put your fingers in there.

506
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:06,856
Good.

507
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,759
Do we eat these parts?

508
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,134
Not yet.

509
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:02,015
- You think I forgot about you?
- What do you mean?

510
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:04,179
Forgot about you and everything
happening over here?

511
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,917
That's your business.
You forget us if you want.

512
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,421
The law found Jessup's car
at Gullet Lake this morning.

513
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,192
Somebody set fire to it last night,

514
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,666
burnt it down to nothing almost.

515
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:19,532
He wasn't in it.

516
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,969
He's gone, ain't he?

517
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:31,971
This is for you all.

518
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:38,986
His court day was this morning.
He didn't show.

519
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,123
I'd sell off your timber land
now while you can.

520
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,855
No, uh-uh.
We won't be doin' nothin' like that.

521
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,626
That's the very first thing they'll do.

522
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,135
Once they've took this place
from under you all, girl,

523
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:55,171
go out and cut them
hundred-year woods down to nubs.

524
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:02,008
Might as well have the dough
to spend on your own.

525
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,239
Hm?

526
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,088
You get the taste for it yet?

527
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,599
Not so far.

528
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,894
Suit yourself, little girl.

529
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:32,406
Them pills helping
your mama's mood any?

530
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:36,435
She keeps takin' them,
but they ain't working.

531
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:42,781
Tell her hey.

532
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,963
Mom, look at me.

533
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:22,179
There's things happening,
and I don't know what to do.

534
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:29,116
Can you please help me this one time?

535
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:30,683
Mom?

536
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,729
Mom, look at me.

537
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,731
Teardrop thinks
I should sell the woods, Mom.

538
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,336
Should I sell?

539
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:55,241
Please, help me this one time.

540
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,269
I don't know what to do.

541
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,501
Who the hell is he?

542
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,596
Judging by that car, he ain't
from our neck of the woods.

543
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:04,853
Mike Satterfield, A-1 Bonds.

544
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,480
What is it you want?

545
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:08,855
We hold the bond on Jessup Dolly,

546
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,917
and now he's a runner, it looks like.

547
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,461
Dad ain't no runner.

548
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,463
He didn't show for court.
That makes him a runner.

549
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,625
Will you excuse us, please?

550
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,464
Go on.

551
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:24,199
Look, I don't want to kick
your dad's ass, all right?

552
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:26,174
I just want to keep the judge off mine.

553
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,268
Dad is dead.

554
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,677
He didn't show for court
'cause he's lying dead somewhere.

555
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:32,044
When was the last time you saw him?

556
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:33,878
A couple of weeks.

557
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:36,317
Who's he running around with?
Where they all hanging out?

558
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,513
He doesn't tell me that stuff, sir.

559
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:39,988
You know I got the legal right

560
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:42,651
to go in there hunting the man
any place I want.

561
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:44,717
I know you'd be wasting your time

562
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:47,662
and pissing me off.

563
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,722
Jessup Dolly is dead.

564
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,791
He's lying in a crappy grave somewhere

565
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,996
or become piles of shit in a hog pen.

566
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:56,665
Maybe he's been left out plain in the open.

567
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,072
Wherever he is, he's there dead.

568
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:01,076
And you know this how?

569
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:02,839
You must've heard what Dollys are,
ain't you, mister?

570
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:04,471
Well, I've heard what some are anyhow,

571
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,516
and I have bonded a few.

572
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,710
I'm a Dolly, bred and buttered,

573
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:12,084
and that's how I know Dad's dead.

574
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:19,593
How old are you?

575
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:21,187
17.

576
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,008
You know, uh, your daddy
was short on his bond.

577
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:35,408
This house and stuff here
couldn't cover it, not nearly.

578
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,606
D'you know that?

579
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,740
I didn't know nothin'.
They told me everything after.

580
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:42,876
Well, he was short on his bond,

581
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:45,183
but then this fella comes
in the office one evening,

582
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,018
got him a sack full of crinkled money

583
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,287
and just laid it down right there,
covered the rest.

584
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,387
Seemed like somebody
needed him sprung in a hurry.

585
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,125
This fella with the money have a name?

586
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,962
Shit, no.

587
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,969
Probably left that in his other pants.

588
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:11,603
How long before we get
kicked off our own property?

589
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,651
I reckon...

590
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,879
I reckon you all got this place
about another week.

591
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,421
That's my guess.

592
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:19,819
A week?

593
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,619
And there ain't nothing I can do?

594
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:22,920
Nope.

595
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,426
Ain't nothing left to do...

596
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,487
unless you can prove he's dead.

597
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,609
Catfish, Blond, you boys
staying out of trouble?

598
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:26,778
Thump Milton!

599
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,883
I need to talk to you!

600
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,222
Thump Milton.

601
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:40,258
Thump Milton!

602
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:42,956
Thump!

603
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:19,468
I told you to leave him be.

604
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:27,333
Get her, Alice.

605
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,275
No, you don't.

606
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,456
That's what you get for not listening to me.

607
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:11,351
You was warned.

608
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:14,390
You was warned nice,
and you wouldn't listen.

609
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:17,190
Why didn't you listen?

610
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,584
What are we ever going to do
with you, baby girl?

611
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,682
Kill me, I guess.

612
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,764
That idea has been said already.

613
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,691
Got any others?

614
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,032
Help me.

615
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:03,368
Ain't nobody said
that idea yet, have they?

616
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:08,176
I tried to help you some before.

617
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,179
This is what come of it.

618
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,930
You got somethin' to say,
child, you best say it now.

619
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:51,588
I got two kids
that can't feed themselves yet.

620
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:56,251
My mom's sick,
and she's always gonna be sick.

621
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:01,320
Pretty soon the laws are coming
and taking our house

622
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:04,731
and throwing us out to live
in the field like dogs.

623
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:14,673
If Dad has done wrong, Dad has paid,

624
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:17,235
and whoever killed him,
I don't need to know all that.

625
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,786
But I can't forever carry them kids...

626
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:27,482
and my mom,

627
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:29,286
not without that house.

628
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,134
Oh, shit.

629
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,307
I ain't gonna stand here naked
when that motherfucker comes in.

630
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,328
Where is she?

631
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:09,126
Don't get all excited, Teardrop.

632
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,565
She was warned, and more than once.

633
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:17,867
You hit her?

634
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,806
He never.

635
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:25,742
No man here touched that crazy girl.

636
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:27,749
I put the hurt on her,

637
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:29,148
me and my sisters.

638
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,743
They was here, too.

639
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,996
What Jessup done was against our ways.

640
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,505
He knew it, I know it,

641
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,701
and I ain't raised no stink at all
about whatever became of him.

642
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:58,242
But she ain't my brother.

643
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:08,918
She's about all
the close family I got left,

644
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:11,722
so I'll be collecting her now

645
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:14,059
and carrying her on out of here to home.

646
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,529
That suit you, Thump?

647
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,462
You're gonna stand for her, are you?

648
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,473
If she does wrong, you can put it on me.

649
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:35,282
She's now yours to answer for.

650
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:43,320
This is a girl
who ain't gonna tell nobody nothing.

651
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,730
You boys give him a hand.

652
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,827
Go on, put her in his truck.

653
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,859
Chomp down on that
till the blood lets up.

654
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:03,537
Your daddy couldn't face this last bust,

655
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:05,870
couldn't face a 10-year jolt.

656
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,043
He started talking to that fucking sheriff.

657
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:17,509
You own me now.

658
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:19,145
Understand?

659
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:25,083
They been waiting to see
if I'll do anything.

660
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,258
Watching.

661
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:34,665
I can't know for a certain fact
who went and killed my little brother.

662
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:39,664
Even if you find out,

663
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,233
you can't ever let me know who killed him.

664
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:49,044
Knowing that would just mean
I'd be toes up myself pretty soon.

665
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:52,885
Deal?

666
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,710
No, get out of the... open the door.

667
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,477
- What? What's happened?
- Go on. Watch out.

668
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,463
Gonna burn.

669
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:42,235
Squeeze my hand.

670
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:07,252
Thank you.

671
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,532
I just heard.

672
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:21,305
I brought these over for you.

673
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:25,279
They're painkillers. They're real strong.

674
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:29,207
These are gonna kick in real quick.

675
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:31,617
- Start with two.
- Okay.

676
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,053
She's gonna want more,

677
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,612
but start with two and build from there,

678
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,989
whatever number lets her rest.

679
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,789
Thank you.

680
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:56,238
Will you stay until I fall asleep first?

681
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:57,745
Yeah, I will.

682
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:00,146
But then make sure
they're doing their homework.

683
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,683
All right.

684
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:43,148
Does your arm hurt?

685
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:44,853
No.

686
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,588
Not bad.

687
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:13,009
Blond Milton said him and Sonya
would take Sonny in.

688
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:14,310
I tell you that?

689
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:18,753
Raise him on up from here for me.

690
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:22,789
Does he know? Sonny?

691
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:25,860
Not from us.

692
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:32,500
If he knows, it's from somebody else
blabbing, 'cause I never.

693
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:36,628
He doesn't even know Dad cooks.

694
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,038
If they took him, that might help some.

695
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:41,700
What about Ashlee?

696
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:47,646
She don't shine for them.

697
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:55,688
Well, what else can you do?

698
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,888
Beg Victoria and Teardrop
to take Ashlee in.

699
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:04,490
God, I hope that ain't
the way it goes, Sweet Pea.

700
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:08,360
I hope to hell it ain't.

701
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:16,404
It was nice meeting you.

702
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:18,037
- Have a good day, okay?
- Thanks.

703
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:23,382
Hi, how you doing? Sergeant Schalk.

704
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,147
- Ree Dolly.
- Nice to meet you.

705
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:27,485
So what brought you
down here today, Ree?

706
01:05:27,556 --> 01:05:30,992
Um, I wanted to find out more
about the $40,000 I get for signing up.

707
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,755
Well, that's a good reason
for joining,

708
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:34,557
but why don't you give me
three better reasons for joining?

709
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,564
Because once you join up,
there's no turning back,

710
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:39,226
and it might not be worth
$40,000 dollars to you.

711
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:41,395
Well, the main reason
is I need the money.

712
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:44,871
It'd be nice to travel, I suppose.

713
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:48,570
You know, five years
is a long commitment.

714
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:50,168
Well, how long
before I get the money?

715
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:52,373
Well, after you sign up,
it would be anywhere

716
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,075
between 14 weeks to 82 weeks.

717
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,550
Well, how come it doesn't say that
on the poster?

718
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,452
Probably a clerical error,
or it just wasn't on there.

719
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:01,456
It might have been
in fine print at the bottom.

720
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:05,357
Do you mind me asking,
what happened to your...

721
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:07,020
your eye and your lip?

722
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:09,257
I fell off my bike.

723
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:10,924
Fell off a bike?

724
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:14,395
Well, um, how old are you?

725
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,597
- 17.
- You're 17.

726
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:19,766
Okay. Now, if this is something
you really wanted to do,

727
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:21,901
we'd have to bring Mom and Dad
in on this, okay?

728
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,309
I can sign for myself.

729
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:25,108
Not at 17, you can't.

730
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:29,641
At 17 you're still considered
a minor by the U.S. Government.

731
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:31,584
You have to be 18 to sign up.

732
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,088
Would it be a problem
getting Mom and Dad in here?

733
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,646
I mean, I can come out
to you guys' house...

734
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:37,249
My mom is sick.

735
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,988
My dad's... gone.

736
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:43,293
Well, do you have any brothers or sisters
that might be able to help?

737
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:45,926
I got a little brother
and a little sister, 12 and 6.

738
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,663
Well, who's taking care of them right now?

739
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:49,932
- I am.
- You are?

740
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,633
Is that why you need the $40,000?

741
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:53,140
Yes, sir.

742
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:56,303
Well, it sounds like
it might be a bigger challenge

743
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:57,971
just to stay home, you know,

744
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:59,674
and actually take care
of your brother and sister

745
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:01,580
because you know you're not
going to be able to take them

746
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,174
with you to training, right?

747
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,447
I thought maybe I could.

748
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,182
Not right at the beginning.

749
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:09,451
Plus you wouldn't be able to have them

750
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,425
when you're actually
in the active duty Army

751
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,155
because who's going to be
there to take care of them

752
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:15,094
if you have to go off and actually fight?

753
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:19,198
So it sounds like right now

754
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:21,702
you need to buckle up and stay home.

755
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:24,137
It's going to take a lot of backbone
and a lot of courage to stay home,

756
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:27,801
but that, I think, is what you need to do
right at this point.

757
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,708
Okay?

758
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:32,714
Now, something might change
here in the next year or so.

759
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:35,808
You might decide
this is what you want to do, you know?

760
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,877
But don't take it lightly,
and don't do it just for the money.

761
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:40,819
You need to have a good reason
to do this, okay?

762
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,881
- Okay.
- All right, well, it was nice meeting you.

763
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:44,289
Nice meeting you.

764
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,622
Have a good day, okay?

765
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:47,525
Thank you.

766
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:12,414
What's going on?

767
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:15,082
I'm tired of waiting around
for shit to come down.

768
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:18,223
Let's get out and poke 'em
where they're at,

769
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:19,852
see what happens.

770
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:11,277
Oh, Lord.

771
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:04,722
Ray and them are over there.

772
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,147
Ray.

773
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,244
What do you want?

774
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:26,879
I ain't seen him.

775
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:30,585
If I could help you, I would.

776
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:33,651
There's certain things you can't do.

777
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:35,890
It's bullshit, this fucking shit, man.

778
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,034
You're useless as tits on a fucking boar.

779
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:42,536
I don't know where he is.

780
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:44,072
It's gonna be much worse
next time I come back.

781
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:47,006
I'll tell you that right now.

782
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,909
Best thing you can do
is leave it alone, brother.

783
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:52,447
Believe me.
You come back up in here,

784
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:54,573
you gonna get you an ass whoopin'
that won't quit.

785
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:56,277
Oh, yeah?

786
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:59,219
Look what the fuck
this shit already caused.

787
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:04,517
What the hell?

788
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:18,867
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

789
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,440
Hey!

790
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:27,974
It's on now.

791
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,815
It's so on.

792
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:35,448
We're coming after you, dude.

793
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:38,322
We're coming,
and we're bringing hell, too.

794
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:56,634
What the hell are we doing?

795
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:58,907
Looking for humps that ain't settled.

796
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,330
Oh, hell.

797
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:30,205
He ain't here.

798
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:49,497
He ain't anywhere.

799
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:57,504
He's somewhere.

800
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:29,167
Teardrop.

801
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:30,705
You should stop.

802
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:32,331
Just see what he wants.

803
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:45,243
Shh...

804
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:08,574
Get out of the truck, Teardrop.

805
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:11,306
I need to talk to you.

806
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,575
I don't think so.

807
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:16,413
It ain't about you.

808
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:18,043
You're not in trouble.

809
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,610
It's about your brother.

810
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:22,384
Nope.

811
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,427
Tonight I ain't doin'
a fucking thing you say.

812
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:28,793
Get out of the truck.

813
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:31,128
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

814
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,964
Come on, get out.

815
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:37,635
Why'd you tell?

816
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,936
Why?

817
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:47,338
You went and got his ass killed.

818
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:48,781
You happy now?

819
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:01,456
I know you.

820
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:04,761
I know your family.

821
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,266
Get out of the car now.

822
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:25,880
Is this gonna be our time?

823
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:04,681
What I really can't stand

824
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:09,493
is why I feel so ashamed for Dad.

825
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,261
Well, he loved you all.

826
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:15,870
That's where he went weak.

827
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,235
Lots of us can be tough,

828
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:21,742
plenty tough enough,

829
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:24,335
and do it for a long stretch, too.

830
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:27,711
But snitching.

831
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:31,275
For lots and lots 'a years he wasn't.

832
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:34,413
He wasn't, he wasn't,
and one day he was.

833
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:58,441
You always have scared me.

834
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:02,149
That's 'cause you're smart.

835
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,634
Will you look through this stuff?

836
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:25,138
See what you want to keep?

837
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:35,480
That's Dad.

838
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:37,643
And Teardrop.

839
01:17:41,256 --> 01:17:43,816
Ashlee, you remember
when Dad made that for you?

840
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:45,189
Mm-hm.

841
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:51,022
Look at this guy with her.

842
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:52,293
That's him?

843
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:53,425
Mm-hm.

844
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,629
How old was he in that picture?

845
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:57,171
Probably around my age.

846
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:22,396
"I don't know how I ever
latched on to someone like you,

847
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:27,197
"but I sure hope I can keep
you interested in me forever.

848
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:30,033
I love you and will always be true."

849
01:18:58,033 --> 01:18:59,660
Ha! Found ya.

850
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,566
Found ya!

851
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:51,586
We're goin' to fix your problem for you.

852
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:54,486
Right now I'm feeling
like blowing me a clean hole

853
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:56,456
through your fucking guts.

854
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:57,719
I know you do,

855
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,454
but you won't.

856
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:02,156
You'll put that scatter gun
away and come along with us.

857
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:06,127
You must think I'm crazy.

858
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:09,227
We'll take you to your daddy's bones.

859
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,169
We know the place.

860
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:18,944
We need to put a stop
to all this nonsense talk

861
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:21,983
about us we've been having to hear.

862
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:23,984
I ain't said a thing about you.

863
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:27,180
I know, but everybody else has.

864
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:29,018
I'm bringing this.

865
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:31,354
No, you won't bring that, either.

866
01:20:31,426 --> 01:20:35,192
You want his bones,
you'll set that down and come along.

867
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:07,056
You go on and take that sack off now.

868
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:10,630
Give it to me.

869
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:18,969
Child, you might know where you are.

870
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,065
If you do, you forget you know it.

871
01:21:21,142 --> 01:21:22,541
You get me?

872
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:52,126
He should be right there.

873
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:56,432
You're gonna need to reach down
and tug him up.

874
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:14,955
He ain't deep.

875
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:25,796
Straight down.

876
01:23:25,867 --> 01:23:27,425
Can you feel of him?

877
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,359
All right, now.

878
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:57,489
- Here, take this.
- What?

879
01:23:57,565 --> 01:23:59,965
- How else you gonna get his hands?
- No.

880
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,697
- Oh, come on, child.
- No.

881
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:04,238
Your daddy would want you to do this.

882
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:06,637
Now, here, take the saw.

883
01:24:12,914 --> 01:24:14,575
She can't do it, Merab.

884
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:25,091
Hold his arm out straight, child.

885
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:32,096
Shit.

886
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:05,058
Why'd you let go?

887
01:25:05,133 --> 01:25:06,691
You're gonna need both hands,

888
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:10,226
or sure as shit they'll say he cut one off
to keep from going to prison.

889
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:12,466
They know that trick.
Now reach back down in there, now, quick.

890
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:06,587
There you go.

891
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:18,772
Let's go, Alice.

892
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:37,620
Christian County 136,

893
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:40,957
<i>that thing comes back
to a P.O. Box address out of Cassville.</i>

894
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:44,362
The owner appears to be
a relative of the female

895
01:26:44,432 --> 01:26:46,195
who is taking care of the kids.

896
01:26:46,267 --> 01:26:48,394
Christian County to 160.

897
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:49,834
Got it.

898
01:26:58,046 --> 01:26:59,741
Come on back.

899
01:27:13,361 --> 01:27:14,692
Oh.

900
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:18,922
How in the hell did you come by these?

901
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,935
Someone flung them
up on the porch last night.

902
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:30,568
Reckon I'll run these straight over.

903
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:32,909
The lab can tell me if they're his.

904
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:34,243
They're his.

905
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:37,079
Those are my dad's hands.

906
01:27:37,151 --> 01:27:39,176
We'll know yes or no
on that soon enough.

907
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:45,381
I bet your dad would still be here
if he was just growing his marijuana.

908
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,786
Hey.

909
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:51,764
I didn't shoot the other night
'cause you were there in the truck.

910
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:55,062
He never backed me down.

911
01:27:58,706 --> 01:28:00,867
It looked to me like he did.

912
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:02,967
Don't you let me hear
that's the story getting around.

913
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:07,105
I don't talk about you, man, ever.

914
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:49,680
You're a good boy.

915
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:54,988
Good boy.

916
01:29:04,305 --> 01:29:06,603
Thank you.

917
01:29:06,674 --> 01:29:09,165
Clip. Thank you.

918
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:28,859
Sonny.

919
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:32,029
Hey, Ashlee.

920
01:29:34,302 --> 01:29:36,202
I brung these for you two to raise up.

921
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:44,840
Thank you.

922
01:29:50,918 --> 01:29:52,647
What's he doing here?

923
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,086
I have no idea.

924
01:29:58,259 --> 01:30:00,056
I know you.

925
01:30:00,128 --> 01:30:02,323
Yep.

926
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:05,025
Looks like you earned
this money with blood, kid.

927
01:30:08,536 --> 01:30:11,164
- That's yours.
- How's it mine?

928
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,104
Well, that feller never did give a name,

929
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:18,009
but he sure was good news for you all
when he put that down on Jessup.

930
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:19,273
Ain't it still his, though?

931
01:30:21,182 --> 01:30:23,878
You can use it
a hell of a lot more than him.

932
01:30:23,951 --> 01:30:25,282
He ain't gonna come back for it, neither,

933
01:30:25,353 --> 01:30:27,082
not the way things happened.

934
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:31,956
We took our cut,
and that there's what's left.

935
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:34,221
That makes it yours.

936
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:37,925
I don't know how you did that.

937
01:30:37,999 --> 01:30:40,729
Bred and buttered. I told you.

938
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:44,938
Well, you take care, okay?

939
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:10,294
Here.

940
01:31:10,364 --> 01:31:12,924
Yeah.

941
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,900
Well, it's been a long time.

942
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:20,238
Back off a little.
You're making me nervous.

943
01:31:22,176 --> 01:31:23,575
Oh, shit.

944
01:31:51,372 --> 01:31:53,670
Hm.

945
01:32:00,147 --> 01:32:02,377
I was never good like your daddy was.

946
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,495
I know who.

947
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:19,556
What?

948
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,163
Jessup.

949
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:28,873
I know who.

950
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:35,379
You should have this.

951
01:32:40,588 --> 01:32:42,488
Oh, no, you...

952
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:45,355
Why don't you keep it here for me?

953
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:30,133
Does that money mean you're leaving?

954
01:33:30,204 --> 01:33:32,764
I ain't leaving you guys.
Why do you think that?

955
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:37,210
We heard you talking about the Army.

956
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:45,514
Are you wanting to leave us?

957
01:33:46,821 --> 01:33:49,984
I'd be lost without
the weight of you two on my back.

958
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:54,460
I ain't going anywhere.
