1
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,512
<i>They'd better not push me on him,</i>

2
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,012
<i>or I'll just kick them
in the teeth on it.</i>

3
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,379
<i>Well, I think, if they...</i>

4
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,587
<i>Internal Revenue people that are kicking</i>

5
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:58,249
<i>Billy Graham around is Rosenberg.</i>

6
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,121
<i>He is to be out.</i>

7
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,286
<i>I don't give a goddamn
what the story is.</i>

8
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,920
<i>He went on television.</i>

9
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,728
<i>I have not. I've
already ordered Connally,</i>

10
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,496
<i>we're going after the Chandlers,</i>

11
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,628
<i>every one individually, collectively,</i>

12
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,695
<i>their income taxes
are starting this week.</i>

13
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:16,469
<i>Every one of those sons of bitches.</i>

14
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,643
<i>Well, this is something that
we can really hang Teddy or...</i>

15
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:22,703
<i>Yeah.</i>

16
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:24,079
<i>or the Kennedy clan with.</i>

17
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,414
<i>I'm gonna want to put
that in Colson's hands.</i>

18
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,647
<i>And we're gonna want to run with it.</i>

19
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,855
<i>A controversial day in politics.</i>

20
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,292
<i>A man arrested trying to bug the offices</i>

21
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,023
<i>of the Democratic National
Committee in Washington</i>

22
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,395
<i>turns out to be an employee</i>

23
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,560
<i>of President Richard Nixon's
re-election campaign committee.</i>

24
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:46,036
<i>He is one of five persons
surprised and arrested yesterday</i>

25
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,540
<i>inside the headquarters of the
Democratic National Committee</i>

26
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,802
<i>in Washington.</i>

27
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,366
<i>And guess what else he is.</i>

28
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,412
<i>A consultant of
President Richard Nixon's</i>

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,414
<i>re-election campaign committee.</i>

30
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,473
<i>The trial started today
at the federal courthouse</i>

31
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,177
<i>for the five burglars
caught breaking into</i>

32
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,050
<i>the Democratic National
Party headquarters.</i>

33
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,214
Stand by for camera.

34
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,814
<i>John Dean, the ex-White
House Counsel, testified today</i>

35
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,918
<i>that President Nixon knew
about the Watergate cover-up.</i>

36
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,252
<i>At one point in the conversation,</i>

37
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,764
<i>I recall the President telling me</i>

38
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:16,268
<i>to keep a good list of the
press people giving us trouble</i>

39
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,635
<i>because we will make life difficult
for them after the election.</i>

40
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,470
<i>Dean read through a 245-page statement</i>

41
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,102
<i>characterizing a president
who was easily outraged</i>

42
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,942
<i>over war protesters and
political adversaries,</i>

43
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,845
<i>and outlining a range of offenses,</i>

44
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,679
<i>including wiretapping of newsmen,</i>

45
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,878
<i>a Charles Colson plan to firebomb</i>

46
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,012
<i>and burglarize the
Brookings Institution,</i>

47
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,058
<i>and spying on Senator
Kennedy and other Democrats.</i>

48
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,561
<i>The misuse of power is the
very essence of tyranny.</i>

49
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,688
<i>And consider, if you will,</i>

50
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:48,723
<i>the frightening implications
of that for a free society.</i>

51
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:52,936
<i>The President today accepted the
resignation of three of his closest aides.</i>

52
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,600
<i>Out is H.R. Haldeman, Chief of Staff.</i>

53
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,166
<i>Also quitting under
fire is John Ehrlichman.</i>

54
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,508
<i>Ehrlichman was a key political advisor.</i>

55
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,808
<i>Good morning. The Supreme Court</i>

56
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,508
<i>has just ruled on the tapes controversy,</i>

57
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,915
<i>and here is Carl Stern,
who has that ruling.</i>

58
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,317
<i>It is a unanimous decision,
Doug, eight to zero.</i>

59
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,686
<i>Justice Rehnquist took
no part in the decision</i>

60
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,625
<i>ordering the President of the
United States to turn over the tapes.</i>

61
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,057
<i>It's an eight-to-zero
unanimous opinion.</i>

62
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,861
<i>A White House aide told NBC News today</i>

63
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,629
<i>that impeachment of the President</i>

64
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:26,502
<i>by the full House of Representatives
now is a virtual certainty.</i>

65
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,308
<i>These are, with no serious doubt,</i>

66
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,812
<i>the last hours of the 37th
presidency of the United States.</i>

67
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,279
<i>This is indeed an historic day,</i>

68
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,982
<i>the only time a president
has ever resigned from office</i>

69
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,719
<i>in our nearly 200 years of history.</i>

70
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,694
<i>You see the White House
there, and in the White House,</i>

71
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,093
<i>in just a few moments now,</i>

72
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:54,258
<i>President Nixon will be
appearing before the people,</i>

73
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:58,236
<i>perhaps for the last time as
President of the United States.</i>

74
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,801
15 seconds, Mr. President.

75
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,377
Okay, that's five, four, three...

76
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,349
Good evening. This is the 37th time

77
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,154
I have spoken to you from this office

78
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,787
where so many decisions have been made

79
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,388
that have shaped the
history of our nation.

80
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,457
I remember exactly where I was.

81
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:33,236
My father called. The phone rang,
my father called and he said,

82
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,571
"Turn on the TV right now.
Richard Nixon's going down."

83
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:40,374
I was at home with friends, and we
were watching television at home.

84
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,244
We stayed up and, like
everyone else, I'd been glued to

85
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,807
the Select and Judiciary Committee
hearings night after night.

86
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,012
And then finally, it had come to this.

87
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:53,889
Therefore, I shall resign the
presidency effective at noon tomorrow.

88
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,952
But instead of the satisfaction
I imagined I'd feel,

89
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,294
I just got angrier and angrier,

90
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:02,129
because there was no admission of guilt.

91
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,634
There was no apology.

92
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,102
Little did I know

93
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,298
that I would one day be part of the team

94
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,773
that would try and elicit that apology.

95
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,868
To leave office before
my term is completed

96
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,937
is abhorrent to every
instinct in my body.

97
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,506
I have never been a quitter.

98
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,245
And that that team would be led

99
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,017
by the most unlikely of white knights,

100
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,024
a man with no political
convictions whatsoever,

101
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:30,324
a man who, as far as I know, had
never even voted once in his life.

102
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,260
But he was a man who had one big
advantage over the rest of us.

103
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,834
He understood television.

104
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:50,441
<i>And now, the host of
Frost Over Australia,</i>

105
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,144
<i>Mr. David Frost!</i>

106
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,014
Thank you, thank you.

107
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,417
Hello. Good evening.

108
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,621
And with the eyes of the world
focused on the White House,

109
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,324
here in Australia,
burglars have broken into

110
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,731
a meat factory in Brisbane

111
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,634
and stolen a ton of pork sausages.

112
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:17,536
The Queensland police are looking
for men in a long, thin getaway car.

113
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,275
Now, my first guest tonight...

114
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,508
Well, we in the Nixon camp

115
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,050
really didn't know that
much about David Frost,

116
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,110
other than he was a
British talk show host

117
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,950
with something of a playboy reputation.

118
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:33,753
He'd had a talk show here in
the US that had won some awards

119
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:38,923
but hadn't syndicated well and
had been dropped by the network.

120
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,488
He ended up taking it down to Australia,

121
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:44,297
which is, I believe, where he
was when the President resigned.

122
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,061
Next week's guest will
be Evonne Goolagong.

123
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,040
We'll see you then. God bless.

124
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,539
Great show, David. Thanks, Noah.

125
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,807
Come and look at this.

126
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,007
Nixon leaving the White House.

127
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,812
<i>A dark day for Richard
Nixon, who has drawn crowds</i>

128
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,250
<i>to the vast Ellipse south
of the White House before.</i>

129
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,843
What, this is live? Yeah.

130
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,583
<i>But those were triumphs. This is not.</i>

131
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,148
What time is it in Washington?

132
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,659
9:00 a.m.

133
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,854
Why didn't he wait?

134
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,396
It's 6:00 in the morning
on the West Coast.

135
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,557
Half his audience is still asleep.

136
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,934
All right, you blokes, let's
get the set broken down.

137
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:22,065
<i>are witnesses to the saddest
day in the life of Richard Nixon,</i>

138
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:26,077
<i>his last moments as President
of the United States,</i>

139
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,774
<i>a moment unlike any other in
the history of this country.</i>

140
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,631
<i>Richard Nixon, who goes now</i>

141
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,965
<i>from the power of the presidency</i>

142
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,267
<i>to a form of exile in California.</i>

143
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,137
Find out the numbers for
this, will you? Worldwide.

144
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,522
<i>I remember his face.</i>

145
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,357
<i>Staring out the window.</i>

146
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:20,092
<i>Down below him, a liberal
America cheered, gloated.</i>

147
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,326
Hippies, draft dodgers, dilettantes,

148
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,770
the same people who'd spit on
me when I got back from Vietnam.

149
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:32,968
They'd gotten rid of Richard
Nixon, their bogeyman.

150
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,684
So what's so important that it
couldn't wait, that it had to be today?

151
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:53,198
I've had an idea, John, rather
a bold idea for an interview.

152
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,733
Fish and chips, please.

153
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,199
And in a moment...

154
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,634
Well, it's too late now. It's done.

155
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,034
I've called his people...

156
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,265
You?

157
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,705
Beans, peas and lamb, please.

158
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,242
And made an offer.

159
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,770
Now, if the subject were to say yes,

160
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:16,144
well, he's rather a big fish
that swims in not-untricky waters.

161
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:20,422
So it goes without saying
that I'd want a dear friend

162
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,326
and the finest producer
I know by my side.

163
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,661
So who is it?

164
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,867
Richard Nixon.

165
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,600
Richard Nixon?

166
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,075
Well, come on, don't look like that.

167
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,805
Well, how would you expect me to look?

168
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,144
I spent yesterday evening watching
you interview the Bee Gees.

169
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,080
Weren't they terrific?

170
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:49,144
Come on, John, we've done
political interviews before.

171
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,914
So, okay, so what kind of interview?

172
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:58,225
A full, extensive look-back
over his life, his presidency.

173
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,855
And?

174
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,365
And what? Come on, David.

175
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,901
Surely the only thing
that would interest anyone

176
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,301
about Richard Nixon
would be a confession.

177
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,134
A full, no-holds-barred
confession.

178
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,436
Well, we'll get that, too.

179
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,497
From Richard Nixon?

180
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:11,907
Come on, John.

181
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,276
Just think of the numbers it would get.

182
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,675
Do you know how many people watched

183
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,376
his farewell speech in the White House?

184
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,476
Four hundred million.

185
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,845
But in the end, David heard nothing.

186
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,584
And soon after arriving in California,

187
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:29,253
Nixon was rushed to hospital
with an acute attack of phlebitis.

188
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,142
<i>I think it was around
this time that Gerald Ford,</i>

189
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,235
who was the new President,

190
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,371
and who was desperate to move
the agenda on from Watergate,

191
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,541
gave Nixon a full, free
and absolute pardon.

192
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,347
<i>Now therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,</i>

193
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,082
<i>President of the United States,</i>

194
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:01,092
<i>have granted, and by
these presents do grant,</i>

195
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,685
<i>a full, free and absolute pardon</i>

196
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:08,962
<i>unto Richard Nixon for all
offenses against the United States.</i>

197
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,435
It meant that the man who had
committed the greatest felony

198
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,166
in American political history
would never stand trial.

199
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,640
It was like he slipped
out the back door.

200
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,640
<i>A public opinion poll indicates</i>

201
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:23,079
<i>a two-to-one disapproval of
the pardoning of Richard Nixon.</i>

202
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,346
<i>One telegram from Virginia said,
"Roosevelt had his New Deal,</i>

203
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:30,014
<i>"Truman had his Fair Deal, now
Ford has his crooked deal. "</i>

204
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,080
<i>There was no deal, period.</i>

205
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,524
<i>I don't think the truth
will ever come out.</i>

206
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,254
<i>The American people
need to know the truth,</i>

207
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,559
<i>and I don't think it will
ever now be fully known.</i>

208
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,521
So how do we want to
address the college protests?

209
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:06,785
Well, do we want to lift some quotes

210
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,987
from the "stand up and be
counted" speech in 1970?

211
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,689
Sir? You know, maybe
we're just better off

212
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,288
using the whole Lincoln Memorial memo.

213
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:14,832
Just include the whole thing.

214
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,368
Mr. President, Swifty Lazar is here.

215
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,700
Okay. No, no, stick around.

216
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,967
You're gonna get a kick out of this.

217
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,272
This is my literary
agent from Hollywood.

218
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,539
Hygiene obsessive.

219
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,009
Mr. President, good to see you.

220
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,712
Nice to see you.

221
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,381
These are folks helping me with my book.

222
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:40,357
Diane Sawyer, Frank
Gannon, Irving Lazar.

223
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,984
Nice to meet you. Miss Sawyer.

224
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,790
Pleasure. Mr. Gannon.

225
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,725
Okay, that's it. I'll
see you after lunch.

226
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,793
So how you feeling, sir?

227
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:56,766
I'm better, thank you. Though
not yet well enough to golf,

228
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,477
thank God. I despise that game.

229
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,005
Imagine, six weeks out of office

230
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,608
as President of the United States,

231
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,552
and they'd have me putting
in my hospital room.

232
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,613
Never retire, Mr. Lazar.

233
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:16,994
To me, the unhappiest people
of the world are retired.

234
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,859
No purpose.

235
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,695
What makes life mean
something is purpose.

236
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,668
A goal. A battle. A struggle.

237
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,967
Well, even if you don't win it.

238
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,964
When my doctor declared me unfit

239
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,873
to give testimony in
the Watergate trial,

240
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:34,174
everybody thought I'd be relieved.

241
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,838
Well, they were wrong.

242
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,439
That was the lowest I got.

243
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:41,953
Well, if it's a challenge you
want, here's one you might enjoy.

244
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,957
How to spend $2 million,
2.3 to be precise.

245
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,822
It's what I got for your memoirs.

246
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,360
Well, thank you.

247
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:50,690
Eh...

248
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,526
It might be a little
short of what I wanted,

249
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:56,159
but let me assure you, it's a
whole lot more than they wanted.

250
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,260
That book is important to me.

251
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,034
It's probably the only chance I'm
gonna get to put the record straight

252
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:05,474
and remind people the
Nixon years weren't all bad.

253
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,848
You know, if you're trying
to put the record straight,

254
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,383
I'd at least talk to him.

255
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:13,577
Who?

256
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,352
David Frost. English talk show guy.

257
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,991
Why would I want to talk to David Frost?

258
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,858
Well, a while back, he wrote
asking for an interview.

259
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,260
No.

260
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,662
Well, we didn't get back to him.

261
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,064
Frankly, we didn't find him appropriate.

262
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,898
Well, I thought that we
were doing one with CBS.

263
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,939
We are. I just figured
doing it with Frost

264
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,133
would be a whole lot easier
than doing it with Mike Wallace.

265
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:40,542
It would, but it would have a
lot less, you know, credibility.

266
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:44,140
True, true. Could
probably get more money.

267
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,715
Really? Look.

268
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:52,188
We'll always have 350
on the table from CBS.

269
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,989
But if I could get Frost to pay
more and secure better terms,

270
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,588
it might be a shame to pass.

271
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,361
It'd be interesting to
know where he is right now.

272
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:05,395
We tied him to railway
tracks, and he escaped.

273
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,736
We buried him alive, and he walked free.

274
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:13,210
Today we're lowering escape artist
Derek Harrison into the water

275
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,613
to see if he can miraculously
cheat death once more.

276
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,117
<i>Good evening, and
welcome to Great Escapes.</i>

277
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,119
My name is David Frost.

278
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,748
Okay, that is a cut.

279
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:26,916
Thank you.

280
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:30,291
In any deal, you need to know
your opponent's breaking point.

281
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,392
To assess that, you might call them

282
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,695
late at night or at the weekend.

283
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,168
If they take the call,
you know they're desperate.

284
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,674
And from that moment on, you
know you have the upper hand.

285
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:54,912
Hello?

286
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,682
<i>Mr. Frost? Irving Lazar.</i>

287
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,547
Who?

288
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,788
Swifty Lazar. I
represent President Nixon.

289
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,158
What time is it?

290
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,196
<i>Bad time?</i>

291
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,062
No! Not at all.

292
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,970
I'm calling with regard to
your request for an interview

293
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,032
and to say, having considered it,

294
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,103
my client is not necessarily
opposed to the idea.

295
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,912
Really? Well, that's terrific news!

296
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,714
For God's sake.

297
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,845
<i>I got $500,000.</i>

298
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,321
Is that good?

299
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,020
Mr. President, it's a half a
million dollars for a news interview.

300
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,357
It's unprecedented.

301
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,624
Yeah? Well, what's the catch?

302
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,861
<i>With Frost? None.
It'll be a big wet kiss.</i>

303
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,063
This guy'll be so grateful
to be getting it at all,

304
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,833
he'll pitch puffballs all night

305
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,739
and pay a half a million
dollars for the privilege.

306
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,479
Well, you think you could get 550?

307
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,114
I got 6.

308
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:02,684
David, how could you
have done that? What?

309
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,689
$600,000. That's a fortune.

310
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,746
200 on signature?

311
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,291
Don't worry about the money.

312
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,725
My God. Most Americans
think he belongs in jail.

313
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,490
You're making him a rich man.

314
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,497
Plus, by outbidding them,
you've already made enemies

315
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,055
of the networks. They're just jealous.

316
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,659
They're already sounding off
about checkbook journalism.

317
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,169
And if the networks are against you,

318
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,637
syndication's always
going to be a struggle.

319
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,264
No syndication, no advance sales.

320
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,865
No advance sales, no commercials.

321
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,375
No commercials, no revenue.

322
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:29,107
And here's the bigger question,
why do it? You don't need it.

323
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,307
Your career's in great shape.

324
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,543
This will just spread you
across three continents,

325
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,210
jeopardize the other shows.

326
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,685
Isn't it true that
Channel Nine in Australia

327
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,449
want you to do another season
of your talk show for them?

328
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,581
Yes. And London, too?

329
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,784
Yes, but that would be
London and Australia.

330
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,622
This would be... What?

331
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,718
You wouldn't understand, John.

332
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,630
You were never part of
the show in New York,

333
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,064
but it's indescribable.

334
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:55,198
Success in America is
unlike success anywhere else.

335
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,667
And the emptiness when it's gone.

336
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:05,517
And the sickening thought
that it may never come back.

337
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,818
You know, there's a restaurant
in New York called Sardi's.

338
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,650
Ordinary mortals can't get a table.

339
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,417
John, the place was my canteen!

340
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,583
You know, I'd be happier

341
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:14,887
if I heard some kind of vision

342
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,120
that you had for this interview.

343
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,355
Excuse me, Mr. Frost.

344
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,555
I'd heard you were going to be here.

345
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,564
Would you mind? Of course.

346
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,122
But I don't. I just hear a man doing it

347
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,463
because it would create headlines

348
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,628
or give him a place at the top table.

349
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,069
And that is what makes me nervous.

350
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,869
And you do nervous so beautifully, John.

351
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,241
"Hello, good evening and welcome."

352
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,382
I don't actually say that.

353
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,008
Hello, Mr. Frost.

354
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,820
Champagne?

355
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,588
No, thank you.

356
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,655
Another glass, sir?

357
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,343
You don't like champagne?

358
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,377
Not on airplanes.

359
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,752
Yes, it dehydrates one terribly.

360
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,252
The trick is to have a glass
of water on the go, too.

361
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,851
Like the Viennese serve coffee.

362
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,193
Well, I've never been to Vienna.

363
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,733
Oh. Well, you'd like it.

364
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,826
It's like Paris without the French.

365
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,398
What's your name?

366
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,669
Caroline.

367
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:38,767
David.

368
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,540
Yes, I know. David Frost.

369
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,346
"Hello and good evening and welcome."

370
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,785
You know, I heard an interview
with you recently on the radio.

371
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,191
You were giving it from the
back of your Rolls-Royce.

372
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,387
Bentley.

373
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,520
On the phone.

374
00:19:58,597 --> 00:19:59,859
They said that you were a person

375
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,958
who defined the age we live in.

376
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,627
Really? Mmm.

377
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,762
You and Vidal Sassoon.

378
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,442
But what made you
exceptional, they said,

379
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,446
was that you were a person
who had achieved great fame

380
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,881
without possessing any
discernible quality.

381
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,179
How kind. Mmm-hmm.

382
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:23,551
And that you fly around a great deal.

383
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,920
Well, that's true.

384
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:27,814
Why?

385
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,383
I like to keep busy.

386
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,427
Why?

387
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,056
I find it more interesting
than keeping still.

388
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,067
You know, you have very sad eyes.

389
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,566
Do I? Mmm.

390
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,629
Has anyone told you that before?

391
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,436
No.

392
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,169
Are you a sad person?

393
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,607
Let's talk about you a little bit.

394
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,174
Of course, you feel more
comfortable asking questions.

395
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,187
How right you are!

396
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,250
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

397
00:20:58,323 --> 00:20:59,312
<i>You may have noticed we've begun</i>

398
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,518
<i>our final descent into Los Angeles.</i>

399
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,487
<i>If you could please return to your
seats and fasten your seat belts,</i>

400
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,623
<i>we'll be landing very
shortly. Thank you.</i>

401
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,997
So how about you? Where are you going?

402
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,434
To meet Richard Nixon.

403
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:13,732
Really?

404
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,205
You know, they say he has
the most enormous head,

405
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,235
but the sexiest voice.

406
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,677
Where is he now?

407
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:25,474
In some dark underground
cave licking his wounds?

408
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,115
Actually, no. In his
rather smart beachside villa

409
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,245
in California.

410
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,052
Really? Richard Nixon
in a beachside villa?

411
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,717
How incongruous.

412
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,761
You can come if you'd like.

413
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,923
To meet Nixon?

414
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,360
Why not?

415
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,031
Are you sure?

416
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:48,767
You know, I would love that.

417
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,001
<i>Cabin crew, please prepare for arrival.</i>

418
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,943
Well, I'll get my office to call
you first thing in the morning

419
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,572
and send a car with a phone.

420
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,637
Oh.

421
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,145
He did, too. Money no object.

422
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:07,214
Everything glittered and was golden.

423
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,759
Well, on the outside.

424
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,660
<i>Of course, what I didn't
know was that in the meantime,</i>

425
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,891
<i>he'd gone to all the major networks</i>

426
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,433
<i>to try and get interest
in the interviews.</i>

427
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,835
I'm sorry, David, but we have a policy

428
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,339
of not paying for a news interview.

429
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:25,570
Look, we love your
work as an entertainer.

430
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,770
<i>That Guinness show?</i>

431
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,335
Love it. You're a funny guy.

432
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,608
But an interview like this?

433
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,583
You're asking us to pay
a British talk show host

434
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,882
to interview an American president

435
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,617
with absolutely no editorial
controls whatsoever in return?

436
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,659
Well, you can't say it's
not a fresh approach.

437
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,456
I know you're very busy.

438
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,529
I'm not gonna keep you from it.

439
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,756
Thank you for coming in.

440
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,926
I'm gonna have to get back to you.

441
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,868
Okay, thank you so much for your time.

442
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:53,996
David, good luck.

443
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,438
He never let on to anyone at the time,

444
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,702
not even me. You know,
that would have meant...

445
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,599
Thanks.

446
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:03,239
<i>... admitting failure, and
David doesn't do failure.</i>

447
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,280
There you are.

448
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,839
See, you don't have
to do a thing yourself.

449
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,262
Well.

450
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,065
You found it okay.

451
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,265
Yes, thank you.

452
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,500
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Frost.

453
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,667
And you, sir.

454
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,267
May I present Caroline Cushing?

455
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:07,402
Miss Cushing.

456
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,572
Hello. Your house is very beautiful.

457
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:10,808
Really. Very romantic.

458
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:11,974
Well, thank you.

459
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,881
And my producer, John Birt.

460
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,476
Nice to meet you. How do you do?

461
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,990
This is Mr. Lazar, and
this is Jack Brennan.

462
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,389
Now, Miss Cushing, would
you like to take a tour,

463
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,758
you know, maybe stretch your
legs after your long journey?

464
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,491
Yes, please. I'd love that. Thank you.

465
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,591
Come on in. This is my office.

466
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:33,798
Now, this is where Brezhnev
and I had our summit.

467
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:38,241
Yeah. Brezhnev was there, and
Gromyko there, Dobrynin there.

468
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,402
We talked for nine hours straight.

469
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:47,107
After the meeting, as
a souvenir of the visit,

470
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:51,451
I remember that we had
a Lincoln specially made.

471
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,720
Dark blue, cherry wood, leather.

472
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:57,455
Well, we got inside
for the photographers,

473
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:01,795
when the next thing you
know, he steps on the gas.

474
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:06,600
Now, the first rule of political life is

475
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:11,108
you never let a president get
behind the wheel of a car, ever.

476
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,167
I mean, we're not used to doing anything

477
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,213
for ourselves, let alone drive.

478
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,477
And the Chairman, Jesus,
the way he put his foot down,

479
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,314
my guess is the last thing he drove was

480
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:24,412
a tractor on some Ukrainian potato farm.

481
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:27,882
He crashed into curbs.

482
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,449
He went over speed bumps.

483
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,429
He went twice around my whole estate.

484
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:37,298
Finally, we ended up at some
remote point on the coast,

485
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,304
out there overlooking the sea.

486
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:44,570
He turns off the gas,
and he talks for two hours

487
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:48,101
about his favorite subject, steel mills.

488
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,943
He said, "Mr. President,
most politicians

489
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,746
"have tragedy in their early lives."

490
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:58,851
Well, I told him that I lost
two brothers to tuberculosis.

491
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:03,918
And he watched his father die from
the cancer he caught in the steelworks.

492
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:09,198
He was a sad man and a noble adversary.

493
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,234
I wouldn't want to be a Russian leader.

494
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,103
They never know when
they're being taped.

495
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,543
Okay, I guess that's it then, huh?

496
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,411
Until March. I look forward to it.

497
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,347
Well, thank you, Mr. President. So do I.

498
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,045
You know, it's a funny thing that

499
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:31,816
I've never been challenged
to a duel before.

500
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,152
I guess that's what this is.

501
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,158
Yeah, well, not really.

502
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,819
Of course it is.

503
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,626
And I like that.

504
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,870
No holds barred, eh? No holds barred.

505
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:54,906
Mr. Frost, there's still
the small matter of the...

506
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,676
Of course.

507
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,585
I do beg your pardon.

508
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:17,163
Right. $200,000.

509
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:20,402
I do hope that isn't coming
out of your own pocket.

510
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,566
Well, believe me, sir, I wish
my pockets were that deep.

511
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,271
Made out in the name of?

512
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:27,470
Irving Paul Lazar.

513
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:29,376
Richard M. Nixon.

514
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,516
Here you go.

515
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,690
Okay, smile.

516
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:47,327
There. Now you can put that
in your apartment in New York,

517
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,960
and all your liberal friends
can use it as a dartboard.

518
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:54,733
Well, actually, I'm living
in Monte Carlo at the moment.

519
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,205
Really?

520
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,105
Yes. Goodbye, Mr. President.

521
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:02,579
Hey. Take my advice.

522
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,205
You should marry that woman.

523
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,513
Yes. Lovely, isn't she?

524
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,554
More important than that,
she comes from Monaco.

525
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,647
They pay no taxes there.

526
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,892
Bye-bye. Goodbye.

527
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,030
I bet you it did.

528
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,128
What?

529
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,604
Come out of his own pocket.

530
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,800
You know, he couldn't
look me in the eye.

531
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,502
Well, I hear the networks aren't biting.

532
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,670
Without the networks, the ad
agencies don't want to know.

533
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:35,974
So if you ask me, there's a good chance

534
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,207
this whole thing may never happen.

535
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:42,481
Really? So that meeting we just
had might have cost him $200,000?

536
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,646
Correct.

537
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,980
Had I known that, I would
have offered him a cup of tea.

538
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,860
Say, did you notice his shoes?

539
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:51,953
No.

540
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,522
Italian. No laces. What do you think?

541
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,734
My people tried to get me
to wear a pair like that.

542
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:01,363
I think a man's shoes
should have laces, sir.

543
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,597
You do?

544
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:06,235
Yeah. Personally, I find those
Italian shoes very effeminate.

545
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,371
Yes, quite right.

546
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,377
<i>I'm sorry, David, but it's a no.</i>

547
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,181
<i>Try to look at it
from our point of view.</i>

548
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,189
<i>Why would an American
network hire a total outsider,</i>

549
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,522
and someone who's already had his
own show canceled, incidentally?

550
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,118
I see. Well, I'm sorry
you feel this way.

551
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:27,062
Obviously, I think you're
making a terrible mistake.

552
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,032
NBC.

553
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,531
Well, that's the
networks out, all of them.

554
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,202
Well, that's the end of that, then.

555
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,180
I'm sorry, David.

556
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:49,649
Not so fast.

557
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:53,580
Where's your adventurer's spirit?

558
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,626
The idea is we pay for the program

559
00:29:55,693 --> 00:30:00,721
and syndicate it ourselves,
completely bypassing the networks.

560
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,393
Just imagine it, we'd be our
own network for the night.

561
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,368
Hey, Bob. How does that grab you?

562
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,301
Hey, come on in. David's on the phone.

563
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,203
No, never been done before.

564
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:10,866
Historic stuff.

565
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,339
Just think about it,
okay? And call me back.

566
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,472
Yeah? Yeah.

567
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:22,577
David, I'd like you to meet
Jim Reston and Bob Zelnick,

568
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,848
our two prospective corner men.

569
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,014
Delighted to meet you.

570
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,886
Come on in. Make yourselves at home.

571
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,289
Bob's been Washington correspondent

572
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,656
for Public Radio for the past 10 years.

573
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,922
Moving to ABC in the new year.

574
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,327
The general feeling, David,

575
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:37,198
is that I have been wasting
my matinee idol looks on radio.

576
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,827
Jim here teaches at the
University of North Carolina

577
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:43,738
and is writing a book about the
criminal dishonesty, corruption,

578
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,876
paranoia and abuses of
power of Richard Nixon.

579
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,412
Second on the subject.

580
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:49,537
Fourth.

581
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,673
Well, delighted to have you both aboard.

582
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:54,183
Actually, before I sign
on, I would like to hear

583
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:57,119
what you were hoping to
achieve with this interview.

584
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:59,713
What I want to achieve?

585
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,053
Yeah.

586
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:05,223
Jim, well, I've secured 12 taping days.

587
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,230
That's close to 30 hours

588
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,493
with the most compelling
and controversial politician

589
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,330
of our times.

590
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:12,869
Isn't that enough?

591
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,103
Well, not for me.

592
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,775
Look, I'd be giving up a year
of my life. I'm leaving my family

593
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:23,507
to work on a subject
matter that means more

594
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,276
than you can probably imagine,

595
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,442
and the idea of doing all that

596
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:29,953
without achieving what
I want to, personally,

597
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,784
would be unthinkable to me.

598
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,084
No, all right.

599
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,521
Well, what is it that
you want to achieve?

600
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:45,135
I'd like to give Richard
Nixon the trial he never had.

601
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,468
Of course, we'll be
asking difficult questions.

602
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,200
Difficult questions.

603
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,337
The man lost 21,000 Americans

604
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,845
and a million Indo-Chinese
during his administration.

605
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,712
He only escaped jail
because of Ford's pardon.

606
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:02,082
Yes, but equally, going after
him in some knee-jerk way,

607
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:05,680
you know, assuming he's a terrible guy,

608
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,454
wouldn't that only create more
sympathy for him than anything else?

609
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,994
You know...

610
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,994
Right now, I submit it's impossible

611
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:18,558
to feel anything close to
sympathy for Richard Nixon.

612
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,763
He devalued the presidency,

613
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:24,433
and he left the country
that elected him in trauma.

614
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:29,273
The American people need a
conviction, pure and simple.

615
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,043
The integrity of our political system,

616
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:37,952
of democracy as an idea,
entirely depends on it.

617
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:40,320
And if in years to
come, people look back

618
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:41,790
and say it was in this interview

619
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,451
that Richard Nixon exonerated himself,

620
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,723
that would be the worst crime of all.

621
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,500
Did you know that Mike Wallace
is doing a piece on this?

622
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:03,141
And that in the bars around
Capitol Hill and Georgetown

623
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,977
this entire project is a joke?

624
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,711
Come on. Jim, come on.

625
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:10,117
Thanks for that, Jim.

626
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,487
Could you give us a couple of minutes?

627
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,222
You're unbelievable. I'm sorry, Bob.

628
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,530
You know, Jim, I went
way out on a limb for you.

629
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,194
I mean, some of us
actually want this job.

630
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,760
I want it, too, if it's done right.

631
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,636
Well, how do you know
they're not gonna do it right?

632
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:30,935
Little Lord Fauntleroy in there?

633
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,203
Sympathy for Richard Nixon?

634
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,903
What the... He's full of shit, man!

635
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,502
How do you know that?

636
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,684
Is Mike Wallace doing a piece on this?

637
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:42,977
Apparently.

638
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,681
Why didn't you tell me?

639
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:46,822
It isn't relevant.

640
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:51,656
What's the angle?
"British talk show host,

641
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:56,161
"good with actresses, not so good
with stonewalling presidents."

642
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,264
That's the general idea, yeah.

643
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,530
Right.

644
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,502
It's hard not to feel a
little insulted by that.

645
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,677
Well, Bob's obviously a pro.

646
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:08,939
What are we gonna do about Reston?

647
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,571
Well, the man's an
idiot. He's overemotional.

648
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:11,910
Send him home.

649
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,285
Well, I think he should stay. Why?

650
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,652
I liked his passion.

651
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,714
He will drive us all bloody mad.

652
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,989
Well, maybe, but sometimes
being out of your comfort zone

653
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,724
is a good thing, I'm told.

654
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,027
He stays.

655
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:43,740
<i>I took my seat next to Mrs.
Mao at the banquet table.</i>

656
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:49,081
<i>Now, one of the challenges
of life as a president</i>

657
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:56,716
<i>is the endless round of cocktail
parties, social engagements, banquets.</i>

658
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,453
<i>And people who know me would tell you</i>

659
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:03,762
<i>that small talk is not one of
my strong suits, either. No.</i>

660
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,529
<i>Particularly not in Mandarin.</i>

661
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:15,535
<i>So Mrs. Mao and I, we just, well,
you know, stared at one another.</i>

662
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:20,981
<i>And then across the table, Mrs.
Nixon and Chairman Mao himself, well,</i>

663
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:24,185
<i>they stared at one another, too.</i>

664
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:27,122
<i>And then further down, Dr. Kissinger</i>

665
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:30,024
<i>and their foreign minister, well,</i>

666
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,554
<i>you're getting the picture now.</i>

667
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,204
I can't stand it, Jack!

668
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:46,671
Reducing the presidency to
a series of banal anecdotes.

669
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:49,677
I feel like a circus
animal doing tricks.

670
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,644
And I thought I made it clear!

671
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:56,244
I didn't want to take any
questions on Watergate, damn it!

672
00:35:57,688 --> 00:36:00,054
Soon as it came to question time,

673
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:04,754
all those sons of bitches ever
want to hear about is Watergate!

674
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:09,322
It's as if all my other
achievements have ceased to exist.

675
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,662
Well, sir, you're gonna get a chance

676
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,032
to talk about them
sooner than you think.

677
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,764
Yeah? How?

678
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,238
Frost got there. He got the money.

679
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:18,941
What?

680
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,477
I understand most of it's borrowed,

681
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:22,308
that his friends have bailed him out.

682
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,575
But the point is, we start
taping at the end of March.

683
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,379
Really? Now, that's terrific.

684
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,214
How much time is devoted to Watergate?

685
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,154
25%. Just one of four 90-minute shows.

686
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,214
What are the other three divided into?

687
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,317
Domestic Affairs, Foreign Policy,

688
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:37,452
and Nixon the Man.

689
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,517
"Nixon the Man"?

690
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,757
As opposed to what? Nixon the horse?

691
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,994
Well, I imagine it's some
kind of biographical piece.

692
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:49,930
I can see it now. The father that
neglected me, the brothers that died.

693
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,066
Spare me.

694
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:57,206
Still, now, the fact it's come
together, now, that's a good thing, no?

695
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:00,512
Mr. President, it's fantastic.

696
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,883
Frost is just not in your
intellectual class, sir.

697
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:06,412
You're gonna be able to dictate
terms, rebuild your reputation.

698
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:11,427
If this went well, if enough people
saw it, revised their opinion,

699
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:14,760
you could move back East way,
way earlier than we expected.

700
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:16,697
You think? I'm certain.

701
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:24,300
It would be so good to go
back to where the action is.

702
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,672
You know?

703
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,270
The hunger in my belly
is still there, Jack.

704
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:35,277
I guess it all boils
down to Watergate, huh?

705
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,015
Well, that's nothing
to worry about, sir.

706
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,819
It's not as if there's
gonna be any revelations.

707
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,621
That stuff's been combed
over a million times.

708
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,992
No one has pinned anything on you.

709
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:48,531
Yeah, still, it's been a while

710
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,123
since I spoke about it on the record.

711
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,964
I'm gonna start doing my homework.

712
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,766
Hey, you know what would be an
interesting thing to find out?

713
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:55,931
What his strategy is.

714
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,065
Now, where's he staying?

715
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:58,665
I believe The Beverly Hilton.

716
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,267
The Beverly Hilton, you say.

717
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,778
Well, I got the numbers someplace

718
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,247
of some fellows that we could send in.

719
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,910
Cubans with CIA training.

720
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,328
Jesus, Jack, it was a joke.

721
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,229
Yes, sir.

722
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,094
<i>A week later, we said
goodbye to our families,</i>

723
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:30,265
<i>we hopped on a plane, and we
moved into The Beverly Hilton.</i>

724
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,332
<i>And that's where we started
to dig into our research</i>

725
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,935
<i>and prepare for the interviews.</i>

726
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,107
Yeah, as it happens, we took

727
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,342
the whole question of
security very seriously.

728
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:45,120
<i>And from day one, we kept all
our files in a locked safe.</i>

729
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:52,124
Who was the guy that Mike
interviewed? Was that Haldeman?

730
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:53,788
Haldeman. Haldeman. And Ehrlichman, too.

731
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:56,355
I always get the Germans mixed up.

732
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,028
I'm a little confused by that.

733
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,867
What is Haldeman's
official... Hello, darling.

734
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,634
As for the work over the months,
we divided it into three sections.

735
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:09,271
Birt took Vietnam, Bob took
Foreign and Domestic Policy,

736
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,510
and I got Watergate
and the abuses of power.

737
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,483
<i>And David, we never
really saw much of David.</i>

738
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,043
All right, so what
about the Huston Plan?

739
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,952
You can see the seeds of dirty tricks.

740
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,424
Essentially, it's an attempt
to legalize dirty tricks.

741
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,620
That's why you gotta get David
to put it in the question.

742
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:25,787
Wiretapping students.

743
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,296
<i>But they've traced the money to him.</i>

744
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,889
Opening people's mail.

745
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:29,990
What about wiretapping?

746
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,056
How many people has he wiretapped?

747
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,399
This guy wiretapped 17 people.

748
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,529
Seventeen?

749
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:35,629
Including his own brother.

750
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,606
But you know what? We can't
ask him about his brother,

751
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,473
'cause frankly, if Donald
Nixon was my brother,

752
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,637
I'd wiretap him, too.

753
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:47,009
But wait, okay, so we
have breaking and entering.

754
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:50,742
We have wiretapping, conspiracy
to foster prostitution.

755
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,083
And that's Liddy, right?

756
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,420
Delivery courtesy of Nate 'n Al's

757
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,220
finest deli selection.

758
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,818
We're going to need napkins.
We'd better have some napkins.

759
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,761
How do we frame a
question about Cambodia,

760
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:01,855
about the illicit bombing of Cambodia?

761
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:02,921
I think you should say,

762
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,627
"How far do you take executive privilege

763
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,363
"before it becomes an
undemocratic event?"

764
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,701
I think you frame the
question to him as a Quaker.

765
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:12,470
"How do you feel as a Quaker about
annihilating an entire people?"

766
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,574
Come on. Are they really
interested in buying time?

767
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,241
Are they going to give us the money?

768
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,841
How serious are they?

769
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:25,411
You have to set up that he has
an anti-democratic personality.

770
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,150
There's a reason they
call him Tricky Dick.

771
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:30,751
Because I had written about
and watched Nixon for years,

772
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,955
I got to play him in our rehearsals.

773
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,089
<i>You know, the fellas
would throw me a question,</i>

774
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,067
<i>and I would try and anticipate
what his response might be.</i>

775
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,160
Okay, the White House taping system.

776
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:43,570
Ours is not the first
administration to use taping systems.

777
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,472
Lyndon Johnson's White House
used them. So did Kennedy's.

778
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:48,171
Huston Plan. Wiretapping
and alleged abuses of power.

779
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:52,113
Let me tell you, other
administrations were up to far worse.

780
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,512
And just for fun, your
close friend Jack Kennedy.

781
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,781
That man, he screwed
anything that moved,

782
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,551
fixed elections and
took us into Vietnam.

783
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,923
And the American people,
they loved him for it!

784
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,929
Whereas I, Richard Milhous Nixon,

785
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:10,899
worked around the clock in
their service, and they hated me!

786
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:15,327
Look. Look. Now I'm sweating.

787
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,840
Damn it! Damn it!

788
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:21,002
And Kennedy's so goddamn
handsome and blue-eyed!

789
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,568
And women all over him!

790
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,944
He screwed anything that
moved, and everything.

791
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,277
Had a go at Checkers once.

792
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,750
The poor little bitch
was never the same!

793
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:34,524
Gentlemen, finally a friend
in the American press.

794
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,254
<i>Jack Anderson in The Washington Post,</i>

795
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,660
"When Richard Nixon faces
the television cameras

796
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,494
"for his first interview since
he abandoned the White House,

797
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:45,967
"he'll be cross-examined as if
he were on the witness stand.

798
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:49,267
"Frost has hired three

00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,001
"to help him with the research.

800
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:54,306
"Clearly the famous TV
interviewer will pull no punches."

801
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:55,811
"Crack investigators"?

802
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,938
Can I be Crack One?

803
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,481
Can I be Deep Crack?

804
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,516
David, can I talk to you for a sec?

805
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:03,985
After researching my last book,

806
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:05,385
I was pretty certain Colson...

807
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,788
You know, Charles Colson?
His darkest henchman?

808
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,155
Colson, right. Colson
had a meeting with Nixon

809
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:11,453
sometime before June 23,

810
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,962
but I never knew the exact date,

811
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,725
so I couldn't find the transcript.

812
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,993
But if you gave me a week back in
the Federal Courthouse library...

813
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:20,730
A week? Goodness, Jim, we
can't lose you for that long.

814
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,203
I think this is really good stuff, Dave.

815
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,241
Would there be something
I could help you with?

816
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,776
You know, if we're gonna nail
Nixon in these interviews,

817
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,243
we're gonna have to ambush him.

818
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:29,677
We're gonna have to
take him by surprise.

819
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,942
Don't worry, Jim. We'll get him anyway.

820
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,576
Hang on a second. David, Jack Brennan.

821
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,142
He sounds a little emotional.

822
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,687
I'll take it in here.

823
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,655
He'll be right with you. Yeah.

824
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,485
<i>Jack. Watergate.</i>

825
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,654
Yes, Jack.

826
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:49,324
Our lawyers want us to agree
on a definition of the word.

827
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,265
Well, I believe it's a large hotel

828
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,462
and office complex in Washington, Jack.

829
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:54,595
<i>You know what I'm talking about.</i>

830
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,139
<i>For the interviews.</i>

831
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,273
We want to propose that Watergate

832
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,867
be an umbrella term
for everything negative.

833
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,145
Hold on a minute.

834
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:10,848
So all the other domestic charges

835
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,286
against him, the Brookings Institute,

836
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,483
the Plumbers Union, the Enemies List,

837
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:17,049
you're saying all that
goes into Watergate?

838
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:19,387
Correct.

839
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,988
That is absurd and a clear breach

840
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,057
of the terms of our agreement.

841
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:27,194
Okay. How would you define Watergate?

842
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,499
Well, that it covers just that.

843
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,335
The Watergate break-in of June 17th

844
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,705
and the subsequent
cover-up and investigation.

845
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,471
Fine. In which case, the deal is off.

846
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:38,072
Fine. In which case,
you can expect a lawsuit

847
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:40,309
for something in excess of $20 million

848
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:42,443
in damages and loss of earnings.

849
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:45,386
The terms of the
contract clearly stipulate

850
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:49,085
that Watergate take up no
more than 25% of the time.

851
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:52,060
Yes, but nowhere does it say
that for the rest of the 75%

852
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,620
he gets to drone on
and sound presidential.

853
00:43:56,266 --> 00:44:00,464
"Drone on"? Jesus Christ.
Where's your respect?

854
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:03,335
You remember who you're
talking about here.

855
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:07,138
You know as well as I do that 60%
of what he did in office was right,

856
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:11,079
and 30% may have been wrong, but
he thought it was right at the time.

857
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,082
Yes, but that still leaves 10%

858
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,550
where he was doing the
wrong thing and knew it.

859
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,381
You goddamn media
people. You are so smug.

860
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:24,652
Well, I can guarantee you
if you screw us on the 60%,

861
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:28,255
I will ruin you if it
takes the rest of my life.

862
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:31,590
Prick.

863
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,817
Look at you. Gorgeous.

864
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:56,487
Good night, sweet princes.

865
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,187
Cheerio. Bye.

866
00:44:58,262 --> 00:45:00,492
See you in the morning.

867
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,126
Why the monkey suit?

868
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,170
David has a film premiere
he needs to attend.

869
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,762
What? The night before we start taping?

870
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,467
What's the movie?

871
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,443
<i>It's The Slipper and the Rose.</i>

872
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,008
The Cinderella movie?

873
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,277
Yeah. David's the executive producer.

874
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,946
You don't think it might be
an idea for our interviewer

875
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,284
to be rested and focused
on the job in hand?

876
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:26,982
Don't worry.

877
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,491
David is a performer
of the highest caliber.

878
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,028
He's been in these pressure
situations many times before.

879
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:35,293
Come the hour, he'll be fine. Okay?

880
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:42,604
What did he say? Did he say "performer"?

881
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,504
Yeah. That's the word he used?

882
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,769
Yeah, he said "performer."

883
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,003
Not "journalist" or "interviewer"?

884
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:50,171
No. He said "performer."

885
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:54,343
Out of curiosity, where are
you at this moment? Psychically?

886
00:45:56,453 --> 00:46:01,186
I am imagining the dust, the darkness,

887
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,785
the agony and the
unimaginable Ioneliness

888
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,990
of the wilderness I am
about to be dispatched to

889
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:10,795
by my Washington political colleagues.

890
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,780
So any opportunity you get, go right
to foreign policy, go right to Mao,

891
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:26,076
go right to Khrushchev.

892
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,310
Just go right!

893
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:29,181
You could do all day
on foreign policy, sir.

894
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,811
I disagree that the Mao
banquet story is stale.

895
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,412
Excuse me, sir. Something
I think you should see.

896
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:33,547
People love that story.

897
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,648
Why don't we save it for the book?

898
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,750
Yeah, right, come on.

899
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,488
<i>David. Mr. Frost.</i>

900
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:42,623
<i>David, some people in
the media have suggested</i>

901
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,462
<i>that you're not the
right man for the job,</i>

902
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:46,264
<i>that you'll be too
soft on the President.</i>

903
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,201
<i>What will you do if he stonewalls you?</i>

904
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:49,967
<i>Well, I shall say so again and again.</i>

905
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,531
<i>But I should say right
now that I'm not expecting</i>

906
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:55,476
<i>his approach to be to stonewall.</i>

907
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:59,209
<i>I'm hoping that it'll be
that of a cascade of candor.</i>

908
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:00,944
<i>REPORTER 1. "A cascade of candor"?</i>

909
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:02,645
<i>From Richard Nixon?</i>

910
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,744
<i>You think that's what you'll get?</i>

911
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:08,087
<i>No, I just thought it was a
phrase that might appeal to you.</i>

912
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,716
<i>So what about the money?</i>

913
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:11,488
That's a strange fellow.

914
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,553
Started life as a comic, you know.

915
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:14,756
Is that so? Mmm-hmm.

916
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,697
Almost married Diahann Carroll.

917
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:17,756
Who?

918
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,564
The singer.

919
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:22,630
Isn't she black?

920
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,405
Yes, sir.

921
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:29,003
Right here in the Frost
file, which we put together

922
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,707
as part of our general preparations.

923
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:35,376
Okay. Let's get back to work.

924
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:37,749
<i>That's fact, this is fiction.</i>

925
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:39,550
<i>So now it's about The
Slipper and the Rose.</i>

926
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:40,988
<i>It's a cracker of a movie.</i>

927
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,923
<i>I hope you'll all
come and see it, and...</i>

928
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,163
I shouldn't have ordered that coffee.

929
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:53,931
Just don't drink any more.

930
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:01,471
Good luck. Thank you.

931
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:05,738
I'll be thinking of you.

932
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:12,145
Dick. Wait.

933
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:30,468
For the record, I'm gonna
be starting with John's idea.

934
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,303
"Why didn't you burn the tapes?"

935
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:33,604
No. Fuck.

936
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:36,407
Please, God, no! You can't.

937
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,142
David, you can't do that.
It would be a disaster.

938
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:42,310
It would get us into Watergate
way ahead of the agreed time.

939
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:45,048
What is the point of
having contractually set

940
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,283
specific times to deal
with certain subjects

941
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,018
if you're just going to
ignore it right off the bat?

942
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,320
'Cause it's war, isn't it? Gloves off.

943
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:51,588
I like it. It's ballsy.

944
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:52,890
Strategically, it'll
give us the upper hand.

945
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:55,022
It's insanely risky.

946
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,531
He could walk right off the set,

947
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,965
and there's nothing
we could do about it.

948
00:48:58,035 --> 00:48:59,832
Worse, he could sue you!

949
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,565
We were sadly unable to do
the taping at Casa Pacifica

950
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:04,937
because of the Coast
Guard radio interference,

951
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:08,034
so we ended up at the rather
more modest Smith house,

952
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,602
<i>which was owned by a local
Republican businessman.</i>

953
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,306
Right here!

954
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:14,611
Mr. Frost, look over here.

955
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:15,913
Over here, sir!

956
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:17,180
Here we go. Back up behind the curb.

957
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,380
A few questions, please.

958
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,547
Right here, Mr. Frost.

959
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,921
David! David! David!

960
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,764
Well, hello there.

961
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,369
Excuse me, fellas.

962
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:52,647
Nixon, there's blood on your hands!

963
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,183
Liar!

964
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,658
Here comes the President!

965
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,067
Mr. President!

966
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,866
Mr. President!

967
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:11,999
How are you feeling, Mr. President?

968
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:16,579
The Smith family requested that
the furniture be put back in place.

969
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,273
They talked to you about that, too?

970
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,111
They're bugging everybody.

971
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,919
You know, I've written
four books about him,

972
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,652
but this is the first time I've
actually seen him in the flesh.

973
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:32,820
He's taller than I imagined, and tanned.

974
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:35,193
The least he could do is look ravaged.

975
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:38,894
You gonna shake his hand?

976
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,163
Am I gonna shake...

977
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:41,534
Are you kidding me?

978
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,266
After everything that
prick's done to this country?

979
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,637
I'm not gonna shake his hand.

980
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,232
Gentlemen.

981
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:50,637
May I present Bob Zelnick,
my executive editor?

982
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,045
How do you do?

983
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,412
Pleasure, Mr. President.

984
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:56,316
And Jim Reston, one of my researchers.

985
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,616
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Reston.

986
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:03,448
Mr. President.

987
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:06,189
Excuse me, sir? Got a
room for you right here.

988
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:13,899
Wow. That was devastating, withering.

989
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,437
I mean, I don't think he's
ever gonna get over that.

990
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:16,733
Yeah, fuck off.

991
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:21,106
I got you guys set up back here.

992
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:25,114
Now this is your green room.

993
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,673
And the President will
be on the large monitor.

994
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,446
Craft services is that way.

995
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,694
Keep it about that temperature, okay?

996
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,752
Mr. President?

997
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:41,855
Yeah.

998
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,297
Before we start, I just want to say

999
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,460
how delighted we all are
by Mrs. Nixon's recovery.

1000
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,436
Well, thank you. It's true.

1001
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,496
She's much better now.

1002
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:55,102
She's just getting round to the
business of replying to all the cards.

1003
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:58,403
And from our point of view, well,

1004
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:01,144
I'd just like to say how pleased we are

1005
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:02,651
that you got this all together.

1006
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:03,777
Thank you.

1007
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:06,982
As I understand it, it's
been quite a struggle.

1008
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:08,115
Well...

1009
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:10,386
How much has it cost?

1010
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,793
You mind me asking? Hey, come on.

1011
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:16,458
Come on, it's just between us.

1012
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:19,434
Very well. Two million.

1013
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:23,098
<i>Two million? Jeez. I didn't
realize we were making Ben-Hur.</i>

1014
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:28,438
But tell me something.

1015
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,810
You raised it all now?

1016
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,947
Not quite. But we're getting there.

1017
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:38,510
Everyone's been kind and deferred fees.

1018
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:41,618
Well, not quite everyone.

1019
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:44,450
David, I'm gonna go
in with you on camera.

1020
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,223
Excuse me.

1021
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,457
I want to put a
handkerchief here, if I may.

1022
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:50,363
Is that out of shot?

1023
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,196
That's fine, Mr. President.

1024
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,533
Contractually, I think that we made

1025
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:57,903
an agreement that after each question

1026
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:00,534
I might dab my upper
lip before answering it.

1027
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,579
Which you won't show, you
know, when you cut it together.

1028
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:07,139
You're probably aware of my
history with perspiration.

1029
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:10,482
If you're referring to your TV
debate with Jack Kennedy in 1960.

1030
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:15,321
They say that moisture on my
upper lip cost me the presidency.

1031
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:19,522
People who heard it on the
radio, well, they thought I'd won.

1032
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:22,087
But television and the close-up,

1033
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,633
they create their own sets of meanings.

1034
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:27,898
So now they insist I
bring a handkerchief

1035
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,098
and that I have my eyebrows trimmed.

1036
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:31,902
Sixty seconds, everyone.

1037
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,068
You trim yours? No.

1038
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:36,908
No, of course not.

1039
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,448
Yeah, you're light-skinned. Yeah.

1040
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:43,350
You got blue eyes. You've got no
troubles with perspiration, I imagine.

1041
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,388
No, not that I'm aware.

1042
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,889
You were obviously
born to be on the tube.

1043
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:52,193
Stand by to roll tape in 30 seconds.

1044
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,354
Settling.

1045
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,669
Those shoes.

1046
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,140
They're Italian, aren't they?

1047
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,070
My shoes? I believe so.

1048
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:09,802
Yeah, that's interesting.

1049
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:16,247
You don't find them too effeminate?

1050
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:20,422
No.

1051
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,321
Well, I guess somebody in your field

1052
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,223
can get away with them, you know.

1053
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:25,886
Manolo, just check my collar, will you?

1054
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:27,623
David, starting with camera two,

1055
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:34,102
in four, three, two. Cue David. And...

1056
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:40,935
Mr. President. Now, we're going
to be covering a lot of subjects

1057
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:44,412
in a great deal of detail over
the course of these interviews,

1058
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:48,383
but I'd like to begin
completely out of context

1059
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,078
by asking you one question,

1060
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:53,088
more than any other,
almost every American

1061
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:56,319
and people all over the
world want me to ask.

1062
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:00,293
Why didn't you burn the tapes?

1063
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,331
Son of a bitch!

1064
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:14,099
Well, Mr. Frost, I'm
surprised by your question

1065
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:19,280
since we have an agreement, a
contractual agreement, I believe,

1066
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:23,581
that we would cover Watergate
in our last taping session.

1067
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:37,390
But if your viewers really
do have a major concern,

1068
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:42,495
then perhaps I should
briefly respond to it now.

1069
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:45,700
What probably very few people realize

1070
00:55:45,775 --> 00:55:48,005
is that the taping
system in the White House

1071
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:51,343
was set up by my predecessor,
President Johnson,

1072
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:55,544
partly to avoid the necessity of
having a secretary in every meeting,

1073
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:58,143
and partly to ensure there was

1074
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:00,712
a record kept of every verbal agreement,

1075
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,759
no matter how off the cuff or casual.

1076
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:07,021
Now, initially, on coming
into the White House,

1077
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:09,930
I insisted on dismantling the system.
