1
00:01:25,224 --> 00:01:26,782
I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

2
00:01:26,892 --> 00:01:28,883
This is crazy. What did I do?

3
00:01:28,994 --> 00:01:30,427
I feel like you're going to pull over
and snuff me.

4
00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:32,929
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest!

5
00:01:33,032 --> 00:01:34,226
We can talk, sir.

6
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:38,099
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
- No, you intimidate them.

7
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:41,367
Good God, you're a woman.
I honestly... I couldn't have called that.

8
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:43,908
I mean, I'd apologize,
but isn't that what we're going for here?

9
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,773
- I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.

10
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,608
You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

11
00:01:48,714 --> 00:01:51,478
I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.

12
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:54,348
Is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh.

13
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:57,255
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.

14
00:01:57,356 --> 00:02:01,019
Is it true you went 12 for 12
with last year's <i>Maxim</i> cover models?

15
00:02:01,126 --> 00:02:03,253
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

16
00:02:03,362 --> 00:02:04,795
March and I had a scheduling conflict,

17
00:02:04,897 --> 00:02:07,798
but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.

18
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,767
Anything else? You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?

19
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,704
- Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
- Yes. It's very cool.

20
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:19,641
All right.

21
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:21,838
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

22
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:23,505
Please, no gang signs.

23
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,174
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

24
00:02:25,284 --> 00:02:28,253
Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

25
00:02:28,454 --> 00:02:32,390
Come on. Hurry up.
Just click it. Don't change any settings.

26
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,055
- What's going on?
- Contact left!

27
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:41,826
What have we got?

28
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:45,160
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

29
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:46,295
- Stay down!
- Yeah.

30
00:02:52,678 --> 00:02:54,168
Son of a bitch!

31
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:58,646
- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
- Stay here!

32
00:03:27,913 --> 00:03:29,244
Whoa!

33
00:04:18,764 --> 00:04:19,992
<i>Tony Stark.</i>

34
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,933
<i>Visionary. Genius.</i>

35
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:26,668

<i>the son of legendary</i>
<i>weapons developer Howard Stark</i>

38
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:34,069
<i>quickly stole the spotlight</i>
<i>with his brilliant and unique mind.</i>

39
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:37,615
<i>At age four,</i>
<i>he built his first circuit board.</i>

40
00:04:37,716 --> 00:04:39,843
<i>At age six, his first engine.</i>

41
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:44,354
<i>And at 17, he graduated</i>
<i>summa cum laude from MIT.</i>

42
00:04:45,357 --> 00:04:47,723
<i>Then, the passing of a titan.</i>

43
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:52,228
<i>Howard Stark's lifelong friend</i>

<i>steps in to help fill the gap</i>
<i>left by the legendary founder,</i>

45
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:59,267

<i>creating smarter weapons,</i>

50
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:15,117
<i>Today, Tony Stark has changed</i>

58
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:55,121
<i>Tony?</i>

59
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,999
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thanks for the save.

60
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:13,772
<i>This is beautiful. Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you all very much.</i>

61
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,312
<i>This is wonderful.</i>

62
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:19,184
<i>Well, I'm not Tony Stark.</i>

63
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:26,183
<i>But if I were Tony,</i>
<i>I would tell you how honored I feel</i>

64
00:06:26,558 --> 00:06:31,257
<i>and what a joy it is</i>
<i>to receive this very prestigious award.</i>

65
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,129
<i>Tony, you know...</i>

66
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:37,134
<i>The best thing about Tony</i>
<i>is also the worst thing.</i>

67
00:06:37,236 --> 00:06:38,601
<i>He's always working.</i>

68
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:44,106
Work it! Come on!

69
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:51,205
- We should just stay till the morning.
- You are unbelievable.

70
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:54,581
- Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
- Nobody roped me into anything!

71
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:55,653
- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that

72
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:58,621
if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.

73
00:06:58,724 --> 00:07:00,589
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.

74
00:07:00,692 --> 00:07:02,387
- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.

75
00:07:02,494 --> 00:07:04,624
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

76
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,061
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

77
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:08,463
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

78
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:10,125
I don't have any of those
floating around.

79
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:12,294
We're gonna let it ride!

80
00:07:13,438 --> 00:07:15,531
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

81
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:16,733
Okay, you, too.

82
00:07:16,842 --> 00:07:18,707
- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

83
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:21,302
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

84
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:22,641
Two craps. Line away.

85
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:24,545
- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

86
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,049
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, William.

87
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:27,607
- This is where I exit.
- All right.

88
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:28,686
Tomorrow, don't be late.

89
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:30,015
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

90
00:07:30,122 --> 00:07:31,384
I know, I know.

91
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,982
Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.

92
00:07:39,398 --> 00:07:41,662
Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!

93
00:07:42,034 --> 00:07:44,264
Christine Everhart,
<i>Vanity Fair</i> magazine.

94
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:45,427
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

95
00:07:45,537 --> 00:07:47,004
- She's cute.
- She's all right?

96
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:48,139
- Hi.
- Hi.

97
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,174
- Yeah. Okay, go.
- It's okay?

98
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:52,072
You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

99
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:55,010
- What do you say to that?
- Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

100
00:07:55,113 --> 00:07:56,671
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

101
00:07:56,782 --> 00:07:57,942
"The Merchant of Death"?

102
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,540
That's not bad.

103
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:03,450
- Let me guess. Berkeley?
- Brown, actually.

104
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:06,088
Well, Ms. Brown,

105
00:08:06,692 --> 00:08:08,626
it's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

106
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:11,423
I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

107
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,691
I'll start making bricks and beams
for baby hospitals.

108
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:14,823
Rehearse that much?

109
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:16,594
Every night in front of the mirror
before bedtime.

110
00:08:16,702 --> 00:08:19,034
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you first-hand.

111
00:08:19,137 --> 00:08:21,367
All I want is a serious answer.

112
00:08:21,473 --> 00:08:23,668
Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

113
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:26,175
"Peace means having a bigger stick
than the other guy."

114
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:28,542
That's a great line
coming from the guy selling the sticks.

115
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:31,411
My father helped defeat the Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

116
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:34,076
A lot of people,
including your professors at Brown,

117
00:08:34,186 --> 00:08:35,346
would call that being a hero.

118
00:08:35,454 --> 00:08:37,615
And a lot of people
would also call that war profiteering.

119
00:08:37,723 --> 00:08:39,850
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

120
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,687
by advancing medical technology

121
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:44,125
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

122
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:47,460
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

123
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:50,966
You ever lose an hour of sleep
your whole life?

124
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:52,934
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

125
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:08,812
<i>Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.</i>

126
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:12,550
<i>The weather in Malibu</i>
<i>is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.</i>

127
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:16,056
<i>The surf conditions are fair</i>
<i>with waist-to-shoulder high lines.</i>

128
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:18,595
<i>High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.</i>

129
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:36,909
Tony?

130
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,681
Hey, Tony?

131
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:03,737
<i>You are not authorized</i>
<i>to access this area.</i>

132
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:06,571
- Jesus.
- That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

133
00:10:07,112 --> 00:10:09,706
I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

134
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:11,544
and there's a car waiting for you outside

135
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,914
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

136
00:10:14,286 --> 00:10:17,744
- You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
- Indeed I am.

137
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:23,260
After all these years, Tony still has you
picking up the dry-cleaning.

138
00:10:23,362 --> 00:10:26,695
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

139
00:10:26,798 --> 00:10:29,562
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

140
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:30,726
Will that be all?

141
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:49,277
Give me an exploded view.

142
00:10:49,388 --> 00:10:52,619
<i>The compression in cylinder three</i>
<i>appears to be low.</i>

143
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:54,253
Log that.

144
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,089
- I'm gonna try again, right now.
- Please don't turn down my music.

145
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:01,187
I'll keep you posted.

146
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:03,028
You are supposed to be
halfway around the world right now.

147
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:05,467
- How'd she take it?
- Like a champ.

148
00:11:05,737 --> 00:11:07,102
Why are you trying to hustle me
out of here?

149
00:11:07,205 --> 00:11:08,900
Your flight was scheduled to leave
an hour and a half ago.

150
00:11:09,007 --> 00:11:11,100
That's funny, I thought with it being
my plane and all,

151
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:12,733
that it would just wait for me
to get there.

152
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:14,573
Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things

153
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,737
before I get you out of the door.

154
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:18,077
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

155
00:11:18,183 --> 00:11:19,377
if it departs before you arrive?

156
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:22,817
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

157
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:24,513
Do you want it? Yes or no.

158
00:11:24,623 --> 00:11:26,682
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

159
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:29,994
No. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood in East Hampton

160
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:31,323
where he lived and worked,

161
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,920
- not "spring" like the season.
- So?

162
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:37,365
I think it's a fair example.
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

163
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,830
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

164
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:44,166
Okay.
The MIT commencement speech...

165
00:11:44,276 --> 00:11:47,074
Is in June. Please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down...

166
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:49,579
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

167
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:51,148
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

168
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:52,580
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

169
00:11:52,684 --> 00:11:54,584
What are you trying to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?

170
00:11:54,686 --> 00:11:57,177
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.

171
00:11:57,289 --> 00:11:59,314
I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

172
00:11:59,424 --> 00:12:00,914
- It's your birthday?
- Yes.

173
00:12:01,026 --> 00:12:02,459
I knew that. Already?

174
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:06,088
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

175
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:09,592
- Get yourself something nice from me.
- I already did.

176
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:12,135
- And?
- It was very nice.

177
00:12:12,237 --> 00:12:15,638
- Yeah.
- Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.

178
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:18,433
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

179
00:12:21,646 --> 00:12:22,613
Okay.

180
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:44,593
You're good.
I thought I lost you back there.

181
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,172
You did, sir.
I had to cut across Mulholland.

182
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,803
I got you. I got you.

183
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:52,341
What's wrong with you?

184
00:12:52,444 --> 00:12:53,934
- What?
- Three hours.

185
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:56,172
I got caught doing a piece
for <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

186
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:58,249
For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

187
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,841
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.

188
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,488
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

189
00:13:11,563 --> 00:13:14,123
- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.

190
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:16,427
Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

191
00:13:16,535 --> 00:13:19,231
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

192
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:20,770
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.

193
00:13:20,872 --> 00:13:21,998
You don't need to apologize to me.
I'm your man.

194
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:23,096
Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...

195
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,573
- I'm just indifferent right now.
- Hot towel?

196
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:25,870
You don't respect yourself,

197
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:27,308
- so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.

198
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:28,743
I'm just your babysitter.

199
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:31,338
So, when you need
your diaper changed... Thank you.

200
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:33,610
Let me know
and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

201
00:13:33,718 --> 00:13:35,345
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?

202
00:13:35,453 --> 00:13:36,818
- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...

203
00:13:36,922 --> 00:13:38,651
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

204
00:13:38,757 --> 00:13:41,157
- You can't have sashimi without sake.
- You are constitutionally

205
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:42,851
incapable of being responsible.

206
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:45,452
It would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

207
00:13:45,564 --> 00:13:46,588
Hot sake?

208
00:13:46,698 --> 00:13:49,997
- Yes, two, please.
- No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

209
00:13:50,101 --> 00:13:51,432
That's what I'm talking about.

210
00:13:51,536 --> 00:13:54,562
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

211
00:13:54,673 --> 00:13:56,402
you know what I recognize?

212
00:13:56,508 --> 00:14:01,411
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

213
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:04,508
Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

214
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:07,676
No, no. You don't have to be like me!
But you're more than what you are.

215
00:14:07,786 --> 00:14:09,617
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

216
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:12,747
No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

217
00:14:29,474 --> 00:14:30,441
General.

218
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:34,103
Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

219
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:35,179
Thanks.

220
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:39,982
Is it better to be feared or respected?

221
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:43,211
I say, is it too much to ask for both?

222
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:47,090
With that in mind,
I humbly present the crown jewel

223
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:48,955
of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.

224
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,084
It's the first missile system

225
00:14:50,195 --> 00:14:53,028
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

226
00:14:53,131 --> 00:14:57,067
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

227
00:14:57,168 --> 00:14:59,136
I respectfully disagree.

228
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:03,230
I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

229
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,704
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

230
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:09,605
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

231
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:11,045
Find an excuse

232
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:14,448
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

233
00:15:14,552 --> 00:15:18,044
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

234
00:15:36,574 --> 00:15:40,305
For your consideration, the Jericho.

235
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:52,923
I'll be throwing one of these in

236
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:55,015
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

237
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:56,115
To peace!

238
00:15:57,896 --> 00:15:59,921
- <i>Tony.</i>
- Obie, what are you doing up?

239
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:02,499
<i>I couldn't sleep till I found out</i>
<i>how it went. How'd it go?</i>

240
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,397
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be
an early Christmas.

241
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:08,370
<i>Hey! Way to go, my boy!</i>
<i>I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?</i>

242
00:16:08,473 --> 00:16:09,906
Why aren't you wearing those pajamas
I got you?

243
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:11,566
<i>Good night, Tony.</i>

244
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:15,445
- Hey, Tony.
- I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."

245
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:17,481
The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.

246
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:20,278
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.

247
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:29,412
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

248
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:07,786
What the hell did you do to me?

249
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,150
What I did?

250
00:18:11,463 --> 00:18:13,226
What I did is to save your life.

251
00:18:13,498 --> 00:18:17,127
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,

252
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:18,998
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

253
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:21,500
Here, want to see?

254
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,004
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

255
00:18:27,712 --> 00:18:29,907
I've seen many wounds like that
in my village.

256
00:18:30,014 --> 00:18:32,414
We call them the walking dead

257
00:18:32,517 --> 00:18:35,680
because it takes about a week
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

258
00:18:35,787 --> 00:18:38,551
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,

259
00:18:39,357 --> 00:18:41,450
hooked up to a car battery,

260
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:44,460
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

261
00:18:52,737 --> 00:18:54,796
That's right. Smile.

262
00:18:56,541 --> 00:19:00,637
We met once, you know,
at a technical conference in Bern.

263
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:03,703
- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

264
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:07,141
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

265
00:19:07,252 --> 00:19:10,415
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

266
00:19:10,522 --> 00:19:11,819
Where are we?

267
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,656
Come on, stand up. Stand up!

268
00:19:16,661 --> 00:19:18,652
Just do as I do.

269
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:21,423
Come on, put your hands up.

270
00:19:23,201 --> 00:19:24,634
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

271
00:19:24,736 --> 00:19:27,102
Do you understand me? Do as I do.

272
00:19:47,592 --> 00:19:51,790
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer

273
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:53,693
"in the history of America."

274
00:19:57,168 --> 00:19:58,658
He is honored.

275
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:02,935
He wants you to build the missile.

276
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,673
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

277
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:11,407
This one.

278
00:20:16,521 --> 00:20:17,488
I refuse.

279
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:29,233
<i>Tony!</i>

280
00:21:19,283 --> 00:21:21,581
He wants to know what you think.

281
00:21:22,587 --> 00:21:24,350
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

282
00:21:33,364 --> 00:21:37,460
He says they have everything you need
to build the Jericho missile.

283
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:40,195
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

284
00:21:43,474 --> 00:21:46,068
He says for you
to start working immediately,

285
00:21:46,177 --> 00:21:49,408
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

286
00:21:52,917 --> 00:21:55,442
- No, he won't.
- No, he won't.

287
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:11,627
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

288
00:22:11,736 --> 00:22:14,796
But they will never find you
in these mountains.

289
00:22:16,474 --> 00:22:20,171
Look, what you just saw,

290
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:23,071
that is your legacy, Stark.

291
00:22:24,716 --> 00:22:28,083
Your life's work,
in the hands of those murderers.

292
00:22:28,186 --> 00:22:30,450
Is that how you want to go out?

293
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:35,959
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

294
00:22:36,694 --> 00:22:38,252
Or are you going to
do something about it?

295
00:22:38,362 --> 00:22:43,459
Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

296
00:22:43,568 --> 00:22:46,799
And if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.

297
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:48,235
Well, then,

298
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:51,933
this is a very important week for you,
isn't it?

299
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:58,237
If this is going to be my work station,
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

300
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:01,541
I need welding gear.
I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

301
00:23:01,652 --> 00:23:03,813
I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

302
00:23:03,921 --> 00:23:06,913
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets of precision tools.

303
00:23:20,338 --> 00:23:22,738
- How many languages do you speak?
- A lot.

304
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,536
But apparently,
not enough for this place.

305
00:23:25,643 --> 00:23:27,668
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

306
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:31,146
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

307
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,616
- Who are these people?
- They are your loyal customers, sir.

308
00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:39,312
They call themselves the Ten Rings.

309
00:23:48,766 --> 00:23:50,199
You know, we might be more productive

310
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:53,065
if you include me
in the planning process.

311
00:24:01,646 --> 00:24:03,876
Okay, we don't need this.

312
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,283
What is that?

313
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,118
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.

314
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:15,190
We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

315
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:34,711
Careful.
Careful, we only get one shot at this.

316
00:24:34,812 --> 00:24:37,474
Relax. I have steady hands.

317
00:24:38,482 --> 00:24:40,973
Why do you think you're still alive?

318
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:50,624
- What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.

319
00:24:51,162 --> 00:24:53,528
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

320
00:24:54,432 --> 00:24:56,263
Nice to meet you, too.

321
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,604
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

322
00:25:38,976 --> 00:25:42,139
That's because
it's a miniaturized arc reactor.

323
00:25:42,513 --> 00:25:45,277
I got a big one
powering my factory at home.

324
00:25:45,616 --> 00:25:48,346
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

325
00:25:48,452 --> 00:25:50,113
But what could it generate?

326
00:25:50,221 --> 00:25:54,749
If my math is right, and it always is,
three gigajoules per second.

327
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:57,727
That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

328
00:25:57,828 --> 00:26:00,854
Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.

329
00:26:09,874 --> 00:26:13,207
- This is our ticket out of here.
- What is it?

330
00:26:14,745 --> 00:26:16,269
Flatten them out and look.

331
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:19,850
Oh, wow.

332
00:26:22,954 --> 00:26:24,512
Impressive.

333
00:26:50,614 --> 00:26:52,514
Good.

334
00:26:52,616 --> 00:26:55,244
Good roll. Good roll.

335
00:26:56,087 --> 00:26:57,918
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

336
00:26:58,022 --> 00:27:00,820
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.

337
00:27:01,392 --> 00:27:04,361
- It's actually a nice place.
- Got a family?

338
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:09,063
Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

339
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,458
And you, Stark?

340
00:27:15,606 --> 00:27:17,767
- No.
- No?

341
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,135
So you're a man who has everything

342
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,211
and nothing.

343
00:29:02,646 --> 00:29:03,806
Relax.

344
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:15,118
The bow and arrow

345
00:29:15,226 --> 00:29:18,059
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

346
00:29:20,664 --> 00:29:23,030
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

347
00:29:23,868 --> 00:29:26,837
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.

348
00:29:27,438 --> 00:29:31,135
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

349
00:29:32,343 --> 00:29:35,835
and four times
the size of the Roman Empire.

350
00:29:39,517 --> 00:29:40,814
But today,

351
00:29:41,685 --> 00:29:45,052
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

352
00:29:46,123 --> 00:29:47,954
rules these lands.

353
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:51,658
And soon,

354
00:29:54,665 --> 00:29:56,360
it will be my turn.

355
00:30:48,018 --> 00:30:49,007
What does he want?

356
00:31:04,535 --> 00:31:06,935
What do you want? A delivery date?

357
00:31:14,245 --> 00:31:15,576
I need him.

358
00:31:17,748 --> 00:31:19,238
Good assistant.

359
00:31:24,088 --> 00:31:28,047
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

360
00:32:32,856 --> 00:32:35,222
Okay? Can you move?

361
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:37,556
Okay, say it again.

362
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:40,152
41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,

363
00:32:40,264 --> 00:32:43,700
that's from the door,
fork right, 33 steps, turn right.

364
00:33:11,562 --> 00:33:14,429
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

365
00:33:14,932 --> 00:33:16,559
Say something.
Say something back to him.

366
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:18,999
- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
- Then speak Hungarian.

367
00:33:19,103 --> 00:33:21,571
- Okay. I know.
- What do you know?

368
00:33:44,895 --> 00:33:46,988
- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.

369
00:33:47,431 --> 00:33:49,023
- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.

370
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:51,727
- Let me finish this.
- Initialize the power sequence.

371
00:33:52,136 --> 00:33:53,103
Okay.

372
00:33:54,204 --> 00:33:55,398
- Now!
- Tell me. Tell me.

373
00:33:55,506 --> 00:33:59,067
Function 11.
Tell me when you see a progress bar.

374
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,738
- It should be up right now.
- Yes.

375
00:34:00,844 --> 00:34:01,936
Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.

376
00:34:02,045 --> 00:34:03,569
- I have it.
- Press Control "l".

377
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,080
- "I." Got it.
- "I." "Enter." "l" and "Enter."

378
00:34:06,183 --> 00:34:07,878
Come over here and button me up.

379
00:34:10,954 --> 00:34:12,114
Okay. All right.

380
00:34:12,222 --> 00:34:13,519
Every other hex bolt.

381
00:34:13,624 --> 00:34:15,717
- They're coming!
- Nothing pretty, just get it done.

382
00:34:15,826 --> 00:34:17,191
- Just get it done.
- They're coming.

383
00:34:19,663 --> 00:34:21,927
Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?

384
00:34:22,032 --> 00:34:23,727
We need more time.

385
00:34:24,968 --> 00:34:25,935
Hey,

386
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:30,035
- I'm gonna go buy you some time.
- Stick to the plan!

387
00:34:30,774 --> 00:34:32,139
Stick to the plan!

388
00:34:34,111 --> 00:34:35,305
Yinsen!

389
00:37:28,018 --> 00:37:30,452
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!

390
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:46,695
Stark.

391
00:37:48,038 --> 00:37:50,097
Come on. We got to go.

392
00:37:50,874 --> 00:37:53,741
Move for me, come on. We got a plan.
We're gonna stick to it.

393
00:37:53,844 --> 00:37:55,744
This was always the plan, Stark.

394
00:37:56,246 --> 00:37:58,339
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

395
00:37:59,883 --> 00:38:01,783
My family is dead.

396
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:04,849
I'm going to see them now, Stark.

397
00:38:07,357 --> 00:38:08,756
It's okay.

398
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:13,830
I want this. I want this.

399
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,770
Thank you for saving me.

400
00:38:23,273 --> 00:38:27,232
Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.

401
00:39:06,316 --> 00:39:07,283
My turn.

402
00:40:50,887 --> 00:40:51,876
Not bad.

403
00:41:23,887 --> 00:41:25,184
Hey!

404
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:49,676
How was the "fun-vee"?

405
00:41:52,015 --> 00:41:54,381
Next time, you ride with me, okay?

406
00:42:25,482 --> 00:42:27,211
Watch it, coming up here.

407
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:32,313
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

408
00:42:40,597 --> 00:42:43,964
Your eyes are red.
A few tears for your long-lost boss?

409
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:48,629
- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
- Yeah, vacation's over.

410
00:42:50,407 --> 00:42:51,499
Where to, sir?

411
00:42:51,608 --> 00:42:53,200
- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
- No.

412
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,368
No? Tony, you have to

413
00:42:54,477 --> 00:42:55,466
- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.

414
00:42:55,578 --> 00:42:57,307
- The doctor has to look at you.
- I don't have to do anything.

415
00:42:57,414 --> 00:42:59,041
I've been in captivity for three months.

416
00:42:59,149 --> 00:43:02,880
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

417
00:43:02,986 --> 00:43:03,953
- and the other...
- That's enough of that.

418
00:43:04,054 --> 00:43:06,454
...is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

419
00:43:06,556 --> 00:43:07,750
- Call for a press conference?
- Yeah.

420
00:43:07,857 --> 00:43:10,382
- What on earth for?
- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

421
00:43:22,906 --> 00:43:24,601
Look at this!

422
00:43:26,509 --> 00:43:27,669
Tony.

423
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,878
- We were going to meet at the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.

424
00:43:32,983 --> 00:43:34,348
Look at you!

425
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:37,517
- You had to have a burger, yeah?
- Well, come on.

426
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:40,054
- You get me one of those?
- There's only one left. I need it.

427
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:45,823
Hey, look who's here! Yeah!

428
00:43:51,234 --> 00:43:52,701
- Miss Potts?
- Yes.

429
00:43:52,802 --> 00:43:54,030
Can I speak to you for a moment?

430
00:43:54,137 --> 00:43:57,732
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.

431
00:43:57,841 --> 00:43:59,138
I'm not a reporter.

432
00:43:59,242 --> 00:44:00,641
I'm agent Phil Coulson,

433
00:44:00,744 --> 00:44:02,473
with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

434
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:04,171
and Logistics Division.

435
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,976
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.

436
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:11,520
You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

437
00:44:11,621 --> 00:44:15,250
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

438
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:19,021
We need to debrief Mr. Stark
about the circumstances of his escape.

439
00:44:19,129 --> 00:44:22,360
- I'll put something in the book, shall I?
- Thank you.

440
00:44:27,237 --> 00:44:29,762
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

441
00:44:29,873 --> 00:44:33,274
Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...

442
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,535
A little less formal and...

443
00:44:40,417 --> 00:44:43,113
- What's up with the love-in?
- Don't look at me.

444
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:45,244
I don't know what he's up to.

445
00:44:45,355 --> 00:44:47,755
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

446
00:44:47,857 --> 00:44:50,257
I never got to say goodbye to Dad.

447
00:44:50,527 --> 00:44:53,223
I never got to say goodbye to my father.

448
00:44:57,067 --> 00:44:58,329
There's questions
that I would have asked him.

449
00:44:58,435 --> 00:45:01,461
I would have asked him how he felt
about what this company did.

450
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:05,839
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

451
00:45:06,776 --> 00:45:11,042
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

452
00:45:15,418 --> 00:45:17,511
I saw young Americans killed

453
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:22,414
by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

454
00:45:23,893 --> 00:45:25,224
And I saw

455
00:45:26,463 --> 00:45:31,264
that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

456
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:33,301
- Mr. Stark!
- Hey, Ben.

457
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:36,038
What happened over there?

458
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:40,569
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that I have more

459
00:45:40,677 --> 00:45:45,046
to offer this world
than just making things that blow up.

460
00:45:45,148 --> 00:45:48,606
<i>And that is why, effective immediately,</i>
<i>I am shutting down</i>

461
00:45:48,718 --> 00:45:52,347
<i>the weapons manufacturing division</i>
<i>of Stark International</i>

462
00:45:52,455 --> 00:45:56,448
<i>until such a time as I can decide</i>
<i>what the future of the company will be.</i>

463
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:58,083
<i>I think we're gonna be selling</i>
<i>a lot of newspapers.</i>

464
00:45:58,194 --> 00:45:59,923
<i>What direction it should take,</i>
<i>one that I'm comfortable with</i>

465
00:46:00,029 --> 00:46:04,056
<i>and is consistent with the highest good</i>
<i>for this country, as well.</i>

466
00:46:05,435 --> 00:46:10,202
<i>What we should take away from this</i>
<i>is that Tony's back!</i>

467
00:46:10,673 --> 00:46:12,971
<i>And he's healthier than ever.</i>

468
00:46:13,376 --> 00:46:16,470
<i>We're going to have</i>
<i>a little internal discussion</i>

469
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:18,945
<i>and we'll get back to you</i>
<i>with the follow-up.</i>

470
00:46:21,184 --> 00:46:23,414
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

471
00:46:34,364 --> 00:46:37,162
Well, that... That went well.

472
00:46:37,267 --> 00:46:39,667
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

473
00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:42,067
Your head? What about my head?

474
00:46:42,172 --> 00:46:45,164
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

475
00:46:45,341 --> 00:46:48,333
- Optimistically, 40 points.
- At minimum.

476
00:46:48,778 --> 00:46:49,745
Yep.

477
00:46:50,113 --> 00:46:53,344
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

478
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:56,077
Obie, I just don't want a body count
to be our only legacy.

479
00:46:56,186 --> 00:46:58,780
That's what we do. We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

480
00:46:58,888 --> 00:47:00,014
It's my name on the side of the building.

481
00:47:00,123 --> 00:47:02,717
And what we do
keeps the world from falling into chaos.

482
00:47:02,825 --> 00:47:04,759
Not based on what I saw.

483
00:47:06,029 --> 00:47:06,996
We're not doing a good enough job.

484
00:47:07,096 --> 00:47:08,324
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

485
00:47:08,431 --> 00:47:11,298
Like what?
You want us to make baby bottles?

486
00:47:12,335 --> 00:47:15,566
I think we should take another look
into arc reactor technology.

487
00:47:15,672 --> 00:47:19,972
Come on.
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

488
00:47:20,343 --> 00:47:23,437
Tony, come on. We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

489
00:47:23,546 --> 00:47:26,640
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

490
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:30,381
The arc was never cost effective.
We knew that before we built it.

491
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,648
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

492
00:47:33,756 --> 00:47:34,882
Maybe.

493
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:37,918
Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

494
00:47:38,027 --> 00:47:40,518
- Thirty years.
- That's what they say.

495
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:45,394
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

496
00:47:45,501 --> 00:47:48,698
- Never mind who told me. Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.

497
00:47:48,805 --> 00:47:51,103
- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

498
00:47:59,549 --> 00:48:01,016
- Okay.
- Okay?

499
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,548
It works.

500
00:48:09,626 --> 00:48:13,790
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team.
Do you understand?

501
00:48:13,896 --> 00:48:17,127
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

502
00:48:17,233 --> 00:48:18,632
like your father and I.

503
00:48:18,735 --> 00:48:20,498
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

504
00:48:20,603 --> 00:48:22,161
- But if I had...
- Tony.

505
00:48:22,272 --> 00:48:25,264
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

506
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:28,071
- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

507
00:48:28,711 --> 00:48:30,838
You gotta let me handle this.

508
00:48:30,947 --> 00:48:33,347
We're gonna have to play
a whole different kind of ball now.

509
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:35,246
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

510
00:48:35,351 --> 00:48:38,582
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

511
00:48:38,888 --> 00:48:40,617
<i>Stark Industries!</i>

512
00:48:40,723 --> 00:48:43,556
<i>I've got one recommendation!</i>
<i>Ready? Ready?</i>

513
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,786
<i>Sell, sell, sell!</i>

514
00:48:45,028 --> 00:48:46,996
<i>Abandon ship!</i>

515
00:48:47,096 --> 00:48:50,429
<i>Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?</i>

516
00:48:51,834 --> 00:48:56,737
<i>Let me show you the new</i>
<i>Stark Industries business plan!</i>

517
00:48:58,408 --> 00:49:02,310
<i>Look, that's a weapons company</i>
<i>that doesn't make weapons!</i>

518
00:49:02,879 --> 00:49:05,670
<i>Pepper. How big are your hands?</i>

519
00:49:06,215 --> 00:49:08,410
- What?
- <i>How big are your hands?</i>

520
00:49:08,518 --> 00:49:11,385
- I don't understand why...
- <i>Get down here. I need you.</i>

521
00:49:18,795 --> 00:49:19,819
Hey.

522
00:49:21,898 --> 00:49:24,389
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

523
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,467
Let's see them.

524
00:49:25,868 --> 00:49:27,893
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

525
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:31,362
I just need your help for a sec.

526
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:34,369
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

527
00:49:34,477 --> 00:49:37,002
It was. It is now an antique.

528
00:49:37,847 --> 00:49:40,611
This is what will be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

529
00:49:40,717 --> 00:49:45,313
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

530
00:49:45,588 --> 00:49:48,352
- Speed bump, what does that mean?
- It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

531
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:51,791
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

532
00:49:51,894 --> 00:49:54,988
And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

533
00:49:55,098 --> 00:49:56,725
It's fine.

534
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:59,567
- What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.

535
00:49:59,669 --> 00:50:01,432
- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!

536
00:50:01,537 --> 00:50:05,803
I want you to reach in, and you're just
gonna gently lift the wire out.

537
00:50:06,642 --> 00:50:08,667
- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

538
00:50:08,778 --> 00:50:10,405
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

539
00:50:10,513 --> 00:50:11,844
the socket wall or it goes "beep."

540
00:50:11,948 --> 00:50:14,416
- What do you mean, "Operation"?
- It's just a game, never mind.

541
00:50:14,517 --> 00:50:18,510
- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
- Okay.

542
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,858
You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

543
00:50:22,959 --> 00:50:26,986
No, you're fine.
You're the most capable, qualified,

544
00:50:27,096 --> 00:50:30,588
trustworthy person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

545
00:50:31,901 --> 00:50:33,835
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

546
00:50:33,936 --> 00:50:36,598
- Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

547
00:50:36,706 --> 00:50:37,798
Okay.

548
00:50:42,145 --> 00:50:43,737
Oh, there's pus!

549
00:50:43,846 --> 00:50:48,442
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

550
00:50:48,551 --> 00:50:50,451
- not from my body.
- It smells!

551
00:50:50,553 --> 00:50:52,043
Yeah, it does.

552
00:50:52,455 --> 00:50:55,117
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?

553
00:50:55,224 --> 00:50:56,316
- Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?

554
00:50:56,426 --> 00:50:59,327
Now, don't let it touch the sides
when you're coming out!

555
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:00,396
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

556
00:51:00,496 --> 00:51:01,827
That's what
I was trying to tell you before.

557
00:51:01,931 --> 00:51:04,058
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull it out, you don't...

558
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:07,102
There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it. You just pulled it out.

559
00:51:07,203 --> 00:51:08,329
- Oh, God!
- Okay, I was not expecting...

560
00:51:08,438 --> 00:51:10,565
- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
- Okay, what do I do?

561
00:51:10,673 --> 00:51:11,662
What's wrong?

562
00:51:11,774 --> 00:51:13,105
Nothing,
I'm just going into cardiac arrest

563
00:51:13,209 --> 00:51:14,471
'cause you yanked it out like a trout...

564
00:51:14,577 --> 00:51:17,341
- What? You said it was safe!
- We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

565
00:51:17,447 --> 00:51:19,415
- You gotta switch it out really quick.
- Okay. Okay.

566
00:51:19,749 --> 00:51:21,546
- Tony? It's going to be okay.
- What?

567
00:51:21,651 --> 00:51:22,618
- Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

568
00:51:22,718 --> 00:51:25,346
- I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

569
00:51:25,888 --> 00:51:29,984
Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you...

570
00:51:34,096 --> 00:51:37,588
Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

571
00:51:38,801 --> 00:51:39,825
Nice.

572
00:51:39,936 --> 00:51:42,166
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

573
00:51:42,271 --> 00:51:43,499
You okay?

574
00:51:44,974 --> 00:51:47,841
Don't ever, ever, ever,

575
00:51:47,944 --> 00:51:50,913
ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

576
00:51:51,013 --> 00:51:53,106
I don't have anyone but you.

577
00:51:58,788 --> 00:51:59,755
Anyway...

578
00:52:05,661 --> 00:52:08,562
- What do you want me to do with this?
- That?

579
00:52:09,398 --> 00:52:10,729
Destroy it.

580
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,767
Incinerate it.

581
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:15,061
You don't want to keep it?

582
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:19,301
Pepper, I've been called many things.
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

583
00:52:19,876 --> 00:52:23,573
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That will be all, Miss Potts.

584
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,009
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

585
00:52:26,115 --> 00:52:28,015
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

586
00:52:28,117 --> 00:52:31,280
That's my phone,
that's a picture of me and my dad.

587
00:52:31,387 --> 00:52:34,288
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

588
00:52:40,496 --> 00:52:44,728
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

589
00:52:45,067 --> 00:52:47,160
I'll tell you, in my experience,

590
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:52,003
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

591
00:52:52,408 --> 00:52:53,636
his insight,

592
00:52:53,743 --> 00:52:56,735
that ability to look
into a situation beyond the obvious

593
00:52:56,846 --> 00:53:00,441
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

594
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:03,542
Colonel?
Why not a pilot without the plane?

595
00:53:03,653 --> 00:53:05,621
Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

596
00:53:05,721 --> 00:53:07,621
- Hello, sir.
- Speaking of manned or unmanned,

597
00:53:07,723 --> 00:53:09,554
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong

598
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:12,253
at spring break.
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.

599
00:53:12,361 --> 00:53:13,623
- That lovely lady you woke up with.
- Don't do that!

600
00:53:13,729 --> 00:53:15,094
- What was his name?
- Don't do that.

601
00:53:15,197 --> 00:53:16,255
- Was it Ivan?
- Don't do that.

602
00:53:16,365 --> 00:53:17,593
They'll believe it. Don't do that.

603
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,826
- Okay.
- Don't do that.

604
00:53:18,935 --> 00:53:21,870
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

605
00:53:24,807 --> 00:53:26,468
- I'm surprised.
- Why?

606
00:53:26,576 --> 00:53:29,272
I swear, I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.

607
00:53:29,445 --> 00:53:31,242
I'm doing a little better than walking.

608
00:53:31,347 --> 00:53:32,780
- Really?
- Yeah.

609
00:53:33,516 --> 00:53:36,110
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

610
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,220
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

611
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:42,923
You're about to make a whole
lot of people around here real happy,

612
00:53:43,059 --> 00:53:46,028
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

613
00:53:46,128 --> 00:53:47,686
that was a doozy.

614
00:53:48,097 --> 00:53:52,591
This is not for the military. I'm not...
It's different.

615
00:53:52,702 --> 00:53:55,330
What? You're a humanitarian now
or something?

616
00:53:55,438 --> 00:53:56,837
- I need you to listen to me.
- No.

617
00:53:56,939 --> 00:54:00,807
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

618
00:54:02,712 --> 00:54:04,236
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

619
00:54:07,249 --> 00:54:09,376
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

620
00:54:09,485 --> 00:54:10,645
Thanks.

621
00:54:18,928 --> 00:54:22,295
- Jarvis, you up?
- <i>For you, sir, always.</i>

622
00:54:22,598 --> 00:54:26,466
I'd like to open a new project file,
index as Mark Two.

623
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:31,333
<i>Shall I store this on</i>
<i>the Stark Industries Central Database?</i>

624
00:54:31,674 --> 00:54:34,040
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

625
00:54:34,143 --> 00:54:36,941
Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?

626
00:54:37,046 --> 00:54:39,742
<i>Working on a secret project,</i>
<i>are we, sir?</i>

627
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:46,779
I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

628
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:51,426
Maybe in mine,
it can actually do some good.

629
00:55:34,704 --> 00:55:37,400
Next. Up.

630
00:55:38,074 --> 00:55:40,941
Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here.
You got me?

631
00:55:41,043 --> 00:55:43,102
Stay put. Nice.

632
00:55:44,947 --> 00:55:48,747
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

633
00:55:49,251 --> 00:55:51,378
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

634
00:55:58,294 --> 00:55:59,454
Up.

635
00:56:00,329 --> 00:56:02,126
Screw it. Don't even move.

636
00:56:02,231 --> 00:56:05,257
You are a tragedy.

637
00:56:15,144 --> 00:56:17,704
<i>Okay, let's do this right.</i>

638
00:56:18,414 --> 00:56:21,212
<i>Start mark, half a meter,</i>
<i>and back and center.</i>

639
00:56:24,019 --> 00:56:26,180
<i>Dummy, look alive.</i>
<i>You're on standby for fire safety.</i>

640
00:56:26,288 --> 00:56:27,687
You, roll it.

641
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:33,551
<i>Okay. Activate hand controls.</i>

642
00:56:37,933 --> 00:56:39,059
<i>We're gonna start off nice and easy.</i>

643
00:56:39,168 --> 00:56:42,331
<i>We're gonna see if</i>
<i>10% thrust capacity achieves lift.</i>

644
00:56:42,438 --> 00:56:43,769
<i>And three,</i>

645
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,629
<i>two,</i>

646
00:56:46,475 --> 00:56:47,567
<i>one.</i>

647
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,978
Up two. All right, set that.

648
00:57:27,082 --> 00:57:29,448
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

649
00:57:29,552 --> 00:57:31,383
Yeah, everything's... What?

650
00:57:31,487 --> 00:57:32,613
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great!

651
00:57:32,721 --> 00:57:34,712
- What would you like me to tell him?
- Great. I'll be right up.

652
00:57:35,224 --> 00:57:36,418
Okay.

653
00:57:37,226 --> 00:57:39,023
I thought you said
you were done making weapons.

654
00:57:39,128 --> 00:57:40,095
It is.

655
00:57:40,629 --> 00:57:44,156
This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

656
00:57:48,237 --> 00:57:49,431
I didn't expect that.

657
00:57:54,777 --> 00:57:56,142
How'd it go?

658
00:57:58,447 --> 00:58:00,074
It went that bad, huh?

659
00:58:00,182 --> 00:58:02,810
Just because I brought pizza
back from New York

660
00:58:02,918 --> 00:58:06,786
- doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

661
00:58:06,889 --> 00:58:09,756
It would have gone better
if you were there.

662
00:58:10,025 --> 00:58:11,549
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

663
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:16,154
- I lay low, and you take care of all...
- Hey, come on. In public. The press.

664
00:58:17,266 --> 00:58:21,396
- This was a board of directors meeting.
- This was a board of directors meeting?

665
00:58:22,504 --> 00:58:24,938
The board is claiming
you have posttraumatic stress.

666
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,132
They're filing an injunction.

667
00:58:26,242 --> 00:58:28,267
- A what?
- They want to lock you out.

668
00:58:28,377 --> 00:58:29,571
Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

669
00:58:29,678 --> 00:58:30,645
We knew that was gonna happen.

670
00:58:30,746 --> 00:58:32,805
- Fifty-six and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

671
00:58:32,915 --> 00:58:35,110
We own the controlling interest
in the company.

672
00:58:35,217 --> 00:58:37,947
Tony, the board has rights, too.

673
00:58:38,854 --> 00:58:42,688
They're making the case
that you and your new direction

674
00:58:42,791 --> 00:58:45,021
- isn't in the company's best interest.
- I'm being responsible!

675
00:58:45,127 --> 00:58:48,119
That's a new direction for me,
for the company.

676
00:58:49,064 --> 00:58:52,932
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

677
00:58:53,035 --> 00:58:54,024
This is great.

678
00:58:54,136 --> 00:58:57,594
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.

679
00:58:57,706 --> 00:58:59,867
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

680
00:58:59,975 --> 00:59:03,308
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

681
00:59:03,412 --> 00:59:04,970
Something to pitch them.

682
00:59:05,114 --> 00:59:08,550
Let me have the engineers analyze that.
You know, draw up some specs.

683
00:59:08,651 --> 00:59:10,778
- No. No, absolutely not.
- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

684
00:59:10,886 --> 00:59:12,444
- in New York!
- This one stays with me.

685
00:59:12,554 --> 00:59:15,352
- That's it, Obie. Forget it.
- All right, well, this stays with me, then.

686
00:59:15,457 --> 00:59:17,288
Go on, here, you can have a piece.

687
00:59:17,393 --> 00:59:18,860
- Take two.
- Thank you.

688
00:59:18,961 --> 00:59:20,826
You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

689
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,522
Good night, Obie.

690
00:59:23,198 --> 00:59:27,999
Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,

691
00:59:28,103 --> 00:59:30,765
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

692
00:59:30,873 --> 00:59:33,671
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.

693
00:59:33,776 --> 00:59:35,607
<i>All right, nice and easy.</i>

694
00:59:35,711 --> 00:59:40,614
<i>Seriously, just gonna start off</i>
<i>with 1% thrust capacity.</i>

695
00:59:42,151 --> 00:59:44,210
<i>And three, two, one.</i>

696
00:59:56,065 --> 00:59:57,054
Okay.

697
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,992
Please don't follow me around
with it, either,

698
01:00:00,102 --> 01:00:02,502
'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

699
01:00:02,604 --> 01:00:04,265
Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

700
01:00:04,373 --> 01:00:06,603
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

701
01:00:06,709 --> 01:00:08,301
Three, two, one.

702
01:00:24,927 --> 01:00:27,487
Okay, this is where I don't want to be!

703
01:00:27,596 --> 01:00:28,893
Not the car, not the car!

704
01:00:30,265 --> 01:00:31,232
Table!

705
01:00:42,344 --> 01:00:46,440
Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

706
01:01:04,566 --> 01:01:06,056
No!

707
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:09,797
Yeah, I can fly.

708
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:17,545
- Jarvis, are you there?
- <i>At your service, sir.</i>

709
01:01:17,646 --> 01:01:19,841
- Engage Heads Up Display.
- <i>Check.</i>

710
01:01:19,948 --> 01:01:21,973
Import all preferences
from home interface.

711
01:01:22,084 --> 01:01:23,517
<i>Will do, sir.</i>

712
01:01:30,492 --> 01:01:31,481
All right, what do you say?

713
01:01:31,593 --> 01:01:35,051
<i>I have indeed been uploaded, sir.</i>
<i>We're online and ready.</i>

714
01:01:35,197 --> 01:01:36,789
Can we start the virtual walk-around?

715
01:01:36,899 --> 01:01:39,868
<i>Importing preferences</i>
<i>and calibrating virtual environment.</i>

716
01:01:39,968 --> 01:01:41,265
Do a check on control surfaces.

717
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:42,860
<i>As you wish.</i>

718
01:02:04,793 --> 01:02:07,318
<i>Test complete. Preparing to</i>
<i>power down and begin diagnostics.</i>

719
01:02:07,429 --> 01:02:10,330
Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

720
01:02:10,432 --> 01:02:11,899
Start listening in on ground control.

721
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,058
<i>Sir, there are still terabytes</i>

722
01:02:13,168 --> 01:02:15,762
<i>of calculations needed</i>
<i>before an actual flight is...</i>

723
01:02:15,871 --> 01:02:19,773
Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

724
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:24,141
Ready? In three, two, one.

725
01:02:47,469 --> 01:02:49,232
Handles like a dream.

726
01:03:17,332 --> 01:03:18,924
All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

727
01:03:19,034 --> 01:03:20,433
What's SR-71's record?

728
01:03:20,536 --> 01:03:24,302
<i>The altitude record for fixed wing flight</i>
<i>is 85,000 feet, sir.</i>

729
01:03:24,773 --> 01:03:27,401
Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

730
01:03:30,612 --> 01:03:34,207
<i>Sir, there is a potentially fatal</i>
<i>buildup of ice occurring.</i>

731
01:03:34,316 --> 01:03:35,374
Keep going!

732
01:03:37,686 --> 01:03:38,983
Higher!

733
01:03:52,668 --> 01:03:56,934
We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

734
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:02,040
Come on, we got to break the ice!

735
01:04:37,312 --> 01:04:38,540
Kill power.

736
01:06:02,941 --> 01:06:06,308
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish
at plus 40 altitude.

737
01:06:06,411 --> 01:06:10,814
Hull pressurization is problematic.
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

738
01:06:10,916 --> 01:06:13,111
<i>A very astute observation, sir.</i>

739
01:06:13,218 --> 01:06:14,981
<i>Perhaps, if you intend</i>
<i>to visit other planets,</i>

740
01:06:15,087 --> 01:06:16,520
<i>we should improve the exosystems.</i>

741
01:06:16,621 --> 01:06:19,181
Connect to the sys. co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

742
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:22,351
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

743
01:06:22,461 --> 01:06:26,295
That should ensure a fuselage integrity
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

744
01:06:26,398 --> 01:06:27,660
- Got it?
- <i>Yes.</i>

745
01:06:27,766 --> 01:06:30,064
<i>Shall I render</i>
<i>using proposed specifications?</i>

746
01:06:30,168 --> 01:06:31,499
Thrill me.

747
01:06:32,904 --> 01:06:37,432
<i>Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right</i>
<i>here at the Disney Concert Hall,</i>

748
01:06:37,542 --> 01:06:41,774
<i>where Tony Stark's third annual benefit</i>
<i>for the Firefighter's Family Fund</i>

749
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,438
<i>has become the place to be</i>
<i>for L.A.'s high society.</i>

750
01:06:43,548 --> 01:06:44,776
Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

751
01:06:44,883 --> 01:06:47,374
<i>I have no record of an invitation, sir.</i>

752
01:06:47,486 --> 01:06:48,919
<i>... hasn't been seen in public</i>

753
01:06:49,021 --> 01:06:52,718
<i>since his bizarre and highly</i>
<i>controversial press conference.</i>

754
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:55,586
<i>Some claim he's suffering</i>
<i>from posttraumatic stress</i>

755
01:06:55,694 --> 01:06:59,289
<i>and has been bedridden for weeks.</i>
<i>Whatever the case may be,</i>

756
01:06:59,798 --> 01:07:02,528
<i>no one expects an appearance</i>
<i>from him tonight.</i>

757
01:07:02,634 --> 01:07:04,761
<i>The render is complete.</i>

758
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:06,531
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

759
01:07:06,638 --> 01:07:09,664
<i>What was I thinking?</i>
<i>You're usually so discreet.</i>

760
01:07:11,343 --> 01:07:13,937
Tell you what.
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

761
01:07:14,046 --> 01:07:16,913
<i>Yes, that should help you</i>
<i>keep a low profile.</i>

762
01:07:20,118 --> 01:07:21,983
<i>The render is complete.</i>

763
01:07:22,487 --> 01:07:24,352
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.

764
01:07:24,456 --> 01:07:26,014
<i>Commencing automated assembly.</i>

765
01:07:26,124 --> 01:07:29,287
<i>Estimated completion time is five hours.</i>

766
01:07:29,394 --> 01:07:30,554
Don't wait up for me, honey.

767
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:58,450
Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what Stark Industries

768
01:07:58,557 --> 01:08:02,288
is all about, and our partnership
with the fire and rescue community...

769
01:08:04,963 --> 01:08:07,454
- Hey, Tony, remember me?
- Sure don't.

770
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,467
You look great, Hef.

771
01:08:12,337 --> 01:08:13,634
We're going to have a great quarter.

772
01:08:13,738 --> 01:08:17,469
What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

773
01:08:17,576 --> 01:08:21,740
Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.

774
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:23,576
I'll see you inside.

775
01:08:24,182 --> 01:08:27,447
Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right?

776
01:08:27,552 --> 01:08:29,247
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

777
01:08:29,354 --> 01:08:32,915
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

778
01:08:37,462 --> 01:08:40,989
- Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
- Mr. Stark?

779
01:08:41,733 --> 01:08:43,462
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.

780
01:08:43,969 --> 01:08:46,164
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

781
01:08:46,271 --> 01:08:49,570
Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

782
01:08:49,674 --> 01:08:51,301
God, you need a new name for that.

783
01:08:51,409 --> 01:08:53,343
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

784
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:57,945
Listen, I know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.

785
01:08:58,049 --> 01:09:00,017
There's still
a lot of unanswered questions,

786
01:09:00,118 --> 01:09:01,983
and time can be a factor
with these things.

787
01:09:02,087 --> 01:09:04,078
Let's just put something on the books.

788
01:09:04,189 --> 01:09:07,522
How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m.
at Stark Industries?

789
01:09:07,926 --> 01:09:11,157
Tell you what.
You got it. You're absolutely right.

790
01:09:11,396 --> 01:09:15,594
Well, I'm going to go to my assistant,
and we'll make a date.

791
01:09:17,068 --> 01:09:19,127
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

792
01:09:19,237 --> 01:09:21,501
- What are you doing here?
- Just avoiding government agents.

793
01:09:21,606 --> 01:09:23,369
- Are you by yourself?
- Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

794
01:09:23,475 --> 01:09:25,272
- Oh, it was a birthday present.
- That's great.

795
01:09:25,377 --> 01:09:27,504
- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.

796
01:09:27,612 --> 01:09:28,840
Yes.

797
01:09:28,947 --> 01:09:30,812
- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.

798
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:33,407
- All right, come on.
- Thank you. No.

799
01:09:43,862 --> 01:09:46,057
Am I making you uncomfortable?

800
01:09:46,498 --> 01:09:51,731
No. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

801
01:09:51,836 --> 01:09:55,636
in front of everyone that I work with
in a dress with no back.

802
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:58,466
- You look great and you smell great.
- Oh, God.

803
01:09:58,577 --> 01:10:00,442
But I could fire you if that would
take the edge off.

804
01:10:00,545 --> 01:10:04,174
I actually don't think that
you could tie your shoes without me.

805
01:10:04,282 --> 01:10:05,715
- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?

806
01:10:05,817 --> 01:10:08,285
What's your Social Security number?

807
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:13,519
- Five.
- Five?

808
01:10:14,392 --> 01:10:15,654
- Right.
- Right.

809
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,092
You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

810
01:10:18,196 --> 01:10:21,359
The other eight?
So I got you for the other eight.

811
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:37,005
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

812
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:40,884
- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

813
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:43,784
It was totally not harmless, by the way.

814
01:10:44,022 --> 01:10:45,284
We're dancing. No one's even watching.

815
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:47,153
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

816
01:10:47,259 --> 01:10:50,387
I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.

817
01:10:50,495 --> 01:10:53,862
No, it was not just a dance. You don't
understand because you're you.

818
01:10:53,965 --> 01:10:56,763
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

819
01:10:56,868 --> 01:11:00,065
and how you are with girls
and all of that, which is completely fine.

820
01:11:00,205 --> 01:11:02,537
But, you know, then me, you're my boss,

821
01:11:02,641 --> 01:11:04,609
- and I'm dancing with you.
- I don't think it was taken that way.

822
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:07,542
Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

823
01:11:07,646 --> 01:11:09,546
- I just think you're overstating it.
- You know, and we're here,

824
01:11:09,648 --> 01:11:13,414
and then I'm wearing this ridiculous

825
01:11:13,518 --> 01:11:16,248
dress, and then we were dancing
like that and...

826
01:11:30,235 --> 01:11:33,102
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it, okay.

827
01:11:34,506 --> 01:11:37,407
- I would like a vodka martini, please.
- Okay.

828
01:11:37,509 --> 01:11:42,173
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

829
01:11:43,081 --> 01:11:46,107
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

830
01:11:46,217 --> 01:11:48,344
Make one of them dirty, will you?

831
01:11:53,024 --> 01:11:55,584
Wow. Tony Stark.

832
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:58,258
- Oh, hey.
- Fancy seeing you here.

833
01:12:02,334 --> 01:12:03,330
- Carrie.
- Christine.

834
01:12:03,435 --> 01:12:04,402
That's right.

835
01:12:04,502 --> 01:12:07,164
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

836
01:12:07,272 --> 01:12:08,637
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

837
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:11,174
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.

838
01:12:11,276 --> 01:12:12,607
'Cause I was referring
to your company's

839
01:12:12,711 --> 01:12:14,042
involvement in this latest atrocity.

840
01:12:14,145 --> 01:12:16,670
Yeah. They just put my name on the
invitation. I don't know what to tell you.

841
01:12:16,781 --> 01:12:19,113
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

842
01:12:19,217 --> 01:12:21,583
I was out of town for a couple months,
in case you didn't hear.

843
01:12:21,686 --> 01:12:23,984
Is this what you call accountability?

844
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:26,785
It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

845
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:40,770
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.

846
01:12:41,272 --> 01:12:43,263
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.

847
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:45,309
Well, I'm not my company.

848
01:12:46,444 --> 01:12:49,675
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?

849
01:12:49,781 --> 01:12:51,112
- What's going on in Gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.

850
01:12:51,216 --> 01:12:54,515
- You can't afford to be this naive.
- You know what? I was naive before,

851
01:12:54,619 --> 01:12:56,450
when they said,
"Here's the line. We don't cross it.

852
01:12:56,554 --> 01:12:57,919
"This is how we do business."

853
01:12:58,022 --> 01:13:01,185
If we're double-dealing under the table...
Are we?

854
01:13:01,659 --> 01:13:03,752
Tony, your picture, please!

855
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:09,488
Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time!

856
01:13:11,302 --> 01:13:14,396
Tony. Who do you think locked you out?

857
01:13:15,173 --> 01:13:18,404
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

858
01:13:20,879 --> 01:13:23,575
It was the only way I could protect you.

859
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:27,178
No. No.

860
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:39,526
<i>The 15-mile hike to the outskirts</i>
<i>of Gulmira can only be described</i>

861
01:13:39,631 --> 01:13:43,294
<i>as a descent into hell,</i>
<i>into a modern day</i> Heart of Darkness.

862
01:13:43,501 --> 01:13:46,402
<i>Simple farmers and herders</i>
<i>from peaceful villages</i>

863
01:13:46,504 --> 01:13:48,199
<i>have been driven from their homes,</i>

864
01:13:48,306 --> 01:13:52,538
<i>displaced from their lands by warlords</i>
<i>emboldened by a new-found power.</i>

865
01:13:52,877 --> 01:13:55,869
<i>Villagers have been forced to take</i>
<i>shelter in whatever crude dwellings</i>

866
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:58,744
<i>they can find in the ruins</i>
<i>of other villages,</i>

867
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:02,684
<i>or here in the remnants</i>
<i>of an old Soviet smelting plant.</i>

868
01:14:07,492 --> 01:14:10,859
<i>Recent violence has been attributed</i>
<i>to a group of foreign fighters</i>

869
01:14:10,962 --> 01:14:13,658
<i>referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.</i>

870
01:14:13,932 --> 01:14:17,265
<i>As you can see, these men are</i>
<i>heavily armed and on a mission.</i>

871
01:14:17,368 --> 01:14:21,464
<i>A mission that could prove fatal</i>
<i>to anyone who stands in their way.</i>

872
01:14:21,706 --> 01:14:24,231
<i>With no political will</i>
<i>or international pressure,</i>

873
01:14:24,342 --> 01:14:26,776
<i>there's very little hope</i>
<i>for these refugees.</i>

874
01:14:26,878 --> 01:14:30,143
<i>Around me, a woman begging for news</i>
<i>on her husband,</i>

875
01:14:30,248 --> 01:14:32,011
<i>who was kidnapped by insurgents,</i>

876
01:14:32,116 --> 01:14:34,641
<i>either forced to join their militia...</i>

877
01:14:35,687 --> 01:14:38,281
<i>Desperate refugees clutch</i>
<i>yellowed photographs,</i>

878
01:14:38,389 --> 01:14:40,949
<i>holding them up to anyone</i>
<i>who will stop.</i>

879
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:44,654
<i>A child's simple question,</i>
<i>"Where are my mother and father?"</i>

880
01:14:46,297 --> 01:14:48,697
<i>There's very little hope</i>
<i>for these refugees,</i>

881
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,634
<i>refugees who can only wonder who,</i>
<i>if anyone, will help.</i>

882
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:26,611
<i>He's all yours.</i>

883
01:19:25,443 --> 01:19:27,274
What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

884
01:19:27,378 --> 01:19:29,608
No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

885
01:19:29,714 --> 01:19:31,147
Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

886
01:19:31,249 --> 01:19:33,149
Get those monitors up!

887
01:19:33,251 --> 01:19:34,548
We got a bogey!

888
01:19:34,652 --> 01:19:36,779
- Wasn't Air Force!
- We got the CIA on the line?

889
01:19:36,888 --> 01:19:38,822
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

890
01:19:38,923 --> 01:19:40,550
No, it definitely is not us, sir!

891
01:19:40,658 --> 01:19:42,319
- It wasn't Navy.
- Wasn't Marines.

892
01:19:42,426 --> 01:19:44,894
I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

893
01:19:44,996 --> 01:19:47,226
- Negative, negative.
- Cannot identify.

894
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:49,959
Get me Colonel Rhodes from
Weapons Development down here now!

895
01:19:56,808 --> 01:19:58,537
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

896
01:19:58,643 --> 01:20:00,338
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

897
01:20:00,444 --> 01:20:02,639
Any high altitude surveillance
in the region?

898
01:20:02,747 --> 01:20:04,408
We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.

899
01:20:04,515 --> 01:20:06,176
So this thing just appeared
out of nowhere?

900
01:20:06,284 --> 01:20:07,615
How come it didn't show up
on the radar?

901
01:20:07,718 --> 01:20:09,686
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

902
01:20:09,787 --> 01:20:11,914
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.

903
01:20:12,089 --> 01:20:14,387
We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

904
01:20:14,492 --> 01:20:16,289
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

905
01:20:18,863 --> 01:20:21,798
- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.

906
01:20:25,369 --> 01:20:27,166
- Hello?
- Tony?

907
01:20:27,271 --> 01:20:28,966
- <i>Who's this?</i>
- It's Rhodes.

908
01:20:29,273 --> 01:20:31,298
- Sorry, hello?
- <i>I said it's Rhodes.</i>

909
01:20:31,409 --> 01:20:34,276
- Speak up, please.
- What in the hell is that noise?

910
01:20:34,378 --> 01:20:37,814
- Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
- Yeah, well, I need your help right now.

911
01:20:37,915 --> 01:20:39,280
<i>It's funny how that works, huh?</i>

912
01:20:39,383 --> 01:20:42,750
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

913
01:20:42,854 --> 01:20:44,481
a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

914
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:46,216
<i>Well, that's a hot spot.</i>

915
01:20:46,324 --> 01:20:48,792
<i>Sounds like someone stepped in</i>
<i>and did your job for you, huh?</i>

916
01:20:48,893 --> 01:20:49,951
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

917
01:20:50,061 --> 01:20:51,255
<i>I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.</i>

918
01:20:51,362 --> 01:20:53,125
- I thought you were driving.
- <i>Right, I was driving</i>

919
01:20:53,231 --> 01:20:54,994
<i>to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.</i>

920
01:20:55,099 --> 01:20:57,431
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

921
01:20:57,535 --> 01:20:59,002
- <i>Nope!</i>
- Bogey spotted!

922
01:20:59,103 --> 01:21:01,833
- Whiplash, come in hot.
- Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one

923
01:21:01,939 --> 01:21:05,306
right now, and it's about to be blown
to kingdom come.

924
01:21:06,043 --> 01:21:07,738
That's my exit.

925
01:21:12,516 --> 01:21:15,917
<i>Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.</i>
<i>I've got the bogey in my sights.</i>

926
01:21:16,153 --> 01:21:17,586
Whiplash One, what is it?

927
01:21:17,688 --> 01:21:18,985
<i>I've got no idea.</i>

928
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:21,422
- You have radio contact?
- <i>Non responsive, sir.</i>

929
01:21:21,525 --> 01:21:22,549
Then you are clear to engage.

930
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:25,596
<i>Hit it.</i>

931
01:21:30,468 --> 01:21:33,437
<i>That bogey just went supersonic.</i>
<i>I got a lock!</i>

932
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:39,443
- <i>Inbound missile.</i>
- Flares!

933
01:21:42,513 --> 01:21:45,073
<i>Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!</i>

934
01:21:59,397 --> 01:22:00,591
Deploy flaps!

935
01:22:01,832 --> 01:22:03,026
Holy!

936
01:22:03,134 --> 01:22:04,692
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

937
01:22:04,802 --> 01:22:06,326
The sat visual has been lost.

938
01:22:06,437 --> 01:22:08,098
<i>No way that's a UAV.</i>

939
01:22:08,205 --> 01:22:09,297
What is it?

940
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,964
I can't see anything.

941
01:22:11,075 --> 01:22:13,509
<i>Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.</i>

942
01:22:14,045 --> 01:22:16,605
<i>I think bogey's been handled, sir.</i>

943
01:22:26,023 --> 01:22:27,684
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Rhodey, it's me.</i>

944
01:22:27,792 --> 01:22:29,453
- It's who?
- <i>I'm sorry, it is me.</i>

945
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,822
<i>You asked.</i>
<i>What you were asking about is me.</i>

946
01:22:30,928 --> 01:22:32,395
No, see, this isn't a game.

947
01:22:32,496 --> 01:22:35,795
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

948
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,800
- You understand that?
- This is not a piece of equipment.

949
01:22:37,902 --> 01:22:40,666
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

950
01:22:40,805 --> 01:22:43,171
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

951
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:47,742
- <i>Mark your position and return to base.</i>
- <i>Roger that, Ballroom.</i>

952
01:22:49,981 --> 01:22:51,107
<i>On your belly!</i>

953
01:22:51,215 --> 01:22:53,080
<i>It looks like a man!</i>

954
01:22:53,317 --> 01:22:55,945
<i>Shake him off! Roll! Roll!</i>

955
01:23:04,028 --> 01:23:05,154
<i>I'm hit! I'm hit!</i>

956
01:23:05,262 --> 01:23:07,526
It's confirmed. He has been hit.

957
01:23:11,702 --> 01:23:13,670
<i>Punch out! Punch out!</i>

958
01:23:20,111 --> 01:23:21,840
<i>Whiplash One down.</i>

959
01:23:21,946 --> 01:23:23,470
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

960
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:25,811
<i>Negative! No chute, no chute!</i>

961
01:23:31,355 --> 01:23:32,720
<i>My chute's jammed!</i>

962
01:23:38,763 --> 01:23:41,095
<i>Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.</i>

963
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:43,792
Whiplash Two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

964
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:48,167
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

965
01:23:48,272 --> 01:23:50,331
- Call off the Raptors.
- That thing just took out an F-22

966
01:23:50,441 --> 01:23:51,772
inside a legal no fly zone!

967
01:23:51,876 --> 01:23:54,174
Whiplash Two,
if you have a clear shot, take it!

968
01:23:54,278 --> 01:23:56,644
<i>You've been reengaged.</i>
<i>Execute evasive maneuver.</i>

969
01:23:56,747 --> 01:23:58,078
Keep going!

970
01:24:05,723 --> 01:24:07,714
<i>Good chute! Good chute!</i>

971
01:24:15,366 --> 01:24:18,199
- Tony, you still there?
- <i>Hey, thanks.</i>

972
01:24:18,302 --> 01:24:20,862
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

973
01:24:21,705 --> 01:24:23,104
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

974
01:24:24,909 --> 01:24:27,343
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

975
01:24:27,445 --> 01:24:29,003
<i>Now are you going to come by</i>
<i>and see what I'm working on?</i>

976
01:24:29,113 --> 01:24:31,980
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

977
01:24:32,149 --> 01:24:33,673
Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

978
01:24:33,784 --> 01:24:36,275
<i>Training exercise.</i>
<i>Isn't that the usual BS?</i>

979
01:24:36,387 --> 01:24:38,082
<i>It's not that simple.</i>

980
01:24:38,923 --> 01:24:40,720
An unfortunate training exercise

981
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:43,692
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

982
01:24:44,462 --> 01:24:47,829
I am pleased to report
that the pilot was not injured.

983
01:24:47,932 --> 01:24:51,834
<i>As for the unexpected turn of events</i>
<i>on the ground in Gulmira,</i>

984
01:24:51,936 --> 01:24:55,428
<i>it is still unclear</i>
<i>who or what intervened,</i>

985
01:24:55,539 --> 01:24:59,635
<i>but I can assure you that the United</i>
<i>States government was not involved.</i>

986
01:25:01,712 --> 01:25:02,770
Hey!

987
01:25:04,715 --> 01:25:06,546
<i>It is a tight fit, sir.</i>

988
01:25:07,585 --> 01:25:10,452
<i>Sir, the more you struggle,</i>
<i>the more this is going to hurt.</i>

989
01:25:10,554 --> 01:25:12,454
Be gentle. This is my first time.

990
01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:16,154
I designed this to come off, so... Hey.

991
01:25:17,461 --> 01:25:21,158
- I really should be able to...
- <i>Please, try not to move, sir.</i>

992
01:25:22,766 --> 01:25:25,030
What's going on here?

993
01:25:29,607 --> 01:25:33,634
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

994
01:25:34,211 --> 01:25:36,076
Are those bullet holes?

995
01:26:03,574 --> 01:26:04,768
Welcome.

996
01:26:08,179 --> 01:26:10,238
Compliments of Tony Stark.

997
01:26:11,215 --> 01:26:14,844
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

998
01:26:14,952 --> 01:26:17,011
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

999
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:18,850
Show me the weapon.

1000
01:26:20,124 --> 01:26:23,560
Come. Leave your guards outside.

1001
01:26:40,377 --> 01:26:42,868
His escape bore unexpected fruit.

1002
01:26:45,583 --> 01:26:47,517
So this is how he did it.

1003
01:26:47,885 --> 01:26:50,353
This is only a first, crude effort.

1004
01:26:50,588 --> 01:26:52,852
Stark has perfected his design.

1005
01:26:53,324 --> 01:26:55,792
He has made a masterpiece of death.

1006
01:26:56,493 --> 01:26:59,621
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

1007
01:27:01,265 --> 01:27:03,563
And you dream of Stark's throne.

1008
01:27:05,402 --> 01:27:07,597
We have a common enemy.

1009
01:27:11,942 --> 01:27:13,876
If we are still in business,

1010
01:27:16,447 --> 01:27:18,608
I will give you these designs

1011
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:21,117
as a gift.

1012
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:24,185
And in turn,

1013
01:27:25,889 --> 01:27:30,952
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

1014
01:27:47,945 --> 01:27:49,276
Technology.

1015
01:27:51,181 --> 01:27:54,673
It's always been your Achilles' heel
in this part of the world.

1016
01:27:55,919 --> 01:27:59,047
Don't worry. It'll only last for 15 minutes.

1017
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:02,691
That's the least of your problems.

1018
01:28:07,965 --> 01:28:10,559
Crate up the armor and the rest of it.

1019
01:28:12,236 --> 01:28:14,227
All right, let's finish up here.

1020
01:28:18,208 --> 01:28:21,143
Set up Sector 16
underneath the arc reactor,

1021
01:28:21,245 --> 01:28:24,737
and I'm going to want this data masked.
Recruit our top engineers.

1022
01:28:24,848 --> 01:28:26,713
I want a prototype right away.

1023
01:28:34,925 --> 01:28:38,053
Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

1024
01:28:38,162 --> 01:28:40,357
I need you to go to my office.

1025
01:28:40,898 --> 01:28:43,298
You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all

1026
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,994
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

1027
01:28:46,103 --> 01:28:47,661
This'll get you in.

1028
01:28:47,771 --> 01:28:49,329
It's probably under Executive Files.

1029
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,806
If not, they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need

1030
01:28:51,909 --> 01:28:54,571
to look for the lowest numeric heading.

1031
01:28:54,878 --> 01:28:57,346
And what do you plan to do with
this information if I bring it back here?

1032
01:28:57,448 --> 01:28:58,472
Same drill.

1033
01:28:58,582 --> 01:29:00,573
They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

1034
01:29:00,684 --> 01:29:03,744
I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

1035
01:29:04,722 --> 01:29:05,746
Tony,

1036
01:29:08,092 --> 01:29:09,957
you know that
I would help you with anything,

1037
01:29:10,060 --> 01:29:14,019
but I cannot help you if
you're going to start all of this again.

1038
01:29:14,131 --> 01:29:17,692
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

1039
01:29:18,001 --> 01:29:21,164
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

1040
01:29:22,339 --> 01:29:25,365
There is the next mission
and nothing else.

1041
01:29:26,610 --> 01:29:27,941
Is that so?

1042
01:29:30,147 --> 01:29:31,614
Well, then, I quit.

1043
01:29:34,718 --> 01:29:36,310
You stood by my side all these years

1044
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:39,218
while I reaped
the benefits of destruction.

1045
01:29:39,556 --> 01:29:41,387
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

1046
01:29:41,492 --> 01:29:43,289
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

1047
01:29:43,394 --> 01:29:47,831
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not going to be a part of it.

1048
01:29:47,931 --> 01:29:49,899
I shouldn't be alive,

1049
01:29:51,235 --> 01:29:53,328
unless it was for a reason.

1050
01:29:54,204 --> 01:29:56,035
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1051
01:29:56,573 --> 01:29:59,701
I just finally know what I have to do.

1052
01:30:04,081 --> 01:30:06,845
And I know in my heart that it's right.

1053
01:30:22,599 --> 01:30:24,999
You're all I have, too, you know.

1054
01:31:34,471 --> 01:31:39,238
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1055
01:31:52,189 --> 01:31:56,489
<i>You did not tell us that the target you</i>
<i>paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.</i>

1056
01:31:56,593 --> 01:31:58,117
- <i>As you can see, Obadiah Stane...</i>
- Oh, my God.

1057
01:31:58,228 --> 01:32:00,924
<i>... your deception and lies</i>
<i>will cost you dearly.</i>

1058
01:32:01,031 --> 01:32:03,693
<i>The price to kill Tony Stark</i>
<i>has just gone up.</i>

1059
01:32:07,738 --> 01:32:12,107
So, what are we going to do about this?

1060
01:32:24,121 --> 01:32:27,386
I know what you're going through,
Pepper.

1061
01:32:35,132 --> 01:32:38,795
Tony. He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

1062
01:33:00,457 --> 01:33:04,826
I was so happy when he came home.

1063
01:33:04,928 --> 01:33:07,692
It was like we got him back
from the dead.

1064
01:33:10,767 --> 01:33:12,701
Now I realize,

1065
01:33:15,038 --> 01:33:18,269
well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

1066
01:33:20,043 --> 01:33:22,705
He left a part of himself in that cave.

1067
01:33:25,515 --> 01:33:27,073
Breaks my heart.

1068
01:33:29,419 --> 01:33:33,355
Well, he's a complicated person.

1069
01:33:36,093 --> 01:33:39,460
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

1070
01:33:45,802 --> 01:33:48,532
You are a very rare woman.

1071
01:33:51,074 --> 01:33:53,201
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

1072
01:33:55,979 --> 01:33:57,947
Thank you. Thanks.

1073
01:33:59,983 --> 01:34:01,974
I'd better get back there.

1074
01:34:07,491 --> 01:34:09,482
Is that today's paper?

1075
01:34:11,161 --> 01:34:12,185
Yes.

1076
01:34:12,996 --> 01:34:14,361
Do you mind?

1077
01:34:14,998 --> 01:34:16,795
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.

1078
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:18,197
Of course.

1079
01:34:21,705 --> 01:34:23,002
Take care.

1080
01:34:47,197 --> 01:34:50,064
Ms. Potts? We had an appointment.
Did you forget about our appointment?

1081
01:34:50,167 --> 01:34:51,657
Nope, right now. Come with me.

1082
01:34:51,768 --> 01:34:52,860
- Right now?
- We're going to have it right now.

1083
01:34:52,969 --> 01:34:54,732
- Yeah, walk with me.
- Okay.

1084
01:34:55,939 --> 01:34:58,100
I'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

1085
01:34:59,676 --> 01:35:02,474
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

1086
01:35:02,879 --> 01:35:06,371
Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have to call you back.

1087
01:35:06,616 --> 01:35:09,278
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored

1088
01:35:09,386 --> 01:35:11,616
what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.

1089
01:35:11,722 --> 01:35:13,383
- Actually...
- A hiccup?

1090
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:17,290
Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology actually doesn't exist.

1091
01:35:17,527 --> 01:35:20,655
- So it's...
- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

1092
01:35:20,764 --> 01:35:26,725
William, here is the technology.
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

1093
01:35:26,837 --> 01:35:30,796
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

1094
01:35:30,907 --> 01:35:37,471
Tony Stark was able to build this
in a cave! With a box of scraps!

1095
01:35:39,716 --> 01:35:42,742
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.

1096
01:35:58,902 --> 01:35:59,869
<i>Tony?</i>

1097
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:05,904
<i>Tony, are you there? Hello?</i>

1098
01:36:07,511 --> 01:36:08,705
Breathe.

1099
01:36:09,913 --> 01:36:12,609
Easy, easy.

1100
01:36:14,718 --> 01:36:16,982
You remember this one, right?

1101
01:36:18,722 --> 01:36:21,020
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

1102
01:36:21,124 --> 01:36:25,220
There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

1103
01:36:27,597 --> 01:36:28,825
Tony.

1104
01:36:31,168 --> 01:36:35,502
When I ordered the hit on you,

1105
01:36:38,141 --> 01:36:40,609
I worried that I was

1106
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:45,671
killing the golden goose.

1107
01:36:47,050 --> 01:36:50,781
But, you see, it was just

1108
01:36:52,155 --> 01:36:54,385
fate that you survived that.

1109
01:36:59,496 --> 01:37:03,330
You had one last golden egg to give.

1110
01:37:07,537 --> 01:37:12,804
Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

1111
01:37:16,746 --> 01:37:21,843
Your father, he helped give us
the atomic bomb.

1112
01:37:21,952 --> 01:37:26,184
Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

1113
01:37:36,199 --> 01:37:37,826
Oh, it's beautiful.

1114
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:45,271
Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.

1115
01:37:47,611 --> 01:37:50,045
What a masterpiece. Look at that.

1116
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:53,177
This is your legacy.

1117
01:37:55,752 --> 01:38:00,917
A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

1118
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:07,857
Weapons that will help steer the world
back on course,

1119
01:38:07,964 --> 01:38:10,194
put the balance of power in our hands.

1120
01:38:11,801 --> 01:38:13,393
The right hands.

1121
01:38:16,573 --> 01:38:21,067
I wish you could've seen my prototype.

1122
01:38:22,512 --> 01:38:23,979
It's not as...

1123
01:38:25,348 --> 01:38:28,317
Well, not as conservative as yours.

1124
01:38:30,387 --> 01:38:33,185
Too bad you had to involve Pepper
in this.

1125
01:38:33,657 --> 01:38:36,217
I would have preferred that she lived.

1126
01:38:49,272 --> 01:38:51,536
What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

1127
01:38:51,641 --> 01:38:54,235
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

1128
01:38:55,512 --> 01:38:56,774
Okay, where's Tony now?

1129
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,575
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

1130
01:38:58,682 --> 01:39:00,809
Please go over there
and make sure everything's okay.

1131
01:39:00,917 --> 01:39:03,477
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

1132
01:40:09,853 --> 01:40:11,115
Good boy.

1133
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,018
Tony?

1134
01:40:54,697 --> 01:40:55,755
Tony?

1135
01:40:57,567 --> 01:40:58,659
Tony?

1136
01:41:00,804 --> 01:41:01,896
Tony?

1137
01:41:04,607 --> 01:41:05,665
Tony!

1138
01:41:07,911 --> 01:41:10,141
Tony! You okay?

1139
01:41:10,547 --> 01:41:14,142
- Where's Pepper?
- She's fine. She's with five agents.

1140
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:16,548
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

1141
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:18,778
That's not going to be enough.

1142
01:41:42,645 --> 01:41:48,606
Section 16. Section 16. There it is.

1143
01:41:57,660 --> 01:42:00,322
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

1144
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:02,557
Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

1145
01:42:02,665 --> 01:42:04,064
It's, like, a thing that's going
to pick the lock?

1146
01:42:04,167 --> 01:42:06,863
You might want to take
a few steps back.

1147
01:42:25,488 --> 01:42:27,979
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

1148
01:42:28,091 --> 01:42:30,855
Not bad, huh? Let's do it.

1149
01:42:37,567 --> 01:42:39,899
You need me to do anything else?

1150
01:42:40,537 --> 01:42:42,300
<i>Keep the skies clear.</i>

1151
01:42:47,477 --> 01:42:48,705
Damn!

1152
01:42:56,819 --> 01:42:58,411
Next time, baby.

1153
01:43:28,585 --> 01:43:31,918
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

1154
01:43:32,555 --> 01:43:34,523
I thought it'd be bigger.

1155
01:44:31,281 --> 01:44:33,249
How do you think the Mark One
chest piece is going to hold up?

1156
01:44:33,349 --> 01:44:35,647
<i>The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.</i>

1157
01:44:35,752 --> 01:44:38,414
<i>That chest piece</i>
<i>was never designed for sustained flight.</i>

1158
01:44:38,521 --> 01:44:40,011
Keep me posted.

1159
01:44:41,824 --> 01:44:42,791
<i>Pepper!</i>

1160
01:44:42,892 --> 01:44:45,884
- Tony! Tony, are you okay?
- <i>I'm fine. How are...</i>

1161
01:44:45,995 --> 01:44:47,895
- Obadiah, he's gone insane!
- <i>I know.</i>

1162
01:44:47,997 --> 01:44:49,760
- <i>Listen, you'd better get out of there.</i>
- He built a suit.

1163
01:44:49,866 --> 01:44:51,299
<i>Get out of there right now!</i>

1164
01:45:03,179 --> 01:45:05,477
<i>Where do you think you're going?</i>

1165
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:13,989
<i>Your services are no longer required.</i>

1166
01:45:14,223 --> 01:45:15,656
<i>Stane!</i>

1167
01:45:40,883 --> 01:45:42,544
<i>I love this suit!</i>

1168
01:45:42,652 --> 01:45:45,849
- <i>Put them down!</i>
- <i>Collateral damage, Tony.</i>

1169
01:45:47,423 --> 01:45:49,448
Divert power to chest RT.

1170
01:45:58,201 --> 01:46:00,294
<i>Power reduced to 19%.</i>

1171
01:46:08,177 --> 01:46:09,235
<i>Lady!</i>

1172
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:13,171
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

1173
01:46:35,271 --> 01:46:38,206
<i>For 30 years, I've been holding you up!</i>

1174
01:46:42,712 --> 01:46:45,112
<i>I built this company from nothing!</i>

1175
01:46:47,417 --> 01:46:49,942
<i>Nothing is going to stand in my way.</i>

1176
01:46:56,225 --> 01:46:57,817
<i>Least of all you!</i>

1177
01:47:08,204 --> 01:47:11,435
<i>Impressive!</i>
<i>You've upgraded your armor!</i>

1178
01:47:12,041 --> 01:47:14,737
<i>I've made some upgrades of my own!</i>

1179
01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:25,053
<i>Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.</i>

1180
01:47:25,154 --> 01:47:26,815
Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.

1181
01:47:26,923 --> 01:47:29,187
<i>With only 15% power,</i>
<i>the odds of reaching that...</i>

1182
01:47:29,292 --> 01:47:31,419
I know the math! Do it!

1183
01:47:39,735 --> 01:47:42,033
Sir, you're not going to believe this.
That thing is back.

1184
01:47:42,138 --> 01:47:44,732
Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!

1185
01:47:47,477 --> 01:47:50,446
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

1186
01:47:50,546 --> 01:47:51,774
Yes, sir.

1187
01:47:59,755 --> 01:48:01,655
- <i>Thirteen percent power, sir.</i>
- Climb!

1188
01:48:05,695 --> 01:48:07,686
- <i>Eleven percent.</i>
- Keep going!

1189
01:48:14,470 --> 01:48:16,563
- <i>Seven percent power.</i>
- Just leave it on the screen!

1190
01:48:16,672 --> 01:48:18,230
Stop telling me!

1191
01:48:27,950 --> 01:48:32,512
<i>You had a great idea, Tony, but my</i>
<i>suit is more advanced in every way!</i>

1192
01:48:33,122 --> 01:48:35,147
<i>How'd you solve the icing problem?</i>

1193
01:48:35,258 --> 01:48:36,725
<i>Icing problem?</i>

1194
01:48:38,961 --> 01:48:41,293
<i>Might want to look into it.</i>

1195
01:48:53,009 --> 01:48:54,271
<i>Two percent.</i>

1196
01:48:56,445 --> 01:48:59,312
<i>We are now running</i>
<i>on emergency backup power.</i>

1197
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:14,396
- Potts!
- Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

1198
01:49:14,497 --> 01:49:18,627
I'm almost out of power. I've got to get
out of this thing. I'll be right there.

1199
01:49:18,734 --> 01:49:20,099
<i>Nice try!</i>

1200
01:49:32,715 --> 01:49:36,344
- Weapons status?
- <i>Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.</i>

1201
01:49:41,090 --> 01:49:42,614
Flares!

1202
01:49:51,167 --> 01:49:53,192
<i>Very clever, Tony.</i>

1203
01:49:58,541 --> 01:50:01,009
- Potts?
- Tony!

1204
01:50:01,110 --> 01:50:02,077
This isn't working.

1205
01:50:02,178 --> 01:50:04,442
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

1206
01:50:04,547 --> 01:50:07,414
- Well, how are you going to do that?
- You're going to do it.

1207
01:50:07,516 --> 01:50:09,950
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

1208
01:50:10,052 --> 01:50:11,451
When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

1209
01:50:11,554 --> 01:50:14,114
You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

1210
01:50:14,223 --> 01:50:15,588
It's going to fry everything up here.

1211
01:50:17,793 --> 01:50:20,057
Okay. I'm going in now.

1212
01:50:20,162 --> 01:50:23,393
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof.
I'll buy you some time.

1213
01:50:32,942 --> 01:50:34,705
<i>This looks important!</i>

1214
01:50:55,631 --> 01:50:58,395
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

1215
01:50:58,501 --> 01:51:02,597
but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1216
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:13,348
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

1217
01:51:15,751 --> 01:51:17,844
You'd have made your father proud!

1218
01:51:22,858 --> 01:51:25,326
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1219
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:46,177
Tony!

1220
01:51:47,416 --> 01:51:49,008
How ironic, Tony!

1221
01:51:50,853 --> 01:51:55,722
Trying to rid the world of weapons,
you gave it its best one ever!

1222
01:51:55,991 --> 01:52:01,861
- Pepper!
- And now I'm going to kill you with it!

1223
01:52:04,934 --> 01:52:08,768
- You ripped out my targeting system!
- Time to hit the button!

1224
01:52:08,871 --> 01:52:12,830
- You told me not to!
- Hold still, you little prick!

1225
01:52:14,910 --> 01:52:17,435
- Just do it!
- You'll die!

1226
01:52:20,583 --> 01:52:22,050
Push it!

1227
01:53:19,642 --> 01:53:21,405
Tony!

1228
01:53:29,852 --> 01:53:31,945
<i>You've all received the official</i>
<i>statement of what occurred</i>

1229
01:53:32,054 --> 01:53:34,318
<i>at Stark Industries last night.</i>

1230
01:53:34,690 --> 01:53:39,184
<i>There have been unconfirmed reports</i>
<i>that a robotic prototype malfunctioned</i>

1231
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:41,888
<i>and caused damage to the arc reactor.</i>

1232
01:53:42,665 --> 01:53:44,895
<i>Fortunately, a member</i>
<i>of Tony Stark's personal security staff...</i>

1233
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,900
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1234
01:53:47,002 --> 01:53:50,631
I mean, it's not technically accurate.
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

1235
01:53:50,739 --> 01:53:53,367
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1236
01:53:53,475 --> 01:53:55,067
Here's your alibi.

1237
01:53:55,978 --> 01:53:57,036
Okay.

1238
01:53:57,146 --> 01:53:59,273
- You were on your yacht.
- Yeah.

1239
01:53:59,381 --> 01:54:01,474
We have port papers that put you
in Avalon all night,

1240
01:54:01,584 --> 01:54:03,279
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1241
01:54:03,385 --> 01:54:06,479
See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me

1242
01:54:06,589 --> 01:54:08,352
alone on the island.

1243
01:54:09,692 --> 01:54:10,954
- That's what happened.
- All right.

1244
01:54:11,060 --> 01:54:13,153
Just read it, word for word.

1245
01:54:15,097 --> 01:54:17,088
There's nothing about Stane here.

1246
01:54:17,199 --> 01:54:19,963
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

1247
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:23,304
Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.

1248
01:54:23,405 --> 01:54:25,896
But what about the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

1249
01:54:26,008 --> 01:54:28,875
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1250
01:54:28,978 --> 01:54:31,276
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.

1251
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:35,339
Just stick to the official statement,
and soon, this will all be behind you.

1252
01:54:35,451 --> 01:54:37,681
You've got 90 seconds.

1253
01:54:40,589 --> 01:54:42,216
Agent Coulson?

1254
01:54:42,925 --> 01:54:47,385
I just wanted to say thank you very much
for all of your help.

1255
01:54:47,496 --> 01:54:50,397
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1256
01:54:50,699 --> 01:54:54,032
- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1257
01:54:54,403 --> 01:54:55,529
Right.

1258
01:54:56,538 --> 01:55:00,406
- Let's get this show on the road.
- You know, it's actually not that bad.

1259
01:55:00,509 --> 01:55:02,773
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1260
01:55:02,912 --> 01:55:04,436
- You're not Iron Man.
- Am so.

1261
01:55:04,546 --> 01:55:06,980
- You're not.
- All right, suit yourself.

1262
01:55:07,082 --> 01:55:11,041
You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

1263
01:55:11,153 --> 01:55:13,678
She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always
be worrying that I was going to die,

1264
01:55:13,789 --> 01:55:16,155
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

1265
01:55:16,258 --> 01:55:19,955
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1266
01:55:21,697 --> 01:55:22,721
crazy about me.

1267
01:55:22,831 --> 01:55:24,492
Tell me you never think about that night.

1268
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:26,431
- What night?
- You know.

1269
01:55:29,405 --> 01:55:35,139
Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

1270
01:55:36,812 --> 01:55:42,375
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1271
01:55:42,484 --> 01:55:45,715
and you left me there, by myself?

1272
01:55:46,956 --> 01:55:49,447
Is that the night you're talking about?

1273
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:52,718
Thought so.

1274
01:55:55,464 --> 01:55:59,195
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1275
01:55:59,301 --> 01:56:02,793
<i>And now, Mr. Stark has</i>
<i>prepared a statement.</i>

1276
01:56:02,905 --> 01:56:05,931
<i>He will not be taking any questions.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

1277
01:56:10,145 --> 01:56:15,208
<i>Been a while since I was in front of you.</i>
<i>I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.</i>

1278
01:56:17,219 --> 01:56:20,245
<i>There's been speculation that I was</i>
<i>involved in the events that occurred</i>

1279
01:56:20,356 --> 01:56:21,618
<i>on the freeway and the rooftop...</i>

1280
01:56:21,724 --> 01:56:24,488
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

1281
01:56:24,593 --> 01:56:28,324
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,

1282
01:56:28,430 --> 01:56:31,524
- despite the fact that you...
- <i>I know that it's confusing.</i>

1283
01:56:31,633 --> 01:56:35,228
<i>It is one thing to question the official</i>
<i>story, and another thing entirely</i>

1284
01:56:35,337 --> 01:56:38,568
<i>to make wild accusations,</i>
<i>or insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

1285
01:56:38,674 --> 01:56:40,266
I never said you were a superhero.

1286
01:56:40,376 --> 01:56:45,678
<i>Didn't? Well, good, because that would</i>
<i>be outlandish and fantastic.</i>

1287
01:56:47,716 --> 01:56:50,947
<i>I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.</i>

1288
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:54,455
<i>With this laundry list</i>
<i>of character defects,</i>

1289
01:56:54,556 --> 01:56:55,989
<i>all the mistakes I've made,</i>

1290
01:56:56,091 --> 01:56:59,424
- <i>largely public.</i>
- Just stick to the cards, man.

1291
01:56:59,528 --> 01:57:01,155
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1292
01:57:03,298 --> 01:57:04,788
<i>The truth is</i>

1293
01:57:11,006 --> 01:57:12,473
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

1294
02:05:15,724 --> 02:05:16,952
Jarvis!

1295
02:05:17,058 --> 02:05:18,753
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

1296
02:05:22,230 --> 02:05:27,691
"I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

1297
02:05:28,069 --> 02:05:31,300
Mr. Stark, you've become part
of a bigger universe.

1298
02:05:31,406 --> 02:05:33,169
You just don't know it yet.

1299
02:05:33,708 --> 02:05:35,437
Who the hell are you?

1300
02:05:35,710 --> 02:05:38,007
Nick Fury,
Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1301
02:05:40,515 --> 02:05:43,450
I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.

1302
