1
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,113
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

2
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,824
Hey! Hey, guys!

3
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,742
Faster!

4
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,706
Hey, what you got under there?

5
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,545
- Hey, you want to race?
- Oh, please.

6
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,676
- Come on!
- Come on, let's go!

7
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:35,861
Come on!

8
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,862
- Please?
- Come on! Let's go! Come on!

9
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,941
Come on. Let's go.

10
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,490
Go faster! Faster!

11
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,031
Sorry, gentlemen.

12
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,973
This whole area is closed for
weapons testing for the next 24 hours.

13
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:00,045
That includes all on-base personnel.

14
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,909
Good afternoon, sir.

15
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,714
I'm afraid that goes for you, too,
Colonel, sir.

16
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,120
The Pentagon sent out revised...

17
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,606
Russians.

18
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,743
This ain't gonna be easy.

19
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,611
Not as easy as it used to be.

20
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,480
- Well, we've been through worse.
- Yeah? When?

21
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,486
Flensburg. There was twice as many.

22
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,886
- We were younger.
- I still am young!

23
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,218
We had guns.

24
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:56,125
Put your hands down, will you?
You're embarrassing us.

25
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,789
Bet you 500 bucks
we can get out of this.

26
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,536
Let's call it 100.

27
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,441
You recognize building, yes?

28
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,654
Drop dead.

29
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,097
I'm sorry.

30
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,496
I meant drop dead, comrade.

31
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,986
- Where was he found?
- In Mexico.

32
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,615
They were digging in the dirt,
looking for this stuff.

33
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,096
You're not from around here, are you?

34
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,761
Where is it you would imagine
I am from, Dr. Jones?

35
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,931
Well, the way you're sinking your teeth
into those wubble-u's,

36
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,441
I should think maybe Eastern Ukraine.

37
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,477
Highest marks.

38
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,570
Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko.

39
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,916
Three times
I have received Order of Lenin.

40
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:31,012
Also medal as Hero of Socialist Labor.

41
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,421
And why?

42
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:38,686
Because I know things.
I know them before anyone else.

43
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,995
And what I do not know, I find out.

44
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,771
Now, what I need to know now
is in here.

45
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:07,583
- You are a hard man to read, Dr. Jones.
- Ouch.

46
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:12,494
So, we will do this,
what is expression, old-fashioned way.

47
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,056
You will tell us.
You will help us find what we seek.

48
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,725
This warehouse
is where you and your government

49
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,523
have hidden all of your secrets, yes?

50
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,895
This is a military warehouse.
I've never been here before in my life.

51
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,730
Object we seek,
rectangular storage container,

52
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:55,535
dimensions 2 meters by 0.5 meter
by 66 centimeters.

53
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,701
Contents of box, mummified remains.

54
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,211
This is no doubt familiar to you.

55
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,715
What makes you think I've got any idea
what box you're talking about?

56
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,876
Because 10 years ago

57
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,978
you were part of the team
that examined it.

58
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,515
Look...

59
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:18,154
Even if I
knew what you were talking about...

60
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,722
You will help us find it.

61
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,537
Compass. I need a compass.

62
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,343
You know, north, south, east...

63
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,747
West.

64
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,980
No compass?

65
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,788
I need your bullets.

66
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,768
The contents of that box
are highly magnetized.

67
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,961
I need gunpowder.

68
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,971
You want my help or not?

69
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:18,050
Don't toy with me, Dr. Jones.
What is the point of all this?

70
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,022
If it's still magnetic,

71
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,323
the metal in this gunpowder
should point the way.

72
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,593
Shells. Give me some shotgun shells.

73
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,092
Pliers.

74
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,031
Drop the guns,
or Colonel Dr. Spalko is dead.

75
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,684
Why, Mac?

76
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,157
Well, what can I say, Jonesey?

77
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,559
I'm a capitalist, and they pay.

78
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:56,629
After all those years
we spent spying on the Reds?

79
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,103
I thought we were friends, Mac.

80
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:04,335
I've had a run of bad luck
with the cards lately, mate.

81
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,934
Awful. Bloody awful.

82
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,242
I can't go home empty-handed again.

83
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:15,112
No defiant last words, Dr. Jones?

84
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,784
I like Ike.

85
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,359
Put down gun.

86
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,855
You got it, pal.

87
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,189
Damn, I thought that was closer.

88
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,555
Come on. Come on.

89
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,107
He's not to get out of here alive!
Block the exits!

90
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,317
Don't get clever, Boris.
You don't know him.

91
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,450
Know him. Know him.

92
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,653
You don't know him!
You don't know him!

93
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,823
You don't know him! You don't know...

94
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,333
You did well.

95
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,860
Hello? Hello?

96
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:04,936
Hello!

97
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,438
Hey. I knocked. You guys got a...

98
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,287
Wait a minute.

99
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,084
<i>Come on, gang!</i>

100
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,172
Oh, that can't be good.

101
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:39,941
<i>All personnel,</i>
<i>it is now one minute to zero time.</i>

102
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,770
<i>Put on goggles or turn away.</i>

103
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:48,114
<i>Do not remove goggles or face burst</i>
<i>until 10 seconds after first light.</i>

104
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,687
That can't be good at all.

105
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:01,228
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

106
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,501
Sure! Great! Don't wait for me!

107
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,163
<i>Minus 15 seconds.</i>

108
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,649
<i>Minus 10 seconds.</i>

109
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:24,981
<i>Niner, eight, seven, six,</i>

110
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,854
<i>fiver, four,</i>

111
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,227
<i>three, two, one, zero.</i>

112
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:07,282
<i>I had no reason to believe</i>
<i>that Mac was a spy.</i>

113
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,690
He was Ml6 when I was in OSS.

114
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,662
We did 20, 30 missions together
in Europe and the Pacific.

115
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:15,164
Don't wave your war record
in our face, Colonel Jones.

116
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,167
We all served.

117
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,601
No kidding? What side were you on?

118
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:22,469
I don't think you recognize
the gravity of your situation.

119
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,042
You aided and abetted KGB agents

120
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:28,306
who broke into
a top-secret military installation

121
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,177
in the middle of the
United States of America, my country.

122
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,218
What was in the steel box they took?

123
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,015
You tell us. You've seen it before.

124
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,155
You mean that Air Force fiasco in '47.

125
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,526
I was tossed into a bus
with blacked-out windows

126
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:51,534
and 20 people
I wasn't allowed to speak to.

127
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,695
Hauled out in the middle of the night
in the middle of nowhere

128
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:56,330
on some urgent recovery project
and shown what?

129
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,465
Pieces of wreckage

130
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:02,240
and an intensely magnetic shroud
covering mutilated remains?

131
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:05,248
None of us
was ever given the full picture.

132
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,978
And we were threatened with treason
if we ever talked about it.

133
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:09,917
So, you tell me, what was in the box?

134
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,352
Indy, thank God.

135
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,686
Don't you know it's dangerous
to climb into a refrigerator?

136
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,487
Those things can be deathtraps!

137
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,028
Good to see you, too, Bob.

138
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,496
Relax, boys. I can vouch for Dr. Jones.

139
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,464
What the hell is going on?

140
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,263
KGB on American soil?
Who is that woman?

141
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,133
Describe her.

142
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,866
Tall, thin, mid-30s,

143
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,636
carried a sword of some kind,
a rapier, I think.

144
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,111
Yeah, that's her.

145
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,773
You sure she's here?

146
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,250
Here and gone. Who is she?

147
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,914
Irina Spalko,
she was Stalin's fair-haired girl.

148
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:48,891
His favorite scientist, if you can call
psychic research science.

149
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,052
General Ross...

150
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,357
She's leading teams from the Kremlin
all over the world.

151
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,590
Scooping up artifacts

152
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,360
she thinks might have
paranormal military applications.

153
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:59,437
- General Ross!
- Back off, Paul.

154
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:03,030
Not everyone in the Army's a Commie
and certainly not Indy.

155
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:07,544
What exactly am I being accused of,
besides surviving a nuclear blast?

156
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:08,738
Nothing yet.

157
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,747
But frankly your association
with George McHale

158
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:15,081
makes all your activities suspicious,
including those during the war.

159
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,087
Are you nuts?

160
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:20,420
Do you have any idea how many medals
this son of a bitch won?

161
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,493
A great many, I'm sure.

162
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,256
But does he deserve them?

163
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:30,323
Dr. Jones, let's just say for now
that you are of interest to the Bureau.

164
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,562
Of great interest.

165
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,210
Grooved Ware in the beginning
of modern drainage practices,

166
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,774
which we also see in Skara Brae
on the west coast of Scotland.

167
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,480
Skara Brae dates from 3100 B.C.

168
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,285
and was continuously occupied
for 600 years

169
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:56,224
until it was apparently
abandoned in 2500 B.C.

170
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,455
There's no clear evidence
as to why its occupants

171
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:03,364
decided to abandon
a perfectly healthy environment. Yes?

172
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:06,835
- May I have a moment, Professor?
- Yes.

173
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,404
Open up Michaelson. Review Chapter 4.

174
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,600
When I come back we'll discuss

175
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,644
the difference between
migration and exodus.

176
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,046
What?

177
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,550
You have no idea the pressure
coming from the Board of Regents.

178
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:25,953
The FBI showed up this morning,

179
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:28,617
ransacked your office,
searched all your files!

180
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,558
You're the dean of the college.
Why didn't you stop them?

181
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:31,890
They have no right.

182
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,397
They had every right!
They weren't vandals.

183
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,899
They were federal agents
with search warrants!

184
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:40,438
The university isn't gonna get itself
embroiled in that kind of controversy,

185
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,632
not in this charged climate.

186
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,108
So you're firing me.

187
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:50,477
A leave of absence is all.
An indefinite leave of absence.

188
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,106
- You are firing me.
- During which

189
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,050
they've agreed to continue to pay
your full salary for a period...

190
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,586
I don't want their money!

191
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:59,179
Please don't be foolish.

192
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,156
You don't know what I had to go through
to get that for you.

193
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,524
You went through? What exactly
did you have to go through, Charlie?

194
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:05,960
Henry...

195
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,964
I resigned.

196
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,336
Where will you go?

197
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:24,474
Train to New York,
overnight to London, for starts.

198
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:29,917
I might end up teaching in Leipzig.
Heinrich owes me a favor.

199
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,386
I'll wire you when I get settled.

200
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,150
You can send on the rest of my things.

201
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,418
I suppose
there's nothing to keep you here.

202
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,461
I barely recognize this country anymore.

203
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,622
The government's got us
seeing Communists in our soup.

204
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:45,260
When the hysteria reaches academia,
I guess it's time to call it a career.

205
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,395
How did Deirdre take the news?

206
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,769
How does any wife take such things?

207
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:53,002
The look on her face
was a combination of pride and panic.

208
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:56,080
I never should've doubted you,
my friend.

209
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:59,878
No, you have reason to question
your friends these days.

210
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,922
Brutal couple of years, huh, Charlie?

211
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,589
First Dad, then Marcus.

212
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,063
We seem to have reached the age
where life stops giving us things

213
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,327
and starts taking them away.

214
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,666
Just another half glass.

215
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,059
Hey!

216
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,369
Hey, old man!

217
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:30,598
Professor, hello! Hey!
Are you Dr. Jones?

218
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,472
You're running out of platform, kid.

219
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,772
Are you a friend of Dr. Oxley's?

220
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,245
- Harold Oxley? The archeologist?
- Yeah.

221
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:38,838
What about him?

222
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,010
They're going to kill him.

223
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,791
I haven't talked to Harold Oxley
in 20 years.

224
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,423
He's a brilliant guy.

225
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,395
He could put you to sleep
just by talking.

226
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:56,558
Yeah. Yeah. When I was a kid,
that's how I did get to sleep.

227
00:28:56,668 --> 00:29:00,570
Oxley's voice was better than
a glass of warm milk, you know.

228
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,606
The name's Mutt, Mutt Williams.

229
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:05,870
- Mutt? What kind of name is that?
- Yeah.

230
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,968
It's the one I picked.
You got a problem with it?

231
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,345
Take it easy.
What was your relationship to Oxley?

232
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:16,944
My dad died in the war.
Ox kind of helped my mom raise me.

233
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,990
You were saying
somebody's going to kill him?

234
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,993
Six months ago,
my mom gets a letter from the Ox.

235
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,530
He's down in Peru.

236
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,328
Found some type of skull,
a crystal skull.

237
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,064
Like the one that guy
Mitchell-Hodgkiss? Hedgkiss?

238
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:36,436
- The one he found.
- Nice jacket.

239
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:41,878
The Ox and I were obsessed with
the Mitchell-Hedges skull in college.

240
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,140
How do you know about it?

241
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,510
Are you kidding? It's all he talked about.

242
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,413
He'd talk about that thing
till the cows come home.

243
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,418
What's it? It's like an idol?

244
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,284
Deity carving. Mesoamerican.

245
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,482
There are a number of crystal skulls
in the world.

246
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,321
I saw one in the British Museum.

247
00:29:56,694 --> 00:30:00,289
Interesting craftsmanship,
but that's about it.

248
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,196
All right, well, laugh if you want.
Oxley said he found it this time.

249
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:07,260
He said this was real and he was off
to a place called Akator with it.

250
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:10,068
- Akator? He said that? You're sure?
- Yeah.

251
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:13,838
That's what he said.
He said Akator. What is it?

252
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,540
It's a mythical lost city in the Amazon.

253
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,618
Conquistadors called it El Dorado.

254
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:24,745
Supposedly, the Ugha tribe were
chosen by the gods 7,000 years ago

255
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:28,622
to build a giant city out of solid gold.

256
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,286
It had aqueducts and paved roads

257
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:36,459
and technology that
wouldn't be seen again for 5,000 years.

258
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:41,528
Francisco de Orellana disappeared
into the Amazon looking for it in 1546.

259
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,509
I almost died of typhus
looking for it myself.

260
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,409
I don't think it exists.

261
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,380
Why would Ox
want to take the skull there?

262
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:55,282
The legend says that a crystal skull
was stolen from Akator

263
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,320
in the 15th or 16th century,

264
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:01,017
and that whoever returns the skull
to the city temple

265
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,286
will be given control over its power.

266
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:07,228
Power. Right. So there's some
kind of power. What's the power?

267
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:10,392
I don't know, kid. It's just a story.

268
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:11,627
No.

269
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,664
From his letter, my mom thought
the Ox was off his rocker.

270
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:15,761
You know, smog in the noggin,

271
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,139
so she goes down there to find him,
only he'd already been kidnapped.

272
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,007
Now they've got her, too.

273
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,545
Now, Ox said
he hid that skull someplace,

274
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,878
and if my mom doesn't come up with it,
they're gonna kill them both.

275
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,077
Now, she said you'd help me.

276
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,980
Me? What's your mom's name again?

277
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,819
Mary. Mary Williams.
You remember her?

278
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,153
There were a lot of Marys, kid.

279
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,387
Shut up! That's my mother
you're talking about!

280
00:31:37,495 --> 00:31:39,258
All right? That's my mother.

281
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:42,333
You don't have to get sore all the time
just to prove how tough you are.

282
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,594
Sit down. Please. Sit down.

283
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,906
She said if anybody could find the skull,
it's you.

284
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:53,501
Like you're some type of...
Like a grave robber or something.

285
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:56,444
I'm a tenured professor of archeology.

286
00:31:56,547 --> 00:32:00,779
Oh, you're a teacher.
Well, that's gonna be a big help.

287
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,853
Anyway, she called me
two weeks ago from South America.

288
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,445
Said she'd escaped,
but they were after her.

289
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,217
She said she'd just gotten
a letter from the Ox

290
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,293
and mailed it to me
so I could give it to you.

291
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,759
Then the line went dead. I opened it.

292
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,296
I mean, the thing's pointless, though.
It's just gibberish.

293
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,764
It's not even English lettering.

294
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:16,993
See?

295
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,169
See those two bricks over there,
at the counter?

296
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,833
I don't think
they're here for the milkshakes.

297
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,410
Who are they?

298
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,146
Don't know. Maybe FBI.

299
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:31,977
Come quietly, Dr. Jones.

300
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,482
Make that KGB.

301
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:36,644
- And bring letter with you.
- Letter? What letter?

302
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,051
Letter Mr. Williams just give you.

303
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:40,090
Me? Do I look like a mailman?

304
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,886
We don't ask again.
Come now or we'll...

305
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:43,153
Or what?

306
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,492
Nice try, kid,
but I think you just brought a knife

307
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,096
to a gunfight.

308
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,828
Outside now.

309
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,400
- Hit this guy.
- Who?

310
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,975
Joe College. Hit him hard.

311
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,977
- Here, hold this.
- What?

312
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,843
That's my boyfriend!

313
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,777
Take it outside!

314
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:10,683
Get that greaser!

315
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,828
Your mom didn't escape.

316
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,695
They let her go,
so she could mail the letter

317
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,997
and you could bring it to me
and I could translate it!

318
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,003
Get on, gramps!

319
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,801
Go, go, go, go, go!

320
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:14,272
Better dead than Red!
Better dead than Red!

321
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:20,208
Better dead than Red!
Better dead than Red!

322
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:23,446
Better dead than Red!
Better dead than Red!

323
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:28,481
This is crazy!
Somebody's going to get hurt!

324
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,114
Left! Go left! Left!

325
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,100
Move, move! Move!

326
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,102
Split, split! Split, split!

327
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,608
- You're going too fast.
- That's a matter of opinion!

328
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,588
- Excuse me, Dr. Jones.
- Yes?

329
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:39,026
I just had a question on
Hargrove's normative culture model.

330
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,495
Forget Hargrove.

331
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,658
Read Vere Gordon Childe
on diffusionism.

332
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,895
He spent most of his life in the field.

333
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:49,873
If you want to be a good archeologist,

334
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,533
you got to get out of the library!

335
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,406
Who is that?

336
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:02,611
Francisco de Orellana,
the conquistador.

337
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,950
Remember, the guy who got lost
looking for the skull.

338
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,548
And just as I thought.

339
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,627
Koihoma.

340
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,161
What's that?

341
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:17,223
It's an extinct Latin American language.
Pre-Columbian syllabic base.

342
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:22,563
See. Diagonal stresses
on the ideograms. Definitely Koihoma.

343
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,504
- You speak it?
- Nobody speaks it.

344
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,942
It hasn't been heard aloud
in 3,000 years.

345
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:32,277
I might be able to read a bit though
if I walk it through Mayan first.

346
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,584
You know, for an old man,
you ain't bad in a fight.

347
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,415
Thanks a lot.

348
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,455
What are you, like, 80?

349
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,987
It's a riddle.

350
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,588
Leave it to Ox to write a riddle
in a dead language.

351
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:54,230
"Follow the lines in the earth
only gods can read

352
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:57,364
"which lead to Orellana's cradle

353
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,739
"guarded by the living dead."

354
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:02,711
- He's talking about the Nazca Lines.
- What are those?

355
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,144
Hold on here.

356
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:11,377
Geoglyphs. Giant ancient drawings
carved into the desert floor in Peru.

357
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,253
From the ground,
they don't look like anything.

358
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,953
But from the sky,
only the gods can read them,

359
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,860
because only gods live up there.

360
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:28,066
Oxley's telling us
the skull is in Nazca, Peru.

361
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,027
Finally. They saw him.

362
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,969
Ox wandered into town a couple
of months ago, raving like a madman.

363
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,472
Police locked him up in the sanitarium.
It's this way.

364
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,009
I took Spanish and I didn't understand
a word of that. What was it?

365
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,272
Quechua, local Incan dialect.

366
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,940
- Where'd you learn that one?
- Long story.

367
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,607
I got time.

368
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,117
I rode with Pancho Villa.
A couple of his guys spoke it.

369
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,881
Bullshit!

370
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,218
- You asked.
- Pancho Villa?

371
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,452
- Technically, I was kidnapped.
- By Pancho Villa?

372
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,018
It was the fight
against Victoriano Huerta.

373
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,292
- How old were you?
- About your age.

374
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,891
Your parents must've had a cow, huh?

375
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,129
It worked out.
Things were a little tense at home.

376
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,103
Yeah, me and my mom
aren't on the best of terms, either.

377
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,642
Treat her right, kid. You only get one
and sometimes not for that long.

378
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,040
It's not my fault. It's hers.

379
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,737
She just got P.O.'ed
because I quit school.

380
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,313
She thinks
I'm some kind of goof or something.

381
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,610
- You quit school?
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Tons of them.

382
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,844
Fancy prep schools
that teach you how to debate

383
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,613
and chess and fencing.

384
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,848
I'm great with the blade.
I just think it's a waste of time.

385
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,015
- You never finished.
- No.

386
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,753
Just a bunch of useless skills.
Wrong books.

387
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:33,193
'Cause I love reading.
Me and Ox used to read all the time.

388
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,731
But now I can pick them myself.
You get me?

389
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,427
- What do you do for money?
- Fix motorcycles.

390
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:41,232
Gonna do that
for the rest of your life?

391
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:43,863
Maybe I will, Teach.
You got a problem with that?

392
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,408
No. Not if that's what you love doing.

393
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,343
Don't let anybody tell you different.

394
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,244
This is it. Sister.

395
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,536
She says Ox isn't here.
She doesn't know where he is.

396
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:19,641
Some men came and took him away,
men with guns.

397
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,949
She says he was obsessed, deranged.

398
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,519
Drew pictures
all over the walls of his cell.

399
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:37,127
This riddle in Oxley's letter
doesn't make any sense.

400
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:42,860
"Follow the lines that only the gods
can read that lead to Orellana's cradle."

401
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,231
Cradle, cradle, birth.

402
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,328
Orellana wasn't born in Peru.
He was born in Spain.

403
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,339
He was a conquistador.
He came here for the gold.

404
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,840
What happened to him?

405
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:56,140
He disappeared along with six others.
Their bodies were never found.

406
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,604
He must have lost his mind.

407
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:37,618
Ox, man, what happened?
What happened?

408
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,456
This is not the Mitchell-Hedges skull.

409
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,864
Look at the elongated cranium.

410
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,727
And the same word

411
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:56,032
in different languages,
over and over again.

412
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:02,206
Return.

413
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,042
Return where?

414
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,139
Or return what?

415
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,741
You mean the skull?

416
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:11,343
Seems to have been on his mind.

417
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:14,083
Where was he supposed to return it to?

418
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,062
- Sweep.
- Yeah.

419
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,343
Ox didn't mean Orellana's birthplace.

420
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,851
Cradle has another meaning in Mayan.

421
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:47,913
Literally, it means "resting place,"
as in final resting place.

422
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,391
Ox meant Orellana's grave.

423
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:55,522
This drawing scratched into the floor
is the cemetery where he's buried.

424
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,594
You said Orellana vanished
and nobody ever found his grave.

425
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:02,468
Well, it looks like Harold Oxley did.

426
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,463
"Grave robbers will be shot."

427
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:37,540
Good thing we're not grave robbers.

428
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:48,645
- What are we looking for?
- I don't know yet.

429
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:52,622
Maybe an antechamber
off one of these barrows.

430
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,997
I think I just saw something!

431
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:12,371
Oh, you're jumping at shadows.

432
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,981
This way down.

433
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:30,452
- This way up.
- Yeah.

434
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,652
Those darts are poison!

435
00:45:58,355 --> 00:45:59,822
Stay there.

436
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:26,842
You're a teacher?

437
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,348
Part-time.

438
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:40,693
Dead end.

439
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,266
Maybe.

440
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:51,935
What are you doing?
Put that thing away.

441
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:54,476
Give me some light over here.

442
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,214
Bring it over here.

443
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,888
It's just a thing.

444
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,512
Dance on your own dime, will you?

445
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,648
One of the scorpions just stung me!
Am I gonna die?

446
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,851
- How big?
- Huge!

447
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,450
- Good.
- Good?

448
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:22,830
When it comes to scorpions,
the bigger the better.

449
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:26,300
A small one bites you,
don't keep it to yourself.

450
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:51,286
Their skulls. Look at their skulls, man.

451
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:55,024
Like the drawings in Oxley's cell.
Means we're getting closer.

452
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:57,191
That's crazy. Why is it like that?

453
00:48:57,301 --> 00:49:00,702
Nazca Indians used to
bind their infants' heads with rope

454
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:02,396
to elongate the skull like that.

455
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:05,100
- Why?
- Honor the gods.

456
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:08,439
No, no. God's head is not like that, man.

457
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:10,638
Depends on who your god is.

458
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:22,749
You're going nowhere fast.

459
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,232
Professor, this really
is a dead end. Look.

460
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:38,533
Hey!

461
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:58,819
Come on, genius. Bring the backpack.

462
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:19,210
- This is incredible.
- Unreal.

463
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,146
Don't touch anything.

464
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:29,524
Footprints. Somebody's been here.

465
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:32,527
Recently.

466
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,226
Two sets of prints.

467
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:42,434
Same size, could have been
the same person twice.

468
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,006
Not bad, kid.

469
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:55,677
One. Two.

470
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:59,119
Three. Four. Five. Six.

471
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,256
Seven.

472
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:07,020
Orellana and his men might've
made it out of the jungle after all.

473
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,263
Give me some light.

474
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,807
You don't have a knife, do you?

475
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:44,896
Looks like he just died yesterday.

476
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:47,697
It's the wrappings. They preserved him.

477
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:57,335
What just happened?

478
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:01,383
He's been wrapped up for 500 years.
Air doesn't agree with him.

479
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:10,457
Thanks.

480
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,663
I don't want to keep
borrowing yours all the time.

481
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,735
- That's fine.
- I was going to put it back.

482
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,500
Is this one open already?

483
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:49,064
It's him.

484
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:51,496
It's Orellana himself.

485
00:52:56,473 --> 00:53:00,773
They called him The Gilded Man.
His lust for gold was legendary.

486
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:03,877
It's odd.

487
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,050
Somebody's been here and gone.

488
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:15,148
But they left all this gold
and all the artifacts.

489
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,421
What were they looking for?

490
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:34,305
- Hold this.
- No. No.

491
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:56,891
Unbelievable.

492
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,540
No tool marks.

493
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:10,238
A single piece of seamless quartz.

494
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:14,642
Cut across the grain.

495
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:18,847
It's not possible, even with
today's technology, it would shatter.

496
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,420
Crystal's not magnetic.

497
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,054
Neither is gold.

498
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,631
What is this thing?

499
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:39,835
Maybe the Nazca Indians thought
this was their god.

500
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,776
- You think this is the one from...
- From Akator.

501
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:52,046
Maybe the Spaniards found this skull
along with all this other loot.

502
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:55,522
They were headed for their ships
along the shore.

503
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:59,928
Maybe the Indians caught up with them,

504
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,521
or they got to squabbling
amongst themselves

505
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:06,090
over their prize, kill each other off.

506
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:09,433
The Indians wrap them up
and bury them.

507
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:14,602
A couple of hundred years later,
Oxley shows up here, finds the skull.

508
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:18,306
Takes it away, maybe to Akator.

509
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,475
But then he returns it here.

510
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:25,281
Return.

511
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:28,516
Return, like he wrote
on the walls of his cell.

512
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:33,489
He put it back where he found it. Why?

513
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,115
- Hello, Jonesey.
- Hello, Mac.

514
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:35,688
You're lucky I turned up, Jonesey.

515
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,022
Dovchenko there wanted
to blow your brains out.

516
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:41,655
That's the third time I've saved your life.

517
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:43,858
Unshackle me. I'll give you a big hug.

518
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:46,868
You had a Luger
pointed at the base of your skull

519
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,733
the first time we met.

520
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:50,669
I had the situation under control.

521
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:53,242
- You owe me.
- What do you owe them?

522
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:56,806
After the war, when you turned,

523
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,073
how many names
did you give the Reds?

524
00:56:58,181 --> 00:56:59,512
You're not looking
at the big picture here.

525
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,607
How many good men died
because of you?

526
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:03,982
Eventually, they're gonna
let me out of this chair, comrade,

527
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:07,454
and when they do,
I'm going to break your nose.

528
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:10,856
"Comrade"?
You think this is about flags?

529
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,326
About uniforms?
You think this is about lines on a map?

530
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,193
It's just about money, isn't it?

531
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:17,061
No. Not only money.

532
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,570
A gigantic pile of money.

533
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,773
Don't worry about
what the Russians will pay.

534
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:28,844
It's nothing compared
to what's at Akator.

535
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,413
An entire city of gold.
It's what the conquistadors were after.

536
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:40,348
For God's sake, Jonesey, we'd be rich!
Richer than Howard Hughes!

537
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,925
Blood money, every nickel.

538
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:45,221
I need you to see the angle here, mate.

539
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:48,195
Be smart. Do the right thing.
Just like in...

540
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:52,591
Like in Berlin. Got me?

541
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:54,761
Just like in Berlin.

542
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:58,102
You want me to trot off,
or should we sing a song?

543
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:03,075
How fortunate our failure to kill you,
Dr. Jones.

544
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:06,171
You survive
to be of service to us once again.

545
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:09,217
Well, you know me, always glad to help.

546
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:13,847
"Now I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

547
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:17,521
You recognize those words?

548
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:22,030
It was your own Dr. Oppenheimer
after he created the atomic bomb.

549
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:23,496
He was quoting the Hindu bible.

550
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,659
It was nuclear intimidation.

551
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:29,761
But now this next level of weapon
is ours to have,

552
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,773
yours to fear.

553
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:34,343
Weapon? What weapon?

554
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:36,173
A mind weapon.

555
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:40,079
A new frontier of psychic warfare.
That was Stalin's dream.

556
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:46,812
Now I know why Oxley
put the skull back where he found it.

557
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:48,151
He knew you were looking for it.

558
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,249
That skull is no mere deity carving.

559
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,351
Surely you knew that
the moment you laid eyes on it.

560
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:55,488
It was not made by human hands.

561
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:57,327
Who made it, then?

562
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:02,070
Come on.

563
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,373
The body we found in New Mexico
was not the first.

564
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:10,344
We'd already dissected two others
from similar crash sites in Soviet Union.

565
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,175
Saucer men from Mars.

566
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:14,409
The legends about Akator are all true.

567
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:16,917
Early men could not have conceived it,
much less built it.

568
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:19,147
It was a city of supreme beings

569
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:22,315
with technologies
and paranormal abilities.

570
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:24,791
You got to be kidding me.

571
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:28,125
Why do you choose
not to believe your own eyes?

572
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,760
The New Mexico specimen
gave us hope.

573
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:38,705
Unlike the others we'd found,
its skeleton was pure crystal.

574
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:44,674
A distant cousin, perhaps. Maybe they,
too, were sent to find Akator.

575
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:47,841
Perhaps we're all searching
for the same thing.

576
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:54,882
- There is no other explanation.
- There's always another explanation.

577
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:59,223
The skull was stolen from Akator
in the 15th century.

578
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:00,455
Whoever returns it...

579
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:02,963
Returns it to the city temple
will gain control over its powers.

580
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:06,001
I've heard that bedtime story before.

581
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:09,094
It's a legend.
Why do you think Akator even existed?

582
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,639
You should ask your friend
that question.

583
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,971
We're certain he's been there.

584
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:16,238
Oxley?

585
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:33,292
Ox, it's me, Indy.

586
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:35,630
Ox?

587
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,600
Ox, you're faking it, right?

588
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:42,603
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears..."

589
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:46,698
Ox, listen to me, pal.
Your name is Harold Oxley.

590
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,242
You were born in Leeds, England.

591
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:51,074
You and I went to school together
at the University of Chicago.

592
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:54,411
And you were never this interesting.
My name is...

593
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:58,546
My name is Henry Jones, Jr.

594
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,081
What have you done to him?

595
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,420
We ain't done a thing.
It's the bloody skull.

596
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:06,723
He is the divining rod
that will lead us to Akator.

597
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,229
But we need someone
to interpret him for us.

598
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:13,996
His mind, it seems, is quite weak.
Let's hope yours is stronger.

599
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:20,973
The skull's crystal stimulates an
undeveloped part of the human brain,

600
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:23,204
opening a psychic channel.

601
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:27,373
Oxley lost control of his mind
by staring too long into its eyes.

602
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:32,045
We believe you can get through to him
after you have done the same.

603
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,919
I've got a better idea. You look at it.

604
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:38,084
The skull does not speak to everyone,
it seems.

605
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:42,055
Surely you're not afraid, Dr. Jones.

606
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:44,725
You've spent your entire life
searching for answers.

607
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:47,928
Think of the truth behind those eyes.

608
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,562
There may be
hundreds of skulls at Akator.

609
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:53,233
Whoever finds them
will control the greatest natural force

610
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,469
the world has ever known.

611
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:00,372
Power over the mind of man.

612
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:04,078
Be careful,
you might get exactly what you wish for.

613
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:05,654
I usually do.

614
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,287
Imagine.

615
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:45,053
To peer across the world
and know the enemy's secrets.

616
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:48,392
To place our thoughts
into the minds of your leaders.

617
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:51,058
Make your teachers
teach the true version of history,

618
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:53,829
your soldiers attack on our command.

619
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,867
We'll be everywhere at once,
more powerful than a whisper,

620
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:58,338
invading your dreams,

621
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,535
thinking your thoughts for you
while you sleep.

622
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:06,346
We will change you, Dr. Jones,

623
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,213
all of you, from the inside.

624
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:12,014
We will turn you into us.

625
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:16,888
And the best part?
You won't even know it's happening.

626
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,523
Return.

627
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,763
Return?

628
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:29,661
That's enough.

629
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:35,501
That's enough.
If he dies, we can't get there.

630
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:38,043
Cover it.

631
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:44,583
Henry.

632
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:47,379
You all right, Jonesey?

633
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,527
- You broke my nose!
- I told you.

634
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:59,329
Enough! You will speak to Oxley
and lead us to Akator, yes?

635
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:02,932
Take him outside.

636
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:11,472
- You all right, kid?
- They left my bike at the cemetery.

637
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:13,378
- Yeah, but you're all right?
- They left my bike.

638
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:16,918
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.

639
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:29,096
I'm ready. Don't give these pigs a thing.

640
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,756
You heard him.

641
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:34,325
Clearly I have chosen
the wrong pressure point.

642
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:37,201
Perhaps I can find a more sensitive one.

643
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:42,940
Get your hands off me,
you rotten Russki son of a bitch!

644
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,978
Indiana Jones.

645
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:53,319
About time you showed up.

646
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:55,287
- Mom!
- Sweetheart.

647
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,018
"Mom"?

648
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:58,457
What are you doing here?

649
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,620
Forget about me. Are you all right?

650
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,960
- "Mom"?
- Young man, I specifically told you

651
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,589
- not to come here.
- Marion is your mother?

652
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,725
You never wrote that.
You never said that in any phone calls.

653
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:08,997
Marion Ravenwood is your mother?

654
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:12,268
For God's sake, Indy, it's not that hard.

655
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,309
No, I mean, I just never thought...

656
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,968
I would have a life after you left.

657
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,546
- That's not what I meant.
- A damn good life!

658
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:22,209
- Well, that's fine.
- A damn good, really good life!

659
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:23,785
- Well, so have I!
- Yeah?

660
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:25,717
You still leaving
a trail of human wreckage,

661
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:27,220
or have you retired?

662
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:28,790
Why? You looking for a date?

663
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:31,121
With anybody but you.

664
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:34,754
So, Dr. Jones, you will help us?

665
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:36,297
A simple "yes" will do.

666
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:38,867
Oh, Marion, you had to go
and get yourself kidnapped.

667
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:41,061
Not like you did any better.

668
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:44,468
Same old, same old.

669
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:48,836
Henry Jones, Jr.

670
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:54,071
- Henry Jones, Jr...
- That's right, Ox. Listen to me.

671
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:57,152
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key

672
01:05:57,253 --> 01:06:00,086
- "that ope's the Palace of Eternity."
- Palace of...

673
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:02,657
It's from Milton.
He's said it before. Why?

674
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:05,249
Ox, you got to tell us
how to get to Akator

675
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:06,760
or they're gonna kill Marion.

676
01:06:06,862 --> 01:06:11,162
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears,
here in death's dream kingdom..."

677
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:11,701
Harold, they're gonna kill
Abner's little girl.

678
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:13,794
Harold, they're gonna kill
Abner's little girl.

679
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:16,963
You got to tell us how to get there.
We need...

680
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:26,576
Get me paper. Something to write with.

681
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,455
Autowriting! I should have seen this.

682
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:49,096
- Henry Jones, Jr.
- Right. That's right, Ox.

683
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:53,699
Three times it drops. The way down.

684
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,635
- Three times...
- Pictographs.

685
01:06:58,347 --> 01:06:59,871
Ideograms.

686
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,015
Good, Ox. Good.

687
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:23,898
Ox?

688
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:26,972
It's me, Ox.

689
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:32,571
It's Mutt, Ox. Hey, look at me.
Look at me. It's me.

690
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:35,511
It's me.

691
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:42,890
The wavy lines mean water, of course.
Closed eyes mean sleep.

692
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:47,258
The sun with the arc over the sky
stands for time, duration.

693
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:49,957
The word "now" is "until."

694
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,294
These two close together,

695
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,767
the horizon and the snake,
mean one thought.

696
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:56,861
The horizon stood for the world,

697
01:07:56,972 --> 01:08:00,237
but it didn't mean the Earth.
It meant big, great.

698
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:06,309
"The water sleeps
until the great snake."

699
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:09,407
These aren't just drawings,
they're directions. Get me a map!

700
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:15,757
The great snake is the Amazon,
of course,

701
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:18,850
but "sleep," what water sleeps?

702
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:26,366
Here! Sono.
The Portuguese word for "sleep."

703
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:28,460
Yes, good. Exactly.

704
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:34,573
He wants us
to follow this curve of the Sono

705
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:37,942
down to where it meets the Amazon
to the southeast.

706
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:39,810
After that, I'm not sure.

707
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:44,318
Kingdom of dreams, tears and eyes...
I have no idea what he means.

708
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,409
This could be the route, though.

709
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:47,853
It's a completely unexplored part
of the canopy.

710
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:54,353
Go, go, go, go, go! Come on!

711
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:03,097
- Kid, what the hell are we doing, kid?
- They were going to kill us!

712
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,435
- Well, maybe.
- Somebody had to do something!

713
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:07,805
- Something else would have been good.
- At least I got a plan.

714
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:11,277
This is intolerable.
Harold, for God's sake, keep up.

715
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:20,444
Mom?

716
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:23,389
- Stay back!
- Stop! Stop! Stop! Don't move.

717
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,050
Moving makes space,
space will make you sink.

718
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,355
No, I think I can get out if I can just...

719
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:28,020
Stop it!
You're pulling against a vacuum.

720
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,961
It's like trying to lift a car.
Just stay calm.

721
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:31,191
Okay, I'm calm.

722
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,597
- What is it? Quicksand?
- I'm calm.

723
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:34,669
- No, it's a dry sand pit.
- I'm sinking, but I'm calm.

724
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:36,761
Quicksand is a mix of sand,
mud and water.

725
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:38,703
And depending on the viscosity,
it's not as dangerous

726
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:40,104
- as people sometimes think.
- For Pete's sake, Jones,

727
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:41,767
we're not in school!

728
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:44,778
Don't worry. There's nothing
to worry about unless there's a...

729
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,240
A void collapse.

730
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:52,116
I'll go get something to pull you out.

731
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:54,052
Ox, don't just sit there.

732
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:56,852
For God's sake, man, go get help!

733
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,819
- Help?
- Help!

734
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:01,419
Help?

735
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,895
Help! Go!

736
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:08,300
Mutt can be a little impetuous.

737
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,463
It's not the worst quality in the world.

738
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:14,408
Keep your arms above the surface.
When the kid comes back, grab on.

739
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:17,604
- Indy, he...
- He's a good kid, Marion.

740
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,340
You should get off his back
about school.

741
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:21,507
- Mutt, I mean...
- Not everybody's cut out for it.

742
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:23,278
His name is Henry!

743
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:24,875
Henry. Good name.

744
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:26,454
He's your son.

745
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:30,116
My son?

746
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,057
Henry Jones the Third.

747
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:39,132
Why the hell
didn't you make him finish school?

748
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,863
- Mom, grab on! Grab it!
- Yeah.

749
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,268
I got it.

750
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:47,669
Come on, Mom! Pull, pull, pull, pull!

751
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:48,970
Pull!

752
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:53,175
Grab on.

753
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,780
- Grab it.
- Just grab it, Indy.

754
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,410
It's a rat snake!

755
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:01,455
- Rat snakes aren't that big.
- Well, this one is, all right?

756
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:03,149
It's not even poisonous. Now grab on!

757
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,750
- Go get something else.
- Like what?

758
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:07,590
Like a rope or something.

759
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:10,859
There's no Sears and Roebuck here!
Grab the snake!

760
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:16,465
- Maybe I can touch the bottom.
- There's no bottom. Now grab it.

761
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:18,506
No, I think I can feel it with my feet.

762
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:21,201
- Grab the snake!
- Stop calling it that!

763
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,971
It's a snake!
What do you want me to call it?

764
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:24,943
- Say "rope."
- What?

765
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:27,106
Say "grab the rope."

766
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,741
- Grab the rope!
- Grab the rope!

767
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:31,717
Hold tight. It's slimy.

768
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:33,713
Pull!

769
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:44,325
Get rid of that thing, will you, Son?

770
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:46,025
Afraid of snakes.

771
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,661
You are one crazy old man.

772
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:56,967
Why do you have to do everything
the hard way, Jonesey?

773
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:02,807
Good work, Ox. Thanks.

774
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:04,610
Help.

775
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:42,548
No. No, he was British.
My dad was an RAF pilot.

776
01:12:42,655 --> 01:12:44,919
He was a war hero,
not some schoolteacher!

777
01:12:45,024 --> 01:12:48,687
No, sweetheart.
Colin was your stepfather.

778
01:12:48,794 --> 01:12:50,591
We started dating
when you were three months old.

779
01:12:50,696 --> 01:12:52,027
He was a good man.

780
01:12:52,131 --> 01:12:56,295
Wait, wait, wait. Colin?
As in Colin Williams? You...

781
01:12:57,536 --> 01:13:00,027
You married him? I introduced you!

782
01:13:00,139 --> 01:13:03,199
I think you gave up your vote
on who I married

783
01:13:03,309 --> 01:13:06,210
when you decided to break it off
a week before the wedding!

784
01:13:06,312 --> 01:13:08,644
I think we both knew, Marion,
it wasn't going to work.

785
01:13:08,748 --> 01:13:11,182
You didn't know that.
Why didn't you ever talk to me about it?

786
01:13:11,283 --> 01:13:13,148
Because we never had an argument
I won!

787
01:13:13,252 --> 01:13:14,981
It's not my fault if you can't keep up!

788
01:13:15,087 --> 01:13:16,213
I didn't want to hurt you!

789
01:13:16,322 --> 01:13:18,950
For love of God, shut the hell up!

790
01:13:19,058 --> 01:13:23,017
Didn't you ever wonder years ago
why Ox stopped talking to you?

791
01:13:23,129 --> 01:13:24,824
He hated that you ran away.

792
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:26,329
Would you two just stop?

793
01:13:26,432 --> 01:13:29,993
Yeah, Marion, let's not let the kid see
mom and dad fight.

794
01:13:30,102 --> 01:13:32,229
- You're not my dad, okay?
- You bet I am.

795
01:13:32,338 --> 01:13:33,669
And I got news for you.

796
01:13:33,773 --> 01:13:35,764
You're gonna go back and finish school.

797
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:37,001
Really? What happened to,

798
01:13:37,109 --> 01:13:38,599
"There's not a damn thing
wrong with it, kid,

799
01:13:38,711 --> 01:13:39,973
"and don't let anybody else
tell you any different"?

800
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:41,307
You don't remember saying that?

801
01:13:41,413 --> 01:13:43,108
That was before I was your father!

802
01:13:43,215 --> 01:13:44,648
- You're not my father!
- Oh, yes, he is your father.

803
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:46,217
You should have
told me about the kid, Marion.

804
01:13:46,318 --> 01:13:47,546
I had a right to know.

805
01:13:47,653 --> 01:13:49,314
You vanished after that.

806
01:13:49,421 --> 01:13:51,912
- I wrote.
- A year later!

807
01:13:52,024 --> 01:13:55,824
By then,
Mutt was born and I was married!

808
01:13:55,928 --> 01:13:57,691
Why are you bothering to tell me now?

809
01:13:57,797 --> 01:14:00,129
Because I thought we were gonna die!

810
01:14:00,232 --> 01:14:01,494
Not yet!

811
01:14:15,981 --> 01:14:17,175
Got it?

812
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:22,848
Oh, shit.

813
01:14:35,301 --> 01:14:37,963
I'm sure I wasn't the only one
to go on with my life.

814
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:41,005
There must've been
plenty of women for you over the years.

815
01:14:41,106 --> 01:14:45,304
Yeah. There were a few,
but they all had the same problem.

816
01:14:45,411 --> 01:14:47,106
Yeah? What's that?

817
01:14:49,381 --> 01:14:51,144
They weren't you, honey.

818
01:15:15,574 --> 01:15:17,633
We got to get Oxley back,
get our hands on that skull

819
01:15:17,743 --> 01:15:20,940
and get to Akator before they do.
Grab the wheel.

820
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:34,785
What's he gonna do now?

821
01:15:34,894 --> 01:15:37,158
- I don't think he plans that far ahead.
- Yeah.

822
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:41,224
- Scooch over, will you, Son?
- Don't call me "son." Don't.

823
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,465
I think I'd cover my ears if I were you.

824
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:55,745
Duck! Duck!

825
01:15:59,385 --> 01:16:00,716
Move, move!

826
01:16:03,255 --> 01:16:05,382
Pull up next to that duck.

827
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:17,461
Henry Jones, Jr.

828
01:16:29,415 --> 01:16:30,882
Jones!

829
01:16:46,165 --> 01:16:47,860
Come on! Come on!

830
01:17:03,148 --> 01:17:04,445
Get down!

831
01:17:16,328 --> 01:17:19,263
Ox has got the skull.
Marion, take the wheel.

832
01:17:19,365 --> 01:17:20,627
That's not fair. She drove the truck.

833
01:17:20,733 --> 01:17:23,759
Don't be a child.
Find something to fight with.

834
01:17:33,612 --> 01:17:34,806
Jonesey!

835
01:17:48,193 --> 01:17:49,956
- Jonesey!
- Hi, Mac.

836
01:18:25,531 --> 01:18:28,625
- Indy. Indy! Indy!
- Shut up! Shut up!

837
01:18:28,734 --> 01:18:33,762
- You stupid son of a bitch! I'm CIA.
- CIA.

838
01:18:33,872 --> 01:18:37,467
I almost screamed it at you in the tent.
I said, "Just like Berlin."

839
01:18:37,576 --> 01:18:39,510
What were we in Berlin, mate?

840
01:18:39,611 --> 01:18:41,442
- Double agents!
- The skull!

841
01:18:41,547 --> 01:18:43,242
Throw me the skull!

842
01:18:45,451 --> 01:18:47,180
Throw me the skull!

843
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:09,608
Riposte.

844
01:19:09,608 --> 01:19:10,404
Riposte.

845
01:19:15,814 --> 01:19:17,907
Get on your front foot. Riposte.

846
01:19:18,016 --> 01:19:19,916
It's not a match, Mom.

847
01:19:45,811 --> 01:19:49,941
You fight like a young man,
eager to begin, quick to finish.

848
01:19:50,315 --> 01:19:51,873
Mutt, disengage!

849
01:20:31,356 --> 01:20:33,824
Hey! Hey, I got the skull!

850
01:20:33,926 --> 01:20:35,985
- Throw the bag! Throw it!
- Throw the bag!

851
01:20:36,728 --> 01:20:38,127
- Gun!
- Gun!

852
01:21:24,743 --> 01:21:28,076
What are you looking at, Daddy-o?
She's getting away!

853
01:22:26,438 --> 01:22:28,497
This is very dangerous.

854
01:22:56,468 --> 01:22:58,595
<i>Do svidanya,</i> Dr. Jones.

855
01:23:26,698 --> 01:23:28,131
Jones!

856
01:23:30,769 --> 01:23:31,963
Whoa.

857
01:23:32,938 --> 01:23:33,996
Whoa.

858
01:23:35,474 --> 01:23:36,532
Whoa!

859
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:42,647
Turn!

860
01:24:14,846 --> 01:24:16,177
- Siafu.
- What?

861
01:24:16,281 --> 01:24:17,976
Big damn ants! Go!

862
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:33,393
Run to the river!

863
01:24:53,652 --> 01:24:55,313
Get to the river!

864
01:25:04,396 --> 01:25:06,557
Jump in! Come on! Come on!

865
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:14,033
Mom, there's a cliff!

866
01:27:59,204 --> 01:28:01,695
- Jonesey, come on!
- Get in, Jones!

867
01:28:18,289 --> 01:28:20,484
- Mom, stop.
- Mom, slow down.

868
01:28:24,496 --> 01:28:25,656
- Honey, stop.
- Slow down, Mom.

869
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:27,425
- You're gonna go off the cliff.
- That's the idea.

870
01:28:27,532 --> 01:28:30,057
- Bad idea. Give me the wheel.
- Trust me!

871
01:28:30,168 --> 01:28:31,533
Slow down!

872
01:28:59,230 --> 01:29:02,859
- Don't ever do that again.
- Yes, dear.

873
01:29:13,978 --> 01:29:16,208
Three times it drops.

874
01:29:19,918 --> 01:29:22,443
Reverse. Put it in reverse! Full reverse!

875
01:29:22,554 --> 01:29:24,317
- I'm trying! I'm trying!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mom!

876
01:29:45,643 --> 01:29:47,133
The way down.

877
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:52,174
He means by land. He came by land.

878
01:29:54,753 --> 01:29:57,017
- Three times it drops?
- Three times it drops.

879
01:29:57,122 --> 01:29:58,453
What is he talking about?

880
01:29:58,556 --> 01:30:00,148
He means one!

881
01:30:02,994 --> 01:30:04,222
Two!

882
01:30:22,447 --> 01:30:23,744
Three.

883
01:30:57,682 --> 01:31:01,311
You okay? Babe? Let go.

884
01:31:01,419 --> 01:31:04,354
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears."

885
01:31:06,457 --> 01:31:08,652
"The golden vision reappears!"

886
01:31:12,363 --> 01:31:14,331
Gold. I'm in.

887
01:31:14,432 --> 01:31:19,028
Through eyes... Through eyes in tears.
We got to go through that waterfall!

888
01:31:21,105 --> 01:31:24,905
The skull has to be returned.
I'll do it. Nobody else has to come.

889
01:31:25,009 --> 01:31:27,170
Who cares?

890
01:31:27,278 --> 01:31:30,145
It's brought us nothing but trouble.

891
01:31:30,248 --> 01:31:32,682
Look what it did to him.

892
01:31:32,784 --> 01:31:35,947
- I have to return it.
- Why you?

893
01:31:36,054 --> 01:31:38,045
Because it told me to.

894
01:31:50,902 --> 01:31:55,271
- Ochre, iron oxide, charcoal.
- Oxy, stay with us.

895
01:31:55,373 --> 01:31:57,000
How old is this?

896
01:31:57,108 --> 01:32:00,236
Four or five thousand years.
Old as the pyramids.

897
01:32:00,979 --> 01:32:04,176
Look, sun worshippers,
like the Egyptians.

898
01:32:07,051 --> 01:32:10,248
This is fresh. These were just used.

899
01:32:24,235 --> 01:32:25,930
More worshippers.

900
01:32:26,037 --> 01:32:29,234
Yeah, but that's not
the sun they're worshipping.

901
01:32:35,413 --> 01:32:36,778
Someone came

902
01:32:40,051 --> 01:32:43,179
and taught the Ugha farming.

903
01:32:47,325 --> 01:32:48,792
Irrigation.

904
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:01,070
Ox, what is it?

905
01:33:17,889 --> 01:33:19,982
I think I understand, Ox.

906
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,993
Someone came?

907
01:33:48,052 --> 01:33:49,519
Are they the same?

908
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:51,451
There were more. Look.

909
01:33:55,393 --> 01:33:57,156
Thirteen in a circle.

910
01:34:04,502 --> 01:34:06,231
Show us the way, Ox.

911
01:34:55,019 --> 01:34:58,955
- Let's go. Go, go, go! Run! Run, go!
- Go!

912
01:35:29,554 --> 01:35:31,317
Indy!

913
01:35:31,422 --> 01:35:33,982
Jonesey!

914
01:35:34,092 --> 01:35:35,491
Oxley!

915
01:35:36,527 --> 01:35:39,519
You were here before.
How did you get past them?

916
01:35:51,209 --> 01:35:54,303
Come on, Mac. Come on!
Come on, Mac.

917
01:35:57,115 --> 01:35:58,173
Come on, come on, come on.

918
01:35:58,282 --> 01:35:59,681
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key

919
01:35:59,784 --> 01:36:01,376
- "that ope's the Palace of Eternity."
- Come on, Ox.

920
01:36:01,486 --> 01:36:02,578
You did good, Ox. You did good.

921
01:36:26,978 --> 01:36:30,038
City of gold. So where's all the gold?

922
01:36:31,415 --> 01:36:33,280
Look at the state of this place.

923
01:36:33,384 --> 01:36:36,148
What a stupid legend.
What a waste of my time.

924
01:36:36,254 --> 01:36:41,055
Ox was here before,
but he couldn't get into the temple,

925
01:36:41,159 --> 01:36:44,925
so he took the skull back
to the cemetery, where he found it.

926
01:36:45,763 --> 01:36:49,164
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key

927
01:36:49,267 --> 01:36:51,565
"that ope's the Palace of Eternity."

928
01:36:51,669 --> 01:36:54,137
Key that ope's the palace.

929
01:36:55,506 --> 01:36:58,100
The obelisk. The obelisk is the key?

930
01:37:05,650 --> 01:37:07,982
What are you looking for, Ox?

931
01:37:10,221 --> 01:37:11,916
What are you doing?

932
01:37:16,861 --> 01:37:20,490
You figured this out in your cell,
didn't you, Professor?

933
01:37:21,465 --> 01:37:23,228
Excuse me, Professor.

934
01:37:38,316 --> 01:37:39,613
Well done.

935
01:37:40,851 --> 01:37:42,546
Go get your own.

936
01:38:41,779 --> 01:38:43,110
Listen.

937
01:38:44,649 --> 01:38:46,082
Hear that?

938
01:38:48,552 --> 01:38:50,679
Get up! Move! Ox, move!

939
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:57,355
Faster! Faster!

940
01:38:57,461 --> 01:38:59,691
Faster! Faster!

941
01:38:59,797 --> 01:39:01,355
Faster!

942
01:39:01,465 --> 01:39:03,729
This is not good. Move, Ox! Move!

943
01:39:04,402 --> 01:39:06,199
Quick! Quick! Quick!

944
01:39:08,673 --> 01:39:11,267
I don't like this! I don't like it!

945
01:39:11,375 --> 01:39:13,343
- Mom, come on!
- Jonesey!

946
01:39:30,695 --> 01:39:32,993
He dropped it. He dropped the skull!

947
01:39:33,097 --> 01:39:34,291
Okay?

948
01:39:44,675 --> 01:39:45,972
Hold this.

949
01:39:49,447 --> 01:39:51,074
Ox, you okay?

950
01:39:54,919 --> 01:39:56,079
Lovely.

951
01:39:57,288 --> 01:39:59,119
All right, let's go.

952
01:40:06,197 --> 01:40:07,425
This way?

953
01:41:14,598 --> 01:41:16,532
Now that's more like it.

954
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:26,542
There are artifacts
from every era of early history.

955
01:41:26,644 --> 01:41:28,771
Macedonian.

956
01:41:28,913 --> 01:41:31,473
- Sumerian.
- This place is the mother lode.

957
01:41:31,582 --> 01:41:33,550
Etruscan. Babylonian.

958
01:41:33,651 --> 01:41:37,712
There isn't a museum in the world
that wouldn't sell its soul for this lot.

959
01:41:37,855 --> 01:41:38,913
Early Egyptian.

960
01:41:39,023 --> 01:41:41,958
Dozens of museums.
Hundreds of them, Jonesey!

961
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:44,191
Collectors.

962
01:41:46,764 --> 01:41:48,698
They were archeologists.

963
01:42:26,370 --> 01:42:27,997
How do we open it?

964
01:42:33,511 --> 01:42:36,776
I'll give it back, Ox. I promise.

965
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:58,654
No more forever waiting.

966
01:44:00,097 --> 01:44:01,689
Soon now.

967
01:44:11,508 --> 01:44:13,408
Sorry, Jonesey.

968
01:44:13,510 --> 01:44:16,172
So what are you, a triple agent?

969
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:19,545
Nah, I just lied about being a double.

970
01:44:24,955 --> 01:44:26,684
Look at them!

971
01:44:28,792 --> 01:44:33,422
Still waiting for the return
of the one who was lost.

972
01:44:37,768 --> 01:44:39,668
They are a hive mind.

973
01:44:41,672 --> 01:44:46,302
One being physically separate,
but with a collective consciousness.

974
01:44:48,145 --> 01:44:51,342
More powerful together
than they can ever be apart.

975
01:45:00,391 --> 01:45:02,951
Imagine what they could tell us.

976
01:45:03,093 --> 01:45:04,788
I can't imagine.

977
01:45:04,895 --> 01:45:06,385
Neither could the humans
that built this temple,

978
01:45:06,497 --> 01:45:07,521
and neither can you.

979
01:45:07,631 --> 01:45:11,123
Belief, Dr. Jones,
is a gift you have yet to receive.

980
01:45:12,703 --> 01:45:14,227
My sympathies.

981
01:45:14,338 --> 01:45:17,933
Oh, I believe, sister.
That's why I'm down here.

982
01:45:52,776 --> 01:45:56,007
- Mayan. He's speaking Mayan.
- What does he say?

983
01:45:56,113 --> 01:45:58,741
He says he's grateful and he wants...

984
01:46:00,918 --> 01:46:02,044
It.

985
01:46:05,389 --> 01:46:09,155
It wants to give us a gift.

986
01:46:12,062 --> 01:46:13,825
A big gift.

987
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:17,292
Tell me everything you know.

988
01:46:21,371 --> 01:46:24,204
I want to know everything.
I want to know.

989
01:46:32,416 --> 01:46:34,884
I've got a bad feeling about this.

990
01:46:39,556 --> 01:46:40,887
Indy?

991
01:46:41,759 --> 01:46:43,021
The eyes.

992
01:47:47,691 --> 01:47:49,386
What are they? Spacemen?

993
01:47:49,827 --> 01:47:53,194
Interdimensional beings, in point of fact.

994
01:47:53,297 --> 01:47:55,060
Welcome back, Ox.

995
01:48:06,543 --> 01:48:08,170
What the hell is that?

996
01:48:08,278 --> 01:48:11,577
A portal!
A pathway to another dimension!

997
01:48:12,549 --> 01:48:15,109
I don't think we want to go that way.

998
01:48:30,701 --> 01:48:32,328
I want to know.

999
01:48:33,303 --> 01:48:34,793
I want to know.

1000
01:48:36,206 --> 01:48:39,801
Tell me. I'm ready. I want to know.

1001
01:48:46,116 --> 01:48:49,415
Mac! Mac! Come on!

1002
01:48:51,288 --> 01:48:52,346
Mac!

1003
01:48:54,858 --> 01:48:56,519
Mac, damn it, now!

1004
01:49:09,439 --> 01:49:10,838
I can see.

1005
01:49:12,776 --> 01:49:14,073
I can see!

1006
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:18,374
Grab it!

1007
01:49:23,287 --> 01:49:26,051
Use your legs, Mac. I can't do it alone.

1008
01:49:27,991 --> 01:49:29,356
Jonesey!

1009
01:49:30,861 --> 01:49:32,852
I'm going to be all right.

1010
01:49:41,538 --> 01:49:42,732
No more!

1011
01:49:46,243 --> 01:49:48,438
Cover it. Cover it.

1012
01:50:01,892 --> 01:50:02,950
Go!

1013
01:50:03,060 --> 01:50:04,721
Enough!

1014
01:50:05,262 --> 01:50:07,025
Enough!

1015
01:50:19,843 --> 01:50:21,310
Go! Go!

1016
01:52:41,685 --> 01:52:44,085
Like a broom to their footprints.

1017
01:52:46,756 --> 01:52:50,123
Where did they go? Space?

1018
01:52:50,994 --> 01:52:56,125
Not into space.
Into the space between spaces.

1019
01:53:04,975 --> 01:53:06,704
I don't understand.

1020
01:53:08,345 --> 01:53:11,246
Why this legend of a city of gold?

1021
01:53:11,348 --> 01:53:14,476
The Ugha word for gold
translates as "treasure."

1022
01:53:15,519 --> 01:53:18,647
But their treasure wasn't gold.
It was knowledge.

1023
01:53:19,523 --> 01:53:21,684
Knowledge was their treasure.

1024
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:39,704
What? We're just going to sit here?

1025
01:53:39,809 --> 01:53:41,470
Night falls quick in the jungle, kid.

1026
01:53:41,578 --> 01:53:43,478
You don't want to
climb down the mountain in the dark.

1027
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:44,774
No?

1028
01:53:46,082 --> 01:53:49,540
I can. Who's coming with me?
Come on.

1029
01:53:49,653 --> 01:53:52,121
Why don't you stick around, Junior?

1030
01:53:54,658 --> 01:53:57,593
I don't know. Why didn't you, Dad?

1031
01:53:59,729 --> 01:54:01,162
Dad!

1032
01:54:04,801 --> 01:54:06,098
Dad?

1033
01:54:11,107 --> 01:54:13,632
Somewhere your grandpa is laughing.

1034
01:54:30,393 --> 01:54:34,056
Marvelous! Perfect!
Make the letters bigger, much bigger.

1035
01:54:46,810 --> 01:54:50,541
Henry Jones, Jr.,
and Marion Ravenwood,

1036

insomuch in that you two have agreed
to live together in holy matrimony,

1037
01:54:55,752 --> 01:54:58,915
have promised your love for each other
by these vows

Whom God hath put together,
let no one tear asunder.

is lost in waiting!"
