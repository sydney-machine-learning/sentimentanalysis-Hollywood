1
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:38,320
This is Harvey Milk speaking
on Friday, November 18th.

2
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:44,152
This is only to be played in the
event of my death by assassination.

3
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,335
During one of
my early campaigns,

4
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:56,308
I began to open speeches with a line
and it became kind of a signature.

5
00:02:56,976 --> 00:03:00,007
<i>My name is Harvey Milk and</i>
<i>I want to recruit you.</i>

6
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:06,443
If I was speaking to a
slightly hostile audience

7
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,580
or a mostly straight one, I might
break the tension with a joke.

8
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,490
I know. I know I'm
not what you expected,

9
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,152
but I left my
high heels at home.

10
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:24,069
I fully realize that a person
who stands for what I stand for,

11
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,604
an activist,
a gay activist,

12
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,468
<i>makes himself the target</i>
<i>for someone who is insecure,</i>

13
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,672
<i>terrified, afraid</i>
<i>and disturbed themselves.</i>

14
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:39,275
It's a very real possibility you
see, because in San Francisco,

15
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:43,152
we have broken a dam of major
prejudice in this country.

16
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,249
<i>room 200.</i>
<i>I'm in the mayor's office.</i>

17
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:50,126
<i>We are trying
to ascertain what is happening.</i>

18
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,057
As President of the
Board of Supervisors,

19
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,566
it's my duty to
make this announcement.

20
00:03:56,502 --> 00:04:00,336
Both Mayor Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk

21
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,604
have been shot and killed.

22
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,707
I wish I had time to explain
all the things that I did.

23
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,719
Almost everything was done
with an eye on the gay movement.

24
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,754
Hey. Hey.

25
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,099
I'm Harvey.

26
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,763
Okay, Harvey.

27
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:33,870
Today's my birthday.

28
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,538
No, hey, actually it is
my birthday. At midnight.

29
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,669
Really?

30
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,209
And, believe it or not,
I don't have any plans.

31
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,152
Some people took
me out after work.

32
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,817
Hmm. And that would be at,
let me guess, Ma Bell or AT&T.

33
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,558
The Great American
Insurance Company.

34
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,720
Oh.

35
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,822
I'm part of that corporate
establishment that,

36
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,834
let me guess, you think is the
cause of all the evil in the world,

37
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,460
from Vietnam
to diaper rash.

38
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,095
You left out bad breath.

39
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,603
Just kidding.

40
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,806
You're not gonna let me spend my
birthday all by myself, are you?

41
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,884
Listen, Harvey,

42
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,179
you're pretty cute,

43
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,225
but I don't
date guys over 40.

44
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,359
Well, then, this
is my lucky night.

45
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,195
Why is that?

46
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,960
I'm still 39.

47
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,496
It's only 11:15.

48
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,677
Come on.

49
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,682
What's your name?

50
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,654
I'm Scott.

51
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,658
Very nice to meet you,
Mr. Harvey, insurance man.

52
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,458
Where are you from?

53
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,364
Jackson, Mississippi.

54
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,304
This isn't Jackson. You can't
respond to just every strange man

55
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,000
that picks you up
on a subway platform.

56
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,099
It's too dangerous.

57
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,507
Hmm, now you tell me.

58
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,441
The New York Police
are the toughest.

59
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,243
They're arrogant
and they're everywhere.

60
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,782
I'll show you all
the cruising spots,

61
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,784
but you have to be very
careful, little Scotty-san.

62
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,218
Are you on
some uppers or something?

63
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,620
No. This is
just plain me.

64
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,588
And you're scared
of the cops?

65
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,920
I'm just discreet.
I know a lot of people.

66
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,898
If they see me,
I could lose my job.

67
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,429
Oh, you're one of those.

68
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:22,467
Well, I think you need to find
a new scene. Some new friends.

69
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,639
I need a change.
- I know.

70
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,608
Yeah, you're 40 now.

71
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:31,672
Oh.

72
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,285
Forty years old and I haven't
done a thing I'm proud of.

73
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:43,351
You keep eating this cake and you're
going to be fat by the time you're 50.

74
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,363
That's if I ever
get to 50. Oh!

75
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,193
Happy birthday, old man.

76
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,731
Why don't we
run away together?

77
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,069
Where to?

78
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,753
<i>In the past, and still now,</i>

79
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,157
<i>San Francisco was the place</i>
<i>where everyone wanted to go.</i>

80
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:19,663
<i>To drop out,</i>
<i>to fall in love.</i>

81
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:26,669
But by 1972, the Haight was boarded up.
Drug filled, crime filled.

82
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,264
The new place
for us refugees

83
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,641
<i>was a little Irish Catholic
neighborhood in the Eureka Valley,</i>

84
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,305
<i>six blocks square,</i>

85
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,244
<i>the Castro.</i>

86
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,624
I cashed my last unemployment
check yesterday.

87
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:30,199
Well, I hope you
did something useful with it.

88
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,599
I bought
an ounce of pot.

89
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,402
Don't
move for a second.

90
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,008
I suppose
I can wait tables.

91
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,538
I don't want you to go anywhere.

92
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,050
I want you
right here with me.

93
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,248
I was thinking
about a little shop.

94
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,721
What kind of shop?

95
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,382
Just a little shop
with a little overhead.

96
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,482
Not too much work.

97
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,221
Just like Morris and Minnie
Milk of Woodmere, New York.

98
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,262
Did you see the little
place downstairs for rent?

99
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,731
Yeah.

100
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,092
What do you
think about that?

101
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,268
I think it sounds great.

102
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,568
A little bit
up on the left.

103
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,175
Oh, it looks great.
Looks great.

104
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,578
Yeah.

105
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,878
You're the
new renters?

106
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,643
Well, hello.
Harvey Milk.

107
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,153
McConnely.
- Welcome to Castro Camera.

108
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,485
Scott.

109
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,427
Yeah. Like,
you know, I would like

110
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:32,396
to join the, what's it called,
The Eureka Valley Merchants Association.

111
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,659
I'm not an interloper.

112
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,497
A Jew, perhaps, but I
hope you'll forgive that.

113
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,059
If you open
those doors,

114
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,106
the Merchants Association will
have the police pull your license.

115
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,640
Under what law?

116
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,403
Excuse me?

117
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,537
There's man's law and there's
God's law in this neighborhood

118
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:48,739
and in this city.

119
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,338
You know, we pay taxes.

120
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,783
The San Francisco police force
is happy to enforce either.

121
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:54,911
Have a good day.

122
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,150
Yeah, thank you for the
warm welcome to the neighborhood!

123
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,024
Schmuck!

124
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:03,954
Well.

125
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,691
Hey.

126
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,669
Okay.
Customers, come on in.

127
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,858
We'll form our
own business association.

128
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,125
We'll start with
the gay businesses.

129
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,101
We'll get the addresses of every customer
that comes in the store for a roll of film

130
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,537
and we'll ask them what they
want, what they need changed.

131
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,769
We'll get some money rolling in here.
Revitalize the neighborhood.

132
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,242
Can I come in now?

133
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,004
One more minute.

134
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,113
And I can go to
the neighborhood banks.

135
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,085
They must have
some gay customers.

136
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,816
Look, Harvey, what's with all
this political activist crap?

137
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,450
I mean, I thought you
were a goddamn Republican.

138
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,460
I'm a businessman, Scott.

139
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,827
And businesses should be
good to their customers.

140
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,697
Even if their
customers are gay.

141
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,759
For God's sake,
it's San Francisco!

142
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,670
Yeah. Well, it's just like
any other city in the country.

143
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,264
They hate us.
Real surprise.

144
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,174
We should have at least one
block in one city, right?

145
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,975
We start there and then we'll
take over the neighborhood.

146
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,379
Maybe.

147
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,912
I'm coming in.

148
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,180
Okay,
you can come in now.

149
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,524
Finally.
This better be good.

150
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,591
Oh!

151
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,828
Happy birthday!

152
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:51,064
I had to do it! I had to do it!
I had to do it!

153
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,264
Sanctuary, sanctuary!
- Harvey Milk!

154
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,328
Sanctuary!

155
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,104
And Castro became
destination number one.

156
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:02,644
Hundreds of gay men were coming
every week from all over the world.

157
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,943
<i>It was our area.</i>
<i>Our own neighborhood.</i>

158
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,659
<i>The police hated us.</i>
<i>And we hated them right back.</i>

159
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,028
<i>They would come in and</i>
<i>attack us and beat us just for fun.</i>

160
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,501
<i>But that wouldn't stop us.</i>

161
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,734
<i>I made a list of shops that were
friendly to us and shops that weren't.</i>

162
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,038
<i>Those shops that</i>
<i>worked with us thrived.</i>

163
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,408
<i>Those that didn't,</i>
<i>went out of business.</i>

164
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,673
<i>Closed their doors.</i>

165
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,375
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.

166
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,683
Mr. McConnely, I just came by
to see how business was doing.

167
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,087
Just fine, Harvey.

168
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,648
You don't mind having all
these homosexuals in here?

169
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,295
Kidding, everybody.
He loves our kind. Spend away.

170
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,694
Tell your wife I said hello.

171
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,667
But people started
hanging around our store.

172
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,671
Not customers.
Activists, kids,

173
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,475
young people who were looking
for a home away from home.

174
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,026
<i>There was Danny Nicoletta,</i>

175
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:30,694
<i>cute art student that I picked up at
Toad Hall, who worked in the shop.</i>

176
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,533
Harvey, come on. Opera is so passé.

177
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,005
You're not understanding
the spectacle of it,

178
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,507
the bigger
than life emotions.

179
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,475
The bigger
than life emotions?

180
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,707
Jim Rivaldo, a great mind.

181
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:50,949
Harvard graduate, which nobody cared
about in those days in the Castro.

182
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,285
Including himself.

183
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,225
<i>And somewhere along the line,
Jim picked up a protégé,</i>

184
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,092
a cute political kid from Wisconsin,
Dick Pabich.

185
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,563
And of course,
there was Dennis Peron,

186
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:04,228
<i>who ran a very successful
business with the young kids.</i>

187
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,534
And it wasn't only the gays
who noticed what was happening.

188
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,564
Also the straight people.

189
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,806
There were some
very unexpected ones.

190
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,007
Teamster leader Allan Baird
walked right into my shop

191
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:21,109
<i>and asked me if I could get my
people to help boycott Coors beer.</i>

192
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,780
<i>And the Coors beer boycott</i>
<i>had not been too successful.</i>

193
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:28,054
<i>But I got my people to get all the
Coors beer out of all the gay bars,</i>

194
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:31,619
<i>and immediately Coors fell
from number one and they caved.</i>

195
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,729
<i>A week later, the Teamsters
union, for the very first time,</i>

196
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,632
<i>hired openly gay drivers.</i>

197
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,864
<i>We weren't just a bunch
of pansies anymore.</i>

198
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,271
<i>We had had our</i>
<i>first taste of power.</i>

199
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,799
And it was about that time
that someone first called me

200
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:50,713
the Mayor of Castro Street, or I
may have invented the term myself.

201
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,447
The fucking cops, man.

202
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:57,955
Cops are pulling
people out of Toad Hall.

203
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:58,955
Why?
What did they do?

204
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,753
They're sweeping the streets.
It's happening right now.

205
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,191
Come on.
- Come on.

206
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,047
Through the door there,
the front door there,

207
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:34,786
was just an explosion
of police charging in here.

208
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,057
I ran into the bathroom to
hide with some other people.

209
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:44,301
All we could hear was screaming
and crunching and smashing.

210
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,273
It was frankly the most terrifying
experience I've had in my life.

211
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,740
If we had
someone in government

212
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,752
who saw things the
way that we see them,

213
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,382
like the black community has black
leaders that look out for their interests.

214
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,259
Politics is theater.

215
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,529
It doesn't matter
so much about winning.

216
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,627
You make a statement.

217
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,333
You say, "I'm here."
You get their attention.

218
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,667
I mean, it'll be fun.

219
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:35,712
Even though the Castro was firmly our
area by 1973, it wasn't safe for us.

220
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:39,724
We would have to wear whistles
on our necks or in our pockets.

221
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,488
<i>And if you ever heard a whistle,</i>
<i>you would run to help.</i>

222
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,993
Fruit was walking home
with his trick when he got jumped.

223
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,626
Name's Robert Hillsborough.
Did you know him?

224
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,331
He used to come into my shop.
Are there any witnesses?

225
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,703
Yeah, just
the trick, Jerry Taylor.

226
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,299
Jerry's not his trick, he's his lover.

227
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,742
Hey,
call it what you will.

228
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:03,270
All we know is he's our only witness and
he said he can't identify the attackers.

229
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,714
Oh, you'd have a dozen witnesses
if they thought you boys had any

230
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,809
real interest
in protecting them.

231
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,763
<i>Hey, come on. Come
over. Everyone gather around.</i>

232
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,602
Hey, Milk,
good job on Coors.

233
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,939
Thank you and we were very happy to
do that. We were very happy to do that.

234
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,035
<i>Everyone over here,</i>
<i>gather around.</i>

235
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,281
<i>Hello. I'm Harvey Milk.</i>

236
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,147
<i>A week ago,</i>

237
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:52,824
<i>police officers came into
our area with badges covered.</i>

238
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:59,394
<i>They sent 14 of our people</i>
<i>to hospitals and to jail.</i>

239
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,032
<i>The charges,</i>
<i>"Blocking the sidewalk."</i>

240
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,840
<i>Let's let our tax money go to our
protection, not our persecution.</i>

241
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:14,040
<i>Worry about gun control,
not marijuana control.</i>

242
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,816
<i>School supplies, seniors,</i>
<i>not the books we read!</i>

243
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,959
<i>My fellow degenerates,</i>

244
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:31,803
<i>I would like to announce my candidacy
for San Francisco City Supervisor!</i>

245
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,368
How are you, Lee?
- Fine, thank you.

246
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,434
Oh, I bought you some flowers
to brighten up your day.

247
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,980
Could I leave some
flyers for your customers?

248
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:44,942
Hello, everyone.

249
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,541
Harvey Milk,
running for supervisor.

250
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,108
<i>We need your support.</i>

251
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,155
Are you registered
to vote?

252
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,452
Let me just give you that.
It's for Harvey Milk for supervisor, all right?

253
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,992
<i>He's running for the Board of Supervisors.</i>
<i>Right. Thank you.</i>

254
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,220
<i>Take care.</i>
<i>Have a good day.</i>

255
00:19:56,295 --> 00:20:00,994
Harvey Milk for supervisor! Excuse
me, ma'am, are you registered to vote?

256
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,658
Sir, are you
registered to vote?

257
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,202
I'm Harvey Milk, sir.
I'm running for supervisor.

258
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,795
I want you to know that my
campaign is very interested

259
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,568
in taking care of
seniors in the area.

260
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,165
<i>We've been doing</i>
<i>a lot about reaching out.</i>

261
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,906
I'm Harvey Milk. Will you register
here if you're not registered?

262
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:20,213
Hey, I like the way those pants
fit! Where are you from, kid?

263
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,549
Sorry, old man,
not interested.

264
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,680
Where's home?

265
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,314
Phoenix.

266
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,985
Come here.
Just come here a minute.

267
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,663
I'm Harvey Milk.
I'm running for supervisor.

268
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,859
What's your name?

269
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,799
Cleve Jones.

270
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,099
Cleve Jones.
You're adorable.

271
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:44,131
We should get you over here and
get you registered, Mr. Jones.

272
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,105
Fuck that.
Elections of any kind

273
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,272
are fucking
bourgeois affectation.

274
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,009
Is that right?
- Mmm-hmm.

275
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,381
What do you do,
trick up on Polk Street?

276
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,513
If I need the cash.

277
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,058
But I'm a little bit more selective
about my clients than you are.

278
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,890
Okay, let me ask you one thing
before you go back to work.

279
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,055
What was it like to be
a little queer in Phoenix?

280
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,622
Did all the jocks beat
you up in gym class?

281
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,101
I faked a lung disease
to get out of P.E.

282
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,801
So what, what are you?
Some kind of street shrink?

283
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,309
Sometimes.

284
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,506
But what I'm talking about
is that we can change Phoenix.

285
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:25,176
But we have to
start with our street.

286
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:31,949
Police abuse, rent control,
pot, parks, seniors issues.

287
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,924
Good luck
with all that.

288
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,585
Good luck.

289
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,261
You know what I think,
Cleve Jones?

290
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,162
That you're gonna get
somewhere if you keep talking.

291
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,463
No. I think you should
do what you do well.

292
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,059
You should
be a prick.

293
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:49,233
But come with us and be a prick.
Fight City Hall. Fight the cops.

294
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,833
Fight the people that made you
come here to do what you do.

295
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,777
Sorry, old man, I'm leaving
for Spain tomorrow. Europe.

296
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:57,246
All the cash I need
is in my back pocket.

297
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,419
I'm just saying that at this
point, it looks like all the big guns,

298
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,052
all the gay money,
the real money,

299
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,494
is gonna get
behind Feinstein

300
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,088
and all the straight candidates
they consider "gay-friendly."

301
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,997
Who cares about
those old queens?

302
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,194
Well, you need
them to get elected.

303
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,067
Why isn't my campaign
manager leading this meeting?

304
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,766
'Cause I'm exhausted. I've been
handing out pamphlets for seven hours.

305
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,103
Yeah, in a bathhouse.

306
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,076
And who are these so-called
gay leaders anyway?

307
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:28,669
Who appointed them?
What are you suggesting, Jim?

308
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,942
That I go down there and
solicit their endorsement?

309
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,144
I mean, we're down here trying to help
people on the streets. Where are they?

310
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,414
Yeah, I know, but...
You need an endorsement, Harvey.

311
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,750
Take this.

312
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,120
Checking the exposure.

313
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,159
They're nice pictures.

314
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,126
Is he your boyfriend?
- Sort of.

315
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,962
Harvey, David Goodstein is a
publisher from <i>The Advocate.</i>

316
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,430
Harvey.
- He's got a house...

317
00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:51,697
Harvey, I think
you got to see this.

318
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,008
"Harvey Milk will
have a dream journey

319
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:01,136
"and nightmare to hell,
a night of horror.

320
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:06,310
"You will be stabbed and have your
genitals, cock, balls and prick cut off."

321
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,748
I'm calling the police.

322
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,483
They probably wrote it.
Look, think of it this way.

323
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,491
If they try to kill me,
I'll get the sympathy vote.

324
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,891
That might be
just the push we need.

325
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,658
You think this is funny?
Look at it.

326
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,629
It's a total joke.

327
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:26,796
I mean, it's got no rhythm,
no humor. It's insulting.

328
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,566
Don't do that.

329
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:33,270
No, if you put it away,
you put it in a drawer,

330
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,313
it just gets
bigger and scarier.

331
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:38,281
Here, it's right here. We see
it every day. It can't get us.

332
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:43,053
Gonna spend all this energy
to make yourself a target?

333
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,918
For something you're
not gonna even win?

334
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,084
I keep telling you,
it's not just about winning.

335
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:52,386
<i>The top gays in</i>
<i>San Francisco were David Goodstein</i>

336
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:55,024
<i>and his civil rights
lawyer sidekick, Rick Stokes.</i>

337
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,263

the biggest gay magazine,</i> The Advocate.

338
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:01,032
Hello.
- Hello, welcome to Mr. Goodstein's.

339
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,198
Milo.

340
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,342
I worked for a financial
institution in New York.

341
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:07,935
I was very discreet.

342
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,072
One night I went to
the Metropolitan Opera,

343
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,116
<i>Il Trovatore,</i> Verdi.

344
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,550
I was sitting in a
box, next to my lover.

345
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:18,117
Someone spotted us.
Next day I was fired.

346
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,289
So I decided to do
something about it.

347
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,226
Came out here to San Francisco,
I bought <i>The Advocate.</i>

348
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:29,532
I use my money and my influence, in very
subtle and quiet ways, to do what I can.

349
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,098
So you think that backing
straight candidates

350
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,364
is the best
way to help us?

351
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,406
Yeah, if they're
friendly to our cause.

352
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,408
Supervisor is
a citywide office.

353
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,205
Political alliances
have to be built.

354
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:43,407
You can't just move here from across
the country and run for that office.

355
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,949
But I am running for office.

356
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,313
I'm on the ballot.

357
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,511
I have the union rank and
file, I have the seniors.

358
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,385
And I would like to have
your magazine's endorsement.

359
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,826
Harvey, we're like
the Catholic church.

360
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:59,421
We welcome converts, but we
don't make them Pope the same day.

361
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,591
Why haven't you run yet?

362
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,635
Too early.
Especially from the Castro.

363
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,537
What's wrong
with the Castro?

364
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,541
Nobody works there.
It's all about sex and drugs and more sex.

365
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,907
David, we need one
of our own in office.

366
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:18,882
Harvey, you can't demand
acceptance overnight.

367
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,076
Why not?

368
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,847
The more "out" you make us,
the more you incite them.

369
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,822
Harvey, step back and quiet down.

370
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,052
You're suggesting we should
go back in the closet?

371
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,525
Is that what
you're saying?

372
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,563
I spent more years in the
closet than I care to remember.

373
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,258
Let's go, Scott.
- Yeah.

374
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:35,765
I don't need your
magazine's endorsement.

375
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,928
And I'm not asking for anyone's
acceptance. I don't have time.

376
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:42,530
For you,
politics is a game, a lark.

377
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,440
It's like putting on a rock
festival or staging a love-in.

378
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,603
You're too old to be
a hippie, Harvey Milk.

379
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,614
I am not a candidate.
I am part of a movement.

380
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,708
The movement is the candidate.
There is a difference.

381
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,719
You don't see it,
but I do.

382
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,949
Sorry, I, uh,
pissed in the pool.

383
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:06,723
So, on election day, out of 32
candidates vying for six seats,

384
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,097
<i>we came in tenth.</i>
<i>We lost.</i>

385
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:16,971
But only a few votes shy of my becoming
the first big eared, cock-sucking,

386
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,977
queer as a
three-dollar-bill-man

387
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,071
<i>to be elected</i>
<i>to public office.</i>

388
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:27,343
So we decided to
try it again in 1975.

389
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,213
<i>Only this time,</i>
<i>with a few adjustments.</i>

390
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:37,318
No. No, not cute.
I hate the shoes.

391
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,226
I hate the hair.
You're not fooling anybody.

392
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,561
I'm not gonna let those
little Pacific Heights biddies

393
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:44,431
write me off anymore because
of a ponytail. I like it.

394
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:49,064
No more bathhouses, no more
pot, for me and my little poo.

395
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,373
Speak for yourself.
- Come on.

396
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:59,612
We ran and lost the supervisor's
race for the second time in 1975,

397
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,676
but with more votes
than ever before.

398
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:08,621
So in 1976,
against everyone's advice,

399
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:11,890
<i>I really pissed off</i>
<i>the political power houses</i>

400
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:15,023
<i>in the Democratic party by
running against their man,</i>

401
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,695
<i>Art Agnos, who was part</i>
<i>of their political machine.</i>

402
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,830
<i>And this time, not for
supervisor, but for a bigger job,</i>

403
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,703
<i>for the California</i>
<i>State Assembly.</i>

404
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:27,040
I don't think that State Assembly
seats should be the reward

405
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,977
for service to the
Democratic party machine.

406
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,641
Machines run on oil and grease.
They're dirty.

407
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:36,176
They're dehumanizing. And they
tend to be entirely unresponsive

408
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:39,280
to the needs of anybody,
but those of their operator.

409
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:43,353
Mr. Milk, I've been a social
worker in this city for years.

410
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,225
I know Sacramento.

411
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,764
I know how to get done
what we all need done there.

412
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:51,529
Tell me something, Mr. Agnos,
right here in the Castro,

413
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:56,370
Robert Hillsbourough was murdered for
walking home with his longtime partner.

414
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,306
He was stabbed 15 times.

415
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:03,845
The last words he heard were,
"Faggot, faggot, faggot."

416
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:07,612
Now, you say
you're outraged.

417
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:14,185
Why then does your liberal
establishment refuse to answer our calls?

418
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,989
Why do they not bring
these murderers to justice?

419
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,664
My God, you're
handsome up close.

420
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,669
Can't tell you how much I'm
looking forward to licking you,

421
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,000
in the polls.

422
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,972
You know, Harv, your
whole rap's a real downer.

423
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,275
You talk a lot about
what you're against.

424
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,938
But what are you for?

425
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:41,384
In this town, you got to give them a
reason for optimism, or you're cooked.

426
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,322
See you around.

427
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,324
Okay, Art.

428
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:50,824
You're gonna wanna
read that entire thing.

429
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,226
Okay,
I'll take a look at it.

430
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:53,662
Excuse me.

431
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,700
Guys.
- Don't touch that.

432
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:59,394
Harvey. Harvey, dinner.
- have to get some union boys in there.

433
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,905
They love me, they love me.

434
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,575
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

435
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,240
Harvey, you have to eat.

436
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:14,376
Everyone, the apartment
is now off limits!

437
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,283
Good night.
Good night.

438
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,456
Good night.
Whose jacket is this?

439
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,355
Right here.
- Here you go. Good night.

440
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,224
Down the stairs.
Thank you. Thank you.

441
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,396
Good night. Thank you.

442
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:29,160
I think you got to call the
guy, 'cause I can't talk to that guy.

443
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,792
Sit.

444
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,503
Don't say anything.

445
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,048
Can I just tell you...

446
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,281
If you say anything about
politics or the campaign,

447
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:52,550
or what speech you
have to give or anything,

448
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,184
I swear to God I'm gonna
stab you with this fork.

449
00:29:56,261 --> 00:30:02,257
I just wanted to say that this is the
most wonderful dinner I have ever had.

450
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,974
If we lose this, it'll
just be you and me again.

451
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,907
I promise.

452
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,706
I'm sorry, I just...

453
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,909
No, I know.
I know, I know.

454
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,708
Phoenix.

455
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,213
At least now
you look gay.

456
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,218
Let's go inside.

457
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:48,430
Are you
staying up with me?

458
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,670
The election's tomorrow.
I won't sleep anyway.

459
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,582
Was he handsome?

460
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,852
Oh, no!
He was hideous.

461
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,629
Usually when my lovers leave, they
cheat with even more attractive men.

462
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:23,532
I actually thought we were gonna
spend the rest of our lives together.

463
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,882
Well, guess what,
Cleve Jones.

464
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,410
What?

465
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:38,615
You're going to meet the
most extraordinary men,

466
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,955
the sexiest, funniest,
brightest men.

467
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,551
You're going to meet so many of them,
fall in love with so many of them,

468
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,187
you won't know till
the end of your life

469
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:49,791
which ones were your greatest lovers
and which were your greatest friends.

470
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,799
Is that supposed to help?

471
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:56,202
Maybe a little. Or not.

472
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,983
I went to
Spain last month.

473
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,384
Long story.

474
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:17,326
In Barcelona, there
was this memorial march

475
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:19,989
for gay people that
had died under Franco.

476
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:23,798
Of course, the police
tried to break it up.

477
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:25,927
But these queens didn't run.
No.

478
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,440
They turned around and
they started a fucking riot.

479
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,340
I saw a bullet, one of
those big rubber bullets

480
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:36,506
rip through a drag queen's
scalp, but she kept on fighting.

481
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:40,107
She was screaming,
but she kept on fighting.

482
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,308
I mean...

483
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:45,854
Our lives.

484
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,726
There was blood literally
running in the gutter.

485
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:55,293
In a gutter.

486
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,833
We could have
a revolution here.

487
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:07,500
But you can't use the
Castro just to cruise.

488
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,004
You have to fight.

489
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,843
You really think you'll win?

490
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,013
Winning is
not my strong suit.

491
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,488
Well,

492
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,491
I don't do losing, ever.

493
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,861
Maybe I should run for office
and you can work for me.

494
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,093
I mean, if you can do it...

495
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,329
Can you assemble a
thousand people in an hour?

496
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,529
Fuck, yeah.

497
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:36,129
Well, if I run again,
you're gonna be my man.

498
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,468
If?

499
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:41,105
You're so adorable.

500
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,249
The polls are open in 3 hours.

501
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,448
How about you and
I hit the bus stops?

502
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:51,310
Okay.

503
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:58,027
<i> Yes, Jesus</i>

504
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,196

<i>that you're denying homosexuals</i>
<i>many of their rights as well.</i>

521
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:53,540
<i>You see, if homosexuals are
allowed their civil rights,</i>

522
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:56,485

follow that you believe that</i>

525
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,786

526
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,328

This is incredible.

down Market Street,

right around the
Haight like this,

537
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:54,469

the Castro.

The Haight and the Castro.
That's it.

539

541

You win by a landslide.

Hope for a better place to come into

Hope for the worker who

only to find that all the
jobs have left the country.

649

We've got to
give them hope.

650
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:59,018
When San Francisco
changed its voting rules,

651
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:02,065
so that people could elect people
from their own neighborhood,

652
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:06,228
so that the blacks could elect
a African-American supervisor,

653
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:09,329
and in Chinatown, they could
elect a Chinese supervisor,

654
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:13,467
and in the Castro, they could choose
between myself and Rick Stokes.

655
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,944
<i>But decent art</i>
<i>begs balance, right?</i>

<i>So, little district eight,</i>

<i>Irish Catholic, conservative.</i>

660
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,753

by splinter groups of social radicals,
social deviants, and incorrigibles.

662
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:40,936
Now you must realize that there are
thousands upon thousands of frustrated,

663
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,666
angry people,
such as yourselves,

664

a fury that will eradicate

blight our beautiful city.

666
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:56,719
Just one more. We can't let
Rick Stokes take this one.

667
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:58,618
Let Rick Stokes

668
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,427
Sorry.

669
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,301
I can't do another one.

670
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,311
Oh, God damn it.

671
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:24,240

673
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:29,578
I don't want to see one more thing
that says fucking Assembly on it.

674
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:34,709
'Cause this three time faggot
loser is running for supervisor.

675
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:36,844
There she is.
- Who the heck is that?

676
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,945
That's our
new campaign manager.

677
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,082
She called last week to volunteer
and I asked for her help.

678
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,889
Help or take over?
What about Scott?

679
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,452
We need new blood.

680
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:50,330
Gentlemen, Anne Kronenberg.
A woman.

681
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,927
A woman who likes women.
And that's odd, isn't it?

682
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:55,562
Hi, guys.

683
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:59,302
Mr. Milk, Rick Stokes
isn't pulling out.

684
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,810
He's officially filed
to run against you.

685
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:05,178
My friend at <i>The Advocate</i>
says David Goodstein is backing him.

686
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:07,479
So, a gay candidate
against a gay candidate.

687
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,984
That's unfortunate.

688
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,314
Let's find out when they
are going to announce.

689
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,218
So you replaced
Scott with a lesbian?

690
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,587
Anne worked on a recycling
campaign up north.

691
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:17,252
She's very, very organized.
We need that.

692
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,352
How do you know she's
not a plant for Rick Stokes?

693
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,659
Are you guys
always this paranoid?

694
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,326
Yes. We take after Harvey.

695
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,335
Don't you have someone's
laundry to do?

696
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,268
Shouldn't you be at
a hairdressing convention?

697
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:32,174
Sir, my girlfriends say
you guys don't like women.

698
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,504
I'm just asking.

699
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:37,308
Is there a place for us in all
this or are you all scared of girls?

700
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:41,808
Okay, gentlemen,

701
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:44,217
we've already got a tinker
bell, a lotus blossom.

702
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:45,915
We've got Jim and Dick
in their three-piece suits.

703
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:50,187
We need someone to manage things.
A woman this time.

704
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,089
Plus,
she's the right price,

705
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:55,631
and she's got bigger balls
than anybody else in here.

706
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,031
Just give me whatever is in the
register at the end of the day.

707
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:03,835
So should I call <i>The Chronicle</i> about
getting us an actual endorsement this time?

708
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:05,033
No?

709
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:08,009
Yeah, call <i>The Chronicle,</i>
sweetheart. Tell them I said hi.

710
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,911
Please call. In fact,
don't drive down there.

711
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:12,778
You'll scare
the shit out of them.

712
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,075
Call.

713
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:17,245
All right.

714
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,720
Hi, I'm Cleve.

715
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,484
Anne. Good to meet you.

716
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:23,321
I was telling Harvey we needed
some tough dykes around here, so...

717
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:24,792
Well, you got one.

718
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:15,903
All right.

719
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:18,971
First ever newspaper
endorsement.

720
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:21,745
And we got
the <i>Bay Guardian,</i>

721
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:24,548
<i>The Sentinel</i> and
<i>The Bay Area Reporter.</i>

722
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:32,394
You are pulling your weight.
Oh, this is sensational!

723
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:36,459
They endorsed you for
being a good businessman?

724
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,434
Oh, my gosh, you really
are a miracle worker.

725
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:41,835
Scott has got to read this.
He's just gonna piss himself.

726
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:43,634
Yeah,
you should show him.

727
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:45,836
You know what you should do, Cleve,

728
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:49,208
you should get yourself a boy to
celebrate with, just in case we win.

729
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:50,678
Anybody want to
buy me a drink?

730
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,578
Oh, I will buy you
a drink.

731
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:54,116
How about a bottle
of champagne?

732
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:58,650
We are going to The Stud
right fucking now.

733
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,690
Harvey, are you going to come?
You're gonna miss out?

734
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:03,487
Go, go, go, go.
I want to be with my newspaper.

735
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:07,990
Come on, let's go.
Come on, I'm buying.

736
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,590
You're not buying.
You don't have any money.

737
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,871
Gonna win this time, Milk?

738
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,381
You look more
handsome in the poster.

739
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:04,813
Oh, thank you.

740
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:11,322
You know, palominos
are my favorite horse.

741
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,523
They're smart.

742
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,463
But they're
compact and fast.

743
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:18,467
I like that.

744
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:25,807
You think I'm more
like a palomino,

745
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,537
or a stallion?

746
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,804
You know,
with big balls and...

747
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:36,046
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Here, let me help you.

748
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,217
You okay?

749
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,315
Yeah, it's...
- Come in.

750
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:45,156
Here, just lean on me.

751
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:46,661
Thank you.
- What happened?

752
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,994
I don't know, these
boots are too big for me.

753
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:53,058
Oh, well, let's get you
in and get those off your feet.

754
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:55,434
Where you going?

755
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,598
I have some things to do.

756
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,302
I got to go and meet
some friends. No, no, no.

757
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:13,589
My father beat
me when he found out.

758
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,290
So, that's
why I came here.

759
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:23,863
But, I'm living with this
guy that... I don't know.

760
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,399
I don't like him.

761
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,567
Nobody will
ever beat you again.

762
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:39,677
I love you.
I love you.

763
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:42,919
Do you even
remember my name?

764
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:49,751
No.

765
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:51,020
Harvey.

766
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,657
I'm Harvey.

767
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,729
Harvey, I love you.

768
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:10,037
Thanks.

769
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:11,205
Thank you.

770
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,922
<i>For the first time,
it all came together.</i>

771
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:30,831
<i>The union boys, women, the
seniors, the gays and minorities.</i>

772
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,198
<i>All of the "us's"</i>
<i>showed up.</i>

773
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,204
<i>We can hear it,</i>
<i>we can't really see too much,</i>

774
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,706
<i>but it looks and sounds</i>
<i>to you and to me</i>

775
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,106
<i>like New Year's Eve</i>
<i>on Market Street.</i>

776
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,677
We did it!

777
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,684
I love you all!

778
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:08,801
We are the movement. We are
the movement. Thank you so much.

779
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:10,805
Come on, we just want
to congratulate him.

780
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:13,434
No, I understand, but
right now we're all full.

781
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,047
Harvey!

782
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:20,241
Harvey!
- Harvey!

783
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,547
Hey, Harvey!

784
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:25,179
Hey.

785
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:28,656
Sorry, it's just so crowded.

786
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,989
Come in, sorry, sorry.

787
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:33,757
It's so crowded.
It's just so crowded.

788
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:36,189
Harvey, man!

789
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:42,563
Scotty!

790
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:47,005
Is this all for you, Harvey?
Are you this famous, baby?

791
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:49,045
No, we do this all the time.
You like it?

792
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:50,170
Yeah.

793
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:54,012
The new Mrs. Milk.
I give it a week.

794
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:58,316
Gordon Lau, Carol Ruth Silver. It's the
most liberal board in years. In history!

795
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:00,819
What about Dan White?
Did he win?

796
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:03,188
We'll deal with him tomorrow.
- Oh, God.

797
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:18,270
<i>Does this mean, as many
straights are concerned,</i>

798
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:21,174
<i>maybe the gays are taking</i>
<i>over San Francisco?</i>

799
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:24,441
<i>Are you going to be a
supervisor for all the people?</i>

800
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:26,914
<i>Well, I have to be. That's
what I was elected for.</i>

801
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:29,577
<i>I have to be there to</i>
<i>open for the dialogue,</i>

802
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:32,621
<i>for the sensitivities of all
people and all their problems.</i>

803
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:35,522
<i>The problems that affect
this city, affect us all.</i>

804
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,649
<i>Okay, well,</i>
<i>congratulations.</i>

805
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,218
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you, San Francisco!</i>

806
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:43,496
<i>And that's Harvey Milk,</i>

807
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,501
<i>celebrating his election to the
San Francisco Board of Supervisors.</i>

808
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,867
<i>For Channel Five news,</i>
<i>I'm Mary Dilts.</i>

809
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:53,673
<i>I, Harvey Milk, do solemnly swear...</i>

810
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,608
<i>I, Harvey Milk, do solemnly swear...</i>

811
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:59,307
<i>That I will support and defend the
Constitution of the United States...</i>

812
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:02,476
<i>hat I will support and defend the
Constitution of the United States...</i>

813
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:06,249
<i>During such time as I
<i>hold the office of supervisor,</i>

814
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:09,189
<i>City and County</i>
<i>of San Francisco.</i>

815
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,922
During such time as I hold
the office of supervisor,

816
00:57:12,996 --> 00:57:15,590
City and County
of San Francisco.

817
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,826
Congratulations, Harvey.
- Thank you, Mayor.

818
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:25,872
<i>Anita Bryant said that it was gay people
that brought the drought to California.</i>

819
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:30,535
<i>Well, it looks to me as though
it's finally started raining.</i>

820
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:33,442
<i>This will be</i>
<i>the first time in many years</i>

821
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:36,485
<i>that we've seen so many new faces
on the Board of Supervisors.</i>

822
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:39,545
Do you think such diversity
will cripple the board?

823
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:42,921
Well, the name of the game is
six votes to get anything passed.

824
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,482
So, whether you like it or not,

825
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,722
Dan and I are
in bed together.

826
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,286
Politically speaking.

827
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:50,859
<i>You see, I've assured
Harvey here that, uh,</i>

828
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:53,459
<i>my brochure's comments</i>
<i>about social deviants</i>

829
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:56,471
<i>referred more to junkies</i>
<i>than to his people.</i>

830
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:58,666
<i>See, I'm about to</i>
<i>have my first child</i>

831
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:02,507
<i>and I had to make sure that this city
remains a decent place to raise him.</i>

832
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:06,444
<i>Well, thank you so much
for coming on the show, gentlemen,</i>

833
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,143
<i>and we'll see what happens.</i>

834
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,446
<i>That's it?</i>
<i>It's over? We're finished?</i>

835
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,577
<i>Yes.</i>

836
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,587
<i>That was quick.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

837
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,851
How long were
you a fireman, Dan?

838
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,323
A couple of years.

839
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:18,417
And you were a police
officer before that?

840
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,258
You got something
against cops, Harv?

841
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,560
No, no. They tend
to against me though.

842
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:25,066
But firefighters,
they're the true heroes.

843
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:27,898
They supported me on my last
campaign. I fully support them.

844
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,632
I appreciate that.

845
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:31,674
I meant what I said.
I'd like to work together.

846
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,368
Me, too.
I'll see you later.

847
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:34,432
Okay.

848
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:51,051
Oh. What do you think
of my new theater?

849
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:52,594
A bit over the top.

850
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:56,594
You're wearing a suit?

851
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:57,997
I got it
from a friend.

852
00:58:58,067 --> 00:58:59,261
No, no, no, no.

853
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:02,964
Anytime you come here, I want you
to wear the tightest jeans possible.

854
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,065
Never blend in. And
never take the elevator.

855
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:07,404
Always use
the stairs.

856
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:12,471
You can make such a grand
entrance by taking these stairs.

857
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:14,043
Hello.

858
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:16,108
Carol, friend.

859
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,987
Dan White.

860
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,318
Hello, Dianne.

861
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,624
And then this is
Gordon Lau's office.

862
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:28,254
Anne, can you set Cleve up on mail?

863
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:29,491
Will do.

864
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,566
Okay,

865
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:34,830
first order of business
to come out of this office

866
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:36,599
is a citywide
Gay Rights Ordinance,

867
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:39,403
just like the one that Anita
shot down in Dade County.

868
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:40,635
What do you think,
Lotus Blossom?

869
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,837
I think it's good.
It's not great.

870
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:46,905
Okay, so make it brilliant. We want
Anita's attention here in San Francisco.

871
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:49,076
I want her to bring
her fight to us.

872
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:52,178
We need a unanimous
vote, we need headlines.

873
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,882
Dan White is not
gonna vote for this.

874
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,185
Dan White will be fine.

875
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,522
Dan White is just
uneducated. We'll teach him.

876
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,154
Hey, Harv,
committee meets at 9:30.

877
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:01,689
Hey, you guys.

878
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,528
Say, did you get the invitation
to my son's christening?

879
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,398
I invited a few of
the other Supes, too.

880
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,232
Oh, I'll be there.

881
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:10,101
Great! Thanks.

882
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,008
Did he hear you?
- What the fuck!

883
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:14,941
Are you going?

884
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:18,208
I would let him christen me if it means
he's gonna vote for the Gay Rights Ordinance.

885
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,909
We need allies.
We need everyone.

886
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,108
I don't think
he heard you.

887
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:24,915
Is it just me
or is he cute?

888
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:48,670
Jack?

889
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:53,014
Welcome home, Harvey.
I hope you're hungry.

890
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:56,475
I just know how to cook one
thing, but I make it good.

891
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,085
Come.

892
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:00,986
Jack,
did you break in?

893
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:04,493
No, no, no. I asked the little
boy downstairs to let me in.

894
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,754
Danny?
- Yeah.

895
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,558
He wouldn't let me,
so I came in this way.

896
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,426
You know, your friends aren't
very nice to me, Harvey.

897
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,163
I have a Town Hall
meeting tonight.

898
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:18,173
Sit down. Come, five minutes.
That's it. Come, please.

899
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:21,236
There you go.

900
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:25,044
I watched TV here
today, all day.

901
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:26,945
I saw <i>All My Children.</i>

902
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,681
And they killed Margo.
But I knew it was going to happen.

903
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:36,553
You know, they always try and
trick you but it never works.

904
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:39,524
You always
see it coming.

905
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:44,726
What? Killing the blonde?
Yeah, I'm good with that.

906
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:51,163
Jack.
- What?

907
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,170
If I make you a key,

908
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:56,674
will you promise never
to break in again?

909
01:01:58,347 --> 01:01:59,814
That's right.

910
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,787
Is it your will that Charles should
be baptized in the faith of the church

911
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:16,729
which we have all
professed with you?

912
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,323
It is.
- It is.

913
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:25,436
Charles, I baptize you
in the name of the Father

914
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:28,875
and of the Son and
of the Holy Spirit.

915
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:38,648
God, the father of our Lord Jesus
Christ has freed you from sin...

916
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:40,985
I'm proposing
a citywide ordinance

917
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:43,855
which would ensure that any
person who already has a job

918
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,759
cannot be fired on the
basis of sexual orientation.

919
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:50,722
I don't think my constituents
would favor that, Harvey.

920
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:56,199
Is there anyone else here
from the board today, Dan?

921
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,370
You're the only one
who showed, I think.

922
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,568
Were you
christened here?

923
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,168
I was. Right here, same parish.

924
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:06,272
My grandma immigrated here when
this was an Irish Catholic city,

925
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:08,044
the City of Saint Francis.

926
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:10,410
But a lot's changed here
since then, you know.

927
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:13,011
You're more like one
of us now, an outsider.

928
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,490
You're not like most
homosexuals, are you, Harvey?

929
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:19,861
Do you know a lot
of homosexuals, Dan?

930
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:26,524
Hey, where do you stand
on the Psychiatric Center

931
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:28,934
that the city's been
pushing into my district?

932
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:31,564
Well, I'd have
to study it...

933
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:36,010
It was a key piece on my platform.
Getting it out of my district.

934
01:03:36,078 --> 01:03:38,342
It only attracts arsonists, rapists,
that sort of thing, you know.

935
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:39,711
A campaign promise.

936
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,511
A big one.
- Sure.

937
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:47,647
What do you say we watch out for each
other's interests? I would really like that.

938
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:49,850
I'd like that too, Dan.
- Good.

939
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,825
Sorry, hon, we just
slipped into some shop talk.

940
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:55,022
The Gay Rights Ordinance.
My fault.

941
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:57,695
Seems like an inappropriate
subject, don't you think?

942
01:03:57,767 --> 01:04:00,167
Oh, don't knock it
till you've tried it.

943
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:05,700
Hello. Oh, oh, but you had
such a beautiful christening.

944
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:07,834
Supervisors Silver and
Lau are asking you to vote

945
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,901
to keep this Psychiatric
Center in Dan's district.

946
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:12,812
It'll go down six to five
if you vote to get rid of it.

947
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:14,315
It's a youth campus, Harvey.

948
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:16,613
And these are kids that would
be displaced from families.

949
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,847
I can't just dump Dan.
He's got nothing going for him.

950
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:20,047
No friends...

951
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:23,523
Oh, God, oh, God! Here we go, here we go.
Harvey to the rescue.

952
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:25,891
Isn't it enough that we
have to put up with Jack?

953
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:28,897
All right, lay off. He
registered 120 voters last week.

954
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:30,398
Okay, so do any
of your volunteers,

955
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:32,661
but you don't go and
make them all first lady.

956
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:35,431
Harvey, what does
Dan White do for you?

957
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:37,529
Really, politically.

958
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:41,305
He intrigues me.
I think he may be one of us.

959
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,537
No, no.

960
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,273
It's just a theory.

961
01:04:44,347 --> 01:04:45,814
You just think he's cute.

962
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:49,113
No, no. I know what it's
like to live that life.

963
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:52,916
That lie. I can see it in Dan's eyes.
That fear, the pressure.

964
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:01,496
Good or bad?
- Not great.

965
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:06,365
State Senator John Briggs is Anita Bryant's
go-to guy in California for sure.

966
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,929
He filed a petition for
a statewide referendum

967
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:13,032
to fire all gay teachers
and anyone who supports them.

968
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:15,902
How many signatures does
he need to get on the ballot?

969
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:20,472
Oh, whatever. He can get them in two
Sundays at church in Orange fucking County.

970
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:26,910
So, this means that
the fight is coming here,

971
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,522
where we can do
something about it.

972
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:33,388
<i>The issue in California
is whether school boards</i>

973
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:36,761
<i>should be allowed to fire teachers
who are known homosexuals.</i>

974
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:38,766
<i>The courts have</i>
<i>ruled they cannot.</i>

975
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:42,827
<i>Boards must prove a teacher's
homosexuality adversely affects children</i>

976
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,203
<i>and makes them unfit</i>
<i>for the classroom.</i>

977
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:47,765
<i>State Senator John Briggs</i>
<i>wants to change that.</i>

978
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:53,338
My proposition promises to protect our
children from these gay perverts and...

979
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:58,817
These gay perverts and pedophiles
who recruit our children

980
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:02,187
to participate in their
deviant lifestyle,

981
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:05,284
including the ones who do
it in our public schools.

982
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:09,525
The time has come
for us to root them out.

983
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:12,963
How are you going to
determine who's homosexual?

984
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:14,332
I'm sorry, sir, what?

985
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,564
How are you going to
determine who's homosexual?

986
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,665
Sir, my bill has procedures
for identifying homosexuals.

987
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:22,540
Oh, yeah, how?
Will you be sucking them off, Briggs?

988
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:25,910
Excuse me. You know what,
you can argue with me,

989
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:28,673
you cannot
argue with God.

990
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,215
Harvey, I can't believe it.

991
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:39,591
No, he wants my job.
You want my job, you prick!

992
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:42,790
<i>Sir, you were here when
State Senator Briggs was on the steps.</i>

993
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:44,264
<i>What do you</i>
<i>think about that?</i>

994
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:48,429
<i>Well, I think what you saw, you saw some
very committed opposition to his proposition.</i>

995
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:50,734
<i>And I think that's</i>
<i>only going to continue.</i>

996
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:53,434
<i>People have very
emotional reactions to this.</i>

997
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,067
<i>This is their lives</i>
<i>that are on the line.</i>

998
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:57,203
<i>What's going to happen?</i>

999
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:59,975
<i>Well, look what</i>
<i>happened in Germany.</i>

1000
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:03,678
<i>I mean, Anita Bryant has already said that
the Jews and Muslims are going to hell.</i>

1001
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:06,187
<i>So, you know she</i>
<i>has a shopping list.</i>

1002
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:09,281
<i>And we are not going to let</i>
<i>the John Briggs' or the Anita Bryants</i>

1003
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,326
<i>legislate bigotry</i>
<i>in this state.</i>

1004
01:07:15,965 --> 01:07:18,195
Hello, Harvey,
running late?

1005
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:20,633
Your boyfriend
is in the closet.

1006
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,034
Excuse me, David.

1007
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:25,437
The Latino has locked himself
in the closet upstairs.

1008
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:27,271
Harvey, Harvey,
Phil Burton is here.

1009
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,402
He's likely the next
Speaker of the House

1010
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:32,845
and a very important ally
against Proposition 6.

1011
01:07:32,915 --> 01:07:34,906
So, please,
no scenes, all right?

1012
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:40,278
You're right.
I was late by 20 minutes.

1013
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:41,414
So come on out, Jack.

1014
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:45,324
Who were you with? Scott?
Or with a new boy you were trying to save?

1015
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:48,192
I was at work.
Come on out, sweet pea.

1016
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:49,925
You embarrassed me,
Harvey.

1017
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:52,900
I didn't know anyone down
there and they're bad people.

1018
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:56,767
I just want to go, okay?

1019
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:58,534
Then you should go home.

1020
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:02,734
No, I want to stay.
I want to stay here.

1021
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:06,179
So, you go away, okay?
Go away!

1022
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:14,113
The Briggs initiative is
polling at 75% for approval statewide.

1023
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:17,523
80% in other polls. Some even
have us losing San Francisco.

1024
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:20,118
We deceive people into
thinking we can beat this,

1025
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:22,494
we'll have riots and only
increase the backlash.

1026
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:23,998
That's a good point, David.

1027
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:27,433
Maybe we should just roll over and make
it easier for Briggs to fuck us in the ass.

1028
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:29,733
We're taking this very
seriously in my office.

1029
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:32,865
We want to send one of these to every
home in California and that takes money.

1030
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,410
"Proposition 6 is
an affront to human rights.

1031
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:39,676
"An invasion of the state into the
private lives of California citizens."

1032
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:42,915
Without a single mention of the
word gay on the entire flyer.

1033
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:44,509
By design, Harvey.

1034
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:46,487
Corey Wares is an out gay teacher...
- Rick...

1035
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:49,319
With the heat bearing down
on your movement right now,

1036
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:52,554
we feel it's best to dodge the gay
bullet. Go for the human rights angle.

1037
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:56,359
People need to know who it
is that's being affected.

1038
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:59,026
You need at least one
old queer on this flyer.

1039
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,001
Excuse me, yeah.
- Maybe you should volunteer for that, David.

1040
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:03,561
This is shit. This is
shit and masturbation.

1041
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,540
It's just a coward's response
to a dangerous threat.

1042
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:17,718
Come on, Jack.
It's time to go.

1043
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,179
Get everyone
together at your place.

1044
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:23,089
I want young people, I want
women, I want fresh heads.

1045
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,890
Get organizers and fighters,
not politicians. Come on, Jack.

1046
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:29,522
What about S-C-O-T-T?

1047
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,458
Yeah.

1048
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,529
Jack, come on.

1049
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:35,161
We have to
fight the machine.

1050
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:37,705
They don't want to change,
they want to stay in the past.

1051
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:39,400
Stop and be
realistic about it.

1052
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:43,434
Realistic? We're not interested in
staying in the closet, losing Prop 6.

1053
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:45,946
We're all on the same
side, man, we're on the same side.

1054
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:50,580
Hey, is anybody gonna pay the
pizza guy or we're just gonna stare?

1055
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:52,280
How could we not stare?

1056
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:55,449
Here, put out your hand.

1057
01:09:57,159 --> 01:10:00,185
You are shameless.
You are shameless.

1058
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:02,457
I mean, I'm proud of you
but you are hysterical.

1059
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:03,520
Hey.

1060
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:12,234
We're going to
convince the 90%

1061
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:15,707
to give a shit
about us 10%.

1062
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:18,872
We have to let them
know who we are.

1063
01:10:20,482 --> 01:10:23,246
Everybody has to come out.

1064
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:26,186
Across the entire state,
no matter where they live.

1065
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,213
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1066
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:31,726
If we're going to beat Prop 6,
we tell all of them to come out.

1067
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:35,890
Every gay lawyer, teacher,
doctor, dog catcher.

1068
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:37,990
We have to
leave the ghetto.

1069
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:43,027
We have to let all those people out
there know that they know one of us.

1070
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:45,335
And if somebody doesn't want
to step out of the closet,

1071
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:47,375
we open the door for them.

1072
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:48,603
Jesus.

1073
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:51,009
The whole state isn't
San Francisco, Harvey.

1074
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,342
Clearly, Scott.

1075
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,006
Harvey, that could
be really, really dangerous.

1076
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,313
I mean, there's such a
thing as a right to privacy.

1077
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:57,909
Privacy.

1078
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:00,979
In this movement,
at this time,

1079
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:05,254
I'm not saying this as a
supervisor, privacy is the enemy.

1080
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:11,295
And if you want real political
power, if that's what you want,

1081
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:13,961
try telling the truth
for a change.

1082
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:15,970
All right? Starting here.

1083
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:19,098
If there's anyone in
this room, right now,

1084
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:22,043
who hasn't told
their families,

1085
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,443
their friends,
their employers,

1086
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:27,014
do it now.

1087
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:30,082
My folks know already.

1088
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:34,046
My dad doesn't know yet.

1089
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,421
They vote for us
two to one.

1090
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:43,529
If they know,
they know one of us.

1091
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:56,371
As much as I'm sure
you'd all like to watch,

1092
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:58,743
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

1093
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:05,552
Cleve, could you show Dick where there's
a phone where he could speak in private?

1094
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,748
There's one in the bedroom.

1095
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:28,905
I just found myself clawing over
him, literally running to get him.

1096
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:30,808
Oh, good night.
- Good night.

1097
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:32,471
<i>Ciao,</i> gang.
- Sleep tight.

1098
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:35,244
I thought
you got out of politics.

1099
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:38,115
Politics.
Not the movement.

1100
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:40,454
What the hell
was that in there?

1101
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,080
The movement
needs people to be upfront.

1102
01:12:42,157 --> 01:12:43,988
Why were you
fighting me in there?

1103
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:48,018
Those are kids in there. You're
asking them to lose their families.

1104
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:51,794
If their families don't
love them for who they are,

1105
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,199
who they really are, then
they should lose them.

1106
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:56,032
That's fucking insane.

1107
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:58,505
You were the biggest
closet case in New York.

1108
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:01,099
You asked me and all your
boyfriends to keep our traps shut.

1109
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:02,734
I mean, you're being the hypocrite.

1110
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:06,440
My parents are gone. My brother
knew. I'm sure they knew.

1111
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:11,686
How many times did I have
to listen to calls to Mom,

1112
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:13,813
where you
denied my existence?

1113
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:17,052
And you want to be normal like
anybody. More than anybody.

1114
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:22,991
Who's he?
You live together?

1115
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:25,724
Someone I'm seeing.

1116
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:28,663
Keeps me out of
trouble, out of the bars.

1117
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:32,000
I miss you.

1118
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:34,241
Harvey,

1119
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:36,977
what's that about?

1120
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:38,945
Harvey.

1121
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:41,606
He needs me.

1122
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:55,326
If there is an air of dishonesty
with this board and its members,

1123
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:56,591
that is repugnant...

1124
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:59,657
I have told no lies today or
to Supervisor White in the past.

1125
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:01,168
Supervisor Milk,
you will come to order.

1126
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:03,830
I would like it
noted that I never promised

1127
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:05,737
to back moving any
mental health centers.

1128
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:09,869
And that with great respect to Supervisor
White, I would like his remarks stricken.

1129
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:14,177
Duly noted. We will take a 10 minute
recess before recording the vote.

1130
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:17,975
Thank you, Harvey.

1131
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:22,648
Can I have a moment with Harvey?
Alone, please, Carol?

1132
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:30,663
Why? Why are you
turning on me like this?

1133
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:32,666
At the last minute?
What did I do?

1134
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:33,826
I never
got the details.

1135
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:36,427
Dan, if you want me to help
you draft another version of it

1136
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:40,942
that doesn't shanghai every troubled
kid in your area, I'll be happy to.

1137
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:45,776
Harvey, I can't go back to my family,
to my folks, to my district without this.

1138
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:47,839
Don't do this.
- Well, I have a lot of pressure on me.

1139
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:49,474
So, you're just
stringing me along

1140
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:51,018
and then you're just gonna throw
me to the wolves, is that it?

1141
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:52,246
Dan, you only need
one more vote.

1142
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:55,017
You've got five other supervisors
you can convince besides me.

1143
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:58,082
I'm gonna vote against your queer law
and I'm gonna get Quentin against it, too.

1144
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,788
Oh, it's gonna pass anyway and you
can't keep alienating yourself here, Dan.

1145
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:04,355
I gave you a chance, Harvey, okay?
I gave you a chance and you blew it!

1146
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:07,658
You blew it.

1147
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:15,038
<i>The city council in</i>
<i>St. Paul, Minnesota</i>

1148
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:17,544
<i>passed a law guaranteeing,</i>
<i>among other things,</i>

1149
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:20,741
<i>equal rights in housing,</i>
<i>employment and education,</i>

1150
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:23,011
<i>regardless of</i>
<i>sexual preference.</i>

1151
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:25,553
<i>Now, voters in that city have</i>
<i>made their disapproval clear.</i>

1152
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:29,990
<i>Homosexuality is a question facing
the voters of Eugene, Oregon tomorrow.</i>

1153
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:32,720
<i>A referendum to repeal</i>
<i>gay rights protection.</i>

1154
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:38,260
So, while we were fighting
Proposition 6 and Briggs in California,

1155
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:41,562
I needed to put
a show on the road.

1156
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:45,637
And our next stop,
Wichita, Kansas.

1157
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:49,370
<i>Voters of Wichita, Kansas</i>
<i>have overwhelmingly repealed</i>

1158
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:51,605
<i>a city law</i>
<i>protecting homosexuals</i>

1159
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:54,171
<i>against discrimination</i>
<i>in jobs and housing.</i>

1160
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:56,513
<i>Only two hours after
the polls closed,</i>

1161
01:15:56,585 --> 01:16:00,919
<i>the church organization that started the
repeal action was celebrating victory.</i>

1162
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:06,992
Hey, Lawrence, it's Cleve.

1163
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:08,324
Hey, we're losing Wichita.

1164
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:11,594
So rally tonight sundown
at Market and Castro, okay?

1165
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:12,998
Okay, bye.

1166
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:16,293
Hello?

1167
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:31,718
Jerry. Hey, we're losing Wichita...

1168
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:43,387
They're moving.
I don't know where.

1169
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:45,865
Did Jim call the press? You
get out there with your camera.

1170
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:48,903
Press is covered. But we
don't have a permit to march.

1171
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,398
Hurry up.

1172
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:02,717
When I got Coors beer out of the
bars, the union boys gave me this.

1173
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:04,775
I want you
to take it now.

1174
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:07,045
What am I supposed
to do with this?

1175
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:08,783
You're an activist now,
you're gonna march them.

1176
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:11,189
I want you to march them right up
to the front doors of City Hall.

1177
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:13,853
When things start
to look really bad,

1178
01:17:13,929 --> 01:17:18,093
the city's first gay supervisor
will come out and play peacemaker.

1179
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:21,130
Do it with me.

1180
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:31,539
<i>Hello.</i>

1181
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:35,080
<i>Forty years ago, tonight,</i>

1182
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:40,554
<i>the gay citizens of Germany found
out they no longer had civil rights.</i>

1183
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:48,088
<i>Tomorrow morning, the gay citizens
of Wichita will also awaken</i>

1184
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:52,190
<i>to find that they too</i>
<i>have lost their civil rights!</i>

1185
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:56,704
<i>You have whistles. You use them
when we have been attacked.</i>

1186
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:58,867
<i>Tonight we have been attacked.</i>

1187
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:01,135
Come on, the crowd
is leaving without us!

1188
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:02,699
Shit!

1189
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:30,535
Get the press
to the marquee.

1190
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:33,073
<i>Move left! Move left!</i>

1191
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:35,200
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Where's Harvey?

1192
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:37,711
We're shutting down traffic,
both directions.

1193
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:38,973
<i>Cameras are rolling.</i>

1194
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:41,208
Okay, disconnect
the power arm!

1195
01:18:57,532 --> 01:19:01,059
<i>Civil rights or civil war!</i>
<i>Gay rights now!</i>

1196
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:04,162
<i>Civil rights or civil war!</i>
<i>Gay rights now!</i>

1197
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:18,813
Civil rights or civil war!
Gay rights now!

1198
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:22,414
Civil rights or civil war!
Gay rights now!

1199
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:26,018
Civil rights or civil war!
Gay rights now!

1200
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,356
<i>Anita!</i>

1201
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:31,559
<i>Anita, you're a liar!</i>
<i>We'll set your hair on fire!</i>

1202
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:33,498
Anita, you're a liar!

1203
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:36,662
Anita, you're a liar!
We'll set your hair on fire!

1204
01:19:36,738 --> 01:19:40,435
Anita, you're a liar!
We'll set your hair on fire!

1205
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:09,302
Okay, okay!

1206
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:13,902
<i>My name is Harvey Milk</i>
<i>and I'm here to recruit you.</i>

1207
01:20:16,011 --> 01:20:19,310
They're calling it
a successful mediation.

1208
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:23,545
You're a goddamn hero. Fuck,
we came this close to a riot.

1209
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:27,154
Next time
put down the note cards.

1210
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:31,181
You got to keep talking into that bullhorn
and tell them what they're feeling.

1211
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:34,285
Oh, you're just jealous
it wasn't you out there.

1212
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:36,830
We're losing
Proposition 6 by 60%,

1213
01:20:36,898 --> 01:20:38,866
and you're over there
celebrating a riot.

1214
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:40,902
What we need is exposure.

1215
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:42,493
If we're gonna
beat this thing,

1216
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:44,801
we got to get Briggs
to acknowledge it.

1217
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:48,309
Every paper's calling
Prop 6 the main event now.

1218
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:51,937
We lose this, we'll have
anti-gay laws in all 50 states,

1219
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:54,277
and Briggs won't answer our
calls for a public debate.

1220
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:56,010
He's trying
to ignore us to death.

1221
01:20:56,084 --> 01:20:58,211
We need
something populist.

1222
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:02,446
What's the number one
problem in this city?

1223
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:05,015
The fucking piss
smell in the tenderloin.

1224
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:06,253
Close.

1225
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:07,693
Dog shit.

1226
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:11,290
If you clean up the dog shit in
this town, you're the next mayor.

1227
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:13,391
<i>Supervisor Milk</i>
<i>took to the grassy lawn</i>

1228
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:16,096
<i>at Duboce Park this afternoon
to publicize the new law.</i>

1229
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:19,140
Dog mess is a hazard and on
top of that, it's disgusting.

1230
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:23,234
So under the new ordinance, all dog
owners who don't clean up their mess

1231
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:24,403
will be fined.

1232
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:27,414
<i>Milk put his foot down to emphasize
that the city intends to enforce,</i>

1233
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:29,245
<i>and you guessed it.</i>

1234
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:33,117
<i>In Supervisor Milk's words,</i>
<i>"This really is the bottom line. "

1235
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:34,448
<i>Aye.</i>

1236
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:37,616
Lau, aye.
Supervisor Hutch?

1237
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:38,750
Aye.

1238
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:42,126
Hutch, aye.
Supervisor White?

1239
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:44,690
No.

1240
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:48,167
White, no.
Supervisor Silver?

1241
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:49,567
Aye.

1242
01:21:49,638 --> 01:21:52,801
Silver, aye.
Supervisor Milk?

1243
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,001
Aye.

1244
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:56,976
Milk, aye.

1245
01:21:57,045 --> 01:22:01,243
Madam President,
I have ten ayes and one no.

1246
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:04,046
The San Francisco
Gay Rights Ordinance

1247
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:08,886
sponsored by Supervisors
Milk and Silver is passed.

1248
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:18,932
I can't get my stories on
page ten, you're getting page one?

1249
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,093
Doggy-doo is a
real issue, George.

1250
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:26,565
A powder blue pen to sign the
city's first gay rights law.

1251
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:32,673
I don't do this enough, taking
swift and unambiguous action

1252
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:35,272
on a substantive
move for civil rights.

1253
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,318
Congratulations.

1254
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:41,753
George, we need your
help with Briggs.

1255
01:22:41,823 --> 01:22:45,224
The gay community will have your
back on every issue from now on.

1256
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:47,022
We hope you'll have ours.

1257
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:57,698
What are you
working on, Dan?

1258
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:00,574
If you have something
to discuss, Harvey,

1259
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:03,873
you can have your aide make
an appointment with my aide.

1260
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:06,971
Dan, I know you're upset
about the psychiatric center.

1261
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,884
What else do you
have coming up?

1262
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:12,681
Now you need
something from me.

1263
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:17,485
What do you want, me to support the
queers against Prop 6, is that it?

1264
01:23:17,559 --> 01:23:20,050
We prefer the term gay, Dan.

1265
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:24,087
Just as I'm sure you prefer the
term Irish-American instead of mick.

1266
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:28,294
Harvey, a society can't
exist without the family.

1267
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:30,065
We're not against that.
- You're not?

1268
01:23:30,138 --> 01:23:31,901
What, can two men reproduce?

1269
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:32,962
No.

1270
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:34,804
But God knows
we keep trying.

1271
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:39,977
This isn't you, Dan.

1272
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:42,710
It's like you're channeling
Anita and Briggs.

1273
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:46,216
We got to be able to work
together on something.

1274
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,650
Okay, Milk,

1275
01:23:50,592 --> 01:23:53,584
introduce an initiative
for supervisor pay raises.

1276
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:55,891
Dan, we both have elections
coming up. We can't do that.

1277
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:58,091
No, you asked for something.

1278
01:23:58,166 --> 01:24:02,432
Introduce pay raises, 'cause I can't
take care of my family on our salaries.

1279
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:05,302
You don't have that
problem, do you?

1280
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:17,150
<i>Senator John Briggs</i>
<i>apparently has not flinched</i>

1281
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:21,314
<i>in the face of statewide</i>
<i>criticism of his anti-gay crusade.</i>

1282
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:24,847
<i>He says polls show most of the
people are still on his side.</i>

1283
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:28,555
<i>Especially those concerned with the
preservation of the American family.</i>

1284
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:33,397
<i>If these people are going to live
a life of such open homosexuality,</i>

1285
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:38,131
<i>that they want a 21 gun salute every
time somebody walks by them,</i>

1286
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:43,969
<i>those people are going to be in danger
of being removed from their job.</i>

1287
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:49,974
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1288
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:55,853
<i>Happy birthday, dear Harvey</i>

1289
01:24:55,924 --> 01:25:00,987
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1290
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:27,154
What's wrong, taco?

1291
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:29,315
It's just that
Cleve and Anne,

1292
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:31,915
they tried to cut me
out of your table, baby.

1293
01:25:31,993 --> 01:25:34,723
I'm so sick of them.
You should fire them.

1294
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:38,225
I'll take it
under consideration.

1295
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:40,733
Would you go
get us some cake?

1296
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:42,030
Cake?
- Yeah.

1297
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:43,695
Whatever you want.

1298
01:25:48,743 --> 01:25:51,143
Don't let Cesar Chavez
hear you calling him taco.

1299
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:54,978
He's getting much better.
He's enrolling in classes on Monday, I hope.

1300
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:57,142
You know, I remember
when your birthdays were

1301
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:59,209
a lot less lavish and
a little more intimate.

1302
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:00,811
Who invited you? Anne?

1303
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:04,120
No, my boyfriend.
I'm his plus one.

1304
01:26:05,793 --> 01:26:08,421
Well, congratulations.
It was a very hard ticket to get.

1305
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:12,159
Congratulations to you. Looks like
you're part of the machine now.

1306
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:15,993
By the way,
you can do better.

1307
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:19,195
When I come home to Jack,
I don't have to talk politics,

1308
01:26:19,274 --> 01:26:22,607
I don't have to talk intelligently.
I don't have to talk at all.

1309
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:27,046
And besides, where's an ugly old man like
me gonna find a handsome young man like that?

1310
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:30,312
You're not that old
and you look handsome.

1311
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:35,582
Happy 48. Looks like you're gonna
make it to 50 after all, Mr. Milk.

1312
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,027
Harvey!

1313
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:55,533
Harvey, Harvey!

1314
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:57,510
Is your birthday party
over?

1315
01:26:57,579 --> 01:26:59,809
Well, it's just
winding down. Hi.

1316
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:03,009
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday party.

1317
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:05,518
No, it's no problem.
It's good to see you, Dan.

1318
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:07,817
I'm sorry. It's good
to see you too, Harvey.

1319
01:27:09,257 --> 01:27:13,694
Oh, I wanted to ask
you about the dog poop.

1320
01:27:13,761 --> 01:27:15,228
Yeah.

1321
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:18,094
That's good.
It's a really good one.

1322
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:19,690
It's a good one.

1323
01:27:19,767 --> 01:27:21,701
Hey, I got you
a little something.

1324
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:23,531
You didn't have to.

1325
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:25,072
I knew you were
going to say that.

1326
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:26,868
Why do people
always say that?

1327
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:29,876
"You didn't have to."
I mean, of course, right?

1328
01:27:29,944 --> 01:27:31,809
But that's what
they always say.

1329
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:34,177
They always say
things like that.

1330
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:35,841
Always.

1331
01:27:36,851 --> 01:27:38,318
Are you okay, Dan?

1332
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,478
Yeah.

1333
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:42,079
Are you okay, Harvey?

1334
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:44,956
Are we okay?
- Okay.

1335
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:47,494
I've learned a lot from watching you.
- I doubt that.

1336
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:51,225
No, I have. I've realized
you just gotta get out there.

1337
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:54,200
You gotta be noticed, 'cause
that's how it all works.

1338
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:57,705
But you have an issue.
See, that's your advantage.

1339
01:28:00,141 --> 01:28:01,540
That's an advantage.

1340
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:04,373
Dan,
it's more than an issue.

1341
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:06,638
What?
- I...

1342
01:28:07,715 --> 01:28:12,152
Dan, I have had four
relationships in my life.

1343
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:15,417
And three of them have tried to
commit suicide. And that's my fault,

1344
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:18,891
because I kept them hidden and quiet,
because I was closeted and weak.

1345
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,520
You see what I'm saying?
- Yes.

1346
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:23,587
You do?
- Mmm-hmm.

1347
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:28,432
This is not just jobs or issues,
this is our lives we're fighting for.

1348
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:30,198
Okay?
- All right.

1349
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:32,330
Okay, Dan...
- I've learned a lot from you, Harvey.

1350
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:33,669
I'm getting back
to my party now.

1351
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:35,709
I'm going to get my
picture in the papers, too.

1352
01:28:35,777 --> 01:28:39,508
Why are you even here? Why did
you just show up from somewhere?

1353
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:42,310
I've got my own issues.
- Okay.

1354
01:28:42,383 --> 01:28:44,442
I've got my own issues.
- Thank you.

1355
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:46,885
"Thank you." Whatever.

1356
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:52,586
I don't even know who you are. You just
showed up out of nowhere, Latino man.

1357
01:28:53,761 --> 01:28:56,286
Dan White's got an issue!

1358
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,236
<i>John Briggs said this morning that Dade
County, Oklahoma, and St. Paul, Minnesota</i>

1359
01:29:02,303 --> 01:29:04,066
<i>were only preliminary battles.</i>

1360
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:09,075
<i>He called his California campaign against
homosexual teachers the main event.</i>

1361
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:11,771
<i>What it's doing,</i>
<i>what these people are doing is</i>

1362
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:15,407
<i>changing our morals from our religious background.</i>
<i>And I don't want that.</i>

1363
01:30:02,230 --> 01:30:04,323
This came in
the mail today.

1364
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:09,533
"You get the first bullet the
minute you stand at the microphone."

1365
01:30:09,604 --> 01:30:11,162
<i>... Supervisor Harvey Milk.</i>

1366
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:14,402
Well, publicity's working.

1367
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:16,409
You don't have
to go up there.

1368
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:20,376
The whole nation is watching.
I have to go.

1369
01:30:34,962 --> 01:30:39,592
<i>My name is Harvey Milk</i>
<i>and I'm here to recruit you!</i>

1370
01:30:41,836 --> 01:30:46,864
<i>I want to recruit you for the
fight to preserve your democracy!</i>

1371
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:50,604
<i>Brothers and sisters,</i>
<i>you must come out!</i>

1372
01:30:50,678 --> 01:30:52,839
<i>Come out to your parents,</i>

1373
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:57,214
<i>come out to your friends,</i>
<i>if indeed they are your friends.</i>

1374
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:01,119
<i>Come out to your neighbors,</i>
<i>come out to your fellow workers.</i>

1375
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:05,182
<i>Once and for all,</i>
<i>let's break down the myths</i>

1376
01:31:05,259 --> 01:31:08,990
<i>and destroy the lies</i>
<i>and distortions.</i>

1377
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:15,334
<i>For your sake,</i>
<i>for their sake.</i>

1378
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:20,067
<i>For the sake of all the
youngsters who've been scared</i>

1379
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:23,110
<i>by the votes</i>
<i>from Dade to Eugene.</i>

1380
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:29,711
<i>On the Statue of Liberty,</i>
<i>it says,</i>

1381
01:31:30,585 --> 01:31:36,990
<i>" Give me your tired, your poor, your
huddled masses yearning to be free. "

1382
01:31:39,427 --> 01:31:42,624
<i>In the Declaration of</i>
<i>Independence it is written,</i>

1383
01:31:43,197 --> 01:31:50,569
<i>"All men are created equal and
endowed with certain inalienable rights. "

1384
01:31:58,112 --> 01:32:01,047
<i>So, for Mr. Briggs,</i>

1385
01:32:04,285 --> 01:32:05,616
<i>and Mrs. Bryant,</i>

1386
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:11,287
<i>and all the bigots</i>
<i>out there,</i>

1387
01:32:12,827 --> 01:32:15,421
<i>no matter how hard you try,</i>

1388
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:20,763
<i>you can never erase those words from
the Declaration of Independence!</i>

1389
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:26,102
<i>No matter how hard you try,</i>
<i>you can never chip those words</i>

1390
01:32:26,173 --> 01:32:29,267
<i>from the base of</i>
<i>the Statue of Liberty!</i>

1391
01:32:29,343 --> 01:32:32,835
<i>That is where America is!</i>

1392
01:32:32,914 --> 01:32:35,144
<i>Love it or leave it!</i>

1393
01:32:45,092 --> 01:32:48,186
Okay, the mayor says Briggs is on his way
here and that he could intercept him for us.

1394
01:32:48,262 --> 01:32:50,025
We could get him face to face.
- Go get the press.

1395
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:51,428
All right.

1396
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:57,232
Well, I see naked men walking
around, naked women walking around,

1397
01:32:57,305 --> 01:33:01,639
which doesn't bother me as far as
my personal standards of nudity,

1398
01:33:01,709 --> 01:33:06,578
but it's not proper. It wouldn't be allowed
for any other parade in San Francisco,

1399
01:33:06,647 --> 01:33:09,013
and it should not be
allowed for the Gay Parade.

1400
01:33:47,521 --> 01:33:49,580
I have a right to be at
this parade, Mr. Mayor.

1401
01:33:49,657 --> 01:33:51,591
I'm afraid it's not in the
interest of your safety,

1402
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:54,787
or my public's safety to let
you into these parade grounds.

1403
01:33:56,430 --> 01:34:00,025
I'm Harvey Milk. It's an
honor to meet you, Mr. Briggs.

1404
01:34:01,869 --> 01:34:03,461
Yeah, no, I'm aware.

1405
01:34:03,537 --> 01:34:07,132
You know, it's sad, Mr. Milk, that
you're afraid to fight this out in public.

1406
01:34:07,208 --> 01:34:08,300
Oh, that's not true.

1407
01:34:08,376 --> 01:34:10,139
I'd very much like to have
a public debate with you.

1408
01:34:10,211 --> 01:34:12,441
I'm very interested in the
details of your argument.

1409
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:15,812
Oh, well, you know,
you know the details.

1410
01:34:15,883 --> 01:34:19,785
I mean, just look at the votes across
this nation. The public is with me.

1411
01:34:19,854 --> 01:34:21,253
They are today.

1412
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:23,552
Which is why
with my city's mayor

1413
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:26,024
and the San Francisco
press as my witnesses,

1414
01:34:26,093 --> 01:34:28,653
I'd like to challenge
you to a public debate.

1415
01:34:33,934 --> 01:34:35,526
Oh, I think
that's a yes.

1416
01:34:38,005 --> 01:34:42,567
<i>You know, Mr. Milk, we don't allow
people who practice bestiality</i>

1417
01:34:42,643 --> 01:34:45,111
<i>to teach our
children, and... Excuse me,</i>

1418
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:47,409
<i>and the reason we don't</i>
<i>is because it is illegal.</i>

1419
01:34:47,481 --> 01:34:50,575
<i>It is not illegal to be a
homosexual in California.</i>

1420
01:34:50,651 --> 01:34:52,585
<i>And your law goes</i>
<i>even further.</i>

1421
01:34:53,421 --> 01:34:57,084
<i>Any school employee who even
supports a gay person will be fired.</i>

1422
01:34:57,158 --> 01:34:59,956
<i>Well, that's true. But gay people
don't have any children of their own.</i>

1423
01:35:00,027 --> 01:35:02,587
<i>And if they don't recruit our
children, they'd all just die away.</i>

1424
01:35:03,898 --> 01:35:06,492
<i>You know? And that's why they're all
so interested in becoming teachers,</i>

1425
01:35:06,567 --> 01:35:10,526
<i>because they want to encourage</i>
<i>our children to join them.</i>

1426
01:35:12,506 --> 01:35:14,098
<i>And how do you</i>
<i>teach homosexuality?</i>

1427
01:35:14,175 --> 01:35:15,199
<i>It's like French?</i>

1428
01:35:18,145 --> 01:35:20,511
<i>I was born of</i>
<i>heterosexual parents,</i>

1429
01:35:20,581 --> 01:35:22,674
<i>taught by</i>
<i>heterosexual teachers</i>

1430
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:25,378
<i>in a fiercely</i>
<i>heterosexual society.</i>

1431
01:35:25,453 --> 01:35:27,580
<i>So why then</i>
<i>am I homosexual?</i>

1432
01:35:27,655 --> 01:35:29,350
<i>And no offense meant,</i>

1433
01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:32,290
<i>but if it were true that children
mimicked their teachers,</i>

1434
01:35:32,359 --> 01:35:34,520
<i>we'd have a hell of a lot</i>
<i>more nuns running around.</i>

1435
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:47,032
We were really, genuinely
frightened by Proposition 6.

1436
01:35:48,275 --> 01:35:52,473
And with Anita and Briggs gaining
strength, we were very pessimistic.

1437
01:35:53,514 --> 01:35:56,540
We didn't think that there was
any chance that we could beat it.

1438
01:35:56,617 --> 01:35:59,085
But what we did hope for

1439
01:35:59,153 --> 01:36:01,485
<i>is that we could</i>
<i>organize enough,</i>

1440
01:36:02,123 --> 01:36:06,025
<i>so that when we did lose,</i>
<i>all hell would break loose.</i>

1441
01:36:06,093 --> 01:36:09,221
We're still losing 60-30. We got
to take this show on the road.

1442
01:36:09,296 --> 01:36:10,695
Put out a press release.

1443
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:13,825
Call Briggs' office, tell him he
can pick the audience, the town.

1444
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:15,835
I'll tell my supporters
to stay away.

1445
01:36:15,903 --> 01:36:19,464
Harvey, his audiences are
intensely devout. You'll get killed.

1446
01:36:20,207 --> 01:36:22,141
Get me Orange County.

1447
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:26,202
<i>In your statements here and all
these newspapers and tonight,</i>

1448
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,078
<i>you say that child</i>
<i>molestation is not an issue.</i>

1449
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:30,845
<i>If it's not an issue,</i>

1450
01:36:30,918 --> 01:36:34,410
<i>why do you put out</i>
<i>literature that hammers it home?</i>

1451
01:36:34,488 --> 01:36:37,924
<i>Why do you play
on this myth and fear?</i>

1452
01:36:37,992 --> 01:36:40,426
<i>Same thing with VD, Harvey,</i>
<i>we put out publications...</i>

1453
01:36:40,494 --> 01:36:41,654
<i>This is campaign</i>
<i>literature.</i>

1454
01:36:41,729 --> 01:36:45,324
<i>Well, we put out publications
about VD so you can avoid it.</i>

1455
01:36:52,173 --> 01:36:55,802
<i>You yourself had said that there's more
molestation in the heterosexual group,</i>

1456
01:36:55,876 --> 01:36:59,073
<i>so why not get rid
of the heterosexual teachers?</i>

1457
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:02,809
<i>We are not talking about
homosex... About child molestation.</i>

1458
01:37:02,883 --> 01:37:08,651
<i>Nearly... The fact is, nearly 95
percent of the people are heterosexual,</i>

1459
01:37:08,722 --> 01:37:12,021
<i>so, if we took the heterosexuals
out and the homosexuals out,</i>

1460
01:37:12,092 --> 01:37:13,753
<i>you know what,</i>
<i>we'd have no teachers.</i>

1461
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:15,056
<i>We'd have no teachers,</i>
<i>no more molestation.</i>

1462
01:37:15,129 --> 01:37:17,359
<i>So you're saying that the
percentage of the population</i>

1463
01:37:17,431 --> 01:37:18,693
<i>is equal to the percentage</i>
<i>of child molestation?</i>

1464
01:37:18,766 --> 01:37:20,734
<i>No, no, no,</i>
<i>I'm not saying that, no.</i>

1465
01:37:20,801 --> 01:37:22,268
<i>That's what</i>
<i>you just said.</i>

1466
01:37:22,336 --> 01:37:24,600
<i>No, no, no. I'm not saying that at
all. I am saying that we can't prevent</i>

1467
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:27,266
<i>child molestation, so let's
just cut our odds down</i>

1468
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:31,141
<i>by taking out the homosexuals and
keeping in the heterosexual groups.</i>

1469
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:37,712
<i>Sir, in your drive</i>
<i>for personal power,</i>

1470
01:37:37,785 --> 01:37:40,379
<i>how many careers are you</i>
<i>willing to see destroyed?</i>

1471
01:37:40,454 --> 01:37:45,585
<i>How many lives, in your lust for power,
will you destroy and when will it stop?</i>

1472
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:00,568
Jack, what is it?

1473
01:38:00,641 --> 01:38:02,905
<i>Nothing.</i>
<i>Just wondering when you'll be home.</i>

1474
01:38:02,977 --> 01:38:06,435
You just had them pull me out of my big
vote on the dog shit ordinance for this?

1475
01:38:06,513 --> 01:38:08,413
What, do you do
this on purpose?

1476
01:38:08,482 --> 01:38:10,507
Fuck, Harvey,
it's poop, okay?

1477
01:38:10,584 --> 01:38:13,280
I just hope I'm more
important than poop.

1478
01:38:13,354 --> 01:38:17,723
<i>Look, it's... I just... I don't
know what time I'll be home.</i>

1479
01:38:17,791 --> 01:38:19,258
6:00 or 6:15.

1480
01:38:19,326 --> 01:38:20,816
<i>Okay.</i>
- Okay?

1481
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:22,624
I'm all right.
I'll see you then.

1482
01:38:22,696 --> 01:38:24,186
<i> Okay.</i>
<i>6:15, then.</i>

1483
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:29,961
Dan, how's the baby?

1484
01:38:30,037 --> 01:38:32,437
You didn't bring up
supervisor pay raises?

1485
01:38:32,506 --> 01:38:35,634
In fact, I heard that you
plan to publicly oppose them.

1486
01:38:35,709 --> 01:38:37,677
Well, I heard that you
planned to vote against them, too.

1487
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:39,144
Were you setting me up?

1488
01:38:39,213 --> 01:38:42,046
It's not a good time
for me, politically speaking.

1489
01:38:42,650 --> 01:38:45,915
Dan, there's a vote on the
Police Desegregation Settlement.

1490
01:38:45,986 --> 01:38:48,284
You give me that and I'll
consider backing pay raises.

1491
01:38:48,355 --> 01:38:50,448
I don't trade votes.

1492
01:38:50,524 --> 01:38:52,014
Unlike you,
the way I was raised,

1493
01:38:52,092 --> 01:38:55,027
we believe in right and wrong.
Moral and immoral.

1494
01:38:55,095 --> 01:38:57,689
Black skin and white
in the police department.

1495
01:38:57,765 --> 01:39:01,462
Dan, even Ronald Reagan
is opposed to Proposition 6.

1496
01:39:01,535 --> 01:39:03,435
You're looking more
and more out of touch.

1497
01:39:03,504 --> 01:39:06,234
Okay, if I come out against Prop 6,
it's only going to be for the invasion

1498
01:39:06,307 --> 01:39:07,831
of state's rights issue,
that's it.

1499
01:39:07,908 --> 01:39:10,103
And the potential witch hunt
against you straight people.

1500
01:39:12,913 --> 01:39:16,474
You can't humiliate
me, okay?

1501
01:39:17,151 --> 01:39:20,177
You will not demean me.

1502
01:39:24,725 --> 01:39:28,661
Harvey, we're doing the final vote.
We need to get you back.

1503
01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:44,370
Jack?

1504
01:39:48,048 --> 01:39:49,208
Jack?

1505
01:39:56,623 --> 01:39:57,749
Jack?

1506
01:40:12,339 --> 01:40:13,772
Oh!

1507
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:15,866
No, Jack. Jack, no!

1508
01:40:15,943 --> 01:40:19,174
No, no, no. Jack, no.

1509
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:22,838
Jack!

1510
01:40:23,751 --> 01:40:27,881
No, no, no, no!
Oh, no!

1511
01:40:34,094 --> 01:40:35,527
Harvey,

1512
01:40:36,997 --> 01:40:38,396
look at me.

1513
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,265
Hey, look at me.

1514
01:40:42,336 --> 01:40:44,497
You did everything
that you could.

1515
01:40:47,574 --> 01:40:49,235
No, I didn't.

1516
01:40:50,711 --> 01:40:52,611
What more could
you have done?

1517
01:40:54,715 --> 01:40:59,778
I could have come back
at 6:00 instead of 6:15.

1518
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:04,257
Shh.

1519
01:41:06,794 --> 01:41:09,854
Jack was gone.
I didn't have any time to mourn.

1520
01:41:09,930 --> 01:41:11,591
There was no choice.

1521
01:41:12,266 --> 01:41:15,633
I had to keep on...
Keep on fighting.

1522
01:41:17,671 --> 01:41:19,536
<i>Most California political leaders,</i>

1523
01:41:19,606 --> 01:41:22,666
<i>from Governor Jerry Brown to</i>
<i>former Governor Ronald Reagan,</i>

1524
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:26,372
<i>say there are already enough</i>
<i>laws on the books to protect children.</i>

1525
01:41:26,447 --> 01:41:28,847
<i>If you allow one,</i>
<i>just one human being</i>

1526
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:32,215
<i>to be allowed to have his</i>
<i>rights taken away from him,</i>

1527
01:41:32,286 --> 01:41:34,117
<i>as a human being</i>
<i>then, pal,</i>

1528
01:41:34,188 --> 01:41:36,520
<i>you don't have any right when they
come to take away your rights!</i>

1529
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:39,184
<i>You do what you want in</i>
<i>the privacy of your own home.</i>

1530
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:41,557
<i>But don't tell me I got
to accept it in mine.</i>

1531
01:41:49,503 --> 01:41:51,835
San Bernadino is coming in.
Not good.

1532
01:41:51,905 --> 01:41:53,236
Of course not.
How not good?

1533
01:41:53,307 --> 01:41:55,707
60% for Briggs.
Same in Fresno.

1534
01:41:55,776 --> 01:41:57,767
Oh, dear God,
Lotus Blossom.

1535
01:41:57,845 --> 01:42:00,973
Imperial is
69% for so far.

1536
01:42:01,048 --> 01:42:02,481
Put it on the board.

1537
01:42:02,549 --> 01:42:05,780
<i>I love homosexuals,</i>
<i>if you can believe that.</i>

1538
01:42:05,853 --> 01:42:07,548
<i>I love them enough</i>
<i>to tell them the truth.</i>

1539
01:42:07,621 --> 01:42:11,523
<i>I think that if it were passed, it would
be just what some people would need</i>

1540
01:42:11,592 --> 01:42:13,321
<i>to conduct a very</i>
<i>severe witch hunt.</i>

1541
01:42:13,393 --> 01:42:16,794
<i>What I ask, everybody to</i>
<i>vote against Proposition 6.</i>

1542
01:42:22,769 --> 01:42:27,035
The whole world is watching. This is
San Francisco we're losing. You ready?

1543
01:42:27,841 --> 01:42:31,004
I can have 15,000
people here in an hour,

1544
01:42:31,078 --> 01:42:33,444
but there's gonna be
riots if this thing passes.

1545
01:42:33,514 --> 01:42:35,345
There goddamn
well better be.

1546
01:42:36,517 --> 01:42:38,109
What are you telling me?

1547
01:42:38,185 --> 01:42:40,619
I can't say this because
I'm a public official,

1548
01:42:40,687 --> 01:42:44,885
but if this thing passes,
fight the hell back.

1549
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:47,518
<i>It was fundamentalist</i>
<i>Christians who helped Briggs</i>

1550
01:42:47,594 --> 01:42:51,155
<i>gather most of the signatures to
put Proposition 6 on today's ballot.</i>

1551
01:42:51,231 --> 01:42:53,461
<i>The Christian community
had never been involved</i>

1552
01:42:53,534 --> 01:42:55,764
<i>in any political</i>
<i>controversial issue.</i>

1553
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:58,634
<i>And they're not only
involved, but they're committed.</i>

1554
01:42:58,705 --> 01:43:01,230
<i>They've not only been working very hard, but
they're going to come out and vote today.</i>

1555
01:43:01,308 --> 01:43:03,868
<i>" Thou shalt love thy</i>
<i>neighbor as thyself. "

1556
01:43:03,944 --> 01:43:06,572
<i>And I would like to know</i>
<i>how you, Senator Briggs,</i>

1557
01:43:06,647 --> 01:43:11,710
<i>believe that Proposition 6 <i>will help
children learn how to accept people</i>

1558
01:43:11,785 --> 01:43:13,275
<i>who are different</i>
<i>from themselves.</i>

1559
01:43:13,353 --> 01:43:15,548
Harvey,
Don Amador from LA.

1560
01:43:17,157 --> 01:43:18,385
Not a good time, Don.

1561
01:43:18,458 --> 01:43:21,188
<i>No, sir, this is Paul.</i>
<i>Don just gave me the phone.</i>

1562
01:43:21,261 --> 01:43:22,387
Paul who?

1563
01:43:22,462 --> 01:43:24,327
<i>You spoke to me on the</i>
<i>phone a year or so ago.</i>

1564
01:43:24,398 --> 01:43:27,595
<i>I'm in a wheelchair.</i>
<i>I'm from Minnesota.</i>

1565
01:43:27,668 --> 01:43:30,068
I thought you were
a goner, Paul.

1566
01:43:30,804 --> 01:43:33,967
When I saw that you
won the supervisor seat,

1567
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:36,509
I got a friend to
put me on a bus to LA.

1568
01:43:36,577 --> 01:43:38,511
<i>Who do you know</i>
<i>in Los Angeles?</i>

1569
01:43:39,746 --> 01:43:41,338
Nobody.

1570
01:43:41,415 --> 01:43:43,007
That's the...

1571
01:43:45,185 --> 01:43:46,948
I just didn't
want to die anymore.

1572
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:49,250
<i>I met your friend Don</i>
<i>down here.</i>

1573
01:43:49,323 --> 01:43:52,087
<i>I turned 18 and I
voted today against Prop 6.</i>

1574
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:54,457
<i>I don't think I'd be alive
right now if it weren't for you.</i>

1575
01:43:54,528 --> 01:43:56,462
No, you did that all
by yourself, Paul.

1576
01:43:56,530 --> 01:43:59,090
<i>Don wanted me to congratulate
you on what he says</i>

1577
01:43:59,166 --> 01:44:02,795
<i>looks like a big win for us tonight.</i>
<i>Congratulations, Mr. Milk.</i>

1578
01:44:08,008 --> 01:44:09,771
Yeah, I know,
it's incredible.

1579
01:44:09,843 --> 01:44:13,210
All the precincts have reported
we've won 65% in LA County.

1580
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:14,941
<i>It's huge, Harvey.</i>

1581
01:44:15,015 --> 01:44:16,846
I got to go, Don.

1582
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:21,786
We just took LA County by 65%.
Put it up! Put it up!

1583
01:44:32,165 --> 01:44:33,359
Okay, okay.

1584
01:44:33,433 --> 01:44:35,264
What, Jim? Jim, what?
- Okay, okay!

1585
01:44:35,335 --> 01:44:37,633
The polls were way off.
Briggs is going down by 2 to 1.

1586
01:44:37,704 --> 01:44:41,037
The only place it's going to pass in
San Francisco is Dan White's district.

1587
01:44:42,209 --> 01:44:44,609
Somebody, cover up
Lady Liberty!

1588
01:44:44,678 --> 01:44:47,442
The cameras are
on the way here.

1589
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:35,356
<i>Tonight, it's become clear</i>
<i>to everyone out there</i>

1590
01:45:35,429 --> 01:45:38,455
<i>that they do know one of us,</i>
<i>and now that they do,</i>

1591
01:45:38,532 --> 01:45:40,557
<i>they can see that</i>
<i>we're not sick.</i>

1592
01:45:41,368 --> 01:45:43,836
<i>They can feel that</i>
<i>we are not wrong.</i>

1593
01:45:44,738 --> 01:45:49,300
<i>And they know that there must
be, that there should be a place</i>

1594
01:45:49,376 --> 01:45:54,109
<i>for us in this great</i>
<i>country, in this world.</i>

1595
01:46:00,454 --> 01:46:05,482
A message of hope has been
sent to all those young people,

1596
01:46:05,559 --> 01:46:09,188
to all of those who've been
afraid by this wave of hate,

1597
01:46:09,262 --> 01:46:13,426
to all of those who have lost
their homes, lost their hometowns.

1598
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:19,234
Tonight, we are clear that
there is a place for us!

1599
01:46:19,306 --> 01:46:22,605
My brothers and sisters,
we can come home again!

1600
01:46:47,033 --> 01:46:49,092
Oh, good morning, Dan.

1601
01:46:49,169 --> 01:46:52,297
Morning, Harvey,
I just resigned.

1602
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:56,702
Congratulations. I'm sure you'll
be the next President of the Board.

1603
01:47:00,147 --> 01:47:03,446
Hey, Dan.
Just got word.

1604
01:47:03,517 --> 01:47:05,815
Can we talk to you for a minute?

1605
01:47:06,386 --> 01:47:07,648
Yeah, sure.

1606
01:47:07,721 --> 01:47:10,121
The association
meeting room.

1607
01:47:24,671 --> 01:47:27,799
<i>Well, now it starts all over</i>
<i>again, because this morning,</i>

1608
01:47:27,874 --> 01:47:33,073
<i>former Supervisor Dan White says he wants
to be called supervisor one more time.</i>

1609
01:47:33,146 --> 01:47:37,606
He gets dragged into this closed
door meeting at Police Association.

1610
01:47:37,684 --> 01:47:39,208
Suddenly
he wants his job back.

1611
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:40,878
I mean, who knows what they
might have said to him in there.

1612
01:47:40,954 --> 01:47:42,888
Or what they may
have promised him.

1613
01:47:42,956 --> 01:47:44,446
Or worse yet, if they
had threatened him.

1614
01:47:44,524 --> 01:47:47,015
A man has the right to change
his mind. Give me some peace.

1615
01:47:47,093 --> 01:47:50,620
Dan White has been the vote on the
board that has stood in our way.

1616
01:47:50,697 --> 01:47:52,460
The vote.
- I get it, Harvey.

1617
01:47:52,532 --> 01:47:54,397
I've been lobbied all week.
Enough.

1618
01:47:55,669 --> 01:47:58,866
Let me remind you of something,
you're up for re-election.

1619
01:47:58,939 --> 01:48:02,204
If you reappoint Dan White, you will
lose the gay vote. They listen to me.

1620
01:48:02,275 --> 01:48:04,436
You will not be
elected dog catcher.

1621
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:09,712
I'll make
my decision on Monday.

1622
01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:12,848
You know who you
sounded like just now?

1623
01:48:12,919 --> 01:48:15,854
Boss
Tweed or Mayor Daly.

1624
01:48:18,024 --> 01:48:19,616
I like that.

1625
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:24,889
A homosexual with power.

1626
01:48:26,266 --> 01:48:28,063
That's scary.

1627
01:49:37,203 --> 01:49:38,864
Hello.

1628
01:49:38,939 --> 01:49:40,668
Yes, hold on, please.

1629
01:49:42,709 --> 01:49:44,176
Thank you.

1630
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:46,644
Yes, this is Dan White.

1631
01:49:46,713 --> 01:49:49,273
<i>Hi, Mr. White, this is</i>
<i>Barbara Taylor from KCBS.</i>

1632
01:49:49,349 --> 01:49:50,441
Mmm-hmm.

1633
01:49:50,517 --> 01:49:52,417
<i>I'm interested</i>
<i>in your reaction.</i>

1634
01:49:52,485 --> 01:49:55,215
<i>I've received information</i>
<i>from the mayor's office</i>

1635
01:49:55,288 --> 01:49:58,382
<i>that you're not</i>
<i>getting your job back.</i>

1636
01:50:00,393 --> 01:50:03,294
I'm sorry, I don't know
anything about that.

1637
01:50:21,014 --> 01:50:22,242
Hello?

1638
01:50:22,315 --> 01:50:23,942
<i>Did I wake you?</i>

1639
01:50:25,919 --> 01:50:28,251
Harvey?
Are you all right?

1640
01:50:28,922 --> 01:50:33,188
I went to the opera tonight.
Guess who I went with.

1641
01:50:34,260 --> 01:50:35,352
<i>Who?</i>

1642
01:50:35,428 --> 01:50:37,953
Bidu Sayao herself.

1643
01:50:38,031 --> 01:50:41,432
She was my first Puccini.
The crowd went wild.

1644
01:50:41,501 --> 01:50:45,801
I felt like I was young
again, being at my first opera.

1645
01:50:58,184 --> 01:51:01,051
Maybe you should tell me the
next time you go to the opera.

1646
01:51:02,155 --> 01:51:03,554
Really?

1647
01:51:03,623 --> 01:51:05,921
<i>Yeah. I'd go with you.</i>

1648
01:51:08,995 --> 01:51:10,519
I'd like that.

1649
01:51:26,646 --> 01:51:28,876
Look outside,
the sun's coming up.

1650
01:51:28,948 --> 01:51:30,939
<i>Okay, hang on.</i>

1651
01:51:55,742 --> 01:51:57,300
Hey, wait a minute.

1652
01:51:57,377 --> 01:51:59,504
My aide was supposed
to come down here

1653
01:51:59,579 --> 01:52:01,604
and let me in the side door,
but she never showed up.

1654
01:52:01,681 --> 01:52:04,149
And you are?
- I'm Dan White, City Supervisor.

1655
01:52:12,592 --> 01:52:13,718
Harvey,

1656
01:52:15,662 --> 01:52:18,130
I want you to know
that I am proud of you.

1657
01:52:59,873 --> 01:53:01,773
I don't wanna miss this.

1658
01:53:02,909 --> 01:53:04,536
<i>Miss what?</i>

1659
01:53:07,247 --> 01:53:08,305
This.

1660
01:53:12,886 --> 01:53:16,185
Is he here? Can I see
the mayor for a moment?

1661
01:53:17,390 --> 01:53:19,915
Just a minute,
I'll see if he's available.

1662
01:53:22,328 --> 01:53:24,694
Sir, Dan White
is here to see you.

1663
01:53:29,035 --> 01:53:31,060
So, who are they
gonna replace Dan with?

1664
01:53:31,137 --> 01:53:34,402
That goddamn lefty
liberal, Don Horanzy?

1665
01:53:34,474 --> 01:53:36,305
That'll really
shake up the board.

1666
01:53:36,376 --> 01:53:39,106
All I know is that we're
getting a new supervisor today.

1667
01:53:39,179 --> 01:53:42,342
If Dan shows up,
just avoid him.

1668
01:53:42,415 --> 01:53:44,883
We don't need a scene
today, do we, Harvey?

1669
01:53:45,485 --> 01:53:46,975
God forbid, Dianne.

1670
01:53:49,455 --> 01:53:52,253
Mr. White,
the mayor will see you now.

1671
01:53:55,495 --> 01:53:56,826
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1672
01:53:56,896 --> 01:53:59,228
Dan, come on in.

1673
01:54:01,634 --> 01:54:03,465
It's not something
that I wanna calm down about.

1674
01:54:03,536 --> 01:54:05,299
You can't take
this away from me.

1675
01:54:05,371 --> 01:54:08,272
Dan, look,
you made a decision.

1676
01:54:08,341 --> 01:54:10,332
You know,
you made the decision.

1677
01:54:12,278 --> 01:54:15,873
The issue is what's fair to the
people of your district, Dan.

1678
01:54:15,949 --> 01:54:20,079
Now, look, take some time off.
Spend it with your family.

1679
01:55:06,432 --> 01:55:10,664
Tell President Carter we're
coming after him next, this time next year.

1680
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:11,829
Hi, Dianne.

1681
01:55:11,905 --> 01:55:14,100
We're marching
to Washington D.C.

1682
01:55:17,043 --> 01:55:19,307
Hey, can I see you in
my office for a minute?

1683
01:55:21,681 --> 01:55:25,139
Sure. I'll be back.
Yeah.

1684
01:55:43,636 --> 01:55:44,864
No.

1685
01:56:26,713 --> 01:56:28,874
Well,
you know what I think?

1686
01:56:28,948 --> 01:56:31,678
I think you need
to find a new scene.

1687
01:56:31,751 --> 01:56:33,343
And some new friends.

1688
01:56:35,989 --> 01:56:37,820
I need a change.

1689
01:56:41,194 --> 01:56:43,287
You're 40 now.
- Oh.

1690
01:56:48,167 --> 01:56:53,264
Forty years old and I haven't
done a thing I'm proud of.

1691
01:56:55,141 --> 01:56:59,737
Keep eating all that cake, you're gonna
be a fat-ass by the time you're 50.

1692
01:56:59,812 --> 01:57:02,781
No, I'll never make it to 50.

1693
01:57:48,294 --> 01:57:49,886
Where is everyone?

1694
01:57:50,897 --> 01:57:52,626
Doesn't anyone
give a damn?

1695
01:57:53,566 --> 01:57:56,399
Cleve's getting some people
together in the Castro.

1696
01:58:03,843 --> 01:58:08,405
Last week I got a phone call
from Altoona, Pennsylvania.

1697
01:58:09,515 --> 01:58:15,351
The voice was very young,
and the person said, "Thanks."

1698
01:58:16,689 --> 01:58:21,422
<i>You've got to elect gay people</i>
<i>so that the young child</i>

1699
01:58:22,028 --> 01:58:25,156
<i>and the thousands upon</i>
<i>thousands just like him</i>

1700
01:58:26,065 --> 01:58:28,727
<i>will have hope</i>
<i>for a better life.</i>

1701
01:58:29,869 --> 01:58:32,269
<i>Hope for a better tomorrow.</i>

1702
01:58:49,755 --> 01:58:51,222
<i>I ask this,</i>

1703
01:58:52,758 --> 01:58:55,693
<i>that if there be</i>
<i>an assassination,</i>

1704
01:58:57,330 --> 01:59:03,530
<i>I would want five, ten,</i>
<i>a hundred, a thousand to rise.</i>

1705
01:59:08,274 --> 01:59:12,608
<i>If a bullet should enter my brain,
let it destroy every closet door.</i>

1706
01:59:14,147 --> 01:59:21,349
<i>I ask for the movement to continue
because it's not about personal gain,</i>

1707
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:24,583
<i>and it's not about ego</i>
<i>and it's not about power.</i>

1708
01:59:25,358 --> 01:59:27,883
<i>It's about the</i>
<i>"us's" out there.</i>

1709
01:59:29,262 --> 01:59:33,028
<i>Not just the gays but</i>
<i>the blacks and the Asians</i>

1710
01:59:33,099 --> 01:59:34,999
<i>and the seniors</i>
<i>and the disabled.</i>

1711
01:59:35,067 --> 01:59:36,295
<i>The "us's."</i>

1712
01:59:39,972 --> 01:59:43,339
<i>Without hope,</i>
<i>the "us's" give up.</i>

1713
01:59:45,545 --> 01:59:49,641
<i>And I know you can't</i>
<i>live on hope alone.</i>

1714
01:59:49,715 --> 01:59:54,414
<i>But without hope,</i>
<i>life is not worth living.</i>

1715
01:59:56,789 --> 01:59:58,188
<i>So you,</i>

1716
01:59:59,158 --> 02:00:00,716
<i>and you,</i>

1717
02:00:01,227 --> 02:00:02,592
<i>and you,</i>

1718
02:00:02,962 --> 02:00:04,987
you got to give them hope.

1719
02:00:06,832 --> 02:00:09,323
You got to give them hope.

1720
02:02:09,324 --> 02:02:10,324
