1
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,007
It's time
to get out.

2
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,591
Don't bleed
to death.

3
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,099
- Hello, Mitchell.
- Bond.

4
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,725
The Americans are gonna be
none too pleased about this.

5
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,770
I promised them Le Chiffre,
and they got Le Chiffre.

6
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,270
They got his body.

7
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:57,433
If they'd wanted his soul, they should
have made a deal with a priest.

8
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,909
- Has he said anything?
- No.

9
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,812
I'm going to check the perimeter, ma'am.

10
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,542
You look like hell.

11
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,916
When's the last time you slept?

12
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,886
Vesper's boyfriend, Yusef Kabira,

13
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,222
the one who was abducted in Morocco,
the one she was trying to save.

14
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,625
His body was washed up
on a beach in Ibiza.

15
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,391
We're meant to believe
the fish did that to his face.

16
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,262
His wallet and ID were in his pocket.

17
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,063
- Well, that's convenient.
- Quite.

18
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:27,299
Which is why I did a DNA check on a lock
of his hair found in Vesper's apartment.

19
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,464
It's not him.

20
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,269
A lock of his hair?

21
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,141
I wouldn't have thought
Vesper the sentimental type.

22
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,806
Well, we never really know anyone,
do we?

23
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,644
But I do need to know, Bond.

24
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,647
I need to know that I can trust you.

25
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,581
And you don't?

26
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,022
Well, it'd be a pretty cold bastard

27
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,992
who didn't want revenge
for the death of someone he loved.

28
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,154
You don't have to worry about me.

29
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,495
I'm not gonna go chasing him.
He's not important.

30
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,498
And neither was she.

31
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,836
It's clear, ma'am.

32
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,170
- Thanks, Mitchell.
- Shall we?

33
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,989
Are you gonna tell us who you work for?

34
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,295
I was always very interested to meet you.

35
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,733
I'd heard so much about you from Vesper.

36
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,964
The real shame is that
if she hadn't killed herself,

37
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,974
we would have had you, too.

38
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:39,375
I think you would have done
anything for her.

39
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,970
Well, you know you're not in Britain,
and God knows where you'll be tomorrow.

40
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,482
Which should tell you that eventually

41
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,678
you will tell us about
the people you work with,

42
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:51,348
and the longer it takes,
the more painful we'll make it.

43
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,560
You really don't know anything about us.

44
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:04,200
It's so amusing because
we are on the other side, thinking,

45
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,000
"The Ml6, the CIA,
they're looking over our shoulders.

46
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,870
"They're listening to our conversations."

47
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:12,069
And the truth is
you don't even know we exist.

48
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:15,614
Well, we do now, Mr. White,
and we're quick learners.

49
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,673
Oh, really?

50
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,949
Well, then, the first thing
you should know about us

51
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,545
is that we have people everywhere.

52
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,756
Am I right?

53
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:42,704
Anything?

54
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,200
Craig Mitchell worked for me
for eight years.

55
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,736
He passed a full security check
and lie detector test every year.

56
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,442
Didn't leave so much as a scrap of
paper to explain any of it.

57
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,520
Eight years!
Five as my personal bodyguard.

58
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,919
I found this and three other
bloody Christmas presents

59
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,217
I bought him about the house.

60
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,781
I don't think he smoked.

61
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,860
And you had to kill him.

62
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:06,125
Couldn't bring him in for questioning so
that we might actually learn something.

63
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,394
When someone says we got people everywhere,
you expect it to be hyperbole.

64
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,460
Lots of people say that.
Florists use that expression.

65
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:16,405
Doesn't mean that they've got somebody
working for them inside the bloody room.

66
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,739
What the hell is this organization, Bond?

67
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,440
How can they be everywhere
and we know nothing about them?

68
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,451
- I assume we found no trace of White.
- No.

69
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,814
The agent guarding the door in the garage

70
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,785
was dead before you passed him
on the stairs.

71
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:31,651
I passed him on the stairs? Christ!

72
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,624
Mitchell must have killed him when he
went out to check the perimeter.

73
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,422
You're lucky to be here.

74
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,053
Do you think White's still alive?

75
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,927
- Yes, I do.
- What is it?

76
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,899
Craig Mitchell, 45 years old.

77
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,401
No living family.
Gave generously to charity.

78
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,233
Tell me you know more than that.

79
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,899
Our moneymen went through
every bill in Mitchell's wallet and house.

80
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:52,000
- How much did he have?
- Less than 100 pounds,

81
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:54,079
and about the same in euros and dollars.

82
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,636
Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am.

83
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,013
We've done a complete forensic analysis
of every note and its traceable history.

84
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,779
Not in the mood.

85
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,920
After you.

86
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,691
This particular note from
Mitchell's wallet may be of interest.

87
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:07,816
<i>Scanning.</i>

88
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,918
We introduced tagged bills into
Le Chiffre's money-laundering operation

89
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,157
by intercepting illegal payoffs.

90
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:16,257
We traced money through several of
his bank accounts around the world.

91
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,597
That's pretty thin.

92
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:18,863
At the rate money changes hands,

93
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,098
you could probably find a tenner
in my wallet with a tag.

94
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,266
That's true, ma'am.
A single bill could be a coincidence,

95
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,105
but what about a whole stack?

96
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,441
These bills,
from the same series as Mitchell's,

97
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,505
were just scanned at a bank
in Port-au-Prince, Haiti,

98
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,483
deposited in the account of a Mr. Slate.

99
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,179
Impress me.

100
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,346
We have a Mr. Edmund Slate
returning to Port-au-Prince

101
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,549
from Heathrow this morning.

102
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:43,389
His entry documents have him staying
at the Hotel Dessalines.

103
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,326
He's in room 325.

104
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

105
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,638
Do you have any messages for 325?

106
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,969
No, sir.
The only message was about the briefcase

107
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,534
that was delivered earlier.

108
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:16,478
- Did you want us to continue holding it?
- No. No, I'll take that now.

109
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,845
Yes, sir.

110
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,848
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

111
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:32,691
Get in!

112
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,959
- What?
- Get in.

113
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:38,997
All right.

114
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,700
You're late.

115
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,834
I got pulled into a meeting.

116
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,344
Who with?

117
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,505
A friend of Mr. White's.

118
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,376
Don't think I know him.

119
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,314
It's funny.

120
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,357
You don't look at all like I expected.

121
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,659
Really? What were you expecting?

122
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,195
I didn't think geologists looked so...

123
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,423
So?

124
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,725
A friend of yours?

125
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,861
I don't have any friends.

126
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,176
Get out of the way! Move!

127
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,959
We didn't settle on a price.

128
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,722
Make me an offer.

129
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,459
We can work it out later, over drinks.

130
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,731
Dominic didn't give you any trouble,
did he?

131
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,067
No.

132
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,444
What the hell is this?

133
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,037
I think someone wants to kill you.

134
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,121
That wasn't very nice.

135
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,423
- You were supposed to shoot her.
- Well, I missed.

136
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,472
Get Bond.

137
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:28,109
- Where is he now?
- Approaching the docks, Kings Quay.

138
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,111
<i>- Connecting.</i>
<i>- Tanner.</i>

139
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,243
I've got Bond.

140
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,445
Ask him about Slate.

141
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,147
<i>She wants to know about Slate.</i>

142
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,813
Tell her Slate was a dead end.

143
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:39,982
Slate was a dead end.

144
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,320
<i>Connection terminated.</i>

145
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,121
Damn him. He killed him.

146
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,162
Touch me and I'll break your wrist.

147
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,805
Camille.

148
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,675
How nice to see you.

149
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,873
Alive, you mean?

150
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:40,208
I knew we shouldn't have slept together.

151
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:42,718
I think I'm starting to like you.

152
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:45,585
So you did just try and have me killed.

153
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:50,484
And that made me very sad
thinking I would never see you again.

154
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,193
But here you are.

155
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,098
Damn it, Dominic!
I was trying to help you.

156
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,038
I was trying to uncover a leak.

157
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,268
And you, you sent someone to kill me?

158
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:07,243
Please don't talk to me like I'm stupid!

159
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,541
It's unattractive.

160
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,613
Come. I wanna show you something.

161
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:18,882
Come.

162
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,619
There's nothing that makes me
more uncomfortable

163
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:24,126
than friends talking behind my back.

164
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,890
It feels like

165
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,699
ants under my skin.

166
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,102
It's been that way forever.

167
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,229
I remember when I was 15,

168
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:38,365
I had a crush on
one of my mother's piano students.

169
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:43,741
Somehow I overheard her saying
very nasty things about me.

170
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,746
I got so angry.

171
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,715
I took an iron.

172
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,557
Is that him?

173
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,895
I... We only spoke on the phone.

174
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,128
It's such a shame
because he's one of my best geologists.

175
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,570
He said you asked to buy information.

176
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,972
No. He called me
and offered to sell me information.

177
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,980
Why would I come back here
if I was lying?

178
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,249
Because you love me.

179
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,444
I was doing it for you.

180
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,954
To stop him from betraying you.

181
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:29,093
You know what burns more
than all your bullshit?

182
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:33,364
Is that I always got the feeling
that you were only sleeping with me

183
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,626
to get to General Medrano.

184
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,294
Is that him?

185
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:43,198
You know how these
deposed dictators are,

186
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,333
jealous of their safety.

187
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,870
Stick around.

188
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,445
I'll introduce you.

189
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,112
Do you see the girl
that just walked in here?

190
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:58,280
Could you give her that?
Tell her to call me.

191
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:21,001
<i>You've reached Universal Exports.</i>
<i>Our offices are currently closed.</i>

192
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,153
And you can do all this for me?

193
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,149
Well, look at what we
did to this country.

194
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,659
The Haitians elect a priest

195
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:41,358
who decides to raise the minimum wage
from 38 cents to $1 a day.

196
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,036
It's not a lot,
but it's enough to upset the corporations

197
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,561
who were here making T-shirts
and running shoes.

198
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:52,734
So they called us,
and we facilitated a change.

199
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:53,902
The difference is,

200
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:58,176
my country's not some flyspeck
in the middle of the Caribbean.

201
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,685
But we've already begun
destabilizing the government.

202
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:04,187
We'll supply the private security.

203
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,416
We'll pay off the right officials,

204
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:10,460
and we have 26 countries
ready to officially recognize

205
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:13,030
your new Bolivian government.

206
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,262
You want your country back.

207
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,968
My organization can give it to you
within the week.

208
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,701
You've been busy.

209
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:26,543
And in return you want what?

210
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,111
A desert.

211
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,781
- This part.
- This land is worthless.

212
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,784
So you're getting a great deal.

213
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,828
You won't find oil there.

214
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,954
Everyone has tried.

215
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,397
Maybe, maybe not.

216
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,236
But we own whatever we find.

217
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:03,612
Did you know Ernesto Montes?

218
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,116
A very powerful man in his day.

219
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,652
He had a beautiful Russian wife.

220
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:10,918
A dancer.

221
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,190
Well, his daughter works for me.

222
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,090
Or did.

223
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,251
She's lovely,

224
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,924
but I don't see the resemblance.

225
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:24,799
Why don't you consider her
as something to sweeten the deal?

226
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,642
Just promise me to drop her
over the side when you're done.

227
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,940
Camille, General Medrano.

228
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,560
Be careful what you wish for, my dear.

229
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,070
Have fun, you two.

230
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,279
What the hell are you doing?

231
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,415
- You're welcome!
- You idiot! Take me back!

232
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,086
You know, maybe I'll do that later.

233
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,759
You're not one of Greene's.

234
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,493
Dominic Greene?

235
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,404
Get down!

236
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,496
- Give me the wheel!
- Navigate!

237
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:17,700
Left!

238
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,950
- What are you doing?
- Hold on!

239
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,136
Get down!

240
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,410
Excuse me.

241
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,649
Thank you. She's seasick.

242
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:46,689
It's Bond.

243
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,850
- Connect Bond.
<i>- Connecting 007.</i>

244
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,984
Yes?

245
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,255
Name check, Dominic Greene.

246
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,127
<i>G- R-E-E-N-E.</i>

247
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:57,792
I might need a little more than that.

248
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,927
There are a lot of Dominic Greenes.

249
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,994
Do you have a social security
or passport number?

250
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,367
No.

251
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:03,804
<i>Scanning DGSE databases.</i>

252
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,844
<i>- Anything?</i>
<i>- Scanning KGB databases.</i>

253
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,139
Do you have anything?
Will you put her on, please?

254
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,807
I am on, Bond. What happened to Slate?

255
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,111
I'm not dwelling on the past.

256
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,311
- I don't think you should, either.
- You killed him.

257
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,378
Largest hit, Dominic Greene,
CEO of Greene Planet.

258
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,354
It's a utility company,

259
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,893
but Greene's been doing
a lot of philanthropic work,

260
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,724
buying up large tracts of land
for ecological preserves.

261
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,822
<i>You should be getting
his picture now.</i>

262
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,527
Yep, that's him.

263
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,264
I'm afraid there's a firewall
around his other corporate holdings,

264
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,565
so we have no other information.

265
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,105
Get me the Americans.

266
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:37,606
<i>Connecting.</i>

267
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:38,732
<i>Go ahead.</i>

268
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:41,505
Interest in Dominic Greene,
Greene Planet.

269
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,342
<i>Transferring you now.</i>

270
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,513
<i>Hold for Gregory Beam, please.</i>

271
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,443
<i>Thank you.</i>

272
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,454
<i>Hi, this is Gregory Beam, ma 'am.</i>

273
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,183
Hello, Mr. Beam.

274
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,852
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.
We have no interest in Mr. Greene.

275
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,361
Thank you, Mr. Beam.

276
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,521
<i>Connection terminated.</i>

277
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,360
He's a person of extreme interest.

278
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,866
- But he just said that he wasn't...
- Tanner, I asked about the man

279
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,563
and she transferred me
to the section chief of South America.

280
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,867
How would she know to do that
if they weren't tracking him?

281
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,646
<i>Bond, we have your location</i>
<i>as approaching an airfield.</i>

282
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,578
<i>- Is Greene on the move?</i>
- Yeah.

283
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,880
I've got a tail number,
Golf-Zero-Charlie-Sierra-Charlie.

284
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,977
<i>Get me a destination.</i>

285
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,214
It's a private charter

286
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,386
going to Bregenz, Austria,
leaving immediately.

287
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,557
Tanner, authorize a charter for 007.

288
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,163
And, Bond, if you could avoid killing
every possible lead,

289
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,464
it would be deeply appreciated.

290
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,235
Yes, ma'am. I'll do my best.

291
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,401
<i>Connection terminated.</i>

292
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,738
I've heard that before.

293
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,111
- Hello.
- Hi.

294
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,174
Welcome aboard.

295
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,183
Come. Have a seat.

296
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:01,016
Charlie-Sierra-Charlie.

297
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,434
Jeez.

298
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,273
Sorry.

299
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,812
How much longer?

300
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,043
So do we have an understanding?

301
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:31,178
Yeah.

302
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,655
We do nothing to stop a coup in Bolivia,
and in exchange,

303
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:38,218
the new government gives America
the lease to any oil found.

304
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,655
If it's oil you want.

305
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,567
Well, you didn't find diamonds, did you?

306
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:54,636
Drilling underground, you kept off
everybody's radar for a very long time,

307
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:58,876
but you can't buy that much piping
without somebody getting curious.

308
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,975
We'll have to verify the find.

309
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:06,490
I'm not even admitting there is one.
You are getting this for free.

310
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:10,324
Venezuela, Brazil, now Bolivia.

311
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:15,058
With you tied up in the Middle East,
South America is falling like dominoes.

312
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,335
You don't need another Marxist giving
national resources to the people, do you?

313
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,031
Well, we can hardly be expected
to do something about a coup

314
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:26,042
we know nothing about.

315
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:31,674
And I have a pest.

316
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,511
This.

317
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,190
You have any idea who that is?

318
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,599
Sorry.

319
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,768
It's James Bond, British Secret Service.

320
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:00,643
I don't know how I
could have missed that.

321
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,977
I will need you to get rid of him for me.

322
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:07,710
Yeah. That's not gonna be a problem.

323
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,663
You know who Greene is
and you wanna put us in bed with him.

324
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,739
You are kidding, right?

325
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:32,139
Yeah. You're right.
We should just deal with nice people.

326
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,939
I need to know you're on the team, Felix.

327
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:37,606
I need to know you value your career.

328
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,848
Dominic Greene.

329
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,371
- Good to see you. Good.
- How are you?

330
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:13,876

331
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,804

335
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,400
<i>Anything further</i>

00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,561
<i>We'll discuss that later.</i>

337
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,437
<i>How much more pipeline do we need?</i>

338
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,066
Ideally, 2,000 kilometers.

00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,603
<i>Are there any objections?</i>

340
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:30,771
<i>No.</i>

<i>Not here.</i>

342

<i>No objections.</i>

Transfer the funds

00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:38,885
<i>Done.</i>

345

Where do the Americans stand?

346
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:48,897
Well, the CIA doesn't care about another
dictator as long as they get their end.

347
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:51,526
But when they find out
that they've been duped?

348
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,570
I'm working on that.

349
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:57,266
<i>I'm still not sure that the Tierra Project</i>
<i>is the best use of Quantum 's time.</i>

350
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:59,740
<i>Perhaps we should shift</i>
<i>our focus to the Canadian.</i>

351
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,540
<i>This is the world's</i>
<i>most precious resource.</i>

352
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:05,878
<i>We need to control as much</i>
<i>of it as we can.</i>

353
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,214
Bolivia must be top priority.

354
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:10,219
Can I offer an opinion?

355
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:16,458
I really think you people
should find a better place to meet.

356
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,659
Where do you think you're going?

357
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:46,914
Thank you.

358
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,268
Well, <i>Tosca</i> isn't for everyone.

359
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,676
Drop it.

360
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,513
So who are you working for?

361
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:21,846
Piss off.

362
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:26,213
Get rid of anything we brought with us.
We've been compromised.

363
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,922
I asked you who you were working for.

364
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:46,274
- Is he one of ours?
- No.

365
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,936
Then he shouldn't be looking at me.

366
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,078
Get me M.

367
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:01,888
It's your line.

368
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:04,393
Thanks. Connect call.

369
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:05,928
<i>Connecting Tanner.</i>

370
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,463
<i>We've ID'd the pictures.</i>

371
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:08,826
Show me.

372
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:13,596
Gregor Karakov, former minister,
now owns most of the mines in Siberia,

373
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:17,333
<i>Moishe Soref, former Mossad,</i>
<i>now telecom giant,</i>

374
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,239
<i>and Guy Haines, special envoy</i>
<i>to the Prime Minister.</i>

375
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,572
Get Bond.

376
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:23,408
There's something else.

377
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,576
<i>It appears Bond shot Haines'
bodyguard and threw him off a roof.</i>

378
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,419
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- Did you get my pictures?

379
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,788
Was this a conversation?
Can you link these people?

380
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:37,258
<i>Is that stress in your voice?</i>

381
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:38,851
I need you to come in and debrief.

382
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,125
- I don't have time.
<i>- Bond, you killed a man in Bregenz.</i>

383
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:43,427
I did my best not to.

384
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,365
<i>You shot him at point blank</i>
<i>and threw him off a roof.</i>

385
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,437
I'd hardly call that showing restraint,

386
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,335
especially since he was
a member of Special Branch.

387
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,637
So who was he guarding?

388
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:55,769
Bond, are you missing the fact

389
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,336
that you killed a member
of Special Branch?

390
00:46:57,447 --> 00:46:59,381
I need you to come in.

391
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:03,613
And I would, but right now I need to find
the man who tried to kill you.

392
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:04,847
<i>Go back to sleep.</i>

393
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:06,217
<i>Connection terminated.</i>

394
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,722
Restrict Bond's movements.

395
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,452
Cancel his cards.

396
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:11,289
Put an alert on his passports.
All of them.

397
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:13,625
And I want to know everything
we don't know about Haines.

398
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:14,721
<i>Yes, ma 'am.</i>

399
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,960
And, Tanner,
be careful who you trust with this.

400
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:20,401
Hopefully, you're a better judge
of character than I am.

401
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,473
You want to follow your friends
to La Paz, Bolivia?

402
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:25,803
Please.

403
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:29,804
I'm sorry, sir, but this doesn't work.

404
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,212
Do you have another card?

405
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:33,476
No.

406
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,880
Could you do me a favor?

407
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,822
You're gonna get a
phone call in a minute.

408
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:46,329
Would you mind telling them
I'm headed for Cairo?

409
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:48,762
- I'd be happy to.
- Thank you.

410
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,103
Mathis.

411
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,773
What do you want?

412
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:34,537
Come to apologize?

413
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,710
You know, Mathis,

414
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,479
I think retirement suits you.

415
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,776
None for him.

416
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:46,652
Sorry. He's in a bad mood today.

417
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,410
I need a passport
and matching credit cards.

418
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:15,512
And Ml6 ran out of plastic?

419
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,582
Well, oddly, right now,
you're the only person I think I can trust.

420
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:21,351
That is odd.

421
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,289
But I guess when one's young,

422
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,091
it seems very easy to distinguish
between right and wrong.

423
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:30,133
But as one gets older,
it becomes more difficult.

424
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,192
The villains and the heroes
get all mixed up.

425
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:36,605
I was sorry to hear about Vesper.

426
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,972
I think she loved you.

427
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,442
Right up until the moment
she betrayed me.

428
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:45,008
She died for you.

429
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,483
Why did you really want to see me?

430
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:53,055
I need some information.

431
00:49:57,194 --> 00:50:01,460
You have some hard friends.
This man is some kind of facilitator.

432
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:04,898
Fingers in many pies,
and they don't leave any prints.

433
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:08,631
- These men were together?
- They're buying up oil pipeline.

434
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:10,195
Something called the Tierra Project.

435
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,673
- Do you know it?
- Destroy these.

436
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,143
That's Guy Haines. You don't know him?

437
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,146
- Should I?
- I suppose not.

438
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:20,274
You haven't been keeping
secrets as long as I have.

439
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,352
He keeps a very low profile,

440
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:26,082
but he's one of the Prime Minister's
closest advisors.

441
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,750
Well, they say you're judged
by the strength of your enemies.

442
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,953
Do you know anything about Bolivia?

443
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:35,259
I was stationed in South America
for seven years.

444
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,198
- Well, do you have some contacts there?
- A few.

445
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,762
What do you want to know?

446
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:43,105
Come with me.

447
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:15,600
You can't sleep?

448
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,004
May I fix you a drink, sir?

449
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,008
What are you drinking?

450
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,802
I don't know. What am I drinking?

451
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,349
Three measures of Gordon's gin,
one of vodka, half of...

452
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,476
- Kina Lillet.
- Kina Lillet, which is not Vermouth,

453
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,281
shaken well until it is ice-cold,

454
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:34,653
then served
with a large thin slice of lemon peel.

455
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:36,682
Six of them.

456
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:38,688
That's impressive.

457
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:41,195
They're good. You should have one.

458
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:43,789
No, it'll just keep me awake.

459
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,537
So what's keeping you awake?

460
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,938
I was wondering why you came with me.

461
00:51:57,547 --> 00:52:00,778
It takes something
to admit you were wrong.

462
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,153
- You want a sleeping pill?
- No.

463
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:07,850
- Pain pill?
- No.

464
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,051
I have pills for everything.

465
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,528
Some make you taller.

466
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,495
Some make you forget.

467
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,236
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

468
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:22,669
Good idea.

469
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,053
Thank you.

470
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:42,515
Mr. Bond, my name is Fields.
I'm from the consulate.

471
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:43,650
Well, of course you are.

472
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,024
And what do you do
at the consulate, Fields?

473
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:46,392
That's not important.

474
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,724
My orders are to turn you around

475
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,856
and put you on the first plane
back to London.

476
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,697
Do those orders include my friend Mathis?

477
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:54,498
I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.

478
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:57,734
You see that? Gone such a short time
and already forgotten.

479
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,502
You're just saying that to hurt me.

480
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:02,737
Mr. Bond, these orders come from
the highest possible authority.

481
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,781
Taxi.
Fields, when is the next flight to London?

482
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:07,281
Tomorrow morning.

483
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:08,408
Well then, we have all night.

484
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,042
If you attempt to flee,
I will arrest you,

485
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,588
drop you off in jail
and take you to the plane in chains.

486
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,180
- Understand?
- Perfectly. After you.

487
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,027
- I think she has handcuffs.
- I do hope so.

488
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:30,636
He blames the water shortage
on global warming.

489
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:33,034
Hello, Carlos? Carlos.

490
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,372
The Colonel who heads
the National Police.

491
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,732
We have a reservation.

492
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,067
<i>- Cómo está?</i>
- Very well, thank you.

493
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,511
- Your name?
- Miss Fields.

494
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,153
- You're going nowhere.
- So shoot me.

495
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,279
I'd rather stay in a morgue.

496
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:22,587
We are teachers on sabbatical.
This fits our cover.

497
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:25,423
No, it doesn't. Get in. Get in!

498
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,482
Follow me, please.

499
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,691
- May I show you your room, <i>señor?</i>
- No, it's fine. Thank you.

500
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,812
I can't find the...

501
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:26,214
The stationery.

502
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,285
Will you come and help me look?

503
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,735
You've been invited to a party.

504
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:48,436
I didn't know we had any friends here.

505
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,002
Greene Planet.

506
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:53,239
You're not coming?

507
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,511
I'm having a drink
with my friend the Colonel.

508
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:57,917
I'll see you there later.

509
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:05,555
Do you know how angry I am at myself?

510
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:07,859
I can't imagine.

511
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,467
You must be furious.

512
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,272
Do you want to go to a party?

513
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:23,139
A party?

514
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,107
But I have nothing to wear.

515
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:27,573
We'll fix that.

516
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,569
It might be useful to
know your real name.

517
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,072
Fields.

518
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,166
Just Fields.

519
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:57,806
Fields it is, then.

520
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:01,680
<i>We are in a spiral</i>
<i>of environmental decline.</i>

521
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:08,918
<i>Since 1945, 17% of the
planet's vegetated surface</i>

522
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:11,859
<i>has been irreversibly degraded.</i>

523
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:18,033
<i>The Tierra Project is just one small part</i>

00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:24,673
<i>to rejuvenate a world</i>
<i>on the verge of collapse.</i>

526
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:30,607
<i>I hope that tonight you make
the decision to be part of that.</i>

527
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:33,980
<i>Thank you.</i>

528
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,778
<i>And have fun.</i>

529
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:42,518
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

530
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,318
Excellent speech and congratulations.

531
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:47,522
Wonderful speech, Dominic.

532
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,530
- We need you here.
- Thank you.

533
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,897
Miss Fields, Mr. Bond, my friend Carlos.

534
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,833
- Pleased to meet you.
- Ma'am.

535
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:58,897
Mr. Bond, Mathis has spoken
a great deal about you.

536
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:02,876
I want you to know my entire
police force is at your disposal.

537
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:04,679
Well, that could be very useful.

538
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:08,012
You know, there are people in this
country spending half their paycheck

539
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:09,574
just to get clean water.

540
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:10,710
What do you think of that?

541
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,879
The Bolivian government is the problem.

542
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,581
They cut down the trees,

543
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:18,855
then act surprised when the water
and the soil wash out to sea.

544
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:22,420
I couldn't agree more.
I hope this figure is to your liking.

545
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:24,898
<i>Chéri,</i> you shouldn't tease.

546
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:29,028
Why don't you tell them about all
the land you bought up outside Potosí?

547
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:31,335
It's been a pleasure. Will you excuse me?

548
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:32,738
Of course.

549
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:33,934
Somehow the logging rights

550
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:38,173
went to a multinational corporation
that cut down the forests,

551
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:42,947
but only after our last government
sold the land to Greene Planet.

552
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:48,289
- Or have I got my facts crossed?
- Yes, I think you did.

553
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:50,958
You'll excuse us?

554
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,696
What a wonderful night.

555
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:59,594
You just cost me
quite a bit of money, darling.

556
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,364
You can't put a price on integrity.

557
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:03,803
I can try.

558
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,877
Thank you.

559
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:14,906
Tell me you didn't drop by tonight
just to piss on my parade.

560
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:18,920
Or are you still after
this General's head for your mantel?

561
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:20,512
A little of both.

562
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,080
Tell me where Medrano is

563
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:25,251
and maybe you won't lose
any more investors.

564
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:33,234
You are really breaking my heart,
choosing an insect like that over me.

565
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:36,534
Are you going to throw me over?

566
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:39,871
No. You've been drinking,
so maybe you slipped.

567
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,201
Just think how much you'd miss me.

568
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,141
Good evening.

569
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,777
There you are.

570
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:55,624
Would you excuse me?

571
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:57,056
Mr. Bond.

572
00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:59,722
What a pleasure.

573
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:04,059
Well, careful with this one.
She won't go to bed with you

574
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:06,829
unless you give her something
she really wants.

575
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:09,063
It's a shame
because she's really quite stunning

576
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:11,971
once you get her on her back.

577
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:14,737
I wish I could say
the feeling was mutual.

578
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:16,108
I'm sorry, Mr. Greene, but we have to go.

579
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:18,477
Please. My friends call me Dominic.

580
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:20,242
I'm sure they do.

581
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,741
How much do you know
about Bond, Camille?

582
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:26,084
Because he's rather a tragic case.

583
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:29,090
As Ml6 says, he's difficult to control.

584
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:33,822
Nice way of saying that everything
he touches seems to wither and die.

585
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,124
Shall we?

586
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:37,758
Doesn't bode well for you, I'm afraid.

587
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,927
You two do make
a charming couple, though.

588
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:42,938
You're both... What's the expression?

589
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,598
Damaged goods.

590
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,511
Oh, my gosh!

591
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,004
I'm so sorry.

592
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:56,945
Come on, lighten up.

593
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,011
You're cramping my style.

594
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,957
So it's British intelligence now.

595
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:03,617
What the hell do you want from me?

596
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:06,457
You're gonna show me
Dominic Greene's Tierra Project.

597
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:08,554
- Are you up to it?
- Do I have a choice?

598
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,462
Do you want one?

599
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:13,400
There's something horribly
efficient about you.

600
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,300
Is that a compliment?

601
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:33,020
Well, what's the bet that Dominic Greene
has friends in the police force?

602
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:45,691
Stay here.

603
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:09,217
Now, why would you want me to do that?

604
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:42,054
Mathis?

605
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,986
There's a hospital
on the other side of town.

606
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,427
Please.

607
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:51,228
Stay with me.

608
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:53,564
Stay here, please.

609
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:55,734
Please.

610
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,504
Come here.

611
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:02,309
It's okay.

612
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:05,771
That's better.

613
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:07,845
That doesn't hurt.

614
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:13,080
Is Mathis your cover name?

615
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,317
Yes.

616
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,587
Not a very good one, is it?

617
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,463
Do we forgive each other?

618
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,274
I shouldn't have left you alone.

619
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:35,174
Vesper.

620
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,606
She gave everything for you.

621
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:42,349
Forgive her.

622
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,284
Forgive yourself.

623
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:10,134
Is that how you treat your friends?

624
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:13,242
He wouldn't care.

625
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:20,853
Let's go.

626
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:38,073
<i>The Foreign Secretary's
asking to see you.</i>

627
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,039
What don't I know?

628
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:43,101
<i>René Mathis has been
shot dead in Bolivia.</i>

629
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,945
<i>The police claim it was Bond.</i>

630
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:21,511
<i>How much did you pay him?</i>

631
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,917
<i>Well, he wanted you,</i>
<i>but I left him the car as collateral.</i>

632
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,922
<i>He'll make much more</i>
<i>when he sells us out.</i>

633
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:31,854
<i>Right.</i>

634
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:34,719
<i>Let's see if this thing'll fly.</i>

635
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:50,939
<i>Here.</i>

636
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:54,539
<i>All the information I found said</i>
<i>there was nothing of value there,</i>

637
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:57,780
<i>but Greene's geologist</i>
<i>had proof that there was.</i>

638
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:04,593
<i>My sources tell me</i>
<i>you're Bolivian Secret Service,</i>

639
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,289
<i>or used to be,</i>

640
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:11,631
<i>and that you infiltrated Greene's</i>
<i>organization by having sex with him.</i>

641
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:15,560
<i>- That offends you?</i>
<i>- No, not in the slightest.</i>

642
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,236
<i>So what's your interest in Greene?</i>

643
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:21,333
<i>Amongst other things,</i>
<i>he tried to kill a friend of mine.</i>

644
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:22,911
<i>- A woman?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

645
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:24,904
<i>But it's not what you think.</i>

646
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,814
<i>- Your mother?</i>
<i>- She likes to think so.</i>

647
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,679
<i>What's that down there?</i>

648
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:37,921
<i>That's a sinkhole.</i>

649
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,189
<i>There are a few around here.</i>

650
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:44,528
<i>Just for the record,</i>
<i>I wasn't with Greene for my...</i>

651
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:20,999
Damn it!

652
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,230
I think we lost him!

653
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,339
He's coming fast!

654
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,317
He's right behind you!

655
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,161
Here. Put that on!

656
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,481
Come on!

657
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:44,903
Camille!

658
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:06,593
According to the Bolivians,
it was a routine stop,

659
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:09,493
and when they discovered Mathis' body,
Bond disarmed and shot them.

660
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:11,859
Of course, there are no witnesses
to prove otherwise.

661
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:14,732
I need something.
I can't go in there unarmed.

662
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:16,930
I'm sorry. There's nothing.

663
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:20,706
Come in.

664
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,569
What's today's excuse?
That Bond is legally blind?

665
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:26,841
No, Minister.

666
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:29,713
I don't think I need to tell you
how upset the PM is.

667
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:32,680
With respect, the PM has my direct line.

668
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:36,282
And he'd have used it
if he'd wanted to speak to you.

669
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:38,860
I'm sorry, M. Things have changed.

670
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:42,123
We've had long discussions
with our cousins.

671
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:44,426
Mr. Greene's interests
and ours now align.

672
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:48,970
Minister, this man is a major player in one
of the most dangerous organizations...

673
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:50,936
We've never even heard of.

674
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,373
Foreign policy cannot be conducted on
the basis of hunches and innuendo.

675
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:56,638
Then give us time
to gather enough evidence

676
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:58,713
so you can make informed decisions.

677
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:00,078
Fine.

678
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:04,309
Say you're right.
Say Greene is a villain.

679
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:08,914
If we refused to do business with villains,
we'd have almost no one to trade with.

680
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:12,154
The world's running out of oil, M.
The Russians aren't playing ball.

681
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:14,559
The Americans and Chinese
are dividing up what's left.

682
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:17,098
Right or wrong doesn't come into it.

683
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,566
We're acting out of necessity.

684
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:24,803
Bond is running wild.

685
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:28,770
Who's to say he hasn't been turned?

686
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:32,746
Pull him in
or the Americans will put him down.

687
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:38,011
I think I found a way out.

688
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,917
You're freezing.

689
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:42,985
I'm fine.

690
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:02,543
So what is it that Greene has
that you want?

691
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:11,176
It's not Greene.
It's Medrano, the man he met in Haiti.

692
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:16,222
My father worked for the military junta.

693
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:18,816
He was a very cruel man,

694
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:22,529
but he was my father.

695
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,294
When I was a small child

696
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:31,533
the opposition sent <i>general</i>
Medrano to our house.

697
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:35,707
He shot my father.

698
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:39,411
He did things to my mother and my sister

699
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:43,249
and then strangled them while I watched.

700
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,882
I was too young to be any trouble,

701
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:51,317
so he just smiled at me

702
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:55,923
and set the house on fire.

703
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:00,328
He left his mark.

704
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:05,866
So when I pulled you off the boat...

705
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:08,341
I waited years for that chance.

706
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,170
I apologize.

707
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:17,015
It seems we're both using Greene
to get to somebody.

708
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:19,850
You lost somebody?

709
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:21,754
I did, yes.

710
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:24,783
You catch whoever did it?

711
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,194
No. Not yet.

712
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:30,560
Tell me when you do.

713
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:33,799
I'd like to know how it feels.

714
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,566
We should go.

715
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,405
You ready?

716
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:18,504
They used dynamite.

717
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:23,748
This used to be a riverbed.

718
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:43,867
Greene isn't after the oil.
He wants the water.

719
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:46,765
We can't leave it like this.

720
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:50,869
It's one dam. He's creating a drought.
He'll have built others.

721
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:23,267
Excuse me, sir. Your wife left a message.

722
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:26,398
The English woman,
she left it for you this morning.

723
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:27,873
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

724
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:31,776
What is it?

725
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:35,549
Would you mind waiting down here?

726
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:38,049
I'll be outside.

727
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:58,897
So that's what she meant.

728
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:00,740
I hope you can trust these men.

729
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:03,243
Just a moment. It's Tanner.

730
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:05,406
Yes?

731
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:07,880
We've got the girl downstairs.

732
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:10,144
She says to tell you she's sorry
but this is not her fight.

733
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:11,879
It isn't. Let her go.

734
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,887
She isn't our concern.

735
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:16,218
Well, I'm disappointed.

736
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:17,782
You are?

737
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:19,986
How much oil
did the Americans promise you?

738
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:21,153
This isn't about oil.

739
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:24,426
- Well, that's good, because there isn't any.
- It's about trust.

740
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:26,330
You said you weren't motivated
by revenge.

741
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:28,926
- I'm motivated by my duty.
- No.

742
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:32,930
I think you are so blinded
by inconsolable rage

743
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:35,408
that you don't care who you hurt.

744
01:18:35,477 --> 01:18:39,675
When you can't tell your friends
from your enemies, it's time to go.

745
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:49,988
You might like to tell her your theory
about there being no oil.

746
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:52,185
Her lungs are full of it.

747
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:56,120
- It was Greene.
- No doubt. But why?

748
01:18:57,632 --> 01:19:00,795
- It's just misdirection.
- I mean, why her, Bond?

749
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:05,932
She was just supposed to send you home.
She worked in an office, collecting reports.

750
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:09,137
Look how well your charm works, James.

751
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:12,277
They'll do anything for you, won't they?

752
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:14,482
How many is that now?

753
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:18,952
You're removed from duty and suspended
pending further investigation.

754
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:23,650
You'll give whatever weapons you have
to these men and leave with them now.

755
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:10,594
Miss Fields showed true bravery.

756
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:12,605
I want that mentioned in your report.

757
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:15,676
- Now you and I need to see this through.
- There's nowhere to go.

758
01:20:15,744 --> 01:20:18,713
There's a capture or
kill order out on you.

759
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:21,507
Who would have done that?

760
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:32,258
- Ma'am?
- Find out where he's going.

761
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,351
- He's on to something.
- Ma'am, the CIA is insisting...

762
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:36,954
I could give a shit about the CIA
or their trumped-up evidence.

763
01:20:37,065 --> 01:20:40,057
He's my agent, and I trust him. Go on.

764
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,210
- Get in.
- Are you gonna try and shoot me?

765
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:56,875
I said, get in.

766
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:14,059
You're gonna get botulism
if you keep drinking that.

767
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:16,000
It's bottled water.

768
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:19,802
It probably came from some stream
just around the corner from here.

769
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:22,433
Bunch of little kids peeing in it.

770
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:25,079
That's why I eat the peppers.

771
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:30,243
Well, all I'm saying is
you can't trust a damn thing around here.

772
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:38,991
You know,
you should just answer, "CIA," Felix.

773
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:41,392
A taxi driver told me
where the office was.

774
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:45,661
Well, if we're so easy to find, James,
you really should come visit.

775
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:50,397
Or maybe you should come out
and see some more of the city.

776
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:12,292
I heard a rumor you'd gone native.

777
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,622
Felix.

778
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,030
You know, I was just wondering
what South America would look like

779
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:23,297
if nobody gave a damn
about coke or communism.

780
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:25,965
It's always impressed me the way
you boys have carved this place up.

781
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:29,169
I'll take that as a compliment
coming from a Brit.

782
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:33,806
Are you sure you're playing
with the right side?

783
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:35,816
Regimes change once a week down here.

784
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:37,784
Medrano'll be no dirtier
than the next guy.

785
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:39,877
Oh, you see, that's what I
like about U.S. intelligence.

786
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:41,387
You'll lie down with anybody.

787
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:43,889
Including you, brother. Including you.

788
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:46,392
Do you know you're being played?

789
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:48,223
Dominic Greene's gonna
suck this place dry,

790
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:49,797
and then he's gonna move on,
and you're gonna be left

791
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:51,126
picking up the broken crockery.

792
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:54,066
What can I tell you?
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

793
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:56,069
Well, you see, Felix,
I don't think you're half as cynical

794
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:57,297
as you make out to be.

795
01:22:57,372 --> 01:22:59,169
You don't know me.

796
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:04,543
Why? Just because you didn't come alone?

797
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:07,648
- How long have I got?
- Thirty seconds.

798
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:12,816
Well, that doesn't give us
a lot of time, does it?

799
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:17,382
Medrano can't move until he pays off
the army and the police chief.

800
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,084
<i>Greene's bringing
him his money now.</i>

801
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:21,560
A hotel called La Perla de las Dunas

802
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,187
in the desert.

803
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:25,359
Thank you, Felix.

804
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:27,526
James, move your ass.

805
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:30,364
Get down! Get down, now!

806
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,187
Move it! Move it!

807
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:56,224
What the hell happened?
What did you tell him?

808
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:58,265
Just what we agreed.

809
01:25:22,183 --> 01:25:24,014
What are you doing?

810
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:27,685
The slide's caught.

811
01:25:28,656 --> 01:25:30,954
Maybe you should check your own.

812
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:32,617
I will.

813
01:25:37,398 --> 01:25:39,628
Have you ever killed someone?

814
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:45,202
Your training will tell you that
when the adrenaline kicks in

815
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:47,137
you should compensate.

816
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:52,806
But part of you is not gonna believe
the training because this kill is personal.

817
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:55,379
Take a deep breath.

818
01:25:55,717 --> 01:25:57,480
You only need one shot.

819
01:25:57,552 --> 01:25:59,349
Make it count.

820
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,417
In euros,

821
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:09,788
as requested.

822
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:12,519
The dollar isn't what it once was.

823
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:15,290
The cost of war.

824
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:19,625
I am afraid that the corruption
in this current government

825
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:21,964
can no longer be tolerated.

826
01:27:24,772 --> 01:27:26,069
And mine?

827
01:27:26,774 --> 01:27:29,436
Right after you sign over my land.

828
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,084
My first official act.

829
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,764
And this, if you would.

830
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:56,167
What is this?

831
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:57,431
As of this moment,

832
01:27:57,505 --> 01:28:02,499
my organization owns
more than 60% of Bolivia's water supply.

833
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:06,273
So this contract states
that your new government

834
01:28:06,347 --> 01:28:09,282
will use us as utilities provider.

835
01:28:10,084 --> 01:28:13,019
This is double what we are paying now.

836
01:28:16,591 --> 01:28:18,786
Well, then don't sign it.

837
01:28:19,527 --> 01:28:24,123
But you should know something
about me and the people I work with.

838
01:28:25,266 --> 01:28:27,291
<i>We deal with the
left or the right,</i>

839
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:30,997
with dictators or liberators.

840
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:34,267
If the current president
had been more agreeable,

841
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:36,537
I wouldn't be talking to you.

842
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:38,874
So, if you decide not to sign,

843
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,141
you will wake up
with your balls in your mouth

844
01:28:41,215 --> 01:28:44,548
and your willing replacement
standing over you.

845
01:28:46,387 --> 01:28:48,685
If you doubt that, then shoot me,

846
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:52,021
<i>take that money</i>
<i>and have a good night's sleep.</i>

847
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:54,855
You and I had a mutual friend.

848
01:32:44,892 --> 01:32:47,827
Sounds like you just lost another one.

849
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:59,493
Not this way. Not this way.

850
01:34:00,134 --> 01:34:02,125
I can't. I can't.

851
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:14,645
Come here.

852
01:34:19,754 --> 01:34:21,517
Like you said,

853
01:34:21,622 --> 01:34:23,487
"Take a deep breath.

854
01:34:24,759 --> 01:34:26,351
"Make it count."

855
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,263
Close your eyes.

856
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:44,108
Come on!

857
01:34:58,626 --> 01:35:00,150
Wait here.

858
01:35:32,059 --> 01:35:34,857
- You promised that you'd...
- Let you go?

859
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:37,728
I answered your questions.

860
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:40,562
I told you what you wanted
to know about Quantum.

861
01:35:40,668 --> 01:35:42,192
Yes, you did,

862
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:45,539
and your friends'd know that
so they're probably looking for you.

863
01:35:45,706 --> 01:35:49,335
But the good news is,
you're in the middle of a desert.

864
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,377
Here.

865
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:59,947
I bet you make it 20 miles before you
consider drinking that.

866
01:36:00,054 --> 01:36:01,954
Goodbye, Mr. Greene.

867
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:43,096
Thank you.

868
01:36:43,831 --> 01:36:45,799
It's my pleasure.

869
01:36:46,934 --> 01:36:48,561
Are you all right?

870
01:36:48,969 --> 01:36:50,163
Fine.

871
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:52,970
But I keep thinking, "He's dead.

872
01:36:53,407 --> 01:36:54,772
"Now what?"

873
01:36:55,242 --> 01:36:57,676
Well, the dam we saw
will have to come down,

874
01:36:57,778 --> 01:36:58,802
and there'll be others, too.

875
01:36:58,913 --> 01:37:01,780
Someone who worked for Greene
might be of help.

876
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,481
Not a bad idea.

877
01:37:09,089 --> 01:37:11,990
Do you think they'll
be able to sleep now?

878
01:37:14,361 --> 01:37:17,353
I don't think the dead
care about vengeance.

879
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,995
I wish I could set you free.

880
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,601
But your prison is in there.

881
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:22,328
Fine. Anything for an easy life.

882
01:38:25,833 --> 01:38:27,232
Sit down.

883
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:29,333
Sit down!

884
01:38:30,671 --> 01:38:32,229
It's okay, baby.

885
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:50,716
You're Canadian?

886
01:38:51,258 --> 01:38:53,658
You work in Canadian intelligence?

887
01:38:53,727 --> 01:38:55,922
It's all right. I know you do.

888
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:58,330
And knowing this man,

889
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:00,924
I'd guess you have access
to some very sensitive material

890
01:39:01,035 --> 01:39:03,094
which you're gonna be forced to give up.

891
01:39:03,203 --> 01:39:04,363
His life will be threatened,

892
01:39:04,438 --> 01:39:07,407
and because you love him,
you won't hesitate.

893
01:39:08,375 --> 01:39:10,366
It's a beautiful necklace.

894
01:39:11,078 --> 01:39:13,012
Did he give it to you?

895
01:39:14,915 --> 01:39:17,110
I have one just like it.

896
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:22,422
He gave it to a friend of mine,

897
01:39:22,523 --> 01:39:24,457
someone very close to me.

898
01:39:28,228 --> 01:39:29,559
Your name is?

899
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:31,359
- Corrine.
- Corrine.

900
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:33,456
Corrine, I suggest you leave now.

901
01:39:33,567 --> 01:39:36,035
You contact your people,
and you tell them to check their seals.

902
01:39:36,103 --> 01:39:37,934
They have a leak.

903
01:39:38,038 --> 01:39:39,801
Do it now, please.

904
01:39:40,741 --> 01:39:43,767
This man and I have
some unfinished business.

905
01:39:54,421 --> 01:39:55,786
Thank you.

906
01:40:00,461 --> 01:40:01,723
Please.

907
01:40:02,429 --> 01:40:03,987
Make it quick.

908
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:14,807
Is he still alive?

909
01:40:14,908 --> 01:40:16,102
He is.

910
01:40:16,610 --> 01:40:18,168
I'm surprised.

911
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:21,177
Did you find what you were looking for?

912
01:40:21,281 --> 01:40:22,680
- Yes.
- Good.

913
01:40:24,118 --> 01:40:27,087
- I assume you have no regrets.
- I don't.

914
01:40:27,154 --> 01:40:28,849
What about you?

915
01:40:29,256 --> 01:40:32,157
Of course not.
That would be unprofessional.

916
01:40:33,127 --> 01:40:34,185
They found Greene dead

917
01:40:34,294 --> 01:40:37,024
in the middle of the Bolivian desert,
of all places.

918
01:40:37,131 --> 01:40:39,531
Two bullets in the back of his skull.

919
01:40:39,633 --> 01:40:42,329
They found motor oil in his stomach.

920
01:40:42,436 --> 01:40:44,370
Does that mean anything to you?

921
01:40:44,471 --> 01:40:46,098
Wish I could help.

922
01:40:46,173 --> 01:40:49,199
You'll be glad to know, I straightened
things out with the Americans.

923
01:40:49,309 --> 01:40:51,174
Your friend Leiter's been promoted.

924
01:40:51,278 --> 01:40:52,643
He replaced Beam.

925
01:40:52,713 --> 01:40:55,181
Well, then the right
people kept their jobs.

926
01:40:55,282 --> 01:40:57,011
Something like that.

927
01:40:58,552 --> 01:41:01,112
Congratulations. You were right.

928
01:41:01,188 --> 01:41:02,621
About what?

929
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:04,782
About Vesper.

930
01:41:07,161 --> 01:41:08,492
Ma'am.

931
01:41:10,798 --> 01:41:12,060
Bond,

932
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:15,129
I need you back.

933
01:41:15,536 --> 01:41:17,026
I never left.

934
01:43:17,027 --> 01:43:18,027
