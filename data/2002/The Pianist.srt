1
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,910
- Mr. Szpilman?
- Hello.

2
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,620
I came specially to meet you.
I love your playing.

3
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,710
- Who are you?
- My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.

4
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,420
- You're bleeding!
- It's nothing.

5
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,591
You can write him a fan letter later.
This isn't the best time. Come on.

6
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:13,351
Jurek, where have you been
hiding her?

7
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:20,311
- I don't know what to take.
- You always take too much.

8
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:24,611
How many suitcases are you taking?

9
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:27,821
What do you think, should I take
uncle Szymon's portrait?

10
00:02:28,491 --> 00:02:31,162
Take it, don't take it,
take what you like.

11
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:33,782
Can't you see I'm worried sick?

12
00:02:33,992 --> 00:02:35,742
He'll come home, he'll be alright.

13
00:02:35,952 --> 00:02:39,922
- I should have another case.
- Mama, Wladek is home!

14
00:02:40,422 --> 00:02:44,422
Thank God.
Wladek! You're wounded?

15
00:02:44,592 --> 00:02:47,762
- No, it was nothing.
- I've been worried sick.

16
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:50,512
I told her not to worry.
You had your papers on you.

17
00:02:50,682 --> 00:02:52,592
If you'd been hit by a bomb,
they'd know where to take you.

18
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:57,853
Henryk, don't say things like that.
God forbid. God forbid.

19
00:02:58,063 --> 00:03:00,103
- Papa, Wladek is home.
- What did I tell you?

20
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:03,733
- What are you doing?
- Where's my hat with the wide brim?

21
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:08,653
- They've bombed us. We're off the air.
- Warsaw is not the only radio station.

22
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:10,703
Pack, darling.
Get your things packed.

23
00:03:10,903 --> 00:03:12,953
- Where are we going?
- Out of Warsaw.

24
00:03:13,163 --> 00:03:15,783
- Out of Warsaw where?
- You haven't heard?

25
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:18,624
- Heard what?
- Haven't you seen the paper?

26
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:21,334
- Where's the paper?
- I used it for packing.

27
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:24,044
- She used it for packing.
- The government has moved to Lublin.

28
00:03:24,174 --> 00:03:28,674
All men must leave the city, go across
the river, set up a new line of defense.

29
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:32,804
There isn't anybody left here, only
the women. The men are all gone.

30
00:03:33,014 --> 00:03:35,644
What do you think you'll do while
they set up a new line of defense?

31
00:03:35,854 --> 00:03:39,144
- Wonder around with your suitcases?
- Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

32
00:03:39,354 --> 00:03:43,145
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Good. I'm not going anywhere either.

33
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:45,985
Don't be ridiculous,
we've got to keep together.

34
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:49,535
Look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to
die in my own home, staying put.

35
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:53,615
- God forbid.
- Shut up, I've got something. Listen.

36
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:57,995
...from the BBC in London.
The British government...

37
00:03:58,545 --> 00:04:02,545
having received no reply
to the observations presented...

38
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:05,005
to the German government...

39
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:09,176
has declared war on nazi Germany.

40
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:13,136
- That's wonderful! Wonderful!
- It is expected that...

41
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:23,236
...within the next few hours, France
will make a similar declaration.

42
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,816
Poland is no longer alone.

43
00:04:31,997 --> 00:04:34,247
Wonderful, wonderful!

44
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:39,877
- Mama, that was a great dinner.
- It certainly was.

45
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:42,587
When there's something to celebrate,
you've got to make an effort.

46
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:45,757
Here's to Great Britain and France!

47
00:04:46,297 --> 00:04:49,757
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?
All will be well.

48
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:25,219
Five thousand and three.

49
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,549
- Is that all?
- Yes. It's all we've got left.

50
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,929
- It's 3,003 too much.
- Look.

51
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:37,519
"Further restrictions
regarding liquid assets.

52
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:40,939
Jews will be allowed to keep a
maximum of 2,000 zlotys at home. "

53
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:45,650
- What do we do with the rest?
- Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.

54
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,610
Banks! Who'd be stupid enough
to deposit money in a German bank?

55
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,450
We could hide the money. Look here.
We can hide it under the flowerpots.

56
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,710
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll use try and tested methods.

57
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,330
You know what we did
in the last war?

58
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,420
We made a hole in the table leg,
and hid the money in there.

59
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,091
- Suppose they take the table away?
- What do you mean?

60
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:11,891
Germans go into Jewish homes and
take furniture, valuables, anything.

61
00:06:12,101 --> 00:06:14,891
- Do they?
- Why'd they want a table like this?

62
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:19,141
- What on earth are you doing?
- Listen. Look.

63
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:23,441
This is the best place. No-one would
think of looking under the flowerpot.

64
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:26,781
- No, listen. I've been thinking...
- Really? That's a change.

65
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:30,282
- You know what? We use psychology.
- We use what?

66
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:35,412
We leave the money and the watch
on the table, covered. In full view.

67
00:06:38,252 --> 00:06:41,172
- Are you stupid?
- The Germans will never notice it.

68
00:06:41,372 --> 00:06:45,302
That's the stupidest thing I've ever
seen. Of course they'll notice. Look.

69
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:47,882
Look here.

70
00:06:48,382 --> 00:06:49,972
Idiot.

71
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:53,013
- And you call me stupid.
- Very good. That's the last place...

72
00:06:53,223 --> 00:06:55,313
- This would take hours.
- We're not in a hurry.

73
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:58,733
- It won't take hours.
- How will you get them out? Tell me.

74
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:01,983
- How will you get them out?
- Quiet! Order, please!

75
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:04,903
- You reach them out individually.
- No-one listens to me!

76
00:07:05,113 --> 00:07:07,943
Quiet, please, quiet.
Order, order, please.

77
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:12,413
- The lawyer, she likes order.
- Listen, just listen. Look.

78
00:07:12,613 --> 00:07:16,203
The watch we put under the flowerpot
and the money we stuff in the violin.

79
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:22,874
- But I'll still be able to play?
- You'll find out.

80
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:26,844
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.
- Wladek, how are you?

81
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:29,094
We're fine, thank you.
And you?

82
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:34,554
Fine, under the circumstances.
I guess I know why you're calling.

83
00:07:34,724 --> 00:07:38,934
There's nothing we can do.
They won't reopen the station.

84
00:07:39,144 --> 00:07:43,905
- Yes, I know, but I...
- No music, no radio for the Polish.

85
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:47,405
But sure you'll find work.
A pianist like you.

86
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:50,035
Maybe, maybe not, but...

87
00:07:50,615 --> 00:07:55,375
don't be offended, but I didn't call
to discuss my future carrier.

88
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,795
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,
and at last he gave in and said...

89
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:02,165
"All right, come with me tomorrow",
so I came and...

90
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,756
they bombed the station.

91
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:08,466
- Meeting you like that was wonderful.
- Really?

92
00:08:08,676 --> 00:08:12,136
Yes, it was unforgettable.

93
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:15,936
- I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
- Call me Wladek, please.

94
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:19,396
- No-one plays Chopin like you.
- I hope it's a compliment.

95
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:23,276
- Of course, I mean it.
- I was... trying to be funny.

96
00:08:24,106 --> 00:08:27,776
- Should we go and have a coffee?
- I'd like that.

97
00:08:29,237 --> 00:08:33,077
- And you, what do you do?
- I finished with the conservatoire.

98
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:36,247
- You're a musician?
- Yes. But only just.

99
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:39,037
- What instrument?
- The cello.

100
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:41,837
I love to see women
playing the cello.

101
00:08:44,547 --> 00:08:46,257
JEWS FORBIDDEN

102
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:49,717
This is disgraceful.
How dare they?

103
00:08:49,927 --> 00:08:52,768
You know what people are like, they
want to be better nazis than Hitler.

104
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:56,848
- I'm going in there to complain.
- It's better not, believe me.

105
00:08:57,058 --> 00:09:00,358
- It's humiliating. Someone like you!
- Good-bye.

106
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:07,158
We'll find somewhere else.

107
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:10,658
- We can walk in the park.
- No, we can't.

108
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:14,198
Official decree.
No Jews allowed in the park.

109
00:09:15,038 --> 00:09:17,539
- My God. Are you joking?
- I'm not joking, it's true.

110
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:22,629
We could sit in a bench, but
"no Jews allowed on public benches".

111
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:24,669
This is absurd.

112
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:30,799
We can just stand here and talk.
I think we're allowed to do that.

113
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,349
So, you play the cello. That's nice.
And who's your favorite composer?

114
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,899
Chopin? Really? Well...

115
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:42,020
you'll have to learn to play
his cello sonata, won't you?

116
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,360
What about you, Wladek?

117
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,530
Perhaps I could accompany.
Me on the piano, you on the cello.

118
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,080
Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,
quite wonderful.

119
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,370
Call me Wladek, please.

120
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,250
"Free emblems for Jews
in the Warsaw district.

121
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,380
I hereby order that all Jews
in the Warsaw district...

122
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:06,841
will wear visible emblems
when out of doors.

123
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:11,891
This decree will come into force
on the first of December, 1939...

124
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:15,521
and applies to all Jews
over 12 years of age.

125
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:19,101
The emblem will be worn
on the right sleeve...

126
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:23,061
and will represent the blue star
of David on a white background.

127
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:26,781
The background must be
sufficiently large...

128
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:30,742
for the star to measure eight
centimeters from point to point.

129
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:35,452
The width of the arms of the star
must be one centimeter.

130
00:10:35,662 --> 00:10:41,002
The Jews that do not respect this
decree will be severely punished.

Governor of the Warsaw district,
Dr. Fischer. "

132
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:53,473
- I won't wear it.
- I'm not going to be branded.

133
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:59,563
Let me see this.

134
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:07,693
Does it say that we have to provide
these armbands ourselves?

135
00:11:08,323 --> 00:11:12,663
- Where will we get them?
- We're not going to wear them.

136
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,584
You!

137
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:26,804
Come here.

138
00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:35,104
Why haven't you greeted us?

139
00:11:36,264 --> 00:11:38,184
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:51,495
The sidewalk is forbidden for you.

141
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:53,785
Go to the gutter.

142
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:14,136
- Have you seen this?
- What? What? I'm working. What?

143
00:12:15,896 --> 00:12:17,436
What is this?

144
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:22,356
- It's where they're going to put us.
- What do you mean "put us"?

145
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:28,487
"By order of the governor of the
Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer...

146
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:32,367
concerning the establishment of
the Jewish district in Warsaw.

147
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:38,207
There'll be created a Jewish district
in which Jews will have to reside. "

148
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:42,917
Look here. "Jews living outside
of the prescribed area...

149
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:48,427
will have to move to the Jewish
district by 31 of October, 1940."

150
00:12:49,677 --> 00:12:51,848
They won't get all of us.
It's too small.

151
00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:54,058
There's 400 thousand of us
in Warsaw.

152
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:57,808
No, 360 thousand.
So it will be easy.

153
00:12:58,018 --> 00:13:01,898
What am I supposed to do?
You tell me.

154
00:13:05,448 --> 00:13:07,448
Mama?

155
00:13:08,158 --> 00:13:10,738
Mama, what is it?

156
00:13:12,788 --> 00:13:15,329
20 zlotys!

157
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:18,789
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.

158
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:25,549
What can I buy with 20 zlotys?

159
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:30,219
I'm sick of cooking potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.

160
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,900
That's the price.
That's what I'm offering.

161
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,820
My advice is to accept.
You won't get more from anyone else.

162
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,950
- But it's a Bechstein!
- 2 thousand. My advice is to take it.

163
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,160
What are you going to do when
you're hungry? Eat the piano?

164
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,160
- Get out!
- What's the matter with you?

165
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,290
- Stop it!
- We'd rather give it away. Get out!

166
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,670
Haven't you eaten today?
What are you suffering from?

167
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,541
You people are crazy.

168
00:14:03,171 --> 00:14:06,761
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand
and I'm paying for the removal.

169
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,551
I'm not even charging
for the removal!

170
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:13,011
You haven't eaten today.
You're crazy.

171
00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:15,061
Take it.

172
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:51,303
Hello.

173
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:54,763
Hello. Hi.

174
00:14:56,893 --> 00:14:59,183
I didn't want to come.

175
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:03,983
I didn't want to see all this, but...
I couldn't stop myself.

176
00:15:04,193 --> 00:15:06,113
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

177
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,323
Good.

178
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:12,203
No, not really.
They arrested my cousin.

179
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,784
Jurek says they'll let him out.

180
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:20,624
- This is disgraceful.
- It won't last long. Don't worry.

181
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:23,794
That's what I said myself.

182
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:26,674
It's too absurd.

183
00:15:30,884 --> 00:15:33,844
I... I should go.

184
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,645
Well, I'll see you...

185
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:40,605
soon.

186
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:47,405
Good-bye.

187
00:16:01,756 --> 00:16:03,716
Well...

188
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:08,006
to tell you the truth,
I thought it would be worse.

189
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:18,646
- Where will we sleep?
- I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

190
00:16:18,856 --> 00:16:21,856
You, Henryk and papa, in here.

191
00:16:23,446 --> 00:16:25,407
Look.

192
00:16:26,657 --> 00:16:28,947
Come and look.

193
00:17:01,268 --> 00:17:03,188
Go away.

194
00:17:03,358 --> 00:17:05,648
Go away! Go away!

195
00:17:06,698 --> 00:17:09,908
Papa! Papa!

196
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:29,219
- Sell anything?
- Just one. Dostoievski, "The Idiot".

197
00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:32,059
- 3 zlotys.
- It's better than yesterday.

198
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:36,520
Three lousy zlotys. And there are
people there making millions.

199
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,400
- I know.
- You don't know, believe me.

200
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,020
They bribe the guards,
the guards turn a blind eye.

201
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:48,030
They bring cartloads of food,
tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

202
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,030
And the poor are dying all around
and they don't give a damn.

203
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:54,040
Excuse me, have you seen
my husband, Izaak Szerman?

204
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,460
A tall handsome man,
with a little gray beard.

205
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:03,211
- I'm afraid not.
- Excuse me. Good-bye.

206
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:07,091
Sleep well. But if you see him,
write to me, yes?

207
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:09,341
Izaak Szerman.

208
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:27,572
Why do we have to have a gentile
street running through our area?

209
00:18:27,782 --> 00:18:29,952
Why can't they go around?

210
00:18:30,162 --> 00:18:33,872
Don't worry. They're about to build
a bridge. Haven't you heard?

211
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:36,792
A bridge! Those idiots.

212
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:40,582
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

213
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:44,292
But do you know what I think?
I think they're totally stupid.

214
00:18:44,632 --> 00:18:47,512
I have a family to feed.
I spend half of my time here...

215
00:18:47,713 --> 00:18:49,973
waiting for them to let us through.

216
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:53,433
Maybe they think I come here
to listen to the music?

217
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:58,813
- What is it? Are you in a hurry?
- What's wrong with you?

218
00:18:58,983 --> 00:19:03,313
- Come on, do something.
- Right. Dance!

219
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:06,273
- Dance!
- Dance!

220
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:09,403
Come on, come on! Dance!

221
00:19:12,664 --> 00:19:14,454
Very well.

222
00:19:14,664 --> 00:19:16,624
What about you?
Dance with him.

223
00:19:18,084 --> 00:19:22,374
Let's clear the street,
so the Jews can dance.

224
00:19:25,674 --> 00:19:27,964
Come on. And you.

225
00:19:34,054 --> 00:19:35,765
Go on.

226
00:19:37,315 --> 00:19:38,275
Faster!

227
00:19:39,985 --> 00:19:42,145
Come on!

228
00:19:43,855 --> 00:19:44,855
Faster!

229
00:19:48,695 --> 00:19:50,445
Come on!

230
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:53,955
Faster!

231
00:19:56,205 --> 00:20:00,876
Come on, move! I said faster!
Come on, Jews!

232
00:20:01,086 --> 00:20:04,086
- Keep dancing.
- Dance.

233
00:20:22,896 --> 00:20:24,607
Good, they're here.

234
00:20:26,237 --> 00:20:29,277
Itzak Heller has been
waiting for you.

235
00:20:35,497 --> 00:20:37,037
- What's this about?
- Sit down, have tea.

236
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,707
I'll start lunch
when the girls get here.

237
00:20:45,587 --> 00:20:48,928
- So, what are you doing here?
- He brought cakes.

238
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:54,768
His father is back in the jewellery
business. He's doing well.

239
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:59,728
Amazing, jewellery.

240
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:02,318
- We're recruiting.
- Who is recruiting?

241
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:04,988
Don't be clever with me.
I'm coming as a friend.

242
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:07,408
They're bringing Jews in
from all over the country.

243
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:09,658
Soon there will be half million people
in the ghetto.

244
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:13,829
- We need more Jewish police.
- More Jewish police!

245
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,539
You want me to beat up Jews
and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see.

246
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:20,289
- Someone has got to do it.
- But why me?

247
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:22,879
I thought you only recruited boys
with rich fathers.

248
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:25,089
Look at my father, look at us...

249
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:28,429
I'm looking at you, that's why I'm
here. You can have a better life.

250
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:32,059
- You want to survive selling books?
- Yes, please.

251
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:35,640
I'm doing you people a favor.

252
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,600
What about you?
You're a great pianist.

253
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,270
We've got a police jazz band.
They'd welcome you with open arms.

254
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,650
- Join us. You've got no work.
- Thank you, I've got work.

255
00:22:33,912 --> 00:22:35,872
I'm sorry, he wants you to stop.

256
00:22:38,332 --> 00:22:40,832
Who wants me to stop?

257
00:23:32,094 --> 00:23:33,935
I always say,
look on the bright side.

258
00:23:34,265 --> 00:23:37,565
You're in a small ghetto with
intellectuals, professional people.

259
00:23:37,765 --> 00:23:41,315
You're better off than us. Here in
the large ghetto it's a cesspool.

260
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:44,655
- You have to give me something.
- You're an artist...

261
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:46,905
you keep peoples' spirits up.
You do enough.

262
00:23:47,155 --> 00:23:50,655
- I want to help, do something.
- You're too well known.

263
00:23:50,865 --> 00:23:55,785
And you know what? You musicians
don't make good conspirators.

264
00:23:55,995 --> 00:24:00,126
You're too... too musical.

265
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:07,096
- Who is that?
- Symche.

266
00:24:07,296 --> 00:24:09,466
Majorek.

267
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:13,686
There are notices going up. City is
to be cleansed of the undesirables.

268
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:16,896
- There's always notices going up.
- Hello, Symche.

269
00:24:17,976 --> 00:24:21,276
Dyrek. Mrs. Ysken.

270
00:24:22,987 --> 00:24:25,107
Jehuda, working hard?

271
00:24:25,317 --> 00:24:29,277
This is the greatest pianist in
Poland. Maybe the whole world.

272
00:24:29,487 --> 00:24:32,407
Wladyslaw Szpilman,
meet Majorek.

273
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:34,457
- How do you do?
- I know your name.

274
00:24:35,577 --> 00:24:38,167
- I've never heard you play.
- Majorek used to be in the Army.

275
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:43,377
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got
against him is he's not a socialist.

276
00:24:44,757 --> 00:24:48,138
You better go now, Wladek.
It's nearly curfew.

277
00:24:49,218 --> 00:24:52,098
You know how many copies
we print of our newspaper?

278
00:24:52,518 --> 00:24:54,308
Five hundred.

279
00:24:54,478 --> 00:24:57,808
You know how many people on
average read one copy? Twenty.

280
00:24:58,018 --> 00:25:02,648
That makes 10 thousand readers.
This will start the uprising.

281
00:25:02,858 --> 00:25:06,108
Majorek hides them in his underpants
and leaves them in toilets.

282
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:09,159
- Toilets?
- As many toilets as I can find.

283
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:11,909
Germans never use Jewish toilets.

284
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:14,119
They're too clean for them.

285
00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:22,879
Please, mister, please.

286
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,450
Hold it!
You little bastard!

287
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,421
Take this!

288
00:25:59,581 --> 00:26:01,631
Stop it! Stop it!

289
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:03,631
Stop it!

290
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:09,591
Come on, come on.
Come on, boy.

291
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:19,601
Stand up! Stand up.

292
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:54,223
Please, tonight for once, I don't
want anything bad talked about.

293
00:26:54,433 --> 00:26:57,973
- Enjoy your meal.
- Then I'll tell you something funny.

294
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:01,193
- You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?
- The surgeon.

295
00:27:01,393 --> 00:27:06,233
The Germans allowed him into
the ghetto to perform an operation.

296
00:27:06,443 --> 00:27:09,614
On a Jew? They let a Pole
to come in to operate on a Jew?

297
00:27:09,824 --> 00:27:13,244
He got a pass, that's all I know.
Anyway, so...

298
00:27:13,454 --> 00:27:15,834
he puts the patient to sleep
and starts the operation.

299
00:27:15,994 --> 00:27:18,334
He'd just made the first incision
when the SS burst in...

300
00:27:18,954 --> 00:27:23,124
shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja
and everybody else who was there.

301
00:27:25,464 --> 00:27:27,924
Isn't that a laugh?

302
00:27:28,844 --> 00:27:32,055
The patient didn't feel a thing,
he was anesthetized.

303
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:34,055
I said nothing bad.

304
00:27:34,725 --> 00:27:38,475
What's the matter with you all?
You lost your sense of humor?

305
00:27:39,605 --> 00:27:41,355
It's not funny.

306
00:27:41,565 --> 00:27:44,985
You know what's funny? You're
funny, with that ridiculous tie.

307
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:49,365
What are you talking about? What's
my tie have to do with anything?

308
00:27:49,695 --> 00:27:51,825
- I need this tie for my work.
- Your work?

309
00:27:52,035 --> 00:27:56,326
- That's right, I work.
- Playing the piano for the parasites.

310
00:27:56,536 --> 00:27:59,706
- Parasites...
- Boys. Boys!

311
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:02,466
- They don't give a damn.
- And you blame me for their apathy?

312
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:06,176
I see it everyday. They don't even
notice what's going around them.

313
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:08,346
- I blame the Americans.
- For what? For my tie?

314
00:28:08,926 --> 00:28:11,726
The American Jews,
and there are lots of them.

315
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:16,016
What do they think they're doing?
People here are dying.

316
00:28:16,226 --> 00:28:18,516
Haven't got a bite to eat.

317
00:28:19,146 --> 00:28:24,027
The Jewish bankers should persuade
America to declare war on Germany.

318
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:43,127
The lights! The lights!

319
00:29:01,018 --> 00:29:05,278
Turn on the lights.

320
00:29:07,949 --> 00:29:10,659
Come on!

321
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:17,919
Open the door!
We want to go in!

322
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:21,749
Open the door!

323
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,640
Stand up!

324
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:43,400
You, stand up! Come on!

325
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,610
Throw him out!

326
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:01,961
Mama...

327
00:30:14,351 --> 00:30:17,771
Come on, run!

328
00:31:24,504 --> 00:31:29,014
- I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.
- Go in. Not you.

329
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,945
- What?
- Come. It's terrible.

330
00:31:51,155 --> 00:31:54,286
- What?
- They're hunting people in the streets.

331
00:31:54,536 --> 00:31:56,746
They've taken Henryk.

332
00:31:58,336 --> 00:32:01,376
Go home, alright? Go home,
I'll take care of it.

333
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,726
Excuse me. Have you seen
my husband? Izaak Szerman?

334
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:20,817
- I'm afraid not.
- Tall, handsome, little gray beard.

335
00:32:21,027 --> 00:32:24,737
If you see him, write to me.
Don't forget. Izaak Szerman.

336
00:32:34,707 --> 00:32:36,497
What happened here?

337
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:40,457
They've got my grandson. They
pick them up and take them away.

338
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:44,378
What they do to them,
I've stopped believing in God.

339
00:32:45,258 --> 00:32:48,088
Excuse me. Excuse me.

340
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:51,008
Itzak?

341
00:32:51,598 --> 00:32:53,138
Itzak?

342
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:56,848
Itzak, it's Wladek Szpilman.

343
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,649
- Henryk is in there.
- I haven't seen him.

344
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,029
Believe me.
They picked him up.

345
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:16,369
- Can you help?
- Now you need me. Now you need me!

346
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:18,789
Can you help us?

347
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:22,169
- It costs.
- I have no money.

348
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,969
Then there's nothing I can do.
You should have joined us.

349
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:29,590
- They told me you had influence.
- Who told you?

350
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,350
People I know. They said
you're an important man.

351
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,480
Itzak...

352
00:33:54,371 --> 00:33:57,331
- Hands up.
- How are you?

353
00:33:57,541 --> 00:34:01,251
- How are you?
- You, bandit.

354
00:34:01,461 --> 00:34:03,631
Dead! Dead!

355
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:07,051
- He's crazy.
- Hands up.

356
00:34:07,261 --> 00:34:10,391
- Want a cigarette?
- Cigarette?

357
00:34:10,891 --> 00:34:13,891
Thank you.

358
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:18,562
Everything is alright!

359
00:34:18,772 --> 00:34:20,902
He looks very happy.

360
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:23,982
Everything is alright.

361
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:27,612
Everything is alright.

362
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:31,742
Hands up! Hands up!

363
00:34:32,242 --> 00:34:33,622
It's alright.

364
00:34:35,412 --> 00:34:37,622
Help! Help!

365
00:34:37,832 --> 00:34:41,463
Let go! Help!

366
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:38,225
- Why did they pick you up?
- So you go to Itzak Heller?

367
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:41,985
- Did I ask you to talk to him?
- You're out, aren't you?

368
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:47,115
- Did you beg to that piece of shit?
- I asked him to help you.

369
00:35:47,735 --> 00:35:49,995
What did you pay him?

370
00:35:50,945 --> 00:35:55,456
With what could I pay him? Every
zloty I earn we spend on food.

371
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:58,706
- I can look after myself.
- They were taking you away.

372
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:02,836
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's me they wanted, not you.

373
00:36:03,046 --> 00:36:06,386
Why do you have to interfere
with other people's business?

374
00:36:06,546 --> 00:36:10,716
- You're mad. That's your trouble.
- That's also my business.

375
00:36:19,937 --> 00:36:23,277
What's the matter?
Are you sick?

376
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:26,737
Hungry.

377
00:36:33,957 --> 00:36:38,287
Employment certificate. What's that
mean, no employment certificate?

378
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:41,338
You have to have an
employment certificate...

379
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:44,128
to work for the Germans
in the ghetto, otherwise...

380
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:47,178
- Otherwise what?
- You'll be deported.

381
00:36:47,388 --> 00:36:50,718
- So the rumors were true.
- They're going to resettle us...

382
00:36:51,638 --> 00:36:54,768
and send us to labor camps,
in the East.

383
00:36:56,688 --> 00:36:59,688
- They're closing the small ghetto.
- Oh, God!

384
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,919
Wladek? Wladek?

385
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:21,879
I thought you were on tour playing
in London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

386
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:24,879
- Not this week.
- You look terrible.

387
00:37:25,219 --> 00:37:28,050
Have you heard the rumors? They're
going to resettle us in the East.

388
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,390
Rumors! You take it all too much
to heart. What's the trouble?

389
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:37,020
I've been trying to get the certificate
of employment for my father.

390
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,610
I managed to get one for me and my
family, but I need one for my father.

391
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:44,030
- I've been to all the firms and shops...
- Why didn't you come to me?

392
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,400
I didn't know you were
in the certificate business.

393
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,070
I'm not, but Majorek is.

394
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,371
Can you help?
I have no money.

395
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:56,961
Please, don't insult us.
Can you do something for him?

396
00:37:57,161 --> 00:37:59,581
Be at the Schultz workshop
tomorrow, four o'clock.

397
00:37:59,871 --> 00:38:02,541
See what a wonderful piece
of luck you've had today?

398
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:06,631
That's the historical imperative in
action! That's why I always say:

399
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:09,221
- "Look on the bright side!"
- Yes, I know.

400
00:38:22,362 --> 00:38:24,942
- How's your back?
- Better.

401
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:27,152
Better?

402
00:38:27,322 --> 00:38:29,322
Better not ask.

403
00:38:42,383 --> 00:38:47,513
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

404
00:38:49,973 --> 00:38:52,303
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

405
00:40:03,216 --> 00:40:06,336
At least we got work
in the ghetto.

406
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:09,716
At least we are still together.

407
00:40:23,737 --> 00:40:26,407
Everybody out!
To the courtyard!

408
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:28,987
Move, move!

409
00:40:29,577 --> 00:40:33,957
We are workers. We have
employment certification.

410
00:40:37,747 --> 00:40:39,878
Wait.

411
00:40:40,628 --> 00:40:41,628
Here.

412
00:40:41,918 --> 00:40:45,048
Go over there. Hurry.

413
00:40:45,258 --> 00:40:47,258
You.

414
00:40:47,638 --> 00:40:50,348
You. You.

415
00:40:52,138 --> 00:40:53,928
You.

416
00:40:55,638 --> 00:40:57,558
You.

417
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:01,148
You.

418
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:13,409
The others, put your clothes on
and come back here.

419
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:16,829
Bring your things with you.
15 kilos only.

420
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:19,959
Where are you taking us?

421
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,240
I'm sorry, I did my best.

422
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:51,621
- I thought the certificates'd save us.
- Stop it, Wladek.

423
00:41:51,781 --> 00:41:55,411
Let's just hope that Henryk
and Halina will be better off.

424
00:42:22,942 --> 00:42:25,282
- Where will we be going?
- You're going to work.

425
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,862
You'll be much better off than
in the stinking ghetto. Move.

426
00:42:33,492 --> 00:42:37,453
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

427
00:42:38,163 --> 00:42:43,543
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?

428
00:42:44,843 --> 00:42:48,383
Why did I do it?

429
00:43:31,595 --> 00:43:34,305
Don't you have a bottle of water?
He's dying.

430
00:43:34,515 --> 00:43:36,435
My child is dying of thirst.

431
00:43:36,605 --> 00:43:38,525
- I beg you.
- I'm sorry.

432
00:43:38,685 --> 00:43:42,605
- Don't you have water? I beg you.
- Can you hear what I'm saying?

433
00:43:42,775 --> 00:43:45,115
- I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.
- I can hear you.

434
00:43:45,315 --> 00:43:47,655
Letting them take us to our death
like sheep to the slaughter.

435
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,996
- Not so loud.
- Why don't we attack them?

436
00:43:50,196 --> 00:43:53,366
There's half a million of us here.
We can break out of the ghetto.

437
00:43:53,576 --> 00:43:56,286
At least we can die honorably, not
as a stain on the face of History.

438
00:43:56,496 --> 00:43:59,206
Why are you so sure they're
sending us to our death?

439
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:02,006
You know why I'm not sure?
Because they didn't tell me.

440
00:44:02,546 --> 00:44:06,256
- They're going to wipe us all out.
- What do you want me to do? Fight?

441
00:44:06,466 --> 00:44:09,096
To fight, we need organization,
plans, guns.

442
00:44:09,256 --> 00:44:11,926
He's right. Do you think I'm going
to fight with my violin bowl?

443
00:44:12,136 --> 00:44:14,977
The Germans would never squander
a huge labor force like this.

444
00:44:15,517 --> 00:44:17,607
They're sending us to a labor camp,
it's obvious.

445
00:44:17,807 --> 00:44:19,187
Sure.

446
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:23,777
Look at that cripple, the old people,
the children. They're going to work?

447
00:44:24,027 --> 00:44:27,777
Look at you. You're going to carry
logs on your back?

448
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:13,079
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!

449
00:45:22,999 --> 00:45:27,430
I missed you.
I wanted to be with you!

450
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,770
I wanted to be with you!

451
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,060
Stupid. Stupid.

452
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,690
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

453
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,161
She's getting on my nerves.

454
00:45:53,161 --> 00:45:58,121
- What did she do, for God's sake?
- She smothered her baby.

455
00:46:00,131 --> 00:46:03,671
They prepared a hiding place
and of course they went there.

456
00:46:03,881 --> 00:46:06,761
The baby cried
just as the police came.

457
00:46:06,971 --> 00:46:11,141
She smothered the cries with
her hands, the baby died.

458
00:46:12,392 --> 00:46:16,182
A policeman heard the death rattle
and found where they were hiding.

459
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,633
What are you reading?

460
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:50,933
"If you prick us, de we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

461
00:46:51,093 --> 00:46:53,353
If you poison us, do we not die?

462
00:46:53,553 --> 00:46:56,683
And, if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?"

463
00:47:04,314 --> 00:47:07,824
- Very appropriate.
- Yes. That's why I brought it.

464
00:47:25,675 --> 00:47:29,305
Idiot. What does he think
he's gonna do with the money?

465
00:47:30,385 --> 00:47:33,135
Boy, come here.

466
00:47:33,895 --> 00:47:35,685
Come here.

467
00:47:37,015 --> 00:47:39,025
- How much for a caramel?
- 20 zlotys.

468
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,695
For one caramel? What do you think
you're gonna do with the money?

469
00:47:42,895 --> 00:47:45,195
20 zlotys.

470
00:47:46,735 --> 00:47:48,946
We've got 20 between us.

471
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,706
I've got 10, I think.

472
00:47:54,456 --> 00:47:57,246
5, 10, 20.

473
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:22,800
- Halina?
- What?

474
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:28,130
- It's a funny time to say this, but...
- What?

475
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,680
I wish I knew you better.

476
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,440
Thank you.

477
00:49:53,831 --> 00:49:55,541
Szpilman?

478
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:07,671
Papa? Papa?

479
00:50:10,051 --> 00:50:12,472
Mama? Halina?

480
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,642
Halina? Mama?

481
00:50:16,272 --> 00:50:21,272
What do you think you're doing?
I've saved your life. Just go! Go!

482
00:50:24,902 --> 00:50:27,192
Don't run!

483
00:50:28,782 --> 00:50:30,862
Anna!

484
00:50:31,032 --> 00:50:33,412
Anna!

485
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:56,263
Off they go to the melting pot.

486
00:50:59,314 --> 00:51:04,064
- This stays.
- Give it to me!

487
00:51:09,154 --> 00:51:11,914
What are you doing?
She's pregnant.

488
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,900
Wladek?

489
00:53:59,081 --> 00:54:02,171
Why are you here, Wladek?

490
00:54:02,381 --> 00:54:05,091
It's like this, I...

491
00:54:06,761 --> 00:54:08,682
We...

492
00:54:10,972 --> 00:54:13,892
All of them, all of them.

493
00:54:14,062 --> 00:54:16,312
All of them.

494
00:54:17,432 --> 00:54:21,402
Perhaps they're lucky.
The quicker, the better.

495
00:54:21,602 --> 00:54:24,772
It's not finished yet. We'll stay
here for a couple of days...

496
00:54:24,982 --> 00:54:26,992
until things die down.

497
00:54:27,192 --> 00:54:30,702
I've bribed the policeman,
he'll come when it's over.

498
00:54:32,913 --> 00:54:36,663
Attention!
On the march!

499
00:54:46,673 --> 00:54:48,633
Onward!

500
00:54:51,013 --> 00:54:54,143
My God, I haven't been outside in,
it must be two years.

501
00:54:54,353 --> 00:54:57,354
Don't get overexcited.

502
00:55:13,324 --> 00:55:16,534
It's gold.
Very good price.

503
00:55:37,605 --> 00:55:39,565
Someone you know?

504
00:55:39,725 --> 00:55:41,735
A beauty.
Who is she?

505
00:55:41,945 --> 00:55:46,026
She's a singer. I knew her well.
Her husband is an actor.

506
00:55:46,236 --> 00:55:48,696
They're good people.
I'd like to talk to her.

507
00:55:48,866 --> 00:55:52,746
Don't forget, Wladek.
They hang them for helping Jews.

508
00:56:19,567 --> 00:56:21,987
Turn left!

509
00:56:22,147 --> 00:56:24,647
On the march!

510
00:56:28,827 --> 00:56:31,618
Stop! Halt!
Attention!

511
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:41,878
At ease.

512
00:56:45,968 --> 00:56:48,758
Turn right!

513
00:56:55,939 --> 00:56:58,649
Step forward.

514
00:56:59,189 --> 00:57:00,769
You.

515
00:57:03,029 --> 00:57:05,609
You. You.

516
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,159
You.

517
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:14,199
Down on the ground!

518
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:17,539
Down on the ground!

519
00:57:44,821 --> 00:57:46,951
Turn left!

520
00:57:48,111 --> 00:57:50,571
On the march.

521
00:58:30,613 --> 00:58:32,873
How long have you been here?

522
00:58:33,073 --> 00:58:35,993
Since last night.

523
00:58:36,203 --> 00:58:38,623
I was pleased to see you.

524
00:58:42,543 --> 00:58:45,883
They're going to start
the final resettlement now.

525
00:58:47,713 --> 00:58:50,053
We know what it means.

526
00:58:51,133 --> 00:58:55,064
We sent someone out.
Zygmund, a good man.

527
00:58:57,564 --> 00:59:01,064
His orders were to follow
the trains out of Warsaw.

528
00:59:02,404 --> 00:59:04,614
He got to Sokolow.

529
00:59:04,814 --> 00:59:09,574
A man told him the tracks divided,
one branch's leading to Treblinka.

530
00:59:11,324 --> 00:59:15,204
He said everyday freight trains
carrying people from Warsaw...

531
00:59:15,414 --> 00:59:19,415
branch off to Treblinka
and return empty.

532
00:59:19,585 --> 00:59:22,625
No transports of food
are ever seen on that line.

533
00:59:23,465 --> 00:59:26,885
The civilians are forbidden
to approach the Treblinka station.

534
00:59:30,925 --> 00:59:33,225
They're exterminating us.

535
00:59:37,065 --> 00:59:39,725
It won't take them long.

536
00:59:41,105 --> 00:59:44,696
We are 60 thousand left,
out of half a million.

537
00:59:45,486 --> 00:59:48,076
Mostly young people.

538
00:59:49,326 --> 00:59:52,406
And this time we're gonna fight.

539
00:59:54,166 --> 00:59:56,956
We're in good shape.

540
00:59:57,166 --> 01:00:01,126
Organized.
We're prepared.

541
01:00:01,296 --> 01:00:04,176
If you need help, I...

542
01:00:23,647 --> 01:00:26,987
You! Come here!

543
01:00:28,027 --> 01:00:29,828
Shit!

544
01:00:37,878 --> 01:00:40,248
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

545
01:00:41,378 --> 01:00:43,918
I don't know what I was thinking.

546
01:00:53,178 --> 01:00:57,599
Take this! Take this!

547
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:15,079
Take him away.

548
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:34,390
I hope you play the piano better
than you carry bricks.

549
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:38,650
He won't last long
if he goes on like this.

550
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:41,771
I'll see if I can get him
something better.

551
01:02:04,461 --> 01:02:06,212
Trouble.

552
01:02:06,462 --> 01:02:08,932
Round up only the Jews!

553
01:02:09,182 --> 01:02:12,102
Round up!
Only the Jews.

554
01:02:12,352 --> 01:02:15,772
The Polish keep working.
Only the Jews.

555
01:02:23,062 --> 01:02:26,032
I have good news for you.

556
01:02:26,232 --> 01:02:31,163
There are rumors going around
that we like to...

557
01:02:31,363 --> 01:02:34,283
to resettle you.

558
01:02:36,203 --> 01:02:41,253
I promise you that now
and in the future...

559
01:02:41,463 --> 01:02:45,053
nothing else is planned.

560
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:52,393
For this reason, we put
information posters on the wall.

561
01:02:53,724 --> 01:02:57,064
To show you our goodwill...

562
01:02:57,224 --> 01:03:01,194
you should vote one of you
to be allowed...

563
01:03:01,394 --> 01:03:04,444
to go in town daily...

564
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:11,034
and bring 3 kilos of potatoes...

565
01:03:11,244 --> 01:03:15,744
and one loaf of bread
for each of your workers.

566
01:03:15,914 --> 01:03:21,375
So, why should we do something
like this if we'd resettle you?

567
01:03:22,585 --> 01:03:27,965
You can make good business
out of the things you don't eat.

568
01:03:29,465 --> 01:03:35,145
Isn't that something that you Jews
are good in? Making money?

569
01:03:39,105 --> 01:03:40,276
Dismiss them.

570
01:03:56,626 --> 01:04:00,586
That one, with the string.
The others, tied by wire.

571
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:10,489
Now!

572
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,031
Majorek.

573
01:05:51,741 --> 01:05:54,701
I have a favor to ask.

574
01:05:55,331 --> 01:05:57,711
I want to get out of here.

575
01:06:00,421 --> 01:06:04,922
It's easy to get out. It's how you'll
survive on the other side that's hard.

576
01:06:05,132 --> 01:06:07,422
I know.

577
01:06:08,222 --> 01:06:12,102
Last summer, I worked for a day
in the Zelazna Brama Square.

578
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:15,812
I saw someone I knew,
she's an old friend.

579
01:06:15,932 --> 01:06:19,482
A singer, her husband
is an actor.

580
01:06:20,982 --> 01:06:25,112
I've filled their names down and
their address, if they're still there.

581
01:06:25,282 --> 01:06:30,243
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej
Bogucki. They're good people.

582
01:06:31,243 --> 01:06:34,203
Would you try to make contact?

583
01:06:35,293 --> 01:06:41,043
You go to town everyday. Ask them
if they'd help me get out of here.

584
01:07:13,994 --> 01:07:16,705
Have you got any plaster?

585
01:07:26,045 --> 01:07:29,345
What are you up to?

586
01:07:30,925 --> 01:07:33,475
What have you got there?

587
01:07:33,685 --> 01:07:37,645
We are allowed to take
food to the ghetto.

588
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:40,686
Three kilos of potato and bread.

589
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:42,986
Open it.

590
01:07:46,736 --> 01:07:51,746
- It's only potatoes and bread.
- You're lying. That's not true.

591
01:07:53,156 --> 01:07:55,326
Open it.

592
01:08:23,277 --> 01:08:25,487
Potatoes!

593
01:08:29,118 --> 01:08:32,158
You Jews are all alike.

594
01:08:32,368 --> 01:08:36,078
We reach you with a finger...

595
01:08:36,248 --> 01:08:39,288
and you take the whole hand.

596
01:08:52,599 --> 01:08:56,979
If you lie to me again,
I'll kill you. Personally.

597
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,250
I've tried your friends.

598
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:26,840
- They don't live there anymore.
- Did you make contact?

599
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:29,510
- Be ready to leave.
- When?

600
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,640
- Soon.
- Halt!

601
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:35,230
Shit! Shit!

602
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:38,101
Wait. What's going on here?

603
01:09:38,311 --> 01:09:41,981
Take this! Take this!

604
01:09:48,241 --> 01:09:52,281
I'll teach you some discipline,
you dirty Jews.

605
01:09:56,621 --> 01:09:59,001
Do you know why
you're being hit?

606
01:09:59,171 --> 01:10:02,342
- No.
- Do you know why you're being hit?

607
01:10:02,542 --> 01:10:07,092
- Why?
- To celebrate New Year.

608
01:10:09,382 --> 01:10:11,642
On the march!

609
01:10:11,972 --> 01:10:14,472
March and sing!

610
01:10:14,892 --> 01:10:16,642
Sing something nice!

611
01:10:17,392 --> 01:10:20,352
Loud and clear!

612
01:10:21,192 --> 01:10:25,192
Reunite tonight
And follow the white eagle

613
01:10:25,403 --> 01:10:29,533
Stand up and fight
Our mortal enemies

614
01:10:29,703 --> 01:10:33,583
Rise on the day
Let's give them fire and brimstone

615
01:10:33,743 --> 01:10:37,753
We'll do away
The Yoke of slavery

616
01:10:37,913 --> 01:10:41,713
Punish and rout
The rapists of our nation

617
01:10:41,883 --> 01:10:46,053
We'll slash them out
To save our dignity

618
01:11:19,705 --> 01:11:21,755
Come.

619
01:12:36,288 --> 01:12:37,998
I'm sorry.

620
01:12:38,208 --> 01:12:40,958
I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.

621
01:13:05,989 --> 01:13:08,949
We haven't much time.
Come on.

622
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:18,540
We must hurry.

623
01:13:18,670 --> 01:13:21,040
Here. See if this fit.

624
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:25,380
We have to keep moving you. Germans
are hunting down indiscriminately.

625
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:28,840
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.

626
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:32,970
You better shave.
Use my razor on the shelf.

627
01:13:47,861 --> 01:13:50,821
You'll be looked after
by Gebczynski.

628
01:13:51,031 --> 01:13:53,081
He's on the other side of town.

629
01:13:53,201 --> 01:13:57,081
You stay there tonight,
then we'll find you somewhere else.

630
01:13:57,541 --> 01:14:02,002
- I'll bring you food.
- Alright, let's go.

631
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:44,253
I'll show you where
you're going to sleep.

632
01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:17,585
You have to stay here
until tomorrow afternoon.

633
01:15:17,795 --> 01:15:22,715
We have a flat for you near
the ghetto wall. But it's safe.

634
01:15:30,015 --> 01:15:32,515
It's not going to be very comfortable.

635
01:15:33,055 --> 01:15:35,056
I'll be fine.

636
01:15:44,986 --> 01:15:47,156
Thank you.

637
01:16:02,587 --> 01:16:05,257
Here. Here. Give it to me.

638
01:16:05,927 --> 01:16:09,887
Go as near to the front as possible,
to the German section.

639
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:30,028
DO NOT PASS

640
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:03,899
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

641
01:17:09,409 --> 01:17:13,160
But you leave them open
during the day. Don't forget.

642
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:19,500
Must feel better on
this side of the wall, eh?

643
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:21,250
Yes.

644
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:27,090
But sometimes I'm still not sure
which side of the wall I'm on.

645
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:32,600
Some bread, potatoes, onions.

646
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:36,231
I'll come again.
Janina will visit you twice a week.

647
01:17:36,391 --> 01:17:38,901
To bring more food,
see how you are.

648
01:17:39,231 --> 01:17:41,401
Thank you.

649
01:17:43,691 --> 01:17:46,951
This is very important.
In case of emergency...

650
01:17:47,151 --> 01:17:51,451
I mean emergency,
go to this address.

651
01:18:33,993 --> 01:18:36,203
What do you mean you forgot?

652
01:18:36,373 --> 01:18:39,373
What do you think I mean?
I forgot, that's what I mean.

653
01:18:39,503 --> 01:18:45,093
- You know, you treat me like dirt.
- Because you are a dirt.

654
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:47,764
- Pig! Pig!
- Bitch!

655
01:18:47,964 --> 01:18:50,764
- Dirty pig!
- You are a dirty pig!

656
01:18:50,974 --> 01:18:53,684
Takes one to know one. Pig.

657
01:18:57,774 --> 01:19:02,604
- You play like an angel.
- Then why don't you listen?

658
01:19:02,774 --> 01:19:05,024
- I'm listening.
- Liar.

659
01:19:05,194 --> 01:19:08,534
You fell asleep. Pig.

660
01:19:29,885 --> 01:19:33,936
Spread out!
We're being attacked!

661
01:19:36,436 --> 01:19:38,856
Take cover!

662
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:41,526
Shoot!

663
01:19:53,616 --> 01:19:56,496
Take cover! Fire!

664
01:20:00,667 --> 01:20:03,467
Come on, get out!

665
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:33,311
The attack was successful.

666
01:21:35,311 --> 01:21:37,561
That building...

667
01:21:45,321 --> 01:21:47,401
Turn that way!

668
01:21:54,121 --> 01:21:56,041
Shoot!

669
01:22:20,273 --> 01:22:22,273
Thank you.

670
01:22:25,403 --> 01:22:28,653
- I wanted to come earlier, but...
- No, thank you.

671
01:22:32,743 --> 01:22:36,543
No-one thought
they'd hold out so long.

672
01:22:36,703 --> 01:22:39,253
I never should've come out. I should
have stayed and fought with them.

673
01:22:39,463 --> 01:22:42,923
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.

674
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:46,004
Just be proud of them.

675
01:22:46,214 --> 01:22:49,764
- My God, did they put up a fight!
- Yes.

676
01:22:51,804 --> 01:22:54,644
- So did the Germans.
- They are in shock!

677
01:22:54,854 --> 01:23:00,604
They didn't expect it. Nobody
expected it. Jews fighting back.

678
01:23:00,774 --> 01:23:05,614
- Who would have thought?
- What good did it do?

679
01:23:05,774 --> 01:23:07,825
What good?

680
01:23:08,035 --> 01:23:10,455
Wladek, I'm surprised with you.

681
01:23:10,615 --> 01:23:15,455
They died with dignity.
And you know something else?

682
01:23:16,335 --> 01:23:20,545
Now the Poles will rise.
We are ready.

683
01:23:20,755 --> 01:23:24,135
We'll fight too.
You'll see.

684
01:23:38,396 --> 01:23:41,066
Get your things together.
You have to leave.

685
01:23:41,276 --> 01:23:43,906
What? What's happened?

686
01:23:46,316 --> 01:23:48,616
- I'm on the run.
- What's happened?

687
01:23:48,826 --> 01:23:52,956
The Gestapo found our weapons.
They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

688
01:23:53,826 --> 01:23:57,707
They're bound to find out about this
place too. You must get away at once.

689
01:23:57,917 --> 01:24:00,337
Where do you want me to go?

690
01:24:00,507 --> 01:24:04,047
Look at me, I'm not leaving.

691
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:08,507
- Can I take my chances here?
- That's your decision.

692
01:24:08,677 --> 01:24:11,467
But when they storm the flat,
throw yourself out the window...

693
01:24:11,677 --> 01:24:13,517
don't let them get you alive.

694
01:24:13,687 --> 01:24:16,937
I have poison on me.
They won't get me alive either.

695
01:27:33,056 --> 01:27:35,356
Open up!

696
01:27:38,016 --> 01:27:42,356
Open the door
or we'll call the police!

697
01:28:10,267 --> 01:28:14,347
Are you from this flat?
You're not registered.

698
01:28:14,557 --> 01:28:17,808
It belongs to a friend of mine. I just
came to visit, but I missed him.

699
01:28:17,978 --> 01:28:20,438
Have you got your identity card?

700
01:28:21,068 --> 01:28:24,028
- Let me see your identity card.
- Yes, of course.

701
01:28:26,698 --> 01:28:29,198
- I want to see your identity card!
- What's happening?

702
01:28:29,408 --> 01:28:32,078
He's a Jew! A Jew!

703
01:28:32,288 --> 01:28:34,158
Stop the Jew!

704
01:28:35,168 --> 01:28:37,878
Don't let him out!
Stop him!

705
01:29:51,201 --> 01:29:55,452
- Yes?
- Mr. Gebczynski sent me.

706
01:30:01,582 --> 01:30:05,632
- Wladyslaw Szpilman.
- Dorota.

707
01:30:06,922 --> 01:30:08,932
Come in.

708
01:30:15,932 --> 01:30:17,523
I'm sorry.

709
01:30:17,733 --> 01:30:21,233
I was given this address and
I'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.

710
01:30:21,443 --> 01:30:25,113
Michal Dzikiewicz, he's my husband.

711
01:30:25,283 --> 01:30:27,033
Come in.

712
01:30:34,993 --> 01:30:37,003
Sit.

713
01:30:39,963 --> 01:30:42,334
I need help.

714
01:30:44,134 --> 01:30:47,054
He'll be back before curfew.

715
01:30:47,214 --> 01:30:49,844
I've been in hiding.

716
01:30:51,014 --> 01:30:54,554
- I need somewhere to stay.
- He'll be here soon.

717
01:30:56,724 --> 01:30:59,894
- How long have you been married?
- Just over a year.

718
01:31:02,694 --> 01:31:05,325
And how is Jurek?

719
01:31:05,525 --> 01:31:07,235
Dead.

720
01:31:13,915 --> 01:31:17,745
- When is your baby due?
- Christmas.

721
01:31:18,415 --> 01:31:22,215
This is not a good time to
have children, but then...

722
01:31:24,465 --> 01:31:27,925
This is my husband.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.

723
01:31:28,095 --> 01:31:32,936
- Marek Gebczynski sent him.
- Yes, I remember.

724
01:31:34,806 --> 01:31:37,516
He said to contact you
only in case of emergency.

725
01:31:37,726 --> 01:31:39,606
Don't worry now.

726
01:31:48,536 --> 01:31:52,787
We can't move you tonight.
You'll sleep on the sofa.

727
01:31:57,457 --> 01:31:59,297
Excuse me.

728
01:32:03,257 --> 01:32:06,297
I'm sorry,
could I have a piece of bread?

729
01:32:06,507 --> 01:32:09,257
Yes, of course.
We will eat.

730
01:32:09,927 --> 01:32:13,557
Sit. Please, sit.

731
01:32:13,767 --> 01:32:15,557
Thank you.

732
01:34:23,733 --> 01:34:26,783
You're on a very German area.

733
01:34:26,993 --> 01:34:31,413
On the opposite is a hospital taking
wounded from the Russian front.

734
01:34:33,283 --> 01:34:36,623
And next door is the
Schutzpolizei.

735
01:34:38,043 --> 01:34:40,374
Safest place to be.

736
01:34:40,584 --> 01:34:43,504
Right at the heart
of the lion's den.

737
01:34:48,594 --> 01:34:50,804
I'll be locking you in.

738
01:34:50,974 --> 01:34:55,014
No-one knows you're here,
so keep as quiet as possible.

739
01:37:04,610 --> 01:37:06,570
All well?

740
01:37:07,110 --> 01:37:09,410
Thank you.

741
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:17,460
This is Antek Szalas.
He'll be looking after you.

742
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:19,460
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

743
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:21,460
Thank you.

744
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:26,671
I've given him a second key. He'll
bring food, see that you're alright.

745
01:37:27,181 --> 01:37:29,801
He's with the underground,
he's a good man.

746
01:37:33,891 --> 01:37:38,101
- You don't remember me?
- I don't think so.

747
01:37:38,311 --> 01:37:41,821
Warsaw Radio.
I was a technician.

748
01:37:42,401 --> 01:37:45,571
I saw you almost everyday.

749
01:37:46,151 --> 01:37:49,612
- I'm sorry, I don't remember.
- It doesn't matter.

750
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:55,582
You've nothing to worry about.
I'll visit often.

751
01:37:56,412 --> 01:37:59,212
You'll be pleased to hear that
the Allies are bombing Germany...

752
01:37:59,372 --> 01:38:01,422
night after night,
after night.

753
01:38:01,632 --> 01:38:04,132
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.

754
01:38:04,382 --> 01:38:07,672
And the Russians are giving them
hell. It's the beginning of the end.

755
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:09,472
Let's hope so.

756
01:38:20,353 --> 01:38:22,563
Come here.

757
01:38:22,733 --> 01:38:24,943
Be careful with it.

758
01:38:25,863 --> 01:38:28,823
That's it. Be careful.

759
01:38:55,564 --> 01:38:58,434
Still alive then?

760
01:39:01,775 --> 01:39:05,945
Here. Sausage, bread.

761
01:39:06,155 --> 01:39:08,365
You still got that vodka?

762
01:39:22,715 --> 01:39:26,676
- How long is this meant to last?
- Not long now.

763
01:39:27,216 --> 01:39:30,386
I think I've got jaundice.

764
01:39:30,596 --> 01:39:34,436
Don't worry about that.
It just makes you look funny.

765
01:39:35,516 --> 01:39:39,566
My grandfather was jilted by
his girlfriend when he got jaundice.

766
01:39:39,776 --> 01:39:41,686
Drink up.

767
01:39:42,526 --> 01:39:45,566
Why didn't you come sooner?
It's been over two weeks...

768
01:39:45,776 --> 01:39:47,576
Problems.

769
01:39:47,776 --> 01:39:49,867
Money.

770
01:39:50,287 --> 01:39:52,907
I've got to raise money
to buy the food.

771
01:39:53,117 --> 01:39:56,997
I need things to sell,
it's not easy.

772
01:40:00,877 --> 01:40:03,547
Here. Sell this.

773
01:40:05,887 --> 01:40:08,097
Food is more important than time.

774
01:40:13,308 --> 01:40:16,438
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you!
The Allies have landed in France.

775
01:40:16,648 --> 01:40:18,938
Russians will be here soon.

776
01:40:19,398 --> 01:40:22,398
They'll beat the shit
out of the Germans...

777
01:40:23,238 --> 01:40:25,278
any day now.

778
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:11,240
Wladek?

779
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:23,590
I knew it.
I knew this would happen.

780
01:41:25,841 --> 01:41:28,181
- I'll get a doctor.
- You can't. It's too dangerous.

781
01:41:28,381 --> 01:41:32,061
- Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.
- Ridiculous. He's a pediatrician.

782
01:41:32,221 --> 01:41:34,681
- He's still a doctor.
- No.

783
01:41:34,891 --> 01:41:38,101
You stay. I'll go.

784
01:42:11,222 --> 01:42:14,063
We came to say goodbye.

785
01:42:14,263 --> 01:42:17,273
We're going to stay
with my mother in Otwocks.

786
01:42:17,483 --> 01:42:20,813
The baby is already there.
It's safer.

787
01:42:20,983 --> 01:42:25,113
There's talk that the uprising
will begin any day now.

788
01:42:26,403 --> 01:42:29,403
That man Szalas should be shot.

789
01:42:29,953 --> 01:42:34,123
He's been collecting money
on your behalf all over Warsaw.

790
01:42:34,913 --> 01:42:39,964
Apparently people gave generously,
so he collected a tidy sum.

791
01:42:44,294 --> 01:42:47,134
My God.

792
01:42:50,304 --> 01:42:55,644
The liver the size of a football.
Inflammation of the gall bladder...

793
01:42:56,314 --> 01:42:58,774
but he'll leave.

794
01:43:00,815 --> 01:43:05,065
I'll try to get him some laevulose,
but it's not easy.

795
01:43:05,275 --> 01:43:08,945
- Can you visit him again?
- Who knows.

796
01:43:09,155 --> 01:43:13,285
- Doctor, thank you.
- Don't speak, rest.

797
01:43:16,835 --> 01:43:19,415
Thank you so much for coming.

798
01:43:21,045 --> 01:43:23,296
We've brought you some food.

799
01:43:23,506 --> 01:43:27,346
I'll prepare something now
for you, then we must go.

800
01:44:08,927 --> 01:44:11,268
I'll throw a grenade!

801
01:44:19,518 --> 01:44:22,068
There's a wounded man over there!

802
01:44:22,568 --> 01:44:25,108
Come.

803
01:44:25,238 --> 01:44:27,658
Watch out! Watch out!

804
01:44:28,778 --> 01:44:31,738
- I'll go get help!
- Hurry!

805
01:44:32,408 --> 01:44:36,419
Come on! Bring the litter!

806
01:44:40,249 --> 01:44:42,879
Go back inside!

807
01:46:31,953 --> 01:46:34,624
Get out, get out in the streets!

808
01:46:34,834 --> 01:46:38,624
Get out now! The Germans
have surrounded the building!

809
01:47:19,705 --> 01:47:24,006
Somebody...
Somebody help me!

810
01:48:21,898 --> 01:48:25,068
Are you alright?
There's too much dust.

811
01:48:25,448 --> 01:48:30,028
I'll check this side.
Don't worry.

812
01:48:30,238 --> 01:48:32,699
Be careful!

813
01:48:38,129 --> 01:48:40,799
- Heinrich?
- I'm checking!

814
01:48:43,339 --> 01:48:45,879
Is there anybody here?

815
01:48:49,969 --> 01:48:54,099
- Come on down!
- Alright, I'm coming.

816
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:04,150
Come on, pile them up.

817
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:12,700
Throw it.

818
01:54:36,954 --> 01:54:39,914
We have to mark everything.

819
01:54:40,964 --> 01:54:41,924
Come on.

820
02:01:43,152 --> 02:01:45,532
What are you doing here?

821
02:01:49,992 --> 02:01:52,332
Who are you?

822
02:01:56,452 --> 02:02:00,042
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

823
02:02:02,132 --> 02:02:04,423
What are you doing?

824
02:02:10,183 --> 02:02:12,183
I was...

825
02:02:12,303 --> 02:02:15,393
trying to open this can.

826
02:02:16,063 --> 02:02:18,733
Do you live here?

827
02:02:21,153 --> 02:02:23,113
Do you work here?

828
02:02:23,313 --> 02:02:25,023
No.

829
02:02:28,704 --> 02:02:31,204
What do you do for a living?

830
02:02:34,244 --> 02:02:36,044
I am...

831
02:02:37,664 --> 02:02:40,674
I was a pianist.

832
02:02:42,754 --> 02:02:45,004
Pianist?

833
02:03:03,775 --> 02:03:05,775
Come.

834
02:03:30,726 --> 02:03:32,976
Play something.

835
02:08:52,180 --> 02:08:54,980
Are you hiding here?

836
02:08:59,730 --> 02:09:01,400
Jew?

837
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:06,820
Where are you hiding yourself?

838
02:09:08,450 --> 02:09:10,450
In the attic.

839
02:09:13,701 --> 02:09:16,041
Show it to me.

840
02:09:39,522 --> 02:09:41,812
Have you got anything to eat?

841
02:10:28,154 --> 02:10:33,744
According to them,
it's very important that...

842
02:10:40,464 --> 02:10:42,254
Attention!

843
02:10:43,964 --> 02:10:47,015
- At ease.
- At ease.

844
02:11:52,247 --> 02:11:54,247
Jew?

845
02:12:08,678 --> 02:12:10,138
Please.

846
02:12:10,558 --> 02:12:12,598
What does it mean,
all that shooting?

847
02:12:13,138 --> 02:12:15,898
The Russians,
on the other side of the river.

848
02:12:17,268 --> 02:12:20,728
You just have to hold on
a couple of weeks, not more.

849
02:13:52,242 --> 02:13:55,042
- What's going on?
- We're leaving.

850
02:13:57,963 --> 02:14:01,293
- Are the Russians here?
- Not yet.

851
02:14:04,213 --> 02:14:08,093
I don't know how to thank you.

852
02:14:09,553 --> 02:14:11,763
Thank God, not me.

853
02:14:12,183 --> 02:14:17,813
He wants us to survive. At least,
we have to believe in that.

854
02:14:27,654 --> 02:14:30,994
Here. Take it.

855
02:14:32,034 --> 02:14:36,334
- And you?
- I have another one. Warmer.

856
02:14:40,754 --> 02:14:44,344
What are you going to do
when this is over?

857
02:14:46,175 --> 02:14:50,515
I'll play piano again at
the Polish radio station.

858
02:14:51,385 --> 02:14:53,185
Tell me your name.

859
02:14:53,395 --> 02:14:56,065
Maybe I'll listen to you playing.

860
02:14:56,225 --> 02:14:58,355
Szpilman.

861
02:15:02,565 --> 02:15:05,445
Perfect name for a pianist.

862
02:16:27,699 --> 02:16:30,369
German! German!

863
02:16:53,520 --> 02:16:56,190
Don't shoot, I'm Polish!

864
02:16:57,190 --> 02:16:59,230
I'm Polish!

865
02:17:00,020 --> 02:17:02,730
- Come out with your hands up!
- Please! I beg of you!

866
02:17:03,440 --> 02:17:08,110
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
I beg you, I'm a Polish.

867
02:17:08,321 --> 02:17:10,331
Come down!

868
02:17:13,871 --> 02:17:18,001
Please, I'm Polish.
Please.

869
02:17:18,211 --> 02:17:20,381
He's Polish.

870
02:17:23,251 --> 02:17:25,511
Yes, he's Polish.

871
02:17:26,761 --> 02:17:29,221
Why the fucking coat?

872
02:17:30,301 --> 02:17:32,562
I'm cold.

873
02:17:51,572 --> 02:17:54,582
Look at them.
German fuckers!

874
02:17:55,122 --> 02:17:58,163
Murderers! Murderers!

875
02:17:58,413 --> 02:18:01,633
- Dirty bastards!
- Assassins!

876
02:18:01,833 --> 02:18:05,303
- Bastards!
- Look at you now!

877
02:18:05,463 --> 02:18:09,433
You took everything I had.
Me, a musician.

878
02:18:09,633 --> 02:18:13,053
You took my violin,
you took my soul.

879
02:18:17,933 --> 02:18:19,603
Musician?

880
02:18:20,814 --> 02:18:22,774
Are you a musician?

881
02:18:23,734 --> 02:18:25,904
Do you know...

882
02:18:26,234 --> 02:18:29,404
a pianist called Szpilman,
from the Polish radio station?

883
02:18:29,614 --> 02:18:34,834
- Of course I know him.
- I helped him to hide himself.

884
02:18:35,624 --> 02:18:37,754
Tell him I'm here.

885
02:18:38,544 --> 02:18:40,714
Ask him to help me.

886
02:18:43,795 --> 02:18:46,555
- What's your name?
- Hosenfeld.

887
02:18:46,805 --> 02:18:48,015
What?

888
02:20:30,079 --> 02:20:32,699
It was here, I'm certain of it.

889
02:20:34,709 --> 02:20:36,869
Well, it's not here now.

890
02:20:37,079 --> 02:20:41,209
I shouted, abused them. I'm not
proud of it, but that's what I did.

891
02:20:41,459 --> 02:20:42,880
I stood where you are now.

892
02:20:44,090 --> 02:20:47,430
There was a barbed wire
and this German came up to me.

893
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:52,430
- You didn't catch his name?
- No.

894
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:57,900
I'll ask at the factory.
They may know something.
