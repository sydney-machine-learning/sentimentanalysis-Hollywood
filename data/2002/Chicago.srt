1
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:36,578
5, 6, 7, 8

2
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:02,771
Anybody seen the Kelly Sisters?

3
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,276
You, you're up in 5.

4
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,577
- Keep the change, Charlie.
- Thanks.

5
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,346
Where the hell have you been?

6
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,474
- And where is Veronica?
- She's not herself tonight.

7
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,434
But they came to see your sister act.

8
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,397
Don't sweat it. I can do it alone.

9
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,665
Shit!

10
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:18,054
Come on! Move it! Hurry up!

11
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,100
Ladies and gentlemen,

12
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,187
the Onyx club is proud to present
Chicago's hottest dancing duo,

13
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,192
Two jazz babes moving as one.

14
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:35,155
The Kelly Sisters!

15
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,168
<i>* Come on babe *</i>

16
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:52,130
<i>* Why don't we paint the town? *</i>

17
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,215
<i>* And all that Jazz *</i>

18
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,217
<i>* I'm gonna rouge my knees *</i>

19
00:02:56,217 --> 00:03:00,263
<i>* And roll my stockings down *</i>

20
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,891
<i>* And all that jazz *</i>

21
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,142
<i>* Start the car *</i>

22
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,102
<i>* I know a whoopee spot *</i>

23
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,104
<i>* Where the gin is cold *</i>

24
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,981
<i>* But the piano's hot *</i>

25
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,150
<i>* It's just a noisy hall *</i>

26
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,361
<i>* Where there's a nightly brawl *</i>

27
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,654
<i>* And all *</i>

28
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,948
<i>* That *</i>

29
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:23,203
<i>* Jazz *</i>

30
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,750
<i>* And all that jazz *</i>

31
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:36,883
<i>* And all that jazz *</i>

32
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,154
<i>* Slick your hair *</i>

33
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:02,117
<i>* And wear your buckle shoes *</i>

34
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,576
<i>* And all that Jazz *</i>

35
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,453
<i>* I hear that Father Dip *</i>

36
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:09,290
<i>* Is gonna blow the blues *</i>

37
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,376
<i>* And all that Jazz *</i>

38
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,419
<i>* Hold on, hon *</i>

39
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,004
<i>* We're gonna bunny hug *</i>

40
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,089
<i>* I bought some aspirin *</i>

41
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,841
<i>* Down at United Drug *</i>

42
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,843
<i>* In case you shake apart *</i>

43
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,594
<i>* And want a brand new start *</i>

44
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,888
<i>* To do *</i>

45
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,682
<i>* that *</i>

46
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,893
<i>* Jazz *</i>

47
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,104
Let's go, babe.

48
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,441
But I didn't even meet your friend.
That manager guy.

49
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,777
Don't worry, Roxie.
It's all taken care of.

50
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,112
You told him about me?

51
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,322
Yeah, kid. It's all arranged.

52
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,574
<i>* Find a flask *</i>

53
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:46,411
<i>* We're playing fast and loose *</i>

54
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,288
<i>* And all that jazz *</i>

55
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,664
<i>* Right up here *</i>

56
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:53,418
<i>* Is where I store the juice *</i>

57
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,295
<i>* And all that jazz *</i>

58
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,546
<i>* Come on, babe *</i>

59
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,089
<i>* We're gonna brush the sky *</i>

60
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,758
<i>* I bet you luck Lindy *</i>

61
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,551
<i>* Never flew so high *</i>

62
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,428
<i>* 'Cause in the stratosphere *</i>

63
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,180
<i>* How could he lend an ear *</i>

64
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,599
<i>* to all *</i>

65
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,142
<i>* that *</i>

66
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:13,021
<i>* Jazz? *</i>

67
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:17,067
<i>* Oh, you're gonna see your *
* sheba shimmy shake *</i>

68
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,694
<i>* And all that jazz *</i>

69
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,656
<i>* Oh, she's gonna shimmy *
* 'till her garters break *</i>

70
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,159
<i>* And all that jazz *</i>

71
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,788
<i>* Show her where to park her girdle *</i>

72
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,249
<i>* Oh, her mother's blood'll curdle *</i>

73
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,835
<i>* If she'd hear her baby's queer *</i>

74
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,921
<i>* For all *</i>

75
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,589
<i>* that *</i>

76
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,677
<i>* jazz *</i>

77
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,141
- Hello, Miss Borusewicz.
- Mrs. Hart.

78
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,269
This is Fred.

79
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,815
He's my brother.

80
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,358
<i>* All *</i>

81
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,943
<i>* that *</i>

82
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:03,905
<i>* jazz *</i>

83
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,742
<i>* Come on, babe *</i>

84
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,744
<i>* Why don't we paint
* the town? *</i>

85
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,872
<i>* And all that jazz *</i>

86
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,541
<i>* I'm gonna *
* rouge my knees *</i>

87
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,418
<i>* And roll my *
* stockings down *</i>

88
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,838
<i>* And all that jazz *</i>

89
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,089
<i>* Start the car *</i>

90
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,966
<i>* I know a whoopee spot *</i>

91
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,551
<i>* Where the gin is cold *</i>

92
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,302
<i>* But the piano's hot *</i>

93
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,762
<i>* It's just a noisy hall *</i>

94
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,639
<i>* Where there's a nightly brawl *</i>

95
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,850
<i>* And all *</i>

96
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,601
<i>* that *</i>

97
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,395
<i>* jazz *</i>

98
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,564
Say it again, Frank.

99
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,149
You're a star, kid.

100
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:43,111
My little shooting star!

101
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,448
<i>* No, I'm no one's wife, but *</i>

102
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,659
<i>* Oh, I love my life *</i>

103
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:53,121
<i>* And all *</i>

104
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:57,167
<i>* that *</i>

105
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,338
<i>* Yeah *</i>

106
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:05,300
<i>* That Jazz! *</i>

107
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,888
Say it again, Fred.

108
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:13,975
Jesus.

109
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:17,187
Hey, where's the fire?

110
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:21,274
Amos ain't home till midnight.

111
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,236
Freddie?

112
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:29,199
Fred?

113
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,496
Hey, you know,

114
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,498
I don't want you to feel like
I'm nagging at you or anything,

115
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:40,543
but don't you think it's about time
that I met your friend down at the Onyx?

116
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:45,548
I mean, it's been a month
since you told him about me.

117
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,468
I know.

118
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,430
'Cause that was the night Velma Kelly,
plugged her husband and her sister.

119
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:57,227
You know, they say that she
found them in the kip together.

120
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,812
Gosh, if I ever found

121
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,897
Amos soapin' it to somebody else...

122
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,400
Boy, I'd throw him a party.

123
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,237
- A big, big going away party.
- It's getting late.

124
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,114
I have been thinking a lot
about my act, though.

125
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:13,076
Whenever I get a good idea, I write it down
in my diary before it goes out of my head.

126
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,452
And you know what occurred to me?

127
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,121
The other day... that...

128
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,623
all the really really knock-out acts

129
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,252
have something a little different
going on, you know?

130
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:29,259
Like, a signature band.
And I thought my thing could be..

131
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,470
"aloof"... you know?

132
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,181
Give them just enough
to get them good and hungry

133
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:39,269
but always leave them wanting more.

134
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,646
Once I get a name for myself, maybe

135
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,691
maybe we can open up
a club of our own, you know?

136
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,694
You could run it,
and I could be the headliner.

137
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,196
- Oh, get off.
- What's the idea?

138
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,867
Wake up, kiddo, you ain't
never gonna have an act.

139
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:54,993
Says who?

140
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:58,663
Face it, Roxie.
You're a two-bit talent with skinny legs.

141
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,206
And I'm just a furniture salesman.

142
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,752
Yeah, but you got connections, you know.
That guy down at the club...

143
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:04,919
There's no guy.

144
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,254
Yeah, that night...

145
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,048
It was the first time
I set foot in that joint.

146
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,967
I was collecting on a bet
from the trombone player.

147
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,179
So you never told anyone about me?

148
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,681
Sugar, you are hot stuff.

149
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:20,560
I would have said anything
to get a piece of that.

150
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,645
So now what?... Now?

151
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,857
We had some laughs.
Let's just leave it at that.

152
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,525
Fred...

153
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,488
You can't do this to me.

154
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:35,575
You get off!

155
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,706
You touch me again,
I'll put your lights out.

156
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,626
- Wait...
- Your husband will be home soon,

157
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,462
why don't you wash yourself before
you go hitting those sheets again.

158
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:50,382
- You're a liar, Fred.
- Oh, yeah, so what?

159
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:54,219
You lied to me...

160
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,055
That's life, sweetheart. That's life.

161
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:01,017
You son of a bitch...
You son of a bitch!

162
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,696
You son of a bitch!

163
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,543
Why are you bothering, Sal?
This one's all wrapped up.

164
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,545
I hear it's a new city record.

165
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,339
From killing to confession
in an hour flat.

166
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,008
Why did you get the murder weapon?

167
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,801
I keep a gun in the underwear drawer.

168
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,303
Just in case of trouble, you know.

169
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,015
That's just fine.
Sign right there, Mr. Hart.

170
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,392
Freely and gladly.
Freely and gladly.

171
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,228
And mind you don't say we beat it out of you
when you get up on the witness stand.

172
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,565
No, I give myself up.
Surrendered of my own free will.

173
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,985
- Isn't he the cheerful murderer!
- Shooting a burglar ain't murder.

174
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,862
Just last week a jury thanked a man.

175
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:56,364
I'm always grateful
for citizens who know the law.

176
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,450
Get in there.

177
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,452
You too.

178
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,080
Sit down.

179
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:09,419
Okay, from the top.

180
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,339
A man has got a right to protect
his home and his loved ones, right?

181
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,798
Of course he has.

182
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,761
I come home from the garage,
and I see him climbing through the window.

183
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:21,181
With my wife Roxie laying there,
sleeping like an angel.

184
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,557
Is that true, Mrs. Hart?

185
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,560
I'm telling you, it's the God's honest truth.
My wife has nothing to do with it.

186
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,188
She won't hurt a worm.
Not even a worm.

187
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,941
It wasn't until I fired the first shot,
then she even opened her eyes.

188
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:36,404
Boy she's some heavy sleeper, I always said she
could sleep through the St. Patty's day parade.

189
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,949
When I think of what would have happened
if I went out for a beer with the guys

190
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,618
instead of coming straight home...

191
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,329
It makes me sick
even to think about it...

192
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,831
<i>For her first number, Miss Roxie Hart</i>

193
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,168
<i>would like to sing a song
of love and devotion.</i>

194
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:54,130
<i>Dedicated to her dear husband, Amos.</i>

195
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,093
<i>* Sometimes I'm right *</i>

196
00:11:58,093 --> 00:12:00,595
<i>* Sometimes I'm wrong *</i>

197
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,640
<i>* But he doesn't care *</i>

198
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,185
<i>* He'll string along *</i>

199
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,605
<i>* He loves me so *</i>

200
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:14,693
<i>* That funny honey of mine *</i>

201
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,615
<i>* Sometimes I'm down *</i>

202
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,660
<i>* Sometimes I'm up *</i>

203
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,620
<i>* But he follows 'round *</i>

204
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,582
<i>* Like some droopy-eyed pup *</i>

205
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,545
<i>* He love me so *</i>

206
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:37,090
<i>* That funny honey of mine *</i>

207
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,592
Like I said, even after I shot him,
he kept coming at me.

208
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,678
So I had to pull the trigger again.

209
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,180
<i>* He ain't no sheik *</i>

210
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,474
<i>* That's no great physique *</i>

211
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,645
<i>* And Lord knows *
* he ain't got the smarts *</i>

212
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,941
<i>* But look at that soul *</i>

213
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,235
<i>* I tell you that whole *</i>

214
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:00,238
<i>* Is a whole lot greater *</i>

215
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:04,743
<i>* Than the sum of his parts *</i>

216
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:11,082
<i>* And if you knew him like me *</i>

217
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:16,629
<i>* I know you'd agree *</i>

218
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,132
<i>* What if the world *</i>

219
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,135
<i>* Slandered my name? *</i>

220
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,180
<i>* Why he'd be right there *</i>

221
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,099
<i>* Taking the blame *</i>

222
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:32,145
<i>* He loves me so *</i>

223
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:38,109
<i>* And it all suits me fine *</i>

224
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,615
<i>* That funny sunny honey *</i>

225
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,702
<i>* Hubby of mine *</i>

226
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:51,873
I mean suppose if... just suppose that
he had violated her or something.

227
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,208
You know what I mean, violated?

228
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,250
I know what you mean.

229
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,753
Or something.
Think how terrible that would have been.

230
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,129
It's good thing I got home from work
on time.

231
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:01,132
<i>* He loves me so *</i>
- I'm telling you that.

232
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:05,011
<i>* That funny honey of mine *</i>
- I say I'm telling you that.

233
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,097
Name of deceased: Fred Casely.

234
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:08,640
Fred Casely?

235
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,602
How could he be a burglar? My wife
knows him. He sold us our furniture.

236
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,813
He gave us 10% off.

237
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:19,067
<i>* Lord knows he ain't got the smarts *</i>

238
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,195
- She told me he was the burglar!
- You mean he was dead when you got home?

239
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:26,700
I'm covering the sheet and she's telling
me some cock'n'bull story about this burglar.

240
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,619
And how I ought to say I did it
'cause I was sure to get off.

241
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,539
"Help me, Amos." she says,
"It's my goddamn hour of need."

242
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,624
<i>* Now he shot off his trap *</i>

243
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,961
<i>* I can't stand that sap *</i>

244
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,629
<i>* Look at him go! *</i>
- And I believed her,

245
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,424
<i>* Ranting on me! *</i>
- That cheap little tramp.

246
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,926
<i>* With just one more brain *</i>
- So she was two-timing me, huh?

247
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,263
<i>* What a half-wit he'd be! *</i>
- Well I'm through protecting her now...

248
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:51,516
<i>* If they string me up *</i>
- I'm on the garage with my butt 14 hours a day.

249
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,476
<i>* Well I'll know who ... *</i>
- And she's up there munching on bonbons,

250
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,521
And tramping around
like some goddamn floozy!

251
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,398
Thought she could pull the wool
over my eyes, eh?

252
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,858
<i>* That scummy... *</i>
- I wasn't born yesterday.

253
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,235
<i>* crummy... dummy... *</i>
- I tell you that some things a man just can't take.

254
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,112
<i>* Hubby of mine. *</i>
- And this time she pushed me too far.

255
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:08,199
I didn't shoot him.
Boy what a sap I was!

256
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:12,162
You double-crosser!
You big blabber-mouth!

257
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,247
- You promised you'd stick...
- What're you talking about?

258
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,790
You've been sticking me, Roxanne!

259
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,667
- Stop it!
- You told me it's a burglar!

260
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,336
- The whole time you've been jazzing him.
- Goddamn it!

261
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:23,298
You are a disloyal husband!

262
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,677
Look, it's true. I shot him.

263
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,597
But it was self-defense.
He was trying to burgle me.

264
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:34,684
From what I hear, he's been burglin' you
three times a week for the last month.

265
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,395
So what do you say, Missus?

266
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,981
- That's him, all right.
- Thank you.

267
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,192
Your story doesn't wash, Mrs. Hart.

268
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,069
So try this on for size.

269
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:47,197
Fred Casely was a good time on the
side, with Goofy here as a meal ticket.

270
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,325
Meal ticket?
He couldn't buy my liquor.

271
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,659
And Fred Casely could?

272
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,664
With a wife and five little Caselys?
Or did he forget to mention them.

273
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,670
- What?
- All his.

274
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,965
That bastard! That bastard!

275
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,760
Yeah, I killed him.
And I would kill him again!

276
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,722
Once was enough, deary.
Take her downtown. Come on.

277
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,310
Here they come!

278
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,478
This way, honey.

279
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,980
Oh, come on. It's a shame
to hide such a beautiful face.

280
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,023
Why'd you shoot him?

281
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,026
Why don't you give us a profile, with a little
smile like the girl from the toothpaste ad?

282
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,862
Enjoy it while you can.
Take this down.

283
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,573
Assistant District Attorney Harrison
says this is a hanging case.

284
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,450
- Hanging?
- I'm ready to go to the jury tomorrow.

285
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,744
- What do you mean hanging?
- Not so confident anymore, are you?

286
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,830
Take her down to the Cook County Jail.

287
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,289
Come on, sweetie. Headline.
What did you shoot him?

288
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:42,127
Was he cruel to you? Did he beat you?
Was he foolin' around?

289
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:46,089
Hey, what do you mean hanging?

290
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,441
Morphine, opium, cocaine?

291
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:08,403
Arm length: 31inches...

292
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:17,495
The matron's on her way.
So don't get too cozy.

293
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:22,167
Put off that cigarette!

294
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:27,589
Ever had Morton before?

295
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,385
She's fine...

296
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:36,473
as long as you keep her happy.

297
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,601
And now, ladies and gentlemen.

298
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:43,021
The keeper of the keys,
the countess of the clink,

299
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,523
the mistress of murderers' row...

300
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:49,486
Matron Mama Morton!

301
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:02,415
<i>* Ask any of the chickies in my pen *</i>

302
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:07,420
<i>* They'll tell you I'm *
* the biggest mother hen *</i>

303
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:12,967
<i>* I love them all and *
* all of them love me *</i>

304
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,679
<i>* Because the system works *</i>

305
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,058
<i>* The system called reciprocity... *</i>

306
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:28,400
On your feet.

307
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,068
Welcome, ladies.

308
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,779
<i>* Got a little motto *</i>

309
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,573
<i>* Always sees me through *</i>

310
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,076
<i>* When you're good to Mama *</i>

311
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,578
<i>* Mama's good to you. *</i>

312
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,415
You might think I'm here
to make your life a living hell.

313
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,291
It's just not true.

314
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,211
<i>* There's a lot of favors *</i>

315
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,922
<i>* I'm prepared to do *</i>

316
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:53,633
<i>* You do one for Mama *</i>

317
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,428
<i>* She'll do one for you. *</i>

318
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,430
I'd be your friend if you let me.

319
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,724
So if there's something
that upsets you or

320
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,018
makes you unhappy in any way,

321
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:06,146
don't shoot your fat-ass mouth off on me
'cause I won't give a shit. Now move it out.

322
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,940
<i>* They say that life is tit for tat *</i>

323
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,651
<i>* And that's the way I live *</i>

324
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,571
<i>* So, I deserve a lot of tat *</i>

325
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:17,282
<i>* For what I've got to give *</i>

326
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:20,118
<i>* Don't you know that this hand *</i>

327
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:23,121
<i>* Washes that one too *</i>

328
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,749
<i>* When you're good to Mama *</i>

329
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:29,711
<i>* Mama's good to you. *</i>

330
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,010
Let's go!

331
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,304
You must be Hart.

332
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,598
Ain't you the pretty one?

333
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,809
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Oh, no, call me Mama.

334
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,312
I'm gonna take care of you.

335
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,731
Now, you'd be happy taken down
in the East block.

336
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,483
Murderers' Row, we call it.

337
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:52,859
Oh?

338
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,821
Is that nicer?

339
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:07,749
I don't think I really belong in here.
I didn't actually do anything wrong.

340
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:10,669
No need to tell me, honey.
I never heard of a man getting killed,

341
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:13,171
when he didn't get
just what was coming to him.

342
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:16,216
Hey, mama. Come here.

343
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,176
Velma Kelly?

344
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:21,513
You're the Velma Kelly?

345
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:24,849
You know I was there that night?
I was there the night that you got arrested.

346
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,812
Yeah, you and half of Chicago.
Look at this, Mama.

347
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:32,357
An editorial denouncing me
in Redbook magazine.

348
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:36,319
"Not in memory do we recall
so fiendish and horrible a double homicide."

349
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,947
Baby you couldn't
buy that kind of publicity.

350
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:42,909
Couldn't buy it?

351
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,912
I guess I can keep this then.

352
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,997
Nice try.

353
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,917
<i>* If you want my gravy *</i>

354
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,545

370
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:46,931
<i>* I could bring this number to? *</i>

371
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:51,394
<i>* When you're good to Mama *</i>

372
00:21:51,519 --> 00:22:03,198

373
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:11,331
Mama? It's... kinda...

374
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,083
freezing in here.

375
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,127
You don't think maybe there's
something wrong with the heat?

376
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:19,547
Not that I'm complaining,
but... you know...

377
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:23,510
If you've got a couple of
extra blankets tucked away...

378
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:30,100

430

You know how people have
these little habits that get you down?

431
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:00,667
Like, Bernie.
Bernie liked to chew gum.

432
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,878
No, not chew. Pop.

433
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:06,923
So I came home this one day,
and I'm really irritated.

434
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:09,009
And I'm looking for
a little bit of sympathy.

435
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:11,720
And there's Bernie, lying on the couch,

436
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,263
drinking a beer and chewing.

437
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:16,516
No, not chewing. Popping!

438
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:17,976
So I said to him,

439
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:21,938
"You pop that gum one more time..."

440
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,107
And he did.

441
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,401
So I took the shotgun off the wall and

442
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:29,654
I fired two warning shots...

443
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:33,199
into his head.

444
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:37,037
<i>* He had it coming *</i>

445
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,790

00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:48,506
<i>* I betcha you would *
* Have done the same! *</i>

449
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:59,059
I met Ezekiel Young from
Salt Lake City about two years ago.

450
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:03,021
And he told me he was single.
And we hit it off right away.

451
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:04,898
So we started living together.

452
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,983
He'd go to work.
He'd come home.

453
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:09,778
I'd fixed him a drink.
We did dinner.

454
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:12,405
And then I found out.

455
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:15,950
Single, he told me. Single my ass!

456
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,870
Not only he was married,
oh no.

457
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,955
He has 6 wives.

458
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:23,458
One of those Mormons,
you know.

459
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,960
So that night when he
came home from work,

460
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,923
I fixed him his drink,
as usual.

461
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,094
You know some guys just
can't hold their arsenic.

462
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:37,305
<i>* He had it coming *</i>

463
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:41,810
<i>* He took a flower *
* In its prime *</i>

464
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,895
<i>* And then he used it *</i>

465
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:45,855
<i>* And he abused it *</i>

466
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:46,815
<i>* It was a murder *</i>

467
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:50,443
<i>* But not a crime! *</i>

468
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,320
Now I'm standing in the kitchen.

469
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,988
Carving up a chicken for dinner

470
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,990
minding my own business.

471
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,202
In storms my husband
Wilbur in a jealous rage.

472
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:00,995
"You've been screwing
the milkman?" he says.

473
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,455
He was crazy.

474
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:05,875
And he kept on screaming,
"You've been screwing the milkman!"

475
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:08,378
And then he ran into my knife.

476
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:12,465
He ran into my knife 10 times.

477
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,051
<i>* If you'd have been there *</i>

478

480

[Hungarian]
What am I doing here?

481
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:26,021
They say, the famous
Hungarian Police,

482
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:30,066
that I killed my husband.

483
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:34,237
But I didn't do it. I'm not guilty.

484
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:38,533
I can't believe that
Uncle Sam says I'm guilty.

485
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:42,579
They say I did it, but really I...

486
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:43,955
Yeah, but did she do it?

487
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:47,917
Uh-uh!
Not guilty!

488
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,674
My sister Veronica
and I had this double act.

489
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:57,510
And my husband Charlie
traveled around with us.

490
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:01,348
Now for the last number in our act
we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row.

491
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:03,016
1- 2 - 3 - 4

492
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:05,101
5 - Split - Spread eagles

493
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:08,146
Back flips - Flip-flops...
One right after the other.

494
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:12,108
So this one night before the show,
we were down at the Hotel Cicero.

495
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:16,154
The three of us boozin',
havin' a few laughs.

496
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:19,908
And we ran out of ice.
So I go out to get some.

497
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:23,370
I come back. Open the door.

498
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:27,332
And there's Veronica and Charlie,
doing number 17:

499
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,669
the spread eagle!

500
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:33,254
Well, I was in such a state of shock.

501
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:36,591
I completely blacked out.
I can't remember a thing.

502
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,677
It wasn't until later,

503
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:42,764
when I was washing the blood off my hands,
I even knew they were dead!

504
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:46,601
<i>* They had it coming *</i>

<i>* How could you tell me *

514
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:18,425
I loved Al Lipschitz more than
I could possibly say.

515
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:20,510
He was a real artistic guy.

516
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,221
Sensitive. A painter.

517
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:25,598
But he was always
trying to find himself.

518
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:29,477
He'd go out every night
looking for himself and on the way...

519
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,021
he found Ruth,

520
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,188
Gladys,

521
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,523
Rosemary,

522
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:34,774
and Irving.

523
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:38,236
I guess you could say we broke up
because of artistic differences.

524
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:40,530
He saw himself as alive.

525
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,450
And I saw him dead.

526
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:50,123
<i>* The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum *</i>

527
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:54,085
<i>* They had it comin' *</i>

528
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:57,505
<i>* They had it comin' *
* All along *</i>

529
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,382
<i>* 'Cause if they used us *</i>

530
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,259
<i>* And they abused us *</i>

531
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:04,804
<i>* How could you tell us *
* that we were wrong? *</i>

532
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:08,683
<i>* He had it coming *</i>

533
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:12,312
<i>* He only had himself to blame. *</i>

534
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:13,980
<i>* If you'd have been there *</i>

535
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,857
<i>* If you'd have seen it *</i>

536
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:18,985
<i>* I betcha you would *
* have done the same! *</i>

537
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:21,488
- You pop that gum one more time...
- Single my ass!

538
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:23,281
Ten times

539
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:25,867
- Number 17, the spread eagle
- Artistic differences

540
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:27,869
<i>* Pop *</i>

541
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,829

542
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,831

543
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:33,792

544
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,877
<i>* Cicero *</i>

545
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:39,839
<i>* Lipschitz! *</i>

546
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:45,887
Who belongs to them?

547
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:48,181
- What's it to you?
- Nothing.

548
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:50,058
Heard they were Velma's.

549
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:54,020
Yeah, the Hunyak does
all her laundry for a buck a week.

550
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:05,198
Fresh towels for the can.

551
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:09,244
Make it quick.

552
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,538
...I'm gonna take care
of you now.

553
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:14,040
I'm working on a couple
of things now, let me ask.

554
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,334
Now, Billy Flynn set
your trial day for March 5th.

555
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:18,211
March 7th, you'll be acquitted.

556
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:21,131
On March 8th, you know
what Mama's gonna do for you?

557
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:24,050
Mama's gonna put you back
on the Vaudeville circle.

558
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,218
So now you're an agent too?

559
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:28,013
Well deary, until Ma Bell
installs a private line in your cell

560
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:29,597
all your calls are
gonna go through me.

561
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:31,683
What kind of dough
are we talking about?

562
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:33,143
You know, it's a crazy world.

563
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:37,105
I mean, Babe Ruth is wearing rouge
and playing a palace for $5,000 a week.

564
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,816
Yeah. And what about
someone with real talent?

565
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,736
Well, I can talk to the boys
over at William Morris.

566
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,404
And due to your
recent sensational activities,

567
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:46,906
they seem to think
they can get you $2,500.

568
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:50,952
$2,500? Geez, the most
me and Veronica made was $350.

569
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:53,580
Yeah, well, that's what happens when you
have the right presentation.

570
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,831
You know what, Mama?

571
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:57,834
I always wanted to play
Big Jim Colosimo's.

572
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,711
Do you think
you can get me that?

573
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,296
- Big Jim's?
- Yeah.

574
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:04,299
Geez, I don't know.
It's gonna take another phone call.

575
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:06,092
And how much is that gonna cost?

576
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:08,386
Oh, come on, Vel.
You know how I feel about you.

577
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:11,306
You're like family to me.
You're like one of my own.

578
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:15,352
- I'll do it for 50 bucks.
- 50 bucks for a phone call?

579
00:32:15,352 --> 00:32:19,314
You must get
a lot of wrong numbers, Mama.

580
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:26,112
Oh, Miss Kelly.
That's your personals.

581
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,781
Freshly pressed by yours truly.

582
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:31,117
No, no. It's my pleasure.

583
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:34,871
Hey, listen.
Can I ask you something?

584
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:37,040
You know that Harrison guy?

585
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,917
He said that what
I done is a hanging case

586
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:42,379
and that he's prepared to ask
for the maximum penalty.

587
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:43,505
Yeah? So?

588
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:47,592
So, I'm scared.
I sure would appreciate some advice.

589
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:51,763
Especially from
someone I admire as much as you.

590
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:54,557
You see, since I can remember,
I have wanted to be on the stage.

591
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:57,811
Really? What's your talent?
Washing and drying?

592
00:32:57,811 --> 00:33:00,939
- No. I dance in the chorus.
- Oh.

593
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:04,776
- That was before I met my husband Amos.
- Look, honey, you want some advice?

594
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:07,070
Here it is, direct from me to you.

595
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:11,032
Keep your paws
off my underwear, okay?

596
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:16,246
Yeah, okay.

597
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:18,665
Thanks...

598
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:21,251
for nothin'.

599
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:22,919
She's somethin', ain't she?

600
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:26,798
I tell you, no matter how big she gets,
she's still as common as ever.

601
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:30,760
I'd like to help you, deary.

602
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:33,972
Take a load off.

603
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:38,059
So, what do you
figure on using for grounds?

604
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:39,310
What do you mean grounds?

605
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,645
What are you gonna tell the jury?

606
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:42,647
I figure I'd tell them the truth.

607
00:33:42,647 --> 00:33:44,607
- The truth?
- Yeah.

608
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:46,192
That's a one way ticket
to the death house.

609
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:47,652
Holy mother of God.

610
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:51,614
Relax. I mean, in this town,
murder is a form of entertainment.

611
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:55,660
Besides, in 47 years Cook County
ain't never hung a woman yet.

612
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:57,746
So the odds are 47 to 1...

613
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:00,999
- that they won't hang you.
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

614
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:04,961
You're talking to the wrong people.
What you need, is Billy Flynn.

615
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,255
- Who?
- Billy Flynn.

616
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:10,175
He's only the best
criminal lawyer in all of Illinois.

617
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:12,552
I'm telling you. What he don't know
about juries and women.

618
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:14,012
How do you get this Billy Flynn?

619
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:16,014
Well, not by prayin', dearie.

620
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:19,142
First, you give me a hundred dollars.
Then I'll make a phone call.

621
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:21,436
A hundred dollars?
Well you just...

622
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:25,190
I mean, it seems
pretty steep for a phone call.

623
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,359
Oh, but he's worth every cent.

624
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,695
He's never lost a case
for a female client yet.

625
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:33,615
And with a sweet little puss
like yours, well...

626
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:36,117
Let's just say justice
ain't so blind in Chicago.

627
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:38,953
- He's never lost a case?
- Never.

628
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:42,916
Every girl in this place would kill
to have Billy Flynn represent her.

629
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:52,384

Good morning, ladies.

660
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:53,546
Not guilty!

661
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:57,425
You tell him, sweetheart.

662
00:36:57,425 --> 00:37:01,471
<i>* That's what he's here for *</i>

663
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:07,018
Excuse me, gentlemen. Miss Kelly, do you
remember anything at all about that night?

664
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:09,938
I passed out completely, Miss Sunshine.
I can't remember a thing.

665
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:11,398
Only that I didn't do it.

666
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:12,732
Any idea who did, dear?

667
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:15,360
No. But my client is offering
a substantial reward

668
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,320
to anyone with information
about this crime.

669
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,905
How much is the reward, Miss Kelly?

670
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:21,616
- I don't know. How much?
- We'll work it out after the trial.

671
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:25,662
Now, if there are no more questions,
Miss Kelly and I have a lot of work to do.

672
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:30,041
What's all this about a reward?

673
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:33,086
Awfully dumb reporters. They write it up wrong,
you deny the whole thing later on.

674
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:35,588
- Thank you!
- One more question...

675
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,674
<i>* All he cares about is love *</i>

676
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:40,885
- Mr. Flynn, I'm Roxie Hart.
- Who?

677
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:42,470
Mama talked to you about me.

678
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,014
Oh, yeah. Right.
The cute one.

679
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:46,307
I was hoping that
you might represent me.

680
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:49,144
You have $5,000?

681
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:51,646
Gee. That's a lot of money.

682
00:37:51,646 --> 00:37:53,815
Mama didn't say anything
about $5,000.

683
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:57,152
Lookit, Mr. Flynn.

684
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:59,154
I'm not very good at
this sort of thing, but...

685
00:37:59,154 --> 00:38:01,322
Maybe we could...

686
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:04,868
make some sort of
arrangement between us.

687
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:07,162
And I can be an awfully good sport.

688
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:08,538
Good, you got that
out of your system.

689
00:38:08,538 --> 00:38:09,998
Now listen,

690
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:12,292
you mean just one thing to me.

691
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:14,794
You call me when you've got $5,000.

692
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:17,714
<i>* All he cares about is love *</i>

693
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:21,468
<i>* Show me long Raven hair *</i>

694
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:24,679
<i>* Flowin' down, 'bout to there *</i>

695
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,765
<i>* When I see her *</i>

696
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:29,059
<i>* Runnin' free *</i>

697
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:33,021
<i>* Keep your money, *
* that's enough for me *</i>

698
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:39,194
<i>* I don't care for drivin' Packard cars *</i>

699
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:43,239
<i>* Or smoking Long Buck Cigars *</i>

700
00:38:43,656 --> 00:38:46,159
<i>* No, no, not me *</i>

701
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,161
<i>* All I care about is *</i>

702
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:50,121
<i>* Doin' the guy in *</i>

703
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:52,123
<i>* Who's pickin', on you *</i>

704
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:53,875
<i>* Twistin' the wrist *</i>

705
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:57,837
<i>* That's turnin' the screw *</i>

706
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:03,176
<i>* All I care about *</i>

707
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:14,729
<i>* is love! *</i>

708
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:24,114
Oh, he'll see you now.

709
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:28,076
Hello, Andy.

710
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:29,953
Amos, my name is Amos.

711
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:33,623
That's right. Take a seat.

712
00:39:33,623 --> 00:39:36,543
- You know, you're a remarkable man.
- Huh?

713
00:39:36,543 --> 00:39:39,963
Your wife two-times you.
Plugs the guy and tries to pin it on you.

714
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:42,590
Most men would let a dame
like that swing, but no,

715
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,842
you're sticking by her.

716
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,385
Makes you a hero in my eyes.

717
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:48,096
That's right. I'm a hero.

718
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:50,807
Did you bring the money?

719
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:53,643
I didn't do as well
as I hoped. But,

720
00:39:53,643 --> 00:39:57,605
I will, Mr. Flynn.
I will.

721
00:39:58,106 --> 00:39:59,482
This is only a thousand.

722
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:02,902
Plus this $300 I borrowed
from the guys down at the garage,

723
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:05,113
and there's 7...

724
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:07,615
$700 from the
Building and Loan Fund.

725
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:09,284
$2,000

726
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:11,244
And that's all I got so far.

727
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:14,080
But I'll give you $20
off my salary every week.

728
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,957
I'll give you notes with interest.

729
00:40:15,957 --> 00:40:17,834
Double, triple,
until every cent is paid, I promise.

730
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:20,545
When you came to me yesterday,
I didn't ask if she was guilty.

731
00:40:20,545 --> 00:40:21,796
I didn't ask if she was innocent.

732
00:40:21,796 --> 00:40:24,799
I didn't ask if she was a drunk,
or a dope fiend. No.

733
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:27,093
All I said was, Do you have $5,000?

734
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:30,347
You said yes!
But you don't have $5,000!

735
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:34,309
So I figure you're a dirty liar
and I don't waste my time with dirty liars.

736
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:42,025
Look...

737
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:44,944
I'm real sorry, Mr. Flynn.

738
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:48,907
On the other hand, your devotion
to your wife is really very touching.

739
00:40:50,241 --> 00:40:52,035
I'll take your wife's case.

740
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:55,997
And I'll keep it.
Because I play square.

741
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:58,583
Now look, Hart.

742
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:01,711
I don't like to blow my
own horn. But believe me.

743
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:05,799
If Jesus Christ had lived in Chicago today
and if he had $5,000 and he'd come to me,

744
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:09,636
things would have turned out differently.

745
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:11,513
All right,
this is what we're gonna do.

746
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:12,972
By the end of the week,
I'm gonna have Roxie's name

747
00:41:12,972 --> 00:41:15,266
on the front page of
every newspapers in town.

748
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:18,937
Sweetest little jazz killer
ever to hit Chicago.

749
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:20,897
That's the angle I'm after.

750
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:23,316
You make an announcement,
we're gonna have an auction.

751
00:41:23,316 --> 00:41:25,402
Tell them we gotta raise
some money for the defense.

752
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:28,738
They'll buy everything
she's ever touched. Everything.

753
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:31,324
Your shoes, your dresses,
your perfume, your underwear.

754
00:41:31,324 --> 00:41:32,701
And the Victrola records.

755
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:35,286
Like the one I was playing
when I shot the bastard.

756
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:36,329
I didn't hear that!

757
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:39,249
Not that I didn't have "grounds",
mind you. Hey, what are they?

758
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:43,003
That's when we go to trial. Look, nobody's
gonna care a lick what your defense is

759
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:44,671
unless they care about you.

760
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:47,382
So first thing we gotta do is work up
some sympathy from the press.

761
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:50,010
And they're not all pushovers
like Mary Sunshine, but

762
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,303
There is one thing
that they can never resist.

763
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:56,349
And that is a reformed sinner.

764
00:41:56,474 --> 00:41:56,975
So tell me,

765
00:41:56,975 --> 00:42:00,854
- What was your favorite subject in school?
- Oh, I was a real dummy.

766
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:02,605
There must be something
that you were really good at.

767
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:05,108
I got high marks in
Courtesy and Hygiene.

768
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:09,195
- Perfect, you wanted to be a nun.
- A nun?

769
00:42:09,195 --> 00:42:12,115
- Where were you born?
- On a chicken farm outside of Lubbock.

770
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:15,035
Beautiful southern home,
filled with every luxury and refinement.

771
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:16,161
Where are your parents now?

772
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:18,788
Probably on the front porch
in their rocking chairs.

773
00:42:18,788 --> 00:42:20,040
Parents dead.

774
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,793
Family fortune swept away.
You were educated at the Sacred Heart.

775
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:25,962
Then you fell into a runaway marriage.

776
00:42:25,962 --> 00:42:28,256
Left you miserable, alone, unhappy.

777
00:42:28,256 --> 00:42:30,967
And of course you got all swept up
in the mad whirl of this city.

778
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:32,969
Jazz, cabarets, liquor.

779
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:35,138
- You were drawn like a moth to the flame.
- A moth?

780
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:37,557
And now the mad whirl has ceased,

781
00:42:37,557 --> 00:42:41,311
and you are a butterfly,
crushed on the wheel!

782
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:43,813
So which is it?
Is it the moth or the butterfly?

783
00:42:43,813 --> 00:42:47,859
- You have sinned and you're sorry.
- God, that's beautiful.

784
00:42:48,818 --> 00:42:52,572
Cut out God.
Stay where you're better acquainted.

785
00:42:52,572 --> 00:42:56,326
Kid, when I'm through with you,
not only will you be acquitted,

786
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:59,746
but every man on that jury
will wanna take you home to meet his mother.

787
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:02,582
I was born on
a beautiful southern convent.

788
00:43:02,582 --> 00:43:04,042
What?

789
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:05,585
Oh, holy shit!

790
00:43:05,585 --> 00:43:07,379
Oh, I'm never gonna
get this straight!

791
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:10,298
Pipe down the swearin'.
Look, from here on in,

792
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:13,009
you say nothing rougher than "Oh damn".
Now try it again.

793
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:17,055
- I was born on...
- Come on...

794
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:47,002
You know what are some more things
to do on the witness stand?

795
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:50,964
I thought I'd get all teary-eyed
and ask for your handkerchief.

796
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:54,175
Then I thought I'd take a peek
at the jury like this.

797
00:43:54,175 --> 00:43:57,303
Flashin' a bit of thigh, heh?
What do you think?

798
00:43:57,303 --> 00:44:01,391
Sounds great.

799
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:05,979
Hey, don't you want
to hear the rest?

800
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:09,816
Tomorrow, kiddo.
You're at the top of my list.

801
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:11,401
Well, well, well.

802
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:14,821
Sorry to be late, Mr. Flynn.

803
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:17,532
Hope you aren't too bored.

804
00:44:17,532 --> 00:44:25,457
I like it.

805
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:27,876
Hey, Pollyanna.

806
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:30,253
I heard your
press conference is tomorrow.

807
00:44:30,253 --> 00:44:32,047
Yeah, what's it to you?

808
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:34,007
Well, you wanted my advice, right?

809
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:35,592
Well, here it is.

810
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:39,554
Don't forget Billy Flynn's
number-one client is Billy Flynn.

811
00:44:40,388 --> 00:44:42,974
Meaning what?

812
00:44:42,974 --> 00:44:46,936
Meaning,
don't let him hug the spotlight.

813
00:44:47,145 --> 00:44:51,107
You're the one they pay to see.

814
00:44:53,526 --> 00:44:55,612
Remember, we can only sell them
one idea at a time.

815
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:58,740
I can still see him coming at me
with that awful look in his eyes.

816
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,783
And?

817
00:44:59,783 --> 00:45:01,743
And we...
both reached for the gun.

818
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:03,828
That's right,
you both reached for the gun.

819
00:45:03,828 --> 00:45:07,791
- Ready?
- Yeah.

820
00:45:16,966 --> 00:45:19,386
Good day gentlemen, gentlemen,
Miss Sunshine.

821
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:21,680
My client has just
entered a plea of not guilty.

822
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,057
We look forward to a trial
at the earliest possible date.

823
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:28,019
Now are there any questions?

824
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:30,230
Miss Sunshine.

825
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,566
As you know, my paper is dry.
Do you have any advice for young girls,

826
00:45:33,566 --> 00:45:35,944
seeking to avoid
a life of jazz and drink?

827
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:39,906
Absolutely yes. Mrs. Hart feels
that it was the tragic combination of liquor

828
00:45:39,906 --> 00:45:43,034
and jazz, which lead to her downfall.
Next question, please.

829
00:45:43,034 --> 00:45:44,411
Ladies and gentlemen,

830
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:47,747
I would just like to say how flattered
I am that you all came to see me.

831
00:45:47,747 --> 00:45:48,998
Mrs. Hart is very pleased...

832
00:45:48,998 --> 00:45:51,793
You see, I was a moth...
crushed on the wheel.

833
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:55,880
You know, a butterfly,
drawn to the...

834
00:45:57,007 --> 00:46:00,760
I bet you want to know why
I shot the bastard.

835
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,596
Shut up, dummy.

836
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:06,307
Mr. Billy Flynn in the
Press Conference Rag.

837
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:08,268
Notice how his mouth never moves...

838
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:10,353
almost.

839
00:46:10,353 --> 00:46:11,604
Where'd you come from?

840
00:46:11,604 --> 00:46:14,024
<i>* Mississippi *</i>

841
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:15,358
And your parents?

842
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:17,569
<i>* Very wealthy. *</i>

843
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:18,820
Where are they now?

844
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,363
<i>* Six feet under. *</i>

845
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:22,157
<i>* But she was granted one more start *</i>

846
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:26,119
<i>* The convent of The Sacred Heart! *</i>

847
00:46:31,124 --> 00:46:32,876
<i>* When'd you get here? *</i>

848
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:34,753
<i>* 1920 *</i>

849
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:36,629
<i>* How old were you? *</i>

850
00:46:36,629 --> 00:46:38,214
<i>* Don't remember *</i>

851
00:46:38,214 --> 00:46:39,966
<i>* Then what happened? *</i>

852
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:41,634
<i>* I met Amos *</i>

853
00:46:41,634 --> 00:46:43,303
<i>* And he stole my heart away *</i>

854
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:45,597
<i>* Convinced me to *
* elope one day *</i>

855
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:48,933
Oh, you poor dear, I can't believe
what you've been through.

856
00:46:48,933 --> 00:46:51,227
A convent girl,
a runaway marriage.

857
00:46:51,227 --> 00:46:52,479
Now tell us Roxie.

858
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:54,272
<i>* Who's Fred Casely? *</i>

859
00:46:54,272 --> 00:46:55,940
<i>* My ex-boyfriend. *</i>

860
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,609
<i>* Why'd you shoot him? *</i>

861
00:46:57,609 --> 00:46:59,361
<i>* I was leavin'. *</i>

862
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:01,029
<i>* Was her angry? *</i>

863
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:02,697
<i>* Like a madman *</i>

864
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:04,574
<i>* Still I said: Fred, move along. *</i>

865
00:47:04,574 --> 00:47:06,576
<i>* She knew that she was doin' wrong. *</i>

866
00:47:06,576 --> 00:47:08,244
<i>* Then describe it. *</i>

867
00:47:08,244 --> 00:47:09,913
<i>* He came toward me. *</i>

868
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:11,664
<i>* With the pistol? *</i>

869
00:47:11,664 --> 00:47:13,333
<i>* From my bureau. *</i>

870
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:15,001
<i>* Did you fight him? *</i>

871
00:47:15,001 --> 00:47:16,795
<i>* Like a tiger. *</i>

872
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:18,880
<i>* He had strength and
she had none. *</i>

873
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,049
<i>* And yet we both *
* reached for the gun *</i>

874
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:22,425
<i>* Oh yes, oh yes, *
* oh yes we both *</i>

875
00:47:22,425 --> 00:47:23,468
<i>* Oh yes we both *</i>

876
00:47:23,468 --> 00:47:24,511
<i>* Oh yes, we both *
* reached for *</i>

877
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,054
<i>* The gun, the gun, *
* the gun, the gun *</i>

878
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:27,222
<i>* Oh yes, we both *
* reached for the gun *</i>

879
00:47:27,222 --> 00:47:28,264
<i>* For the gun *</i>

880
00:47:28,264 --> 00:47:29,808
<i>* Oh yes, oh yes, *
* oh yes they both *</i>

881
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:30,850
<i>* Oh yes, they both *</i>

882
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:31,810
<i>* Oh yes, they both *
* reached for *</i>

883
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,478
<i>* The gun, the gun, *
* the gun, the gun, *</i>

884
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:34,813
<i>* Oh yes, they both *
* reached for the gun *</i>

885
00:47:34,813 --> 00:47:36,189
<i>* for the gun. *</i>

886
00:47:36,189 --> 00:47:40,151
<i>* Understandable. *
* Understandable. *</i>

887
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:44,614
<i>* Yes, it's perfectly *
* understandable *</i>

888
00:47:45,156 --> 00:47:49,119
<i>* Comprehensible. Comprehensible *</i>

889
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:52,956
<i>* Not a bit reprehensible *</i>

890
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:56,918
<i>* It's so defensible! *</i>

891
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:01,423
<i>* How're you feeling? *</i>

892
00:48:01,423 --> 00:48:03,299
<i>* Very frightened *</i>

893
00:48:03,299 --> 00:48:05,051
<i>* Are you sorry? *</i>

894
00:48:05,051 --> 00:48:06,845
<i>* Are you kidding? *</i>

895
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:08,596
<i>* What's you're statement? *</i>

896
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:10,056
<i>* All I'd say is *</i>

897
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:11,850
<i>* Though my choo-choo *
* jumped the track *</i>

898
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,810
<i>* I'd give my life *
* to bring him back *</i>

899
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,603
<i>* - And? *</i>
<i>* - Stay away from *</i>

900
00:48:15,603 --> 00:48:17,480
<i>* - What? *</i>
<i>* - Jazz and liquor *</i>

901
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,232
<i>* - And? *</i>
<i>* - And the men who *</i>

902
00:48:19,232 --> 00:48:20,400
<i>* - What? *</i>
<i>* - Play for fun *</i>

903
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,694
<i>* - And what? *</i>
<i>* - That's the thought that *</i>

904
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:24,446
<i>* - Yeah *</i>
<i>* - Came upon me *</i>

905
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:27,782
<i>* - When? *</i>
<i>* - When we both reached for the gun! *</i>

906
00:48:27,907 --> 00:48:31,953
<i>* Understandable, understandable *</i>

907
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:36,332
<i>* Yes, it's perfectly *
* understandable *</i>

908
00:48:36,958 --> 00:48:40,920
<i>* Comprehensible, comprehensible *</i>

909
00:48:41,254 --> 00:48:44,883
<i>* Not a bit reprehensible *</i>

910
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:49,054
<i>* It's so defensible! *</i>

911
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:58,563
<i>* Oh yes, oh yes, *
* oh yes, they both *</i>

912
00:48:58,646 --> 00:49:00,648
<i>* Oh yes, they both *</i>

913
00:49:00,648 --> 00:49:03,443
<i>* Oh yes, they both *
* reached for *</i>

914
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:04,402
Let me hear it!

915
00:49:04,402 --> 00:49:06,154
<i>* The gun, the gun, *
* the gun, the gun *</i>

916
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:07,197
<i>* Oh yes, they both *</i>

917
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:08,365
<i>* Reached for the gun *</i>

918
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:09,282
<i>* For the gun *</i>

919
00:49:09,282 --> 00:49:10,241
A little louder!

920
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:12,410
<i>* Oh yes, oh yes, *
* oh yes, they both *</i>

921
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,453
<i>* Oh yes, they both *</i>

922
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:14,913
<i>* Oh yes, they both *
* reached for *</i>

923
00:49:14,913 --> 00:49:16,581
<i>* The gun, the gun, *
* the gun, the gun *</i>

924
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:17,624
<i>* Oh yes. They both *</i>

925
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:18,458
<i>* Reached for the gun *</i>

926
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:19,834
<i>* For the gun *</i>

927
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:21,920
<i>* Oh yes, oh yes, *
* oh yes, they both *</i>

928
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,837
<i>* Oh yes, they both *</i>

929
00:49:22,837 --> 00:49:24,089
<i>* Oh yes, they both *
* reached for *</i>

930
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:25,965
<i>* The gun, the gun, *
* the gun, the gun *</i>

931
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:27,634
<i>* Oh yes, they both *
* reached for the gun. *</i>

932
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:28,885
<i>* For the gun *</i>

933
00:49:28,885 --> 00:49:30,970
<i>* Oh yes, oh yes, *
* oh yes, they both *</i>

934
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:31,930
<i>* Oh yes, they both *</i>

935
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,181
<i>* Oh yes, they both *
* reached for *</i>

936
00:49:33,181 --> 00:49:37,143
<i>* The gun, the gun, *
* the gun, the gun... *</i>

937
00:49:39,938 --> 00:49:55,578
<i>* Both reached for the... gun *</i>

938
00:50:02,377 --> 00:50:03,712
Move over Al Capone,

939
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:06,840
The windy city has taken
a new criminal to its height.

940
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,884
The name on everybody's lips is,
Roxie Hart.

941
00:50:09,884 --> 00:50:13,013
The sweetest little lady ever accused
of murder in Chicago.

942
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:16,349
Women want to look like her.
Fellows want to go out with her.

943
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:18,643
Some little girls
even want to take her home.

944
00:50:18,643 --> 00:50:21,021
Don't get any ideas,
little lady.

945
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:23,940
On the other side of town,
the assistant D. A. promises

946
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,610
the gay little sharp-shooter
will swing before the year is up.

947
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:29,696
Who knows?
If he lives up to his word,

948
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:33,658
Assistant D. A. Harrison might
become Governor Harrison some day.

949
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,952
Back at the scene of the crime,

950
00:50:35,952 --> 00:50:39,914
everybody wants
a little piece of Roxie Hart.

951
00:50:39,914 --> 00:50:43,960
This jar of cold cream set
her husband back 20 dollars!

952
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,922
Maybe this pretty little lady will get
some of that famous Roxie style.

953
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:51,259
It seems everybody these days
is rooting for...

954
00:50:51,259 --> 00:50:55,221
Roxie Hart.

955
00:50:55,972 --> 00:50:59,934
Take those wilted flowers over to the orphanage
and make sure they know who sent them.

956
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:02,937
So, kiddo,

957
00:51:02,937 --> 00:51:05,857
Given it any thought of what you
wanna do after Billy gets you off?

958
00:51:05,857 --> 00:51:08,360
Yeah, I think I'd like to go
on the stage.

959
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:12,113
Yeah, I figured as much.
I already called the Morris office.

960
00:51:12,113 --> 00:51:15,158
Really?
How much is that gonna cost me?

961
00:51:15,158 --> 00:51:18,495
A fair deal.
10% of all your takings.

962
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:20,372
Yeah, well. We'll see, Mama.

963
00:51:20,372 --> 00:51:23,166
Besides, I don't even
have an act yet.

964
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:25,168
Killing Fred Casely
was your act.

965
00:51:25,168 --> 00:51:28,588
That's all those stiffs in the audience want.
To say they saw somebody famous.

966
00:51:28,588 --> 00:51:30,173
It's a freak act.

967
00:51:30,465 --> 00:51:34,135
And besides, I am better than that.

968
00:51:34,135 --> 00:51:36,638
Of course you are, cupcake.

969
00:51:36,638 --> 00:51:38,807
I mean, you can be as big
as Sophie Tucker.

970
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:40,058
You really think so?

971
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:41,851
Bigger than Kanther
and Juleson combined.

972
00:51:41,851 --> 00:51:45,397
You know, I've always wanted to
have my name in all the papers.

973
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:49,359
Before I met Amos, I used to date
this well-to-do, ugly bootlegger.

974
00:51:49,859 --> 00:51:52,904
He used to take me out
and show me off.

975
00:51:52,904 --> 00:51:56,950
Ugly guys like to do that.

976
00:51:57,909 --> 00:51:59,661
Once it said in the paper,

977
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:04,666
"Gangland's Al Capelli seen at
Chez Vito with cute blonde corinne."

978
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,293
That was me.

979
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:10,296
I clipped and I saved it.

980
00:52:10,296 --> 00:52:14,384
You know all my life,
I wanted to have my own act.

981
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:17,178
But, no...

982
00:52:17,178 --> 00:52:19,472
It's always no,
they always turn me down.

983
00:52:19,472 --> 00:52:22,100
One big world full of no.

984
00:52:24,811 --> 00:52:28,857
And then Amos came along.

985
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:32,944
Safe, sweet Amos.

986
00:52:33,236 --> 00:52:37,198
Who never says no.

987
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:42,412
I've never done this before.

988
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:44,706
But you know,
it is such a special night

989
00:52:44,706 --> 00:52:48,793
and you are such
a great audience!

990
00:52:48,877 --> 00:52:50,128
And...

991
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:54,090
I really feel like
I can talk to you, you know?

992
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:57,844
So forget what
you've read in the papers.

993
00:52:58,053 --> 00:53:00,555
And forget what
you've heard on the radio.

994
00:53:00,555 --> 00:53:02,557
Because...

995
00:53:02,557 --> 00:53:06,186
because I'm gonna tell you the truth.

996
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:10,273
Not that the truth really matters.

997
00:53:10,565 --> 00:53:14,110
But I'm gonna tell you anyway.

998
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:18,198
In the apartment,
Amos was...

999
00:53:19,949 --> 00:53:22,369
zero.

1000
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:26,331
I mean, when he made love to me,
it goes like...

1001
00:53:26,414 --> 00:53:29,334
It was like he was
fixing a carburetor or something.

1002
00:53:29,334 --> 00:53:33,296
I love you, honey...

1003
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:36,341
Anyway,

1004
00:53:36,341 --> 00:53:39,344
I started foolin' around.

1005
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:41,346
Then I started screwin' around.

1006
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:43,431
Which is... fooling around

1007
00:53:43,431 --> 00:53:46,559
without dinner.

1008
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,270
Then I met Fred Casely.

1009
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:52,816
Who said that he could
get me into Vaudeville.

1010
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:56,861
But that didn't quite
work out like I planned.

1011
00:53:56,861 --> 00:54:00,824
I guess it didn't really work out
too great for Fred either.

1012
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:03,326
So I gave up
on the whole Vaudeville idea.

1013
00:54:03,326 --> 00:54:07,288
'Cause if you can't figure
after all these years,

1014
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:10,333
opportunities just pass you by.

1015
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:12,002
<i>* But it ain't *</i>

1016
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:16,047
<i>* Oh no, no, no, no. *
* But it ain't *</i>

1017
00:54:16,589 --> 00:54:20,552
And now,
with this Flynn guy,

1018
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:22,512
with all these publicity,

1019
00:54:22,512 --> 00:54:25,557
I got me a world full of yes!

1020
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:29,310
<i>* The name on everybody's lips *</i>

1021
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:31,062

<i>* Is gonna be *</i>

1025
00:54:38,361 --> 00:54:40,030
<i>* Roxie *</i>

1026
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:42,657
<i>* I'm gonna be a celebrity *</i>

1027
00:54:42,657 --> 00:54:46,703
<i>* That means somebody *
* everyone knows *</i>

1028
00:54:47,328 --> 00:54:50,248
<i>* They're gonna recognize my eyes *</i>

1029
00:54:50,248 --> 00:54:54,210
<i>* My hair, my teeth, *
* my boobs, my nose *</i>

1030
00:54:58,506 --> 00:55:02,135
<i>* From just some dumb *
* mechanic's wife *</i>

1031
00:55:02,135 --> 00:55:03,720
<i>* I'm gonna be *</i>

1032
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,680
<i>* Roxie *</i>

1033
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:11,936

1034
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:15,815

1035
00:55:15,815 --> 00:55:19,778

1036
00:55:21,654 --> 00:55:25,700
<i>* Roxie Hart! *</i>

1037
00:55:43,426 --> 00:55:45,845
Boys?

1038
00:55:45,845 --> 00:55:49,391
<i>* They're gonna wait *
* outside in line *</i>

1039
00:55:49,391 --> 00:55:50,934
<i>* To get to see *</i>

1040
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:53,144
<i>* Roxie *</i>

1041
00:55:53,144 --> 00:55:56,898
<i>* Think of those autographs I'll sign *</i>

1042
00:55:56,898 --> 00:55:58,358
<i>* Good luck to you, *</i>

1043
00:55:58,358 --> 00:56:00,110
<i>* Roxie *</i>

1044
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,612
<i>* And I'll appear in a lavaliere *</i>

1045
00:56:02,612 --> 00:56:06,700
<i>* That goes all the way *
* down to my waist *</i>

1046
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,077
<i>* Here a ring, there a ring *</i>

1047
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:10,662
<i>* Everywhere a ring a ling *</i>

1048
00:56:10,662 --> 00:56:14,708
<i>* But always in the best of taste *</i>

1049
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:19,629
Oooh... I'm a star.

1050
00:56:19,629 --> 00:56:22,549
And the audience loves me.

1051
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:25,051
And I love them.

1052
00:56:25,051 --> 00:56:27,345
And they love me for loving them.

1053
00:56:27,345 --> 00:56:31,099
And I love them for loving me.

1054
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:35,061
And we love each other.

1055
00:56:35,061 --> 00:56:39,107
And that's 'cause none of us
got enough love in our childhoods.

1056
00:56:39,232 --> 00:56:42,986
And that's show biz.

1057
00:56:42,986 --> 00:56:45,905
Kid.

1058
00:56:45,905 --> 00:56:49,325
<i>* She's giving up here humdrum life *</i>

1059
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:51,202
<i>* I'm gonna be *</i>

1060
00:56:51,202 --> 00:56:52,871
<i>* Roxie. *</i>

1061
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:58,710
<i>* She made a scandal and a start. *</i>

1062
00:56:58,918 --> 00:57:02,881
<i>* And Sophie Tucker *
* will shit, I know *</i>

1063
00:57:02,881 --> 00:57:06,843
<i>* To see her name *
* get billed below *</i>

1064
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:12,807
<i>* Roxie Hart! *</i>

1065
00:57:13,641 --> 00:57:17,687
<i>* Roxie *</i>

1066
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:41,670
I just can't take it anymore.

1067
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:45,632
I can't go anywhere without hearing
about that dumb tomato!

1068
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:51,262
Oh, Mama, not you too.

1069
00:57:51,262 --> 00:57:53,765
I have some bad news, kid.
The tour has been cancelled.

1070
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:54,808
What?

1071
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:56,685
Your name has been
out of the papers too long.

1072
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:59,396
All you read about today,
is that Hart kid.

1073
00:57:59,396 --> 00:58:02,857
She's hot.

1074
00:58:02,857 --> 00:58:05,443
And what am I supposed to do?

1075
00:58:05,443 --> 00:58:08,154
Suck up to her like everybody else?

1076
00:58:08,154 --> 00:58:09,531
It couldn't hurt.

1077
00:58:09,531 --> 00:58:12,659
Over my dead body.

1078
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:16,287
Mind if I join you?

1079
00:58:16,287 --> 00:58:18,915
Lights out, 10 minutes.

1080
00:58:18,915 --> 00:58:22,877
Smoke?

1081
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:25,463
Look what some Johnny sent me.

1082
00:58:25,463 --> 00:58:29,426
Triple-cream caramels,
all the way from San Francisco.

1083
00:58:30,468 --> 00:58:34,431
I'm watching my figure.
You know, the trial.

1084
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:40,270
Hey, great mention of you
in the Trib' today, huh?

1085
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:44,232
There have been so many,
I just can't keep track.

1086
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:50,196
Hey, did I ever tell you?
You're exactly same size as my sister.

1087
00:58:50,196 --> 00:58:53,116
I mean, you'd fit into
her costumes perfectly.

1088
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:54,367
Really?

1089
00:58:54,367 --> 00:58:55,827
Yeah, and I was thinking, you know,

1090
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:59,873
with all the publicity that's piled up
between us, and when Billy gets us off,

1091
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:03,001
we'd be a natural
to do an act together.

1092
00:59:03,001 --> 00:59:06,963
You think so, huh?

1093
00:59:08,548 --> 00:59:10,717
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1094
00:59:10,717 --> 00:59:13,553
<i>Miss Velma Kelly in Act...</i>

1095
00:59:13,553 --> 00:59:15,430
<i>of Desperation.</i>

1096
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:19,392
<i>* My sister and I had an act *
* that couldn't flop *</i>

1097
00:59:20,101 --> 00:59:24,064
<i>* My sister and I were headed *
* straight for the top *</i>

1098
00:59:25,106 --> 00:59:28,985
<i>* My sister and I earned a *
* thou' a week at least *</i>

1099
00:59:28,985 --> 00:59:30,236
<i>* Oh, yeah! *</i>

1100
00:59:30,236 --> 00:59:34,282
<i>* But my sister is now, *
* unfortunately, deceased *</i>

1101
00:59:35,533 --> 00:59:37,619
<i>* I know it's sad, of course *</i>

1102
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:38,870
<i>* But a fact *</i>

1103
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:41,915
<i>* is still a fact *</i>

1104
00:59:41,915 --> 00:59:44,417
<i>* And now all that remains *</i>

1105
00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:46,711
<i>* Is the remains *</i>

1106
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:48,588
<i>* Of a perfect *</i>

1107
00:59:48,588 --> 00:59:50,256
<i>* double *</i>

1108
00:59:50,256 --> 00:59:52,842
<i>* act! *</i>

1109
00:59:52,842 --> 00:59:55,261
Watch this.

1110
00:59:55,261 --> 00:59:59,307
Now you have to imagine it with 2 people.
It's swell with 2 people.

1111
00:59:59,516 --> 01:00:03,603
<i>* First I'd... *</i>

1112
01:00:03,603 --> 01:00:07,565
<i>* Then she'd... *</i>

1113
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:11,611
<i>* Then we'd... *</i>

1114
01:00:11,611 --> 01:00:14,239
<i>* But I can't do it alone! *</i>

1115
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:18,284
<i>* Then she'd... *</i>

1116
01:00:18,618 --> 01:00:22,247
<i>* Then I'd... *</i>

1117
01:00:22,247 --> 01:00:26,209
<i>* Then we'd... *</i>

1118
01:00:26,209 --> 01:00:28,628
<i>* But I can't do it alone! *</i>

1119
01:00:28,628 --> 01:00:31,548
<i>* She'd say, *
* "What's your sister like?" *</i>

1120
01:00:31,548 --> 01:00:33,925
<i>* I'd say, "Men," *</i>

1121
01:00:33,925 --> 01:00:36,761
<i>* She'd say, *
* "You're the cat's meow" *</i>

1122
01:00:36,761 --> 01:00:38,930
<i>* Then we'd wow the crowd again *</i>

1123
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:43,018
<i>* When she'd go... *</i>

1124
01:00:43,518 --> 01:00:47,397
<i>* I'd go... *</i>

1125
01:00:47,397 --> 01:00:51,359
<i>* We'd go... *</i>

1126
01:00:53,319 --> 01:00:56,573
<i>* Then those ding-dong daddies *
* started to roar *</i>

1127
01:00:56,573 --> 01:00:59,284
<i>* Whistled, stomped, *
* stamped on the floor *</i>

1128
01:00:59,284 --> 01:01:02,704
<i>* Yelling, screaming, *
* begging for more. *</i>

1129
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:06,249
<i>* And we'd say, "O. K. fellas, *
* keep your socks up. *</i>

1130
01:01:06,249 --> 01:01:10,211
<i>* 'cause you ain't seen *
* nothin' yet!" *</i>

1131
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:20,347
<i>* But I simply cannot do it *</i>

1132
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:23,892
<i>* alone! *</i>

1133
01:01:23,892 --> 01:01:26,394
So what do you think, huh?

1134
01:01:26,394 --> 01:01:30,357
Come on, you can say.

1135
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:36,404
I know you're right.
The first part is shit.

1136
01:01:36,404 --> 01:01:37,655
But the second part...

1137
01:01:37,655 --> 01:01:41,701
The second part is really nifty.

1138
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:46,414
<i>* She'd go... *</i>

1139
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,962
<i>* I'd go... *</i>

1140
01:01:55,173 --> 01:01:59,135
<i>* We'd go... *</i>

1141
01:02:07,686 --> 01:02:11,231
<i>* And then those two-bit Johnnies
did it a brown *</i>

1142
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:13,942
<i>* To cheer the best *
* attraction in town *</i>

1143
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:17,070
<i>* They nearly tore the balcony down *</i>

1144
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:18,947
<i>* And we'd say. "Okay, boys... *</i>

1145
01:02:18,947 --> 01:02:23,618
<i>* we're goin' home, but before we go *
* here's a few more partin' shots!" *</i>

1146
01:02:24,369 --> 01:02:25,078
<i>* And this... *</i>

1147
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:29,040
<i>* this we did in perfect unison. *</i>

1148
01:02:36,047 --> 01:02:38,842
<i>* Now, you've seen me goin' through it *</i>

1149
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:41,469
<i>* It may seem there's nothin' to it *</i>

1150
01:02:41,469 --> 01:02:46,266
<i>* But I simply cannot do it *</i>

1151
01:02:46,766 --> 01:02:52,605
<i>* Alone! *</i>

1152
01:02:54,816 --> 01:02:58,778
So where's the part
where you blew her brains out?

1153
01:02:58,862 --> 01:03:00,655
Okay, Roxie. I'll...
I'll level with you...

1154
01:03:00,655 --> 01:03:02,615
No, don't bother.

1155
01:03:02,615 --> 01:03:05,869
You think you're fooling me?
You're all washed up.

1156
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:09,831
And it's me they want now,
and I'm a big star.

1157
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:12,000
Single.

1158
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,962
Oh, I almost forgot.
You were in the paper today too.

1159
01:03:16,713 --> 01:03:19,632
In the back.
With the obituaries.

1160
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:23,678
Velma Kelly's trial has been
postponed indefinitely.

1161
01:03:26,514 --> 01:03:30,477
Seven words. Wow.

1162
01:03:32,562 --> 01:03:35,273
Oh! And here's a little
piece of advice.

1163
01:03:35,273 --> 01:03:37,359
Direct from me to you.

1164
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:41,404
Lay off the caramels.

1165
01:03:49,954 --> 01:03:52,999
And now, for all you
Chicago's stay-up-laters.

1166
01:03:52,999 --> 01:03:56,211
You night owls who
only come alive after dark,

1167
01:03:56,211 --> 01:03:59,673
We dedicate this tune:

1168
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:03,635
Chicago After Midnight.

1169
01:04:07,597 --> 01:04:11,559
This all took place in Lake Shore Drive?

1170
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:15,105
Incredible.

1171
01:04:15,105 --> 01:04:19,067
All right. Thanks.

1172
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:22,404
They just arrested this woman
for triple homicide.

1173
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:23,321
Really?

1174
01:04:23,321 --> 01:04:26,366
Yeah, get this. She's an heiress.

1175
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:28,535
And all her family is in the...

1176
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:31,454
pineapples... grapefruit, some
kind of fruit, I don't know.

1177
01:04:31,454 --> 01:04:34,791
Anyhow, this dame, Kitty
what's her name, something...

1178
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:36,668
She's playing house.

1179
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:40,213
On the north side in an apartment,
with a guy named Harry.

1180
01:04:40,213 --> 01:04:42,507
What Harry does for living,
no one's quite sure.

1181
01:04:42,507 --> 01:04:45,552
But it doesn't really matter because
she's footing all the bills. Anyhow...

1182
01:04:45,552 --> 01:04:49,514
Kitty comes home tonight.
Harry's already in bed,

1183
01:04:49,514 --> 01:04:53,476
She goes to change. When she returns,
she notices something...

1184
01:04:54,185 --> 01:04:57,439
rather odd.

1185
01:04:57,439 --> 01:05:01,484
Extremely odd.

1186
01:05:04,112 --> 01:05:07,866
Kitty disappears for a second.
Cool as a cucumber.

1187
01:05:07,866 --> 01:05:11,828
When she returns,
she gently wakes up Harry.

1188
01:05:12,746 --> 01:05:15,874
Harry says, "What? I'm alone!"

1189
01:05:15,874 --> 01:05:19,836
She says, "Alone? You have
two other women in bed with you!"

1190
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:21,504
So, get this, Harry...

1191
01:05:21,504 --> 01:05:23,923
he says, "Come on, darling,"

1192
01:05:23,923 --> 01:05:27,886
"you gonna believe what you see
or what I tell you?"

1193
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:40,398
Good night, folks.

1194
01:05:44,235 --> 01:05:46,321
Miss Baxter, Miss Baxter!

1195
01:05:46,321 --> 01:05:48,823
Mary Sunshine from
The Evening Star.

1196
01:05:48,823 --> 01:05:51,326
I wonder if you would mind
saying a word or two?

1197
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:54,662
Sure I'll say three.
Go to hell!

1198
01:05:54,662 --> 01:05:56,956
Please direct your
questions to her counsel.

1199
01:05:56,956 --> 01:05:58,833
You're not my counsel.
I want my money back!

1200
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:01,044
It's not your money.
It's your mother's money.

1201
01:06:01,044 --> 01:06:02,295
Are you sorry, dear?

1202
01:06:02,295 --> 01:06:06,257
Sure I'm sorry.
Sorry I got caught.

1203
01:06:06,758 --> 01:06:08,551
- Okay, Miss Sunshine.
- Not now, Roxie.

1204
01:06:08,551 --> 01:06:10,428
I got a letter from a guy.

1205
01:06:10,428 --> 01:06:12,806
He says he's going on a
hunger strike until I'm free.

1206
01:06:12,806 --> 01:06:15,016
That's nice, kid.

1207
01:06:15,016 --> 01:06:18,561
Miss Baxter, did you know
these two ladies personally?

1208
01:06:18,561 --> 01:06:22,607
Did I know these two ladies
personally? Was that your question?

1209
01:06:22,607 --> 01:06:26,361
Yeah, that's my ques...

1210
01:06:26,361 --> 01:06:28,238
She's very high-spirited,
isn't she?

1211
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:29,906
Miss Baxter...

1212
01:06:29,906 --> 01:06:33,034
Hey, Mr. Flynn.

1213
01:06:33,034 --> 01:06:34,911
- Yeah, hi, Tracy.
- It's Roxie.

1214
01:06:34,911 --> 01:06:36,371
Yeah, sure, I was just kidding.

1215
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:38,998
Did you get my trial date yet?

1216
01:06:38,998 --> 01:06:42,002
- Listen, kid.
- I'm on top of your list, right?

1217
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:43,461
Go to hell!

1218
01:06:43,461 --> 01:06:47,340
What a helling, huh?
And socialite too.

1219
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,509
Her mother owns
all the pineapples in Hawaii.

1220
01:06:49,509 --> 01:06:51,302
What the hell do I care
about pineapples?

1221
01:06:51,302 --> 01:06:53,596
- All right, all right...
- Listen, hey. Hey!

1222
01:06:53,596 --> 01:06:56,808
That's all for the questions.

1223
01:06:56,808 --> 01:06:59,436
and afterwards I'll be happy
to give the interview myself.

1224
01:06:59,436 --> 01:07:03,481
Billy...

1225
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,403
How does it feel, kid?

1226
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:12,365
J. Edgar Hoover couldn't find
your name in the papers.

1227
01:07:18,288 --> 01:07:22,250
Mr. Flynn?

1228
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:24,127
Someone open this door
immediately.

1229
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:28,214
Oh, my god. Roxie!
What is it dear?

1230
01:07:29,257 --> 01:07:33,303
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't worry about me.

1231
01:07:33,845 --> 01:07:35,930
Oh, I only hope the fall
didn't...

1232
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:37,390
hurt the baby.

1233
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:38,725
Baby?

1234
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:40,810
Cheat!

1235
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:44,898
Roxie!

1236
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:50,111
Roxie, when did this happen,
darling?

1237
01:08:10,006 --> 01:08:12,717
Well, Doc?
Is she or isn't she?

1238
01:08:12,717 --> 01:08:16,805
She is.

1239
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:19,808
Would you swear
that statement in court?

1240
01:08:19,808 --> 01:08:22,519
- Yes.
- Good.

1241
01:08:22,519 --> 01:08:26,606
Button your fly.

1242
01:08:36,408 --> 01:08:40,245
I would just like to say that
my own life doesn't matter now,

1243
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:42,956
just that of my unborn child.

1244
01:08:42,956 --> 01:08:46,001
Poor dear, to have your baby
born in jail...

1245
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:47,752
My readers won't stand for this.

1246
01:08:47,752 --> 01:08:49,212
I can assure you
that won't happen.

1247
01:08:49,212 --> 01:08:51,423
She'll come to trial
at the earliest possible moment.

1248
01:08:51,423 --> 01:08:52,674
You can quote me on that.

1249
01:08:52,674 --> 01:08:53,591
I think it's sweet.

1250
01:08:53,591 --> 01:08:56,845
First time we ever have
one where a girl's knocked up.

1251
01:08:56,845 --> 01:08:59,014
When is the baby due, Roxie?

1252
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:01,641
Hey, Roxie...

1253
01:09:01,641 --> 01:09:03,810
Roxie! I just heard the good news!

1254
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:06,104
I'm the father.

1255
01:09:06,104 --> 01:09:07,772
Hey, Roxie, who's the father?

1256
01:09:07,772 --> 01:09:09,649
The question is completely
out of line.

1257
01:09:09,649 --> 01:09:11,735
How dare you insult
this...

1258
01:09:11,735 --> 01:09:15,822
this brave, young woman?
That's enough.

1259
01:09:16,531 --> 01:09:20,493
Roxie, honey!
It's me, daddy!

1260
01:09:20,493 --> 01:09:23,621
It's daddy!

1261
01:09:23,621 --> 01:09:27,584
Roxie, I came
as soon as I could.

1262
01:09:27,584 --> 01:09:31,546
Rox?

1263
01:09:38,636 --> 01:09:41,556
<i>* If someone stood up *
* in a crowd *</i>

1264
01:09:41,556 --> 01:09:44,267
<i>* And raised his voice up *
* way out loud *</i>

1265
01:09:44,267 --> 01:09:47,520
<i>* And waved his arm *
* and shook his leg *</i>

1266
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:51,066
<i>* You'd notice him *</i>

1267
01:09:51,066 --> 01:09:52,817
<i>* If someone *
* in the movie show *</i>

1268
01:09:52,817 --> 01:09:55,320
<i>* Yelled: "Fire *
* in the second row" *</i>

1269
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,990
<i>* "This whole place *
* is a powder keg!" *</i>

1270
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:02,410
<i>* You'd notice him *</i>

1271
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:06,498
<i>* And even without *
* clucking like a hen *</i>

1272
01:10:07,207 --> 01:10:11,086
<i>* Everyone gets noticed, *
* now and then, *</i>

1273
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:15,048
<i>* Unless, of course, *
* that personage should be *</i>

1274
01:10:15,965 --> 01:10:18,802
<i>* Invisible, *</i>

1275
01:10:18,802 --> 01:10:22,347

<i>* Cellophane *</i>

1278
01:10:30,772 --> 01:10:33,817
<i>* Mister Cellophane *</i>

1279
01:10:33,817 --> 01:10:36,528
<i>* Shoulda been my name *</i>

1280
01:10:36,528 --> 01:10:39,322
<i>* Mister Cellophane *</i>

1281
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:43,284
<i>* 'Cause you can look *
* right through me *</i>

1282
01:10:43,284 --> 01:10:46,329
<i>* Walk right by me *</i>

1283
01:10:46,329 --> 01:10:49,666
<i>* And never know I'm there... *</i>

1284
01:10:49,666 --> 01:10:52,377
<i>* I tell ya *</i>

1285
01:10:52,377 --> 01:10:54,129
<i>* Cellophane *</i>

1286
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:56,756
<i>* Mister Cellophane *</i>

1287
01:10:56,756 --> 01:10:59,759
<i>* Shoulda been my name *</i>

1288
01:10:59,759 --> 01:11:02,470
<i>* Mister Cellophane *</i>

1289
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:06,224
<i>* 'Cause you can look *
* right through me *</i>

1290
01:11:06,224 --> 01:11:09,060
<i>* Walk right by me *</i>

1291
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:13,106
<i>* And never know *
* I'm there. *</i>

1292
01:11:14,774 --> 01:11:18,737
Oh, I didn't see you.
Sit down.

1293
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:24,159
Look, Andy, I'm afraid
I gotta hit you hard.

1294
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,453
And I can only hope that
you'll be big about it.

1295
01:11:26,453 --> 01:11:29,164
- Amos, my name is Amos.
- Who said it wasn't?

1296
01:11:29,164 --> 01:11:32,917
Oh, it was the kid...
kid's name I was thinking about.

1297
01:11:32,917 --> 01:11:35,837
You know when she's due?
September.

1298
01:11:35,837 --> 01:11:39,174
Oh, but... You'll pass out
those cigars anyway.

1299
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:43,136
- I don't want you to give a damn when people...
- People what?

1300
01:11:43,678 --> 01:11:45,972
- Laugh.
- Laugh? Why would they laugh?

1301
01:11:45,972 --> 01:11:49,309
'Cause they can count.
Can you count?

1302
01:11:49,309 --> 01:11:53,271
September.

1303
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:57,859
Here's a copy of Roxie's
first statement from the D. A.'s office.

1304
01:11:58,276 --> 01:12:01,696
Says she hadn't copulated with you
for four months prior to the incident.

1305
01:12:01,696 --> 01:12:04,407
Well, she would know.

1306
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:08,370
Yeah, I guess we hadn't done
no copulatin' since...

1307
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:10,663
Wait a minute.

1308
01:12:10,663 --> 01:12:14,334
That don't figure out right.
I couldn't be the father.

1309
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:17,253
Well, forget about that now.
My client needs your support.

1310
01:12:17,253 --> 01:12:19,130
You mean she needs a meal ticket?

1311
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:22,759
That's all I've ever been.
But this time she's gone too far.

1312
01:12:22,759 --> 01:12:25,053
What are you gonna do?

1313
01:12:25,053 --> 01:12:27,472
- Divorce her?
- You're damn right!

1314
01:12:27,472 --> 01:12:30,600
I'll divorce her!

1315
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,562
She probably won't even notice.

1316
01:12:36,731 --> 01:12:40,819
Yeah. Yeah, put him through.

1317
01:12:40,902 --> 01:12:44,864
<i>* A human being's made of *
* more than air *</i>

1318
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:49,035
<i>* With all that bulk, you're bound *
* to see him there *</i>

1319
01:12:49,035 --> 01:12:53,123
<i>* Unless that human bein' *
* next to you *</i>

1320
01:12:53,957 --> 01:12:56,459
<i>* Is unimpressive, *</i>

1321
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:58,628
<i>* undistinguished *</i>

1322
01:12:58,628 --> 01:13:00,296
<i>* You *</i>

1323
01:13:00,296 --> 01:13:02,507
<i>* know *</i>

1324
01:13:02,507 --> 01:13:05,301
<i>* who... *</i>

1325
01:13:05,301 --> 01:13:09,264
- You're still here Ed?
- Yeah, I'm still here.

1326
01:13:10,223 --> 01:13:12,809
I think...

1327
01:13:12,809 --> 01:13:15,854
<i>* Shoulda been my name *</i>

1328
01:13:15,854 --> 01:13:18,440
<i>* Mister Cellophane *</i>

1329
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:22,402
<i>* 'Cause you can look *
* right through me *</i>

1330
01:13:22,402 --> 01:13:25,530
<i>* Walk right by me *</i>

1331
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:28,992
<i>* And never know I'm there... *</i>

1332
01:13:28,992 --> 01:13:31,369
<i>* I tell ya *</i>

1333
01:13:31,369 --> 01:13:33,163
<i>* Cellophane *</i>

1334
01:13:33,163 --> 01:13:35,957
<i>* Mister Cellophane *</i>

1335
01:13:35,957 --> 01:13:38,793
<i>* Shoulda been my name *</i>

1336
01:13:38,793 --> 01:13:41,296
<i>* Mister Cellophane *</i>

1337
01:13:41,296 --> 01:13:44,841
<i>* 'Cause you can look *

1338
01:13:44,841 --> 01:13:48,261
<i>* Walk right by me *</i>

1339
01:13:48,261 --> 01:13:53,266
<i>* And never know I'm there *</i>

1340
01:13:53,683 --> 01:13:59,647
<i>* Never even know *</i>

1341
01:14:03,693 --> 01:14:07,655
<i>* I'm there. *</i>

1342
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:16,623
I hope I didn't take up
too much of your time.

1343
01:14:20,377 --> 01:14:23,004
I've been waiting here for 10 minutes.
Don't do that again.

1344
01:14:23,004 --> 01:14:26,966
This dress makes me look like a Woolworth
lamp shade. I'm not wearing this.

1345
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:29,260
- You're wearing it because I tell you to wear it.
- I'm not wearing this dress.

1346
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:31,429
And when Andy's on the stand,
I want you to do knitting.

1347
01:14:31,429 --> 01:14:33,431
Knitting? Oh, for Christ's sake.

1348
01:14:33,431 --> 01:14:35,308
- A baby garment.
- I don't know how to knit!

1349
01:14:35,308 --> 01:14:38,520
- Then learn.
-That's no way to win a jury's sympathy.

1350
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:42,607
- Oh, you don't need advice anymore?
- Lookit here, Mr. Mouthpiece.

1351
01:14:42,607 --> 01:14:47,404
It seems to me that I'm the one
who's coming up with the good ideas.

1352
01:14:47,404 --> 01:14:51,241
I'm sick of everybody telling me what to do.
And you treat me like dirt.

1353
01:14:51,241 --> 01:14:54,577
You treat me like I'm some dumb,
common criminal.

1354
01:14:54,577 --> 01:14:56,454
But you are some dumb,
common criminal.

1355
01:14:56,454 --> 01:15:00,000
Well, it's better than being
a greasy, mick lawyer.

1356
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,878
- Who happens to be saving your ass.
- Who's out for all he can steal!

1357
01:15:03,878 --> 01:15:05,839
Maybe you'd like
to appeal in court without me.

1358
01:15:05,839 --> 01:15:08,675
Maybe I could. Have you read
the morning papers?

1359
01:15:08,675 --> 01:15:10,844
- They love me!
- My zop!

1360
01:15:10,844 --> 01:15:14,514
They'd love you a lot more if you were hanged.
You know why? 'Cause they'd sell more papers.

1361
01:15:14,514 --> 01:15:17,517
- You're fired.
- I quit.

1362
01:15:17,517 --> 01:15:21,604
Any lawyer in this town
would die to have my case.

1363
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:24,733
You're a phony celebrity.
You're flash in the pan

1364
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:28,069
and in a couple of weeks,
no one's gonna give a shit about you.

1365
01:15:28,069 --> 01:15:32,032
That's Chicago.

1366
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:34,325
No! No!

1367
01:15:34,325 --> 01:15:38,288
No! Not guilty!

1368
01:15:39,205 --> 01:15:40,874
What happened?

1369
01:15:40,874 --> 01:15:44,419
It's the Hunyak.
She lost her last appeal.

1370
01:15:44,419 --> 01:15:46,921
So what does that mean?

1371
01:15:46,921 --> 01:15:49,007
What that means, is that...

1372
01:15:49,007 --> 01:15:53,094
Next week, she's gonna...

1373
01:16:03,813 --> 01:16:07,901
This is Mary Sunshine,
coming to you from the Cook County Jail,

1374
01:16:08,109 --> 01:16:10,820
where history will be made today.

1375
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:13,740
Katelin Helinsky will become
the first woman

1376
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:17,160
in the state of Illinois
to be executed.

1377
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,536
And so ladies and gentlemen...

1378
01:16:18,536 --> 01:16:22,290
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for your pleasure and your entertainment,

1379
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:25,919
we proudly present
Katelin Helinsky

1380
01:16:25,919 --> 01:16:30,006
and her famous
Hungarian Disappearing Act.

1381
01:17:52,589 --> 01:17:56,551
Bravo!

1382
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:10,315
You know,
it's really not that bad.

1383
01:18:10,315 --> 01:18:11,983
You're clear about
everything we agreed on?

1384
01:18:11,983 --> 01:18:14,694
Yep. I've been up all night
rehearsing.

1385
01:18:14,694 --> 01:18:16,571
What do you do when Harrison
starts coming after you?

1386
01:18:16,571 --> 01:18:19,783
I sit still and look straight ahead.
Never at the jury.

1387
01:18:19,783 --> 01:18:22,077
- And?
- And I look modest.

1388
01:18:22,077 --> 01:18:24,496
- And?
- And...

1389
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:27,207
- And say nothing.
- That's right!

1390
01:18:27,207 --> 01:18:28,458
- That was the deal, right?
- Right.

1391
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:31,044
You ask me back,
I do all the talking this time.

1392
01:18:31,044 --> 01:18:33,338
Absolutely, Billy.
Whatever you say.

1393
01:18:33,338 --> 01:18:37,425
- Mr. Flynn, his honor is here.
- Thank you.

1394
01:18:38,343 --> 01:18:40,136
You ready?

1395
01:18:40,136 --> 01:18:44,182
Yeah.

1396
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:48,269
Billy...

1397
01:18:48,269 --> 01:18:52,232
I'm scared.

1398
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,026
Don't be.

1399
01:18:55,026 --> 01:18:59,114
I've been around a long time.
Believe me, you've got nothing to worry about.

1400
01:19:01,408 --> 01:19:05,370
It's all a circus.
A three-ring circus.

1401
01:19:05,662 --> 01:19:09,541
These trials, the whole world...

1402
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:12,877
It's all a show business.

1403
01:19:12,877 --> 01:19:16,423
But Kid,...

1404
01:19:16,423 --> 01:19:20,385
You're working with a star.

1405
01:19:24,139 --> 01:19:28,184
<i>* Give 'em the old razzle-dazzle *</i>

1406
01:19:28,518 --> 01:19:32,063
<i>* Razzle-dazzle 'em *</i>

1407
01:19:32,063 --> 01:19:36,026
<i>* Give 'em an act with *

1408
01:19:36,026 --> 01:19:39,863
<i>* And the reaction *

1409
01:19:39,863 --> 01:19:43,825
<i>* Give 'em the old hocus pocus *</i>

1410
01:19:44,242 --> 01:19:47,787
<i>* Bead and feather 'em *</i>

1411
01:19:47,787 --> 01:19:54,461
<i>* How can they see with sequins *
* in their eyes? *</i>

1412
01:19:55,628 --> 01:19:59,466
<i>* What if your hinges
all are rusting? *</i>

1413
01:19:59,466 --> 01:20:03,428
<i>* What if, in fact, *
* you're just disgusting ? *</i>

1414
01:20:03,845 --> 01:20:05,930
<i>* Razzle-dazzle them *</i>

1415
01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:10,018
<i>* And they'll never catch wise! *</i>

1416
01:20:23,239 --> 01:20:27,327
<i>* Give 'em the old razzle-dazzle *</i>

1417
01:20:27,619 --> 01:20:31,289
<i>* Razzle-dazzle them *</i>

01:20:31,289 --> 01:20:35,126

1419
01:20:35,126 --> 01:20:39,214
<i>* Row after row *

1420
01:20:39,214 --> 01:20:43,176
<i>* Give 'em the old *

1421
01:20:43,468 --> 01:20:46,930
<i>* Fool and fracture 'em *</i>

1422
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:51,810
<i>* How can they hear the truth *
* above the roar? *</i>

1423
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:54,854
<i>* Roar, roar, roar. *</i>

1424
01:20:54,854 --> 01:20:58,692
<i>* Throw 'em a fake and a finagle *</i>

1425
01:20:58,692 --> 01:21:02,654
<i>* They'll never know *

1426
01:21:03,196 --> 01:21:05,073
<i>* Razzle-dazzle them *</i>

1427
01:21:05,073 --> 01:21:09,869
<i>* And they'll beg you for more! *</i>

1428
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,580
- I Object!
- Sustained.

1429
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:16,543
Your honor, I haven't even
asked the question yet.

1430
01:21:25,927 --> 01:21:29,889
<i>* Give 'em the old dough br-ownie *</i>

1431
01:21:29,889 --> 01:21:33,309
<i>* Daze and dizzy 'em *</i>

1432
01:21:33,309 --> 01:21:37,272

1433
01:21:37,272 --> 01:21:41,234

1434
01:21:43,028 --> 01:21:46,990

01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:56,583

1437
01:21:58,126 --> 01:22:02,005

1438
01:22:02,005 --> 01:22:04,924

01:22:04,924 --> 01:22:06,259

1440
01:22:06,259 --> 01:22:08,136
<i>* Razzle-dazzle them *</i>

1441
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:12,223
<i>* And you're god of romance *</i>

1442
01:22:12,724 --> 01:22:15,435
- Hello, Amos.
- Amos?

1443
01:22:15,435 --> 01:22:17,937
That's right, Mr. Flynn. Amos.

1444
01:22:17,937 --> 01:22:20,982
Amos, when did you
file suit for divorce?

1445
01:22:20,982 --> 01:22:22,025
A month ago.

1446
01:22:22,025 --> 01:22:24,319
Was there any reason for
filing at this particular time?

1447
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:25,653
Well I'll say...

1448
01:22:25,653 --> 01:22:29,115
The newspapers said
Roxie was expecting a little stranger.

1449
01:22:29,115 --> 01:22:31,409
That's hardly ground for divorce,
is it?

1450
01:22:31,409 --> 01:22:34,120
A little too much of a stranger.

1451
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:37,665
By that you mean you doubted
the paternity of the child.

1452
01:22:37,665 --> 01:22:38,583
Well, sure.

1453
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:41,002
Tell me something, Amos.
Do you share a bed with your wife?

1454
01:22:41,002 --> 01:22:42,128
Yes, sir, every night.

1455
01:22:42,128 --> 01:22:46,216
You expect this jury to believe that
you slept next to this woman

1456
01:22:46,508 --> 01:22:49,135
every night without exercising
your rights as a husband?

1457
01:22:49,135 --> 01:22:51,721
- I could have if I wanted to.
- Oh, but you didn't.

1458
01:22:51,721 --> 01:22:53,098
- No, I did.
- Did what?

1459
01:22:53,098 --> 01:22:54,641
- Want to.
- But you didn't.

1460
01:22:54,641 --> 01:22:56,309
- Didn't what?
- What you wanted.

1461
01:22:56,309 --> 01:22:58,311
Wait a minute,
I'm getting confused here.

1462
01:22:58,311 --> 01:23:00,063
Hey, tell me Hart.
You tell me.

1463
01:23:00,063 --> 01:23:02,357
Did you ever question Roxie herself?

1464
01:23:02,357 --> 01:23:05,485
Did you even bother to ask her
if you were the father of her child?

1465
01:23:05,485 --> 01:23:07,278
- No, sir.
- No. What?

1466
01:23:07,278 --> 01:23:11,658
If you became convinced that you were wrong,
you'd be man enough to admit it. Wouldn't you?

1467
01:23:11,658 --> 01:23:13,326
You'd even be willing to take her back

1468
01:23:13,326 --> 01:23:16,037
if Roxie swore that you are
the father of her child,

1469
01:23:16,037 --> 01:23:20,083
- which she does.
- She does?

1470
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:23,420
She does!

1471
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:27,090
No more questions!
You can step down now.

1472
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:30,218
Well done, Andy.

1473
01:23:30,218 --> 01:23:34,180
Roxie, I'm so sorry.

1474
01:23:44,899 --> 01:23:46,568
<i>* Give 'em the old *</i>

1475
01:23:46,568 --> 01:23:49,070
<i>* Razzle-dazzle *</i>

1476
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:52,407
<i>* Razzle-dazzle them *</i>

1477
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:58,663
<i>* Show 'em the first rate *
* sorcerer you are *</i>

1478
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:03,793
<i>* Long as ya keep 'em *
* way off balance *</i>

1479
01:24:03,793 --> 01:24:07,756
<i>* How can they spot *
* ya got no talents? *</i>

1480
01:24:08,173 --> 01:24:14,929
<i>* Razzle-dazzle 'em *</i>

1481
01:24:14,929 --> 01:24:17,432
This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

1482
01:24:17,432 --> 01:24:21,519
Roxie Hart finally takes the stand
in her own defense.

1483
01:24:22,562 --> 01:24:31,613
<i>* And they'll make you a star! *</i>

1484
01:24:35,492 --> 01:24:38,495
Order! Order!

1485
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,997
Proceed, Mr. Flynn.

1486
01:24:40,997 --> 01:24:44,334
Roxie, I have here a statement
in which you admit to having...

1487
01:24:44,334 --> 01:24:47,045
illicit relations with the deceased,
Fred Casely.

1488
01:24:47,045 --> 01:24:49,964
- Is this statement true or false?
- I'm afraid that's true.

1489
01:24:49,964 --> 01:24:52,676
You're an honest girl, Roxie.

1490
01:24:52,676 --> 01:24:55,095
When did you first meet
Fred Casely?

1491
01:24:55,095 --> 01:24:57,597
When he sold Amos and me
our furniture.

1492
01:24:57,597 --> 01:25:01,351
And your personal relationship with him?
Can you tell the jury when that began?

1493
01:25:01,351 --> 01:25:04,562
When I permitted him
to escort me home one night,

1494
01:25:04,562 --> 01:25:06,564
I don't think I would've gone with him

1495
01:25:06,564 --> 01:25:09,484
if Mr. Hart and me hadn't
quarreled that very morning.

1496
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:11,444
- Quarreled?
- Yes, sir.

1497
01:25:11,444 --> 01:25:13,321
Well, I suppose it was his fault.

1498
01:25:13,321 --> 01:25:16,032
Oh, no, sir. It was my fault.

1499
01:25:16,032 --> 01:25:19,160
I suppose I just couldn't stop
pestering him.

1500
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:20,745
Pestering him? About what?

1501
01:25:20,745 --> 01:25:23,665
I didn't like him working
those long hours at the garage.

1502
01:25:23,665 --> 01:25:26,042
I wanted him home with me...

1503
01:25:26,042 --> 01:25:28,962
to darn his socks and
iron his shirts.

1504
01:25:28,962 --> 01:25:31,673
I wanted a real home,
and a child.

1505
01:25:31,673 --> 01:25:34,384
So you drifted into this
illicit relationship

1506
01:25:34,384 --> 01:25:36,469
because you were unhappy at home.

1507
01:25:36,469 --> 01:25:40,223
Yes, I was most unhappy.

1508
01:25:40,223 --> 01:25:42,017
Roxie Hart!

1509
01:25:42,017 --> 01:25:44,936
The state has accused you
of the murder of Fred Casely.

1510
01:25:44,936 --> 01:25:47,230
Are you guilty or not guilty?

1511
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:48,356
I'm not guilty...

1512
01:25:48,356 --> 01:25:50,775
I'm not guilty!
I killed him...

1513
01:25:50,775 --> 01:25:54,738
I did. But I'm not a
criminal. I'm not a criminal...

1514
01:25:57,532 --> 01:26:01,286
Roxie...

1515
01:26:01,286 --> 01:26:05,040
Do you recall
the night of January 14th?

1516
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:09,127
Could you tell the jury, in your own
words, the happenings of that night.

1517
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:14,007
When Fred came over,
I told him the good news.

1518
01:26:14,007 --> 01:26:15,675
And what was that?

1519
01:26:15,675 --> 01:26:19,012
That me and Amos were gonna
have a baby.

1520
01:26:19,012 --> 01:26:21,431
And that it was all over
between us.

1521
01:26:21,431 --> 01:26:23,391
What happened then?

1522
01:26:23,391 --> 01:26:27,354
Then...

1523
01:26:30,065 --> 01:26:31,524
Did he threaten you, Roxie?

1524
01:26:31,524 --> 01:26:33,818
Objection, your honor.
Counsel is leading the witness.

1525
01:26:33,818 --> 01:26:37,906
Sustained.

1526
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:42,160
What does Casely say
when you told him the news?

1527
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:46,122
I'll kill you before I see you
have another man's child!

1528
01:26:46,247 --> 01:26:49,167
Could you tell the audience...
the jury, what happened next?

1529
01:26:49,167 --> 01:26:50,919
In his passion, he...

1530
01:26:50,919 --> 01:26:53,755
tore off my robe
and he threw me on the bed.

1531
01:26:53,755 --> 01:26:57,300
And Mr. Hart's pistol
was lying there between us.

1532
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,009
And then!

1533
01:26:58,009 --> 01:27:00,428
And then we both reached for the gun
but I got it first.

1534
01:27:00,428 --> 01:27:03,973
And then he came towards me
with this funny look in his eyes.

1535
01:27:03,973 --> 01:27:05,725
He was angry and wild!

1536
01:27:05,725 --> 01:27:07,310
- Wild!
- Wild!

1537
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:08,978
And did you think
he meant to kill ya?

1538
01:27:08,978 --> 01:27:10,438
Oh, yes, sir!
Yes sir!

1539
01:27:10,438 --> 01:27:12,190
So it was his life or yours!

1540
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:16,152
Not just mine.
I closed my eyes and I shot!

1541
01:27:16,361 --> 01:27:17,946
In defense of your life!

1542
01:27:17,946 --> 01:27:21,991
To save my husband's
innocent unborn child.

1543
01:27:26,788 --> 01:27:29,416
Order!

1544
01:27:29,416 --> 01:27:32,544
What a bull's eye, huh?

1545
01:27:32,544 --> 01:27:36,589
- Order in this court!
- Roxie!

1546
01:27:36,715 --> 01:27:40,677
It's pandemonium here
in the courtroom...

1547
01:27:40,885 --> 01:27:44,305
Mrs. Hart's behavior throughout this ordeal
has been truly extraordinary.

1548
01:27:44,305 --> 01:27:45,348
Yeah, I bet it has...

1549
01:27:45,348 --> 01:27:48,810
Opening her eyes, she fans herself
with her attorney's handkerchief.

1550
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:51,187
- Handkerchief?
- Poor child has had no relief.

1551
01:27:51,187 --> 01:27:54,858
She looks around now,
bewildered, seeming to want something.

1552
01:27:54,858 --> 01:27:56,192
Oh, it's a glass of water.

1553
01:27:56,192 --> 01:27:58,486
Oh, Mama, that was my bid!
I told Billy,

1554
01:27:58,486 --> 01:27:59,654
I was gonna do that on my trial!

1555
01:27:59,654 --> 01:28:02,991
But now her eyes
flutter wildly and she...

1556
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:05,910
Mrs. Hart has fainted again.

1557
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:09,122
She flumps over, her chiffon dress
up around her knees,

1558
01:28:09,122 --> 01:28:12,584
revealing a glimpse of a blue garter
with rhinestone buckle.

1559
01:28:12,584 --> 01:28:16,212
Oh, Mama, she stole my garter.
She stole my garter!

1560
01:28:16,212 --> 01:28:18,506
Don't break my radio!

1561
01:28:18,506 --> 01:28:21,843
First the slob steals my publicity,
then she steals my lawyer, my trial date,

1562
01:28:21,843 --> 01:28:25,096
- now she stole my goddamn garter.
- What do you expect?

1563
01:28:25,096 --> 01:28:26,973
I mean these days
you get a little success

1564
01:28:26,973 --> 01:28:30,393
and it's good riddance
to the people who put you here.

1565
01:28:30,393 --> 01:28:32,687
There ain't no justice
in the world.

1566
01:28:32,687 --> 01:28:36,649
And there ain't nothing
you can do about it.

1567
01:28:37,067 --> 01:28:40,528
You think I got you up here
just so you can listen to my radio?

1568
01:28:40,528 --> 01:28:46,451
People write some pretty interesting things
when they think no one's looking.

1569
01:28:52,415 --> 01:28:55,835
Oh, Mama.

1570
01:28:55,835 --> 01:28:59,923
State calls a rebuttal witness.

1571
01:29:09,182 --> 01:29:10,850
Left hand on bible,
raise your right hand.

1572
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:13,478
You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing by the truth, so help you God?

1573
01:29:13,478 --> 01:29:17,107
- And then some.
- Have a seat.

1574
01:29:17,107 --> 01:29:18,692
Would you state your name
for the record please.

1575
01:29:18,692 --> 01:29:19,943
Velma Kelly.

1576
01:29:19,943 --> 01:29:23,363
Miss Kelly, will you please tell
the court if the object I'm holding

1577
01:29:23,363 --> 01:29:26,408
is the one you happened to came upon
in the defendant's jail cell?

1578
01:29:26,408 --> 01:29:27,325
Yes, it is.

1579
01:29:27,325 --> 01:29:29,953
I submit this as Exhibit X.

1580
01:29:29,953 --> 01:29:31,621
Roxie Hart's diary.

1581
01:29:31,621 --> 01:29:34,749
I object!
My client has never kept a diary.

1582
01:29:34,749 --> 01:29:36,501
And even if she did,
this would be

1583
01:29:36,501 --> 01:29:39,004
invasion of privacy and
violation of fourth amendment

1584
01:29:39,004 --> 01:29:40,672
and illegal search without a warrant.

1585
01:29:40,672 --> 01:29:44,426
Yeah, and she broke the lock!

1586
01:29:44,426 --> 01:29:46,928
Order!

1587
01:29:46,928 --> 01:29:49,639
Well, that settles that.
I'll allow it.

1588
01:29:49,639 --> 01:29:53,101
What's the big deal?
It's just a bunch of doodlings.

1589
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:56,229
If you would read for us,
please, Miss Kelly.

1590
01:29:56,229 --> 01:29:58,815
I haven't worked in a while.

1591
01:29:58,815 --> 01:30:03,111
- What a laugh, pluggin' Fred Casely.
- What?

1592
01:30:03,111 --> 01:30:04,863
The big baboon had it comin'.

1593
01:30:04,863 --> 01:30:08,408
I'm just sorry
I only got to kill him once.

1594
01:30:08,408 --> 01:30:10,410
I never wrote that.

1595
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:12,579
You... Hey, she made that up.

1596
01:30:12,579 --> 01:30:15,623
- She made that up.
- Order!

1597
01:30:16,124 --> 01:30:19,044
Please, Mr. Flynn,
get control of your client.

1598
01:30:19,044 --> 01:30:20,837
I'm sorry, you honor.
It won't happen again.

1599
01:30:20,837 --> 01:30:23,965
Sit down and shut up.
You're making it worse.

1600
01:30:23,965 --> 01:30:26,760
I have no more questions.

1601
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:30,305
Your witness, Mr. Flynn.

1602
01:30:30,305 --> 01:30:32,390
Ladies and gentlemen,

1603
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:36,353
a tap dance.

1604
01:30:39,814 --> 01:30:43,777
Tell me, Miss Kelly,
did you make a deal with Mr. Harrison?

1605
01:30:44,402 --> 01:30:47,739
Maybe to drop all charges against you
in exchange for testifying here today?

1606
01:30:47,739 --> 01:30:51,785
Oh, sure.
I'm not a complete idiot.

1607
01:30:52,118 --> 01:30:54,621
Good.

1608
01:30:54,621 --> 01:30:58,583
Since you gave such an impressive
performance for Mr. Harrison,

1609
01:30:58,667 --> 01:31:00,043
Maybe you'll do me
the same honor?

1610
01:31:00,043 --> 01:31:02,754
- I'd be delighted.
- Thank you.

1611
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:04,089
Here?

1612
01:31:04,089 --> 01:31:08,051
Fred Casely assured me he'd get me
an audition down at the Onyx.

1613
01:31:08,468 --> 01:31:11,179
And then he reneged on his pledge

1614
01:31:11,179 --> 01:31:13,598
and that was my motive
for attackin' him.

1615
01:31:13,598 --> 01:31:16,101
Pretty fancy way of saying:
The bit fat liar

1616
01:31:16,101 --> 01:31:20,063
who welshed on a deal,
so I shot him.

1617
01:31:21,314 --> 01:31:23,400
Amos accused me of
having an affair.

1618
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:27,362
So I told him
that the charge was...

1619
01:31:27,362 --> 01:31:29,531
- ...erroneous.
- Objection, your honor.

1620
01:31:29,531 --> 01:31:33,410
Mr. Flynn is twisting this evidence
to draw conclusions that are specious and...

1621
01:31:33,410 --> 01:31:36,329
- Erroneous?
- Exactly.

1622
01:31:36,329 --> 01:31:40,375
Order!

1623
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:43,211
Miss Kelly, do you know the
meaning of the word perjury?

1624
01:31:43,211 --> 01:31:44,337
Yes, I do.

1625
01:31:44,337 --> 01:31:46,214
- You also know that it's a crime?
- Yes.

1626
01:31:46,214 --> 01:31:50,301
For example if it turns out
that you knew that this diary was a fake,

1627
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:53,638
I'd hate to think of you rotting away
in prison for the next 10 years

1628
01:31:53,638 --> 01:31:56,016
especially since
you just won your freedom.

1629
01:31:56,016 --> 01:32:00,103
Look, all I know
is what I was told.

1630
01:32:01,563 --> 01:32:03,732
Oh, so...

1631
01:32:03,732 --> 01:32:07,819
So you didn't find
this diary in Roxie's cell?

1632
01:32:07,902 --> 01:32:11,031
No. Mama...

1633
01:32:11,031 --> 01:32:14,159
Miss Morton gave it to me.
She said someone had sent it to her.

1634
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:17,829
Someone? Any idea who
this mysterious benefactor might be?

1635
01:32:17,829 --> 01:32:19,789
No. She didn't know.

1636
01:32:19,789 --> 01:32:21,249
All right, let's see
if we can work this out.

1637
01:32:21,249 --> 01:32:25,211
Someone who writes about
"reneging on pledges"

1638
01:32:25,211 --> 01:32:29,299
And... "erroneous charges"...

1639
01:32:29,507 --> 01:32:32,010
Call me crazy, doesn't that
sound like a lawyer to you?

1640
01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:33,553
A lawyer!

1641
01:32:33,553 --> 01:32:37,307
A lawyer who honestly had
a sample of my client's handwriting.

1642
01:32:37,307 --> 01:32:41,186
Mr. Harrison, didn't you ask Roxie
to write out a confession for you?

1643
01:32:41,186 --> 01:32:43,980
Yes, but you're not suggesting that
I tamper with evidence, are you?

1644
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:46,483
No, let's not be ridiculous.

1645
01:32:46,483 --> 01:32:50,028
That's thoroughly and
utterly absurd.

1646
01:32:50,028 --> 01:32:51,488
But now that you mention it...

1647
01:32:51,488 --> 01:32:52,655
Your honor, this is outrageous.

1648
01:32:52,655 --> 01:32:55,241
It outrageous! I know, outrageous.
Even to suggest it.

1649
01:32:55,241 --> 01:32:59,329
The prosecutor would make
a thief's bargain with notorious Velma Kelly.

1650
01:32:59,329 --> 01:33:02,540
And then fabricate
the very evidence that set her free!

1651
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:04,209
Just so you can win another case

1652
01:33:04,209 --> 01:33:07,128
and move one step closer to
the governor's mansion

1653
01:33:07,128 --> 01:33:11,633
- Why it'd simply be an unimaginable...
- I'll hold you in contempt.

1654
01:33:11,633 --> 01:33:13,927
No, it's not even conceivable.

1655
01:33:13,927 --> 01:33:16,930
But... but if it were,
wouldn't it be time to say,

1656
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:19,432
Come clean, Mr. Harrison,
come clean...

1657
01:33:19,432 --> 01:33:23,812
Even in Chicago, this kind of corruption
cannot stand. Will not stand!

1658
01:33:23,812 --> 01:33:25,397
That's enough, Mr. Flynn!

1659
01:33:25,397 --> 01:33:29,359
I agree, your honor.
This is enough!

1660
01:33:30,193 --> 01:33:34,155
The defense rests.

1661
01:33:36,658 --> 01:33:38,118
Ladies and gentlemen,

1662
01:33:38,118 --> 01:33:42,080
this is Mary Sunshine reporting live
from the Cook County Courthouse.

1663
01:33:42,789 --> 01:33:46,543
The city of Chicago has come
to a complete standstill.

1664
01:33:46,543 --> 01:33:50,505
As the trial of the century
finally draws to a close.

1665
01:33:50,505 --> 01:33:54,467
Mrs. Hart sits quietly at the
defense table, hands folded,

1666
01:33:54,676 --> 01:33:58,221
wondering what fate has
in store for her?

1667
01:33:58,221 --> 01:34:00,306
And now a hush falls
over the courtroom

1668
01:34:00,306 --> 01:34:04,394
as the 12 men of the jury
file slowly back to their seats.

1669
01:34:06,146 --> 01:34:10,108
Gentlemen of jury,
have you reached a verdict?

1670
01:34:10,525 --> 01:34:12,944
We have, your honor.

1671
01:34:12,944 --> 01:34:15,864
The jury has reached a verdict.

1672
01:34:15,864 --> 01:34:19,909
Will the defendant please rise?

1673
01:34:21,161 --> 01:34:23,788
What is your verdict?

1674
01:34:23,788 --> 01:34:27,751
We, the jury, find the defendant...

1675
01:34:39,721 --> 01:34:43,808
Roxie Hart is innocent!
She's innocent! Get your paper!

1676
01:34:43,808 --> 01:34:47,771
Roxie Hart is free!
She's free! Roxie...

1677
01:35:03,912 --> 01:35:04,871
Come on! Move it!

1678
01:35:04,871 --> 01:35:08,833
First she shoots the husband
then she plugs the lawyer!

1679
01:35:11,419 --> 01:35:15,382
Hey, don't you wanna
take my picture?

1680
01:35:15,382 --> 01:35:19,344
Hey, I'm the famous Roxie Hart.

1681
01:35:19,886 --> 01:35:23,848
Hey, what happened?
What the hell happened?

1682
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:27,185
This is Chicago, kid.
You can't beat fresh blood on the walls.

1683
01:35:27,185 --> 01:35:29,979
But my publicity, Billy?
My name in the papers.

1684
01:35:29,979 --> 01:35:31,648
I was counting on that.

1685
01:35:31,648 --> 01:35:34,150
Your gratitude is overwhelming, kid.
I just saved your life.

1686
01:35:34,150 --> 01:35:37,696
Yeah, and you got $5,000.
And what do I get? I get nothing?

1687
01:35:37,696 --> 01:35:41,157
Five? Actually it's ten
once I collect from Velma.

1688
01:35:41,157 --> 01:35:42,617
I get nothing?

1689
01:35:42,617 --> 01:35:45,120
Don't forget your blessed diary.

1690
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:49,082
Hope you don't mind.
I added a few erroneous phrases in there.

1691
01:35:52,085 --> 01:35:53,962
Sorry, I couldn't tell you.

1692
01:35:53,962 --> 01:35:56,798
Couldn't take the chance.

1693
01:35:56,798 --> 01:36:00,760
Never lost a case.

1694
01:36:01,803 --> 01:36:05,765
You're a free woman,
Roxie Hart.

1695
01:36:06,057 --> 01:36:10,020
And God save Illinois.

1696
01:36:14,733 --> 01:36:18,778
Roxie.

1697
01:36:21,614 --> 01:36:24,409
What do you want?

1698
01:36:24,409 --> 01:36:27,328
I want you to come home.

1699
01:36:27,328 --> 01:36:31,082
You said you still wanted to...
and the baby...

1700
01:36:31,082 --> 01:36:35,045
Baby, what baby?

1701
01:36:36,004 --> 01:36:38,506
Oh, Jesus.

1702
01:36:38,506 --> 01:36:41,092
What do you take me for?

1703
01:36:41,092 --> 01:36:44,971
There ain't no baby.

1704
01:36:44,971 --> 01:36:48,933
There ain't no baby?

1705
01:36:51,311 --> 01:36:54,773
They didn't even
want my picture.

1706
01:36:54,773 --> 01:36:58,735
I just can't understand that.

1707
01:37:04,366 --> 01:37:08,328
What didn't they
even want my picture?

1708
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:18,630

Miss Roxie Hart says...

1717
01:37:39,484 --> 01:37:43,446

1740
01:39:00,315 --> 01:39:03,318
Yeah, who can keep
them straight anymore?

1747
01:39:13,953 --> 01:39:16,247
That's great.
We'll be in touch.

1748
01:39:16,247 --> 01:39:18,958
You know I'm not quite finished yet.
I have a...

1749
01:39:18,958 --> 01:39:20,335
Wait... one more.

1750
01:39:20,335 --> 01:39:23,880
I could... just a second I'm not...

1751
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:27,717
Goddamn it!

1752
01:39:27,717 --> 01:39:30,011
Thank you!

1753
01:39:30,011 --> 01:39:33,973
Here's your music, honey.

1754
01:39:38,561 --> 01:39:42,524
Thanks.

1755
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:54,327
You know you're really
pretty good.

1756
01:39:54,744 --> 01:39:58,164
Yeah. That and a dime.

1757
01:39:58,164 --> 01:40:00,375
What are you doing here?

1758
01:40:00,375 --> 01:40:03,503
I heard you've been...
making the rounds.

1759
01:40:03,503 --> 01:40:06,006
Yeah, well, if it was up to you,
I'd be swingin' by now.

1760
01:40:06,006 --> 01:40:08,174
Come on, I always knew
Billy'd get you off.

1761
01:40:08,174 --> 01:40:09,968
You should learn how
to put things behind you.

1762
01:40:09,968 --> 01:40:12,679
Oh, thank you.
I'll put that at the top of my list

1763
01:40:12,679 --> 01:40:15,598
right after finding a job
and an apartment with a john.

1764
01:40:15,682 --> 01:40:18,810
- Just shut up and listen to me?
- You really are something.

1765
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:22,480
Coming in here like...
some goddamn queen bee,

1766
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:25,608
All full of advice
for a poor slob like me.

1767
01:40:25,608 --> 01:40:28,528
Let me tell you something,
Miss Velma Kelly.

1768
01:40:28,528 --> 01:40:30,488
I got a new life now.

1769
01:40:30,488 --> 01:40:33,742
And one of the best things about it,
is it don't include you.

1770
01:40:33,742 --> 01:40:35,827
Fine. I just thought we could
help each other out.

1771
01:40:35,827 --> 01:40:36,953
Wait, you thought wrong,
didn't you?

1772
01:40:36,953 --> 01:40:39,789
Look... Listen to me.

1773
01:40:39,789 --> 01:40:41,666
I talked to this guy downtown.

1774
01:40:41,666 --> 01:40:45,628
He said one jazz girl is nothing
these days, but two...

1775
01:40:54,596 --> 01:40:57,307
We can make
a couple o' hundred a week.

1776
01:40:57,307 --> 01:40:58,850
Think about it, Roxie.

1777
01:40:58,850 --> 01:41:02,103
Our faces back in the papers
our names on the marquee.

1778
01:41:02,103 --> 01:41:05,106
"Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart"

1779
01:41:05,106 --> 01:41:07,525
Shouldn't it be alphabetical?

1780
01:41:07,525 --> 01:41:08,985
That could work.

1781
01:41:08,985 --> 01:41:10,945
A couple o' hundred?

1782
01:41:10,945 --> 01:41:16,076
- Maybe we could ask for a thou'.
- We're worth it.

1783
01:41:16,076 --> 01:41:20,038
Forget it, it'll never work.

1784
01:41:20,038 --> 01:41:22,832
- Why not?
- 'Cause I hate you.

1785
01:41:22,832 --> 01:41:31,174
There's only one business in the world
where that's no problem at all.

1786
01:41:36,513 --> 01:41:40,475
Ladies and gentlemen, the Chicago
theatre is proud to announce a first.

1787
01:41:40,975 --> 01:41:44,938
The first time anywhere
there's been an act of this nature.

1788
01:41:45,355 --> 01:41:48,400
Not only one little lady, but two.

1789
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,945
You read about them in the papers,
and now here they are.

1790
01:41:51,945 --> 01:41:54,447
Chicago's own killer dillers,

1791
01:41:54,447 --> 01:41:56,950
those scintillating sinners,

1792
01:41:56,950 --> 01:42:00,495
Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly!

1808
01:42:56,885 --> 01:42:59,929
Okay, you babes of Jazz,
let's pick up the pace.

1809
01:42:59,929 --> 01:43:02,640
Let's make the parties longer,
let's make the skirts shorter.

1810
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:05,226
Let's all go to hell in a fast car
and keep it hot!

1811
01:45:02,552 --> 01:45:06,598
Me and Roxie, we'd just
like to say thank you.

1812
01:45:06,806 --> 01:45:08,683
Thank you!

1813
01:45:08,683 --> 01:45:10,143
Believe us,

1814
01:45:10,143 --> 01:45:14,439
we could not
have done it without you!
