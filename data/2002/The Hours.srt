1
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,136
<i>Dearest,</i>

2
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,820
<i>I feel certain
that I am going mad again.</i>

3
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,049
<i>I feel we can't</i>

4
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,457
<i>go through another of these
terrible times,</i>

5
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,451
<i>and I shan't recover
this time.</i>

6
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,659
<i>I begin to hear voices
and can't concentrate.</i>

7
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,857
<i>so I am doing what seems
to be the best thing to do.</i>

8
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,610
<i>You have given me the greatest
possible happiness.</i>

9
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,090
<i>You have been, in every way.</i>

10
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,410
<i>All that anyone could be.</i>

11
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,568
<i>I know that I am spoiling
your life</i>

12
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,534
<i>and without me,
you could work.</i>

13
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,577
<i>And you will.</i>

14
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,014
I know.

15
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,698
<i>You see, I can't even
write this properly.</i>

16
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,132
<i>What I want to say</i>

17
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,690
<i>is that I owe all the happiness
of my life to you.</i>

18
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,090
<i>You have been entirely
patient with me.</i>

19
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,016
<i>And...</i>

20
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,378
<i>incredibly good.</i>

21
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,090
<i>Everything has gone from me,
but the certainty</i>

22
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,171
<i>of your goodness.</i>

23
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,420
<i>I can't go on spoiling
your life any longer.</i>

24
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,136
<i>I don't think two people
could have been happier</i>

25
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,618
<i>than we have been.</i>

26
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,136
<i>Virginia.</i>

27
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,530
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Mr. Woolf.

28
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,051
No worse, I think.

29
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,934
I see.

30
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,135
The main thing is to keep her
where she is. Keep her calm.

31
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,299
Friday, then.

32
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,535
- Good morning, Leonard.
- Good morning, Virginia.

33
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,890
How was your sleep?

34
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,496
Uneventful.

35
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,219
- The headaches?
- No.

36
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,179
No headaches.

37
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,335
Doctor seemed pleased.

38
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,973
- Tha's all from this morning?
- Yes.

39
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,370
This young man has submitted
his manuscript.

40
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,894
I've found three errors
of fact

41
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,812
And two spelling mistakes,

42
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,290
And I'm not yet
on page four.

43
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,132
Have you had breakfast?

44
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,417
Yes.

45
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,571
Liar.

46
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,890
Virginia,is not at my
insistence,is your own doctor's.

47
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,616
I'm going to send Nelly up

48
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,373
with some fruit and a bun.

49
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,539
Right, lunch, then.

50
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,414
Proper lunch, husband and wife
sitting down together,

51
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,490
soup

52
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,934
pudding and all.

53
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,211
By force, if necessary.

54
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,695
Leonard, I believe I may have
a first sentence.

55
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,291
Work, then.

56
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,139
Then you must eat.

57
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,688
Mrs Dalloway said

58
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,928
she would buy the flowers

59
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,178
herself.

60
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,810
Mrs Dalloway said she would buy
the flowers herself.

61
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,293
sally, I think I'll buy
the flowers myself.

62
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,616
What?

63
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,778
What flowers?

64
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,172
shit, I'd forgotten.

65
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,253
You're never gonna be a big boy
if you don't eat your breakfast.

66
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,455
You're gonna be the big brother,
i's a very important job.

67
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,655
Happy birthday.

68
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,333
- Morning, honey.
- Dan...

69
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,255
Roses, on your own birthday.
You're too much really.

70
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,777
Well, he'll eat it now
that you're here.

71
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,609
I's your birthday, you shouldn't
be out buying me flowers.

72
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,259
Well, you were still sleeping.

73
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,456
so?

74
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,812
Well, we decided it
would be bette

75
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,334
if we let you sleep
in a little. Didn't we?

76
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,138
Good morning, bug.

77
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,732
You know, you need to rest, Laura.

78
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,459
You're only four months away.

79
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,850
I'm fine.
I'm just tired.

80
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,090
I've been telling him
he's gotta eat his breakfast.

81
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,329
Tha's true.

82
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,059
so,is a beautiful day.

83
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,373
What are you two going
to be doing with it?

84
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,929
We've got our plans.
Don't we?

85
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,135
What plans?

86
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,050
Well, it wouldn't be much
Of a party

87
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,097
would it, if I told you
every detail in advance?

88
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,934
Well, I'd better just stop asking
questions, then, huh?

89
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,135
Is that the time?

90
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,449
I'd better get going.

91
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,214
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

92
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,694
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

93
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,053
You need to finish your breakfast.

94
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,739
You know, I'm gonna make a cake.

95
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,538
Tha's what I'm gonna do.

96
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,851
I'm gonna make the cake for daddy's
birthday.

97
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,419
Mommy, can I help?

98
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,774
Can I help make the cake?

99
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,854
Of course you can, sweet pea.

100
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,288
I'm not gonna do anything
without you.

101
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,496
No, of course,
you have to come.

102
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,934
Of course.

103
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,335
Well, I always wanted you,

104
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,178
and everybody involved
in the actual ceremony.

105
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,289
I don't know.
Around sixty.

106
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,818
Well, it will. I'll mean so much...
The whole occasion.

107
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,811
I's the least I can do to
have a nice dinner

108
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,573
and say thank you to everybody.

109
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,013
Oh, I take that as a yes.

110
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,939
- Oh my God.
- Oh, tha's great. I'm thrilled.

111
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,013
<i>- What if nobody comes?
- This is Clarissa Vaughan.</i>

112
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,579
Yes, I am just confirming that you're
sending the car to pick me up first.

113
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,213
- Hi, Clarissa.
- Hi. Can't talk.

114
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,928
And then we're going
over to 679, Hudson...

115
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,535
which is at 9th
and 14th.

116
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,818
Then you will take me uptown
and you will wait for us.

117
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,129
And I'll be over at seven.

118
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,934
Flowers.

119
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,779
What a beautiful morning.

120
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,978
Hi, Clarissa.
How are you?

121
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,008
I'm having a party. My friend
Richarďs won the Carrouthers.

122
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,251
Well, tha's just terrific.

123
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,899
If I knew what it was.

124
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,494
I's a poetry prize.
For a life's work.

125
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,739
I's the most prestigious. For a
poet,is the best you can do.

126
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,539
Very good. so, what would you like?
The lilies are perfect.

127
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,691
No, too morbid...
Hydrangeas, I think.

128
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,136
And...

129
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,339
le's just have buckets
of roses. And...

130
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,297
I think I'm gonna take these
with me.

131
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,416
Okay.

132
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:28,777
Thank you.

133
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,257
I actually tried
to read Richarďs novel.

134
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,975
You did?

135
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,059
Oh, I know.
I's not easy.

136
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,295
It did take him ten years to write.

137
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,210
Maybe it just takes
another ten to read.

138
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,329
-is you, isn't it?
- What is?

139
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,808
In the novel?

140
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,891
Oh, I see.

141
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,536
Yeah.

142
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,409
sort of...

143
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,775
I mean, in a way.

144
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,933
Richarďs a writer.
He uses things which actually happen.

145
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,056
Yeah.

146
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,451
And, years ago, he and I were
students, tha's true,

147
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,258
but, then he changes things.

148
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,137
Oh, sure.

149
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,177
I don't mean in a bad way.

150
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,770
I's more like...
he makes them his own.

151
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,091
<i>A woman's whole life</i>

152
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,411
<i>in a single day.</i>

153
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,011
<i>Just one day.</i>

154
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,491
<i>And in that day</i>

155
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,376
<i>her whole life.</i>

156
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,376
This is what we need:
shortening...

157
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,734
Mrs Dalloway,is you.

158
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,379
Yes,is me!

159
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,175
- Oh,is me.
- Come in.

160
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,417
Richard,
i's a beautiful morning.

161
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,249
How about we let
in a little more light?

162
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,616
Is it still morning?

163
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,532
- Yes, it is.
- Have I died?

164
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,497
Good morning, my dear.

165
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,819
- Any visitors?
- Yes.

166
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,970
Are they still here?

167
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,448
No, they've gone.

168
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,371
- How did they look?
- Today?

169
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,338
sort of like black fire.

170
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,698
I mean, sort of light
and dark at the same time.

171
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,256
There was one a bit like an
electrified jellyfish.

172
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,097
They were singing...
It may have been Greek.

173
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,335
so the ceremony is at five...
Do you remember?

174
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,058
And then, the party
is right after.

175
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,014
They did bring you breakfast,
didn't they?

176
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,539
What a question.
Of course.

177
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,253
Richard, you did eat it?

178
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,575
Well, can you see it?

179
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,378
Is it here?

180
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,736
Is there any breakfast

181
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,016
- lying around?
- No, I don't see it.

182
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,773
Well then, I must have eaten it,
mustn't I?

183
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,257
- I suppose.
- Does it matter?

184
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,096
Of course it matters.

185
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,415
You know what the doctors say.

186
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,218
Have you been skipping pills?

187
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,610
- Clarissa, I can't take this.
- Take what?

188
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,169
Having to be proud and brave
in front of everybody.

189
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,775
Oh, honey,is not
a performance.

190
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,490
Of course it is. I got the prize
for my performance.

191
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,255
I got the prize for having AIDs and
going nuts and being brave about it.

192
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,218
I actually got the prize for
having come through.

193
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,018
I's not true.

194
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,579
- For surviving.
-is not true.

195
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,176
Oh, you think they would have
given it to me if I were healthy?

196
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,138
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

197
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,612
Is it here somewhere?

198
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,135
- What?
- The prize. I'd like to look at it.

199
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,415
No, you haven't gotten it yet.

200
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,617
-is tonight.
- Are you sure?

201
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,693
I remember the ceremony perfectly.

202
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,059
I seem to have fallen
out of time.

203
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:37,971
Richard...

204
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,016
Richard...

205
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,576
I's a party
I's only a party.

206
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,456
Populated entirely by people
who respect and admire you.

207
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,612
small party, is it?
select party, is it?

208
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,088
Your friends.

209
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,015
I thought I lost all my friends.
I thought I drove them crazy.

210
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,695
Jesus.

211
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,215
"Oh, Mrs Dalloway,

212
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,694
always giving parties
to cover the silence.

213
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,616
Richard...

214
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,979
You won't need to do anything.
All you have to do is appear.

215
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,929
sit on the sofa.

216
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,731
And I will be there.

217
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,455
This is a group of people

218
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,168
who want to tell you
your work is going to live.

219
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,696
Oh, is it? Is my work going
to live?

220
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,051
I can't go through
with it, Clarissa.

221
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,579
- Why do you say that?
- I can't.

222
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,530
Why?

223
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,253
8ecause I wanted
to be a writer, tha's all.

224
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,256
so?

225
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,776
I wanted to write about it all.

226
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,969
Everything that happens
in a moment.

227
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,289
The way the flowers looked when you
carried them in your arms,

228
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,294
this towel, how it smells,
how it feels, this thread.

229
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,858
All our feelings,

230
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,852
yours and mine.

231
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,249
The history of it...
Who we once were.

232
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,650
Everything in the world.

233
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,088
Everything all mixed up.

234
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,375
Likeis all mixed up now.

235
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,091
And I failed at it.

236
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,418
I failed.

237
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,414
No matter what you start with, it
ends up being so much less.

238
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,216
sheer fucking prid
and stupidity.

239
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,011
We want everything,

240
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,294
don't we?

241
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,410
I suppose we do.

242
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,412
You kissed me on a beach.

243
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,137
Yeah.

244
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,939
Do you remember...

245
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,412
how many years ago?

246
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,570
Of course I...

247
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,895
What did you want... then?

248
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,813
Come closer.

249
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,414
I'm right here.

250
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,891
Come closer would you, please?

251
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,293
Take my hand.

252
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,338
Would you be angry...

253
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,617
Would I be angry if you didn't show
up at the party?

254
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,058
Would you be angry if I died?

255
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,376
If you died?

256
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,657
Who is this party for?

257
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,654
What do you mean, who is it for?
What are you asking?

258
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,494
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm not trying to say anything.

259
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,139
I'm saying

260
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,294
I think I'm only staying alive
to satisfy you.

261
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,055
Well?

262
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,370
That is what we do.

263
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,133
That is what people do.

264
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,974
They stay alive
for each other.

265
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,220
And the doctors told you:
You don't need to die.

266
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,690
They told you that.
You can

267
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,455
- live like this for years.
- Well, exactly.

268
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,371
I don't accept this.

269
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,978
I don't accept what you're saying.

270
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,575
Andis for you to decide,
is it?

271
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,849
How long have you been doing that?

272
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,010
How many years...

273
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,329
coming to the apartment?

274
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,255
What about your own life?

275
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,051
What about sally?

276
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,497
Just wait till I die, then
you'll have to think of yourself.

277
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,693
How are you going to like that?

278
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,616
Richard.

279
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,296
It would be great if you did
come to the party.

280
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,533
If you felt well enough
to come.

281
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,337
Just to let you know, I am making
the crab thing.

282
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,014
Not that I imagine it makes any
difference to you.

283
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,899
Of course it makes a difference.
I love the crab thing.

284
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,176
Clarissa!

285
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,776
Yes?

286
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,417
I'll be back at three-thirty
and I'll help you get dressed.

287
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,536
Wonderful.

288
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,332
Three-thirty.

289
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,296
Wonderful.

290
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,732
<i>I's on this day,</i>

291
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,255
<i>this day of all days,</i>

292
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,895
<i>her fate becomes clear to her.</i>

293
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,409
Excuse me, Mrs Woolf,

294
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,776
Mr Woolf said I was to come
and speak with you.

295
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,417
I've nearly finished, Nelly.

296
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,572
Please attend me in the kitchen,
I'll be down very soon.

297
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,175
she says she wants something,
then it turns out she doesn't.

298
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,853
Well, she never does, does she?

299
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,499
she never wants anything.

300
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,289
Especially when she's particularly
asked for it. Tha's a sure sign.

301
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,610
- I wish I'd been there.
- I wish you had too.

302
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,771
Did you give her that look?

303
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,295
That sort of look you do?

304
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,094
I said, "Madam..."

305
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,251
Yes, Nelly, tell me,

306
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,890
- how can I help?
-is about lunch.

307
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,174
I just had to go ahead
on my own.

308
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,978
I understand.

309
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,575
You chose a pie?

310
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,299
I chose a lamb pie.

311
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,494
That seems suitable.

312
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,738
You being so busy
with your writing.

313
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,370
I had no instructions.

314
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,332
You do remember that my sister
is coming at four with the children?

315
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,455
Yes, ma'am, I hadn't forgotten.

316
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,454
China tea, I think.

317
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,579
And ginger.

318
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,770
Ginger, madam?

319
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,415
I'd like to give the children
a treat.

320
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,853
We'd have to go to London
for ginger, madam.

321
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,371
I haven't finished this, and there's
the rest of lunch to get ready.

322
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,617
The twelve-thirty train, Nelly, will
get you into London just after one.

323
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,816
If you return on the two-thirty,
you should be back

324
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,692
in Richmond soon after three.

325
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,529
Do I miscalculate?

326
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,375
No.

327
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,093
Well, then, is something
detaining you, Nelly?

328
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,657
I can't think of anything more
exhilarating than a trip to London.

329
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,659
- Good morning, Mrs Woolf.
- Good morning.

330
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,573
We shall publish no more
new authors.

331
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,696
I have to tell you

332
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,419
I have discovered ten errors
in the first proof.

333
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,015
Lucky to have found them.

334
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,820
Paschendale was a charnel-house

335
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,858
from which no min returned.

336
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,539
Do you thinkis possible that bad
writing actually attracts

337
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,008
a higher incidence
of error?

338
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,135
Ifis all right, I thought I
might take a short walk.

339
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:58,976
Not far?

340
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,448
No, just for air.

341
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,611
Go then.

342
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,734
If I could walk mid-morning
I'd be a happy man.

343
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,493
she'll die.

344
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,331
she's going to die.

345
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,291
Tha's wha's going to happen.

346
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,014
Tha's it.

347
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,253
she'll kill herself.

348
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,130
she'll kill herself over something
that doesn't seem to matter.

349
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,694
Le's think.

350
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,573
You grease the pan, mommy.

351
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,651
I know you grease the pan,
sweet one.

352
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,969
Even mommy knows that.

353
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,291
This is what we're gonna do.

354
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,814
Flour,

355
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,890
bowl,

356
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,250
sifter.

357
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,330
Can I do it, mommy?

358
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,895
Can you sift the flour?

359
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,698
Yes, you can sift the flour, baby,
if tha's what makes you happy.

360
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,176
There.

361
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,731
Isn't it beautiful?

362
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,698
Don't you think it looks like snow?

363
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,213
Okay. Now,

364
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,573
the next thing
I'm gonna show you...

365
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,811
is...
we measure out the cups.

366
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,210
Mommy, it isn't that difficult.

367
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,020
No, I know it isn't difficult.
I's just that I...

368
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,851
- just wanna do this for daddy.
- Becauseis his birthday?

369
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,215
Tha's right.

370
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,097
We're baking the cake to show
him that we love him.

371
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,171
Otherwise he won't know
we love him?

372
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,654
Tha's right.

373
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,898
I got all the stuff.

374
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,695
I'm going right out again.
My God, what a zoo.

375
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,899
Why do people have to talk about dry
cleaning? What is there to talk about?

376
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,690
I bought you some flowers.

377
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,489
Where are you?

378
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,175
In here.

379
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,729
I got someone at work
to cover me.

380
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,379
I'll be with you all night.

381
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,055
Are you all right?

382
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,416
sure.

383
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,411
I guess you saw Richard.

384
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,854
Tha's right.

385
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,418
Well, of course.

386
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,213
I bet he said,
"Oh by the way, honey,

387
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,734
do you mind,
can I skip the party?".

388
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,652
- Don't worry, he always shows up.
- Oh, sure.

389
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,219
In the end.

390
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,657
What, Richard miss an award? A
chance to talk about his work?

391
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,334
I don't think so.
He'll show up.

392
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,573
You did the seating.

393
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,134
I did.

394
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,778
I don't believe it,
Louis Waters?

395
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,692
Is Louis coming?
Richarďs Louis?

396
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,214
He is.

397
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,616
You put him next to me.

398
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,292
Why do I always have
to sit next to the exes?

399
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,892
And, anyway, shouldn't the exes
have a table of their own

400
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,608
where they can all 'ex'
together

401
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,135
in exquisite agony?

402
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,616
I'm off.

403
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,572
Try not to pass out from
excitement.

404
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,575
Clarissa...is going to be
beautiful.

405
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,299
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

406
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,851
Why is everything wrong?

407
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,452
It didn't work, dammit.

408
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,219
- Hey, scott.
- Hi, Mrs Dryer.

409
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,259
There's someone at the door!

410
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,459
Hello?

411
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,651
Hello?
Laura?

412
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,012
- Hi, Kitty.
- Hi. Am I interrupting?

413
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,569
- Of course not. Come in.
- Are you all right?

414
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,176
Why, sure.

415
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,933
Hi, Richie.

416
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,774
sit down, I've got coffee on.

417
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,128
- Would you like some?
- Please.

418
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,292
Look, you made a cake.

419
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,450
I know.

420
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,179
It didn't work.

421
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,172
I thought it was gonna work.

422
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,650
I thought it would work better
than that.

423
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,897
Oh, Laura, I don't understand
why you find it so difficult.

424
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,052
I mean, anyone can make a cake.
- I know.

425
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,733
I's ridiculously easy.

426
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,459
Like I bet you didn't
even grease the pan.

427
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,338
I greased the pan.

428
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,491
All right.
But,

429
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,332
you have other virtues.

430
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,140
And Dan loves you so much
he won't even notice.

431
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,972
Whatever you do, he's gonna say
i's wonderful.

432
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,653
Well,is true.

433
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,136
Does Ray have a birthday?

434
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,091
- sure he does.
- When is it?

435
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,216
september.

436
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,452
We always go
to the country club.

437
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,294
We drink Martinis and spend the day
with fifty people.

438
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,859
Ray's got a lot of friends.

439
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,213
He does.

440
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,770
You both have a lot of friends.
You're good at it.

441
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,896
How is Ray? I haven't seen him in
a while.

442
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,619
Ray's fine.

443
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,090
These guys are something,
aren't they?

444
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,494
You can say that again.

445
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,732
They came home from the war...
they deserved it, didn't they?

446
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,698
After what they'd been through.

447
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,658
What... did they deserve?

448
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,776
I don't know.
Us, I guess.

449
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,774
All this.

450
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,498
You're reading a book.

451
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,656
Yeah.

452
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,571
Wha's this one about?

453
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,296
I's about...
this woman who's incredibly...

454
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,768
...well, she's a hostess
and she's incredibly confident.

455
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,208
And she's going to give a party.
And maybe because she's confident,

456
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,530
everyone thinks she's fine.

457
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,694
8ut she isn't.

458
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,975
so...

459
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,576
Well...

460
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,499
Kitty, what is it?
Is something wrong?

461
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,098
I have to go into the hospital
for a couple of days.

462
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,459
Yeah, I have...

463
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:32,180
some kind of growth
in my uterus,

464
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,297
and they're gonna go in
and take a look.

465
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,097
When?

466
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,453
This afternoon.

467
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,773
I need you to feed the dog.

468
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,093
Of course.

469
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,012
Is that what you came here to ask?

470
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,778
What did the doctor say, exactly?

471
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,368
Well,is probably what the
trouble's been...

472
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,410
About getting pregnant.

473
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,492
The thing is

474
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:23,535
I mean, you know, I've been...
really happy with Ray.

475
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,695
And now it turns out
there was a reason

476
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,937
there was a reason
I couldn't conceive.

477
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,373
You're lucky, Laura.

478
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,259
I don't think you can call yourself
a woman until you're a mother.

479
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,091
I mean, the joke is

480
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,048
all my life I could do
everything.

481
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,691
I could do anything, really.

482
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,258
Except the one thing I wanted.

483
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,057
Yes.

484
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,494
Tha's all.

485
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,931
Well, at least now they'll be
able to deal with it.

486
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,010
Tha's what they're doing.

487
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,857
I'm not worried. What would be
the point of worrying?

488
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,772
No,is not in your hands.

489
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,851
Well, tha's it.

490
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:26,374
I's in the hands of some physician
I've never even met.

491
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,890
some surgeon who

492
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,217
probably drinks more Martinis
than Ray, and,

493
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,610
I mean, of course I'm worried
about Ray.

494
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,655
- Come here.
- I'm doing fine.

495
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,811
- Really.
- I know. I know you are.

496
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,735
No. I'm more worried about Ray,
he's not good with this stuff.

497
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,373
Forget about Ray.
Just forget about Ray.

498
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,298
You're sweet.

499
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,814
You know the routine, right?

500
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,173
Half a can in the evening, and
check the water now and then,

501
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,976
Ray will feed him in the
morning.

502
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,533
Kitty, you didn't mind?

503
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,176
What?

504
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,854
I didn't mind what?

505
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,812
Do you want me to drive you?

506
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,972
I think I'll feel better
if I drive myself.

507
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,299
Kitty,is gonna be all right.

508
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,615
Of course it is.

509
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:08,937
Bye.

510
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,413
What?
What do you want?

511
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,458
Mr Woolf, Mrs 8ell has arrived.

512
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,618
she's not due till four.

513
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,774
Well, I can't help that.
she's here.

514
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,450
You look a perfect angel.

515
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,011
Don't let the boys make fun
of you.

516
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,249
Fly away.

517
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,854
Virginia.

518
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,055
Leonard thinksis the end
of civilisation,

519
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,814
people who are invited at four
and arrive at two-thirty.

520
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,093
Oh God!

521
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,496
Barbarians.

522
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,410
We finished lunch sooner
than we imagined.

523
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,776
I've had to send Nelly off
to London for sugared ginger.

524
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,132
Oh, Virginia...

525
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,611
you're not still frightened
of the servants, are you?

526
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,734
Come on.

527
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,210
And how are you, sister?

528
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,020
Frantic.is been ridiculous
in London.

529
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,252
Ridiculous how?

530
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,016
Busy.

531
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,218
Why is busy ridiculous?

532
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,730
I would have invited you
to our party...

533
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,335
- but I knew you wouldn't come.
- Did you? How did you know that?

534
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,251
I thought you never came to town.

535
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,768
Tha's because
you no longer ask me.

536
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,251
Are you not forbidden to come?

537
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,896
Do the doctors not forbid it?

538
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,937
Oh, the doctors...

539
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,173
Do you not pay heed
to your doctors?

540
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,253
Not when they're a bunch
of contemptible Victorians.

541
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,377
What are you saying?

542
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,658
Are you feeling better?

543
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,370
Has this vastness made you
stronger?

544
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:44,533
I'm saying, Vanessa, that even
crazy people like to be asked.

545
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,019
Nessa, Nessa!

546
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,613
Hello, changelings.
What have you got?

547
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,250
- What have you found?
- We've found a bird.

548
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,699
- Did you?
- Yes.

549
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,578
Where did you find that?

550
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,458
I think it must have fallen
from a tree.

551
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,772
Oh my goodness,
just look at him.

552
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,011
We might be able to save him.

553
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,534
save him?

554
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,768
I think you have to be careful,
Quentin.

555
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,533
There's a time to die...

556
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,452
...and it may be the birďs time.

557
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,019
Come on, le's pick some grass
to make a grave.

558
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,932
- Oh, Julian.
- I'm just saying.

559
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,613
Then at least there'll be
a bed for him to die on.

560
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,568
Come on, Nessa,

561
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,730
le's make a grave.

562
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,048
- Nessa, come on.
- Nessa, hurry up.

563
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,610
Oh God. Oh, very well,
I'm coming. Wait for me then.

564
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:34,097
Angelica, will you be all right?
stay with your aunt.

565
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,376
You're going too fast.

566
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,895
Look, Julian, over here.

567
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,695
Do you think she'd like roses?

568
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,256
Is it a she?

569
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:09,335
Yes, the females are larger.

570
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,931
And less colourful.

571
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,136
What happens when we die?

572
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,059
What happens?

573
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,130
We return to the place
that we came from.

574
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,929
I don't remember
where I came from.

575
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,409
Nor do I.

576
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,978
she looks very small.

577
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,649
Yes, tha's one
of the things that happens.

578
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,213
We look smaller.

579
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,732
But very peaceful.

580
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,333
We found you.

581
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,413
Nessa, where were you?

582
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,571
Come on, Nessa, le's go.

583
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,931
Is it done?
Have you finished?

584
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,852
- Is the bird funeral complete?
- Yes.

585
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,208
Very well then.

586
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,974
Are we to be denied tea altogether
for coming so early?

587
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,372
No, of course not.

588
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,572
Come on, Angelica.

589
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,048
Come on, boys.
Le's have some tea.

590
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,370
Nessa, tell him to stop it.

591
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,372
Oh, stop it, Julian.

592
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:30,896
Virginia?

593
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,056
We're going in.

594
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,291
Virginia!

595
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,856
Hey, bug...
I've got this idea.

596
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,489
We're gonna make another cake.

597
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,932
We're gonna make a better one.

598
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,454
What happened to the first one?

599
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,051
And after that,

600
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,411
I think we should go out.

601
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:21,536
Yes?

602
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,693
Clarissa,is Louis.

603
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,614
<i>- Louis Waters.
- Louis?</i>

604
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,932
Oh my God. You're early.

605
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,533
Do you mind? Is it all right?

606
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:52,330
Why should I mind?
I'm delighted.

607
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,094
Well now.

608
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,494
- I feel like I'm interrupting.
- Oh, why? No.

609
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,013
Well, I know the ceremony isn't until
five, but I flew in this morning.

610
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,409
Richarďs going to be thrilled.

611
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,616
- He'll be thrilled to see you.
- You think so?

612
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,216
Of course.

613
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,089
What are we doing?
We should go in.

614
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:31,975
Are you all right?

615
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,413
Yes.is nothing.
I's just the party.

616
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,968
Oh, right.

617
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,495
Oh,is looking beautiful.

618
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,175
Thanks.

619
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:44,977
Are you still with?

620
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,853
Yes, I am still with her.
Ten years.

621
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:49,731
I's crazy.

622
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,774
Why is it crazy?

623
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,979
No reason. Would you like
something to drink?

624
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:56,616
some water.

625
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,778
And you're still an editor?

626
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,453
Oh, sure.

627
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,335
With the same publisher?

628
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,815
How's san Francisco?

629
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,212
I's one of those cities

630
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,734
people tell you to like.

631
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,734
Richard said he thought
you were happy out there.

632
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,653
Oh, great. so now the illness
makes him psychic.

633
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,939
You have to prepare yourself,
Louis.

634
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,213
He's very changed.

635
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,249
I read the book.

636
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,338
- Oh God.
- Exactly.

637
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:04,537
I thought you were meant to do more
than just change people's names.

638
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,613
Isn't it meant to be fiction?
He even had you living

639
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,215
- on 10th street.
- It isn't me.

640
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,290
Isn't it?

641
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:14,531
You know how Richard is.

642
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,974
I's a fantasy.

643
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,780
A whole chapter on 'should she
buy some nail polish'?

644
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,171
And then, guess what?
After fifty pages she doesn't.

645
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,213
The whole thing seems to go on
for eternity. Nothing happens.

646
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:30,457
And then wham - for no reason,
she kills herself.

647
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,817
His mother kills herself.

648
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:34,459
Yeah, sure, his mother,
but still for no reason.

649
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:37,816
Out of the blue.

650
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,298
I know the book is tough,

651
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,495
but I liked it.

652
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,456
I know.

653
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,818
Only one thing upset me.

654
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,010
Wha's that?

655
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,770
That there wasn't more
about you.

656
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,496
Tha's kind.

657
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,018
I went back to Wellfleet.

658
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,172
- You did?
- One day.

659
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,296
I didn't tell you?

660
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:18,016
No.
But then I never see you.

661
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,170
You remember the house?

662
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,734
-is still there.
- I think you're courageous.

663
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,573
Courageous? Why?

664
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,014
To dare

665
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,496
go visit.
What I mean

666
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,413
is to face the fact
that we have lost

667
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,293
those feelings for ever.

668
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,769
I don't know wha's happening.
I'm sorry.

669
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,898
I seem to be in some strange sort
of mood.

670
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,893
I'm sorry,is very rude
of me.

671
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,816
I seem to be unravelling.

672
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,850
- I shouldn't have come.
- No,is not you.

673
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:07,330
I's more like having a presentiment.
Do you know what I'm saying?

674
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,449
Oh God,is probably
just nerves about the party.

675
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,133
Bad hostess.

676
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,058
Clarissa, wha's happening?

677
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,296
Jesus.

678
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,779
What is it?

679
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:24,730
Oh God.

680
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,813
Do you want me to go?

681
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,891
No, don't go. Don't.

682
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:36,015
Don't go. Explain to me
why this is happening.

683
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,136
Don't...

684
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,657
Don't touch me.

685
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:43,773
I's better if you don't.

686
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,971
I's just too much.

687
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:52,018
You fly in from san Francisco,

688
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,058
and I've been nursing Richard
for years

689
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,417
and all that time
I've held myself together.

690
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,977
- No problem.
- I know.

691
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,733
One morning,

692
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,858
in Wellfleet,

693
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,648
you were there,
we were all there,

694
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:15,419
I'd been sleeping with him,
and I was out on the back porch.

695
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:20,210
He came out behind me,

696
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:23,293
and he put his hand
on my shoulder.

697
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,529
"Good morning, Mrs Dalloway."

698
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,576
Tha's...

699
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,538
from then
on I've been stuck.

700
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:40,617
stuck?

701
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,496
Yeah.

702
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,256
Yeah.

703
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,978
With the name, I mean.

704
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:54,092
And now you walk in.

705
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,252
To see you

706
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,819
walk in...

707
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:02,612
Because I never see you.
Look at you.

708
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:08,177
Anyway...
It doesn't matter.

709
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,257
It was you he stayed with.
It was you he lived with.

710
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,296
I had one summer.

711
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,531
The day I left him,

712
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:33,175
I got on a train
and made my way across Europe.

713
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:39,575
I felt free for the first time
in years.

714
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:58,096
so, tell me about san Francisco.

715
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:59,696
Wha's to tell?

716
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:03,298
I still teach drama to idiots.
Mostly.

717
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:04,814
They can't all be idiots.

718
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,210
No. No. In fact...

719
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,651
I shouldn't
tell you this...

720
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:11,134
I've fallen in love.

721
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,376
- Really?
- Yes.

722
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,417
- With a student.
- With a student.

723
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,936
Exactly. I know.
You...

724
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:25,377
You think: "Am I still up for
this?". All this intensity,

725
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,292
all those arguments.

726
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:30,008
Doors being slammed. Well, you
know whatis like.

727
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,891
Are you feeling better?

728
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,576
A little.

729
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,256
Thank you.

730
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,973
You think I'm ridiculous?

731
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,334
Ridiculous?

732
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:51,330
Fortunate... too.

733
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:24,616
I'm gonna leave you at Mrs Latch's.
I have to do something.

734
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:38,252
Mommy, I don't wanna go.

735
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,489
You have to.

736
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,498
I'm sorry. I have something
to do before daddy gets home.

737
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,654
Hello.

738
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,255
Hi, Mrs Latch,
My boy's not very happy.

739
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,456
Mommy,
I don't wanna do this.

740
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,412
I have to go, honey.

741
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:43,855
Your mommy has things to do.
Come in, I got cookies.

742
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:46,574
Okay, baby?

743
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,572
You have to be brave now.

744
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,814
Don't worry now,
he's gonna be fine.

745
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,254
Come on.

746
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:13,611
Honey.

747
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,891
Come on, darling.

748
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,498
Mommy!

749
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,492
- stop it.
- No!

750
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:44,936
Mommy!

751
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,209
- Mommy!
- Come inside.

752
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:51,130
Come on.

753
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,851
No!

754
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,209
<i>Breakfast</i>

755
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,974
<i>is served between seven
and eleven in the Regency Room.</i>

756
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:38,128
And room service is available
twenty-four hours.

757
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,694
Thank you, ma'am.

758
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:45,611
- Is there anything else you need?
- Yes.

759
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,939
No...
Not to be disturbed.

760
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:04,490
<i>Did it matter, then,
she asked herself,</i>

761
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,930
<i>walking toward Bond street,</i>

762
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:09,648
<i>did it matter that she must
inevitably,</i>

763
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,050
<i>cease completely</i>

764
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:15,737
<i>all this must go on
without her...</i>

765
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:19,011
<i>Did she resent it</i>

766
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,895
<i>or did it not
become consoling</i>

767
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:25,496
<i>to believe that death
ended absolutely?</i>

768
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:30,456
<i>It is possible to die.</i>

769
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:35,499
It is possible to die.

770
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:42,260
There was a lovely coat for Angelica
at Harrods, then nothing for the boys,

771
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,331
and it seemed so unfair.

772
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:45,979
Why should Angelica be favoured?

773
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,336
Virginia?

774
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,058
What are you thinking about?

775
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,696
Are you still with us?

776
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:27,730
Your aun's a very lucky woman,
Angelica,

777
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:31,855
because she has two lives.

778
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,295
she has the life she's leading,

779
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:36,849
and also the book
she's writing.

780
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,213
This makes her
very fortunate indeed.

781
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,091
What were you thinking about?

782
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:11,455
I was going to kill my heroine.

783
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:16,457
But...
I've changed my mind.

784
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,659
I can't.

785
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:36,971
I fear I may have to kill someone
else instead.

786
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:46,849
Quentin, I'm dropping them.

787
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:48,130
We're ready.

788
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:49,574
- Mind the shopping.
- I am minding the shopping.

789
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,253
It was a fascinating visit.

790
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,055
And they enjoyed it thoroughly.

791
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,774
Do you have to go already?

792
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,332
I do wish you wouldn't go.

793
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:03,937
The last thing you want
is our noisiness.

794
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:07,297
My hopeless,
clumsy boys.

795
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:10,811
- say goodbye, boys.
- Bye.

796
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:14,529
And you'll return to what?

797
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:16,334
Tonight?

798
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:21,215
Just some
insufferable dinner

799
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:24,098
that not even you could envy,
Virginia.

800
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:25,659
But I do.

801
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:04,098
say something, Nessa.
Didn't you think I seemed better?

802
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:09,218
Yes, Virginia, you seem better.

803
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:24,529
You think?

804
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,772
You think I may one day escape?

805
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,374
One day. One.

806
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:34,536
Nessa.

807
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:39,649
Come on, Nessa.

808
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,253
Come, Angelica, we must go.

809
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:44,211
Come on.

810
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,609
Goodbye.

811
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:47,699
Goodbye, little girl.

812
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:51,371
Angelica, the train.

813
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:55,698
We're gonna miss the train.

814
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,891
Come on,
I wanna go home.

815
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,608
We've stayed too long,
we've missed the train.

816
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:12,737
stay close.

817
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,173
I'm sorry, I know.

818
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:38,971
I tried to get here earlier.
Don't start.

819
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:42,656
I know,is incredibly
important becauseis your party.

820
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:44,654
Julia...

821
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,695
- How have you been doing?
- I'm fine.

822
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:48,531
Come here.

823
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:51,298
What have you been doing?

824
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:54,250
Well, studying, mom.

825
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:01,370
so, what should I do?
Chairs?

826
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,612
No, le's clear the desk first.

827
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:06,090
We can take it
into the bedroom.

828
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:08,851
I bumped into Louis Waters.

829
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:11,331
Oh, you did? Where?

830
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:12,296
In the street.

831
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:17,849
They're all here, aren't they?
All the ghosts.

832
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:21,217
All the ghosts are assembling
for the party.

833
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:24,217
He's so weird.

834
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,014
Oh, what?
You can't see that?

835
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:31,172
You can't see that
Louis Waters is weird?

836
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,052
I can see that he's sad.

837
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:39,415
Well,
all your friends are sad.

838
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:43,293
You've been crying.
Wha's happening?

839
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,410
All it is
I looked around this room,

840
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:50,649
and I thought:

841
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:54,779
"I'm giving a party. All I
wanna do is give a party".

842
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:57,215
And?

843
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,813
He does it deliberately.

844
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:02,093
Is this Richard?

845
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:06,970
He did it this morning.
He gives me that look.

846
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,410
What look?

847
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,294
To say:

848
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:15,537
"Your life is trivial.

849
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:19,574
You are so trivial".

850
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:21,976
Just

851
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:25,851
daily stuff, schedules
and parties and details.

852
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,570
Tha's what he means by it.
That is what he's saying.

853
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:31,731
Mom, it only matters
if you thinkis true.

854
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:34,936
Well?

855
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:36,849
Do you? Tell me.

856
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,410
When I'm with him I feel

857
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:48,138
yes, I am living.

858
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,210
And when I'm not with him,

859
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:56,218
yes, everything does seem
sort of...

860
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:58,010
silly.

861
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:05,930
I don't mean with you. I...

862
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:08,171
God. Jesus.

863
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:12,938
Never with you.
I's all the rest of it.

864
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:19,216
sally?

865
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:23,694
The rest of it.

866
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:29,211
False comfort.

867
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:30,536
Because?

868
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:34,530
If you say to me
"When were you happiest?",

869
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:36,975
"Tell me the moment
you were happiest..."

870
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:39,336
I know, it was years ago.

871
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,694
Yeah.

872
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:47,776
All you're saying is
you were once young.

873
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:56,059
I remember one morning

874
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:58,214
getting up at dawn.

875
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,412
There was such a sense
of possibility.

876
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,970
You know?
That feeling?

877
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:07,810
And I remember thinking
to myself:

878
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:11,735
"so this is the beginning
of happiness.

879
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:15,450
This is where it starts. And, of
course, there'll always be more."

880
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:21,208
It never occurred to me

881
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:24,571
it wasn't the beginning.

882
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,939
It was happiness.

883
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:32,534
It was 'the momen'.

884
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:36,019
Right then.

885
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:00,932
Nelly, good evening. I was
wondering if you'd seen Mrs Woolf.

886
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:04,898
I thought you knew,
sir. Mrs Woolf has gone out.

887
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:41,853
Excuse me, excuse me.

888
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:44,170
Very kind, sir, thank you.
Papers.

889
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:48,734
Papers.

890
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:10,095
Mr Woolf, what
an unexpected pleasure.

891
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:13,457
Perhaps you could tell me exactly
what you think you're doing?

892
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:14,735
What I was doing?

893
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,049
I went to look for you
and you weren't there.

894
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,571
You were working in the garden.
I didn't wish to disturb you.

895
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:20,299
You disturb me when you disappear.

896
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:22,531
I didn't disappear.

897
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,975
- I went for a walk.
- A walk?

898
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,653
Is that all, just a walk?

899
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:31,372
We must go home now.

900
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,815
Nelly's cooking dinner. she's
already had a very difficult day.

901
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:35,539
I's our obligation
to eat Nelly's dinner.

902
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:37,896
There is no such obligation.

903
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,172
No such obligation exists.

904
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:42,739
Virginia, you have an obligation
to your own sanity.

905
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:44,857
I've endured this custody.

906
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:47,252
I've endured this imprisonment.

907
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:51,294
Oh, Virginia! I am attended
by doctors, everywhere.

908
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:55,499
I am attended by doctors who inform
me of my own interests.

909
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:56,730
They know your interests.

910
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:59,699
They do not speak
for my interests.

911
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:03,331
I can see that it must be hard
for a woman of your...

912
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:05,172
Of my what exactly?

913
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:06,250
Your talents,

914
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,378
to see that she may not be the
best judge of her own condition.

915
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:11,417
Who then is a better judge?

916
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:12,649
You have a history!

917
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,211
You have a history of confinement.

918
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:18,928
We brought you to Richmond because
you've a history of fits,

919
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:20,408
moods,

920
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:22,491
blackouts,
hearing voices.

921
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:24,259
We brought you here to save you

922
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:27,213
from the irrevocable damage you
intended upon yourself.

923
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:31,098
You've tried
to kill yourself twice!

924
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,535
I live daily with that threat.
I set up the press,

925
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:40,294
we set up the printing press
not just for itself,

926
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:43,977
not just purely for itself,
but so that you might have

927
01:17:44,220 --> 01:17:47,053
a ready source of absorption
and of remedy.

928
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:48,574
Like needlework?

929
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,292
It was done for you!

930
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:54,050
It was done
for your betterment!

931
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,052
It was done out of love!

932
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:01,458
If I didn't know you better,
I'd call this ingratitude.

933
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,811
I am ungrateful?

934
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:06,537
You call me ungrateful?

935
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,728
My life has been stolen from me.

936
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:18,659
I'm living in a town I have
no wish to live in. I'm living

937
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:21,698
a life I have no wish
to live.

938
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:27,938
How did this happen?

939
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:43,979
It is time for us
to move back to London.

940
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:50,778
I miss London.

941
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,456
I miss London life.

942
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:58,978
This is not you speaking,
Virginia.

943
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,448
This is an aspect
of your illness.

944
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:01,490
I's not you.

945
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:04,658
It is my voice.
It is mine and mine alone.

946
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:06,174
It is the voice that you hear.

947
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:08,775
It is not, it is mine!

948
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,817
I'm dying in this town!

949
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:18,008
If you were thinking clearly,
Virginia, you'd recall

950
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:19,409
it was London
that brought you low.

951
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,730
If I were thinking clearly?

952
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:26,174
If I were thinking clearly.

953
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:28,575
We brought you
to Richmond to give you peace.

954
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:32,616
If I were thinking clearly,
Leonard, I would tell you

955
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:36,489
that I wrestle alone in the
dark, in the deep dark,

956
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:38,378
and that only I can know,

957
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:42,215
only I can understand
my own condition.

958
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:46,490
You live with the threat
of my extinction.

959
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:49,216
Leonard,

960
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:51,454
I live with it too.

961
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,579
This is my right.

962
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:59,696
It is the right
of every human being.

963
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:03,410
I choose not the suffocating
anaesthetic of the suburbs,

964
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:07,209
but the violent jolt of the
capital. That is my choice.

965
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,731
The meanest patient,
even the very lowest

966
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:12,016
is allowed some say

967
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:14,256
in the matter
of her own prescription.

968
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,255
Thereby she defines her humanity.

969
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,809
I wish for your sake,

970
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:31,409
I could be happy
in this quietness.

971
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:36,336
8ut if it is a choice

972
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,610
between Richmond and death

973
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:40,691
I choose death.

974
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:53,052
Very well. London, then.

975
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,538
We go back to London.

976
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,813
Are you hungry?

977
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:39,211
I'm a little hungry myself.

978
01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:00,254
Come along.

979
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:03,251
The London train on platform one.

980
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:08,254
This is the London train
terminating at Vauxhall.

981
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:16,379
You cannot find peace by avoiding
life, Leonard.

982
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:26,376
This is the London train.

983
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,898
This is the London train
on platform one.

984
01:22:45,523 --> 01:22:46,922
Mommy!

985
01:22:48,763 --> 01:22:50,799
Mommy!

986
01:23:00,323 --> 01:23:01,802
Hey there, bug.

987
01:23:04,043 --> 01:23:05,556
Wha's wrong?
Hi, Mrs Latch.

988
01:23:06,163 --> 01:23:07,755
sorry I'm late.

989
01:23:08,003 --> 01:23:10,233
He's fine. He's been fine.
He's just happy to see you.

990
01:23:10,643 --> 01:23:12,520
It couldn't have been
that bad, could it?

991
01:23:12,883 --> 01:23:14,202
so you got it cut, then?

992
01:23:14,443 --> 01:23:16,081
Yes. No problem.

993
01:23:16,323 --> 01:23:16,994
Looks great.

994
01:23:17,243 --> 01:23:18,437
They didn't have
to do very much.

995
01:23:18,843 --> 01:23:21,482
Well, we had a fine time
together.

996
01:23:22,643 --> 01:23:24,395
Thank you very much.

997
01:23:29,203 --> 01:23:31,637
so that wasn't too bad,
was it?

998
01:23:32,043 --> 01:23:33,761
I wasn't gone too long.

999
01:23:34,523 --> 01:23:35,842
No, you weren't long.

1000
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:37,277
Tha's right.

1001
01:23:40,443 --> 01:23:41,922
At one point,

1002
01:23:43,403 --> 01:23:44,722
I don't know,

1003
01:23:47,603 --> 01:23:50,356
there was a moment
where I thought I might be longer.

1004
01:23:52,323 --> 01:23:54,120
But I changed my mind.

1005
01:24:01,843 --> 01:24:02,514
What is it, honey?

1006
01:24:03,483 --> 01:24:05,633
Mommy, I love you.

1007
01:24:07,843 --> 01:24:09,834
I love you too, baby.

1008
01:24:18,483 --> 01:24:19,677
Wha's wrong?

1009
01:24:23,923 --> 01:24:24,594
What?

1010
01:24:32,203 --> 01:24:33,397
Don't worry, honey,
everything's fine.

1011
01:24:34,323 --> 01:24:36,120
We're gonna have a wonderful party.

1012
01:24:37,723 --> 01:24:40,396
And we've made your daddy
such a nice cake.

1013
01:24:45,483 --> 01:24:46,757
I love you, sweetheart.

1014
01:24:49,043 --> 01:24:50,192
You're my guy.

1015
01:25:25,323 --> 01:25:27,154
<i>Mommy!</i>

1016
01:25:28,443 --> 01:25:30,240
Mommy!

1017
01:26:24,603 --> 01:26:27,276
Richard,is me.
I'm early.

1018
01:26:32,283 --> 01:26:34,592
What the hell is going on here?

1019
01:26:38,923 --> 01:26:40,675
What are you doing here?
You're early.

1020
01:26:43,163 --> 01:26:44,482
What is going on here?
What are you doing?

1021
01:26:44,723 --> 01:26:47,715
I had this wonderful idea.

1022
01:26:47,963 --> 01:26:49,555
I needed to let in some light!

1023
01:26:49,803 --> 01:26:52,192
Richard, what are you doing?

1024
01:26:52,443 --> 01:26:54,673
I had this fantastic notion.

1025
01:26:55,323 --> 01:26:58,201
I took the Xanax and the Ritalin
together. It had never occurred to me.

1026
01:26:59,123 --> 01:26:59,999
Don't come near me!

1027
01:27:05,883 --> 01:27:09,592
It seemed to me I needed
to let in some light.

1028
01:27:12,563 --> 01:27:13,313
What do you think?

1029
01:27:13,683 --> 01:27:15,719
I cleared away all the windows.

1030
01:27:15,963 --> 01:27:19,433
All right, Richard, do me one
simple favour. Come...

1031
01:27:19,723 --> 01:27:20,280
Come.

1032
01:27:20,483 --> 01:27:22,235
I don't think I can make it
to the party, Clarissa.

1033
01:27:22,443 --> 01:27:24,718
You don't have to go to the party.
You don't have to go to the ceremony.

1034
01:27:24,963 --> 01:27:26,362
You don't have to do anything you
don't want to do.

1035
01:27:26,603 --> 01:27:27,922
You can do as you like.

1036
01:27:28,163 --> 01:27:30,631
But I still have
to face the hours, don't I?

1037
01:27:30,883 --> 01:27:33,158
I mean, the hours
after the party.

1038
01:27:33,403 --> 01:27:35,155
And the hours after that.

1039
01:27:36,563 --> 01:27:39,919
You do have good days still,
you know you do.

1040
01:27:40,363 --> 01:27:41,512
Not really.

1041
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:45,040
I mean,is kind of
you to say so, butis not

1042
01:27:45,283 --> 01:27:46,318
really true.

1043
01:27:55,963 --> 01:27:57,476
- Are they here?
- Who?

1044
01:27:57,723 --> 01:27:58,280
The voices?

1045
01:27:59,283 --> 01:28:01,080
The voices are always here.

1046
01:28:02,603 --> 01:28:04,719
Andis the voices that
you're hearing now, isn't it?

1047
01:28:04,963 --> 01:28:06,157
No, no...

1048
01:28:07,283 --> 01:28:09,592
Mrs Dalloway,is you.

1049
01:28:14,323 --> 01:28:16,518
I've stayed alive for you.

1050
01:28:17,603 --> 01:28:19,480
But now you have to let me go.

1051
01:28:21,763 --> 01:28:23,196
- Richard, I...
- No, wait.

1052
01:28:24,243 --> 01:28:25,119
Wait.

1053
01:28:29,163 --> 01:28:30,039
Tell me a story.

1054
01:28:30,803 --> 01:28:31,679
What about?

1055
01:28:32,363 --> 01:28:34,593
Tell me a story from your day.

1056
01:28:36,723 --> 01:28:38,395
I got up...

1057
01:28:39,403 --> 01:28:40,040
Yes?

1058
01:28:40,283 --> 01:28:43,434
...and I went out. And...

1059
01:28:44,683 --> 01:28:48,198
I went to buy flowers. Like
Mrs Dalloway in the book, you know?

1060
01:28:48,843 --> 01:28:49,593
Yes.

1061
01:28:49,843 --> 01:28:50,719
And it was a beautiful morning.

1062
01:28:51,283 --> 01:28:52,193
Was it?

1063
01:28:52,443 --> 01:28:55,879
Yes, it was so beautiful.
It was so fresh.

1064
01:28:56,123 --> 01:28:58,591
- Oh, fresh, was it?
- Yes.

1065
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:02,799
Like a...

1066
01:29:04,683 --> 01:29:06,514
Like a morning on the beach?

1067
01:29:07,323 --> 01:29:08,199
- Yes.
- Like that?

1068
01:29:09,203 --> 01:29:10,033
Yes.

1069
01:29:10,283 --> 01:29:13,355
Like that morning when you walked
out of that old house and you were...

1070
01:29:13,603 --> 01:29:16,959
You were eighteen and maybe
I was nineteen.

1071
01:29:18,243 --> 01:29:18,800
Yes.

1072
01:29:19,963 --> 01:29:21,999
I was nineteen years old

1073
01:29:22,243 --> 01:29:25,474
and I'd never seen anything
so beautiful.

1074
01:29:27,603 --> 01:29:31,562
You coming out of a glass door in
the early morning, still sleepy.

1075
01:29:33,403 --> 01:29:34,472
Isn't it strange?

1076
01:29:36,443 --> 01:29:39,515
The most ordinary morning
in anybody's life.

1077
01:29:43,443 --> 01:29:45,559
I'm afraid I can't make it
to the party, Clarissa.

1078
01:29:46,723 --> 01:29:48,315
The party

1079
01:29:49,283 --> 01:29:50,875
doesn't matter.

1080
01:29:51,443 --> 01:29:54,116
You've been so good to me,
Mrs Dalloway.

1081
01:29:56,763 --> 01:29:58,435
I love you.

1082
01:30:03,763 --> 01:30:07,199
I don't think two people could have
been happier than we've been.

1083
01:30:15,043 --> 01:30:15,873
Oh God, no!

1084
01:30:24,363 --> 01:30:25,876
Happy birthday.

1085
01:30:26,683 --> 01:30:29,277
- Happy birthday, Dan.
- This is perfect.

1086
01:30:29,523 --> 01:30:31,002
This is just perfect.

1087
01:30:31,683 --> 01:30:33,162
Do you think so?

1088
01:30:33,403 --> 01:30:35,553
- Do you really think so?
- Why, sure.

1089
01:30:35,803 --> 01:30:38,795
- You must have been working all day.
- Well, tha's what we were doing.

1090
01:30:39,043 --> 01:30:41,921
Weren't we, bug?
We were working all day.

1091
01:30:42,763 --> 01:30:44,276
This is just fantastic.

1092
01:30:45,443 --> 01:30:46,956
I's what I've always wanted.

1093
01:30:47,203 --> 01:30:50,036
One day, Richie, I'll tell you
how it all happened.

1094
01:30:51,083 --> 01:30:51,959
Don't.

1095
01:30:52,203 --> 01:30:55,559
I want to. I wanna tell him
the story.

1096
01:30:55,963 --> 01:30:56,952
What happened

1097
01:30:58,803 --> 01:31:00,953
when I was in the war, at war
I found myself

1098
01:31:01,643 --> 01:31:03,793
thinking about this girl
I'd seen.

1099
01:31:04,043 --> 01:31:05,920
I'd never met her
at high school.

1100
01:31:08,243 --> 01:31:09,596
This strange,

1101
01:31:09,803 --> 01:31:12,875
fragile-looking girl
named Laura McGrath.

1102
01:31:14,923 --> 01:31:15,958
Yeah.

1103
01:31:16,203 --> 01:31:17,033
And she was shy.

1104
01:31:18,563 --> 01:31:20,554
And she was interesting.

1105
01:31:20,803 --> 01:31:22,873
And well, your mother won't
mind if I tell you this, Richie,

1106
01:31:23,123 --> 01:31:26,957
she was the sort of girl that
you see sitting mostly on her own.

1107
01:31:27,203 --> 01:31:28,192
And, I tell you

1108
01:31:28,723 --> 01:31:30,679
sometimes when I was in the
south Pacific,

1109
01:31:32,603 --> 01:31:35,276
the fact is, that I used
to think about this girl.

1110
01:31:35,523 --> 01:31:36,239
Dan...

1111
01:31:37,123 --> 01:31:39,557
I used to think about bringing her
to a house,

1112
01:31:41,003 --> 01:31:42,561
to a life,

1113
01:31:43,323 --> 01:31:44,881
pretty much like this.

1114
01:31:47,123 --> 01:31:49,000
And it was the thought
of the happiness,

1115
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:53,879
the thought of this woman,

1116
01:31:54,123 --> 01:31:56,762
the thought of this life,
tha's what kept me going.

1117
01:31:58,283 --> 01:32:00,558
I had an idea of our happiness.

1118
01:32:27,763 --> 01:32:29,321
<i>Why does someone have
to die?</i>

1119
01:32:33,803 --> 01:32:34,679
Leonard?

1120
01:32:34,923 --> 01:32:37,039
In your book. You said
someone had to die.

1121
01:32:37,843 --> 01:32:39,037
Why?

1122
01:32:41,803 --> 01:32:43,794
Is that a stupid question?

1123
01:32:44,163 --> 01:32:45,152
No.

1124
01:32:45,403 --> 01:32:46,518
I imagine my question
is stupid.

1125
01:32:48,883 --> 01:32:50,157
Not at all.

1126
01:32:51,803 --> 01:32:52,679
Well?

1127
01:32:56,563 --> 01:33:00,522
someone has to die in order that
the rest of us should value life more.

1128
01:33:02,123 --> 01:33:03,715
I's contrast.

1129
01:33:04,523 --> 01:33:05,876
And who will die?

1130
01:33:08,323 --> 01:33:09,199
Tell me.

1131
01:33:11,963 --> 01:33:13,919
The poet will die.

1132
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:16,482
The visionary.

1133
01:33:31,243 --> 01:33:32,232
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1134
01:33:33,283 --> 01:33:35,239
I'm brushing my teeth.

1135
01:33:39,283 --> 01:33:40,511
Are you coming to bed?

1136
01:33:41,523 --> 01:33:43,354
Yeah, in a minute.

1137
01:33:45,323 --> 01:33:47,917
Come to bed, Laura Brown.

1138
01:33:52,283 --> 01:33:55,673
I ran into Ray. He said Kitty
had to go to the hospital.

1139
01:33:57,083 --> 01:33:58,277
I know.

1140
01:33:59,003 --> 01:34:01,836
It was nothing serious, he said.
Just a check-up.

1141
01:34:03,723 --> 01:34:05,361
I'm terrified.

1142
01:34:06,043 --> 01:34:06,919
Why?

1143
01:34:10,123 --> 01:34:12,921
The idea she could disappear.

1144
01:34:15,163 --> 01:34:16,642
Maybe you could go see her
in the morning, honey.

1145
01:34:24,963 --> 01:34:28,080
I was going to.
I was gonna stop by.

1146
01:34:28,843 --> 01:34:31,118
I've had a wonderful day.

1147
01:34:32,403 --> 01:34:34,473
And I have you to thank.

1148
01:34:41,043 --> 01:34:42,556
Come to bed, honey.

1149
01:34:43,683 --> 01:34:45,036
I'm coming.

1150
01:34:53,803 --> 01:34:55,202
so are you coming?

1151
01:34:56,803 --> 01:34:57,679
Yes.

1152
01:35:17,003 --> 01:35:17,879
What?

1153
01:35:21,443 --> 01:35:23,001
I was hoping you were going
to bed.

1154
01:35:23,763 --> 01:35:26,994
I am...
I am going to bed.

1155
01:35:30,043 --> 01:35:31,271
What, then?

1156
01:35:34,363 --> 01:35:36,035
All else is clear.

1157
01:35:37,003 --> 01:35:39,995
The outline of the story is
planned. Now one thing only.

1158
01:35:40,843 --> 01:35:43,755
Mrs Dalloway's destiny
must be resolved.

1159
01:36:23,803 --> 01:36:25,521
You're Laura Brown.

1160
01:36:28,003 --> 01:36:30,312
Yes. I'm Richarďs mother.

1161
01:36:33,323 --> 01:36:34,517
Of course.

1162
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:40,155
I'm Clarissa Vaughan.
Please, come in.

1163
01:36:48,843 --> 01:36:49,753
My friend sally

1164
01:36:50,003 --> 01:36:51,436
is in the kitchen.

1165
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:53,202
And my daughter.

1166
01:36:53,883 --> 01:36:55,521
I'll take this.

1167
01:36:56,163 --> 01:36:58,438
We were having a party.

1168
01:36:59,523 --> 01:37:01,639
We were going to have a party.

1169
01:37:01,963 --> 01:37:04,682
I was lucky, I got the last plane
from Toronto.

1170
01:37:06,323 --> 01:37:08,712
so tha's the monster.

1171
01:37:09,563 --> 01:37:11,315
I hope I did the right thing.

1172
01:37:11,563 --> 01:37:13,281
I found your number
in his phone book.

1173
01:37:14,443 --> 01:37:16,354
Yes, he had it.

1174
01:37:17,923 --> 01:37:20,039
We didn't speak often.

1175
01:37:31,803 --> 01:37:34,237
I's a terrible thing,
Ms Vaughan,

1176
01:37:34,923 --> 01:37:36,322
to outlive your whole family.

1177
01:37:40,163 --> 01:37:42,119
Richarďs father died.

1178
01:37:42,363 --> 01:37:44,479
Yes, he died
of cancer quite young...

1179
01:37:46,363 --> 01:37:48,638
And Richarďs sister is dead.

1180
01:37:54,083 --> 01:37:56,677
Obviously you feel unworthy.

1181
01:37:57,003 --> 01:38:00,120
It gives you feelings...
of unworthiness.

1182
01:38:01,163 --> 01:38:03,802
You survive and they don't.

1183
01:38:08,283 --> 01:38:10,160
Have you read the poems?

1184
01:38:10,803 --> 01:38:11,997
Oh, yes.

1185
01:38:14,403 --> 01:38:16,234
I also read the novel.

1186
01:38:24,083 --> 01:38:25,277
You see,

1187
01:38:26,283 --> 01:38:28,478
people say the novel's
difficult.

1188
01:38:31,203 --> 01:38:32,079
I know.

1189
01:38:33,083 --> 01:38:33,959
They say that.

1190
01:38:39,043 --> 01:38:40,237
I know.

1191
01:38:43,723 --> 01:38:45,714
He had me die in the novel.

1192
01:38:46,283 --> 01:38:48,478
I know why he did that.

1193
01:38:53,683 --> 01:38:56,880
It hurt, of course, I can't
pretend it didn't hurt. But I...

1194
01:38:57,123 --> 01:38:59,000
I know why he did it.

1195
01:39:02,723 --> 01:39:06,193
You left Richard,
when he was a child.

1196
01:39:08,723 --> 01:39:10,918
I left both my children.

1197
01:39:13,203 --> 01:39:15,034
I abandoned them.

1198
01:39:21,083 --> 01:39:23,643
They sayis the worst thing
a mother can do.

1199
01:39:28,683 --> 01:39:29,559
Yeah.

1200
01:39:37,483 --> 01:39:38,438
You have a daughter.

1201
01:39:42,123 --> 01:39:42,999
Yes.

1202
01:39:44,963 --> 01:39:47,238
But I never met Julia's father.

1203
01:39:47,483 --> 01:39:49,439
You so wanted a child?

1204
01:39:51,163 --> 01:39:52,357
Tha's right.

1205
01:39:55,243 --> 01:39:56,596
You're a lucky woman.

1206
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:08,313
There are times
when you don't belong

1207
01:40:08,563 --> 01:40:11,031
and you think you're going
to kill yourself.

1208
01:40:17,403 --> 01:40:19,394
Once I went to a hotel...

1209
01:40:23,203 --> 01:40:25,797
Later that night I made a plan.

1210
01:40:26,563 --> 01:40:28,872
The plan was I would leave
my family

1211
01:40:29,123 --> 01:40:31,193
when my second child was born.

1212
01:40:33,163 --> 01:40:35,119
And tha's what I did.

1213
01:40:36,603 --> 01:40:38,514
I got up one morning,

1214
01:40:39,123 --> 01:40:40,681
made breakfast,

1215
01:40:42,003 --> 01:40:43,755
went to the bus-stop,

1216
01:40:45,003 --> 01:40:46,595
got on the bus.

1217
01:40:48,843 --> 01:40:50,401
I'd left a note.

1218
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:59,075
I got a job in a library
in Canada.

1219
01:41:06,363 --> 01:41:07,239
It would

1220
01:41:09,643 --> 01:41:12,476
be wonderful
to say you regretted it.

1221
01:41:13,483 --> 01:41:14,962
It would be easy.

1222
01:41:20,323 --> 01:41:22,154
But what does it mean?

1223
01:41:23,483 --> 01:41:25,599
What does it mean to regret

1224
01:41:27,043 --> 01:41:29,273
when you have no choice?

1225
01:41:39,563 --> 01:41:41,599
I's what you can bear.

1226
01:41:47,363 --> 01:41:48,955
There it is.

1227
01:41:49,323 --> 01:41:51,393
No-one's going to forgive me.

1228
01:41:57,683 --> 01:41:59,480
It was death.

1229
01:42:01,923 --> 01:42:03,754
I chose life.

1230
01:43:02,003 --> 01:43:03,834
Time to take your coat off.

1231
01:43:46,283 --> 01:43:48,001
I thought you might
like a cup of tea.

1232
01:43:48,243 --> 01:43:51,519
Oh my goodness...
Thank you, dear.

1233
01:43:52,123 --> 01:43:53,681
I feel like I'm stealing
your room.

1234
01:43:55,923 --> 01:43:58,391
We put the food away, so if you're
at all hungry in the night,

1235
01:43:58,643 --> 01:44:00,873
- just help yourself.
- I will.

1236
01:44:01,323 --> 01:44:03,518
- Where will you sleep?
- Oh, the sofa.

1237
01:44:04,843 --> 01:44:06,674
Oh, I'm sorry.

1238
01:44:14,723 --> 01:44:15,951
Goodnight, sweetheart.

1239
01:44:17,323 --> 01:44:18,199
Goodnight.

1240
01:44:38,643 --> 01:44:39,996
<i>Dear Leonard,</i>

1241
01:44:41,843 --> 01:44:44,198
<i>to look life in the face,</i>

1242
01:44:47,043 --> 01:44:50,160
<i>always to look life
in the face.</i>

1243
01:44:51,643 --> 01:44:53,361
<i>And to know it</i>

1244
01:44:53,963 --> 01:44:55,601
<i>for what it is.</i>

1245
01:44:56,803 --> 01:44:58,441
<i>At last,</i>

1246
01:44:59,483 --> 01:45:00,962

1248
01:45:05,563 --> 01:45:06,882

01:45:27,123 --> 01:45:28,317
<i>always</i>

1254
01:45:29,963 --> 01:45:31,157
<i>the love,</i>

1255
01:45:32,283 --> 01:45:33,477
<i>always</i>

1256
01:45:35,523 --> 01:45:37,354
<i>the hours.</i>
