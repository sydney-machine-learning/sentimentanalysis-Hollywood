1
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:33,974
PUKCH`ONG COAST, NORTH KOREA

2
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:50,060
Look, what is this? I`m supposed to...

3
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:36,901
Colonel Tan-Sun Moon`s HQ
De-Militarised Zone, North Korea

4
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:46,901
Open the bag.

5
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:54,262
That will teach you to lecture me.

6
00:04:06,382 --> 00:04:07,662
Retract the blast doors.

7
00:04:12,422 --> 00:04:14,622
Find me a new anger therapist.

8
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:39,224
I am Zao.

9
00:04:39,343 --> 00:04:40,904
You are late.

10
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:46,224
Mr Van Bierk. l`ve been
looking forward to this meeting.

11
00:04:46,344 --> 00:04:48,544
Me, too.

12
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:52,864
My African military friends
owe you many thanks, Colonel Moon.

13
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:56,624
Few men have the guts to trade
conflict diamonds since the UN embargo.

14
00:04:56,704 --> 00:05:00,064
I know all about the UN.
I studied at Oxford and Harvard.

15
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:02,985
Majored in Western hypocrisy.

16
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:08,944
From your modest little collection of cars,
I would never have guessed.

17
00:05:10,864 --> 00:05:14,225
- Show me the diamonds.
- Show me the weapons.

18
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:19,545
Bring the weapons.

19
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:36,225
Hiding weapons in the demilitarised zone.
It`s a bit of a minefield out there.

20
00:05:36,345 --> 00:05:38,706
America`s cultural contribution.

21
00:05:38,825 --> 00:05:43,666
One million land mines,
and my hovercrafts float right over them.

22
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:01,387
RPGs, flamethrowers, automatic weapons

23
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:03,867
and enough ammunition
to run a small war.

24
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:06,467
My diamonds?

25
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:11,307
Check it over quick.

26
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:24,147
- Don`t blow it all at once.
- I`ve special plans for this consignment.

27
00:06:39,748 --> 00:06:42,268
His name is James Bond.
A British assassin.

28
00:06:52,348 --> 00:06:54,789
Mr Van Bierk,
let me show you something.

29
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:00,629
Our new tank buster.

30
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:04,589
- Depleted uranium shells, naturally.
- Naturally.

31
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,469
And how do you propose to kill me now...

32
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,510
Mr Bond?

33
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,950
It`s pathetic that you British still believe
you have the right to police the world.

34
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,710
But you will not live to see the day
all Korea is ruled by the North.

35
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,391
Then you and I
have something in common.

36
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,271
Who is it?

37
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,830
Where`s my son?

38
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:44,271
It`s the General.

39
00:07:47,311 --> 00:07:47,951
Hello, Father.

40
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:49,231
Why is there a fire?

41
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:51,231
I`ll be there in five minutes.

42
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:55,391
Get the weapons out of here...

43
00:07:55,511 --> 00:07:56,311
and kill the spy.

44
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,721
Saved by the bell.

45
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:23,081
My son is dead.

46
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:07,609
1 4 months later

47
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,890
I don`t condone what they do here.

48
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,930
Tell it to the concierge.

49
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:46,291
Still you jest.

50
00:16:46,931 --> 00:16:48,971
Defiant to the last.

51
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:52,012
Your people have abandoned you.

52
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:55,371
Your very existence denied.

53
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:59,412
Why stay silent?

54
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:05,771
It doesn`t matter any more.

55
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:08,371
Things are out of my hands.

56
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:49,614
We reach the end, Mr Bond.

57
00:17:50,454 --> 00:17:52,573
Spare me the unpleasantries.

58
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:59,214
50 years after the superpowers
carved Korea in two.

59
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:01,774
And then you arrive.

60
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:04,614
A British spy. An assassin.

61
00:18:06,534 --> 00:18:12,294
And now the hardliners have their proof
we cannot trust the West.

62
00:18:15,015 --> 00:18:16,655
You...

63
00:18:18,454 --> 00:18:20,335
You took away my son.

64
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:24,175
Your firing squad
should have done the job for me.

65
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:34,575
I hoped a Western education would help
him become a bridge between our worlds.

66
00:18:35,535 --> 00:18:39,095
But all it did was to corrupt him.

67
00:18:39,655 --> 00:18:41,815
Let`s get this over with, shall we?

68
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:45,456
My son had an ally in the West.

69
00:18:48,056 --> 00:18:50,695
For the last time, who was it?

70
00:18:50,936 --> 00:18:53,575
Who made him betray
his country and his name?

71
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:56,936
The same person who betrayed me.

72
00:18:59,856 --> 00:19:01,816
Turn around!

73
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,456
Start walking.

74
00:19:34,018 --> 00:19:36,657
Keep walking, please.

75
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:38,337
Keep moving.

76
00:19:52,938 --> 00:19:54,658
Zao!

77
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:56,698
I`m being traded.

78
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:03,698
- For you.
- Keep moving. Keep walking, please.

79
00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:05,618
Your time will come.

80
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:07,859
Not as soon as yours.

81
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:12,458
Keep walking, please.

82
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,859
Look at him.

83
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,739
You`d think he was some kind of a hero.

84
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,820
OK, hold him tight.

85
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,580
- Watch his legs now.
- All right, let`s go.

86
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,540
No biological agents
in the prelim scan. He`s clean.

87
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,301
Pulse 72.
Blood pressure 120 over 80.

88
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:07,860
Indications of neurotoxins, histamine,
serotonin, enzyme inhibitors.

89
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:09,541
Scorpion venom.

90
00:21:09,661 --> 00:21:12,061
Also traces of a venom antiserum.

91
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:14,621
They`d sting him,
then administer the antidote.

92
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:17,621
Yet his internal organs seem unaffected.

93
00:21:17,702 --> 00:21:21,061
Liver not too good.
It`s definitely him, then.

94
00:21:26,022 --> 00:21:27,822
Morning.

95
00:21:40,623 --> 00:21:42,582
Welcome back.

96
00:21:50,783 --> 00:21:52,742
Such hospitality.

97
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:04,663
You don`t seem too pleased to see me.

98
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:08,263
If I`d had my way,
you`d still be in North Korea.

99
00:22:10,023 --> 00:22:12,304
Your freedom came at too high a price.

100
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:16,343
Zao.

101
00:22:16,463 --> 00:22:19,264
He tried to blow up a summit
between South Korea and China.

102
00:22:19,384 --> 00:22:22,343
Took out three Chinese agents
before he was caught.

103
00:22:23,224 --> 00:22:25,184
And now he`s free.

104
00:22:26,984 --> 00:22:29,464
I never asked to be traded.

105
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:33,064
- I`d rather die in prison than let him loose.
- You had your cyanide.

106
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:35,744
Threw it away years ago.
What the hell is this about?

107
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:41,424
The top US agent in the North Korean
High Command was executed last week.

108
00:22:41,544 --> 00:22:45,024
The Americans intercepted a signal
from your prison naming him.

109
00:22:45,144 --> 00:22:48,385
- And they think it`s me?
- You were the only inmate.

110
00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:52,425
They concluded you cracked
and were haemorrhaging information.

111
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:54,745
We had to get you out.

112
00:22:58,665 --> 00:23:00,625
And what do you think?

113
00:23:09,545 --> 00:23:12,545
With drugs, you wouldn`t know
what you did or didn`t say.

114
00:23:12,906 --> 00:23:14,986
I know the rules.

115
00:23:15,106 --> 00:23:18,666
And number one is no deals.
Get caught and you`re given up.

116
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:23,266
The mission was compromised.

117
00:23:23,386 --> 00:23:25,626
Moon got a call exposing me.

118
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:29,267
He had a partner in the West.
Even his father knew about it.

119
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:33,466
- Whether that`s true or not, it`s irrelevant.
- No, it isn`t.

120
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:38,106
The same person who set me up then
has just set me up again to get Zao out.

121
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:39,787
So I`m going after him.

122
00:23:40,146 --> 00:23:43,667
The only place you`re going
is our evaluation centre in the Falklands.

123
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:47,507
- Double-O status rescinded.
- Along with my freedom?

124
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:49,627
For as long as I deem necessary, yes.

125
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,508
You`re no use to anyone now.

126
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:04,630
- He`s gone into cardiac arrest.
- Crash trolley. Notify his superiors. Now!

127
00:25:04,749 --> 00:25:07,030
He`s flatlining on the ECG.

128
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,990
200 joules. 300.

129
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,390
Get me some atropine. We`re losing him!

130
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,471
Stand by. Clear.

131
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,151
I`m checkin` out.

132
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:31,711
Thanks for the kiss of life.

133
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:38,191
Security breach on level three.
All personnel defensive, code red.

134
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:40,631
Apprehend and detain with force.

135
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:42,871
Security breach on level three.

136
00:25:42,992 --> 00:25:44,951
All personnel defensive, code red.

137
00:25:45,071 --> 00:25:47,191
Apprehend and detain with force.

138
00:25:47,311 --> 00:25:49,071
Security breach on level three.

139
00:25:49,191 --> 00:25:51,151
All personnel defensive, code red.

140
00:26:40,353 --> 00:26:42,153
My usual suite, please.

141
00:26:43,793 --> 00:26:46,113
Do you have a credit card?

142
00:26:46,234 --> 00:26:47,994
Or even any luggage, sir?

143
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:51,954
Mr Bond, so good to see you.
It`s been a long time.

144
00:26:52,074 --> 00:26:53,114
Mr Chang.

145
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:55,154
Open the Presidential Suite.

146
00:26:55,754 --> 00:26:57,994
Could you send up my tailor
and some food?

147
00:26:58,314 --> 00:27:01,954
The lobster`s good,
with quails` eggs and sliced seaweed.

148
00:27:02,114 --> 00:27:06,395
- And if there`s any left, a `61 Bollinger.
- Of course.

149
00:27:06,915 --> 00:27:07,635
Do it quickly.

150
00:27:09,474 --> 00:27:11,875
Been busy, have we, Mr Bond?

151
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:14,555
Just surviving, Mr Chang.

152
00:27:14,635 --> 00:27:16,195
Just surviving.

153
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:38,476
I am Peaceful Fountains of Desire.
The masseuse.

154
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:41,516
I come with compliments of the manager.

155
00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:44,156
I`m sure you do. Come in.

156
00:27:49,956 --> 00:27:52,916
On the bed, please. Face down.

157
00:27:55,077 --> 00:27:57,036
Yes, of course.

158
00:28:00,117 --> 00:28:02,676
I`m not that kind of masseuse.

159
00:28:05,556 --> 00:28:07,717
I`m not that kind of customer.

160
00:28:13,237 --> 00:28:18,077
You think I haven`t always known
you`re Chinese Intelligence, Chang?

161
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:23,117
- Hong Kong`s our turf now, Bond.
- Don`t worry. I`m not here to take it back.

162
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:29,318
Put your hands down.

163
00:28:29,437 --> 00:28:31,317
What the hell do you want?

164
00:28:31,438 --> 00:28:33,878
Just to help you settle a score.

165
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,118
Zao killed three of your men.

166
00:28:37,518 --> 00:28:40,998
You get me into North Korea,
I`ll take care of him for you.

167
00:28:41,718 --> 00:28:43,878
What`s in it for you?

168
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:47,038
Chance to get even.

169
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,318
Zao has information I need.

170
00:28:55,638 --> 00:28:57,759
- I`ll have to ask Beijing.
- Do it.

171
00:28:57,879 --> 00:29:01,839
Now get out. Unless you
really want to give me a massage.

172
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,839
Ah, Mr Bond.

173
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,120
A little ``thank you`` from us.

174
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,360
- Cuba?
- It seems Mr Zao`s lost himself in Havana.

175
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,040
If you find him, say goodbye from us.

176
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:41,440
With pleasure.

177
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,441
HAVANA

178
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:15,922
- »Sí?
- I`m here to pick up Delectados.

179
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:20,402
Delectados? We haven`t
made Delectados in 30 years.

180
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:24,042
I`m from Universal Exports.
Check with your boss.

181
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:34,323
Follow me.

182
00:30:34,642 --> 00:30:36,683
Your passport, señor.

183
00:31:10,764 --> 00:31:13,804
I`d come to think the Delectados
would never be smoked.

184
00:31:15,084 --> 00:31:18,684
They are particularly hazardous
for one`s health, Mr...

185
00:31:18,804 --> 00:31:20,604
Bond.

186
00:31:20,724 --> 00:31:23,124
Mr Bond.

187
00:31:23,244 --> 00:31:27,285
- D`you know why?
- It`s the addition of the Volado tobacco.

188
00:31:27,405 --> 00:31:29,485
Slow-burning.

189
00:31:29,605 --> 00:31:31,964
It never goes out.

190
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,925
- Just like a sleeper.
- Sorry for the rude awakening.

191
00:31:41,045 --> 00:31:42,524
I love my country, Mr Bond.

192
00:31:42,645 --> 00:31:46,845
I`d never ask you to betray your people.
I`m after a North Korean.

193
00:31:46,925 --> 00:31:49,005
- A tourist?
- A terrorist.

194
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:52,005
One man`s terrorist
is another man`s freedom fighter.

195
00:31:52,445 --> 00:31:55,646
Zao has no interest
in other people`s freedom.

196
00:32:02,325 --> 00:32:05,286
I still have some friends in high places.

197
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:12,806
Favours called in.
Some dollars spread about.

198
00:32:12,886 --> 00:32:18,167
We find your friend is here,
on an island in Los Organos.

199
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:22,567
There is a strange clinic
run by Doctor Alvarez.

200
00:32:22,646 --> 00:32:25,047
He leads the field in gene therapy.

201
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:30,006
Increasing the life expectancy
of our beloved leaders.

202
00:32:30,126 --> 00:32:33,327
And, of course, the richest Westerners.

203
00:32:34,087 --> 00:32:37,527
We may have lost our freedom
in the revolution, but...

204
00:32:37,887 --> 00:32:40,127
we have a health system second to none.

205
00:32:40,247 --> 00:32:43,127
You don`t seem to have done
badly out of the revolution.

206
00:32:43,207 --> 00:32:45,927
We all have our ways of getting by.

207
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:50,207
You`d be surprised how many
government officials come to me

208
00:32:50,327 --> 00:32:52,647
for reminders of the decadent times.

209
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:53,928
Ah, yeah, well.

210
00:32:55,048 --> 00:32:57,047
- Mind if I borrow these?
- Please.

211
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:02,608
My sources tell me this Zao is dangerous.
I wish I could give you more help.

212
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:07,168
I could use a fast car.

213
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:48,090
Mojito, por favor.

214
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:51,690
Mr Krug, your admittance papers
for the Alvarez Clinic tomorrow.

215
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,570
About bloody time, Fidel.

216
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,810
Now round up some more girls
and take them to room 42.

217
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:02,291
Unless you want to be
known as Fidel Castrato.

218
00:35:04,573 --> 00:35:06,532
Magnificent view.

219
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,253
It is, isn`t it?

220
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:14,293
Too bad it`s lost on everybody else.

221
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:16,372
Mojito?

222
00:35:17,693 --> 00:35:19,653
You should try it.

223
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:24,973
Giacinta Johnson.
My friends call me Jinx.

224
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:27,574
My friends call me James Bond.

225
00:35:27,973 --> 00:35:29,934
Jinx, you say.

226
00:35:30,054 --> 00:35:32,613
Born on Friday the 13th.

227
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:34,974
Do you believe in bad luck?

228
00:35:35,094 --> 00:35:38,534
Let`s just say
my relationships don`t seem to last.

229
00:35:38,654 --> 00:35:40,694
I know the feeling.

230
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:46,614
Predators usually appear at sunset.

231
00:35:47,934 --> 00:35:51,094
- And why is that?
- It`s when their prey comes out to drink.

232
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:55,814
Too strong for you?

233
00:35:57,014 --> 00:35:59,894
I could learn to like it, if I had the time.

234
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:02,334
How much time have you got?

235
00:36:03,014 --> 00:36:07,055
- Until dawn. What about you?
- Oh, I`m just here for the birds.

236
00:36:09,215 --> 00:36:11,415
Ornithologist.

237
00:36:11,535 --> 00:36:13,495
Ornithologist, huh?

238
00:36:14,135 --> 00:36:16,495
Wow. Now there`s a mouthful.

239
00:36:19,016 --> 00:36:22,375
So you`re gonna be busy tonight
with the owls then, huh?

240
00:36:22,495 --> 00:36:26,895
No owls in Los Organos.
Nothing to see till the morning.

241
00:36:28,695 --> 00:36:30,656
Not out there, anyway.

242
00:36:33,376 --> 00:36:36,256
So what do predators do...

243
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:39,016
when the sun goes down?

244
00:36:40,577 --> 00:36:43,216
They feast...

245
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:45,696
like there`s no tomorrow.

246
00:37:31,338 --> 00:37:33,898
Are you always this frisky?

247
00:37:34,778 --> 00:37:37,418
I`ve been missing the touch
of a good woman.

248
00:37:40,138 --> 00:37:42,098
Who says I`m good?

249
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:55,061
What the hell do you want?
I don`t need a wheelchair.

250
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:55,941
No?

251
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:57,901
You do now.

252
00:38:58,621 --> 00:39:00,261
- »Buenos días!
- »Hola!

253
00:39:13,622 --> 00:39:15,182
Seòor.

254
00:39:16,102 --> 00:39:18,222
- OK.
- Gracias.

255
00:39:18,902 --> 00:39:23,663
Isla Los Organos

256
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:02,544
»Buenos días!

257
00:40:57,346 --> 00:41:00,666
So you are to have
DNA replacement therapy.

258
00:41:00,786 --> 00:41:02,746
Let me explain the two phases.

259
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:07,306
First, we kill off your bone marrow,
wipe the DNA slate clean.

260
00:41:07,626 --> 00:41:11,907
Phase two: introduction of new DNA
harvested from healthy donors -

261
00:41:12,027 --> 00:41:15,987
orphans, runaways,
people that won`t be missed.

262
00:41:17,026 --> 00:41:20,347
I like to think of myself as an artist.

263
00:41:20,467 --> 00:41:22,427
And this is when I create.

264
00:41:25,947 --> 00:41:27,987
Thank you.

265
00:41:28,107 --> 00:41:30,387
It is a painful process, I`m afraid.

266
00:41:30,507 --> 00:41:34,227
But... all great art is.

267
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:37,948
I`ll certainly enjoy working on you.

268
00:41:40,227 --> 00:41:44,427
Of course, you know,
most artists are only truly appreciated

269
00:41:44,548 --> 00:41:46,507
after they`re dead.

270
00:42:04,868 --> 00:42:08,229
My father was a sergeant.
We lived in Hampshire.

271
00:42:08,348 --> 00:42:11,068
I have fond memories of the countryside.

272
00:43:10,911 --> 00:43:12,711
Oh, good.

273
00:43:12,831 --> 00:43:14,551
Got your attention.

274
00:43:17,552 --> 00:43:20,272
Who`s bankrolling
your makeover, Zao? Hm?

275
00:43:22,271 --> 00:43:24,431
Same person who
set me up in North Korea?

276
00:44:20,113 --> 00:44:22,114
James? What`s goin` on?

277
00:44:22,554 --> 00:44:25,753
Jinx, you`ve gotta get out of here now!
Move! Move!

278
00:44:55,755 --> 00:44:57,315
Vamos! Vamos!

279
00:45:09,435 --> 00:45:10,355
Vamos!

280
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,276
Move it! Move it! Let`s go!

281
00:46:39,959 --> 00:46:45,399
See, my friend, the chemical composition
shows this is from Sierra Leone.

282
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:48,399
- Conflict diamonds.
- Yeah.

283
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,239
There`s some kind of marking here.

284
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:54,319
- ``GG.``
- Let me see.

285
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,639
Oh, yes.

286
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,960
From the Graves Corporation in Iceland.

287
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,639
That`s his laser signature.

288
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,760
A man called Gustav Graves discovered
diamonds there a year or so ago.

289
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,840
Yet they`re identical to conflict diamonds.

290
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,960
What an amazing coincidence.

291
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:27,601
How can he escape from a British warship
in Hong Kong right under your nose?

292
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:31,081
- Interesting station, Moneypenny?
- All I got was a storm warning.

293
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,481
You were supposed to throw away
the key, not leave the door wide open.

294
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:38,121
Are you implying I had a hand
in his escape, Mr Falco?

295
00:47:38,241 --> 00:47:41,081
Well, Bond got away real fast, didn`t he?

296
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:43,081
It is what he`s trained to do.

297
00:47:43,201 --> 00:47:47,482
Your boy`s been busy in his training. He
showed up in Cuba and torches a clinic.

298
00:47:47,602 --> 00:47:52,361
Listen, you put your house in order,
or we`re gonna do it for you.

299
00:48:06,602 --> 00:48:08,562
Your drink, sir.

300
00:48:09,443 --> 00:48:11,602
Lucky I asked for it shaken.

301
00:48:36,483 --> 00:48:38,244
- When`s he coming?
- I don`t know.

302
00:48:41,323 --> 00:48:44,563
- Looks like your man won`t make it.
- Actually, he`s right on time.

303
00:49:18,965 --> 00:49:22,525
- Wonderful day to become a knight.
- Will you use your title, Mr Graves?

304
00:49:22,645 --> 00:49:26,045
I`m proud of my adopted nation,
but I`d never stand on ceremony.

305
00:49:26,165 --> 00:49:29,045
After that entrance,
you can`t be surprised to be called

306
00:49:29,165 --> 00:49:33,285
- a self-publicising, adrenaline junkie.
- I prefer the term ``adventurer``.

307
00:49:33,405 --> 00:49:36,926
There are rumours about the Icarus
space programme. What`s the secret?

308
00:49:37,046 --> 00:49:40,446
It`s not a secret, it`s a surprise.
You`ll soon be enlightened.

309
00:49:40,565 --> 00:49:43,806
You seem to work 24-seven.
Is it true you don`t need sleep?

310
00:49:43,926 --> 00:49:46,686
You only get one shot at life.
Why waste it on sleep?

311
00:49:46,806 --> 00:49:51,046
Are you trying out for the British Olympic
fencing team? You`ve trained furiously.

312
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:54,686
I never get furious. As they say in fencing,
``What`s the point?``

313
00:49:55,446 --> 00:49:59,886
Thank you very much. We don`t want
to keep Her Majesty waiting any longer.

314
00:50:00,006 --> 00:50:02,086
- Mr Graves?
- Mr Graves?

315
00:50:15,607 --> 00:50:17,167
Hit.

316
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,247
That`s a hit.

317
00:50:29,967 --> 00:50:31,808
Verity?

318
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:33,808
James Bond.

319
00:50:34,248 --> 00:50:36,247
Your lesson.

320
00:50:39,448 --> 00:50:41,488
I see you handle your weapon well.

321
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:44,728
I have been known to keep my tip up.

322
00:50:47,648 --> 00:50:50,488
Do you mind? I think I`ve come undone.

323
00:50:52,448 --> 00:50:54,208
Why not?

324
00:50:55,048 --> 00:50:57,208
Hit. Positions.

325
00:50:57,329 --> 00:50:59,168
Play.

326
00:51:00,049 --> 00:51:02,209
Feast your eyes on the club`s finest blade.

327
00:51:04,049 --> 00:51:08,089
- Gustav Graves?
- His publicist, Miranda Frost.

328
00:51:10,329 --> 00:51:11,809
Et lá!

329
00:51:12,209 --> 00:51:14,009
My protégée.

330
00:51:14,129 --> 00:51:16,130
Gorgeous, isn`t she?

331
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,009
She took the gold at Sydney.

332
00:51:18,129 --> 00:51:20,969
- By default, if I remember.
- Default?

333
00:51:21,089 --> 00:51:24,170
The one who beat her OD`d on steroids.

334
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,049
Miranda deserved that gold.

335
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:28,570
Now she`s teaching Graves
how to win one.

336
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,650
He only plays for cash.

337
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:34,730
He`s won so much,
nobody else wants to fight him.

338
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:41,091
You wanna meet him?

339
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:43,691
Absolutely.

340
00:51:44,931 --> 00:51:46,811
Lead on.

341
00:51:49,411 --> 00:51:51,491
- Gustav.
- Verity.

342
00:51:52,851 --> 00:51:54,771
- And Mr...?
- Bond.

343
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:58,250
James Bond.

344
00:51:59,131 --> 00:52:01,171
Have we met before?

345
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:03,251
Oh, I think I`d remember.

346
00:52:04,611 --> 00:52:07,571
Of course you would. My mistake.

347
00:52:07,692 --> 00:52:11,252
- Are you a gambling man, Mr Bond?
- If the stakes are right.

348
00:52:12,092 --> 00:52:14,891
L1 ,000 a point too much for you?

349
00:52:17,572 --> 00:52:19,531
Care to place a bet, Verity?

350
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,012
No, thanks.

351
00:52:24,132 --> 00:52:26,091
I don`t like cockfights.

352
00:52:28,172 --> 00:52:30,212
Shall we?

353
00:52:30,332 --> 00:52:32,292
Excuse me.

354
00:52:34,612 --> 00:52:36,572
Best of three hits?

355
00:52:37,932 --> 00:52:39,452
Positions.

356
00:52:39,572 --> 00:52:41,332
Ready. Play.

357
00:52:41,652 --> 00:52:43,613
En garde.

358
00:52:52,053 --> 00:52:54,453
Hit. Positions.

359
00:52:55,813 --> 00:52:57,053
Play.

360
00:53:01,533 --> 00:53:02,853
Et lá!

361
00:53:02,974 --> 00:53:04,453
Hit.

362
00:53:04,573 --> 00:53:06,333
2-0.

363
00:53:06,453 --> 00:53:09,493
- D`you want to continue?
- D`you want to up the wager?

364
00:53:10,734 --> 00:53:13,214
How much can you afford?

365
00:53:13,334 --> 00:53:15,294
Let`s play for this.

366
00:53:16,814 --> 00:53:19,173
I picked it up in Cuba.

367
00:53:19,294 --> 00:53:21,454
I believe it`s one of yours.

368
00:53:23,494 --> 00:53:25,054
My, my.

369
00:53:25,174 --> 00:53:28,615
They do get around.
But, then, diamonds are for everyone.

370
00:53:32,414 --> 00:53:35,134
Brilliant specimen. Completely flawless.

371
00:53:35,414 --> 00:53:38,974
And chemically identical
to African conflict diamonds.

372
00:53:39,894 --> 00:53:43,054
Then you`re about to lose
something very precious.

373
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:47,215
Positions.

374
00:53:48,215 --> 00:53:50,415
Ready. Play.

375
00:53:50,535 --> 00:53:52,496
En garde.

376
00:53:58,135 --> 00:54:00,215
Oh, dear.

377
00:54:01,496 --> 00:54:03,296
You want to continue?

378
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:06,216
Of course I want to bloody continue!

379
00:54:06,336 --> 00:54:10,215
But since we`re upping the wager,
let`s up the weapons, shall we?

380
00:54:10,335 --> 00:54:11,896
Yeah.

381
00:54:12,535 --> 00:54:16,896
Let`s do this the old-fashioned way.
First blood drawn from the torso.

382
00:54:29,696 --> 00:54:31,457
Steady on!

383
00:56:25,981 --> 00:56:28,181
That is enough!

384
00:56:31,701 --> 00:56:33,942
It`s just a little sport, Miranda.

385
00:56:39,621 --> 00:56:42,181
It seems you beat me, Mr Bond.

386
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:47,742
Settle downstairs, shall we?

387
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:49,622
Miranda.

388
00:57:02,022 --> 00:57:04,582
You`re a rare challenge, Mr Bond.

389
00:57:04,663 --> 00:57:09,942
I`m putting on a scientific demonstration
in Iceland at the weekend. Icarus?

390
00:57:10,742 --> 00:57:13,182
Join us. Miranda, make the arrangements.

391
00:57:13,303 --> 00:57:16,223
Once I`ve smoothed
things over with the club.

392
00:57:16,342 --> 00:57:18,743
What would I do without you?

393
00:57:22,303 --> 00:57:24,863
Can I expect the pleasure of you
in Iceland?

394
00:57:24,943 --> 00:57:27,583
You`ll never have that pleasure, Mr Bond.

395
00:57:29,303 --> 00:57:33,064
Excuse me, Commander Bond.
Someone left this for you.

396
00:57:34,623 --> 00:57:37,063
Place needed redecorating anyway.

397
00:58:22,026 --> 00:58:24,025
I heard of this place.

398
00:58:26,506 --> 00:58:29,065
Never thought I`d find myself here.

399
00:58:29,146 --> 00:58:32,266
Some things are best kept underground.

400
00:58:32,826 --> 00:58:36,546
An abandoned station
for abandoned agents.

401
00:58:38,626 --> 00:58:41,906
- Your calling card.
- So what have you got on Graves?

402
00:58:43,266 --> 00:58:45,627
You burn me.

403
00:58:45,706 --> 00:58:48,706
- And now you want my help.
- What did you expect, an apology?

404
00:58:48,786 --> 00:58:52,627
Oh, I know you`ll do
whatever it takes to get the job done.

405
00:58:52,707 --> 00:58:55,507
- Just like you.
- The difference is I won`t compromise.

406
00:58:55,946 --> 00:59:00,186
Well, I don`t have the luxury
of seeing things as black and white.

407
00:59:00,267 --> 00:59:03,466
- While you were gone the world changed.
- Not for me.

408
00:59:07,227 --> 00:59:10,868
You`re suspicious of Graves,
or I wouldn`t be here right now.

409
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:15,508
- So, what do you have?
- Nothing beyond the official biography.

410
00:59:15,707 --> 00:59:19,667
Orphan working in an Argentinian
diamond mine learns engineering.

411
00:59:19,748 --> 00:59:23,787
Makes a huge find in Iceland
and gives half of it to charity.

412
00:59:23,868 --> 00:59:26,468
From nothing to everything
in no time at all.

413
00:59:28,828 --> 00:59:32,988
- And his demonstration this weekend?
- Probably just another publicity stunt.

414
00:59:33,068 --> 00:59:35,788
Now, tell me what you know
about this Cuban clinic.

415
00:59:36,548 --> 00:59:42,148
Gene therapy. New identities
courtesy of DNA transplants.

416
00:59:42,228 --> 00:59:44,429
So-called ``beauty parlour``.

417
00:59:44,508 --> 00:59:48,389
We`d heard rumours of such a place.
I didn`t think it really existed.

418
00:59:48,468 --> 00:59:50,069
It doesn`t any more.

419
00:59:50,749 --> 00:59:52,988
Zao got away.

420
00:59:53,069 --> 00:59:55,349
But he left these behind.

421
00:59:57,229 --> 00:59:59,309
All from Gustav Graves`s mine.

422
01:00:01,429 --> 01:00:05,590
I think it`s a front for laundering
African conflict diamonds.

423
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:09,950
We need to tread carefully.
Graves is politically connected.

424
01:00:11,429 --> 01:00:15,990
- Lucky I`m on the outside, then.
- It seems you`ve become useful again.

425
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:22,910
Then maybe it`s time
you let me get on with my job.

426
01:01:39,273 --> 01:01:41,072
Forgive my mentioning it, 007,

427
01:01:41,153 --> 01:01:45,353
but a perfect marksman isn`t really
supposed to shoot his own boss.

428
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,953
Check the replay.

429
01:01:50,033 --> 01:01:54,113
You`ll find he`s dead
and she`s only got a flesh wound.

430
01:01:54,193 --> 01:01:57,754
There`s always an excuse,
isn`t there, Double-O Zero?

431
01:01:58,074 --> 01:02:00,873
Give me the old firing range any day,
Quartermaster.

432
01:02:00,954 --> 01:02:03,993
Yes, but it`s called the future,
so get used to it.

433
01:02:04,754 --> 01:02:08,154
So, this is where they keep
the old relics then, eh?

434
01:02:08,834 --> 01:02:13,154
I`ll have you know this is where our most
cutting-edge technology is developed.

435
01:02:13,234 --> 01:02:15,874
- Point taken.
- Must you touch everything?

436
01:02:15,954 --> 01:02:17,955
Does this still work?

437
01:02:23,275 --> 01:02:27,074
- Now, look...
- So where is this cutting-edge stuff?

438
01:02:27,155 --> 01:02:29,155
I`m trying to get to it.

439
01:02:31,475 --> 01:02:33,474
Weapon, please.

440
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:43,555
One pane unbreakable glass,
one standard-issue ring finger.

441
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:46,076
Twist so, et voilá.

442
01:02:47,436 --> 01:02:50,836
Ultra high-frequency,
single-digit, sonic agitator unit.

443
01:02:50,915 --> 01:02:52,516
You`re cleverer than you look.

444
01:02:52,595 --> 01:02:55,956
Better than looking cleverer than you are.
Follow me, please.

445
01:02:56,036 --> 01:03:00,556
- Now, a new watch. Your 20th, I believe.
- How time flies.

446
01:03:00,635 --> 01:03:05,756
Yes, well, 007, why don`t you establish
a record by actually returning this one?

447
01:03:05,836 --> 01:03:07,836
Your new transportation.

448
01:03:17,997 --> 01:03:19,797
You`ve been down here too long.

449
01:03:19,876 --> 01:03:25,437
- The ultimate in British engineering.
- You must be joking.

450
01:03:25,517 --> 01:03:30,077
As I learnt from my predecessor, Bond,
I never joke about my work.

451
01:03:30,157 --> 01:03:34,357
Aston Martin call it the Vanquish.
We call it the Vanish.

452
01:03:39,317 --> 01:03:41,638
- Oh, very good.
- Adaptive camouflage.

453
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:45,278
Tiny cameras on all sides
project the image they see

454
01:03:45,357 --> 01:03:48,318
onto a light-emitting polymer skin
on the opposite side.

455
01:03:48,397 --> 01:03:51,038
To the casual eye,
it`s as good as invisible.

456
01:03:51,117 --> 01:03:53,918
Plus the usual refinements:
ejector seat, torpedoes,

457
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:57,958
target-seeking shotguns
to shoot down mobile objects.

458
01:03:58,038 --> 01:04:02,838
Acquaint yourself with the manual. Should
be able to shoot through it in two hours.

459
01:04:08,359 --> 01:04:10,679
Just took a few seconds, Q.

460
01:04:11,799 --> 01:04:14,158
Wish I could make you vanish.

461
01:04:17,279 --> 01:04:18,919
Come in.

462
01:04:22,279 --> 01:04:26,319
Before you leave
on your mission for Iceland,

463
01:04:26,399 --> 01:04:29,199
tell me what you know of James Bond.

464
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:32,640
He`s a double-O.
And a wild one, as I discovered today.

465
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:37,879
He`ll light fuses on any explosive situation
and be a danger to himself and others.

466
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,399
Kill first, ask questions later.

467
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,199
He`s a blunt instrument whose primary
method is to provoke and confront.

468
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:48,600
A man nobody can get close to.
A womaniser.

469
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:52,000
Well, you`re going to be seeing
a lot more of him in Iceland.

470
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:57,680
With great respect,
a man like him could blow my cover.

471
01:04:57,761 --> 01:05:02,801
Miss Frost, you volunteered for this, but
in three months you`ve turned up nothing.

472
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,161
Graves seems to be clean.

473
01:05:05,241 --> 01:05:09,881
Well, Bond thinks differently, so I`m going
to let him do what you so ably described -

474
01:05:09,961 --> 01:05:12,201
mix things up a little with Mr Graves.

475
01:05:12,561 --> 01:05:15,600
And with you there,
things won`t be able to get out of hand.

476
01:05:16,881 --> 01:05:21,321
In your three years in Cryptology, you`ve
kept business and pleasure separate.

477
01:05:21,401 --> 01:05:24,961
You haven`t fraternised
with any of your fellow agents,

478
01:05:25,042 --> 01:05:27,481
despite several advances.

479
01:05:27,561 --> 01:05:31,841
I think it would be foolish to get involved
with someone within the community.

480
01:05:32,201 --> 01:05:34,121
Especially James Bond.

481
01:06:08,603 --> 01:06:10,603
I`m Mr Kil.

482
01:06:10,683 --> 01:06:13,003
Well, there`s a name to die for.

483
01:06:39,484 --> 01:06:43,284
324 miles an hour.
That`s a new personal best, boss.

484
01:06:43,365 --> 01:06:46,044
Thruster two cut out again.
Get it fixed, will you?

485
01:06:46,724 --> 01:06:49,405
Glad you could make it, Mr Bond.
How did you like my run?

486
01:06:49,484 --> 01:06:51,644
You looked on the edge of losing control.

487
01:06:51,725 --> 01:06:56,085
It`s only by being on the edge that we
know who we really are. Under the skin.

488
01:06:56,164 --> 01:07:01,285
Take your Donald Campbell -
1967, the Bluebird, water speed record.

489
01:07:03,165 --> 01:07:07,205
- Campbell died on his return run.
- Yeah, but he died chasing a dream.

490
01:07:07,285 --> 01:07:10,725
- Isn`t that the way to go?
- I`d rather not go at all.

491
01:07:10,806 --> 01:07:14,886
- You don`t chase dreams, you live them.
- One of the virtues of never sleeping.

492
01:07:14,965 --> 01:07:20,086
I have to live my dreams. Besides,
plenty of time to sleep when you`re dead.

493
01:07:22,166 --> 01:07:23,686
Mr Bond.

494
01:07:23,766 --> 01:07:26,726
- Ah, Miss Frost.
- I`ll show you your room.

495
01:07:26,806 --> 01:07:29,566
A palace of ice.
You must feel right at home.

496
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:32,326
This place was built
for tonight`s demonstration.

497
01:07:32,406 --> 01:07:35,806
The human element necessitates
a precise balance of heat and cold.

498
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:38,647
Built on a lake?
I hope Graves got things right.

499
01:07:38,726 --> 01:07:41,886
- What`s that property I noticed next door?
- The diamond mine.

500
01:07:41,966 --> 01:07:43,847
And Gustav`s quarters.

501
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,487
Thank you.

502
01:08:00,608 --> 01:08:02,567
This is you.

503
01:08:02,648 --> 01:08:04,448
Wonderful.

504
01:08:04,527 --> 01:08:06,888
Would you like to show me more?

505
01:08:19,848 --> 01:08:23,848
Vodka martini.
Plenty of ice, if you can spare it.

506
01:08:28,208 --> 01:08:30,209
Mojito?

507
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,128
James.

508
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:37,248
Here for the penguins this time,
or for the view again?

509
01:08:37,329 --> 01:08:39,769
Now I`m only interested
in endangered species.

510
01:08:39,848 --> 01:08:44,248
- Oh, well, does that include me?
- Depends on what you`re up to this time.

511
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:48,889
So I left you in an explosive situation.
You`re a big boy who can handle himself.

512
01:08:49,689 --> 01:08:54,569
- No wonder your relationships don`t last.
- I`m a girl who hates to get tied down.

513
01:09:36,811 --> 01:09:38,091
You look terrible.

514
01:09:39,171 --> 01:09:42,051
You aren`t looking too good yourself.

515
01:09:47,491 --> 01:09:49,932
You are still feeling the side effects?

516
01:09:50,651 --> 01:09:53,212
The insomnia is permanent for me.

517
01:09:53,291 --> 01:09:56,131
An hour on the Dream Machine
keeps me sane.

518
01:09:57,091 --> 01:09:59,612
- What happened to you?
- Bond.

519
01:09:59,971 --> 01:10:05,132
He knows nothing. I`ve been this close
to him and he still didn`t know who I was.

520
01:10:08,012 --> 01:10:10,852
- You saw my father after your exchange?
- Yes.

521
01:10:11,892 --> 01:10:14,492
General Moon still mourns your death.

522
01:10:14,572 --> 01:10:16,572
My death.

523
01:10:18,652 --> 01:10:20,452
Mr Bond.

524
01:10:20,812 --> 01:10:24,853
- And Miss...?
- Swift. Space and Technology magazine.

525
01:10:25,133 --> 01:10:29,533
Really? I take it Mr Bond`s been
explaining his big-bang theory.

526
01:10:29,613 --> 01:10:32,533
Oh, yeah, I think I got the thrust of it.

527
01:10:32,613 --> 01:10:34,013
I see.

528
01:10:35,693 --> 01:10:40,293
Well, the demonstration`s about to begin
in five minutes. So shall we?

529
01:10:40,373 --> 01:10:42,373
Shall we?

530
01:10:44,973 --> 01:10:47,094
Not Jinx any more?

531
01:10:47,173 --> 01:10:49,574
Oh, I`ll always be a jinx to you.

532
01:10:58,774 --> 01:11:04,654
As you know, I try to give the planet
something in return for what it`s given me.

533
01:11:04,734 --> 01:11:08,494
Those little shards of heaven
known as diamonds.

534
01:11:08,614 --> 01:11:13,094
Now, diamonds aren`t just expensive
stones. They are the stuff of dreams.

535
01:11:13,175 --> 01:11:15,454
And the means to make dreams real.

536
01:11:33,616 --> 01:11:39,335
Imagine being able to bring light and
warmth to the darkest parts of the world.

537
01:11:39,415 --> 01:11:43,176
Imagine being able to grow crops
the year round, bringing an end to hunger.

538
01:11:43,255 --> 01:11:46,376
Imagine a second sun,

539
01:11:46,456 --> 01:11:49,856
shining like a diamond in the sky.

540
01:11:52,136 --> 01:11:53,416
Let there be light.

541
01:12:01,096 --> 01:12:03,497
I give you Icarus!

542
01:12:09,896 --> 01:12:14,256
Icarus is unique. Its miraculous
silver skin will inhale the sun`s light

543
01:12:14,337 --> 01:12:17,377
and breathe it gently
upon the earth`s surface.

544
01:12:18,017 --> 01:12:22,457
You have no idea how much Icarus
is about to change your world.

545
01:12:33,378 --> 01:12:37,577
And now let us brighten this night
with our inner radiance.

546
01:14:09,701 --> 01:14:13,181
- Vlad, show me the modifications.
- Yeah.

547
01:14:13,621 --> 01:14:17,222
Here is the self-defence mechanism
you asked me to build in.

548
01:14:17,301 --> 01:14:19,061
50,000 volts?

549
01:14:19,142 --> 01:14:20,942
100.

550
01:14:22,781 --> 01:14:25,101
Armed.

551
01:14:25,182 --> 01:14:28,622
- And very dangerous.
- Oh, very.

552
01:15:22,824 --> 01:15:24,664
M warned me this would happen.

553
01:15:24,744 --> 01:15:27,984
Ah. That`s why you tried so hard
not to be interested in me.

554
01:15:28,064 --> 01:15:31,185
Oh, God, you`re even worse
than your file says.

555
01:15:33,464 --> 01:15:35,464
They don`t look too convinced.

556
01:15:35,544 --> 01:15:37,864
Come on. Put your back into it, eh?

557
01:15:43,225 --> 01:15:45,064
I know all about you, 007.

558
01:15:45,145 --> 01:15:48,305
Sex for dinner, death for breakfast.
It won`t work with me.

559
01:15:48,385 --> 01:15:50,185
- No?
- No.

560
01:15:58,545 --> 01:16:02,105
- You`re getting good at this.
- Oh, stop it. Are we still being watched?

561
01:16:02,186 --> 01:16:05,705
- Oh, they left ages ago.
- Oh, God, you`re impossible.

562
01:16:05,785 --> 01:16:07,346
Come on, let`s get out of here.

563
01:16:35,187 --> 01:16:38,586
You better stay here tonight.
Keep up the charade of being lovers.

564
01:16:38,667 --> 01:16:39,867
All right.

565
01:16:40,187 --> 01:16:45,027
I admire your restraint. You were here
a full two hours before anything blew up.

566
01:16:46,667 --> 01:16:49,587
The way you`re going,
you`ll get us both killed.

567
01:16:52,987 --> 01:16:56,108
James, tell me what really happened
in North Korea.

568
01:16:56,187 --> 01:16:58,787
I was betrayed. That was all.

569
01:17:03,947 --> 01:17:06,147
Occupational hazard.

570
01:17:12,308 --> 01:17:15,508
This is crazy. You`re a double-O.

571
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:17,828
It`s only a number.

572
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:55,590
James.

573
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:58,870
Be careful.

574
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:05,350
Go back to your room.
I`ll come back for you.

575
01:18:35,871 --> 01:18:37,752
Why do you want to kill me?

576
01:18:38,272 --> 01:18:41,312
I thought it was the humane thing to do.

577
01:18:46,752 --> 01:18:48,751
Who sent you?

578
01:18:50,152 --> 01:18:53,832
Your mama. And she told me to tell you
she`s really disappointed in you.

579
01:18:56,192 --> 01:18:58,472
I`ll let you in on a little secret.

580
01:18:59,153 --> 01:19:00,872
This mine is fake.

581
01:19:00,952 --> 01:19:02,912
But the lasers...

582
01:19:04,392 --> 01:19:06,393
are real.

583
01:19:26,073 --> 01:19:28,273
She won`t talk.

584
01:19:28,713 --> 01:19:30,513
Let`s make it permanent.

585
01:19:30,593 --> 01:19:32,594
I`ll use the laser.

586
01:19:32,673 --> 01:19:34,674
Don`t leave a mess.

587
01:20:48,916 --> 01:20:52,476
- Jinx.
- James! James! No, no, turn it off! Off!

588
01:20:52,796 --> 01:20:54,436
Off!

589
01:21:19,158 --> 01:21:21,597
James, I could use a little help here!

590
01:21:28,397 --> 01:21:30,398
Switch if off!

591
01:21:30,477 --> 01:21:32,838
Or I`m gonna be half the girl I used to be!

592
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:15,599
So, the girl who hates
to be tied down, huh?

593
01:22:15,719 --> 01:22:19,039
- Are you gonna get me off this thing?
- What are you? CIA?

594
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,960
NSA. Hello? We`re on the same side.

595
01:22:22,039 --> 01:22:25,120
- Doesn`t mean we`re after the same thing.
- Sure it does.

596
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:30,560
World peace, unconditional love, and
your little friend with the expensive acne.

597
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:33,040
- Zao?
- Yeah, Zao.

598
01:22:33,401 --> 01:22:36,561
He`s back there with some
weird psychedelic light mask.

599
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,840
Probably brought it from the Cuban clinic.

600
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,760
He couldn`t have brought it.

601
01:22:42,841 --> 01:22:44,641
It was already here.

602
01:22:47,801 --> 01:22:50,521
It belongs to another Korean.

603
01:22:50,601 --> 01:22:52,401
His boss.

604
01:22:55,561 --> 01:22:59,521
- Kil can give us a hand to get out of here.
- I got a better idea.

605
01:23:09,882 --> 01:23:11,922
- I`m going to get backup.
- Wait.

606
01:23:12,001 --> 01:23:15,001
Go to Miranda first. She`s MI6.
Warn her to get out.

607
01:23:15,082 --> 01:23:16,882
And what are you gonna do?

608
01:23:16,962 --> 01:23:18,961
Unfinished business.

609
01:23:31,322 --> 01:23:33,922
So you live to die another day...

610
01:23:35,403 --> 01:23:37,443
Colonel.

611
01:23:37,522 --> 01:23:42,243
At last. I was beginning
to think you`d never guess.

612
01:23:42,323 --> 01:23:44,243
Was it painful?

613
01:23:44,843 --> 01:23:47,683
- The gene therapy?
- You couldn`t possibly imagine.

614
01:23:47,763 --> 01:23:50,483
Oh, good. I`m glad to hear that.

615
01:23:50,923 --> 01:23:53,403
Oh, but there have been compensations.

616
01:23:53,483 --> 01:23:56,443
Like watching you
flail around in your ignorance.

617
01:23:56,524 --> 01:24:00,443
Granting you life day by day
just to see if you`d get wise. It`s been fun.

618
01:24:01,564 --> 01:24:04,523
Well, the fun is about
to come to a dead end.

619
01:24:05,644 --> 01:24:08,324
We only met briefly, you and I.

620
01:24:08,404 --> 01:24:10,924
But you left a lasting impression.

621
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:14,884
When your intervention forced me
to present the world with a new face,

622
01:24:14,964 --> 01:24:18,444
I chose to model
the disgusting Gustav Graves on you.

623
01:24:20,324 --> 01:24:22,845
Oh, just in the details.

624
01:24:22,924 --> 01:24:26,685
That unjustifiable swagger.

625
01:24:26,764 --> 01:24:31,605
Your crass quips - a defence mechanism
concealing such inadequacy.

626
01:24:31,684 --> 01:24:34,325
My defence mechanism is right here.

627
01:24:38,445 --> 01:24:42,245
So... Miss Frost isn`t all she seems.

628
01:24:42,325 --> 01:24:44,126
Looks can be deceptive.

629
01:24:47,565 --> 01:24:49,726
Yes.

630
01:24:49,805 --> 01:24:53,006
By the way, did you find out
who betrayed you in North Korea?

631
01:24:53,085 --> 01:24:54,646
Only a matter of time.

632
01:24:54,725 --> 01:24:58,606
You never thought of looking
inside your own organisation?

633
01:25:02,446 --> 01:25:05,086
She was right under your nose.

634
01:25:09,086 --> 01:25:11,926
It was so good of you
to bring your gun to bed with us.

635
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:14,806
Yes. Occupational hazard.

636
01:25:17,967 --> 01:25:20,686
You see, I have a gift.

637
01:25:20,766 --> 01:25:23,526
An instinct for sensing
people`s weaknesses.

638
01:25:23,607 --> 01:25:27,366
Yours is women. Hers and mine
is winning whatever the cost.

639
01:25:27,447 --> 01:25:31,367
So when I arranged for that fatal
overdose for the true victor at Sydney,

640
01:25:31,447 --> 01:25:34,887
I won myself my very own MI6 agent,

641
01:25:35,607 --> 01:25:38,087
using everything at my disposal -

642
01:25:38,168 --> 01:25:41,448
her brains, her talent,

643
01:25:41,527 --> 01:25:43,127
even her sex.

644
01:25:43,687 --> 01:25:45,607
The coldest weapon of all.

645
01:25:48,647 --> 01:25:50,448
Hello?

646
01:25:51,247 --> 01:25:53,048
Miranda?

647
01:25:59,368 --> 01:26:03,928
- There will be others after me, you know.
- You mean your American friend Jinx.

648
01:26:06,888 --> 01:26:09,449
Soon to be the victim of a tragedy.

649
01:26:09,528 --> 01:26:12,009
An ice palace can be
such a treacherous place.

650
01:26:12,088 --> 01:26:14,448
Hand over the toys.

651
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:16,768
Oh, yeah.

652
01:26:20,048 --> 01:26:23,289
You know, I`ve missed
your sparkling personality.

653
01:26:24,449 --> 01:26:26,249
How`s that for a punch line?

654
01:26:26,329 --> 01:26:28,129
Kill him.

655
01:26:28,729 --> 01:26:32,969
I enjoyed last night, James.
But it really is death for breakfast.

656
01:26:48,610 --> 01:26:49,810
Kill him quietly.

657
01:27:22,451 --> 01:27:24,411
Kill him! Now!

658
01:27:32,731 --> 01:27:35,532
- He got away.
- No matter.

659
01:27:35,652 --> 01:27:38,292
The pleasure of the kill is in the chase.

660
01:27:38,412 --> 01:27:39,972
Bring me the generals.

661
01:27:51,012 --> 01:27:54,692
Gentlemen,
I promised you a demonstration.

662
01:27:55,092 --> 01:27:58,053
Now you will see the true power of Icarus.

663
01:28:06,293 --> 01:28:08,813
The Western spy runs, but he cannot hide.

664
01:28:18,453 --> 01:28:23,813
Icarus will lock onto the heat signature
and concentrate the sun`s power.

665
01:28:41,374 --> 01:28:43,734
Hey, boss, he beat your time.

666
01:29:47,416 --> 01:29:49,137
Time to draw the line.

667
01:30:18,658 --> 01:30:21,378
Global warming is a terrible thing.

668
01:31:18,740 --> 01:31:21,700
Yeah, nice moves. Just like Bond.

669
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:24,900
He was pretty vigorous last night as well.

670
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:28,061
He did you?
I didn`t know he was that desperate.

671
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:32,540
He won`t come back for you. He just died
running, trying to save his own skin.

672
01:31:33,021 --> 01:31:34,300
Yeah.

673
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:39,301
That`s pretty good tailoring.
I hope it doesn`t shrink when it gets wet.

674
01:32:09,422 --> 01:32:11,702
Soon we will be victorious.

675
01:32:21,622 --> 01:32:24,423
We`ve got one hour to wrap this up.
Let`s move.

676
01:33:22,465 --> 01:33:24,984
Come on, Jinx. Where are you?

677
01:33:32,505 --> 01:33:34,305
All units report. Now!

678
01:33:56,426 --> 01:33:58,786
Warning. Adaptive camouflage failure.

679
01:35:47,590 --> 01:35:50,310
Time to give the American her bath.

680
01:38:01,835 --> 01:38:04,115
Adaptive camouflage restored.

681
01:38:50,477 --> 01:38:55,157
Vlad, does the word ``ergonomics``
mean anything to you? Man? Machine?

682
01:38:56,517 --> 01:38:59,638
This is still a suitcase.

683
01:39:00,438 --> 01:39:02,557
Finish it, will you?

684
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:09,601
Come on. It`s warm in here. Come on.

685
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:12,440
The cold kept you alive, huh?

686
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:15,120
Must have kept you alive. Come on.

687
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:18,800
That`s it.

688
01:40:24,361 --> 01:40:26,321
What took you so long?

689
01:40:59,922 --> 01:41:01,882
Agent Johnson.

690
01:41:02,482 --> 01:41:04,362
- James.
- Charles.

691
01:41:05,082 --> 01:41:07,722
OK. Bring us up to speed on this.

692
01:41:07,842 --> 01:41:10,722
Another division`s been mobilised
north of the DMZ.

693
01:41:10,802 --> 01:41:14,682
- That`s 80,000 troops and counting.
- And another million in reserve.

694
01:41:14,762 --> 01:41:16,883
Moon`s father won`t let it turn into a war.

695
01:41:16,962 --> 01:41:20,083
Moon`s under arrest.
Hardliners staged a coup last night.

696
01:41:20,163 --> 01:41:23,763
The fact remains you deliberately
misled me by implicating Bond.

697
01:41:23,883 --> 01:41:28,683
- If you`d told us of your agent in Cuba...
- She`d be dead, betrayed by your mole.

698
01:41:28,803 --> 01:41:32,164
We wouldn`t have had a mole
if you`d told us Miss Frost and Moon

699
01:41:32,243 --> 01:41:35,363
were on the Harvard
fencing team together.

700
01:41:35,683 --> 01:41:38,803
Knowing who to trust
is everything in this business.

701
01:41:38,884 --> 01:41:41,164
Well, well. James Bond.

702
01:41:41,283 --> 01:41:44,724
- Just in time for the fireworks.
- Let`s get down to business.

703
01:41:45,083 --> 01:41:46,644
We`re at DEFCON 2.

704
01:41:46,764 --> 01:41:50,244
And if the North goes South,
they`re gonna go south big time.

705
01:41:50,524 --> 01:41:53,644
You don`t just stroll through
the world`s biggest minefield.

706
01:41:53,764 --> 01:41:57,405
You need some kind of an edge. Icarus.

707
01:41:57,524 --> 01:42:01,564
We`re taking care of that
with an ASAT launch in one hour.

708
01:42:01,684 --> 01:42:04,964
- Where`s Graves?
- In the middle of a North Korean air base.

709
01:42:05,085 --> 01:42:07,444
Right where we can`t touch him.

710
01:42:10,724 --> 01:42:14,485
You can`t... but I can.

711
01:42:14,605 --> 01:42:19,605
Look, we`re here in case things escalate,
not to make sure that they do.

712
01:42:19,725 --> 01:42:23,325
No incursions into the North.
The president gave me a direct order.

713
01:42:23,725 --> 01:42:26,005
And when did that ever stop you?

714
01:42:26,125 --> 01:42:28,926
You make your own decision.
I`m sending in 007.

715
01:42:30,885 --> 01:42:34,406
You think I`d leave this
in the hands of the British?

716
01:42:34,526 --> 01:42:36,486
You go with him.

717
01:42:37,765 --> 01:42:39,726
Approaching drop zone!

718
01:42:44,206 --> 01:42:46,166
OK, let`s go!

719
01:42:56,446 --> 01:42:59,807
- They`ve entered North Korean airspace.
- Relax, Robinson.

720
01:42:59,927 --> 01:43:04,887
If our radar can`t see those switchblades,
the North Koreans sure as hell can`t.

721
01:43:25,527 --> 01:43:28,328
Hey, boss, they launched against Icarus.

722
01:43:29,288 --> 01:43:31,247
Leave it on automatic.

723
01:43:40,928 --> 01:43:45,448
I hope nobody here is superstitious. That
is one big mirror we`re about to break.

724
01:43:54,249 --> 01:43:57,849
My God.
Mobilise the South Korean troops.

725
01:43:57,969 --> 01:43:59,769
And get me the president, now!

726
01:43:59,849 --> 01:44:01,809
Still no news of Bond?

727
01:44:15,090 --> 01:44:17,050
Vehicles.

728
01:44:18,049 --> 01:44:20,010
Some big shots.

729
01:44:23,770 --> 01:44:26,050
It`s him.

730
01:44:27,410 --> 01:44:30,610
- 300 metres.
- Windage: one and a half.

731
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:40,611
We`ve gotta get on that plane.

732
01:45:18,612 --> 01:45:22,172
You. Have my father brought down.

733
01:46:09,494 --> 01:46:10,174
Father.

734
01:46:11,414 --> 01:46:14,613
I regret our meeting
had to be like this.

735
01:46:14,774 --> 01:46:18,454
You can`t tell it`s me?

736
01:46:19,774 --> 01:46:21,534
I don`t know you.

737
01:46:23,294 --> 01:46:26,174
You`ve always found it difficult
to accept me.

738
01:46:26,775 --> 01:46:31,615
That made my exile easier to bear,
but I never forgot what you taught me.

739
01:46:32,535 --> 01:46:36,854
``In war the victorious strategist
only seeks battle...

740
01:46:36,974 --> 01:46:39,935
..after the victory has been won.``

741
01:46:41,375 --> 01:46:45,655
You see, Father,
I remember my Art of War.

742
01:46:45,775 --> 01:46:48,735
And this is what guarantees that victory.

743
01:47:30,097 --> 01:47:32,057
My son...

744
01:47:33,616 --> 01:47:35,897
What have you done to yourself?

745
01:47:37,577 --> 01:47:39,737
Come, Father.

746
01:47:40,417 --> 01:47:42,897
Watch the rising of your son.

747
01:48:10,698 --> 01:48:15,098
The second that hits the 38th parallel,
we`ll hit them with everything we got.

748
01:48:15,218 --> 01:48:17,179
That may not be enough.

749
01:48:31,819 --> 01:48:33,699
Do you see, Father?

750
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:38,740
Icarus is clearing the minefield,
creating a highway for our troops.

751
01:48:39,659 --> 01:48:43,739
If the Americans don`t run,
Icarus will destroy them.

752
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:09,181
Japan is a bug waiting to be squashed.

753
01:49:10,421 --> 01:49:12,781
And the West will shake with fear.

754
01:49:17,501 --> 01:49:22,661
- America will send nuclear warheads.
- Icarus will swat them from the sky.

755
01:50:04,942 --> 01:50:06,702
You will destroy us.

756
01:50:12,903 --> 01:50:14,743
You would kill your own son?

757
01:50:14,863 --> 01:50:17,663
The son I knew died long ago.

758
01:50:34,784 --> 01:50:38,704
Father, you disappoint me.

759
01:51:29,506 --> 01:51:31,426
Caution. Caution.

760
01:51:31,546 --> 01:51:34,386
Manual. Manual.

761
01:51:39,986 --> 01:51:42,226
Up! Up!

762
01:51:42,626 --> 01:51:44,586
Come on.

763
01:52:02,747 --> 01:52:04,788
OK, guys.

764
01:52:04,907 --> 01:52:06,467
OK.

765
01:52:09,947 --> 01:52:11,427
I got it.

766
01:52:11,547 --> 01:52:14,108
My, my. You get around.

767
01:52:14,228 --> 01:52:16,428
Let`s see your gun.

768
01:52:16,548 --> 01:52:18,508
Uh-uh. Left hand.

769
01:52:20,348 --> 01:52:21,988
That`s it.

770
01:52:22,907 --> 01:52:25,548
That`s it. Now drop it.

771
01:52:27,548 --> 01:52:29,748
Looks like your friends have bailed.

772
01:52:37,989 --> 01:52:40,269
Put it on autopilot.

773
01:52:40,388 --> 01:52:42,108
Come on.

774
01:52:42,229 --> 01:52:44,588
That`s it. Good girl.

775
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:09,149
Drowning you didn`t seem to work. I`ll
have to try something more to the point.

776
01:53:12,869 --> 01:53:14,670
1 ,000 metres and closing.

777
01:55:13,994 --> 01:55:16,555
I can read your every move.

778
01:55:20,434 --> 01:55:22,514
Read this.

779
01:55:22,634 --> 01:55:24,595
Bitch!

780
01:55:58,716 --> 01:56:01,596
Oh, look! Parachutes for the both of us.

781
01:56:04,476 --> 01:56:06,636
Whoops. Not any more.

782
01:56:12,396 --> 01:56:16,236
You see, Mr Bond,
you can`t kill my dreams.

783
01:56:18,957 --> 01:56:21,077
But my dreams can kill you.

784
01:56:22,517 --> 01:56:24,477
Time to face destiny.

785
01:56:40,198 --> 01:56:42,078
Time to face gravity.

786
01:57:21,159 --> 01:57:23,959
I think I broke her heart.

787
01:57:26,759 --> 01:57:29,359
Looks like we`re going down together.

788
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:31,399
Not yet.

789
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:37,640
- Get the back open!
- OK!

790
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:55,641
Come on!

791
01:59:01,283 --> 01:59:05,283
- Come on. Come on.
- I told you I was a jinx.

792
01:59:05,683 --> 01:59:09,683
I should have warned you.
My relationships don`t last either.

793
01:59:15,163 --> 01:59:17,924
- At least we`re gonna die rich.
- Huh?

794
01:59:21,283 --> 01:59:23,524
Come on. Come on, come on.

795
01:59:23,603 --> 01:59:26,203
Come on. Come on.

796
01:59:45,205 --> 01:59:47,084
Now...

797
01:59:47,165 --> 01:59:50,364
you said something about
going down together?

798
02:00:28,646 --> 02:00:30,486
James.

799
02:00:30,566 --> 02:00:32,447
Moneypenny.

800
02:01:14,968 --> 02:01:16,968
Oh, James.

801
02:01:27,128 --> 02:01:29,048
Moneypenny?

802
02:01:30,609 --> 02:01:33,969
I was... just testing it out.

803
02:01:36,049 --> 02:01:37,888
It`s rather hard, isn`t it?

804
02:01:37,969 --> 02:01:40,449
Yes. Very.

805
02:02:14,570 --> 02:02:17,610
Wait. Don`t pull it out.
I`m not finished with it yet.

806
02:02:17,690 --> 02:02:20,771
See? It`s a perfect fit.

807
02:02:22,451 --> 02:02:25,571
- Leave it in.
- Well, it`s gotta come out sooner or later.

808
02:02:25,650 --> 02:02:29,731
No, leave it in, please.
A few more minutes.

809
02:02:32,210 --> 02:02:34,211
We really have to get these back.

810
02:02:35,770 --> 02:02:38,211
Still the good guys, huh?

811
02:02:42,131 --> 02:02:44,132
I`m still not quite sure...

812
02:02:45,131 --> 02:02:46,771
how good you are.

813
02:02:49,211 --> 02:02:51,652
I am so good.

814
02:02:53,651 --> 02:02:55,852
Especially when you`re bad.

815
02:06:55,941 --> 02:06:57,821
I need to lay down.
