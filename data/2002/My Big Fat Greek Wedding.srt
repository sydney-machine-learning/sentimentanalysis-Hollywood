1
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:54,931
You`d better get married soon.

2
00:01:55,136 --> 00:01:59,072
You`re starting to look old.

3
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:02,940
My dad`s been saying that to me
since I was fifteen.

4
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:06,136
Because nice Greek girls are
supposed to do three things in life:

5
00:02:06,348 --> 00:02:10,580
marry Greek boys, make Greek
babies and feed everyone...

6
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:12,912
until the day we die.

7
00:03:04,406 --> 00:03:07,466
When I was growing up,
I knew I was different.

8
00:03:08,043 --> 00:03:11,069
The other girls were
blonde and delicate.

9
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:14,271
And I was a swarthy 6 year-old
with sideburns.

10
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:17,315
I so badly wanted to be
like the popular girls...

11
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,714
all sitting together, talking...

12
00:03:19,921 --> 00:03:22,549
eating their
Wonderbread sandwiches...

13
00:03:22,757 --> 00:03:26,215
-What`s that?
-lt`s ``moussaka``.

14
00:03:26,594 --> 00:03:28,687
``Moose-caca``?

15
00:03:30,632 --> 00:03:35,194
The pretty girls went to Brownie`s.
I had to go to Greek school.

16
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,245
At Greek school, I learned
valuable lessons like:

17
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:52,045
``If Nick has one goat, and Maria
has nine, how soon will they marry?

18
00:03:55,623 --> 00:03:59,992
My mom was always cooking foods
filled with warmth and wisdom.

19
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:03,392
And never forgetting that side dish
of steaming hot guilt.

20
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:06,567
Niko, don`t play with the food!

21
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:10,200
-At your age, we didn`t have food.
-Ma?

22
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:13,966
-What?
-Why do l have to go to Greek school?

23
00:04:14,175 --> 00:04:18,771
When you get married, don`t you
want to write your mother-in-law?

24
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,413
Niko, come on, eat!

25
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:23,846
We lived in a normal middle-class
Chicago neighborhood...

26
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:26,077
of tasteful modest homes.

27
00:04:26,287 --> 00:04:29,347
Our house, however,
was modeled after the Parthenon...

28
00:04:29,557 --> 00:04:33,823
complete with Corinthian columns
and guarded by statues of the gods.

29
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:37,589
In case the neighbors had
any doubts about our heritage...

30
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:41,200
they could just check out our
subtle tribute to the Greek flag.

31
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:44,368
My dad believed
in only two things:

32
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:47,700
that Greeks should educate
non-Greeks about being Greek...

33
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:51,106
and that any illment,
from psoriasis to poison-ivy...

34
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:53,743
could be cured with Windex.

35
00:04:54,983 --> 00:04:59,613
Six years later: I was 1 2, Athena,
my older perfect sister, was 1 5...

36
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:03,154
and my brother Nick was 1 1. Every
morning, my dad would lecture us...

37
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:08,921
on the history of our people,
the great civilization: the Greeks.

38
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,328
Now, name three things
the Greeks did first.

39
00:05:14,636 --> 00:05:19,369
-Astronomy, philosophy and democracy.
-Bravo! Very good.

40
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:22,710
Now, give me a word...

41
00:05:23,144 --> 00:05:29,344
any word, and l`ll show you how
the root of that word is Greek.

42
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:35,256
Okay?
How about arachnophobia?

43
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:40,057
``Arachna``, that comes from
the Greek word for ``spider``...

44
00:05:40,395 --> 00:05:46,891
and ``phobia`` means ``fear``,
so fear of spider. There you go.

45
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:51,370
Okay, Mr. Portokalos.
How about the word ``kimono``?

46
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:56,340
Kimono? Kimono, kimono...

47
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:03,877
Of course! ``Kimono`` comes
from the Greek word ``cheimonas``...

48
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:05,882
that means ``winter``.

49
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:11,684
So, what do you wear in the winter
time to stay warm? A robe.

50
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:15,329
You see? Robe, kimono.
There you go.

51
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:25,062
-Bye-bye.
-Good-bye, Mr. Portokalos.

52
00:06:30,178 --> 00:06:31,167
Toula!

53
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:36,009
You should be proud to be Greek.

54
00:06:40,822 --> 00:06:45,919
Years went by, and dad brought his
mother from Greece to live with us...

55
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:48,254
because we weren`t weird enough.

56
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:53,357
Listen up, ugly Turk.

57
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:57,971
You`re not kidnapping me.

58
00:07:02,877 --> 00:07:05,846
-Get her! Where is she going?
-Mama, please.

59
00:07:06,047 --> 00:07:08,106
The Greeks and the Turks
are friends now!

60
00:07:08,316 --> 00:07:11,911
We told my grandma that war was
over, but she still slept with a knife.

61
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:14,752
Mama!

62
00:07:15,556 --> 00:07:17,717
Stop hitting me!

63
00:07:18,726 --> 00:07:22,457
Niko, be careful!
She has a very mean punch!

64
00:07:31,673 --> 00:07:34,039
-Mama!
-Please, come back!

65
00:07:34,642 --> 00:07:39,011
Nice Greek girls who don`t find a
husband work in the family restaurant.

66
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:42,876
So, here I am, day after day,
year after year...

67
00:07:43,084 --> 00:07:46,019
thirty, and way passed
my expiration date.

68
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:49,516
lt`s freezing!

69
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:54,252
Fortoula! You closed last night,
you`re opening this morning.

70
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:56,391
l have no life.

71
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:59,725
Ah, Toula, you talk
to me sometime, uh?

72
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:02,801
Ma, you`re going to make me
swallow my tongue.

73
00:08:03,838 --> 00:08:07,171
Toula! ls Nikki here?

74
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:10,272
-What`s up there?
-No, my Nikki.

75
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:12,503
She was supposed to come over
to curl my hair.

76
00:08:12,714 --> 00:08:15,706
Nick, did you check the meat
before you signed for it?

77
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:18,215
-Dad checked it.
-lt`d better be fresh.

78
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:22,253
My brother has 2 jobs: to cook
and to marry a Greek virgin.

79
00:08:22,457 --> 00:08:25,620
Voula, have something to eat
before you go to work.

80
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:30,091
If nagging was an Olympic sport, my
aunt Voula would have a gold medal.

81
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:33,233
Taki. You couldn`t wait for me?

82
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:38,869
-Sorry. Sorry.
-``Sorry``. Don`t ``sorry`` me.

83
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:42,270
Look at this. Rash.
Somebody gave me the ``mati``.

84
00:08:42,477 --> 00:08:44,411
-Put some Windex on.
-Please, please!

85
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:48,381
Voula, this works!

86
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:53,077
Last night, my toe was
as big as my face.

87
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:56,890
So why didn`t you wait for me?

88
00:08:57,392 --> 00:09:01,328
Because... He wants to talk.

89
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:08,868
Anyway, l tell her l will
send her to Greece...

90
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,233
...to find somebody.
-Say, is she not too old?

91
00:09:17,945 --> 00:09:20,505
-She`s okay.
-ln Greece...

92
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:24,682
...don`t tell anyone how old she is.
-She won`t go!

93
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:30,050
-She won`t go?
-lt`s like she doesn`t want to marry.

94
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:34,219
Come on, we`re going
to see uncle Nick.

95
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:38,490
My sister married young and became
a Greek baby breeding machine.

96
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:42,133
Look at those!

97
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:49,409
Quick coffee. l`ll drop the boys off
at hockey and then go to the Jewel.

98
00:09:49,644 --> 00:09:51,771
Pantyhose are on for 99 cents.

99
00:09:51,979 --> 00:09:55,346
The priest is coming to bless the new
house, so l have to make ``diples``.

100
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,542
Can you believe it? l`m out
of honey. Put that back for me.

101
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:01,379
-Angelo...
-Shut up, Nikki!

102
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:04,956
My cousins have two volumes:
loud and louder.

103
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:08,191
-Thanks, Toula.
-We`re not that late.

104
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:10,728
Oh, Angelo, my boy!

105
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:14,594
Nikki, how come you didn`t come
to curl my hair this morning?

106
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:17,737
Ma, l had to drop Dimos at work.

107
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:19,597
And now l gotta go
to the travel agency...

108
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:23,299
because some jag-off and his
big-ass girlfriend are too busy.

109
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:27,743
l open the dry-cleaners every day.
lt`s about time she did something.

110
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:30,941
-You know who`s at the dry-cleaners?
-You`re always at the beauty salon...

111
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:33,211
-My husband.
-...doing your nails and your hair.

112
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:38,085
Don`t you talk about my hair. You and
your big-ass girlfriend do nothing!

113
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:40,522
Did somebody sit on your hair?
lt looks a little flat there.

114
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:42,992
Angelo, bite me!

115
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:46,491
-Be a lady!
-Ma...

116
00:10:46,834 --> 00:10:51,430
-Angelo.
-Come on, boys! Let`s go!

117
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:54,902
-Athena! When did you come?
-Hi, ma. Bye, ma.

118
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:58,442
-Are you going?
-l`ll get you pantyhose at Jewel.

119
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,546
No queen-size.
They make me look fat.

120
00:11:07,255 --> 00:11:08,745
Who put the menus there?

121
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:14,685
Toula, what`s this?

122
00:11:15,963 --> 00:11:19,228
-What is this?
-l don`t know.

123
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:21,900
Mama! Mama!

124
00:11:22,103 --> 00:11:26,233
-Don`t forget l need ``diples``...
-And the ``pastichio``. You told me.

125
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,773
-Athena, go! My God! Go!
-Okay.

126
00:11:29,977 --> 00:11:32,468
-Alright, we`re going to go.
-Bye!

127
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,308
-l want to drive.
-You drive me crazy. Let`s go!

128
00:11:35,683 --> 00:11:38,652
Watch your step.
Don`t run!

129
00:11:45,826 --> 00:11:49,421
-To me, she looks okay.
-Okay? What okay? No okay.

130
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,997
She`s not okay. Athena`s married
with three children!

131
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:56,231
And l`ll get married, pops.
l promise.

132
00:11:58,206 --> 00:12:01,334
You have plenty of time, Niko.

133
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:06,269
And you`ll always have Toula
to run the restaurant.

134
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,449
lt`s true.
Toula will never leave you.

135
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:00,764
I wish I had a different life.

136
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:04,498
I wish I was braver
and prettier...

137
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:08,539
or just happy.
But it`s useless to dream...

138
00:13:08,743 --> 00:13:11,303
because nothing ever changes.

139
00:13:28,162 --> 00:13:31,029
-Hey, what`s going on?
-Hi, man. How are you?

140
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,924
-Good, and you?
-l`m good.

141
00:13:35,303 --> 00:13:38,033
-Cool place.
-Yeah, it`s adorable.

142
00:13:39,507 --> 00:13:42,135
You missed a hell of a party
the other night.

143
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:47,742
Look at that. That could`ve been
you with that arm around her.

144
00:13:48,316 --> 00:13:50,375
You set me up with her already.

145
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,947
-Nancy?
-Henson`s picnic.

146
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,753
No, that was Pamela.
This is Nancy.

147
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:05,296
They look the same.

148
00:14:07,435 --> 00:14:10,871
Well, maybe. So, do you
want me to set you up?

149
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,670
They`re all the same, Mike.

150
00:14:25,953 --> 00:14:27,853
-Hi.
-Hi.

151
00:14:29,857 --> 00:14:35,454
Sorry. My brain just stopped.
Have you ever had one of those days?

152
00:14:35,996 --> 00:14:41,229
Going along and then stops. Here
l am, your private Greek statue.

153
00:14:46,907 --> 00:14:49,671
-Can l get some more coffee, please?
-Sure.

154
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,337
Thank you.

155
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:05,822
All right, let`s go.

156
00:15:06,026 --> 00:15:08,722
-What do you mean? l just got here.
-l know. l`ve got a class, though.

157
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:12,490
-l loved this spice. What is that?
-Like l care. Come on.

158
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,566
l`m giving a pop-quiz and
l can`t wait to hear the groans.

159
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:21,234
Man, you`re tough. l`m giving a test
on Hamlet, but l gave fair warning.

160
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,883
Hi.

161
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,858
Keep the change.

162
00:15:51,572 --> 00:15:55,838
-Do you like this? For the new menu?
-Where did you get that?

163
00:15:57,278 --> 00:15:59,269
l drew it, dad.

164
00:16:14,662 --> 00:16:16,391
Dad.

165
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:19,294
Dad.

166
00:16:20,801 --> 00:16:23,429
Dad, l`ve been going
through our inventory...

167
00:16:23,637 --> 00:16:27,368
and l`ve noticed that we`ve been
doing a lot of unnecessary ordering.

168
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:31,108
So l`ve been thinking.
Maybe we should update our system.

169
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:34,041
Like, we could get a computer.

170
00:16:34,982 --> 00:16:37,917
l don`t know if you remember,
but l got all A`s in Computers.

171
00:16:38,118 --> 00:16:42,646
But there`s a lot of new stuff
to learn now, so, if you want...

172
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:46,293
l could go to college
and take a few courses.

173
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,563
Why...

174
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,334
Why do you want to leave me?

175
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:59,404
l`m not leaving you. Don`t you want
me to do something with my life?

176
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:03,634
Yes! Get married!
Make babies!

177
00:17:03,844 --> 00:17:06,142
You look so... old!

178
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:23,254
Toula.

179
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:26,055
Toula. Come on, Toula.

180
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:33,098
l know what you want. You have,
how do you say? You have a spirit.

181
00:17:34,508 --> 00:17:38,103
You want to see things,
you want to learn.

182
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:40,936
l know. You`re from my side.

183
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:46,817
Come on, don`t you worry.
l`m going to talk to him.

184
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:52,616
Dad is stubborn. What he says goes.
``The man is the head of the house``.

185
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:56,353
Let me tell you something, Toula:
the man is the head...

186
00:17:56,564 --> 00:18:03,231
but the woman is the neck. She can
turn the head anywhere she wants.

187
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,242
My baby.
Don`t cry, don`t cry, come on.

188
00:18:10,878 --> 00:18:14,143
What`s wrong with Toula going
to school downtown?

189
00:18:14,348 --> 00:18:16,646
-There is drugs downtown.
-What are you saying?

190
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,114
That Toula will get
involved with drugs?

191
00:18:19,587 --> 00:18:22,750
No, but somebody will say to her:

192
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:27,189
``Take this bag down to the
bus depot``, and she`ll do it!

193
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:31,490
-She`s not stupid! She`s smart!
-l know she`s smart.

194
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:35,135
So what for she needs more school?
She`s smart enough for a girl.

195
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,095
You think you`re
smarter than me, uh?

196
00:18:39,306 --> 00:18:43,800
-No, l mean... You know...
-What? What do you mean?

197
00:18:44,011 --> 00:18:49,074
l run the restaurant, l cook,
l clean, l wash for you...

198
00:18:49,283 --> 00:18:54,949
and l raised three kids, and
l teach Sunday school, you know?

199
00:18:55,155 --> 00:18:59,057
lt`s lucky for me
l have you to tie my shoes!

200
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,592
Maria...

201
00:20:19,506 --> 00:20:21,770
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

202
00:21:10,224 --> 00:21:13,352
-What are you two talking about?
-About my butt.

203
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,793
-l don`t like it, but Taki likes it.
-Listen, l`m not going to pretend...

204
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:23,629
this is something l`ve always wanted
to do. l`m just saying it`s different.

205
00:21:24,438 --> 00:21:26,599
l`ve been learning about computers.

206
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:30,766
There`s this course. lt`s a seminar
all about computers and tourism...

207
00:21:30,978 --> 00:21:34,744
with all the latest applications
and programs. l could apply it here.

208
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:38,349
Your business would double, triple.
You could be with ``theo`` more.

209
00:21:38,552 --> 00:21:41,680
You could take a vacation. l could
book it for you. Would you hire me?

210
00:21:45,392 --> 00:21:47,257
Of course.

211
00:21:47,661 --> 00:21:51,597
Oh, my God!
Okay! Okay!

212
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:54,427
l`m sorry. Oh, my God, ma!

213
00:21:57,371 --> 00:22:01,967
We must let Costa think this was
his idea. That he came up with it.

214
00:22:02,176 --> 00:22:04,007
-Ma, he`s going to figure it out.
-Don`t you worry.

215
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:06,509
-l know what to do.
-No, you talk, talk, talk.

216
00:22:06,713 --> 00:22:08,203
-Do you want my help?
-Yes, l want your help.

217
00:22:08,415 --> 00:22:11,316
-But don`t tell me what to say.
-Perfect.

218
00:22:15,489 --> 00:22:19,550
So, Voula, how is business?

219
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:24,154
Oh, war to me!
Business is bad.

220
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:28,032
What`s the matter? What happened?
You need money?

221
00:22:28,235 --> 00:22:33,798
No, no. What she means is that,
with two businesses, she suffers.

222
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:39,741
-She suffers?
-She is at the travel agency alone...

223
00:22:39,947 --> 00:22:43,849
because everybody else is working
at the big dry-cleaning store.

224
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:47,746
That`s right. l make Taki go
to the dry-cleaners store...

225
00:22:47,955 --> 00:22:51,948
and now l have no time with him.

226
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,892
So send Angelo or Nikki
to the travel agency...

227
00:22:57,097 --> 00:22:59,827
and you`ll be with Taki
at the dry-cleaner.

228
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:04,237
-That would be good.
-That would be no good.

229
00:23:04,438 --> 00:23:06,963
-No good?
-No good, no good.

230
00:23:07,174 --> 00:23:12,271
Because neither Angelo or Nikki
know how to use the computer.

231
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:14,508
That`s why that won`t work.

232
00:23:16,884 --> 00:23:19,148
Computer?

233
00:23:22,189 --> 00:23:24,657
l have your answer!

234
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:32,155
Toula will go to the travel agency,
and Nikki comes here to work for us.

235
00:23:33,901 --> 00:23:35,630
l can`t believe that.

236
00:23:36,436 --> 00:23:40,270
-Wonderful. Wonderful!
-You see? A man.

237
00:23:40,507 --> 00:23:45,444
-Yes! You`re so smart!
-Costa, Costa!

238
00:23:50,484 --> 00:23:54,511
Mrs. Cristakis? Thanks for holding.
Your request is confirmed.

239
00:23:54,721 --> 00:23:59,215
lt`s now P&R`ed. Okay, hold
again, please. Hi, British Airways?

240
00:23:59,426 --> 00:24:04,693
l`ll need a hard tick on that one.
Alfa, Bravo, Fox-Trot, Charlie.

241
00:24:04,898 --> 00:24:08,732
Copy that. Hi, Mrs. Cristakis?
Your tickets are now in the mail...

242
00:24:08,936 --> 00:24:11,996
under Doreen Cristakis.
Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.

243
00:24:33,093 --> 00:24:34,890
What`s the time? The time?

244
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,424
And now, the last contestant
on ``The Price Is Right``!

245
00:25:10,597 --> 00:25:12,656
l`ll get it.

246
00:25:18,872 --> 00:25:20,533
Did you lose this?

247
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:23,175
Bloodthirsty Turks.

248
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:29,075
Mrs. White!
You find my mama again?

249
00:25:29,516 --> 00:25:32,883
You know, she comes from Greece.

250
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:35,247
-The country l come from too.
-For God`s sake, l know!

251
00:25:35,455 --> 00:25:38,891
Listen, keep your mother
off my lawn...

252
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:41,890
out of my basement
and away from my roof!

253
00:25:42,295 --> 00:25:46,026
Mrs. White, come on.
Give me a word, any word...

254
00:25:46,233 --> 00:25:49,999
and l`ll show you that
the root of that word...

255
00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:53,370
is Greek.

256
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:57,632
Look, everybody.
Look who`s back again!

257
00:25:57,978 --> 00:26:03,143
-Hi, Yaya.
-Sit down, Yaya. Very good.

258
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,513
Toula, there are
two kinds of people:

259
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,019
Greeks and everybody else
who wish they were Greek.

260
00:26:10,323 --> 00:26:12,951
Okay. Yes, we know!

261
00:26:14,694 --> 00:26:16,355
What`s the matter with her?

262
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:57,398
Mount Olympus Travel Agency,
may l help you?

263
00:26:57,604 --> 00:26:59,572
Sure, that`s what we do.

264
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:06,143
-What are you doing? Wait!
-Absolutely. Right.

265
00:27:06,346 --> 00:27:07,938
Sorry, lady.

266
00:27:13,854 --> 00:27:18,348
Sure. You can book it now.
l can reserve the seat for you.

267
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:20,321
Be with you in a second.
That would be no problem.

268
00:27:20,527 --> 00:27:23,052
All right, call me back when you are
ready to book. Thank you. Bye-bye.

269
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:28,325
Hi.

270
00:27:30,203 --> 00:27:31,500
Hi.

271
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,901
Did you want to see
some brochures?

272
00:27:43,116 --> 00:27:44,481
Found them.

273
00:27:50,123 --> 00:27:52,216
-Like this?
-No.

274
00:27:54,327 --> 00:27:57,922
And then `` woosh`` .
God, l thought you`d fainted.

275
00:27:59,499 --> 00:28:01,729
Oh, okay. Yeah.

276
00:28:01,935 --> 00:28:07,032
l was swept off my feet by your
very cool opening line: ``Hi``.

277
00:28:12,646 --> 00:28:14,614
So, Toula...

278
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:17,645
lan.

279
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:20,012
lan Miller.

280
00:28:20,854 --> 00:28:25,382
-Toula... Porkypakos?
-Portokalos.

281
00:28:26,993 --> 00:28:29,427
-Okay. Toula.
-All right then.

282
00:28:35,535 --> 00:28:38,504
So was that a biker fight
or a nose job?

283
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:44,840
-Yeah.
-No, really.

284
00:28:45,245 --> 00:28:47,475
You don`t want to know.

285
00:28:48,048 --> 00:28:52,917
Well, if l had survived an old lady
ass-kicking, l`d brag about it.

286
00:28:56,856 --> 00:28:59,381
Jesus! Ouch!

287
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,358
-You want to have dinner with me?
-Yeah.

288
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,463
Actually, l wasn`t in education first.
l was pre-law.

289
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:15,403
My dad is a lawyer,
my grandfather is a lawyer...

290
00:29:15,842 --> 00:29:19,744
This wasn`t for me, so...
l picked a new major.

291
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:23,382
-The parents weren`t too pleased.
-Yeah.

292
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:27,219
l think...

293
00:29:28,421 --> 00:29:31,288
l think it takes a pretty
strong person to do that.

294
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:37,427
You know everything about me then:
l`m a strong vegetarian teacher...

295
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:43,368
over at Lincoln Park, and
l don`t know anything about you...

296
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,031
except you`re Greek.

297
00:29:48,975 --> 00:29:51,500
Would you like to go
have Greek food?

298
00:29:52,245 --> 00:29:55,339
-Oh, that`s okay.
-Listen, l know this great place.

299
00:29:55,548 --> 00:29:58,312
You probably know it.
Zorba`s something.

300
00:29:59,085 --> 00:30:02,248
Anyway, l`d like to take you there,
if you`d like to go.

301
00:30:02,922 --> 00:30:06,358
-l don`t want to go there.
-What do you mean? Why not?

302
00:30:11,731 --> 00:30:14,928
That place,
Dancing Zorba`s...

303
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:16,962
Dancing Zorba`s.

304
00:30:18,405 --> 00:30:20,839
My family owns that restaurant.

305
00:30:23,243 --> 00:30:25,074
Really?

306
00:30:32,852 --> 00:30:35,082
l remember you.

307
00:30:37,123 --> 00:30:38,988
You`re that waitress.

308
00:30:41,127 --> 00:30:44,460
Sitting hostess, actually.

309
00:30:45,231 --> 00:30:50,396
-l remember you.
-l was kind of going through a phase...

310
00:30:50,603 --> 00:30:54,903
up till now, and...

311
00:30:57,177 --> 00:30:59,270
l was frump girl.

312
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:02,471
l don`t remember frump girl,
but l remember you.

313
00:31:06,052 --> 00:31:09,544
Okay, no Greek.
ltalian, tomorrow night?

314
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:13,017
Okay.

315
00:31:16,196 --> 00:31:18,130
Where are you going?

316
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:22,163
l`m taking a pottery class.

317
00:31:23,036 --> 00:31:25,231
The Greeks invented pottery.

318
00:31:41,721 --> 00:31:45,851
...didn`t have a taste for it.
l like poetry.

319
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:48,354
lt`s crazy, right?

320
00:31:48,561 --> 00:31:51,257
lt was just me, all alone,
up in the mountains...

321
00:31:51,464 --> 00:31:54,092
in this cottage with
my parents all summer.

322
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,701
Well, don`t all your cousins
go up too?

323
00:31:58,138 --> 00:32:03,542
No. l only have two cousins.
They live in Wisconsin.

324
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:08,206
-You only have two cousins?
-Yeah. How many do you have?

325
00:32:08,481 --> 00:32:10,574
More than two.

326
00:32:10,984 --> 00:32:15,819
Who else? Do you have brothers and
sisters? What are your parents like?

327
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:20,892
What?

328
00:32:21,294 --> 00:32:23,421
Well...

329
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:29,758
Okay. Christmas. What do you do
for Christmas with your family?

330
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,561
My mom makes roast lamb.

331
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,234
With mint jelly?

332
00:32:38,812 --> 00:32:41,246
And...?

333
00:32:41,748 --> 00:32:44,342
And...

334
00:32:49,556 --> 00:32:51,387
...l`m Greek, right?
-Right.

335
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:56,324
So my dad and my uncles fight over
who gets to eat the lamb brain.

336
00:32:56,529 --> 00:32:59,692
My aunt Voula forks the eyeball
and chases me around with it...

337
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:02,129
trying to get me to eat it, because
it`s going to make me smart.

338
00:33:02,469 --> 00:33:07,270
You have 2 cousins. l have 27 first
cousins, just 27 first cousins alone.

339
00:33:07,474 --> 00:33:09,942
My whole family is big and loud...

340
00:33:10,143 --> 00:33:12,873
and everybody`s in each other`s
lives and business all the time.

341
00:33:13,146 --> 00:33:17,981
You never have a minute alone to
think. We`re always together, eating.

342
00:33:18,184 --> 00:33:21,517
All the other people we know
are Greeks. Greeks marry Greeks...

343
00:33:21,721 --> 00:33:25,157
to breed more Greeks,
to be loud breeding Greek eaters.

344
00:33:27,894 --> 00:33:29,122
l`m serious!

345
00:33:29,329 --> 00:33:33,322
No one in my family has ever gone out
with a non-Greek before. No one.

346
00:33:35,668 --> 00:33:37,693
And you`re...

347
00:33:39,138 --> 00:33:40,605
You`re...

348
00:33:40,807 --> 00:33:44,334
God, you`re just wonderful.

349
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,548
But l just don`t see how
this is going to work out, so...

350
00:33:52,352 --> 00:33:55,082
Work out?
What`s to work out?

351
00:33:55,522 --> 00:33:58,082
We`re not a different species.

352
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:01,124
Yes, we come from
different backgrounds and...

353
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:06,731
Hey, here`s some news about
my life to this point: it`s boring.

354
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:12,500
Then l met you, and you`re
interesting, beautiful and fun.

355
00:34:13,473 --> 00:34:16,442
You`ve got a weird family.
Who doesn`t?

356
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:25,045
l just want to spend
some time with you.

357
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:30,621
l just want to spend
a little time with you.

358
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:34,584
Did you say l`m beautiful?

359
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:07,822
Yes.

360
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:26,000
-Which house is yours?
-This is good. Could you stop?

361
00:35:26,212 --> 00:35:29,010
-Sure.
-Right here is good. Just stop.

362
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:31,880
Thanks.

363
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,231
Good night.

364
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:55,402
Good night.

365
00:36:26,072 --> 00:36:27,630
Good night.

366
00:36:30,877 --> 00:36:32,970
Good night.

367
00:36:44,223 --> 00:36:46,555
-Okay, good night.
-What?

368
00:36:46,759 --> 00:36:48,750
No, no, don`t go.

369
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:00,939
Good night.

370
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,937
Don`t go.

371
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:36,165
And I can make a man out of you
Because I`m a woman

372
00:37:36,409 --> 00:37:39,776
W-O-M-A-N

373
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,141
-Happy again today, Toula?
-Yeah.

374
00:37:45,518 --> 00:37:48,487
Now, every time l see you,
you have a great big smile.

375
00:37:50,356 --> 00:37:52,756
-Hey, Niko, where did you go?
-Nowhere.

376
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:54,392
-What did you do?
-Nothing.

377
00:37:54,594 --> 00:37:55,959
-Who did you see?
-No one.

378
00:37:56,229 --> 00:38:00,256
Wait a minute, Niko. l put them
in your room. Toula.

379
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,460
Your class...
How is your class?

380
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,495
My pottery class?

381
00:38:06,906 --> 00:38:09,602
-lt`s great.
-Good. Good.

382
00:38:28,394 --> 00:38:31,022
-You`ve got to get out of here.
-Just one more kiss and l`ll go.

383
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:33,921
No.

384
00:38:39,472 --> 00:38:41,770
What is going on?

385
00:38:43,142 --> 00:38:46,111
Mr. Pottery Class.
Nice to meet you.

386
00:38:48,881 --> 00:38:53,511
-lan, this is my cousin Nikki.
-Oh, hello.

387
00:38:54,053 --> 00:38:56,681
lt`s nice to finally meet
a member of Toula`s family.

388
00:38:56,889 --> 00:38:59,414
Yeah, well...

389
00:39:03,763 --> 00:39:07,199
l`m the least of your worries.
Listen, the family knows.

390
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:12,597
Last night, Vicky Pavalopolis saw
you sucking his lips in a parking lot.

391
00:39:12,805 --> 00:39:16,741
She told her ma,
who told my ma, who told your ma.

392
00:39:16,943 --> 00:39:19,241
Let me put it this way:
you`re busted!

393
00:39:19,445 --> 00:39:23,176
You sneak around all over Chicago
but you never come here to ask me...

394
00:39:23,382 --> 00:39:25,213
can you date my daughter?

395
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:29,920
l`m sorry, but ask you
if l can date your daughter?

396
00:39:30,122 --> 00:39:34,422
-Sir, she`s 30 years old.
-I am the head of this house!

397
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:39,489
Okay. May l please
date your daughter?

398
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,134
No!

399
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:50,866
-l`ll see you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

400
00:39:53,512 --> 00:39:55,207
Excuse me.

401
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,618
Didn`t l say it`s a mistake
to educate women?

402
00:40:07,827 --> 00:40:11,194
But nobody listened to me.

403
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:15,489
Now we have a boyfriend
in the house.

404
00:40:15,701 --> 00:40:21,105
ls he a nice Greek boy?
Oh, no, no Greek!

405
00:40:21,307 --> 00:40:23,366
No Greek, a ``xeno``!

406
00:40:23,576 --> 00:40:28,377
A ``xeno`` with big long hairs
on top of his head.

407
00:40:28,848 --> 00:40:31,009
Costa...

408
00:40:37,223 --> 00:40:39,885
l`m sorry l lied to you.

409
00:40:50,436 --> 00:40:52,404
Okay, Toula.

410
00:40:52,605 --> 00:40:55,267
Maybe you are having
a little romance.

411
00:40:58,711 --> 00:41:01,236
But end it now.

412
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:06,316
l love him.

413
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:08,783
Toula, eat something!

414
00:41:09,488 --> 00:41:11,149
Please.

415
00:41:21,968 --> 00:41:24,994
Your father
has a friend for dinner.

416
00:42:05,311 --> 00:42:07,404
What`s this? Where are we?

417
00:42:08,581 --> 00:42:10,378
My apartment.

418
00:42:11,183 --> 00:42:13,048
Do you want to go up?

419
00:42:52,391 --> 00:42:54,484
This is it.

420
00:43:55,788 --> 00:43:57,983
Don`t worry.
They are going to love you.

421
00:44:04,063 --> 00:44:07,157
Toula. Now, that`s not
a name you hear every day.

422
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,934
Does it mean anything
in your language?

423
00:44:10,402 --> 00:44:14,463
Well, my Greek name, Fortoula,
means ``light of God``.

424
00:44:17,176 --> 00:44:19,337
Who would like a coffee?

425
00:44:21,647 --> 00:44:26,448
So, you`re Greek?
What`s you last name?

426
00:44:26,652 --> 00:44:30,247
-Portokalos.
-ln Greek, it means ``orange``.

427
00:44:30,456 --> 00:44:35,120
Like an orange that you eat, like
the one with a peel. Not the color.

428
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,064
Yeah, it`s really Greek.

429
00:44:41,233 --> 00:44:44,566
Rodney, didn`t you once
have a Greek receptionist?

430
00:44:45,604 --> 00:44:48,471
No, Harriet, she was...

431
00:44:50,509 --> 00:44:53,569
-Just a minute.
-Oh, no, no, she was Armenian.

432
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,242
-ls Armenia close to Greece?
-Not exactly.

433
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,445
-What was she?
-Who?

434
00:44:59,652 --> 00:45:03,713
-My secretary, for heaven sake.
-Everyone like cheesecake?

435
00:45:04,723 --> 00:45:08,819
-Guatemalan.
-That`s right. She was Guatemalan.

436
00:45:39,425 --> 00:45:40,983
l love you.

437
00:45:42,861 --> 00:45:44,726
l love you.

438
00:45:52,571 --> 00:45:54,436
l don`t...

439
00:45:55,808 --> 00:45:58,709
l don`t know how to say this.

440
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,640
What?

441
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,945
Will you marry me?

442
00:46:08,153 --> 00:46:11,020
Yes! Yes!

443
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:18,327
Now you can have this.

444
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:05,305
Enough.

445
00:47:05,544 --> 00:47:07,409
Enough!

446
00:47:09,648 --> 00:47:13,482
What? Don`t you walk
away from me. Sit down!

447
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:23,390
Costa, they love each other.

448
00:47:23,962 --> 00:47:26,157
lt`s done!

449
00:47:26,665 --> 00:47:31,693
How? How can she do this to me?

450
00:47:32,638 --> 00:47:36,472
She didn`t do this
to you or to me.

451
00:47:36,675 --> 00:47:39,701
They fell in love. lt happens.

452
00:47:40,446 --> 00:47:43,313
ls he a good boy?
l don`t know.

453
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:48,109
ls he from a good family?
l don`t know.

454
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,780
ls he respectful? l don`t know,
l don`t know, l don`t know...

455
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:56,688
because nobody talks to me
about nothing no more!

456
00:47:56,895 --> 00:48:00,695
A respectful boy would come here
and ask for my permission!

457
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:05,300
My daughter engaged to a ``xeno``!

458
00:48:05,571 --> 00:48:10,201
l always thought she was going to be
married in the Greek orthodox church!

459
00:48:10,642 --> 00:48:13,236
Why is she doing this to me?

460
00:48:19,284 --> 00:48:22,378
...leaves a space. Sometimes,
that space is so big that...

461
00:48:22,588 --> 00:48:25,580
the roof can`t support itself,
so it collapses.

462
00:48:31,563 --> 00:48:33,463
Excuse me.

463
00:48:33,966 --> 00:48:36,526
Try not to be too loud.

464
00:48:47,513 --> 00:48:50,038
What`s going on?

465
00:48:51,517 --> 00:48:53,246
-Are you okay?
-Can we go to Vegas?

466
00:48:53,452 --> 00:48:55,511
-What?
-Or go to Niagara Falls.

467
00:48:55,721 --> 00:48:59,054
-Or to Fiji. Want to go to Fiji?
-Sure.

468
00:48:59,258 --> 00:49:02,022
Okay. Let`s go, come on.
Let`s just go.

469
00:49:02,594 --> 00:49:06,121
Come here. What`s the matter?

470
00:49:08,801 --> 00:49:12,362
We can`t get married.
Not like this.

471
00:49:14,006 --> 00:49:16,702
lt`s like, when l`m with you...

472
00:49:17,376 --> 00:49:20,004
l`m so happy.

473
00:49:20,612 --> 00:49:23,274
But my family is so unhappy.

474
00:49:23,615 --> 00:49:26,015
And our wedding should be
this joyous thing...

475
00:49:26,218 --> 00:49:28,846
but it won`t be for them,
because it can`t be at our church.

476
00:49:29,121 --> 00:49:33,524
So let`s just go somewhere.
Please, let`s just go. Let`s just go!

477
00:49:35,461 --> 00:49:37,224
l love you.

478
00:49:37,463 --> 00:49:41,331
Why? Why do you love me?

479
00:49:42,267 --> 00:49:45,236
Because l came alive
when l met you.

480
00:49:46,538 --> 00:49:48,165
But my family...

481
00:49:50,142 --> 00:49:52,303
You`re a part of your family...

482
00:49:53,479 --> 00:49:59,679
and l`ll do anything, whatever
it takes to get them to accept me.

483
00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:03,679
Because you`re my life now,
you`re my whole life now.

484
00:50:03,889 --> 00:50:07,518
We`re not going to skulk off
and get married...

485
00:50:07,726 --> 00:50:10,661
as if we were ashamed
of ourselves.

486
00:50:10,863 --> 00:50:12,694
Okay?

487
00:50:17,169 --> 00:50:21,333
Did you say ``skulk``?
Let`s just skulk off somewhere...

488
00:50:25,677 --> 00:50:30,307
Come on, talk to him. Toula loves
him. Do it for Toula, come on.

489
00:50:31,216 --> 00:50:34,242
Come on! He wants
to get married in the church!

490
00:50:34,786 --> 00:50:37,482
-Go, go!
-All right.

491
00:50:46,899 --> 00:50:50,835
So, you`re going to be
baptized tomorrow, huh?

492
00:50:54,339 --> 00:50:56,170
Yeah.

493
00:50:57,442 --> 00:51:02,778
lt`s your lucky day to be baptized
in the Greek orthodox church!

494
00:51:04,249 --> 00:51:06,410
Nikki is going to be
your godmother.

495
00:51:10,756 --> 00:51:14,419
You know, the word ``baptism``...

496
00:51:15,294 --> 00:51:18,752
comes from the
Greek word ``vaticia``.

497
00:51:18,964 --> 00:51:24,493
That`s where we dip the baby,
in a beautiful little silver basin.

498
00:52:00,339 --> 00:52:02,170
lt`s not so bad, huh?

499
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:05,908
Are you kidding? Any minute now
he`s going to look at me and go:

500
00:52:06,111 --> 00:52:08,602
``Right. You`re so not worth this.``

501
00:52:09,781 --> 00:52:12,045
Yes, you are.

502
00:52:30,068 --> 00:52:32,036
You`re all oily.

503
00:52:32,938 --> 00:52:34,906
l`m Greek now.

504
00:52:36,108 --> 00:52:38,406
Thank you so much.

505
00:52:39,344 --> 00:52:41,005
Thank you.

506
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:52,885
So, for Happy Easter, we say:
``Christós Anésti``.

507
00:52:53,091 --> 00:52:55,685
Then the other person says back:
``Alithós Anésti``.

508
00:52:55,894 --> 00:52:58,419
So if you wanna say Happy Easter,
you go: ``Christós Anésti``.

509
00:52:58,697 --> 00:53:00,187
So try it.

510
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:04,230
lt`s good.

511
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,898
Hey, dad.

512
00:53:13,845 --> 00:53:15,073
Mr. Portokalos...

513
00:53:17,282 --> 00:53:19,773
When my people were
writing philosophy...

514
00:53:19,985 --> 00:53:23,045
your people were still
swinging from trees.

515
00:53:24,022 --> 00:53:25,922
-He likes you.
-Oh, yeah?

516
00:53:26,258 --> 00:53:30,752
-l told you to watch the boys!
-They`re having fun with videogames!

517
00:53:31,496 --> 00:53:34,624
-You`ll turn their brains to mush.
-l can`t do anything right!

518
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:37,859
lan, if you`re going to be in this
family, l`ll get you some ear plugs.

519
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:42,097
The Portokalos women, if they`re
not nagging somebody, they die!

520
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:47,372
-You`re in trouble. l`ll tell her!
-Tell me what?

521
00:53:50,315 --> 00:53:52,476
Where is she? Let me see you!

522
00:53:59,091 --> 00:54:01,753
Toula, you`re engaged!

523
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,760
We never thought it could
happen for you, never!

524
00:54:05,964 --> 00:54:08,956
-Taki, didn`t we say that?
-We never thought the day`d come.

525
00:54:09,167 --> 00:54:12,330
Never, and it came!
ls this him?

526
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:15,472
-Yes, sorry. Everyone, this is lan.
-lan!

527
00:54:17,709 --> 00:54:20,678
Christ is risen for sure,
if Toula found a husband.

528
00:54:20,879 --> 00:54:22,574
Toula found a husband!

529
00:54:25,217 --> 00:54:26,980
Nice to meet you.

530
00:54:53,912 --> 00:54:55,436
Hello, lan!

531
00:55:14,566 --> 00:55:16,158
l want to see the bride.

532
00:55:21,006 --> 00:55:23,770
-Hey, lan. Do you like that dance?
-Oh, yeah.

533
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:28,079
-Jenny wants to ask you something.
-No, she does.

534
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,145
Jenny, just ask me.

535
00:55:30,348 --> 00:55:33,511
-Does he have any brothers?
-No, he`s an only child.

536
00:55:34,052 --> 00:55:36,782
You know, l`ve got to tell you.
l`ve never seen my sister so happy.

537
00:55:38,523 --> 00:55:41,788
lf you hurt her, l`ll kill you
and make it look like an accident.

538
00:55:43,361 --> 00:55:46,660
lan, Jesus, look at your face.
lt`s just a joke. lt`s just a joke.

539
00:55:46,998 --> 00:55:49,933
-Good one.
-The good one is l`ve got a gun.

540
00:55:50,135 --> 00:55:55,163
l`ve got a gun and l swear l`ll
jam it right up... l got you again!

541
00:55:55,574 --> 00:55:58,008
-Here, have some rice.
-l don`t... l`m good.

542
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:01,236
Good? You know, l could
snap you like a chicken!

543
00:56:01,513 --> 00:56:06,576
Come on, lighten up! l`ll lighten you
when l take out your kidneys.

544
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,787
-One more time, lan! Hey, Angelo!
-lan, we`re going to kill you!

545
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:45,853
lan, aunt Voula.
Let me touch your hair.

546
00:56:46,057 --> 00:56:47,957
Let me.

547
00:56:50,795 --> 00:56:55,095
-``Thea`` Voula? ``Thea`` Voula, okay.
-Okay, okay.

548
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:59,036
-You come to my house and l`ll cook.
-Okay.

549
00:56:59,304 --> 00:57:02,967
-``Thea``, that might be a problem.
-l`m the best cook here. Tell him.

550
00:57:03,408 --> 00:57:04,966
-Oh, l did. Didn`t l?
-Twice.

551
00:57:05,176 --> 00:57:06,734
Okay, then.

552
00:57:08,046 --> 00:57:09,946
lt`s just...

553
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:16,080
lan is a vegetarian.
He doesn`t eat meat.

554
00:57:17,555 --> 00:57:20,683
-He ``don`t`` eat no meat?
-No, he doesn`t eat meat.

555
00:57:20,892 --> 00:57:23,224
What do you mean,
he ``don`t`` eat no meat?

556
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:33,165
Oh, that`s okay. l make lamb.
Come. Come. Dance.

557
00:57:39,744 --> 00:57:41,336
Greek. You watch.

558
00:58:06,643 --> 00:58:08,338
Silence.

559
00:58:10,914 --> 00:58:12,279
lt`s delicious.

560
00:58:14,785 --> 00:58:18,221
We took a look at my calendar...
our calendar and...

561
00:58:19,056 --> 00:58:25,359
set a day for the big day some time
at the end of October, mid November.

562
00:58:25,562 --> 00:58:28,053
-Some time there, yeah.
-Wonderful.

563
00:58:28,265 --> 00:58:32,133
-l`ll call the club, see what`s open.
-The club?

564
00:58:32,669 --> 00:58:35,638
The North Shore Country Club.
For the wedding, of course.

565
00:58:36,506 --> 00:58:40,306
We`ll get married in Toula`s church,
because we`re not very religious...

566
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:45,311
and her family is, really is.
Show them the brochure.

567
00:58:45,515 --> 00:58:47,346
Oh, that.

568
00:58:50,554 --> 00:58:53,648
My cousin Nikki made me this.

569
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:59,155
She tends to save things. This is
from her prom. She makes lamps...

570
00:58:59,362 --> 00:59:03,696
We got this great big hall.
What`s it called, for the reception?

571
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,162
Aphrodite`s Palace.

572
00:59:05,869 --> 00:59:08,064
lt`s not really a palace.

573
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,705
Here`s a brochure.

574
00:59:15,545 --> 00:59:18,412
That Parthenon backdrop...
That`s optional.

575
00:59:22,853 --> 00:59:27,222
Maria, if we invited the Demakopolis,
we have to invite the Adamopolis!

576
00:59:27,557 --> 00:59:29,047
They`re cousins!

577
00:59:31,762 --> 00:59:34,196
Dad, the thing is that
we just want to keep it small.

578
00:59:34,397 --> 00:59:37,855
You`d rather go bankrupt than
insult anyone from the church.

579
00:59:38,235 --> 00:59:44,504
Toula, l came to this country
with US$ 8 in my pocket...

580
00:59:44,741 --> 00:59:47,232
to make all this for you.

581
00:59:49,913 --> 00:59:54,043
Who knows how long
l`m going to be alive?

582
00:59:55,719 --> 00:59:57,778
Let me see the list.

583
00:59:58,855 --> 01:00:02,586
Okay! Okay!
Come on, time out!

584
01:00:02,793 --> 01:00:06,422
-No more punching my ` nads, okay?
-Stop hitting ``theo`` Nikko!

585
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:10,122
Look at you!
How big you are!

586
01:00:10,801 --> 01:00:14,601
-Yanni, take them to soccer practice!
-Boys, come on, soccer practice!

587
01:00:15,138 --> 01:00:18,198
-Did she spit on him?
-Boys, go outside with your father.

588
01:00:18,408 --> 01:00:21,900
Yeah, it`s for good luck.
lt keeps the devil away.

589
01:00:22,112 --> 01:00:23,943
Bye! Wait for me!

590
01:00:25,448 --> 01:00:27,109
Dad.

591
01:00:29,486 --> 01:00:34,287
-Where did you get that?
-l drew it for the menu, remember?

592
01:00:38,829 --> 01:00:43,732
-Mom, l`m hungry.
-Okay, Niko. lan, are you hungry?

593
01:00:44,234 --> 01:00:47,294
-No, l already ate.
-Okay, l`ll make you something.

594
01:00:48,004 --> 01:00:49,596
Okay.

595
01:00:49,806 --> 01:00:53,173
Now, Toula, we have to have
Tommy Cassimatis.

596
01:00:55,545 --> 01:00:58,981
-Hey, let me help you with those.
-What is wrong with Tommy?

597
01:00:59,182 --> 01:01:01,616
-l don`t know them, okay?
-Who cares? They`re related to me!

598
01:01:01,818 --> 01:01:04,878
-Why are you being so weird?
-l`m not being weird.

599
01:01:13,163 --> 01:01:16,291
lan, eat, eat!

600
01:01:17,701 --> 01:01:20,397
How do you say
``thank you`` in Greek?

601
01:01:22,973 --> 01:01:24,770
That`s it. You got it.

602
01:01:25,008 --> 01:01:26,532
Nice boobs.

603
01:01:34,217 --> 01:01:36,014
Dad...

604
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:43,890
Toula! Listen, l`ve got the greatest
connection for your invitations.

605
01:01:44,694 --> 01:01:47,185
No, Nick, we`re going to order
our own invitations, okay?

606
01:01:47,397 --> 01:01:51,163
l don`t want us to have something
that falls off the back of a truck.

607
01:01:51,468 --> 01:01:54,631
-Yeah, but they come through, right?
-For God`s sake, let the man talk!

608
01:01:54,838 --> 01:01:58,274
-Why are you always so stubborn?
-Toula, Athena...

609
01:01:58,475 --> 01:02:02,969
l ordered the invitations
two weeks ago.

610
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:07,907
-l never saw a wedding invitation.
-l`ll go get them.

611
01:02:13,156 --> 01:02:14,316
They`re beautiful.

612
01:02:14,557 --> 01:02:16,957
-Ma!
-Wait until you see them.

613
01:02:19,629 --> 01:02:22,689
-They`re nice.
-Bravo, Maria.

614
01:02:29,205 --> 01:02:32,231
My parents` names are
Rodney and Harriet.

615
01:02:33,777 --> 01:02:37,440
-``Rodney and Harry``?
-``Rodney and Harry``.

616
01:02:37,747 --> 01:02:41,945
-``Rodney and Harry``!
-l didn`t notice. l bet they won`t.

617
01:02:42,152 --> 01:02:44,586
``Yatzis``, everybody.
Hi, Yaya.

618
01:02:44,788 --> 01:02:49,691
Wait, l have got the biggest scoop.
Look at the earrings...

619
01:02:49,893 --> 01:02:53,260
l found that match
the bridesmaids` dresses!

620
01:02:53,463 --> 01:02:58,298
A customer at the dry-cleaners
is a custom jewelry designer.

621
01:02:58,501 --> 01:03:01,664
-So l showed her the fabric...
-Wait, what do these match?

622
01:03:01,871 --> 01:03:05,466
-Not that fabric you showed me?
-You said you liked it.

623
01:03:05,675 --> 01:03:09,668
-l said l`d think about it.
-That`s just because...

624
01:03:11,114 --> 01:03:14,140
you couldn`t visualize it.

625
01:03:15,051 --> 01:03:17,315
-Nikki!
-You`re so beautiful!

626
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,750
-You don`t have to do a thing.
-That`s classy!

627
01:03:22,025 --> 01:03:24,391
I went by the college
and picked this up.

628
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:29,155
Look.

629
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:34,770
l`m going to start slowly,
doing a couple of night courses.

630
01:03:36,106 --> 01:03:41,601
l just wanted to learn more
about painting, and art and stuff.

631
01:03:41,945 --> 01:03:44,937
This is so great.

632
01:03:45,215 --> 01:03:49,709
You started it.
You wanted to do something else...

633
01:03:50,086 --> 01:03:52,179
and you did it.

634
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:55,524
Toula...

635
01:03:55,892 --> 01:03:59,055
don`t let your past
dictate who you are...

636
01:03:59,262 --> 01:04:02,288
but let it be part
of who you will become.

637
01:04:03,566 --> 01:04:06,034
Nick, that is so beautiful.

638
01:04:08,038 --> 01:04:11,838
That Dear Abby... She really
knows what she`s talking about.

639
01:04:28,058 --> 01:04:29,821
Hi, ma. It`s me.

640
01:04:30,427 --> 01:04:34,796
All right. lan is going to come pick
me up, then we`ll get his parents...

641
01:04:34,998 --> 01:04:37,159
and we`ll be there
in one hour, okay?

642
01:04:37,367 --> 01:04:40,359
-Good.
-Everything okay? What are you doing?

643
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:44,233
-l peeled the potatoes?
-What for? l peeled them this morning.

644
01:04:44,441 --> 01:04:46,636
l know, but we need more.

645
01:04:46,843 --> 01:04:49,744
-How much are you cooking?
-lt`s a lot of people!

646
01:04:50,447 --> 01:04:52,847
-There`s three of them.
-And us.

647
01:04:53,216 --> 01:04:55,810
-That makes seven.
-And the family.

648
01:04:57,887 --> 01:05:01,721
The family?
You invited the whole family?

649
01:05:02,192 --> 01:05:04,558
-Of course!
-Ma...

650
01:05:04,761 --> 01:05:07,992
l said, ``Come for a quiet dinner
and meet my parents``.

651
01:05:08,431 --> 01:05:11,298
They might as well meet
the whole family, right?

652
01:05:11,501 --> 01:05:14,561
-Maria!
-l`ve got to go. Taki is here. Bye!

653
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,340
l`m coming!

654
01:05:22,278 --> 01:05:25,406
Look! Bravo!

655
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:28,442
Okay, hurry, put it on the spit!

656
01:06:05,355 --> 01:06:08,153
lt`s them! They`re here!

657
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,795
Excuse me, excuse me.

658
01:06:15,732 --> 01:06:17,859
Welcome to my home.

659
01:06:19,736 --> 01:06:24,298
Over here is my brother, Ted,
and his wife, Melissa...

660
01:06:24,507 --> 01:06:27,635
and their children,
Anita, Diane and Nick.

661
01:06:27,844 --> 01:06:31,075
Over here, my brother, Tommy,
his wife, Angie...

662

01:06:34,417 --> 01:06:37,352
And here, my brother, George,
his wife, Frida...

01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:04,306
They`re here? Where?
Excuse me!

670
01:07:06,049 --> 01:07:08,176
Hello.

671
01:07:09,786 --> 01:07:15,520
l am Maria Portokalos.
And welcome to our home.

672
01:07:22,732 --> 01:07:26,793
-Thank you. What is it?
-lt`s a bundt.

673
01:07:27,337 --> 01:07:29,567
-A bun?
-Bundt.

674
01:07:29,872 --> 01:07:33,000
-Bonk, bonk.
-Bundt.

675
01:07:33,309 --> 01:07:35,641
Bonnet?

676
01:07:35,845 --> 01:07:39,281
-Bundt. Bundt!
-lt`s okay.

677
01:07:39,482 --> 01:07:41,882
lt`s a cake!

678
01:07:43,653 --> 01:07:47,521
lt`s a cake! l know!

679
01:07:48,758 --> 01:07:52,353
Thank you.
Thank you very, very much.

680
01:07:54,897 --> 01:07:57,764
There`s a hole in this cake.

681
01:07:58,635 --> 01:08:01,604
-These are some of my cousins.
-lan.

682
01:08:01,804 --> 01:08:03,271
-Nick.
-Good to see you, man.

683
01:08:03,473 --> 01:08:07,569
Listen, you know, l really think
you should say ``Eho tria archidia``.

684
01:08:07,777 --> 01:08:11,235
lt means ``Everyone, let`s come in
the house``. l think they will like it.

685
01:08:11,447 --> 01:08:15,076
-``Eho tria orchidia``?
-That`s good. You got it.

686
01:08:15,285 --> 01:08:18,118
-l`m not falling for that again.
-What?

687
01:08:18,321 --> 01:08:23,452
``What?``. Angelo! How do you say,
``Everyone, let`s go in the house``?

688
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:26,288
``Eho tria archidia.``

689
01:08:27,664 --> 01:08:29,461
Everyone!

690
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:31,361
l have three testicles.

691
01:08:36,139 --> 01:08:37,697
You`re in so much trouble!

692
01:08:38,608 --> 01:08:42,704
So this is from Mikonos.
Beautiful island.

693
01:08:42,912 --> 01:08:45,244
That`s where we`re from.

694
01:08:45,581 --> 01:08:48,345
You like them? l make them.

695
01:08:49,719 --> 01:08:54,588
Come, sit down.
Go, go. Sit, sit. Come.

696
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:57,726
-Sit down. Sit down.
-Thank you.

697
01:08:59,429 --> 01:09:01,590
Now, you are family.

698
01:09:01,931 --> 01:09:04,866
Okay. All my life...

699
01:09:05,068 --> 01:09:09,266
l had a lump at the back of
my neck, right here. Always a lump.

700
01:09:10,173 --> 01:09:16,169
Then l started menopause, and the
lump got bigger, from the hormones.

701
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:22,611
So l went to the doctor
and he did the bio... the bios...

702
01:09:22,819 --> 01:09:24,912
the ``bobopsy``.

703
01:09:25,288 --> 01:09:30,817
And inside the lump,
he found teeth and a spinal cord.

704
01:09:33,429 --> 01:09:37,593
Yes. lnside the lump was my twin.

705
01:09:42,472 --> 01:09:44,770
You hungry?

706
01:09:49,379 --> 01:09:53,816
They just got here.
Let them settle in.

707
01:09:54,016 --> 01:09:56,712
-l love it when you speak in Greek.
-Really?

708
01:09:56,919 --> 01:10:00,184
lt`s sexy.
Having a good time?

709
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:02,617
All right. Come on.

710
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:06,628
Rodney, Harry.

711
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:22,274
-lt`s licorice.
-lt`s delicious.

712
01:10:32,622 --> 01:10:36,581
Another. You`re Greek now.
Don`t be shy.

713
01:10:53,476 --> 01:10:56,536
Don`t worry, l`ll be back.

714
01:11:05,388 --> 01:11:08,619
The meat is here, everybody!

715
01:11:08,825 --> 01:11:12,124
Very good, very good.

716
01:11:12,728 --> 01:11:17,563
Would you like some Greek meat?
Very good.

717
01:11:18,801 --> 01:11:20,769
Would you like?

718
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:27,373
All right. Meat, everybody?

719
01:11:29,378 --> 01:11:31,676
Excuse me! Coming through,
coming through!

720
01:11:36,419 --> 01:11:39,582
And now, the ``bond`` cake!

721
01:11:39,789 --> 01:11:41,279
You fixed it!

722
01:11:41,491 --> 01:11:46,019
l tried, you tried!
We were all nice to them.

723
01:11:46,295 --> 01:11:49,093
And they looked at us
like we`re from the zoo.

724
01:11:49,298 --> 01:11:54,531
-Costa, please.
-This ``no`` work. This ``no`` work.

725
01:11:54,737 --> 01:11:58,901
They`re different people. So dry!

726
01:11:59,108 --> 01:12:01,406
That family is like a piece of toast.

727
01:12:01,677 --> 01:12:05,773
No honey, no jam, just dry.

728
01:12:06,048 --> 01:12:10,712
My daughter is going
to marry lan Miller...

729
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:15,084
a ``xeno``!
A ``xeno`` with a toast family!

730
01:12:15,391 --> 01:12:18,588
I never thought
this could happen to us.

731
01:12:18,794 --> 01:12:22,252
I tried to put a little marmalade.

732
01:12:22,465 --> 01:12:24,524
No, they don`t like that.

733
01:12:24,734 --> 01:12:28,932
They like it
all dry and cracked.

734
01:12:38,981 --> 01:12:43,782
The best man`s part of the ceremony,
he`s got to be Greek orthodox...

735
01:12:44,053 --> 01:12:48,149
so l can`t ask you to be my best
man, although technically, you are.

736
01:12:48,357 --> 01:12:53,226
You were going to ask me
to be your best man?

737
01:12:53,863 --> 01:12:56,161
l am touched!

738
01:12:56,799 --> 01:13:00,826
l had no idea you had
so few friends.

739
01:13:03,806 --> 01:13:09,608
You know, that`s okay. Just get me
a little badge that says ``best man``.

740
01:13:10,179 --> 01:13:15,742
No offense, but this girl`s family`s
got you by the short ones, huh?

741
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:19,982
They say ``jump``,
and you plop the trampoline.

742
01:13:22,959 --> 01:13:27,953
Yeah, okay.
My life is shit, okay.

743
01:13:28,164 --> 01:13:32,100
Mike, Toula`s got a lot of cousins.
l could fix you up.

744
01:13:32,301 --> 01:13:34,701
Yeah, that`s going to happen.

745
01:13:42,311 --> 01:13:44,279
Toula.

746
01:13:45,047 --> 01:13:47,277
What is wrong?

747
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:54,053
All right.
ls my marriage killing dad?

748
01:13:55,491 --> 01:13:58,688
Toula, your father is your father.

749
01:13:59,061 --> 01:14:03,430
-He just wants you to be happy.
-But l am happy.

750
01:14:11,207 --> 01:14:16,167
Listen to me, Toula.
My village saw many wars.

751
01:14:16,979 --> 01:14:21,848
Turkish, German...
They all made a mess.

752
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:29,856
And my mother, she said,
``We`re lucky to be alive!``.

753
01:14:30,426 --> 01:14:34,726
And l thought,
``We`re not lucky to be alive.

754
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:38,832
We`re not lucky when they`re
telling us where we should live...

755
01:14:39,035 --> 01:14:43,335
what we should eat!``.
Nobody has that right.

756
01:14:45,374 --> 01:14:48,104
And then l see you...

757
01:14:48,844 --> 01:14:52,439
and l see Athena and Niko.

758
01:14:52,982 --> 01:14:55,610
We came here for you...

759
01:14:55,818 --> 01:14:59,254
so you could live.

760
01:15:00,456 --> 01:15:05,223
l gave you life,
so that you could live it.

761
01:16:46,962 --> 01:16:51,262
Ma? The band needs
to be picked up at the airport!

762
01:16:57,106 --> 01:17:01,202
-Ma?
-The bride is awake!

763
01:17:04,613 --> 01:17:08,447
Wait! Wait!
What is that?

764
01:17:10,886 --> 01:17:13,081
Oh, my God.

765
01:17:18,327 --> 01:17:19,817
Where did everybody go?

766
01:17:26,202 --> 01:17:28,363
-lt`s a mosquito bite.
-lt`s a zit.

767
01:17:28,571 --> 01:17:30,596
l have cover-up.

768
01:17:32,441 --> 01:17:34,136
Hello, ladies. Fresh ``baklava``!

769
01:17:36,445 --> 01:17:39,573
-Get out of here!
-Give me the camera!

770
01:17:40,015 --> 01:17:43,451
-Give me the camera!
-Toula! Toula, help me! Come on!

771
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:47,250
-No boys allowed!
-Nice moustache, Nikki.

772
01:17:47,456 --> 01:17:49,617
-Thank you.
-Niko, let`s go.

773
01:17:49,825 --> 01:17:51,816
-ls that my tux?
-No, this one.

774
01:17:52,027 --> 01:17:55,929
-Go pick up the band at the airport.
-Okay.

775
01:17:56,498 --> 01:17:59,831
-What`s that thing?
-lt`s a mosquito bite.

776
01:18:00,035 --> 01:18:02,196
Put some Windex.

777
01:18:03,005 --> 01:18:05,132
l`ve got the cover-up.

778
01:18:06,108 --> 01:18:08,235
You`re all nuts!

779
01:18:08,444 --> 01:18:14,076
Why are you here? You`re supposed
to get changed at my house. Get out!

780
01:18:20,456 --> 01:18:22,856
-Toula, l want to talk to you.
-Now?

781
01:18:23,325 --> 01:18:27,523
This is a very special night for you.
You have your duties.

782
01:18:28,264 --> 01:18:31,597
One more, one more.
One big one! Hold on.

783
01:18:32,835 --> 01:18:38,239
Toula, on my wedding night,
my mother, she said to me...

784
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:42,570
``Greek women, we may
be lambs in the kitchen...

785
01:18:42,778 --> 01:18:45,679
but we are tigers in the bedroom.``

786
01:18:45,881 --> 01:18:48,247
Please let that be the end
of your speech.

787
01:18:48,684 --> 01:18:52,176
What is going on? Why aren`t you
ready? The photographer is here.

788
01:19:03,332 --> 01:19:05,596
-Do you need sponging?
-l`m all right!

789
01:19:27,156 --> 01:19:28,623
Yeah. More hairspray!

790
01:19:42,271 --> 01:19:43,260
She`s ready!

791
01:20:00,089 --> 01:20:02,489
l`m a snow beast.

792
01:21:05,087 --> 01:21:06,349
Oh, my God.

793
01:21:58,574 --> 01:22:03,876
-How do we know what`s going on?
-lt`s all Greek to me.

794
01:22:29,471 --> 01:22:31,462
This is it.

795
01:22:32,441 --> 01:22:34,409
What?

796
01:22:35,277 --> 01:22:40,112
We take our first steps
as husband and wife.

797
01:22:41,383 --> 01:22:44,546
-Are you ready?
-l`m ready.

798
01:23:49,117 --> 01:23:52,314
-Where are you? Are you in there?
-Yes!

799
01:23:53,055 --> 01:23:56,149
Don`t dab. Wipe!
Wipe off!

800
01:23:56,959 --> 01:23:59,427
-ls that better?
-Yeah.

801
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:03,660
Who did your make-up?
Your aunts?

802
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:07,632
Drag queens could get
a few tips from those aunts.

803
01:24:07,836 --> 01:24:10,805
Oh, my God, look at me!
l`m just covered! l`m covered!

804
01:24:11,006 --> 01:24:14,134
-Like a big frosted cupcake.
-l know. lt`s like...

805
01:24:15,577 --> 01:24:17,943
Come on, help me with the veil.

806
01:24:26,555 --> 01:24:29,956
-Wait.
-Yeah, you got it.

807
01:24:43,071 --> 01:24:45,631
Do we have to go in?

808
01:24:45,874 --> 01:24:48,308
Too late to elope now.

809
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:50,671
Let`s go in.

810
01:24:51,146 --> 01:24:52,977
Okay.

811
01:24:53,181 --> 01:24:57,083
Let me check this out.
lt`s going down, thank God.

812
01:24:57,919 --> 01:25:02,288
-What?
-l woke up with this huge zit.

813
01:25:03,292 --> 01:25:04,953
-Where?
-Right there.

814
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:08,561
-l had a huge zit this morning.
-You did? Where is it?

815
01:25:08,764 --> 01:25:11,358
-lt was here, but it`s gone now.
-Why?

816
01:25:11,566 --> 01:25:14,091
l put some Windex on it.

817
01:25:55,444 --> 01:26:00,347
Welcome to the Portokalos family.

818
01:26:01,717 --> 01:26:05,517
Welcome the Miller family.

819
01:26:06,355 --> 01:26:10,257
l was thinking last night...

820
01:26:10,459 --> 01:26:12,518
the night before my...

821
01:26:12,728 --> 01:26:16,562
daughter was going
to marry lan Miller...

822
01:26:16,765 --> 01:26:22,635
that the root of the word
``Miller`` is a Greek word.

823
01:26:24,139 --> 01:26:28,473
``Miller`` comes from
the Greek word ``milo``...

824
01:26:28,677 --> 01:26:32,010
which means ``apple``,
so there you go.

825
01:26:36,017 --> 01:26:40,386
As many of you know,
our name, Portokalos...

826
01:26:40,589 --> 01:26:45,959
comes from the Greek word
``portokali``, which means ``orange``.

827
01:26:46,161 --> 01:26:50,757
Okay, here tonight we have...

828
01:26:50,966 --> 01:26:54,333
apple and orange.

829
01:26:55,270 --> 01:26:58,330
We`re all different...

830
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:01,941
but, in the end, we`re all fruit.

831
01:27:05,347 --> 01:27:08,316
Yes, we`re all fruit.

832
01:27:12,654 --> 01:27:15,748
My wife and me, we have a gift.

833
01:27:16,091 --> 01:27:19,117
See, that`s what we do.
The parents, they give a gift.

834
01:27:24,566 --> 01:27:26,329
Here.

835
01:27:32,808 --> 01:27:36,869
Oh, my God.
They bought us a house.

836
01:28:11,646 --> 01:28:13,375
Thank you.

837
01:28:26,528 --> 01:28:28,553
l don`t believe that.

838
01:28:28,763 --> 01:28:30,754
A house!

839
01:28:40,709 --> 01:28:44,941
-``Thea`` Voula, we`re going to dance.
-l know, dear. Let me get Taki.

840
01:28:45,313 --> 01:28:48,282
Athena, l`m going to be a painter!

841
01:28:48,483 --> 01:28:51,043
Good! You can start
with our fence.

842
01:28:53,321 --> 01:28:56,256
This is just
a really nice wedding.

843
01:28:56,491 --> 01:28:59,085
That`s good. We`re going
to dance now. Come on!

844
01:28:59,294 --> 01:29:02,491
Oh, no. l think l need some
more of those before l do that.

845
01:29:02,998 --> 01:29:04,795
What do you say?

846
01:29:07,168 --> 01:29:09,159
Bottoms up!

847
01:29:12,574 --> 01:29:14,872
-All right.
-Let`s go, ``Harry``.

848
01:29:16,111 --> 01:29:18,375
Come on, Costa!

849
01:29:24,052 --> 01:29:26,520
Oh, Taki...

850
01:29:26,788 --> 01:29:28,881
he looks Greek.

851
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:35,918
That`s it. Like this.

852
01:29:37,399 --> 01:29:39,924
Everybody dance.

853
01:29:40,135 --> 01:29:42,831
Everybody dance, dance.

854
01:30:03,224 --> 01:30:06,523
Sometimes, I`m afraid
that it didn`t happen.

855
01:30:06,728 --> 01:30:09,458
I`m scared I`ll wake up and still
be buttering garlic bread...

856
01:30:09,664 --> 01:30:13,100
waiting for my life to start.
But it did happen.

857
01:30:13,301 --> 01:30:15,929
It did!
And I figured out some stuff.

858
01:30:16,137 --> 01:30:19,766
My family is big and loud,
but they`re my family.

859
01:30:19,975 --> 01:30:24,912
We fight, we laugh and, yes,
we roast lamb in the front yard.

860
01:30:25,113 --> 01:30:30,312
And wherever I go, whatever I do,
they will always be there.

861
01:30:36,958 --> 01:30:40,724
So, Ian and I moved into the house
my parents bought us.

862
01:30:40,929 --> 01:30:43,898
A minute later, I was pregnant,
and 6 years later...

863
01:30:44,099 --> 01:30:46,226
it was our daughter`s turn
to go to Greek school.

864
01:30:46,434 --> 01:30:49,631
-But mom, l want to go to Brownie`s!
-l know, l know...

865
01:30:49,838 --> 01:30:53,968
but l promise you this:
you can marry anybody you want.

866
01:30:54,175 --> 01:30:58,168
Thanks, baby.
Greek school, ``pomi``!

867
01:30:59,347 --> 01:31:01,315
-What does that mean?
-``Let`s go``.

868
01:31:01,516 --> 01:31:03,040
-Let`s go.
-That`s really good.

869
01:31:03,251 --> 01:31:04,479
-Looking good, Gus.
-Hi, dad.

870
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:07,415
-Where are you going?
-Greek school.

871
01:35:02,357 --> 01:35:05,349
