FENCES

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,133
#Arranged from script by yukorg#

3
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:08,461
Troy, you ought to stop that lying!

4
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:11,467
I ain't lying! The nigger had a watermelon this big.

5
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:13,288
"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"

6
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:14,670
I liked to fell out!

7
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:18,176
"What watermelon, Mr. Rand?"
And it sitting there big as life.

8
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:20,233
- What did Mr. Rand say?
- Ain't said nothing.

9
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:22,923
Figure if the nigger too dumb to know
he carrying a watermelon,

10
00:01:22,924 --> 00:01:24,683
he wasn't gonna get much sense out of him.

11
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:27,479
Trying to hide that great big old
watermelon under his coat.

12
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,099
Afraid to let the white man
see him carry it home.

13
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:33,427
I'm like you, I ain't got no time for
them kind of people.

14
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:34,728
Now what he look like getting mad

15
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:37,088
cause he see the man from the union talking to
Mr. Rand?

16
00:01:37,089 --> 00:01:38,389
He come to me talking about.

17
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,271
Maxson gonna get us fired.

18
00:01:40,272 --> 00:01:42,236
I told him to get away from me with that.

19
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:45,083
He walked away from me calling you a "troublemaker."

20
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:47,952
- What Mr. Rand say?
- Ain't said nothing.

21
00:01:47,953 --> 00:01:50,484
He told me to go down the Commissioner's office
next Friday.

22
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,361
They called me down there to see them.

23
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,673
Well, as long as you got your complaint filed,
they can't fire you.

24
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:58,407
That's what one of them white fellows tell me.
I ain't worried about them firing me.

25
00:01:58,408 --> 00:02:00,615
They gonna fire me cause I asked a question?

26
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,844
That's all I did. I went to Mr. Rand and asked him,

27
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,635
Why? Why you got the white
mens driving and the colored lifting?

28
00:02:07,636 --> 00:02:09,316
Told him what's the matter, don't I count?

29
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:11,791
You think only white fellows got sense
enough to drive a truck.

30
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:14,081
That ain't no paper job! Hell,
anybody can drive a truck.

31
00:02:14,082 --> 00:02:16,523
How come you got all whites driving and the
colored lifting?

32
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:20,752
He told me take it to the union."

33
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:23,823
Well, hell, that's what I done!
Now they wanna come up with this pack of lies.

34
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:27,764
I told Brownie if the man come and ask him any questions,
just tell the truth!

35
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:30,741
It ain't nothing but something they done trumped up on you
cause you filed a complaint on them.

36
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:33,601
Brownie don't understand nothing.

37
00:02:33,602 --> 00:02:35,670
All I want them to do is change the job
description.

38
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,358
Give everybody a chance to drive the truck.

39
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,442
Brownie can't see that. He ain't got that much sense.

40
00:03:02,827 --> 00:03:05,331
How you figure he be making out with that gal be up
at Taylors' all the time, that Alberta gal?

41
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:07,835
What is there in Taylor's? That of Alberta.

42
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:09,783
- Who?
- Well...

43
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:13,756
Same as you and me. Getting just as much as we is.
Which is to say nothing.

44
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:15,314
It is, huh?

45
00:03:15,315 --> 00:03:17,588
I figure you doing a little better than me.

46
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:19,202
and I ain't saying what I'm doing.

47
00:03:19,203 --> 00:03:21,496
Aw, nigger, took here, I know you.

48
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:23,356
If you had got anywhere near that gal,

49
00:03:23,357 --> 00:03:25,692
twenty minutes later you be looking to tell somebody.

50
00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:29,131
And the first one you gonna tell, that you gonna
want to brag to is gonna be me.

51
00:03:29,132 --> 00:03:30,746
I ain't saying that.

52
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:33,519
I see where you be eyeing her.

53
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,896
I eye all the women. I don't miss nothing.

54
00:03:35,897 --> 00:03:38,630
Don't never let nobody tell you Troy Maxson
don't eye the women.

55
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:41,186
You been doing more than eyeing her.
You done bought her a drink or two.

56
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,533
Hell yeah, I bought her a drink! What that mean?
I bought you one, too.

57
00:03:43,534 --> 00:03:46,617
What that mean cause I buy her a drink?
I'm just being polite.

58
00:03:46,618 --> 00:03:49,785
It's all right to buy her one drink.
That's what you call being polite.

59
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:53,302
But when you wanna be buying two or three,
that's what you call eyeing her.

60
00:03:53,303 --> 00:03:56,693
Look here, as long as you known me,
you ever known me to chase after women?

61
00:03:56,694 --> 00:04:00,731
Hell yeah! Long as I done known you.
You forgetting I knew you when.

62
00:04:00,732 --> 00:04:02,530
Naw, I'm talking about since I been married to Rose?

63
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:05,016
Oh, not since you been married to Rose.

64
00:04:05,017 --> 00:04:06,930
Now, that's the truth, there. I can say that.

65
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:08,592
All right then! Case closed.

66
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,621
I see you be walking up around Alberta's house.

67
00:04:11,622 --> 00:04:14,617
You supposed to be at Taylors'
and you be walking up around there.

68
00:04:14,618 --> 00:04:16,728
What you watching where I'm walking for?
I ain't watching after you.

69
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:18,947
I seen you walking around there more than once.

70
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:22,290
Hell, you liable to see me walking anywhere! That don't mean
nothing cause you see me walking around there.

71
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,987
Where she come from anyway?
She just kinda showed up one day.

72
00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:28,357
Tallahassee. You can look at her and tell
she one of them Florida gals.

73
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:30,635
They got some big healthy women down there.

74
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:32,353
Grow them right up out the ground.

75
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:34,346
Got a little bit of Indian in her.

76
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:36,512
Most of them niggers down in Florida got some
Indian in them.

77
00:04:36,513 --> 00:04:40,710
I don't know about that Indian part.
But she damn sure big and healthy.

78
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:43,673
Woman wear some big stockings.

79
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:48,112
Got them great big old legs and hips
as wide as the Mississippi River.

80
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:51,066
Legs don't mean nothing. You don't do nothing
but push them out of the way.

81
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:53,758
But them hips cushion the ride!

82
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,801
Troy, you ain't got no sense.

83
00:04:55,802 --> 00:04:58,545
It's the truth! Like you riding on Goodyears!

84
00:05:01,814 --> 00:05:03,892
What you all out here getting into?

85
00:05:03,893 --> 00:05:05,938
What you worried about what we getting into for?

86
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,362
This is men talk, woman.

87
00:05:07,363 --> 00:05:10,309
What I care what you all talking about?
Bono, you gonna stay for supper?

88
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,973
No, I thank you, Rose. But Lucille say
she cooking up a pot of pigfeet.

89
00:05:13,974 --> 00:05:16,397
Pigfeet! Hell, I'm going home with you!

90
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:18,344
Might even stay the night if you got some
pigfeet.

91
00:05:18,345 --> 00:05:20,366
You got something in there to top them pigfeet, Rose?

92
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,906
I'm cooking up some chicken. I got some
chicken and collard greens.

93
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:26,611
Well, go on back in the house and let me and Bono finish
what we was talking about. This is men talk.

94
00:05:26,612 --> 00:05:28,109
I got some talk for you later.

95
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,235
You know what kind of talk I mean.

96
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:33,453
- You go on and powder it up.
- Troy Stop!

97
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,973
Aw, woman, come here.

98
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:38,868
Look here, Bono

99
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:41,786
When first I met this woman,

100
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:44,034
I got out that place, say,

101
00:05:44,035 --> 00:05:47,369
"Hitch up my pony, saddle up my mare,

102
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,050
there's a woman out there for me somewhere."

103
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:53,554
I looked here. Looked there. Saw Rose
and latched on to her.

104
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:56,124
I latched on to her
and told her,

105
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,686
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

106
00:05:57,687 --> 00:05:59,053
I told her,

107
00:05:59,054 --> 00:06:01,364
"Baby, I don't wanna marry,

108
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:03,655
I just wanna be your man."

109
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:06,319
Rose told me... tell him what you told me, Rose.

110
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,191
I told him if he wasn't the marrying kind,

111
00:06:08,192 --> 00:06:10,644
then move out the way so
the marrying kind could find me.

112
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:13,192
That's what she told me. Nigger, you in my way.

113
00:06:13,193 --> 00:06:16,314
You blocking the view! Move out the way
so I can find me a husband.

114
00:06:16,315 --> 00:06:17,933
I thought it over two or three
days. Come back

115
00:06:17,934 --> 00:06:20,339
Ain't no two or three days nothing.
You was back the same night.

116
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,008
Come back, told her...

117
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:25,040
"Okay baby, but
I'm gonna buy me a banty rooster

118
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:27,823
and put him out there in the backyard
and when he see a stranger come,

119
00:06:27,824 --> 00:06:29,319
he'll flap his wings and crow."

120
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,691
Look here, Bono, I could watch
the front door by myself,

121
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,792
it was that back door
I was worried about.

122
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:37,093
Troy, you ought not talk like that.
Troy ain't doing nothing but telling a lie.

123
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:39,773
Only thing is when we first got
married forget the rooster,

124
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,410
we ain't had no yard!

125
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:45,060
I hear you tell it. Me and Lucille was staying
down there on Logan Street.

126
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:47,484
Had two rooms with the
outhouse in the back.

127
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:49,308
I ain't mind the outhouse none.

128
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:53,533
But when that goddamn wind blow through there
in the winter,that's what I'm talking about!

129
00:06:53,534 --> 00:06:57,745
To this day I wonder why in the hell I ever
stayed down there for six long years.

130
00:06:57,746 --> 00:07:00,479
But see, I didn't know I could do no better.

131
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,384
I thought only white folks had inside
toilets and things.

132
00:07:03,385 --> 00:07:06,190
There's a lot of people don't know they can do
no better than they doing now.

133
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:09,220
That's just something you got to learn.
A lot of folks still shop at Bella's.

134
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,195
Ain't nothing wrong with shopping at Bella's.
She got fresh food.

135
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:14,320
I ain't said nothing about if she got fresh food
I'm talking about what she charge.

136
00:07:14,321 --> 00:07:16,439
She charge ten cents more than the A&P.

137
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,597
The A&P ain't never done nothing for me.
I spends my money where I'm treated right.

138
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,612
I go down to Bella, say, I need a loaf of bread,
"I'll pay you Friday." She give it to me.

139
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:25,610
What sense that make when I got money to go

140
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,983
and spend it somewhere else and ignore
the person who done right by me?

141
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:31,243
That ain't in the Bible.
- We ain't talking about what's in the Bible.

142
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:33,078
What sense it make to shop there
when she overcharge?

143
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,770
You shop where you want to. I'll do my shopping
where the people been good to me.

144
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:38,516
Well, I don't think it's right for her to overcharge.
That's all I was saying.

145
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:41,253
Look here, I got to get on. Lucille be
raising all kind of hell.

146
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:44,413
Where you going, nigger? We ain't finished this pint.
Come here, finish this pint.

147
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:47,639
Well, hell, I am, if you ever turn
the bottle loose.

148
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:50,427
The only thing I say about the A&P is I'm glad

149
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,878
Cory got that job down there.

150
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,911
Help him take care of his
school clothes and things.

151
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:57,438
Gabe done moved out and things getting tight
around here.

152
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,139
He got that job, he can start
to look out for himself.

153
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,343
Cory done went and got recruited by a college
football team.

154
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:05,992
I told that boy about that college football stuff.

155
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:09,505
The white man ain't gonna let him
get nowhere with that football.

156
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:11,777
I told him when he first come to me
with it.

157
00:08:11,778 --> 00:08:14,212
Now you come telling me he done went
and got more tied up in it.

158
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:16,581
He ought to go and get recruite
in how to fix cars

159
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:18,093
or something where he can make a living.

160
00:08:18,094 --> 00:08:20,421
He ain't talking about making
no living playing football.

161
00:08:20,422 --> 00:08:22,269
It's just something the boys in school do.

162
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,157
They gonna send a recruiter by to talk to you.

163
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:26,729
He'll tell you heain't talking about
making no living playing football.

164
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,399
It's a honor to be recruited.

165
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,034
It ain't gonna get him nowhere.
Bono'll tell you that.

166
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:33,970
If he be like you in the sports,
he's gonna be all right.

167
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,824
Ain't but two men ever played
baseball as good as you.

168
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:38,903
That's Babe Ruth and Josh Gibson.

169
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:41,164
Them's the only two men ever hit
more home runs than you.

170
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:43,421
What it ever get me? Ain't got a pot to piss in

171
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:44,937
or a window to throw it out of.

172
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:46,656
Times have changed since you was
playing baseball, Troy

173
00:08:46,657 --> 00:08:48,867
That was before the war.
Times have changed a lot since then.

174
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:51,735
- How in hell they done changed?
- They got lots of colored boys playing ball now.

175
00:08:51,736 --> 00:08:54,248
- Baseball and football.
- You right about that, Rose

176
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:57,723
Times have changed, Troy.
You just come along too early.

177
00:08:57,724 --> 00:09:01,158
There ought not never have been no time
called too early!

178
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:04,104
Now you take that fellow

179
00:09:05,321 --> 00:09:07,812
what's that fellow they had playing right field
for the Yankees back then?

180
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,308
You know who I'm talking about, Bono.
Used to play right field for the Yankees.

181
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:11,701
- Selkirk?
- Selkirk! That's it!

182
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:14,101
Man batting .269, understand?

183
00:09:14,102 --> 00:09:16,292
.269. What kind of sense that make?

184
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:19,074
I was hitting .432 with thirty-seven home runs!

185
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:22,011
Man batting .269 and playing
right field for the Yankees!

186
00:09:22,012 --> 00:09:24,414
I saw Josh Gibson's daughter yesterday.

187
00:09:24,415 --> 00:09:26,985
She walking around with raggedy
shoes on her feet.

188
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:30,507
Now I bet you Selkirk's daughter ain't walking around
with raggedy shoes on her feet! I bet you that!

189
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:32,578
They got a lot of colored baseball players now.

190
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:35,332
Jackie Robinson was the first. Folks
had to wait for Jackie Robinson.

191
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,663
I done seen a hundred niggers play baseball
better than Jackie Robinson.

192
00:09:38,664 --> 00:09:41,427
Hell, I know some teams Jackie Robinson
couldn't even make!

193
00:09:41,428 --> 00:09:44,625
What you talking about Jackie Robinson.
Jackie Robinson wasn't nobody.

194
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,498
I'm talking about if you could play ball
then they ought to have let you play.

195
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:50,522
Don't care what color you were.
Come telling me I come along too early.

196
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,774
If you could play,
then they ought to have let you play.

197
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:56,839
You gonna drink yourself to death.
You don't need to be drinking like that.

198
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,559
Death ain't nothing. I done seen him.

199
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,738
Done wrassled with him. You can't tell me
nothing about death.

200
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:06,186
Death ain't nothing but a fastball
on the outside corner.

201
00:10:06,187 --> 00:10:08,235
And you know what I'll do to that!

202
00:10:08,236 --> 00:10:10,048
Lookee here, Bono, am I lying?

203
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:13,132
You get one of them fastballs,
about waist high,

204
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:14,757
over the outside corner of the plate

205
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:16,476
where you can get the meat of the bat on it

206
00:10:16,477 --> 00:10:20,831
and good god! You can kiss it goodbye.
Now, am I lying?

207
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:23,455
Naw, you telling the truth there. I seen you do it.

208
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,103
If I'm lying that 450 feet worth of lying!

209
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:28,732
That's all death is to me.

210
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:31,270
A fastball on the outside corner.

211
00:10:31,271 --> 00:10:33,548
I don't know why you want to get on
talking about death.

212
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,647
Ain't nothing wrong with talking about death.
That's part of life.

213
00:10:35,648 --> 00:10:40,052
Everybody gonna die. You gonna die, I'm gonna die.
Bono's gonna die. Hell, we all gonna die.

214
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:42,455
But you ain't got to talk about it.
I don't like to talk about it.

215
00:10:42,456 --> 00:10:45,406
You the one brought it up.
Me and Bono was talking about baseball

216
00:10:45,407 --> 00:10:48,696
you tell me I'm gonna drink myself to death.
Ain't that right, Bono?

217
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:51,203
You know I don't drink this
but one night out of the week.

218
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:53,913
That's Friday night. I'm gonna drink just
enough to where I can handle it.

219
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:55,581
Then I cuts it loose. I leave it alone.

220
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:57,956
So don't you worry about me
drinking myself to death.

221
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,557
'Cause I ain't worried about Death.

222
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,786
I done seen him. I done wrestled with him.

223
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:03,481
Look here, Bono

224
00:11:03,482 --> 00:11:07,029
I looked up one day and Death was marching
straight at me.

225
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,492
Like Soldiers on Parade! The Army of Death

226
00:11:10,493 --> 00:11:14,780
was marching straight at me.
The middle of July, 1941.

227
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:17,418
It got real cold just like it be winter.

228
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:21,116
It seem like Death himself reached out and
touched me on the shoulder.

229
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:23,131
He touch me just like I touch you.

230
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:25,873
I got cold as ice and Death standing there
grinning at me.

231
00:11:25,874 --> 00:11:29,418
- Troy, why don't you hush that talk.
- I say "What you want, Mr. Death?

232
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:32,738
You be wanting me? You done brought
your army to be getting me?"

233
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:35,123
I looked him dead in the eye.
I wasn't fearing nothing.

234
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:38,032
I was ready to tangle.
Just like I'm ready to tangle now.

235
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:39,970
The Bible say "be ever vigilant."

236
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:42,658
That's why I don't get but so drunk.
I got to keep watch.

237
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:45,762
Troy was right down there in Mercy Hospital.
You remember he had pneumonia?

238
00:11:45,763 --> 00:11:47,589
Laying there with a fever talking
plumb out of his head.

239
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,615
Death standing there staring at me
carrying that sickle in his hand.

240
00:11:50,616 --> 00:11:56,702
Finally he say,
"You want bound over for another year?"

241
00:11:56,703 --> 00:11:58,013
See, just like that.

242
00:11:58,014 --> 00:12:02,780
"You want bound over for another year?"

243
00:12:02,781 --> 00:12:06,552
I told him, "Bound over hell!
Let's settle this now!"

244
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:08,807
It seem like he kinda fell back when I said that

245
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:10,227
and all the cold went out of me.

246
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:12,382
I reached down and grabbed that sickle

247
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:15,789
and threw it just as far as I could throw it
and me and him commenced to wrestling.

248
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,414
We wrestled for... up to six,

249
00:12:18,415 --> 00:12:19,980
three days and three nights.

250
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:21,767
I can't say where I found the
strength from.

251
00:12:21,768 --> 00:12:23,640
Every time it seemed like he was gonna get
the best of me,

252
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:26,390
I'd reach way down deep inside myself

253
00:12:26,391 --> 00:12:27,886
and find the strength to do him one better.

254
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:30,801
Every time Troy tell that story,
he find different ways to tell it.

255
00:12:30,802 --> 00:12:32,569
Different things to make up about it.

256
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,550
I ain't making up woman.
I'm telling you the facts of what happened.

257
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:39,880
I wrestled with Death for three days and three nights
and I'm standing here to tell you about it.

258
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:44,699
All right. At the end of the third night

259
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,906
we done weakened each other to
where we can't hardly move.

260
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:49,702
Death stood up, throwed on his robe

261
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,579
had him a white robe with a hood on it.

262
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,078
He throwed on that robe and
went off to look for his sickle.

263
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:57,423
Say, "I'll be back." Just like that.

264
00:12:57,424 --> 00:12:58,763
"I'll be back."

265
00:12:58,764 --> 00:13:01,728
I told him, say, "Yeah, but you gonna
have to find me!" I wasn't no fool.

266
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:05,871
I wasn't no fool. I wasn't going looking for him.
Death ain't nothing to play with.

267
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:10,338
I know I got to join his army,
his camp followers.

268
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:13,473
But as long as I keep my strength and
see him coming

269
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:15,766
as long as I keep up my vigilance

270
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:17,558
he's gonna have to fight to get me.

271
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,073
I ain't going easy.

272
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:22,439
Well, look here, since you got to keep up
your vigilance

273
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,328
let me have the bottle.

274
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:27,642
Aw hell, I shouldn't have told you that part.
I should have left out that part.

275
00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:29,051
Troy be talking that stuff

276
00:13:29,052 --> 00:13:31,711
and half the time don't even know
what he be talking about.

277
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:34,096
- Bono know me better than that.
- That's right.

278
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:36,903
I know you. I know you got some
Uncle Remus in your blood.

279
00:13:36,904 --> 00:13:39,296
You got more stories than the devil got sinners.

280
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:41,896
Aw hell, I done seen him too!
Done talked with the devil.

281
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:47,618
Hey, Pop.

282
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,343
What you come "Hey, Popping" me for?

283
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:50,831
How you doing, Rose?

284
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:54,048
Mr. Bono. How you doing?

285
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:55,753
Hey, Lyons, how you been?

286
00:13:55,754 --> 00:13:58,441
He must have been doing all right. I ain't seen
him around here last week.

287
00:13:58,442 --> 00:14:01,629
Troy, leave your boy alone. He come by to see
you and you wanna start all that nonsense.

288
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,796
I ain't bothering Lyons. Here, get you a drink.
We got an understanding.

289
00:14:04,797 --> 00:14:08,038
I know why he come by to see me and
he know I know.

290
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:10,842
Come on, Pop. I just stopped by to say
hi, see how you was doing.

291
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:12,145
You ain't stopped by yesterday.

292
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:14,391
You gonna stay for supper, Lyons? I got some
chicken cooking in the oven.

293
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:17,818
No, Rose, thanks. I was just in the neighborhood
and thought I'd stop by for a minute.

294
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:20,807
You was in the neighborhood all right, nigger.
You telling the truth there.

295
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:22,640
You was in the neighborhood
'cause it's my payday.

296
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:25,390
Well, hell, since you mentioned it,
let me have ten dollars.

297
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:26,927
I'll be damned!

298
00:14:26,928 --> 00:14:28,752
I'll die and go to hell

299
00:14:28,753 --> 00:14:31,591
and play blackjack with the devil
before I give you ten dollars.

300
00:14:31,592 --> 00:14:34,373
That's what I want to know about that
devil you done seen.

301
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,669
Pop done seen the devil? You too much Pops.

302
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,857
Yeah, I done seen him. Talked to him too!

303
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:41,151
You ain't seen no devil. I done told you that
man ain't had nothing to do with the devil.

304
00:14:41,152 --> 00:14:43,414
Anything you can't understand,
you want to call it the devil.

305
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,639
Look here, Bono, I went down to see
Hertzberger about some furniture.

306
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,593
Got three rooms for 298.
That what it say on the radio.

307
00:14:49,594 --> 00:14:53,115
Three rooms 298. Even made up
a little song about it.

308
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:56,219
Go down there, man
tell me I can't get no credit.

309
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,567
I'm working every day and
can't get no credit.

310
00:14:58,568 --> 00:15:01,486
I got an empty house with some
raggedy furniture in it.

311
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:04,726
Cory ain't got no bed. He's sleeping on a pile of
rags on the floor.

312
00:15:04,727 --> 00:15:07,032
Working every day and can't get
no credit.

313
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:10,370
Come back here. Rose'll tell you madder than hell.
Sit down try to figure what I'm gonna do.

314
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:12,824
Come a knock on the door. Ain't been
living here but three days.

315
00:15:12,825 --> 00:15:14,174
Who know I'm here?

316
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,139
Open the door devil standing there
bigger than life.

317
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,561
White fellow, got on good clothes and everything.
Standing there with a clipboard in his hand.

318
00:15:20,562 --> 00:15:23,115
I ain't had to say nothing. First words
come out of his mouth was

319
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:26,255
"I understand you need some furniture
and can't get no credit."

320
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:27,562
I liked to fell over. He say,

321
00:15:27,563 --> 00:15:32,020
"I'll give you all the credit you want,
but you got to pay the interest on it."

322
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:34,814
I told him, "Give me three rooms' worth
and charge whatever you want."

323
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:38,402
Next day a truck pulled up here and
two men unloaded them three rooms.

324
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:40,758
Man what drove the truck give me a book.

325
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:44,194
Say send ten dollars, first of every month to the
address in the book

326
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:45,502
and everything will be all right.

327
00:15:45,503 --> 00:15:49,628
Say if I miss a payment the devil was
coming back and it'll be hell to pay.

328
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:52,550
That was fifteen years ago. To this day

329
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,146
the first of the month I send my ten dollars,

330
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:56,714
just like clockwork. Rose'll tell you.

331
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:59,371
- Troy lying.
- I ain't never seen that man since.

332
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:01,408
Now you tell me who else that could have been
but the devil?

333
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:04,563
I ain't sold my soul or nothing like that.
Naw, I wouldn't have truck with the devil

334
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,429
about nothing like that. But I got my furniture

335
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,017
and I send my ten dollars the
first of the month just like clockwork.

336
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:13,069
How long you say you been paying
this ten dollars a month?

337
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,067
- Fifteen years!
- Hell, ain't you finished paying for it yet?

338
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:18,016
How much the man done charged you?

339
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:21,157
Aw hell, I done paid for it. I done paid for it
ten times over!

340
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:23,406
- The fact is I'm scared to stop paying it.
- Troy lying.

341
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:25,143
We got that furniture from Mr. Glickman.

342
00:16:25,144 --> 00:16:26,847
He ain't paying no ten dollars a month
to nobody.

343
00:16:26,848 --> 00:16:29,318
Aw hell, woman. Bono know
I ain't that big a fool.

344
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:31,980
I was just getting ready to say. I know
where there's a bridge for sale.

345
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:34,825
I'll tell you this, it don't matter to me
if he was the devil.

346
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:37,315
It don't matter if the devil give credit.
Somebody got to give it.

347
00:16:37,316 --> 00:16:40,623
It ought to matter. You walking around here
saying you go making a truck with the devil

348
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,878
God's the one you gonna have to answer to.
He's the one gonna be at the Judgment.

349
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,911
Yeah, well, look here, Pop, let me have
that ten dollars. I'll give it back to you.

350
00:16:46,912 --> 00:16:48,750
Bonnie got a job working at the hospital.

351
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:50,690
What I tell you, Bono? The only time
I see this nigger is

352
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:53,127
when he wants something. That's the
only time I see him.

353
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:55,288
Come on, Pop, Mr. Bono don't want
to hear all that.

354
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:57,550
Let me have the ten dollars.
I told you Bonnie working.

355
00:16:57,551 --> 00:16:59,977
What that mean to me? "Bonnie working."
I don't care if she working.

356
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,193
Go ask her for the ten dollars
if she working.

357
00:17:02,194 --> 00:17:03,621
Talking about "Bonnie working."

358
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,074
Why ain't you working?

359
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:07,317
Aw, Pop, you know I can't find no decent job.

360
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,564
Where am I gonna get a job at?
You know I can't get no job.

361
00:17:09,565 --> 00:17:11,881
I told you I know some people down there.

362
00:17:11,882 --> 00:17:14,534
I can get you on the rubbish
if you want to work.

363
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,795
I told you that the last time you came by here
asking me for something.

364
00:17:16,796 --> 00:17:19,636
Naw, Pop thanks. That ain't for me.
I don't wanna be carrying nobody's rubbish.

365
00:17:19,637 --> 00:17:21,361
I don't want to be punching
nobody's time clock

366
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:23,670
What's the matter, you too good
to carry people's rubbish?

367
00:17:23,671 --> 00:17:25,634
Where you think that ten dollars
you talking about come from?

368
00:17:25,635 --> 00:17:27,358
I'm just supposed to haul people's rubbish
and give my money to you

369
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,326
'cause you too lazy to work.

370
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:32,201
You too lazy to work and wanna know
why you ain't got what I got.

371
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:35,892
- What hospital Bonnie working at? Mercy?
- She's down at Passavant working in the laundry.

372
00:17:35,893 --> 00:17:37,648
I ain't got nothing as it is.
I give you that ten dollars

373
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:39,120
and I got to eat beans the rest of the week.

374
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:40,965
Naw, you ain't getting no ten dollars here.

375
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:43,179
You ain't got to be eating no beans.
I don't know why you wanna say that.

376
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,228
I ain't got no extra money.

377
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:50,662
Gabe done moved out giving his money over there
to Miss Pearl's, paying her the rent,

378
00:17:50,663 --> 00:17:52,186
and things done got tight around here.

379
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:53,870
I can't afford to be giving you every payday.

380
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:56,655
I ain't asked you to give me nothing.
I asked you to loan me ten dollars.

381
00:17:56,656 --> 00:17:58,769
- I know you got ten dollars.
- Yeah, I got it.

382
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,140
You know why I got it? 'Cause I don't throw
my money away out there in the streets.

383
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:06,227
You living the fast life wanna be a musician
running around in them clubs and things

384
00:18:06,228 --> 00:18:07,752
then, you learn to take care of yourself.

385
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,331
You ain't gonna find me going and asking
nobody for nothing.

386
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,638
- I done spent too many years without.
- You and me is two different people, Pop.

387
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:17,103
I done learned my mistake and
learned to do what's right by it.

388
00:18:17,104 --> 00:18:20,063
You still trying to get something for nothing.
Life don't owe you nothing.

389
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:22,917
You owe it to yourself. Ask Bono.
He'll tell you I'm right.

390
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:25,356
You got your way of dealing with the world.
I got mine.

391
00:18:25,357 --> 00:18:27,258
The only thing that matters to me is
the music.

392
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:29,599
Yeah, I can see that! It don't matter
how you gonna eat

393
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,596
where your next dollar is coming from.
You telling the truth there.

394
00:18:32,597 --> 00:18:34,992
I know I got to eat. But I got to live too.

395
00:18:34,993 --> 00:18:37,258
I need something that gonna help me to get
out of the bed in the morning.

396
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:40,244
Make me feel like I belong in the world.
I don't bother nobody.

397
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:43,974
I just stay with my music 'cause that's the only
way I can find to live in the world.

398
00:18:43,975 --> 00:18:46,364
Otherwise there ain't no telling
what I might do.

399
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:49,438
Now I don't come criticizing you and how you live.

400
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:51,816
I just come by to ask you for ten dollars

401
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:53,784
I don't wanna hear all that about how I live!

402
00:18:53,785 --> 00:18:56,518
Boy, your mama did a hell of a job raising you.

403
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:59,518
You can't change me, Pop.
I'm thirty-four years old.

404
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:03,291
If you wanted to change me, you should have
been there when I was growing up.

405
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:04,967
I come by to see you

406
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:08,101
ask for ten dollars and you want to talk about
how I was raised.

407
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,324
You don't know nothing about how I was raised.

408
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:20,290
Let the boy have ten dollars, Troy.

409
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:26,009
What the hell you looking at me for?

410
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,171
I ain't got no ten dollars.
You know what I do with my money.

411
00:19:29,172 --> 00:19:31,485
Give him ten dollars if you want him to have it.

412
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:34,163
I will, as soon as you turn it loose.

413
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:38,993
There it is.

414
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:42,237
Seventy-six dollars and twenty-two cents.

415
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:45,258
You see this, Bono?
Now, I ain't gonna get but six of that back.

416
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:48,539
You ought to stop telling that lie. Here, Lyons.

417
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,973
Thanks, Rose.

418
00:19:54,637 --> 00:19:56,444
Look, I got to run. I'll see you later.

419
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,865
Wait a minute. You gonna say, "thanks, Rose,"

420
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,713
and ain't gonna look to see where
she got that ten dollars from?

421
00:20:00,714 --> 00:20:02,737
- See how they do me, Bono?
- I know she got it from you, Pop.

422
00:20:02,738 --> 00:20:05,166
- Thanks. I'll give it back to you.
- There he go telling another lie.

423
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:07,655
Time I see that ten dollars,
he'll be owing me thirty more.

424
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:09,763
- See you, Mr. Bono.
- Take care, Lyons!

425
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:12,821
Thanks, Pop. I'll see you again..

426
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:15,832
Why that boy going

427
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,421
get a decent job and take care
the woman he got.

428
00:20:18,422 --> 00:20:21,202
He'll be all right, Troy.
The boy is still young.

429
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:24,853
- The boy is thirty- four years old.
- Let's not get off into all that.

430
00:20:24,854 --> 00:20:27,732
Look here, I got to be going. I got to be
getting on. Lucille gonna be waiting.

431
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:29,444
See this woman, Bono?

432
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,195
I love this woman.

433
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:35,377
I love her so much it hurts.

434
00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:39,765
I love her so much,
I done run out of ways of loving her.

435
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:42,520
So I got to get back to basics.

436
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:45,292
Don't you come by my house Monday morning
talking about time to go to work

437
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:47,318
- 'cause I'm still gonna be stroking!
- Troy! Stop it now!

438
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:50,676
I ain't paying him no mind, Rose.
That ain't nothing but gin-talk.

439
00:20:50,677 --> 00:20:52,996
Go on, Troy. I'll see you Monday.

440
00:20:52,997 --> 00:20:54,814
Don't you come by my house, nigger!

441
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,406
I done told you what I'm gonna be doing.

442
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,059
Come back home Tuesday!

443
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:33,226
Jesus be a fence

444
00:21:33,227 --> 00:21:37,883
all around me every day

445
00:21:42,955 --> 00:21:44,620
Morning.

446
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,145
You ready for breakfast? I can fix it

447
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:49,363
as soon I finish hanging up these clothes.

448
00:21:49,364 --> 00:21:51,472
I got the coffee on. That's all right.

449
00:21:51,473 --> 00:21:54,694
I'll just have some of that this morning.

450
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,596
That 651 hit yesterday.

451
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:01,895
That's the second time this month.
Miss Pearl hit for a dollar.

452
00:22:01,896 --> 00:22:04,377
seem like those that need the least
always get lucky.

453
00:22:04,378 --> 00:22:07,142
- Poor folks can't get nothing.
- Them numbers don't know nobody.

454
00:22:07,143 --> 00:22:09,273
I don't know why you fool with them.
You and Lyons both.

455
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:10,752
It's something to do.

456
00:22:10,753 --> 00:22:13,033
You ain't doing nothing but
throwing your money away.

457
00:22:13,034 --> 00:22:16,588
Troy, you know I don't play foolishly. I just
play a nickel here and a nickel there.

458
00:22:16,589 --> 00:22:18,034
That's two nickels you done thrown away.

459
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:20,664
Now I hit sometimes that makes up for it.

460
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:23,715
It always come in handy when I do hit.
I don't hear you complaining then.

461
00:22:23,716 --> 00:22:25,692
I ain't complaining now. I just say it's foolish.

462
00:22:25,693 --> 00:22:28,553
Trying to guess out of six hundred ways which way
the number gonna come.

463
00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:31,084
If I had all the moneythese niggers

464
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:37,698
these Negroes, throw away on numbers for
one week,

465
00:22:37,699 --> 00:22:40,840
just one week, I'd be a rich man.

466
00:22:40,841 --> 00:22:42,465
Well, you wishing and calling it foolish

467
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:45,715
ain't gonna stop folks from playing numbers.
That's one thing for sure.

468
00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:49,262
Besides some good things come from playing
numbers.

469
00:22:49,263 --> 00:22:52,279
Look where Pope done bought him that
restaurant off of numbers.

470
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,656
I can't stand niggers like that.

471
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,566
Man ain't had two dimes to rub together.

472
00:22:57,567 --> 00:23:01,788
He run around with his shoes all run over
bumming money for cigarettes.

473
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:04,586
All right. Got lucky there and

474
00:23:04,587 --> 00:23:07,743
- Hit the numbers...
- Troy, I know all about it.

475
00:23:07,744 --> 00:23:09,452
Had good sense, I'll say that for him.
He ain't throwed his money away.

476
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:13,093
I seen niggers hit the numbers and go through
two thousand dollars in four days.

477
00:23:13,094 --> 00:23:17,607
Man built that restaurant down there
fixed it up real nice too

478
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:19,551
Then he won't let nobody come in it.

479
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:22,030
A Negro go in there and can't get no
kind of service.

480
00:23:22,031 --> 00:23:25,170
I seen a white fellow come in there
and order a bowl of stew.

481
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:27,837
Pope picked all the meat out the pot for him.

482
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:29,907
Man ain't had nothing but a bowl of meat!

483
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:33,984
Negro come behind him and ain't got nothing
but the potatoes and carrots.

484
00:23:33,985 --> 00:23:36,790
Talking about what numbers do for people,
you picked a wrong example.

485
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:40,763
Ain't done nothing but make a worser fool out of him
than he was before.

486
00:23:42,331 --> 00:23:44,195
Troy...

487
00:23:44,196 --> 00:23:47,260
you ought to stop worrying about what
happened at work yesterday.

488
00:23:49,232 --> 00:23:50,922
I ain't worried.

489
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,744
Just called me down there at the
commissioner's office on Friday.

490
00:23:54,745 --> 00:23:57,350
Everybody worried about firing me.

491
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:59,504
I ain't worried about them firing me.

492
00:23:59,949 --> 00:24:01,756
You ain't got to worry about that.

493
00:24:02,686 --> 00:24:04,572
Where's Cory? Cory in the house?

494
00:24:07,836 --> 00:24:10,163
He gone out.

495
00:24:10,164 --> 00:24:12,364
Out, huh? He gone out

496
00:24:12,365 --> 00:24:15,326
'cause he know I want him
to work on this fence.

497
00:24:15,327 --> 00:24:18,710
I know how he is. That boy scared of work.
He ain't done a lick of work in his life.

498
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:20,245
He had to go to football practice.

499
00:24:20,246 --> 00:24:23,487
Coach wanted them to get in a little extra practice
before the season start.

500
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:25,357
I got his practice allright.

501
00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:27,661
running out of here before
he get his chores done.

502
00:24:27,662 --> 00:24:30,650
Troy, what is wrong with you this morning?
Don't nothing set right with you.

503
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:33,202
Go on back in there and go to bed
get up on the other side.

504
00:24:33,203 --> 00:24:35,578
Why something got to be wrong with me?
I ain't said nothing wrong with me.

505
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:37,160
You got something to say about everything.

506
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:39,430
First it's the numbers then it's the way the man
runs his restaurant

507
00:24:39,431 --> 00:24:42,375
then you done got on Cory.
What's it gonna be next?

508
00:24:42,376 --> 00:24:44,502
Take a look up there and see
if the weather suits you

509
00:24:44,503 --> 00:24:47,607
or is it gonna be how you gonna put up the fence
with the clothes hanging in the yard.

510
00:24:47,608 --> 00:24:49,274
You hit the nail on the head then.

511
00:24:49,275 --> 00:24:51,522
I know you like I know the back of my hand.

512
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,575
Come on in here and get you some more coffee

513
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:56,731
see if that straighten you up.
'Cause you ain't right this morning.

514
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,073
So...

515
00:25:16,796 --> 00:25:18,418
Plums!

516
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:20,996
Three for $0.25.

517
00:25:21,732 --> 00:25:23,514
Come and buy now!

518
00:25:23,515 --> 00:25:25,578
'Cause I'm here today

519
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:28,774
and tomorrow I'm leaving!

520
00:25:28,775 --> 00:25:33,078
Ask me how I sell $0.10 each

521
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,894
or three for $0.25.

522
00:25:34,895 --> 00:25:36,725
Come and buy now!

523
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:44,801
'Cause I'm here today and tomorrow
I'll be gone.

524
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:46,309
Look Troy.

525
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,750
Hey, Troy!

526
00:25:49,076 --> 00:25:50,647
Hey, Gabe.

527
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,761
- Hey, Rose!
- Hey, Gabe? What you got there?

528
00:25:57,762 --> 00:26:00,863
You know what I got, Rose.
I got fruits and vegetables.

529
00:26:00,864 --> 00:26:02,440
Where's all these plums you talking about?

530
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:04,754
I ain't got no plums today, Rose.

531
00:26:04,755 --> 00:26:07,708
I was just singing that. Have some tomorrow.

532
00:26:07,709 --> 00:26:10,267
Put me in a big order for plums.

533
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:14,545
Have enough plums tomorrow for
Saint Peter and everybody.

534
00:26:15,146 --> 00:26:17,034
Troy's mad at me.

535
00:26:17,758 --> 00:26:20,289
I ain't mad at you. What I got to be mad at you
about?

536
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,615
You ain't done nothing to me.

537
00:26:21,616 --> 00:26:26,031
I just moved over to Miss Pearl's to keep
out from in your way.

538
00:26:26,032 --> 00:26:27,616
I ain't mean no harm by it.

539
00:26:27,617 --> 00:26:30,231
Who said anything about that?
I ain't said anything about that.

540
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,284
You ain't mad at me, is you?

541
00:26:33,285 --> 00:26:36,892
Naw I ain't mad at you, Gabe. If I was mad
at you I'd tell you about it.

542
00:26:37,955 --> 00:26:39,589
Come on, get on out the street.

543
00:26:40,062 --> 00:26:41,494
Come on.

544
00:26:44,343 --> 00:26:46,840
Got me two rooms. In the basement.

545
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:49,996
Got my own door too. Wanna see my key?

546
00:26:52,198 --> 00:26:55,963
That's my own key! Ain't nobody else
got a key like that.

547
00:26:55,964 --> 00:26:57,960
That's my key! My two rooms.

548
00:26:57,961 --> 00:27:00,231
Well, that's good, Gabe. You got your own
key, that's good.

549
00:27:00,232 --> 00:27:03,273
You hungry, Gabe? I was just fixing to cook Troy
his breakfast.

550
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:06,092
I'll take some biscuits.
You got some biscuits?

551
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:09,724
Did you know when I was in Heaven

552
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:12,865
every morning me and Saint Peter would sit down
by the Gate and eat some

553
00:27:12,866 --> 00:27:15,552
big fat biscuits?

554
00:27:15,553 --> 00:27:18,166
Oh, yeah! We had us a good time.

555
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:20,637
We'd sit
there and eat us them biscuits

556
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:24,505
and then Saint Peter would go off to sleep
and tell me to wake him up

557
00:27:24,506 --> 00:27:26,799
when it's time to open the Gates for the Judg-
ment.

558
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,744
Well, come on, I'll make up a batch of biscuits.

559
00:27:31,106 --> 00:27:34,583
Troy, Saint Peter got your name in the
book.

560
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:37,601
I seen it. It say Troy Maxson.

561
00:27:37,602 --> 00:27:42,275
I say I know him! He got the same name like
what I got.

562
00:27:42,782 --> 00:27:45,030
That's my brother!

563
00:27:46,384 --> 00:27:48,720
How many times you gonna tell me that, Gabe?

564
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:52,047
Ain't got my name in the book.
Don't have to have my name.

565
00:27:52,048 --> 00:27:54,189
I done died and went to Heaven.

566
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,137
He got your name though.

567
00:27:57,138 --> 00:28:00,674
One morning Saint Peter was
looking at his book

568
00:28:00,675 --> 00:28:03,417
marking it up for the Judgment

569
00:28:03,418 --> 00:28:08,109
and let me see your name. Got it
in there under M.

570
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:12,311
Got Rose's name. I ain't
seen it like I seen yours

571
00:28:12,312 --> 00:28:14,139
but I know it's in
there.

572
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,545
He got a great big book.

573
00:28:17,284 --> 00:28:20,296
Got every body's name what was
ever been born.

574
00:28:20,297 --> 00:28:21,804
That's what he told me.

575
00:28:21,805 --> 00:28:25,700
But I seen your name.
Seen it with my own eyes.

576
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:28,192
Go on in the house there. Rose going to fix you
something to eat.

577
00:28:28,193 --> 00:28:33,140
Oh, I ain't hungry. I done had breakfast with
Aunt Jemimah.

578
00:28:33,528 --> 00:28:37,640
She come by and cooked me up a whole
mess of flapjacks.

579
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:40,396
- Go on in the house there. Rose going to fix you something to eat.
- Remember how we used to eat them flapjacks?

580
00:28:40,397 --> 00:28:42,502
- Yes, I remember. Come on now.
- I got to go, I got to go.

581
00:28:42,503 --> 00:28:47,042
- Gabe, come on!
- I got to go sell my plums.

582
00:28:47,043 --> 00:28:51,473
I done sold some tomatoes.
Got me two quarters. Wanna see?

583
00:28:51,474 --> 00:28:54,034
I'm gonna save them and buy me a new horn

584
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:57,550
so Saint Peter can hear me
when it's time to open the Gates.

585
00:28:58,763 --> 00:29:00,317
Hear that?

586
00:29:02,389 --> 00:29:04,083
Hear that?

587
00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:05,602
That's the hellhounds.

588
00:29:05,603 --> 00:29:07,411
I got to chase them out of here.

589
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,680
Go on get out of here!
Get out!

590
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:16,814
Well, all you hypocrite members,

591
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:19,297
You wasting your time away.

592
00:29:19,298 --> 00:29:22,259
My God's calling for workmens

593
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,282
And you had better obey.

594
00:29:24,283 --> 00:29:34,801
Better get ready for judgment!

595
00:29:34,802 --> 00:29:38,145
My God is coming

596
00:29:40,122 --> 00:29:43,568
Better get ready for judgment!

597
00:29:44,101 --> 00:29:50,677
Better get ready for judgment!

598
00:29:50,678 --> 00:29:54,301
My God is coming

599
00:29:54,302 --> 00:29:57,374
Better get ready for judgment!

600
00:29:58,107 --> 00:30:01,331
Better get ready for judgment!

601
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:04,223
My God is coming

602
00:30:09,151 --> 00:30:10,676
Where's Gabe?

603
00:30:11,387 --> 00:30:13,164
He gone off somewhere.

604
00:30:15,788 --> 00:30:17,113
He ain't eating right.

605
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:18,988
Miss Pearl say she can't
get him to eat nothing.

606
00:30:18,989 --> 00:30:20,557
What you want me to do about it, Rose?

607
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:23,210
I done did everything I can for the man.
I can't make him get well.

608
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:26,525
Man got half his head blown away
what you expect?

609
00:30:26,853 --> 00:30:29,089
Seem like something ought to be done to help him.

610
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,908
Man don't bother nobody.

611
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:32,709
He just mixed up from that metal plate

612
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,894
he got in his head. Ain't no sense...

613
00:30:35,474 --> 00:30:38,700
Ain't no sense to send him to the hospital.

614
00:30:38,701 --> 00:30:41,776
Least he be eating right. They can help
him take care of himself.

615
00:30:41,777 --> 00:30:44,990
Don't nobody wanna be locked up, Rose.
What you wanna lock the man up for?

616
00:30:44,991 --> 00:30:46,918
Man go down there

617
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,857
and fight the war messin' around
with them Japs,

618
00:30:51,396 --> 00:30:52,955
get
half his head blown off

619
00:30:52,956 --> 00:30:56,561
and they give him a lousy three thousand dollars.
And I had to swoop down on that.

620
00:30:56,562 --> 00:30:59,854
- Is you fixing to go into that again?
- He got a metal plate in his head

621
00:30:59,855 --> 00:31:03,986
That's the only way I got a roof over
my head 'cause of that metal plate.

622
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,341
Ain't no sense you blaming yourself for nothing.

623
00:31:06,342 --> 00:31:08,316
Gabe wasn't in no condition to manage that money.

624
00:31:08,317 --> 00:31:11,466
You done what was right by him. Can't nobody say
you ain't done what was right by him.

625
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:13,102
Look how long you took care of him

626
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:15,840
till he wanted to have his own place
and moved over there with Miss Pearl.

627
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:18,125
That ain't what I'm saying, woman!
I'm just...

628
00:31:20,355 --> 00:31:22,436
just stating the facts.

629
00:31:22,437 --> 00:31:24,635
If my brother didn't have that
metal plate in his head

630
00:31:24,636 --> 00:31:29,116
I wouldn't have a pot to piss in or a window
to throw it out of. And I'm fifty-three

631
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:40,560
Where you going off to?

632
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:44,406
You been running out of here every Saturday for weeks.
I thought you was gonna work on this fence?

633
00:31:45,353 --> 00:31:48,645
I'm gonna walk down to Taylors' and...

634
00:32:37,598 --> 00:32:38,899
Mama?

635
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:42,599
Cory, Your daddy like to had a fit
with you running out

636
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,242
of here this morning without doing your chores.

637
00:32:45,243 --> 00:32:46,647
You all right?

638
00:32:46,648 --> 00:32:49,230
He say you were supposed
to help him with the fence.

639
00:32:49,871 --> 00:32:51,580
I told you I had to go to practice.

640
00:32:51,581 --> 00:32:56,484
He been saying that the last four or five Saturdays,
and then he don't never do nothing, but go down to Taylors'

641
00:32:57,925 --> 00:33:00,901
- Did you tell him about the recruiter?
- Yeah, I told him.

642
00:33:00,902 --> 00:33:03,205
- What did he say?
- He ain't said nothing too much.

643
00:33:03,206 --> 00:33:05,921
You get up there and get started
on your chores before he gets back.

644
00:33:05,922 --> 00:33:08,340
Go on and scrub down them steps

645
00:33:08,341 --> 00:33:11,516
before he gets back here hollering
and carrying on.

646
00:33:11,517 --> 00:33:13,133
Go, boy, go!

647
00:33:36,207 --> 00:33:39,139
Go on, Troy! You liked to scared me to death.

648
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,483
What was the score of the game?

649
00:33:40,484 --> 00:33:42,459
Lucille had me on the phone and
I couldn't keep up with it.

650
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,076
What I care about the game?
Come here, woman.

651
00:33:44,077 --> 00:33:47,150
I thought you went down Taylors' to listen to
the game. Go on, Troy!

652
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:48,865
You supposed to be putting up the fence.

653
00:33:48,866 --> 00:33:51,727
I'll put it up when I finish with what...

654
00:33:52,443 --> 00:33:54,802
- is at hand.
- Go on, Troy. I ain't studying you.

655
00:33:54,803 --> 00:33:59,079
I'm studying you, I'm fended do my homework!

656
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,074
Troy, you better leave me alone.

657
00:34:02,977 --> 00:34:05,260
Where's Cory?
That boy brought his butt home yet?

658
00:34:05,261 --> 00:34:06,673
He's upstairs doing his chores.

659
00:34:06,674 --> 00:34:08,153
Cory! Get your butt...!

660
00:34:09,151 --> 00:34:11,579
- Where you going?
- I'll be right back.

661
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,376
- When...?
- I'm just going right down the street.

662
00:34:14,377 --> 00:34:15,768
Where?

663
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,040
Who?

664
00:34:21,165 --> 00:34:23,180
Troy, go in the House!

665
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:53,564
- You just now coming in here from leaving this morning?
- Yeah, I had to go to football practice.

666
00:34:53,565 --> 00:34:54,898
- Yeah, what?
- Yessir.

667
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:56,928
I ain't but two seconds off you noway.

668
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,648
The garbage sitting in there overflowing

669
00:34:58,649 --> 00:35:01,254
you ain't done none of your chores and
you come in here talking about, "Yeah."

670
00:35:01,255 --> 00:35:02,575
I was just getting ready to do my chores now,
Pop

671
00:35:02,576 --> 00:35:06,231
Your first chore is to help me with this fence
on Saturday. Everything else come after that.

672
00:35:06,232 --> 00:35:08,734
Now get that saw and cut them boards.

673
00:35:12,726 --> 00:35:14,064
Hey, Pop

674
00:35:14,065 --> 00:35:15,823
why don't you buy a TV?

675
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:18,191
What I want with a TV?
What I want one of them for?

676
00:35:18,192 --> 00:35:21,613
Everybody got one. Earl, Ba Bra, Jesse!

677
00:35:21,614 --> 00:35:23,864
I ain't asked you who had one.
I say what I want with one?

678
00:35:23,865 --> 00:35:27,269
So you can watch it. They got lots of things on
TV. Baseball games and everything.

679
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,945
- Yeah?
- We could watch the World Series.

680
00:35:28,946 --> 00:35:30,604
Yeah. And how much this TV cost?

681
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:33,149
I don't know. They got them on sale for around
two hundred dollars.

682
00:35:33,555 --> 00:35:35,696
- Two hundred dollars, huh?
- That ain't that much, Pop.

683
00:35:35,697 --> 00:35:37,456
Naw, it's just two hundred dollars.

684
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,433
See that roof you got over your head at night?

685
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:43,203
Let me tell you something about that roof.

686
00:35:43,204 --> 00:35:47,641
It's been ten years since
that roof was last tarred.

687
00:35:47,642 --> 00:35:51,020
See now, the snow come this winter
and sit up there on that roof like it is

688
00:35:51,021 --> 00:35:54,105
and it's gonna seep inside. It's just gonna be a little bit
ain't gonna hardly notice it.

689
00:35:54,106 --> 00:35:56,782
Then the next thing you know,
it's gonna be leaking all over the house.

690
00:35:56,783 --> 00:36:00,613
Then the wood rot from all that
water and you gonna need a whole new roof.

691
00:36:00,614 --> 00:36:02,986
Now, how much you think it cost
to get that roof tarred?

692
00:36:02,987 --> 00:36:07,530
- I don't know.
- Two hundred and sixty-four dollars, cash money.

693
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:10,754
While you thinking about a TV, I got to be
thinking about the roof

694
00:36:10,755 --> 00:36:12,606
and whatever else go wrong around here.

695
00:36:13,391 --> 00:36:15,617
Now if you had two hundred dollars, what would you do

696
00:36:15,618 --> 00:36:17,537
fix the roof or buy a TV?

697
00:36:17,538 --> 00:36:19,018
I'd buy a TV.

698
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:22,037
Then when the roof started to leak
when it needed fixing, I'd fix it.

699
00:36:22,038 --> 00:36:24,671
Where are you gonna get the money from?
You done spent it for a TV.

700
00:36:24,672 --> 00:36:28,156
You gonna sit up and watch the
water run all over your brand-new TV.

701
00:36:28,157 --> 00:36:29,788
Aw, Pop. You got money. I know you do.

702
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:31,532
- Where I got it at, huh?
- You got it in the bank.

703
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:36,003
You wanna see my bankbook? You wanna see that
$73.22 I got sitting up in there?

704
00:36:36,004 --> 00:36:39,402
You ain't got to pay for it all at one time. You can
put a down payment on it and carry it home with you.

705
00:36:39,403 --> 00:36:42,246
Not me. I ain't gonna owe nobody nothing
if I can help it.

706
00:36:42,247 --> 00:36:45,757
Miss a payment and they come and snatch it
right out your house. Then what you got?

707
00:36:47,107 --> 00:36:50,139
Now, when I get two hundred dollars clear,

708
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,980
then I'll buy me a TV.

709
00:36:51,981 --> 00:36:56,010
Right now, as soon as I get 264 dollars, 
I'm gonna have this roof tarred.- Aw, Pop!

710
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:59,101
You go on and get you two hundred dollars and
buy one if ya want it.

711
00:36:59,102 --> 00:37:00,749
I got better things to do with my money.

712
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,185
I can't get no two hundred dollars.
I ain't never seen two hundred dollars.

713
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:04,781
II'll tell you what...

714
00:37:04,782 --> 00:37:07,930
you get a hundred dollars and
I'll put the other hundred with it.

715
00:37:07,931 --> 00:37:09,536
All right, I'm gonna show you.

716
00:37:09,537 --> 00:37:12,387
You gonna show me how you can cut
them boards right now.

717
00:37:13,137 --> 00:37:14,581
Here you go.

718
00:37:14,582 --> 00:37:16,430
200 dollars worth.

719
00:37:18,388 --> 00:37:20,671
The Pirates won today.

720
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:23,157
- That makes five in a row.
- I ain't thinking about the Pirates.

721
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,735
Got an all white team.
Got that boy

722
00:37:25,736 --> 00:37:27,547
that Puerto Rican boy, Clemente.

723
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:31,482
Don't even half-play him. That boy could be something
if they give him a chance.

724
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:33,559
Play him one day and sit him on the bench
the next.

725
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,948
He gets a lot of chances to play.

726
00:37:34,949 --> 00:37:38,651
I'm talking about playing regular. Playing every day.
so you can get your timing.That's what I'm talking about.

727
00:37:38,652 --> 00:37:40,612
They got some white guys on the team
that don't play every day.

728
00:37:40,613 --> 00:37:42,221
You can't play everybody at the same time.

729
00:37:42,222 --> 00:37:46,231
If they got a white fellow sitting on the bench,
you can bet your last dollar he can't play!

730
00:37:46,232 --> 00:37:48,838
The colored guy got to be twice as good
before he get on the team.

731
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,660
That's why I don't want you to get
all tied up in them sports.

732
00:37:51,661 --> 00:37:53,657
Man on the team and what it get him?

733
00:37:53,658 --> 00:37:56,046
They got colored on the team
and don't use them.

734
00:37:56,047 --> 00:37:57,471
Same as not having them.

735
00:37:57,472 --> 00:37:59,118
All them teams the same.

736
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,125
The Braves got Hank Aaron and Wes Covington.

737
00:38:01,126 --> 00:38:03,081
Hank Aaron hit two home runs today.
That makes forty- three.

738
00:38:03,082 --> 00:38:05,723
Hank Aaron ain't nobody.
That's what you supposed to do.

739
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:08,663
That's how you supposed to play the game.
Ain't nothing to it.

740
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:12,152
It's just a matter of timing getting the right follow-through.
Hell, I can hit forty-three home runs right now!

741
00:38:12,153 --> 00:38:13,461
Not off no major-league pitching, you couldn't.

742
00:38:13,462 --> 00:38:15,419
We had better pitching in the Negro leagues.

743
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,432
I hit seven home runs off of Satchel Paige.
You can't get no better than that!

744
00:38:18,433 --> 00:38:20,047
Sandy Koufax. He's leading the league in strike-outs.

745
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,819
I ain't thinking of no Sandy Koufax.

746
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,479
You got Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette...

747
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,165
I'm through with it now.

748
00:38:28,946 --> 00:38:30,775
You go on and cut them boards.

749
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:37,873
Your mama tell me you done got recruited by a
college football team? Is that right?

750
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:41,716
Yeah. Coach Zellman say the recruiter gonna be
coming by to talk to you.

751
00:38:41,717 --> 00:38:43,686
Get you to sign the permission papers.

752
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:47,235
I thought you supposed to be working down there at the A&P.
Ain't you supposed to be working down there after school?

753
00:38:47,236 --> 00:38:48,663
Mr. Stawicki say he gonna

754
00:38:48,664 --> 00:38:50,754
hold my job for me until after the football season.

755
00:38:50,755 --> 00:38:53,397
Say starting next week I can work weekends.

756
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:56,415
I thought we had an understanding
about this football stuff?

757
00:38:56,416 --> 00:39:00,005
You suppose to keep up with your chores and
hold that job down at the A&P.

758
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:02,392
Ain't been around here all day on a Saturday.

759
00:39:02,393 --> 00:39:05,476
Ain't none of your chores done and now you
telling me you done quit your job.

760
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,593
- I'm gonna be working weekends.
- You damn right you are!

761
00:39:07,594 --> 00:39:10,968
And ain't no need for nobody coming around here
to talk to me about signing nothing.

762
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:12,931
Hey, Pop, you can't do that. He's coming
all the way from North Carolina.

763
00:39:12,932 --> 00:39:15,062
I don't care where he coming from.

764
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:16,610
Look, boy.

765
00:39:17,242 --> 00:39:21,105
The white man ain't gonna let you get nowhere
with that football no way.

766
00:39:21,106 --> 00:39:23,165
You go on and get your book-learning
so you can...

767
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:25,028
work yourself up in that A&P

768
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,536
or learn how to fix cars or build houses
or something,

769
00:39:27,537 --> 00:39:30,532
get you a trade. That way you have something can't
nobody take away from you.

770
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:32,901
You go on and learn how to put
your hands to some good use.

771
00:39:32,902 --> 00:39:35,425
Besides hauling people's garbage.

772
00:39:35,426 --> 00:39:38,101
I get good grades, Pop. That's why the recruiter
wants to talk with you.

773
00:39:38,102 --> 00:39:39,703
You got to keep up your
grades to get recruited.

774
00:39:39,704 --> 00:39:41,606
This way I'll be going to college.
I'll get a chance

775
00:39:41,607 --> 00:39:45,009
First you gonna get your butt down there to the
A&P and get your job back.

776
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,018
Mr. Stawicki done already hired somebody else
'cause I told him I was playing football.

777
00:39:49,246 --> 00:39:51,355
You a bigger fool than I thought

778
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:55,313
to let somebody take away your job
so you can play some football.

779
00:39:55,947 --> 00:39:58,504
Where you gonna get your money to take
out your girlfriend and whatnot?

780
00:39:58,505 --> 00:40:01,494
What kind of foolishness is that to let
somebody take away your job?

781
00:40:01,495 --> 00:40:03,296
- I'm still gonna be working weekends.
- Naw, naw.

782
00:40:03,297 --> 00:40:04,764
You getting your butt out of here
and finding you another job.

783
00:40:04,765 --> 00:40:08,131
Come on, Pop! I got to practice. I can't work
after school and play football too.

784
00:40:08,132 --> 00:40:09,619
The team needs me. That's what Coach Zellman say.

785
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,930
I don't care what nobody else say.
I'm the boss you understand?

786
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:15,399
I'm the boss around here. I do the only saying what counts.
- Come on, Pop!

787
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,791
- I asked you. Do you understand?

788
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,460
- Yes.
- What?!

789
00:40:20,538 --> 00:40:22,029
Yessir.

790
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:24,416
All right.

791
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:27,087
You go down to A & P, see if you can get your job back.

792
00:40:27,088 --> 00:40:29,729
If you can do both, then you could do
the football team

793
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,123
You gotta take the crookeds with the straights.

794
00:40:32,124 --> 00:40:33,526
Yessir.

795
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,213
Can I ask you a question?

796
00:40:42,771 --> 00:40:46,090
What the hell you wanna ask me? Mr. Stawicki the
one you got the questions for.

797
00:40:47,036 --> 00:40:48,855
How come you ain't never liked me?

798
00:40:49,499 --> 00:40:50,847
Liked you?

799
00:40:51,471 --> 00:40:53,955
Who the hell say I got to like you?

800
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:57,535
What law is there say I got to like you?

801
00:40:57,536 --> 00:41:00,922
Wanna stand up in my face and ask a damn
fool-ass question like that.

802
00:41:00,923 --> 00:41:03,819
Talking about liking somebody.
Come here, boy, when I talk to you.

803
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,273
Straighten up, goddamn it!

804
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:10,239
I asked you a question.

805
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,870
what law is there say I got to like you?

806
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:14,602
- None.
- Well, all right then!

807
00:41:14,603 --> 00:41:15,944
Don't you eat every day?

808
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:19,009
Answer me when I talk to you!
Don't you eat every day?

809
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,280
- Yeah.
- Nigger, as long as you in my house,

810
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:23,537
- you put that sir on the end of it when you talk to me!
- Yes, sir.

811
00:41:23,538 --> 00:41:24,838
- You eat every day.
- Yessir!

812
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:26,139
- Got a roof over your head.
- Yessir!

813
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,440
- Got clothes on your back.
- Yessir.

814
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:29,015
- Why you think that is?
- 'Cause of you.

815
00:41:29,016 --> 00:41:31,284
Aw, hell, I know it's 'cause of me

816
00:41:31,285 --> 00:41:33,275
but why do you think that is?

817
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:36,283
'Cause you like me.

818
00:41:36,673 --> 00:41:38,200
Like you?

819
00:41:38,547 --> 00:41:40,456
I go out of here every morning

820
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:43,950
bust my butt putting up with them crackers
every day

821
00:41:43,951 --> 00:41:45,665
'cause I like you?

822
00:41:45,666 --> 00:41:47,748
You about the biggest fool I ever saw.

823
00:41:47,749 --> 00:41:50,768
It's my job. It's my responsibility!

824
00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:53,814
A man is supposed to take care of his family.

825
00:41:53,815 --> 00:41:56,769
You live in my house,
fill you belly up with my food,

826
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:59,941
put your behind on my bed,
because you are my son.

827
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:03,442
Not 'cause I like you!
'Cause it's my duty to take care of you.

828
00:42:03,443 --> 00:42:05,754
I owe a responsibility to you!

829
00:42:05,755 --> 00:42:09,669
Let's get this straight right here,
before it go along any further

830
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,316
I ain't got to like you.

831
00:42:11,317 --> 00:42:14,337
Mr. Rand don't give me my money come payday
'cause he likes me.

832
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:16,562
He give it to me, 'cause he owe me.

833
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:19,670
I done give you everything I got to give you.

834
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:21,428
I gave you your life!

835
00:42:21,846 --> 00:42:23,736
Me and your mama worked that out between us.

836
00:42:23,737 --> 00:42:26,482
And liking your black ass wasn't part
of the bargain.

837
00:42:26,917 --> 00:42:30,757
Don't you try and go through life worrying about
if somebody like you or not.

838
00:42:30,758 --> 00:42:33,746
You best be making sure they doing right by you.

839
00:42:33,747 --> 00:42:35,406
- You understand what I'm saying, boy?
- Yessir.

840
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:39,079
Then get the hell out of my face, and get on
down to that A&P.

841
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:04,804
Why don't you let the boy go ahead
and play football, Troy?

842
00:43:04,805 --> 00:43:06,750
He just want to be like you with the sports.

843
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,459
I don't want him to be like me!

844
00:43:08,888 --> 00:43:11,876
I want him to move as far away from my life
as possibly he can get.

845
00:43:11,877 --> 00:43:14,164
You the only decent thing that
ever happened to me.

846
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:15,968
I wish him that.

847
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:18,756
But I don't wish him nothing else
from my life.

848
00:43:20,353 --> 00:43:24,623
I decided seventeen years ago that boy wasn't
getting involved in no sports.

849
00:43:24,624 --> 00:43:26,385
Not after what they did to me in the sports.

850
00:43:26,386 --> 00:43:28,896
Troy, why don't you admit you was too old to
play in the major leagues?

851
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,256
For once, why don't you admit that?

852
00:43:30,257 --> 00:43:32,169
Don't come telling me, I was too old.

853
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:33,980
I just wasn't the right color.

854
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:38,678
I'm fifty-three years old and can do better
than Selkirk's .269 right now!

855
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:41,152
How's was you gonna play ball
when you were over forty?

856
00:43:41,153 --> 00:43:42,891
Sometimes I can't get no sense out of you.

857
00:43:42,892 --> 00:43:44,900
I got good sense, woman. I got sense enough

858
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:47,237
not to let that boy get hurt over
playing no sports.

859
00:43:47,238 --> 00:43:48,985
You're mothering that boy too much.

860
00:43:48,986 --> 00:43:51,514
Worried about if people like him or not.

861
00:43:51,515 --> 00:43:54,025
Everything that boy do, he do for you.

862
00:43:54,556 --> 00:43:57,473
He wants you to say, "Good job, son."
That's all.

863
00:43:57,474 --> 00:43:59,141
I ain't got time for that. Rose.

864
00:43:59,142 --> 00:44:00,748
He's alive.
He's healthy.

865
00:44:00,749 --> 00:44:03,368
He's got to make his own way. I made mine.

866
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:06,914
Ain't nobody gonna hold his hand
when he get out there in that world.

867
00:44:06,915 --> 00:44:08,545
Times have changed from when you was young,
Troy.

868
00:44:09,285 --> 00:44:10,963
People change.

869
00:44:11,462 --> 00:44:14,064
The world's changing around you
and you can't even see it.

870
00:44:20,066 --> 00:44:22,297
Woman, I do the best I can do.

871
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:27,242
I come in here every Friday. I carry a sack of
potatoes and a bucket of lard.

872
00:44:27,243 --> 00:44:29,675
You all line up at the door with your hands out.

873
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:34,891
I give you the lint from my pockets.
I give you my sweat and my blood.

874
00:44:34,892 --> 00:44:37,004
I ain't got no tears. I done spent them.

875
00:44:37,005 --> 00:44:40,251
We go upstairs in that room at night
and I fall down on you

876
00:44:40,252 --> 00:44:42,584
and try to blast a hole into forever.

877
00:44:43,659 --> 00:44:47,600
I get up Monday morning find my lunch on the table.
I go out. Make my way.

878
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:50,307
Find my strength to carry me
through to the next Friday.

879
00:44:52,061 --> 00:44:53,872
That's all I got, Rose.

880
00:44:56,209 --> 00:44:59,481
All I got to give.

881
00:45:03,141 --> 00:45:05,429
I can't give nothing
else!

882
00:45:31,733 --> 00:45:33,448
Mr. Maxson?

883
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:38,001
The commissioner will see you now.

884
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:46,529
Rose!

885
00:45:49,482 --> 00:45:51,373
Hey, Rose!

886
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:55,360
I wish I could have seen Mr. Rand's face
when he told you.

887
00:45:55,361 --> 00:45:58,361
He couldn't get it out of his mouth!
Liked to bit his tongue!

888
00:45:58,362 --> 00:46:02,131
When they called me down there to the commissioner's office
he thought they was gonna fire me.

889
00:46:02,132 --> 00:46:05,215
- Like everybody else.
- I didn't think they was gonna fire you.

890
00:46:05,216 --> 00:46:07,198
I thought they was gonna put you on
the warning paper.

891
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:08,702
Hey, Rose!

892
00:46:08,703 --> 00:46:10,932
Yeah, Mr. Rand like to bit his tongue.

893
00:46:10,933 --> 00:46:14,438
I see you run right down to Taylors'
and told that Alberta gal.

894
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:16,343
Hey, Rose! I told everybody.

895
00:46:16,344 --> 00:46:17,922
Hey, Rose!

896
00:46:17,923 --> 00:46:19,845
I went down there to cash my check.

897
00:46:21,757 --> 00:46:25,369
Hush all that hollering, man! I know you out here.
What they say down there at the commissioner's office?

898
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,321
You supposed to come when I call you, woman.

899
00:46:27,322 --> 00:46:29,786
Bono'll tell you that.
Don't Lucille come when you call her?

900
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,805
Man, hush your mouth. I ain't no dog talk about
"come when you call me."

901
00:46:32,806 --> 00:46:35,990
You hear this, Bono? I had me an old dog
used to get uppity like that. You say,

902
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:38,080
"C'mere, Blue!" and he just lay there
and look at you.

903
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:40,305
End up getting a stick and chasing him away
trying to make him come.

904
00:46:40,306 --> 00:46:42,394
I ain't studying you and your dog.

905
00:46:42,395 --> 00:46:43,851
I remember you used to sing that old song.

906
00:46:43,852 --> 00:46:46,024
Hear it ring! Hear it ring!

907
00:46:46,025 --> 00:46:47,811
Had an old dog his name was Blue.

908
00:46:47,812 --> 00:46:49,628
Don't nobody want to hear you sing
that old song.

909
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,073
You know Blue was mighty true.

910
00:46:52,074 --> 00:46:54,417
Used to have Cory running around here
singing that song.

911
00:46:54,418 --> 00:46:56,179
Hell, I remember that song myself.

912
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,743
You know Blue was a good old dog.

913
00:46:58,744 --> 00:47:01,183
Blue treed a possum in a hollow log.

914
00:47:01,184 --> 00:47:03,744
That was my daddy's song.
My daddy made up that song.

915
00:47:03,745 --> 00:47:06,449
I don't care who made it up.
Don't nobody wanna hear you sing it.

916
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:08,863
Come here, woman.

917
00:47:08,864 --> 00:47:11,267
You come in here carrying on,
I reckon they ain't fired you.

918
00:47:11,776 --> 00:47:13,861
What they say down there at the
commissioner's office?

919
00:47:13,862 --> 00:47:17,168
Look here, Rose, Mr. Rand called me
into his office today

920
00:47:17,169 --> 00:47:19,481
when I got back from talking to them people
down there

921
00:47:19,482 --> 00:47:21,851
he called me in and told me...

922
00:47:23,395 --> 00:47:25,375
... they was making me a driver.

923
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:27,135
Troy, you're kidding!

924
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,026
No I ain't. Ask Bono.

925
00:47:29,027 --> 00:47:31,194
Well, that's great, Troy. Now you don't have to
hassle them people no more.

926
00:47:31,195 --> 00:47:32,883
Aw hell...

927
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:36,188
I didn't think, I'd see you today.
I thought you was in jail.

928
00:47:36,189 --> 00:47:38,573
Got it all over the front page of the Courier
about them raiding Seefus' place

929
00:47:38,574 --> 00:47:41,032
where you be hanging out with
all them thugs.

930
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:43,033
Hey, Pop, that ain't got nothing to do
with me.

931
00:47:43,034 --> 00:47:46,486
I don't go down there gambling.
I go down there to sit in with the band.

932
00:47:46,487 --> 00:47:48,536
I ain't got nothing to do with the gambling part.

933
00:47:48,537 --> 00:47:51,721
- They got some good music down there.
- They got some rogues is what they got.

934
00:47:51,722 --> 00:47:54,074
How you been, Mr. Bono? Hi, Rose.

935
00:47:54,075 --> 00:47:56,823
I see where you playing down
at the Crawford Grill tonight.

936
00:47:56,824 --> 00:47:59,177
How come you ain't brought Bonnie like I told you.
You should have brought Bonnie with you,

937
00:47:59,178 --> 00:48:00,713
she ain't been over in a month of Sundays.

938
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:02,896
I was just in the neighborhood,
thought I'd stop by.

939
00:48:02,897 --> 00:48:05,632
- Here he come.
- Your daddy got a promotion on the rubbish.

940
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:08,195
He's gonna be the first colored driver.

941
00:48:08,196 --> 00:48:11,201
Ain't got to do nothing but sit up there and
read the paper like them white fellows.

942
00:48:11,202 --> 00:48:14,066
Hey, Pop, if you knew how to read
you'd be all right.

943
00:48:14,067 --> 00:48:17,881
Naw, naw, you mean if the nigger knew
how to drive he'd be all right.

944
00:48:17,882 --> 00:48:21,297
Been fighting with them people about driving
and ain't even got alicense.

945
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:23,304
Mr. Rand know you ain't got no driver's license?

946
00:48:23,305 --> 00:48:25,391
Driving ain't nothing. All you do is point the truck

947
00:48:25,392 --> 00:48:27,376
where you want it to go. Driving ain't nothing.

948
00:48:27,377 --> 00:48:30,127
Do they know you ain't got no driver's license?
That's what I'm talking about.

949
00:48:30,128 --> 00:48:33,586
I ain't asked if driving was easy. I asked if Mr. Rand know
you ain't got no driver's license.

950
00:48:33,587 --> 00:48:35,039
He ain't got to know.
The man ain't got to know my business.

951
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,439
Time he find out, I have two or three driver's licenses.

952
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,545
- Say, look here, Pop...
- I knew it was coming.

953
00:48:39,546 --> 00:48:42,594
I know what kind of "look here, Pop" that was.
The nigger fixing to ask me for some money.

954
00:48:42,595 --> 00:48:44,795
It's Friday night. It's my payday.

955
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:48,344
All them rogues down there on the avenue
the ones that ain't in jail

956
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:51,241
and Lyons is hopping in his shoes to
get down there with them.

957
00:48:51,242 --> 00:48:54,519
See, Pop, if you'd give somebody else a
chance to talk sometime

958
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,590
you'd see that I was fixing to pay you back
your ten dollars like I told you.

959
00:48:58,591 --> 00:49:01,720
Here, I told you I'd pay you when Bon-
nie got paid.

960
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:04,036
Naw, you go ahead and keep that ten dollars.
Put it in the bank.

961
00:49:04,037 --> 00:49:07,460
The next time you feel like you wanna come by here and
ask me for something you go on down there and get that.

962
00:49:07,461 --> 00:49:12,038
Here's your ten dollars, Pop. I told you I don't want you
to give me nothing. I just wanted to borrow ten dollars.

963
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:14,956
Naw, you keep that for the next
time you want to ask me.

964
00:49:14,957 --> 00:49:18,236
- Come on, Pop, here go your ten dollars.
- Troy, Why don't you let the boy pay you back?

965
00:49:22,254 --> 00:49:23,854
Here you go, Rose.

966
00:49:23,855 --> 00:49:26,827
If you don't take it I'm gonna have to hear about it
for the next six months.

967
00:49:26,828 --> 00:49:28,565
You can hand yours over here too, Troy.

968
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:30,249
You see this Bono, you see how they do me?

969
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,179
Yeah, Lucille do me the same way.

970
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,888
Better get ready for the judgement!

971
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:40,700
Better get ready for...

972
00:49:41,058 --> 00:49:43,637
Hey! Hey! There's Troy's boy!

973
00:49:43,638 --> 00:49:45,433
- How you doing, Uncle Gabe?
- Lyons...

974
00:49:47,915 --> 00:49:50,042
The King of the jungle!

975
00:49:51,034 --> 00:49:53,763
Rose, hey, Rose. Got a flower for you.

976
00:49:53,764 --> 00:49:56,522
Picked it myself.
That's the same rose like you is!

977
00:49:56,523 --> 00:49:58,528
That's right nice of you, Gabe.

978
00:49:58,529 --> 00:49:59,966
What you been doing, Uncle Gabe?

979
00:49:59,967 --> 00:50:02,189
Oh, I been chasing hellhounds

980
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:05,385
and waiting on the time to tell
Saint Peter to open the Gates.

981
00:50:05,386 --> 00:50:07,023
You been chasing hellhounds, huh? Well

982
00:50:07,024 --> 00:50:10,308
you doing the right thing, Uncle Gabe.
Somebody got to chase them.

983
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:11,807
Oh, yeah, I know it.

984
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:14,903
The devil's strong.
The devil ain't no pushover.

985
00:50:14,904 --> 00:50:17,640
Hellhounds snipping at everybody's heels.

986
00:50:17,641 --> 00:50:20,293
But I got my trumpet waiting on the Judgment time.

987
00:50:20,294 --> 00:50:21,993
Waiting on the Battle of Armageddon, huh?

988
00:50:21,994 --> 00:50:23,937
Ain't gonna be too much of a battle

989
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,602
when God get to waving that Judgment sword.

990
00:50:27,629 --> 00:50:30,693
But the people's gonna have a hell of a time
trying to get into Heaven

991
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,445
if them Gates ain't open.

992
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,891
You hear this, Pop?

993
00:50:33,892 --> 00:50:37,356
- Uncle Gabe, you all right!
- Lyons!

994
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,207
The King of the Jungle.

995
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:43,525
You're staying for supper, Gabe?
You want me to fix you a plate?

996
00:50:43,526 --> 00:50:46,505
I'll just take a sandwich, Rose.
I don't want no plate.

997
00:50:46,506 --> 00:50:48,756
I wanna eat with my hands.
I'll take a sandwich.

998
00:50:48,757 --> 00:50:51,317
How about you, Lyons? You staying?
Got some short ribs cooking.

999
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:53,916
Naw, I won't eat nothing till
after we finished playing.

1000
00:50:55,012 --> 00:50:57,302
You ought to come down and
listen to me play, Pop.

1001
00:50:57,303 --> 00:51:00,057
I don't like that Chinese music. All that noise.

1002
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:02,656
Go on in the house and wash up, Gabe.
I'll fix you a sandwich.

1003
00:51:03,067 --> 00:51:04,937
Troy's mad at me.

1004
00:51:06,031 --> 00:51:07,406
What you mad at Uncle Gabe for, Pop?

1005
00:51:07,407 --> 00:51:10,251
He thinks Troy's mad at him
'cause he moved over to Miss Pearl's.

1006
00:51:10,252 --> 00:51:12,602
I ain't mad at the man.
He can live where he want to live at.

1007
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:14,888
What he move over there for?
Miss Pearl don't like nobody.

1008
00:51:14,889 --> 00:51:16,627
She don't mind him none.
She treats him real nice.

1009
00:51:16,628 --> 00:51:18,068
She just don't allow all that singing.

1010
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:20,733
She don't mind that rent he be paying
that's what she don't mind.

1011
00:51:20,734 --> 00:51:22,334
Troy, I ain't going through
that with you no more.

1012
00:51:22,335 --> 00:51:25,401
He's over there 'cause he want to have his
own place. He can come and go as he please.

1013
00:51:25,402 --> 00:51:26,934
Hell, he could come and go as he please here.

1014
00:51:26,935 --> 00:51:29,089
I wasn't stopping him.
I ain't put no rules on him.

1015
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,925
It ain't the same thing, Troy.
And you know it.

1016
00:51:30,926 --> 00:51:32,366
Now, that's the last I wanna hear about that.

1017
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:34,587
I don't wanna hear nothing else
about Gabe and Miss Pearl.

1018
00:51:34,588 --> 00:51:37,267
- And next week...
- I'm ready for my sandwich, Rose.

1019
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:39,456
And next week, when that recruiter come
from that school

1020
00:51:39,457 --> 00:51:42,295
I want you to sign that paper and
go on and let Cory play football.

1021
00:51:42,296 --> 00:51:44,159
Then that'll be the last I have to hear about that.

1022
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:50,577
Cory got recruited? What school he
going to?

1023
00:51:50,578 --> 00:51:52,183
I ain't thinking about Cory nothing.

1024
00:51:52,184 --> 00:51:54,443
That boy walking around here
smelling his piss.

1025
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,564
Thinking he's gonna do what he want,
regardless of what I say.

1026
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,745
Look here, Bono

1027
00:51:59,746 --> 00:52:02,307
I left the commissioner's office and
went down to the A&P

1028
00:52:02,308 --> 00:52:04,586
that boy ain't working down there.
He lying to me.

1029
00:52:04,587 --> 00:52:06,346
Telling me he got his job back

1030
00:52:06,347 --> 00:52:08,224
telling me he working weekends

1031
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:09,710
telling me he working after school

1032
00:52:09,711 --> 00:52:12,051
Mr. Stawicki tell me he ain't
working down there at all!

1033
00:52:12,052 --> 00:52:13,375
Cory just growing up.

1034
00:52:13,376 --> 00:52:15,506
He's just busting at the seams
trying to fill out your shoes.

1035
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,830
I don't care what he's doing.

1036
00:52:16,831 --> 00:52:18,957
When he get to the point where
he wanna disobey me

1037
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:20,552
then it's time for him to move on.

1038
00:52:20,553 --> 00:52:22,214
Bono'll tell you that.

1039
00:52:22,215 --> 00:52:25,364
I bet he ain't never disobeyed his daddy
without paying the consequences.

1040
00:52:26,034 --> 00:52:27,773
I ain't never had a chance.

1041
00:52:28,192 --> 00:52:31,770
My daddy came on through.
But I ain't never knew him to see him.

1042
00:52:31,771 --> 00:52:34,448
or what he had on his mind or
where he went.

1043
00:52:34,449 --> 00:52:36,308
Just moving on through.

1044
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:38,659
Searching out the New Land.

1045
00:52:38,971 --> 00:52:41,343
That's what the old folks used to call it.

1046
00:52:41,344 --> 00:52:42,966
See a fellow moving around

1047
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:44,948
from place to place, woman to woman

1048
00:52:44,949 --> 00:52:47,336
called it "Searching out the New Land."

1049
00:52:47,337 --> 00:52:49,540
I can't say if he ever found it.

1050
00:52:49,998 --> 00:52:52,572
I come along, didn't want no kids.

1051
00:52:52,846 --> 00:52:55,166
I didn't know if I was gonna be
in one place long enough

1052
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,895
to fix on them right as their daddy.

1053
00:52:56,896 --> 00:52:58,966
I figured I was going searching too.

1054
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,716
As it turned out I been hooked up with Lucille

1055
00:53:01,717 --> 00:53:04,043
near about as long as your daddy been with Rose.

1056
00:53:04,044 --> 00:53:06,128
Going on sixteen years.

1057
00:53:06,129 --> 00:53:08,264
Sometimes I wish I had never known my daddy.

1058
00:53:08,265 --> 00:53:10,044
He ain't cared nothing about no kids.

1059
00:53:10,045 --> 00:53:12,418
A kid to him wasn't nothing.

1060
00:53:12,419 --> 00:53:15,502
All he wanted you to do
was learn how to walk

1061
00:53:15,503 --> 00:53:17,485
so he could start you to working.

1062
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:19,317
When it come time for eating,
he ate first.

1063
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:21,071
If there was anything left over,
that's what you got.

1064
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:24,528
Man would sit down and eat two
chickens and give you the wing.

1065
00:53:24,529 --> 00:53:27,565
You ought to stop that, Pop.
Everybody feed their kids.

1066
00:53:27,566 --> 00:53:32,379
No matter how hard times is everybody care about
their kids.Make sure they have something to eat.

1067
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,008
The only thing my daddy cared about was

1068
00:53:34,009 --> 00:53:36,008
getting them bales of cotton in to Mr. Lubin.

1069
00:53:36,009 --> 00:53:37,904
That's the only thing that mattered to him.

1070
00:53:37,905 --> 00:53:40,457
Sometimes I used to wonder
why he was still living.

1071
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:43,068
Wonder why the devil hadn't come
and got him.

1072
00:53:43,069 --> 00:53:45,073
"Get them bales of cotton in to Mr. Lubin."

1073
00:53:45,074 --> 00:53:46,476
and find out he owe him money

1074
00:53:46,477 --> 00:53:48,780
He should have just went on and left
when he saw he couldn't get nowhere.

1075
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:50,081
That's what I would have done.

1076
00:53:50,082 --> 00:53:52,907
How he gonna leave with eleven kids?
And where he gonna go?

1077
00:53:52,908 --> 00:53:54,977
He ain't knew how to do nothing but farm.

1078
00:53:54,978 --> 00:53:57,831
No, he was trapped and I think he knew it.

1079
00:53:57,832 --> 00:53:59,360
But I'll say this for him

1080
00:53:59,766 --> 00:54:01,741
he felt a responsibility toward us.

1081
00:54:01,742 --> 00:54:03,688
Maybe he ain't treated us the
way I felt he should have

1082
00:54:03,689 --> 00:54:05,528
but without that responsibility

1083
00:54:05,529 --> 00:54:07,448
he could have run off and left us

1084
00:54:07,449 --> 00:54:09,172
made his own way.

1085
00:54:09,173 --> 00:54:10,580
A lot of them did.

1086
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,486
Back in those days what you talking about

1087
00:54:12,487 --> 00:54:17,485
they walk out their front door and just take on down
one road or another and just keep on walking.

1088
00:54:17,486 --> 00:54:19,092
There you go! That's what I'm talking about.

1089
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:22,009
Just keep on walking till you come
to something else.

1090
00:54:22,588 --> 00:54:25,713
Ain't you never heard of nobody having
the walking blues?

1091
00:54:26,074 --> 00:54:28,900
Well, that's what you call it when
you just take off like that.

1092
00:54:28,901 --> 00:54:32,455
My daddy ain't had them walking blues!

1093
00:54:32,456 --> 00:54:34,593
He stayed right there with his family.

1094
00:54:34,594 --> 00:54:38,739
But he was just as evil as he could be.

1095
00:54:39,078 --> 00:54:42,392
My mama couldn't stand him.
Couldn't stand that evilness.

1096
00:54:42,393 --> 00:54:45,025
She run off when I was about eight.

1097
00:54:45,026 --> 00:54:47,346
She sneaked off one night after
he had gone to sleep.

1098
00:54:47,347 --> 00:54:50,624
Told me she was coming back for me.
I ain't never seen her no more.

1099
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:54,935
All his women run off and left him.
He wasn't good for nobody.

1100
00:54:55,452 --> 00:54:59,274
When my turn come to head out,
I was fourteen

1101
00:54:59,275 --> 00:55:01,995
and got to sniffing around Joe Canewell's daughter.

1102
00:55:02,881 --> 00:55:05,522
Had us an old mule we called Greyboy.

1103
00:55:05,523 --> 00:55:08,549
My daddy sent me out to do some plowing

1104
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:10,899
I got fooling around with Joe
Canewell's daughter.

1105
00:55:11,201 --> 00:55:14,792
We done found us a nice spot,
got real cozy with each other.

1106
00:55:14,793 --> 00:55:18,098
She about thirteen and we done figured
we was grown anyway

1107
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:21,470
So we down there enjoying ourselves,
ain't thinking about nothing.

1108
00:55:21,883 --> 00:55:24,359
We didn't know Greyboy had got loose

1109
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,476
and wandered back to the house
and my daddy was looking for me.

1110
00:55:27,477 --> 00:55:30,686
We down there by the creek enjoying ourselves
when my daddy come up on us.

1111
00:55:31,412 --> 00:55:33,061
Surprised us.

1112
00:55:33,647 --> 00:55:36,291
He had them leather straps off the mule

1113
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:39,538
and commenced to whupping me like
there was no tomorrow.

1114
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:42,845
I jumped up, mad and embarrassed.

1115
00:55:42,846 --> 00:55:44,413
I was scared of my daddy.

1116
00:55:45,028 --> 00:55:49,135
When he commenced to whupping on me, quite
naturally I run to get out of the way.

1117
00:55:49,136 --> 00:55:51,583
Now I thought he was mad
'cause I ain't done my work.

1118
00:55:51,584 --> 00:55:54,574
But I see where he was chasing me off

1119
00:55:54,575 --> 00:55:56,716
so he could have the gal for himself.

1120
00:55:57,589 --> 00:55:59,995
When I see what the matter of it was,

1121
00:56:00,703 --> 00:56:05,212
I lost all fear of my daddy.
Right there is where I become a man

1122
00:56:05,213 --> 00:56:07,203
at fourteen years of age.

1123
00:56:07,704 --> 00:56:09,711
Now it was my turn to run him off.

1124
00:56:10,482 --> 00:56:13,878
I picked up them same reins that
he had used on me.

1125
00:56:13,879 --> 00:56:16,211
I picked up them reins and commenced
to whupping on him.

1126
00:56:16,983 --> 00:56:19,111
The gal jumped up and run off

1127
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:22,442
and when he turned to face me,

1128
00:56:22,443 --> 00:56:24,557
I could see why the devil had never
come to get him

1129
00:56:24,558 --> 00:56:26,674
'cause he was the devil himself.

1130
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,220
I don't know what happened.

1131
00:56:30,511 --> 00:56:32,457
When I woke up,

1132
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:37,436
I was laying right there by the creek, and Blue
this old dog we had was licking my face.

1133
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:40,231
Both my eyes were swollen shut.

1134
00:56:40,755 --> 00:56:42,886
I thought I was blind.
I couldn't see nothing.

1135
00:56:42,887 --> 00:56:44,516
I just laid there

1136
00:56:44,517 --> 00:56:46,597
cried...

1137
00:56:51,759 --> 00:56:54,226
I didn't know what I was gonna do.

1138
00:56:54,747 --> 00:56:56,871
But I knew it

1139
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:59,605
time had come for me to leave
my daddy's house.

1140
00:57:00,615 --> 00:57:02,842
suddenly the world got big.

1141
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:08,235
And it was a long time before
I could cut it down to

1142
00:57:08,236 --> 00:57:09,992
where I could handle it.

1143
00:57:11,346 --> 00:57:14,561
Part of this cutting down where I got to

1144
00:57:14,562 --> 00:57:16,754
place what I could feel him kicking in my blood,

1145
00:57:16,755 --> 00:57:18,885
I knew the only thing that separated us

1146
00:57:18,886 --> 00:57:20,439
was a matter of a few years.

1147
00:57:23,626 --> 00:57:25,650
What you got there, Uncle Gabe?

1148
00:57:25,979 --> 00:57:29,413
Got me a ham sandwich.
Rose gave me a ham sandwich.

1149
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,776
I lost touch with everybody except Gabriel.

1150
00:57:39,113 --> 00:57:40,545
But...

1151
00:57:44,036 --> 00:57:45,696
I hope he's dead.

1152
00:57:49,857 --> 00:57:52,065
I hope he found some peace.

1153
00:57:52,838 --> 00:57:54,833
That's a heavy story, Pop.

1154
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:58,809
I didn't know you left home
when you was fourteen.

1155
00:58:00,042 --> 00:58:02,344
Fourteen's kinda young to be out on your own.

1156
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:04,058
I don't know what I would have done.

1157
00:58:05,207 --> 00:58:08,138
I got up from the creek and walked on
down to Mobile.

1158
00:58:08,139 --> 00:58:10,815
I was through with farming.
Figured I could do better in the city.

1159
00:58:10,816 --> 00:58:13,458
So I walked the two hundred miles to Mobile.

1160
00:58:13,459 --> 00:58:16,254
Wait a minute you ain't walked no two
hundred miles, Pop.

1161
00:58:17,117 --> 00:58:19,539
Ain't nobody gonna walk no
two hundred miles.

1162
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,291
You talking about some walking
there.

1163
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:24,388
That's the only way you got anywhere
back in them days.

1164
00:58:24,389 --> 00:58:26,787
Shhh. Damn if I wouldn't have hitched a ride
with somebody!

1165
00:58:27,726 --> 00:58:30,910
Who you gonna hitch it with? They ain't had no
cars and things like they got now.

1166
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:32,471
We talking about 1918.

1167
00:58:32,472 --> 00:58:34,182
What you all out here getting into?

1168
00:58:34,183 --> 00:58:36,416
I'm telling Lyons how good he got it.

1169
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:38,183
He don't know nothing about this I'm talking.

1170
00:58:38,184 --> 00:58:40,736
Lyons, that was Bonnie on the phone.
She say you supposed to pick her up.

1171
00:58:40,737 --> 00:58:42,111
Yeah, okay, Rose.

1172
00:58:42,434 --> 00:58:44,939
I walked on down to Mobile

1173
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,255
and hitched up with some of them fellows
that was coming up this way.

1174
00:58:48,256 --> 00:58:50,106
Got up here and found out

1175
00:58:50,107 --> 00:58:53,316
not only couldn't you get a job
you couldn't find no place to live.

1176
00:58:53,317 --> 00:58:56,399
I thought I was in freedom. Shhh.

1177
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,013
Colored folks living down there
on the riverbanks

1178
00:58:59,014 --> 00:59:01,358
in whatever kind of shelter
they could find for themselves.

1179
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:04,022
Right down there under the Brady Street Bridge.

1180
00:59:04,023 --> 00:59:08,085
Living down in shacks made of sticks
and tar paper.

1181
00:59:08,404 --> 00:59:12,379
Messed around there and went from bad to worse.
Started stealing.

1182
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,691
First it was food. Then I figured,

1183
00:59:14,692 --> 00:59:17,957
if I steal money I can buy me some food.
Buy me some shoes too!

1184
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:20,706
One thing led to another. Met your mama.

1185
00:59:20,707 --> 00:59:23,007
I was young and anxious to be a man.

1186
00:59:23,404 --> 00:59:26,096
Met your mama and had you.
What I do that for?

1187
00:59:26,097 --> 00:59:28,440
Now I got to worry about feeding you and her.

1188
00:59:28,441 --> 00:59:30,118
Got to steal three times as much.

1189
00:59:30,915 --> 00:59:33,233
Went out one day looking for somebody to rob

1190
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:36,085
that's what I was, a robber.

1191
00:59:36,086 --> 00:59:37,648
I'll tell you the truth.

1192
00:59:37,649 --> 00:59:40,220
I'm ashamed of it today. But it's the truth.

1193
00:59:40,876 --> 00:59:44,105
Went to rob this fellow pulled out my knife
and he pulled out a gun.

1194
00:59:44,106 --> 00:59:45,726
Shot me in the chest. It felt just like

1195
00:59:45,727 --> 00:59:48,325
somebody had taken a hot branding
iron and laid it on me.

1196
00:59:48,326 --> 00:59:51,695
When he shot me I jumped
at him with my knife.

1197
00:59:53,216 --> 00:59:54,981
They said I killed him

1198
00:59:55,308 --> 00:59:59,115
locked me up, put me in the penitentiary for fifteen years.
That's where I met Bono.

1199
00:59:59,116 --> 01:00:01,194
That's where I learned how to play baseball.

1200
01:00:01,195 --> 01:00:02,809
Got out that place and your mama had taken you

1201
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:05,205
and went on to make a life without me.

1202
01:00:05,206 --> 01:00:07,437
Fifteen years was a long time for her to wait.

1203
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:09,931
But that fifteen years cured me of
that robbing stuff.

1204
01:00:09,932 --> 01:00:11,262
Rose'll tell you.

1205
01:00:11,263 --> 01:00:12,901
I first met her, she asked me

1206
01:00:12,902 --> 01:00:15,263
if I had gotten all that foolishness out of my system.

1207
01:00:15,264 --> 01:00:18,770
And I said, "Baby, it's you and baseball
all what count with me."

1208
01:00:18,771 --> 01:00:20,485
You hear me, Bono?
I meant it too.

1209
01:00:20,486 --> 01:00:22,181
She said, "Which one comes first?"

1210
01:00:22,182 --> 01:00:25,169
I said, "Baby, ain't no doubt it's baseball

1211
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:28,617
but you stick and get old with me and
we'll both outlive this baseball. "

1212
01:00:28,618 --> 01:00:29,944
Am I right, Rose?

1213
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:35,316
- And it's true.
- Man, hush your mouth. You ain't said no such thing.

1214
01:00:35,317 --> 01:00:39,552
Talking about, "Baby, you know you'll always be
number one with me." That's what you was talking.

1215
01:00:40,447 --> 01:00:42,156
That's why I love this woman.

1216
01:00:42,157 --> 01:00:45,218
Rose'll keep you straight. You get off the
track, she'll straighten you up.

1217
01:00:45,219 --> 01:00:48,003
Lyons, you better get on up and get Bonnie.
She waiting on you.

1218
01:00:48,004 --> 01:00:49,690
Hey, Pop,

1219
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:52,318
why don't you come on down to the
Grill and hear me play?

1220
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:55,676
I ain't going down there. I'm too old to be
hanging up them clubs.

1221
01:00:55,677 --> 01:00:58,705
You got to be good to play down at the Grill.

1222
01:00:58,706 --> 01:01:00,305
Come on, Pop

1223
01:01:00,306 --> 01:01:03,170
- I got to get up in the morning.
- You ain't got to stay long.

1224
01:01:04,658 --> 01:01:08,584
Naw, I eat my supper and go to bed.

1225
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:13,274
Well, I gotta go. I'll see you later.

1226
01:01:16,203 --> 01:01:18,802
Don't you come around my house on my payday.

1227
01:01:18,803 --> 01:01:21,090
Pick up the phone and let somebody know
you coming.

1228
01:01:21,091 --> 01:01:23,170
And bring Bonnie in. You know
I'm always glad to see her.

1229
01:01:23,171 --> 01:01:25,746
Yeah, I'll do that, Rose. You take care now.

1230
01:01:26,707 --> 01:01:28,636
- See you, Pop.
- Bye.

1231
01:01:28,637 --> 01:01:30,014
See you, Mr. Bono.

1232
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:33,725
- See you, Uncle Gabe.
- Lyons! King of the jungle!

1233
01:01:34,883 --> 01:01:37,971
Is supper ready, woman? Me and you got
some business to take care of.

1234
01:01:37,972 --> 01:01:40,078
- I'm gonna tear it up too.
- Troy, I done told you now!

1235
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,254
Aw hell, woman this is Bono. Bono like family.

1236
01:01:42,255 --> 01:01:46,006
I done known this nigger since
how long I done know you?

1237
01:01:46,007 --> 01:01:47,381
It's been a long time.

1238
01:01:47,382 --> 01:01:49,604
I done known this nigger since Skippy was a pup.

1239
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:52,995
- Me and him done been through some times.
- You sure right about that.

1240
01:01:52,996 --> 01:01:55,203
Hell, I done know him longer than I known you.

1241
01:01:55,204 --> 01:01:57,118
And we still standing shoulder to shoulder.

1242
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,246
Hey, look here, Bono, a man can't ask for no more
than that.

1243
01:02:00,581 --> 01:02:02,907
- I love you, nigger.
- Oh, no!

1244
01:02:02,908 --> 01:02:06,196
I love you too. but I got to get home
see my woman.

1245
01:02:06,197 --> 01:02:09,068
You got yours in hand. I got to go get mine.

1246
01:02:10,962 --> 01:02:12,458
What you do that for, Pop?

1247
01:02:12,459 --> 01:02:14,319
What's the matter? Cory, what's the matter?

1248
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,405
Papa done went up to the school and told Coach
Zellman I can't play football no more.

1249
01:02:17,406 --> 01:02:18,991
Wouldn't even let me play the game.

1250
01:02:18,992 --> 01:02:20,601
Told him to tell the recruiter not to come.

1251
01:02:20,602 --> 01:02:22,257
- Troy...
- What you Troying me for.

1252
01:02:22,258 --> 01:02:24,091
Yeah, I did it. And the boy know why I did it.

1253
01:02:24,092 --> 01:02:26,154
Why you wanna do that to me?
That was the one chance I had.

1254
01:02:26,155 --> 01:02:28,973
- Ain't nothing wrong with Cory playing football, Troy.
- The boy lied to me.

1255
01:02:28,974 --> 01:02:31,147
I told the nigger if he wanna play football

1256
01:02:31,148 --> 01:02:34,162
to keep up his chores and hold down
that job at the A&P.

1257
01:02:34,163 --> 01:02:35,480
That was the conditions.

1258
01:02:35,481 --> 01:02:39,203
- Stopped down there to see Mr. Stawicki
- I can't work after school during the football season, Pop!

1259
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:42,175
I tried to tell you that Mr. Stawicki's
holding my job for me.

1260
01:02:42,176 --> 01:02:44,935
You don't never want to listen to nobody.
And then you wanna go and do this to me!

1261
01:02:44,936 --> 01:02:46,625
I ain't done nothing to you.
You done it to yourself

1262
01:02:46,626 --> 01:02:50,391
Just 'cause you didn't get a chance! You just
scared I'm gonna be better than you, that's all.

1263
01:02:55,525 --> 01:02:56,999
- Come here.
- Troy...

1264
01:02:57,849 --> 01:02:59,278
Troy.

1265
01:03:05,461 --> 01:03:06,852
Pick up.

1266
01:03:16,078 --> 01:03:17,536
Put it on.

1267
01:03:25,255 --> 01:03:26,758
Strap it up.

1268
01:03:32,512 --> 01:03:34,524
All right! See.

1269
01:03:35,823 --> 01:03:37,822
You done made a mistake.

1270
01:03:37,823 --> 01:03:40,726
- I didn't even do nothing!
- I'm gonna tell you what your mistake was.

1271
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,605
See, you swung at the ball and didn't hit it.

1272
01:03:44,502 --> 01:03:46,115
That's strike one.

1273
01:03:46,116 --> 01:03:47,882
you in the batter's box now.

1274
01:03:48,951 --> 01:03:52,039
You swung and you missed. See...?

1275
01:03:52,882 --> 01:03:54,531
That's strike one.

1276
01:03:57,063 --> 01:03:59,334
Don't you strike out!

1277
01:05:33,247 --> 01:05:35,954
Cory, I want you to help me clean out this cupboard.

1278
01:05:35,955 --> 01:05:37,714
I ain't quitting the team.

1279
01:05:37,715 --> 01:05:39,424
I don't care what Poppa say.

1280
01:05:39,425 --> 01:05:41,486
I'll talk to him when he gets back.

1281
01:05:41,983 --> 01:05:43,706
He had to go see about your Uncle Gabe.

1282
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:46,480
The police done arrested him.
Say he was disturbing the peace.

1283
01:05:46,481 --> 01:05:48,459
He'll be back directly.

1284
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:50,464
Come on in here and help me clean out
the top of this cupboard.

1285
01:05:50,465 --> 01:05:51,927
Come on.

1286
01:06:02,293 --> 01:06:04,176
Troy. What they say down there?

1287
01:06:04,177 --> 01:06:05,488
Ain't said nothing.

1288
01:06:05,489 --> 01:06:08,451
I give them fifty dollars and they let him go.

1289
01:06:08,452 --> 01:06:10,069
I'll talk to you about it.

1290
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:13,216
- Where's Cory?
- He's in there helping me clean out these cupboards.

1291
01:06:13,217 --> 01:06:15,257
Tell him to get his butt out here.

1292
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:19,231
All they want is the money.

1293
01:06:19,232 --> 01:06:21,997
That makes six or seven times I done went down
there and got him.

1294
01:06:21,998 --> 01:06:24,274
See me coming they stick out their hands.

1295
01:06:24,275 --> 01:06:27,217
Yeah. I know what you mean. That's all they care
about that money.

1296
01:06:27,218 --> 01:06:29,349
They don't care about what's right.

1297
01:06:30,345 --> 01:06:32,070
Nigger,...

1298
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:35,178
why you got to go and get some hard wood?

1299
01:06:35,179 --> 01:06:37,520
You ain't doing nothing but building
a little old fence.

1300
01:06:37,521 --> 01:06:39,348
Get you some soft pine wood.
That's all you need.

1301
01:06:39,349 --> 01:06:41,382
I know what I'm doing. This is outside wood.

1302
01:06:41,383 --> 01:06:43,578
You put pine wood inside the house.

1303
01:06:43,579 --> 01:06:46,299
Pine wood is inside wood.
This here is outside wood.

1304
01:06:46,637 --> 01:06:48,561
Now you tell me where the fence is gonna be?

1305
01:06:49,986 --> 01:06:52,128
You don't need this wood.

1306
01:06:52,129 --> 01:06:56,072
You can put it up with pine wood and it'll stand
as long as you gonna be here looking at it.

1307
01:06:56,073 --> 01:06:59,040
How you know how long I'm gonna be here, nigger?
Hell, I might just live forever.

1308
01:06:59,355 --> 01:07:01,954
Live longer than old man Horsely.

1309
01:07:01,955 --> 01:07:03,978
That's what Magee used to say.

1310
01:07:03,979 --> 01:07:06,571
Magee's a damn fool. Now you tell me who you
ever heard of gonna pull

1311
01:07:06,572 --> 01:07:09,546
their own teeth with a pair of rusty pliers.

1312
01:07:09,547 --> 01:07:12,676
The old folks my granddaddy used to pull
his teeth with pliers.

1313
01:07:12,677 --> 01:07:15,078
They ain't had no dentists
for the colored folks back then.

1314
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:17,612
Get clean pliers! You understand? Clean pliers!

1315
01:07:17,613 --> 01:07:18,929
Sterilize them!

1316
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:20,750
Besides we ain't living back then.

1317
01:07:20,751 --> 01:07:23,084
All Magee had to do was go down to
Doc Goldblum's.

1318
01:07:23,085 --> 01:07:26,477
I see where you and that Tallahassee gal
that Alberta

1319
01:07:26,478 --> 01:07:29,688
- I see where you all done got tight.
- What you mean, "got tight"?

1320
01:07:29,689 --> 01:07:32,129
I see where you be laughing and joking with her
all the time.

1321
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:34,929
I laughs and jokes with all of them, Bono.
You know me.

1322
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:37,395
That ain't the kind of laughing and joking
I'm talking about.

1323
01:07:38,412 --> 01:07:39,925
How you doing, Mr. Bono?

1324
01:07:39,926 --> 01:07:42,114
Get that saw from Bono and cut some wood.

1325
01:07:42,115 --> 01:07:44,343
He talking about the wood's too hard to cut.

1326
01:07:44,344 --> 01:07:47,541
Stand back there, Jim, and let that young boy
show you how it's done.

1327
01:07:47,542 --> 01:07:49,300
He's sure welcome to it.

1328
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:55,596
Whew- e- e! Look at that.

1329
01:07:55,597 --> 01:07:58,572
Big old strong boy. Look like Joe Louis.

1330
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:00,805
Hell, must be getting old the way

1331
01:08:00,806 --> 01:08:03,039
I'm watching that boy whip through that wood.

1332
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,659
I don't see why Mama want a fence
around the yard noways.

1333
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:08,404
Damn if I know either. What the hell
she keeping out with it?

1334
01:08:08,405 --> 01:08:10,494
She ain't got nothing nobody want.

1335
01:08:11,874 --> 01:08:14,189
Some people build fences to keep people out

1336
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:17,009
and other people build fences to keep people in.

1337
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:20,056
Rose wants to hold on to you all. She loves you.

1338
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:23,238
Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody to tell me
my wife loves me.

1339
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:26,879
Cory, go on in and see if you
can find that other saw.

1340
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,322
Where's it at?

1341
01:08:28,828 --> 01:08:31,398
I said find it! Look for it till you find it!

1342
01:08:34,557 --> 01:08:37,147
What's that supposed to mean? Wanna keep us in?

1343
01:08:52,104 --> 01:08:53,823
Troy...

1344
01:08:54,365 --> 01:08:57,919
I done known you seem like damn near my whole life.

1345
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,284
You and Rose both. I done know
both of you all for a long time.

1346
01:09:01,786 --> 01:09:04,180
I remember when you met Rose.

1347
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:07,396
When you was hitting them baseballs out the park.

1348
01:09:07,397 --> 01:09:09,889
A lot of them old gals was after you then.

1349
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,693
You had the pick of the litter.

1350
01:09:11,694 --> 01:09:16,311
When you picked Rose, I was happy for you.

1351
01:09:16,624 --> 01:09:19,866
That was the first time I knew
you had any sense.

1352
01:09:20,349 --> 01:09:23,541
I said. My man Troy knows what he's doing

1353
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:26,530
I'm gonna follow this nigger,
he might take me somewhere.

1354
01:09:26,531 --> 01:09:28,670
I been following you too.

1355
01:09:28,671 --> 01:09:32,889
I done learned a whole heap of things
about life watching you.

1356
01:09:33,918 --> 01:09:36,999
I done learned how to tell where the shit lies.

1357
01:09:37,342 --> 01:09:39,853
How to tell it from the alfalfa.

1358
01:09:40,231 --> 01:09:42,528
You done learned me a lot of things.

1359
01:09:42,529 --> 01:09:45,969
You showed me how to not make the
same mistakes,

1360
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:50,393
to take life as it comes along and
keep putting one foot in front of the other.

1361
01:09:51,052 --> 01:09:53,897
- Rose a good woman, Troy.
- I know she a good woman.

1362
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:57,103
I been married to her for eighteen years.
What you got on your mind, Bono?

1363
01:09:57,104 --> 01:10:00,541
I just say she a good woman. Just like I say anything.
I ain't got to have nothing on my mind.

1364
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:03,121
You just say she a good woman and
leave it hanging out there like that?

1365
01:10:03,122 --> 01:10:04,512
Why you telling me she a good woman?

1366
01:10:04,513 --> 01:10:07,514
She loves you, Troy. Rose loves you.

1367
01:10:07,515 --> 01:10:09,902
You saying I don't measure up.
That's what you trying to say.

1368
01:10:09,903 --> 01:10:11,750
I don't measure up 'cause I'm seeing this other gal.

1369
01:10:11,751 --> 01:10:13,055
I know what you trying to say.

1370
01:10:13,056 --> 01:10:15,394
I know what Rose means to you, Troy.

1371
01:10:15,395 --> 01:10:18,529
I'm just trying to say I don't want
to see you mess up.

1372
01:10:20,209 --> 01:10:21,582
Yeah,

1373
01:10:24,869 --> 01:10:28,221
I appreciate that, Bono.

1374
01:10:29,781 --> 01:10:33,270
If you was messing around on Lucille
I'd be telling you the same thing.

1375
01:10:33,658 --> 01:10:35,529
Well, that's all I got to say.

1376
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,539
I just say that because I love you both.

1377
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,399
Hell,

1378
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,363
you know me. I wasn't out there looking for nothing.

1379
01:10:45,364 --> 01:10:48,151
You can't find a better woman than Rose.
I know that.

1380
01:10:48,152 --> 01:10:50,295
But seems like this woman

1381
01:10:50,296 --> 01:10:52,562
just stuck on to me where I can't shake her loose.

1382
01:10:52,563 --> 01:10:56,118
I done wrestled with it, tried to throw her off me
but she just stuck on tighter.

1383
01:10:56,615 --> 01:10:58,800
Now she's stuck on for good.

1384
01:10:58,801 --> 01:11:01,932
You's in control that's what you tell me
all the time.

1385
01:11:01,933 --> 01:11:03,722
You responsible for what you do.

1386
01:11:03,723 --> 01:11:06,029
I ain't ducking the responsibility of it.
As long as it sets right

1387
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:08,014
in my heart, then I'm okay.

1388
01:11:08,015 --> 01:11:11,084
'Cause that's all I listen to. It'll tell
me right from wrong every time.

1389
01:11:11,085 --> 01:11:14,249
And I ain't talking about doing Rose no bad turn.
I love Rose.

1390
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:16,133
She done carried me a long ways

1391
01:11:16,134 --> 01:11:17,731
and I love and respect her for that.

1392
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:20,448
I know you do. That's why I don't want
to see you hurt her.

1393
01:11:20,967 --> 01:11:24,048
But what you gonna do when she find out?

1394
01:11:24,049 --> 01:11:26,152
What you got then?

1395
01:11:26,153 --> 01:11:29,559
If you try and juggle both of them,
sooner or later you gonna drop one of them.

1396
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:32,112
- That's common sense.
- Yeah, I hear what you saying, Bono.

1397
01:11:33,078 --> 01:11:35,252
I been trying to figure a way to work it out.

1398
01:11:35,253 --> 01:11:37,225
Work it out right, Troy.

1399
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:40,306
I ain't trying be getting all up between
you and Rose's business

1400
01:11:40,307 --> 01:11:42,564
but work it so it come out right.

1401
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:44,797
Aw hell, I get all up between you and Lucille's
business.

1402
01:11:44,798 --> 01:11:48,072
When you gonna buy that woman that refrigerator
she been wanting?

1403
01:11:48,073 --> 01:11:50,983
Don't tell me you ain't got no money now.
I know who your banker is.

1404
01:11:50,984 --> 01:11:54,642
Mellon don't need that money bad as Lucille want
that refrigerator. I know that.

1405
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:56,060
- Tell you what I'll do
- What?

1406
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:58,449
when you finish building this fence for Rose

1407
01:11:58,450 --> 01:11:59,873
I'll buy Lucille that refrigerator.

1408
01:11:59,874 --> 01:12:02,248
You done stuck your foot in your mouth now!

1409
01:12:03,578 --> 01:12:06,784
- Hey, nigger where you going?
- I'm going home.

1410
01:12:06,785 --> 01:12:08,744
I know you don't expect me to help you now.

1411
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:10,554
I'm protecting my money.

1412
01:12:10,555 --> 01:12:13,737
I wanna see you put up that fence
by yourself.

1413
01:12:13,738 --> 01:12:15,214
That's what I want to see.

1414
01:12:15,215 --> 01:12:17,612
You'll be here another six months without me.

1415
01:12:17,613 --> 01:12:18,968
Nigger, you ain't right

1416
01:12:18,969 --> 01:12:20,734
When it comes to my money

1417
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:23,958
I'm right as fireworks on the Fourth of July.

1418
01:12:23,959 --> 01:12:25,576
We gonna see.

1419
01:12:25,577 --> 01:12:27,556
You better get out your bankbook.

1420
01:13:18,778 --> 01:13:21,008
What they say down there?
What's happening with Gabe?

1421
01:13:21,009 --> 01:13:24,641
I went down there and got him out.
Cost me fifty dollars.

1422
01:13:24,642 --> 01:13:26,067
Say he was disturbing the peace.

1423
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,440
Judge set up a hearing for him in three weeks.

1424
01:13:28,441 --> 01:13:31,293
Say to show cause why he shouldn't be recommitted.

1425
01:13:31,294 --> 01:13:32,992
Well, what's you say?
What'd you tell the judge?

1426
01:13:32,993 --> 01:13:35,087
I told him, I'd take care him.

1427
01:13:35,088 --> 01:13:36,805
It didn't make no sense to recommit the man.

1428
01:13:36,806 --> 01:13:40,668
He stuck out his big greasy palm, and told me
to give him fifty dollars and take him on home.

1429
01:13:40,669 --> 01:13:42,798
Where's he at now? Where'd he go off to?

1430
01:13:42,799 --> 01:13:45,019
He's gone on about his business.
He don't need nobody to hold his hand.

1431
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,459
Well, I don't know. Seem like that would be
the best place for him

1432
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:48,311
if they did put him into the hospital.

1433
01:13:48,312 --> 01:13:50,878
I know what you're gonna say.
But that's what I think would be best.

1434
01:13:50,879 --> 01:13:52,713
The man done had his life ruined fighting for what?

1435
01:13:52,714 --> 01:13:54,024
And they wanna take and lock him up.

1436
01:13:54,025 --> 01:13:55,996
Let him be free. He don't bother nobody.

1437
01:13:55,997 --> 01:14:00,226
Well, everybody got their own way of
looking at it I guess.

1438
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:01,615
Come on and get your lunch.

1439
01:14:01,616 --> 01:14:04,613
I got a bowl of lima beans and some cornbread
in the oven. Come on get something to eat.

1440
01:14:04,614 --> 01:14:06,073
Ain't no sense you fretting over Gabe.

1441
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:09,002
- Rose, I got something to tell you.
- Well, wait till I put the food on the table.

1442
01:14:09,003 --> 01:14:10,396
Rose...

1443
01:14:10,882 --> 01:14:14,369
I don't know how to tell you this.

1444
01:14:17,628 --> 01:14:19,542
I can't explain it none.

1445
01:14:19,543 --> 01:14:22,851
It sort of grows on you
till it gets out of hand.

1446
01:14:24,016 --> 01:14:28,789
It starts out like a little bush and the next thing
you know it's a whole forest.

1447
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:31,288
- Troy, what is you talking about?
- I'm talking, woman, let me talk.

1448
01:14:31,289 --> 01:14:33,710
I'm trying to tell you

1449
01:14:33,711 --> 01:14:35,627
Trying to find a way to tell you.

1450
01:14:41,145 --> 01:14:43,110
I'm gonna be a daddy.

1451
01:14:45,623 --> 01:14:47,951
I'm gonna be somebody's daddy.

1452
01:14:52,561 --> 01:14:55,350
Troy, you're not telling me this?
You're gonna be what?

1453
01:14:55,351 --> 01:14:59,263
- You gonna be somebody's daddy, telling your wife?
- Rose...Now...

1454
01:14:59,264 --> 01:15:01,438
Hey, Troy! Hey, Rose.

1455
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:04,202
I have to wait eighteen years to hear
something like this.

1456
01:15:04,203 --> 01:15:05,625
Hey, Rose.

1457
01:15:07,347 --> 01:15:09,565
I got a flower for you.

1458
01:15:12,135 --> 01:15:15,849
That's a rose. Same rose like you is.

1459
01:15:21,074 --> 01:15:22,576
Thanks, Gabe.

1460
01:15:22,577 --> 01:15:23,996
Troy, you ain't mad at me is you?

1461
01:15:23,997 --> 01:15:25,873
Them bad mens come and put me away.

1462
01:15:25,874 --> 01:15:27,980
- You ain't mad at me is you?
- Naw, Gabe, I ain't mad at you.

1463
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:29,883
Eighteen years and you wanna come with this.

1464
01:15:29,884 --> 01:15:32,637
See what I got? Got a brand-new quarter.

1465
01:15:35,374 --> 01:15:38,872
- Rose, it's just...
- Ain't nothing you can say, Troy. Ain't no way of explaining that.

1466
01:15:38,873 --> 01:15:42,003
Fellow that give me this quarter had
a whole mess of them.

1467
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:44,433
I'm gonna keep this quarter till it stop shining.

1468
01:15:44,434 --> 01:15:48,202
Gabe, go on up front now. I got some watermelon
in the Frigidaire. I'll get you a piece.

1469
01:15:48,203 --> 01:15:50,897
Say, Rose, you know I was chasing hellhounds

1470
01:15:50,898 --> 01:15:53,860
and them bad mens come and get me
and take me away.

1471
01:15:53,861 --> 01:15:56,283
Troy helped me. He come down there and told them

1472
01:15:56,284 --> 01:15:59,302
they better let me go before he beat
them up.

1473
01:15:59,303 --> 01:16:01,784
- Yeah, he did!
- You go on up front now, Gabe.

1474
01:16:01,785 --> 01:16:04,489
I'll get you a piece of watermelon.
Them bad mens is gone now.

1475
01:16:04,490 --> 01:16:09,032
Okay, Rose gonna bring me some watermelon.
The kind with the stripes on it.

1476
01:16:14,461 --> 01:16:16,180
Why, Troy?

1477
01:16:17,909 --> 01:16:19,341
Why?

1478
01:16:19,342 --> 01:16:21,841
After all these years,

1479
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:24,920
to come dragging this in to me now.

1480
01:16:24,921 --> 01:16:26,813
It don't make no sense at your age.

1481
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:31,579
I could have expected this ten or
fifteen years ago, but not now.

1482
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,860
Age ain't got nothing to do with it, Rose.

1483
01:16:37,865 --> 01:16:40,968
I done tried to be everything a wife should be.

1484
01:16:42,742 --> 01:16:46,182
Everything a wife could be.
Been married eighteen years

1485
01:16:46,183 --> 01:16:50,089
and I got to live to see the day you tell me
you been seeing another woman

1486
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:52,670
and done fathered a child by her.

1487
01:17:05,533 --> 01:17:09,059
And you know I ain't never wanted
no half- nothing in my family.

1488
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:15,757
My whole family is half.
Everybody got different fathers and mothers

1489
01:17:15,758 --> 01:17:18,001
my two sisters and my brother.

1490
01:17:18,002 --> 01:17:20,868
Can't hardly tell who's who. Can't never sit down
and talk about Papa and Mama.

1491
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:23,333
It's your papa and your mama
and my papa and my mama

1492
01:17:23,334 --> 01:17:26,271
I ain't never wanted that for none of my children.

1493
01:17:26,272 --> 01:17:28,702
And now you wanna drag your behind in here
and tell me something like this.

1494
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:30,805
Stop it now. You ought to know.
It's time for you to know.

1495
01:17:30,806 --> 01:17:33,016
Well, I don't want to know, goddamn it!

1496
01:17:52,289 --> 01:17:53,625
Rose.

1497
01:17:56,452 --> 01:17:59,309
I just can't make it go away. It's done now.

1498
01:17:59,928 --> 01:18:04,333
I can't wish the circumstance of the thing away.

1499
01:18:04,334 --> 01:18:06,242
And you don't want to either.

1500
01:18:06,711 --> 01:18:08,844
Maybe you want to wish me and my boy away.

1501
01:18:08,845 --> 01:18:12,610
Maybe that's what you want?
Well, you can't wish us away.

1502
01:18:12,611 --> 01:18:15,067
I've got eighteen years of my life invested in you.

1503
01:18:15,068 --> 01:18:16,745
You ought to have stayed upstairs in my bed
where you belong.

1504
01:18:16,746 --> 01:18:19,154
Rose, now listen to me, we can get a
handle on this thing.

1505
01:18:19,490 --> 01:18:21,548
We can talk this out, come to an understanding.

1506
01:18:21,549 --> 01:18:22,887
All of a sudden it's "we".

1507
01:18:22,888 --> 01:18:25,856
Where was "we" at when you was down there
rolling around with some godforsaken woman?

1508
01:18:25,857 --> 01:18:28,857
"We" should have come to an understanding before
you started making a damn fool of yourself.

1509
01:18:28,858 --> 01:18:31,360
You're a day late and a dollar short
when it comes to an understanding with me.

1510
01:18:31,361 --> 01:18:33,502
Rose, is just that...

1511
01:18:34,811 --> 01:18:37,202
She gives me a different idea

1512
01:18:37,687 --> 01:18:41,138
a different understanding about myself.

1513
01:18:41,139 --> 01:18:42,809
I can step out of this house

1514
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:45,440
and get away from the pressures and problems

1515
01:18:45,441 --> 01:18:49,062
be a different man. I ain't got to wonder
how I'm get the roof fixed or gonna pay the bills.

1516
01:18:49,063 --> 01:18:51,115
I can just...

1517
01:18:52,674 --> 01:18:55,644
... be a part of myself that I ain't never been before.

1518
01:18:56,704 --> 01:18:58,839
What I want to know is:

1519
01:19:01,106 --> 01:19:03,063
What I want to know...

1520
01:19:03,673 --> 01:19:06,451
is do you plan to continue seeing her.

1521
01:19:06,768 --> 01:19:08,814
That's all you can say to me.

1522
01:19:09,827 --> 01:19:13,552
I can sit up in her house and laugh.
Do you understand what I'm saying.

1523
01:19:14,056 --> 01:19:17,249
I can laugh out loud and it feels good.

1524
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:20,695
It reaches all the way down to the bottom of my shoes.
Rose...

1525
01:19:22,885 --> 01:19:25,179
I can't give that up.

1526
01:19:31,652 --> 01:19:34,281
Maybe you ought to go on and
stay down there with her

1527
01:19:34,282 --> 01:19:35,841
if she a better woman than me.

1528
01:19:35,842 --> 01:19:38,955
It ain't about nobody being a better woman or
nothing. Rose, you ain't to blame.

1529
01:19:38,956 --> 01:19:41,091
A man couldn't ask a better wife than you've been.

1530
01:19:41,092 --> 01:19:42,936
And I'm responsible for it.

1531
01:19:42,937 --> 01:19:44,430
I done locked myself into a pattern

1532
01:19:44,431 --> 01:19:46,788
trying to take care of you all
that I forgot about myself.

1533
01:19:46,789 --> 01:19:49,695
What the hell was I there for? That was my job,
not somebody else's.

1534
01:19:49,696 --> 01:19:52,845
Rose, listen to me, I done tried all my life
to live decent

1535
01:19:52,846 --> 01:19:56,321
to live a clean hard useful life.

1536
01:19:56,322 --> 01:19:59,120
I tried to be a good husband to you.
In every way I knew how.

1537
01:19:59,597 --> 01:20:01,646
Maybe I come into the world backwards,
I don't know.

1538
01:20:01,647 --> 01:20:04,795
But. You born with two strikes on you
before you come to the plate.

1539
01:20:04,796 --> 01:20:09,044
You got to guard it closely always looking
for the curveball on the inside corner.

1540
01:20:09,045 --> 01:20:12,280
You can't afford a call strike.
You can't afford to let none get past you.

1541
01:20:12,281 --> 01:20:14,354
If you going down, you going down swinging.

1542
01:20:14,355 --> 01:20:17,227
Everything lined up against you.

1543
01:20:18,327 --> 01:20:20,023
What you gonna do.

1544
01:20:21,496 --> 01:20:23,055
I fooled them, Rose.

1545
01:20:23,056 --> 01:20:24,699
I bunted.

1546
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:28,090
When I found you and Cory and a halfway decent job

1547
01:20:28,091 --> 01:20:30,091
I was safe. Couldn't nothing touch me.

1548
01:20:31,007 --> 01:20:34,045
I wasn't gonna strike out no more.
I wasn't going back to the penitentiary.

1549
01:20:34,046 --> 01:20:36,527
I wasn't gonna lay in the streets
with a bottle of wine.

1550
01:20:36,528 --> 01:20:39,062
I was safe. I had me a family.

1551
01:20:39,063 --> 01:20:40,971
A job...

1552
01:20:41,776 --> 01:20:44,447
I wasn't gonna get that last strike.

1553
01:20:46,214 --> 01:20:49,150
I was standing on the first base.

1554
01:20:49,151 --> 01:20:50,867
waiting for one of them boys to knock me in

1555
01:20:50,868 --> 01:20:53,139
- and bring me home...
- You should have stayed in my bed, Troy.

1556
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,763
Then when I saw that gal, she firmed up my backbone.

1557
01:20:54,764 --> 01:20:57,861
And I got to thinking that if I tried
maybe I could steal second.

1558
01:20:57,862 --> 01:21:01,778
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- You should have held me tight. You should have grabbed me and held on.

1559
01:21:01,779 --> 01:21:04,886
I stood on first base for eighteen years and
I thought well, goddamn it, go on for it!

1560
01:21:04,887 --> 01:21:07,367
We're not talking about baseball!

1561
01:21:07,719 --> 01:21:11,299
We're talking about you going off to lay in bed with another
woman and then bring it home to me. That's what we're talking about.

1562
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,849
- We ain't talking about no baseball.
- Rose, you're not listening to me.

1563
01:21:14,850 --> 01:21:17,905
I'm trying to explain it to you in
the best way I know how.

1564
01:21:18,777 --> 01:21:20,814
It's not easy for me to admit

1565
01:21:20,815 --> 01:21:23,786
that I been standing in the same place
for eighteen years.

1566
01:21:23,787 --> 01:21:25,791
I been standing with you!

1567
01:21:26,352 --> 01:21:28,506
I been right here with you, Troy.

1568
01:21:28,507 --> 01:21:30,428
I got a life too.

1569
01:21:30,429 --> 01:21:34,491
I gave eighteen years of my life
to stand in the same spot as you.

1570
01:21:34,858 --> 01:21:37,110
Don't you think I ever wanted other things?

1571
01:21:37,111 --> 01:21:38,969
Don't you think I had dreams and hopes?

1572
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:41,181
What about my life? What about me?

1573
01:21:41,182 --> 01:21:44,522
Don't you think it ever crossed my mind
to want to know other men?

1574
01:21:44,523 --> 01:21:47,113
That I wanted to lay up somewhere

1575
01:21:47,114 --> 01:21:48,873
and forget about my responsibilities?

1576
01:21:48,874 --> 01:21:50,546
That I wanted someone to make me laugh

1577
01:21:50,547 --> 01:21:52,533
so I could feel good?

1578
01:21:52,534 --> 01:21:54,891
You not the only one who's got wants and needs.

1579
01:21:54,892 --> 01:21:56,594
But I held on to you, Troy.

1580
01:21:56,595 --> 01:21:59,511
I took all my feelings, my wants

1581
01:21:59,512 --> 01:22:03,172
and needs, my dreams and I buried them inside you.

1582
01:22:03,173 --> 01:22:05,505
I planted a seed and watched and prayed over it.

1583
01:22:05,506 --> 01:22:08,486
I planted myself inside you and waited to bloom.

1584
01:22:08,487 --> 01:22:10,196
And it didn't take me no eighteen years to realize

1585
01:22:10,197 --> 01:22:14,195
the soil was hard and rocky
and it wasn't never gonna bloom.

1586
01:22:14,196 --> 01:22:16,085
But I held on to you, Troy.

1587
01:22:16,086 --> 01:22:17,656
I held you tighter.

1588
01:22:17,657 --> 01:22:19,231
You was my husband.

1589
01:22:19,232 --> 01:22:22,405
I owed you everything I had.

1590
01:22:22,406 --> 01:22:24,741
Every part of me I could find to give you.

1591
01:22:24,742 --> 01:22:28,460
And upstairs in that room with the darkness
falling in on me

1592
01:22:28,461 --> 01:22:33,445
I gave everything I had to try
and erase the doubt that

1593
01:22:33,446 --> 01:22:36,139
you wasn't the finest man in the world,

1594
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:38,631
and wherever you was going,
I was gonna be there with you.

1595
01:22:38,632 --> 01:22:40,862
'Cause you was my husband.

1596
01:22:42,275 --> 01:22:46,056
'Cause that's the only way I was gonna survive
as your wife.

1597
01:22:46,687 --> 01:22:50,797
You always talking about what you give
and what you don't have to give.

1598
01:22:51,286 --> 01:22:53,200
But you take too. Troy.

1599
01:22:53,201 --> 01:22:55,826
You take and don't even know nobody's giving!

1600
01:22:55,827 --> 01:22:57,305
- You say I take and don't give!
- Troy! You're hurting me!

1601
01:22:57,306 --> 01:22:59,608
- You say I take and don't give.
- Troy, you're hurting my arm! Let go.

1602
01:22:59,609 --> 01:23:01,488
I done give you everything I got. Don't you tell that lie on me.
- Troy!

1603
01:23:01,489 --> 01:23:04,509
- Don't you tell that lie on me!
- Troy, get off me!

1604
01:23:05,086 --> 01:23:06,536
Troy! Troy!

1605
01:23:06,537 --> 01:23:08,149
All right.

1606
01:23:08,887 --> 01:23:10,580
That's strike two.

1607
01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:13,452
You stay away from around me, boy.

1608
01:23:14,092 --> 01:23:15,900
Don't you strike out.

1609
01:23:16,901 --> 01:23:19,360
You living with a full count.

1610
01:23:22,649 --> 01:23:24,617
DON'T YOU STRIKE OUT!

1611
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:50,495
MOTHER

1612
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,057
Troy, I want to talk to you.

1613
01:26:49,365 --> 01:26:50,979
All of a sudden?

1614
01:26:53,264 --> 01:26:56,107
After all this time, you want to talk to me?

1615
01:26:57,461 --> 01:27:00,299
You ain't wanted to talk to me for months.
You ain't wanted to talk to me last night.

1616
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,014
You ain't wanted no part of me then.

1617
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:04,334
What you wanna talk to me about now?

1618
01:27:07,548 --> 01:27:10,970
- Tomorrow's Friday.
- I know what day tomorrow is.

1619
01:27:10,971 --> 01:27:12,525
You think I don't know tomorrow's Friday?

1620
01:27:12,526 --> 01:27:14,620
My whole life I ain't done nothing
but look to see Friday coming

1621
01:27:14,621 --> 01:27:15,952
and you got to tell me it's Friday.

1622
01:27:15,953 --> 01:27:17,771
I want to know if you're coming home.

1623
01:27:17,772 --> 01:27:21,509
I always come home, Rose. You know that.
There ain't never been a night I ain't come home.

1624
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:23,617
That ain't what I mean and you know it.

1625
01:27:23,618 --> 01:27:26,287
I want to know if you're coming straight home
after work.

1626
01:27:26,971 --> 01:27:29,401
I figure I'd cash my check,

1627
01:27:29,402 --> 01:27:31,683
hang out at Taylors' with the boys,
maybe play a game of checkers

1628
01:27:31,684 --> 01:27:34,065
Troy, I can't live like this. I won't live like this.

1629
01:27:34,066 --> 01:27:35,935
You livin' on borrowed time with me.

1630
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:37,703
It's been going on six months now
you ain't been coming home.

1631
01:27:37,704 --> 01:27:40,057
I come home every night. Every night of the year.

1632
01:27:40,058 --> 01:27:42,411
That's 365 days.

1633
01:27:43,733 --> 01:27:46,494
I want you to come home tomorrow after work.

1634
01:27:51,209 --> 01:27:54,128
Rose, I don't mess up my pay. You know that.

1635
01:27:55,169 --> 01:27:57,355
I take my pay and I give it to you.

1636
01:27:57,356 --> 01:27:59,789
I don't have no money but what you give me back.

1637
01:28:00,472 --> 01:28:03,835
I just want to have a little time to myself,

1638
01:28:03,836 --> 01:28:05,198
a little time to enjoy life.

1639
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:07,128
What about me? When's my time to enjoy life.

1640
01:28:07,129 --> 01:28:09,291
I don't know what to tell you, Rose.
I'm doing the best I can.

1641
01:28:09,292 --> 01:28:10,757
You ain't been coming home from work but time enough

1642
01:28:10,758 --> 01:28:13,690
to change your clothes and run out and
you wanna call that the best you can do?

1643
01:28:15,088 --> 01:28:18,511
I'm going over to the hospital to see Alberta.

1644
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:23,745
She went into the hospital this afternoon.
Look like she might have the baby early.

1645
01:28:25,482 --> 01:28:27,408
I won't be gone long.

1646
01:28:34,147 --> 01:28:36,671
Well, you ought to know. They went over to
Miss Pearl's and got Gabe today.

1647
01:28:36,672 --> 01:28:38,843
She said you told them to go ahead and lock him up.

1648
01:28:40,474 --> 01:28:43,732
I ain't said no such thing. Whoever told you
that is telling a lie.

1649
01:28:44,424 --> 01:28:46,633
Miss Pearl ain't doing nothing but telling a big fat lie.

1650
01:28:46,634 --> 01:28:48,460
She ain't had to tell me. I read it on the papers.

1651
01:28:48,461 --> 01:28:50,684
- What it say, huh?
- It said you told them to take him.

1652
01:28:50,685 --> 01:28:54,369
Then they screwed that up, just like they screw up everything.
I ain't worried about what they got on the paper.

1653
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:56,058
Say the government send part of his check

1654
01:28:56,059 --> 01:28:57,767
to the hospital and the other part to you.

1655
01:28:57,768 --> 01:29:00,207
I ain't got nothing to do with that if that's the way it works.
I ain't made up the rules about

1656
01:29:00,208 --> 01:29:01,883
You did Gabe just like you did Cory.

1657
01:29:01,884 --> 01:29:04,806
You wouldn't sign the paper for Cory but
you signed for Gabe. You signed that paper.

1658
01:29:04,807 --> 01:29:06,980
I told you I ain't signed nothing, woman!

1659
01:29:06,981 --> 01:29:08,602
The only thing I signed was the release form.

1660
01:29:08,603 --> 01:29:11,051
Hell, I can't read, I don't know what
they had on that paper!

1661
01:29:11,052 --> 01:29:12,783
I ain't signed nothing about sending Gabe away.

1662
01:29:12,784 --> 01:29:15,342
I said send him to the hospital
you said let him go free

1663
01:29:15,343 --> 01:29:17,984
then you went down there and signed him
to the hospital for half his money.

1664
01:29:17,985 --> 01:29:20,277
You went back on yourself, Troy.
You gonna have to answer for that.

1665
01:29:20,278 --> 01:29:22,001
you just been over there talking to Miss Pearl.

1666
01:29:22,002 --> 01:29:24,462
She done got mad 'cause she ain't getting
Gabe's rent money. That's all it is.

1667
01:29:24,463 --> 01:29:27,053
- Troy, I seen where you signed the paper.
- You ain't seen nothing I signed.

1668
01:29:27,054 --> 01:29:29,781
What she doing got papers on my brother anyway?

1669
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,135
Miss Pearl doing nothing but telling a big fat lie.
And I'm gonna tell her about it too!

1670
01:29:41,332 --> 01:29:43,542
You ain't seen nothing I signed!

1671
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:45,908
Say...

1672
01:29:47,597 --> 01:29:49,946
you ain't seen nothing I signed!

1673
01:31:46,606 --> 01:31:48,165
Troy.

1674
01:31:50,418 --> 01:31:52,004
Troy...

1675
01:31:57,153 --> 01:32:00,179
that was the hospital. Alberta had the baby.

1676
01:32:01,210 --> 01:32:04,173
What she have? What is it?

1677
01:32:05,218 --> 01:32:06,901
It's a girl.

1678
01:32:14,003 --> 01:32:16,491
I better get on down to the hospital to see her.

1679
01:32:18,210 --> 01:32:19,721
Troy...

1680
01:32:19,722 --> 01:32:21,970
Rose I got to go see her now. That's only right

1681
01:32:27,283 --> 01:32:28,859
what's the matter

1682
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:30,630
the baby's all right, ain't it?

1683
01:32:33,711 --> 01:32:36,729
Alberta died having the baby.

1684
01:32:37,907 --> 01:32:40,293
Died, you say she's dead?

1685
01:32:43,266 --> 01:32:45,125
Alberta is dead?

1686
01:32:45,126 --> 01:32:47,847
They said they done all they could.

1687
01:32:49,482 --> 01:32:51,605
They couldn't do nothing for her.

1688
01:33:21,722 --> 01:33:25,153
The baby? How's the baby?

1689
01:33:26,484 --> 01:33:28,714
They say it's healthy.

1690
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:32,641
I wonder who's gonna bury her.

1691
01:33:32,642 --> 01:33:35,543
She had family, Rose. She wasn't living in the
world by herself.

1692
01:33:35,544 --> 01:33:37,850
I know she wasn't living in the world by herself.

1693
01:33:37,851 --> 01:33:40,709
- Next thing you gonna want to know if she had any insurance.
- Troy, you ain't got to talk like that.

1694
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:42,950
That's the first thing that jumped out your mouth.
"Who's gonna bury her?"

1695
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:44,537
Like I'm fixing to take on that task for myself.

1696
01:33:44,538 --> 01:33:46,511
I am your wife. Don't push me away.

1697
01:33:46,512 --> 01:33:49,058
I ain't pushing nobody away.

1698
01:33:49,059 --> 01:33:51,059
Just give me some space,
Just give me some room to breathe!

1699
01:34:21,701 --> 01:34:23,629
All right, Mr. Death.

1700
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,765
I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do.

1701
01:34:31,937 --> 01:34:34,082
I'm gonna take

1702
01:34:34,426 --> 01:34:38,239
and build me a fence around this yard. See?

1703
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:43,472
I'm gonna build me a fence around
what belongs to me.

1704
01:34:43,473 --> 01:34:46,954
And then I want you to stay on the other side.

1705
01:34:46,955 --> 01:34:48,815
You stay over there until you're ready for me.

1706
01:34:48,816 --> 01:34:50,116
Then you come on.

1707
01:34:52,243 --> 01:34:56,082
Bring your army. Bring your sickle.
Bring your wrestling clothes.

1708
01:34:56,083 --> 01:34:58,699
I ain't gonna fall down on my vigilance this time.

1709
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:00,135
You ain't gonna...

1710
01:35:02,826 --> 01:35:05,182
You ain't gonna sneak up on me no more.

1711
01:35:07,838 --> 01:35:09,389
When you ready for me

1712
01:35:09,390 --> 01:35:11,982
when the top of your list say Troy Maxson

1713
01:35:11,983 --> 01:35:14,005
You come up and knock on the front door.

1714
01:35:14,006 --> 01:35:16,212
Ain't nobody else got nothing to do with this.

1715
01:35:16,213 --> 01:35:17,627
This is between you and me.

1716
01:35:19,982 --> 01:35:22,277
Man to man.

1717
01:35:27,844 --> 01:35:31,751
You stay on the other side of that fence
until you ready for me.

1718
01:35:33,762 --> 01:35:36,361
Then come and knock on the front door,

1719
01:35:36,362 --> 01:35:40,199
at any time you want.

1720
01:35:52,126 --> 01:35:54,045
I'll be ready for you!

1721
01:36:17,286 --> 01:36:19,491
Thank you. Enjoy the game.

1722
01:36:19,492 --> 01:36:23,295
And going up to bat, with average. 249, destro...

1723
01:36:24,048 --> 01:36:29,015
It's time to strike out, Arty. Prepare...

1724
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:45,051
Rose.

1725
01:36:46,431 --> 01:36:49,374
I'm standing here with my daughter in my arms.

1726
01:36:49,984 --> 01:36:51,406
And...

1727
01:36:52,073 --> 01:36:53,608
She ain't but a...

1728
01:36:53,609 --> 01:36:57,655
wee bitty little old thing.

1729
01:36:57,656 --> 01:36:59,732
She don't know nothing about grownups' business.

1730
01:37:00,362 --> 01:37:01,828
She innocent

1731
01:37:04,118 --> 01:37:05,981
and she ain't got no mama.

1732
01:37:07,979 --> 01:37:10,045
What you telling me for, Troy?

1733
01:37:23,633 --> 01:37:25,105
Well...

1734
01:37:26,850 --> 01:37:29,359
I guess we'll just sit out here on the porch.

1735
01:37:47,659 --> 01:37:50,063
A man's got to do what's right for him.

1736
01:37:53,068 --> 01:37:55,339
I ain't sorry for nothing I done.

1737
01:37:56,928 --> 01:37:59,794
It felt right in my heart.

1738
01:38:02,259 --> 01:38:04,027
What you smiling at?

1739
01:38:07,991 --> 01:38:10,848
Your daddy's a big bad old man.

1740
01:38:12,874 --> 01:38:15,018
Got these great big old hands.

1741
01:38:16,014 --> 01:38:18,106
But sometimes he's scared.

1742
01:38:18,683 --> 01:38:21,308
And right now your daddy's scared

1743
01:38:21,309 --> 01:38:25,856
'cause we sitting out here and ain't got no home.

1744
01:38:26,872 --> 01:38:30,896
Oh, I been homeless before.
I ain't had no little baby with me.

1745
01:38:30,897 --> 01:38:33,614
But I been homeless.

1746
01:38:34,569 --> 01:38:37,568
You just be out on the road by your lonesome

1747
01:38:39,384 --> 01:38:43,684
and you see one of them trains coming by and
you just kinda go like this

1748
01:38:43,685 --> 01:38:48,945
Please, Mr. Engineer, let a man ride the line

1749
01:38:51,946 --> 01:38:57,035
Please, Mr. Engineer, let a man ride the line

1750
01:39:02,350 --> 01:39:04,158
I ain't got no ticket

1751
01:39:04,159 --> 01:39:08,413
please let me ride the blinds.

1752
01:39:13,832 --> 01:39:16,043
She's my daughter, Rose.

1753
01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:20,838
My own flesh and blood.
I can't deny her

1754
01:39:21,796 --> 01:39:24,180
no more than I can deny them boys.

1755
01:39:26,064 --> 01:39:28,522
You and them boys is my family.

1756
01:39:29,587 --> 01:39:32,857
You and them and this child

1757
01:39:32,858 --> 01:39:34,673
is all I got in the world so

1758
01:39:36,888 --> 01:39:39,265
I guess what I'm saying is

1759
01:39:43,793 --> 01:39:46,260
I'd appreciate it

1760
01:39:47,605 --> 01:39:50,060
if you'd help me take care of her.

1761
01:40:01,643 --> 01:40:03,508
Okay, Troy.

1762
01:40:05,456 --> 01:40:07,076
you're right.

1763
01:40:09,345 --> 01:40:11,767
I'll take care of your baby for you

1764
01:40:12,981 --> 01:40:15,027
'cause I gess she...

1765
01:40:17,292 --> 01:40:19,026
she's innocent

1766
01:40:20,213 --> 01:40:23,883
and you can't visit the sins of the father upon the child.

1767
01:40:26,506 --> 01:40:29,342
A motherless child has got a hard time.

1768
01:40:51,878 --> 01:40:54,989
From right now... this child got a mother.

1769
01:41:01,424 --> 01:41:03,903
But you a womanless man.

1770
01:42:14,052 --> 01:42:15,821
I'm coming in and everybody's going out.

1771
01:42:15,822 --> 01:42:18,429
I'm taking this cake down to the church
for the bake sale.

1772
01:42:18,430 --> 01:42:21,427
Lyons was by to see you. He stopped by
to pay you your twenty dollars.

1773
01:42:21,428 --> 01:42:23,662
- It's laying in there on the table.
- Well, here go this money.

1774
01:42:23,663 --> 01:42:25,788
Put it in there on the table, Troy. I'll get it.

1775
01:42:25,789 --> 01:42:27,238
What time you coming back?

1776
01:42:27,239 --> 01:42:29,666
Ain't no use in you studying me. It don't matter
what time I come back.

1777
01:42:29,667 --> 01:42:31,867
I just asked you a question, woman.
can't I ask you a question?

1778
01:42:31,868 --> 01:42:34,429
Troy, I don't want to go into it.
Your food is in there on the stove.

1779
01:42:34,430 --> 01:42:38,480
All you got to do is heat it up. And don't be eating the
rest of them cakes in there.

1780
01:42:38,481 --> 01:42:41,579
I'm coming back for them. We having a bake sale
at the church tomorrow.

1781
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:42,517
- Hey, Troy.
- Hey, what's happening, Bono?

1782
01:43:42,518 --> 01:43:45,355
I just thought I'd stop by to see you.

1783
01:43:45,356 --> 01:43:47,605
Wasn't no one at the house, so I figured

1784
01:43:47,606 --> 01:43:50,749
What you stop by and see me for?
You ain't stopped by in a month of Sundays.

1785
01:43:51,737 --> 01:43:53,884
Hell, I must owe you money or something.

1786
01:43:53,885 --> 01:43:57,030
Since you got your promotion
I can't keep up with you.

1787
01:43:57,031 --> 01:43:59,039
Used to see you every day.

1788
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,150
Now I don't even know what route you working.

1789
01:44:01,151 --> 01:44:05,052
They keep switching me around.
Got me out in Greentree now

1790
01:44:05,053 --> 01:44:06,881
hauling white folks' garbage.

1791
01:44:06,882 --> 01:44:09,720
Greentree, huh? You lucky,

1792
01:44:09,721 --> 01:44:12,069
at least you ain't got to be lifting them barrels.

1793
01:44:12,070 --> 01:44:14,640
Damn if they ain't getting heavier.

1794
01:44:14,641 --> 01:44:17,398
I'm gonna put in my two years and call it quits.

1795
01:44:17,399 --> 01:44:19,390
I'm thinking about retiring myself.

1796
01:44:19,770 --> 01:44:21,703
You got it easy.

1797
01:44:21,704 --> 01:44:24,555
You can drive for another five years.

1798
01:44:25,769 --> 01:44:27,292
It ain't the same, Bono.

1799
01:44:27,293 --> 01:44:29,134
It ain't like working the back of the truck.

1800
01:44:30,338 --> 01:44:34,200
feel like you working by yourself,
nobody to talk to

1801
01:44:35,489 --> 01:44:37,592
I'm thinking about retiring.

1802
01:44:37,593 --> 01:44:39,993
- How's Lucille?
- She all right.

1803
01:44:39,994 --> 01:44:42,864
Her arthritis get to acting up on her sometime.

1804
01:44:42,865 --> 01:44:45,079
Saw Rose on the way here.

1805
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:46,921
She going down to the church, huh?

1806
01:44:46,922 --> 01:44:48,758
Yeah, she took up going down there.

1807
01:44:48,759 --> 01:44:51,863
All them preachers looking for to fatten their pockets.

1808
01:44:52,734 --> 01:44:54,302
Got some gin here.

1809
01:44:54,303 --> 01:44:57,661
Naw, thanks. I just stopped in to say hello.

1810
01:44:57,662 --> 01:44:59,454
Hell, nigger, you can take a drink.

1811
01:44:59,455 --> 01:45:01,751
I ain't never known you to say no to a drink.

1812
01:45:03,909 --> 01:45:07,048
- You ain't got to work tomorrow.
- I just stopped by.

1813
01:45:07,049 --> 01:45:11,508
I'm fixing to go over to Skinner's.
We got us a domino game goingover his house every Friday.

1814
01:45:11,509 --> 01:45:13,009
Nigger, you can't play no dominoes.

1815
01:45:13,010 --> 01:45:15,713
I used to whup you four games out of five.

1816
01:45:15,714 --> 01:45:18,623
Well, that learned me.

1817
01:45:18,624 --> 01:45:20,315
I'm getting better.

1818
01:45:20,926 --> 01:45:22,587
Yeah? Well,

1819
01:45:28,893 --> 01:45:30,751
that's all right.

1820
01:45:32,404 --> 01:45:36,712
Look here, I got to be getting on.

1821
01:45:36,713 --> 01:45:38,709
- Stop by sometime, huh?
- Yeah, I'll do that, Bono.

1822
01:45:40,528 --> 01:45:43,018
Lucille told Rose

1823
01:45:43,019 --> 01:45:45,435
you got her a new refrigerator.

1824
01:45:45,436 --> 01:45:49,997
Yeah, Rose told Lucille you had finally built
your fence

1825
01:45:49,998 --> 01:45:52,402
so I figured we'd call it even.

1826
01:45:52,403 --> 01:45:53,821
I knew you would.

1827
01:45:54,433 --> 01:45:55,754
Yeah.

1828
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:59,023
Okay.

1829
01:46:00,076 --> 01:46:03,052
- I'll be talking to you.
- Yeah, good to see you, Bono.

1830
01:46:04,185 --> 01:46:05,733
I'm gonna stop over.

1831
01:46:05,734 --> 01:46:08,037
Yeah. Okay, Troy.

1832
01:46:17,162 --> 01:46:21,845
Hear it ring! Hear it ring!

1833
01:46:27,862 --> 01:46:31,017
Had an old dog his name was Blue.

1834
01:46:34,261 --> 01:46:37,407
You know Blue was mighty true

1835
01:46:43,965 --> 01:46:47,437
You know Blue was a good old dog

1836
01:46:51,005 --> 01:46:54,480
Blue treed a possum in a hollow log

1837
01:47:09,067 --> 01:47:12,352
Old Blue died and I dug his grave

1838
01:47:13,819 --> 01:47:17,272
Let him down with a golden chain

1839
01:47:20,317 --> 01:47:23,400
Every time I hear old Blue bark!

1840
01:47:26,979 --> 01:47:29,816
Blue treed a possum in Noah's Ark!

1841
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,421
I got to get by.

1842
01:47:37,253 --> 01:47:38,850
Say what? What's you say?

1843
01:47:38,851 --> 01:47:40,831
You in my way. I got to get by.

1844
01:47:44,558 --> 01:47:46,630
You got to get by where?

1845
01:47:48,348 --> 01:47:51,445
This is my house. Bought and paid for.

1846
01:47:51,446 --> 01:47:53,127
Took me fifteen years.

1847
01:47:53,128 --> 01:47:56,400
And if you wanna go in my house and
I'm sitting on the steps

1848
01:47:56,401 --> 01:47:58,080
you say excuse me. Like your mama taught you.

1849
01:47:58,081 --> 01:48:00,318
- Come on, Pop. I got to get by.
- You just gonna walk over top of me?

1850
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:01,694
I live here too!

1851
01:48:02,392 --> 01:48:04,572
You just gonna walk over top of me
in my own house?

1852
01:48:04,573 --> 01:48:06,226
I ain't scared of you.

1853
01:48:06,227 --> 01:48:07,893
I ain't asked if you was scared of me.

1854
01:48:07,894 --> 01:48:10,712
I asked you if you was fixing to walk over top of me
in my own house?

1855
01:48:10,713 --> 01:48:14,242
That's the question. You ain't gonna say excuse me?
You just gonna walk over top of me?

1856
01:48:14,243 --> 01:48:16,561
- If you wanna put it like that.
- How else am I gonna put it?

1857
01:48:16,562 --> 01:48:18,633
I was walking by you to go into the house

1858
01:48:18,634 --> 01:48:21,110
'cause you sitting on the steps drunk, singing to yourself.
You can put it like that.

1859
01:48:21,111 --> 01:48:22,783
Without saying excuse me?

1860
01:48:27,337 --> 01:48:29,086
I asked you a question.

1861
01:48:29,087 --> 01:48:30,687
Without saying excuse me?

1862
01:48:30,688 --> 01:48:33,263
I ain't got to say excuse me to you.
You don't count around here no more.

1863
01:48:36,177 --> 01:48:38,253
Oh, I see, I don't count around here no more.

1864
01:48:38,254 --> 01:48:39,797
You ain't got to say excuse me to your daddy.

1865
01:48:39,798 --> 01:48:44,593
All of a sudden you done got so grown that
your daddy don't count around here no more

1866
01:48:44,974 --> 01:48:48,234
Around here in his own house and yard
that he done paid for

1867
01:48:48,235 --> 01:48:49,605
with the sweat of his brow.

1868
01:48:49,606 --> 01:48:53,067
You have got so grown that even don't count around.

1869
01:48:53,068 --> 01:48:54,576
Would you gonna take over.

1870
01:48:56,334 --> 01:48:59,399
You gonna take over my house.
You gonna wear my pants.

1871
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:01,672
You gonna go in there and stretch out on my bed.

1872
01:49:02,894 --> 01:49:04,910
You ain't got to say excuse me

1873
01:49:04,911 --> 01:49:07,665
Because your daddy don't count around here no more.
Is that right?

1874
01:49:07,666 --> 01:49:09,056
That's right.

1875
01:49:09,057 --> 01:49:11,756
You always talking this dumb stuff.
Now, why don't you just get out my way.

1876
01:49:11,757 --> 01:49:13,570
I guess you got someplace to sleep,

1877
01:49:14,342 --> 01:49:16,116
something to put in your belly.

1878
01:49:16,853 --> 01:49:18,379
You got that, huh?

1879
01:49:20,467 --> 01:49:22,084
'Cause that's what you need.

1880
01:49:22,711 --> 01:49:24,065
You got that?

1881
01:49:25,263 --> 01:49:27,800
You don't know what I got.
You ain't got to worry about what I got.

1882
01:49:27,801 --> 01:49:29,291
You right!

1883
01:49:29,646 --> 01:49:31,745
You one hundred percent right!

1884
01:49:31,746 --> 01:49:35,386
I done spent the last seventeen years
worrying about what you got.

1885
01:49:35,387 --> 01:49:37,175
Now it's your turn.

1886
01:49:37,639 --> 01:49:39,102
I'll tell you what to do.

1887
01:49:40,195 --> 01:49:43,066
You grown, we done established that.

1888
01:49:43,584 --> 01:49:46,419
You a man. Now, let's see you act like one.

1889
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:48,443
Turn your behind around and walk out this yard.

1890
01:49:48,444 --> 01:49:51,597
And when you get out there in the alley
you can forget about this house. See?

1891
01:49:51,598 --> 01:49:53,011
'Cause this is my house.

1892
01:49:53,012 --> 01:49:55,796
You go on and be a man and get your own house.

1893
01:49:55,797 --> 01:49:57,992
You can forget about this. 'Cause this is mine.

1894
01:49:57,993 --> 01:50:00,736
You go on and get yours,
'cause I'm through with doing for you.

1895
01:50:00,737 --> 01:50:02,660
You talking about what you did for me,
what'd you ever give me?

1896
01:50:02,661 --> 01:50:06,477
Them feet, them bones! That pumping heart, nigger!

1897
01:50:07,245 --> 01:50:09,404
I give you more than anybody else is
ever gonna give you.

1898
01:50:09,405 --> 01:50:11,012
You ain't never gave me nothing!

1899
01:50:11,539 --> 01:50:14,698
You ain't never done nothing but hold me back.
Afraid I was gonna be better than you.

1900
01:50:15,922 --> 01:50:18,359
All you ever did was try and make me scared of you.

1901
01:50:19,282 --> 01:50:21,441
I used to tremble every time you called my name.

1902
01:50:21,442 --> 01:50:23,447
Every time I heard your footsteps in the house.

1903
01:50:24,047 --> 01:50:26,378
Wondering all the time,
what's Papa gonna say if I do this?

1904
01:50:26,379 --> 01:50:29,393
What's he gonna say if I do that?
What's Papa gonna say if I turn on the radio?

1905
01:50:29,394 --> 01:50:31,093
And Mama, too she tries but she's scared of you.

1906
01:50:31,094 --> 01:50:33,904
- You leave your mama out of this. Your mama ain't got nothing...
- I don't know how she stand you after what you did to her.

1907
01:50:33,905 --> 01:50:36,492
- I told you to leave your mama out of this!
- What you gonna do

1908
01:50:36,493 --> 01:50:39,268
give me a whupping? You can't whup me no more.
You're too old.

1909
01:50:39,269 --> 01:50:40,608
You just an old man.

1910
01:50:40,609 --> 01:50:43,689
Nigger! That's what you are!

1911
01:50:46,086 --> 01:50:49,128
You just another nigger on the street to me!

1912
01:50:49,129 --> 01:50:51,651
You crazy! You know that?

1913
01:50:51,652 --> 01:50:54,054
Go on now! Get on away from me!
You got the devil in you.

1914
01:50:54,055 --> 01:50:56,209
You just a crazy old man talking about
I got the devil in me.

1915
01:50:56,210 --> 01:50:59,232
Yeah, I'm crazy! If you don't get the hell out my yard

1916
01:50:59,233 --> 01:51:01,434
I'm gonna show you how crazy I am!

1917
01:51:01,435 --> 01:51:03,187
Now, go on, get the hell out of my yard.

1918
01:51:03,188 --> 01:51:04,522
It ain't your yard.

1919
01:51:04,523 --> 01:51:07,528
You took Uncle Gabe's money he got from the Army
to buy this house and then you put him out.

1920
01:51:07,529 --> 01:51:10,077
Get your black ass out of my yard!

1921
01:51:10,078 --> 01:51:11,541
I ain't going nowhere!

1922
01:51:11,542 --> 01:51:13,364
Come on, put me out! I ain't scared of you.

1923
01:51:15,194 --> 01:51:16,884
- That's my bat!
- Come on!

1924
01:51:16,885 --> 01:51:18,964
- Put my bat down!
- Come on, put me out!

1925
01:51:19,548 --> 01:51:22,138
What's the matter? You so bad. Put me out!

1926
01:51:22,139 --> 01:51:23,824
You're gonna have to use it!

1927
01:51:25,864 --> 01:51:28,962
You wanna draw that bat back on me,
you're gonna have to use it.

1928
01:51:28,963 --> 01:51:30,267
Come on!

1929
01:51:30,944 --> 01:51:32,495
Come on!

1930
01:51:32,496 --> 01:51:34,093
You're gonna have to kill me!

1931
01:51:34,732 --> 01:51:37,650
You wanna draw that bat back on me.

1932
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:41,313
You're gonna have to kill me.

1933
01:51:42,145 --> 01:51:43,506
Come on!

1934
01:51:50,422 --> 01:51:51,768
Come on!

1935
01:51:52,478 --> 01:51:54,521
Then I'll show you.

1936
01:51:54,522 --> 01:51:55,978
Come on!

1937
01:52:34,690 --> 01:52:36,639
Go on and get away from around my house.

1938
01:52:46,740 --> 01:52:48,168
Go.

1939
01:52:48,789 --> 01:52:50,427
Tell Mama I'll be back for my things.

1940
01:52:50,428 --> 01:52:52,820
They'll be on the other side of that fence!

1941
01:53:05,615 --> 01:53:07,588
I can't taste nothing.

1942
01:53:18,081 --> 01:53:20,141
I can't taste nothing.

1943
01:53:23,618 --> 01:53:27,553
Hallelujah!

1944
01:53:29,459 --> 01:53:31,343
Hallelujah...

1945
01:53:41,615 --> 01:53:43,295
Hallelujah.

1946
01:53:46,011 --> 01:53:48,196
I can't taste nothing no more.

1947
01:53:55,737 --> 01:53:57,364
Come on!

1948
01:53:58,530 --> 01:54:00,449
It's between you and me now.

1949
01:54:01,647 --> 01:54:03,050
Come on!

1950
01:54:03,674 --> 01:54:05,505
Any time you want.

1951
01:54:06,273 --> 01:54:07,689
Come on!

1952
01:54:07,690 --> 01:54:09,909
I be ready for you

1953
01:54:11,424 --> 01:54:14,005
but I ain't gonna be easy.

1954
01:54:26,778 --> 01:54:29,184
- Raynell!
- Ma'am?

1955
01:54:29,185 --> 01:54:31,141
- What you doing?
- Nothing.

1956
01:54:31,142 --> 01:54:33,309
Girl, get in here and get dressed.
What you doing?

1957
01:54:33,864 --> 01:54:35,802
Seeing if my garden growed.

1958
01:54:35,803 --> 01:54:38,477
I told you it ain't gonna grow overnight.
You got to wait.

1959
01:54:38,478 --> 01:54:42,109
It don't look like it never gonna grow mama. Dag!

1960
01:54:42,110 --> 01:54:44,439
I told you a watched pot never boils.

1961
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:46,285
This ain't even no pot, Mama.

1962
01:54:46,286 --> 01:54:49,461
Get in here and get dressed. This ain't no morning
to be playing around. You hear me?

1963
01:54:49,847 --> 01:54:51,198
Yes, ma'am.

1964
01:54:53,703 --> 01:54:55,206
Bad garden.

1965
01:55:17,152 --> 01:55:18,485
Hi.

1966
01:55:19,142 --> 01:55:20,917
I bet your name is Raynell.

1967
01:55:23,188 --> 01:55:24,838
Is your mama home?

1968
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:28,747
Mama, there's some man down here.

1969
01:55:28,748 --> 01:55:30,392
Mama?

1970
01:55:30,393 --> 01:55:32,003
Cory?

1971
01:55:34,367 --> 01:55:35,954
Cory!

1972
01:55:35,955 --> 01:55:38,597
Cory! Cory!

1973
01:55:39,829 --> 01:55:42,432
Lord have mercy!

1974
01:55:46,201 --> 01:55:48,002
Look here, you all!

1975
01:55:49,726 --> 01:55:52,506
Aw, looka here...

1976
01:55:53,446 --> 01:55:56,541
- Done got all grown up!
- Don't cry, Mama. What you crying about?

1977
01:55:56,542 --> 01:55:58,615
I'm just so glad you made it.

1978
01:55:59,392 --> 01:56:01,436
Hey, Lyons. How you doing, Mr. Bono.

1979
01:56:01,437 --> 01:56:03,296
Look at you, man. Look at you.

1980
01:56:03,297 --> 01:56:06,253
Don't he look good, Rose. Got them corporal stripes.

1981
01:56:06,254 --> 01:56:07,841
What took you so long?

1982
01:56:07,842 --> 01:56:11,766
You know how the Marines are, Mama. They got to get all their
paperwork straight before they let you do anything.

1983
01:56:11,767 --> 01:56:13,913
Well, I'm sure glad you made it.

1984
01:56:13,914 --> 01:56:16,686
They let Lyons come.
Your Uncle Gabe's still in the hospital.

1985
01:56:16,687 --> 01:56:18,583
They don't know if they gonna let him out or not.

1986
01:56:18,584 --> 01:56:20,198
I talked to them a little while ago.

1987
01:56:20,199 --> 01:56:22,541
A corporal in the United States Marines.

1988
01:56:22,542 --> 01:56:24,945
Your daddy knew you had it in you.

1989
01:56:24,946 --> 01:56:27,045
He used to tell me all the time.

1990
01:56:27,046 --> 01:56:28,899
Don't he look good, Mr. Bono?

1991
01:56:28,900 --> 01:56:32,366
Yeah, he remind me of Troy when I first met him.

1992
01:56:33,324 --> 01:56:37,506
Say, Rose, Lucille's down at the church with the choir.

1993
01:56:37,507 --> 01:56:39,577
I'm gonna go down and get the pallbearers lined up.

1994
01:56:39,578 --> 01:56:42,333
- I'll be back to get you all.
- Thanks, Jim.

1995
01:56:42,334 --> 01:56:43,638
See you, Mr. Bono.

1996
01:56:46,981 --> 01:56:50,477
Cory, look at Raynell.

1997
01:56:50,478 --> 01:56:53,211
Ain't she precious?
She gonna break a whole lot of hearts.

1998
01:56:53,212 --> 01:56:55,292
Say hello to your brother.
This is your brother, Cory.

1999
01:56:55,293 --> 01:56:56,910
- You remember Cory.
- No, ma'am.

2000
01:56:56,911 --> 01:56:58,757
She don't remember me, Mama.

2001
01:56:58,758 --> 01:57:01,147
Well, we talk about you. She heard us talk about you.

2002
01:57:01,508 --> 01:57:03,474
This is your brother, Cory, say hello.

2003
01:57:03,814 --> 01:57:05,754
- Hi.
- Hi.

2004
01:57:05,755 --> 01:57:07,322
So you're Raynell

2005
01:57:08,046 --> 01:57:09,767
Mama told me a lot about you.

2006
01:57:10,369 --> 01:57:13,111
C'mon and let me fix you some breakfast.
Keep up your strength.

2007
01:57:13,112 --> 01:57:15,542
- I ain't hungry, Mama.
- You can fix me something, Rose.

2008
01:57:15,543 --> 01:57:16,866
I'll be there in a minute.

2009
01:57:16,867 --> 01:57:19,967
Cory, You sure you don't want nothing.
I know they ain't feeding you right.

2010
01:57:19,968 --> 01:57:22,712
No, Mama, thanks. I don't feel like eating.
I'll get something later.

2011
01:57:23,836 --> 01:57:26,719
Raynell, get up and get that dress on like I told you.

2012
01:57:37,775 --> 01:57:40,917
I always knew you was gonna make
something out yourself.

2013
01:57:42,481 --> 01:57:45,199
Your head was always in the right direction.

2014
01:57:47,746 --> 01:57:49,370
So...

2015
01:57:50,729 --> 01:57:52,365
you gonna stay in

2016
01:57:52,715 --> 01:57:55,199
make it a career, put in your twenty years?

2017
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:56,731
I don't know.

2018
01:57:57,201 --> 01:57:59,015
I got six already, I think that's enough.

2019
01:57:59,016 --> 01:58:01,745
Stick with Uncle Sam and retire early.

2020
01:58:02,768 --> 01:58:04,501
Ain't nothing out here.

2021
01:58:06,052 --> 01:58:09,022
I guess Rose told you what happened with me.

2022
01:58:11,263 --> 01:58:13,503
They got me down the workhouse.

2023
01:58:14,088 --> 01:58:17,521
I thought I was being slick cashing other people's checks.

2024
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:20,090
How much time you doing?

2025
01:58:20,944 --> 01:58:22,883
They give me three years.

2026
01:58:23,604 --> 01:58:26,751
I got that beat now.
I ain't got but nine more months.

2027
01:58:31,646 --> 01:58:33,598
It ain't so bad.

2028
01:58:34,442 --> 01:58:36,924
You learn to deal with it like anything else.

2029
01:58:39,537 --> 01:58:42,000
You got to take the crookeds with the straights.

2030
01:58:42,001 --> 01:58:43,684
That's what Papa used to say.

2031
01:58:45,003 --> 01:58:47,394
He used to say that when he struck out.

2032
01:58:48,631 --> 01:58:51,300
I seen him strike out three times in a row

2033
01:58:51,301 --> 01:58:54,575
and the next time up he hit the ball over the grandstand.

2034
01:58:55,374 --> 01:58:57,672
Right out there in Homestead Field.

2035
01:58:58,772 --> 01:59:01,048
He wasn't satisfied hitting in the seats

2036
01:59:01,049 --> 01:59:02,985
he wanted to hit it over everything!

2037
01:59:04,429 --> 01:59:06,257
After the game,

2038
01:59:07,407 --> 01:59:12,102
he had two hundred people standing around
waiting to shake his hand.

2039
01:59:14,871 --> 01:59:18,109
You got to take the crookeds with the straights.

2040
01:59:21,659 --> 01:59:23,647
Yeah, Papa was something else.

2041
01:59:24,506 --> 01:59:26,295
You still playing?

2042
01:59:26,989 --> 01:59:28,981
Cory, you know I'm gonna do that.

2043
01:59:29,664 --> 01:59:32,091
We got some fellows down there, we got us a band

2044
01:59:32,092 --> 01:59:35,982
we gonna try and stay together when we get out but...
Yeah.

2045
01:59:37,344 --> 01:59:39,473
I'm still playing.

2046
01:59:40,039 --> 01:59:42,059
Still help, something get out the bed in the morning.

2047
01:59:42,060 --> 01:59:44,031
As long as it do that I'm...

2048
01:59:44,032 --> 01:59:46,361
stick with the try to make some sense out of it.

2049
01:59:46,362 --> 01:59:48,838
Lyons, I got these eggs in the pan.

2050
01:59:51,445 --> 01:59:55,590
Let me go on and get these eggs, man.
Get ready to go bury Papa.

2051
02:00:01,486 --> 02:00:03,107
How you doing?

2052
02:00:04,303 --> 02:00:06,064
You doing all right?

2053
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:26,211
- Hi.
- Hi.

2054
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:29,676
Did you used to sleep in my room?

2055
02:00:30,392 --> 02:00:32,489
Yeah, that used to be my room.

2056
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,718
That's what Papa call it.

2057
02:00:34,719 --> 02:00:36,452
"Cory's room."

2058
02:00:38,168 --> 02:00:40,363
It got your football in the closet.

2059
02:00:40,364 --> 02:00:43,543
Raynell, get up there and get them good shoes on!

2060
02:00:43,544 --> 02:00:46,070
Mama, can't I wear these?
Them other one hurt my feet.

2061
02:00:46,071 --> 02:00:47,856
Well, they just gonna have to hurt
your feet for a while.

2062
02:00:47,857 --> 02:00:50,525
You ain't said they hurt your feet when
you went down to the store and got them.

2063
02:00:50,526 --> 02:00:52,658
They didn't hurt then. My feet done got bigger.

2064
02:00:52,659 --> 02:00:54,220
Don't you give me no back talk now.

2065
02:00:54,221 --> 02:00:56,588
You get up there and get them shoes on.

2066
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:06,600
Ain't too much changed.

2067
02:02:07,507 --> 02:02:10,215
He still got that rag tied to that tree.

2068
02:02:13,385 --> 02:02:15,584
He was out here swinging that bat.

2069
02:02:16,934 --> 02:02:19,958
I was just get ready to go back in the house.

2070
02:02:20,992 --> 02:02:24,132
He swung that bat and then he just fell over.

2071
02:02:26,276 --> 02:02:30,397
Seem like when he swung it, he stood there
with this grin on his face

2072
02:02:36,099 --> 02:02:38,125
and then he just fell...

2073
02:02:40,575 --> 02:02:44,422
They carried him on down to the hospital
but I knew there wasn't no need

2074
02:02:46,965 --> 02:02:49,682
- why don't you come on in the house.
- Mama, I got something to tell you.

2075
02:02:51,908 --> 02:02:54,566
I don't know how to tell you this
but I've got to tell you.

2076
02:02:55,159 --> 02:02:57,174
I'm not going to Papa's funeral.

2077
02:02:59,506 --> 02:03:01,151
Boy...

2078
02:03:01,152 --> 02:03:03,275
hush your mouth.

2079
02:03:03,276 --> 02:03:05,908
That's your daddy you talking about.

2080
02:03:05,909 --> 02:03:07,763
I don't want hear that kind of talk this morning.

2081
02:03:07,764 --> 02:03:09,483
I done raised you to come to this?

2082
02:03:09,484 --> 02:03:12,930
You standing there all healthy and grown talking
about you ain't going to your daddy's funeral?

2083
02:03:12,931 --> 02:03:14,921
- Mama, listen...
- I don't want to hear it, Cory.

2084
02:03:14,922 --> 02:03:16,565
You just get that thought out of your head.

2085
02:03:16,566 --> 02:03:19,121
I've got to say no to him. One time in my life
I've got to say no.

2086
02:03:19,122 --> 02:03:20,784
Don't nobody have to listen to nothing like that.

2087
02:03:20,785 --> 02:03:22,567
I know you and your daddy ain't seen eye to eye,

2088
02:03:22,568 --> 02:03:25,002
but I ain't gotta listen to that kind of talk
this morning.

2089
02:03:25,793 --> 02:03:28,589
Disrespecting your daddy
ain't gonna make you a man, Cory.

2090
02:03:28,590 --> 02:03:30,446
You got to find a way to come to that on your own.

2091
02:03:30,447 --> 02:03:33,087
Not going to your daddy's funeral
ain't gonna make you a man.

2092
02:03:35,656 --> 02:03:38,693
The whole time I was growing up living in his house

2093
02:03:38,694 --> 02:03:41,630
Papa was like a shadow that followed you everywhere.

2094
02:03:42,277 --> 02:03:45,433
It weighed on you and sunk into your flesh.

2095
02:03:46,238 --> 02:03:47,913
It would wrap around you and lay there until

2096
02:03:47,914 --> 02:03:50,580
you couldn't tell which one was you anymore.

2097
02:03:51,064 --> 02:03:54,625
That shadow's digging in to your flesh.

2098
02:03:55,136 --> 02:03:57,694
Trying to crawl in. Trying to live through you.

2099
02:03:58,185 --> 02:04:02,158
Everywhere I looked, I saw Troy Maxson
staring right back at me.

2100
02:04:03,094 --> 02:04:05,410
Under the bed, in the closet...

2101
02:04:06,550 --> 02:04:09,785
I'm just saying I gotta find a way to get rid of
that shadow, mama.

2102
02:04:09,786 --> 02:04:12,888
- You just like him. You got him in you good.
- Don't tell me that, Mom.

2103
02:04:12,889 --> 02:04:16,590
- You Troy Maxson all over again.
- I don't wanna be Troy Maxson!

2104
02:04:18,373 --> 02:04:19,783
I just want to be me.

2105
02:04:19,784 --> 02:04:22,279
You can't be nobody but who you are, Cory.

2106
02:04:23,076 --> 02:04:25,895
That shadow wasn't nothing but you
growing into yourself.

2107
02:04:25,896 --> 02:04:28,360
You either got to grow into it or
cut it down to fit you.

2108
02:04:28,361 --> 02:04:30,384
But that's all you got to make life with.

2109
02:04:30,385 --> 02:04:34,196
That's all you got to measure yourself
against that world out there.

2110
02:04:35,402 --> 02:04:38,300
Your daddy wanted you to be
everything he wasn't

2111
02:04:38,301 --> 02:04:42,846
and at the same time he wanted you to be
everything he was.

2112
02:04:43,326 --> 02:04:46,420
I don't know if he was right or wrong,
but I do know

2113
02:04:46,421 --> 02:04:49,148
he meant to do more good than
he meant to do harm.

2114
02:04:51,198 --> 02:04:53,850
Sometimes when he touched he bruised.

2115
02:04:54,607 --> 02:04:57,889
And sometimes when he took me in his arms he cut.

2116
02:05:04,770 --> 02:05:09,639
When I first met your daddy I thought,

2117
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:13,194
"Here is a man I can lay down with and make a baby."

2118
02:05:16,275 --> 02:05:19,022
That's the first thing I thought when I seen him

2119
02:05:19,023 --> 02:05:22,080
I thought, "Rose Lee,

2120
02:05:22,081 --> 02:05:24,564
here is a man that you can open yourself up

2121
02:05:24,565 --> 02:05:26,829
to and be filled to bursting.

2122
02:05:28,193 --> 02:05:30,529
Here is a man,

2123
02:05:30,530 --> 02:05:33,333
that can fill all them empty spaces

2124
02:05:33,334 --> 02:05:35,639
you been tipping around the edges of."

2125
02:05:40,761 --> 02:05:43,509
When your daddy walked through the house

2126
02:05:44,082 --> 02:05:45,894
he was just...

2127
02:05:46,538 --> 02:05:49,240
...so big,

2128
02:05:50,820 --> 02:05:52,616
he filled it up.

2129
02:05:55,090 --> 02:05:57,194
That was my first mistake.

2130
02:05:57,767 --> 02:06:00,483
Not to make him leave some room for me.

2131
02:06:00,742 --> 02:06:02,256
But...

2132
02:06:04,728 --> 02:06:07,611
I wanted a house that I could sing in,

2133
02:06:08,706 --> 02:06:11,090
and that's what your daddy gave me.

2134
02:06:12,154 --> 02:06:14,006
I didn't know to keep up his strength

2135
02:06:14,007 --> 02:06:16,325
I had to give up little pieces of mine.

2136
02:06:17,913 --> 02:06:20,746
I took on his life as mine

2137
02:06:20,747 --> 02:06:22,065
and mixed up the pieces

2138
02:06:22,066 --> 02:06:24,200
so that you couldn't hardly tell
which was which.

2139
02:06:27,078 --> 02:06:30,437
It was my choice, my life

2140
02:06:30,438 --> 02:06:34,592
and I didn't have to live it like that. But that's

2141
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:39,377
what life offered me in the way of being a woman
and I took it.

2142
02:06:41,229 --> 02:06:43,507
I grabbed hold of it with both hands.

2143
02:06:44,264 --> 02:06:47,169
By the time Raynell came into the house

2144
02:06:52,435 --> 02:06:54,968
I didn't want to make my blessing off

2145
02:06:54,969 --> 02:06:56,527
of nobody's misfortune, but

2146
02:06:58,254 --> 02:07:01,430
I took on to Raynell like she was

2147
02:07:01,431 --> 02:07:04,799
all them babies I had wanted and never had.

2148
02:07:06,903 --> 02:07:10,088
Like I'd been blessed to relive a part of my life.

2149
02:07:12,975 --> 02:07:16,232
And if the Lord see fit to keep up my strength

2150
02:07:18,061 --> 02:07:22,545
I'm gonna do her exactly how your daddy did you

2151
02:07:25,879 --> 02:07:28,973
I'm gonna give her the best of what's in me.

2152
02:07:38,563 --> 02:07:41,890
Mama, Reverend Tolliver on the phone.

2153
02:08:00,058 --> 02:08:01,593
Hi.

2154
02:08:03,342 --> 02:08:04,745
Hi.

2155
02:08:04,746 --> 02:08:08,590
- You in the Army or the Marines?
- Marines.

2156
02:08:09,655 --> 02:08:11,810
Papa said it was the Army.

2157
02:08:11,811 --> 02:08:14,942
- Did you know Blue?
- Blue? Who's Blue?

2158
02:08:14,943 --> 02:08:17,366
Papa's dog what he sing about all the time.

2159
02:08:19,675 --> 02:08:22,521
Hear it ring! Hear it ring!

2160
02:08:23,974 --> 02:08:26,585
I had a dog his name was Blue

2161
02:08:27,630 --> 02:08:29,768
Blue was mighty true

2162
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:32,885
You know Blue was a good old dog

2163
02:08:33,986 --> 02:08:36,613
Blue treed a possum in a hollow log

2164
02:08:37,220 --> 02:08:39,106
From that you know he was a good old dog.

2165
02:08:39,107 --> 02:08:41,708
Hear it ring! Hear it ring!

2166
02:08:42,081 --> 02:08:44,767
Blue treed a possum out on a limb

2167
02:08:44,768 --> 02:08:47,235
Blue looked at me and I looked at him

2168
02:08:47,236 --> 02:08:49,793
Grabbed that possum and put him in a sack

2169
02:08:49,794 --> 02:08:52,293
Blue stayed there till I came back

2170
02:08:52,294 --> 02:08:54,878
Old Blue's feets was big and round

2171
02:08:54,879 --> 02:08:57,378
Never allowed a possum to touch the ground.

2172
02:08:57,379 --> 02:08:59,989
Old Blue died and I dug his grave

2173
02:08:59,990 --> 02:09:02,551
I dug his grave with a silver spade

2174
02:09:02,552 --> 02:09:05,100
Let him down with a golden chain

2175
02:09:05,101 --> 02:09:07,449
And every night I call his name

2176
02:09:07,450 --> 02:09:10,565
Go on Blue, you good dog you, come on!

2177
02:09:10,566 --> 02:09:13,048
Go on Blue, you good dog you

2178
02:09:13,049 --> 02:09:15,621
Blue laid down and died like a man

2179
02:09:15,622 --> 02:09:17,985
Blue laid down and died...

2180
02:09:18,565 --> 02:09:22,875
Blue laid down and died like a man

2181
02:09:23,735 --> 02:09:26,546
Now he's treeing possums in the Promised Land.

2182
02:09:27,330 --> 02:09:30,085
I'm gonna tell you this to let you know

2183
02:09:30,086 --> 02:09:32,809
Blue's gone where the good dogs go.

2184
02:09:34,497 --> 02:09:38,380
Blue's gone where the good dogs go.

2185
02:09:41,307 --> 02:09:43,716
Cory, we're getting ready to leave now.

2186
02:09:48,712 --> 02:09:50,996
Go...

2187
02:09:51,154 --> 02:09:53,706
go upstairs and put your shoes on
like mama told you

2188
02:09:53,707 --> 02:09:56,264
so we can get ready to go to Papa's funeral.

2189
02:09:57,543 --> 02:10:00,360
Okay, I'll be back.

2190
02:10:14,054 --> 02:10:17,030
Hey, Rose!

2191
02:10:17,031 --> 02:10:19,576
I'm here, Rose. Hey Rose, I'm here.

2192
02:10:19,577 --> 02:10:21,386
Look here, Lyons!

2193
02:10:21,387 --> 02:10:23,655
See, I told you, Rose, I told you they'd
let him come.

2194
02:10:23,656 --> 02:10:26,002
- How you doing, Uncle Gabe?
- How you doing, Uncle Gabe?

2195
02:10:26,003 --> 02:10:27,930
Hey, Rose. It's time.

2196
02:10:27,931 --> 02:10:30,960
It's time to tell Saint Peter to open the Gates.

2197
02:10:34,388 --> 02:10:36,255
You ready, Troy.

2198
02:10:36,256 --> 02:10:37,993
Troy, you ready?

2199
02:10:37,994 --> 02:10:41,301
I'm gonna tell Saint Peter to open the Gates.

2200
02:10:41,302 --> 02:10:43,569
You get ready now.

2201
02:11:01,580 --> 02:11:04,413
Let me go!

2202
02:11:13,743 --> 02:11:17,173
Troy... Troy!

2203
02:12:14,002 --> 02:12:16,374
That's the way that go!

2204
02:12:58,541 --> 02:13:02,845
