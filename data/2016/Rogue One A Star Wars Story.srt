There's an Imperial defector
in Jedha. A pilot.

219
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,353
He's been held by Saw Gerrera.

220
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,433
He's claiming the Emperor
is creating a weapon

221
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,717
with the power to destroy entire planets.

222
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,189

this weapon before it is finished.

224

Captain Andor's mission is to
authenticate the pilot's story.

225
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,200
And then, if possible, find your father.

It appears he is critical to the
development of this super weapon.

227

we're hoping that he will
help us locate your father

to the Senate for testimony.

I knew you were safe.

540
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,318
You left me behind.

541
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,796
You were already
the best soldier in my cadre.

542
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,838
- I was 16!
- I was protecting you!

543
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,956
You dumped me!

544
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,192
You were the daughter of
an Imperial science officer.

545
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,436
People were starting to figure that out.

546
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,397

555
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,475
The pilot.

556
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,995
The message.

557
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,156
All of it.

561
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,359

562
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,872
There's not much of me left.

563

The Alliance wants my father.

564
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,350
They think he sent you
a message about a weapon.

565
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,150
I guess they think by sending me,
you might actually help them out.

566
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,033
So what is it that you want, Jyn?

567
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,196

they've got it.

572
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,959

you're calling yourself these days...

620

then perhaps there's a chance
to save the Alliance.

621
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,677
Perhaps there's a chance
to explain myself...

622
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,917
and, though I don't dare
hope for too much...

623

to let her know that my love
for her has never faded...

626
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,237
and how desperately I've missed her.

00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,151
Jyn, my Stardust...

629
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,155
I can't imagine what you think of me.

630
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,070
When I was taken,
I faced some bitter truths.

631
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,033
I was told that soon enough

632
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,873
Krennic would have you as well.

633
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,150
As time went by...

634
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,277
I knew that you were either dead...

635
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,750
or so well hidden that
he would never find you.

636
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,279
I knew if I had refused to work,
if I took my own life...

637
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,591
it would only be a matter of time
before Krennic realized...

638
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,116
he no longer needed me
to complete the project.

639
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,715
So I did the one thing nobody expected.

640
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,876
I lied.

641
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,438
I learned to lie.

642
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,751
I played the part of a beaten man

643
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,672
resigned to the sanctuary of his work.

644
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,633
I made myself indispensable...

645
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,879
and all the while, I laid
the groundwork of my revenge.

646
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,437
We call it the Death Star.

647
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,000
There is no better name...

648
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,591
and the day is coming soon
when it will be unleashed.

649
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,514
I've placed a weakness
deep within the system...

650
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,235
a flaw so small and powerful,
they will never find it.

651
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,470
But, Jyn...

652
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,356
Jyn, if you're listening, my beloved...

653
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,240
so much of my life has been wasted.

654
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,277
I try to think of you only
in the moments when I'm strong...

655
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,114
because the pain of
not having you with me...

656
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,239
your mother, our family.

657
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,437
The pain of that loss
is so overwhelming...

658
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,632
I risk failing even now.

659
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,235
It's just so hard not to think of you.

660
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,998

00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,671
the reactor module, that's the key.

664

That's the place I've laid my trap.

665
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,071
It's well hidden and unstable.

666
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,320
One blast to any part of it
will destroy the entire station.

667
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,354
You'll need the plans...

668

to find the reactor.

I know there's a complete
engineering archive...

670
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,112
in the data vault
at the Citadel Tower on Scarif.

671
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,715
Any pressurized explosion
to the reactor module...

672
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,430
will set off a chain reaction
that will destroy the entire station.
