1
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,768
Quiet. Open the door,
open the door.

2
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,240
What?

3
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,378
What in the devil?

4
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,614
Can you please stand up and take
us to the cash drawer, ma'am?

5
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:29,781
I will not.

6
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,683
We ain't asking.

7
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,785
There's no money
in the drawers yet.

8
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,821
It's in the safe and
I ain't got the code.

9
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,890
Prove it. Drawer!

10
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,192
Here.

11
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,494
Open the drawer.

12
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,929
I need the keys. Keys.

13
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,604
Step back.

14
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,176
Shit. Damn it!

15
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,645
Y'all are new at this,
I'm guessing.

16
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:00,846
Where's the money?

17
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,381
I told you, it's in the safe.

18
00:03:02,383 --> 00:03:03,615
Well, who has the code?

19
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,884
Mr. clauson.

20
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,654
He'll be here soon and I
suggest you fellas don't be.

21
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,557
All you're guilty of right
now is being stupid.

22
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,392
Just leave and
that's all it'll be.

23
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,664
Tell me I'm stupid again.

24
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,337
What time does Mr. clauson get here?
Ma'am, look at me.

25
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,372
What time does
Mr. clauson get here, huh?

26
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,474
8:30 every morning.

27
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,711
We're walking.

28
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,782
And sit.

29
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,617
Where do you think you're going?

30
00:03:38,619 --> 00:03:39,985
Sit on the floor!

31
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,402
You're stupid.

32
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,815
This ain't about you, darling.

33
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,823
Elsie, you all right?

34
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,928
Good morning.

35
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,120
You didn't have to hit him.

36
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:36,508
Whoo!

37
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,096
Slow down. I ain't speeding.

38
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,390
See, little brother,
not a worry in the world.

39
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:54,526
Planning this and doing it
is two different things.

40
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,995
Maybe we should get there
ahead, get up to olney.

41
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,532
Early bird gets the worm.

42
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,574
- Slow down.
- I ain't speeding.

43
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,565
I found these coins in the barn.

44
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,034
Lord knows how long
they've been sitting there.

45
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,370
I've been living
off an inmate's diet,

46
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:39,871
and had all these coins

47
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,441
sitting right underneath
a bunch of feed sacks.

48
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,411
This one says 1953.

49
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,013
1953?

50
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,015
I wonder if any of
these is collector's items.

51
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,850
You could be sitting
on a fortune here.

52
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,052
I hope so.

53
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,821
Good morning, folks.
Open the drawer!

54
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,390
Open the motherfucking drawer!

55
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:01,560
Ones, fives, 10s, 20s,
no hundreds, no bundles.

56
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:02,527
You boys robbing the bank?

57
00:06:02,529 --> 00:12:05,056
Shut up.

58
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,097
Put your hands on the counter.
On the counter.

59
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,432
Yes, sir. That's it, come on.

60
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,035
That's crazy,
y'all ain't even Mexicans.

61
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,503
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

62
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,638
No bundles. Just loose cash.

63
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,940
Okay.

64
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,808
You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

65
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,110
Hands on the counter
where I can see them!

66
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:20,112
Yes, sir.

67
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:21,880
You got a gun on you, old man?

68
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,416
You're damn right
I got a gun on me.

69
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,884
Are you gonna get his gun? Yeah.

70
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,686
Keep up with
the circumstances, okay?

71
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:28,954
Yeah, I got it.

72
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,822
So y'all gonna
steal my gun, too?

73
00:06:30,824 --> 00:13:01,646
I have my own gun.

74
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:34,659
We ain't stealing from you.
We're stealing from the bank.

75
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:37,796
Much obliged.

76
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,433
Let's go!

77
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:42,667
We're sorry about this, folks.

78
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,505
Dirty, rotten sons of bitches.

79
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,809
Fuck you, old man!

80
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:51,977
Go, run, go!

81
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,462
Put the gun on the counter.

82
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:11,596
You trying to get us killed?

83
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,798
I ain't stealing
from some old man.

84
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,966
We're stealing from
one place, that's it.

85
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,501
You're turning out to
be a poor-ass criminal.

86
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:17,836
Oh, fuck you.

87
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,206
Whoo!

88
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,876
See what the early bird gets?

89
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,480
Maybe we should hit
that branch in jayton?

90
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:30,582
No, we ain't. We hit those banks

91
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:31,683
first thing in the fucking
morning, when they're empty.

92
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:32,751
When they're empty, god damn it.

93
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,786
All right.

94
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,557
It's the last time
I care to be shot at.

95
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,659
We got to be smart. We're a
ways from being finished.

96
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:42,661
Shit, I can do this all week.

97
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:43,962
We're gonna.

98
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,664
We're like the comanches,
little brother,

99
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,533
raiding where we please

100
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,203
with the whole of Texas
hunting our shadow.

101
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,506
Lord of the plains.

102
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,542
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

103
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,944
Hands off. Fuck off!

104
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,179
You hear about
these bank robberies?

105
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:45,977
Why are you always
dressed like me?

106
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,754
This is our uniform.

107
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,623
We ain't got no uniform.

108
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,224
You can wear whatever
color shirt you choose.

109
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,260
You just keep choosing mine.

110
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,929
Ranger regs say white,
blue, or tan dress shirts.

111
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,264
Stands to reason
every once in a while

112
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,266
we're gonna be dressed the same.

113
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,235
Well, you know what they say
about imitation, Alberto.

114
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,872
You wanna hear about
these bank robberies,

115
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,341
or you just sit there and let
Alzheimer's run its course.

116
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,776
Where are they at?

117
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,647
Texas Midlands. Branch in Archer
city and the branch in olney.

118
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,315
FBI want an assist?

119
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,951
Midlands ain't got any
branches outside Texas.

120
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,621
Plus, they're just hitting the
drawers for a few thousand.

121
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:23,922
FBI don't want it.

122
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,060
You may get to have some fun

123
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:31,022
before they send you off
to the rocking chair yet.

124
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,652
I need you sober.

125
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,014
Who the hell gets
drunk off a beer?

126
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,427
Place looks like shit.

127
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,129
You got anything
else you wanna say?

128
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,031
There's not a decent steak

129
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:09,000
in the whole lot of them,
the sorry sons of bitches.

130
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,669
Yeah, well, while you
were busy in jail,

131
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,103
I was busy looking after mama,

132
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,271
so you can go fuck yourself.

133
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,251
Was she in that bed a while?

134
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,289
Three months.

135
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,840
The end there was pretty rough.

136
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,779
I could've helped out
a little if she asked.

137
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,416
I could've fed them skinny cows.

138
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:04,089
We had nothing to feed them.

139
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:06,091
Well, I could've helped
clean up the house a bit.

140
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,796
I never took you for the go-to
guy for house cleaning.

141
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:15,066
No. Just robbing banks.

142
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,234
Yeah.

143
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,284
Fuck her. She never wanted
nothing to do with me anyway.

144
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,763
She leave a will?

145
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,234
Yeah.

146
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:51,836
Am I in it?

147
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,778
The will don't matter.

148
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,348
She left everything to me.

149
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,049
By Friday it all
goes to my boys.

150
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,321
She didn't mean nothing by it.

151
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,525
She damn sure meant it.

152
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,460
She always hated me
for standing up to him.

153
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,030
We all got punished.

154
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:21,752
You never understood that fighting
back makes the beating last longer.

155
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,402
No, I understood.

156
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,105
That's why I stopped fighting
and shot that son of a bitch.

157
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:36,074
Hey, what's going on?

158
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,876
Somebody robbed
the bank this morning.

159
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,477
Do what?

160
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,614
If you see anyone looking a
little sideways, give me a call.

161
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:44,549
Sideways don't wanna meet me.

162
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,151
Find itself on the wrong
end of a short rope.

163
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:51,389
Oh, well, that would simplify
things for everyone but you.

164
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,125
Maybe, if you can find the tree.

165
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,631
God, I love west Texas.

166
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,904
Ranger? Hi there.

167
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,006
Wasn't much of a robbery,

168
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,008
got off with just under $7,000.

169
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,310
Took the drawer money,
20s and under,

170
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,078
only loose bills.

171
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,580
No ink pack? Nope.

172
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,515
Smart. That was smart.

173
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:20,018
Can we get a look at the video?

174
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,553
Let me introduce you to the
bank manager, Mr. clauson.

175
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,425
This here is ranger Hamilton.

176
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,060
Ranger. Sir.

177
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,596
Can we get a look at
the surveillance video?

178
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,531
We got cameras,

179
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,266
but they're switching us
over to a digital system

180
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,668
that feeds into the computer.

181
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,437
These new cameras
don't hook to our vcrs.

182
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,372
Call over
the young county sheriffs.

183
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,608
Ask them if they thought
to hook their cameras

184
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,343
to some sort of
recording device.

185
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,214
Armed? Yes, sir. Pistols.

186
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,216
Oh.

187
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,018
Faces covered?

188
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,955
Ski masks, sweatshirts,
baggy pants...

189
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,723
Uh-huh.
Like them thugs in Dallas.

190
00:15:58,725 --> 00:15:59,725
Tweakers maybe?

191
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,693
Maybe.

192
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,629
A little early in the
morning for tweakers.

193
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,032
Tweakers don't sleep.
They just tweak.

194
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:11,402
They rob drug stores
and parked cars, not banks.

195
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,603
Can I take a look inside?

196
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,172
Yes, sir.

197
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,040
Yeah, I'm here, Margaret.

198
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,176
So they bopped you
on the schnozzola, huh?

199
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,178
Yes, sir.

200
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,245
Not very nice.

201
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,716
I know their faces was covered,

202
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,385
but could you tell their race?

203
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,686
Black, white?

204
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,490
Their skin or their souls?

205
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,993
Let's leave their souls
out of this for now.

206
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,562
White.

207
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:41,132
From around here
somewhere is my guess,

208
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:42,567
you know, from their voices.

209
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,268
Oh?

210
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,636
Young county says same deal

211
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:46,504
with the branch in olney.

212
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,605
Excuse me.

213
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,209
Do they have video?

214
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:54,078
Same deal all the way around.

215
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,448
Doesn't Walmart sell all sorts
of electronic equipment?

216
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,285
My word.
Get your hands off that.

217
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:05,723
Well, these boys, they aren't
done yet, I'll tell you that.

218
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,759
How come? Well, they're patient.

219
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,528
Just sticking to the drawers,

220
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,530
not taking the hundreds,
that's the bank's money,

221
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,499
we can trace that.

222
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:17,702
They're trying to raise a certain
amount, that's my guess.

223
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,704
It's gonna take
a few banks to get there.

224
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,786
Your boys know how
rich they're gonna be?

225
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,058
They don't know anything yet.

226
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,394
You take them to the funeral?

227
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:47,705
Like I said, they
don't know anything.

228
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,337
When's the last
time you saw them?

229
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,004
When we all went to the rodeo in
stamford right after you got out.

230
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,451
That was a year ago. I
talk to them on the phone.

231
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:07,718
You talk to them on the phone?

232
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,324
You want a little advice?
No. No, I don't.

233
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,193
Go see them tomorrow.

234
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,300
You got any idea how much I
owe Debbie in child support?

235
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,568
You've got enough
in your front pocket

236
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,869
to fix that problem right now.

237
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,107
We can't spare it,
you know that.

238
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,110
Maybe we should
hit another branch.

239
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,618
You know, you talk like we ain't
gonna get away with this.

240
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,856
I've never met nobody who got
away with anything, ever. You?

241
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,395
Then why in the hell
did you agree to do it?

242
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,532
Because you asked,
little brother.

243
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,208
I got to shit like an old goat.

244
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:06,931
Grab the check,
meet me out front.

245
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,287
Well, if that isn't a hint,

246
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,488
I don't know what is.

247
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,694
You like your steak?

248
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,396
Yes, ma'am.

249
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:28,499
Well, you've got
a ways to go yet.

250
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,769
Yeah, you'll be waiting around
all day for me to finish this.

251
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,905
I'll be here whether you
finish it or not. So...

252
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,641
You take your time.

253
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,484
It sure is quiet in here.

254
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,721
Open the drawer.
Fives, 10s, 20s.

255
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:52,290
Fan them out like
a deck of cards.

256
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,293
What do you do?

257
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,501
Last job was for a...

258
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,769
Natural gas company.

259
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,405
Sounds high-dollar.

260
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,842
No, there ain't nothing
high-dollar about drilling.

261
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,245
No one seems to be
drilling for gas now, anyway.

262
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,614
They sure drilling for oil.

263
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,549
I mean, ain't one drill
the same as the next?

264
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,320
That's my take on it.

265
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,224
I guess, I got to get
someone else to believe me.

266
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,425
Son of a bitch!

267
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,861
We could use a cook.

268
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,501
Just a thought.

269
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,638
Order's up, Jenny Ann.

270
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,511
Bye.

271
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,501
Start the car!

272
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,803
Shit.

273
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,744
Fuck! Shit!

274
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:20,911
Go, go, go!

275
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,066
I bet you don't owe this
much in child support.

276
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:44,108
I must be out of my goddamn
mind to ask you for help.

277
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,873
You wanna get us killed? Huh?

278
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:49,907
That's not a Midlands branch.

279
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,909
That's not part of the plan.

280
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:54,712
Now, we got to go back to the
ranch and bury the car. Fuck!

281
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:56,681
No, we do not. We're over
halfway to Oklahoma.

282
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,015
I'm not driving
a stolen getaway car

283
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,951
to a fucking Indian casino.

284
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,787
You just put us
a goddamn day behind.

285
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,556
Well, I got us a day ahead this
morning, so I guess we're even.

286
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,091
You're welcome. Fuck you.

287
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,069
Can't you answer your own phone?

288
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,806
I'm driving. You're just sitting
there twiddling your fat fingers.

289
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,076
Ranger Hamilton's phone.

290
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,388
It's reckless is what it is.
Oh...

291
00:23:10,390 --> 00:46:20,778
It's tweakers. I'm telling you.

292
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,990
I don't think
these boys is reckless.

293
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,526
Damn sure ain't tweakers.

294
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:17,395
They know exactly
what they're doing.

295
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,664
I don't know how
you're gonna survive

296
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,400
without somebody to outsmart.

297
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,836
You need a hobby, and quick.

298
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,038
How about a horse?

299
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:31,542
Mary Beth was the rider.

300
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,045
A horse would only
remind me of her.

301
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:38,516
You like to fish.

302
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,421
Not enough to do it
every goddamn day.

303
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,690
Yeah, when I retire,

304
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:49,794
I'm gonna move Esme and me
down to galveston.

305
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:51,662
Buy a fishing boat.

306
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:54,198
Gonna live on that son of a
bitch right at the pier.

307
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,000
Oh, who knows?

308
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,136
Maybe one of these bank robbers

309
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,805
is gonna want a gunfight,

310
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:04,809
and I can dodge my retirement
in a Blaze of glory.

311
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:06,844
Well, I've seen you shoot.

312
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:08,546
There won't be much glory in it.

313
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,550
Oh, well, I'm lucky

314
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:15,119
I got a half-breed
by my side to avenge me.

315
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,590
If you can stay
sober long enough.

316
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:22,226
Knowing how you
injuns like the bottle.

317
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,535
Whoa.

318
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,079
Hey. What you all doing?

319
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,848
You burning this field?

320
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,149
Why in the shit
would we do that?

321
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:46,650
This kicked up on the highway,

322
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,185
been chasing us ever since.

323
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:50,154
Wish we could do
something for you.

324
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,255
Ought to just let
it turn me to ashes

325
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:52,623
and put me out of my misery.

326
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:53,757
Cut that fence.

327
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,093
21st century,

328
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,596
I'm racing a fire to the
river with a herd of cattle.

329
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:01,165
And I wonder why my kids won't
do this shit for a living.

330
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,100
Move it. Come on.

331
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,535
Go, go, go.

332
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,907
You wanna call it in?

333
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,243
Oh, it's gonna burn out
when it hits the brazos.

334
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,913
No one to call
around here, anyway.

335
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:18,949
These boys is on their own.

336
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:29,860
I still don't see
the problem, Toby.

337
00:25:29,862 --> 00:50:59,722
You still don't...

338
00:25:29,862 --> 00:50:59,722
Well, the problem is,
thanks to you

339
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:34,131
we have to spend tomorrow
morning getting another car,

340
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,066
so we'll have to hit
two banks on Wednesday.

341
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,968
We already done three today.

342
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,603
Stop worrying.

343
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:43,841
Whose land is this?

344
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,680
Jeremy chalker.

345
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:51,782
He lets me stay here in
exchange for shooting coyotes.

346
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,322
Cold beer in the fridge.

347
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:17,841
You stole my hat.

348
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:19,643
I borrowed it.

349
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:20,725
What the fuck you do to it?

350
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,827
What's this? My livelihood.

351
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,130
We don't need all this.

352
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:42,866
Can't keep the guns
in the trailer days on end.

353
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,348
That's not coming
with us in the bank.

354
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:49,974
Just spoke to the teller.

355
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,308
She's a little shook up.

356
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,710
Perp took her driver's license,

357
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:54,352
threatened her family
if she talked to us.

358
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,650
Mind if I ask you
your name, young lady?

359
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:01,752
Natalie Martinez.

360
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:04,088
Well, Natalie,
I want you to know

361
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,356
we're gonna have some officers

362
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:07,257
watching your house,
extra careful,

363
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,759
till we catch these buggers.

364
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:10,928
You have my word on that.

365
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:11,962
There's more than one?

366
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,733
Only one man robbed the bank?

367
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,801
Yeah. What'd he look like?

368
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:21,672
He was dressed like a cowpoke
except for the ski mask.

369
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:24,908
I think he ran to a car

370
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,244
that was parked out
front of the diner.

371
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,246
You saw the car?

372
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,348
It was green.

373
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,051
How old?
I don't know cars, mister.

374
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:37,921
Well, was it a nice
car or an okay car,

375
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,089
or a real piece of shit?

376
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,359
It was a real piece of shit.

377
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:46,263
All right.
Now, we're getting somewhere.

378
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,899
Oh, that looks like a man who
could foreclose on a house.

379
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:50,367
Excuse me, Natalie.

380
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,236
Excuse me, Mr. banker.

381
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:54,038
Natalie, I'm gonna have
the officer stay with you

382
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,005
till your father
arrives, all right?

383
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,807
Okay.

384
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:57,775
Didn't happen to have
your surveillance cameras

385
00:27:57,777 --> 00:27:59,209
on this morning, did you?

386
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:00,444
Of course.

387
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,346
Oh, so you have
the robbery on video.

388
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:03,747
Of course we do.

389
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:04,948
What kind of bank would we be

390
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,784
if we didn't have
video surveillance?

391
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:09,887
Oh, you'd be
a Texas Midlands bank.

392
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:12,156
All right, we've got video.

393
00:28:12,158 --> 00:28:14,958
Care to give it a watch while I
wander over to the burger joint?

394
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,126
Would you order me something

395
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,327
while you're there?
I'm starving.

396
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,730
I doubt they serve pemmican.

397
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:21,799
You know I'm part Mexican, too.

398
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:23,934
Yeah, well, I'm
gonna get to that

399
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,270
when I'm through
with the Indian insults,

400
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:27,705
but it's gonna be a while.

401
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,710
You rangers are an odd bunch.

402
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:36,880
No, just him. Let's take
a look at that video.

403
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,348
Yeah, it's right back here.

404
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,728
Howdy.

405
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,398
Ma'am. Guess you know about
the goings-on at the bank.

406
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,833
I did notice.

407
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:59,403
Any out-of-towners
come through today?

408
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,506
Jenny Ann waited on a couple
of boys, ain't from here.

409
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:03,941
Oh?

410
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:04,943
I'll go get her.

411
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,844
Appreciate that.

412
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,049
Boys.

413
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:15,085
Y'all been here for a while?

414
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,254
Well, long enough to watch
a bank getting robbed

415
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,290
that's been robbing
me for 30 years.

416
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,452
Oh, you say you've seen them?

417
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,928
I'm pretty sure
they were sitting

418
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,330
right over there having lunch.

419
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,999
One of them was tall.

420
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,235
The other one was short.

421
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,472
They's both lean like cowboys.

422
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:38,142
Looked like brothers
if you ask me.

423
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:39,476
You the Texas ranger?

424
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,513
Yes, ma'am.

425
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:45,482
Tell me about those handsome young
strangers that you waited on.

426
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,418
Who said handsome?

427
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,355
I did.

428
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:54,124
Based on the fact that you didn't
meet me in the parking lot,

429
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,859
hollering about
the two out-of-towners

430
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,961
eating here right
before a bank robbery.

431
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,533
Well, they didn't mention
they was robbing the bank.

432
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:03,535
They pay cash?

433
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,503
That a crime now?

434
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,074
How much did they leave?

435
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,813
How much?

436
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,982
$200.

437
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:22,586
And they left it before
the bank was robbed. So...

438
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,922
Uh, before this bank was robbed.

439
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,192
I'm gonna need
to see them bills.

440
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:34,264
Ma'am. Mmm-mmm.

441
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,368
Ma'am, them bills is evidence.

442
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,004
Mmm-mmm. It's evidence
if they're the bank robbers.

443
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,906
Till then, it's my tip.

444
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,510
And half my mortgage.

445
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,413
So, you go out there and you get a
warrant, and come after the money

446
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:51,735
that I will be using to keep a
roof over my daughter's head.

447
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:59,957
One man hit the bank,
just like she said.

448
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,525
Yeah.
Checkered button-down shirt,

449
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:04,194
jeans, ski mask.
It's on the videotapes.

450
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:07,497
Checkered shirt. That was him.

451
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:13,070
They were sitting right over there.
Tipped her $200.

452
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:18,308
Go wrestle a description from that
big sassy girl in the kitchen.

453
00:31:18,310 --> 01:02:36,618
You didn't get it yourself?

454
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:22,312
Oh, and get that tip from her.
We're gonna check them bills.

455
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:24,948
Good luck.

456
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,550
Yeah, I'd expect
some resistance.

457
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:30,053
Oh, and, Alberto,

458
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:34,591
call that motel on 287,
get us a room.

459
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:35,926
We're gonna stay the night?

460
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:37,248
Well, this is where
the action is.

461
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,564
Seems foolish.

462
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,366
What's that?

463
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:43,567
The days of robbing banks

464
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,535
and trying to live,
spend the money.

465
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,405
They've long gone.

466
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,108
Long gone for sure.

467
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,998
What does Justin want
to do when he's grown?

468
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,657
Right now he's dreaming of
slinging a football for a&m.

469
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,131
He's a lot like you.

470
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:16,366
I bet that puckers your red eye.

471
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:17,368
More than you know.

472
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:23,073
Thirty-nine years of life,

473
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:26,343
10 in jail. If he turns left where
I turned right, he'll be okay.

474
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,361
Yaw.

475
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:48,498
Yaw.

476
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:04,982
You want anything?

477
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,516
Dr. pepper, Winston lights.

478
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:14,024
It's okay. Come on.

479
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,736
What?

480
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,139
What, bitch?

481
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,276
You looking for trouble,
motherfucker?

482
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,213
You came to the right place.

483
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:38,749
Boy, you'd think
there were 10 of me.

484
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:41,451
Oh, yeah?

485
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:47,057
Not so fucking tough now,
are you, bitch?

486
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:03,607
Hey, man, he had it coming.

487
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,042
He had it coming.
He had it coming.

488
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:14,317
You got some spunk left in you.

489
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:17,721
Oh, you remembered the gun!

490
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:19,823
You're getting
to be old hat at this.

491
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,668
Asshole could've killed you.

492
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,337
Ah, not the way it would
have gone, little brother.

493
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,811
Ten of me, I told you.

494
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:44,314
Are you trying to make me mad?

495
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:46,149
I said Dr. pepper,
this is Mr. pibb.

496
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:47,384
That's all they had.

497
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:49,419
Only assholes drink Mr. pibb.

498
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,787
Drink up.

499
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:02,732
Hello.

500
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,122
Now we're talking.

501
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:28,859
The women in this place.

502
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:33,864
What the hell you talking about?

503
00:35:33,866 --> 00:35:35,832
We should get another shot,
they'll be pretty soon enough.

504
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:38,368
Bartender, whiskeys
if you please.

505
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,436
Coming up.

506
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,142
To your boys.

507
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:57,787
Let's go change that money.

508
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:07,731
Sorry. I just sold my car.
This is how the fella paid me.

509
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:09,299
We take it any way
you bring it, mister.

510
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:23,580
Wanna play some poker?

511
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,749
I don't gamble.

512
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:28,885
You can't lose at poker,
not even you.

513
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:30,887
I'm gonna watch the aggie
game and have a beer.

514
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:31,889
Suit yourself.

515
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:35,559
Come on now.

516
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:36,561
Suck a d.

517
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:38,562
Don't lose it all.

518
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:39,896
Eat my a.

519
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:41,865
Fucking asshole.

520
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:42,025
That's, uh, quite a stack.

521
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:53,903
Check?

522
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,338
Don't chase me, chief.

523
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:09,753
You comanche?

524
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,325
Lords of the plains.

525
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,894
Lords of nothing now.

526
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,038
I call.

527
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,042
Show your cards, gentlemen.

528
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,023
Do you know what comanche means?

529
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,695
It means enemies forever.

530
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:53,763
Enemies with who?

531
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,433
Everyone.

532
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:57,555
You know what that makes me?

533
00:38:58,502 --> 00:38:59,703
An enemy.

534
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:00,705
No.

535
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,540
It makes me a comanche.

536
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:14,617
Does he look like you?

537
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:16,686
I see his mom in him,

538
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,622
everybody else sees me.

539
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,125
I don't know.

540
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:28,965
You staying in the hotel?

541
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,137
Yeah.

542
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,576
Take me to your room.

543
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:47,450
Thank you. Just, uh...

544
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:50,687
You know, there's no shame in
needing the touch of a woman.

545
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,058
You need it.

546
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,627
I know you do.

547
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,164
Just let me touch you.

548
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,667
Are you trying to work
my little brother?

549
00:40:04,669 --> 01:20:09,336
No, I wasn't doing
anything, but I'm...

550
00:40:04,669 --> 01:20:09,336
Tanner, she didn't do nothin'.

551
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:08,671
She didn't do nothin'.
But, but, but, but, but...

552
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:10,507
You saw there was
a stack of chips, here.

553
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:11,641
Easy mark? Don't.

554
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,443
Uh... no.

555
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:14,611
What were you gonna do?
Bring him up to his room,

556
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:15,745
call your pimp,

557
00:40:15,747 --> 01:20:31,492
roll him, drug him, what?
No. I...

558
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:18,915
What were you gonna do?
Tanner, don't.

559
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,917
Mind if I sample the goods?
Real...

560
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:24,788
Hands off her. Stop it. Stop it.

561
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:31,661
You're fucking crazy.

562
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:32,796
Call me.

563
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,664
We got a problem here?

564
00:40:34,666 --> 01:21:09,330
It's all good. It's all good.
It's all good.

565
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,467
It's all good.
Just got a little drunk

566
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:38,629
at the bar, sorry about that.

567
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,440
How the fuck have you managed

568
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:44,722
to stay out of prison
for a year?

569
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:46,643
It's been difficult.

570
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,950
Like to pay this out
in cash or check?

571
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,452
Get some Debbie money.

572
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,855
Four in cash, rest in check.

573
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:02,158
Who would you like
the check made out to?

574
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,695
Texas Midlands bank.

575
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,472
Thank you much.

576
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,608
Let's go get a room.

577
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,121
Welcome to the comanche 66.
Do you have a reservation?

578
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:33,156
We do not.

579
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:38,761
Good lord, look at you.

580
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:41,097
We would be obliged if you
would provide accommodations,

581
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,700
though we failed to call ahead.

582
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:45,602
Boy, you are trouble.

583
00:41:45,604 --> 00:41:47,003
Oh, the worst kind, darling.

584
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,172
In your last days
in the nursing home,

585
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,608
you'll think of me and giggle.

586
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,548
<i>Why, god,</i>

587
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,782
<i>why won't you answer my prayers?</i>

588
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:01,050
<i>You begged him for help,</i>

589
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,619
<i>and yet you look
around at your life</i>

590
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:04,153
<i>and nothing is different.</i>

591
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:07,056
<i>And so you assume
that god has told you no.</i>

592
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,294
<i>God doesn't say no.</i>

593
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:13,696
Why couldn't we
drive back to lubbock?

594
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,866
They ain't robbing
banks in lubbock.

595
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,568
We're not gonna
watch this, are we?

596
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:21,838
Ain't you Christian?

597
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,240
Yeah. But I ain't stupid.

598
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:25,875
God doesn't talk
through this man

599
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,844
any more than he
talks through my dog.

600
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:29,806
Well, then maybe you should
give your dog a listen.

601
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,781
Ain't you Indian?

602
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:35,018
You're supposed
to be burning Sage

603
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,787
and dancing around the bed
whooping like a bee stung you.

604
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:39,756
I'm catholic.

605
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,660
Come on.

606
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:49,666
Come on! I'd rather dance
around a fire with a spear.

607
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:52,635
I'd rather have you stab me
with a spear than watch this.

608
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:54,704
This son of a bitch,
he wouldn't know god

609
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:57,774
if he crawled up his pant leg
and bit him on the pecker.

610
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:58,942
Change the damn channel.

611
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:09,686
Now, this, this is
what god watches right here.

612
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:17,026
Don't worry, they're gonna have
soccer highlights on soon enough.

613
00:43:17,028 --> 00:43:18,928
That's for your Mexican half.

614
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,600
Ooh!

615
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,370
Wow, look at this boy run.

616
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:29,372
Longhorns are gonna have
a good team this year.

617
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:37,180
That soccer, never
could understand that.

618
00:43:37,182 --> 00:43:40,283
Anything a five-year-old
can do ain't a sport.

619
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:44,053
Who invented it? Aztecs?

620
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:46,222
Kickin' around skulls
or something, right?

621
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:49,859
Sounds like a comanche sport.

622
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,396
You know, in three weeks,

623
00:43:53,398 --> 00:43:56,833
you can watch whatever
you want on TV all day.

624
00:43:56,835 --> 00:43:59,402
Hell, you can do it
right now in your own room.

625
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:01,371
Oh, where's the fun in that?

626
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,374
You know what, Alberto?

627
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,643
What?

628
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,379
In a year's time,

629
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,282
it's my teasing
that you're gonna miss.

630
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,719
It's what you'll laugh about

631
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:18,521
when you stand over my grave
and wish me well.

632
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,391
God, I hope that's tomorrow.

633
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:23,793
Oh, that was a good one.

634
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,364
You'll get the hang of this yet.

635
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:36,939
Isn't it getting late for you?

636
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:42,912
Yeah.

637
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:48,851
Yeah, it is.

638
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:09,939
Oh, heavens above.
Heavens above.

639
00:45:09,941 --> 00:45:12,041
Look at those titties.
Are you fucking kidding me?

640
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:58,154
What are you doing?

641
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:04,460
Sleeping on the porch,
practicing my future.

642
00:46:10,502 --> 00:46:12,468
It's a dangerous thing
we do for a living.

643
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:15,171
You're lucky,

644
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,541
having seen it
through to the end.

645
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,310
I hope I'm that lucky.

646
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,014
Oh, well.

647
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:27,884
Without me by your side,

648
00:46:27,886 --> 00:46:29,318
I doubt you'd get close enough

649
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,521
to a criminal to ever be
in danger again.

650
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,700
Just when I was starting
to feel sorry for you.

651
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,900
Indians ain't supposed
to feel sorry for cowboys.

652
00:46:43,902 --> 00:46:45,168
It's the other way around.

653
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:55,545
And this makes you the executor?

654
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:57,580
Mmm-hmm.

655
00:46:57,582 --> 00:46:58,815
No matter what
they charge us with,

656
00:46:58,817 --> 00:47:00,583
they can't take it away.

657
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:03,252
There's no way to trace
funds from a casino.

658
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:04,987
All right? Once you get
the checks to the bank,

659
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,989
trust is untouchable.

660
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:10,560
You can't tell
nobody nothing, right?

661
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:12,228
Well, what is there to tell?

662
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,964
I mean, you boys won that
money gambling, didn't you?

663
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:21,137
$32,000 pays off
the reverse mortgage.

664
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:24,340
And those bastards paid the
property tax from 2012 to now,

665
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,609
that's another $11,000.

666
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:31,047
So, $43,000 and you
are free and clear.

667
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:34,617
Just have the loan officer
fax me a release of lien,

668
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:37,220
and I'll get that over to the
lease manager at chevron.

669
00:47:37,222 --> 00:47:38,154
The fax number is on the card.

670
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:39,589
Okay.

671
00:47:39,591 --> 00:47:41,123
How much you making
on this deal?

672
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,961
Not near as much as I'm risking.

673
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:45,963
Why you doin' it then?

674
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,403
You know, they loaned
the least they could.

675
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:57,506
Just enough to keep your mama
poor on a guaranteed return.

676
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:03,479
Thought they could swipe
her land for $25,000.

677
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:05,948
That's just so arrogant,
it makes my teeth hurt.

678
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:11,487
To see you boys

679
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:13,589
pay those bastards back
with their own money?

680
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:18,841
Well, if that ain't texan,
I don't know what is.

681
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:25,601
Thank you.

682
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:27,536
Now, they can
foreclose on Friday.

683
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:29,105
Come hell or high water,

684
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:30,606
be at the bank
in childress on Thursday.

685
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:32,008
Knowing them fuckers,
they will close early.

686
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:35,111
We'll be there. Oh, and, Toby,

687
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:37,313
the trust needs to be
managed by a bank.

688
00:48:37,315 --> 00:48:40,416
You really wanna
cover your tracks?

689
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,652
You get Texas midland
to handle this trust.

690
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,538
So,

691
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,374
what's the plan?

692
00:49:05,376 --> 00:49:08,644
We're gonna watch that bank
like a deer feeder.

693
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:11,180
In time, we'll be right.

694
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:15,184
Now, let's see what
they got to eat here.

695
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:17,320
Howdy, ma'am.
How are you doing today?

696
00:49:17,322 --> 00:49:19,722
Hot. And I don't
mean the good kind.

697
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,525
So, what don't you want?

698
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:24,694
Pardon?

699
00:49:24,696 --> 00:49:26,395
What don't you want?

700
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:31,667
Oh, well, uh,
I think I'll just, uh...

701
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:35,037
You know, I've been working
here for 44 years.

702
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:37,406
Ain't nobody
ever ordered nothing

703
00:49:37,408 --> 00:49:40,076
but t-bone steak
and a baked potato.

704
00:49:40,078 --> 00:49:42,745
Except this one asshole
from New York

705
00:49:42,747 --> 00:49:46,215
tried to order trout
back in 1987.

706
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:48,351
We don't sell
no goddamned trout.

707
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:52,288
T-bone steaks.

708
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:56,092
So, either you don't want
the corn on the cob,

709
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:58,494
or you don't want
the green beans.

710
00:49:58,496 --> 00:49:59,762
So, what don't you want?

711
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:05,735
I don't want green beans.

712
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:08,004
I don't want green beans either.

713
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:10,272
Steaks cooked medium rare.

714
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:12,641
Can I get my steak cooked...
That weren't no question.

715
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,543
All right.

716
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,680
Iced tea for you boys.

717
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:18,781
Iced tea would be great.

718
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,518
Iced tea, yep. Thank you, ma'am.

719
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,520
Uh-huh.

720
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:28,724
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

721
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,228
Nobody's gonna rob
this son of a bitch.

722
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:34,731
My word.

723
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:44,673
How's she feel?

724
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,810
She runs good.

725
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:49,078
Ain't gonna win any races.

726
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,480
Got new Mexico plates.

727
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:54,717
She got a top?

728
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:55,719
That's how she came.

729
00:50:57,754 --> 00:50:59,188
We'll take her.

730
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,592
Don't report it
stolen until Friday.

731
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,102
The guy from chevron is dropping
off the lease agreement.

732
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:15,204
Are you okay dealing
with that by yourself?

733
00:51:15,206 --> 00:51:16,686
You okay being with
Debbie by yourself?

734
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,309
Remember, he ain't the enemy.

735
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:21,871
Just take the papers,
and say thank you.

736
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:24,313
The oil man is the enemy,

737
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:26,182
make no mistake.
He just ain't ours.

738
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:29,718
I'll be back
to the ranch by dark.

739
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,654
I will be waiting.

740
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:33,896
Drive like a schoolteacher with
all this shit in the back.

741
00:51:37,327 --> 00:51:39,662
Sure feels like beer o'clock.

742
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,566
Ask and you shall receive.

743
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:14,363
Come in.

744
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:26,342
Mama died.

745
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:27,877
When?

746
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:29,745
A few weeks ago.

747
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,781
Well, good riddance.

748
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:35,251
No offense.

749
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:38,888
You okay?

750
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:41,624
You?

751
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:46,862
Here's the money I owe you.

752
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,867
I guess you'll be
selling the ranch.

753
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,537
It goes to the boys.

754
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:55,671
Really? Mmm.

755
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,540
It's been put in a trust.

756
00:52:57,542 --> 00:52:58,741
What's that mean?

757
00:52:58,743 --> 00:52:59,863
It means no one can sell it.

758
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:05,281
Great. Something else
I got to take care of.

759
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,395
Hi.

760
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:57,933
Where's your brother?

761
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:01,303
I don't know.

762
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:03,472
Friend's house, I guess.

763
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:11,673
How come you ain't in school?

764
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,750
School don't start yet.

765
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:17,019
Just two-a-days
for football right now.

766
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,994
Your grandmother died.

767
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:29,698
I'm giving the ranch
to you and your brother.

768
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,695
Remember going out there
when you was little?

769
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,539
What am I supposed
to do with a ranch?

770
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:40,009
Anything but sell it.

771
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:44,046
We found oil on it.

772
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:49,984
You and your brother ain't gonna
have to worry about money no more.

773
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,455
Now,

774
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:57,760
you may be hearing
a lot of things about me

775
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:00,029
and your uncle.

776
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,700
Don't be like us.

777
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:05,702
You hear me?

778
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,738
Whatever I hear,
I won't believe.

779
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,839
No, you believe it.

780
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:13,709
I did all of it.

781
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:17,946
Now, you, you do it different.

782
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:29,958
Ain't gonna drink it?

783
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,830
You tell me not to be like you,

784
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:35,992
and then you offer me a beer.

785
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,800
Which is it?

786
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:41,937
Good boy.

787
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,560
How are the boys?
What are you doin'?

788
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,629
Insurance.

789
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:09,598
I don't want that
shit in the car.

790
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,767
We'll be running two
cars next time, brother.

791
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:13,602
They'll ride with me.

792
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,977
So, this is your plan?

793
00:56:21,979 --> 00:56:23,679
We're just gonna sit here

794
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:26,048
and see if this is
the branch they rob next.

795
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,516
What would you rather do?

796
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:29,151
You wanna drive 80 miles
back to olney

797
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:32,054
and look for more fingerprints
that we ain't gonna find?

798
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:34,857
Or you wanna drive 200 miles
back to lubbock

799
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:36,725
and look at mug shots
that don't matter

800
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,827
because nobody knows what these
sons of bitches look like.

801
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:41,830
Or we can just wait here
for them to rob this bank,

802
00:56:41,832 --> 00:56:44,600
which is the one thing I'm pretty
damn sure they are going to do.

803
00:56:44,602 --> 00:56:47,569
I know what you're doing.

804
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,639
You're trying to make this last as long
as you can because the longer it lasts,

805
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:52,508
the farther you are
from that front porch.

806
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:55,110
No, I'm waitin' for these
boys to make a mistake.

807
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:56,779
So far they ain't,
but they will.

808
00:56:56,781 --> 00:56:58,021
And they're gonna make it here.

809
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:00,849
So, just relax.

810
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,952
Enjoy this little town.

811
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:06,054
Do you wanna live here?

812
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:09,725
Got an old hardware store that
charges twice what home depot does,

813
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:13,829
one restaurant with a
rattlesnake for a waitress.

814
00:57:13,831 --> 00:57:16,832
I mean, how is anybody supposed
to make a living here?

815
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:19,468
People have made a living
here for 150 years.

816
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:22,137
Well, people lived
in caves for 150,000 years.

817
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:23,705
But they don't do it no more.

818
00:57:23,707 --> 00:57:25,507
Well, maybe your people did.

819
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:29,912
Your people did, too.

820
00:57:29,914 --> 00:57:32,514
A long time ago, your
ancestors was the Indians,

821
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,718
till someone came
along and killed them,

822
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,688
broke 'em down,
made you into one of them.

823
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:46,028
150 years ago, all of this
was my ancestors' land.

824
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,231
Everything you could see.

825
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,134
Everything you saw yesterday.

826
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:56,071
Till the grandparents
of these folks took it.

827
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,242
And now, it's been
taken from them.

828
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,579
Except it ain't
no army doing it.

829
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:07,049
It's those sons of bitches
right there.

830
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:18,594
You thinking about tomorrow?

831
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,097
Ain't you?

832
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,967
That little hotel clerk.

833
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,837
Why is it always the sweet ones

834
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,173
that are such devils
when you get them revved up?

835
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:35,143
Wouldn't know,
never had a sweet one.

836
00:58:36,547 --> 00:58:38,547
Yeah, you like them pissed off,

837
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:39,915
lookin' for someone to blame.

838
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,218
Sure seems that way.

839
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,105
It's a good thing you're doing.

840
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:01,236
We're doing it.

841
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,687
Go easy on
the bank teller tomorrow.

842
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,291
I'll be as gentle
as a young nurse.

843
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:28,023
You coming?

844
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:30,359
On my way.

845
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:15,737
Hey.

846
01:01:16,873 --> 01:01:17,873
Shit.

847
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:23,111
Good morning.

848
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:26,915
You want some breakfast?

849
01:01:26,917 --> 01:01:28,950
Yeah, breakfast sounds good.

850
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:36,792
So we hit the jayton branch
first, then Coleman, right?

851
01:01:36,794 --> 01:01:38,274
Yeah, that should
get us what we need.

852
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:34,916
Let's do this.

853
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:42,157
Ugh... shit.

854
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:43,492
That's not part
of the fucking plan.

855
01:02:43,494 --> 01:02:44,893
Bastards closed down the branch.

856
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,396
What now, little brother?

857
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,767
Coleman.

858
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:27,803
What the hell you doing?

859
01:03:27,805 --> 01:03:28,904
We gotta head to post.

860
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:30,238
What the hell you doing? Get...

861
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,281
We got to head to post.
What are you talking about?

862
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:40,448
We got to head to post.

863
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,884
We're going to Coleman.

864
01:03:42,886 --> 01:03:44,186
There's only one
teller in Coleman.

865
01:03:44,188 --> 01:03:45,468
Whatever we get won't be enough.

866
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,557
We go to Coleman right now.

867
01:03:48,559 --> 02:07:37,116
If that ain't enough,
we head to post.

868
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,992
If we don't leave now for post,

869
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:52,327
we won't get there till noon.

870
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:55,263
You don't wanna rob a bank
at lunchtime, do you?

871
01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:56,832
Yeah, we don't know the
patterns of folks out there.

872
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:58,533
The patterns are
the same everywhere.

873
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:00,602
All these towns are dead.
Post ain't no different.

874
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,004
It's a bigger bank.

875
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:06,141
We'll leave your
car just out of town.

876
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,275
Come on now.

877
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:09,411
Shit.

878
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:20,422
I think I got this figured.

879
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:25,894
First two banks,
they were Texas midland banks.

880
01:04:25,896 --> 01:04:27,929
All right, there are seven
branches altogether.

881
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:30,332
The main branch
is in fort worth.

882
01:04:30,334 --> 01:04:33,301
They're not gonna
mess with that.

883
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:36,905
All right? They hit
the branch in olney.

884
01:04:36,907 --> 01:04:38,440
They hit the one in Archer city.

885
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:40,942
Then there's the one here.

886
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:42,244
Which they did not hit.

887
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:47,916
Alberto, will you
please follow me?

888
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:51,586
Just keep your mouth shut

889
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:53,555
and just listen
to what I'm gonna say.

890
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:56,391
There's the one here,

891
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:58,226
then there's the one
in childress.

892
01:04:58,228 --> 01:04:59,995
There's the one in jayton.

893
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:01,496
That one's closed.

894
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:03,098
I know that one's closed!

895
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:08,470
I know that one's
closed, Alberto.

896
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:14,910
That's my point.
Jayton is closed.

897
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,379
That just leaves post.

898
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:19,147
They're not gonna mess
with the bank in childress,

899
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:20,615
that's a fairly
decent-sized town.

900
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:25,387
The branch in Vernon wasn't
Midlands and they hit that.

901
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:28,123
Yeah, one of them did. Alone.

902
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:31,159
Then he ran all the way across
the road to get to the car.

903
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:33,395
I think his partner had no
idea that was gonna happen.

904
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:35,397
And what does that mean to us?

905
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:38,400
It means that the only branch
that fits the bill is in post.

906
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:39,402
Well, then let's go.

907
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,030
The town looks busy.

908
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:11,967
Little bit.

909
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,609
My word.

910
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:33,989
It's too big.

911
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:35,156
That's what she said.

912
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:40,662
It's no good.

913
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:42,330
Aw, this ain't your first rodeo.

914
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,134
Bigger bank.

915
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:49,371
More money.

916
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,359
Everybody,
get on the fucking ground!

917
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,328
Get on the fucking ground!

918
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:16,531
Young ladies, get on
the fucking ground! Now!

919
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:20,802
Sir, down! On the ground! Now!

920
01:07:20,804 --> 01:07:22,404
Thank you very much.

921
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:27,409
Tellers stand up!

922
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:30,812
Open the drawers!

923
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,051
Get down!

924
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,254
Take three steps back!

925
01:07:39,256 --> 01:07:41,623
Open the fucking drawer,
young lady!

926
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:43,425
Are you deaf and dumb?

927
01:07:43,427 --> 01:07:45,560
I said open
the motherfucking drawer!

928
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:46,795
You, down!

929
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:49,264
Now, step back!

930
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,568
Very good.
Someone's paying attention.

931
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:58,740
Now, get on your
motherfucking knees!

932
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:00,642
Hey!

933
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,211
Stay down!

934
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,720
All right.

935
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:48,523
Hey, hey, let's go!

936
01:08:48,525 --> 01:08:50,358
Call 911.

937
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:52,861
Jesus fucking Christ.

938
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:56,364
The whole goddamn
town is shooting at us.

939
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,767
Get in the back.
Get in the fucking back.

940
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:15,316
Come on, let's go,
get in the car!

941
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:16,318
Don't let them get away!

942
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,890
How you doing
back there, little brother?

943
01:09:21,892 --> 01:09:24,259
You fucking killed them.

944
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:27,495
Those concealed carry permits sure
complicate a bank robbery, don't they?

945
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:28,796
It's not my fault it was payday.

946
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,603
This has gone too far, tan.

947
01:09:35,605 --> 01:09:37,639
No one was supposed
to fucking die.

948
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:40,208
It was them
or us, take your pick.

949
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:56,624
Yeah, go, Margaret.

950
01:09:56,626 --> 01:09:58,793
Texas Midlands in post
has just been hit.

951
01:09:58,795 --> 01:10:01,462
Ah! What did I tell you?

952
01:10:01,464 --> 01:10:02,664
Yeah.

953
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:04,799
Yeah. Locals are in chase.

954
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:08,403
Suspects escaping
west in an old bronco.

955
01:10:08,405 --> 01:10:09,637
All right, Margaret,
keep us posted.

956
01:10:09,639 --> 01:10:11,206
We're on our way there.

957
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,208
Give me an Indian whoop.
Come on.

958
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:17,412
These boys gonna go down.

959
01:10:17,414 --> 01:10:19,747
Let's get some giddy-up
music going on there.

960
01:10:24,487 --> 01:10:25,747
Oh, please, not that.

961
01:10:44,808 --> 01:10:45,940
Yeah.

962
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:51,746
Hey, hey. Come on.
Snap out of it.

963
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:56,251
Snap the fuck out of it.

964
01:10:57,453 --> 01:10:59,787
Shit, let me see that.
You're hit.

965
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:00,949
Boy, you're hit. Get the back.

966
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:06,527
Well, you'll live.
It's a through and through.

967
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:08,696
Compress it. Wrap it up.

968
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:10,365
You got to wrap it up tight.

969
01:11:10,367 --> 01:11:11,607
Front and back, front and back.

970
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:15,403
Wrap it tight.

971
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:25,046
Oh, brother, hear me now,
hear me clear.

972
01:11:25,048 --> 01:11:27,782
Unless you wanna be a black
mark on your sons' lives,

973
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:29,951
I need you mountain lion mean.

974
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:31,719
You hear me?

975
01:11:31,721 --> 01:11:32,954
I hear you.

976
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:34,555
Mountain lion mean. Yeah.

977
01:11:34,557 --> 01:11:37,525
Yeah. It's gonna be okay,
it's gonna be okay.

978
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:39,627
Hold on. Yeah.

979
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:37,652
Go.

980
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:49,997
Here, take the money.

981
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:56,671
Let's go. Get to the casino,

982
01:12:56,673 --> 01:12:57,839
change the money
like we planned.

983
01:12:57,841 --> 01:13:00,074
This was your plan.
And it worked.

984
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:02,443
Every step of the way.

985
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:04,746
Trust it.

986
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:11,552
Where are you headed?

987
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:18,860
Don't be stupid.

988
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:23,598
I love you, Toby.

989
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:28,669
I mean it.

990
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:36,944
I love you, too.

991
01:13:43,185 --> 01:13:45,620
Hey, tobe, go fuck yourself.

992
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:46,821
Go fuck yourself.

993
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:26,093
Yippee hiyiyo.
You little doggies.

994
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:00,995
This is what they call
white man's intuition.

995
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:04,665
Sometimes a blind pig
finds a truffle.

996
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:02,823
Back up! Oh, shit!

997
01:16:02,825 --> 01:16:04,091
Go! Move!

998
01:16:15,337 --> 01:16:16,938
My word.

999
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:19,273
All right. We're gonna
need a SWAT unit up here

1000
01:16:19,275 --> 01:16:20,241
and a helo to pin
these boys down.

1001
01:16:20,243 --> 01:16:21,243
I'm on it.

1002
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,921
<i>Suspect is a white male.</i>

1003
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:39,827
He's got a rifle. Get down.

1004
01:16:39,829 --> 01:16:41,269
He's on the Ridge!
He's on the Ridge!

1005
01:16:44,199 --> 01:16:45,199
Come on! I see him!

1006
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,036
There's just one?

1007
01:16:49,038 --> 01:16:50,605
Yep, just one.

1008
01:16:50,607 --> 01:16:51,973
There's supposed
to be two of them.

1009
01:16:51,975 --> 01:16:55,676
Maybe the town folks got one.

1010
01:16:55,678 --> 01:16:57,712
Well, if they did,
they got the smart one.

1011
01:16:57,714 --> 01:17:00,014
This old boy is out of his mind.

1012
01:17:00,016 --> 01:17:01,949
Why don't you slip up
this canyon and tomahawk

1013
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:02,951
that son of a bitch?

1014
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,872
Ranger down. Call it in.

1015
01:17:24,874 --> 01:17:28,275
Get back. Back.
Back those trucks up.

1016
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:31,178
Get back.

1017
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,048
Get these trucks back.

1018
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:35,816
Back up.

1019
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:39,687
Back them up.

1020
01:17:39,689 --> 01:17:41,188
How well you know
the land around here?

1021
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:43,190
Like the back of my hand.

1022
01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:45,860
All right. He's hid up in
that brush on that hill.

1023
01:17:45,862 --> 01:17:47,695
Can you get me up
there behind him?

1024
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:49,363
Give me a half hour,
I'll have that bastard

1025
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:51,832
field dressed on
the hood of my truck.

1026
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:53,668
I can't let you do
that. You just get me there.

1027
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:55,836
That's gonna be a 500-yard
shot if he's where you said.

1028
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:56,838
Just get me there!

1029
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:12,687
Shit.

1030
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:58,499
How are you doing?

1031
01:18:58,501 --> 01:18:59,501
Good. You?

1032
01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:02,002
Where are you headed?

1033
01:19:02,004 --> 01:19:03,137
Ruidoso.

1034
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,474
Where you from?

1035
01:19:06,476 --> 01:19:07,476
Hamlin.

1036
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:11,445
Taking the scenic route?

1037
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:15,382
Taking the only way I can.

1038
01:19:15,384 --> 01:19:17,218
They got the road
closed at post.

1039
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:18,980
Everywhere you turn
they got the road closed.

1040
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:22,223
You got your license on you?
Yes, I do.

1041
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:28,329
Wait right there.

1042
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:29,463
Yes, sir.

1043
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:08,803
Sir. Yeah.

1044
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:11,539
Have a good day.

1045
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,541
Thanks much.

1046
01:21:16,404 --> 01:21:18,305
You're pretty winded.

1047
01:21:18,307 --> 01:21:20,975
Y'oughta let me take the shot.
Hell, it's my gun.

1048
01:21:20,977 --> 01:21:24,445
Not on your life. He's mine.

1049
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:55,676
Just left of the tree.

1050
01:21:55,678 --> 01:21:56,911
I got him.

1051
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:14,929
I got you.

1052
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:24,705
Lord of the plains.

1053
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:29,243
That's me.

1054
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:44,618
<i>Then like something
out of a dime-store novel,</i>

1055
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:48,055
<i>Texas highway
patrol and the locals</i>

1056
01:23:48,057 --> 01:23:50,758
<i>chased the robbers
to this hillside behind me,</i>

1057
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,660
<i>20 miles west of town,</i>

1058
01:23:53,662 --> 01:23:57,197
<i>where the gunfight continued.
And right now we do know</i>

1059
01:23:57,199 --> 01:24:01,435
<i>ranger Marcus Hamilton
killed one of the gunmen</i>

1060
01:24:01,437 --> 01:24:04,605
<i>using a rifle he actually
borrowed from a resident here.</i>

1061
01:24:04,607 --> 01:24:07,808
<i>We don't know the name
of that suspect yet...</i>

1062
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:06,400
Lucky guy.

1063
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:11,405
Just in the Nick of time, too.

1064
01:25:11,407 --> 01:25:12,439
What are the odds?

1065
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:19,847
Now, this, uh, satisfies

1066
01:25:19,849 --> 01:25:23,283
both the reverse mortgage
loan and the, uh...

1067
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:25,886
And the back taxes that we've
paid on your mother's behalf.

1068
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,855
We do that as courtesy,
of course.

1069
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,828
You can fax the release
of lien to that number.

1070
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:39,867
An attorney?

1071
01:25:41,765 --> 01:25:43,204
All right. Well, I'll...

1072
01:25:43,205 --> 01:25:46,840
I'll get that faxed over to your
attorney by the end of the week.

1073
01:25:46,842 --> 01:25:48,842
It is the end of the week.
I wanna watch you do it.

1074
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:57,684
Well, it takes
a little time to prepare.

1075
01:25:57,686 --> 01:25:58,886
I got all day.

1076
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:13,634
Okay. That's it.

1077
01:26:13,636 --> 01:26:16,904
And it's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

1078
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,253
Let me ask you a question.

1079
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:36,456
Do y'all manage trusts?

1080
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:43,931
Hey, Marcus, ain't you
supposed to be retired?

1081
01:26:43,933 --> 01:26:44,933
Howdy.

1082
01:26:50,772 --> 01:26:52,773
Nice to see you.

1083
01:26:52,775 --> 01:26:53,774
Well, hey, Marcus.

1084
01:26:53,776 --> 01:26:55,409
Hey, Margaret.

1085
01:26:55,411 --> 01:26:56,510
Been awhile.
How's life as a civilian?

1086
01:26:56,512 --> 01:27:00,347
Oh, just, you know...

1087
01:27:00,349 --> 01:27:02,683
Think I can take a peek
at Mr. Howard's file?

1088
01:27:03,318 --> 01:27:04,351
Tanner Howard.

1089
01:27:06,321 --> 01:27:08,922
Oh, come on. I ain't got
nothing better to do.

1090
01:27:08,924 --> 01:27:10,691
It's at my desk.

1091
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:12,392
Uh...

1092
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:14,761
Oh.

1093
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:20,467
He killed this father
in a hunting accident, huh?

1094
01:27:20,469 --> 01:27:23,537
I'd love to know what he was
hunting in the barn in April.

1095
01:27:23,539 --> 01:27:26,974
Ten years in huntsville
for aggravated assault.

1096
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,709
Cellmate was released in 2012.

1097
01:27:28,711 --> 01:27:30,544
Before that,
he served seven years

1098
01:27:30,546 --> 01:27:32,512
on bank robbery
charges up in big spring.

1099
01:27:32,514 --> 01:27:34,948
Been trying to track him
down, but no luck so far.

1100
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,817
You all are off the brother?

1101
01:27:36,819 --> 01:27:39,886
There's nothing that links
him to the robberies.

1102
01:27:39,888 --> 01:27:42,489
And what about that
little waitress in Vernon?

1103
01:27:42,491 --> 01:27:45,592
Yeah, we showed her photos, and she
said she didn't recognize him.

1104
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,274
Pretty upset you took
her tips as evidence.

1105
01:27:49,298 --> 01:27:51,031
She sure was sassy.

1106
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:52,966
You show that to that old timer?

1107
01:27:52,968 --> 01:27:55,836
Yup. He said he didn't look
like the fella from the diner.

1108
01:27:55,838 --> 01:27:58,305
He didn't recognize
Tanner's photo either.

1109
01:27:58,307 --> 01:27:59,906
Yeah. Tried to get a court order

1110
01:27:59,908 --> 01:28:01,608
on his bank accounts
and the ranch,

1111
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:03,477
da wouldn't do it.
Toby's got no record.

1112
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:05,512
He's never been arrested.

1113
01:28:05,514 --> 01:28:07,547
His only court appearance
was at his divorce.

1114
01:28:07,549 --> 01:28:09,750
He don't fit the bill, Marcus.

1115
01:28:09,752 --> 01:28:11,551
People don't start out
robbing banks.

1116
01:28:11,553 --> 01:28:13,820
They graduate to it
like his asshole brother.

1117
01:28:13,822 --> 01:28:15,589
Besides, when we was out there,

1118
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:17,391
we saw two crews from chevron

1119
01:28:17,393 --> 01:28:19,593
capping Wells and
putting in pumpjacks.

1120
01:28:19,595 --> 01:28:21,495
Engineers out there
said they're gonna pull

1121
01:28:21,497 --> 01:28:23,664
2,000 barrels a month
off that place.

1122
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:25,399
You just try convincing a judge

1123
01:28:25,401 --> 01:28:27,034
to issue warrants on somebody

1124
01:28:27,036 --> 01:28:29,836
set to clear $50,000 a month for
robbing $40,000 from the bank

1125
01:28:29,838 --> 01:28:31,738
that manages the family trust.

1126
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:33,407
Midland manages the trust?

1127
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:39,413
You'd think they'd want
this thing figured out.

1128
01:28:39,415 --> 01:28:41,481
I don't think the bank
cares about anything

1129
01:28:41,483 --> 01:28:44,017
but keeping that trust
right where it is.

1130
01:28:44,019 --> 01:28:46,099
Hell, they were less cooperative
than Toby's attorney.

1131
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:51,792
Marcus, he's not a suspect
and you are retired.

1132
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:53,994
Oh, I hear you.

1133
01:28:58,366 --> 01:28:59,599
You like the desk?

1134
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:02,069
I don't hate it.

1135
01:29:04,906 --> 01:29:06,073
Hey, I'll see you, Marcus.

1136
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:44,571
Know who I am?

1137
01:30:49,043 --> 01:30:50,744
I'm the man
who killed your brother.

1138
01:30:51,512 --> 01:30:52,512
I know.

1139
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:56,616
I also know you're retired
and you're trespassing.

1140
01:30:58,219 --> 01:30:59,586
Oh, you could shoot me now

1141
01:30:59,588 --> 01:31:01,922
and be within your rights.

1142
01:31:01,924 --> 01:31:04,691
You toting a gun and all,
how convenient.

1143
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:07,561
I figure you got one, too.

1144
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:14,901
Mind if I sit?

1145
01:31:19,674 --> 01:31:20,674
Go ahead.

1146
01:31:44,065 --> 01:31:45,232
You want a beer?

1147
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:49,569
Sure. I ain't on duty no more.

1148
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:01,181
Thanks.

1149
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:09,122
It's nice out here
in this breeze, though,

1150
01:32:09,124 --> 01:32:10,824
now that it's cooled down.

1151
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:22,669
How did you do it?

1152
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,608
Oh, never mind. I'll
figure that out in time.

1153
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:32,779
Why? Why did you do it?

1154
01:32:32,781 --> 01:32:35,181
I know why your brother,
Tanner, did it.

1155
01:32:35,183 --> 01:32:37,951
He robbed them banks
because he liked it.

1156
01:32:40,254 --> 01:32:42,956
He shot my partner
300 yards away

1157
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:44,891
because he liked it,
it made him feel good.

1158
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:49,996
If I hadn't blown
his shit for brains out,

1159
01:32:49,998 --> 01:32:53,700
there'd be a new truck
out front with jet skis,

1160
01:32:53,702 --> 01:32:55,702
and whatever else
he could think to buy.

1161
01:32:55,704 --> 01:32:57,003
He'd spend it all
just to give him

1162
01:32:57,005 --> 01:32:58,972
an excuse to steal some more.

1163
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:01,207
But not you.

1164
01:33:03,945 --> 01:33:05,812
There's nothing new around here,

1165
01:33:06,981 --> 01:33:10,216
except them pumpjacks.

1166
01:33:10,218 --> 01:33:11,952
Each one of them
making you a month

1167
01:33:11,954 --> 01:33:13,286
what you and your brother stole

1168
01:33:13,288 --> 01:33:15,088
from all four banks combined.

1169
01:33:16,691 --> 01:33:18,158
Help me understand, then.

1170
01:33:21,062 --> 01:33:25,332
Help me understand
why four people died

1171
01:33:25,334 --> 01:33:29,169
so you could steal money that
it don't seem you've spent,

1172
01:33:29,171 --> 01:33:30,370
that it don't seem you need.

1173
01:33:31,172 --> 01:33:32,872
You got a family?

1174
01:33:32,874 --> 01:33:35,875
My partner had a family.
A big one.

1175
01:33:35,877 --> 01:33:38,044
They don't got no pumpjacks
in their backyard.

1176
01:33:38,046 --> 01:33:39,045
I didn't kill your friend.

1177
01:33:39,047 --> 01:33:40,246
Yes, you did.

1178
01:33:41,882 --> 01:33:45,352
By setting this thing in motion.

1179
01:33:45,354 --> 01:33:48,188
You expect me to believe your
dimwitted brother planned this?

1180
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:53,960
Oh, no. This was
smart, this was you.

1181
01:33:57,832 --> 01:33:59,265
I've been poor my whole life.

1182
01:34:03,337 --> 01:34:05,372
So were my parents,
their parents before them.

1183
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:09,309
It's like a disease

1184
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:13,713
passing from generation
to generation,

1185
01:34:13,715 --> 01:34:15,195
becomes a sickness,
that's what it is.

1186
01:34:17,351 --> 01:34:18,885
Infects every person you know,

1187
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:21,354
but not my boys.

1188
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:24,190
Not anymore.

1189
01:34:28,229 --> 01:34:29,396
This is theirs now.

1190
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:36,236
Now, I ain't never killed
no one in my life,

1191
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:37,404
but if you want me
to start with you,

1192
01:34:37,406 --> 01:34:39,105
let's get on with it, old man.

1193
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:42,308
See if you can grab that pistol

1194
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:43,910
before I blast you
off this porch.

1195
01:35:23,417 --> 01:35:25,218
Howdy. What's going on?

1196
01:35:27,021 --> 01:35:29,856
The hogs are back in the garden.

1197
01:35:29,858 --> 01:35:31,991
Feral hogs tearing up this
place something fierce.

1198
01:35:33,861 --> 01:35:35,061
Who's this?

1199
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:36,463
I'm an old friend
of your husband.

1200
01:35:37,865 --> 01:35:38,965
Ex-husband.

1201
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:42,235
I'm just working on the house.

1202
01:35:43,304 --> 01:35:45,438
Oh, you don't live here?

1203
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,108
No, it's not mine. It's theirs.

1204
01:35:51,011 --> 01:35:52,512
Oh.

1205
01:35:52,514 --> 01:35:54,814
The things we do
for our kids, huh?

1206
01:35:57,318 --> 01:35:58,418
Well...

1207
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:02,021
I best be going.

1208
01:36:02,023 --> 01:36:03,356
Ma'am.

1209
01:36:03,358 --> 01:36:05,158
Me too, Debbie.
I'm gonna wash up,

1210
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:08,128
be back around 9:00 tomorrow
to finish the front.

1211
01:36:08,130 --> 01:36:09,229
Start painting the extension,

1212
01:36:09,231 --> 01:36:10,864
and then help Randy
with his homework

1213
01:36:10,866 --> 01:36:12,766
when he gets back
from school, okay?

1214
01:36:13,434 --> 01:36:14,534
Okay.

1215
01:36:17,972 --> 01:36:19,072
Hey.

1216
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:22,242
I'm renting
a little house in town.

1217
01:36:24,245 --> 01:36:26,179
If you wanna stop by
and finish this conversation,

1218
01:36:26,181 --> 01:36:27,247
you're welcome anytime.

1219
01:36:28,849 --> 01:36:30,216
Oh, I'd like that.

1220
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:32,819
I'll be seeing you.

1221
01:36:32,821 --> 01:36:35,421
Yeah. Soon, I hope.

1222
01:36:38,058 --> 01:36:39,893
I'm ready to be done with this.

1223
01:36:39,895 --> 01:36:42,195
You'll never be done
with it no matter what.

1224
01:36:42,197 --> 01:36:45,565
It's gonna haunt you, son,
for the rest of your days.

1225
01:36:45,567 --> 01:36:49,369
But you won't be alone.
It's gonna haunt me, too.

1226
01:36:49,371 --> 01:36:51,437
If you stop by,
maybe I'll give you peace.

1227
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:55,208
Maybe. Maybe I'll
give it to you.
