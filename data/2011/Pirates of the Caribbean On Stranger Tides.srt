1
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:39,220
Who are you?

2
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:33,828
What is this?

3
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:37,154
Your Majesty, we caught him up
in a fishing net. A fishing net.

4
00:02:37,254 --> 00:02:39,168
Sire, he's been telling stories.
Stories that...

5
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,058
We believe he's found a...

6
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:51,129
Ponce de Leon.

7
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:55,889
Says he found
Ponce de Leon's ship.

8
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,670
- Or sailed on it.
- No, I told you,

9
00:02:58,841 --> 00:03:00,945
Ponce de Leon died
200 years ago.

10
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:04,279
Aye, but he died searching
for something, didn't he?

11
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:09,356
The Fountain of Youth.

12
00:03:14,343 --> 00:03:16,211
How soon can you sail?

13
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,824
With the tide.

14
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:41,807
Pirate swords! Pirate swords!

15
00:03:41,978 --> 00:03:45,345
Pirate's execution today.
Watch him swing!

16
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:47,301
Pirate puppets!

17
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:50,980
Hurry, papa,
or we'll miss the hanging!

18
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:54,817
It's not a hanging, dear, it's a trial.
The hanging comes this afternoon.

19
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:57,003
Pirate hanging today!

20
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,094
Come on. Up you get.

21
00:04:02,582 --> 00:04:04,804
Move along, pirate.

22
00:04:05,368 --> 00:04:07,872
Or should I say "Captain Pirate"?

23
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,251
Come on.
Come on! Up you go.

24
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:14,255
Quiet! Order!

25
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,189
Quiet!

26
00:04:18,314 --> 00:04:20,150
Now appearing before the court,

27
00:04:20,444 --> 00:04:23,098
the notorious and infamous
pirate, pillager,

28
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:24,634
- and highwayman...
- Quiet!

29
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:27,094
captain Jack Sparrow!

30
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:34,226
I told you, the name's Gibbs!
Joshamee Gibbs!

31
00:04:34,405 --> 00:04:36,343
- How many times...
- Hear ye, hear ye!

32
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,650
Presiding over these trials,

33
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:43,803
all rise and attend,
the Right Honorable Justice Smith!

34
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,955
My dear sir.

35
00:04:58,916 --> 00:04:59,958
Quiet!

36
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:03,248
Now...

37
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:06,891
what do we have here?

38
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:08,372
Jack?

39
00:05:08,522 --> 00:05:09,636
Shut up!

40
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:11,854
I don't recognize him.

41
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:15,105
Not necessary. You were saying?

42
00:05:16,177 --> 00:05:20,176
Jack Sparrow is not my name.
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.

43
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:21,709
Is that so?

44
00:05:21,994 --> 00:05:24,985
- It says Jack Sparrow here.
- I told 'em.

45
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:28,478
I'm not Jack Sparrow, who I would
be happy to identify to the court

46
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,483
- if it would help my case.
- I think that would be a poor defense,

47
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,449
unless you want to be bludgeoned again
like a harp seal.

48
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:40,190
The prisoner claims of being innocent
to being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?

49
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,531
No trial? But aren't we here
to examine the evidence...

50
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:45,547
Foreman, your finding. Guilty?

51
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:47,556
Guilty verdict means he'll hang.

52
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:51,779
Hang 'im! String 'im up!

53
00:05:54,192 --> 00:05:56,658
- Guilty?
- That's not fair!

54
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:57,979
Shut it.

55
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:02,609
Joshamee Gibbs, the crime of which
you've been found guilty of

56
00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:05,526
is being innocent
of being Jack Sparrow.

57
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:08,464
I hereby commute your sentence,

58
00:06:08,946 --> 00:06:10,923
and order that you be imprisoned
for the remainder

59
00:06:11,023 --> 00:06:13,833
of your miserable, moribund,
mutton-chopped life.

60
00:06:14,003 --> 00:06:16,191
- What?!
- Hang 'im!

61
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
- Hang 'im!
- There.

62
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:21,280
- Balderdash!
- String 'im up! Hang 'im high!

63
00:06:22,774 --> 00:06:25,044
Means shall be arranged
to transport this prisoner

64
00:06:25,223 --> 00:06:27,214
to the Tower of London.

65
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:40,017
Thanks very much.

66
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:46,053
Ta.

67
00:06:49,454 --> 00:06:51,930
Come on. Get up there.

68
00:06:54,844 --> 00:06:55,971
Get up!

69
00:07:00,882 --> 00:07:04,500
Hell's teeth.
Now, we're both headed for prison.

70
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,340
Not to worry.
I've paid off the driver.

71
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:10,847
Ten minutes, we'll be outside
London Town, horses waiting.

72
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:12,507
Tonight, we make the coast.

73
00:07:12,686 --> 00:07:14,988
Then, it's just a matter
of finding a ship.

74
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:18,930
- All part of the plan, yes?
- Exactly.

75
00:07:19,454 --> 00:07:21,114
I arrived in London Town
just this morning

76
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:24,311
to rescue one Joshamee Gibbs
from one appointment with the gallows.

77
00:07:24,683 --> 00:07:26,229
Seeing as how you're still alive,

78
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:29,115
I'd say it's all been
very successful thus far.

79
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:30,988
What happened to you, Gibbs?

80
00:07:31,163 --> 00:07:33,700
I thought you were employed elsewhere
or otherwise engaged.

81
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:37,800
Aye. But I always listened like a thief
for news of the Black Pearl...

82
00:07:38,268 --> 00:07:40,355
Nobody's seen where
she might next make port.

83
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:42,237
Then, I hear a rumor:

84
00:07:42,725 --> 00:07:45,757
Jack Sparrow's in London
with a ship and lookin' for a crew.

85
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:47,857
- Am not.
- But that's what I heard.

86
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:50,342
Fact is,
you're signin' up men tonight.

87
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:52,178
Pub called
"The Captain's Daughter".

88
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:55,057
- Am not!
- Well, I thought it a bit odd,

89
00:07:55,227 --> 00:07:58,866
but, then, you've never been
the most predictable of sorts.

90
00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:01,015
Tell me something.

91
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:04,725
There is another Jack Sparrow
out there, sullying my good name?

92
00:08:04,904 --> 00:08:07,449
- An impostor.
- Indeed.

93
00:08:07,549 --> 00:08:12,960
- But... an impostor with a ship.
- And in need of a crew.

94
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:16,135
Which, as fate would have it,
so am I.

95
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,470
What about you, Jack?

96
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:22,781
Last I heard, you were hell-bent
to find the Fountain of Youth.

97
00:08:23,346 --> 00:08:24,472
Any luck?

98
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:29,217
Circumstances arose
and forced a compelling insight

99
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:31,559
regarding discretion and valour.

100
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:34,245
- Meaning... you gave up.
- I did not.

101
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:37,616
I'm just as bent as ever.
Hellishly so.

102
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:42,574
I shall taste those waters,
master Gibbs. Mark my words.

103
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:46,659
Oh! Short trip.

104
00:08:55,806 --> 00:08:57,963
All part of the plan, yes?

105
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:02,779
No.

106
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:33,990
You are... Jack Sparrow...

107
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:36,920
There should be a "captain"
in there somewhere.

108
00:10:37,148 --> 00:10:41,786
I have heard of you.
And you know who I am.

109
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:45,186
Face is familiar.
Have I... threatened you before?

110
00:10:45,286 --> 00:10:48,971
You are in the presence of
George Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Nunburg,

111
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,982
Archtreasurer and Prince-elector
of the Holy Roman Empire,

112
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,787
King of Great Britain and Ireland,
and of you.

113
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,364
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- I am informed

114
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:04,382
you have come to London
to procure a crew for your ship.

115
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,246
Vicious rumor. Not true.

116
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,499
Then you lied to me when you
told me you were Jack Sparrow.

117
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,878
I am Jack Sparrow,
but I'm not here to procure a crew.

118
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,760
That is... someone else.

119
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:20,776
Ah... Someone else
named Jack Sparrow.

120
00:11:21,157 --> 00:11:23,050
You've brought me
the wrong wastrel.

121
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:26,467
Find the proper one
and dispose of this impostor.

122
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,580
No, wait, wait, wait.
Hang on a minute.

123
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,221
I'm Jack Sparrow,
the one and only.

124
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,061
And I am in London.

125
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:35,271
To procure a crew.

126
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,106
To undertake a voyage

127
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,690
- to the Fountain...
- What?

128
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:43,274
Will someone please remove
these infernal chains?

129
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:45,070
Come, come.

130
00:11:47,505 --> 00:11:49,572
We know
you're in possession of a map.

131
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,867
So, confiscate the map,
and to the gallows with him!

132
00:11:53,514 --> 00:11:55,262
Have you a map?

133
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:02,605
- No.
- Where is it?

134
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:06,232
The truth? I lost it.

135
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:10,299
- Quite recently, in fact.
- I have a report.

136
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,138
The Spanish have located
the Fountain of Youth.

137
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:19,235
I will not have some
melancholy Spanish monarch,

138
00:12:19,745 --> 00:12:24,351
a Catholic, gain eternal life!

139
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,120
You do know the way
to the Fountain?

140
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,024
Of course I do.
Look at me.

141
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:33,160
You could guide an expedition.

142
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,400
you will be providing, then, a ship...

143
00:12:42,286 --> 00:12:46,824
- and a crew?
- And a captain.

144
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,908
Afternoon, sire.

145
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:09,305
If I may be so bold,
why is that man not in chains?

146
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:11,194
He must be manacled at once.

147
00:13:11,605 --> 00:13:14,893
At the center of my palace?
Hardly.

148
00:13:15,717 --> 00:13:16,896
Hector.

149
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:21,205
How nice to see a fellow pirate
make good of himself.

150
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:24,100
Pirate? Nay. Privateer.

151
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:30,165
On a sanctioned mission under
the authority and protection of the Crown.

152
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:32,633
As may be, but first...

153
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:36,222
what has become of my beloved Pearl?

154
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:39,307
I lost the Pearl. As I lost my leg.

155
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,759
- Lost the Pearl?
- Aye.

156
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:46,060
I defended her mightily enough,
but she be sunk nonetheless.

157
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:56,241
If that ship be sunk properly,
you should be sunk with it.

158
00:13:56,405 --> 00:14:01,601
Captain Barbossa, each second we tarry,
the Spanish outdistance us.

159
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,710
I have every confidence
you will prevail and be rewarded

160
00:14:04,884 --> 00:14:07,524
with the high station you so desire.

161
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:12,458
- To serve doth suffice, sire.
- You, sir, have stooped.

162
00:14:13,406 --> 00:14:15,904
Jack, our sands be all but run.

163
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:18,784
Where's the harm
in joinin' the winnin' side?

164
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:22,932
And you do meet
a nicer class of person.

165
00:14:23,593 --> 00:14:25,244
I understand everything.

166
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:28,589
Except that wig.

167
00:14:35,086 --> 00:14:37,658
He's getting away!
Stop him!

168
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:41,417
- Head him off!
- No! Stop that pirate!

169
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Come down!

170
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:18,525
- He escaped?
- Leave it to me, sire.

171
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:26,920
Guards! Guards!

172
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:52,040
- Arms at ready!
- Aye, sir!

173
00:15:59,255 --> 00:16:00,428
Find him!

174
00:16:22,645 --> 00:16:24,385
Finders keepers!

175
00:16:24,563 --> 00:16:25,769
There!

176
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:50,831
Is that it?

177
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,740
Stop that carriage!

178
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Head him off!

179
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:09,323
Out of the way!

180
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:38,337
Stop that pirate!

181
00:17:40,513 --> 00:17:42,049
Move out of the way!

182
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:50,019
Stop that man!

183
00:17:51,483 --> 00:17:52,689
Don't let him get away!

184
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:02,419
Fire!

185
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:34,178
He's getting away!
After 'im! Stop 'im!

186
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:38,457
After 'im!

187
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:51,204
Filthy pirate.

188
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:03,269
Hello, Jackie.

189
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:07,669
Hello, dad.

190
00:19:15,876 --> 00:19:18,076
I heard
you're puttin' together a crew.

191
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,276
If enough people keep saying it,
it must be true.

192
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:24,188
I heard where you're headed.
The Fountain.

193
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:26,152
Have you been there?

194
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,992
Does this face look like
it's been to the Fountain of Youth?

195
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,619
- Depends on the light.
- Son, the Fountain.

196
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:38,580
There'll be items required
for the profane ritual.

197
00:19:39,016 --> 00:19:40,638
Two chalices.

198
00:19:41,403 --> 00:19:44,733
- On the map, there was a chalice.
- Two. Silver.

199
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,235
From the Ponce de Leon ship.
You'll need both.

200
00:19:48,735 --> 00:19:51,306
- For?
- The ritual. Don't be a fool, Jackie.

201
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:54,513
Find out every detail
before you set sail.

202
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:56,518
Oh, set sail. Love to.

203
00:19:56,689 --> 00:19:58,868
But for that, I may need a ship.

204
00:19:59,588 --> 00:20:02,795
Those folk, over there,
they have a ship.

205
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:05,495
They're signin' up sailors
right now.

206
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:12,422
And one last thing, Jackie.

207
00:20:13,372 --> 00:20:17,197
The Fountain will test you.
Mark my words.

208
00:20:39,251 --> 00:20:41,229
I hear you be recruiting a crew.

209
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:43,223
Aye. That is,

210
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,231
Jack Sparrow be puttin' together
a modest venture.

211
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,633
You got some nerve, ain't ya?
Turnin' up here dressed like that?

212
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:55,242
What are you,
some kind of impostor?

213
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,055
Have you any idea who I am, mate?

214
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,370
Oi, muckers!

215
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:04,598
There's a bloke here
what's forgotten his own name!

216
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:11,479
Lads, I'm sailing with Sparrow.
Who'll buy a sailor a drink?

217
00:21:14,124 --> 00:21:15,567
Oi, who's next?

218
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:25,878
Bring us
some more of those ones.

219
00:21:26,403 --> 00:21:27,956
Yeah, make it four.

220
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:41,356
You've stolen me,
and I'm here to take meself back.

221
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:15,948
Stop doing that.

222
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,972
Only one person alive
knows that move.

223
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:00,561
Always wanted to do that.

224
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,644
Hello, Angelica.

225
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:10,156
Hello, Jack. Are you impressed?

226
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,144
I think I almost killed you
once or twice there.

227
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:16,743
I'm touched
at this most sincerest form of flattery.

228
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,424
But why?

229
00:24:21,466 --> 00:24:24,502
You were the only pirate
I thought I would pass for.

230
00:24:24,693 --> 00:24:26,097
That is not a compliment.

231
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:31,783
Don't worry, Jack.
I forgave you a long time ago.

232
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,847
- For what? For leaving you?
- Recall that I left you.

233
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:41,441
A gentleman allows a lady
to maintain her fictions.

234
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:44,910
Look, Sparrow. As long as
my sailors get their money,

235
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,578
they're willing to put up
with any number of peculiarities.

236
00:24:48,678 --> 00:24:52,571
Ah!... There is one peculiarity
with which I will not put up with.

237
00:24:53,874 --> 00:24:56,882
I will be impersonated
as "captain". Nothing less.

238
00:24:56,982 --> 00:25:01,585
Well, for that, you need a ship,
and, as it turns out, I have one.

239
00:25:02,644 --> 00:25:03,891
I could use a ship.

240
00:25:04,717 --> 00:25:07,074
I hear tell
you've been to the Fountain.

241
00:25:07,245 --> 00:25:09,566
There be a lot of hear-telling
going on these days.

242
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:14,033
- The Fountain of Youth.
- Dearest Angelica, fret not.

243
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,168
You still have
a few usable years left.

244
00:25:17,268 --> 00:25:20,348
Ah... Always so charming.

245
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:21,672
You didn't answer me.

246
00:25:21,843 --> 00:25:24,380
Aye. Ah, regarding the Fountain.
Waste of time, really...

247
00:25:24,554 --> 00:25:28,439
Milady, I see unseamanlike fellows
of an officious-looking nature.

248
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,924
Wretched pirates!
Find 'em! Maggots!

249
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:36,331
Friends of yours?

250
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,575
I may have unintentionally
slighted some king or other.

251
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:41,217
Open it!

252
00:25:41,317 --> 00:25:44,040
- Yeah, you haven't changed.
- Implying the need?

253
00:25:44,955 --> 00:25:45,814
Yes.

254
00:25:45,914 --> 00:25:47,211
Open this door,
in the name of His Majesty.

255
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:50,659
You betrayed me.
You seduced me and you used me.

256
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,536
I was innocent of the ways of men.

257
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:55,971
You demonstrated a lot of technique
for someone I supposedly corrupted.

258
00:25:56,126 --> 00:25:58,868
Imminent danger.
Here, now, milady!

259
00:25:59,046 --> 00:26:00,368
Open it!

260
00:26:01,444 --> 00:26:04,387
I was ready to take my vows.
And you...

261
00:26:04,986 --> 00:26:07,126
What were you doing in
a Spanish convent, anyway?

262
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:10,237
Mistook it for a brothel.
Honest mistake.

263
00:26:13,978 --> 00:26:16,281
- There he is!
- Over there!

264
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:35,950
We are at a disadvantage.

265
00:26:36,427 --> 00:26:39,467
Speak for yourself.
Unlike some who pretend to be,

266
00:26:40,078 --> 00:26:41,544
but cannot,
in fact, hold a candle to,

267
00:26:41,644 --> 00:26:43,473
I am captain Jack Sparrow.

268
00:27:20,479 --> 00:27:22,594
How can you say I used you?

269
00:27:23,244 --> 00:27:28,067
- You know... exactly... how.
- I know, but how can you say it?

270
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:36,108
- So, what is it?
- What is what?

271
00:27:36,726 --> 00:27:38,216
About the Fountain.

272
00:27:41,115 --> 00:27:42,281
What do you know?

273
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:45,536
You don't happen
to be in possession

274
00:27:45,636 --> 00:27:49,208
of two silver chalices,
circa Ponce de Leon?

275
00:27:49,843 --> 00:27:51,361
- No.
- Ha, thought not.

276
00:27:51,532 --> 00:27:55,116
- Why?
- I hear stories...

277
00:27:55,588 --> 00:27:56,714
Rumors...

278
00:27:57,435 --> 00:27:59,851
You are, of course,
aware of the ritual.

279
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:01,406
Yes, I am.

280
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,899
What is it?
What is required?

281
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,648
A mermaid, Jack.

282
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,468
There's been a mistake.

283
00:28:22,821 --> 00:28:26,869
It's a life sentence...
not death. Life!

284
00:28:31,853 --> 00:28:34,630
- Barbossa!
- Thank you, gentlemen.

285
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,852
I trust
you can tie a noose.

286
00:28:38,461 --> 00:28:39,568
That's a hard thing,

287
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,187
forcin' a man to twist
his own hangin' rope.

288
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:46,688
You must lie in your bed
the way you made it.

289
00:28:48,514 --> 00:28:49,586
What's happened to you?

290
00:28:49,784 --> 00:28:53,475
- Where be Jack Sparrow?
- He escaped.

291
00:28:53,575 --> 00:28:54,775
I'm on a tight schedule, Gibbs.

292
00:28:54,886 --> 00:28:57,218
The HMS Providence
sets sail at first light.

293
00:28:57,389 --> 00:28:59,958
If you do not care to watch it
hangin' here dead,

294
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:01,921
with a mouth full of flies...

295
00:29:03,353 --> 00:29:05,215
speak now.

296
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:09,754
Take me with you.
Any point of the compass...

297
00:29:09,854 --> 00:29:14,543
Take you where, Gibbs?
The Fountain? Aye?

298
00:29:14,895 --> 00:29:16,886
Is that where Jack be headed?

299
00:29:17,492 --> 00:29:20,811
Have you anything
you can offer me, Gibbs?

300
00:29:21,662 --> 00:29:23,502
Anything at all?

301
00:29:25,525 --> 00:29:28,490
Upon me naked word,
you'll not see the dawn.

302
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,319
Hand it over.

303
00:29:43,228 --> 00:29:45,253
- You fool!
- I had just enough time

304
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,893
to study those infernal circles.

305
00:29:48,064 --> 00:29:53,079
Every route, every destination.
All safe... in here.

306
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:58,585
Welcome back to His Majesty's navy,
master Gibbs.

307
00:30:12,134 --> 00:30:14,873
- Show a leg, sailor!
- Aye, sir.

308
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,455
What?

309
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:20,768
- There's been a horrible mistake.
- Keep moving.

310
00:30:22,772 --> 00:30:25,460
- I'm not supposed to be here.
- Many a man's woken up at sea,

311
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:27,387
no idea what, when,
wherefore or why.

312
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:29,893
No memory of the night afore,
whence he signed up

313
00:30:29,993 --> 00:30:31,429
and drank away
all 'is bonus money.

314
00:30:31,895 --> 00:30:33,562
No, no, no.
You don't understand, mate.

315
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:36,099
I'm captain Jack Sparrow.
The original. The only.

316
00:30:36,277 --> 00:30:39,258
Scrum, and the pleasure's all mine.
Now, keep moving.

317
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:48,860
Scrum.

318
00:30:49,384 --> 00:30:50,817
Get your elbows in!

319
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:55,900
Why is there a glass coffin?

320
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,523
Do I look like a man in charge?

321
00:30:58,642 --> 00:31:01,211
- Where am I?
- 'Scuse me, captain Sparrow, sir.

322
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:02,986
I be right honored
to welcome you aboard

323
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:06,863
our world-renowned vessel of infamy,
Queen Anne's Revenge.

324
00:31:10,007 --> 00:31:11,520
Blackbeard.

325
00:31:28,384 --> 00:31:29,384
Work!

326
00:31:33,801 --> 00:31:37,606
- He's a curious one.
- He's been zombiefied.

327
00:31:38,114 --> 00:31:40,155
- Eh?
- Zombiefied.

328
00:31:40,402 --> 00:31:44,003
Blackbeard's doing.
All the officers are the same.

329
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:45,876
Makes 'em more compliant.

330
00:31:47,313 --> 00:31:49,197
And perpetually ill-tempered.

331
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:52,941
- Come on. Scrub.
- Yeah.

332
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:03,749
Pull! Pull! Pull!

333
00:32:09,104 --> 00:32:11,057
Five days underway,
at least.

334
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:14,271
Aye. You can tell that
by the smell of the sea?

335
00:32:15,425 --> 00:32:16,821
Smell of the crew.

336
00:32:20,686 --> 00:32:25,766
Oi. What did that poor sod do?
And how can I make sure to not?

337
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:28,255
Him? Churchly fellow.

338
00:32:28,486 --> 00:32:30,213
Always goin' on
about the Lord Almighty.

339
00:32:30,577 --> 00:32:34,114
- Bible-thumper on this ship?
- A missionary is his story.

340
00:32:34,506 --> 00:32:37,018
What I heard was
he got captured in a raid.

341
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:40,022
Rest o' the ship got killed,
but not 'im.

342
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,718
First mate wouldn't let it happen

343
00:32:41,818 --> 00:32:44,158
on account of his premier standing
with the Lord.

344
00:32:44,926 --> 00:32:48,248
A first mate stickin' her neck...
for some prisoner.

345
00:32:49,206 --> 00:32:53,668
- That... you don't see.
- "Her"? First mate is a "her"?

346
00:32:53,768 --> 00:32:55,017
Back to work!

347
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:05,822
Steady as she goes.

348
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:25,353
You are a ruthless,
soulless, cross-grained cur.

349
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:28,610
- I told you I had a ship.
- No, Blackbeard has a ship,

350
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,475
upon which I am now imprisoned.

351
00:33:32,305 --> 00:33:33,838
We can do this, Jack.

352
00:33:34,084 --> 00:33:38,009
The Fountain of Youth,
like you always wanted.

353
00:33:38,801 --> 00:33:43,009
Blackbeard. Edward Teach,
the pirate all pirates fear.

354
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:45,954
Resurrector of the dead
in his spare time.

355
00:33:46,374 --> 00:33:49,404
- He will listen to me.
- He listens to no one.

356
00:33:49,752 --> 00:33:52,002
Maybe to his own daughter?

357
00:33:54,837 --> 00:33:57,690
Daughter as in... beget by?

358
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:01,903
Long-lost. Recently found.

359
00:34:02,356 --> 00:34:05,910
Who loves her dear papa
with all her soul.

360
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:08,831
- He bought that?
- I sold that.

361
00:34:16,085 --> 00:34:17,725
Then, it's the Fountain of Youth
for him,

362
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:20,819
or him and you... not you and me.

363
00:34:21,132 --> 00:34:23,260
No, Jack, that's the best part.

364
00:34:23,534 --> 00:34:24,992
He will be dead.

365
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:28,722
Ah... You'll be handling
that part yourself, then?

366
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,949
There is a prophecy.

367
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:33,789
Maybe you don't believe
in the supernatural.

368
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:36,105
Oh, no, no.
I've seen a thing or two.

369
00:34:38,982 --> 00:34:42,295
The prophecy... is this:

370
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:46,181
Blackbeard will meet his death
within a fortnight

371
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:49,838
at the hands of a one-legged man.

372
00:34:50,544 --> 00:34:52,847
That's why
he needs the Fountain, Jack.

373
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:11,622
Oh, master Gibbs, short we are a map.

374
00:35:11,894 --> 00:35:15,066
Perhaps you'd be so kind
as to provide us an heading.

375
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:20,953
Be a gem and pour me a gulper.

376
00:35:21,116 --> 00:35:24,539
Nay. We be privateers,
not pirates, master Gibbs.

377
00:35:24,673 --> 00:35:26,990
And in the King's name,
we behave as such.

378
00:35:27,178 --> 00:35:29,456
Aye... captain.

379
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:40,505
- Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?
- Aye, it be proper. There's your proof.

380
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,635
The Spaniard.

381
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:55,002
All hands! Battle stations!
Get to windward!

382
00:35:55,102 --> 00:35:57,795
- All hands, windward!
- Harden up two points!

383
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:01,414
- Two points!
- Cast loose the cannons!

384
00:36:05,608 --> 00:36:09,103
- Gunners, take posts!
- Take position! Gunners ready, sir!

385
00:36:09,273 --> 00:36:13,107
- Out! Thrust!
- Await orders.

386
00:36:15,598 --> 00:36:16,744
Steady!

387
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,840
Guns armed,
awaiting orders, sir.

388
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:28,641
Sir. Orders, sir?

389
00:36:35,847 --> 00:36:38,267
He never so much
as turned his head.

390
00:36:38,385 --> 00:36:40,216
The Fountain is the prize.

391
00:36:40,387 --> 00:36:43,860
It appears we be not even worth
the time it'd take to sink us.

392
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:48,576
And now, we've fallen behind.
All hands, make more sail!

393
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,724
All hands, more sail!

394
00:36:50,897 --> 00:36:54,185
Ride hard between wind and tide!

395
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:07,671
The topic, gentlemen... is mutiny.

396
00:37:08,813 --> 00:37:10,321
Mutiny most foul.

397
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,992
Aye. I signed up to sail
under Jack Sparrow, not some pretender.

398
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,410
And a lady, at that.

399
00:37:15,588 --> 00:37:17,788
And mention was failed to
be made of this uncanny crew.

400
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:20,256
Make my toes curl, they do.

401
00:37:20,426 --> 00:37:23,621
I got 'em. All of them.

402
00:37:23,721 --> 00:37:25,549
- Well done.
- Good lad.

403
00:37:25,723 --> 00:37:28,128
On to it, then. Blackbeard.

404
00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:30,721
- What are his habits?
- Stays mostly to his cabin.

405
00:37:30,895 --> 00:37:33,034
That's right, mostly to his cabin.

406
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:37,306
- Yes, but when he comes out...
- He don't really come out.

407
00:37:39,371 --> 00:37:40,411
He must come out sometime.

408
00:37:41,374 --> 00:37:43,020
Not really, no.

409
00:37:45,426 --> 00:37:46,945
Any of you sail with him before?

410
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,529
- No, no.
- I've never.

411
00:37:48,704 --> 00:37:49,704
Definitely not.

412
00:37:49,872 --> 00:37:53,706
- Any of you seen him before?
- Not really, no.

413
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:57,818
Stays to his cabin,
no one sailed with him,

414
00:37:57,918 --> 00:37:59,228
no one's seen him...

415
00:38:00,098 --> 00:38:03,409
Good news, gentlemen.
This is not Blackbeard's ship.

416
00:38:03,624 --> 00:38:04,988
This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge.

417
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:07,398
No, no, this be the Queen Anne's Revenge,
right enough.

418
00:38:07,904 --> 00:38:08,979
How do you know?

419
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:11,976
I've seen the name,
on the back o' the ship.

420
00:38:15,872 --> 00:38:20,752
Gentlemen, sirs, fellow conscriptees...

421
00:38:22,245 --> 00:38:24,460
you have been monstrously deceived.

422
00:38:24,664 --> 00:38:27,789
- We are decepted, then?
- Yes.

423
00:38:28,961 --> 00:38:31,360
You've nay been informed
of a destination.

424
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:38,342
Death lies before us
as we sail... for the Fountain of Youth.

425
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:42,124
It would be a sorry plight, mates.

426
00:38:42,299 --> 00:38:46,383
- Death, for certain.
- The garden of darkened souls.

427
00:38:46,553 --> 00:38:49,064
- Untimely our ends will be.
- Unless...

428
00:38:50,525 --> 00:38:52,334
we take the ship.

429
00:38:53,893 --> 00:38:56,970
We take the ship, then. Now!

430
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,092
Go on, then.

431
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:06,561
- Help me, shipmates!
- Give it to 'em!

432
00:39:07,104 --> 00:39:08,947
- Wake up! It's ours!
- Come on!

433
00:39:09,117 --> 00:39:10,732
Get up! Off your backside!

434
00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:14,661
- Get off your fannies!
- Take it to them, lads!

435
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:17,014
Help me! Fight!

436
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:31,730
Jack.

437
00:39:33,265 --> 00:39:37,969
If this is a dream,
you can keep the sword and boots on.

438
00:39:40,022 --> 00:39:42,513
- If it's not...
- It's a dream.

439
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,625
No, it's not!

440
00:39:50,853 --> 00:39:53,413
I thought I should give you
fair warning, we're taking the ship.

441
00:39:54,557 --> 00:39:55,646
Nothing personal.

442
00:39:56,975 --> 00:39:58,898
Think you might be better off
if you just...

443
00:40:00,616 --> 00:40:01,802
stay out of it.

444
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,828
Boggit.

445
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,363
Wretch!

446
00:41:19,294 --> 00:41:20,951
You're either with us
or against us!

447
00:41:21,122 --> 00:41:23,283
I'm not with you,
neither am I against you!

448
00:41:24,272 --> 00:41:25,297
Can he do that?

449
00:41:25,397 --> 00:41:27,759
He's religious.
I believe it's required.

450
00:41:33,467 --> 00:41:36,573
Fight to the bitter end,
you cack-handed deck apes!

451
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:50,880
Take him, men.
Tie him down tight!

452
00:42:05,582 --> 00:42:07,093
The ship is ours!

453
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,009
Gentlemen.

454
00:42:46,176 --> 00:42:48,702
I be placed in a bewilderment.

455
00:42:49,676 --> 00:42:53,220
There I were... resting,

456
00:42:54,256 --> 00:42:59,278
and upon a sudden,
I hear an ungodly row on deck.

457
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:06,790
Sailors abandon their posts
without orders, without leave.

458
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:13,843
Men before the mast...
taking the ship for themselves.

459
00:43:15,512 --> 00:43:17,478
What be that, first mate?

460
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:20,751
- Mutiny, captain.
- Again?

461
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,172
- Mutiny!
- Aye.

462
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,862
Mutiny.

463
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:31,827
And what fate befalls mutineers?

464
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:35,493
Now, we know the answer to that,
do we not?

465
00:43:35,937 --> 00:43:38,746
Mutineers hang!

466
00:44:29,313 --> 00:44:31,176
Captain,
I wish to report a mutiny.

467
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:35,734
- I can name fingers and point names.
- No need, Mr. Sparrow.

468
00:44:35,951 --> 00:44:38,896
They are sheep.
You, their shepherd.

469
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:46,954
Have I mentioned, sir,
what a lovely daughter you have?

470
00:44:47,424 --> 00:44:49,570
A fitting last sight for a doomed soul.

471
00:44:49,744 --> 00:44:52,304
Remember, father.
We need him.

472
00:44:52,404 --> 00:44:53,914
If I don't kill a man
every now and then,

473
00:44:54,014 --> 00:44:56,281
- they forget who I am.
- Coward!

474
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:57,679
Hm?

475
00:44:58,216 --> 00:44:59,645
They do not forget.

476
00:45:00,453 --> 00:45:03,221
Your crew sees you
for the miscreant you are.

477
00:45:03,389 --> 00:45:05,085
A coward,
no matter how many you slay.

478
00:45:05,259 --> 00:45:07,625
Twice in one day,
I find myself in a bewilderment.

479
00:45:07,804 --> 00:45:09,920
You are not bewildered,
you are afraid.

480
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,141
You dare not walk the path of
righteousness, the way of the light.

481
00:45:13,241 --> 00:45:16,294
No, sir. The truth is,
it be much simpler than all that.

482
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,347
- I am a bad man.
- That, too.

483
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,986
I might have
to kill you too, catechist.

484
00:45:23,086 --> 00:45:25,454
- No!
- All Latin blood like her mother.

485
00:45:25,554 --> 00:45:26,960
Father, I beg you.

486
00:45:27,998 --> 00:45:31,332
There I be again,
forgetting why the missionary is here.

487
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:35,630
My daughter... fears for my soul,
or what's left of it.

488
00:45:37,104 --> 00:45:40,215
You truly wish to save me,
my child?

489
00:45:40,893 --> 00:45:45,573
- Every soul can be saved.
- Be that true, young cleric?

490
00:45:45,848 --> 00:45:49,582
Yes. Though you I see
as a bit of a long shot.

491
00:45:50,688 --> 00:45:54,703
Still, I pray for every unfortunate soul
on this hell-bound vessel.

492
00:45:57,485 --> 00:45:59,820
You disarm me with your faith.

493
00:46:01,198 --> 00:46:02,595
Eight bells!

494
00:46:02,827 --> 00:46:05,898
Which of you unfortunate souls
stood watch?

495
00:46:06,161 --> 00:46:10,759
- I did. I stood watch.
- Gunner.

496
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,377
You?

497
00:46:18,505 --> 00:46:19,633
Aye.

498
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:21,989
Aye.

499
00:46:22,595 --> 00:46:23,978
The cook.

500
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:27,521
Perfect. Lower the longboat!

501
00:46:32,867 --> 00:46:34,405
Bring her about!

502
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,018
- Why do you do this?
- Mutiny. Our laws be clear.

503
00:46:49,393 --> 00:46:51,873
Our laws allow the captain
to show leniency.

504
00:46:51,981 --> 00:46:54,197
I've given this man
a chance to determine his fate,

505
00:46:54,367 --> 00:46:56,381
a gift not afforded to all.

506
00:47:05,379 --> 00:47:06,717
Oh, you, now.

507
00:47:07,922 --> 00:47:10,504
Chance to show
the worth of your prayers.

508
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:15,196
Pray he be delivered from... evil?

509
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:24,393
Course made!

510
00:47:24,563 --> 00:47:26,747
Stop. Give that man a chance.
Give yourself a...

511
00:47:52,313 --> 00:47:54,772
You know when
I feel closest to our Maker?

512
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,716
When I see suffering,
pain and anguish.

513
00:47:56,887 --> 00:47:59,750
That's when the true design
of this world is revealed.

514
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,220
And I see it revealed when,
in times of hardship and tragedy,

515
00:48:03,455 --> 00:48:05,635
kindness and compassion
are shown to those in need.

516
00:48:05,813 --> 00:48:08,179
Perhaps you should pray
for him to be unharmed, yes?

517
00:48:08,701 --> 00:48:10,828
- Please, there's still hope...
- Again!

518
00:48:23,504 --> 00:48:25,825
I actually have
no interest in the Fountain whatsoever,

519
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:28,257
so, if your heart is set,

520
00:48:28,775 --> 00:48:30,732
you may drop me off
anywhere you like.

521
00:48:30,832 --> 00:48:32,489
That'll be all, quartermaster.

522
00:48:35,435 --> 00:48:38,591
Your words surround you like fog
and make you hard to see.

523
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:42,028
And what of you,
the mighty Blackbeard?

524
00:48:42,657 --> 00:48:45,466
Beheaded they say.
Still, your body swam

525
00:48:45,643 --> 00:48:49,113
three times around your ship,
then climbed back onboard.

526
00:48:49,445 --> 00:48:52,194
And here you are,
running scared.

527
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:55,850
- Scared...
- To the Fountain.

528
00:48:56,331 --> 00:48:59,363
The quartermaster
sees things before they happen.

529
00:48:59,463 --> 00:49:03,516
He has foreseen my death,
and so the fates have spoken.

530
00:49:04,052 --> 00:49:06,444
The threads of destiny woven.

531
00:49:06,591 --> 00:49:09,564
You have a ridiculously
high regard for fate, mate.

532
00:49:09,742 --> 00:49:11,368
- And you?
- Me?

533
00:49:11,821 --> 00:49:15,412
I'm skeptical of predicting
any future... which includes me.

534
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:21,535
It'd be foolish to battle fate,
but I'd be tempted... to cheat it.

535
00:49:21,979 --> 00:49:24,819
I will reach the Fountain.
You will lead me.

536
00:49:27,023 --> 00:49:30,993
That knife will serve you no better
than the mutiny you devised.

537
00:49:31,373 --> 00:49:35,000
Mutiny served me well.
It gained me an audience with you.

538
00:49:36,158 --> 00:49:38,283
- Oh.
- Aye.

539
00:49:39,681 --> 00:49:40,953
To warn you.

540
00:49:42,509 --> 00:49:46,717
Regarding your first mate,
who pretends to be persons she is not.

541
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,804
Do tell.

542
00:49:51,232 --> 00:49:52,882
She is not your daughter.

543
00:49:56,295 --> 00:49:59,357
You dare to speak
thusly of my flesh and blood?

544
00:49:59,457 --> 00:50:03,835
Sir... the woman is consummate
in the art of deception.

545
00:50:04,317 --> 00:50:08,797
I know. As I mostly unwittingly
set her on her wicked path.

546
00:50:08,961 --> 00:50:10,511
Though I cannot claim credit

547
00:50:11,277 --> 00:50:13,868
for her existing abundance
of natural talent.

548
00:50:15,649 --> 00:50:18,273
Angelica.
My beloved daughter,

549
00:50:18,373 --> 00:50:20,789
the one true good thing
I have done in this life,

550
00:50:20,889 --> 00:50:23,546
and you claim to be the one
who corrupted her?

551
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:27,835
Sir, what she is is pure evil.

552
00:50:28,254 --> 00:50:30,361
More to be feared
than a wild beast.

553
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:34,312
Hungry wild beast
with gnashing teeth.

554
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:38,042
- Vengeful, hungry from hell beast...
- Father!

555
00:50:38,142 --> 00:50:39,142
Sweetness!

556
00:50:40,987 --> 00:50:42,292
No need to hurt him, father.

557
00:50:43,366 --> 00:50:46,103
He will help us. Won't you, Jack?

558
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:49,981
You see? Even now,
she attends to your welfare,

559
00:50:50,527 --> 00:50:53,236
giving lie to the claims
you make of her.

560
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:05,743
You will lead us
to the Fountain. Yes?

561
00:51:06,457 --> 00:51:07,705
Put another way.

562
00:51:08,684 --> 00:51:12,338
If I... do not make it
to the Fountain in time...

563
00:51:14,281 --> 00:51:16,863
neither... will you.

564
00:51:18,949 --> 00:51:22,364
I'll have a wee look-see at those charts
straight away then, shall I?

565
00:51:27,024 --> 00:51:28,024
Sir.

566
00:51:31,105 --> 00:51:33,357
- Aye?
- Captain, sir,

567
00:51:33,568 --> 00:51:35,717
I am unhappy to report rumors, sir,

568
00:51:36,111 --> 00:51:38,469
among the crew,
as to our destination.

569
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:41,663
Shut your trap and make way.

570
00:51:45,555 --> 00:51:49,602
- That's the way of it, then.
- No disrespect... sir.

571
00:51:49,702 --> 00:51:52,795
What do the men fear?
Say it. Speak the words.

572
00:51:53,287 --> 00:51:58,007
- Whitecap Bay.
- Aye, Whitecap Bay.

573
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,188
And every worthless seaman
fears the name, and rightly so,

574
00:52:02,288 --> 00:52:04,695
though few know why
or dare to ask.

575
00:52:04,795 --> 00:52:06,523
Be the stories true?

576
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,487
Say what robs you of
your staunch heart, Gibbs,

577
00:52:08,587 --> 00:52:11,870
or forever leave it
to the wider fields of fancy.

578
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:18,151
- Mermaids, cap'n.
- Aye. Mermaids.

579
00:52:18,496 --> 00:52:22,489
Sea ghouls, devil fish,
dreadful in hunger for flesh of man.

580
00:52:22,785 --> 00:52:25,775
Mermaid waters, that be our path.

581
00:52:26,405 --> 00:52:27,521
Cling to your soul, Gibbs,

582
00:52:27,695 --> 00:52:30,918
as mermaids be given
to take the rest...

583
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,063
to the bone.

584
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:37,722
Steady! Steady, men!
Find your courage,

585
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:39,998
or be ready
to purpose your fear!

586
00:52:40,098 --> 00:52:42,172
Save yourselves!

587
00:52:45,096 --> 00:52:47,587
- Man overboard!
- Nay! A deserter.

588
00:52:47,757 --> 00:52:49,647
- Come about.
- Nay!

589
00:52:50,802 --> 00:52:54,661
Gentlemen... I shall not ask
any more of any man than

590
00:52:54,761 --> 00:52:59,695
what that man can deliver,
but I do ask this: Are we not King's men?

591
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,240
Aye.

592
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,721
- On the King's mission?
- Aye.

593
00:53:03,898 --> 00:53:08,284
I did not note any fear in the eyes
of the Spanish as they passed us by.

594
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,985
- Are we not King's men?
- Aye!

595
00:53:11,156 --> 00:53:14,067
Aye! Hands all off,
and bear away!

596
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:17,478
Stave on ahead to Whitecap Bay!

597
00:53:19,086 --> 00:53:21,467
Bear on, Whitecap Bay!

598
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:34,271
Hola!

599
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,613
Come. Little drink?

600
00:53:38,493 --> 00:53:41,216
Wine, music, candlelight.

601
00:53:41,827 --> 00:53:44,371
I think we've travelled
down this road before, Jack.

602
00:53:44,656 --> 00:53:45,886
Yes, we have.

603
00:53:47,086 --> 00:53:48,535
I remember it well.

604
00:53:50,326 --> 00:53:54,251
Winding, twisting and
turning, gyrating, writhing...

605
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:57,258
Incessant writhing...

606
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:59,793
Do you recall Saint Dominique?

607
00:54:00,776 --> 00:54:04,568
La Martinique.
I tried to kill you in Saint Dominique.

608
00:54:05,048 --> 00:54:06,299
Either or.

609
00:54:07,056 --> 00:54:09,314
Hardly appropriate for a first mate.

610
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:12,768
Was I the first?
I've often wondered.

611
00:54:13,558 --> 00:54:16,615
You can be so charming
when you want something, Jack.

612
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:19,506
The trick is finding out what.

613
00:54:20,764 --> 00:54:22,628
Truth, then, is it?

614
00:54:23,629 --> 00:54:25,934
Blackbeard has served his purpose.

615
00:54:26,259 --> 00:54:28,566
You and I can go
to the Fountain together,

616
00:54:28,824 --> 00:54:31,905
where we shall bathe one another
in equal shares of fame

617
00:54:32,224 --> 00:54:34,266
and other assorted debaucheries.

618
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,903
And I'll tell you
the ritual of the Fountain.

619
00:54:37,446 --> 00:54:40,209
Yes. The profane ritual.

620
00:54:42,889 --> 00:54:44,567
Can I trust you, Jack?

621
00:54:45,257 --> 00:54:49,388
- I need you on me side.
- Oh, my dearest Angelica.

622
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:52,910
You and I... are
as thick as thieves, love.

623
00:54:53,603 --> 00:54:55,296
Tell me the rules.

624
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:01,562
Water... from the Fountain of Youth.

625
00:55:03,277 --> 00:55:06,341
The shimmering tear of a mermaid.

626
00:55:07,116 --> 00:55:10,324
The silver chalices of Ponce de Leon.

627
00:55:11,996 --> 00:55:13,738
With these items...

628
00:55:13,847 --> 00:55:15,650
- Yes?
- With these items,

629
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:19,464
you may take all the years
of life from another, Jack.

630
00:55:20,959 --> 00:55:23,362
- Eh?
- You know what that means.

631
00:55:23,705 --> 00:55:26,006
We cannot go alone, you and I.

632
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,114
The ritual requires a victim.

633
00:55:30,585 --> 00:55:34,419
- That is unfortunate.
- Yes, it is.

634
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,541
I find my desire for the Fountain
greatly lessened.

635
00:55:39,706 --> 00:55:42,646
But there is something onboard
you do want.

636
00:55:48,482 --> 00:55:49,482
What about Blackbeard?

637
00:55:49,644 --> 00:55:53,228
He's in the chart room.
We'll have to be quick.

638
00:56:02,587 --> 00:56:05,249
He keeps each ship as a prize.

639
00:56:06,922 --> 00:56:11,449
You help me...
and I promise you your pick.

640
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:14,903
Though I think I know
the one you will choose.

641
00:56:20,694 --> 00:56:22,612
The Black Pearl in a bottle?

642
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:25,293
Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle?

643
00:56:30,983 --> 00:56:33,286
He's even more annoying
in miniature.

644
00:56:34,133 --> 00:56:37,454
- Do we have a deal, Jack?
- Angelica, I know you.

645
00:56:38,324 --> 00:56:41,080
You are not going to steal the life
of some innocent man.

646
00:56:41,537 --> 00:56:43,812
What about the one-legged man?

647
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,482
I need years, Jack.

648
00:56:49,588 --> 00:56:53,140
Not for me. For my father.

649
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:58,020
I am truly the daughter of Blackbeard.

650
00:56:59,118 --> 00:57:03,428
- You've fallen for your own con, love.
- No, he is my father.

651
00:57:03,682 --> 00:57:05,128
The lies I told you were not lies.

652
00:57:07,145 --> 00:57:09,530
You lied to me
by telling me the truth?

653
00:57:09,973 --> 00:57:11,964
- Yes.
- That's very good.

654
00:57:12,142 --> 00:57:14,554
- May I use that?
- I'm sure you will, anyway.

655
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:16,468
Mm, of course I will.

656
00:57:17,344 --> 00:57:19,425
So, will you not give up this quest?

657
00:57:20,786 --> 00:57:23,844
I want a father, Jack.
I haven't had one.

658
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:28,147
Angelica, your father, Blackbeard...

659
00:57:29,892 --> 00:57:33,702
he is evil,
and he will kill you given the chance.

660
00:57:33,802 --> 00:57:36,663
- He cannot be saved.
- And who are you to set

661
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:38,805
the limits on redemption?

662
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:42,457
You stole years of my life, Jack.
You owe me.

663
00:57:42,631 --> 00:57:45,696
And you are en route
to getting yourself killed,

664
00:57:46,154 --> 00:57:48,129
and I'm not inclined
to stand by and watch.

665
00:57:48,303 --> 00:57:52,012
Whitecap Bay!

666
00:57:57,363 --> 00:58:00,700
All hands on deck!
Set to the longboats!

667
00:58:04,951 --> 00:58:06,089
Lay 'em out flat!

668
00:58:06,538 --> 00:58:10,876
No tangles. Make 'em look pretty
for our dainty guests.

669
00:58:11,428 --> 00:58:15,271
We're gonna need light.
A lot of light.

670
00:58:17,097 --> 00:58:18,102
Come!

671
00:58:39,903 --> 00:58:44,856
Smell that? Whale oil.
Stuff burns like a miracle from God.

672
00:58:45,237 --> 00:58:48,715
- Can you make it work?
- Made by the English.

673
00:58:49,087 --> 00:58:50,482
Let's not get our hopes up.

674
00:59:01,281 --> 00:59:03,232
The old moon in
the arms of the new one.

675
00:59:03,385 --> 00:59:04,733
First of the summer.

676
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:08,686
Perfect for hunting a mermaid's tear.

677
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,638
We're doomed.
They be drawn to man-made light.

678
00:59:25,096 --> 00:59:27,863
- Sharks?
- Worse than sharks, boy.

679
00:59:27,963 --> 00:59:30,129
There'll be mermaids upon us
within the hour,

680
00:59:30,229 --> 00:59:33,875
you mark my words.
And we're the bait.

681
00:59:38,753 --> 00:59:42,071
I heard it said a kiss from a mermaid
protects a sailor from drowning.

682
00:59:42,249 --> 00:59:46,176
Don't be a fool!
Mermaids are all female, son,

683
00:59:46,528 --> 00:59:48,995
and lovely as a dream of heaven.

684
00:59:49,172 --> 00:59:53,160
But when it comes time
to churn butter, so to speak,

685
00:59:53,752 --> 00:59:55,738
they snatch a sailor out of a boat

686
00:59:55,838 --> 00:59:58,381
or off the deck of a ship,
have their way,

687
00:59:59,112 --> 01:00:04,187
and then the sailors are pulled
to bottom and drowned and eaten.

688
01:00:04,287 --> 01:00:07,684
Or, sometimes,
the other way around.

689
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:11,604
- Sing.
- What?

690
01:00:13,248 --> 01:00:15,329
They like to hear singing.

691
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:27,595
Louder.

692
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:23,337
Lord save me.

693
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:29,833
Man, look. Look there.

694
01:01:31,449 --> 01:01:34,130
- You'll scare her off!
- Aye, and good riddance!

695
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:40,354
Can you talk?

696
01:01:43,084 --> 01:01:44,250
Yes.

697
01:01:51,845 --> 01:01:53,472
You're beautiful.

698
01:01:54,772 --> 01:01:58,473
- Are you the one who sings?
- Aye.

699
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:03,506
Are you my jolly sailor bold?

700
01:02:06,173 --> 01:02:08,698
- Aye, that I be.
- Scrum, comport yourself!

701
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:11,308
Boys! There ain't much
been given to me

702
01:02:11,479 --> 01:02:14,123
in my brief, miserable life,
there's the truth in it.

703
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,729
But, by God, I'll have it said

704
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,267
that Scrum 'ad 'imself a kiss
from a proper mermaid!

705
01:04:04,349 --> 01:04:07,191
Out upon it! It has begun!

706
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,792
Light 'em up!

707
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:55,486
Muster your courage!
Drive 'em to shore!

708
01:05:06,161 --> 01:05:09,534
Nets into the water!
Quickly!

709
01:05:59,257 --> 01:06:02,010
Retreat, all, to land!
For your lives!

710
01:06:05,668 --> 01:06:07,033
Retreat, I say!

711
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:09,654
Cowards! Back in the water!

712
01:06:09,929 --> 01:06:13,544
There be no refuge on land!
On my word!

713
01:06:46,904 --> 01:06:48,112
Come on!

714
01:08:23,043 --> 01:08:24,409
We got one!

715
01:08:29,383 --> 01:08:30,683
I'm in love!

716
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:34,766
Check the wounded!

717
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:38,222
See if you can find
one mermaid still alive!

718
01:09:17,261 --> 01:09:18,547
Come, give a hand!

719
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,536
Well done, sailor.

720
01:09:22,971 --> 01:09:26,375
Did everyone see that?
Because I will not be doing it again.

721
01:09:26,547 --> 01:09:31,217
Back to the ship.
We head for a protected cove. Now.

722
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:50,944
- Lord! Is that...?
- Mermaid.

723
01:09:51,746 --> 01:09:54,657
- Give up this madness now.
- I cannot.

724
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,553
Ever walk on the beach,

725
01:09:56,653 --> 01:09:59,163
look back and see your footsteps
in the sand?

726
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:03,135
It's like that,
except the footsteps lie before me.

727
01:10:03,378 --> 01:10:07,293
- Footstep, actually.
- Whitecap Bay, sir.

728
01:10:07,434 --> 01:10:08,600
We must hasten.

729
01:10:17,115 --> 01:10:20,428
We travel by foot.
Gibbs, I require a head'n'.

730
01:10:20,528 --> 01:10:23,527
- But, sir, the men...
- They be dead already.

731
01:10:23,983 --> 01:10:26,992
- They don't sound dead.
- Oh, is that so?

732
01:10:27,092 --> 01:10:31,127
Well, I hear nothing
but seagulls nestin'.

733
01:10:31,514 --> 01:10:34,334
What is it that you hear,
Mr. Groves?

734
01:10:36,535 --> 01:10:39,367
Seagulls... nesting.

735
01:10:40,401 --> 01:10:43,552
- Nothing more.
- Heading, Gibbs?

736
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:53,471
My God!

737
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:55,610
Your head or my headin'.

738
01:10:55,787 --> 01:10:58,631
I'll have me one or t'other,
I don't care which.

739
01:11:03,454 --> 01:11:05,687
All hands, forward!

740
01:11:21,196 --> 01:11:25,785
- It's to you now, Sparrow.
- Was that really necessary?

741
01:11:26,033 --> 01:11:28,142
Best you not know
the exact whereabouts of my ship.

742
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,182
- I be a cautious man.
- So be I.

743
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:35,262
What I want first...

744
01:11:38,679 --> 01:11:40,874
is Ponce De Leon's ship.

745
01:12:17,967 --> 01:12:19,835
Why is it
we've got to bring her along?

746
01:12:20,026 --> 01:12:22,864
Because tears don't keep.
We need them fresh.

747
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:24,880
What is the ritual again?

748
01:12:26,032 --> 01:12:28,247
Water from the Fountain
and a mermaid's tear?

749
01:12:28,421 --> 01:12:29,911
And two silver chalices.

750
01:12:30,089 --> 01:12:32,824
One cup with a tear,
one without.

751
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:36,651
So, one with a tear
and water in both...

752
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:41,241
- Quite complicated, is it not?
- Both get water. One gets a tear.

753
01:12:41,603 --> 01:12:44,125
The person who drinks
the water with the tear

754
01:12:44,377 --> 01:12:47,041
gets all the years of life
from the other.

755
01:12:48,015 --> 01:12:49,797
How many years?

756
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:54,488
All the years
that they have lived,

757
01:12:54,974 --> 01:12:58,717
and they could have lived,
if fate had been... kinder.

758
01:13:07,637 --> 01:13:08,842
Clergyman.

759
01:13:10,894 --> 01:13:13,542
On the off chance that
this does not go well for me,

760
01:13:13,823 --> 01:13:15,263
I would like it noted,
here and now,

761
01:13:15,426 --> 01:13:18,627
that I am fully prepared
to believe in whatever I must,

762
01:13:19,046 --> 01:13:20,737
so that I may be
welcomed into that place

763
01:13:20,837 --> 01:13:23,139
where all the goody-goodies
get to go. Savvy?

764
01:13:23,449 --> 01:13:26,884
We have a word for that, Jack.
You can convert.

765
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:29,466
I was thinking more
of an as-needed basis.

766
01:13:33,792 --> 01:13:35,009
Quartermaster!

767
01:13:35,765 --> 01:13:37,375
- Aye?
- She cannot breathe!

768
01:13:37,537 --> 01:13:40,249
- She has water.
- She needs air!

769
01:13:44,502 --> 01:13:46,674
- Open this.
- She will escape.

770
01:13:47,141 --> 01:13:50,303
- You're killing her.
- I support the missionary's position.

771
01:13:58,984 --> 01:14:00,067
See?

772
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,201
Onward!

773
01:14:31,257 --> 01:14:34,481
Just as I thought.
Not this way!

774
01:14:36,644 --> 01:14:38,098
This is the way, isn't it?

775
01:14:38,263 --> 01:14:40,654
'Course it is, but we
should go around to the east.

776
01:14:40,754 --> 01:14:42,689
That would take us
out of the path of the chalices.

777
01:14:42,789 --> 01:14:44,649
- Well, then we'll circle back.
- There is no time.

778
01:14:44,749 --> 01:14:46,665
You're the one who insisted
on bringing the bloody mermaid.

779
01:14:46,765 --> 01:14:48,546
- Well, the mutiny didn't help.
- You walk like a girl.

780
01:14:48,646 --> 01:14:50,641
- You would know.
- Someone must go.

781
01:14:51,704 --> 01:14:53,409
You mean split up?

782
01:14:53,509 --> 01:14:56,264
You mean jump?
This I cannot wait to see.

783
01:14:56,580 --> 01:15:00,355
Sparrow will go.
Find the ship, retrieve the chalices.

784
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:02,541
Sparrow? What makes you
think he will come back?

785
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:05,685
Yes, what makes you think
he will come back?

786
01:15:06,221 --> 01:15:08,533
We cannot trust him, father.
I'll go.

787
01:15:09,413 --> 01:15:10,670
She'll go.

788
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:18,766
How much farther to the Fountain?
I'm running out of time.

789
01:15:20,477 --> 01:15:22,805
About a day's march north,
following that river,

790
01:15:22,912 --> 01:15:26,028
you'll get to a series of pools.
Then you're close.

791
01:15:28,599 --> 01:15:29,839
You will go.

792
01:15:33,127 --> 01:15:35,056
I was sure
it would come to this.

793
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:52,777
You know that feeling you get sometimes
when you're standing in a high place?

794
01:15:53,171 --> 01:15:54,866
Sudden urge to jump?

795
01:15:56,793 --> 01:15:58,329
I don't have it.

796
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:04,104
- I need those chalices.
- Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall.

797
01:16:04,289 --> 01:16:07,087
You will go. You will return...

798
01:16:08,563 --> 01:16:10,957
or I will kill her.

799
01:16:13,321 --> 01:16:14,951
You won't kill your own daughter.

800
01:16:15,051 --> 01:16:17,978
Quartermaster,
get me six more pistols,

801
01:16:18,078 --> 01:16:22,116
remove the shot from all but two,
but do not tell me which two.

802
01:16:24,587 --> 01:16:27,264
- You get to choose, Mr. Sparrow.
- Oh...

803
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:30,700
No.

804
01:16:33,697 --> 01:16:34,697
No.

805
01:16:37,423 --> 01:16:40,078
- Yes.
- You're sure?

806
01:16:40,426 --> 01:16:41,446
'Course I am.

807
01:16:50,448 --> 01:16:51,482
Again.

808
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,745
Please, they're not even loaded.

809
01:17:00,405 --> 01:17:01,583
Again.

810
01:17:02,306 --> 01:17:03,931
If you're so keen on killing her,

811
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:06,811
- why don't you just let her jump?
- What?!

812
01:17:07,494 --> 01:17:12,442
If you jump... and die...
then she will have her chance.

813
01:17:13,924 --> 01:17:14,960
Again.

814
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:19,600
Oi...

815
01:17:20,615 --> 01:17:24,468
If I jump... will I survive?

816
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:28,117
The doll.

817
01:17:44,624 --> 01:17:49,414
- Yes, now you will survive.
- This is nonsense! I'm going!

818
01:18:08,077 --> 01:18:11,020
Wet. Wet again.

819
01:18:13,602 --> 01:18:16,575
We go on.
Due north to the Fountain.

820
01:18:17,205 --> 01:18:18,388
Well played, father.

821
01:18:20,442 --> 01:18:22,531
You knew
which guns were loaded, right?

822
01:18:25,446 --> 01:18:27,281
Of course, my love.

823
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:41,252
- Be nice to have a map about now.
- Or a ship.

824
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:46,104
Stop! Hold very still.

825
01:18:47,536 --> 01:18:51,013
Ye dare not let it touch your skin.

826
01:18:59,859 --> 01:19:02,764
What? What be wrong with
an older man havin' a hobby?

827
01:19:03,128 --> 01:19:05,426
What are you stoppin' for, eh?
Push on!

828
01:19:05,751 --> 01:19:08,199
- Push on!
- You can sleep when you're dead.

829
01:19:08,332 --> 01:19:09,441
Push on!

830
01:19:10,947 --> 01:19:14,289
Fortune continues to favour us.

831
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:44,769
The Santiago.

832
01:19:44,869 --> 01:19:47,071
Famously captained by Ponce de Leon.

833
01:19:50,084 --> 01:19:52,210
There's no one there.
Right, then.

834
01:20:27,277 --> 01:20:28,747
We must not stop.

835
01:20:36,553 --> 01:20:38,016
You will walk.

836
01:20:57,734 --> 01:20:59,152
I cannot.

837
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:01,693
Walk or die.

838
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:09,097
Put your arms around me.

839
01:21:09,493 --> 01:21:12,634
- I do not ask for help.
- But you need it.

840
01:21:29,963 --> 01:21:34,071
- We're in a hurry, yes?
- Do not fall behind.

841
01:21:53,422 --> 01:21:55,164
Hold here till I say!

842
01:22:08,333 --> 01:22:09,623
Such beauty.

843
01:22:10,774 --> 01:22:13,012
Surely you're one of
God's own creations,

844
01:22:13,832 --> 01:22:16,409
and not a descendant
of those dark creatures

845
01:22:16,584 --> 01:22:18,803
who found no refuge on the Ark.

846
01:22:21,862 --> 01:22:23,372
Such beauty...

847
01:22:25,395 --> 01:22:26,728
and yet deadly.

848
01:22:27,727 --> 01:22:31,449
- Deadly? No.
- You attacked me.

849
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:36,569
No. You are different.

850
01:22:37,497 --> 01:22:42,330
- Different?
- Are you not? You protect.

851
01:22:45,905 --> 01:22:46,940
Did you...?

852
01:22:48,996 --> 01:22:50,957
You pushed me down
out of the way.

853
01:22:53,044 --> 01:22:57,258
- You see the Fountain?
- No, but we are close.

854
01:22:57,777 --> 01:22:59,414
Bring the creature.
Cover its head.

855
01:23:00,179 --> 01:23:01,564
She has a name!

856
01:23:06,355 --> 01:23:07,694
Pray tell.

857
01:23:14,149 --> 01:23:15,454
She is Syrena.

858
01:23:56,908 --> 01:23:58,304
Ponce de Leon.

859
01:24:02,243 --> 01:24:05,783
If 40 pirates
dreamt 40 nights of treasure,

860
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:09,577
it would not match
the contents of this room.

861
01:24:10,337 --> 01:24:11,337
You...

862
01:24:13,896 --> 01:24:15,958
- You.
- No...

863
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,313
- You...
- I was here first.

864
01:24:19,445 --> 01:24:23,429
- You, why are you here?
- Blackbeard sent me.

865
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:26,045
- Why are you?
- Silver chalices

866
01:24:26,145 --> 01:24:29,513
- for my royal liege.
- Oh, please.

867
01:24:30,817 --> 01:24:32,900
Back, back!
We have to balance it out!

868
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:36,954
The whole ship will slide!

869
01:24:40,897 --> 01:24:41,941
Right, then.

870
01:24:42,635 --> 01:24:48,393
What if... we each choose an item
of approximately equal weight?

871
01:24:51,468 --> 01:24:52,787
Put it back!

872
01:24:54,261 --> 01:24:56,125
We touch nothing!

873
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:07,697
- What about that?
- The chalices.

874
01:25:09,557 --> 01:25:12,597
- Oi! Why do you get to look first?
- Fine, then.

875
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:33,413
- Together.
- Together.

876
01:25:36,515 --> 01:25:37,538
Rocks.

877
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:39,915
The Spanish.

878
01:25:40,413 --> 01:25:42,010
They're ahead of us, mate.

879
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:46,113
I shall have a look at that map.
If it's what I fear...

880
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:58,424
I wonder why they left this behind.

881
01:26:02,591 --> 01:26:05,173
Don't touch the map.

882
01:26:10,866 --> 01:26:11,866
They know the path,

883
01:26:12,323 --> 01:26:15,974
but I can also see where
they'll most likely make camp.

884
01:26:29,505 --> 01:26:30,575
Jack!

885
01:26:33,868 --> 01:26:37,496
Gibbs... I was just on me way
to break you out of jail.

886
01:26:39,902 --> 01:26:41,643
You stole my map.

887
01:26:42,147 --> 01:26:44,405
Right. Best be started.

888
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:48,920
Ole.

889
01:27:06,502 --> 01:27:08,047
Mermaids.

890
01:27:10,844 --> 01:27:13,601
Careful, these pools run deep.

891
01:27:13,925 --> 01:27:17,206
If she escapes, all is lost.
Quartermaster.

892
01:27:19,265 --> 01:27:22,489
Look. Look!

893
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:27,357
Staked out to die,
to dry in the sun.

894
01:27:27,566 --> 01:27:30,609
Only half in the water.
Not enough to live,

895
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:35,088
but just... enough
to make the dying slow.

896
01:27:36,255 --> 01:27:37,204
Think on it.

897
01:27:37,304 --> 01:27:40,517
Your people, murdered,
harvested for their tears.

898
01:27:41,203 --> 01:27:45,262
Syrena... won't you cry?

899
01:27:46,271 --> 01:27:47,695
All die, even you.

900
01:27:47,869 --> 01:27:51,282
- Soon, I hear.
- Listen...

901
01:27:53,891 --> 01:27:55,282
Listen.

902
01:27:55,652 --> 01:27:58,664
Can you not hear
your sisters scream?

903
01:27:59,388 --> 01:28:01,389
Do you not hear them?

904
01:28:02,516 --> 01:28:05,204
We need but one tear.

905
01:28:08,263 --> 01:28:09,263
Vile creature!

906
01:28:09,432 --> 01:28:11,969
- Chop off her fingers, one by one!
- Choke her!

907
01:28:12,143 --> 01:28:14,402
Cut out the tears
from behind the eyes!

908
01:28:15,206 --> 01:28:16,622
Where's your voice in this?

909
01:28:17,445 --> 01:28:20,098
Maybe she'll have a change of heart
when the sun rises.

910
01:28:20,574 --> 01:28:24,144
Oh, aye. She will burn,
but I cannot wait for the sun.

911
01:28:24,322 --> 01:28:25,982
Perhaps we should build a fire.

912
01:28:26,156 --> 01:28:28,272
- No.
- Do not contest me, cleric.

913
01:28:28,632 --> 01:28:31,487
- You will not torture her.
- We need only one tear.

914
01:28:31,662 --> 01:28:34,779
I will tear every scale
from her body one by one if I see fit.

915
01:28:34,957 --> 01:28:36,493
If that displeases you, go pray.

916
01:28:36,667 --> 01:28:39,750
I was wrong. Not every soul
can be saved. Yours cannot.

917
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,753
Behold, gentlemen,
a man formerly of faith.

918
01:28:42,923 --> 01:28:45,790
That vile creature, as you call her,
is worth a hundred of you.

919
01:28:45,968 --> 01:28:47,674
Oh, you care for her?

920
01:28:50,387 --> 01:28:52,155
You fancy her.

921
01:28:53,567 --> 01:28:56,568
And do not deny
what is clear to my eyes.

922
01:28:58,264 --> 01:28:59,406
Question is...

923
01:29:02,532 --> 01:29:04,542
does she fancy you?

924
01:29:06,996 --> 01:29:10,468
By... God, she does.
We are in luck!

925
01:29:12,061 --> 01:29:13,559
Bring forth a tear...

926
01:29:15,126 --> 01:29:17,455
or witness
the death of this poor soul.

927
01:29:19,758 --> 01:29:23,098
Syrena...
if you could manage a tear,

928
01:29:23,402 --> 01:29:24,745
I would be grateful.

929
01:29:26,389 --> 01:29:27,672
Sadness, yes,

930
01:29:28,443 --> 01:29:33,513
- but no sorrow... yet.
- Not by your hand, father!

931
01:29:33,613 --> 01:29:36,285
Time and tide wait for none.
Quartermaster.

932
01:29:49,171 --> 01:29:51,872
Ooh, aye, mermaids are tough.

933
01:29:52,497 --> 01:29:53,831
The lot of them.

934
01:29:54,344 --> 01:29:58,462
Tie her up like the others.
And... get rid of this.

935
01:30:03,426 --> 01:30:05,690
- You are confident?
- Yes.

936
01:30:06,638 --> 01:30:09,248
I am a woman. So is she.

937
01:30:17,523 --> 01:30:20,567
What's your play, Jack?
Throwin' in with Barbossa.

938
01:30:21,616 --> 01:30:22,820
There is a girl...

939
01:30:23,576 --> 01:30:26,714
a female... of the opposite sex.

940
01:30:26,814 --> 01:30:30,667
- When is there not?
- Perhaps I should say "damsel".

941
01:30:30,910 --> 01:30:33,688
You're rescuin' a damsel?
Well, there's a first.

942
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:37,074
Yes, but it's just that
I may have caused said damsel

943
01:30:37,244 --> 01:30:40,336
- some manner of harm many moons ago.
- Out with it.

944
01:30:41,136 --> 01:30:44,563
Gibbs... this is the woman from Seville.

945
01:30:44,742 --> 01:30:48,286
Ahh, you... pretended to love 'er,
then you left 'er and broke her heart.

946
01:30:48,464 --> 01:30:52,982
Worse. I may have had,
briefly, mind you...

947
01:30:55,604 --> 01:30:58,231
- stirrings.
- Stirrings?

948
01:30:58,855 --> 01:31:02,443
- Stirrings.
- What? Like... feelings, you mean?

949
01:31:02,652 --> 01:31:05,544
No, no, no. Not quite all the way
to feelings. More like...

950
01:31:10,091 --> 01:31:11,952
All right, feelings, damn you.

951
01:31:12,057 --> 01:31:15,942
And you left her still.
Oh, that's low.

952
01:31:18,024 --> 01:31:19,104
Thank you.

953
01:31:26,467 --> 01:31:27,450
Stealth over force.

954
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:30,890
I'll take it from here
on account of your... condition.

955
01:31:32,539 --> 01:31:34,487
You don't have termites,
do you?

956
01:31:34,875 --> 01:31:36,340
I appreciate your concern, Jack,

957
01:31:36,511 --> 01:31:39,196
but I'll be keepin'
you company all the same.

958
01:31:39,296 --> 01:31:42,289
Hold here, lieutenant commander.
Wait for my signal.

959
01:32:14,473 --> 01:32:16,703
There. That one.
That be the leader.

960
01:32:16,993 --> 01:32:19,101
Make note of his tent
because that's where...

961
01:32:20,644 --> 01:32:24,232
No, wait. By God...
that must be them right there.

962
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,741
Your sword smells funny.

963
01:32:30,948 --> 01:32:35,777
Aye. Poison from the
innards of poisonous toads.

964
01:32:35,877 --> 01:32:38,920
Just a scratch,
you're a dead man in minutes.

965
01:32:39,133 --> 01:32:41,209
Would you mind
pointing it the other way?

966
01:32:41,518 --> 01:32:43,135
I don't like toads.

967
01:32:48,186 --> 01:32:51,412
- What are you doing?
- Plannin' an escape route.

968
01:32:51,813 --> 01:32:55,387
- Isn't that how you do it?
- Yes.

969
01:32:56,138 --> 01:32:59,069
Or sometimes I just... improvise.

970
01:33:26,169 --> 01:33:27,395
Now what?

971
01:33:28,513 --> 01:33:32,609
We stroll out, slow and steady.
Just like we belong.

972
01:34:32,653 --> 01:34:36,672
- I'm sorry, Syrena.
- Philip, you're alive.

973
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:40,510
- Yes.
- You came for me.

974
01:34:42,874 --> 01:34:44,046
Why?

975
01:34:46,454 --> 01:34:49,008
You're different... are you not?

976
01:34:51,147 --> 01:34:54,589
Do you know not of kindness...
compassion?

977
01:35:12,522 --> 01:35:14,457
Tears of sorrow, never.

978
01:35:14,557 --> 01:35:16,885
Mermaids be too tough for that.

979
01:35:17,277 --> 01:35:18,902
But tears of joy...

980
01:35:20,864 --> 01:35:23,164
They say these be
the more potent anyway.

981
01:35:23,370 --> 01:35:25,825
Syrena, on my word,
I had no part in this.

982
01:35:27,705 --> 01:35:29,060
Let 'her go.
You don't need 'er now.

983
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:31,938
Let her go? No.

984
01:35:32,356 --> 01:35:35,253
Secure her bonds.
We leave her with her own.

985
01:35:44,977 --> 01:35:49,788
- How's that escape route working?
- Here's your chance to improvise.

986
01:35:50,145 --> 01:35:51,521
I'm attempting it.

987
01:35:51,811 --> 01:35:54,355
I might be able
to get a... hand loose.

988
01:35:54,589 --> 01:35:57,001
Oh, you got a knife.
That's very good.

989
01:35:57,997 --> 01:35:59,216
Better.

990
01:36:04,843 --> 01:36:06,366
I want one of those.

991
01:36:10,969 --> 01:36:14,774
Here's to revenge.
Sweet and clear.

992
01:36:15,376 --> 01:36:18,895
- Revenge?
- Come, come, Hector.

993
01:36:19,756 --> 01:36:23,394
If you wanted the chalices,
you'd seen they were missing and gone.

994
01:36:24,096 --> 01:36:27,472
You were lying in wait,
for Blackbeard.

995
01:36:28,388 --> 01:36:32,268
- Oh...
- King George, privateer... wig...

996
01:36:33,827 --> 01:36:34,922
Cheap theatrical facade.

997
01:36:35,097 --> 01:36:38,359
- I'm not buying it.
- You weren't there that night.

998
01:36:38,534 --> 01:36:42,157
- When the Pearl was lost?
- Taken, not lost.

999
01:36:44,547 --> 01:36:48,322
We were off the coast of Hispaniola
when we came under attack.

1000
01:36:48,893 --> 01:36:52,413
No provocation nor warning
nor offer of parley.

1001
01:36:52,664 --> 01:36:54,998
We were peppered with cannon fire.

1002
01:36:56,334 --> 01:36:59,797
And then the sea beneath
the Pearl began to roil.

1003
01:37:00,998 --> 01:37:03,713
The Pearl was pitchin'
and yawin' violently.

1004
01:37:04,383 --> 01:37:05,383
Every plank, every rail,

1005
01:37:05,544 --> 01:37:08,148
every spar, all at once,
began to creak.

1006
01:37:08,730 --> 01:37:10,847
The riggin' had come to life.

1007
01:37:11,764 --> 01:37:14,323
Our own ship turned against us...

1008
01:37:14,683 --> 01:37:17,603
tanglin' the crew,
wrappin' around 'em like snakes.

1009
01:37:18,104 --> 01:37:19,961
And wrappin' around me leg.

1010
01:37:20,701 --> 01:37:23,213
But me arms were free
and me sword was to hand.

1011
01:37:23,536 --> 01:37:26,166
I am the master of me ship,
not Blackbeard.

1012
01:37:27,046 --> 01:37:30,493
I am the master of my fate,
not Blackbeard.

1013
01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:33,494
So I did what needed done.

1014
01:37:40,869 --> 01:37:42,796
I survived.

1015
01:37:44,255 --> 01:37:48,326
So... you're not
after the Fountain.

1016
01:37:48,858 --> 01:37:51,912
I care not for King George
or tavern yarns

1017
01:37:52,090 --> 01:37:54,559
that give hope for a healed limb.

1018
01:37:56,143 --> 01:38:00,114
But I'd give me left arm
for a chance at Blackbeard.

1019
01:38:00,361 --> 01:38:02,756
- Not your right?
- I need me good arm

1020
01:38:02,934 --> 01:38:08,196
to drive my poisoned blade
through his... heart.

1021
01:38:08,864 --> 01:38:10,948
I'll see
you get the chance, mate.

1022
01:39:30,112 --> 01:39:31,403
The prisoner's escaping.

1023
01:39:38,636 --> 01:39:41,023
He's escaping!
Fan out! Find him!

1024
01:39:41,198 --> 01:39:42,278
Go! Go!

1025
01:39:44,461 --> 01:39:47,384
Hold your fire!
I want him alive!

1026
01:39:55,680 --> 01:39:57,435
I figured that was the signal.

1027
01:40:40,771 --> 01:40:43,964
- Go! Prepare to move out!
- The enemy is soon upon us.

1028
01:40:46,142 --> 01:40:48,784
I'm sorry about the chalices, Jack,
but I've an appointment to keep.

1029
01:40:48,884 --> 01:40:51,440
- I'll not be goin' back.
- No need.

1030
01:40:52,405 --> 01:40:55,215
- Shall we have a drink?
- We'll drink at the Fountain.

1031
01:41:14,146 --> 01:41:17,423
How is it we can never meet
without you pointing something at me?

1032
01:41:18,084 --> 01:41:22,525
- You brought the chalices, Sparrow?
- Aye. Oi!

1033
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:29,363
- I see you brought a friend.
- I did.

1034
01:41:29,684 --> 01:41:32,062
And the one-legged man,
he is near.

1035
01:41:32,453 --> 01:41:34,130
- Aye?
- Aye.

1036
01:41:35,359 --> 01:41:36,335
Now...

1037
01:41:36,435 --> 01:41:39,086
Before I go just handing them over,
I do have one or two conditions.

1038
01:41:39,188 --> 01:41:41,372
- Name them.
- Firstly,

1039
01:41:41,656 --> 01:41:44,167
I'll be having me compass back.
No, no, that's secondly.

1040
01:41:44,457 --> 01:41:48,266
Firstly, upon your word,
you will bring no harm to Angelica.

1041
01:41:48,406 --> 01:41:51,037
I'll make no vows
to the likes of you, Sparrow.

1042
01:41:51,630 --> 01:41:56,652
But it costs me nothing to admit
that she was never in harm's way.

1043
01:41:57,257 --> 01:42:01,282
Secondly, then, priorly firstly...
I will be having me compass back.

1044
01:42:02,050 --> 01:42:04,195
Please? I do deserve it.

1045
01:42:04,295 --> 01:42:07,505
Do you have any idea how difficult
it was to catch that filthy pig?

1046
01:42:07,863 --> 01:42:10,372
Not the... big one,
the four-legged one.

1047
01:42:13,473 --> 01:42:17,568
Thank you.
And thirdly... Mr. Beard,

1048
01:42:18,155 --> 01:42:20,054
there are times, not very often,

1049
01:42:20,486 --> 01:42:23,710
when I do reflect
upon my heinous misdeeds.

1050
01:42:24,008 --> 01:42:27,725
Chief among them, I note
how poorly I have treated Mr. Gibbs,

1051
01:42:27,903 --> 01:42:30,519
- my loyal first mate.
- Aye! Now you bring it up...

1052
01:42:30,697 --> 01:42:33,359
Left him to rot in jail, I did.
Didn't care.

1053
01:42:33,533 --> 01:42:38,376
Still don't. But, point being,
you must let him go free.

1054
01:42:40,130 --> 01:42:43,425
- Is that it?
- I think so.

1055
01:42:43,773 --> 01:42:46,204
Quick, or the pig runs,
and good luck getting those chalices.

1056
01:42:46,304 --> 01:42:48,079
Jack, if it's all the same to you,
I'd be just as...

1057
01:42:48,179 --> 01:42:49,179
Done.

1058
01:42:49,493 --> 01:42:50,892
Release the swine.

1059
01:42:56,862 --> 01:42:59,698
Perhaps, if you don't mind,
I could tag along with you folk for a...

1060
01:43:02,570 --> 01:43:04,604
This will lead you to freedom, mate.

1061
01:43:11,465 --> 01:43:14,358
I could have swore
it was somewhere right around here.

1062
01:44:44,568 --> 01:44:46,172
We must not stop.

1063
01:45:03,274 --> 01:45:05,830
A-ha!... Dead end.

1064
01:45:06,486 --> 01:45:08,528
Dead... end.

1065
01:45:09,277 --> 01:45:10,343
Dead end.

1066
01:45:11,904 --> 01:45:14,824
Jack, I'm starting to think
you don't know where you're going.

1067
01:45:15,503 --> 01:45:18,382
It is not the destination
so much as the journey, they say.

1068
01:45:19,712 --> 01:45:21,204
Chalices, if you please.

1069
01:45:33,096 --> 01:45:34,529
Stand back.

1070
01:45:57,043 --> 01:45:58,080
Jack...

1071
01:45:58,577 --> 01:46:00,150
have you ever, in fact...

1072
01:46:00,751 --> 01:46:05,860
seen, with your own eyes...
the Fountain of Youth?

1073
01:46:06,527 --> 01:46:08,598
I'm sorry, could you
repeat the question?

1074
01:46:08,749 --> 01:46:10,215
Quartermaster...

1075
01:46:10,988 --> 01:46:12,011
No, no!

1076
01:46:15,681 --> 01:46:17,662
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait.

1077
01:46:21,183 --> 01:46:24,955
"Aqua... de Vida."

1078
01:47:04,934 --> 01:47:06,065
Master Scrum...

1079
01:47:07,588 --> 01:47:09,917
- Do you mind?
- Squire?

1080
01:48:09,210 --> 01:48:11,039
So beautiful.

1081
01:48:50,579 --> 01:48:54,146
Sparrow, I'll be the first
to taste those waters.

1082
01:48:57,590 --> 01:48:58,818
Father!

1083
01:49:02,467 --> 01:49:04,176
The one-legged man.

1084
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:10,780
- You brought him here.
- Would I do that?

1085
01:49:11,563 --> 01:49:13,319
Edward Teach!

1086
01:49:14,024 --> 01:49:16,642
For crimes committed
on the high seas,

1087
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:21,010
by the authority granted me
by His Majesty the King...

1088
01:49:21,192 --> 01:49:24,121
and with a goodly amount
of personal satisfaction...

1089
01:49:24,551 --> 01:49:27,309
I hereby place you
in the custody of the court,

1090
01:49:27,703 --> 01:49:31,164
and declare you to be my prisoner.

1091
01:49:32,245 --> 01:49:35,355
My trick's out, is that it?

1092
01:49:35,917 --> 01:49:40,378
Such crimes do include, but are not
limited to, piracy, treason,

1093
01:49:41,005 --> 01:49:44,307
murder, torture of
the most heinous sort,

1094
01:49:44,652 --> 01:49:48,656
includin' the brutal theft of one used,
twisted, hairy right leg.

1095
01:49:49,271 --> 01:49:56,927
- You... dare face this sword?
- This far away from your ship? Aye.

1096
01:49:57,027 --> 01:50:01,356
Aye. That be the cold breath
of fate I feel down my nape.

1097
01:50:01,575 --> 01:50:07,056
But... I'll have one last fight,
by God.

1098
01:50:07,369 --> 01:50:08,744
Kill 'em all!

1099
01:50:09,881 --> 01:50:12,309
Hey, whoa! Hang on a minute.

1100
01:50:13,168 --> 01:50:16,058
I just... I just need
to understand something.

1101
01:50:16,703 --> 01:50:20,168
Right. So... you will fight against them,

1102
01:50:20,427 --> 01:50:21,471
they will fight against you.

1103
01:50:21,571 --> 01:50:24,471
All on account of him
wanting to kill him?

1104
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:29,261
Where is the sense?
Exactly.

1105
01:50:29,571 --> 01:50:33,401
I say, let them fight each other...
while we lay back,

1106
01:50:33,501 --> 01:50:36,871
watch, have a drink,
place some wagers! Eh?

1107
01:50:38,273 --> 01:50:39,500
Aye.

1108
01:50:42,292 --> 01:50:43,789
- Kill 'em!
- No quarter!

1109
01:51:14,304 --> 01:51:15,497
Get off me!

1110
01:51:48,708 --> 01:51:49,892
Scrum, the chalices!

1111
01:51:51,847 --> 01:51:53,319
And the tear! Follow!

1112
01:51:56,983 --> 01:51:57,994
Fight!

1113
01:51:59,275 --> 01:52:02,893
Hand it over. The tear.
There's a good lad.

1114
01:52:03,192 --> 01:52:05,145
I'm more afraid of her
than I am of you.

1115
01:52:10,667 --> 01:52:13,086
Hand it over.
There's a good lad.

1116
01:52:16,450 --> 01:52:19,900
- The chalices, if you please.
- Sorry, Jack.

1117
01:52:20,168 --> 01:52:24,663
I told you. I need years.
And now, yours will do.

1118
01:52:32,529 --> 01:52:33,717
Scrum!

1119
01:52:55,467 --> 01:52:56,532
Syrena...

1120
01:53:00,742 --> 01:53:03,063
Oh, God... You will not... take her.

1121
01:53:03,619 --> 01:53:08,171
If you have taken her,
you will give her... back.

1122
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:09,672
Give her back...

1123
01:53:11,185 --> 01:53:13,965
Give her back, please.
Please.

1124
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:40,325
I expected fate
to put up more of a fight, eh?

1125
01:53:57,196 --> 01:54:00,929
I will not have that smile
on your face as I strike you down.

1126
01:54:02,371 --> 01:54:05,349
Take a gander, Edward Teach.

1127
01:54:35,973 --> 01:54:39,250
This land is hereby forever
claimed in the glorious name

1128
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:42,065
of His Majesty, King George...

1129
01:54:48,229 --> 01:54:51,099
Someone make a note
of that man's bravery.

1130
01:54:58,318 --> 01:55:01,864
Senorita, the chalices... por favor.

1131
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:24,383
Only God can grant eternal life,
not this pagan water.

1132
01:55:35,524 --> 01:55:38,796
Men! Destroy this profane temple!

1133
01:55:41,620 --> 01:55:43,031
The Fountain!

1134
01:55:57,289 --> 01:55:58,635
You are a fool.

1135
01:55:58,839 --> 01:56:01,611
You seek in this place
what only faith can provide.

1136
01:56:01,843 --> 01:56:04,456
Faith? In faith,
there is light enough to see

1137
01:56:04,556 --> 01:56:07,049
but darkness enough to blind.

1138
01:56:10,477 --> 01:56:12,349
What devilry is this?

1139
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:19,503
- For the Pearl.
- What have you done?

1140
01:56:22,988 --> 01:56:25,570
Angelica! Don't! It's poison!

1141
01:56:29,909 --> 01:56:32,277
I'm not such the fool
to take on Blackbeard

1142
01:56:32,377 --> 01:56:35,467
without a little... venomous advantage.

1143
01:56:37,098 --> 01:56:38,285
Jack!

1144
01:56:50,427 --> 01:56:52,648
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew,

1145
01:56:52,936 --> 01:56:56,349
and this sword,
payment for my missing limb!

1146
01:57:10,534 --> 01:57:12,284
- Hang on!
- Pull!

1147
01:57:57,387 --> 01:57:59,630
Do not waste my tear.

1148
01:58:29,068 --> 01:58:31,088
Drink this.
This one has the tear.

1149
01:58:31,296 --> 01:58:33,099
- You must drink the other.
- No!

1150
01:58:34,072 --> 01:58:37,327
I cannot save you both.
One of you must sacrifice.

1151
01:58:38,367 --> 01:58:41,512
You take it, father...
for your soul.

1152
01:58:43,245 --> 01:58:48,460
Captain Teach, she's dying.
You must save your daughter.

1153
01:58:50,006 --> 01:58:52,014
This one takes life?

1154
01:58:52,907 --> 01:58:54,770
This one has the tear
and gives life?

1155
01:58:54,870 --> 01:58:56,272
Aye, hurry!

1156
01:59:05,122 --> 01:59:09,372
Angelica...
Save me, my child.

1157
01:59:11,251 --> 01:59:12,251
No.

1158
01:59:21,382 --> 01:59:22,911
I love you, father.

1159
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:36,948
Wait a minute...

1160
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:42,601
In fact, it might have been
the other way around.

1161
01:59:43,493 --> 01:59:46,953
This cup had the tear,
that one had the... other bit.

1162
01:59:47,434 --> 01:59:48,559
Trickster!

1163
01:59:48,707 --> 01:59:50,437
- Devil!
- Father!

1164
01:59:57,375 --> 01:59:59,254
You, bastard! How could you?

1165
01:59:59,911 --> 02:00:04,589
Your father saved you.
Perhaps his soul is now redeemed, eh?

1166
02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:06,442
You are hurt.

1167
02:01:09,282 --> 02:01:10,599
In body only.

1168
02:01:12,678 --> 02:01:17,195
My mind is at peace...
because of you.

1169
02:01:18,119 --> 02:01:20,887
- Me?
- Yes.

1170
02:01:21,997 --> 02:01:23,570
I was lost.

1171
02:01:25,533 --> 02:01:29,016
The wind... the tides...

1172
02:01:30,254 --> 02:01:32,303
they ought to renew a man's faith.

1173
02:01:34,761 --> 02:01:36,881
But for me, only you.

1174
02:01:38,096 --> 02:01:44,118
Philip, I can save you.
You need only ask.

1175
02:01:46,179 --> 02:01:50,473
- I seek but one thing.
- What is that?

1176
02:01:51,807 --> 02:01:53,312
Forgiveness.

1177
02:01:54,244 --> 02:01:56,746
If not for me, you would
never have been captured.

1178
02:01:57,771 --> 02:01:59,166
Ask.

1179
02:02:01,398 --> 02:02:02,742
Forgive me.

1180
02:02:28,311 --> 02:02:31,816
- I hate you.
- The bloke who saved your life?...

1181
02:02:32,098 --> 02:02:35,452
The years I possess,
stolen from my own father!

1182
02:02:35,576 --> 02:02:38,571
I only helped Blackbeard do
what any father should have done.

1183
02:02:39,262 --> 02:02:42,123
You are cruel... and ignorant.

1184
02:02:45,905 --> 02:02:48,677
One pistol... one shot.

1185
02:02:49,989 --> 02:02:53,086
- To kill myself before I starve?
- There's no trusting you, love.

1186
02:02:53,319 --> 02:02:55,731
Besides, this is
a well-travelled trade route.

1187
02:02:56,206 --> 02:02:57,663
You can signal a passing ship.

1188
02:02:57,964 --> 02:03:01,244
Or, you can just bite
the proverbial bullet, as it were.

1189
02:03:01,344 --> 02:03:03,558
And how will I get free
of these bonds?

1190
02:03:03,921 --> 02:03:05,761
You broke free of your bonds
half an hour ago,

1191
02:03:05,873 --> 02:03:08,518
waiting for the precise moment
to pounce.

1192
02:03:11,634 --> 02:03:12,954
Admit it, Jack.

1193
02:03:13,358 --> 02:03:17,171
- You still love me.
- If you had a sister and a dog,

1194
02:03:17,744 --> 02:03:19,742
I'd choose the dog.

1195
02:03:20,524 --> 02:03:23,392
Treasure!
There is a chest with jewels!

1196
02:03:23,492 --> 02:03:25,904
Jewels with the power
to rule the wind and tide!

1197
02:03:26,004 --> 02:03:28,038
- You're making that up!
- Wait...

1198
02:03:30,119 --> 02:03:33,595
I am with child. Yours.

1199
02:03:34,585 --> 02:03:35,916
I don't recall that we ever had...

1200
02:03:36,016 --> 02:03:38,693
- You were drunk!
- I've actually never been that drunk.

1201
02:03:39,163 --> 02:03:40,246
Wait!

1202
02:03:42,126 --> 02:03:44,127
There is something
I want to say to you.

1203
02:03:44,800 --> 02:03:48,505
Something I wanted to say
from the moment we first met.

1204
02:03:49,388 --> 02:03:50,592
Go on, then.

1205
02:03:53,053 --> 02:03:54,262
I love you.

1206
02:03:57,906 --> 02:03:59,157
As do I.

1207
02:03:59,722 --> 02:04:03,184
Always have. Always will.

1208
02:04:07,671 --> 02:04:10,445
- I gotta go.
- Jack!

1209
02:04:12,676 --> 02:04:14,266
This is not over!

1210
02:04:15,324 --> 02:04:16,540
Jack!

1211
02:04:26,088 --> 02:04:27,462
Missed!

1212
02:04:42,943 --> 02:04:45,826
The Revenge is mine.

1213
02:04:52,470 --> 02:04:53,487
Sir...

1214
02:04:56,511 --> 02:04:58,034
We found this below decks.

1215
02:05:24,812 --> 02:05:26,778
All hands!
Ply to windward!

1216
02:05:26,999 --> 02:05:29,954
Get crackin',
ye bloomin' cockroaches!

1217
02:05:32,852 --> 02:05:35,434
The Crown served me well.

1218
02:05:35,991 --> 02:05:38,745
But now,
by the gods of sea and sky...

1219
02:05:39,044 --> 02:05:42,811
make way for Tortuga!

1220
02:05:54,546 --> 02:05:57,154
Gibbs, you filthy, besotted shellback,
you made it!

1221
02:05:57,423 --> 02:05:58,423
Aye!

1222
02:05:59,056 --> 02:06:00,451
And I trust we managed a profit

1223
02:06:00,629 --> 02:06:04,946
- from our joint enterprise?
- Feast your eyes.

1224
02:06:10,229 --> 02:06:12,446
The compass led me straight and true.

1225
02:06:12,649 --> 02:06:14,832
What of Blackbeard's men
guarding the ship?

1226
02:06:14,932 --> 02:06:18,560
I employed the selfsame maneuver
we perfected in New Guinea.

1227
02:06:18,950 --> 02:06:22,769
Seemed a shame to leave
an entire fleet behind.

1228
02:06:23,209 --> 02:06:24,763
Shame indeed.

1229
02:06:37,132 --> 02:06:38,287
I hate that monkey.

1230
02:06:38,724 --> 02:06:41,398
So, the Pearl....
Any idea how to get 'er out?

1231
02:06:42,227 --> 02:06:45,049
We shall need a crossbow,
an hourglass, three goats...

1232
02:06:45,473 --> 02:06:48,633
One of us must learn to play the trumpet
whilst the other one goes like this...

1233
02:06:48,822 --> 02:06:52,042
- I know a man with a goat.
- Good. I can go like this...

1234
02:06:54,856 --> 02:06:56,316
Jack, I have to ask...

1235
02:06:56,607 --> 02:06:59,406
You had the chalices,
the water, the tear...

1236
02:06:59,620 --> 02:07:02,164
You could 'ave lived...
maybe forever.

1237
02:07:02,282 --> 02:07:04,200
The Fountain does test you, Gibbs.

1238
02:07:04,300 --> 02:07:07,307
But better to not know
which moment may be your last.

1239
02:07:07,663 --> 02:07:12,226
Every morsel of your entire being
alive to the infinite mystery of it all.

1240
02:07:12,811 --> 02:07:15,107
And who's to say
I won't live forever, eh?

1241
02:07:15,752 --> 02:07:18,322
Discoverer...
of the Fountain of Youth.

1242
02:07:19,315 --> 02:07:21,172
I have no say in it, Gibbs.

1243
02:07:21,928 --> 02:07:23,967
It's a pirate's life for me.

1244
02:07:25,017 --> 02:07:26,265
Savvy?
