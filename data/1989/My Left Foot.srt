1
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,717
I'll bring you back a slice of cake.

2
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,095
Get away from the window.

3
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:31,879
Now don't forget.
Mr Punch, you will call me, won't you?

4
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,811
This way, please.

5
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,521
No, no, I'll take them.

6
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,857
Look, Ma, it's gorgeous.

7
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:56,111
Well, you're very welcome, Christy,
very welcome.

8
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,489
To your humble abode.

9
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,867
Oh, my humble abode.
Yes, well, I suppose so.

10
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,753
Hello. My name is Mary.

11
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,922
I'll be with you till you go on this evening.

12
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,633
I have to take him into the library.

13
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:26,225
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.

14
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,396
Be careful of that fella.

15
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,147
I'll be okay.

16
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,734
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

17
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:57,047
Now, you're all very welcome
to my humble abode,

18
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:03,220
and to this benefit,
organised by my friend Dr Eileen Cole,

19
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,306
Dr Eileen Cole.

20
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:13,981
<i>Now I'm not going to ask you to put
your hands in your pockets, not yet,</i>

21
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:19,278
<i>because we're going to start the evening
with a little concert.</i>

22
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,821
Do you want to go out and watch?

23
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,366
No.

24
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,881
Do you want to see the original?

25
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,550
The original?

26
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,552
Of the book.

27
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,706
It looks good.

28
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,834
Looks can be deceivin'.

29
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,129
It's a bit sentimental.

30
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,760
Did you paint this?

31
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,762
Yes.

32
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,848
That's very good.

33
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,198
Mr Brown?

34
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:31,326
Your son was born a couple of hours ago.

35
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,704
There's been some complications.

36
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,171
Where's the small one?

37
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,423
A pint and a small one?

38
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:48,010
- That's what I said.
- So long as you're payin' for it.

39
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,608
Are you gonna put him in a home, Paddy?

40
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:06,361
He'll go in a coffin before
any son of mine will go in a home.

41
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:13,452
Paddy... I believe it's the end of the road
for you in the breedin' stakes.

42
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,080
Who told you that?

43
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:22,420
Now... What are you goin' to do?

44
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,082
Are you goin' to tie a knot in it?

45
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,720
Now, Paddy, there was no need for that.

46
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,934
A shut mouth catches no flies.

47
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,823
Where's Tom?

48
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,368
Is Tom not up yet?

49
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:03,001
It's all right! I'm up! I'm up ages!

50
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,597
Say goodbye to Christy, Father.

51
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,933
Goodbye, Christy.

52
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,978
Be a good girl. See you later.

53
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,399
See you, Christy.

54
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,069
- See you, Christy.
- Bye, Christy.

55
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,878
Something for the money box, Christy.

56
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,021
Another pound saved, Christy.

57
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,367
Here, Christy.

58
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,838
Good boy, that's it.

59
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,764
I have to go away, Christy.

60
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,058
To hospital.

61
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:45,437
Don't worry, Sheila's going
to look after you while I'm gone.

62
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,192
Do you understand, Christy?

63
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:07,417
That's my Ma. That's my Da.

64
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,463
I was their baby.

65
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,885
It's only for a few days, Christy.

66
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,974
I'd better get this house organised
before I go.

67
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:28,647
You can't be stickin' to me
like stickin' plaster forever, Christy.

68
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,051
Nearly there, Christy.

69
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,166
Christy, I have to go and make a phone call.
Stay there.

70
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,382
Oh, my God... Nan...

71
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,594
Nan! Nan!

72
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:17,566
I heard this terrible bangin' and rushed over.

73
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:21,152
She was carryin' Christy down the stairs
when she fell.

74
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:26,992
And there he was,
lyin' at the bottom of the stairs like a moron.

75
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:30,537
God help her.
He's a terrible cross to the poor woman.

76
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,623
Sure he has the mind of a three-year-old.

77
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,587
A is for apples.

78
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,131
B is for butter.

79
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,387
C is for carrot.

80
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:56,187
And D... is for dunce.

81
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,109
Poor, unfortunate gobshite.

82
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:09,367
Enough to feed an army.
God, you'll never go hungry, Christy.

83
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:25,300
Would you like to come back with me
till your mammy comes home?

84
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,691
What's 25% of a quarter?

85
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,071
25% of a quarter?

86
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,293
Now that's a stupid question.

87
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,914
I mean, 25% is a quarter.

88
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,583
You can't have a quarter of a quarter.

89
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,461
You can. Can't you, Christy?

90
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:04,589
What would he know?

91
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:23,149
Ma! Ma, Christy picked up the chalk.

92
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,953
Go on, Christy. Go on, make your mark.

93
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,583
It's a Y.

94
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,678
It's an X.

95
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:01,271
- What's that, Christy?
- That's only an auld squiggle.

96
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,080
There's something in that.

97
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:22,417
Nah, don't be gettin' notions
into your head, woman.

98
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,586
The child's a cripple. Face facts.

99
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,882
It won't do anybody any good
trying to put ideas in his head.

100
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,686
- Oh, that's great.
- We're gonna put the engine on now.

101
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,023
- You're puttin' an engine in it?
- Yeah. Come on.

102
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:55,241
Come on, engine.
All he needs now is a license.

103
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,160
It's great!

104
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,376
Take it easy, will ya?
Go on, take it easy.

105
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:09,047
He'll play in that all day now.

106
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,466
He can go out with the other boys now.

107
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,887
- Look at those!
- They're massive!

108
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,683
- What's that?
- That's her thing.

109
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:26,106
You put your thing in there
for a half an hour and you get a baby.

110
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:29,359
If you do it for an hour you get twins.

111
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,903
My cousin's a twin.

112
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,323
- Benny! Brian! Come on!
- There's your Ma.

113
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,950
Quick, Tom. Here's Ma!

114
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,536
- It's not my magazine!
- Is Benny in there?

115
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:40,787
- Hide it!
- Where?

116
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,790
- Just hide it!
- Are you deaf? Come in for your tea!

117
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,251
- Hide it under Christy!
- Are you all deaf?

118
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,963
I've been calling you for 20 minutes
to come in for your tea. Come on, Christy.

119
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,674
- It's okay, Mam, we'll take him.
- Well, take him in now.

120
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,052
It's been on the table
for at least a half an hour.

121
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,404
See?

122
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,045
Why won't he go to bed?

123
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,841
He loves that auld chariot.

124
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:40,430
Come on, get him up.
I want to go and have a pint.

125
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:44,434
Come on, Christy.
It's way past your bedtime.

126
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,478
It's nearly closin' time.

127
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,830
Now, son, you know
you can never get out of Hell.

128
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,790
You can get out of Purgatory

129
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,710
but you can never get out of Hell.

130
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,422
Do you know that?

131
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,636
Do you?

132
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,724
Mrs Brown...

133
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:32,148
I don't think you should bring him
to the altar just yet.

134
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:36,236
You've been very helpful, Father.

135
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:07,892
Christy, do you know all
about All Souls' Night?

136
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,270
Did I ever tell you about that?

137
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,939
It's a very special night,
you know, because...

138
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,275
every time that you light a candle
on All Souls' Night,

139
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,819
you have to say five Our Fathers

140
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,613
and five Hail Marys and five Glory Bes,

141
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:25,702
and then a soul flies up out
of the flames of Purgatory

142
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,746
and goes straight up to Heaven.

143
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,166
Say some prayers for the poor souls in Purgatory.

144
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,262
Right.

145
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,976
What's wrong with you?

146
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:52,186
Christy, keep your voice down.

147
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,063
What's wrong with you, son?

148
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,232
What's the matter with you?

149
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,359
What do you want?

150
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,820
Do you want to light another candle?
Is that it?

151
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:04,407
Do you? For the poor souls?

152
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,785
Good boy. That's a good boy.

153
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:11,789
And don't forget, Christy,
if we can't understand you, God can.

154
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,685
See, Christy?

155
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:35,271
Even God has to lock his house.

156
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,873
Look, Christy! There it is! Look!

157
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,375
See, that's your soul going up to Heaven!

158
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:58,878
Oh, look! Look, Christy. Oh, look.

159
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:04,092
- You frightened the life out of him.
- Here, Christy.

160
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,260
You're king of the bonfire.

161
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:13,684
Don't be frightened, Christy.
It's only your brother- Tom.

162
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:17,271
This way, Christy. This way.

163
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,371
Get him over here!

164
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:01,274
You all right, Christy?

165
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:05,361
What's Christy doing, Sheila?
Is he all right?

166
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,322
He's drawing.

167
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,119
He's drawing a triangle.

168
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,291
No, Christy, you don't start there.

169
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,588
Here, son.

170
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:34,474
Now, that's a triangle.

171
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,520
That's not a triangle.

172
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:41,898
That's an A.

173
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,324
- What's up?
- Keep quiet.

174
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,159
All I said was, "What's up?"

175
00:24:53,242 --> 00:24:54,410
Sit down!

176
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,169
Here, Paddy.

177
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,087
Why don't you go and have a pint?

178
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,797
- What?
- Here.

179
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:09,258
- What's that?
- It's money.

180
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,760
Where'd you get it?

181
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:14,847
From the fairies.
Go and have a drink, Paddy.

182
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:17,934
I don't need a drink!
All I need is to be obeyed in me own house!

183
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,062
Mother.

184
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:05,041
Sweet Jesus.

185
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:11,964
Jesus suffering Christ.

186
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:18,179
He's a Brown!

187
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,431
He's a Brown, all right!

188
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,392
Christy's a Brown!

189
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,227
Out!

190
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:26,771
Where you goin', Paddy?

191
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:30,816
Where do you think?
This man deserves a jar!

192
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,997
This is Christy Brown!

193
00:27:45,956 --> 00:27:48,668
My son. Genius.

194
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,386
Hello.

195
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,846
Is he okay?

196
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,891
- He's grand.
- Good.

197
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,060
It's just that he can be a bit...

198
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,938
What?

199
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,483
A bit like Christy.

200
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:18,572
He's fine. He's asleep now.

201
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,533
Well...

202
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,327
I'll leave you alone, then.

203
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,051
14...

204
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,762
15, 16...

205
00:28:41,946 --> 00:28:45,933
- Keep your voice down.
- 17. Great.

206
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,694
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

207
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,614
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

208
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:05,411
<i>Happy birthday, dear Christy</i>

209
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:10,082
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

210
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,961
Go on, go on.

211
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,756
- Go on now, me boy.
- He's a man now, Father.

212
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,215
Come on, Christy. 17 candles.

213
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:19,717
Now take a deep breath. Come on.

214
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:24,180
Will you shut that baby up,
for Christ's sake?

215
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:28,017
- Take it easy, Christy.
- Go on. Make a wish.

216
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,061
- Come on, Christy.
- Go on, Christy.

217
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,901
Go on, Christy!

218
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,030
Go on, Christy.

219
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,823
Go on!

220
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:46,202
It's like the bleedin' fire of Hell,
that one is.

221
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,204
Here you go, Christy, here.

222
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,499
There, now. Go.

223
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:54,376
That's it. Well done.

224
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,213
Don't worry, you'll get your wheelchair, Christy.

225
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,258
Get it! Go!

226
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:03,677
Get the fuckin' ball!

227
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:12,186
Save it, Christy!

228
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,896
Well saved, Christy!

229
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,147
Good save!

230
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,235
He bit me!

231
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:24,198
He bit me!

232
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:27,576
It's a free out! A free out!

233
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,079
- We're taking it.
- Okay, come on.

234
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,998
Pass it, will ya?

235
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,209
Stay away from them sheets!

236
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,381
He handled it!

237
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:43,175
Penalty right here. Give us it.

238
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:44,927
Let Christy take it.

239
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,485
You can't hold him up.

240
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:02,903
Right!

241
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,924
He's got a left like a cannon!

242
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:48,240
If it stops at Tom, I'll kill you.

243
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,248
Nobody...

244
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:58,000
No, nobody.

245
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,712
It's pointin' at Christy.

246
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,589
He's not in the game.

247
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,466
He is if it's pointing at him.

248
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:10,220
I don't think it's pointing at me.

249
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,365
You're the nicest of the lot.

250
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:32,868
And you've nice eyes, too.

251
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,249
Come on, let's go.

252
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:41,877
Christy, you boy, you.
Chasin' the women.

253
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,088
See you, Tom.

254
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,547
See you, Rachel.

255
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,091
See you, Tom.

256
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,288
Not here, Brendan. Later.

257
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:37,016
This is a fine time of night
to be coming in.

258
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:40,728
- What's wrong, Ma?
- I don't like these late nights, Sheila.

259
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,059
What's this?

260
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,063
Holiday pay, isn't it?

261
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,485
I got laid off.

262
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:14,071
What about Christy's wheelchair?

263
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,158
Christy will get his wheelchair, okay?

264
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:23,413
Why did you get laid off?

265
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:28,335
Don't you question me
in front of the children.

266
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,008
A brick hit the foreman in the head
accidentally on purpose.

267
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,437
It's Rachel.

268
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,068
- How are ya?
- What?

269
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,663
"Your beautiful eyes are splendid pools of blue...

270
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,498
"in whose depths I swim regularly."

271
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:07,791
It's lovely, isn't it?

272
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:10,586
He even signed it himself.

273
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:24,057
Even signed it himself. "C.B."

274
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:27,561
That's not Tom Brown. That's Christy.

275
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,439
Surely he does it with his left foot!

276
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,903
You're in love with a cripple!
She's in love with a cripple!

277
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:39,072
Rachel, come back!

278
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:47,331
Anyone not abed?!

279
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:50,209
Can I speak to Christy Brown, please?

280
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,755
Christy! You're wanted.

281
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:09,937
Did you paint that?

282
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,438
Yeah.

283
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:14,399
I can't take it.

284
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:18,403
Sorry.

285
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,039
Tell your brother Tom
we were asking for him.

286
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,270
What's this?

287
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:53,063
What does it look like?

288
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,693
But we had porridge for breakfast.

289
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:01,822
So?

290
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:05,575
And we had it for dinner.

291
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:09,746
So?

292
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,258
I'm not eating any more.

293
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:26,305
You get that into you.

294
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:29,891
I can't.

295
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,605
Get it into you.

296
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,124
Go on, more.

297
00:38:55,631 --> 00:38:58,211
Who's been eating my porridge?

298
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:01,882
What did you say?

299
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:07,637
What did he say, missus?

300
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:09,890
He just said the porridge is lovely.

301
00:39:14,574 --> 00:39:16,521
Burst his brain, the barbarian.

302
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:21,777
Keep quiet!

303
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,861
Come on, Christy.
Everybody has to go to bed.

304
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,948
I have to do my painting.

305
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:10,033
I know you have to do your painting

306
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:12,828
but everybody has to go to bed
because there's no coal.

307
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,872
Don't push me nerves any further, all right?

308
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,793
I'm sorry.

309
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,882
Christy, someday you'll have
a place of your own.

310
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:32,305
All right, come on, you lot.

311
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:34,307
Mind my paintings.

312
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,161
Are all those kids in bed?

313
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,688
What's up, Christy?

314
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,899
Coal.

315
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,902
- What?
- Coal!

316
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:28,437
Coal?

317
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:32,282
It's too early.

318
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,326
Coal!

319
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,453
All right, all right!

320
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:45,462
Mister! Mister!

321
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:49,257
Me driver abandoned me.
Can you push me?

322
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,887
Come back, you bastard!

323
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:11,112
Your plan's not working, Christy.

324
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:12,864
Wait till he goes up the hill.

325
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:31,841
Hold the baby.

326
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:41,853
Come on, Christy!

327
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:49,067
We'll be warm for the whole winter, Christy!

328
00:42:56,866 --> 00:43:00,161
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!
What's happened to you?

329
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:03,373
It's all right, Ma. It's only coal.

330
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:06,084
I know where you got that coal.

331
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,962
You know it's a sin to steal.

332
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:12,215
And you know that God is looking down
on you right now.

333
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:16,261
And that coal is not coming into this house.

334
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,728
Come in here and sit by the fire, woman.

335
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:35,655
You want me to wash you, Christy?

336
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:37,907
No.

337
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:43,371
- Good night, Christy.
- Don't you be late!

338
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:59,971
Ma! There's something wrong with Christy!

339
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:01,973
There's something wrong with him.

340
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:05,435
What's wrong with you, Christy?
What's wrong?

341
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,689
Fire!

342
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:12,942
Fire!

343
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,862
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

344
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,454
Ma, what are you trying to do?

345
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:25,622
Get water, quick!

346
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:27,999
Hurry up!

347
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,128
What's wrong with you? Are you mad?

348
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:04,536
What have you got in the box, woman?

349
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,996
Christy's money.

350
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:11,543
- What?
- Money for Christy's wheelchair.

351
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:24,264
Must be twenty pounds in there.

352
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:27,058
28 pounds, 7 and threepence.

353
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:34,315
We've been sitting here in the freezing cold,
eating porridge for breakfast, dinner, and tea,

354
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:37,861
and you have 28 pounds, 7 and threepence
up the fucking chimney.

355
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:01,593
Tom, Brian.

356
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,595
Everybody, upstairs.

357
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,889
Now!

358
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:15,565
- Ma, what's wrong?
- You, too, Christy.

359
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:36,878
Your daughter's getting married.

360
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:48,473
Well, that's wonderful news.

361
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,645
- When?
- Friday.

362
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:57,398
What's the rush?

363
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:02,362
She's pregnant.

364
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:03,905
That's great news.

365
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:11,162
I mean, that's wonderful.
That's just what we need.

366
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:15,333
Who's the father? Or do you know?

367
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,336
Leave me alone.

368
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,546
It's not my fault.

369
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:22,048
Then whose fault is it, then?
Is it mine?!

370
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:26,678
Oh, that's a lovely picture.
The old woman that lives in the shoe

371
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:28,888
and the daughter that couldn't keep
her knickers on!

372
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:31,933
Stop it. Stop it!

373
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:36,813
- You dirty, sleazy bitch!
- Stop it, Father!

374
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:43,695
- Get out of here, Sheila.
- She should be thrown out!

375
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,989
Her and her swollen belly! Fornication!

376
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:47,448
Get away from me!

377
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,785
That'll keep your legs shut for you!

378
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:52,745
Paddy, leave her!

379
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:55,123
When I get hold of you...

380
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:58,626
I'll break every bone
in your fucking body!

381
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:03,089
- Fucking kill him.
- Christy, stop.

382
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:06,217
Jesus Christ!
What am I gonna do in this fucking house?

383
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:07,887
Tom, Benny, stop him.

384
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:12,140
Stop, Christy! Stop him!

385
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:13,558
Christy, stop!

386
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:15,768
Christy, please stop!

387
00:48:15,852 --> 00:48:18,980
Christy, stop! Christy, please stop!

388
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,820
Christy, please! Christy, stop!
Stop it, Christy! Come on!

389
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,199
Christy, stop.

390
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:40,126
Christy. It's all right, Christy.

391
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,295
He's gone now, Christy.

392
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:46,174
Christy, come on.

393
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:49,719
Christy, it's all right.

394
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:55,391
Christy, I'm going away.

395
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,730
I'll miss you, too.

396
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:07,320
Look after me Ma for me.

397
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:39,894
I need a light.

398
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:41,646
What?

399
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,272
I need a light.

400
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:45,608
I don't smoke.

401
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:47,235
I need a light!

402
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:50,405
I'm not deaf. I can hear you.

403
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,658
You need a light.
I haven't got any matches,

404
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:57,286
so you'll have to wait here
while I go and get one.

405
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:06,713
Don't you think I'm your mother
just because I'm looking after you for the evening.

406
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:09,966
I don't need a fucking psychology lesson.

407
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,968
I just need a fucking light.

408
00:50:27,734 --> 00:50:29,068
Light.

409
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:31,529
Have you got a cigarette?

410
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:34,574
I'm just after telling you I don't smoke.

411
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:37,702
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

412
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:55,344
Glass.

413
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,308
No point in drinking out of the bottle.

414
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,458
Hello. Dr Cole, please.

415
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:28,711
Hello, Eileen.

416
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,423
Yes. Yeah.

417
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:34,509
Athetoid cerebral palsy.

418
00:51:36,344 --> 00:51:38,930
- He's 19?
- Yes, 19.

419
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:42,058
Yes, 19.

420
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,935
Yes. That's correct.

421
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,814
I'll get his address.

422
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:50,441
Okay. Okay.

423
00:51:53,486 --> 00:52:00,284
Dr Cole thinks that this model
would be the best for your son.

424
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:03,496
- Which one?
- This one.

425
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:06,833
That is grand.

426
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:09,418
Yeah.

427
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:12,255
See, that there, he won a prize for that.

428
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:16,843
- That's lovely.
- His best one's here. Wait till I show you now.

429
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:20,763
- What's that?
- Nothing. See that one? Isn't that lovely?

430
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:24,308
And that one- torn, but you get the idea.

431
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:27,937
That's his first one
he ever did there. See?

432
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,068
- Watch your step there.
- I'm fine.

433
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:38,364
Christy, there's someone to see you.

434
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,953
This is Dr Cole.

435
00:52:47,874 --> 00:52:49,125
Hello, Christy.

436
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:55,006
You're a great painter.

437
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:56,299
No.

438
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:05,600
Look, I'm a doctor, like your mother says,
and I specialise in cerebral palsy.

439
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:10,980
We've just started a clinic- here in Dublin
and I wonder, would you like to attend it?

440
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:19,280
No, we don't have to pay, Christy.

441
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,077
Well?

442
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:30,499
Hope deferred maketh the heart sick.

443
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:34,545
- He said, "Hope deferred..."
- "Maketh the heart sick."

444
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:39,258
I understood that.

445
00:53:42,178 --> 00:53:43,247
Come on.

446
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,766
Maybe.

447
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,852
Good.

448
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:59,070
- Come on in!
- Please!

449
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:02,865
- No!
- You have to.

450
00:54:02,949 --> 00:54:05,117
What do you want them to do,
tow you behind?

451
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:07,954
Do you want to ride up front
with the driver?

452
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:10,539
Come on, Christy.
Come up in the front with me.

453
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:12,500
I'm all right.

454
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:13,960
He said he's all right.

455
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:16,063
Eileen.

456
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:20,901
Eileen, come here.

457
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:26,240
Easy. Come on. Relax.

458
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:29,535
- What?
- I want to go home.

459
00:55:29,618 --> 00:55:31,996
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

460
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:39,253
The door's been locked
for a few days now.

461
00:55:39,337 --> 00:55:41,964
I've got to try.

462
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:48,220
Christy.

463
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:50,473
Go away.

464
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:54,977
Christy, there's somebody here to see you.

465
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:03,861
Christy?

466
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:09,909
I'm not a child.

467
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:11,702
Not a child, he says.

468
00:56:11,786 --> 00:56:13,788
There's too many children at the clinic.

469
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:21,087
Christy, if you like,
we can work here.

470
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:23,589
Fuck off.

471
00:56:26,092 --> 00:56:31,389
With speech therapy, I could teach you
how to say "fuck off" more clearly.

472
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,832
One, two...

473
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:00,584
three, four, five.

474
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:02,586
And over again.

475
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,922
One, two...

476
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,966
Just relax with it. Relax.

477
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:10,678
Three, four, five. That's it.

478
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:14,890
One, two, three, and out.

479
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:21,981
Breathe.

480
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,527
Nope. Your lungs are too weak.
Leave it be.

481
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,613
That's right. Try this instead.

482
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:35,828
Right. Now you have a go.

483
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:37,830
Yes. Blow.

484
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:42,126
Steady, steady.

485
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:44,211
And one big breath.

486
00:57:46,005 --> 00:57:49,383
That's very good.

487
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,469
Now focus the breath.

488
00:57:55,306 --> 00:57:57,808
Breathe slowly and...

489
00:57:57,892 --> 00:57:59,894
He's been like that for three days now.

490
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:03,105
I don't know what's wrong.
He won't talk to me.

491
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:06,525
Go on up and see him.

492
00:58:14,742 --> 00:58:17,244
I've brought you a present.

493
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:23,751
Thanks.

494
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:29,924
There's a speech in there
I'd love you to have a look at.

495
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:32,718
It's "To be or not to be." Hamlet.

496
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:38,307
I wish you'd stop feeling sorry for yourself.

497
00:58:41,477 --> 00:58:43,896
I don't want to be a failure, either.

498
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,859
Will you have a look at it for me?

499
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:52,821
Maybe.

500
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:22,935
"To be... or not... to be.

501
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:30,526
"To be... or not to be.

502
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:35,239
"That is the question.

503
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:39,034
"To be or not...

504
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:40,828
"To be...

505
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:44,999
"That is the question...

506
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:48,043
"Whether...

507
00:59:48,127 --> 00:59:52,214
"nobler in the mind to..."

508
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:56,719
"To be... or not to be."

509
00:59:56,802 --> 01:00:01,515
"To be or not to be...

510
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,768
"That is the question.

511
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:09,565
"Whether it is nobler in the mind..."

512
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:12,610
to have to fucking suffer listening to that.

513
01:00:15,613 --> 01:00:17,781
He's in love with this girl Eileen.

514
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:25,998
Well... so long as he's getting better.

515
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:28,709
He could get hurt, Paddy.

516
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:33,797
A broken body's nothing to a broken heart.

517
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,324
Yeah!

518
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:54,401
Eileen, how's it going?

519
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:56,111
Very, very well.

520
01:00:58,447 --> 01:00:59,948
I've got some news for you.

521
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:01,241
What?

522
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:03,911
Remember I told you
about Peter and his gallery?

523
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,412
Yeah.

524
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:10,793
Well, he's offered you
an exhibition of your own.

525
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:13,379
What do you think about that?

526
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,093
I think you're brilliant.

527
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:23,013
Yeah. I'm only as brilliant as my patients.

528
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:29,812
"Consummation...

529
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:32,439
"devoutly to be wished.

530
01:01:32,523 --> 01:01:34,566
"To die, to sleep..."

531
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:37,695
"To sleep...

532
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:40,030
"perchance to dream.

533
01:01:40,114 --> 01:01:42,533
"Aye, there's the rub.

534
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,703
"For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come."

535
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:47,538
Is that our Christy up there?

536
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:51,250
Does that sound like our Christy?

537
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,420
Sounds a lot better.

538
01:01:56,964 --> 01:01:58,757
Not to me, it doesn't.

539
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:01,677
Are you mad, woman?

540
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,471
You can understand your child
for the first time.

541
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:06,724
I always understood him.

542
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:08,559
Nobody else ever did.

543
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:12,896
At least he can function now.

544
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:16,483
There's something in that voice that...

545
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:18,527
that disturbs me.

546
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,530
What do you mean?

547
01:02:23,282 --> 01:02:25,743
Too much hope in it.

548
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:28,328
What?

549
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,415
There's too much hope in it.

550
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:38,881
"Fly to others that we know not of?

551
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:43,552
"Thus, conscience does make cowards of us all."

552
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:44,845
What was it?

553
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:48,182
- "And thus, the native hue..."
- "And thus, the native hue of resolution

554
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:51,977
"is sicklied over with the pale cast of thought

555
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,730
"and enterprises of great pitch and moment

556
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:59,151
"with this regard, their currents turn awry
and lose the name of action."

557
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,946
What do you think about Hamlet, Christy?

558
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:06,575
A cripple. He can't act.

559
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:09,328
He did in the end.

560
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:10,913
Too late.

561
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:18,462
Eileen...

562
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:22,466
I like you very much.

563
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:25,093
And I like you, Christy.

564
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,263
You have the heart of a poet.

565
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:30,808
No.

566
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:32,643
Oh, well.

567
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:35,896
What?

568
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:41,443
Nothing.

569
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:48,742
I better go.

570
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:59,336
Ladies and gentlemen?

571
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:01,340
Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you.

572
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:07,219
It gives me great pleasure
to open this exhibition...

573
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:09,721
of the work of Christy Brown.

574
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:13,517
A lot of people say that Christy
is a great crippled painter.

575
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:17,354
I think that's an insult to Christy.

576
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:18,605
That's right!

577
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:22,818
Christy is simply a great painter, full stop.

578
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:26,697
He has struggled with his material...

579
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:30,325
as every painter must do,
to bring it under control.

580
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:35,289
If you look around the walls today

581
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:38,083
you'll see the forces that shape Christy Brown.

582
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:42,004
His mother...

583
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:44,172
his father...

584
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:46,091
his brothers and sisters...

585
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:49,052
and the lady who brought him
to public recognition,

586
01:04:49,136 --> 01:04:50,345
Dr Eileen Cole.

587
01:04:50,429 --> 01:04:51,638
Yes!

588
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,613
So, what do you think?

589
01:05:07,696 --> 01:05:10,949
There are only two kinds of painting-

590
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:13,410
religious and the circus.

591
01:05:16,163 --> 01:05:18,206
Give me some wine.

592
01:05:22,461 --> 01:05:24,922
You know, on each side of the nose.

593
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:40,228
That's what it says here- "Seven-day Seascape".
Something like that.

594
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,612
There you go.

595
01:05:51,031 --> 01:05:52,532
And you've had enough to drink.

596
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:55,327
Don't have any more drink.
Do you hear me?

597
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:57,704
I'm going for a meal, Ma. You coming?

598
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:59,498
No, no, no. I'm...

599
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:02,042
I'll take your father home.
He's not feeling well.

600
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:06,004
There's no pints, you mean.
It's good wine, tell him.

601
01:06:06,088 --> 01:06:10,550
Your father never drank anything
but pints in his life. I'll take him home.

602
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:12,052
You getting a taxi?

603
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,888
- Eileen's giving us a lift.
- Right.

604
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:19,101
- I'll see you later, Ma.
- I'll see you later.

605
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:24,523
I think Mulcahy is a great painter.

606
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:27,359
In the... soul.

607
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:30,737
You see? I agree with Christy.

608
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:33,865
He's too uncontrolled for me.

609
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:39,830
Tim. Let Christy try the wine.

610
01:06:47,212 --> 01:06:53,010
<i>Introibo ad altare Dei.</i>

611
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:55,679
- What's he saying?
- The Latin mass.

612
01:06:57,389 --> 01:07:00,308
I thought that was James Joyce.

613
01:07:00,392 --> 01:07:01,727
The wine's A1.

614
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:06,148
- Can you tell us what year it is, Christy?
- I'm not that sophisticated.

615
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:07,816
Not yet.

616
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,714
I love you, Eileen.

617
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,674
And I love you, Christy.

618
01:07:32,758 --> 01:07:36,595
No. I really love you.

619
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:45,520
I love you all.

620
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:47,898
That's good.

621
01:07:47,981 --> 01:07:51,359
I even love... Peter.

622
01:07:56,573 --> 01:08:02,412
I'm glad you like Peter, Christy,
because we're going to get married in six months.

623
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:04,372
Christy, what do you think of that?

624
01:08:22,099 --> 01:08:23,767
Con...

625
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:30,232
Con...

626
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:48,667
Congratulations...

627
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,545
Peter and Eileen...

628
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:54,756
on the won...

629
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:59,386
wonderful news.

630
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:13,191
I'm glad you taught me how to speak...

631
01:09:13,275 --> 01:09:16,528
so I could say that, Eileen.

632
01:09:26,413 --> 01:09:29,749
Well... Where were we, then?

633
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:32,294
- Discussing Mulcahy.
- Mulcahy's empty.

634
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:34,045
I thought you said Mulcahy was full of soul.

635
01:09:34,129 --> 01:09:37,132
I said he was empty. Whiskey!

636
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:42,387
Take it easy, Christy.

637
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:49,603
You're not my mother.

638
01:09:50,896 --> 01:09:52,772
Never forget that.

639
01:10:11,166 --> 01:10:15,503
You know, I know what age that is.

640
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:19,382
That's ten-year-old...

641
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:24,012
same age as me.

642
01:10:24,095 --> 01:10:25,889
- Don't give him any more.
- Pour!

643
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:27,474
Take that whiskey from him, Tony.

644
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:30,894
Touch it, and I'll kick you...

645
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:38,360
in the only part of your anatomy
that's animated.

646
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:41,071
Stop it.

647
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:52,999
Why did you say you loved me?

648
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:54,626
Because I do love you.

649
01:10:55,309 --> 01:10:57,754
You mean platonic love.

650
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:04,803
I've had nothing but platonic love all me life.

651
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:07,138
Do you know what I say?

652
01:11:07,222 --> 01:11:09,307
Fuck Plato!

653
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:15,480
And fuck all love
that's not 100% commitment!

654
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:24,239
Pour!

655
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:31,371
- I can't let you go any further.
- Let's discuss nature.

656
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:34,165
Keep quiet, Christy.

657
01:11:34,249 --> 01:11:37,627
What are you going to do about it, Peter?

658
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:41,798
You're a nice man.
What are you going to do about it?

659
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:44,759
Peter, sit down.

660
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:47,262
- I'm going to wheel you out of this restaurant.
- Yeah?

661
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:52,392
Stop it!

662
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:56,896
- Wheel out the cripple! Wheel out the cripple!
- Stop! Just stop it.

663
01:11:56,980 --> 01:12:00,150
- Where's the fucking brake on this thing?
- Stop it!

664
01:12:01,735 --> 01:12:04,404
Stop it! Stop it, you bastard!

665
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:05,989
Stop it!

666
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:23,757
Sharon!

667
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,719
Sharon, come in for your tea.
Come on in for your tea, will you?

668
01:12:29,012 --> 01:12:32,807
Come in now for your tea, please. Come on.

669
01:12:32,891 --> 01:12:35,894
All right, Ma.

670
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:17,495
- Get up, Christy.
- I'm not well.

671
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:19,497
You've got a hangover, that's all.

672
01:14:19,581 --> 01:14:21,332
Leave me alone.

673
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:30,508
You get more like your father every day.

674
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:34,804
All hard on the outside
and putty on the inside.

675
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:38,850
It's in here...

676
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:41,269
battles are won.

677
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:43,688
Not in the pub...

678
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:46,941
pretending to be a big fella
in front of the lads.

679
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:54,949
Right. If you've given up, I haven't.

680
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:54,676
What do you think you're doing, Mum?

681
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:57,512
Building a room for you.

682
01:15:58,555 --> 01:15:59,764
Don't be mad.

683
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:02,934
Maybe if you have a room of your own...

684
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:05,478
you might start painting again.

685
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:16,823
You have me heartbroken, Christy Brown.

686
01:16:19,516 --> 01:16:22,161
Sometimes, I think you are me heart.

687
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:27,041
If I could give you my legs,
I would gladly take yours.

688
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:34,215
What's wrong with you, Christy?

689
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:39,596
I'm sorry, Mum.

690
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:59,073
What in the name of God is going on here?

691
01:16:59,157 --> 01:17:02,118
Christy and me's building a room.

692
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,454
- Youse are you building a room?
- Yep.

693
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:10,543
Will you have a look at this?

694
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:16,007
Christy, you may be a great painter

695
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:17,675
but you'll never be a brickie.

696
01:17:17,759 --> 01:17:20,178
Fair play to you, missus.

697
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:23,097
Right, lads.

698
01:17:23,181 --> 01:17:25,016
You bring in some more bricks.

699
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:28,019
Mix up a bit of muck.
Bring me in me level, will you?

700
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:31,356
Brown and Son Contractors are on the job.

701
01:17:33,358 --> 01:17:36,027
Here. You start over there.
I'll start over here

702
01:17:36,069 --> 01:17:37,528
and by the time you have
three courses up there

703
01:17:37,612 --> 01:17:39,614
I'll be finished here
and inside having me tea.

704
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:41,282
Not at all.

705
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:45,662
Water. More water.

706
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:48,790
I'm not beaten yet, bejesus.

707
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:53,086
My dad.

708
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:56,589
Brian, boys. Listen to me.
Let your father win.

709
01:17:56,673 --> 01:17:58,132
- What?
- He needs it.

710
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:00,452
Here.

711
01:18:01,135 --> 01:18:02,637
Take it easy, Father, will you?

712
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:05,090
Take it easy?

713
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:12,313
I was never able to take it easy
and you of all people ought to know that.

714
01:18:12,397 --> 01:18:13,448
Right, lads?

715
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,695
That's her finished.

716
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:23,950
They've a long way to go
to be a better man than their father.

717
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:28,538
Yeah.

718
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:37,922
Well, Christy, that's the nearest
he'll ever come

719
01:18:37,964 --> 01:18:39,632
to saying he loves you.

720
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,636
How are you?

721
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:48,057
Did you see the face on them?

722
01:18:48,141 --> 01:18:50,226
To see you pushing that cart.

723
01:18:50,309 --> 01:18:52,812
I'm parched now.
Do you want a cup of tea?

724
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,230
I'm going to make a nice cup of tea.

725
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:56,232
I'm going to have the cake here.

726
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:57,942
Oh, Christy.

727
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:03,072
- I'll just put the kettle on.
- All right, Ma.

728
01:19:06,826 --> 01:19:09,996
Come on. Who's in there?
These kids.

729
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:11,998
What's happening?

730
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:14,000
Come on, let me in.

731
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:16,919
What's going on?

732
01:19:17,003 --> 01:19:20,131
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Christy!
- What?

733
01:19:20,173 --> 01:19:22,842
Your father's on the floor
and I can't open the door.

734
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:25,261
Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Paddy!

735
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,346
Christy, I can't open the door.

736
01:19:34,854 --> 01:19:36,272
Get out of the way.

737
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:38,191
Christy, you can't open the door.

738
01:19:38,316 --> 01:19:40,443
Oh, Jesus. it doesn't open.

739
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:42,528
Christy, push!

740
01:19:50,785 --> 01:19:51,730
Jesus.

741
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:54,165
Paddy?

742
01:19:54,207 --> 01:19:56,125
Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Paddy.

743
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:06,302
Seven pounds, five shillings
and sixpence he owed, missus.

744
01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:15,895
<i>I was the best of them all</i>

745
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:20,483
<i>I was the best of them all</i>

746
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:24,153
Fair play to you, Christy.

747
01:20:24,237 --> 01:20:26,697
Drinks for everyone.

748
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:29,700
- Take it easy.
- That's my painting money.

749
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:33,204
I'm trying to get some drinks.
Get her a cider. Shut the old bitch up.

750
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:35,832
Fair play to you, Christy.
Your old fella will never be dead.

751
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:37,500
How's me Ma going to survive?

752
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:42,046
Don't be worrying about them.
They'll be all right.

753
01:20:44,382 --> 01:20:48,344
Terry, will you tell us about
when you and the old fella

754
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:51,681
carried the fireman up the ladder?
What happened there?

755
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:54,433
- Later.
- Yeah.

756
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:01,899
Give us a song, somebody.

757
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:04,610
Give us a song. Tom, give us a song.

758
01:21:04,694 --> 01:21:06,279
Christy.

759
01:21:06,404 --> 01:21:09,949
- Sing Daddy's favourite.
- Yeah.

760
01:21:13,411 --> 01:21:16,455
<i>As down the glen</i>

761
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:19,542
<i>One Easter morn</i>

762
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,962
<i>To a city fair</i>

763
01:21:23,045 --> 01:21:25,047
<i>Rode I</i>

764
01:21:25,131 --> 01:21:27,884
<i>There, armed lines</i>

765
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:30,636
<i>Of marching men</i>

766
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:32,471
<i>In squadrons...</i>

767
01:21:32,597 --> 01:21:34,640
Will somebody shut him up?

768
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:38,144
<i>No fife did hum</i>

769
01:21:38,269 --> 01:21:40,980
<i>Nor battle drum</i>

770
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:45,818
<i>Did sound its dread tattoo</i>

771
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:48,905
<i>And the Angelus bell...</i>

772
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:52,450
Hey. Keep it down a bit there, lads.

773
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:55,244
<i>...rang out in the foggy dew</i>

774
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,831
He was singing that for his father.

775
01:21:58,915 --> 01:22:00,291
His father was nothing but a mouth...

776
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:02,251
<i>High over Dublin</i>

777
01:22:02,335 --> 01:22:04,670
like all the Browns.

778
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:11,177
All right, lads... take it easy.

779
01:22:12,178 --> 01:22:13,763
Respect for Da.

780
01:22:24,023 --> 01:22:25,983
I don't fight cripples.

781
01:22:27,593 --> 01:22:28,696
Hold on.

782
01:22:33,658 --> 01:22:35,201
Wreck the pub!

783
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:48,881
Somebody get the till!
Get the till! Get the money!

784
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:51,217
Get the till!

785
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:00,726
Drinks are on the house!

786
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:15,908
That's great, Christy.

787
01:23:16,033 --> 01:23:18,577
No, it's not.

788
01:23:18,703 --> 01:23:20,746
Why not?

789
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:23,916
He's not there. I've no eye.

790
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,043
What?

791
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:27,586
I'm not a painter.

792
01:23:29,088 --> 01:23:31,549
I think it's brilliant.

793
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,676
It's the image of Da.

794
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:42,685
Poor Tom, what?

795
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,186
Yeah.

796
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:47,231
"All is nothing.

797
01:23:47,273 --> 01:23:50,359
"Therefore nothing must end."

798
01:23:51,444 --> 01:23:54,530
- What's all this, Christy?
- Nothing.

799
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:56,449
Sorry I asked.

800
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:06,083
Benny, would you help us?

801
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:07,960
Doing what?

802
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:09,795
Writing.

803
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:12,590
Yeah. Writing what?

804
01:24:13,591 --> 01:24:15,134
Me own story.

805
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:19,764
Yeah. Course I will.

806
01:24:22,808 --> 01:24:23,809
No.

807
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:26,979
Don't worry, Christy.
The book is great.

808
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:29,982
It's not bad.

809
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:33,152
Do you know what I was going to call it?

810
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:34,612
What?

811
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:36,822
The Reminiscences...

812
01:24:38,449 --> 01:24:40,159
Reminiscences?

813
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:43,662
Of A Mental Defective.

814
01:24:45,331 --> 01:24:47,291
That's a terrible title.

815
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:49,919
It was my blue period.

816
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:55,674
And you typed all of it
with your left foot?

817
01:24:56,801 --> 01:24:59,178
I didn't do it with me nose.

818
01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:03,432
I really wanted to finish it.

819
01:25:03,516 --> 01:25:05,851
You'll hear it later.

820
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:09,146
I have an appointment. I told you.

821
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:12,024
Is he good-looking?

822
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:14,652
- Who?
- Your appointment.

823
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:19,156
Yeah, in his own way he's nice.

824
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:26,372
It doesn't matter to me.
You can meet who you like.

825
01:25:26,497 --> 01:25:29,667
- Is he now?
- What?

826
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:31,502
Is he good-looking?

827
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:36,215
Yeah.

828
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:42,888
Are you in love with him?

829
01:25:50,688 --> 01:25:53,357
You're very bloody nosy, Christy Brown.

830
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,652
I was only asking.

831
01:26:01,574 --> 01:26:03,075
Would you like a drink?

832
01:26:03,159 --> 01:26:04,869
I'm working. I can't.

833
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:06,579
Later.

834
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:15,671
I have a date, I told you.

835
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:17,590
Yeah. I forgot.

836
01:26:23,429 --> 01:26:26,724
- You're a fast worker, aren't you?
- Read your book.

837
01:26:41,071 --> 01:26:43,532
I can't with you staring at me.

838
01:26:43,616 --> 01:26:45,534
So I'll look away.

839
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,706
Oh, God.

840
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:05,304
- She's very pretty, isn't she?
- Prettier than that bloody picture.

841
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:15,731
Just a minute.

842
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:18,150
Ma, are you in?

843
01:27:19,068 --> 01:27:20,778
All right. Go ahead.

844
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:35,417
Jesus! £800, Christy.

845
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:39,004
Are you finished?

846
01:27:39,088 --> 01:27:40,965
That was scrumptious, Ma.

847
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:43,300
Like you.

848
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:46,845
I fancy something sweet now.
What have you for dessert?

849
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:48,764
Ma, what have you for dessert?

850
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:50,099
Dessert?

851
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:55,104
Kids, do you not fancy
of drop of ice cream now?

852
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:58,857
- Ice cream, Ma.
- Get some ice cream.

853
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:04,029
Some raspberry ripple.
No, some Neapolitan.

854
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:08,951
- All right!
- The pink and green stuff.

855
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:11,036
But just this once, mind you now.

856
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:14,164
Won't see me spending money
on an ice cream.

857
01:28:25,134 --> 01:28:26,468
Jesus, what's this?

858
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:32,559
Here now, Ma!

859
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:36,061
What's this?

860
01:28:36,145 --> 01:28:37,563
It's Christy's money, Ma!

861
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:39,523
- Count it!
- Bring it here!

862
01:28:41,025 --> 01:28:42,901
£800.

863
01:28:45,738 --> 01:28:49,325
That's more money than your poor father
ever earned in a whole year.

864
01:28:51,577 --> 01:28:54,538
I can't take it.

865
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:58,250
It's for you. It's yours.

866
01:28:59,251 --> 01:29:02,379
I can't take it, son.

867
01:29:02,421 --> 01:29:05,507
Da was a bricklayer, Ma...

868
01:29:05,591 --> 01:29:07,718
and I'm a writer.

869
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,887
I know it's mad money.

870
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,724
I want you to have it.

871
01:29:16,518 --> 01:29:18,228
What would I do with it?

872
01:29:19,563 --> 01:29:26,403
To start, get yourself a dress
and a new pair of shoes.

873
01:29:26,445 --> 01:29:28,947
Will you?

874
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:42,294
Christy? You have a visitor.

875
01:29:48,634 --> 01:29:52,054
- You look well.
- So do you.

876
01:29:53,806 --> 01:29:55,057
Thank you.

877
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:57,059
Sit down.

878
01:30:03,816 --> 01:30:05,609
Look, I won't stay very long.

879
01:30:05,651 --> 01:30:08,112
Stay as long as you like.

880
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:12,491
I need to ask you a favour.

881
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:14,451
What?

882
01:30:15,661 --> 01:30:16,954
A benefit.

883
01:30:18,914 --> 01:30:20,165
Where?

884
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,000
Lord Castlewelland's.

885
01:30:22,126 --> 01:30:25,003
Him? He's mad.

886
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:29,800
Posh.

887
01:30:29,842 --> 01:30:32,010
Filthy rich.

888
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:38,851
I know you don't like appearing in public
but it's for a good cause.

889
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:42,855
- For the cripples.
- For the cripples.

890
01:30:42,938 --> 01:30:44,982
Yeah.

891
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:47,484
I'll try to behave myself.

892
01:30:49,111 --> 01:30:50,946
Sure it won't upset you too much?

893
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:53,782
So I'll anaesthetise myself.

894
01:30:53,866 --> 01:30:56,660
No! Not too much.

895
01:30:59,663 --> 01:31:01,373
How's Peter?

896
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:41,622
We have to get going, Christy.

897
01:31:41,747 --> 01:31:43,123
Yeah.

898
01:31:47,753 --> 01:31:51,632
What do you think?
Too much self-pity?

899
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:56,595
No. I think he's a lovely man
and not in the least sentimental.

900
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:59,765
Mary, do you really think so?

901
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:01,308
Yep.

902
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:05,103
And would you go out with him?

903
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:06,271
Certainly.

904
01:32:06,355 --> 01:32:08,607
Now listen, everyone...

905
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:10,859
So you'd go out with me?

906
01:32:12,152 --> 01:32:15,113
I might. He's talking about you.

907
01:32:15,197 --> 01:32:19,284
I want to introduce you to one of the brave...

908
01:32:19,326 --> 01:32:22,204
Well, no, quite the bravest chap
I've ever come across.

909
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:27,292
Yes, well, when Christy Brown was born,

910
01:32:27,376 --> 01:32:31,046
the doctors told his mother
that it was just no good...

911
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:35,968
- Stay with us for a couple of hours.
- a vegetable for the rest of his little life.

912
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:40,681
But Bridget Brown, she wouldn't take that.
Oh, no. She knew...

913
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:43,475
Would you go out with me tonight?

914
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:47,521
I told you, Christy.
I have an appointment.

915
01:32:47,646 --> 01:32:51,191
And so we have with us here tonight...

916
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:53,193
Are you in love with him?

917
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:56,738
Her faith in him and...

918
01:32:56,822 --> 01:32:58,323
Well?

919
01:32:59,866 --> 01:33:02,911
I asked you did you love him, Mary?

920
01:33:02,995 --> 01:33:07,249
Introduce to you Christy Brown,
a man of genius.

921
01:33:07,332 --> 01:33:08,542
Mary?

922
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:10,252
Christy.

923
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:12,754
Mary, I asked you a question.

924
01:33:14,172 --> 01:33:17,009
- Do you?
- That's none of your business.

925
01:33:17,843 --> 01:33:21,013
- So you won't answer me?
- Why should I?

926
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:24,099
- What are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid of anything.

927
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:27,185
You imagine that people are afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of you, okay?

928
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:29,688
You're afraid of yourself.

929
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:32,566
- Oh, come on. Look, just...
- You're afraid of me.

930
01:33:32,691 --> 01:33:34,568
I can't talk about this now. I'm going.

931
01:33:34,693 --> 01:33:37,195
Why can't we talk now?
Now's good enough for me.

932
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:41,199
- I'll see you again some time.
- "Again some time." I heard that before, Mary.

933
01:33:41,241 --> 01:33:43,535
Why is it always some fucking time?

934
01:33:43,619 --> 01:33:45,704
Mary, stay!

935
01:33:47,914 --> 01:33:49,875
Stay!

936
01:33:57,633 --> 01:33:59,384
Christy.

937
01:34:01,637 --> 01:34:03,555
We've got to go.

938
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:14,900
Right. Take me out to the firing squad so.

939
01:34:54,773 --> 01:34:58,695
I must say I'm really honoured to be asked
to give voice to the words of Christy Brown.

940
01:35:03,490 --> 01:35:08,995
"I was born in the Rotunda Hospital,
on June the 5th, 1932.

941
01:35:09,121 --> 01:35:12,958
"There were 22 children in all,

942
01:35:12,999 --> 01:35:16,962
"of which 13 survived.

943
01:35:19,631 --> 01:35:23,385
<i>"It would not be true to say
that I am no longer lonely.</i>

944
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:26,221
<i>"I have made myself articulate and understood</i>

945
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:28,223
<i>"to people in many parts of the world</i>

946
01:35:28,306 --> 01:35:31,643
<i>"and this is something we all wish to do,</i>

947
01:35:31,685 --> 01:35:33,645
<i>"whether we're crippled or not.</i>

948
01:35:34,688 --> 01:35:38,567
<i>"Yet, like everyone else,
I am acutely conscious sometimes</i>

949
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:40,819
<i>"of my own isolation,</i>

950
01:35:40,861 --> 01:35:43,405
"even in the midst of people.

951
01:35:44,197 --> 01:35:48,702
"And I often give up hope of ever being able
to really communicate with them."

952
01:35:48,827 --> 01:35:53,039
- "It is not only the sort of isolation..."
- What's the matter with Christy?

953
01:35:53,165 --> 01:35:56,209
"that every writer or artist
must experience in the creative mood

954
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:59,087
"if he is to create anything at all.

955
01:35:59,171 --> 01:36:03,675
"It is like a black cloud,
sweeping down on me unexpectedly,

956
01:36:03,759 --> 01:36:06,928
<i>"cutting me off from others.</i>

957
01:36:07,012 --> 01:36:09,514
<i>"A sort of deaf-muteness.</i>

958
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:16,354
"I lay back in my chair

959
01:36:16,438 --> 01:36:21,568
"while my own left foot
beat time to a new rhythm.

960
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:26,615
"Now I could relax
and enjoy myself completely.

961
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:30,368
"I was at peace. Happy."

962
01:36:44,716 --> 01:36:45,967
Thank you.

963
01:36:46,051 --> 01:36:48,386
Come on, Ma, stand up.

964
01:36:50,555 --> 01:36:54,893
Ma! Mother, come here.

965
01:36:55,811 --> 01:36:57,896
Christy, no, don't.

966
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:00,315
All right.

967
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:06,404
These are for you.

968
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,261
Give us one of them flowers, Ma.

969
01:37:46,111 --> 01:37:48,196
You're not coming with us in the car, Christy?

970
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:49,489
No.

971
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:51,700
You're mad, Christy. It's great.

972
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:55,662
Get in the car before I kick your arse.

973
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:57,956
Good luck, Christy.

974
01:38:06,715 --> 01:38:09,718
Good night, Christy.

975
01:38:09,801 --> 01:38:11,219
Good night, Ma.

976
01:38:17,183 --> 01:38:19,978
Go on. I'm all right.

977
01:38:21,897 --> 01:38:25,692
Will you get in the car now, Ma? I'm fine.

978
01:38:31,031 --> 01:38:34,326
Night, Christy. Be careful.

979
01:38:34,409 --> 01:38:36,494
You're not me Da, Tom.

980
01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:38,163
You take it easy, Christy.

981
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:40,498
Take it easy yourself!

982
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:42,167
Let's go.

983
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:48,381
Christy, tuck that under you.

984
01:38:49,007 --> 01:38:51,051
Great stuff.

985
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:55,931
I hope to see you again.

986
01:38:56,014 --> 01:38:59,601
Yes. I hope to see you again, Christy.

987
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:03,772
Before closing time.

988
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:47,899
- I thought I'd lost ya.
- Not at all.

989
01:39:47,941 --> 01:39:51,069
- You can just see Joyce's Tower down there.
- Oh, aye?

990
01:39:52,404 --> 01:39:56,950
And that's where JM Synge was born,
at the foot of the mountains.

991
01:39:58,827 --> 01:40:01,329
What'll we drink to?

992
01:40:03,248 --> 01:40:05,250
Let's drink to Dublin.

993
01:40:05,291 --> 01:40:07,669
To Dublin? Why?

994
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:11,089
Because Christy Brown was born there.
