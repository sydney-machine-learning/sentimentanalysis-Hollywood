62

...the words "Gotham City"
are synonymous with crime.

Harvey Dent...

the syndicate in this city.

down their doors...

He hung up. What have you got?

354
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,251
Here's the inner city.

355
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,455
VlCKl: Here's the sightings so far.

356
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:30,009
Maybe Batman has
some sort of flight pattern.

357
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,337
This is very good. Tonight we'll go
to dinner, then we'll walk the trail.

358
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,054
No can do. I got a date. Bruce Wayne.

359
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:39,298
Wayne! Wayne! Oh, no!

360
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:42,180
The guy's a stiff.
You could do much better.

361
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,650
Thanks for being so concerned. Bye.

366
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,571
[Voice echoes] Excuse me?

367
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:06,849
BRUCE: The soup. How is it?

368
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:09,531
VlCKl: It's great.

369
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:16,848
[Voice echoes] Could you pass the salt?

370
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,933
Sure.

373
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,094
BRUCE: Did you have trouble
finding the house?

374
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:39,569
No....

375
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,890
VlCKl: It was no problem.
BRUCE: Good.

376
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,892
Do you like eating in here?

377
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,777
Oh, yeah.

378
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,378
I don't think I've been in this room before.

379
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,928
[Vicki laughs]

380
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,613
You want to leave?

381
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,055
Yes.

382
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,048
ALFRED: There was young Master Bruce...

383
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:17,097
...leading his gray pony
with me on its back...

384
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:21,730
...like a sack of old potatoes, covered
in mud and nursing a sprained ankle.

385
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:26,614
ALFRED: That was the first and last time
I gave him a riding lesson.

386
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,617
I think I've embarrassed him
for long enough.

387
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,011
ALFRED: I'm off to bed.

388
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,049
ALFRED: Please, leave everything.
I'll tidy up in the morning.

389
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,607
ALFRED: Good night, miss.
VlCKl: Good night, Alfred.

390
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,577
-Good night, sir.
-Good night, Alfred.

391
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,576
VlCKl: He's really wonderful.
He loves you a lot.

392
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:53,494
Alfred's great. I couldn't find
my socks without him.

393
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,930
He reminds me of my grandfather.

394
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,698
Were you close to him?

395
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,778
I used to spend summers with
him and my grandmother.

396
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:07,330
They had a house on the lake.
Nothing like this, but...

397
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,413
...it was fun.

398
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,778
-That sounds nice.
-Yeah.

399
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,892
What about your family?

400
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:20,368
Actually, Alfred is my family.

401
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,053
This house and all this stuff
doesn't seem like you at all.

402
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:33,089
Some of it is very much me.

403
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,973
Some isn't.

404
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,219
That dining room is definitely not you.

405
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:42,097
The dining room isn't.

406
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,172

410
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,128

[Jack groaning and sobbing]

412
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,212
You understand that the nerves
were completely severed, Mr. Napier.

413
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:48,815
[Jack's sobbing turns into laughter]

414
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,053
You see what I have to work with here.

415
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:17,018
VlCKl: There are an awful lot of stairs
in this place.

416
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,010
My feet are killing me.

417
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:27,090
[Vicki giggles]

418
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,057
I feel a little drunk.
And you're not anything.

419
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,972
One drink and I'm flying.

420
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,010
Why are you afraid of flying?

421
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,132
That you, sugar bumps?

422
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:09,251
GRlSSOM: Who are you?

423
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:11,572
JACK: It's me.

424
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:13,652
"Sugar bumps."

425
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,088
You're alive! I heard you'd been--

426
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,489
JACK: Fried?

427
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:24,612
Is that what you heard?

428
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:27,090
You set me up over a woman.

429
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,733
A woman!

430
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,371
You must be insane.

431
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,813
JACK: Don't bother.

432
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:51,168
Your life won't be worth spit!

433
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:54,769
JACK: I've been dead once already.

434
00:35:55,179 --> 00:35:56,931
It's very liberating...

435
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,217
...if you think of it as...therapy.

436
00:36:02,139 --> 00:36:03,891
Jack, listen.

437
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,371
Maybe we can cut a deal.

438
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:10,695
Jack?

439
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:13,809
Jack is dead, my friend.

440
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:16,211
You can call me...

441
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:17,574
...Joker.
