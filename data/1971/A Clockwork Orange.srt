1
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:42,497
There was me.

2
00:01:42,897 --> 00:01:45,627
That is, Alex,
and my three droogs.

3
00:01:45,907 --> 00:01:49,536
That is, Pete, Georgie and Dim.

4
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:53,496
And we sat in the Korova Milk Bar,
trying to make up our rassoodocks...

5
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:56,006
what to do with the evening.

6
00:01:57,716 --> 00:02:00,806
The Korova Milk Bar sold milk plus.

7
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:04,715
Milk plus vellocet or
synthemesc or drencrom...

8
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,915
which is what we were drinking.

9
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:08,885
This would sharpen you up

10
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:13,055
and make you ready for a bit
of the old ultra-violence.

11
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:20,894
In Dublin's fair city

12
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:25,704
Where the girls are so pretty

13
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:29,834
I first set my eyes

14
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:34,503
On sweet Molly Malone

15
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:40,283
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow

16
00:02:40,553 --> 00:02:44,923
Through streets broad and narrow

17
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:49,633
Crying, "Cockles and mussels"

18
00:02:50,592 --> 00:02:52,692
One thing I could never stand

19
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:55,302
was to see a filthy,
dirty old drunkie

20
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:58,232
howling away at the
filthy songs of his fathers

21
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:00,802
and going "blerp blerp"
in between

22
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:05,301
as it might be a filthy old
orchestra in his stinking guts.

23
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:09,211
I could never stand to see anyone
like that, whatever his age.

24
00:03:09,411 --> 00:03:12,581
But more especially when he
was real old, like this one was.

25
00:03:20,221 --> 00:03:24,250
Can you spare some cutter,
me brothers?

26
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,490
Go on! Do me in, you bastard cowards!
I don't want to live anyway.

27
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,600
Not in a stinking world
like this.

28
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:41,509
And what's so stinking about it?

29
00:03:41,749 --> 00:03:46,009
It's a stinking world because
there's no law and order anymore!

30
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:49,339
It stinks because it lets
the young get onto the old

31
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:51,648
like you done!

32
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:56,758
It's no world
for an old man any longer.

33
00:03:57,328 --> 00:04:00,758
What kind of a world is it
at all?

34
00:04:00,998 --> 00:04:02,858
Men on the moon.

35
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:05,658
Men spinning around the earth.

36
00:04:05,868 --> 00:04:08,927
And there's not no
attention paid

37
00:04:09,137 --> 00:04:12,697
to earthly
law and order no more.

38
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:15,637
Oh, dear land

39
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,337
I fought for thee

40
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:57,374
It was at the derelict casino
that we came across Billy-boy

41
00:04:57,654 --> 00:04:59,674
and his four droogs.

42
00:05:00,014 --> 00:05:02,414
They were about to perform
a little of the old

43
00:05:02,724 --> 00:05:06,654
in-out, in-out on a weepy
young devotchka they had there.

44
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,640
Well, if it isn't fat, stinking

45
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,210
billy goat
Billy-boy in poison.

46
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,640
How are thou

47
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,749
thou globby bottle of cheap,
stinking chip-oil?

48
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:15,049
Come and get one in the yarbles

49
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:17,149
if you have any yarbles

50
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,419
you eunuch jelly, thou.

51
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:25,558
Let's get them, boys!

52
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:25,015
The police!

53
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:27,284
Come on. Let's go!

54
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:52,803
The Durango 95 purred away
real horror show.

55
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:57,242
A nice, warm vibratey feeling
all through your guttiwuts.

56
00:07:57,512 --> 00:08:00,682
Soon it was trees and dark,
my brothers

57
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:03,482
with real country dark.

58
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,519
We fillied around with other
travelers of the night

59
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,129
playing Hogs of the Road.

60
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,349
Then we headed west.

61
00:08:48,599 --> 00:08:52,299
What we were after now
was the old surprise visit.

62
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:53,759
That was a real kick

63
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:58,468
and good for laughs and
lashing of the old ultra-violent.

64
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:48,915
Who on earth could that be?

65
00:09:57,995 --> 00:09:59,584
I'll go and see.

66
00:10:10,374 --> 00:10:12,004
Yes, who is it?

67
00:10:12,274 --> 00:10:16,273
Excuse me, can you please help?
There's been a terrible accident!

68
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:21,613
My friend's bleeding to death!
Can I please use your telephone?

69
00:10:21,853 --> 00:10:25,153
We don't have a telephone.
You'll have to go somewhere else.

70
00:10:25,353 --> 00:10:28,053
But, missus, it's a matter
of life and death!

71
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:29,623
Who is it, dear?

72
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:32,452
A young man.
He says there's been an accident.

73
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:35,322
He wants to use the telephone.

74
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:38,802
I suppose you better let him in.

75
00:10:39,832 --> 00:10:41,702
Wait a minute, will you?

76
00:10:43,872 --> 00:10:47,141
I'm sorry, but we don't usually
let strangers in

77
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:01,080
What do you want from me?

78
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,660
Pete, check the rest
of the house. Dim

79
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,730
I'm singing in the rain

80
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,699
Just singing in the rain

81
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:20,369
What a glorious feeling

82
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:22,729
I'm happy again

83
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:25,939
I'm laughing at clouds

84
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:28,449
So dark up above

85
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,439
The sun's in my heart

86
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:34,718
And I'm ready for love

87
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:38,588
Let the stormy clouds chase

88
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,388
Everyone from the place

89
00:11:43,758 --> 00:11:45,058
Come on with the rain

90
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:48,127
I've a smile on my face

91
00:11:49,137 --> 00:11:51,197
I'll walk down the lane

92
00:11:52,207 --> 00:11:54,137
With a happy refrain

93
00:11:55,237 --> 00:11:57,107
And I'm singing

94
00:11:57,777 --> 00:11:59,207
Just singing

95
00:12:01,377 --> 00:12:02,536
in the rain

96
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:10,772
Viddy well, little brother.

97
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:12,672
Viddy well.

98
00:13:33,031 --> 00:13:36,860
We were all feeling a bit
shagged and fagged and fashed

99
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:41,700
it having been an evening
of some small energy expenditure.

100
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,910
So we got rid of the auto and
stopped at the Korova for a nightcap.

101
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,739
Hello, Lucy.

102
00:13:55,849 --> 00:13:57,549
Had a busy night?

103
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:01,659
We've been working hard too.

104
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:05,888
Pardon me, Luce.

105
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:17,058
There was some sophistos from
the TV studios around the corner

106
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:19,538
laughing and govoreeting.

107
00:14:19,878 --> 00:14:24,937
The devotchka smeched away, not
caring about the wicked world one bit.

108
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:29,177
Then the disk on the stereo
twanged off and out.

109
00:14:29,417 --> 00:14:32,717
And in the short silence
before the next one came on

110
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:36,116
she suddenly came
with a burst of singing.

111
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:42,296
And it was like, for a moment,
O my brothers

112
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:45,856
some great bird
had flown into the milk bar.

113
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:49,296
And I felt all the malenky
little hairs on my plott

114
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:51,435
standing endwise.

115
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:55,935
And the shivers crawling up
like slow, malenky lizards

116
00:14:56,205 --> 00:14:57,765
and then down again.

117
00:14:58,045 --> 00:15:00,735
Because I knew what she sang.

118
00:15:00,975 --> 00:15:04,385
It was a bit from
the glorious Ninth, by Ludwig van.

119
00:15:13,224 --> 00:15:15,314
What did you do that for?

120
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:17,614
For being a bastard
with no manners.

121
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:22,733
Without a dook of an idea about how
to comport yourself public-wise.

122
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:27,803
I don't like you should
do what you done.

123
00:15:28,273 --> 00:15:31,673
And I'm not your brother no more
and wouldn't want to be.

124
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,513
Watch that.

125
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:42,612
Do watch that, if to continue
to be on live thou dost wish.

126
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:45,852
Yarbles!

127
00:15:46,122 --> 00:15:48,822
Great, bouncy yarblockos to you!

128
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:52,951
I'll meet you with chain
or nozh or britva anytime.

129
00:15:53,261 --> 00:15:55,851
I'm not having you aiming
tolchocks at me reasonless.

130
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:59,201
It stands to reason,
I won't have it.

131
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:07,341
A nozh scrap anytime you say.

132
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,949
Doobidoob.

133
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:28,159
A bit tired maybe.

134
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:32,129
Best not to say more.

135
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:35,959
Bedways is rightways now.

136
00:16:36,469 --> 00:16:39,558
So best we go homeways
and get a bit of spatchka.

137
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:41,338
Right, right?

138
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:56,247
Where I lived was with
my dada and mum

139
00:16:56,517 --> 00:17:00,927
in municipal flat block
18-A, Linear North.

140
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:28,741
It had been a wonderful evening.

141
00:18:28,971 --> 00:18:32,461
And what I needed now
to give it the perfect ending

142
00:18:32,781 --> 00:18:35,681
was a bit
of the old Ludwig van.

143
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,127
Oh, bliss!

144
00:19:27,697 --> 00:19:29,787
Bliss and heaven!

145
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:34,857
It was gorgeousness and
gorgeosity made flesh.

146
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:39,727
It was like a bird
of rarest spun heaven metal.

147
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:43,406
Or like silvery wine
flowing in a spaceship

148
00:19:43,676 --> 00:19:46,476
gravity all nonsense now.

149
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:48,416
As I slooshied

150
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:51,706
I knew such lovely pictures.

151
00:20:11,205 --> 00:20:12,725
Alex. Alex!

152
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:21,404
What do you want?

153
00:20:21,614 --> 00:20:23,174
It's past eight, Alex.

154
00:20:23,444 --> 00:20:26,504
You don't want to be
late for school, son.

155
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:30,583
Bit of a pain in the gulliver, Mum.

156
00:20:30,883 --> 00:20:33,383
Leave us be,
and I'll try and sleep it off.

157
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:36,383
And then I'll be as right
as dodgers for this after.

158
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:40,423
But you've not been
to school all week, son.

159
00:20:40,693 --> 00:20:41,853
Got to rest, Mum.

160
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:44,232
Got to get fit.

161
00:20:44,632 --> 00:20:48,122
Otherwise, I'm liable
to miss a lot more school.

162
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:53,532
I'll put your breakfast in the oven.
I've got to be off meself now.

163
00:20:54,612 --> 00:20:58,812
All right, Mum.
Have a nice day at the factory.

164
00:21:03,151 --> 00:21:06,281
He's not feeling too good
again this morning, Dad.

165
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:08,391
Yes. Yes, I heard.

166
00:21:08,821 --> 00:21:10,311
You know what time he got in?

167
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:13,581
No, I don't.
I'd taken me sleepers.

168
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,750
I wonder

169
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,160
where exactly is it
he goes to work of evenings.

170
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,770
Like he says

171
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,340
it's mostly odd things he does.

172
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,770
Helping-like

173
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:32,669
here and there, as it might be.

174
00:22:14,317 --> 00:22:16,306
Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Deltoid.

175
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:18,486
Funny surprise, seeing you here.

176
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:22,656
Alex-boy!
Awake at last, yes?

177
00:22:23,296 --> 00:22:26,316
I met your mother
on the way to work, yes?

178
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:28,556
She gave me the key.

179
00:22:31,365 --> 00:22:33,635
She said something about
a pain somewhere.

180
00:22:33,865 --> 00:22:36,805
Hence, not at school, yes?

181
00:22:37,135 --> 00:22:40,305
A rather intolerable pain
in the head, brother sir.

182
00:22:40,545 --> 00:22:42,665
It should be clear
by this after-lunch.

183
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:46,135
Or certainly by this evening, yes.

184
00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:49,644
The evening's the great time,
isn't it, Alex-boy?

185
00:22:49,854 --> 00:22:53,374
- Cup of the old chai, sir?
- No time, no time.

186
00:22:53,684 --> 00:22:55,214
Sit, sit, sit!

187
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:59,584
To what do I owe
this extreme pleasure, sir?

188
00:23:00,324 --> 00:23:01,484
Anything wrong, sir?

189
00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:05,563
Wrong? Why should you
think of anything being wrong?

190
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,233
Have you been doing
something you shouldn't?

191
00:23:08,433 --> 00:23:09,733
Just a manner of speech.

192
00:23:10,003 --> 00:23:13,033
Yes, well, it's just a manner
of speech from your

193
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:16,573
post-corrective advisor to you
that you watch out, little Alex.

194
00:23:16,773 --> 00:23:20,332
Because next time it's not
going to be the corrective school.

195
00:23:20,582 --> 00:23:24,912
Next time it'll be the Barley place,
and all my work ruined.

196
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,952
If you've no respect
for yourself

197
00:23:27,182 --> 00:23:30,282
you at least might have some
for me, who sweated over you.

198
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:34,581
A big, black mark, I tell you,
for every one we don't reclaim.

199
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:38,051
A confession of failure
for every one of you

200
00:23:38,361 --> 00:23:41,231
who ends up in the stripy hole.

201
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,301
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't.

202
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:46,191
The millicents have nothing
on me, brother.

203
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:47,771
Sir, I mean.

204
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,530
Cut out this clever talk
about millicents.

205
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,040
Just because the police
haven't picked you up

206
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,440
doesn't mean that you've not
been up to some nastiness.

207
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,260
There was a bit of
nastiness last night.

208
00:23:59,261 --> 00:24:01,810
Some very extreme
nastiness, yes?

209
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,279
A few of a certain Billy-boy's
friends were ambulanced off late.

210
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,919
Your name was mentioned.

211
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,389
The words got to me
by the usual channels.

212
00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:13,459
Certain friends of yours
were named also.

213
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:16,959
Nobody can prove anything
about anybody, as usual.

214
00:24:17,229 --> 00:24:18,758
I'm warning you, little Alex

215
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:21,298
being a good friend
to you as always

216
00:24:21,498 --> 00:24:24,298
the one man in this
sore and sick community

217
00:24:24,508 --> 00:24:27,238
who wants to save you
from yourself!

218
00:24:46,627 --> 00:24:48,357
What gets into you all?

219
00:24:48,597 --> 00:24:51,856
We've been studying the problem
for damn well near a century.

220
00:24:52,136 --> 00:24:54,256
But we get no farther
with our studies.

221
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:57,006
You got a good home here.
Good, loving parents.

222
00:24:57,266 --> 00:24:59,366
You've got not too bad of a brain.

223
00:24:59,676 --> 00:25:02,796
Is it some devil
that crawls inside of you?

224
00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:04,935
Nobody's got anything on me.

225
00:25:05,175 --> 00:25:07,945
I been out of the millicents'
rookers for a long time.

226
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:12,675
That's just what worries me.
A bit too long to be safe.

227
00:25:12,955 --> 00:25:14,785
You're about due, by my reckoning.

228
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,355
That's why I'm warning you

229
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:20,054
to keep your handsome
young proboscis out of the dirt.

230
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:21,684
Do I make myself clear?

231
00:25:21,894 --> 00:25:23,324
As an unmuddied lake, sir.

232
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,964
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

233
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:29,494
You can rely on me, sir.

234
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,219
Excuse me, brother.

235
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:41,089
I ordered this two weeks ago.
Can you see if it's arrived?

236
00:26:42,469 --> 00:26:43,799
Just a minute.

237
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:11,717
Pardon me, ladies.

238
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:22,926
Enjoying that, are you, my darling?

239
00:27:25,506 --> 00:27:28,836
A bit cold and pointless,
isn't it, my lovely?

240
00:27:33,246 --> 00:27:36,116
What's happened to yours,
my little sister?

241
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:39,755
Who you getting, bratty?

242
00:27:39,985 --> 00:27:42,115
Goggly Gogol?
Johnny Zhivago?

243
00:27:42,355 --> 00:27:44,255
The Heaven 17?

244
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:52,365
What you got back home
to play your fuzzy warbles on?

245
00:27:52,635 --> 00:27:56,864
I bet you've got little
pitiful, portable picnic players.

246
00:27:57,174 --> 00:27:59,294
Come with Uncle
and hear all proper.

247
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:02,604
Hear angel trumpets
and devil trombones.

248
00:28:02,844 --> 00:28:04,864
You are invited.

249
00:29:27,258 --> 00:29:28,218
Hi, hi, hi, there.

250
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:29,448
Well, hello.

251
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,348
He are here!
He have arrived!

252
00:29:32,598 --> 00:29:34,188
Hooray!

253
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:37,628
Welly, welly, welly,
welly, welly, welly, well!

254
00:29:39,368 --> 00:29:44,067
To what do I owe the extreme pleasure
of this surprising visit?

255
00:29:49,407 --> 00:29:51,107
We got worried.

256
00:29:53,977 --> 00:29:58,886
There we were, waiting and drinking
away at the old knifey moloko

257
00:29:59,586 --> 00:30:01,646
and you had not turned up.

258
00:30:02,116 --> 00:30:04,316
And we thought
you might have been, like

259
00:30:04,556 --> 00:30:06,886
offended by something
or other.

260
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:09,556
So around we come to your abode.

261
00:30:14,935 --> 00:30:17,125
Appy polly loggies.

262
00:30:17,435 --> 00:30:20,565
I had something of a pain
in the gulliver, so I had to sleep.

263
00:30:20,835 --> 00:30:23,635
I was not awakened
when I gave orders for wakening.

264
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,305
Sorry about the pain.

265
00:30:27,014 --> 00:30:29,504
Using the gulliver
too much-like, maybe.

266
00:30:32,754 --> 00:30:36,184
Giving orders and
discipline and such, perhaps.

267
00:30:36,684 --> 00:30:38,984
You sure the pain is gone?

268
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:42,513
You sure you'd not
be happier back in bed?

269
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:08,312
Let's get things nice
and sparkling clear.

270
00:31:11,682 --> 00:31:14,181
This sarcasm,
if I may call it such

271
00:31:14,391 --> 00:31:17,151
does not become you,
my little brothers.

272
00:31:17,691 --> 00:31:22,131
As I am your droog and leader
I'm entitled to know what goes on.

273
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:25,191
Now then, Dim.

274
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:29,630
What does that great big
horsey gape of a grin portend?

275
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,370
All right, no more
picking on Dim, brother.

276
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,080
That's part of the new way.

277
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:49,749
New way?
What's this about a new way?

278
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:55,929
There's been some very large talk
behind my sleeping back, I know it.

279
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:00,258
If you must have it,
have it, then.

280
00:32:01,068 --> 00:32:03,688
We go around shop crasting
and the like

281
00:32:03,938 --> 00:32:07,528
coming out with a pitiful
rookerfull of money each.

282
00:32:07,868 --> 00:32:10,168
And Will the English
in the coffee mesto

283
00:32:10,408 --> 00:32:13,998
saying he can fence anything
any malchick tries to crast.

284
00:32:14,248 --> 00:32:16,177
The shiny stuff. The ice!

285
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:20,437
The big, big money's available,
is what Will the English says.

286
00:32:22,517 --> 00:32:25,787
And what will you do
with the big, big, big money?

287
00:32:26,087 --> 00:32:27,957
Have you not everything you need?

288
00:32:28,257 --> 00:32:31,126
If you need a motorcar,
you pluck it from the trees.

289
00:32:31,426 --> 00:32:34,456
If you need pretty polly,
you take it.

290
00:32:34,696 --> 00:32:39,256
Brother, you think and talk
sometimes like a little child.

291
00:32:40,136 --> 00:32:42,696
Tonight we pull a man-size crast.

292
00:32:44,606 --> 00:32:46,975
Good! Real horror show!

293
00:32:47,205 --> 00:32:49,575
Initiative comes
to thems that wait.

294
00:32:50,245 --> 00:32:53,235
I've taught you much,
my little droogies.

295
00:32:54,645 --> 00:32:58,045
Now tell me what you had in mind,
Georgie-boy.

296
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:04,584
The old moloko plus first.
Would you not say?

297
00:33:04,824 --> 00:33:08,624
- Something to sharpen us up.
- Some moloko plus.

298
00:33:10,164 --> 00:33:14,994
You got to go there first.
We got a start on you. Moloko Plus!

299
00:33:22,913 --> 00:33:25,343
As we walked along
the flatblock marina

300
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:29,843
I was calm on the outside,
but thinking all the time.

301
00:33:30,113 --> 00:33:32,642
So now it was to be
Georgie the General

302
00:33:32,952 --> 00:33:35,352
saying what we should do
and what not to do.

303
00:33:35,622 --> 00:33:39,522
And Dim as his mindless,
grinning bulldog.

304
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:43,422
But suddenly I viddied that
thinking was for the gloopy ones

305
00:33:43,692 --> 00:33:48,821
and that the oomny ones used, like,
inspiration and what Bog sends.

306
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:53,171
For now it was lovely music
that came to my aid.

307
00:33:53,441 --> 00:33:56,501
There was a window open
with a stereo on

308
00:33:56,771 --> 00:34:00,001
and I viddied right at once
what to do.

309
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:09,166
I had not cut into any
of Dim's main cables.

310
00:35:09,406 --> 00:35:11,706
And so with the help
of a clean tashtook

311
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:14,276
the red, red kroovy
soon stopped.

312
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:18,246
And it did not take long to
quieten the two wounded soldiers

313
00:35:18,445 --> 00:35:21,175
down in the snug
of the Duke of New York.

314
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:25,575
Now they knew who was
master and leader.

315
00:35:26,095 --> 00:35:28,025
Sheep, thought I.

316
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:30,455
But a real leader knows
always when, like

317
00:35:30,725 --> 00:35:33,924
to give and show generous
to his unders.

318
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,764
Now we're back to where we were.

319
00:35:39,064 --> 00:35:40,364
Yes?

320
00:35:41,204 --> 00:35:43,464
Just like before,
and all forgotten?

321
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,364
Right, right, right?

322
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:48,274
Right.

323
00:35:51,143 --> 00:35:52,273
Right.

324
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:56,743
Right.

325
00:35:59,723 --> 00:36:01,883
Well, Georgie-boy

326
00:36:02,223 --> 00:36:06,092
this idea of yours for tonight.
Tell us all about it, then.

327
00:36:07,762 --> 00:36:08,822
Not tonight.

328
00:36:09,132 --> 00:36:10,762
Not this nochy.

329
00:36:11,432 --> 00:36:13,962
Come, come, come, Georgie-boy.

330
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,832
You're a big, strong chelloveck,
like us all.

331
00:36:18,102 --> 00:36:21,401
We're not little children,
are we, Georgie-boy?

332
00:36:22,071 --> 00:36:25,741
What, then, didst thou
in thy mind have?

333
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:34,451
It's this health farm.

334
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,580
A bit out of the town.

335
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,080
Isolated.

336
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,820
It's owned by this rich ptitsa
who lives there with her cats.

337
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:50,929
The place is shut down for a week
and she's completely on her own.

338
00:36:52,269 --> 00:36:55,969
It's full up with, like,
gold and silver

339
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:58,199
and, like, jewels.

340
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,509
Tell me more, Georgie-boy.
Tell me more.

341
00:37:09,218 --> 00:37:10,618
Oh, shit!

342
00:37:29,407 --> 00:37:30,237
Who's there?

343
00:37:30,837 --> 00:37:32,827
Excuse me, can you please help?

344
00:37:33,077 --> 00:37:34,637
There's been a terrible accident!

345
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:37,816
Can I please use your telephone
for an ambulance?

346
00:37:38,846 --> 00:37:40,816
I'm frightfully sorry.

347
00:37:41,716 --> 00:37:45,246
There's a telephone in the
public house a mile down the road.

348
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:47,356
I suggest you use that.

349
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,576
But missus, this is an emergency!

350
00:37:49,856 --> 00:37:51,656
It's a matter of life and death!

351
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:55,655
Me friend's lying in the middle
of the road, bleeding to death!

352
00:37:56,665 --> 00:38:01,655
I'm very sorry, but I never open
the door to strangers after dark.

353
00:38:04,035 --> 00:38:05,835
Very well, madam.

354
00:38:06,205 --> 00:38:08,404
You can't be blamed
for being suspicious

355
00:38:08,674 --> 00:38:12,444
with so many scoundrels
and rogues of the night about.

356
00:38:12,714 --> 00:38:15,274
I'll try and get help
at the pub, then.

357
00:38:15,514 --> 00:38:17,954
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

358
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:21,274
Thank you very much.
Good night.

359
00:38:57,921 --> 00:38:59,321
Dim, bend down.

360
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:04,591
I'll get in that window
and open the front door.

361
00:39:33,189 --> 00:39:34,989
Radlett Police Station?

362
00:39:35,259 --> 00:39:39,159
Good evening. It's Miss Weathers
at Woodmere Health Farm.

363
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:45,158
I'm sorry to bother you, but
something rather odd just happened.

364
00:39:45,368 --> 00:39:48,268
It's probably nothing at all,
but you never know.

365
00:39:49,168 --> 00:39:52,498
A young man rang the bell,
asking to use the telephone.

366
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:54,997
He said there's been
some kind of accident.

367
00:39:55,307 --> 00:39:57,707
The thing that caught my
attention was what he said.

368
00:39:57,977 --> 00:40:01,847
His words sounded like those quoted
in the papers this morning

369
00:40:02,117 --> 00:40:06,317
in connection with the writer
and his wife who were assaulted.

370
00:40:07,617 --> 00:40:09,647
Just a few minutes ago.

371
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:13,686
If you think that's necessary.

372
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,656
But I'm quite sure
he's gone away now.

373
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:19,996
All right, fine.

374
00:40:20,966 --> 00:40:23,056
Thank you very much.

375
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:29,235
Hi, hi, hi, there.

376
00:40:29,505 --> 00:40:30,875
At last we meet.

377
00:40:31,075 --> 00:40:35,735
Our brief govorett through the
letter-hole was not satisfactory.

378
00:40:37,045 --> 00:40:38,345
Who are you?

379
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:41,514
How the hell did you get in here?

380
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:46,754
What the bloody hell
do you think you're doing?

381
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:52,594
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

382
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:55,424
You filthy old soomaka.

383
00:40:55,694 --> 00:40:59,263
Now listen here,
you little bastard!

384
00:40:59,533 --> 00:41:02,993
Just turn round and walk out
of here the same way you came in.

385
00:41:06,203 --> 00:41:07,693
Leave that alone!
Don't touch it!

386
00:41:07,943 --> 00:41:10,373
It's a very important work of art.

387
00:41:21,192 --> 00:41:23,622
What the bloody hell do you want?

388
00:41:24,962 --> 00:41:27,861
To be perfectly honest, madam

389
00:41:28,131 --> 00:41:31,461
I'm taking part in an
international students' contest

390
00:41:31,701 --> 00:41:35,461
to see who can get the most
points for selling magazines.

391
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,791
Cut the shit, sonny

392
00:41:38,071 --> 00:41:42,630
and get out of here before you
get yourself into serious trouble.

393
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:46,030
I told you to leave that alone!
Now get out of here

394
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,140
before I throw you out!

395
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:51,450
Wretched, slummy bedbug!

396
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:55,710
I'll teach you to break
into real people's houses.

397
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,889
Fucking

398
00:41:58,119 --> 00:41:59,109
little

399
00:41:59,729 --> 00:42:01,219
bastard!

400
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:13,825
- Let's go. The police are coming!
- One minoota, droogie.

401
00:43:20,534 --> 00:43:23,334
You bastards! I'm blind!

402
00:43:23,574 --> 00:43:27,634
I'm blind, you bastards!
I can't see!

403
00:43:41,523 --> 00:43:44,712
It's no good sitting there in hope,
my little brothers.

404
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:49,222
I won't say a single solitary
slovo unless I have my lawyer here.

405
00:43:49,562 --> 00:43:52,152
I know the law, you bastards.

406
00:44:00,002 --> 00:44:01,661
Righty-right, Tom.

407
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:07,041
We'll have to show our friend Alex
here that we know the law too.

408
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:09,941
But that knowing the law
isn't everything.

409
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:27,520
Nasty cut you've got there,
little Alex.

410
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:30,430
Shame, isn't it?

411
00:44:31,299 --> 00:44:33,359
Spoils all your beauty.

412
00:44:35,399 --> 00:44:37,029
Who gave you that, then?

413
00:44:38,469 --> 00:44:40,199
How'd you do that, then?

414
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:44,769
What's your point, you bastard?

415
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:47,238
That is for your lady victim.

416
00:44:47,548 --> 00:44:48,738
You ghastly

417
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,708
wretched scoundrel.

418
00:44:53,088 --> 00:44:54,278
Get him off me!

419
00:44:55,258 --> 00:44:57,378
You rotten little bastard!

420
00:45:05,627 --> 00:45:06,897
Good evening, Mr. Deltoid.

421
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,797
Good evening, Sergeant.

422
00:45:09,067 --> 00:45:10,157
They're in room B, sir.

423
00:45:10,437 --> 00:45:12,067
Thank you very much.

424
00:45:13,067 --> 00:45:14,227
Sergeant

425
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:15,407
Good evening.

426
00:45:15,677 --> 00:45:17,136
Good evening, Inspector.

427
00:45:17,406 --> 00:45:20,306
- Would you like your tea now, sir?
- No, thank you, Sergeant.

428
00:45:20,576 --> 00:45:22,516
May I have some
paper towels, please?

429
00:45:22,816 --> 00:45:25,076
We're interrogating
the prisoner now.

430
00:45:25,286 --> 00:45:28,916
- Perhaps you'd care to come inside.
- Thank you very much.

431
00:45:29,486 --> 00:45:32,455
Good evening, Sergeant.
Good evening, all.

432
00:45:34,455 --> 00:45:37,585
Oh, dear! This boy
does look a mess, doesn't he?

433
00:45:37,825 --> 00:45:39,655
Just look at the state of him.

434
00:45:39,935 --> 00:45:41,865
Love's young nightmare-like.

435
00:45:42,135 --> 00:45:44,035
Violence makes violence.

436
00:45:44,305 --> 00:45:46,295
He resisted his lawful arrestors.

437
00:45:47,834 --> 00:45:51,104
This is the end of the line for me.

438
00:45:51,304 --> 00:45:54,474
The end of the line, yes.

439
00:45:54,844 --> 00:45:56,314
And what of me, brother sir?

440
00:45:56,514 --> 00:45:58,204
Speak up for me.
I'm not so bad.

441
00:45:58,484 --> 00:46:00,474
I was led on by
the treachery of others.

442
00:46:00,714 --> 00:46:03,613
Sings the roof off lovely,
he does, sir.

443
00:46:03,853 --> 00:46:07,113
Where are my treacherous droogs?
Get them before they get away!

444
00:46:07,353 --> 00:46:09,183
It was all their idea, brothers.

445
00:46:09,453 --> 00:46:12,123
They forced me to do it.
I'm innocent!

446
00:46:18,862 --> 00:46:21,562
You are now a murderer,
little Alex.

447
00:46:22,302 --> 00:46:23,562
A murderer.

448
00:46:24,402 --> 00:46:26,392
Not true, sir.

449
00:46:26,642 --> 00:46:28,472
It was only a slight tolchok.

450
00:46:28,672 --> 00:46:31,202
She were breathing, I swear it.

451
00:46:31,682 --> 00:46:33,871
I've just come from the hospital.

452
00:46:34,151 --> 00:46:36,411
Your victim has died.

453
00:46:36,681 --> 00:46:39,841
You try to frighten me.
Admit so, sir.

454
00:46:40,091 --> 00:46:42,051
This is some new form of torture.

455
00:46:42,321 --> 00:46:45,591
- Say it, brother sir.
- It'll be your own torture.

456
00:46:45,861 --> 00:46:49,660
I hope to God
it'll torture you to madness.

457
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,590
If you'd care to give him a bash
in the chops, don't mind us.

458
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:56,600
We'll hold him down.

459
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,530
He must be a great
disappointment to you, sir.

460
00:47:29,968 --> 00:47:33,628
This is the real weepy and tragic
part of the story beginning

461
00:47:33,908 --> 00:47:36,097
O my brothers and only friends.

462
00:47:36,407 --> 00:47:38,807
After a trial,
with judges and a jury

463
00:47:39,077 --> 00:47:43,307
and hard words spoken against
your friend and humble narrator

464
00:47:43,617 --> 00:47:47,707
he was sentenced to 14 years
in Staja Number 84-F

465
00:47:47,917 --> 00:47:51,446
among smelly perverts
and hardened prestoopniks.

466
00:47:51,756 --> 00:47:55,556
The shock sending my dada beating
his bruised and krovvy rookers

467
00:47:55,786 --> 00:47:58,126
against unfair Bog
in His Heaven.

468
00:47:58,396 --> 00:48:01,586
And my mum boo-hoo-hooing
in her mother's grief

469
00:48:01,826 --> 00:48:04,226
at her only child
and son of her bosom

470
00:48:04,496 --> 00:48:07,095
like, letting everybody down
real horror show.

471
00:48:07,335 --> 00:48:10,235
Morning.
One up from Thames, mister.

472
00:48:11,275 --> 00:48:12,895
Right! Open up the cell!

473
00:48:13,135 --> 00:48:14,575
Yes, sir.

474
00:48:30,854 --> 00:48:33,124
Here are the prisoner's
committal forms.

475
00:48:33,354 --> 00:48:34,844
Thank you, mister.

476
00:48:36,493 --> 00:48:39,193
- Name?
- Alexander DeLarge.

477
00:48:39,463 --> 00:48:41,363
You are now in
H.M. Prison Parkmoor.

478
00:48:41,663 --> 00:48:45,193
From this moment, you will address
all prison officers as "sir"

479
00:48:45,433 --> 00:48:46,263
Name?

480
00:48:46,473 --> 00:48:48,833
Alexander DeLarge, sir.

481
00:48:49,143 --> 00:48:50,133
Sentence?

482
00:48:50,443 --> 00:48:51,602
14 years, sir.

483
00:48:51,842 --> 00:48:52,702
Crime?

484
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:54,102
Murder, sir.

485
00:48:54,382 --> 00:48:57,312
Right.
Take the cuffs off him, mister.

486
00:49:08,621 --> 00:49:11,021
You are now 655321.

487
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:14,521
It is your duty
to memorize that number.

488
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:16,821
Thank you, mister. Well done.

489
00:49:17,071 --> 00:49:18,791
- Thank you.
- Let the officer out.

490
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,560
All right, empty your pockets.

491
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:32,400
Are you able to see the white line
painted on the floor

492
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,010
directly behind you

493
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,580
655321?

494
00:49:38,089 --> 00:49:39,519
Then your toes belong

495
00:49:39,749 --> 00:49:41,719
on the other side of it!

496
00:49:48,759 --> 00:49:50,419
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

497
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:52,199
Carry on.

498
00:49:57,068 --> 00:49:57,998
Pick that up

499
00:49:58,238 --> 00:50:00,998
and put it down properly.

500
00:50:11,787 --> 00:50:13,847
One half-bar of chocolate.

501
00:50:15,857 --> 00:50:18,757
One bunch of keys
on white metal ring.

502
00:50:21,857 --> 00:50:23,756
One packet of cigarettes.

503
00:50:26,966 --> 00:50:29,096
Two plastic ball pens.

504
00:50:29,366 --> 00:50:31,426
One black, one red.

505
00:50:34,636 --> 00:50:37,866
One pocket comb, black plastic.

506
00:50:38,446 --> 00:50:42,935
One address book,
imitation red leather.

507
00:50:51,725 --> 00:50:53,655
One ten-penny piece.

508
00:50:55,124 --> 00:50:57,714
One white metal wristlet watch

509
00:50:57,994 --> 00:51:01,954
Timawrist, on a white metal
expanding bracelet.

510
00:51:03,134 --> 00:51:05,064
Anything else in your pockets?

511
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,594
- No, sir.
- Right.

512
00:51:07,904 --> 00:51:10,963
Sign here for your
valuable property.

513
00:51:19,813 --> 00:51:21,903
The tobacco and chocolate
you brought in

514
00:51:22,153 --> 00:51:23,443
you lose that

515
00:51:23,683 --> 00:51:25,812
as you are now convicted.

516
00:51:26,682 --> 00:51:29,922
Now over to the table
and get undressed.

517
00:51:36,932 --> 00:51:38,922
Were you in police custody
this morning?

518
00:51:39,202 --> 00:51:40,661
One jacket, blue pinstriped.

519
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:41,991
Prison custody?

520
00:51:42,271 --> 00:51:43,331
Yes, sir, on remand.

521
00:51:43,531 --> 00:51:45,431
- One necktie, blue.
- Religion?

522
00:51:45,671 --> 00:51:46,761
C. of E., sir.

523
00:51:47,011 --> 00:51:48,701
Do you mean the Church of England?

524
00:51:48,941 --> 00:51:50,701
Yes, sir.
The Church of England.

525
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:51,931
Brown hair, isn't it?

526
00:51:52,181 --> 00:51:53,341
Fair hair, sir.

527
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:54,641
Blue eyes?

528
00:51:54,881 --> 00:51:56,280
Blue, sir.

529
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:59,110
Do you wear eyeglasses
or contact lenses?

530
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,210
No, sir.

531
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,390
One shirt, blue.
Collar attached.

532
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:06,390
Have you been receiving medical
treatment for any serious illness?

533
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,180
One pair of boots, black leather.
Zippered. Worn.

534
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,949
Have you ever had
any mental illness?

535
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:16,059
Do you wear any false teeth
or any false limbs?

536
00:52:16,529 --> 00:52:18,559
One pair of trousers,
blue pinstriped.

537
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:22,169
Have you ever had any attacks
of fainting or dizziness?

538
00:52:22,409 --> 00:52:23,999
One pair of socks, black.

539
00:52:24,209 --> 00:52:26,009
Are you an epileptic?

540
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,738
One pair of underpants,
white with blue waistband.

541
00:52:28,978 --> 00:52:32,678
Are you now, or have you ever been,
a homosexual?

542
00:52:33,148 --> 00:52:34,018
Right.

543
00:52:34,248 --> 00:52:36,808
- The mothballs, mister.
- Mothballs, sir.

544
00:52:37,718 --> 00:52:39,158
Now then, face the wall

545
00:52:39,558 --> 00:52:42,217
bend over and touch your toes.

546
00:52:48,827 --> 00:52:50,357
Any venereal disease?

547
00:52:50,597 --> 00:52:52,157
Crabs? Lice?

548
00:52:52,367 --> 00:52:55,397
- Through there for the bath.
- One for a bath.

549
00:52:57,436 --> 00:52:58,696
What's it going to be, eh?

550
00:52:59,606 --> 00:53:03,066
Is it going to be in and out
of institutions like this

551
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,336
though more in than out
for most of you?

552
00:53:05,576 --> 00:53:09,676
Or are you going to attend
to the divine word

553
00:53:09,946 --> 00:53:13,615
and realize the punishments
that await unrepentant sinners

554
00:53:13,925 --> 00:53:16,015
in the next world
as well as this?

555
00:53:16,255 --> 00:53:18,285
A lot of idiots you are

556
00:53:18,525 --> 00:53:23,185
selling your birthright
for a saucer of cold porridge.

557
00:53:23,465 --> 00:53:25,125
The thrill of theft.

558
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:26,225
Of violence.

559
00:53:26,465 --> 00:53:29,124
The urge to live easy.

560
00:53:29,404 --> 00:53:32,064
Well, I ask you what is it worth

561
00:53:32,304 --> 00:53:34,704
when we have undeniable proof

562
00:53:34,944 --> 00:53:38,064
yes, incontrovertible
evidence

563
00:53:38,274 --> 00:53:39,604
that hell exists?

564
00:53:39,874 --> 00:53:41,074
I know!

565
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,873
I know, my friends.

566
00:53:44,113 --> 00:53:46,213
I have been informed

567
00:53:46,453 --> 00:53:47,943
in visions

568
00:53:48,223 --> 00:53:49,713
that there is a place

569
00:53:49,923 --> 00:53:52,323
darker than any prison

570
00:53:52,623 --> 00:53:56,653
hotter than any flame
of human fire

571
00:53:56,923 --> 00:53:58,223
where souls

572
00:53:58,462 --> 00:54:02,662
of unrepentant criminal sinners
like yourselves

573
00:54:04,572 --> 00:54:08,262
Don't you laugh, damn you!
Don't you laugh.

574
00:54:08,472 --> 00:54:11,502
I say, like yourselves

575
00:54:12,012 --> 00:54:13,342
scream

576
00:54:13,742 --> 00:54:17,401
in endless and
unendurable agony.

577
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:19,511
Their skin

578
00:54:19,781 --> 00:54:22,271
rotting and peeling.

579
00:54:22,521 --> 00:54:24,281
A fireball

580
00:54:24,521 --> 00:54:26,851
spinning in their
screaming guts!

581
00:54:27,121 --> 00:54:30,520
I know. Yes, I know!

582
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:39,820
All right, you lot!
We'll end by singing hymn 258

583
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,430
in the prisoner's hymnal.

584
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:44,869
And let's have a little reverence,
you bastards!

585
00:54:46,509 --> 00:54:49,809
I was a wandering sheep

586
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:53,509
- Sing up, damn you!
- I did not love the fold

587
00:54:53,779 --> 00:54:55,179
Louder!

588
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:02,508
I did not love my shepherd's voice

589
00:55:03,158 --> 00:55:07,528
I would not be controlled

590
00:55:08,698 --> 00:55:09,788
Louder!

591
00:55:10,228 --> 00:55:13,288
It had not been edifying.
Indeed not.

592
00:55:13,528 --> 00:55:17,467
Being in this hellhole
and human zoo for two years now.

593
00:55:17,707 --> 00:55:20,827
Being kicked and tolchoked
by brutal warders

594
00:55:21,077 --> 00:55:24,037
and meeting leering criminals
and perverts

595
00:55:24,307 --> 00:55:25,837
ready to dribble all over

596
00:55:26,077 --> 00:55:29,017
a luscious young malchick
like your storyteller.

597
00:55:35,016 --> 00:55:36,506
It was my rabbit

598
00:55:36,816 --> 00:55:39,516
to help the prison charlie
with the Sunday service.

599
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:42,816
He was a bolshy,
great burly bastard.

600
00:55:43,056 --> 00:55:46,155
But he was very fond of myself,
me being very young

601
00:55:46,395 --> 00:55:49,765
and also now very interested
in the Big Book.

602
00:56:10,884 --> 00:56:14,684
I read all about the scourging
and the crowning with thorns.

603
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,853
And I could viddy myself
helping in

604
00:56:17,093 --> 00:56:21,053
and even taking charge of
the tolchoking and the nailing in.

605
00:56:21,293 --> 00:56:24,633
Being dressed in the height
of Roman fashion.

606
00:56:36,572 --> 00:56:39,072
I didn't so much like
the latter part of the Book

607
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,472
which is more like
all preachy talking

608
00:56:41,752 --> 00:56:43,872
than fighting
and the old in-out.

609
00:56:44,122 --> 00:56:47,241
I like the parts where these old
yahoodies tolchok each other

610
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:49,751
and then drink
their Hebrew vino

611
00:56:50,121 --> 00:56:53,221
and getting onto the bed
with their wives' handmaidens.

612
00:56:53,421 --> 00:56:55,451
That kept me going.

613
00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:29,689
"Seek not to be like evil men.

614
00:57:30,129 --> 00:57:32,249
Neither desire to be with them

615
00:57:32,499 --> 00:57:35,618
because their minds
studieth robberies

616
00:57:35,868 --> 00:57:38,768
and their lips speak deceits"

617
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:42,488
If thou lose hope, being weary
in the days of distress

618
00:57:42,768 --> 00:57:45,038
thy strength
shall be diminished.

619
00:57:45,308 --> 00:57:46,938
Fine, my son. Fine.

620
00:57:47,178 --> 00:57:48,478
Father?

621
00:57:52,517 --> 00:57:54,207
I have tried, have I not?

622
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:55,607
You have, my son.

623
00:57:55,817 --> 00:57:58,147
- I've done my best, have I not?
- Indeed.

624
00:57:58,387 --> 00:58:01,827
I've never been guilty of any
institutional infraction, have I?

625
00:58:02,027 --> 00:58:06,356
You certainly have not, 655321.
You've been very helpful.

626
00:58:06,626 --> 00:58:09,496
And you've shown
a genuine desire to reform.

627
00:58:09,726 --> 00:58:11,026
Father

628
00:58:12,496 --> 00:58:15,296
can I ask you
a question in private?

629
00:58:16,906 --> 00:58:18,836
Certainly, my son. Certainly.

630
00:58:29,045 --> 00:58:31,535
Is there something
troubling you, my son?

631
00:58:34,684 --> 00:58:36,984
Don't be shy to speak up.

632
00:58:39,494 --> 00:58:40,824
Remember

633
00:58:41,064 --> 00:58:43,024
I know of the

634
00:58:43,264 --> 00:58:47,094
urges that can
trouble young men

635
00:58:47,364 --> 00:58:48,894
deprived

636
00:58:49,104 --> 00:58:51,093
of the society of women.

637
00:58:54,003 --> 00:58:56,333
It's nothing like that, Father.

638
00:59:00,073 --> 00:59:03,443
It's about this new thing
they're all talking about.

639
00:59:04,013 --> 00:59:05,672
About this new treatment.

640
00:59:05,912 --> 00:59:08,282
It gets you out of prison
in no time.

641
00:59:08,552 --> 00:59:11,072
And makes sure you
never get back in again.

642
00:59:11,892 --> 00:59:14,122
Where did you hear about this?

643
00:59:14,392 --> 00:59:17,082
Who's been talking
about these things?

644
00:59:17,362 --> 00:59:19,762
These things get around.

645
00:59:20,032 --> 00:59:22,291
Two warders talk, as it might be.

646
00:59:22,531 --> 00:59:25,561
And somebody can't help
overhearing what they say.

647
00:59:26,101 --> 00:59:29,471
Then somebody picks up a scrap
of newspaper in the workshops

648
00:59:29,741 --> 00:59:32,371
and the newspaper
tells all about it.

649
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:38,970
How about putting me in
for this new treatment?

650
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:44,280
I take it you are referring

651
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,780
to the Ludovico technique.

652
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,890
I don't know what it's called.

653
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,989
I just know it
gets you out quickly

654
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:54,759
and makes sure you
never get back in again.

655
00:59:55,459 --> 00:59:58,329
That is not proven, 655321.

656
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:02,729
In fact, it is only in the
experimental stage at this moment.

657
01:00:03,169 --> 01:00:05,969
It has been used, hasn't it?

658
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:08,968
It has not been used
in this prison yet.

659
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:11,638
The governor has grave
doubts about it.

660
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:15,608
And I've heard there are
very serious dangers involved.

661
01:00:17,588 --> 01:00:20,488
I don't care about the dangers.

662
01:00:22,157 --> 01:00:24,317
I just want to be good.

663
01:00:25,587 --> 01:00:28,257
I want for the rest
of my life to be

664
01:00:28,497 --> 01:00:30,587
one act of goodness.

665
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:32,297
The question is

666
01:00:32,697 --> 01:00:37,357
whether or not this technique
really makes a man good.

667
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:40,496
Goodness comes from within.

668
01:00:40,706 --> 01:00:41,826
Goodness

669
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:43,466
is chosen.

670
01:00:43,836 --> 01:00:45,966
When a man cannot choose

671
01:00:46,206 --> 01:00:48,366
he ceases to be a man.

672
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:55,105
I don't understand about
the whys and wherefores, Father.

673
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:59,225
I only know I want to be good.

674
01:01:01,355 --> 01:01:03,295
Be patient, my son.

675
01:01:03,495 --> 01:01:05,725
Put your trust in the Lord.

676
01:01:07,635 --> 01:01:11,224
Instruct Thy Son
and He shall refresh thee

677
01:01:11,504 --> 01:01:14,364
and shall give delight
to thy soul.

678
01:01:14,974 --> 01:01:16,234
Amen.

679
01:01:44,062 --> 01:01:46,032
- Mister!
- All present and correct, sir!

680
01:01:46,232 --> 01:01:47,252
Right!

681
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,932
All present and correct, sir!

682
01:02:46,558 --> 01:02:48,048
Prisoners, halt!

683
01:02:48,628 --> 01:02:50,218
Now pay attention!

684
01:02:50,928 --> 01:02:52,728
I want you in two lines

685
01:02:52,928 --> 01:02:55,587
up against that wall,
facing this way.

686
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,387
Go on, move!

687
01:02:57,937 --> 01:02:58,897
Hurry up!

688
01:02:59,167 --> 01:03:00,427
Stop talking!

689
01:03:06,277 --> 01:03:08,837
Prisoners ready
for inspection, sir!

690
01:03:24,826 --> 01:03:26,016
How many to a cell?

691
01:03:26,295 --> 01:03:28,125
Four in this block, sir.

692
01:03:28,995 --> 01:03:31,295
Cram criminals together
and what do you get?

693
01:03:31,495 --> 01:03:34,665
Concentrated criminality.
Crime in the midst of punishment.

694
01:03:34,935 --> 01:03:38,635
I agree, sir. We need
larger prisons, more money.

695
01:03:38,835 --> 01:03:40,665
Not a chance, my dear fellow.

696
01:03:40,875 --> 01:03:43,204
The government can't be
concerned any longer

697
01:03:43,474 --> 01:03:45,174
with outmoded
penalogical theories.

698
01:03:45,474 --> 01:03:49,104
Soon we may need all prison
space for political offenders.

699
01:03:49,344 --> 01:03:52,874
Common criminals are best dealt
with on a purely curative basis.

700
01:03:53,184 --> 01:03:55,844
Kill the criminal reflex,
that's all.

701
01:03:56,124 --> 01:03:58,313
Full implementation
in a year's time.

702
01:03:58,623 --> 01:04:00,813
Punishment means nothing to them.

703
01:04:01,063 --> 01:04:03,993
They enjoy their
so-called punishment.

704
01:04:04,293 --> 01:04:05,383
You're absolutely right, sir.

705
01:04:05,663 --> 01:04:08,223
Shut your bleeding hole!

706
01:04:08,903 --> 01:04:10,393
Who said that?

707
01:04:11,033 --> 01:04:12,462
I did, sir.

708
01:04:18,712 --> 01:04:20,402
What crime did you commit?

709
01:04:20,672 --> 01:04:22,732
The accidental killing
of a person, sir.

710
01:04:23,012 --> 01:04:25,712
He brutally murdered a woman
in furtherance of theft.

711
01:04:25,982 --> 01:04:27,571
Fourteen years, sir.

712
01:04:28,881 --> 01:04:30,041
Excellent.

713
01:04:31,591 --> 01:04:32,811
He's enterprising

714
01:04:33,021 --> 01:04:34,081
aggressive

715
01:04:34,361 --> 01:04:35,521
outgoing

716
01:04:35,761 --> 01:04:36,591
young

717
01:04:36,861 --> 01:04:38,191
bold

718
01:04:38,391 --> 01:04:39,921
vicious.

719
01:04:40,391 --> 01:04:41,421
He'll do.

720
01:04:41,701 --> 01:04:42,821
Fine.

721
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:44,550
We could still look at C-block.

722
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:46,860
No, no. That's enough.
He's perfect.

723
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:48,830
I want his records sent to me.

724
01:04:49,070 --> 01:04:50,400
This vicious young hoodlum

725
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,600
will be transformed
out of all recognition.

726
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,830
Thank you very much
for this chance.

727
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,840
Let's hope you make
the most of it, my boy.

728
01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:00,599
- Shall we go to my office?
- Thank you.

729
01:05:07,419 --> 01:05:08,719
Come in.

730
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:11,389
Sir!

731
01:05:11,589 --> 01:05:13,529
655321. Sir!

732
01:05:13,728 --> 01:05:14,718
Very good, Chief.

733
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:16,518
Over to the line.
Toes behind it.

734
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:19,268
Full name and number
to the governor.

735
01:05:20,098 --> 01:05:23,298
Alexander DeLarge, sir.
655321, sir.

736
01:05:26,038 --> 01:05:29,097
I don't suppose you know who
that was this morning.

737
01:05:29,377 --> 01:05:32,967
That was no less a personage
than the Minister of the Interior.

738
01:05:33,277 --> 01:05:35,207
The new Minister of the Interior.

739
01:05:35,477 --> 01:05:38,377
What they call a very new broom.

740
01:05:39,587 --> 01:05:42,987
These new ridiculous ideas
have come at last.

741
01:05:43,257 --> 01:05:45,556
And orders are orders

742
01:05:45,786 --> 01:05:49,316
though I may say to you
in confidence, I do not approve.

743
01:05:49,596 --> 01:05:51,826
An eye for an eye, I say.

744
01:05:52,126 --> 01:05:55,066
If someone hits you,
you hit back, do you not?

745
01:05:55,336 --> 01:05:58,996
Why should not the state,
severely hit by you hooligans

746
01:05:59,306 --> 01:06:01,065
not hit back also?

747
01:06:01,935 --> 01:06:03,905
The new view is to say "no"

748
01:06:04,135 --> 01:06:07,505
The new view is that
we turn the bad into good.

749
01:06:07,775 --> 01:06:10,765
All of which seems to me
to be grossly unjust.

750
01:06:11,145 --> 01:06:13,675
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!

751
01:06:14,145 --> 01:06:16,344
You are to be reformed.

752
01:06:17,184 --> 01:06:19,674
Tomorrow you will go
to this man, Brodsky.

753
01:06:19,984 --> 01:06:21,514
You will be leaving here.

754
01:06:21,794 --> 01:06:26,024
You will be transferred to
the Ludovico medical facility.

755
01:06:26,324 --> 01:06:30,263
It's believed you'll be able to
leave state custody in a fortnight.

756
01:06:30,493 --> 01:06:32,363
I suppose that prospect
pleases you?

757
01:06:32,663 --> 01:06:34,433
Answer the governor's question!

758
01:06:34,703 --> 01:06:36,033
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.

759
01:06:36,273 --> 01:06:38,603
I've done my best here,
I really have, sir.

760
01:06:38,873 --> 01:06:41,103
I'm very grateful
to all concerned, sir.

761
01:06:43,343 --> 01:06:45,712
Sign this where it's marked.

762
01:06:48,882 --> 01:06:50,942
Don't read it, sign it!

763
01:06:51,222 --> 01:06:54,882
It says you're willing to have
your sentence commuted

764
01:06:55,152 --> 01:06:58,122
to submission to
the Ludovico treatment.

765
01:06:58,362 --> 01:06:59,692
And this.

766
01:07:06,861 --> 01:07:08,461
And another copy.

767
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:22,880
The next morning I was taken to

768
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,810
the Ludovico medical facility

769
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:26,880
outside the town center.

770
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:28,580
I felt a malenky bit sad

771
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:30,750
having to say goodbye
to the old Staja

772
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:34,319
as you will, when you leave
a place you've gotten used to.

773
01:07:34,529 --> 01:07:36,519
Right, halt the prisoner.

774
01:07:41,999 --> 01:07:44,429
Good morning, sir.
I'm Chief Officer Barnes.

775
01:07:44,739 --> 01:07:46,499
I've got 655321

776
01:07:46,769 --> 01:07:50,398
on a transfer from Parkmoor
to the Ludovico Centre, sir.

777
01:07:50,768 --> 01:07:53,328
Good morning.
Yes, we've been expecting you.

778
01:07:53,578 --> 01:07:54,868
I'm Dr. Alcot.

779
01:07:57,178 --> 01:07:58,168
Dr. Alcot.

780
01:07:58,418 --> 01:07:59,748
Very good, sir.

781
01:08:03,547 --> 01:08:06,607
- Are you prepared for the prisoner?
- Yes, of course.

782
01:08:06,887 --> 01:08:10,917
I wonder if you'd mind signing
these documents, sir.

783
01:08:11,757 --> 01:08:13,197
There, sir.

784
01:08:24,636 --> 01:08:26,106
And there, sir.

785
01:08:31,576 --> 01:08:33,105
And there.

786
01:08:52,064 --> 01:08:53,624
There you are.

787
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:57,664
Prison escort, move forward!

788
01:09:00,834 --> 01:09:01,964
Halt!

789
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:05,773
Excuse me, sir.

790
01:09:12,353 --> 01:09:15,583
Is that the officer who will
take charge of the prisoner?

791
01:09:25,132 --> 01:09:28,622
A word of advice, doc.
You'll have to watch this one.

792
01:09:28,932 --> 01:09:32,422
A right brutal bastard he has been,
and will be again

793
01:09:32,672 --> 01:09:35,831
in spite of all his sucking up
and reading the Bible.

794
01:09:36,101 --> 01:09:39,771
We can manage things.
Show the young man to his room.

795
01:09:40,011 --> 01:09:42,771
Right, sir. Come this way, please.

796
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,110
- Morning, Charlie.
- Good morning, Doctor.

797
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,380
Good morning, Alex.

798
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:59,290
My name is Dr. Branom.
I'm Dr. Brodsky's assistant.

799
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:01,120
Good morning, missus.
Lovely day.

800
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,620
Indeed, it is.

801
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:04,490
May I take that?

802
01:10:08,139 --> 01:10:10,629
- How are you feeling?
- Fine, fine.

803
01:10:10,869 --> 01:10:13,859
Good. In a few minutes
you'll meet Dr. Brodsky

804
01:10:14,069 --> 01:10:15,369
and begin your treatment.

805
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:18,499
You're a very lucky boy
to have been chosen.

806
01:10:20,408 --> 01:10:23,008
I realize that,
and I'm very grateful.

807
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:25,378
We're going to be friends,
aren't we?

808
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:27,018
I hope so, missus.

809
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:32,588
What's the hypo for?
Sending me to sleep?

810
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:34,088
Nothing of the sort.

811
01:10:34,558 --> 01:10:37,257
- Vitamins will it be, then?
- Something like that.

812
01:10:37,827 --> 01:10:41,727
You're undernourished, so after
each meal we'll give you a shot.

813
01:10:41,997 --> 01:10:43,437
Roll over on your right side.

814
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:46,537
Loosen your pajama pants
and pull them halfway down.

815
01:10:56,516 --> 01:10:59,506
What exactly is the treatment here
going to be, then?

816
01:11:00,586 --> 01:11:02,416
It's quite simple, really.

817
01:11:03,016 --> 01:11:04,786
We're going to show you some films.

818
01:11:05,056 --> 01:11:07,385
You mean like
going to the pictures?

819
01:11:07,855 --> 01:11:09,445
Something like that.

820
01:11:09,725 --> 01:11:10,555
That's good.

821
01:11:10,795 --> 01:11:13,595
I like to viddy
the old films now and again.

822
01:11:15,635 --> 01:11:18,095
And viddy films I would.

823
01:11:18,605 --> 01:11:20,595
Where I was taken to, brothers

824
01:11:20,805 --> 01:11:22,964
was like no cine
I ever viddied before.

825
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:25,534
I was bound up
in a straitjacket

826
01:11:25,804 --> 01:11:27,964
and my gulliver was strapped
to a headrest

827
01:11:28,244 --> 01:11:30,544
with wires running away from it.

828
01:11:30,774 --> 01:11:33,114
Then they clamped, like,
lid-locks on me eyes

829
01:11:33,314 --> 01:11:36,774
so that I could not shut them,
no matter how hard I tried.

830
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:38,783
It seemed a bit crazy to me

831
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:41,923
but I let them get on with
what they wanted to get on with.

832
01:11:42,153 --> 01:11:45,553
If I was to be a free malchick
again in a fortnight

833
01:11:45,793 --> 01:11:49,233
I would put up with much
in the meantime, O my brothers.

834
01:12:14,681 --> 01:12:18,021
The first film was a very good,
professional piece of cine

835
01:12:18,291 --> 01:12:20,191
like it was done in Hollywood.

836
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,581
The sounds were real horror show.

837
01:12:22,831 --> 01:12:25,990
You could slooshy the screams
and moans very realistic.

838
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,530
You could even get
the breathing and panting

839
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,770
of the tolchocking malchicks
at the same time.

840
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,870
And then what do you know?

841
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,260
Soon our dear old friend

842
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,509
the red, red vino on tap

843
01:12:38,779 --> 01:12:39,939
the same in all places

844
01:12:40,139 --> 01:12:41,609
like it's put out
by the same firm

845
01:12:42,179 --> 01:12:43,809
began to flow.

846
01:12:44,049 --> 01:12:46,169
It was beautiful.

847
01:12:46,549 --> 01:12:48,849
It's funny how the colors
of the real world

848
01:12:49,319 --> 01:12:51,149
only seem really real

849
01:12:51,389 --> 01:12:53,549
when you viddy them
on a screen.

850
01:12:56,528 --> 01:12:58,958
Now, all the time
I was watching this

851
01:12:59,198 --> 01:13:01,458
I was beginning
to get very aware

852
01:13:01,728 --> 01:13:03,888
of, like, not feeling
all that well.

853
01:13:04,128 --> 01:13:08,038
And this I put down
to all the rich food and vitamins.

854
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:12,567
But I tried to forget this,
concentrating on the next film

855
01:13:12,837 --> 01:13:15,507
which jumped right away
on a young devotchka

856
01:13:15,747 --> 01:13:18,577
who was being given
the old in-out, in-out

857
01:13:19,517 --> 01:13:21,577
first by one malchick

858
01:13:22,417 --> 01:13:23,577
then another.

859
01:13:24,646 --> 01:13:26,176
Then another.

860
01:13:29,156 --> 01:13:31,556
When it came to
the 6th or 7th malchick

861
01:13:31,856 --> 01:13:35,316
leering and smecking
and then going into it

862
01:13:35,566 --> 01:13:38,756
I began to feel really sick.

863
01:13:39,366 --> 01:13:41,885
But I could not shut me glazzies.

864
01:13:42,165 --> 01:13:45,565
And even if I tried to move
my glazzballs about

865
01:13:45,835 --> 01:13:47,825
I still could not get out of

866
01:13:48,075 --> 01:13:50,765
the line of fire
of this picture.

867
01:13:53,515 --> 01:13:55,075
Get me up.

868
01:13:55,444 --> 01:13:57,244
I'm going to be sick.

869
01:13:58,254 --> 01:14:00,274
Get something for me to be sick in!

870
01:14:04,584 --> 01:14:07,454
Very soon now,
the drug will cause the subject

871
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:09,924
to experience
a deathlike paralysis

872
01:14:10,194 --> 01:14:14,023
together with deep feelings
of terror and helplessness.

873
01:14:14,903 --> 01:14:18,733
One of our early test subjects
described it as being like death.

874
01:14:18,933 --> 01:14:21,923
A sense of stifling or drowning.

875
01:14:22,643 --> 01:14:25,303
And it is during this period,
we have found

876
01:14:25,573 --> 01:14:29,242
the subject will make
his most rewarding associations

877
01:14:29,442 --> 01:14:33,242
between his catastrophic
experience, environment

878
01:14:33,482 --> 01:14:36,472
and the violence he sees.

879
01:14:38,292 --> 01:14:40,282
Dr. Brodsky is pleased with you.

880
01:14:40,592 --> 01:14:42,951
You've made
a very positive response.

881
01:14:44,061 --> 01:14:47,961
Tomorrow there will be two
sessions, morning and afternoon.

882
01:14:48,161 --> 01:14:51,221
You mean I have to viddy
two sessions in one day?

883
01:14:51,431 --> 01:14:54,591
I imagine you'll feel a bit
limp by the end of the day.

884
01:14:54,831 --> 01:14:58,170
But we have to be hard on you.
You have to be cured.

885
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:59,500
It was horrible.

886
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:01,300
Of course it was horrible.

887
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,980
Violence is a very horrible thing.

888
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,940
That's what you're learning now.

889
01:15:06,180 --> 01:15:07,440
Your body's learning it.

890
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,810
I just don't understand about
feeling sick the way I did.

891
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:14,319
I never used to feel sick.
I used to feel the very opposite.

892
01:15:14,589 --> 01:15:17,489
Doing it or watching it,
I used to feel real horror show.

893
01:15:18,359 --> 01:15:21,849
You felt ill this afternoon
because you're getting better.

894
01:15:22,129 --> 01:15:25,289
When we're healthy,
we respond to the hateful

895
01:15:25,529 --> 01:15:27,518
with fear and nausea.

896
01:15:27,768 --> 01:15:29,958
You're becoming healthy,
that's all.

897
01:15:30,198 --> 01:15:32,068
By this time tomorrow,
you'll be healthier still.

898
01:16:26,035 --> 01:16:28,065
It was the next day, brothers

899
01:16:28,275 --> 01:16:29,834
and I had truly done my best

900
01:16:30,104 --> 01:16:32,504
morning and afternoon
to play it their way

901
01:16:32,774 --> 01:16:35,574
and sit like a horror show
cooperative malchick

902
01:16:35,784 --> 01:16:37,334
in the chair of torture

903
01:16:37,584 --> 01:16:41,784
while they flashed nasty bits
of ultra-violence on the screen

904
01:16:42,254 --> 01:16:46,743
though not on the soundtrack,
the only sound being music.

905
01:16:47,723 --> 01:16:50,283
Then I noticed,
in all my pain and sickness

906
01:16:50,563 --> 01:16:54,463
what music it was
that, like, cracked and boomed.

907
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:57,893
It was Ludwig van.

908
01:16:58,433 --> 01:17:00,962
Ninth Symphony, fourth movement.

909
01:17:16,651 --> 01:17:19,711
Stop it! Stop it!
Please, I beg you!

910
01:17:20,251 --> 01:17:21,451
It's a sin!

911
01:17:21,821 --> 01:17:23,451
It's a sin!

912
01:17:28,931 --> 01:17:29,991
Sin?

913
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:31,820
What's all this about sin?

914
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:33,230
That!

915
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:37,460
Using Ludwig van like that.
He did no harm to anyone.

916
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:40,170
Beethoven just wrote music.

917
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:44,010
Are you referring
to the background score?

918
01:17:45,579 --> 01:17:47,509
You've heard Beethoven before?

919
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,619
So you're keen on music?

920
01:17:56,959 --> 01:17:58,759
Can't be helped.

921
01:17:59,489 --> 01:18:02,288
Here's the punishment
element perhaps.

922
01:18:03,298 --> 01:18:05,418
The governor ought to be pleased.

923
01:18:08,198 --> 01:18:10,138
I'm sorry, Alex.

924
01:18:10,438 --> 01:18:12,128
This is for your own good.

925
01:18:12,368 --> 01:18:14,768
You'll have to bear with us
for a while.

926
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:19,267
But it's not fair.
It's not fair I should feel ill

927
01:18:19,507 --> 01:18:22,447
when I hear lovely,
lovely Ludwig van.

928
01:18:22,977 --> 01:18:25,317
You must take your chance, boy.

929
01:18:25,787 --> 01:18:28,277
The choice has been all yours.

930
01:18:29,787 --> 01:18:32,516
You needn't take it
any further, sir.

931
01:18:32,856 --> 01:18:35,796
You've proved to me all this
ultra-violence and killing

932
01:18:36,056 --> 01:18:39,286
is wrong, wrong
and terribly wrong!

933
01:18:39,696 --> 01:18:41,496
I've learned me lesson, sir.

934
01:18:41,736 --> 01:18:44,636
I see now what I've
never seen before.

935
01:18:44,866 --> 01:18:47,835
I'm cured. Praise God!

936
01:18:48,135 --> 01:18:50,535
You're not cured yet, boy.

937
01:18:51,405 --> 01:18:52,875
But, sirs.

938
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:54,475
Missus!

939
01:18:54,815 --> 01:18:56,905
I see that it's wrong!

940
01:18:57,175 --> 01:19:01,205
It's wrong because
it's, like, against society.

941
01:19:01,515 --> 01:19:04,144
Because everybody has the
right to live and be happy

942
01:19:04,384 --> 01:19:07,184
without being
tolchocked and knifed!

943
01:19:07,494 --> 01:19:10,514
No, no, boy.
You really must leave it to us.

944
01:19:10,824 --> 01:19:12,414
But be cheerful about it.

945
01:19:12,724 --> 01:19:15,994
In less than a fortnight now,
you'll be a free man.

946
01:19:54,401 --> 01:19:55,631
Ladies and gentlemen

947
01:19:55,871 --> 01:19:58,771
at this stage, we introduce
the subject himself.

948
01:19:58,971 --> 01:20:01,941
He is, as you will perceive,
fit and well-nourished.

949
01:20:02,211 --> 01:20:05,070
He comes straight from a night's
sleep and a good breakfast

950
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,270
undrugged

951
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,380
unhypnotized.

952
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:12,310
Tomorrow we send him out with
confidence into the world again

953
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:16,210
as decent a lad as you
would meet on a May morning.

954
01:20:16,990 --> 01:20:19,749
What a change is here,
ladies and gentlemen.

955
01:20:19,989 --> 01:20:22,389
From the hoodlum
the state committed

956
01:20:22,589 --> 01:20:25,389
to unprofitable punishment
two years ago.

957
01:20:25,599 --> 01:20:28,389
Unchanged after two years.

958
01:20:29,129 --> 01:20:31,329
Unchanged, do I say?

959
01:20:31,599 --> 01:20:33,069
Not quite.

960
01:20:33,299 --> 01:20:37,998
Prison taught him the false smile,
the rubbed hands of hypocrisy.

961
01:20:38,308 --> 01:20:41,608
The fawning, greased,
obsequious leer.

962
01:20:42,078 --> 01:20:43,938
Other vices it taught him

963
01:20:44,178 --> 01:20:48,078
as well as confirming him in
those he had long practiced before.

964
01:20:49,288 --> 01:20:52,307
Our party promised
to restore law and order

965
01:20:52,587 --> 01:20:56,617
and to make the streets safe for
the ordinary peace-loving citizen.

966
01:20:56,927 --> 01:21:00,917
This pledge is now
about to become a reality.

967
01:21:01,167 --> 01:21:04,856
Ladies and gentlemen,
today is an historic moment.

968
01:21:05,136 --> 01:21:09,656
The problem of criminal violence
is soon to be a thing of the past.

969
01:21:10,636 --> 01:21:12,536
But enough of words.

970
01:21:12,836 --> 01:21:15,036
Actions speak louder than.

971
01:21:15,306 --> 01:21:17,006
Action now.

972
01:21:17,476 --> 01:21:19,446
Observe all.

973
01:21:29,055 --> 01:21:31,645
Our necks are out
a long way on this, Minister.

974
01:21:31,855 --> 01:21:33,985
I have complete faith in Brodsky.

975
01:21:34,225 --> 01:21:37,384
If the polls are right,
we have nothing to lose.

976
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:48,874
Hello, heap of dirt.

977
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:55,973
You don't wash much, do you,
judging by the horrible smell.

978
01:21:56,543 --> 01:21:58,983
Why do you say that?
I had a shower this morning.

979
01:21:59,213 --> 01:22:01,883
He had a shower this morning.

980
01:22:02,353 --> 01:22:04,413
You trying to call me a liar?

981
01:22:04,693 --> 01:22:05,523
No, brother.

982
01:22:05,893 --> 01:22:09,012
You must think I'm awfully stupid.

983
01:22:14,662 --> 01:22:16,492
Why did you do that, brother?

984
01:22:16,702 --> 01:22:18,672
I've never done wrong to you.

985
01:22:18,902 --> 01:22:20,992
You want to know why I did that?

986
01:22:21,402 --> 01:22:22,431
Well, you see

987
01:22:22,701 --> 01:22:23,931
I do this

988
01:22:24,211 --> 01:22:25,401
and that

989
01:22:25,711 --> 01:22:28,901
and this because I don't like
your horrible type, do I?

990
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:31,441
And if you want
to start something

991
01:22:31,711 --> 01:22:34,241
you just go ahead.
Go on!

992
01:22:34,451 --> 01:22:35,681
Please do!

993
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:39,110
I'm going to be sick.

994
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:41,620
You're going to be sick, are you?

995
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:44,290
I'm going to be sick.
Please let me get up.

996
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:46,620
You want to get up?

997
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:48,720
Well, now you listen to me.

998
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:51,020
If you want to get up

999
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:53,469
you've got to
do something for me.

1000
01:22:54,199 --> 01:22:55,359
Here.

1001
01:22:55,869 --> 01:22:57,029
Here.

1002
01:22:57,709 --> 01:22:59,369
You see that?

1003
01:23:00,369 --> 01:23:01,809
You see that shoe?

1004
01:23:03,209 --> 01:23:04,609
I want you to lick it.

1005
01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:06,139
Go on!

1006
01:23:07,209 --> 01:23:08,698
Lick it!

1007
01:23:11,788 --> 01:23:14,118
And, O my brothers,
would you believe

1008
01:23:14,388 --> 01:23:17,718
your faithful friend
and long-suffering narrator

1009
01:23:17,958 --> 01:23:20,318
pushed out his red yabzick
a mile and a half

1010
01:23:20,588 --> 01:23:23,427
to lick the grahzny,
vonny boots.

1011
01:23:24,227 --> 01:23:25,257
And again!

1012
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:27,927
The horrible killing sickness
had whooshed up

1013
01:23:28,167 --> 01:23:29,797
and turned the joy of battle

1014
01:23:30,597 --> 01:23:33,227
into a feeling
I was going to snuff it.

1015
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:34,767
And again.

1016
01:23:35,277 --> 01:23:37,267
Nice and clean.

1017
01:23:39,946 --> 01:23:41,066
Thank you very much.

1018
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:43,146
That will do very well.

1019
01:23:47,346 --> 01:23:49,646
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

1020
01:25:00,151 --> 01:25:01,811
She came towards me

1021
01:25:02,051 --> 01:25:05,821
with the light, like it was the
light light of heavenly grace.

1022
01:25:06,061 --> 01:25:08,251
And the thing that flashed
in me gulliver

1023
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:11,150
was that I'd like to have her
there on the floor

1024
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:14,660
with the old in-out,
real savage.

1025
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:33,109
But quick as a shot
came the sickness.

1026
01:25:33,379 --> 01:25:35,879
Like a detective who'd been
watching around the corner

1027
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:39,419
and now followed
to make his arrest.

1028
01:25:52,538 --> 01:25:53,398
Enough!

1029
01:25:53,738 --> 01:25:55,398
Thank you very much.

1030
01:25:55,608 --> 01:25:57,397
Thank you, my dear.

1031
01:26:19,256 --> 01:26:21,886
Not feeling too bad now, are you?

1032
01:26:22,296 --> 01:26:24,596
No, sir.
I feel really great, sir.

1033
01:26:24,796 --> 01:26:26,766
- Good.
- Was it all right, sir?

1034
01:26:26,966 --> 01:26:27,795
Did I do well?

1035
01:26:28,065 --> 01:26:31,405
Fine, my boy.
Absolutely fine.

1036
01:26:31,635 --> 01:26:32,895
You see, ladies and gentlemen

1037
01:26:33,135 --> 01:26:35,605
our subject is impelled
towards the good

1038
01:26:35,905 --> 01:26:39,505
by paradoxically
being impelled towards evil.

1039
01:26:39,815 --> 01:26:41,475
The intention to act violently

1040
01:26:41,745 --> 01:26:45,144
is accompanied by strong
feelings of physical distress.

1041
01:26:45,414 --> 01:26:48,074
To counter these,
the subject has to switch

1042
01:26:48,324 --> 01:26:51,284
to a diametrically
opposed attitude.

1043
01:26:51,954 --> 01:26:53,324
Any questions?

1044
01:26:53,594 --> 01:26:54,994
Choice!

1045
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:01,993
The boy has no real choice, has he?

1046
01:27:02,203 --> 01:27:03,753
Self-interest.

1047
01:27:04,033 --> 01:27:05,863
The fear of physical pain

1048
01:27:06,133 --> 01:27:10,663
drove him to that
grotesque act of self-abasement.

1049
01:27:11,443 --> 01:27:13,502
Its insincerity
was clearly to be seen.

1050
01:27:13,712 --> 01:27:15,612
He ceases to be a wrongdoer.

1051
01:27:15,842 --> 01:27:20,442
He ceases also to be
a creature capable of moral choice.

1052
01:27:20,712 --> 01:27:23,012
Padre, these are subtleties.

1053
01:27:23,282 --> 01:27:26,382
We're not concerned with motives,
with the higher ethics.

1054
01:27:26,652 --> 01:27:30,351
We are concerned only
with cutting down crime.

1055
01:27:32,661 --> 01:27:37,291
And with relieving the ghastly
congestion in our prisons.

1056
01:27:37,831 --> 01:27:40,301
He will be your true Christian

1057
01:27:40,571 --> 01:27:42,661
ready to turn the other cheek.

1058
01:27:42,871 --> 01:27:45,900
Ready to be crucified,
rather than crucify.

1059
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:50,240
Sick to the very heart at the
thought even of killing a fly.

1060
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:51,880
Reclamation.

1061
01:27:52,150 --> 01:27:54,340
Joy before the angels of God.

1062
01:27:54,580 --> 01:27:57,710
The point is that it works!

1063
01:28:02,089 --> 01:28:05,419
And the very next day,
your friend and humble narrator

1064
01:28:05,689 --> 01:28:07,719
was a free man.

1065
01:28:46,126 --> 01:28:47,566
Son!

1066
01:28:49,136 --> 01:28:51,466
Hi, hi, hi there, my Pee and Em.

1067
01:28:52,766 --> 01:28:54,036
Mum.

1068
01:28:55,806 --> 01:28:58,206
How are you, love?
Nice to see you.

1069
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:02,205
- Dad.
- Lad. What a surprise.

1070
01:29:02,445 --> 01:29:04,535
- Good to see you.
- Keeping fit?

1071
01:29:05,285 --> 01:29:06,545
How are you, then?

1072
01:29:06,785 --> 01:29:08,905
I'm fine, fine.

1073
01:29:09,155 --> 01:29:11,115
Keeping out of trouble, you know.

1074
01:29:13,885 --> 01:29:15,615
I'm back!

1075
01:29:18,324 --> 01:29:19,314
Good to see you.

1076
01:29:19,594 --> 01:29:22,754
Why didn't you let us know
what was happening?

1077
01:29:23,094 --> 01:29:26,224
I wanted it to be, like,
a big surprise for you and Pee.

1078
01:29:26,504 --> 01:29:29,404
It's a surprise, all right.
A bit bewildering too.

1079
01:29:29,634 --> 01:29:32,473
We've only just read about it
in morning papers.

1080
01:29:32,743 --> 01:29:34,503
You should have let us know, lad.

1081
01:29:35,173 --> 01:29:39,113
Not that we're not very pleased
to see you again, and all

1082
01:29:39,413 --> 01:29:40,843
cured too, eh?

1083
01:29:41,113 --> 01:29:43,173
That's right.
They did a great job on me.

1084
01:29:43,483 --> 01:29:46,073
I'm completely reformed.

1085
01:29:49,792 --> 01:29:51,482
Still the same old place, then?

1086
01:30:04,001 --> 01:30:06,831
There's a strange fellow
sitting on the sofa

1087
01:30:07,101 --> 01:30:10,201
munchy-wunching
lomticks of toast.

1088
01:30:13,211 --> 01:30:15,011
That's Joe.

1089
01:30:16,951 --> 01:30:18,850
He lives here now.

1090
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:20,480
The lodger.

1091
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,340
That's what he is.

1092
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,710
He rents your room.

1093
01:30:35,399 --> 01:30:36,889
How do you do, Joe?

1094
01:30:37,129 --> 01:30:39,159
Find the room comfortable, do you?

1095
01:30:39,399 --> 01:30:41,369
No complaints?

1096
01:30:44,469 --> 01:30:46,339
I've heard about you.

1097
01:30:47,409 --> 01:30:49,138
I know what you've done.

1098
01:30:53,518 --> 01:30:57,148
Breaking the hearts of your
poor, grieving parents.

1099
01:30:58,158 --> 01:30:59,878
So you're back, eh?

1100
01:31:00,158 --> 01:31:04,817
Back to make life a misery for
your lovely parents once more?

1101
01:31:05,097 --> 01:31:06,557
Over my dead corpse, you will.

1102
01:31:06,857 --> 01:31:10,157
Because, you see, they've let me
be more like a son to them

1103
01:31:10,367 --> 01:31:12,357
than like a lodger.

1104
01:31:13,937 --> 01:31:16,497
Don't go fighting here, boys.

1105
01:31:22,376 --> 01:31:24,206
Do put your hand
over your mouth, please.

1106
01:31:24,506 --> 01:31:25,706
It's bloody revolting.

1107
01:31:31,246 --> 01:31:32,846
Are you all right?

1108
01:31:34,015 --> 01:31:35,685
It's the treatment.

1109
01:31:35,925 --> 01:31:38,545
It's disgusting.
Enough to put you off your food.

1110
01:31:38,795 --> 01:31:42,595
Leave him be, Joe.
It's the treatment.

1111
01:31:44,695 --> 01:31:47,525
Do you think we ought
to do something?

1112
01:31:48,565 --> 01:31:51,904
Would you like me to make you
a nice cup of tea, son?

1113
01:32:02,644 --> 01:32:05,743
What have you done
with all me own personal things?

1114
01:32:10,053 --> 01:32:12,813
That was all

1115
01:32:13,053 --> 01:32:14,713
took away, son.

1116
01:32:15,293 --> 01:32:17,093
By the police.

1117
01:32:17,493 --> 01:32:19,433
New regulation, see

1118
01:32:19,663 --> 01:32:22,722
about compensation
for the victims.

1119
01:32:25,402 --> 01:32:27,062
What about Basil?

1120
01:32:30,072 --> 01:32:31,802
Where is my snake?

1121
01:32:42,081 --> 01:32:43,281
He met with

1122
01:32:43,521 --> 01:32:45,311
like, an accident.

1123
01:32:49,291 --> 01:32:50,760
He passed away.

1124
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:58,190
What's going to happen to me, then?

1125
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:01,700
I mean

1126
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:04,270
that's my room he's in.

1127
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,369
There's no denying that.

1128
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:09,999
This is my home also.

1129
01:33:11,949 --> 01:33:15,379
What suggestions have you,
my Pee and Em, to make?

1130
01:33:21,318 --> 01:33:23,878
All this needs thinking about, son.

1131
01:33:25,158 --> 01:33:27,988
We can't very well
just kick Joe out.

1132
01:33:28,228 --> 01:33:30,028
Not just like that, can we?

1133
01:33:30,328 --> 01:33:31,348
I mean

1134
01:33:31,628 --> 01:33:33,568
Joe's here doing a job.

1135
01:33:33,828 --> 01:33:36,128
A contract it is.
Two years.

1136
01:33:36,368 --> 01:33:40,067
We made, like, an arrangement.
Didn't we, Joe?

1137
01:33:41,837 --> 01:33:43,807
You see, son

1138
01:33:45,147 --> 01:33:48,667
Joe's paid next month's
rent already

1139
01:33:50,217 --> 01:33:53,046
so whatever we may do in
the future, we can't just say

1140
01:33:53,316 --> 01:33:56,306
to Joe to get out, now can we?

1141
01:33:56,716 --> 01:33:58,586
No, but it's much more than that.

1142
01:33:59,486 --> 01:34:01,886
I mean, I've got you two
to think of

1143
01:34:02,156 --> 01:34:05,026
who've been like
a father and mother to me.

1144
01:34:05,266 --> 01:34:08,255
It wouldn't be right for me
to go off and leave you two

1145
01:34:08,535 --> 01:34:11,395
to the tender mercies
of this young monster

1146
01:34:11,705 --> 01:34:14,895
who's been like
no real son at all.

1147
01:34:15,575 --> 01:34:17,905
Look, he's weeping now.

1148
01:34:18,105 --> 01:34:21,095
But that's all his craft
and artfulness.

1149
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:24,174
Let him go and find
a room somewhere else.

1150
01:34:24,414 --> 01:34:28,714
Let him learn the errors
of his way, and that a bad boy

1151
01:34:28,954 --> 01:34:32,444
doesn't deserve such a good
mum and dad as he's had.

1152
01:34:38,123 --> 01:34:39,423
All right.

1153
01:34:40,523 --> 01:34:42,393
I know how things are now.

1154
01:34:43,893 --> 01:34:46,453
I've suffered and I've suffered

1155
01:34:46,733 --> 01:34:48,703
and I've suffered.

1156
01:34:49,403 --> 01:34:52,603
And everybody wants me
to go on suffering.

1157
01:34:54,572 --> 01:34:56,732
You've made others suffer.

1158
01:34:57,242 --> 01:35:00,402
It's only right
that you should suffer proper.

1159
01:35:01,312 --> 01:35:02,972
I've been told
everything you've done

1160
01:35:03,252 --> 01:35:05,212
sitting around the family table.

1161
01:35:05,452 --> 01:35:08,542
And pretty shocking
it was to listen to.

1162
01:35:09,451 --> 01:35:12,621
It made me real sick,
a lot of it did.

1163
01:35:14,591 --> 01:35:18,151
Now look what you've gone
and done to your mother.

1164
01:35:18,461 --> 01:35:20,051
Come on. It's all right now.

1165
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:34,140
Right!

1166
01:35:34,910 --> 01:35:36,610
I'm leaving now.

1167
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:39,010
You won't ever viddy me no more.

1168
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,979
I'll make me own way.

1169
01:35:41,449 --> 01:35:45,079
Thank you very much. Let it lie
heavy on your consciences.

1170
01:35:46,459 --> 01:35:49,359
Now don't take it like that, son.

1171
01:36:51,655 --> 01:36:54,585
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1172
01:36:56,424 --> 01:36:59,514
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1173
01:37:03,194 --> 01:37:06,254
Can you spare some cutter,
me brother?

1174
01:37:27,582 --> 01:37:29,052
Thanks, brother.

1175
01:37:46,971 --> 01:37:48,801
Jamey Mack!

1176
01:37:49,271 --> 01:37:50,741
May the hokey fly!

1177
01:37:51,071 --> 01:37:54,631
Mother of God and all the blessed
saints in heaven preserve us!

1178
01:37:56,311 --> 01:37:58,400
I never forget a face, me God!

1179
01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:00,040
I never forget any face.

1180
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:03,040
Leave me alone, brother.
I've never seen you before!

1181
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:06,740
This is the poisonous young swine
that near done me in.

1182
01:38:06,990 --> 01:38:08,150
Him and his friends.

1183
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:11,320
They beat me and kicked me
and punched me.

1184
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:13,079
Stop him! Stop him!

1185
01:38:13,329 --> 01:38:17,259
They laughed at me blood
and me moans, this murderous dog!

1186
01:38:17,499 --> 01:38:20,929
Then there was like
a sea of dirty, smelly old men

1187
01:38:21,129 --> 01:38:23,229
trying to get at
your humble narrator

1188
01:38:23,469 --> 01:38:27,169
with their feeble rookers
and horny old claws.

1189
01:38:27,409 --> 01:38:30,168
It was old age
having a go at youth.

1190
01:38:30,908 --> 01:38:34,138
And I daren't do a single
solitary thing, O my brothers.

1191
01:38:34,478 --> 01:38:36,468
It being better
to be hit at like that

1192
01:38:36,678 --> 01:38:39,278
than want to sick
and feel that horrible pain.

1193
01:38:39,518 --> 01:38:40,948
All right, all right!

1194
01:38:41,188 --> 01:38:42,088
Stop it now!

1195
01:38:42,318 --> 01:38:45,687
Come on. Stop breaking the
state's peace, you naughty boys!

1196
01:38:45,987 --> 01:38:48,787
Back away! Go away with you!

1197
01:38:49,027 --> 01:38:51,327
What's your trouble, sir?

1198
01:38:58,966 --> 01:39:00,336
Well!

1199
01:39:01,006 --> 01:39:03,476
Well, well, well!

1200
01:39:07,376 --> 01:39:09,936
If it isn't little Alex.

1201
01:39:10,146 --> 01:39:11,516
Long time no viddy, droog.

1202
01:39:11,786 --> 01:39:13,216
How goes?

1203
01:39:13,486 --> 01:39:14,705
It's impossible.

1204
01:39:14,985 --> 01:39:16,215
I don't believe it.

1205
01:39:16,455 --> 01:39:18,315
Evidence of the old glazzies.

1206
01:39:18,555 --> 01:39:20,355
Nothing up our sleeves.

1207
01:39:20,625 --> 01:39:22,645
No magic, little Alex.

1208
01:39:22,895 --> 01:39:26,345
A job for two
who are now of job age.

1209
01:39:26,725 --> 01:39:28,165
The police.

1210
01:39:43,914 --> 01:39:45,073
Come on, Alex.

1211
01:39:45,383 --> 01:39:46,873
Come for walking.

1212
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:00,922
Come, come, come,
my little droogies.

1213
01:40:01,162 --> 01:40:02,682
I just don't get this at all.

1214
01:40:02,932 --> 01:40:05,092
The old days are dead and gone.

1215
01:40:05,362 --> 01:40:08,232
For what I did in the past,
I've been punished.

1216
01:40:08,502 --> 01:40:10,162
I've been cured.

1217
01:40:10,402 --> 01:40:11,592
That was read out to us.

1218
01:40:11,872 --> 01:40:13,702
The inspector read it
all out to us.

1219
01:40:13,942 --> 01:40:16,671
He said it was a very good way.

1220
01:40:16,871 --> 01:40:18,101
But what is all this?

1221
01:40:18,411 --> 01:40:20,901
It was them
that went for me, brothers.

1222
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:23,841
You're not on their side,
and can't be.

1223
01:40:24,411 --> 01:40:26,581
You can't be, Dim.

1224
01:40:26,851 --> 01:40:29,511
It was someone we fillied with
back in the old days

1225
01:40:29,751 --> 01:40:33,240
trying to get his own revenge
after all this time. Remember?

1226
01:40:33,460 --> 01:40:34,890
A long time is right.

1227
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:37,420
I don't remember them days
too horror show.

1228
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:39,720
And don't call me Dim
no more, either.

1229
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:42,060
Officer, call me.

1230
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:45,860
Enough is remembered, though,
little Alex.

1231
01:40:46,469 --> 01:40:49,559
And this is to make sure
you stay cured.

1232
01:41:45,496 --> 01:41:46,616
That's enough.

1233
01:41:46,856 --> 01:41:49,485
A bit more. He's still kicking.

1234
01:42:08,344 --> 01:42:10,214
Cured, are you?

1235
01:42:11,844 --> 01:42:15,684
Be viddying you some more
sometime, droogie.

1236
01:42:31,003 --> 01:42:34,962
Where was I to go,
who had no home and no money?

1237
01:42:35,202 --> 01:42:37,472
I cried for meself.

1238
01:42:37,742 --> 01:42:40,542
Home, home, home.

1239
01:42:40,812 --> 01:42:42,642
It was home I was wanting.

1240
01:42:42,912 --> 01:42:45,902
And it was home
I came to, brothers

1241
01:42:46,182 --> 01:42:48,842
not realizing,
in the state I was in

1242
01:42:49,051 --> 01:42:52,041
where I was
and had been before.

1243
01:43:40,268 --> 01:43:42,258
Who on earth could that be?

1244
01:43:57,817 --> 01:43:59,547
I'll see who it is.

1245
01:44:11,096 --> 01:44:12,616
Yes, what is it?

1246
01:44:21,305 --> 01:44:22,495
Please.

1247
01:44:39,354 --> 01:44:42,684
Frank, I think this young man
needs some help.

1248
01:44:47,424 --> 01:44:48,824
My God!

1249
01:44:49,834 --> 01:44:52,023
What's happened to you, my boy?

1250
01:44:54,503 --> 01:44:58,193
And would you believe it,
O my brothers and only friends

1251
01:44:58,433 --> 01:45:00,663
there was your
faithful narrator

1252
01:45:00,973 --> 01:45:03,373
being held helpless
like a babe in arms

1253
01:45:03,643 --> 01:45:06,013
and suddenly realizing
where he was

1254
01:45:06,313 --> 01:45:09,682
and why "home" on the gate
had looked so familiar.

1255
01:45:09,952 --> 01:45:11,712
But I knew I was safe.

1256
01:45:11,952 --> 01:45:13,972
I knew he would not remember me.

1257
01:45:14,222 --> 01:45:15,982
For in those carefree days

1258
01:45:16,222 --> 01:45:18,122
I and my so-called droogs

1259
01:45:18,352 --> 01:45:21,852
wore our maskies, which were
like real horror show disguises.

1260
01:45:23,191 --> 01:45:24,351
Police.

1261
01:45:28,031 --> 01:45:30,231
Ghastly, horrible police

1262
01:45:32,241 --> 01:45:33,791
they beat me up, sir.

1263
01:45:38,070 --> 01:45:40,470
The police beat me up.

1264
01:45:42,550 --> 01:45:44,210
I know you!

1265
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:50,540
Isn't it your picture
in the newspapers?

1266
01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:53,020
Didn't I see you
on the video this morning?

1267
01:45:53,259 --> 01:45:56,589
Are you not the poor victim
of this horrible new technique?

1268
01:45:56,889 --> 01:45:58,159
Yes, sir.

1269
01:45:58,659 --> 01:46:01,819
That's exactly who I am and
what I am, sir. A victim.

1270
01:46:02,059 --> 01:46:05,189
Then, by God, you've been
sent here by providence!

1271
01:46:05,429 --> 01:46:08,528
Tortured in prison, then
tortured by the police.

1272
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:13,268
My heart goes out to you.
You're not the first to come here.

1273
01:46:13,538 --> 01:46:16,408
The police like to bring
their victims to this village.

1274
01:46:16,678 --> 01:46:18,038
But it's providential that you

1275
01:46:18,348 --> 01:46:21,838
who are also another kind
of victim, should come here.

1276
01:46:23,788 --> 01:46:26,777
But you're cold and shivering.

1277
01:46:27,357 --> 01:46:28,717
Julian

1278
01:46:28,957 --> 01:46:31,217
draw a bath for this young man.

1279
01:46:31,457 --> 01:46:32,787
Certainly, Frank.

1280
01:46:33,197 --> 01:46:34,787
Thank you very much.

1281
01:46:35,097 --> 01:46:36,687
God bless you.

1282
01:47:31,613 --> 01:47:33,913
He can be the most potent
weapon imaginable

1283
01:47:34,153 --> 01:47:37,313
to ensure the government
is not returned in the election.

1284
01:47:37,583 --> 01:47:39,353
The government's big boast, sir

1285
01:47:39,653 --> 01:47:42,312
is the way they have
dealt with crime:

1286
01:47:42,592 --> 01:47:44,422
Recruiting young roughs
into the police

1287
01:47:44,662 --> 01:47:47,752
proposing will-sapping
techniques of conditioning.

1288
01:47:47,992 --> 01:47:50,192
We've seen it before
in other countries.

1289
01:47:50,462 --> 01:47:51,932
The thin end of the wedge.

1290
01:47:52,162 --> 01:47:56,261
Before we know it, we'll have the
full apparatus of totalitarianism.

1291
01:48:00,341 --> 01:48:04,711
This young boy is a living witness
to these diabolical proposals.

1292
01:48:04,941 --> 01:48:08,681
The people, the common people,
must know, must see.

1293
01:48:08,951 --> 01:48:13,320
There are traditions of liberty to
defend. That tradition is all.

1294
01:48:13,550 --> 01:48:15,520
The common people
will let it go, yes.

1295
01:48:15,790 --> 01:48:17,880
They'll sell liberty
for a quieter life.

1296
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:19,680
That is why they must be led.

1297
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:22,020
Driven. Pushed.

1298
01:48:27,069 --> 01:48:28,359
Fine.

1299
01:48:29,369 --> 01:48:31,029
Thank you very much, sir.

1300
01:48:33,069 --> 01:48:34,629
He'll be here.

1301
01:48:37,879 --> 01:48:41,179
I'm singing in the rain

1302
01:48:41,908 --> 01:48:44,878
Just singing in the rain

1303
01:48:45,718 --> 01:48:48,878
What a glorious feeling

1304
01:48:49,258 --> 01:48:52,658
I'm hap-hap-happy again

1305
01:48:53,228 --> 01:48:56,348
I'm laughing at clouds

1306
01:48:57,158 --> 01:48:59,717
So dark up above

1307
01:49:00,697 --> 01:49:03,187
The sun's in my heart

1308
01:49:03,997 --> 01:49:07,937
I'm ready for love

1309
01:49:08,867 --> 01:49:11,597
Let the stormy clouds chase

1310
01:49:12,237 --> 01:49:15,076
Everyone from the place

1311
01:49:16,576 --> 01:49:21,536
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face

1312
01:49:22,186 --> 01:49:25,176
I'll walk down the lane

1313
01:49:59,423 --> 01:50:00,813
Good evening, sir.

1314
01:50:04,793 --> 01:50:06,313
Good evening.

1315
01:50:06,893 --> 01:50:09,723
It was very kind of you
to leave this out for me.

1316
01:50:09,963 --> 01:50:12,393
There was no one around,
so I started.

1317
01:50:12,633 --> 01:50:14,462
Hope that's all right, sir.

1318
01:50:18,002 --> 01:50:19,662
Of course.

1319
01:50:50,600 --> 01:50:52,930
Food all right?

1320
01:50:58,670 --> 01:51:00,339
Great, sir. Great.

1321
01:51:03,309 --> 01:51:05,539
Try the wine.

1322
01:51:11,949 --> 01:51:13,289
Thank you, sir.

1323
01:51:15,888 --> 01:51:17,148
Cheers.

1324
01:51:19,198 --> 01:51:20,388
Happy days.

1325
01:51:30,907 --> 01:51:33,237
Won't you join me?

1326
01:51:33,977 --> 01:51:36,167
My health doesn't allow it.

1327
01:51:37,007 --> 01:51:38,337
No, thank you.

1328
01:51:44,317 --> 01:51:46,806
"1960, Chateau

1329
01:51:47,316 --> 01:51:49,216
Saint-Estephe.

1330
01:51:49,486 --> 01:51:50,316
Medoc"

1331
01:51:50,556 --> 01:51:51,526
Very good brand.

1332
01:52:00,236 --> 01:52:01,256
Very good

1333
01:52:01,535 --> 01:52:02,725
color, sir.

1334
01:52:06,935 --> 01:52:08,705
Smells nice too.

1335
01:52:23,584 --> 01:52:25,614
Very nice little number.

1336
01:52:26,854 --> 01:52:28,184
Here's to it.

1337
01:52:36,933 --> 01:52:39,423
Very refreshing, sir.
Very refreshing.

1338
01:52:39,703 --> 01:52:42,603
I'm pleased you
appreciate good wine.

1339
01:52:43,743 --> 01:52:45,603
Have another glass.

1340
01:52:58,782 --> 01:53:00,122
My wife

1341
01:53:01,592 --> 01:53:05,111
used to do everything for me
and leave me to my writing.

1342
01:53:08,061 --> 01:53:09,651
Your wife? Is she away?

1343
01:53:10,101 --> 01:53:12,431
She's dead!

1344
01:53:16,501 --> 01:53:18,330
I'm sorry to hear about that.

1345
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:20,970
She was very badly raped, you see.

1346
01:53:21,240 --> 01:53:23,640
We were assaulted by
vicious young hoodlums

1347
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:26,240
in this very room
you're sitting in now.

1348
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:31,180
I was left a helpless cripple,
but for her the agony was too great.

1349
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:33,420
The doctors said
it was pneumonia

1350
01:53:33,649 --> 01:53:36,489
because it happened later,
during a flu epidemic.

1351
01:53:36,759 --> 01:53:40,989
The doctors told me it was
pneumonia, but I knew what it was.

1352
01:53:41,259 --> 01:53:45,629
A victim of the modern age.
Poor, poor girl!

1353
01:53:49,598 --> 01:53:51,158
And now you.

1354
01:53:51,768 --> 01:53:54,828
Another victim of the modern age.

1355
01:53:55,138 --> 01:53:57,038
But you can be helped.

1356
01:53:58,108 --> 01:54:01,508
I phoned some friends while
you were having your bath.

1357
01:54:01,778 --> 01:54:02,608
Some

1358
01:54:02,848 --> 01:54:03,938
friends?

1359
01:54:04,177 --> 01:54:05,707
They want to help you.

1360
01:54:05,987 --> 01:54:08,217
- Help me?
- Help you.

1361
01:54:08,487 --> 01:54:11,977
- Who are they?
- Very, very important people.

1362
01:54:12,217 --> 01:54:14,617
And they're interested in you.

1363
01:54:20,126 --> 01:54:22,286
This'll be these people now.

1364
01:54:22,496 --> 01:54:25,896
I don't want to trouble you
any further. I should be leaving.

1365
01:54:27,006 --> 01:54:28,966
No trouble at all.

1366
01:54:29,676 --> 01:54:30,866
Here.

1367
01:54:31,106 --> 01:54:33,006
Let me fill your glass.

1368
01:54:58,734 --> 01:55:00,464
So this is the young man.

1369
01:55:01,864 --> 01:55:03,304
How do you do, sir?

1370
01:55:03,674 --> 01:55:06,293
Missus.
I'm very pleased to meet you.

1371
01:55:06,703 --> 01:55:09,173
I hope you forgive us for coming
at this hour

1372
01:55:09,413 --> 01:55:11,243
but we heard you
were in trouble

1373
01:55:11,543 --> 01:55:13,803
and so we came over to see
if we could help.

1374
01:55:14,083 --> 01:55:16,343
Very kind of you, sir.
Thank you very much.

1375
01:55:16,553 --> 01:55:18,813
I understand you had a rather

1376
01:55:19,053 --> 01:55:20,313
unfortunate

1377
01:55:20,553 --> 01:55:22,042
encounter

1378
01:55:22,322 --> 01:55:24,052
with the police tonight.

1379
01:55:24,322 --> 01:55:26,382
Yes, I suppose
you could call it that.

1380
01:55:26,662 --> 01:55:27,922
How are you feeling now?

1381
01:55:28,222 --> 01:55:29,492
Much better, thank you.

1382
01:55:29,732 --> 01:55:32,092
Feel like talking,
answering a few questions?

1383
01:55:32,362 --> 01:55:33,692
Fine, sir. Fine.

1384
01:55:34,532 --> 01:55:37,191
As I said, we've heard about you.

1385
01:55:37,701 --> 01:55:40,361
We are interested in your case.

1386
01:55:40,571 --> 01:55:43,501
- We want to help you.
- Thank you very much.

1387
01:55:43,741 --> 01:55:46,871
Shall we get down to it?

1388
01:55:47,111 --> 01:55:48,911
Fine. Fine, sir.

1389
01:55:54,220 --> 01:55:57,010
The newspapers mentioned

1390
01:55:57,220 --> 01:56:01,520
in addition to being conditioned
against acts of sex and violence

1391
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:05,120
you've inadvertently been
conditioned against music.

1392
01:56:06,130 --> 01:56:09,189
I think that was something
that they didn't plan for.

1393
01:56:09,569 --> 01:56:11,469
You see, missus

1394
01:56:11,729 --> 01:56:15,189
Im very fond of music.
Especially Beethoven.

1395
01:56:16,309 --> 01:56:18,269
Ludwig van Beethoven.

1396
01:56:18,539 --> 01:56:20,869
- B-E...
- It's all right, thank you.

1397
01:56:21,379 --> 01:56:25,438
And it just so happened that
while they were showing me

1398
01:56:25,708 --> 01:56:29,618
a particularly bad film
of, like, a concentration camp

1399
01:56:29,888 --> 01:56:33,448
the background music
was playing Beethoven.

1400
01:56:33,658 --> 01:56:36,418
So now you have
the same reaction to music

1401
01:56:36,658 --> 01:56:38,417
as you do to sex and violence?

1402
01:56:38,657 --> 01:56:42,987
No, missus. You see, it's not
all music. It's just the Ninth.

1403
01:56:43,227 --> 01:56:44,997
You mean Beethoven's Ninth Symphony?

1404
01:56:45,227 --> 01:56:48,257
That's right. I can't listen
to the Ninth anymore at all.

1405
01:56:48,497 --> 01:56:51,957
When I hear the Ninth, I get, like

1406
01:56:52,267 --> 01:56:53,826
this funny feeling.

1407
01:56:54,906 --> 01:56:59,176
And then all I can think about
is, like, trying to snuff it.

1408
01:56:59,476 --> 01:57:03,846
- I beg your pardon?
- Snuff it. Death, I mean.

1409
01:57:04,116 --> 01:57:06,676
I just want to die peacefully

1410
01:57:07,156 --> 01:57:09,485
like, with no pain.

1411
01:57:10,255 --> 01:57:12,155
Do you feel that way now?

1412
01:57:13,295 --> 01:57:15,285
No, sir, not exactly.

1413
01:57:15,495 --> 01:57:16,755
I still feel

1414
01:57:16,995 --> 01:57:18,295
very miserable.

1415
01:57:18,495 --> 01:57:21,025
Very much down in spirits.

1416
01:57:21,595 --> 01:57:22,865
Do you still feel

1417
01:57:23,135 --> 01:57:24,624
suicidal?

1418
01:57:27,874 --> 01:57:29,664
Put it this way:

1419
01:57:29,944 --> 01:57:32,774
I feel very low in myself.

1420
01:57:33,614 --> 01:57:35,944
I can't see much in the future.

1421
01:57:36,184 --> 01:57:40,643
I feel that any second, something
terrible is going to happen to me.

1422
01:57:53,893 --> 01:57:55,552
Well done, Frank.

1423
01:58:01,572 --> 01:58:03,362
Get the car, would you, please?

1424
01:58:23,991 --> 01:58:25,350
I woke up

1425
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:34,660
the pain and sickness
all over me like an animal.

1426
01:58:42,709 --> 01:58:45,579
Then I realized what it was.

1427
01:58:46,849 --> 01:58:49,609
The music coming up
from the floor

1428
01:58:49,879 --> 01:58:53,079
was our old friend,
Ludwig van

1429
01:58:53,349 --> 01:58:55,948
and the dreaded Ninth Symphony.

1430
01:59:03,898 --> 01:59:05,258
Let me out!

1431
01:59:05,528 --> 01:59:07,258
Open the door!

1432
01:59:07,968 --> 01:59:10,128
Come on, open the door!

1433
01:59:12,697 --> 01:59:13,967
Turn it off!

1434
01:59:14,207 --> 01:59:15,967
Turn it off!

1435
01:59:22,917 --> 01:59:23,807
Stop it!

1436
02:00:12,094 --> 02:00:13,583
Turn it off!

1437
02:00:15,023 --> 02:00:15,993
Please!

1438
02:00:16,263 --> 02:00:18,453
Turn it off!

1439
02:00:32,372 --> 02:00:35,282
Suddenly, I viddied
what I had to do

1440
02:00:35,512 --> 02:00:37,812
and what I had wanted to do.

1441
02:00:38,212 --> 02:00:40,682
And that was to do myself in.

1442
02:00:41,052 --> 02:00:42,482
To snuff it.

1443
02:00:42,822 --> 02:00:46,151
To blast off forever,
out of this wicked, cruel world.

1444
02:00:47,791 --> 02:00:50,161
One moment of pain, perhaps

1445
02:00:50,461 --> 02:00:52,221
and then sleep.

1446
02:00:52,491 --> 02:00:55,021
Forever and ever

1447
02:00:55,301 --> 02:00:56,561
and ever.

1448
02:01:21,059 --> 02:01:22,819
I jumped, O my brothers

1449
02:01:23,089 --> 02:01:24,519
and I fell hard.

1450
02:01:24,759 --> 02:01:27,059
But I did not snuff it.

1451
02:01:27,659 --> 02:01:29,258
If I had snuffed it

1452
02:01:29,528 --> 02:01:32,858
I would not be here
to tell what I told have.

1453
02:01:34,738 --> 02:01:39,368
I came back to life
after a long, black, black gap

1454
02:01:39,608 --> 02:01:42,908
of what might have been
a million years.

1455
02:02:11,636 --> 02:02:14,196
He's recovered
consciousness, Doctor.

1456
02:02:54,273 --> 02:02:55,803
Hello, lad.

1457
02:02:56,073 --> 02:02:57,603
Hello, son.

1458
02:02:58,583 --> 02:03:00,013
How are you?

1459
02:03:01,182 --> 02:03:03,172
You feeling better?

1460
02:03:07,622 --> 02:03:08,682
What

1461
02:03:08,922 --> 02:03:09,942
gives

1462
02:03:11,422 --> 02:03:13,412
O my Pee and Em?

1463
02:03:14,332 --> 02:03:15,882
What makes

1464
02:03:16,661 --> 02:03:17,561
you think

1465
02:03:17,861 --> 02:03:20,261
you are welcome?

1466
02:03:23,241 --> 02:03:25,201
There, there, Mother.
It's all right.

1467
02:03:25,401 --> 02:03:27,061
He doesn't mean it.

1468
02:03:29,541 --> 02:03:32,030
You were in the papers again, son.

1469
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:34,400
It said

1470
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:37,380
they had done
great wrong to you.

1471
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:39,580
It said

1472
02:03:39,890 --> 02:03:41,180
how the government

1473
02:03:41,420 --> 02:03:43,410
drove you to try

1474
02:03:43,690 --> 02:03:45,250
and do yourself in.

1475
02:03:47,090 --> 02:03:49,359
And when you think about it, son

1476
02:03:50,429 --> 02:03:53,089
maybe it was our fault too

1477
02:03:53,469 --> 02:03:54,689
in a way.

1478
02:03:55,799 --> 02:03:57,699
Your home's your home

1479
02:03:58,069 --> 02:04:00,589
when all's said and done, son.

1480
02:04:10,578 --> 02:04:13,108
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Doctor.

1481
02:04:22,057 --> 02:04:24,287
- How are you feeling today?
- Fine.

1482
02:04:24,597 --> 02:04:25,647
Good. May I?

1483
02:04:26,097 --> 02:04:28,117
- I'm Dr. Taylor.
- Haven't seen you before.

1484
02:04:28,397 --> 02:04:29,657
I'm your psychiatrist.

1485
02:04:29,967 --> 02:04:31,827
Psychiatrist!
Do I need one?

1486
02:04:32,097 --> 02:04:33,566
Just part of hospital routine.

1487
02:04:33,806 --> 02:04:35,966
Are we going to
talk about me sex life?

1488
02:04:37,636 --> 02:04:39,626
I'm going to show you
some slides

1489
02:04:39,906 --> 02:04:42,736
and you're going to tell me
what you think about them.

1490
02:04:43,646 --> 02:04:44,576
Jolly good.

1491
02:04:46,686 --> 02:04:48,236
You know anything about dreams?

1492
02:04:48,685 --> 02:04:49,805
Something, yes.

1493
02:04:50,015 --> 02:04:51,775
- You know what they mean?
- Perhaps.

1494
02:04:51,985 --> 02:04:53,455
You concerned about something?

1495
02:04:53,825 --> 02:04:56,815
No, not concerned, really

1496
02:04:57,095 --> 02:04:59,085
but I've been having
this nasty dream.

1497
02:04:59,325 --> 02:05:00,795
Very nasty.

1498
02:05:01,065 --> 02:05:02,965
It's like

1499
02:05:04,964 --> 02:05:07,124
when I was all smashed up,
you know

1500
02:05:07,434 --> 02:05:09,454
and half-awake
and unconscious-like

1501
02:05:09,734 --> 02:05:11,794
I kept having this dream.

1502
02:05:12,074 --> 02:05:14,974
All these doctors were
playing around with me gulliver.

1503
02:05:15,174 --> 02:05:17,264
You know, like the inside
of me brain.

1504
02:05:17,514 --> 02:05:20,413
I seem to have this dream
over and over again.

1505
02:05:20,643 --> 02:05:22,773
Do you think it means anything?

1506
02:05:23,683 --> 02:05:28,123
Patients with injuries like yours
often have dreams of this sort.

1507
02:05:28,353 --> 02:05:30,443
It's all part
of the recovery process.

1508
02:05:31,693 --> 02:05:34,483
Now then, each of these slides
needs a reply

1509
02:05:34,792 --> 02:05:36,782
from one of the people
in the picture.

1510
02:05:36,992 --> 02:05:40,192
You tell me what you think
the person would say

1511
02:05:40,462 --> 02:05:41,332
all right?

1512
02:05:41,602 --> 02:05:43,032
Righty-right.

1513
02:05:45,002 --> 02:05:47,372
"Isn't the plumage beautiful?"

1514
02:05:48,642 --> 02:05:51,111
I just say what the
other person would say?

1515
02:05:55,281 --> 02:05:56,801
Don't think about it too long.

1516
02:05:57,051 --> 02:05:59,571
Say the first thing
that pops into your mind.

1517
02:06:02,221 --> 02:06:04,621
Cabbages. Knickers.

1518
02:06:05,790 --> 02:06:08,120
It's not got a beak.

1519
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:09,620
Good.

1520
02:06:13,300 --> 02:06:17,200
"The boy you always quarreled with
is seriously ill"

1521
02:06:18,170 --> 02:06:19,900
My mind is a blank

1522
02:06:20,969 --> 02:06:24,869
and I'll smash your face
for you, yarblockos.

1523
02:06:25,139 --> 02:06:26,129
Good.

1524
02:06:28,739 --> 02:06:30,839
"What do you want?"

1525
02:06:31,909 --> 02:06:35,249
No time for the old in-out, love.
I've just come to read the meter.

1526
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:37,048
Good.

1527
02:06:40,518 --> 02:06:44,008
"You sold me a crummy watch.
I want my money back"

1528
02:06:44,528 --> 02:06:47,758
You know what you can do with
that watch? Stick it up your ass!

1529
02:06:52,097 --> 02:06:54,797
"You can do whatever
you like with these"

1530
02:06:56,397 --> 02:06:58,197
Eggiwegs.

1531
02:06:58,737 --> 02:07:00,667
I would like

1532
02:07:00,907 --> 02:07:02,237
to smash them.

1533
02:07:03,037 --> 02:07:04,337
And pick them all up

1534
02:07:04,547 --> 02:07:06,207
and throw

1535
02:07:06,447 --> 02:07:07,876
Fucking hell!

1536
02:07:08,746 --> 02:07:11,076
There. That's all there is to it.

1537
02:07:11,746 --> 02:07:13,236
Are you all right?

1538
02:07:14,116 --> 02:07:15,516
Hope so.

1539
02:07:15,686 --> 02:07:18,716
Is that the end, then?
I was quite enjoying that.

1540
02:07:19,026 --> 02:07:20,316
Good. I'm glad.

1541
02:07:20,626 --> 02:07:21,716
How many did I get right?

1542
02:07:22,025 --> 02:07:23,785
It's not that kind of a test.

1543
02:07:24,065 --> 02:07:27,355
But you seem well on the way
to making a complete recovery.

1544
02:07:28,035 --> 02:07:29,395
When do I get out, then?

1545
02:07:29,665 --> 02:07:32,295
I'm sure it won't be long now.

1546
02:07:33,675 --> 02:07:35,225
So I waited

1547
02:07:35,535 --> 02:07:37,005
and, O my brothers

1548
02:07:37,444 --> 02:07:38,804
I got a lot better

1549
02:07:39,044 --> 02:07:42,304
munching away at eggiwegs
and lomticks of toast

1550
02:07:42,544 --> 02:07:45,014
and lovely steakie-wakes.

1551
02:07:45,214 --> 02:07:46,704
And then one day

1552
02:07:46,984 --> 02:07:51,074
they said I was going to have
a very special visitor.

1553
02:07:56,523 --> 02:07:59,223
Just wait outside for a moment,
would you, Officer?

1554
02:08:02,333 --> 02:08:04,493
I'm afraid my change of schedule
has thrown you.

1555
02:08:04,763 --> 02:08:06,993
The patient's in the middle
of supper.

1556
02:08:07,233 --> 02:08:10,072
That's quite all right, Minister.
No trouble at all.

1557
02:08:11,542 --> 02:08:14,532
- Good evening, my boy.
- Hi there, my little droogies.

1558
02:08:14,772 --> 02:08:16,572
How are you getting on, young man?

1559
02:08:16,942 --> 02:08:19,172
Great, sir. Just great.

1560
02:08:19,942 --> 02:08:21,542
Can I do anything more for you?

1561
02:08:21,752 --> 02:08:23,541
I don't think so, Sir Leslie.

1562
02:08:23,751 --> 02:08:26,411
Then I leave you to it.
Nurse!

1563
02:08:29,251 --> 02:08:32,521
You seem to have a whole ward
to yourself, my boy.

1564
02:08:32,791 --> 02:08:34,021
Yes, sir.

1565
02:08:34,591 --> 02:08:36,961
And a very lonely place
it is too

1566
02:08:37,201 --> 02:08:39,560
when I wake up in the night
with me pain.

1567
02:08:41,030 --> 02:08:43,260
Anyway, good to see you
on the mend.

1568
02:08:43,540 --> 02:08:46,130
I kept in touch
with the hospital, of course.

1569
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:48,200
And now I've come down
personally

1570
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:50,030
to see how you're getting along.

1571
02:08:50,480 --> 02:08:52,770
I've suffered the tortures
of the damned.

1572
02:08:52,980 --> 02:08:54,469
Tortures of the damned.

1573
02:08:54,779 --> 02:08:57,809
Yes, I can appreciate that
you've had an extremely

1574
02:08:58,049 --> 02:09:00,809
Oh, look. Let me help you
with that, shall I?

1575
02:09:03,049 --> 02:09:07,249
I can tell you that I, and the
government of which I'm a member

1576
02:09:07,489 --> 02:09:11,448
are deeply sorry about this,
my boy. Deeply sorry.

1577
02:09:11,658 --> 02:09:12,928
We tried to help you.

1578
02:09:13,158 --> 02:09:17,258
We followed recommendations
that turned out to be wrong.

1579
02:09:17,668 --> 02:09:21,498
An inquiry will place the
responsibility where it belongs.

1580
02:09:22,168 --> 02:09:25,397
We want you to regard us
as friends.

1581
02:09:25,637 --> 02:09:26,907
We put you right.

1582
02:09:27,307 --> 02:09:29,247
You're getting
the best of treatment.

1583
02:09:29,447 --> 02:09:31,677
We never wished you harm.

1584
02:09:31,977 --> 02:09:34,647
But there are some who did, and do.

1585
02:09:35,147 --> 02:09:37,817
And I think you know who those are.

1586
02:09:38,417 --> 02:09:42,186
There are certain people who wanted
to use you for political ends.

1587
02:09:42,456 --> 02:09:44,826
They would have been
glad to have you dead

1588
02:09:45,026 --> 02:09:48,186
for they thought they could then
blame it on the government.

1589
02:09:48,826 --> 02:09:51,166
There is also a certain man

1590
02:09:51,366 --> 02:09:53,856
a writer of subversive
literature

1591
02:09:54,166 --> 02:09:56,265
who has been howling
for your blood.

1592
02:09:56,465 --> 02:09:59,875
He's been mad with desire
to stick a knife into you.

1593
02:10:00,345 --> 02:10:01,835
But you're safe from him now.

1594
02:10:02,105 --> 02:10:04,135
We put him away.

1595
02:10:06,045 --> 02:10:09,135
He found out that you
had done wrong to him.

1596
02:10:09,715 --> 02:10:12,114
At least he believed
you had done wrong.

1597
02:10:12,384 --> 02:10:16,614
He formed this idea in his head
that you had been responsible

1598
02:10:16,894 --> 02:10:20,324
for the death of someone
near and dear to him.

1599
02:10:21,164 --> 02:10:22,284
He was a menace.

1600
02:10:22,494 --> 02:10:24,624
We put him away
for his own protection.

1601
02:10:24,834 --> 02:10:26,193
And also for yours.

1602
02:10:26,963 --> 02:10:28,333
Where is he now?

1603
02:10:28,563 --> 02:10:32,023
We put him away
where he can do you no harm.

1604
02:10:32,303 --> 02:10:35,363
You see, we are looking
after your interests.

1605
02:10:35,673 --> 02:10:37,703
We are interested in you.

1606
02:10:38,473 --> 02:10:41,532
When you leave, you'll have no
worries. We'll see to everything.

1607
02:10:41,782 --> 02:10:43,902
A good job on a good salary.

1608
02:10:44,152 --> 02:10:45,872
What job and how much?

1609
02:10:46,752 --> 02:10:50,712
You'll have an interesting job at
a salary you regard as adequate.

1610
02:10:50,952 --> 02:10:53,152
Not only for the job
you're going to do

1611
02:10:53,422 --> 02:10:57,051
and in compensation for what
you believe you have suffered

1612
02:10:57,291 --> 02:11:00,961
but also because
you are helping us.

1613
02:11:02,161 --> 02:11:03,761
Helping you?

1614
02:11:04,001 --> 02:11:07,161
We always help our friends,
don't we?

1615
02:11:13,680 --> 02:11:15,910
It is no secret
that this government

1616
02:11:16,140 --> 02:11:19,310
has lost a lot of popularity
because of you, my boy.

1617
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:22,980
There are some who think that at
the next election we shall be out.

1618
02:11:23,180 --> 02:11:25,950
The press has chosen to take
a very unfavorable view

1619
02:11:26,150 --> 02:11:27,589
of what we tried to do.

1620
02:11:28,519 --> 02:11:31,819
But public opinion
has a way of changing.

1621
02:11:32,089 --> 02:11:33,789
And you, Alex

1622
02:11:34,029 --> 02:11:35,859
if I may call you Alex.

1623
02:11:36,129 --> 02:11:39,429
Certainly.
What do they call you at home?

1624
02:11:40,769 --> 02:11:42,029
My name is Frederick.

1625
02:11:42,998 --> 02:11:44,838
As I was saying, Alex

1626
02:11:45,108 --> 02:11:50,008
you can be instrumental
in changing the public's verdict.

1627
02:11:53,308 --> 02:11:55,338
Do you understand, Alex?

1628
02:11:56,218 --> 02:11:58,477
Do I make myself clear?

1629
02:12:01,387 --> 02:12:03,687
As an unmuddied lake, Fred.

1630
02:12:04,227 --> 02:12:07,627
As clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer.

1631
02:12:07,857 --> 02:12:09,297
You can rely on me, Fred.

1632
02:12:09,527 --> 02:12:10,857
Good.

1633
02:12:11,127 --> 02:12:12,567
Good boy.

1634
02:12:13,636 --> 02:12:15,466
I understand you're fond of music.

1635
02:12:15,736 --> 02:12:17,896
I have arranged a little
surprise for you.

1636
02:12:18,206 --> 02:12:19,636
Surprise?

1637
02:12:19,866 --> 02:12:21,566
One that I hope
that you will like

1638
02:12:21,836 --> 02:12:23,236
as a

1639
02:12:24,046 --> 02:12:25,406
how shall we put it

1640
02:12:25,646 --> 02:12:28,875
as a symbol of
our new understanding.

1641
02:12:29,875 --> 02:12:33,175
An understanding
between two friends.

1642
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:55,850
was cured, all right!
