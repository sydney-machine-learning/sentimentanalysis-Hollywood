[Speaking French]

834
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:45,133
Look, the car was lost
some time last night.

835
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:48,095
First, they send us to Pier 1,
then they send us here. Then what?

836
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:50,847
I don't understand why you parked the car
down by the waterfront.

837
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,183
You tell me you're staying at the Doral
in midtown Manhattan...

838
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:55,394
and you lose the car
out by the Brooklyn Bridge?

839
01:27:55,478 --> 01:27:59,439
Look, Monsieur Devereaux is scouting
locations for a film for French television.

840
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,858
He probably left the car
to look at some point of interest.

841
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:05,904
We were told by the police commissioner's office
that the car was brought to this garage.

842
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:07,906
I demand its immediate return.

843
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:11,618
You're going to have to be patient, Mr. Devereaux.
We get 400, 500 cars here a day.

844
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:14,663
Monsieur Devereaux is
a very important guest of this country.

845
01:28:14,747 --> 01:28:18,500
He's working with the absolute cooperation
and participation of your government.

846
01:28:18,584 --> 01:28:21,545
Here are his credentials
from the French consulate.

847
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:24,089
Unless you wish to see this episode
portrayed in his film...

848
01:28:24,173 --> 01:28:27,050
I suggest you locate the car immediately.

849
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:29,136
You're in a no-smoking area, sir.

850
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:31,346
Will you please
extinguish your cigarettes?

851
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:51,908
What was the weight of the car
when you got it, Irv?

852
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,918
4,795 pounds.

853
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:09,343
You sure?

854
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:12,304
That's what it was... 4,795 pounds...

855
01:29:12,388 --> 01:29:14,514
when it came into the shop.

856
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:18,226
The owner's manual says 4,675.

857
01:29:19,645 --> 01:29:21,646
It's 120 pounds overweight.

858
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:28,695
And when it was booked into Marseille,
it was 4,795.

859
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:31,948
That's still 120 pounds overweight.
Jimmy's gotta be right.

860
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:38,413
Listen, I ripped everything out of there
except the rocker panels.

861
01:29:38,498 --> 01:29:40,624
Come on, Irv!
What the hell is that?

862
01:30:01,187 --> 01:30:03,105
Uh-huh.

863
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:05,190
Well, shit!

It isn't the only car we have here.

868
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:25,001
Got it for you, Randy.
It just came in from downtown.

869
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:27,587
- Who's Devereaux?
- I am Mr. Devereaux. Why?

870
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,589
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux...

871
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:32,801
but we get a lot of cars here at night,
and sometimes it's hard to keep track...

872
01:30:32,885 --> 01:30:35,387
- You mean the car is here now?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. It's right outside.

873
01:30:35,471 --> 01:30:38,765
They, uh, stole it right
off the street from you, huh?

874
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:40,767
Goddamn.

875
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:42,936
You're gonna have to pay
the towing charge, you know.

876
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:46,606
I was told these things happen
in New York, but one never expects it.

877
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:49,818
Well, that's New York.
Is this your first trip over here?

878
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:52,904
- Yeah. Where's my car, please?
- It's right over here.
