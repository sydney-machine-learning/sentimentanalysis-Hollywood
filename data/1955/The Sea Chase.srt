1
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:20,497
<i>I remember when it began,</i>
<i>and where:</i>

2
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,873
<i>Sydney, Australia...</i>

3
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:27,336
<i>... the day Hitler rejected our ultimatum</i>
<i>to stay out of Poland.</i>

4
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:32,341
<i>I remember the ancient German freighter,</i>
<i>brooding at her moorings...</i>

5
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,179
<i>... coal bunkers and provision rooms</i>
<i>more than half empty...</i>

6
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:40,350
<i>... with the unsafe waters of two oceans</i>
<i>between her and home.</i>

7
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,146
<i>It wasn 't as though her rusty carcass</i>
<i>was worth much...</i>

8
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,481
<i>... or her men unexpendable.</i>

9
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,735
<i>She was an old lady</i>
<i>of the ocean backstreets...</i>

10
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:54,572
<i>... who should have drowned herself</i>
<i>gracefully long before.</i>

11
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:58,075
<i>So this is the story</i>
<i>of a German tramp steamer...</i>

12
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:03,539
<i>... and a salute to a man for whom</i>
<i>the sea was a changeless way of life.</i>

13
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,917
<i>The story of a ship and a man...</i>

14
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,586
<i>... who became so much</i>
<i>a part of one another...</i>

15
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,629
<i>... that his heart was her power...</i>

16
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,757
<i>... his breath, her life...</i>

17
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:16,719
<i>... his stubbornness,</i>
<i>the steel of her sides.</i>

18
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:20,014
<i>I am Jeff Napier,</i>
<i>and I knew them both...</i>

19
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,350
<i>... back in the days before the world</i>
<i>took notice of them.</i>

20
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,520
<i>Before there was a story.</i>

21
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:29,565
<i>Her crew was of no credit</i>
<i>to any sea or land.</i>

22
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,485
<i>Their captain realized that, of course.</i>

23
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,987
<i>In later years, I sometimes</i>
<i>blamed myself...</i>

24
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,491
<i>... for making a challenge</i>
<i>of his problems.</i>

25
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,704
<i>But then, I knew that wasn 't</i>
<i>the force that drove him.</i>

26
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,707
<i>I knew it was something much deeper.</i>

27
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:50,545
<i>Not loyalty, which is what one may owe</i>
<i>to others, but integrity.</i>

28
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,005
<i>A man 's supreme obligation to himself.</i>

29
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:23,036
<i>That was a recording of Berlin 's reaction</i>
<i>to Herr Hitler's defiant rejection of...</i>

30
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,496
Turn off that wireless!

31
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:34,464
On the well deck! Get back to work!

32
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,594
- Jeff.
- Karl.

33
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,222
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

34
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,809
Let's go up to my quarters.

35
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,979
- Make yourself at home, Jeff.
- Thanks.

36
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:04,786
From the heavy cruiser <i>von Moltke</i>
to the tramp steamer <i>Ergenstrasse</i>.

37
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,038
How's your father?
I heard he was made vice admiral.

38
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,916
Oh, he's as fit as a youngster.

39
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,959
Bellowing for a sea command.

40
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,463
I'm afraid he's slated for a desk
at the admiralty this war.

41
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,425
- And there's going to be war, Karl.
- There is.

42
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:23,971
And I'm slated for internment,
is that what you're trying to say?

43
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,391
Well, that's one thing.

44
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,352
I see you still carry
the old imperial flag.

45
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,895
I do.

46
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,064
Quite different from the one astern.

47
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,567
You won't get an argument
out of me on that.

48
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,737
Look, I'm Number One
of the <i>Rockhampton</i>.

49
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,282
We received orders this morning
to make ready to sail.

50
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,411
- On a war footing?
- Yes.

51
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,163
Within the week,
we'll be fighting Nazism.

52
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,876
Now, you've been fighting it since its
inception, and there are plenty like you.

53
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:59,049
Karl, before this thing breaks,
why don't you establish yourself as...

54
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,217
A traitor?

55
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:05,137
They took away my command.
Would you take away my homeland?

56
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,556
Sorry.

57
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,852
Well, don't think
I haven't considered it.

58
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:15,523
But the <i>Rockhampton</i>,
a crack vessel of the Royal Navy...

59
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,901
...certainly isn't wasting
its executive officer...

60
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:23,490
...to make a survey of the harmless old
<i>Ergenstrasse</i>, without cargo or coal...

61
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,783
...unable to sail.

62
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,910
No. It's Elsa.

63
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,496
- Elsa who?
- Elsa Keller.

64
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,416
I met her in Hamburg.
She's waiting in the car.

65
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,586
- I'd like you to meet her, Karl.
- Gladly.

66
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,381
Didn't I read sometime back
you were engaged to a girl in England?

67
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,469
And I suppose there will be
the deuce to pay when I get back...

68
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,054
...but it'll have to be.

69
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,515
And this isn't just another girl
in Australia?

70
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,017
I'm gonna marry her.

71
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,979
Let's don't keep her waiting.

72
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,237
I still keep something
for special occasions.

73
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,865
Good. Don't bother
to come any further.

74
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,533
Thank you.

75
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,953
You sent for me, sir?

76
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:14,123
Go over to our consulate fast.
Clear us for Yokohama just as we are.

77
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,542
Yokohama?
We can't make Yokohama, sir.

78
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,254
Go to our consulate.
Get into plain clothes.

79
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,714
With news the way it is,
I want no brawls.

80
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,799
Aye, aye, sir.

81
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,177
That's all right, Brounck. That's fine.

82
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,305
- Karl.
- Come in, come in.

83
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,099
Putting a chill on this.

84
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,768
Elsa, this is Captain Karl Ehrlich.

85
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,395
Karl, Miss Keller.

86
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,109
Miss Keller.

87
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,195
Haven't we met before?

88
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:31,200
I can't quite recall, but the navy
seems to be mixed up in it somehow.

89
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,535
No.

90
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:36,998
- He wouldn't have forgotten you.
- But I was in the navy.

91
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,001
- Won't you sit down.
- Thank you.

92
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,547
I recall now.

93
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,884
I was on the Riviera
when I heard the captain was...

94
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,344
Relieved of his command.

95
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:51,971
Yes.

96
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56,100
He spoke out quite boldly
against the new regime.

97
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,478
Until now, I didn't know
what happened to you, captain.

98
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,064
They didn't shoot me.

99
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,028
You know, my friendship with Karl
is a family matter...

100
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,988
...dating back a generation.

101
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,244
- Champagne, or should I freshen this?
- No, that'll do fine, thanks.

102
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,247
I have to report every four hours
to headquarters.

103
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,959
- Is there a phone aboard?
- Not aboard the ship.

104
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,837
- There's one on the next wharf.
- That'll do fine.

105
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,589
Do you mind if Elsa waits here
till I get back?

106
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,884
- Delighted.
- Well, don't be too delighted.

107
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,679
- I'll show you to the gangway.
- That's all right, I know the way.

108
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,362
It's as Jeff said.

109
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,868
I've known him since he was a boy,
which he still is, in some ways.

110
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,997
I don't know your entire history,
but I know enough.

111
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,124
So one of two things:

112
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:07,338
When he returns, either you tell him in
front of me or I tell him in front of you.

113
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,217
- Tell him what?
- About the Monte Carlo affair.

114
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:16,514
Jack Cavanaugh never knew
any attractive woman slightly.

115
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,184
There was the famous, or infamous,
cruise with Billy Norton.

116
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:26,899
Or the fact that Eric Carson shot himself
20 minutes before he was to marry you.

117
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,568
Merely gossip, captain.

118
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:33,322
Did you ever see a man
with his brains blown out?

119
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,661
You don't come into this one way
or the other, except for plain meddling.

120
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,538
Keep out of it.

121
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,206
There's a third alternate.

122
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:46,586
You can leave, never see Jeff again.
Just fade out with no explanation.

123
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,632
I'm not going to forget this.

124
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,594
No matter how long it takes,
I shall pay you back.

125
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,179
You have nothing now...

126
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:59,098
...but when I'm finished,
you won't even have this!

127
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,433
To what I promise you!

128
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,458
- Mr. Bachman.
- Yes, sir?

129
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,377
- What have you there?
- Explosives, sir.

130
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,879
- Explosives?
- Yes, sir.

131
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,964
Mr. Kirchner told me to plant them.

132
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,135
I was just coming to report.
They thought up a new one.

133
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,179
Crews of foreign ships are to be
medically examined before a clearance.

134
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:43,351
Our consul passed orders for us to
scuttle the minute we get news of war.

135
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,479
Take that stuff back
to the chief engineer.

136
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,190
- And don't go by the gangway.
- Yes, sir.

137
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,942
Get out of that shore gear,
get ready for sea.

138
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,321
I believe you're aware of my status
in Naval Intelligence.

139
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:59,658
I took the opportunity to ask the consul
to wireless home for further orders.

140
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,119
Possibly to fly me home.

141
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:06,249
Mr. Kirchner, we have not abandoned
this ship yet.

142
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,917
- Stemme.
- Sir.

143
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,919
You will go to the consul at once.

144
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,838
Pay him my respects
and inform him personally...

145
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,925
...that the weather forecast
for tonight is heavy fog.

146
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:20,763
Tell him I'll attempt to get out of Sydney
harbor tonight on my own responsibility...

147
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,099
...and shall so log it for his protection.
- Aye, aye, sir.

148
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,519
- Hurry it up.
- Yes, sir.

149
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,522
Your orders come through,
you'll be relieved of duty.

150
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,858
- Otherwise, you sail.
- We haven't a chance of getting out.

151
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:37,405
- You'll have to scuttle.
- You're mistaken, Mr. Kirchner.

152
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,784
That British officer
is in your quarters, sir.

153
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:53,129
Well. What happened?

154
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:57,174
- A little accident.
- What sort of an accident?

155
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,969
- Where's Elsa?
- She isn't here.

156
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:05,266
- What do you mean, she isn't here?
- I'm sorry, Jeff, but I can't help you out.

157
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,686
She just left and didn't say
where she was going.

158
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:13,148
- You mean to say she just walked off?
- You know women.

159
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:16,277
What are you trying to tell me?

160
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:22,283
I don't think she's gonna marry you.

161
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:27,205
You didn't tell her anything to make her
change her mind, I suppose?

162
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,210
All right, I'll find out for myself.

163
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:36,339
But if she's not at the hotel,
I'll be right back...

164
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:39,175
...because you'll be here
for the duration.

165
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,677
Are you sure?

166
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,638
Yes, I'm sure.

167
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,444
Fog won't get much heavier now.

168
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,196
Where do you propose to take
your first bearing?

169
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,866
- Here, sir.
- We won't be able to see it.

170
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,453
Perhaps we can hear it.

171
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,538
Five minutes to slack tide.
The men at their stations?

172
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,667
Yes, sir. Standing by fore and aft.
Also in the waist.

173
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,475
- Well?
- Charge has been set.

174
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:34,313
- Where do you want the detonator?
- Put it near the telegraph.

175
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,861
Cadet Stemme, are you still curious...

176
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,032
...about what happens to us
in case we're caught?

177
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,367
- You make it clear.
- Go to your station.

178
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,327
Yes, sir.

179
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,836
- Bridge.
- Bridge.

180
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,379
All ready below.

181
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,424
Engine room reports
all ready below, sir.

182
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,010
Wesser.

183
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,355
- It's a car, sir.
- Police?

184
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,691
Whoever it is, they're coming aboard.

185
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,194
Get back out of sight.

186
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,606
I must see the captain at once.

187
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,817
- Urgent.
- All right, sir.

188
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,821
Follow me. We'd better go up
on the other side.

189
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,992
It's the consul general, sir.

190
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,328
Our brilliant consulate service.
What does he...?

191
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:57,081
Get back to your station.

192
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,757
Captain Ehrlich, sir. Gentlemen.

193
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,677
As you know, I cannot condone
this mad venture, but if...

194
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,513
- What do you want, Mr. Consul?
- Consul general.

195
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,224
Mr. Consul General.

196
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,726
I have someone here
you must take with you.

197
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,562
I ask for coal and provisions
and get a passenger?

198
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,815
Sir, this is official.

199
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,361
Intelligence agent.
Must be out of the country...

200
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,821
...before the authorities make an arrest.

201
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:35,744
Cadet Wesser, bring the consul's...
The consul general's passenger aboard.

202
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,496
Yes, sir.

203
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,875
And you, sir, unless you wish
to sail with us...

204
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,710
...get yourself off this ship.

205
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,713
With pleasure. <i>Heil Hitler</i>.

206
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,644
The gangway's aboard
and the springs are in.

207
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:03,147
Make the signal
to let go the bowline.

208
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,158
Let go aft.

209
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,333
- Slow ahead.
- Slow ahead.

210
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,126
Slow ahead.

211
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,338
Slow ahead.

212
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,281
<i>- Engine room.</i>
- Schmitt...

213
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:59,287
...if we run aground or ram anything,
as is likely, let go with that charge.

214
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:14,135
- Ten degrees left.
- Ten degrees left, sir.

215
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,220
And hold her there.

216
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,394
<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>, Sydney.

217
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:50,296
- Wesser, more coffee.
- Yes, sir.

218
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:54,300
If you don't mind my saying so, sir...

219
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:58,721
...well, you've been on your feet
over 11 hours now...

220
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:02,725
Are you suggesting that I go
to my quarters, Mr. Wesser?

221
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,644
Well, yes, sir.

222
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,939
Maybe you're right.

223
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,864
- Stemme.
- Sir?

224
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:20,492
That passenger, I'll see him now.
Show him to my quarters.

225
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,411
She's in your quarters, sir.

226
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,040
She?

227
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,070
I had a premonition.

228
00:19:57,489 --> 00:20:00,742
Believe me, I don't want this
any more than you do.

229
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:04,453
You certainly haven't lessened
my problems any.

230
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,457
I don't know,
you might find me very useful.

231
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,543
The destroyer <i>Cressy</i> is north of you.

232
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:13,421
She left Brisbane late yesterday.

233
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:18,301
And two days ago...
Do you mind giving me a light?

234
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:30,021
- The destroyer <i>Eden</i>
left Melbourne on patrol.

235
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:33,858
The <i>Rockhampton</i> has been on
maneuvers with the Australian squadron.

236
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:37,528
Our friend Napier's
doubtless at sea again by this time.

237
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:41,825
Our friend Napier has doubtlessly
been at sea for the last six months...

238
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,243
...or you wouldn't have
this information.

239
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,080
- Are you sure?
- Quite.

240
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,958
I have to be, in my work.

241
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,793
The <i>Eden</i> and <i>Cressy</i> are old ships.

242
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:55,380
I wonder when they were
last overhauled.

243
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,465
That I don't know.

244
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,135
You see, I didn't go in for details.

245
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,304
No, I suppose not.

246
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,849
You were just in the business
of making men talk.

247
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,435
And they usually did.

248
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:15,316
But why marriage?
Wouldn't Jeff talk without it?

249
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:19,612
Or at this stage, did you want to add
a wedding ring to your trophies?

250
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:23,908
I had orders to acquire
British nationality by marriage...

251
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:26,827
...preferably into a naval family.

252
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:31,040
But I shall see that my failure
to comply is reported...

253
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,710
...completely, and with reasons.

254
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:38,089
So long as you had
to hurt Jeff so badly...

255
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:41,842
...I'm sorry it was
cold-blooded duty with you.

256
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:47,265
- Did you bring any baggage aboard?
- Only one case.

257
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:51,603
If you need any extra clothing,
we can outfit you from the slop chest.

258
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,939
Where do I sleep?

259
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,865
Right in here.

260
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,952
You'll find fresh bed linen in that closet.

261
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,329
- Here's the bath...
- I found it.

262
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:13,500
...which connects with
my sleeping quarters.

263
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:18,504
- There's a lock on both sides of the door.
- I found that too.

264
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:21,883
So we now share a wonderful bond:

265
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,926
Mutual self-preservation.

266
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:26,846
I don't want prison,
and you don't want internment.

267
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:30,224
You'd have been lucky
to get away with a prison sentence...

268
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:35,146
...so I don't think you'll complain if you
find this ship slightly similar to a prison.

269
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,398
Prison is only a state of mind.

270
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:42,153
Well, I'm in a tired state of mind
right now.

271
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,412
<i>Bridge.</i>

272
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:55,583
Have all officers report to the bridge
at the change of watch, and call me.

273
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,585
<i>Aye, aye, sir.</i>

274
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:03,425
And now, if you don't mind...

275
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:34,330
Your invitation to the wardroom
is accepted, gentlemen.

276
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:37,958
And I have not come empty-handed.
I have two signals here.

277
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:41,504
Number one, we have
declared war on Germany.

278
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,130
Finally.

279
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:46,175
Number two, a German freighter,
the <i>Ergenstrasse</i>...

280
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,511
...slipped out of Sydney last night.

281
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:52,682
Ours is the not-too-glorious task
of making a sweep and intercepting her.

282
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:56,185
Sit down, gentlemen.
There goes your leave, Napier.

283
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:58,855
- What will you have to drink?
- Beer, thank you.

284
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:02,817
It'd seem they'd find us something
more important to do.

285
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:05,903
This is our position.

286
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:10,575
One of the destroyers is somewhere
along this arc, about here.

287
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:13,578
I expect it to pass inshore of us.

288
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:15,621
The other one is about here.

289
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:19,876
I'm reducing speed shortly
so it'll pass offshore.

290
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:23,546
I hope. The <i>Rockhampton</i>,
I think we can discount at present.

291
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:26,382
- It'll be a tight squeeze, sir.
- And a chance.

292
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:29,802
Double the lookouts and turn tail
at every shadow of smoke.

293
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,554
- Keep ours at a minimum.
- But that destroyer...

294
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:34,932
...she can cut us off, sir.

295
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,435
That is no longer our course,
Mr. Bachman.

296
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:42,106
We're not attempting
to make Yokohama. That is all.

297
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:47,486
Sir, if we're turning south,
what will we burn for coal?

298
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,822
What will we eat?
There are no ports.

299
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:54,243
I'll appropriate food at the shipwreck
relief station on Auckland Island.

300
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:57,622
- But fuel...
- One thing at a time, Mr. Kirchner.

301
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:01,584
I think you're well indoctrinated
in the game of follow-the-leader.

302
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:05,296
- Yes, but I was under the impression...
- Muster all hands.

303
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,510
You're to keep all ports covered.

304
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,471
Smoking lamp is out
except on specific order.

305
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:15,848
And nothing to be thrown overboard.

306
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:20,186
- Nothing, from now on.
- I believe I have made it quite obvious...

307
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:24,899
...to everyone onboard this ship
what my political views are.

308
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:28,694
But now, for better or for worse,
we are at war.

309
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:32,406
This ship is halfway
around the world from its home.

310
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:37,286
I intend to bring it under the safety
of the flag stead light.

311
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:41,624
That is all.

312
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:49,298
What about pay?
He's gonna work us navy-fashion.

313
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:52,051
What's wrong with that?
I was in the old war.

314
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,803
- He talks well.
- Dishwasher third class?

315
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:58,516
Sergeant. I'll show you my medals.

316
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,101
Hey...

317
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:25,793
All right, down there.
Get on with the work.

318
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:32,550
Down there. Come on, break it up.

319
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:50,610
You might have asked me to the muster.
Is there a reason I should be in the dark?

320
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:53,738
- There is.
- What?

321
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,533
I'll tell you forward.

322
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:01,913
Find something to keep you busy
on the well deck.

323
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:07,459
You will keep off the main decks,
night and day...

324
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:11,255
...and off the bridge
unless specifically ordered there.

325
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:14,926
You can take your exercise
on the after part of the boat deck...

326
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:19,514
...and keep out of the inboard passage
to the officers' quarters.

327
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:23,267
Just where are we going?

328
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:28,731
I would also suggest you wear something
a little more suitable for the ship.

329
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:29,940
Why?

330
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:35,404
The officers and men aboard this ship
haven't had shore leave since Singapore.

331
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:41,077
Are you speaking entirely
for the officers and men, captain?

332
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:43,829
Not entirely.

333
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:45,581
We're all human.

334
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:50,670
But, unfortunately, at sea there's
no chance to enjoy our humanity.

335
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,800
Your meals will be served in your cabin.
I think that does it.

336
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:59,053
If there's anything else you need,
let me know.

337
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:01,973
Thanks.

338
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:14,361
By estimate, the <i>Ergenstrasse</i>
was carrying less than 600 tons of coal.

339
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:19,532
He has to go north, reaching for Truk
or other of the Japanese mandates.

340
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:23,703
With the <i>Cressy</i> in his path and ourselves
and <i>Eden</i> closing in, that's it.

341
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,663
Yes, that should be it.

342
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,041
Let's not be so pessimistic, Napier.

343
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:32,754
- Bosun.
- Yes, sir?

344
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:37,050
- Make sure the deadlights are closed.
- Right, sir.

345
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:45,391
So we play fox and hounds, captain?

346
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,518
Successfully so far, chief.

347
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:50,605
But from now on
it's an engineer's operation.

348
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,982
Let's take a look at the books.

349
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:56,944
See how much coal we have,
how much we're gonna need.

350
00:28:57,112 --> 00:28:58,488
It's bad.

351
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:00,990
- You can burn wood, can't you?
- Sure, but...

352
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:03,534
Well, I'm getting you wood.

353
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:06,955
Figure out how many cords
you'll need for the 2600 miles...

354
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:10,667
...between Pom Pom Galli
and Valparaiso.

355
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,209
Pom Pom Galli?

356
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:14,670
Now to Auckland,
then to Pom Pom Galli?

357
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:18,424
On what coal we have and a prayer.

358
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:19,925
- Mr. Kruger.
- Yes, sir.

359
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:22,553
- Keep that headset glued to your ears.
- Aye.

360
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:25,432
To Valparaiso, one-third
the way around the world.

361
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:27,933
- That's right.
- You need saws and axes...

362
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:29,602
...to cut your wood.

363
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:32,438
- I'll make them for you.
- Good man.

364
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:36,734
We'll need double-bitted axes
and two-man saws.

365
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:40,070
But the next time home, I retire.

366
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:41,781
No more.

367
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:44,825
The years have run
their journey over me.

368
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:49,622
From now on, it's my little farm
and my grandchildren.

369
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,958
You know, it's funny
about grandchildren:

370
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:55,670
They seem closer to you...

371
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,755
You don't have any children.

372
00:29:57,922 --> 00:29:59,298
No, I have no family.

373
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:03,845
But you get me to Valparaiso,
and I'll promise you yours.

374
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:08,683
The dreams, eh, captain?
The old days?

375
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:12,979
A man has weakness or strength,
Schmitt.

376
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:17,525
Weakness, you can hide,
like red lead over a sprung rivet...

377
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,694
...but it'll give under strain.

378
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:23,531
Strength, you cannot defeat. Ever.

379
00:30:23,698 --> 00:30:26,242
Don't worry about me, captain.

380
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,494
I'll shovel you to Valparaiso.

381
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,705
I'll shovel you all the way home.

382
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:39,172
<i>Tomorrow came, and the next day,</i>
<i>and the next...</i>

383
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,549
<i>... the</i> Ergenstrasse <i>still unreported.</i>

384
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:45,678
<i>We'd been hoping she'd break</i>
<i>wireless silence, but she never did.</i>

385
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:50,599
<i>Ehrlich was like a fox, choosing his</i>
<i>secret places and listening to us.</i>

386
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:53,770
<i>All we needed was one clue.</i>
<i>Then, with our speed...</i>

387
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:57,982
<i>... the search would end with</i>
<i>a flash of pursuit and a burst of guns.</i>

388
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:02,611
<i>With Ehrlich 's fuel range, we could rule</i>
<i>out the vast Pacific toward the west.</i>

389
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:07,700
<i>Eastward, he could reach the Indian</i>
<i>Ocean, but he'd be even worse off there.</i>

390
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:10,786
<i>And south? That didn 't seem probable...</i>

391
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:14,624
<i>... because nothing was there</i>
<i>except the Antarctic.</i>

392
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,104
Careful, I'm afraid you're showing
a light here.

393
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:21,941
It seems to be stuck.

394
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,570
You'll have to keep it closed.

395
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:28,990
You know our captain's orders.

396
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:36,163
I think I'm going slightly mad,
day in and day out.

397
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:37,832
I've read until I'm blind.

398
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:40,960
I've walked my 10 feet
of private deck until I'm numb.

399
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:44,672
This is going to be an unpleasant trip
for a woman.

400
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:47,675
For anyone with no work to do.

401
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:50,594
Think the captain has a chance
of getting anywhere?

402
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:54,974
I don't know.
He has irritatingly good judgment.

403
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:57,935
At sea, he knows all the answers.

404
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:01,105
But if and when we ever get home...

405
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:04,400
What?

406
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:07,444
My uncle is very high in the party,
you know.

407
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:13,118
Then why are you on this ship?
Why not a more important job?

408
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:14,827
Don't judge by appearances.

409
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:17,997
As an agent, you should know better.
I'm Intelligence.

410
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:21,626
Navy reserve. Harbor survey.

411
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:24,587
And it seems that
I stayed at it too long.

412
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:28,132
I stayed in Australia too long.

413
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:32,136
What about my gramophone?
Would that help the mood?

414
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:35,306
I've got some wonderful recordings
of Wagner.

415
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:37,016
How cheerful.

416
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:40,853
Well, l... I've got some
popular things too.

417
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:43,356
Quite an excellent collection.

418
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:48,194
- Will you wait?
- Oh, I'll be at home all evening.

419
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:02,249
Memories...

420
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:05,294
Pleasant memories?

421
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:07,589
Exciting ones.

422
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:10,884
How long ago?

423
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:15,805
A thousand years.

424
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,186
Let's you and I go into partnership.

425
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:23,855
What kind of partnership?

426
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:26,441
We're in the same game,
let's play together.

427
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:29,152
You tell me your troubles,
I'll tell you mine.

428
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:33,406
And if we get a chance,
we'll haul out together.

429
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:37,410
That's fair enough.
What are your troubles?

430
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:44,167
Mr. Kirchner.

431
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:48,671
May I remind you
that you're not on a cruise ship...

432
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:51,966
...and this is technically still my cabin.

433
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:56,262
Yes, sir.

434
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:02,143
- I asked him to come in.
- I daresay you did.

435
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,687
I asked him to leave.

436
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:08,983
My officers' quarters
are off-limits to you...

437
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,278
...and this cabin is off-limits
to my officers.

438
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:14,321
Do I make myself clear?

439
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:16,866
Quite.

440
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,549
They're short of ships
in the North Atlantic.

441
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:35,009
That's probably where we'll be sent.

442
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:37,761
I wish they'd get on with it.

443
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:44,060
This fellow's short of stores and fuel.
He can't cause much trouble.

444
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:47,355
He has a genius for it.

445
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:13,131
Land ho!

446
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:15,508
Land ho!

447
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:19,887
- Where away?
- A point off the starboard bow.

448
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:27,520
- That'll be Auckland Island.
- I think it will be, Mr. Stemme.

449
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:28,813
- Log it.
- Yes, sir.

450
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,232
- Mr. Kirchner.
- Sir?

451
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:34,318
- Prepare to launch your boat.
- Aye, aye, sir.

452
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:42,368
- Mr. Kirchner.
- Sir?

453
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:46,539
I am forced to commandeer food
from the shipwreck station...

454
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:50,543
...but make sure that you leave
enough rations for any emergency...

455
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,962
...until the next relief ship arrives.

456
00:36:53,171 --> 00:36:54,797
Aye, aye, sir.

457
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:37,757
Looks like we have company.

458
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:04,950
- Are there any more of you?
- No.

459
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:07,912
We're the only survivors
of the trawler <i>Bermagui</i>.

460
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,916
You can put that gun down,
whoever ye are. We are fishermen.

461
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:13,167
What ship are you?

462
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:15,670
The freighter <i>Joanna</i>,
Dutch East India line.

463
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:18,422
But we can't take you aboard.
Smallpox.

464
00:38:18,673 --> 00:38:21,759
We can't touch any ports.
We have to tap your provisions.

465
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:25,846
Bosun, start loading those provisions
into the boat.

466
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,318
Do you think you're doing right?
Robbing a shipwreck station?

467
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:42,238
I'll leave enough till
another ship calls for you.

468
00:38:42,405 --> 00:38:45,950
That's all well and good,
if we get the wireless working.

469
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:49,620
Don't worry.
We'll send out your SOS.

470
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,012
Mr. Kirchner, have you seen
the charts on the Chatham Islands?

471
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:51,807
Second officer corrected them, sir.
Took them to your day cabin.

472
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:54,185
Thank you.

473
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:08,533
- Yes?
- I have to look at a couple of charts.

474
00:40:11,828 --> 00:40:13,955
Sorry to have bothered you.

475
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:17,083
I hope I haven't
bothered you too much.

476
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:24,715
You've got enough of that stuff
to keep you busy the whole trip.

477
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:28,761
Fortunately. What else is there to do?

478
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:34,141
- Have a drink, perhaps. Would that help?
- It never hurts.

479
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:42,734
Suppose you do get all the way home.

480
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:47,405
There's no place there for you,
under the present government.

481
00:40:47,572 --> 00:40:51,867
What else could I do?
Certainly not default to the enemy.

482
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:57,123
Have you ever in your life made
a compromise with a conviction?

483
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:03,713
I was always afraid that if I started,
it wouldn't be easy to stop.

484
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:08,884
I suppose you're referring to me.
Intending an insult.

485
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:11,679
I think you should know
one thing, captain:

486
00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:13,472
You can't insult me...

487
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,351
...because I hold no value
for the way you think.

488
00:41:16,518 --> 00:41:18,978
And I know the way you think.

489
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:21,897
- Ideals and gallantries...
- That's right.

490
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:23,649
The officer's code.

491
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:26,402
That's the way my father thought.

492
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:28,112
He was a general.

493
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:30,990
A very great gentleman
of the old school.

494
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:33,367
But after the war,
when things changed...

495
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:36,538
...and he discovered that
uniforms, medals and honor...

496
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:40,291
...couldn't buy food and medicine
for his family, what did he do?

497
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:43,627
He couldn't beg
or violate the code, no.

498
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:46,047
So he shot himself.

499
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:49,758
Leaving me and my sisters
and my mother to survive.

500
00:41:49,926 --> 00:41:51,928
That was his way...

501
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:53,429
...and your way.

502
00:41:53,638 --> 00:41:55,348
But it's not my way.

503
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:56,891
I survived, all right.

504
00:41:57,058 --> 00:41:59,727
I made my own life, my own code.

505
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:04,189
You have your medals and your trophies.
Well, I have my trophies too.

506
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:06,692
You see, I have succeeded,
Captain Ehrlich.

507
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,738
Did anyone ever tell you that
you're beautiful when you're angry?

508
00:42:11,197 --> 00:42:14,658
The captain hasn't had shore leave
since Singapore.

509
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:20,456
You're quite a woman, Elsa.

510
00:43:06,419 --> 00:43:08,754
He was in your room.

511
00:43:08,922 --> 00:43:11,007
He came to get some charts.

512
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:13,509
Took him quite a while.

513
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:16,888
His only interest is his ship.

514
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:18,931
He's a strange man.

515
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:21,851
In anyone else,
his beliefs would be a pose.

516
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:24,437
Not Ehrlich. They're his life.

517
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:27,940
You sound as if you're losing
your dislike for him.

518
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:30,318
I don't think that will happen.

519
00:43:30,485 --> 00:43:32,612
Anyway, what difference
does it make?

520
00:43:32,779 --> 00:43:35,907
We're gonna be a long time
tied down on this ship.

521
00:43:36,074 --> 00:43:38,910
A long, dreary time.

522
00:43:39,577 --> 00:43:40,953
I expect we'll survive.

523
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:46,126
Well, with certain
compensating moments, perhaps.

524
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:48,377
Elsa...

525
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:52,340
...I find you a very
fascinating woman.

526
00:43:52,507 --> 00:43:53,758
Do you?

527
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:59,263
I don't like impatient men.

528
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:03,226
I can be very, very patient,
as long as I know he isn't...

529
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:06,020
He isn't.
And he won't be.

530
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:14,612
Chief.

531
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:17,031
Chief, you're cutting down
on my speed.

532
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:21,160
We're gonna need every day and minute
when we get to Pom Pom Galli...

533
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:24,788
...when the <i>Rockhampton</i> starts making
its sweep to the north.

534
00:44:24,956 --> 00:44:29,251
- What's the matter with you?
- Headwinds, captain.

535
00:44:30,545 --> 00:44:31,879
It's the headwinds.

536
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:34,549
I didn't wanna tell you
until I was positive...

537
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:38,636
...but we don't have enough coal
to run to Pom Pom Galli.

538
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:42,390
- Are you sure?
- That's the story.

539
00:44:43,683 --> 00:44:45,976
No coal, eh?

540
00:44:46,144 --> 00:44:47,854
No coal.

541
00:44:48,021 --> 00:44:49,397
Well, we got wood.

542
00:44:49,564 --> 00:44:53,192
We'll burn this ship in her own fires.

543
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:17,759
Ask the engine room,
how does it look.

544
00:45:19,344 --> 00:45:21,721
<i>- Engine room.</i>
- How's the wood lasting?

545
00:45:21,888 --> 00:45:23,639
<i>Four more hours, I can give you.</i>

546
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:26,643
Chief engineer says he can
only give four more hours.

547
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:35,068
Then we'll start on the lifeboats.

548
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:37,445
And if that isn't enough...

549
00:45:37,612 --> 00:45:40,531
...we'll tear out the hatches
and the doors...

550
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:42,992
...take our chances on the weather.

551
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:44,660
- Winkler.
- Yes, sir?

552
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:47,079
My sextant.

553
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:57,757
- Captain, sir.
- Yes?

554
00:45:57,924 --> 00:46:01,761
I'm no informer, but I think there's
something you're entitled to know.

555
00:46:01,928 --> 00:46:03,721
Know what?

556
00:46:03,888 --> 00:46:05,806
From the forecastle...

557
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:08,977
...they're saying a ship
belongs to her captain...

558
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:11,563
...but the lifeboats belong to her crew.

559
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:18,069
How do you feel about it, Winkler?

560
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:22,740
I don't know, sir.
I haven't made up my mind.

561
00:46:23,825 --> 00:46:25,868
- Stemme.
- Yes, sir?

562
00:46:26,036 --> 00:46:29,956
- Have the chief meet me in my cabin.
- Right, sir.

563
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:32,750
Thanks for telling me.

564
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,680
All hands, turn to.

565
00:46:46,765 --> 00:46:48,516
Trouble?

566
00:46:48,683 --> 00:46:50,810
Perhaps not.

567
00:46:52,145 --> 00:46:53,729
Chief.

568
00:46:54,189 --> 00:46:56,524
Down to the lifeboats, huh?

569
00:46:56,691 --> 00:46:58,567
Right.

570
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:08,077
- Bosun.
- Aye, sir?

571
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:12,206
Let go of the lashings on number three
and number four boats...

572
00:47:12,415 --> 00:47:15,334
...and smash them for fuel.

573
00:47:16,836 --> 00:47:18,254
All right, sir.

574
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:24,677
Schlieter, you other men, swing in
number one and number two boats.

575
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:39,066
All right, start working.

576
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:50,244
They're breaking up the boats, chief.

577
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:54,833
Yes. There are two more,
and we'll have to use those too.

578
00:48:09,597 --> 00:48:14,685
Will you kindly stay off the bridge
and in your cabin.

579
00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:27,865
Engine room reports
pressure still dropping, sir.

580
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:36,707
All right...

581
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:39,585
...break up boat number two.

582
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:58,540
Land ho! Land ho!

583
00:49:58,748 --> 00:50:01,834
- Where away?
- A point off starboard bow, sir.

584
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:06,839
Log it, Mr. Kirchner.

585
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:12,011
Schlieter, don't let
there be a next time.

586
00:50:53,386 --> 00:50:57,598
Ease your helm. Midship.

587
00:51:03,813 --> 00:51:06,023
Row bottom at 20 fathoms, sir.

588
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:08,568
Let go!

589
00:51:18,703 --> 00:51:21,163
Tell Mr. Schmitt...

590
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:24,250
...we're finished with the engine.

591
00:51:25,293 --> 00:51:27,837
Present!

592
00:51:28,004 --> 00:51:29,672
Fire!

593
00:51:29,881 --> 00:51:32,842
Firing party, present!

594
00:51:36,846 --> 00:51:40,224
Firing party, general salute.
Present.

595
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:50,527
<i>We were instructed to continue</i>
<i>the search...</i>

596
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:53,697
<i>... and in order that the German ship</i>
<i>not be alerted...</i>

597
00:51:53,863 --> 00:51:56,115
<i>... to make no mention</i>
<i>of the atrocity...</i>

598
00:51:56,282 --> 00:51:59,326
<i>... until the authorities decided</i>
<i>to release the news.</i>

599
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:01,496
<i>But what the world would think...</i>

600
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:04,207
<i>... didn 't matter to the men</i>
<i>of the</i> Rockhampton.

601
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:08,211
<i>This was no longer the mere pursuit</i>
<i>of a freighter by a naval vessel...</i>

602
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:12,132
<i>... but a crusade against</i>
<i>the criminals of the</i> Ergenstrasse.

603
00:52:12,298 --> 00:52:14,008
<i>And to me...</i>

604
00:52:14,175 --> 00:52:18,345
<i>... henceforth, a hateful vendetta</i>
<i>against the friend I'd lost...</i>

605
00:52:18,513 --> 00:52:20,431
<i>... somewhere back there.</i>

606
00:52:20,598 --> 00:52:26,270
<i>Karl Ehrlich, a man I had</i>
<i>ceased to know.</i>

607
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:34,445
From here to Valparaiso,
it's a 14-day run.

608
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:39,117
To get there, the <i>Ergenstrasse</i> will burn
30 cords of wood a day.

609
00:52:39,284 --> 00:52:41,661
Mr. Schmitt will tell you
what that means.

610
00:52:42,078 --> 00:52:45,915
It means we work 14 hours a day.
Full hours.

611
00:52:46,082 --> 00:52:48,459
We get moonlight in four days.

612
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:51,879
When it comes,
we work 18 hours a day.

613
00:52:52,088 --> 00:52:57,176
We know it's going to be hard
and difficult, but it's the only way home.

614
00:52:57,385 --> 00:53:01,055
And for your further information,
this is an uninhabited island.

615
00:53:01,264 --> 00:53:04,016
I repeat, an uninhabited island.

616
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:06,060
Now, we're short of provisions.

617
00:53:06,269 --> 00:53:08,562
There's fresh water ashore,
but no food...

618
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:11,607
...except a few coconut palms
and breadfruit trees.

619
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:14,110
And I intend to ration them.

620
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:18,781
As for recreation, you'll have
little time for it.

621
00:53:19,157 --> 00:53:23,911
However, there will be swimming parties
morning, midday and evening.

622
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,872
As we all know,
there is a woman onboard...

623
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,584
...so it will be necessary
for me to ask you...

624
00:53:29,751 --> 00:53:34,714
...to wear some kind of clothing
during your morning and evening swims.

625
00:53:35,006 --> 00:53:41,387
During the midday break, our passenger
will cooperate and remain in her quarters.

626
00:53:41,596 --> 00:53:45,933
That is all. Bosun, turn them to.

627
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:07,413
Heinz.

628
00:54:08,665 --> 00:54:10,166
I'm all right, sir.

629
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:13,502
Of course you are, but we got
more important work for you.

630
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:17,840
- You're an old soldier, aren't you?
- Yes, sir. Sergeant in the signal corps.

631
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:21,302
- So I've heard. You see that peak?
- Yes, sir.

632
00:54:21,469 --> 00:54:22,761
You'll be our lookout.

633
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:25,348
You go up there and watch for smoke.

634
00:54:25,515 --> 00:54:29,018
All points of the compass,
every daylight hour.

635
00:54:29,185 --> 00:54:31,020
And no daydreaming.

636
00:54:31,187 --> 00:54:35,441
We're all in your hands.
The ship, all of us.

637
00:54:35,942 --> 00:54:41,447
- Yes, sir.
- Here. Wear my glasses.

638
00:54:42,907 --> 00:54:44,909
Yes, sir.

639
00:54:48,705 --> 00:54:51,416
Back to your pots and pans,
huh, soldier?

640
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:56,671
I am the lookout.
You are all in my hands.

641
00:54:59,549 --> 00:55:01,884
Very thoughtful of you.

642
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:06,389
But don't you think that climb
is a little hard for him?

643
00:55:06,556 --> 00:55:08,516
It is.

644
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:12,687
And it is also near midday,
if you don't mind my reminding you.

645
00:55:12,812 --> 00:55:15,272
Mr. Bachman will see you
to your quarters.

646
00:55:26,951 --> 00:55:30,829
Everybody up the boat deck
before you go below.

647
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:36,211
Both hands up to the elbows.
Nothing like brine for a toughener.

648
00:55:36,378 --> 00:55:38,922
Won't help the rat bites.

649
00:55:40,715 --> 00:55:42,633
- When did you get that?
- Last night.

650
00:55:42,801 --> 00:55:45,553
Me too. On the leg.

651
00:55:45,804 --> 00:55:49,098
Well, we'll see what we can
do about it.

652
00:55:49,641 --> 00:55:53,811
- How are your people doing, chief?
- Keeping ahead of you, captain.

653
00:55:53,978 --> 00:55:55,813
Good.

654
00:55:58,817 --> 00:56:03,029
Brounck? Pack some food for Heinz.
I'll take it up to him tomorrow.

655
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:05,740
What have you there?

656
00:56:05,907 --> 00:56:09,493
Some of the meat is rotten.
I was going to throw it over the side.

657
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:13,832
You'll keep it. We'll use
everything aboard this ship.

658
00:56:42,235 --> 00:56:44,946
A lonely place for a grave.

659
00:56:45,113 --> 00:56:50,243
We'll have to get it cleaned up
before we leave.

660
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,869
I wonder who it is.

661
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:56,166
Schaffner and Becht.
Fever got them.

662
00:56:56,583 --> 00:57:01,421
I was young Stemme's age then,
in charge of the burial party.

663
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:03,715
Yes, we'll have to get it cleaned up.

664
00:57:04,382 --> 00:57:07,134
And you remember their names
after all this time?

665
00:57:08,053 --> 00:57:11,473
The Greeks believed that a man
was immortal...

666
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:14,850
...as long as his name
was remembered on earth.

667
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,353
These two were good men.

668
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:21,982
Seamen.

669
00:57:22,942 --> 00:57:26,946
You wanna see the island,
I'm taking this food up to the peak.

670
00:57:27,947 --> 00:57:29,740
Thank you.

671
00:57:55,266 --> 00:57:58,310
You'd better take a little rest.

672
00:58:04,567 --> 00:58:07,444
I hope the old soldier is all right.

673
00:58:08,446 --> 00:58:11,073
Tougher climb than I thought.

674
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:15,078
In all your life,
you've never done very much...

675
00:58:15,245 --> 00:58:18,456
...except for your men and your ships,
have you?

676
00:58:18,623 --> 00:58:23,461
When I was a cadet, they taught us
that was a way of life.

677
00:58:23,628 --> 00:58:28,424
Pretty hard to change what you learn
in your youth and believe.

678
00:58:29,092 --> 00:58:32,303
And that's what this whole
fantastic voyage is, really:

679
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:35,723
A habit of life,
stubbornness of the soul.

680
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:39,643
Not entirely. This is a part of the war.

681
00:58:39,811 --> 00:58:42,313
I'm still beating the enemy at it.

682
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:47,693
You've never really been
in love, have you?

683
00:58:48,236 --> 00:58:51,822
Once or twice I've had
charming illusions.

684
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:56,578
But never strong enough
to chance marriage?

685
00:58:57,078 --> 00:59:02,291
To put it another way,
I'm a practical man, a realist.

686
00:59:04,002 --> 00:59:07,797
With only one love, the sea.

687
00:59:07,964 --> 00:59:11,133
I never quite looked at it that way.

688
00:59:11,926 --> 00:59:15,220
I'm beginning to understand
why men go to sea.

689
00:59:15,388 --> 00:59:17,139
I've been watching it.

690
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:19,183
It's never the same.

691
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:21,519
One moment calm...

692
00:59:21,686 --> 00:59:23,813
...then stormy.

693
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:27,316
Darkness, light...

694
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:30,236
- It's always changing.
- Like a woman.

695
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:36,576
A mystery.

696
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:40,747
Part of a great mystery.

697
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:45,334
When I first met you...

698
00:59:45,502 --> 00:59:49,214
...I never thought I could sit here
trying to understand you.

699
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,010
Or even liking you.

700
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:26,167
I'll give you a hand, Mr. Kirchner.

701
01:00:44,394 --> 01:00:46,979
That should stop you.

702
01:00:47,147 --> 01:00:51,359
- Teaching her chess, chief?
- No, she's teaching me.

703
01:00:51,526 --> 01:00:55,363
- Everything go well today, captain?
- Wonderful.

704
01:00:57,032 --> 01:00:59,367
I'm glad to hear it.

705
01:01:00,326 --> 01:01:03,037
I hear you've asked for
a work party for tonight.

706
01:01:03,204 --> 01:01:04,246
That's the order.

707
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:07,667
Don't you think you're pushing
them beyond their capacities?

708
01:01:07,834 --> 01:01:09,210
These men aren't you.

709
01:01:09,377 --> 01:01:13,047
A man's capacity is
usually relative to his goal.

710
01:01:13,214 --> 01:01:15,466
You've got them working
incredible hours.

711
01:01:15,633 --> 01:01:18,135
While there's a full moon,
they'll work nights.

712
01:01:18,303 --> 01:01:21,389
They won't be able to go on
if you persist in driving...

713
01:01:22,849 --> 01:01:26,978
Elsa, in there.

714
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:37,322
I forgot to mention a highly probable
reason why I've never married:

715
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:39,657
I like to run my own ship.

716
01:01:39,824 --> 01:01:41,784
Excuse me, sir, Miss Elsa.

717
01:01:41,951 --> 01:01:44,411
Everything will be ready,
as you ordered.

718
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:47,248
Won't be able to give you
anything special to eat.

719
01:01:47,415 --> 01:01:50,292
But this is the last bottle,
as cold as I can get it.

720
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,713
I found your navy buttons
and put them in your white jacket.

721
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,465
Special dinner tonight, Elsa.
Captain's orders.

722
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:59,802
Our best tablecloth.
Haven't used it since Singapore.

723
01:01:59,969 --> 01:02:01,804
Brounck.

724
01:02:06,184 --> 01:02:09,228
So not since Singapore?

725
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:21,449
- Did you remove the rat guard?
- Right now, sir.

726
01:02:22,701 --> 01:02:26,579
- How's it going ashore?
- Nearly finished, sir.

727
01:02:28,623 --> 01:02:34,378
Smear it as far out as you can.
That ought to do it in reverse.

728
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:39,509
I got to admit, I was wrong this time.
I thought he was gonna feed it to us.

729
01:02:39,676 --> 01:02:42,762
Let's get back to the ship
and get clean.

730
01:02:59,612 --> 01:03:02,281
- What's the matter?
- Rats!

731
01:03:04,325 --> 01:03:08,954
Getting rid of some of our
more unwelcome passengers.

732
01:03:09,289 --> 01:03:11,040
Don't worry...

733
01:03:11,207 --> 01:03:13,417
...it's according to plan.

734
01:03:29,309 --> 01:03:30,643
How's it working?

735
01:03:30,852 --> 01:03:33,145
It's working.

736
01:03:33,688 --> 01:03:37,733
I'd hate to come back to this island
20 years from now.

737
01:03:44,074 --> 01:03:47,077
<i>Ours was the desperation</i>
<i>of groping in the dark.</i>

738
01:03:47,243 --> 01:03:51,372
<i>And then I began to remember an island</i>
<i>I'd once heard Ehrlich talk about:</i>

739
01:03:51,539 --> 01:03:53,082
<i>Pom Pom Galli.</i>

740
01:03:53,249 --> 01:03:56,210
<i>And our search was leading us</i>
<i>in its direction.</i>

741
01:03:56,378 --> 01:03:58,838
<i>I knew he was fighting</i>
<i>the laws of nature...</i>

742
01:03:59,005 --> 01:04:02,758
<i>... with survival hanging on the human</i>
<i>endurance of weary, driven men.</i>

743
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:06,220
<i>If we could overtake him,</i>
<i>he would hang.</i>

744
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:08,765
<i>He and his criminals.</i>

745
01:04:09,349 --> 01:04:12,352
We've scoured the Chathams,
Samoa, Fiji and the Tongas.

746
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:15,355
And it's very doubtful
he could make Pitcairn.

747
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:18,149
It almost has to be
one of the Tuamotus.

748
01:04:18,316 --> 01:04:22,278
Some island with a deep harbor,
good water and a good stand of timber.

749
01:04:22,445 --> 01:04:26,031
He has some idea about an island
in one of the more remote groups.

750
01:04:26,199 --> 01:04:27,700
That's right, Pom Pom Galli.

751
01:04:27,867 --> 01:04:31,287
A place Ehrlich said the German raider
went in the last war.

752
01:04:31,454 --> 01:04:33,581
A reason why they
might not go there.

753
01:04:33,748 --> 01:04:36,876
I can't bypass
all islands in between.

754
01:04:37,043 --> 01:04:41,839
Unfortunately, I can name 50 such
islands over 1000 miles of ocean...

755
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:44,592
...but search parties will be organized.

756
01:04:44,759 --> 01:04:46,510
- Thank you.
- This will take time.

757
01:04:46,678 --> 01:04:48,930
It'll take Ehrlich time
to chop his wood.

758
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:52,642
The ax against the hangman's noose.

759
01:05:46,821 --> 01:05:49,323
I got a system working for me
on these trees.

760
01:05:49,491 --> 01:05:52,160
I pretend they're all named
Captain Ehrlich.

761
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:55,997
First I give him this!
Then I give him this!

762
01:05:56,206 --> 01:06:00,168
And then I slice him port to starboard!

763
01:06:07,008 --> 01:06:09,260
- How did it happen?
- It was an accident.

764
01:06:09,427 --> 01:06:12,012
No, it wasn't. It was my fault.
Sorry, Winkler.

765
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:15,850
Get him aboard ship. Not you.

766
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:19,228
All right, the rest of you,
get back to work.

767
01:06:20,021 --> 01:06:24,150
Schlieter, from now on, you're gonna
do the work of two men.

768
01:06:24,317 --> 01:06:27,570
Not two like you, but two like him.

769
01:06:27,737 --> 01:06:30,072
Best man in our crew.

770
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,117
And I don't think you can do it.

771
01:06:38,498 --> 01:06:41,959
Like I've been telling you,
there's one lifeboat left.

772
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:44,420
Tahiti looks pretty good now, huh?

773
01:06:44,587 --> 01:06:49,758
Oh, shut up! I'll show him who's
the best man in this crew!

774
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:11,072
Better hurry up with swimming.
You'll miss breakfast.

775
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:12,573
That'd be a great loss.

776
01:07:12,741 --> 01:07:16,494
He means we might miss the pleasure
of our little excursion ashore.

777
01:07:36,222 --> 01:07:38,599
Shark! Shark out there!

778
01:07:39,434 --> 01:07:41,227
Shark!

779
01:07:52,364 --> 01:07:54,199
Help!

780
01:07:55,533 --> 01:07:58,035
Help!

781
01:08:02,332 --> 01:08:04,667
Help! Help! A shark!

782
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:37,950
Woolrich, give me your shirt
for a tourniquet!

783
01:08:54,551 --> 01:08:56,719
- Brounck.
- Yes, sir.

784
01:08:56,886 --> 01:09:00,472
Clear a table
and boil all the water you can.

785
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,517
Break out some clean sheets.

786
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:08,147
Mr. Bachman.

787
01:09:11,276 --> 01:09:14,028
- Sir?
- Get him into the mess hall.

788
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:15,738
Anything I can do, captain?

789
01:09:15,905 --> 01:09:18,824
Looks like we're gonna have to...

790
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:22,954
- You better put an edge on that.
- I know, I know.

791
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:28,125
You can be of some help
in the mess hall.

792
01:09:58,531 --> 01:10:00,574
Take this to shore and get rid of it.

793
01:10:00,742 --> 01:10:03,161
You'd better get on
with your working party.

794
01:10:03,328 --> 01:10:05,496
He's still alive.

795
01:10:30,605 --> 01:10:32,273
Give her one.

796
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:01,107
It's awful nice of you
to do this, Miss Keller.

797
01:14:01,274 --> 01:14:03,943
No trouble at all.
I'll have them for you tonight.

798
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:05,486
Thank you.

799
01:14:09,074 --> 01:14:12,952
- I'll give you a hand with that line.
- Well, thank you.

800
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:16,497
You know, for the past
three or four days...

801
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:19,584
My leg! My leg!

802
01:14:21,503 --> 01:14:23,171
My leg!

803
01:14:24,422 --> 01:14:28,008
- My leg!
- Brounck! You know we need... Walter!

804
01:14:30,345 --> 01:14:32,138
Hurry!

805
01:14:32,305 --> 01:14:34,598
Walter.

806
01:14:50,115 --> 01:14:52,575
He'd be more comfortable in my cabin.

807
01:14:52,742 --> 01:14:55,119
- Get it ready, Brounck.
- Yes, sir.

808
01:14:57,038 --> 01:14:59,123
Take it away!

809
01:15:13,346 --> 01:15:15,264
Captain.

810
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:16,891
What is it?

811
01:15:17,058 --> 01:15:19,894
I'm sorry to interrupt your work...

812
01:15:20,061 --> 01:15:23,314
...and I have no intention of telling you
how to run your ship.

813
01:15:23,773 --> 01:15:26,859
The only important thing now
is the condition of Stemme.

814
01:15:27,068 --> 01:15:28,861
We're doing the best we can.

815
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:31,947
The <i>Rockhampton</i>
has a doctor onboard.

816
01:15:32,574 --> 01:15:35,368
Captain. A signal, sir.

817
01:15:39,372 --> 01:15:43,709
Elsa, if I were to call the <i>Rockhampton...</i>
First, let me explain about gangrene...

818
01:15:43,877 --> 01:15:47,714
This ship or 10 more like her
isn't worth this boy's life.

819
01:15:52,385 --> 01:15:56,639
Ashore there! Have Kirchner
report aboard immediately!

820
01:15:56,806 --> 01:16:00,351
Pardon me.
Kruger, join me in my cabin.

821
01:16:06,608 --> 01:16:08,067
You sent for me?

822
01:16:13,698 --> 01:16:18,411
At Auckland Island, Mr. Kirchner,
you committed murder.

823
01:16:20,121 --> 01:16:22,039
That word hardly applies in war.

824
01:16:22,207 --> 01:16:24,751
You slaughtered those fishermen
without cause.

825
01:16:24,918 --> 01:16:29,088
- I did what was necessary, expedient.
- Log it as it happened.

826
01:16:30,173 --> 01:16:32,842
I'm waiting, Mr. Kirchner.

827
01:16:44,646 --> 01:16:46,522
Did they attack you?

828
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:50,235
I don't give my enemies
the opportunity to attack me.

829
01:16:57,784 --> 01:16:59,786
Were they armed?

830
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,038
I didn't waste time searching them.

831
01:17:04,165 --> 01:17:06,250
So stated.

832
01:17:17,345 --> 01:17:19,263
Sign it!

833
01:17:33,611 --> 01:17:37,698
Ehrlich, I promise you,
you're gonna live to regret this.

834
01:17:41,286 --> 01:17:43,705
You'll continue to
address me as "captain"...

835
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:46,374
...or spend the rest of this trip
in irons.

836
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:52,254
I consider you a filthy murderer, unfit
to grace the company of decent men.

837
01:17:52,714 --> 01:17:54,674
You've dishonored a ship.

838
01:17:54,841 --> 01:17:58,511
Were we to be captured now,
we'd be tried and hanged as criminals...

839
01:17:58,678 --> 01:18:00,554
...and deservedly so.

840
01:18:00,764 --> 01:18:04,601
There are good men aboard this ship,
Kirchner, and dark nights.

841
01:18:04,768 --> 01:18:08,146
So for your own sake, say nothing
till we get to Valparaiso.

842
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,648
Now, crawl out of here.

843
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:27,165
Schlieter, you're doing all right.

844
01:18:27,707 --> 01:18:31,752
- I got a system.
- I heard about it.

845
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:33,921
It works.

846
01:18:34,089 --> 01:18:38,468
Probably never be any love lost
between us, but I was wrong about you.

847
01:18:38,635 --> 01:18:41,137
You're doing a good job.

848
01:18:50,355 --> 01:18:52,231
Heinz!

849
01:18:58,238 --> 01:19:00,114
My heart...

850
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:04,077
You won't tell the captain?

851
01:19:04,285 --> 01:19:07,037
Well, I'm afraid I must.
You're not fit to be here.

852
01:19:07,247 --> 01:19:09,207
No, no, please.

853
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:13,795
Down there, I'm only Heinz,
the cook's mate.

854
01:19:13,962 --> 01:19:16,756
Washing pots and pans.

855
01:19:17,757 --> 01:19:21,510
- Up here, I'm the lookout.
- And we all depend on you.

856
01:19:21,678 --> 01:19:25,848
- Yes, even Captain Ehrlich.
- Even the captain.

857
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:29,310
- I'm important now.
- Yes, you are.

858
01:19:29,477 --> 01:19:33,230
But since we do depend on you,
you better get down and get some rest.

859
01:19:33,732 --> 01:19:38,820
Of course. Of course.
They'll need somebody always alert.

860
01:19:39,779 --> 01:19:42,865
Anyhow, I haven't missed everything.

861
01:19:43,033 --> 01:19:47,620
At least once, a beautiful lady
had her arm around me.

862
01:19:48,121 --> 01:19:51,165
Thank you, miss. Thank you.

863
01:19:59,257 --> 01:20:03,010
Napier, I looked at those charts again.
There are many, many islands.

864
01:20:03,178 --> 01:20:04,888
Needle-in-the-haystack stuff.

865
01:20:05,055 --> 01:20:09,350
The more I think about it, the more
certain I am he's gone to Pom Pom Galli.

866
01:20:09,851 --> 01:20:12,353
You may be right.
That's where we'll head for.

867
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,146
Right, sir.

868
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:28,536
Kruger tells me he has
a bearing on the <i>Rockhampton</i>.

869
01:20:28,703 --> 01:20:30,496
She's getting closer, chief.

870
01:20:30,663 --> 01:20:35,292
Captain, I've been going over my figures,
and with what wood we have cut...

871
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,211
Wesser.

872
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,800
Is he resting?

873
01:20:44,594 --> 01:20:46,846
Didn't you hear me?

874
01:20:48,264 --> 01:20:50,432
Is he resting?

875
01:20:50,684 --> 01:20:54,062
What's it to you?
Do you wanna log it?

876
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:56,564
You wanna make it look good
in your reports?

877
01:20:56,731 --> 01:20:58,566
You think of everything.

878
01:20:58,775 --> 01:21:01,611
Pulling the strings on all of us
like we're puppets.

879
01:21:01,778 --> 01:21:05,448
He's in there dying, understand?
You're getting your wood chopped.

880
01:21:05,657 --> 01:21:07,992
- You're gonna be a famous...
- Wesser...

881
01:21:12,247 --> 01:21:14,082
Nothing.

882
01:21:15,458 --> 01:21:16,792
You young fool!

883
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:20,713
You know what the captain has been
doing for both you and Stemme?

884
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,966
Making you sailors!
Trying to make men out of you!

885
01:21:24,134 --> 01:21:26,261
You realize how he feels
about Stemme?

886
01:21:26,469 --> 01:21:28,721
What he would do for Stemme
if he could?

887
01:21:28,888 --> 01:21:31,140
That boy isn't dying. He's dead!

888
01:21:31,307 --> 01:21:34,393
He's been dead since eight hours
after that shark bite.

889
01:21:34,602 --> 01:21:38,188
- When gangrene set in, he was...
- That'll do, chief.

890
01:21:38,773 --> 01:21:40,983
Wesser, go below.

891
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:56,499
He's only a boy, captain.

892
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,043
He was overwrought.

893
01:21:59,794 --> 01:22:03,047
- What he said...
- What he said was that...

894
01:22:03,214 --> 01:22:06,175
...I've been trying to play God.

895
01:22:08,094 --> 01:22:11,222
Perhaps he's right,
perhaps I have been.

896
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:14,267
Working them, driving them,
starving them, for what?

897
01:22:14,434 --> 01:22:15,601
Integrity.

898
01:22:15,769 --> 01:22:19,481
Integrity or vanity?

899
01:22:19,647 --> 01:22:21,440
I don't know.

900
01:22:22,067 --> 01:22:25,278
- I'm gonna signal the <i>Rockhampton</i>.
- Why?

901
01:22:25,445 --> 01:22:29,824
If there was one chance in a million of
saving that boy, I would agree with you.

902
01:22:29,991 --> 01:22:32,952
But there isn't, and you know it!

903
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:36,247
If you notify the <i>Rockhampton</i>
of our position...

904
01:22:36,706 --> 01:22:41,377
...it means every man, including Wesser,
will be stamped a war criminal.

905
01:22:42,003 --> 01:22:44,005
I tried to tell you before, captain.

906
01:22:44,172 --> 01:22:48,968
I'm fairly certain, if we clear the wood on
the beach, I can get you to Valparaiso.

907
01:22:49,135 --> 01:22:52,763
Don't make a decision tonight, captain.
Wait until morning.

908
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:59,187
All right, chief.

909
01:24:16,264 --> 01:24:19,183
Prepare to get underway
in the morning.

910
01:24:25,899 --> 01:24:28,860
We'll bury him at sea.

911
01:25:01,309 --> 01:25:03,102
Bosun!

912
01:25:04,562 --> 01:25:06,981
Stop that work.
There will be no burial.

913
01:25:14,030 --> 01:25:18,284
Schlieter, take those men with you
and lower the boat again.

914
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:20,578
Yes, sir.

915
01:25:20,745 --> 01:25:24,832
- That's the last boat.
- You heard the order, move.

916
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:30,922
Captain, I've got Winkler and Heinz
on the boat deck.

917
01:25:32,674 --> 01:25:35,093
He can't mean that!

918
01:25:35,343 --> 01:25:37,219
I don't know.

919
01:25:50,567 --> 01:25:53,403
It'll mean medical attention
for you, Heinz.

920
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:55,947
And you'll walk again.

921
01:25:56,406 --> 01:26:00,326
- I'm willing, sir.
- So am I, sir.

922
01:26:00,493 --> 01:26:04,288
I knew you would be.
Thank you both.

923
01:26:05,790 --> 01:26:08,083
Start heaving.

924
01:26:54,756 --> 01:26:56,090
That's their story, sir.

925
01:26:56,257 --> 01:26:58,884
They were carrying a charge
of explosives.

926
01:26:59,052 --> 01:27:01,846
When they hit the reef,
it blew the keel wide open.

927
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:07,852
They had only one lifeboat.

928
01:27:08,019 --> 01:27:12,398
Ehrlich got some of the injured into it,
and then there was a second explosion.

929
01:27:12,899 --> 01:27:15,234
Anything to say about
the Auckland murders?

930
01:27:15,402 --> 01:27:16,945
They denied it, of course.

931
01:27:17,112 --> 01:27:20,323
- Have the surgeon take a look at them.
- Right, sir.

932
01:27:23,034 --> 01:27:26,203
<i>When a search disclosed no wreckage</i>
<i>or other survivors...</i>

933
01:27:26,371 --> 01:27:28,456
<i>... we knew he'd slipped</i>
<i>from our grasp.</i>

934
01:27:28,623 --> 01:27:31,626
<i>The</i> Ergenstrasse<i>,</i>
<i>that tired old woman of the sea...</i>

935
01:27:31,793 --> 01:27:35,922
<i>... had gained the slight margin of time</i>
<i>necessary to reach Valparaiso.</i>

936
01:27:36,089 --> 01:27:39,008
<i>She was fast becoming</i>
<i>an international heroine...</i>

937
01:27:39,175 --> 01:27:42,761
<i>... and German propaganda</i>
<i>was smothering the Auckland incident...</i>

938
01:27:42,929 --> 01:27:44,889
<i>... to make a legend of her.</i>

939
01:28:26,848 --> 01:28:29,433
Make her fast where she is.

940
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:38,108
Tell Mr. Kirchner to wait in
the mess room until I've seen the consul.

941
01:28:38,276 --> 01:28:39,819
Yes, sir.

942
01:28:41,029 --> 01:28:43,072
The consul's in your cabin, sir.

943
01:28:43,239 --> 01:28:46,242
I'll see the port authorities
after I've talked to him.

944
01:28:46,409 --> 01:28:48,035
Yes, sir.

945
01:28:54,417 --> 01:28:57,169
Elsa, I wanna talk to you
before we go ashore.

946
01:28:57,337 --> 01:28:59,589
About this great glory you've won?

947
01:28:59,756 --> 01:29:01,424
Well, it's all yours.

948
01:29:01,591 --> 01:29:03,384
Enjoy it.

949
01:29:03,551 --> 01:29:05,844
But enjoy it alone.

950
01:29:15,689 --> 01:29:16,981
Hepke, consul general.

951
01:29:17,148 --> 01:29:19,650
Ehrlich, you've established
a great tradition.

952
01:29:19,818 --> 01:29:22,362
Thank you, consul general.
Have a chair.

953
01:29:22,529 --> 01:29:25,615
An accomplishment to be written
in the annals of the sea.

954
01:29:25,782 --> 01:29:29,368
- The voyage isn't completed yet, sir.
- You achieved your purpose.

955
01:29:29,536 --> 01:29:32,038
To risk capture again
might destroy everything.

956
01:29:32,205 --> 01:29:37,001
You are proof that the great
Royal Navy is not, after all, invincible.

957
01:29:37,168 --> 01:29:41,589
Now, give me the straight story on this
propaganda the British are putting out...

958
01:29:41,756 --> 01:29:44,300
...those so-called murders
at Auckland Island.

959
01:29:44,509 --> 01:29:46,427
It's not propaganda.

960
01:29:46,594 --> 01:29:49,138
They were murders.
There's the proof.

961
01:29:49,347 --> 01:29:53,267
I prefer to believe they were armed
belligerents erecting a wireless station.

962
01:29:53,435 --> 01:29:55,520
That they were killed
in open combat.

963
01:29:55,687 --> 01:29:59,357
The first land action in the Pacific,
and a gallant victory for us.

964
01:29:59,524 --> 01:30:03,444
That story, with the news of your arrival,
has flashed around the world.

965
01:30:03,987 --> 01:30:08,282
By what right do you compound murder
with a bald-faced lie?

966
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:12,495
By whose authority do you compromise
this ship and my personal honor?

967
01:30:13,955 --> 01:30:17,083
Think of your crew.
Haven't they a right to a good name?

968
01:30:17,292 --> 01:30:19,294
I intend they'll keep that right...

969
01:30:19,461 --> 01:30:22,630
...not have it dragged through the mud
for one man's crime.

970
01:30:22,797 --> 01:30:27,468
I plan to take the man responsible,
my chief officer, Mr. Kirchner...

971
01:30:27,635 --> 01:30:31,180
...before a naval court-martial
as soon as we're home.

972
01:30:31,389 --> 01:30:34,100
That's your privilege,
and it's quite correct...

973
01:30:34,267 --> 01:30:36,269
...but for the sake of our country...

974
01:30:36,436 --> 01:30:40,189
...let's not air our dirty linen here,
before an often hostile press.

975
01:30:40,357 --> 01:30:42,609
What do you suggest that I do?

976
01:30:42,776 --> 01:30:46,237
The <i>Rockhampton</i> is due in Valparaiso
tomorrow. You can't leave.

977
01:30:46,404 --> 01:30:48,739
I'll take my chances with the British.

978
01:30:48,907 --> 01:30:52,785
They won't waste a warship
watching this harbor for long.

979
01:30:53,536 --> 01:30:55,746
Very well, captain, if you insist.

980
01:30:55,914 --> 01:30:59,751
Seamanship is your forte. But I beg
to remind you, propaganda is mine.

981
01:30:59,918 --> 01:31:03,087
- Lf I assist you, you must help me.
- I won't lie for you.

982
01:31:03,254 --> 01:31:07,841
I wouldn't think of asking you to lie.
You haven't had the diplomatic training.

983
01:31:08,009 --> 01:31:10,094
Just let me handle the press releases.

984
01:31:10,261 --> 01:31:14,098
In exchange, I'll get you your clearance
papers, everything you need.

985
01:31:14,265 --> 01:31:17,309
Kirchner will ask for a passport
and passage home.

986
01:31:17,477 --> 01:31:20,104
I insist that he return
on this ship with me.

987
01:31:20,271 --> 01:31:23,107
If that's your wish, of course, captain.

988
01:31:23,274 --> 01:31:27,278
Don't forget, tomorrow you'll be guest
of honor at a banquet, Hotel Astur.

989
01:31:27,445 --> 01:31:31,615
I've arranged quarters for you there,
and my aides will be at your disposal.

990
01:31:31,783 --> 01:31:34,202
So for now, good day, captain.

991
01:31:34,953 --> 01:31:36,663
Good day.

992
01:31:58,143 --> 01:32:03,690
Must have been exciting, one woman
on a ship, alone, with so many men.

993
01:32:05,108 --> 01:32:07,985
Especially with the great
Captain Ehrlich.

994
01:32:09,112 --> 01:32:12,115
- He is so, so...
- I know.

995
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:24,001
Good evening.

996
01:32:25,962 --> 01:32:28,089
- How perfect.
- Thank you.

997
01:32:28,256 --> 01:32:31,550
You know, for once,
I'm actually sorry for Ehrlich.

998
01:32:32,844 --> 01:32:36,138
Why? After all, he's achieved
everything he's wanted.

999
01:32:36,306 --> 01:32:39,100
Well, every man to his own desires.

1000
01:32:40,477 --> 01:32:42,979
- Where are we dining?
- A little café.

1001
01:32:43,146 --> 01:32:45,439
- Do they have music?
- Oh, yes.

1002
01:32:45,607 --> 01:32:49,444
- Exciting?
- With you, yes.

1003
01:32:57,535 --> 01:32:59,161
Stand up straight, please.

1004
01:32:59,329 --> 01:33:01,539
Lean closer, please.

1005
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:05,084
Easy, man.
She's enough for both of us.

1006
01:33:05,794 --> 01:33:08,963
- Take another picture.
- Thank you.

1007
01:33:10,382 --> 01:33:12,926
Here comes our captain now.

1008
01:33:26,147 --> 01:33:30,025
- Tell us how you evaded the English.
- No, Auckland Island, captain.

1009
01:33:30,193 --> 01:33:32,028
Now, I've covered that for you.

1010
01:33:32,195 --> 01:33:35,781
Have your pictures, but the captain's
too weary to be interviewed.

1011
01:33:35,949 --> 01:33:39,035
- Even about Auckland Island?
- Take your pictures, sir.

1012
01:33:39,202 --> 01:33:40,578
All right.

1013
01:33:58,763 --> 01:34:02,475
Again we must emphasize,
photographs, but no interviews.

1014
01:34:05,395 --> 01:34:08,147
It's been a long chase, Karl.

1015
01:34:08,398 --> 01:34:11,150
I wish I could say
it had been a good one.

1016
01:34:12,152 --> 01:34:16,781
All I care to hear is a retraction of these
German lies about Auckland Island.

1017
01:34:17,907 --> 01:34:20,534
Do you say those men were armed?

1018
01:34:21,036 --> 01:34:25,206
Do you say they were building a
military wireless on a shipwreck station?

1019
01:34:25,373 --> 01:34:30,419
Do you say they opened fire, these
helpless, unarmed men I found dead?

1020
01:34:30,837 --> 01:34:31,963
Do you?

1021
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:34,340
You were in command
of that shore party.

1022
01:34:34,507 --> 01:34:37,301
- And you were the last to leave.
- British lies.

1023
01:34:37,469 --> 01:34:38,970
Not from Jeff Napier.

1024
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:40,805
Do you?

1025
01:34:44,184 --> 01:34:48,605
Whatever my ship is charged with,
I am charged with.

1026
01:34:48,772 --> 01:34:52,817
The truth is set down in my log
for you or anyone else to read...

1027
01:34:52,984 --> 01:34:55,444
...the day you take my ship.

1028
01:34:56,529 --> 01:35:00,366
I never wanted to believe
you sanctioned those murders...

1029
01:35:00,867 --> 01:35:03,494
...but now I call you what you are:

1030
01:35:03,661 --> 01:35:08,123
A murderer, a liar and a coward!

1031
01:35:08,291 --> 01:35:11,502
Napier! You're forgetting
who and where you are.

1032
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:13,546
Wait outside.

1033
01:35:17,509 --> 01:35:20,929
Captain Ehrlich, the <i>Rockhampton</i>
will be waiting for you.

1034
01:35:21,096 --> 01:35:25,100
Nothing would give me greater pleasure
than to have you attempt to leave.

1035
01:35:25,266 --> 01:35:26,892
Good night, sir.

1036
01:35:28,937 --> 01:35:32,857
- Elsa, please.
- Don't touch me!

1037
01:35:34,150 --> 01:35:37,611
The English are bad losers
and flaunters of international law.

1038
01:35:37,779 --> 01:35:40,782
Proceed with the banquet.
I'll join you later.

1039
01:35:40,949 --> 01:35:44,160
I'll soon have a statement ready
on this barbaric incident.

1040
01:35:44,327 --> 01:35:46,746
- Get the people to the banquet.
- Yes, sir.

1041
01:35:46,913 --> 01:35:48,581
Captain.

1042
01:36:05,098 --> 01:36:09,227
Your restraint was admirable, captain.
The courage of silence.

1043
01:36:09,394 --> 01:36:12,397
It made the English appear
all the more the aggressors.

1044
01:36:12,564 --> 01:36:14,232
Get out.

1045
01:36:15,191 --> 01:36:16,984
Oh, this has upset you.

1046
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:22,323
- You shouldn't be alone.
- Perhaps not, but I can do without you.

1047
01:36:22,824 --> 01:36:26,452
You're tired. I'll see you
after you've had some rest.

1048
01:36:46,806 --> 01:36:48,891
- <i>Operator.</i>
- Miss Keller's room, please.

1049
01:36:49,059 --> 01:36:50,810
<i>One moment, please.</i>

1050
01:36:52,062 --> 01:36:54,147
- She's not?
- <i>Shall I try later?</i>

1051
01:36:54,314 --> 01:36:57,150
- Did she leave word where she'd be?
- <i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

1052
01:36:57,317 --> 01:36:59,319
- <i>Shall I try later?</i>
- Thank you.

1053
01:36:59,486 --> 01:37:01,196
<i>Thank you.</i>

1054
01:37:12,374 --> 01:37:13,917
Elsa.

1055
01:37:17,671 --> 01:37:19,673
Oh, Karl!

1056
01:37:30,308 --> 01:37:35,563
That night aboard the ship,
I told you my way of thinking.

1057
01:37:36,398 --> 01:37:39,442
Yet I didn't tell you
the complete truth...

1058
01:37:40,276 --> 01:37:43,487
...because I never even
admitted it to myself.

1059
01:37:44,906 --> 01:37:46,949
Still, it was there.

1060
01:37:47,701 --> 01:37:51,037
You had your illusions and ideals.

1061
01:37:51,871 --> 01:37:54,582
I never had any illusions...

1062
01:37:55,291 --> 01:37:57,584
...but I had an ideal.

1063
01:37:59,504 --> 01:38:02,089
I've known many men, Karl.

1064
01:38:02,882 --> 01:38:05,092
I won't deny that.

1065
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:10,931
But I never thought I would meet one
that I could be proud of.

1066
01:38:12,559 --> 01:38:14,894
Now I've found him.

1067
01:38:16,062 --> 01:38:21,567
Don't confuse sincerity of purpose
with success.

1068
01:38:22,444 --> 01:38:26,781
There's still 15,000 miles
to the flag stead light.

1069
01:38:26,948 --> 01:38:29,492
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, darling.

1070
01:38:29,659 --> 01:38:32,745
The consul has orders
that I should stay here.

1071
01:38:32,912 --> 01:38:35,247
But why must you try to go on?

1072
01:38:35,415 --> 01:38:37,500
You've done the impossible.

1073
01:38:37,667 --> 01:38:42,755
No one would think less of you now
if you accepted internment.

1074
01:38:43,381 --> 01:38:46,008
Oh, please, Karl, give it up.

1075
01:38:49,554 --> 01:38:51,305
Elsa...

1076
01:38:52,223 --> 01:38:54,308
...you call it an illusion.

1077
01:38:54,476 --> 01:38:58,354
Perhaps it is, but it's part of me.

1078
01:38:58,521 --> 01:39:02,441
I may fail, but I can't quit.

1079
01:39:04,569 --> 01:39:06,362
Hold me.

1080
01:39:08,114 --> 01:39:09,949
Tell me.

1081
01:39:11,659 --> 01:39:13,369
Tell me.

1082
01:39:15,372 --> 01:39:17,665
I love you.

1083
01:39:27,759 --> 01:39:30,178
With the scarcity of shipping
in this area...

1084
01:39:30,345 --> 01:39:33,514
...I don't think we can get in trouble
until we reach here.

1085
01:39:33,682 --> 01:39:36,142
You've said nothing about Elsa.

1086
01:39:36,893 --> 01:39:39,729
Elsa remains ashore.
How about supplies?

1087
01:39:39,896 --> 01:39:43,024
Everything's onboard, sir,
including ample fuel.

1088
01:39:43,191 --> 01:39:46,652
- Of course, our main worry...
- Is the men.

1089
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:50,532
Some of them won't return to the ship,
and I can't say I blame them.

1090
01:39:50,699 --> 01:39:52,033
They'll all be here, sir.

1091
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:54,785
- Everybody's onboard, sir.
- Everybody, sir.

1092
01:39:54,953 --> 01:39:58,706
Good. Thank them for me, will you?

1093
01:39:58,873 --> 01:40:01,292
No, I'll go below
and thank them myself.

1094
01:40:01,501 --> 01:40:03,419
- Captain.
- We've got a problem, sir.

1095
01:40:03,586 --> 01:40:05,170
- Trouble ashore?
- Yes, sir.

1096
01:40:05,338 --> 01:40:09,425
Last night we're in the bars and we
run up against some British sailors.

1097
01:40:09,592 --> 01:40:10,926
- A fight?
- No, sir.

1098
01:40:11,094 --> 01:40:13,096
- They seemed decent.
- A lot like us.

1099
01:40:13,263 --> 01:40:15,181
So we decided to have a contest.

1100
01:40:15,348 --> 01:40:17,016
- Drinking?
- Well, sort of, sir.

1101
01:40:17,183 --> 01:40:19,268
They promised to bring us back, sir.

1102
01:40:19,436 --> 01:40:21,479
And that's the last thing I remember.

1103
01:40:21,646 --> 01:40:23,189
But the problem is, sir:

1104
01:40:23,356 --> 01:40:26,359
How do you get rid of a tattoo?

1105
01:40:27,027 --> 01:40:30,280
- Looks like it's been there a long time.
- Not that one, sir.

1106
01:40:30,447 --> 01:40:32,365
Turn around.

1107
01:40:36,202 --> 01:40:37,411
This one, sir.

1108
01:40:39,748 --> 01:40:43,001
"Britannia rules the waves."

1109
01:40:44,919 --> 01:40:47,463
<i>We maintained our blockade</i>
<i>at the harbor...</i>

1110
01:40:47,630 --> 01:40:51,300
<i>... and no cat ever watched</i>
<i>a mouse hole more intently.</i>

1111
01:40:51,468 --> 01:40:54,053
<i>Would Ehrlich chance it</i>
<i>or wouldn 't he?</i>

1112
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:56,555
<i>It was becoming</i>
<i>an international thriller...</i>

1113
01:40:56,723 --> 01:41:00,226
<i>... with sympathy running,</i>
<i>as it always does, to the underdog.</i>

1114
01:41:00,435 --> 01:41:03,604
<i>And the dog</i>
<i>was about to have his day.</i>

1115
01:41:03,772 --> 01:41:05,231
Number One!

1116
01:41:05,398 --> 01:41:08,401
- Sir?
- We're going to have more exciting duty.

1117
01:41:08,568 --> 01:41:12,613
Our cruisers <i>Ajax</i>, <i>Achilles</i> and <i>Exeter</i>
are in action off of Uruguay...

1118
01:41:12,781 --> 01:41:16,409
...against the <i>Graf Spee</i>.
We are ordered to proceed at once.

1119
01:41:16,576 --> 01:41:18,286
What about the <i>Ergenstrasse</i>?

1120
01:41:18,787 --> 01:41:23,333
Where's your sense of proportion, man?
A battleship is worth 10 tramp steamers.

1121
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:25,335
Yes, but not 10 Ehrlichs, sir.

1122
01:41:25,502 --> 01:41:29,380
Napier, you're making this altogether
too much of a personal vendetta.

1123
01:41:29,547 --> 01:41:32,591
Then perhaps you'd endorse
my request for a transfer...

1124
01:41:32,759 --> 01:41:34,635
...to the North Sea patrol.

1125
01:41:34,803 --> 01:41:38,515
- He's gotta come through there.
- I'll see that you are accommodated.

1126
01:41:38,682 --> 01:41:42,060
Now, if you don't mind,
I have my ship to look after.

1127
01:41:52,529 --> 01:41:56,658
The lights of Valparaiso
are still astern, Mr. Bachman.

1128
01:41:57,659 --> 01:42:01,454
Any further instructions
for the night-order book, sir?

1129
01:42:01,621 --> 01:42:05,708
No further instructions
for the night-order book, Mr. Kirchner.

1130
01:42:05,875 --> 01:42:09,003
Just keep to your quarters
when not on duty.

1131
01:42:33,361 --> 01:42:35,446
No premonition this time?

1132
01:42:39,826 --> 01:42:42,036
For better or for worse.

1133
01:42:47,208 --> 01:42:50,044
<i>While the</i> Rockhampton <i>headed</i>
<i>for the</i> Graf Spee...

1134
01:42:50,211 --> 01:42:53,005
<i>... I was in an airplane</i>
<i>bound for England.</i>

1135
01:42:53,173 --> 01:42:55,925
<i>But Karl Ehrlich,</i>
<i>through the fortunes of war...</i>

1136
01:42:56,092 --> 01:42:58,594
<i>... had once more gained valuable time.</i>

1137
01:42:58,762 --> 01:43:01,097
<i>He was still beating the sea and us.</i>

1138
01:43:01,264 --> 01:43:05,393
<i>Still sailing homeward</i>
<i>against almost impossible odds.</i>

1139
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:09,063
<i>His obsession had made a new crew</i>
<i>of the men of the</i> Ergenstrasse.

1140
01:43:09,230 --> 01:43:13,525
<i>And in spite of my hatred for the man,</i>
<i>I felt a certain ironic admiration...</i>

1141
01:43:13,693 --> 01:43:17,363
<i>... for the captain who had welded</i>
<i>the steel of his own character...</i>

1142
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:20,115
<i>... into that plodding heap</i>
<i>of scrap iron.</i>

1143
01:43:20,825 --> 01:43:23,994
<i>Fed and rested,</i>
<i>she beat her way up the Atlantic.</i>

1144
01:43:24,162 --> 01:43:28,291
<i>Her belly was full now of all</i>
<i>necessary coal and provisions...</i>

1145
01:43:28,458 --> 01:43:31,627
<i>... and new lifeboats</i>
<i>hung from her davits.</i>

1146
01:43:31,795 --> 01:43:35,673
<i>The storms threatened her,</i>
<i>yet in a way they aided her...</i>

1147
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:38,592
<i>... by hiding her in their turbulence.</i>

1148
01:43:38,843 --> 01:43:41,762
<i>A little ship unnoticed</i>
<i>in a big ocean...</i>

1149
01:43:41,930 --> 01:43:45,975
<i>... battling and staggering</i>
<i>under the fury of the elements.</i>

1150
01:43:51,189 --> 01:43:55,526
<i>As I waited for her in the North Sea</i>
<i>at the crossroads of the war...</i>

1151
01:43:55,694 --> 01:44:00,115
<i>... I hoped desperately that no other force</i>
<i>would rob me of my quarry.</i>

1152
01:44:00,323 --> 01:44:03,409
<i>And I was alert day and night</i>
<i>for any report...</i>

1153
01:44:03,576 --> 01:44:06,537
<i>... which might be received in London.</i>

1154
01:44:08,581 --> 01:44:10,040
<i>This is Berlin calling...</i>

1155
01:44:10,208 --> 01:44:14,545
<i>... and here again is Lord Haw-Haw at the</i>
<i>microphone of our shortwave station...</i>

1156
01:44:14,713 --> 01:44:16,548
<i>... speaking to England.</i>

1157
01:44:16,715 --> 01:44:20,176
<i>We've all heard of the</i> Ergenstrasse <i>'s</i>
<i>game of hide-and-seek...</i>

1158
01:44:20,343 --> 01:44:22,011
<i>... with the Royal Navy.</i>

1159
01:44:22,178 --> 01:44:26,599
<i>It's been most amusing to report the</i>
<i>bungling British attempts to capture her.</i>

1160
01:44:26,766 --> 01:44:29,560
<i>We're therefore going to lend them</i>
<i>a helping hand.</i>

1161
01:44:29,728 --> 01:44:34,023
<i>Some enlightening clues to the evasive</i>
Ergenstrasse <i>'s whereabouts.</i>

1162
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:37,651
<i>Of course, from their former record,</i>
<i>it'll do them little good.</i>

1163
01:44:37,819 --> 01:44:40,029
<i>Are you ready, admiralty?</i>

1164
01:44:40,238 --> 01:44:43,991
<i>The</i> Ergenstrasse <i>is now proceeding</i>
<i>along the coast of Norway...</i>

1165
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:46,995
<i>... at a present speed</i>
<i>of about 5 knots.</i>

1166
01:44:47,162 --> 01:44:51,708
<i>At this moment, she should be</i>
<i>off the mouth of Korsfjord.</i>

1167
01:44:56,671 --> 01:44:58,547
Captain!

1168
01:45:04,095 --> 01:45:07,515
<i>The Nazis had made a decoy</i>
<i>of the</i> Ergenstrasse.

1169
01:45:07,682 --> 01:45:10,017
<i>Karl Ehrlich, on the brink</i>
<i>of fulfillment...</i>

1170
01:45:10,185 --> 01:45:14,230
<i>... had been betrayed by the new party</i>
<i>to which everything was expendable.</i>

1171
01:45:14,397 --> 01:45:17,274
<i>It must have been a shock,</i>
<i>but no surprise to him...</i>

1172
01:45:17,442 --> 01:45:19,986
<i>... because it didn 't alter</i>
<i>his determination.</i>

1173
01:45:20,153 --> 01:45:23,322
Tell the engine room to cut down
on the smoke, Mr. Bachman.

1174
01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:25,074
Aye, aye, sir.

1175
01:45:25,283 --> 01:45:29,203
Yes, I've read that monitored report
of Lord Haw-Haw's broadcast.

1176
01:45:29,371 --> 01:45:31,706
They're inviting us
to send out heavy ships.

1177
01:45:31,873 --> 01:45:34,083
Ships that we need badly.

1178
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:36,877
Give their air force a field day.

1179
01:45:37,045 --> 01:45:41,549
- A stupid invitation we won't accept.
- Thank you, sir.

1180
01:45:41,716 --> 01:45:44,719
I know I'm violating procedure,
coming directly to you...

1181
01:45:44,886 --> 01:45:47,889
...but this has become an issue
that I can't put aside.

1182
01:45:48,056 --> 01:45:49,932
How does your crew feel about it?

1183
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:53,269
Same as I do, sir.
They're all volunteers.

1184
01:45:54,145 --> 01:45:58,691
If I consent, where do you propose
intercepting your friend?

1185
01:45:59,442 --> 01:46:01,402
Thank you, sir.

1186
01:46:05,365 --> 01:46:08,701
I believe somewhere in here.

1187
01:46:24,968 --> 01:46:29,138
Elsa, how long
have we known each other?

1188
01:46:29,305 --> 01:46:32,182
I've known you since that day
on the island.

1189
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:36,687
When I was driving this crew
24 hours a day?

1190
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:38,982
At the grave.

1191
01:46:40,525 --> 01:46:43,069
That's a long time ago.

1192
01:46:43,361 --> 01:46:47,907
When you said,
"They were good men. Seamen."

1193
01:46:48,491 --> 01:46:50,701
That they were.

1194
01:46:51,453 --> 01:46:55,081
Well, it's a poor reward,
a forgotten grave.

1195
01:46:55,248 --> 01:46:57,208
Not forgotten.

1196
01:46:57,375 --> 01:47:00,795
Immortality has nothing
to do with fame.

1197
01:47:00,962 --> 01:47:05,049
Come on outside,
I have a present for you.

1198
01:47:19,189 --> 01:47:21,774
That's the Norwegian coast.

1199
01:47:22,359 --> 01:47:25,653
Karl, you've kept another promise.

1200
01:47:25,820 --> 01:47:29,365
Perhaps your greatest.
You brought your men home.

1201
01:47:29,532 --> 01:47:34,203
- And to all that it means to them.
- And all that it means to them.

1202
01:47:35,455 --> 01:47:37,957
We'd better get out of the weather.

1203
01:47:47,425 --> 01:47:50,511
It means happiness and home
for everyone else onboard...

1204
01:47:50,679 --> 01:47:52,180
...but what about us?

1205
01:47:52,347 --> 01:47:55,933
What about you?
Arrest, imprisonment?

1206
01:47:56,101 --> 01:47:58,895
Probably. But we'll face that
when we come to it.

1207
01:47:59,062 --> 01:48:02,482
Let's face it now.
This is a neutral coast.

1208
01:48:02,649 --> 01:48:05,526
Why can't we land here
and let the men go on?

1209
01:48:05,694 --> 01:48:08,363
Elsa, you're asking the captain
to leave his ship?

1210
01:48:08,530 --> 01:48:11,074
Captain! Captain!

1211
01:48:13,576 --> 01:48:17,580
Ship off the starboard quarter, sir,
showing no lights.

1212
01:48:31,970 --> 01:48:35,056
Bearing red 10, sir.

1213
01:48:41,479 --> 01:48:43,147
Put a shot across her bows.

1214
01:48:43,732 --> 01:48:45,275
Let this go over her.

1215
01:48:52,907 --> 01:48:55,034
Stop engine.

1216
01:48:57,662 --> 01:49:00,831
Pass the word to abandon ship.

1217
01:49:02,584 --> 01:49:04,335
Move!

1218
01:49:12,802 --> 01:49:15,679
- <i>Engine room.</i>
- Schmitt, we will follow the plan.

1219
01:49:23,271 --> 01:49:25,564
Everybody out!

1220
01:49:26,024 --> 01:49:28,359
Clear the bridge.

1221
01:49:29,527 --> 01:49:31,904
When she loses steerageway,
get to the boat.

1222
01:49:32,072 --> 01:49:33,239
Aye, aye, sir.

1223
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:46,294
She's losing headway, sir.

1224
01:49:46,878 --> 01:49:50,381
Lot of activity on the boat deck.
Might be some sort of trick.

1225
01:49:50,548 --> 01:49:52,675
Well, we'll see.

1226
01:49:55,178 --> 01:50:00,516
Elsa, this is our log.
Make sure it gets to Jeff Napier.

1227
01:50:00,684 --> 01:50:03,061
Schlieter! Hang onto this
for Miss Keller.

1228
01:50:03,228 --> 01:50:06,397
But aren't you coming
on the same boat?

1229
01:50:06,606 --> 01:50:08,441
No.

1230
01:50:10,485 --> 01:50:14,363
- Everything rigged below?
- Yes, but I'm staying with you.

1231
01:50:14,572 --> 01:50:17,992
Chief, I promised you
your grandchildren. Get in that boat.

1232
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:20,578
- But...
- That's an order!

1233
01:50:21,079 --> 01:50:23,247
All right, everyone aboard!

1234
01:50:27,961 --> 01:50:31,589
Mr. Kirchner, report to the bridge.

1235
01:50:43,518 --> 01:50:45,978
Kirchner, you're staying
aboard with me.

1236
01:50:46,146 --> 01:50:48,481
- What?
- You're such a loyal party member...

1237
01:50:48,648 --> 01:50:51,567
...you'll fight for your cause,
while I defend my ship.

1238
01:50:51,735 --> 01:50:53,486
Your ship? You're a lunatic!

1239
01:50:53,653 --> 01:50:55,738
You have no crew,
no armament, no guns.

1240
01:50:55,905 --> 01:50:59,533
- But a propeller. One.
- Now...

1241
01:51:18,053 --> 01:51:20,472
There's no activity onboard
at all now, sir.

1242
01:51:20,638 --> 01:51:22,306
Boats are approaching us, sir.

1243
01:51:35,987 --> 01:51:39,156
Are we going to pick them up?
I don't like the look of it.

1244
01:51:39,449 --> 01:51:42,535
Throw a net over the side.
Prepare to take them onboard.

1245
01:51:42,702 --> 01:51:45,579
- Yes, sir.
- Bring the captain to me.

1246
01:52:48,685 --> 01:52:51,979
Here's our log.
Take it to your captain.

1247
01:52:59,404 --> 01:53:02,657
We have the survivors onboard.
The captain isn't with them.

1248
01:53:02,824 --> 01:53:04,575
This is their log.

1249
01:53:06,161 --> 01:53:08,413
They're changing course, sir.

1250
01:53:09,497 --> 01:53:12,082
Shall we commence firing, sir?

1251
01:53:12,250 --> 01:53:15,711
- No. Put a star shell over her.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1252
01:53:15,879 --> 01:53:18,590
Put a star shell over her!

1253
01:53:39,944 --> 01:53:41,862
He's making a hoist
from the bridge.

1254
01:53:42,030 --> 01:53:46,659
- What flag is that? It has no swastika.
- The imperial battle flag.

1255
01:53:46,826 --> 01:53:50,120
- He can't be going to engage us, sir?
- He is.

1256
01:53:50,288 --> 01:53:52,456
I think he's gonna try and ram us, sir.

1257
01:53:52,624 --> 01:53:55,376
- Commence firing.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1258
01:53:57,337 --> 01:53:59,797
Commence firing!

1259
01:54:05,512 --> 01:54:08,264
- Up 200.
- Up 200.

1260
01:54:16,231 --> 01:54:18,399
Hit on the well deck, sir.

1261
01:54:31,955 --> 01:54:33,498
Hit on the boat deck, sir.

1262
01:54:47,095 --> 01:54:49,263
You maniac!

1263
01:54:54,728 --> 01:54:58,648
Elsa. Strike that flag!

1264
01:55:19,085 --> 01:55:21,879
Elsa, the lifeboat.

1265
01:55:29,971 --> 01:55:32,515
The boilers are gone, sir.

1266
01:55:39,022 --> 01:55:41,149
Cease fire.

1267
01:55:42,233 --> 01:55:43,400
Cease fire.

1268
01:55:48,907 --> 01:55:53,661
Shall we break radio silence, sir?
Report the taking of the <i>Ergenstrasse</i>?

1269
01:55:56,206 --> 01:55:57,916
No.

1270
01:55:58,750 --> 01:56:01,294
I'll report this in person.

1271
01:56:05,507 --> 01:56:08,134
We'll search for survivors.

1272
01:56:08,885 --> 01:56:12,054
- Slow ahead.
- Slow ahead, sir.

1273
01:56:16,434 --> 01:56:18,144
<i>We searched for survivors...</i>

1274
01:56:18,311 --> 01:56:21,605
<i>... but all that we found</i>
<i>was a riddle of the sea...</i>

1275
01:56:21,773 --> 01:56:25,443
<i>... some tide-swept wreckage</i>
<i>on the nearby beach.</i>

1276
01:56:25,610 --> 01:56:27,903
<i>Had the sea taken them...</i>

1277
01:56:28,071 --> 01:56:32,867
<i>... or had they reached the nearby shore</i>
<i>where the fjords could hide a secret?</i>

1278
01:56:33,034 --> 01:56:34,952
<i>Who can say?</i>

1279
01:56:35,203 --> 01:56:39,081
<i>There are only two people who can</i>
<i>answer that, wherever they are.</i>

1280
01:56:39,249 --> 01:56:44,170
<i>But knowing Karl Ehrlich as I did,</i>
<i>I have my own opinion.</i>

1281
