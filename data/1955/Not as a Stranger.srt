1
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,877
Gentlemen

2
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,636
this is a corpse.

3
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,920
There is a tradition among medical
students that dealing with death humorously

4
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,148
makes things easier .

5
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,714
It doesn't.

6
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,717
There may be a successful Joke about death
in the abstract, but l have never heard it.

7
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,239
About death in the particular,

8
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,797
believe me there is nothing runny at all.

9
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,760
I have been a pathologist for over twenty-five years

10
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,194
I haven't been able to get a
Single laugh out of it yet.

11
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,751
For some of you this will be unpleasant;

12
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,957
for a few, perhaps - perhaps impossible.

13
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,514
Now fix firmly in your heads that
seven hours ago this was a living soul,

14
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,032
housed in an edifice constructed
by a supremely capable Architect.

15
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,999
You are about to violate it.

16
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,080
And when you do,

17
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,880
you will help yourselves
immeasurably as physicians and healers

18
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,556
if you do so - tenderly and with love.

19
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,437
Our purpose here today is to
determine the cause of death.

20
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,999
We will follow the method of Rokitansky,
which is to remove the visceral organs intact .

21
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,760
First, we will make a cruciate incision
from the suprasternal arch to the pubus,

22
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,955
and then, transversely as' well.

23
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,510
Thus!

24
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,680
''Seven hours ago this was a living soul ''

25
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,160
Well, that settles it.
I'm not leaving my body to Science!

26
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,832
You kiddin'? I may not even die!

27
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,391
ThatAarons puts on a
great show though, doesn't he?

28
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,078
Yeah - he doesn't get any laughs, though.

29
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,880
All right! So I'm nervous.

30
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,313
All right. You eating with us, Marsh?

31
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,352
No, I can't. I have to work the Lab tonight.

32
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,680
We got nurses -- we can get one for you.

33
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,875
Pretty? Who cares? They're alive, aren't they?

34
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,113
I'm saving myself until 'the right girl' comes along.

35
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,312
Be home later, Al . See you, Brundage.

36
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,751
It must be tough, living with both Mayo Brothers!

37
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,800
Luke's okay .. Do you know he's got
to clean up the Lab in order to eat?

38
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,917
Yeah .. but even so, y'know, there's
somethin' about him. What does he do for kicks?

39
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,753
He wants to be a doctor.

40
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,640
So what do we want to be? House painters?

41
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,634
He wants it more. A lot more than any of us.

42
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,268
How are you, Kristina?

43
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,670
My feet hurt.

44
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,990
Long operation?

45
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,749
It was a radical neck dissection... four hours.

46
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,880
Why that's not so long. Last week we
did an abdominal -- took over six hours;

47
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,872
we even had to replace the
assistant surgeon, because he ---

48
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,113
Is that your dinner?

49
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,874
Oh, I'm not very hungry.

50
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
You should eat.

51
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,357
You've got a lot to feed there.
I just don 't feel like eating.

52
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,639
Go on - take these. No thanks, Kris..
really... I' m not hungry.

53
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,160
I was looking for you upstairs this morning.

54
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,160
You were?

55
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,639
I'd like to ask you a favour...

56
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,833
You know that laminectomy that
Lettering is doing on Monday?

57
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,550
I wonder if you could fix it
for Alfred and me to watch ..

58
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,997
Well ... I'm really not supposed to do that.

59
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,160
Miss Hedwigson, report to Surgery B please!

60
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,038
Miss Hedwigson, report to Surgery B please!

61
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,589
It'll be alright for Monday. I'll fix it. Thanks, Kris.

62
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,191
All right - I'll ask. What happened?

63
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,713
Nothing. Nothing? Atiger like you?

64
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,957
This kid's very sick. She needs a lot of help.,

65
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,954
She's got an absolute obsession about virtue!

66
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,032
You mean she didn't go for you? Eh?

67
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,918
I think she's hyper-thyroid.

68
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,160
Well, there's plenty more fish in the sea.

69
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,594
Yeah - but this fish cost me
eighteen bucks in a night -club.

70
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,790
What is that?

71
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,280
Todd and Sanford - ''Laboratory Diagnosis''.

72
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,158
Oh yeah. I bought a synopsis today
from Brundage. I'll lend it to you.

73
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,119
You can't learn about blood
tests from an outline, Al.

74
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,872
If you don't watch it they're gonna drop you.

75
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,639
Yes, Dad...

76
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,397
Oh - you short of money again, Luke?

77
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,230
Why? From the Bursar.

78
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,390
What is it?

79
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,349
Trouble.

80
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,996
I'll have to see my father.

81
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,159
What did you do with it?.

82
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,995
Luke, I ...What did you do with the money?

83
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,950
Let me explain, won't ya? Is there any of it left?
Or did you blow it all?

84
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,120
Thatwas my mother's money

85
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,792
things she did without -- for me.

86
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,829
Please, Luke -- please don't

87
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,759
You -- drunk!

88
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,750
I know what I am...

89
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,956
Yes - I - I stole your money.

90
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,915
But l'm not Just an old man
you left alone in this place.

91
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,314
l'm a person -- a human being.

92
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,071
Your mother never understood that,
and you can't understand it.

93
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,234
You won't make it, Luke.

94
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,674
You want to be a doctor.

95
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,868
Ever since you were a kid
you went runnin' after them.

96
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,554
Just to carry their bags.

97
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,470
l'm sorry for you.

98
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,996
l don't think you'll ever make it.

99
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,350
There was something left out of you, Luke.

100
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,191
lt isn't enough to have a brain.

101
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,554
You have to have a heart!

102
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,360
and so please have your reports on the
intermediate enzymes

103
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,873
on my desk by tomorrow morning.

104
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,119
That will be all fortoday, gentlemen .

105
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,030
Hey, Al .

106
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,600
Yeah. Did you remember those slides?
l'd like to get 'em back.

107
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,830
l'll clean 'em up for you and
get 'em to you this afternoon. Allright.

108
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,758
Where you been? You missed three classes.

109
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,879
l've been trying to raise money.
l l'm out on my ear Monday.

110
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,388
Did you see your father? Forget it.

111
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,680
Oh... hey, how about the scholarship fund.
They've got dough in their..

112
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,353
l've been there. They only take
fourth-year men. l've been everyplace.

113
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,394
l got my allowance today. Here - take it.

114
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,160
lt won't help, Al. l need four hundred!

115
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,559
Take it. lt's a start.

116
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,070
Al!

117
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,233
Stop it, will ya? So for a
month l'll eat in the cafeteria.

118
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,080
You better hurry or you'll be late or class.

119
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,990
l'll see you.

120
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,917
Hey, Al...Yeah?

121
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,039
Could you ask your father?

122
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,189
Sure - l could ask him.

123
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,235
You know what he'd say?

124
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,878
He's the cliche expert of all time.

125
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,516
He'd say, ''My boy, you
know money don't grow on trees

126
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,434
the root of all evil -- lend a dollar; loose a friend

127
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,556
And besides, he hasn't got it...honest.

128
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,988
Go on - you'll be late.

129
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,760
Why me? Why'd you come to me?

130
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,560
You got me my job in the Lab,
you've encouraged me...

131
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,880
and you know l'll make a doctor.

132
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,235
Have you any idea of the kind of money l make?

133
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,160
l figure around eight - nine thousand.

134
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,120
That's exactly right.
And l've got three children, too.

135
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,360
They're going to throw me out.

136
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,715
Can't you at least get me
an advance on my salary?

137
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,280
l have no control over that.

138
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,640
Even if l did, how would you eat?

139
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,756
l don't know. l don't care.
But l have to have the money.

140
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,480
All right! Quit school,
go to work, come back again next year.

141
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,789
l can't waste a whole year.
l can't do anything else. l...

142
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,120
l just can't! Of course you can!

143
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,430
This isn' t the end of the world.
You're - you're over-reacting.

144
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,791
Marsh, you're wallowing in self-pity.

145
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
l want to tell you something.
l was a promising student, too.

146
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,468
l had to face the same problems
you're facing now - and a lot more.

147
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,554
You're not a jew.

148
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,440
l'm part of the five-percent they let in here

149
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,271
because they were ashamed
to keep us out entirely.

150
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,912
Now you've got me wallowing ..

151
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Haven't you got a family?

152
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,349
Just my father.

153
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,432
Can't he help? He's a drunk.

154
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,718
All right- here's seventy-five dollars.
lt's all l can afford.

155
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,756
Give it to the Bursar on Monday.
Tell him you're going to hold up a gas station.

156
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,360
Pull out all the stops, lie to him!

157
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,920
Tell him anything. Get him to give you more time.

158
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,630
Here!

159
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,034
Sir - l don't know what to say.

160
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,474
l have a class.

161
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,709
This isn't a state institution.
We have to be very business-like about this.

162
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,635
l have to be very business-like about it.

163
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,480
Now l'll accept this payment,

164
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,519
but unless you have the balance in 30 days,
you won't be permitted to attend classes.

165
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,790
Yes, sir.

166
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,030
Marsh ...

167
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,158
do you think you can get it?.

168
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,550
l'll get it.

169
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,040
l was afraid you wouldn't get here.
How'd you make out?

170
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,237
l've got a thirty-day extension.
Then the rest of the money - or l' m out.

171
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,196
Okay -- now relax. She
arranged this for you, you know.

172
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,110
Gentlemen.

173
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,957
if we can remove the tumor
without injury to the spinal cord,

174
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,552
the patient may be able to walk again.

175
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,678
First operation? No, sir.

176
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,479
Used to it? Almost.

177
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,478
lf you faint, faint backwards.

178
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,510
He's not deep yet, is he? No, he isn't, Doctor.

179
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,589
Gentlemen, the patient is unconscious,

180
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,430
and normally should react to stimuli.
Sterile pin!

181
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,350
Miss Hagen?

182
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,711
Absolutely no response.

183
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,032
Now let's see whatwe can do.

184
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,555
Towel clips ....

185
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,840
Deeper!

186
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,750
Yes, sir.

187
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,109
Knife please.

188
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,630
Come over here, gentlemen, where you can see.

189
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,912
We'll make a vertical mid-line-incision.

190
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,915
That's it!

191
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,988
Put the dressings on. ls he light?

192
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,039
Stage two, Doctor. l want him almost awake.

193
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,388
Anatomically the operation was a success .

194
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,154
Now let's see if we've helped the patient.

195
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,640
Not too tight with that tape. How's the pressure?

196
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,198
120 over 80. Good.

197
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,756
High drama, ey gentlemen?
Men in white, acting swiftly against death,

198
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,919
flashing knives, flowing blood, mystery...
just like on television.

199
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,037
Don't be seduced by it. lt's mechanic's work.

200
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,554
A hundred years ago itwas
the physician who was important.

201
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,190
Surgery was left to the barbers.

202
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,318
He doesn' t mean a word of it.

203
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,513
You like Smorgasbord?

204
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,314
Not any more.

205
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,680
Next Saturday, at my friend Bruni's house,
l'm going to fix a big one.

206
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,511
You want to come? We'd love to come.

207
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,996
Saturday. Eight o'clock.

208
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,154
l'll meet you in front of the nurses dormitory.

209
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,754
You might regret this.

210
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,838
Now why shouldn't we be polite to her?
She did us a favor.

211
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,676
Don't say l didn'twarn you.
She looked at you like you were Smorgasbord .

212
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,276
Luke, are you sure l can't get
you something else? No, thanks.

213
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,113
No, thank you. l pass ..

214
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,237
l was thinking - couple smart
young doctors like you

215
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,800
maybe you could tell me?

216
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,076
At night l fall asleep,
dead to the world, just like a log.

217
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,514
And in the afternoon - after lunch - l feel so tired,
l'm Just no good for work .

218
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,997
Also - in the morning - l got gas on my stomach ..

219
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,799
Now what do you think is wrong?

220
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,475
l can't imagine.

221
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,872
Yah - well, l can!

222
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,194
Luke - whatwas that funny
joke you was going to tell us?

223
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,269
Yeah, Luke - how about that
funny joke you were going to tell us?

224
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,239
Please tell it, Luke.

225
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,916
Well -there's a honeymoon couple out riding.

226
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,520
The bride's horse rears up
and the husband goes ?over and grabs it

227
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,308
by the bridle and shakes his fist in its face
and says, ''Now that's one!''

228
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,679
What? That's one!

229
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,990
One, Oley...the first time. The first time what?

230
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,077
The first time the horse rears up!

231
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,630
Oley, that isn't the end of the joke!

232
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,319
Go on, Luke.

233
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,120
Well - after a little while the horse rears up again.

234
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,800
The husband goes over and he shakes
his fist in the horse's face again,

235
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,314
and he says: ''That's two ......Good. good.

236
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,789
The third time the horse rears
up the husband pulls out a big gun

237
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,316
Yah - a horse pistol.

238
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,069
Yah

239
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,200
He shoots the horse dead.
The wife says: ''Now why did you do that?

240
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,320
Killing a poor, dumb animal like that?''

241
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,313
The husband turns around. He looks her
right in the eye and he says: That's one!

242
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,480
You see, he warns his horse and then he shot him,

243
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,835
so now he warns his new wife in the same way.

244
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,589
Yah. Yah ... that's pretty funny!

245
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,315
Er - how about some more herring, Luke?

246
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,829
You like Svenskafood, Luke? Yeah.

247
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,473
Kristi fixed it.
All last night early this morning she worked.

248
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,796
She cooks good, hah? Wonderful .

249
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,590
She sews good, too. That dress - she made it.

250
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,599
Even her underwear she makes sometimes.

251
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,518
Believe me, she's got what it takes
to make some man a good...Bruni!

252
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,110
And a man would know where the money goes to.

253
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,240
And you know what she does?

254
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,109
Every month at least half her salary into the bank.
Please, Bruni!

255
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,395
How much you got now, Kristi?
Three-four thousand dollars, l think.

256
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,593
Kristi, you don't have to do that now.
We got plenty of time.

257
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,678
Hello - Mr. Revere, please.

258
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,155
Mr. Revere, this is Mr. Marsh.
How are we doing on that loan application?

259
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,514
Look, if l had a car and a hundred dollars a week,
would l be calling you ?

260
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,429
Okay - goodbye.

261
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,198
Do you mind if l walk with you?
No. Where're you going? Administration.

262
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,632
All right -- what's so funny?

263
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,115
You and that one with the horse's tail. O, what do
you know .. And a couple of others l've heard.

264
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,120
l worked in a hospital once where a student

265
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,476
copied the whole list of
seventy-five nurses from Ato Z.

266
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,836
He bet he could do it alphabetically.

267
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,354
Well, and what happened?

268
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,156
He flunked outwhile he was still in the ''G's''.

269
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,439
l .. eh. .. l wanted to thank you for the other night .

270
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,038
Oh, that's all right. No - l really mean it.
l had a wonderful time.

271
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,597
l thought, maybe, you'd have dinner with me.

272
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:24,999
Look - l know itwas pretty terrible.
They stuffed you 'til you could hardly move.

273
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,835
They bored you to death.
They didn't even laugh at your jokes.

274
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,040
Believe me, you don't have to take me to dinner.

275
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,679
But l want to take you to dinner.

276
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,152
You're taking a chance. You might be bored again.

277
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,711
You won't bore me.

278
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,030
Feel like something to eat?
No - let's walk a while. All right.

279
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,318
What are you thinking about?.

280
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,640
When l was small, l used to hate women like that.

281
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
Like what?

282
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,880
That girl in the movie. l used to think itwasn't fair.

283
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,758
lf things were arranged right
all women would be that pretty.

284
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,595
Well you're pretty, you've got a nice figure. Oh?

285
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,880
You know what l mean ...
you - you're put together right.

286
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,670
Everything fits - the way you move -
the way you walk - even the way you talk.

287
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,878
The other nurses call me
''The Swedish Nightingale''.

288
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,231
How did you ever happen to take up nursing?

289
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:04,552
Oh - l was six years old -and
l saw a nurse in a blue cape.

290
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,989
And l made up my mind right then.

291
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,676
So now l'm a nurse, but l still talk like Minnesota.

292
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,999
Well l like it and l'm not bored.

293
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,993
Aren't you? No, l'm not.

294
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,514
l thought you liked me, Kris. l'm not Dorothy, Luke.

295
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,836
Well now what's she got to do with it?

296
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,118
Oh, she goes out with the students all the time.

297
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,793
l'm not like that. l'm not
being catty - they don't ask me.

298
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,080
l'm Just not sexy the way she is.

299
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,311
You don't know what you are
- so stop talking like that.

300
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,677
What do you want with me?

301
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:55,355
Kris - l enjoy being with you... l like you.

302
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:02,432
l want to see you often. Luke .. l mean it. Okay?

303
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,829
All right.

304
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,715
And you don't have to run yourself into
the ground anymore, so you can cut that out.

305
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,108
l said all right.

306
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,551
Well, all right.

307
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,116
...<i>and his right eye is swelling</i>.

308
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,150
How often you see him? Who ? Who - she asks!

309
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,191
Three - four times. Since last Saturday? Uhm.

310
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,397
What do you do? We walk - talk. That's all?

311
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,753
He kisses you?

312
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,873
Well??

313
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,913
A little.

314
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,356
You like him, Kristi?

315
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,117
Oh Bruni, l love him - l loved him right away.

316
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,193
Weeks ago in the hospital when l first saw him.

317
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,753
And l don't know what to do. Do? Love him.

318
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,471
You don't understand, Bruni.
He wants to be a doctor!

319
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,634
Everything else is nothing next to that

320
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,433
Maybe that's why l love him so much.

321
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,274
Now what can l tell you you don't know yourself?

322
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,513
lf you find out he doesn't love you, don't see him.

323
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,112
But if he does, then what happens happens.

324
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,270
But - but l want ....You wantwhat all
women want. So l wanted.

325
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,589
So l got. . . . Oley, turn that thing down!

326
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,117
Cheer up, Kristi! Everything works out.

327
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,909
Yah - cheer up, Kristi! Everything works out ...

328
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,160
What is it Luke?

329
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,840
Mmmm? What do you mean?

330
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,195
Something's been bothering
you all evening. What is it?

331
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,869
Oh, just thinking ...

332
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,838
Kris, l've been trying to find a
right way to say this - or the right time.

333
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,708
Look, l love you, Kris.

334
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,838
l don't know when it happened,
or how - but l love you.

335
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,669
Now don't say any of those things about
students and nurses, or how bored l'll be

336
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,556
l wasn't going to,Luke.
Just tell me, tell me how you feel.

337
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,874
No .. l can't. Yes, you can.
Tell me. l can't. l don't know.

338
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,554
Do you know if you love me?

339
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,957
Of course l love you. l thought you knew.
l thought everyone knew. Can't you see it?

340
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,311
l loved you before you spoke two words to me.

341
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,992
That's what l wanted to hear.
And l want you to marry me.

342
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,875
But- right now l'm in such an awful mess,
l just don't know.

343
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,995
What is it? What mess?
They're gonna throw me out of school.

344
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,392
Have you done something wrong?
No. Well then - why?

345
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,320
Well - my tuition isn't paid
and l don't have any money.

346
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,639
Oh - is that all?

347
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,917
All? Only money?

348
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,392
l thought you'd done something wrong.
That you were in real trouble .

349
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,430
But they 're gonna throw me out!
Of course they 're not.. l have money.

350
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,635
You? Me. You heard Bruni the other night.
Well, it's true. l got plenty in the bank.

351
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,639
Oh, no ... Why not? Because it's yours!

352
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,393
You're so silly sometimes, Luke ... so proud.

353
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,556
Listen to me, Luke - and don't argue about it.

354
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:28,237
l love you so much ... l love you!
lt's my right to help you.

355
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,510
Kris ..

356
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,754
What's with you, Luke?

357
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,511
Three o'clock on a week night?

358
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,678
You're gonna have to get another roommate, Al.

359
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,428
Oh, cut it out!
You'll come up with the money somehow.

360
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,631
Tomorrow l'm getting married.

361
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,314
You're what? Getting married!

362
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,150
You're crazy. You can't...
Haven't you got enough trouble as it is?

363
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,275
Married to whom? Kristina.

364
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,155
Hedvigson? The OR? That's right.

365
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,720
Have you flipped your lid or somethin'?
l know what l'm doing.

366
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,473
You don't know what you're doin'.
This is not the kind of a dame you marry!

367
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,237
l'm marrying her!

368
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,872
Look -A Doctor's wife gets him patients.

369
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,232
She went to the right school -
her folks belong to the right country club.

370
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,760
She's charming. She was brought up that way.
This dame ought to marry a farmer!

371
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,070
Are you finished?
Don't l make any sense with you at all?

372
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,472
Oh, l get it ... you're doin' this to stay in school!

373
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,440
You're marrying her for her
money to pay for your tuition!

374
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,671
She's payin' for it, isn't she?
Well, isn't she?

375
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,590
Yes, she is.

376
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,480
Y'know the thing that kills me about you idealists,
is just how far you'll go.

377
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,040
l'm supposed to be the cynical type
but l could never do a thing like this.

378
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,720
Well, you've got a father to pay your way!

379
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,080
All right, then. You need the money -
take the money and blow.

380
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,320
Why do you have to marry her?

381
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,280
That's not the way it is, Al.
l want to marry her. lt's my part of the bargain.

382
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,600
You're cheatin' her right from the start, Luke.
You don't even love her.

383
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,120
Well she'll never know. She'll never find out.

384
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,920
l think it's a dirty, stinking, lousy thing to do.

385
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,390
You're taking advantage of a poor
square-head who's afraid of being an old maid.

386
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,472
You're lettin' yourself be kept!

387
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,875
l'm sorry. l'm sorry l said that.

388
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,909
You all right? Yeah - l'm all right.

389
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,870
Real civilized .... Doctors of medicine

390
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,551
What ... ? l was going to ask you to be best man.

391
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,549
Okay... l'm it, then.

392
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,393
lt's not all the way it sounds, Al - she's

393
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,556
well - nothing is just black or white

394
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,879
l know.

395
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,151
Goodnight, Luke.

396
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,440
Well, here we are! Yeah - here we are ..

397
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,352
And l imagine the neighbors know
that we've arrived, too.

398
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,670
Well - good night, Al. Good night, you two.
See you in the morning at eight.

399
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,636
A.M! Okay, Al. Don't forget to
look in the ice-box! Thanks, Oley.

400
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,158
Oh, my little darling!

401
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,674
Do you like it, Luke? Yeah - it's nice.

402
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,117
Oh, the kitchen's small,
but l found a place for everything.

403
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,435
And... l changed the bedroom around.

404
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,238
l think you've done a wonderful Job.
What's that on the pillow?

405
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,910
Oh - that's evergreen. ln the old country
they say that makes the babies healthy.

406
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,590
Olie and Bruni must have done it.

407
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,829
l wonder what Oley meant about the lce-box?
l'll go take a look.

408
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,789
Champagne! Oh - that was really sweet of them!

409
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,639
We probably don't have any champagne glasses.

410
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,909
l hope it tastes all right in these.

411
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,593
Do you feel different, Luke?

412
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,477
Different? l mean - do you feel married?

413
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,589
Sure l do.

414
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,673
l keep trying to realize it's really true.

415
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,357
lt is true. You're not sorry, are you, Luke?

416
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,079
Ha - of course not!

417
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,712
l guess every woman asks her
husband that in her wedding night.

418
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,871
You drink your champagne.

419
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:38,155
Oh, Luke - l love you . l love you so much.

420
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,553
l love you, Kris...

421
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,711
We have here a patient who swallowed his watch
and we got to find out what is ticking.

422
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,597
Scalpel, please! Ooh! A light one!

423
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,193
And now ve make a simple
incision from the xyphoid to the pubus

424
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,955
and then - sideways. Thus !

425
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,638
Now we take out the intestines.

426
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,670
He's a long fellow .. long fellow,

427
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,957
and we look at all the areas
to be sure we find the watch.

428
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,192
Two more seconds ... Ah-ha !

429
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,476
Such a cheap watch ... four seconds slow !

430
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,879
Okay, now we - we lock him up here.
We put all the intestines back again.

431
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,515
We got to get everything
put back in the right place.

432
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,956
We got to be very gentle
here with the patient, you know.

433
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,030
Thank you, Doctor.

434
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,870
Now that you have entered your
second year of medical school,

435
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,753
l had hoped that the humorous aspects
of surgery might have been exhausted.

436
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,828
lf you don't mind, gentlemen, l'll take over.
First slide, please.

437
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,233
Leukoplakia - this is the most
common danger signal of oral cancer.

438
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,397
Now when you see this, it is time

439
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,228
that is... it is sometimes time
to check for a consistent irritant.

440
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,320
Now this slide may one day help
you to save a life ... Remember it.

441
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,869
Use your microscopes. Study this series well.
There'll be no time for review.

442
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,428
Next slide, please!

443
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,997
They really throw it at you. Relax.
They only expect you to learn seventy percent.

444
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,830
Kill the slide!

445
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,070
Open it!

446
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,192
What page? Any page.

447
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,917
91 7? Subject? The abducent nerve.

448
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,754
The abducent nerve...

449
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,876
The abducent nerve. The abducent nerve.

450
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,588
The abducent nerve supplies
the rectus lateralis oculi.

451
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,120
lts fibers arise in the upper part of the
rhomboid fossa beneath the colliculus facialis.

452
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,720
They pass downward through the pons and
emerge in the furrow between the lower border

453
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,080
of the pons and the upper end of
the pyramid of the medulla oblongata.

454
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,991
The nerve pierces the dura mater.
ls that verbatim?

455
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,270
Just about, Sir. All right.

456
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,233
To graduate in medicine you will memorize
fifteen thousand pages exactly like that.

457
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:56,236
Gentlemen, if there is a single description
of a doctor, it is this: a doctor is memory!

458
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,000
Now the survivors of this course will
be members of the only group in modern society

459
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,514
privileged to commit manslaughter
with immunity from the law.

460
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,749
Therefore you will learn everything!
Not seventy percent - but everything!

461
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,432
Otherwise you will be dropped.

462
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,633
That will be all for today, gentlemen.

463
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,279
Anybody for law school?

464
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,520
Yeah - ''not seventy percent - but everything''!

465
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,080
What's he trying to do?
Scare us to death with that manslaughter bit?

466
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,600
l don't know.

467
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,400
He doesn't bother me with that
blood-and-guts stuff. l'm going in for skin.

468
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,240
Yeah? Listen to Boy Doctor :
Your patients never die, they never get well -

469
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,640
and they never get you up at night.

470
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,240
And they don't think skin is serious,
so they never pay their bills.

471
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,480
Obstetrics, that's the racket.
Everybody always pays for their kids!

472
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,080
But you never sleep. No woman ever had a
baby at three o'clock in the afternoon!

473
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,760
Personally l'm for surgery.

474
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,800
l just got a look at Dr. Dietrich's car,
parked outside. You know what he drives?

475
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,400
What? A bentley -- Seventeen thousand bucks.

476
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,675
That guy doesn't take out a
splinter for less than a thousand!

477
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,880
Well, l'll still take ''Ear-nose-and-throat''.

478
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,400
The common cold is the doctor's best friend.
Call it virus - you make more dough.

479
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,800
Now, look - if these kiddies are all through,
your old man here will really wise you up...

480
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,960
lt is notwhat you practice -- it is where!

481
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,120
What do you mean? l've been doing
a little research on this problem.

482
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,640
The average doctor's income is eleven G's,
in the South less - in the West more.

483
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,080
Pebble Beach, Colorado Springs, Beverly Hills ...
That's where the rich are crackin' up fast.

484
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,400
Well you're wasting your time here.
Why don't you both become bookies.

485
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,120
Come on! Hey, you know - l kinda like small town.

486
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,120
Ooh - stay out of them, man.
No neurotics and no dough.

487
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,351
Big cities. Cadillacs.
That's what my old man always says.

488
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,110
lt's just as easy to get up for a fifty
dollar-ulcer as it is to get up for a ten dollar ulcer.

489
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,718
Easier! ln other words -if they haven't
got fifty dollars, you Just let 'em die!

490
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,200
What's the matter, Marsh? Are we upsetting you?

491
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,432
No, you're not upsetting me.
You just make me want to vomit, that's all.

492
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,279
Well? Shall we join Dr. Kildare in surgery?

493
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,434
Closing suture!

494
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,720
l don't get it. Why didn't
Dietrich cut the vagus nerves?

495
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,073
Pipe down, he can hear you.

496
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,433
You can take your retractors out now ....
All right, Doctor - sew him up!

497
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,393
Yes, Sir . 3.0 silk. Yes, Sir.

498
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,792
Note that Dr. Radcliff will suture with extreme care.

499
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,119
This is a ward patient,
and there's no charge, of course.

500
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,394
But from my private patients l get as much
as a thousand dollars for this operation.

501
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,398
Forthat kind of money, gentlemen,
the patient has a right to a handsome scar.

502
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:04,478
As l have explained, the gastro-enterostomy
you have just seen is an operation of choice.

503
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,231
A gastrectomy -orthe
resection of almost the entire stomach

504
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,551
is another means of
dealing with the duodenal ulcer.

505
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,957
lt depends entirely on the individual case.

506
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,998
Now then - are there any questions?

507
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,079
He didn't cut the nerves.
l'm going to ask him. Let it lay, will ya?

508
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:25,950
Yes?

509
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,550
Dr. Dietrich, l noticed that you
did not severthe vagus nerves.

510
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,755
That's correct. l did not.

511
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,640
lsn't it true, Sir, that in this
operation the vagus nerves must be cut

512
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,632
to reduce the acid flow and
prevent the recurrence of ulcers?

513
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,518
What's your name? Marsh, Sir.

514
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,920
Well, Marsh, l've performed this
operation perhaps a hundred times.

515
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,478
l've never cut the vagus nerves.

516
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,832
l know there is some such new theory.
lt is not a theory, Sir.

517
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,116
The clinical evidence was
published over a year ago.

518
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,040
Now look here, Marsh, l have no intention...

519
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,838
Excuse me, Doctor, but may we
clear the instruments? Yes, yes.

520
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,236
You're arrogant, Mr. Marsh, and wrong!

521
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,680
l have the reports, Sir, if you'd care to read them.

522
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,560
When you come to your senses, Marsh,

523
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,518
and realize who you are and where you are,
l'll accept an apology.

524
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,400
How dare you, do anything like that?
Who do you think you are?

525
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,600
Just tell me one thing: He was wrong, wasn't he?

526
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,800
Will you listen to me? You apologize to
Dietrich or you won't be allowed to interne here.

527
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,440
Was he wrong? Yes, he was wrong.

528
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,360
Did you hear what l said? You won't interne here!

529
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,080
All right, then l won't! But l'm not
going to tell Dietrich he was right

530
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,160
when he was wrong
even if l have to go to another hospital.

531
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,197
There won't be a good hospital in the country
open to you. Dietrich's got influence.

532
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,114
Well l can't apologize.

533
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,072
You mean you won't.

534
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,077
All right, then l mean l won't.

535
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,670
Hello, Luke.

536
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,110
Hi.

537
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,270
Dinner'll take about ten minutes. Are you starved?

538
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,750
l'm not hungry.

539
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,990
Good - then l'll sit down for a few minutes.

540
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,594
l'm tired.

541
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,030
Allright. Let's not lead up to it gently.
Let's have it and get it over with.

542
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,874
l don'twant to fight with you, Luke.
Why not?. Everyone else has.

543
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,760
There's nothing for me to say. Dr. Aarons told you.

544
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,432
You mean he told you to work on me.

545
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,678
Well, you're wasting your time.
l'm not going to apologize.

546
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,439
Luke, he's right. They'll stop you from interning.

547
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,316
All right- then let them stop me! l'm sick of it!

548
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,115
Money! That's all they care about. All of them.

549
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:55,235
Brundage, even Al. And that pompous fool
who calls himself a surgeon is the worst.

550
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,560
He can't keep up with the new stuff.
He's too busy collecting thousand-dollar-bills!

551
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,280
l've seen Dietrich operate plenty of times.
He's a good surgeon.

552
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,520
Maybe a little old-fashioned, but..

553
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,920
Can't you understand? Didn't you hear today?

554
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,800
l know, l know. He didn't cut the nerves,

555
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,600
and there's a twenty percent chance
the patientwill get another ulcer.

556
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,716
You mean you know that? And you're on his side?

557
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,837
l'm not on his side.

558
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,834
l'm in the operating room
almost every day of my life.

559
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,310
Sometimes l see things
that make me want to scream.

560
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,880
But l don't. That's you ... that's not me!

561
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,960
l say when a doctor does something wrong,
he's got to be stopped!

562
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,520
Oh, Luke! You expect too much!

563
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,960
A doctor's an ordinary man, like everybody else.

564
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,158
l've told you a hundred times. A doctor can't
be like anybody else. He deals with human life.

565
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,237
Human Life! You're not too
stupid to understand that, are you?

566
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:28,309
l know l'm not very smart, and sometimes l make
you angry because l don't think the way you do.

567
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,911
l was going to give you this next week -
for our anniversary.

568
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,870
Maybe you better look at it now.

569
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,996
l promised Bruni l'd come over. l'll be back early.

570
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,878
Now, then, gentlemen, our subject for today
will be surgery of the gall bladder.

571
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,557
lnfection of the biliary system is believed
to play a large part in the formation of ....

572
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,630
Yes, Marsh?

573
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,080
Sir - l want to apologize - for yesterday.

574
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,835
That's all right, Marsh. We all make mistakes!

575
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,640
Well, gentlemen, this is where the books
come to life.

576
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,870
Anything l could say now you
should have learned a year ago.

577
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,675
Don't let the patients frighten you. Make friends
with the nurses. They run the hospital.

578
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,790
No fooling! Thompson, you and
Morgan take Ward B. Ward C is all yours.

579
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,953
Oh .. eh.. good luck.

580
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,314
Thank you, Doctor... thank you.

581
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,475
Well .. er ... see ya ...Well? Cheer up. Yeah.

582
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,959
Hey - how do l look?
Ah - you're a magnificent animal.

583
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,550
No-no .. l mean - do l look like a doctor?
You're acting like one of the patients.

584
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:32,119
We'll knock 'em dead in there.
Not a very happy phrase - Doctor.

585
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,600
Good morning, Doctor. l'm Miss Katz.
This is Miss Collier. Good morning. Good morning

586
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,600
Hiya, Doll.

587
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,513
All right, healer, read this, follow me,and let's
see how many you can kill on the first day.

588
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,517
Mr. Roberts is first for, you, Doctor. Chronic colitis.

589
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,598
Mr. Roberts - how do you feel, this morning?

590
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,510
Lousy.

591
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,234
Well, you'll feel bettertomorrow . You wanna bet?

592
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,793
Well, you're through with intravenous feeding,
Mr. Clyde. You're gonna have some solid food.

593
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,273
lf you don't mind, Doc, l'll get along with this.

594
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,708
That was wonderful, Mrs.
Dayton. You'll be leaving soon.

595
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,393
l'd like to stay here, Doctor. l have no place to go.

596
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:56,240
You're not gonna do it, do you hear me?
You're not gonna operate on me.

597
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,160
But you've already agreed.
Your bladder is obstructed.

598
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,680
l don't care. You're not gonna cut me.

599
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,160
Now listen, Mr. Burke. You'll be
given an ordinary sleeping pill.

600
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,560
Upstairs a doctorwho has done it hundreds
of times will give you a spinal anaesthetic;

601
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,996
We'll make a small incision two inches
below the navel and relieve the obstruction.

602
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,474
lt'll take less than ten minutes.

603
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,760
You'll be weak, it'll hurt a little bit but
you'll be back up on your feet by four o'clock.

604
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,558
You make it sound easy. lt is easy. Now relax!

605
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,760
You're not kidding anybody, Slocum.

606
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,040
We know you're selling your blood.
How much you get for it?

607
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,316
Just five dollars a pint. This is your
last transfusion. Aw, Doc..l mean it!

608
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,788
This is no filling station.

609
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,751
Come on, Heidi - come on
- you know you can make it.

610
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,390
Come on !

611
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,593
That's the girl.

612
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,872
See, Heidi? l told you you could do it.

613
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:54,031
Four minutes and thirty seconds. The embroidery
was beautiful - but the patient died.

614
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,835
Luke - you don't know what l've been through!

615
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,032
She had the baby right here -
so help me! Right here!

616
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,670
And can you do something about this mole,
Doctor? lt drives me crazy.

617
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,833
lt certainly doesn't look very good.
Can't you remove it?.

618
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,640
lt's best to leave this kind alone.

619
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,680
Well then, can't you do something about my leg?
Every time l move it it hurts my hip..

620
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,600
and l still have the headache and the gas pains.

621
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,360
And you know what happened yesterday?
l got so dizzy, l almost fell over.

622
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,793
We'll do the bestwe can, Mrs. Ferris.

623
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,235
Hey,Doc - you think she's got trouble?
Listen to this: l ...

624
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,232
They didn't tell us about this part of it, you know!

625
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,351
Babcock, Deaver, Goulet,
Retractor, Bailey Rib Approximator.

626
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:11,918
Volkman rake, Richardson, Kelly .
Curved Kelly. They'll just ask for Kelly.

627
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,391
That's sloppy. Ask for exactly what you want,
and you'll get it.

628
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,080
l just don't know what to do with him, Doctor.
lf he isn't running around like a wild lndian

629
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,480
getting ail dirty he's getting into trouble in
the kitchen or pestering his father on his day off

630
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,920
or bothering me to go to a movie, and on
top of that he keeps blinking blinking blinking,

631
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,920
it drives me crazy and there must be
something you can do about it, Doctor.

632
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,356
l have a feeling, Mrs. Field,
he'd stop blinking if you'd stop talking.

633
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,108
You can relax, Doc: this one is real dead!

634
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:51,953
Oh, Doctor? Here's his stuff. Slid under a bus.

635
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,199
Al! Do you want some coffee? No, thank you.

636
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,713
What's the matter with you?

637
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,632
There's something l have to tell you.
Well, what is it?.

638
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,074
Accident case just came in!
He died in the ambulance.

639
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,510
So ?

640
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,153
ltwas your father, Luke.

641
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,108
Maybe l - l'd better. Let him go, Al.

642
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,678
You know how Luke is..

643
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,514
He'll...he'll have to be by himself.

644
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:52,509
Oh, Dr. Marsh. l'm going home
- and l wanted to say goodbye.

645
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,720
Well you look fine, Mrs. Ferris. How do you feel?

646
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,952
l know this is going to be a surprise to you,
but l feel good. Nothing hurts. Fine.

647
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,070
What's that?. Why, that's where
they took the mole off, Doctor.

648
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:05,752
They? Who's they? The other Doctor - your friend.

649
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:31,512
Luke - we were so worried. We called everywhere.
You all right? Yes, l'm all right.

650
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,880
Did you remove that mole? Well, did you?

651
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:35,790
Yeah. Why?

652
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,356
ltwasn't Just a mole.
lt was a melanoma. What?. You heard me!

653
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,270
Were you asleep or hung-over
when we had melanomas in class?

654
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,920
Luke, you've been up all night, and...
Why didn't you send her to surgery?

655
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,200
You know when you cut it off like that

656
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,280
you may have released cancer
cells right into her bloodstream?

657
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,360
l don't think it was a melanoma.

658
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:54,120
You don't think. How would you know? You spend
all your time making passes at the nurses

659
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,120
That's a pretty lousy thing to say, and you know it!

660
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,920
Now listen, Al! Luke, listen -
this isn't the place for this.

661
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,036
You may have killed that woman! Luke!

662
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:05,155
Either you report this or l will -
and l hope they throw the book at you.

663
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,799
l'll report it myself.

664
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,359
l have to finish rounds.

665
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,074
l said l have to finish rounds.

666
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,713
How could you talk to Alfred
like that in front of everybody?

667
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,473
You don't understand, you'll never understand.

668
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,791
l understand this much:

669
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,198
there are two people in
this world who care about you.

670
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,914
That's one of them.

671
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,559
l remembered you were on tonight.

672
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,156
Yeah, l'm on. Al, look:

673
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,510
l didn't mean what l said today.
You were right, though.

674
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,520
And Aarons told me even worse later.

675
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,400
But l didn't have to blow my
top in front of the nurses.

676
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,312
Ahhh - what's the difference. We've only
got a couple of more weeks here anyway.

677
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,240
Though l keep thinking about that
woman walking around, not even knowing.

678
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,878
Forget it. Maybe l was wrong.

679
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,550
l don't think l'll ever feel
right again if anything happens.

680
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,120
l know... but l didn't have to
add to it by shooting my mouth off.

681
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,240
Y'know with anybody else
this would be it for keeps.

682
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,913
But l know you -- push a button and off you go.

683
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,200
l don't know what it is. Sometimes l just take off.

684
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,033
Sometimes l wish l had seventy-five
more pounds. l'd belt you one!

685
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,398
Hey! l know how tough it was
for you to come down here tonight.

686
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,269
Okay.

687
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,949
Okay. Charge!

688
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:21,876
Well, gentlemen, you've completed your
internships. You're practising physicians now.

689
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,719
This will be your last staff meeting.

690
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,189
You saw your first dissection on this very table -

691
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,277
and l think it's fitting that we say goodbye here.

692
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,520
Now a pathologist usually has the last word,

693
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,353
but in this particular case it's a
very hard word to find, because -

694
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,034
well, because if you don't know it by now...
if it isn't in your hearts -

695
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,119
it's too late for me to tell it to you.

696
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,675
Goodbye. God bless all of you.

697
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,750
And -- don't endorse any cigarettes!

698
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,869
Sit down ... sit down ...

699
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,399
l just came to say goodbye.

700
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,678
l hear you're going to Hicksville. Greenville!

701
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,270
Sounds pretty small.

702
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:32,110
lt's farm country -- where they
never saw a thousand-dollar bill.

703
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,911
You think that makes the air purer there?

704
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,350
That's the way l feel.

705
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,350
Yes, indeed.

706
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,956
l can see the picture you've got of yourself already.

707
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:50,316
A country road, and an old Ford,
only it's not an old Ford - it's a white horse.

708
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,028
And you are St. George,
complete in spotless armor.

709
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,360
You get to a farmhouse.
There's a man bleeding to death...

710
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:01,152
alone - without instruments, without assistance,
you perform an impossible operation.

711
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,840
And because your heart is pure, you save him.

712
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,840
l haven't any such ...

713
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,795
You're gonna go down that road

714
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,715
and when you get there,
do you know what you're going to find?

715
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,797
A man with a boil on his backside.
Do you hear me?

716
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,151
A boil on his backside.

717
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,837
You will lance it - and go home.

718
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:25,790
Goodbye, Doctor .

719
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,590
Marsh!

720
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,754
You're one of the most brilliant
students we've ever graduated here.

721
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,398
You'll be a great physician.

722
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,269
But stop living your life like a greek tragedy

723
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,588
or you'll muff it!

724
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,795
Thank you.

725
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,395
Goodbye Doctor.

726
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:20,790
Welcome to Greenville.

727
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,553
Dr. Runkleman - this is my wife.

728
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,200
l'm happy to meet you Doctor.
l've heard so much about you.

729
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,077
Lies, all lies.

730
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,718
ls that all? That's it.

731
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,839
Naked ye come into the world,
and naked ye shall leave it.

732
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,519
You're a country doctor now.

733
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,353
My car's right over here.

734
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,914
Well - there it is. Greenville.

735
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,200
Picturesque cafes - gaily costumed natives -

736
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,190
- ten below in the winter -
a hundred and ten in the summer.

737
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,270
Hi, Martha!

738
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:15,599
She doesn't talk to me. Thirty years
ago l said she'd be dead in two months.

739
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,271
Diagnosis is my specialty!

740
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,437
Sam! Oh - hello, Doc.

741
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,399
Get off that leg! You won't
have it next month if you don't!

742
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,110
Now you better watch your blood pressure, Dave.
You'll live longer!

743
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,270
ldiot!

744
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,072
These are crazy people.

745
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:46,835
Last week a man caught his arm in a cultivator,

746
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,880
walked a mile holding it together.

747
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,000
And what do you suppose is
the first thing he asked me?

748
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,592
How much is it going to cost?.

749
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,593
You're a point-killer.

750
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:58,994
You want to remember that about farmers.
They always want to know what it's going to cost.

751
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,916
She's pretty sharp. Oh, yes.

752
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,989
Well - this is where you're going to live.
Oh - it looks very nice.

753
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,310
lt's not bad.

754
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:27,113
Here's the car l got for you.

755
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,516
lf you drive anything newer, they'll take
one look and yell: ''There goes my appendix''!

756
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:46,280
Well, l hope you like it. l'm sure we will .

757
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,759
l had a handy man clean it up.

758
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,472
My contribution to gracious living.

759
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:57,029
How much did you pay him? Seventy-five cents
an hour. You were robbed, Doctor.

760
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:02,718
Well, l better get over to the office.
See you in the morning, Luke. Eh.. eight o'clock.

761
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,390
Ye-uh.

762
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:14,518
All right .. go ahead. l can manage.
Come on - before she changes her mind.

763
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:24,514
This is Dr. Marsh - Miss Snow.

764
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,480
Miss Snow doesn't care how much you
reduce the population of Greenville,

765
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,840
as long as you don't bollox up
her appointments? Right? Wrong!

766
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:34,120
Old Lady Schoenman called. Bed rest.
Cafergot pill every hour for five hours. Migraine.

767
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,634
Mr. Jergens called again.
Double up on the Amphojel ...

768
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,199
The gentleman has an ulcer.

769
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:44,476
What's in the mail? Drug samples and bills
and another love letter from Mrs. Henderson.

770
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:45,670
Very funny !

771
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,710
Surprised, eh?

772
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,995
lt's a pretty big library.

773
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,953
You mean for a country Doctor?
Well, these days you have to keep up.

774
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:56,514
Your patients buy Reader's Digest

775
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,188
and the first thing you know they
have diseases you never heard of.

776
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,310
Well, go on, go on.

777
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,152
Adam Jerner has more pain in his arm.

778
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,550
Remove the weight every hour for five minutes.
What else?

779
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:07,837
Nothing more for now.
All right. Roll 'em in, roll 'em in!

780
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,479
Mr. Parrish. please.

781
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,789
Use the salve morning and evening -
and don't sit down too much.

782
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,434
l'm a bus driver. l'll drive the bus standing up!

783
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:30,916
l had a professor who told me l'd wind
up treating boils on the backside ...

784
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,439
Well - here it is - first case.

785
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,309
Did he also tell you you
probably wouldn't get paid for it?

786
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:45,910
Say Ah!

787
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:47,590
Again.

788
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,110
Again.

789
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,830
Again.

790
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,070
Again

791
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,919
Again. OUCH! That hurt!

792
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,391
Ahhh - don't be such a cry-baby!

793
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,800
l don't care what happened to your frog!
But l tell you, Emma.. lt's impossible!

794
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,234
All right, Emma - it's impossible!
But you're pregnant!

795
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,188
You're kidding! Oh no we're not!,

796
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:26,149
As a great man once said: ''lt's no
worse than a broken leg!'' Yeah, but....

797
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:35,031
One after every meal, Gertrude.
Thanks, Doctor. l - l hope they'll help. They will.

798
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,514
There's nothing wrong with her.

799
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,314
Look - when they come in and
they've got a pain, treat it.

800
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:45,195
When they come in and they only think they've
got a pain, treat the pain they think they've got.

801
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,596
You 'can't practice medicine;
you have to treat people.

802
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:58,150
About another inch.

803
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,710
Easy now....

804
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:10,990
Now!

805
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,633
NOW! CLOSE!

806
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,040
This kid just swallowed over eight
hundred dollars worth of diamonds!

807
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:44,152
lt won't hurt him any.
lt won't hurt him! What about me?

808
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,517
Just follow him around, Harry,
don't let him out of your sight!

809
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:53,156
Dave - have l got what l think l have?
Now don't kid me! Yes, Ed.

810
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,071
Will it hurt? We can take care of that.

811
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,470
Just like that, eh?

812
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:02,118
You're sixty-seven years old, Ed.
You've lived it up like an international playboy.

813
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:07,560
Takes one to know one, Dave. No regrets!

814
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:14,154
Are you guys sure this operation'll fix me?
Absolutely. We'll make a new man of you.

815
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,834
Well, when you do - send him the bill, willya?

816
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:22,349
l told you we'd get paid Luke.
No money, but lots of chicken on the table!

817
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:44,308
Tired? Oh, l'm dead. Dinner will
be ready in a few minutes. Good.

818
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:47,480
You must have had another big day. Big?

819
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:52,673
Kris, you have no idea.
Those people just swarm into that office.

820
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,360
l don't know where they all come from
in a small town like this.

821
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,432
That Runkleman's a one-man clinic.
He handles everything:

822
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:03,429
adenoids, cardiacs,
pregnancies, ingrown toe-nails.

823
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,352
And he's good, too, Kris. He's a good physician.

824
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,312
But l'll bet we handled over
two hundred cases this week.

825
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:13,073
That's what you wanted, Luke.

826
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,869
Yeah - but this much - this fast..

827
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,029
The way we work there just isn't time!

828
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:23,075
l'm always afraid, that some patient
isn't going to get enough attention.

829
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:28,719
Oh - people don't expect the world.
You can'twork all day and worry all night.

830
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,872
No, l suppose not..

831
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:37,033
You don't realize it yourself- but
you're so wrapped up in it, you haven't...

832
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:48,638
we haven't had time to talk.
And there's some things l want to tell you.

833
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:54,439
l'm happierthan l've ever been in my whole life.

834
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,114
l thought maybe l'd miss working, but l don't.

835
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:03,915
l go around all day telling myself how -
how smart l am to be a woman

836
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:06,039
and your wife.

837
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:12,639
Only l love you so much.

838
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,750
l want it to be complete!

839
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,350
Don't you think that now we could...

840
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:25,150
l want to have a family, Luke.

841
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:33,672
What l mean to say is - well ..

842
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:59,473
Yes? Yes - Dr. Marsh is here. Yes, Mrs. Bassett.

843
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:06,195
No - don't move him. Yes, right away.
Just give me the directions.

844
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:12,874
The Lang Farm on the old North Road...
left. Thank you.

845
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,433
Nat Bassett, a stableman; horse kicked him.

846
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,154
Thanks, Kris. You go back to sleep.

847
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,432
He'll rest now, Mrs. Bassett.

848
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,319
He shouldn't wake up any
more tonight. But if he does,

849
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,990
be absolutely sure that he doesn't
get out of bed. Thank you, Doctor.

850
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,830
Oh, incidentally, Doctor, l almost forgot.

851
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:37,112
Mrs. Lang asked if you'd stop up
to see herwhen you get through.

852
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:41,357
At one o'clock? She's up.

853
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,352
Good evening - l'm Dr. Marsh.

854
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:16,352
l'm Harriet Lang. Come in,
Doctor Marsh. Thank you.

855
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:21,116
l was worried about Nat Bassett. How is he?

856
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:25,592
Well - l can't tell yet. lf his hip is
broken he'll be in bed for a month or two.

857
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,996
l warned him about that horse. Oh?

858
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:32,155
He's at stud here. l breed Jumpers. l see.

859
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:37,751
This is Ben Cosgrove...Dr. Marsh. Doctor!

860
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,040
Well, l've been leaving for several hours...

861
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:49,438
Ben's a baby-sitter...for adults. Yeah!

862
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:52,150
Good night, Doctor.

863
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:55,790
Excuse me.

864
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,872
Whatwill you have to drink?

865
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,192
Nothing, thank you.

866
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:01,989
l like that song. Sometimes l just let it play.

867
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,317
Dave Runkleman told me about you.

868
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,154
He did?

869
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,113
Aren't you going to ask me what he said?

870
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,715
All right - what did he say?

871
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,268
He said you were born to be a doctor!

872
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:26,673
l wanted to meet you...really!

873
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,598
l'm embarrassing you.

874
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:33,680
No - you're' not embarrassing me, Mrs. Lang.
l'm just tired.

875
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,671
l'm operating tomorrow morning at seven.

876
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,760
They always warn you about solitary drinking,

877
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:43,231
but they never tell you how to get
people to stay up and drink with you.

878
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,875
l'm sorry you're lonely, Mrs. Lang.

879
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:55,750
l didn't say l was lonely.
l haven't been sleeping, and...

880
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,516
Well - l think you'll sleep tonight.

881
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:02,200
That's a very polite way of
saying l've had too much to drink.

882
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,952
And you're right - l have.

883
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,478
Goodnight, Dr. Marsh.

884
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,791
Goodnight, Mrs. Lang.

885
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,910
Greenville Hospital - good-morning.
Just a moment, please.

886
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:29,712
Greenville Hospital - good-morning.

887
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,760
Good morning, Mrs. Penrose,
and where are the medicine men?

888
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:40,118
Scrubbing. Toilet water,
Hormone cream - Lipstick - l love you.

889
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:49,153
l hear -- l hear you saw the Widow Lang last night.

890
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,917
Yeah - she was worried about
the stableman. What'd you think?

891
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,994
Well - the X-rays show that...
l don' t mean about the stableman ..Oh?

892
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:01,229
And don't tell me you didn't think.
Well, she seemed very nice .

893
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:02,670
Uh-huh...

894
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:15,910
Hiya, Doc. Lou! l haven't tried
last month's wonder drug yet.

895
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,872
Let's see - what do l need?

896
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:21,556
Four bottles of Zephirin -
twenty Procaine Penicillins -

897
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:25,998
about a thousand tongue blades - and a
couple of dozen ace bandages. Got that?

898
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:29,750
What l have is something real special.
Oh no! Just take a minute.

899
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:34,550
Say, Dave, who is Ben Cosgrove?

900
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:40,032
He's her lawyer -- and she hasn't done him
any good -- and watch out -- it's catching!

901
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:43,360
This is the first major improvement
in a stethoscope in thirty years.

902
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,555
You've never heard amplification like this.

903
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:56,710
Go ahead.

904
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:19,720
Should we buy it?. Yeah - it's pretty good, Dave.
How much? Two hundred and thirty.

905
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:24,555
Allright - drop it at the office. Now beat it.
Thanks, Dave. Dr. Marsh, see you next week.

906
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:36,148
We11? Well, what?

907
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,000
Come on .. come on! What'd you hear?
l didn't hear anything.

908
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,036
Don't lie ..Let's have it. All right

909
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:45,313
Systolic murmur, thrill, dullness in
the second interspace, unequal pulses.

910
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,560
Don't look so shocked. l've told it
to over a hundred people in my time.

911
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:52,520
How long have you known, Dave?
Couple of months - that's why you're here.

912
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:53,840
Well, you're gonna have to quit.

913
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,960
Look - l've already got old man's
kidneys and trouble in the prostate.

914
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:01,040
lt's not going to be so much fun from now on,
anyway...And if l don't keep busy..

915
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,320
But at least you could go East
- see Raermer - or Hamilton.

916
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:05,520
And have 'em try to sell me on surgery?
No thanks.

917
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:07,520
You've got to do something for yourself, Dave.

918
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:11,752
Look - when it ruptures, l'll go fast.
What more can you ask?

919
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:28,916
This is Dr. Snider - Dr. Marsh.
Dr. Snider is the Director of the Hospital.

920
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,990
Glad to know you. How do you do, Doctor?

921
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:36,440
ls Dr. Snider the anaesthetist?
You're a city boy - this is Greenville.

922
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:39,159
When a patient can 't afford a
regular man, Dr. Snider's it.

923
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,589
Ready, Clem? Ready.

924
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:23,440
Respiration's labored! What's her blood pressure?
Sixty over zero. She's cyanotic.

925
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,160
Clamp that Pentathol off! Give her straight saline.

926
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:30,790
Endotracheal tube - quick! You let her
go into spasm - she can't get any air!

927
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,800
She's closing. l can't get it down!
You'll have to cut her in the throat.

928
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,560
Knife! No - wait a minute, Dave ...
Curare. l don't think it'll work.

929
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,074
lf it doest relax her, we can still cut. Go ahead.

930
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,757
She seems to be responding.
Get that tube again!

931
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:20,552
Oxygen. Oxygen!

932
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,675
Fresh gown and gloves!

933
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,749
Her color's coming back. l guess, she'll be all right.

934
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,755
Thank you, Kris. You were wonderful.

935
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:52,280
Look at him - the weight of the world!
l know what it is.

936
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:55,200
He's been itching all day to
harangue me about Dr. Snider.

937
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,240
Well l have been trying to talk to you all day, Dave.

938
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:59,760
That business about the Pentathol was..
Please, Luke. Not tonight.

939
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,832
l've got to talk to him. All right...
you want me to say it?. l'll say it.

940
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:06,240
He's unsure of himself.
He wasn't the best to begin with,

941
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:09,440
but he's the head of the hospital!
And he's incompetent. All right!

942
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:13,000
l watch him. l try to keep him out of trouble,
but we're stuck with him.

943
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,710
He's a political appointment, Luke - and there's
nothing you, l, or anybody else can do about it.

944
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:20,800
Now can we forget it, and try to enjoy ourselves?

945
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,394
This is my night off, for the love of Mike.

946
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,552
Harriet! Hey!

947
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,630
Hiya, Dave. Dave Runkleman .

948
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,673
How are you, Dave?

949
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,319
Hello, Dr. Marsh.

950
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:43,634
Good evening Mrs. Lang.
My wife. Mrs. Lang - Mr. Cosgrove.

951
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,310
How do you do?

952
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,152
Pleased to meetcha.

953
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:08,511
Have another .. Oh-l've already
had too many. Have one more ...

954
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:20,160
Stop worrying. She's been dancing with Ben for
years now, and nothing's ever happened.

955
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,639
l'm not worrying!

956
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:25,640
But l wish she didn' t look
so beautiful in that dress.

957
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:28,757
lf l spent that much time and money,
l'd look beautiful myself.

958
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,751
You make a fine looking couple.

959
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:53,400
Hey, Kris. You ve had quite a few already.
l prescribed it. You stay out of this.

960
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:58,155
Watch out for him. He's a wicked old man.
l sure am ... here's a fresh drink.

961
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:02,035
Er - she doesn't drink. Her Doctor disapproves.

962
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:05,831
Er.. what's the Latin for
Gin and Vermouth, Doctor?

963
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,993
What? Here we go again.
Ben doesn't approve of Doctors.

964
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:13,840
He thinks we write our prescriptions
in Latin just to mystify the patients.

965
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:16,560
Oh- instead of the Simple way
the lawyers write contracts?

966
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,074
Listen - we're amateurs next to you.

967
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:23,360
You're a secret society. You've got
everything except the grip and the high sign.

968
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,033
Ben - you're drunk - and you
don't know what you're talking about.

969
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:30,797
l don't know? l'm just drunk
enough to tell you guys something!

970
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,156
When they getwise to how little you know,

971
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,800
you won't be able to kill
people and get away with it!

972
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:38,760
l've lost a few patients - l've saved many more.

973
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:43,520
Look, Cosgrove, we all know that occasionally..
Just what do you know, Doctor?

974
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:46,240
Ben - you're being very rude! And very stupid.

975
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:49,080
Am l? You don't know why the heart beats,

976
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:51,958
you don't know what thought is -
why the nerves feel.

977
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:56,040
You don't even know why a woman gives
birth in nine months instead of twelve.

978
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:59,874
You don't even know.. We don't know
all of it -- No. But we're learning.

979
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:04,113
Learning? You're not learning -
you're subdividing.,

980
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:09,873
One guy stakes out a claim on the lungs,
another on the stomach, another on the heart.

981
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:13,835
And if the territory overlaps a bit -
you divide up the take.

982
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:16,993
You've even got a name for it! Fee splitting.

983
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:23,953
Yeah - that's it. And the poor slob of a
patient pays both of you, without even realizing it.

984
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,920
ln nursing school they used to have a joke.

985
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:30,071
Doctors wear rubber gloves so
they won't leave fingerprints.

986
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,880
All right, Kris - that's not very funny.
That's right, shut her up.

987
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:39,000
The secret society at work. Why don't you
guys stop acting like a bunch of quacks?

988
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,276
Why don't you stop acting like a shyster lawyer?

989
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:47,672
Are you calling me a shyster?
Shut up - the both of you! This is a public place!

990
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:54,314
l'm sorry.... , l think we'd better go home.

991
01:31:57,640 --> 01:32:02,160
l don't care what you say... you're supposed to be
a Doctor's wife. lf you can't drink, don't drink..

992
01:32:02,160 --> 01:32:05,436
l never drink, Luke, you know that ..
that's why l .. At least be honest.

993
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,880
You drank too much and you talked too much

994
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:10,348
because you were annoyed at
my dancing with Harriet Lang.

995
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,833
You said that, Luke. l didn't.

996
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:35,354
Kris?

997
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:37,514
What?

998
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,592
l'm sorry.

999
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:45,630
lt's all right. ltwas my fault, too.

1000
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:50,636
No. l was sore about Snider and then
Cosgrove - and l just took it all out on you.

1001
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,236
We don't talk enough, Luke.

1002
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:01,991
lt isn't that we fight.

1003
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,477
We just don't seem to have
much to say to each other.

1004
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:11,995
Sometimes l wish... Kris - look -
we just had a little argument, that's all.

1005
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,397
l said l was sorry.

1006
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:18,756
lt is not good fortwo people to be like this.

1007
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,234
No - l guess not.

1008
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:27,632
l tried to talk to you the
other night but you were so tired.

1009
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:34,350
We're established here now. We have this house.

1010
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:39,316
Some day soon we ought to
think about having a family.

1011
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:50,909
lt's too early to talk about that.
l just started to practice here, really, we -

1012
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:54,156
-we can't take on too much yet.

1013
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:58,599
But itwouldn't have to cost a lot,
and l could always ..Kris!

1014
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,916
Let's talk about it some other time.

1015
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,069
Good night, Luke.

1016
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:15,279
Good night, Kris.

1017
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:48,280
Well - if it isn't the good Doctor. What are you
doing out here? Patient down the road.

1018
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:52,114
Through for the day? Uh-huh.
Come on up to the house. l'll buy you a drink.

1019
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,793
l'll freshen it up for you...

1020
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:31,439
lt's no good. What do you mean - it's no good?
l mean it's no good...

1021
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:34,830
for me!

1022
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:39,000
l still don't understand what you...
You told me l was lonely. l am!

1023
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,320
My life is horses and dinner
twice a week with Ben Cosgrove.

1024
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:47,199
lt's not very exciting, but...but you just
don'twant to take a chance on anything more.

1025
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:52,351
Not with you! Look- you spend
twenty-four hours a day on medicine

1026
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:56,116
and you go thru the motions of a marriage...

1027
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:58,992
you haven't got time for me.

1028
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:00,988
Then why did you ask me up here?

1029
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:07,796
Because l wanted to -- and itwas stupid.
l can't afford to fall in love with you.

1030
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:14,912
Well, you're lucky you can turn
it on and off like that .. l can't!

1031
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:30,431
Sucker!

1032
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:57,590
Well, Al?

1033
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:01,080
Well - your blood pressure's normal;
your hemoglobin's excellent;

1034
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:02,320
you have no communicable diseases,

1035
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:05,392
and congratulations on
being twelve weeks pregnant.

1036
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:08,274
Thanks - that's aboutwhat l figured.

1037
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:12,276
Lucas Marsh being a
father staggers my imagination.

1038
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:15,637
Was he excited? What did he say?
l'll bet he's doing handstands. Al!

1039
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:17,838
What's the matter, Kris?

1040
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,831
l haven't told Luke.

1041
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:26,558
You haven't told him? That's ridiculous!

1042
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:30,829
This isn't the kind of a secret you keep, Kris.
Especially from a Doctor. Why?

1043
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:41,397
What is it, Kris? He doest want a baby. Oh!

1044
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:46,712
Most men don't...until they find out about it.

1045
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:50,153
Then they rush out and buy electric
trains when there's still eight months to go.

1046
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:51,275
Not Luke.

1047
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:54,759
You know, we don't have that kind of marriage.

1048
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,833
Thanks Al!

1049
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:10,518
Kris! Tell him. No matter what. Tell him!

1050
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,035
Anne, have l a light day this week?

1051
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:32,235
Thursday! Good. Switch all the appointments,
l won't be in at all.

1052
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:33,713
All right, Doctor.

1053
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:44,552
He may have a slight fever after that shot,
but he'll be all right.

1054
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:46,432
Goodnight, Mrs. Bassett. Goodnight, Doctor.

1055
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,351
Good evening, O'Dell. Good evening, Doctor.

1056
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:13,630
Who's this?

1057
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:16,836
Aterminal - pneumonia.

1058
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,640
Bettertake his temperature. He's burning up.

1059
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:27,995
Can't be, Doctor. His pulse
has been very slow..Take it!

1060
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,834
What's his name? Simmons, Carlisle Simmons.

1061
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:41,708
There's nothing on here!
There was nothing to chart.

1062
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,556
Has Dr. Snider seen him? Of course.

1063
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,793
Well, what instructions did he give?
None. He never does in these cases.

1064
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:50,914
These cases?

1065
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,230
When their time comes Doctor always
lets the old ones cross over peacefully.

1066
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:57,955
This one won't last until morning.

1067
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:02,070
What is it?

1068
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:05,595
A hundred and four. Here!

1069
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:34,358
Were these spots on him when
Doctor Snider examined him? Yes, Sir.

1070
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:41,674
Guide the bed! But Doctor... Guide the bed!

1071
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:51,040
Dr. Marsh! This is my patient. What are you doing?

1072
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,200
O'Dell - l want two ampules of
chloromycetin and some oxygen.

1073
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:55,720
Doctor - l have my ward patients!
Don't argue with me, O'Dell, l want them.

1074
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:57,640
And telephone my wife -
tell her to get here right away .-

1075
01:42:57,640 --> 01:42:59,120
This man has typhoid. We can't waste any time.

1076
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:03,000
Now look here Marsh.. l don't know what..
Stay out of the way ... l've got to isolate him!

1077
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,160
Go make that call, O'Dell .

1078
01:43:04,160 --> 01:43:07,520
Marsh, l'm head of this hospital,
and l'm ordering you to stop disrupting it!

1079
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:11,280
Dr. Snider, you've exposed this whole
hospital to typhoid. That's bad enough.

1080
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:14,080
But it's unbelievable that you
would deliberately let a patient die.

1081
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:17,360
That's an old man. He's going. There's
nothing anybody can do about it. You're a doctor.

1082
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:20,989
You've no right to make that decision.
You're supposed to keep him alive!

1083
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:27,194
He's in shock. Where are the blocks?
We haven't any.

1084
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:37,838
You're wasting your time. l can always tell.
He'll go before six o'clock tomorrow morning.

1085
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:43,595
Get out of here, Snider, before l kill you!

1086
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:47,190
You're insane ..

1087
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:01,075
Get that tank of oxygen.

1088
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:22,470
Alcohol, please.

1089
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:28,035
And l need more blood.....

1090
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:34,795
l'll do that ... here ... check his pressure.

1091
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:51,037
He should be responding. Still no pressure.
Cortisone, a hundred milligrams.

1092
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:06,754
Massage his legs ...

1093
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:34,918
Well - he's out of shock.
Help me with the bed, will you?

1094
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:42,951
We'll need more saline. l'll get it. Keep sponging.

1095
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,359
He stopped breathing!

1096
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:26,433
l think you've got him ... He's breathing now.
Better give him a shot of Coramine...

1097
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:37,919
l'll take over.

1098
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:46,396
That could have been the ball game.

1099
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:44,314
l'll bet you're tired. A little.

1100
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,911
Kris - there's something l want to tell you.

1101
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:53,278
You were wonderful. l've always known it,
but l've never said it to you before.

1102
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:55,790
You're great!

1103
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:58,634
You're a great nurse.

1104
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:06,396
All this talk we've had about
housework and families... that isn't for you.

1105
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:12,875
You've got to come back here to the hospital.
You're needed here, Kris.

1106
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:19,795
l am tired, Luke. l'm going home.

1107
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:56,035
Ladies and gentlemen
the voice of Dr. David Runkleman.

1108
01:49:57,160 --> 01:50:01,760
Ladies and gentlemen: There is typhoid
in Greenville. Typhoid is highly contagious.

1109
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:04,160
We can prevent an epidemic if you will all,

1110
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:06,469
each and everyone of you,
do exactly as you are told.

1111
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:09,640
Come to your county hospital
immediately for inoculation.

1112
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:14,191
l repeat: Come to your county
hospital immediately for inoculation.

1113
01:50:14,840 --> 01:50:18,515
That's beautiful, Harry.
On the hour every hour, right? Right, Doctor.

1114
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:34,074
Your next shot will be a week from today.

1115
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:42,600
Your next shot is a week from today.
Dr. Runkleman, l presume?

1116
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:44,875
Who are you? l'm Alfred Boone, Doctor.

1117
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:58,553
l .. er... l was told you'd have a Cadillac.

1118
01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:01,555
lt's only a front - the Cadillac has me.

1119
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:03,960
ls Luke around? He's out giving shots.

1120
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:07,430
Then l'll go over and see Kristina.
Roll up your sleeve, first.

1121
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:10,314
You're kidding! Roll up your sleeve!

1122
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:12,631
Oh - fine.

1123
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:24,200
Greenville Hospital - good evening.

1124
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:27,640
Oh - hello, Mrs. Marsh.
Yes, Dr. Marsh just called in.

1125
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:30,916
He has one more shot to give ..
at Mrs. Lang's place.

1126
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:35,039
Thank you.

1127
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:40,512
He has only one more call, he'll be home soon.

1128
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,271
More coffee? No, l'm fine.

1129
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:54,833
This is a kind of an awkward Silence, Kris.
What's happening?

1130
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:00,990
l haven't told Luke about the baby, Al.

1131
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:03,873
l think you'd better level with me.

1132
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:09,716
l tried to tell him, but l couldn't.
You have to! l just couldn't.

1133
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:14,355
Look, when Luke told me he was going to
marry you,l nearly flipped. You know that.

1134
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:18,160
But l was never more wrong, and l want to help.

1135
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:20,071
That's why l came down here.

1136
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:26,752
l know, Al - and l appreciate it.
But l've got to work it out myself.

1137
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:32,270
Yeah...

1138
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:37,520
Look, l don'twant you to think
l'm starving to death, but ..er...

1139
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:38,999
what have you got in the ice-box?

1140
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:42,199
l'll see!

1141
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:58,153
Goodnight, Mrs. Lang.
Thank you.. Goodnight, Clara.

1142
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:05,510
What are you thinking?

1143
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:09,950
Nothing. Be honest.

1144
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:13,314
All right...l don't know..l just felt.. Guilty?

1145
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:17,916
Maybe. l hate to say l told you so.

1146
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:19,955
Yeah -

1147
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:24,392
l do feel guilty and l don't like the feeling.

1148
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:28,872
You're supposed to be a man
who doesn't care about his wife.

1149
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,510
Yeah.

1150
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:36,231
lt doesn't matter. But you don't feel
this guilty if you don't care, Luke..

1151
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:41,113
What's the use of talking?

1152
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:46,671
You want to go, why don't you? Come on!

1153
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,518
Harriet, l really didn't figure it thatway...

1154
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:55,632
l don't have any problems l didn't have before.

1155
01:53:56,720 --> 01:54:03,592
l told you once... horses... tomorrow night
dinner with Ben Cosgrove.. l'll live .

1156
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:08,110
Goodnight, Harriet.

1157
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:36,390
Hey!

1158
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:48,477
Al.. What are you doin'...Get in!

1159
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:55,440
What are you doing around
here in the middle of the night.

1160
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:57,800
Waiting for you. Well come on inside.

1161
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:00,917
l've been inside ... for six and a half hours.

1162
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,279
Well - what goes?

1163
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:06,037
lt's a good question .... you tell me.

1164
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:10,952
Now Al, look ...Now save your breath if you're
gonna tell me to mind my own business.

1165
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:14,910
She's pregnant.

1166
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:26,713
She never said a word.
She tried to a couple of times.

1167
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:30,110
Yes, she did.

1168
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:35,831
Look- you're a doctor! Don't you ever look at her?

1169
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:37,630
Well? Don't you?

1170
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:40,912
l wish l had.

1171
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:47,196
The time is now ... try it.

1172
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:01,751
Al...Save it ... l'll see you, huh?

1173
01:56:26,120 --> 01:56:27,030
Kris ...

1174
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:32,991
Kris, Al waited for me outside.

1175
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:38,269
l had no idea .. if l'd only known...

1176
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:45,116
Kris - l'm sorry. l'm really sorry.

1177
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:50,392
Just let me try... l promise you...

1178
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:55,390
Get up!

1179
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:07,872
You're always sorry.
Every time you hurt me you're sorry.

1180
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:11,632
You always try to fix it by
acting as though you love me.

1181
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:14,233
lt doesn't work any more.

1182
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:16,872
l know where you were tonight.

1183
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:23,038
l can't forgive you. Kris - listen to me ..
you've got to listen to me!

1184
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:28,548
l've been wrong - l know it.
But l swear to you ... l swear to you..No!

1185
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:31,120
You listen to me and don't interrupt,

1186
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:32,997
because nothing - nothing you can say will matter!

1187
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:36,600
From the beginning you
never thought l was smart enough

1188
01:57:36,600 --> 01:57:39,680
or attractive enough,
or woman enough - to be yourwife.

1189
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:42,240
You come crawling in here
now because your friend told you

1190
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:44,080
l was going to have your child.

1191
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:48,800
Stop pretending! l'm sick of it!
l don't need you to have this child!

1192
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:50,995
Kris - you've got to listen to me! Don't!

1193
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:53,840
You had to have money, so you married me.

1194
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:57,389
Well, you made it ... you're a doctor!
You don't need me now!

1195
01:57:57,560 --> 01:58:00,028
And l don't need the little you got to give me.

1196
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:04,433
l don'twant to live with you, Luke.
Please - get out of here!

1197
01:58:05,200 --> 01:58:06,110
Go away!

1198
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:10,358
Get out of here, Luke!

1199
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:12,910
Please!

1200
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:11,630
What a day!

1201
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:15,035
Any messages? Yes, Doctor.

1202
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:17,590
Dr. Marsh - here are yours. Thank you.

1203
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:25,674
Anything from Kris? No.
l saw her last night.

1204
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:29,669
She's all right. l thought
you might have heard from her.

1205
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:32,391
l think l must be losing my touch.

1206
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,951
Well - thanks for trying anyway.

1207
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:47,355
Good evening, Dr. Marsh. How are you, Felton?

1208
01:59:53,120 --> 01:59:55,031
Well, you're looking better, Mr. Parker.

1209
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:00,188
Continue sedation!

1210
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:07,150
How are you,Charlie? Fine, Doc.

1211
02:00:09,240 --> 02:00:10,150
Let's have a listen.

1212
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:17,510
Marsh...

1213
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:22,589
1t's - it's Dave Runkleman!

1214
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:33,320
He just grabbed his chest and fell over.

1215
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:36,915
Hit me - like a truck ..
Demarol - a hundred milligrams - quick!

1216
02:00:48,280 --> 02:00:51,078
He'll have to go in.
The aorta's tearing. He's hemorrhaging.

1217
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:54,200
Don't you think we ought to try to get
hold of Stafford or some other heart man?

1218
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:56,077
There's isn't time. You'll have to assist.

1219
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:59,031
All right. l'll get someone
to handle the anaesthesia.

1220
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:06,516
Don't take it so big Luke. lt happens to everybody.

1221
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:08,670
Shut up, Dave.

1222
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:05,359
Slow and regularly, holding nicely.
Right angle clamp please.

1223
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:07,188
There it is ..There's the break.

1224
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:13,231
Ductus clamp ... Retract.
l'll need more exposure ..

1225
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:19,509
Steady this, please.
Suture. Four-O, Arterial... Large forceps.

1226
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:21,359
Sponge...Tag the end...

1227
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:24,550
Clear the field.

1228
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:27,080
Suture scissors...How's the pressure, Doctor?

1229
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:29,799
lt is okay... a hundred and ten over seventy ..

1230
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:32,790
Check the suction.

1231
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:39,310
Gill foam, please.

1232
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:43,160
All right- that's it.

1233
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:44,160
Better get out.

1234
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:47,197
No, not yet. We'll need more oxygen...
Turn it up, please.

1235
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:04,160
All right .. You've got it. You've stopped the leak.
Let's close. Thumb forceps!

1236
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:06,600
.. l'm going to wrap the aorta.
l want to give him every chance l can.

1237
02:03:06,600 --> 02:03:08,158
You'll have to get under it. l intend to.

1238
02:03:08,680 --> 02:03:11,433
lt's very thin. l wouldn't try, Marsh.
Dissecting scissors ..

1239
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:13,352
Take him deeper, Doctor...Plastic..

1240
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:21,550
Better go easy. l've got to get underneath.

1241
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:24,113
Careful, it's stretching.

1242
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:26,519
You'll have to stop the lung action.

1243
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,115
There, l've almost got it ...

1244
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:34,400
Watch it! Marsh - 1t's rupturing!

1245
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,310
Clamps - quickly!

1246
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:45,473
Cut the ether! Oxygen only.

1247
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:50,471
McCray - all the blood you can get, fast!

1248
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:53,800
O'Dell - more blood!

1249
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:55,279
Keep that suction going, Barker. Knife!

1250
02:03:56,560 --> 02:04:00,553
Leg transfusion! We'll have to
extend the incision...Bone cutters..

1251
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:11,397
Retractor...Barker...Hemostat. No, the curved one.

1252
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:20,189
Forceps - Rheinhoff- These won't hold...Cushing!
Hemostat...vein tubing ..

1253
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:31,280
How many units have you got?
Six, Doctor. l'll need more than that- lots more.

1254
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:35,114
Get them - all you can get.
Wait, put that scope where l can see it first.

1255
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:40,436
Left aneurysm needle, Barker.

1256
02:04:48,080 --> 02:04:50,992
He's slipping! The pulse is weak!

1257
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:02,272
Pressure bulbs! Come on, Barker.
Hard on that retractor.

1258
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:06,838
Get this instrument out of my way.
Get rid of it. Take over here, Snider. .

1259
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:11,790
More clamps! We've got to get that blood in faster.

1260
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:14,475
His pulse is failing. l can hardly get it.

1261
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:27,719
Heart is stopped, Doctor. Adrenalin - fast!
You give lt, l'll massage.

1262
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:53,868
No response.

1263
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:11,910
Still nothing...

1264
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:40,710
Doctor ....

1265
02:06:46,640 --> 02:06:47,550
Doctor!

1266
02:07:01,160 --> 02:07:02,388
He's gone Marsh.

1267
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:34,278
God help him, he made a mistake.

1268
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:52,035
Kris!

1269
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:54,629
Luke.

1270
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:04,196
Kris - help me! For God's sake - help me!
