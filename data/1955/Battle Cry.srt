1
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,874
<i>They call me Mac.</i>
<i>The name's not important.</i>

2
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,841
<i>It's January 1942.</i>

3
00:01:28,012 --> 00:01:30,845
<i>Marine outposts around the world</i>
<i>have fallen to the Japanese.</i>

4
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:34,041
<i>Our ranks are empty and ill-equipped.</i>
<i>We need help.</i>

5
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:37,619
<i>From every part of the country,</i>
<i>kids are answering our call.</i>

6
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:39,916
<i>This is Baltimore, Maryland.</i>

7
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:41,991
Detail, halt!

8
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,219
Left face!

9
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:49,660
You men have got a few minutes
to see your folks. Fall out!

10
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:53,364
Ma and Pa's over here.

11
00:01:53,538 --> 00:01:56,871
Hey, lady, my brother's a Marine.

12
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:01,341
If your father had listened to me,
you wouldn't be going to war at 19.

13
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:04,640
- Mom, let's not go over that again.
- I'm proud of you, son.

14
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:06,439
Danny!

15
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:09,142
Hi, Danny. I'm sorry I'm late.

16
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,447
- Scared?
- A little.

17
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:14,651
Look, suppose I'm gone
a year or two years.

18
00:02:14,826 --> 00:02:16,919
Suppose you want to change
your mind.

19
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,188
Well, we'd both be awfully hurt then.

20
00:02:19,364 --> 00:02:21,161
I won't change my mind.

21
00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:23,892
I just want to go on being your girl.

22
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:26,059
Kathy...

23
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:37,611
I guess this kind
of makes us engaged, huh?

24
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,874
Yes.

25
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,348
All right, Section 5, all aboard!

26
00:02:41,886 --> 00:02:44,013
Section 5!

27
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:47,490
Let's go, on the double, come on!

28
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:51,458
- Good luck, son.
- All right, all aboard, let's go.

29
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,065
If they don't treat you right,
you come right back.

30
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,582
How long can we go on like this,
sneaking around, meeting in cheap joints?

31
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:15,844
- You'd get to hate me.
- I could never hate you.

32
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,719
But your old man hates me. I won't be
able to get a decent job in this lousy town.

33
00:03:20,892 --> 00:03:23,793
Sue, can't you see I'd rot here?
I couldn't take it!

34
00:03:23,961 --> 00:03:27,124
Ski, what's gonna happen
if you can't get me to California?

35
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:30,495
Baby, I'll save every nickel,
and I'll send for you.

36
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,898
We'll be away from Philly
and your old man.

37
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:35,266
- All aboard!
- Oh, honey!

38
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,670
All right, men. Get aboard.

39
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,275
Come on now, hurry up!

40
00:03:39,444 --> 00:03:42,140
- I've got to go, baby.
- Get aboard!

41
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:45,077
<i>Scenes like this are played</i>
<i>all over the land...</i>

42
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:49,345
<i>... as boys from the cities and from</i>
<i>the farms rush to fill our ranks.</i>

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,717
<i>All trains head west.</i>
<i>Destination, San Diego.</i>

44
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,859
<i>This bunch looks like</i>
<i>any other group we're getting.</i>

45
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,757
<i>Politics and wars</i>
<i>make strange bedfellows.</i>

46
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,627
<i>In almost every car,</i>
<i>you'll find a Texan with a guitar...</i>

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,132
<i>... an all-American boy...</i>

48
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,335
<i>... the farmer...</i>

49
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:10,664
<i>... the pride of the Navajos.</i>

50
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:13,809
<i>Then there's the slum kid...</i>

51
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:16,177
<i>... the bookworm...</i>

52
00:04:16,747 --> 00:04:19,079
<i>... the lumberjack.</i>

53
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:23,111
<i>And there's one in every outfit.</i>

54
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:47,144
<i>And you'll usually find</i>
<i>a troublemaker.</i>

55
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:51,876
- Put it back. You didn't make your point.
- What do you mean?

56
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:55,610
- You accusing me of something dishonest?
- Put it back.

57
00:04:57,321 --> 00:05:01,417
I was only kidding.
Let's be buddies.

58
00:05:07,198 --> 00:05:09,530
- Spanish Joe's a troublemaker.
- Yeah.

59
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,294
He'll learn. The hard way.

60
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:17,340
- I wish we were in San Diego already.
- We'll be there soon enough.

61
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:21,111
You're a couple of nice guys.
I hope we stick together.

62
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,008
Be okay.

63
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,480
- Got a gal, Marion?
- No.

64
00:05:28,653 --> 00:05:29,779
How about you, Andy?

65
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,388
Do I got a gal?
I got hundreds of them.

66
00:05:32,557 --> 00:05:35,287
Every broad in the north woods
knows old Andy.

67
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:37,825
Not me. I got one, that's all I need.

68
00:05:37,995 --> 00:05:39,519
One?

69
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:41,790
This guy's nuts.

70
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:45,602
<i>San Diego, the end of the line.</i>

71
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,536
<i>As they arrive at boot camp,</i>
<i>the door to their past shuts behind them.</i>

72
00:05:49,707 --> 00:05:52,608
Get off that truck. Get off.

73
00:05:55,846 --> 00:05:57,507
Quickly.

74
00:06:04,222 --> 00:06:07,680
Get back in there!

75
00:06:07,858 --> 00:06:09,621
Get going.

76
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:28,606
All right, you guys,
follow that white line over there.

77
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:35,146
- My head feels like a prickly pear!
- I've been scalped!

78
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,810
Gonna let my eyebrows grow out
and throw them back!

79
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:41,885
Move it in, you guys!

80
00:06:42,059 --> 00:06:43,720
Come on! Move out!

81
00:06:43,894 --> 00:06:45,623
Over there, you skinheads!

82
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:48,993
The rest of you get in there
and get deloused.

83
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:07,917
All right, you people.
My name is Sergeant Beller.

84
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:11,111
You guys are going to hate the day
you met me.

85
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:15,783
As far as I'm concerned,
you are not human beings anymore.

86
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:19,096
And don't get the idea you're Marines!

87
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:21,561
You're recruits! Meatheads!

88
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:25,395
The lowest form of animal
in this here universe.

89
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:28,595
You will refer to me as "sir."

90
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,029
All right.

91
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:35,110
You'll eat no candy,
read no papers, hear no radios...

92
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,407
...and speak only when spoken to.

93
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:44,316
You will salute everything moving
above the rank of private.

94
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:50,289
- What's your name, son?
- L.Q. Jones.

95
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:56,766
"My name is Private Jones, L.Q., sir!"

96
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:00,426
My name is Private L.Q. Jones, sir.

97
00:08:00,604 --> 00:08:01,628
Your Honor.

98
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:05,037
- Where are you from, meathead?
- Cotton Plant, sir.

99
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:07,404
- Cotton Plant, what?
- Arkansas.

100
00:08:07,578 --> 00:08:10,342
It ain't no more than a wide spot
in a thin road...

101
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:11,842
Shut up!

102
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:14,541
Who said you could talk?

103
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:18,046
- You chewing gum, son?
- Yes, sir.

104
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:20,247
Swallow it.

105
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:26,957
All right, you people, from now on,
it's gonna be double-time.

106
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,655
No more walking.

107
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,597
All right, you're gonna get fed now.

108
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:34,761
Personally, I think it's
a waste of government money.

109
00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:36,804
Right face!

110
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,306
Forward march!

111
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,779
<i>After the cordial welcome</i>
<i>to the Corps...</i>

112
00:08:42,947 --> 00:08:45,575
<i>... comes the job</i>
<i>of turning boys into men.</i>

113
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,547
About face!

114
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:50,550
Face left.

115
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,457
Ready, front!

116
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,687
Let's get that hat down!

117
00:08:57,862 --> 00:08:59,557
Cut down that belt!

118
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,358
Pull up your pants, son!

119
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:07,970
- You want that button?
- Yes, sir.

120
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:15,107
- Did you shave this morning?
- I shaved twice, sir.

121
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,578
You didn't slip up and put a blade
in the razor, did you?

122
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:21,013
A blade, sir? No, sir.

123
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:24,445
Us full-blooded Indians
never shave.

124
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,926
The Marine Corps says you gotta shave
every morning whether you need it or not!

125
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:35,193
The Indian love call.

126
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,596
We've got a wise guy in our midst.

127
00:09:37,768 --> 00:09:40,202
You guys must need some exercise.

128
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:44,603
All right. Right face!

129
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:47,107
Forward, hut!

130
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:49,610
Double-time, hut!

131
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,645
Lift them up! Hut!

132
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:54,450
Come on, step it up, you guys. Move!

133
00:09:54,618 --> 00:09:58,418
<i>So it goes from sunup to sundown.</i>
<i>Days turn into weeks.</i>

134
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:02,355
<i>They learn that the price</i>
<i>of the green uniform comes high.</i>

135
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:05,086
Move! Get the lead out,
you meatheads!

136
00:10:05,262 --> 00:10:06,854
Move!

137
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:12,796
<i>Then suddenly, you're beginning to learn the</i>
<i>lesson the instructor has been pounding in.</i>

138
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,768
<i>There's no place for stragglers</i>
<i>in the Marine Corps.</i>

139
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,375
Forward.

140
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:21,306
Left oblique! Huh!

141
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:23,976
File out, file out.

142
00:10:24,148 --> 00:10:26,241
Right oblique! Huh!

143
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,248
To the rear. Huh!

144
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:32,947
<i>And you're sure that yours</i>
<i>is the best outfit in boot camp.</i>

145
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:35,420
<i>Dear Kathy:</i>

146
00:10:37,962 --> 00:10:41,989
<i>Ten weeks have passed,</i>
<i>and tomorrow we finish boot camp.</i>

147
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:46,830
<i>We hope we can stick together</i>
<i>and go to radio school from here.</i>

148
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:55,040
Man, this living in tents
behind closed gates is tough on me.

149
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,079
I can't even remember
what a woman looks like.

150
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:01,685
It's tougher on me.
I can remember.

151
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,151
I'm gonna kill that Beller, I'm gonna
rip him apart with my bare hands.

152
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:11,658
- Tell us your side of the story.
- They got a picture tonight about Marines.

153
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:14,093
And I hate pictures about Marines.

154
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:17,098
I thought it was
a cowboys-and-lndians picture.

155
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:19,202
I know that picture, cousin.

156
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,203
This here Marine private
gets a set of dress blues...

157
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, <i>The Real Marine.</i>

158
00:11:24,174 --> 00:11:27,666
Isn't that the one where the broad
flips her lid for the private?

159
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:31,209
That's it. He's a Marine
because his daddy was a Marine.

160
00:11:31,382 --> 00:11:35,148
He hates the Corps,
but learns to love it just like we do.

161
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,879
Ends up saving the life
of his drill instructor.

162
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:41,513
- What a dumb jerk.
- Know what that stupid Beller says to me?

163
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:45,560
He says, "Private Jones, the Marine Corps
says you all got to be entertained.

164
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:47,424
It's good for your morale.

165
00:11:47,598 --> 00:11:50,931
All right, you dumb Yankees,
ain't you ever gonna learn?

166
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:54,935
Jones, throw out that chest!
Jones, ain't you got no chest?

167
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:56,572
All right, you dumb Yankees!

168
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,231
Can't you understand
American when it's spoke?

169
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,106
Mr. Christian, 10 lashes for them Yankees!

170
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,678
Lick the deck! Lick the..."

171
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:06,816
Don't bother me right now, boy.

172
00:12:06,984 --> 00:12:09,350
"I'll make you boys
feel sorry for the day..."

173
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,488
Attention!

174
00:12:14,425 --> 00:12:18,327
Gentlemen, don your buckets.

175
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,301
All right, what are you people?

176
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:27,164
We're skinheads.

177
00:12:27,338 --> 00:12:29,033
- What?
- Skinheads!

178
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,198
And stupid Yankees too!

179
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:36,777
And who do you love?

180
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:39,108
We love our Sergeant Beller!

181
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:41,615
Yes, sir!

182
00:12:47,324 --> 00:12:51,886
- There's that Indian love call again.
- It's the chow, sarge.

183
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:56,931
In all my 10 years in the Marine Corps,
this is the first time I've been stumped.

184
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:59,831
I still don't know who the bird is.

185
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:01,767
Well, I give up.

186
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:04,407
All right, take them off.

187
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,809
At ease.

188
00:13:13,784 --> 00:13:16,344
I just came over to tell you skinheads...

189
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,715
...that they're sending
a bunch of you out...

190
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:20,720
...to radio school.

191
00:13:25,062 --> 00:13:27,155
All right, one more thing.

192
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:31,595
You're gyrenes now.

193
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,999
And when you pass in review tomorrow...

194
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:36,571
...and do an eyes right...

195
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,470
...let me hear them eyeballs click.

196
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:46,406
Just call me Jim.

197
00:14:14,411 --> 00:14:15,935
<i>This was the day.</i>

198
00:14:16,113 --> 00:14:19,947
<i>To a man, their hearts pound,</i>
<i>nearly bursting with pride.</i>

199
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:24,713
<i>They had paid in sweat, humiliation and</i>
<i>a few tears for the name they now carried.</i>

200
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:28,449
<i>They were Marines now, and they would be</i>
<i>till the day they died.</i>

201
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,602
<i>This is me, Mac,</i>
<i>with the six chevrons.</i>

202
00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:22,473
<i>I'm communicator for this outfit.</i>

203
00:15:22,646 --> 00:15:24,944
<i>Major Wellman, the executive officer.</i>

204
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:29,848
<i>He gave up an ulcer job in civilian life</i>
<i>for another ulcer job in the Marine Corps.</i>

205
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,649
<i>Little Ziltch, a new kid,</i>
<i>the commander's orderly.</i>

206
00:15:33,824 --> 00:15:38,989
<i>And this is Major Sam Huxley, known</i>
<i>throughout the Corps as High Pockets.</i>

207
00:15:39,163 --> 00:15:41,529
<i>He's now in command</i>
<i>of the 2nd Battalion.</i>

208
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:44,064
<i>I've served with Huxley</i>
<i>off and on for years.</i>

209
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:49,171
<i>If there's one man who can build</i>
<i>a fighting battalion, you're looking at him.</i>

210
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:51,569
- Mac.
- Yes, sir.

211
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,677
- Take charge. Get them squared away.
- Yes, sir.

212
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:58,844
Bob, get them bedded down.

213
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:01,416
Left face!

214
00:16:02,286 --> 00:16:04,447
Arms, huh!

215
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:08,219
Forward, huh!

216
00:16:08,392 --> 00:16:11,259
Rest easy. The smoking lamp's lit.

217
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:15,455
I called you men together because
I know we're all thinking the same thing.

218
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:17,967
These new boys we're getting...

219
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:21,036
...they may look like Marines
and talk like Marines...

220
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:23,435
...but we know the truth.

221
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,209
In other words,
we've got problems.

222
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:29,709
We've also got a war on our hands.

223
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,182
Now, we all have buddies on wait
in the Philippines and Shanghai.

224
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:38,312
It's gonna be a long road back.

225
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:42,719
And we can't get back without them.

226
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:45,827
You know I'm going to train them...

227
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:50,626
...so that every private in this battalion
can take command if he has to.

228
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:54,502
The only way I can do that
is with your help.

229
00:16:54,938 --> 00:16:57,736
Thank you. That will be all.

230
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,341
<i>The man said he wanted communicators,</i>
<i>and I said he'd have them.</i>

231
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:11,248
<i>Every minute they weren't in the field,</i>
<i>I had them at the practice table.</i>

232
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:16,484
<i>Inside three weeks, they could read code</i>
<i>in their sleep. And probably did.</i>

233
00:17:28,772 --> 00:17:31,536
Come on, snap out of it.
What, you got the blues?

234
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,233
This place gives me the creeps on Sunday.

235
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:35,639
Forget about it, Danny.

236
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:39,111
Monkey with a broad, you wind up
on the short end of the stick.

237
00:17:39,283 --> 00:17:42,184
- None of them are worth it.
- Save the advice, chaplain.

238
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,650
Thought I'd give the benefit
of my experience.

239
00:17:44,821 --> 00:17:47,722
I want to be there when you fall
for some nice girl.

240
00:17:47,891 --> 00:17:51,122
A broad ain't been made yet
that'll make old Andy fall.

241
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:55,789
- Let's go ashore and get out of this hole.
- Good idea.

242
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:58,694
We're going on liberty.
How about coming along?

243
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,860
I gotta finish ironing these shirts.

244
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,371
Ski, they've got a town out here
full of beautiful tomatoes.

245
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,339
You ain't been on liberty
since we've been in the Corps.

246
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:10,207
I got a chance to pick up
extra bucks pressing.

247
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,712
I've gotta save my dough
to get Susan out here.

248
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,046
If it's a dame you want out here,
I'll lend you the dough.

249
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:18,847
Thanks anyway,
but I don't want no charity.

250
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:21,115
It's your life.

251
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:25,489
Eat your heart out, feather merchant,
eat your heart out.

252
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:31,057
I'll murder Mac and Huxley.
They got no respect for communicators.

253
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:34,533
That lousy Mac had me shoveling garbage
again today.

254
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:36,832
Me! I'm writing my congressman.

255
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:41,239
Me and the Corps have split the blanket.
That's Navajo for finished, done.

256
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:45,108
That's right. Huxley's trying to kill us.
Ten straight 15-mile hikes.

257
00:18:45,282 --> 00:18:48,217
You know what they call this outfit?
"Huxley's Harlots."

258
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:52,788
And if we ain't hiking, we're getting
dit-happy on that signal key.

259
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:57,754
Maybe I should learn Mac
how to use smoke signals.

260
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,559
What's Crazy Horse beefing about?

261
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:09,138
He says he's a son of a Indian chief,
and he wants to go back to the reservation.

262
00:19:09,306 --> 00:19:12,366
Tell that man there'll be
no swearing here on Sunday.

263
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,874
I wonder who's stuck
with guard duty tonight.

264
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,515
I think I see your name up there.

265
00:19:22,252 --> 00:19:24,743
Put it back, Joseph.

266
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:27,118
I was just going to borrow it.

267
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,987
The last time you borrowed something,
I never saw it again.

268
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:38,929
Hey, you accusing me
of something dishonest?

269
00:19:39,102 --> 00:19:41,832
Just put it back, please.

270
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,404
You think you're so smart
because you read all the time.

271
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:53,782
I ain't liked you since boot camp.

272
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,582
I've got a notion to loosen you
from a few teeth...

273
00:19:57,754 --> 00:19:59,984
...Sister Mary.

274
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:10,628
Now, wait a minute.
I was only fooling with you.

275
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:26,610
What'd you go and do that for?

276
00:20:26,783 --> 00:20:30,446
I saw what happened to one fellow
who tried to shake your hand.

277
00:20:47,637 --> 00:20:50,868
That was a lucky punch.
You know that, huh?

278
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:55,741
You're the only guy alive
who can do that to old Spanish Joe...

279
00:20:55,912 --> 00:20:58,380
...and live to tell about it.

280
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,376
What you reading?

281
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,488
Plato.

282
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:10,592
You mean they wrote a whole big book
about Mickey Mouse's dog?

283
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:13,422
You know something?

284
00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:15,428
I like you, Mary.

285
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,035
You stick with me
and I'll get you over the rough spots.

286
00:21:19,202 --> 00:21:22,399
What you think of old Spanish Joe now?

287
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:26,167
I think you're
the most obnoxious person I ever met.

288
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:30,571
What's that, obnoxious?

289
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,339
You stink.

290
00:21:34,217 --> 00:21:37,050
That's because
I was eating garlic.

291
00:21:37,487 --> 00:21:40,456
Hey, kid, you got guts.

292
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:43,616
You and me's going to be buddy-buddy.

293
00:22:00,877 --> 00:22:02,811
Thanks, Mac.

294
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:18,657
Don't do that with my hat!
What's the matter with you?

295
00:22:18,828 --> 00:22:21,820
Miss, would you please
pick it up for me?

296
00:22:25,402 --> 00:22:26,869
All right. What'll you have?

297
00:22:27,037 --> 00:22:29,403
Give me a cheeseburger
and a cup of coffee.

298
00:22:29,573 --> 00:22:32,974
And how about a piece
of that apple pie too?

299
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:36,403
What's yours?

300
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,174
I think I'll have something different.

301
00:22:39,349 --> 00:22:42,716
My name's Andy.
What time you getting off duty?

302
00:22:42,886 --> 00:22:44,683
I have just two words for you.

303
00:22:44,854 --> 00:22:47,880
Remind me to tell you
what they are later.

304
00:22:48,124 --> 00:22:49,682
Why not now?

305
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:52,293
Later's always better.

306
00:22:54,097 --> 00:22:55,928
- What are you doing?
- Looking for Ski.

307
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:57,430
- He cracked up.
- What happened?

308
00:22:57,601 --> 00:23:02,231
- He got a letter and tore the barracks apart.
- He went crazy and threw his bed at me.

309
00:23:02,405 --> 00:23:07,274
He drew all the money he had stashed away,
over $400, and headed into San Diego.

310
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:09,844
Mac's looking for him.
He told us to wait here.

311
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,573
Something must've gone wrong
with his girl, Susan.

312
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:15,684
- We found him. Come on.
- Let's go.

313
00:23:18,622 --> 00:23:21,785
Here's a couple of bucks.
I'll see you later.

314
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:33,866
Is he still in there?

315
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,902
Okay.

316
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:42,477
That's the kind of joint this is.
If he ain't in the bar, he's upstairs.

317
00:23:42,646 --> 00:23:46,104
We don't want no trouble.
But, just in case, get your belts ready.

318
00:23:46,283 --> 00:23:48,308
Let's go, sailors.

319
00:23:50,754 --> 00:23:53,188
Can I help you fellows?

320
00:23:53,556 --> 00:23:56,491
We're looking for a buddy of ours,
a Marine PFC.

321
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,458
- He's a little loaded. You seen him?
- He ain't here.

322
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:02,655
He come in here 10 minutes ago,
and he ain't come out yet.

323
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:04,663
- Mind if we take a look?
- Wait!

324
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:06,802
I said he ain't here!

325
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:15,771
- I guess maybe we made a mistake.
- Yeah.

326
00:24:15,945 --> 00:24:18,038
Thanks a lot.

327
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:59,084
Excuse me, please.
Thank you, thank you.

328
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:17,566
- Let's go, kid. Get up.
- Hold on.

329
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:20,904
- Come on, you gotta get out of here.
- Leave me alone!

330
00:25:21,077 --> 00:25:24,513
- This is my life. I'll do what I want with it!
- Come on.

331
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:33,350
- She rolled him.
- Where's his dough?

332
00:25:33,523 --> 00:25:35,013
Where's his dough?

333
00:25:35,191 --> 00:25:36,590
I got it.

334
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,457
- She's gone.
- It's all right. It's all right.

335
00:25:44,267 --> 00:25:47,703
Dear John letter. She's gonna
have a baby. She got married.

336
00:25:47,871 --> 00:25:50,465
See what happens when
you fall for one broad?

337
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,040
Let's get him out of here.
Come on, come on!

338
00:25:54,878 --> 00:25:56,345
She's gone.

339
00:26:06,156 --> 00:26:07,418
Sir.

340
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:10,054
We lost contact with Fox Company.

341
00:26:10,226 --> 00:26:13,127
Soon as the boys finish chow,
I'll have them run a line up.

342
00:26:13,296 --> 00:26:14,888
All right.

343
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:18,761
- You got your Indians working?
- Yes, sir. Right over here.

344
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,554
Lighttower and his all-Navajo network.

345
00:26:42,725 --> 00:26:44,488
That Huxley's really a smart boy.

346
00:26:44,661 --> 00:26:47,653
He's gonna foul up the Japs
so they can't intercept our messages.

347
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:51,892
Seems that he read someplace that
they used Sioux talkers in World War I.

348
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:55,504
You can stop. We know you're reading
High Pockets the Riot Act.

349
00:26:55,672 --> 00:26:58,607
Mr. Jones, I hate to interrupt
your meal hour...

350
00:26:58,775 --> 00:27:04,873
...but when you finish feeding your face,
I want you to run a line up to Fox Company.

351
00:27:05,048 --> 00:27:09,314
Yes, sir. Right, sir.
On the double, sir.

352
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:13,820
Come on. If I don't get this dame's sister
a date, I'll be out in the cold.

353
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,457
No, thanks.

354
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:18,890
Man, you're the limit.
You gotta loosen up sometimes.

355
00:27:19,062 --> 00:27:21,394
I enjoy myself on liberty.

356
00:27:21,564 --> 00:27:24,965
- What do you do?
- Ride the San Diego Coronado Ferryboat.

357
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,368
You what?

358
00:27:27,537 --> 00:27:28,970
Take a boat ride.

359
00:27:29,138 --> 00:27:32,039
You ought to try it sometime, Andy.
It's very pleasant.

360
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:34,301
It gives me a chance to think.

361
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:39,371
I might write a book
about all this one of these days.

362
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:42,712
You ride the Coronado Ferry.

363
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,055
Marion, believe me,
I think you will write that book.

364
00:28:06,543 --> 00:28:10,343
Excuse me.
I don't seem to have a light.

365
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:15,443
Thanks.

366
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:21,154
Don't think I'm forward,
but I've seen you here before.

367
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:25,260
I travel to Coronado every night.
You're almost getting to be a fixture.

368
00:28:25,428 --> 00:28:27,555
I was curious.

369
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,426
It's quiet here. I can think.

370
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,965
Lonesome?

371
00:28:32,135 --> 00:28:33,762
No, not really.

372
00:28:33,937 --> 00:28:36,804
I'll bet you're thinking about a girl.

373
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,505
I haven't got a girl.

374
00:28:39,742 --> 00:28:44,145
No man has a girl back home
when he's talking to a girl in San Diego.

375
00:28:44,414 --> 00:28:47,440
Look, lady, I'm not one of those guys.

376
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:51,075
There are things that mean more to me
than a brief conversation.

377
00:28:51,254 --> 00:28:53,415
I'll bet you really don't have a girl.

378
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,421
I said I didn't.

379
00:28:55,592 --> 00:28:58,686
Forgive me.
I shouldn't have bothered you.

380
00:28:58,861 --> 00:29:00,294
Miss?

381
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:04,463
I'm sorry.
It's sort of hard to explain.

382
00:29:04,634 --> 00:29:09,094
But being out here, for me,
well, I can think. Things make sense.

383
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:12,435
That rat race back there's
almost another world.

384
00:29:14,444 --> 00:29:16,412
What do you think about, Marine?

385
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,783
I think about how I'd like to write
about the war and this city and the guys.

386
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,988
I suppose you think
I'm off my rocker.

387
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:29,716
- How old are you?
- Nineteen.

388
00:29:29,892 --> 00:29:32,156
A completely honest gyrene.

389
00:29:32,328 --> 00:29:35,661
You're one for the books. You should have
said 25 to impress me.

390
00:29:35,832 --> 00:29:37,697
Is it a crime to be 19?

391
00:29:41,337 --> 00:29:42,463
Miss?

392
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:45,601
My name's Marion, Marion Hotchkiss.

393
00:29:45,775 --> 00:29:49,802
You said you take this boat often.
Maybe I'll see you again.

394
00:29:49,979 --> 00:29:51,844
Could be.

395
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:12,701
Try your skill here.
Ten shots for a quarter.

396
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:16,999
Everybody wins here.
Ten shots for a quarter here.

397
00:30:37,694 --> 00:30:40,822
- Give me a bourbon and Scotch.
- What?

398
00:30:40,997 --> 00:30:44,592
Well, just give me what that guy's got.

399
00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:18,457
I'm gonna tell you, buddy.

400
00:31:18,634 --> 00:31:21,762
I'm gonna tell you,
I don't like Huxley.

401
00:31:22,205 --> 00:31:26,574
He's a nice guy, I know, I know,
but I don't like him, see?

402
00:31:26,743 --> 00:31:29,007
You know, I don't like this lousy town.

403
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,646
I don't like the people in it, see?

404
00:31:31,814 --> 00:31:33,372
I like people.

405
00:31:35,284 --> 00:31:38,549
I like people who likes me, see?

406
00:31:38,721 --> 00:31:43,590
All the people here cares about
is your money. Lousy, rotten money.

407
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:46,827
Did I ever tell you about Kathy?

408
00:31:46,996 --> 00:31:51,990
She's my girl. She's a character,
but she's cute.

409
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:16,520
Feeling better?

410
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:19,492
Where am I?

411
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,064
You'd better take this.

412
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,904
- How did I get here?
- You're at the USO.

413
00:32:32,074 --> 00:32:34,907
Some Marines dropped you off.

414
00:32:35,645 --> 00:32:37,806
Never again.

415
00:32:40,183 --> 00:32:42,378
Thanks a lot for...

416
00:32:42,552 --> 00:32:43,849
...for taking me in.

417
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:47,689
You'd better get back to camp.
Sleep it off.

418
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:55,629
I guess I'd better.

419
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,124
Thanks again, Ms...?

420
00:32:59,302 --> 00:33:01,429
Mrs. Yarborough.

421
00:33:04,574 --> 00:33:06,132
Thanks.

422
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:16,179
- Mrs. Yarborough?
- Yes?

423
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,383
I was wondering if you'd
walk me to the bus depot.

424
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:28,386
I'm sorry. I'm terribly busy.

425
00:33:29,232 --> 00:33:31,291
Can I ask you something?

426
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:35,426
I know working one of these clubs
you hear this all the time...

427
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,237
...but I haven't talked to a woman
for almost six months.

428
00:33:39,408 --> 00:33:41,603
I just thought that...

429
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:48,612
Wash up.

430
00:33:48,784 --> 00:33:50,547
I'll get my coat.

431
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:05,289
I had a crush on a football
player one time.

432
00:34:05,801 --> 00:34:09,464
How come you live in San Diego
and run the USO club?

433
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,504
The USO keeps me busy.

434
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:15,576
Vernon... Mr. Yarborough's
what you call a dollar-a-year man.

435
00:34:15,745 --> 00:34:17,076
He tours the Pacific.

436
00:34:17,246 --> 00:34:20,147
He only gets in a couple
of days a month.

437
00:34:20,549 --> 00:34:24,349
I found commuting from Illinois
pretty difficult these days...

438
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,923
...so I've sort of become
a Navy wife till the war's over.

439
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:33,187
Guess you have a pretty fancy place
in Arlington Heights.

440
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,331
It wasn't always that way,
I can tell you.

441
00:34:36,499 --> 00:34:39,935
I come from a family of nine girls.

442
00:34:40,636 --> 00:34:42,661
Well, let's not fall into a dirge.

443
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:47,172
Say, young man, USO has a hayride
every Friday night.

444
00:34:47,343 --> 00:34:50,642
I highly recommend it
instead of getting drunk.

445
00:34:50,813 --> 00:34:52,280
Cigarette?

446
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:56,715
- I shouldn't smoke on the street.
- Go on.

447
00:35:22,945 --> 00:35:24,708
I'd better go back.

448
00:35:25,448 --> 00:35:28,417
You're not sorry.
Neither am I.

449
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:32,649
I don't know what got into me.
I've got to go back.

450
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:35,615
I'll see you Friday.

451
00:35:45,267 --> 00:35:48,703
- All right, try it.
- Nothing coming in.

452
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:52,799
I tell you, it's completely gone, Mac.

453
00:35:52,975 --> 00:35:56,035
- Fix it.
- Fix it?!

454
00:35:58,514 --> 00:36:00,948
Sir, the TD Y's on the blink again.

455
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,642
- Keep some runners handy.
- They're standing by.

456
00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:06,947
Them radios aren't worth
the tubes they're made of.

457
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:10,581
Do you feel you're incapable of operating
with the present equipment?

458
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,593
None of my equipment would've
helped Custer at Little Bighorn.

459
00:36:13,763 --> 00:36:17,927
Sergeant, we're also carrying
small arms from World War I.

460
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,467
Now, I'm not going through
our present equipment roster.

461
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,935
But you keep one thing in mind:

462
00:36:24,106 --> 00:36:27,075
Until we're issued new gear,
we'll get 100% efficiency...

463
00:36:27,243 --> 00:36:29,438
...out of every last piece
we have now.

464
00:36:29,612 --> 00:36:33,912
And we'll train these men in such a manner
as to overcome faults in the equipment.

465
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,147
- Is that clear?
- Very clear.

466
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:38,616
- Are you the communicator on this lash-up?
- Yes, sir.

467
00:36:38,788 --> 00:36:41,757
Well, then start communicating.

468
00:36:53,035 --> 00:36:54,798
That's it.

469
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:58,262
It's a beautiful story, Marion.

470
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:00,102
Do you really like it?

471
00:37:00,276 --> 00:37:02,301
Very much.

472
00:37:03,979 --> 00:37:07,107
I like meeting you here every liberty.

473
00:37:07,283 --> 00:37:09,251
I like talking to you.

474
00:37:09,418 --> 00:37:10,908
Me too.

475
00:37:14,123 --> 00:37:17,991
Let me tell you something
about my writing these stories.

476
00:37:18,427 --> 00:37:20,987
Just being with you,
it's untied a lot of knots.

477
00:37:21,163 --> 00:37:22,596
Don't.

478
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:27,362
Don't stop me now.
I don't get this brave very often.

479
00:37:28,737 --> 00:37:32,537
Rae, I just never could write
until I met you.

480
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,970
Does that sound funny?

481
00:37:36,412 --> 00:37:39,643
You're a sweet kid.
You'll be a big writer someday.

482
00:37:40,983 --> 00:37:42,382
Yeah.

483
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,920
Rae, how about our meeting
in San Diego next liberty?

484
00:37:47,256 --> 00:37:49,724
We can have dinner and take in a show.

485
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,190
Couldn't we go on just meeting here?

486
00:37:52,361 --> 00:37:56,525
We've been seeing each other for a month,
but it's always here on the ferry.

487
00:37:56,699 --> 00:37:58,724
I can't.

488
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,062
What do you mean you can't?

489
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,296
I just can't.

490
00:38:05,141 --> 00:38:07,575
I thought you liked me.

491
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:10,177
Of course I like you, Marion.

492
00:38:10,346 --> 00:38:14,578
Would I sit here until dawn
every time you were in if I didn't?

493
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,608
Yeah.

494
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,346
If you want to make
a big secret of it, I...

495
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:25,454
- I guess I'd better shove.
- Marion?

496
00:38:26,395 --> 00:38:29,159
Will you be here next liberty?

497
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:32,061
Yes.

498
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,770
I'll be here.

499
00:38:50,653 --> 00:38:52,280
Goodness, that was fun.

500
00:38:52,454 --> 00:38:55,389
I haven't been on a hayride
in years.

501
00:38:58,394 --> 00:38:59,725
Come on in.

502
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:09,237
- May I fix you a drink?
- I gave it up for hayrides, remember?

503
00:39:09,405 --> 00:39:10,872
Oh, yes.

504
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,567
If you'll excuse me a minute,
I think I'll freshen up.

505
00:39:33,963 --> 00:39:36,227
This darn hay is driving me nuts.

506
00:39:36,398 --> 00:39:40,266
Sorry. I felt kind of itchy.

507
00:39:42,805 --> 00:39:45,933
A buddy of mine back at the base
reads a lot.

508
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:48,872
I'll bet he's read all those books.

509
00:39:50,713 --> 00:39:53,181
Nice place you've got here.

510
00:39:53,382 --> 00:39:55,612
Got a pool too, huh?

511
00:39:55,784 --> 00:39:58,651
Won't you change your mind
about that drink?

512
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,383
I guess I better shove off for camp.

513
00:40:10,332 --> 00:40:12,095
Will I...?

514
00:40:12,268 --> 00:40:14,896
Will I see you tomorrow night?

515
00:40:16,538 --> 00:40:18,096
I shouldn't.

516
00:40:22,244 --> 00:40:25,008
Oh, all right. I'll see you.

517
00:40:26,515 --> 00:40:29,712
You should have fun like this more often.

518
00:40:30,152 --> 00:40:32,347
I've been too busy.

519
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,755
With all this, I...

520
00:40:35,924 --> 00:40:38,757
I guess you have everything.

521
00:40:39,928 --> 00:40:42,522
I have everything I want, Danny.

522
00:40:42,698 --> 00:40:45,792
I had nothing before I met my husband.

523
00:40:48,437 --> 00:40:50,598
Everything?

524
00:41:16,832 --> 00:41:18,732
Do you know, I...

525
00:41:18,901 --> 00:41:20,960
I think I will take that drink.

526
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,868
This darn hay is driving me nuts.

527
00:41:30,746 --> 00:41:33,647
I know how we can get rid of it.

528
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:36,483
Let's take a dip in the pool.

529
00:41:37,186 --> 00:41:39,450
I haven't got a suit.

530
00:41:39,688 --> 00:41:41,121
Besides...

531
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,848
Here.

532
00:41:44,326 --> 00:41:48,023
Those are Vernon's. Put them on.
I'll be out in a jiffy.

533
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:54,465
Listen, I gotta get back to the base.

534
00:41:54,636 --> 00:41:56,103
I'll drive you back.

535
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:02,171
Don't forget my drink.

536
00:42:02,344 --> 00:42:03,936
Scotch over ice.

537
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,407
If I don't get back on time,
I'll be peeling spuds for two years.

538
00:42:09,118 --> 00:42:11,143
What is it, dear?

539
00:42:12,087 --> 00:42:13,952
I said...

540
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,987
Never mind.

541
00:42:31,306 --> 00:42:33,900
- Ready?
- All clear.

542
00:42:42,751 --> 00:42:47,120
For a dollar-a-year man,
I'd say Vernon eats pretty well.

543
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,680
Come on.

544
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:53,595
Wait a minute, not so fast!
I'm liable to lose these.

545
00:42:56,799 --> 00:42:58,494
I'll call you.

546
00:43:00,669 --> 00:43:02,102
I'm in.

547
00:43:04,506 --> 00:43:06,269
All right.

548
00:43:06,442 --> 00:43:08,307
Three aces.

549
00:43:08,844 --> 00:43:10,436
Who owns this deck of cards?

550
00:43:10,612 --> 00:43:12,409
I do.

551
00:43:13,315 --> 00:43:15,476
You accusing me
of something dishonest?

552
00:43:15,651 --> 00:43:18,211
You got three aces, I got three aces.

553
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,412
And I got one too.

554
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:24,150
- Catch him!
- Catch him!

555
00:43:24,326 --> 00:43:26,760
- Catch him!
- Catch him!

556
00:43:40,175 --> 00:43:43,872
All right, Forrester, you're relieved.
Wait a minute.

557
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,409
I want to talk to you.

558
00:43:49,952 --> 00:43:53,718
You know, it took me
four years to make PFC.

559
00:43:53,889 --> 00:43:56,016
You made it in three months.

560
00:43:56,191 --> 00:43:58,716
I had you figured for a bright boy.

561
00:43:58,894 --> 00:44:03,524
But for the last month, you've smelled up
every radio you've operated.

562
00:44:03,832 --> 00:44:07,393
Now, do you want to tell me
what's going on in San Diego?

563
00:44:07,569 --> 00:44:11,335
- It's none of your business.
- It is when it affects your work.

564
00:44:11,507 --> 00:44:14,203
And when you go into town
on fake liberty passes.

565
00:44:14,376 --> 00:44:16,674
Who do you think you're snowing?

566
00:44:16,845 --> 00:44:18,642
All right. I'll do better.

567
00:44:18,814 --> 00:44:20,179
You'll have to.

568
00:44:20,716 --> 00:44:23,412
The major got a letter
from your father.

569
00:44:23,585 --> 00:44:26,679
You haven't written your family
in over a month.

570
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:31,851
It might be a good idea to let them know
whether you're alive or dead.

571
00:44:32,027 --> 00:44:34,495
Are you ordering me to write?

572
00:44:36,164 --> 00:44:41,261
The major's arranged for you to talk to
your family long distance tonight at 8:30.

573
00:44:41,436 --> 00:44:44,030
Sharp. Be there.

574
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,009
Now, go get some chow.

575
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:04,848
Hello?

576
00:45:06,128 --> 00:45:07,857
- Hello?
- Son.

577
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:10,464
- Hello, son.
- Hello, Dad.

578
00:45:10,632 --> 00:45:14,693
- Are you all right?
- Dad, I'm fine, just fine.

579
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:18,601
- Well, is anything wrong out there?
- No. No.

580
00:45:18,774 --> 00:45:21,470
I'm sorry about not writing.

581
00:45:21,643 --> 00:45:23,372
I'll get a letter off tonight.

582
00:45:23,545 --> 00:45:25,877
We were kind of worried.

583
00:45:26,381 --> 00:45:28,474
- Is Mother there?
- I sent her to a show.

584
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:30,982
I wanted to be sure
everything was all right.

585
00:45:31,153 --> 00:45:34,680
Son, there's someone here
who wants to talk to you.

586
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,287
Hello, Danny.

587
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,555
Kathy?

588
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:43,663
Kathy, I...

589
00:45:43,832 --> 00:45:45,732
Danny, I...

590
00:45:45,901 --> 00:45:48,927
It's still the same way with me.

591
00:45:50,272 --> 00:45:52,502
Kitten, honey...

592
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:56,869
Kitten, I love you.

593
00:45:57,379 --> 00:46:00,109
I love you too, Danny.

594
00:46:03,652 --> 00:46:05,552
Major Huxley, sir?

595
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,949
Come in, Mac.

596
00:46:07,122 --> 00:46:11,081
Forrester's furlough papers
are ready for your signature, sir.

597
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:15,319
Thank you.

598
00:46:21,803 --> 00:46:24,829
You don't like this, do you?
Giving this boy a furlough?

599
00:46:25,374 --> 00:46:27,842
That's not for me to decide, sir.

600
00:46:30,145 --> 00:46:31,737
Sit down, Mac.

601
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:36,716
You and I have been soldiering
for a long time.

602
00:46:36,885 --> 00:46:41,049
Long enough to know that we're
in the loneliest business in the world.

603
00:46:42,024 --> 00:46:44,151
But these kids...

604
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:48,961
Mac, a lonely boy
can get into trouble.

605
00:46:49,131 --> 00:46:52,430
I know that a few weeks at home
can straighten him out.

606
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:56,867
- I think it will too, sir.
- Remember, these kids aren't professionals.

607
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,135
Their reason for being here is different
than ours. They're wartime people.

608
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:05,210
But I believe we can make them the kind
of Marines we've got to have.

609
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,712
It's not the furlough, sir.

610
00:47:09,985 --> 00:47:11,782
Let's have it, Mac.

611
00:47:12,354 --> 00:47:14,117
Sure, major.

612
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,018
May I speak freely?

613
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,320
Please do.

614
00:47:19,494 --> 00:47:23,362
I've been soldiering long enough to know
a commander can't get involved...

615
00:47:23,532 --> 00:47:27,263
...in the personal lives of his men.
Nobody's that strong.

616
00:47:27,436 --> 00:47:30,234
You're going to end up
tearing your heart out.

617
00:47:34,843 --> 00:47:38,370
- Process these papers.
- Yes, sir.

618
00:47:54,796 --> 00:47:56,764
I'm sorry I'm late.

619
00:47:58,633 --> 00:48:00,692
I should be angry.

620
00:48:01,636 --> 00:48:06,232
I waited last night too.
An hour at the gate.

621
00:48:06,408 --> 00:48:08,740
It was impossible for me
to get liberty.

622
00:48:11,113 --> 00:48:13,138
Is anything wrong?

623
00:48:17,419 --> 00:48:19,887
I said, is anything wrong?

624
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:25,787
Why didn't you come last night?

625
00:48:26,161 --> 00:48:28,322
I had to study.

626
00:48:28,764 --> 00:48:30,425
Besides, I...

627
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:34,592
- I was broke.
- You know that doesn't make any difference.

628
00:48:35,403 --> 00:48:37,496
It does to me.

629
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,866
We're washed-up, aren't we?

630
00:48:49,618 --> 00:48:51,882
It completes the circle.

631
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:57,348
Danny Forrester,
all-American boy.

632
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:01,559
I knew you'd catch up to yourself
sooner or later.

633
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,091
The little girl back home?

634
00:49:04,266 --> 00:49:05,995
Kathy?

635
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,259
Yes.

636
00:49:11,173 --> 00:49:14,802
- You think I'm a tramp, don't you, Danny?
- No.

637
00:49:14,976 --> 00:49:16,375
Don't be nice.

638
00:49:17,479 --> 00:49:21,176
Any guy in the world would be lucky
to have you for a wife.

639
00:49:21,783 --> 00:49:23,580
It's just one of those things...

640
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:27,518
...that wouldn't have happened
if the world was in its right senses.

641
00:49:28,089 --> 00:49:29,954
Right senses.

642
00:49:31,092 --> 00:49:33,720
That's the trouble with me.

643
00:49:34,062 --> 00:49:37,657
I've always been in my right senses.

644
00:49:38,233 --> 00:49:41,669
I'm a clubwoman in her right senses.

645
00:49:44,306 --> 00:49:47,036
Know what I was going to do
when you told me this?

646
00:49:47,242 --> 00:49:50,678
I was going to make a fight for you.

647
00:49:52,881 --> 00:49:55,008
For a while there,
nothing mattered to me:

648
00:49:55,183 --> 00:49:57,413
My home. My husband.
The life I've trained for.

649
00:49:57,586 --> 00:50:00,054
Elaine, please don't.

650
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,690
Tonight?

651
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:11,524
It's farewell?

652
00:50:19,107 --> 00:50:22,702
Maybe I'll go out and get drunk.

653
00:50:23,612 --> 00:50:27,844
Maybe some other Marine
will take pity on me.

654
00:50:53,608 --> 00:50:57,169
- How about a cup of coffee?
- You're up early this morning.

655
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,370
I came in to see you.

656
00:50:59,547 --> 00:51:01,447
Didn't think you'd make it.

657
00:51:01,616 --> 00:51:05,017
- Hey, where's your good-looking buddy?
- You mean Danny?

658
00:51:05,186 --> 00:51:08,815
The jerk got lonesome for his gal
and went back to Baltimore.

659
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:11,220
Oh, yeah. Baltimore.

660
00:51:11,393 --> 00:51:13,884
That's where the oysters
come from, isn't it?

661
00:51:14,062 --> 00:51:16,792
You know what oysters
are good for, don't you?

662
00:51:16,965 --> 00:51:18,694
Vitamins.

663
00:51:19,334 --> 00:51:21,029
Too bad we haven't got any.

664
00:51:21,202 --> 00:51:23,932
Try some eggs.
They're just as good.

665
00:51:31,179 --> 00:51:35,377
Ruby, why don't you and me go to
Mission Beach? I'll teach you how to dive.

666
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,883
- More tricks?
- Yeah.

667
00:51:46,594 --> 00:51:48,061
That sure was good, Mom.

668
00:51:48,229 --> 00:51:50,925
I've heard terrible stories
about what they fed you.

669
00:51:51,099 --> 00:51:53,431
It's a wonder you gained weight.

670
00:51:55,003 --> 00:51:56,903
I'll gather these dishes.

671
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,131
I've got to show the kids
my Marine hat...

672
00:51:59,307 --> 00:52:02,799
...and tell them you rode home
in a Flying Fortress.

673
00:52:02,978 --> 00:52:06,812
- Well, are you smoking now, son?
- I'm full of vices.

674
00:52:06,982 --> 00:52:11,715
- It sure is great to be home, Dad.
- Well, good to have you back.

675
00:52:14,055 --> 00:52:17,616
- Kathy know you're home yet?
- She wasn't expecting me till tomorrow.

676
00:52:17,792 --> 00:52:20,761
My catching a plane hop
was kind of lucky.

677
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:24,763
Here. Why don't you take the car
and run over and see her.

678
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,696
Thanks, Dad.

679
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,804
- Danny, I do love you.
- Kathy...

680
00:52:40,682 --> 00:52:44,209
It's all right, darling.
It's all right.

681
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,684
I'm sorry.

682
00:52:48,857 --> 00:52:51,189
We just got carried away.

683
00:52:55,597 --> 00:53:00,125
Remember the night we drove out this way
and went swimming in the moonlight?

684
00:53:05,073 --> 00:53:07,371
Come on.
Let's take a walk along the beach.

685
00:53:07,542 --> 00:53:11,239
- It looks wonderful!
- Kathy, come back. Stop acting like a baby.

686
00:53:11,413 --> 00:53:13,210
Fine Marine you turned out to be.

687
00:53:13,381 --> 00:53:17,044
- What, afraid to get your feet wet?
- Act your age, will you?

688
00:53:17,218 --> 00:53:20,619
Come on in. It's wonderful.
You big sissy!

689
00:53:20,789 --> 00:53:23,223
You're a coward! You're yellow!

690
00:53:24,459 --> 00:53:27,155
- Hey! You got me all wet!
- Chicken!

691
00:53:27,328 --> 00:53:29,694
I'll show you. You'll be sorry!

692
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,862
You've got to catch me first!

693
00:53:42,243 --> 00:53:46,976
Kitten, it's getting late.
We'd better go now.

694
00:53:47,148 --> 00:53:49,708
I don't want to go.

695
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,585
I don't ever want to go.

696
00:53:54,155 --> 00:53:57,022
Danny, we'll be so happy.

697
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,824
You're beautiful.

698
00:54:00,995 --> 00:54:03,486
I just love to look at you.

699
00:54:06,134 --> 00:54:08,364
Am I really beautiful?

700
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:11,528
I always want to look nice for you.

701
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,740
Keep on dreaming, will you?

702
00:54:16,511 --> 00:54:19,639
- Danny?
- What?

703
00:54:20,849 --> 00:54:24,683
Do you like me as well as
that girl in San Diego?

704
00:54:25,687 --> 00:54:27,518
It's all right, darling.

705
00:54:27,689 --> 00:54:30,522
I've known about it all the time.

706
00:54:30,692 --> 00:54:33,320
I knew when you didn't write.

707
00:54:33,862 --> 00:54:35,659
And I don't care.

708
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:38,424
I've got you now.

709
00:54:38,867 --> 00:54:41,768
There will never be another girl
anymore, Kathy.

710
00:54:41,936 --> 00:54:44,530
Never anyone but you.

711
00:54:44,706 --> 00:54:47,038
I love you.

712
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:49,438
I love you.

713
00:55:10,465 --> 00:55:13,662
Hector, if you had any gumption,
you'd go get your shotgun.

714
00:55:13,835 --> 00:55:15,029
Be quiet, Martha.

715
00:55:15,203 --> 00:55:19,196
I'm gonna see that the military authorities
take care of your son, Forrester!

716
00:55:19,374 --> 00:55:22,571
They may have been in an accident.

717
00:55:22,744 --> 00:55:25,235
It's my daughter. Remember that.
My daughter!

718
00:55:25,413 --> 00:55:27,381
Here they come now,
he's kissing her!

719
00:55:27,549 --> 00:55:30,916
Bud, go on upstairs now.
Get ready for school.

720
00:55:33,254 --> 00:55:34,744
Where have you two been?

721
00:55:34,923 --> 00:55:37,619
What have you done, son?
Shame, shame, shame!

722
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:40,784
- How could you have done this?
- I'll see you behind bars!

723
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:44,557
- I suggest we all lower our voices.
- I'm taking this to court!

724
00:55:44,732 --> 00:55:46,597
We didn't do anything wrong.

725
00:55:46,768 --> 00:55:48,963
No? You and your mother
wait in the car.

726
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,367
Mom, Dad, please!

727
00:55:51,539 --> 00:55:53,507
- We were married in Upton.
- What?!

728
00:55:53,675 --> 00:55:55,905
- We were married in Upton.
- Married?

729
00:55:56,077 --> 00:56:00,036
- You're not even dry behind the ears yet!
- But, Daddy, I love him.

730
00:56:00,215 --> 00:56:02,581
Heaven help us!

731
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,411
Oh, Mom.

732
00:56:16,731 --> 00:56:19,700
- You sent for me, sir.
- Yes, I sent for you.

733
00:56:20,034 --> 00:56:23,663
What have you got in that radio platoon
of yours, the battalion clowns?

734
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:28,275
- I'm afraid I don't understand the major.
- Then the major will explain.

735
00:56:28,443 --> 00:56:33,506
On every field problem, your boys get
the 3rd Battalion to lay miles of wire...

736
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:36,673
...and then they just sit back
and tap the lines...

737
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:39,411
...let the other guys do the work.

738
00:56:39,587 --> 00:56:43,318
Not only that, but they've fieldstripped
the 1 st Battalion's radio shack...

739
00:56:43,491 --> 00:56:45,857
...taken everything
that wasn't nailed down.

740
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:50,396
While the rest of the regiment
transmits dull, routine military messages...

741
00:56:50,565 --> 00:56:53,932
...your boys want to liven up the party
by sending limericks.

742
00:56:54,102 --> 00:56:57,230
They seem to be under the impression
we hold field problems...

743
00:56:57,405 --> 00:57:00,272
...just to allow them to express
their poetic souls.

744
00:57:00,441 --> 00:57:04,241
Now, listen to this.
This was decoded yesterday.

745
00:57:04,412 --> 00:57:09,145
Here's the answer Weapons Company got
when they sent an ammunition request:

746
00:57:09,317 --> 00:57:12,514
<i>There was an old sheep from Algiers</i>

747
00:57:12,687 --> 00:57:15,918
<i>Who said to his harem, "My dears</i>

748
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:17,921
<i>You may..."</i>

749
00:57:18,826 --> 00:57:21,886
There's nothing funny about this,
this is just plain filth!

750
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:26,557
I know it is. The first time I received
that message was in Shanghai in '31.

751
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:31,398
A young 2nd lieutenant sent it to me.
I believe his name was Huxley, sir.

752
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:36,670
Well, you ought to have him
show a little discretion.

753
00:57:36,844 --> 00:57:38,505
Tell him to use a better code.

754
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,275
If Regiment got ahold of this,
I might have trouble explaining it.

755
00:57:42,617 --> 00:57:46,383
- I'll square them away, sir.
- Okay, Mac.

756
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:55,719
They're shaping into a real outfit.
Beginning to look like Marines.

757
00:57:55,963 --> 00:57:57,624
Yes, sir.

758
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,837
- Shipping orders?
- That's it.

759
00:58:05,006 --> 00:58:07,736
Looks like we'll be shoving off
any day now.

760
00:58:07,909 --> 00:58:09,206
What do you think?

761
00:58:09,377 --> 00:58:12,778
Well, they've come a long way
in the last 30 days.

762
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:15,381
Of course, we could always
use more time.

763
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:18,576
Time is something
we're not going to be able to buy.

764
00:58:18,753 --> 00:58:21,313
The reports from Guadalcanal
look very bad.

765
00:58:21,489 --> 00:58:22,478
Yeah.

766
00:58:22,657 --> 00:58:24,852
Well, get your working parties
organized.

767
00:58:25,026 --> 00:58:27,927
- Give them all the liberty they can handle.
- Right.

768
00:58:28,096 --> 00:58:32,362
I guess I ought to run in to
San Diego a few hours, see the wife.

769
00:58:39,006 --> 00:58:40,837
You better produce broads.

770
00:58:41,008 --> 00:58:45,035
You think I'm dishonest?
Don't worry about it, I'll get them there.

771
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:49,275
The boys are really
gonna start celebrating.

772
00:58:49,751 --> 00:58:52,777
I wish I could go in
and get crocked with them.

773
00:58:52,954 --> 00:58:58,153
Sometimes I'd like to take off
these oak leaves and be a human being.

774
00:59:03,431 --> 00:59:07,128
Maybe you and I
could just shove off together, Sam.

775
00:59:07,301 --> 00:59:12,068
It's not the same thing as being
surrounded by your buddies.

776
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,471
You know, Wellman,
this uniform is the only thing...

777
00:59:15,643 --> 00:59:20,740
...that's ever really meant anything
to me, except Jean.

778
00:59:21,716 --> 00:59:24,184
I haven't been able to give her
much of a life.

779
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:27,048
She's married to a Marine, Sam.

780
00:59:28,756 --> 00:59:31,486
It's these last days I hate.

781
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:36,057
The anticipation starts,
and we both get quiet.

782
00:59:36,731 --> 00:59:41,191
I'll come in, she'll set the table.

783
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:45,203
We'll talk of small things,
pretending nothing's wrong.

784
00:59:46,707 --> 00:59:49,540
And then when the ship's loaded...

785
00:59:50,311 --> 00:59:52,506
...standing by...

786
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,874
Every morning when I leave her...

787
00:59:58,052 --> 01:00:02,011
...neither of us knowing
whether maybe this is the last time.

788
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:06,251
And then I go back again that evening.

789
01:00:07,261 --> 01:00:09,422
That look on her face
when I open the door...

790
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:16,357
Then we start pretending
all over again.

791
01:00:17,001 --> 01:00:19,663
Pretending that nothing's happening.

792
01:00:21,339 --> 01:00:24,433
But in the middle of the night,
she'll...

793
01:00:25,409 --> 01:00:27,741
She'll cry.

794
01:00:28,879 --> 01:00:33,043
She'll go into the next room
so I won't hear her.

795
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:39,317
I guess we should
be used to it by now.

796
01:00:41,659 --> 01:00:47,120
What is it that makes a woman
go on loving a man...

797
01:00:47,298 --> 01:00:51,166
...that she can't even claim
belongs to her?

798
01:01:06,417 --> 01:01:07,748
Hold on a minute, honey.

799
01:01:07,918 --> 01:01:11,479
Quiet, you guys!
This dame will think we're drunk!

800
01:01:11,656 --> 01:01:15,558
Why don't you pick up a couple
of gals and come over to the club?

801
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,221
I want to propose a toast
to the best outfit in the Marine Corps.

802
01:01:20,398 --> 01:01:22,832
Huxley's Hookers! Come on!

803
01:01:27,171 --> 01:01:28,604
Now you're a real outfit.

804
01:01:28,773 --> 01:01:32,368
And a toast to the girl who ain't
with us on our last beer bust:

805
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,534
Good old Danny Forrester!

806
01:01:34,712 --> 01:01:37,237
- I'll drink to that!
- I'm not gonna drink to that jerk!

807
01:01:37,415 --> 01:01:40,873
- Why not?
- Getting married! Wouldn't listen to Andy.

808
01:01:41,052 --> 01:01:44,215
- Wait till he gets in tomorrow!
- You should try it.

809
01:01:44,388 --> 01:01:48,518
Me and my faithful Indian companion here
have a terrific idea.

810
01:01:48,693 --> 01:01:52,925
We think we should all make a vow to have
a reunion when this here war is over!

811
01:01:53,097 --> 01:01:55,190
That's the most beautiful idea
I ever heard.

812
01:01:55,366 --> 01:02:00,030
We also think that we should be
blood brothers. Real blood brothers.

813
01:02:00,204 --> 01:02:04,265
Because blood brothers is thicker
than, than beer brothers.

814
01:02:04,442 --> 01:02:07,138
- Most beautiful idea I ever heard.
- Speedy, the knife.

815
01:02:07,511 --> 01:02:12,005
So's we can all cut our thumbs
and shake like a Navajo.

816
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:16,946
- Right in the meaty part.
- Cut it up. Cut it, cut it.

817
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:23,483
I guess it's not gonna work.
It's a good idea, but it's just...

818
01:02:24,195 --> 01:02:26,425
Okay, brother, let's have some blood.

819
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:31,996
Let's do it first thing tomorrow.

820
01:02:35,272 --> 01:02:36,739
Come on right over.

821
01:02:37,842 --> 01:02:40,902
- Bartender, bring them brews!
- Did you get those broads?

822
01:02:41,078 --> 01:02:43,376
Did I get them? They'll be right over.

823
01:02:43,547 --> 01:02:47,313
But remember, you guys, lay off
my personal babe. She's mine.

824
01:02:47,485 --> 01:02:50,977
Wait'll you see this number.
She's as good as she looks.

825
01:02:51,155 --> 01:02:52,816
Marion, come on, drink up.

826
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:57,450
Joe's got some broads coming over
with his personal recommendation.

827
01:02:57,628 --> 01:03:00,688
He don't drink, smoke or go out
with women. What's he live for?

828
01:03:00,865 --> 01:03:03,800
He lives for the Marine Corps, kid.

829
01:03:03,968 --> 01:03:05,526
Live it up, live it up!

830
01:03:07,138 --> 01:03:09,299
The broads are finally here!

831
01:03:09,473 --> 01:03:12,135
Hi, baby, how are you?

832
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:16,039
Sit down, I'll get you
a bottle of bourbon.

833
01:03:16,213 --> 01:03:19,011
Harry, double bourbon.

834
01:03:22,086 --> 01:03:25,681
This here is the only gal that can
make a Jerry lose his marbles.

835
01:03:25,856 --> 01:03:28,450
Spanish Joe's babe!

836
01:03:31,962 --> 01:03:33,862
Rae!

837
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:36,826
Marion.

838
01:03:47,378 --> 01:03:51,405
- Now what's the matter with him?
- Shut up!

839
01:04:06,497 --> 01:04:09,159
See what happens
when you fall for one dame?

840
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:11,961
Easy, Marion. Take it easy.

841
01:04:20,911 --> 01:04:24,677
<i>November 1942,</i>
<i>11 months after Pearl Harbor...</i>

842
01:04:24,849 --> 01:04:27,647
<i>... our battalion dropped anchor</i>
<i>in Wellington Bay.</i>

843
01:04:27,818 --> 01:04:32,619
<i>The fighting men of New Zealand</i>
<i>were far away in the Middle East...</i>

844
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:37,022
<i>... while their courageous country was armed</i>
<i>with not much more than pitchforks.</i>

845
01:04:37,194 --> 01:04:43,599
<i>And it was, quote, "Condition Black,</i>
<i>enemy invasion anticipated, " unquote.</i>

846
01:05:35,553 --> 01:05:39,319
<i>At Camp McKay, 30 miles outside</i>
<i>of Wellington, we set up for business.</i>

847
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:42,425
<i>From here on out, we would be</i>
<i>racing against the clock.</i>

848
01:05:42,593 --> 01:05:46,029
<i>For on another island miles to the north,</i>
<i>the 1 st Marine Division...</i>

849
01:05:46,196 --> 01:05:48,756
<i>... had taken the first step</i>
<i>of the long road back.</i>

850
01:05:52,336 --> 01:05:55,237
Major, whoever drew up
this training schedule is wacky.

851
01:05:55,406 --> 01:05:58,102
It calls for a hike tonight
and a 25-mile hike tomorrow.

852
01:05:58,275 --> 01:06:01,403
That's right, I drew up that schedule.

853
01:06:01,579 --> 01:06:06,482
But these boys have been cooped up aboard
ship for three weeks. That's a bit rough.

854
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:08,914
It's gonna get rougher
where we're going.

855
01:06:09,086 --> 01:06:11,714
First we're gonna
get this camp shipshape...

856
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:15,689
...then we're gonna work out the kinks
before anybody gets liberty.

857
01:06:20,998 --> 01:06:25,367
<i>High Pockets promised he'd work the kinks</i>
<i>out of us, and he kept his promise.</i>

858
01:06:25,536 --> 01:06:28,061
<i>The field problems ran day and night.</i>

859
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:32,368
<i>We were on the move from dawn to dusk</i>
<i>and back to dawn.</i>

860
01:06:35,613 --> 01:06:39,379
- Ready to move out, sir.
- Let's go.

861
01:06:56,033 --> 01:06:59,469
<i>And it was 10 long days before</i>
<i>he eased up and gave us liberty.</i>

862
01:06:59,637 --> 01:07:02,697
<i>The wonderful people of New Zealand</i>
<i>loved the kids in green...</i>

863
01:07:02,873 --> 01:07:06,639
<i>... and to us, well,</i>
<i>it was almost like home.</i>

864
01:07:16,654 --> 01:07:18,679
He's full of whiskey and donuts.

865
01:07:18,856 --> 01:07:21,825
You gotta stop acting like this,
you'll get shipped out.

866
01:07:21,992 --> 01:07:23,482
Marion snapped out of it.

867
01:07:23,661 --> 01:07:27,427
You smell up the network every time
you're on radio. Wise up to yourself!

868
01:07:27,598 --> 01:07:31,830
Go on. You guys slobber over me
like I'm a 10-year-old. Leave me alone.

869
01:07:32,002 --> 01:07:35,597
Sober him up on that stuff
before the MPs get to him.

870
01:07:47,017 --> 01:07:49,611
- What would you like, please?
- A cup of joe...

871
01:07:49,787 --> 01:07:52,312
...and one of them crumpet things.

872
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:55,390
My name's Andy Hookens.
I didn't catch yours.

873
01:07:55,559 --> 01:07:56,583
I didn't throw it.

874
01:07:57,061 --> 01:07:58,824
Nice country you got here.

875
01:07:58,996 --> 01:08:02,898
I'm from Washington state.
Not to be confused with the capitol.

876
01:08:03,067 --> 01:08:05,160
I know.
Lots of trees in Washington.

877
01:08:05,335 --> 01:08:07,769
I'm the boy who chopped
most of them down.

878
01:08:07,938 --> 01:08:11,271
A modest Yank. Well, well.
Excuse me.

879
01:08:11,442 --> 01:08:14,639
Don't flit off again, honey.
I'd like some more coffee.

880
01:08:14,812 --> 01:08:18,009
- Are you persistent too?
- I never let go.

881
01:08:18,182 --> 01:08:22,414
- You're fighting a losing battle, you know.
- The story of my life.

882
01:08:25,055 --> 01:08:29,515
- You can't score with that one, buddy.
- Just move over and give me some room.

883
01:08:29,693 --> 01:08:35,290
- That's Pat Rogers. Mrs. Pat Rogers.
- You shouldn't let that scare you, junior.

884
01:08:38,068 --> 01:08:40,195
Are you still here?

885
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:44,431
You know, you're hurting my morale.
I've met nothing but nice people here.

886
01:08:44,608 --> 01:08:47,099
Aren't you gonna be nice to me too?

887
01:08:47,277 --> 01:08:49,939
- You're fresh.
- And lonesome too.

888
01:08:50,114 --> 01:08:53,208
I was just thinking of a nice,
quiet evening of...

889
01:08:53,383 --> 01:08:55,010
...of movies and dancing.

890
01:08:55,185 --> 01:08:57,244
Does that ring a bell?

891
01:08:57,421 --> 01:09:00,788
But there are lots of girls
about the canteen dying to know...

892
01:09:00,958 --> 01:09:03,119
...what you could do with a tree.

893
01:09:03,293 --> 01:09:06,558
- Would you like me to introduce you to one?
- No, I've met one.

894
01:09:06,730 --> 01:09:10,564
Hey, Andy. We're shoving off.
Come on.

895
01:09:11,435 --> 01:09:15,895
- You better go. You'll miss your train.
- You seem to know the schedule.

896
01:09:16,073 --> 01:09:18,633
Well, nice try, Andy.
No harm done, huh?

897
01:09:18,809 --> 01:09:20,504
No harm done.

898
01:09:20,677 --> 01:09:22,770
Nice knowing you, Pat.

899
01:09:22,946 --> 01:09:25,813
Coffee's cheaper than beer.
I'll make another try next liberty.

900
01:09:25,983 --> 01:09:28,144
It won't do you any good.

901
01:09:34,057 --> 01:09:36,048
Let's go. Come on.

902
01:09:43,867 --> 01:09:45,732
You guys get him back to camp.

903
01:09:45,903 --> 01:09:49,669
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll tell you about it later.

904
01:10:04,321 --> 01:10:06,812
- Hey, slow down.
- Softy!

905
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:08,617
Andy, I had a wonderful time.

906
01:10:08,792 --> 01:10:12,250
I haven't been to the cinema in weeks.
We'll do it again soon.

907
01:10:12,429 --> 01:10:16,866
- Mind if I come up for a cup of coffee?
- It's awfully late.

908
01:10:17,401 --> 01:10:19,426
Andy! Please don't ruin it.

909
01:10:19,603 --> 01:10:22,197
- Come on, cut the act.
- I beg your pardon?

910
01:10:22,372 --> 01:10:24,499
We've been sparring around
long enough.

911
01:10:24,675 --> 01:10:26,836
- I think you'd better go.
- Really?

912
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:29,103
What do you take me for?

913
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:32,874
- You're no different than any other woman.
- Please go.

914
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:34,984
You're putting on a good show, Pat.

915
01:10:35,152 --> 01:10:37,484
What have you been doing
with the Marines in town?

916
01:10:37,654 --> 01:10:41,681
Pining your heart out for your husband
while he's sweating it away in Africa?

917
01:10:41,859 --> 01:10:43,383
I know you're married.

918
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,222
My husband was killed in El Alamein.

919
01:11:08,151 --> 01:11:10,085
Topeka white.

920
01:11:10,254 --> 01:11:12,586
Fox Company? Yes, sir.

921
01:11:21,031 --> 01:11:24,000
- Who's Pat Rogers?
- What?

922
01:11:24,468 --> 01:11:26,629
I read code, you know.

923
01:11:27,638 --> 01:11:31,699
Danny, I want to ask you something.
You ever apologize to anyone?

924
01:11:32,309 --> 01:11:34,607
What kind of a stupid question is that?

925
01:11:34,778 --> 01:11:36,837
What I mean to say is...

926
01:11:37,014 --> 01:11:41,610
...you do something you're real sorry for,
and go and say you're real sorry.

927
01:11:41,785 --> 01:11:43,753
You know what I mean?

928
01:11:45,756 --> 01:11:48,520
You ever apologize to a broad?

929
01:11:48,692 --> 01:11:51,718
Sure, lots of times. Why?

930
01:11:51,895 --> 01:11:55,695
Nothing. Nothing, I just wondered.

931
01:11:56,033 --> 01:11:58,524
I'm just wondering.

932
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:07,233
- Good night.
- Good night.

933
01:12:10,013 --> 01:12:13,244
- I'm warning you, keep away from me.
- I'd like to talk to you.

934
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:16,318
I don't want anything to do with you.
Leave me alone.

935
01:12:16,486 --> 01:12:20,650
I came here to say something to you,
and I'd like to say it. I want you to listen.

936
01:12:21,425 --> 01:12:23,222
Well, make it quick.

937
01:12:23,393 --> 01:12:29,229
Pat, I never apologized to anyone
for anything as long as I've lived.

938
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:32,960
I've never said I'm sorry for anything.

939
01:12:33,503 --> 01:12:36,529
But I'm saying I'm sorry to you.

940
01:12:37,407 --> 01:12:39,375
I feel real bad.

941
01:12:39,543 --> 01:12:42,273
And I couldn't rest easy.

942
01:12:42,646 --> 01:12:47,276
I'm very, very sorry, Pat.
That's all I wanted to say.

943
01:12:48,986 --> 01:12:53,446
Well, that was nice, Andy.
We all make mistakes, you know.

944
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:58,693
I don't expect you'd care
to go out with me again.

945
01:12:58,862 --> 01:13:01,296
I don't blame you.

946
01:13:02,332 --> 01:13:04,960
I won't bother you anymore.

947
01:13:09,373 --> 01:13:10,533
Andy...?

948
01:13:13,477 --> 01:13:16,776
There's a good film at the Majestic.

949
01:13:36,867 --> 01:13:38,334
Talk about your iron men.

950
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:42,871
These kids are tougher, they're a new metal.
We ought to call it Huxley's Harlots.

951
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,907
I think they'll be able to take care
of themselves now.

952
01:13:46,076 --> 01:13:48,340
Excuse me, sir.

953
01:13:48,512 --> 01:13:50,742
Request permission to dismiss the troops.

954
01:13:50,914 --> 01:13:53,678
- What's your rush?
- Liberty train leaves in 30 minutes.

955
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:57,047
You gonna go with the kids
or stay in camp with us old men?

956
01:13:57,220 --> 01:14:01,213
I think I'll go with the kids.
Maybe I can scare up an old woman.

957
01:14:01,391 --> 01:14:04,189
All right, turn them loose.

958
01:14:05,796 --> 01:14:07,730
Dismissed!

959
01:14:28,752 --> 01:14:32,017
Marion, there's that book you lent me.

960
01:14:32,189 --> 01:14:33,747
I couldn't go it.

961
01:14:33,924 --> 01:14:37,690
Hamlet reminds me of
an uncle of mine in Dayton...

962
01:14:37,861 --> 01:14:40,193
You know.

963
01:14:40,797 --> 01:14:42,924
Is that a letter from home?

964
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,125
No, it's from Rae.

965
01:14:45,302 --> 01:14:49,705
The girl on the ferryboat?
I didn't know you two were writing.

966
01:14:50,874 --> 01:14:52,364
I haven't.

967
01:14:52,542 --> 01:14:55,636
She has ever since we left the States.

968
01:14:56,213 --> 01:15:00,081
Almost like I'm the guy
that really counts.

969
01:15:00,584 --> 01:15:02,415
She even left San Diego.

970
01:15:02,586 --> 01:15:06,545
She's a secretary in a defense plant
up near San Francisco now.

971
01:15:06,857 --> 01:15:10,918
Mac, you've kicked around a long time.

972
01:15:11,094 --> 01:15:14,029
What would you do in my shoes?

973
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:21,128
I don't know, Marion. You're the only guy
that can answer that.

974
01:15:21,705 --> 01:15:24,538
I've seen a lot of funny things happen
on this lash-up.

975
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:27,233
I've seen girls like Rae...

976
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:31,312
And I know Marines that took a chance
on them and married them.

977
01:15:31,982 --> 01:15:34,951
Most of the time it worked out okay.

978
01:15:36,786 --> 01:15:39,584
They're a funny breed, kid.

979
01:15:39,756 --> 01:15:42,247
If they find the right man...

980
01:15:42,425 --> 01:15:45,394
...they can give him the love
and the understanding...

981
01:15:45,562 --> 01:15:48,759
...that all of us want
but few of us get.

982
01:15:49,833 --> 01:15:51,858
But the guy has to be a big man.

983
01:15:53,703 --> 01:15:58,731
He's gotta erase an awful lot
of ugly pictures from his mind.

984
01:16:07,317 --> 01:16:10,445
Gomez, come here.
Where'd you get them ribbons?

985
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:15,182
- Army-Navy store.
- Take them off before you get locked up.

986
01:16:16,793 --> 01:16:19,125
Strike me, look at the medals
on the bloke.

987
01:16:19,296 --> 01:16:21,560
He must have been everywhere,
eh, Marine?

988
01:16:21,731 --> 01:16:23,756
This boy's been around, buddy.

989
01:16:23,934 --> 01:16:25,196
You see this one here?

990
01:16:25,368 --> 01:16:28,963
Silver Star. Won it for gallantry
on Guadalcanal.

991
01:16:29,139 --> 01:16:32,074
I'll never forget that day
as long as I live.

992
01:16:32,242 --> 01:16:34,301
Me and my boys were on this patrol...

993
01:16:34,477 --> 01:16:37,275
...over the Kokumbona River
near Tassafaronga Point.

994
01:16:37,447 --> 01:16:41,042
And what happens? I get lost
from the rest of the men.

995
01:16:41,218 --> 01:16:43,709
So I come to this clearing.
It's blazing hot...

996
01:16:43,887 --> 01:16:47,084
...120 in the shade,
sweat gushing off me...

997
01:16:47,257 --> 01:16:50,317
...when all of a sudden, boom!
Everything hit the fan.

998
01:16:50,493 --> 01:16:52,927
They must have thought I was a general.

999
01:16:53,096 --> 01:16:55,223
Japs popped up from everywhere.

1000
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,166
I peer over to my left,
and what do I see?

1001
01:16:59,336 --> 01:17:00,735
- What was it?
- What was it?

1002
01:17:00,904 --> 01:17:03,771
A Jap machine gun
looking right down my throat.

1003
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:06,670
- Blimey! What do you do?
- So I look for a fast exit.

1004
01:17:06,843 --> 01:17:09,334
But in back of me, three Japs with rifles.

1005
01:17:09,512 --> 01:17:11,810
Gracious goodness!
Go on! Go on!

1006
01:17:11,982 --> 01:17:15,349
And to top it off,
a Jap sniper sat in a treetop.

1007
01:17:15,518 --> 01:17:18,316
- Makes me shudder to think of it.
- What happened?

1008
01:17:18,488 --> 01:17:19,955
So I say to myself, "Joe...

1009
01:17:20,123 --> 01:17:23,581
...a hundred broads from Chicago
to St. Louis will be grieving today."

1010
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,127
There was nothing for me to do
but to lower my head and charge!

1011
01:17:27,631 --> 01:17:32,762
- Out with it! What happened?
- What happened? I got killed!

1012
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:38,630
I've been had.

1013
01:17:55,358 --> 01:17:58,691
- Well, I'll see you, kid.
- Mac?

1014
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:02,259
Thanks.

1015
01:18:07,837 --> 01:18:12,638
<i>Dear Rae, it was good</i>
<i>to hear from you again...</i>

1016
01:18:14,511 --> 01:18:17,378
<i>On Thanksgiving, the whole outfit</i>
<i>got three-day passes...</i>

1017
01:18:17,547 --> 01:18:21,313
<i>... and we headed for Wellington.</i>
<i>All except Andy. He disappeared.</i>

1018
01:18:21,484 --> 01:18:27,184
<i>We found out later that Pat had invited</i>
<i>him to her father's farm outside Masterton.</i>

1019
01:18:27,357 --> 01:18:30,485
Well, now, has my daughter
shown you all of the farm?

1020
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:34,061
Oh, yes, and I never knew
there could be a place like this.

1021
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:37,028
Come with me. I've got something
I want to show you.

1022
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:40,192
- Do you want to come along?
- I'll help Mama with dinner.

1023
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:42,065
Come on, Hank.

1024
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,437
What do you think of him, Mother?

1025
01:18:45,608 --> 01:18:48,008
Why, he's built like a bull.

1026
01:18:48,178 --> 01:18:51,978
- What kind of a soldier is he?
- He's not a soldier, he's a Marine.

1027
01:18:52,148 --> 01:18:55,015
A Marine? Oh, yes,
they call them roughnecks.

1028
01:18:55,185 --> 01:18:57,346
No, no, leathernecks.

1029
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:01,183
You'd need a horse's collar
to get around him.

1030
01:19:05,228 --> 01:19:08,061
Patty is touchy about
what I'm going to show you...

1031
01:19:08,231 --> 01:19:11,758
...but she loves this land
as all of us Rogers do. That I know.

1032
01:19:11,935 --> 01:19:15,769
Running off to Wellington
proved nothing to the contrary.

1033
01:19:15,939 --> 01:19:18,999
When the wire came about
her husband, she just left us...

1034
01:19:19,175 --> 01:19:21,302
...just couldn't get adjusted to herself.

1035
01:19:21,478 --> 01:19:26,142
Then when her brother Timmy was killed,
she didn't seem to want to ever return.

1036
01:19:26,316 --> 01:19:28,682
This land was bought for Timmy.

1037
01:19:28,852 --> 01:19:33,516
I suppose the land
belongs to Patty now.

1038
01:19:34,657 --> 01:19:37,490
My son planted that ax
before he went away.

1039
01:19:37,660 --> 01:19:41,460
He said he'd return one day
and clear this land.

1040
01:19:46,403 --> 01:19:49,429
I'm afraid the ax is frozen, Andy.

1041
01:20:13,496 --> 01:20:17,227
You handle that ax
just like my son Timmy.

1042
01:20:26,242 --> 01:20:29,211
As I was saying, Andy,
life here is simple.

1043
01:20:29,379 --> 01:20:30,869
Not much like your America.

1044
01:20:31,047 --> 01:20:33,811
A good wife, a good pipe,
a good dog...

1045
01:20:33,983 --> 01:20:36,747
...and a piece of land.
It's the only way to live.

1046
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:40,048
I hope you don't mind
the whole clan busting in tonight...

1047
01:20:40,223 --> 01:20:42,657
...but we haven't seen Patty
in a long time...

1048
01:20:42,826 --> 01:20:45,522
...and we need cause
to gather now and then.

1049
01:20:45,695 --> 01:20:48,255
They were all wonderful.
I hope they liked me.

1050
01:20:48,431 --> 01:20:50,922
Yank, they loved you.

1051
01:20:51,201 --> 01:20:53,465
It's not a happy lot for us, Andy.

1052
01:20:53,636 --> 01:20:56,104
So many of our boys gone.

1053
01:20:58,908 --> 01:21:00,773
Come along, old girl.

1054
01:21:00,944 --> 01:21:05,472
Let's turn in and give the young folks
a chance before the log dies out.

1055
01:21:05,648 --> 01:21:07,616
- Good night.
- Good night.

1056
01:21:18,228 --> 01:21:22,688
Pat, we're leaving New Zealand soon,
and I want you to know one thing.

1057
01:21:22,866 --> 01:21:27,269
I'm glad I came here,
and I'm glad I found you.

1058
01:21:28,004 --> 01:21:31,667
You don't know how fouled up
I am inside me.

1059
01:21:32,141 --> 01:21:35,599
It's the kind of a thing
a guy can't shake overnight.

1060
01:21:36,913 --> 01:21:41,850
The only women I ever knew
were in the halls of the lumber towns.

1061
01:21:43,586 --> 01:21:46,020
Maybe it's a good thing
about us leaving.

1062
01:21:46,189 --> 01:21:49,283
Maybe I can get myself squared away.

1063
01:21:50,126 --> 01:21:54,893
I know how scared you are over losing
your husband and your brother.

1064
01:21:57,333 --> 01:22:00,131
Do you suppose you'll
ever come back to New Zealand?

1065
01:22:00,303 --> 01:22:03,500
You can never tell about the Marines.
Here today, gone tomorrow.

1066
01:22:03,673 --> 01:22:05,538
Andy, stop.

1067
01:22:05,708 --> 01:22:08,438
We both know
you'll never come back.

1068
01:22:08,611 --> 01:22:11,136
Oh, this rotten war.

1069
01:22:11,314 --> 01:22:16,251
Look, I know we're just friends,
but would you write me?

1070
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:20,548
I never get letters like the other guys.

1071
01:22:20,723 --> 01:22:22,588
Would you write me?

1072
01:22:22,759 --> 01:22:24,818
I mean, nothing to tie you down.

1073
01:22:24,994 --> 01:22:29,988
Just stuff about the farm
and your family, things like that.

1074
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:31,793
Would you?

1075
01:22:32,402 --> 01:22:33,994
I'll write to you.

1076
01:22:36,539 --> 01:22:39,997
Pat, I never knew there could be
a place like this...

1077
01:22:40,176 --> 01:22:44,169
...or people so nice. Like your family.

1078
01:22:49,586 --> 01:22:51,645
Honey, could I...?

1079
01:23:05,001 --> 01:23:07,799
No, Andy, no.

1080
01:23:07,971 --> 01:23:12,067
We mustn't. We mustn't.

1081
01:23:12,842 --> 01:23:15,003
Don't be angry with me, Andy.

1082
01:23:15,178 --> 01:23:19,410
I'm not angry, Pat.
I understand, honey.

1083
01:23:19,849 --> 01:23:22,409
- Good night.
- Good night.

1084
01:24:21,544 --> 01:24:23,239
<i>Time had run out.</i>

1085
01:24:23,413 --> 01:24:28,441
<i>Christmas Eve 1942 services were held</i>
<i>in a warehouse on the Wellington docks.</i>

1086
01:25:16,332 --> 01:25:20,029
<i>Afterwards we boarded the transports</i>
<i>known as the Unholy Four...</i>

1087
01:25:20,203 --> 01:25:22,831
<i>... and steamed from Wellington Bay</i>
<i>full of fight...</i>

1088
01:25:23,005 --> 01:25:26,964
<i>... and confident that we</i>
<i>would soon be storming a beachhead.</i>

1089
01:25:36,018 --> 01:25:38,851
<i>A week later we dropped anchor</i>
<i>in Skylark Channel...</i>

1090
01:25:39,021 --> 01:25:41,546
<i>... off an island known as Guadalcanal.</i>

1091
01:25:41,724 --> 01:25:43,715
<i>And then we got the word.</i>

1092
01:25:43,893 --> 01:25:47,124
<i>There would be no beachhead here</i>
<i>for Huxley's battalion.</i>

1093
01:25:47,296 --> 01:25:50,561
<i>Our assignment:</i>
<i>A dirty mop-up campaign.</i>

1094
01:25:50,733 --> 01:25:53,031
<i>As Marines, we took it</i>
<i>like any other order...</i>

1095
01:25:53,202 --> 01:25:57,036
<i>... but it was a blow</i>
<i>to the pride of Huxley's Harlots.</i>

1096
01:26:08,017 --> 01:26:11,544
<i>Weary Marines of the 1 st Division,</i>
<i>after five months fighting...</i>

1097
01:26:11,721 --> 01:26:15,054
<i>... stood by on the beach</i>
<i>to be relieved.</i>

1098
01:26:34,243 --> 01:26:37,770
- Say, what town is this, cousin?
- Guadalcanal, buster.

1099
01:26:37,947 --> 01:26:40,677
I didn't catch the name
of your fine-looking outfit.

1100
01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:42,977
The fighting 6th Marines.

1101
01:26:43,152 --> 01:26:45,746
Well, well, well.

1102
01:26:45,922 --> 01:26:48,413
Hey, boys! Strike up the band!

1103
01:26:48,591 --> 01:26:52,254
Huxley's Hookers finally got here!

1104
01:26:53,496 --> 01:26:56,090
Sarge, where's the nearest gin mill?

1105
01:26:56,265 --> 01:27:02,135
What do you guys think this is?! Fall in
on the double! Column of three! Snap it up!

1106
01:27:54,557 --> 01:27:57,025
- Get off the road!
- Get off the road!

1107
01:28:09,338 --> 01:28:11,397
We've had some casualties, sir.

1108
01:28:11,574 --> 01:28:14,134
Evacuate them to the beach.

1109
01:28:16,812 --> 01:28:20,805
- Call them in, Mac.
- On the road! Let's go!

1110
01:28:21,751 --> 01:28:25,209
<i>There were only a few actual skirmishes</i>
<i>with the elusive Japanese.</i>

1111
01:28:25,688 --> 01:28:27,815
<i>Our main enemy became the jungle.</i>

1112
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:31,983
<i>The mosquitoes and the land crabs.</i>
<i>Malaria. Yellow jaundice and fungus.</i>

1113
01:28:32,161 --> 01:28:35,289
<i>The blistering sun</i>
<i>and the tropical downpours.</i>

1114
01:28:35,464 --> 01:28:39,366
<i>For a month we played cat and mouse</i>
<i>with the remnants of the Japanese force.</i>

1115
01:28:39,535 --> 01:28:42,470
<i>And then at last we cornered them</i>
<i>on an end of the island...</i>

1116
01:28:42,638 --> 01:28:46,506
<i>... and brought an end to organized</i>
<i>resistance on Guadalcanal.</i>

1117
01:28:46,676 --> 01:28:49,406
<i>We boarded ship again</i>
<i>and sailed for Wellington.</i>

1118
01:28:49,578 --> 01:28:53,844
<i>We were a dog-tired crew, but there</i>
<i>hadn't been much of a fight to talk about.</i>

1119
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:57,110
<i>Perhaps the greatest wound of all</i>
<i>had been to our pride.</i>

1120
01:28:57,586 --> 01:28:59,850
<i>As New Zealand appeared</i>
<i>on the horizon...</i>

1121
01:29:00,022 --> 01:29:02,889
<i>... we eagerly anticipated</i>
<i>renewing old friendships.</i>

1122
01:29:03,059 --> 01:29:07,086
<i>And for some,</i>
<i>seeing loved ones again.</i>

1123
01:29:13,903 --> 01:29:15,962
Hello, Pat.

1124
01:29:16,138 --> 01:29:18,766
I went down to the canteen,
but you weren't there.

1125
01:29:18,941 --> 01:29:21,603
Well, don't stand there,
come on in.

1126
01:29:21,777 --> 01:29:25,213
We knew you were back, but it
was so difficult to get information...

1127
01:29:25,381 --> 01:29:27,645
...I didn't know when to expect you.

1128
01:29:27,817 --> 01:29:30,479
Andy, do sit down.
I have some tea ready.

1129
01:29:30,653 --> 01:29:35,147
We no sooner than dumped our gear
than they gave us 10 days leave.

1130
01:29:35,424 --> 01:29:38,951
I got myself a hotel room
here in Wellington.

1131
01:29:44,734 --> 01:29:46,599
You don't look well.

1132
01:29:46,769 --> 01:29:49,237
It's the heat. I'm all right.

1133
01:29:49,405 --> 01:29:52,101
The battalion lost
a couple of dozen guys.

1134
01:29:52,274 --> 01:29:54,834
Remember Ski? He got it.

1135
01:29:55,011 --> 01:29:58,276
I guess he didn't want
to live anyhow, though.

1136
01:29:58,447 --> 01:30:00,745
A lot of the guys
are sick and wounded.

1137
01:30:00,916 --> 01:30:03,749
We'll be okay in a couple of weeks,
though.

1138
01:30:05,621 --> 01:30:07,885
I shouldn't have filled it so full.

1139
01:30:08,057 --> 01:30:11,117
I'm all right, just a little shaky.

1140
01:30:11,293 --> 01:30:15,354
Guadalcanal must have been frightful.
I shan't ask you about it.

1141
01:30:15,531 --> 01:30:18,796
Well, I got me a leave.

1142
01:30:18,968 --> 01:30:22,927
Three months furlough.
I mean three months back pay.

1143
01:30:23,105 --> 01:30:25,573
I think I'll take me in
some of the country.

1144
01:30:25,741 --> 01:30:28,403
You look as though you could do
with some rest.

1145
01:30:28,577 --> 01:30:32,673
- Why don't you go to the farm?
- I don't want to go to the farm.

1146
01:30:36,285 --> 01:30:40,051
- I feel so hot.
- Andy...

1147
01:30:41,924 --> 01:30:44,324
I think you might have malaria, Andy.

1148
01:30:44,493 --> 01:30:46,757
No, I'd know malaria.

1149
01:30:46,929 --> 01:30:48,624
You're burning up.

1150
01:30:48,798 --> 01:30:52,256
- Let me get you to a hospital.
- I'm not going to a hospital.

1151
01:30:52,435 --> 01:30:54,062
Don't be so obstinate.

1152
01:30:54,236 --> 01:30:56,864
I'm not gonna spend my furlough
in a hospital.

1153
01:30:57,039 --> 01:31:00,531
Call me a cab, I'll go to my hotel
and sweat it out.

1154
01:31:00,709 --> 01:31:04,338
I'll call you in a couple of days.
I'll be all right.

1155
01:31:04,513 --> 01:31:07,949
Please let me take you
to a hospital.

1156
01:31:09,085 --> 01:31:11,076
I'm freezing, honey.

1157
01:31:11,253 --> 01:31:13,949
I'm getting those chills again.

1158
01:31:15,758 --> 01:31:20,127
I'm freezing.
Get me a blanket.

1159
01:31:22,865 --> 01:31:25,561
Ski! Ski!

1160
01:31:25,734 --> 01:31:28,464
Run for it! Ski!

1161
01:31:28,637 --> 01:31:32,801
Run for it, Ski! Run for it.

1162
01:31:33,676 --> 01:31:35,576
Run for it, Ski!

1163
01:31:36,145 --> 01:31:38,943
<i>Run for it, Ski!</i>

1164
01:31:46,655 --> 01:31:51,592
<i>Run for it! Ski! Run for it!</i>
<i>Run for it, Ski!</i>

1165
01:31:54,897 --> 01:31:59,459
<i>Ski, Ski! Run, run!</i>

1166
01:32:24,693 --> 01:32:26,388
How long have I been here?

1167
01:32:26,562 --> 01:32:28,530
Three days.

1168
01:32:29,565 --> 01:32:31,533
I'm sorry, honey.

1169
01:32:32,201 --> 01:32:35,932
I must say, you gave me
a bit of a fright.

1170
01:32:36,105 --> 01:32:38,539
You look all beat.
Did you get any sleep?

1171
01:32:38,707 --> 01:32:41,369
I caught a wink or two.

1172
01:32:41,944 --> 01:32:44,606
You've been through hell.

1173
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:51,518
Nobody's ever done anything
like this for me before.

1174
01:32:57,693 --> 01:33:01,060
Andy, I was so frightened.

1175
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:04,224
I'm not keeping any more lamps
in the window...

1176
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:07,563
...or waiting for any more
ships in the bay.

1177
01:33:07,736 --> 01:33:11,103
This war has done me in.

1178
01:33:11,273 --> 01:33:15,232
I want you while you're here.
That's all that matters, that's all.

1179
01:33:15,411 --> 01:33:18,778
It's not right for you to talk like that.

1180
01:33:18,948 --> 01:33:23,544
Andy, you're here and you're safe.
I can have you for a little while.

1181
01:33:23,719 --> 01:33:29,123
That's all that matters to me,
is this day and this minute.

1182
01:33:29,525 --> 01:33:35,020
I'm tired, Andy.
I'm tired of living in fear.

1183
01:33:52,514 --> 01:33:54,482
Congratulations.

1184
01:33:56,085 --> 01:33:58,053
I can thank my boys for these.

1185
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:00,245
One sour note.

1186
01:34:00,422 --> 01:34:04,449
Mac's boys are acting up again.
More limericks.

1187
01:34:07,997 --> 01:34:11,262
<i>- Fox Company.</i>
- Get Mac up here, please.

1188
01:34:14,403 --> 01:34:16,428
What are you trying to hide?

1189
01:34:16,605 --> 01:34:20,837
- We decided we wouldn't let you see this.
- Let's have it.

1190
01:34:22,044 --> 01:34:25,138
"Report on the 8th Marines'
Hike to Foxton."

1191
01:34:25,314 --> 01:34:26,941
Let's see, now.

1192
01:34:27,116 --> 01:34:31,177
"Sixty miles to Foxton.
Concrete highway.

1193
01:34:31,353 --> 01:34:34,379
Bivouac in the field.
Trucks drove them back to camp.

1194
01:34:34,556 --> 01:34:37,150
Twenty hours marching time."

1195
01:34:37,326 --> 01:34:41,990
Great Scott, that's no record. Our battalion
can cut hours off of that time.

1196
01:34:42,164 --> 01:34:43,631
I knew you'd say that.

1197
01:34:43,799 --> 01:34:48,065
Get this to Message Center
to inform all company commanders.

1198
01:34:48,237 --> 01:34:50,603
The 1 st Battalion's already
scheduled a hike...

1199
01:34:50,773 --> 01:34:55,039
...but I think it's a bit soon for us
to attempt a 60-mile hike with full packs.

1200
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:57,770
If you ask me,
it's just what the doctor ordered.

1201
01:34:57,946 --> 01:35:01,404
We'll crack the record.
And as far as the 1 st Battalion goes...

1202
01:35:01,583 --> 01:35:05,485
...they haven't seen the day we couldn't
hike them into the ground. Come in.

1203
01:35:05,654 --> 01:35:10,091
Get with Operations on that.
They can start typing it up.

1204
01:35:12,528 --> 01:35:15,793
I understand those boys of yours
have been getting poetic again.

1205
01:35:15,964 --> 01:35:18,933
And just because I gave permission
to build a clubhouse...

1206
01:35:19,101 --> 01:35:21,934
...I didn't okay your stealing
every loose board in camp.

1207
01:35:22,104 --> 01:35:25,471
I guess they're just red-blooded
American boys, colonel.

1208
01:35:26,408 --> 01:35:29,969
How did you find out I made
lieutenant colonel? I just heard myself.

1209
01:35:30,145 --> 01:35:33,410
Communicator's job
is to communicate, sir.

1210
01:35:35,284 --> 01:35:38,253
Well, you tell those red-blooded
American boys of yours...

1211
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:41,583
...they better enjoy that dance
tonight, because after that...

1212
01:35:41,757 --> 01:35:44,385
We know all about that too, sir.

1213
01:35:44,993 --> 01:35:48,019
- You know all about what?
- The 60-mile hike to Foxton.

1214
01:35:48,197 --> 01:35:50,961
My outfit handles Message Center too.

1215
01:35:53,001 --> 01:35:55,936
- Get out of here.
- Yes, sir.

1216
01:36:08,484 --> 01:36:10,782
Colonel Huxley.

1217
01:36:10,953 --> 01:36:15,049
Your Honor, I'd like to have you meet
some of the ladies we're dancing with.

1218
01:36:15,224 --> 01:36:16,714
This is...

1219
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:22,729
I've forgotten their names, but make
yourself at home. I'll get us some beer.

1220
01:36:31,206 --> 01:36:32,867
Hello, Pedro.

1221
01:36:33,041 --> 01:36:36,875
Incidentally, congratulations
on your Silver Star.

1222
01:36:37,045 --> 01:36:39,843
<i>Gracias,</i> my storywriting friend.

1223
01:36:41,049 --> 01:36:44,382
Like I was saying, we've got
the best sergeant, the best outfit...

1224
01:36:44,553 --> 01:36:47,989
...and the best colonel in the Marine Corps.
- Excuse me, colonel.

1225
01:36:48,157 --> 01:36:50,648
Have you seen the view
from the terrace, sir?

1226
01:36:50,826 --> 01:36:53,192
I'd like to have you see it, sir.

1227
01:36:54,663 --> 01:36:56,995
If you'll excuse me.

1228
01:36:59,034 --> 01:37:03,095
- What is this, Mac?
- The view's best from over here, sir.

1229
01:37:06,308 --> 01:37:10,074
Compliments of those
red-blooded American boys of yours, sir.

1230
01:37:10,612 --> 01:37:13,638
- A little fuel for Foxton.
- Yes, sir.

1231
01:37:13,816 --> 01:37:16,182
Sir! Colonel Huxley!

1232
01:37:16,351 --> 01:37:20,219
Colonel Huxley, Mrs. Rogers.
Sergeant Mac, Mrs. Rogers.

1233
01:37:20,389 --> 01:37:25,122
Beautiful night, isn't it?
Nice dance we're having.

1234
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:31,090
Mac, Andy, come on! These girls want to
hear our marching song! Let's go.

1235
01:37:31,266 --> 01:37:33,962
Excuse me, sir.
Excuse me, Pat.

1236
01:37:38,207 --> 01:37:40,505
So you're Andy's girl.

1237
01:37:42,044 --> 01:37:44,638
I've heard an awful lot about you.

1238
01:37:44,813 --> 01:37:49,773
I'll never know how that big lumberjack
ever ran into such a wonderful streak of luck.

1239
01:37:49,952 --> 01:37:51,510
And you're High Pockets.

1240
01:37:53,388 --> 01:37:56,949
- Oh, excuse me, Colonel Huxley.
- That's all right.

1241
01:37:57,125 --> 01:38:00,583
I don't mind High Pockets as long
as they don't call me the old man.

1242
01:38:00,762 --> 01:38:03,663
I should be very angry
if they called you the old man.

1243
01:38:03,832 --> 01:38:06,801
As a matter of fact,
your men adore you.

1244
01:38:06,969 --> 01:38:12,236
Well, I don't think I'd go quite that far,
Mrs. Rogers, but thank you.

1245
01:38:12,407 --> 01:38:14,602
- My name is Pat.
- Thank you, Pat.

1246
01:38:14,776 --> 01:38:18,143
No, don't go in just yet. Please.

1247
01:38:18,313 --> 01:38:21,441
I don't get an opportunity like this
very often...

1248
01:38:21,617 --> 01:38:25,018
...to talk to such an attractive young lady.

1249
01:38:25,454 --> 01:38:29,584
Must be wretched having to keep yourself
isolated from your men.

1250
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:35,360
I see you have a knack
for reading people's minds.

1251
01:38:35,531 --> 01:38:37,795
You must be a very wise girl, Pat.

1252
01:38:38,433 --> 01:38:40,628
It's not hard to see a lonely person...

1253
01:38:40,802 --> 01:38:44,294
...even though he is surrounded
by 900 Marines.

1254
01:38:44,473 --> 01:38:48,000
I imagine you know what
it's like to be homesick.

1255
01:38:49,278 --> 01:38:52,645
I didn't realize it showed.

1256
01:38:52,814 --> 01:38:55,715
- Would you like to see...?
- Your children?

1257
01:38:55,884 --> 01:38:59,149
No, we have no children.
This is my wife.

1258
01:39:02,724 --> 01:39:04,919
She's lovely.

1259
01:39:05,093 --> 01:39:06,993
I know how you must miss her.

1260
01:39:07,162 --> 01:39:11,258
Jean has a lot in common
with you New Zealand girls.

1261
01:39:11,433 --> 01:39:13,560
This war has done that.

1262
01:39:13,735 --> 01:39:16,363
You're all soldiers' wives here.

1263
01:39:16,538 --> 01:39:21,908
It's funny, she could always
read my mind too.

1264
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:25,839
In a great many ways,
you remind me of my wife.

1265
01:39:30,519 --> 01:39:32,680
Well, I'm sorry, did...?

1266
01:39:32,854 --> 01:39:34,788
Did I say something wrong?

1267
01:39:34,957 --> 01:39:38,120
I'm not fit to remind you
of your wife, colonel.

1268
01:39:38,293 --> 01:39:40,557
I'm so ashamed.

1269
01:39:41,530 --> 01:39:44,397
I can't use the war as
an excuse anymore, I know that.

1270
01:39:44,566 --> 01:39:47,763
But this chance with Andy,
I thought it would mean happiness.

1271
01:39:47,936 --> 01:39:50,734
It was a straw, and I grabbed for it.

1272
01:39:51,006 --> 01:39:52,667
I see.

1273
01:39:52,841 --> 01:39:54,900
Well, I didn't...

1274
01:39:56,645 --> 01:40:00,809
You're not the only person in this world
who ever grabbed for a straw.

1275
01:40:00,983 --> 01:40:03,918
We all do it sometime in our lives.

1276
01:40:04,086 --> 01:40:06,748
But in our mind, in our conscience...

1277
01:40:06,922 --> 01:40:12,326
...we have to find out for ourselves
what we can live with and what we can't.

1278
01:40:12,494 --> 01:40:15,986
You're the only one who can
make that decision.

1279
01:40:33,715 --> 01:40:36,013
Nice dance, wasn't it, honey?

1280
01:40:36,184 --> 01:40:39,620
I won't be able to see you for a few days.
We're hiking to Foxton.

1281
01:40:39,788 --> 01:40:43,781
- We've got something to talk about.
- It'll keep till morning. I'm tired.

1282
01:40:43,959 --> 01:40:46,154
It won't keep, Andy.

1283
01:40:46,328 --> 01:40:49,195
I'm calling it off between us.

1284
01:40:49,464 --> 01:40:52,297
What'd you say?
I don't think I get you.

1285
01:40:52,968 --> 01:40:55,027
It's all over, Andy.

1286
01:40:55,203 --> 01:40:57,831
Honey, what are you talking about?
Are you nuts?

1287
01:40:58,006 --> 01:40:59,667
What have I done?

1288
01:40:59,841 --> 01:41:04,244
- I don't want a scene. Please.
- Pat, you're talking crazy.

1289
01:41:04,413 --> 01:41:06,540
I know what you may think of me.

1290
01:41:06,715 --> 01:41:09,775
I can't do anything about it,
it's too late now.

1291
01:41:09,951 --> 01:41:12,749
But I'm just not cut out
for this sort of thing.

1292
01:41:12,921 --> 01:41:15,890
I was miserably mistaken to think
I could live like this.

1293
01:41:16,058 --> 01:41:18,583
Whatever you may think is right...

1294
01:41:19,528 --> 01:41:22,088
It just doesn't matter anymore.

1295
01:41:22,264 --> 01:41:25,165
- I'm crazy about you!
- Andy, please...

1296
01:41:25,333 --> 01:41:29,770
I don't want a showdown. I'm not asking
anything from you, I just want you to go.

1297
01:41:29,938 --> 01:41:32,634
I can't stay in this country
and not be able to see you.

1298
01:41:32,808 --> 01:41:34,105
Don't shout!

1299
01:41:34,376 --> 01:41:36,742
I know this is sudden.
You're shocked and hurt.

1300
01:41:36,912 --> 01:41:41,315
- You're liable to say something you'll regret.
- I'm regretting nothing. I love you!

1301
01:41:41,483 --> 01:41:44,316
Don't say that,
you know you don't mean it.

1302
01:41:44,486 --> 01:41:47,512
Honey, I could never leave you,
I love you.

1303
01:41:48,356 --> 01:41:51,223
I got an idea. Let's get married.

1304
01:41:51,393 --> 01:41:54,021
Let's get married
when I get back from Foxton.

1305
01:41:54,196 --> 01:41:58,428
I know how you feel about the war,
but us Swedes are tough. I know I'll make it.

1306
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:00,864
We've got to take a chance.

1307
01:42:01,036 --> 01:42:02,936
Oh, Andy...

1308
01:42:04,072 --> 01:42:06,302
Andy, I'm so frightened!

1309
01:42:06,475 --> 01:42:11,344
I'll see the chaplain. It's a lot of red tape,
but I'll get it squared away.

1310
01:42:11,513 --> 01:42:16,576
Pat, I ain't never been
so happy in my life.

1311
01:42:17,219 --> 01:42:20,586
- Andy.
- What, honey?

1312
01:42:21,990 --> 01:42:24,823
If we have a little boy...

1313
01:42:25,994 --> 01:42:29,794
...would you mind terribly
if we named him Timmy...

1314
01:42:29,965 --> 01:42:31,455
...after my brother?

1315
01:42:34,236 --> 01:42:37,228
Are we gonna have a baby?

1316
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,067
We're gonna have a baby?

1317
01:42:41,076 --> 01:42:44,068
- Yes, Andy.
- Why didn't you tell me, honey?

1318
01:42:44,246 --> 01:42:46,339
I didn't want to hold you that way.

1319
01:42:46,515 --> 01:42:48,710
You'd have let me go?

1320
01:42:48,884 --> 01:42:52,320
You'd have sent me away,
you'd have done that for me?

1321
01:42:52,487 --> 01:42:58,722
Andy, I've loved you a long, long time.
What other decision could I make?

1322
01:42:59,161 --> 01:43:04,463
At least I knew I had something
this war couldn't take away from me.

1323
01:43:12,808 --> 01:43:17,142
Hut, two, three, four.
Hut, two, three, four.

1324
01:43:17,312 --> 01:43:20,110
Column, right, huh!

1325
01:43:21,716 --> 01:43:24,480
- How far we going?
- About 60 miles.

1326
01:43:24,653 --> 01:43:29,090
- I wonder where we'll bed down tonight.
- Wherever it is, you'll be alone.

1327
01:43:52,180 --> 01:43:55,638
<i>From the moment we left the camp,</i>
<i>we knew High Pockets meant business.</i>

1328
01:43:55,817 --> 01:44:00,254
<i>The pace never slackened through</i>
<i>a torrent of rain and a long, black night.</i>

1329
01:44:04,793 --> 01:44:07,956
<i>The sun felt good the next morning,</i>
<i>but the rain had taken its toll.</i>

1330
01:44:08,129 --> 01:44:10,495
<i>Wet feet and hard dirt</i>
<i>aren't teammates.</i>

1331
01:44:10,665 --> 01:44:13,395
<i>There must have been 10,000 blisters</i>
<i>in the column.</i>

1332
01:44:51,072 --> 01:44:55,600
<i>In 17 hours' marching time, the column</i>
<i>stood on a hill overlooking Foxton.</i>

1333
01:44:55,777 --> 01:44:56,766
Hold up the column!

1334
01:44:56,945 --> 01:45:01,644
<i>And it would be a cold day in July</i>
<i>before anyone cracked this record.</i>

1335
01:45:04,252 --> 01:45:07,813
There's the 1 st Battalion.
Looks like they just got in.

1336
01:45:07,989 --> 01:45:10,480
Didn't they leave camp
the day before we did?

1337
01:45:11,559 --> 01:45:14,221
- That's right.
- We just radioed the 1 st Battalion.

1338
01:45:14,396 --> 01:45:16,421
We beat their time by five hours.

1339
01:45:16,598 --> 01:45:19,897
And it looks like we beat
the 8th Marines' record by three.

1340
01:45:20,068 --> 01:45:23,299
Their trucks are coming tomorrow
to take them back to McKay.

1341
01:45:23,471 --> 01:45:25,598
Don't you think maybe we rate priority?

1342
01:45:25,774 --> 01:45:30,609
Our boys should ride back first
after the job they turned in.

1343
01:45:34,249 --> 01:45:35,910
Company commanders,
take charge!

1344
01:45:36,084 --> 01:45:38,882
Meiskar, Clark, Kreb, out!
Hookens, over here.

1345
01:45:39,054 --> 01:45:42,751
- Gomez, set up there.
- Smoking lamp is lit!

1346
01:45:43,525 --> 01:45:47,621
Corporal Forrester requests permission
to speak to you.

1347
01:45:47,796 --> 01:45:49,661
All right.

1348
01:45:49,831 --> 01:45:51,355
What's on your mind?

1349
01:45:51,533 --> 01:45:54,627
I know this is out of line,
but we haven't got much time...

1350
01:45:54,803 --> 01:45:56,600
Get to the point.

1351
01:45:56,771 --> 01:45:59,604
Well, PFC Andy Hookens
is in bad shape.

1352
01:45:59,774 --> 01:46:03,039
His feet are all bloody,
and I think he's got a touch of the bug.

1353
01:46:03,211 --> 01:46:05,111
He refuses to turn in.

1354
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:08,113
Could you send him back
with the 1 st Battalion?

1355
01:46:08,583 --> 01:46:11,279
You're out of line.
That's for Sick Bay to decide.

1356
01:46:11,553 --> 01:46:15,114
- I don't grant special favors to any man.
- Colonel Huxley...

1357
01:46:15,290 --> 01:46:16,757
Just a minute, Mac.

1358
01:46:16,925 --> 01:46:20,088
You know this is out of order.
Let's have the real reason.

1359
01:46:20,261 --> 01:46:22,695
Hookens and Pat Rogers
want to get married.

1360
01:46:23,098 --> 01:46:26,363
The scuttlebutt has it we're shipping out
as soon as we get back.

1361
01:46:26,534 --> 01:46:30,698
If he waits for those trucks to come
back for us, he ain't gonna have time.

1362
01:46:30,872 --> 01:46:33,966
Not with all the red tape
they have to go through.

1363
01:46:34,242 --> 01:46:36,676
Request denied.

1364
01:46:45,053 --> 01:46:47,283
- Thank you, sir.
- Mac.

1365
01:46:47,889 --> 01:46:51,689
Tell Major Wellman to form up
the battalion. We're moving out.

1366
01:46:52,961 --> 01:46:54,656
Yes, sir.

1367
01:47:06,474 --> 01:47:07,839
Have you gone mad?

1368
01:47:08,009 --> 01:47:10,534
I've stood by through all
your torture sessions...

1369
01:47:10,712 --> 01:47:12,737
...but I'm putting my foot down.

1370
01:47:12,914 --> 01:47:15,678
Don't put it down too hard.
It's probably sore.

1371
01:47:15,850 --> 01:47:19,616
Why won't you wait for the trucks?
You can't hike these men back to McKay.

1372
01:47:19,788 --> 01:47:22,154
They've only had three hours' rest.

1373
01:47:22,323 --> 01:47:26,487
Twenty men dropped out coming up here.
You'll hospitalize the entire battalion.

1374
01:47:27,929 --> 01:47:31,456
So I'm just a wartime officer,
but I know where humanity ends.

1375
01:47:31,633 --> 01:47:35,160
I watched you hike these boys back
from Guadalcanal...

1376
01:47:35,336 --> 01:47:37,497
...because you wanted to prove
how tough you were.

1377
01:47:37,672 --> 01:47:41,631
I'm not only gonna hike them back,
but we're gonna break our own record.

1378
01:47:41,810 --> 01:47:46,076
What are you trying to prove? You haven't
got a drop of human blood in your veins.

1379
01:47:46,247 --> 01:47:49,341
Do you think that enemy
is gonna show us any humanity?

1380
01:47:49,517 --> 01:47:51,951
We're in a war, Wellman.

1381
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:54,350
I'll drive them, and I'll drive myself.

1382
01:47:54,522 --> 01:47:58,356
When we go into battle again, not one of my
boys will die because he's a straggler.

1383
01:47:58,526 --> 01:48:00,926
Not one's gonna die
because he's weak.

1384
01:48:01,096 --> 01:48:03,462
Get out of my outfit
if you can't take it.

1385
01:48:03,998 --> 01:48:07,024
I'll make it back if you will.

1386
01:48:08,403 --> 01:48:11,895
Company commander, get your men
on their feet. We're moving out.

1387
01:48:12,073 --> 01:48:15,668
- Pass the word to the other companies.
- Aye, aye, sir. On your feet!

1388
01:48:15,844 --> 01:48:18,369
- Saddle up!
- On your feet!

1389
01:48:43,671 --> 01:48:47,300
Boy, I could sure go
for a cold glass of beer.

1390
01:48:47,475 --> 01:48:48,999
Shut up!

1391
01:49:00,755 --> 01:49:02,222
Why don't we keep going?

1392
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:04,984
Every time I stop,
I get these shooting pains.

1393
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:08,596
At least I'm good and numb
while we're hiking.

1394
01:49:08,763 --> 01:49:11,698
I'm going to keep on my feet
as long as Huxley does.

1395
01:49:11,866 --> 01:49:15,529
Same here.
We're only one day from McKay.

1396
01:49:15,703 --> 01:49:17,364
Speak to me.

1397
01:49:17,939 --> 01:49:20,305
All right.
Let's hit the road!

1398
01:49:20,475 --> 01:49:22,409
On your feet!

1399
01:49:26,281 --> 01:49:27,873
Count up!

1400
01:49:31,252 --> 01:49:33,379
Come on, kid. On your feet.

1401
01:49:33,555 --> 01:49:36,490
You ain't gonna get married out here.

1402
01:49:42,230 --> 01:49:44,198
<i>Our feet were pounded</i>
<i>into numbness.</i>

1403
01:49:44,365 --> 01:49:46,299
<i>The packs cut deep</i>
<i>into our shoulders.</i>

1404
01:49:46,467 --> 01:49:48,594
<i>But the murderous cadence</i>
<i>never let up.</i>

1405
01:49:48,770 --> 01:49:52,570
<i>The stronger ones</i>
<i>kept the weaker ones going.</i>

1406
01:49:52,740 --> 01:49:54,435
Pass the word back.

1407
01:49:54,609 --> 01:49:56,702
We're picking up the pace.

1408
01:49:58,846 --> 01:50:01,974
All right! Pass the word back!
We're speeding up the pace!

1409
01:50:02,150 --> 01:50:07,213
- Keep it closed up back there!
- High Pockets has gone crazy.

1410
01:50:07,388 --> 01:50:09,288
Bet he drops before we do.

1411
01:50:09,457 --> 01:50:11,789
You laying any odds on that, cousin?

1412
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:16,420
<i>Then, as a man, the whole battalion</i>
<i>became obsessed with a single thought:</i>

1413
01:50:16,598 --> 01:50:22,264
<i>To keep marching, pushing Huxley</i>
<i>until he fell flat on his face.</i>

1414
01:50:30,645 --> 01:50:34,513
<i>Ten kilometers from Camp McKay.</i>
<i>It might as well have been 100.</i>

1415
01:50:34,682 --> 01:50:37,014
<i>We were whipped.</i>

1416
01:50:38,653 --> 01:50:40,848
If we hit that road again,
I'm dropping out.

1417
01:50:41,022 --> 01:50:43,217
That makes two of us.
How about you?

1418
01:50:43,391 --> 01:50:45,757
I honestly don't know.

1419
01:50:45,927 --> 01:50:49,192
I think I'll sit right here and wait
for them big buses.

1420
01:50:49,364 --> 01:50:52,595
I ain't blaming any man in this squad
for dropping out now.

1421
01:50:52,767 --> 01:50:56,931
But I'm getting back to McKay
if I gotta go on my hands and knees.

1422
01:50:57,972 --> 01:50:59,166
We're finished, Sam.

1423
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:03,868
If we try this last 10 kilometers,
we'll lose half the battalion.

1424
01:51:04,746 --> 01:51:07,112
I know what's held them up.

1425
01:51:07,282 --> 01:51:09,978
They'll hike because they're mad.

1426
01:51:10,151 --> 01:51:13,279
And what's more,
they won't quit because they're mad.

1427
01:51:13,454 --> 01:51:15,718
We'll make that last piece on our feet.

1428
01:51:15,890 --> 01:51:18,916
You're mistaken, we'll need a miracle.

1429
01:51:19,093 --> 01:51:21,755
We may have that too
in just about a minute.

1430
01:51:54,162 --> 01:51:58,098
Well, if you men want to sit
and cry with the 1 st Battalion tonight...

1431
01:51:58,266 --> 01:52:01,258
...l'll have them send back
those trucks for you.

1432
01:52:01,436 --> 01:52:04,667
A lot of people in this division
don't believe we can make it.

1433
01:52:04,839 --> 01:52:07,103
What do you think?

1434
01:52:12,347 --> 01:52:14,508
When we hit that camp gate...

1435
01:52:14,682 --> 01:52:17,708
...let's give them a look
at the best outfit in the Corps!

1436
01:52:17,885 --> 01:52:21,753
Left face!

1437
01:52:23,591 --> 01:52:26,583
Column left!
Hut!

1438
01:53:21,149 --> 01:53:22,810
Come in.

1439
01:53:22,984 --> 01:53:24,918
- Hello, Mac!
- Sir, how are you?

1440
01:53:25,086 --> 01:53:27,145
What are you doing,
spying for Father McHale?

1441
01:53:27,321 --> 01:53:29,346
No, sir, I leave that to G-2.

1442
01:53:29,524 --> 01:53:33,893
I want you to meet two men from my outfit,
Corporal Forrester and PFC Hookens.

1443
01:53:34,061 --> 01:53:38,191
- Hookens has got a little problem.
- That's what I'm here for. Sit down, boys.

1444
01:53:39,734 --> 01:53:41,258
What seems to be your problem?

1445
01:53:41,436 --> 01:53:44,701
Well, sir, that picture
on the bulletin board out there...

1446
01:53:44,872 --> 01:53:47,306
...it's a dead ringer for my girl.

1447
01:53:49,177 --> 01:53:51,145
Hookens, of course.

1448
01:53:51,312 --> 01:53:53,542
Colonel Huxley called me from Foxton.

1449
01:53:53,714 --> 01:53:57,081
He said you'd be around.
He also said that girl's too good for you.

1450
01:53:57,251 --> 01:54:00,914
- I won't argue that, sir.
- Looks like I've been blackmailed.

1451
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:04,888
The colonel said if I didn't get you two
hitched without this red tape...

1452
01:54:05,059 --> 01:54:07,289
...he'd take his battalion
to Father McHale.

1453
01:54:07,462 --> 01:54:10,659
Everything's been arranged.
Three-day passes for your squad.

1454
01:54:10,832 --> 01:54:14,029
Man in the loan office
said just sign there.

1455
01:54:14,202 --> 01:54:18,036
You've got orders from the colonel
to get to Wellington on the double.

1456
01:54:18,206 --> 01:54:20,037
- Yes, sir!
- Okay.

1457
01:54:20,208 --> 01:54:22,073
Thank you, sir.

1458
01:54:34,589 --> 01:54:37,683
- Blood brother.
- Thanks.

1459
01:54:41,496 --> 01:54:44,897
Ladies and gentlemen,
please wait a minute.

1460
01:54:45,066 --> 01:54:48,661
A Marine toast to Pat and Andy.

1461
01:54:51,172 --> 01:54:54,403
Come on, let's go!
Come on, boy!

1462
01:55:05,286 --> 01:55:07,880
<i>It was a wonderful wedding</i>
<i>and a wonderful party.</i>

1463
01:55:08,055 --> 01:55:10,785
<i>And a terrible headache</i>
<i>the next morning.</i>

1464
01:55:10,958 --> 01:55:15,361
<i>Two days later we were ordered</i>
<i>to break camp and board ship.</i>

1465
01:55:21,636 --> 01:55:23,331
Wait a minute.

1466
01:55:23,504 --> 01:55:25,904
- Mac wants you on a work detail.
- Take the detail.

1467
01:55:26,073 --> 01:55:28,598
Don't blow your top.
Who do you think you are?

1468
01:55:28,776 --> 01:55:33,736
This outfit's been knocking itself out for you,
giving up liberty so you could get ashore.

1469
01:55:33,915 --> 01:55:37,578
- Remind me to send them medals.
- What's the matter? Are you yellow?

1470
01:55:37,752 --> 01:55:41,085
- Want me to break you in half?
- Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

1471
01:55:41,255 --> 01:55:43,553
I've been living with letters
for 13 months.

1472
01:55:43,724 --> 01:55:47,626
- There's nothing we can do about it.
- That's what you think.

1473
01:55:54,869 --> 01:55:57,565
May I come in? Please.

1474
01:55:57,972 --> 01:56:01,203
I should've phoned you,
but I didn't have time.

1475
01:56:01,676 --> 01:56:03,507
Pat, we've got a problem.

1476
01:56:03,678 --> 01:56:06,772
It's been reported to me
Andy plans to desert.

1477
01:56:06,948 --> 01:56:09,610
I didn't stop him from jumping ship.
I could have.

1478
01:56:09,784 --> 01:56:13,618
I can have him taken back in irons now,
but I don't want that.

1479
01:56:13,788 --> 01:56:17,622
I want that boy to come back
to his ship on his own two feet.

1480
01:56:17,892 --> 01:56:21,851
It's been extremely difficult,
but I've had to discipline myself...

1481
01:56:22,029 --> 01:56:24,793
...never to interfere in the personal affairs
of my men.

1482
01:56:24,966 --> 01:56:27,491
This is one time I'm forced to.
I have no choice.

1483
01:56:28,035 --> 01:56:30,265
I like you too much.

1484
01:56:30,438 --> 01:56:34,841
As Andy's commanding officer,
I certainly can't sanction this behavior.

1485
01:56:35,242 --> 01:56:37,176
As a man, I do understand it.

1486
01:56:40,481 --> 01:56:42,972
Pat, you've done a lot for this boy.

1487
01:56:43,150 --> 01:56:45,175
You've given him his place in life.

1488
01:56:45,353 --> 01:56:48,117
You can't let him betray himself now.

1489
01:56:48,289 --> 01:56:51,190
Betray him to what, Colonel Huxley,
his grave?

1490
01:56:51,359 --> 01:56:53,919
I haven't forgotten about another boy...

1491
01:56:54,095 --> 01:56:56,529
...a boy who was buried at El Alamein.

1492
01:56:56,697 --> 01:57:00,565
Do you think you and Andy
could ever live in peace?

1493
01:57:01,135 --> 01:57:05,128
This would destroy both of you,
even if you got away with it.

1494
01:57:05,306 --> 01:57:08,036
I knew this was going to happen.
Why did I let it?

1495
01:57:08,275 --> 01:57:10,266
Colonel, where is our war?

1496
01:57:10,444 --> 01:57:12,503
Tell me, why do I have to give him up?

1497
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:16,446
- Tell me.
- He's a man. He has a job to do.

1498
01:57:16,617 --> 01:57:20,246
You're no different than millions
of other women in this war.

1499
01:57:20,421 --> 01:57:23,185
You know what you have to do.

1500
01:57:48,416 --> 01:57:50,111
Andy, hold me.

1501
01:57:50,584 --> 01:57:52,848
Hold me tightly, darling.
Hold me.

1502
01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:56,854
Honey, you're all upset.
I'm here now. I'm here.

1503
01:58:01,629 --> 01:58:03,324
I'm not going back to the ship.

1504
01:58:05,700 --> 01:58:08,066
I said I'm not going back.

1505
01:58:09,070 --> 01:58:10,799
I expected it.

1506
01:58:10,971 --> 01:58:13,838
We can make it.
I got it all figured out.

1507
01:58:14,008 --> 01:58:17,569
I got a place in Ngaio where I can hide.
Then we'll make a run for it.

1508
01:58:17,745 --> 01:58:20,908
Fly to a south island, maybe Australia.

1509
01:58:21,082 --> 01:58:24,051
Three or four years, we can come back.

1510
01:58:24,218 --> 01:58:26,709
All right, Andy.

1511
01:58:26,887 --> 01:58:29,082
You mean it, honey?

1512
01:58:29,590 --> 01:58:32,058
- You really mean it?
- Yes, Andy.

1513
01:58:32,860 --> 01:58:35,761
We'd best pack right away.

1514
01:58:35,930 --> 01:58:39,093
- I'd better not take your radio.
- What do you mean?

1515
01:58:39,266 --> 01:58:42,258
You don't want to hear it
when your battalion lands.

1516
01:58:42,436 --> 01:58:44,301
What will we call the baby?

1517
01:58:44,472 --> 01:58:46,565
We should have
a nice, common name.

1518
01:58:46,741 --> 01:58:49,972
We won't be able
to give him our own, you know.

1519
01:58:51,178 --> 01:58:54,841
- Let's not worry about that too much.
- Cut it out.

1520
01:58:56,050 --> 01:58:58,848
We'll have to change our own name
every month anyway.

1521
01:58:59,653 --> 01:59:02,178
We should start out with Smith.

1522
01:59:02,356 --> 01:59:04,756
We'll call the baby Joe Smith.

1523
01:59:04,925 --> 01:59:08,827
- It's a pretty name, isn't it?
- You're just trying to get me riled up.

1524
01:59:08,996 --> 01:59:11,931
- No, I'll go with you.
- What do we owe this lousy war?

1525
01:59:12,099 --> 01:59:15,660
- What do we owe the Marines?
- Each other.

1526
01:59:15,836 --> 01:59:18,304
You don't care any for me.

1527
01:59:18,472 --> 01:59:20,906
You'll have your baby.
That's all you want.

1528
01:59:21,075 --> 01:59:24,169
How dare you speak to me like that?
How dare you?

1529
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:27,806
I didn't mean it, Pat.

1530
01:59:27,982 --> 01:59:30,473
I didn't mean it.
I'm just going out of my mind.

1531
01:59:30,651 --> 01:59:35,020
- I didn't mean it.
- Andy, if that's what you want, I'll go.

1532
01:59:53,474 --> 01:59:55,635
I must be crazy, Pat.

1533
01:59:55,810 --> 01:59:59,177
Crazy to even ask for something
like this.

1534
02:00:00,381 --> 02:00:04,112
I'd never be able to look my kid
in the face.

1535
02:00:04,285 --> 02:00:06,753
I'd lose you too.

1536
02:00:08,022 --> 02:00:10,718
I don't know why I ever asked.

1537
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:15,194
I better get back to the ship.

1538
02:00:16,463 --> 02:00:20,797
- I'll go with you.
- No, I better go alone.

1539
02:00:22,536 --> 02:00:24,868
Do you love me, Pat?

1540
02:00:26,340 --> 02:00:29,571
Very much, Andy,
very, very much.

1541
02:00:29,743 --> 02:00:32,303
You'll write to me, won't you?

1542
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:37,107
Don't worry none if you don't
hear from me, being aboard ship and all.

1543
02:00:38,018 --> 02:00:41,181
Take good care of yourself
and the baby.

1544
02:00:41,355 --> 02:00:43,323
Get up to the farm.

1545
02:00:45,626 --> 02:00:48,823
If we're lucky, we'll get back here soon.

1546
02:00:49,697 --> 02:00:52,962
But I'll be back as soon as I can.

1547
02:00:54,335 --> 02:00:58,032
- You're not sorry about us?
- No.

1548
02:01:01,575 --> 02:01:04,703
Just tell me once more
how you love me.

1549
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:08,944
I love you, Andy.

1550
02:01:09,116 --> 02:01:11,277
I love you.

1551
02:01:44,785 --> 02:01:50,018
<i>Tarawa. A name to go down with</i>
<i>Bunker Hill, Gettysburg and the Alamo.</i>

1552
02:01:50,190 --> 02:01:52,556
<i>Every man in Huxley's battalion</i>
<i>had been positive...</i>

1553
02:01:52,726 --> 02:01:55,194
<i>... that this time we'd lead</i>
<i>the division into the beach.</i>

1554
02:01:55,362 --> 02:01:57,023
<i>And then the word came through.</i>

1555
02:01:57,197 --> 02:02:00,360
<i>We were being used as</i>
<i>the mop-up boys again, the also-rans...</i>

1556
02:02:00,534 --> 02:02:04,265
<i>... sealed in our ships while the rest</i>
<i>of the division fought the battle.</i>

1557
02:02:04,438 --> 02:02:07,373
<i>When the smoke cleared and what was</i>
<i>left of the division limped off...</i>

1558
02:02:07,541 --> 02:02:11,705
<i>... they again told Huxley that he must</i>
<i>find the elusive Japanese garrison...</i>

1559
02:02:11,879 --> 02:02:15,542
<i>... who, this time, were hidden</i>
<i>in 45 miles of island atolls.</i>

1560
02:02:15,716 --> 02:02:18,082
<i>We cornered them after</i>
<i>a four-day chase...</i>

1561
02:02:18,252 --> 02:02:21,415
<i>... and in a brief skirmish,</i>
<i>we closed the chapter on Tarawa.</i>

1562
02:02:21,588 --> 02:02:25,388
<i>Our casualties were light,</i>
<i>but we left behind...</i>

1563
02:02:25,559 --> 02:02:28,494
<i>... the kid who might have</i>
<i>written the great American war novel...</i>

1564
02:02:28,662 --> 02:02:32,462
<i>... Corporal Marion Hotchkiss,</i>
<i>Sister Mary.</i>

1565
02:02:41,675 --> 02:02:46,942
<i>Then, January 1944, we made</i>
<i>a 2500-mile voyage to rejoin the division.</i>

1566
02:02:47,114 --> 02:02:49,844
<i>Huxley's Harlots, the orphans</i>
<i>of the Marine Corps.</i>

1567
02:02:50,017 --> 02:02:52,713
<i>Always a bridesmaid,</i>
<i>but never a bride.</i>

1568
02:02:52,886 --> 02:02:57,619
<i>On one of the remote islands of Hawaii</i>
<i>we were dumped on a desolate camp...</i>

1569
02:02:57,791 --> 02:03:02,956
<i>... and for all practical purposes,</i>
<i>disappeared from the face of the earth.</i>

1570
02:03:05,566 --> 02:03:07,295
- Good morning, sir.
- Jim.

1571
02:03:08,102 --> 02:03:11,003
Sir, we just received word
from Headquarters.

1572
02:03:11,171 --> 02:03:14,334
The 1 st and 3rd Battalions move out
with the rest of the division.

1573
02:03:14,508 --> 02:03:18,467
We're to stand by, break camp,
and follow in five days...

1574
02:03:18,645 --> 02:03:20,704
...which means we're in reserve again.

1575
02:03:20,881 --> 02:03:24,044
We take this battalion in reserve again
over my dead body.

1576
02:03:24,218 --> 02:03:27,415
- Jim, get my jeep for me, please.
- Yes, sir.

1577
02:03:33,027 --> 02:03:36,224
You didn't waste any time
in getting over here.

1578
02:03:38,032 --> 02:03:40,660
You requested permission.
What's on your mind?

1579
02:03:40,834 --> 02:03:44,998
General, the rest of the division
is getting ready to move out.

1580
02:03:45,172 --> 02:03:48,608
My outfit is ordered to stand by
in Hawaii.

1581
02:03:48,776 --> 02:03:51,973
- We won't leave them there.
- No, sir.

1582
02:03:52,146 --> 02:03:55,604
But if you have us scheduled
as reserves again in this campaign...

1583
02:03:55,783 --> 02:03:57,580
Just a minute, Huxley.

1584
02:03:57,751 --> 02:04:00,549
You don't like your assignment?

1585
02:04:01,789 --> 02:04:03,154
No, sir, I don't.

1586
02:04:05,659 --> 02:04:09,652
Then I see no reason to carry
this conversation on any further.

1587
02:04:10,130 --> 02:04:12,690
Will the general
listen to my request?

1588
02:04:15,235 --> 02:04:18,136
You're getting quite a reputation
as a troublemaker.

1589
02:04:19,039 --> 02:04:21,439
You went out of channels
on Guadalcanal...

1590
02:04:21,608 --> 02:04:25,669
...to try to get your battalion
reassigned to a beachhead.

1591
02:04:26,580 --> 02:04:31,210
Sir, no man in this Corps
loves it any more than I do.

1592
02:04:31,385 --> 02:04:35,253
No one has a greater respect
for military custom.

1593
02:04:35,789 --> 02:04:37,654
But those boys of mine
have worked hard.

1594
02:04:37,825 --> 02:04:40,020
I have the greatest bunch
of boys in the world...

1595
02:04:40,194 --> 02:04:43,220
...but they've got to have
a chance to prove themselves.

1596
02:04:43,397 --> 02:04:46,161
You can't train a champion
to a fighting edge...

1597
02:04:46,333 --> 02:04:49,359
...and then just throw him away
on exhibition matches.

1598
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:54,405
We've sat in reserve and mopped up
while the war went past us.

1599
02:04:54,575 --> 02:04:57,738
This may be our last chance, sir.

1600
02:04:58,979 --> 02:05:00,879
Give it to us.

1601
02:05:06,820 --> 02:05:08,685
Come here, Huxley.

1602
02:05:11,058 --> 02:05:12,787
Ever see one of these?

1603
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:16,020
The complete plan
for the Saipan Operation.

1604
02:05:16,430 --> 02:05:18,762
Hundreds and thousands of pages.

1605
02:05:18,932 --> 02:05:20,900
Intelligence. Naval gunfire.

1606
02:05:21,068 --> 02:05:25,562
Communications. Artillery.
Landing plan. Engineer.

1607
02:05:25,739 --> 02:05:29,334
The personal history
of the enemy commander.

1608
02:05:29,510 --> 02:05:32,377
Name it, you'll find it there.

1609
02:05:38,452 --> 02:05:40,044
Three divisions.

1610
02:05:40,220 --> 02:05:44,418
Sixty-thousand men are storming Saipan...

1611
02:05:44,858 --> 02:05:49,795
...to give us a base to bomb
the Japanese land round the clock.

1612
02:05:50,531 --> 02:05:54,092
But you're ready to question
the labor that went into that plan...

1613
02:05:54,268 --> 02:05:58,466
...just because you don't like
your assignment. Who do you think you are?

1614
02:05:59,540 --> 02:06:03,306
You can take that book
and throw it in the ocean.

1615
02:06:03,477 --> 02:06:07,641
You know as well as I do the book is dead
when the first shot's fired.

1616
02:06:07,814 --> 02:06:10,578
It wasn't a book that won us
Guadalcanal.

1617
02:06:10,751 --> 02:06:14,744
It wasn't a book that kept those boys
coming through the lagoon in Tarawa.

1618
02:06:14,922 --> 02:06:20,485
It's those men with the rifles and the guts
that's gonna win your war for you.

1619
02:06:20,661 --> 02:06:22,754
We want that beachhead.

1620
02:06:24,198 --> 02:06:27,964
Once upon a time, we used to think
you were a bright young man.

1621
02:06:28,135 --> 02:06:31,195
There is such a thing
as insubordination.

1622
02:06:32,739 --> 02:06:36,698
When I came to you, I knew
I'd leave here one of two ways:

1623
02:06:37,778 --> 02:06:41,373
In command of my battalion
or by the brig.

1624
02:06:42,049 --> 02:06:47,487
You might as well court-martial me, sir,
because I'm not going back to my boys...

1625
02:06:47,654 --> 02:06:51,750
...and tell them that they're gonna carry
a broom and dustpan again.

1626
02:06:54,528 --> 02:06:57,554
You stuck your neck out
a long way.

1627
02:07:01,134 --> 02:07:04,126
Stand by until I can put through
a change in these orders.

1628
02:07:04,304 --> 02:07:08,035
I'm sending your battalion in
on the exposed left flank of Red Beach.

1629
02:07:08,508 --> 02:07:12,000
It's the hot spot
of the Saipan Campaign.

1630
02:07:12,212 --> 02:07:14,476
You can be proud of your victory.

1631
02:07:16,483 --> 02:07:19,213
That's all. Get out of here.

1632
02:07:24,324 --> 02:07:25,313
Sam...

1633
02:07:27,327 --> 02:07:31,991
Sometimes I think myself
it's a hell of a way to make a living.

1634
02:07:42,476 --> 02:07:47,345
<i>And so on June 14, 1944,</i>
<i>our task force of the 5th Fleet...</i>

1635
02:07:47,514 --> 02:07:52,645
<i>... the mightiest armada ever assembled,</i>
<i>edged close to the enemy bastion of Saipan.</i>

1636
02:07:52,819 --> 02:07:54,480
<i>The dawn would bring D-day.</i>

1637
02:07:54,655 --> 02:07:58,853
<i>Through the long night, more than</i>
<i>100,000 men made their peace with God.</i>

1638
02:07:59,026 --> 02:08:01,824
<i>No longer orphans,</i>
<i>Huxley's Harlots were at last...</i>

1639
02:08:01,995 --> 02:08:04,190
<i>... being given the chance</i>
<i>to prove themselves.</i>

1640
02:08:04,364 --> 02:08:06,992
<i>The chance they'd worked for</i>
<i>since boot camp.</i>

1641
02:08:07,167 --> 02:08:11,501
<i>We were to spearhead the invasion</i>
<i>that could tip the balance of the war.</i>

1642
02:08:11,672 --> 02:08:14,232
<i>Then the most intricate</i>
<i>of all military operations...</i>

1643
02:08:14,408 --> 02:08:16,569
<i>... an amphibious invasion,</i>
<i>was begun.</i>

1644
02:08:16,743 --> 02:08:20,235
<i>Every man on every ship was at his station.</i>
<i>Every man knew his job.</i>

1645
02:08:20,647 --> 02:08:23,616
<i>The assault teams formed up smoothly</i>
<i>and moved to rendezvous.</i>

1646
02:08:23,784 --> 02:08:26,082
<i>As H-hour approached,</i>
<i>the tension grew.</i>

1647
02:08:26,253 --> 02:08:31,054
<i>The men who had planned and lived</i>
<i>with Operation Granite on paper for months...</i>

1648
02:08:31,224 --> 02:08:32,987
<i>... had no choice but to wait.</i>

1649
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:35,355
<i>The final seconds ticked off.</i>

1650
02:09:22,442 --> 02:09:24,205
- Get Major Wellman.
- Yes, sir.

1651
02:09:24,378 --> 02:09:25,811
Put on Texas-5.

1652
02:09:26,646 --> 02:09:29,114
This is Texas-5.

1653
02:09:29,583 --> 02:09:31,346
Wilco. Out.

1654
02:09:42,095 --> 02:09:46,259
- Approaching the beach.
- All right, stand by to hit the beach!

1655
02:09:46,433 --> 02:09:48,128
Secure your gear.

1656
02:09:48,301 --> 02:09:50,269
When we hit it, take cover!

1657
02:10:12,726 --> 02:10:17,322
<i>Red Beach. We pushed inland immediately.</i>
<i>The battalion was in trouble.</i>

1658
02:10:17,497 --> 02:10:19,192
<i>Our casualties were heavy.</i>

1659
02:10:19,366 --> 02:10:21,766
<i>The Japs were on a mountain,</i>
<i>looking down.</i>

1660
02:10:21,935 --> 02:10:25,427
<i>They threw everything in the book.</i>
<i>And things that weren't in the book.</i>

1661
02:10:25,605 --> 02:10:28,597
<i>The enemy was staging a counterattack</i>
<i>from our left.</i>

1662
02:10:28,775 --> 02:10:32,040
<i>Our right flank was threatened.</i>
<i>A shuttle service from ship to shore...</i>

1663
02:10:32,212 --> 02:10:36,672
<i>... poured men, guns, tanks and supplies in</i>
<i>behind us to secure our toehold before dark.</i>

1664
02:10:36,850 --> 02:10:40,445
- Get off this beach! Let's go!
- Get off the beach!

1665
02:10:54,768 --> 02:10:56,497
All right, let's go!

1666
02:12:18,318 --> 02:12:20,218
Hit the deck!

1667
02:12:24,891 --> 02:12:28,952
Tell Regiment the enemy
artillery fire is increasing.

1668
02:12:29,129 --> 02:12:33,259
Ohio, Ohio, this is Texas, over.

1669
02:12:33,433 --> 02:12:37,631
Enemy artillery fire is increasing,
out.

1670
02:12:45,779 --> 02:12:51,581
- Tell 8-G, field is quick, charge thick.
- 2750, 6700.

1671
02:12:55,622 --> 02:12:59,888
Ohio, this is Texas.
Texas command post open 13-20.

1672
02:13:00,060 --> 02:13:04,497
Map coordinates 39-54.8.

1673
02:13:05,632 --> 02:13:07,190
- Hi, Mac.
- Hello, chief.

1674
02:13:07,367 --> 02:13:09,597
- How's it going, colonel?
- Not very good.

1675
02:13:09,769 --> 02:13:12,636
We've lost contact with the battalion
on our right flank.

1676
02:13:12,806 --> 02:13:16,537
I told George Company to see
if they can get through to them.

1677
02:13:19,746 --> 02:13:21,737
Get on this generator!

1678
02:13:24,484 --> 02:13:27,282
- Give me George Company.
- George Company. Yes, sir.

1679
02:13:27,454 --> 02:13:29,547
Get the company commander.

1680
02:13:41,635 --> 02:13:45,594
- This is George-6.
- How are things up there?

1681
02:13:45,772 --> 02:13:48,206
- Can you hold?
- I don't think so.

1682
02:13:48,375 --> 02:13:50,935
We're receiving heavy mortar fire
on our right.

1683
02:13:51,111 --> 02:13:52,601
All right.

1684
02:13:52,779 --> 02:13:57,113
Jim, let's get some mortar fire
at TA-4606-yolk.

1685
02:13:57,283 --> 02:13:58,773
George Company will observe.

1686
02:13:58,952 --> 02:14:02,353
Heavy mortars, target area 4807-item.

1687
02:14:14,067 --> 02:14:17,935
- Japs still trying to tap our lines?
- Yes, but it won't do them no good.

1688
02:14:18,104 --> 02:14:23,371
They don't savvy Navajo. Get in touch
with them. See what the situation is.

1689
02:14:46,199 --> 02:14:48,167
Japs' buildup is increasing.

1690
02:14:48,334 --> 02:14:51,360
Let's get that back
to the command ship.

1691
02:14:53,840 --> 02:14:56,570
Granite. Granite, this is Texas.

1692
02:14:58,445 --> 02:15:01,846
A message from Texas.
Red Beach, sir.

1693
02:15:04,984 --> 02:15:07,976
Huxley's battalion is isolated.

1694
02:15:09,723 --> 02:15:11,418
Yes, sir? Yes, sir.

1695
02:15:11,591 --> 02:15:14,059
Fox Company, Colonel Huxley.

1696
02:15:17,330 --> 02:15:20,822
Yes, Bill.
I'll be right there.

1697
02:15:21,367 --> 02:15:24,962
The Japs are pulling out of Garapan.
They'll hit that position anytime.

1698
02:15:25,138 --> 02:15:27,936
- I'm going over to Fox Company. Mac!
- Sir?

1699
02:15:28,108 --> 02:15:31,566
- Give me one of your boys.
- Hookens, take off.

1700
02:15:51,564 --> 02:15:54,055
- We'll cross here one at a time.
- Yes, sir.

1701
02:16:22,729 --> 02:16:25,960
Get a corpsman.
Get a corpsman!

1702
02:16:29,536 --> 02:16:31,731
Don't waste time.

1703
02:16:32,906 --> 02:16:36,000
Get to the command post...

1704
02:16:36,176 --> 02:16:39,043
...and tell Wellman
he's got himself a battalion.

1705
02:16:39,212 --> 02:16:42,978
- I'll carry you out, sir.
- I gave you an order.

1706
02:16:43,149 --> 02:16:45,344
Now, get to it.

1707
02:16:47,587 --> 02:16:50,112
You're bleeding to death, sir!

1708
02:16:51,457 --> 02:16:53,288
Get out of here.

1709
02:16:54,694 --> 02:16:55,956
Yes, sir.

1710
02:17:09,742 --> 02:17:12,609
The colonel's badly hit.
He's ordered you to take over.

1711
02:17:12,779 --> 02:17:17,113
- Notify command.
- Where is he? Pedro, come on.

1712
02:19:11,331 --> 02:19:12,730
Corpsman! Corpsman!

1713
02:19:45,665 --> 02:19:47,860
- Kathy.
- Danny's dead!

1714
02:19:48,034 --> 02:19:51,060
- He's dead! I know he's dead!
- It's just a nightmare.

1715
02:19:51,237 --> 02:19:55,606
- No, he's dead. I know it! I saw him!
- Baby, you're just dreaming.

1716
02:19:55,775 --> 02:19:59,040
Everything will be all right.
It'll be all right.

1717
02:19:59,212 --> 02:20:02,306
If you like, I'll stay here with you.

1718
02:20:03,082 --> 02:20:05,277
All right.

1719
02:20:08,187 --> 02:20:12,590
<i>High Pockets was dead, but his spirit</i>
<i>had crushed the counterattack.</i>

1720
02:20:13,026 --> 02:20:15,756
<i>"Sam Huxley!" had been our battle cry.</i>

1721
02:20:15,928 --> 02:20:19,659
<i>When the last shot had been fired,</i>
<i>they moved us to a rest camp.</i>

1722
02:20:19,832 --> 02:20:21,629
We're leaving Saipan.

1723
02:20:21,801 --> 02:20:23,496
- We're going stateside.
- When?

1724
02:20:23,669 --> 02:20:25,830
About two days, I figure.

1725
02:20:26,406 --> 02:20:28,806
I think I'll go to the hospital
and say goodbye to Andy.

1726
02:20:28,975 --> 02:20:32,877
Won't do no good. We was over there
this morning, but Andy threw us out.

1727
02:20:33,046 --> 02:20:35,742
Had a letter from Pat,
but he wouldn't look at it...

1728
02:20:35,915 --> 02:20:37,974
...wouldn't even let us read it to him.

1729
02:20:38,151 --> 02:20:41,143
- Where's the letter?
- I got it right here.

1730
02:20:46,692 --> 02:20:48,023
Just like a grizzly bear.

1731
02:20:51,731 --> 02:20:54,291
- Hey, Mac.
- Hi, Charlie, how are you?

1732
02:20:54,467 --> 02:20:57,493
Remember that Japanese watch I had?
Somebody copped it.

1733
02:20:57,670 --> 02:21:00,161
- No kidding, when?
- Last night.

1734
02:21:16,222 --> 02:21:18,816
- Joe, how are you?
- Hi, Mac.

1735
02:21:21,394 --> 02:21:24,192
I can't hear you, Mac.
I'm a very sick boy.

1736
02:21:24,831 --> 02:21:28,096
The watch. The watch.

1737
02:21:28,267 --> 02:21:29,894
Watch.

1738
02:21:32,638 --> 02:21:36,005
What, are you accusing me
of something dishonest?

1739
02:21:36,175 --> 02:21:37,767
Yeah.

1740
02:21:39,545 --> 02:21:42,912
You gonna open up a hockshop
when you get home?

1741
02:21:43,816 --> 02:21:45,408
How did that get there?

1742
02:21:56,896 --> 02:21:58,386
Hi, buddy. How's it going?

1743
02:21:58,564 --> 02:22:00,930
If you're preaching,
pray with somebody else.

1744
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:03,967
I've just come to say goodbye.
We're shipping out.

1745
02:22:04,137 --> 02:22:06,298
All right. Goodbye.

1746
02:22:06,472 --> 02:22:09,669
- You know you're way off base, don't you?
- Sure.

1747
02:22:09,842 --> 02:22:11,776
They'll get me a pretty, new leg.

1748
02:22:11,944 --> 02:22:17,109
You can do anything with it:
Chop down trees, plow fields.

1749
02:22:17,283 --> 02:22:19,751
Maybe I can even get a job
in a sideshow.

1750
02:22:20,253 --> 02:22:22,881
You got a home and a wife.

1751
02:22:23,055 --> 02:22:25,683
A letter come from Pat today.

1752
02:22:25,858 --> 02:22:30,056
- Fellas said you wouldn't even read it.
- Leave her out of it. I got nothing.

1753
02:22:30,563 --> 02:22:33,396
They'll have you squared away
as good as new in no time.

1754
02:22:33,566 --> 02:22:34,863
Sure.

1755
02:22:35,034 --> 02:22:38,936
They get me fixed up with a pretty, new leg,
then they rehabilitate me.

1756
02:22:39,105 --> 02:22:41,630
Knit doilies and make
leather handbags.

1757
02:22:41,908 --> 02:22:44,001
Cut it out, will you?

1758
02:22:44,177 --> 02:22:47,340
They gonna give Spanish Joe
new eardrums?

1759
02:22:47,513 --> 02:22:50,812
They going to put new life
into Pedro and High Pockets?

1760
02:22:51,150 --> 02:22:53,675
Why don't you try
doing a little living for them?

1761
02:22:53,853 --> 02:22:55,286
Get out of here.

1762
02:22:55,454 --> 02:22:59,652
No. I ain't going. Not until I tell you
something, kid.

1763
02:22:59,825 --> 02:23:03,386
You ain't got the guts
to deserve to live.

1764
02:23:03,563 --> 02:23:09,126
As for High Pockets, don't even talk
about him. You ain't even in his league.

1765
02:23:14,540 --> 02:23:16,770
- I'm sorry, kid.
- Forget it.

1766
02:23:16,943 --> 02:23:19,434
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it, Mac.

1767
02:23:20,213 --> 02:23:23,410
- I'm sorry because it ain't true.
- Look...

1768
02:23:23,583 --> 02:23:26,051
Lots of luck when you get home.

1769
02:23:26,485 --> 02:23:29,977
Tell all the guys old Andy
says goodbye.

1770
02:23:30,156 --> 02:23:32,886
- Will you do that?
- Yeah.

1771
02:23:44,837 --> 02:23:46,600
"Dearest:

1772
02:23:46,772 --> 02:23:48,865
You have a son.

1773
02:23:50,710 --> 02:23:54,373
It's rather hard to say
what Timmy looks like.

1774
02:23:54,547 --> 02:23:59,678
Poor little dear,
what a horrible mixture he is.

1775
02:23:59,885 --> 02:24:03,582
New Zealand, American,
Scotch and Swede.

1776
02:24:03,756 --> 02:24:08,455
He bellows like a Marine
and eats like a lumberjack.

1777
02:24:08,628 --> 02:24:10,255
I think I'll keep him.

1778
02:24:10,429 --> 02:24:12,624
Andy, we know where you are.

1779
02:24:12,798 --> 02:24:16,325
Our prayers are with you
every second of every minute.

1780
02:24:16,502 --> 02:24:21,462
I know it'll be a long time
before you return to us, but remember...

1781
02:24:21,641 --> 02:24:25,133
...all that Timmy and I live for...

1782
02:24:25,645 --> 02:24:28,978
...is the day that you'll
come back forever."

1783
02:25:57,737 --> 02:26:00,137
<i>Yes, Andy came home.</i>

1784
02:26:00,306 --> 02:26:03,833
<i>And those of us who were left,</i>
<i>we went home too.</i>

1785
02:26:04,009 --> 02:26:08,002
<i>I fell heir to the unpleasant job</i>
<i>of seeing the folks of those left behind:</i>

1786
02:26:08,180 --> 02:26:11,616
<i>Pedro's mother. Jean Huxley.</i>
<i>Marion's family.</i>

1787
02:26:11,784 --> 02:26:16,050
<i>The Maryland countryside was just the way</i>
<i>Danny had told me time and time again.</i>

1788
02:26:16,222 --> 02:26:18,554
<i>I seemed to be familiar</i>
<i>with every landmark.</i>

1789
02:26:18,724 --> 02:26:21,249
<i>I was glad the journey</i>
<i>was nearly over.</i>

1790
02:26:21,427 --> 02:26:24,157
<i>As we neared Baltimore,</i>
<i>I remembered High Pockets' words:</i>

1791
02:26:24,330 --> 02:26:26,025
<i>"Make Marines out of them."</i>

1792
02:26:26,198 --> 02:26:29,133
<i>Well, we made Marines out of them.</i>

1793
02:26:29,301 --> 02:26:31,633
<i>And they led us</i>

1797
02:26:48,721 --> 02:26:52,487
Doc says it'll keep doing this
till they get all the shrapnel out.

1798
02:26:52,658 --> 02:26:55,559
- Sure you won't stay over a few days?
- No, thanks, kid.

1799
02:26:55,728 --> 02:26:58,595

<i>For Danny Forrester,</i>
<i>the war was over. For me...</i>

1810
02:27:50,249 --> 02:27:51,978
<i>You know how us old-timers are.</i>

1811
02:27:52,151 --> 02:27:55,746
<i>There will always be boys to be trained</i>
<i>and battles to be won.</i>

1812
02:27:55,921 --> 02:27:57,548
<i>And like I said:</i>

1813
02:27:57,723 --> 02:28:01,682
<i>Politics and wars</i>
<i>make strange bedfellows.</i>
