Oh, God, how depressing.

74
00:07:58,318 --> 00:08:00,696
You're meant to think

75
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:02,614
l've been working on it like mad.

76

-How long have you been here?
-Forever.

85
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:32,602
How long is that?

86
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:33,937
Almost three months.

87
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:37,065
lt's the most marvelous boarding house.
Marvelous lodgers.

88
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:39,818
Everybody's broke, of course,
but who isn't these days?

89
00:08:39,943 --> 00:08:43,322
Now there's Fraulein Mayr,
who is a masseuse...for ladies only.

90
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:46,742
And there's Fraulein Kost,
who's a terribly sweet streetwalker.

91
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,957
Fraulein Kost, Fraulein Mayr.

92
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,673
Mayr tells Kost's fortune every morning.
lt's always the same.

93
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:05,802
''You'll meet a strange man,'' which, under
the circumstances, is a pretty safe bet.

94
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:08,138
The toilet.

95
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:12,142
Fraulein Kost's room.
Oh, you can just imagine.

96
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,978
Here it is, darling.

97
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:22,027
Well, what else do you need in a bedroom
besides a bed?

98
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:26,239
Pupils. l've got to give English lessons
to pay the rent.

99
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:28,909
Well, look, you can use my room for that.

100
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,787
See? Practically a suite. Come on in.

101
00:09:34,623 --> 00:09:35,791
You'll adore these.

102
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,085
Prairie oysters, darling.

103
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:41,713
lt's an egg with Worcestershire sauce,
all sort of whooshed up together.

104
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:46,593
Fifty marks with breakfast,
even when l'm behind on the rent.

105
00:09:46,802 --> 00:09:48,053
Divine, isn't it?

106
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,889
-Of course, l'm hardly ever in.
-Why not?

107
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:54,184
Well, l dash all day
and l work late at the Cabaret.

108
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,356
Now...these work instantly,
even on the most sinister hangovers.

109
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,318
Of course, l may bring a boyfriend home
occasionally, but only occasionally...

110
00:10:03,527 --> 00:10:06,863
...because l do think that one ought
to go to the man's room if one can.

111
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,618
l mean, it doesn't look so much
as if one expected it, does it?

112
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:13,954
Exactly.

113
00:10:16,373 --> 00:10:18,875
l see you've acquired a lot
of worldly wisdom.

114
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:22,337
Oh, not wisdom, darling, instincts.
l have ancient instincts.

115
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:25,632
l have this strange, mystical...

116
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:29,177
...thatish feeling about you.

117

118

Oh, you've got to try one of these.
They're absolutely devastating.

178
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,920
l'm sure they're filled with opium,
or some such thing.

179
00:16:37,004 --> 00:16:39,089
They make me feel wildly sensual.

180
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,549
Till later.

181
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:51,727
She's hot stuff, yes?

182
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:54,438
No, thank you.

183
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:04,948
Oh, you're not mistaking me.
We do not sleep on each other.

184
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:07,534
That is correct? ''On?''

185
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:09,786
''With.''

186
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,996
''With.''

187
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,460
Linken Lieselotte...

188
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:19,463
...72 kilos.

189
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:25,052
Her father, you know,
is a big ambassador from Washington.

190
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,553
An ambassador?

191
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:27,846
Oh, yes, dear chap.

192
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:32,643
And soon, with her, l think,
l am entering the high diplomatic circles.

193
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:35,812
Strict rules will be obeyed.

194
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,609
Sally tells me, sir, that you're
from Oxford University.

195
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:42,235
A professor of language.

196
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:44,696
Well, it's, it's Cambridge,
actually, and l'm...

197
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,865
...l'm still working for
my doctor of philosophy.

198
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:48,617
That's why l'm here.

199
00:17:49,117 --> 00:17:52,037
But, if you really want lessons,
l'd be pleased to help.

200
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,121
Excellent.

201
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:54,456
Start!

202
00:17:55,624 --> 00:17:56,917
For the sport!

203
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:02,714
lf it's not...if it's not too expensive.
You know, business is...

204
00:18:02,756 --> 00:18:03,757
...business is terrible.

205
00:18:05,342 --> 00:18:07,803
The inflation, the Communists...

206
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:09,972
...the Nazis.

207
00:18:10,514 --> 00:18:12,349
Soon l am with a tin cup, too...

208
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,186
...or l make a rich marriage.

209
00:18:18,105 --> 00:18:19,731
That at least is sensible.

210
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,270
l suppose you're wondering
what l'm doing...

211
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:42,147
...working in a place like the Kit Kat Klub?

212
00:19:42,522 --> 00:19:44,483
lt is a rather unusual place.

213
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:48,487
That's me, darling...
unusual places, unusual love affairs.

214
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,448
l am a most strange
and extraordinary person.

215
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:59,873
Now, tell me all about you.
l want to hear everything.

216
00:20:00,624 --> 00:20:01,875
Everything?

217
00:20:02,626 --> 00:20:04,294
Absolutely everything.

218
00:20:07,631 --> 00:20:10,133
Well, there's nothing very dramatic to tell.

219
00:20:11,385 --> 00:20:13,136
Well, since l've been down
from Cambridge, l--

220
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,098
Lya de Putti.
Absolutely my favorite screen siren.

221
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,433
Well, when l left Cambridge, l--

222
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,602
l'm going to be a great film star.

223
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:24,523
That is, if booze and sex
don't get me first.

224
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:27,734
Do l shock you, darling?

225
00:20:27,818 --> 00:20:28,902
Not a bit.

226
00:20:29,236 --> 00:20:30,195
l don't?

227
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:34,783
Since mother died we're even closer.

228
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:36,660
He's an ambassador, l understand.

229
00:20:36,743 --> 00:20:37,869
Who told you that?

230
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:38,996
Fritz Wendel.

231
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,622
Oh, Fritz.

232
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,125
He's practically an ambassador.

233
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:45,627
Where is he now?

234
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,714
Oh, who knows?
Timbuctoo, outer Mongolia.

235
00:20:49,506 --> 00:20:52,759
He dashes all over the globe
on momentous affairs of state.

236
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,222
Then, you don't see much of him.

237
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,600
Darling, what are you talking about?
Of course l do.

238
00:21:00,684 --> 00:21:02,644
He can't bear us being apart.

239
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:06,898
He's always swooping down
and carrying me off for divine vacations.

240
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,526
The Riviera, Capri.

241
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,821
Have you ever slept with a dwarf?

242
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:15,741
Once, but it wasn't a lasting relationship.

243
00:21:18,994 --> 00:21:22,581
Oh, l know l can sing,
but what l really want to be is an actress.

244
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:24,875
Like...who is it?

245
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:27,085
Lya de Putti?

246
00:21:27,544 --> 00:21:30,797
Oh, darling, come on.
l could act her right off the screen.

247
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:35,969
l thought you said she was your favorite.

248
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:38,055
She makes too many faces.

249
00:21:38,305 --> 00:21:39,222
No, please....

250
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,766
We made an agreement.

251
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:43,644
Thank you.

252
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:45,854
Just you wait.

253
00:21:47,731 --> 00:21:50,984
One of these days Max Reinhardt
is gonna drift into the club.

254
00:21:51,234 --> 00:21:52,653
Well, you never know.

255
00:21:52,736 --> 00:21:54,321
That's right, you never know.

256
00:21:54,404 --> 00:21:55,989
lt has happened before.

257
00:21:57,532 --> 00:21:59,951
What, just last week,
a man who's a very good friend...

258
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:03,664
...of the head of casting for UFA
asked me to sit at his table, and he's....

259
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,710
Come on. Come on.

260
00:22:09,002 --> 00:22:10,712
Run, run!

261
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:13,882
Where?

262
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:42,327
Excuse me, miss....

263
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,746
Didn't you just scream?

264
00:22:46,623 --> 00:22:48,917
Does my company upset you that much?

265
00:22:50,544 --> 00:22:53,046
You know, sometimes l come down here
and just wait.

266
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,798
l mean, just especially.

267
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,717
You should try it sometime.

268
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,759
Me?

269
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,638
Yes.

270
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:02,889
Me?

271
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:05,600
-You.
-No.

272
00:23:05,976 --> 00:23:07,185
Yes, you.

273
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,313
Go on.

274
00:23:09,396 --> 00:23:10,897
l couldn't possibly.

275
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:12,524
Don't be so British.

276
00:23:14,735 --> 00:23:16,862
You'll feel terrific afterwards.

277
00:23:18,238 --> 00:23:19,489
You know you want to.

278
00:23:19,573 --> 00:23:20,741
No, l don't.

279
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,454
Here comes one now.

280
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:29,458
-Will you do it?
-All right.

281
00:23:32,502 --> 00:23:33,795
No, not yet.

282
00:23:38,091 --> 00:23:39,509
Okay, you ready?

283
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,553
Now.

284
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:45,117
l can't promise you anything,
but we can give it a try.

285
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,369
Darling, l want you to meet Herr Ludwig.

286
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:48,829
He's just back from Hamburg.

287
00:24:48,912 --> 00:24:52,374
He lives in the room off the kitchen,
and he's a marvelous publisher.

288
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:55,002
Now look, he's got this book,
and it's got to be translated.

289
00:24:55,085 --> 00:24:57,045
And l told him
what a famous writer you are...

290
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,214
...and it's 50 marks. Right?

291
00:25:00,257 --> 00:25:01,300
Fabulous.

292
00:25:01,383 --> 00:25:02,509
lt's all settled.

293
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:05,012
lt will be an honor for me
to associate with...

294
00:25:05,095 --> 00:25:08,557
...so talented a young man of letters
as Miss Bowles tells me.

295
00:25:08,682 --> 00:25:11,560
This book, l assure you,
is most artistic...

296
00:25:11,935 --> 00:25:13,729
...most artistic and color--

297
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,772
Twenty-five marks in advance. Right?

298
00:25:17,858 --> 00:25:19,985
l think, Herr Roberts,
you will find the style--

299
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,653
ls there any hot water left?

300
00:25:21,737 --> 00:25:23,572
-Hot water?
-Yes, a little.

301
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:28,160
l think you will find the style admirable...

302
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:32,331
...and the subject matter,
l feel, is universal.

303
00:25:33,874 --> 00:25:35,917
-Cigar?
-No, thank you.

304
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,170
No, you must. lt's the finest Havana.

305
00:25:39,463 --> 00:25:40,589
lt's a deal?

306
00:25:41,882 --> 00:25:45,469
Herr Ludwig, l'm afraid that Sally's
rather overestimated my powers of....

307
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,391
lt's a deal.

308
00:26:07,824 --> 00:26:08,950
That's it.

309
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,746
Fifty marks. Not bad, huh?

310
00:26:14,122 --> 00:26:17,125
Do you know what this artistic
and colorful book's about?

311
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,502
No. Tell, tell.

312
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:20,712
lt's pure pornography.

313
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:24,591
But of course it is, darling.
All of Herr Ludwig's books are dirty books.

314
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,302
What's this one called?

315
00:26:31,515 --> 00:26:33,183
''Cleo, the Whip Lady.''

316
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,982
You lied about the hot water.

317
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:41,900
l'm freezing.

318
00:26:42,192 --> 00:26:43,777
l'm freezing to death.

319
00:26:44,444 --> 00:26:45,570
Hug me?

320
00:26:48,699 --> 00:26:49,783
Tighter.

321
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:00,127
Don't be so literal.

322
00:28:02,272 --> 00:28:04,900
Doesn't my body
drive you wild with desire?

323
00:28:07,694 --> 00:28:09,029
Doesn't it?

324
00:28:11,698 --> 00:28:13,033
lt's a very nice body.

325
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,786
Do you really think so, darling?

326
00:28:16,703 --> 00:28:18,664
lt does have a certain kind of style.

327
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:21,583
l mean, look, it's very flat here...

328
00:28:22,876 --> 00:28:24,294
...not much hips, and...

329
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:28,924
...here....

330
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:34,429
lt's a little early in the day
for this sort of thing, isn't it?

331
00:28:39,893 --> 00:28:41,937
Maybe you just don't sleep with girls.

332
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:49,319
You don't.

333
00:28:53,323 --> 00:28:57,536
Well, listen, we're practically
living together, so if you only like boys...

334
00:28:57,786 --> 00:28:59,913
...l mean, l wouldn't dream
of pestering you.

335
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:03,834
Well, do you sleep with girls, or don't you?

336
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:06,295
You don't ask questions like that.

337
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:07,713
l do.

338
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:12,843
All right.

339
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,012
lf you insist.

340
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,681
l do not sleep with girls.

341
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,226
Let me be absolutely accurate.

342
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,855
l've gone through the motions
of sleeping with girls exactly...

343
00:29:25,355 --> 00:29:26,356
...three times.

344
00:29:27,357 --> 00:29:29,276
All of them disastrous.

345
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,823
The word for my sex life now is...

346
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:36,908
...''nil,'' or...

347
00:29:37,492 --> 00:29:38,994
...as you Americans would say...

348
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,370
...''plenty of nuttin'''!

349
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,376
All right?

350
00:29:56,887 --> 00:29:58,930
Why didn't you tell me in the first place?

351
00:30:01,183 --> 00:30:02,476
Look, Brian.

352
00:30:03,393 --> 00:30:05,437
You're absolutely my best friend.

353
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,607
And friends are much harder to find
than lovers.

354
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:12,319
Besides, sex always screws up
a friendship, anyway, if you let it.

355
00:30:14,154 --> 00:30:15,697
So we won't let it.

356
00:30:20,744 --> 00:30:21,953
Okay, Sally.

357
00:30:40,514 --> 00:30:43,100
''You would have been,
he would have been....''

358
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:47,437
Pluperfect tense.

359
00:30:48,021 --> 00:30:49,314
''l have been....''

360
00:30:53,026 --> 00:30:56,279
lf you did a little homework,
instead of gadding about all over town....

361
00:30:57,155 --> 00:31:00,158
Fraulein Schneider,
there's a new pupil coming at 3:00.

362
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:02,619
-Would you show her up, please?
-Certainly.

363
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,747
''You had have been, l had have been....''

364
00:31:05,872 --> 00:31:07,165
Future perfect.

365
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,876
''l shall have....''

366
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,337
''l shall have been.'' This English.

367
00:31:12,754 --> 00:31:14,965
l go now to try to pull a deal.

368
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,176
Or l make business soon...

369
00:31:18,593 --> 00:31:20,220
...or l go as a gigolo.

370
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,471
''Either, or.''

371
00:31:21,555 --> 00:31:23,974
''Either, or,'' l go as a gigolo.

372
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,269
Anyway, who is the new pupil?

373
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:29,146
Natalia Landauer.

374
00:31:30,063 --> 00:31:31,106
Landauer?

375
00:31:32,274 --> 00:31:34,067
Of the big department store?

376
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,197
A Landauer?

377
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:44,202
How did you meet a Landauer?

378
00:31:44,953 --> 00:31:47,581
l had a letter of introduction
from England.

379
00:31:47,664 --> 00:31:49,416
They invited me for coffee.

380
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,168
lnvited you for coffee?

381
00:31:54,588 --> 00:31:57,090
Landauers are enormous rich Jews.

382
00:31:58,091 --> 00:31:59,843
Stinking rich, it seems.

383
00:32:10,604 --> 00:32:11,647
Good.

384
00:32:12,105 --> 00:32:14,066
l shall make a pass after her.

385
00:32:15,317 --> 00:32:17,402
What if she's...fat and hideous?

386
00:32:24,618 --> 00:32:28,246
Perhaps the father will take
a liking from me and give me a job.

387
00:32:29,122 --> 00:32:31,458
lf l marry her, a partnership perhaps.

388
00:32:33,835 --> 00:32:35,295
l'm not prejudiced.

389
00:32:38,465 --> 00:32:39,675
Hello.

390
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,969
You said you wouldn't be back until 4:00.

391
00:32:42,052 --> 00:32:44,137
l must have a drink this instant.

392
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:48,725
The new pupil's due at any moment.
Can't the drink wait?

393
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:50,352
Oh, God, only gin.

394
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:52,396
Sally, please!

395
00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:55,524
Three marks an hour. l need it.

396
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,402
-We need it.
-All l need is a drink!

397
00:32:58,485 --> 00:33:01,196
She's young and very strictly brought up.

398
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,407
Look, l may have my tiny faults...

399
00:33:03,699 --> 00:33:07,536
...but l'm really not planning
to white slave her to Latin America.

400
00:33:08,161 --> 00:33:09,663
Whose room is this, anyhow?

401
00:33:11,248 --> 00:33:12,374
Sally, in all fairness--

402
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,626
Fairness? Who cares about fairness?

403
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:23,051
Honestly.

404
00:33:32,436 --> 00:33:33,562
Thank you.

405
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:36,398
You're welcome.

406
00:33:39,693 --> 00:33:41,194
-Excuse me.
-How fat?

407
00:33:42,904 --> 00:33:43,905
How fat?

408
00:33:44,031 --> 00:33:47,117
l think the weather will be fine,
isn't it true, Miss Landauer?

409
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:53,582
Fraulein Landauer.

410
00:33:54,374 --> 00:33:55,417
Come in.

411
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:58,795
-Good afternoon, Fraulein Landauer.
-Good afternoon.

412
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:02,090
-How nice to see you again.
-lt's nice to see you again.

413
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,593
lt is good, you have others.

414
00:34:04,718 --> 00:34:07,804
So, we shall make a party
for speaking English, yes?

415
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:11,600
Well, actually, my friends
were just leaving.

416
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,770
No, l'm delighted to stay, Brian.

417
00:34:18,065 --> 00:34:20,651
Sally, you have this appointment,
don't you?

418
00:34:20,942 --> 00:34:22,778
l'll cancel it. l love parties.

419
00:34:23,236 --> 00:34:25,739
Good, this is splendid for the practicing.

420
00:34:26,114 --> 00:34:27,949
You will introduce me, please.

421
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,035
Yes, of course.

422
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,496
Herr Wendel, Fraulein Landauer.

423
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:36,500
-lt is a pleasure, miss.
-No, no, English conversation.

424
00:34:37,334 --> 00:34:39,252
l am so charmed, dearest miss.

425
00:34:39,795 --> 00:34:41,713
And...and this...

426
00:34:42,631 --> 00:34:45,133
...this is Miss Sally Bowles.

427
00:34:45,425 --> 00:34:46,969
How do you do?

428
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:51,807
Bobby, a Landauer in my house.

429
00:34:57,145 --> 00:34:59,398
Last summer when l....

430
00:35:20,002 --> 00:35:21,628
You are all healthy, l hope.

431
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,387
l have had a cold, but it is better now.

432
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:32,097
Good.

433
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,181
How sad.

434
00:35:34,057 --> 00:35:37,102
A cold from the nose is most aggravating.

435
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:40,731
This was a cold of the bosom,
not of the nose.

436
00:35:41,648 --> 00:35:43,483
All the plegm vas here.

437
00:35:44,234 --> 00:35:45,277
All the what?

438
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:48,822
Ze plegm...zat comes in the tubes.

439
00:35:49,865 --> 00:35:51,616
l think l'm gonna be sick.

440
00:35:52,701 --> 00:35:56,121
Phlegm. ''Ph'' is always pronounced
as ''f'', and...

441
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:58,957
...you don't sound...the ''g.''

442
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:01,168
Then why are they putting the ''g'',
please?

443
00:36:02,711 --> 00:36:04,713
That's a very good question, but...

444
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:06,673
...it's rather difficult to explain.

445
00:36:06,757 --> 00:36:08,050
Try, Brian.

446
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:16,642
lt's just there.

447
00:36:17,017 --> 00:36:20,103
So, Mr. Professor, you do not know?

448
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:21,146
No.

449
00:36:21,855 --> 00:36:24,650
Then l'm sorry, l cannot help you.

450
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:30,072
lt's most amusing.

451
00:36:31,782 --> 00:36:33,116
Very amusing.

452
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:34,785
Come in.

453
00:36:38,455 --> 00:36:40,582
How thoughtful of you,
Fraulein Schneider.

454
00:36:40,874 --> 00:36:42,084
Thank you very much.

455
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,378
You're most welcome, Herr Roberts.

456
00:36:49,883 --> 00:36:50,926
Please.

457
00:36:54,763 --> 00:36:57,432
Please, you must take a cake,
dearest miss.

458
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,518
l'm not eating between meals.

459
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:01,853
You're not eating between meals.

460
00:37:02,729 --> 00:37:04,439
l am eating between meals.

461
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:10,362
Thank you.

462
00:37:10,654 --> 00:37:11,697
So much.

463
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,823
You're welcome.

464
00:37:16,743 --> 00:37:18,412
Brian, Liebling, did l tell you?

465
00:37:18,745 --> 00:37:20,831
l saw a film the other day about syphilis.

466
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,292
lt was too awful.

467
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:25,627
l couldn't let a man touch me for a week.

468
00:37:26,503 --> 00:37:27,546
Coffee?

469
00:37:29,423 --> 00:37:31,133
ls it true you can get it from kissing?

470
00:37:31,425 --> 00:37:32,426
Oh, yes.

471
00:37:32,592 --> 00:37:34,678
And your king, Henry Vlll...

472
00:37:34,845 --> 00:37:37,806
...caught it from letting Cardinal Wolsey
whisper in his ear.

473
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,767
That is not, l think, founded in fact.

474
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:44,563
But from kissing, most decidedly.

475
00:37:45,147 --> 00:37:47,733
And from towels...and from cups.

476
00:37:52,112 --> 00:37:53,572
And, of course, screwing.

477
00:37:58,201 --> 00:37:59,620
''Screwing,'' please?

478
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,040
Fornication.

479
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:07,336
Fornication?

480
00:38:08,337 --> 00:38:10,297
Brian, darling, what is the German word?

481
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,506
l don't remember.

482
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:16,595
-Oh, yes....
-Oh, no.

483
00:38:17,596 --> 00:38:18,597
Bumsen.

484
00:38:24,978 --> 00:38:27,689
lt would be the one German word
you pronounce perfectly.

485
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:30,901
Well, l ought to.
l spent the entire afternoon bumsening...

486
00:38:30,984 --> 00:38:33,320
...like mad with
some ghastly old producer...

487
00:38:33,362 --> 00:38:35,322
...who promised to give me a contract.

488
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,201
Gin, Miss Landauer?

489
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,206
Fritz is overdoing it a bit, isn't he?

490
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:46,875
Natalia's very rich. Fritz is very broke.

491
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:50,212
That old heel-clicking,
hand-kissing routine of his...

492
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,130
...isn't going to get him
anywhere with her.

493
00:38:52,255 --> 00:38:55,467
The only thing to do with virgins
is to make a ferocious pounce.

494
00:38:56,343 --> 00:38:58,845
l can't imagine anyone
pouncing on Natalia.

495
00:38:58,929 --> 00:39:01,223
That's why it would be
so effective, darling.

496
00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:05,519
You are a woman
of many sexual experiences, l think.

497
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:09,523
l'll say, darling. Ever since l was so high,
men have found me irresistible.

498
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:11,817
-Daddy was always worrying that....
-Yes?

499
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:13,110
You know.

500
00:39:13,402 --> 00:39:15,737
How's the gigolo campaign going?

501
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,572
Terrible.

502
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:21,159
This week, already l'm giving up
three dinner invitations...

503
00:39:21,201 --> 00:39:22,828
...to spend 32 marks on her.

504
00:39:23,704 --> 00:39:25,205
That's quite a sacrifice.

505
00:39:25,414 --> 00:39:26,957
And here is the craziness.

506
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:28,333
l like it.

507
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:30,919
Goddammit!

508
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:32,462
What?

509
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:35,173
l think l'm falling in love with her.

510
00:39:35,299 --> 00:39:36,466
l'm so sorry.

511
00:39:36,633 --> 00:39:37,676
So am l.

512
00:39:58,113 --> 00:40:02,451
You assure me the English reader
will find this...

513
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:05,996
...arousing...stimulating?

514
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,165
Well, l....

515
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:12,628
Yes, l...l should think so.

516
00:40:14,296 --> 00:40:15,672
Look, everybody.

517
00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:18,592
Positively a nun's hands, aren't they?

518
00:40:19,635 --> 00:40:22,846
-You look lovely, Sally.
-Just lovely.

519
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:28,352
Thank you. Well, l'm off to the Adlon...

520
00:40:28,852 --> 00:40:30,354
...to see my sexy...

521
00:40:31,104 --> 00:40:33,732
...marvelous, devastating father.

522
00:40:35,275 --> 00:40:38,403
-Auf wiedersehen, my darlings.
-Auf wiedersehen.

523
00:40:39,321 --> 00:40:40,364
Good luck.

524
00:40:44,993 --> 00:40:48,997
l'm terribly sorry, but l couldn't
possibly find any more of them.

525
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:54,711
Good night, and thank you so much
for a delightful evening.

526
00:40:55,003 --> 00:40:56,838
You're most welcome, Herr Roberts.

527
00:40:58,882 --> 00:41:00,342
-Good night.
-Good night.

528
00:41:01,718 --> 00:41:03,553
lt really has been...sublime.

529
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,431
Thank you.

530
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,266
Dearest miss.

531
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,620
You see how she is with me?

532
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:31,748
You see that kiss? You see that kiss?

533
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,209
No, l...l was too discreet to look back.

534
00:41:34,418 --> 00:41:37,004
l think l go...
l go crazy with the frustration.

535
00:41:37,379 --> 00:41:41,758
You know, l...l kiss and inside me
comes the explosion. But her?

536
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:46,013
Brian, l tell you a simple fact...

537
00:41:46,555 --> 00:41:48,640
-...and l'm not boosting.
-''Boasting.''

538
00:41:49,933 --> 00:41:53,270
The French women, the Swedish women,
even the English...

539
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:55,772
...they go wild for my kisses, but...

540
00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:59,192
...this one....

541
00:41:59,276 --> 00:42:00,277
Nothing?

542
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:02,696
Nothing.

543
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:08,535
And l'm a crazy, love-sick fool.

544
00:42:11,163 --> 00:42:12,873
Sally says you ought to pounce.

545
00:42:13,373 --> 00:42:14,333
Pounce?

546
00:42:15,459 --> 00:42:17,252
Throw her on a couch or something.

547
00:42:18,045 --> 00:42:19,338
To attack Natalia?

548
00:42:20,964 --> 00:42:22,174
lmpossible.

549
00:42:23,091 --> 00:42:26,470
Well, Sally is rather knowledgeable
in these areas.

550
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:31,892
You do what Sally says and you end up,
l think, in the prison cell.

551
00:42:37,731 --> 00:42:41,151
-Pounce, huh?
-Pounce.

552
00:43:03,757 --> 00:43:04,883
How'd it go?

553
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,303
Bad?

554
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:11,890
Sally, what is it?

555
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:29,199
l waited at the Adlon till 10:00.

556
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:33,078
When l got back, there was this.

557
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:36,999
''Dear Sally:

558
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:40,294
''Sorry, schedule revised at last minute.

559
00:43:40,335 --> 00:43:42,671
''Writing. Love.''

560
00:43:44,881 --> 00:43:47,009
Well, these...these things do happen.

561
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,178
l'm sure he had a good reason.

562
00:43:51,972 --> 00:43:54,516
Ten words. Exactly.

563
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:58,103
After ten it's extra.

564
00:43:59,438 --> 00:44:01,732
You see, Daddy thinks of these things.

565
00:44:02,316 --> 00:44:04,943
lf l had leprosy, there'd be a cable.

566
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:09,156
''Gee, kid, tough.

567
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:14,328
''Sincerely hope...nose doesn't fall off.

568
00:44:16,622 --> 00:44:17,623
''Love.''

569
00:44:22,836 --> 00:44:23,920
Bastard!

570
00:44:24,463 --> 00:44:26,006
l'll show him!

571
00:44:26,256 --> 00:44:28,634
l'll become a big film star.

572
00:44:37,017 --> 00:44:40,479
The poor man, he tries to love me.

573
00:44:41,647 --> 00:44:43,690
Perhaps he even thinks he does...

574
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,069
...but the real truth...

575
00:44:48,528 --> 00:44:51,573
...is that he just doesn't care.

576
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,161
Maybe he's right.
Maybe l'm not worth caring about.

577
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:04,628
Maybe l am...just nothing. Nothing.

578
00:45:21,395 --> 00:45:23,563
You're a perfectly marvelous girl.

579
00:45:25,399 --> 00:45:26,858
-And beautiful.
-No.

580
00:45:27,442 --> 00:45:29,486
-And talented.
-No, l'm not.

581
00:45:30,737 --> 00:45:32,114
Yes, you are.

582
00:45:40,956 --> 00:45:42,582
Do you really think so?

583
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:44,793
l mean really?

584
00:45:45,419 --> 00:45:46,461
Yes, l do.

585
00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:51,300
Thank you.

586
00:46:43,518 --> 00:46:48,273
''Maybe this time, l'll be lucky

587
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:53,612
''Maybe this time, he'll stay.''

588
00:47:02,746 --> 00:47:05,499
Obviously those three girls...

589
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:08,043
...were just the wrong three girls.

590
00:47:12,756 --> 00:47:17,386
''Maybe this time, for the first time

591
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,057
''Love won't hurry away.''

592
00:47:25,602 --> 00:47:28,021
Doesn't my body
drive you wild with desire?

593
00:47:33,652 --> 00:47:37,322
''He will hold me fast

594
00:47:39,783 --> 00:47:43,453
''l'll be home at last

595
00:47:45,998 --> 00:47:50,419
''Not a loser anymore

596
00:47:50,794 --> 00:47:56,508
''Like the last time
And the time before.

597
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:29,499
''Everybody loves a winner

598
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:34,129
''So nobody loves me.

599
00:48:37,049 --> 00:48:42,012
''Lady peaceful,
Lady happy

600
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:46,141
''That's what l long to be.

601
00:48:48,185 --> 00:48:53,940
''Well, all the odds are
They're in my favor

602
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:58,904
''Something's bound to begin.

603
00:49:00,572 --> 00:49:06,036
''lt's gotta happen,
Happen sometime

604
00:49:06,453 --> 00:49:10,123
''Maybe this time, l'll win.

605
00:49:10,999 --> 00:49:16,838
''Cause everybody, they love a winner

606
00:49:17,714 --> 00:49:20,884
''So nobody loves me.

607
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:28,392
''Lady peaceful,
Lady happy

608
00:49:29,393 --> 00:49:32,312
''That's what l long to be.

00:49:34,106 --> 00:49:39,528

00:49:40,112 --> 00:49:43,240

''Maybe this time, l'll win.''

614
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,926
Hey, what's going on?

615
00:50:48,722 --> 00:50:51,308
Tell him your lover
is a gangster from Chicago.

616
00:51:12,746 --> 00:51:14,748
-You told him?
-l did better than that.

617
00:51:15,207 --> 00:51:18,335
l just told him that l had
the teeniest touch of syphilis.

618
00:51:24,007 --> 00:51:26,843
Wait till he gets a load
of what little old Elke's got.

619
00:51:32,766 --> 00:51:34,226
-Landauer?
-Ja.

620
00:51:40,899 --> 00:51:43,527
l am grateful to you
that you came to me from my call.

621
00:51:43,652 --> 00:51:45,362
Don't be silly. l'm all agog.

622
00:51:47,114 --> 00:51:48,240
Thank you.

623
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:54,955
-You will eat food, please?
-Thank you.

624
00:52:04,464 --> 00:52:06,466
-You see, Fraulein....
-Sally.

625
00:52:09,678 --> 00:52:13,223
Our acquaintance is not long,
but l am choosing you...

626
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:15,642
...because l know
no other young woman...

627
00:52:15,684 --> 00:52:17,769
...who is giving her body
frequently to men.

628
00:52:20,397 --> 00:52:21,690
My English.

629
00:52:22,107 --> 00:52:23,859
l am rending you an embarrassment?

630
00:52:24,151 --> 00:52:25,902
No, no, l'm fascinated.

631
00:52:29,156 --> 00:52:30,907
Fritz Wendel has declared love for me.

632
00:52:32,659 --> 00:52:34,995
At first l not taking this seriously.

633
00:52:36,163 --> 00:52:37,205
He is so...

634
00:52:39,124 --> 00:52:42,711
...so formal. And also l think so much...

635
00:52:42,961 --> 00:52:45,964
...the gigolo who hunts for the fortune.

636
00:52:47,924 --> 00:52:49,217
ls that what you say?

637
00:52:49,676 --> 00:52:51,303
That's what we say, all right.

638
00:52:52,262 --> 00:52:53,305
Then...

639
00:52:54,264 --> 00:52:55,891
...the night before yesterday...

640
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:59,227
...my parents are from the house...

641
00:52:59,936 --> 00:53:01,647
...und we are seated here...

642
00:53:02,481 --> 00:53:04,274
...upon my father's library sofa.

643
00:53:05,942 --> 00:53:07,069
Suddenly...

644
00:53:07,778 --> 00:53:09,655
...he throws aside the formalities...

645
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,532
-...there is fire, there is passion.
-Oh, my God...

646
00:53:13,992 --> 00:53:15,744
-...he pounced!
-Please?

647
00:53:19,581 --> 00:53:20,874
He made love to you.

648
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:22,960
On my father's library sofa.

649
00:53:23,919 --> 00:53:26,213
Und even for that
he is showing no respect.

650
00:53:26,922 --> 00:53:29,841
l am fighting,
l'm calling out harsh words...

651
00:53:30,717 --> 00:53:31,760
...but then....

652
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,972
May we not be frank?

653
00:53:36,848 --> 00:53:37,933
Suddenly...

654
00:53:39,893 --> 00:53:41,937
...all is...equal fire...

655
00:53:44,022 --> 00:53:45,399
...equal passion in me.

656
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,861
And since then, l think only of him.

657
00:53:51,613 --> 00:53:53,782
Now, is this love...

658
00:53:55,242 --> 00:53:56,868
...or mere fatuation of the body?

659
00:53:58,912 --> 00:54:01,248
You with so many, as you call,
''screwings''...

660
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,167
...shall please tell me the truth of it.

661
00:54:13,844 --> 00:54:14,928
Please.

662
00:54:17,723 --> 00:54:19,725
Does it really matter,
as long as you're having fun?

663
00:54:20,183 --> 00:54:21,601
How can you speak of ''fun''?

664
00:54:22,436 --> 00:54:23,895
He has asked me to marry him.

665
00:54:24,354 --> 00:54:26,648
Well, that's wonderful. Why don't you?

666
00:54:27,357 --> 00:54:31,820
And say to my father that l am marrying
a man who is perhaps a fortune hunter?

667
00:54:33,614 --> 00:54:34,781
And a Christian, too.

668
00:54:36,617 --> 00:54:38,994
Oh, this l think is...breaking his heart.

669
00:54:39,995 --> 00:54:43,957
Well, in that case then, l guess
you better just forget the whole thing.

670
00:54:45,292 --> 00:54:46,293
Forget Fritz?

671
00:54:47,669 --> 00:54:49,212
How am l ever forgetting Fritz?

672
00:54:49,379 --> 00:54:51,506
Look, l really have to be running along.

673
00:54:55,385 --> 00:54:56,553
Don't cry.

674
00:54:57,554 --> 00:54:59,431
Oh, please, don't cry.

675
00:55:01,016 --> 00:55:03,518
l'm no good at all if anybody cries.

676
00:55:07,481 --> 00:55:09,107
Natalia, about Fritz pouncing...

677
00:55:10,984 --> 00:55:12,486
...you see, l thought....

678
00:55:16,198 --> 00:55:17,407
l didn't think....

679
00:55:19,618 --> 00:55:22,079
How shall so grave a problem
resolve itself?

680
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:25,540
Poor thing.

681
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:29,002
You can't marry him.
You can't give him up.

682
00:55:31,213 --> 00:55:34,841
l don't suppose you'd ever consider
seeing him on the sly, every now....

683
00:55:35,634 --> 00:55:37,219
No, l didn't think so.

684
00:55:39,262 --> 00:55:43,433
My God, it's enough
to drive a girl into a convent.

685
00:55:46,019 --> 00:55:47,312
Do they have Jewish nuns?

686
00:56:01,368 --> 00:56:03,453
-Good day.
-Good day.

687
00:56:05,956 --> 00:56:08,625
Please...can you wash...?

688
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:11,003
-Excuse me, miss, l think you lost this.
-What?

689
00:56:12,379 --> 00:56:16,008
-l think you dropped this.
-Yes, thank you.

690
00:56:16,842 --> 00:56:19,636
Can you wash my clothes...

691
00:56:20,554 --> 00:56:22,431
...Monday, Tuesday?

692
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,516
l'm sorry, l don't understand you.

693
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:26,101
Excuse me, may l help you?

694
00:56:26,143 --> 00:56:29,062
l want my laundry back by Tuesday.

695
00:56:30,314 --> 00:56:33,358
The young lady would like
her laundry back by Tuesday.

696
00:56:33,692 --> 00:56:34,860
l understand.

697
00:56:34,943 --> 00:56:35,986
lt's okay.

698
00:56:37,821 --> 00:56:39,197
Thank you so much.

699
00:56:39,573 --> 00:56:41,074
Maximilian von Heune.

700
00:56:42,242 --> 00:56:43,410
Sally Bowles.

701
00:56:46,204 --> 00:56:49,082
Do you have a cigarette?
l'm absolutely desperate.

702
00:56:49,499 --> 00:56:51,501
l must have left mine at the club.

703
00:56:52,252 --> 00:56:53,587
The Kit Kat Klub.

704
00:56:55,672 --> 00:56:57,007
Divine decadence.

705
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:02,512
May l drop you somewhere?
l have my car outside.

706
00:57:03,013 --> 00:57:04,097
All right.

707
00:57:04,431 --> 00:57:06,850
-Auf wiedersehen.
-Auf wiedersehen, darling.

708
00:57:12,773 --> 00:57:13,774
Money.

709
00:57:14,566 --> 00:57:15,692

-Three thirty.

-We didn't stop laughing.
-Don't open your eyes.

788
01:03:36,448 --> 01:03:41,244
Bri, why didn't you come?
We had the best time, and so much fun.

789
01:03:43,038 --> 01:03:45,874
-Max really knows how to corrupt a girl.
-l try.

You call it funny.
l think it's divine. l love it.

793
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:01,598
Oh, God, we didn't get anything for Brian.

794
01:04:06,937 --> 01:04:09,356
l'm afraid l had no time
to have it wrapped.

795
01:04:10,732 --> 01:04:12,901
Darling, isn't that beautiful?

796
01:04:14,444 --> 01:04:16,905
What on earth makes you think
l'd accept that?

797
01:04:17,572 --> 01:04:20,492
-To give me pleasure.
-Max loves buying things.

798
01:04:24,288 --> 01:04:26,665
Brian, you're a man of strong convictions.

799
01:04:27,624 --> 01:04:29,334
Can we have caviar again?

800
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:31,628
But, you had it for breakfast.

801
01:04:32,754 --> 01:04:34,506
Can l have it for lunch?

802
01:04:34,756 --> 01:04:37,968

Anything you want.

805

Oh, you should have been there.

806
01:05:08,081 --> 01:05:12,169
The Nazis are just a gang of stupid
hooligans, but they do serve a purpose.

807
01:05:12,461 --> 01:05:16,214
Let them get rid of the Communists.
Later we'll be able to control them.

808

-But who exactly is ''we''?
-Germany, of course.

810
01:05:24,431 --> 01:05:26,058
-Why not?
-Oh, wonderful.

811
01:05:26,141 --> 01:05:27,768
l'm dying to show off my new coat.

812
01:05:27,976 --> 01:05:29,519

813
01:05:29,603 --> 01:05:32,481
Good. We'll make a night of it.
Or, why not a weekend?

814
01:05:35,776 --> 01:05:39,321

these days.

01:11:36,845 --> 01:11:39,723
Oh, it's excellent, excellent.
But the food here is always good.

882
01:11:40,265 --> 01:11:43,685
Excuse me, but didn't we meet
with Emil Jannings at UFA last winter?

883
01:11:43,977 --> 01:11:44,811
l don't--

884
01:11:44,853 --> 01:11:46,480
You do know Emil, don't you?

885
01:11:46,563 --> 01:11:48,690
l find him trés amusant.

886
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,368
Money.

887
01:12:00,452 --> 01:12:01,578
Be careful!

888
01:12:03,288 --> 01:12:04,331
Clara Bow.

889
01:12:04,748 --> 01:12:07,459
-That's not Clara Bow.
-lt's early Clara Bow.

890
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,797
Wait, l got one. l got one.

891
01:12:14,675 --> 01:12:16,218
Late Sally Bowles.

892
01:12:16,843 --> 01:12:17,970
Yes, it is.

893
01:12:18,762 --> 01:12:20,347
You two are marvelous.

894
01:12:21,014 --> 01:12:22,975
Have you ever been to Africa?

895
01:12:23,767 --> 01:12:25,686
-Where, mein Schatz?
-Africa.

896
01:12:26,561 --> 01:12:29,106
Let's go, the three of us.
Smile Brian.

897
01:12:37,322 --> 01:12:39,783
-Sally, you're really talented.
-What?

898
01:12:40,909 --> 01:12:42,286
You're talented.

899
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:48,667
He wants to take us to Africa.

900
01:12:53,213 --> 01:12:54,715
He must be insane.

901
01:12:57,050 --> 01:13:00,512
More! Come on, please. More!
More, more, more! Please!

902
01:13:00,679 --> 01:13:01,722
-That's all.
-More!

903
01:13:01,805 --> 01:13:02,931
More, please!

904
01:13:03,015 --> 01:13:04,182
More!

905
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,274
-Come on, Max.
-No, no. No.

906
01:13:12,733 --> 01:13:13,984
Oh, please?

907
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:17,112
Oh, bravo, bravo.

908
01:13:45,849 --> 01:13:47,434
The king of the jungle.

909
01:15:12,269 --> 01:15:14,104
What's the matter? You all right?

910
01:15:20,944 --> 01:15:22,070
You okay?

911
01:16:12,746 --> 01:16:14,873
Mombasa's quite wonderful, really.

912
01:16:14,998 --> 01:16:17,417
l mean, the way ports are
all over the world.

913
01:16:17,876 --> 01:16:19,378
Sounds absolutely exotic.

914
01:16:20,379 --> 01:16:22,547
All the way through Tanganyika.

915
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:24,174
Sure?

916
01:16:25,092 --> 01:16:26,426
Sally, champagne?

917
01:16:32,975 --> 01:16:35,978
Every now and then the train stops
in the middle of nowhere...

918
01:16:36,061 --> 01:16:39,481
...and right there is a family of giraffes,
nibbling the trees...

919
01:16:39,773 --> 01:16:42,734
...or a herd of zebra,
galloping off in a cloud of dust.

920
01:16:43,527 --> 01:16:46,655
And when the flamingos come in,
thousands and thousands of them...

921
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:48,991
...turning the whole sky pink....

922
01:16:49,074 --> 01:16:50,867
You'll be amazed when you see it.

923
01:16:53,078 --> 01:16:54,705
Hey! Hey, Sally.

924
01:16:56,039 --> 01:16:57,833
Are you quite comfortable?

925
01:17:02,045 --> 01:17:03,046
Come on.

926
01:17:27,738 --> 01:17:29,364
Sally is an endearing child.

927
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:33,035
But l must admit l find it peaceful
when she's taking her nap.

928
01:18:03,607 --> 01:18:04,650
To Africa.

929
01:18:07,903 --> 01:18:08,904
To Africa.

930
01:18:14,534 --> 01:18:20,958
''The sun on the meadow
ls summery warm

931
01:18:21,625 --> 01:18:26,129

Do you still think you can control them?

Natalia.

956
01:21:30,564 --> 01:21:32,733
Fritz, you frightened me.

957
01:21:33,025 --> 01:21:35,027
l'm sorry, but l must speak to you.

958
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:38,947
No, go away. Please go away.
l told you not to come.

959
01:21:39,114 --> 01:21:40,449
Natalia, please.

960
01:21:40,949 --> 01:21:42,993
The situation is impossible.

961
01:21:43,368 --> 01:21:45,495
We must not see each other anymore.

962
01:21:45,579 --> 01:21:47,289
ls it the money? ls it that?

963
01:21:59,384 --> 01:22:01,970
l did think it was the money, at first.

964
01:22:02,387 --> 01:22:03,513
But not now.

965
01:22:04,264 --> 01:22:07,517
Now l know that you love me.
l know you are an honest man...

966
01:22:07,643 --> 01:22:09,269
...who would never lie to me.

967
01:22:11,104 --> 01:22:14,650
Natalia, l beg of you, marry me.

968
01:22:19,154 --> 01:22:20,238
l can't.

969
01:22:22,658 --> 01:22:24,826
ls it your parents? lsn't it?

970
01:22:25,243 --> 01:22:27,663
lt's not my parents. lt is me.

971
01:22:27,913 --> 01:22:29,081
lt is you, too.

972
01:22:33,794 --> 01:22:35,295
Fritz, be careful!

973
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:38,632
What am l doing?

974
01:22:39,883 --> 01:22:42,594
l've never jumped
on a running board before.

975
01:22:42,803 --> 01:22:44,096
Are you all right?

976
01:22:47,724 --> 01:22:48,892
Why won't you marry me?

977
01:22:51,812 --> 01:22:54,398
Don't you see what is happening
in Germany today?

978
01:22:55,023 --> 01:22:56,316
l'm a Jew.

979
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:58,026
You are not.

980
01:23:01,613 --> 01:23:02,864
Goodbye, dear Fritz.

981
01:23:58,337 --> 01:23:59,463
You, drive.

982
01:23:59,588 --> 01:24:01,089
There is somebody in the way, sir.

983
01:24:01,173 --> 01:24:02,716
Just drive on, idiot!

984
01:24:07,971 --> 01:24:11,516
l told Schneider we'd be gone
for at least two months, maybe more.

985
01:24:11,767 --> 01:24:14,227
She cried and cried
and said she'd miss us.

986
01:24:14,686 --> 01:24:16,980
l think the only reason she was crying,
though, was because she knew...

987
01:24:17,022 --> 01:24:19,274
...she can't get 50 marks a month
from anybody else...

988
01:24:19,524 --> 01:24:20,901
...for this pitiful little room.

989
01:24:20,984 --> 01:24:23,487
You know:
''Money makes the world go around.''

990
01:24:24,696 --> 01:24:27,908
Where've you been?
l've been packing for hours.

991
01:24:29,159 --> 01:24:32,120
Have some champagne, darling.
Compliments of Max.

992
01:24:33,747 --> 01:24:36,375
Oh, your laundry came back.
lt's there on the bed.

993
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:40,712
You know Bri, it occurred to me....

994
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:44,007
l know l've handled Max brilliantly....

995
01:24:44,466 --> 01:24:46,593
Enough of the African moon.

996
01:24:47,135 --> 01:24:49,388
l mean, it would be funny, wouldn't it,
if he asked me to become...

997
01:24:49,471 --> 01:24:52,140
...the next Baroness von Heune
und Regensburg?

998
01:24:54,268 --> 01:24:58,188
l've been looking for that for months.
l mean, stranger things have happened.

999
01:25:01,108 --> 01:25:03,527
l wouldn't dream of accepting him,
of course.

1000
01:25:04,236 --> 01:25:07,531
For God's sake,
l wish you could hear yourself sometimes.

1001
01:25:08,073 --> 01:25:09,992
l mean, really hear yourself!

1002
01:25:11,368 --> 01:25:12,369
Christ!

1003
01:25:17,124 --> 01:25:19,960
Aren't you ever gonna stop
deluding yourself?

1004
01:25:20,711 --> 01:25:22,004
''Handling Max!''

1005
01:25:22,754 --> 01:25:26,550
Behaving like some ludicrous, little,
underage femme fatale!

1006
01:25:27,301 --> 01:25:30,804
You're about as ''fatale''
as an after-dinner mint.

1007
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:42,024
Darling, we all know...

1008
01:25:42,566 --> 01:25:45,527
...about your vast experiences
with les femmes...

1009
01:25:46,153 --> 01:25:47,446
...fatales, or otherwise.

1010
01:25:50,616 --> 01:25:52,534
Why don't you just come out with it?

1011
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:57,331
You can't stand Maximilian
because he's everything you're not!

1012
01:25:58,999 --> 01:26:02,544
He doesn't have to give English lessons
for three marks an hour.

1013
01:26:02,669 --> 01:26:03,795
He's rich!

1014
01:26:04,087 --> 01:26:07,341
And he knows about life.
He doesn't read about it in books!

1015
01:26:08,216 --> 01:26:09,635
He's suave...

1016
01:26:10,385 --> 01:26:12,346
...and he's divinely sexy...

1017
01:26:13,847 --> 01:26:16,725
...and he really appreciates a woman.

1018
01:26:17,059 --> 01:26:19,311
Oh, screw Maximilian!

1019
01:26:20,854 --> 01:26:21,855
l do.

1020
01:26:32,616 --> 01:26:33,575
So do l.

1021
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:55,430
You two bastards!

1022
01:26:58,809 --> 01:26:59,810
Two?

1023
01:27:00,978 --> 01:27:02,062
Two?!

1024
01:27:02,896 --> 01:27:04,690
Shouldn't that be three?

1025
01:27:20,998 --> 01:27:22,582
Help us with our order....

1026
01:27:22,958 --> 01:27:26,211
l think your paper and your party
are pure crap, sir!

1027
01:27:26,795 --> 01:27:27,796
What did you say?

1028
01:27:28,255 --> 01:27:30,590
l said: That's a lot of crap!

1029
01:27:31,133 --> 01:27:32,467
And so are you!

1030
01:27:32,926 --> 01:27:34,803
He's a foreigner.

1031
01:27:52,738 --> 01:27:55,907
l hear you took on
the entire Nazi party single-handed.

1032
01:27:58,827 --> 01:27:59,870
Only two?

1033
01:28:05,876 --> 01:28:07,586
Sounds like...cigarette?

1034
01:28:13,175 --> 01:28:14,676
Feel up to a little surprise?

1035
01:28:25,395 --> 01:28:27,022
Poor thing, you're blind.

1036
01:28:29,816 --> 01:28:32,861
''Dear Sally and Bri....''
ln that order, please note.

1037
01:28:36,114 --> 01:28:39,576
''l know you will forgive me,
but family affairs make it imperative...

1038
01:28:39,701 --> 01:28:41,662
''...for me to leave
for Argentina, immediately.

1039
01:28:41,870 --> 01:28:43,538
''lt was fun, wasn't it?''

01:28:44,998 --> 01:28:46,583
Signed: ''Maximilian.''

1041
01:28:47,584 --> 01:28:49,086
Argentina, my ass.

1042
01:28:50,879 --> 01:28:52,339
He also sent this.

1043
01:28:53,006 --> 01:28:54,466
Three hundred marks.

1044
01:28:54,758 --> 01:28:56,176
For the two of us.

1045
01:28:57,886 --> 01:28:59,554
A hundred and fifty each.

1046
01:29:03,558 --> 01:29:05,936
Let's see, on an hour-to-hour basis...

1047
01:29:06,103 --> 01:29:08,730
...that puts us on a par with Fraulein Kost.

1048
01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:13,735
Some gold diggers, aren't we?

1049
01:29:19,992 --> 01:29:21,618
Oh, Brian, l'm so sorry.

1050
01:31:11,812 --> 01:31:14,356
Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew.

1051
01:31:14,564 --> 01:31:16,900
Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew.

1052
01:32:20,213 --> 01:32:21,673
Anything the matter?

1053
01:32:26,511 --> 01:32:28,388
What is it? What's happened?

1054
01:32:29,389 --> 01:32:32,434
Goddammit, l'm gonna have a baby!

1055
01:32:36,438 --> 01:32:38,190
Well, aren't you gonna ask?

1056
01:32:38,523 --> 01:32:39,650
All right.

1057
01:32:40,275 --> 01:32:42,027
-Whose is it?
-l don't know.

1058
01:32:44,988 --> 01:32:46,490
l really don't know.

1059
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:49,910
-What are you going to do?
-Obviously, l can't have it.

1060
01:32:51,495 --> 01:32:53,330
The doctor l went to said he'll do it.

1061
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:56,833
But it's expensive. He has to...

1062
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,544
...bribe somebody or other
for some kind of...

1063
01:32:59,628 --> 01:33:02,255
...a certificate or something.
Oh, l don't know.

1064
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:04,883
Well...

1065
01:33:04,967 --> 01:33:06,551
...there goes my fur coat.

1066
01:33:53,932 --> 01:33:55,642
l would like to marry you.

1067
01:34:01,064 --> 01:34:03,775
-Okay, a touch of toothpaste.
-Naturally.

1068
01:34:04,109 --> 01:34:05,319
A lot of gin.

1069
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,238
All whooshed up together.

1070
01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:13,410
With this spiked prairie oyster,
l thee wed.

1071
01:34:14,077 --> 01:34:15,412
To the future.

1072
01:34:17,623 --> 01:34:19,916
With any luck,
l'll get a fellowship at King's.

1073
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,710
Oh, dear, what's that?

1074
01:34:22,127 --> 01:34:23,795
My college at Cambridge.

1075
01:34:24,171 --> 01:34:27,007
-You'll absolutely love it there.
-l know l will.

1076
01:34:31,136 --> 01:34:33,055
-lt's crazy.
-Who?

1077
01:34:34,264 --> 01:34:37,225
Me. Wanting to be an actress.

1078
01:34:44,149 --> 01:34:46,985
l guess babies love you automatically,
don't they?

1079
01:34:49,988 --> 01:34:52,199
They don't have much of a choice.

1080
01:34:58,038 --> 01:35:00,666
-To you and the baby.
-To me and the baby.

1081
01:35:06,838 --> 01:35:08,298
Probably is yours.

1082
01:35:10,258 --> 01:35:12,135
But l don't suppose
we'll ever know for sure.

1083
01:35:15,264 --> 01:35:16,223
So what?

1084
01:35:19,643 --> 01:35:21,395
You sure you don't mind?

1085
01:35:23,230 --> 01:35:24,231
Honestly?

1086
01:35:25,023 --> 01:35:26,024
Honestly.

1087
01:35:30,404 --> 01:35:31,571
Oh, Bri....

1088
01:35:33,156 --> 01:35:35,575
-To me and the baby.
-To you and the baby.

1089
01:35:40,372 --> 01:35:41,790
To you. You.

1090
01:35:41,957 --> 01:35:43,292
Me? To me.

1091
01:35:44,751 --> 01:35:46,211
And the baby.

1092
01:35:51,258 --> 01:35:53,844
-Oh, where are you going?
-l'll be right back.

1093
01:35:57,723 --> 01:36:01,768
You are a most strange
and extraordinary person.

1094
01:36:01,893 --> 01:36:03,145
l know, l know.

1095
01:36:11,111 --> 01:36:12,446
The proud father.

1096
01:37:10,128 --> 01:37:13,840
Good lord, Fritz.
You're on time. l can't believe it.

1097
01:37:15,634 --> 01:37:16,843
How's Natalia?

1098
01:37:17,010 --> 01:37:19,388
Please, l do not speak of Natalia.

1099
01:37:20,430 --> 01:37:21,515
As bad as that?

1100
01:37:21,890 --> 01:37:22,849
Bad.

1101
01:37:23,433 --> 01:37:25,560
Perhaps l cut myself at the throat.

1102
01:37:25,769 --> 01:37:27,896
Prepositions, Fritz, prepositions.

1103
01:37:28,230 --> 01:37:29,564
''ln the throat?''

1104
01:37:29,731 --> 01:37:31,441
No, just ''cut my throat.''

1105
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:42,452
lf all the Jews are bankers,
then how can they be Communists, too?

1106
01:37:43,328 --> 01:37:44,454
Subtle...

1107
01:37:44,496 --> 01:37:46,331
...very subtle, Fraulein Kost.

1108
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,459
lf they can't destroy us one way...

1109
01:37:52,170 --> 01:37:53,797
...they try the other.

1110
01:37:55,173 --> 01:37:57,384
You don't really believe that, do you?

1111
01:37:57,551 --> 01:38:00,554
But you read it every day
in the Volkischer Beobachter.

1112
01:38:01,888 --> 01:38:04,224
That ridiculous Nazi tripe!

1113
01:38:04,683 --> 01:38:07,519
lt is an established fact, Herr Roberts...

1114
01:38:08,312 --> 01:38:12,858
...that there exists a well-organized
international conspiracy...

1115
01:38:13,275 --> 01:38:16,653
...of Jewish bankers and Communists.

1116
01:38:18,572 --> 01:38:21,241
lt's also an established fact,
that there exists...

1117
01:38:21,325 --> 01:38:24,953
...another well-organized group,
of which you're obviously a member.

1118
01:38:25,245 --> 01:38:28,332
The lnternational Conspiracy
of Horses' Asses.

1119
01:38:33,378 --> 01:38:35,172
l wish the Kaiser was back.

1120
01:38:36,048 --> 01:38:37,841
ln those days we had order.

1121
01:38:39,051 --> 01:38:42,638
l expect Schneider will raise my rent
after that little exhibition.

1122
01:38:43,513 --> 01:38:45,182
Oh, well, what the hell.

1123
01:38:47,059 --> 01:38:48,810
Let's get on with these prepositions.

1124
01:38:48,894 --> 01:38:51,396
What a black day l'm meeting that girl!

1125
01:38:53,523 --> 01:38:55,275
l...l thought you loved her.

1126
01:38:55,776 --> 01:38:58,195
Love, love,
who's needing verdammtes love?

1127
01:39:00,405 --> 01:39:02,407
You want to hear the big joke on me?

1128
01:39:02,616 --> 01:39:04,117
You want to hear it?

1129
01:39:06,411 --> 01:39:07,871
l am a Jew.

1130
01:39:09,206 --> 01:39:10,248
So?

1131
01:39:10,666 --> 01:39:12,376
To be a Jew in Germany?

1132
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:15,337
Only a fool is this, l think.

1133
01:39:16,004 --> 01:39:16,964
So...

1134
01:39:17,255 --> 01:39:19,883
...l come to Berlin and l'm not a Jew.

1135
01:39:21,385 --> 01:39:22,636
How did you manage that?

1136
01:39:23,387 --> 01:39:25,847
Where it says on my papers ''religion''...

1137
01:39:26,473 --> 01:39:29,142
...l am writing...''Protestant.''

1138
01:39:29,893 --> 01:39:31,895
So, the work comes.

1139
01:39:33,021 --> 01:39:34,356
The friends come.

1140
01:39:35,315 --> 01:39:36,650
The parties come.

1141
01:39:37,734 --> 01:39:38,694
Parties.

1142
01:39:41,113 --> 01:39:44,408
Whoever dreams
that l shall fall in love with a Jewish girl?

1143
01:39:44,825 --> 01:39:47,035
But surely that solves your problem.

1144
01:39:47,661 --> 01:39:50,706
-All you've got to do is tell her--
-Do you understand nothing?

1145
01:39:50,789 --> 01:39:51,832
This girl!

1146
01:39:54,918 --> 01:39:57,504
Do you know what she has done to me?

1147
01:39:58,338 --> 01:39:59,548
lt's terrible!

1148
01:40:02,092 --> 01:40:04,803
She has turned me into an honest man.

1149
01:40:06,305 --> 01:40:08,098
''Oh, you're good,'' she says.

1150
01:40:08,265 --> 01:40:11,351
''A man of integrity,
who will never lie to me.''

1151
01:40:16,064 --> 01:40:18,442
What does she do if l tell her now?

1152
01:40:19,484 --> 01:40:22,070
l tell you what she does,
if l tell her now.

1153
01:40:22,154 --> 01:40:24,197
She kicks me out into the streets.

1154
01:40:25,532 --> 01:40:28,493
Don't be silly! She'd understand.

1155
01:40:30,662 --> 01:40:32,372
Anyway, what have you got to lose?

1156
01:40:32,623 --> 01:40:36,251
What do l lose?
She kicks me out into the streets.

1157
01:40:36,501 --> 01:40:39,838
All my friends hear l'm a Jew,
they kick me out into the streets.

1158
01:40:39,921 --> 01:40:44,092
And then, l think, comes a big Nazi
with a club and bangs me on the head.

1159
01:40:47,971 --> 01:40:50,599
Fritz, l really think
you're underestimating Natalia.

1160
01:40:55,562 --> 01:40:56,897
What am l doing?

1161
01:40:58,065 --> 01:40:59,566
l don't like whiskey.

1162
01:41:00,567 --> 01:41:02,027
Look, just tell her.

1163
01:41:02,611 --> 01:41:04,446
No, l can't, l can't.

1164
01:41:05,989 --> 01:41:07,783
What a coward am l.

1165
01:41:24,132 --> 01:41:25,926
''l know what you're thinking.

1166
01:41:26,885 --> 01:41:28,971
''You wonder why l chose her

1167
01:41:29,638 --> 01:41:32,975
''Out of all the ladies in the world.

1168
01:41:34,935 --> 01:41:37,354
''lt's just a first impression.

1169
01:41:37,896 --> 01:41:40,482
''What good's a first impression?

1170
01:41:41,441 --> 01:41:45,946
''lf you knew her like l do

1171
01:41:47,614 --> 01:41:53,453
''lt would change your point of view.

1172
01:42:05,257 --> 01:42:08,719
''lf you could see her through my eyes

1173
01:42:09,386 --> 01:42:12,764
''You wouldn't wonder at all.

1174
01:42:13,390 --> 01:42:16,852
''lf you could see her through my eyes

1175
01:42:17,436 --> 01:42:21,356
''l guarantee you would fall like l did.

1176
01:42:21,523 --> 01:42:24,484
''When we're in public together

1177
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:28,739
''l hear society moan

1178
01:42:29,406 --> 01:42:33,035
''But if they could see her through my eyes

1179
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:36,622
''Maybe they'd leave us alone.

1180
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:46,840
''How can l speak of her virtues

1181
01:42:47,799 --> 01:42:50,761
''l don't know where to begin.

1182
01:42:51,595 --> 01:42:53,555
''She's clever,
She's smart

01:42:53,847 --> 01:42:55,182
''She reads music.

1184
01:42:55,766 --> 01:42:59,645
''She doesn't smoke or drink gin like l do

1185

''Yet when we're walking together

1186
01:43:03,774 --> 01:43:07,027

01:43:12,074 --> 01:43:14,910
''Maybe they'd all understand.

''Why don't they leave us alone?''

Meine Damen und Herren,
mesdames et messieurs...

1191
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,718
...ladies und gentlemen...

1192
01:44:13,176 --> 01:44:14,428
...l ask you...

1193
01:44:14,511 --> 01:44:16,972
...is it a crime to fall in love?

1194
01:44:18,223 --> 01:44:22,019
Can one ever choose
where the heart leads us?

1195
01:44:23,186 --> 01:44:26,315
All we ask is that you understand.

1196
01:44:27,482 --> 01:44:29,067
A little understanding.

1197
01:44:29,318 --> 01:44:33,322
Why can't the world live and let live?

1198
01:44:34,448 --> 01:44:37,909
Live und let live.

1199
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:42,497
''Oh, l understand your objection

1200
01:44:42,998 --> 01:44:46,168
''l grant you the problem's not small

l'm a Jew.

1205
01:46:50,125 --> 01:46:51,710
Brian, anything wrong?

1206
01:46:54,671 --> 01:46:56,089
Lazy that's all.

1207
01:46:56,673 --> 01:46:57,966
That's all?

1208
01:46:58,842 --> 01:46:59,968
That's all.

1209
01:47:16,234 --> 01:47:17,611
Look what l found.

1210
01:47:19,655 --> 01:47:20,656
See?

1211
01:47:21,949 --> 01:47:23,283
We must be lucky.

1212
01:47:35,379 --> 01:47:38,257
Will you still love me
when l'm blown up like a balloon?

1213
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:40,676
Will my body drive you
wild with desire?

1214
01:47:47,975 --> 01:47:49,434
Sure. Why not?

1215
01:47:55,232 --> 01:47:58,652
Oh, Bri, it's fantastic, isn't it?
Just think:

1216
01:47:58,986 --> 01:48:00,904
Your life and my life...

1217
01:48:01,905 --> 01:48:04,700
...solved in one fell swoop.
And all by the baby!

1218
01:48:06,827 --> 01:48:10,998
l guess it's just about the most significant
baby the world has ever known...

1219
01:48:11,665 --> 01:48:13,166
...since Jesus.

1220
01:48:17,212 --> 01:48:20,507
lt'll be a most strange
and extraordinary baby, won't it?

1221
01:49:59,523 --> 01:50:01,108
Good morning, darling.

1222
01:50:07,447 --> 01:50:10,575
Darling, would you mind seeing
if there's a bit of brandy left?

1223
01:50:11,451 --> 01:50:13,745
Put an egg in it,
and we'll call it breakfast.

1224
01:50:17,833 --> 01:50:20,377
l suppose you wonder
what on earth happened to me?

1225
01:50:21,545 --> 01:50:23,964
l'm afraid we made a night of it.

1226
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:43,483
Where's your fur coat?

1227
01:50:48,488 --> 01:50:50,073
You did it, didn't you?

1228
01:50:51,408 --> 01:50:52,743
Did what, darling?

1229
01:50:53,702 --> 01:50:54,911
The abortion.

1230
01:51:02,919 --> 01:51:04,254
ln God's name...

1231
01:51:06,214 --> 01:51:07,215
...why?

1232
01:51:11,261 --> 01:51:12,596
One of my whims?

1233
01:51:17,434 --> 01:51:19,269
ls that all you can say?

1234
01:51:20,312 --> 01:51:21,730
''One of my whims?''

1235
01:51:23,023 --> 01:51:24,107
What right...?

1236
01:51:24,191 --> 01:51:27,402
lf you wanna hit me,
why don't you just hit me?

1237
01:51:36,620 --> 01:51:37,955
But you wanted it.

1238
01:51:40,248 --> 01:51:41,375
Didn't you?

1239
01:51:48,590 --> 01:51:49,925
Me and the baby.

1240
01:51:52,970 --> 01:51:56,181
l suppose Max Reinhardt
did show up at the club.

1241
01:51:56,390 --> 01:51:59,184
Or was it a friend of a friend
of a friend of...

1242
01:51:59,434 --> 01:52:03,772
...an assistant director who said he'd
try to squeeze you into the chorus line?

1243
01:52:03,981 --> 01:52:06,024
That is, of course, if you...

1244
01:52:06,775 --> 01:52:08,151
...if you went to bed with him.

1245
01:52:11,446 --> 01:52:13,365
-You think that?
-Yes.

1246
01:52:18,036 --> 01:52:19,871
Well then, it's just as well, isn't it?

1247
01:52:20,247 --> 01:52:22,124
For you, for everyone.

1248
01:52:24,334 --> 01:52:28,088
And, darling, would you be an angel
and just let me get some sleep?

1249
01:52:39,057 --> 01:52:40,642
Tell me why you did it.

1250
01:52:45,188 --> 01:52:47,983
What is there to say?
You've said it all in one way or another.

1251
01:52:49,151 --> 01:52:50,402
Sally, please.

1252
01:52:52,487 --> 01:52:53,739
l have to know.

1253
01:52:56,533 --> 01:52:57,534
Okay.

1254
01:53:02,581 --> 01:53:05,042
l'm self-centered, inconsiderate...

1255
01:53:08,003 --> 01:53:09,796
...and what was the third adjective?

1256
01:53:10,130 --> 01:53:11,173
Oh, yes.

1257
01:53:11,465 --> 01:53:14,176
And l have this infantile fantasy...

1258
01:53:14,718 --> 01:53:18,180
...that one day l'll amount
to something as an actress.

1259
01:53:22,643 --> 01:53:25,187
A dinky little cottage in Cambridge?

1260
01:53:26,021 --> 01:53:29,358
A playpen in the bedroom,
diapers on the towel rack....

1261
01:53:31,735 --> 01:53:35,322
How soon would it be
before we started hating each other?

1262
01:53:37,074 --> 01:53:40,327
How soon would it be before
l started dashing out...

1263
01:53:40,619 --> 01:53:43,830
...disgracing myself at some nearest pub?

1264
01:53:44,957 --> 01:53:47,084
And how soon would it be before...?

1265
01:53:52,297 --> 01:53:53,382
Before?

1266
01:53:56,635 --> 01:53:57,886
Say it.

1267
01:53:59,137 --> 01:54:00,180
Go on!

1268
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:02,432
You might as well, now.

1269
01:54:02,933 --> 01:54:04,142
Forget it.

1270
01:54:05,143 --> 01:54:06,395
Just forget it.

1271
01:54:09,648 --> 01:54:10,732
l see.

1272
01:54:21,618 --> 01:54:23,412
l really do love you.

1273
01:54:24,997 --> 01:54:26,999
Yes. Yes, l think...

1274
01:54:29,376 --> 01:54:31,169
...l think you do love me.

1275
01:54:40,554 --> 01:54:42,055
You...you all right?

1276
01:54:45,642 --> 01:54:47,394
ls there anything l can...

1277
01:54:49,605 --> 01:54:50,939
...do for you?

1278
01:54:55,319 --> 01:54:57,904
l just think l should sleep a little while.

1279
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:19,676
Oh, shit!

1280
01:55:22,846 --> 01:55:23,847
Magazines?

1281
01:55:24,890 --> 01:55:25,724
No.

1282
01:55:26,850 --> 01:55:27,935
lt's a long trip.

1283
01:55:32,856 --> 01:55:33,899
Chocolate?

1284
01:55:35,442 --> 01:55:36,318
No.

1285
01:55:44,826 --> 01:55:46,536
-We seem to be here.
-Yes.

1286
01:55:48,830 --> 01:55:51,041
l'd love to come down
on the platform with you...

1287
01:55:51,208 --> 01:55:53,377
...and wave a tiny,
white handkerchief etcetera...

1288
01:55:54,002 --> 01:55:55,879
...but there is that interview.

1289
01:55:56,338 --> 01:55:58,006
lt may not amount to anything...

1290
01:55:58,173 --> 01:55:59,591
...but you never know.

1291
01:56:18,151 --> 01:56:19,236
Shocking.

1292
01:56:27,911 --> 01:56:28,912
