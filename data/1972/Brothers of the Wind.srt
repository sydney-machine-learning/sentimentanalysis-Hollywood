1
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:46,399
Somewhere in the Alps, 1960's

2
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,698
Once upon a time...

3
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,916
upon the wind...

4
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,911
there was a bird.

5
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,043
This tale belongs to him...

6
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,254
and to a boy.

7
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:10,090
I just played a part.
But somehow it is my story too.

8
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,813
I am Danzer,

9
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,447
the forester.

10
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:34,406
I take care of every wild thing
that calls these mountains home.

11
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,590
There was a time,
when I shared in the life of one bird.

12
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,837
But... I go too fast.

13
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,005
This is jumping to the end.

14
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,051
Let us start at the very beginning.

15
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:10,609
Brothers of the Wind

16
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:37,469
He came into this world... a prince,

17
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,512
that's how I thought of him.

18
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:48,362
Because to me, his parents
were the king and queen of my valley.

19
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:05,212
The time would soon arrive for them
to pass their kingdom on.

20
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,791
But perhaps not to him,

21
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,091
because he was born the second.

22
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:19,681
One who is older and stronger awaits him.

23
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:25,440
And so it was, that from the first,
they were not only brothers...

24
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,394
but rivals for the throne.

25
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,533
The father too had his opponent.

26
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,791
A man...

27
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,675
called Keller.

28
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,115
Scout!

29
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,455
They knew nothing of the world,
but peace and plenty.

30
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,930
But, one day brought danger.
And a change...

31
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,681
forever.

32
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,433
She knows he will not return.

33
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,979
And what of them...

34
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,152
fatherless.

35
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,493
How shall they survive?

36
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,729
I'd say, they are beyond even your care,

37
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,778
- Danzer.
- No one would spare the other...

38
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,859
Life is cruel.

39
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:05,990
To us all.

40
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,072
How is Lukas?

41
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,994
The wind is cold.

42
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,128
Unnaturally so.

43
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,053
Lukas...

44
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,215
He's a strange one. He...

45
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,593
only speaks with nature.

46
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,603
Scout!

47
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,799
Lukas!

48
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,134
Where are you going?

49
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:16,440
Perhaps the boy was like the little eagle
before they ever met.

50
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,605
Home held no comfort.

51
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:30,200
And so, the battle
between the brothers begins.

52
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,691
This was once the home of Lukas,

53
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,023
but now it is his secret.

54
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,487
A hideaway,

55
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,652
from his father.

56
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,775
From the world.

57
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,052
The place he comes to remember.

58
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,729
Where memories burn.

59
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,319
Lukas!

60
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,625
The Sunday special.

61
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,962
When we have finished the fence.

62
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,178
A capercaillie.

63
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,677
Like your mother used to cook.

64
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,947
The time has come for her to choose:

65
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:57,410
left alone,
she can only raise one to be king.

66
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,667
Then...

67
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,042
the day of the ravens arrived.

68
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,591
Omens of misfortune.

69
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,114
She hears him cry, but...

70
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,574
there is another call of duty.

71
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,292
This day should have been his last.

72
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,337
But it was in fact... the beginning.

73
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:25,938
Scout!

74
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,943
Scout!

75
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,819
Don't be afraid.

76
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,335
You must be cold.

77
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,562
I won't harm you.

78
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,611
Come.

79
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,364
Did your brother kick you out, eh?

80
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:54,554
Don't worry, I'll make you a nest.
One of your own.

81
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,061
You must be hungry.

82
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,189
You don't like bread?

83
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,488
It's all I have.

84
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,006
I'll come back soon.

85
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,007
With lots of food.

86
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,618
No, no.

87
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,655
Wait, wait.

88
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,039
Wait.

89
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,710
Look, look!

90
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,578
I'm sorry.

91
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,875
I started to...

92
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,502
Eagles are famously hard to feed.

93
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,928
Sausages...

94
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,345
That's very bad for him.

95
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,479
Look what I have.

96
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,349
Duck liver.

97
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,776
That's good for him.

98
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,737
Take it!

99
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,539
Your father must be wondering
where you are.

100
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,750
Why provoke him, Lukas?

101
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,925
That you don't talk,
that angers him enough.

102
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,967
And yet he...

103
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,350
He doesn't recognize his own silence.

104
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,937
I never heard him talk about that day.

105
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,691
He's buried it deep inside.

106
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,990
And so have you.

107
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,157
But one day your voice will come.

108
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,247
Oh, you like to read.

109
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,718
"Brothers of the Wind"

110
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,562
Sunlight!

111
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,600
Essential to develop his feathers.

112
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,894
Hey! Where are you going?

113
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,351
Did you forget our capercaillie?

114
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,686
Come on!

115
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,645
Hey, Lukas!

116
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,647
I'm talking to you!

117
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,816
Aren't you hungry? No?

118
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:03,286
So you need more chores
to work up an appetite! Come on!

119
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,867
Take this!

120
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,659
Lukas!

121
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,587
Lukas!

122
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,331
Food is ready!

123
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:36,413
Damn!

124
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,335
Lukas!

125
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,711
Lukas!

126
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,139
Go!

127
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,395
Go away! Go!

128
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:33,573
I did a bad thing.
But something good came from it.

129
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,124
This is for you!

130
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,261
You are growing fast!

131
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:56,534
Perhaps the book fell open
to that page by chance,

132
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,450
but his fingers found it.

133
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,793
The story of two brothers,

134
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,795
locked in battle.

135
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:08,542
The elder Cain,
determined to defeat his brother Abel.

136
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,713
And so the bird found a name.

137
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,432
He would call him Abel.

138
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:22,393
And this time,
Lukas would give the story his own ending.

139
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:25,271
Abel would survive.

140
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:48,590
Somewhere out there,

141
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,877
Lukas knew that Cain was being fed,

142
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:56,298
taught and trained
to be king of these mountains.

143
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,028
Abel, here.

144
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,950
Here. See.

145
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,785
Come here. Come on!

146
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,950
You got to learn how to fly.

147
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:26,954
He's still too young.

148
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,623
He needs his feathers to change.

149
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,418
His instincts will guide him.

150
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,885
I've been talking to your father.

151
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:40,721
You know,

152
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,141
with the summer coming...

153
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,765
I could do with an extra pair of hands.

154
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,066
You could stay with me.

155
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,314
Keep me company in that big old house.

156
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,275
And I have more food than I need.

157
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,405
Plenty for two.

158
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,287
Plenty for all.

159
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,532
Lukas!

160
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,846
Bind this to his leg.
You'll be able to catch him!

161
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,112
You did it!

162
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,339
And then...

163
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,719
like this!

164
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:18,114
You can sleep here, if you want.

165
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,619
I thought you could use it
to train the eagle.

166
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,546
Lukas,

167
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,216
feel free to sleep wherever you want!

168
00:40:49,739 --> 00:40:50,991
I got it.

169
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:52,826
It's for you, Abel.

170
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,331
Here.

171
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:58,465
It's for you, come on. You can eat it.

172
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,713
You have to pick it.

173
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,470
Abel, you have to be faster.

174
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,352
Or you will never eat them.

175
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,069
To learn takes courage.

176
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:26,076
And to teach, the patience of a mother.

177
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:32,912
She knows, to make her son take to the air,
temptation must be strong.

178
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,540
I watched her often,

179
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,080
always in wonder.

180
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:45,345
She will not rest
until she sees him take that leap.

181
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,291
Lukas may lack instinct.

182
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,543
But, he's a boy.

183
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,342
And with that comes invention.

184
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,409
Abel.

185
00:42:58,868 --> 00:42:59,994
Abel!

186
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,215
Come.

187
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,631
Jump, come on!

188
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:33,452
Jump.

189
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,204
Come on Abel, jump!

190
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,036
Abel,

191
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,962
you have to.

192
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,546
You have to jump!

193
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:01,431
You have to move your wings fast...

194
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,267
or you will never learn to fly.

195
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:07,813
Come on Abel,

196
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,572
open your wings!

197
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,904
Yeah, like that.

198
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:13,693
Come on,

199
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,362
you have to fly.

200
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:16,988
This is good, this is good.

201
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,329
Come on, you can do it.
Abel, you can do it.

202
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,038
Come on, jump!

203
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:25,288
You can do it. Come on!

204
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,377
Jump!

205
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:34,968
You did well!

206
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,972
Yeah, good boy.

207
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:27,309
Abel?

208
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,079
Abel?

209
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,963
Abel!

210
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,502
Abel!

211
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,104
Yeah, you did it!

212
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,813
Abel!

213
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,304
Yeah, Abel!

214
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,390
You did it!

215
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:04,663
Abel!

216
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,411
Abel!

217
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,259
Abel!

218
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,144
He told me,

219
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,483
all he found was a feather.

220
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:39,694
And I could see by his eyes, he feared...

221
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,159
this would be the last of Abel.

222
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:45,822
I tried to comfort him...
Abel would return.

223
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,540
He just needed a taste of the wild.

224
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:57,383
But in truth,

225
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,003
I didn't know what fate awaited him.

226
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,054
Like a child running wild,

227
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,316
Abel might find this adventure
costs his life.

228
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,930
In the days that followed,

229
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,349
I barely saw Lukas.

230
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,264
Always searching.

231
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,190
He could not rest.

232
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:03,569
His fears for Abel, never far.

233
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:26,168
He knew that there would be two dangers.

234
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,971
The greatest was his father's gun,

235
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,682
never far from his hand.

236
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,406
The other...

237
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:58,161
was Cain.

238
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:00,584
Always the stronger.

239
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,001
And now...

240
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,463
a hunter.

241
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:19,872
3 days.

242
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:22,450
For Lukas, a lifetime.

243
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,498
And still no sign.

244
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:17,797
Abel!

245
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,393
I was waiting for you.

246
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:33,316
I thought...

247
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,857
that you'll never come back.

248
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,242
But...

249
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,532
you were flying.

250
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,368
Flying, finally Abel!

251
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,729
Abel learned to fly.

252
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:10,858
And Lukas learned
that hope should never die.

253
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:14,854
Come on, Abel!

254
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,571
A lesson to remember.

255
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,528
But the boy knew...

256
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:25,072
more teaching lay ahead.

257
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,543
Abel must discover how to hunt.

258
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,789
Hunting is about speed and timing.

259
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,791
So we teach him this way:

260
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:41,092
The eagle sees the carcass,

261
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,178
tied to the end of the rope.

262
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,801
And then we wait...

263
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:48,642
until he starts to descend.

264
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:53,400
And when he goes
to the snatch we... chack!

265
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:57,028
And like a marmot into a burrow...

266
00:55:58,647 --> 00:55:59,899
He's gone!

267
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:14,580
Is he working for you or you for him?

268
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:20,465
- He has you building toys?
- Traps!

269
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:23,380
My own design.

270
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,015
You're a clever man!

271
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,272
For the summer, Danzer!

272
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:35,818
That was the deal.
Don't think to outsmart me!

273
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,733
So now you show a want for him?

274
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,448
He's my son.

275
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,818
Never forget that!

276
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:21,981
You were fast.

277
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:24,317
But he was just faster!

278
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,693
Let's push him harder!

279
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,384
Scout!

280
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,306
Scout!

281
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:56,272
Stop!

282
00:57:58,558 --> 00:57:59,730
Scout!

283
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,411
His first real catch.

284
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,293
I thought he was going for the dog.

285
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:34,391
It's time, Lukas.

286
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,017
Summer is over.

287
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,941
You have to go back to your father.

288
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,526
And you must return Abel to his world.

289
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:46,315
No!

290
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,489
A word, at last.

291
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:56,583
Abel has his instinct.

292
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:01,004
A memory of what it was to be wild.

293
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:06,927
If you keep him, those urges will fade.

294
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:10,426
He won't be able to return
to the mountain.

295
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,058
He will never be free.

296
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,599
Is that what you want?

297
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:02,937
We had to take him far,

298
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:07,438
to the mountains
where Cain could claim no kingdom.

299
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:13,828
I told Lukas, here Abel would have
a chance, to find his own way.

300
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:42,644
I envied the boy his faith.

301
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:46,690
In my heart I made my own farewell.

302
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,529
You will survive.

303
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,871
You will come back.

304
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:05,412
You will see me again.

305
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:21,575
I feared that winter
would be the end to Abel's story.

306
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:25,658
The snow that year was so cruel.

307
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,922
Even an eagle's eye could be deceived.

308
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,442
The sky and the snow...

309
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,360
became one.

310
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:39,520
The snow held Lukas home.

311
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:42,360
Unable to escape to his hiding place,

312
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:44,399
he was trapped.

313
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:46,819
He must wait for the thaw.

314
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,035
And if he did not know the fate of Abel,

315
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:54,667
he could still help others... live.

316
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:00,747
Abel!

317
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:04,785
His summer with me was just a memory.

318
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,833
But under his coat,

319
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:11,795
I knew he carried
the falconers glove I gave him.

320
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:15,758
In his heart... he carried hope.

321
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:32,055
Lukas.

322
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:35,138
Lukas!

323
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:08,630
Lukas!

324
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:15,887
Don't move!

325
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:24,941
Careful!

326
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,572
Careful, careful.

327
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:38,166
I'm here.

328
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,042
Lukas.

329
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,465
It's ok.

330
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:57,304
That moment to me
felt like the end of a chapter.

331
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:18,116
But the wild is wiser.

332
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,964
This was not a chapter closing...

333
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,878
just beginning.

334
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:34,973
Abel had returned to the valley.

335
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:39,053
But his challenge was not over.

336
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:42,398
Here, in the place of his birth,

337
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:44,684
a brother awaits him.

338
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:53,401
This was the brother
who forced him from the nest.

339
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:57,200
Cain...

340
01:16:57,363 --> 01:16:58,660
the older,

341
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:00,416
the stronger.

342
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:03,127
Time would tell who would be king.

343
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,423
And time was passing.

344
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:11,802
Winter once again was Spring.

345
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:18,635
And Lukas healed... his leg at least.

346
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:24,516
But the hurt between his father and himself
showed no signs of mending.

347
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:28,569
Once upon a time there were two brothers.

348
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:30,904
The Brothers of the Wind.

349
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:34,738
The sadness and the silence...
it remained.

350
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:39,447
Although, he was stronger
than his brother.

351
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:41,950
But there are many ways to victory.

352
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:46,704
Their story, it seemed,

353
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,373
was set.

354
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,087
So...

355
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:52,843
How is the ending?

356
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:56,510
There is no more.

357
01:17:58,215 --> 01:18:00,309
But... what happened after?

358
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:03,312
Even if we had the last page,

359
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:06,565
I fear it wouldn't tell us
how the brothers fare on.

360
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:09,068
And do we need the end?

361
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,942
Sometimes in life, Lukas,

362
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:15,942
you have to make up your own endings.

363
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,536
Tell your own story.

364
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:53,029
It was as if Abel too
had heard these words.

365
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:07,535
The final chapter must come
between himself and Cain.

366
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:46,157
And it must come now.

367
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:20,907
There are many ways to victory.

368
01:20:21,692 --> 01:20:24,161
Courage can win respect.

369
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:33,045
Lukas knew what it was to be brave.

370
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:36,082
But respect was gone.

371
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:41,428
And the boy felt the instinct to leave.

372
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:43,801
Move on.

373
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:23,295
That day...

374
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:25,931
I witnessed something wonderful.

375
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:31,019
One prince and his brother...

376
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:32,771
at peace.

377
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:45,067
I wondered...

378
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:48,408
could I hope for one more miracle?

379
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:53,372
That the return of Abel
would keep Lukas from leaving.

380
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:25,737
To find his friend.

381
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:30,325
This was the reason he gave himself
for packing his bag.

382
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:34,700
But I think he was searching
for something else.

383
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,908
This is where you come.

384
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:23,128
When it burned you cried but now
you can't even open your mouth, eh?

385
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:27,878
I remember her voice.

386
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:30,889
Can you imagine how I cried?

387
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:42,643
Light me the matches.

388
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:44,319
Come!

389
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:53,532
Look at me!

390
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:08,968
Lukas!

391
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,119
Lukas!

392
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:39,764
Abel!

393
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:41,394
Abel!

394
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:01,600
Abel?

395
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,477
No.

396
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:07,101
It's me.

397
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:17,399
I'm sorry.

398
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:20,490
I'm so sorry.

399
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:49,231
A few Years later

400
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,938
- Hey!
- I'm ok.

401
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:38,238
You see: I'm strong!

402
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:41,946
You were always stronger than me.

403
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:40,091
This must stop.

404
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,843
You won't find him.

405
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:46,006
He's here.

406
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:49,551
- Somewhere.
- But how can you know that?

407
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:51,516
I don't have to know.

408
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:53,518
I just have to believe.

409
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,682
- Abel died in the storm.
- No!

410
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:57,809
That was his brother!

411
01:29:57,976 --> 01:30:01,526
- Abel survived.
- Abel is gone you have to accept it.

412
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:05,951
This dream that he'll return,

413
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:07,569
forget it.

414
01:30:08,153 --> 01:30:10,326
Put it out of your head.

415
01:30:13,742 --> 01:30:16,370
Put out your arm, Lukas!

416
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,003
Stretch your arm!

417
01:30:41,728 --> 01:30:43,275
I found him.

418
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:46,441
I'd say he found you.

419
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:02,169
We found each other.

420
01:31:14,052 --> 01:31:17,056
- What are you doing?
- Now he's free!

421
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,266
Forever.

422
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:39,586
It once broke his heart to let Abel go.

423
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:43,290
But now Lukas understands,

424
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:45,258
that to let go...

425
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:47,385
is to be free.

426
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,850
Free from the past.

427
01:31:58,138 --> 01:32:01,563
Free to believe that destinies can change.

428
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,566
The book of life...

429
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:12,361
is ours to write.

430
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:22,166
Let's go.
