00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:12,802
In <i>Three Contributions to the
Theory of Sex,</i> Freud wrote...

2
00:00:12,827 --> 00:00:17,048
about the fantasies and
Illnesses of disturbed sex.

3
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:21,337
His theory is that life falls into four
phases: Oral, Anal, Phallic and Genital.

4
00:00:21,362 --> 00:00:25,584
Sexual hang-ups involve
a fixation at one phase.

5
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:29,966
This film is designed in a broad and
humorous way to illustrate a psychiatrist's...

6
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:34,401
treatment of a girl, and his use of a ploy
and the power of suggestion to overcome...

7
00:00:34,426 --> 00:00:38,726
that fixation and the ultimate maturation
of the girl into the genital phase.

8
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:43,050
The use of the power of suggestion in
the sexual evolution of the girl...

9
00:00:43,075 --> 00:00:46,915
is based on fables written about by Wilhelm
Jensen in the famous <i>GRADIVA</i>.

10
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,015
Helen, I'm home.
- Linda? I'm in here, hon.

11
00:05:53,892 --> 00:05:55,820
That's a pretty site.

12
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:00,380
I really hope I'm not interrupting.

13
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:03,496
No, not at all.
They are your groceries too.

14
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:06,579
Give me a hand putting them away,
will you hon?

15
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:19,497
I really want another cigarette,
will you hon?

16
00:06:28,677 --> 00:06:31,883
Mind if I smoke
while your 'eating'?

17
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:34,010
No, not at all.

18
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:55,195
Where are you going, love?

19
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:57,549
I'm gonna slide off another bannister.

20
00:06:58,974 --> 00:07:01,114
Think he wants some warm supper.

21
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,995
Boy, that was good.

22
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:47,425
Why don't you take a dip,
it will cool you off.

23
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,894
No, maybe later.
- Got any more lotion?

24
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:53,382
Love?
- What?

25
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,549
Suntan oil.
- Oh, here.

26
00:09:57,191 --> 00:10:00,381
You alright?
- Yeah I'm fine, what makes you say that?

27
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:04,378
You, the way you're acting.
You've been moping around all day.

28
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:07,392
It's us, me, the way we live.

29
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:10,134
What the hell is wrong
with the way we live?

30
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:14,758
With my alimony check and your
old man's allowance, we'll do alright.

31
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,836
Who's got it better?
- Alright, what are you doing tonight?

32
00:10:18,907 --> 00:10:23,817
I don't know, dinner,
probably go to the Dogs.

33
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:27,864
With whom?
- You know. What's his name?

34
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:30,658
There, that's it.
I'll never forget what's his name.

35
00:10:30,815 --> 00:10:34,615
Look Helen, there's got to be more
to life than just screwing around.

36
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:36,960
Boy, you sound like you're
ready to settle down.

37
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,475
The house, the kids and all that.

38
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:41,986
But not for me, Love.
I've been to that place.

39
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:45,489
That's just it.
I can't get married.

40
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:51,350
I know of at least a half a dozen guys that
would just jump at the chance to marry you.

41
00:10:51,508 --> 00:10:57,688
It wouldn't work. I would be
miserable and make him miserable too.

42
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:00,797
Why?

43
00:11:00,972 --> 00:11:02,511
Sex.

44
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:05,579
Sex?
- Yes, I don't enjoy it.

45
00:11:05,722 --> 00:11:09,598
What do you mean you don't enjoy it?
- Alright, that's not all together right.

46
00:11:10,153 --> 00:11:14,868
It makes me feel so tingly all over, and then...
- And then what?

47
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:18,963
Nothing. There should be
more to sex than a lot of little tingles.

48
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:23,561
There should be bells ringing, dams
bursting, bombs going off, something.

49
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:25,973
Do you want to get off or
do you want to wreck a city?

50
00:11:26,123 --> 00:11:27,719
Helen please, be serious.

51
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:32,434
Then you've never gotten off?
- No.

52
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:34,318
Never?
- Never.

53
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,747
Oh, what the hell honey.
Different strokes to different folks.

54
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:39,599
Maybe you're not doing it right.

55
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:44,270
How do you mean?
How many ways are there?

56
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:49,052
There is a lot more to fucking than just
bam bam thank you ma'am.

57
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:52,542
You have to find what is right for you.
- How?

58
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:56,388
Experimenting.
What do you say, we get a bunch of guys up here?

59
00:11:56,504 --> 00:11:59,786
Someone's got to get
your bells ringing, OK?

60
00:11:59,897 --> 00:12:03,442
OK, the way I feel,
I'll try anything.

61
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:36,541
Hi, how are you?
- Fine, how are you?

62
00:12:36,628 --> 00:12:41,422
Good. We're not late or anything, are we?
- No, you're just in time.

63
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,562
You'll have number 11.

64
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,843
You'll have 12.

65
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:51,125
Just have a drink, sit down, relax
until your number is called.

66
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:54,077
What are we doing, holding a raffle here?
- I never win anything anyway.

67
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:59,422
Don't worry honey, everybody gets a piece of this action.
- Promise?

68
00:20:56,693 --> 00:20:58,550
Who has number 11?

69
00:20:58,804 --> 00:21:00,304
Come with me, you're next.

70
00:21:00,335 --> 00:21:03,383
I can't handle it, man.
You should have been here 2 minutes ago.

71
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,415
How about you?

72
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:08,216
Anybody left?

73
00:21:10,768 --> 00:21:15,405
What's a nice joint like
you doing in a girl like this?

74
00:21:15,585 --> 00:21:17,395
How did you get here?

75
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:21,919
Well listen, honey. You called me,
I didn't call you.

76
00:21:23,643 --> 00:21:26,782
Some days nothing seems to go right.

77
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,092
Well, what now?
- I don't know. How many was it?

78
00:21:34,212 --> 00:21:36,611
14. Not counting those that wouldn't cry.

79
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,190
That's terrible English.
- All right, those who came twice.

80
00:21:40,373 --> 00:21:43,031
Well, since it's your idea,
what am I gonna do?

81
00:21:43,088 --> 00:21:44,907
You didn't get off once?

82
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:48,360
Sure I did, a hundred times,
and it was great, but...

83
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,715
But what?

84
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:54,185
Not real, you know like: Bells ringing and
dams bursting and bombs going off.

85
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,024
There you go again.
You wanna get off or destroy a city?

86
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,622
Please Helen, get serious.

87
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:05,097
What can I do?
- I don't know, let me think.

88
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,363
How about...
- What?

89
00:22:09,316 --> 00:22:11,363
Dr. Young.
- A doctor?

90
00:22:11,475 --> 00:22:14,792
A psychiatrist. A real thing,
but as horny as hell.

91
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:18,000
He might be able to do the trick.
- I don't understand.

92
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:21,463
Well, you might have a mental block.
Or something.

93
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:24,039
A mental block?
- A hang up...

94
00:22:24,173 --> 00:22:27,252
A block. Where you wanna do something,
your brain says like, you know...

95
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:30,488
...you can't do that, because of
an old pattern that was developing.

96
00:22:36,794 --> 00:22:40,012
Well it's, it's really quite common.

97
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:43,197
Perhaps you've had a traumatic
experience as a child.

98
00:22:43,384 --> 00:22:45,416
No, I do not think so.

99
00:22:45,868 --> 00:22:52,113
Nothing unpleasant that could have possibly
turned you off to sex? When you were younger?

100
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:55,966
You're getting me all wet, please stop it.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Nurse!

101
00:22:56,045 --> 00:22:59,728
Nurse, Miss Lovelace is
done with her bubbles.

102
00:23:01,101 --> 00:23:03,677
Hmm, nothing turns you off to sex.

103
00:23:03,744 --> 00:23:08,318
Listen Doctor, please,
I'm not turned off to sex.

104
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:13,066
I enjoy it. In fact I can spend the
rest of my life getting laid.

105
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:16,861
Well then, what's the problem?
- I don't know, something's missing.

106
00:23:17,043 --> 00:23:19,440
Something is missing?
- Yes.

107
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:23,167
There should be more to it
than a lot of little tingles.

108
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:29,184
I wanna hear bells, bombs.
And dams bursting.

109
00:23:29,263 --> 00:23:31,772
Rockets red glare.
- Bombs bursting in air.

110
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:35,478
Gave proof through the night
that our flag was still there.

111
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:39,436
Doctor, please be serious.
- Nurse! Nurse!

112
00:23:39,915 --> 00:23:41,392
Take that away.

113
00:23:41,512 --> 00:23:42,781
There's your problem.

114
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:46,114
You say that you want more out of
sex than just a lot of little tingles.

115
00:23:46,202 --> 00:23:48,442
Yes, I want to hear bells and bombs.

116
00:23:48,505 --> 00:23:52,434
Yes, we've just been through that, miss
Lovelace, let's not do that one again.

117
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:57,018
You know, I think your problem might
be physical, in stead of psychological.

118
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,643
Have you ever had an
internal examination?

119
00:24:00,954 --> 00:24:02,723
No, I don't think so.

120
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,776
Step into my examination room,
I wanna take a look at you.

121
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,128
We will have a look at you.

122
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,629
Oh, miss Lovelace,
those will have to go.

123
00:24:13,293 --> 00:24:15,902
Nurse, sterilization please.

124
00:24:28,772 --> 00:24:30,653
That will be all, thank you.

125
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:34,399
Let's have a look. Let's lift your leg.

126
00:24:48,068 --> 00:24:49,996
Oh, that's amazing!

127
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:52,575
Would you tell me, somebody
forgot his watch, huh?

128
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,584
No, no no.
It's truly amazing!

129
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:00,198
Miss Lovelace, you don't have one.

130
00:25:00,722 --> 00:25:03,523
Of course not, I am a woman,
I'm not supposed to have one

131
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,277
No, I don't mean one of those,
I mean, well you...

132
00:25:06,302 --> 00:25:08,817
You don't have a clitoris.
There is no clitoris here.

133
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:12,451
Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure, here, take a look.

134
00:25:15,028 --> 00:25:16,687
Well, I'll be damned.

135
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:20,427
Hmm, no wonder you hear no bells.
You have no tinkler!

136
00:25:20,838 --> 00:25:23,105
That's not funny!

137
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:27,552
Now now, Miss Lovelace, please.
Try to compose yourself.

138
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,098
Tell me something... When you get laid,
that is when you have sexual intercourse...

139
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:35,665
what excites you on the most?

140
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:41,342
Giving head.
- Really, giving head?

141
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,913
What do you feel?
- Sort of excited.

142
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,927
Where?

143
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:51,328
You'll laugh.
- No no, miss Lovelace, I won't laugh.

144
00:25:52,162 --> 00:25:53,558
I get excited...

145
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,261
here.

146
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:03,369
Come, missis Lovelace, let me have
a look in there. Open your mouth.

147
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:08,240
Open your mouth wider.
Wider, A A A A A.

148
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:15,437
Well, there it is.
You little bugger! There it is!

149
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:20,095
What?
- Your clitoris is deep down in the bottom of your throat.

150
00:26:23,476 --> 00:26:28,556
Listen, having a clitoris deep down in the bottom of
your throat is better than having no clitoris at all.

151
00:26:29,103 --> 00:26:31,294
That's easy for you to say.

152
00:26:32,596 --> 00:26:36,176
Suppose your balls were in your ears.

153
00:26:37,284 --> 00:26:40,133
Then I should hear myself coming.

154
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,895
Listen, we have the problem solved. All
we have to do now is find a solution.

155
00:26:48,131 --> 00:26:49,709
Like what?

156
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:00,144
Like... <i>Deep Throat</i>.

157
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,507
<i>Deep</i> what?
- <i>Throat</i>.

158
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:07,927
Have you ever taken a penis all the way
down to the bottom of your throat?

159
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:13,260
No, I try, but I choke.
- Well, now I hear it's a matter of discipline.

160
00:27:13,555 --> 00:27:16,269
You have to learn to relax the muscles...

161
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,777
You have to regulate your breathing
to the movement of your head.

162
00:27:21,176 --> 00:27:24,951
You make it sound so easy.
- Well, it is!

163
00:27:25,274 --> 00:27:30,137
Try it. You'll like it.
- Well, what have I got to lose?

164
00:27:30,405 --> 00:27:32,734
Come, you try it with me.

165
00:27:39,537 --> 00:27:41,366
Come, dear.

166
00:27:48,431 --> 00:27:56,181
Now I'm gonna tell you,
the way it has to be.

167
00:27:56,629 --> 00:28:05,319
And if you pay attention
I'm sure that you will see.

168
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:13,893
Just relax your muscles
and once you hit that spot.

169
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:22,693
Keep right on pushing
and give it all you got.

170
00:28:23,511 --> 00:28:31,434
Now we've found your tinkler
the solution is quite clear

171
00:28:31,887 --> 00:28:41,184
For if we both can hit it now
the bells you'll surely hear.

172
00:32:26,867 --> 00:32:31,711
Oh, Dr. Young, how could I ever repay you?
You saved my life.

173
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:35,218
I'm a fulfilled woman.
I've heard the bells at last.

174
00:32:35,243 --> 00:32:38,203
Oh, Dr. Young, marry me.
I want to be your slave.

175
00:32:38,405 --> 00:32:41,722
Linda, I can't marry you.
- What do you mean, you can't marry me?

176
00:32:42,032 --> 00:32:44,402
My nurse, she won't let me.
And how much...

177
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,663
Deep throat do you
think I can take?

178
00:32:48,283 --> 00:32:53,397
Oh no, you're not getting off that easy.
You've shown me the way.

179
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:57,738
And now you wanna throw me out on the
street to go from one man to another?

180
00:32:57,885 --> 00:33:03,337
What, are you are crazy? It's all your fault.
Don't you understand? I need it. I need Love.

181
00:33:03,393 --> 00:33:08,654
Calm down. Listen, I'm not throwing you
out. You can find your love and happiness.

182
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:15,354
In the meantime, you can come to work for me
here in the office and make some house calls.

183
00:33:16,307 --> 00:33:18,841
I don't understand.
- You don't have to...

184
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,705
That is...
I'll make you a physiotherapist.

185
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,474
I don't know anything about physio...

186
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,974
I'll teach you, I'll teach you.

187
00:33:27,387 --> 00:33:33,173
Would you really, Dr. Young? When do we start?
- Right now, if you like.

188
00:33:33,308 --> 00:33:35,832
Oh, the sooner the better.
Will I need anything?

189
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:38,902
Just a uniform.
- No equipment?

190
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:43,443
Linda, you were born with all the
equipment you will ever need.

191
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:42,690
I'd like to teach you all
to screw in perfect harmony.

192
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:47,370
I'd like to see you all get laid.

193
00:36:48,403 --> 00:36:55,427
I'd like to see you all get laid
but leave a piece for me

194
00:36:55,474 --> 00:37:00,064
Case 358. Albert Finster.
Age 25, bachelor.

195
00:37:00,874 --> 00:37:06,104
Has an obsession in finding out that
really do go better with coke.

196
00:37:06,636 --> 00:37:08,965
Relax your muscles, my dear.

197
00:37:09,922 --> 00:37:16,316
Try a little trick
please don't think less of me

198
00:37:17,078 --> 00:37:23,840
I'd like to drink a little coke
where you used to be

199
00:37:23,912 --> 00:37:31,515
Now, it's the real thing
come, lick my straw

200
00:37:32,188 --> 00:37:39,244
It's the real thing
now baby come and ask for more

201
00:39:27,062 --> 00:39:34,292
Case 653. Jacob Maltz. Age 52.
He's a widower, no children.

202
00:39:34,922 --> 00:39:38,634
Has not had sexual intercourse
since his passed away 3 years ago.

203
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:41,942
And refuses to go to bed with
anybody until he's married.

204
00:39:42,066 --> 00:39:44,891
He has recently developed
severe pains in the groin

205
00:39:44,978 --> 00:39:47,645
believed pains to be a
result of sexual abstinence.

206
00:39:48,058 --> 00:39:52,131
I've sent my therapist over, miss
Linda Lovelace, to relieve the pain.

207
00:40:02,612 --> 00:40:05,548
Tell me Mr. Maltz, how do you feel now?

208
00:40:05,642 --> 00:40:11,034
Wonderful. I haven't felt this
good since my poor Sarah passed away.

209
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,191
I'm so glad.

210
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:15,812
You don't know how good it makes me feel,
to know that I've been of some help to you.

211
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:22,927
You're an angel. You've helped me. Maybe you can
give me a treatment like that, 2 or 3 times a week?

212
00:40:23,102 --> 00:40:24,586
I'll be glad to, Mr. Maltz.

213
00:40:24,681 --> 00:40:28,151
But are you sure you can afford it?
These are expensive treatments, you know.

214
00:40:28,866 --> 00:40:35,080
Don't worry, money is no object.
Look, I got Blue Cross.

215
00:41:15,148 --> 00:41:20,603
Case 007. Dr. Young, that is old Dr. Young

216
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:28,770
Trying to ball two nurses simultaneously.
Can't go on.

217
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:32,596
How much of this deep throat
do you think I can take?

218
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:36,687
Wounded in the line of duty. Near death.

219
00:51:53,949 --> 00:51:57,553
Case 218. Wilbur Wayne. 26.

220
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:01,152
Heir to the Wayne
Hula Hoop fortune.

221
00:52:03,841 --> 00:52:06,051
Exceptionally shy and retiring.

222
00:52:06,117 --> 00:52:09,802
He's only aroused when he feels
he is overpowering his partner.

223
00:52:10,453 --> 00:52:14,866
He assumes the role of a burglar, and
likes to believe he's raping his victim.

224
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:22,079
I believe Linda Lovelace is ideally suited
to bring him out of this dilemma.

225
00:52:22,263 --> 00:52:26,580
Also, if she is attracted to him,
they would be well suited to each other.

226
00:52:27,516 --> 00:52:30,008
How is that?
- Oh, just fine dear.

227
00:52:30,434 --> 00:52:35,103
I need a big strong man.

228
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,773
Who are you? What do you want?

229
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,633
This is a stickup.
Your money, or your life.

230
00:52:52,681 --> 00:52:57,244
Oh please, don't hurt me. You can have
anything you want, but don't hurt me.

231
00:52:57,614 --> 00:53:00,757
Here, but please, don't hurt me.

232
00:53:01,432 --> 00:53:04,899
No, I'm gonna to rape you.
Don't cry out. I've got this gun.

233
00:53:05,138 --> 00:53:08,044
OK, but please, don't hurt me.

234
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:11,577
Oh no! You're supposed
to be frightened.

235
00:53:11,725 --> 00:53:13,140
I'm sorry, Wilbur.

236
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:16,423
Let's do it again.
I'll do it better this time.

237
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:21,220
Well, you always spoil it.
Don't want me to have any fun.

238
00:53:21,606 --> 00:53:25,779
You're so masterful, Wilbur.
I just can't help myself.

239
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:28,930
I get all weak when you come
here with that mask and all.

240
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:33,692
Come on Wilbur, let's go to bed.
You've got me all hot.

241
00:53:33,962 --> 00:53:37,127
Oh, OK. But remember,
I'm raping you.

242
00:53:37,223 --> 00:53:39,881
If you don't do everything I say,
I'm gonna shoot ya.

243
00:53:39,971 --> 00:53:44,707
OK, masked marvel. Anything you say.
You know I do anything for you.

244
00:53:44,825 --> 00:53:47,795
Would you really?
You're not just saying that?

245
00:53:47,865 --> 00:53:53,384
No, I mean it, really.
You've got me all tingly inside.

246
00:53:53,968 --> 00:53:56,693
I love you Linda, marry me?

247
00:53:56,773 --> 00:53:58,813
I'll make you happy. Please.

248
00:53:58,876 --> 00:54:04,623
Oh Wilbur, I like you,
but I can't marry you.

249
00:54:05,312 --> 00:54:08,232
Why can't you marry me?
Don't you believe I love you?

250
00:54:08,368 --> 00:54:12,106
It's not just that, I believe you.
It's just, well...

251
00:54:13,169 --> 00:54:15,860
well... the man I marry has to...

252
00:54:16,741 --> 00:54:19,820
The man I marry has to have a 9 inch cock.

253
00:54:20,449 --> 00:54:24,603
Oh, I see, in that case I don't
blame you for not wanting me.

254
00:54:24,714 --> 00:54:27,381
Wilbur, It's my fault, not yours.

255
00:54:27,532 --> 00:54:31,254
It's always something. All my life.
Something has always messed me up.

256
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:34,429
Just think, I'm only 4 inches
away from happiness.

257
00:54:34,492 --> 00:54:38,006
It's Dr. Young's fault.
- Yeah, that Dr. Young.

258
00:54:38,085 --> 00:54:42,814
Hey Wilbur, why don't you give him a call?
Maybe he can do something.

259
00:54:42,917 --> 00:54:46,576
You know, like an operation
or some silicone injections.

260
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:48,372
You really think so?

261
00:54:48,396 --> 00:54:51,727
Maybe. It's worth the try.
Come on, give him a call.

262
00:55:07,019 --> 00:55:12,640
Hello, Dr. Young, it's Wilbur.
Yes, you've gotta help me.

263
00:55:12,862 --> 00:55:17,196
I'm in love. With Linda.
We want to get married.

264
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:21,862
Thank you. There is only one problem
she needs a 9 inch cock.

265
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,431
Doctor, please help me?

266
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,434
I'm only 4 inches away from happiness.

267
00:55:27,939 --> 00:55:29,355
You can?

268
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:32,379
Any size I want?

269
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,727
Tomorrow?

270
00:55:34,807 --> 00:55:39,246
Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
I'll see you then, thank you.

271
00:55:39,882 --> 00:55:44,139
He said he could do it.
He can cut it at any size you want.
