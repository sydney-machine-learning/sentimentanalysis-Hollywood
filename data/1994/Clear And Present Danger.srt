1
00:01:16,589 --> 00:01:20,025
Target bearing 0-2-0.

2
00:01:20,193 --> 00:01:22,093
Contact 0-2-0.

3
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:25,560
- Range 20,000.
- Range 20,000 yards.

4
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:29,690
- Course 2-5-5.
- Course 2-5-5 true.

5
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:33,270
- Speed 13.
- Speed 13 knots.

6
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,703
Cowboys.

7
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:10,039
Man the guns.

8
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:42,303
Enchanter, Mobile.

9
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:48,239
Well, we're a long way from home.
Wake 'em up!

10
00:03:13,873 --> 00:03:18,071
Enchanter!
This is the US Coast Guard!

11
00:03:18,244 --> 00:03:21,338
Heave to and prepare to be boarded!

12
00:03:35,194 --> 00:03:39,426
Enchanter! You are a US flagged ship,
and we are going to board you.

13
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,824
Heave to now!

14
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:56,440
I want to see your crew on the bow.

15
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:15,730
You two, move forward.

16
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:18,199
Randall, come with me.

17
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:26,736
- What do you want?
- Kneel down.

18
00:04:30,116 --> 00:04:34,450
Captain... Captain?

19
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,110
Go ahead, Senior Chief.

20
00:04:36,956 --> 00:04:41,984
It's a bad one. I think you'd better
send over the video camera.

21
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:02,045
Jack, come on in.

22
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,780
- How high is the pile on your desk?
- About this high.

23
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:10,444
- Now it's this high.
- What have you got?

24
00:05:10,623 --> 00:05:15,617
You heard about that business in
the south Caribbean? I need the details.

25
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:18,093
- By when?
- As soon as you can.

26
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:22,796
- OK.
- Jack? Be discreet.

27
00:05:24,837 --> 00:05:27,203
What do you mean?

28
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:29,307
You'll find out.

29
00:05:30,643 --> 00:05:33,339
Mysterious...

30
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:36,981
I love a mystery.

31
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:44,313
- Ryan, John P.
- Let him through.

32
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,353
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

33
00:05:49,528 --> 00:05:53,089
- You know where you're going?
- Yes. Thank you.

34
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:57,599
- Oh, where do I park?
- Right over there.

35
00:06:08,447 --> 00:06:10,677
...main passageway, going forward...

36
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,683
...master stateroom...
blood on the deck...

37
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:17,584
19 cartridges were recovered...

38
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:23,354
...as well as
the two weapons that fired them.

39
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:30,264
The blood samples taken were
consistent with the crew, Hardin...

40
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:33,894
...and his wife
and his son and daughter.

41
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:38,500
...blood on sheets and pillows...

42
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:43,205
...on both starboard and port side racks.
And on the mirror too.

43
00:06:43,382 --> 00:06:48,376
They were killed in their staterooms,
apparently as they slept.

44
00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:50,886
Dragged topside and thrown overboard.

45
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:57,385
The two men in custody surrendered
after a brief attempt to escape.

46
00:06:57,563 --> 00:07:00,828
What do we know about them?
The men in custody?

47
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:07,404
Half a dozen arrests for drug
trafficking in Bogota, Mr President.

48
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:09,938
Drugs.

49
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:15,276
Suspected ties to the Cali cartel,
not Medellin...

50
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:16,847
You all right, James?

51
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:19,143
...according to DEA.

52
00:07:19,318 --> 00:07:21,946
- Why?
- Nothing exotic, sir.

53
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:25,284
Straight piracy and murder.
It's not the first time.

54
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:30,925
It's the first time it was a friend of mine.

55
00:07:32,698 --> 00:07:34,791
Yes, sir.

56
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:44,643
- What was that? You all right?
- Yeah.

57
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,370
I haven't slept in 36 hours.
I make any sense?

58
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:51,073
I don't know. What did you say?
Just kidding. Good job.

59
00:07:54,753 --> 00:08:00,157
- You should give diplomacy lessons.
- To call it as I see it is my job.

60
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:03,625
- And he's yours.
- Wait for me.

61
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,165
Shut the door.

62
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:18,142
I promised the American people
I'd do something about the drug problem.

63
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,278
You are.

64
00:08:20,446 --> 00:08:24,576
We support the Colombians' efforts
against the cartels...

65
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:30,279
We've accomplished nothing. Do these
drug dealers think we're powerless?

66
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:35,758
That they can keep doing this kind
of thing, and there's no response ever?

67
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:41,427
Are you suggesting
a course of action, sir?

68
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,402
The course of action I'd suggest
is a course of action I can't suggest.

69
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:05,448
I'm... not sure where that leaves us.

70
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:13,328
These drug cartels represent
a clear and present danger

71
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:17,196
to the national security
of the United States.

72
00:09:52,404 --> 00:09:55,771
Cortez, Cortez..!

73
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:50,719
That doesn't surprise me.

74
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,122
- It should at least concern you.
- What can they do?

75
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,599
Come after me? Arrest me?

76
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:00,932
You're scaring me.

77
00:11:02,474 --> 00:11:07,241
Will you stop long enough
for me to tell you something important?

78
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:11,747
Thank you.

79
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:20,991
Listen... You pay me to counsel you,
and I am counselling you.

80
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,926
I'm keeping you alive with information.

81
00:11:25,097 --> 00:11:30,626
If you disregard my counsel and keep
running your business like this,

82
00:11:30,803 --> 00:11:35,172
with your balls and not your head,
two things will happen.

83
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,477
I'll quit, and you'll get killed.

84
00:11:50,856 --> 00:11:54,917
You forgot to tell me
about your scouting trip.

85
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:58,757
- No, I didn't.
- You made another contact. Who?

86
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:02,662
Castro always asked me
about my sources.

87
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:08,330
- I always gave him the same answer.
- Castro didn't pay you what I pay.

88
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:11,943
This one will cost you nothing.

89
00:12:13,412 --> 00:12:15,209
A woman.

90
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,679
You're using a woman.

91
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:27,590
It won't float.

92
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:31,762
- John, what do you want? Toast?
- Waffles!

93
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,457
- No time for waffles.
- Anybody seen my keys?

94
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:38,330
On the front hall table or in your pocket.

95
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:41,564
- Where are my keys?
- Pancakes!

96
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,267
- Toast, please!
- Thank you.

97
00:12:45,444 --> 00:12:48,572
- Bye, pal.
- Daddy. It won't float!

98
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:54,743
It's not supposed to float,
it's a submarine. It goes under water.

99
00:12:57,456 --> 00:12:59,481
Hello?

100
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:02,757
When?

101
00:13:05,197 --> 00:13:07,665
I thought I had the flu.

102
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:11,496
I'd still think so
if they weren't telling me otherwise.

103
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:17,201
What are they telling you?

104
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:23,337
Pancreatic cancer of an aggressive
nature, if I heard them right.

105
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:26,609
Well, what does it mean?

106
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,044
I guess it means I'm in big trouble.

107
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:35,250
- I mean, can they operate, or...?
- Maybe.

108
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:41,093
That's what they said, "maybe", which
sounds suspiciously like "no" to me.

109
00:13:41,266 --> 00:13:43,734
There's one of them now.

110
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:49,195
Hey, I'm not dead yet.

111
00:13:50,242 --> 00:13:55,544
I am in a hospital, which means
that I'm not in my office,

112
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:57,739
which means
I don't know what's going on.

113
00:13:58,383 --> 00:14:00,943
- I need you there.
- Where?

114
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:04,953
- In my office, doing my job.
- Wait...

115
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:08,615
I hate not knowing
what's going on, you know that.

116
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:11,695
I wouldn't know how to do your job, sir.

117
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:16,301
You've been around.
You've been to the White House.

118
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:20,097
- Once. I hated it.
- No, you didn't.

119
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:25,332
Want to know about politics
in Washington? Four words...

120
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,239
"Watch your back, Jack. "

121
00:14:33,285 --> 00:14:38,746
Bobby, you should be the first to know,
or the third or fourth...

122
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:42,121
Ryan is to be acting
Deputy Director of Intelligence.

123
00:14:42,294 --> 00:14:47,755
It will be a provisional appointment,
of course, until James recovers.

124
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:51,596
You brief him
on our aid programme to Colombia.

125
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:56,673
He has to talk the Oversight Committee
out of another 75 million dollars.

126
00:14:56,842 --> 00:15:00,209
And not make a complete fool
out of himself.

127
00:15:02,314 --> 00:15:04,475
What about the Hardin murders?

128
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,245
I'm on it. The President's calling
for a full-court press.

129
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,414
So, you guys are going to be
working together hand in hand.

130
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:16,558
That's great.

131
00:15:31,977 --> 00:15:34,309
Margaret...

132
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:38,381
- Why don't we leave all his things?
- OK.

133
00:15:50,395 --> 00:15:53,262
Ryan. I can't believe it!

134
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:57,129
He's not a team player,
is that what you're saying?

135
00:15:57,302 --> 00:15:59,236
He's a Boy Scout.

136
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:05,768
A goddamn Boy Scout. Believes in
loyalty, cleanliness and knot-tying.

137
00:16:05,944 --> 00:16:08,174
So leave him out of it.

138
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:12,249
He's the Deputy Director of
Intelligence. That will be tricky.

139
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:15,011
What does he need to know?

140
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:21,148
Nothing. He needs to know nothing.
He's going to know nothing.

141
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,458
I want a copy
of the President's authorisation

142
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:27,621
of this new action against the cartels.

143
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:32,262
- You want what?
- You heard me.

144
00:16:33,672 --> 00:16:35,196
He doesn't know about it.

145
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:43,272
Let me explain it to you very simply.
This is your deal. Not mine.

146
00:16:43,548 --> 00:16:48,576
Unless I have written authorisation,
this thing is over before it begins.

147
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:53,817
I'm not going to be the only one left
without a chair when the music stops.

148
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:38,160
Reciprocity. That's a clever name for it.

149
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:42,534
Revenge is a very, very,
very dangerous motivation.

150
00:17:44,476 --> 00:17:50,381
Are you able to handle this operation
or not? I'm looking for a yes or no.

151
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:53,518
You're looking for a political mess.

152
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:56,483
- Yes or no?
- Is that what they want?

153
00:17:56,655 --> 00:18:01,115
They want what every first-term
administration wants. A second term.

154
00:18:02,661 --> 00:18:05,858
I don't imagine the boys on the Hill
have approved this.

155
00:18:11,703 --> 00:18:13,398
Have they?

156
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:17,508
Is that a "no"?

157
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,845
Shit.

158
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:31,819
I want the money in my account
before I move an inch.

159
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,289
- You got it.
- I need a ComSat link.

160
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,792
- An insertion team.
- Have a brigade.

161
00:18:37,963 --> 00:18:42,525
I don't want a brigade. Just 12 men
who understand discretionary warfare.

162
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:46,501
- Special Ops people, Spanish-speaking.
- Cutter will get the military.

163
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:56,207
- How are you today, sir?
- Very well.

164
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:59,544
- The purpose of your visit?
- Business.

165
00:18:59,718 --> 00:19:02,448
- What business are you in?
- I sell tractors.

166
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:04,521
I build them, then I sell them.

167
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:10,050
- And how long will you be staying?
- A few days.

168
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:41,586
I know it's a risk,
but what's the alternative?

169
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,390
Zapping a retina with 6,000 rads
of cobalt? Not a pretty picture.

170
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:49,591
Prettier than a tumour
spreading in the cranial sack.

171
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:51,793
What is her name?

172
00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:57,671
Listen... Hungry?

173
00:19:57,842 --> 00:20:01,938
- Starved.
- We could forget about lunch.

174
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:06,914
- We did that last time, remember?
- Do I remember? Do you?

175
00:20:08,753 --> 00:20:12,450
- Vaguely.
- Maybe I should refresh your memory.

176
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:17,819
- Maybe you should.
- Your table is ready now.

177
00:20:17,996 --> 00:20:20,988
- We don't need it. I'll get a cab.
- Moira?

178
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:26,661
- Hi! How are you? How's Jack?
- He's great, just great.

179
00:20:26,838 --> 00:20:29,830
- You still with the FBl?
- The Director's office.

180
00:20:30,008 --> 00:20:32,602
- Who was that?
- My new friend.

181
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:35,746
Señor Roberto Landa.

182
00:20:35,914 --> 00:20:39,975
- Doesn't he look like Jack?
- Does he? I can't quite see.

183
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:44,713
- Only Latin.
- A Latin Jack? This I have to see.

184
00:20:45,757 --> 00:20:48,225
I have to go. Bye.

185
00:20:50,195 --> 00:20:54,655
Well, we know it's not piracy.
Pirates steal boats.

186
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:59,827
They had plane tickets to Bogota
the morning after the killings.

187
00:21:00,005 --> 00:21:01,597
- Hey, Dan.
- How's it going?

188
00:21:01,773 --> 00:21:05,140
We're sneaking up on a motive.
Dan Murray, FBl.

189
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:08,211
- Ralph Williams, DEA.
- Said anything yet?

190
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,783
- Yeah, "We're innocent. "
- Till the D.A. offers them a deal.

191
00:21:12,951 --> 00:21:16,409
He already has. Regular or extra crispy.

192
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:19,887
Either referring to fried chicken
or the electric chair.

193
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:22,785
Are you picturing a hit?

194
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:27,364
On a respectable American
businessman and his family?

195
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:31,030
You're assuming he's respectable.

196
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:45,178
We have memos,
letters, credit card statements...

197
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:50,720
...phone bills, everything
you could need to break his code.

198
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:54,017
- What's this?
- Old high school yearbook.

199
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:58,185
- Sweethearts, football team...
- You think?

200
00:21:58,363 --> 00:22:03,062
- I don't know.
- OK, let's see what we've got.

201
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:05,566
- No cream?
- There wasn't any.

202
00:22:06,338 --> 00:22:10,331
Let's start with birthdays.
Bet your ATM code is your birthday.

203
00:22:10,508 --> 00:22:13,500
- Close.
- In reverse?

204
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,580
All right, his birthday is...

205
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:24,454
That would be too easy, wouldn't it?
Try it in reverse.

206
00:22:24,622 --> 00:22:27,250
No. His wife's?

207
00:22:28,393 --> 00:22:29,985
No. His son's?

208
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:32,425
- This could take...
- Months.

209
00:22:32,597 --> 00:22:34,497
Son's in reverse. This is for you.

210
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:40,160
No. Wife's in reverse.

211
00:22:40,338 --> 00:22:42,397
No. Daughter's in reverse.

212
00:22:42,574 --> 00:22:45,566
You've got to change your ATM code.

213
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:54,449
I got it!

214
00:22:54,886 --> 00:22:56,649
I got it!

215
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:11,128
Wife's birth month,
daughter's day, son's year.

216
00:23:11,302 --> 00:23:14,169
But not in reverse. Sorry.

217
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:24,844
Print me out that one, will you?

218
00:23:25,016 --> 00:23:27,109
Good boy.

219
00:23:27,285 --> 00:23:31,847
Three years ago, Hardin received
a large infusion of foreign money,

220
00:23:32,023 --> 00:23:37,256
which he invested wisely
in 20 major shopping centres in the US.

221
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:41,889
I say wisely because in the middle of
the recession, he posted record profits.

222
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:46,435
At least to the IRS, who he apparently
feared more than his own partners.

223
00:23:46,604 --> 00:23:49,300
According to the figures he gave them...

224
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:54,205
...the shopping centres
weren't doing so well.

225
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:58,975
But he was just skimming most of
the profits, 650 million dollars,

226
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:03,109
and putting it in numbered accounts
in Luxembourg, Panama

227
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:08,225
and the Cayman Islands.
They killed him for it.

228
00:24:08,393 --> 00:24:10,224
Who?

229
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:13,660
- His partners.
- Who were his partners?

230
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:20,328
It seems clear that he was laundering
money for the Colombian drug cartels.

231
00:24:20,505 --> 00:24:26,535
Jesus... I knew the man for 40 years.
We went to school together.

232
00:24:27,178 --> 00:24:29,772
We almost went into business together.

233
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:33,008
That would have been good.

234
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:37,077
The press is going
to have a field-day with this.

235
00:24:37,255 --> 00:24:41,919
- No one outside this room knows.
- They will. They always do.

236
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:46,996
It will come out, you're right about that.
And when it does, we'll...

237
00:24:47,165 --> 00:24:52,000
...downplay your relationship
with Hardin somehow.

238
00:24:54,105 --> 00:24:55,800
- What?
- What?

239
00:24:55,974 --> 00:24:59,705
- We'll defuse it.
- Do you disagree?

240
00:24:59,878 --> 00:25:01,641
No.

241
00:25:01,813 --> 00:25:06,750
Well, actually, yes.
I would go in the other direction.

242
00:25:06,918 --> 00:25:11,981
If a reporter asked if you and Hardin
were friends, I'd say "good friends".

243
00:25:12,156 --> 00:25:16,889
If they asked if you were good friends,
I'd say "lifelong friends".

244
00:25:17,061 --> 00:25:22,624
Give them no place to go,
nothing to report. No story.

245
00:25:24,802 --> 00:25:29,671
I mean, it's no sense in
defusing a bomb after it's already...

246
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:33,637
...it's already gone off.

247
00:25:57,068 --> 00:25:59,332
- Damn.
- Shit.

248
00:26:00,638 --> 00:26:01,969
Do you see him?

249
00:26:03,241 --> 00:26:07,041
All right. Move your team
two metres to the left.

250
00:26:10,548 --> 00:26:13,346
That's it. Stop.

251
00:26:13,518 --> 00:26:17,545
Touch that light-coloured grass.
Sniper at your feet.

252
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,682
Nothing here, Sergeant Major.

253
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:23,958
- Damn!
- He is good.

254
00:26:40,945 --> 00:26:45,075
That was close.
How's he moving so fast?

255
00:26:49,954 --> 00:26:53,890
I see him. Come in.
Straight in. Now. Run!

256
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:57,519
Keep coming.

257
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:03,294
To your left. To your left.

258
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:08,062
And stop. Sniper at your feet.

259
00:27:10,074 --> 00:27:11,507
What is it?

260
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:17,037
He had lunch here.

261
00:27:18,282 --> 00:27:23,219
McDonald's quarter-pounder
with cheese.

262
00:27:23,688 --> 00:27:26,122
Damn.

263
00:27:31,262 --> 00:27:34,197
- Damn!
- That's four.

264
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:38,967
All right, you won this one.
Come on out!

265
00:27:40,838 --> 00:27:43,932
Soldier, how did you get
that close to me?

266
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:49,444
Sniper approached instructor by being
a sneaky bastard, Sergeant Major!

267
00:27:49,614 --> 00:27:53,778
Do you know the fine for littering
in California, Chavez?

268
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:56,215
Yes, sir!

269
00:27:58,856 --> 00:28:02,587
I saw you on the sniper course.
You looked good.

270
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,287
- Just about finished here, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

271
00:28:06,464 --> 00:28:10,230
Looking forward to taking
some leave with your wife and kids?

272
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:15,103
- Don't have any wife or kids, sir.
- What do you have?

273
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:22,570
You don't call anybody often,
you don't write or receive many letters.

274
00:28:25,383 --> 00:28:27,943
Who are you, sir, if I may ask?

275
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:32,681
Mr Clark and I are putting together
a mission. My team is a part of it.

276
00:28:33,424 --> 00:28:37,793
You'll be gone up to six months,
after which, if you're not dead,

277
00:28:37,962 --> 00:28:41,591
you'll have a choice
of assignments in Special Ops.

278
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:02,852
...defusing an issue that was
snowballing into another scandal.

279
00:29:03,621 --> 00:29:07,819
The New York Times is reporting that
you and Hardin were good friends?

280
00:29:07,992 --> 00:29:12,122
No, not good friends.
We were lifelong friends.

281
00:29:12,296 --> 00:29:16,164
I said that. I said that.

282
00:29:18,302 --> 00:29:20,065
I told him to say that.

283
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:24,505
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

284
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:28,167
- But you were thinking something.
- No.

285
00:29:28,346 --> 00:29:32,680
I was just distracted by the trouble
you were having with your ensemble.

286
00:29:34,285 --> 00:29:39,052
Well, it's not every day
you have to look trustworthy.

287
00:29:39,223 --> 00:29:42,556
- Who told who to say what?
- It's not important.

288
00:29:44,095 --> 00:29:46,996
- The President?
- Yeah.

289
00:29:47,165 --> 00:29:51,363
Mom says she makes more money
than the President.

290
00:29:51,536 --> 00:29:54,505
She's probably right. Bye.

291
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:07,379
Thank you, Dr Ryan,
for the information you've shared with us.

292
00:30:08,486 --> 00:30:11,751
- Thank you, Senator.
- We must help the Colombians

293
00:30:11,923 --> 00:30:16,417
in their struggle to curtail
the drug cartels' activities.

294
00:30:16,594 --> 00:30:22,897
However, I'm confused.
How do you see additional funds alone

295
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:25,900
advancing this programme
from the failure that it is?

296
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:30,370
- You see what I'm getting at?
- No, I'm afraid I don't.

297
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:33,942
You said this effort would be
totally benign on our part.

298
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:39,139
The finding clearly states our assistance
is limited to supply and advice only.

299
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:40,716
I've read that.

300
00:30:40,885 --> 00:30:45,686
I've also read a similar finding
written 35 years ago

301
00:30:45,857 --> 00:30:49,953
regarding a little-thought-of
sliver of jungle in south-east Asia.

302
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:56,327
Sorry, you're comparing our request
for anti-drug funds to Vietnam?

303
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,493
I'm comparing it to every time
a committee such as this is asked

304
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:05,108
to render judgement
based on less than all the facts.

305
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:11,012
I'm afraid I don't know
what to say to that.

306
00:31:11,182 --> 00:31:14,379
You could assure us
we've been given all the facts.

307
00:31:14,552 --> 00:31:16,383
I thought I had.

308
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:21,958
You could further assure us, then,
that this increase in funds

309
00:31:22,126 --> 00:31:25,527
will not be used for
any covert military action.

310
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:29,561
I don't know how you're getting to this.

311
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:32,897
Long experience, sir.

312
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,765
No troops, then?

313
00:31:34,939 --> 00:31:40,809
I enunciate that clearly because
I don't want there to be any mistake.

314
00:31:40,978 --> 00:31:42,502
No troops.

315
00:31:43,581 --> 00:31:46,414
You could say I have your word on that?

316
00:31:46,584 --> 00:31:49,144
You could indeed, because you do.

317
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:11,331
Listen up! Dog tags...
Take them off, pass them forward.

318
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:17,209
Check your pockets for anything
that can be used for identification.

319
00:32:25,156 --> 00:32:26,487
We're feet dry.

320
00:32:40,538 --> 00:32:43,701
Landing zone in sight. Get ready.

321
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:46,741
Good luck, boys. Go get 'em.

322
00:32:50,681 --> 00:32:52,842
OK, let's take her down now.

323
00:34:39,957 --> 00:34:41,288
Hey, Bob.

324
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:46,025
- How you doing?
- Good, sir.

325
00:34:47,364 --> 00:34:49,161
Good to see you.

326
00:34:55,272 --> 00:34:58,673
- Morning, Jack.
- Ryan! Come on in.

327
00:34:59,343 --> 00:35:01,607
- Do you know everyone?
- Yes, yes.

328
00:35:01,779 --> 00:35:04,976
- Coffee? Bagel?
- Coffee. Black, please.

329
00:35:06,183 --> 00:35:09,584
- How's the family?
- Good, sir.

330
00:35:09,753 --> 00:35:13,120
- When do I meet the other Dr Ryan?
- She's dying to meet you, sir.

331
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,349
Good, good. Sit down.

332
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:26,331
- The cash is still there?
- Sir?

333
00:35:26,504 --> 00:35:30,668
- In Hardin's off-shore accounts.
- 650 million dollars.

334
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:33,002
- And change.
- And change...

335
00:35:33,177 --> 00:35:36,613
- And we have the account numbers.
- Yes, sir.

336
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:42,082
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's get it.

337
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:46,314
Let's turn this thing around.
650 million dollars and change.

338
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:50,017
It's worth ten times that
in political capital.

339
00:35:52,496 --> 00:35:55,124
What?

340
00:35:55,299 --> 00:36:02,762
Well... This connection between
Hardin and the cartels is a theory.

341
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,340
- Theory?
- A theory of mine.

342
00:36:05,509 --> 00:36:09,377
- It's a theory?
- Well, I know the money is there.

343
00:36:09,547 --> 00:36:14,211
But who exactly Hardin
was working for, I don't know.

344
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:19,982
I think we would have to establish
that before we could seize the money.

345
00:36:22,993 --> 00:36:26,087
So go down there. Establish it.

346
00:36:26,263 --> 00:36:28,731
- Go where?
- Colombia.

347
00:36:30,935 --> 00:36:33,233
Who, me?

348
00:36:36,774 --> 00:36:41,541
I leave you alone for two weeks,
and you walk into a big bear trap.

349
00:36:41,712 --> 00:36:43,703
I don't know what I was thinking.

350
00:36:43,881 --> 00:36:50,184
You were thinking about impressing
the President. You shouldn't do that.

351
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:53,653
- November.
- January.

352
00:36:53,824 --> 00:36:55,587
Of last year.

353
00:36:58,729 --> 00:37:03,291
There's a guy down there,
at least used to be... Clark.

354
00:37:04,268 --> 00:37:06,702
We go way back. Good man.

355
00:37:07,304 --> 00:37:09,795
If you hit a brick wall, look him up.

356
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:13,276
Admiral Greer?

357
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:17,471
- Chemotherapy.
- Oh, shit.

358
00:37:17,648 --> 00:37:20,014
Here we go again.

359
00:37:21,252 --> 00:37:23,618
How's Ritter behaving?

360
00:37:23,787 --> 00:37:27,484
Ritter's Ritter. He's leaving me alone.

361
00:37:27,658 --> 00:37:31,856
Are you sure? Watch him like a hawk.

362
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:34,520
- How are you feeling today?
- OK.

363
00:37:34,698 --> 00:37:40,227
We'll get you in a room, give you
warm blankets, get you lying down.

364
00:37:40,404 --> 00:37:45,706
And then we'll get you back
to your room and get you comfortable...

365
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:41,694
Variable, this is Knife,
stand by to copy, over.

366
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:47,698
Variable, this is Knife,
stand by to copy, over.

367
00:38:47,871 --> 00:38:51,898
Knife, this is Variable,
your signal is five by five, over.

368
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:57,314
Clear.

369
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:23,097
The chicken is in the pot. Over.

370
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:27,939
- Cook it.
- Roger that.

371
00:39:44,695 --> 00:39:48,290
Honey? I'm late.

372
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:51,894
Have a good trip.

373
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,966
I'm not gonna say it.

374
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,108
Don't.

375
00:39:58,275 --> 00:40:00,505
Be careful.

376
00:40:27,938 --> 00:40:34,502
Local time is, well, actually, it's
the same as Washington, 11:16 a. m.

377
00:40:34,678 --> 00:40:38,170
Temperature is
69 degrees Fahrenheit...

378
00:40:44,788 --> 00:40:47,052
Doctor Ryan!

379
00:40:56,433 --> 00:40:59,994
DEA Special Agent Jean Fowler.
How you doing?

380
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,297
- First time in Bogota?
- Yeah.

381
00:41:02,473 --> 00:41:07,035
Let's not stand here
and let someone take a shot at you.

382
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:27,096
- And these two?
- They're brothers.

383
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:34,229
Don't do that. Give Dr Ryan
a bit more air back here, please.

384
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:36,304
Bulletproof.

385
00:41:43,847 --> 00:41:47,647
We don't have a picture.
Escobedo's intelligence officer.

386
00:41:48,185 --> 00:41:50,813
We don't have a name either,
but we know he exists.

387
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:54,753
The invisible man?

388
00:41:55,592 --> 00:41:58,152
Gently, gently. With your hands.

389
00:41:58,328 --> 00:42:01,491
Luis, put your hands together.

390
00:42:02,366 --> 00:42:05,164
No, your hands together!

391
00:42:08,205 --> 00:42:10,901
Luis, watch the canter!

392
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:15,001
Yes, very good!

393
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,050
We lost another plane.

394
00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:36,822
- Who is doing this?
- If I had to guess...

395
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,561
No, I did not ask you to guess.
I can guess.

396
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:44,434
Someone's been talking
to the drug police.

397
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:49,341
Impossible. If anyone spoke to the
police, I'd be the first to know.

398
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:51,538
Ernesto!

399
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:58,278
Is one of the others trying to ruin me,
after what I did to the American?

400
00:42:58,455 --> 00:43:03,984
I guess that wasn't quite
the deterrent you thought it would be.

401
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:06,129
Find out who it is.

402
00:43:14,371 --> 00:43:16,601
What do you make of this, Colonel?

403
00:43:18,241 --> 00:43:19,902
An opportunity.

404
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:24,639
An opportunity, Sipo.

405
00:43:39,029 --> 00:43:42,362
- Good afternoon.
- Messages, please?

406
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:48,638
- Dr Ryan?
- Clark? Sorry I'm late.

407
00:43:48,805 --> 00:43:51,069
I've got ten minutes.

408
00:43:53,443 --> 00:43:57,709
I'm positive Hardin was tied into
the cartels. It's drug money.

409
00:43:57,881 --> 00:44:01,476
- But you can't prove it.
- So far.

410
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,587
- Mind if I ask you a question?
- No.

411
00:44:06,757 --> 00:44:12,992
Why are you telling me all this?
I've been out of the game for a long time.

412
00:44:15,032 --> 00:44:20,299
I was told that you were wired in,
that you knew the town, the people.

413
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:23,962
- That you were a player.
- Who told you that?

414
00:44:25,842 --> 00:44:27,332
Jim Greer.

415
00:44:29,813 --> 00:44:31,144
How's he doing?

416
00:44:34,284 --> 00:44:36,684
He's not good.

417
00:44:38,121 --> 00:44:40,112
It's cancer.

418
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:42,315
Terminal.

419
00:44:44,528 --> 00:44:48,191
- He's a good man.
- The best.

420
00:44:55,005 --> 00:44:57,337
You a coffee drinker, Dr Ryan?

421
00:45:00,711 --> 00:45:04,477
- Yeah, I like coffee.
- Try the Lindo brand.

422
00:45:04,648 --> 00:45:08,015
- Lindo?
- I think you'll like it.

423
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:17,558
Mr president, I've got some good news.

424
00:45:17,728 --> 00:45:24,292
Hardin's partner here was someone
you may know of. Ernesto Escobedo.

425
00:45:24,468 --> 00:45:28,268
- Figures.
- Is this another of your theories?

426
00:45:28,972 --> 00:45:34,774
No, sir. We can call this one fact.
Escobedo, like every drug lord here,

427
00:45:34,945 --> 00:45:40,315
also had legitimate businesses.
Hardin was doing business with them.

428
00:45:40,917 --> 00:45:45,786
Importing among other things,
coffee, which means nothing,

429
00:45:45,956 --> 00:45:52,452
but he was paying too much for
this coffee. 6,200 dollars a pound.

430
00:45:52,629 --> 00:45:56,156
- That's expensive coffee.
- I'd have to agree.

431
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:59,166
This is good news. I think this does it.

432
00:45:59,803 --> 00:46:03,239
Sir, I also have some other news
which is not so good.

433
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:05,733
Oh, God...

434
00:46:05,909 --> 00:46:12,007
The DEA feels that the government
here would want the seized funds.

435
00:46:12,182 --> 00:46:17,051
- Or at least a large portion.
- This is our money.

436
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:21,020
- We found it.
- We could try telling them that.

437
00:46:21,191 --> 00:46:24,592
Try? Tell them.
Or don't tell them, I don't care.

438
00:46:25,228 --> 00:46:29,460
- Sir, with all due respect...
- This is our money, tell them that.

439
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:34,696
I wouldn't know what to say
or where to start, I'm not a negotiator.

440
00:46:34,871 --> 00:46:37,169
Don't you know someone there?

441
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:40,070
I went to school
with their Attorney General.

442
00:46:40,243 --> 00:46:44,873
Jacobs will come down.
He'll negotiate. This is our money.

443
00:46:46,049 --> 00:46:47,607
Thank...

444
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:50,616
Thank you.

445
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:56,725
I hate this job.

446
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:16,065
Eyes up!

447
00:48:18,441 --> 00:48:20,409
Demo Team, up!

448
00:48:27,517 --> 00:48:29,781
Fire in the hole!

449
00:48:34,257 --> 00:48:38,125
Let's go, let's go!
Move out! Go, go, go!

450
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:01,646
Whoever did this is dead.

451
00:49:03,253 --> 00:49:07,815
Whoever did this to me is dead!

452
00:49:07,991 --> 00:49:13,361
Do you hear me?
Are you listening to me?

453
00:49:27,644 --> 00:49:31,410
Mr Jacobs, could you sign these
before you leave?

454
00:49:32,615 --> 00:49:37,985
Moira... Why don't you
call in sick tomorrow?

455
00:49:38,154 --> 00:49:41,487
And the next day. I won't tell anybody.

456
00:49:41,658 --> 00:49:44,354
Even when you're not here,
there's plenty to do.

457
00:49:45,095 --> 00:49:48,724
- Your itinerary.
- You're arguing with me about this?

458
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:53,830
You work too hard. Adios.

459
00:50:32,442 --> 00:50:35,275
- Landa & Landa.
- Roberto Landa, please.

460
00:50:35,445 --> 00:50:40,109
- This is Moira Wolfson.
- One moment, please.

461
00:50:40,283 --> 00:50:43,912
I think he's on the factory floor.

462
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:52,728
- Yes?
- A Moira Wolfson is calling.

463
00:50:54,097 --> 00:50:59,160
I told her you were
on the factory floor. Go ahead.

464
00:50:59,335 --> 00:51:02,566
- Moira...!
- Hi.

465
00:51:02,739 --> 00:51:07,802
You free the next couple of days?
I am.

466
00:51:08,511 --> 00:51:13,073
My boss is leaving the country.

467
00:51:13,249 --> 00:51:18,346
- Can I call you later?
- All right, call me at home. Bye.

468
00:51:27,063 --> 00:51:33,161
Good afternoon.
Good news in the fight against drugs.

469
00:51:33,336 --> 00:51:37,067
An investigation
by the Department of Justice

470
00:51:37,674 --> 00:51:42,236
has identified several
bank accounts, from Luxembourg

471
00:51:42,412 --> 00:51:46,212
to the Cayman Islands,
used for laundering drug money

472
00:51:46,382 --> 00:51:51,684
on an unprecedented scale.
Working with five foreign governments,

473
00:51:51,855 --> 00:51:55,552
we have taken action
to seize those funds,

474
00:51:55,725 --> 00:51:59,320
which amount to
over 650 million dollars.

475
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:01,088
Oh, shit.

476
00:52:01,264 --> 00:52:05,792
Also to seize 20 real estate
joint venture investments in the US

477
00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:11,771
which were the primary agencies
in the laundering operations.

478
00:52:11,941 --> 00:52:15,638
You did say 650 million dollars?

479
00:52:15,812 --> 00:52:19,646
That's right.
650 million dollars. And change.

480
00:52:19,816 --> 00:52:22,046
They're stealing my money!

481
00:52:22,218 --> 00:52:27,713
- What's our take?
- It's hard to say at the moment.

482
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:32,453
No, it isn't. You're stealing my money.
I made it, you're stealing it!

483
00:52:33,163 --> 00:52:38,931
Mr president, can we speak with
FBl Director Jacobs about this?

484
00:52:39,102 --> 00:52:42,902
- Jacobs is not available.
- Someone will die for this.

485
00:52:43,072 --> 00:52:48,977
He's personally involved in this
investigation and is pretty busy.

486
00:52:59,856 --> 00:53:04,054
This avenue has to be avoided.
They'll be coming from the airport.

487
00:53:04,227 --> 00:53:08,823
Up Avenida Aeropuerto El Dorado
all the way to Gran America.

488
00:53:08,998 --> 00:53:13,264
Santa Fe's our spot.
As much as I'd love to be here for this,

489
00:53:13,436 --> 00:53:19,397
I have to take care of some business
in Washington, tying up loose ends.

490
00:53:28,284 --> 00:53:31,583
Hello? Don't hang up, don't hang up.

491
00:53:33,723 --> 00:53:37,921
- Hello?
- The machine is still on, Moira.

492
00:54:10,493 --> 00:54:14,691
- Emil, good to see you.
- Good to see you, Andy.

493
00:54:14,864 --> 00:54:19,324
- Agent Murray, Ambassador Ferris.
- Hi, good to see you.

494
00:54:19,502 --> 00:54:24,132
- This will bring you up to date.
- All right, let's go.

495
00:54:37,353 --> 00:54:42,017
- How's the food?
- It's like Mexican food.

496
00:54:42,191 --> 00:54:45,422
- You hate Mexican food.
- I hate Mexican food.

497
00:55:21,631 --> 00:55:23,997
- Hi.
- Hello.

498
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:29,104
All my secretary knows about America
is what she reads in people magazine.

499
00:55:29,272 --> 00:55:32,673
- How's the place?
- Come inside and find out.

500
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:43,583
It's... awful.

501
00:55:45,488 --> 00:55:47,251
Isn't it?

502
00:56:11,047 --> 00:56:13,345
So I take it you shouldn't
drink the water?

503
00:56:15,451 --> 00:56:18,909
They put water in your room,
but I'd stick to the bottled stuff.

504
00:57:09,605 --> 00:57:12,574
So, what do you brush your teeth with?

505
00:57:12,742 --> 00:57:17,145
Use the bottled water,
or you'll be in the can all your time here.

506
00:57:24,887 --> 00:57:29,449
The hold-up was
a government connection?

507
00:58:09,499 --> 00:58:11,091
Hey, what the hell?

508
00:58:21,978 --> 00:58:23,809
Back up! Back up!

509
00:58:30,086 --> 00:58:32,384
- Step on it!
- Stay down. Stay down.

510
00:58:42,832 --> 00:58:44,163
Watch out!

511
00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:48,996
Damn it! Back up!

512
00:58:52,675 --> 00:58:55,667
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Take it easy, Andy.

513
00:58:56,178 --> 00:59:00,012
Got to keep moving. Go, Jack!

514
00:59:16,032 --> 00:59:17,363
Incoming!

515
00:59:57,473 --> 00:59:59,566
Dan!

516
01:00:30,306 --> 01:00:32,137
Dan! Dan!

517
01:00:42,985 --> 01:00:45,579
We can't stay here!

518
01:00:47,723 --> 01:00:50,123
The car! Is it running?

519
01:00:50,292 --> 01:00:52,260
It's running!

520
01:00:52,428 --> 01:00:57,365
The smoke will give us cover.
It's our only chance. I got him.

521
01:00:57,533 --> 01:01:00,400
Make for the driver's side. Ready? Go!

522
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:14,381
- Get in!
- Go! Go!

523
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:20,210
Housekeeping.

524
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:32,117
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.

525
01:02:41,837 --> 01:02:45,273
- You have a call for Dr Ryan?
- Just a moment.

526
01:02:45,441 --> 01:02:52,142
...in the streets of Bogota today.
Ten were killed and eight wounded.

527
01:02:52,314 --> 01:02:56,148
Five of the dead
were security personnel...

528
01:02:56,318 --> 01:02:59,981
- Cathy?
- Don't tell me you're in this.

529
01:03:01,423 --> 01:03:05,189
Right in the middle of it.
Honey, Dan was killed.

530
01:03:06,128 --> 01:03:07,459
Dan Murray.

531
01:03:10,766 --> 01:03:13,963
He was 10 feet away.
There was nothing I could do.

532
01:03:16,438 --> 01:03:19,464
- I'm coming home.
- Thank God.

533
01:03:19,642 --> 01:03:21,940
I love you.

534
01:03:26,949 --> 01:03:30,316
- I thought his going there was a secret.
- It was.

535
01:03:30,486 --> 01:03:35,150
- Then I don't get it. What happened?
- Nobody knows.

536
01:03:35,324 --> 01:03:39,727
- How stupid are these people?
- They believe they can do anything.

537
01:03:39,895 --> 01:03:42,921
You know what? They're wrong.

538
01:03:43,098 --> 01:03:45,430
- Yes, sir.
- They're wrong.

539
01:03:47,403 --> 01:03:52,500
They've directly challenged the
sovereign power of the United States.

540
01:03:53,442 --> 01:03:55,967
No more sending messages.

541
01:03:56,145 --> 01:04:00,241
He wants them to get the message
whether the phone rings or not.

542
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:05,479
- Those are his words?
- Do they sound like his words?

543
01:04:05,654 --> 01:04:09,954
He can't be clear
when clarity is what he wants to avoid.

544
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:13,185
What he means is the gloves come off.

545
01:04:30,779 --> 01:04:35,807
I'm telling you,
I had nothing to do with it.

546
01:04:35,985 --> 01:04:39,216
I wish I had done it,
they deserved it. But it wasn't me.

547
01:04:39,388 --> 01:04:42,585
Who did then?

548
01:04:42,758 --> 01:04:46,694
You know, you have no answers.

549
01:04:48,397 --> 01:04:51,764
Is this the way it was with Castro?
No answers?

550
01:04:51,934 --> 01:04:54,926
- You don't want to hear an answer.
- Yes, I do.

551
01:04:57,373 --> 01:05:01,139
It was done to look like you did it.
By one of the others.

552
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:05,508
As you suspected.
It's always a friend who hates you most.

553
01:05:05,681 --> 01:05:07,615
Give me the phone.

554
01:05:14,757 --> 01:05:17,157
- Rojas.
- Did you do this thing?

555
01:05:17,326 --> 01:05:23,322
Did I do this thing? Are you calling
to ask me if I did this thing?

556
01:05:23,499 --> 01:05:27,128
You don't consult with us.
You put us in danger.

557
01:05:28,504 --> 01:05:32,463
And now you want me to believe
it wasn't you?

558
01:05:32,641 --> 01:05:34,233
It wasn't, Enrique.

559
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:37,777
The Americans will
retaliate against us all.

560
01:05:37,947 --> 01:05:41,212
I swear I had nothing to do with it.

561
01:05:41,383 --> 01:05:45,444
Why do you expect me
to listen to these lies?

562
01:05:45,621 --> 01:05:48,146
- Goodbye, Ernesto.
- No, no, no!

563
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:51,320
Don't hang up.
We must have a meeting.

564
01:05:51,493 --> 01:05:54,428
- When?
- As soon as possible.

565
01:05:57,766 --> 01:06:03,068
Tomorrow night. I am not
telling you, I am asking you!

566
01:06:03,238 --> 01:06:08,141
- May we meet tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow afternoon.

567
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,508
- He's scared.
- He should be.

568
01:06:40,676 --> 01:06:43,440
I don't know what you said,
but it was right.

569
01:08:16,672 --> 01:08:18,196
Strange, don't you think?

570
01:08:18,373 --> 01:08:22,332
Jacobs and his secretary
getting killed on the same day.

571
01:08:24,213 --> 01:08:28,616
It wasn't his secretary.
He was a member of the security.

572
01:08:28,784 --> 01:08:30,308
Who?

573
01:08:32,154 --> 01:08:36,955
- I don't remember his name.
- I'm talking about Moira.

574
01:08:37,726 --> 01:08:40,286
Moira, remember? Jacobs' secretary.

575
01:08:40,462 --> 01:08:44,228
I know Moira, honey.
What are you talking about?

576
01:08:49,605 --> 01:08:53,166
- She said he was a Latin Jack Ryan.
- He was.

577
01:08:53,342 --> 01:08:57,711
- That's what she called him.
- The point is, he's Latin.

578
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:03,284
Which connects her death and Jacobs'
beyond the fact they worked together.

579
01:09:03,452 --> 01:09:07,320
You saw somebody you think
is responsible for both killings?

580
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:11,951
She did.

581
01:09:14,096 --> 01:09:16,291
She did.

582
01:09:22,604 --> 01:09:25,698
I saw him from a distance. From behind.

583
01:09:25,874 --> 01:09:30,402
- Medium height, medium build, etc?
- Mind if I look at these?

584
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:34,845
Is that what the people
from the cabin said?

585
01:09:36,718 --> 01:09:39,551
Did you check out
these calls to Venezuela?

586
01:09:42,357 --> 01:09:44,257
Disconnected.

587
01:09:47,162 --> 01:09:50,393
- So you have no leads?
- Oh, I have a lot.

588
01:09:50,566 --> 01:09:55,060
A fictitious name on a register.
A stolen phoned-in credit card number.

589
01:09:55,237 --> 01:10:00,334
Two eyewitnesses, one of whom
saw a guy, but didn't see him...

590
01:10:00,509 --> 01:10:03,444
Excuse me,
could you play that again?

591
01:10:03,612 --> 01:10:05,637
Yes, sir.

592
01:10:05,814 --> 01:10:08,044
The machine is still on, Moira.

593
01:10:08,217 --> 01:10:11,015
You have a recording of the killer's voice.

594
01:10:11,987 --> 01:10:14,251
Maybe.

595
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:22,592
Jack. I think we've got something.
This is from the answering machine.

596
01:10:22,764 --> 01:10:27,292
And this was recorded yesterday.
I'll play it for you.

597
01:10:27,903 --> 01:10:29,393
OK.

598
01:10:31,573 --> 01:10:34,542
The machine is still on, Moira.

599
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:36,871
- All right.
- And...

600
01:10:37,045 --> 01:10:41,982
He's scared. I don't know
what you said to him, but it was right.

601
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:44,914
Kurt, run a match on that.

602
01:10:47,656 --> 01:10:53,254
He's Cuban. 35-45.

603
01:10:53,929 --> 01:10:58,389
Educated in the United States.
Eastern United States.

604
01:10:59,434 --> 01:11:02,301
- It's the same voice.
- You're sure?

605
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:03,995
- Yeah.
- How sure?

606
01:11:09,878 --> 01:11:11,539
90 percent.

607
01:11:13,015 --> 01:11:16,143
- I need a name.
- Could be hundreds of thousands...

608
01:11:16,318 --> 01:11:19,879
I know. I need a name,
and I need it quick.

609
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:40,665
300 is topside.

610
01:12:25,153 --> 01:12:27,417
Target is set.

611
01:12:29,758 --> 01:12:32,921
- Hector!
- Enrique!

612
01:12:33,795 --> 01:12:36,286
Good to see you!

613
01:12:36,465 --> 01:12:38,831
- It was not easy.
- Enrique, how are you?

614
01:12:39,401 --> 01:12:43,269
Rojas, Diaz...

615
01:12:46,341 --> 01:12:48,309
What the hell is this?

616
01:12:48,477 --> 01:12:51,378
What the hell is this?

617
01:12:53,148 --> 01:12:56,117
My new toy. Like it?

618
01:12:56,818 --> 01:12:58,649
You see this?

619
01:12:59,187 --> 01:13:03,681
That's your new target,
unless it's not big enough.

620
01:13:08,597 --> 01:13:12,158
Variable, this is Easy Rhino.
Do you copy? Over.

621
01:13:13,034 --> 01:13:15,400
Loud and clear, Easy Rhino.

622
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:19,506
- Do we have a gig?
- That's a rog.

623
01:13:25,347 --> 01:13:26,712
Target is lit.

624
01:13:28,517 --> 01:13:30,144
Start the music.

625
01:13:31,486 --> 01:13:33,044
Into attack.

626
01:13:34,489 --> 01:13:39,324
Target is acquired and lit.
Coming down.

627
01:13:43,765 --> 01:13:50,796
Fernandez, Vega...
Looks like a full house.

628
01:13:59,881 --> 01:14:02,748
Damn it! Why doesn't he fix this road?

629
01:14:03,852 --> 01:14:07,083
Shit! Thought we had everybody.

630
01:14:07,956 --> 01:14:10,254
Keep the target painted.

631
01:14:38,787 --> 01:14:40,550
Sir?

632
01:14:46,027 --> 01:14:47,358
Boom.

633
01:14:56,438 --> 01:14:57,769
Mother of God!

634
01:15:02,611 --> 01:15:04,772
Circular error probability zero.

635
01:15:04,946 --> 01:15:08,677
Impact with high order detonation.
Have a nice day.

636
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:18,987
The man is completely out of control.
He has no...

637
01:15:21,329 --> 01:15:25,026
The man is completely out of control...

638
01:15:27,769 --> 01:15:31,102
His name is Cortez, Felix Cortez.

639
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:35,804
A colonel in Cuba's intelligence
service until a few years ago.

640
01:15:35,977 --> 01:15:40,914
Turned up working for the Macheteros
terrorist group in Puerto Rico.

641
01:15:41,082 --> 01:15:47,282
Disappeared again. Yesterday we taped
him talking to a Cali cartel subject.

642
01:15:47,455 --> 01:15:52,017
I'll fax what I've got.
If he shows, pick him up, OK?

643
01:15:52,193 --> 01:15:55,959
- You know I can't do that.
- I mean the police.

644
01:15:56,131 --> 01:16:00,295
The Colombian police don't pick up
members of the cartel.

645
01:16:00,468 --> 01:16:03,995
Unless they've got a death wish.
You've been down here.

646
01:16:05,206 --> 01:16:06,969
Wait a minute.

647
01:16:07,475 --> 01:16:10,774
Oh Jesus...
Jack, something's happened here.

648
01:16:23,925 --> 01:16:28,624
At least 30 people were killed,
including women and children.

649
01:16:28,797 --> 01:16:33,234
The bomb exploded in a car
belonging to a Rojas associate.

650
01:16:33,401 --> 01:16:37,269
- Jack...?
- Yeah, are you watching this?

651
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:39,930
- Did this just happen?
- Just now.

652
01:16:43,578 --> 01:16:47,912
Send me all the stuff,
and we'll put a tail on him if we spot him.

653
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:51,214
If he's still alive. I've got to go.

654
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:59,316
- A surgical strike, you said.
- It was perfect.

655
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:03,658
- That's a dead kid. On NBC.
- Take the gloves off, you said.

656
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:07,495
- I know what I said.
- A bit late to change your mind.

657
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:09,933
I'm not changing my mind.

658
01:17:10,572 --> 01:17:14,406
I hadn't counted on
this kind of collateral damage.

659
01:17:15,844 --> 01:17:18,870
- Neither had he.
- It will be interpreted as I said.

660
01:17:19,047 --> 01:17:22,778
Rivalry that ended
in the blast of a car bomb.

661
01:17:22,951 --> 01:17:24,282
Goodnight.

662
01:17:39,601 --> 01:17:43,833
- Morning, Rose. Finish the report?
- Hot off the press.

663
01:17:46,708 --> 01:17:50,735
Could any of the bombing victims'
names be aliases?

664
01:17:51,212 --> 01:17:55,774
No. All IDs have been confirmed.
Who are you hoping for?

665
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:59,647
If he's not here, he's not here.
Cortez. He's not here.

666
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:06,050
- Why was Operations copied on this?
- Ritter requested it.

667
01:18:07,262 --> 01:18:10,231
Ritter, huh? You look very nice today.

668
01:18:11,266 --> 01:18:13,063
Thank you.

669
01:18:27,015 --> 01:18:28,505
Car bomb...

670
01:18:38,226 --> 01:18:40,820
What happens
when a car bomb goes off?

671
01:18:40,995 --> 01:18:45,056
- It explodes.
- It blows up and out?

672
01:18:45,233 --> 01:18:47,633
And a missile?

673
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:53,564
- This deeper crater?
- That's characteristic.

674
01:18:53,742 --> 01:18:55,937
Bring up the satellite photo.

675
01:19:02,283 --> 01:19:05,741
HMX and TNT.

676
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,447
When you mix it 70/30,
you get a compound called Octol.

677
01:19:09,624 --> 01:19:12,718
Put enough explosives in a car,
you get a crater that big.

678
01:19:12,894 --> 01:19:17,661
- It's very stable. Very expensive.
- Would it still be in the crater?

679
01:19:17,832 --> 01:19:20,960
- Very violent.
- There would be pieces all around.

680
01:19:21,636 --> 01:19:28,542
- Where is Octol made?
- Lots of places. Europe. The US.

681
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:33,477
But nobody uses it.
Nobody can afford it except the military.

682
01:19:33,648 --> 01:19:38,915
An aerial bomb would do that.
But that's not an aerial bomb.

683
01:19:39,087 --> 01:19:40,418
- It's not?
- No.

684
01:19:40,588 --> 01:19:44,217
There is also
a cellulose residue on everything.

685
01:19:44,392 --> 01:19:47,589
There should be shrapnel.
Here and here.

686
01:19:47,762 --> 01:19:51,425
- But there isn't.
- No bomb fragments.

687
01:20:35,276 --> 01:20:39,713
"Cellulose encased laser-guided bomb"...

688
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:43,374
Paper.

689
01:20:47,722 --> 01:20:49,485
The Americans are here.

690
01:21:20,355 --> 01:21:24,553
We have something in common.
Neither of us can implement policy

691
01:21:24,726 --> 01:21:28,787
without at least tacit authorisation
from our employer.

692
01:21:28,963 --> 01:21:33,832
We also both know there are
American troops in Colombia

693
01:21:34,002 --> 01:21:36,596
fighting an illegal war.

694
01:21:38,072 --> 01:21:43,203
I will be at Hotel paloma de Oro
in panama City on Wednesday.

695
01:21:43,378 --> 01:21:45,005
I suggest we meet.

696
01:22:37,332 --> 01:22:41,393
- Six, this is point. Over.
- Six here.

697
01:22:42,737 --> 01:22:50,234
The stuff's here, a lot of it.
I'm also looking at 100-150 men, armed,

698
01:22:50,411 --> 01:22:53,209
waiting around for something. Over.

699
01:22:53,381 --> 01:22:55,906
Colombian Army? Over.

700
01:22:59,487 --> 01:23:02,888
Negative. They look like mercenaries.

701
01:23:03,057 --> 01:23:06,549
All right. Get back here. Abort mission.

702
01:23:06,728 --> 01:23:09,458
I say again, abort mission. Out.

703
01:23:11,332 --> 01:23:13,994
150 armed men, huh?

704
01:23:34,956 --> 01:23:36,651
Raise your arms, please.

705
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:56,343
Thank you for responding to my note.
And so promptly.

706
01:23:57,345 --> 01:24:01,213
I had nothing to do
with the death of Mr Jacobs.

707
01:24:01,382 --> 01:24:05,842
It was an act of madness. But
a typical one from the men I work for.

708
01:24:07,622 --> 01:24:11,524
- What do you want?
- Same as you. Mineral water.

709
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:17,420
Do we agree that as long as Americans
demand drugs, they will be supplied?

710
01:24:17,598 --> 01:24:20,192
I don't want to be here
longer than I have to.

711
01:24:20,368 --> 01:24:23,963
You mentioned a gang war.
What does that mean?

712
01:24:24,138 --> 01:24:28,700
- That we want the same thing.
- Really?

713
01:24:28,876 --> 01:24:33,813
So far you've done all the work.
You've taken care of the little fish.

714
01:24:33,981 --> 01:24:36,040
I will take care of the one that got away.

715
01:24:36,784 --> 01:24:41,778
Once Escobedo is gone,
I will be in a position to help you.

716
01:24:41,956 --> 01:24:46,154
- You want to help me?
- Your country. Your people.

717
01:24:46,327 --> 01:24:51,060
By restructuring the drug trade.
By regulating it.

718
01:24:52,433 --> 01:24:57,962
What would you say if I promised you
I'd halve cocaine shipments to the US?

719
01:24:59,607 --> 01:25:03,839
I'd say you'd been using
too much of your product.

720
01:25:04,011 --> 01:25:07,572
I can also give you regular quotas
on major arrests

721
01:25:07,748 --> 01:25:10,945
that your police can take credit for.

722
01:25:11,119 --> 01:25:14,816
Imagine. Dramatic seizures.
Drastic reductions.

723
01:25:14,989 --> 01:25:19,722
No more senseless violence.
You'll have your victory.

724
01:25:24,132 --> 01:25:25,724
In return for what?

725
01:25:27,034 --> 01:25:30,936
I also need a victory,
to establish my position

726
01:25:31,105 --> 01:25:35,769
with what is left of the cartel,
so I can help you.

727
01:25:36,511 --> 01:25:41,380
I need to defeat those soldiers
blowing up everything they see.

728
01:25:41,549 --> 01:25:47,317
Give me maps of their locations.
Cut off their communications.

729
01:25:54,362 --> 01:26:00,096
DEA's sending the audio
surveillance tape. I haven't got it yet.

730
01:26:02,737 --> 01:26:08,073
You know what you think about...
when you're lying here?

731
01:26:09,443 --> 01:26:12,606
You know you're gonna die,
and you think...

732
01:26:14,582 --> 01:26:19,315
...that's all right. You lived a long time.

733
01:26:19,487 --> 01:26:21,580
You had a family that loved you.

734
01:26:21,989 --> 01:26:26,289
You had a job that you thought
made a difference.

735
01:26:27,195 --> 01:26:29,993
That you thought was honourable.

736
01:26:30,965 --> 01:26:33,763
And then you see this.

737
01:26:37,772 --> 01:26:41,640
I'm afraid if I dig any deeper...

738
01:26:41,809 --> 01:26:44,403
...no one's gonna like what I find.

739
01:26:50,251 --> 01:26:53,584
You took an oath...

740
01:26:53,754 --> 01:26:55,847
...if you recall...

741
01:26:58,693 --> 01:27:02,220
...when you first came to work for me.

742
01:27:02,396 --> 01:27:08,130
And I don't mean to the National
Security Advisor of the United States,

743
01:27:09,337 --> 01:27:12,602
I mean to his boss.

744
01:27:12,773 --> 01:27:15,264
And I don't mean the President.

745
01:27:16,911 --> 01:27:20,210
You gave your word to...

746
01:27:21,816 --> 01:27:24,410
...his boss.

747
01:27:24,585 --> 01:27:27,179
You gave your word...

748
01:27:27,355 --> 01:27:31,815
...to the people of the United States.

749
01:27:33,094 --> 01:27:35,892
Your word is who you are.

750
01:27:41,168 --> 01:27:42,692
What else have you got there?

751
01:27:48,976 --> 01:27:52,036
I brought you some new magazines.

752
01:28:01,555 --> 01:28:07,391
The situation in East Timor seems
to have stabilised during the day.

753
01:28:07,561 --> 01:28:11,361
- Is that it?
- Except for the other thing.

754
01:28:12,833 --> 01:28:15,893
We've accomplished a lot,
we're seeing tangible results.

755
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:19,801
Drug shipments are down.
The price on the street is rising.

756
01:28:19,974 --> 01:28:24,411
The administration is perceived
to be doing something right.

757
01:28:24,578 --> 01:28:27,547
What's the bad news?

758
01:28:29,317 --> 01:28:34,949
I'm worried about the car bomb coming
so soon after Jacobs' assassination.

759
01:28:36,824 --> 01:28:39,554
Just the kind of thing reporters live for.

760
01:28:39,727 --> 01:28:43,857
- They'd love to make a connection.
- And you think they will?

761
01:28:45,299 --> 01:28:49,429
I think it's time
the whole thing went away.

762
01:28:49,603 --> 01:28:53,039
- If that's what you think.
- I think so.

763
01:28:55,109 --> 01:28:59,637
Then it should go away.
It never happened.

764
01:29:01,148 --> 01:29:03,116
Yes, sir.

765
01:29:04,618 --> 01:29:08,281
Well... it's possible.

766
01:29:08,456 --> 01:29:13,621
It would be easier if you told me whose
system you wanted me to break into.

767
01:29:13,794 --> 01:29:15,762
- Morning, Dr Ryan.
- Morning.

768
01:29:37,318 --> 01:29:40,048
We're way beyond birthdays now.

769
01:29:41,021 --> 01:29:45,481
I'm gonna have to write
a special program here.

770
01:29:56,270 --> 01:30:00,206
OK, sweetheart, let's get to work.

771
01:30:01,142 --> 01:30:03,042
Fine, good.

772
01:30:04,478 --> 01:30:08,209
Yes... Here we go.

773
01:31:05,539 --> 01:31:08,531
Reciprocity. What's that?

774
01:31:21,422 --> 01:31:24,289
I forgot to tell you,
after you get the code,

775
01:31:24,458 --> 01:31:29,327
wait until he's off his system
before you log on. He will know.

776
01:31:29,497 --> 01:31:31,863
Jesus, Petey, it's too late.

777
01:31:32,032 --> 01:31:34,432
Oh, my God...

778
01:32:05,065 --> 01:32:06,726
Cutter...

779
01:32:21,415 --> 01:32:25,749
- Bob, Jack Ryan here.
- Good morning, Jack.

780
01:32:26,253 --> 01:32:30,280
Listen, maybe we got off to a bad start.

781
01:32:31,058 --> 01:32:35,586
If we're gonna work together,
we should get to know each other.

782
01:32:35,763 --> 01:32:39,927
Do you play tennis?
Tennis? Do you play tennis?

783
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:44,503
- Yeah, I play tennis.
- How about we get together?

784
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:47,971
Next week?
Maybe an hour before we start work?

785
01:32:55,115 --> 01:32:57,174
- Jack?
- Yeah.

786
01:32:57,851 --> 01:33:02,345
Computer theft is a serious crime.

787
01:33:05,559 --> 01:33:08,858
So are crimes against the Constitution.

788
01:33:10,464 --> 01:33:12,523
Son of a bitch!

789
01:33:24,411 --> 01:33:26,402
Son of a bitch!

790
01:33:30,584 --> 01:33:31,983
Come on, come on.

791
01:33:35,289 --> 01:33:36,950
Clark...

792
01:34:13,193 --> 01:34:14,854
You're going to jail, pal.

793
01:34:16,397 --> 01:34:20,128
What is that?
What do you think you have there?

794
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:21,892
You broke the law.

795
01:34:23,103 --> 01:34:27,062
You are such a Boy Scout.

796
01:34:27,241 --> 01:34:30,642
Look at you.
You see everything in black and white.

797
01:34:30,811 --> 01:34:34,770
No, not black and white, Ritter.
Right and wrong!

798
01:34:34,948 --> 01:34:39,476
- You see! There you go again.
- Why was I kept out of it?

799
01:34:39,653 --> 01:34:42,918
You weren't, you're neck deep in it.
You went before Congress.

800
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:45,957
You got the money for it.
You lied under oath...

801
01:34:46,126 --> 01:34:50,927
- I never lied to Congress!
- You told them no troops.

802
01:34:51,098 --> 01:34:54,499
- There are troops!
- You know I didn't know that.

803
01:34:54,668 --> 01:35:00,334
No. I have no recollection of that.
That's the term you have to learn.

804
01:35:00,507 --> 01:35:04,534
- Who authorised this?
- Sure, they'll ask you that.

805
01:35:04,712 --> 01:35:09,445
- Who authorised this?
- I have no recollection... Senator.

806
01:35:14,588 --> 01:35:18,957
I did not sign up for somebody's
bullshit political agenda.

807
01:35:19,126 --> 01:35:23,085
Who authorised this? Cutter?

808
01:35:23,263 --> 01:35:26,755
Cutter couldn't tie his shoes
without permission.

809
01:35:31,205 --> 01:35:34,663
- If I go down, you're going with me.
- Wrong again.

810
01:35:34,842 --> 01:35:38,369
I have an autographed
"Get Out of Jail Free" card.

811
01:35:40,347 --> 01:35:44,647
"The President authorises
the Deputy Director CIA, Robert Ritter,

812
01:35:44,818 --> 01:35:50,256
"to conduct Operation Reciprocity
including all support necessary.

813
01:35:50,424 --> 01:35:56,988
"This operation is deemed important
to the national security of the US."

814
01:35:59,032 --> 01:36:03,526
You don't have one of these,
do you, Jack?

815
01:36:12,679 --> 01:36:17,707
Grey! The world's grey, Jack!

816
01:36:50,083 --> 01:36:55,180
You have any idea how I'm gonna
get out of this mess?

817
01:36:55,355 --> 01:36:58,449
Absolutely none.

818
01:37:07,134 --> 01:37:10,968
Yeah. This is he.

819
01:37:14,942 --> 01:37:16,637
When?

820
01:37:21,315 --> 01:37:23,510
James?

821
01:37:25,052 --> 01:37:27,282
Thank you.

822
01:37:27,454 --> 01:37:35,088
Admiral James Greer devoted his life
to his country and his family.

823
01:37:35,262 --> 01:37:39,392
Giving selflessly
of both his wisdom and his love.

824
01:37:40,634 --> 01:37:44,468
He served his country
for more than 50 years.

825
01:37:44,638 --> 01:37:49,837
Enlisting in the Navy at 17.
Graduating from the Academy.

826
01:37:50,010 --> 01:37:53,605
Achieving three stars for his flag.

827
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:57,511
He lived through tumultuous events
in his country's life.

828
01:37:57,684 --> 01:38:02,087
He participated in them.
He made them clearer to the rest of us,

829
01:38:02,256 --> 01:38:08,684
with his knowledge, his honesty,
his integrity and his courage.

830
01:38:17,838 --> 01:38:19,601
I can't see them, but I know they're there.

831
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:23,773
Five kilometres due east
from your position.

832
01:38:28,682 --> 01:38:32,209
Keep pushing forward. We'll trap them.

833
01:38:32,386 --> 01:38:35,685
Never was he deluded
into thinking that one man...

834
01:38:36,657 --> 01:38:39,091
...could solve the ills of the world.

835
01:38:39,259 --> 01:38:43,958
Always the soldier, on the battlefields
of the South Pacific, Korea...

836
01:38:44,131 --> 01:38:48,795
...Vietnam and Washington,
he fought as part of a unit...

837
01:38:49,436 --> 01:38:51,301
...to preserve the ideals...

838
01:38:51,471 --> 01:38:52,870
Knife, this is Variable.

839
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,940
...of his nation.

840
01:38:55,108 --> 01:38:58,077
Knife! This is Variable. Over.

841
01:38:59,046 --> 01:39:03,142
To the refuge of the earth,
we entrust our friend's body.

842
01:39:03,617 --> 01:39:08,020
To the protection of our God
in Heaven, we entrust his soul.

843
01:39:08,188 --> 01:39:12,750
To ourselves, we entrust his spirit...

844
01:39:12,926 --> 01:39:16,589
...and the principles he lived by.

845
01:39:16,763 --> 01:39:18,697
We're gonna miss you, James.

846
01:39:41,521 --> 01:39:43,182
Variable, this is Knife, over.

847
01:39:44,524 --> 01:39:47,618
Variable, this is Knife, over.

848
01:39:47,794 --> 01:39:51,286
Variable, I am not receiving.
We are under heavy attack.

849
01:39:51,465 --> 01:39:54,730
Need air support, over.

850
01:40:16,089 --> 01:40:19,786
Variable, this is Knife, over! Switch!

851
01:40:52,359 --> 01:40:56,352
Variable, this is Knife!
Where the hell are you?!

852
01:41:17,851 --> 01:41:22,254
On behalf of a grateful nation,
our condolences.

853
01:41:22,422 --> 01:41:25,619
- He was a very great patriot.
- Thank you.

854
01:42:04,364 --> 01:42:08,698
- Hello?
- Jean Fowler for Dr Jack Ryan.

855
01:42:08,869 --> 01:42:12,305
Jack? You've got to hear this.

856
01:42:12,472 --> 01:42:14,906
Picked it up this morning.

857
01:42:15,075 --> 01:42:21,036
Variable, this is Knife.
We are under attack, need air support.

858
01:42:21,214 --> 01:42:24,411
Variable, this is Knife,
where the hell are you?

859
01:42:25,085 --> 01:42:28,111
Jack, what do you want me
to do with this?

860
01:42:29,122 --> 01:42:33,684
Make a copy, Jean. Make ten copies.

861
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:36,795
Get them to me
as quick as you can. Thanks.

862
01:42:39,432 --> 01:42:43,766
Jesus. They're going to leave
those guys down there.

863
01:43:27,113 --> 01:43:32,949
He's on American 915.
He'll be in Bogota 7:50 p. m.

864
01:43:45,265 --> 01:43:47,165
- Yeah?
- It's Ritter.

865
01:43:47,334 --> 01:43:51,134
- Where the fuck have you been?
- We have a problem.

866
01:43:51,304 --> 01:43:54,034
We've got a disaster!
I can't get through to my men.

867
01:43:54,641 --> 01:43:57,940
We had to shut down the satellite link.

868
01:43:59,779 --> 01:44:02,145
- Clark?
- You had to what?

869
01:44:04,050 --> 01:44:10,011
It's Ryan. He found out everything.
He threatened to tell Congress

870
01:44:10,323 --> 01:44:13,258
if we didn't shut down the operation.

871
01:44:13,426 --> 01:44:18,955
OK. It's shut down. Just give me
some air and my men are out of there.

872
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:27,138
Clark, maybe you're not hearing me.
There is no air. We are shut down.

873
01:44:28,441 --> 01:44:32,002
I'm on a plane. I'm gonna kill him.

874
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,645
Ritter?

875
01:44:37,284 --> 01:44:39,718
He's coming to you.

876
01:44:40,153 --> 01:44:43,850
American Airlines at 19:50
with no security.

877
01:44:44,024 --> 01:44:48,586
- Who is this?
- National Security Advisor Cutter.

878
01:44:48,762 --> 01:44:51,322
Once Ryan's gone, we're back on line.

879
01:44:51,865 --> 01:44:53,696
You understand?

880
01:44:55,135 --> 01:44:57,262
Yes, sir.

881
01:46:18,318 --> 01:46:19,683
Clark...

882
01:46:19,853 --> 01:46:21,582
- Jesus!
- Get in the van.

883
01:46:21,755 --> 01:46:26,317
- Don't do this, I came to find you.
- You found me. Get in.

884
01:46:30,697 --> 01:46:32,392
Behind the wheel.

885
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:35,367
Clark...

886
01:46:36,836 --> 01:46:38,565
Drive.

887
01:47:06,566 --> 01:47:09,160
- Ritter.
- Ryan's dead.

888
01:47:11,237 --> 01:47:13,296
How?

889
01:47:13,473 --> 01:47:16,601
I killed him. Turn the satellite back on.

890
01:47:20,113 --> 01:47:24,880
You said get rid of Ryan
and we're back in business, right?

891
01:47:50,076 --> 01:47:52,101
What the hell are you doing here?

892
01:47:54,514 --> 01:47:57,677
I came to help you get those guys out.

893
01:47:59,319 --> 01:48:01,913
What can you do to help me?

894
01:48:07,594 --> 01:48:10,563
What do you need?

895
01:48:10,730 --> 01:48:12,095
A helicopter.

896
01:48:14,367 --> 01:48:16,335
A helicopter.

897
01:48:25,512 --> 01:48:26,843
No, thank you.

898
01:48:29,816 --> 01:48:32,876
- Is this "Happy Hour"?
- It's always "Happy Hour".

899
01:48:33,052 --> 01:48:36,715
- Your pilot owns this joint?
- He lives here.

900
01:48:42,562 --> 01:48:43,893
Here he is.

901
01:48:55,275 --> 01:48:59,871
Morning. I'm here to rent the Huey.

902
01:49:00,046 --> 01:49:04,176
Sorry, we don't rent it any more.
But it is for sale.

903
01:49:05,852 --> 01:49:07,717
How much is it?

904
01:49:09,122 --> 01:49:11,522
Two million dollars.

905
01:49:17,330 --> 01:49:19,958
My pilot and I would
have to do a test flight.

906
01:49:20,133 --> 01:49:23,102
Of course.
You just have to leave a deposit.

907
01:49:25,004 --> 01:49:26,835
How much is that?

908
01:49:27,006 --> 01:49:28,496
Two million dollars.

909
01:49:34,247 --> 01:49:37,182
Would you take a company cheque?

910
01:49:44,123 --> 01:49:45,613
Yes.

911
01:49:53,566 --> 01:49:57,263
- Here we go.
- Big son of a bitch, ain't she?

912
01:49:59,505 --> 01:50:03,771
- Do you have any time in this type?
- Nine o'clock.

913
01:50:13,853 --> 01:50:20,019
- Get out of my chopper.
- No. My chopper. Let's go.

914
01:50:40,546 --> 01:50:43,674
Their last communication put them here.

915
01:50:44,951 --> 01:50:50,014
The closest extraction point is here.
In this gorge.

916
01:50:50,923 --> 01:50:52,652
I got it.

917
01:51:12,612 --> 01:51:15,945
- Is that a body down there?
- Yes.

918
01:51:17,984 --> 01:51:21,511
- One of ours?
- One of mine.

919
01:51:25,058 --> 01:51:29,290
Find a place to set her down.
We'll look for the others.

920
01:52:12,939 --> 01:52:17,808
Nowhere to run to. No place to hide.

921
01:52:17,977 --> 01:52:23,677
Blood trails everywhere.
They all lead to the river.

922
01:52:36,295 --> 01:52:40,425
These are the falls we saw from the air.

923
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:44,195
The bodies should be
about 50 metres down.

924
01:52:56,516 --> 01:53:01,453
You left us!
You left us with no support at all!

925
01:53:01,621 --> 01:53:05,921
You left us out to dry!
You son of a bitch!

926
01:53:08,694 --> 01:53:12,130
- It's not his fault.
- Whose fault is it?

927
01:53:14,133 --> 01:53:15,464
It's my fault.

928
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:23,099
It's my fault.

929
01:53:35,188 --> 01:53:39,124
I was on point
when the last attack came.

930
01:53:40,126 --> 01:53:42,253
Over a mile away.

931
01:53:43,462 --> 01:53:45,794
By the time I got back it was over.

932
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:50,363
They were taken to Captain Rosso.

933
01:53:51,537 --> 01:53:54,267
The others?

934
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:56,135
I buried them.

935
01:54:05,251 --> 01:54:07,116
Road to the town.

936
01:54:07,286 --> 01:54:10,653
They loaded the prisoners here.
Blood everywhere.

937
01:54:10,823 --> 01:54:14,691
- God knows where they are now.
- Escobedo knows.

938
01:54:14,861 --> 01:54:18,160
What are you going to do?
Knock on his door?

939
01:54:24,804 --> 01:54:29,764
Morning. I'd like to see Ernesto
Escobedo. I don't have an appointment.

940
01:54:43,322 --> 01:54:45,153
OK.

941
01:54:47,226 --> 01:54:49,091
Hands up.

942
01:54:49,795 --> 01:54:51,956
Hands up!

943
01:54:53,299 --> 01:54:55,233
Wallet.

944
01:55:00,039 --> 01:55:01,666
It's a tape recorder.

945
01:55:06,412 --> 01:55:08,471
He's in.

946
01:55:11,884 --> 01:55:14,614
Bird, this is Variable, over.

947
01:55:16,355 --> 01:55:20,155
Bird, this is Variable, over.

948
01:55:36,542 --> 01:55:40,137
Dr Ryan... Come in.

949
01:55:54,126 --> 01:55:57,823
Sit down. What can I do for you?

950
01:55:59,231 --> 01:56:05,161
I didn't know who else to turn to.
I have a problem.

951
01:56:06,172 --> 01:56:09,869
An associate of mine,
a coffee buyer and his assistant

952
01:56:10,042 --> 01:56:12,840
were on a business trip in this area.

953
01:56:13,012 --> 01:56:16,743
They disappeared yesterday.
I'm very concerned.

954
01:56:16,916 --> 01:56:19,214
Coffee buyer?

955
01:56:19,385 --> 01:56:22,047
It's very important to me to find them.

956
01:56:22,221 --> 01:56:25,520
Coffee buying is becoming
a dangerous business.

957
01:56:26,826 --> 01:56:31,991
Yes. Well, it was for Peter Hardin.

958
01:56:34,467 --> 01:56:38,096
- Who?
- He was a client of Lindo Coffee.

959
01:56:38,270 --> 01:56:43,230
- Lindo Coffee has many clients.
- You must have heard of this one.

960
01:56:43,409 --> 01:56:46,970
He owed your company
a great deal of money.

961
01:56:47,146 --> 01:56:51,276
I'll have to talk to Accounting about that.

962
01:56:52,618 --> 01:56:54,984
650 million dollars.

963
01:56:58,124 --> 01:57:00,354
And change.

964
01:57:01,794 --> 01:57:07,061
Are you offering to help me
with the collection of an unpaid debt?

965
01:57:07,233 --> 01:57:10,134
- No.
- What are you offering?

966
01:57:11,604 --> 01:57:16,371
A trade. Felix Cortez has sold you out.

967
01:57:16,542 --> 01:57:20,808
He will murder you and your family,
and take over the cartel.

968
01:57:20,980 --> 01:57:22,845
Where's my tape recorder?

969
01:57:29,455 --> 01:57:31,252
Play the tape.

970
01:58:05,091 --> 01:58:06,786
Let's move.

971
01:58:36,722 --> 01:58:40,123
I'd like you to meet
my new friend, Dr Ryan.

972
01:58:40,292 --> 01:58:43,523
A doctor? Why? Is somebody sick?

973
01:58:57,143 --> 01:58:58,610
What does he want?

974
01:59:00,779 --> 01:59:04,306
The safe return of his associates.

975
01:59:04,483 --> 01:59:08,681
And what does he offer us in return?

976
01:59:08,854 --> 01:59:11,186
You.

977
01:59:17,129 --> 01:59:21,293
Whatever this man has told you is a lie.
He lies for a living.

978
01:59:21,467 --> 01:59:26,029
He's in the intelligence business.
You're in the intelligence business!

979
01:59:32,611 --> 01:59:35,444
You've taken care of the little fish.

980
01:59:35,614 --> 01:59:37,844
I'll take care of the one that got away.

981
01:59:38,384 --> 01:59:43,219
Once Escobedo is gone,
I'll be in a position to help you.

982
01:59:43,389 --> 01:59:47,519
So, the question is...

983
01:59:48,827 --> 01:59:51,159
...what am I supposed to do with you?

984
01:59:54,767 --> 01:59:57,531
I guess I'm supposed to
kill you with this bat!

985
02:00:06,445 --> 02:00:08,379
Get up.

986
02:00:13,085 --> 02:00:17,454
Dramatic seizures.
Drastic reductions, no more violence...

987
02:00:17,623 --> 02:00:19,716
You'll have your victory.

988
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:24,156
In return for what?

989
02:01:03,769 --> 02:01:05,703
- Where are they?
- They're here.

990
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:12,476
The American killed Ernesto! Let's go!

991
02:02:00,659 --> 02:02:02,889
Bird to Variable. Over.

992
02:02:16,342 --> 02:02:21,041
Bird, this is Variable.
Where the hell are you?

993
02:02:21,213 --> 02:02:24,808
I'm cruising about five klicks
south of the village.

994
02:02:25,584 --> 02:02:30,283
- Stay there. I'll get back to you.
- Roger that.

995
02:02:42,067 --> 02:02:44,501
- No one.
- The prisoners!

996
02:03:31,250 --> 02:03:33,980
Come on, guys. Let's go, son.

997
02:03:35,621 --> 02:03:37,486
We're going home, boys.

998
02:04:51,263 --> 02:04:53,823
Pick us up at the Lindo Coffee factory.

999
02:06:30,429 --> 02:06:34,422
Not only can I expose you
to the press, so can the soldiers.

1000
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:41,199
Do you want to take your chances
with the courts and the reporters?

1001
02:06:41,373 --> 02:06:45,400
To end the political career
of your commander-in-chief?

1002
02:07:29,988 --> 02:07:32,252
Let's go!

1003
02:07:59,551 --> 02:08:03,248
Get your asses in here!
Come on, we got to go!

1004
02:08:06,191 --> 02:08:09,319
Come on!

1005
02:08:14,933 --> 02:08:17,629
Hold it! We wait for Ryan!

1006
02:08:17,803 --> 02:08:19,327
Yeah? We're out of here!

1007
02:08:26,745 --> 02:08:29,680
Set it down! He's down there!

1008
02:08:42,294 --> 02:08:44,319
Come on!

1009
02:09:02,948 --> 02:09:04,575
I've got you!

1010
02:09:11,590 --> 02:09:13,615
Chavez, cover me!

1011
02:09:22,834 --> 02:09:24,859
Your hand. Give me your hand!

1012
02:10:31,970 --> 02:10:34,962
The President will see you now.

1013
02:10:47,285 --> 02:10:50,254
Jack! I'm glad you're here.

1014
02:10:51,723 --> 02:10:55,750
Sit down. Can I get you anything?

1015
02:10:55,927 --> 02:10:57,519
No.

1016
02:10:58,563 --> 02:11:02,863
- Come on, sit down.
- I would prefer to stand, sir.

1017
02:11:05,303 --> 02:11:11,469
Some things have gone on here
that I'm just becoming aware of.

1018
02:11:11,643 --> 02:11:15,875
I was kept in the dark, as you were,
for a very long time.

1019
02:11:16,047 --> 02:11:19,312
- Troubling things.
- Yeah.

1020
02:11:19,484 --> 02:11:23,818
Now we have to sort them out,
figure out who's responsible for what.

1021
02:11:23,989 --> 02:11:27,789
And what to do about it.
And we have to do it delicately,

1022
02:11:27,959 --> 02:11:30,792
otherwise people might
get the wrong idea.

1023
02:11:32,130 --> 02:11:33,461
We have to lie.

1024
02:11:35,567 --> 02:11:39,936
- Did I say that?
- No, you didn't.

1025
02:11:40,105 --> 02:11:43,734
- You're upset.
- I'm upset.

1026
02:11:43,909 --> 02:11:49,279
It's understandable. Do you mind
if I give you a bit of advice?

1027
02:11:49,447 --> 02:11:51,915
Of course, you know this. You're smart.

1028
02:11:52,083 --> 02:11:55,541
Never make important decisions
while you're upset.

1029
02:11:56,521 --> 02:12:01,891
You did. American soldiers and
innocent civilians are dead because of it.

1030
02:12:02,060 --> 02:12:06,258
- I never ordered any...
- Don't you play that game with me!

1031
02:12:06,431 --> 02:12:10,333
Do not dishonour their memories
by pretending you didn't know!

1032
02:12:10,502 --> 02:12:14,063
- How dare you lecture me!
- How dare you, sir!

1033
02:12:14,239 --> 02:12:18,369
How dare you come here and bark at me
like some little junkyard dog!

1034
02:12:18,543 --> 02:12:21,706
I am the President of the United States!

1035
02:12:25,750 --> 02:12:28,617
It gives me no pleasure to do it, sir.

1036
02:12:29,621 --> 02:12:32,749
As acting Deputy Director
of Intelligence, it is my duty

1037
02:12:32,924 --> 02:12:36,826
to report this matter
to the Senate Oversight Committee.

1038
02:12:41,866 --> 02:12:47,600
- You're not going to do that.
- I'm not?

1039
02:12:50,075 --> 02:12:53,841
You've got yourself
a chip in the big game now.

1040
02:12:55,280 --> 02:13:00,877
You're going to save that for a time
when your own ass is on the line.

1041
02:13:01,453 --> 02:13:04,445
And then you're going to pull it out.

1042
02:13:04,622 --> 02:13:08,820
And I'm going to cash it in for you.
Right?

1043
02:13:10,895 --> 02:13:14,331
I don't think I have anything more
to say to you, sir.

1044
02:13:15,734 --> 02:13:21,172
The country can't afford another
scandal, Jack. To protect itself,

1045
02:13:21,339 --> 02:13:27,039
it won't allow another deception
that goes all the way to the top.

1046
02:13:27,212 --> 02:13:31,205
You'll take the blame.
Cutter and Ritter will take some too,

1047
02:13:31,383 --> 02:13:34,614
but it will only amount to
a slap on the wrist.

1048
02:13:34,786 --> 02:13:38,779
Then 20,000 dollars an hour
on the lecture circuit.

1049
02:13:39,958 --> 02:13:44,054
The rest of the blame will fall on Greer.

1050
02:13:44,229 --> 02:13:47,926
Oh yeah, you'll take him down with you.

1051
02:13:48,099 --> 02:13:50,192
You'll destroy his reputation.

1052
02:13:50,802 --> 02:13:56,399
But that's as far as it will go.
The old Potomac two-step, Jack.

1053
02:13:59,344 --> 02:14:03,041
I'm sorry, Mr President, I don't dance.

1054
02:14:26,504 --> 02:14:28,597
Ryan, have you got a minute?

1055
02:14:28,773 --> 02:14:30,570
No.

1056
02:14:31,576 --> 02:14:34,374
We need to talk!

1057
02:14:34,546 --> 02:14:36,514
Ryan!

1058
02:15:00,805 --> 02:15:06,471
The Committee will come to order.
The chair will now call Dr John Ryan.

1059
02:15:27,398 --> 02:15:33,268
Dr Ryan, thank you for appearing
before the Committee today.

1060
02:15:34,072 --> 02:15:36,768
Please stand and raise your right hand.

1061
02:15:40,645 --> 02:15:44,604
Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony you're about to give

1062
02:15:44,782 --> 02:15:49,116
is the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1063
02:15:52,390 --> 02:15:54,324
I do.

1064
02:15:55,460 --> 02:15:59,692
Dr Ryan, you may consider yourself
under oath. Please be seated.
