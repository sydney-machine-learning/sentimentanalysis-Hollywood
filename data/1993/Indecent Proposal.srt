1
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:37,195
<i>Losing Diana was like</i>
<i>losing a part of me.</i>

2
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:42,698
<i>I thought nothing could change</i>
<i>the way we felt about each other.</i>

3
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,770
<i>I thought we were invincible.</i>

4
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:52,740
<i>Someone once said, "If you want</i>
<i>something very badly, set it free. "</i>

5
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,077
<i>"If it comes back to you,</i>
<i>it's yours for ever. "</i>

6
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:01,517
<i>"If it doesn't,</i>
<i>it was never yours to begin with. "</i>

7
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:06,655
<i>I knew one thing.</i>
<i>I was David's to begin with.</i>

8
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,784
<i>And he was mine.</i>

9
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,756
Light up my life...

10
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:19,538
<i>We met in high school. David was</i>
<i>a senior and I was a freshman.</i>

11
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:23,699
<i>After glee club, he'd drive me and</i>
<i>my best friend home from school.</i>

12
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,470
<i>I used to watch him</i>
<i>in the rear-view mirror.</i>

13
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,707
<i>I fell in love with his eyes.</i>

14
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,551
<i>When I was 19 David proposed to</i>
<i>me on the pier at Paradise Cove.</i>

15
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,456
<i>Our parents were against it.</i>

16
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,587
<i>They said we were too young,</i>
<i>we didn't know each other.</i>

17
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:51,429
<i>But David said that a life</i>
<i>without risk is like no life at all.</i>

18
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,039
<i>So we eloped.</i>

19
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:16,155
<i>I graduated from architecture school</i>
<i>and got a job at a small firm.</i>

20
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,595
<i>Diana helped support us</i>
<i>by selling real estate.</i>

21
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,268
<i>I spent all my free time</i>
<i>working on a design of my own.</i>

22
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,771
<i>It summed up everything about</i>
<i>architecture that really mattered</i>.

23
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,967
<i>It was my dream house.</i>

24
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,272
D?

25
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,371
Have I ever told you I love you?

26
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,713
No.

27
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,287
- I do.
- Still?

28
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,188
Always.

29
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,958
<i>We had our differences.</i>

30
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:28,898
<i>He'd take his clothes off and leave</i>
<i>them on the floor. It made me crazy.</i>

31
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,616
What do you think this is?
Leaving your shoes on the table?

32
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,594
- I don't need to do your laundry.
- I'll pick it up. Don't get violent.

33
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,665
- What about this?
- Now, you put that down.

34
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,894
- You're gonna hurt somebody.
- I'm gonna hurt somebody?

35
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,335
You're outta your mind!

36
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,667
OK, now. Fine.

37
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,745
Goddamn it!

38
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,940
Now, come on. Let's just relax.

39
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,415
- Did I hurt you?
- No. I'm all right.

40
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:23,511
- I'm sorry.
- Really? You were kidding?

41
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,566
D, your pants are on fire.

42
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,793
You have no idea.

43
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,885
<i>We had no money, so for entertainment</i>
<i>David showed me architecture he liked.</i>

44
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,084
<i>But sometimes I'd have to ask,</i>

45
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,924
<i>"Why are we looking at</i>
<i>a stupid car wash?"</i>

46
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,397
<i>And he'd just say, "No, not stupid."</i>

47
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,162
<i>"Don't just use your eyes."</i>

48
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,295
<i>He made me look at things</i>
<i>differently.</i>

49
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:53,010
David, this is a steal. It just came in.
Nobody knows about it yet.

50
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,408
It's beautiful.

51
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,209
Build a house here.
You'd make a name for yourself,

52
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,877
because the house will be brilliant,
being by David Murphy.

53
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,320
<i>I found an incredible piece of property</i>
<i>in Santa Monica, by the ocean.</i>

54
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,222
<i>It was the perfect site</i>
<i>for David's house.</i>

55
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,158
We'll borrow the money.

56
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:14,426
These leverage stockbroker buyout
guys, you should see the junk they buy.

57
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,730
They would go crazy
for a house of yours.

58
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,705
<i>It was brilliant, even though</i>
<i>I didn't understand a word of it.</i>

59
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,037
<i>We had to economise</i>
<i>for the loan payments,</i>

60
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,204
<i>but it was our future</i>
<i>and I got to build my house.</i>

61
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,714
<i>And then the recession hit.</i>

62
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:40,993
<i>The real-estate market dried up.</i>
<i>I hadn't closed a sale in six months.</i>

63
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,493
<i>Construction fell to its lowest point</i>
<i>in years.</i>

64
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,156
<i>People were being laid off everywhere,</i>
<i>and I was one of them.</i>

65
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,100
- I feel really bad about this.
- I don't understand. What happened?

66
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,172
The bank has called in
the demand note.

67
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,797
Can they do that?

68
00:07:55,942 --> 00:08:00,436
You don't have any income right now,
so they could attach your assets.

69
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,577
What assets?

70
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,281
Your house.

71
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,689
Gotta keep up those payments.

72
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,256
I'm sorry.

73
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,134
David, I'm scared.

74
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:38,281
We don't have any money.
What are we gonna do?

75
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:47,252
I'll wait tables or drive a cab
or something. I don't know.

76
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,765
I'll take care of you.

77
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,338
Make it go away.

78
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:14,214
<i>I was desperate.</i>
<i>We stood to lose everything:</i>

79
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:17,948
<i>The house I'd been building,</i>
<i>even our own home.</i>

80
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,890
<i>I swallowed my pride and borrowed</i>
<i>$5,000 from my father.</i>

81
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,724
<i>It wasn't enough.</i>

82
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,389
<i>We needed $50,000.</i>

83
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,740
- D...
- What?

84
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:46,375
- Get up. Get dressed. I got an idea.
- What time is it?

85
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,641
Hi! How ya doin'?

86
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,718
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, my God!

87
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,847
Oh, honey!
That's the spirit!

88
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:30,019
Keep 'em coming! 50,000 of 'em,
that's what we want! We're winners!

89
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,030
Put some money in the kitty!

90
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:49,044
We got a shooter now, folks.
A lucky lady shooter.

91
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,843
Stack it, don't rack it.

92
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,943
And I have a lovely...

93
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,671
Why don't you put it on?
It suits you.

94
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,771
Well, I can't afford it.

95
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:05,115
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

96
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:14,817
I really think you ought
to have the dress. Let me buy it for you.

97
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,793
You wanna buy me this dress?

98
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,693
Yeah.

99
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,499
- Why?
- I've enjoyed watching you.

100
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,934
You've earned it.

101
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,901
No, I haven't.

102
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:36,112
The dress is for sale. I'm not.

103
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,691
Roll 'em now, girlfriend!

104
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,111
I can't lose. I'm up over $9,000.

105
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,354
$9,000 up! This is my wife D.

106
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,755
These are my girls.
They're gonna be moving in.

107
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,027
Kiss 'em.

108
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,931
- Yeah.
- Bets, please.

109
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,081
- Did I ever tell you I love you?
- No.

110
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,478
- I do.
- Still?

111
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,017
Always.

112
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,568
5,000.

113
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:12,871
This little pile here, you guessed it.
Five more, D.

114
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,742
What do you think this is?
Five more.

115
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:20,909
Play with it. Roll around with it.
Enjoy yourself. Oh, my!

116
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,652
And the grand total is...

117
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,861
...$25,040.

118
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,195
So we're halfway there, like in an hour.

119
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:42,103
I figure about two hours tomorrow,
we'll be home free.

120
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,708
Come here.

121
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,686
What?

122
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,599
I love you.

123
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,734
I know that.

124
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,667
No, I mean even without the money.

125
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,526
Last call for wagers. No more bets.

126
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,236
Come on, black, come on.
Here we go.

127
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,536
Yes!

128
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:13,786
No more bets, please.

129
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,698
Yes, we won!

130
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,687
$4,100.
We said we wouldn't go below $5,000.

131
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,095
Do you want any more coffee?

132
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,168
No, thank you.

133
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,448
Tails we quit. Heads we go for it.

134
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,306
Two out of three.

135
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,710
Last call for wagers.

136
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,340
No more bets.

137
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:48,681
OK. I'm feeling lucky.
I say we put it on red.

138
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,687
All of it. Red.

139
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,757
I feel red. Do you feel red, D?

140
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,794
We can do this, huh?

141
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:05,399
I'm gonna put it on.
I'm putting it on red.

142
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,501
OK.

143
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,328
- No, it's black.
- What are you doing?

144
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,830
- It's black.
- What are you doing?

145
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:43,105
No, it's red.
Go with your instinct. Right?

146
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,439
- No more bets.
- Come on, man.

147
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,340
Gotta get it.

148
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:55,512
OK, come on red, come on red.

149
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,621
Too late, young lady.

150
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,303
Place your bets.
Bank side, player side.

151
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,738
All set? Cards, please.

152
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:56,109
Turning for the players.

153
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,009
Passes to the right, please.

154
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:05,320
Player draws nothing.

155
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:17,200
And set.

156
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,905
Player side, banker side.

157
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:25,575
- Who's that guy?
- That's John Gage.

158
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:29,306
He's a damn billionaire.
That's a rich son of a bitch right there.

159
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,076
He's down over
a million dollars already.

160
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,777
You see them little gold things
he's playing with?

161
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,218
$10,000 apiece.

162
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,553
Every time he lays one down,
10,000 big ones.

163
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:45,356
Look how cool he is. He must get more
pussy than you can shake a stick at.

164
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:49,092
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
- Player wins.

165
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,725
It's about time.

166
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,532
- Y'all married?
- Yeah.

167
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:59,133
- Stick around and gamble a little.
- Excuse me! Excuse me.

168
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,709
Would you mind lending me your wife?
Is that your wife?

169
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,249
Excuse me?

170
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,022
- For luck.
- Well, you'd have to ask her.

171
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,421
- May I?
- Go for it.

172
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,792
I don't think it's a good idea.
We should go.

173
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,229
- Just for a moment?
- I'll go.

174
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:25,666
Go ahead. It might be fun.
What have we got to lose?

175
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:28,773
- Well?
- Go and see what happens.

176
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,172
- Yeah, go ahead.
- We'll be here, backing you up.

177
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,670
Thank you.

178
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,805
See if you can get
a little of that money from him.

179
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:41,476
Do you think she'll ever come back?

180
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,088
I'm just bullshittin' you.

181
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:49,523
Have a seat.
I've been losing all day long.

182
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:53,791
Then you appeared and I won
my first hand. You brought me luck.

183
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,400
I'd say that's a sign.

184
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,503
Wouldn't you?

185
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,739
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

186
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,936
Candy?

187
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,777
Place your bets.

188
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,680
100,000.

189
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,213
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

190
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,090
- Not like that.
- Sorry.

191
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,899
All bets set? Cards, please.

192
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,904
Turning for the players.

193
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,444
Now, what we want...

194
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:45,575
What we need... is a nine.

195
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:53,756
We don't like that.

196
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,852
Player draws nothing.
Cards for the bank, please.

197
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,794
Bank's the winner with a natural eight.
Pay the bank.

198
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:07,502
I guess I'm not so lucky after all.

199
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:11,439
- Do you like cards?
- Not especially.

200
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:15,206
Wish I'd asked you sooner. Dice?

201
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,574
Yeah, I guess.

202
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:25,116
- Sam.
- Mr G?

203
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:28,420
One.

204
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,028
Excuse me, Mr G.

205
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,431
- Maybe I should go.
- This shouldn't take too long.

206
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,135
- What?
- This.

207
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,483
Now...

208
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,955
I hope you find this interesting.

209
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,249
Pit. Tadross.

210
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,920
Yes, sir. It's here now.

211
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:19,702
- Goes for one million dollars.
- It's a bet.

212
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,508
Here you are, Mr G.
One million dollars.

213
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,705
Bet it all.

214
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:20,134
Coming out. Crap eleven or any seven
this time. It is a come-out roll.

215
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,205
How much goes, now? Get 'em down.

216
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,365
Pick two.

217
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,843
Now just throw a seven.

218
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,950
If you wanna throw an eleven,
that's all right too.

219
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,425
Aren't you forgetting something?

220
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,549
Winner!

221
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,257
Think I oughta quit now?

222
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,463
I think I should.

223
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,567
Credit my account.

224
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:36,643
Sweetie, that was incredible.
Unbelievable.

225
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,942
Hi. John Gage.

226
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,917
- Hi. David Murphy.
- Hi, David.

227
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,250
Congratulations.
This is my wife Diana. I guess you met.

228
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,587
- Hi. Diana?
- Diana.

229
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,891
Thank you both. Very generous of you,
David. Are you staying at the hotel?

230
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:56,364
- No. Actually we're just leaving.
- Yes, we're on our way out.

231
00:28:56,501 --> 00:29:00,631
No, don't do that. We gotta celebrate.
Let me arrange a room for you here.

232
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,833
- That's very nice, but...
- No, I insist.

233
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:06,944
Please. It's the least I can do. OK?

234
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,070
Really, just sign for it.
Anything you want.

235
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,911
There's some lovely shops
off the lobby.

236
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,643
Have you seen 'em?

237
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:18,678
Let's go.

238
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,293
How about that?

239
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,900
Wow.

240
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,976
D, what do you think?

241
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:43,142
Godfather?

242
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,385
You won a million dollars today.

243
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:55,152
- He won it.
- Honey, you won it for him.

244
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,797
This feels nice.

245
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,534
Don't get it. Just stay right here.

246
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,334
OK.

247
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,619
Hello. William Shackleford.

248
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:24,017
Hi. David Murphy.

249
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,454
For Mrs Murphy. From John Gage.

250
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,691
Well, thank him for us.

251
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,199
I'll do that. Mr Gage is hosting a
gathering tonight in his suite at nine.

252
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:40,236
If you can find the time in your
schedule, he'd be most pleased.

253
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,608
- Look what you got.
- What?

254
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,304
Gift from Gage.

255
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,570
Really?

256
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:53,877
Well, open it up.

257
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,624
That's $5,000.

258
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,460
How do you know that?

259
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,093
I saw it in the store downstairs.

260
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,371
- Lucky for him you like black.
- Yeah.

261
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:57,432
No past, no future. Just check
in to a hotel and start all over again.

262
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:03,245
I just stick 'em under the sheets...

263
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:06,748
That's strange, am I right?

264
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:15,222
- In another life, have a good time.
- Thanks.

265
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:30,598
Who is that guy Shackleford?

266
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,370
Someone who works for me.

267
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,809
Someone I trust.

268
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,716
He killed someone once.

269
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:50,293
Tell me, where do you see
yourself in, say, ten years?

270
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,594
Well, I wouldn't mind being
a billionaire like yourself.

271
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,959
Nice shot. I mean beyond money.

272
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,663
What would satisfy you completely,
let you sleep well?

273
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,272
Are you saying you're not satisfied?

274
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,602
Who is?

275
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,641
I am.

276
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,645
She mean it?

277
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,118
I hope so.

278
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:21,146
Well then, you may not have won
in Vegas, but you're a lucky man.

279
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,317
I got money, I got security,
I have businesses,

280
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:27,227
but you have something
that I just don't have.

281
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,300
I guess there's limits
to what money can buy.

282
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,531
Not many.

283
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:36,166
Well, some things aren't for sale.

284
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:39,166
Such as?

285
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:42,511
Well, you can't buy people.

286
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:46,577
That's naive, Diana.
I buy people every day.

287
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:51,017
In business, maybe, but not
when real emotions are involved.

288
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:54,556
What are you saying?
You can't buy love? Isn't that a cliché?

289
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,988
- It's absolutely true.
- Is it?

290
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,030
What do you think?

291
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,998
- I agree with Diana.
- You do?

292
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,632
Well, let's test the cliché.

293
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:17,146
Suppose I were to offer
you one million dollars...

294
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:24,081
...for one night with your wife?

295
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,353
I'd assume you're kidding.

296
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,725
Let's pretend I'm not.
What would you say?

297
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,364
He'd tell you to go to hell.

298
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,507
I didn't hear him.

299
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,871
I'd tell you to go to hell.

300
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,290
That's a reflex answer
because you view it as hypothetical.

301
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:07,488
But let's say that
there were real money behind it.

302
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,467
I'm not kidding.

303
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:16,130
A million dollars. The night would pass,
but the money could last a lifetime.

304
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:19,104
Think of it.

305
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,541
A million dollars.

306
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:27,447
A lifetime of security, for one night.

307
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,979
And don't answer right away,
but consider it.

308
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,922
Seriously.

309
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,594
We're positive, OK?

310
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,164
Then you've answered my question.

311
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:49,467
And you've proved your point.
There are limits to what money can buy.

312
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:54,271
It's late and I hate to admit it,
but I have a meeting.

313
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,539
May I have one dance?

314
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,479
Of course, with your permission.

315
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,778
I think you'd better
get on to that meeting.

316
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:04,080
You don't want to miss out
on your next billion.

317
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,521
Understood.
I wouldn't part with her either.

318
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,957
Goodnight.

319
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,984
Can't sleep?

320
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,820
No.

321
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,259
Me neither.

322
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,536
I just keep thinking about it.

323
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,603
It's so weird, isn't it?

324
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,544
Yeah.

325
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:46,586
David, I think you want me to do it.

326
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,525
What are you talking about?

327
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,757
Don't be ridiculous.

328
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,200
Maybe we should just talk about it.

329
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,898
Well, I don't want you to do it.

330
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,412
- But you'd let me do it.
- No.

331
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,051
Why? Do you wanna do it?

332
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,723
No.

333
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,433
But I would. I'd do it for you.

334
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,628
For me?

335
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,973
I can't believe we're even
talking about this.

336
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:55,255
Think about what this money could do
for us, what it could do for our future.

337
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,560
You could finish your house.

338
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:04,828
You could pay your dad back.
Get rid of our debts.

339
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,097
After all, it wouldn't mean anything.

340
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,401
It's just my body.

341
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:15,137
It's not my mind.
It's not my heart.

342
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:21,774
You think we could
do something like that?

343
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,558
We both slept with other people
before we were married, right?

344
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,094
Yeah.

345
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:37,589
So we just have to look at it like that.

346
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:45,034
I slept with Bubba Aruzio! If I can
do that, I can sleep with anyone.

347
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:48,543
- You slept with Bubba?
- You knew.

348
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:51,204
No, I didn't know that. When?

349
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,879
When you were off sleeping
with that slut Olivia Daigle.

350
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,821
- Olivia Deagle. And she wasn't a slut.
- Excuse me. Olivia Beagle.

351
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,425
I do love you.

352
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,255
- She wasn't a slut.
- Yes, she was.

353
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,660
No, she wasn't...

354
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,028
...unfortunately!

355
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,565
Thank God we can laugh about it.

356
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,607
Yeah.

357
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:22,075
That's easy to say now. After...

358
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,652
We just have to forget
it ever happened.

359
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,983
And never discuss it. Not even once.

360
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,424
Because nothing will have happened.

361
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,168
Nothing that matters, anyway.

362
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:59,011
We have a brilliant script. Very special.

363
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:02,482
It's a comeback vehicle for Diana Ross.

364
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,078
And Billy Ray Cyrus.
Kind of "A Star is Born"...

365
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,521
So your first screenplay
sold for half a million.

366
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:11,560
- Shoulda been two.
- Except our lawyer caved in on us.

367
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,222
- That won't happen again.
- We're gonna get a lawyer that's tough.

368
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:19,097
Someone that'll step on
his grandmother for us.

369
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:23,304
Mr Green. A David Murphy
wants to speak to you urgently.

370
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,101
Put him on the speaker.

371
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:28,006
This is an old college buddy.
It'll only take a second.

372
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:31,342
- <i>Jeremy?</i>
- Davey, I'm in a meeting. What's up?

373
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,712
<i>Listen, we need you to close a deal.</i>

374
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:36,342
- What kind of deal?
- <i>A very big deal.</i>

375
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,387
Big deal. Go on.

376
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:43,619
<i>We're in Vegas at the Hilton. We met</i>
<i>John Gage. You know who he is?</i>

377
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:49,199
Sure I know who he is. He's
a billionaire. And a major poon hound.

378
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,595
<i>He is?</i>

379
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,031
Go on.

380
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:55,866
- <i>He offered us a million dollars.</i>
- A million dollars?

381
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:58,839
For what? Your kidneys?

382
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,945
<i>For one night with Diana.</i>

383
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,914
What do you mean? One night? Like...

384
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:10,350
<i>Yes.</i>

385
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:17,016
Could you excuse me for a second?

386
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:24,129
Let me get this straight.

387
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:29,365
He offered you a million dollars for a
night with your wife? Your wife Diana?

388
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:34,409
And you agreed? I don't know
what to say. How could you do that?

389
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:39,278
How could you negotiate without me?
Never negotiate without your lawyer!

390
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:43,648
For a woman like Diana, I could have
gotten you at least two million!

391
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:48,053
Obviously! You don't wanna
get screwed and then screwed!

392
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:49,955
Stay, please. This is damage control.

393
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:53,427
- Two seconds. Eat cookies.
- No. We've heard enough.

394
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,931
- You're hired.
- You're our man. We love your style.

395
00:43:57,067 --> 00:44:00,434
Gladys, check the gentlemen's
schedules. Call me next week.

396
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,095
- Great.
- See you then.

397
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:06,005
- Thanks for coming.
- No. Thank you.

398
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,771
OK, David, before we go any further,

399
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:13,008
let's get the moral issue out of the way.

400
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:17,280
- <i>Leave that to us.</i>
- No, I was referring to my fee. I get 5%.

401
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,219
Would you elaborate
on the verification clause?

402
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:27,555
Verification. That means you pay, even
if the relationship isn't consummated.

403
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:31,128
You mean if I'm impotent.

404
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:34,600
It's important for a lawyer
to cover contingencies.

405
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:38,833
I can live with that.
The "John Garfield clause"?

406
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:42,070
That's if you die in the act.

407
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,978
I have no problem with that either.
Can I have your pen?

408
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:59,057
- You're pretty good, you know?
- Thank you.

409
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,720
You should come work for me.

410
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,910
We have a deal.

411
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:23,352
A million dollars will be deposited
in your casino account in the morning.

412
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:31,060
So...

413
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,920
So...

414
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:36,428
So...

415
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,860
You can go.

416
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,632
Gentlemen, I think it's time
for men of good will

417
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:47,437
to take leave of one another.

418
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:15,864
It's all right.

419
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,065
I don't bite.

420
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,902
So...

421
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,981
What, should I go undress?

422
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:34,018
Cheer up. Find a more creative way
to think about this, OK?

423
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:38,618
Just look at it like an episode of "The
Dating Game" that went a bit awry.

424
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:41,560
- It's gonna be OK...
- Ladies and gentlemen.

425
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:45,964
Me wish to welcome you
to our jamboree.

426
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:50,699
I couldn't believe it. I know
we could have gotten two million.

427
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,206
Here's your Buddha.

428
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,140
Davey, no point getting out
the crying towel.

429
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:59,045
You've got a million bucks, buddy.
A million bucks!

430
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:04,978
She's an amazing woman.
She really is.

431
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:09,024
Couldn't have gotten 500 for
my girlfriend. Not that I'd do that...

432
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:13,562
But it's OK that you did.
This is a different situation.

433
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,722
And she agreed to it,
you gotta remember that.

434
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:20,769
And it's not like it's hard duty or
anything. Hell, he's a great-looking guy.

435
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:23,964
For a million bucks, I'd sleep with him.

436
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,405
Maybe not.

437
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:29,876
Hey, buddy!

438
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:43,586
Come on!

439
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:53,225
Come on!

440
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:58,903
What have I done?

441
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,415
D, it's me!

442
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,452
D!

443
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,126
D!

444
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:26,564
Where is she? Where's my wife?

445
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:34,500
Diana!

446
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:36,510
Please!

447
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,444
Where did they go?

448
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,551
- Up!
- Up where?

449
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,451
- <i>Helicóptero.</i>
- Helicopter.

450
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:04,373
D!

451
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,702
D!

452
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:13,416
D! D!

453
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:20,717
D!

454
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,717
They sent for me.
They said you were ready.

455
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,488
Come here.

456
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:21,123
You missed a button.

457
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,859
Thank you.

458
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:35,235
I wanna show you something.

459
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,417
- What happened?
- Lights went off.

460
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,860
I see that. Why?

461
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:05,296
Look.

462
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,336
Can you turn those off, too?

463
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:18,407
I'm working on it.

464
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,678
Who made the decision?

465
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,625
- We both did.
- No.

466
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:37,366
Do it for your own reasons,
or don't do it.

467
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:42,368
- You don't know him.
- I know he didn't stop you.

468
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,598
And if you were mine...

469
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:50,672
...I wouldn't share you with anyone.

470
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:59,322
You have no right to judge David.

471
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:04,449
You're the one who has to buy women.

472
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:07,461
You think I have to buy women?

473
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:13,501
Why me, then?

474
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:17,231
I bought you because
you said you couldn't be bought.

475
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:20,973
I can't be bought.

476
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:23,443
We're just gonna fuck,
as I understand it.

477
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,246
You might enjoy it.

478
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,583
Don't bet on it.

479
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:35,622
I think I will.

480
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:44,555
Heads we do.
Tails we call the whole thing off.

481
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,602
Turn the boat around, go home.
No hard feelings.

482
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,702
What do you say?

483
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:53,802
It's your party.

484
00:56:55,979 --> 00:57:00,712
It's my lucky dollar, so I can't lose.

485
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:24,136
Trust me.

486
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:28,570
Nothing's gonna happen
you don't choose.

487
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:45,504
- I love you.
- I love you.

488
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:03,223
<i>I told myself it was over,</i>

489
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:06,062
<i>like a dream that vanishes</i>
<i>in the morning light,</i>

490
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:10,502
<i>and in time, enough time,</i>
<i>I would forget.</i>

491
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:26,579
Yeah.

492
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:29,714
All right.

493
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:37,555
Yeah. A little fixer-upper
south of Wilshire. It's nothing.

494
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,463
Yeah.

495
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:41,763
Look, I've got people here.

496
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:44,031
I'll talk to you later.

497
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:47,267
Sorry. I'm here for you now.

498
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:50,004
All right. Two acres on Alta Loma...

499
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:53,707
- Alta Vista.
- That's right. Murphy property.

500
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:57,882
We've been a little late on
the payments. We want to settle up.

501
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:01,286
I don't think that's possible.

502
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:04,291
- What do you mean?
- The mortgage is two months in default

503
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:08,989
and it appears that the property
is in contract to another party.

504
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:13,565
- To another party? Who?
- That's privileged information.

505
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:16,501
How can that be? We called
specifically for an extension.

506
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:19,233
The extension expired two days ago.

507
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:22,435
If you don't make a payment,
the bank can repossess.

508
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:26,105
Without prior notice? Can they do that?

509
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:28,444
They don't have to give us a warning.

510
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:31,644
But, in fact, an attempt was
made to call you on the 3rd.

511
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:35,519
A registered letter, return receipt
requested, was attempted on the 4th.

512
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:39,389
- Apparently there was no one home.
- We were out of town.

513
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:44,796
Well, I am sorry,
but you snooze, you lose.

514
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:48,697
"You snooze, you lose."

515
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:50,997
"You snooze, you lose"?

516
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:55,236
- It's an expression.
- That's beautiful.

517
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:58,246
That's bullshit!

518
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,906
This is bullshit, man!

519
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:05,749
Don't deal with these people! They
sold us out. They'll sell you out, too.

520
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:53,498
Wanna help me in the garden?

521
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,428
OK.

522
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:10,211
Our tomatoes are looking good,
don't you think?

523
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:13,849
David?

524
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:18,559
What's "Gryphonne"?

525
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:21,987
Gryphon.

526
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,393
Where did you hear that name?

527
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:29,569
You have a box of matches.

528
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:36,206
- We said we wouldn't talk about it.
- Yeah, well, now I want to talk about it.

529
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:40,546
Don't you?

530
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:43,846
- No.
- D.

531
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:49,550
I thought I could forget
about this, but I can't.

532
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:55,824
So I think maybe if we just talk about it,
we can put it behind us.

533
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:05,439
"Gryphon" is a boat.

534
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:07,975
He took you to a boat?

535
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:11,238
- In Nevada?
- We flew to Santa Barbara.

536
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,814
- What kind of boat?
- A big boat.

537
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:17,750
- And then what?
- And then nothing.

538
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:23,187
Where did you get the matches?
Were you going through my bag?

539
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:25,055
No!

540
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,625
Why? What's in your bag?

541
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:33,491
I'm not gonna talk about this.
I'm not gonna do it.

542
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:12,299
What?

543
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:17,999
- Who were you talking to?
- My mother.

544
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,405
And what did Mom have to say?

545
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,447
Nothing. She wasn't there.

546
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:29,779
You said you were just talking to her.
How could you be if she wasn't there?

547
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:34,049
Well, I was trying to talk to her,
but I didn't reach her.

548
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:36,886
- She wasn't in after ten o'clock?
- No, she's not.

549
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:41,122
If you don't believe me,
would you like to talk to her yourself?

550
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:46,097
What is the matter with you?

551
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:55,641
- What is that?
- You know what it is.

552
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:02,314
- Where did you get this?
- In your wallet.

553
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:03,850
I've never seen it.

554
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:07,717
It was in the secret compartment.
Have you been seeing him?

555
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,348
- No!
- You can't stop thinking about him.

556
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:11,983
You won't let me.

557
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:15,789
- Why did you look in my wallet?
- I don't trust you.

558
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:19,458
- You know, I don't trust you either.
- Well, then we're even.

559
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:30,708
<i>I had to do something.</i>

560
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:33,610
<i>I wanted to make something good</i>
<i>out of all we'd done wrong.</i>

561
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:37,651
<i>I decided to try and buy</i>
<i>our land back.</i>

562
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:40,381
OK. Alta Vista.

563
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:44,653
I just need to find out the guy's name.
I wanna make him an offer.

564
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:49,197
- I'll get killed for this, Diana.
- I don't want you to get in trouble.

565
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:51,925
- 543 Alta Vista.
- There it is.

566
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,036
There it is right there. Back up.

567
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:57,435
Here we go. 543 Alta Vista.

568
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:02,903
This guy's never gonna sell, Diana.

569
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:05,639
I just saw this guy on TV!

570
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:49,252
You bastard! You stole our property.

571
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:54,320
- I'd like to introduce a friend of mine...
- I'm not your friend.

572
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:57,091
- Diana advised me on some property...
- Bullshit!

573
01:08:57,233 --> 01:09:00,862
- You took it and I want it back.
- I tell you what. Can we have...

574
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:04,131
That's OK. No, everything's fine.
Everything's under control.

575
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:08,443
Excuse me.

576
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:17,276
I'm taking it off!

577
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:23,085
- Wait a minute...
- Why? Did you just wanna hurt me?

578
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:26,353
- No! I think you're wonderful.
- That was our house! How could you?

579
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:29,623
- I got there first.
- I want you to sell it back to me.

580
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:32,632
- You can't afford it.
- How's a million dollars?

581
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:36,465
- The price is two.
- If I had two, the price would be four.

582
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:38,732
Listen.
I saw an opportunity and took it.

583
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:42,970
You had the money and the right
instincts, but you were too late.

584
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:45,637
- I want you to work for me.
- Go to hell.

585
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:48,079
- Listen, I mean it.
- Never.

586
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:50,048
Why not?

587
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,746
- Because I hate you.
- No, you don't.

588
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,583
You wish you hated me.

589
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:18,474
Hi, D.

590
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:24,586
You look awful.

591
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:29,284
- Where have you been?
- I'll tell you about it.

592
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:32,622
I'm just gonna have some wine first.

593
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:36,722
Do you want some?

594
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:02,480
So where have you been?

595
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:10,989
Last night I stayed up for hours,
trying to figure a way out of this mess.

596
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:16,266
And today?

597
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:20,937
And today I saw Gage.

598
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:33,011
Thank you for your trust, David.
And for listening.

599
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:35,590
- Did you fuck him?
- No!

600
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:39,751
- But you wanted to, right?
- I met him in broad daylight, in public.

601
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:44,093
- I don't believe you.
- David, he bought our property.

602
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:49,296
That's why I went to see him. I just
wanted to find some way to get it back.

603
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:54,205
You have no reason to be jealous.
I hate him.

604
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:56,573
- Tell me what happened on that boat.
- Don't do this!

605
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:58,646
Tell me what happened!

606
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:01,375
- Why?
- 'Cause I wanna know.

607
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:04,918
All right, I'll tell you.
The man was a fucking stallion.

608
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:07,921
Is that what you want me to say?
We did it all night.

609
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:10,890
- Is that the truth?
- You don't want the truth.

610
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:15,793
You want me to lie and say he's awful.
So I'll say it, and you won't believe me.

611
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:18,456
Just tell me the truth, D.

612
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,161
It was sex, David.
Just sex. Not love, just sex.

613
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:25,467
- Was it good sex?
- Don't do this, David.

614
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:28,542
Can you just tell me that, D?
Why are you hesitating?

615
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:31,976
Just tell me. Was it good?

616
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:34,280
Yes.

617
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,253
David.

618
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:55,403
D, don't tell me it was just sex.
You were attracted to him all along.

619
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:58,836
That's bullshit.
David, I did it for you.

620
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:03,934
Don't tell me you did it for me. You did it
for yourself. You were dying to do it.

621
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:07,571
It's a lie. I would never do this
for myself. It was all for you.

622
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:11,277
Don't lie to me!
You were attracted to him!

623
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:14,841
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

624
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:20,250
I guess you make a deal with the devil,
and eventually you pay the price.

625
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:24,223
Thanks. From the man
who closed the deal with the devil,

626
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,919
that's very comforting.

627
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:31,556
Green.

628
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,362
- Hi, Di.
- I'm not here.

629
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:38,362
Yeah, he's right here.
You wanna speak to him?

630
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:42,204
- No, I don't wanna talk to him.
- <i>Look, sweetie.</i>

631
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:45,745
He loves you. You love him.

632
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:49,248
You gotta try and work this out.
It's pretty simple.

633
01:14:49,384 --> 01:14:53,878
- <i>This is a deal even I can't screw up.</i>
- Tell him he can keep the money.

634
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:58,023
I don't want any of it.

635
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:09,762
Davey? She says she
doesn't want the money.

636
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,773
I don't want the money either.

637
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:26,682
I'll take it.
I mean, if nobody else wants it.

638
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:51,906
- Hi.
- Hi, Diana.

639
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:10,055
<i>The next few weeks without David</i>
<i>felt like months.</i>

640
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:13,190
<i>I got very good at staring at walls.</i>

641
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:17,169
Diana, Diana.

642
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:18,796
The recession has ended.

643
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:23,037
There's a fella out there
wants to see $10 million homes.

644
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:25,476
There is a god.

645
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:30,549
Find someone else.

646
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:36,816
Are you nuts? Do you know what
the commission is on $10 million?

647
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:39,120
- I can't do it.
- You have to do it.

648
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,456
You're the best one I have.

649
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:45,499
You're the only one I have.
The others are all on caravan.

650
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:53,936
I'm sorry, Mr Langford. I can't.

651
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:59,013
I would never dream of forcing you
to do anything against your will.

652
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:02,073
Except this one time.

653
01:17:03,652 --> 01:17:06,815
Now move your ass or you're fired.

654
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:16,392
If you think this is gonna work,
you underestimate me.

655
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:44,151
You are truly beautiful.

656
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:47,859
What do you think you're doing?

657
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:52,129
Looking for a house.

658
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:59,502
There's Bel Air, Benedict Canyon,
Pacific Palisades.

659
01:17:59,641 --> 01:18:02,804
- Where would you like to go first?
- Paris.

660
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:07,580
1120 Bel Air Road, please.

661
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:20,892
The ceilings are French Gothic.
Renaissance paintings, as you can see.

662
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:23,020
Parquet floors throughout.

663
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:24,962
The bathrooms are Italian marble.

664
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,330
This is the master bath.

665
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:34,369
Why didn't you return my calls?

666
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:36,935
Do you like it?

667
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:39,709
No.

668
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:54,027
- 30 million minimum.
- You think?

669
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:56,221
- I know.
- Let's look at it.

670
01:18:56,364 --> 01:19:00,027
- It's not for sale.
- Everything's for sale.

671
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,326
This is your house, isn't it?

672
01:19:35,203 --> 01:19:36,830
Do you like it?

673
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:45,578
Well, it's certainly beautiful.

674
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,643
What do you think it needs?

675
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,843
Tell me. Honestly.

676
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,380
I think it needs a life.

677
01:19:57,392 --> 01:20:02,659
I think it needs furniture and
maybe a couple of dogs and flowers.

678
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,789
It needs you.

679
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:11,437
Just forget it. This just won't work.

680
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:13,200
Why not?

681
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:18,009
Because from where we've started
we've got nowhere to go.

682
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:20,137
You don't know that.

683
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:23,708
I've never started this way either.

684
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:29,386
I need you.

685
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:34,726
No.

686
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:37,058
You collect things.

687
01:20:40,035 --> 01:20:41,969
Don't you?

688
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:45,239
Sometimes.

689
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:53,606
Yeah.

690
01:21:57,646 --> 01:22:03,209
Even if you were extremely rich
and smart can you be president?

691
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:07,082
- No.
- You couldn't be president? Why not?

692
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:12,759
<i>I took a second job teaching</i>
<i>citizenship, just to keep myself busy.</i>

693
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:17,058
Ju, where were you born?

694
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:19,564
I was born in Seoul, Korea.

695
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:25,833
- OK, where was she born?
- She was born in Seoul, Korea.

696
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:30,275
<i>That drug dealer, he is the president.</i>

697
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:33,006
<i>In my country he could be both.</i>

698
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:36,348
Where were you born, Miguel?

699
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:40,215
- Sorry.
- Welcome back.

700
01:22:40,355 --> 01:22:44,291
- Where were you born?
- Cuba.

701
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:48,190
So, how do we say "Cuba"
in America?

702
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:50,389
Cuba.

703
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:54,201
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

704
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:57,567
- Isn't this the citizenship class?
- Yes.

705
01:22:57,706 --> 01:23:00,971
- Can I sit in?
- It's full.

706
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:13,282
- Cuba.
- Thank you.

707
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:30,835
OK, um...

708
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:32,735
I have a question for you.

709
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:36,833
Excuse me. Is there something
you'd like to share with us?

710
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:40,280
I was just saying
that you're an amazing woman.

711
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:47,412
And beautiful.

712
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:52,082
And talented.

713
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:54,695
And I am crazy about her.

714
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:08,340
- You're full of surprises, aren't you?
- I'm trying like hell.

715
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:11,908
- You should go.
- You want me to go?

716
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:13,674
No!

717
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:22,021
Nice people. They want the Dream.

718
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:25,217
Well, they saw it in the flesh tonight.

719
01:24:27,929 --> 01:24:30,830
You have chalk on your face.

720
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:35,861
I have something I wanna show you.

721
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:53,511
I didn't know whether
you like big ones or little ones.

722
01:24:55,957 --> 01:24:59,449
You're so beautiful. Come here.

723
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:05,931
I didn't have much time
to do anything else.

724
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:10,602
But it's a start.

725
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:25,853
Dance?

726
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:30,350
I should go.

727
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,927
I remember once when I was young,

728
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:39,863
and I was coming back from
a movie or something,

729
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:42,026
I was on the subway.

730
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:47,470
There was a girl sitting across from me.

731
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:53,570
She was wearing this dress that
was buttoned clear up right to here.

732
01:25:57,152 --> 01:26:00,280
She was the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen.

733
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:05,189
And I was shy then.

734
01:26:05,326 --> 01:26:08,557
So when she would look at me,

735
01:26:08,696 --> 01:26:10,687
I would look away.

736
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:15,168
Then, afterwards,
when I would look back,

737
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:17,498
she would look away.

738
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:25,173
Then I got to where I was gonna get
off, and got off. The doors closed.

739
01:26:27,081 --> 01:26:32,644
And as the train was pulling away,
she looked right at me

740
01:26:32,787 --> 01:26:35,483
and gave me the most incredible smile.

741
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:42,689
It was awful.
I wanted to tear the doors open.

742
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:47,767
I went back every night,
same time, for two weeks.

743
01:26:50,838 --> 01:26:53,534
But she never showed up.

744
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:57,640
That was 30 years ago.

745
01:26:58,846 --> 01:27:03,613
And I don't think there's a day
that goes by that I don't think about her.

746
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:08,748
I don't want that to happen again.

747
01:27:15,129 --> 01:27:16,824
Just one dance?

748
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:50,541
You wanted the driver's side...

749
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:53,709
I want a word with you, Gage.

750
01:30:53,848 --> 01:30:57,750
What you don't know is
we got a secret, me and Diana.

751
01:30:57,885 --> 01:30:59,284
We're invincible.

752
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:04,451
- Diana, I need to talk...
- Tomorrow might be a better time.

753
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:06,822
Tomorrow might be better, you think?

754
01:31:06,961 --> 01:31:08,986
Johnny-baby,
I got a suggestion for you.

755
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:14,193
You know that emblem you got?
The gryphon? The eagle?

756
01:31:14,335 --> 01:31:18,396
I don't think it's a good idea.
I got a better idea.

757
01:31:18,539 --> 01:31:23,670
How about the cuckoo? Because...
I'm talking to you for a second.

758
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:26,974
The cuckoo is interesting.
It doesn't have its own nest,

759
01:31:27,114 --> 01:31:30,880
so it moves into the nest of other birds
and destroys their eggs.

760
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:32,542
David, stop.

761
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:38,051
You don't love me any more?

762
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:46,358
Have I ever told you I love you?

763
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:53,096
Have a nice dinner.

764
01:31:54,909 --> 01:31:56,934
- Help him.
- Here.

765
01:31:58,446 --> 01:32:00,073
Go inside.

766
01:32:00,214 --> 01:32:03,012
You got him?

767
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:07,283
D.

768
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:37,093
You've done a lot since USC.

769
01:34:37,238 --> 01:34:41,265
First in your class. AIA award.

770
01:34:41,409 --> 01:34:44,867
- Prix de Rome.
- Yeah.

771
01:34:46,313 --> 01:34:49,146
Why would you want this job?

772
01:34:49,283 --> 01:34:52,343
Well, I wanna work.

773
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:57,787
Overqualified.

774
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:00,850
Fine. Exploit me.

775
01:35:36,897 --> 01:35:39,593
Great architecture
only comes from your passion,

776
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:41,998
and even that won't assure you a job.

777
01:35:42,136 --> 01:35:44,696
Louis Kahn.

778
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:49,003
Died in a men's room in Penn Station.
For days, no one claimed the body.

779
01:35:49,143 --> 01:35:50,940
Look at that. Is that beautiful?

780
01:35:51,078 --> 01:35:53,273
The money men did not weep,

781
01:35:53,414 --> 01:35:56,144
because the great ones
are impossible to deal with.

782
01:35:56,283 --> 01:36:01,380
They're a pain in the ass, because they
know that if they do their jobs properly,

783
01:36:01,522 --> 01:36:03,888
if they just this once get it right,

784
01:36:04,024 --> 01:36:08,552
they can actually lift the human spirit,
take it to a higher place.

785
01:36:13,968 --> 01:36:16,528
- What is this?
- A brick.

786
01:36:18,038 --> 01:36:20,370
Good. What else?

787
01:36:20,508 --> 01:36:22,442
A weapon.

788
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:30,048
Louis Kahn said, "Even a brick
wants to be something."

789
01:36:36,924 --> 01:36:40,917
A brick wants to be something.

790
01:36:43,164 --> 01:36:45,132
It aspires.

791
01:36:51,405 --> 01:36:56,741
Even a common, ordinary brick
wants to be something more than it is.

792
01:37:01,949 --> 01:37:05,783
Wants to be something better than it is.

793
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:15,754
That is what we must be.

794
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,932
See you on Friday.

795
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:36,711
A brick wants to be something?
I bet it doesn't want to be a lawyer.

796
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,285
- What are you doing here?
- I missed you.

797
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,083
- I missed you, too.
- Thanks.

798
01:37:47,995 --> 01:37:50,520
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.

799
01:37:50,664 --> 01:37:52,689
I'm getting it together.

800
01:37:58,138 --> 01:38:00,129
She wants a divorce.

801
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:05,374
She wants her freedom.

802
01:38:06,914 --> 01:38:10,611
If you don't contest it,
you get everything.

803
01:38:10,751 --> 01:38:14,187
The land, the money. Everything.

804
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:17,054
Where is she?

805
01:38:25,766 --> 01:38:29,099
Hi, everybody. I'm Billy Connolly.
Goodbye, everybody.

806
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:33,002
You may wonder what you're doing
here, sitting in the blazing sun,

807
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:36,769
as the smell of the zoo
wafts past your nostrils.

808
01:38:36,911 --> 01:38:40,642
The reason you are here
is because you are loaded.

809
01:38:40,781 --> 01:38:43,375
May I say how brilliant it is
to see so many people

810
01:38:43,517 --> 01:38:46,714
with an interest in the preservation
of endangered species.

811
01:38:46,854 --> 01:38:50,221
Every year, we have this unique way
of making money for the cause.

812
01:38:50,357 --> 01:38:53,918
We auction animals.
We bid as high as we possibly can,

813
01:38:54,061 --> 01:38:56,621
and the money goes
to sponsor these lovely beasts.

814
01:38:56,764 --> 01:39:01,167
Let's start the show with a bang. We've
got a superstar as our first animal.

815
01:39:01,302 --> 01:39:04,601
Ladies and gentlemen, the hippo.

816
01:39:04,738 --> 01:39:08,504
The animal itself
is far too big and angry to bring along.

817
01:39:08,642 --> 01:39:12,237
Look at this guy.
Thousands and thousands of pounds

818
01:39:12,379 --> 01:39:15,314
of aggressive, hostile cellulite.

819
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:18,384
Weighs slightly less
than the average school bus.

820
01:39:18,519 --> 01:39:21,181
And look at that magnificent beastie.

821
01:39:21,322 --> 01:39:26,350
To put him in a better light,
to relieve you of some serious money...

822
01:39:26,493 --> 01:39:28,688
Thank you very much.

823
01:39:28,829 --> 01:39:31,229
...we have a kissy-kissy picture.

824
01:39:32,366 --> 01:39:34,493
Isn't that nice?

825
01:39:37,204 --> 01:39:42,141
Ladies and gentlemen, I couldn't dream
of starting the bid below $10,000.

826
01:39:42,276 --> 01:39:44,608
- Now, I know it's a lot of money...
- 30.

827
01:39:44,745 --> 01:39:48,545
$30,000, ladies and gentlemen!

828
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:54,346
Call me a sentimental old fool,
do I hear 35?

829
01:39:54,488 --> 01:39:57,355
- 35.
- $35,000!

830
01:39:57,491 --> 01:40:00,016
- 40.
- $40,000!

831
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,390
45,000.

832
01:40:02,529 --> 01:40:05,896
- 50.
- $50,000.

833
01:40:06,967 --> 01:40:11,165
I can't believe it. That's extraordinary.
50,000 once,

834
01:40:11,305 --> 01:40:14,570
50,000 twice, ladies and gentlemen...

835
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:17,404
One million dollars.

836
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:24,783
I'm sorry?

837
01:40:24,918 --> 01:40:27,182
One million dollars.

838
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:32,420
Did you say one million dollars, sir?

839
01:40:32,559 --> 01:40:34,151
Yeah.

840
01:40:34,294 --> 01:40:37,855
Ladies and gentlemen,
one million dollars.

841
01:40:39,266 --> 01:40:42,997
Would anybody care to top that,
ladies and gentlemen?

842
01:40:43,137 --> 01:40:44,399
I didn't think so.

843
01:40:44,538 --> 01:40:47,905
In that case, sir, I believe you're
the proud owner of a hippo.

844
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:49,634
Congratulations.

845
01:41:03,624 --> 01:41:06,252
Hello, Diana.

846
01:41:06,393 --> 01:41:08,190
The next animal to take the stand
is an ostrich...

847
01:41:08,328 --> 01:41:10,455
I really wanted you to have that money.

848
01:41:10,597 --> 01:41:13,065
I really wanted you to have that hippo.

849
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:20,302
Maybe you two would like
a moment alone.

850
01:41:33,987 --> 01:41:35,750
So...

851
01:41:38,725 --> 01:41:40,488
- How are you...
- I hear you're teaching...

852
01:41:40,627 --> 01:41:43,425
- Sorry.
- Go ahead.

853
01:41:43,564 --> 01:41:45,930
Yeah. I'm teaching.

854
01:41:48,302 --> 01:41:53,137
You know, it doesn't pay much, but
at least I get to talk about architecture.

855
01:41:53,273 --> 01:41:56,674
You know how I love
to talk about architecture.

856
01:41:58,412 --> 01:42:01,848
Don't leave, ladies and gentlemen.
It's just a shower.

857
01:42:01,982 --> 01:42:05,281
A cheque book
makes an ideal umbrella.

858
01:42:05,419 --> 01:42:08,547
Do we have a dolphin?
Have we a dolphin and an octopus?

859
01:42:08,689 --> 01:42:10,748
How about tropical fish?

860
01:42:10,891 --> 01:42:13,826
I know. You're running home
for more cash.

861
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:17,522
Come on, ladies and gentlemen.
You can find the money.

862
01:42:17,664 --> 01:42:20,132
To hell. I'm gone.

863
01:42:29,443 --> 01:42:31,741
I have to talk to you
about what happened.

864
01:42:31,879 --> 01:42:34,507
- Don't.
- No. I have to.

865
01:42:34,648 --> 01:42:37,446
Just hear me out.

866
01:42:39,686 --> 01:42:42,917
I think the mistake I made in Vegas

867
01:42:43,056 --> 01:42:47,254
was thinking that I could
forget what we did.

868
01:42:48,595 --> 01:42:51,723
I thought we were invincible.

869
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:58,772
Now I know that the things that people
in love do to each other, they remember.

870
01:42:58,906 --> 01:43:02,239
And if they stay together,
it's not because they forget,

871
01:43:02,376 --> 01:43:04,310
it's because they forgive.

872
01:43:11,285 --> 01:43:13,276
I was just...

873
01:43:16,223 --> 01:43:19,624
I was just so afraid
that you wanted him.

874
01:43:20,661 --> 01:43:23,824
No, actually, I was afraid
you were right to want him.

875
01:43:29,102 --> 01:43:32,538
I thought he was the better man.

876
01:43:37,611 --> 01:43:42,844
And I know now he's not.
He's just got more money.

877
01:45:15,475 --> 01:45:17,340
I think we should talk.

878
01:45:18,245 --> 01:45:20,236
I am very happy.

879
01:45:21,682 --> 01:45:25,482
Shackleford,
have you ever seen me like this?

880
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:29,152
Can't say that I have.

881
01:45:29,289 --> 01:45:33,282
- Diana's the reason.
- Enough for any man.

882
01:45:33,427 --> 01:45:37,488
She is the best of them. Absolutely.

883
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:40,496
You are the best of them.

884
01:45:42,002 --> 01:45:44,061
"The best of them"?

885
01:45:44,204 --> 01:45:46,729
You said I'm the best of them?

886
01:45:46,873 --> 01:45:48,807
You are.

887
01:45:51,445 --> 01:45:53,174
I don't understand.

888
01:45:54,815 --> 01:45:57,807
Shackleford,
could you explain it to her?

889
01:45:57,951 --> 01:45:59,418
What?

890
01:46:00,787 --> 01:46:03,585
I could do that, sir.

891
01:46:03,724 --> 01:46:07,285
But I feel Ms Murphy
would rather hear it from you.

892
01:46:07,427 --> 01:46:10,191
OK. All right.

893
01:46:10,330 --> 01:46:14,096
She's the best of
the million-dollar club. Obviously.

894
01:46:17,537 --> 01:46:20,995
- "Million-dollar club"?
- Now you've got it.

895
01:46:22,909 --> 01:46:24,501
You told me you'd
never done that before.

896
01:46:24,644 --> 01:46:27,204
How many members
would you say there are?

897
01:46:28,081 --> 01:46:30,140
- Members?
- Yeah.

898
01:46:31,651 --> 01:46:34,245
- Worldwide?
- Yeah.

899
01:46:36,089 --> 01:46:37,647
I think a couple of dozen.

900
01:46:39,159 --> 01:46:41,753
Remember the one
that wouldn't stop hiccuping?

901
01:46:41,895 --> 01:46:44,887
- What?
- The waitress from Oklahoma.

902
01:46:45,031 --> 01:46:48,523
Every time you came near her,
she would convulse in hiccups.

903
01:46:50,604 --> 01:46:54,563
Yeah. I had forgotten. Quite a night.

904
01:46:56,643 --> 01:47:02,138
The best thing of it is that
you know if you're sexually compatible

905
01:47:02,282 --> 01:47:04,546
right from the start.

906
01:47:15,095 --> 01:47:17,655
Shackleford, would you stop the car?

907
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:49,228
Thank you, John.

908
01:47:53,266 --> 01:47:54,528
Goodbye.

909
01:47:55,702 --> 01:47:57,829
Goodbye.

910
01:48:04,344 --> 01:48:06,107
Here.

911
01:48:10,016 --> 01:48:11,483
For luck.

912
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:22,151
- Take care of him.
- Sure.

913
01:48:31,137 --> 01:48:33,503
What was all that about?

914
01:48:35,375 --> 01:48:37,809
I wanted to end it.

915
01:48:41,715 --> 01:48:45,276
She never would have looked
at me the way she did at him.

916
01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:40,464
<i>Seven years ago, David proposed</i>
<i>to me at Paradise Cove.</i>

917
01:49:41,808 --> 01:49:46,609
<i>I wanted to go there to remember</i>
<i>and start over.</i>

918
01:50:52,746 --> 01:50:55,909
Have I ever told you I love you?

919
01:51:05,358 --> 01:51:07,223
No.

920
01:51:11,197 --> 01:51:13,222
I do.

921
01:51:18,471 --> 01:51:20,132
Still?

922
01:51:24,277 --> 01:51:26,142
Always.
