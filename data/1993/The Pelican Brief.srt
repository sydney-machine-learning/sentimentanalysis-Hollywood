The. Pelican. Brief. 1993
.720p. BluRay. x264-SiNNERS

2
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,211
The Pelican Brief

3
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,947
Any signs got my name on them?

4
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,449
Quite a few.

5
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,451
What do they say?

6
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,288
The usual.

7
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,707
"Death to Rosenberg. "

8
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,792
"Retire Rosenberg. "

9
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,461
"Cut off the oxygen. "

10
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,965
That's my favorite.

11
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,553
Of course, you, Mr. Grantham...

12
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,681
...did pretty good by me
your last time out.

13
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,186
"Rosenberg equals the government
over business...

14
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:51,648
...the individual over government,
the environment over everything...

15
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,735
...and the Indians, oh,
give them whatever they want. "

16
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,822
With all due respect,
that wasn't my line, that was a quote.

17
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,868
From one of your unnamed
Senior White House officials.

18
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,871
Senior White House bastard,
you should have said.

19
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,539
Got in there by...

20
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,876
...stirring up these people,
one against the other.

21
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,464
Never fails to amaze me...

22
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,384
...what a man will do
to get an oval office.

23
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,241
Yes?

24
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,494
Looking for Mr. Sneller.
Mr. Sneller?

25
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,539
Yes, Mr. Edwin F. Sneller.

26
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,447
Hello.
Everything is in place.

27
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,701
All the money must be there
when I arrive in Zurich.

28
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,912
It will be there
if the job is finished.

29
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,707
It will be finished.

30
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,215
May I help you?
I'd like to order room service.

31
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,301
- What would you like?
- Coffee...

32
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,971
...scrambled eggs, whole-wheat toast
and orange juice, please.

33
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,056
It'll be about 15 minutes.
Thank you.

34
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,185
When we substitute
threat for an argument...

35
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,438
...violence for principle,
we allow our passion...

36
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,607
...to overcome our capacity for reason.

37
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,819
Passion and self-interest
are threats to liberty...

38
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,740
...which brings us
to Bowers against Hardwick.

39
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:14,328
A police officer entered Mr. Hardwick's
apartment to serve him a warrant...

40
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,831
...for an unpaid violation
for drinking in public.

41
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,334
They caught him with an open beer.

42
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,086
When he entered
Mr. Hardwick's bedroom...

43
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,714
...he found him in bed with a man.

44
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,091
The officer arrested Hardwick...

45
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,261
...for violating Georgia's statute
which outlaws sodomy.

46
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,097
Even though Georgia dropped the case...

47
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,976
...Hardwick challenged
the constitutionality of the statute.

48
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,603
Now, what was his claim?

49
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:43,941
- That it violates the right of privacy.
Why?

50
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,278
He's got the right to do
as he pleases in his home.

51
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:54,451
But what if he decided to sell drugs
at his home or engage in child abuse?

52
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,372
Those actions don't fit
within the right of privacy.

53
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,666
The court, beginning with Griswold...

54
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,961
...has limited the right of privacy
to actions which are intimate...

55
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:08,757
...which are deeply personal,
which allow us to control our lives...

56
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,467
...to define who we are.

57
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,637
But is that a constitutional claim?
There's no...

58
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:16,682
...right to define oneself
written into the Constitution.

59
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,767
It's not even in the Bill of Rights.

60
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,812
If the State of Georgia can regulate
Hardwick's sexuality...

61
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,274
...engaged in private with consenting
adults, Hardwick cannot be free.

62
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,985
The Constitution ensures
limited government.

63
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,822
If there's no right of privacy
and Georgia can enforce the statute...

64
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,200
...we sacrifice the liberty the framers
thought they'd guaranteed us.

65
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,870
The Supreme Court disagreed with you.

66
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,914
They found that the statute
did not violate the right of privacy.

67
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,332
Why?

68
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,542
They're wrong.

69
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,945
So all three of you girls
find him irresistible. Why?

70
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,822
Sexual attraction.

71
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,408
You mean he's just got it?

72
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,076
Does he ever!

73
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,870
What you're saying...

74
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,707
...is that if you could clone
three of him, you'd all be happy.

75
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,835
Okay, tell us, what is your secret?

76
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:29,213
I'm not sure I can say on TV.

77
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,466
But what I can say is
it's a big secret.

78
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,718
A very big secret.

79
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,889
My goodness gracious!
I can't believe my ears!

80
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,766
Hope my mom's not watching.

81
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,434
She hopes so too!

82
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,228
Ma, I was just kidding.

83
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,147
Ladies, have you changed
your opinion about our stud?

84
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,233
You still like him?

85
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,902
I like big guys!

86
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,488
I think your fan club has increased.

87
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,240
Everything has increased!

88
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,658
They found Rosenberg around 1 A.M.

89
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,035
His nurse was also murdered.

90
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:50,122
Jensen was found two hours later
in some queer club.

91
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:54,960
Voyles called me, wildly upset.
It's hardly good for FBI's reputation.

92
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,254
He and Giminski are on the way.
Giminski?

93
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,174
Yes. The CIA should be involved,
at least for now.

94
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:05,429
You must wait two hours to address
the nation if we want an audience.

95
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,433
A coat and tie may seem a bit rehearsed.
How about a cardigan?

96
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:14,271
You want me to talk to the nation in a
time of crisis wearing a sweater?

97
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,689
Mr. President...

98
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,944
...I've already told Justice
to put together a list of nominees.

99
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:23,655
Restructuring the court
will be your legacy.

100
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:25,824
Mr. President.

101
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:30,078
Mr. Voyles,
does the FBI have any suspects?

102
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,496
It's too soon.

103
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,291
We'll have ballistics
and autopsies later.

104
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:38,962
I would like to have a report
on your security and where it broke down.

105
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,673
You're assuming it broke down.

106
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:47,095
We have two dead judges, both of whom
were being protected by the FBI.

107
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,473
Bob, I'd like a straight answer.

108
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:53,185
Are these killings in any way
linked to the CIA...

109
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:57,523
...or to any other agency
of the United States government?

110
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,525
I'm shocked you'd think that.

111
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,818
Bob, just look into it, okay?

112
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,738
I suggest we meet back here at five.

113
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,324
Five, gentlemen.
Thank you.

114
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,251
It's rally-around-the-leader time.

115
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,337
Your approval ratings will go
through the roof.

116
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:25,175
That's the weather
in New Orleans. This is Tim Bellew.

117
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,136
We interrupt our program now
for a special bulletin.

118
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:31,515
In a special address,
live from the White House...

119
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,184
...the president of the United States.

120
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,271
My fellow Americans...

121
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:41,024
...our country has suffered
a grievous loss.

122
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:42,943
Last night...

123
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:48,282
...Supreme Court Justices
Rosenberg and Jensen...

124
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,200
...were assassinated.

125
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:56,790
These assassinations may be an
attempt to strike at the very fabric...

126
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,667
...of our government.

127
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,378
But I can assure each...

128
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,672
...and every American...

129
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,801
...that these dastardly acts
will not go unpunished.

130
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,763
Everything...

131
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:16,059
...is being and will be done
to bring the culprit...

132
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,062
...or culprits to justice.

133
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,732
For justice must...

134
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,193
...and shall prevail.

135
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:29,281
I wish you could have known him
when I used to clerk for him.

136
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,243
Last time I saw him,
only the mind was left.

137
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,579
That's why they killed him.

138
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,831
That mind was still a threat.

139
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:42,294
But why kill him now,
when he had so little time left?

140
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,924
Maybe they couldn't take a chance
he'd last till the elections.

141
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,635
So why Jensen?
This president nominated him.

142
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,513
He and Rosenberg had almost
nothing in common.

143
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,100
That's what they should look for.

144
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,603
Decisions on which they both agreed.

145
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,774
Boy, if there ever was a moment
for a drink...

146
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,363
One day at a time, right?

147
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:25,295
We're talking a conspiracy,
then who are the conspirators?

148
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:30,008
If we've let foreign terrorists in,
there'll be hell to pay politically.

149
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:34,805
The intelligence community can't be
blamed for a weakness in immigration.

150
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,808
Denton, who are your suspects?

151
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,144
This has to be kept very quiet.

152
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,481
Of course.
This is the Oval Office.

153
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:50,863
At least 11 Underground Army members
have been in the D.C. area...

154
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:55,534
...and we suspect them in at least
100 bombings of abortion clinics...

155
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:58,328
...porno houses,
gay clubs all over the country.

156
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,164
The truth is,
you don't have a suspect.

157
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:05,335
Correct?

158
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,797
Watch your claws.

159
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:19,600
Gray Grantham covers the
Supreme Court for the Washington Herald.

160
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,437
You actually interviewed
Justice Rosenberg...

161
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:27,232
...before he was shot on,
as it turned out, the day he died.

162
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:31,737
Did he say anything that might shed
some light on these dreadful events?

163
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,697
Yes. He spoke about things...

164
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:38,327
...off the record,
appropriately for a sitting justice.

165
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,371
But I think it would be appropriate
to quote him now.

166
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,417
He said, "The campaign waged
by the president was so ruthless...

167
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:49,338
...in its manipulation of the
middle-class fears of minorities...

168
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,052
...had been so exploitive and divisive
that it created a climate of distrust. "

169
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:58,472
You know, that Grantham's
a man after my own heart.

170
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:02,768
Everyone wants to know
when you're starting classes again.

171
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,645
That includes me.

172
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:10,484
You know what they say:
Drinking makes depression worse.

173
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,905
What do they recommend for anguish?
Where've you been?

174
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:18,450
The library. I studied a printout
of the Supreme Court docket.

175
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,245
I even made a list of possible suspects.

176
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,748
And then threw it away
because they'd be obvious to everyone.

177
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,795
Then you looked for areas
Jensen and Rosenberg had in common.

178
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:31,088
Exactly.

179
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,676
Jensen generally protected the rights
of criminal defendants.

180
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,135
Some notable exceptions.

181
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:40,889
He wrote 3 majority opinions
protective of the environment.

182
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,267
And almost always supported
tax protestors.

183
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:48,188
So they might have been assassinated
by an insatiable tax collector?

184
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,983
As yet, I rule no one out.

185
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,653
Everyone is assuming the motive
is hatred or revenge.

186
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,281
Or an attempt to influence
the social agenda of the court.

187
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,326
What if the issue involved
old-fashioned material greed?

188
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,954
A case that involves
a great deal of money?

189
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:08,000
- Can I help you?
- I'd like to see this file, please.

190
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,043
Why?

191
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,296
It's public record, isn't it?

192
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:13,964
Semi-public.

193
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,509
Are you familiar with
the Freedom of Information Act?

194
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:20,846
This file has the pleading...

195
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:24,474
...and correspondence.
The rest is discovery and the trial.

196
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,185
When was the trial?
Last summer.

197
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,729
Went on for 2 months.
Where's the appeal?

198
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:32,816
Not perfected yet.
I think the deadline is August 1st.

199
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:04,241
So, who done it?

200
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:09,454
You have some obscure suspect unknown
to the FBI and the CIA and...

201
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:13,083
...Secret Service
and 10,000 police departments?

202
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,585
I had one...

203
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,796
...which I have now discarded.

204
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:23,427
You skipped class, ignored me for a
week, just to throw it away?

205
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:24,928
Let me see it.

206
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:30,809
Don't laugh. It was ludicrous of me
to think I could solve it.

207
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,936
Hubris of the young, huh?

208
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:35,814
Don't knock the hubris that I love.

209
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,822
I'm leaving tomorrow.

210
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:47,868
I'm going up to Rosenberg's memorial
in Washington.

211
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:55,167
I went through Rosenberg's decisions
the other night...

212
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:59,338
...and in the back of my mind
there's an idea...

213
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:02,299
...to do a book on him.

214
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:04,468
No one could do it better.

215
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:08,138
I started making notes...

216
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,144
...about what he meant to me:
surrogate father, mentor, you know.

217
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,485
I started to get very thirsty.

218
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,991
I deserted you this week.

219
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,160
Not the greatest timing.

220
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:33,163
You're here to study law,
not keep me sober.

221
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:37,709
It's Alice.

222
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,756
Want to come out with me for a burger?

223
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,842
No, thanks.

224
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:47,636
It might do you good to get out.

225
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,222
I'm fine, thanks.

226
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:51,640
You sure?
Yes.

227
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,853
Okay, bye.

228
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:01,692
Hey, Sarge.

229
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,151
Hey, son.

230
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:06,905
Dark coffee, three sugars.

231
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:08,699
So how's the president?

232
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:10,659
Which one?

233
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,661
Not Coal, the real one.

234
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,246
Cool and mellow.

235
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:18,458
Would you believe he's all tore up
about Rosenberg?

236
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,712
And all fired up about...

237
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,714
...restructuring the court.

238
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:25,716
Thinks it'll make his place in history.

239
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,926
Sounds like Coal.
What'd you get me?

240
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,929
There's a short list of nominees.

241
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:35,434
The original had 20 or so names,
then they cut it to 8. I gave you 2.

242
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:37,561
What about the investigation?

243
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,563
I haven't heard much...

244
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,690
...but I'll keep my ears open.

245
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:44,234
- I know you will. Thanks.
- I got that.

246
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:45,777
I'll see you later.

247
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:47,779
Mellow, mellow, mellow.

248
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:52,409
Martini, please.

249
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,996
Good day.
Good to see you.

250
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,916
Another coffee, please.

251
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,835
You read the Grantham article.

252
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:04,755
It had me running around all day.

253
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:09,468
Coal blasted the director, saying the
judges' names were leaked by the FBI.

254
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,972
The director said Coal had leaked them
himself to test the waters.

255
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,768
Coal ran the most divisive campaign
in 20 years...

256
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,478
...and the president did nothing.

257
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:24,316
I'd like to have seen your name
on this list of judges.

258
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:27,653
We all voted you
most likely to make the court.

259
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,324
These days, it's hard enough
just to make my class.

260
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:34,993
How old is she, this time?

261
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,956
Twenty-four. But she's...

262
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:40,624
...extremely mature.

263
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,128
At 24, she's mature.

264
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:48,131
I don't know if I believe that.
Do you have a photo?

265
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,552
No, I don't. She's not a puppy dog
or a grandchild.

266
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,303
Thank God.

267
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:56,849
Who killed them, Gavin?

268
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:01,144
I'm just a lawyer with the Bureau,
I'm not an agent.

269
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,147
But, as I recall, you have great ears.

270
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:08,151
To be honest, we don't have a clue.

271
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:14,074
My girlfriend wrote
a very interesting essay...

272
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:17,494
...on who might have ordered
the assassinations.

273
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:19,329
Your girlfriend has a theory?

274
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:26,086
Here, take a look at it. You'll get
a kick out of the way her mind works.

275
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:48,192
Is this Gray Grantham?
- Yes, it is.

276
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,946
Sorry to call at such a crazy hour.
I'm at a pay phone on my way to work.

277
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:56,325
I can't call from home or the office.

278
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,368
What kind of office?

279
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:00,204
I'm an attorney.

280
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:02,247
Private or government?

281
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:04,374
I'd rather not say.

282
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:07,961
I may know something
about Rosenberg and Jensen.

283
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:10,839
Are you recording this?

284
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:13,759
Can this call be traced?

285
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:17,346
I'm not recording it or tracing it.
I promise you.

286
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,723
I may know who killed them.

287
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:23,644
What's your name?

288
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,230
Garcia.

289
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:30,400
That's not your real name.

290
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:36,907
I think I saw something at the office
I wasn't supposed to see.

291
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,369
Do you have a copy?

292
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,082
I need to think about this.

293
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,376
- I understand.
- I'm not thinking rationally.

294
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:50,921
Listen, I promise you...

295
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:55,092
...I will protect you
as a confidential source.

296
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:03,433
Hello.

297
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,117
Got you.

298
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,420
Mr. Grantham's not here,
but he left his car number for you.

299
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:37,509
It's Garcia.
I still don't know what to do.

300
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,970
Mr. Garcia...

301
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:44,516
...I've gone to jail
rather than reveal a source.

302
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:48,020
I know what kind of hell
this must be for you.

303
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:52,482
You're clearly a decent human being,
a good citizen.

304
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:57,154
But could you live with yourself
if you don't reveal what you know?

305
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,158
MORGAN
I'll get back to you.

306
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,025
Taxi!

307
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:47,538
French authorities reviewed footage
from the airport cameras in Paris...

308
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:52,000
...and think they recognized a face
that might be Khamel's, the terrorist.

309
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:57,005
He may have arrived here on a flight
10 hours after we found Jensen's body.

310
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:00,008
Anything else?

311
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:03,011
Maybe a small new wrinkle.

312
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:06,557
What's the wrinkle?

313
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:09,810
It's a theory that surfaced
in the last 24 hours.

314
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,104
Voyles is really intrigued by it.

315
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:15,566
He's afraid it might be damaging
to the president.

316
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:20,279
How's that?

317
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,614
It's all there in the brief.

318
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:33,333
It's amateur stuff...

319
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:37,546
...but how often does something make
Coal sweat and run for cover?

320
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:40,465
He didn't exactly sweat in front of us.

321
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,427
But his stone face showed
he wasn't happy.

322
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:45,095
Did he have any symptoms?

323
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:48,974
As I told you, the president
is here for his annual checkup.

324
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:50,934
I wish I was in as good shape.

325
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:53,979
Was this timed to counter
the age issue in the next election?

326
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:55,981
Why didn't I think of that?

327
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:58,275
He hasn't decided whether to run again.

328
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:00,152
When will he decide?

329
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:03,113
Do you really expect me to answer that?

330
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:07,451
One rumor I can deny is
that he checked in to get away from you.

331
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:09,453
Although could you blame him?

332
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:12,956
Thank you again.

333
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:18,837
Commander, go downstairs and tell them
I have a date for golf this afternoon.

334
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:20,339
Yes, sir!

335
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,301
It's killing the press
you're so healthy.

336
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:27,137
Good.
Now, what's so important?

337
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:29,223
This is...

338
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,141
...a brief...

339
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:34,353
...written by an eager-beaver
law student.

340
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:37,147
It's a theory about the assassinations.

341
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:39,483
And indirectly...

342
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:41,318
...it implicates the White House.

343
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:46,990
The premise is so far-fetched
it's absurd.

344
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:51,119
But Director Voyles, for reasons
both you and I can guess...

345
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:52,329
...is going after it.

346
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,544
Well, we...

347
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:01,713
We can't interfere
with his investigation.

348
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:04,675
You should ask Giminski
to have the CIA investigate.

349
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:10,180
When we confirm that this is garbage,
you can ask Voyles to back off.

350
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:12,683
It's domestic.

351
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:17,271
The CIA can't go nosing around.
It's illegal.

352
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:19,356
Yes, technically.

353
00:32:22,401 --> 00:32:23,527
What about...

354
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:25,195
...your friend...

355
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:28,866
...Barr, and the Unit,
I think you call it.

356
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:31,243
I've spoken to Barr.

357
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:34,371
They're very good
for small specific missions...

358
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:36,456
...but they aren't the CIA.

359
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:40,711
How does it implicate the White House?
What are there, names?

360
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:43,380
One name.

361
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,384
Someone we both know?

362
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,911
Mr. President...

363
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,794
I've decided my agenda for the future.

364
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:25,214
I'll stay in bed...

365
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,090
...drink...

366
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:29,301
...make love...

367
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,764
...and forget the whole damn business.

368
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,434
You don't approve.

369
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,521
What about the book on Rosenberg?

370
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,606
You should write it.

371
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:45,651
- Let's go.
- You should.

372
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:49,112
You have the youth, the energy,
the certitude.

373
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:50,822
You'd be perfect.

374
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:53,116
Can I have the keys?

375
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:01,834
I'm perfectly capable of driving.

376
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:04,461
You've drunk too much.

377
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:09,842
Give me the keys.

378
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:14,555
Remember the Mashed Potato?
Give me the keys.

379
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:16,473
- You're too young.
- I know it.

380
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:19,017
Do you remember the Fishback?

381
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,311
- The Slide?
- No. Please.

382
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:23,689
- Please what?
- Give me the keys.

383
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:26,817
Give me the keys.
I'll drive or I'll walk.

384
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,360
You'll walk?
Yes.

385
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:33,073
Have a nice stroll.

386
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,376
Miss Shaw!

387
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:50,591
You take my breath away!

388
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:58,098
Thomas!

389
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:03,520
Oh, my God!

390
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:23,624
Watch the door.

391
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:30,589
I'm Sergeant Rupert, NOPD.

392
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:33,884
You'll be safe in my car.

393
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:39,556
Your name?

394
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:48,899
Darby Shaw.

395
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:54,613
Let's go.

396
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:03,163
Is this your car?

397
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:08,418
Come here.

398
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,964
I'm Lieutenant Olsen, NOPD.

399
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:14,758
I'm taking you to the hospital.

400
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:16,927
Check the plates.

401
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,930
Did you know the man in the car?

402
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,437
Thomas Callahan.

403
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:40,951
It'll be a few minutes.

404
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:47,624
Are you sure that the man who
called himself Rupert said he was a cop?

405
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:55,632
We don't have a record of a cop
named Rupert. The computer...

406
00:36:55,841 --> 00:37:00,554
...has no record of the tag numbers of
the car you were in. Must be fake.

407
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:05,225
I'll go move the car.
I'll be back.

408
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:06,727
All right?

409
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:16,166
Gavin Verheek?

410
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:19,753
This is Darby Shaw.
Do you know who I am?

411
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:22,631
We have a mutual friend.

412
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:25,551
Thomas gave you a copy of my theory.

413
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:26,927
Yes, he did.

414
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:28,512
Where is it?

415
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:32,516
I read it and I showed it
to some folks at the Bureau...

416
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:34,893
...who sent it to Director Voyles.

417
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:37,688
Has it been seen outside of the FBI?

418
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:39,857
I can't answer that.

419
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:42,901
Then I won't tell you
what's happened to Thomas.

420
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:46,363
Okay, yes.

421
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,701
It's been seen outside the FBI,
but by whom I don't know.

422
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,203
He's dead, Gavin.

423
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:56,707
He was murdered. Someone planted
a car bomb for both of us.

424
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:59,459
I got lucky, but they're after me.

425
00:41:01,712 --> 00:41:04,047
What's your phone number?
Where are you?

426
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,883
Not so fast.

427
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,720
Come on! Thomas Callahan
was my best friend.

428
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:14,224
I'll have agents pick you up.
You can't stay on the street.

429
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:18,312
Thomas is dead because he talked
to you. Tell that to Voyles.

430
00:41:18,562 --> 00:41:21,899
VERHEEK'S WIFE: Turn up the TV,
I can't hear Regis and Kathie Lee.

431
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:27,237
Down.

432
00:41:32,826 --> 00:41:33,994
Mr. President.

433
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:39,917
Sit down. You must see this.
We've been working on this all morning.

434
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,793
You have your first audience.

435
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:44,421
Over. Roll over.

436
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:47,257
Roll over.

437
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:49,927
How serious is this Pelican thing?

438
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:53,222
I've assigned 14 agents in New Orleans.

439
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:56,934
I doubt if there's anything to it,
but we must check it out.

440
00:41:57,267 --> 00:41:58,977
I don't have to tell you...

441
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:02,814
...how much trouble and pain
this nonsense could cause...

442
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:04,983
...if the press gets wind of it.

443
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:08,612
Oh, well, you got half of it.
Good boy.

444
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:12,741
I just wish...

445
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,368
...that you'd...

446
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:16,453
...back off the thing...

447
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:18,497
I mean...

448
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:20,874
...it's a goose chase.

449
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:24,127
Are you asking me to ignore a suspect,
Mr. President?

450
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:27,798
If the press...

451
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:30,884
...gets wind of what you're after
and starts digging, I'll be-

452
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:32,344
We'll be crucified.

453
00:42:37,808 --> 00:42:39,977
So you're asking me to back off?

454
00:42:43,981 --> 00:42:46,483
Back off and chase the real suspects.

455
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:49,987
Ignore it for a few weeks, that's all.

456
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:55,492
Your hatchet man did a real number on me
with the press. They ate my lunch...

457
00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:57,202
...over the security...

458
00:42:57,494 --> 00:42:59,913
...we provided Jensen and Rosenberg.

459
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:06,086
Get that pit bull off my ass and
I'll forget the Pelican theory a while.

460
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:28,312
May I have your card?

461
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:31,982
I'll pay with cash.

462
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:35,652
Verheek.
Yes.

463
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:39,239
What did Voyles say?

464
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,035
Mr. Voyles has been unavailable.

465
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:46,163
But I will try to speak to him
later this afternoon.

466
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:51,043
I expected more.

467
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:54,004
There's a memorial service tomorrow.

468
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:56,465
I'll be there tonight.

469
00:45:56,673 --> 00:45:58,342
I think we should meet.

470
00:45:58,842 --> 00:46:01,261
Darby, I can save your life.

471
00:46:02,179 --> 00:46:04,515
You can't even talk to the director.

472
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:09,353
Where will you stay?

473
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:12,523
At the Westin, by the river.

474
00:46:15,192 --> 00:46:16,485
Okay.

475
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:46,390
She's watching TV.

476
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:50,310
GIMINSKl: They've been looking under
rocks. She's using credit cards.

477
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:52,521
She'll be dead in 48 hours.

478
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:54,523
I'll give her 72.

479
00:46:55,899 --> 00:46:57,609
GIMINSKl:
We'll meet at 6 A.M.

480
00:46:58,068 --> 00:46:59,152
All right, Bob.

481
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:02,531
Hooten, stay.

482
00:47:08,745 --> 00:47:12,249
This means her little brief
is right on point.

483
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:15,460
Will you notify the president?

484
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:18,338
GIMINSKY:
Notifying the president...

485
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,632
...means notifying Coal.

486
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:24,761
Gray Grantham's article
in tomorrow's Washington Herald...

487
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:27,639
...maintains that, according
to unnamed White House sources...

488
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:30,309
...the Mid-Eastern terrorist, Khamel...

489
00:47:30,601 --> 00:47:35,105
...may be among those who assassinated
Justices Rosenberg and Jensen.

490
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:40,068
Those sources say that a country known
for sponsoring terrorist activity...

491
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:41,695
...may have hired Khamel.

492
00:47:47,492 --> 00:47:48,577
It's Garcia.

493
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:51,663
I'm on the corner of
Pennsylvania Avenue and First.

494
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:56,293
Take down my license number;
there's a lot of gray Volvos out there.

495
00:47:56,627 --> 00:47:58,170
8-5-6...

496
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,381
...V-N-N.

497
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:04,635
Right.

498
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:06,470
Ten minutes.
GARCIA: Yes.

499
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:15,312
My keys!

500
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:22,903
GARCIA:
I can't do it.

501
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:28,158
Let's get together anyway.

502
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:33,121
You'll feel better if we meet
and you don't have to reveal anything.

503
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,165
I have a wife and daughter.

504
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:38,252
There's a chance they know that I know.

505
00:48:38,502 --> 00:48:39,753
The guys at the firm?

506
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:42,714
I didn't tell you I was in a firm.

507
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:46,176
You go to work too early
to be a government lawyer.

508
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:49,638
You must work at a firm
where they expect people...

509
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:51,932
...to work at least 100 hours a week.

510
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:16,915
Garcia, we can work this thing out
if you just get together with me.

511
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,251
Garcia?

512
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:22,296
Who's this?

513
00:49:22,713 --> 00:49:24,464
Is this Gray Grantham?

514
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:26,300
Yes. Who's this?

515
00:49:27,593 --> 00:49:29,970
Have you heard of the Pelican Brief?

516
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:31,722
The what?

517
00:49:32,306 --> 00:49:33,891
Pelican Brief.

518
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:38,729
No. Never heard of it.

519
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:43,192
It's an unlikely little theory
about who killed Rosenberg and Jensen.

520
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,736
A friend of mine took it to Washington.

521
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:49,072
He gave it to a friend in the FBI
and it was passed around.

522
00:49:49,281 --> 00:49:51,825
My friend was killed in a car bomb.

523
00:49:52,576 --> 00:49:53,827
Wait now.

524
00:49:54,745 --> 00:49:57,289
Your friend took it to the FBI...

525
00:49:57,581 --> 00:50:00,000
...and then he was killed?
What's his name?

526
00:50:01,752 --> 00:50:03,587
I can't tell you that.

527
00:50:04,588 --> 00:50:06,757
How do you know all this?

528
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:08,926
I wrote the brief.

529
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:12,262
Are you a lawyer?

530
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:13,764
No.

531
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:16,725
Where are you calling from?

532
00:50:17,768 --> 00:50:20,771
I'd rather you not
ask me any more questions.

533
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,273
You called me.

534
00:50:23,482 --> 00:50:24,775
What's your name?

535
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:27,945
- Alice.
- You called me, Alice.

536
00:50:29,363 --> 00:50:33,534
Can you get a list of the major
presidential campaign contributors?

537
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:37,287
Yes. Sure.
I can have it tomorrow.

538
00:50:38,956 --> 00:50:41,124
You know who did these killings?

539
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,293
Yes.

540
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:47,631
Let's cut to the chase.
Who did it?

541
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:50,551
Let's take it slow.
I'll be in touch.

542
00:50:50,801 --> 00:50:51,802
When?

543
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:27,087
Hi.

544
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:28,338
How are you?

545
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:30,674
How are you?

546
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:34,511
Did you get into my apartment?

547
00:51:35,846 --> 00:51:37,222
Your computer's gone.

548
00:51:38,432 --> 00:51:39,850
So are your floppy disks.

549
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,352
And your red expandable files.

550
00:51:44,855 --> 00:51:46,940
I need you to do me a favor.

551
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:50,611
Go to the memorial service tomorrow...

552
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:56,200
...and spread the word I called to say
I'm staying with an aunt in Denver.

553
00:51:56,825 --> 00:51:59,036
And I won't be back until fall.

554
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:02,956
What is going on?

555
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:09,880
Are you okay about money?

556
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:13,926
I have the money my father left me.

557
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:18,388
Who are you hiding from?

558
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:26,063
I think you better go now, Alice.

559
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:36,490
It would be better for me if you go now.

560
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:56,093
That's not fair.

561
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,763
The prettiest girl in the Quarter,
the saddest girl in the Quarter.

562
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:05,018
I can't get you to give me a smile?

563
00:53:10,524 --> 00:53:11,775
I saw that.

564
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:13,610
That's something.

565
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:23,787
Just one beer?
No.

566
00:53:26,123 --> 00:53:28,208
I've found my mission in life.

567
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,918
To make you smile.

568
00:53:30,127 --> 00:53:32,171
You must find another mission.

569
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:42,055
Wait!

570
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,642
Will you marry me,
just for 5 minutes?

571
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:49,313
I know it's stupid,
but I think we're fated for each other.

572
00:53:49,521 --> 00:53:50,981
I must go now.

573
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:54,234
Please, you're not going to
walk out on me, are you?

574
00:53:54,735 --> 00:53:56,862
I'd walk a million miles

575
00:53:57,154 --> 00:53:59,072
For one of your smiles

576
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:00,657
You beautiful

577
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:02,159
You wonderful girl

578
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:04,745
From the laundry

579
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:09,166
You've got the wrong girl.

580
00:54:12,085 --> 00:54:13,170
Go get her.

581
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:45,619
Please, help me!

582
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:35,752
Looking for Mr. Sneller.

583
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:37,129
Mr. Sneller?

584
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:39,965
Yes, Mr. Edwin F. Sneller.

585
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:34,853
FRIEND:
Have you heard from Darby?

586
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:36,313
Yes, I did.

587
00:56:36,647 --> 00:56:40,192
I got a note from her.
She's staying with an aunt in Colorado.

588
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:43,529
But she's going to
be back next semester.

589
00:56:55,499 --> 00:56:56,834
I'll see you later.

590
00:57:23,151 --> 00:57:24,862
Gavin, it's Darby.

591
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:28,866
I'd just about given up on you.

592
00:57:29,867 --> 00:57:32,744
Tell me where you want to meet
and I'll come with 3 agents.

593
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:35,163
I thought the FBI was not involved.

594
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:38,458
It's not involved, not yet.
I have friends.

595
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:42,045
We can get you out of the city tonight,
in Washington tomorrow.

596
00:57:42,296 --> 00:57:44,715
I promise you'll meet Voyles.

597
00:57:44,923 --> 00:57:46,300
We'll go from there.

598
00:57:47,176 --> 00:57:49,928
At noon tomorrow,
take the trolley to Riverwalk.

599
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,722
Wait, Riverwalk?

600
00:57:52,472 --> 00:57:55,475
Wear a long sleeve shirt
and a red baseball cap.

601
00:57:56,393 --> 00:57:59,229
Wait on the riverside
at the bandstand...

602
00:57:59,438 --> 00:58:01,064
...and I'll find you.

603
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:03,233
The riverside bandstand.

604
00:58:05,235 --> 00:58:07,321
- How tall are you?
-5'10".

605
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:08,614
Your weight?

606
00:58:09,198 --> 00:58:11,783
About 180,
but I'm planning on losing it.

607
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:13,785
I'll see you tomorrow.

608
00:58:14,077 --> 00:58:15,204
Tomorrow.

609
01:00:36,136 --> 01:00:37,721
Gavin, it's Darby.

610
01:00:38,263 --> 01:00:40,224
I'd just about given up on you.

611
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:44,478
Tell me where you want to meet
and I'll come with 3 agents.

612
01:00:45,896 --> 01:00:48,565
I thought the FBI was not involved.

613
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:50,776
It's not involved, not yet.

614
01:00:51,485 --> 01:00:53,070
I have friends.

615
01:00:53,403 --> 01:00:56,740
We'll get you out of the city tonight,
in Washington tomorrow.

616
01:00:57,616 --> 01:00:59,993
I promise you'll meet Voyles.

617
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:02,120
We'll go from there.

618
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:06,083
At noon tomorrow,
take the trolley to Riverwalk.

619
01:01:07,918 --> 01:01:10,087
Wear a long sleeve shirt
and a red baseball cap.

620
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:14,258
Wait on the riverside at the bandstand
and I'll find you.

621
01:01:14,925 --> 01:01:16,677
The riverside bandstand?

622
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:21,390
- How tall are you?
-5'10".

623
01:01:21,598 --> 01:01:22,766
Your weight?

624
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:25,769
About 180,
but I'm planning on losing it.

625
01:01:27,271 --> 01:01:28,313
All right.

626
01:01:33,402 --> 01:01:35,112
Tell me where you want to meet...

627
01:01:37,698 --> 01:01:39,533
Tell me where you want to meet...

628
01:01:40,117 --> 01:01:42,995
...and within an hour
I'll come get you with 3 agents.

629
01:05:18,669 --> 01:05:21,004
Mr. Sneller on line 2.

630
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:28,512
Khamel is dead.
We don't know who did it.

631
01:05:29,137 --> 01:05:30,931
- And the girl?
- She's running.

632
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:33,475
We lost her.
We'll find her.

633
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:51,702
There's been another murder.

634
01:05:52,202 --> 01:05:56,623
You remember my friend gave
the brief to a friend at the FBI?

635
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,627
The FBI friend was killed yesterday.

636
01:06:02,546 --> 01:06:03,672
How do you know?

637
01:06:05,257 --> 01:06:07,759
I was holding his hand.
He was shot...

638
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:10,345
...in broad daylight
in a crowd.

639
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:13,515
I'm very sorry.

640
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:16,560
I'm in New York now.
When can you come?

641
01:06:16,852 --> 01:06:20,189
You'll have to give me
something I can confirm.

642
01:06:20,564 --> 01:06:25,402
We get crank calls from people claiming
to know who killed Rosenberg and Jensen.

643
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:27,988
Something you can confirm?

644
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:29,239
Please.

645
01:06:29,656 --> 01:06:31,074
Such as?

646
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:35,037
The name of the friend
that was murdered in the car explosion.

647
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:40,292
Take your time.

648
01:06:42,169 --> 01:06:43,378
Callahan.

649
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:47,007
His first name?

650
01:06:47,257 --> 01:06:48,342
Thomas.

651
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:50,594
Where did it happen?

652
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:54,389
In New Orleans.
I think that should be enough.

653
01:06:57,392 --> 01:06:58,435
All right.

654
01:07:01,188 --> 01:07:05,108
What's the name of the friend
that worked at the FBI?

655
01:07:05,776 --> 01:07:07,194
Verheek.

656
01:07:07,694 --> 01:07:09,196
Gavin Verheek.

657
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:11,698
Voyles' Chief Counsel.

658
01:07:12,324 --> 01:07:14,201
I think that's more than enough.

659
01:07:16,453 --> 01:07:18,288
I'll be on a plane this afternoon.

660
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:21,124
You must follow my instructions.

661
01:07:35,347 --> 01:07:36,807
This is Gray Grantham.

662
01:07:39,726 --> 01:07:40,853
That's right.

663
01:07:45,148 --> 01:07:46,149
Got it.

664
01:08:02,749 --> 01:08:04,751
Did you follow my instructions?

665
01:08:05,669 --> 01:08:07,171
Yes.

666
01:08:37,826 --> 01:08:39,661
You must think I'm crazy.

667
01:08:41,288 --> 01:08:42,664
Yes, I did...

668
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,877
...till I checked New Orleans.

669
01:08:47,503 --> 01:08:49,296
Callahan was...

670
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:51,548
...killed exactly as you said.

671
01:08:51,924 --> 01:08:55,469
I also checked Verheek.
According to the FBI...

672
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:58,222
...they found his body 2 days ago...

673
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:00,849
...in a hotel room early in the morning.

674
01:09:02,935 --> 01:09:05,437
He'd been dead for at least 8 hours.

675
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:08,815
That can't be.

676
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:13,320
Want to talk about the brief?

677
01:09:15,948 --> 01:09:18,659
Everyone I've told
about the brief is dead.

678
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:21,578
I'll take my chances.

679
01:09:22,913 --> 01:09:26,208
You can't, under any circumstances,
use my name...

680
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:29,419
...or reveal how you got
the information.

681
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:32,965
Or publish anything until
I've left the country. Agreed?

682
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:35,425
Unless I can convince you otherwise.

683
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:36,927
You can't.

684
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:41,974
May I sit down?

685
01:09:45,936 --> 01:09:47,729
Mind if I use a tape recorder?

686
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:01,869
Interesting read, isn't it?

687
01:10:03,996 --> 01:10:05,414
What'd the president say?

688
01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:08,625
He spoke to Voyles...

689
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:12,379
...who will leave it alone for a while.

690
01:10:13,297 --> 01:10:15,883
The president asked Voyles to back off?

691
01:10:16,508 --> 01:10:20,470
We thought it was just another shot
in the dark. Now I'm not sure.

692
01:10:20,971 --> 01:10:22,806
That's obstruction of justice.

693
01:10:23,056 --> 01:10:25,017
Assuming the brief turns out to be true.

694
01:10:26,268 --> 01:10:28,395
If it does, you'll be the fall guy.

695
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:33,901
I won't be the only one.

696
01:10:34,568 --> 01:10:36,486
The old Nixon two-step.

697
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:38,989
Don't even think that name.

698
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:42,492
Look at the hopeful side,
Irangate, Iraqgate...

699
01:10:42,743 --> 01:10:44,661
Good chance it won't come out.

700
01:10:46,038 --> 01:10:47,664
What's up with Grantham?

701
01:10:48,624 --> 01:10:51,460
We got his car phone.
We haven't been inside the home yet.

702
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:53,587
Why not?

703
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:57,007
We almost got caught
by the cleaning lady.

704
01:11:01,428 --> 01:11:03,847
Grantham knows about the brief.

705
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:06,850
He called 3 White House aides today...

706
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:09,019
...and God knows who else.

707
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:12,814
What made you hone in
on this particular case so quickly?

708
01:11:14,358 --> 01:11:18,529
I remembered this piece
that "Frontline" did a year ago...

709
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:23,659
...about the young lawyer
who originally filed the suit.

710
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:29,873
They said he'd committed suicide,
but his family thought it was foul play.

711
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:38,298
After the assassinations,
I called his family.

712
01:11:38,549 --> 01:11:42,553
They said he had
a depressive problem years before...

713
01:11:42,803 --> 01:11:45,472
...but medication had taken care of it.

714
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:49,726
His doctor confirmed
what the family said.

715
01:11:50,894 --> 01:11:54,356
They told the police
they were not convinced it was suicide.

716
01:11:57,693 --> 01:11:59,862
But the police
closed the investigation.

717
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:03,740
Exactly.

718
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,624
That's it.
That's the brief.

719
01:12:17,129 --> 01:12:18,630
Maybe we could...

720
01:12:19,131 --> 01:12:21,425
...finish up in the morning?

721
01:12:33,145 --> 01:12:35,439
I'll be up late going over my notes...

722
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:37,399
...while they're fresh in my head.

723
01:12:39,693 --> 01:12:41,028
Call me when you wake up.

724
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:46,742
Try and get some sleep.

725
01:12:55,918 --> 01:12:56,919
Mr. Grantham.

726
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:03,175
I know it sounds silly, but...

727
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:07,137
...would you sleep on the sofa?

728
01:13:11,975 --> 01:13:13,185
No problem.

729
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:21,568
Good night.

730
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:24,196
Listen...

731
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:27,616
At the risk of sounding old-fashioned...

732
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:30,911
...isn't it time I knew your real name?

733
01:13:33,705 --> 01:13:34,998
Darby Shaw.

734
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:39,211
What made you pick me,
Darby Shaw?

735
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:44,675
Callahan was a fan.

736
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:57,855
Does the name Victor Mattiece
mean anything to you?

737
01:13:58,522 --> 01:13:59,523
Money.

738
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:00,732
Power.

739
01:14:01,733 --> 01:14:03,026
Influence.

740
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:08,991
He's made and lost several
fortunes drilling oil in Louisiana.

741
01:14:10,492 --> 01:14:11,994
In 1979...

742
01:14:12,536 --> 01:14:16,540
...his oil company punched some holes
in Terrebonne Parish and hit oil.

743
01:14:16,832 --> 01:14:18,000
A lot of oil.

744
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,044
He needed governmental permission...

745
01:14:21,295 --> 01:14:25,507
...to dredge a channel though
the marshlands to get the oil out.

746
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:29,136
Enter Mattiece,
the great campaign contributor...

747
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,054
...and as night follows day...

748
01:14:31,305 --> 01:14:34,850
...government permission
to gouge through the endangered marshes.

749
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,771
Mattiece is that close
to at least a billion dollars...

750
01:14:40,022 --> 01:14:41,273
...when Green Fund...

751
01:14:41,648 --> 01:14:43,650
...an obscure environmental outfit...

752
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:48,071
...trots down to the U.S. District court
in Lafayette and files a lawsuit...

753
01:14:48,322 --> 01:14:50,574
...to stop the entire operation.

754
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:54,369
Of course, Mattiece spares no expense
to win the lawsuit.

755
01:14:54,786 --> 01:14:59,166
I don't think there's a top law firm
between Houston and New Orleans...

756
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:01,210
...that he hasn't hired.

757
01:15:01,877 --> 01:15:03,837
Fucking PBS!

758
01:15:04,296 --> 01:15:06,882
By the time the Green Fund lawyers...

759
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:08,175
...all two of them...

760
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:10,344
...wade in, the joint ventures...

761
01:15:10,594 --> 01:15:13,764
...limited partnerships
and corporate associations...

762
01:15:14,014 --> 01:15:17,184
...form an impenetrable maze
that makes Mattiece invisible.

763
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:20,604
Luckily for the Green Fund's lawsuit...

764
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:25,400
...the heart of the new oil reserve
is near a natural refuge for waterfowl:

765
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:30,239
Osprey, egrets, pelicans,
ducks, cranes, geese.

766
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:33,033
The pelican becomes the hero.

767
01:15:33,283 --> 01:15:37,746
After 30 years of contamination
by DDT and other pesticides...

768
01:15:38,622 --> 01:15:41,375
...the Louisiana brown pelican is
on the brink of extinction.

769
01:15:41,959 --> 01:15:44,962
Green Fund seizes the bird
and enlists experts...

770
01:15:45,254 --> 01:15:48,131
...from around the country
to testify on its behalf.

771
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:53,345
It takes 7 years for the pelican suit
to go to trial in Lake Charles.

772
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:57,808
The 3-man jury, caring less
about the pelicans than jobs...

773
01:15:58,058 --> 01:16:00,143
...votes in favor of Mattiece.

774
01:16:01,228 --> 01:16:05,357
But the judge rules to keep the
injunction against drilling because...

775
01:16:05,649 --> 01:16:08,819
...he thinks Green Fund has proven
its point about the pelican...

776
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:13,282
...a federally-protected species,
and that it will appeal.

777
01:16:13,657 --> 01:16:14,992
What's the lawsuit's status?

778
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:17,870
From the trial level...

779
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:21,999
...it will be appealed to the Court
of Appeals in New Orleans in a month.

780
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:25,419
Any idea what the court will do?

781
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:27,379
It could be reversed.

782
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:32,467
Then the fun starts. If either side
is unhappy with the court...

783
01:16:32,676 --> 01:16:34,845
...they can appeal
to the Supreme Court.

784
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:39,308
From today, how long would it take
for a decision by the Supreme Court?

785
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:42,019
Anywhere from 3 to 5 years.

786
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:44,146
Rosenberg would have died.

787
01:16:44,396 --> 01:16:48,650
But another president could be
in the White House when he died.

788
01:16:48,901 --> 01:16:50,402
So if you're Mattiece...

789
01:16:50,694 --> 01:16:53,697
...and you don't mind killing
a couple of Supremes...

790
01:16:53,947 --> 01:16:57,659
...now's the time to kill them,
when you can predict their replacement.

791
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:59,203
But why Jensen?

792
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:02,664
He shared one piece
of common ground with Rosenberg:

793
01:17:02,915 --> 01:17:04,541
Protecting the environment.

794
01:17:47,251 --> 01:17:48,752
I didn't mean to wake you.

795
01:17:57,553 --> 01:18:02,266
You said that Mattiece hired law firms
from Houston to New Orleans.

796
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:05,435
Were there any in Washington?

797
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:07,563
Maybe two.

798
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:11,400
White & Blazevich...

799
01:18:14,278 --> 01:18:16,780
...and Brim, Stearns & Somebody.

800
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,241
Great!

801
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:22,619
I got a call from a lawyer in D.C...

802
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:25,122
...who saw something
concerning Rosenberg and Jensen.

803
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:29,084
He backed out of our meeting.
I never heard from him again.

804
01:18:30,294 --> 01:18:33,422
He gave me a phony name,
but I got his picture.

805
01:18:34,131 --> 01:18:35,132
How?

806
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:39,887
Long story. If he works at one of these
law firms, he could be our confirmation.

807
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:42,639
I hope you find him.

808
01:18:44,474 --> 01:18:46,268
Come with me to Washington.

809
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:49,813
I've had enough.

810
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,568
If you're right about Mattiece,
then there'll be a cover-up.

811
01:18:54,818 --> 01:18:56,111
It'll probably work.

812
01:18:56,612 --> 01:18:57,779
How do you know?

813
01:18:58,405 --> 01:19:01,033
I called the Herald morgue last night.

814
01:19:01,617 --> 01:19:04,411
Two years ago, a reporter
did a piece...

815
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:07,915
...on "Violations of
Campaign Financing Laws. "

816
01:19:08,415 --> 01:19:12,336
He found out that, hidden under
a lot of other names of individuals...

817
01:19:12,628 --> 01:19:17,341
...and PAC's and corporations,
Mattiece was the biggest contributor...

818
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:18,842
...by far...

819
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:20,802
...to the president's campaign.

820
01:19:21,094 --> 01:19:24,806
We ran a picture, with the article,
of the president and Mattiece.

821
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:28,018
It was taken unbeknownst to either one.

822
01:19:28,352 --> 01:19:31,772
In it, the president and Mattiece are
in front of Mattiece's hunting lodge...

823
01:19:32,022 --> 01:19:34,775
...sipping on some bourbon,
having a good laugh.

824
01:19:35,025 --> 01:19:36,527
The best of pals.

825
01:19:36,777 --> 01:19:39,530
The captions said:
"The President's Most Secret...

826
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:42,366
...and Generous Contributor. "

827
01:19:43,867 --> 01:19:47,621
Now if your brief is right
and it ever reaches the light of day...

828
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:50,457
...the president loses
any chance of reelection.

829
01:19:50,707 --> 01:19:53,377
The men around the president
won't let that happen.

830
01:19:53,627 --> 01:19:57,840
I checked with my sources.
The Bureau, Langley, the White House...

831
01:19:58,090 --> 01:20:00,676
...all said the brief doesn't exist.

832
01:20:02,678 --> 01:20:07,349
You may be the only witness to the fact
there is a brief. If you disappear...

833
01:20:07,599 --> 01:20:09,101
...so does justice.

834
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:14,857
Is that what Callahan would want?

835
01:20:18,485 --> 01:20:20,904
He'd want me to see my 25th birthday.

836
01:20:22,906 --> 01:20:24,241
Darby.

837
01:20:24,658 --> 01:20:28,829
If this thing reaches as deep
and goes as high as we think it does...

838
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:31,498
...they'll do anything
not to be exposed.

839
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,918
Where can you hide?

840
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,879
Go back to Washington.

841
01:20:46,638 --> 01:20:50,434
They're all shook up
about you asking about something.

842
01:20:50,601 --> 01:20:51,602
I expected that.

843
01:20:51,852 --> 01:20:54,563
It's like the Gestapo over there.
Coal clears everything.

844
01:20:54,771 --> 01:20:57,191
They put me on medical leave
for 90 days.

845
01:20:57,524 --> 01:20:59,651
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

846
01:20:59,943 --> 01:21:03,405
One thing I do know,
I've never seen it this bad.

847
01:21:03,655 --> 01:21:05,574
I'm worried about you, son.

848
01:21:09,953 --> 01:21:11,580
Gray, it's Darby.

849
01:21:11,788 --> 01:21:14,958
When you hear this, I'll be in the air
on my way to nowhere.

850
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:19,171
Try to understand.

851
01:21:20,756 --> 01:21:22,758
I can't keep you on that story.

852
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:24,801
I'm sending you to Arkansas.

853
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:26,970
The Times, the networks...

854
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:30,849
...are there checking out the judge
they're about to nominate.

855
01:21:31,016 --> 01:21:32,017
I need more time.

856
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:33,602
For what?

857
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:38,774
You lost your White House sources,
you've lost Garcia and the girl.

858
01:21:38,982 --> 01:21:40,776
Not your best week.

859
01:21:41,652 --> 01:21:43,570
You can't take me off this story.

860
01:21:45,656 --> 01:21:47,074
What do you know for fact?

861
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:50,827
An unidentified guy says
he knows about the assassinations.

862
01:21:51,078 --> 01:21:55,624
He works in a law firm, you don't know
which one. He's cut off all contact.

863
01:21:55,832 --> 01:21:58,001
That's not very promising.

864
01:21:58,502 --> 01:22:00,921
There's something there, I can smell it.

865
01:22:02,089 --> 01:22:06,844
Evidence based on olfactory prowess is
inadmissible, in case you didn't know.

866
01:22:07,135 --> 01:22:08,428
Then there's a girl...

867
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:11,473
...with her bird brief for which
you can't get confirmation.

868
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,641
Not yet.

869
01:22:12,808 --> 01:22:16,770
She also cut off contact, something
that's reaching epidemic proportions.

870
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:18,856
They're waiting for you upstairs.

871
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:23,485
Everything she said about
the two deaths has been confirmed.

872
01:22:23,735 --> 01:22:26,780
The FBI says Verheek was killed
in some hotel mugging.

873
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:29,032
- That's what you told me.
- That's what they told me.

874
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:32,452
And they said they knew of
no connection with the assassinations.

875
01:22:32,703 --> 01:22:35,622
What else would they say?
I'm interested in what they did say.

876
01:22:37,165 --> 01:22:39,251
Let's look at what I have confirmed.

877
01:22:39,877 --> 01:22:43,672
Callahan was killed.
He was a professor. They had an affair.

878
01:22:43,881 --> 01:22:46,967
Give it to the Times-Picayune.
Maybe they want some gossip.

879
01:22:47,217 --> 01:22:49,887
I also found that Callahan clerked
for Rosenberg 20 years ago.

880
01:22:50,137 --> 01:22:52,264
Life is filled with odd coincidence.

881
01:22:52,556 --> 01:22:54,141
Not a coincidence if the brief-

882
01:22:54,391 --> 01:22:56,685
You have no confirmation
there is a brief.

883
01:22:56,894 --> 01:22:59,229
I confirmed Verheek and Callahan
were friends.

884
01:22:59,521 --> 01:23:03,734
They met here a few weeks ago,
when he must have given him the brief.

885
01:23:03,984 --> 01:23:06,486
- Supposition again.
- I've confirmed the pelican lawsuit.

886
01:23:06,737 --> 01:23:10,699
On which she has based her suppositions.
It's all just suppositions.

887
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:13,535
You know what Mattiece could do?

888
01:23:13,785 --> 01:23:15,704
I know what he has done already.

889
01:23:15,913 --> 01:23:17,581
He has a bizarre history.

890
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:20,918
So do I, according to my ex-wife. It
doesn't mean that I killed the Justices.

891
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:23,253
But it means it's worth exploring.

892
01:23:25,172 --> 01:23:30,093
Go down to that crappy cabin of yours
on the weekend, hole up, retrench.

893
01:23:30,344 --> 01:23:35,057
Prove you have a way to revitalize
this story, and I might keep you on it.

894
01:23:37,184 --> 01:23:40,187
But if I were you, I'd check
where to eat in Little Rock.

895
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:50,197
This is the story of
a mystery that may never be solved.

896
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:54,201
The story of a brilliant young lawyer
who loved this land...

897
01:23:54,451 --> 01:23:57,955
...and wanted to fight to preserve it
from the inroads of man...

898
01:23:58,288 --> 01:23:59,790
...until his abrupt death...

899
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,959
...a few months ago.

900
01:24:03,377 --> 01:24:07,589
His body was found in a lonely cottage,
near the Louisiana bayou he loved.

901
01:24:08,048 --> 01:24:10,092
There was a bullet in his head...

902
01:24:10,342 --> 01:24:12,052
...and a gun beside him.

903
01:24:12,845 --> 01:24:15,848
The coroner and police
have deemed it a suicide.

904
01:24:16,598 --> 01:24:20,143
But he died sitting at a computer,
surrounded by his notes...

905
01:24:20,435 --> 01:24:23,063
...for what he called
the case he was born to win.

906
01:24:24,982 --> 01:24:27,067
His friends and family ask...

907
01:24:27,317 --> 01:24:30,153
...would anyone commit suicide
in such a manner...

908
01:24:30,404 --> 01:24:31,780
...at such a time?

909
01:24:33,115 --> 01:24:36,285
Tonight, Frontline explores
a young idealist's death.

910
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:27,669
Who's there?

911
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:31,006
It's Darby!

912
01:25:51,735 --> 01:25:53,195
I got your message.

913
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:59,076
If they bugged your phone,
they'd think I'd left the country.

914
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:08,210
Did you find that lawyer in D.C.?

915
01:26:08,961 --> 01:26:10,045
Not yet.

916
01:26:10,879 --> 01:26:13,257
My editor wants to take me
off the story.

917
01:26:15,175 --> 01:26:16,969
I could help you find him.

918
01:26:20,347 --> 01:26:21,473
How'd you find me?

919
01:26:23,392 --> 01:26:25,519
I called your editor.

920
01:26:27,229 --> 01:26:28,730
He told you?

921
01:26:31,984 --> 01:26:36,738
I told him I was your sister Mary
from out of town and couldn't find you.

922
01:26:39,783 --> 01:26:41,618
How'd you know I had a sister Mary?

923
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:45,873
You're not the only one doing research.

924
01:27:12,983 --> 01:27:15,152
It was a beautiful service.

925
01:27:15,485 --> 01:27:18,113
Thank you, Mr. President.

926
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:32,461
I'll have an announcement
after the weekend.

927
01:27:42,346 --> 01:27:46,016
It was the right thing to do,
no matter where the body was found.

928
01:27:54,191 --> 01:27:56,360
You can't announce
the nominations next week.

929
01:27:56,652 --> 01:27:58,779
You said they'd be vetted this weekend.

930
01:27:59,029 --> 01:28:00,781
There must be a change in plans.

931
01:28:01,031 --> 01:28:02,574
I don't understand.

932
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:04,826
The Pelican Brief.

933
01:28:06,954 --> 01:28:08,872
What about the Pelican Brief?

934
01:28:09,164 --> 01:28:11,834
I thought that was ancient history.

935
01:28:12,084 --> 01:28:15,087
We believe that Grantham's
gotten ahold of it.

936
01:28:15,838 --> 01:28:18,799
Mattiece will sue them
if they try to publish that.

937
01:28:19,049 --> 01:28:20,300
Not if it's true.

938
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,475
You think it's true?

939
01:28:29,226 --> 01:28:31,478
I know what Grantham will write:

940
01:28:31,979 --> 01:28:34,022
"A man who gave
the president millions...

941
01:28:34,231 --> 01:28:37,192
...had two Supreme Court Justices killed
so the president...

942
01:28:37,401 --> 01:28:40,070
...could appoint
more reasonable judges...

943
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,489
...so his oil could be harvested. "

944
01:28:43,115 --> 01:28:47,578
If Voyles says you told him to back off
the case, we face an obstruction charge.

945
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:49,329
Oh, Jesus!

946
01:28:52,666 --> 01:28:54,668
There's a way to handle this.

947
01:28:54,918 --> 01:28:56,211
Handle it how?

948
01:28:57,671 --> 01:29:00,132
We appoint two nature-lovers
to the court.

949
01:29:01,049 --> 01:29:05,053
Good environmentalists
who'd kill Mattiece and his oil field.

950
01:29:05,512 --> 01:29:09,141
Meet with Voyles, in the presence
of the Attorney General...

951
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:12,060
...and demand an investigation
into Mattiece.

952
01:29:12,269 --> 01:29:15,022
I'll leak the brief
to every reporter in town.

953
01:29:15,272 --> 01:29:17,649
Then we ride out the storm.

954
01:29:18,233 --> 01:29:22,946
But there has to be some way to keep
this information from coming out.

955
01:29:23,197 --> 01:29:24,531
I'm working on it.

956
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:28,076
What?
How?

957
01:29:28,285 --> 01:29:29,536
Mr. President...

958
01:29:30,078 --> 01:29:31,413
...you don't want to know.

959
01:29:42,591 --> 01:29:44,384
What's this all about?

960
01:29:44,635 --> 01:29:46,470
A trip to Mt. Vernon will do you good.

961
01:29:46,762 --> 01:29:48,138
Are you losing it?

962
01:29:48,972 --> 01:29:51,934
First I order you to go to Little Rock,
you refuse to go.

963
01:29:52,184 --> 01:29:55,145
You refuse to tell me why,
then you order me...

964
01:29:55,395 --> 01:29:57,314
...your boss, I might add...

965
01:29:57,606 --> 01:30:00,734
...to drop everything
and meet you at George's place.

966
01:30:01,318 --> 01:30:03,695
I thought of making you unemployed...

967
01:30:03,987 --> 01:30:05,989
...but you'd sue me for discrimination.

968
01:30:06,281 --> 01:30:07,449
She's here.

969
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:09,993
- The bird girl?
- She's here.

970
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:13,330
- You could've told me.
- Not wise.

971
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:17,084
By the way, refusing to tell me
where you could be reached...

972
01:30:17,334 --> 01:30:19,086
...didn't leave a good impression.

973
01:30:19,336 --> 01:30:22,089
It's too risky to go to my apartment
or to the job.

974
01:30:22,339 --> 01:30:24,758
- Where have you been?
- In a little hotel.

975
01:30:25,008 --> 01:30:27,719
This is a hell of a time
to punch notches in your belt.

976
01:30:28,011 --> 01:30:31,265
We're not in the same hotel.
She's helping me find Garcia.

977
01:30:31,515 --> 01:30:34,017
It sounds like she's in control.

978
01:30:34,309 --> 01:30:35,602
It's the only way she'd play.

979
01:30:36,186 --> 01:30:38,146
So what if you can't find Garcia?

980
01:30:38,355 --> 01:30:40,190
We go to plan B.
What's that?

981
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,527
We attack the lawyers directly.
What if it's another firm?

982
01:30:43,777 --> 01:30:45,112
We go to plan C.
What's that?

983
01:30:45,362 --> 01:30:47,531
We didn't go that far.
What if you do?

984
01:30:48,031 --> 01:30:50,450
I must be able to get in touch with you.

985
01:30:52,035 --> 01:30:56,665
I'm at the Marbury Hotel, room 833.
Don't use my name.

986
01:30:56,999 --> 01:30:58,250
Write it down.

987
01:31:00,377 --> 01:31:02,379
You mind getting off at the next exit?

988
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:03,755
Why?

989
01:31:04,339 --> 01:31:07,134
A tan car's been two cars behind us...

990
01:31:07,467 --> 01:31:10,012
...since we got on the parkway.

991
01:31:29,281 --> 01:31:31,158
I thought it was following us.

992
01:31:31,408 --> 01:31:32,409
Right.

993
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:17,412
Georgetown Law School, please.

994
01:32:24,211 --> 01:32:25,212
Hurry.

995
01:33:31,945 --> 01:33:33,780
Meet me by the stacks.

996
01:33:47,794 --> 01:33:49,630
Someone was in my room.

997
01:33:51,715 --> 01:33:53,634
Did you tell anyone where you were?

998
01:33:53,884 --> 01:33:56,303
Smith Keen, but he'd never repeat it.

999
01:33:56,803 --> 01:33:58,555
Did you tell him by phone?

1000
01:33:58,805 --> 01:33:59,932
No.
We were...

1001
01:34:01,642 --> 01:34:03,018
We were in his car.

1002
01:34:03,644 --> 01:34:05,437
Georgetown Law Center.
Placement Office, please.

1003
01:34:05,604 --> 01:34:07,564
One moment, please.
Placement Office.

1004
01:34:07,856 --> 01:34:11,151
This is Susan Johnson.
I'm a partner with White & Blazevich.

1005
01:34:11,401 --> 01:34:15,155
We're trying to reconstruct
some payroll records.

1006
01:34:15,405 --> 01:34:19,576
May I have the names of your students
that clerked here last summer?

1007
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:23,413
I'm from White & Blazevich.
You have something for me?

1008
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:28,252
Would you sign this, please?

1009
01:34:34,883 --> 01:34:37,469
- Thank you, Mr. Stevens.
- You're welcome.

1010
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:40,180
I'll call these five and see who's home.

1011
01:34:40,514 --> 01:34:44,560
I'll take the two with no phone number
and get their class schedules.

1012
01:34:50,774 --> 01:34:51,900
See you later.

1013
01:34:57,531 --> 01:35:00,993
I'm from the Washington Herald.
I'm looking for...

1014
01:35:01,243 --> 01:35:03,704
- ... Robert Akers and Laura Kaas.
- Is there a problem?

1015
01:35:03,954 --> 01:35:05,956
No.
Just a few questions I want to ask.

1016
01:35:06,915 --> 01:35:08,500
Are they in class this morning?

1017
01:35:10,586 --> 01:35:12,421
One moment, please.

1018
01:35:19,636 --> 01:35:20,637
Excuse me.

1019
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:22,514
Do you have ID?

1020
01:35:24,808 --> 01:35:28,020
Could I speak to Dennis Maylor, please?

1021
01:35:29,021 --> 01:35:30,480
KEITH:
No, I'm Keith Maylor.

1022
01:35:31,064 --> 01:35:33,275
I'm sorry to bother you.

1023
01:35:38,614 --> 01:35:42,492
Akers has Criminal Procedure,
Kaas has Administrative Law.

1024
01:35:42,743 --> 01:35:46,580
I'll try to find them. Maylor,
Reinhart and Wilson were all at home.

1025
01:35:46,830 --> 01:35:48,332
I can go to Maylor's.

1026
01:35:50,959 --> 01:35:52,002
Excuse me.

1027
01:35:52,294 --> 01:35:56,840
- Do you know Laura Kaas?
- She's the girl with the red backpack.

1028
01:36:02,513 --> 01:36:06,350
Do you recognize this man?
He's a lawyer at White & Blazevich.

1029
01:36:07,476 --> 01:36:09,061
We're down to Akers and Linney.

1030
01:36:09,436 --> 01:36:10,687
Linney's phone was disconnected.

1031
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:13,065
I'll get his class schedule.

1032
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,108
I'll keep looking for Akers.

1033
01:36:15,776 --> 01:36:16,985
It's me again.

1034
01:36:17,778 --> 01:36:20,489
I need the class schedule
for Edward Linney.

1035
01:36:20,697 --> 01:36:22,366
I'm sorry, Mr. Grantham.

1036
01:36:22,699 --> 01:36:27,287
A student you talked to called
White & Blazevich, who called the Dean.

1037
01:36:27,871 --> 01:36:30,582
No more class schedules for reporters.

1038
01:36:41,969 --> 01:36:43,136
Mr. Grantham.

1039
01:36:44,805 --> 01:36:46,098
I know Edward.

1040
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:51,103
He's dropped out of school for a while.
Personal problems.

1041
01:36:51,687 --> 01:36:52,855
Where is he?

1042
01:36:53,146 --> 01:36:55,858
His parents put him
in a private hospital.

1043
01:36:56,567 --> 01:36:58,610
He's being detoxified.

1044
01:37:00,696 --> 01:37:02,990
Look, he's a good guy.

1045
01:37:04,658 --> 01:37:06,493
Parklane Hospital.

1046
01:37:31,268 --> 01:37:32,436
Good afternoon.

1047
01:37:34,188 --> 01:37:35,647
May I see Edward Linney?

1048
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:38,609
- What room is he in?
- What's your name?

1049
01:37:38,942 --> 01:37:41,778
Gray Grantham, Washington Herald.

1050
01:37:42,362 --> 01:37:44,615
The law school said I could see him.

1051
01:37:45,407 --> 01:37:46,617
RECEPTIONIST:
I'm sorry they did.

1052
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:51,079
We run this hospital
and they run their law school.

1053
01:37:52,664 --> 01:37:54,082
May I see your administrator?

1054
01:37:55,709 --> 01:37:57,461
I'll see if I can find him.

1055
01:38:22,986 --> 01:38:24,404
Mr. Grantham.

1056
01:38:24,655 --> 01:38:26,281
Great architecture.

1057
01:38:26,907 --> 01:38:28,825
I'm sorry, Mr. Grantham.

1058
01:38:29,076 --> 01:38:31,787
ADMINISTRATOR: Visitation
is only allowed on the weekend...

1059
01:38:32,246 --> 01:38:33,789
...and then only family.

1060
01:38:34,498 --> 01:38:36,625
When will he be discharged?

1061
01:38:36,834 --> 01:38:39,336
ADMINISTRATOR:
I'm afraid that's confidential.

1062
01:38:40,838 --> 01:38:43,340
Perhaps when his insurance expires?

1063
01:38:45,634 --> 01:38:47,511
Do you recognize that man?

1064
01:38:49,346 --> 01:38:50,430
What's his name?

1065
01:38:51,932 --> 01:38:54,268
That's the point, I don't know.

1066
01:38:55,853 --> 01:38:57,521
What is his name?

1067
01:39:01,441 --> 01:39:04,862
He works in the oil and gas section
on the 9th floor.

1068
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:11,702
Morgan.

1069
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:15,372
Yes. Morgan.

1070
01:39:16,248 --> 01:39:18,000
His first name's something like...

1071
01:39:18,166 --> 01:39:20,502
...Charles, but that's not it.

1072
01:39:21,545 --> 01:39:24,047
I can't tell you how grateful I am.

1073
01:39:26,842 --> 01:39:28,844
When you opened the door...

1074
01:39:30,345 --> 01:39:32,055
...I thought I was hallucinating.

1075
01:39:34,057 --> 01:39:35,475
I'm sorry.

1076
01:39:36,977 --> 01:39:39,479
I'll take a hallucination like that...

1077
01:39:40,063 --> 01:39:41,398
...anytime.

1078
01:39:44,318 --> 01:39:45,569
Take care of yourself.

1079
01:39:50,532 --> 01:39:53,368
SECURITY:
Excuse me, miss. What are you doing?

1080
01:39:54,411 --> 01:39:55,704
Visiting my brother.

1081
01:39:55,913 --> 01:39:57,331
Who is your brother?

1082
01:39:57,581 --> 01:39:58,582
Edward Linney.

1083
01:40:00,501 --> 01:40:01,793
This your sister?

1084
01:40:08,008 --> 01:40:09,092
Yes.

1085
01:40:09,885 --> 01:40:11,345
Leave her alone.

1086
01:40:12,804 --> 01:40:14,806
Mom will come on the weekend.

1087
01:40:15,307 --> 01:40:16,308
Sis?

1088
01:40:17,309 --> 01:40:18,602
Come back soon.

1089
01:40:18,936 --> 01:40:20,312
I'll try.

1090
01:40:21,271 --> 01:40:25,317
I know you'd agree with me about
the horrendous cost of health care.

1091
01:40:25,567 --> 01:40:27,069
ADMINISTRATOR:
Of course, of course.

1092
01:40:27,361 --> 01:40:31,365
We pride ourselves on our
enlightened policy regarding payment.

1093
01:40:31,615 --> 01:40:33,534
Thank you very much for your time.

1094
01:40:36,787 --> 01:40:40,624
We'll be happy to have you back
on any of our normal visiting days.

1095
01:40:45,337 --> 01:40:47,840
Curtis Morgan, oil and gas.

1096
01:40:58,934 --> 01:41:00,477
White & Blazevich, please.

1097
01:41:00,769 --> 01:41:02,980
Second floor.
Use the escalator.

1098
01:41:24,668 --> 01:41:25,669
RECEPTIONIST:
May I help you?

1099
01:41:25,878 --> 01:41:28,422
Dorothy Blythe, to see Curtis Morgan.

1100
01:41:30,632 --> 01:41:33,051
Have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

1101
01:42:07,711 --> 01:42:10,964
- You have a meeting with Mr. Morgan?
- Yes. At 5.

1102
01:42:11,548 --> 01:42:13,926
- When was your appointment?
- Two weeks ago.

1103
01:42:14,218 --> 01:42:15,719
May I ask why?

1104
01:42:16,094 --> 01:42:18,722
Obviously, I need an oil and gas lawyer.

1105
01:42:20,057 --> 01:42:21,725
Curtis Morgan is dead.

1106
01:42:24,186 --> 01:42:25,395
Why didn't anyone call me?

1107
01:42:26,188 --> 01:42:28,607
We have no record of your appointment.

1108
01:42:29,733 --> 01:42:30,776
What happened?

1109
01:42:31,443 --> 01:42:33,737
He was mugged a week ago.

1110
01:42:33,946 --> 01:42:36,114
Shot by street punks, we believe.

1111
01:42:36,406 --> 01:42:38,200
Do you have some identification?

1112
01:42:39,409 --> 01:42:40,702
He's Security.

1113
01:42:40,911 --> 01:42:42,496
Security for what?

1114
01:42:43,497 --> 01:42:46,208
Come with us,
you should see someone else.

1115
01:42:46,416 --> 01:42:50,838
After this treatment, I have no interest
in talking to anyone in this firm.

1116
01:43:07,938 --> 01:43:09,940
They killed him!

1117
01:43:18,031 --> 01:43:19,449
I can't breathe!

1118
01:43:35,966 --> 01:43:38,468
It's all right.
Just let it go.

1119
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:39,803
Let it go.

1120
01:43:44,892 --> 01:43:46,185
It's all right.

1121
01:43:53,984 --> 01:43:57,196
We ran the story about a week ago.
It's just another mugging.

1122
01:43:57,487 --> 01:43:59,907
Didn't make the Metro front page.

1123
01:44:00,199 --> 01:44:01,533
Curtis Morgan...

1124
01:44:01,825 --> 01:44:04,328
...225 Willow Road, Bethesda.

1125
01:44:04,912 --> 01:44:07,289
225 Willow Road...

1126
01:44:07,831 --> 01:44:09,333
...Bethesda.

1127
01:44:09,833 --> 01:44:11,210
That's what I wanted.

1128
01:44:11,543 --> 01:44:15,214
Report in before noon tomorrow.
We're nervous over here.

1129
01:44:16,089 --> 01:44:17,299
You know...

1130
01:44:17,674 --> 01:44:19,676
...good help is hard to find.

1131
01:44:26,725 --> 01:44:28,352
I'm going with you.

1132
01:44:32,814 --> 01:44:34,191
Look at me.

1133
01:44:43,033 --> 01:44:44,868
I want you to leave.

1134
01:44:47,871 --> 01:44:50,707
And if you need confirmation
for your story?

1135
01:44:51,542 --> 01:44:52,876
I'm on my own.

1136
01:44:56,713 --> 01:44:58,715
What's changed your mind?

1137
01:45:02,553 --> 01:45:04,721
I want you to reach 25.

1138
01:45:11,353 --> 01:45:12,855
I'm coming.

1139
01:45:41,258 --> 01:45:42,634
Good evening.

1140
01:45:42,926 --> 01:45:45,429
I'm Grantham of the Herald.
This is my assistant.

1141
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:49,933
- Could we see Mrs. Morgan?
- I'm her father. She won't talk.

1142
01:45:50,601 --> 01:45:54,021
I respect her privacy.
I know she's been through an ordeal.

1143
01:45:54,938 --> 01:45:57,774
When did you people
ever respect anyone's privacy?

1144
01:45:58,984 --> 01:46:03,280
I feel that way about most reporters.
But her husband called me...

1145
01:46:04,031 --> 01:46:05,991
...3 times before he died.

1146
01:46:06,450 --> 01:46:08,827
I believe his death
wasn't accidental.

1147
01:46:10,621 --> 01:46:13,415
She doesn't want to talk.
Get the hell out of here.

1148
01:46:16,627 --> 01:46:18,212
You change your mind...

1149
01:46:19,046 --> 01:46:20,839
...I'll be at this number.

1150
01:47:29,241 --> 01:47:32,494
Mr. Grantham?
Yes.

1151
01:47:33,203 --> 01:47:35,122
This is Mrs. Morgan.

1152
01:47:36,707 --> 01:47:39,209
Do you still want to see me?

1153
01:47:42,045 --> 01:47:44,298
Did you know your husband called me?

1154
01:47:48,010 --> 01:47:51,054
No. How would he know
anything about those dead judges?

1155
01:47:51,889 --> 01:47:54,016
I have no idea.

1156
01:47:55,058 --> 01:47:56,768
Did he keep any...

1157
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:59,104
...unusual documents...

1158
01:47:59,396 --> 01:48:00,522
...or papers?

1159
01:48:02,065 --> 01:48:05,402
We have a lock box at the bank
for deed and wills.

1160
01:48:06,904 --> 01:48:10,782
I looked at it last Thursday.
There was nothing unusual in it.

1161
01:48:12,743 --> 01:48:14,578
On Saturday morning...

1162
01:48:14,786 --> 01:48:16,914
...I was going through his...

1163
01:48:18,749 --> 01:48:20,834
...desk in the bedroom.

1164
01:48:22,044 --> 01:48:24,171
I found something a bit unusual.

1165
01:48:26,423 --> 01:48:27,466
A key.

1166
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:30,844
A key to what?

1167
01:48:32,763 --> 01:48:34,473
Another lock box.

1168
01:48:36,433 --> 01:48:37,559
Which bank?

1169
01:48:39,102 --> 01:48:40,854
Riggs Bank.

1170
01:48:44,441 --> 01:48:46,109
We've never banked there.

1171
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:49,196
And you knew nothing
about this other...

1172
01:48:49,988 --> 01:48:51,073
...box?

1173
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:52,950
Not until Saturday morning.

1174
01:48:53,575 --> 01:48:55,327
I figured...

1175
01:48:56,119 --> 01:48:58,497
...I'll run by when I felt up to it.

1176
01:48:59,790 --> 01:49:01,959
Maybe you should check it, Mrs. Morgan.

1177
01:49:04,461 --> 01:49:06,588
Could be a clue to who killed him.

1178
01:49:07,965 --> 01:49:10,592
Are you saying Curtis was killed...

1179
01:49:10,801 --> 01:49:13,846
...because he knew something
about the assassinations?

1180
01:49:14,137 --> 01:49:16,306
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1181
01:49:17,307 --> 01:49:22,104
Do you think there
may be papers in the safe-deposit box...

1182
01:49:22,312 --> 01:49:25,899
...that may reveal what Curtis knew
about the assassinations?

1183
01:49:26,483 --> 01:49:28,360
There could be.

1184
01:49:31,029 --> 01:49:33,323
My child's lost one parent.

1185
01:49:37,494 --> 01:49:39,413
I can't let her lose another.

1186
01:49:41,999 --> 01:49:43,500
I'll check it for you.

1187
01:49:44,251 --> 01:49:46,336
No one has to know you have the key.

1188
01:49:50,924 --> 01:49:53,343
They will only give it to his wife.

1189
01:49:53,635 --> 01:49:56,054
My partner's a woman.
She's trustworthy.

1190
01:49:57,848 --> 01:49:59,391
I would have one condition.

1191
01:49:59,683 --> 01:50:04,438
If you find something that disparages
my husband in any way, you can't use it.

1192
01:50:05,063 --> 01:50:07,441
You have my word, Mrs. Morgan.

1193
01:51:42,452 --> 01:51:44,246
Where are the safe-deposit boxes?

1194
01:51:44,454 --> 01:51:45,747
SECURITY:
Down those steps.

1195
01:53:07,204 --> 01:53:09,206
I need access to a box, please.

1196
01:53:09,456 --> 01:53:11,542
- The number, please?
-616.

1197
01:53:14,586 --> 01:53:18,590
- This box was rented two weeks ago.
- Yes.

1198
01:53:18,882 --> 01:53:21,760
- I assume you're Mrs. Morgan?
- Sara Ann Morgan.

1199
01:53:22,094 --> 01:53:24,847
- The address?
-225 Willow Road, Bethesda.

1200
01:53:26,223 --> 01:53:29,768
- Phone number?
-301-555-7128.

1201
01:53:30,561 --> 01:53:32,062
Who rented this box?

1202
01:53:32,271 --> 01:53:35,065
- My husband, Curtis D. Morgan.
- And his social security number?

1203
01:53:40,737 --> 01:53:43,156
510-96-8686.

1204
01:53:44,867 --> 01:53:46,577
Will you sign here, please?

1205
01:53:47,286 --> 01:53:48,370
May I help you?

1206
01:53:48,579 --> 01:53:50,455
I'd like to rent a box.

1207
01:53:50,747 --> 01:53:53,750
Will you have a seat?
I'll be with you in a minute.

1208
01:53:55,627 --> 01:53:56,628
You have a key?

1209
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:58,255
Yes, I do.

1210
01:54:00,424 --> 01:54:01,758
Follow me.

1211
01:55:42,860 --> 01:55:44,862
It's a four-page affidavit...

1212
01:55:45,112 --> 01:55:47,698
...signed under oath.

1213
01:55:47,906 --> 01:55:51,034
It's dated the day before
the last time he called me.

1214
01:55:53,871 --> 01:55:58,709
He worked at White & Blazevich
in the oil and gas section for 5 years.

1215
01:56:00,002 --> 01:56:01,128
Listen to this!

1216
01:56:01,378 --> 01:56:02,713
During that time...

1217
01:56:03,005 --> 01:56:07,551
...he worked for a client who
was engaged in a lawsuit in Louisiana.

1218
01:56:07,801 --> 01:56:10,888
The client was a man
named Victor Mattiece...

1219
01:56:11,221 --> 01:56:12,723
...who he's never met.

1220
01:56:13,056 --> 01:56:17,019
Lots about the lawsuit,
how desperate Mattiece was to win it.

1221
01:56:17,227 --> 01:56:18,896
Just as if you wrote it.

1222
01:56:20,731 --> 01:56:23,734
A partner named Sims Wakefield...

1223
01:56:23,942 --> 01:56:28,155
...supervised the case for W & B.
Morgan worked on a peripherated case.

1224
01:56:28,572 --> 01:56:32,117
He took files and documents
that Wakefield left for him...

1225
01:56:32,409 --> 01:56:34,036
...not related to the case.

1226
01:56:34,244 --> 01:56:38,916
When he got back to his own office, he
found a memo on the bottom of the stack.

1227
01:56:39,124 --> 01:56:42,252
He'd inadvertently taken it
from Wakefield's desk.

1228
01:56:42,544 --> 01:56:45,422
A copy of the memo
is attached to the affidavit.

1229
01:56:45,797 --> 01:56:50,260
He copied the memo and left the memo
under the files on his desk.

1230
01:56:50,469 --> 01:56:52,763
Next stop, Washington Herald!

1231
01:56:55,432 --> 01:56:57,267
No! Stop!
Get out of the car!

1232
02:00:12,129 --> 02:00:15,883
EDITOR: There was a car explosion
in a garage near the Riggs Bank.

1233
02:00:16,258 --> 02:00:19,303
The police traced the car
to a leasing agency.

1234
02:00:20,095 --> 02:00:22,639
It was rented yesterday by Grantham.

1235
02:00:25,058 --> 02:00:27,144
Have you heard from Grantham?

1236
02:00:28,187 --> 02:00:29,980
Not since yesterday.

1237
02:00:31,982 --> 02:00:33,650
I should've taken him off that story.

1238
02:00:34,651 --> 02:00:35,652
What story?

1239
02:00:38,989 --> 02:00:40,824
See what you can find.

1240
02:01:02,095 --> 02:01:03,430
Smith Keen...

1241
02:01:04,014 --> 02:01:05,682
...meet Darby Shaw.

1242
02:01:07,768 --> 02:01:09,645
So, Mr. Grantham...

1243
02:01:09,811 --> 02:01:11,688
...what the hell is going on?

1244
02:01:21,865 --> 02:01:24,826
Sweetheart, I'm down here
in the basement.

1245
02:01:26,453 --> 02:01:28,580
It's about two in the morning.

1246
02:01:31,208 --> 02:01:32,459
This is...

1247
02:01:33,335 --> 02:01:34,378
...an affidavit...

1248
02:01:37,047 --> 02:01:39,716
...concerning a memo
I found on my desk.

1249
02:01:41,176 --> 02:01:45,013
I'm going to trust you
to do with it what you will.

1250
02:01:46,056 --> 02:01:49,393
The memo's from Velmano,
he's a senior partner.

1251
02:01:52,271 --> 02:01:55,399
It was dated September 28th...

1252
02:01:56,733 --> 02:01:59,528
...addressed to Wakefield and it read:

1253
02:01:59,736 --> 02:02:02,364
"Sims, advise client
research is complete.

1254
02:02:03,073 --> 02:02:06,910
The bench will sit much softer
if the old man is retired.

1255
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:11,290
The second retirement is a bit unusual.
Jensen, of all people.

1256
02:02:12,249 --> 02:02:15,752
Advise further that the pelican
should arrive here in 4 years...

1257
02:02:16,003 --> 02:02:18,088
...assuming other factors. "

1258
02:02:19,047 --> 02:02:20,382
There's no signature.

1259
02:02:21,508 --> 02:02:24,511
Then Justices Rosenberg and Jensen
were killed.

1260
02:02:27,389 --> 02:02:30,893
I firmly believe that this is
the work of Mattiece and his associates.

1261
02:02:31,226 --> 02:02:34,021
Memo doesn't mention Mattiece,
but it refers to a client.

1262
02:02:34,271 --> 02:02:36,440
Wakefield had no other clients.

1263
02:02:36,815 --> 02:02:39,318
And no client had as much to gain
from the new court.

1264
02:02:41,778 --> 02:02:46,241
I thought that I was protecting us
by not revealing what I found.

1265
02:02:47,284 --> 02:02:50,537
You'll only see this if I'm gone,
so I will have failed.

1266
02:02:52,789 --> 02:02:54,333
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

1267
02:02:59,254 --> 02:03:01,089
I'll always be with you.

1268
02:03:03,342 --> 02:03:04,593
Always.

1269
02:03:07,638 --> 02:03:11,350
This is Marty Velmano. What a pleasure!
What can I do for you?

1270
02:03:12,184 --> 02:03:14,978
We're doing a story
about Victor Mattiece...

1271
02:03:15,979 --> 02:03:20,108
...and his involvement in the deaths
of Rosenberg and Jensen.

1272
02:03:20,609 --> 02:03:25,197
Great! We'll sue you for the next 20
years. You'll be named as a defendant.

1273
02:03:25,489 --> 02:03:27,574
Oh, this will be great.

1274
02:03:27,824 --> 02:03:30,327
Victor Mattiece will own the Herald.

1275
02:03:30,577 --> 02:03:34,498
Have you heard of the Pelican Brief?
We have a copy of it.

1276
02:03:35,165 --> 02:03:39,086
We also have a copy of a memo
sent by you to Sims Wakefield...

1277
02:03:39,336 --> 02:03:43,841
...in which you suggest your client's
position would be greatly improved...

1278
02:03:44,132 --> 02:03:48,136
...by the removal of Rosenberg
and Jensen from the court.

1279
02:03:48,679 --> 02:03:51,014
I noticed you waited till five.

1280
02:03:51,223 --> 02:03:54,393
An hour earlier, we could've
run to court, stopped this.

1281
02:03:54,977 --> 02:03:56,895
You deny you wrote the memo?

1282
02:04:00,315 --> 02:04:02,317
It's a fabrication.

1283
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:05,404
You have no lawsuit, Mr. Velmano.

1284
02:04:06,196 --> 02:04:07,531
You know it.

1285
02:04:07,906 --> 02:04:09,533
You son of a bitch!

1286
02:04:12,703 --> 02:04:14,162
Mr. Coal?

1287
02:04:14,496 --> 02:04:17,624
Have you read the Pelican Brief?
I have.

1288
02:04:17,916 --> 02:04:22,212
We're running a story which verifies
the facts set forth in that brief.

1289
02:04:22,504 --> 02:04:25,674
We've confirmed Mattiece
contributed over $4 million...

1290
02:04:25,924 --> 02:04:27,885
...to the president's last campaign.

1291
02:04:28,177 --> 02:04:30,512
4,200,000, all through legal channels.

1292
02:04:30,721 --> 02:04:31,805
That's right.

1293
02:04:31,972 --> 02:04:36,226
We believe the White House tried
to obstruct the FBI investigation...

1294
02:04:36,518 --> 02:04:39,188
...and we wonder
if there are any comments.

1295
02:04:39,396 --> 02:04:42,649
The White House denies
any direct or indirect involvement...

1296
02:04:42,941 --> 02:04:45,194
...in this investigation.

1297
02:04:45,903 --> 02:04:48,238
You've received some bad information.

1298
02:04:56,163 --> 02:04:58,290
Mr. Voyles, it's Grantham.

1299
02:04:59,708 --> 02:05:02,419
We're running a story
detailing a conspiracy...

1300
02:05:02,669 --> 02:05:04,922
...in the murders of
Rosenberg and Jensen.

1301
02:05:05,214 --> 02:05:09,259
We're naming Mattiece, an oil
speculator, and two of his lawyers.

1302
02:05:09,593 --> 02:05:13,472
We believe the FBI knew about Mattiece,
but didn't investigate...

1303
02:05:13,764 --> 02:05:17,267
...at the urging of the White House.
Any comments?

1304
02:06:29,464 --> 02:06:32,551
I think we'll have great
success with these people.

1305
02:06:32,843 --> 02:06:35,512
They were really very pleased...

1306
02:06:35,846 --> 02:06:38,182
...and genuinely cooperative.

1307
02:06:38,765 --> 02:06:40,017
What's up?

1308
02:07:24,102 --> 02:07:25,312
You know Gray Grantham.

1309
02:07:27,606 --> 02:07:29,525
And this is Darby Shaw.

1310
02:07:37,616 --> 02:07:40,827
So you're the little lady
who started this great brouhaha.

1311
02:07:42,371 --> 02:07:45,582
I think you have me confused
with the president's friend.

1312
02:07:46,834 --> 02:07:50,420
I have some comments,
for the record.

1313
02:07:59,388 --> 02:08:02,099
First, we got the Pelican Brief
two weeks ago...

1314
02:08:02,391 --> 02:08:05,269
...and submitted it to the White House
on the same day.

1315
02:08:05,477 --> 02:08:10,399
It was not considered high priority in
the investigation until Gavin Verheek...

1316
02:08:10,732 --> 02:08:13,777
...Special Counsel to the Director,
was found murdered.

1317
02:08:13,986 --> 02:08:17,114
Did the White House interfere
in the FBI investigation of Mattiece?

1318
02:08:18,615 --> 02:08:20,367
I'll discuss it...

1319
02:08:20,617 --> 02:08:21,910
...off the record.

1320
02:08:29,793 --> 02:08:34,464
Last Wednesday the president asked me
to ignore Victor Mattiece as a suspect.

1321
02:08:34,756 --> 02:08:36,300
In his words...

1322
02:08:36,925 --> 02:08:38,760
...he asked me to "back off. "

1323
02:08:39,678 --> 02:08:41,138
I have a tape...

1324
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:44,141
...which I will allow no one to hear...

1325
02:08:44,391 --> 02:08:47,311
...unless the president
first denies this.

1326
02:08:48,145 --> 02:08:49,646
So what do you do now?

1327
02:08:50,898 --> 02:08:54,902
There'll be a grand jury by
noon tomorrow. Quick indictments.

1328
02:08:56,278 --> 02:08:58,447
And we'll find Mattiece.

1329
02:09:00,824 --> 02:09:03,785
I'd like a few minutes alone
with Ms. Shaw.

1330
02:09:04,494 --> 02:09:06,288
If she doesn't mind.
It's her call.

1331
02:09:06,496 --> 02:09:08,415
I'd like Mr. Grantham to stay.

1332
02:09:29,186 --> 02:09:30,729
What's next for you?

1333
02:09:31,813 --> 02:09:34,316
Who killed the man disguised as Verheek?

1334
02:09:34,525 --> 02:09:37,319
Oh, you mean the assassin, Khamel.

1335
02:09:38,195 --> 02:09:41,198
Off the record, Khamel was killed
by a contract operative...

1336
02:09:41,490 --> 02:09:43,492
...hired independently by the CIA.

1337
02:09:44,535 --> 02:09:45,577
Rupert?

1338
02:09:45,869 --> 02:09:47,538
He probably has 20 names.

1339
02:09:47,746 --> 02:09:48,997
Why was he following her?

1340
02:09:50,207 --> 02:09:54,044
I think the brief initially
scared Giminski more than anyone.

1341
02:09:54,253 --> 02:09:55,754
And he probably...

1342
02:09:56,046 --> 02:09:57,130
...sent Rupert...

1343
02:09:57,297 --> 02:09:59,216
...to trail Darby...

1344
02:09:59,508 --> 02:10:02,719
...in part to watch,
and in part to protect.

1345
02:10:05,764 --> 02:10:09,226
We can help.
What do you want?

1346
02:10:11,687 --> 02:10:13,564
To leave the country, alone.

1347
02:10:16,733 --> 02:10:17,860
All right.

1348
02:10:18,402 --> 02:10:21,280
We'll get you out of here,
put you on my plane.

1349
02:10:21,613 --> 02:10:24,199
We'll fly you anywhere you want
and you can disappear.

1350
02:10:24,491 --> 02:10:27,077
But you must allow me to contact you...

1351
02:10:27,619 --> 02:10:28,912
...through Mr. Grantham...

1352
02:10:29,204 --> 02:10:32,708
...if, and only if,
it becomes urgently necessary.

1353
02:10:34,918 --> 02:10:36,211
That's fine.

1354
02:10:38,922 --> 02:10:42,217
I want no one on the plane but me,
Gray and the pilots.

1355
02:10:43,510 --> 02:10:46,054
After takeoff, I'll tell the pilot
where to go.

1356
02:10:46,722 --> 02:10:49,933
He has to file a flight plan
before he can leave.

1357
02:10:50,642 --> 02:10:53,061
You're the director of the FBI.

1358
02:10:54,104 --> 02:10:55,522
Set it up.

1359
02:14:51,466 --> 02:14:53,468
Our guest today is Gray Grantham...

1360
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:56,680
...who has, as just about everyone
in America knows...

1361
02:14:57,055 --> 02:15:01,894
...revealed the plot behind the
assassinations of Rosenberg and Jensen.

1362
02:15:02,269 --> 02:15:05,898
The ripple effects of this story
just don't seem to stop.

1363
02:15:06,190 --> 02:15:10,319
As of this broadcast, Victor Mattiece,
one of the country's richest men...

1364
02:15:10,527 --> 02:15:13,989
...has been indicted, along with
4 aides and lawyers.

1365
02:15:14,406 --> 02:15:18,535
Fletcher Coal, the president's Chief
of Staff, has resigned.

1366
02:15:18,785 --> 02:15:22,372
And we're getting strong indications
that the president himself...

1367
02:15:22,581 --> 02:15:24,041
...will not run again.

1368
02:15:24,708 --> 02:15:27,544
That's what we know.
Let's get to what we don't.

1369
02:15:28,921 --> 02:15:33,217
We know the Pelican Brief was written
by a woman named Darby Shaw...

1370
02:15:33,425 --> 02:15:35,719
...but we don't know who that is.

1371
02:15:35,928 --> 02:15:37,930
Who is Darby Shaw?

1372
02:15:40,390 --> 02:15:43,018
That's a question for Darby Shaw.

1373
02:15:43,227 --> 02:15:47,856
Next question.
Speaking for many of our colleagues...

1374
02:15:48,190 --> 02:15:50,901
...who are in a feeding frenzy to
interview her...

1375
02:15:51,193 --> 02:15:52,945
...where is Darby Shaw?

1376
02:15:53,237 --> 02:15:57,574
That's also a question for Darby Shaw.
But she's not available...

1377
02:15:57,866 --> 02:16:00,410
...to answer questions
until the feeding frenzy stops.

1378
02:16:01,245 --> 02:16:04,206
Does that mean
you don't know where she is?

1379
02:16:05,332 --> 02:16:06,542
I didn't say that.

1380
02:16:06,834 --> 02:16:08,126
Then you do know.

1381
02:16:12,339 --> 02:16:14,591
I take it this cryptic smile means...

1382
02:16:14,842 --> 02:16:16,426
...you're not answering.

1383
02:16:18,762 --> 02:16:22,057
In view of all this, you know that...

1384
02:16:22,850 --> 02:16:24,268
...there's speculation...

1385
02:16:24,476 --> 02:16:28,105
...that this woman is a figment
of your imagination.

1386
02:16:28,397 --> 02:16:32,109
That you created her
from a lot of different sources.

1387
02:16:33,068 --> 02:16:36,363
Just as there are people who believe
there was no Deep Throat...

1388
02:16:36,613 --> 02:16:39,908
...there are those who believe
there is no Darby Shaw.

1389
02:16:40,117 --> 02:16:43,620
In other words,
she's just too good to be true.

1390
02:16:44,872 --> 02:16:46,415
She almost is.
