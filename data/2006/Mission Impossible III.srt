1
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,631
<i>We've put an explosive charge
in your head.</i>

2
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,533
Does that sound familiar?

3
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,972
The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?

4
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,707
I gave it to you.

5
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,840
Ethan, where's the Rabbit's Foot?

6
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,716
Wait... What are you saying?
That wasn't it?

7
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,486
- What I gave you, was that...
- I'm going to count to 10.

8
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:03,653
You're going to tell me
where the Rabbit's Foot is or she dies.

9
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:14,070
Jules, it's going to be okay.

10
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,835
It's going to be okay.
Do you understand?

11
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,104
One.

12
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,508
You listen to me.
I got exactly what you asked for.

13
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,880
Did you want something else?

14
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,148
If there was a misunderstanding,
I will fix it.

15
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,154
I can get it, whatever you want.

16
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,416
Two.

17
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,951
Listen. Talk to me. We can talk,

18
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,853
like gentlemen.

19
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,790
- Three.
- God!

20
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,604
All right. All right, all right.

21
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,638
I know where the Rabbit's Foot is.

22
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,977
I can help you.

23
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,747
The way you helped me
on the airplane?

24
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,517
That way?

25
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,548
You put the gun down.
I'm not talking to you like this.

26
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,093
That's your choice. Four.

27
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,055
The Rabbit's Foot's in Paris.

28
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,895
You want to know where in Paris?
Then let her go.

29
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,095
- 'Cause you will not...
- It's not in Paris. Five.

30
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,633
I can get it for you.

31
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,641
But you kill her, you do this,
you get nothing.

32
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,973
- Six.
- Are you listening to me?

33
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,242
The only way you're going
to get what you want is for you to...

34
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,442
- Do you think I'm playing?
- Son of a bitch!

35
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,883
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?

36
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,818
Where is it? Where the hell is it?

37
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,389
- Look at me.
- Where the hell is it?

38
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,890
- Stay with me.
- Seven! Seven!

39
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:44,520
I am going to kill you.
I swear to God I'm going to kill you!

40
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,689
- Eight!
- No, please.

41
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,533
Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.

42
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,476
I promise you. I promise you.

43
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,242
- I can figure out how to get whatever...
- Nine.

44
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,544
Listen to me. Listen to me.

45
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,018
I want to help you.

46
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,850
I want to help you get
whatever you want.

47
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,656
But you got to do what's right.
What you know is right.

48
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,530
No. No.

49
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,333
No.

50
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,311
- Ten.
- Don't!

51
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:31,868
- Ten.
- Don't!

52
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,083
- What are you doing?
- Your brother wants another one.

53
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,846
Oh, God, no.
Ethan, that's what we talked about...

54
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,921
- I'm watching him. He's fine.
- That's how it is with Rick.

55
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,582
He's fine and then suddenly he's naked
and he's hugging everybody.

56
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,558
- I'll take full responsibility for Rick.
- You will? Full?

57
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:24,152
- Well, mostly full.
- It's a huge responsibility.

58
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,822
It's going well, right?

59
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,230
- It's going really well.
- Yeah.

60
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,064
Julia, your sister's here.

61
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,972
- Give me a hug.
- You look so beautiful.

62
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,166
I don't know about that. So, is this him?

63
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,904
- I hope so.
- Oh, come here. Oh, gosh.

64
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,576
All right. Mom's dying to see you.

65
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,706
I can't believe
you guys came all the way to Virginia.

66
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,044
Like we'd miss your engagement...

67
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:48,985
When Julia called and told me
that she was getting married,

68
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,091
I had one thought,
that it was just too bad

69
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,458
that Daddy wasn't here
to walk her down the aisle.

70
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,794
And then when Julia told me...
Thanks, Mom.

71
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,367
That Ethan doesn't have
his parents anymore, either,

72
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,265
I got really sad.

73
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,534
But it occurred to me
that this is about starting a new family

74
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,604
and how beautiful that is.

75
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,838
And I just want to say
I am making Julia an aunt,

76
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,778
so I expect the same treatment
very, very soon.

77
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,145
Cheers!

78
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:25,153
Department of Transportation?

79
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,453
I've been there over 10 years now.
Wow.

80
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,118
What do you do at the DOT?

81
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,752
I study traffic patterns.

82
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,161
You hit the brakes for a second,
just tap them on the freeway,

83
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,131
you can literally track
the ripple effect of that action

84
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,758
across a 200-mile stretch of road,

85
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,166
because traffic has a memory.

86
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,262
It's amazing. It's like a living organism.

87
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,068
Freshen that up for you?
What is it, vodka martini?

88
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,267
Yeah. Thanks.

89
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,310
Ladies, do you need...

90
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,339
- I'd marry him.
- I would, too.

91
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,283
Okay, so, a three-week
heli-boarding honeymoon?

92
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,320
- Okay, you actually get dropped...
- From a helicopter, yeah.

93
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,390
- It's how they met.
- Really?

94
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,356
- Tell her the story.
- There's no story.

95
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,052
It is a good story. Tell the story.

96
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:05,221
First of all,
no one was ever good enough for Julia.

97
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,559
Oh, here we go.

98
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,602
Not spontaneous enough,
adventurous enough, funny enough...

99
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,501
You know what? No, that's not true.
You make it sound like I've never dated.

100
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:14,630
No one we liked.

101
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,538
- That is true.
- That is true.

102
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,923
Then she goes and gets in a chopper
that takes off from this lake...

103
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,824
- What was the name of that lake?
- Lake...

104
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,298
Lake Wanaka. Wanaka.

105
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,795
Wanaka. Thank you.

106
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,665
- He heard that?
- How did he hear that?

107
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,740
And the hospital's cool
with you taking three weeks?

108
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,832
Yeah, I'm not the only nurse
employed there, you know.

109
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,800
I'm psyched that you're going
to be my brother, man.

110
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:19,929
So am I, Rick.

111
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,904
No, it's awesome.
I think it's going to be sick.

112
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,408
Me, too, man.
I just got to get the phone.

113
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,341
- You rock hard.
- Okay.

114
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,471
Hello?

115
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,674
<i>- Is this Mr. Ethan Hunt?
- Yes, it is.</i>

116
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,285
<i>This is Ready-Travel Resort Services.</i>

117
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:38,016
<i>We'd like to offer you a chance to win
an all-expense-paid trip to Mexico.</i>

118
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,734
We ran out of ice.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

119
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,109
- Oh, no. Can't somebody else go?
- No, I got it.

120
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,148
I'll be right back. Hi, Betsy.

121
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,580
Thank you.

122
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,701
$1.86.

123
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,079
Thanks for coming.
Can't decide what size Slurpee to get.

124
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,184
I usually go for the 900-ouncer.

125
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,549
How's that party? Sorry I had to call you.

126
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,648
- Yeah, you should have come.
- You should have invited me.

127
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,125
- You know I would have.
- Thanks.

128
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,725
I know we joke about it, but I am always
this close to begging you

129
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,200
to stop training our people
and get your ass back in the field.

130
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,170
But that's not what you do anymore,
and so I respect that choice.

131
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:04,403
You know I do. Family's everything.

132
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,978
Come on, John. What's going on?

133
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,648
It's Agent Farris.

134
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,279
She was on an operation.

135
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,426
She's disappeared.
Been off-grid 11 hours.

136
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:27,065
I'm sending in Search and Rescue.
I was hoping you'd want in.

137
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,203
You've got good people for that.

138
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,837
Yeah. Yep, that we do.

139
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,849
Wheels up at sunrise
if you have a change of heart.

140
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,181
Take some pictures of the party for me.

141
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,635
<i>Ethan. Three days ago,</i>

142
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,233
<i>Agent Lindsey Farris was captured
while on a surveillance operation.</i>

143
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:15,075
<i>This is the man she was tracking.
His name is Owen Davian.</i>

144
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,478
<i>Details are eyes-only,</i>

145
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,346
<i>but I can tell you
that Davian's a black-market trafficker.</i>

146
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,353
<i>Extremely dangerous
and a priority for us.</i>

147
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,417
<i>At 1400 hours today,</i>

148
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,684
<i>a recon satellite ID'd
a caravan of vehicles</i>

149
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,421
<i>with plates matching those known to
have been used by Davian's operatives.</i>

150
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,089
<i>They stopped at a derelict factory
outside Berlin.</i>

151
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,464
<i>It appears they have a hostage.
We believe it's Agent Farris.</i>

152
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,662
<i>Normally we would disavow,</i>

153
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,830
<i>but Lindsey may be the key
to getting us closer to Davian,</i>

154
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,635
<i>and that's a risk we need to take.</i>

155
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,438
<i>Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,</i>

156
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,103
<i>is to find Lindsey and bring her home.</i>

157
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,477
<i>I've already assembled a team.</i>

158
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,478
<i>I have them standing by,
awaiting your word.</i>

159
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:58,553
<i>This message, let's call it
my excellent engagement gift to you,</i>

160
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,718
<i>will self-destruct in five seconds.</i>

161
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,420
<i>Good luck, Ethan, and thanks again.</i>

162
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,539
<i>Am I ready?</i>

163
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,425
- You okay?
- Yeah.

164
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,558
Yeah.

165
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:56,145
You know, I'm sorry. I realized
I didn't tell you that the office called

166
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,449
during the party.
I have to go to Houston for a night.

167
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:03,454
METRO's having
a public transpo conference.

168
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:10,017
- It's so last-minute.
- I know.

169
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,383
Well, well, well.

170
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:42,153
Now, if it isn't
Mr. "Those Who Can't Do, Teach"

171
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,785
back in the field.

172
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,057
- What's up, baby?
- Hey, man.

173
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,459
Hey, Ethan, don't worry.
We're going to get the girl.

174
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:54,734
Or have you been away so long
you've forgotten how good we are?

175
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,667
Welcome back, brother.

176
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,467
Is our truck in place?

177
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,694
Weapons good to go?

178
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,533
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

179
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,600
You know I got your six.

180
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,141
Hey, man. That's your job.

181
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,559
<i>Guns one, activated.
Guns two, activated.</i>

182
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,660
<i>Guns three, activated.
Guns four, activated.</i>

183
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,138
<i>Guns ready.</i>

184
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,008
All four guns operational.

185
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,811
They've got men on
the second, third, fourth floors.

186
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,316
<i>I count 14 of them.</i>

187
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,548
Observer, I'm in approach position.

188
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,522
Roger that. Stand by.

189
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,926
<i>Target match.</i>

190
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,933
The prize is on the sixth floor.
Two Tangos with her.

191
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,633
Moving in.

192
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,279
<i>So, Raider One, at some point,</i>

193
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,789
we got to go over
this whole "getting married" thing.

194
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,689
Negative, Observer.

195
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,625
I don't respect you nearly enough
to have that conversation.

196
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,890
<i>You may not respect me,</i>

197
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,125
<i>but for now you're stuck
with my voice in your head.</i>

198
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,134
So, this girl,
what the hell do you see in her anyway?

199
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,399
Who, Julia? You've never met her.

200
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,406
Yeah, and the way things are,
I probably never will.

201
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,578
<i>Lucky for her, right?
That's what you're thinking.</i>

202
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,512
They've got communications gear.

203
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,583
Two Tangos, second floor,
northwest corridor.

204
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,418
Groundhog, that's you.

205
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,146
<i>You need to grab that gear
on the second floor</i>

206
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,619
<i>as soon as we go hot.</i>

207
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,213
Copy that. I'll need two minutes,

208
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,091
which means
you'll need me in one, right?

209
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,751
Yeah, just about.

210
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,193
Raider One,
make a left at the top of the stairs.

211
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,233
<i>The prize should be
at the end of the hall.</i>

212
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,879
Phoenix, I have eye on the prize.

213
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,922
Give her 10 cc's more.

214
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,361
- Call me when she wakes.
- Okay.

215
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,061
We need touchdown in less than three.
Do you copy?

216
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,600
<i>Roger that, I copy.</i>

217
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,761
Please, when do I not copy?
All I do is copy.

218
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,475
Stand by to go live. On my mark.

219
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:21,705
<i>Three.</i>

220
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,872
<i>Two.</i>

221
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,711
One. Execute.

222
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,621
<i>Warning. Warning.</i>

223
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,283
Raider One, you're clear. Move!

224
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:08,126
Lindsey. Lindsey.

225
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,056
Ethan?

226
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,689
I'm going to get you home.

227
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,501
Observer, I've got the prize.
Evac in three.

228
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,040
<i>Roger that.</i>

229
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,710
This is adrenaline.
Lindsey, you're going to feel this.

230
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,732
<i>Groundhog, second floor is clear.</i>

231
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,337
On the move!

232
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,263
Observer, we're on the move. Wrap out.

233
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,558
<i>- Evac in 90 seconds.
- Roger that.</i>

234
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,429
Phoenix, get to the LZ now.

235
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,729
Roger, Observer. On my way.

236
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,578
Ethan. I have to talk to you.

237
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,589
- Come on, come on.
- I have to talk to you right now!

238
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,785
Just for you. Turn off your transmitter.

239
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,452
Do it, Ethan!

240
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,134
Ethan!

241
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,482
- Lindsey! Moving!
- Moving!

242
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:27,824
Mag!

243
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,791
Ready to move.

244
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,725
We evac from here.

245
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,226
Get down!

246
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,128
I'm out. How many rounds you got?

247
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,803
Enough.

248
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,084
Now I'm out.

249
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,891
T minus five, baby.

250
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,497
Lindsey, hold on to me.

251
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,123
Luther!

252
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,228
Rolling!

253
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,284
God! My head! What is that?

254
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,152
- What is...
- Is she okay?

255
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,390
Lindsey! Let's get to the chopper.

256
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,023
Zhen, get rid of the truck.

257
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,465
Let's go!

258
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,838
God! What is that? You can't hear that?

259
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,745
- Oh! God!
- What's wrong with her?

260
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,578
- Let's go!
- We loaded?

261
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,948
Yeah. Let's do it! Move out!

262
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,289
Go, go, go, go, go!

263
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,811
- Son of a bitch.
- No!

264
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,283
Guys, we got company.
I'm going to try and lose them.

265
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,911
Hurts so much.

266
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,353
Turn it off. Please.

267
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,802
Please, Ethan.

268
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,119
Guys, their missiles are hot!

269
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,625
Incoming! Hold on.

270
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,703
Okay. That was lucky.
We only get one of those.

271
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,081
Do we have a defibrillator?

272
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,021
Ethan, turn it off!

273
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:49,994
Bring it on!

274
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,293
Ethan! What is it?
Did they put something in my head?

275
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,334
They injected you
with a time-release charge.

276
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,960
- Do you remember that?
- No. Time-release...

277
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,435
An explosive. They've activated it.

278
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:01,938
It's gonna detonate
unless we fry the charge,

279
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,200
- which is what we're gonna do.
- No, Ethan.

280
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,673
Zap her like that, you'll stop her heart.

281
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,336
Then I'll zap her again
and bring her back.

282
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,538
Do it!

283
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,740
Guys! They're firing another one!

284
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,184
- Ethan!
- Zhen!

285
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,760
Zhen, hold on. Hold on, hold on!

286
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,479
- I want you to set it for 150.
- 150.

287
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,315
Lindsey, I'm gonna short out
the explosive in your head.

288
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,389
- You're gonna be okay.
- It'll need 30 seconds.

289
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,954
Damn it.

290
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,256
- Twenty-five seconds!
- Come on.

291
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,158
We're almost there.

292
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:03,734
- They have us locked.
- Twenty seconds.

293
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,665
Hold on.

294
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,016
I got them!

295
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,590
- Ten seconds.
- Almost there. Almost there.

296
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,282
Give me the paddles.

297
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,862
Ethan. Thank you.

298
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,160
Shit.

299
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,395
Hey.

300
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,299
Hey.

301
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,405
How did it go?

302
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:04,914
I'm sorry. Fine. I'm sorry.

303
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,149
I'm just tired.

304
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,749
I read your training brief
on Agent Farris.

305
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,290
The words you used were
"beyond capable."

306
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,791
That still stand, Mr. Hunt?

307
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,226
- Mr. Brassel...
- Does it stand?

308
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,191
Yes, sir, it does.

309
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:50,529
Because we've got a corpse downstairs
that says otherwise.

310
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,296
Killed by a detonator

311
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,634
implanted in her skull
through the nasal cavity.

312
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,971
Mr. Brassel, it's unacceptable to judge
Agent Farris' competence based...

313
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,171
It's unacceptable
that chocolate makes you fat,

314
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,305
but I've eaten my share.
And guess what?

315
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,748
Now, I approved Agent Farris'
surveillance op

316
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,978
based on your evaluations, Mr. Hunt,

317
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,520
of a woman
who allowed herself to be captured.

318
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,592
So you go to recover her.
You encounter a dozen men.

319
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,354
You don't grab any of them?

320
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:20,090
Our objective, Mr. Brassel,
was to recover Agent Farris.

321
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,193
Davian employs a cellular structure
at his organization.

322
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,360
The men there
more than likely had no information...

323
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,462
Who's drawing these conclusions?
Is it you?

324
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:31,734
- I am, sir. Based upon...
- I'm not on you yet.

325
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,945
You allowed Farris
to board your chopper without a scan.

326
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,105
That explosive device
could have taken you all out.

327
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:41,675
There is one reason that you are sitting
here before me today, and that is luck.

328
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,086
Because your operation was
poorly conceived and executed worse.

329
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,523
- Two laptops were recovered...
- I'm aware of that.

330
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,957
We've talked to Tech Services.

331
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,427
They doubt
if they can reconstitute the drives.

332
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,795
"Crispy," I believe,
is what they called them. Worthless.

333
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,198
Mr. Brassel,
as Operation Manager of this office,

334
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,736
- I have the authority...
- Excuse me.

335
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,864
Did you just throw a title at me,
Mr. Musgrave?

336
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:06,340
I don't care if your daddy plays golf
with the President.

337
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:09,538
This is Intelligence.
So far I haven't seen any.

338
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,809
You think this op was worth the risk,
Mr. Hunt.

339
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,346
What do you know about Owen Davian?

340
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,947
He was the one
who brought gas centrifuge technology

341
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,117
to Korea from Pakistan.

342
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:26,391
He was also the man who sold Toxin
Five to the Armahad Republic Jihad.

343
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:31,063
He is a man who provides,
provides, provides!

344
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:36,066
And he remains invisible.
He's a goddamn invisible man.

345
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:39,142
Wells, not Ellison,
in case you want to be cute again.

346
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:41,007
We can't find him.

347
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:45,581
He knows it. It's emboldened him.

348
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,478
I've been trying to bring Davian down
since the day that I got here.

349
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:50,781
Do you know what I've got for it?

350
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:53,119
It's never been confirmed
the Toxin Five theft was Davian.

351
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:57,251
Mr. Musgrave, please don't interrupt me
when I'm asking rhetorical questions.

352
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,455
Your operation has achieved one thing.

353
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,761
You have reminded Davian
that he is winning.

354
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,261
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go inform Mr. And Mrs. Farris

355
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:11,240
that their baby girl was killed
in a head-on collision on l-95.

356
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,836
<i>I stand here today deeply saddened</i>

357
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,911
by the death of one of God's children,

358
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,748
Lindsey Elizabeth Farris.

359
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:27,288
It is always startling when the Lord
takes one of our young so unexpectedly.

360
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:33,454
<i>Be aggressive. Come on. Stay focused.
Keep your knees bent. Good. Good.</i>

361
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,657
<i>Now, to fire the lock,
the extractor has to be...</i>

362
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,701
<i>That bag's not going to hit you back.
Hit harder.</i>

363
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,202
<i>Don't rely on your sights.
Keep your eyes dead on the target...</i>

364
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,897
<i>Attack me. Come on.</i>

365
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,134
<i>Don't ever release the firing pin
unless the extractor's...</i>

366
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,302
<i>Good. There you go. Good.</i>

367
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:51,911
<i>Identify the target. Point and shoot.
It's very simple. You point and shoot.</i>

368
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,108
<i>Stay focused.</i>

369
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:56,210
<i>Miss Farris, you know
how many recruits I've trained.</i>

370
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,186
<i>I'm proud to say that you are the first</i>

371
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,917
<i>that I've recommended
for active field duty.</i>

372
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,390
<i>Congratulations.</i>

373
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:03,892
<i>Am I ready?</i>

374
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,193
Yes?

375
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,366
<i>Is this Mr. Kelvin?</i>

376
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,770
Yes. Who is this?

377
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,208
<i>I'm calling from Norfolk Mail Service.</i>

378
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,745
<i>Lindsey Farris
rents a post office box here.</i>

379
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,474
<i>She sent you a piece of mail from Berlin</i>

380
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,482
<i>and asked us to call you
when it arrived.</i>

381
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:28,449
<i>It came this morning.</i>

382
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,155
Thank you.

383
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,055
- This right here.
- Thanks.

384
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:58,750
<i>It's a microdot.</i>

385
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:01,181
A microdot with nothing on it.
This is unusual.

386
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,277
Lindsey wouldn't send me
a blank microdot.

387
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:04,946
I'm telling you, man, there's no image.

388
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,387
Then you're not looking
in the right place.

389
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,958
Where the hell am I supposed to look?

390
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,526
There's not much square footage
to this thing.

391
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,060
Why would Lindsey send me
a blank microdot?

392
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,925
I don't know.
Why would Lindsey send you anything?

393
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,693
You were her instructor,
not her handler.

394
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:19,427
Listen, man.
I don't mean to cross the line,

395
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:23,469
but was there something going on
between you two?

396
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,269
You and Lindsey.

397
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,301
Lindsey was like my little sister.

398
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,347
And you never

399
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,180
slept with your little sister, right?

400
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,951
Hey, brother, if I don't ask you, who will?

401
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:42,549
Maybe it's magnetic. The microdot.

402
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,055
Well, that's old school.

403
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:48,654
If she was in a hurry and only had
access to black-market gear, maybe.

404
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,996
- Could you get the tools to read it?
- I might know a guy.

405
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,502
- Magnetic means encrypted.
- Yeah, I know that.

406
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,266
Yeah. Be right there.

407
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,576
The thing about Lindsey is
she was brand-new.

408
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,839
She was sweet.
Remember when you were sweet?

409
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:06,474
- Can you remember that far back?
- Yeah, well, barely.

410
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:10,342
In Germany,
you asked me what it is I see in Julia.

411
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:13,881
What I see in Julia is life before all this.

412
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,353
And it's good.

413
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,129
Benji, what have you got?

414
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,461
Well, these hard drive platters
are just fried.

415
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,330
- Yeah.
- You know, they made a mess of them.

416
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,834
It's just like...
There's holes in them and stuff.

417
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,837
And it's got scorched
all the way through. And then...

418
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,497
Look, this one's got
a hole in it and stuff.

419
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:30,869
I can't believe. I can't even look at it.

420
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:33,170
- Benji. Did you recover anything?
- Yes. Yes.

421
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:36,178
Despite the aforementioned conditions
of the hard drive you brought back,

422
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,842
I managed to recover
portions of two dozen e-mail files.

423
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,476
Also made what I believe to be

424
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,556
a thoroughly
promotion-worthy breakthrough.

425
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,450
Your Mr. Davian is going
to arrive in Rome the day after tomorrow

426
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,586
and attend a function
at one Vatican City.

427
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,857
What the hell is Davian
doing at the Vatican?

428
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,991
It's all got to do with the "Rabbit's Foot."

429
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:58,193
Rabbit's Foot?

430
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,997
Yeah, well,
I'm assuming it's like a code word

431
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,231
for something he's about to sell
to an unspecified buyer,

432
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,935
for $850 million, by the way.
Or maybe it's not a code word.

433
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,739
Maybe it's just a really,
really expensive bunny appendage.

434
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:10,370
You have no idea what it is?

435
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:13,211
It's interesting. I used to have
this professor at Oxford, okay?

436
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:16,411
Dr. Wickham, his name was,
and he was like this massive, fat guy.

437
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,887
You know, huge, big guy.
We used to call him...

438
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,753
You know... Well, I won't tell you
what we used to call him.

439
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:23,588
He taught biomolecular kinetics
and cellular dynamics,

440
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,719
and he used to sort of
scare the underclassmen

441
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,993
with this story about how the world
would eventually be eviscerated

442
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,431
by technology.

443
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,993
You see, it was inevitable
that a compound would be created,

444
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,629
which he referred to as the "Anti-God."

445
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,004
It was like an accelerated mutator,
a sort of, you know,

446
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,170
like an unstoppable force
of destructive power

447
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,042
that would just lay waste to everything.

448
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,343
To buildings and parks
and streets and children

449
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,942
and ice cream parlors, you know?

450
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,917
So whenever I see, like,
a rogue organization,

451
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:55,686
willing to spend this amount of money
on a mystery tech,

452
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:59,160
I always assume it's the Anti-God.

453
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,527
End-of-the-world kind of stuff,
you know?

454
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,432
But, no, I don't have any idea what it is.
I was just speculating.

455
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,905
- Did you brief Musgrave on this?
- Who, me? No, not yet.

456
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,669
- Good. Don't.
- What?

457
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,539
- Don't tell anyone about this.
- This took me ages.

458
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,044
If something goes wrong
with the operation,

459
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,581
I want Musgrave to have deniability.

460
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:21,277
- That's great work, Benji.
- What operation?

461
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,554
That look in your eye
is a pain in my ass.

462
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,520
You know that, right?

463
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,489
<i>Any available resident to Pediatrics.</i>

464
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,891
<i>Any available resident to Pediatrics.</i>

465
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,564
<i>Rehabilitative Care, call the pharmacy.</i>

466
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,362
<i>Rehabilitative Care, call the...</i>

467
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,366
I have to go away again.

468
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,841
On business. Two days.

469
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,546
Two days?

470
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,777
Yeah.

471
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,393
Ethan, what's going on?

472
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,587
I keep thinking you just need time

473
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,934
to tell me whatever it is that it's...

474
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,535
But nothing in my mind makes sense.

475
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,406
Yeah.

476
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,941
What's wrong?

477
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,192
What are you not telling me?

478
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,120
I need to ask you for something.

479
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,659
And it's the most...

480
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,931
I need you to trust me.

481
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:26,507
Of course I trust you.

482
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:34,577
Am I ever going to be able
to understand what this is?

483
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:40,013
I need you to trust me.

484
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:47,323
Yes.

485
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,166
I trust you.

486
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,531
Is it...

487
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,336
Tell me it's real.

488
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,212
I mean us.

489
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:07,511
Tell me it's real.

490
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,686
Follow me.

491
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:14,556
<i>The vows you're about to take</i>

492
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:18,220
are not to be taken
without careful thought and prayer.

493
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,298
This love is not to be diminished
by difficult circumstances

494
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,495
and it is only to be dissolved by death.

495
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,371
Do you have the rings?

496
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:31,801
Yeah.

497
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,918
Repeat after me.

498
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,996
I, Julia Anne Meade...

499
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:01,262
"I, Julia Anne Meade..."

500
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,832
...hereby take Ethan Matthew Hunt...

501
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,540
"...hereby take Ethan Matthew Hunt..."

502
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,340
...to be my lawfully wedded husband.

503
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,413
"...to be my lawfully wedded husband."

504
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,733
Tomorrow may be the only time
we can predict

505
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,396
where Owen Davian is going to be.

506
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,030
Charity event. Vatican City.

507
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:40,133
Our mission is to get in
and kidnap Davian.

508
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,643
I don't know why he's so happy.

509
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,245
I did remind him
that the Vatican is the Vatican.

510
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:50,452
A 109-acre sovereign state
in the middle of Rome,

511
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:54,149
surrounded by a 60-foot wall,
which is monitored 24/7,

512
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,725
with over 200 CCTV cameras.

513
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,328
That's not even
what makes it a challenge.

514
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:04,629
Getting Davian is good.
But getting his buyers is even better.

515
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:08,794
If they realize he's been grabbed,
they'll disappear.

516
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,964
I'm sorry, what are you saying?

517
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,405
No matter how we grab Davian,

518
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,341
his clients are gonna know
he's been taken.

519
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,278
No, they won't. Access point is here.

520
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:20,674
It's a one-way street
adjacent to the Vatican wall.

521
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,981
I'll need 30 seconds.
And we'll need a truck.

522
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,649
Now we've pissed off
every Italian in Rome,

523
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,818
go do what you got to do.

524
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:06,294
- Don't forget the smoke.
- Yeah.

525
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:49,702
"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall."

526
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,676
Alpha team, this is Bravo.
Right on schedule.

527
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:09,610
<i>We should have breach in 60.</i>

528
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,348
Roger that. Charlie team, report.

529
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,982
<i>Well, I don't have anything
to report, really.</i>

530
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:20,263
Except I think I should be right on time.

531
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:21,422
We'll be waiting for you.

532
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:24,262
<i>- ETA two minutes.
- Roger that.</i>

533
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:57,493
Charlie team, did you fire the tracer yet?

534
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,200
Stand by.

535
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,153
Firing the tracer. Now.

536
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,088
Alpha, I'm in. T minus two minutes.

537
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,595
Roger that.

538
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:31,595
Charlie team, I see you.

539
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:34,468
<i>I'm looping the security feed.
Stand by to move.</i>

540
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:35,936
Roger that.

541
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,107
Video is looped. Go.

542
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:55,555
Alpha team,
catacomb video taken care of?

543
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,684
Taken care of. We're good to go.

544
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:09,537
<i>- Delta team, do you copy?
- All I do is copy.</i>

545
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:13,140
That's funny.
Get ready to move into position.

546
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,711
<i>- I'm already there.
- Really?</i>

547
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:19,906
<i>ETA 30 seconds.</i>

548
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:21,575
See you in 30.

549
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,595
Alpha team moving into position.

550
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:34,459
Bravo standing by for transmission.

551
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:37,625
Transmitting.

552
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:42,300
Got you.

553
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:58,521
Miss Onia Demea.

554
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,224
I should be on the list. Thank you.

555
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:03,656
I'm sorry. Your name is not here.

556
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,592
There must be some mistake.

557
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:15,595
Miss Demea?

558
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:17,931
Just a minute.

559
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:55,711
She made it.

560
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:18,700
We have a photo opportunity.

561
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:21,831
<i>Just give me the word. I'm standing by.</i>

562
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,566
Delta, ready for upload.

563
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,616
Delta team, download good.

564
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:56,533
Listen, man, I didn't mean to be
so cavalier the other day

565
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,164
about you getting engaged.

566
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,903
I know that. Thanks.

567
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:06,975
But a normal relationship
isn't viable for people like us.

568
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:09,882
- I don't agree with that.
- Then I'm smarter than you.

569
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:12,478
I'm going up. I agree with Luther.

570
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:16,559
We can't have real relationships.
But you see, I love that.

571
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:43,713
Twenty-three months.
That's as long as it'll last

572
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,789
when you got the baggage we do
and the lifestyle we got.

573
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,824
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

574
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:52,691
Look at me.
I know what I'm talking about.

575
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:55,764
And you know
I know what I'm talking about.

576
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:09,309
Wait here.

577
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:32,666
Davian just picked up a briefcase.

578
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,498
We're going to have to
move sooner than we thought.

579
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:38,438
<i>- Can you identify who made the drop?
- Negative. How close are you guys?</i>

580
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,601
We're just printing now.

581
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:02,160
I'm not proud of it.
I'm not happy about it,

582
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,096
but I've lived with women a few times,

583
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:06,294
and it doesn't ever make it to two years.

584
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,166
- You can't.
- Thanks for the advice,

585
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:10,796
but it's different for me
than it is for you, you know?

586
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:12,898
- I'm not in the field anymore.
- Oh, okay.

587
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,205
Here's a retirement present.

588
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,943
In our job, there's always going to be
something between you and a woman.

589
00:50:22,052 --> 00:50:23,212
Always.

590
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,548
- Luther, listen.
- Dishonesty.

591
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,351
A dishonesty that poisons everything.

592
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,119
I think I need to tell you something...

593
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:33,094
Stop talking. This isn't about you, Ethan.

594
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:37,756
And whoever this girl is, you're going to
end up messing up her life, too.

595
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:39,334
Don't do it.

596
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:43,433
Jules and I got married two days ago.

597
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,202
Congratulations.

598
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,611
Thanks. Thanks.

599
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,218
<i>- He's walking. I'm going in.
- Roger that.</i>

600
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,913
I'm on my way.

601
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:07,461
Ma'am. I need you to step back.

602
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,497
No. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

603
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,999
I always spill red wine
on my white custom-made shirt.

604
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:15,401
- Okay. Step back.
- It's fine. It's fine. Bathroom.

605
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:19,574
Tell me you're on your way.

606
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:21,371
I'm on the move.

607
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:31,580
Move it. Come on.

608
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,149
His bodyguards
are checking out the bathroom.

609
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:39,556
I'm almost there.

610
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,496
He's going in.

611
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:51,459
Quiet. Read this.

612
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:52,863
Slowly.

613
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,066
Read it.

614
00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:01,241

00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:55,354
Everything is not all right.

See you in the sewer.

00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:55,521
- She's sorry about your shirt.
- That's no problem.

640
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:02,195
Her hotel has laundry service,
and she'll happily take care of it.

You want to wash my shirt?

642
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,225
What are we going to do

She'll think of something.

645
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:16,270
She would like to drive.

646
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:17,903
Follow me to the hotel.

647
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:19,811
Sir, would you like us
to watch the case?

648
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:20,974
No.

649
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,183
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

650
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:05,060
- What's up?
- Nothing. What's up with you?

651
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,423
Nothing.

652
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:26,171
Blow the car.

653
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:30,275
Oh. It's such a nice car.

654
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,615

Send him in.

00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:10,721
Ethan Hunt and his team
just grabbed Owen Davian in Rome.

661
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:14,261
They're headed back now.
I thought you should know.

662
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,161
You were aware of this operation?

663
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:20,667
Yes, I was.

664
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:23,230
Then good work.

665
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,307
Thank you.

666
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,604
You're dead, Mr. Davian.

667
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:11,183
There were witnesses.

668
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:16,787
That was you in the bathroom.

669
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:18,622
Now, you're going to tell us everything.

670
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:21,253
Every buyer you've worked with.
Every organization.

671
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:22,626
What the hell is your name?

672
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:24,859
Names, contacts, inventory lists.

673
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,834
You have a wife, girlfriend?

674
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,140
It's up to you how this goes.

675
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:35,143
Because you know
what I'm going to do next?

676
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:37,577
I'm going to find her, whoever she is,

677
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:40,979
I'm going to find her,
and I'm going to hurt her.

678
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,621
You were apprehended carrying details

679
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:49,749
of the location of something
code named the Rabbit's Foot.

680
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:53,556
I'm going to make her bleed, and cry,
and call out your name.

681
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:57,393
And you're not going to be
able to do shit. You know why?

682
00:58:58,935 --> 00:58:59,993
What is the Rabbit's Foot?

683
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:02,367
Because you're going to be
this close to dead.

684
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:03,632
And who is the buyer?

685
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:07,232
And then I'm going to kill you
right in front of her.

686
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:10,639
- I'm going to ask you one more time.
- What's your name?

687
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:12,214
- What is the Rabbit's Foot?
- Who are you?

688
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:13,373
And who is the buyer?

689
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:15,849
You don't have any idea
what the hell is going on, do you?

690
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:20,389
I mean, you saw what I did to your
little blonde friend at the factory, right?

691
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,893
Well, that was nothing. That was

692
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:29,123
fun.

693
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:34,636
That was fun.

694
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:07,761
What is the Rabbit's Foot?

695
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:17,168
- Ethan!
- What is the Rabbit's Foot?

696
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,079
Ethan, stop!

697
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:20,615
What is it?

698
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:23,318
Don't do it!

699
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,511
- Ethan!
- What is the Rabbit's Foot?

700
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,785
You tell me!

701
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:31,553
Ethan, stop! Don't do it.

702
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,822
This isn't you, man! This isn't you!

703
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:36,693
We can use him, Ethan! You know that!

704
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,107
No, Ethan! Don't do it!

705
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:48,310
Please, stop!

706
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,170
What I'm selling,

707
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:23,869
and who I'm selling to,

708
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:29,746
is the last thing
you should be concerned about,

709
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:33,483
Ethan.

710
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:34,976
Ethan, we got it. Lindsey's microdot.

711
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,248
It's a video file.

712
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,651
<i>Ethan, I don't know what they've
told you. I don't know what you think.</i>

713
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,353
<i>Just listen to me.</i>

714
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:48,987
<i>Brassel sent me to Germany
to surveil an exchange,</i>

715
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:51,123
<i>to ID a man named Owen Davian.</i>

716
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,997
<i>I tagged his phone,
and I intercepted a transmission.</i>

717
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,470
<i>I traced the call through the
IMF network, and this is what came up.</i>

718
01:02:57,573 --> 01:03:00,633
<i>The call to Davian
came from Brassel's office.</i>

719
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:04,412
<i>It's Brassel.
I think he's working with Davian.</i>

720
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:06,482
<i>I think I'm being set up...</i>

721
01:03:20,651 --> 01:03:21,913
Ethan!

722
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,070
You all right?

723
01:04:03,689 --> 01:04:05,623
Someone call for help!

724
01:04:06,692 --> 01:04:08,990
Does anyone have a cell phone?

725
01:04:42,528 --> 01:04:44,325
Everybody, get down!

726
01:04:44,897 --> 01:04:48,196
Get down! Get down, get down!
Everybody, get down!

727
01:05:04,517 --> 01:05:06,985
- There's a woman down.
- I see her.

728
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:26,801
Get down! Get down! Stay down!

729
01:05:28,074 --> 01:05:30,668
Everybody, get down! Get down!
Stay down!

730
01:05:30,776 --> 01:05:32,141
Get down!

731
01:05:35,514 --> 01:05:36,742
Open up!

732
01:05:36,882 --> 01:05:39,180
Open up! I need the prisoner!

733
01:05:55,301 --> 01:05:56,700
Oh, my God!

734
01:05:57,403 --> 01:05:59,803
It's really bleeding.
Don't leave me, okay?

735
01:05:59,905 --> 01:06:01,839
Don't worry. I'm right here.

736
01:06:01,941 --> 01:06:04,273
Ethan, there's a G36 in the truck!

737
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:05,434
I know! I know!

738
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:38,742
Turn the drone around.
There's an IMF agent in the truck.

739
01:06:46,652 --> 01:06:48,882
Ethan! Get out of the truck!

740
01:06:56,328 --> 01:06:57,761
Ethan, move!

741
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,627
- Hello?
- Rick, this is Ethan. Is Julia home?

742
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:13,823
Hey, man. Look, I hope you're not mad
I'm here. It's just...

743
01:09:13,933 --> 01:09:15,230
Rick, I'm not mad. Is Julia home?

744
01:09:15,334 --> 01:09:17,268
I tried her cell phone,
and there was no answer.

745
01:09:17,836 --> 01:09:21,431
No. Sorry.
Hey, did your friend find you?

746
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:24,641
Which friend?

747
01:09:24,777 --> 01:09:27,371
<i>I don't know. Just some English guy.</i>

748
01:09:29,682 --> 01:09:31,047
Rick, what did you tell him?

749
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:34,017
<i>Look, it's all good, man.
I told him I didn't know where you were,</i>

750
01:09:34,119 --> 01:09:37,577
<i>and Julia might, and he should
just try her at the hospital.</i>

751
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:40,383
Hello?

752
01:09:46,498 --> 01:09:49,092
- All right, see you tomorrow, Sally.
- All right. Good night, honey.

753
01:09:56,675 --> 01:09:59,075
<i>Hi. It's Julia.
Please leave me a message...</i>

754
01:10:06,652 --> 01:10:10,611
<i>... at 4:00 today, the Chesapeake Bay
Bridge is closed in both directions.</i>

755
01:10:10,723 --> 01:10:12,554
- Sixth floor.
- Sally, this is Ethan.

756
01:10:12,658 --> 01:10:14,717
<i>- I need to talk to Julia.
- Hey, honey.</i>

757
01:10:14,827 --> 01:10:16,522
She just went downstairs.
I'll transfer you.

758
01:10:37,516 --> 01:10:38,710
Damn it!

759
01:10:39,585 --> 01:10:40,643
Excuse me.

760
01:10:40,753 --> 01:10:43,119
I was wondering if you knew
where I might find this patient.

761
01:10:43,222 --> 01:10:45,816
Probably not. But I'll know who can.

762
01:10:51,096 --> 01:10:52,563
What's that?

763
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,814
Sally. Where's Julia?

764
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:12,715
- Where's Julia?
- I think she left.

765
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:15,046
Have you tried the east building?

766
01:11:21,593 --> 01:11:23,527
- Has Julia left yet?
- I haven't seen her.

767
01:11:23,629 --> 01:11:25,859
- Mike, Mike. Have you seen Julia?
- Hey, you okay?

768
01:11:25,964 --> 01:11:27,488
- Have you seen Julia?
- No.

769
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:33,868
Watch it, buddy!

770
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:47,110
<i>- Jules?
- You hung me outside of an airplane.</i>

771
01:11:47,252 --> 01:11:49,049
<i>You can always tell
someone's character</i>

772
01:11:49,154 --> 01:11:51,679
<i>by the way they treat those
they don't need to treat well.</i>

773
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:55,692
<i>- If you hurt her, I swear...
- Don't threaten me. Just don't.</i>

774
01:11:55,794 --> 01:11:59,628
<i>The briefcase I picked up in Rome,
the one you took from me,</i>

775
01:11:59,765 --> 01:12:01,858
<i>contains the location
of the Rabbit's Foot.</i>

776
01:12:01,967 --> 01:12:05,368
<i>You're going to get it and bring it to me.
The Rabbit's Foot.</i>

777
01:12:05,471 --> 01:12:08,372
<i>Ethan, you had a watch
last time I saw you.</i>

778
01:12:08,474 --> 01:12:11,238
<i>You have 48 hours,
starting on my mark.</i>

779
01:12:11,343 --> 01:12:12,571
Wait, wait, wait.

780
01:12:12,678 --> 01:12:14,737
<i>Now, call me at this number
when you have it.</i>

781
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:17,577
<i>- Just wait.
- Julia's life for the Rabbit's Foot.</i>

782
01:12:17,683 --> 01:12:21,084
<i>- You have 48 hours, or she dies.
- Wait! Wait. Wait.</i>

783
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:28,089
<i>Condition 1-116. All units on scene.</i>

784
01:12:28,193 --> 01:12:30,127
We need you to come with us.

785
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:32,594
Just... Pete, what the hell is this?

786
01:12:32,698 --> 01:12:35,394
Sorry about that, Mr. Hunt.
We were told to bring you in.

787
01:12:35,501 --> 01:12:37,628
<i>- Okay.
- Get ready to transport.</i>

788
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,533
Whoa. Hey. Just not right now.

789
01:12:39,638 --> 01:12:42,038
- Just tell them you came and that...
- Ethan. Get in.

790
01:12:42,141 --> 01:12:45,508
We don't want to use force here,
and you know we will. Ethan, get in.

791
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,875
- Tell them that you came here...
- Ethan!

792
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:50,073
...and that I left already, okay?

793
01:12:54,987 --> 01:12:56,181
Freeze!

794
01:12:56,488 --> 01:12:59,616
Ethan, stop! Stop, Ethan!

795
01:13:13,672 --> 01:13:15,469
Yeah. Get his hands.

796
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:46,304
I reviewed the transcript
of your Berlin operation.

797
01:13:46,405 --> 01:13:48,305
It's very interesting.

798
01:13:48,407 --> 01:13:50,466
It seems that Agent Farris
had some information

799
01:13:50,576 --> 01:13:53,807
she wished to share with you
but not with this agency.

800
01:13:53,912 --> 01:13:55,675
Something you failed to report.

801
01:13:55,781 --> 01:13:58,978
You ordered the Vatican operation
without proper approvals.

802
01:13:59,084 --> 01:14:01,518
That mission
resulted in a catastrophic attack.

803
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,520
And then you fled the scene.

804
01:14:03,622 --> 01:14:06,716
Now, I am not a stranger to disrespect.

805
01:14:07,559 --> 01:14:10,426
You don't get to where I am
without developing a thick skin.

806
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:12,690
But what I won't stand for,

807
01:14:13,065 --> 01:14:16,330
what I will lose sleep over,
and I love my sleep,

808
01:14:16,635 --> 01:14:20,366
is the idea of an irresponsible
rogue agent working in my office.

809
01:14:20,472 --> 01:14:24,238
So I'm going to
slow things way down here.

810
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,347
You can look at me

811
01:14:29,448 --> 01:14:32,611
with those judgmental,
incriminating eyes all you want,

812
01:14:32,751 --> 01:14:34,412
but I bullshit you not.

813
01:14:34,553 --> 01:14:38,353
I will bleed on the flag
to make sure the stripes stay red.

814
01:14:57,409 --> 01:14:59,707
I don't know what to say to you.

815
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:03,643
Brassel's right. You're out of control.

816
01:15:04,983 --> 01:15:06,416
Look at me.

817
01:15:08,186 --> 01:15:12,486
Ethan, at least show me the courtesy
of looking at me when I'm talking to you.

818
01:15:21,133 --> 01:15:25,365
I intercepted Davian's call. I know he
wants the Rabbit's Foot for Julia's life.

819
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:26,937
It's just...

820
01:15:29,341 --> 01:15:30,569
This is

821
01:15:31,376 --> 01:15:33,105
<i>so disappointing.</i>

822
01:15:33,745 --> 01:15:37,181
Go to Shanghai.
Feng Shan Apartments... 1406.

823
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,817
I wish there was something I could do
to help you, but...

824
01:15:51,263 --> 01:15:53,094
Take him to the holding cell.

825
01:17:06,938 --> 01:17:08,371
No, I'm on it.

826
01:17:08,507 --> 01:17:10,600
Yes, sir. There's no need to panic.
I'll get him back.

827
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:11,767
Sir? Ethan Hunt...

828
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,242
I know what happened.
Give me the radio.

829
01:17:13,345 --> 01:17:16,143
This is Director Brassel. Ethan Hunt
is attempting to escape the building.

830
01:17:16,248 --> 01:17:18,239
He's in the west cargo elevator.
He must be stopped.

831
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:21,114
I want Mendoza and Graham
in the situation room right away.

832
01:17:21,219 --> 01:17:22,948
I'm having the building surrounded, sir.

833
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:24,750
I've got units posted
at all the entrances.

834
01:17:24,856 --> 01:17:28,121
<i>This is Brassel again. I'm ordering
a code-six lockdown. I repeat.</i>

835
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:30,524
- It's Hunt.
- I know it's Hunt.

836
01:17:32,297 --> 01:17:35,027
Hunt was flagged
on sub-basement nine.

837
01:17:35,133 --> 01:17:38,432
I want all security personnel
down there now.

838
01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:40,631
Security channel's jammed.

839
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:43,833
Hunt must be holding down
the transmit button.

840
01:18:07,399 --> 01:18:09,196
You've got to be kidding me.

841
01:18:19,911 --> 01:18:24,245
<i>Last call for flight 1162 for Helsinki,
now boarding at gate 46.</i>

842
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:29,981
<i>Final call for Mr. Bower.
Final call for Mr. Bower.</i>

843
01:18:30,088 --> 01:18:31,646
<i>Please come to gate 4.</i>

844
01:18:32,524 --> 01:18:35,425
- Mr. Pavel Sobo... Sobotka.
- Sobotka.

845
01:18:35,527 --> 01:18:38,587
Sobotka. Okay.
And you're flying to Shanghai?

846
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:45,763
I don't speak Czech. I'm sorry.
Let's see about your flight.

847
01:18:45,871 --> 01:18:47,065
Okay.

848
01:18:47,172 --> 01:18:49,003
- Okay.
- Okay.

849
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:28,929
Don't kill me.

850
01:20:30,475 --> 01:20:31,806
I'm sorry.

851
01:20:33,178 --> 01:20:34,543
I'm sorry.

852
01:20:36,281 --> 01:20:39,808
Musgrave told us about Julia.
We're here to help.

853
01:20:39,951 --> 01:20:42,044
To get your wife,
you'll need the Rabbit's Foot.

854
01:20:42,153 --> 01:20:44,178
According to the plans
from Davian's briefcase,

855
01:20:44,289 --> 01:20:47,747
it's in a laboratory on the 56th floor
of the Hengshan Lu Building.

856
01:20:47,859 --> 01:20:49,724
Which is a nightmare
for just about every reason.

857
01:20:49,828 --> 01:20:53,457
They're a Chinese military contractor.
We have no pull, no details.

858
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:55,395
The good news is, whatever it is,

859
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,764
the Rabbit Foot's small,
so we can steal it.

860
01:20:57,869 --> 01:21:00,565
The bad news, we got to steal it.

861
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:04,101
From a thief's point of view,
this is worst-case scenario.

862
01:21:04,209 --> 01:21:06,404
The security guards
are all privately-contracted

863
01:21:06,511 --> 01:21:07,876
former People's Liberation Army.

864
01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:10,243
The only access to the lab
is by private elevator.

865
01:21:10,348 --> 01:21:13,010
And that can only be activated
by persons inside the lab.

866
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,951
All of it surveilled by
security cameras within the building.

867
01:21:16,054 --> 01:21:17,919
What about the roof?

868
01:21:18,857 --> 01:21:21,621
Four guards full time.
Two on each rooftop.

869
01:21:21,726 --> 01:21:23,523
Langley was a cakewalk
compared to this.

870
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:25,152
That's the one.

871
01:21:26,064 --> 01:21:28,032
- How tall is that building?
- Why?

872
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,431
It's 162 meters at the highest point.

873
01:21:30,535 --> 01:21:32,969
What about that, the building
on the left? How tall is that one?

874
01:21:33,071 --> 01:21:34,538
Says 226 meters.

875
01:21:34,673 --> 01:21:37,301
226. Distance between the buildings?

876
01:21:37,409 --> 01:21:39,206
47.55 meters across.

877
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:57,020
Ethan?

878
01:21:57,762 --> 01:22:00,526
That's good. I think it's tall enough.

879
01:22:01,733 --> 01:22:04,167
- For what?
- A fulcrum.

880
01:22:06,271 --> 01:22:08,967
Oh, you're gonna swing...
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

881
01:22:09,074 --> 01:22:11,474
- You could bounce right off the roof.
- Yes, I could.

882
01:22:11,576 --> 01:22:13,703
Even if you made it to the rooftop,
took out the guards,

883
01:22:13,812 --> 01:22:17,441
and got the Rabbit's Foot, you can't just
walk out of the lobby. What's your exit?

884
01:22:17,549 --> 01:22:19,176
Base-jump off the top. I need a chute.

885
01:22:19,284 --> 01:22:21,479
Even at 162, you're pushing
minimum height for a jump.

886
01:22:21,586 --> 01:22:23,144
Chute opens any lower than that
and you're dead.

887
01:22:23,254 --> 01:22:24,312
What are you going to do?

888
01:22:24,422 --> 01:22:26,515
Land in the middle of Shanghai
and hope no one notices?

889
01:22:26,624 --> 01:22:27,886
Central Park's two blocks away.

890
01:22:27,992 --> 01:22:29,892
Wait, wait, Ethan, I'm not saying
I have a better idea,

891
01:22:29,994 --> 01:22:32,462
but there's a point
where bold becomes stupid.

892
01:22:32,564 --> 01:22:35,032
Now, we don't even know
what this thing is, and you're talking

893
01:22:35,133 --> 01:22:38,000
about handing it over to a guy
who provides terrorists with information.

894
01:22:38,103 --> 01:22:40,196
Luther, of course I'm not
suggesting that we just hand it over.

895
01:22:40,305 --> 01:22:43,172
We're going to tag the Rabbit's Foot
so we can trace it and know where it is.

896
01:22:43,274 --> 01:22:46,175
Now, you know we can get
that gear here. I just deliver it myself.

897
01:22:46,277 --> 01:22:49,144
We contact Musgrave,
have the IMF trace a tag, order a raid,

898
01:22:49,247 --> 01:22:51,010
get the Rabbit's Foot back, grab Davian.

899
01:22:51,116 --> 01:22:53,812
Now, if I get out with Julia, we win.

900
01:22:54,953 --> 01:22:56,716
If I don't, then...

901
01:23:03,128 --> 01:23:05,995
Look, then she's dead anyway.
And so am I.

902
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:08,495
You know?

903
01:23:08,633 --> 01:23:12,967
Goddamn it, it's 8:11, it's 8:12.

904
01:23:15,473 --> 01:23:18,601
And we have two hours
before they kill my wife.

905
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:21,240
Are you in or not?

906
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:30,515
Of course we're in.

907
01:24:02,854 --> 01:24:04,617
You got 18 minutes.

908
01:24:07,025 --> 01:24:08,925
You're going to make it over there.

909
01:24:09,027 --> 01:24:12,360
You're going to find the Rabbit's Foot,
get back to the roof,

910
01:24:12,497 --> 01:24:14,294
radio me when you're ready to make
the jump,

911
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:16,833
and we're going to come get you.

912
01:24:17,836 --> 01:24:19,565
Thank you for coming.

913
01:24:20,338 --> 01:24:21,805
That's my job.

914
01:24:58,109 --> 01:24:59,440
Batter up.

915
01:25:27,238 --> 01:25:30,264
Oh, yeah. They're freaking out.
Hit them again.

916
01:27:05,169 --> 01:27:06,295
Okay.

917
01:27:07,839 --> 01:27:08,828
<i>He made it.</i>

918
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,405
He made it.

919
01:27:13,544 --> 01:27:15,307
I knew he'd make it.

920
01:27:29,861 --> 01:27:32,762
I'm going in. I'll be out in five minutes.

921
01:27:40,938 --> 01:27:43,338
- It's been 12 minutes.
- He's got five minutes left.

922
01:27:43,441 --> 01:27:46,877
If he doesn't call Davian in five minutes,
Julia's dead.

923
01:27:46,978 --> 01:27:48,343
<i>Anything?</i>

924
01:27:49,914 --> 01:27:50,903
Negative.

925
01:27:51,049 --> 01:27:53,176
<i>How about you? Any good news?</i>

926
01:27:53,284 --> 01:27:54,717
No, nothing.

927
01:27:54,886 --> 01:27:56,376
Come on, Ethan.

928
01:28:05,663 --> 01:28:07,130
What is that?

929
01:28:12,303 --> 01:28:16,603
When I was little I had a cat,
and he used to run away all the time.

930
01:28:18,109 --> 01:28:21,237
And it's just a prayer I'd say
to bring him home.

931
01:28:23,181 --> 01:28:24,705
Teach it to me.

932
01:28:26,484 --> 01:28:28,679
<i>I've got the Rabbit's Foot,
but I can't make it to the roof.</i>

933
01:28:28,786 --> 01:28:31,584
What the hell do you mean you can't
make it to the roof? Where are you?

934
01:28:31,689 --> 01:28:33,748
<i>Look up! Look up, look up!</i>

935
01:28:36,627 --> 01:28:38,788
- Oh, shit.
- He's way too low.

936
01:30:29,574 --> 01:30:32,566
- Ethan! Get in! They're coming!
- Who?

937
01:30:32,710 --> 01:30:35,338
Building security, and they're pissed.

938
01:30:37,949 --> 01:30:39,780
Okay. Go, go, go, go.

939
01:30:46,657 --> 01:30:48,750
How much time you got left?

940
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:50,857
Less than two minutes.

941
01:30:57,168 --> 01:31:00,296
You gotta get us out of here.
I lost the signal.

942
01:31:03,007 --> 01:31:04,770
- You okay?
- Not yet.

943
01:31:13,150 --> 01:31:14,276
Come on. Come on.

944
01:31:21,692 --> 01:31:23,319
I don't have a signal.
I don't have a signal.

945
01:31:23,427 --> 01:31:24,621
I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it!

946
01:31:33,104 --> 01:31:34,162
Zhen!

947
01:31:36,307 --> 01:31:37,934
Damn it. I'm sorry.

948
01:31:46,183 --> 01:31:47,844
Put pressure on it.

949
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:51,480
- Tell me when you get a signal.
- What are you doing?

950
01:32:10,574 --> 01:32:12,132
I got a signal!

951
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:17,777
Hit redial.

952
01:32:19,917 --> 01:32:22,613
<i>You only had five seconds left.
Do you realize that?</i>

953
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:25,018
The Rabbit's Foot. I have it.

954
01:32:25,389 --> 01:32:29,382
<i>The train yard at Dunan Zhong Lu.
Wait for me there. Alone.</i>

955
01:32:32,697 --> 01:32:34,164
<i>- Yeah?
- Go secure.</i>

956
01:32:34,265 --> 01:32:35,493
We are.

957
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,625
<i>I have the Rabbit's Foot.</i>

958
01:32:38,736 --> 01:32:40,966
- You okay?
- I'm tagging it now.

959
01:32:43,941 --> 01:32:46,307
You need to run a trace.
Make sure we have eyes on this thing.

960
01:32:46,410 --> 01:32:49,379
- What's the tag?
- 6-3-9-6-4-1.

961
01:32:50,348 --> 01:32:51,508
Got it.

962
01:32:54,251 --> 01:32:55,582
I see you on Luang Tao Lu Road.

963
01:32:55,686 --> 01:32:59,178
If you don't hear from me in eight hours,
you send an army after this thing.

964
01:32:59,290 --> 01:33:01,155
- Good luck.
- You, too.

965
01:33:08,566 --> 01:33:10,363
<i>- Mr. Musgrave.
- Yeah.</i>

966
01:33:10,601 --> 01:33:12,660
<i>It's come to my attention
that yesterday afternoon</i>

967
01:33:12,770 --> 01:33:14,260
<i>you sent a team to the Far East.</i>

968
01:33:14,905 --> 01:33:16,964
We received intel that
Hadaam Saleen Bahar

969
01:33:17,074 --> 01:33:18,336
was en route to Shanghai.

970
01:33:18,442 --> 01:33:20,740
- Hadaam Saleen Bahar.
- That's right.

971
01:33:20,878 --> 01:33:22,812
You know what I'd love?
I'd love to see that intel.

972
01:33:22,913 --> 01:33:25,383
- I'll be in my office.
- Yes, sir.

973
01:33:37,895 --> 01:33:39,385
Thanks again.

974
01:33:39,797 --> 01:33:41,765
I'll see you back home.

975
01:33:42,666 --> 01:33:43,894
Ethan.

976
01:33:45,102 --> 01:33:48,071
You know they probably plan
to kill you both.

977
01:33:49,774 --> 01:33:52,072
Then I won't see you back home.

978
01:33:53,644 --> 01:33:55,202
Better get back.

979
01:34:42,193 --> 01:34:44,593
Drink it. No questions.

980
01:35:48,192 --> 01:35:49,557
Good morning.

981
01:36:05,476 --> 01:36:06,602
Jules.

982
01:36:07,811 --> 01:36:10,678
We've put an explosive charge
in your head.

983
01:36:10,781 --> 01:36:12,840
Does that sound familiar?

984
01:36:13,584 --> 01:36:15,882
The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?

985
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:18,281
I gave it to you.

986
01:36:18,889 --> 01:36:21,084
Now, I'm going to count to 10

987
01:36:21,225 --> 01:36:24,854
and you're going to tell me
where the Rabbit's Foot is

988
01:36:26,263 --> 01:36:27,628
or she dies.

989
01:36:52,823 --> 01:36:56,156
Seems we have a lot to talk about.
Don't we?

990
01:36:58,996 --> 01:37:00,930
- Do you think I'm playing?
- Son of a bitch!

991
01:37:01,031 --> 01:37:03,761
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?

992
01:37:03,867 --> 01:37:04,925
Where is it?

993
01:37:05,035 --> 01:37:06,400
- Look at me.
- Where the hell is it?

994
01:37:06,503 --> 01:37:07,765
- Look at me. Stay with me.
- Seven!

995
01:37:07,871 --> 01:37:10,101
I am going to kill you.
I swear to God I'm going to...

996
01:37:10,207 --> 01:37:12,072
- Eight!
- No, please.

997
01:37:13,877 --> 01:37:17,404
Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.

998
01:37:18,015 --> 01:37:21,007
I promise you. I promise you.

999
01:37:21,385 --> 01:37:24,081
- I can figure out how to get whatever...
- Nine.

1000
01:37:25,122 --> 01:37:28,057
Listen to me. I want to help you get
whatever you want.

1001
01:37:28,158 --> 01:37:31,685
But you got to do what's right.
What you know is right.

1002
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:34,097
No, please...

1003
01:37:36,734 --> 01:37:37,792
No.

1004
01:37:40,037 --> 01:37:41,026
No.

1005
01:37:41,405 --> 01:37:43,134
- Ten.
- Don't!

1006
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:03,619
I pushed him as far as he can go.
I know he's not lying.

1007
01:38:03,927 --> 01:38:05,451
I understand.

1008
01:38:06,063 --> 01:38:09,226
I've got some questions
I want to ask him first.

1009
01:38:31,689 --> 01:38:33,316
It's complicated.

1010
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:42,425
You can't just open the canister.

1011
01:38:42,566 --> 01:38:45,399
We had to make sure
you brought the real thing.

1012
01:38:45,536 --> 01:38:48,835
The Rabbit's Foot. Now we know.

1013
01:38:57,614 --> 01:39:00,845
Don't you touch her!
Don't you touch her!

1014
01:39:10,094 --> 01:39:13,530
Davian's translator,
his Head of Security.

1015
01:39:14,832 --> 01:39:17,960
Remember?
At the Vatican she failed him.

1016
01:39:20,337 --> 01:39:24,535
Ethan, Julia is still alive.

1017
01:39:25,342 --> 01:39:29,210
Davian wanted to kill you both,
but I convinced him otherwise.

1018
01:39:29,313 --> 01:39:33,147
Julia hasn't seen me.
She doesn't know anything. She's clean.

1019
01:39:33,317 --> 01:39:35,615
She can go on to have a life.

1020
01:39:36,019 --> 01:39:40,581
As long as you tell me,
what was in Lindsey's message?

1021
01:39:41,592 --> 01:39:44,425
I know she sent you a microdot
from Berlin.

1022
01:39:45,829 --> 01:39:48,297
Did Lindsey know
about me and Davian?

1023
01:39:48,432 --> 01:39:51,367
Is that why she sent the message
to you? Did you read it?

1024
01:39:51,468 --> 01:39:53,095
Did anyone else see it?

1025
01:39:53,203 --> 01:39:55,501
Did she know about the work
I was doing?

1026
01:39:55,606 --> 01:39:57,574
Could I be compromised at IMF?

1027
01:39:57,674 --> 01:39:59,301
Ethan. Ethan.

1028
01:40:00,778 --> 01:40:03,110
Did she buy that Brassel set her up?

1029
01:40:03,213 --> 01:40:04,942
Did she buy that?

1030
01:40:06,216 --> 01:40:07,649
You told him.

1031
01:40:09,019 --> 01:40:11,487
That's how Davian knew
Lindsey was coming.

1032
01:40:11,622 --> 01:40:13,180
You told him.

1033
01:40:15,159 --> 01:40:17,423
I thought you could get her back.

1034
01:40:17,528 --> 01:40:21,123
But I wasn't gonna let Brassel,
of all people, undo the work I'd done.

1035
01:40:21,231 --> 01:40:25,668
I took action, Ethan, on behalf
of the working families of our country.

1036
01:40:25,803 --> 01:40:27,202
The Armed Forces, the White House.

1037
01:40:27,304 --> 01:40:29,238
I'd had enough
of Brassel and his sanctimony.

1038
01:40:29,339 --> 01:40:32,638
IMF Executive Director.
He's an affirmative action poster boy.

1039
01:40:32,743 --> 01:40:36,201
You grab Davian like he wanted,
then what?

1040
01:40:36,814 --> 01:40:38,441
Davian's a weed.

1041
01:40:40,150 --> 01:40:44,177
You cut him out, two more spring up
just like him the next day.

1042
01:40:44,388 --> 01:40:46,288
Arrest him? Then what?

1043
01:40:47,724 --> 01:40:49,123
You use him.

1044
01:40:50,594 --> 01:40:53,222
Collaborate with him.

1045
01:40:54,731 --> 01:40:56,722
And it's Christmas.

1046
01:40:58,569 --> 01:41:01,504
In 18 hours,
the Rabbit's Foot will be delivered

1047
01:41:01,605 --> 01:41:04,904
to its Middle Eastern buyer,
and we'll have credible intel to prove it.

1048
01:41:05,008 --> 01:41:07,841
US Security Council will get a report
by this time tomorrow.

1049
01:41:07,945 --> 01:41:11,005
We're talking a military strike
within a week.

1050
01:41:11,415 --> 01:41:13,474
And when the sand settles,

1051
01:41:13,951 --> 01:41:16,419
our country will do what it does best.

1052
01:41:16,553 --> 01:41:19,215
Clean up. Infrastructure.

1053
01:41:20,958 --> 01:41:22,550
Democracy wins.

1054
01:41:26,930 --> 01:41:29,763
What was Lindsey's message?

1055
01:41:30,801 --> 01:41:34,100
You tell me, and Julia walks.

1056
01:41:36,707 --> 01:41:39,175
It's the only play you have left.

1057
01:41:40,544 --> 01:41:43,911
Not till I hear her voice,
know she's alive.

1058
01:41:46,083 --> 01:41:47,380
Of course.

1059
01:42:00,497 --> 01:42:01,862
Put her on.

1060
01:42:09,473 --> 01:42:11,108
<i>- Jules?
- Ethan?</i>

1061
01:42:11,108 --> 01:42:11,597
<i>- Jules?
- Ethan?</i>

1062
01:42:11,909 --> 01:42:15,140
When we met,
there was a lake near the mountain.

1063
01:42:17,347 --> 01:42:19,315
What was the lake called?

1064
01:42:20,651 --> 01:42:21,879
<i>Wanaka.</i>

1065
01:42:22,486 --> 01:42:24,044
<i>Please, Ethan.</i>

1066
01:42:24,254 --> 01:42:26,779
<i>- Jules.
- Ethan, I don't understand...</i>

1067
01:42:46,176 --> 01:42:47,666
Benjamin Dunne.

1068
01:42:48,445 --> 01:42:49,503
Benji, it's me.

1069
01:42:49,613 --> 01:42:52,639
<i>- Ethan.
- What? No. Really?</i>

1070
01:42:52,783 --> 01:42:54,444
<i>Listen to me very carefully.
I need your help.</i>

1071
01:42:56,153 --> 01:42:59,384
I need to trace the location
of the last call made from this phone.

1072
01:42:59,489 --> 01:43:01,116
Look, no. Ethan. Shush.

1073
01:43:01,224 --> 01:43:02,953
<i>They're looking...
Everyone's looking for you.</i>

1074
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:06,120
<i>Everyone I know. They're looking...
I just looked it up.</i>

1075
01:43:06,229 --> 01:43:08,060
<i>Okay, you're on
Interpol's most wanted list.</i>

1076
01:43:08,165 --> 01:43:10,633
And that, by the way,
is a spectacular list to be on.

1077
01:43:10,734 --> 01:43:13,202
<i>Whatever happened, I'm sorry,
but I'm hanging up now right now.</i>

1078
01:43:13,303 --> 01:43:14,531
Benji, I don't have time for this.

1079
01:43:14,638 --> 01:43:16,265
What do you think happened?
I've been set up.

1080
01:43:16,373 --> 01:43:19,433
I think I like my job. Okay? A lot.

1081
01:43:19,543 --> 01:43:21,374
All right? And you know
they're gonna be taping this call.

1082
01:43:21,712 --> 01:43:24,442
And you know you can erase it.
I'm giving you the number right now.

1083
01:43:24,548 --> 01:43:26,641
- Are you ready?
- All right. Just hang on.

1084
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:29,116
I'm gonna lose my citizenship
because of this, you know.

1085
01:43:29,219 --> 01:43:32,052
7-3-4-4-2-5-6-4-3-6-7.

1086
01:43:32,189 --> 01:43:34,953
Okay. Wait. Okay. Hold the line, please.

1087
01:43:49,272 --> 01:43:50,864
- Are you there?
- Yeah.

1088
01:43:51,008 --> 01:43:52,202
<i>Okay.</i>

1089
01:43:52,909 --> 01:43:56,037
<i>Maybe we can share a jail cell together,
you know?</i>

1090
01:43:56,179 --> 01:43:58,704
If this all goes tits up, which it will.

1091
01:43:58,849 --> 01:44:00,646
The location of that number
is Shanghai.

1092
01:44:00,751 --> 01:44:02,013
There, I just told you. Shanghai.

1093
01:44:02,119 --> 01:44:04,747
I've just aided and abetted an enemy
of the state. Fantastic. Thank you.

1094
01:44:04,855 --> 01:44:07,153
Am I close?
Use this phone to track my location.

1095
01:44:07,257 --> 01:44:09,657
Oh, you're there. Well, you're close.

1096
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,523
How close?
Is the signal in the building?

1097
01:44:11,628 --> 01:44:13,095
No, no, no. It isn't coming from there.

1098
01:44:13,196 --> 01:44:14,993
It's in a building
one mile to the northeast.

1099
01:44:15,098 --> 01:44:16,690
<i>Benji, lead me to the signal.</i>

1100
01:44:29,246 --> 01:44:32,738
<i>There is one thing. What the hell
are you doing in Shanghai?</i>

1101
01:44:32,883 --> 01:44:35,044
I'll tell you when I see you.

1102
01:44:43,593 --> 01:44:45,857
What you...
You need to go north.

1103
01:44:45,962 --> 01:44:48,328
Okay, there's a bridge.
Get to it, cross it.

1104
01:44:48,432 --> 01:44:51,765
<i>Make a left. Go three-quarters of a mile
along the river.</i>

1105
01:44:51,902 --> 01:44:53,699
I got it. I got it.

1106
01:45:29,106 --> 01:45:31,040
Good, good. That's right.
Keep going. Keep going.

1107
01:45:31,141 --> 01:45:32,540
Make your next left
and then the next one.

1108
01:45:32,642 --> 01:45:34,234
And then follow that down 1,000 yards.

1109
01:45:34,344 --> 01:45:36,005
A thousand yards.

1110
01:45:36,379 --> 01:45:39,280
<i>- Okay. Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay. Left. Left.</i>

1111
01:45:39,850 --> 01:45:41,943
Yeah, that's good. That's good.
Keep going. Keep going.

1112
01:45:42,052 --> 01:45:44,179
Okay, now look... Hiya. Hi.

1113
01:45:44,321 --> 01:45:45,788
<i>Benji, where?</i>

1114
01:45:45,889 --> 01:45:48,153
<i>- Benji? Which way do I go?
- Now take a right.</i>

1115
01:45:54,898 --> 01:45:56,365
Okay. Go down, left.

1116
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:58,631
Left? I'm going left.

1117
01:46:00,537 --> 01:46:01,629
<i>Good, good.</i>

1118
01:46:01,738 --> 01:46:03,467
It's in the second building on your left.

1119
01:46:03,573 --> 01:46:05,939
The signal bearing's
plus or minus three meters

1120
01:46:06,042 --> 01:46:07,168
from the northeast corner.

1121
01:46:07,711 --> 01:46:08,973
I owe you.

1122
01:48:06,263 --> 01:48:08,163
Jules. Jules.

1123
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:10,459
You're gonna be okay.

1124
01:48:13,503 --> 01:48:14,765
Oh, God!

1125
01:48:15,305 --> 01:48:16,329
God!

1126
01:48:27,017 --> 01:48:29,451
I've activated the charge in your head.

1127
01:48:34,958 --> 01:48:37,426
You have maybe four minutes left.

1128
01:48:46,903 --> 01:48:49,599
Didn't I tell you
she'd call out your name?

1129
01:48:55,712 --> 01:48:58,681
Ethan. Ethan.

1130
01:49:02,819 --> 01:49:03,877
No.

1131
01:49:08,758 --> 01:49:10,055
Please.

1132
01:49:14,898 --> 01:49:18,231
And I told you I was going to kill you
in front of her?

1133
01:49:18,368 --> 01:49:20,893
Well, I'm going to kill her in front of you.

1134
01:51:13,450 --> 01:51:14,576
Ethan?

1135
01:51:17,887 --> 01:51:19,354
Are you okay?

1136
01:51:20,457 --> 01:51:22,186
I don't understand
what's going on, Ethan.

1137
01:51:22,292 --> 01:51:25,227
- I know. I know. Just wait.
- What do those men want from you?

1138
01:51:25,328 --> 01:51:27,956
Why are we here?
How did you find me?

1139
01:51:29,065 --> 01:51:31,863
Please, Ethan.
What the hell is going on?

1140
01:51:32,035 --> 01:51:33,332
Are you okay?

1141
01:51:33,470 --> 01:51:37,167
Ethan, what's wrong? Okay. Oh, God.

1142
01:51:40,310 --> 01:51:44,178
I'm going to tell you everything.
You just stay with me.

1143
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:53,721
Ethan. What's happening?
What are you looking for?

1144
01:51:53,857 --> 01:51:56,553
- We've got to get out of here.
- Not yet.

1145
01:51:58,361 --> 01:52:00,056
- They don't have one!
- What?

1146
01:52:00,163 --> 01:52:02,563
- A defibrillator.
- A defibrillator?

1147
01:52:02,699 --> 01:52:03,791
Ethan?

1148
01:52:04,567 --> 01:52:08,503
Ethan? Who are these people?
What the hell are we doing here?

1149
01:52:11,407 --> 01:52:12,635
Good!

1150
01:52:14,077 --> 01:52:16,170
This is a Beretta 92F.

1151
01:52:17,013 --> 01:52:18,810
It's a very accurate,
close-range weapon.

1152
01:52:18,915 --> 01:52:21,145
- Don't point it at me.
- Sorry.

1153
01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:24,518
It holds 15 rounds.

1154
01:52:24,621 --> 01:52:27,988
When the mag is empty,
the slide will lock back like this.

1155
01:52:28,091 --> 01:52:30,321
How do you know so much about this?

1156
01:52:30,426 --> 01:52:33,020
To reload, push this button.

1157
01:52:33,463 --> 01:52:35,021
The empty mag falls out

1158
01:52:35,131 --> 01:52:37,065
and you shove the other one in,

1159
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:39,668
like the batteries in the flashlight
in the kitchen,

1160
01:52:39,769 --> 01:52:41,703
then release the slide.

1161
01:52:44,908 --> 01:52:46,933
- Why are you giving me a gun?
- There could be others.

1162
01:52:47,043 --> 01:52:48,806
If you have to use it, you stay low.

1163
01:52:48,912 --> 01:52:51,608
You identify your enemy.
Point and shoot.

1164
01:52:51,748 --> 01:52:53,306
It's very simple. Point and shoot.

1165
01:52:53,416 --> 01:52:54,781
Stand back.

1166
01:52:56,553 --> 01:52:57,611
Good.

1167
01:52:58,955 --> 01:53:01,685
I have a charge in my head.
I'm going to die unless you kill me.

1168
01:53:01,791 --> 01:53:03,782
- What?
- Throw the switch on and off.

1169
01:53:03,893 --> 01:53:05,326
- Don't forget the off.
- I can't do that.

1170
01:53:05,428 --> 01:53:07,658
You can bring me back.
I'll come back.

1171
01:53:07,764 --> 01:53:09,994
- I can't.
- You have to! There's no time!

1172
01:53:10,099 --> 01:53:11,566
Now! Please!

1173
01:53:18,441 --> 01:53:20,966
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait. I love you.

1174
01:53:21,277 --> 01:53:22,608
I love you.

1175
01:54:37,754 --> 01:54:38,982
Oh, God.

1176
01:54:45,161 --> 01:54:46,628
Come on, baby.

1177
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,401
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight,

1178
01:54:54,537 --> 01:54:58,132
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen.

1179
01:55:03,246 --> 01:55:07,740
Come on, baby.
I need you to come back.

1180
01:55:09,185 --> 01:55:10,743
I need you back.

1181
01:55:56,999 --> 01:55:58,296
Oh, God.

1182
01:56:07,577 --> 01:56:08,976
You did that?

1183
01:56:12,849 --> 01:56:13,941
Wow.

1184
01:56:40,843 --> 01:56:42,936
So, I was just thinking...

1185
01:56:45,381 --> 01:56:49,317
I was thinking you might want to tell me
why we're in China.

1186
01:56:50,853 --> 01:56:52,081
I know.

1187
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:57,250
I...

1188
01:56:59,061 --> 01:57:00,926
I work for an agency.

1189
01:57:01,998 --> 01:57:03,590
It's called IMF.

1190
01:57:06,335 --> 01:57:08,303
What does that stand for?

1191
01:57:09,539 --> 01:57:11,598
Impossible Mission Force.

1192
01:57:12,575 --> 01:57:13,769
Shut up.

1193
01:57:14,677 --> 01:57:16,042
No, I'm not kidding.

1194
01:57:16,145 --> 01:57:20,013
You don't understand.
Everything I'm telling you is top-secret.

1195
01:57:20,149 --> 01:57:21,844
You can trust me.

1196
01:57:22,351 --> 01:57:23,613
Yeah, I know.

1197
01:57:25,021 --> 01:57:27,581
<i>Just wanna show my appreciation
for your work.</i>

1198
01:57:35,064 --> 01:57:38,966
Call it reparations for anything
I might have put you through.

1199
01:57:39,368 --> 01:57:41,461
You should know
the White House has contacted me.

1200
01:57:41,571 --> 01:57:43,903
Now, there's a job that they are

1201
01:57:44,574 --> 01:57:47,168
very interested
in speaking with you about.

1202
01:57:50,613 --> 01:57:53,047
Thank you,

1203
01:57:54,116 --> 01:57:55,276
but I have a lot to think about.

1204
01:57:55,384 --> 01:57:58,410
You aren't considering quitting,
are you, Ethan?

1205
01:57:58,554 --> 01:58:01,148
I'm considering
going on my honeymoon.

1206
01:58:04,126 --> 01:58:05,286
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

1207
01:58:05,394 --> 01:58:06,486
Yeah.

1208
01:58:08,297 --> 01:58:09,855
Hey, one thing.

1209
01:58:11,434 --> 01:58:13,698
The Rabbit's Foot. What is it?

1210
01:58:17,139 --> 01:58:19,937
Promise me you'll stay, I'll tell you.

1211
01:58:22,578 --> 01:58:25,376
- I'll send you a postcard.
- Fair enough.
