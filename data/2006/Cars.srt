[Male] OK... Here we go. Focus.

3
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:43,710
Speed. I am speed.

[Cars whizzing past]

5
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,131
One winner, 42 losers.

6
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,759
I eat losers for breakfast.

7
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,803
[Car accelerating]

8
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,304
Breakfast.

9
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,473
Wait, maybe I
should have had breakfast.

10
00:00:56,557 --> 00:01:00,269
A little breck-y could be good for me.
No, no, no, stay focused. Speed.

00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,895
[Cars whizzing]

12
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,189
I'm faster than fast.
Quicker than quick.

13
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:05,858
I am lightning!

14
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,900
[Pounding on door]

15
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,278

[# Sheryl Crow: Real Gone]

17
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:14,116
Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready

Get your antenna balls here!

27
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,380
Go, Lightnin'!

28
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:55,467

- [Male] Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.
- [Crowd cheers]

33
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm Bob Cutlass, here
with my good friend, Darrell Cartrip.

34
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,086
We're midway through what may
be an historic day for racing.

35
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:33,172
Bob, my oil pressure's
through the roof

36
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:36,842
If this gets more exciting, they're
gonna have to tow me outta the booth!

37
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:37,968
Right, Darrell.

38
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,679
[Bob] Three cars are tied
for the season points lead,

39
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,848
heading into the final race
of the season.

40
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:47,686
And the winner of this race will win
the season title and the Piston Cup.

41
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,438
Does The King, Strip Weathers,

42
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,940
have one more victory in him
before retirement?

43
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,610
[Darrell] He's been Dinoco's golden boy
for years!

44
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,862
Can he win them one last Piston Cup?

45
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,324
[Bob] And, as always, in the
second place spot we find Chick Hicks.

46
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,910
He's been chasing
that tailfin his entire career.

47
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,120
[Darrell] Chick thought
this was his year.

48
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,956
His chance to finally emerge
from The King's shadow.

49
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,127
But the last thing he expected was...
Lightning McQueen!

50
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,796
[Bob] You know, I don't think
anybody expected this.

51
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,508
The rookie sensation
came into the season unknown.

52
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,092
But everyone knows him now.

53
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:23,222
[Darrell] Will he be the first rookie
to win a Piston Cup and land Dinoco?

54
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,891
[Bob] The legend, the runner-up,
and the rookie!

55
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,852
Three cars, one champion!

56
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,815

[Chuckling]

62
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,675
Go get 'em, McQueen!
Go get 'em!

63
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,347
[Female] I love you, Lightning!

64
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,058
- Dinoco is all mine.
- [Screaming]

65
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,060
[Darrell] Trouble, turn three!

66
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,355
- Get through that, McQueen.
- [Bob] Huge crash behind the leaders!

[Both screaming]

72
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,130
[Bob] Wait a second, Darrell.
McQueen is in the wreckage.

73
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,049
[Darrell] There's no way the rookie
can make it through!

74
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,342
Not in one piece, that is.

75
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,021
[Exhaling]

76
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,650
Yeah!

77
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,694
Lightning! Oh!

78
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:05,073
[Darrell] Look at that!
McQueen made it through!

79
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,618
[Bob] A spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

80
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,786
Yeah! Ka-chow!

81
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,123
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen! McQueen!

82
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:16,168
Yeah, McQueen! Ka-chow! [honking]

83
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,462
[Bob] While everyone
heads into the pits,

84
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,297
McQueen stays out to take the lead!

85
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,383
Don't take me out, coach.
I can still race!

86
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,178
[Air wrench whirring]

87
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,599
[Chuckling] What do you think?
A thing of beauty.

88
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,601
- McQueen made it!
- [Chick] What?

89
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:33,727
He's not pitting!

90
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,939
You gotta get me out there!
Let's go! Get me back out there!

91
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,774
McQueen's not going into the pits!

92
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,402
[Darrell] The rookie fired his
crew chief. The third this season!

93
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,780
- [Bob] Says he likes working alone.
- Go, go!

94
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,074
Looks like Chick
got caught up in the pits.

95
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,536
Yeah, after a stop like that,
he's got a lot of ground to make up.

96
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,996
Get ready, boys,
we're coming to the restart!

97
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,794
[Crowd cheers]

98
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,975
Come on, come on, come on!

99
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,485
We need tires now!
Come on, let's go!

100
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,238
- No, no, no, no! No tires, just gas!
- [Male] What?

101
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,448
You need tires, you idiot!

102
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,743
[Darrell] Looks like it's
gas-and-go's for McQueen today.

103
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,245
[Bob] Right. No tires again.

104
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,998
[Darrell] That's a short-term gain,
long-term loss,

105
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,751
but it's workin' for him. He obviously
knows somethin' we don't know.

106
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,383
[Cars whizzing]

107
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:52,097
[Bob] This is it, Darrell. One lap to go
and Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

108
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:55,058
He's got it in the bag.
Call in the dogs and put out the fire!

109
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,394
We're gonna crown us a new champion!

110
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,688

111
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,982

- Checkered flag, here I come!
- [Tire blows]

113
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,197
[Darrell] No! McQueen's blown a tire!

114
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,991
[Bob] And with only one turn to go!
Can he make it?

115
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,619
- You fool!
- [Grunts]

116
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,456
[Male] McQueen's blown a tire!
He's blown a tire!

117
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,041
Go, go, go!

118
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,133
- [Grunting]
- [Tire blows]

119
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,927
[Darrell] He's lost another tire!

120
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,222
- King and Chick come up fast!
- [Bob] They're entering turn three!

121
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,182
Come on. [grunting]

122
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,269
I don't believe
what I'm watching, Bob!

123
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:42,898
Lightning McQueen
is 100 feet from his Piston Cup!

124
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,234
[Gasping]

125
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:47,986
[Growling]

126
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:51,240
[Bob] The King and Chick
rounding turn four.

127
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,371
[Darrell] Down the stretch they come!
And it's, and it's...

128
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,249
- It's too close to call! Too close!
- I don't believe it!

129
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,667
Lightning!

130
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,962
- The most spectacular, amazing...
- I don't believe it!

131
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,507
...unequivocally, unbelievable ending
in the history of the world!

132
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,592
- And we don't know who won!
- Look at that!

133
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,887
[Tape jittering]

134
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,934
[Slow motion drone]

135
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,314
- That's very close to call.
- Can we play that again?

136
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,608
Hey, no cameras! Get outta here!

137
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:26,733
We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.

138
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,194
We're here in Victory Lane,
awaiting the results.

139
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,738
McQueen, that was a risky move,
not taking tires.

140
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:32,781
Tell me about it!

141
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:35,534
Are you sorry you didn't have
a crew chief out there?

142
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:39,037
Oh, Kori. There's a lot more to racing
than just winning.

143
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:43,000
I mean, taking the race by a full lap...
Where's the entertainment in that?

144
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,002
I wanted to give folks a little sizzle.

145
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,212
- Sizzle?
- Am I sorry I don't have a crew chief?

146
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:49,464
No, I'm not.
'Cause I'm a one-man show.

147
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,966
What? Oh, yeah, right.

148
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,093
That was a confident
Lightning McQueen.

149
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:55,804
Live from Victory Lane,
I'm Kori Turbowitz.

150
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,556
- Get outta the shot.
- Yo, Chuck.

151
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,308
Chuck, what are you doing?
You're blockin' the camera!

152
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,393
- Everyone wants to see the bolt.
- What?

153
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:05,063
- Now, back away.
- That's it! Come on, guys.

154
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:09,193
- Whoa, team! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One-Man Show!

155
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,986
Oh, OK, leave. Fine.

156
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:14,823
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

157
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:15,866
[Crowd laughs]

158
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,869
- Adios, Chuck!
- And my name is not Chuck!

159
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,579
Oh, whatever.

160
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,664
Hey, Lightning! Yo! McQueen!

161
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:26,043
Seriously, that was some
pretty darn nice racin' out there.

162
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,337
- By me!
- Oh, yeah.

163
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,964
- Zinger!
- Welcome to the Chick era, baby!

164
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,675
The Piston Cup...
It's mine, dude. It's mine.

165
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,347
Hey, fellas, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue? Dinoco blue!

166
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,224
In your dreams, Thunder.

167
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,393
Yeah, right. Thunder?
What's he talkin' about, "Thunder"?

168
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:46,313
You know, 'cause thunder
always comes after lightning.

169
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,190
Ka-ping! Ka-pow!

170
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:50,692
- Who knew about the thunder thing?

about talkin' to the accused?

449
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:24,014
Well, quit your yappin' and tow this

460
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:50,499
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's got a timeshare there.

461
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:55,671

470
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:19,361
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots!
No, check that.

471
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:23,198
I'm gonna put him in jail till
the jail rots on top of him,

472
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,910
and then I'm gonna move him
to a new jail and let that jail rot.

I'm...

474
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,416
Throw him out of here, Sheriff.

475
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:35,878
I want him out of my courtroom.
I want him out of our town!

476
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:37,588
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

477
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,923

Holy Porsche! She's gotta be
from my attorney's office.

480
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:49,057
Hey, thanks for comin',
but we're all set.

481
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,560
- He's letting me go.
- He's letting you go?

482
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:53,562
Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

483
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:56,773

and let me look at you.

- Please!
- I know. I get that reaction a lot.

487
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:09,244

they themselves don't understand.

- Agh! Ow!

489
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:13,457
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I scare you?

490
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,542
A little bit, but I'll be all right.

491
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:19,421
OK. I'm gonna go talk to the judge.

492
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:22,090
Do what you gotta do, baby.
But listen. Be careful.

493
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:25,844
Folks around here are not firing on
all cylinders, if you know what I mean.

495

Ah!

496
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:31,141
I'll keep that in mind.

497
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:33,727
- Hey there, Mater.
- Howdy, Sally.

498
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:36,396
- Hi, folks!
- Good morning!

499
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:38,106
You know her?

500
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,151
She's the town attorney and my fiancée.

501
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:42,236
What?

502
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,406
Nah, I'm just kiddin'.
She just likes me for my body.

503
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:50,285
You look great. You do something
different with your side view mirrors?

504
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:52,037
What do you want, Sally?

505
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,457
[Sighing] Come on, make this guy
fix the road. The town needs this.

506
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:58,710
No. I know his type. Racecar.

507
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:00,838
That's the last thing this town needs.

508
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:05,425
OK, I didn't want to have to do this,
Doc, but you leave me no choice.

509
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:09,429
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

510
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:10,931
Here she goes again.

511
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:13,684
Radiator Springs,
the glorious jewel

512
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:17,396
strung on the necklace
of Route 66, the mother road!

513
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:21,275
It is our job and our pleasure
to take care of the travelers

514
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:24,319
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers? What travelers?

515
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:25,571
Ignore him.

516
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:28,991
But how, I ask you,
are we to care for those travelers

517
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:31,410
if there is no road
for them to drive on?

518
00:32:31,493 --> 00:32:34,288
- Luigi, what do you have at your store?
- Tires.

519
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:35,831
And if no one can get to you?

520
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:40,252
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!

521
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:43,172
- Flo, what do you have at your store?
- I have gas.

522
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:46,633
- Lotsa gas!
- OK boys, stay with me.

523
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:50,220
And, Flo, what'll happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

524
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:53,807
I'll go outta business and...
we'll have to leave town.

525
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:57,019
What's gonna happen if Flo
leaves town and closes her station?

526
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,646
- [All] Without gas, we're done for!
- What?

527
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,524
Don't you think the car responsible
should fix our road?

528
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:05,861
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

529
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:08,155
Lizzie, Big Al left like, 15 years ago.

530
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:10,240
Then why are you bringing
him up, you lemon?

531
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:11,325
Oh, he can do it.

532
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:14,203
He's got the horsepower.
So, what do you want him to do?

533
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:15,746
[All] Fix the road!

534
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:19,374
- Because we are a town worth fixing!
- Yeah!

535
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:20,709
[All cheer]

536
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:23,962
[Honking] Order in the court!

537
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:27,508
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

538
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:29,551
- [All] Yeah!
- No!

539
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:30,969
[VW van] Nice ruling.

540
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,182
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner.

541
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:39,144
[Chuckling] That's OK, Stickers.
You can take Bessie.

542
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:41,063
Man, you get to work with Bessie!

543
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:43,732
I'd give my left two lug nuts
for somethin' like that.

544
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:46,485
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

545
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:48,237
[Gurgling]

546
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:52,658
This here is Bessie,
finest road-pavin' machine ever built.

547
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:55,786
I'm hereby sentencing you
to community service.

548
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:58,580
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

549
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:00,999
What? This place is crazy!

550
00:34:01,083 --> 00:34:03,252
I know this may be
a bad time right now,

551
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:06,296
but you owe me $32,000
in legal fees.

552
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,381
What?

553
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:11,009
We're gonna hitch you up to Bessie,
and you're gonna pull her nice.

554
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:12,678
You gotta be kidding me.

555
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:15,430
You start there where the road begins.

556
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:18,767
You finish down there
where the road ends.

557
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:23,021
[Mater] Holy shoot!

558
00:34:23,564 --> 00:34:25,941
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How long is this gonna take?

559
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:29,611
Well, fella does it right,
should take him about five days.

560
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:30,821
Five days?

561
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:33,824
But I should be in California
schmoozing Dinoco right now!

562
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:36,869
Then if I were you,
I'd quit yappin' and start workin'!

563
00:34:36,952 --> 00:34:39,413
- Hook him up, Mater.
- Okay-dokey.

564
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:43,625
[Grunting]

565
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:47,171
[Tires squealing, engine rewing]

566
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:49,756
[Lightning] Freedom!

567
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:58,599
Maybe I should've
hooked him up to Bessie...

568
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:02,644
...and then...
then took the boot off.

569
00:35:04,146 --> 00:35:06,523
Whoo-hoo!

570
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:11,278
Goodbye, Radiator Springs,
and goodbye, Bessie!

571
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:15,199
California, here I come! Yeah!

572
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:19,578
Oh, feel that wind.

573
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:21,622
Yes!

574
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:22,706
[Sputtering]

575
00:35:22,789 --> 00:35:24,791
No. No, no, no.

576
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,419
No, no, no, no, no. Outta gas?

577
00:35:27,503 --> 00:35:29,463
How can I be outta gas?

578
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:33,509
[Chuckling] Boy, we ain't
as dumb as you think we are.

579
00:35:33,592 --> 00:35:35,928
[Stuttering] But how did,
how did... you?

580
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:38,347
We siphoned your gas
while you were passed out.

581
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:41,308
- Ka-chow.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

582
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:52,110
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

583
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:53,278
Hey, Sheriff.

584
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:55,614
- Why here?
- [Italian] Sono sempre stati qui.

585
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:58,158
- They were better before.
- Stai sempre a parlare.

586
00:35:58,242 --> 00:36:00,118
- Guido!
- Red, can you move over?

587
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:03,038
I want to get a look
at that sexy hot rod.

588
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,916
You know, I used to be
a purty good whistler.

589
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:08,710
I can't do it now, of course,
on account of sometimes

590
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:11,713
I get fluid built up
in my engine block,

591
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:15,133
but Doc said he's gonna fix it.
He can fix about anything.

592
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:17,427
That's why we made him the judge.

593
00:36:17,594 --> 00:36:21,765
Boy, you shoulda heard me on
Giddy-up, Oom Papa Mow Mow.

594
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:23,225
Now, I'm not one to brag

595
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:26,562
but people come purty far
to see me get low on the "Mow-Mow".

596
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:28,063
Oh!

597
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:30,983
- Aw, man, that's just great!
- Hey, what's wrong?

598
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:32,860
My lucky sticker's all dirty.

599
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:35,195
Ah, that ain't nothin'.
I'll clean it for ya.

600
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:39,950
- [Snorting, hacking]
- No, no, no!

601
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:42,369
That won't be necessary.

602
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:46,748
Hey! Hey, big fella!
Yeah, you in the red!

603
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,418
I could use a little hose down.
Help me wash this off.

604
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:52,880
Where's he goin'?

605
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:56,383
Oh, he's a little bit shy, and
he hates you for killin' his flowers.

606
00:36:56,466 --> 00:36:57,968
I shouldn't put up with this.

607
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:00,929
I'm a precision instrument
of speed and aerodynamics.

608
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:04,016
- You hurt your what?
- I'm a very famous racecar!

609
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:07,477
You are a famous racecar?
A real racecar?

610
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:10,189
Yes, I'm a real racecar.
What do you think? Look at me.

611
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:14,234
I have followed racing my entire life.
My whole life!

612
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:16,612
Then you know who I am.
I'm Lightning McQueen.

613
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:18,780
- Lightning McQueen?
- Yes! Yes!

614
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:20,866
I must scream it to the world!

615
00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:25,162
My excitement from the top
of someplace very high!

616
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:27,748
- Do you know many Ferraris?
- No, no, no, no, no.

617
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:30,792
They race on the European circuit.
I'm in the Piston Cup!

618
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:34,505
- [Lightning] What?
- Luigi follow only the Ferraris.

619
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:41,929
Is that what I think it is?

620
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:44,765
[Sally] Customers.

621
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:48,268
Customers!
Customers, everyone! Customers!

622
00:37:48,352 --> 00:37:49,728
- [Sally] OK!
- Customers?

623
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:52,648
[Sally] Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.

624
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:55,275
Make sure your
"Open, please come in" signs are out.

625
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,862
You all know what to do.
All right, nobody panics. Here we go!

626
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:01,615
Van, I just don't see
any on-ramp anywhere.

627
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:06,078
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere.

628
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:08,830
- Honey, please.
- [Sally] Hello.

629
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:11,875
Welcome to Radiator Springs,
gateway to Ornament Valley.

630
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:14,169
Legendary for
its service and hospitality.

631
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:15,295
How can we help you?

632
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:19,424
- We don't need anything, thank you.
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.

633
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:22,719
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.

634
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:25,222
He did the same thing
on our trip to Shakopee.

635
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:28,141
We were headed over there
for the Crazy Days, and we...

636
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:31,270
- OK. Really. We're just peachy, OK?
- What you really need

637
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:35,399
is the sweet taste
of my homemade, organic fuel.

638
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:37,192
No, it doesn't agree with my tank.

639
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:40,445
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
- Good to see you, soldier!

640
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:43,866
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut
for your government surplus needs.

641
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:46,243
- Honey, surplus!
- We have too much surplus.

642
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,662
I do have a map
over at the Cozy Cone Motel.

643
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:51,874
And if you stay, we offer a free
Lincoln Continental breakfast.

644
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:55,711
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map! I have the GPS.

645
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:59,214
- Never need a map again, thank you.
- How 'bout somethin' to drink?

646
00:38:59,298 --> 00:39:03,218
Stop at Flo's V-Eight Café.
Finest fuel on Route 66.

647
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:04,469
No we just topped off.

648
00:39:04,553 --> 00:39:08,390
And if you need tires,
stop by Luigi's Casa Della Tires,

649
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:10,934
home of the Leaning Tower of Tires.

650
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:14,354
- We're trying to find the Interstate.
- But you do need a paint job.

651
00:39:14,438 --> 00:39:17,566
Ramone will paint you up right.
Hey, anything you want!

652
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:19,943
- You know, like a flame job.
- No thanks...

653
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:21,361
Maybe ghost flames!

654
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:23,989
You like old school pinstripin'?
Von Dutch style?

655
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:27,951
- [Both gasp]
- Oh, honey, look. Von Dutch.

656
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:31,038
[Chuckling] OK, no.
We're gonna be going now, OK?

657
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,623
Ow!

658
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:35,918
[Laughs] A little somethin'
to remember us by, OK?

659
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:38,253
- OK!
- Come back soon, OK?

660
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:41,798
I mean, you know where we are!
Tell your friends!

661
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:45,469
[Van] OK! Yes. You bet.

662
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,804
Thanks again, folks.
Bye-bye now.

663
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:50,974
Psst! Psst!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

664
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:53,227
- I know how to get to the Interstate!
- Do ya?

665
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,938
- Minny, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

666
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:57,481
No, not really. But listen.

667
00:39:57,564 --> 00:40:01,193
I'm Lightning McQueen, famous racecar.
I'm being held against my will.

668
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:03,779
I need you to call my team,
so they can come rescue me

669
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:07,699
and get me to California in time for me
to win the Piston Cup. Understand?

670
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:10,953
- [locks beeping]
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

671
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:14,873
No, it's the truth! I'm telling you!
You gotta help me! Don't leave me here!

672
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:18,126
I'm in hillbilly hell!
My IQ's dropping by the second!

673
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:20,295
I'm becoming one of them!

674
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:22,089
- [Lightning echoes]
- [Sighing]

675
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:24,299
OK, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

676
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:26,134
They'll tell friends. You'll see.

677
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:29,054
[Male DJ] We'll be back
for our Hank Williams marathon...

678
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:31,849
- That's good.
- ... after a Piston Cup update.

679
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:35,811
[Kori] Still no sign of Lightning
McQueen. Chick arrived in California

680
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:39,356
and today became the first car
to spend practice time on the track.

681
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:42,609
[Chick] It's nice to get out here
before the other competitors.

682
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:46,446
You know, get a head start.
Gives me an edge.

683
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,990
[Electronic music]

684
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:49,825
[Laughing]

685
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:51,660
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

686
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:57,749
Ha-ha!

687
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:02,588
Yeah!

688
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:05,966
[Crowd shouting and cheering]

689
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:14,141
[Girls chattering and giggling]

690
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:16,518
Hey, McQueen...
Eat your heart out.

691
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:18,854
[Gasping] Oh!

692
00:41:18,896 --> 00:41:20,272
Let me get this straight.

693
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:23,275
I can go when this road is done.
That's the deal, right?

694
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:27,070
- That's what they done did said.
- OK. Outta my way.

695
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:28,238
I got a road to finish.

696
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:31,950
[Grunting and rewing]

697
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:42,503
- He's done!
- Done?

698
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:44,922
- Uh-huh.
- It's only been an hour.

699
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:50,219
- [Bessie groans]
- Ah, I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

700
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,138
Say thanks, and I'll be on my way.
That's all you gotta say.

701
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:57,392
[Mater] Whee-hoo!
I'm the first one on the new road!

702
00:41:57,976 --> 00:41:59,561
Oh!

703
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:03,607
[Vibrating] It rides purty smooth.

704
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:07,319
- It looks awful!
- Well, it matches the rest of the town.

705
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:10,906
- Oh!
- [Blubbering]

706
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:13,283
Red.

707
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:17,246
Who do you think you are?

708
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:20,582
Look, Doc said when I finish,
I could go. That was the deal.

709
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:24,127
The deal was you fix the road,
not make it worse.

710
00:42:24,169 --> 00:42:26,630
Now, scrape it off!
Start over again.

711
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:30,342
Hey, look, grandpa,
I'm not a bulldozer. I'm a racecar.

712
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:31,885
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

713
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:36,223
Is that right? Then why don't we
just have a little race? Me and you.

714
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:40,102
- What?
- [Chuckling] Me and you. That a joke?

715
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:42,521
If you win, you go and I fix the road.

716
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:45,274
If I win, you do the road my way.

717
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:46,900
Doc, what're you doin'?

718
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:49,111
I don't mean to be rude here,

719
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:52,906
but you probably go zero to sixty in,
like, what? Three-point-five years?

720
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,492
Then I reckon
you ain't got nothin' to worry about.

721
00:42:55,576 --> 00:43:00,247
You know what, old-timer?
That's a wonderful idea. Let's race.

722
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:04,501
[Sheriff] Gentlemen,
this will be a one-lap race.

723
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:09,089
You will drive to Willy's Butte,
go around Willy's Butte and come back.

724
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:12,092
There will be no bumpin',
no cheatin', no spittin',

725
00:43:12,176 --> 00:43:14,678
no bitin', no road rage, no maimin',

726
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:19,892
no oil slickin', no pushin', no shovin',
no backstabbin', no road-hoggin',

727
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:21,727
and no lollygaggin'.

728
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,353
Speed. I'm speed.

729
00:43:23,437 --> 00:43:25,981
Float like a Cadillac,
sting like a Beemer.

730
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:27,107
[Luigi laughs]

731
00:43:27,232 --> 00:43:32,029
My friend Guido, he dream to give
a real racecar a pit stop.

732
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:34,615
- Peet stop!
- Uh... [chuckles]

733
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:37,576
The race is only one lap, guys.

734
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:40,120
Uno lappo! Don't need any help.

735
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:44,041
- I work solo mio.
- Fine. Race your way.

736
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:49,213
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- OK.

737
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:51,298
Gentlemen...

738
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:54,801
...start your engines!

739
00:43:56,929 --> 00:43:58,597
[Engine sputters]

740
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:01,517
[Rewing furiously]

741
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:03,936
- !Hijole! Check that out!
- Whoa.

742
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:07,105
Great idea, Doc.
Now the road will never get done.

743
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:08,774
Luigi?

744
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:12,027
[Chuckling] On your mark, get set...

745
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:14,363
Uno for the money,
due for the show,

746
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:20,118
tre to get ready, and quattro
to... I can't believe it. Go!

747
00:44:21,453 --> 00:44:22,538
[Giggling]

748
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:26,041
[Cheering]

749
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:29,920
Huh?

750
00:44:30,587 --> 00:44:33,090
Doc... the flag means go.

751
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:36,510
Remember the fl...
Here we go. Go.

752
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:39,304
Doc, what are you doing, man?

753
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:42,933
Oh, dear. It would seem
I'm off to a poor start.

754
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:46,144
Well, better late than never.
Come on, Mater.

755
00:44:46,228 --> 00:44:48,981
- Might need a little help.
- Uh... OK.

756
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:52,109
You got your tow cable?

757
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:54,403
Well, yeah,
I always got my tow cable. Why?

758
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:56,738
[Doc] Oh, just in case.

759
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:07,499
[Yelling] Ow! Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

760
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:09,293
No, no, no, no, no!

761
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:11,837
- Oh, man!
- Whoa.

762
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:14,882
- Ow!
- [Fillmore] Bad trip, man.

763
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:16,383
[Rewing]

764
00:45:18,051 --> 00:45:24,057
Hey! Was that floatin' like a Cadillac
or was that stingin' like a Beemer?

765
00:45:24,141 --> 00:45:26,476
- I'm confused.
- [Chuckling]

766
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,645
[Doc] You drive like you fix roads.

767
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:31,940
Lousy! Have fun fishin', Mater.

768
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:37,571
[Gasps] Ah!

769
00:45:38,322 --> 00:45:41,283
I'm startin' to think he knowed
you was gonna crash!

770
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:44,453
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

771
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:49,499
I can make a little turn on dirt.

772
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:51,001
You think?

773
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:55,547
No. And now I'm a day behind.
I'm never gonna get outta here!

774
00:45:55,631 --> 00:45:58,091
Hey, <i>ése!</i>
You need a new paint job, man!

775
00:45:58,175 --> 00:46:01,136
- [Lightning] No, thank you.
- How 'bout some organic fuel?

776
00:46:01,178 --> 00:46:03,555
- That freak juice?
- [Lightning] Pass.

777
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:08,101
Whoo! Watchin' him is makin' me thirsty.
Anybody else want somethin' to drink?

778
00:46:08,185 --> 00:46:09,770
Nah, not me, Flo.

779
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:12,314
I'm on one of them there special diets.

780
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:16,985
I'm a precisional instrument
of speed and aero-matics.

781
00:46:17,528 --> 00:46:19,821
"You race like you fix roads."

782
00:46:19,863 --> 00:46:24,660
[Grunting] I'll show him.
[Grunting] I will show him!

783
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:37,339
- [Tar splattering]
- Oh, great! I hate it!

784
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:41,009
- Hate, hate, hate, hate it!
- [Chuckles] Music. Sweet music.

785
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:44,805
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

786
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:47,599
[Lightning]
Radiator Springs, a happy place!

787
00:46:47,683 --> 00:46:50,686
OK, Bessie, you think that's funny?

788
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:57,025
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

789
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,164
Wow.

790
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:13,208
[Mater] Mornin', Sally!

791
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:18,463
Hey, look at this here fancy new road
that Lightnin' McQueen done just made!

792
00:47:18,547 --> 00:47:20,549
Yes! Uh, amazing!

793
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:24,678
Whoa-ho! Yeah! [sighing]

794
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:28,932
Oh, Ramone! Mama ain't
seen you that low in years.

795
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:31,560
I haven't seen a road like this
in years.

796
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:35,772
- Well, then let's cruise, baby.
- Low and slow.

797
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:38,066
[Italian] É bellissima! It's beautiful!

798
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:41,862
Guido, look, it's-a like
it was paved by angels.

799
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:44,072
Boy, I tell you what.

800
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:46,992
I bet even the roads on the moon
ain't this smooth.

801
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:48,744
Doc, look at this!

802
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:51,747
Shoulda tossed him into
the cactus a lot sooner, huh?

803
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:55,292
Well, he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

804
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:58,337
Guido, look at Luigi!

805
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:00,672
This is fantastico!

806
00:48:00,756 --> 00:48:04,218
That looks like fun!
Mater, I got dibs, next turn!

807
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:08,597
Hey, Luigi, this new road
makes your place look like a dump.

808
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:11,934
That crazy old devil woman.

809
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:15,812
[Sighs] Oh!

810
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,731
She's right!

811
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:19,358
- Ah!
- Guido!

812
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:23,195
Huh. That punk actually did a good job.

813
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:28,283
Well, now... where the heck is he?

814
00:48:34,623 --> 00:48:37,334
Sheriff!
Is he makin' another run for it?

815
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:40,796
No, no. He ran outta asphalt
in the middle of the night,

816
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:43,215
and asked me if he could
come down here.

817
00:48:43,298 --> 00:48:45,676
All he's tryin' to do
is make that there turn.

818
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:48,595
[Lightning] No, no, no, no! Oh, great.

819
00:48:49,054 --> 00:48:51,598
Perfect turns on every track
I've ever raced on.

820
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:57,771
Sheriff, why don't you go get yourself
a quart of oil at Flo's.

821
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,231
I'll keep an eye on him.

822
00:48:59,314 --> 00:49:03,193
Well, thanks, Doc.
I've been feelin' a quart low.

823
00:49:04,862 --> 00:49:07,656
[Engine rewing]

824
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:13,036
[Screaming]

825
00:49:14,663 --> 00:49:16,832
[Spitting]

826
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:20,043
This ain't asphalt, son. This is dirt.

827
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,838
Oh, great. What do you want?
You here to gloat?

828
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:26,258
You don't have three-wheel brakes,
so you got to pitch it hard,

829
00:49:26,341 --> 00:49:29,803
break it loose and then
just drive it with the throttle.

830
00:49:29,887 --> 00:49:32,973
Give it too much, you'll be
outta the dirt and into the tulips.

831
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:36,143
So you're a judge,
a doctor and a racing expert.

832
00:49:36,226 --> 00:49:37,853
I'll put it simple.

833
00:49:37,936 --> 00:49:42,107
If you're goin' hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turnin' right.

834
00:49:43,192 --> 00:49:48,572
Oh... Right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

835
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:50,449
Or should I say, "No, thank you"?

836
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:54,119
Because in Opposite World,
maybe that really means, "Thank you"!

837
00:49:56,914 --> 00:50:00,334
Crazy grandpa car. What an idiot!

838
00:50:01,585 --> 00:50:03,378
[Groans]

839
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:09,885
[Lightning] Turn right to go left.

840
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:13,180
Hmm...

841
00:50:13,263 --> 00:50:14,306
Whoa!

842
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:18,101
- Oh!
- [Car crashing]

843
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:22,523
- Ow! Oh, that...
- [cactus crashing]

844
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:27,486
[Screaming] Ow!

845
00:50:28,946 --> 00:50:32,199
Turn right to go left.
Guess what. I tried it.

846
00:50:32,282 --> 00:50:35,369
You know what? This crazy thing
happened... I went right!

847
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:38,830
You keep talkin' to yourself,
people'll think you're crazy.

848
00:50:38,914 --> 00:50:42,835
- Thanks for the tip.
- What? I wasn't talkin' to you!

849
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:53,262
- Oh, Guido, e bellissimo!
- Che cosa?

850
00:50:53,345 --> 00:50:57,724
- It looks great! This is great!
- Ti piace, eh? Si, si, bellissimo.

851
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:00,227
[Grunts, passes gas]

852
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:02,312
Oh, Lord.

853
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:04,022
- [Chuckles]
- [Sheriff] Mater!

854
00:51:04,106 --> 00:51:06,275
I need you
to watch the prisoner tonight.

855
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:09,611
Well, dad-gum! Wait a minute.
What if he tries to run again?

856
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:12,531
Just let him run outta gas
and tow him on back.

857
00:51:12,614 --> 00:51:15,075
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir!

858
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:17,828
[Groaning] Oh...

859
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:20,581
While I'm stuck here
paving this stinkin' road,

860
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:23,208
Chick's in California schmoozing Dinoco.

861
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:26,545
My Dinoco. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who's touching me?

862
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:28,922
You have a slow leak. Guido, he fix.

863
00:51:29,006 --> 00:51:31,008
You make-a such a nice new road.

864
00:51:31,091 --> 00:51:33,760
You come to my shop.
Luigi take-a good care of you.

865
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:35,429
Even though you not a Ferrari.

866
00:51:35,512 --> 00:51:39,600
You buy four tires,
I give you a full-a size spare

867
00:51:39,683 --> 00:51:43,520
- absolutely free!
- Look, I get all my tires for free.

868
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:47,107
[Chuckling] I like your style, eh?

869
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:50,777
You drive the hard bargain.
OK. Luigi make you a new deal.

870
00:51:50,861 --> 00:51:54,281
You buy one tire,
I give you three for free!

871
00:51:54,364 --> 00:51:56,033
[Flo] Oh, would you look at that?

872
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:58,243
Ramone, Ramone!

873
00:51:58,327 --> 00:52:00,412
[Luigi] Then Luigi make you
a new new deal.

874
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:03,457
[Lightning] No, no, no, no.
Deal me out. Pass. No, thank you.

875
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,169
- No, no, no, no. No.
- This is it. My last offer.

876
00:52:07,252 --> 00:52:11,965
You buy one tire, I give you
seven-a snow tires for free!

877
00:52:12,049 --> 00:52:14,885
Done. You interested, you call me.
You know where I am.

878
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:16,220
[Exhales deeply]

879
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:17,471
Ah!

880
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:19,681
Stop! Let me...

881
00:52:21,058 --> 00:52:23,894
Oh, Red, you missed a spot.
See it right there?

882
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:25,979
- No! No!
- On the hood right there.

883
00:52:26,063 --> 00:52:29,399
Stop, stop! That's cold!

884
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:31,985
Help! Please! Stop!

885
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:35,405
- [Coughing, sputtering]
- Thanks, Red.

886
00:52:36,657 --> 00:52:37,908
What was that for?

887
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:40,118
- Do you want to stay at the Cozy Cone?
- Huh?

888
00:52:40,202 --> 00:52:41,662
If you do, you gotta be clean.

889
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:44,289
'Cause even in hillbilly hell
we have standards.

890
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:46,083
What, I? I don't get it.

891
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:48,752
I thought I'd say thank you
for doin' a great job.

892
00:52:48,836 --> 00:52:52,047
So I thought I'd let you stay with me.
I mean, not with me!

893
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:56,760
But there. Not with me there,
but there in your own cozy cone.

894
00:52:56,844 --> 00:53:00,722
- And I'd be in my cone, and it's...
- Wait. Wait, you're being nice to me.

895
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:03,183
If you want to stay
at the dirty impound, fine.

896
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:06,520
- I understand you criminal types.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK.

897
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:09,773
- Yeah, the Cozy Cone.
- [Sally] It's newly refurbished.

898
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:13,318
[Lightning chuckles] Yeah,
it's like a clever little twist.

899
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:17,531
The motel's made out of caution cones,
which, of course, cars try to avoid.

900
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:20,951
But now we're gonna stay in them.
That's funny.

901
00:53:22,452 --> 00:53:24,705
Figure that all out on your own,
did you?

902
00:53:25,664 --> 00:53:28,125
Cone number one, if you want.

903
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:31,587
Oh...

904
00:53:32,754 --> 00:53:36,466
Hey, do I spy a little
pinstriping tattoo back there?

905
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,636
Oh... [chuckles]
That's just a... Oh!

906
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,889
[Both chuckle]

907
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:45,559
Oh, you saw that? Yeah.
Just gonna be going.

908
00:53:45,642 --> 00:53:48,270
Gonna... Yeah.

909
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:55,611
- You know, I knew this girl Doreen.
- [Gasps]

910
00:53:55,652 --> 00:53:57,154
Good-lookin' girl.

911
00:53:57,237 --> 00:54:00,532
Looked just like a Jaguar,
only she was a truck!

912
00:54:00,616 --> 00:54:04,077
You know, I used to crash into her,
just so I could spoke to her.

913
00:54:05,204 --> 00:54:07,664
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

914
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:11,877
Hey, I know somethin' we can do tonight,
'cause I'm in charge of watchin' you!

915
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,131
No, Mater, I gotta finish this road,
and I have to get out of here.

916
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:19,760
Well, that's all right,
Mr. I Can't Turn On Dirt.

917
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:22,137
You probably couldn't handle it anyway.

918
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:23,972
Whoa, whoa, easy now, Mater.

919
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:27,017
You know who you're talkin' to?
This is Lightning McQueen.

920
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,436
I can handle anything.

921
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:34,316
- [Whispering] I'm not doin' this.
- Come on. You'll love it! [chuckles]

922
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:38,111
- [Mater] Tractor-tippin's fun.
- [Lightning] This is ridiculous.

923
00:54:38,195 --> 00:54:40,656
- [Tractors snore]
- [Mater] All right, listen.

924
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:44,701
When I say go, we go.
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

925
00:54:44,785 --> 00:54:46,620
Whoa! Wait! Who's Frank?

926
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:49,581
[Lightning whispering] Mater!

927
00:54:49,665 --> 00:54:51,083
Wait, Mater!

928
00:54:52,876 --> 00:54:54,211
OK, here's what you do.

929
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:57,673
You just sneak up in front of 'em,
and then honk.

930
00:54:57,756 --> 00:55:00,259
And they do the rest. Watch this.

931
00:55:07,307 --> 00:55:09,142
- [Honking loudly]
- Oh!

932
00:55:09,184 --> 00:55:14,398
Oh... Oh! Oh... [mooing]

933
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:18,277
[Gas sloshing, backfiring]

934
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,238
[Laughing loudly]

935
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:24,449
I swear, tractors is so dumb!

936
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:28,328
I tell you what, buddy,
it don't get much better than this.

937
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:30,998
Yep, you're livin' the dream, Mater boy.

938
00:55:33,959 --> 00:55:36,545
- [Honking]
- Oh!

939
00:55:36,628 --> 00:55:40,215
Oh! Oh... [mooing]

940
00:55:40,299 --> 00:55:43,218
[Gas sloshing, backfiring]

941
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:47,264
[Laughing] I don't care who you are,
that's funny right there.

942
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:49,099
Oh, your turn, bud.

943
00:55:49,183 --> 00:55:51,560
Mater, I can't.
I don't even have a horn.

944
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:53,896
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

945
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:54,938
[Clucking]

946
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:58,400
Fine. Stop! Stop, OK?
All right. I'll do something.

947
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:08,410
[Snoring]

948
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:18,795
- [Rewing engine]
- Oh!

949
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:23,258
[All exclaiming and mooing]

950
00:56:29,848 --> 00:56:33,143
[All gurgling]

951
00:56:34,186 --> 00:56:38,273
[All backfiring]

952
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:46,156
[Angry mooing]

953
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:48,992
[Mooing]

954
00:56:49,326 --> 00:56:50,702
That's Frank.

955
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:55,791
- [Bellowing angrily]
- [Shouting]

956
00:56:57,084 --> 00:57:00,587
- [Mooing]
- [Engine rewing]

957
00:57:05,843 --> 00:57:10,180
[Mater laughing]

958
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:12,975
Run!

959
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:15,018
- Here he comes, look out!
- [Bellowing]

960
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:17,646
[Laughing] Whoa!

961
00:57:18,856 --> 00:57:20,232
[Screaming]

962
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:23,652
Run! He's gonna get ya!

963
00:57:30,534 --> 00:57:32,995
[Mater laughing]

964
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:44,089
Oh! Customers!

965
00:57:45,048 --> 00:57:46,800
Oh!

966
00:57:48,594 --> 00:57:50,179
Ah, no, no, no.

967
00:57:50,262 --> 00:57:52,014
Oof! Oh!

968
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:56,435
[Mater] Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghostlight!

969
00:57:56,518 --> 00:58:00,022
- I can't wait, Mater.
- Oh, yeah, I'm tellin' ya!

970
00:58:00,272 --> 00:58:04,359
Oh, boy,
you gotta admit that was fun!

971
00:58:04,443 --> 00:58:06,403
Oh, yeah... yeah.

972
00:58:06,445 --> 00:58:09,531
Well, we better get you
back to the impound lot.

973
00:58:09,615 --> 00:58:12,826
You know, actually,
Sally's gonna let me stay at the motel.

974
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:13,869
Oh...

975
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:19,249
- Gettin' cozy at the Cone, is we?
- Oh, come... No. No, are you kidding?

976
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:23,587
Besides, she can't stand me.
And I don't like her, to be honest.

977
00:58:23,629 --> 00:58:27,549
Yeah, you probably right.
Hey, look, there's Miss Sally!

978
00:58:27,591 --> 00:58:30,344
- Where, where?
- [Laughing]

979
00:58:30,427 --> 00:58:33,013
- You're in love with Miss Sally.
- No, I'm not.

980
00:58:33,096 --> 00:58:35,224
- [Mater] Yes, you do.
- [Lightning] No way.

981
00:58:35,307 --> 00:58:36,517
- Way.
- Come on, look...

982
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,019
- You're in love with Miss Sally!
- Real mature.

983
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:40,729
- You're in love!
- Real grown up.

984
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:42,648
- You love her. You love her.
- Wait...

985
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:44,733
You love her!
You love her. You love her.

986
00:58:44,816 --> 00:58:46,360
All right. OK. Mater, enough!

987
00:58:46,443 --> 00:58:48,403
- Will you stop that?
- Stop what?

988
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:51,782
Driving backwards. It's creeping me out.
You're gonna wreck.

989
00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:56,787
Wreck? Shoot!
I'm the world's best backwards driver!

990
00:58:56,828 --> 00:58:59,957
You just watch this right here,
lover boy. Wee-hee!

991
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,709
[Lightning] What are you doing?
Watch out! Look out!

992
00:59:02,793 --> 00:59:04,169
Mater? Mater!

993
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:07,840
- Mater!
- [Laughing]

994
00:59:18,976 --> 00:59:20,435
Hey, take it easy, Mater!

995
00:59:20,477 --> 00:59:22,855
[Screaming happily]

996
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:27,192
Oof!

997
00:59:27,276 --> 00:59:30,654
[Blubbering] Yee-hee!

998
00:59:31,154 --> 00:59:32,990
[Chuckling] He's nuts.

999
00:59:34,825 --> 00:59:36,535
No need to watch where I'm goin'.

[Chuckling] Yeah,
maybe I'll use it in my big race.

1004
00:59:51,717 --> 00:59:55,262
What's so important
about this race of yours, anyway?

1005
00:59:56,763 --> 01:00:00,475
It's not just a race.
We're talking about the Piston Cup!

1006

I've been dreaming about it
my whole life!

1007
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:05,981
I'll be the first rookie in history
ever to win it.

Hey, you think maybe one day I can
get a ride in one of them helicopters?

1015

I mean, I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

1171
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:46,640

like that Interstate.

It rose, it fell, it curved.

01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:49,673
Now, what was I
supposed to do after that?

1332
01:24:49,756 --> 01:24:52,050
[# The Chords: Sh-Boom]

1333
01:25:13,697 --> 01:25:16,491
[Gasping] They fixed their neon!

1334
01:25:23,874 --> 01:25:28,879
- Low and slow?
- Oh, yeah, baby! [chuckling]

1335
01:25:28,962 --> 01:25:31,548
[Flo laughs and shrieks]

1336
01:25:33,217 --> 01:25:36,512
Just like in its heyday, right?

1337
01:25:36,595 --> 01:25:39,973
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.

1338
01:26:01,578 --> 01:26:03,956
[Chuckling]

1339
01:26:07,376 --> 01:26:08,836
Shall we cruise?

1340
01:26:08,919 --> 01:26:11,213
Oh, thank you, dear. I'd love to!

1341
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:12,756
- No, no, no.
- Lizzie!

1342
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:17,177
I remember when Stanley
first asked me to take a drive with him.

1343
01:26:17,261 --> 01:26:20,097
Hey, Miss Sally.
May I have this cruise?

1344
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:23,559
- Of course, Mater.
- Uh-uh-uh!

1345
01:26:24,977 --> 01:26:27,896
[Mooing]

1346
01:26:30,023 --> 01:26:34,403
...and again and I said, "No."
He asked me again, and I said, "No."

1347
01:26:34,444 --> 01:26:38,782
But, oh, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two-cylinder.

1348
01:26:38,866 --> 01:26:42,244
Finally I said,
"All right, one little drive."

1349
01:26:44,413 --> 01:26:47,416
- Oh!
- [Mater chuckling]

1350
01:26:51,795 --> 01:26:53,881
- Hey!
- Thanks, Mater.

1351
01:26:53,964 --> 01:26:56,258
Good evenin', you two.

1352
01:26:58,802 --> 01:27:04,016
Oh, Stanley,
I wish you could see this.

1353
01:27:08,145 --> 01:27:11,940
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh, I don't know, Flo.

1354
01:27:11,982 --> 01:27:17,654
I haven't had a chance to find out.
But I am going to find out. Hello.

1355
01:27:17,738 --> 01:27:20,324
Not that. That.

1356
01:27:20,407 --> 01:27:20,449
[Sally gasps] Customers?

1357
01:27:20,449 --> 01:27:22,784
[Sally gasps] Customers?

1358
01:27:22,868 --> 01:27:25,537
Customers, everybody!
And a lot of 'em!

1359
01:27:25,621 --> 01:27:27,789
You know what to do.
Just like we rehearsed.

1360
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:28,832
[All gasp]

1361
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:31,502
It's the ghostlight!

1362
01:27:31,585 --> 01:27:34,171
We have found McQueen.
We have found McQueen!

1363
01:27:35,047 --> 01:27:36,507
McQueen, over here!

1364
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:39,343
- Wait, excuse me.
- Is it true you've been in rehab?

1365
01:27:39,426 --> 01:27:41,553
- Did you have a nervous breakdown?
- What?

1366
01:27:41,637 --> 01:27:44,348
- McQueen's wearing whitewalls!
- Your tires balding?

1367
01:27:44,431 --> 01:27:45,432
[Sally] Stickers!

1368
01:27:45,474 --> 01:27:47,643
- Was McQueen your prisoner?
- Shoot, no!

1369
01:27:47,726 --> 01:27:50,187
We're best buds!
I ain't braggin' or nothin',

1370
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:53,482
but I was in charge of huntin' him down
if he tried to escape.

1371
01:27:53,524 --> 01:27:55,108
Sally! Sally!

1372
01:27:55,192 --> 01:27:57,277
Will you still race for the Piston Cup?

1373
01:27:57,361 --> 01:27:59,071
- Stickers?
- Sally!

1374
01:27:59,154 --> 01:28:01,532
- Come on, give us some bolt!
- [Horn honking]

1375
01:28:01,615 --> 01:28:06,119
You're here!
Thank the manufacturer! You're alive!

1376
01:28:06,203 --> 01:28:09,540
- Mack?
- You're here! I can't believe it!

1377
01:28:09,623 --> 01:28:13,502
[Chuckling] You are a sight
for sore headlights!

1378
01:28:13,544 --> 01:28:16,296
I'm so sorry I lost you, boss.
I'll make it up to you!

1379
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,215
Mack, I, I can't believe you're here.

1380
01:28:18,298 --> 01:28:20,884
[Harv] Is that the world's
fastest racing machine?

1381
01:28:20,968 --> 01:28:23,470
- Is that Harv?
- Yeah. He's in the back.

1382
01:28:25,097 --> 01:28:28,016
- Show us the bolt!
- Get back, you oil-thirsty parasites!

1383
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:31,353
- Where's the old McQueen?
- Actually, this is my good side here.

1384
01:28:31,687 --> 01:28:33,689
- Harv! Harv!
- Give us the bolt!

1385
01:28:34,648 --> 01:28:35,649
- Harv?
- Come on!

1386
01:28:35,691 --> 01:28:38,402
- Kid, I'm over here!
- How you doin', buddy?

1387
01:28:38,485 --> 01:28:41,154
My star client disappears
off the face of the earth!

1388
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:43,407
- How do you think I'm doing?
- I can explain.

1389
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:47,870
I'm doing great! You're everywhere!
Radio, TV, the papers!

1390
01:28:47,953 --> 01:28:50,998
You can't buy this kind of publicity!
What do you need me for?

1391
01:28:51,081 --> 01:28:53,542
That's just a figure of speech,
by the way. You signed a contract.

1392
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:55,919
Where are you?
I can't even find you on my GPS.

1393
01:28:56,003 --> 01:28:58,505
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.

1394
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:01,800
- You know Route 66? It's still here!
- Yeah, that's great, kid.

1395
01:29:01,884 --> 01:29:03,051
Playtime is over, pal.

1396
01:29:03,135 --> 01:29:06,972
While the world's been trying to
find you Dinoco has had no one to woo.

1397
01:29:07,055 --> 01:29:08,724
- Who are they gonna woo?
- Chick!

1398
01:29:08,807 --> 01:29:12,436
Bingo. In fact, check out
what's on the plasma right now.

1399
01:29:12,519 --> 01:29:14,688
- Show us the thunder!
- You want thunder?

1400
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:18,400
You want thunder?
Ka-chicka, ka-chicka!

1401
01:29:18,442 --> 01:29:21,737
- Hey, that's my bit!
- <i>You've gotta get to Cali, pronto!</i>

1402
01:29:21,778 --> 01:29:25,782
Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?

1403
01:29:25,866 --> 01:29:27,576
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1404
01:29:27,743 --> 01:29:29,453
No, wait. Where are you goin'?

1405
01:29:29,536 --> 01:29:32,789
Get in the trailer, baby. Kid!
You want a bigger trailer?

1406
01:29:36,919 --> 01:29:39,755
Sally, I... I want you to...

1407
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:43,467
Look, I wish... [sighs]

1408
01:29:44,927 --> 01:29:47,804
Thank you. Thanks for everything.

1409
01:29:47,888 --> 01:29:49,890
[Groans, chuckles]

1410
01:29:49,973 --> 01:29:55,187
- It was just a road.
- No. It was much more than that.

1411
01:29:58,315 --> 01:30:01,527
Hey, kid! We gotta go.
Harv's goin' crazy!

1412
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:04,821
He's gonna have me fired if
I don't get you in the truck right now!

1413
01:30:04,905 --> 01:30:07,616
- Mack, just... hold it for...
- You should go.

1414
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:09,952
- I know, but...
- Good luck in California.

1415
01:30:12,329 --> 01:30:15,332
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

1416
01:30:15,415 --> 01:30:17,501
- McQueen, come on!
- Sally...

1417
01:30:17,584 --> 01:30:20,796
- Sally!
- Show us the bolt, McQueen! The bolt!

1418
01:30:20,879 --> 01:30:22,965
Hey, Lightning, show us the bolt!

1419
01:30:28,804 --> 01:30:31,598
- Come on, get in the trailer.
- Where's the old McQueen?

1420
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:34,017
- The bolt!
- That's it. That's right, let's go!

1421
01:30:34,101 --> 01:30:36,812
You're a big shining star.
You're a superstar.

1422
01:30:36,854 --> 01:30:39,147
You don't belong there, anyway.

1423
01:30:39,231 --> 01:30:42,234
Whoa... Wait...
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1424
01:30:42,693 --> 01:30:44,987
[Engine starts]

1425
01:30:45,028 --> 01:30:47,281
Hey, guys!
McQueen's leavin' in the truck!

1426
01:30:54,413 --> 01:30:56,790
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1427
01:30:56,832 --> 01:30:59,251
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

1428
01:31:07,718 --> 01:31:11,471
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.

1429
01:31:12,097 --> 01:31:15,225
Best for everyone or best for you?

1430
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:34,536
I didn't get to say goodbye to him.

1431
01:32:20,123 --> 01:32:22,417
[Light buzzing]

1432
01:32:34,096 --> 01:32:37,432
[Bob] Hello, race fans. Welcome
to what has become, quite simply,

1433
01:32:37,474 --> 01:32:39,768
the biggest event
in the history of racing.

1434
01:32:39,852 --> 01:32:42,104
A three-way battle for the Piston Cup!

1435
01:32:42,145 --> 01:32:44,606
[Darrell] There's a crowd
of nearly 200,000 cars

1436
01:32:44,690 --> 01:32:47,234
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

1437
01:32:47,317 --> 01:32:51,655
Tickets to this race are hotter than a
black leather seat on a hot summer day!

1438
01:32:51,738 --> 01:32:54,283
[Bob] The King, Chick Hicks
and Lightning McQueen

1439
01:32:54,366 --> 01:32:57,703
in a 200 lap, winner-takes-all,
tiebreaker race.

1440
01:32:57,786 --> 01:33:00,998
[Darrell] I got a lotta miles on me,
but let me tell you somethin'.

1441
01:33:01,081 --> 01:33:05,085
I never thought I'd see anything
like this. This is exciting!

1442
01:33:05,127 --> 01:33:07,462
[Bob] In fact, the country
has almost shut down

1443
01:33:07,546 --> 01:33:11,633
to watch what many experts
are calling "the race of the century."

1444
01:33:11,717 --> 01:33:14,344
Hey, King!
Good luck in your last race.

1445
01:33:14,428 --> 01:33:18,515
- You've sure been an inspiration to me.
- Thanks, Junior. Appreciate it.

1446
01:33:18,599 --> 01:33:21,685
- Hey, be careful out there, OK?
- Yeah, man.

1447
01:33:21,768 --> 01:33:22,769
[Mia] He's hot!

1448
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:25,480
Wanna know the forecast?
I'll give you the forecast.

1449
01:33:25,564 --> 01:33:28,650
A 100 percent chance of thunder!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1450
01:33:28,734 --> 01:33:31,278
Say it with me!
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1451
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:34,281
Hey, you! No admittance
without a garage pass.

1452
01:33:34,323 --> 01:33:37,117
Oh, it's OK.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

1453
01:33:37,159 --> 01:33:40,287
Hey, Marco, it's a beautiful day
for a race, isn't it?

1454
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:45,334
- Absolutely, Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

1455
01:33:45,417 --> 01:33:49,338
Mario Andretti knows my name!
You gotta let me in now!

1456
01:33:49,379 --> 01:33:50,672
[Guard] Sorry, pal.

1457
01:33:50,714 --> 01:33:55,010
[Lightning] OK, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

1458
01:33:55,761 --> 01:33:58,555
I am speed.

1459
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:00,224
[Cars whizzing]

1460
01:34:00,307 --> 01:34:01,517
Victory.

1461
01:34:01,558 --> 01:34:03,685
One winner, two losers.

1462
01:34:03,769 --> 01:34:05,729
[Engine rewing]

1463
01:34:05,812 --> 01:34:11,318
Speed. Speed. Speed. Speed...

1464
01:34:11,401 --> 01:34:13,987
[birds singing]

1465
01:34:15,447 --> 01:34:16,448
[Knock on door]

1466
01:34:16,532 --> 01:34:18,116
[Mack] Lightnin'! You ready?

1467
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,869
[Gasping] Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'm ready.

1468
01:34:24,164 --> 01:34:27,167
[Indistinct chatter]

1469
01:34:34,216 --> 01:34:37,052
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

1470
01:34:37,135 --> 01:34:39,721
Don't worry about it, kid.
It's the least I could do.

1471
01:34:39,805 --> 01:34:42,224
After all, "Gas Can"
is my middle name.

1472
01:34:42,266 --> 01:34:44,643
- It is?
- Ah... Not really.

1473
01:34:50,023 --> 01:34:52,025
[All shouting]

1474
01:34:52,067 --> 01:34:53,819
[Gulping]

1475
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:03,328
Uh-oh

1476
01:35:07,332 --> 01:35:09,960
- [cheering, laughing]
- [Giggling]

1477
01:35:14,214 --> 01:35:17,176
Nelson! Zoom in.
Ready, 16? Take 16.

1478
01:35:17,342 --> 01:35:19,595
[Bob] And there he is,
Lightning McQueen!

1479
01:35:19,636 --> 01:35:22,764
Missing all week, and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

1480
01:35:22,848 --> 01:35:25,267
In a little town
called Radiator Springs.

1481
01:35:25,309 --> 01:35:28,395
[Darrell] Wearin' whitewall tires,
of all things.

1482
01:35:29,521 --> 01:35:32,649
- Oh!
- Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1483
01:35:32,733 --> 01:35:33,901
[Chuckling]

1484
01:35:33,942 --> 01:35:36,278
Hey, where you been?
I've been kinda lonely.

1485
01:35:36,361 --> 01:35:39,281
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean, except the Dinoco folks.

1486
01:35:39,323 --> 01:35:42,326
And the twins. Of course.
The ones that used to be your fans,

1487
01:35:42,409 --> 01:35:45,579
but now they're my fans.
Listen to what the twins think...

1488
01:35:52,419 --> 01:35:54,463
Agh! Shoot!

1489
01:35:54,546 --> 01:35:57,674
[Darrell] Boogity, boogity, boogity,
boys! Let's go racin'!

1490
01:36:01,303 --> 01:36:03,847
[Crowd cheering]

1491
01:36:03,972 --> 01:36:05,516
Come on, you can do it!

1492
01:36:05,599 --> 01:36:07,601
Come on, King, make us proud, boy!

1493
01:36:08,852 --> 01:36:12,022
[Bob] Fifty laps down, and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

1494
01:36:12,105 --> 01:36:15,317
[Darrell] McQueen's got a run on him!
He's lookin' to the inside!

1495
01:36:17,486 --> 01:36:19,655
Oh! Chick slammed the door on him!

1496
01:36:19,738 --> 01:36:22,157
[Bob] Chick's not
making it easy on him today.

1497
01:36:22,199 --> 01:36:23,951
[Darrell] He lost momentum,

1498
01:36:23,992 --> 01:36:26,328
and now he's gonna have to
chase him back down!

1499
01:36:30,207 --> 01:36:33,210
- [Soft music]
- [Birds singing]

1500
01:36:34,545 --> 01:36:35,629
[Breaks squealing]

1501
01:36:35,712 --> 01:36:37,798
[Bob] McQueen spins out in the infield!

1502
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:38,882
[All gasp]

1503
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,346
[Chuckling] Just me
and the old man, fellas.

1504
01:36:44,429 --> 01:36:47,975
- McQueen just doesn't have it today.
- [All laugh]

1505
01:36:48,016 --> 01:36:49,059
[Groans]

1506
01:36:49,142 --> 01:36:53,188
- Hey, kid, are you all right?
- I don't know, Mack.

1507
01:36:53,272 --> 01:36:54,690
I don't think I...

1508
01:36:54,773 --> 01:36:57,526
[Doc] I didn't come all this way
to see you quit.

1509
01:36:57,734 --> 01:36:59,278
Doc?

1510
01:37:01,947 --> 01:37:04,575
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

1511
01:37:04,658 --> 01:37:08,412
I knew you needed a crew chief,
but I didn't know it was this bad.

1512
01:37:08,495 --> 01:37:10,372
You said you'd never come back.

1513
01:37:10,455 --> 01:37:14,042
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say goodbye.

1514
01:37:14,126 --> 01:37:17,045
Goodbye! OK, I'm good.

1515
01:37:17,087 --> 01:37:18,964
[Chuckles]

1516
01:37:21,008 --> 01:37:24,511
All right, if you can drive as good
as you can fix a road

1517
01:37:24,553 --> 01:37:27,848
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

1518
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:29,892
Now, get back out there!

1519
01:37:32,144 --> 01:37:35,105
Hot snot, we are back in business!
Guido! Luigi!

1520
01:37:35,189 --> 01:37:37,482
You're goin' up
against professional pit crews.

1521
01:37:37,566 --> 01:37:40,736
- You're gonna have to be fast.
- They will not know what bit them!

1522
01:37:40,777 --> 01:37:42,487
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1523
01:37:42,571 --> 01:37:45,949
Find a groove that works for you
and get that lap back.

1524
01:37:55,209 --> 01:37:57,586
[Murmuring]

1525
01:37:57,669 --> 01:37:59,588
- Is it?
- Oh, wow. That's him!

1526
01:37:59,630 --> 01:38:03,425
Is that? That's the Hudson Hornet!
The Hudson Hornet's back!

1527
01:38:03,467 --> 01:38:06,094
[Bob] It appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

1528
01:38:06,178 --> 01:38:08,597
And look who he has for a crew chief!

1529
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:11,350
- Look, man. It's the Hudson Hornet!
- Whoa!

1530
01:38:11,433 --> 01:38:14,770
Well, dip me in axle grease
and call me Slick! It surely is.

1531
01:38:17,231 --> 01:38:19,316
[Crowd cheering]

1532
01:38:19,399 --> 01:38:21,401
[Bob] Wow, this is history
in the making.

1533
01:38:21,485 --> 01:38:24,404
Nobody has seen the racing legend
in over 50 years!

1534
01:38:24,446 --> 01:38:25,864
Hey, Doc!

1535
01:38:25,948 --> 01:38:30,118
Come look at this fellow on the radio.
He looks just like you.

1536
01:38:34,998 --> 01:38:38,794
- [Bob] McQueen passes on the inside!
- [Darrell] He's nearly a lap down.

1537
01:38:38,877 --> 01:38:41,797
[Bob] Can he catch up to them
with only 60 laps to go?

1538
01:38:41,839 --> 01:38:44,758
You're goin' great, kid.
Just keep your head on.

1539
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:46,426
Vai! Vai, vai!

1540
01:38:46,468 --> 01:38:49,388
Hey, shrimpie,
where did McQueen find you, huh?

1541
01:38:49,471 --> 01:38:52,891
Those round things are called tires,
and they go under the car!

1542
01:38:52,975 --> 01:38:53,976
[All laugh]

1543
01:38:54,059 --> 01:38:56,645
Con chi credi di parlare?
Ma, con chi stai parlando?

1544
01:38:56,728 --> 01:38:59,898
No! No, no! You'll have your chance.
You will have your chance.

1545
01:39:14,329 --> 01:39:17,165
Oh, kid's just tryin'
to be a hero, huh?

1546
01:39:18,709 --> 01:39:20,002
What do you think of this?

1547
01:39:20,043 --> 01:39:22,212
- [Tires squealing]
- Yeah, that's it, kid.

1548
01:39:25,507 --> 01:39:26,842
What?

1549
01:39:26,884 --> 01:39:28,677
Whoa! Git-R-done!

1550
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:34,725
- [Laughing] I taught him that. Ka-chow!
- Ah!

1551
01:39:34,808 --> 01:39:37,769
[Bob] What a move by McQueen!
He's caught up to the leaders.

1552
01:39:37,853 --> 01:39:39,688
Yeah. This is what it's all about.

1553
01:39:39,730 --> 01:39:42,900
A three-way battle for the lead,
with ten to go!

1554
01:39:46,528 --> 01:39:49,740
[Chortling]
Look at that boy go out there!

1555
01:39:55,454 --> 01:39:57,748
[Chick] Oh! [grunting]

1556
01:39:58,707 --> 01:40:00,250
No, you don't.

1557
01:40:01,376 --> 01:40:03,253
[Tire blows]

1558
01:40:03,337 --> 01:40:05,339
Doc, I'm flat! I'm flat!

1559
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:08,842
- Can you get back to the pits?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

1560
01:40:08,884 --> 01:40:12,221
Hey, got a yellow. Bring it in.
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1561
01:40:14,139 --> 01:40:16,266
[Mack] We gotta get him
back out there fast

1562
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:19,269
or we're gonna be a lap down,
and we'll never win this race!

1563
01:40:19,353 --> 01:40:21,522
Guido! It's time.

1564
01:40:25,776 --> 01:40:28,862
Hey, tiny,
you gonna clean his windshield?

1565
01:40:31,490 --> 01:40:33,992
[Air wrench whirring]

1566
01:40:37,996 --> 01:40:39,414
[Darrell] I don't believe it!

1567
01:40:39,498 --> 01:40:41,208
[Bob] That was
the fastest pit stop I've ever seen!

1568
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:43,836
[Darrell] It was a great stop,
but he's still gotta beat that pace car!

1569
01:40:43,919 --> 01:40:45,587
[Bob] It's gonna be close.

1570
01:40:47,256 --> 01:40:49,758
- Yeah, baby!
- [All hollering]

1571
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,176
[Darrell] He's back in!

1572
01:40:52,511 --> 01:40:53,512
Peet stop.

1573
01:40:54,930 --> 01:40:56,890
- Guido, you did it!
- Way to go, Guido!

1574
01:41:12,155 --> 01:41:15,242
[Bob] This is it. We're heading into
the final lap and McQueen

1575
01:41:15,284 --> 01:41:17,661
is right behind the leaders.
What a comeback!

1576
01:41:17,744 --> 01:41:21,248
[Darrell] A hundred and ninety-nine
laps! It all comes down to this!

1577
01:41:21,331 --> 01:41:22,624
This is it, kiddo.

1578
01:41:22,666 --> 01:41:25,169
You've got four turns left.
One at a time.

1579
01:41:25,252 --> 01:41:27,671
Drive it in deep and hope it sticks.

1580
01:41:27,754 --> 01:41:29,131
- Go!
- [Rewing]

1581
01:41:31,842 --> 01:41:32,968
We'll see about that!

1582
01:41:34,469 --> 01:41:36,054
[Bob] McQueen's going inside!

1583
01:41:39,016 --> 01:41:42,060
- Chick and King are loose!
- [Darrell] I think McQueen's out!

1584
01:41:52,738 --> 01:41:55,199
- McQueen saved it!
- [Bob] He's back on the track!

1585
01:41:55,616 --> 01:41:58,285
- Float like a Cadillac...
- Sting like a Beemer!

1586
01:41:59,328 --> 01:42:02,956
- Ka-chow! Ka-chow! Ka...
- [all cheer]

1587
01:42:04,541 --> 01:42:07,544
[Darrell] Lightning McQueen
is gonna win the Piston Cup!

1588
01:42:07,628 --> 01:42:09,713
Come on! You got it!
You got it, Stickers!

1589
01:42:11,215 --> 01:42:15,010
[Grunts] I am not comin' in
behind you again, old man.

1590
01:42:25,354 --> 01:42:27,272
- Oh, no!
- [Crowd gasps]

1591
01:42:36,532 --> 01:42:38,700
[Breaks screeching]

1592
01:42:41,161 --> 01:42:42,454
[Engine idling]

1593
01:42:45,791 --> 01:42:48,001
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1594
01:42:48,043 --> 01:42:51,797
I won, baby! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1595
01:42:53,090 --> 01:42:55,217
[Flo] What's he up to, Doc?

1596
01:43:03,559 --> 01:43:05,519
[Grunting, moaning]

1597
01:43:05,602 --> 01:43:06,979
What are you doin', kid?

1598
01:43:07,062 --> 01:43:10,274
I think The King
should finish his last race.

1599
01:43:13,443 --> 01:43:16,446
You just gave up the Piston Cup,
you know that?

1600
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:20,117
This grumpy old racecar I know
once told me somethin'.

1601
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,244
It's just an empty cup.

1602
01:43:24,371 --> 01:43:26,915
[Bob] Darrell, is pushing
on the last lap legal?

1603
01:43:26,999 --> 01:43:30,669
He's not really pushin' him. He's
just givin' him a little bump draft.

1604
01:43:30,752 --> 01:43:33,046
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1605
01:43:33,088 --> 01:43:35,799
Hey. What? What's goin' on?

1606
01:43:35,883 --> 01:43:38,135
- That's what I call racin'.
- [Sobbing]

1607
01:43:38,218 --> 01:43:39,678
[Laughing]

1608
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:44,683
[Crowd cheers wildly]

1609
01:43:54,109 --> 01:43:57,154
- Bravo il mio amico!
- Way to go, buddy!

1610
01:43:57,237 --> 01:43:59,823
There's a lotta love out there,
you know, man?

1611
01:43:59,907 --> 01:44:04,411
- Don't embarrass me, Fillmore.
- That's my hot rod.

1612
01:44:06,455 --> 01:44:09,917
Come on, baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

1613
01:44:09,958 --> 01:44:11,376
Ka-chicka! Ka-chicka!

1614
01:44:11,460 --> 01:44:14,421
Yeah!
Now, that's what I'm talkin' about!

1615
01:44:14,463 --> 01:44:17,591
Hey, how come the only one celebrating
is me, huh?

1616
01:44:17,674 --> 01:44:19,927
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

1617
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:23,597
Ow! Ow! Easy with the confetti.
What's goin' on?

1618
01:44:23,639 --> 01:44:26,975
Come on, snap some pictures.
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1619
01:44:27,017 --> 01:44:28,477
Say it with me. Ka-chicka!

1620
01:44:28,644 --> 01:44:30,187
- Boo!
- Boo!

1621
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:33,357
What's wrong with everybody?
Where's the happiness?

1622
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,526
Hey! This is the start of the Chick era!

1623
01:44:41,448 --> 01:44:43,951
- Thanks, Lightnin'.
- You're welcome.

1624
01:44:46,328 --> 01:44:48,789
- Way to go, King!
- You're still the car!

1625
01:44:48,830 --> 01:44:50,832
You're The King! Yeah!

1626
01:44:51,333 --> 01:44:53,627
[Crowd cheers]

1627
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:01,176
[Laughing and cheering]

1628
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:04,721
- You made us proud, kid!
- Congrats on the loss, me bucko!

1629
01:45:07,933 --> 01:45:10,561
You got a lotta stuff, kid.

1630
01:45:10,769 --> 01:45:12,437
Thanks, Doc.

1631
01:45:13,564 --> 01:45:14,898
Hey, Lightnin'.

1632
01:45:14,982 --> 01:45:17,651
How 'bout comin' over here
and talk to me a minute?

1633
01:45:18,527 --> 01:45:21,572
Son, that was some
real racin' out there.

1634
01:45:21,655 --> 01:45:24,408
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

1635
01:45:29,121 --> 01:45:30,581
But I didn't win.

1636
01:45:30,664 --> 01:45:34,334
Lightnin', there's a whole lot
more to racin' than just winnin'.

1637
01:45:34,376 --> 01:45:37,087
[Clank] He was so rusty,
when he drove down the street

1638
01:45:37,171 --> 01:45:41,341
- buzzards used to circle the car!
- [All laugh]

1639
01:45:41,383 --> 01:45:43,135
Thank you, Mr. Tex, but...

1640
01:45:43,218 --> 01:45:46,930
...but these Rust-eze guys over there
gave me my big break.

1641
01:45:48,473 --> 01:45:50,225
I'm gonna stick with them.

1642
01:45:50,267 --> 01:45:53,353
Well, I sure can respect that.

1643
01:45:53,395 --> 01:45:54,563
Still, you know,

1644
01:45:54,646 --> 01:45:58,525
if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just let me know.

1645
01:45:58,567 --> 01:46:01,111
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

1646
01:46:02,571 --> 01:46:05,574
Actually, there is one thing.

1647
01:46:06,283 --> 01:46:07,284
Whoo-hoo!

1648
01:46:07,284 --> 01:46:08,535
Whoo-hoo!

1649
01:46:08,577 --> 01:46:12,456
Hey, look at me!
I'm flyin', by golly!

1650
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,963
I'm happier than a tornado

01:46:23,592 --> 01:46:25,928
I think it's about-a time
we redecorate.

1652
01:46:29,056 --> 01:46:32,476
Hi. Lightning McQueen told me
this was the best place in the world

1653
01:46:32,559 --> 01:46:33,560
to get tires.

1654
01:46:33,602 --> 01:46:37,814
How 'bout setting me and my friends up
with three or four sets each?

1655
01:46:37,898 --> 01:46:43,111
Guido! There is a real
Michael Schumacher Ferrari in my store.

1656
01:46:43,153 --> 01:46:45,447
A real Ferrari!

1657
01:46:45,531 --> 01:46:47,658
Punch me, Guido.
Punch me in the face.

1658
01:46:47,741 --> 01:46:51,203
This is the most glorious day
of my life.

1659
01:46:52,496 --> 01:46:56,083
Wow. [Italian]
Spero che il tuo amico si riprenda.

1664
01:47:16,353 --> 01:47:18,647
Actually, I thought I'd stop
and stay awhile.

1665
01:47:18,730 --> 01:47:21,984
- I hear this place is back on the map.
- It is?

1666
01:47:22,067 --> 01:47:25,821
There's some rumor floating around
that some hotshot Piston Cup racecar

1667
01:47:25,904 --> 01:47:28,365
is setting up his big
racing headquarters here.

1668
01:47:28,448 --> 01:47:31,285
Really? Ah, well, there goes the town.

1669
01:47:31,326 --> 01:47:33,829
You know, I really missed you, Sally.

1670
01:47:33,912 --> 01:47:38,041
Well, I create feelings in others
they themselves don't understand and,

1671
01:47:38,125 --> 01:47:40,294
- blah, blah, blah.

So, Stickers, last one to Flo's buys?

1678
01:48:00,355 --> 01:48:03,066
I don't know.
Why don't we just take a drive?

1679
01:48:03,150 --> 01:48:05,736
Hmm... Nah.

1680
01:48:07,487 --> 01:48:09,698

Wow. Unbelievable.
That many wins in a single season.

He's the real deal, Junior.
The Hudson Hornet was my inspiration.

1689

Excuse me, son.
Is Doc Hudson here today?

1690
01:49:40,205 --> 01:49:44,001
Sorry, Mrs. The King, I think Doc
went out for a drive or somethin'.
