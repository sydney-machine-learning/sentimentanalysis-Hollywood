1
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:17,079
Hey, watch it.

2
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,938
Oh, come on.

3
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:44,244
Hey, Mike!

4
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:47,046
-Hey, Larry.
-How you doing?

5
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:48,415
Have you seen Nicky?

6
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:51,150
I'm pretty sure he went with Erica.
It was half day today.

7
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:53,521
Parent Career Day.

8
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:01,894
-Hey.
-Hey. Come on in.

9
00:04:03,072 --> 00:04:06,099
-You all right?
-Yeah, yeah.

10
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:08,567
Why didn't anybody tell me
it was Career Day?

11
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:11,010
What do you mean?
Nicky said he was gonna tell you.

12
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,977
Oh, okay, I guess he forgot.

13
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,486
There he is. How are you, Larry?

14
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:19,682
Good. How are you doing, Don?

15
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,027
Good.

16
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,860
Can you believe this weather?

17
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,833
Chilly, right? Chilly, chilly,
Chilly Willy the penguin.

18
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:36,373
Leave me alone. Hey, why don't I go tell
the little corncob you're here.

19
00:04:36,545 --> 00:04:39,742
Great. Great, that's great. Yeah, thanks.

20
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:44,549
Wow, your fiance really manages
to squeeze a lot onto that belt.

21
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,052
-Stop it.
-What?

22
00:04:46,223 --> 00:04:49,158
What? No, it's like he's...

23
00:04:49,326 --> 00:04:50,988
...the Batman of stockbrokers.

24
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:54,131
-Bond trader.
-Bond trader. Sorry.

25
00:04:54,298 --> 00:04:58,668
Hey, how's it going with that virtual-reality
driving range that you wanted to open?

26
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:01,898
Getting there, still waiting for
the technology to catch up.

27
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:04,304
It's not easy,
there are a lot of moving parts.

28
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:08,912
Hey, do you think Nick
would like Queens?

29
00:05:09,082 --> 00:05:12,575
Oh, no, Larry. You didn't get evicted again,
did you?

30
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:14,849
I didn't...

31
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:18,015
...get evicted. I didn't get evicted, no.
I mean, I didn't....

32
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,219
-No, I didn't get evicted yet. It's like--
-Larry, listen to me.

33
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:23,262
I don't know how much more
Nicky can take.

34
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:26,061
Every couple months, it's a new career,
a new apartment.

35
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:29,501
If it wasn't for Nicky, I wouldn't
say anything, I would stay out of it.

36
00:05:29,672 --> 00:05:32,369
It's just, it's too much instability.
It's not good for him.

37
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:35,067
I'm trying to figure things out
right now, okay?

38
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:41,341
You know...

39
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:45,015
...I don't think that Nicky
should stay with you.

40
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:48,753
-What?
-Just until you get really settled.

41
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,322
Hey, Dad.

42
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:54,559
-Hey, ready to carve it up?
-Cool.

43
00:05:59,374 --> 00:06:03,038
All right, good!
Take it, Nicky! Break away!

44
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,775
-What are you doing?
-Hey, Nicky! Are you all right?

45
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:14,316
-You okay?
-I'm fine. Would you get off the ice?

46
00:06:14,492 --> 00:06:16,926
Listen. Their left defenseman
is a very weak skater.

47
00:06:17,095 --> 00:06:19,928
So you go left side, you got
a clear shot at the goal. Okay?

48
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:22,259
-Cool, thanks.
-All right, man.

49
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:28,372
We're good here. We're good.
All right. As you were, skaters.

50
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:30,672
Game on!

51
00:06:31,845 --> 00:06:33,403
I'm good.

52
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,845
I'm telling you,
you tore it up out there today.

53
00:06:36,017 --> 00:06:38,508
Thinking the NHL is a serious possibility.

54
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:42,021
I don't really wanna be
a hockey player anymore.

55
00:06:43,692 --> 00:06:47,289
-All right. What do you wanna be?
-A bond trader.

56
00:06:48,164 --> 00:06:49,393
A bond trader?

57
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:53,502
Yeah, it's what Don does.
He took me to his office last week.

58
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:55,635
That's cool.

59
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:58,470
So you wanna dress up
in a monkey suit and tie every day?

60
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:01,510
Like an automaton robot?

61
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:05,382
Trust me, you can't play hockey
in a cubicle. Kind of awkward.

62
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:07,879
Well, he's got a pretty big office.

63
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,955
That's not the point.
Come on, you love hockey.

64
00:07:11,124 --> 00:07:14,253
I still like it,
but bond trading's my fallback.

65
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:16,191
Your fallback?

66
00:07:16,363 --> 00:07:19,129
Wait a minute. You're too young
to have a fallback, okay?

67
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:22,236
And also, where did you ever
even hear that word?

68
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:25,464
Mom was talking to Don
about all your different schemes.

69
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,005
She called them schemes?

70
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:30,077
She said it was time
you found a fallback.

71
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:35,748
Are you really moving again?

72
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:41,120
I don't know. We'll see. I mean...

73
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,726
...there's some pretty cool places
out in Queens.

74
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:46,489
-Yeah.
-Hey.

75
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:49,361
Hey, Nicky, look at me.

76
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,033
Look at me, man.
I wanna tell you something.

77
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:55,436
I know that things have been kind of
up and down for me lately...

78
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,372
...and that's been hard for you.

79
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:00,475
But I really feel like my moment's coming
and when it does...

80
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:03,641
...everything's just gonna come together,
you know?

81
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:05,081
What if you're wrong...

82
00:08:05,254 --> 00:08:08,849
...and you're just an ordinary guy
who should get a job?

83
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:16,862
All right, well....

84
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:22,272
You know what,
we'll figure it out, okay?

85
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:26,406
All right? Come on,
let's get you back to Mom's.

86
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:37,152
Mr. Daley, I can honestly say,
in 43 years at this agency...

87
00:08:37,324 --> 00:08:40,054
...I've never seen a resume
quite like yours.

88
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:42,357
All right.

89
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:46,130
That wasn't a compliment.

90
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:48,599
It says here you were the CEO...

91
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,296
...of Snaptime lndustries.

92
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:52,999
Care to elaborate on that?

93
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:58,113
Sure. Well, that was the umbrella
corporation for my invention, the Snapper.

94
00:08:58,281 --> 00:09:01,808
You know, you snap, the lights come on.
Snap, they come off.

95
00:09:01,986 --> 00:09:04,614
Didn't they already make that?

96
00:09:05,891 --> 00:09:09,554
No, no, that's the Clapper,
which, obviously...

97
00:09:09,728 --> 00:09:11,356
...stole a bit of our thunder.

98
00:09:11,531 --> 00:09:14,932
Personally, I don't really see
what the big difference is, I mean:

99
00:09:15,101 --> 00:09:17,501
You know, whatever, but...

100
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,973
...apparently there is a significant portion
of the population that has trouble actually...

101
00:09:23,144 --> 00:09:26,137
-...snapping.
-Clapping's easier.

102
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:29,074
Debatable.

103
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:31,247
I can't help you.

104
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:33,215
Debbie?

105
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:35,152
Can I call you Debbie? Because...

106
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,622
...I felt a connection
when I entered this office...

107
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:40,160
...and I don't know,
I feel like you did too.

108
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:43,259
I didn't feel a connection.

109
00:09:45,937 --> 00:09:47,234
Look.

110
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:52,105
I need a job tomorrow, okay?

111
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:54,143
If I don't have one....

112
00:09:54,848 --> 00:09:57,112
Well, I just need it, okay?

113
00:09:57,384 --> 00:09:59,649
Well, I don't know.

114
00:09:59,921 --> 00:10:02,219
I might have one thing.

115
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:06,889
They've turned down everyone
I've sent over there, but--

116
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:08,528
Great.

117
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:10,728
--who knows?

118
00:10:12,434 --> 00:10:13,731
You might get lucky.

119
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:50,071
-Excuse me. Hi.
-Hi.

120
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:54,910
I'm Larry Daley. I've got a job interview
with Cecil Fredricks.

121
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:58,512
-Right. He should still be in his office.
-Great.

122
00:10:58,688 --> 00:11:02,147
-I'm Rebecca Hutman. I'm a docent here.
-Hi.

123
00:11:02,326 --> 00:11:05,591
-Let me point you in the right direction.
-Great.

124
00:11:07,898 --> 00:11:09,161
Teddy Roosevelt, right?

125
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:12,997
-Yes, a great visionary.
-Yes, definitely.

126
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:15,230
He was our 4th president, right?

127
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,638
-Twenty-sixth.
-Twenty-sixth.

128
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,780
Please don't touch the exhibits!
I mean....

129
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:22,245
Riffraff.

130
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:25,710
Miss Hutman.
I cannot tolerate this type of chaos.

131
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:29,084
I mean, this is a museum, not a....

132
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:32,390
Do you know what "museum" means?

133
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:37,060
It doesn't mean,
"Daddy, it's a big Tyrannosaurus thing.

134
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:39,861
Can I touch its leg? " No!

135
00:11:40,137 --> 00:11:41,968
Work it out, please.

136
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:44,903
-Will do, sir.
-Thank you.

137
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,537
Dr. McPhee, the museum director.

138
00:11:47,712 --> 00:11:49,510
Seems like a fun guy.

139
00:11:49,682 --> 00:11:52,707
Control your young, please. Can we?

140
00:12:04,397 --> 00:12:07,595
Hello? Just kidding.

141
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:11,398
Hi. I'm Larry Daley.
Are you Mr. Fredricks?

142
00:12:11,572 --> 00:12:13,734
Mr. Fredricks was my father.

143
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:17,242
I am Cecil. Good to meet you, Larry.
Nice firm handshake.

144
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:20,940
I like that. Tells a lot about a man.
Come on in.

145
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:28,190
Let's talk turkey here.

146
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:33,724
The museum is losing money,
hand over fist.

147
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,199
I guess kids today don't care about
wax figures or stuffed animals.

148
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:42,369
So they're downsizing,
which is code for firing...

149
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,510
...myself and the other two night guards.

150
00:12:44,878 --> 00:12:46,971
They want to replace us
with one new guard.

151
00:12:47,147 --> 00:12:50,675
-Oh, sorry.
-Well, what are you gonna do?

152
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:54,414
I'd like you to meet
my two colleagues here.

153
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:57,024
Reginald? Gus?

154
00:12:57,192 --> 00:12:59,786
Where is he? I'll beat him with my fist!

155
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:05,260
Gus, this is Larry Daley, the kid who
wants to be the new night guard.

156
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:07,925
Night guard?

157
00:13:08,105 --> 00:13:11,268
No, the lady at the agency said
this was a museum position.

158
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:14,571
Most important position
in the museum, Larry.

159
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:16,543
He looks like a weirdie.

160
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:19,715
Wonderful guard, terrible people skills.

161
00:13:19,885 --> 00:13:23,219
Now, listen, lunch box.
Don't try anything funny.

162
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:26,587
I once went nine rounds
with John L. Sullivan.

163
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:29,557
You never fought John L. Sullivan
in your life.

164
00:13:29,731 --> 00:13:32,325
Gentlemen, we have
a job candidate here.

165
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,025
He's got an excellent resume,
a winning attitude...

166
00:13:35,203 --> 00:13:37,570
...and I say let's give him a shot.
What do you say?

167
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,801
Hang on a sec. I think I might wanna
have a little time just to think it over.

168
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:45,243
Do you want the job or not, snack shack?

169
00:13:47,617 --> 00:13:51,520
-No, no, I want the job--
-Welcome to the night guards, Larry.

170
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,516
Larry, meet me up on the second floor.

171
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:58,459
I'll slip into my orthopedics and
give you a little tour. Arthritic knees.

172
00:13:58,864 --> 00:14:02,630
Not fun getting old, my friend. Go on.

173
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:10,976
You really think he's the one?

174
00:14:12,446 --> 00:14:14,142
Oh, yes.

175
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:16,250
He's the one.

176
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:33,426
Gotta keep it moving, Larry.
I'm pretty spry for an old man.

177
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:36,768
This is the Diorama Room.

178
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,932
Oh, yeah.

179
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:44,147
I remember these little guys. Cute.

180
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,420
Cecil!

181
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,352
Hey, Cecil!

182
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:09,034
-Did I get you good?
-Yeah.

183
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:11,545
You got me.

184
00:15:14,786 --> 00:15:20,019
Seriously, though, no fooling around
in here. This stuff is really old.

185
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:25,220
All right, then. As you can see,
it's pretty quiet in here these days.

186
00:15:25,597 --> 00:15:29,126
On the left there is your Attila the Hun.

187
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,634
And here we have our Easter lsland head.

188
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:37,006
Hey, Cecil.

189
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:43,576
And this, of course,
is the Hall of African Mammals.

190
00:15:43,752 --> 00:15:46,118
Ah, yes.

191
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:50,548
Monkeys. I love monkeys.

192
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:53,724
-Yeah.
-Guy's cute.

193
00:15:53,898 --> 00:15:57,698
Yeah, we call him Dexter.
He's quite a little...

194
00:15:57,868 --> 00:16:00,598
...ball of fun, aren't you, Dexter?

195
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:05,005
Moving on.

196
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:11,981
And, finally, this is the temple
of the Pharaoh Ahkmenrah.

197
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:18,954
And in that tomb right down there,
the pharaoh himself.

198
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:20,424
Neat.

199
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:22,790
And hanging on the wall behind him...

200
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:28,403
...was his most prized possession,
the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

201
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:32,139
Twenty-four-carat gold.
It's worth a fortune.

202
00:16:32,309 --> 00:16:34,038
Very cool.

203
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:35,839
It is indeed, Larry.

204
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,848
Very cool.

205
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:47,085
All right. Report here at 5 tomorrow.
We'll walk you through your duties.

206
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:49,125
Okay, 5. I'll be here.

207
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:51,195
Moving on.

208
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,761
Hey, it's me. So I got a job.

209
00:16:55,936 --> 00:16:58,268
Larry, that's great. What is it?

210
00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:01,603
It's a job...

211
00:17:01,777 --> 00:17:05,042
...at the Museum of Natural History.

212
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:07,841
Yeah, so you can tell Nicky
that we won't be moving.

213
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:09,245
Larry, this is good news.

214
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,081
Yeah, no, definitely.
So I'll see you tomorrow?

215
00:17:12,255 --> 00:17:14,723
-Okay.
-Okay, bye.

216
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,468
Larry?

217
00:17:25,871 --> 00:17:28,601
Your keys. Your torch.

218
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:31,572
-Right.
-You'll wanna strap those to your belt.

219
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:34,009
It can get a little spooky
around here at night...

220
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,672
...so you might wanna
put a few lights on.

221
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:40,746
All right, flashlight, keys.
What am I for--?

222
00:17:43,424 --> 00:17:45,256
The instruction manual.

223
00:17:45,427 --> 00:17:46,689
Instructions.

224
00:17:46,862 --> 00:17:50,093
You start with one, two, three....

225
00:17:50,265 --> 00:17:51,597
Four?

226
00:17:51,768 --> 00:17:53,565
Are you cracking wise?

227
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:56,638
I ought to punch you
in the nose, hopscotch.

228
00:17:56,806 --> 00:17:59,799
Leave him alone, Gus.
You got it covered, right, Larry?

229
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:02,104
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

230
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:04,679
-You better get it!
-Gus.

231
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:08,343
Larry, do them in order,
do them all and do them quick.

232
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,720
And the most important thing of all
to remember: Don't let anything in or out.

233
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,121
Out?

234
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,990
Good luck, son.

235
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:20,065
-Night, Gus.
-Young buck. Cracking wise.

236
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:21,861
Moving on.

237
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,334
Hello?

238
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:00,342
Hello!

239
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:02,243
Check!

240
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:05,078
Check.

241
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:08,779
I am Larry.

242
00:19:08,957 --> 00:19:12,951
Check! Larry! Larry.

243
00:19:18,302 --> 00:19:20,736
Monday! Monday! Monday!

244
00:19:20,904 --> 00:19:23,465
Monster Truck Rally.

245
00:20:44,434 --> 00:20:46,232
Cecil?

246
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:52,168
Okay, very funny, Cecil!

247
00:20:53,612 --> 00:20:56,605
What is this, like a
David Copperfield thing?

248
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:07,057
This is weird.

249
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:17,434
Cecil?

250
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:11,794
Come on. Revolve. Revolve!

251
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:27,653
-Name, please?
-Cecil...

252
00:22:28,256 --> 00:22:31,657
-...Fredricks!
-One moment. Connecting.

253
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:33,885
-Hello.
-Cecil! It's Larry Daley!

254
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,054
Larry. Yes, how can I help you?

255
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,859
The dinosaur-- The dinosaur is alive!

256
00:22:39,034 --> 00:22:41,161
I'm having a little trouble
hearing you, friend.

257
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:42,633
Tequila.

258
00:22:42,806 --> 00:22:44,603
The dinosaur's alive!

259
00:22:44,774 --> 00:22:46,207
What do I do?
Tell me what to do!

260
00:22:46,376 --> 00:22:49,539
Read the instructions.
It explains everything.

261
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:53,244
Okay, I got them!

262
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:56,311
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Wait! What--?

263
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:07,559
What bone?

264
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:07,164
Fetch?

265
00:24:10,707 --> 00:24:12,470
Play fetch?

266
00:24:35,536 --> 00:24:37,367
No way.

267
00:24:48,351 --> 00:24:49,875
-Dum-dum.
-Yes?

268
00:24:50,054 --> 00:24:53,080
-You give me gum-gum.
-I give you gum-gum?

269
00:24:53,257 --> 00:24:56,249
You new dum-dum.
You give me gum-gum.

270
00:24:57,728 --> 00:25:00,095
Okay, you know what?
I have no gum-gum. Sorry.

271
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,130
And my name isn't dum-dum,
my name's Larry.

272
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,929
No, your name dum-dum.

273
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:09,207
Oh, you in trouble, dum-dum.

274
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,209
You'd better run-run
from Attila the Hun-Hun.

275
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:18,046
See you later, dum-dum.

276
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,153
What is happening?

277
00:26:36,076 --> 00:26:37,373
Hey.

278
00:26:38,612 --> 00:26:40,136
How you doing?

279
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:44,910
Are you...?

280
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:46,983
You're...

281
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,017
..."Sakagahwahwaya"?

282
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:51,660
You're "Sakagawaya"?

283
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:54,659
Oh, Sakagawea. You're Sakagawea?

284
00:26:55,264 --> 00:26:57,927
The glass. I can't...

285
00:26:58,101 --> 00:26:59,660
...hear you.

286
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,397
You can't...? You can't hear me?

287
00:27:03,575 --> 00:27:06,043
Excuse me.
"Who assisted the Lewis and Clark--"

288
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:09,542
Right, so that's Lewis and Clark
and you're.... Right.

289
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:11,842
You seem-- I'm Larry.

290
00:27:12,551 --> 00:27:15,918
What's going on? What's--?
Do you know what's going on here?

291
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:19,849
Huns. I gotta--

292
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:07,678
Hey. Hi.

293
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:10,250
Tin Man. Hey. Hi. How you doing?

294
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:13,582
I'm new. It says I'm supposed to
lock up the lions or they'll eat me.

295
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:18,289
You're Galileo? No?

296
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:41,620
Okay....

297
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:43,618
Hey, I'm the....

298
00:28:45,326 --> 00:28:49,730
Hi. I'm the new guy
and I'm just locking up, so....

299
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:55,159
If it's cool with you
I'm just gonna get my paperwork...

300
00:28:56,706 --> 00:28:58,503
...and be out of your hair, okay?

301
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,540
"Double-check your belt.
The monkey probably stole your keys."

302
00:29:58,711 --> 00:30:00,407
Monkey.

303
00:30:03,216 --> 00:30:07,152
Hey. Hey there. Hi.
What's your name? Your name is....

304
00:30:07,921 --> 00:30:10,152
No, no, no. Come back. Come back.

305
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:12,294
Dewey? Is that your name, Dewey?

306
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,420
No, no, no. What's--? Dewey?
Dexter? Dexter. Dexter, right?

307
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:18,794
Hey, Dexter,
you wanna give me those keys?

308
00:30:18,968 --> 00:30:21,198
I just want to lock up.

309
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,498
Yes. Oh, good. Come to Papa.

310
00:30:23,673 --> 00:30:28,338
Oh, thank you. Can I have those keys?
Oh, good. What a good boy.

311
00:30:28,512 --> 00:30:30,446
That's okay. Oh, thank you.

312
00:30:30,615 --> 00:30:34,450
Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.
Thank you very, very much.

313
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,343
Bad monkey. Stop that.

314
00:30:58,514 --> 00:31:01,608
That's not right. Are you done?

315
00:31:02,852 --> 00:31:05,447
Do you have an issue with me?
Do you have an issue with me?

316
00:31:05,622 --> 00:31:08,682
Because if I have a problem with somebody,
I don't pee on them, okay?

317
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:12,159
And also-- Let me tell you something.
These keys?

318
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:15,462
Hey. Dexter, that's not funny.
Give it back.

319
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:17,465
Dexter. Give--

320
00:31:19,506 --> 00:31:23,670
Don't. I know what you're thinking.
Don't do it. Not a good idea.

321
00:31:23,843 --> 00:31:25,401
Not-- Dexter, I need those.

322
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:29,308
Don't encourage him. You think
you're funny for your friends, huh?

323
00:31:29,482 --> 00:31:32,544
You three guys-- What, he's the ringleader,
you're the audience?

324
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,415
Yeah, no. Don't do it, okay?

325
00:31:34,588 --> 00:31:36,216
Lookit-- You!

326
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:51,239
Oh, this is not happening.

327
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:02,054
Oh, man.

328
00:32:28,284 --> 00:32:30,048
What are you guys doing?

329
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:32,616
I can't feel my lip.

330
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:35,653
Oh, shit.

331
00:32:39,498 --> 00:32:41,056
Man.

332
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,451
Hey. Hey.

333
00:33:09,132 --> 00:33:11,157
Hey, stop that.

334
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,971
Hog-tie him, boys.

335
00:33:19,177 --> 00:33:23,205
-Get him, that big old Bocephus of a man.
-Hey, what are you doing?

336
00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:25,714
Cinch him up good.
You ain't so big now, are you?

337
00:33:25,884 --> 00:33:27,876
Hey. Hey, stop that.

338
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:34,218
Every night, year after year...

339
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:37,888
...one of you guards
locks us up in these boxes.

340
00:33:38,065 --> 00:33:41,297
Well, I hereby say, sir, enough!

341
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:45,201
Fire up the iron horse, boys.

342
00:33:53,317 --> 00:33:55,980
-Hey, blondie?
-Name's Jedediah.

343
00:33:56,154 --> 00:33:58,144
All right, Jedediah. Stop the train, please.

344
00:33:58,323 --> 00:34:01,918
-That's a big no-can-do, Cracker Jack.
-What's going on here, huh?

345
00:34:02,093 --> 00:34:04,323
-Somebody's gotta pay.
-Pay for what?

346
00:34:04,496 --> 00:34:09,332
I don't know. Just pay. Now, stop whining
and just take it like a man.

347
00:34:13,907 --> 00:34:15,535
Seriously, stop the train.

348
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,543
-All right, stop the train.
-Thank you.

349
00:34:18,746 --> 00:34:20,771
Now full speed ahead and ram him!

350
00:34:20,948 --> 00:34:22,746
Split his head like a watermelon!

351
00:34:24,953 --> 00:34:26,615
For crying out loud.

352
00:34:26,789 --> 00:34:28,279
All right, that's enough.

353
00:34:28,458 --> 00:34:31,256
We got a breach.

354
00:34:39,337 --> 00:34:44,331
I got him. I got him. I got him, guys.
I got him--

355
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,538
-Oh, my....
-Prepare the catapults.

356
00:34:51,718 --> 00:34:56,280
Octavius, hold on. This ain't your fight.
This here giant's on our land.

357
00:34:56,456 --> 00:34:58,948
Hey, little guy. Jed? Yeah.

358
00:34:59,126 --> 00:35:02,062
Sorry, look. I just-- I'm not a giant.
I'm just an average-sized--

359
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,926
Don't talk down to me.

360
00:35:04,098 --> 00:35:07,125
I'm not a giant, guys. All right?
You guys are really little.

361
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:11,601
We may be small,
but our hearts are large...

362
00:35:11,774 --> 00:35:13,766
...metaphorically speaking.

363
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:16,277
Don't take that wrong.
I'm saying you're miniatures.

364
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,347
Silence! The Roman Empire
knows no boundaries.

365
00:35:19,516 --> 00:35:22,112
-Don't you do it, son.
-Do what?

366
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,685
-Octavius.
-Don't do what?

367
00:35:23,854 --> 00:35:27,313
-Unleash hell!
-Don't--

368
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:39,867
Climb aboard, boy.

369
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,134
Take the hand, son.

370
00:35:44,379 --> 00:35:45,710
Onboard.

371
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:51,218
That's right. You better run, boy.
You hear Jedediah?

372
00:35:51,387 --> 00:35:55,848
That mustachioed horseman ain't always
gonna be there to protect you, you hear me?

373
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,387
-Thank you.
-Not at all.

374
00:36:00,565 --> 00:36:02,430
Theodore Roosevelt,
26th president...

375
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,966
...of these United States of America
at your service.

376
00:36:05,403 --> 00:36:10,034
Okay. I'm Larry Daley,
the new night guard.

377
00:36:12,846 --> 00:36:16,043
Pleasure to me you, Lawrence Daley.
You'll have to excuse me, though.

378
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,747
The hunt is afoot.

379
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,586
Hunt's afoot.

380
00:36:22,323 --> 00:36:25,656
Excuse me, Mr. President.
Could I ask you something?

381
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:27,886
-Yes, but just one question.
-All right.

382
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:31,260
Okay, why? Is it just some, like,
three-wishes kind of deal, or--?

383
00:36:33,036 --> 00:36:36,302
Not at all. Self-reliance
is the key to a vigorous life.

384
00:36:36,473 --> 00:36:40,670
A man must look inward to find
his own answers. How can I be of help?

385
00:36:40,844 --> 00:36:44,371
I don't really know how to put this,
and please don't take it the wrong way...

386
00:36:44,648 --> 00:36:48,107
...but isn't everything in this museum
supposed to be, you know...

387
00:36:48,286 --> 00:36:49,844
-...dead?
-Dead?

388
00:36:51,057 --> 00:36:53,856
-Yeah.
-Follow me.

389
00:36:56,763 --> 00:36:58,320
Yell all you want, pharaoh.

390
00:36:58,498 --> 00:37:02,458
You've been in there 54 years.
You're not getting out tonight.

391
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,534
There's the source of all this commotion.

392
00:37:05,706 --> 00:37:08,937
The Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

393
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,707
Arrived here in 1952
from the Nile expedition.

394
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:20,086
On that night,
everything in this museum came to life.

395
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,748
And every night since.

396
00:37:27,265 --> 00:37:30,701
So everything in the museum
comes to life every night?

397
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:32,360
Exactly.

398
00:37:32,904 --> 00:37:35,567
And I'm supposed to do what?

399
00:37:35,741 --> 00:37:40,839
You're the night watchman, Lawrence.
A venerable position in this institution.

400
00:37:42,749 --> 00:37:45,913
-Come on, lad.
-All right. Okay. This is impossible.

401
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,919
Nothing's impossible.
If it can be dreamed, it can be done.

402
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:52,082
Hence the 20-foot jackal staring at you.
Don't make eye contact.

403
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:55,628
Your job is to make sure that everyone
stays inside the museum...

404
00:37:55,798 --> 00:37:58,426
...because if the sun rises
and anyone's on the outside...

405
00:37:58,602 --> 00:38:00,661
...we turn to dust.

406
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,604
-You turn to dust?
-Dust.

407
00:38:03,773 --> 00:38:05,537
-Really?
-Really.

408
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:09,145
Now, it's almost dawn.
I shall help you restore order tonight.

409
00:38:09,313 --> 00:38:12,875
But mark my words, it's the last time
I shall ever do so. Is that clear?

410
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:17,485
Yeah. I mean-- I mean, I guess. I don't....

411
00:38:17,657 --> 00:38:20,626
Stop babbling, boy! Yes or no?

412
00:38:20,794 --> 00:38:22,455
-Yes.
-Good.

413
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,620
Let's ride.

414
00:38:34,843 --> 00:38:38,177
All right. So the Hall of Reptiles is secure.

415
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,489
What are you looking at?

416
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:53,228
I'm tracking, dear boy.

417
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:57,232
Man's got to track.
Welcome to the family, Lawrence.

418
00:38:58,204 --> 00:39:00,263
See you tomorrow night.

419
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:03,204
Actually, I gotta be honest.
I don't think I'm coming back.

420
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:05,640
What? You've only just begun.

421
00:39:05,812 --> 00:39:08,247
Yeah, well, this is not exactly what l--

422
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:09,610
-Lawrence?
-Yeah?

423
00:39:09,784 --> 00:39:11,911
What did you do
before you took this post?

424
00:39:12,086 --> 00:39:16,183
Well, I've done a lot of different things.
I invented this thing called the Snapper.

425
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:17,951
Did you give up on that as well?

426
00:39:18,127 --> 00:39:21,358
No, I just hit a few roadblocks.
You might have heard of The Clapper?

427
00:39:21,531 --> 00:39:22,725
-Lawrence.
-Yes, sir?

428
00:39:22,899 --> 00:39:28,338
Some men are born great.
Others have greatness thrust upon them.

429
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,539
For you, this is that very moment.

430
00:39:59,608 --> 00:40:01,906
Bully. Got you, boy.

431
00:40:02,077 --> 00:40:03,511
Yeah. You got me.

432
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:09,684
Say hello to your little friend.

433
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:13,185
-What are you doing?
-Put me down.

434
00:40:13,357 --> 00:40:15,519
I don't like to be manhandled.

435
00:40:15,694 --> 00:40:18,891
-Just calm down, Jed.
-lt doesn't feel good.

436
00:40:19,064 --> 00:40:22,660
-lt makes me feel small and powerless.
-You done?

437
00:40:22,835 --> 00:40:27,296
I'm gonna shoot you in your dang eye.
In your dadgum eye.

438
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:30,341
Yeah, keep shooting.
Nothing's gonna happen.

439
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:32,980
Now you know my shame.

440
00:40:33,148 --> 00:40:38,644
Jedediah's impotent rage.
His guns don't fire. Take me away.

441
00:40:39,255 --> 00:40:41,382
This ain't over.
You ain't seen the last of me.

442
00:40:41,557 --> 00:40:43,617
I don't wanna hear it, okay?

443
00:40:43,793 --> 00:40:45,352
Duck!

444
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:51,194
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.

445
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:52,859
This is not worth 1 1.50 an hour.

446
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:57,235
Look, the giant's scared.
There's a bigger giant running around.

447
00:41:34,252 --> 00:41:36,015
Hello.

448
00:41:36,187 --> 00:41:37,745
Larry?

449
00:41:39,691 --> 00:41:41,158
Larry?

450
00:41:46,466 --> 00:41:49,799
Oh, don't do that.
We're too old for surprises.

451
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:52,939
Really? I thought you liked surprises.
Like how you surprised me...

452
00:41:53,107 --> 00:41:56,008
...with the fact everything in
the museum comes to life at night.

453
00:41:56,177 --> 00:41:57,644
That little sweetheart.

454
00:41:57,813 --> 00:42:00,372
We wanted to tell you.
You never would have believed us.

455
00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:02,710
-You have any idea what I've been through?
-What?

456
00:42:02,885 --> 00:42:07,118
-You have any idea what I've been through?
-Keep a lid on it, butterscotch.

457
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,885
I don't know if what happened last night
was real, but I didn't sign up for this.

458
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:15,088
I just need a regular job that
is not life-threatening and pays my bills.

459
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:18,964
So thank you very much
and I left my uniform in the office...

460
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:21,503
-...and I will be seeing you.
-Larry!

461
00:42:27,413 --> 00:42:29,881
-Dad?
-Hey.

462
00:42:30,049 --> 00:42:32,348
Hey, buddy.
What are you guys doing here?

463
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:36,353
Oh, Erica had to be in court early,
so I'm taking Mr. Big Stuff here to school.

464
00:42:36,523 --> 00:42:38,821
But he wanted to swing by,
see you in the new job.

465
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:42,288
It's so awesome
that you're working here.

466
00:42:43,064 --> 00:42:45,556
Hey, Niko, you wanna take
a little look-a-doo inside?

467
00:42:45,733 --> 00:42:47,702
Maybe your dad will give you a VlP tour.

468
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,305
You know what?
We're pretty slammed this morning.

469
00:42:50,474 --> 00:42:55,002
Yeah, but Nicky, I promise,
I'll show you around soon, okay? Deal?

470
00:42:55,178 --> 00:42:56,839
-Deal.
-All right.

471
00:42:57,013 --> 00:42:59,005
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

472
00:42:59,183 --> 00:43:00,844
-Love you.
-Love you too, buddy.

473
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:02,816
Bye, now. All right.

474
00:43:32,722 --> 00:43:34,350
Hey, Larry.

475
00:43:34,525 --> 00:43:36,993
So I was thinking
maybe I'll give it one more night.

476
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,151
I'm glad you came around.
Welcome back.

477
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,425
You. New night guard, here, now.

478
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:52,805
-What's up?
-"What's up? "

479
00:43:52,979 --> 00:43:56,506
Oh, well, take a walk with me
and I'll show you, Mr. "What's up? "

480
00:43:56,684 --> 00:43:58,116
Come on.

481
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:04,251
So would you kindly do me the favor
of explaining this?

482
00:44:07,964 --> 00:44:10,558
Okay. I'm guessing--

483
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:15,397
And I'm just spitballing here,
but looks like that Roman dude got cocky...

484
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:17,403
...and climbed over into the Wild West.

485
00:44:17,575 --> 00:44:20,703
And the cowboy knows Roman dude
wants to take over his territory...

486
00:44:20,879 --> 00:44:23,370
...so he rounded up a posse
and put him in the stockade.

487
00:44:25,517 --> 00:44:27,816
"Let's all laugh at me,
the comedy night guard."

488
00:44:28,254 --> 00:44:30,779
"No" is the answer.

489
00:44:30,957 --> 00:44:34,415
Sarcasm back at you,
with your humor box.

490
00:44:35,227 --> 00:44:37,128
I wasn't laughing. Pretending to laugh...

491
00:44:37,297 --> 00:44:40,734
...if that's what you want,
some sort of battle of humor.

492
00:44:40,902 --> 00:44:42,334
Do you?

493
00:44:43,871 --> 00:44:45,304
No.

494
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,634
I don't want--
No, I don't want a battle of humor.

495
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,746
No, you don't,
because it would be a bloodbath.

496
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:54,340
Nothing funny about Little Bighorn.

497
00:44:57,053 --> 00:45:01,320
No. I find it about as funny
as a "fancist."

498
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:07,057
It's not funny. Okay? And I will not
stand for this type of blatant....

499
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,026
If I'm not clear, tell me.

500
00:45:13,438 --> 00:45:14,770
Am I clear?

501
00:45:15,675 --> 00:45:17,438
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

502
00:45:21,582 --> 00:45:22,914
Hey, Cecil?

503
00:45:24,185 --> 00:45:26,949
You got an extra copy
of that instruction manual?

504
00:45:27,122 --> 00:45:31,219
Oh, no. I'm afraid not, Larry.
Listen, I'll tell you what you do.

505
00:45:31,394 --> 00:45:33,954
Read some books.
Brush up on your history.

506
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,395
Helped me a lot when I first started out.

507
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:41,869
This museum was originally dedicated
to that man on the horse up there...

508
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,563
...President Theodore Roosevelt.

509
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,802
He absolutely loved history and believed
that the more you know about the past...

510
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:50,881
...the better prepared you are
for the future.

511
00:45:52,384 --> 00:45:55,980
Okay, kids. Who can tell me
what this room's called?

512
00:45:56,156 --> 00:45:58,556
Very good. The Hall of African Mammals.

513
00:45:58,725 --> 00:46:01,558
Right here we have the king of the jungle,
the lion.

514
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:06,259
Up ahead is one of my favorite creatures
in the whole museum, the capuchin monkey.

515
00:46:06,434 --> 00:46:11,395
A highly intelligent primate
known for its loving and generous nature.

516
00:46:15,344 --> 00:46:16,675
Excuse me?

517
00:46:16,846 --> 00:46:19,838
I just thought that was....

518
00:46:20,016 --> 00:46:22,713
I just was laughing in agreement.

519
00:46:24,922 --> 00:46:26,686
Happy monkey.

520
00:46:28,493 --> 00:46:30,223
All right, kids. This way.

521
00:46:35,534 --> 00:46:37,661
Let me tell you something.
I'm not buying it.

522
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:41,330
You might have them fooled,
you might have the kids fooled. Not me.

523
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:44,909
Can't get past me.
There's a storm coming, buddy.

524
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:46,569
There's a storm coming.

525
00:46:49,483 --> 00:46:52,715
One of the most famous trackers
in history, Sakagawea was the woman...

526
00:46:52,887 --> 00:46:56,153
...who led Lewis and Clark on
their expedition to find the Pacific Ocean.

527
00:46:56,325 --> 00:46:59,590
You guys have heard the saying,
"Actions speak louder than words."

528
00:46:59,762 --> 00:47:01,787
And yet they wrote--

529
00:47:01,965 --> 00:47:04,694
-Yes, Mr. Daley?
-Yes. Was she deaf?

530
00:47:05,969 --> 00:47:09,804
Was she deaf? No. She was not.
But she--

531
00:47:09,974 --> 00:47:15,277
Yeah, because-- Just-- She does seem
a little bit sort of unresponsive.

532
00:47:15,447 --> 00:47:17,074
That's because she's a statue.

533
00:47:19,251 --> 00:47:23,018
Kids, could you give me one sec?
Go check her out. She's really cool.

534
00:47:25,058 --> 00:47:27,492
-What are you doing?
-I'm gonna be here every night.

535
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,494
I wanted to learn a little bit more
about what I'm guarding.

536
00:47:30,664 --> 00:47:32,656
Actually, I've got a bunch of questions.

537
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:35,735
Maybe when you have a break,
could I buy you a cup of coffee?

538
00:47:35,904 --> 00:47:37,235
A cup of coffee?

539
00:47:37,405 --> 00:47:39,636
Yeah, I mean, just purely a, you know...

540
00:47:39,809 --> 00:47:44,303
...colleague-to-colleague,
information-download sort of coffee.

541
00:47:45,414 --> 00:47:47,406
I finish in 20 minutes.
I'll meet you outside.

542
00:47:47,583 --> 00:47:49,074
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

543
00:47:49,253 --> 00:47:52,051
-And have a good rest of your--
-All right. Okay, kids.

544
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:54,652
It was incredible what she did.

545
00:47:54,826 --> 00:47:58,024
She literally led these men
across rivers, up mountains...

546
00:47:58,196 --> 00:48:01,758
...all with her newborn baby on her back.
She was the ultimate working mother.

547
00:48:01,934 --> 00:48:04,267
Wow, you are quite
the Sakagawean expert.

548
00:48:04,437 --> 00:48:06,496
-Sakagawean.
-Sakagawean?

549
00:48:06,673 --> 00:48:10,940
Yeah. I should be, I've been writing
my dissertation on her for four years.

550
00:48:11,112 --> 00:48:15,048
You've been working on one paper
for four years? That would drive me crazy.

551
00:48:15,216 --> 00:48:19,313
Actually, it's more like a 900-page book.

552
00:48:19,922 --> 00:48:23,882
So, what's your story? Have you
always wanted to be a security guard?

553
00:48:24,727 --> 00:48:27,925
-Oh, I didn't mean to--
-No, no, no.

554
00:48:28,098 --> 00:48:31,932
No, I'm divorced
and I have a 1 0-year-old son...

555
00:48:32,102 --> 00:48:35,902
...so I needed to find
a more steady situation.

556
00:48:36,073 --> 00:48:39,100
Got it. So, what can I tell you
about the museum?

557
00:48:39,277 --> 00:48:42,304
Okay, Attila the Hun.
What is that guy's problem?

558
00:48:42,481 --> 00:48:45,541
Attila was considered the only
genuine threat to the Roman Empire.

559
00:48:46,152 --> 00:48:48,985
" Known as the 'Scourge of God'...

560
00:48:49,155 --> 00:48:53,753
...Attila and his Huns would often
tear off the limbs of their helpless victims.

561
00:48:55,796 --> 00:48:58,129
Attila was famous
for his superstitious beliefs.

562
00:48:58,299 --> 00:49:02,361
He surrounded himself with a phalanx
of sorcerers and magicians...

563
00:49:02,537 --> 00:49:05,770
...who advised and mystified him
with their dark arts."

564
00:49:58,469 --> 00:49:59,959
Larry?

565
00:50:00,271 --> 00:50:01,932
Just wanted to say good luck, son.

566
00:50:02,173 --> 00:50:04,698
And goodbye.
We're clocking out for the last time.

567
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:06,469
If you're ever in Boca, look us up.

568
00:50:06,645 --> 00:50:09,843
Wait, you guys are going out of town?
What if this doesn't work out?

569
00:50:10,015 --> 00:50:12,541
Smart fellow like you? You'll be fine.

570
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:17,247
Yeah. We'll just be a phone call away.
Come on, walk us out.

571
00:50:17,425 --> 00:50:20,292
You fellas go ahead.

572
00:50:21,495 --> 00:50:23,156
I need a moment.

573
00:50:23,331 --> 00:50:27,996
He's very emotional.
A lot of memories in this room.

574
00:51:24,235 --> 00:51:26,363
Go crazy, big guy.

575
00:51:31,544 --> 00:51:33,205
Hey, guys.

576
00:51:33,379 --> 00:51:35,347
Quest for fire...

577
00:51:35,849 --> 00:51:39,046
...over. Knock yourselves out.

578
00:51:40,888 --> 00:51:42,220
Morning, dum-dum.

579
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:46,087
Me no dum-dum. You dum-dum.
You bring me gum-gum?

580
00:51:46,261 --> 00:51:50,323
Yes, I did, fathead.
Lots and lots of gum-gum.

581
00:52:10,122 --> 00:52:15,254
What's that?
I can't hear you through the glass.

582
00:52:17,163 --> 00:52:18,755
Sorry.

583
00:52:19,365 --> 00:52:21,061
Heave.

584
00:52:21,535 --> 00:52:24,471
Heave. Heave.

585
00:52:24,638 --> 00:52:27,199
Hey, what's going on over here?

586
00:52:27,374 --> 00:52:29,707
We expand or we die.

587
00:52:30,011 --> 00:52:32,173
Heave.

588
00:52:32,348 --> 00:52:33,872
-Heave.
-On the count of three...

589
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:37,487
...you blow this anthill to kingdom come.

590
00:52:38,055 --> 00:52:41,456
-And a one and a two--
-Hey, Jed. Stop that.

591
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:45,460
No, no. You blow a hole in your mountain,
all you're gonna hit is a wall.

592
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:49,965
Step aside, Gigantor. We got us a railroad
to build. We're blowing a hole in that thing.

593
00:52:50,135 --> 00:52:53,468
Okay, first of all, enough with
the Gigantor giant stuff, okay?

594
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:57,406
-I'm just trying to close up shop.
-We're gonna blow it anyway. And a three!

595
00:52:58,879 --> 00:53:02,474
Yeah. What are you doing?

596
00:53:02,783 --> 00:53:05,911
What's it look like we're doing?
It's manifest destiny.

597
00:53:06,087 --> 00:53:09,888
You can't fight it and neither can l.
Go! More dynamite.

598
00:53:10,092 --> 00:53:12,560
-Yeah, use it all.
-All right. Okay.

599
00:53:12,728 --> 00:53:15,390
Listen, "Octavus"? You gotta stop that.

600
00:53:15,564 --> 00:53:17,499
It's Octavius, mary.

601
00:53:17,667 --> 00:53:21,330
Okay, you know what? Fine. Great.
Here you go. This is what happens.

602
00:53:21,505 --> 00:53:23,735
-You cannot do this. I am a Roman general.
-Sorry.

603
00:53:23,908 --> 00:53:25,170
-I have rights.
-And you.

604
00:53:25,342 --> 00:53:27,834
-Hey, no! Put me down!
-Keep heaving, men.

605
00:53:28,012 --> 00:53:29,310
You can't stop progress!

606
00:53:29,481 --> 00:53:31,676
We're gonna have a little talk, okay?

607
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:34,851
I told you, I don't like to be manhandled.

608
00:53:35,021 --> 00:53:38,617
No, I will manhandle you, Jedediah.
Now, listen, guys.

609
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:41,352
What is your problem, huh?
Why can't you just get along?

610
00:53:41,595 --> 00:53:43,927
Look, we're men. We fight, okay?
That's what we do.

611
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:45,689
It's kind of how we pass the time.

612
00:53:45,933 --> 00:53:50,234
You're, like, a giant. A freak, if you will.
We can't expect you to understand that.

613
00:53:50,405 --> 00:53:54,068
You got the whole room to run around in.
You don't have to be near each other.

614
00:53:54,677 --> 00:53:58,375
-What, you mean...?
-You're gonna let us out?

615
00:53:58,915 --> 00:54:01,281
What, and just roam free?

616
00:54:02,018 --> 00:54:04,579
Yeah. Yeah, I might,
if you promise to behave.

617
00:54:04,754 --> 00:54:07,883
That means no fireballs,
no explosions, okay?

618
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,288
You have my word, my liege.

619
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,123
Yeah, no problemo, Gigantor.

620
00:54:12,297 --> 00:54:16,200
My name's Larry, first of all. Okay, Jed?

621
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:19,099
So I call you Jed.
I don't call you Tiny, right?

622
00:54:19,272 --> 00:54:20,831
What's that supposed to mean?

623
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:26,605
-"Hey, Teeny." How does that sound?
-I don't like it. It hurts my feelings.

624
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:29,510
"Gigantor" makes me feel
like some sort of freak, so....

625
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,152
I don't. I just call you Larry.

626
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,312
Don't be a kiss-ass, okay?

627
00:54:34,489 --> 00:54:36,321
Look, I'm trusting you guys, all right?

628
00:54:36,492 --> 00:54:39,928
If you don't do what I say,
you can end up like the Mayan world there.

629
00:54:40,129 --> 00:54:42,188
Locked up. Take a look.

630
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:45,564
-Do they look happy?
-No.

631
00:54:46,803 --> 00:54:48,168
They look sad.

632
00:54:48,338 --> 00:54:51,399
They can't do what they wanna do.
Now, I'm letting you guys...

633
00:54:51,576 --> 00:54:54,807
...have a little bit of leash here.
Don't choke me with it, okay?

634
00:54:54,979 --> 00:54:59,144
I gotta run. You guys play nice, okay?
Okay. Good. Thanks.

635
00:55:00,886 --> 00:55:03,117
Hey, how's that gum treating you,
dum-dum?

636
00:55:03,289 --> 00:55:04,620
Good.

637
00:55:08,029 --> 00:55:10,827
Oh, hey, Dexter.
I'm just locking up. You want in?

638
00:55:12,501 --> 00:55:14,093
Yeah?

639
00:55:15,704 --> 00:55:17,296
All right.

640
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,179
What's that? You got my keys?

641
00:55:27,785 --> 00:55:29,184
I don't think so.

642
00:55:31,122 --> 00:55:35,616
Looks like Uncle Larry pulled a fast one
on little Dexie.

643
00:55:35,794 --> 00:55:37,786
Those are baby keys for a little baby.

644
00:55:37,963 --> 00:55:40,158
Have fun with your baby keys,
little baby monkey.

645
00:55:40,332 --> 00:55:43,769
Tomorrow I'll bring you a little baby diapy
so you can go poo-poo in it.

646
00:55:43,937 --> 00:55:46,269
I'll give you a tickle
because you're a cute baby.

647
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,242
While you cry all night long
about how Uncle Larry fooled you, huh?

648
00:55:51,712 --> 00:55:53,737
I told you there was a storm coming.

649
00:56:01,156 --> 00:56:03,386
-Hey, Teddy.
-Lawrence.

650
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:06,155
You impertinent pup.
I knew you'd come back.

651
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:10,060
-You look like a man on a mission.
-Yeah, I'm gonna give it another shot.

652
00:56:17,976 --> 00:56:20,570
-You...?
-What?

653
00:56:20,745 --> 00:56:24,046
-You checking her out?
-The nerve.

654
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:27,210
Checking her out.
I've never heard of such a thing.

655
00:56:27,386 --> 00:56:31,324
No, no, no. I'm just-- I mean
because, you know, she's very beautiful.

656
00:56:31,493 --> 00:56:33,221
-Beautiful?
-Yeah.

657
00:56:37,298 --> 00:56:39,893
-Rather handsome woman, I suppose.
-Yeah.

658
00:56:40,336 --> 00:56:42,897
I don't know,
maybe you should go talk to her.

659
00:56:43,072 --> 00:56:45,667
-lndeed. Bless you, lad.
-Yeah. All right.

660
00:56:45,841 --> 00:56:48,709
-Carry on.
-Good. See you.

661
00:57:05,832 --> 00:57:07,595
I....

662
00:57:55,323 --> 00:57:56,984
Hey, hi.

663
00:57:57,692 --> 00:58:01,288
No! It's okay!
It's okay. You guys speak English?

664
00:58:01,697 --> 00:58:02,823
No?

665
00:58:05,635 --> 00:58:07,330
Right. I don't know what that means...

666
00:58:07,503 --> 00:58:11,600
...and I know that you and I got off
on the wrong foot last night, but...

667
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:18,174
...a little birdie told me
that somebody likes...

668
00:58:19,017 --> 00:58:20,245
...magic.

669
00:58:20,418 --> 00:58:23,353
-Magic?
-Magic.

670
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:25,885
Sorcery.

671
00:58:26,192 --> 00:58:27,591
Ah, sorcer--

672
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,195
Yes. Illusion.

673
00:58:30,529 --> 00:58:32,019
Everybody likes magic.

674
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:36,159
And flowers. People like flowers.

675
00:58:36,336 --> 00:58:37,861
There you go. Those are for you.

676
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:40,599
You know what else people like?
Money.

677
00:58:40,775 --> 00:58:45,145
The almighty dollar, right?
But money can sometimes...

678
00:58:46,048 --> 00:58:47,379
...disappear.

679
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,211
At least that's what l...

680
00:58:52,923 --> 00:58:54,151
...hear.

681
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,492
No wonder you can't understand me.
You got a coin in your ear.

682
00:59:02,901 --> 00:59:05,563
Check this out. Anybody need a hanky?

683
00:59:05,904 --> 00:59:10,239
Well, I wouldn't suggest this little
feller because he has a nasty habit...

684
00:59:10,743 --> 00:59:13,075
...of vanishing...

685
00:59:15,182 --> 00:59:17,150
...into thin air!

686
00:59:18,085 --> 00:59:20,418
No, no. Don't. That defeats the-- Don't!

687
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:42,610
Not the limbs. Guys, please,
do not tear the limbs.

688
00:59:59,132 --> 01:00:00,965
Cortes, right?

689
01:00:16,987 --> 01:00:18,215
How?

690
01:00:20,657 --> 01:00:23,525
You! Don't even think about it.
Don't you--

691
01:00:24,396 --> 01:00:25,863
Dexter!

692
01:00:36,343 --> 01:00:37,833
Come on, guys!

693
01:01:03,275 --> 01:01:04,833
Hey, guys!

694
01:01:09,047 --> 01:01:11,538
Hey, guys. Hey, guys!

695
01:01:13,653 --> 01:01:15,587
Sorry. What's going on?
What happened here?

696
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,086
I thought we had a deal.

697
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,487
We will never coexist
with these buffoons.

698
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:21,594
We're past words, Laredo.

699
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:24,822
Now it's time to let Smith & Wesson
do the talking!

700
01:01:24,999 --> 01:01:26,296
Those guns don't even work.

701
01:01:26,468 --> 01:01:28,732
They don't? Take a look at this.

702
01:01:31,841 --> 01:01:33,069
Dexter!

703
01:02:22,499 --> 01:02:23,761
Why?

704
01:02:30,642 --> 01:02:32,736
Ho! Dexter.

705
01:02:40,287 --> 01:02:42,347
End of the line, cool breeze.

706
01:02:43,924 --> 01:02:45,358
End of the line.

707
01:03:03,681 --> 01:03:05,478
I am not playing games here.

708
01:03:09,688 --> 01:03:11,349
Just hand them over.

709
01:03:16,596 --> 01:03:18,860
Easy. That's it, Dexter.

710
01:03:19,031 --> 01:03:21,193
Nice and easy, Dex. That's it.

711
01:03:43,393 --> 01:03:45,953
Good Lord, Lawrence!
Why are you slapping a monkey?

712
01:03:46,564 --> 01:03:49,863
Teddy, this guy's been pushing me,
and I'm sick of it!

713
01:03:50,068 --> 01:03:53,094
Poppycock. This little creature is
your primate brother.

714
01:03:53,271 --> 01:03:55,068
Without him, there's no us.

715
01:03:55,607 --> 01:03:56,905
Are you rabid?

716
01:03:57,109 --> 01:03:58,737
Wipe that off.

717
01:03:59,479 --> 01:04:02,107
You have to deal with this creature
with love and respect.

718
01:04:02,281 --> 01:04:04,113
May I have the keys, dear friend?

719
01:04:05,586 --> 01:04:07,987
Thank you. Lawrence?

720
01:04:10,091 --> 01:04:11,285
Well, you know what?

721
01:04:11,459 --> 01:04:14,554
You seem to know what you're doing,
so I'm gonna let you take over.

722
01:04:14,729 --> 01:04:17,790
No, no. My dear boy, you can't put up
the white flag now.

723
01:04:17,966 --> 01:04:19,958
The museum is on the verge
of total anarchy.

724
01:04:20,136 --> 01:04:21,865
I tried! I came back tonight,
didn't l?

725
01:04:22,038 --> 01:04:25,406
Tried? That was one night. I didn't build
the Panama Canal in one day.

726
01:04:25,609 --> 01:04:28,773
That's great, but I'm dealing with
the most ridiculous job in history.

727
01:04:28,945 --> 01:04:30,504
Some men are born great, Lawrence--

728
01:04:30,682 --> 01:04:33,116
Yeah, I know. Others have
greatness thrust upon them.

729
01:04:33,384 --> 01:04:35,216
You hit me with that chestnut
last night.

730
01:04:35,387 --> 01:04:37,912
The thing is, not everyone is great.

731
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:40,685
That's the problem.
Some of us are just ordinary.

732
01:04:40,893 --> 01:04:43,522
No, you're not, Lawrence.
Stop wallowing in self-pity.

733
01:04:43,697 --> 01:04:45,392
Every journey begins with a footstep.

734
01:04:45,565 --> 01:04:48,830
Teach the inhabitants to get along,
they wouldn't need to be locked up.

735
01:04:49,003 --> 01:04:52,063
That means a lot coming from a guy
who's spent the last 50 years...

736
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:54,504
...spying on a girl he's never even
talked to.

737
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:58,302
I was going to make contact.
Lawrence, please.

738
01:04:59,147 --> 01:05:00,979
I'm done, all right?

739
01:05:05,321 --> 01:05:08,553
No, Rexy! No!

740
01:05:40,195 --> 01:05:42,288
Oh, no.

741
01:06:45,605 --> 01:06:47,436
All right.

742
01:06:56,518 --> 01:07:00,318
No one comes here anymore. Besides,
I took this tour in second grade, Daley.

743
01:07:00,488 --> 01:07:02,889
I'm telling you,
my dad's gonna hook us up.

744
01:07:03,191 --> 01:07:05,490
-Mr. Daley?
-Yeah?

745
01:07:06,963 --> 01:07:08,863
-Foam.
-Yes, I know.

746
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:10,363
In the Neanderthal display.

747
01:07:10,534 --> 01:07:13,503
There was an incident last night
with the fire extinguisher.

748
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:15,298
I was on my way to go clean it up.

749
01:07:15,472 --> 01:07:17,941
Okay, don't bother. You're fired.

750
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:21,940
I don't think we're getting a tour today.

751
01:07:22,113 --> 01:07:24,139
Your dad just got canned, dude.

752
01:07:25,651 --> 01:07:27,677
Excuse me?

753
01:07:28,053 --> 01:07:29,645
Mr. McPhee?

754
01:07:30,522 --> 01:07:31,956
Excuse me, Mr. McPhee?

755
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:34,458
Can I talk to you about this, please?

756
01:07:34,629 --> 01:07:35,755
-Sir?
-What?

757
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:38,831
I know I screwed up, but I finally
understand how to do this job.

758
01:07:39,001 --> 01:07:42,129
-You obviously don't.
-No, I didn't, but now I do.

759
01:07:42,304 --> 01:07:45,068
-Really, Mr. McPhee--
-Doctor.

760
01:07:45,874 --> 01:07:47,672
Dr. McPhee.

761
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:50,511
Can you please give me one more night?

762
01:07:53,249 --> 01:07:55,445
-One more night.
-Okay, thank you.

763
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:58,953
And if anything is the tiniest...

764
01:08:00,191 --> 01:08:01,886
...after your shift:

765
01:08:03,895 --> 01:08:05,192
Because....

766
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,895
-Got it.
-Okay?

767
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:13,801
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice....

768
01:08:18,712 --> 01:08:21,944
Shame on me. Fool me--
Shame on me.

769
01:08:22,116 --> 01:08:24,585
-You.
-Fool me twice.... Got it.

770
01:08:24,819 --> 01:08:27,516
-Take it or leave it.
-Okay. Thank you.

771
01:08:32,361 --> 01:08:33,556
-Hey.
-Hey.

772
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:36,859
-What's wrong?
-Maybe you should ask Nicky.

773
01:08:39,403 --> 01:08:42,134
Hey, buddy. What's going on?

774
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:44,298
You got fired.

775
01:08:44,742 --> 01:08:46,904
What are you talking about?
I didn't get fired.

776
01:08:48,314 --> 01:08:52,148
I came to the museum this morning.
I saw your boss yelling at you.

777
01:08:53,086 --> 01:08:55,783
Why didn't you tell me?
Everything's fine.

778
01:08:55,956 --> 01:08:58,015
We just had a little misunderstanding.

779
01:08:58,192 --> 01:08:59,592
Why?

780
01:09:00,962 --> 01:09:03,954
It's hard to explain.
I mean, you wouldn't bel--

781
01:09:05,233 --> 01:09:08,225
You know what? Let me show you.

782
01:09:08,636 --> 01:09:10,901
-Show me what?
-Come to work with me tonight.

783
01:09:11,073 --> 01:09:12,404
Larry?

784
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:15,272
Can I talk to you for a second?

785
01:09:18,416 --> 01:09:19,713
Am I in trouble?

786
01:09:19,884 --> 01:09:21,647
Larry, what are you doing?

787
01:09:21,852 --> 01:09:24,185
I just wanna show him what I do.
That's all.

788
01:09:24,355 --> 01:09:27,382
I love that you wanna share that
with him, but I gotta tell you...

789
01:09:27,559 --> 01:09:31,087
...I don't think Nicky has any room
in his heart for more disappointment.

790
01:09:32,464 --> 01:09:34,056
He won't be disappointed.

791
01:09:34,801 --> 01:09:36,098
Larry.

792
01:09:36,669 --> 01:09:38,638
He won't be disappointed.

793
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:47,647
Listen, hang out in the security
office till everyone's gone.

794
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:49,545
Then I'm gonna come get you.
All right?

795
01:10:09,574 --> 01:10:12,772
Hey, miss? I'm gonna have to ask you
to vacate the premises.

796
01:10:12,945 --> 01:10:14,242
-Hey there.
-Hey.

797
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:19,044
-Good place to think, huh?
-Yeah. Definitely.

798
01:10:20,187 --> 01:10:22,679
So no big plans tonight?

799
01:10:22,856 --> 01:10:25,690
Yeah, no, I'm not really
a big-plan person.

800
01:10:26,027 --> 01:10:28,791
I prefer hanging out with people
who are dead for 200 years.

801
01:10:28,963 --> 01:10:30,591
It's the live ones that throw me.

802
01:10:30,766 --> 01:10:34,600
That's cool. Seriously though,
you do have to leave.

803
01:10:34,804 --> 01:10:36,863
-Seriously?
-Yeah, sorry. It's museum rules.

804
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,669
We're sort of locking everything up.

805
01:10:39,843 --> 01:10:43,041
You're really taking your job seriously.

806
01:10:43,214 --> 01:10:46,615
You know, once I clip on the tie,
I'm all business.

807
01:10:46,784 --> 01:10:47,978
-I get it.
-Yeah.

808
01:10:48,152 --> 01:10:49,984
How's that dissertation coming?

809
01:10:51,357 --> 01:10:54,656
I've hit a dead end. I mean,
research can only get me so far.

810
01:10:54,827 --> 01:10:56,728
I'm never gonna know
who she really was.

811
01:10:57,396 --> 01:11:01,561
So I think it's time that I move on
to another subject.

812
01:11:02,169 --> 01:11:03,864
I'll let you get back to work.

813
01:11:05,573 --> 01:11:09,100
-Good night, Larry.
-Yeah, okay.

814
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:11,141
Night.

815
01:11:18,254 --> 01:11:19,654
Hey.

816
01:11:21,258 --> 01:11:22,885
Rebecca!

817
01:11:25,429 --> 01:11:27,660
-Hey, Rebecca.
-Hey.

818
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:31,064
Hey. Listen, I don't think you should
give up on your paper.

819
01:11:31,269 --> 01:11:33,067
Okay. Why?

820
01:11:33,238 --> 01:11:36,002
All right, look, this is gonna
sound crazy, all right?

821
01:11:36,175 --> 01:11:38,770
I mean, it's gonna sound, like,
really, really crazy.

822
01:11:38,945 --> 01:11:41,641
-Okay.
-No, I mean insanely crazy.

823
01:11:41,814 --> 01:11:43,442
-I can handle it.
-Okay.

824
01:11:44,451 --> 01:11:48,182
You know how they say in certain
museums, history comes alive?

825
01:11:48,355 --> 01:11:51,223
-Yeah.
-ln this museum...

826
01:11:52,093 --> 01:11:53,618
...it actually does.

827
01:11:55,431 --> 01:11:57,058
What are you talking about?

828
01:12:01,537 --> 01:12:05,975
Everything in this museum
comes to life at night.

829
01:12:09,479 --> 01:12:12,609
-Really?
-Yeah, really. I'm not kidding you.

830
01:12:12,785 --> 01:12:14,912
You know that tablet?
The Tablet of Ahkmenrah?

831
01:12:15,087 --> 01:12:18,056
It actually brings things to life.
It's like some ancient spell.

832
01:12:18,225 --> 01:12:20,954
Since the '50s, every night
everything's been coming to life.

833
01:12:21,127 --> 01:12:26,224
Teddy Roosevelt told me. Seriously.
The monkey, Dexter? The cute little--

834
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,867
-What is he?
-Capuchin.

835
01:12:28,034 --> 01:12:31,335
A capuchin. Right. The capuchin.
He urinated on me and bit my nose.

836
01:12:32,273 --> 01:12:36,210
And Sakagawea is in her case,
alive every night...

837
01:12:36,378 --> 01:12:38,573
...just listening to Lewis and Clark
argue.

838
01:12:38,747 --> 01:12:41,182
So if you really wanna get inside
her head...

839
01:12:42,586 --> 01:12:44,451
...I can hook that up.

840
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:47,252
That's cool.

841
01:12:47,424 --> 01:12:50,553
Yeah, it's cool. It's freaking awesome.

842
01:12:53,932 --> 01:12:55,866
Make fun of the history geek.

843
01:12:56,835 --> 01:12:59,703
-No. Rebecca!
-Good night, Larry.

844
01:13:01,741 --> 01:13:04,540
No, I'm not making fun of you.
Rebecca.

845
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:17,992
-Here you go. Best seat in the house.
-What's going on?

846
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,721
If I told you, you'd think I'm crazy.
I'm gonna show you.

847
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:24,424
-What?
-You'll see in about 20 seconds.

848
01:13:24,601 --> 01:13:26,432
-Okay, you like Tyrannosaurus Rex?
-Yeah.

849
01:13:26,603 --> 01:13:29,072
Yeah? Well, I call him Rexy.

850
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:33,735
And he's about to come to life,
Nicholas, in...

851
01:13:36,114 --> 01:13:41,109
...five, four, three, two....

852
01:13:48,262 --> 01:13:50,731
-Dad?
-Hang on a sec.

853
01:13:50,931 --> 01:13:54,299
Say hello to Rexy!

854
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:56,563
Dad, are you okay?

855
01:13:58,941 --> 01:14:00,464
This is weird.

856
01:14:00,643 --> 01:14:02,770
Guys! Come on!

857
01:14:03,312 --> 01:14:05,143
Sundown!

858
01:14:07,284 --> 01:14:10,721
Hey, T.R., come on, rise and shine.
Buddy, I need you to wake up.

859
01:14:10,887 --> 01:14:12,981
Come on, my kid is here.
I need you to wake up.

860
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:16,285
Texas? Texas! Come on!
Texas! Come on! Get on, Texas!

861
01:14:16,627 --> 01:14:18,356
Get on, Texas! Get up.

862
01:14:18,529 --> 01:14:20,658
Just stop, okay?

863
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:24,291
No, Nicky, I'm telling you,
there's this tablet, okay?

864
01:14:24,471 --> 01:14:26,564
Called the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.
Every night--

865
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:29,403
-Now there's a tablet?
-Yeah, there is.

866
01:14:29,577 --> 01:14:31,135
Come on, Dad.

867
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:34,208
Come on.

868
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,655
-It's gone.
-What's gone?

869
01:14:40,822 --> 01:14:44,281
The tablet. I think somebody stole it.

870
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:46,355
Yeah, right.

871
01:14:46,663 --> 01:14:48,357
I'm not kidding, Nicky.

872
01:14:52,002 --> 01:14:53,367
Nicky?

873
01:14:55,306 --> 01:14:57,274
Hey, Nicky!

874
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:01,474
Hey! Hey, Nicky! Where are you going?

875
01:15:01,646 --> 01:15:04,582
-Home.
-What? Wait a minute.

876
01:15:09,055 --> 01:15:10,522
Come on.

877
01:15:19,534 --> 01:15:21,799
You guys shouldn't be here.

878
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:23,198
Give us the tablet, son.

879
01:15:23,372 --> 01:15:25,364
Wait a minute, Nicky.
What are you guys doing?

880
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:27,772
We're not gonna hurt you.
Give us the tablet.

881
01:15:27,944 --> 01:15:30,913
I'm sorry to tell you this, son,
but your dad doesn't work here.

882
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:34,141
He got fired this morning.
Couldn't hack it.

883
01:15:34,318 --> 01:15:37,254
Dad? I thought you said
you weren't fired.

884
01:15:37,422 --> 01:15:39,788
I did. They're lying,
trying to steal that thing.

885
01:15:39,958 --> 01:15:42,621
Turn the middle piece,
you'll see what I was talking about.

886
01:15:42,794 --> 01:15:44,659
That is museum property, son.
Give it back.

887
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:46,764
Nicky, trust me. Just turn it.

888
01:15:46,966 --> 01:15:49,093
-Give us the tablet!
-Nicky?

889
01:15:49,803 --> 01:15:51,236
Trust me.

890
01:16:13,663 --> 01:16:15,130
Nick? Run. Now.

891
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:18,200
Get back here, kid!

892
01:16:20,906 --> 01:16:22,600
Bad idea, Larry.

893
01:16:23,008 --> 01:16:25,533
You wanna dance, hot dog?
You wanna dance?

894
01:16:25,712 --> 01:16:27,839
Gus, you're an old man.
I don't wanna hurt you.

895
01:16:30,183 --> 01:16:33,915
You see, Larry, a few years into
the job, the three of us realized that...

896
01:16:34,088 --> 01:16:38,218
...Iike everything else in this museum,
we got new life at night.

897
01:16:38,392 --> 01:16:41,623
Sundown to sunrise,
we felt young again.

898
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:45,390
Okay. Did not see that coming.

899
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:47,229
Gave us an energy boost.

900
01:16:47,403 --> 01:16:49,667
We love the nightlife, Larry.

901
01:16:49,839 --> 01:16:52,001
So when we found out
they were gonna fired us...

902
01:16:52,175 --> 01:16:53,642
...we had to steal the tablet.

903
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,836
Everyone knows you need the money.

904
01:16:56,013 --> 01:16:57,878
Add the stuff we planted
in your place...

905
01:16:58,048 --> 01:17:00,175
...pretty obvious you committed
the crime.

906
01:17:00,351 --> 01:17:02,251
Take care of that cut.

907
01:17:02,420 --> 01:17:04,389
Come on, guys, let's go find that kid.

908
01:17:06,358 --> 01:17:08,384
-Sweet dreams, cupcake!
-No!

909
01:17:08,561 --> 01:17:09,995
Pile driver!

910
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:12,730
Let's get our tablet.

911
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:40,862
Thank you very much.
We'll take it from here.

912
01:17:41,065 --> 01:17:42,590
Nicky!

913
01:17:44,603 --> 01:17:47,402
Just in time, Larry.
We were just locking up.

914
01:17:48,907 --> 01:17:51,001
Sleep tight, hotshot.

915
01:17:52,812 --> 01:17:54,712
Let's grab everything we can fence.

916
01:17:54,881 --> 01:17:59,181
I don't know about you,
but I'm planning on a long retirement.

917
01:18:07,162 --> 01:18:10,620
Teddy! Teddy, if you're out there,
I need you, pal!

918
01:18:13,168 --> 01:18:14,363
Someone call my name?

919
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:18,606
Theodore Roosevelt, at your service.

920
01:18:18,776 --> 01:18:20,641
Teddy, can you get us out of here?

921
01:18:20,811 --> 01:18:23,075
Can't do it, man. This is your moment.

922
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,771
Will you save the lectures, please?
I'm not you. Okay?

923
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:29,409
I didn't build the Panama Canal,
I wasn't president of the United States!

924
01:18:29,589 --> 01:18:30,783
I need some help. Come on.

925
01:18:30,957 --> 01:18:32,720
Actually...

926
01:18:34,761 --> 01:18:38,721
...I never did any of those things.
Teddy Roosevelt did.

927
01:18:38,899 --> 01:18:41,767
I was made in a mannequin factory
in Poughkeepsie.

928
01:18:41,935 --> 01:18:43,801
I never shot a wild beast.

929
01:18:43,972 --> 01:18:47,203
I'm not even brave enough to tell
that beautiful woman I love her.

930
01:18:47,677 --> 01:18:49,007
But you...

931
01:18:49,779 --> 01:18:53,306
...you gotta finish the job this time.
You can't quit.

932
01:18:56,118 --> 01:18:58,087
I'm made of wax, Larry.

933
01:18:58,789 --> 01:19:00,552
What are you made of?

934
01:19:04,462 --> 01:19:07,796
-Wait! That's all you got for me?
-That's it!

935
01:19:20,147 --> 01:19:22,138
That's it. Come on.

936
01:19:22,983 --> 01:19:24,314
Duck!

937
01:19:25,987 --> 01:19:27,477
Go over there!

938
01:19:47,345 --> 01:19:50,941
Hey. Hi. How you doing?
Sorry to bother you...

939
01:19:51,116 --> 01:19:53,415
...but your guys there? Your jackal guys?

940
01:19:53,586 --> 01:19:55,884
Do you think you could ask them
to back off, please?

941
01:19:56,055 --> 01:19:59,355
We're not trying to hurt you, they think
we are. Could you do it like now?

942
01:20:05,099 --> 01:20:07,693
Thank you. Nicky.

943
01:20:08,437 --> 01:20:09,698
Thank you.

944
01:20:17,647 --> 01:20:19,046
Dad?

945
01:20:30,395 --> 01:20:32,920
You would not believe how stuffy
it is in there.

946
01:20:35,001 --> 01:20:38,027
-How come you speak English?
-I went to Cambridge University.

947
01:20:38,204 --> 01:20:39,297
You went to Cambridge?

948
01:20:39,472 --> 01:20:42,067
I was on display
in the Egyptology Department.

949
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:45,771
I am Ahkmenrah, fourth king
of the fourth king...

950
01:20:45,946 --> 01:20:48,471
...ruler of the land of my fathers.

951
01:20:49,082 --> 01:20:51,244
I am Larry...

952
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,551
...son of Milton...

953
01:20:54,722 --> 01:20:58,090
...and this is my son, Nick.

954
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,751
And we hail from Brooklyn.

955
01:21:01,097 --> 01:21:04,362
Well, I do. I mean, he comes out and
stays with me on Wednesdays...

956
01:21:04,534 --> 01:21:05,796
...and every other weekend.

957
01:21:06,436 --> 01:21:10,772
That was the custody agreement
that we had.

958
01:21:11,242 --> 01:21:14,940
Larry, Nick, guardians of Brooklyn...

959
01:21:15,113 --> 01:21:16,978
...I am forever in your debt.

960
01:21:17,149 --> 01:21:19,743
Now bestow the tablet upon me...

961
01:21:19,918 --> 01:21:22,444
...so that I may assume command
of my kingdom.

962
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:26,259
Oh, yes. Okay, the tablet. I would...

963
01:21:26,427 --> 01:21:29,794
...Iove to bestow it upon you,
but we don't actually...

964
01:21:30,332 --> 01:21:31,662
...have it.

965
01:21:39,809 --> 01:21:42,573
Thanks, guys. Don't worry.
I'll watch out for him!

966
01:21:42,745 --> 01:21:44,110
Thank you.

967
01:21:59,132 --> 01:22:00,826
What is that?

968
01:22:02,201 --> 01:22:03,862
Huns.

969
01:22:04,838 --> 01:22:06,635
I gotta deal with this guy.

970
01:22:43,349 --> 01:22:45,579
Pardon me, Larry. I speak Hun.

971
01:22:53,528 --> 01:22:55,429
He says that he wants to rip you apart.

972
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:58,122
All right. Again with the ripping.
Listen, I understand.

973
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:01,792
I get it. Ripping for you....
You want to rip things, okay?

974
01:23:01,972 --> 01:23:05,931
And I think maybe that's because
somebody ripped you a long time ago.

975
01:23:06,409 --> 01:23:07,899
In here.

976
01:23:08,578 --> 01:23:10,774
Somebody ripped little...

977
01:23:10,948 --> 01:23:13,917
...baby Attila a long time ago,
right here.

978
01:23:15,087 --> 01:23:18,488
They ripped something out,
didn't they?

979
01:23:20,259 --> 01:23:21,920
They ripped the love.

980
01:23:22,729 --> 01:23:25,061
They ripped the love right out of you,
didn't they?

981
01:23:25,932 --> 01:23:29,494
A little baby all alone in a tent...

982
01:23:30,237 --> 01:23:32,569
...whose daddy went off...

983
01:23:33,407 --> 01:23:36,377
...to pillage some town...

984
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:39,274
...or go and plunder somewhere,
just doing his job.

985
01:23:39,448 --> 01:23:41,575
But who was left alone?

986
01:23:44,954 --> 01:23:46,820
You.

987
01:23:51,962 --> 01:23:55,694
Let it out. Let it go. Let it go.

988
01:24:16,323 --> 01:24:19,919
It's okay. It's okay.

989
01:24:21,564 --> 01:24:23,759
You're next.

990
01:24:27,637 --> 01:24:30,505
Good. That's good. Just breathe.

991
01:24:34,511 --> 01:24:35,877
-Larry Daley.
-Yeah.

992
01:24:39,517 --> 01:24:41,382
Good. Yes.

993
01:24:41,954 --> 01:24:43,819
Yeah. Okay. Good, good.

994
01:24:45,691 --> 01:24:48,525
All right!
I need everybody to listen up!

995
01:24:52,199 --> 01:24:53,667
Guys! Come on!

996
01:24:57,471 --> 01:25:03,776
Quiet!

997
01:25:13,556 --> 01:25:15,148
My dum-dum want to speak.

998
01:25:15,326 --> 01:25:17,123
Thank you.

999
01:25:17,995 --> 01:25:20,328
Now, this here's King Ahkmenrah.

1000
01:25:20,499 --> 01:25:23,332
His tablet is what brings you to life
every night.

1001
01:25:23,503 --> 01:25:26,300
And those old night watchmen?
They stole it.

1002
01:25:26,706 --> 01:25:29,368
Now, we need to find those guards
and get the tablet back...

1003
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:31,443
...and we need to do it before morning.

1004
01:25:31,612 --> 01:25:34,775
Civil War guys,
head over to the Planetarium Wing.

1005
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:39,784
My explorer friend
whose name escapes me.

1006
01:25:39,953 --> 01:25:43,321
-It's Columbus.
-Right, Columbus! Right, I'm sorry.

1007
01:25:43,491 --> 01:25:46,290
There's no nameplate, so....
Columbus, take the Neanderthals...

1008
01:25:46,462 --> 01:25:49,397
...and do a sweep from lnvertebrates
all the way through Reptiles.

1009
01:25:49,565 --> 01:25:52,558
Jed and Octavius, their van's parked
out back. Go take care of it.

1010
01:25:52,736 --> 01:25:55,831
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no!
No, sir. I ain't working with toga boy.

1011
01:25:56,006 --> 01:25:57,668
Romans work alone.

1012
01:25:58,442 --> 01:26:00,569
-That didn't hurt. Don't be a baby.
-Yes, it did.

1013
01:26:00,745 --> 01:26:01,973
Come on.

1014
01:26:02,548 --> 01:26:04,209
That was much harder!

1015
01:26:04,383 --> 01:26:05,850
Guys, come on!

1016
01:26:06,685 --> 01:26:08,778
Jed, Octavius.

1017
01:26:08,954 --> 01:26:11,253
Take away the fact you were born
2000 years apart...

1018
01:26:11,424 --> 01:26:12,948
...you guys aren't that different.

1019
01:26:13,527 --> 01:26:15,722
You're both great leaders.

1020
01:26:15,896 --> 01:26:18,126
You just want what's best
for your people, right?

1021
01:26:18,299 --> 01:26:19,698
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1022
01:26:19,867 --> 01:26:21,392
Civil War dudes.

1023
01:26:23,137 --> 01:26:27,940
You guys are brothers, for God's sakes.
You gotta stop fighting.

1024
01:26:28,344 --> 01:26:32,678
North wins. Slavery's bad. Sorry.

1025
01:26:32,848 --> 01:26:38,310
Don't wanna burst your bubble.
But, South, you guys get Allman Brothers...

1026
01:26:39,122 --> 01:26:42,115
...and NASCAR, so just chill!

1027
01:26:43,428 --> 01:26:47,661
Look, without that tablet,
all of this...

1028
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:51,565
...this whole coming-to-life-at-night thing,
it all goes away.

1029
01:26:51,738 --> 01:26:54,831
Now, I don't wanna let that happen,
but I need your help.

1030
01:26:55,008 --> 01:26:57,340
We can get this done,
but we gotta do it together.

1031
01:26:58,511 --> 01:26:59,706
So who's with me?

1032
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:02,776
Yeah.

1033
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:04,884
-Who's with me?
-Yeah!

1034
01:27:05,052 --> 01:27:07,544
-Yeah!
-Charge!

1035
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:11,859
All right! Now, let's do this, people!

1036
01:27:13,963 --> 01:27:15,260
And animals!

1037
01:27:17,134 --> 01:27:20,865
And weird, faceless puppet creatures.
Come on, let's go! Let's do it!

1038
01:27:43,898 --> 01:27:45,832
Come on! Follow me, boys!

1039
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,696
Geronimo!

1040
01:27:59,416 --> 01:28:01,281
Oh, jeez.

1041
01:28:15,335 --> 01:28:19,534
Now, boys, we can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

1042
01:28:24,946 --> 01:28:27,210
I guess it's gonna be the hard way.

1043
01:28:31,053 --> 01:28:34,853
Right, men, we're almost there.

1044
01:28:55,214 --> 01:28:57,409
Save yourself!

1045
01:28:57,583 --> 01:28:59,518
I ain't quitting you!

1046
01:29:01,454 --> 01:29:03,013
Gus?

1047
01:29:05,326 --> 01:29:06,520
Reginald?

1048
01:29:06,962 --> 01:29:08,690
Fellas, where are you?

1049
01:29:10,265 --> 01:29:11,698
Guys?

1050
01:29:22,212 --> 01:29:25,704
That's what I'm talking about.
Good job, gentlemen.

1051
01:29:25,884 --> 01:29:27,351
Loving the teamwork!

1052
01:29:47,442 --> 01:29:50,900
They've vanished.
How will we find them?

1053
01:29:51,846 --> 01:29:53,940
I know someone who can help. Come on.

1054
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:56,881
Watch out!

1055
01:30:03,561 --> 01:30:07,429
Hey, Sakagawea, or wea. Listen,
I need a favor. Somebody stole his tablet.

1056
01:30:07,598 --> 01:30:10,089
You think you can track the guys
who took it?

1057
01:30:10,768 --> 01:30:14,934
He went east
but he lost control and crashed.

1058
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:18,566
You're amazing. How can you tell that?

1059
01:30:22,715 --> 01:30:24,707
He left the wagon...

1060
01:30:24,885 --> 01:30:26,716
...and went back.

1061
01:30:26,887 --> 01:30:28,718
He went back?

1062
01:30:30,024 --> 01:30:31,456
Why would he go back?

1063
01:30:34,196 --> 01:30:35,628
Get out of the way!

1064
01:30:43,807 --> 01:30:45,331
You saved me.

1065
01:30:45,743 --> 01:30:47,768
You're worth saving, my dear.

1066
01:30:50,214 --> 01:30:52,842
-That's problematic.
-Teddy. Oh, man.

1067
01:30:53,018 --> 01:30:55,213
Larry, relax. I'm wax.

1068
01:30:55,387 --> 01:30:57,252
You gotta do something.
Dawn's approaching.

1069
01:30:57,422 --> 01:31:00,688
-Half the museum's running amuck outside.
-He's got my tablet.

1070
01:31:03,396 --> 01:31:05,489
Come on, Ockie!

1071
01:31:11,539 --> 01:31:13,440
At your service, Gigantor!

1072
01:31:13,608 --> 01:31:15,838
How can we be of assistance, my liege?

1073
01:31:16,011 --> 01:31:18,206
Just give me a second, guys.

1074
01:31:22,318 --> 01:31:24,013
Rexy?

1075
01:31:25,389 --> 01:31:26,651
Here, boy.

1076
01:31:26,823 --> 01:31:29,054
Teddy, I need a horse.

1077
01:31:29,227 --> 01:31:30,888
Do it, man.

1078
01:31:46,012 --> 01:31:49,573
-Come on, boy! Let me hear you yell!
-Yeah!

1079
01:31:49,749 --> 01:31:51,615
Just living the dream, baby!

1080
01:31:51,786 --> 01:31:53,413
I'm loving this!

1081
01:31:57,024 --> 01:31:59,186
Pull the stagecoach over now!

1082
01:32:02,097 --> 01:32:03,689
Can I make this turn up here?

1083
01:32:05,768 --> 01:32:08,932
I'll take that as a yes. Hang on!

1084
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:17,111
I can't hold it!

1085
01:32:30,631 --> 01:32:32,293
Come on, Tex, let's finish this.

1086
01:32:33,701 --> 01:32:35,396
Come on!

1087
01:32:40,175 --> 01:32:41,904
Give me the tablet, Cecil!

1088
01:32:42,077 --> 01:32:43,568
Can't do it, son.

1089
01:32:47,049 --> 01:32:48,517
Pull over!

1090
01:32:48,685 --> 01:32:51,813
It ain't gonna happen. Moving on.

1091
01:32:52,523 --> 01:32:55,186
Last chance, Cecil.
Stop the horses or I will!

1092
01:32:55,459 --> 01:32:57,324
They can't be stopped, Larry.

1093
01:32:57,495 --> 01:32:59,157
Don't you know your history?

1094
01:32:59,330 --> 01:33:04,359
These are money carriers. They were trained
not to stop for anything but a secret word.

1095
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:06,436
Really? You mean a word like...

1096
01:33:07,808 --> 01:33:09,434
..." Dakota"?

1097
01:33:14,114 --> 01:33:15,445
Come on, Tex.

1098
01:33:19,688 --> 01:33:22,021
I read up on my history.
Thanks for the tip.

1099
01:33:22,458 --> 01:33:23,686
Oh, and by the way...

1100
01:33:23,859 --> 01:33:26,350
...don't ever talk to me like that
in front of my son.

1101
01:33:28,632 --> 01:33:30,327
Moving on.

1102
01:33:34,404 --> 01:33:36,339
-Hey, Huns.
-Tell Attila to have his boys...

1103
01:33:36,507 --> 01:33:38,498
...take him back.
Put him with the guards.

1104
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:44,444
Oh, and no limb ripping, okay?

1105
01:33:58,232 --> 01:33:59,894
Hey, boy. Wait, wait, hold the phone.

1106
01:34:00,067 --> 01:34:04,095
What's makeekaka mean?
Wait. Translation, please.

1107
01:34:05,942 --> 01:34:09,845
The year was 1 909. I was going up
the Zambezi River in Africa.

1108
01:34:10,013 --> 01:34:13,073
And our river guide was a brilliant Pygmy
who spoke only by clicking.

1109
01:34:21,159 --> 01:34:22,524
There we are.

1110
01:34:26,232 --> 01:34:28,166
-Oh, boy.
-What is it?

1111
01:34:28,334 --> 01:34:30,461
I gotta get you guys
back to the museum.

1112
01:34:32,139 --> 01:34:33,400
How?

1113
01:34:36,144 --> 01:34:38,544
Ahkmenrah, I'm gonna need your help.

1114
01:34:38,713 --> 01:34:41,944
This is your tablet. You know
the instructions. You get everyone back.

1115
01:35:10,016 --> 01:35:12,951
Come on. There's somebody
who's gotta see this.

1116
01:35:15,388 --> 01:35:18,654
What I'm saying is, for the type of money
that they pay A-Rod...

1117
01:35:18,826 --> 01:35:22,024
...he ought to be bringing home
a World Series trophy every season.

1118
01:35:22,530 --> 01:35:24,260
You know what I mean?

1119
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:45,281
Now, who they gonna get
to clean up all that doo-doo?

1120
01:35:45,457 --> 01:35:46,651
-lnuit.
-Yeah.

1121
01:35:46,825 --> 01:35:48,520
One terracotta soldier.

1122
01:35:48,695 --> 01:35:49,923
-Vikings.
-Right.

1123
01:35:50,095 --> 01:35:52,086
-Alpaca.
-Welcome back, ladies.

1124
01:35:52,265 --> 01:35:53,857
-Llama.
-Hey.

1125
01:35:54,033 --> 01:35:55,365
Viking guys.

1126
01:35:55,536 --> 01:35:58,004
Do me a favor. Your fellows
made some funeral pyre...

1127
01:35:58,172 --> 01:36:00,299
...in Petrified Wood. Go clean that up.

1128
01:36:00,474 --> 01:36:01,839
Okay? Thank you.

1129
01:36:03,278 --> 01:36:05,940
-He's back.
-All right, I'll deal with this joker.

1130
01:36:06,114 --> 01:36:09,242
Hey, hey, Moose.
It's not gonna happen, buddy. All right?

1131
01:36:09,417 --> 01:36:11,852
I told you, you can't come through
with those antlers.

1132
01:36:12,021 --> 01:36:15,047
So you and your caribou buddy
gotta go around to the loading dock.

1133
01:36:15,224 --> 01:36:17,921
-Lawrence!
-Hey, Teddy.

1134
01:36:18,595 --> 01:36:20,256
Great to see you in one piece.

1135
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:22,831
Sakagawea, a little hot wax,
and I'm a new man.

1136
01:36:23,001 --> 01:36:24,696
Larry?

1137
01:36:29,174 --> 01:36:31,438
I told you I wasn't making fun of you.

1138
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:34,272
-I know.
-Teddy?

1139
01:36:35,849 --> 01:36:39,115
Oh, my God.

1140
01:36:39,853 --> 01:36:41,548
Wanna meet her?

1141
01:36:43,324 --> 01:36:44,518
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1142
01:36:44,692 --> 01:36:45,853
Okay, come on.

1143
01:36:46,028 --> 01:36:49,225
Excuse me. President Roosevelt,
this is my friend Rebecca.

1144
01:36:49,398 --> 01:36:51,026
-An honor.
-Hi.

1145
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,031
And this is Sakagawea.

1146
01:36:53,202 --> 01:36:54,430
-Wea.
-Wea.

1147
01:36:54,604 --> 01:36:56,094
Wea.

1148
01:36:56,273 --> 01:36:59,208
I think she has a few questions
she wants to ask you.

1149
01:37:00,978 --> 01:37:03,209
You rock. I am a big fan.

1150
01:37:04,682 --> 01:37:06,274
What would you like to know?

1151
01:37:07,118 --> 01:37:09,916
Well, I mean,
I don't know where to start, but....

1152
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:23,826
-One Buddha.
-Check.

1153
01:37:25,406 --> 01:37:27,738
Two zebras.

1154
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:31,742
-Right. Check.
-Dexter! Welcome back.

1155
01:37:31,913 --> 01:37:34,781
Hey, Dex, so look.
No hard feelings, all right?

1156
01:37:36,285 --> 01:37:37,844
-Lawrence!
-You saw!

1157
01:37:38,021 --> 01:37:40,285
-You saw what he did just then!
-Who's evolved?

1158
01:37:40,457 --> 01:37:42,255
-I am.
-Who's evolved?

1159
01:37:42,426 --> 01:37:43,791
I am!

1160
01:37:44,829 --> 01:37:46,194
Good.

1161
01:37:46,964 --> 01:37:48,455
Well, they're all here.

1162
01:37:48,632 --> 01:37:50,099
Well done. Everyone's in.

1163
01:37:50,268 --> 01:37:51,929
Yeah, well...

1164
01:37:52,170 --> 01:37:53,899
...not everyone.

1165
01:37:55,074 --> 01:37:58,168
We lost a couple of good, little men
out there tonight.

1166
01:37:58,579 --> 01:38:02,447
With great victory comes great sacrifice.

1167
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:04,975
Yeah.

1168
01:38:07,956 --> 01:38:09,787
Dad, look.

1169
01:38:15,631 --> 01:38:17,565
Bully!

1170
01:38:38,458 --> 01:38:40,824
You ain't getting rid of us that easy.

1171
01:39:01,151 --> 01:39:02,846
Until tomorrow evening, Lawrence?

1172
01:39:03,486 --> 01:39:05,785
Yeah. I don't know about that, Teddy.

1173
01:39:06,524 --> 01:39:08,787
It's gonna be tough
to talk my way out of this one.

1174
01:39:08,959 --> 01:39:11,019
Well, if that's indeed the case...

1175
01:39:11,196 --> 01:39:13,096
...then it's farewell, my friend.

1176
01:39:15,067 --> 01:39:16,728
Nick?

1177
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:19,770
Your father's a great man.

1178
01:39:20,273 --> 01:39:21,865
I know.

1179
01:39:27,681 --> 01:39:29,309
Told you.

1180
01:39:32,787 --> 01:39:34,756
All right. Good night.

1181
01:39:34,923 --> 01:39:37,824
No, Lawrence. Good day.

1182
01:39:42,899 --> 01:39:44,799
Hey, Teddy?

1183
01:39:58,017 --> 01:39:59,609
Thanks.

1184
01:40:13,267 --> 01:40:16,500
You're watching New York 1.
News all morning.

1185
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:20,365
Thanks for joining us.
There is a fresh blanket of snow.

1186
01:40:20,543 --> 01:40:22,944
But it's not the snow
that's got New Yorkers talking.

1187
01:40:23,113 --> 01:40:27,345
It's what's in the snow. There are
dinosaur tracks along West 81st Street.

1188
01:40:27,984 --> 01:40:31,318
Here's the remarkable video. These appear
to be Tyrannosaurus Rex tracks...

1189
01:40:31,489 --> 01:40:34,549
...and they lead straight
to the Museum of Natural History.

1190
01:40:35,027 --> 01:40:39,123
Authorities have found what appear to be
cave drawings in the subway.

1191
01:40:39,298 --> 01:40:42,427
Neanderthals atop the museum roof.
Elaborate hoax or publicity stunt?

1192
01:40:44,003 --> 01:40:45,868
You be the judge,
but one thing's for sure:

1193
01:40:46,039 --> 01:40:49,668
The folks at the Natural History Museum
have really outdone them--

1194
01:40:52,948 --> 01:40:54,209
Any explanation at all?

1195
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:00,181
No. Got nothing.

1196
01:41:00,355 --> 01:41:01,583
Good.

1197
01:41:02,190 --> 01:41:04,853
I'll take your keys and your flashlight.

1198
01:41:22,881 --> 01:41:24,975
Folks, this way.

1199
01:42:22,651 --> 01:42:26,645
My name is Nick Daley.
My Career Day parent is my dad.

1200
01:42:26,823 --> 01:42:29,951
He's the night watchman
at the Museum of Natural History.

1201
01:42:34,999 --> 01:42:36,900
Hey, how's it going? Well, Nicky said it:

1202
01:42:37,069 --> 01:42:39,537
I'm the night watchman
at the Museum of Natural History.

1203
01:42:39,704 --> 01:42:43,665
Let me tell you something:
That's when history comes alive.

1204
01:42:44,943 --> 01:42:47,537
How many of you guys
have been over to the museum?

1205
01:43:08,471 --> 01:43:11,839
Goal!

1206
01:43:38,773 --> 01:43:41,208
Hey, it's getting late.
Are you ready to go home?

1207
01:43:41,743 --> 01:43:42,732
Nope.

1208
01:43:49,252 --> 01:43:50,879
Let's ride.

1209
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:31,696
It was nice of Larry not to rat us out,
but this is ridiculous.

1210
01:44:31,868 --> 01:44:34,894
We're night watchmen, not janitors!

1211
01:44:35,071 --> 01:44:36,869
Gentlemen, you're doing a terrific job.

1212
01:44:37,041 --> 01:44:38,508
I'll gonna catch a few Z's.

1213
01:44:38,676 --> 01:44:40,143
You ain't going nowhere.

1214
01:44:40,311 --> 01:44:42,974
Start mopping, hot dog.

1215
01:44:47,419 --> 01:44:49,081
Over here.

1216
01:44:50,420 --> 01:45:00,508
