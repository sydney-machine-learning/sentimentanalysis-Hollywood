1
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,164
Will!

2
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,668
- Why is this happening?
- I don't know.

3
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:32,130
You look beautiful.

4
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:36,885
And it's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.

5
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,263
Make way! Let me through!
How dare you!

6
00:02:40,388 --> 00:02:43,892
Stand your men down at once.
Do you hear me?

7
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:48,188
Governor Weatherby Swann,
it's been too long.

8
00:02:48,272 --> 00:02:51,859
- Cutler Beckett?
- It's Lord now, actually.

9
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:58,866
Lord or not, you have no reason
and no authority to arrest this man.

10
00:02:59,283 --> 00:03:01,911
In fact, I do. Mr. Mercer?

11
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:07,876
The warrant for the arrest
of one William Turner.

12
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:17,428
- This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.
- Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake.

13
00:03:17,553 --> 00:03:19,930
- Arrest her.
- On what charges?

14
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:23,726
- No!
- Aha. Here's the one for William Turner.

15
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:27,939
And I have another one
for a Mr. James Norrington.

16
00:03:28,022 --> 00:03:30,150
- Is he present?
- What are the charges?

17
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:33,945
Commodore Norrington resigned
his commission some months ago.

18
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,448
I don't believe that was the answer
to the question I asked.

19
00:03:36,573 --> 00:03:40,244
Lord Beckett. In the category
of questions not answered...

20
00:03:40,327 --> 00:03:43,747
We are under the jurisdiction
of the king's governor of Port Royal

21
00:03:43,872 --> 00:03:46,625
and you will tell us
what we are charged with.

22
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:50,004
The charge is "conspiring to set free

23
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:53,758
a man convicted of crimes
against the Crown and Empire

24
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:57,637
and condemned to death,
for which the..."

25
00:03:57,762 --> 00:04:01,433
For which the punishment,
regrettably, is also death.

26
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:07,022
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate
named Jack Sparrow.

27
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,108
Captain.

28
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:12,945
Captain Jack Sparrow.

29
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:15,948
Captain Jack Sparrow.

30
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:18,242
Yes, I thought you might.

31
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:25,250
<i>(man) # Fifteen men
on a dead man's chest</i>

32
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:30,172
# Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

33
00:04:30,297 --> 00:04:35,636
# Drink and the devil
had done for the rest

34
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:40,349
# Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

35
00:04:40,474 --> 00:04:41,851
<i>(laughs)</i>

36
00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:43,895
<i>(bell tolls)</i>

37
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:05,125
Prisoners, come on!

38
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,880
<i>(groaning)</i>

39
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,762
<i>(screams)</i>

40
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:21,101
<i>(screams)</i>

41
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,273
Sorry, mate.

42
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:50,571
Mind if we make a little side trip?

43
00:06:51,405 --> 00:06:53,699
I don't think so.

44
00:06:59,914 --> 00:07:03,835
- Not quite according to plan.
- Complications arose, ensued,

45
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:05,962
were overcome.

46
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,801
- You got what you went in for, then?
- Mm-hm.

47
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:16,348
Captain, I think the crew,
meaning me as well,

48
00:07:16,432 --> 00:07:19,768
were expecting something
a bit more... shiny,

49
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:24,106
with the Isla de Muerta going pear-shaped,
reclaimed by the sea with the treasure.

50
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,734
And the Royal Navy chasing us
around the Atlantic.

51
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:29,529
- And the hurricane.
- (all) Aye.

52
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:35,368
All in all, it seems some time
since we did a speck of honest pirating.

53
00:07:36,578 --> 00:07:39,498
- Shiny.
- Aye, shiny.

54
00:07:40,624 --> 00:07:42,584
Is that how you're all feeling?

55
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:48,048
That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving
your best interests as captain?

56
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:50,426
<i>(squawks) Walk the plank.</i>

57
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:53,554
- What did the bird say?
- Do not blame the bird.

58
00:07:53,638 --> 00:07:56,975
Show us what is on
that piece of cloth there.

59
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,737
- You know that don't do no good.
- (Jack) It does me.

60
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:14,034
- It's a key.
- No. Much more better.

61
00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:18,039
It is a drawing of a key.

62
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,297
Gentlemen,

63
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,300
What do keys do?

64
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,219
Keys...

65
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,680
Unlock things?

66
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:37,601
And whatever this key unlocks,
inside there's something valuable.

67
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:40,938
So we're setting out to find
whatever this key unlocks.

68
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,648
No.

69
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,111
If we don't have the key, we can't open
whatever we don't have that it unlocks.

70
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:51,032
So what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,

71
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:55,620
which we don't have, without first
having found the key what unlocks it?

72
00:08:55,704 --> 00:08:57,998
So we're going after this key.

73
00:08:58,957 --> 00:09:01,418
You're not making any sense at all.

74
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,921
Any more questions?

75
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:06,549
So... do we have a heading?

76
00:09:06,632 --> 00:09:08,759
Ha! A heading.

77
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:13,181
Set sail in a...

78
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:16,225
general...

79
00:09:20,981 --> 00:09:22,858
that-way direction.

80
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:24,109
Captain?

81
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:28,906
Come on, snap to and make sail. You
know how this works. Go on. Oi, oi, oi!

82
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:34,745
Have you noticed lately,

83
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,500
the captain seems to be acting
a bit strange... er?

84
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:42,378
Setting sail without knowing
his own heading.

85
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:45,465
Something's got Jack vexed,
and mark my words,

86
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:49,386
what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow
bodes ill for us all.

87
00:10:03,693 --> 00:10:06,154
(Man) Lord Beckett,
the prisoner as ordered, sir.

88
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,573
Those won't be necessary.

89
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:17,124
The East India Trading Company
has need of your services.

90
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:23,213
We wish for you to act as our agent

91
00:10:23,297 --> 00:10:27,426
in a business transaction
with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow.

92
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,887
More acquaintance.
How do you know him?

93
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:32,890
(Beckett) We've had dealings in the past.

94
00:10:33,808 --> 00:10:37,478
And we've each
left our mark on the other.

95
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,981
What mark did he leave on you?

96
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:46,405
By your efforts,
Jack Sparrow was set free.

97
00:10:46,488 --> 00:10:48,532
I would like you to go to him

98
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:53,162
and recover a certain property
in his possession.

99
00:10:53,245 --> 00:10:55,998
Recover. At the point of a sword?

100
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:58,543
Bargain.

101
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:06,968
Letters of marque.

102
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:10,806
You will offer what
amounts to a full pardon.

103
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:15,185
Jack will be free,
a privateer in the employ of England.

104
00:11:15,894 --> 00:11:20,691
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider
employment the same as being free.

105
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:22,860
Freedom.

106
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:27,156
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

107
00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:29,158
The world is shrinking,

108
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:32,662
the blank edges of the map filled in.

109
00:11:32,746 --> 00:11:36,583
Jack must find his place
in the New World or perish.

110
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:39,461
Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.

111
00:11:39,586 --> 00:11:42,422
You and your fiancÃ©e
face the hangman's noose.

112
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:47,845
- So you get Jack and the Black Pearl.
- The Black Pearl?

113
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,183
- The property you want that he possesses.
- A ship? Hardly.

114
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:56,312
The item in question is considerably
smaller and far more valuable,

115
00:11:56,437 --> 00:12:00,024
something Sparrow keeps
on his person at all times.

116
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:02,736
A compass?

117
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:04,946
Ah, you know it.

118
00:12:06,323 --> 00:12:10,703
Bring back that compass
or there's no deal.

119
00:12:36,104 --> 00:12:38,399
Why is the rum always gone?

120
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:46,866
Oh.

121
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:49,535
That's why.

122
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:51,621
<i>(snoring)</i>

123
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:57,544
As you were, gents.

124
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:30,746
Ah.

125
00:13:32,748 --> 00:13:34,625
<i>(man) Time's run out, Jack.</i>

126
00:13:53,186 --> 00:13:55,814
Bootstrap.

127
00:13:55,898 --> 00:13:58,025
Bill Turner.

128
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:05,199
You look good, Jack.

129
00:14:11,956 --> 00:14:14,167
Is this a dream?

130
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,627
No.

131
00:14:15,752 --> 00:14:19,339
I thought not.
If it were, there'd be rum.

132
00:14:27,223 --> 00:14:29,683
You got the Pearl back, I see.

133
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:34,272
I had some help retrieving
the Pearl,by the way.

134
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:37,859
Your son.

135
00:14:37,984 --> 00:14:40,445
William?

136
00:14:41,196 --> 00:14:43,573
He ended up a pirate after all.

137
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:48,370
And to what do I owe
the pleasure of your carbuncle?

138
00:14:48,495 --> 00:14:50,622
He sent me.

139
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:54,668
Davy Jones.

140
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:57,296
Oh.

141
00:14:57,421 --> 00:14:59,382
So it's you, then.

142
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:04,345
He shanghaied you
into service, eh?

143
00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:06,389
I chose it.

144
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:11,478
I'm sorry for the part I played
in the mutiny against you, Jack.

145
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,856
I stood up for you.

146
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,860
Everything went wrong after that.

147
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:24,325
They strapped me to a cannon.
I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,

148
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:27,370
the weight of the water
crushing down on me.

149
00:15:27,453 --> 00:15:29,998
Unable to move.

150
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:33,334
Unable to die, Jack.

151
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:39,007
And I thought that even the tiniest hope
of escaping this fate, I would take it.

152
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:41,802
I would trade anything for it.

153
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:47,099
It's funny what a man will do
to forestall his final judgment.

154
00:15:47,224 --> 00:15:49,894
You made a deal with him too, Jack.

155
00:15:49,977 --> 00:15:52,605
He raised the Pearl
from the depths for you.

156
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:54,732
13 years, you've been her captain.

157
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:56,734
- Technically...
- Jack.

158
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:59,237
You won't be able
to talk yourself out of this.

159
00:15:59,362 --> 00:16:02,115
The terms what applied to me
apply to you as well.

160
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:06,495
One soul bound to crew
100 years upon his ship.

161
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,997
Yes, with the Flying Dutchman
already has a captain...

162
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:11,417
Then it's the locker for you!

163
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:14,712
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you

164
00:16:14,837 --> 00:16:19,133
and drag the Pearl back to the depths
and you along with it.

165
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:24,639
Any idea when Jones might release
said terrible beastie?

166
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,517
I already told you, Jack.

167
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,813
Your time is up.

168
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:34,775
It comes now,

169
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:40,197
drawn with ravenous hunger
to the man what bears the black spot.

170
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:52,585
On deck, all hands!
Make fast the bunt gasket!

171
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:54,963
On deck! Scurry!

172
00:16:55,046 --> 00:16:59,593
Scurry! I want movement!
Movement! I want movement!

173
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:03,472
Lift the skin up! Keep your loof!
Haul those sheets!

174
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:07,935
Run them! Run! Keep running! Run as if
the devil himself and itself is upon us!

- Argh! Run! Land.

- I didn't say "port", I said "land". Any land.

- (Jack) No, no!

178

Leave it!

179

Run.

- Shh.

For the love of mother and child, Jack,
what's coming after us?

183
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:56,862
Nothing.

Jack's compass?
What does Beckett want with that?

192
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:29,544
Does it matter? I'm to find Jack
and convince him to return to Port Royal.

193

In exchange, the charges
against us will be dropped.

No. We must find our own avenue
to secure your freedom.

195
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,553
Is that a lack of faith in Jack
or in me?

196

That you would risk your life
to save Sparrow

197
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:44,935

he would do the same for anyone else.

Owes me four doubloons.
Heard he was dead.

Singapore. That's what I heard.
Drunk, with a smile on his face.

- C'est trop dangereux.

- Do explain.

I have been to the Isla de Muerta.
I have seen the treasure myself.

Ah, I see.

304
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:09,118
You think the compass
leads only to the Isla de Muerta

305
00:29:09,243 --> 00:29:12,413
and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate.

306

But you mustn't worry.

307
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:19,462
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.

My desires are not so provincial.

Since we're not immortal no more.
We gotta take care of our immortal souls.

00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,296
Thank you.

349
00:32:53,147 --> 00:32:56,401
Why would he do this to us?
If Jack is the chief...

350
00:32:56,526 --> 00:32:58,987
Aye, the Pelegostos
made Jack their chief,

351
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:02,657
but he only remains chief
as long as he acts like a chief.

352
00:33:02,741 --> 00:33:05,827
So he had no choice.
He's a captive as much as the rest of us.

353
00:33:05,953 --> 00:33:12,668
Worse, as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos
believe that Jack is a god in human form,

354
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:18,841
and they intend to do him the honor
of releasing him from his fleshy prison.

355
00:33:18,966 --> 00:33:20,927
<i>(yelps)</i>

356
00:33:22,387 --> 00:33:24,848
They'll roast him and eat him.

357
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,684
Where's the rest of the crew?

358
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:32,314
These cages we're in
weren't built till after we got here.

359
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,860
The feast is about to begin.

360
00:33:37,444 --> 00:33:39,655
Jack's life will end

361
00:33:39,738 --> 00:33:42,033
when the drums stop.

362
00:33:43,784 --> 00:33:46,412
Well, we can't just sit here and wait,
then, can we?

363
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:51,501
No, no. Oi! No, no.

364
00:33:51,584 --> 00:33:54,671
More wood. Big fire. Big fire.

365
00:33:54,796 --> 00:33:56,923
I am Chief. Want big fire.

366
00:33:57,007 --> 00:33:59,218
Come on.

367
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,638
<i>Oi. (cannibals' language)
Tout de suite.</i>

368
00:34:02,721 --> 00:34:05,015
Come on. More wood.

369
00:34:32,002 --> 00:34:33,963
Whoa!

370
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:15,465
Oh, bugger.

371
00:35:25,184 --> 00:35:27,311
A little seasoning, eh?

372
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,786
Well done.

373
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:25,456
Put your legs through.
Start to climb!

374
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:30,712
Come on, men!
It'll take all of us to crew the Black Pearl!

375
00:36:30,795 --> 00:36:33,548
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.

376
00:36:33,632 --> 00:36:35,926
About six would do.

377
00:36:39,554 --> 00:36:41,348
Oh, dear.

378
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:47,480
- Hurry!
- Come on!

379
00:36:51,234 --> 00:36:53,611
Come on! Is that all you got?

380
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:03,830
- Wait. Stop.
- Eh?

381
00:37:04,331 --> 00:37:06,625
Stop. Shh.

382
00:37:13,841 --> 00:37:15,801
Shh.

383
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:21,099
- (Marty) What are they doing?
- Stop.

384
00:37:27,856 --> 00:37:30,400
- Snake!
- (screaming)

385
00:37:47,043 --> 00:37:48,836

No, no. Oi! No, no!

390
00:38:27,419 --> 00:38:29,046
Not good.

391
00:38:45,355 --> 00:38:47,565
Cut it loose! Find a rock!

The mooring line!

Thief! Little hairy thief!
Give it back!

00:42:57,915 --> 00:43:00,042
He's got me eye.
He won't give it back.

414
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:03,546
- How'd you get it back last time?
- Excellent! Our work's half done.

415
00:43:03,671 --> 00:43:06,132
We done it for you,
knowing you'd be coming back.

416
00:43:06,257 --> 00:43:09,177
- Make ready to sail, boys!
- What about Jack?

417
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,597
- I won't leave without him.
- (Jack) Oi!

418
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,734
- Time to go.
- Cast off those lines!

00:43:29,156 --> 00:43:32,076
Aaargh!

420
00:43:32,493 --> 00:43:35,496
- Make ready to cast off!
- Oi!

421
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:41,419
Good doggy.

422
00:43:56,811 --> 00:44:03,151
Alas, my children, this is the day you shall
always remember as the day you almost...

423
00:44:06,237 --> 00:44:08,448
Captain Jack Sparrow.

424
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,910
<i>(dog barks)</i>

425
00:44:34,225 --> 00:44:37,312
Let's get away from this island
and head out to open sea.

426
00:44:37,395 --> 00:44:41,858
Yes to the first. Yes to the second, but
only insofar as we keep to the shallows.

427
00:44:41,984 --> 00:44:44,111
That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.

428
00:44:44,194 --> 00:44:47,364
I have faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills.

429
00:44:47,448 --> 00:44:50,534
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.

430
00:44:56,207 --> 00:44:58,585
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.

431
00:44:58,668 --> 00:45:01,421
Have you considered
just locking her up somewhere?

432
00:45:01,546 --> 00:45:04,090
She is locked up,
bound to hang for helping you.

433
00:45:04,174 --> 00:45:09,137
There comes a time when one must
take responsibility for one's mistakes.

434
00:45:10,431 --> 00:45:12,808
I need that compass of yours, Jack.

435
00:45:12,933 --> 00:45:15,478
I must trade it for her freedom.

436
00:45:17,813 --> 00:45:20,483
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Captain.

437
00:45:20,566 --> 00:45:23,569
We have a need to travel upriver.

438
00:45:23,695 --> 00:45:27,198
By need, do you mean a trifling need?

439
00:45:27,282 --> 00:45:31,036
Fleeting?
As in, say, a passing fancy?

440
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:34,915
No, a resolute and unyielding need.

441
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,794
What we need to do
is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.

442
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:40,796
William,

443
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:42,965
I shall trade you the compass

444
00:45:43,048 --> 00:45:44,842
if you will help me

445
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:47,094
to find this.

446
00:45:50,807 --> 00:45:53,268
- You want me to find this?
- No.

447
00:45:54,436 --> 00:45:56,897
You want you to find this,

448
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:01,068
because the finding of this
finds you incapacitorially finding

449
00:46:01,151 --> 00:46:07,867
and/or locating in your discovering a way
to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face.

450
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,786
Savvy?

451
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,874
This is going to save Elizabeth?

452
00:46:17,168 --> 00:46:20,255
How much do you know
about Davy Jones?

453
00:46:22,465 --> 00:46:24,009
Not much.

454
00:46:24,134 --> 00:46:27,137
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.

455
00:46:49,244 --> 00:46:51,204
<i>(arguing)</i>

456
00:46:53,457 --> 00:46:56,126
What's all this?

457
00:46:56,668 --> 00:47:01,715
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have
to share and wear it one after the other.

458
00:47:01,799 --> 00:47:05,136
It's not like that, sir.
This ship is haunted.

459
00:47:05,678 --> 00:47:07,972
Is it, now? And you?

460
00:47:08,055 --> 00:47:12,185
There's a female presence
amongst us here, sir.

461
00:47:12,268 --> 00:47:14,729
All the men, they can feel it.

462
00:47:14,854 --> 00:47:18,608
It's the ghost of a lady widowed
before her marriage, I figure it,

463
00:47:18,692 --> 00:47:20,986
searching for her husband,
lost at sea.

464
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:23,614
A virgin too, likely as not.

465
00:47:23,739 --> 00:47:25,949
And that bodes ill by all accounts.

466
00:47:26,075 --> 00:47:30,538
I say that we throw the dress overboard
and we hope the spirit follows it.

467
00:47:30,663 --> 00:47:33,499
No! That will just anger the spirit, sir.

468
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:37,629
What we need to do is find out what
the spirit needs, and then get it back to her.

469
00:47:37,712 --> 00:47:39,923
Enough! Enough!

470
00:47:40,048 --> 00:47:44,344
You're a pair of superstitious goats
and it's got the best of you.

471
00:47:44,427 --> 00:47:47,597
Now, this appears to be no more
as we have a stowaway on board.

472
00:47:47,723 --> 00:47:49,850
A young woman, by the look of it.

473
00:47:49,975 --> 00:47:52,603
I want you to search the ship
and find her.

474
00:47:52,686 --> 00:47:55,439
Oh, and, er... she's probably naked.

475
00:48:25,346 --> 00:48:27,974
(Will)
- Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?

476
00:48:28,057 --> 00:48:30,435
Well, if you believe such things,

477
00:48:30,935 --> 00:48:33,730
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones,

478
00:48:33,813 --> 00:48:38,360
A fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off

479
00:48:38,485 --> 00:48:42,072
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.

480
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,868
The Kraken.

481
00:48:48,162 --> 00:48:52,083
They say the stench of its breath is like...
(shudders)

482
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:55,670
Imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth

483
00:48:55,753 --> 00:49:01,676
is the roar of the kraken and the reeking
odor of a thousand rotting corpses.

484
00:49:03,595 --> 00:49:06,056
If you believe such things.

485
00:49:06,598 --> 00:49:08,976
And the key will spare him that?

486
00:49:09,101 --> 00:49:12,604
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.

487
00:49:12,688 --> 00:49:15,149
Bad enough even to go visit...

488
00:49:16,108 --> 00:49:18,235
her.

489
00:49:18,361 --> 00:49:20,238
Her?

490
00:49:20,321 --> 00:49:22,281
Aye.

491
00:49:57,319 --> 00:50:00,989
No worries, mates.
Tia Dalma and I go way back.

492
00:50:01,114 --> 00:50:05,035
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable, we are.

493
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,454
Were. Have been.

494
00:50:08,664 --> 00:50:09,665
Before.

495
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,752
- I'll watch your back.
- It's me front I'm worried about.

496
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:15,296
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

497
00:50:16,172 --> 00:50:18,716
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.

498
00:50:18,841 --> 00:50:20,885
- Mind the boat.

499
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:23,138
Mind the boat.

500
00:50:34,942 --> 00:50:38,195
Jack Sparrow.

501
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,448
Tia Dalma.

502
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:45,787
I always knew the wind was going
to blow you back to me one day.

503
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,461
You...

504
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,466
You have a touch of...

505
00:50:57,591 --> 00:51:00,928
destiny about you,

506
00:51:01,053 --> 00:51:02,930
William Turner.

507
00:51:04,682 --> 00:51:06,809
You know me?

508
00:51:06,934 --> 00:51:09,520
You want to know me.

509
00:51:09,645 --> 00:51:14,275
There'll be no knowing here. We've come
for help and we're not leaving without it.

510
00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:17,988
- I thought I knew you.
- Not so well as I had hoped.

511
00:51:18,113 --> 00:51:20,240
- Come.
- Come.

512
00:51:23,994 --> 00:51:28,457
What service may I do you?

513
00:51:29,208 --> 00:51:33,129
- You know I demand payment.
- I brought payment. (whistles)

514
00:51:36,758 --> 00:51:38,718
Look.

515
00:51:39,928 --> 00:51:42,305
An undead monkey.

516
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:44,558
Top that.

517
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,399
Don't! You've no idea
how long it took us to catch that.

518
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,361
The payment is fair.

519
00:51:55,486 --> 00:51:57,446
We're looking for this.

520
00:52:00,032 --> 00:52:02,869
And what it goes to.

521
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:08,958
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?

522
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:12,462
Maybe. Why?

523
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,881
I hear you.

524
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:19,470
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.

525
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,348
Or do you know,

526
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:26,352
but are loath to claim it as your own?

527
00:52:28,104 --> 00:52:30,148
Your key go to a chest.

528
00:52:30,732 --> 00:52:35,278
And it is what lay inside the chest
you seek, don't it?

529
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:38,281
- What is inside?
- Gold?

530
00:52:38,365 --> 00:52:42,411
Jewels? Unclaimed properties
of a valuable nature?

531
00:52:42,536 --> 00:52:45,706
Nothing bad, I hope?

532
00:52:46,457 --> 00:52:49,293
You know of Davy Jones,

533
00:52:49,418 --> 00:52:50,961
yes?

534
00:52:51,045 --> 00:52:53,798
A man of the sea.

535
00:52:53,923 --> 00:52:56,175
A great sailor,

536
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:01,264
until he run afoul of that
which vex all men.

537
00:53:01,389 --> 00:53:04,392
What vexes all men?

538
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:08,397
What indeed?

539
00:53:08,981 --> 00:53:10,941
- The sea.
- Sums.

540
00:53:11,066 --> 00:53:14,069
The dichotomy of good and evil.

541
00:53:14,695 --> 00:53:16,405
A woman.

542
00:53:16,697 --> 00:53:18,324
A woman.

543
00:53:18,407 --> 00:53:20,451
He fell in love.

544
00:53:20,576 --> 00:53:23,496
No, no, no, no.
I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.

545
00:53:23,621 --> 00:53:27,542
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.

546
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:30,003
See, it was a woman

547
00:53:30,128 --> 00:53:32,881
as changing and harsh

548
00:53:32,964 --> 00:53:36,385
and untamable as the sea.

549
00:53:36,468 --> 00:53:38,846
Him never stopped loving her.

550
00:53:38,971 --> 00:53:43,726
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with

551
00:53:43,851 --> 00:53:46,520
but not enough to cause him to die.

552
00:53:48,314 --> 00:53:52,777
What exactly did he put
into the chest?

553
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,821
Him heart.

554
00:53:54,904 --> 00:53:56,948
Literally or figuratively?

555
00:53:57,073 --> 00:54:01,620
He couldn't literally
put his heart in a chest.

556
00:54:01,703 --> 00:54:03,664
Could he?

557
00:54:03,789 --> 00:54:09,837
It was not worth feeling
what small, fleeting joy life brings.

558
00:54:09,962 --> 00:54:11,589
And so...

559
00:54:11,714 --> 00:54:14,383
him carve out him heart,

560
00:54:15,009 --> 00:54:19,681
lock it away in a chest
and hide the chest from the world.

561
00:54:20,598 --> 00:54:22,642
The key

562
00:54:22,767 --> 00:54:27,314
he keep with him at all times.

563
00:54:27,939 --> 00:54:31,610
- You knew this.
- I did not. I didn't know where the key was.

564
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:35,948
But now we do. All that's left is to climb
aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key,

565
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:38,784
you go back to Port Royal
and save your bonnie lass, eh?

566
00:54:38,868 --> 00:54:41,704
Let me see your hand.

567
00:54:55,302 --> 00:54:57,763
(Gibbs gasps)
The black spot!

568
00:54:58,847 --> 00:55:02,351
- (Ragetti moans) The black spot!
- (Pintel) Black spot!

569
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:05,896
My eyesight's as good as ever,
just so you know.

570
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:09,400
(Tia Dalma) I have just the
thing. Now, where did I put it?

571
00:55:09,525 --> 00:55:12,111
<i>(clattering)</i>

572
00:55:12,904 --> 00:55:16,408
My little beauty, where are you?

573
00:55:16,491 --> 00:55:19,995
Such a long time in such a mess.

574
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,917
Davy Jones cannot make port.

575
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:28,379
Cannot step on land
but once every ten years.

576
00:55:28,921 --> 00:55:32,174
Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow,

577
00:55:32,258 --> 00:55:34,760
and so you will carry land with you.

578
00:55:44,062 --> 00:55:46,022
Dirt.

579
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:50,819
- This is a jar of dirt.
- Yes.

580
00:55:53,197 --> 00:55:56,033
Is the jar of dirt going to help?

581
00:55:56,158 --> 00:55:59,078
If you don't want it, give it back.

582
00:55:59,578 --> 00:56:02,748
- No.
- Then it helps.

583
00:56:04,959 --> 00:56:09,964
It seems we have a need to find
the Flying Dutchman.

584
00:56:13,134 --> 00:56:16,930
A touch of destiny.

585
00:56:32,447 --> 00:56:34,949
That's the Flying Dutchman?

586
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:39,663
- She doesn't look like much.
- Neither do you.

587
00:56:39,788 --> 00:56:42,082
Do not underestimate her.

588
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:47,963
- Must have run afoul of the reef.
- So, what's your plan, then?

589
00:56:48,088 --> 00:56:51,509
I row over, search the ship
until I find your bloody key.

590
00:56:51,634 --> 00:56:53,970
And if there are crewmen?

591
00:56:54,095 --> 00:56:56,305
I cut down anyone in my path.

592
00:56:57,181 --> 00:57:00,101
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

593
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:04,314
(Ragetti) Your chariot awaits you, Sire.
(cackles)

594
00:57:06,441 --> 00:57:07,567
Oi!

595
00:57:07,692 --> 00:57:13,449
If you do happen to get captured, just say
Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt.

596
00:57:13,532 --> 00:57:17,411
- It might save your life.
- (Ragetti) Bon voyage!

597
00:57:21,415 --> 00:57:23,960
Douse the lamps.

598
00:58:03,001 --> 00:58:05,546
<i>(mutters)</i>

599
00:58:05,671 --> 00:58:06,713
Sailor.

600
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,383
- Hoisting the jib, Captain's orders.
- Sailor!

601
00:58:09,508 --> 00:58:11,844
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up with a round turn.

602
00:58:11,969 --> 00:58:14,639
There's no use.
You've run aground.

603
00:58:14,764 --> 00:58:16,140
No.

604
00:58:16,224 --> 00:58:18,351
Beneath us.

605
00:58:19,227 --> 00:58:21,604
Foul breath.

606
00:58:21,729 --> 00:58:23,773

Get back! Get back!

Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.

Do you fear death?

616
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:37,707
Do you fear that dark abyss?

617
01:00:39,626 --> 01:00:42,462
All your deeds laid bare.

618
01:00:43,338 --> 01:00:46,341
All your sins punished.

619
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:50,638
I can offer you

620
01:00:50,763 --> 01:00:53,182
an escape.

Do you not fear death?

623
01:01:10,492 --> 01:01:13,036
I'll take my chances, sir.

624
01:01:13,162 --> 01:01:15,539
To the depths.

625
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:23,047
Cruel blackguard!

626
01:01:23,172 --> 01:01:25,299
Life is cruel.

627
01:01:26,259 --> 01:01:29,012
Why should the afterlife
be any different?

628
01:01:29,554 --> 01:01:32,724
I offer you a choice.

629
01:01:32,807 --> 01:01:35,477
Join my crew

630
01:01:35,602 --> 01:01:37,896
and postpone the judgment.

631
01:01:39,356 --> 01:01:42,818
One hundred years before the mast.

632
01:01:45,154 --> 01:01:47,114
Will ye serve?

633
01:01:48,908 --> 01:01:50,868
I- I will serve.

634
01:01:50,993 --> 01:01:53,371
There.

635
01:01:53,496 --> 01:01:55,498
<i>(laughter)</i>

636
01:02:00,295 --> 01:02:03,757
You are neither dead nor dying.

637
01:02:03,882 --> 01:02:06,468
What is your purpose here?

638
01:02:09,305 --> 01:02:12,475
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.

639
01:02:13,601 --> 01:02:16,854
What is your purpose here?

640
01:02:16,938 --> 01:02:20,108
Jack Sparrow
sent me to settle his debt.

641
01:02:23,111 --> 01:02:25,655
Did he, now?

642
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:29,201
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

643
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,713
<i>(frightened gasps)</i>

644
01:02:44,675 --> 01:02:45,676
Oh.

645
01:02:46,135 --> 01:02:48,972
You have a debt to pay.

646
01:02:49,055 --> 01:02:52,475
You've been captain of the Black Pearl
for 13 years.

647
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,603
That was our agreement.

648
01:02:54,728 --> 01:02:58,523
Technically I was only captain
for two years, then I was mutinied upon.

649
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:02,403
Then you were a poor captain,
but a captain nonetheless.

650
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:05,781
Have you not introduced yourself
all these years

651
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:08,409
as Captain Jack Sparrow?

652
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:10,745
<i>(laughter)</i>

653
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:14,332
You have my payment.
One soul to serve on your ship.

654
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:17,711
- One soul is not equal to another.
- Aha!

655
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:24,301
We've established my proposal is sound
in principle. Now we're haggling over price.

656
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:26,970
Price?

657
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:32,518
Just how many souls
do you think my soul is worth?

658
01:03:36,272 --> 01:03:38,941
One hundred souls.

659
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:41,653
Three days.

660
01:03:42,153 --> 01:03:45,991
You're a diamond, mate. Send me back
the boy. I'll get started right off.

661
01:03:46,116 --> 01:03:49,202
I keep the boy.
A good-faith payment.

662
01:03:49,327 --> 01:03:53,290
That leaves you only 99 more to go.
(laughs)

663
01:03:55,042 --> 01:03:57,002
Have you not met Will Turner?

664
01:03:57,127 --> 01:03:59,964
He's noble, heroic,
a terrific soprano.

665
01:04:00,047 --> 01:04:02,383
Worth at least four.

666
01:04:02,508 --> 01:04:04,719
Maybe three and a half.

667
01:04:05,553 --> 01:04:08,556
And did I happen to mention...

668
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,059
he's in love?

669
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:14,521
With a girl.

670
01:04:14,646 --> 01:04:17,024
Due to be married.

671
01:04:17,149 --> 01:04:19,109
Betrothed.

672
01:04:20,068 --> 01:04:24,740
Dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel

673
01:04:24,865 --> 01:04:28,828
as actually allowing them
to be joined in holy matrimony.

674
01:04:28,953 --> 01:04:30,913
Eh?

675
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:38,588
I keep the boy. 99 souls.

676
01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:41,341
But I wonder, Sparrow,

677
01:04:41,424 --> 01:04:43,635
can you live with this?

678
01:04:44,386 --> 01:04:48,182
Can you condemn an innocent man,
a friend,

679
01:04:48,307 --> 01:04:53,229
to a lifetime of servitude in your name
while you roam free?

680
01:04:56,482 --> 01:04:58,526
Yep. I'm good with it.

681
01:04:58,609 --> 01:05:01,779
Shall we seal it in blood?
I mean... ink.

682
01:05:02,488 --> 01:05:04,449
<i>(gasps)</i>

683
01:05:06,076 --> 01:05:08,829

- Er, Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye.

686

I- I feel sullied and unusual.

687
01:05:28,808 --> 01:05:34,564
And how do you intend to harvest
these 99 souls in three days?

688
01:05:34,689 --> 01:05:39,403
Fortunately, he was mum as to
the condition in which these souls need be.

Ah.

690
01:05:40,821 --> 01:05:42,781
Tortuga.

691
01:05:43,866 --> 01:05:45,326
Tortuga.

692
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:52,917
It's an outrage.
Port tariffs, berthing fees,

693
01:05:53,042 --> 01:05:56,296
wharf handling
and, heaven help us, pilotage.

694
01:05:56,379 --> 01:06:00,759
Are we all to work for
the East India Trading Company, then?

695
01:06:00,842 --> 01:06:05,305
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is
the only free port left in these waters.

A pirate port is what you mean.
Well, I'm sorry.

An honest sailor is what I am. I make
my living fair and I sleep well each night.

(Bursar) She wants you
to do something.

701
01:06:45,139 --> 01:06:47,809
She's trying to give a sign.

702
01:06:51,855 --> 01:06:53,315
Whoa!

703
01:06:56,193 --> 01:06:58,654
Over there! Look for a sign!

01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:05,578
Look, there! There it is!

706
01:07:06,078 --> 01:07:08,622
- There's the sign!
- That's seaweed.

707
01:07:08,748 --> 01:07:11,834
- Seaweed can be a sign.
- Looks like entrails.

708
01:07:11,918 --> 01:07:16,965
- That would be a bad sign.
- (Deep voice) What's that over there?

709
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:38,488
And what makes you think
you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?

710
01:07:38,613 --> 01:07:40,823
I've never sailed a day in me life.

711
01:07:40,948 --> 01:07:44,118
I figure I should get out,
see the world while I'm still young.

712
01:07:44,202 --> 01:07:47,539
You'll do. Make your mark.
Next!

713
01:07:47,664 --> 01:07:50,333
My wife ran off with my dog

714
01:07:50,792 --> 01:07:53,211
and I'm drunk for a month

715
01:07:53,337 --> 01:07:55,380
and I don't give an ass rat's

716
01:07:55,506 --> 01:07:57,466
if I live or die.

717
01:07:57,549 --> 01:08:00,553
- Perfect. Next!
- I know what I want. I know what I want...

718
01:08:00,678 --> 01:08:04,807
- Me have one arm and a bum leg.
- It's the crow's nest for you.

719
01:08:04,891 --> 01:08:07,018
- I know what I want.
- (Gibbs) Next!

720
01:08:07,143 --> 01:08:12,732
Ever since I was a little lad, I've always
wanted to sail the seas... forever.

721
01:08:12,857 --> 01:08:15,527
Sooner than you think.
Sign the roster.

722
01:08:15,652 --> 01:08:17,904
Thanks very much.

723
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:23,160
- (Jack) How we going?
- Including those four, that gives us... four.

724
01:08:26,664 --> 01:08:28,791
And what's your story?

725
01:08:28,916 --> 01:08:31,377
(Norrington)
My story.

726
01:08:31,502 --> 01:08:36,549
It's exactly the same as your story,
just one chapter behind.

727
01:08:36,674 --> 01:08:40,261
I chased a man
across the seven seas.

728
01:08:40,387 --> 01:08:43,223
The pursuit cost me my crew,

729
01:08:43,306 --> 01:08:45,976
my commission,

730
01:08:46,059 --> 01:08:48,187
and my life.

731
01:08:53,275 --> 01:08:58,072
- Commodore?
- No, not any more. Weren't you listening?

732
01:09:01,117 --> 01:09:03,661
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.

733
01:09:04,454 --> 01:09:09,000
I would have,
if not for the hurricane.

734
01:09:09,084 --> 01:09:10,460
Lord.

735
01:09:10,544 --> 01:09:12,504
You didn't try to sail through it?

736
01:09:12,629 --> 01:09:15,132
So, do I make your crew

737
01:09:15,257 --> 01:09:17,217
or not?

738
01:09:18,093 --> 01:09:20,846
You haven't said where you're going.

739
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:22,974
Somewhere nice?!

740
01:09:24,058 --> 01:09:26,436
So, am I worthy to serve

741
01:09:26,561 --> 01:09:29,314
under Captain Jack Sparrow?

742
01:09:31,816 --> 01:09:35,237
Or should I just kill you now?

743
01:09:41,368 --> 01:09:43,495
You're hired.

744
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:47,583
Sorry. Old habits and all that.

745
01:09:47,708 --> 01:09:51,212
- Easy, sailor!
- That's our captain you're threatening.

- Aye!

748
01:10:51,067 --> 01:10:54,154
- Thanks, mate.
- Aargh!

749
01:10:58,784 --> 01:11:00,661
Carry on.

750
01:11:08,002 --> 01:11:10,546
Come on, then! Who wants some?

751
01:11:10,671 --> 01:11:14,175
Form an orderly line
and I'll have you all, one by one.

Come on, who's first?

I just wanted the pleasure
of doing that myself.

773
01:13:37,452 --> 01:13:42,666
And what would prompt
such an act of charity?

774
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:48,380
My son.

01:13:53,302 --> 01:13:55,596

So I'm to understand
what you did was an act of compassion?

790
01:15:42,502 --> 01:15:44,629
Yes.

Not until your debt is paid.

795
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:11,950
I've sworn no oath.

01:16:13,701 --> 01:16:15,829
You must get away.

The key.

The dead man's chest.

What do you know of this?

801
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:40,271
Open the chest with the key,
and stab the heart...

802
01:16:40,397 --> 01:16:43,483
No, don't stab the heart.

803
01:16:43,608 --> 01:16:48,614
The Dutchman needs a living heart
or there'll be no captain,

804
01:16:48,739 --> 01:16:53,035
and if there's no captain,
there's no one to have the key.

805
01:16:53,452 --> 01:16:55,996
So the captain has the key?

806
01:16:57,248 --> 01:17:00,001
- Where is the key?
- Hidden.

807
01:17:00,418 --> 01:17:03,171
- Where is the chest?
- Hidden.

Hide the rum.

These clothes do not flatter you.
It should be a dress or nothing.

- I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
- Jack.

I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?

Is that what you really want most?

830
01:18:26,384 --> 01:18:28,720
Of course.

Because I would think you'd want to find
a way to save Will most.

832
01:18:33,725 --> 01:18:37,563
- And you'd have a way of doing that?
- Well...

833
01:18:37,688 --> 01:18:40,941
- ...there is a chest.
- Oh, dear.

834
01:18:41,025 --> 01:18:43,319
A chest of unknown size and origin.

835
01:18:43,444 --> 01:18:48,324
What contains
the still-beating heart of Davy Jones.

to do whatever it is he or she wants,

including saving brave William
from his grim fate.

You don't actually believe him, do you?

840
01:19:09,096 --> 01:19:11,390
How would we find it?

01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,439

is to find the chest of Davy Jones,
is it not?

852
01:19:56,396 --> 01:20:01,318
- To save Will.
- By finding the chest of Davy Jones.

- Cap'n.

- We have our heading.
- Finally!

01:20:21,173 --> 01:20:25,761
Cast off those lines.
Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!

Welcome to the crew,
former commodore.

There's something to knowing the exact
shape of the world and one's place in it.

I assure you, these are not necessary.

860
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:52,373
I thought you'd be interested
in the whereabouts of your daughter.

- You have news of her?
- Most recently seen on Tortuga,

862
01:20:56,043 --> 01:21:00,006
and then left in the company
of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow,

863
01:21:00,089 --> 01:21:03,009

"Justice"? Hardly.

Including the previous owner of this sword,
I believe.

866
01:21:11,309 --> 01:21:16,064
Our ships are in pursuit. Justice will
be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass,

867
01:21:16,148 --> 01:21:20,110
and all manner
of remorseless pieces of metal.

868
01:21:20,194 --> 01:21:26,200

01:21:31,414 --> 01:21:34,584
Your authority as governor,
your influence in London,

871
01:21:34,667 --> 01:21:38,255
and your loyalty
to the East India Trading Company.

872
01:21:39,297 --> 01:21:41,842
To you, you mean.

873
01:21:45,471 --> 01:21:48,224
Shall I remove these shackles?

874
01:21:51,435 --> 01:21:54,856
Do what you can for my daughter.

875
01:22:01,112 --> 01:22:06,076
(Beckett) So you see, Mercer, every man
has a price he will willingly accept.

876
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:10,038
Even for what he hoped never to sell.

877
01:22:15,711 --> 01:22:18,839
I wager... ten years.

878
01:22:19,715 --> 01:22:22,051
I'll match ten years.

879
01:22:23,052 --> 01:22:24,762
Agreed.

880
01:22:27,766 --> 01:22:30,518
Wondering how it's played?

881
01:22:30,602 --> 01:22:32,479
- I understand.
- Liar!

882
01:22:32,562 --> 01:22:38,152
(Will) It's a game of deception. But your
bet includes all the dice, not just your own.

883
01:22:38,527 --> 01:22:41,572
- What are they wagering?
- Oh, the only thing we have.

884
01:22:41,655 --> 01:22:44,033
Years of service.

885
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:50,373
- So any crew member can be challenged?
- Aye. Anyone.

886
01:22:53,251 --> 01:22:56,004
I challenge Davy Jones.

887
01:22:58,089 --> 01:23:00,300
<i>(Heavy footsteps)</i>

888
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:18,611
I accept, mate.

889
01:23:30,165 --> 01:23:35,713
- The stakes?
- My soul. An eternity of servitude.

890
01:23:35,796 --> 01:23:38,007
No!

891
01:23:40,176 --> 01:23:41,719
Against?

892
01:23:43,179 --> 01:23:45,181
I want this.

893
01:23:57,319 --> 01:24:02,241
- How do you know of the key?
- That's not part of the game, is it?

894
01:24:05,411 --> 01:24:08,039
You can still walk away.

895
01:24:32,732 --> 01:24:35,818
- What's this?
- I'm in. Matching his wager.

896
01:24:35,902 --> 01:24:38,821
No! Don't do this.

897
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:43,535
The die is cast.

898
01:24:43,618 --> 01:24:46,705
I bid three twos.

899
01:24:46,788 --> 01:24:48,957
It's your bid, Captain.

900
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:58,259
Four fours.

901
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:10,480
Four fives.

902
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:12,274
Six threes.

903
01:25:21,951 --> 01:25:25,121
Seven fives.

904
01:25:49,021 --> 01:25:51,315
Eight fives.

905
01:25:56,028 --> 01:25:59,532
Welcome to the crew, lad.

906
01:26:01,701 --> 01:26:04,704
Twelve fives.

907
01:26:04,955 --> 01:26:06,623
Twelve fives.

908
01:26:06,706 --> 01:26:09,543
Call me a liar, or up the bid.

909
01:26:10,878 --> 01:26:14,465
And be called a liar myself
for my trouble?

910
01:26:17,927 --> 01:26:22,807
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar
and you will spend an eternity on this ship.

911
01:26:24,726 --> 01:26:28,938
Master Turner,
feel free to go ashore...

912
01:26:30,231 --> 01:26:33,360
the very next time we make port!

913
01:26:40,951 --> 01:26:44,497
Fool. Why did you do that?

914
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:48,251
I couldn't let you lose.

915
01:26:48,334 --> 01:26:51,087
It was never about winning or losing.

916
01:26:53,464 --> 01:26:54,924
The key.

917
01:26:56,593 --> 01:26:59,471
You just wanted to know where it was.

918
01:27:01,056 --> 01:27:03,058
<i>(Snores)</i>

919
01:27:19,075 --> 01:27:21,703
Captain says I'm to relieve you.

920
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:27,793
Captain's orders.

921
01:27:49,733 --> 01:27:51,735
<i>(Snores)</i>

922
01:28:02,413 --> 01:28:04,039
<i>(Grunts)</i>

923
01:28:22,976 --> 01:28:24,186
<i>(Plays note)</i>

924
01:28:28,065 --> 01:28:30,401
<i>(Plays lullaby)</i>

925
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:20,204
Here. Take this, too.

926
01:29:21,163 --> 01:29:24,542
Now, get yourself to land, and stay there.

927
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,254
It was always in my blood to die at sea.

928
01:29:28,337 --> 01:29:31,382
It was not a fate I ever wanted for you.

929
01:29:36,137 --> 01:29:39,849
It's not a fate you had to choose
for yourself, either.

930
01:29:39,933 --> 01:29:46,148
Aye. I could say I did what I had to,
when I left you to go pirating.

931
01:29:47,065 --> 01:29:51,403
But it would taste a lie
to say it wasn't what I wanted.

932
01:29:53,114 --> 01:29:55,783
You owe me nothing, Will.

933
01:29:55,867 --> 01:29:58,077
Now go.

934
01:29:59,203 --> 01:30:01,873
- They'll know you helped me.
- (Laughs)

935
01:30:03,249 --> 01:30:05,251
What more can they do to me?

936
01:30:11,091 --> 01:30:13,343
I take this with a promise.

937
01:30:13,427 --> 01:30:15,846
I'll find a way to sever
Jones's hold on you,

938
01:30:15,929 --> 01:30:19,809
and not rest until this blade
pierces his heart.

939
01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:23,646
I will not abandon you.

940
01:30:26,274 --> 01:30:28,860
I promise.

941
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,127
- (Gibbs) Beckett?
- (Elizabeth) Yes, they're signed.

942
01:30:45,211 --> 01:30:47,755
Lord Cutler Beckett
of the East India Trading Company.

943
01:30:47,838 --> 01:30:49,257
Bleurgh!

944
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:53,094
Will was working for Beckett
and never said a word.

945
01:30:53,469 --> 01:30:57,265
Beckett wants the compass.
Only one reason for that.

946
01:30:57,348 --> 01:30:59,893
Of course.

947
01:30:59,976 --> 01:31:03,730
- He wants the chest.
- Yes, he did say something about a chest.

948
01:31:03,814 --> 01:31:07,443
If the company controls the chest,
they controls the sea.

949
01:31:07,526 --> 01:31:11,280
- A truly discomfiting notion, love.
- And bad.

950
01:31:11,363 --> 01:31:15,034
Bad for every mother's son
what calls himself a pirate.

951
01:31:15,117 --> 01:31:18,371
I think there's a bit more speed
to be coaxed from these sails.

952
01:31:18,454 --> 01:31:20,582
Brace the foreyard!

953
01:31:20,665 --> 01:31:23,877
Might I enquire
as to how you came by these?

954
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:25,879
- Persuasion.
- Friendly?

955
01:31:25,962 --> 01:31:27,589
Decidedly not.

956
01:31:27,672 --> 01:31:33,262
Will strikes a deal, yet you were the one
with the prize - full pardon.

957
01:31:33,345 --> 01:31:35,681
"Commission as a privateer
on behalf of England

958
01:31:35,764 --> 01:31:38,476
and the East India Trading Company."

959
01:31:38,559 --> 01:31:40,853
As if I could be bought
for such a low price.

960
01:31:40,936 --> 01:31:43,439
- Jack, the letters, give them back.
- No.

961
01:31:43,523 --> 01:31:45,858
Persuade me.

962
01:31:45,942 --> 01:31:49,737
You do know Will taught me
how to handle a sword?

963
01:31:52,115 --> 01:31:55,827
As I said, persuade me.

964
01:32:10,092 --> 01:32:12,553
It's a curious thing.

965
01:32:13,638 --> 01:32:19,311
There was a time I would have wanted you
to look like that while thinking about me.

966
01:32:19,394 --> 01:32:21,563
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.

967
01:32:21,646 --> 01:32:24,691
Oh, don't be absurd.
I trust him, that's all.

968
01:32:29,363 --> 01:32:31,657
So you never wondered
how your latest fiancÃ©

969
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:35,786
ended up on the Flying Dutchman
in the first place?

970
01:33:00,271 --> 01:33:03,566
(man) Strange thing to come upon
a longboat so far out in open water.

971
01:33:03,649 --> 01:33:07,070
Just put as many leagues behind us
as you can. As fast as you can.

972
01:33:07,153 --> 01:33:10,281
And what are we running from?

973
01:33:15,078 --> 01:33:17,873
That dress. Where did you get it?

974
01:33:17,956 --> 01:33:19,666
It was found aboard the ship.

975
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:24,255
The crew thought it was a spirit
bringing some omen of ill-fate.

976
01:33:24,338 --> 01:33:27,758
- That's foolish.
- Oh, yes. Exceedingly foolish.

977
01:33:27,842 --> 01:33:33,848
It brought good fortune.
The spirit told us, "Pull in at Tortuga",

978
01:33:33,931 --> 01:33:35,934
and we made a nice bit of profit there.

979
01:33:36,017 --> 01:33:39,145
Off the books, of course.

980
01:33:39,229 --> 01:33:43,024
I imagine some of your crew
may have jumped ship there.

981
01:33:43,108 --> 01:33:45,986
- Why do you ask?
- Captain! A ship's been spotted.

982
01:33:46,069 --> 01:33:48,906
- Colors?
- She isn't flying any.

983
01:33:48,989 --> 01:33:50,991
- Pirates.
- Or worse.

984
01:34:02,462 --> 01:34:06,049
You will watch this.

985
01:34:09,219 --> 01:34:11,013
Aagh!

986
01:34:13,182 --> 01:34:16,185
Let no joyful voice be heard!

987
01:34:18,312 --> 01:34:21,482
Let no man look up at the sky with hope.

988
01:34:21,565 --> 01:34:23,317
Aargh!

989
01:34:23,776 --> 01:34:29,532
And let this day be cursed
by we who ready to wake...

990
01:34:30,992 --> 01:34:33,161
the kraken.

991
01:34:33,578 --> 01:34:35,247
No!

992
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:54,684
I've doomed us all.

993

01:35:05,404 --> 01:35:07,948
Must have hit a reef.

997
01:35:15,581 --> 01:35:18,626
Free the rudder!
Hard to port then hard to starboard.

998
01:35:18,709 --> 01:35:22,213

Aaagh!

The boy's not here.
He must have been claimed by the sea.

1009
01:38:08,056 --> 01:38:10,559
I am the sea.

1010
01:38:14,229 --> 01:38:17,483
You need time alone with your thoughts.

1011
01:38:17,566 --> 01:38:20,110
- Brig!
- What of the survivors?

1012
01:38:25,616 --> 01:38:28,995
There are no survivors.

01:38:57,859 --> 01:39:01,071
Who sent that thieving charlatan

1018
01:39:01,154 --> 01:39:03,115
Who told him of the key?

1019
01:39:06,243 --> 01:39:08,412
Jack Sparrow.

1020
01:39:26,765 --> 01:39:33,564
My intuitive sense of the female creature
informs me that you are troubled.

1021
01:39:33,647 --> 01:39:37,067
I just thought I'd be married by now.

1022
01:39:37,151 --> 01:39:39,486
I'm so ready to be married.

1023
01:39:47,036 --> 01:39:49,080

<i>(Clears throat)</i>

No, thank you.

1030
01:40:15,233 --> 01:40:16,776
Why not?

1031
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:19,904
We are very much alike, you and I.
I and you. Us.

1032
01:40:19,988 --> 01:40:25,077
Oh. Except for a sense of honor
and decency and a moral center.

1033
01:40:25,535 --> 01:40:27,955
And personal hygiene.

1034
01:40:29,415 --> 01:40:31,709
Trifles.

1035
01:40:31,792 --> 01:40:34,336
You will come over to my side. I know it.

1036
01:40:34,420 --> 01:40:39,717
- You seem very certain.
- One word, love. Curiosity.

1037
01:40:39,801 --> 01:40:41,427
You long for freedom.

1038
01:40:41,511 --> 01:40:44,597
You long to do what you want to do
because you want it.

1039
01:40:44,681 --> 01:40:47,767
To act on selfish impulse.

1040
01:40:47,851 --> 01:40:50,604
You want to see what it's like.

1041
01:40:50,687 --> 01:40:55,150
One day, you won't be able to resist.

1042
01:40:55,692 --> 01:40:58,279
Why doesn't your compass work?

1043
01:40:59,905 --> 01:41:02,992
My compass works fine.

1044
01:41:03,409 --> 01:41:05,203
Because you and I are alike,

1045
01:41:05,286 --> 01:41:08,539
and there will come a moment
when you have a chance to show it.

1046
01:41:08,623 --> 01:41:11,918
- To do the right thing.
- I love those moments.

1047
01:41:12,419 --> 01:41:14,713
I like to wave at them as they pass by.

1048
01:41:14,796 --> 01:41:20,385
You'll have the chance to do something...
something courageous.

1049
01:41:20,469 --> 01:41:23,639
And when you do,
you'll discover something.

1050
01:41:23,722 --> 01:41:26,308
That you're a good man.

1051
01:41:26,392 --> 01:41:28,894
All evidence to the contrary.

1052
01:41:28,978 --> 01:41:32,023
Oh, I have faith in you.

1053
01:41:32,106 --> 01:41:35,026
- Want to know why?
- Do tell, dearie.

1054
01:41:36,819 --> 01:41:39,823
Curiosity.

1055
01:41:39,906 --> 01:41:42,868
You're going to want it.

1056
01:41:42,951 --> 01:41:46,830
A chance to be admired
and gain the rewards that follow.

1057
01:41:48,165 --> 01:41:50,334
You won't be able to resist.

1058
01:41:51,710 --> 01:41:56,924
You're going to want to know
what it tastes like.

1059
01:41:59,469 --> 01:42:02,472
I do want to know what it tastes like.

1060
01:42:02,555 --> 01:42:04,349
But... seeing as you're a good man,

1061
01:42:04,432 --> 01:42:08,853
I know that you'd never put me in a position
that would compromise my honor.

1062
01:42:17,154 --> 01:42:19,281
I'm proud of you, Jack.

1063
01:42:19,365 --> 01:42:22,201
(Gibbs) Land, ho!

1064
01:42:27,373 --> 01:42:29,208
I want my jar of dirt.

1065
01:42:30,668 --> 01:42:33,588
- You're pulling too fast.
- You're pulling too slow.

1066
01:42:33,672 --> 01:42:38,802
- We don't want the kraken to catch us.
- I'm saving me strength for when it comes.

1067
01:42:38,885 --> 01:42:43,307
And I don't think it's "Kracken" anyways.
I always heard it said "Krayken".

1068
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:45,017
- With a long "a"?
- Uh-huh.

1069
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:48,979
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. "Krocken"
is how it's pronounced in Scandinavian,

1070
01:42:49,063 --> 01:42:50,815
and "Kracken" is closer to that.

1071
01:42:50,898 --> 01:42:54,360
We ain't Scandinavians, are we?
"Krayken."

1072
01:42:54,444 --> 01:42:57,155
It's a mythological creature.
I can calls it what I wants.

1073
01:43:01,034 --> 01:43:03,286
Guard the boat. Mind the tide.

1074
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:05,706
Don't touch my dirt.

1075
01:43:41,577 --> 01:43:46,791
This doesn't work. And it certainly
doesn't show you what you want most.

1076
01:43:50,962 --> 01:43:54,299
(Jack) Yes, it does.
You're sitting on it.

1077
01:43:55,175 --> 01:43:56,885
- Beg pardon?
- Move.

1078
01:44:04,601 --> 01:44:07,396
- "Guard the boat!" "Mind the tide!"
- I could join the circus.

1079
01:44:07,479 --> 01:44:09,106
Mind if I shine your shoes, sir?

1080
01:44:13,528 --> 01:44:18,241
They're here. And I cannot step foot
on land again for near of a decade.

1081

You'll trust us to act in your stead?

1082
01:44:20,410 --> 01:44:23,788
I'll trust you to know
what awaits you should you fail!

1083
01:44:25,373 --> 01:44:28,377

You actually were telling the truth.

1088

I do that quite a lot,

You're all right! Thank God!
I came to find you!

(Jack) How did you get here?

1093
01:46:04,479 --> 01:46:08,441
Sea turtles, mate.
A pair of them, strapped to my feet.

1094
01:46:08,525 --> 01:46:10,402
Not so easy, is it?

1095
01:46:10,485 --> 01:46:13,113
- But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
- You do?

1096
01:46:13,196 --> 01:46:17,367
After you tricked me onto that ship
to square your debt with Jones...

1097
01:46:17,451 --> 01:46:19,495
- What?
- (imitates Elizabeth) What?

1098
01:46:20,079 --> 01:46:22,748
...I was reunited with my father.

1099
01:46:22,832 --> 01:46:25,543
Oh, well... you're welcome, then.

1100
01:46:26,043 --> 01:46:29,881
Everything you said to me,
every word was a lie!

1101
01:46:29,964 --> 01:46:31,466
Pretty much.

1102

Oi! What are you doing?

1104
01:46:37,347 --> 01:46:39,725
I'm going to kill Jones.

1105
01:46:40,726 --> 01:46:43,020
Can't let you do that, William.

1106
01:46:43,103 --> 01:46:49,151
Cos if Jones is dead, who's to call
his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh?

1107
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:58,536
Now, if you please.

1108
01:46:59,204 --> 01:47:01,748
The key.

1109
01:47:03,917 --> 01:47:06,628
I keep the promises I make, Jack.

1110
01:47:06,712 --> 01:47:10,048
I intend to free my father.
I hope you're here to see it.

1111
01:47:10,132 --> 01:47:13,761
I can't let you do that either.
So sorry.

1112
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:17,473
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.

1113
01:47:18,307 --> 01:47:22,270
Lord Beckett desires
the content of that chest.

I deliver it, I get my life back.

1115

Ah. The dark side of ambition.

1116
01:47:29,027 --> 01:47:32,447
Oh, I prefer to see it
as the promise of redemption.

This is no way for grown men to...

1123

Oh, fine! Let's just haul out our swords
and start banging away at each other.

1124

That will solve everything! I've had it!

1125
01:48:04,022 --> 01:48:08,986
I've had it with wobbly-legged,
rum-soaked pirates!

1126
01:48:11,614 --> 01:48:16,786
- How'd this go all screwy?
- Well, each wants the chest for hisself.

1127
01:48:16,869 --> 01:48:20,039
Mr. Norrington, I think,
is trying to regain a bit of honor,

1128
01:48:20,123 --> 01:48:22,626
old Jack's looking to trade it,
save his own skin,

1129
01:48:22,709 --> 01:48:26,880
then Turner, there, I think he's trying
to settle some unresolved business

1130
01:48:26,963 --> 01:48:30,592
'twixt him and his
twice-cursed pirate father. (belches)

1131
01:48:30,676 --> 01:48:32,636
- Sad.
- (Elizabeth) This is madness!

1132
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:36,515
That chest must be worth
more than a shiny penny.

1133
01:48:36,599 --> 01:48:38,517
Terrible temptation.

1134
01:48:38,601 --> 01:48:44,607
If we was any kind of decent,
we'd remove temptation from their path.

1146

Who was it, that at the very moment you
had a notorious pirate safely behind bars,

1147
01:51:32,035 --> 01:51:38,333
saw fit to free said pirate and
take your dearly beloved all to hisself?

Eh?

1149
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:42,546

1150
01:51:42,630 --> 01:51:47,009
that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand
what takes orders from pirates?

02:01:37,553 --> 02:01:41,641
- Let them taste the triple guns.
- Aye, Captain.

1213
02:01:53,362 --> 02:01:55,406
Aaargh!

1214
02:02:07,502 --> 02:02:09,045
Make fast!

1215
02:02:10,296 --> 02:02:12,841
Go on, me darling!
Show us what you've got!

1216
02:02:12,924 --> 02:02:15,677
Come on, girl!

1217
02:02:21,725 --> 02:02:24,144
- She's falling behind!
- Aye. We've got her!

1218
02:02:24,228 --> 02:02:27,940
- We're the faster?
- Against the wind, the Dutchman beats us.

1219
02:02:28,024 --> 02:02:30,485
- But with the wind...
- We rob her advantage.

1220
02:02:30,568 --> 02:02:32,403
Aye.

1221
02:02:34,447 --> 02:02:35,990
We're out of range!

1222
02:02:36,074 --> 02:02:40,704
Break off pursuit,
run her light and douse canvas!

1223
02:02:40,787 --> 02:02:43,165
We're giving up, sir?

1224
02:02:47,544 --> 02:02:49,546
Agh!

My father is on that ship.

1228
02:03:03,853 --> 02:03:06,356
We can take her.
We should turn and fight.

1229
02:03:06,439 --> 02:03:13,405
Why fight when you can negotiate?
All one needs is the proper leverage.

02:03:27,670 --> 02:03:30,632
We must have hit a reef!

1234
02:03:32,717 --> 02:03:36,763
No. It's not a reef!
Get away from the rail!

1235
02:03:36,847 --> 02:03:39,892
- What is it?
- The kraken.

- To arms!
- Load guns! Defend the mast!

1237
02:03:42,603 --> 02:03:47,066
It'll attack the starboard. Run out
the cannons and hold for my signal!

1238

Easy, boys!

1239

- Fire!

Pull the grates. Get all the gunpowder
onto the net in the cargo hold!

1248

- Whatever you do, don't miss.
- As soon as you're clear.

1249

We are short-stocked on gunpowder!
Six barrels!

Aye, the rum too!

Did we kill it?

No. We just made it angry.

We're not out of this yet.
Captain, orders!

Jack. The Pearl.

1276

She's only a ship, mate.

1277
02:10:40,588 --> 02:10:43,133
He's right.
We have to head for land.

1278
02:10:43,216 --> 02:10:46,303
- It's a lot of open water.
- It's a lot of water.

We have to try. We can get away
as it takes down the Pearl.

1280
02:10:52,935 --> 02:10:54,770
Abandon ship.

1281
02:10:54,854 --> 02:10:57,273
Abandon ship or abandon hope.

1282
02:11:13,999 --> 02:11:16,168
Thank you, Jack.

Where's Jack?

The captain goes down with his ship.

1306
02:15:41,950 --> 02:15:45,955
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow
can best the devil.

02:15:51,252 --> 02:15:53,838
Open the chest.

1308
02:15:54,964 --> 02:15:57,508
Open the chest. I need to see it!

02:16:27,749 --> 02:16:30,168
Is there any news on the chest?

1312
02:16:30,252 --> 02:16:35,883
None. But one of the ships
did pick up a man adrift at sea.

1313
02:16:35,966 --> 02:16:38,135
He had these.

1314
02:16:45,101 --> 02:16:48,271
I took the liberty of filling in my name.

02:16:55,820 --> 02:16:59,908
If you intend to claim these,
then you must have something to trade.

Do you have the compass?

1317
02:17:02,703 --> 02:17:04,538

02:18:24,832 --> 02:18:27,418
It's a shame.

1323
02:18:27,501 --> 02:18:29,962
I know you're thinking that with the Pearl

1324
02:18:30,045 --> 02:18:35,426
you could have captured the devil
and set free your father's soul.

1325
02:18:35,510 --> 02:18:38,263
Doesn't matter now.

1326
02:18:38,346 --> 02:18:40,932
The Pearl is gone,

02:18:45,353 --> 02:18:49,274
And already the world
seems a bit less bright.

He fooled us all right till the end,

1331
02:18:52,569 --> 02:18:56,323
but I guess that honest streak
finally won out.

02:19:01,037 --> 02:19:06,042

- He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.

1334
02:19:06,626 --> 02:19:08,712
He was a good man.

1335
02:19:29,400 --> 02:19:33,488
If there was anything could be done
to bring him back...

1336
02:19:34,864 --> 02:19:37,200
- Elizabeth.
- Would you do it?

1337
02:19:37,284 --> 02:19:38,577
Hm?

02:19:42,205 --> 02:19:43,874
Hm?

1340
02:19:45,626 --> 02:19:49,547
What would any of you
be willing to do, hm?

1341
02:19:50,715 --> 02:19:54,635
Would you sail to the ends of the Earth
and beyond

02:19:54,719 --> 02:19:59,808
to fetch back witty Jack
and him precious Pearl?

1343

1351
02:20:33,677 --> 02:20:39,975
then you will need a captain
who knows those waters.

02:20:54,866 --> 02:20:59,037
So tell me,
what's become of my ship?
