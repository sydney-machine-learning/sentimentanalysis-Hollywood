1
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,023
Mozart!

2
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:40,493
Mozart!

3
00:00:40,702 --> 00:00:43,288
Forgive your assassin!

4
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,459
I confess, I killed you!

5
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:50,712
<i>Sì, I killed you, Mozart.</i>

6
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:58,262
<i>Mozart, pietà!
Forgive your assassin!</i>

7
00:00:59,138 --> 00:01:01,849
Forgive me, Mozart!

8
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:07,772
<i>Signore Salieri,
open the door, be good now!</i>

9
00:01:08,397 --> 00:01:11,359
<i>Signore, we have
something special for you.</i>

10
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:14,654
Something you're going to love.

11
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:20,744
Is that good!

12
00:01:23,246 --> 00:01:25,749
<i>Signore, believe me...</i>

13
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:30,337
...this is the most delicious thing
I ever ate in my life!

14
00:01:31,213 --> 00:01:34,424
Really, you don't know
what you're miss...

15
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,433
All right, that's enough!
Open the door.

16
00:01:46,812 --> 00:01:50,149
<i>Signore, if you don't
open this door...</i>

17
00:01:50,358 --> 00:01:53,236
...we're gonna leave nothing
for you.

18
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:56,656
And I'm never gonna come
see you again!

19
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:57,925
Good morning, Father.

20
00:05:27,623 --> 00:05:29,374
<i>Herr Salieri?</i>

21
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,787
Leave me alone.

22
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:14,963
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.

23
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:18,258
Do you know who I am?

24
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:22,638
That makes no difference.

25
00:06:23,097 --> 00:06:26,058
All men are equal in God's eyes.

26
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:32,648
Are they?

27
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:36,152
Offer me your confession.

28
00:06:39,238 --> 00:06:42,324
I can offer you God's forgiveness.

29
00:06:46,662 --> 00:06:49,582
How well are you trained in music?

30
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:56,005
I know a little.
I studied it in my youth.

31
00:06:56,923 --> 00:06:59,509
- Where?
- Here in Vienna.

32
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:03,764
Then you must know this.

33
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:14,776
I can't say that I do.

34
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:17,236
What is it?

35
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:21,574
It was a very popular tune in its day.

36
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:23,034
I wrote it.

37
00:07:25,203 --> 00:07:27,455
Here, how about this?

38
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:34,212
This one brought down the house
when we played it.

39
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:21,176
Well?

40
00:08:23,805 --> 00:08:27,517
I regret it is not too familiar.

41
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:29,978
Can you recall no melody of mine?

42
00:08:31,062 --> 00:08:34,274
I was the most famous composer
in Europe.

43
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:37,068
I wrote 40 operas alone.

44
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:40,488
Here!

45
00:08:40,697 --> 00:08:43,074
What about this one?

46
00:08:58,798 --> 00:09:00,551
Yes, I know that!

47
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,304
That's charming!

48
00:09:03,512 --> 00:09:06,515
I'm sorry, I didn't know
you wrote that.

49
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:09,268
I didn't.

50
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:18,694
That was Mozart.

51
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:22,656
Wolfgang...

52
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:26,660
...Amadeus Mozart.

53
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:31,499
The man you accuse yourself
of killing.

54
00:09:35,002 --> 00:09:37,129
You've heard that?

55
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,340
Is it true?

56
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:51,061
For God's sake, my son...

57
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:57,985
...if you have something to confess,
do it now.

58
00:09:58,402 --> 00:10:01,072
Give yourself some peace.

59
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:06,786
He...

60
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:10,039
...was my idol.

61
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:15,336
<i>Mozart.</i>

62
00:10:16,337 --> 00:10:20,133
<i>I can 't think of a time
when I didn 't know his name.</i>

63
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:22,135
<i>I was playing games...</i>

64
00:10:22,343 --> 00:10:26,639
<i>... when he was playing music
for kings and emperors.</i>

65
00:10:26,848 --> 00:10:29,517
<i>Even the pope in Rome.</i>

66
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:35,731
<i>I admit, I was jealous...</i>

67
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:39,277
<i>... when I heard the tales
they told about him.</i>

68
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:41,863
<i>Not of the brilliant little prodigy...</i>

69
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:46,951
<i>... but of his father,
who had taught him everything.</i>

70
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,539
<i>My father, he did not care for music.</i>

71
00:10:51,206 --> 00:10:52,624
When I told him...

72
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:56,378
...how I wished I could be
like Mozart...

73
00:10:56,587 --> 00:11:01,008
<i>... he would say, "Why? Do you want
to be a trained monkey?</i>

74
00:11:01,216 --> 00:11:06,180
<i>You'd like me to drag you around,
doing tricks like a circus freak?"</i>

75
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:12,227
How could I tell him...

76
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:16,191
...what music meant to me?

77
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:33,500
<i>While my father
prayed earnestly to God...</i>

78
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,377
<i>... to protect commerce...</i>

79
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:38,755
<i>... I would offer up...</i>

80
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:41,132
<i>... secretly...</i>

81
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:44,887
<i>... the proudest prayer
a boy could think of.</i>

82
00:11:45,096 --> 00:11:49,391
<i>"Lord, make me a great composer.</i>

83
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:53,604
<i>Let me celebrate your glory
through music...</i>

84
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,607
<i>... and be celebrated myself.</i>

85
00:11:58,025 --> 00:12:00,694
<i>Make me famous through the world.</i>

86
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:03,614
<i>Make me immortal.</i>

87
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:06,367
<i>After I die...</i>

88
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:11,413
...let people speak my name
with love for what I wrote.

89
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:14,792
In return...

90
00:12:15,543 --> 00:12:18,921
...I will give you my chastity...

91
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,507
...my industry...

92
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:26,887
...my deepest humility,
every hour of my life.

93
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:31,016
<i>Amen. "</i>

94
00:12:32,143 --> 00:12:34,687
<i>And do you know what happened?</i>

95
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:37,023
<i>A miracle!</i>

96
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:57,545
My life changed forever.

97
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:02,049
I knew God had arranged it all.
That was obvious.

98
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:05,470
One minute I was a frustrated boy...

99
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:09,557
...in an obscure little town.
The next I was here...

100
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:12,894
...in Vienna, city of musicians...

101
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,774
<i>... and Emperor Joseph,
the musical king.</i>

102
00:13:17,982 --> 00:13:22,945
<i>In a few years, I was his court
composer. Isn 't that incredible?</i>

103
00:13:23,154 --> 00:13:26,407
<i>Every night I sat with
the emperor of Austria...</i>

104
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:28,451
<i>... playing duets with him...</i>

105
00:13:28,659 --> 00:13:31,288
<i>... correcting the royal sight-reading.</i>

106
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:38,170
Actually, the man had no ear at all.

107
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,548
But what did it matter?

108
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,135
He adored my music.

109
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:47,805
Tell me...

110
00:13:48,055 --> 00:13:50,432
If you had been me...

111
00:13:51,058 --> 00:13:55,562
...wouldn't you have thought
God had accepted your vow?

112
00:13:57,356 --> 00:13:59,733
And believe me, I honored it.

113
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,611
I was a model of virtue.

114
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:05,155
I kept my hands off women.

115
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:09,828
I worked hours every day
teaching students, many for free!

116
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:15,250
Sitting on endless committees
to help poor musicians.

117
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:18,086
Work, that was all my life.

118
00:14:18,294 --> 00:14:20,421
And it was wonderful.

119
00:14:20,672 --> 00:14:23,133
Everybody liked me.

120
00:14:25,177 --> 00:14:27,346
I liked myself.

121
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:32,935
Until he came.

122
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:39,275
He came to Vienna to play
some of his music...

123
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:45,990
...at the residence
of the Prince Archbishop of Salzburg.

124
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:50,661
<i>Eagerly, I went there to seek him out.</i>

125
00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:55,875
<i>That night...</i>

126
00:14:57,626 --> 00:14:59,920
<i>... changed my life.</i>

127
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:06,802
<i>As I wandered through the salon...</i>

128
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:09,722
<i>... I played a little game with myself.</i>

129
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,351
<i>This man had written
his first concerto at the age of 4...</i>

130
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,524
<i>... his first symphony at 7,
a full-scale opera at 12!</i>

131
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:22,194
<i>Did it show?</i>

132
00:15:23,904 --> 00:15:26,573
<i>Is talent like that...</i>

133
00:15:26,782 --> 00:15:29,576
<i>... written on the face?</i>

134
00:15:30,952 --> 00:15:33,497
<i>Which one of them...</i>

135
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:37,460
<i>... could he be?</i>

136
00:17:40,044 --> 00:17:42,546
Mozart is not here.

137
00:17:47,802 --> 00:17:49,053
- Stop it!
- I am.

138
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:51,639
- Stop it!
- I am stopping it.

139
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:55,935
I am! I'm stopping it. Slowly.

140
00:17:56,143 --> 00:18:00,607
There. You see? I've stopped.

141
00:18:00,816 --> 00:18:02,818
- Now we're going back.
- No!

142
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:05,695
Yes! You don't know where you are.

143
00:18:05,904 --> 00:18:08,448
Here, everything goes backwards.

144
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:13,787
People walk and dance and sing
and even talk backwards.

145
00:18:14,412 --> 00:18:18,834
- That's stupid.
- Why? People fart backwards.

146
00:18:20,836 --> 00:18:22,712
Ssa-ym-ssik!

147
00:18:23,171 --> 00:18:24,798
Ssa-ym-ssik!

148
00:18:25,006 --> 00:18:27,385
Yes, you are. You are very sick.

149
00:18:27,593 --> 00:18:31,013
No! Say it backwards, shitwit!

150
00:18:31,597 --> 00:18:33,516
Ssa-ym-ssik.

151
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,060
Ssik, kiss.

152
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:38,771
Ym, my. Ssa.

153
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:42,567
Kiss my ass.

154
00:18:43,484 --> 00:18:44,819
Em-yrram!

155
00:18:45,027 --> 00:18:47,738
- I'm not playing!
- Say it, it's serious.

156
00:18:47,947 --> 00:18:49,323
It's very serious.

157
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:54,037
Yrram.

158
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:57,583
Marry me.

159
00:18:58,292 --> 00:19:01,420
I'm not gonna marry you.
You're a fiend.

160
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:03,005
Uoy-evol-l-tub.

161
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:07,509
Tub.

162
00:19:07,718 --> 00:19:09,553
But I...

163
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:13,307
...love...

164
00:19:13,515 --> 00:19:15,976
But I love you?

165
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:26,111
- Tihs-ym-tae.
- What?

166
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:33,494
- Eat.
- Eat.

167
00:19:33,702 --> 00:19:36,705
- Ym, my.
- My.

168
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:38,707
Tihs. Eat my shit.

169
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,460
You filthy fiend!

170
00:19:41,668 --> 00:19:44,588
You filthy...!

171
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,179
My music.

172
00:19:52,388 --> 00:19:54,850
They've started without me.

173
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:11,511
That was Mozart!

174
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:17,934
That giggling, dirty creature
I'd just seen crawling on the floor.

175
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:22,440
- I think that went well, don't you?
- Indeed.

176
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:26,152
The Viennese know good music,
don't you think?

177
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,403
Certainly.

178
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:32,158
Your Grace.

179
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:36,580
Ah, Mozart.

180
00:21:37,915 --> 00:21:40,709
- Why?
- Why what, sir?

181
00:21:40,918 --> 00:21:44,838
Why do I have to be humiliated
in front of my guests...

182
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:47,382
...by one of my own servants?

183
00:21:47,591 --> 00:21:51,136
The more license I allow you,
the more you take.

184
00:21:51,345 --> 00:21:55,265
If His Grace is not satisfied,
he can dismiss me.

185
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:59,520
I wish you to return immediately
to Salzburg.

186
00:21:59,728 --> 00:22:03,649
- Your father is waiting for you there.
- No, Your Grace!

187
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:09,196
I would prefer you dismissed me.
It's obvious I don't satisfy.

188
00:22:09,404 --> 00:22:14,785
I have no intention of dismissing you.
You will remain in my service...

189
00:22:14,993 --> 00:22:17,663
...and learn your place.

190
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,953
<i>On the page it looked...</i>

191
00:22:56,162 --> 00:22:57,955
<i>Nothing!</i>

192
00:22:58,164 --> 00:23:02,209
The beginning simple, almost comic.

193
00:23:03,461 --> 00:23:05,004
Just a pulse.

194
00:23:05,254 --> 00:23:08,883
Bassoons, basset horns...

195
00:23:09,091 --> 00:23:12,094
...like a rusty squeezebox.

196
00:23:15,014 --> 00:23:17,600
And then, suddenly...

197
00:23:17,808 --> 00:23:20,019
...high above it...

198
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:24,024
...an oboe.

199
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:29,488
A single note, hanging there,
unwavering.

200
00:23:31,865 --> 00:23:33,533
Until...

201
00:23:33,742 --> 00:23:36,661
...a clarinet took it over...

202
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:43,502
...sweetened it into a phrase
of such delight.

203
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:51,760
This was no composition
by a performing monkey.

204
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:57,933
This was a music I had never heard.

205
00:24:00,685 --> 00:24:04,689
Filled with such longing,
such unfulfillable longing.

206
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:10,112
<i>It seemed to me I was hearing
the voice of God.</i>

207
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,571
Excuse me.

208
00:24:13,074 --> 00:24:14,826
<i>But why?</i>

209
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:20,624
<i>Why would God choose an obscene child
to be his instrument?</i>

210
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,335
It was not to be believed.

211
00:24:23,544 --> 00:24:28,173
This piece had to be an accident.
It had to be.

212
00:24:32,344 --> 00:24:33,971
It better be.

213
00:24:35,055 --> 00:24:37,432
How good is he, this Mozart?

214
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:43,230
He's remarkable, Majesty. I heard an
extraordinary opera of his last month.

215
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,859
<i>- Idomeneo, King of Crete.
- That?</i>

216
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:50,195
A tiresome piece. I heard it too.

217
00:24:50,863 --> 00:24:52,114
Tiresome?

218
00:24:53,073 --> 00:24:57,327
A young man trying to impress
beyond his abilities.

219
00:24:57,536 --> 00:24:59,913
Too much spice.

220
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:02,249
Too many notes.

221
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,126
Majesty...

222
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:07,880
...it was the most promising work
I've heard in years.

223
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:11,717
Then, we should make
some effort to acquire him.

224
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:16,264
We could use a good German composer
in Vienna, surely?

225
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:21,144
I'm sure he could be tempted
with the right offer. Say...

226
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:25,398
...an opera in German
for our National Theater.

227
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,816
Excellent, sire!

228
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:30,820
But not German. I beg, Your Majesty.

229
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:35,408
Italian is the proper language
for opera.

230
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,328
All educated people agree on that.

231
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,877
What do you think, chamberlain?

232
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,757
In my opinion, it's time
we had a piece in our own language.

233
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:54,428
Plain German for plain people.

234
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,975
Kapellmeister?

235
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,769
Majesty...

236
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,231
<i>...I must agree with Herr Direttore.</i>

237
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:08,944
German is...

238
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:15,867
...too brute for singing.

239
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:20,789
Court composer...

240
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,668
...what do you think?

241
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:29,756
I think it's an interesting notion
to keep Mozart in Vienna.

242
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:32,717
It should infuriate the archbishop...

243
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,971
...if that is Your Majesty's
intention.

244
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,683
<i>You are cattivo, court composer.</i>

245
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:46,898
I want to meet this young man.
Arrange a pleasant welcome for him.

246
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:50,152
Well, there it is!

247
00:27:23,228 --> 00:27:26,023
This is a beautiful wig for you.

248
00:27:26,231 --> 00:27:30,194
It looks so marvelous and I love it.

249
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:31,653
The other one.

250
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:37,159
Here is the other one.
I think you will love it.

251
00:27:40,412 --> 00:27:44,166
Here's the third one. So? Here we go.

252
00:27:44,374 --> 00:27:48,045
- How do you like it?
- They're all so beautiful!

253
00:27:48,253 --> 00:27:51,006
Why don't I have three heads?

254
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:54,427
This is funny!

255
00:27:54,677 --> 00:27:55,929
Three heads!

256
00:27:57,222 --> 00:27:58,473
Gentlemen.

257
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:01,643
- Good morning.
- Morning, Your Majesty.

258
00:28:04,729 --> 00:28:07,190
What do you have for me today?

259
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:11,528
<i>- Your Majesty, Herr Mozart.
- Yes, what about him?</i>

260
00:28:11,778 --> 00:28:13,696
He's here.

261
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:17,909
Well, there it is. Good!

262
00:28:18,118 --> 00:28:23,623
I hope you won't find it improper,
but I've written a march in his honor.

263
00:28:23,832 --> 00:28:27,877
What a charming idea, court composer.
May I see?

264
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:29,462
Just a...

265
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:32,341
Just a trifle, of course.

266
00:28:34,677 --> 00:28:35,928
May I try it?

267
00:28:40,141 --> 00:28:42,476
Let's have some fun.

268
00:28:56,992 --> 00:29:00,120
Delightful, court composer!

269
00:29:01,455 --> 00:29:04,082
May I play it when he comes in?

270
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:08,795
<i>- You do me too much honor.
- Bring in Herr Mozart.</i>

271
00:29:09,004 --> 00:29:10,672
But slowly.

272
00:29:10,881 --> 00:29:13,508
I need a minute to practice.

273
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,325
Good, continue.

274
00:29:40,911 --> 00:29:43,039
G, Majesty.

275
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,085
Excellent!

276
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:51,964
Good, Majesty.

277
00:29:52,215 --> 00:29:55,635
Continue. Very good.

278
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,515
Very good, Majesty.

279
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:04,269
Tempo! Up.

280
00:30:04,478 --> 00:30:08,190
Lightly, then strongly!
It's a march, Majesty.

281
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:10,025
Again.

282
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:51,067
Bravo, Majesty!

283
00:30:51,776 --> 00:30:56,990
Gentlemen, please.
A little less enthusiasm, I beg you.

284
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:05,707
No, please. It's not a holy relic.

285
00:31:08,585 --> 00:31:12,422
You know, we have met before.
In this very room.

286
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:17,552
You don't recall. You were only 6.
He was giving a delightful concert!

287
00:31:18,219 --> 00:31:20,847
As he got off the stool, he fell.

288
00:31:21,055 --> 00:31:24,935
My sister Antoinette helped him up.
Know what he did?

289
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:30,066
He jumped into her arms and said,
"Will you marry me? Yes or no?"

290
00:31:33,987 --> 00:31:37,782
You know all these gentlemen.
The Baron Van Swieten.

291
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:41,745
- I'm a great admirer of yours.
- Thank you.

292
00:31:41,953 --> 00:31:43,622
Kapellmeister Bonno.

293
00:31:45,624 --> 00:31:46,875
My pleasure.

294
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:50,712
The Director of Opera,
Count Orsini-Rosenberg.

295
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:54,132
Sir, yes. The honor is mine,
absolutely!

296
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:59,596
Here is our
illustrious court composer...

297
00:31:59,805 --> 00:32:01,723
...Maestro Salieri.

298
00:32:03,225 --> 00:32:06,561
At last, such immense joy!

299
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:10,357
I know your work well.

300
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:15,153
You know, I composed some variations
on a melody of yours.

301
00:32:15,362 --> 00:32:18,323
<i>- Really? Which one?
- "Mio Caro Adone."</i>

302
00:32:18,532 --> 00:32:19,908
I'm flattered.

303
00:32:20,116 --> 00:32:23,245
A funny tune,
but it yielded good things.

304
00:32:23,453 --> 00:32:26,332
And now he has returned
the compliment.

305
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:30,128
<i>Herr Salieri composed
this little march for you.</i>

306
00:32:30,336 --> 00:32:32,004
Really?

307
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,842
Well, there it is.

308
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:41,389
Down to business. We're going
to commission an opera from you.

309
00:32:41,597 --> 00:32:43,474
What do you say?

310
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:48,187
Did we vote in the end
for German or Italian?

311
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:54,111
Sire, if you remember,
we did finally incline to Italian.

312
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:56,363
Did we?

313
00:32:57,489 --> 00:33:01,410
I don't think it was really decided,
Your Majesty.

314
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,957
- German. Please let it be German.
- Why so?

315
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:11,211
Because I've already found
the most wonderful libretto.

316
00:33:11,628 --> 00:33:13,672
Have I seen it?

317
00:33:14,381 --> 00:33:18,428
<i>I don't think you have, Herr Direktor.
It's quite new.</i>

318
00:33:18,636 --> 00:33:23,016
- I'll show it to you immediately.
- I think you'd better.

319
00:33:23,224 --> 00:33:24,601
Well...

320
00:33:25,143 --> 00:33:29,147
...tell us about it.
Tell us the story.

321
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:35,361
Well, it's quite amusing, Majesty.

322
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,283
It's set...
The whole thing is set in a...

323
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:48,416
Yes? Where?

324
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:52,629
In a harem, Majesty. In a seraglio.

325
00:33:52,837 --> 00:33:56,216
- You mean in Turkey?
- Yes, exactly.

326
00:33:57,342 --> 00:34:01,721
Then why especially
does it have to be in German?

327
00:34:02,472 --> 00:34:07,519
It doesn't, especially. It could be
in Turkish if you really want.

328
00:34:08,102 --> 00:34:12,733
No, my dear fellow, the language
is not finally the point.

329
00:34:12,942 --> 00:34:18,532
Do you really think that subject
is appropriate for a national theater?

330
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,660
Why not? It's charming.

331
00:34:22,118 --> 00:34:28,166
I mean, I won't actually show
concubines exposing their...

332
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:32,295
It's not indecent.
It's highly moral, Majesty.

333
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:35,298
It's full of proper German virtues.

334
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:39,845
Excuse me, Majesty, but what
do you think these could be?

335
00:34:40,053 --> 00:34:42,973
Being a foreigner, I'd love to learn.

336
00:34:43,473 --> 00:34:46,768
Well, tell him, Mozart.

337
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,521
Name us a German virtue.

338
00:34:49,729 --> 00:34:52,691
- Love, sire.
- Oh, love!

339
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:56,444
Of course, in Italy
we know nothing about love.

340
00:35:00,282 --> 00:35:02,409
No, I don't think you do.

341
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:07,206
Watching Italian opera,
all those male sopranos screeching...

342
00:35:07,415 --> 00:35:13,421
...stupid, fat couples rolling their eyes
about. That's not love. It's rubbish!

343
00:35:14,672 --> 00:35:18,176
Majesty, you choose the language.

344
00:35:18,384 --> 00:35:22,930
I'll set it to the finest music
ever offered a monarch.

345
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:26,767
Well, there it is.
Let it be German.

346
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,313
This is yours.

347
00:35:30,521 --> 00:35:33,232
Keep it.
It's already here in my head.

348
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:36,652
What? On one hearing only?

349
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:40,114
I think so, sire. Yes.

350
00:35:43,494 --> 00:35:45,287
Show us.

351
00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:17,946
The rest is just the same, isn't it?

352
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:24,619
That doesn't really work, does it?

353
00:36:26,871 --> 00:36:28,122
Did you try...?

354
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:32,961
Shouldn't it be a bit more...?

355
00:36:33,336 --> 00:36:35,046
Or this?

356
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:37,257
This. Yes.

357
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:44,430
Better? What do you think?

358
00:37:31,021 --> 00:37:33,732
<i>Grazie, Signore.</i>

359
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:40,113
<i>All I ever wanted
was to sing to God.</i>

360
00:37:40,405 --> 00:37:43,658
He gave me that longing...

361
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:47,413
...and then made me mute. Why?

362
00:37:48,789 --> 00:37:50,750
Tell me that.

363
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:55,630
If he didn't want me
to praise him with music...

364
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:58,633
...why implant the desire...

365
00:37:58,966 --> 00:38:01,886
...like a lust in my body?

366
00:38:02,386 --> 00:38:04,806
And then deny me the talent?

367
00:38:08,643 --> 00:38:11,771
Madame Cavalieri is here
for her lesson, sir.

368
00:38:11,979 --> 00:38:13,648
Maestro.

369
00:38:16,108 --> 00:38:17,360
Well...?

370
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,781
How do you like it?

371
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,617
It's Turkish.

372
00:38:24,826 --> 00:38:29,372
My hairdresser said everything
this year's going to be Turkish.

373
00:38:29,622 --> 00:38:31,415
Does he?

374
00:38:34,544 --> 00:38:37,714
What else did he tell you today?

375
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:43,513
Come, come! Give me some gossip.

376
00:38:45,306 --> 00:38:48,935
<i>Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.</i>

377
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:54,607
News travels fast in Vienna.

378
00:38:54,983 --> 00:38:59,445
And he's been commissioned
to write an opera. Is it true?

379
00:39:00,196 --> 00:39:03,408
- Yes.
- Is there a part in it for me?

380
00:39:03,616 --> 00:39:06,327
- No.
- How do you know?

381
00:39:06,536 --> 00:39:10,206
- Do you know where it's set, my dear?
- Where?

382
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:12,250
In a harem.

383
00:39:13,168 --> 00:39:16,546
- What's that?
- A brothel.

384
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:22,093
Come.

385
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,971
Let's begin.

386
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:28,975
- What does he look like?
- Mozart?

387
00:39:29,184 --> 00:39:31,853
- You might be disappointed.
- Why?

388
00:39:32,729 --> 00:39:37,067
Looks and talent don't always
go together, Katerina.

389
00:39:37,276 --> 00:39:40,070
Looks don't concern me, maestro.

390
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:44,533
Only talent interests
a woman of taste.

391
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,286
Shall we continue?

392
00:40:25,075 --> 00:40:26,993
There she was.

393
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:33,209
<i>I don 't know where they met or how.
There she stood!</i>

394
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:35,795
<i>On stage, for all to see.</i>

395
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:40,049
<i>Showing off like
the greedy songbird she was.</i>

396
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:18,504
Ten minutes of ghastly scales.
Arpeggios!

397
00:41:18,713 --> 00:41:22,800
<i>Whizzing up and down
like fireworks at a fairground.</i>

398
00:41:33,313 --> 00:41:37,025
Understand, I was
in love with the girl.

399
00:41:37,942 --> 00:41:40,028
Or at least in lust.

400
00:41:41,154 --> 00:41:45,492
And I swear to you,
I never laid a finger on her.

401
00:41:49,787 --> 00:41:55,168
All the same, I couldn't bear
to think of anyone else touching her.

402
00:41:55,376 --> 00:41:58,296
Least of all, "the creature."

403
00:43:41,903 --> 00:43:46,616
Brava, madame!
You are an ornament to our stage.

404
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:49,118
Your Majesty.

405
00:43:52,622 --> 00:43:55,750
<i>Well, Herr Mozart. A good effort.</i>

406
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,668
Well, decidedly that.

407
00:43:57,877 --> 00:44:01,589
An excellent effort!
You have shown us something...

408
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:06,512
...quite new tonight.
- It is new.

409
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,306
- It is, isn't it, sire?
- Yes, indeed.

410
00:44:09,515 --> 00:44:13,894
So then, you liked it?
You really liked it, sire?

411
00:44:14,102 --> 00:44:17,105
Well, of course I did! It's very good!

412
00:44:17,314 --> 00:44:21,360
Of course, now and then,
just now and then...

413
00:44:21,569 --> 00:44:24,155
...it seemed a touch...

414
00:44:25,573 --> 00:44:27,450
What do you mean, sire?

415
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:31,913
Well, I mean, occasionally,
it seems to have...

416
00:44:32,664 --> 00:44:35,083
How shall one say...?

417
00:44:37,794 --> 00:44:40,213
<i>How shall one say, direktor?</i>

418
00:44:40,421 --> 00:44:43,967
- Too many notes, Majesty?
- Exactly. Very well put.

419
00:44:44,175 --> 00:44:48,388
- Too many notes.
- I don't understand.

420
00:44:48,596 --> 00:44:53,143
There are just as many notes
as I required, neither more nor less.

421
00:44:53,351 --> 00:44:56,020
My dear fellow, there are in fact...

422
00:44:56,229 --> 00:45:00,151
...only so many notes
the ear can hear in an evening.

423
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:06,407
I think I'm right in saying that,
aren't I, court composer?

424
00:45:07,366 --> 00:45:10,870
Yes. On the whole, yes, Majesty.

425
00:45:11,495 --> 00:45:13,080
This is absurd!

426
00:45:13,289 --> 00:45:17,543
Young man, don't take it too hard.
Your work is ingenious.

427
00:45:17,751 --> 00:45:19,420
It's quality work.

428
00:45:19,628 --> 00:45:25,176
And there are simply too many notes.
Just cut a few and it'll be perfect.

429
00:45:25,509 --> 00:45:27,678
Which few did you have in mind?

430
00:45:28,596 --> 00:45:30,389
Wolfgang!

431
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:34,185
Wolfgang, my dear!

432
00:45:35,853 --> 00:45:39,899
<i>- Wolfgang!
- Majesty, this is Frau Weber.</i>

433
00:45:40,107 --> 00:45:42,610
She's my landlady.

434
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:50,744
- Enchanted, madame.
- Sire, such an honor!

435
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,627
This is my dear daughter, Constanze.

436
00:45:57,835 --> 00:46:01,631
<i>- She's the fiancée of Herr Mozart.
- Really?</i>

437
00:46:06,093 --> 00:46:09,263
How charming. Please.

438
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,323
Well...

439
00:46:27,949 --> 00:46:30,243
...when do you marry?

440
00:46:32,203 --> 00:46:35,998
We haven't exactly received
my father's consent yet.

441
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:40,211
Not entirely. Not altogether.

442
00:46:42,922 --> 00:46:47,594
- Excuse me, but how old are you?
- 26.

443
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:52,599
My advice is for you to marry
this charming young lady...

444
00:46:52,808 --> 00:46:56,103
...and stay with us in Vienna.
- You see?

445
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:59,439
I told him that,
but he won't listen to me.

446
00:46:59,648 --> 00:47:03,443
Your Majesty,
you give such wonderful...

447
00:47:03,861 --> 00:47:08,365
...such royal advice. May I...?

448
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,545
Well, there it is.

449
00:47:21,629 --> 00:47:24,465
Wolfie, will you get some water?

450
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,096
Will you get some water, please?

451
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,686
Wolfie, get some water!

452
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,948
Excuse me. Excuse me.

453
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,416
Did you know?

454
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,920
- What?
- The marriage.

455
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,133
What does it matter to you?

456
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:11,180
Nothing. He can marry who he pleases,
I don't give a damn.

457
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,434
How was I?

458
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,729
You were sublime.

459
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:22,066
And what did you think of the music?

460
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,569
Extremely clever.

461
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,656
Katerina, I...

462
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,407
Excuse me.

463
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:34,829
Is that woman still lying
on the floor?

464
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:40,418
- No, she's fine.
- Oh, I'm so relieved.

465
00:48:41,254 --> 00:48:44,173
Dear Mozart,
my sincere congratulations.

466
00:48:44,966 --> 00:48:48,803
- Did you like it then?
- How could I not?

467
00:48:49,262 --> 00:48:52,890
It's the best music
in Vienna today, don't you agree?

468
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:56,227
She must be dazzling in bed.

469
00:48:58,354 --> 00:49:01,941
I assume she's the virtuoso
in that department.

470
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:06,028
No other reason why
you'd marry someone like that.

471
00:49:07,572 --> 00:49:09,031
Come in.

472
00:49:11,868 --> 00:49:15,663
Excuse me.
Wolfie, Mom isn't feeling very well.

473
00:49:15,872 --> 00:49:17,540
- Can we go home?
- Yes.

474
00:49:17,748 --> 00:49:21,002
No, no, no.
You can't take him away now.

475
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,963
This is his night.

476
00:49:24,172 --> 00:49:26,757
Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?

477
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:30,637
<i>Excuse us, Fräulein.
Good night, signore.</i>

478
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:37,311
<i>At that moment I knew,
beyond any doubt...</i>

479
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:39,605
<i>... he'd had her.</i>

480
00:49:39,813 --> 00:49:43,358
The creature had had my darling girl.

481
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:53,702
It was incomprehensible!

482
00:49:54,203 --> 00:49:56,872
What was God up to?

483
00:49:58,207 --> 00:50:01,376
Was it possible I was being tested?

484
00:50:02,419 --> 00:50:07,050
Was God expecting me
to offer forgiveness...

485
00:50:07,258 --> 00:50:10,053
...in the face of every offense?

486
00:50:10,261 --> 00:50:12,096
No matter how painful?

487
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:16,351
It's very possible.

488
00:50:16,809 --> 00:50:19,020
But why him?

489
00:50:19,896 --> 00:50:25,277
Why choose Mozart
to teach me lessons in humility?

490
00:50:25,986 --> 00:50:27,780
My heart was filling up...

491
00:50:27,988 --> 00:50:31,116
...with such hatred
for that little man.

492
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:36,372
For the first time in my life,
I began to know...

493
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,290
...really...

494
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:41,085
...violent thoughts.

495
00:50:42,253 --> 00:50:47,341
<i>Every day, sometimes for hours,
I would pray.</i>

496
00:50:48,634 --> 00:50:50,177
Lord...

497
00:50:51,345 --> 00:50:52,888
...please...

498
00:50:54,014 --> 00:50:55,808
...send him away...

499
00:50:56,016 --> 00:50:58,769
...back to Salzburg.

500
00:51:00,604 --> 00:51:02,898
For his sake...

501
00:51:03,691 --> 00:51:06,193
...as well as mine.

502
00:51:08,112 --> 00:51:12,199
- No! I won't have him back.
- But, Your Grace...

503
00:51:12,408 --> 00:51:17,789
Your son is an unprincipled,
spoiled, conceited brat!

504
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:21,209
Yes, sir...

505
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,129
...that is the truth.

506
00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:30,594
But don't blame him.
The fault is mine, entirely.

507
00:51:30,802 --> 00:51:33,764
I was too indulgent with him.

508
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:37,268
Please, Your Grace?

509
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:40,313
Give him one more chance?

510
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,983
You have leave to try.

511
00:51:44,192 --> 00:51:48,362
God bless, Your Grace!
I thank Your Grace.

512
00:51:48,571 --> 00:51:50,531
I thank you!

513
00:51:54,243 --> 00:51:58,623
<i>I write to you with urgent news.
I'm coming to Vienna.</i>

514
00:51:58,831 --> 00:52:02,710
<i>Take no further steps
towards marriage until we meet.</i>

515
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:07,048
<i>As you honor the father who has
devoted his life to yours...</i>

516
00:52:07,256 --> 00:52:10,176
<i>... do as I bid, and await my coming.</i>

517
00:52:23,649 --> 00:52:27,569
I now join you
in the holy bonds of matrimony.

518
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:31,365
Those whom God hath joined together...

519
00:52:31,573 --> 00:52:34,618
...let no man put asunder.

520
00:52:48,173 --> 00:52:49,550
<i>Beloved father:</i>

521
00:52:49,758 --> 00:52:55,264
<i>You say Vienna is the musicians ' city.
To conquer here is to conquer Europe.</i>

522
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:59,268
<i>With my wife I can do it.
One day, when I'm wealthy...</i>

523
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:02,939
<i>... you'll live with us,
and we'll be so happy.</i>

524
00:53:13,367 --> 00:53:17,204
Good morning.
This is my niece, Princess Elizabeth.

525
00:53:17,413 --> 00:53:18,664
Your Highness.

526
00:53:18,873 --> 00:53:22,209
She's asked me to recommend
a music instructor.

527
00:53:22,418 --> 00:53:26,172
- I've come up with an excellent idea.
- Your Majesty!

528
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:29,300
It would be such a tremendous honor!

529
00:53:29,508 --> 00:53:33,804
<i>I was thinking of Herr Mozart.
What is your view?</i>

530
00:53:35,306 --> 00:53:38,601
It's an interesting idea,
Majesty, but...

531
00:53:39,852 --> 00:53:41,520
Yes?

532
00:53:41,937 --> 00:53:45,357
My concern is to protect you...

533
00:53:45,566 --> 00:53:49,445
...from any hint of favoritism.

534
00:53:54,033 --> 00:53:55,534
Favoritism.

535
00:53:55,743 --> 00:53:58,370
- What is this?
- What is what?

536
00:53:58,579 --> 00:54:04,419
Why must I submit samples of my work
to a committee to teach a girl?

537
00:54:04,628 --> 00:54:07,380
Because His Majesty wishes it.

538
00:54:08,465 --> 00:54:10,842
Is the emperor angry with me?

539
00:54:11,051 --> 00:54:15,472
- Quite the contrary.
- Then why not appoint me to the post?

540
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,892
You are not
the only composer in Vienna.

541
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:22,395
No. But I'm the best.

542
00:54:23,313 --> 00:54:25,232
Mozart.

543
00:54:26,484 --> 00:54:30,112
A little modesty
might suit you better.

544
00:54:37,245 --> 00:54:39,247
Who is on this committee?

545
00:54:39,664 --> 00:54:44,293
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count
Orsini-Rosenberg and Salieri.

546
00:54:44,502 --> 00:54:49,048
Naturally, the Italians!
Of course, always the Italians!

547
00:54:49,507 --> 00:54:52,051
They're all musical idiots!

548
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:58,475
- And you want them to judge my music?
- Young man...

549
00:54:58,684 --> 00:55:02,688
...the issue is quite simple.
If you want this position...

550
00:55:02,896 --> 00:55:07,317
...you must submit your stuff,
along with all your colleagues.

551
00:55:07,526 --> 00:55:09,403
Must I?

552
00:55:10,904 --> 00:55:11,947
Well, I won't.

553
00:55:12,865 --> 00:55:15,367
How are we supposed to live?

554
00:55:16,952 --> 00:55:19,788
Do you want me to beg on the streets?

555
00:55:19,997 --> 00:55:22,040
Don't be stupid.

556
00:55:22,791 --> 00:55:25,836
- All they want to see is your work.
- Shit.

557
00:55:26,044 --> 00:55:30,966
- What's wrong with that?
- Shut up! Just shut up.

558
00:55:31,175 --> 00:55:35,470
One royal pupil,
and all of Vienna will come flocking.

559
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,890
They'll come anyway.

560
00:55:38,432 --> 00:55:42,060
- No, they won't.
- They love me here.

561
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:47,066
- I know how things work in this city.
- You know everything, don't you?

562
00:56:15,596 --> 00:56:17,264
- Yes?
- Excuse me, sir.

563
00:56:17,473 --> 00:56:20,434
- A lady insists on talking to you.
- Who?

564
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:24,188
She didn't say,
but she says it's urgent.

565
00:56:26,398 --> 00:56:28,567
Excuse me, my dear.

566
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,115
Your Excellency.

567
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,911
How can I help you?

568
00:56:43,917 --> 00:56:47,963
<i>- Frau Mozart?
- I've come on behalf of my husband.</i>

569
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:53,802
I brought samples of his work so he
can be considered for the appointment.

570
00:56:55,428 --> 00:56:59,558
How charming,
but why did he not come himself?

571
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:04,104
Well, he's terribly busy, sir.

572
00:57:07,566 --> 00:57:08,942
I understand.

573
00:57:11,444 --> 00:57:14,656
I will look at them the moment I can.

574
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:19,245
It will be an honor.
Please give him my warmest regards.

575
00:57:19,453 --> 00:57:23,833
Would it be too much trouble
to ask you to look at them now?

576
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:27,795
- While I wait.
- I'm afraid I'm not at leisure...

577
00:57:28,004 --> 00:57:30,548
...this precise moment.

578
00:57:30,756 --> 00:57:34,677
Leave them with me.
I assure you, they will be safe.

579
00:57:35,637 --> 00:57:38,724
I really cannot do that, sir.

580
00:57:39,391 --> 00:57:42,853
You see, he doesn't know I'm here.

581
00:57:44,563 --> 00:57:47,024
Then he didn't send you?

582
00:57:47,232 --> 00:57:50,903
No, sir. This was my own idea.

583
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,992
- I see.
- Sir, we're desperate.

584
00:57:57,951 --> 00:58:01,038
We really need this job.

585
00:58:01,246 --> 00:58:04,833
My husband spends far more
than he can ever earn.

586
00:58:05,042 --> 00:58:09,379
I don't mean that he's lazy,
because he works all day long.

587
00:58:09,588 --> 00:58:14,009
It's just that he's not practical.

588
00:58:14,384 --> 00:58:18,555
Money simply slips through
his fingers. It's ridiculous.

589
00:58:21,642 --> 00:58:24,394
Let me offer you some refreshment.

590
00:58:24,603 --> 00:58:26,939
Do you know what these are?

591
00:58:28,607 --> 00:58:32,028
<i>Capezzoli di Venere!
Nipples of Venus.</i>

592
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:38,034
They're Roman chestnuts in brandied
sugar. Try one. Go on, try one!

593
00:58:38,243 --> 00:58:40,787
They're quite surprising.

594
00:58:45,626 --> 00:58:47,586
They're wonderful!

595
00:58:49,547 --> 00:58:52,550
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.

596
00:58:52,758 --> 00:58:55,427
Don't keep calling me that.

597
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,931
Keeps me at such a distance.

598
00:58:59,598 --> 00:59:02,768
I wasn't born a court composer,
you know.

599
00:59:02,977 --> 00:59:05,104
I'm from a small town.

600
00:59:05,312 --> 00:59:07,439
Just like your husband.

601
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,778
Are you sure you can't...

602
00:59:12,987 --> 00:59:16,657
...leave this and come back again?

603
00:59:17,825 --> 00:59:20,744
It's very tempting, sir.

604
00:59:20,953 --> 00:59:24,249
But it's impossible, I'm afraid.

605
00:59:24,666 --> 00:59:27,836
He'd be frantic
if he knew they were missing.

606
00:59:28,044 --> 00:59:30,881
You see, they're all originals.

607
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:35,177
- Originals?
- Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.

608
00:59:46,897 --> 00:59:48,690
These...

609
00:59:48,899 --> 00:59:50,358
...are originals?

610
01:00:26,855 --> 01:00:28,315
<i>Astounding!</i>

611
01:00:28,857 --> 01:00:32,319
It was actually...
It was beyond belief.

612
01:00:33,111 --> 01:00:35,739
These were first and only...

613
01:00:36,365 --> 01:00:38,492
<i>... drafts of music.</i>

614
01:00:39,785 --> 01:00:45,374
<i>But they showed no corrections
of any kind. Not one.</i>

615
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:51,505
<i>He had simply written down music...</i>

616
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:54,675
...already finished in his head.

617
01:00:54,967 --> 01:01:00,472
Page after page of it.
As if he were just taking dictation.

618
01:01:07,187 --> 01:01:09,189
And music...

619
01:01:09,648 --> 01:01:13,444
...finished as no music
is ever finished.

620
01:01:16,531 --> 01:01:19,200
Displace one note...

621
01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:22,287
...and there would be diminishment.

622
01:01:23,496 --> 01:01:27,750
Displace one phrase,
and the structure would fall.

623
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:33,965
<i>It was clear to me...</i>

624
01:01:34,507 --> 01:01:38,512
<i>... that sound I had heard
in the archbishop 's palace...</i>

625
01:01:38,721 --> 01:01:41,682
<i>... had been no accident.</i>

626
01:01:42,516 --> 01:01:47,521
<i>Here again
was the very voice of God.</i>

627
01:01:51,692 --> 01:01:54,403
I was staring through the cage...

628
01:01:54,612 --> 01:01:58,282
...of those meticulous ink strokes...

629
01:01:59,617 --> 01:02:03,621
...at an absolute beauty.

630
01:02:19,012 --> 01:02:21,431
Is it not good?

631
01:02:26,144 --> 01:02:27,604
It is miraculous.

632
01:02:31,608 --> 01:02:36,029
Yes, he's very proud of his work.

633
01:02:38,365 --> 01:02:40,617
So you will help us?

634
01:02:42,702 --> 01:02:45,747
I dine with the emperor
tomorrow evening.

635
01:02:45,956 --> 01:02:49,417
One word from me and the post is his.

636
01:02:49,626 --> 01:02:52,420
Thank you, Your Excellency!
Thank you!

637
01:02:52,921 --> 01:02:55,215
Come back tonight.

638
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:58,928
- Tonight?
- Alone.

639
01:03:01,514 --> 01:03:02,765
What for?

640
01:03:04,393 --> 01:03:08,146
Some service
deserves service in return.

641
01:03:09,815 --> 01:03:11,483
No?

642
01:03:12,943 --> 01:03:16,738
- What do you mean?
- Isn't it obvious?

643
01:03:17,573 --> 01:03:20,868
It's a post all Vienna seeks.

644
01:03:21,076 --> 01:03:25,038
If you wish it for your husband,
come tonight.

645
01:03:25,539 --> 01:03:28,250
I'm a married woman, sir.

646
01:03:28,458 --> 01:03:30,127
Then don't.

647
01:03:30,669 --> 01:03:32,629
It's up to you.

648
01:03:33,213 --> 01:03:36,466
And not to be vague,
that is the price.

649
01:03:48,604 --> 01:03:51,940
<i>There is no God of mercy, Father.</i>

650
01:03:54,235 --> 01:03:57,155
Just a God of torture.

651
01:04:03,328 --> 01:04:05,371
Evening came.

652
01:04:06,456 --> 01:04:11,127
<i>I sat there, not knowing
whether she would return or not.</i>

653
01:04:11,753 --> 01:04:16,633
<i>I prayed as I had
never prayed before.</i>

654
01:04:17,634 --> 01:04:19,886
<i>Dear God...</i>

655
01:04:20,094 --> 01:04:22,472
<i>... enter me now.</i>

656
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:27,310
<i>Fill me with one piece of true music.</i>

657
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:32,816
<i>One piece with your breath in it,
so I know that you love me.</i>

658
01:04:33,108 --> 01:04:39,031
<i>Show me one sign of your favor,
and I will show mine to Mozart.</i>

659
01:04:39,782 --> 01:04:43,827
<i>I will get him the royal position.</i>

660
01:04:44,161 --> 01:04:45,996
Enter me.

661
01:04:46,205 --> 01:04:48,124
Please.

662
01:04:49,501 --> 01:04:51,670
Please!

663
01:04:58,343 --> 01:04:59,594
Yes?

664
01:05:03,849 --> 01:05:06,601
That lady is back, sir.

665
01:05:11,022 --> 01:05:12,274
Show her in.

666
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:47,602
Well?

667
01:05:49,103 --> 01:05:51,022
I'm here.

668
01:05:54,609 --> 01:05:57,988
My husband has gone to a concert.

669
01:05:58,697 --> 01:06:01,658
He didn't think I would enjoy it.

670
01:06:12,419 --> 01:06:15,214
Well, where shall we go?

671
01:06:16,423 --> 01:06:19,176
Should we stay here?

672
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:22,387
Well...

673
01:06:25,891 --> 01:06:28,769
Do you still want to look at these?

674
01:06:31,563 --> 01:06:34,817
Or don't we need to bother anymore?

675
01:06:36,694 --> 01:06:39,614
Suppose we don't, really.

676
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:38,717
Show this woman out.

677
01:08:00,197 --> 01:08:01,781
Stanzi.

678
01:08:03,408 --> 01:08:05,327
Stanzi.

679
01:08:11,082 --> 01:08:13,043
What is it?

680
01:08:13,877 --> 01:08:17,422
What's the matter? Tell me.

681
01:08:20,717 --> 01:08:22,637
Tell me.

682
01:08:28,059 --> 01:08:30,311
I love you.

683
01:08:31,187 --> 01:08:33,481
I love you.

684
01:08:34,732 --> 01:08:38,444
From now on, we are enemies.

685
01:08:38,653 --> 01:08:40,279
<i>You and I.</i>

686
01:08:40,488 --> 01:08:43,324
<i>Because you choose
for your instrument...</i>

687
01:08:43,533 --> 01:08:48,371
<i>... a boastful, lustful,
smutty, infantile boy...</i>

688
01:08:48,621 --> 01:08:54,545
<i>... and give me for reward only the
ability to recognize the incarnation.</i>

689
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:58,131
<i>Because you are unjust...</i>

690
01:08:58,507 --> 01:09:00,175
<i>... unfair...</i>

691
01:09:01,218 --> 01:09:03,387
<i>... unkind...</i>

692
01:09:03,595 --> 01:09:05,389
<i>... I will block you.</i>

693
01:09:05,597 --> 01:09:07,349
<i>I swear it.</i>

694
01:09:08,183 --> 01:09:11,687
<i>I will hinder and harm
your creature on earth...</i>

695
01:09:11,895 --> 01:09:14,231
<i>... as far as I am able.</i>

696
01:09:14,606 --> 01:09:18,152
I don't like to talk
against a fellow musician.

697
01:09:18,361 --> 01:09:19,863
Of course not.

698
01:09:20,071 --> 01:09:22,282
I have to tell you.

699
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:28,454
Mozart is not entirely to be trusted
alone with young ladies.

700
01:09:28,663 --> 01:09:30,540
Really?

701
01:09:30,748 --> 01:09:34,794
One of my own pupils,
a very young singer...

702
01:09:35,003 --> 01:09:37,046
...Maria Theresa Paradis...

703
01:09:37,255 --> 01:09:39,465
...told me she was...

704
01:09:41,134 --> 01:09:43,261
Well...

705
01:09:45,263 --> 01:09:47,515
Well, what?

706
01:09:48,183 --> 01:09:50,643
Molested, Majesty.

707
01:09:50,852 --> 01:09:54,147
Twice, in the course of
the same lesson.

708
01:09:58,818 --> 01:10:03,198
<i>There is a Herr Mozart
waiting for you in the salon.</i>

709
01:10:07,118 --> 01:10:10,079
<i>- Whom did they choose?
- Herr Zummer.</i>

710
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:12,541
<i>Herr Zummer?</i>

711
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:16,421
But the man's a fool!
He's a total mediocrity.

712
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:21,510
No, no. He has yet
to achieve mediocrity.

713
01:10:23,512 --> 01:10:27,641
I can't lose this post.
I simply can't.

714
01:10:28,934 --> 01:10:30,936
Excellency, please.

715
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:35,148
Let's go to the palace.
You can talk to the emperor...

716
01:10:35,357 --> 01:10:39,528
<i>...and tell him that Herr Zummer
is an awful choice.</i>

717
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:42,781
He could do musical harm
to the princess.

718
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:48,411
Between us, no one in the world
could do musical harm to the princess.

719
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:54,042
Look...

720
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:56,086
...I must have pupils.

721
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:59,130
Without pupils, I can't manage.

722
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:03,093
You don't mean
you're living in poverty?

723
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:06,639
No, but I'm broke.

724
01:11:06,848 --> 01:11:08,933
Well, how is this possible?

725
01:11:09,141 --> 01:11:12,144
I hear your concerts are
quite successful.

726
01:11:12,478 --> 01:11:15,523
They're stupendously successful.

727
01:11:15,731 --> 01:11:19,485
You can't get a seat.
But no one will hire me.

728
01:11:19,694 --> 01:11:21,487
They want to hear me play...

729
01:11:21,696 --> 01:11:26,450
...but they won't let me teach
their daughters, as if I was a fiend.

730
01:11:31,706 --> 01:11:33,708
Seriously...

731
01:11:33,916 --> 01:11:37,295
...is there any chance
you could manage a loan?

732
01:11:38,004 --> 01:11:42,174
Only for six months.
Eight, at the most.

733
01:11:42,426 --> 01:11:46,722
You expect your fortunes to change
in six or eight months?

734
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:49,600
As a matter of fact, I do.

735
01:11:50,434 --> 01:11:55,731
I am working on something that will
explode like a bomb all over Europe.

736
01:11:55,939 --> 01:12:01,237
I'll be the richest man in Vienna.
I'll pay you back double. Anything.

737
01:12:01,446 --> 01:12:03,448
You name the terms.

738
01:12:03,656 --> 01:12:05,783
Well, how exciting.

739
01:12:06,117 --> 01:12:08,369
Tell me more.

740
01:12:10,121 --> 01:12:14,083
- It's a bit of a secret.
- Come, come. I'm interested.

741
01:12:14,292 --> 01:12:16,920
This is delicious. What is it?

742
01:12:17,754 --> 01:12:20,673
It's cream cheese mixed with sugar...

743
01:12:20,882 --> 01:12:25,220
<i>...suffused with rum.
Crema Mascarpone Speciale.</i>

744
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:27,055
Italian.

745
01:12:27,263 --> 01:12:31,726
Forgive me. We all have
patriotic feelings of some kind.

746
01:12:32,018 --> 01:12:33,811
Two thou...

747
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:37,524
Two hundred florins.
That's all I need.

748
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:41,110
A hundred.

749
01:12:43,321 --> 01:12:44,781
Fifty.

750
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:49,035
What exactly are you working on?

751
01:12:51,496 --> 01:12:54,875
Really, I can't say.

752
01:12:55,584 --> 01:13:01,757
I don't think you should become known
in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart.

753
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:10,392
However...

754
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:14,771
...I know a distinguished
gentleman I can recommend, and...

755
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:16,273
...he has a daughter.

756
01:13:21,111 --> 01:13:23,780
Quiet! Quiet!

757
01:13:23,989 --> 01:13:26,074
<i>Herr Mozart.</i>

758
01:13:26,283 --> 01:13:29,995
Welcome. Pay no attention,
they're impossible.

759
01:13:30,203 --> 01:13:33,456
I treat them just like
my own children.

760
01:13:34,249 --> 01:13:37,252
Which of them do you wish me to teach?

761
01:13:40,672 --> 01:13:42,841
That's funny.

762
01:13:43,508 --> 01:13:46,303
You're a funny fellow.

763
01:13:46,512 --> 01:13:51,017
This is the instrument.
I hope it's to your satisfaction.

764
01:13:51,225 --> 01:13:54,270
Of course it'll be
to his satisfaction.

765
01:13:54,478 --> 01:13:58,357
Come, we're going to listen
to some music. Come!

766
01:13:59,025 --> 01:14:01,027
Good boy.

767
01:14:06,657 --> 01:14:08,159
Now.

768
01:14:08,367 --> 01:14:12,580
Please play me something,
just to give me an idea.

769
01:14:13,539 --> 01:14:15,750
Anything will do.

770
01:14:17,084 --> 01:14:18,377
Just go ahead.

771
01:14:18,586 --> 01:14:21,505
Just as if we weren't here.

772
01:14:22,798 --> 01:14:27,762
<i>Part of music, getting used
to an audience. Right, Herr Mozart?</i>

773
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:31,516
Perhaps it would be better
if we were left alone.

774
01:14:31,724 --> 01:14:33,726
We're both a little shy.

775
01:14:33,935 --> 01:14:35,187
Play.

776
01:14:35,395 --> 01:14:38,607
- I said play!
- Michael, please.

777
01:14:38,815 --> 01:14:43,154
<i>Perhaps if I play first,
it might encourage the Fräulein.</i>

778
01:14:43,613 --> 01:14:45,949
Why don't you let me try?

779
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:59,629
Stop it! Stop!
He always howls when he hears music.

780
01:14:59,837 --> 01:15:02,674
We've got to break him of that habit.

781
01:15:02,882 --> 01:15:06,344
We've got to break them
of their habit!

782
01:15:06,553 --> 01:15:07,845
Play. Please.

783
01:15:08,304 --> 01:15:12,559
<i>Herr Mozart, play. Please, I beg you.</i>

784
01:15:19,899 --> 01:15:22,110
That's it. That's it.

785
01:15:25,071 --> 01:15:27,365
Keep playing!

786
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:36,333
Keep playing! That's it!

787
01:15:55,769 --> 01:15:59,023
Mozart, that's wonderful!
Wonderful!

788
01:15:59,231 --> 01:16:04,112
Next time you wish me to instruct
another of your dogs, let me know.

789
01:16:04,321 --> 01:16:07,991
<i>Goodbye, Fräulein. Goodbye, madam.
Goodbye, sir.</i>

790
01:17:05,216 --> 01:17:07,093
Papa?

791
01:17:10,888 --> 01:17:12,598
Papa!

792
01:17:16,644 --> 01:17:18,521
Why are you here?

793
01:17:18,729 --> 01:17:20,439
Am I not welcome?

794
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:25,279
Of course, welcome.
Papa, welcome! Welcome!

795
01:17:46,843 --> 01:17:50,597
You're very thin.
Doesn't your wife feed you?

796
01:17:50,805 --> 01:17:55,143
Of course she feeds me.
She stuffs me like a goose all day!

797
01:17:56,227 --> 01:17:59,939
- Is she not here?
- No, she had to help her mother.

798
01:18:00,148 --> 01:18:01,941
She's like that.

799
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:05,195
Her mother's a very
sweet woman, you'Il...

800
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:16,248
I didn't know you were home.

801
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:19,585
Stanzi, this is my father.

802
01:18:21,879 --> 01:18:25,341
We'll wait. We'll wait.

803
01:18:27,259 --> 01:18:30,429
Why don't you get up now, my darling?

804
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:41,190
She's very tired, poor creature.
You know me. I'm such a pig.

805
01:18:41,398 --> 01:18:44,318
It's not easy cleaning up after me.

806
01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:47,196
Don't you have a maid?

807
01:18:47,404 --> 01:18:51,116
Oh. No. We could if we wanted...

808
01:18:51,325 --> 01:18:55,664
...but Stanzi insists on doing
everything herself.

809
01:18:56,122 --> 01:18:58,375
How is your...

810
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:01,670
...financial situation?

811
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,005
Couldn't be better.

812
01:19:04,839 --> 01:19:06,925
That's not what I hear.

813
01:19:07,133 --> 01:19:10,095
What do you mean? It's wonderful.

814
01:19:10,304 --> 01:19:14,642
Really, it's marvelous!
People love me here.

815
01:19:15,226 --> 01:19:17,979
They say you have debts.

816
01:19:18,354 --> 01:19:19,856
Who?

817
01:19:20,439 --> 01:19:22,400
Who says that?

818
01:19:22,608 --> 01:19:24,944
That's a malicious lie!

819
01:19:25,152 --> 01:19:27,363
Do you have pupils?

820
01:19:27,947 --> 01:19:30,950
I don't want pupils!

821
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,619
They get in the way.

822
01:19:34,745 --> 01:19:37,582
I have to have time for composition.

823
01:19:37,915 --> 01:19:40,835
Composition doesn't pay.
You know that.

824
01:19:41,043 --> 01:19:43,004
That one will.

825
01:19:43,629 --> 01:19:45,506
What's that?

826
01:19:46,924 --> 01:19:48,676
It's a secret.

827
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:51,888
Secret?
You don't have secrets from me.

828
01:19:53,347 --> 01:19:58,769
No! Please! I don't want you to see it.
I don't want anyone to see it.

829
01:19:58,978 --> 01:20:01,022
You'll be so proud of me.

830
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:05,736
It'll be the best thing I've
ever done. The best thing anyone...

831
01:20:08,071 --> 01:20:09,406
There she is!

832
01:20:09,615 --> 01:20:13,785
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful?
Now, Papa, confess it.

833
01:20:13,994 --> 01:20:18,665
- Could you want a prettier daughter?
- Stop it, Wolfie!

834
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:21,586
I look dreadful.

835
01:20:22,754 --> 01:20:24,297
Are you...

836
01:20:24,505 --> 01:20:26,674
...expecting?

837
01:20:26,883 --> 01:20:30,845
- Yes, I am.
- Isn't it marvelous? We're delighted.

838
01:20:31,804 --> 01:20:36,226
- May I offer you some tea?
- Who wants tea? Let's go out!

839
01:20:36,434 --> 01:20:40,230
This calls for a feast.
You don't want tea, do you?

840
01:20:40,438 --> 01:20:44,734
I know! Let's go dancing.
Papa loves parties, don't you?

841
01:20:44,943 --> 01:20:48,238
How can you be so boring? Tea!

842
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:54,410
Come on, Papa. Hurry!

843
01:20:54,619 --> 01:20:56,412
Here we go. Good day.

844
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:40,624
Now!

845
01:21:46,255 --> 01:21:50,886
I name the penalty!
I name the penalty!

846
01:21:51,678 --> 01:21:54,473
And the penalty is...

847
01:21:54,682 --> 01:21:58,769
- Give her a good one!
- Show us your legs!

848
01:22:03,149 --> 01:22:05,443
Come on, come on!

849
01:22:18,039 --> 01:22:20,666
It's just a game, Papa.

850
01:22:33,429 --> 01:22:35,097
Thank you.

851
01:22:59,706 --> 01:23:04,044
<i>Herr Mozart, why don't you
name your son's penalty?!</i>

852
01:23:06,129 --> 01:23:09,258
Yes, Papa. Name it.

853
01:23:09,758 --> 01:23:14,055
Name it. I'll do anything
you say. Anything.

854
01:23:15,431 --> 01:23:19,310
I want you to come back
to Salzburg with me.

855
01:23:19,519 --> 01:23:23,064
The penalty must be
performed in the room.

856
01:23:23,273 --> 01:23:25,191
I'm tired of this game.

857
01:23:25,608 --> 01:23:30,154
But my penalty!
I've got to have a penalty!

858
01:23:34,742 --> 01:23:36,911
I name a penalty!

859
01:23:39,789 --> 01:23:41,166
The penalty is...

860
01:23:41,709 --> 01:23:43,919
...you shall play our tune...

861
01:23:44,128 --> 01:23:48,757
...in the manner of
Johann Sebastian Bach!

862
01:24:15,659 --> 01:24:18,579
- Turn him over!
- Over?!

863
01:24:20,539 --> 01:24:23,292
Now you play it backwards!

864
01:24:50,696 --> 01:24:55,201
- Another one! Give me another one!
- Play it like Gluck!

865
01:24:55,409 --> 01:24:58,162
- Boring. Another!
- Handel!

866
01:24:58,371 --> 01:25:00,831
I don't like him! Another one!

867
01:25:01,332 --> 01:25:03,543
Play Salieri.

868
01:25:04,293 --> 01:25:07,880
Now that is a challenge!
That is a challenge.

869
01:25:08,339 --> 01:25:11,092
Please! Please!

870
01:25:45,627 --> 01:25:48,505
Go on. Mock me. Laugh!

871
01:25:53,468 --> 01:25:56,346
That was not Mozart laughing, Father.

872
01:25:56,555 --> 01:25:58,181
That was God.

873
01:25:58,390 --> 01:26:03,061
That was God laughing at me
through that obscene giggle.

874
01:26:06,316 --> 01:26:08,818
<i>Go on, Signore. Laugh.</i>

875
01:26:09,027 --> 01:26:13,239
Show my mediocrity for all to see.

876
01:26:14,616 --> 01:26:17,493
One day I will laugh at you.

877
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:23,500
Before I leave this earth...

878
01:26:23,709 --> 01:26:26,503
...I will laugh at you.

879
01:26:48,275 --> 01:26:50,945
- Wolfie?
- What?

880
01:26:51,987 --> 01:26:54,907
There's a young girl here to see you.

881
01:26:55,115 --> 01:26:56,617
What does she want?

882
01:26:56,825 --> 01:27:01,372
She won't talk to me.
She says she has to speak to you.

883
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:04,291
Damn.

884
01:27:09,213 --> 01:27:10,506
Yes?

885
01:27:12,383 --> 01:27:15,302
<i>- Are you Herr Mozart?
- That's right.</i>

886
01:27:17,097 --> 01:27:20,934
My name is Lorl, sir.
I'm a maidservant.

887
01:27:21,142 --> 01:27:25,105
I was asked to come here
and offer my services to you.

888
01:27:25,313 --> 01:27:30,485
They'll be paid for by an admirer
of yours who wishes to remain...

889
01:27:30,694 --> 01:27:32,655
...anonymous.

890
01:27:33,322 --> 01:27:36,200
Is this your idea, Papa?

891
01:27:37,159 --> 01:27:38,411
Mine?

892
01:27:38,619 --> 01:27:42,957
- Are you playing a trick on me?
- I've never seen this girl.

893
01:27:43,875 --> 01:27:47,503
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Not at all, sir.

894
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:50,089
Young woman, this won't do.

895
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:54,719
My son can't accept such an offer,
no matter how generous...

896
01:27:54,927 --> 01:27:59,432
...unless he knows who's behind it.
- I can't tell you that, sir.

897
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:02,852
- This is ridiculous!
- What is ridiculous?

898
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:05,771
Wolfie has many admirers in Vienna.

899
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:08,733
People send us gifts all the time.

900
01:28:08,941 --> 01:28:11,987
You cannot accept her
without references.

901
01:28:12,195 --> 01:28:15,157
Well, this is none of your business.

902
01:28:15,365 --> 01:28:19,119
- Whoever sent you is going to pay?
- That's right.

903
01:28:19,328 --> 01:28:23,707
Splendid! Now we're going
to let a stranger into our house.

904
01:28:23,916 --> 01:28:27,085
Who is we? Who is letting who...?

905
01:28:30,672 --> 01:28:34,593
- Could you please wait outside?
- Yes, ma'am.

906
01:28:34,801 --> 01:28:36,136
Look, old man!

907
01:28:36,345 --> 01:28:40,849
We spend a fortune on you,
and all you can do is criticize.

908
01:28:41,058 --> 01:28:42,309
- And now...
- Stanzi!

909
01:28:42,517 --> 01:28:47,022
No! It's right that he should hear!
I'm sick to death of it.

910
01:28:47,231 --> 01:28:50,734
We can't do anything
right for you, can we?

911
01:28:50,943 --> 01:28:54,780
You won't have to do anything
for me ever again.

912
01:28:54,988 --> 01:28:56,657
I'm leaving.

913
01:28:56,865 --> 01:28:59,994
- No, Papa.
- I won't stay and be a burden.

914
01:29:00,203 --> 01:29:02,121
No one calls you that.

915
01:29:02,330 --> 01:29:05,793
She does. She says I sleep all day.

916
01:29:06,001 --> 01:29:07,836
And so you do!

917
01:29:08,128 --> 01:29:11,257
The only time you come out is to eat.

918
01:29:12,508 --> 01:29:14,760
Well, what do you expect?

919
01:29:16,971 --> 01:29:21,809
Do you expect anyone to walk out
into a mess like this every day?

920
01:29:22,017 --> 01:29:26,814
- So now I'm a bad housekeeper!
- So you are. It's a pigsty.

921
01:29:27,022 --> 01:29:29,233
When can you start?

922
01:29:29,441 --> 01:29:31,652
- Right away, ma'am.
- Good.

923
01:29:58,805 --> 01:30:01,558
They're out every night, sir.

924
01:30:03,935 --> 01:30:05,937
Thank you, sir.

925
01:30:06,521 --> 01:30:09,691
Do any pupils come to the house?

926
01:30:11,735 --> 01:30:13,778
Not that I've seen.

927
01:30:13,987 --> 01:30:16,781
Then how does he pay for all this?

928
01:30:17,782 --> 01:30:20,118
Does he work at all?

929
01:30:20,327 --> 01:30:26,250
Yes, sir. All day long. He never
leaves the house till evening.

930
01:30:26,459 --> 01:30:29,503
He just sits there,
writing and writing.

931
01:30:29,712 --> 01:30:31,505
Really?

932
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,134
What is it he's writing?

933
01:30:38,137 --> 01:30:40,681
I wouldn't know that, sir.

934
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:42,683
Of course not.

935
01:30:42,892 --> 01:30:44,894
You're a good girl.

936
01:30:45,102 --> 01:30:47,521
You're very kind to do this.

937
01:30:47,730 --> 01:30:52,361
The next time you're sure they'll
be out of the house, let me know.

938
01:30:59,243 --> 01:31:01,787
Thank you, sir.

939
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:44,434
I think I found out
about the money, sir.

940
01:32:45,227 --> 01:32:47,771
Yes? What?

941
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:52,984
He kept seven snuffboxes in here.
I could swear they were all gold.

942
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:55,487
And now look.

943
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:57,822
There's only one left.

944
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:01,326
Where does he work?

945
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:05,080
In there, sir.

946
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:53,922
Gentlemen, I've just
heard some news...

947
01:33:54,381 --> 01:33:57,467
...that may interest you.
- What?

948
01:33:57,634 --> 01:34:02,014
Mozart is writing a new opera.
An Italian opera.

949
01:34:02,514 --> 01:34:04,683
Italian?

950
01:34:05,434 --> 01:34:09,688
That's not all.
He has chosen for his subject, Figaro.

951
01:34:10,314 --> 01:34:13,108
<i>The Marriage of Figaro.</i>

952
01:34:13,317 --> 01:34:16,862
He's setting that play to music?

953
01:34:17,279 --> 01:34:18,530
Yes.

954
01:34:19,781 --> 01:34:23,243
<i>What is this Marriage of Figaro?</i>

955
01:34:23,452 --> 01:34:26,914
It's a French play, Kapellmeister.

956
01:34:27,122 --> 01:34:30,335
It has been banned by the emperor.

957
01:34:30,543 --> 01:34:32,587
You're absolutely sure?

958
01:34:36,174 --> 01:34:38,509
<i>Herr Mozart.</i>

959
01:34:39,469 --> 01:34:41,596
Gentlemen, sit down.

960
01:34:46,393 --> 01:34:48,062
Mozart.

961
01:34:49,313 --> 01:34:53,567
<i>Are you aware that I have declared
the French play Figaro...</i>

962
01:34:53,776 --> 01:34:56,654
...unsuitable for our theater?

963
01:34:57,821 --> 01:34:59,615
Yes, sire.

964
01:34:59,823 --> 01:35:04,995
Yet we hear you're making an
opera from it. Is this true?

965
01:35:08,624 --> 01:35:10,834
Who told you this, Majesty?

966
01:35:11,043 --> 01:35:15,714
It is not your place to ask questions.
Is it true?

967
01:35:15,923 --> 01:35:17,925
Yes, I...

968
01:35:18,342 --> 01:35:20,636
I admit it is.

969
01:35:22,722 --> 01:35:25,267
Would you tell me why?

970
01:35:27,310 --> 01:35:29,771
Majesty, it is only a comedy.

971
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:32,774
What you think is scarcely the point.

972
01:35:32,983 --> 01:35:36,736
It's what His Majesty thinks
that counts.

973
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:39,114
But, Your Majesty...

974
01:35:39,322 --> 01:35:41,199
Mozart...

975
01:35:41,408 --> 01:35:43,618
...I am a tolerant man.

976
01:35:43,827 --> 01:35:48,790
I do not censor things lightly.
When I do, I have good reason.

977
01:35:49,624 --> 01:35:52,627
<i>Figaro is a bad play.</i>

978
01:35:53,253 --> 01:35:55,964
It stirs up hatred between classes.

979
01:35:56,172 --> 01:35:59,217
In France, it has caused
only bitterness.

980
01:35:59,426 --> 01:36:04,764
My sister Antoinette is beginning
to be frightened of her own people.

981
01:36:04,973 --> 01:36:08,560
I swear, there's nothing
like that in the piece.

982
01:36:08,768 --> 01:36:13,691
I've taken out everything that could
give offense. I hate politics.

983
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:16,445
I'm afraid you're rather innocent.

984
01:36:16,653 --> 01:36:21,783
In these dangerous times I cannot
afford to provoke our people...

985
01:36:21,992 --> 01:36:24,328
...simply over a theater piece.

986
01:36:24,536 --> 01:36:29,583
Majesty, this is just a frolic.
A piece about love.

987
01:36:29,791 --> 01:36:31,793
"Love." Again!

988
01:36:32,169 --> 01:36:33,837
And it's new!

989
01:36:34,046 --> 01:36:38,091
It's entirely new.
The people will go mad for it.

990
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:40,552
I have scenes...

991
01:36:41,303 --> 01:36:43,805
The end of Act II, for example.

992
01:36:44,014 --> 01:36:48,018
It starts as a duet.
A husband and wife quarreling.

993
01:36:48,227 --> 01:36:53,357
Suddenly, the scheming maid comes in.
It's a very funny situation.

994
01:36:53,565 --> 01:36:55,400
Duet turns into trio.

995
01:36:55,609 --> 01:36:58,487
Then the husband's valet comes in.

996
01:36:58,695 --> 01:37:00,489
Trio turns into quartet.

997
01:37:00,697 --> 01:37:03,659
Then a gardener.
Quartet becomes quintet.

998
01:37:03,867 --> 01:37:05,869
And so on, on and on.

999
01:37:06,078 --> 01:37:08,664
Sextet, septet, octet.

1000
01:37:08,872 --> 01:37:12,627
How long do you think
I can sustain that?

1001
01:37:13,419 --> 01:37:14,879
I have no idea.

1002
01:37:15,088 --> 01:37:16,464
Guess.

1003
01:37:17,423 --> 01:37:18,883
Guess, Your Majesty.

1004
01:37:19,092 --> 01:37:24,097
Imagine the longest time
it could be sustained, then double it.

1005
01:37:24,931 --> 01:37:26,599
Well...

1006
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:29,519
Six...

1007
01:37:30,395 --> 01:37:32,647
...seven minutes?

1008
01:37:35,358 --> 01:37:39,780
- Eight minutes?
- Twenty, sire. Twenty minutes!

1009
01:37:39,989 --> 01:37:44,326
Twenty minutes of continuous music.
No recitatives!

1010
01:37:44,785 --> 01:37:47,162
Sire, only opera can do this.

1011
01:37:47,371 --> 01:37:51,292
In a play, if more than one person
speaks at once...

1012
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,460
...it's just noise.

1013
01:37:53,669 --> 01:37:56,213
But with opera, with music...

1014
01:37:56,422 --> 01:38:00,593
...you can have 20 individuals
all talking at the same time.

1015
01:38:00,801 --> 01:38:03,805
It's not noise.
It's a perfect harmony!

1016
01:38:04,222 --> 01:38:07,350
Mozart, music is not the issue here.

1017
01:38:07,559 --> 01:38:12,856
No one doubts your talent. It's your
literary judgment that's in question.

1018
01:38:13,064 --> 01:38:19,112
Even with the politics taken out,
it would still remain a vulgar farce.

1019
01:38:19,321 --> 01:38:22,157
Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?

1020
01:38:22,365 --> 01:38:26,411
Surely you can choose more
elevated themes.

1021
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:29,789
Elevated!
What does that mean, elevated?

1022
01:38:29,998 --> 01:38:33,752
I am fed to the teeth with these...

1023
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:37,213
...elevated things. Old dead legends.

1024
01:38:37,422 --> 01:38:41,551
Why must we go on forever
writing of gods and legends?

1025
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,762
Because they do.

1026
01:38:44,262 --> 01:38:46,765
They go on forever.

1027
01:38:47,515 --> 01:38:51,436
At least what they represent:
The eternal in us.

1028
01:38:51,686 --> 01:38:54,439
Opera is here to ennoble us, Mozart.

1029
01:38:54,648 --> 01:38:59,195
You and me,
just the same as His Majesty.

1030
01:39:02,031 --> 01:39:06,787
<i>"Bello, bello, bello."
Come on now, be honest!</i>

1031
01:39:06,995 --> 01:39:12,668
You'd rather listen to your hairdresser
than Hercules, Horatius or Orpheus.

1032
01:39:12,876 --> 01:39:16,922
People so lofty, they sound
as if they shit marble!

1033
01:39:17,714 --> 01:39:19,424
What!

1034
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:23,845
Govern your tongue, Mozart!
How dare you!

1035
01:39:28,308 --> 01:39:31,144
Forgive me, Majesty.

1036
01:39:32,354 --> 01:39:34,773
I'm a vulgar man...

1037
01:39:34,982 --> 01:39:38,193
...but I assure you, my music is not.

1038
01:39:41,822 --> 01:39:45,033
You are passionate, Mozart...

1039
01:39:45,242 --> 01:39:49,204
...but you do not persuade.

1040
01:39:51,708 --> 01:39:55,545
Sire, the whole opera is finished.

1041
01:39:55,795 --> 01:39:59,048
Do you know how much work
went into it?

1042
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:04,679
<i>His Majesty has been
more than patient, Signore.</i>

1043
01:40:05,847 --> 01:40:09,100
How can I persuade if I can't show it?

1044
01:40:09,309 --> 01:40:12,353
<i>That will do, Herr Mozart.</i>

1045
01:40:14,230 --> 01:40:17,108
Just let me tell you how it begins.

1046
01:40:17,317 --> 01:40:21,195
May I just do that, Majesty?
Show you how it begins? Just that?

1047
01:40:26,701 --> 01:40:28,077
Please.

1048
01:40:29,078 --> 01:40:30,873
Look...

1049
01:40:31,165 --> 01:40:34,627
There's a servant on his knees.
Do you know why?

1050
01:40:34,835 --> 01:40:38,255
Not from oppression.
He's measuring a space.

1051
01:40:38,464 --> 01:40:40,507
Do you know what for?

1052
01:40:40,716 --> 01:40:43,427
His bed. His wedding bed.

1053
01:40:43,636 --> 01:40:45,931
To see if it will fit!

1054
01:40:54,564 --> 01:40:56,191
Late.

1055
01:40:58,109 --> 01:40:59,736
Late!

1056
01:41:00,153 --> 01:41:01,780
On the beat.

1057
01:41:01,988 --> 01:41:03,657
Good!

1058
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:07,369
Yes!

1059
01:41:13,833 --> 01:41:15,502
Early!

1060
01:41:19,756 --> 01:41:23,510
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.

1061
01:41:28,598 --> 01:41:31,851
In that case, gentlemen, I think...

1062
01:41:35,981 --> 01:41:39,150
I think we should help
Mozart all we can.

1063
01:41:42,405 --> 01:41:45,658
And protect him against
the emperor's anger.

1064
01:41:45,866 --> 01:41:47,743
What anger?

1065
01:41:47,952 --> 01:41:50,204
About the ballet.

1066
01:41:50,913 --> 01:41:53,249
What ballet?

1067
01:41:53,708 --> 01:41:55,877
Excuse me...

1068
01:41:56,128 --> 01:42:01,341
...but didn't His Majesty specifically
forbid the ballet in his opera?

1069
01:42:38,421 --> 01:42:40,757
<i>- Herr Mozart!
- Yes?</i>

1070
01:42:40,965 --> 01:42:44,093
<i>- A word with you.
- Certainly, Herr Direktor.</i>

1071
01:42:44,302 --> 01:42:46,179
<i>Now, Herr Mozart!</i>

1072
01:42:47,138 --> 01:42:49,015
Five minutes, please.

1073
01:42:49,182 --> 01:42:50,558
Five minutes!

1074
01:42:52,185 --> 01:42:53,436
Yes?

1075
01:42:53,645 --> 01:42:59,400
Do you not know that His Majesty has
expressly forbidden ballet in operas?

1076
01:42:59,609 --> 01:43:04,530
- It's not a ballet, it's a dance.
- Exactly. A dance.

1077
01:43:04,739 --> 01:43:09,410
Surely, His Majesty didn't mean
no dancing when it's in the story.

1078
01:43:09,619 --> 01:43:15,083
It's dangerous to interpret his
edicts. Give me your score, please.

1079
01:43:23,968 --> 01:43:25,678
Thank you.

1080
01:43:28,848 --> 01:43:31,851
<i>What are you doing, Herr Direktor?</i>

1081
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:35,689
Taking out what you should
never have put in.

1082
01:43:36,815 --> 01:43:39,526
Please. Please!

1083
01:43:39,901 --> 01:43:42,362
I have no one else to turn to.

1084
01:43:42,571 --> 01:43:45,240
- What is it?
- It's unbelievable.

1085
01:43:45,448 --> 01:43:49,619
<i>The direktor has torn up
a huge section of my music.</i>

1086
01:43:49,828 --> 01:43:53,039
They say I have to rewrite the opera.

1087
01:43:53,665 --> 01:43:56,167
But it's perfect as it is.

1088
01:43:56,376 --> 01:43:57,627
I can't...

1089
01:43:57,836 --> 01:44:00,422
...rewrite what's perfect.

1090
01:44:02,215 --> 01:44:03,592
Please.

1091
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:06,177
Can't you talk to him?

1092
01:44:06,678 --> 01:44:07,929
Please.

1093
01:44:08,138 --> 01:44:10,932
Why bother?
He's no friend of yours.

1094
01:44:11,141 --> 01:44:14,853
I could kill him!
I mean, really! Kill him!

1095
01:44:16,855 --> 01:44:20,984
I threw the entire score into
the fire, he made me so angry.

1096
01:44:21,192 --> 01:44:26,490
- You burned the score?
- No, my wife took it out in time.

1097
01:44:28,075 --> 01:44:29,452
Thank God.

1098
01:44:31,162 --> 01:44:36,208
It's unfair that a man like that
should have power over our work!

1099
01:44:37,543 --> 01:44:40,922
But there are those
who have power over him.

1100
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:45,968
I think I'll take this up
with the emperor.

1101
01:44:47,887 --> 01:44:49,389
Excellency...

1102
01:44:49,598 --> 01:44:50,849
...would you?

1103
01:44:52,517 --> 01:44:55,395
With all my heart, Mozart.

1104
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,982
Thank you.

1105
01:44:59,191 --> 01:45:04,154
<i>Please, Herr Mozart.
"Please, it's not a holy relic."</i>

1106
01:45:06,365 --> 01:45:11,119
I don't need to tell you I said
nothing, whatever, to the emperor.

1107
01:45:11,328 --> 01:45:16,042
I went to the theater to tell
Mozart something, anything...

1108
01:45:17,543 --> 01:45:22,257
<i>... when suddenly,
in the middle of the third act...</i>

1109
01:45:22,465 --> 01:45:25,635
<i>... to my astonishment, the emperor...</i>

1110
01:45:25,843 --> 01:45:30,431
<i>... who never attended rehearsals,
suddenly appeared.</i>

1111
01:45:49,117 --> 01:45:51,244
What is this?

1112
01:45:53,705 --> 01:45:55,665
I don't understand.

1113
01:45:56,708 --> 01:45:58,126
Is it modern?

1114
01:45:59,168 --> 01:46:00,878
Majesty...

1115
01:46:01,129 --> 01:46:02,839
<i>...the Herr Direktor...</i>

1116
01:46:03,047 --> 01:46:05,967
<i>...he has removed un balletto...</i>

1117
01:46:06,175 --> 01:46:10,639
...that would have occurred
at this place.

1118
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:13,100
Why?

1119
01:46:13,392 --> 01:46:15,562
It is your regulation, sire.

1120
01:46:15,770 --> 01:46:18,815
No ballet in your opera.

1121
01:46:24,571 --> 01:46:26,323
Salieri.

1122
01:46:27,699 --> 01:46:29,409
Do you like this?

1123
01:46:31,828 --> 01:46:35,624
It's not a question
of liking, Majesty.

1124
01:46:35,832 --> 01:46:38,877
Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.

1125
01:46:40,629 --> 01:46:42,881
Well, look at them!

1126
01:46:45,008 --> 01:46:48,219
No! This is nonsense!

1127
01:46:48,428 --> 01:46:52,474
- Let me see the scene with the music.
- But, sire!

1128
01:46:52,682 --> 01:46:54,142
Oblige me!

1129
01:46:54,351 --> 01:46:56,394
Yes, Majesty.

1130
01:47:05,446 --> 01:47:08,741
Can we see the scene
with the music, please?

1131
01:47:08,950 --> 01:47:12,286
<i>Certainly! Certainly, Herr Direktor!</i>

1132
01:47:17,875 --> 01:47:20,628
Bring the palace set back in, please.

1133
01:47:58,710 --> 01:48:00,420
The restored third act...

1134
01:48:00,628 --> 01:48:03,047
...was bold, brilliant.

1135
01:48:03,881 --> 01:48:05,883
The fourth...

1136
01:48:08,344 --> 01:48:10,305
...was astounding.

1137
01:48:18,354 --> 01:48:19,814
<i>I saw a woman...</i>

1138
01:48:20,023 --> 01:48:25,820
<i>... disguised in her maid's clothes
hear her husband speak the first...</i>

1139
01:48:26,029 --> 01:48:29,449
<i>... tender words he has
offered her in years.</i>

1140
01:48:29,657 --> 01:48:34,370
<i>Simply because he thinks
she is someone else.</i>

1141
01:48:35,038 --> 01:48:40,501
<i>I heard the music of true forgiveness
filling the theater...</i>

1142
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:45,214
<i>... conferring on all who sat there,
perfect absolution.</i>

1143
01:48:45,965 --> 01:48:49,135
<i>God was singing through
this little man...</i>

1144
01:48:49,344 --> 01:48:51,889
<i>... to all the world.</i>

1145
01:48:52,514 --> 01:48:54,475
<i>Unstoppable.</i>

1146
01:48:54,683 --> 01:49:00,105
<i>Making my defeat more bitter
with every passing bar.</i>

1147
01:49:38,311 --> 01:49:41,064
And then, do you know what happened?

1148
01:49:44,234 --> 01:49:45,820
A miracle!

1149
01:49:52,910 --> 01:49:54,287
<i>With that yawn...</i>

1150
01:49:54,704 --> 01:49:58,666
<i>... I saw my defeat
turn into a victory.</i>

1151
01:50:02,461 --> 01:50:06,257
<i>Mozart was lucky
the emperor yawned only once.</i>

1152
01:50:06,465 --> 01:50:07,925
<i>Three yawns...</i>

1153
01:50:08,134 --> 01:50:11,178
...and the opera
would fail the same night.

1154
01:50:11,387 --> 01:50:14,724
Two yawns, within a week at most.

1155
01:50:14,932 --> 01:50:19,895
With one yawn, the composer
could still get...

1156
01:50:21,606 --> 01:50:26,402
Nine performances! Nine!
That's all it's had! Withdrawn!

1157
01:50:26,611 --> 01:50:28,905
I know, I know.

1158
01:50:29,155 --> 01:50:30,907
It's outrageous.

1159
01:50:32,533 --> 01:50:36,288
Still, if the public
doesn't like one's work...

1160
01:50:36,622 --> 01:50:39,166
...one has to accept
the fact gracefully.

1161
01:50:39,375 --> 01:50:42,420
But what is it that they don't like?

1162
01:50:42,962 --> 01:50:45,340
I can speak for the emperor.

1163
01:50:45,548 --> 01:50:48,760
You make too many demands
on the royal ear.

1164
01:50:48,968 --> 01:50:54,307
The poor man can't concentrate for
more than an hour. You gave him four.

1165
01:50:59,604 --> 01:51:02,440
What did you think of it yourself?

1166
01:51:02,649 --> 01:51:05,151
Did you like it at all?

1167
01:51:06,736 --> 01:51:09,322
I thought it was marvelous.

1168
01:51:09,572 --> 01:51:13,243
Of course.
It's the best opera yet written.

1169
01:51:13,534 --> 01:51:15,119
I know it!

1170
01:51:17,997 --> 01:51:19,749
Why didn't they come?

1171
01:51:22,585 --> 01:51:26,297
I think you overestimate
our dear Viennese, friend.

1172
01:51:26,506 --> 01:51:30,009
You didn't give them a bang
at the end of songs...

1173
01:51:30,218 --> 01:51:32,679
...to let them know when to clap.

1174
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:35,891
I know, I know.

1175
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:39,561
Maybe you should give me
some lessons in that.

1176
01:51:40,604 --> 01:51:43,107
I wouldn't presume.

1177
01:51:46,235 --> 01:51:49,280
Nevertheless,
at the risk of imposing...

1178
01:51:49,488 --> 01:51:52,491
...I'd like you to see my new piece.

1179
01:51:53,784 --> 01:51:55,953
It would be an honor for me.

1180
01:51:56,161 --> 01:51:58,831
No, the honor would be all mine.

1181
01:53:25,003 --> 01:53:26,673
I believe...

1182
01:53:28,049 --> 01:53:29,842
I believe...

1183
01:53:30,051 --> 01:53:34,013
...it is the best opera
yet written, my friends.

1184
01:53:36,099 --> 01:53:37,725
Salieri!

1185
01:53:39,143 --> 01:53:43,189
You are the brightest star
in the musical firmament.

1186
01:53:43,398 --> 01:53:46,901
You do honor to Vienna and to me.

1187
01:54:13,511 --> 01:54:14,929
<i>Herr Mozart!</i>

1188
01:54:15,764 --> 01:54:18,976
- It was good of you to come.
- How could I not?

1189
01:54:19,184 --> 01:54:21,186
Bravo, maestro.

1190
01:54:22,313 --> 01:54:25,149
Did my work please you?

1191
01:54:26,567 --> 01:54:30,529
I never knew that music
like that was possible.

1192
01:54:31,739 --> 01:54:34,450
- You flatter me.
- No.

1193
01:54:35,367 --> 01:54:37,745
One hears such sounds...

1194
01:54:37,953 --> 01:54:41,373
...and what can one say but: Salieri!

1195
01:54:48,756 --> 01:54:54,346
Everybody's here and we've got guests.
Bravo! Well, I've got some more.

1196
01:54:54,554 --> 01:54:58,308
You remember my good
friend Schikaneder. Come in.

1197
01:54:58,516 --> 01:54:59,809
Don't be shy.

1198
01:55:00,018 --> 01:55:04,230
- This is a very nice girl, and this...
- Wolfie?

1199
01:55:05,231 --> 01:55:07,275
Yes, my love?

1200
01:55:07,734 --> 01:55:11,322
- These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
- Salzburg?

1201
01:55:12,573 --> 01:55:15,409
We were just talking about Salzburg.

1202
01:55:17,745 --> 01:55:20,248
Your father is dead.

1203
01:55:42,687 --> 01:55:45,273
So rose the dreadful ghost...

1204
01:55:45,523 --> 01:55:49,860
...from his next and blackest opera.

1205
01:55:55,157 --> 01:55:59,537
<i>There on the stage,
stood the figure of a dead commander.</i>

1206
01:55:59,745 --> 01:56:01,330
I knew...

1207
01:56:01,539 --> 01:56:03,292
...only I understood...

1208
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:06,837
...that the horrifying apparition
was Leopold...

1209
01:56:07,045 --> 01:56:08,714
...raised from the dead!

1210
01:56:38,286 --> 01:56:42,290
Wolfgang had actually
summoned up his own father...

1211
01:56:42,498 --> 01:56:46,210
...to accuse his son
before all the world!

1212
01:56:47,545 --> 01:56:49,422
It was...

1213
01:56:49,631 --> 01:56:53,051
...terrifying and wonderful to watch.

1214
01:57:57,159 --> 01:57:58,661
And now...

1215
01:58:04,125 --> 01:58:07,253
...the madness began in me.

1216
01:58:09,505 --> 01:58:13,050
The madness of a man
splitting in half.

1217
01:58:16,554 --> 01:58:19,265
Through my influence, I saw to it...

1218
01:58:19,473 --> 01:58:23,352
<i>... Don Giovanni was played
only five times in Vienna.</i>

1219
01:58:23,561 --> 01:58:28,190
But, in secret,
I went to every one of those five.

1220
01:58:28,399 --> 01:58:33,321
<i>Worshiping sound
I alone seemed to hear.</i>

1221
01:59:19,994 --> 01:59:23,456
<i>And as I stood there,
understanding how...</i>

1222
01:59:23,665 --> 01:59:27,252
...that bitter old man was
still possessing his poor son...

1223
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:30,129
<i>... even from beyond the grave...</i>

1224
01:59:30,380 --> 01:59:32,257
<i>... I began to see a way...</i>

1225
01:59:32,507 --> 01:59:34,300
<i>... a terrible way...</i>

1226
01:59:34,509 --> 01:59:37,345
...I could finally triumph...

1227
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:39,473
...over God.

1228
02:02:49,543 --> 02:02:51,253
<i>Herr Mozart?</i>

1229
02:02:54,214 --> 02:02:57,343
I have come to commission
work from you.

1230
02:02:58,719 --> 02:03:03,098
- What work?
- A Mass for the dead.

1231
02:03:03,307 --> 02:03:05,267
What dead?

1232
02:03:05,684 --> 02:03:07,770
Who is dead?

1233
02:03:07,978 --> 02:03:12,650
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass
and never got one.

1234
02:03:12,858 --> 02:03:16,404
- Who are you?
- I am only a messenger.

1235
02:03:16,613 --> 02:03:18,823
Do you accept?

1236
02:03:19,115 --> 02:03:21,534
You will be well paid.

1237
02:03:29,084 --> 02:03:31,337
Do you accept?

1238
02:03:41,931 --> 02:03:43,391
Work fast.

1239
02:03:43,599 --> 02:03:46,352
And be sure tell no one what you do.

1240
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:49,063
You will see me again soon.

1241
02:04:25,517 --> 02:04:26,977
Wolfie?

1242
02:04:38,155 --> 02:04:40,991
My plan was so simple...

1243
02:04:42,034 --> 02:04:44,536
...that it terrified me.

1244
02:04:46,622 --> 02:04:50,584
First, I must get the death Mass,
and then...

1245
02:04:52,544 --> 02:04:55,589
...I must achieve his death.

1246
02:04:57,090 --> 02:04:58,760
What?

1247
02:04:59,552 --> 02:05:01,679
His funeral!

1248
02:05:02,513 --> 02:05:03,807
Imagine it!

1249
02:05:04,016 --> 02:05:07,102
The cathedral,
all Vienna sitting there.

1250
02:05:07,353 --> 02:05:12,691
His coffin.
Mozart's little coffin in the middle.

1251
02:05:13,359 --> 02:05:15,069
And then...

1252
02:05:15,736 --> 02:05:17,988
...in that silence...

1253
02:05:20,157 --> 02:05:22,117
...music.

1254
02:05:23,410 --> 02:05:25,704
A divine music...

1255
02:05:25,913 --> 02:05:28,832
...bursts out over them all.

1256
02:05:29,458 --> 02:05:33,170
A great Mass of death.

1257
02:05:34,463 --> 02:05:38,425
Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart.

1258
02:05:38,634 --> 02:05:42,888
Composed by his devoted friend...

1259
02:05:43,305 --> 02:05:46,058
...Antonio Salieri.

1260
02:05:47,017 --> 02:05:48,727
What sublimity!

1261
02:05:48,936 --> 02:05:51,522
What depth!

1262
02:05:51,730 --> 02:05:54,817
What passion in the music!

1263
02:05:55,526 --> 02:05:59,447
Salieri has been touched
by God at last...

1264
02:05:59,656 --> 02:06:02,284
...and God forced to listen!

1265
02:06:03,743 --> 02:06:07,289
Powerless to stop it!

1266
02:06:07,497 --> 02:06:10,959
I, for once, in the end,
laughing at him!

1267
02:06:18,383 --> 02:06:22,679
The only thing that worried me
was the actual killing.

1268
02:06:22,887 --> 02:06:25,266
How does one do that?

1269
02:06:26,017 --> 02:06:28,811
How does one kill a man?

1270
02:06:30,021 --> 02:06:32,023
It's one thing...

1271
02:06:32,231 --> 02:06:34,609
...to dream about it.

1272
02:06:34,817 --> 02:06:38,070
Very different when you...

1273
02:06:40,406 --> 02:06:42,783
When you have to do it...

1274
02:06:45,369 --> 02:06:47,788
...with your own hands.

1275
02:06:57,299 --> 02:07:00,093
Come in!

1276
02:07:15,609 --> 02:07:20,197
<i>I've come to dinner</i>

1277
02:07:20,405 --> 02:07:23,200
Dinner! Are you mad?
I'm a nobleman!

1278
02:07:23,408 --> 02:07:26,870
I only ever dine
with people of my own height!

1279
02:07:27,079 --> 02:07:28,830
Stop it!

1280
02:07:29,539 --> 02:07:31,625
<i>Be careful
Be careful</i>

1281
02:07:31,875 --> 02:07:34,753
<i>Hold tight</i>

1282
02:07:35,253 --> 02:07:37,506
<i>I'm a famous...</i>

1283
02:07:37,714 --> 02:07:40,509
<i>... horseman</i>

1284
02:07:40,717 --> 02:07:45,014
<i>And we're a famous horsy</i>

1285
02:07:47,058 --> 02:07:51,021
<i>Give me a hoof, my darling</i>

1286
02:07:51,230 --> 02:07:56,402
<i>And I'll give you my heart</i>

1287
02:07:56,610 --> 02:08:01,115
<i>Take me to your stable</i>

1288
02:08:01,323 --> 02:08:04,618
<i>And never more we'll part</i>

1289
02:08:11,709 --> 02:08:14,753
<i>Kill me
Kill me</i>

1290
02:08:36,066 --> 02:08:40,905
<i>We're going to make a soprano stew</i>

1291
02:08:41,114 --> 02:08:45,785
<i>We're going to make a soprano stew</i>

1292
02:08:45,994 --> 02:08:49,748
<i>And when you make a soprano stew</i>

1293
02:08:49,956 --> 02:08:51,833
Shut up!

1294
02:08:52,042 --> 02:08:54,753
I'm sick to death of that tune!

1295
02:09:13,688 --> 02:09:17,276
<i>Give me some hay, my darling</i>

1296
02:09:17,526 --> 02:09:21,072
<i>And I'll give you my heart</i>

1297
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:23,491
Leporello! Some hay!

1298
02:10:14,376 --> 02:10:16,461
<i>We hope...</i>

1299
02:10:16,670 --> 02:10:20,882
<i>... you're contented</i>

1300
02:10:22,134 --> 02:10:24,761
<i>With what...</i>

1301
02:10:24,970 --> 02:10:29,142
<i>... we've presented</i>

1302
02:10:29,976 --> 02:10:36,649
<i>And love our dove of peace</i>

1303
02:11:01,842 --> 02:11:04,553
- What did you think?
- It was wonderful!

1304
02:11:04,803 --> 02:11:09,016
- He liked the little people.
- It's all in good fun.

1305
02:11:10,184 --> 02:11:12,436
I liked the horse.

1306
02:11:23,365 --> 02:11:26,993
<i>I tell you, if you played
Don Giovanni here...</i>

1307
02:11:27,452 --> 02:11:30,413
...you would've had
a wonderful success.

1308
02:11:30,622 --> 02:11:32,374
You belong here.

1309
02:11:32,582 --> 02:11:36,795
Not at the snobby court.
You could do anything you like.

1310
02:11:37,003 --> 02:11:41,800
The more fantastic, the better.
That's what people want: Fantasy.

1311
02:11:42,008 --> 02:11:45,220
You write a proper part for me...

1312
02:11:45,428 --> 02:11:47,722
...a couple of catchy songs...

1313
02:11:47,931 --> 02:11:52,310
...I guarantee you a triumph deluxe!

1314
02:11:52,936 --> 02:11:57,065
- What do you say?
- How much will you pay him?

1315
02:11:58,984 --> 02:12:02,570
Well! I see you brought
your manager with you.

1316
02:12:04,447 --> 02:12:06,574
Well, madame...

1317
02:12:06,783 --> 02:12:09,954
...how about half the receipts?

1318
02:12:10,371 --> 02:12:11,956
Half the receipts!

1319
02:12:12,164 --> 02:12:14,500
- Stanzi!
- I'm talking about now.

1320
02:12:14,710 --> 02:12:18,171
How much will you pay him now?
Down payment.

1321
02:12:18,380 --> 02:12:20,382
Down payment?

1322
02:12:21,466 --> 02:12:25,012
Who do you think I am, the emperor?

1323
02:12:25,929 --> 02:12:27,514
I have to go.

1324
02:12:27,723 --> 02:12:30,851
Stay here, you'll enjoy this next one.

1325
02:12:32,394 --> 02:12:33,770
You won't do this.

1326
02:12:33,979 --> 02:12:36,356
- Why not? Half the house!
- When?

1327
02:12:36,565 --> 02:12:40,611
We need money now! He pays
you now, or you don't do it.

1328
02:12:40,819 --> 02:12:42,446
I don't trust that man.

1329
02:12:42,654 --> 02:12:46,283
I don't like what he did
with your opera. It was common.

1330
02:12:46,491 --> 02:12:49,494
You liked it. Monkey, punky, flunky!

1331
02:12:49,703 --> 02:12:51,246
Half the house.

1332
02:12:51,455 --> 02:12:55,542
You'll never see a penny.
I want it here in my hand.

1333
02:12:55,751 --> 02:12:59,421
- I'll put it here in your hand.
- Shut up!

1334
02:12:59,630 --> 02:13:03,592
You won't put a thing in my hand
until I see some money!

1335
02:13:04,843 --> 02:13:09,432
It's embarrassing. Can't you think of
anyone who can do something for him?

1336
02:13:10,099 --> 02:13:14,020
I'm afraid Mozart
is a lost cause, baron.

1337
02:13:14,604 --> 02:13:18,858
He has succeeded in alienating
practically the whole of Vienna.

1338
02:13:19,067 --> 02:13:20,944
He never pays his debts.

1339
02:13:21,152 --> 02:13:25,198
<i>I can 't think of anyone
to whom I'd dare recommend him.</i>

1340
02:13:25,406 --> 02:13:29,661
<i>Herr Mozart. What a surprise!</i>

1341
02:13:30,787 --> 02:13:33,081
What can I do for you?

1342
02:13:34,415 --> 02:13:38,921
Is my pupil still interested
in learning the art of music?

1343
02:13:40,464 --> 02:13:45,302
Your pupil is married
and living in Mannheim, young man.

1344
02:13:45,886 --> 02:13:47,596
Really?

1345
02:13:53,102 --> 02:13:58,732
Perhaps your dear wife might care
to profit from my instruction.

1346
02:13:59,191 --> 02:14:01,485
What is it, Mozart?

1347
02:14:01,694 --> 02:14:04,364
What's the matter with you?

1348
02:14:04,572 --> 02:14:06,116
Well...

1349
02:14:06,324 --> 02:14:11,162
...since it appears no one
is eager to hire my services...

1350
02:14:11,371 --> 02:14:15,125
...could you favor me
with a little money instead?

1351
02:14:18,169 --> 02:14:19,587
What for?

1352
02:14:21,172 --> 02:14:25,343
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.

1353
02:14:28,722 --> 02:14:31,808
That's hardly the way to go about it.

1354
02:14:32,726 --> 02:14:36,104
You are right, sir. You are right.

1355
02:14:36,313 --> 02:14:40,775
But you see, I am endowed
with talent, and you with money.

1356
02:14:40,984 --> 02:14:42,902
If I offer mine...

1357
02:14:43,111 --> 02:14:45,780
...you should offer yours.

1358
02:14:48,950 --> 02:14:51,119
I'm sorry, no.

1359
02:14:53,913 --> 02:14:55,582
Please.

1360
02:14:57,460 --> 02:15:00,046
My answer is no, Mozart.

1361
02:15:06,261 --> 02:15:08,138
Please.

1362
02:15:12,392 --> 02:15:14,561
Please!

1363
02:15:51,432 --> 02:15:53,559
Don't answer it.

1364
02:15:55,436 --> 02:15:57,105
Why?

1365
02:15:59,315 --> 02:16:01,067
Tell him...

1366
02:16:02,151 --> 02:16:04,362
Tell him I'm not here.

1367
02:16:04,779 --> 02:16:06,698
Tell him...

1368
02:16:07,699 --> 02:16:10,243
Tell him I'm working on it.

1369
02:16:11,244 --> 02:16:13,371
Come back later.

1370
02:16:29,513 --> 02:16:32,474
- Am I interrupting something?
- No.

1371
02:16:32,725 --> 02:16:35,561
Good. Where's our friend?

1372
02:16:35,769 --> 02:16:37,771
He's not here.

1373
02:16:38,272 --> 02:16:41,734
But he's working on it,
he told me to tell you.

1374
02:16:42,693 --> 02:16:44,654
Is that it?

1375
02:16:50,493 --> 02:16:52,996
Is he happy with it?

1376
02:16:55,999 --> 02:16:59,002
What's this? A Requiem Mass?

1377
02:16:59,210 --> 02:17:03,423
- You think I'm in the funeral business?
- Leave that alone!

1378
02:17:03,632 --> 02:17:08,011
- Put it down! It's nothing for you!
- I'm sorry.

1379
02:17:08,386 --> 02:17:10,388
What have you got for me?

1380
02:17:11,389 --> 02:17:13,016
Finished?

1381
02:17:14,392 --> 02:17:19,064
- What?
- The vaudeville, what do you think?

1382
02:17:19,606 --> 02:17:21,149
Yes.

1383
02:17:21,524 --> 02:17:23,693
- Can I see it?
- No.

1384
02:17:25,153 --> 02:17:26,905
Why not?

1385
02:17:27,113 --> 02:17:29,741
Because there's nothing to see.

1386
02:17:38,083 --> 02:17:39,627
Look...

1387
02:17:40,586 --> 02:17:46,592
...I asked you if we could start
rehearsals next week and you said yes.

1388
02:17:47,885 --> 02:17:52,223
- Well, we can.
- So let me see it. Where is it?

1389
02:17:53,057 --> 02:17:54,726
Here.

1390
02:17:55,644 --> 02:18:01,191
It's all right here in my noodle.
The rest is just scribbling.

1391
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:05,153
Scribbling and bibbling.
Bibbling and scribbling.

1392
02:18:08,156 --> 02:18:10,701
- Like a drink?
- Look, you little cunt!

1393
02:18:10,909 --> 02:18:13,578
Do you know how many
people I've hired?

1394
02:18:13,787 --> 02:18:16,248
- Leave him alone!
- I'm paying them!

1395
02:18:16,498 --> 02:18:20,794
- He's doing his best.
- Paying them to wait. It's ridiculous!

1396
02:18:21,003 --> 02:18:24,506
You know what's ridiculous?
Your libretto!

1397
02:18:24,715 --> 02:18:27,884
Only an idiot would ask him
to work on that!

1398
02:18:28,093 --> 02:18:30,637
Twelve-foot snakes, magic flutes?

1399
02:18:30,846 --> 02:18:33,725
What's so intelligent about a Requiem?

1400
02:18:33,933 --> 02:18:36,853
Money. Money.

1401
02:18:39,772 --> 02:18:41,566
You're mad.

1402
02:18:42,191 --> 02:18:43,651
She's mad.

1403
02:18:44,068 --> 02:18:48,239
- Oh, yes?
- Wolfie, write it down.

1404
02:18:48,448 --> 02:18:50,366
Just write it down.

1405
02:18:50,575 --> 02:18:52,660
On paper.

1406
02:18:52,869 --> 02:18:56,039
It's no use to anybody in your head.

1407
02:18:56,247 --> 02:19:00,126
To hell with your death Mass!

1408
02:19:00,793 --> 02:19:03,588
Calm yourself.
What's the matter with you?

1409
02:19:03,796 --> 02:19:07,133
- I won't work there anymore.
- What happened?

1410
02:19:08,343 --> 02:19:11,387
You don't know what it's like.

1411
02:19:11,596 --> 02:19:14,641
<i>Herr Mozart frightens me.</i>

1412
02:19:14,849 --> 02:19:16,643
He drinks all day...

1413
02:19:16,851 --> 02:19:20,563
...then takes all that medicine
and it makes him worse.

1414
02:19:20,772 --> 02:19:22,232
Is he working?

1415
02:19:24,026 --> 02:19:27,155
Oh, I am frightened, sir, really!

1416
02:19:27,364 --> 02:19:32,243
- When he speaks, he makes no sense.
- Is he working?

1417
02:19:34,162 --> 02:19:36,414
I suppose so.

1418
02:19:36,957 --> 02:19:41,628
He sits there all the time,
doing some silly opera.

1419
02:19:41,836 --> 02:19:45,006
- Opera?
- Don't ask me to go back again.

1420
02:19:45,215 --> 02:19:48,468
I'm frightened.
I'm very, very frightened!

1421
02:19:48,677 --> 02:19:51,846
Are you sure it's an opera?

1422
02:21:35,411 --> 02:21:37,997
I don't have it yet.

1423
02:21:38,539 --> 02:21:41,668
Are you neglecting my request?

1424
02:21:42,335 --> 02:21:45,463
No. No, I...

1425
02:21:46,297 --> 02:21:48,591
I promise you...

1426
02:21:48,800 --> 02:21:52,804
...I'll give you a wonderful piece,
the best I ever...

1427
02:21:56,557 --> 02:21:59,894
This is my wife, Stanzi.

1428
02:22:00,436 --> 02:22:04,065
I've been sick,
but I'm all right now, aren't I?

1429
02:22:04,273 --> 02:22:06,359
Yes, sir. He's all right.

1430
02:22:06,567 --> 02:22:09,697
And he's working on it very hard.

1431
02:22:10,906 --> 02:22:14,577
Give me two more weeks. Please.

1432
02:22:14,786 --> 02:22:19,082
The sooner you finish,
the greater your reward.

1433
02:22:19,332 --> 02:22:21,376
Work.

1434
02:22:30,260 --> 02:22:31,803
Wolfie.

1435
02:22:34,097 --> 02:22:37,225
I think you really are going mad.

1436
02:22:38,768 --> 02:22:43,356
You slave for that idiot actor
who won't give you a penny!

1437
02:22:43,565 --> 02:22:46,359
And here,
this is not a ghost!

1438
02:22:46,568 --> 02:22:50,572
This is a real man,
who puts down real money.

1439
02:22:52,574 --> 02:22:55,619
Why on earth won't you finish it?

1440
02:22:56,536 --> 02:23:00,373
Can you give me one reason
I can understand?

1441
02:23:02,418 --> 02:23:04,545
It's killing me.

1442
02:23:08,466 --> 02:23:10,760
You're drunk, aren't you?

1443
02:23:10,968 --> 02:23:14,013
Be honest, tell me.
You've been drinking.

1444
02:23:16,807 --> 02:23:21,562
It's not fair.
I worry about you all the time.

1445
02:23:22,021 --> 02:23:25,399
I do everything I can to help you.

1446
02:23:25,608 --> 02:23:29,987
And all you do is drink
and talk nonsense, and frighten me.

1447
02:23:30,196 --> 02:23:32,698
Go back to bed!

1448
02:23:41,959 --> 02:23:43,543
Please.

1449
02:23:44,670 --> 02:23:48,548
Let me...
Let me sit here.

1450
02:23:51,551 --> 02:23:53,637
Let me stay here with you.

1451
02:26:27,253 --> 02:26:30,047
I did it.
And I was proud to do it.

1452
02:26:30,256 --> 02:26:34,219
"Leave! " I said. "Right away.
Take the child with you!

1453
02:26:34,428 --> 02:26:38,933
Go to the spa and get
your health back. " I was shocked.

1454
02:26:39,142 --> 02:26:41,936
Shocked to my foundation
when I saw her.

1455
02:26:42,145 --> 02:26:45,481
I couldn't believe my eyes,
poor little thing.

1456
02:26:45,690 --> 02:26:49,152
You monster!
No one exists but you, do they?

1457
02:26:49,360 --> 02:26:52,030
You and your music. I warned her.

1458
02:26:52,238 --> 02:26:55,074
"Choose a man, not a baby," I said.

1459
02:26:55,283 --> 02:27:00,455
"You marry him, you won't have a pot
to piss in. " You selfish thing!

1460
02:27:00,663 --> 02:27:05,627
Selfish, that's what you are.
Simply selfish! Do you hear me?

1461
02:30:48,689 --> 02:30:49,982
Pick him up.

1462
02:30:50,190 --> 02:30:51,900
Pick him up!

1463
02:30:53,903 --> 02:30:56,364
Be careful. Come with me.

1464
02:30:56,573 --> 02:30:58,366
You, follow me.

1465
02:31:25,978 --> 02:31:29,649
- Is it over?
- Yes, it's over. It's over.

1466
02:31:31,108 --> 02:31:32,568
Go!

1467
02:32:14,444 --> 02:32:16,154
Go, go. Go.

1468
02:32:17,197 --> 02:32:19,075
Go! Go!

1469
02:32:47,979 --> 02:32:49,939
Where is your wife?

1470
02:32:53,109 --> 02:32:55,570
Where is your wife?

1471
02:32:57,906 --> 02:33:02,036
She's not well either.
She went to the spa.

1472
02:33:03,454 --> 02:33:05,789
You are so good to me.

1473
02:33:06,290 --> 02:33:09,335
Truly. Thank you.

1474
02:33:09,793 --> 02:33:11,629
Please!

1475
02:33:12,338 --> 02:33:16,383
No, I mean to come to my opera.

1476
02:33:16,592 --> 02:33:21,597
You. You are the only colleague
of mine who came.

1477
02:33:24,558 --> 02:33:26,435
Mozart.

1478
02:33:27,561 --> 02:33:31,315
I would never miss anything
you had written.

1479
02:33:31,857 --> 02:33:35,277
- It's just a vaudeville.
- No, no!

1480
02:33:35,486 --> 02:33:37,446
It's a sublime piece.

1481
02:33:38,697 --> 02:33:40,824
<i>The grandest operone!</i>

1482
02:33:49,960 --> 02:33:51,712
I tell you...

1483
02:33:52,213 --> 02:33:56,175
...you are the greatest composer
known to me.

1484
02:34:00,221 --> 02:34:01,514
Do you mean it?

1485
02:34:07,561 --> 02:34:09,397
- It's him!
- Who?

1486
02:34:10,022 --> 02:34:11,691
The man.

1487
02:34:12,191 --> 02:34:13,985
He's here.

1488
02:34:17,029 --> 02:34:19,073
Tell him to go away.

1489
02:34:19,281 --> 02:34:23,577
Tell him I'm still working on it.
Don't let him in.

1490
02:34:24,412 --> 02:34:26,664
No, no. Wait!

1491
02:34:26,872 --> 02:34:30,876
Ask him if he would
give me some money now.

1492
02:34:31,085 --> 02:34:34,630
Tell him if he would,
it will help me to finish it.

1493
02:34:53,567 --> 02:34:55,902
- Salieri?
- Yes.

1494
02:34:57,779 --> 02:35:01,700
- Can we come in?
- Better not. He's sleeping.

1495
02:35:02,492 --> 02:35:06,413
- He's all right, though?
- Yes, he's just exhausted.

1496
02:35:06,621 --> 02:35:09,750
He became dizzy, that's all.

1497
02:35:09,958 --> 02:35:14,464
- Well, tell him we came by, won't you?
- Of course.

1498
02:35:14,922 --> 02:35:18,092
Give him this. That's his share.

1499
02:35:18,968 --> 02:35:21,679
- That should cheer him up.
- Indeed!

1500
02:35:21,888 --> 02:35:25,308
And now, good night to you all.
It was...

1501
02:35:25,516 --> 02:35:27,435
...perfection, truly.

1502
02:35:27,644 --> 02:35:29,103
Thank you.

1503
02:35:39,698 --> 02:35:41,533
What happened?

1504
02:35:49,958 --> 02:35:52,628
He said to give you this.

1505
02:35:53,504 --> 02:35:56,799
And if you finish by tomorrow night...

1506
02:35:57,716 --> 02:36:00,761
...he will pay you
another hundred ducats.

1507
02:36:01,387 --> 02:36:02,888
Another...?

1508
02:36:03,764 --> 02:36:06,809
That's too soon. Tomorrow night...

1509
02:36:08,560 --> 02:36:10,521
It's impossible.

1510
02:36:13,857 --> 02:36:16,944
- Did he say a hundred?
- Yes.

1511
02:36:22,533 --> 02:36:24,493
It's too soon.

1512
02:36:26,745 --> 02:36:28,497
Can I...?

1513
02:36:28,914 --> 02:36:30,958
Could I help you?

1514
02:36:33,545 --> 02:36:35,380
Would you?

1515
02:36:39,135 --> 02:36:40,594
Actually, you could.

1516
02:36:48,227 --> 02:36:50,813
- I want to go.
- Where?

1517
02:36:51,105 --> 02:36:54,358
- I want to go back to Vienna.
- Now?

1518
02:36:54,567 --> 02:36:56,152
- Yes.
- Why?

1519
02:36:58,571 --> 02:37:00,323
I feel wrong.

1520
02:37:01,866 --> 02:37:04,368
I feel wrong being here.

1521
02:37:07,246 --> 02:37:10,875
<i>- Where did I stop?
- The end of the Recordare.</i>

1522
02:37:11,083 --> 02:37:12,710
<i>So now Confutatis...</i>

1523
02:37:19,592 --> 02:37:21,969
How would you translate that?

1524
02:37:22,178 --> 02:37:25,014
"Consigned to flames of woe."

1525
02:37:27,184 --> 02:37:29,895
- Do you believe in it?
- What?

1526
02:37:31,146 --> 02:37:35,233
A fire which never dies,
burning you forever.

1527
02:37:36,568 --> 02:37:37,819
Oh, yes.

1528
02:37:39,529 --> 02:37:41,156
Possible.

1529
02:37:42,866 --> 02:37:46,703
- Come, let's begin.
- We ended in F major.

1530
02:37:46,912 --> 02:37:50,248
- Yes.
- So, now, A minor.

1531
02:37:58,048 --> 02:38:01,093
- A minor.
- Yes.

1532
02:38:03,930 --> 02:38:06,933
<i>Confutatis. A minor.</i>

1533
02:38:09,227 --> 02:38:11,145
Start with the voices.

1534
02:38:11,354 --> 02:38:14,649
- Basses first. Second beat of the...
- Time?

1535
02:38:14,857 --> 02:38:18,444
Common time.
Second beat of the first measure.

1536
02:38:19,821 --> 02:38:21,782
On A.

1537
02:38:23,659 --> 02:38:25,911
Second measure, second beat.

1538
02:38:26,662 --> 02:38:27,913
You see?

1539
02:38:28,122 --> 02:38:29,915
- Yes. G-sharp?
- Of course.

1540
02:38:30,124 --> 02:38:33,419
Second beat
of the third measure, on E.

1541
02:38:40,384 --> 02:38:42,720
Do you have me? Show me.

1542
02:39:02,489 --> 02:39:05,075
Good. Good.

1543
02:39:05,284 --> 02:39:06,869
Now the tenors.

1544
02:39:07,077 --> 02:39:10,331
Fourth beat
of the first measure, on C.

1545
02:39:12,416 --> 02:39:15,837
Second measure, fourth beat. D.

1546
02:39:18,131 --> 02:39:20,425
- All right?
- Yes, continue.

1547
02:39:20,634 --> 02:39:23,887
Second beat
of the fourth measure, on F.

1548
02:39:30,686 --> 02:39:34,690
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon,
bass trombones, basses.

1549
02:39:34,899 --> 02:39:37,443
Identical notes and rhythm.

1550
02:39:40,529 --> 02:39:44,742
First bassoon, tenor trombones,
with the tenors.

1551
02:39:49,664 --> 02:39:53,417
- You go too fast.
- Do you have it?

1552
02:39:53,626 --> 02:39:56,837
- Bassoon to trombone what?
- With the tenors.

1553
02:39:57,046 --> 02:40:00,466
- Identical?
- The instruments doubling the voices.

1554
02:40:00,675 --> 02:40:04,345
Trumpets and timpani.
Trumpets in D. Listen.

1555
02:40:04,553 --> 02:40:07,014
- I don't understand!
- Listen!

1556
02:40:07,223 --> 02:40:11,645
Trumpets in D, tonic and dominant,
first and third beats.

1557
02:40:12,688 --> 02:40:14,690
It goes with the harmony!

1558
02:40:21,154 --> 02:40:23,532
Yes. Yes, yes!

1559
02:40:32,666 --> 02:40:35,043
I understand. And that's all?

1560
02:40:35,252 --> 02:40:38,630
No, now for the real fire.
Strings in unison.

1561
02:40:38,839 --> 02:40:41,591
Ostinato, on A. Like this:

1562
02:40:44,386 --> 02:40:46,388
Next measure is rising.

1563
02:40:48,223 --> 02:40:50,559
Do you have it? Show me.

1564
02:40:58,192 --> 02:41:01,279
- It's wonderful!
- Yes, yes. Go on.

1565
02:41:08,037 --> 02:41:09,997
- Write that down!
- Yes, yes.

1566
02:41:14,209 --> 02:41:16,920
"Call me among the blessed."

1567
02:41:17,338 --> 02:41:18,964
C major.

1568
02:41:19,173 --> 02:41:23,844
Sopranos and altos in thirds.
Altos on C, sopranos above.

1569
02:41:36,565 --> 02:41:39,360
<i>Sopranos up to F on the second voca?</i>

1570
02:41:39,568 --> 02:41:45,240
<i>And on dictus. And underneath,
just violins. Arpeggios.</i>

1571
02:41:45,783 --> 02:41:49,161
Scale in eighth notes,
then back to ostinato.

1572
02:41:49,370 --> 02:41:51,538
- Do you have it?
- You go too fast.

1573
02:41:51,747 --> 02:41:55,000
- Do you have it?
- One moment, please!

1574
02:41:58,963 --> 02:42:02,801
Good. Show me the whole thing
from the beginning.

1575
02:44:06,095 --> 02:44:08,555
Do you want to rest a bit?

1576
02:44:08,931 --> 02:44:11,100
No, I'm not tired at all.

1577
02:44:16,981 --> 02:44:19,733
We'll stop for a moment.

1578
02:44:19,942 --> 02:44:25,030
<i>- Then we'll finish the Lacrimosa.
- I can keep going. I assure you.</i>

1579
02:44:25,239 --> 02:44:28,784
Will you stay with me
while I sleep a little?

1580
02:44:30,285 --> 02:44:32,538
I'm not leaving you.

1581
02:44:40,005 --> 02:44:42,340
I'm so ashamed.

1582
02:44:43,633 --> 02:44:45,677
Of what?

1583
02:44:46,177 --> 02:44:48,596
I was foolish.

1584
02:44:48,805 --> 02:44:53,393
I thought you did not care
for my work, or me.

1585
02:44:57,063 --> 02:44:59,024
Forgive me.

1586
02:45:03,611 --> 02:45:05,697
Forgive me.

1587
02:46:03,507 --> 02:46:05,967
What are you doing here?

1588
02:46:08,178 --> 02:46:11,390
Your husband took sick.

1589
02:46:12,516 --> 02:46:14,518
I brought him home.

1590
02:46:16,269 --> 02:46:18,063
Why you?

1591
02:46:19,189 --> 02:46:22,442
Because, madame, I was at hand.

1592
02:46:26,239 --> 02:46:29,534
Well, thank you very much.
You can go now.

1593
02:46:32,036 --> 02:46:34,122
He needs me, ma'am.

1594
02:46:34,414 --> 02:46:36,290
No, he doesn't.

1595
02:46:36,499 --> 02:46:40,586
And I don't want you here.
Just go, please.

1596
02:46:41,295 --> 02:46:44,258
- He asked me to stay.
- And I'm ask...

1597
02:47:14,330 --> 02:47:16,332
I'm back.

1598
02:47:19,501 --> 02:47:22,380
I missed you so much.

1599
02:47:26,134 --> 02:47:28,011
If you'd just...

1600
02:47:29,387 --> 02:47:32,390
...show me that you need me.

1601
02:47:38,313 --> 02:47:41,566
And I'll try to do better too.

1602
02:47:53,328 --> 02:47:55,121
What is this?

1603
02:47:58,333 --> 02:48:02,712
No, Wolfie, not this. Not this.

1604
02:48:06,383 --> 02:48:10,137
You're not to work on this ever again.

1605
02:48:11,222 --> 02:48:13,057
I've decided.

1606
02:48:16,853 --> 02:48:19,523
This is not his handwriting.

1607
02:48:21,274 --> 02:48:23,068
It's mine.

1608
02:48:24,069 --> 02:48:26,405
I was assisting him.

1609
02:48:27,364 --> 02:48:30,492
He's not to work on this anymore.

1610
02:48:30,701 --> 02:48:32,911
- It's making him ill.
- But...

1611
02:48:35,706 --> 02:48:37,874
Good night.

1612
02:48:40,377 --> 02:48:44,965
<i>I regret we have no servants
to show you out, Herr Salieri.</i>

1613
02:48:45,173 --> 02:48:48,093
Please respect my wish and go.

1614
02:48:48,343 --> 02:48:50,137
Madame...

1615
02:48:50,345 --> 02:48:52,889
...I will respect his.

1616
02:52:57,350 --> 02:53:00,186
Your merciful God.

1617
02:53:03,481 --> 02:53:08,778
He destroyed his own beloved,
rather than let a mediocrity...

1618
02:53:08,987 --> 02:53:12,949
...share in the smallest part
of his glory.

1619
02:53:14,409 --> 02:53:16,036
He killed Mozart.

1620
02:53:17,037 --> 02:53:19,789
And kept me alive to torture.

1621
02:53:19,998 --> 02:53:22,167
Thirty-two years of torture.

1622
02:53:22,375 --> 02:53:28,048
Thirty-two years of slowly
watching myself become extinct.

1623
02:53:28,256 --> 02:53:30,508
My music...

1624
02:53:30,717 --> 02:53:32,635
...growing fainter.

1625
02:53:32,844 --> 02:53:35,680
All the time fainter...

1626
02:53:35,889 --> 02:53:38,809
...till no one plays it at all.

1627
02:53:39,769 --> 02:53:41,020
And his...

1628
02:53:42,938 --> 02:53:47,568
Good morning, professor.
Time for the water closet.

1629
02:53:47,902 --> 02:53:52,823
Then we have your favorite breakfast.
Sugar rolls. He loves those.

1630
02:53:53,407 --> 02:53:56,078
Fresh sugar rolls.

1631
02:53:56,286 --> 02:53:58,789
I will speak for you, Father.

1632
02:53:58,997 --> 02:54:02,167
I speak for all mediocrities
in the world.

1633
02:54:02,626 --> 02:54:05,379
I am their champion.

1634
02:54:05,587 --> 02:54:08,298
I am their patron saint.

1635
02:54:18,684 --> 02:54:21,561
Mediocrities everywhere...

1636
02:54:23,021 --> 02:54:25,524
...I absolve you.

1637
02:54:27,275 --> 02:54:28,860
I absolve you.

1638
02:54:30,195 --> 02:54:32,615
I absolve you.

1639
02:54:34,993 --> 02:54:37,620
I absolve you.

1640
02:54:38,329 --> 02:54:41,374
I absolve you all.
