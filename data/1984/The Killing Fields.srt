1
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:32,040
Cambodia.

2
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:36,008
To many Westerners,
it seemed a paradise.

3
00:00:36,214 --> 00:00:39,377
Another world, a secret world.

4
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:43,620
But the war in neighboring
Vietnam burst its borders...

5
00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:47,349
...and the fighting soon spread
to neutral Cambodia.

6
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:51,489
In 1973, I went to cover
this sideshow struggle...

7
00:00:51,695 --> 00:00:54,789
...as foreign correspondent
of The New York Times.

8
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,930
It was there, amidst the fighting...

9
00:00:58,135 --> 00:01:01,468
...between government troops
and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas...

10
00:01:01,672 --> 00:01:05,267
...that I met my guide
and interpreter, Dith Pran...

11
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:08,468
...a man who was to change my life...

12
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:11,648
...in a country that I grew to love
and pity.

13
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:23,656
So here we go
with Voice of America...

14
00:01:23,861 --> 00:01:25,852
...news for Southeast Asia.

15
00:01:26,063 --> 00:01:30,193
It's 6:45 and a partly cloudy
morning here.

16
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:32,664
Clouds too in Washington.

17
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:36,635
President Nixon announced he'll
address the nation on Watergate...

18
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,705
...within the next few days.

19
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:41,536
The speech will be Nixon's
first since May.

20
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,406
The scandal has caused resignations
and paralyzed the White House staff.

21
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:51,212
It has also led to intense
confrontation and perhaps...

22
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:54,288
...a constitutional crisis
with Senate investigators...

23
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:57,119
...and a special
Watergate prosecutor.

24
00:01:57,327 --> 00:02:00,694
The speech was announced
after the Gallup Poll disclosed...

25
00:02:00,897 --> 00:02:04,765
...that Mr. Nixon's popularity
had fallen to the lowest point...

26
00:02:04,968 --> 00:02:07,766
...for an American President
in 20 years.

27
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:22,345
A Supreme Court judge,
William O. Douglas...

28
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:25,520
...has ruled against an appeal
by the Administration...

29
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:27,382
...for a stay of the injunction...

30
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:31,081
...on further U.S. Bombing
missions in Cambodia.

31
00:02:31,293 --> 00:02:34,285
Congress has already ruled
these bombings illegal...

32
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:38,762
...and they should cease in one
week's time on August the 15th.

33
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,212
Let's go, Sarun!
To the hospital!

34
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:23,302
Information. Information.

35
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:28,448
Air Cambodia regret delays of arrival
of flight number 125...

36
00:03:28,649 --> 00:03:32,278
...from Bangkok because
of bad weather.

37
00:03:53,707 --> 00:03:55,834
Mister, you want taxi?

38
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:58,306
Mister, you want taxi?
Good taxi.

39
00:04:25,838 --> 00:04:28,898
Shut the fucking blinds, will you?

40
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:34,973
What's all this shit?

41
00:04:38,017 --> 00:04:39,416
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:43,586
I thought you were the houseboy.
I was developing some film.

43
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:47,650
If you're gonna yell, I'll come back.
I'm not feeling good.

44
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,294
Don't want to yell.
I want to be in a good mood.

45
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:53,431
The plane was late, no car.
I had to take a taxi here.

46
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:55,997
All I want to do is work.
I got you.

47
00:05:05,977 --> 00:05:08,309
What the fuck is that on your head?

48
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:14,307
It's a sanitary napkin.
I had it soaked in ice.

49
00:05:15,953 --> 00:05:18,615
Syd Schanberg.
Is Pran there?

50
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:22,618
No, I just came from the airport.

51
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:26,553
Well, if he comes in,
would you tell him I'm here?

52
00:05:26,898 --> 00:05:29,389
I'll be at the Café Central, tell him.

53
00:05:29,867 --> 00:05:30,856
Thanks a lot.

54
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:49,913
What do you want to eat?

55
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:52,886
Want some eggs?

56
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,617
I can't. Somebody told me they faint
with fright when you cook them.

57
00:05:56,827 --> 00:05:59,057
- What do you want to eat?
- What are you having?

58
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:00,820
I'm having a café complet.

59
00:06:01,465 --> 00:06:03,831
I'll have that. And some aspirin.

60
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:15,136
Anything I eat has got to be
absolutely dead.

61
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:17,244
That's why I can never eat an oyster.

62
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:20,782
I read somewhere that they put...

63
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:26,748
...that lemon juice on them
just to stun them. You know?

64
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:28,116
What's the difference?

65
00:06:29,592 --> 00:06:34,029
An unconscious oyster's just as
horrible as the fucker wide awake...

66
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:50,744
- My God! Look at this.
- Did you see that?

67
00:06:50,946 --> 00:06:52,277
What was it? A rocket?

68
00:06:52,481 --> 00:06:55,177
I don't know.
I saw a guy on a motorbike.

69
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:05,491
I've been looking for you.

70
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:07,251
I left a message for you.

71
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:09,487
I didn't get it. I took a cab.

72
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:12,632
- There is a big accident right now.
- What?

73
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:16,201
I think U.S. Drop many big bombs
on little city.

74
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:19,730
- U.S. Bombs? You're sure?
- I think many dead.

75
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:22,432
- Does anybody else know about it?
- Nothing at all.

76
00:07:23,411 --> 00:07:24,469
We're going.

77
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:27,237
Not possible right now, Sydney.
Too dangerous.

78
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,406
Where you going, Schanberg?

79
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,412
Neak Luong.

80
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:01,876
Neak Luong's closed.

81
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:05,848
Don't give me that, Reeves.
You got nothing to say about this.

82
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:09,545
I got a right to go wherever I like
in this sad little country.

83
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:14,659
That's the law. You impede me, you're
breaking the Cooper/Church Amendment!

84
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:17,728
Well, up the Cooper/Church
Amendment's ass!

85
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,459
Let's go!

86
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,504
So how can I help you, Mr. Schanberg?

87
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:43,454
I'm looking for information on why
my airplane was delayed this morning.

88
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,985
- Your plane was delayed?
- That's right.

89
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,492
I don't know. Maybe it's
bad weather. Your flight's...

90
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,755
You don't know anything about it?

91
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:54,557
No, I don't.

92
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,023
All right.

93
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,360
Then I'd like you
to listen to something...

94
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:02,597
...and then I'd like a comment.

95
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:06,671
This morning, for reasons beyond
anybody's control...

96
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:10,974
...I spend two hours in Bangkok
staring at a seat belt sign.

97
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:12,740
Meanwhile, my sources tell me...

98
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:16,751
...two Army helicopters are landing
here, just across the airfield.

99
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:20,587
Half the ambulances in Phnom Penh
are waiting there to meet them.

100
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:25,156
And now there's a rumor that
the U.S. Air Force dropped a bomb...

101
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:27,263
...or several bombs, on Neak Luong.

102
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:30,628
That's a rumor, and I'm not gonna
comment on a rumor.

103
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:34,896
I just want to know if that's the
reason why my airplane was delayed!

104
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:39,743
No comment.

105
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:41,871
How many killed?

106
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:46,246
How many wounded?

107
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:54,552
Thank you for your cooperation,
Major Reeves.

108
00:09:56,827 --> 00:10:01,059
When I scrape this story out, I will
no doubt be quoting you in full!

109
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,066
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:47,609
This is just not good enough.

111
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,801
This is a big story...

112
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:54,245
...a major story, you understand that?
We've got to get down there!

113
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,543
- I know, but...
- I don't want to hear "no"!

114
00:10:56,753 --> 00:10:58,744
I want to get down that river!

115
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:00,683
We should be down there now!

116
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:14,399
I'll be here.

117
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:18,462
Good night, Sydney.

118
00:11:27,582 --> 00:11:29,345
- Messages?
- No, sir.

119
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:30,874
No, sir.

120
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:36,152
I'd talk, but it's been
a heavy day and I've got to go.

121
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:38,826
Let's get together again soon, okay?

122
00:11:39,027 --> 00:11:40,391
- Bob?
- See you.

123
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:41,828
Bob?

124
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,921
Hello, Sydney. Good night, Sydney.

125
00:11:45,132 --> 00:11:48,329
- Listen, I can't talk with you.
- You can talk to me.

126
00:11:48,536 --> 00:11:51,505
The embassy is jittery.
Get information from a press officer.

127
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:54,003
Let's not start insulting each other.

128
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,937
Good night, Sydney.

129
00:11:58,846 --> 00:12:00,313
All right, good night.

130
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:07,651
You've heard of pilot error?

131
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:09,345
Computer malfunction?

132
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,690
They screwed up on the coordinates.

133
00:12:11,892 --> 00:12:15,658
A single B-52 dropped
its entire load on Neak Luong.

134
00:12:17,398 --> 00:12:20,094
There's a homing beacon
in the middle of the town.

135
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,692
- Casualties?
- You'll be briefed tomorrow.

136
00:12:23,903 --> 00:12:28,602
We estimate 55 military,
something like 35 civilians.

137
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:31,271
How many?

138
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,478
I hear it's in the hundreds.
Don't quote me on that.

139
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:39,948
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath

140
00:12:40,153 --> 00:12:43,247
When the Khmer Rouge hit the town?

141
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:46,419
Will there be a dreadful bloodbath...?

142
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:51,324
Beer! We haven't had this
for four weeks.

143
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:53,631
New York Times probably
had it flown in.

144
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:57,635
- They keep it in their suite.
- We got a cellar. Don't you know?

145
00:12:57,837 --> 00:13:00,305
Americans take themselves so seriously.

146
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:05,307
Don't be hard on the man. He's just
trying to get to the top of the heap.

147
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:09,106
We'll just have to pay more to get
our telexes to the top of the heap.

148
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:11,839
The man has just bought you a beer.
Now drink up.

149
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,108
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Syd.

150
00:13:13,318 --> 00:13:15,309
- Enjoy it.
- Off to see the telex operator?

151
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:17,921
- New York Times goes to bed early.
- Sure!

152
00:13:19,658 --> 00:13:22,422
Khmer Rouge in the sunset

153
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:26,263
The Yanks all at sea...

154
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:32,195
- All right?
- Very possible.

155
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:34,839
Let's go then!

156
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:44,337
This is good work.

157
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,543
- How much?
- Hundred fifty.

158
00:14:29,893 --> 00:14:30,882
One hundred!

159
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:38,400
- All right?
- All right.

160
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:47,938
Nice going, Pran.

161
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:49,363
- What is he saying?
- He wants you to look at his family.

162
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:54,007
To take a photograph and help him
because his child was wounded.

163
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:22,628
Tell me what she's saying.

164
00:16:24,938 --> 00:16:26,428
She needs help.

165
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:33,005
Her shop was destroyed last night.

166
00:16:34,214 --> 00:16:35,647
Her husband killed.

167
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:37,077
How many bombs?

168
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:40,281
She doesn't know.

169
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:43,413
Does she know where the hospital is?

170
00:16:45,192 --> 00:16:46,523
"Just over there."

171
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,063
She wants to know,
"Did someone arrest the pilot?"

172
00:16:57,704 --> 00:17:00,502
Mister, you wanna buy?
Mister, you wanna buy?

173
00:17:00,874 --> 00:17:04,105
- One dollar? You wanna buy?
- I'm out of film. I'm sorry.

174
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:08,246
Ask her how many kids she's got
in her family.

175
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:10,379
"Five."

176
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,284
Her husband was killed already.

177
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,852
What's this?

178
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:21,088
What are these guys over here?

179
00:17:26,432 --> 00:17:29,333
In the jeep, prisoners.
Khmer Rouge prisoners.

180
00:17:52,457 --> 00:17:54,448
They kill a lot of villagers.

181
00:17:54,826 --> 00:17:57,386
She says Khmer Rouge soak rags
in gasoline...

182
00:17:57,595 --> 00:17:59,620
...and push them down
villagers' throat...

183
00:17:59,831 --> 00:18:01,822
...then set the rags alight.

184
00:18:02,066 --> 00:18:03,226
Film! No film!

185
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:04,925
I know there's no film.

186
00:18:05,136 --> 00:18:06,262
No camera!

187
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:08,597
No camera!

188
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,134
It's all right.

189
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:14,544
Just take it easy.

190
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:22,076
Tell them we're jour...

191
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,161
Come on! Get in!

192
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,967
I'm worried.

193
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,809
I'm the guy who bring you over here.

194
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,809
They accuse me and they arrest me.

195
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,873
How can they arrest you?
You're already arrested.

196
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:32,377
They phone Phnom Penh about me.

197
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:43,221
I want some cigarettes.

198
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:46,868
And I need to take a leak.

199
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:52,029
Would you tell them I need to piss?

200
00:20:16,197 --> 00:20:17,687
He said, "No piss."

201
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:20,660
What does that mean?

202
00:20:21,202 --> 00:20:23,067
That's no piss.

203
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:29,805
I've had enough of this bullshit.

204
00:20:30,477 --> 00:20:32,468
I got a story to get to New York!

205
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:39,015
Don't leave me!

206
00:20:49,897 --> 00:20:51,159
I won't leave you.

207
00:21:59,998 --> 00:22:02,398
They brought in the whole press corps!

208
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:05,934
They want to sanitize the story!
Bastards!

209
00:22:16,381 --> 00:22:18,508
I am going to tell you something.

210
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,411
I'm walking out of here.

211
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,951
What are you gonna do?
Blow my head off?

212
00:22:23,221 --> 00:22:26,213
You got a general out there,
this is an American passport...

213
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:28,359
...and I am walking out of here!

214
00:22:31,128 --> 00:22:34,393
- He wants to get higher officer.
- Then get him! Get him!

215
00:22:42,807 --> 00:22:46,937
I'm sorry we couldn't show you the
minor bomb damage in the city itself.

216
00:22:47,144 --> 00:22:48,941
It's still a restricted area.

217
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:51,410
Now, if you look across the river...

218
00:22:51,615 --> 00:22:54,550
...you'll see positions held by
Khmer Rouge...

219
00:22:54,752 --> 00:22:56,549
...who moved in over
the past few days.

220
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:59,985
But the Cambodian Republican Army
is moving in on them.

221
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:03,683
They'll have the K.R. Out
before you can say "Jack Robinson."

222
00:23:04,595 --> 00:23:06,290
Get in the chopper now!

223
00:23:06,597 --> 00:23:10,055
No, Schanberg! You came on a boat,
you go back on a boat!

224
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:12,461
That won't stop my story!

225
00:23:15,205 --> 00:23:16,137
What is this?

226
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:19,365
If you weren't down here,
I wouldn't be down here.

227
00:23:19,576 --> 00:23:22,477
And I don't want to be down here!
What good is it doing?

228
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,510
If anybody ever reads about this...

229
00:23:24,714 --> 00:23:27,410
...you won't be able to look them
in the face!

230
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:08,783
Good morning.

231
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,614
What time is it?

232
00:24:12,594 --> 00:24:14,118
Six o'clock.

233
00:24:15,564 --> 00:24:16,462
Shit.

234
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:17,893
Telex for you.

235
00:24:18,534 --> 00:24:20,001
You been to the telex?

236
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:23,769
We made the front page.

237
00:24:23,972 --> 00:24:24,939
Sure.

238
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:29,101
We must be doing something right.

239
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:39,678
My wife is very worried.

240
00:24:40,321 --> 00:24:43,916
She thinks all foreign journalists
are going to leave Cambodia.

241
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:46,859
Well, Pran...

242
00:24:48,062 --> 00:24:52,465
...l'd feel kind of stupid trying to
cover this war from a desk in Bangkok.

243
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:56,995
And she said if the war
keeps going like this...

244
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:59,366
...the future could be very bad.

245
00:25:01,242 --> 00:25:02,539
What do you think?

246
00:25:05,613 --> 00:25:06,944
I don't know.

247
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,815
I don't know either.

248
00:25:13,587 --> 00:25:15,555
- Is Sarun downstairs?
- Sure.

249
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,189
Let's get going.

250
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:20,126
All right.

251
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,696
Don't go back to sleep.

252
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:28,993
I won't.

253
00:25:37,978 --> 00:25:40,208
K.R.'s making a push
for the airport road.

254
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,438
If they cut it,
the city could be lost.

255
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:46,085
We hype these people up. "You'll be
all right with us," we say.

256
00:25:46,286 --> 00:25:48,550
Now look at all this fucking mess!

257
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:58,992
In America, everybody got a good car.

258
00:26:01,233 --> 00:26:03,599
He ask you what car you drive
in United States.

259
00:26:03,802 --> 00:26:06,862
I don't have a car in America,
only the Mercedes here.

260
00:26:07,072 --> 00:26:09,267
Mercedes, number one!

261
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:12,333
Ask him where he learned
to speak his English.

262
00:26:15,314 --> 00:26:17,782
American advisor with his unit
teach him.

263
00:26:17,983 --> 00:26:20,042
Mercedes, number one, okay?

264
00:26:58,323 --> 00:26:59,381
What did he say?

265
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,616
He said he thought all
American people left already.

266
00:27:03,261 --> 00:27:05,195
Made in the USA.

267
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,724
Are we winning?

268
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:12,728
No, you're not winning.

269
00:27:12,937 --> 00:27:14,267
What should we do?

270
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:17,702
Well, you make sure they don't
cut off the airport road.

271
00:27:20,677 --> 00:27:23,009
The first section came
by Route number 36.

272
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,377
And the second one
came down by Route number 26.

273
00:27:27,584 --> 00:27:30,075
Khmer Rouge will come down Route 3.

274
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,953
He doesn't know how many.

275
00:27:32,155 --> 00:27:34,146
They expect an attack today.

276
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:35,848
- Where's your commander?
- Phnom Penh.

277
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,458
- Why there?
- Don't know.

278
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:39,595
How many mortar rounds you have...?

279
00:27:54,011 --> 00:27:57,605
Rockoff, get your ass out here!
Get out here!

280
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:02,513
Come on, let's get him out of here!

281
00:28:30,212 --> 00:28:31,543
- Fuck this!
- They pulling out?

282
00:28:31,747 --> 00:28:33,681
I'm not happy here, Syd.

283
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:35,782
Jon, I'm leaving.

284
00:28:36,051 --> 00:28:37,609
Syd, come on!

285
00:28:37,952 --> 00:28:38,941
Come on!

286
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,001
Sydney, this way!

287
00:29:15,323 --> 00:29:17,119
Sydney, look! Khmer Rouge!

288
00:30:06,706 --> 00:30:09,641
In Washington, the
Cambodian ambassador...

289
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:12,743
...in a speech to
the Washington Press Club said:

290
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:15,846
"Let's face it, you took
advantage of us."

291
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:16,946
I can't eat.

292
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:21,985
"You are cleverer than we are, and
you induced us into this fighting."

293
00:30:22,722 --> 00:30:25,782
Indeed, the Khmer Rouge
insurgents in Cambodia...

294
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:29,155
...have tightened their ring
around the capital, Phnom Penh...

295
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:32,957
...now swollen with some two million
refugees from the fighting.

296
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:37,397
Reports from government troops talk
of the field situation being so bad...

297
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:40,935
...that soldiers are having
to siphon gas from jeep to jeep...

298
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:45,098
...in order to be able to get
the wounded back to the capital.

299
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,127
No more electricity.

300
00:31:40,397 --> 00:31:43,025
And now I get a message
to try for negotiations.

301
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,202
Well, it's just too goddamn late!

302
00:31:45,402 --> 00:31:47,734
Alan, this country's split apart.

303
00:31:47,938 --> 00:31:51,738
We put this ship to sea, and it breaks
my heart not to help it back to port.

304
00:31:51,942 --> 00:31:53,034
Any port.

305
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:58,010
What pisses me off is, this country
has faults and strengths...

306
00:31:58,214 --> 00:32:01,775
...and we have done nothing
but play to the faults.

307
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:07,479
I tell you, I will be damn
glad to get out of here.

308
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:12,423
This thing has dragged on too long for
it to end in all sweetness and light.

309
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:14,893
After what the Khmer Rouge
have been through...

310
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:18,067
...they won't be exactly
affectionate toward Westerners.

311
00:32:20,203 --> 00:32:23,138
- Where do you want this?
- On the floor. Anywhere.

312
00:32:23,339 --> 00:32:26,934
- Mr. Schanberg...
- Oh, Christ, my dependents! Six.

313
00:32:27,143 --> 00:32:28,405
Dith Pran and family.

314
00:32:28,611 --> 00:32:29,635
Right.

315
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,815
"Dear sir, my family and I are planning
a touring vacation of Southeast Asia...

316
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:40,751
...and anticipate two weeks
in Cambodia touring the country.

317
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,723
Would you please send tour
information and brochures?

318
00:32:44,926 --> 00:32:47,224
Thanking you in advance,
Wendell Payne."

319
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:50,330
Wendell lives in Wisacky,
South Carolina.

320
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,660
What about the airlift?

321
00:32:52,868 --> 00:32:54,426
We're taking it with us.

322
00:32:55,304 --> 00:32:58,637
- People will starve to death.
- I know, but what can we do?

323
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,206
Look, there could be a bloodbath here.

324
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:06,277
Excuse the pun, but we're
either staying or we're living.

325
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,216
Hello, leaving a sinking ship then,
are we, Carver?

326
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,669
President Ford, in his foreign policy
speech, hardly referred to Cambodia...

327
00:33:30,871 --> 00:33:34,807
...except to say that, as of now,
it may be too late.

328
00:33:50,224 --> 00:33:51,782
I'm sorry. I'm late.

329
00:33:51,992 --> 00:33:53,254
Where you been?

330
00:33:53,594 --> 00:33:56,324
- They stop me because of the curfew.
- The curfew, huh?

331
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,157
Yes. I'm sorry.

332
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,158
Get started on this.
Tell them to start sending this out...

333
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:08,068
...but hold the last two paragraphs.
I'll have corrections in an hour.

334
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:13,302
They don't transmit today.
The transmitter at Kambol got hit.

335
00:34:14,981 --> 00:34:17,347
They say 6 p.m. We can file.

336
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,983
6 p.m.

337
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,987
What do you think this is?
A monthly magazine?

338
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,181
This is a newspaper.

339
00:34:29,162 --> 00:34:30,891
How about update tomorrow?

340
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:36,533
Yeah, sure. We can file
an update tomorrow.

341
00:34:46,011 --> 00:34:48,411
I was over at the
American Embassy yesterday.

342
00:34:49,648 --> 00:34:50,512
Good news?

343
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:52,513
No, not good news.

344
00:34:58,524 --> 00:35:01,254
They say that when
this place goes up...

345
00:35:04,663 --> 00:35:08,258
...they think a lot of people
will be killed. A lot of people.

346
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:13,164
I've arranged for the evacuation
of you and your family.

347
00:35:16,008 --> 00:35:18,442
So now it's up to you.
What do you want to do?

348
00:35:20,945 --> 00:35:22,970
Do you want to stay
or leave?

349
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:32,713
And how about you?

350
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:35,790
That's none of your business.

351
00:35:41,732 --> 00:35:44,462
Do you want to stay,
or do you want to leave?

352
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:49,233
I know.

353
00:35:50,007 --> 00:35:51,634
You love my family.

354
00:35:55,913 --> 00:35:58,814
But me, I'm reporter too.

355
00:35:59,517 --> 00:36:01,007
You know what I mean?

356
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:19,862
All right, we don't have
to decide this right now.

357
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,435
Take it easy.

358
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:29,570
But we'll have to make up our
minds pretty soon, right?

359
00:37:42,483 --> 00:37:45,179
All right, this is it!
Is the floor clear?

360
00:37:46,454 --> 00:37:48,149
This is the last check.

361
00:37:51,025 --> 00:37:53,585
Last check. This is the last check!

362
00:38:00,201 --> 00:38:01,691
Mr. Kincaid is not here.

363
00:38:02,003 --> 00:38:05,062
Mr. Kincaid is gone.
You keep Mr. Kincaid's money.

364
00:38:05,505 --> 00:38:07,302
Now, I want you to go right now!

365
00:38:07,741 --> 00:38:09,333
I want you to leave now!

366
00:38:09,543 --> 00:38:11,636
You won't see Mr. Kincaid again!

367
00:38:25,092 --> 00:38:27,287
Okay, sergeant, let him in!

368
00:38:30,464 --> 00:38:33,763
Have you got Pran here?
Have you got Pran on there?

369
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:36,595
- And his wife?
- Yes, sir, they are.

370
00:38:36,803 --> 00:38:40,034
- Did they come in yet?
- No, sir, they haven't arrived yet.

371
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:54,982
Have you seen Pran?

372
00:38:55,187 --> 00:38:56,176
No, I haven't.

373
00:38:56,956 --> 00:38:57,980
Where is he?

374
00:39:01,994 --> 00:39:03,791
Well, it's been real.

375
00:39:09,301 --> 00:39:10,791
They're gonna miss it.

376
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:14,095
Why don't you check around
the other side?

377
00:39:14,774 --> 00:39:17,800
If he comes here, I'm looking
for him in the back.

378
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:32,355
Beth! Have you seen Pran?

379
00:39:32,557 --> 00:39:34,752
No, have you looked at the hotel?

380
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:36,824
He's at the post office!

381
00:39:37,228 --> 00:39:38,820
The post office!

382
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:09,755
Get the fuck out!
Get out of here now!

383
00:40:10,027 --> 00:40:12,222
Move your asses out of here!

384
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:14,163
Hold those doors!

385
00:40:18,135 --> 00:40:21,070
- Where do you think you're going?
- To embassy.

386
00:40:36,954 --> 00:40:38,444
Yes, sir, what's your name?

387
00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:40,020
Dith Pran family, sir.

388
00:40:40,224 --> 00:40:41,987
Dith Pran family?

389
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:44,524
- Sydney Schanberg.
- They've been through.

390
00:40:44,995 --> 00:40:47,485
- They've been through.
- Check one more time, please.

391
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:49,961
- You made a mistake, sir.
- No mistake.

392
00:40:58,407 --> 00:40:59,874
Rockoff, help me!

393
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:13,035
Run!

394
00:43:13,506 --> 00:43:14,996
There's no time!

395
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:24,541
Wait a minute.

396
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:29,269
Smile.

397
00:44:56,206 --> 00:44:57,264
Jon.

398
00:44:57,841 --> 00:44:58,933
Hello, Sydney.

399
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:20,261
If the going gets rough, I heard
our best bet's the French Embassy.

400
00:45:23,033 --> 00:45:24,330
Who told you that?

401
00:45:27,303 --> 00:45:29,032
The British Embassy.

402
00:45:59,535 --> 00:46:01,196
Khmer Rouge coming.

403
00:46:01,403 --> 00:46:04,566
Look like government soldiers
give them big welcome.

404
00:47:08,902 --> 00:47:10,301
No more fighting!

405
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:12,001
I be right back!

406
00:47:28,155 --> 00:47:29,986
No more fighting! No more war!

407
00:47:30,423 --> 00:47:31,753
What do you think?

408
00:47:32,858 --> 00:47:34,587
I don't like the look of this.

409
00:47:34,793 --> 00:47:39,492
I was in Keng Kang this morning.
Practically got my ass shot off.

410
00:47:39,698 --> 00:47:42,633
I just don't think these guys
are for real.

411
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:46,099
I'm going to the hospital.
You want to come with me?

412
00:48:53,537 --> 00:48:55,903
Tetracaine, 50 milligrams, please.

413
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,470
Jesus, what am I supposed to do?
Sing her a lullaby?

414
00:48:59,676 --> 00:49:02,042
Pentothal, 150 milligrams, quick.

415
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:16,689
Jesus, another shrapnel
in the spine here.

416
00:49:16,893 --> 00:49:18,588
Okay, let's have her over.

417
00:49:24,401 --> 00:49:28,997
This is blood group A. We've had one
unit of blood in the last two days.

418
00:49:29,906 --> 00:49:31,931
Plasma substitute, please, quick.

419
00:49:32,843 --> 00:49:35,436
We've plenty of blood, gentlemen.
Plenty of blood.

420
00:49:35,645 --> 00:49:38,239
The problem is, it's all in
the wrong fucking place.

421
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:45,247
Why do corpses have to pile up before
people decide it's time to go home?

422
00:50:13,082 --> 00:50:15,606
For God's sake, back up the car!
Sarun, back it up!

423
00:50:15,817 --> 00:50:18,251
For God's sake, back it up now!

424
00:51:33,994 --> 00:51:37,520
- Why doesn't he get his ass in here?
- He's trying to get in!

425
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,327
They won't let him in.

426
00:52:02,922 --> 00:52:04,048
All right?

427
00:58:22,925 --> 00:58:23,857
Okay?

428
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:25,253
Looks all right.

429
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:26,728
I'm coming!

430
01:01:34,646 --> 01:01:36,671
Just a minute! He's with me!

431
01:01:36,948 --> 01:01:38,779
He's with The New York Times!

432
01:01:38,984 --> 01:01:42,181
Wait just a minute!
He's a journalist and he's with me!

433
01:01:42,754 --> 01:01:46,154
Where is the consul? I want to talk
to the consul. Let me see him!

434
01:01:46,423 --> 01:01:49,085
You tell me where he is.
I want to speak to him!

435
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:53,894
The picture in Cambodia
is increasingly unclear.

436
01:01:54,098 --> 01:01:57,499
Journalists who have flown
from Thailand over Phnom Penh...

437
01:01:57,701 --> 01:02:00,363
...report that the Khmer Rouge
have attempted...

438
01:02:00,571 --> 01:02:03,699
...a mass evacuation
of the entire population.

439
01:02:03,907 --> 01:02:08,469
Radio contact with the French Embassy
reveals that some 200 Europeans...

440
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:12,979
...and an undisclosed number
of Cambodians have taken refuge.

441
01:02:13,183 --> 01:02:17,313
As yet, no statement has been made
by the new rulers of Cambodia.

442
01:02:17,521 --> 01:02:22,083
The whereabouts of Prince Sihanouk
and the Khmer Rouge leadership...

443
01:02:22,292 --> 01:02:23,759
...are not clear.

444
01:02:29,665 --> 01:02:32,099
- Okay?
- Yes. He's sleeping.

445
01:02:57,894 --> 01:02:58,758
That's the consul.

446
01:03:08,036 --> 01:03:10,971
- Did you see that, Dennis?
- The Russians are coming.

447
01:03:17,212 --> 01:03:18,975
Look, piss off! Please!

448
01:03:19,181 --> 01:03:22,309
Get out! You won't get
anything here! Out!

449
01:03:30,058 --> 01:03:32,049
First, the main points of the news.

450
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:33,784
BBC, Dougal.

451
01:03:36,531 --> 01:03:39,364
- Daily reports of fighting
around the airport...

452
01:03:39,568 --> 01:03:43,402
...14 kilometers outside Phnom Penh,
the capital of Cambodia.

453
01:03:44,339 --> 01:03:48,274
And now, an on-the-spot report
from our correspondent in Thailand...

454
01:03:48,476 --> 01:03:49,534
...Hugh Elder.

455
01:03:51,479 --> 01:03:53,606
Where do they get this crap?

456
01:03:54,148 --> 01:03:57,276
Do you see that guy across the gate?
The little guy?

457
01:03:58,385 --> 01:04:00,910
Could we not all look at once, please?

458
01:04:01,689 --> 01:04:05,284
I have it on reliable sources
that that's Hugh Elder.

459
01:04:06,026 --> 01:04:06,856
You're kidding.

460
01:04:07,061 --> 01:04:10,519
He's disguised, but I got suspicious
about him. You know what I mean?

461
01:04:10,731 --> 01:04:13,700
- How does he get copy out?
- How does he get his copy out?

462
01:04:13,901 --> 01:04:15,630
With specially trained hens.

463
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:21,135
The BBC has, like, commissioned
them to walk past the Khmer Rouge...

464
01:04:21,342 --> 01:04:23,105
...like their regular fowl.

465
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:27,837
They've been crossing the border into
Thailand every day and every night.

466
01:04:28,915 --> 01:04:29,973
I told you.

467
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:34,115
Unconfirmed reports say
the Khmer Rouge are demanding...

468
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,949
...that any officials of
the defeated Lon Nol government...

469
01:04:38,158 --> 01:04:41,252
...especially the so-called
Six Traitors of the Cabinet...

470
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:43,088
...be handed over to them.

471
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,026
It is not known whether
any of the ex-ministers...

472
01:04:46,232 --> 01:04:48,325
...may have taken refuge
in the embassy...

473
01:04:48,535 --> 01:04:51,971
...where, in the words of a UNICEF
representative in Bangkok...

474
01:04:52,172 --> 01:04:56,108
...the situation is said to be
"increasingly precarious."

475
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:29,211
And when I tried to go
just a kilometer further, no.

476
01:06:29,417 --> 01:06:32,046
The only sense I can make of it
is that there's...

477
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:35,189
...some sort of internal
power struggle going on.

478
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:39,159
Different groups seem to be
holding different parts of the city...

479
01:06:39,863 --> 01:06:44,664
...and they all appear to be equally
nervous over losing power and control.

480
01:06:45,235 --> 01:06:47,260
Half of them are under 15.

481
01:06:47,971 --> 01:06:50,907
Some Red Cross instruction
sheets want translating.

482
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:52,097
Can you help?

483
01:06:52,443 --> 01:06:54,877
Use Pran. He speaks French
better than I do.

484
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:57,138
I'd prefer it if it was you.

485
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:09,950
What did you do that for?

486
01:07:10,395 --> 01:07:12,556
The guy's insecure enough already.

487
01:07:14,833 --> 01:07:17,359
The Cambodians have
to leave the embassy.

488
01:07:20,072 --> 01:07:23,633
They want all our passports
and everybody downstairs...

489
01:07:24,143 --> 01:07:26,203
...and the Cambodians out.

490
01:08:04,221 --> 01:08:06,018
If you have papers,
you have a name.

491
01:08:06,223 --> 01:08:08,418
If we have a name,
we can find the mother.

492
01:08:09,192 --> 01:08:11,821
Look, I fight for five years.

493
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:13,828
Useless war.

494
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:17,601
Fuck!

495
01:08:20,004 --> 01:08:22,769
Pran is not gonna last
five minutes out there.

496
01:08:22,975 --> 01:08:26,741
The Khmer Rouge have killed every
journalist they've ever caught.

497
01:08:27,112 --> 01:08:28,807
Does Syd know how serious this is?

498
01:08:29,014 --> 01:08:32,677
- Of course he bloody knows!
- We can't let him walk out of here.

499
01:08:33,452 --> 01:08:37,513
Look, two passports. This one's
out-of-date, but the visa's valid.

500
01:08:37,723 --> 01:08:39,919
Jon Ankertill Brewer Swain.

501
01:08:40,126 --> 01:08:44,324
Knock out the Jon, knock out the Swain,
and you're left with Ankertill Brewer.

502
01:08:44,998 --> 01:08:48,435
Change my photograph for one of Pran,
and he's a British subject.

503
01:08:48,636 --> 01:08:49,864
It's worth a try.

504
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:53,970
I hope he's got a photo because
I don't have any fucking film.

505
01:09:08,491 --> 01:09:10,822
I try to escape to Thailand right now.

506
01:09:11,026 --> 01:09:12,789
Give me two or three weeks.

507
01:09:14,262 --> 01:09:16,322
If you get there first, let me know.

508
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:19,629
And leave message for me
at Reuters. Okay?

509
01:09:20,469 --> 01:09:24,200
Just give me an hour.
I need some time to think.

510
01:09:25,108 --> 01:09:27,099
I got no time to give you.

511
01:09:28,712 --> 01:09:30,475
Swain's got an idea.

512
01:09:36,621 --> 01:09:38,885
Ankertill Brewer.
That's the new name.

513
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:41,615
- Ankertill Brewer.
- Right. Now, my photograph.

514
01:09:41,826 --> 01:09:44,853
- Change my photograph for yours.
- Do you have an old photo?

515
01:09:45,064 --> 01:09:46,053
I don't think so.

516
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:48,593
Give him your passport.

517
01:09:48,801 --> 01:09:50,961
Your old passport,
a family snapshot, anything.

518
01:09:51,169 --> 01:09:52,228
Khmer Rouge took everything.

519
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,463
- What about your press card?
- Everything!

520
01:09:54,673 --> 01:09:55,537
Fuck!

521
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:58,736
- Didn't give it back.
- We'll go and find some film.

522
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:02,972
There's film here. We'll get it.
Polaroid, any kind, any speed.

523
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:06,746
We're gonna get it,
and I'll shoot it, okay?

524
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,443
We'll find the film.

525
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:12,957
Do you have a Polaroid camera?
Do you have film?

526
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,718
No, I haven't got any film!

527
01:10:14,929 --> 01:10:19,560
I've also got no metronidazole, and
this child has got amebic dysentery!

528
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:24,534
We've gotta get sulfide
and a developer.

529
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:26,935
If we can get that,
I can make the photo.

530
01:10:27,275 --> 01:10:28,242
Shit!

531
01:10:28,745 --> 01:10:32,544
Listen, I know where we can get
some water. We can drain...

532
01:10:32,748 --> 01:10:36,081
...the air conditioning vent.
I've seen it done. Come on.

533
01:10:41,157 --> 01:10:43,990
Excuse me, you're Mr. Schanberg?

534
01:10:44,894 --> 01:10:48,422
I've been told that you're
in charge of bed covers.

535
01:10:48,632 --> 01:10:49,530
What?

536
01:10:50,868 --> 01:10:54,702
Blankets. We've just arrived.
We want some blankets.

537
01:10:56,107 --> 01:10:57,768
Come on down here.

538
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:00,310
Go to the end of the hall there.

539
01:11:01,646 --> 01:11:03,637
Turn to the right,
go up the stairs.

540
01:11:03,848 --> 01:11:07,182
If there are any, they'll be
at the top of the stairs.

541
01:11:07,386 --> 01:11:10,651
Syd, I have got the camera...

542
01:11:11,357 --> 01:11:12,948
...I have got the film...

543
01:11:13,425 --> 01:11:16,418
...and I have got
the fucking darkroom!

544
01:11:21,133 --> 01:11:23,363
All right. Don't smile.

545
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:29,031
- You're smiling.
- Very serious. You are smiling.

546
01:11:29,476 --> 01:11:30,841
Stop, please.

547
01:11:31,044 --> 01:11:34,037
- Very serious.
- Very serious, very American.

548
01:11:48,994 --> 01:11:50,120
Okay, cover it.

549
01:11:55,868 --> 01:11:58,098
This fucking paper, I don't know.

550
01:11:58,837 --> 01:12:01,432
That was the stuff you found
in the coatroom.

551
01:12:03,576 --> 01:12:05,305
Ankertill Brewer.

552
01:12:06,179 --> 01:12:08,613
Ankertill Brewer.

553
01:12:24,232 --> 01:12:26,564
Getting an image.
Look at it.

554
01:12:26,768 --> 01:12:28,327
Look, the bugger's face.

555
01:12:28,538 --> 01:12:30,802
It sure is. Come on.

556
01:12:31,741 --> 01:12:33,003
Come on.

557
01:12:34,009 --> 01:12:35,101
Come on.

558
01:12:36,678 --> 01:12:38,203
Now fix it.

559
01:12:39,916 --> 01:12:41,349
That's good.

560
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,951
Oh, no. Fuck, it's fogging.

561
01:12:47,257 --> 01:12:48,588
Goddamn it.

562
01:12:49,927 --> 01:12:51,656
Goddamn this paper!

563
01:12:51,862 --> 01:12:55,128
Goddamn it!
We're gonna have to start again.

564
01:13:04,577 --> 01:13:06,169
Okay, now we gotta fix it.

565
01:13:08,314 --> 01:13:09,372
I did it.

566
01:13:11,617 --> 01:13:13,050
Let me have that.

567
01:13:15,621 --> 01:13:16,781
It's fading.

568
01:13:17,723 --> 01:13:18,690
Take it out.

569
01:13:18,891 --> 01:13:22,692
No, it's already gone. The solution's
too strong. It's fading.

570
01:13:22,896 --> 01:13:24,659
Take it out now.
I mean, if it's...

571
01:13:24,865 --> 01:13:25,923
Fuck!

572
01:13:27,033 --> 01:13:28,500
Goddamn it!

573
01:13:32,507 --> 01:13:35,908
Man, this fucking room is killing me.

574
01:13:36,177 --> 01:13:37,508
Could I just...?

575
01:13:37,945 --> 01:13:39,776
I'll just do it myself, okay?

576
01:13:39,981 --> 01:13:43,315
Let me just have a few feet
in here by myself.

577
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,277
Fuck.

578
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:47,587
Sorry.

579
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:03,466
That's it.

580
01:14:20,192 --> 01:14:21,591
It's perfect.

581
01:14:22,928 --> 01:14:24,054
Perfect.

582
01:14:38,844 --> 01:14:41,142
Welcome to New York. We got it.

583
01:14:41,347 --> 01:14:43,508
Perfect. Rockoff, perfect!

584
01:14:43,716 --> 01:14:46,413
Ankertill Brewer. Ankertill Brewer.

585
01:14:46,653 --> 01:14:50,282
All right, you jokers, would you like
to bring your passports over to me?

586
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:52,958
This is the last call for passports.

587
01:14:53,727 --> 01:14:55,389
Can I have your passports, please?

588
01:14:56,164 --> 01:14:58,132
Can I have your passports, please?

589
01:14:59,534 --> 01:15:00,523
Thank you.

590
01:15:00,835 --> 01:15:02,894
Passports, ladies and gents.

591
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:08,267
All right, you jokers, this is your
last chance to get your passports in.

592
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,778
Your passports, please.

593
01:15:12,983 --> 01:15:15,144
On this passport depend my life.

594
01:15:16,819 --> 01:15:17,649
Thank you.

595
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:22,187
Passports, ladies. This is for
the big tour, the big package.

596
01:15:24,794 --> 01:15:28,252
From Thursday Island right down
to Mount Macedon...

597
01:15:28,465 --> 01:15:31,026
...to see the famous Hanging Rock.

598
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,827
Come on, passports, please.

599
01:15:34,205 --> 01:15:36,298
Ladies and gentlemen, last call.

600
01:15:36,507 --> 01:15:37,701
Going...

601
01:15:38,209 --> 01:15:39,039
...going...

602
01:15:43,682 --> 01:15:44,706
...gone.

603
01:16:16,517 --> 01:16:17,712
Is this lunch?

604
01:16:23,325 --> 01:16:24,189
What?

605
01:16:27,396 --> 01:16:29,455
It seems certain
that the majority...

606
01:16:29,665 --> 01:16:34,398
...of Phnom Penh's population has
been evacuated to the countryside.

607
01:16:34,603 --> 01:16:37,970
The population is swollen
with thousands of refugees.

608
01:16:38,274 --> 01:16:39,332
Hello again.

609
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:48,743
It'll be argued by some that this is
a way of coping with postwar chaos.

610
01:16:49,152 --> 01:16:51,620
Dennis, can you turn
that down, please?

611
01:16:54,092 --> 01:16:55,753
Now, listen, everybody.

612
01:16:57,695 --> 01:17:02,098
The trucks which we've seen arriving
are for our evacuation.

613
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,268
Probably in the next 24 hours.

614
01:17:05,971 --> 01:17:08,462
Now, listen. That's to be confirmed.

615
01:17:08,941 --> 01:17:10,966
It's almost certainly for Thailand.

616
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:23,579
These so-called journalists
have no right...

617
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:27,954
You're not biased? You haven't
seen any atrocities in Cambodia?

618
01:17:28,161 --> 01:17:31,825
- It's just an emotional spasm!
- Yes, it is, yes. So just shut up!

619
01:17:32,032 --> 01:17:34,398
You have to break eggs
to make an omelet!

620
01:18:28,394 --> 01:18:30,828
Sydney, Ankertill Brewer.

621
01:20:41,437 --> 01:20:44,464
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Good luck.

622
01:20:46,476 --> 01:20:48,740
- Give me these back in Paris.
- Goodbye.

623
01:20:48,945 --> 01:20:50,572
Don't forget. All right?

624
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:53,682
Why didn't you get him out
when you had the chance?

625
01:20:53,884 --> 01:20:55,647
You had no right to keep him here!

626
01:20:55,853 --> 01:20:57,980
You've got a funny
sense of priorities.

627
01:20:58,189 --> 01:21:01,159
I'm a reporter too, Morgan.
I know his heart.

628
01:21:01,393 --> 01:21:03,452
- I love him like my brother.
- Sure.

629
01:21:03,662 --> 01:21:06,654
And I do anything for him.
Anything.

630
01:21:12,338 --> 01:21:13,703
Goodbye, Rockoff.

631
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:38,691
Tell my wife I love her...

632
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:41,232
...and look after all my children.

633
01:21:42,537 --> 01:21:45,973
She doesn't speak any English.

634
01:21:47,877 --> 01:21:49,276
Please...

635
01:21:49,945 --> 01:21:53,540
...I don't want anyone
to be bad to my wife.

636
01:22:29,688 --> 01:22:31,087
Dith Pran.

637
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:35,222
P-R-A-N.
He disappeared in Phnom Penh in 1975.

638
01:22:35,428 --> 01:22:38,625
Pran is his first name.
Any information you can give.

639
01:22:39,566 --> 01:22:42,558
Well, we're hoping
for any information at all.

640
01:22:43,169 --> 01:22:46,536
He was last seen in '75.
Can you get me that number again?

641
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:47,570
In April 1975.

642
01:22:47,774 --> 01:22:52,474
4144-5364...

643
01:23:24,447 --> 01:23:26,677
Pran is a resourceful man.

644
01:23:26,883 --> 01:23:29,512
He will wait until he knows
that it's safe...

645
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,551
...and then he'll make his move.

646
01:23:47,973 --> 01:23:50,669
Thank you for coming...

647
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:53,070
...and taking care of her
and her family.

648
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:56,738
But she knows that
her husband is dead.

649
01:23:57,384 --> 01:23:58,749
That's not true.

650
01:24:00,453 --> 01:24:02,853
That's absolutely not true.

651
01:24:10,530 --> 01:24:12,657
It's not true. It's not.

652
01:24:13,935 --> 01:24:15,800
She doesn't believe you...

653
01:24:16,003 --> 01:24:19,063
...because she knows
her husband is dead.

654
01:24:42,199 --> 01:24:43,393
You're a good man.

655
01:24:45,802 --> 01:24:49,761
If your mother needs anything,
make sure she gets in touch with me.

656
01:24:53,744 --> 01:24:55,075
You better go.

657
01:26:36,389 --> 01:26:38,016
For the past 5 years...

658
01:26:38,591 --> 01:26:41,686
...as indicated on this map
that you see here...

659
01:26:42,129 --> 01:26:46,565
...North Vietnam has occupied
military sanctuaries...

660
01:26:46,766 --> 01:26:50,828
...all along the Cambodian frontier
with South Vietnam.

661
01:26:51,405 --> 01:26:52,736
As the President spoke...

662
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:56,467
...American troops were preparing
to move into Cambodia.

663
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:02,615
The decision to invade, like
the earlier secret decision to bomb...

664
01:27:02,817 --> 01:27:04,785
...was withheld from
the Cambodian people.

665
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:08,385
We will yell at the top of our lungs.
We will move.

666
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:13,857
It's the fear that makes a man
so scared, you know?

667
01:27:20,437 --> 01:27:23,406
There are no American
combat advisors in Cambodia.

668
01:27:23,607 --> 01:27:27,338
There will be no American
combat troops or advisors in Cambodia.

669
01:27:27,544 --> 01:27:29,068
We will aid Cambodia.

670
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:33,682
Cambodia is the Nixon doctrine
in its purest form.

671
01:32:36,879 --> 01:32:38,006
Sydney...

672
01:32:38,749 --> 01:32:42,685
...I think of you often
and often my family.

673
01:32:43,353 --> 01:32:46,686
They tell us that God is dead.

674
01:32:46,923 --> 01:32:50,155
And now the party they call
the Angka...

675
01:32:50,361 --> 01:32:53,090
...will provide everything for us.

676
01:32:53,730 --> 01:32:56,666
He says Angka has identified...

677
01:32:56,868 --> 01:32:58,859
...and proclaims the existence...

678
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:01,300
...of a bad new disease...

679
01:33:01,506 --> 01:33:06,410
...a memory sickness diagnosed
as thinking too much about life...

680
01:33:06,612 --> 01:33:09,581
...in prerevolutionary Cambodia.

681
01:33:10,482 --> 01:33:14,510
He says we are surrounded by enemies.

682
01:33:15,088 --> 01:33:17,522
The enemy is inside us.

683
01:33:18,024 --> 01:33:20,219
No one can be trusted.

684
01:33:29,503 --> 01:33:31,993
We must be like the ox...

685
01:33:32,205 --> 01:33:35,903
...and have no thought
except for the Party.

686
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:39,546
No love but for the Angka.

687
01:33:44,252 --> 01:33:45,776
People starve...

688
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:49,215
...but we must not grow food.

689
01:33:52,161 --> 01:33:54,129
We must honor the comrade children...

690
01:33:54,330 --> 01:33:57,595
...whose minds are not corrupted
by the past.

691
01:34:26,264 --> 01:34:27,663
Is anybody of us...

692
01:34:27,867 --> 01:34:28,731
...a doctor...

693
01:34:29,368 --> 01:34:30,460
...professor...

694
01:34:30,703 --> 01:34:32,136
...and student?

695
01:34:32,605 --> 01:34:34,402
Angka needs you.

696
01:34:35,241 --> 01:34:37,210
Angka has forgiven all the past.

697
01:34:52,126 --> 01:34:53,217
Sydney...

698
01:34:54,261 --> 01:34:58,722
...Angka says that those
who were guilty of soft living...

699
01:34:58,933 --> 01:35:01,595
...in the years
of the great struggle...

700
01:35:01,802 --> 01:35:05,899
...and did not care for the sufferings
of the peasant must confess...

701
01:35:06,975 --> 01:35:10,035
...because now is the year zero...

702
01:35:10,312 --> 01:35:12,974
...and everything is to start anew.

703
01:35:21,624 --> 01:35:23,786
I'm full of fear, Sydney.

704
01:35:24,228 --> 01:35:27,026
I must show no understanding.

705
01:35:27,565 --> 01:35:29,692
Not of French or English.

706
01:35:30,167 --> 01:35:32,398
I must have no past, Sydney.

707
01:35:33,704 --> 01:35:35,831
This is the year zero...

708
01:35:36,407 --> 01:35:38,637
...and nothing has gone before.

709
01:35:50,823 --> 01:35:54,657
The wind whispers of fear and hate.

710
01:35:55,061 --> 01:35:58,053
The war has killed love, Sydney.

711
01:35:58,497 --> 01:36:02,195
And those who confess
to the Angka vanish.

712
01:36:02,536 --> 01:36:05,903
And no one dare ask where they go.

713
01:36:06,273 --> 01:36:10,574
Here, only the silent survive.

714
01:41:54,917 --> 01:41:57,512
Mercedes, number one!

715
01:47:30,915 --> 01:47:35,318
Anyone who knows my work will know
that half of this belongs to Dith Pran.

716
01:47:37,923 --> 01:47:41,916
Without Pran, I wouldn't have been able
to file half the stories I did.

717
01:47:44,195 --> 01:47:47,688
It's nice to congratulate ourselves
on occasions like this.

718
01:47:48,033 --> 01:47:50,160
But I can't stand here tonight...

719
01:47:50,369 --> 01:47:53,031
...without thinking
of those innocent people...

720
01:47:53,238 --> 01:47:57,869
...Pran dedicated himself to helping
me bring to the notice of the public.

721
01:48:00,646 --> 01:48:04,083
As they pondered their options
in the White House...

722
01:48:04,284 --> 01:48:08,618
...the men who decided to bomb
and then to invade Cambodia...

723
01:48:09,289 --> 01:48:11,723
...concerned themselves
with many things:

724
01:48:13,094 --> 01:48:17,155
Great power conflicts
and collapsing dominoes...

725
01:48:18,466 --> 01:48:21,333
...looking tough and dangerous
to the North Vietnamese...

726
01:48:21,636 --> 01:48:25,936
...relieving pressure on the American
troop withdrawal from the South.

727
01:48:26,908 --> 01:48:29,172
They had domestic concerns as well...

728
01:48:29,377 --> 01:48:34,179
...which helps explain why they kept
the bombing of Cambodia a secret.

729
01:48:35,017 --> 01:48:38,714
And they may be assumed not to have
ignored self-interest...

730
01:48:38,921 --> 01:48:40,514
...in their own careers.

731
01:48:41,291 --> 01:48:43,987
What they specifically were not
concerned with...

732
01:48:44,194 --> 01:48:46,719
...were the Cambodians themselves.

733
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:48,961
Not the people...

734
01:48:49,433 --> 01:48:51,425
...not the society...

735
01:48:51,903 --> 01:48:53,530
...not the country.

736
01:48:54,806 --> 01:48:58,173
Except in the abstract
as instruments of policy.

737
01:49:02,114 --> 01:49:03,877
Dith Pran and I...

738
01:49:04,616 --> 01:49:06,606
...tried to record and bring home...

739
01:49:06,818 --> 01:49:10,585
...the concrete consequences
of these decisions to real people.

740
01:49:11,123 --> 01:49:12,920
To human beings...

741
01:49:14,226 --> 01:49:16,990
...the people left out
of the Administration's plans...

742
01:49:17,197 --> 01:49:19,028
...but who paid the price...

743
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:21,427
...and took the beating for them.

744
01:49:26,907 --> 01:49:31,071
I'm very pleased to accept this
on behalf of Dith Pran and myself.

745
01:49:31,612 --> 01:49:33,239
I'm very honored...

746
01:49:33,914 --> 01:49:36,577
...and I know that Pran would be
very proud.

747
01:49:49,297 --> 01:49:53,028
Do you plan to continue
with that theme in the future?

748
01:49:55,705 --> 01:49:58,469
Congratulations, Ernie.
Do it again next year!

749
01:49:58,674 --> 01:50:00,073
I'm sorry.

750
01:50:03,146 --> 01:50:06,047
- That was great, really good.
- Better than last year.

751
01:50:06,950 --> 01:50:09,510
Abe, meet my sister.

752
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:11,551
I'm very happy to meet you.

753
01:50:11,755 --> 01:50:14,224
That's my dad.
Would you hold this for me?

754
01:50:15,326 --> 01:50:16,293
One second.

755
01:50:16,494 --> 01:50:19,691
I hoped you could recommend
a good school for journalism.

756
01:50:19,898 --> 01:50:22,868
I told my daughter I'd be
seeing you today.

757
01:50:23,068 --> 01:50:25,934
Just one minute, okay?
I'll be right back.

758
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:38,880
Could I have your autograph?
I'm a great admirer of yours.

759
01:50:41,488 --> 01:50:44,184
Congratulations on your award,
it was well-deserved.

760
01:50:44,391 --> 01:50:47,656
Very impressive.
I was hoping you'd burst into song.

761
01:50:49,130 --> 01:50:51,860
- What are you doing here?
- You know what bothers me?

762
01:50:52,066 --> 01:50:52,896
What?

763
01:50:53,301 --> 01:50:55,997
It bothers me that you let Pran
stay in Cambodia...

764
01:50:56,203 --> 01:50:59,332
...because you wanted to win,
and you knew you needed him...

765
01:50:59,541 --> 01:51:02,271
- I didn't have any idea what...
- The fuck you didn't!

766
01:51:04,179 --> 01:51:06,306
The fuck you didn't.

767
01:51:06,914 --> 01:51:10,407
I did everything I could,
and I'm doing everything I can.

768
01:51:10,619 --> 01:51:12,951
Nice to see you.
I'm on my way to Florida.

769
01:51:13,155 --> 01:51:14,713
I'm doing everything I can.

770
01:51:14,923 --> 01:51:18,223
I'm sure. I didn't realize
you'd been out there to see him.

771
01:51:18,428 --> 01:51:21,693
Don't play games with me, Al.
Don't play stupid games.

772
01:51:21,898 --> 01:51:25,562
Nobody gets to go in there.
If I thought I could, I would.

773
01:51:26,437 --> 01:51:28,462
I've sent out hundreds of photographs.

774
01:51:28,672 --> 01:51:32,335
Every relief organization
on the Thai-Kampuchean border...

775
01:51:36,047 --> 01:51:39,847
...has got his picture. If I saw
one glimmer of hope, I'd go today.

776
01:51:40,385 --> 01:51:41,909
Life isn't a '40s movie.

777
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:45,955
You can't just get on a plane and
make the whole world come out right!

778
01:51:47,559 --> 01:51:50,357
And I can't believe
I'm hearing this from you!

779
01:51:55,167 --> 01:51:56,464
Congrats.

780
01:51:58,537 --> 01:52:01,097
Do you keep in touch
with Dith Pran's family?

781
01:52:01,307 --> 01:52:03,503
Yes. They're living in San Francisco.

782
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:06,577
How do you respond to accusations
that journalists...

783
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:09,146
...underestimated the brutality
of the Khmer Rouge...

784
01:52:09,349 --> 01:52:13,081
...and so share responsibility for
what happened in Cambodia afterwards?

785
01:52:13,755 --> 01:52:15,586
We made a mistake.

786
01:52:16,157 --> 01:52:18,751
Maybe we underestimated
the kind of insanity...

787
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:21,486
...that $ 7 billion worth
of bombing could produce.

788
01:52:21,697 --> 01:52:22,857
That is provocative...

789
01:52:23,065 --> 01:52:26,466
There have been a lot of refugee
stories in Reader's Digest...

790
01:52:26,669 --> 01:52:29,102
...about Cambodia.
Do you believe them?

791
01:52:29,303 --> 01:52:30,862
Don't you believe them?

792
01:52:31,073 --> 01:52:34,941
Maybe in this instance the
Reader's Digest happens to be correct.

793
01:52:35,144 --> 01:52:37,442
Do you apply the same disbelief
to stories...

794
01:52:37,646 --> 01:52:40,138
...that come out of Iran
or Palestine or Chile?

795
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:42,716
Are refugees your next area
of interest?

796
01:52:42,919 --> 01:52:45,353
Will you be covering the boat people?

797
01:52:45,555 --> 01:52:46,681
No, I will not.

798
01:52:46,890 --> 01:52:48,586
Do you want a cup of tea?

799
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:53,155
Are you looking around for some kind
of more salable suffering?

800
01:52:55,733 --> 01:52:58,362
I must have sent 500 letters.

801
01:53:03,875 --> 01:53:07,607
I wrote the International Red Cross,
the World Health Organization.

802
01:53:07,814 --> 01:53:10,509
I know you did, Syd.
You told me.

803
01:53:11,016 --> 01:53:13,280
I don't know who I didn't write to.

804
01:53:19,759 --> 01:53:22,421
I never really gave him any choice.

805
01:53:27,868 --> 01:53:30,996
One time we tried to discuss leaving.

806
01:53:39,948 --> 01:53:43,407
I talked to him about it,
but we never really discussed it.

807
01:53:46,722 --> 01:53:50,020
I discussed it with Swain and Rockoff.

808
01:53:54,029 --> 01:53:56,554
But I never discussed it with him.

809
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:10,680
He stayed because
I wanted him to stay.

810
01:54:16,721 --> 01:54:18,586
And I stayed because...

811
01:57:58,027 --> 01:57:59,893
I'm trapped, Sydney.

812
01:58:00,096 --> 01:58:04,294
I know he suspects me,
and yet he treats me well.

813
01:58:04,934 --> 01:58:08,335
There are many different groups
over here, Sydney.

814
01:58:08,638 --> 01:58:10,732
I must take much care.

815
01:58:11,275 --> 01:58:15,336
Now Angka says we have new enemies.

816
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:20,784
They say we must regain
our old lands from the Vietnamese.

817
01:58:21,553 --> 01:58:25,455
And now they say we must fight them.

818
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:31,458
I miss you, my wife, my children.

819
01:58:31,664 --> 01:58:35,121
And my heart hungers for news of you.

820
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:00,784
New China Radio reports...

821
01:59:00,995 --> 01:59:04,295
...that fighting between Vietnam
and Democratic Kampuchea...

822
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:06,866
...has broken out
on a number of fronts.

823
01:59:07,136 --> 01:59:09,866
This is in retaliation,
according to the Vietnamese...

824
01:59:10,072 --> 01:59:12,506
...for a number of attacks
on border villages...

825
01:59:16,245 --> 01:59:17,610
Taxi driver, huh?

826
01:59:35,466 --> 01:59:37,297
I think you speak English.

827
01:59:37,768 --> 01:59:39,065
Sit down.

828
01:59:45,277 --> 01:59:47,802
You know, I love this country.

829
01:59:49,615 --> 01:59:52,414
I sacrificed everything for it.

830
01:59:53,887 --> 01:59:57,378
My wife died for the revolution.

831
01:59:59,292 --> 02:00:03,991
But the leaders of Angka
no longer trust the people.

832
02:00:04,931 --> 02:00:08,493
Therefore, I can no longer trust them.

833
02:00:10,337 --> 02:00:12,396
And they don't trust me.

834
02:00:14,909 --> 02:00:15,773
I fear...

835
02:00:17,178 --> 02:00:19,511
...really fear for the future.

836
02:00:23,919 --> 02:00:27,412
I think you love my son.

837
02:00:30,526 --> 02:00:31,788
For his sake...

838
02:00:32,862 --> 02:00:34,261
...look after him.

839
02:00:38,901 --> 02:00:41,495
The fighting is close by, Sydney.

840
02:00:41,704 --> 02:00:44,172
If the Vietnamese get here...

841
02:00:44,373 --> 02:00:46,535
...Angka will destroy everything...

842
02:00:48,679 --> 02:00:50,237
...and the Vietnamese,
they will find only ashes.

843
02:03:59,585 --> 02:04:03,021
I must try to stop the killing.
Good luck.

844
02:13:22,429 --> 02:13:24,329
Yeah, I'll be right there, Brian.

845
02:13:27,267 --> 02:13:31,226
Ann, get me 415-555-6421.

846
02:13:31,438 --> 02:13:33,133
Abe, I've got some great news!

847
02:13:46,355 --> 02:13:49,415
Twenty minutes ago, I get
a phone call from Paris.

848
02:13:49,625 --> 02:13:52,526
I get Andreas Freund.
He talked to Henry.

849
02:13:52,728 --> 02:13:54,822
He told him how to get in touch
with me.

850
02:13:55,031 --> 02:13:57,898
Freund says, "I have got
some great news for you."

851
02:13:58,101 --> 02:14:00,729
- San Francisco's on the line.
- "It's about Pran!"

852
02:14:01,104 --> 02:14:02,800
Is your mother there?

853
02:14:05,409 --> 02:14:06,568
When?

854
02:14:08,978 --> 02:14:11,641
All right,
I want you to get this down.

855
02:14:12,483 --> 02:14:15,145
No, write it down. Write it down.

856
02:14:16,687 --> 02:14:18,814
I've got a message from your dad!

857
02:15:31,768 --> 02:15:32,962
How you been?

858
02:15:46,051 --> 02:15:47,075
Do you forgive me?

859
02:15:47,786 --> 02:15:50,380
Nothing to forgive, Sydney.
Nothing.
