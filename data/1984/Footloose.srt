And he <i>is</i> testing us.

30
00:02:41,213 --> 00:02:46,082
Every, every day, our
Lord is testing us.

31
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:48,143
If he wasn't testing us...

32
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,381
how would you account...

33
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:53,323
for the sorry state of our society...

34
00:02:53,392 --> 00:02:56,293
for the crimes...

35
00:02:56,362 --> 00:02:59,729
that plague the big
cities of this country...

36
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:04,566
when he could sweep this pestilence
from the face of the earth...

37
00:03:04,637 --> 00:03:07,538
with one mighty gesture of his hand?

38
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:12,035
If our Lord wasn't testing
us, how would you account...

39
00:03:12,111 --> 00:03:14,045
for the proliferation these days...

40
00:03:14,113 --> 00:03:18,140
of this obscene rock and roll music...

41
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:22,517
with its gospel of easy sexuality...

42
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:24,556
and relaxed morality?

43
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:29,156
If our Lord wasn't testing us,
why, he could take all...

44
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:33,358
these pornographic books and albums...

45
00:03:33,432 --> 00:03:37,528
and turn them into one big
fiery cinder like that!

46
00:03:37,603 --> 00:03:42,336
But how would that make
us stronger for him?

47
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:50,773
One of these days, my Lord
is going to come to me...

48
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,250
and ask me for an explanation...

49
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:56,618
for the lives of each
and every one of you.

50
00:03:58,224 --> 00:04:01,022
What am I going to
tell him on that day?

51
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:06,255
That I was busy? That I was tired?

52
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,133
That I was bored?

53
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:11,999
No! I can never let up!

54
00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:15,006
I welcome his test.

55
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:17,065
I welcome this challenge
from my Lord...

56
00:04:17,143 --> 00:04:20,909
so that one day I can deliver
all of you unto his hands.

57
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,380
And when that day dawns...

58
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:26,316
I don't want to have
to do any explaining!

59
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:30,116
I don't want to be missing...

60
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:32,214
from your lives!

61
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,919
Praise the Lord in singing...

62
00:04:34,994 --> 00:04:38,225
hymn number 397...

63
00:04:38,297 --> 00:04:42,097

I will. You have a good week now. Bye.

68
00:05:02,154 --> 00:05:06,215
Mrs. McCormack, your sister has
us so excited about you coming.

69
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:08,658
- Thank you.
- Did you meet my wife, Vi?

70
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:11,958
- No. How do you do?
- How nice to meet you.

71
00:05:12,031 --> 00:05:14,499
- This is my son, Ren.
- Hello, Ren.

72
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:17,365
- Would you excuse me?
- Daddy?

73
00:05:17,436 --> 00:05:20,530
Oh, Ariel, will you come
and meet the McCormacks?

74
00:05:20,606 --> 00:05:22,540
The stunning new gentleman.

75
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:26,044
This is Mrs. McCormack and her son.
Is it Ren?

76
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:27,245
Ren.

77
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:31,350
Ren's going to be new at
the high school tomorrow.

78
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,350
- Hi.
- Hi.

79
00:05:34,053 --> 00:05:38,888
Daddy, Me, Edna, Wendy Jo, and Rusty are
going for a soda at the Hi-Spot. Okay?

80
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,984
Ariel, remember you
have school tomorrow.

81
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:43,487
I'll be home for supper.

82
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,062
God, is he excellent!

83
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:49,225
What, the new kid? He's all right.

84
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:51,826
Are you blind? He is gorgeous!

85
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:54,873
- So, have you seen the new high school?
- No, I haven't.

86
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,070
Oh my god, I almost forgot.
Cindy Addis had her baby.

87
00:05:59,144 --> 00:06:01,374
What was it? Who told you?

88
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:04,905
- My mother spoke to her mother.
- Is she coming back for graduation?

89
00:06:04,984 --> 00:06:06,918
I don't feel a bit sorry for her.

90
00:06:06,986 --> 00:06:09,716
You can't buy a diaphragm through the mail.
I'm serious.

91
00:06:10,823 --> 00:06:12,848
Did she decide who the father was?

92
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:14,552
There's no question.
It was Duane Capps.

93
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:18,893
Wait a minute! I've been going with Duane Capps.
He'd never have the time.

94
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:20,659
How long does it take, Wendy Jo?

95
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:23,224
Ladies and gentlemen,
moving up behind us...

96
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:26,829
you'll notice the
incredible barf-mobile.

97
00:06:29,842 --> 00:06:31,935
Come on!

98
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:36,005
Hi, girls. Goin' my way?

99
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:38,345
You lonely tonight?

100
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:42,285
- You want a race, you got a race!
- What, that piece of junk?

101
00:06:42,354 --> 00:06:45,551
- Step on it!
- I am steppin' on it!

102
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,860
Come on! No guts, huh?

103
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:02,702
- In back of us, buddy!
- Take this, Rusty.

104
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:05,710
- Come on!
- You chicken!

105
00:07:05,778 --> 00:07:11,239
- Come on, take you all on, girl.
- Come on! Come on, Chuck!

106
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:14,252
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

107
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,695
Edna, slow down okay, please.

108
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,949
Throw it, honey. Throw it.

109
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:20,787
Stop it!

110
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:22,292
I'll get closer.

111
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:25,262
You can do it. Keep coming!

112
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:34,231
Ariel, will you stop it? Now!

113
00:07:34,306 --> 00:07:37,764
Stop showing off! It's not funny!
You're gonna kill yourself!

114
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:44,106
Look, please be careful!

115
00:07:44,183 --> 00:07:47,016
He's testing us! He's testing us!

116
00:07:51,223 --> 00:07:53,623
Ariel, watch out, there's a truck!

117
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,361
Get in the car!

118
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:06,466
Shit! Get in the truck!

119
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:08,130
Get in the car!

120
00:08:12,177 --> 00:08:13,474
Be careful!

121
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:24,354
Come on! Get in!

122
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,157
Get in!

123
00:08:37,536 --> 00:08:40,699
Jesus, we should never
have let her done that.

124
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:53,346
- Have you met any of your teachers?
- No, I haven't had a chance.

125
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:55,717
They've only been here eight hours.

126
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:59,383
I took care of that last week.
Registered him and everything.

127
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,086
I made you some of those Toll
House squares I promised.

128
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,994
Lulu, you taste one of these,
you'll burn your recipe.

129
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:06,998
Reverend, we have a little problem.

130
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:10,524
I heard the English teacher is
planning to teach that book.

131
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:13,537
Slaughterhouse Five.
Isn't that an awful name?

132
00:09:13,605 --> 00:09:16,073
That's a great book.

133
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:22,972
Slaughterhouse Five.

134
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:25,448
It's, it's a classic.

135
00:09:26,585 --> 00:09:28,712
Do you read much?

136
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:32,518
- In another town it's a classic.
- In any town.

137
00:09:32,591 --> 00:09:34,752
Tom Sawyer is a classic.

138
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:46,797
- That's fine.
- Ethel, have some more ham.

139
00:09:46,872 --> 00:09:49,534
You sure Ren doesn't want something?

140
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:51,633
We're both a little
tired from the move.

141
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,803
I'm gonna take Ren a potato.

142
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:58,248
Amy, come back and sit down.
I'm sure your cousin's fine.

143
00:09:58,317 --> 00:10:01,753
It's a shock to the system, moving
out here from the big city.

144
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,051
- What if he's starving?
- Amy, you are so lame.

145
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:07,649
Sarah! Amy, eat!

146
00:10:07,726 --> 00:10:10,559
I can't sit still!
I'm so excited you're both here!

147
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:12,824
You sure you're not too tired?

148
00:10:12,898 --> 00:10:14,832
No. Ren did most of the driving.

149
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,427
If you ask me, Ren is a total fox.

150
00:10:19,438 --> 00:10:21,372
Where did you hear that?

151
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,503
See how television and those kinds
of books influence children?

152
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:39,222
What the hell's the problem?

153
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:42,351
- Chuck Cranston, are you crazy?
- You're sick!

154
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:46,523
- Ariel, here's your sweater.
- Ariel, I could kill you!

155
00:10:46,598 --> 00:10:48,361
You almost did.

156
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:50,401
That's what you get for
sniffing spray starch.

157
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:53,404
After he graduated,
they drained his brain.

158
00:10:53,472 --> 00:10:56,305
- Edna, you gettin' fries?
- You can't have any.

159
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,206
Wendy Jo!

160
00:10:58,277 --> 00:10:59,505
Yes?

161
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:01,205
Bring me Edna's fries.

162
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,475
Oh, sure!

163
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:07,485
Where are you going?

164
00:11:08,654 --> 00:11:11,487
- What are you doing?
- Smuggled tapes.

165
00:11:11,557 --> 00:11:13,548
You be careful with that.

166
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,492
Your daddy hears you playin'
it, he'll bust your butt.

167
00:11:47,492 --> 00:11:51,189
He put his hands all over!

168
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:12,568
Your mother didn't think you
had any money with you.

169
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:34,322
Yeah, Mom?

170
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,333
You about ready to go?

171
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:38,335
You gonna wear that tie?

172
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:40,030
Yeah.

173
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:43,131
I think you might want
to dress down for now.

174
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,233
Why? I like the tie.

175
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,144
September, when you go to college,
you can dress like David Bowie.

176
00:13:49,214 --> 00:13:51,148
Come on, let's go.

177
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:43,427
Why don't you comb your hair?

178
00:14:43,504 --> 00:14:45,438
Shit, mister, where are you goin'?

179
00:14:45,506 --> 00:14:48,134
- You're supposed to look.
- Sorry.

180
00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:52,339
Where'd you learn how to drive?
Stay on the right side.

181
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:56,543
I like that hat. They sell men's
clothes where you got that?

182
00:14:57,785 --> 00:14:59,719
Willard, come on.

183
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:03,648
- What's your name?
- Ren.

184
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:06,693
My name's Willard. Hewitt.

185
00:15:06,761 --> 00:15:08,820
- Glad to meet ya.
- How ya doin'?

186
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:11,763
- All right. I'll see you around.
- All right.

187
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,825
I swear, one of these days...

188
00:15:18,773 --> 00:15:21,003
That tie is fabulous!

189
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:24,374
I mean it. It's fabulous.
Don't let anyone tell you any different.

190
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:32,416
Right?

191
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:34,250
Very good.

192
00:15:35,289 --> 00:15:37,553
Girl, you are on!

193
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:47,657
Chicago, wow, man.
Must be wild, like the Naked City.

194
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:49,396
Ah, fish.

195
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,667
I'll tell ya, you're gonna bounce
off the goddamn walls here.

196
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,674
What do you do there?

197
00:15:54,742 --> 00:15:57,973
Oh, I don't know. Same thing you do here.
What do you do here?

198
00:15:58,045 --> 00:15:59,979
- Lot of this.
- Yeah, that too.

199
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:05,714
I'll tell you, there was this
place called the Blue Heaven.

200
00:16:05,786 --> 00:16:09,745
It was great. Had to steal IDs to
get in, but it was incredible.

201
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:13,555
It was like a huge underground
circus, you know.

202
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:17,530
Hot pink neon climbin' up the walls.
And astro music.

203
00:16:17,598 --> 00:16:20,999
And millions of girls, like
from the university mostly.

204
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:25,064
If we could get one to dance,
just one, then that was it.

205
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,437
We'd get out on the floor and
we'd really start to smoke.

206
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:30,341
We'd start cuttin' in, and
these girls would stop.

207
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:33,778
- And they'd look.
- They'd look how?

208
00:16:33,848 --> 00:16:37,147
You know, they'd start to
warm up a little. Right?

209
00:16:37,218 --> 00:16:39,709
Pretty soon, they'd
start buying us beers.

210
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:42,017
- They're buying you guys beers?
- Oh, yeah.

211
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:43,522
Ah, shit.

212
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:45,855
Wait. There was this one.

213
00:16:47,828 --> 00:16:51,093
This was the best. Ginger.

214
00:16:51,165 --> 00:16:53,861
Listen. We started dancing, right?

215
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:57,166
Slow dancing, like we're
stuck to each other.

216
00:16:57,238 --> 00:17:00,537
Eventually it's obvious to me that
she wants to do more than dance.

217
00:17:00,608 --> 00:17:03,509
Right? So we left the place.

218
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:07,810
On the way to the car, she's
already got her tongue in my ear.

219
00:17:07,882 --> 00:17:09,816
We get to the car.

220
00:17:09,884 --> 00:17:12,648
She says we can't go to her place
'cause of her roommate, right?

221
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,018
But she says, "Hey, that's no problem."

222
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:20,288
She's got seats in the car that recline back.
All the way back.

223
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:23,296
- If you know what I'm saying.
- All the way?

224
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:25,798
Would I shit you? Right?

225
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:28,892
She rips my shirt open.
She's clawing my chest.

226
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,666
She's biting my neck, and I'm trying
to get over the stick shift...

227
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:33,832
'cause we're goin' like
a freight train now.

228
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:37,002
All of a sudden, she starts screaming
at the top of her lungs...

229
00:17:37,078 --> 00:17:41,879
"Oh, God! Oh, God! Don't stop!
Make Ginger pop!"

230
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:44,213
Oh, shit, really?

231
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:54,191
But we did dance.

232
00:17:54,262 --> 00:17:56,196
We danced our asses off.

233
00:17:56,264 --> 00:17:59,791
Willard, how could you let our
new student eat this food?

234
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:04,304
- Don't eat this.
- We have delicious homemade food.

235
00:18:04,372 --> 00:18:08,331
- Come on over.
- It's so good. Come on, Willard.

236
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:10,172
Oh, chicken!

237
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:14,704
Come on, come on. Good boy.
Bring your friend.

238
00:18:14,782 --> 00:18:17,444
- You won't get any of that here.
- What's that?

239
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:19,645
- Dancing. There's no dancing.
- That's right.

240
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,382
- Why?
- It's illegal.

241
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:23,923
Jump back!

242
00:18:23,991 --> 00:18:25,117
It's true.

243
00:18:25,192 --> 00:18:28,457
- Has been for five or six years.
- Why?

244
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:30,861
Go ahead, tell him.

245
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:33,627
It started when kids got
killed in a car wreck.

246
00:18:33,701 --> 00:18:38,638
Whole town went bananas, blaming it
on the music, liquor and dancing.

247
00:18:38,706 --> 00:18:41,698
Now they're just convinced
it's all a sin.

248
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:43,403
Who's convinced?

249
00:18:43,477 --> 00:18:45,775
Whole damn town.

250
00:18:51,952 --> 00:18:55,752
You really can't dance here, man?
I can't believe that.

251
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:59,418
It's true. This isn't the only place either.
You'd be surprised.

252
00:18:59,493 --> 00:19:01,654
Places upstate you can't dance.

253
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:05,495
Places in Kansas and Arkansas.
All over the place.

254
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:08,160
My cousin lives in Montana, and ya
can't dance where she lives either.

255
00:19:08,235 --> 00:19:10,726
Yeah? She ever get busted for bopping?

256
00:19:10,805 --> 00:19:12,739
I don't know. I never asked her.

257
00:19:14,709 --> 00:19:16,643
You rich?

258
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:18,702
No. Why?

259
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:21,145
'Cause I don't think I
ever bought a tape before.

260
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,844
Get serious! This place is too weird.

261
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:26,853
Don't you ever listen to the radio?

262
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:29,355
No. We got one radio at
home, but it's never on.

263
00:19:29,423 --> 00:19:31,357
- You like Men at Work?
- Which men?

264
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:33,484
- Men at Work.
- Where do they work?

265
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:36,394
- They're a music group.
- What do they call themselves?

266
00:19:36,464 --> 00:19:39,922
- Oh, no. What about the Police?
- What about 'em?

267
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,093
- Have you heard them?
- No, but I seen 'em.

268
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:44,694
- In concert?
- No, behind you.

269
00:19:44,772 --> 00:19:47,138
What? Oh, shit!

270
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,383
- Step out of the car.
- Could you tell me the problem?

271
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:02,445
Just step out of the car, please.

272
00:20:02,523 --> 00:20:05,686
- Jim, these plates are Illinois.
- So?

273
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,228
You got a license?

274
00:20:08,295 --> 00:20:09,728
Catch.

275
00:20:09,797 --> 00:20:13,028
Hey, I just bought that.

276
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,092
- Playing it kinda loud.
- There a law against loud music?

277
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,573
Watch that attitude, boy!
This way I don't have to take you in.

278
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:23,667
Twenty-five dollars.
They wouldn't even let me off with a warning.

279
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:26,736
You can't talk to our police the
way you talk to big city police.

280
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:29,112
- But I wasn't doing anything.
- Yeah, sure.

281
00:20:29,183 --> 00:20:30,673
Sarah, hush.

282
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:33,447
There was this bunch of kids
snuck over the state line...

283
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:35,489
to see some rock and roll group...

284
00:20:35,556 --> 00:20:39,219
and they were stopped on their way
back into town by the police.

285
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:41,591
They were on church and
school probation for weeks!

286
00:20:41,662 --> 00:20:45,530
You better watch your step
around here, young man.

287
00:21:07,054 --> 00:21:08,487
Daddy?

288
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:15,357
I'm sorry about the other night
at the drive-in, about the music.

289
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,464
I was surprised.

290
00:21:18,532 --> 00:21:20,227
Yeah.

291
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,948
I don't know what came over me.

292
00:21:35,015 --> 00:21:39,748
I can't always be with you.
I can't always look out for you.

293
00:21:49,663 --> 00:21:51,255
What's the music?

294
00:21:51,332 --> 00:21:55,701
Oh, it's... I think it's Haydn.
Chamber pieces.

295
00:21:57,805 --> 00:22:00,399
And that kind of music's okay?

296
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:05,309
It's uplifting. It doesn't confuse
people's minds and bodies.

297
00:22:08,282 --> 00:22:09,715
I don't...

298
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,246
What?

299
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:18,148
I see.

300
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:27,893
Tell your mother to go on to bed.
I still have a lot of work.

301
00:22:27,968 --> 00:22:29,401
I will.

302
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:36,169
What is it?

303
00:22:41,382 --> 00:22:44,078
- Good night.
- Good night, hon.

304
00:22:52,593 --> 00:22:54,527
Grab my books.

305
00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:56,529
Let me in.

306
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,960
How you doin'?

307
00:23:05,706 --> 00:23:08,300
You the new kid?

308
00:23:10,277 --> 00:23:13,872
I'm talking to you.
Where'd your tie go?

309
00:23:16,717 --> 00:23:19,550
I thought only pansies wore neckties.

310
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:25,024
Oh, yeah? See that?
I thought only assholes used the word pansy.

311
00:23:25,092 --> 00:23:27,754
- He got you on that one!
- Shut up!

312
00:23:27,828 --> 00:23:31,161
Son of a bitch is gonna pay for that!

313
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:36,703
Either you got jumbo coconut balls,
or you're really pretty stupid.

314
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,536
- Who was that douche bag?
- He's a weasel, but watch your back.

315
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:47,436
- Can you operate a palette jack?
- Uh-uh.

316
00:23:47,514 --> 00:23:49,948
- How 'bout a bag closer?
- Uh-uh.

317
00:23:50,017 --> 00:23:52,042
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.

318
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,053
You're not stupid, are you?

319
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:56,789
You trying to piss me off?

320
00:23:58,092 --> 00:24:01,425
Boy, a lot of folks are gonna
give you problems right off...

321
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:03,463
because you're an outsider.

322
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:06,431
You're dangerous.
They're always gonna worry about ya.

323
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,199
Screw 'em. And this is only one
little corner of the world.

324
00:24:14,308 --> 00:24:16,435
Start Thursday?

325
00:24:17,711 --> 00:24:19,144
Sounds okay.

326
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:45,438
Oh, hi, Ariel.

327
00:24:45,506 --> 00:24:47,440
Chuck Cranston wants to see you.

328
00:24:47,508 --> 00:24:50,477
Meet him the back of his
daddy's field tomorrow...

329
00:24:50,544 --> 00:24:52,341
5:30.

330
00:24:52,413 --> 00:24:55,246
What happens tomorrow at 5:30?

331
00:24:56,383 --> 00:25:00,513
- You'll have to show up to find out.
- And if I don't?

332
00:25:00,587 --> 00:25:04,353
People will know you're scared.

333
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:08,426
Anyway, Chuck will find you.

334
00:25:08,495 --> 00:25:10,827
You want that?

335
00:25:10,898 --> 00:25:12,365
You're backing up!

336
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:13,991
Hey, yo!

337
00:25:15,169 --> 00:25:17,729
How come he sent you?

338
00:25:17,805 --> 00:25:19,796
I volunteered.

339
00:25:19,873 --> 00:25:22,137
McCormack, where the hell are you?

340
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,643
You know her?

341
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:29,374
So she tells me...

342
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:33,318
that I pissed Chuck off, right?

343
00:25:33,387 --> 00:25:36,788
So he wants to see me.
Then she walks away.

344
00:25:36,857 --> 00:25:40,190
He figured you were gonna chicken and never...
Impressive.

345
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,864
Kinda out of it.

346
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:48,163
I had to go to work last year.

347
00:25:48,235 --> 00:25:50,169
You still move it.

348
00:25:50,237 --> 00:25:55,072
You better watch that. Ariel's gonna
tell her pop and you're gonna burn.

349
00:25:55,142 --> 00:25:59,203
What's her story?
Is she really tough or what?

350
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,339
She's just trying to make people
forget she's a preacher's kid.

351
00:26:04,651 --> 00:26:06,710
- That why she hangs out with Chuck?
- Maybe.

352
00:26:06,787 --> 00:26:10,416
- People think she's a hell-raiser.
- Is she?

353
00:26:10,491 --> 00:26:12,516
I think she's been kissed a lot.

354
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:22,095
You'd never guess your
daddy's a fire chief.

355
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:26,037
You'd never guess your daddy's
a minister. Red Boots.

356
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:29,132
My daddy hates me wearing these boots.

357
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:32,440
And you love that, don't you?

358
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:41,379
What are you gonna do when
I go away to college?

359
00:26:41,455 --> 00:26:43,446
Why do you wanna do that, honey?

360
00:26:43,524 --> 00:26:47,358
Just 'cause. I'm cut out for
more than this small town.

361
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:50,656
You're as small town as they come.

362
00:27:03,443 --> 00:27:06,435
A chicken race with tractors?

363
00:27:08,048 --> 00:27:10,778
- How hard could it be?
- Just like a car. It's easy.

364
00:27:10,851 --> 00:27:14,287
Just like driving a sports car.
Nothing could be simpler.

365
00:27:14,354 --> 00:27:16,982
Oh, hell, Ren, just
remember to stay calm.

366
00:27:17,057 --> 00:27:20,322
Calm? I've never driven
a tractor before.

367
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:25,491
It's easy. Look.
This is your clutch, your gas, your brake.

368
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:28,160
You start off, you just
shift it into high.

369
00:27:28,235 --> 00:27:30,328
Don't worry about your one, two, three, four.
Just put it into third.

370
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:33,567
Once you get going,
slam it into fourth.

371
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,076
That's your emergency brake.
These operate your bucket.

372
00:27:37,144 --> 00:27:41,012
I'll bet he's scared shitless,
and he turns out in ten seconds.

373
00:27:44,384 --> 00:27:47,148
Chuck, you sure you're up to this?

374
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:49,212
Whose side are you on anyway, honey?

375
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:51,223
You had a lot to smoke.

376
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:53,350
Don't tell me I had enough to smoke.

377
00:27:53,427 --> 00:27:56,396
I didn't say you had enough.
I said you had a lot to smoke.

378
00:27:56,463 --> 00:27:58,488
Don't tell me that either!

379
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:03,625
Why don't you go tell dog-face
we're ready to go! Yeah!

380
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,478
Just remember he's chicken shit.
Hang in there. You'll be great!

381
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:19,542
- Just hope to God he pulls out.
- I don't wanna split his face open.

382
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,783
- Cool it, Tarzan!
- Give him hell, Ren!

383
00:28:24,157 --> 00:28:27,058
How did I get myself into this?

384
00:28:27,127 --> 00:28:29,789
Hey, Woody, come here.

385
00:28:31,131 --> 00:28:35,500
Listen, has anybody
ever died doing this?

386
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:37,730
Just once.

387
00:28:37,804 --> 00:28:39,999
Hey, Ren! Hey, sport!

388
00:28:40,073 --> 00:28:44,373
When this hat flies in the air, you
better have your butt in gear.

389
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:28,280
- Come on, Ren!
- Go! Go!

390
00:29:40,313 --> 00:29:42,804
Let's see what you're made of!

391
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:48,378
Come on, sucker!

392
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:53,349
Chuck, move it!

393
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:04,299
You wanna go up, huh?

394
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,803
There you go.

395
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,907
Oh, you wanna go down.

396
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:17,081
Kick his ass!

397
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:27,919
That's it! Jump, you chicken!

398
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:29,552
Sit down!

399
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:42,900
What are you doing? Trying to kill me?

400
00:30:42,976 --> 00:30:44,944
You stupid idiot!

401
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:46,603
Get off!

402
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,203
Turn out!

403
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,249
Oh, shit!

404
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:21,837
Help! He tried to kill me.

405
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:36,261
Excuse me. Thank you.

406
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:41,023
I don't believe this town.

407
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:44,469
Hello.

408
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:47,400
Tell me.

409
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,873
He has team practice
every day until 4:00.

410
00:31:49,943 --> 00:31:54,004
Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays
he's at the Beamis Mill till 6:00.

411
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,708
You already knew that.

412
00:31:56,783 --> 00:31:59,308
He hasn't dated since
he's been in town.

413
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:04,220
And late Friday nights, by the
light of the full moon...

414
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:08,624
he breaks into churchyards and
bites the heads off live chickens.

415
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:15,124
Come on, what is it? Chuck?

416
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:18,068
I never did think he had all
his dogs barking anyway.

417
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:21,834
Besides, what is wrong about
getting a little psyched over Ren?

418
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:23,967
He's cute. He's from out of town.

419
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:26,568
Don't tell me that doesn't curl your toes.
I know you too well.

420
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:30,174
You want out of here so bad, you
probably memorize bus schedules.

421
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:32,012
And you don't?

422
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:50,961
Hey, asshole.

423
00:32:51,037 --> 00:32:53,005
Interested in some really good shit?

424
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:56,064
Rich, you sly little shit.
You just made a whole sentence.

425
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,906
Don't get smart-ass!

426
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:03,347
I've been watching you.
I know you're not stupid.

427
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:06,613
And I got a friend here who can
help you out from time to time.

428
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:10,645
No, thanks. I got my own sources.
I'm getting into hog tranquilizers...

429
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:13,954
We'll just call this a sample, and
you know where you can get more.

430
00:33:14,027 --> 00:33:18,361
- Rich, I don't want your shit.
- Why don't I just take it?

431
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:20,922
You're taking chances
being new in this school.

432
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,195
I gotta show you something.
Wait! This is tea!

433
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:33,275
Would I do that with a real joint?
You know what an ounce goes for?

434
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:36,607
I'm gonna get you.

435
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:39,584
You wait.

436
00:33:40,653 --> 00:33:43,144
The Reverend was right about you.

437
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:56,727
A bunch of kids was raising hell
at Burlington Cranston's property.

438
00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:59,897
Tore up the fields,
turned over a tractor.

439
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:03,836
Today someone suggested
to me there's been...

440
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,970
some trouble at the high
school, I think it was drugs.

441
00:34:08,114 --> 00:34:13,017
You wouldn't know about that?
What did you say? I can't hear you.

442
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:15,350
- He said, "No."
- Amy.

443
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:17,981
I said, "No, sir."

444
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:22,221
You know, whenever we used to
call your folks in Chicago...

445
00:34:22,295 --> 00:34:24,422
I don't think there was
any trouble, was there?

446
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:31,370
I don't know what to make of it.

447
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:36,397
- People are pointing your direction.
- What did they say?

448
00:34:36,476 --> 00:34:41,004
What I've been telling you
about the trouble and drugs.

449
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,141
You seem to be having trouble since
you moved here. And I figured...

450
00:34:45,218 --> 00:34:47,846
You figured where there's
smoke, there's fire, right?

451
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,888
Usually works like that.

452
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:55,156
Look, you know I would never try
to take the place of your father.

453
00:34:55,228 --> 00:34:58,163
Well, there's no chance of that.

454
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:08,369
Uh-oh, he's taking the car.

455
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:08,483
Big time!

456
00:38:11,023 --> 00:38:13,082
What are you doing here?

457
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,751
Watching.

458
00:38:14,827 --> 00:38:17,227
I thought I was alone.

459
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:21,289
Not in this town.
There's eyes everywhere.

460
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:30,106
- How come you don't like me?
- What makes you think I don't?

461
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:34,078
You never talk to me at school.
You never look at me.

462
00:38:36,048 --> 00:38:40,451
Maybe because if I did, your
boyfriend would remove my lungs.

463
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,145
Chuck Cranston doesn't own me.

464
00:38:44,223 --> 00:38:47,056
He likes to act like he
does, but he doesn't.

465
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:53,056
Do you wanna kiss me?

466
00:38:53,866 --> 00:38:55,891
Someday.

467
00:38:57,937 --> 00:39:00,235
What is this someday shit?

468
00:39:02,241 --> 00:39:04,573
I get the feeling you've
been kissed a lot.

469
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:07,737
I'm afraid I'd suffer by comparison.

470
00:39:13,586 --> 00:39:15,747
You don't think much of me, do you?

471
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:19,950
You think I'm small town?

472
00:39:22,395 --> 00:39:24,329
I think Bomont's a small town.

473
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:28,661
I'm going away.

474
00:39:29,902 --> 00:39:32,234
I've already applied to colleges.

475
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:35,967
I applied to colleges my father
doesn't know I applied to.

476
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,602
He's gonna come after me,
but I'm gonna be gone.

477
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:57,989
Wanna see something?

478
00:40:00,266 --> 00:40:01,858
Sure.

479
00:40:06,105 --> 00:40:08,835
We call it "The Yearbook."

480
00:40:08,908 --> 00:40:12,742
It started four or five
years ago, I guess.

481
00:40:12,812 --> 00:40:14,973
It's stuff we're not supposed to read.

482
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,555
This is all out of books?

483
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:27,456
Most of it. Some songs, magazines.

484
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:31,187
Some poems that get made up.

485
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:39,900
"I'll sing to you of silver swans,
of kingdoms and carillons."

486
00:40:39,972 --> 00:40:43,999
"I'll sing of bodies intertwined
underneath an innocent sky."

487
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:47,779
You wrote that?

488
00:40:47,847 --> 00:40:50,247
It's not even one of my best.

489
00:40:50,316 --> 00:40:52,011
It's all right.

490
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:02,126
Wait a minute. You hear that?

491
00:41:02,194 --> 00:41:04,185
- What?
- The train. You hear it?

492
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:11,230
Sometimes after football
games we come out here.

493
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:14,932
Just a few of us. And we stand here.

494
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:18,704
Then when the train comes,
we make out like crazy.

495
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:21,345
Oh, yeah?

496
00:41:23,649 --> 00:41:26,345
Most of the time we
just stand and scream.

497
00:41:26,418 --> 00:41:27,908
Scream?

498
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:30,956
Yeah. I saw it in a movie.
Real loud from here.

499
00:41:43,202 --> 00:41:45,136
Don't screw around.

500
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:43,360
Come on.

501
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:48,065
Come on, I'll take you home.

502
00:43:03,716 --> 00:43:07,652
- It's late.
- Yeah.

503
00:43:10,122 --> 00:43:13,956
It's hard to impose a curfew on the
young people in my congregation...

504
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:17,621
that I can't even
enforce in my own home.

505
00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:25,566
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

506
00:43:25,638 --> 00:43:28,038
- Were you smoking something?
- No!

507
00:43:29,308 --> 00:43:31,572
I wasn't stealing, gambling, dancing...

508
00:43:31,644 --> 00:43:34,204
or reading books I'm not supposed to.

509
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,010
I am late!

510
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:39,141
Who were you with?

511
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:41,584
Ren McCormack.

512
00:43:41,654 --> 00:43:45,215
- I don't want you to see him.
- Why?

513
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:47,191
I've heard he's a troublemaker.

514
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:49,523
Just 'cause he hasn't lived
in this town for 20 years...

515
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:51,529
doesn't make him a troublemaker!

516
00:43:51,597 --> 00:43:54,964
I don't know what I'm
gonna do with you.

517
00:43:55,034 --> 00:43:57,366
There ain't nothing
to do with me, Daddy.

518
00:43:57,436 --> 00:44:01,951
Like it or not, this is it.
It doesn't get much better.

519
00:44:17,467 --> 00:44:21,164
What the hell happened?
Why'd you get kicked off the team?

520
00:44:21,237 --> 00:44:23,171
Because somebody's got it in for me.

521
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:27,005
Coach found out I brought Ariel
home late, so I'm a troublemaker.

522
00:44:27,076 --> 00:44:31,012
That's not why I'm off the team.
No, no.

523
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,517
I'm off’ cause they don't have funds
for one more gymnast, but thank you.

524
00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:39,544
I'm busting my balls trying to fit
in and every door slams in my face.

525
00:44:39,622 --> 00:44:42,716
Hey, McCormack!
Sorry to hear you got caught.

526
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:44,760
Don't fool around with
the preacher's daughter!

527
00:44:44,828 --> 00:44:47,058
How does anybody live in this town?

528
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:49,826
You know what it is?
You got an attitude problem.

529
00:44:49,899 --> 00:44:54,199
- I got an attitude problem?
- I'm not the only one who's noticed.

530
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:58,331
We're not living in the goddamn Middle Ages.
We got TV, Family Feud.

531
00:44:58,408 --> 00:45:01,707
We're not stuck in Leave
It to Beaver land here.

532
00:45:01,778 --> 00:45:06,442
Well, I haven't noticed a wet
T-shirt contest in town yet.

533
00:45:07,484 --> 00:45:11,545
I haven't either, but
I'm waiting patiently.

534
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:13,555
I tell you what I'd like to do.

535
00:45:13,623 --> 00:45:17,787
Glue a Playboy centerfold inside
each of Reverend Moore's hymnals.

536
00:45:17,861 --> 00:45:19,829
Yeah, you know what else we could do?

537
00:45:19,896 --> 00:45:23,423
We could start one of your
nightclubs right in the church.

538
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:28,134
That's it. That's it, man.

539
00:45:29,205 --> 00:45:30,467
What's it?

540
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,700
A dance.

541
00:45:32,742 --> 00:45:34,209
- What?
- A dance!

542
00:45:34,277 --> 00:45:37,644
We could have a dance!
You know, a dance?

543
00:45:37,714 --> 00:45:41,047
- You know what I mean! Dance! Dance!
- You're gonna get me angry!

544
00:45:41,117 --> 00:45:43,381
Gonna turn this town upside down!

545
00:45:43,453 --> 00:45:44,886
Stop it!

546
00:45:49,659 --> 00:45:52,492
I was down in Denver last year...

547
00:45:52,562 --> 00:45:55,827
for about a week at a Bible convention.

548
00:45:55,899 --> 00:45:58,834
And the whole time I was there,
people would come up...

549
00:45:58,902 --> 00:46:03,669
and ask me, "Reverend, how can you
live in such a small town..."

550
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:07,801
so far away from the hustle and
bustle of the 20th century?"

551
00:46:07,877 --> 00:46:11,142
I'd say to them, "You'd
never ask me that..."

552
00:46:11,214 --> 00:46:13,944
if you could just once,
just for one minute...

553
00:46:14,017 --> 00:46:19,080
experience the feeling of family
that comes from knowing...

554
00:46:19,155 --> 00:46:22,090
that all of our lives are
tied up with each of us.

555
00:46:23,092 --> 00:46:25,117
That we feel all the same joys...

556
00:46:25,194 --> 00:46:30,131
the same sorrows, and that we care.

557
00:46:31,334 --> 00:46:33,802
"Each and every one of
us cares for the other."

558
00:46:35,271 --> 00:46:36,602
I told them...

559
00:46:36,673 --> 00:46:40,040
"I just feel closer to
my Lord out there."

560
00:46:40,109 --> 00:46:43,806
And I feel closer...

561
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,872
and safer with my people...

562
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:49,544
and I think they feel closer to me.

563
00:46:50,887 --> 00:46:54,323
The Lord smiles on us out there.

564
00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:57,855
"And that's why I'm staying."

565
00:46:59,996 --> 00:47:01,861
Why don't you have some cake?

566
00:47:06,936 --> 00:47:10,235
Roger, the town council has
no intention of bowing...

567
00:47:10,306 --> 00:47:12,240
to wishes of a small group of students.

568
00:47:12,308 --> 00:47:17,644
Eleanor and I are absolutely certain
that this boy is organizing a dance.

569
00:47:17,714 --> 00:47:20,478
- We're not gonna have any dance.
- We let some punk push us around...

570
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:24,646
it won't be long before every
community standard is violated.

571
00:47:24,721 --> 00:47:26,689
- Boy, are they in a tizzy!
- Ariel, get in the car!

572
00:47:26,756 --> 00:47:29,657
- Got the whole council going!
- There's a meeting I won't miss.

573
00:47:29,726 --> 00:47:31,660
- Where are you taking us?
- Over the state line.

574
00:47:31,728 --> 00:47:33,696
I want you to see what
you've been missing.

575
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:35,890
I know you're not gonna
let Willard fight, right?

576
00:47:35,965 --> 00:47:40,368
- I don't fight.
- Right, and I don't breathe.

577
00:48:02,992 --> 00:48:06,120
- Are you gonna dance?
- I drink better than I dance.

578
00:48:06,195 --> 00:48:07,958
Come on!

579
00:48:08,031 --> 00:48:10,761
I'll watch you guys, see if you
can show me something new.

580
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:14,064
We didn't come all this
way just to sit it out.

581
00:48:14,137 --> 00:48:18,631
I'll be out there. Don't worry.
I'm just gonna grab a beer.

582
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:22,405
Come on, don't be an asshole!
They're waiting to dance with us.

583
00:48:25,515 --> 00:48:27,745
I can't dance.

584
00:48:27,817 --> 00:48:29,478
You what?

585
00:48:29,552 --> 00:48:31,782
I can't dance.

586
00:48:32,855 --> 00:48:34,982
At all.

587
00:48:37,293 --> 00:48:39,591
All right. All right.

588
00:48:42,565 --> 00:48:45,261
- Buy him a beer.
- Take my jacket.

589
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:58,813
- What's the matter?
- My feet have been hurting.

590
00:48:58,881 --> 00:49:00,974
They weren't hurting in the car.
I wanna dance.

591
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:02,984
I wanna get a beer.

592
00:49:52,368 --> 00:49:54,495
Waitress, let me have another beer.

593
00:50:47,757 --> 00:50:50,692
I can't help myself!

594
00:52:07,737 --> 00:52:10,535
Hey, I came with that girl.

595
00:52:10,606 --> 00:52:13,200
Doesn't look like you're
leaving with her.

596
00:52:15,978 --> 00:52:18,674
Hey, I guess you didn't
hear me the first time.

597
00:52:18,748 --> 00:52:22,275
- No fights. You don't even know him.
- Why don't you flake off?

598
00:52:24,687 --> 00:52:26,484
No fights.

599
00:52:26,555 --> 00:52:30,286
When was the last time you
seen your dick, partner?

600
00:52:37,266 --> 00:52:39,860
Rusty, he was fighting
to save your honor.

601
00:52:39,936 --> 00:52:42,905
- It's too late.
- I don't fight.

602
00:52:42,972 --> 00:52:45,532
- Your dance gonna be like this one?
- Everything but the fight.

603
00:52:45,608 --> 00:52:47,041
Forget it.

604
00:52:47,109 --> 00:52:48,804
Ow! Come on!

605
00:52:50,479 --> 00:52:52,777
Up on the roof, oh, yeah.

606
00:52:52,848 --> 00:52:54,873
One hundred proof, oh, yea.

607
00:52:54,951 --> 00:52:57,112
Ain't that fine, oh, yeah.

608
00:52:57,186 --> 00:52:59,279
You cherry slime, oh, yeah.

609
00:53:01,757 --> 00:53:02,985
Oh, what?

610
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:04,788
Oh, yea.

611
00:53:11,901 --> 00:53:14,267
I hate this bridge.
Gives me the creeps.

612
00:53:15,137 --> 00:53:16,570
How come?

613
00:53:18,441 --> 00:53:23,071
You've heard this one.
The infamous Crosby Bridge accident.

614
00:53:23,145 --> 00:53:26,046
- You've heard it.
- No.

615
00:53:26,115 --> 00:53:29,380
You're missing out!
'Bout five years ago...

616
00:53:29,452 --> 00:53:33,388
these kids were playing highway
tag and they were drunk.

617
00:53:33,456 --> 00:53:38,086
One car hits the other one, and
they both go over the bridge. Dead.

618
00:53:40,363 --> 00:53:42,763
That's when they started
passing laws against booze...

619
00:53:42,832 --> 00:53:45,232
against dancing and drinking.

620
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:47,599
I don't know.

621
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:50,969
My father had a field day.

622
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,032
Your father? Why?

623
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:56,408
My older brother was
one who got killed.

624
00:53:57,813 --> 00:53:59,747
You should've seen Bobby.

625
00:53:59,815 --> 00:54:02,375
He was like Warren Beatty, only taller.
Wasn't he?

626
00:54:04,653 --> 00:54:06,746
My father went off the deep end.

627
00:54:06,822 --> 00:54:09,985
He decided we all needed
saving, no matter what.

628
00:54:10,059 --> 00:54:14,086
He's gonna personally save this
this pissant town and deliver it...

629
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:17,132
to heaven with his daughter sitting
like a cherry on top of it.

630
00:54:41,524 --> 00:54:43,583
I called over to Rusty's last night.

631
00:54:49,799 --> 00:54:52,290
I don't understand why you feel
it necessary to lie to me.

632
00:54:53,536 --> 00:54:55,970
I don't know why you find it
necessary to check up on me.

633
00:54:56,038 --> 00:54:58,973
I'm concerned about your
well-being, that's all.

634
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:01,976
How come when I'm home you're never
as interested in what I do or say...

635
00:55:02,044 --> 00:55:04,376
as you are when I walk out that door?

636
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,347
Wham! Suddenly you
wanna know everything!

637
00:55:06,415 --> 00:55:08,542
I don't like this outburst...

638
00:55:08,617 --> 00:55:12,053
any more than I like not
knowing where you were!

639
00:55:12,121 --> 00:55:14,282
Shaw, don't you think
we could wait on this?

640
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:18,190
No, I don't. I'm sick and tired
of you coming in on her side!

641
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:20,524
She'll have to start
answering for herself.

642
00:55:20,596 --> 00:55:24,032
I don't know why. You don't listen
to me any more than you do her.

643
00:55:50,059 --> 00:55:52,721
I've never hit anyone in my life.

644
00:55:56,966 --> 00:55:58,957
We're losing her, Vi.

645
00:56:00,536 --> 00:56:03,369
- Don't you see that?
- No.

646
00:56:03,439 --> 00:56:08,376
I see you chasing after her, and
I see her running from you.

647
00:56:08,444 --> 00:56:12,847
She's become so willful and obstinate.

648
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:16,577
She's like her father.

649
00:56:18,454 --> 00:56:22,618
The two of you were so wonderful once.

650
00:56:22,691 --> 00:56:26,889
You had so much to talk about.

651
00:56:26,962 --> 00:56:29,192
I was almost jealous.

652
00:56:34,503 --> 00:56:36,767
It's not as if we don't talk.

653
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,001
It's just that...

654
00:56:41,577 --> 00:56:44,512
sometimes people run
out of things to say.

655
00:56:58,027 --> 00:56:59,324
Shaw?

656
00:57:02,865 --> 00:57:05,698
It's 20 years now I've
been a minister's wife.

657
00:57:07,336 --> 00:57:12,467
And I've been quiet,
supportive, unobtrusive and...

658
00:57:14,343 --> 00:57:18,803
after 20 years I still think
you're a wonderful preacher.

659
00:57:20,249 --> 00:57:22,217
You can lift a
congregation up so high...

660
00:57:22,284 --> 00:57:24,343
they have to look down to see heaven.

661
00:57:29,391 --> 00:57:32,918
But it's the one-to-one where
you need a little work.

662
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,471
- We could really use your support.
- My mother wouldn't approve.

663
00:57:47,543 --> 00:57:49,875
But we're not talking
about a free-for-all.

664
00:57:49,945 --> 00:57:53,506
It won't be a drunken brawl.
It's just a dance.

665
00:57:53,582 --> 00:57:57,450
Just give it some thought.
Okay? Sleep on it.

666
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:00,579
Just think about it.
Okay, thanks. See you later.

667
00:58:00,656 --> 00:58:03,022
Sounds great to me.

668
00:58:03,092 --> 00:58:05,526
How you doin'?
Need any help, just let me know.

669
00:58:05,594 --> 00:58:08,188
You got it.

670
00:58:08,264 --> 00:58:10,892
Chuck has heard something
that's upset him real good.

671
00:58:10,966 --> 00:58:15,198
I want you to tell me it ain't so, Mr.
Chicago Big Shot.

672
00:58:15,271 --> 00:58:19,640
He heard you're gonna try and throw
a dance at school. A senior dance.

673
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:22,531
And he figured only a dumb
sonbitch faggot would try that.

674
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:23,576
Is that what you're trying?

675
00:58:23,646 --> 00:58:25,580
He sure the hell is!

676
00:58:27,383 --> 00:58:29,408
Excuse me, girls. Come out, Ren.

677
00:58:29,485 --> 00:58:31,385
You guys stay right there.

678
00:58:31,453 --> 00:58:33,648
Is he really gonna get us a dance?

679
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:35,656
Yep. Ain't ya?

680
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:39,025
- It's about time, McCormack.
- I'll be there.

681
00:58:39,094 --> 00:58:40,425
Thanks.

682
00:58:41,664 --> 00:58:44,452
Don't you have any better manners?
Didn't your mama teach you better?

683
00:58:44,586 --> 00:58:46,577
You treat animals like that?

684
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:49,647
How's it feel?
Don't feel too good now, does it?

685
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:52,919
- What are you talking about?
- You'll have to fight city hall.

686
00:58:52,994 --> 00:58:54,928
What do you mean I
gotta fight city hall?

687
00:58:54,996 --> 00:58:57,794
'Cause there's a town council.

688
00:59:00,368 --> 00:59:02,495
It's made up of seven people.

689
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:06,529
Shaw Moore's one of 'em.
Burlington Cranston is another.

690
00:59:06,608 --> 00:59:09,805
Personally, I don't like
that lousy son of a bitch.

691
00:59:09,878 --> 00:59:12,403
They meet every third
Thursday of the month.

692
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,278
Something you want in this town,
you'll have to talk to them.

693
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:18,046
You're gonna get really creamed.

694
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:21,088
Geez. I'm not so good with words.

695
00:59:21,156 --> 00:59:24,785
Keep thinking like that, man,
and you are gonna get creamed.

696
00:59:24,859 --> 00:59:27,953
Woody doesn't know a
dance from a dipstick.

697
00:59:29,297 --> 00:59:32,528
And you do? You do, huh?
Which way is your left?

698
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,034
Huh? Willard, which way is your left?

699
00:59:35,103 --> 00:59:37,731
He don't know his left
foot from his right foot.

700
00:59:37,806 --> 00:59:41,105
I'll tell you something.
If I gotta get up in front of that council...

701
00:59:41,176 --> 00:59:43,110
you gotta learn to dance.

702
01:03:01,242 --> 01:03:04,143
What is this, Roger?
I don't know this book.

703
01:03:04,212 --> 01:03:05,645
I hope you wouldn't.

704
01:03:05,713 --> 01:03:10,013
Reverend Moore, Mrs.
Evans is calling about that dance at school.

705
01:03:10,084 --> 01:03:12,848
Would you tell her I'll call
her back after Junior Bible?

706
01:03:12,921 --> 01:03:14,445
What were you saying?

707
01:03:14,522 --> 01:03:17,457
This was found in one of the
athletic lockers at school.

708
01:03:17,525 --> 01:03:19,459
A book like this should be burned.

709
01:03:19,527 --> 01:03:22,587
We should go to the library
and remove this corruption.

710
01:03:22,664 --> 01:03:25,997
There's no sense blowing it up
into something that it isn't.

711
01:03:26,067 --> 01:03:27,728
Hello! Careful.

712
01:03:29,003 --> 01:03:31,130
Come on, Max.

713
01:03:31,206 --> 01:03:32,867
I'll set up, Vi.

714
01:03:32,941 --> 01:03:35,205
I think it's quite obvious what it is.

715
01:03:35,276 --> 01:03:38,336
It's not quite so obvious
how I should handle it.

716
01:03:38,413 --> 01:03:41,507
Reverend, if you'll
excuse my saying so...

717
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:43,813
when we got rid of that young
English teacher at the school...

718
01:03:43,885 --> 01:03:46,911
we didn't get any support from you.

719
01:03:46,988 --> 01:03:49,957
Because I didn't think we had
any grounds for his dismissal.

720
01:03:50,024 --> 01:03:53,050
Around here, it caused a
lot of folks some worry.

721
01:03:53,127 --> 01:03:55,527
A lot of folks worry a little too much.

722
01:03:56,497 --> 01:03:58,727
Doesn't take much time for
corruption to take root.

723
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,768
How long is that, Roger?

724
01:04:00,835 --> 01:04:03,702
About as long as it takes
compassion to die?

725
01:04:05,139 --> 01:04:08,666
- Do I get a cookie?
- No!

726
01:04:08,743 --> 01:04:13,009
- Did you drink all the milk?
- Yeah!

727
01:04:41,943 --> 01:04:44,275
- I wanted to talk to you.
- You don't have to tell me nothin'.

728
01:04:44,345 --> 01:04:46,279
I know why you don't call me.

729
01:04:47,181 --> 01:04:49,411
I wanted to tell you myself.

730
01:04:49,484 --> 01:04:51,679
I know why you don't
want to see me anymore.

731
01:04:51,753 --> 01:04:53,846
I'm not stupid!

732
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:57,353
I'm not blind.

733
01:04:58,359 --> 01:05:00,691
It's McCormack, ain't it?

734
01:05:00,762 --> 01:05:05,290
You're just dying to screw
McCormack, aren't you? Aren't you?

735
01:05:05,366 --> 01:05:07,391
You're so stupid!

736
01:05:07,468 --> 01:05:08,958
Stupid?

737
01:05:09,037 --> 01:05:11,972
Think I don't see you looking
at him like some bitch in heat?

738
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,974
You'll wrap those skinny
legs around anybody.

739
01:05:14,042 --> 01:05:15,100
Shut up!

740
01:05:16,811 --> 01:05:19,405
Is that what I get? Huh?

741
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,311
I treated you decent!

742
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:24,383
Shit.

743
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:38,826
Put that down!
Don't even think about that.

744
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:41,266
- Jesus!
- You think about it!

745
01:05:50,478 --> 01:05:52,537
Stop it, Chuck!

746
01:06:08,596 --> 01:06:11,030
'Bout through with you anyway.

747
01:06:24,412 --> 01:06:27,779
I'm sorry you have to see me like this.

748
01:06:27,849 --> 01:06:31,012
I'll be okay. I'll sneak in at home.
I'll be fine.

749
01:06:31,085 --> 01:06:34,020
- Do I look okay?
- You'll pull through.

750
01:06:39,293 --> 01:06:41,557
Thanks for coming for me.

751
01:06:43,431 --> 01:06:45,365
I don't understand.

752
01:06:45,433 --> 01:06:47,867
There's nothing to understand.

753
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:50,631
It's for taking on my father.

754
01:06:50,705 --> 01:06:54,607
Wait a minute. I got no beef with him.

755
01:06:54,675 --> 01:06:58,907
No, wait. This is my fight, it's
with the town, not with one guy.

756
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:03,349
You don't get to turn my fight into
a "screw you" to your old man.

757
01:07:12,994 --> 01:07:14,427
Hey, look...

758
01:07:17,298 --> 01:07:19,061
maybe...

759
01:07:21,602 --> 01:07:25,129
Maybe you shouldn't try so
hard to forget your brother...

760
01:07:26,941 --> 01:07:29,671
or to try to make your
father forget him, you know?

761
01:07:33,948 --> 01:07:36,781
- It's not that easy.
- I know.

762
01:07:38,953 --> 01:07:40,921
Do I still get the box?

763
01:07:41,823 --> 01:07:43,757
Gimme the box.

764
01:07:59,307 --> 01:08:00,740
Nice.

765
01:08:09,717 --> 01:08:11,651
Think you might ever kiss me?

766
01:08:57,665 --> 01:09:00,225
Harvey and Bernie were
here for a long time.

767
01:09:01,769 --> 01:09:03,703
They still talking about that dance?

768
01:09:03,771 --> 01:09:05,204
Yeah.

769
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:13,268
- What did you decide to do?
- It's not gonna happen.

770
01:09:15,349 --> 01:09:19,615
That's one more thing Ariel is not
going to forgive me for, but...

771
01:09:21,656 --> 01:09:25,592
Can you step out of the way enough
to realize she's doing this for you?

772
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,093
Me?

773
01:09:28,763 --> 01:09:30,993
I don't see that.

774
01:09:31,065 --> 01:09:32,999
I just know that when
kids dance together...

775
01:09:33,067 --> 01:09:36,036
they become sexually irresponsible.

776
01:09:36,103 --> 01:09:38,162
I can't take the chance...

777
01:09:40,107 --> 01:09:42,041
What's so funny?

778
01:09:44,045 --> 01:09:47,742
You talk like that's the only
thing that gets them excited.

779
01:09:48,649 --> 01:09:52,380
Don't you remember when we used to
look at each other and get excited?

780
01:09:55,423 --> 01:09:57,357
It's just the same with them.

781
01:09:58,859 --> 01:10:00,986
You're not gonna put their eyes out.

782
01:10:18,512 --> 01:10:21,310
None of this is gonna
undo one stupid accident.

783
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:25,719
I'm responsible for the spiritual
life of this community.

784
01:10:28,055 --> 01:10:31,491
Shaw, you can't be a
father to everybody.

785
01:10:31,559 --> 01:10:33,550
You can't do that.

786
01:10:36,797 --> 01:10:39,231
I thought that at least
you believed in me.

787
01:10:51,212 --> 01:10:53,146
I never stopped.

788
01:10:56,017 --> 01:10:58,645
Be at the town council
meeting tomorrow night.

789
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:00,152
Only fairies dance.

790
01:11:01,622 --> 01:11:03,556
I'll lay you flat, Ariel.

791
01:11:03,624 --> 01:11:07,253
Support Ren McCormack at the
council meeting tomorrow night.

792
01:11:07,328 --> 01:11:09,353
You can make a difference!

793
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:13,730
I'm calling to remind you to come
to the town council meeting.

794
01:11:18,406 --> 01:11:20,306
Hi.

795
01:11:20,374 --> 01:11:22,399
- Still hurt?
- Naw.

796
01:11:22,476 --> 01:11:24,444
Good.

797
01:11:24,512 --> 01:11:26,480
- Nervous?
- No. Uh-uh.

798
01:11:27,448 --> 01:11:28,881
Look, I...

799
01:11:30,151 --> 01:11:31,948
Yeah.

800
01:11:32,019 --> 01:11:33,953
Yeah, I'm nervous.

801
01:11:34,021 --> 01:11:37,479
I don't know what I'm
gonna say to the council.

802
01:11:37,558 --> 01:11:40,186
There's only seven of them, right?

803
01:11:41,829 --> 01:11:44,764
- Who else is gonna be there?
- Everybody.

804
01:11:46,167 --> 01:11:48,692
Take a deep breath. You ready?

805
01:11:53,574 --> 01:11:56,805
What is it? The Holy Bible?

806
01:12:03,217 --> 01:12:05,208
Ah, this is great.

807
01:12:07,354 --> 01:12:09,822
This is great! What...

808
01:12:11,392 --> 01:12:13,792
How'd you know where to find all this?

809
01:12:13,861 --> 01:12:15,294
Are you kidding?

810
01:12:20,835 --> 01:12:23,133
I wanna tell you something.

811
01:12:23,204 --> 01:12:24,637
Thanks.

812
01:12:34,915 --> 01:12:36,348
Come on.

813
01:12:43,057 --> 01:12:44,991
What the hell is that?

814
01:12:47,895 --> 01:12:50,261
- Oh, my God!
- Amy? What is it?

815
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:54,594
"Burn in hell"?
This says, "Burn in hell."

816
01:12:57,037 --> 01:13:00,564
- Ren, what the hell is going on?
- Somebody's trying to make a point.

817
01:13:00,641 --> 01:13:02,199
Do you see now?

818
01:13:02,276 --> 01:13:05,268
You don't wave flags here without
people taking shots at them.

819
01:13:05,346 --> 01:13:07,371
This is not the first time.

820
01:13:07,448 --> 01:13:11,214
My business was off, but people
are taking business away from me.

821
01:13:11,285 --> 01:13:15,745
Your aunt's gotten ugly phone calls
and today your mother lost her job.

822
01:13:15,823 --> 01:13:17,256
Mom, is that true?

823
01:13:18,859 --> 01:13:20,884
Mr. Collins said he
heard things about you.

824
01:13:20,961 --> 01:13:23,020
He thought I ought to stay
home and be a proper mother.

825
01:13:23,097 --> 01:13:25,361
- What did you say?
- I told him to shove it.

826
01:13:25,432 --> 01:13:27,366
Damn it, Ethel, this is serious.

827
01:13:27,434 --> 01:13:29,299
- There's other jobs!
- Where?

828
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:32,396
- Shouldn't you call the police?
- I don't know if it'll do any good.

829
01:13:32,473 --> 01:13:35,135
I'll get Jim Earlhaus over here.
Will you stop?

830
01:13:35,209 --> 01:13:37,541
Now will you stop?

831
01:13:38,846 --> 01:13:40,939
I don't understand this town.

832
01:13:41,015 --> 01:13:43,575
It's like something's
choking everybody...

833
01:13:43,651 --> 01:13:45,778
only they don't know they're choking.

834
01:13:45,853 --> 01:13:47,559
Let me ask you something.
Why this dance in this town?

835
01:13:47,594 --> 01:13:49,265
Let me ask you something.
Why this dance in this town?

836
01:13:51,005 --> 01:13:54,600
It's not just about a dance.
Not anymore.

837
01:13:54,676 --> 01:13:56,837
I know. That's what I mean.

838
01:13:57,812 --> 01:14:00,406
I watch you, I see.

839
01:14:07,088 --> 01:14:10,785
- You're not gonna understand this.
- Try me.

840
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:22,934
When Dad first threatened to leave,
I thought it was because of me.

841
01:14:23,004 --> 01:14:28,374
I thought it was something
that I wasn't doing right.

842
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:33,540
And I figured there was something I
could do to make it like it was...

843
01:14:33,615 --> 01:14:36,140
and then he'd want to stay, you know.

844
01:14:38,653 --> 01:14:42,145
But when he left just like that...

845
01:14:42,223 --> 01:14:46,853
I realized that everything I'd
done hoping that he'd stay...

846
01:14:48,763 --> 01:14:53,462
everything I'd done,
it didn't mean shit.

847
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,768
Didn't matter.

848
01:14:57,906 --> 01:15:00,841
And I felt like, "What
difference does it make?"

849
01:15:03,211 --> 01:15:04,644
But now...

850
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,577
Now I'm thinking...

851
01:15:09,651 --> 01:15:12,279
I could really do something, you know.

852
01:15:13,922 --> 01:15:17,756
I could really do something
for me this time, you know...

853
01:15:19,827 --> 01:15:22,295
otherwise I'm just gonna disappear.

854
01:15:39,547 --> 01:15:43,813
All right, Virginia, that ends
the discussion on this issue.

855
01:15:43,885 --> 01:15:47,719
So the price of a dog license
will go from $3.50 to $4.50.

856
01:15:47,789 --> 01:15:50,849
A licensed pet is a happy one.

857
01:15:50,925 --> 01:15:53,621
That takes care of old business.
Burlington?

858
01:15:54,729 --> 01:15:57,892
Thank you, Virginia. It was real good.

859
01:15:57,966 --> 01:16:02,699
Now we can consider any new business.

860
01:16:04,339 --> 01:16:06,569
Excuse me.

861
01:16:06,641 --> 01:16:10,338
Before we begin, I want
to remind all you kids...

862
01:16:10,411 --> 01:16:13,903
we're conducting an official meeting.

863
01:16:15,016 --> 01:16:17,746
We're not gonna tolerate
any disturbances.

864
01:16:20,588 --> 01:16:22,920
The floor is now open
for any new business.

865
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:27,325
My name is Ren McCormack and I
would like to move on behalf...

866
01:16:27,395 --> 01:16:31,889
of most of the senior class of
Bomont High School that the law...

867
01:16:31,966 --> 01:16:35,163
against public dancing within the
town limits of Bomont be abolished.

868
01:16:41,843 --> 01:16:44,505
Mr. Chairman, could I
address myself to this?

869
01:16:44,579 --> 01:16:46,206
You bet.

870
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,545
Even if this was not a law...

871
01:16:49,617 --> 01:16:52,051
which it is...

872
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:56,580
I'm afraid I would have difficulty
endorsing an enterprise...

873
01:16:56,658 --> 01:17:00,924
which is as fraught
with genuine peril...

874
01:17:00,995 --> 01:17:03,054
as I believe this one to be.

875
01:17:04,032 --> 01:17:09,868
Besides liquor and drugs, which
seem to accompany such an event...

876
01:17:09,937 --> 01:17:14,499
the thing that distresses
me even more, Ren...

877
01:17:14,575 --> 01:17:19,410
is the spiritual corruption
that can be involved.

878
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:24,008
These dances and this kind
of music can be destructive.

879
01:17:24,085 --> 01:17:27,282
And, Ren, I'm afraid
you're gonna find...

880
01:17:27,355 --> 01:17:30,620
that most of the people in our
community will agree with me.

881
01:17:30,692 --> 01:17:32,159
I do.

882
01:17:35,063 --> 01:17:38,430
- That's all I have to say.
- A vote is in order on the motion.

883
01:17:38,499 --> 01:17:41,935
- Will all those opposed...
- Excuse me, I...

884
01:17:42,003 --> 01:17:45,336
- I would like to say something.
- Please sit down.

885
01:17:45,406 --> 01:17:47,431
This is outrageous!

886
01:17:47,508 --> 01:17:49,942
- If you think that we're...
- Eleanor, sit down.

887
01:17:55,083 --> 01:17:57,745
I think Mr.
McCormack has a right to be heard.

888
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:09,362
I just wanted to say a few
words about this motion...

889
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:13,161
so that you wouldn't
think that we were...

890
01:18:13,234 --> 01:18:17,830
encouraging destruction with this idea.

891
01:18:20,508 --> 01:18:24,535
"From the oldest of times, people
danced for a number of reasons."

892
01:18:25,613 --> 01:18:27,672
They danced in prayer...

893
01:18:27,749 --> 01:18:31,014
or so that their crops
would be plentiful...

894
01:18:31,085 --> 01:18:33,019
or so their hunt would be good.

895
01:18:34,355 --> 01:18:38,451
And they danced to
stay physically fit...

896
01:18:38,526 --> 01:18:42,087
and show their community spirit.

897
01:18:42,163 --> 01:18:44,996
"And they danced to celebrate."

898
01:18:47,902 --> 01:18:50,996
And that is the dancing
we're talking about.

899
01:18:52,073 --> 01:18:57,375
Aren't we told in Psalm 149?

900
01:19:00,114 --> 01:19:02,844
"Praise ye the Lord."

901
01:19:02,917 --> 01:19:06,045
Sing unto the Lord a new song.

902
01:19:08,022 --> 01:19:10,388
"Let them praise his
name in the dance."

903
01:19:10,458 --> 01:19:12,050
Amen.

904
01:19:13,327 --> 01:19:15,761
And it was King David...

905
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:20,164
King David, who we
read about in Samuel.

906
01:19:20,234 --> 01:19:23,499
And what did David do?

907
01:19:23,571 --> 01:19:25,766
What did David do? What did David do?

908
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:31,676
"David danced before the
Lord with all his might...

909
01:19:31,746 --> 01:19:36,877
leaping and dancing before the Lord."

910
01:19:36,951 --> 01:19:39,511
Leaping and dancing.

911
01:19:46,994 --> 01:19:50,054
Ecclesiastes assures us...

912
01:19:52,266 --> 01:19:54,962
that there is a time for
every purpose under heaven.

913
01:19:57,672 --> 01:19:59,606
A time to laugh...

914
01:20:00,675 --> 01:20:02,609
and a time to weep.

915
01:20:04,378 --> 01:20:05,936
A time to mourn...

916
01:20:07,215 --> 01:20:10,548
and there is a time to dance.

917
01:20:21,796 --> 01:20:24,822
And there was a time for
this law, but not anymore.

918
01:20:24,899 --> 01:20:27,424
See, this is our time to dance.

919
01:20:27,501 --> 01:20:32,837
It is our way of celebrating life.

920
01:20:35,176 --> 01:20:37,644
It's the way it was in the beginning.

921
01:20:39,247 --> 01:20:44,412
It's the way it's always been.
It's the way it should be now.

922
01:21:04,105 --> 01:21:07,597
You know you were
railroaded, don't you? Huh?

923
01:21:08,843 --> 01:21:13,007
When are you gonna wake
up and smell the coffee?

924
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:17,141
Shaw Moore walked into that meeting
with votes already in his pocket.

925
01:21:17,218 --> 01:21:20,016
- You didn't have a prayer.
- Bad pun, Andy.

926
01:21:22,523 --> 01:21:25,219
What are you gonna do now?

927
01:21:25,293 --> 01:21:26,726
It's over.

928
01:21:27,828 --> 01:21:29,796
What if it ain't?

929
01:21:29,864 --> 01:21:32,492
What if you have your dance in Bayson?

930
01:21:32,566 --> 01:21:35,364
No. The whole point was to
do something here in Bomont.

931
01:21:35,436 --> 01:21:37,734
Bayson's, what, thirty miles away?

932
01:21:39,607 --> 01:21:42,599
Not where it runs up to
these tracks it ain't.

933
01:21:45,513 --> 01:21:48,846
I figure if the Bomont fire trucks
can't cross these tracks...

934
01:21:48,916 --> 01:21:50,850
neither can the long arm of the law.

935
01:21:50,918 --> 01:21:53,079
What about the long arm
of Reverend Moore?

936
01:21:53,154 --> 01:21:55,714
Remember he said if you could
find a way to convince him...

937
01:21:55,790 --> 01:21:58,054
it wouldn't be a spiritual
corruption, he'd think about it.

938
01:21:58,125 --> 01:22:01,151
- So?
- Make him think about it.

939
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:10,259
"And I beheld and heard
an angel flying..."

940
01:22:10,338 --> 01:22:13,671
through the midst of heaven
saying with a loud voice:

941
01:22:13,741 --> 01:22:17,199
"Woe, woe, woe...

942
01:22:17,278 --> 01:22:19,940
to the inhabiters of the earth."

943
01:22:20,014 --> 01:22:25,247
And I saw a star fall from
heaven unto the earth...

944
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:29,187
and the angel was given the key...

945
01:22:29,256 --> 01:22:31,884
to the bottomless pit.

946
01:22:31,959 --> 01:22:36,362
And he opened the bottomless pit...

947
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:41,925
and there arose a smoke out of the
pit as smoke of a great furnace.

948
01:22:42,003 --> 01:22:46,997
"And the sun and air were darkened
by reason of the smoke of the pit."

949
01:22:49,043 --> 01:22:50,476
Yes?

950
01:22:50,544 --> 01:22:54,139
I used to get such a kick watching
you work up your sermons.

951
01:22:57,218 --> 01:23:00,745
- And now?
- It's different.

952
01:23:00,821 --> 01:23:06,453
I see the stage. I see costumes.
It's show business, isn't it?

953
01:23:08,896 --> 01:23:10,329
Well...

954
01:23:12,166 --> 01:23:16,728
it's the only way I know to
reach people's emotions.

955
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:23,400
I haven't heard from you for a while.

956
01:23:25,646 --> 01:23:27,671
When was it? Thursday?

957
01:23:29,083 --> 01:23:31,017
I was angry, you were angry.

958
01:23:32,686 --> 01:23:34,620
- I was not.
- Yes, you were.

959
01:23:37,058 --> 01:23:41,085
If you weren't, you would've asked
me what was wrong. You knew.

960
01:23:41,162 --> 01:23:45,292
Ariel, I cannot let this dance happen.

961
01:23:45,366 --> 01:23:47,527
Ren McCormack made a lot
of people stop and think.

962
01:23:47,601 --> 01:23:50,365
I object to that kind of music,
and I think you know why.

963
01:23:50,438 --> 01:23:53,168
- Because people fornicate to it.
- I never said that.

964
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:56,141
- That's what you told the church board.
- That was not meant for your ears!

965
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:58,838
When do my ears get old enough, Daddy?
When do you stop protecting me?

966
01:23:58,913 --> 01:24:00,278
I'm no saint, you know!

967
01:24:00,347 --> 01:24:02,679
It is my duty to look after the
spiritual growth of you...

968
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:04,980
I'm not even a virgin.

969
01:24:07,521 --> 01:24:10,012
- Don't you talk like that in here!
- Why not?

970
01:24:10,091 --> 01:24:14,551
Isn't this where I'm supposed to confess
my sins to my preacher? In church!

971
01:24:14,628 --> 01:24:18,621
I ask to be forgiven. Am I?
Oh, forgive me, deliver me!

972
01:24:18,699 --> 01:24:21,691
Don't do that in here.
You know better where to draw the line!

973
01:24:21,769 --> 01:24:24,203
Thank heavens you're here.
People are calling.

974
01:24:24,271 --> 01:24:26,831
They're over at the library.

975
01:24:31,212 --> 01:24:34,079
Roger! Eleanor! What are you doing?

976
01:24:34,148 --> 01:24:36,082
We decided these books...

977
01:24:36,150 --> 01:24:39,916
Who's we?
Whose authority are you acting on?

978
01:24:39,987 --> 01:24:42,182
Hold it everybody! Listen to me!

979
01:24:44,391 --> 01:24:47,554
When did you all decide
to sit in judgment?

980
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:54,595
Who elected you to be the saviors
of everybody's souls in Beaumont?

981
01:24:54,668 --> 01:24:57,967
We have a perfect right to
determine what our children...

982
01:25:00,474 --> 01:25:04,604
When you've burned all of these,
what are you gonna do then?

983
01:25:07,148 --> 01:25:09,082
Chris, take these out of here.

984
01:25:11,919 --> 01:25:15,116
Satan is not in these books.

985
01:25:15,189 --> 01:25:17,749
He's in here!

986
01:25:17,825 --> 01:25:20,658
He's in your hearts.

987
01:25:20,728 --> 01:25:23,356
Go on home, all of you.

988
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:25,728
Go and sit in judgment on yourselves.

989
01:25:27,635 --> 01:25:30,468
And, Roger, go home.

990
01:25:31,705 --> 01:25:33,195
Eleanor, come on.

991
01:25:35,276 --> 01:25:37,244
Go home now, both of you.

992
01:26:15,349 --> 01:26:17,647
Sometimes things don't make any sense.

993
01:26:17,718 --> 01:26:22,121
If you could explain to me my father
maybe I could explain your son.

994
01:26:24,024 --> 01:26:25,958
But it doesn't make any sense.

995
01:26:29,730 --> 01:26:32,665
Look, I gotta go.

996
01:26:35,336 --> 01:26:38,362
Listen, I know you're gonna
do what you gotta do...

997
01:26:38,439 --> 01:26:42,273
but thanks for listening.

998
01:26:49,116 --> 01:26:51,141
Thank you for...

999
01:26:53,854 --> 01:26:57,051
Well, thank you.

1000
01:27:12,373 --> 01:27:15,240
That was your friend Ren.

1001
01:27:15,309 --> 01:27:19,075
He came here to ask me if he
could take you to a senior prom.

1002
01:27:24,585 --> 01:27:26,576
I'm running out of answers.

1003
01:27:28,622 --> 01:27:30,590
I know how hard it is for you.

1004
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:35,428
I'm know I'm not making it easier.

1005
01:27:41,769 --> 01:27:45,637
I just don't know that I believe
in everything you believe in...

1006
01:27:48,909 --> 01:27:51,139
but I believe in you.

1007
01:28:15,769 --> 01:28:21,139
I'm standing up here
before you today...

1008
01:28:23,744 --> 01:28:26,008
with a very troubled heart.

1009
01:28:30,284 --> 01:28:31,352
You see, my friends...

1010
01:28:31,387 --> 01:28:32,421
You see, my friends...

1011
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:37,390
I've always insisted on...

1012
01:28:37,462 --> 01:28:41,091
taking responsibility for your lives.

1013
01:28:42,367 --> 01:28:45,530
But, I'm really...

1014
01:28:47,272 --> 01:28:49,934
like a first-time parent...

1015
01:28:51,009 --> 01:28:53,773
who makes mistakes...

1016
01:28:53,845 --> 01:28:57,212
and tries to learn from them.

1017
01:29:00,251 --> 01:29:02,742
And like that parent...

1018
01:29:04,055 --> 01:29:09,891
I find myself at that moment
when I have to decide.

1019
01:29:11,429 --> 01:29:13,363
Do I hold on...

1020
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:19,599
or do I trust you to yourselves?

1021
01:29:19,671 --> 01:29:25,166
Let go and hope that
you've understood...

1022
01:29:25,243 --> 01:29:28,940
at least some of my lessons.

1023
01:29:33,385 --> 01:29:37,344
If we don't start
trusting our children...

1024
01:29:37,422 --> 01:29:42,359
how will they ever become trustworthy?

1025
01:29:45,196 --> 01:29:48,097
I'm told that the senior
class at the high school...

1026
01:29:48,166 --> 01:29:51,192
has got use of the
warehouse in Bayson...

1027
01:29:51,269 --> 01:29:55,968
for the purpose of putting
on a senior dance.

1028
01:29:57,409 --> 01:29:58,842
Please...

1029
01:30:00,512 --> 01:30:05,279
join me to pray to the Lord...

1030
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:07,341
to guide them in their endeavors.

1031
01:31:45,717 --> 01:31:46,911
Lights!

1032
01:32:09,574 --> 01:32:11,542
- You look very nice.
- Oh, no.

1033
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:14,373
Yes, you do. Yes, you look very nice.

1034
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:16,379
Yes, you do. You look wonderful.

1035
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:18,677
- You think?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1036
01:32:24,189 --> 01:32:27,454
You can't very well go to
a prom without a corsage.

1037
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:32,286
Oh, Mom.

1038
01:32:32,363 --> 01:32:34,388
This is gorgeous!

1039
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:41,764
- Where do you think I should...
- Here's a wrist thing.

1040
01:32:41,839 --> 01:32:44,034
Oh, Mom, you really didn't have to.

1041
01:32:44,108 --> 01:32:45,541
I didn't.

1042
01:32:49,314 --> 01:32:53,182
Don't go on to him about it
because he'll only deny it.

1043
01:33:05,063 --> 01:33:09,227
I was gonna come up and get... I was...

1044
01:33:10,435 --> 01:33:12,995
gonna come up and get you.

1045
01:33:13,071 --> 01:33:14,298
What's the matter?

1046
01:33:16,048 --> 01:33:17,432
You're beautiful.

1047
01:33:20,712 --> 01:33:22,145
What?

1048
01:33:30,255 --> 01:33:31,560
I mean it.

1049
01:33:33,161 --> 01:33:34,783
You are beautiful.

1050
01:33:41,099 --> 01:33:42,532
Come on.

1051
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:54,644
Thank you.

1052
01:36:04,976 --> 01:36:08,571
- Let's take a closer look.
- No. She'll think I'm checking up.

1053
01:36:08,646 --> 01:36:11,171
No. She won't even know we're here.
Come on.

1054
01:36:16,587 --> 01:36:19,420
You're the last folks I expected
to see around here tonight.

1055
01:36:19,490 --> 01:36:22,254
- Good evening, Andy.
- Hi, Andy.

1056
01:36:22,326 --> 01:36:24,453
Reverend, you done a good thing here.

1057
01:36:25,463 --> 01:36:27,488
I'm still not sure it
was the right thing.

1058
01:36:27,565 --> 01:36:28,998
Comes close.

1059
01:36:47,018 --> 01:36:48,451
Shaw?

1060
01:36:59,197 --> 01:37:00,789
What is it?

1061
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:07,803
It's just the two of us again.

1062
01:37:26,190 --> 01:37:28,624
- Shaw?
- What?

1063
01:37:30,228 --> 01:37:32,594
We're almost dancing.

1064
01:37:41,873 --> 01:37:44,341
- Hi, Rusty.
- Hi.

1065
01:37:54,585 --> 01:37:56,280
Hello, Willard.

1066
01:37:57,522 --> 01:37:59,456
You promised you won't fight.

1067
01:37:59,524 --> 01:38:01,389
Don't you look sweet.

1068
01:38:04,795 --> 01:38:08,754
- What do you want?
- I've got business with McCormack.

1069
01:38:08,833 --> 01:38:11,427
Cool it, all right.
No fights tonight, okay?

1070
01:38:12,803 --> 01:38:14,737
Hey, no fights, fellas.

1071
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:17,373
Sure, Willard.

1072
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:21,175
All right.

1073
01:38:23,414 --> 01:38:26,281
Cute. No fights, Willard.

1074
01:38:26,350 --> 01:38:31,014
Damn, man! I told you.
I promised Rusty no fights tonight.

1075
01:38:32,423 --> 01:38:34,789
Let me go, goddamn it!

1076
01:38:35,927 --> 01:38:38,725
- Oh, Willard!
- What do you want me to do, Rusty?

1077
01:38:38,796 --> 01:38:42,197
Kill the son of a bitch!
Help, somebody!

1078
01:38:45,436 --> 01:38:49,839
- Chuck!
- Hey, it's Mr. Dance Fever.

1079
01:38:49,907 --> 01:38:52,637
You're a goddamn hero
when it's five to one.

1080
01:38:54,612 --> 01:38:57,240
Ren, get up! Beat the shit out of him!

1081
01:39:08,793 --> 01:39:10,283
Bastard!

1082
01:39:14,765 --> 01:39:16,528
You're gonna dance now.

1083
01:39:29,313 --> 01:39:30,746
All right!

1084
01:39:35,753 --> 01:39:37,914
- Hey, handsome.
- Great dance, man.

1085
01:39:37,989 --> 01:39:40,150
Fighter heroes!

1086
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:43,250
I thought you guys were actually
gonna fight or something.

1087
01:39:43,327 --> 01:39:44,760
You're great.

1088
01:39:44,829 --> 01:39:48,788
Hey, what's this I see?
I thought this was a party.

1089
01:39:48,866 --> 01:39:50,493
Let's dance!

1090
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:14,023
Just watch, all right?
