00:03:00,357 --> 00:03:04,195
Captain's Log:
Stardate 8130.3.

2
00:03:04,278 --> 00:03:07,198
Starship Enterprise
on training mission

3
00:03:07,281 --> 00:03:10,284
to Gamma Hydra,
Section 14,

4
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:12,286
coordinates 22-87-4.

5
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:16,040
Approaching neutral zone.

6
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:19,210
All systems normal
and functioning.

7
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:21,712
Leaving Section 14
for Section 15.

8
00:03:21,795 --> 00:03:23,714
Stand by.

9
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:27,301
Project parabolic course
to avoid entering neutral zone.

10
00:03:27,384 --> 00:03:28,302
Aye, Captain.

11
00:03:30,638 --> 00:03:32,473
Course change projected.

12
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:33,974
Captain,
I'm getting something

13
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:35,392
on the distress channel.

14
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:37,061
On speakers.

15
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:38,312
Imperative.

16
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:40,064
This is Kobayashi Maru.

17
00:03:40,147 --> 00:03:44,652
We've struck a gravitic mine
and have lost power.

18
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:47,655
Our hull is penetrated
and we have sustained...

19
00:03:47,738 --> 00:03:50,074
This is the starship
Enterprise.

20
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:52,576
Your message
is breaking up.

21
00:03:52,618 --> 00:03:54,537
Can you give us your
coordinates?

22
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:58,082
Our position is Gamma Hydra,
Section 10.

23
00:03:58,123 --> 00:04:00,084
In the neutral zone.

24
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,335
Hull penetrated.

25
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:03,337
Life support
systems failing.

26
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,964
Can you assist us,
Enterprise?

27
00:04:05,089 --> 00:04:07,091
Data on Kobayashi Maru.

28
00:04:07,216 --> 00:04:10,511
Vessel is third-class
neutronic fuel carrier,

29
00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:12,930
crew of 81,300 passengers.

30
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:15,349
Damn.

31
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:21,021
Mr. Sulu,
plot an intercept course.

32
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:24,942
May I remind you that if the starship
enters the zone...

33
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:27,862
I'm aware of my responsibilities,
mister.

34
00:04:32,616 --> 00:04:35,536
Estimating two minutes
to intercept.

35
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,875
Now entering
the neutral zone.

36
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,627
Warning.
We have entered neutral zone.

37
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:46,630
We are now in violation
of treaty, Captain.

38
00:04:46,672 --> 00:04:48,132
Stand by,
transporter room,

39
00:04:48,174 --> 00:04:50,134
ready to beam
survivors aboard.

40
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:52,720
Captain,
I've lost their signal.

41
00:04:52,803 --> 00:04:56,223
Alert. Three Klingon cruisers
bearing 3-1-6 mark 4,

42
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:57,475
closing fast.

43
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:58,559
Visual.

44
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:03,147
Battle stations.
Activate shields.

45
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:05,483
Shields activated.

46
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:08,152
Tell them we're
on a rescue mission.

47
00:05:08,235 --> 00:05:09,820
They're jamming
the frequencies.

48
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:11,989
Klingons on attack course
and closing.

49
00:05:12,072 --> 00:05:13,491
We're over our heads.

50
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:15,993
Mr. Sulu,
get us out of here.

51
00:05:16,076 --> 00:05:17,578
I'll try, Captain.

52
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:20,414
Alert. Klingon torpedoes
activated. Alert.

53
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:21,499
Evasive action.

54
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:28,422
Engineering, damage report.

55
00:05:28,506 --> 00:05:30,007
Main energizer hit,
Captain.

56
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,509
Engage auxiliary power.

57
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:33,177
Prepare to return fire.

58
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,513
Aah!

59
00:05:35,513 --> 00:05:37,515
Shields collapsing,
Captain.

60
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:43,103
Fire all phasers.

61
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:45,606
No power
to the weapons, Captain.

62
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:51,946
Captain, it's no use.

63
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:54,782
We're dead in space.

64
00:05:54,865 --> 00:05:56,784
Activate escape pods.

65
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:58,869
Send out the log buoy.

66
00:05:58,953 --> 00:06:00,371
All hands abandon ship.

67
00:06:00,454 --> 00:06:02,373
All right, open it up.

68
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:13,717
Any suggestions, Admiral?

69
00:06:13,717 --> 00:06:15,553
Prayer, Mr. Saavik.

70
00:06:15,636 --> 00:06:18,055
The Klingons
don't take prisoners.

71
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:19,557
Lights.

72
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:21,559
Blowers on.

73
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:25,396
Captain.

74
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:33,737
Trainees,
to the briefing room.

75
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:36,574
Maintenance Crew,
report to bridge simulator.

76
00:06:36,657 --> 00:06:40,911
Maintenance Crew,
report to bridge simulator.

77
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:42,580
Physician, heal thyself.

78
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:46,000
Is that all?
What about my performance?

79
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,835
I'm not
a drama critic.

80
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:52,506
Staying with
a sinking ship?

81
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,592
Permission
to speak candidly, sir.

82
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:55,676
Granted.

83
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,180
This was not a fair test
of my abilities.

84
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:00,181
Why not?

85
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:03,684
Because there was
no way to win.

86
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:06,687
A no-win situation
is always possible.

87
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:09,190
Has that never
occurred to you?

88
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:11,192
No, sir, it has not.

89
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:14,195
Dealing with death
is at least as important

90
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:16,197
as dealing with life.

91
00:07:16,197 --> 00:07:19,200
That thought had not
occurred to me.

92
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,036
Now you have something new
to think about.

93
00:07:22,036 --> 00:07:23,204
Carry on.

94
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:26,207
Engineering Cadets,
assemble on C Level.

95
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:31,378
Admiral, why not put
an experienced crew on the ship?

96
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:33,380
Galloping around the cosmos

97
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,217
is a game for the young.

98
00:07:36,217 --> 00:07:38,636
Now, what does that mean?

99
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,227
Aren't you dead?

100
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:50,731
I assume you're
loitering around here

101
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:54,235
to learn what efficiency rating
I plan to give your cadets.

102
00:07:54,235 --> 00:07:56,737
I am understandably curious.

103
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:59,240
They destroyed
the simulator room

104
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,158
and you with it.

105
00:08:01,242 --> 00:08:03,160
The Kobayashi Maru
scenario

106
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:06,664
frequently wreaks havoc with students
and equipment.

107
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:10,167
You took the test
three times yourself.

108
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:12,670
Your final solution
was unique.

109
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:14,880
That was its virtue.

110
00:08:15,005 --> 00:08:18,676
Oh, by the way,
thank you for this.

111
00:08:18,717 --> 00:08:22,179
I know of your fondness
for antiques.

112
00:08:22,263 --> 00:08:25,266
"It was the best of times,

113
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:28,352
it was the worst of times."

114
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:29,854
Message, Spock?

115
00:08:29,937 --> 00:08:32,940
None that I know.
Except, of course, happy birthday.

116
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,192
Surely the best of times.

117
00:08:35,276 --> 00:08:36,277
Captain Spock,

118
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,196
space shuttle leaving
in 15 minutes.

119
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,824
Where are you off to?

120
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:45,077
The Enterprise,
to check in before your inspection.

121
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,620
And you?

122
00:08:48,372 --> 00:08:49,623
Home.

123
00:09:05,723 --> 00:09:08,142
Bless me, Doctor,
what beams you

124
00:09:08,184 --> 00:09:11,145
into this neck
of the woods?

125
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:13,147
Beware Romulans
bearing gifts.

126
00:09:15,232 --> 00:09:17,109
Happy birthday, Jim.

127
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:18,611
Thanks.

128
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:22,156
Romulan ale.

129
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:24,658
Why, Bones,
this is illegal.

130
00:09:24,742 --> 00:09:27,161
I only use it
for medicinal purposes.

131
00:09:27,244 --> 00:09:30,164
I got aboard a ship
that brings it in.

132
00:09:30,247 --> 00:09:32,750
Now, don't be a prig.

133
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,084
2283.

134
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:38,172
Well, it takes this stuff
a while to ferment.

135
00:09:38,255 --> 00:09:40,174
Here, give me.

136
00:09:40,257 --> 00:09:42,676
Now, you open this one.

137
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,678
I'm almost afraid to.

138
00:09:44,762 --> 00:09:47,681
What is it?
Klingon aphrodisiacs?

139
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:49,141
No.

140
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:53,270
Bones, this is...

141
00:09:53,354 --> 00:09:54,814
charming.

142
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,774
For most patients
your age,

143
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:59,026
I'd recommend
Retinax 5.

144
00:09:59,109 --> 00:10:00,778
I'm allergic
to Retinax.

145
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:02,404
Exactly. Cheers!

146
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,031
Cheers.

147
00:10:11,288 --> 00:10:13,290
Ahh.

148
00:10:13,374 --> 00:10:15,042
Happy birthday.

149
00:10:16,627 --> 00:10:19,380
I don't know
what to say.

150
00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:21,340
You could say thank you.

151
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:22,883
Thank you.

152
00:10:27,304 --> 00:10:30,724
Damn it, Jim,
what the hell's the matter with you?

153
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,061
Why are we treating your birthday
like a funeral?

154
00:10:34,145 --> 00:10:37,064
Bones, I don't want
to be lectured.

155
00:10:37,148 --> 00:10:39,066
What the hell
do you want?

156
00:10:41,152 --> 00:10:45,573
This is not about age,
and you know it.

157
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:48,576
It's about you flying
a goddamn computer console

158
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:51,662
when you want to be
out there hopping galaxies.

159
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:53,581
Spare me
your poetry.

160
00:10:53,664 --> 00:10:55,583
We all have
assigned duties.

161
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,084
Bull!

162
00:10:57,168 --> 00:11:00,921
You're hiding- hiding behind
rules and regulations.

163
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:02,590
From whom?

164
00:11:02,673 --> 00:11:05,009
From yourself, Admiral.

165
00:11:10,097 --> 00:11:12,016
Don't mince words, Bones.

166
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:14,518
What do you really think?

167
00:11:18,606 --> 00:11:25,029
Jim, I'm your doctor,
and I'm your friend.

168
00:11:25,112 --> 00:11:27,031
Get back your command.

169
00:11:27,114 --> 00:11:30,034
Get it back
before you turn

170
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:32,536
into part
of this collection,

171
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,290
before you
really do grow old.

172
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:56,560
Starship Log:
Stardate 8130.4.

173
00:11:56,644 --> 00:11:59,480
Log entry
by First Officer Pavel Chekov.

174
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,400
Starship Reliant on orbital approach
to Ceti Alpha VI

175
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:06,487
in connection
with Project Genesis.

176
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:08,906
We are searching
for a lifeless planet

177
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:10,908
to use as a test site

178
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:12,409
for the Genesis experiment.

179
00:12:12,493 --> 00:12:13,911
So far, no success.

180
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:15,412
Standard orbit, please.

181
00:12:15,496 --> 00:12:18,999
Mr. Beach, any change
in the surface scan?

182
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,501
Negative.

183
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:23,504
Limited atmosphere
dominated by kraylon gas,

184
00:12:23,587 --> 00:12:25,506
sand, high-velocity winds.

185
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:28,175
incapable of supporting life forms.

186
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:31,512
Does it have to be
completely lifeless?

187
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:33,514
Have you found something?

188
00:12:33,597 --> 00:12:37,017
We picked up
a minor energy flux

189
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:39,019
on one dynoscanner.

190
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:41,021
Damn. Are you sure?

191
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:44,024
Maybe the scanner's
out of adjustment.

192
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:48,028
I suppose it could be a particle
of preanimate matter

193
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:50,030
caught in the matrix.

194
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:53,534
Get on the Comm-pic
to Dr. Marcus.

195
00:12:53,617 --> 00:12:55,035
Aye, sir.

196
00:12:55,119 --> 00:12:58,038
Maybe it's something
we can transplant.

197
00:12:58,122 --> 00:13:01,041
You know what she'll say.

198
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,543
Let me get this straight-

199
00:13:02,626 --> 00:13:04,044
something you can transplant?

200
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:05,963
Yes, Doctor.

201
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:08,048
Something you can transplant?

202
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,552
I don't know.

203
00:13:11,552 --> 00:13:15,306
But it may only be
preanimate matter.

204
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:17,725
Then again, it may not.

205
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:21,729
There can't be
so much as a microbe,

206
00:13:21,729 --> 00:13:23,731
or the show's off.

207
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:27,151
Have a look.
If it can be moved-

208
00:13:27,234 --> 00:13:29,403
You bet, Doctor.
we're on our way.

209
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:37,578
Well, don't have kittens.
Genesis will work.

210
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:41,081
They'll remember you
with Newton, Einstein, Surak.

211
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:44,084
Thanks. No respect
from my offspring.

212
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:46,086
Par for the course.

213
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,590
You teaming up
with me for bridge?

214
00:13:49,673 --> 00:13:51,091
Maybe.

215
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:53,093
What is it?

216
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:56,096
Whenever we deal
with Starfleet,

217
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,098
I get nervous.

218
00:13:58,182 --> 00:14:00,601
We are dealing
with something

219
00:14:00,684 --> 00:14:04,522
that could be perverted
into a dreadful weapon.

220
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:07,024
Remember that overgrown Boy Scout

221
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:09,026
you hung around with?

222
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:11,529
Jim Kirk
was many things,

223
00:14:11,612 --> 00:14:15,032
but he was never
a boy scout.

224
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:19,870
Captain Terrell,
standby to beam down.

225
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:35,553
Chekov,
are you sure

226
00:14:35,636 --> 00:14:38,222
these are
the correct coordinates?

227
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:41,058
Captain, this is
the garden spot

228
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:43,060
of Ceti Alpha VI.

229
00:14:44,145 --> 00:14:46,564
I can barely see it.

230
00:14:55,656 --> 00:14:57,575
There's nothing here.

231
00:14:57,658 --> 00:15:00,578
The tricorder
must be broken.

232
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:16,844
Chekov, over here.

233
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:26,437
Those look like
cargo carriers.

234
00:15:35,613 --> 00:15:38,032
Hey, give me a hand.

235
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:18,322
What the hell happened?

236
00:16:18,405 --> 00:16:20,324
If they crashed,

237
00:16:20,407 --> 00:16:23,410
where's the rest
of the ship?

238
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,092
What the hell is that?

239
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:53,440
Botany Bay?

240
00:16:54,608 --> 00:16:56,777
Botany Bay!

241
00:16:57,611 --> 00:16:59,613
Oh, no!

242
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:02,867
We've got to leave now!

243
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,368
What about-

244
00:17:04,493 --> 00:17:06,370
Never mind that. Hurry!

245
00:17:06,453 --> 00:17:08,873
Chekov, what's wrong
with you?

246
00:17:08,956 --> 00:17:10,040
Chekov?

247
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:13,294
Come on! Hurry!

248
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:29,810
Starship Reliant
to Captain Terrell.

249
00:17:29,894 --> 00:17:32,271
This is Commander Kyle.

250
00:17:32,313 --> 00:17:34,732
Will you please
respond, Captain?

251
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,236
Captain Terrell,
respond, please.

252
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:46,702
Let's give them
a little more time.

253
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:21,695
Khan.

254
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,379
I don't know you.

255
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:47,471
But you...

256
00:18:47,555 --> 00:18:51,058
I never forget a face.

257
00:18:51,142 --> 00:18:52,977
Mr...

258
00:18:54,812 --> 00:18:56,147
Chekov.

259
00:18:57,606 --> 00:18:58,941
Isn't it?

260
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:04,488
I never thought
to see your face again.

261
00:19:04,572 --> 00:19:06,490
Chekov,
who is this man?

262
00:19:06,574 --> 00:19:08,492
A criminal, Captain.

263
00:19:08,492 --> 00:19:11,954
A product of 20th-century
genetic engineering.

264
00:19:11,996 --> 00:19:14,915
What do you want?
I demand to be-

265
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:19,336
You are in a position
to demand nothing, sir.

266
00:19:19,336 --> 00:19:21,839
I, on the other hand,

267
00:19:21,881 --> 00:19:25,342
am in a position
to grant nothing.

268
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:28,846
What you see
is all that remains

269
00:19:28,846 --> 00:19:32,016
of the ship's company
and crew

270
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:34,018
of the Botany Bay,

271
00:19:34,101 --> 00:19:38,355
marooned here 15 years ago
by Captain James T. Kirk.

272
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:41,275
Listen,
you men and women-

273
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:43,360
Captain, Captain.

274
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:48,324
Save your strength,
Captain.

275
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:50,784
These people had sworn

276
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:54,205
to live and die
at my command

277
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:56,874
200 years
before you were born.

278
00:19:56,874 --> 00:20:02,880
Do you mean he never
told you the tale?

279
00:20:02,922 --> 00:20:04,882
To amuse your Captain?

280
00:20:04,965 --> 00:20:06,383
No?

281
00:20:06,425 --> 00:20:08,803
Never told you

282
00:20:08,928 --> 00:20:11,388
How the Enterprise
picked up the Botany Bay

283
00:20:11,472 --> 00:20:14,892
lost in space
from the year 1996,

284
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,813
myself and the ship's company
in cryogenic freeze?

285
00:20:18,813 --> 00:20:21,065
I've never even met
Admiral Kirk.

286
00:20:21,148 --> 00:20:22,399
Admiral?

287
00:20:22,483 --> 00:20:23,776
Admiral.

288
00:20:25,152 --> 00:20:26,320
Admiral.

289
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:32,910
Never told you

290
00:20:32,993 --> 00:20:37,414
how Admiral Kirk
sent 70 of us into exile

291
00:20:37,456 --> 00:20:39,917
on this barren sand heap

292
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,839
with only the contents
of these cargo bays

293
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,006
to sustain us?

294
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,844
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V,
there was life.

295
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:51,345
A fair chance-

296
00:20:51,428 --> 00:20:53,430
This is Ceti Alpha V!

297
00:21:01,522 --> 00:21:03,774
Ceti Alpha VI exploded

298
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:07,778
six months after
we were left here.

299
00:21:07,862 --> 00:21:10,322
The shock
shifted the orbit

300
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:12,283
of this planet,

301
00:21:12,408 --> 00:21:15,119
and everything
was laid waste.

302
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:17,788
Admiral Kirk
never bothered to check

303
00:21:17,872 --> 00:21:20,291
on our progress.

304
00:21:23,878 --> 00:21:26,297
It was only the fact

305
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,799
of my genetically
engineered intellect

306
00:21:28,883 --> 00:21:31,302
that allowed us
to survive.

307
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:37,308
On earth...

308
00:21:39,393 --> 00:21:41,312
200 years ago...

309
00:21:42,897 --> 00:21:45,816
I was a prince...

310
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,737
with power over millions.

311
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,822
Captain Kirk
was your host.

312
00:21:51,906 --> 00:21:53,324
You repaid
his hospitality

313
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:56,076
by trying
to steal his ship

314
00:21:56,202 --> 00:21:57,620
and murder him.

315
00:22:07,838 --> 00:22:11,342
You didn't expect
to find me.

316
00:22:11,342 --> 00:22:15,679
You thought
this was Ceti Alpha VI.

317
00:22:16,847 --> 00:22:18,349
Ahh.

318
00:22:19,683 --> 00:22:22,102
Why are you here?

319
00:22:31,195 --> 00:22:33,531
Why?

320
00:22:40,371 --> 00:22:42,873
Allow me
to introduce you

321
00:22:42,873 --> 00:22:44,875
to Ceti Alpha V's

322
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:48,629
only remaining
indigenous life form.

323
00:22:59,557 --> 00:23:00,975
What do you think?

324
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:04,311
It killed
20 of my people...

325
00:23:07,231 --> 00:23:09,400
including my beloved wife.

326
00:23:24,832 --> 00:23:27,251
Oh, not all at once.

327
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:35,092
And not instantly,
to be sure.

328
00:23:46,437 --> 00:23:47,855
You see,

329
00:23:47,938 --> 00:23:50,858
their young enter
through the ears

330
00:23:50,941 --> 00:23:53,861
and wrap themselves
around the cerebral cortex.

331
00:23:53,944 --> 00:23:57,865
This has the effect
of rendering the victim

332
00:23:57,948 --> 00:24:02,453
extremely susceptible
to, uh...suggestion.

333
00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:08,292
Later, as they grow...

334
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:12,213
follows madness...

335
00:24:13,631 --> 00:24:14,882
and death.

336
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,809
Khan, listen to me.

337
00:24:24,892 --> 00:24:29,146
These are pets,
of course.

338
00:24:31,565 --> 00:24:35,820
Not quite domesticated.

339
00:24:35,903 --> 00:24:37,238
Khan,

340
00:24:37,321 --> 00:24:41,075
Captain Kirk
was only doing his duty.

341
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:52,086
Aah!

342
00:24:52,086 --> 00:24:57,591
Aaaahh!

343
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,771
That's better.

344
00:25:12,773 --> 00:25:17,027
Now, tell me,
why are you here?

345
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:19,530
And tell me

346
00:25:19,613 --> 00:25:24,034
where I may find
James Kirk.

347
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,039
Enterprise to Admiral Kirk's shuttle.

348
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:30,541
You're cleared for docking.

349
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,043
Approach portside
torpedo bay.

350
00:25:35,546 --> 00:25:39,550
Enterprise, this is
Admiral Kirk's party on final approach.

351
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:42,470
Enterprise welcomes you.
Prepare for docking.

352
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,319
I hate inspections.

353
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:04,074
I'm delighted.
Any chance to go aboard the Enterprise.

354
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:16,420
I'm glad you're at the helm
for three weeks.

355
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,589
These kids
can't steer.

356
00:26:35,356 --> 00:26:36,774
Open the air lock.

357
00:26:37,858 --> 00:26:39,777
Permission to come aboard.

358
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,947
You're welcome.
You know my training crew.

359
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,199
Certainly they know you.

360
00:26:45,282 --> 00:26:48,619
We've been through
death and life together.

361
00:26:51,872 --> 00:26:54,792
Mr. Scott, you old space dog,
you're well.

362
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:57,294
I had a wee bout, sir,

363
00:26:57,378 --> 00:26:59,797
but Dr. McCoy
pulled me through.

364
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,799
Wee bout of what?

365
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,801
Shore leave, Admiral.

366
00:27:05,302 --> 00:27:07,304
Who do we have here?

367
00:27:07,304 --> 00:27:11,308
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston,
Engineer's Mate, sir.

368
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:13,811
First training voyage,
Mr. Preston?

369
00:27:13,811 --> 00:27:14,812
Yes, sir.

370
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:16,147
I see.

371
00:27:16,147 --> 00:27:19,817
Shall we start
with the engine room?

372
00:27:19,817 --> 00:27:22,319
We'll see you there.
Everything is in order.

373
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:25,823
That'll be a pleasant surprise,
Mr. Scott.

374
00:27:25,823 --> 00:27:29,493
I'll see you
on the bridge, Admiral.

375
00:27:29,577 --> 00:27:31,912
Company, dismissed.

376
00:28:22,046 --> 00:28:25,466
Well, Mr. Scott,
are your cadets capable

377
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:27,968
of handling
a minor training cruise?

378
00:28:27,968 --> 00:28:28,969
Give the word, Admiral.

379
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:30,971
The word is given.

380
00:28:30,971 --> 00:28:32,473
Aye, sir.

381
00:28:32,473 --> 00:28:35,893
What about the rest
of the inspection?

382
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,408
This is
Starfleet operations.

383
00:28:51,492 --> 00:28:53,410
Enterprise is clear
for departure.

384
00:28:53,494 --> 00:28:55,496
Admiral on the bridge.

385
00:29:04,505 --> 00:29:06,423
Running lights on.

386
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,929
Very well,
Mr. Saavik.

387
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:14,431
You may clear
all moorings.

388
00:29:14,515 --> 00:29:16,684
Aye, sir.

389
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:19,436
All moorings are cleared,
Captain.

390
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,688
Thank you.

391
00:29:24,358 --> 00:29:25,442
Lieutenant,

392
00:29:27,027 --> 00:29:30,698
have you piloted a starship
out of space dock?

393
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:31,949
Never, sir.

394
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,462
Take her out,
Mr. Saavik.

395
00:29:46,547 --> 00:29:47,965
Aye, sir.

396
00:29:55,389 --> 00:29:58,976
For everything there is
a first time, Lieutenant.

397
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:00,978
Don't you agree, Admiral?

398
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:01,979
Uh-huh.

399
00:30:02,062 --> 00:30:03,981
Aft thrusters,
Mr. Sulu.

400
00:30:04,064 --> 00:30:06,317
Aft thrusters.

401
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,985
Would you like
a tranquilizer?

402
00:30:08,068 --> 00:30:10,488
Add 1 /4 impulse power.

403
00:30:10,488 --> 00:30:13,491
Add 1 /4 impulse power.

404
00:31:23,894 --> 00:31:25,980
We are free
to navigate.

405
00:31:26,063 --> 00:31:28,399
Course heading, Captain?

406
00:31:28,482 --> 00:31:30,484
Captain's discretion.

407
00:31:30,568 --> 00:31:32,069
Mr. Sulu,

408
00:31:32,153 --> 00:31:35,656
you may...
indulge yourself.

409
00:31:36,991 --> 00:31:38,075
Aye, sir.

410
00:32:04,351 --> 00:32:06,270
Does that
about do it?

411
00:32:06,353 --> 00:32:08,272
I doubt
we could squeeze

412
00:32:08,355 --> 00:32:11,358
any more information
into the memory banks.

413
00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:12,860
We'll design
a bigger one.

414
00:32:12,943 --> 00:32:14,361
Who would build it?

415
00:32:14,445 --> 00:32:15,863
Dr. Marcus,
Comm-pic coming in

416
00:32:15,946 --> 00:32:18,115
on the hyperchannel.

417
00:32:18,199 --> 00:32:20,618
It's the starship Reliant.

418
00:32:20,701 --> 00:32:23,037
On the screen, Jedda.

419
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,955
Come in, please.

420
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,459
This is the Reliant
callingRegula-1.

421
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:31,462
Repeat,
this is U.S.S. Reliant.

422
00:32:31,545 --> 00:32:33,464
Commander, we are receiving.

423
00:32:33,547 --> 00:32:35,466
This is Regula-1 .

424
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:37,468
Ah, Dr. Marcus. Good.

425
00:32:37,551 --> 00:32:39,470
We're en route to you

426
00:32:39,553 --> 00:32:43,474
and should be there
in three days.

427
00:32:43,557 --> 00:32:46,477
We weren't expecting you
for three months.

428
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,562
Has something happened?

429
00:32:48,646 --> 00:32:52,483
No. Ceti Alpha VI
has checked out.

430
00:32:52,566 --> 00:32:54,985
Then why
are you coming-

431
00:32:55,069 --> 00:32:56,821
We have new orders.

432
00:32:56,904 --> 00:32:59,990
All materials
of Project Genesis

433
00:33:00,074 --> 00:33:03,077
will be transferred
to this ship

434
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,913
fortesting
on Ceti Alpha VI.

435
00:33:05,996 --> 00:33:08,916
Who do they
think they are?

436
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:12,086
Commander Chekov,
this is completely irregular.

437
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:14,839
I have my orders.

438
00:33:14,922 --> 00:33:17,925
Pin him down, mother.
Who gave the order?

439
00:33:19,343 --> 00:33:21,262
The order comes from...

440
00:33:23,848 --> 00:33:25,850
Admiral James T. Kirk.

441
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:27,852
I knew it!

442
00:33:27,935 --> 00:33:29,770
The military's
been waiting

443
00:33:29,854 --> 00:33:32,773
to get
their hands on it.

444
00:33:32,857 --> 00:33:35,276
I have no intention
of allowing Reliant

445
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,777
or any unauthorized personnel

446
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:38,529
access to our work.

447
00:33:38,612 --> 00:33:41,615
I am sorry
that you feel that way.

448
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:44,702
Admiral Kirk's orders
are confirmed.

449
00:33:44,785 --> 00:33:47,538
Please prepare
to deliver Genesis to us

450
00:33:47,621 --> 00:33:49,039
upon our arrival.

451
00:33:49,123 --> 00:33:50,124
Reliant out.

452
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:55,296
Well done, Commander.

453
00:33:55,379 --> 00:33:58,799
You realize, sir,
they will attempt

454
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:00,801
to contact Admiral Kirk

455
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:02,720
and confirm the order.

456
00:34:15,816 --> 00:34:17,234
Hold, please.

457
00:34:19,737 --> 00:34:21,155
Thank you, sir.

458
00:34:23,574 --> 00:34:24,575
Lieutenant,

459
00:34:24,575 --> 00:34:27,661
are you wearing
your hair differently?

460
00:34:27,745 --> 00:34:29,497
It's still regulation, Admiral.

461
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,084
May I speak, sir?

462
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,839
Self-expression
doesn't seem to be

463
00:34:38,923 --> 00:34:40,841
one of your problems.

464
00:34:43,844 --> 00:34:45,679
You're bothered
by your performance

465
00:34:45,763 --> 00:34:47,264
on the Kobayashi Maru.

466
00:34:47,348 --> 00:34:49,266
I failed to resolve
the situation.

467
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,768
There's no correct resolution.

468
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:52,770
It's a test
of character.

469
00:34:52,853 --> 00:34:56,315
May I ask how you
dealt with the test?

470
00:34:58,526 --> 00:35:00,236
You may ask.

471
00:35:02,363 --> 00:35:04,949
That's a little joke.

472
00:35:05,032 --> 00:35:08,702
Humor. It is
a difficult concept.

473
00:35:08,828 --> 00:35:11,789
It is not logical.

474
00:35:12,957 --> 00:35:14,125
We learn by doing.

475
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:17,169
Who's been holding up
the damn elevator?

476
00:35:17,169 --> 00:35:18,629
Thank you, sir.

477
00:35:18,712 --> 00:35:21,215
She change
her hair style?

478
00:35:21,298 --> 00:35:22,675
I hadn't noticed.

479
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,803
Wonderful stuff,
that Romulan ale.

480
00:35:25,886 --> 00:35:27,304
Admiral Kirk.

481
00:35:27,346 --> 00:35:28,722
Kirk here.

482
00:35:28,806 --> 00:35:30,724
I have
an urgent Comm-pic

483
00:35:30,808 --> 00:35:33,227
from Space Lab
Regula-1 for you.

484
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,312
Dr. Carol Marcus.

485
00:35:37,273 --> 00:35:40,401
I'll take it
in my quarters.

486
00:35:40,484 --> 00:35:43,237
It never rains
but it pours.

487
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,240
As a physician,
you should appreciate

488
00:35:46,323 --> 00:35:48,826
the dangers of reopening
old wounds.

489
00:35:51,996 --> 00:35:53,080
Sorry.

490
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:55,499
Jim, can you read me?

491
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:59,170
I can hear you, Carol.
What's wrong?

492
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:02,673
Why are you taking
Genesis from us?

493
00:36:02,673 --> 00:36:05,509
Taking Genesis?
Who's taking Genesis?

494
00:36:05,593 --> 00:36:07,428
Who is taking Genesis?

495
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:11,015
I can see you,
but I can't hear.

496
00:36:11,098 --> 00:36:13,851
Jim, did you
give the order?

497
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:16,353
What order?
Who's taking Genesis?

498
00:36:16,437 --> 00:36:18,856
I won't let them
have Genesis

499
00:36:18,981 --> 00:36:21,025
without proper authorization.

500
00:36:21,066 --> 00:36:24,195
On whose authority
can they do this?

501
00:36:24,278 --> 00:36:25,988
No one's authority.

502
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,198
Jim-

503
00:36:27,198 --> 00:36:29,033
Uhura, what's happening?

504
00:36:29,116 --> 00:36:31,535
Transmission jammed
at the source.

505
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,538
Alert Starfleet headquarters.

506
00:36:34,622 --> 00:36:36,165
Aye, sir.

507
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:39,376
I want to talk
to Starfleet command.

508
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,962
We must have order
in here.

509
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:44,381
This has to be a mistake.

510
00:36:44,465 --> 00:36:46,467
Mistake.

511
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,968
We're all alone here.

512
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:51,472
They waited until everyone
was on leave.

513
00:36:51,555 --> 00:36:54,433
Reliant is at our disposal,
not vice versa.

514
00:36:54,558 --> 00:36:56,477
I can't believe
Starfleet-

515
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,479
I tried to tell you

516
00:36:58,562 --> 00:37:01,440
scientists are always
pawns of the military.

517
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,401
Starfleet has kept peace
for 1 00 years.

518
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:07,446
I cannot subscribe
to your interpretation of this event.

519
00:37:07,446 --> 00:37:09,406
You may be right, Doctor,

520
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,908
but what about Reliant?

521
00:37:10,991 --> 00:37:12,827
She's on her way.

522
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,672
We have a problem.

523
00:37:24,672 --> 00:37:27,508
Something may be wrong
on Regula-1 .

524
00:37:27,591 --> 00:37:30,511
We've been ordered
to investigate.

525
00:37:30,594 --> 00:37:31,929
If memory serves,

526
00:37:31,971 --> 00:37:35,432
Regula-1 is a scientific
research laboratory.

527
00:37:35,516 --> 00:37:37,434
I told
Starfleet command

528
00:37:37,518 --> 00:37:40,437
all we had was
a boatload of children,

529
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:43,941
but we're the only ship
in the quadrant.

530
00:37:44,024 --> 00:37:46,443
Spock, these cadets
of yours-

531
00:37:46,527 --> 00:37:49,947
How will they respond
under real pressure?

532
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,449
As with all
living things,

533
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:54,910
each according
to his gifts.

534
00:37:55,035 --> 00:37:57,955
Of course,
the ship is yours.

535
00:37:58,038 --> 00:38:00,458
No, that won't
be necessary.

536
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:04,128
Just get me
to Regula-1 .

537
00:38:04,211 --> 00:38:07,465
As a teacher on
a training mission,

538
00:38:07,548 --> 00:38:10,468
I am content to command
the Enterprise.

539
00:38:10,551 --> 00:38:12,470
If we go on duty,

540
00:38:12,553 --> 00:38:15,222
the senior officer
must assume command.

541
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:17,975
It may be nothing.

542
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,977
Garbled communications.

543
00:38:21,562 --> 00:38:23,481
You take the ship.

544
00:38:23,564 --> 00:38:26,484
You proceed from
a false assumption.

545
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:28,527
I am a Vulcan.

546
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:30,988
I have no ego
to bruise.

547
00:38:32,656 --> 00:38:34,575
You're about
to remind me

548
00:38:34,658 --> 00:38:36,494
logic alone
dictates your actions?

549
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:38,996
I would not
remind you

550
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:41,540
of that which
you know so well.

551
00:38:41,582 --> 00:38:43,501
It was a mistake

552
00:38:43,626 --> 00:38:46,003
for you to accept
promotion.

553
00:38:46,003 --> 00:38:50,007
Commanding a starship
is your first, best destiny.

554
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:53,552
Anything else is
a waste of material.

555
00:38:53,594 --> 00:38:56,597
I would not presume
to debate you.

556
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,516
That is wise.

557
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:01,936
In any case,
were I to invoke logic,

558
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:04,939
Logic dictates that the needs
of the many

559
00:39:05,022 --> 00:39:07,441
outweigh the needs
of the few.

560
00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:10,528
Or the one.

561
00:39:16,033 --> 00:39:18,035
You're my
superior officer.

562
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:20,538
You are
also my friend.

563
00:39:20,538 --> 00:39:25,209
I have been and
always shall be yours.

564
00:39:27,545 --> 00:39:29,505
Stop the energizers.

565
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:31,549
Put me on speakers.

566
00:39:34,051 --> 00:39:36,053
An emergency situation
has arisen.

567
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:38,556
By order
of Starfleet command,

568
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:42,726
I'm assuming command
of this vessel.

569
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,437
So note in Ship's Log.

570
00:39:45,563 --> 00:39:48,399
Plot a new course
for Regula-1 .

571
00:39:48,482 --> 00:39:50,484
Mr. Scott.

572
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:51,944
Aye, sir.

573
00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:54,822
We'll be going
to warp speed.

574
00:39:54,905 --> 00:39:57,950
Course plotted
for Regula-1 , Admiral.

575
00:39:58,075 --> 00:40:00,286
Engage warp engines.

576
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:02,496
Prepare for warp speed.

577
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,998
Ready, sir.

578
00:40:04,081 --> 00:40:08,252
I know none of you
were expecting this.

579
00:40:08,335 --> 00:40:13,340
I'm asking you to grow up
sooner than you expected.

580
00:40:13,424 --> 00:40:15,509
Warp five, Sulu.

581
00:40:17,094 --> 00:40:20,264
So much for the little
training cruise.

582
00:40:28,772 --> 00:40:31,192
Course to intercept
Enterprise ready, sir.

583
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:32,943
Excellent.

584
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:34,028
Helmsman?

585
00:40:34,111 --> 00:40:36,113
Sir. May I speak?

586
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:44,538
We're all
with you, sir.

587
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,540
But consider this-

588
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:48,501
We are free.

589
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:53,047
We have the means
to go where we will.

590
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,549
We have escaped
permanent exile

591
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:57,551
on Ceti Alpha V.

592
00:40:57,635 --> 00:41:01,013
You have proved
your superior intellect

593
00:41:01,055 --> 00:41:03,974
and defeated the plans
of Admiral Kirk.

594
00:41:04,058 --> 00:41:07,978
You do not need
to defeat him again.

595
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:10,981
He tasks me.

596
00:41:11,065 --> 00:41:14,985
He tasks me,
and I shall have him.

597
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:18,989
I'll chase him
round the moons of Nibia

598
00:41:19,073 --> 00:41:22,993
and round
the Antares Maelstrom

599
00:41:23,077 --> 00:41:24,495
and round
perdition's flames

600
00:41:24,578 --> 00:41:26,997
before I give him up.

601
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:32,002
Prepare to alter course.

602
00:41:32,086 --> 00:41:35,965
Space Station Regula-1 ,
please come in.

603
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,509
Dr. Marcus,
please respond.

604
00:41:40,094 --> 00:41:42,471
This is
Enterprise call-

605
00:41:42,596 --> 00:41:44,515
It's no use.

606
00:41:44,557 --> 00:41:46,517
There's no response.

607
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,477
But no longer jammed.

608
00:41:48,602 --> 00:41:50,521
No, sir.
No nothing.

609
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,779
There are
two possibilities-

610
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:00,781
they are unable
to respond,

611
00:42:00,865 --> 00:42:02,700
they are unwilling
to respond.

612
00:42:02,783 --> 00:42:04,452
How far?

613
00:42:04,535 --> 00:42:07,496
12 hours, 43 minutes,
present speed.

614
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,959
"Give up Genesis,"
she said.

615
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:14,462
Give it up to whom?

616
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:18,466
It might help if I knew
what Genesis was,

617
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:20,509
beyond the biblical
reference.

618
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:24,472
Have Dr. McCoy
join us in my quarters.

619
00:42:24,555 --> 00:42:27,475
Mr. Saavik,
you have the con.

620
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,483
Well, I've got
sickbay ready.

621
00:42:35,566 --> 00:42:38,527
Please tell me
what's going on.

622
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:41,489
Computer, request
security procedure

623
00:42:41,572 --> 00:42:44,909
and access to
Project Genesis summary.

624
00:42:45,034 --> 00:42:48,245
Identify for retina scan.

625
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:50,498
Kirk, Admiral James T.

626
00:42:58,589 --> 00:43:01,008
Security scan approved.

627
00:43:01,091 --> 00:43:02,343
Summary, please.

628
00:43:06,013 --> 00:43:08,015
Project Genesis.

629
00:43:08,098 --> 00:43:10,684
A proposal
to the Federation.

630
00:43:10,768 --> 00:43:12,436
Carol Marcus.

631
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,771
Yes.

632
00:43:13,771 --> 00:43:15,940
What exactly is Genesis?

633
00:43:16,065 --> 00:43:17,942
Well, put simply,

634
00:43:18,025 --> 00:43:21,529
Genesis is life
from lifelessness.

635
00:43:21,529 --> 00:43:25,032
It is a process
where by molecular structure

636
00:43:25,032 --> 00:43:28,035
is reorganized
at the subatomic level

637
00:43:28,035 --> 00:43:31,539
into life-generating matter
of equal mass.

638
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:35,042
Stage One was conducted
in the laboratory.

639
00:43:35,084 --> 00:43:39,505
Stage Two will be attempted
in a lifeless underground.

640
00:43:39,547 --> 00:43:43,551
Stage Three will be processed
on a planetary scale.

641
00:43:43,634 --> 00:43:47,054
We intend to introduce
the Genesis device

642
00:43:47,054 --> 00:43:51,058
into an area
of a lifeless space body-

643
00:43:51,058 --> 00:43:54,061
a moon or other dead form.

644
00:43:54,103 --> 00:43:57,064
The device is delivered,
instantaneously causing

645
00:43:57,064 --> 00:44:00,067
what we call
the Genesis Effect.

646
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:03,487
Matter is reorganized
with life-generating results.

647
00:44:16,542 --> 00:44:20,004
Instead of a dead moon,
a living, breathing planet

648
00:44:20,087 --> 00:44:23,007
capable of sustaining
whatever life forms

649
00:44:23,048 --> 00:44:26,510
we see fit
to deposit on it.

650
00:44:26,594 --> 00:44:28,012
Fascinating.

651
00:44:28,095 --> 00:44:30,514
The reformed moon
simulated here

652
00:44:30,598 --> 00:44:32,516
represents the merest fraction

653
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,518
of the Genesis potential,

654
00:44:34,602 --> 00:44:37,521
should the Federation
fund these experiments.

655
00:44:37,605 --> 00:44:42,526
When we consider the problems
of population and food supply,

656
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:46,363
the usefulness of this process
becomes clear.

657
00:44:46,447 --> 00:44:50,034
This concludes our proposal.
Thank you.

658
00:44:50,117 --> 00:44:53,037
It literally is Genesis.

659
00:44:54,121 --> 00:44:55,706
Power of creation.

660
00:44:57,124 --> 00:44:59,543
Have they proceeded
with their experiments?

661
00:44:59,627 --> 00:45:01,962
The tape was made
last year.

662
00:45:02,046 --> 00:45:05,132
I assume they've
reached Stage Two.

663
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:09,470
Dear Lord, do you think we're
intelligent enough to...

664
00:45:09,553 --> 00:45:12,973
Suppose...
What if this were used

665
00:45:13,057 --> 00:45:15,142
where life
already exists?

666
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:16,977
It would destroy
such life

667
00:45:17,061 --> 00:45:19,730
in favor
of its new matrix.

668
00:45:19,814 --> 00:45:21,649
Its new matrix.

669
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:24,985
Do you know
what you're saying?

670
00:45:25,069 --> 00:45:28,489
I was not evaluating
its moral implications.

671
00:45:28,572 --> 00:45:31,158
As a matter
of cosmic history,

672
00:45:31,242 --> 00:45:33,577
it's been easier
to destroy

673
00:45:33,577 --> 00:45:35,079
than to create.

674
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:37,998
Not anymore.
Now we can do both simultaneously.

675
00:45:38,082 --> 00:45:42,503
According to myth,
the earth was created in six days.

676
00:45:42,586 --> 00:45:45,756
Now Genesis will do it
in six minutes.

677
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,260
Really, Dr. McCoy, you must
govern your passions.

678
00:45:49,343 --> 00:45:51,762
They will be
your undoing.

679
00:45:51,846 --> 00:45:53,931
Logic suggests-

680
00:45:54,014 --> 00:45:57,601
My God, the man's
talking about logic.

681
00:45:57,685 --> 00:46:00,104
We're talking about
universal Armageddon.

682
00:46:00,187 --> 00:46:02,940
You green-blooded,
inhuman-

683
00:46:03,023 --> 00:46:06,777
Admiral, sensors indicate
a vessel in our area

684
00:46:06,861 --> 00:46:08,445
closing fast.

685
00:46:08,445 --> 00:46:10,948
What do you
make of her?

686
00:46:10,948 --> 00:46:12,950
It's one of ours.
It's Reliant.

687
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,118
Reliant?

688
00:46:17,121 --> 00:46:19,206
Try the emergency channels.

689
00:46:23,461 --> 00:46:25,629
Picture, Mr. Saavik.

690
00:46:41,562 --> 00:46:44,482
Slow to 1/2 impulse power.

691
00:46:44,565 --> 00:46:46,984
Let's be friends.

692
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:50,154
Slowing to 1/2
impulse power.

693
00:46:50,237 --> 00:46:51,655
Reliant
in our section.

694
00:46:51,739 --> 00:46:54,492
This quadrant, sir,
and slowing.

695
00:46:54,575 --> 00:46:57,495
Sir, may I quote
general order 1 2?

696
00:46:57,578 --> 00:47:00,498
"When communications
have not been established-"

697
00:47:00,581 --> 00:47:02,917
The Admiral is well aware

698
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,919
of the regulations.

699
00:47:05,002 --> 00:47:06,921
Aye, sir.

700
00:47:10,508 --> 00:47:13,427
Could their Comm system
have failed?

701
00:47:13,511 --> 00:47:16,430
It would explain
many things.

702
00:47:16,514 --> 00:47:18,933
They're requesting
communication, sir.

703
00:47:19,016 --> 00:47:21,602
Let them eat static.

704
00:47:21,685 --> 00:47:26,190
They're still running
with shields down.

705
00:47:26,273 --> 00:47:27,441
Of course.

706
00:47:27,525 --> 00:47:30,444
We are one big happy fleet.

707
00:47:30,528 --> 00:47:34,448
Ah, Kirk,
my old friend.

708
00:47:34,532 --> 00:47:37,451
Do you know
the Klingon proverb

709
00:47:37,535 --> 00:47:40,955
that tells us
revenge is a dish

710
00:47:41,038 --> 00:47:43,457
that is best served cold?

711
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:49,213
It is very cold in space.

712
00:47:58,973 --> 00:48:00,474
This is damn peculiar.

713
00:48:02,726 --> 00:48:03,727
Yellow alert.

714
00:48:03,811 --> 00:48:05,396
Energize defense fields.

715
00:48:11,652 --> 00:48:13,404
I'm getting
a voice message.

716
00:48:13,487 --> 00:48:17,491
Their chambers coil is overloading
their Comm system.

717
00:48:17,575 --> 00:48:18,492
Spock?

718
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:19,660
Scanning.

719
00:48:19,743 --> 00:48:21,579
Their coil emissions
are normal.

720
00:48:24,582 --> 00:48:26,750
They still haven't raised
their shields.

721
00:48:26,834 --> 00:48:28,252
Raise ours.

722
00:48:30,671 --> 00:48:31,839
Shields going up.

723
00:48:31,922 --> 00:48:33,757
Lock phasers on target.

724
00:48:33,757 --> 00:48:36,594
Locking phasers
on target.

725
00:48:36,677 --> 00:48:37,678
Locking phasers.

726
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:38,679
Raise shields.

727
00:48:38,762 --> 00:48:39,680
Fire!

728
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,275
Aah!

729
00:48:54,945 --> 00:48:56,113
Get those shields up!

730
00:48:56,197 --> 00:48:57,114
Trying, sir.

731
00:49:20,137 --> 00:49:21,722
I can't get power.

732
00:49:23,808 --> 00:49:24,809
Scotty!

733
00:49:26,393 --> 00:49:27,561
Get off those channels!

734
00:49:27,645 --> 00:49:29,313
Mr. Scott
on the screen.

735
00:49:29,396 --> 00:49:32,399
I'm just
hanging on, sir.

736
00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:34,401
The main energizer's out.

737
00:49:34,485 --> 00:49:36,487
Try auxiliary power.

738
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:37,822
Aye, aye, sir.

739
00:49:37,905 --> 00:49:38,906
Damage report.

740
00:49:45,496 --> 00:49:48,415
They knew exactly
where to hit us.

741
00:49:48,499 --> 00:49:51,418
Who? Who knew where
to hit us? And why?

742
00:49:51,502 --> 00:49:53,003
One thing is certain.

743
00:49:53,087 --> 00:49:55,506
We cannot escape
on auxiliary power.

744
00:49:57,591 --> 00:49:58,509
Visual.

745
00:50:01,262 --> 00:50:02,680
Sulu, divert power
to phasers.

746
00:50:02,763 --> 00:50:03,848
Too late.

747
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:05,266
Hang on!

748
00:50:16,527 --> 00:50:18,362
Scotty, what's left?

749
00:50:18,446 --> 00:50:19,864
Just the battery, sir.

750
00:50:19,947 --> 00:50:22,867
I can have auxiliary power
in a few minutes.

751
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:25,369
We don't have
a few minutes!

752
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:32,543
Can you give me
phaser power?

753
00:50:32,626 --> 00:50:34,295
A few shots, sir.

754
00:50:34,295 --> 00:50:36,130
Not enough against
their shields.

755
00:50:36,213 --> 00:50:37,631
Who the hell are they?

756
00:50:37,715 --> 00:50:40,384
Admiral, the Reliant's
commander is signaling.

757
00:50:40,468 --> 00:50:42,970
He wishes to discuss
terms of our surrender.

758
00:50:51,896 --> 00:50:54,148
Put it on screen.

759
00:50:54,231 --> 00:50:55,149
Admiral.

760
00:50:55,232 --> 00:50:56,984
Do it!

761
00:50:57,067 --> 00:50:58,986
While we still have time.

762
00:51:04,742 --> 00:51:06,160
On screen, sir.

763
00:51:14,752 --> 00:51:15,669
Khan.

764
00:51:15,753 --> 00:51:18,923
You still remember, Admiral.

765
00:51:19,006 --> 00:51:21,842
I cannot help
but be touched.

766
00:51:21,926 --> 00:51:24,428
I, of course,
remember you.

767
00:51:24,512 --> 00:51:26,847
What's the meaning
of this attack?

768
00:51:26,931 --> 00:51:28,849
Where's the crew
of the Reliant?

769
00:51:28,933 --> 00:51:32,353
Surely, I have made
my meaning plain.

770
00:51:32,436 --> 00:51:36,106
I mean to avenge myself
upon you, Admiral.

771
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,108
I deprived your ship
of power,

772
00:51:38,192 --> 00:51:39,610
and when I swing around,

773
00:51:39,693 --> 00:51:43,030
I mean to deprive you
of your life.

774
00:51:43,114 --> 00:51:45,533
But I wanted you
to know first

775
00:51:45,616 --> 00:51:48,202
who it was
who had beaten you.

776
00:51:49,787 --> 00:51:50,704
Khan...

777
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,626
if it's me you want,

778
00:51:55,709 --> 00:51:58,212
I'll have myself
beamed aboard.

779
00:51:58,295 --> 00:51:59,797
Spare my crew.

780
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,550
I make you
a counterproposal.

781
00:52:02,633 --> 00:52:05,302
I'll agree
to your terms if...

782
00:52:05,386 --> 00:52:06,720
if...

783
00:52:06,804 --> 00:52:08,222
in addition
to yourself,

784
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:12,726
you hand over to me
all data and material

785
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:15,896
regarding the project
called Genesis.

786
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,565
Genesis? What's that?

787
00:52:17,648 --> 00:52:20,484
Don't insult
my intelligence, Kirk.

788
00:52:20,568 --> 00:52:23,904
Give me time to recall
the data on our computers.

789
00:52:23,988 --> 00:52:27,158
I give you
60 seconds, Admiral.

790
00:52:33,581 --> 00:52:34,999
Clear the bridge.

791
00:52:40,504 --> 00:52:43,757
At least we know he doesn't
have Genesis.

792
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:46,760
Keep nodding as though
I'm still giving orders.

793
00:52:46,844 --> 00:52:49,263
Mr. Saavik,
punch up the data charts

794
00:52:49,346 --> 00:52:50,681
of Reliant's
command console.

795
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:52,183
Reliant's Command?

796
00:52:52,266 --> 00:52:53,184
Hurry.

797
00:52:53,267 --> 00:52:54,518
The prefix code?

798
00:52:54,602 --> 00:52:55,603
It's all we've got.

799
00:53:02,026 --> 00:53:03,444
Chart's up, sir.

800
00:53:03,527 --> 00:53:04,445
Admiral.

801
00:53:04,528 --> 00:53:05,946
We're finding it.

802
00:53:07,948 --> 00:53:09,033
Admiral.

803
00:53:09,116 --> 00:53:12,036
Please. Please,
you've got to give us time.

804
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:13,621
The bridge is smashed.

805
00:53:13,621 --> 00:53:15,122
The computer's inoperative.

806
00:53:15,122 --> 00:53:17,708
Time is a luxury
you don't have, Admiral.

807
00:53:25,299 --> 00:53:26,383
Damn!

808
00:53:27,802 --> 00:53:28,719
Admiral?

809
00:53:28,803 --> 00:53:30,805
It's coming through
now, Khan.

810
00:53:35,142 --> 00:53:38,312
Reliant's prefix number
is 1 6309.

811
00:53:38,395 --> 00:53:39,814
I don't understand.

812
00:53:39,897 --> 00:53:42,817
You have to learn why things work
on a starship.

813
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,820
Each ship has its own
combination code...

814
00:53:45,903 --> 00:53:50,157
to prevent an enemy from doing
what we're attempting.

815
00:53:50,241 --> 00:53:52,076
We're using
our console

816
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:55,079
to order Reliant
to lower her shields.

817
00:53:55,162 --> 00:53:57,081
Assuming he hasn't changed
the combination.

818
00:53:57,164 --> 00:53:58,666
He's quite intelligent.

819
00:53:58,749 --> 00:54:00,584
1 5 seconds, Admiral.

820
00:54:05,089 --> 00:54:08,008
Khan, how do we know
you'll keep your word?

821
00:54:08,092 --> 00:54:11,011
I've given you
no word to keep, Admiral.

822
00:54:11,095 --> 00:54:14,348
In my judgment,
you simply have no alternative.

823
00:54:17,601 --> 00:54:19,019
I see your point.

824
00:54:20,354 --> 00:54:22,773
Stand by to receive
our transmission.

825
00:54:23,858 --> 00:54:26,360
Mr. Sulu,
lock phasers on target

826
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,862
and await my command.

827
00:54:27,945 --> 00:54:29,196
Phasers locked.

828
00:54:30,448 --> 00:54:33,284
Time's up, Admiral.

829
00:54:33,367 --> 00:54:35,536
Here it comes.

830
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:37,037
Now, Mr. Spock.

831
00:54:43,878 --> 00:54:46,046
Sir, our shields are dropping.

832
00:54:48,132 --> 00:54:49,049
Raise them!

833
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:51,802
I can't!

834
00:54:54,221 --> 00:54:56,474
Where's the override?
The override?

835
00:54:56,557 --> 00:54:57,808
Fire!

836
00:55:00,394 --> 00:55:01,645
Fire!

837
00:55:06,066 --> 00:55:07,485
Fire!

838
00:55:07,485 --> 00:55:08,486
Fire!

839
00:55:08,486 --> 00:55:09,987
We can't, sir!

840
00:55:09,987 --> 00:55:11,489
Why can't you?

841
00:55:11,489 --> 00:55:14,241
They've damaged the photon control
and the warp drive.

842
00:55:14,325 --> 00:55:15,743
We must withdraw!

843
00:55:15,826 --> 00:55:16,827
No! No!

844
00:55:16,911 --> 00:55:17,828
We must!

845
00:55:24,668 --> 00:55:26,337
Enterprise will wait.

846
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,006
She's not
going anywhere.

847
00:55:37,014 --> 00:55:38,516
Sir, you did it.

848
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:41,435
I did nothing...

849
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:44,438
except get caught
with my britches down.

850
00:55:44,522 --> 00:55:46,440
I must be
getting senile.

851
00:55:46,524 --> 00:55:51,028
Mr. Saavik, you go right
on quoting regulations.

852
00:55:51,112 --> 00:55:52,530
Meantime, let's find out

853
00:55:52,613 --> 00:55:54,532
how badly
we've been hurt.

854
00:56:42,413 --> 00:56:44,415
Is the word given, Admiral?

855
00:56:44,415 --> 00:56:45,916
The word is given.

856
00:56:47,918 --> 00:56:49,003
Warp speed.

857
00:56:51,755 --> 00:56:52,673
Aye.

858
00:57:07,021 --> 00:57:11,358
He stayed at his post
when the trainees ran.

859
00:57:11,442 --> 00:57:13,027
Admiral, this is Spock.

860
00:57:14,195 --> 00:57:15,446
Yes, Spock.

861
00:57:15,446 --> 00:57:18,449
Engine room reports
auxiliary power restored.

862
00:57:18,449 --> 00:57:20,951
We can proceed
at impulse power.

863
00:57:21,035 --> 00:57:24,038
Best speed to Regula-1 .
Kirk out.

864
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:25,539
I'm sorry, Scotty.

865
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:31,295
Approaching Regula
at Space Lab Regula-1.

866
00:57:31,378 --> 00:57:32,797
Space Station Regula-1,

867
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,632
this is
the starship Enterprise.

868
00:57:34,715 --> 00:57:36,133
Please come in.

869
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,640
Space Station Regula-1,
do you read?

870
00:57:44,975 --> 00:57:47,895
Space Station Regula-1,
this is Enterprise.

871
00:57:47,978 --> 00:57:49,146
Please acknowledge.

872
00:57:51,232 --> 00:57:54,151
This is Enterprise.
Do you read me?

873
00:57:56,237 --> 00:57:59,657
Space Station Regula-1 ,
do you read?

874
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:01,408
Please come in.

875
00:58:01,492 --> 00:58:02,910
There's no response, sir.

876
00:58:06,497 --> 00:58:07,498
Sensors, Captain.

877
00:58:07,581 --> 00:58:09,500
Scanners and sensors
are still inoperative.

878
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:12,503
There's no way to ascertain
what's inside the station.

879
00:58:12,586 --> 00:58:16,006
No way of telling
if Reliant is still in the area.

880
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:17,091
Precisely.

881
00:58:17,174 --> 00:58:20,010
What do you make
of that planetoid beyond?

882
00:58:20,094 --> 00:58:22,513
Regula is Class D.

883
00:58:22,596 --> 00:58:25,766
It consists of various
unremarkable ores,

884
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:27,768
essentially
a great rock in space.

885
00:58:27,852 --> 00:58:30,271
And Reliant could be hiding
behind that rock.

886
00:58:30,354 --> 00:58:31,939
A distinct possibility.

887
00:58:34,108 --> 00:58:35,109
Engineering.

888
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:36,444
Aye, sir.

889
00:58:36,527 --> 00:58:40,281
Mr. Scott, do you have enough power
for transporters?

890
00:58:40,364 --> 00:58:41,782
Barely, sir.

891
00:58:43,784 --> 00:58:45,286
I'm going down there.

892
00:58:45,286 --> 00:58:46,787
Khan could be
down there.

893
00:58:46,787 --> 00:58:49,290
He's been there.
Can you spare someone?

894
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:50,791
There may be people hurt.

895
00:58:50,791 --> 00:58:52,293
Yeah. I can spare me.

896
00:58:52,293 --> 00:58:53,794
Begging the Admiral's pardon.

897
00:58:53,794 --> 00:58:55,296
General order 1 5.

898
00:58:55,296 --> 00:58:57,798
"No flag officer shall beam
into a hazardous area

899
00:58:57,798 --> 00:58:59,300
without armed escort."

900
00:58:59,383 --> 00:59:00,885
There's no such regulation.

901
00:59:05,473 --> 00:59:06,891
All right.
Join the party.

902
00:59:06,974 --> 00:59:08,392
Mr. Spock,
the ship is yours.

903
00:59:08,476 --> 00:59:10,644
Jim, be careful.

904
00:59:11,729 --> 00:59:12,730
We will.

905
00:59:36,754 --> 00:59:38,422
Indeterminate life signs.

906
00:59:42,259 --> 00:59:43,677
Phasers on stun.

907
00:59:47,681 --> 00:59:48,599
Move out.

908
01:00:51,078 --> 01:00:51,996
Aah.

909
01:00:54,081 --> 01:00:54,999
Jim!

910
01:01:05,676 --> 01:01:07,511
Well, rigor hasn't set in.

911
01:01:07,595 --> 01:01:10,598
This couldn't have happened
too long ago, Jim.

912
01:01:10,681 --> 01:01:11,932
Carol.

913
01:01:12,016 --> 01:01:14,935
This is Enterprise
calling Space Lab Regula-1 .

914
01:01:15,019 --> 01:01:16,020
Respond, please.

915
01:01:16,103 --> 01:01:19,106
Admiral. Over here.

916
01:01:19,106 --> 01:01:21,358
Dr. Marcus,
come in, please.

917
01:01:46,217 --> 01:01:47,635
Oh, my God.

918
01:01:47,718 --> 01:01:49,637
Please acknowledge signal.
Please-

919
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:52,640
Commander Uhura,
this is Lieutenant Saavik.

920
01:01:52,723 --> 01:01:56,644
We're all right.
Please standby. Out.

921
01:01:57,394 --> 01:02:00,397
Oh, sir,
it was Khan.

922
01:02:00,481 --> 01:02:03,400
We found him
on Ceti Alpha V.

923
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,401
Easy. Easy.

924
01:02:04,401 --> 01:02:05,402
He...

925
01:02:05,402 --> 01:02:10,407
he put creatures
in our bodies

926
01:02:10,491 --> 01:02:13,327
to control our minds.

927
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:16,330
It's all right.
You're safe now.

928
01:02:16,413 --> 01:02:18,332
Made us say lies...

929
01:02:18,415 --> 01:02:19,834
do things...

930
01:02:19,917 --> 01:02:21,836
but we beat him.

931
01:02:21,919 --> 01:02:26,340
He thought he controlled us,
but he did not.

932
01:02:26,423 --> 01:02:27,842
The Captain was strong.

933
01:02:27,925 --> 01:02:28,926
Captain...

934
01:02:30,094 --> 01:02:31,512
where's Dr. Marcus?

935
01:02:33,013 --> 01:02:34,932
Where are the
Genesis materials?

936
01:02:35,015 --> 01:02:36,433
He couldn't find them.

937
01:02:36,517 --> 01:02:38,936
Even the data banks
were empty.

938
01:02:39,019 --> 01:02:40,354
Erased?

939
01:02:40,437 --> 01:02:42,356
He tortured
those people.

940
01:02:42,439 --> 01:02:45,359
But none of them
would tell him anything.

941
01:02:45,443 --> 01:02:47,361
He went wild.

942
01:02:47,445 --> 01:02:49,363
He slit their throats.

943
01:02:49,447 --> 01:02:53,868
He wanted to tear the place apart,
but he was late.

944
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:56,370
He had to get back
to the Reliant

945
01:02:56,454 --> 01:02:58,873
in time
to blow you to bits.

946
01:02:58,956 --> 01:03:01,459
Where's Reliant's crew? Dead?

947
01:03:03,544 --> 01:03:05,713
Marooned
on Ceti Alpha V.

948
01:03:05,796 --> 01:03:07,214
He's completely
mad, Admiral.

949
01:03:07,298 --> 01:03:10,217
He blames you for the death
of his wife.

950
01:03:10,301 --> 01:03:13,220
I know what
he blames me for.

951
01:03:16,974 --> 01:03:19,894
The escape pods
are all in place.

952
01:03:21,061 --> 01:03:23,230
Where's the transporter room?

953
01:03:23,314 --> 01:03:25,816
Did he make it
down here?

954
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,318
It was not
my impression.

955
01:03:27,401 --> 01:03:29,320
He spent most
of his time

956
01:03:29,403 --> 01:03:32,323
trying to wring the information
out of the people.

957
01:03:32,406 --> 01:03:33,324
Anything?

958
01:03:33,407 --> 01:03:35,326
The unit's been left on,

959
01:03:35,409 --> 01:03:38,245
which means nobody remained
to turn it off.

960
01:03:38,329 --> 01:03:39,747
Those people back there

961
01:03:39,830 --> 01:03:42,833
bought escape time for Genesis
with their lives.

962
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:44,835
This is not logical.

963
01:03:44,919 --> 01:03:47,338
These coordinates
are deep inside Regula,

964
01:03:47,421 --> 01:03:49,840
a planetoid we know
to be lifeless.

965
01:03:51,926 --> 01:03:53,928
If Stage Two
is completed,

966
01:03:53,928 --> 01:03:55,930
it was going
to be underground.

967
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:58,933
It was going to be
underground, she said.

968
01:03:59,016 --> 01:04:00,434
Stage Two of what?

969
01:04:02,019 --> 01:04:03,270
Kirk to Enterprise.

970
01:04:03,354 --> 01:04:04,438
Spock here.

971
01:04:04,522 --> 01:04:06,524
Captain Spock,
damage report.

972
01:04:06,524 --> 01:04:09,527
Admiral,
if we go by the book,

973
01:04:09,527 --> 01:04:11,028
like Lieutenant Saavik,

974
01:04:11,028 --> 01:04:13,197
hours could seem
like days.

975
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,200
I read you, Captain.
Let's have it.

976
01:04:16,283 --> 01:04:18,202
The situation
is grave, Admiral.

977
01:04:18,285 --> 01:04:21,205
We won't have main power
for six days.

978
01:04:21,288 --> 01:04:23,707
Auxiliary power
has temporarily failed.

979
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:26,961
Restoration maybe possible
in two days.

980
01:04:27,044 --> 01:04:28,546
By the book, Admiral.

981
01:04:28,546 --> 01:04:31,549
Meaning you can't
even beam us back?

982
01:04:31,549 --> 01:04:33,050
Not at present.

983
01:04:35,553 --> 01:04:36,637
Captain Spock...

984
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,557
if you don't hear from us
within one hour,

985
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,643
your orders are to restore
what power you can,

986
01:04:42,726 --> 01:04:45,646
take the Enterprise to the nearest
star base,

987
01:04:45,729 --> 01:04:48,065
and alert
Starfleet command.

988
01:04:48,149 --> 01:04:50,067
Sir, we won't
leave you behind.

989
01:04:50,151 --> 01:04:52,570
Uhura, if you don't
hear from us,

990
01:04:52,653 --> 01:04:56,073
there won't be anybody behind.
Kirk out.

991
01:04:56,157 --> 01:04:59,076
Well, gentlemen,
you can stay here, or...

992
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,078
If it's all the same,
Admiral,

993
01:05:01,162 --> 01:05:03,914
we'd like
to share the risk.

994
01:05:03,998 --> 01:05:05,916
Right. Let's go.

995
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:06,917
Saavik?

996
01:05:08,169 --> 01:05:10,087
Go? Where are we going?

997
01:05:10,171 --> 01:05:11,589
Where they went.

998
01:05:13,674 --> 01:05:15,759
Suppose they went nowhere?

999
01:05:15,759 --> 01:05:18,762
Then this will be
your big chance

1000
01:05:18,762 --> 01:05:21,265
to get away
from it all.

1001
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:50,127
Admiral.

1002
01:06:04,725 --> 01:06:06,310
Genesis, I presume.

1003
01:06:14,735 --> 01:06:16,237
Phasers down!

1004
01:06:17,655 --> 01:06:18,906
You!

1005
01:06:26,747 --> 01:06:28,165
Where's Dr. Marcus?

1006
01:06:28,249 --> 01:06:29,667
I'm Dr. Marcus.

1007
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:30,668
Jim!

1008
01:06:43,848 --> 01:06:45,266
Is that David?

1009
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:49,186
Mother, he killed everybody
we left behind.

1010
01:06:50,688 --> 01:06:53,190
Oh, of course he didn't.

1011
01:06:53,274 --> 01:06:55,693
David, you're just
making this harder.

1012
01:06:55,776 --> 01:06:57,695
I'm afraid
it's even harder

1013
01:06:57,778 --> 01:06:59,447
than you think, Doctor.

1014
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:01,031
Please...

1015
01:07:01,115 --> 01:07:02,616
don't move.

1016
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,784
Chekov?

1017
01:07:03,868 --> 01:07:06,287
I'm...

1018
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:07,621
sorry, Admiral.

1019
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:11,959
Your Excellency,
have you been listening?

1020
01:07:15,379 --> 01:07:18,215
I have indeed, Captain.

1021
01:07:18,299 --> 01:07:19,550
You have done well.

1022
01:07:19,633 --> 01:07:22,553
I knew it.
You son of a bitch!

1023
01:07:24,388 --> 01:07:25,806
Don't move, anybody!

1024
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:27,141
Captain?

1025
01:07:27,224 --> 01:07:28,976
We are waiting.

1026
01:07:29,059 --> 01:07:30,978
What's the delay?

1027
01:07:31,061 --> 01:07:32,480
All is well, sir.

1028
01:07:32,563 --> 01:07:35,149
You have the coordinates
to beam up Genesis.

1029
01:07:37,318 --> 01:07:40,488
First things first, Captain.

1030
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:45,409
Kill Admiral Kirk.

1031
01:07:55,753 --> 01:07:58,422
Sir, it is difficult. I...

1032
01:07:58,506 --> 01:08:00,424
I try to obey, but...

1033
01:08:00,508 --> 01:08:02,092
Kill him.

1034
01:08:02,176 --> 01:08:03,344
I...

1035
01:08:05,262 --> 01:08:06,180
Aah!

1036
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:13,854
Kill him, Terrell, now!

1037
01:08:18,943 --> 01:08:20,194
Aah!

1038
01:08:25,116 --> 01:08:27,118
Aah!

1039
01:08:37,294 --> 01:08:38,629
God sakes!

1040
01:08:40,798 --> 01:08:42,216
What is it?

1041
01:09:02,653 --> 01:09:04,238
Khan, you bloodsucker!

1042
01:09:04,321 --> 01:09:07,074
You'll have to do
your own dirty work now.

1043
01:09:07,074 --> 01:09:09,577
Do you hear me?
Do you?

1044
01:09:11,412 --> 01:09:12,580
Kirk.

1045
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:19,086
Kirk, you're still alive,
my old friend.

1046
01:09:19,086 --> 01:09:23,090
Still, "old friend."

1047
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:26,093
You've managed to kill just about
everyone else.

1048
01:09:26,093 --> 01:09:28,095
But like
a poor marksman,

1049
01:09:28,095 --> 01:09:30,347
you keep missing
the target!

1050
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:42,610
Perhaps I no longer
need to try, Admiral.

1051
01:09:48,783 --> 01:09:49,700
Oh, no!

1052
01:09:49,784 --> 01:09:51,202
They can't take it.

1053
01:09:54,205 --> 01:09:55,122
Khan?

1054
01:10:00,711 --> 01:10:02,463
Khan, you've got Genesis,

1055
01:10:02,546 --> 01:10:03,881
but you don't
have me.

1056
01:10:03,964 --> 01:10:06,383
If you're going
to kill me, Khan,

1057
01:10:06,467 --> 01:10:09,887
you're going to have to
come down here!

1058
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:12,973
I've done far worse
than kill you.

1059
01:10:15,643 --> 01:10:18,562
I've hurt you,

1060
01:10:18,646 --> 01:10:22,483
and I wish to go on
hurting you.

1061
01:10:24,819 --> 01:10:27,738
I shall leave you
as you left me-

1062
01:10:27,822 --> 01:10:30,157
as you left her-

1063
01:10:30,241 --> 01:10:32,409
marooned for all eternity

1064
01:10:32,409 --> 01:10:35,663
in the center
of a dead planet.

1065
01:10:37,164 --> 01:10:39,166
Buried alive.

1066
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:42,336
Buried alive.

1067
01:10:42,419 --> 01:10:44,088
Khan!

1068
01:10:45,339 --> 01:10:47,800
Khan!

1069
01:10:53,264 --> 01:10:55,516
This is Lieutenant Saavik
calling Enterprise.

1070
01:10:55,641 --> 01:10:57,768
Can you read us?

1071
01:10:57,852 --> 01:10:59,812
This is Lieutenant Saavik.
Calling Enterprise.

1072
01:10:59,854 --> 01:11:01,272
Can you read us?

1073
01:11:01,397 --> 01:11:02,773
He's coming around.

1074
01:11:02,773 --> 01:11:04,608
Can you read us?

1075
01:11:06,944 --> 01:11:08,737
It's no use, Admiral.

1076
01:11:08,779 --> 01:11:11,031
They're still jamming
all channels.

1077
01:11:11,115 --> 01:11:14,034
If the Enterprise followed orders,
she's long since gone.

1078
01:11:14,118 --> 01:11:17,204
If she couldn't obey,
she's finished.

1079
01:11:17,288 --> 01:11:19,707
So are we,
it looks like.

1080
01:11:21,292 --> 01:11:24,211
I don't understand.
Who's responsible for all this?

1081
01:11:25,629 --> 01:11:27,047
Who is Khan?

1082
01:11:27,131 --> 01:11:29,049
Well, it's a long story.

1083
01:11:29,133 --> 01:11:31,594
We appear to have
plenty of time.

1084
01:11:34,805 --> 01:11:36,724
Is there
anything to eat?

1085
01:11:36,849 --> 01:11:39,727
I don't know about anybody else,
but I'm starved.

1086
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:43,230
How can you think of food
at a time like this?

1087
01:11:43,314 --> 01:11:45,566
First order
of business-survival.

1088
01:11:45,649 --> 01:11:48,569
There is food
in the Genesis cave,

1089
01:11:48,652 --> 01:11:51,071
enough to last
a lifetime...

1090
01:11:52,072 --> 01:11:54,033
if necessary.

1091
01:11:54,074 --> 01:11:55,993
We thought
this was Genesis.

1092
01:11:56,076 --> 01:11:57,077
This?

1093
01:11:59,413 --> 01:12:02,333
It took the Starfleet
corps of engineers

1094
01:12:02,374 --> 01:12:06,337
1 0 months in space suits
to tunnel out all this.

1095
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:10,007
What we did in there,
we did in a day.

1096
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:13,260
David, why don't you show

1097
01:12:13,302 --> 01:12:14,762
Dr. McCoy
and the lieutenant

1098
01:12:14,762 --> 01:12:16,263
our idea of food?

1099
01:12:16,263 --> 01:12:18,182
We can't just sit here.

1100
01:12:20,017 --> 01:12:21,435
Oh, yes, we can.

1101
01:12:21,519 --> 01:12:25,940
This is just to give us
something to do, isn't it?

1102
01:12:27,441 --> 01:12:28,442
Come on.

1103
01:12:36,283 --> 01:12:37,326
Admiral?

1104
01:12:38,786 --> 01:12:42,206
As your teacher Mr. Spock
is fond to say,

1105
01:12:42,289 --> 01:12:45,668
I like to think that there always
are possibilities.

1106
01:12:57,304 --> 01:12:59,723
I did what you wanted.

1107
01:12:59,765 --> 01:13:01,225
I stayed away.

1108
01:13:02,977 --> 01:13:04,937
Why didn't you tell him?

1109
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:09,817
How can you
ask me that?

1110
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,319
Were we together?

1111
01:13:12,403 --> 01:13:14,738
Were we going to be?

1112
01:13:14,864 --> 01:13:17,908
You had your world,
and I had mine.

1113
01:13:19,034 --> 01:13:21,495
And I wanted him in mine,

1114
01:13:21,579 --> 01:13:24,498
not chasing through the universe
with his father.

1115
01:13:35,259 --> 01:13:36,260
Actually...

1116
01:13:38,012 --> 01:13:40,014
he's a lot like you...

1117
01:13:40,097 --> 01:13:41,974
in many ways.

1118
01:13:44,935 --> 01:13:47,354
Please tell me
what you're feeling.

1119
01:13:51,776 --> 01:13:56,197
There's a man out there
I haven't seen in 1 5 years

1120
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,656
who's trying to kill me.

1121
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:03,621
You show me a son
that would be happy to help.

1122
01:14:05,289 --> 01:14:06,624
My son.

1123
01:14:11,045 --> 01:14:14,131
My life that
could have been...

1124
01:14:14,256 --> 01:14:15,633
and wasn't.

1125
01:14:18,969 --> 01:14:20,387
What am I feeling?

1126
01:14:24,767 --> 01:14:25,810
Old.

1127
01:14:29,647 --> 01:14:30,648
Worn-out.

1128
01:14:37,905 --> 01:14:41,075
Let me show you something

1129
01:14:41,158 --> 01:14:44,161
that will
make you feel young

1130
01:14:44,245 --> 01:14:46,622
as when the world
was new.

1131
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,512
Impulse power restored.

1132
01:15:02,805 --> 01:15:04,849
Excellent.

1133
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:07,852
More than a match
for poor Enterprise.

1134
01:15:28,831 --> 01:15:31,792
You did all this
in a day?

1135
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:34,587
The matrix formed
in a day.

1136
01:15:34,628 --> 01:15:36,547
The life forms
grew later

1137
01:15:36,672 --> 01:15:39,800
at a substantially
accelerated rate.

1138
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:45,973
Jim! This is incredible!

1139
01:15:46,015 --> 01:15:48,476
Have you ever
seen the like?

1140
01:15:50,311 --> 01:15:52,855
Can I cook
or can't l?

1141
01:16:11,582 --> 01:16:13,167
Where is she?

1142
01:16:18,589 --> 01:16:21,550
Sir, may I ask you
a question?

1143
01:16:21,592 --> 01:16:23,052
What's on your mind?

1144
01:16:23,093 --> 01:16:25,012
The Kobayashi Maru, sir.

1145
01:16:25,137 --> 01:16:27,598
You're asking if we're playing out
that scenario?

1146
01:16:27,598 --> 01:16:29,099
On the test, sir.

1147
01:16:29,099 --> 01:16:32,019
Will you tell me
what you did?

1148
01:16:32,103 --> 01:16:34,021
I would really like
to know.

1149
01:16:34,105 --> 01:16:38,442
Lieutenant, you're looking
at the only Starfleet cadet

1150
01:16:38,526 --> 01:16:41,445
who ever beat
the no-win scenario.

1151
01:16:41,529 --> 01:16:42,780
How?

1152
01:16:42,822 --> 01:16:44,281
I reprogrammed
the simulation

1153
01:16:44,365 --> 01:16:46,951
so it was possible
to rescue the ship.

1154
01:16:47,034 --> 01:16:48,619
What?

1155
01:16:48,661 --> 01:16:50,287
He cheated.

1156
01:16:50,371 --> 01:16:53,290
Changed the conditions
of the test.

1157
01:16:53,332 --> 01:16:56,127
Got a commendation
for original thinking.

1158
01:16:56,210 --> 01:16:58,212
I don't like to lose.

1159
01:16:58,212 --> 01:17:01,215
Then you never faced
that situation...

1160
01:17:01,298 --> 01:17:02,299
faced death.

1161
01:17:02,383 --> 01:17:05,219
I don't believe
in the no-win scenario.

1162
01:17:07,054 --> 01:17:08,472
Kirk to Spock.

1163
01:17:08,556 --> 01:17:10,516
It's two hours.
Are you ready?

1164
01:17:10,516 --> 01:17:13,644
Right on schedule.
Just give us your coordinates,

1165
01:17:13,686 --> 01:17:15,146
and we'll
beam you aboard.

1166
01:17:15,187 --> 01:17:16,147
All right.

1167
01:17:19,859 --> 01:17:21,735
I don't like to lose.

1168
01:17:21,735 --> 01:17:23,237
We were immobilized.

1169
01:17:23,237 --> 01:17:26,073
Captain Spock said
it would be two days.

1170
01:17:26,115 --> 01:17:27,575
You go by the book.

1171
01:17:27,575 --> 01:17:29,076
Spock, you know Dr. Marcus.

1172
01:17:29,076 --> 01:17:30,077
Of course.

1173
01:17:30,077 --> 01:17:31,579
Hello, Mr. Spock.

1174
01:17:31,579 --> 01:17:32,997
I'm taking them
to sickbay.

1175
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,498
By the book?

1176
01:17:34,582 --> 01:17:37,126
By the book.
Regulation 46a-

1177
01:17:37,251 --> 01:17:40,254
"If transmissions are being
monitored during battle...

1178
01:17:40,337 --> 01:17:42,798
no uncoded messages
on an open channel."

1179
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:46,969
You lied.

1180
01:17:48,345 --> 01:17:49,263
I exaggerated.

1181
01:17:49,346 --> 01:17:50,931
Hours instead of days.

1182
01:17:51,015 --> 01:17:53,934
Now we have minutes
instead of hours.

1183
01:17:57,188 --> 01:17:58,606
They're inoperative
below C-Deck.

1184
01:17:58,689 --> 01:18:00,107
What is working
around here?

1185
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:02,651
Not much, Admiral.
We have partial main power.

1186
01:18:02,651 --> 01:18:03,527
That's it?

1187
01:18:03,652 --> 01:18:05,780
Best we can do
in two hours.

1188
01:18:24,215 --> 01:18:25,966
Admiral on the bridge.

1189
01:18:26,091 --> 01:18:26,967
Battle stations.

1190
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:30,971
Tactical.

1191
01:18:33,557 --> 01:18:34,558
Uh-oh.

1192
01:18:37,103 --> 01:18:40,064
She can still outrun us
and outgun us,

1193
01:18:40,147 --> 01:18:43,567
But there is the Mutara Nebula
at 153 mark 4.

1194
01:18:43,651 --> 01:18:45,653
Scotty, can we make it inside?

1195
01:18:45,736 --> 01:18:48,239
The energizer's bypassed
like a Christmas tree,

1196
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:50,741
so don't give me
too many bumps.

1197
01:18:50,741 --> 01:18:52,201
No promises.
On your way.

1198
01:18:52,243 --> 01:18:53,744
Trouble with
the nebula, sir,

1199
01:18:53,744 --> 01:18:55,746
is all that static
discharging gas

1200
01:18:55,788 --> 01:18:57,248
clouds our
tactical display.

1201
01:18:57,248 --> 01:19:00,251
Visual won't function,
and shields will be useless.

1202
01:19:01,544 --> 01:19:04,004
Sauce for the goose,
Mr. Saavik.

1203
01:19:05,339 --> 01:19:07,258
The odds will be even.

1204
01:19:41,041 --> 01:19:42,460
Alley clear, sir.

1205
01:19:43,961 --> 01:19:45,337
Repairing second.

1206
01:19:45,337 --> 01:19:47,298
Ready to fire away 1 .

1207
01:19:53,179 --> 01:19:55,890
There she is!

1208
01:19:55,973 --> 01:19:58,058
There she is.

1209
01:19:58,142 --> 01:20:00,644
Ahh.

1210
01:20:00,728 --> 01:20:04,565
Not so wounded
as we were led to believe.

1211
01:20:04,648 --> 01:20:06,150
So much the better.

1212
01:20:31,091 --> 01:20:35,596
Estimating nebula penetration
in 2.2 minutes.

1213
01:20:37,473 --> 01:20:39,183
Reliant is closing.

1214
01:20:48,609 --> 01:20:52,029
If they go in there,
we'll lose them.

1215
01:20:52,071 --> 01:20:53,781
Explain it to them.

1216
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:05,626
That was close.

1217
01:21:05,626 --> 01:21:08,254
They just don't want us
going in there.

1218
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:17,888
One minute
to nebula perimeter.

1219
01:21:17,972 --> 01:21:19,473
Why are we slowing?

1220
01:21:20,808 --> 01:21:23,811
We daren't follow them
into the nebula, sir.

1221
01:21:23,853 --> 01:21:25,813
Our shields
would be useless.

1222
01:21:28,607 --> 01:21:30,985
They are reducing speed.

1223
01:21:31,068 --> 01:21:32,736
Uhura, patch me in.

1224
01:21:32,778 --> 01:21:34,655
Aye, sir.

1225
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:36,157
You're on, Admiral.

1226
01:21:37,450 --> 01:21:38,826
This is Admiral Kirk.

1227
01:21:38,951 --> 01:21:41,328
We tried it once
your way, Khan.

1228
01:21:41,412 --> 01:21:43,497
Are you game
for a rematch?

1229
01:21:43,581 --> 01:21:45,332
Khan.

1230
01:21:46,834 --> 01:21:49,420
I'm laughing at
the superior intellect.

1231
01:21:51,505 --> 01:21:53,841
Full impulse power.

1232
01:21:53,924 --> 01:21:55,342
No, sir!

1233
01:21:55,426 --> 01:21:58,429
You have Genesis.
You can have whatever you-

1234
01:21:58,429 --> 01:22:00,014
Full power!

1235
01:22:00,097 --> 01:22:01,390
Damn you!

1236
01:22:06,687 --> 01:22:09,607
I'll say this for him-
he's consistent.

1237
01:22:11,108 --> 01:22:14,111
We are now entering
the Mutara Nebula.

1238
01:22:23,287 --> 01:22:24,205
Emergency lights.

1239
01:22:46,644 --> 01:22:47,812
Oh!

1240
01:22:54,819 --> 01:22:55,694
Tactical.

1241
01:22:57,905 --> 01:22:59,073
Inoperative.

1242
01:23:02,743 --> 01:23:04,245
Raise the shields.

1243
01:23:05,329 --> 01:23:08,332
As I feared, sir-
not functional.

1244
01:23:08,415 --> 01:23:09,834
I'm reducing speed.

1245
01:23:51,959 --> 01:23:52,877
Target, sir.

1246
01:23:53,002 --> 01:23:54,462
Phaser lock
inoperative, sir.

1247
01:23:54,545 --> 01:23:57,298
Best guess, Mr. Sulu.
Fire when ready.

1248
01:24:05,139 --> 01:24:06,557
Oh!

1249
01:24:06,599 --> 01:24:08,642
Aft torpedoes, fire!

1250
01:24:17,234 --> 01:24:18,652
Hold your course.

1251
01:24:41,675 --> 01:24:42,551
Phasers starboard!

1252
01:24:51,894 --> 01:24:53,938
Aah!

1253
01:24:53,979 --> 01:24:54,939
Fire!

1254
01:25:16,961 --> 01:25:18,462
Damage, Mr. Scott.

1255
01:25:20,464 --> 01:25:24,385
Admiral, I've got to take
the mains off the line.

1256
01:25:24,468 --> 01:25:26,470
It's radiation...

1257
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:27,888
Scotty.

1258
01:25:27,930 --> 01:25:29,306
Joachim.

1259
01:25:31,517 --> 01:25:32,560
Yours...

1260
01:25:33,978 --> 01:25:36,480
is a superior...

1261
01:25:44,321 --> 01:25:45,823
I shall avenge you.

1262
01:25:56,167 --> 01:25:59,170
Could you use
another hand, Admiral?

1263
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:01,422
Man the weapons console,
Mr. Chekov.

1264
01:26:06,469 --> 01:26:07,678
Spock.

1265
01:26:07,761 --> 01:26:10,347
Sporadic energy readings,
port side aft.

1266
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:12,349
Could be
an impulse turn.

1267
01:26:14,185 --> 01:26:17,438
He won't
break off now.

1268
01:26:17,521 --> 01:26:20,483
He followed me this far.
He'll be back.

1269
01:26:22,026 --> 01:26:24,779
But from where?

1270
01:26:24,862 --> 01:26:28,365
He's intelligent,
but not experienced.

1271
01:26:28,407 --> 01:26:31,786
His pattern indicates
two-dimensional thinking.

1272
01:26:38,459 --> 01:26:39,460
Full stop.

1273
01:26:39,543 --> 01:26:40,961
Full stop, sir.

1274
01:26:42,296 --> 01:26:43,798
Z minus
10,000 meters.

1275
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:45,299
Stand by
photon torpedoes.

1276
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:40,521
Torpedoes ready, sir.

1277
01:27:52,116 --> 01:27:53,200
Look sharp.

1278
01:27:57,204 --> 01:27:58,539
Fire.

1279
01:28:04,128 --> 01:28:05,045
Aah!

1280
01:28:05,129 --> 01:28:06,130
Fire.

1281
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:11,093
- Aah!
- Aah!

1282
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:17,725
Aah!

1283
01:28:38,829 --> 01:28:39,330
Uhura...

1284
01:28:39,330 --> 01:28:40,664
Uhura...

1285
01:28:40,748 --> 01:28:43,667
send to Commander, Reliant.

1286
01:28:43,751 --> 01:28:45,169
Prepare to be boarded.

1287
01:28:45,252 --> 01:28:46,170
Aye, sir.

1288
01:28:47,838 --> 01:28:50,341
Commander, Reliant.
This is Enterprise.

1289
01:28:50,341 --> 01:28:54,094
Surrender and prepare
to be boarded.

1290
01:28:54,178 --> 01:28:55,596
Enterprise to Reliant.

1291
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:58,099
You are ordered to
surrender your vessel.

1292
01:28:58,182 --> 01:28:59,100
Respond.

1293
01:29:10,361 --> 01:29:12,029
Reliant. Come in, Reliant.

1294
01:29:13,197 --> 01:29:16,033
You are ordered to surrender
your vessel.

1295
01:29:16,117 --> 01:29:17,535
Enterprise to Reliant.

1296
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:20,788
You are ordered to surrender
your vessel. Respond.

1297
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:37,096
No, Kirk.

1298
01:29:38,681 --> 01:29:40,391
The game's not over.

1299
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:21,265
To the last
I will grapple with thee.

1300
01:30:35,613 --> 01:30:37,031
Admiral.

1301
01:30:37,114 --> 01:30:40,618
Scanning an energy
source on Reliant.

1302
01:30:40,701 --> 01:30:43,120
A pattern I've
never seen before.

1303
01:30:48,626 --> 01:30:50,211
It's the Genesis wave.

1304
01:30:50,294 --> 01:30:51,212
What?

1305
01:30:51,295 --> 01:30:54,632
They're on a build-up
to detonation.

1306
01:30:54,715 --> 01:30:55,633
How soon?

1307
01:30:55,716 --> 01:30:57,468
We encoded four minutes.

1308
01:30:57,551 --> 01:30:59,970
We'll beam aboard
and stop it.

1309
01:31:00,054 --> 01:31:00,971
You can't.

1310
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:06,727
Scotty, I need warp speed
in three minutes

1311
01:31:06,811 --> 01:31:08,312
or we're all dead.

1312
01:31:09,563 --> 01:31:10,981
No response, Admiral.

1313
01:31:11,065 --> 01:31:12,233
Scotty.

1314
01:31:12,316 --> 01:31:15,236
Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Best possible speed.

1315
01:31:15,319 --> 01:31:16,237
Aye, sir.

1316
01:31:53,524 --> 01:31:56,527
Are you out
of your Vulcan mind?

1317
01:31:56,527 --> 01:31:59,029
No human can tolerate
the radiation in there!

1318
01:31:59,029 --> 01:32:01,532
As you are so fond
of observing, Doctor,

1319
01:32:01,532 --> 01:32:03,033
I am not human.

1320
01:32:03,033 --> 01:32:05,870
You're not going in there.

1321
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:09,707
Perhaps you're right.

1322
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:12,293
What is
Mr. Scott's condition?

1323
01:32:12,293 --> 01:32:14,295
Well, I don't think
that he-

1324
01:32:14,295 --> 01:32:15,713
I'm sorry, Doctor.

1325
01:32:15,796 --> 01:32:18,716
I have no time
to discuss this logically.

1326
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:23,971
Remember.

1327
01:32:34,064 --> 01:32:36,817
Spock! Get out of there!

1328
01:32:36,901 --> 01:32:38,068
Spock!

1329
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:40,070
Spock, get out of there!

1330
01:32:50,998 --> 01:32:52,416
Time, from my mark.

1331
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,752
2 minutes, 10 seconds.

1332
01:32:54,835 --> 01:32:56,754
Engine room...

1333
01:32:56,837 --> 01:32:57,755
what's happening?

1334
01:32:57,838 --> 01:33:00,090
Spock! Scotty...

1335
01:33:00,174 --> 01:33:02,843
Good God, man!
Get out of there!

1336
01:33:02,927 --> 01:33:03,928
No! Don't!

1337
01:33:04,011 --> 01:33:05,429
Spock! Spock!

1338
01:33:05,513 --> 01:33:06,764
Don't!

1339
01:33:36,043 --> 01:33:37,711
Time.

1340
01:33:39,463 --> 01:33:41,799
3 minutes, 30 seconds.

1341
01:33:47,638 --> 01:33:49,306
Distance from Reliant.

1342
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:51,308
4,000 kilometers.

1343
01:33:51,392 --> 01:33:54,061
We're not going
to make it, are we?

1344
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:07,241
No.

1345
01:34:08,659 --> 01:34:11,328
No, you can't get away.

1346
01:34:13,747 --> 01:34:18,085
From hell's heart,
I stab at thee.

1347
01:34:19,753 --> 01:34:22,006
For hate's sake,

1348
01:34:22,089 --> 01:34:27,094
I spit my last breath
at thee.

1349
01:34:38,939 --> 01:34:41,692
Sir, the mains
are back on line.

1350
01:34:41,776 --> 01:34:43,527
Bless you, Scotty.
Go, Sulu!

1351
01:35:27,238 --> 01:35:29,740
My God, Carol,
look at it.

1352
01:35:41,669 --> 01:35:42,753
Engine room.

1353
01:35:44,505 --> 01:35:46,757
Well done, Scotty.

1354
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:48,509
Jim...

1355
01:35:48,592 --> 01:35:51,762
I think you'd better
get down here.

1356
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:52,763
Bones?

1357
01:35:53,931 --> 01:35:55,599
Better hurry.

1358
01:35:58,853 --> 01:36:00,271
Saavik, take the con.

1359
01:36:28,883 --> 01:36:31,469
No! You'll flood
the whole compartment.

1360
01:36:31,552 --> 01:36:32,470
He'll die.

1361
01:36:32,553 --> 01:36:34,722
Sir, he's dead already.

1362
01:36:39,226 --> 01:36:40,644
It's too late.

1363
01:37:03,334 --> 01:37:04,502
Spock!

1364
01:37:35,282 --> 01:37:36,367
Ship...

1365
01:37:37,868 --> 01:37:39,286
out of danger?

1366
01:37:41,038 --> 01:37:42,039
Yes.

1367
01:37:45,709 --> 01:37:48,212
Don't grieve, Admiral.

1368
01:37:50,881 --> 01:37:52,299
It is logical.

1369
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:59,140
The needs of the many
outweigh...

1370
01:38:01,475 --> 01:38:03,310
The needs of the few...

1371
01:38:04,478 --> 01:38:05,980
Or the one.

1372
01:38:14,738 --> 01:38:19,243
I never took
the Kobayashi Maru test...

1373
01:38:20,744 --> 01:38:21,829
until now.

1374
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:27,251
What do you think
of my solution?

1375
01:38:29,503 --> 01:38:30,588
Spock...

1376
01:38:40,514 --> 01:38:41,432
I...

1377
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,435
I have been...

1378
01:38:44,518 --> 01:38:47,021
and always
shall be...

1379
01:38:47,021 --> 01:38:48,355
your friend.

1380
01:38:54,445 --> 01:38:55,946
Live long...

1381
01:38:57,531 --> 01:38:58,449
and prosper.

1382
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:21,722
No.

1383
01:39:41,992 --> 01:39:44,662
We are assembled here today

1384
01:39:44,745 --> 01:39:47,665
To pay final respects
to our honored dead.

1385
01:39:53,254 --> 01:39:55,172
And yet it should be noted

1386
01:39:55,256 --> 01:39:57,675
that in the midst
of our sorrow,

1387
01:39:57,758 --> 01:40:01,512
this death takes place
in the shadow of new life,

1388
01:40:01,512 --> 01:40:04,181
the sunrise of a new world,

1389
01:40:04,181 --> 01:40:06,350
a world
that our beloved comrade

1390
01:40:06,434 --> 01:40:08,269
gave his life to protect.

1391
01:40:08,352 --> 01:40:10,104
He did not feel

1392
01:40:10,187 --> 01:40:13,107
this sacrifice a vain
or empty one,

1393
01:40:13,190 --> 01:40:15,609
and we will not debate
his profound wisdom

1394
01:40:15,693 --> 01:40:17,111
at these proceedings.

1395
01:40:20,531 --> 01:40:23,451
Of my friend,
I can only say this-

1396
01:40:28,122 --> 01:40:32,460
of all the souls I have
encountered in my travels,

1397
01:40:32,543 --> 01:40:33,961
his was the most...

1398
01:40:37,798 --> 01:40:38,716
human.

1399
01:40:40,885 --> 01:40:42,386
Honors...

1400
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:43,387
Hup.

1401
01:42:07,471 --> 01:42:08,472
Come.

1402
01:42:12,226 --> 01:42:14,145
I don't mean to intrude.

1403
01:42:15,312 --> 01:42:17,231
No, not at all.

1404
01:42:17,314 --> 01:42:19,984
I should be
on the bridge.

1405
01:42:20,067 --> 01:42:22,987
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

1406
01:42:23,070 --> 01:42:26,323
I poured myself a drink.
Would you like it?

1407
01:42:26,407 --> 01:42:27,825
Lieutenant Saavik
was right.

1408
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:31,078
You never have
faced death.

1409
01:42:40,838 --> 01:42:42,256
No, not like this.

1410
01:42:45,426 --> 01:42:47,762
I haven't faced death.

1411
01:42:47,845 --> 01:42:49,263
I've cheated death.

1412
01:42:52,183 --> 01:42:55,102
I've tricked my way
out of death

1413
01:42:55,186 --> 01:42:58,606
and patted myself on the back
for my ingenuity.

1414
01:43:02,026 --> 01:43:03,360
I know nothing.

1415
01:43:03,444 --> 01:43:05,362
You knew enough
to tell Saavik

1416
01:43:05,446 --> 01:43:06,864
that how we faced death

1417
01:43:06,947 --> 01:43:11,285
is at least as important
as how we face life.

1418
01:43:11,368 --> 01:43:12,620
Just words.

1419
01:43:12,703 --> 01:43:14,121
But good words.

1420
01:43:15,623 --> 01:43:18,042
That's where ideas begin.

1421
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:20,544
Maybe you should
listen to them.

1422
01:43:23,047 --> 01:43:24,965
I was wrong about you...

1423
01:43:26,133 --> 01:43:27,551
and I'm sorry.

1424
01:43:30,554 --> 01:43:32,973
Is that what
you came here to say?

1425
01:43:34,892 --> 01:43:35,810
Mainly.

1426
01:43:42,566 --> 01:43:44,735
And also that I'm...

1427
01:43:46,153 --> 01:43:47,154
proud.

1428
01:43:49,156 --> 01:43:51,158
Very proud...

1429
01:43:51,242 --> 01:43:52,660
to be your son.

1430
01:44:22,273 --> 01:44:25,943
Captain 's Log. Stardate 8141.6.

1431
01:44:26,026 --> 01:44:28,946
Starship Enterprise
departing for Ceti Alpha V

1432
01:44:29,029 --> 01:44:31,949
to pick up the crew
of U.S.S. Reliant.

1433
01:44:32,032 --> 01:44:33,451
All is well.

1434
01:44:33,534 --> 01:44:35,953
And yet
I can't help wondering

1435
01:44:36,036 --> 01:44:38,205
about the friend
I leave behind.

1436
01:44:40,374 --> 01:44:43,210
,'There are always
possibilities, ,'Spock said.

1437
01:44:43,294 --> 01:44:46,297
And if Genesis is indeed

1438
01:44:46,297 --> 01:44:48,215
life from death...

1439
01:44:49,467 --> 01:44:52,470
I must return
to this place again.

1440
01:44:56,807 --> 01:44:58,225
He's really not dead...

1441
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:01,979
as long as
we remember him.

1442
01:45:08,068 --> 01:45:10,988
It's a far, far
better thing I do

1443
01:45:11,071 --> 01:45:13,491
than I have
ever done before.

1444
01:45:15,409 --> 01:45:20,164
A far better
resting place I go to

1445
01:45:20,247 --> 01:45:22,249
than I have ever known.

1446
01:45:22,333 --> 01:45:23,834
Is that a poem?

1447
01:45:23,834 --> 01:45:24,835
No.

1448
01:45:26,086 --> 01:45:28,506
Something Spock was trying
to tell me

1449
01:45:28,589 --> 01:45:30,007
on my birthday.

1450
01:45:30,091 --> 01:45:31,842
You OK, Jim?

1451
01:45:33,677 --> 01:45:35,096
How do you feel?

1452
01:45:38,015 --> 01:45:38,933
Young.

1453
01:45:43,437 --> 01:45:45,022
I feel young.

1454
01:46:57,845 --> 01:47:01,932
Space,
the final frontier.

1455
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:04,602
These are
the continuing voyages

1456
01:47:04,685 --> 01:47:08,939
of the starship Enterprise.

1457
01:47:09,023 --> 01:47:11,275
Her ongoing mission,

1458
01:47:11,358 --> 01:47:15,529
to explore
strange, new worlds,

1459
01:47:15,613 --> 01:47:21,368
to seek out new life forms
and new civilizations,

1460
01:47:21,368 --> 01:47:25,873
to boldly go
where no man has gone...

1461
01:47:25,956 --> 01:47:27,708
